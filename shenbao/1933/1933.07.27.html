<h3>論廉潔楚</h3>
<p>今之有心人每致槪於政治之無辦法由於官吏之貪汚而黨國要人亦恒以廉潔自勵。兼以之勗勉其僚屬己可謂至再至三然而貪汚黑暗之現象。仍不能絶跡於今日之政治界也。夫貪汚與廉潔。絶對不能兩立。而在今日不平之社會中。必不能產生絶對廉潔之政治。縱有一二廉吏。欲於此汚濁之環境中。卓然有所建白亦終必至於同流合汚而止。徵之前史。歷歷不爽。前淸咸同之交。洪楊建國於南京。淸吏曾國藩胡林翼輩起兵湘鄂。以與太平軍對抗。唯曾胡皆漢人。淸廷不之信。特簡旗人官文爲兩湖總督。監臨其旁。官文以貪汚　。胡時巡撫湖北。頗惡之。一日忽念及此。擬具摺奏參官之失德。揭其招權納賄之跡於朝廷。繞室徬徨。莫能自决。時阎端敏公居幕中。怪而問之。公以實告閻曰不可。官某雖貪每年不過耗公數十萬金耳然其爲人。昏庸無遠志。故悉舉大政以屬於公公乃得從容展其抱負。若官某去。來一精敏强幹之人。事必躬親。公將一事不可爲。胡大悟。遂極力交驩官文。官文益事事聽胡胡之所以能爲淸室中興名臣者。以閻此言之力爲多。然而貪汚勢力之不可掃除。亦可槪見。</p>
<p>淸之未造。馮煦官皖撫。頗以漢時循吏自持。其寮幕亦皆不敢不以廉潔相勉。唯馮以辦徐錫麟刺恩撫案。不滿於恩之親屬忌者因造作蜚語。謂馮袒革命黨。淸廷密派振貝子查辦。振向馮索賄十萬元。馮以廉吏囊槖中未嘗有絲毫民脂民膏足供逢迎對。未幾馮遂開缺。此又見貪汚之足以敗壞廉潔政治也。</p>
<p>前者以迎合貪汚之權貴而苟全。後則以獲罪於貪汚之權貴而罷官。史册所載。比比皆是。古人有言。『國家之敗由官邪也、官之失德竉賂章也。』官邪賂章。貪汚相競。於今可謂烈矣。然而吾儕論事。不應徒持倫理道德觀念。徒歎人心不古。蓋國事敗壞。固十九敗於貪汚。而貪汚何自而生。與廉潔何自而亡。則絶非理學家仁義信道等種種抽象名詞所能解决。蓋必追尋其發生之因與其滅亡之源而治理之。始可與言天下事。</p>
<p>愚前己言之矣。』在今日不平社會中必不能產生絶對廉潔之政治『蓋社會中旣有不勞而獲者。必有終歲勤勤而一無所有者佔有一切與一無所有者對立。則特權社會以生。官吏之權日重。紳士之勢力日大。然後驕奢淫佚之習與貪贓枉法之事。相緣而起。故居今日而欲實行廉潔政治必先有以革除此矛盾現象。遏止此官紳無限制之勢力。一方對於貪汚官吏。加以嚴刑峻罰。官大者罰尤重。勿徒彈劾狐狸而不問豺狼。國事庶幾可爲。不然者。口頭文告徒。成掩飾之具。而廉潔二字。終將無由實現耳。</p>

<h3>向局請願增卹</h3>
<p>在總務科内大鬧</p>
<p>被捕房探捕驅散</p>
<p>招商局圖南輪海員被難者、已經局方各卹一年薪金、不足五百元者、則由均安會補足之、惟海員中有一部分家屬、因依照海員工會籌備處之請求、每名被難海員、須卹金一千元、並承認子女之敎育費、先由被難海員維持會名義、向局方要求、而局中未予置答、致昨日上午、大批海員家族、到局請願、並搗毁物件、茲將詳情分述如下、</p>
<h3>家屬請願到局</h3>
<p>昨日上午十時四十五分、圖南輪被難海員家屬三十餘人、其中多數爲婦女、携帶小孩者亦有之、雇得搬塲汽車三輛、至招商局内請願、增加撫卹、先到營業科交</p>
<p>涉、當由局員述明此事爲總務科承辦、不歸營業科事、各家屬遂向二樓、蜂擁而上、至總務科前、大哭大鬧不止、且有男子數人、更攔入總務科辦事室内、因該科未有人、與各家屬接洽、而各家屬亦無代表出爲陳述、一味吵鬧與號哭、並臥在樓板之上、</p>
<h3>搗毁局内公物</h3>
<p>其時請願家屬、見局内職員、置之不理、乃有數人、直入寫字間、將辦事桌上物件、盡行擲抛至地、又將茶几一隻擊壞、更敲破該科玻璃窗面兩方、並毁壞電燈等零物、當塲爲該科人員、出爲勒阻、並勸各人退出寫字間外、聽候總經理核奪、</p>
<h3>捕房驅散羣衆</h3>
<p>在此哭鬧搗物之際、總務科已報告劉鴻生請示、劉總經理乃命該局庶務員史維俊等、出與各家屬接洽、詢問請願事件、應推代表陳述、不能挾衆滋吵毁物、經各家族述明、爲請增卹至每人千元、其時局内巡捕、恐肇禍端、卽電四馬路總巡捕房報告、十時許、捕房大隊巡捕到來、乃將此項滋擾之男女老小盡行驅散出局、並將在局搗毁物件之人、帶入捕房、旋於十二時後、該帶去之人、亦經捕房開釋、</p>
<h3>海員工會商議</h3>
<p>局内以被難工友、每名給卹五百元、歷届出事、均如此辦理、並未苛待、比較其他輪局、已屬優惠、今各家屬請願增卹、而又要求敎育費等等、未免過於奢望、當塲局方亦祇得緩勸、容與海員工會籌備會恊商後、再行答復、昨日劉總經理、已派員到海員工會籌備討論此事矣、聞各海員家屬、亦到海員工會、要求該會起而援助、</p>
<p>撤廢輪船買辦制</p>
<h3>招商開始試辦</h3>
<p>普安新銘改用事務長</p>
<p>决聘洋員敎授專門學</p>
<p>我國輪船、向來將理貨與搭客兩部分事務、委託買辦負責、不受船主管理、此種畸形制度、爲世界航輪界所無、流弊所及、遂使船員與業務、事權不一、而茶房侍役、又濫行雇用、妨害航運、有擾行旅、故交部特命令滬上國輪、趕將此項買辦制廢除、招商局業已首先實行、惟因關係頗大、暫從試辦入手、</p>
<h3>部令廢買辦</h3>
<p>交通部、以世界任何各國商輪、不論貨運與載客、統歸船主總轄、其責任與職務、分撥與大二副等掌理之、並無另用買辦、以　負理貨與客票等事者、故船中事權、可以　一致、船主負全輪之責、其他船員、則對船主負責、獨於我國、不論長江近海各船、均於船員之外、另用買辦、而買辦更可自由收入押櫃、或保證金、濫用茶房、旣無薪給、乃不得不聽其來帶稍包、向客索取酒資、如寗波輪船茶房、更雇下手、重重需索、常起糾紛、往往一船之上、茶房一役、有超過全部船員名額之上者、追源其故、均買辦制之所造成、故整理船務、必先由廢除此項買辦制始、因令滬上華商各輪、一致遵行、</p>
<h3>招商試新制</h3>
<p>招商局現爲國營性質、改革航務、當居領袖地位、頃自奉到交部訓令後、總經理劉鴻生、卽與各科主任、磋商革除各輪船買辦包繳制度、而將各輪之客票事宜、由局收回自辦、船務科主任趙雲台、在接事之始、早就提出此項主張、惟因事實上、有種種　碍、未能一時全部實行、而討論結果、先將本局頭等海輪普安·新銘·兩艘、爲試行廢除買辦、打破包繳制之模範船、重訂船内業務職權、而於船員之外、添委事務長各一員、令其專管搭客事務、及全輪之淸潔衛生事項、客票則實報實銷、事權屬於總局、在輪則受船主管轄</p>
<h3>訓練新人材</h3>
<p>招商局總理劉鴻生、以廢除買辦、事在必行、惟缺乏此項管理客位及整潔全船之事務專門人材、而普安新銘兩輪試行新制以來、成績亦甚平常、故劉氏特向理事會提出訓練事務人員、聘用專門西人、在局招學員敎授、以備派赴各輪、改施新制度之議案、略謂奉部令革廢各輪買辦、已先將普安新銘兩船試行、惟本局江海各輪尙多、均爲買辦制、各業務主任、以包繳性質、顃皆偏重營業、而於船内之各種設置與衛生淸潔、自少注意、遂令旅客不滿、今本局所借英庚欵購用之江海各新輪、在明春亦可來滬開航、此項新船、自當悉照新制、不用業務主任、但我國殊少航輪事務專才、必須及時訓練備派各輪服務、應由本局聘請航輪事務之事門洋員一人或兩人、就局内招集學員、由該西人敎授管理船舶之事務學識備代替買辦之用、業由理事曾通過、准劉總理聘請專門洋員、至局内訓練專材矣、</p>
<h3>茶房起恐慌</h3>
<p>新銘輪爲北洋班之頭等輪船内茶房侍役甚夥、此次自業務主任謝君辭職後、局内已將理貨客票等事、收歸局内自辦、不再派業務主任、而改試新制、委陳某任事務長、直隸局中、惟船内茶房、多數納有保證金、而由前任業務主任雇用者、亦不給工薪、全恃向旅客收取酒資、以爲生活、人數甚夥、現聞局中變更制度、擬將茶房改爲工薪制、不收證金、而限定名額、且禁止向客需索酒資、該輪各茶房、已起恐慌、蓋慮裁减名額、妨及生計、及於昨晨、推派代表、至局詢問、但尙未有眉目也、</p>
<p>監察委員</p>
<h3>高一涵到寳視察海塘</h3>
<p>監察院高監察委員一涵、於昨午到寳山、視察海塘、由金縣長·宛之任·及地方人士陶雲時等、陪同前往、四時許回城、各機關代表及地方人士、假欵產處開會歡迎、面遞節略、護塘委員王奏雲·潘孟翹·及黨部委員劉樸眞等、先後陳述塘工危險情形、轉瞬秋汛大潮、若不籌撥鉅欵、先事預防、則张患不堪設想、一經潰决、恐更甚於前年漢口高郵、繼由高監委答詞、説明中央對於海塘非常注意、正在設法經費、以爲治本之計、目下急則治標辦法、省方允先籌撥四萬餘元、復由到會人士環請高監委、轉催省廳、尅日照發、散會已近六時、聞尚須赴松江太倉等處、察看塘工、然後回京報告、</p>

<h3>國貨產銷聯合公司</h3>
<p>生產救國之新陣線</p>
<p>自九一八國難以後、國人於痛憤之餘、深知在此經濟鬥爭之時代中、苟非力求生產、充實國力、决不足言圖存雪恥、因是提倡國貨、建設實業等工作、遂成爲愛國人士共同努力之目標、上海國貨公司與中國國貨公司之能先後成爲南京路上國難以後保護經濟外溢之壁壘者以此、然</p>
<p>國貨公司僅爲恊助國貨推銷之一種機關、尙非足使產銷雙方發生充分互助充分合作之組織、於是組織國貨產銷聯合機關之理想、又成爲生產救國主張中之一種要求、五月赴美參加芝加哥博覽會各省出品代表來滬、所有各種出品、極爲滬上中外人士所歡迎、因感各種出品之不　能流通、實爲缺乏聯絡機關所致、於是江西湖南江蘇福建等省出品代表周貫虹·王松遊·邵德輝·柳厚民·張文棣·王世傑董焜藩·吳廣智·等在出國之前、商請全國商會聯合會主席林康候·上海市商會主席王曉籟·實業界鄔志豪·銀行界王伯元等、等發起組織中華國貨產銷聯合公司欲以聯合國貨產銷合作爲引線、以創造生產救國之新陣線、王曉籟林康侯鄔志豪王伯元等、俱贊其議、遂在寗波實業銀行大厦、設立籌備處、並公推王曉籟爲籌備處正主任、林康侯鄔志豪爲副主任、王伯元·陸祺生·任矝蘋·王松遊·王松圃·吳廣智·柳厚民·董焜藩·爲籌備委員、朱德超爲總幹事、共同籌劃進行、嗣爲力謀辦事上之急進起見、復由籌備委員會議組幹事會、請林萬琅爲主任幹事、王屏南·王劍鍔·吳廣智·朱德超·郭永熙、任矜蘋·爲幹事、分頭辦理籌備工作、</p>
<h3>參加發起之踴躍</h3>
<p>自中華國貨產銷</p>
<p>聯合公司開始籌備後、各界熱心人士、無不聞風　加入、截至昨日止、業已簽名加入發起者、除王曉籟林康侯·鄔志豪·及參加芝加哥博覽會各省出品代表外、先後簽名發起者、計有史量才·張公權·陳光甫劉鴻生·宋子良·許世英·莊崧甫·虞洽卿·金廷蓀·徐新六·俞佐廷·吳蘊齋·李明揚·葉扶霄·吳蔚如·徐永祚·陸伯鴻·徐懋棠·郭順·金侯城·馮仲卿·薛篤弼·潘公展·張竹平·　延芳·江一平·王彬彥·蔡無忌許廷佐·胡西圍·李萬里·褚　僧·王伯度·周邦俊·陳繩武·俞國珍·項繩武·鄭澄淸·諸文綺·鄔志和·葉榮鈞洪　仁·卓雨亭·鄔雲程·陳翊周·鄔挺生·姜證禪·徐春榮·曹國華·盧成章·王仲元·葉道淵·林萬琅·楊永年·王屏南·胡叔仁·任矜蘋·王鴻賚·孫級蘭·洪荆山·王劍鍔·秦善寳·汪寳棠·傳芳廷·朱德超·陸祺生·等數十人、預料在召集發起人會時、必尙有熱心國貨人士踴躍參加云</p>
<h3>銀行公會之宴會</h3>
<p>中華國貨產銷聯合公司籌備主任王曉籟·林康侯·鄔志豪·爲報告組織公司旨趣起見、特於昨日假座銀行公會、宴請各界、到者有孔庸之·宋漢章·等數十人、席間、由王曉籟·林康侯·鄔志豪·薛篤弼·褚慧僧·先後發表意見、最後由任矜蘋代表幹事會、報告公司之營業綱要、及至晚間十時餘、始各盡歡而散、</p>
<h3>王曉籟演詞</h3>
<p>在此嚴重國難時期中、</p>
<p>吾人以提倡國貨爲生產救國之號召、或有嫌其迂緩者、但徒責迂緩、而又無其他迅速救國之方法、以資實行、則行必勝於不行也、且此種迂緩之努力、實爲發展經濟建設實力之根本工作、可爲前方抗敵義軍培養輸捐之源泉、可爲政府長其抵抗建設堅强之後援、若全國國民俱能切實努力生產救匣之工作、則復仇雪恥、爲期必不在遠、吾人發起組織中華國貨產銷聯合公司之目的　、欲使國貨產方與銷方合成一片、不獨欲使各省土產及出品得以流通無阻、並欲使各省土產與出品得藉以增加產量改良進步、而安定各方人民之生活、將來逐步進行、必使各省各地俱有分公司、而能相互爲助、共謀發揮、以達生產救國之目的、故此種公司、並不純以營利爲主觀、而欲藉互助合作之力量、以發揮工商救國之意　、甚望各界人士、熱烈參加、卽不然、亦請時賜批評、以資遵循云、</p>
<h3>林康侯演詞</h3>
<p>吾人發起組織中華國貨產觘聯合公司之動機、實始於赴美參加芝加哥博覽會各省出品代表之創議、蓋各省參加芝加哥博覽會各種出品、運抵上海後、頗爲上海中外人士所歡迎、倘以前己有此組織、則是項出品、必早在上海行銷、最近得赴美參加芝加哥博覽會各代表報告、該會中國館每日參觀人數、平均在一萬五各人以上、且多樂購各種特製出品、如江西瓷器·宜興陶器·福建漆器·及湘南繡品等、俱已來電添裝、是可知向國外推銷國貨、亦極可能、徒以往昔無人組織機關、注意國際貿易、不獨使我國對外貿易統計減去不少數字、且使國内人民、失去不少生產之機會、又有不少愛國人士及熱心華僑、意欲購辦國貨、而苦於不知何者爲國貨、何處可得國貨、諸如此類、皆因產銷雙方無聯合之組織、而驅逐國人購買外貨也、此次吾人贊成參加芝加哥博覽會各省出品代表之動機、發起組織中華國貨產銷聯合公司、使國内國外足以增加國產量購買力之利益、不致坐視遺漏也、</p>
<h3>鄔志豪演説</h3>
<p>今日到會諸公、均爲本公司之發起人、又爲素來熱心扶助實業之前輩先生、夫救國之道甚多、大者如食糧國防經濟敎育水利、而最需要者還是經濟、因以上諸端、均需經濟能力之扶助、現在國家現狀、外有强敵之侵迫、内患農村之破產外貨侵銷、國產衰落、整個金融、日趨枯竭、若不急謀救濟、則民窮財盡、何以自存、近械熱心愛國人士、都努力於經營經濟、救國之道、如復興農村、改良絲茶、建設魚業、提倡匣貨、上下一致、積極進行、本公司籌備組織之意義、卽欲盡其微薄、以自效於國家、諸公成竹在胸、必有良好計劃、隨時賜敎、次第進行、鄙人亦以一得之見、貢獻於諸君之前、夫我國地大物博、因交通之不便、經濟之不足、商業之守舊、各省物產、不能互相流通、以致貨棄於地有之、污塞圩積者有之、而各方需要者、工業缺乏代給、供求不應、使外貨輸入、漸漸增加、所以本公司聯絡各界熱心人士、搜羅專門人才、集合經濟力量、使生產者與銷費者雙方聯合、使國内物產供求相應、本公司以經濟人才實業三者合作、實行下列之工作、（一）恊助各省各地設立國貨貿易商號、與本公司合作、以流通各地之物產、（二）恊助各工廠予以經濟人才之扶助、一方則供給原料、一方則改良出品、使成本減低、出品精良、（三）注重國際貿易常聞各地華僑愛國之心、不下於國内人士、因無國貨盡量供給、祗得購用外貨、故本公司聯絡海外華僑、組織貿易商號、使國貨能暢銷於國外、其他如聯合金融界、分設國貨公棧及國貨押滙業務、貢獻政府實行保護之税率、促進交通業務、使運輸之便利請求政府、設沿途貨物之保護、以上諸端、盡爲本公司之業務、待公司成立之後、依次進行、惟茲事體大、非集中國内外熱心志士、羣策羣力、使底於成、又希望今日在座諸公、及未到會之發起人、多多介紹熱心人士參加發起以厚基礎、而利進行、</p>
<h3>薛篤弼演詞</h3>

<p>救濟戰區失業工人</p>
<p>中央社云、本市社會局、近擬於高境區舉辦平民工廠一所、茲將進行近况、探錄如下、</p>
<h3>最大目的</h3>
<p>此事之發動、尙在三四月之前、其所以欲舉辦該項工廠之最大目的　、乃在救濟戰區失業工人、蓋自一二八案發生、閘北江灣等區工廠、幾全爲砲火所燬滅、祇以印刷業工廠而論、倒閉者有六七十家之多、失業工人、達四千餘人、其中以商務印書館及勞動大學印刷部之工人、占其大半、故晨初擬於戰區内　辦一印刷工廠、以救濟四千餘失業之印刷工人、終以經費關係、未能實現、</p>
<h3>草擬計劃</h3>
<p>其後市府發行慈善賽馬奬、其所餘之欵、原定復興戰區之用、爰經社會局局長吳亞、面請市長、撥給三萬元、以作舉辦平民工廠之資金、當舉市長囑先熟籌計劃、呈請核示後、再行定奪、當經吳局長指派局中、職員十餘人、組織設計委員會、先行設計、現已將計劃草擬就緒、呈府核示矣、</p>
<h3>勘定地址</h3>
<p>該項工廠地址、已經勘定、卽在高境廟平民屯、該項房屋、計有</p>
<p>一百三十餘間、由上海地方愶會出資所造、本擬借與戰區災民住居、乃以不適於用、故未有災民往居、爰由市社會局派員前往地方協會商請租用、當蒙該會允借、故已派員接收、但當時曾言明、須六個月中將工廠開辦、否則仍由地方恊會收回、自接收迄今、正在積極籌劃、以便早日開辦云、</p>
<h3>側重手工</h3>
<p>將來該廠側重於手工業、並不用大規模之機器、蓋開辦該項工廠之目的、乃在救濟失業工人、而戰區内之失業工人、大多爲手工業者、如用機器、則必須經過一番訓練、且容納工人之數量不多、而於救濟失業工人之本意、若有所不符者、但將來經濟得較充裕、則當隨時擴充云、</p>

<h3>捐贈醫院經過</h3>
<p>九月間正式完成捐贈手續</p>
<p>醫院建築經費已籌有眉目美國煤油大王洛克凡拉氏、在華所置之本埠勞神父路棒球塲地產、面積一百三十餘畝、價値甚鉅、近應我國立上海醫學院及紅十字醫院之請、允將該地無條件贈與、作爲建築規模偉大之醫院、及醫校校址之用、此議現已漸趨具體化、申時社記者昨特往訪主持該事之海格路紅十字會醫院院長顏福慶博士、詢以該事進行經過、當蒙詳告、茲特分誌如下、</p>
<h3>來滬購地起因</h3>
<p>按美國煤油大王洛克氏、爲著名美國首富、置產極鉅、洛氏生平對於公益及慈善事業、頗爲樂善好施、洛氏並在紐約設立慈善基金保管委員會、由洛氏聘請名士多人、組織董事會、專主持洛氏出資舉辦之一切慈善事宜、内分設醫務敎育等各委員會、分别進行、世界各地均曾受其相當之慈善資助、我國各項敎育醫務等、受其援助者、亦屬不少、醫務方面、如恊和醫院、燕京大學、東吳大學等、均按年受其鉅量現金之津貼、氏於十年前、曾擬在我國上海北平二處、各創設大規模之醫院及醫校各一所、故特在上海預購坐落勞神父路及天文臺路間之地產一百三十餘畝每畝代價七百餘元、俾着手建告造院址、嗣因政治及其他種種情形之變遷、遂告無形停頓、而上項所購地皮、亦應體育恊進會之請、暫借作棒球塲等各種運動塲所之用、</p>
<h3>電請洛氏捐贈</h3>
<p>吳淞國立上海醫學院、因去年一二八事件發生、院舍悉爲砲火所毁、一時校址發生問題、嗣由該院院長頽福慶氏、設法在海格路、紅十字會醫院空地内、臨時建造洋房兩座、暫時維持上課、房舍狹小、不敷應用、且紅十字會醫院、亦因院務發達　、所有病舍病床、及其他急性病設備等、均有非擴充不可之勢、因由顏院長籌及洛氏所有在滬之空地一方、本擬作建造醫院校舍之用、特請其義務捐贈、俾另建造一争性病院、</p>
<p>同時國立上海醫院、亦可在該處建立一較完備之校址、當　共同議决、妥擬各項詳細計劃、年前電請洛氏、請其慨予撥助、洛氏接電後、卽發交兹善基金保　會核辦、經董事會審查後、認爲該地旣作爲辦慈善及敎育之用、卽可　同、</p>
<h3>覆電表示贊同</h3>
<p>當於去年底、由該會敎育醫務組主任　藍格氏（Ａ·Ｇｒｅｇｇ）來華獲查一切、回美時、將視察所得、報告董事會、認爲结果滿意、並於今年五月間電覆、表示原則及計劃完全贊同、惟附有條件二項、（一）須有確定之建　經費、（二）須有規定之經常費、如以上兩項、能有確定辦法、該項地產卽撥給、我方接電後、一面着手進行募捐百萬元、以便進行該項建築、並於最近電覆洛氏、表示所提二項、均已有相當辦法、聞該案再經八九月間董事會討論解决後、卽可正式完成捐贈手續、</p>
<h3>籌募經費情形</h3>
<p>據顏博士語申時社記者、關於洛氏捐贈地產、大致已可得其完全應允、該項地基、共計一百三十餘畝、據工部局方面估價、每畝約一萬八千兩、總計價値、當在四五百萬元之譜、在該地基上、　計劃建築急性病院、曁國立醫學院址一所、建築費决定爲一百萬元、現已募得八十萬元、且已收到四十萬元、餘數在短期内亦有辦法、將來醫院内設　、决定以急性之　治爲主料、床位將擴充爲五百　、各項設備、務求完善、院名大致已决定爲中山醫院、至醫學院部份、建築新址時、對於學額及科别、亦須大加擴充、預計該院每年經常費須五十萬元、除現原有二十萬元、及繼續請求洛氏津貼每年五萬元外、　向我國文化基金委員會、要求津貼、並攪在棒球塲地產内、劃出多餘之地一方、建造民房、將來該處房產收入、對經常費亦不無小補、惟劃地另建民房一節、現尙未徵得洛氏同意、但經我方去電解釋後、大致可不成問題、故對於上項計劃、進行頗爲順利、至開始建築日期、待洛氏基金會正式通過後、大約在本年八九月間、卽可動工建築云、</p>

<h3>最近日本小學敎員之生活問題（二）袁（）影</h3>
<p>更使明瞭起見、將薪金别之敎員數揭示如左</p>
<p>薪金類别男敎員女敎員數</p>
<p>三○元以下三八人四四人三○丨三五一七八一、三七三三五丨四○一、四六九三、五七一四○丨四五三、九八二一二、七五三四五丨五○八、九五六一一、四八三五○丨五五一三、四六六七、四二四五五丨六○一○、八三八四、六八八六○丨六五九、七九九二、六九四六五丨七○八、四○八一、六四八七○丨七五六、八四五一、○四○七五丨八○五、六五四七二一八○丨八五五、○二九四五八八五丨九○四、四二四二二○九○丨九○四、四二四二二○九○丨一○○五、一○六一六一一○○丨一一○三、六一一六九一一○丨一二○二、五二九一一一二○丨一三○一、七五六四一三○丨一四五一、二五三無一四五丨一六○五六○無一六○丨一八○三四四無一八○丨以上三三四無以上根據一九三三年一月刋行之『日本帝國文部省第五十六年報』</p>
<p>上述統計係指初等科正敎員、而比正敎員薪金更少的代用敎員、准敎員、專科敎員等尙不在内又上述係官　統計而是一九二八年調查者、所以師範畢業生之初任薪都市男的四五元、少的四○元、地方男的四○元女　的三五元、但自去年起已减低百分之五乃至十、現在初任薪的在三五元至四五元之間、故比之上述統計當又有减少、</p>
<p>如統計所示、我人可以明白男女通計以四○元至六五元爲最多數、卽以此四○元至六五元的　藱金維持生活的　敎員、占全部百分之六七、而在一○○元收入以下者爲百分之九二、百元以上卽有、亦未能超過一四五元</p>
<p>除此薪金之外、尙有加俸、住宅費、賞金等、加俸大體須有續勤五年以上而由校長和　祝學推奬、每年加二四元至四八元、十年以上加四八元至七二元、十五年以上加七二元至九五元（以上是本科正敎員）以及在僻陬地方（年三六元以下或單級學校（年六○元以下）之特别加偰俸、但此</p>
<p>種加俸並非月薪、故假定取得年功加俸最高額九十五元、而第月平均亦祗、七元九角、</p>
<p>所謂賞金、在東京則半年爲月薪的二成、每年是</p>
<p>一個朋又四成、農村的賞金是每年一次、通常是薪金的一成乃至二成、但其中尙有賞金五角者、卽此種賞金、最近强制取消的　農村亦不少、住宅費在東京的舊市内）目下東京市已大加擴充）校長第月七元、普通四元、非家主是二元、、農村大槪是二元、</p>
<p>日本的小學敎員除每日須担任緊重的功課之外、還須參加靑年會處女會（大多係法西斯蒂化的　團體）等社會敎育的課外勞働、同樣的课外勞働、靑年訓練所每週二日每月二十元、而補習夜校</p>
<p>也是每週二日、但在科敎員爲十七元、專科敎員祗八元而已、</p>
<p>又岩手縣山間一個單級小學的中年敎員曾有如下的感想發表、</p>
<p>『兒童和他們的父母、也有拿蔬菜到敎員住所　來、於是我們就常常期待着他们、這是多麽卑賤的心理、但是孩子又多、生活也實在太困難了、近來此間學校也常有缺食兒童、中飯時女人給些東西他們吃、他們就份外的喜歡、農村生活的</p>
<p>慘苦、己至如此地步！』、</p>
<h3>（三）經費之由來</h3>
<p>原來日本小學敎員之薪金是由國家或地方負担、地方全部負担時、敎員就受地方处自治團體的公務員直接支配、國家負担、由國家機關丨政府、地方廳官吏丨直接支配、小學敎員時隸屬關係原無多大問題、而他们所切望的是薪金的能得保證、</p>
<p>看鄉村方面的歲出、丨一九三三年版之農業年鑑（丨一九三一年度鄉村歲出之百分之四五·七）</p>
<p>六是使用於學校經費、其中敎員薪金占百分之二八·八九（一億三千三百萬元）、但自鄉村財政之源泉時農業發生恐慌、於是卽上述支出、亦發生問題、秋田縣擬經營學校造林、謀作敎育費源泉、但如不動用購置苗木的欵項、就不能解决目前的欠薪問題、所以也是遠水救不到近火、農村旣如此貧困、於是祗有設法由國家負担、</p>
<p>關於敎員薪金之由國庫負担、自一九一八年年制定『義務敎育經費國庫負担法』以來、每年由國庫支出一千萬元、其間至一九二三年起是四千萬元、二六年起七千萬元、二七年起七千五百萬元、三○年起八千五百萬元、去年對貧窮農村又另外臨時支出一千二百萬元、但是現在日本國家財政、亦非量入爲出、是量出而以公債爲入、皍由『金』的財政變質爲『紙』的財政、所以目下的財源、亦是說有就有說無就無的狀態、</p>
<p>而所謂東北事件費、一九三一年是七各二百萬元、一九三二年度是二億五千二百萬元、本年度的預算是一億六千一百萬元、合計有四億八千六百萬元之巨、另外所謂機密費、尙不在内、此種狀態、又不知何時完了、而荒木陸相對本年度的預算尙提出每年一億二百萬元的擴張陸軍設備的三年大計劃、日本軍閥本就不顧民生、而祇謀實現其軍國方義、但是鳩山文相對於敎育經費亦在力爭、或淸軍部大削减軍費、或淸高橋藏相增發公債、且對小學敎員生活保證之求諸國庫亦並不反對、但照目下日本國家財政狀態、小學敎員藱金卽由國家負担、欠薪問題、也是不能完全解决、</p>
<h3>（四）兩種新動向</h3>
<p>日本小學敎員在此種情况之下、反眏出兩種値得注目的動向、一個是左傾另外一種是可以茨城縣作代表的法西斯蒂的傾向、</p>
<p>秋田縣學務部並且樹立取締敎員學生思想的方針、現將規則錄下、</p>
<p>（一）調查敎員學生之思想系統、調製表格存縣、（一）設調查縣内敎員學生之思想情况之視察員、</p>
<p>（一）校内開演以敎員學生爲中心之童話劇及其他劇本以及編輯校友會雜誌等、均須得學校當局之許可、</p>
<p>（一）校長須常向縣府密報敎員及學生之思想動向、有延報及隱匿者受處分、</p>
<p>（一）常開思想等導講演會、對注意人物行個别指導</p>
<p>以茨城代表的其他一個動向卽由斐鄉　師之費鄉會運動所表示的　本主義等的法西斯蒂化、此　動向雖尙屬萌芽、但愛鄉　之中心保小學敎員、血盟團事个件中之有小學敎員參加等事實卽可證明已有相當表現、（完）</p>

<p>最近山東省政府與地方機關，及人民組織山東省國貨推銷委員會，主張以强制推銷國產貨品。凡全省黨政軍機關及服務人員所用貨品，完全以國貨爲限。蓋將樹之風聲，以身創率，養成良好習慣。此種官民合作之强制性推銷國貨，較之僅憑一紙空文貼標語喊口號之提倡國貨，其效力之大，實勝千百萬倍，猶記國民政府成立以還，對於提倡國貨之舉，有會議有公文，有辦法，可謂極重提倡之能事，顧數年以來，絶尠效力。公務人員。，收入較多，生活較高，一切但求舒適暢快，何睱問及所用品物之是否國產。説者謂『政府人員地位愈高，則推銷外貨愈力。』此爲何等痛心之事。甚至明明本地有絶好土產，亦屏而不用，以醉心外貨爲得計，日前余英傑君夫人談及國内有許多國產品，價格較外貨不及二分之一，所差者裝璜與形式耳，苟善爲指導，加以改良，其銷路何致盡爲外貨所奪，其語更有見解，最近山東國貨展覽會之推銷國貨，先從本省土產入手，如博山之料器，烟台之府綢，當先事推廣，分布各地，以擴展推銷之市塲，此種官民合作之精神，大可取則希望各省分别仿效，並由省政府通令各縣政府一體照辦，苟能實心實行，澈底合作，則國貨之發展，極有希望也。</p>

<h3>國貨在靑島</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>靑島爲華北要港，天時地利，兩得其宜。年來地方人士對於國貨的提倡，頗爲致力，如組織國貨公司國貨介紹所等，均爲靑島人士實心提倡國貨之鐵證。本月十日舉行之第四届國貨展覽會，係由靑島市政府社會局聯合上海市商會市民提倡國貨會國貨維持會等，糾集上海各國貨工廠而成。參加之工廠，共一百三十二家，計絲織品十一家，棉織品十家，針織品六家，皮革品十家，橡膠品六家，電料品五家，器具品十家，服飾品十一家，化妝品十二家，飲食品九家，日用品四十家，上海參加者一百零九家北平一家，烟台一家，本市二十一家。會塲有二處：一爲天津路之東萊銀行舊址，即未來之靑島國貨公司商塲，</p>
<p>樓有四層。一爲河南路復聚東貨棧原址，樓有三層，均極寛敞。大會禮堂在第一會塲大院内，莊嚴燦爛，五彩繽紛。十時開會，有致力是會最熱心之沈成章市長，有華北敎育家張伯苓先生，有主辦是會之儲社會局長。先由儲君致開會詞：略謂舉行此會之意義，有二點：一爲介紹民衆之認識，二爲引起工廠自身改善之機會。沈市長之訓詞先謂藉此展覽，旣可致民衆貨，覘其好恶，以期適合需要，供求相應，尤可聯絡農工商各界，使之互相研究，力求進步，俾出品益臻精粹，月異而歲不同。張伯苓先生之演説，很有興趣。他説從事製造國貨，比捐飛機的功用更大。提倡國貨，不是貼標語呼口號所能成功。靑島一市，在三天内有二大集會，一是救貧，一是救弱，都是根本工作，諸位廠商的競爭改進，恍如華北運動會賽跑，吾們消費的，恍如拉拉隊，以助諸位生產家的成功，聽者哄堂。此外上海國貨旅行團代表王介安，靑島國貨公司代表丁敬臣，靑島市商會代表于維庭，均有演説，會畢參觀全塲，佈置雅潔，陳列美化，來賓莫不讚美盡致，而華北運動員到者尤多。據統計股報告第一日全日參觀人數計七萬四千餘人，各廠貨物出售者，總計有一萬八千四百三十五元，實爲靑地空前之盛舉也。</p>

<h3>首都國展會</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>今年係國貨年。故各地所開之國貨展覽會。較前數年特多。已過去者如嘉屬六縣杭州寗波定海溫州等處。正在展覽者。首都與靑島兩處。尙在計畫中者。如汕頭潮梅等處。足徵提倡國貨以救國。自政府以至民衆。莫不同具此心。努力進行。以上各處展覽會。以首都規模最宏大。蓋其他各處。均由當地商會與抗日會等團體所發起。領導前往者。係一國貨團體所屬之會員工廠。不能向全國各地普遍徵求。首都之國貨展覽會。係實業部國貨陳列館所發起。旣由部分咨各省市飭屬選送陳列貨品。復派員分往各地竭力徵求。領導前往之團體。計有上海杭州寗波三國貨工廠聯合會。故全國所有國貨。不論機製與手工。已綱羅殆盡。種數之多。無與論比。大别之。計分皮件。針織。毛織。橡膠。水瓶。棉織。五金。絲織。化學。印染。農業。飲食。以及玻璃琺瑯陶器。鞋帽扇傘。與潔身用具。特種出品等項。分門别類。加以説明。陳列會塲。以供衆覽。開幕時。陳公博部長因有要事。派政務次長郭春濤代表出席。致開會辭時。詳述通商以來。例强抱經濟侵略政策。將所出貨品。向我國推銷。致海關進出口統計上。入超年增。殊覺痛心。并謂本届之展覽會。較前兩次所開者。參加工廠多至一倍。希望下次開會時。較今日更形熱鬧。養成全國民衆均服用國貨以爲榮之心理。言時以手指其所穿之西裝。而曰今日鄙人身上穿有洋貨。自覺慚愧。自今以後。當改良云云。聽衆莫不佩其率眞而鼓掌。陳列館館長彭百勛報告籌備經過情形後。謂當此溽署薰蒸。驕陽肆威之際。各地廠商踴躍參加。各界代表相率蒞會。一種不畏難。不怕熱之愛國心。令人欽佩。感謝不已。本館同人當竭全力於『提倡推銷。鼓勵改進』八字。使國貨逐漸進展。不負國</p>
<p>人之期許。希望全國人士。一致總動員。努力購用國貨。旋由實業部商業司科長馬克强。與滬杭甬國貨廠商代表馬濟生。相繼演説。語皆精警。發人猛省。聽者動容。最後高呼『提倡國貨是拯救危亡的基本工作』。與『要救濟我國失業工人必須提倡國貨』等口號而散會。在澄碧閣用茶點後。導往陳列室與臨時商塲。參觀一週。所有貨品。佈置井然。琳瑯滿目。美不勝收。誠盛舉也。歸而爲記。以留鴻爪。</p>

<h3>獨覇天南的國貨手帕廠</h3>
<p>— 周玲</p>
<p>中國自從門户開放，和外國通商以來，海外一切物品，都集中於我國市塲，所以商戰更加利害了，好的東西，定然得勝，不好的東西，定然失敗，這是一定的道理，可憐我國的工業，沒有長足的進展，舶來的貨品，逐年多起來，大家都喜歡購買，人民的生活，因此日漸困苦，近幾年來，我國有學識的人，利用機器工業的原理，紛紛設立工廠，自製貨品，以圖補救，即如手帕一項，雖然很小，然而它的銷行很廣，社會上的士女，每人都少不得備一塊，手帕遂成爲必需的東西，可惜市面上平常所見的，都是從外國來的，一年中被外國人奪去的利益，不可計算，所以有幾位粤商，如馬鰲蕭貴洪，王子嘉，王玉麟，黃欽，諸君，特地於民國二十一年集了資本，在香港九和坊創立華達手帕製造有限公司，工廠中置備新式機器，專製各種手帕，並且經過中英菲等政府註册，以三羊牌爲商標，原料的配選，營業的推廣、全用科學方法辦理，出品旣良好，因此銷行日見擴大，現在計算銷到的地方，國内是華北華南，國外是南洋羣島，貨品雖然趕快的製造，但還不夠分配，二十一年份雖祇營業四個月，　然而得到的利益也不少了。</p>
<p>茲將該廠優點，約略記述，以資借鏡：</p>
<p>（一）關於組織管理方面：該廠設立總務處總其成，加外分出營業部，製造，裝璜，儲貨，設計，宣傳，會計，收發，文牘，庶務，等九股，實行分工合作的精神。</p>
<p>（二）關於出品方面：該廠以時代化爲目標，譬如裝璜的美觀，花樣的新奇等，天天在改良，以合現代的潮流。</p>
<p>（三）關於研究和改善方面：該廠規定每星期六晚上，召集各股職員叙會，對於工作應怎樣改良，各人都可發表意見，擇尤採用。</p>
<p>（四）關於營業方面：該廠用新式的招徠方法，推銷貨品，所以銷行中外，『三羊牌』三個字，實在已經深印在中國人的腦海中，久已得到社會人士的認識了</p>
<h3>國貨金鷄皂精之功効</h3>
<p>年來外貨大肆傾銷，影響我民生問題殊大，僅以肥皂用品一項而論，每年漏巵何祗千百萬，揆其根源，大半因國貨皂類，或因定價過昻，　或因功効低微：或因氣味惡劣：於是舶來品得以横行無忌。現有實業界巨子劉鶴卿徐春帆等諸氏大發宏願，重金廣聘化學專家，蒐集各種肥皂原料，用科學方法，經十數次之精究，始發明功効驚人之金鷄牌皂精，聞凡用過皂精用戶，無不一致讚美，谓其去垢力强，不損織物，殺菌消毒，氣味芬芳，用法簡單，不費手續，定價低廉，適合平民、勝過一切肥皂皂粉，誠國貨年中之好消息也。</p>
<h3>提倡國貨飲料</h3>
<p>— 一鴻</p>
<p>朋友送來幾瓶洋貨鮮橘水，　我吃着忽然發生了『利權外溢』的感想，我魏慚愧！</p>
<p>在夏天，人是時時都要進飲品的，不過喝了不潔的飲料，就有患霍亂病的危險，如果喝洋貨汽水鮮橘水，又多給外國人盡一些義務！</p>
<p>五洲藥房製有各種新鮮菓子露，原料是用上等水菓，再經過消毒的手續，做成的，計有檸檬，雪梨，蘋菓，葡萄，楊梅等十幾種，味美可口，止渴生津，經濟衛生，一舉兩得，這是値得提倡的國貨飲料。</p>
<h3>對話</h3>
<p>— 施樹禮</p>
<p>前日，甲乙兩人在客室裏閒談。甲説：『時間過得眞快，不覺又臨到炎熱的夏天了，而過夏的衣服，以及一切用品等還沒有備好，我想，最近要到外商ⅩⅩ公司買點夏令用品去，你去嗎？</p>
<p>乙説：『什麽，你還不知道我國爲什麽弄到這樣貧窮呢，都是爲了國人不愛用國貨，而用洋貨，你還想買洋貨去嗎，可惡，眞可惡。</p>
<p>甲説：『那麽，你以爲怎樣？』</p>
<p>乙説：『我以爲一切的用品，都要用國貨，旣可免除利權外溢的弊病，還可以使國家富强。</p>
<p>甲説：『國貨不及洋貨那樣好。』</p>
<p>乙説『誰説洋貨好，洋貨會吸我們的汗血，滅亡我們的國家，國貨眞好，旣美麗，又堅牢。』</p>
<p>甲説：『唔丨知道了，我以後决不買洋貨，到中國國貨公司中去買國貨了，·······』</p>

<h3>妬婦殺妾案</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>（一，迷信孟子的楊少修）</p>
<p>楊少修，是廣東鉅頭陳濟棠部下的紅人，他的職務，是接近這位陳副官處内務股長。他自從得了陳鉅頭的信任，做了數一數二的紅人，『紅人自有黃金屋。紅人自有顏如玉，』他旣在某石街建築了歲座洋樓，黃金屋是有的了：有了黃金屋少不得要藏着幾個顏如玉。他的渾家黃氏是著名的母大蟲，且又不美，不配説顏如玉：若要顏如玉，須得結交幾位異性的女友。好在楊少修是和藹可親的，和那些交際之花女學生做</p>
<p>朋友，不擺架子，不鬧脾氣，便得了一般顏如玉的激賞，很有幾個想到黃金屋中去和楊少修做一對兒。天之驕子楊少修，紅到極點了，但是紅得和燒旺的炭團一般，『十分紅處已成灰，』只不過一眨眼的工夫，紅人兒倒起霉來了，『霉頭搠到印度國』了。</p>
<p>楊少修怎樣搠霉頭呢？他過於迷信孟子了。孟子形容富貴人，道了一句『宫室之美，』便繼續一句『妻妾之奉，』楊少修造了洋房，要娶美妾，便是仿照孟子所説的步驟。再者，楊氏有了金子房子，還缺着兒子，孟子又有兩句奬勵納妾的話，呌做：『不孝有三，無後爲大。』楊少修的納妾，除却他老婆，誰都不能説他不是的。他的老子，尤其贊成兒子的納妾計畫，只爲兒子納妾，老人便有抱孫的希望。楊是廣西欽州人，楊在廣州做官，老人仍住在欽州鄉間，傳説兒子己經納妾，老人便寫了一封信，寄往廣州道：『聞得兒最近所賞識之女生陳某，性情身體均佳，就以渠爲妾，尤屬便利。』唉！不識相的楊老頭兒，滔天巨禍，都發生在這一紙家書裏面。　怎樣的發生巨禍？第二篇中自有分曉。</p>
<p>懂得不動是沒有生存的權利的。</p>
<h3>萬人爭説五星明</h3>
<p>— 盦</p>
<p>阿桃説是天太熱了要想去買冰吃阿李説是天太熱了，要想去買冰淇淋吃，阿梅説是天太熱了，要想去買西瓜吃，阿蘋説是天太熱了，要想去買汽水吃·····我們這位吳先生和他的夫人張女士，出品了這許多男男女女，不説零話，大約有十幾位，這一門小將，也得將一個家庭，吵得六神無主。</p>
<p>在這樣的溽暑，炎熱蒸人，彷彿燻炙，無怪吳先生的小弟弟小妹妹，大家要呌着天熱，以謀怎樣解暑的方法了，吳先生是很愛他子女的，他們大家呌着熱，他當然要想法子來解决，他很緩和地對他的子女們説：</p>
<p>『我的乖寳寳，停會兒，太陽下了山，熱氣减一些，我同你们到一個地方去，包你不會呌熱，現在且暫息一下吧！』</p>
<p>天空中忽然發現了五顆光明燦爛的大星，在那上下左右的跳舞，同時忽然發現了一個大酒瓶、瓶嘴裏如泉湧般噴出了好似甘泉的汁液，吳先生和張女士欣喜極了，連忙把帶來的籐篋打開，取出了一打半的玻璃杯，給他们子女説：『快些支承受甘泉，喝了下去，包你暑氣全消，凉爽頓生，而且有益衛生呢！』許多孩子，果然照辦，喝一個暢快，大家不約而同的讚道：</p>
<p>『果然好，』同時遊園的大衆，手裏多了一瓶：『北平五星啤洒』。</p>
<p>那晚空中的五星却還十分光明的照耀着。</p>
<h3>盲舞</h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>爲了華的邀約，我踏進了久已絶足的舞塲了。</p>
<p>雖然這舞塲是建設在露天的花園裏但却給夜的氛圍籠罩着，塲中只看見一些黑的影子在閃動，音樂師奏出混濁的曲子，加着嘈雜的人聲，華雖然極力的讚美着這是一個消暑的腾地，但我知道華是因爲要引起我的興趣才這樣説的。實際上這塲所不但不能引起我的興趣。反足給我煩惱的心靈上更添些煩惱而已我們不能忍耐長時間的沉寂，於是我們下意識的走到塲中去跳舞了，黑暗中</p>
<p>我從一個座位上招出一個舞女，因爲病後和久已不舞的關係吧，我的身軀就像要傾跌下去，當我同那舞女不自然的跳到有燈光地方的時候，我忽然瞥見了那舞女的尊容，咦！怎麽伊的一目已經盲了呢？我奇怪！但我的心情立刻又恢復了原狀，我想起了報上載過的廣東瞽妓，她們從小被買了去，等到成年的時候，就被買者弄瞎了伊們的雙目，使伊們在不辨皂白中任意出賣伊們的肉體，···</p>
<p>···這一類的故事，盛行在這悲慘的時代。現在和我跳舞的一目已盲的無女。以及一切目雖未盲實等於盲的舞女，伊們爲生活壓迫着，伊們沒有靈魂，沒有自由，伊們都是這世間最可憫的人呀！這萬惡的社會制度！······我想着，我的頭腦像要爆裂似的，在這時候樂聲驟然停止了。</p>
<p>我和華回到原來的座位上。華剛才是同一位短胖的舞女蹣跚的無着，我問他跳得怎樣？他只是苦笑。我感覺到他是和我一樣的嘗到辣味！</p>
<p>音樂還是在混濁的響奏着，人影還是在黑暗中閃動着，　我不願再接近我們盲目的舞女，我走出濁氣包圍的舞塲了。</p>
<h3>早晨的動</h3>
<p>— 左匀</p>
<p>有一天因爲我要認識這都市的早晨。是什麽樣的形態，所以當金雞初鳴的時候就帶着惺忪的睡眼，走到十字街頭。</p>
<p>那時東方纔微微的現着魚肚色，街燈在這曉色中顯示了畏縮和衰老的神氣，適間的威嚴不知退隱到何處去了。有時急駛而過的汽車。載着舞後賭罷的倦容三三兩兩男男女女的依偎着在奔向他們的歸宿。</p>
<p>在這夜已過去，早晨將代替着流動的時候，一切的響聲從四面集攏來，好像告訴濃睡的人們，又是勞動的時間了。最先開始動的是由郊外挑着重担走向市塲的菜販。他們喘着氣，哼着勞動者特有的調子：『杭唷·····杭唷······』從遠遠的地方傳來：一聲連一聲，在淸澈的寂靜的空氣中迥盪着，好像是歌頌天明的音樂：也好像咒詛人生的悲鳴。他們趕着趕着，一切的希望在前程等着，同時這呼聲也就是促進前程光明的利器。</p>
<p>接着就是許多鐵輪在每一個衖堂裏的水門汀上『轟轟轟·····』的響起來，那又是『倒老爺』的動了。他們的歌聲是嘹喨激越的：『起來····』『倒·····』響遍了遠近。一個個懷着厭惡心情的人們起身了，嘩的開了後門，『通·····通』馬桶落地的響聲，顯見得人們都有了生氣了。</p>
<p>但是還不會安靜，一切要動的人，也都動起來了。馬路上的人漸漸的多着，　大衆可乘的車子，也從鐵軌上拖來，車</p>
<p>肚裏擠得黑黯黯的，盡是着短衣的工人，向各個塲所去趕他們的麵包。『申報，新聞報·····』遍地的喊起來，在烟燈旁薰得黑黝黝的老槍們，呌得尤爲起勁這是動的形態是普遍了，一切人們都有他動的目標，怱怱的迫切的，好像都</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十二回　　寒賤苦從戎病夫落伍</p>
<p>犧牲甘解甲戰士多情</p>
<p>這個日子，依然是夜晚很長，趙自强走到樓窗邊一望，就看到天色依然是銀灰的，星星是稀了，幾個如杯口大的亮星，好像是小電燈泡，在半空裏很孤零的向下沉着。　那郊外的寒風，　在早上它是更有力量。尤如帶着稀薄的鋒口，向人臉上刮着，趙自强看了天色，在寒氣中打了兩個呵欠，心裏正想着，當兵的人，實在太苦，這樣早就起來，呌那年輕的姑娘，嫁給軍人····趙得全，有。劉進升，有！一種點名的粗暴短促聲，由寒氣裏傳了過來。他又想了，我不要不知足了，當連長的人，從從容容起床，從從容容穿衣穿鞋，洗臉漱口，太自由了。可是他們士兵呢？軍號一嚮，第一個是班長骨碌跳了起來，十分鐘之内，連床舖都要整理好了，然後到院子裏集中站隊，聽候點名。這十分鐘的工夫，在我只是由床面前走到窗口來罷了。裏腿是不曾打，摸摸衣服，領下的紐扣，也不曾扣着。都是人，這也就可以滿足了。他想到這裏，心矌神怡起來，把服裝整理好了。也就到了七點鐘，這就上操了。這時，天上的星星沒有了，然而天空也只有一點微微的亮，昨晚上的宿霧，兀自籠罩着全操場未曾全收，平常中產之家的人在這樣的寒天出來在皮袍子之外，　縱然不穿一件大衣，也要捲上一條圍巾。可是大兵們怎麽樣呢？只是上身穿一件破皮襖，下身一條棉褲。皮襖大半掉了毛，那還罷了。不堪的就是棉褲。那裏面的棉絮差不多總是舊棉絮重彈的，這那能夠有什麽暖氣。（一四○）</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>家庭簡單去漬法</h3>
<p>— 楚</p>
<p>家庭日常用品，沾染汚漬，應有相當的知識，現在把親自實騐的數種去漬法，介紹如下：</p>
<p>没類</p>
<p>不論機械用，食物用，妝用等各種油類，其汚染的主成分是混合於油中的不乾燥性的油質，要把這油漬刷去，先用肥皂水洗滌，再用軋士林擦之，油漬自然可以退去，倘若是綢緞衣服，不便用肥皂水洗灈，那可買些鹿角霜或炭酸鍈，敷在漬上，上蓋一張吸水紙，用重物壓之，約過了一晝夜，那油漬，就能完全吸出了。</p>
<p>墨水</p>
<p>墨水中含有色素與鐵分，須用蓚酸以去鐵分，再用漂白粉以去色素，倘若經時已久，可用阿姆尼亞水先洗，再用火酒擦之，然後浸在水中漂出。</p>
<p>墨汁</p>
<p>墨汁中亦含有顏料，可先用温肥皂水洗濯，再用飯粒，粘在漬上，入水　之。</p>
<p>血液</p>
<p>血液中含有蛋白質與色素，先用温肥皂水洗去色素，再用半夏擦之。</p>
<p>果汁</p>
<p>果汁中含有糖分與酸分，先用阿姆尼亞水，去其酸分，再用温水洗去糖分</p>
<p>鐵銹</p>
<p>鐵銹中祗有鐵質，用蓚酸或醋酸洗濯卽去。，</p>
<p>漆</p>
<p>漆中含有乾燥性油質與顏料，用麻油先擦，再用揮發油揩拭，然後用肥皂水洗滌。</p>
<h3>夏季各種洗浴的水</h3>
<p>— 楚</p>
<p>我們到了夏季，身體上各種毛病，也隨時要發生了，每日除了飲食物衛生，住宅衛生外，對於洗浴方面，尤須特别注意，可是普通人祇曉得用藥水肥皂，而不知道那一種病，應當用那種藥治療的。現在把我國藥草中最有效騐的。來介紹一下：</p>
<p>皮膚病的桃葉水</p>
<p>用晒乾的桃葉二三兩開水煎濃，每天洗一二次、那末，患頭屑，疹疱，　癬瘡，田虫，脚趾濕癢，痔瘡疔毒等病，都很有效的，洗時水的温度不宜過冷，愈熱愈好，先用布漏去桃葉渣滓。</p>
<p>神經痛的菖蒲水</p>
<p>在水邊繁殖的菖蒲，其根可做强壯劑，若有目疾的人，煎服很靈，如把連根帶葉的晒乾，用二三株，加以皂莢一撮，金剛拳葉四五片，混合煎濃，用布漏出的水，每日洗一二次，大凡有神經痛與僂麻結斯病的人，非常有效。</p>
<p>妊娠時的茴香水</p>
<p>茴香的　子，醫生多用作健胃驅風的藥，因其有特異的芳香性，倘若把茴香的葉晒乾，用水煎汁，對於懷孕的婦人，與怕寒</p>
<p>的身體，常常洗浴，非常適家，而且因鼻空口腔：受茴香氣的薰蒸，精神亦感快爽。</p>
<p>肝痛的當歸水</p>
<p>當歸爲婦人補血的主要藥，香氣强烈，大凡有胃病，肝氣病膽石痛，婦女白帶等，用當歸三四錢，川芎，茴香，枝皮各二三錢，加水兩碗煎汁，洗浴，旣可鎭痛，又能驅風。</p>
<p>百病都靈的百草水</p>
<p>就是藥让裏收拾各種藥草時，剩下來的藥屑，如有皮膚病，婦人病，胃腸病，痔瘡等，用以洗浴，非常有效。</p>
<p>去濕止癢的桑葉水</p>
<p>用桑葉晒乾，藥肆中所售的冬桑葉，加以明礬一塊，黃柏，花椒稀簽草二三錢，用水煎洗，可以治療慢性去濕止癢的濕疹，殺菌消毒，爲效甚大。</p>

<h3>『推』的餘談</h3>
<p>— 豐之餘</p>
<p>看過了『第三種人的推』，使我有所感：的確，現在『推』的工作已經加緊，範圍也擴大了。三十年前，我也常坐長江輪船的統艙，却還沒有這樣的『推』得起勁。</p>
<p>那時候，船票自然是要買的，但無所謂『買舖位』。買的時候也有，然而是另外一回事。假如你怕沒有舖位，一早帶着行李下船去罷，統艙裏全是空舖，祗有三五個人們。但要將行李擱下空舖去，可就窒碍難行了。這裏一條扁担，那裏一束繩子，這邊一捲破席，那邊一件背心，人們中就跑出一個人來説，這位置是他所佔有的。但其時可以開會議，崇和平，買他下來，最高的價値大抵是八角。假如你是一位戰鬥的英雄，可就容易對付了，只要一聲不響，坐在左近，待到銅鑼一響，輪船將開，這些地盤主義者便抓了扁担破席之類，一溜烟都逃到岸上去，抛下了賣剩的空舖，一任你悠悠然擱上行李，打開睡覺了。倘或人浮於舖，沒法容納，我們就睡在舖旁，船尾『第三種人』是不來『推』你的。只有歇在房艙門外的人們，當賬房查票時却須到統艙裏去避一避。</p>
<p>至於沒有買票的人物，那是要被『推』無疑的。手續是沒收物品之後，弔在桅杆或什麽柱子上，作要打之狀，但據我的目擊，眞打的時候是極少的，這樣的到了最近的碼頭，便把他『推』上去。據茶房説，也可以『推』入貨艙，運回他下船的原處，但他們不想這麽做，因爲『推』上最近的碼頭，他究竟走了一個碼頭，一個一個的『推』過去，雖然吃些苦，後來也就到了目的地了。</p>
<p>古之『第三種人』好像比現在的仁善一些似的</p>
<p>生活的迫壓，令人煩寃，胡塗中看不淸寃家，便以爲家人路人，在阻碍了他的路，於是乎『推』。這不但是保存自已，而且是憎惡别人了，這類人物一闊氣，出來的時候是要『淸道』的。</p>
<p>我並非眷戀過去，不過説，現在『推』的工作已經加緊，範圍也擴大了罷了。但願未來的闊人，不至於把我『推』上『反動』的碼頭去，丨則幸甚矣。</p>
<h3>一個小學敎師的意見</h3>
<p>— 沈士元</p>
<p>十年前抱了『敎育救國』的夢想，曾經謝絶了親友們的援引，不經商，不幹『奉此等因』的把戲，埋頭在小學敎育。當時何嘗不以爲敎育是『神聖事業』，兩三年後方知並不是那麽一回事。小學敎師在地方官和紳士眼裏看來差不多就等於要飯的呌化子、</p>
<p>可是我仗著有些薄產，不靠一二十元的薪水養家，學欵儘管拖欠，我還是幹我的黑板粉筆生活。我以爲只要敎者熱心，讀者有益，那麽，即使人視我爲呌化子而我的事業依然是『神聖的。』</p>
<p>直到最近，我方始覺悟到我是完全失敗了。最大的原因是我所採用的敎本就好像是約齊了來嘲笑我的『理想』的。</p>
<p>姑舉國語課本爲例。幾家大書店的國語課本，我都用過。我記得常常敎到這麽一隻故事：某人幼貧，克勤克儉，後來就發了財，生活很安樂。敎人家勤儉，原是極應該的，但是終之以發財而生活安樂，就好像勤儉的惟一目的只是錢，這對於兒童們思想上的影響恐怕未必好罷？而我敎到這樣的一課時，尤覺若芒刺在背，不能自安。爲什麽呢？因爲我旣勤亦儉，然而我不想發財，我反而拿不到薪水，自己情願賠錢幹，因爲我認爲人生目的尙有大於致富者。如果我是對的，那麽敎科書的編者爲什麽要那樣説？我於是乎非常惶惑而且憤慨。其次，我是個老實人，不喜歡油嘴滑舌：而且我看到我親戚家裏的帮閒食客都是油嘴滑舌之流，我也恨油嘴滑舌。不幸我在敎本裏又常常遇到『笑林廣記』式的油嘴滑舌的短篇。並且兒童們很快就學會了這一套，口舌敏給也許是所謂『多才多藝』者之一藝一才，但是把小小的天眞的兒童敎會了市井式的油嘴滑舌恐怕未必合於敎育目的罷？爲什麽敎科書的編者喜歡那樣的敎材？這又使我大惑不解。</p>
<p>復次，我不反對貓哥哥狗弟弟的故事。但是我相信兒童的智慧發達到某一階段後就不應該專拿貓哥哥狗弟弟的故事給他們讀。不幸有些敎本全套八册一直是貓哥哥狗弟弟到底：不過頭上幾册是小貓小狗（就是故事簡單）而後幾册則是頭腦複雜些的貓狗罷了。我每逢敎到這些，便不禁要疑心這些敎本是特地編給貓哥哥狗弟弟讀的。</p>
<p>我懷抱了這些疑惑，一向總沒有個請敎處，現在看見好幾位先生説要批評敎科書並且還希望小學敎師來發表意見，雖然我從今年起已經不是小學敎員了，但是我這一點意見也許可作參考，所以就大胆寫了出來。</p>
<h3>女主人與小犬</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>去年國難會議開幕時，曾經演過要求</p>
<p>取消當治的喜劇，結果是由某先生的兩下乾脆的鑼鼓，悠然收塲：『黨治的取消，祇有二條路，第一是由國民自動取消，第二是民衆革命』</p>
<p>到現在，又有人提起『開放政權』的話來了，這比『取消黨治』，確已溫和得多，所以同是那位先生，就不待民衆革命，發表過有開放之意的談話了。</p>
<p>但我想····丨喔！寫到這裏，方纔知道我已干了禁例。自由談的編者是曾經勸人『多談風月』的，我怎麽又談起國事來了呢？該死！趕快轉舵，但苦我並不『風用情濃』，那麽，説一個小小的故事罷：</p>
<p>一女主人有一小鑰，用以啓一小廚。廚中有一小瓶，瓶中有糖霜一小塊。女主人有一小犬，犬性甚好弄，喜攫女主人裙而牽曳之。</p>
<p>女主人取小鑰，。啓其小廚，於小瓶中取糖霜小塊出。小犬仰視而搖其尾。女主人曰：『加普利薩，彼得羅夫那汝曳我裙裾，今看此糖塊，但汝不得食之』</p>
<p>女主人仍以糖塊置原處。小犬悔恨然而晚矣。（域外小説集面一七七）</p>
<p>這個故事的作者，梭羅古勃，是俄國的小説家，不是中國的諷刺家，這是應該聲明的。</p>
<h3>我也談談所謂（『四庫珍本』</h3>
<p>— 無咎</p>
<p>前幾天自由談上王和先生所發表的關於所謂『四庫珍本』的意見，通達得很，但他的眼光略嫌限於文化圈内，未曾注意到『四庫珍本』將是一種商品，看穿他在文化的立塲上所不以爲然的却是將來一本萬利的發財的大關鍵，未免有些美中不足。</p>
<p>據我看來，書店的影印『四庫珍本』完全是『商業性質』的。一切的一切都爲這『商業性質』所决定。假如理解這性質，則王和先生所以爲和文化性質不合的將都可以洞達其一貫性和奥妙性，而他所希望的將選目公開，由學者來討論决定的高議，也可不必再存妄想，想它能夠實現。</p>
<p>例如王和先生以爲由中央圖書館籌備處長蔣復聰那樣沒有常識的人來選擇所謂『四庫珍本』的目錄，有點侮辱當代學者。但從商業的立塲上看來，所謂學者却不及中央圖書館籌備處長可以號召。又王和先生以爲藏書家未必有學問，不應該去問他們的意見，却該問學者的意見如何。但從商業的立塲上看來，却不及去問藏書家意見，因爲去問他們的意見無異去問大主顧。至於所謂居徒壁立的飽學者，王和先生或許以爲他們値錢，　但在做生意的人的眼光裏是不値一文的，他又不會出着高價買書去藏。再如所謂『溝通國際文化』，王和先生似乎以爲説得太誇大，但從商業上看來，又該誇大纔　其爲廣告。並且我們若從商業上去推詳，也便可以推詳出所謂『四庫珍本者將是一種什麽東西。</p>
<p>那將是這樣的：印得精雅，藏書家看了很愛的：價錢賣得很高，藏書家可誇爲只有他幾家有收藏，一般人看不見的：因此條件，又須不能拆賣，可以滿足藏書家獨有的興味。</p>
<p>至於我們一班窮小子假如想讀書，那還是要像現在這樣老老實實地跑到藏有『四庫全書』的圖書館去抄去。</p>
<h3>平凡的事（二四）</h3>
<p>— 𣽃果孫</p>
<p>這組長的意思，以爲之光的目的固然在乎去乍長興的泥工並不完全留在劉家宅，也許從劉家宅以北直到江灣楊行一帶隨地皆有，那未又何必定要到劉家宅呢！倘若從這裏的小路抄到大塲，再由大場向東對江灣一帶走，那末危險就减少了，只在橫斷中山路而行的那一會兒了；况且走到那裏的時候，也許已經不要一點鏡就會天黑，天一黑就格外來得安全。</p>
<p>於是之光就容納了組長的意見，决計等到打過了三點再動身，這樣，慢慢地抄到大場恰巧天黑</p>
<p>然而不到半點鐘，新的局面又打開了：陳家浜的工頭接到了組長傳來的命令：『四點鐘造飯，五點鐘檢齊己成的材料，預備全班出發。』而之光個人，也接到這位組長的信，他勸他今天不要向北走，又不要東走：項好是到明天再看情形，因爲情形特别嚴重，現在軍隊裏正連夜全班築北面靠東那一帶的陣地······末了，他也提起『運輪的困難情形。』</p>
<p>所謂『全班，』就是説那些不値夜班的人也要做事，當然情形是陡然緊張了，原因大槪就是夜裡必有惡戰：於是之光也陡然感到新的困難：他以爲若是不去看那些泥工，精神上很感不安，若是去看，非再等候一整天不可，然而對於接濟那件事，至少又因而多躭誤了一天！未了，經過了好些次的推敲，他才依照那幾個代表的主張、卽時一同趕回上海去找姚伯唐，設法呌接濟的事實迅速地並且充分地實現。</p>
<p>他們的歸途，　是由陳家浜西南方面的小路，斜斜地跨過鐵路再轉入中山路的、他们們再在中山路上小心謹愼地向南走了三四里之遙，就達到了曹家渡新大橋的南堍。這時候，那些守住租界棚口的意大利水兵，正在黃错之中一心等候他們兵頭的那道關閉棚口的口令。之光悽惻地向那幾個代表説：</p>
<p>『在租界裡，我們也許是今天幾個從新大橋上的最後闖入者！』</p>
<p>這一天四點鐘以後，姚伯唐己經把同行各家對於接濟閘北的意見，歸納而成一個結論，這結論就是：『暫行敷衍，徐圖應付；』換句話就是無論贊助和反對都是取消極態度的，本來這些腆着大肚子撑着老臉皮嘩喇嘩喇説話的阿拉式的一切關於民族前途的問題，幾乎總是抱這樣一種態度，然而伯唐却又不完全是這樣的。以他的性情而論，他原是一個未忘禮義的世家子，以他的學問而論，他確是一個認識時代的工程師，以他的資產而論，他又是一個半就中落而急圖復興的『布爾若瓦』，這樣三個原子的综合，就造成了我們在現實之下看見的那個新式企業家姚伯唐；當然他對於上海一般阿拉式的企業家的意見，素來是不肯完全贊同的，而况乎這次接濟閘北是有關於身家和民族的呢！在伯唐的意識裡，身家固然占了重要的位置，可是對於民族他也並不肯抛開，不幸這兩方面的利益，每每是互相衝突的，所以當他從結論裡面明白了同行那些人的消極主張，認爲是太不高妙，所以就抱着滿肚皮的考慮，來設法調解自己心頭上的矛盾來規劃一個高妙的主張。這眞是値得考慮的！然而在沒有接到代表們的具體條件以前，那末種種主張、都不免是無的放矢，所以他末了只有靜候的一個辦法。</p>
<p>在进展燈剛明的時候，之光就領着那三個代表來了。這三個代表先向伯唐提起他們當初的希望，接着就述及他們這一天在閘北所經歴的情形，然後聲明他們以爲接濟卡車比甚麽都好因此希望廠裡儘量接濟卡車，末了他們又向伯唐説</p>

<h3>冬菰的姊妹丨蔴菰</h3>
<p>蔴菇和香　冬菰，同屬　類植物。但不似香　冬菇，隨處可種。形體也有不同。蔴菰色白，　傘厚而較小，　柄肥而粗大，且無芬芳之氣。但味絶鮮美比香　冬菰，尤勝過之，</p>
<p>蔴菰產於東北幾省、其中以吉林產品最佳。吉林貨中，尤以產於　古塔相近者，貨身最高。察省多倫之喇嘛廟所產亦佳，　八旗貨較次，外八旗產又次之其檔次名目，約略區分之。可得（一）廟大自生，隻隻揀選，色光白凈：質質２肥體厚。（二）裏大自生：色光白亮：隻形均匀。（三）大自生；爲外八旗貨，較次。（四）淨口丁；（五）北口，大自生以下，貨身較次，色光黯黑，隻形參差。所以頂好蔴菰應具備的優點，是（一）色光白亮而純凈；（二）隻形圓整匀落；（三）體積豐蒲肥厚；（四）</p>
<p>身份乾燥。反之便是所謂次貨了</p>
<p>蔴菰自產地裝蔴袋。用駱駝背駄至張家口集中；再在張家口，改裝木箱，嚴</p>
<p>密封固，轉運各地銷售。木箱作方形，每箱約重四五十斤。</p>
<p>蔴菰是素食中唯一一珍品，當然以那些寺院廟庵，素菜館銷路爲最多。從上海轉運出口的，以川帮去胃最强，因產量不多，而需求却殷。於是頗覺名貴。現市每担價約上檔七百元左右，中檔三四百元。一二年前最昻貴時，曾賣過一千三元以上。這就未免有些貴族化了。蔴菰是我國特產。（日本無之，法國有軍蔴）</p>
<p>菰，僅有聽裝），但自九一八後，東北半壁，淪於異族，國人在嘗這美味的時候，心中作何感想！</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>論女人</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>有人説：女人這東西，不過給男人看看的東西罷了。突然聽來，似乎是言之過火，未名有侮辱女性之嫌，然而仔細吟味，却也不是欺人之談。譬如説，中國人以花來形容女人，西洋人以小鳥來形容女人便是這個意思，説到形容，應該是文學家的事，即如李太白的『芙蓉如面柳如眉』易卜生的『我的小松』</p>
<p>鼠呀』，都是異曲同工的，將楊貴妃和娜拉形容得十分可愛。然而女人們在男人眼中是怎樣的一種『東西』？在這裏己經説得明明白白，還用得着强辯麽？</p>
<p>説句正經話，那未自母權時代以後，女人一直到現在，皆不過男人的盆中花籠中鳥。手工業時代是如此，機械工業時代更是如此。唯一的理由便是她們的生產力薄弱，以及生育的關係，於是男子利用了她們的弱點，奴隸她們，使役她們，一切生活，都敎她仰給於男人。『在家從父，出嫁從夫，夫死從子』，不都是規定她們爲男人的附屬品的界説麽？於是她們得服從他，依順他，侍候他，體貼他，安慰他，愛惜他，戀愛他，諂媚他，以嘴唇去溫存他，以大腿去滿足他，爲他傳宗接代，爲他敎育子女。因此他們得面容嬌媚。因此她們在生時有着飯吃和衣穿，在死時也有棺材和衾槨。原來女人便是這樣的『東西』。加之私有社會制度將她壓成了各種各樣的形式，以致她們有了太太，師母，小姐，姑娘，娘姨，大姐，女工，妓女之分。他們是私產，她們也是商品。特别是在這國難年頭，女人更是多難之秋。有許多人都責備女人愛奢侈，不節約，最大的罪狀是不肯光顧國貨。正如某老作家所説；『彷彿女人都進了修道院，國難就會得救似的』。這正如各代的歷史所記載，差不多每一次的亡國，都　與傾國傾城的美女有關。甚而至於『堕馬髻』『愁眉啼裝』都是亡國之兆。其實這並不是沒有了美女天下便會興旺，雖然每一個奸雄或亡國大夫都不免將美女看得和幾萬萬家財一樣重要，但有有多少英雄豪傑並沒有娶得東洋美婦而將東北四省做了妝奩。至於正人君子駡女人是『妖婦』</p>
<p>『敗家精』板起面孔來維持風化，甚至於駡她們不肯一天買兩雙中國絲襪。可是他們在暗淡的燈光之下偷偷的欣賞女人的大腿，以及因她們外國紗羅的遮遮掩掩而引起不可遏止的色慾狂，又何嘗不是這班道學先生國貨君子的惡毒的表現呢？不過是女人旣經受了男人的豢養也就不能不讓他們駡駡罷了。其實這正是她們的可憐處。</p>
<p>上面説了一大篇，也許又有典型男子會駡我是拜倒石榴裙下而甘心替女人辯護。然而自問我的立論至爲公平，事實上假使現社會眞沒有買淫的嫖男，决不會有賣淫的娼女。自太太以至丫頭，都是爲了給男人享樂而生存，而她們所以如此苦惱，千眞萬確的是私有經濟將他們葬下了火坑。那末覺悟而勇敢的女同志們將何以自救呢？除了積極圖謀新天地的創造，大槪是沒有其他辦法的吧</p>

<h3>人生到處是靑山！</h3>
<p>— 雪菴</p>
<p>這是二年前的事了。但是這件事的印象，到現在還深刻地映在我的腦海裏。事實是這樣：</p>
<p>我所服務的工廠裏，當時機械工程方面，缺乏相當的專門技術人才：後來由技師介紹來一個年靑的日本工人，他是初次到中國來，對於中國的人情風俗和習慣，時常流露出一種驚奇而詫異的態度來。在做完了工作的時候，往往獨自一個孤零零地在凝思什麽似的，。</p>
<p>『他一個人飄泊到中國來，在工餘空閒的時候，或是在懷念他的故鄉吧。我這樣想</p>
<p>『朋友，環境的逼迫人眞利害呀，你爲了麵包問題，離開了可愛的故鄉，到生疏的異國來找工作。在空閒的時候。覺得異國生活的枯燥孤寂而懷念你的故鄉嗎？我向他問着。</p>
<p>他聽了我的話，也不回答我，祇微微地笑了一笑；從工服的袋理，取出了鉛筆來，在紙上寫了二十八個字：</p>
<p>『男兒立志出鄉關，事不成就永不還。埋骨何須故鄉地，人生到處是靑山</p>
<p>『人生到處是靑山！』多麽夠玩味的詩句啊。</p>
<p>在我們充滿了濃厚的故鄉觀念的中</p>
<p>國人除了沿海幾省的一部份外，一般的對於向着異地去考察或探求發展生活的舉動，似乎很是少見。他們一部份是靠了祖宗的餘蔭，在故鄉幹『守家當』的工作；還有一部份的人，雖然家無恒產在家鄉過着碌碌生活，但是也被『在家千日好出門一日難』而實行其『貧亦安其身』了。一般人的心理，大都生存着希望在故鄉度過一生的觀念，除非有萬不得己的事，不肯輕易離開故鄉的。</p>
<p>别人組織了什麽考察團，探險家，忍着堅苦的精神，到我們的土地來考察探險，一向抱苟安主義的我們，當然沒有興致去幹這種『阿憨』的工作。别人將我們礦產農產人情風俗都很詳細的調查去了，蒙在鼓裏的我們，當然不知道。（並且是『不屑知道』的丨丨脱胎於『不屑）</p>
<p>爲』）别人用武力將我們的富源搶去了。那也不要緊，本來這些與我們直接不發生什麽關係，就讓他們搶去好了！好在我們有的是『明哲保身』和　『各人自掃門』</p>
<p>前雪』千古不滅的實訓！</p>

<h3>談持志的獨身會</h3>
<p>— 培善</p>
<p>閲報見英國巴金茄姆歇縣之海威科姆市，有靑年百餘名，組織獨身俱樂部一時傳爲創聞，要知靑年之組織獨身團體，我國靑年，早有先例，距今三年</p>
<p>前，江灣持志大學學生，早有獨身會之組織，記者亦爲當日發起人之一，當時參加同學有二百多人，可謂極一時之盛，這會名稱，中文呌做獨身會，英文呌ＢａｃｈｌｏｒＣｌｕｂ，會中組織，有會長，幹事，文書，會計，調查等股：都由大會選舉產生，會中工作，以調查股最忙，因該股擔任調查入會會員，究竟是否爲矌夫，如查己結婚，及有戀人，則必照章開除會　　並須受罰，此會　　　　日深，靑年男子，當以身許國，不應娶妻生子，度甜密性生活，因靑年一有妻室，則成爲暮氣沉沉，未老先衰，同時腐化廢頽等病態，亦因之而生，且只知有家，不知有國，故倡獨身會，俾有志靑年，一心救國，無妻室之累。（二）因生活程度日高，靑年經濟，未能自立，且謀生不易，供養一身，尙虞不敷，又因現代女子，虚榮成性，生活奢侈，不易擔養，再又處此封建式的中國舊家庭制度之下，靑年婚姻，不克自由，受家庭種種束縛，均爲激成靑年獨身主因，亦則當日吾儕組織獨身會原由，完全是時代和社會背景所激成的，</p>
<p>我儕當日這個獨身會主要的人員多半是大學三四年級學生，功課忙碌所以成立以後，會務逐漸不景氣起來了甚至有會員背約　婚及追求女　等事發生於校外，於是被會外同學攻擊　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　相，又説我們會裏的會員，都是失戀以後悔恨女姓的機關，還説是中國靑年人人不結婚，製造小國民，恐怕將來要滅種，沒有爲國報仇雪恥的後人了。這是個嚴重的民族問題。並説我們都是民族的罪人等語，因爲了這個會，我在當日校中的壁報上，和同學們打了不少的筆頭官司，結果雙方都荒廢了許多寳貴的光陰！後來我們這個獨身會也就隨着我們黃金時代學校生活，而無形的幻滅了！當日獨身會的一部份會員、現在有的娶妻生子了！還有一部份、仍是獨身，盛極一時的獨身會，到如今，只留了一個靑春的幻夢，永遠令人回憶着，</p>
<p>最後我介紹我們母校的敎授夏晋麟博士的幾句名言，会爲當日獨身會的閉幕宣言：『靑春的男女們！如果你們覺得結要好，就去結婚，覺得獨身好，就决志獨身，要依照你們個人的生哲學，不要依照你們的好奇心，和學理上得來的觀念。』</p>

<h3>憶舊</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>這還是去年的事實</p>
<p>我和友人劉君從電影院走了出來，已是夜半十一句鐘了。白天的暑熱仍未因夜氣而完全消退，然而凉風習習，却也可人。我們的步履聲在空寂的街心中特别沉重。大部份的五彩電燈都己熄滅只有Ｔｅａｒｏｏｍ或Ｃａｆｅ仍是敞開着，爲了等候着這『神秘之街』所特有的最後的一批『神秘』的人們。這時我鼓勇着對劉君説</p>
<p>『去罷，我們到那Ｃａｆｅ中去喝一杯』</p>
<p>冰結淋去罷，怪口渴的。』</p>
<p>『這我贊成，』劉君馬上接應着説：『可是要到有女招待的　店裏去，爲的要知道那所謂年靑貌美的女招待到底是怎麽一回事。</p>
<p>於是我們便踏進那『白色大菜』的店中去了。</p>
<p>剛一進門，那些白衣的『僕歐』們便吆喝着一聲『客人！』將我們簇擁着上了樓梯，接上是『嘻嘻哈哈！』的少女們連粒　　　領道　我們走進一間『精雅』的　　　　接上是移過屏風。放下簾幔，『好，現在她們總算到手了。』但是我很担心，我得小心的盤算着我的錢，可是不夠，不得不心跳着以日本話問劉君説：</p>
<p>打了一句日本語意思是説『你帶有很多的錢嗎？</p>
<p>他對説『有』於是我放心了，但是我却看見那坐在劉君身上的『女招待』嘻嘻的　對我笑了一陣，接上忸怩的説：</p>
<p>（不要緊喲，你們不都是有錢的嗎？）</p>
<p>『唷？你懂東洋話嗎？』劉君簡直驚愕起來了，我的臉也不禁襲上一陣火熱：丨『啊，我們的秘密結她破獲了。』於是，在她們柔媚的笑聲裏，那位説日本話的姑娘便老實不客氣的代我們做主了。我們是每人一個火腿蛋，他自己也要吃一個加次萊司，除了半打啤酒之外還有一瓶葡萄酒，當然這又是爲她自己打算。那末從此便是吃，喝，談，笑上海話，江北話，東洋話，洋涇浜，擁抱，接吻，還有紙烟，雪茄烟。三小時以後我們走出店門，劉君拭着前額對我説：</p>
<p>『啊！原來這便是上海的女招待，』</p>
<p>我知道了</p>
<p>今年的夏夜，『神秘之街』自然是大不相同了。然而己變到如何的程度呢？我不知道，我的朋友劉君更是不會知道了。</p>

<h3>娶妻與經濟問題</h3>
<p>編輯先生：</p>
<p>吾今年念歲，任某洋行小職員，月入二十餘元，須除去　車等費，所剩無幾。寄歸家用。父亦任事洋行，無產業，所入堪自給。數年前，家人欲爲吾完婚。因吾自知己之學力不足，存意求學，故予拒絶。並曾云云『如無自立能力，决不娶妻！家春莫奈何。茲家母見背，家事照料乏人，家父急欲爲吾完婚，並答吾：『　　父　　　决能爲汝謀一較優之工作。』</p>
<p>於是吾之親事，勢不能再藉辭推延。數日前並已與鄰女某裆初步訂婚，婚期亦不遠。所需費用　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　好容易將數湊滿，現只待婚期之到臨。便吾憂老父年事日高，身體日弱，意料不能爲吾長久依助無疑。設以後吾又時運不濟，營業如舊不展，難繼大志，將來開支日大，無力歸還債，則將來之環境頗堪憂慮。再目前借債娶妻，而吾又有：『不自立，决不娶妻』之言揚於前，此於吾名譽有無損失不利？將否被人談笑？除此有否較妥善之方針？請勿嫌多事，詳爲一答，感甚！黃覺非敬啟</p>
<p>答：『如無自立能力，决不娶妻，』這是現代靑年們的一句頭禪，驟然聽去，未嘗不漂亮而悦耳，可是仔細研究起來，我們就可以發覺其矛盾與不通。『娶妻』本來是很自然不過的事情，只須兩性相愛，隨時可以結合，現在爲什麽要不相干的加上一個『不能自立，　决不···』的　條件呢？大槪説來，其表面原因有：第一，女子經濟不能獨立，必須依靠男子，若男子經濟能力也不能獨立，那末這個家庭就危險極了；第二，女子經濟固不能獨立，男子謀生也非常困難，若男子不能得到一個相當可靠的永久職業，足以自立，而貿然結婚，其前途自屬非常可危。因此兩個原因，故主張男子并有自立能力，不能結婚。然而我要進一步問：女子爲什麽不能獨立？男子的生計問題，爲什麽又至於如此困難呢？假使在另一制度社會之中，私有制度不存在，誰也沒有得失利慾之念，男男女女，都有相當工作可做，都能維持不相上下的一般生活，試問：這一社會中的男女，他們相互結合之時，要不要再問一問男子能不能自立，然後再加上一個『不能自立，决不···』的條件呢？他们當然不要！絶對不要！因爲他們男女之間，生活都能自立，誰也不依傍誰，誰也不會有失業的恐慌，這種事先預防家庭因經濟問題而破裂的經濟條件，他們自然根本不需要！所以説來説去，這一問題，表面是婚姻問題而實質仍是屬於整個的社會問題。此間题旣是整個社會問題，我們要解决她，也就只有從根本着手，若因經濟困難，就不娶妻，這保異對於社會的壓迫，表示屈服？富人可以三妻四妾，我們窮人爲什麽不能娶一妻？所以你説經濟因難，就不娶妻，這是消極的辦法，等於因噎而廢食。而且卽是不娶妻、還是不能解决我們的窮困！我們要以根本的辦法來解决我們的窮苦，單以不娶妻爲消極的抵抗，那完全是錯誤！</p>
<p>譬如：你説經濟不獨立，决不娶妻，我就得問你：你的經濟問題，幾時才能得到獨立？你假使去作壓迫階級的走狗，沾其餘瀝以自肥，或以其他非法方法，掙起一些財產，可以解决這問題外，照你按步就班的做生意下去，無論如何勤儉，做一百年經濟還是不能獨立！豈但不能獨立，照現在狀况看來，若這社會不有變動，恐怕你生活只有一天壤似一天，终必至於一無所有。我問你：是不是等社會變動了，再來娶妻？這當然是不通之論。</p>
<p>所以，我認爲『娶妻』問題，如你認爲需要，不妨就『娶。』至於生活問題，則當另從大處着想，謀根本之解决。而這解决的方法，也决不是怎樣勤儉，怎樣去找一個好職業所能解决的。這還不過是頭痛醫頭脚痛醫脚的辦法。所</p>
<p>謂根本的解决，是要從問題發生之根源　着想。固然，勤儉做事，努力求知，我不是説不要，而且很需要。</p>
<p>其交，來信説父親己籌得千元，這數目就你經濟狀况看來，也似乎用不到，我想一切都　可從省，除必需之費用外，什麽不切實的排塲，應該廢去。男女結合，本來平常，什麽終身大事，都是封建社會騙人的話，你不要相信，該隨便要隨便些。</p>
<p>最後，你説借債『娶妻』，將否被人恥笑？這有什麽關係？假使你自己認爲做事不錯，旁人恥笑，何必去多管？什麽名譽不名譽，也是騙人的話！萬一你至於餓到不能不搶東西吃時，看你還要不要名譽？還有一句話要補充，你來信似有以不得依賴父親以長享安樂爲憾之感，這種障落的意識也是萬萬要不得的！</p>

<p>— 禧林</p>
<p>他無可奈何地在瑪琍飯店的側面走來走去。這並不是想株守三姨太的踪跡祗是借以消磨痛苦的時間。然而却毫無效力，越是走來走去，　越是焦急得像螞蟻旋熱鍋。於是他决定重新走進飯店，厚臉的去問茶房</p>
<p>最會探知笖密的茶房，由石喬的行動上早看穿了他的心底。石喬還只做出一個手勢。他們之中早有人起來告訴他説，三姨太看好房間又出去了，陪來的先生是矮矮的，胖胖的，滿高興的！可不知道什麽時候回來就是。如查石喬要他們告訴房間號碼，祗要給他們好處。他可以開一個房間就在三姨太房間的隔壁。石喬全都答認了他們的條件，他呆坐在那隔壁房間，現在是好奇心超過他的醋意了，到底那矮胖而高興的是什麽人？</p>
<p>不久，忽然有人好像走進自己的房問一樣推開門，石喬探頭一看不是别人是王化，王化顯然有點進退爲難的　樣子丨他是走錯了房間哩丨先無可奈何地乾笑了幾聲，然後走上前握住石喬的手，比平日握得更緊些，他説；</p>
<p>『石喬，哈哈，我居然打住你咧！好極了！我正有事和你商量！哈，哈，哈　！』</p>
<p>『哈，哈，哈，妙極了！石喬强笑起來。他定了一定神將王化的身體遍看了一番，矮矮的，胖胖的，滿高興的。妙極了，哈，哈，哈！</p>
<p>王化素來是個樂觀主義者，他從不固執，認眞。當他曉得石喬揭穿了他的陰私，便也一針見血，却又　不在乎地説：</p>
<p>『你在作一篇愛情的偵探小説呢！石喬，楊太太終歸是楊太太，橫直是人』</p>
<p>家的啊！我看她到底對你好些咧！</p>
<p>這樣一來，石喬一肚子的憤氣倒不好怎樣發作了。但他不得王化的同意，推開房門往隔壁走去，王化笑着跟在後面·他説！</p>
<p>『她還沒有回來呢？也許不一定回來的。今晚陪她的不見祇我一人呀。石喬，我們都被她弄得團團轉咧！』</p>
<p>石喬看見那房裏果然沒有人，起初覺得心裏放鬆了些　祇要王矮子今晚也空等着，這夠他舒服一點，後來想到王矮子説今晚陪她的不見得只他一人那句話　　覺得他一切的醋意，憤氣　　都是多餘的。但素來作事　眞的的他　　不無　　於心</p>

<p>無線電影發達之推測</p>
<p>家置一具亦非不可能</p>
<p>將來所貯藏而待我們去閉發的東西，眞是千變萬化，不可捉摸的。但是這無線的電影泰來維興Ｔｅｌｅｖｉｓｉｏｎ）就是無線電和電影的混合物，是己經與我們相距不遠了。有人説在一九四○年我們就可以家置一具，坐在客廳裏撥動機上的度盤（Ｄｉａｌ）而看得牆上或小型帳幕上的有聲電影了。我們一方面驚奇科學的萬能，一方面自愧無發明的天才，祇可坐在家而享其成了。</p>
<p>我們從看無聲電影到看有聲電影，從玩留聲機器到玩無線電，在這十幾年以來，己經覺另創造了一個世紀。將來無線電影成功，那不是我們又入了一個新時代了嗎？將來的無線電影機，據科學家的傳説，大致將和現在的無線電機差不多，不過屋子内要多設一張帳幕。開映時祗要撥動機上的度盤，聲音從機裏發出來，影子從帳幕上顯出來。同時也可以像現在無線電一樣。可以由電浪長短的支配而隨意揀取（Ｐｉｃｋｕｐ）任何無線電影站所廣播的電影。據美國愛爾西無綫電公司的大衛沙諾甫所預告，將來每個家庭裏都可以有一個小戲院，我們可以隨便看戲，看打拳，看賽馬，看足球，或是聽音樂會。</p>
<p>這無綫電影己經不是什麽新發明了。牠現在雖還在發明家的試騐室中，但己逐漸完成改良，不久，就可見諸實用。據説現在己經可以在兩個小鏡筒裏看見一些在近處傳逹的景物而所發的聲音亦還不下確。將來要將所要傳佈景物的範圍擴大起來，傳聲機加以完備起來，那就可以公諸世界了</p>
<p>至於將來無綫電影廣播的方法，大槪不外兩種。最簡單的就是有聲電影的傳佈。等到將來無綫電影完成了，廣播影戲，是不成問題的。這種方法就是在全世界各地採取重要新聞，造成影片，等到在影戲院裏放映的時候，就可以用泰來維興的方法，向各家庭廣播了。當然平常一切的影片，都　可以用泰來維興廣播的。並且可以利用這個廣播的方法，各家戲院聯合起來，設立一個總廣播電台：從那總電台將電影傳佈到各家影戲院裏去。這樣一來，一個電影拷貝，就可以夠幾百家影戲院的用子。第二種方法，就是從一件事情發生的地方，由特派人員將景物收取了，同時直接廣播到全世界各城各影戲院以及各私人家庭。這係完全和現在廣播一個大集會裏的演説一樣的。</p>
<p>這個消息透了出來之後，許多戲院和影戲院的主人，担起心事來了。他們恐怕將來人人都在家裏用無線電影機（Ｔｅｌｅｖｉｓｏｒ）自己放映電影，而無須到戲院裏去了。但是有許多人相信一大部份人，仍舊喜歡到影戲院而不願意自己坐在家裏自己放映電影的。普通人在家裏登慣了，就覺到無味了：他們到戲院或影戲院，可以遇見許多朋友，可以看見許多人，可以覺得舒適些。戲院裏的空氣和家裏的空氣完全不同的。坐在家裏究竟祇可以看到廣播出來的一部份，而戲院週圍的一切是看不見的。這樣，他們還是要出來的。在這一點上，我亦覺得一種人喜歡坐在家裏的，當然還是坐在家裏；而那一種人，在家裏坐不住的，還是要出來的。不然的話，現在有許多人，家裏有了留聲機器和無綫電，但是他們仍舊要到外面來玩。難道他們將來有了無綫電影機，就不出來了嗎？</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評『紐約一婦人』ＭａｎｄｏｎＢｒｏａｄｗａｙ</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>假如我們也得估定本片之存在價値</p>
<p>，那末男主解羅勃特蒙高茂萊（ＲｏｂｅｒｔＭｏｎｔｇｏｍｏｒｙ）的表演，在那種輕快而熱鬧的情調上，是很値得人們注意的，活潑的動作，敏捷的表情，在其他年輕的美國男角中，很難找着這一同樣的角色。記得似乎在那一個報章上，曾經稱讚他爲美國最得觀衆歡迎的小生。他的表演技巧，的確能投機於高貴的觀衆們的快樂心情，他那明快的動作和説白，可爲他們茶餘酒後的回憶資料。所以蒙高茂萊畢竟是一個得人寵愛的可兒。</p>
<p>除此以外，莎麗嬡鸞絲（ＳａｌｌｙＥｉｌｅｒｓ）的名字也是不會使人忽略的。特别是和　吉姆斯頓合作的『桃花運』，更見她表演的成功。但是他在這裏所飾的角色却不見如何精采，也許是劇情限了她的發展，比較以前所飾的小家碧玉的角色，到底沒有超越她以往的成績。然而當她在便衣警察面前申述殺人經過的時候，仍然顯出她技術的純熟。</p>
<p>但是除了表演以外，我們還可以發見一些什麽成績呢？不敢恭維，正是内容的空虚，决定了演出的平庸。我不懂爲什麽本片的作者要將一個主角成爲劇的重心，而所得的結果，却又是蒙高茂萊在空無所有的劇情中唱着獨脚戲。同時，我們知道作者的本意，祗是要贈給觀衆一種輕快的消暑劑，可是喜劇的形式。却不一定是一味的輕鬆。平滑的情調固然不能像那悲劇同樣的感人深刻，但是好的喜劇也並非完全不能使人長久的回憶。所以，我以爲這一影片最大的缺感便是不注意情調的起伏，好像白色紙版似的，不能使我發生切身的感覺。這一喜劇比較『百萬金』或是『流水年華』，固然是在任何方面都相形見絀，即比之前面所説的『桃花運』，亦不免望塵莫及。即就Ｍｏｎｔａｇｅ而論，雖不見如何累贅，但亦不見經濟，例如將那賢慧的良妻就寫得非常不夠，尤其是在船上的破鏡重圓，更不應有偶合的取巧。至於説這一對離婚夫婦仍然是心心相印，那末我們除了在説明書以外，書面上是看不出來的。</p>
<p>然而在内容方面，如不計較他庸俗而無聊的缺點，那末多少還可以找出一些意外的收獲。譬如市長以下的諸達官貴人，居然在夜總會中來討論政治問題，以及交際廣闊的夜總會老　，能運其覆雨翻雲之年腕，賄賂説人情，以卑劣的手叚，而使殺人犯脱罪，都可以説明政治的黑暗與法律的欺人。關於這些倒是關懷世道人心的君子們所嘆息的了</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>談談『千古恨』</h3>
<p>— 宜菊</p>
<p>看過了『千古恨』出來，使人感覺到中國小影片公司的出品，還不曾走上正路，十分地使人失望。</p>
<p>『千古恨』開幕的説明，謂本片攝製的目的　，在提倡科學，（大意確是如此）只是劇情的演出，荒唐不經，所謂『提倡科學』，不知從何而説起？在本片裏，只看見幾輛時來時往原汽車，和幾幕滑稽可笑的打架而已。默默地坐了兩小時走出，心中無限悵惘</p>
<p>『千古恨』劇情的演出，不妥之處不知多少：（一）寫羽晴和麗蓮的戀愛生活和　分别情形，從麗蓮的回憶裏演出，殊欠充分，（二）羽晴因拉琴致和傭僕口角，竟起打架，這果是少年人的本色？羽晴旣不是大力士，竟能力敵五六人，這誰信之？（三）寫羽晴家中珠練之失竊，無此容易，竊者如何進屋，也未見演出。（四）麗蓮旣不知老者係志岐之化裝，竟敢大胆尾之，潛入密室，從錢幕上演出看來，麗蓮决非此種女子。（五）志岐因爲麗蓮識破秘密，致起衝突，羽晴走過看見，竟走上和志岐打起架來，這太不近人情，羽晴有什麽權力去干涉他們呢？羽晴又不是一個義俠之士。（六）寫志岐之發明飛機，速率能超過普通飛機三倍，以及光輝之發明飛彈，均未説明原理，使觀衆感覺到莫明其妙</p>
<h3>胡蝶小姐觸景生情</h3>
<p>落雨也有今昔之感</p>
<p>前天氣候悶熱得厲害，恰巧『春蠶』攝製一個落雨的塲面，攝影塲上，打開救火龍頭，大下人工雨，一時水花四濺，漫天飛舞，暑氣爲之消盡，導演程步高脱去了鞋襪，指揮工作，大腿上塗滿了汚泥。胡蝶站在旁邊參觀，看見高倩蘋和王徵信在雨中來往做戲，想起她去年冬天攝製『狂流』的情形來，那時天氣嚴寒，大家都被這狂暴的人造雨，打擊得颯颯地發抖，觸景生情不禁感慨道：高小姐她們眞寫意，在這樣的大熱天來一個冲洗浴：我們去年拍『狂流』，那裏有這樣適意啊！</p>
<p>春蠶散片</p>
<h3>所引起的疑</h3>
<p>— 嚴白璧</p>
<p>丨恰當于都市題材的演員，是否也恰當于農村題材的演出？丨</p>
<p>茅盾的『春蠶』，是曝露農村崩潰的作品。</p>
<p>『春蠶』的成因，我以爲不外是：原著者生長於鄉間經歷着農村崩潰的實感，以富豐的社會科學知識去分析去考察，用活躍的新的文藝技巧寫出。</p>
<p>這『春蠶』，在文藝上，當然是一個寳貴的收獲。現在，它是經明星公司選爲題材，由導演家程步高着手攝製電影了。它將更眞切地展開在更廣大的觀衆面前了。我不禁爲字深深慶賀。</p>
<p>但在最近，從明星公司的明星月刋上，看到他們已攝成的『春蠶』的幾幀散片，却直覺地感到『春蠶』所描寫的不是崩潰了的農村，而是都市化的農村！這雖是關於背景上的小節，然而小節的非眞實』，也會影響到全體的效果。因此，我疑慮到整個電影界的導濱與演員問題恰當於都會題材的導演與演員，是否也恰當於農村題材的演出？過慣都市生活而沒有農村崩落的實感的導演與演員，是否適宜於攝製農村题材的影片編者註：這是一封意見書，我現在以毫無成見的態度公表出來，並希望能喚起關係方面</p>
<p>的注意。不敏</p>
<h3>ＡｌｌＳｔａｒＣａｓｔ</h3>
<p>在最近的一二年來，歐美電影業因受世界經濟不景氣的影響，一度受到極端的窘迫。他們爲了要挽回營業頽勢的緣故，乃不得不利用ＡｌｌＳｔａｒＣａｓｔ來吸引觀衆，當然，這類影片之能否獲得良果，自一疑問，但在影片的實質２上，確曾把演出的水準提高了的</p>
<p>明星公司正在攝製中的有聲鉅片二對一（張石川導演），也可以説是中國第一張的ＡｌｌＳｔａｒＣａｓｔ的影片了。因爲除了胡蝶以外，明星公司所有的明星幾乎完全包羅着。新的演出水準將在不久的將來提示給我們了。</p>

<h3>歐美攝影塲巡禮（八）</h3>
<p>— 雲巖</p>
<p>（十）伊絲林頓（英國）Ｉｓｌｉｎｇｔｏｎ</p>
<p>丨甘斯保洛影片公司影塲在倫敦伊絲林頓丨離開倫敦繁盛的街市，在那工廠，棧房和　陋巷的區域中，當歐戰以前，坐落着一個電力廠，部市鐵道的電流，就是由它供給的，那電廠的烟囱，到現在還　立着；但是下面的建築物，現在己經變成甘斯保洛影片公司的影塲了。</p>
<p>美國的拉斯克影片公司，曾於一九一九年購得那處的地皮，建設攝影塲。在以後四年中伊絲林頓攝影塲，遂成爲優美影片的出產地。到了一九二三年，他們就專把這個影塲租給别家公司拍戲。挑樂絲甘許，那時是伊絲林頓許多明星中的一個傑出者。次年，有三位冒險的倫敦商人丨佛利德門，賽維利和巴爾康丨，又組織新公司，租在這裏拍戲。隔了沒有好久，那甘斯保洛公司接着成立以後。這個塲所也就歸它所有了。至一九二七年。並裝設收音機，拍攝有聲影片。到了一九三○年。不幸火神光臨，把兩座劇塲的頂部，燒得精光。在一九三一年的春天，那重建的新式影塲落成，雖然換了圖樣，　但二樓的裝置，仍如舊式。底下的一號劇塲，面積是六二六四方尺，，上層的劇場是五二四四方尺。頂上一層是平台，是預備攝製外　用的，裏面有三個放映間；一個在底層，差不多有普通的小戲院那末大，還有兩間在地底下，比較小些。</p>

<p>高蒙在英國，就和派拉蒙在好萊塢是一樣的。好萊塢的第一個影塲，是在一處樹林中的一個農舍裏，結果產出派拉蒙的大影塲。而高蒙公司，在一八九八年的時候，也不過是在杜爾維希的市民棍球場攝製影片的。但是現在他們己經擁有英國最佳的影場了。（未完）</p>

<p>French Occupation of Nine Small Islands in Yuehai</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs Is Preparing to File a Protest</h3>
<p>Has Telegraphed the Embassy in France to Inquire About the Truth</p>
<p>The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy Are Planning Coping Measures</p>
<p>Japan Also Attaches Great Importance to This Move by France</p>
<p>It Is Expected That It May Cause a Conflict Between Britain and France</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A Spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Stated That the Coral Islands Between the Philippines and Annam Are Only Inhabited by Our Fishermen on the Islands, and Are Internationally Recognized as Chinese Territory. Recently, We Received an Official Gazette from the French Side, Which Actually Formally Declared Occupation. What Is the Basis for This? The French Government Has Not Announced Its Reasons. In Addition to Telegraphing the Embassy in France to Inquire About the Truth, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Navy Are Actively Planning Coping Measures and Will File a Serious Protest Against This Kind of Action by the French Government. (Special Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Is Now Considering the Event of France's Declaration of Occupation of Nine Small Islands Between Vietnam and the Philippines, and There May Be a Possibility of Filing a Protest. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Since 1918, Japanese Merchants Who Paid Attention to the Island Have Applied to the Government to Estimate and Manage the Island, But So Far, the Japanese Government Has Not Made Any Indication. The Total Area of the Island Is Only 300 Square Miles, or Less Than Half a Square Mile. It Was Occupied by France Between April 7 and 12 This Year. (Reuters Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A French Communication Ship Discovered the Taylor Islands in the South China Sea, and the French Government Announced That It Had Obtained It as Territory Based on the Principle of Prior Acquisition in International Law. The Japanese Navy Is Paying Close Attention Because France Will Take Control of the Naval Supremacy in the South China Sea. The Whole Situation Is That France Has Docks for Accommodating 10,000-Ton Cruisers in Saigon and Guangzhou Bay, and This Time, It Will Build Air Force Bases by Occupying the Islands and Will Be Able to Take Control of the Naval Supremacy in the South China Sea by Equipping Submarines. If So, the Maritime Transportation Between Singapore, the British Base for Entering and Exiting the Far East, and Hong Kong Will Be Cut Off, and the Power of Britain and France May Cause a Crisis of Conflict. (Dentsu Dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The French Government Officially Announced the Occupation of the Nine Coral Islands Between Indochina and the Philippine Islands. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Announced on the 26th That Since Japan Is Close to the Nine Islands, It Has Not Received Any Official Telegrams Regarding France's Declaration of the Territorial Rights of the Nine Small Islands and Cannot Determine the Attitude of the Japanese Government. However, Since Seven or Eight Years Ago, Japanese People Have Lived and Operated on These Islands, Engaged in Phosphate Mining and Other Businesses. Therefore, After Full Research, Japan Will Issue an Opinion. The Japanese Authorities Have Reserved the Right to Speak, But the Chinese Government Also Wants to File a Protest with France, and This Issue Will Become an International Issue.

<h3>On Honesty and Integrity</h3>
<p>People With Aspirations Today Often Attribute the Lack of Solutions in Politics to the Corruption of Officials, and Key Party and National Figures Constantly Strive to Be Honest and Self-Disciplined, and Encourage Their Subordinates With This, Which Can Be Said to Be Repeated Again and Again. However, the Phenomenon of Corruption and Darkness Still Cannot Be Eradicated in Today's Political World. Honesty and Integrity Absolutely Cannot Coexist. In Today's Unequal Society, Absolutely Honest Politics Cannot Be Produced. Even If There Are One or Two Honest Officials Who Want to Build Something Strikingly in This Corrupt Environment, They Will Eventually End Up Assimilating With the Corruption. Tracing Back to Previous History, This Is Invariably True. During the Period of Xianfeng and Tongzhi in the Late Qing Dynasty, Hong Yang Established a Country in Nanjing. Qing Officials Zeng Guofan and Hu Linyi Raised Troops in Hunan and Hubei to Confront the Taiping Army. However, Zeng and Hu Were Both Han Chinese, and the Qing Court Did Not Trust Them. They Specifically Appointed the Banner Man Guan Wen as the Governor-General of Huguang to Supervise Them. Guan Wen's Corruption Was [Blank]. When Hu Was the Governor of Hubei, He Disliked Him Very Much. One Day, He Suddenly Thought of This and Prepared a Memorandum to Impeach Guan's Misconduct and Expose His Acts of Soliciting Power and Accepting Bribes to the Court. He Wandered Around the Room, Unable to Decide. At That Time, Yan Duanmin Public Lived in the Curtain and Asked Strangely. Public Informed Yan That Guan, Although Corrupt, Only Cost Public Hundreds of Thousands of Gold Each Year. However, He Was Stupid and Had No Distant Ambitions. Therefore, He Entrusted All Major Policies to Public Public, and Public Was Able to Calmly Show His Ambitions. If Guan Was Gone, A Smart and Strong Person Would Come, and Everything Would Be Done Personally. Public Would Not Be Able to Do Anything. Hu Realized Greatly. Then He Tried His Best to Befriend Guan Wen. Guan Wen Listened to Hu More and More. Hu Was Able to Become a Famous Minister of the Qing Dynasty Because of Yan's Words. However, the Unremovable Nature of Corrupt Forces Can Also Be Understood.</p>
<p>Before the Qing Dynasty Was Built, Feng Xu Was an Official in Anhui and Held Himself With the Integrity of the Han Dynasty. His Staff Did Not Dare Not to Encourage Each Other to Be Honest. However, Feng Was Involved in the Case of Xu Xilin's Assassination of Governor En. The Relatives of En Who Were Dissatisfied Concocted Rumors Saying That Feng Protected the Revolutionaries. The Qing Court Secretly Sent Prince Zhen to Investigate. Zhen Solicited 100,000 Yuan in Bribes From Feng. As an Honest Official, He Had Never Had Any Ointment From the People in His Pocket to Welcome Him. Before Long, Feng Was Dismissed. This Also Shows That Corruption Is Enough to Corrupt Honest Politics.</p>
<p>The Former Is to Compliment the Corrupt Power and Authority and Survive. The Latter Was Dismissed From Office for Offending the Corrupt Authority. It Is Recorded in History That Every Step Is Incorrect. The Ancients Said, "The Failure of the Country Is Due to the Evil of Officials, and the Loss of Virtue of Officials Is Due to Indulging in Gifts and Regulations." Official Evil and Indulgence in Gifts and Regulations, Corruption Competes With Each Other. It Can Be Said to Be Fierce Today. However, When We Discuss Things, We Should Not Just Hold Ethical and Moral Concepts and Sigh That People's Hearts Are Not Old. The Failure of National Affairs Is Firmly Caused by Corruption, and What Does Corruption Come From? What Does Honesty and Integrity Die From? It Can Not Be Solved by Abstract Nouns Such as Neo-Confucianism's Benevolence, Justice, Faith, and Dao. It Must Be Traced to the Cause of Its Occurrence and the Source of Its Destruction and Govern It Before It Can Be Discussed With the World.</p>
<p>I Have Said It Before. "In Today's Unequal Society, Absolutely Honest Politics Cannot Be Produced." In Society, There Are People Who Get Something Without Work, and There Are People Who Are Diligent All Year Round and Have Nothing. Possession of Everything Is Opposite to Having Nothing. The Privilege Society Is Born. The Power of Officials Is Growing, and the Power of Gentlemen Is Growing. Then the Habits of Pride, Luxury, Licentiousness, and Misconduct and Corruption Arise. Therefore, To Practice Honest Politics Today, We Must First Eradicate This Contradictory Phenomenon and Curb This Unlimited Power of Officials and Gentlemen. On the One Hand, Severe Penalties Are Imposed on Corrupt Officials. The Greater the Official, the Greater the Punishment. Do Not Just Impeach Foxes Without Asking About Wolves. National Affairs Can Be Done. Otherwise, Verbal Bulletins Will Become a Cover, and Honesty and Integrity Will Eventually Be Impossible to Achieve.</p>
<p>Senior Officials Decided</p>
<h3>Indefinite Postponement of the Economic Conference</h3>
<p>Hull's Proposal to Set a Reopening Date Rejected</p>
<p>Closing Session to Be Held Today</p>
<p>Seven Nations' Representatives to Speak</p>
<p>Australia Finalizes Nine-Nation Silver Agreement Yesterday</p>
<p>(London) The Presidium of the World Economic Conference held a meeting today and decided that the Economic Conference would be indefinitely postponed from Thursday of this week. During the discussion, U.S. Chief Delegate Secretary of State Hull proposed that the sub-committee of the Economic Committee dealing with commercial policy continue its work to discuss the U.S. proposal to extend the tariff truce. Mr. Hull also advocated that the date for the Economic Conference to resume its work should be set before November 1st. Both proposals were rejected due to strong opposition from representatives of other countries. After the adjournment of the Presidium, an announcement was issued stating that the Presidium recommended that the Economic Conference should authorize the Presidium and its Chairman to (1) take all measures that they deem beneficial to the success of the Economic Conference, such as (a) convening any of the sub-committees or panels established by the Economic Conference, or convening representatives of countries that have a special relationship with the issue when discussing a specific issue, (b) referring certain specialized issues to experts for research; (2) set the date for the future convening of the Economic Conference. The plenary session of the Economic Conference is scheduled to be held on Thursday to approve the postponement method. (25th, Havas)</p>

<h3>Today's Closing Session</h3>
<p>Considering the Report of the Steering Committee</p>
<p>(London) Arrangements have been made in advance for the final plenary session to be held tomorrow. After the reports of the rapporteurs, French Finance Minister Bonnet and British businessman Sir Arthur Salter, are passed, the meeting will consider the report of the Steering Committee and debate the work of the conference and the prospects for the future. There is no doubt that the Steering Committee's proposal to temporarily adjourn the meeting and allow the Steering Committee to consider the matter of reconvening will be approved by the meeting. (26th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(London) A general debate will be held at the plenary session of the Economic Conference tomorrow to discuss various issues that the Presidium has already reviewed, such as the method of convening the next meeting. So far, representatives from seven countries, including the United States, France, Britain, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands, and Czechoslovakia, have signed up to participate in the general debate. (26th, Havas)</p>
<p>(London) The Japanese delegation held a full-power meeting on the 25th and decided that if there is an opportunity at the Economic Conference on the 27th, it will reiterate Japan's views, advocating the unconditional application of the most-favored-nation clause and the elimination of trade barriers. Ishii has already prepared a draft speech. (25th, Japanese League Wire)</p>
<h3>Steering Committee Will Not Be Dissolved</h3>
<p>(London) It is reported that the final meeting of the World Economic Conference tomorrow will decide on the continuation of the conference, instructing the Steering Committee to reconvene the conference when the environment indicates that discussions can be successful. The Steering Committee's Guidance Committee will continue to serve, and countries can be represented by their ambassadors.</p>
<h3>U.S. Prepares to Propose New Monetary Recommendations</h3>
<p>(London) It is reported that the Chairman of the Monetary and Financial Committee, American Cox, will propose a form of government bond. This proposal will greatly reform the European standard, so if this proposal is established, it will have a far-reaching impact. (26th, Reuters)</p>

<p>(London) Dr. Yan Huiqing has returned to Moscow today. No Chinese representative will speak at tomorrow's plenary session. (26th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Australia Signs Silver Agreement</h3>
<p>(London) Australia is scheduled to sign the silver agreement this afternoon. This is the only news about the World Economic Conference today. (26th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Pessimism in Mexican Silver Circles</h3>
<p>Mexico City Although the Mexican Minister of Finance also signed the silver agreement of the World Economic Conference, silver market leaders here are pessimistic, believing that the agreement lacks clarity. If the silver price matches the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar, Mexico can benefit, but according to their opinion, artificial inflation of prices raised by agreement methods will definitely not succeed. (25th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>Criticism from the President of the U.S. Mining Association</h3>
<p>Salt Lake City, USA The President of the American Silver Mining Association, Meng Feili, said here today that plans regarding silver will not be stable unless silver is recognized as a basic currency. The independent actions of the United States have been clearly demonstrated in the silver agreement established in London. It is incredible that U.S. representatives were induced to agree to any plan that does not recognize silver as a primary currency. U.S. representatives went to London with the clear intention of the Senate and House of Representatives to achieve this goal through unremitting efforts. If this is not the case, they will not obtain the consent of Congress. If only a method is established to regard silver as a commodity, even if it is beneficial, it will be insufficient. (25th, Reuters)</p>
<h3>The World's Attention is on the Dumping of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Ishii Appeals Loudly to the Country</p>
<p>Advocates Controlling Exports to Seek Reconciliation</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese economic representative, Ishii, broadcast a speech to Japan by radio on the 24th. The content is as follows: Before and after the opening of the economic conference, what caught our attention was the profoundness of the economic problems that all countries in the world are worried about and the intensity of competition among countries. It is truly shocking for us that all countries are vigorously promoting that Japan is surpassing other countries and invading the world market. The U.S. President and the British Prime Minister also believe in the figures of this propaganda. Once the World Economic Conference breaks down, it will immediately turn into a world economic war, as people in all countries have said. At the beginning of this economic war, Japan is uniquely regarded as the invading king of the world market, and there is no doubt that Japan will be oppressed in various ways and in various forms. Japan must be prepared in advance, and the most important thing is to implement strict control over overseas exports. (26th, Japanese League Wire)</p>
<h3>Japanese Pharmaceutical Industry Competes with Foreign Countries</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese pharmaceutical industry has made great progress in recent years, with an annual output of 40 to 50 million yuan. However, imported drugs into the country are worth more than 10 million yuan every year. The Ministry of Interior's Health Bureau has decided to actively revitalize domestic production. The specific method is to organize a pharmaceutical export association with famous pharmaceutical companies in Tokyo and Osaka. On the one hand, it prevents the import of foreign goods, and on the other hand, it actively promotes foreign exports. At present, the most promising markets overseas are South America, Southeast Asia, and India. (26th, Japanese League Wire)</p>
<p>Britain, India, and Japan Will</p>
<h3>Hold a Meeting in India</h3>
<p>Japanese Cotton Industry Agrees to Discuss Low Prices</p>
<p>London British Trade Department Parliamentary Secretary Perkin stated on behalf of the government in the Lower House today that the Japanese cotton industry has agreed to discuss the low prices of competitive products with the British cotton industry under certain restrictions. Britain has proposed that representatives from Britain, India, and Japan hold a three-party discussion in India, covering all textile matters related to the three parties.</p>
<p>The British government hopes that the Japanese government can represent its cotton industry to accept this proposal and obtain a satisfactory agreement through discussion. (25th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of the Japan-India Treaty, the expiration date of October 10th is approaching, but the British government and its operators have not shown sincerity. The Indian government is also worried about the attitude of the British government, so it is difficult to expect an effective solution. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that it is necessary to change the fundamental policy of commercial diplomacy with India. According to the reports of Ambassador Matsudaira to Britain and Consul General Miyake to Calcutta on the 25th, although Britain and India are unwilling to formally codify commercial negotiations with Japan, they hope that the substantial commercial relations with Japan will continue to be good. Even after the treaty is abolished, Britain and India are still prepared to take measures to avoid drastic changes. On the other hand, Japanese business operators, regarding the impact of the abolition of the treaty, with a deep determination and spirit of unity, delaying the dispatch of representatives is counterproductive. Therefore, they also advised the foreign affairs authorities. After considering the above matters, the authorities have generally decided that the government representative, Minister Sawada, and his party will depart from Tokyo on August 10th and take the Terukuni Maru from Kobe to India on the 11th. (26th, Dentsu Wire)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Consul General Miyake stationed in Simla to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Indian government has issued a consultation letter consisting of fifteen items to various industry groups due to the need to apply the Industrial Protection Law, ordering a reply before the end of the month. If the reply is insufficient, representatives of various industries will be summoned to inquire about the details. The consultation letter includes production status, import ratio, import price, labor status, and comparison with the cost of domestic production. Especially for Japanese goods, detailed investigations are required. Therefore, the Indian government apparently wants to use this to build countermeasures for the Simla meeting, and its intention seems to be to further suppress Japanese goods. (26th, Dentsu Wire)</p>
<h3>South Africa Rejects Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Japan's Protest Ineffective</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that South Africa and the Straits Settlements' increase in tariffs on Japanese goods violates the tariff truce case and protested to the British government. Ambassador Matsudaira to Britain reported on the 26th that the British government replied that the colonies' increase in tariffs on Japanese hats, lace, embroidery, etc. was before the establishment of the tariff truce case, so Britain believes that it does not violate the case.

<p>U.S. Government Will</p>
<h3>Implement the National Recovery Plan Starting Today</h3>
<p>Will Do Everything Possible to Shut Foreign Goods Out of the Domestic Market</p>
<p>Various Industries Have Submitted Industry Regulations One After Another</p>
<p>Speculation in the Grain Market Swept Away</p>
<p>(Washington) The troublesome issues in the grain market have been resolved because the national exchanges have negotiated new industry regulations and rectified themselves. The U.S. government will now fully implement its National Recovery Plan starting on Thursday. It is expected that various other industries will also follow the food merchants and quickly comply with government expectations, increase wages, and shorten working hours. In order to reward the cooperation of the industry, the government will also do everything possible to assist various industries, and even prepare to shut foreign goods that compete fiercely with U.S. goods out of the U.S. market. At the same time, the government has started mailing cotton survey orders to cotton planters. The government now plans to provide cash subsidies for destroyed cotton seedlings, giving 20 yuan per acre for land that can produce 100 to 124 pounds of cotton per acre. Up to now, the textile, steel, and petroleum industries have submitted industry regulations. In addition, the government has formulated temporary industry regulations based on the general principles in the textile industry regulations for various industries to temporarily adopt before negotiating industry regulations. It is expected that various industries will accept them on Thursday. (25th, National Wire)</p>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. grain exchanges have been reorganized internally and submitted new industry regulations today. According to this new plan, malpractices such as price surges and squeezes can be completely eliminated. From now on, grain trading will lose most of its speculative color and become a real transaction. The first article is to permanently limit the price fluctuations. The price of wheat cannot fluctuate more than five cents in a day, corn four cents, and other miscellaneous grains three cents. This restriction will prevent the food market from attracting the attention of speculators. Secondly, the bad habit of buying futures at a price different from the market price on the same day is completely abolished. Again, brokers are forced to immediately request additional margin when the market situation changes, and the percentage varies according to the amount of their transaction. For example, the percentage of margin for 100,000 bushels will be greater than 50,000 bushels to prevent speculators from creating a position to manipulate the market. The total amount of long and short positions that each merchant can make will also be regulated, that is, the operation of grain purchase capital groups will also have considerable restrictions. It is reported that Agricultural Recovery Administrator Peek approved these industry regulations and will promote them in exchanges across the country. In addition, grain traders also submitted a part of the proposed industry regulations today after being ordered by the government to improve trade methods. A formal industry regulation will be submitted soon. Tonight, it is heard that grain experts agree with this plan and believe that this move will have an important international impact, which can avoid the dumping of foreign grain, and the permitted price fluctuation limit is still sufficient to guarantee that there can be an active market at any time.

<p>Women Enter Politics</p>
<h3>Still Can't Shake Off Femininity</h3>
<p>Likes Vanity and Doesn't Like to Tell Her Age</p>
<p>Reuters Washington Correspondence Women can't shed their femininity after all, even if they enter politics and hold important positions. This is still the case. In the recently published Congressional Member Biographical Directory, all female congressmen except two are unwilling to state their age. For example, Ms. Perkins, Minister of Labor, Senator Caraway, Congressman Kahn, Norden, Jenkins, etc., no one knows their date of birth. Moreover, it can be seen from the Who's Who that women like to praise themselves. For example, under the names of Senator Caraway and Congressman Kahn, there are four lines for each person. As for Ms. Perkins, the first female cabinet member in the United States, there are twenty-one lines under her name.</p>

<p>National Palace Museum Case</p>
<h3>Zhang Ji Issues Statement</h3>

The original text is as follows: "11. Director Wang and Director Wu proposed that regarding the litigation events of the museum, the court is currently investigating. The museum's board of directors should first investigate and report to the government for reference by the judiciary to decide whether to file a lawsuit." There are no words in the resolution that the court should suspend proceedings during the board's investigation. The report differs from the original draft, which may cause suspicion in society that the board of directors has interfered with the judiciary. Therefore, it is clarified.

<p>The Tragedy of the Sheng An Steamer</p>
<h3>Preliminary Investigation Completed</h3>
<p>To Be Tried in Dalian</p>
<p>(Dalian) The preliminary investigation conducted by the authorities regarding the four German and one Swiss perpetrators in the Sheng'an steamboat tragedy has been completed. All investigations were conducted secretly by the local prosecutor's office. Reuters has learned that the authorities are now considering how and when to announce the results of their investigation and adjudication. Although there is no accurate news at present, it is believed that the case will be tried in Dalian. According to the Chief Prosecutor, Japanese law absolutely does not allow anyone to visit prisoners in police custody, and he stated that recently, personnel from the local German consulate attempted to visit the German suspects but were also refused. Japanese and foreigners alike do not believe the Swiss suspect, Gao Qi's, claim that the five of them planned to sail the Sheng'an to 渥伯瑞蘇 across the Pacific Ocean to sell the ship and all its cargo. It is widely believed that the true motive of the five for seizing the ship has not yet been revealed. All kinds of news currently circulating are merely speculations. One theory is that they may have planned to sell the Sheng'an to a ship-breaking company not far from Dalian. According to unofficial sources, Dao Ding spoke the least among the five, while Gao Qi spoke the most. Dao Ding claimed that he was not involved in the killings, nor did he know anything about them. Furthermore, according to unconfirmed reports, Westerman, formerly of Shanghai, killed the most people on the Sheng'an, followed by Gao Qi. According to official inspections, Dao Ding's pistol was found not to have been fired recently. To date, the five have been detained for four weeks. (Reuters dispatch, 26th)</p>

<h3>Germany Implements Eugenics</h3>
<p>Eliminating Those Unfit to Survive</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 26th - The German cabinet will soon approve a law to eliminate those unfit to survive. This law stipulates that any person who is an incurable drunkard, sex offender, epileptic, or suffers from an incurable disease that is likely to be passed on to future generations, may be forcibly eliminated if a majority of specialist doctors determine that it is necessary for the happiness of the country. However, they are allowed to appeal to a specially established higher health court in the future.</p>
<p>(National Daily, Berlin, 25th) The German government today promulgated a new decree that anyone suffering from neurasthenia, epilepsy, or significant hereditary physiological defects shall not be allowed to have children. The government's opinion on this measure is that healthy parents generally produce only one or two children, while parents with unhealthy bodies and minds also produce countless children with the same unhealthy bodies and minds. These unhealthy children must ultimately be raised by the state, and the state treasury spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year, which is taken from healthy parents who produce healthy children. Therefore, in the current situation, there is no other good way to provide relief except to vigorously eliminate their reproductive capacity. Therefore, the government believes that this new decree is a charitable decree and will surely benefit from it in the future. Furthermore, in order to prevent people from recognizing this decree as a punishment for people who are physically or mentally weak, criminals are not included in the category of eliminating reproduction, and separate provisions will be made for the disposal of criminal reproduction. This new decree will be implemented from January 1st next year.</p>
<p>Drafted by the Ministry of Justice</p>
<h3>Measures for Solving Sexual Desire of Prisoners</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Justice has drafted measures for prisoners to solve their sexual desires. The content and nature are different from those in the former Qing Dynasty. In the past, it was a matter of succession. For example, if a newly married man, who is the only son, suddenly commits a serious crime or is sentenced to life imprisonment or many years of imprisonment, the family requests that his wife be allowed to cohabitate with him so that she can become pregnant and avoid extinction. After obtaining permission from the court, they are temporarily released for cohabitation for a set period of one or two days and then return to prison. This time, the planned measures are not for the issue of succession, but to take reward measures. For example, if they behave well in prison until the statutory period, they can have the hope of resolving their sexual desires. If they are divided into several levels and reach a certain level and their good behavior meets the conditions, they will have this right. Otherwise, they will have no such hope. This is to influence young people to get on the right track. Because there is this hope, they will definitely behave well in prison, and their bad behavior and character can therefore be expected to be quickly changed. This measure will be decided after it is reviewed by the central government. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3>Issue of Opening Brothels in Nanjing City</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Interior has studied in detail the issue of opening brothels in Nanjing City. It believes that the prohibition or opening of prostitution should be based on the actual situation, and social order and the health of the people should be taken into consideration. Nanjing is the capital, and it was originally hoped that it would be purified and that a new foundation would be established, but private prostitutes are rampant. Recently, the municipal authorities have proposed reopening the ban. The ministry, in its capacity, held a meeting to study the issue and agreed that public prostitution is certainly not unspeakable, but private prostitution should be strictly investigated and banned, and attention should be paid to physical examinations and gradual elimination. From this, the situation of easing the ban is gradually becoming powerful. However, what is difficult to write is still a public document to ease the ban.

The news has greatly surprised everyone. The newspaper also claimed that the reason for giving Trotsky this position is that Trotsky has a thorough understanding of Spanish politics.

<h3>More Than a Thousand Party Members Arrested</h3>
<p>Havas, Madrid, 26th - The government continues to take preventive measures to avoid the occurrence of disturbances. It is reported that the purpose of this attempt is to change the national system. More than a thousand people have been arrested throughout the country because of this case, and most of them have been detained. The Minister of the Interior declared that the police are carrying out a large-scale cleaning operation. In addition, the House of Representatives passed a draft law yesterday to allow strict measures to be taken against the criminals in this case. Detailed reports are still lacking on the exact circumstances of the conspiracy. It is generally believed that this conspiracy belongs to the fascist party nature. Most of the arrested young people carry membership certificates of the Fascist Party Youth Association. Although this organization is still in its infancy, its principals have raised a large amount of money for the purpose of uprising. The source of the money is still unclear. The party also has a large number of arms and weapons. In addition, after the conspiracy case was uncovered, many anarcho-syndicalists were arrested. They protested their arrest and said that they had nothing to do with the Fascist Party, but they are still detained and will be dealt with after new orders are obtained. Because the government has taken these preventive measures, order has not been disturbed at all.</p>

<p>Hungarian Prime Minister Discusses with Mussolini</p>
<h3>Revising the Treaty of Trianon</h3>
<p>At the Same Time, Dealing with Hitler's Policy on the Danube</p>
<p>Methods to Ease the Ethnic Disputes between the United States and Canada Will Also Be Discussed</p>
<p>Reuters, Rome, 26th - Hungarian Prime Minister Dr. Gömbös and Foreign Minister Dr. Kánya arrived here last night. It is expected that the main purpose of their visit is to conduct international talks. The possibility of revising the Treaty of Trianon will probably be discussed with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and others today. In addition, methods to ease the ethnic disputes between the United States and Canada and solutions to the difficulties caused by German Chancellor Hitler's vigorous implementation of his economic and political policies in the Danube countries may also be discussed. The Treaty of Trianon was signed by the Allied Powers and Hungary on June 4, 1920. According to this treaty, Hungary lost a lot of land. Its northern part was ceded to Czechoslovakia, and its southern part was ceded to Yugoslavia. At the same time, it gave up Hungary and other lands formerly belonging to the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Hungary's independence may not be transferred without the consent of the League of Nations. Havas, Rome, 25th - Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, accompanied by Foreign Minister Kanya and his entourage, departed from the Hungarian capital last night and will arrive here tonight. The talks between the Italian and Hungarian authorities will continue for two days. At present, a large-scale movement is underway internationally to prepare for the transformation of Central and Eastern Europe and to establish a foundation for peace. The arrival of the Hungarian political leader in Italy coincides with this movement. Italy is extremely concerned about maintaining the balance of power in Central and Eastern Europe and will definitely use its potential power in Central and Eastern Europe in a fair and honest manner to achieve a stable balance. It is deliberately the case that during the talks between the Italian and Hungarian authorities, Mussolini will probably not firmly support all events that could lead Hungary and its neighbors to extremes, such as the issue of revising the treaty that Hungarian newspapers have repeatedly demanded. Hungarian people here refuted the remarks of the Hungarian newspaper Az Est, saying that Gömbös's visit to Italy will definitely not realize the Eastern Locarno Treaty and revise the treaty.</p>
<p>Havas, Rome, 26th - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini met with Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and Foreign Minister Kanya for a long time. This afternoon, the Italian Prime Minister will go to the residence of the Hungarian delegation to return the visit to Gömbös. In addition, economic talks will be held by experts from both sides. The true meaning of the Italian Prime Minister's talks with the Hungarian Prime Minister is still difficult to determine, but political circles believe that the main point of the two people's talks should be the issue of the relations between Hungary and Austria. Italy hopes that the economic proximity between Hungary and Austria will increase Italy's status for Germany and the Little Entente countries. Regarding the Italian Prime Minister's talks with the Hungarian Prime Minister, Italian newspapers have repeatedly said that since the establishment of the Four-Power Pact, all issues have begun to be discussed, which is completely different from the situation when Prime Minister Gömbös visited Italy in November. The Envoy newspaper said, "The Four-Power Pact has fundamentally changed the international political atmosphere, and all proposals for international rapprochement or understanding are possible because of this pact." The People's Daily hopes that the Italian Prime Minister and the Hungarian Prime Minister will start discussing "issues of common interest to the two countries, because this issue has special value in the new international situation created by the Four-Power Pact."</p>

<h3>Openly Saying Merging Austria</h3>
<p>German Planes Drop Leaflets Attacking Austrian Prime Minister Havas, Vienna, 25th - The speech made by Valushtek, an important member of the Austrian national capital socialist party, in Garloch, Germany, has shocked political circles. Valu's speech about the attempt of the National Socialist Party was straightforward, and it was said that once Austria established a national socialist party government, the National Socialist Party members of Germany and Austria would immediately promote the realization of the merger of Germany and Austria, regardless of the provisions of the treaty. Valu said, "If one day Mr. Hitler also becomes the Prime Minister of Austria, then we can realize the hope of the Great German Empire under the banner of the swastika. We hope that the regime we have won in Austria will not encounter any resistance, but if France still helps Austria to resist our party, we will take any measures to restore our freedom." Havas, Vienna, 25th - A message was received here from Bregen Castle that a German plane flew over the top of Vorarlberg and dropped leaflets attacking the Taerfis cabinet. The Austrian government protested to the German government again that German planes had violated Austrian territory.</p>

<h3>Insufficient Protection of Citizens</h3>
<p>Air Defense Exercise Discovers Danger</p>
<p>China United News Agency, Tokyo, 26th - Regarding the air defense exercise in Tokyo, after the results of the two preliminary exercises, the military has conducted a rigorous scientific study and found that Tokyo has many shortcomings. Without improvement, it may not be enough to defend against enemy air raids. The so-called shortcomings in air defense are as follows: (1) The subway is the best refuge for citizens, but the subway in Tokyo is only five to ten feet deep from the ground. Bombs with a yield of ten to twenty-five killoton are sufficient to destroy this equipment and can only accommodate 130,000 people. (2) The cement and steel bars used in various high-rise buildings are very thin. Bombing with a 500-kiloton bomb is sufficient to penetrate five floors, and the equipment in each house is very small. (3) The iron pipes for tap water and fire are buried very shallow underground. Once bombed in the air, it cannot be guaranteed to be safe and sound. It must be remedied as soon as possible. Once something happens, it cannot guarantee the water and fire needed by citizens. Only after two small exercises have such major shortcomings been discovered, then the air defense problem in Tokyo after the big exercise may become a major problem.</p>

<p>Observe the Situation and Await</p>
<h3>Lushan Conference Resolution</h3>
<p>Feng's Attitude Remains Firm</p>
<p>Personnel Adjustments in the Chahar Military</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: The solution to the Chahar situation has still not been found. Recently, Feng expressed again that unless the central government has an entire anti-Japanese plan, the name of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army cannot be cancelled. Generals such as Fang Zhenwu have also issued a telegram stating that unless the truce agreement is overturned and the lost territory is recovered, the anti-Japanese goal will not be achieved, and military action cannot be ended. The Pingfang authorities believe that these statements by Feng and others are absolutely non-negotiable. Therefore, since Deng Zhexi, Li Xin, and others left Ping for Tianjin, and Ma Boyuan returned to Ping from Zhangjiakou to report on his mission, the mediation action has completely stalled. Song Zheyuan asked for leave to recuperate due to a recurrence of his back pain and planned to live temporarily in the Western Hills. Therefore, the future of the Chahar situation is becoming more pessimistic. However, Pingfang is still waiting for the Lushan Conference to indicate the final decision.</p>
<p>The troops that entered Chahar to fill the defenses were originally Pang Bingxun's 40th Army, Guan Linzheng's 25th Division, and the troops of He Sui and Feng Qinzai. Pang's troops were the main force, so Pang was appointed as the commander-in-chief, and all armies were under Pang's control. Since the mobilization, Pang's troops have been in the front, followed by He's and Guan's troops, gradually departing from Juyong Pass, advancing along the railway line from Kangzhuang to Huailai, then to Shacheng, and then to Xiahuayuan, with great momentum. However, Pang's troops were mostly reorganized from the old Northwest Army. Since arriving near Xiahuayuan and Xinzhuangzi and approaching Feng's troops, a part suddenly acted freely. Pang changed the brigade commander of that part and urgently sought to reorganize it. The day before yesterday, near Xiahuayuan, another part was unstable, and troops were immediately sent to suppress it. There was a slight movement near the railway, and the situation was tense for a while and then calmed down. After this incident, in order to rectify military discipline and consolidate defense, the current defense area was slightly adjusted. Since the day before yesterday, Pang's troops have withdrawn from the front, and Wang Jingjiu's division has been transferred to fill the defense. Wang's troops have departed from Baoding and are heading out of Juyong Pass. Wang himself also came to Ping from Baoding at 1:00 p.m. today to visit He Yingqin and ask for instructions. Pang Bingxun also sent Deputy Commander Ma Dewu to Ping to visit the authorities due to the change of defense area and to contact various parties. He also returned to the defense area today to report on his mission. At present, the final line of the troops in the front has reached near Xinzhuangzi. The troops of Sun Liangcheng and Fang Zhenwu of Feng's troops are between Xinzhuangzi and Xuanhua, only fourteen or five li apart, forming a confrontation. However, all troops have been ordered to temporarily remain in their original defenses and await orders. Although the situation is tense, there is no change temporarily. Sun Dianying's troops are departing one after another. A part has arrived in Baotou, and the majority are still concentrated between Chaigoubao and Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua, waiting for money to move west. Sun Dianying suddenly fell ill and was hospitalized in Suiyuan the day before yesterday and telegraphed Pingfang, requesting famous doctors to go for diagnosis and treatment. The date of going to Baotou must be slightly delayed. The entire movement of the troops has also been affected. It is difficult to predict when they will be completely evacuated from Chahar.

<h3>Worldwide Market Rejects Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>Countries Lay a Net of Vigilance Against Japan</p>
<p>Tokyo Houchi Shimbun reported on the 23rd that, due to Japan's industrial rationalization and low labor costs, all of its goods are poised to sweep the global market. Recently, the exchange rate has fallen, further accelerating this trend. As a result, various countries around the world have jointly laid a net of vigilance against it. Since the failure of the World Economic Conference, economic nationalism has intensified. Japanese goods have been transformed and are now being rejected by markets worldwide. There have been frequent reports of suspending most-favored-nation treatment and abrogating trade agreements. Currently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is continuously receiving reports from various locations about the increasingly deteriorating anti-Japanese sentiment. After Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, it has strived to plan individual reciprocal agreements from an independent diplomatic standpoint to break through the difficult economic situation. However, circumstances have presented various difficulties. According to a survey by the authorities, the situation of worldwide market rejection of Japanese goods is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Britain: It has raised tariffs on Japanese goods such as iron products, rubber products, porcelain, silk and silk fabrics, dyes, and hats to counteract them and advocates the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce. (2) British India: It has raised tariffs on rayon fabrics, cotton fabrics, towels, cotton yarn, paper, cement, iron products, glass, rubber, shoes, leather, pencils, umbrellas, beer, soap, raw silk, shell buttons, porcelain, cotton cloth, etc. The Sino-Indian Treaty of Commerce completely expires on October 10th. (3) Australia: It is currently investigating the types of Japanese goods being dumped and is consulting with the British government on ways to reject them. (4) Federated Malay States: It recently raised tariffs on Japanese goods such as cotton cloth and rayon. (5) Johor, Southern Malaya: It has also raised tariffs on Japanese goods. (6) British East Africa: In addition to the previously set ad valorem tax on Japanese goods such as rayon cloth, cotton fabrics, bicycles, and wool blankets, it has also imposed specific duties and prevented the import of cheap goods. (7) British West Africa: The British government has announced the abolition of the Anglo-Japanese Treaty of Commerce. (8) South African Federation: Although it has not yet outwardly rejected Japanese goods, it is likely to follow the trend in other British territories, given the situation in those regions. (9) Malta: It has prevented the import of cheap Japanese goods such as cotton products and groceries. (10) Dutch East Indies: It recently announced restrictions on the import of Japanese cement and raised tariffs on cotton cloth, beer, etc. (11) The United States: In 1931 and 1932, Congress passed bills imposing countervailing duties and other special taxes on imported Japanese goods. Currently, it has specifically raised tariffs on Japanese goods. On the one hand, it restricts the import of cheap Japanese goods through administrative orders in accordance with the National Industrial Recovery Act. (12) Egypt: It has raised special taxes on Japanese cotton yarn cloth and rayon fabrics. (13) Turkey: It has stipulated import quotas and prevented the import of cheap Japanese goods. (14) Greece: Since June 23, it has prohibited the exchange of cheap goods for Japanese imports. Hereafter, it will not allow Japanese goods to be imported into Greece except through barter. (15) Belgium: It is currently discussing restricting the import of Japanese goods and studying ways to reject them.</p>
<h3>The War Zone Has Already Been Taken Over</h3>
<p>The Puppet Army Has Started to Be Reorganized into the Second Contingent</p>
<p>The Beining Railway Will Be Open to Traffic After the Takeover is Completed</p>
<p>Whether Our Sovereignty is Restricted is Still Questionable</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Peiping: The issue of the puppet army, which posed the greatest obstacle to the takeover of the war zone, has been completely resolved after days of consultation. The large sum of money demanded by the puppet army has been successively remitted to Tangshan by the takeover committee. The first payment was 140,000 yuan, and the second was over 100,000 yuan, with more to follow. The puppet army, having achieved its wish, complied and began to concentrate in Tangshan, Xugezhuang, Beidaihe, Luohe, Fengrun, and other places from the previous day, awaiting reorganization. The puppet army in the Ninghe area completely withdrew to Fengrun yesterday, and other scattered puppet troops are also concentrating in designated locations nearby and will begin reorganization immediately. The scope of the reorganization remains as originally agreed, with 10,000 men, 4,000 to be reorganized and 6,000 to be demobilized. The demobilized soldiers will be transported to Machang and sent back to their hometowns separately. The first train will be loaded with goods in Anshan and depart for Xikai tomorrow (the 26th), and the second and third trains will be loaded with goods in Luanxian the day after tomorrow (the 27th). The fourth train will be loaded with goods in Xugezhuang on the 28th. Li Jichun requested six months to complete the reorganization, but after negotiation, it was limited to three months. The 4,000 reorganized puppet soldiers will be formed into the Second Special Police Contingent, stationed in Luanzhou and Fengrun counties. Shi Yousan's troops are currently being negotiated with by Liu Shisun of the takeover committee, and they are generally ready and are being successively transferred to Yutian County to await reorganization. In the future, they will be incorporated into the Second Contingent, merging with the 4,000 reorganized puppet soldiers. The Hebei Provincial Government will separately organize 4,000 special police officers to form the First Contingent, which will be directly trained by the provincial government and stationed in various counties in the war zone. The Committee for Taking Over the War Zone is proceeding with the takeover. In addition to dispatching teams along two routes as originally planned, Li Zeyi will be stationed in Peiping to facilitate contact during the takeover and handle negotiations with all parties. Yin Tong and Wei Jian will be in Tianjin to handle all matters, and Lei Shourong and Xue Zhiheng will be stationed in Tangshan to facilitate contact at any time. Tao Shangming will be responsible for the takeover in northern Peiping. When taking over counties with Japanese troops stationed, the Japanese military will send personnel to accompany the takeover team. Within the scope of the puppet army's territory, Li Jichun will send personnel to accompany the takeover team. Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Takeover Committee, will oversee everything. Yu had originally received a telegram summoning him to the Lushan Conference, but he was unable to attend because he was in the process of taking over the war zone. The takeover on the eastern route will begin in Tangshan. Song Naigan, the Tangshan Special Public Security Bureau Chief dispatched by the provincial government, arrived in Tangshan with Lei Shourong the day before yesterday (the 23rd). The takeover was originally scheduled for yesterday (the 24th), but it could not be carried out as scheduled because it was necessary to consult with Guo Xixian, the puppet bureau chief appointed by Li Jichun, on the handover procedures. Li Jichun hosted a banquet yesterday to welcome them and introduce Song and Guo to discuss the matter, and it was decided to carry out the takeover today. At 10 a.m. today (the 25th), Song led the police to the bureau, and Guo handled the handover. As a result, Tangshan returned to its former appearance. The county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs of the counties on the eastern route also departed from Tianjin today. After the county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs arrive in Tangshan, they will take over the respective counties and bring police to maintain local order. On the northern front of Peiping, Tao Shangming and others first went to Miyun to contact Suzuki, the Japanese brigade commander, and then began the takeover. This morning at 4 a.m., Tao, along with Xu Wenquan, the county magistrate of Huairou, Sun Shutang, the county magistrate of Miyun, and Sun Weishan, the county magistrate of Ji County, and 20 security police officers, departed from Jiaodaokou inside Andingmen in a long-distance bus. Because of heavy rain in northern Peiping the night before, the roads were muddy and the bus was moving very slowly. It only passed the Qiaotou Village bus station in Huairou County at 11 a.m. The 40-mile section from Huairou to Miyun was flooded along the road, making driving even more difficult. It was not until around 2 p.m. that they reached Miyun. It was originally planned to return to Peiping this afternoon and take over Miyun and Huairou counties tomorrow, but because it was too late, they were unable to return. They should be able to return to Peiping tomorrow. According to Li Zeyi, most of the Japanese 8th Division in the Miyun area has withdrawn to the Great Wall, with only two companies remaining in Miyun. After our takeover, the Japanese troops there are expected to withdraw completely.</p>
<p>Negotiations for the opening of the Beining Railway are currently being handled by Qian Zongze. It was originally prepared to resume operations as soon as possible, but the Japanese and puppet army sides created additional complications, and it could not be realized. It has now been decided to wait until the takeover of the war zone is completed before seeking to open the railway. As for the postal service in eastern Luan, it has been fully restored. Telegrams in Qinhuangdao, Tangshan, Beidaihe, and other places have also been sent and received as usual.</p>
<p>The members of the negotiation team this time are purely Japanese, and some of them are not from the military or political circles but are compradores. Therefore, the consultations in Dalian, Tangshan, and other places are generally considered to be quite like brokerage deals and not genuine negotiations. The appointed county magistrates and public security bureau chiefs in the war zone are mostly those who can speak Japanese in order to facilitate contact with the Japanese side, and some have obtained informal consent from the other party beforehand. The war zone is essentially a buffer zone, and it remains questionable whether our side will be subject to considerable restrictions in terms of sovereignty and administration after the takeover.

<h3>Serious Famine in Northern Fujian</h3>
<p>Early Rice Crop Fails and People are Dying of Hunger</p>
<p>Various Organizations Have Taken Measures to Provide Relief</p>
<p>A dispatch from Fuzhou: Yong'an, Shaxian, Mingxi, and Qingliu counties in northern Fujian, as well as Gutian, Yongtai, Minqing, and Minhou counties near the province, have all suffered from banditry and warfare in recent years, leading to the flight of farmers, the abandonment of farmland, and a sharp reduction in rice production. In addition, this year's spring was marked by severe drought, and the early summer brought heavy rains and disasters, resulting in the failure of the early rice crop. Although rice merchants from the provincial capital have purchased and transported sea rice to provide relief, the price is high, costing more than 18 yuan per dan. Moreover, it is only sold in county towns, and poor people in the countryside can only dig up grass roots and tree bark to fill their stomachs, with people dying of hunger everywhere, a truly unbearable sight. Take the western countryside of Min County, the seat of the provincial capital, as an example. According to the survey reports of the 8th and 12th District Offices, more than 2,000 farmers in Nanting, Xuefeng, Daping, Zhuyuan, Qiangtou, Changji, Junxi, Huangpu, Luoyang, and Chayang townships are unable to cultivate and have nothing to eat. More than ten people die every day. Given that the situation is so severe in areas adjacent to the provincial capital, one can only imagine the cruel conditions in the remote counties upstream. Therefore, the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs and Relief Committee have been receiving urgent telegrams from various counties calling for help every day. There are still two months until the autumn harvest (in fact, the late rice harvest is also not very large). Without urgent relief measures, all the starving people will die of hunger. Moreover, after Peng Dehuai and Luo Binghui of the Jiangxi Communists led large groups of bandits into the Fujian border and ravaged the area, even well-off families have been bankrupted. Currently, no fewer than several thousand refugees from Jianning, Taining, Mingxi, and Qingliu counties have fled to Shunchang, Jiangle, Jian'ou, and Nanping. Due to the hot weather and lack of food, many people die every day. Several dozen representatives were specially sent to the province the day before yesterday to petition for relief funds and to establish shelters, a truly tragic situation. The Provincial Relief Committee plans to borrow funds from the banking sector and send personnel to Shanghai to purchase rice and transport it back for price stabilization. At the same time, it will request substantial funds from the central government for relief. The Provincial Government Committee also resolved yesterday to raise relief funds, organize a fundraising team, with the Chairman of the Provincial Government as the team leader, and invite Minnan leaders in various Nanyang ports and the presidents of hometown associations in various provinces to serve as team leaders and jointly raise funds for relief. The above two matters, price stabilization and relief distribution, are both in the planning stage, but have not yet been implemented. Therefore, it is difficult to predict when they can be realized. As for the relief measures in the western countryside of the provincial capital, the County Chamber of Commerce, County Government, Red Cross Society, Wanzihui, Weishan Society, Shushan Society, and other organizations have jointly established an office to assist starving people with food and are expected to raise 3,000 yuan within five days to purchase rice for distribution.

<p>Hunan Province Issues</p>
<h3>Construction Bonds of 10 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>6 Million Yuan to Build the Hongbao Light Railway</p>
<p>3 Million Yuan to Repay Old Debts to Bank of Communications</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha: Hunan Province has now decided to convert the Hongbao Highway (from Hongjiang to Baoqing) into a light railway, which is expected to require approximately 6 million yuan. However, Hunan Province's public and private finances are in dire straits and truly unable to afford this. It has invited Tang Youren, Zhang Gongquan, and others to Hunan to inspect the road administration and welcome the Shanghai banking sector to invest in Hunan. At that time, Zhang Gongquan and others stated that the Hunan provincial governments had accumulated debts of more than 3 million yuan in loans from the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, plus more than 5 million yuan in interest, and that the old debts must be paid off first before investment would be permitted. After repeated consultations between He Jian and Zhang Gongquan and others, it was decided that (1) the old debts of the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China would be allowed to be repaid with reduced interest, and (2) the Hunan Provincial Government would issue construction bonds of 10 million yuan, with approximately 3 million yuan used to repay the principal of the old debts of the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China, and the remaining 6 million yuan would be used by Zhang Gongquan and others to introduce Shanghai banks to mortgage cash as funds for the construction of the Hongbao Light Railway. Before the railway is fully completed, the deed tax and business tax revenue will be used to repay the principal and interest on a regular basis. After the railway is completed, the operating income of the railway will be used to repay the principal and interest. The "Regulations on Hunan Provincial Construction Bonds" have been drafted by the Hunan Finance and Construction Departments, submitted to He Jian for approval, and forwarded to the central government for review and promulgation. Zhang Zhongjun, the representative of the Fourth Route General Headquarters stationed in Nanjing, telegraphed that the Central Political Committee had already approved this proposal in principle. At the same time, Tang Youren's Secretary-General telegraphed that the prospects were smooth and that it could be submitted to the next Central Political Committee for resolution. The regulations are as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: The Hunan Provincial Government issues construction bonds of 10 million yuan, named Hunan Provincial Construction Bonds, to repay old bank debts, establish financial credibility, and raise funds to build the Bao Hong Light Railway.</p>
<p>Article 2: The interest rate of these bonds is set at 6% per annum.</p>

The lottery shall be held twice a year, on June 15 and December 15, and payment shall begin at the end of the same month. The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Audit shall send personnel to supervise each lottery.</p>
<p>Article 7: The number of bonds to be drawn in each lottery and the amount of principal to be redeemed shall be in accordance with the attached table.</p>
<p>Article 8: Funds for the principal and interest of these bonds shall be allocated from the Hunan Provincial deed tax and business tax revenue on a regular basis in accordance with the numbers listed in the principal and interest repayment table. If it is insufficient, it shall be permitted to allocate funds from other revenue to make up the difference.</p>
<p>Article 9: The principal and interest funds of these bonds shall be specially deposited in the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications in Shanghai, and the Hunan Provincial Bank, and shall be managed by the Fund Management Committee. The Fund Management Committee shall be composed of one person each from the provincial government and the auditing agency, as well as representatives from the Bankers' Association, the Money Industry Association, and the Chamber of Commerce. Its management rules shall be stipulated separately.</p>
<p>Article 10: The bonds are divided into three denominations: 1,000 yuan, 100 yuan, and 10 yuan, all of which are unregistered.</p>
<p>Article 11: The Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Hunan Provincial Bank shall be the managing agencies for redeeming the principal and paying the interest of these bonds.</p>
<p>Article 12: The bonds drawn in the lottery and the matured interest coupons may be used to pay all taxes in the province.</p>

<p>Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army</p>
<h3>Three Routes Launch General Offensive Against Jiangxi Bandits</h3>
<p>The First Column Advances Towards Yudu</p>
<p>The Second Column Advances Towards Huichang</p>
<p>The Third Column Advances Towards Ruijin</p>
<p>A letter from Shantou on the 21st: The Southern Route Bandit Suppression Headquarters moved to Dayuling on the 15th, with Yu Hanmou concurrently serving as the headquarters director. The bandit suppression troops on each route also advanced on different routes from the 15th, with their destinations being Yudu, Huichang, and Ruijin. It is reported that Li Zhenqiu's division of Yu Hanmou's First Column has moved from Ganzhou to Shadi, Suichuan, and Wan'an. Peng Linsheng's two regiments of Wudao garrisoned Tangjiangwei to guard against Xingguo. Ye Zhao's division was dispatched to reinforce Xinfeng, and together with Wang Zanbin's troops stationed in Sannan, they formed a unified force, assisting Li Han's troops in Nanxiong as a reserve force. Huang Zhiwen's division of Li Yangjing's Second Column was stationed in Jize, Niudouguang, and Dazhe. Huang Yanzhen's division was stationed in Pingyuan and Meixian. Huang Renhuan's division was left in Yan to garrison the line from Yingyu Brigade to Wuping to Jionglong. Another brigade went out of Wuping and Yongpingzhai to raid Luotang and join forces with Huichang Yunmenling, with Huang Yanzhen as the central route, Huang Zhiwen as the right route, and Huang Renhuan as the left route, and is now advancing towards Anyuan and Xunwu. As for the Third Column, Qu Qingnian's troops attacked Changting head-on from Longyan Baisha, guarding the area between Liancheng Luokou and Beiwei. Liu Heding's troops moved out of Taining, northern Fujian, to attack the rear of Changting as the right route. Zhang Yan's troops moved out towards Qianjiazhai, Shanghang, to attack Changting as the left route. It is reported that the Communist bandit pseudo-commander Ye Jianying has moved the pseudo-teaching regiment to Huichang, preparing to fight against the Second Column. Yang Yuchun, the pseudo-Young Pioneer Division Commander, recently surrendered to Gui Zhenyuan Brigade of Liu Heding's troops in Taining. According to his confession, "The Red Bandits are now under pressure from all sides, and all their elite troops are concentrated on the Fujian-Jiangxi border, using the terrain and mountains for defense. In February of this year, the Red Army was reorganized in Lichuan, with three army corps under the First Front Army, four divisions per army corps, three regiments per division, and one special service company. Each regiment has three infantry companies, one machine gun company, three platoons per company, three squads per platoon, and ten to twelve soldiers per squad. Each army corps has an average of more than 12,000 soldiers. The 11th Army directly under the First Front Army is in Jinxi, the 12th Army is in Guangchang Nanfeng, the 19th Army is in Changting, the 23rd Army is near Qingliu Ninghua, the 22nd Army is following the First Front Army, the Independent 1st Division is in Xunwu, the Independent 3rd Division is in Qingliu Ninghua, the Independent 4th Division is on the border of Guangchang, the Independent 7th Division is between Changting and Liancheng, and the Independent 5th Division is in the mountains of Shanghang and Wuping, all of which are composed of makeshift Red Guards and have no combat capability. The Independent Divisions are in newly occupied areas and areas adjacent to the White areas, specializing in kidnapping and looting, and are responsible for guerrilla harassment work. All their members are local ruffians." The Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army is now advancing into southern Jiangxi, and the Air Force, led by Wu Jianwen, arrived in Meixian on the 12th. Another heavy team also arrived in Meixian. On the 14th, Deputy Team Leader Ao Lun flew directly from Guangzhou to Meixian and flew to the Fujian-Jiangxi border during the day to reconnoiter and assist the various armies in suppressing the bandits.

<h3>Locusts Discovered in Various Townships of the First District</h3>
<p>Recently, locusts have suddenly been discovered in the fields of Huangtan, Yihong, Zhu Nan, and other townships in the first district of this county. The township chiefs immediately reported this to the district office, which in turn reported it to the county government. County Magistrate Yuan believes that the work of controlling locusts brooks no delay, and he personally led the township chiefs of the district to various townships yesterday morning to supervise and encourage the farmers to do their best to capture the locusts, resulting in the capture of five large sacks of locusts. While capturing the locusts, he distributed simple methods for preventing and eliminating locusts along the way, advising farmers to unite and eliminate the locusts in a timely manner to prevent future troubles.</p>
<h3>Old Man Rapes Six-Year-Old Girl</h3>
<p>Gu, who lives in the Qimiao area of the Fifth District and is nearly fifty years old and makes a living as a bucket maker, took advantage of the absence of his neighbor Xia the night before and forcibly raped his six-year-old daughter. When Xia returned home, the daughter immediately cried and screamed in pain. Xia reported this to the Nicheng Public Security Substation, which dispatched police to arrest Gu. He also took his daughter to the Public First Hospital in the city overnight to request medical treatment. After examination by the doctor, the girl's private parts were found to be seriously injured. Yesterday, the substation presented Gu to the County Public Security Bureau for transfer to the county government for interrogation and prosecution. Suzhou</p>

<h3>The Dispute over Rice Industry Discounts Remains Unresolved</h3>
<p>The County Chamber of Commerce of this county, in order to resolve the dispute over rice and bean discounts, specially invited 18 representatives of the eight rice industry sections, including Zhao Zixin, Li Zhongchen, and Tao Yinfu, to a meeting at the chamber yesterday to discuss a solution. Chairman Yang Xichun solicited the opinions of the representatives, and each representative spoke in succession based on their position and stated their reasons. As a result, the Chamber of Commerce proposed a compromise plan to overturn the 99 discount and the 984 discount and change it to a 987 discount. The opinions in the Sanliqiao section were somewhat accepting, while the attitude in the Beitang section was still extremely firm, with the aim of maintaining the original plan of 99 discount throughout. Finally, it was decided that the Chamber of Commerce would inform the Rice and Bean Industry Association to convene a general meeting of the industry immediately to properly plan a unified solution in order to avoid disputes and stabilize the business.</p>

<h3>Rice Stem Borers and Locusts Discovered in Shazhou</h3>
<p>There has been no rain for a long time, and the drought is rampant. The farmland irrigation almost nowhere to draw water. The rice fields in Shazhou City in the Fourth District here, because the land is newly formed and naturally fertile, have abundant harvests. This year, due to the drought, rice stem borers and locusts have suddenly been discovered. It is observed that their momentum is spreading from Jiangbei. Zhu Qingnan, the district chief of the district, has reported this to the county government and has already issued a notice to all townships to take proper precautions and to do their best to eliminate the locusts in the affected townships.</p>
<h3>Unidentified Male Corpse Discovered in Heyang</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 25th) afternoon, a male corpse was discovered in Shandong Tangwan, Heyang Township, Fifth District, wearing a blue and white short shirt and trousers. It appeared to have been drowned for a long time, so its face was blurred. It is said that this corpse was a fugitive in a major case, or a person who committed suicide out of fear of punishment. Xu, the district chief, has reported this to the county government, and it has been decided to send personnel to the countryside on the 26th for an autopsy.</p>

<h3>Inferior Son's Robbery Implicates Elderly Mother</h3>
<p>In Lane 11, Daogjia Lane, Chaosui Ditch, a local resident, Old Mrs. Gao, is over sixty years old and has no children. A nephew, Chen Zhaoyuan, lives with his wife in Old Mrs. Gao's house. Chen used to work as a tea server on the Yuantai tugboat of the Tiantai Company but is now unemployed. Next door to Old Mrs. Gao lives Old Mrs. Yuan, who is in her fifties and became a widow at a young age, relying on her own labor to make a living and raise her son, Jiaxiang. She recommended him to work in a lumber business in Bengbu, but he was later dismissed due to poor conduct and returned to town. It was reported that someone knocked on the Gao residence last night, claiming to deliver a telegram from Hankou. Chen Zhaoyuan's wife opened the door, and Yuan and two others immediately entered. They forced Chen Zhaoyuan's wife into a water tank, but Chen desperately pulled his wife out. They were frightened and dared not make a sound. Yuan then entered the room and searched around the windows, but found nothing. Yuan and the other two then snatched a gold necklace from Old Mrs. Gao's neck and fled with shouts. However, two robbers were captured by patrol officers at the southern entrance of Chaosui Ditch and were sent to the Fourth Branch of the Provincial Public Security Bureau. It was revealed that one was named Ji Chun and the other Yang Zhigao. It was said that one was a tea server at a bathhouse. The bureau prepared a document to send the two robbers to the General Bureau for legal action, and Old Mrs. Yuan was taken to the bureau and ordered to hand over her son. Yuan's residence was also sealed off.</p>
<h3>Wheat Prices in Jiangbei Expected to Rise</h3>
<p>This year, the second wheat crop in Jiangbei, Jiangsu Province, had a bumper harvest, but the market price was extremely low. Top-quality Yuhua wheat was only selling for four yuan per stone, the next best for three yuan and fifty cents, and the rest for three yuan. Therefore, farmers were invariably worried. The farmers' associations in various counties sent telegrams to the provincial government, requesting the lifting of restrictions on grain exports, so that the surplus wheat in Jiangbei could be transported to other places for sale to regulate the market. Since this month, many farmers in Jiangbei have been transporting accumulated wheat to Anhui Province and various places south of the Yangtze River in this province via the Huai and Yun waterways. At the same time, major flour companies in Wuhan, Shanghai, Tianjin, and other places are also actively purchasing Yuhua wheat, causing the price to rise from four yuan to seven yuan. The next best also rose to six yuan and twenty cents, and the rest rose from three yuan to five yuan and sixty cents. Farmers in rural areas, seeing the active grain market and high prices, are transporting their accumulated wheat to the market. In a few days, grain merchants from distant places will come to purchase wheat, and prices are expected to rise further. Farmers in Jiangbei may have a chance to catch their breath.</p>

<h3>Antiquities Discovered in Lianjie Island</h3>
<p>Lianjie Island in the third district of the county belongs to the collapsed river area. The ancient tombs there are all being relocated. A bone collector named Zhou Huawen recently found two pairs of jade bracelets, thirteen ancient porcelain bowls of various sizes, and eight ancient copper coins in a pile of bones in an ancient pit in the area. It is said that the jade bracelets are Han jade, and the porcelain bowls are from the Longquan kiln. However, the ancient coins are too eroded to identify the dynasty.</p>

<h3>Contracted School Land Causes Disputes</h3>
<p>The public Wu Zhuang school land, jointly owned by the education bureaus of six counties, Huai'an, Huaiyin, Lianshui, Siyang, Yancheng, and Funing, and the Huai'an Provincial Middle School, was originally donated by the late Huai'an gentry Ding Hengfu. Since Ma You'an, Li Youbin, Shao Zizhen, Liu Zhenqing, Xue Zhong'an, and others contracted the land rent, disputes have arisen over the accounts. Last year, a lawsuit was filed due to the accounts, which was settled after mediation by many people. This year, the contractor Ma You'an again violated the agreement and sold the stored rice in the granary without authorization. This was discovered by the other four shareholders, who also found items such as an axe used by Ma to damage the granary door. Dissatisfied, in addition to holding a shareholders' meeting to study the matter, they filed a lawsuit according to law yesterday, requesting the county to recover the losses.</p>

<h3>Regulations for the Provisional Land Value Tax in This City</h3>
<p>The regulations have been approved and promulgated by the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Government decided to levy land value tax, it immediately ordered the Land and Finance Bureaus to organize a preparatory committee for the land value tax to begin preparing all the procedures for collection. At the same time, it submitted the collection regulations and the organizational rules of the valuation committee to the Executive Yuan for approval. The Executive Yuan passed the regulations at its 107th meeting and sent them to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan approved the regulations at its 25th meeting of the Third Session, deciding that they could be implemented provisionally before the promulgation of the Land Law Enforcement Law. However, because the regulations are temporary, they did not need to go through legislative procedures and were returned to the Executive Yuan by the Legislative Yuan, which then ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to promulgate them. The Municipal Government received the order from the Executive Yuan yesterday, and in addition to notifying the Land and Finance Bureaus, it is also promulgating the regulations and rules as follows:</p>
<h3>Provisional Land Value Tax Regulations for Shanghai Municipality</h3>
<p>(Article 1) All land within the commercial areas of this city shall be subject to provisional land value tax in accordance with these regulations before the promulgation of the Land Law Enforcement Law. The boundaries of the commercial areas shall be separately delineated and announced. (Article 2) The following land shall be exempt from provisional land value tax: (1) Land owned by the city; (2) Land used for public welfare and charitable purposes without any income, which has been approved for tax exemption by the Municipal Government. (Article 3) The provisional land value tax shall be paid by the owner of the land as registered with the Land Bureau. If the land is held under a perpetual lease, the tax shall be paid by the holder of the perpetual lease. However, if the land is subject to a pledge, mortgage, or fixed-term lease, the pledger, mortgagee, or fixed-term lessee may be required to pay the tax on behalf of the owner when necessary. (Article 4) The provisional land value tax rate shall be six per thousand of the assessed land value per year. (Article 5) The provisional land value tax shall be collected in two installments each year. The first installment shall be collected from January 1st to the end of February, and the second installment shall be collected from July 1st to the end of August. The Finance Bureau shall be responsible for the collection. (Article 6) The Land Bureau shall first inspect the topography and current market price of the land, and shall also refer to the land value reported by the owners to divide the land into land value zones. These zones shall be submitted to the Provisional Land Value Tax Land Valuation Committee for review, and then jointly announced by the Finance and Land Bureaus. If the owners have any objections to the announced land value, they may state their reasons and apply to the Land Bureau within the prescribed time limit for submission to an arbitrator. The regulations for the aforementioned Valuation Committee shall be separately determined. (Article 7) The collection of the provisional land value tax shall not be suspended due to an application for arbitration of the land value, but the land value shall be determined in accordance with the decision of the land value arbitrator. (Article 8) If the provisional land value tax is not paid by the due date, it shall be deemed as tax arrears and may be subject to prosecution and collection. In addition, a surcharge of five percent per annum shall be added to the amount owed, starting from the day following the expiration of the collection period. If the arrears remain unpaid for three years, the collecting agency may submit a request to the Municipal Government for approval to auction the land and its fixtures to offset the tax arrears. The remaining funds shall be returned to the original tax defaulter. (Article 9) The original land tax and surcharges shall be abolished for land that has already been subject to the provisional land value tax. (Article 10) Land within the provisional land value tax area shall be subject to land value tax regardless of whether it has been surveyed. However, if the land has not been surveyed and the certificate has not been exchanged, the land tax shall be collected temporarily, and a provisional receipt shall be issued. After the survey and certificate exchange, the tax shall be supplemented. The owner may apply to the Land Bureau to verify the receipt and deduct the amount paid. (Article 11) When land subject to the provisional land value tax is sold, the transfer tax shall be levied at two percent of the current market price, but the land appreciation tax and inheritance tax to be levied in the future when handling land transfers shall be</p>
<h3>The Situation in the Chahar Bureau is Relaxing</h3>
<p>The government still holds peaceful intentions</p>
<p>Mr. Feng also has considerable sincerity</p>
<p>Regarding the Chahar Bureau issue, according to information obtained from various sources in this city, the situation is not as tense as it was a few days ago. Due to mediation by various parties, although the central government has sent the 11th Division into Chahar, it still hopes to handle the matter peacefully. Therefore, the division that entered Chahar only stayed in the Xiahuayuan area and did not advance further. Mr. Feng has also expressed considerable sincerity to the central government, only seeking what is beneficial to the country. The accurate information obtained by the reporter is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Resolution by the Highest Authority</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the reporter visited a central committee member and asked about the central government's true attitude towards the Chahar Bureau. According to the committee member, although the central government sent troops into Chahar some time ago, it seems that it will take effective measures to resolve the issue. However, it does not want to repeat the fratricide and become a laughingstock internationally, so it still holds peaceful intentions and hopes to achieve a satisfactory resolution. Judging from the latest situation, this matter will be transferred to the central government's highest authority for discussion and resolution, because both Feng Yuxiang and Fang Zhenwu are members of the current central committee.</p>
<h3>Li Liejun's Talk</h3>
<p>The reporter also visited Mr. Li Liejun, a member of the Central Committee staying in Shanghai. Mr. Li said that regarding the Chahar Bureau issue, the members of the Central Committee staying in Shanghai had entrusted Mr. Wen to go to Chahar some time ago. Mr. Wen is an advisor to the Nanchang camp and has now arrived in Zhangjiakou. According to Mr. Wen's telegrams, Mr. Feng still adheres to the principles of "peace, unity, solidarity, and resistance against foreign aggression" and has never wavered. The rumors that Mr. Feng has turned communist are definitely untrue, and there are no slogans opposing the central government. As for the military and civilians, they get along very well. Mr. Li also said that, in short, the Chahar Bureau issue can be resolved satisfactorily after further negotiations by various leaders.</p>
<p>Yesterday</p>
<h3>Inspection of Ancient Artifacts from the Forbidden City</h3>
<p>They were neither damp nor moldy</p>
<p>Inspection will continue today and tomorrow</p>
<p>Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, members of the Provisional Supervisory Committee, together with staff from the Palace Museum, began the inspection. It was stipulated that the inspection time would be from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM in the morning and from 1:30 PM to 4:00 PM in the afternoon. The Supervisory Committee originally planned to hold a meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon, but it was temporarily changed to 5:00 PM and held at the Albert Building. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Personnel Present</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, around 9:00 AM, the inspection began. The attendees included Supervisory Committee members Zhou Ren, Chen Rui, Huang Peng, Yu Tongkui (representing Zhou Huanxuan), and Ma Heng (Director of the Museum and ex officio member), among others. Some of the supervisory committee members in the North Sichuan Road storage had not arrived. Others included Zhuang Shangyan, Li Yihua, Huang Pengyou, Song Jilong, Tang Youen, Zhu Deming, Zhang Mingtao, Fang Xinghui, Zhang Deze, Na Zhiliang, Liang Tingwei, Wu Yuzhang, and other responsible inspection personnel. Many of them were staff members of the Palace Museum, because the supervisors only served as supervisors, while the work of checking, opening boxes, packing boxes, and sunning had to be carried out by the museum staff.</p>
<h3>Inspection Results</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, box-opening inspections were carried out. The inspection personnel were divided into five groups, each with eleven people. In the afternoon, the inspection personnel were divided into six groups, each with twelve people. The procedures were meticulous, and the security was very strict. The results of the inspection showed that the ancient artifacts in the boxes were neither damp nor moldy. The monitors were greatly pleased. Afterwards, the staff carefully resealed everything as it was, and each supervisor was invited to sign on top to show solemnity.</p>
<h3>Supervisory Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon around 5:00 PM, all the supervisors gathered at the Albert Building for a meeting. They all agreed to continue the inspection today and tomorrow. If all the circumstances were the same as yesterday, they decided not to continue the inspection. They also formally suggested at the meeting to expand the organization of the Provisional Supervisory Committee. In addition to the existing Executive Yuan, Military Affairs Commission, Academia Sinica, Municipal Council, Local Court, and Palace Museum, they plan to add the Municipal Party Department and other relevant institutions and legal entities for joint supervision to demonstrate fairness. Various Trade Associations</p>
<h3>Requesting Special Amnesty for Liu Chongwu and Others</h3>
<p>Hao Peng's Release Should Not Reverse Merits and Punishments</p>
<p>Please Follow the Precedent of the Zheng Jicheng Case to Encourage Patriots</p>
<p>The various trade associations of this city, in order to rescue the patriotic actions of Liu Chongwu and others, have jointly petitioned the Central Political Committee, the Executive Yuan, and the Judicial Yuan, requesting a special amnesty be granted according to the precedent of Zheng Jicheng of Shandong, so as to encourage the actions of patriots and deter the courage of petty criminals. The original petition is recorded below: A petition for a request. Since Japan has been poisoning Liaoning and Shenyang and further occupying the four northeastern provinces, people with blood and Qi are furious and think of refusing to use and sell their goods, in order to reduce its trade with China and express the accumulated resentment of the world, showing a lesson to</p>
<p>One in ten thousand. However, there are greedy villains everywhere. The enemy uses cheap dumping as bait, and treacherous merchants take advantage of breaking the covenant. The act of acting as an accomplice to a tiger should be punished in the same way as helping the enemy and betraying the country. However, due to the country's weakness, the resistance war is limited to military strength, and the punishment of traitors is limited by diplomacy. Therefore, patriots rise up and organize themselves, hoping to use drastic actions to deal with treacherous merchants. However, their original intention is only to warn and does not necessarily want to harm their lives. Therefore, the result of the outbreak of such incidents is not as serious as the announcement, which is enough to prove that in punishing traitors, they still have a loyal and compassionate heart. On November 28, 1932, Liu Chongwu, Pan Hongsheng, Zeng Songshou, and others were arrested by the public concession patrol for warning Deyuanchang Foreign Goods Store. The case was litigated in the First District Court of the Special Zone. After research, it was considered that the previous Maochangxin and other cases were related to the defendants, so the defendants were sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment for jointly plotting to murder. Tian Shuiyang, who participated in Deyuanchang, was considered to have helped plot murder and was sentenced to six years of imprisonment by the court. We believe that the case of Liu Chongwu and others is similar to the case of patriotic youth in Beiping City assassinating Zhang Jingyao this year. Both are for the purpose of punishing traitors. However, in terms of the degree of harm, one is a deliberate conspiracy, and the other is only a warning. There is a difference in weight. However, after the Zhang assassination case in Beiping City, the court did not prosecute the patriotic youth. It can be seen that in criminal prosecution, the prosecutor should take the interests of the country as a prerequisite and have the freedom to plant and choose. The case of Liu Chongwu is located in the public concession, and the prosecutor has the right to prosecute, and is organized by foreigners. Of course, it cannot take into account the national policy. Since the mistake has already been made in the first place, it can only be remedied by special amnesty afterwards. We have inquired that in the case of Zheng Jicheng in Shandong, although the defendant had righteous indignation, it was still a family feud. After the court sentenced him according to law, he was still granted a special amnesty by government order. In the case of Liu Chongwu and others, their actions resulted in killing and injury, and the motive was purely to eliminate traitors for the country. It was not a private resentment or family feud. In terms of their bright hearts, they are even above Zheng Jicheng. Briefly looking at the case, they should be pardoned. Otherwise, if Hao Peng's betrayal of the motherland, with the words of a Japanese, is both tied and released, the patriots who eliminate traitors for the country will be imprisoned because of adhering to official opinions. This makes those who surrender to the enemy rewarded, and those who are loyal to the country punished. If the punishment is reversed and the people's hearts are exhausted, how can the country stand on the earth? Therefore, without considering the boldness, we beg that your court approves and grants a special amnesty according to the example of Zheng Jicheng, so that righteous people can still strive, and petty criminals will know the fear, which is really convenient for the public.

<p>China Table Tennis Company</p>
<h3>Also Warned to Relocate</h3>
<p>Negotiations by the Confederation of Mechanical Industries Granted Postponement Yi Yuan Stops Production Labor-Capital Dispute Resolved</p>
<p>Other Factories All Improve Automatically</p>
<p>Since the nine rubber factories of Yi Yuan, Tian Xing, Da De, Hong Da, Zheng Da, Shanghai Industrial, Da Zhonghua, Yi Sheng First, and Yi Sheng Second, and the Meiya Silk Weaving Factory No. 9 were illegally interfered with by the British and French Boards of Works, warned to stop work and relocate, the cases are still pending. Now, the China Table Tennis Company has also been warned by the Public Concession Board of Works and given a deadline to relocate. Currently, except for Yi Yuan Factory, which has automatically relocated, Da Zhonghua, Yi Sheng First, and Yi Sheng Second have all improved one after another. The China Table Tennis Company, in addition to improving, has been granted a six-month postponement by the Board of Works after negotiations by the Confederation of Mechanical Industries. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Warning Measures</h3>
<p>The China Table Tennis Company at No. 19, Lane 849, Youheng Road, Hongkou, recently received a warning from the Public Concession Board of Works and was notified of the following measures to be modified: (1) Move the boiler inwards; (2) Build walls on three sides to ensure safety, and open a door to the outside for ventilation; (3) Keep the emergency exit open; (4) Rewire the electric lights; (5) Do not build tents in the corridor; (6) Do not store goods near the factory. These six items must be implemented within three weeks; otherwise, it must be relocated immediately.</p>
<h3>Postponement Granted</h3>
<p>After receiving the warning, the China Table Tennis Company immediately reported to the Shanghai Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Factories, requesting a protest. The Federation, upon receiving the report, sent Secretary-General Cheng Shouzhong to negotiate with the Board of Works. He was received by Mr. Hunter, a Westerner from the Fire Department. After repeated negotiations, the Bureau finally agreed to a six-month postponement. The Confederation also supplemented the conditions of the Board of Works: (1) Install lead skin on the roof; (2) Prepare emergency sand to prevent accidents; (3) Broken celluloid and debris should be placed in iron buckets. The company is also planning to rebuild a new house and is actively submitting the house plans to the Board of Works for approval.</p>
<h3>Automatic Improvement</h3>
<p>After the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory at No. 1102, Xujiahui Road, was ordered by the French Concession Board of Works to relocate the boiler, the Bureau agreed to a postponement after repeated negotiations by the factory with the French Board of Works. After the Yi Sheng First Factory at No. 83, Binlang Road, and the Yi Sheng Second Factory at No. 31, Binlang Road, were given nine relocation conditions by the Board of Works, the factories reported to the Rubber Industry Association and the Confederation of Mechanical Industries for negotiations. The factories gradually reformed the conditions proposed by the Bureau and reported them to the Board of Works for record. Therefore, no problems arose.</p>
<h3>Yi Yuan Solved</h3>
<p>After Yi Yuan Factory at No. 1002, North Chengdu Road, was forced to close down, all the workers were transferred by the Social Affairs Bureau to resolve the following measures: (1) Yi Yuan Rubber Factory is forced to relocate and is allowed to temporarily suspend work for three months from July 1; (2) During the suspension period, the capital will subsidize each person 3 yuan per month for food expenses, and pre-borrow 2 yuan per month. The pre-borrowed wages will be deducted by the capital from the wages after work resumes; (3) Food expenses and pre-borrowed wages for July and August will be paid once on August 3, and wages for September will be paid on September 3. After the labor and capital parties were satisfied, they signed and resolved the matter. Tian Xing at No. 108, Lane 58, Qiqihar Road, Da De at Nos. 18-30, Lane 1222, Kunming Road, Zheng Da at No. 884, Taopeng Road, and Shanghai Industrial at the corner of Youheng Road, East Fair Road have also automatically modified their facilities and have sent separate letters to the Board of Works for inspection.</p>
<h3>Petition for Negotiation</h3>
<p>In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Federation of Machine-Made National Goods Factories also petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday to directly protest to the Board of Works. At the same time, it sent personnel to various domestic goods manufacturers to inspect and provide guidance on any improprieties to avoid the recurrence of similar incidents. The Rubber Industry Association also plans to petition the Municipal Government for negotiations.</p>

<h3>Fly North After Changing the Motor</h3>
<p>Zeng Yijing Dined Chen Shilin and Pan Dingxin Last Night</p>
<p>Mr. Chen Shilin, Director of the Aviation Office of the Xiamen Navy, and Mr. Pan Dingxin, Chief of the Mechanical Section, came to Shanghai in the self-made Jiangque land plane, which safely landed at Hongqiao the other day. Yesterday, a reporter from Guowen News Agency visited Mr. Zeng Yijing, Director of the Wooden Ship Navy Aircraft Manufacturing Office. He said that the departure date of Director Chen has not</p>
<p>The larger motor is flying to North China. Generally, he will leave Shanghai after changing the motor. During his stay in Shanghai, Mr. Chen plans to visit major factories in Shanghai. If the products of each factory are suitable for aircraft, they will be adopted as aircraft manufacturing materials, etc. It was later learned that Mr. Chen was staying at a friend's place. Last night, Mr. Zeng Yijing hosted a dinner for Mr. Chen and Mr. Pan at the Naval Recreation Club on Luban Road.</p>
<h3>Information on the Negotiation of the Tiānchú Airplane</h3>
<p>The seller has agreed to ship the plane back.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The all-metal fighter plane ordered by the Tiānchú Monosodium Glutamate Factory in this city from the Junkers factory in Germany was assembled at the Hóngqiáo Airport. During the initial test flight, the pilot was careless and damaged two wheels and the propeller during descent. Because the initial test flight resulted in damage to the plane, Tiānchú Factory believed the responsibility should fall on the seller. Therefore, they negotiated through two letters, requesting a new plane. Zen Shing &amp; Co., the agent handling the plane, immediately telegraphed the German factory to report the incident. The German side replied by dispatching someone nearby to investigate the truth and determine responsibility, as the factory and the agent company are still in negotiation. However, according to inquiries with the person in charge of Tiānchú Factory, Zen Shing &amp; Co. has already replied, not denying responsibility for the damage, but requesting that the damaged plane be shipped back before a new one is sent. Tiānchú Factory, however, fears that the German factory will take the damaged plane away, repair and repaint it, and then ship the same plane back. The damage to the parts would not be noticeable to non-experts, which could cause problems during future use. Therefore, the factory is still considering whether to accept the seller's request.</p>

<h3>Mayor Wú Welcomes Sūn Tónggāng to Shanghai</h3>
<p>Mayor Wú Tiěchéng telegraphed Sūn Tónggāng the day before yesterday, stating: Secretary Fāng Xīkǒng of the Central Party Headquarters in Nánjīng conveyed to Mr. Sūn Tónggāng that your return to the country from Europe and long-distance flight have brought glory to the nation. I am sending this telegram to welcome you to Shanghai, so that people here may have the honor of seeing you. Please let me know the date of your arrival beforehand. Respectfully, Wú Tiěchéng to the families of the victims of the Tú Nán incident.</p>
<h3>Petitioning the Bureau for Increased Compensation</h3>
<p>Making a Ruckus in the General Affairs Department</p>
<p>Dispersed by Police Detectives</p>
<p>The families of the victims of the Tú Nán Wheel, a vessel of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (Zhāo Shāng Jú), have already been compensated by the company with one year's salary. Those whose compensation is less than 500 yuan will have the difference made up by the Jūn ān Association. However, some of the families, at the request of the Preparatory Office of the Seamen's Union, are seeking compensation of 1,000 yuan per deceased seaman and recognition of their children's education expenses. They initially requested this from the bureau through the Victims' Relief Committee, but the bureau did not respond. As a result, yesterday morning, a large group of seamen's families went to the bureau to petition, and damaged property. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Families Arrive at the Bureau to Petition</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 10:45 AM, more than 30 family members of the victims of the Tú Nán Wheel, mostly women, some with children, hired three moving trucks and went to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to petition for increased compensation. They first went to the Business Department to negotiate. The bureau staff stated that the matter was being handled by the General Affairs Department and was not under the jurisdiction of the Business Department. The families then rushed to the second floor to the General Affairs Department, crying and making a commotion. Several men even forced their way into the General Affairs Department office. Since no one from the department was there to negotiate with the families, and no representatives came forward to present their case, they simply shouted and wailed, lying on the floor.</p>
<h3>Damaging Public Property Inside the Bureau</h3>
<p>Seeing that the bureau staff ignored them, several of the petitioners entered the office and threw all the items on the desks onto the ground. They also smashed a coffee table, broke two panes of the department's glass windows, and damaged lamps and other small items. The department staff immediately came out to stop them and advised them to leave the office and wait for the General Manager's decision.</p>
<h3>Police Disperse the Crowd</h3>
<p>During the crying, commotion, and destruction, the General Affairs Department reported to Liú Hóngshēng for instructions. General Manager Liú then ordered Shǐ Wéijùn and other officials of the bureau's General Services to negotiate with the families, asking them to elect representatives to present their case and not to cause trouble and damage property. The families stated that they were requesting an increase in compensation to 1,000 yuan per person. The bureau's police, fearing trouble, immediately reported to the Fourth Avenue Police Station. At around 11:00 AM, a large group of police arrived and dispersed the troublemaking men, women, and children from the bureau, taking those who had damaged property into custody. They were released by the police after 12:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Seamen's Union Discusses</h3>
<p>The bureau provides compensation of 500 yuan per deceased worker, as has been the practice in past incidents, and has not been stingy. Compared to other shipping companies, this is considered a preferential treatment. Now, the families are petitioning for increased compensation and also requesting education expenses, which is considered an excessive demand. The bureau officials could only offer reassurances and promised to reply after consulting with the Preparatory Office of the Seamen's Union. Yesterday, General Manager Liú dispatched personnel to the Preparatory Office of the Seamen's Union to discuss the matter. It is reported that the seamen's families also went to the Seamen's Union to request their assistance.</p>
<p>Abolish the Steamboat Comprador System</p>
<h3>China Merchants Begins Pilot Implementation</h3>
<p>Replacing Business Agents with Stewards on the Pǔ ān and Xīn Míng</p>
<p>Decides to Hire Foreign Instructors to Teach Specialized Subjects</p>
<p>In China, steamboats have traditionally entrusted the cargo handling and passenger service aspects to business agents (compradors), who are not managed by the shipowners. This abnormal system is unheard of in the global shipping industry. As a result, the authority of the crew and business affairs is separated. Furthermore, an excessive number of stewards and servants are hired, which hinders navigation and disturbs passengers. Therefore, the Ministry of Communications has ordered Shanghai-based national steamboats to abolish this comprador system. China Merchants has already taken the lead in implementing this, but due to the significant impact, it will start with a pilot program.</p>
<h3>Ministry Orders Abolition of Compradors</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Communications believes that in any country around the world, commercial ships, whether for cargo or passengers, are under the overall jurisdiction of the shipowner. The responsibility and duties are assigned to the chief and second mates. There are no separate compradors responsible for cargo handling and passenger tickets. Therefore, the authority on the ship can be unified, and the shipowner is fully responsible for the entire ship. Other crew members are responsible to the shipowner. Only in China, whether on ships in the Yangtze River or coastal waters, are compradors hired in addition to the crew. These compradors can freely collect security deposits or guarantees, and excessively hire stewards. Since these stewards receive no salary, they are forced to solicit tips and alcohol money from passengers. For example, stewards on Ningbo steamboats even hire assistants, who demand excessive fees, often leading to disputes. Often, the number of stewards on a ship exceeds the total number of crew members. Tracing the cause, it is all due to the comprador system. Therefore, reforming shipping affairs must start with abolishing this comprador system. The Ministry has ordered all Chinese-owned steamships in Shanghai to comply.</p>
<h3>China Merchants Tries New System</h3>
<p>China Merchants is now state-owned. Reforming shipping affairs is its leading role. After receiving the Ministry of Communications' instructions, General Manager Liú Hóngshēng immediately discussed with the heads of various departments the abolition of the system where compradors contract for business on the steamships. The company will take back the passenger ticketing business and handle it themselves. Zhào Yúntái, the head of the Shipping Department, had proposed this idea early on, but due to various obstacles, it could not be fully implemented immediately. After discussion, it was decided to use the company's top-tier coastal ships, Pǔ ān and Xīn Míng, as model ships for abolishing the comprador system and breaking the system of contracting for business. The company will re-establish the duties and responsibilities of the ship's internal operations and add a steward to each ship to be responsible for passenger affairs and the cleanliness and hygiene of the entire ship. Passenger tickets will be reported and accounted for accurately, and the authority will belong to the head office. On the ship, the steward will be under the jurisdiction of the captain.</p>
<h3>Training New Talent</h3>
<p>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company General Manager Liú Hóngshēng believes that abolishing compradors is imperative, but there is a lack of specialized talent to manage passenger services and maintain the cleanliness of the entire ship. Since the new system was implemented on the Pǔ ān and Xīn Míng ships, the results have been mediocre. Therefore, Mr. Liú proposed to the board of directors that training be given to service personnel and specialized Westerners be hired to teach trainees in the bureau, in order to prepare them for deployment on various ships to implement the new system. The proposal stated that in compliance with the Ministry's order to abolish compradors on various ships, the Pǔ ān and Xīn Míng ships were already being piloted. However, many of the company's river and sea ships still use the comprador system. The heads of each business are too focused on business matters and pay little attention to the various facilities and hygiene and cleanliness inside the ship, which leads to passenger dissatisfaction. The new river and sea ships that the company purchased with British Boxer Indemnity funds will arrive in Shanghai and begin service next spring. These new ships will, of course, follow the new system and not use business agents. However, China lacks specialized talent in shipping affairs and must train people in time to serve on the ships. The company should hire one or two specialized Westerners in shipping affairs to recruit trainees within the bureau, who will be taught the knowledge of ship management to replace the compradors. The board of directors has already approved General Manager Liú's proposal to hire specialized Westerners to train specialized talent in the bureau.</p>
<h3>Panic Among Stewards</h3>
<p>The Xīn Míng ship is a top-tier vessel on the North Sea route, and it has many stewards and servants. After the resignation of Business Manager Xie, the bureau took over the cargo handling and passenger ticketing services and stopped assigning business agents. Instead, a new system was being tested, and Mr. Chen was appointed as steward, reporting directly to the bureau. However, most of the ship's stewards have paid security deposits and were hired by the former business agent. They also do not receive wages and rely entirely on collecting tips from passengers for their livelihood. There are many of them. Now, it is heard that the bureau is changing the system and plans to change the stewards to a wage system, not collecting security deposits, limiting the number of stewards, and prohibiting them from soliciting tips from passengers. The stewards on the ship are panicking because they are worried about the reduction in the number of positions and the impact on their livelihood. Yesterday morning, they sent representatives to the bureau to inquire, but there has been no news.</p>

<h3>Gāo Yīhán Arrives in Bǎoshān to Inspect the Seawall</h3>
<p>Gāo Yīhán, a supervisory committee member of the Supervisory Yuan, arrived in Bǎoshān yesterday afternoon to inspect the seawall. He was accompanied by Magistrate Jīn, Wǎn Zhīrèn, and local figures such as Táo Yúnshí. At around 4:00 PM, they returned to the city. Representatives from various agencies and local figures held a meeting at the Custody of Abandoned Properties to welcome him and presented him with a summary of their concerns. Wáng Zòuyún and Pān Mèngqiào, members of the seawall protection committee, and Liú Pǔzhēn, a member of the Party Committee, successively described the dangerous condition of the seawall. The autumn floods and high tides are imminent, and if substantial funds are not allocated for preventive measures, the consequences will be unimaginable. Once the seawall collapses, the disaster will be even worse than the floods in Hánkǒu and Gāoyóu in previous years. Supervisory Committee Member Gāo replied, explaining that the Central Government is paying close attention to the seawall and is working on securing funds as a fundamental solution. The immediate need is a temporary solution, and the provincial government has agreed to allocate more than 40,000 yuan first. Those present repeatedly asked Supervisory Committee Member Gāo to urge the provincial government to expedite the allocation. The meeting adjourned at nearly 6:00 PM. It is reported that he will also visit Sōngjiāng, Tàicāng, and other places to inspect the seawalls before returning to Nánjīng to report.</p>

<h3>Sū's Troops Have Been Completely Repatriated</h3>
<p>The 112 dependents of General Sū Bǐngwén, including men and women, were housed in two properties rented by the joint association of charitable organizations in this city at No. 3 and No. 25 Cǎishòu Lane, Jùlài Dá Road. After Sū arrived in Shanghai, the dependents were gradually sent to Běipíng and Hāěrbīn by ship and train. This repatriation has now been completed. The remaining dependents of Wáng Délín, apart from the 16 people sent away a few days ago, include more than 120 men and women living at No. 8 Hénglè Lane, Pǔshí Road, French Concession, and No. 5, Workers' Housing, Dàxīng Fāng, as well as 35 dependents of Lǐ Dù living at No. 17 Cǎishòu Lane. It is now known that the three-month lease period for the houses on Pǔshí Road and Dàxīng Fāng has long expired. However, Wáng recently sent a letter from Hong Kong to the charitable organizations in this city, requesting that the dependents not be moved before he arrives in Shanghai, so as to avoid displacement. Therefore, the charitable organizations will move all the dependents of Wáng and Lǐ to the Cǎishòu Lane properties on Jùlài Dá Road for temporary housing.</p>

The committee will begin operations immediately. The address is attached to the Bureau of Navigation.</p>
<h3>The Question of the Existence of the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>Mayor Wú Did Not Discuss This with Chairman Jiang</p>
<p>Since Dài Jí, the commander of the Songhu Garrison, was transferred to the position of member of the Fujian Provincial Committee and concurrently Director of Civil Affairs, there has been speculation regarding the succession of the commander of the Garrison Headquarters or the question of its continued existence. Outside sources say that because Shanghai has a Security Office responsible for defense, the Garrison Headquarters is no longer necessary. It is said that Shanghai Mayor Wú Tiěchéng had already discussed this with Chairman Jiang during his previous visit to Jiangxi. This reporter specifically visited Mayor Wú yesterday to ask if he had already discussed the matter of abolishing the Songhu Garrison Headquarters and assigning all Songhu defense duties to the Security Force with Chairman Jiang. Mayor Wú replied that he had not discussed this matter with Chairman Jiang during his previous visit to Jiangxi. Therefore, he did not know whether the Garrison Headquarters would be abolished or who would succeed him. The Central Government will issue a clear announcement in the future.</p>

<h3>National Products Production and Sales Joint Corporation</h3>
<p>A New Front Line for Saving the Nation through Production</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident (9/18) National Crisis, the people of China, in their pain and indignation, have deeply understood that in this era of economic struggle, unless they strive for production and strengthen national power, it is impossible to talk about seeking survival and avenging humiliation. Therefore, promoting national products and building industries have become the common goals of patriotic people. This is why the Shanghai National Products Company and the China National Products Company were able to become bulwarks on Nanjing Road after the national crisis, protecting the economy from outflow. However, national products companies are only a type of organization to assist in the promotion of national products and are not sufficient to create an organization that allows the production and sales sides to have full mutual assistance and full cooperation. Thus, the ideal of organizing a joint national products production and sales organization has become a demand in the advocacy of saving the nation through production. The representatives of various provinces who went to the United States in May to participate in the Chicago World's Fair brought their products to Shanghai, and all kinds of products were very popular among both Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai. They felt that the failure of various products to circulate was due to the lack of a liaison organization. Therefore, the representatives of products from Jiāngxī, Húnán, Jiāngsū, Fújiàn and other provinces Zhou Guànhóng, Wáng Sōngyóu, Shào Déhuī, Liǔ Hòumín, Zhāng Wéndì, Wáng Shìjié, Dǒng Kūnfán, Wú Guǎngzhì, etc., before going abroad, requested Lín Kānghóu, chairman of the National General Chamber of Commerce, Wáng Xiǎolài, chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and industrialists Wū Zhìháo, bankers Wáng Bóyuán, etc., to initiate the organization of the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Corporation, wanting to use the union of national products production and sales cooperation as a guide, to create a new front line for saving the nation through production. Wáng Xiǎolài, Lín Kānghóu, Wū Zhìháo, Wáng Bóyuán, etc., all agreed with his proposal, so they set up a preparatory office in the Níngbō Industrial Bank Building, and publicly elected Wáng Xiǎolài as the chief director of the preparatory office, Lín Kānghóu and Wū Zhìháo as the deputy directors, Wáng Bóyuán, Lù Qíshēng, Rèn Jīngpín, Wáng Sōngyóu, Wáng Sōngpǔ, Wú Guǎngzhì, Liǔ Hòumín, Dǒng Kūnfán, as preparatory committee members, and Zhū Déchāo as the secretary-general, to jointly plan and carry out the work. Later, in order to strive for rapid progress in the handling of affairs, the preparatory committee meeting reorganized the secretariat, invited Lín Wànláng as the director of the secretariat, and Wáng Píngnán, Wáng Jiàn'é, Wú Guǎngzhì, Zhū Déchāo, Guō Yǒngxī, Rèn Jīngpín, as secretaries, to handle the preparatory work separately.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Participation in the Initiative</h3>
<p>Since the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Corporation began preparations, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have joined the organization after hearing the news. As of yesterday, in addition to Wáng Xiǎolài, Lín Kānghóu, Wū Zhìháo, and the representatives of various provinces who participated in the Chicago World's Fair, those who have signed up to participate in the initiative include Shǐ Liàngcái, Zhāng Gōngquán, Chén Guāngfǔ, Liú Hóngshēng, Sòng Zǐliáng, Xǔ Shìyīng, Zhuāng Sōngfǔ, Yú Qiàqīng, Jīn Tíngsūn, Xú Xīnlì, Yú Zuǒtíng, Wú Yùnzāi, Lǐ Míngyáng, Yè Fúxiāo, Wú Wèirú, Xú Yǒngzuò, Lù Bóhóng, Xú Màotáng, Guō Shùn, Jīn Hóuchéng, Féng Zhòngqīng, Xuē Dǔbì, Pān Gōngzhǎn, Zhāng Zhúpíng, Yán Fāng, Jiāng Yīpíng, Wáng Bīnyàn, Cài Wújì, Xǔ Tíngzuǒ, Hú Xīwéi, Lǐ Wànlǐ, Chǔ Huisēng, Wáng Bódù, Zhōu Bāngjùn, Chén Shéngwǔ, Yú Guózhēn, Xiàng Shéngwǔ, Zhèng Chéngqīng, Zhū Wénqǐ, Wū Zhìhé, Yè Róngjūn, Hóng Rén, Zhuō Yǔtíng, Wū Yúnchéng, Chén Yìzhōu, Wū Tǐngshēng, Jiāng Zhèngchán, Xú Chūnróng, Cáo Guóhuá, Lú Chéngzhāng, Wáng Zhòngyuán, Yè Dàoyuān, Lín Wànláng, Yáng Yǒngnián, Wáng Píngnán, Hú Shūrén, Rèn Jīngpín, Wáng Hónglái, Sūn Jílán, Hóng Jīngshān, Wáng Jiàn'é, Qín Shànbǎo, Wāng Bǎotáng, Chuán Fāngtíng, Zhū Déchāo, Lù Qíshēng, and dozens of others. It is expected that even more enthusiastic supporters of national products will participate when the founders' meeting is convened.</p>
<h3>Banquet of the Bankers' Association</h3>
<p>Wáng Xiǎolài, Lín Kānghóu, and Wū Zhìháo, the directors of the preparatory committee of the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Corporation, held a banquet yesterday at the Bankers' Association to report on the aims of the company's organization. Those who attended included Kǒng Yōngzhī and Sòng Hànzhāng, as well as dozens of others. During the banquet, Wáng Xiǎolài, Lín Kānghóu, Wū Zhìháo, Xuē Dǔbì, and Chǔ Huisēng expressed their views one after another. Finally, Rèn Jīngpín, on behalf of the secretariat, reported on the company's operating guidelines. Everyone enjoyed themselves until over 10 p.m. before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Wáng Xiǎolài's Speech</h3>
<p>In this period of severe national crisis,</p>
<p>Some people may dislike our call to promote national products as a way to save the nation through production as too slow. But it is better to act than to do nothing if we only blame the slowness and have no other quick way to save the nation to implement. And this kind of slow effort is the fundamental work of developing the economy and building strength. It can cultivate the source of donations for the righteous army resisting the enemy in the front, and it can be the strong backing for the government to prolong its resistance and construction. If all the people of the country can earnestly work to produce and save the country, then the day of revenge and washing away humiliation will not be far away. The purpose of our initiating the organization of the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Corporation is to combine the producers and sellers of national products into one, not only to make the local products and products of various provinces unhindered in circulation, but also to enable the local products and products of various provinces to increase production and improve and progress, and to stabilize the lives of people in various places. In the future, we will gradually proceed to make all provinces and regions have branch companies, and be able to help each other and seek to develop together, in order to achieve the goal of saving the country through production. Therefore, this kind of company is not purely profit-oriented, but wants to use the power of mutual assistance and cooperation to promote the idea of saving the country through industry and commerce. We hope that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically participate, and if not, please give us criticism from time to time so that we can follow it.</p>
<h3>Lín Kānghóu's Speech</h3>
<p>The motivation for us to initiate the organization of the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Corporation really began with the proposal of the representatives of various provinces who went to the United States to participate in the Chicago World's Fair. After the various products from various provinces participating in the Chicago World's Fair were shipped to Shanghai, they were very popular among both Chinese and foreign people in Shanghai. If this organization had existed before, then these products would have been sold in Shanghai long ago. Recently, I received a report from the representatives who went to the United States to participate in the Chicago World's Fair that the average number of visitors to the China Pavilion at the conference was more than 15,000 per day, and many people were happy to buy various specially made products, such as Jiangxi porcelain, Yixing pottery, Fujian lacquerware, and Hunan embroidery, and so on, have already telegraphed for more. It can be seen that it is also very possible to promote national products abroad. In the past, no one organized an agency to pay attention to international trade, which not only reduced many figures in our country's foreign trade statistics, but also made the people of the country lose many opportunities for production. There are also many patriots and enthusiastic overseas Chinese who want to purchase national products, but are suffering from not knowing what is national products and where national products can be obtained. All these are because there is no joint organization between producers and sellers, which drives the people of the country to buy foreign goods. This time, we have approved the motivation of the representatives of various provinces who participated in the Chicago World's Fair to initiate the organization of the China National Products Production and Sales Joint Corporation, so that the domestic and foreign countries can increase the benefits of national production and purchasing power, and not sit idly by and miss them.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhihao's Speech</h3>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen present today are all founders of this company, and also esteemed seniors who have always been enthusiastic in supporting industry. There are many ways to save the country. The most significant include food, national defense, economy, education, and water conservancy, but the most needed is still the economy. This is because all the above aspects require the support of economic power. Currently, the state of the nation faces external threats from powerful enemies and internal troubles such as rural bankruptcy, foreign goods invading the market, the decline of domestic products, and the entire financial system trending towards depletion. If we do not urgently seek relief, the people will be impoverished and the wealth exhausted, and how can we survive? Recently, patriotic individuals have been striving to manage the economy as a way to save the country, such as revitalizing rural areas, improving silk and tea, developing the fishing industry, and promoting domestic goods. From top to bottom, we are working together and actively proceeding. The significance of our company's preparation and organization is to contribute our meager efforts to serve the country. Gentlemen, with your well-thought-out plans, you will surely have excellent plans to offer at any time, and we will proceed in sequence. I would also like to contribute my humble opinion to all of you. Our country has vast lands and abundant resources, but due to inconvenient transportation, insufficient economy, and conservative commerce, the products of various provinces cannot circulate among each other, resulting in some goods being abandoned on the ground, and others being blocked and accumulated. At the same time, there is a lack of domestic industry to supply the needs of various regions, and supply and demand do not match, causing the import of foreign goods to gradually increase. Therefore, our company is connecting enthusiastic people from all walks of life, searching for specialized talents, and gathering economic strength to unite producers and consumers, so that the supply and demand of domestic products can be met. Our company will cooperate with economic talents and industries to implement the following tasks: (1) Assist provinces and regions in establishing domestic goods trading firms to cooperate with our company to circulate products from various regions; (2) Assist factories by providing economic and talent support, supplying raw materials on one hand and improving products on the other hand to reduce costs and improve product quality; (3) Pay attention to international trade, as we often hear of the patriotism of overseas Chinese, which is no less than that of people in the country. Because there is no domestic goods supply as much as possible, they have to purchase foreign goods. Therefore, our company will contact overseas Chinese to organize trading firms so that domestic goods can be sold abroad smoothly. Other aspects include uniting the financial community to set up domestic goods warehouses and domestic goods pledge financing businesses, contributing to the government to implement protective tariffs, and promoting transportation to facilitate transport, and requesting the government to provide protection for goods along the way. All of the above are the business of our company, and we will proceed in sequence after the company is established. However, this matter is of great importance, and it is necessary to gather enthusiastic people from home and abroad, and work together to achieve success. I also hope that all of you present today, as well as the founders who have not attended, will introduce more enthusiastic people to participate in the initiation to strengthen the foundation and facilitate progress.</p>
<h3>Xue Dubi's Speech</h3>
<p>Promoting domestic goods has been a loud cry for the past twenty years, but because of the lack of vigorous implementation, no results have been seen, resulting in the outflow of money, the influx of foreign goods, and the decline of domestic goods, creating a situation of economic hardship for the people. In fact, commercial competition is an invisible economic war between countries, which must be organized and connected to have a chance of winning. Otherwise, individual battles will inevitably result in being defeated one by one. The China National Products Production and Marketing Joint Company is a new organization and a new front for China to conduct commercial warfare with foreign countries, enabling both production and marketing parties to cooperate fully and jointly respond to the war. It is a major need in modern economic competition. The use of this organization will not only promote the smooth sale of domestic goods and have a good effect on resisting the invasion of foreign goods, but also enable the progress of domestic goods production and increase production to help unemployed farmers and workers stabilize their lives, so that the national strength can be stabilized and move towards enrichment, to meet the needs of the government's long-term resistance. Therefore, to save the country, to save the poor, and to seek revenge, we must all do our best to participate in this organization and complete this organization.</p>
<h3>Chu Huiseng's Speech</h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Lin Kanghou, and Mr. Wu Zhihao have initiated the China National Products Production and Marketing Joint Company to seek mutual assistance and mutual benefits for both production and marketing parties. This is the most valuable work in the year of domestic goods. From the perspective of production, it is not enough to set up a factory to fulfill the promotion of domestic goods. It is only necessary to pay close attention to raw materials. For example, in the case of cigarettes, there are many domestic cigarette factories in China, but 70% to 80% of the raw materials are still foreign goods, and only 20% to 30% are domestic raw materials. If we can replace these 70% to 80% of the raw materials with domestic goods, we will surely be able to help the development of agriculture and increase the harvest of farmers. However, due to the lack of close contact between the factories, they have failed to make overall plans. For example, there are many domestic goods factories that are similar to foreign goods or Japanese goods. Because Japanese goods are depreciated and dumped, they are often affected. Because Japanese merchants have government and banking support, they have support for advancement and retreat. Chinese factories often feel a lack of this kind of support. We very much hope that the company will be established as soon as possible and be able to create this kind of support for domestic goods factories under the cooperation and control of production and marketing, so that domestic goods can compete with foreign goods.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council</p>
<h3>Scheduled Discussion of Factory Inspection Case</h3>
<p>Yesterday was not a meeting date</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the report that the Shanghai Municipal Council would submit the seven measures for inspecting factories in the public concession to the board of directors for discussion on the 16th is not true. The meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Council will be convened next Wednesday (August 2nd), and yesterday was not the date for convening the meeting. According to the information officer of the bureau, Sayer, to the reporter of the Central News Agency, the case will be discussed at the meeting of the board of directors next Wednesday. As for the recent situation of the case negotiation, both parties can understand each other, and the rumor that there is still a dispute over the deadline is also not true.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry</p>
<h3>Director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Fisheries Bureau Changed</h3>
<p>Chen Zhongsheng resigned</p>
<p>Yuan Lianghua takes over</p>
<p>Takes office at the end of the month</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Chen Zhongsheng, counselor of the Ministry of Industry, has been serving concurrently as the director of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Regional Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry since January of this year. More than half a year has passed in an instant. Director Chen also resigned from his concurrent post because of the difficulty in handling affairs. The Ministry of Industry has appointed Yuan Lianghua to succeed him. According to Director Chen's statement of resignation reasons and the recent situation of the bureau, excerpts are as follows:</p>
<h3>Reasons for Resignation</h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Regional Marine Fisheries Administration of the Ministry of Industry has been in existence for several years, with a wide range of jurisdiction and important business. Since the Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry took office, he immediately thought of re-organizing the past achievements of the bureau, hoping to make everything perfect, so that the fisheries of our country can have significant progress in a considerable period of time. He once intended to serve concurrently as the director of the bureau, but then changed his mind to have me serve concurrently because of the complexity of the Ministry's affairs. I was instructed to do my best to reorganize. After arriving at the bureau, I was determined to reform, and abolished more than ten offices and branches that had been established before, and reorganized the fishing protection patrol ships. In addition, the important cases in the bureau were sorted out one by one, and the matters that should be handled were handled in sequence. Although I encountered obstacles from time to time, I still struggled tirelessly. This time, the dispute over the collection office of the Fisheries Improvement Association was ordered to be handled, and it was also resolved peacefully. A few days ago, I paid a special visit to the Minister to report everything, and because the reorganization of all matters has come to an end, and I have been running around for several months, my mind and body are exhausted, so I have repeatedly expressed my intention to resign. Minister Chen has been kind enough to take pity on my distress and approved my resignation. I have now ordered the officials in the bureau to rush to complete the work.</p>
<h3>Successor Candidate</h3>
<p>Since the Ministry approved Director Chen's resignation, the Ministry has appointed Mr. Yuan Lianghua to succeed him. Mr. Yuan is a native of Guangdong and originally served as a specialist in the Ministry of Industry. He has done a lot of research on fisheries. Now Director Chen has ordered his subordinates to rush to complete the work and has telegraphed the new director Yuan Lianghua to come to take over as soon as possible. It is learned that Director Yuan is scheduled to take over at the end of the month.</p>
<h3>Anti-Imperialist Congress Suspended</h3>
<p>The Barbusse Investigation Team will still come to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the saying that writers and pacifists from all over the world are preparing to come to China to hold the World Anti-Imperialist Congress has been decided to be temporarily suspended, because the environment does not allow it. However, the investigation team organized by the left-wing writer Barbusse will still arrive in Shanghai on August 5th and 6th as planned to investigate the truth about the Japanese invasion of China in the Northeast. It is also heard that five representatives from Korea and Taiwan who attended the Anti-Imperialist Congress have come to Shanghai one after another a few days ago. Three of them have been arrested by a certain party, and the whereabouts of the other two are unknown. This matter is a major blow to those who are actively convening the Anti-Imperialist Congress, but what exactly is going on remains to be verified.</p>

<h3>Acute Cholera Epidemic</h3>
<p>The Health Bureau has sent personnel to investigate</p>
<p>Engaged in injection prevention work</p>
<p>In the area of Caojiadu in the western part of Shanghai, cholera has been discovered a few days ago, and a total of six or seven people have died as a result. The Municipal Health Bureau learned that this kind of cholera will have a great impact on the lives of citizens once it spreads, so it has specially ordered the department to send personnel to investigate. According to the investigation report from the Third Department, this kind of disease is not real cholera, but an acute cholera epidemic. The bureau is now engaged in injection work to strive for prevention. Extra attention is paid to road cleaning and cold drinks, and personnel are sent to guide them to pay attention to hygiene. As for injection of the vaccine, since the beginning, it has been counted to have more than 100,000 injections. According to Director Li Tingan of the bureau to the reporter of the Xin Sheng News Agency, when the health cause was first started, most citizens did not understand, and only 30% of those who understood. After the efforts of the municipal government and the bureau to promote publicity, most citizens now understand the importance of health and cleanliness. Therefore, the progress of the health cause in the city has been quite smooth. It is expected that this kind of cholera epidemic will not spread.</p>

<h3>Construction Lottery Drawing at Yiyuan</h3>
<p>Time: July 31st, 1:00 PM</p>
<p>Welcome people from all walks of life to visit and watch</p>
<p>The National Government Aviation and Highway Construction Lottery will be drawn in public at the Nanjing Grand Theater on July 31st, which has been recorded in this newspaper. According to a certain important official of the office, the Construction Lottery was originally planned to be drawn at the Nanjing Grand Theater. However, the first phase of the lottery has issued 500,000 tickets, and all of them will be sold out soon. Since there are many buyers, those who come to visit the drawing will surely be enthusiastic. Moreover, on the day of the drawing, there are also two film companies, Fox and Lianhua, shooting news films, and a part of the location must be designated for photography. The Nanjing Grand Theater can only accommodate more than 1,000 people upstairs and downstairs. Those who arrive later may not have a place to stand. In order to avoid crowding, an agreement has been reached with Yiyuan to borrow the park as the drawing site. It is found that Yiyuan is located on Albert Road in the French Concession, with a large square in the middle, and bleachers on both sides can accommodate more than 10,000 spectators, which is very suitable for the drawing of the lottery. The drawing time is 1:00 PM on July 31st, but the venue will be opened at 12:00 AM in the morning, welcoming people from all walks of life to visit and check the drawing machines and balls. Moreover, the date for the sales of tickets by various distribution points in the Shanghai area was originally scheduled to end on July 25th. In view of the increasing enthusiasm of ticket buyers in recent days, the deadline for ticket sales has been extended to the 29th of this month. On the 30th of this month, only six major companies, including Wing On, Sincere, The Sun, The China National Products Company, and The Shanghai National Products Company, and the Da Yun Company are left to sell tickets. In the past ten days, because the drawing date is approaching, ticket buyers have been extremely enthusiastic, and the remaining tickets will be sold out soon. Those who want to buy tickets must hurry up, lest they miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>Two Foreigners</p>
<h3>Arrested for Privately Trafficking in Arms</h3>
<p>According to the Shanghai Evening Post, an unemployed American, Murphy, and a Polish man have been suspected of privately trafficking in arms and are currently under investigation by the police station. The two were arrested yesterday (the 25th). Except for the Polish man, who was sent to the Special District Court for trial this morning and then remanded for a week for further trial, Murphy was immediately transferred to the US authorities. However, Murphy claimed that because of lack of money, he intended to sell his own pistol. This act is not illegal according to US law, so he was temporarily allowed to be released on bail, pending investigation into whether he was privately trafficking in arms or only wanted to sell his own pistol.</p>
<p>District Court Welcomes Transfer</p>
<h3>Major Criminals in Customs Employees' Fraud Case</h3>
<p>The Jianghai Customs Supervisory Office recently discovered that employees of the customs colluded with outsiders, forged customs seals, changed tax prices, and engaged in fraud for many years, damaging the national treasury. The amount is difficult to calculate. Six employees involved were detained and confessed that the accomplices were the United Company in Room 208, upstairs in the China National Products Bank at No. 3 Hankou Road. Therefore, the water patrol police station, together with the general patrol police station, Chinese detectives Kang Zengxiang, Wu Chunrong, etc., went to the company to arrest eight accomplices, Su Kunnian, Su Kangnian (namely Zhang Keming), Fan Xingen, Mei Yaozu, Zhang Shimao, Xia Lanfang, Jiang Zheng Hai, and Chen Guoliang, and seized a large number of forged Jianghai Customs seals, etc. They were sent to the First Special District Court. The Jianghai Customs requested a transfer, but the police station lawyer Ru Baoyi believed that the customs was not a judicial organ and should be requested by the Shanghai District Court to be legal. After the ruling was made to wait for the Shanghai District Court to send a letter to welcome the transfer, the details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, the Procuratorate of the Shanghai District Court sent police officers to the Criminal Division 1 of the First Special Court to request a transfer. The police station lawyer Ru Baoyi also expressed his consent. After the inspection by Judge Feng Shide, he ordered the eight defendants, Su Kunnian, etc., to be handed over to the personnel from the Shanghai District Court to be brought back and tried in court.</p>
<p>Sheng Yu Chang</p>
<h3>Indecent Assault and Abandonment Case Settled</h3>
<p>Sheng Yuchang, the eldest grandson of the late Qing Dynasty Grand Tutor Sheng Xingxun, who resides at No. 1 Betang Road in the French Concession, is thirty-seven years old this year. Last winter, he was charged with indecent assault and abandonment by Yan Minghan and Yan Qu's husband and wife, and their daughter Shuangqin (twenty-five years old this year), who live on Kang Nai Road, and were represented by two lawyers, Dong Kang and Zhang Zhiyi, at the Second Special Court, requesting an investigation and requesting compensation for alimony, etc., which was incidental to civil litigation. Judge Wang Gangxu repeatedly held court to summon the defendant, who was defended by lawyer Qiu Fenling. The judge repeatedly persuaded both parties to reconcile at each hearing, but after discussion by the two lawyers, it was delayed for half a year, but it was still unresolved. Until recently, Sheng personally went to Yan's residence (Sheng's property at No. 120 Guofumin Road) on the evening of the 21st of this month to sincerely ask Shuangqin for understanding, abandon the past and renew their old friendship and live together. Yan believed that Sheng had returned to his senses and could not refuse firmly, and agreed generously. The two parties reached an unconditional settlement. When summoned for questioning on the 24th, Shuangqin did not arrive and could not withdraw the lawsuit. The court ordered a change of date for further review. The details have been recorded in this newspaper on the 25th. Yesterday morning, they were summoned for questioning again. Sheng and Yan sat in a car prepared by themselves and waited in court. Sheng wore a white broadcloth suit and yellow leather shoes. Yan girl cut her hair short and wore a rose-red silk cheongsam with yellow thread trim, a black silk shirt underneath, flesh-colored stockings and flat leather shoes, and a red leather wallet in her hand. Her posture was beautiful. Before the court opened, the two leaned on the iron railing on the west side of the first court and whispered, which attracted the attention of the general public. When the court opened at 10:30, the court clerk summoned Sheng and Yan, each accompanied by their lawyers, to stand in the plaintiff and defendant seats. The judge first questioned the two parties about their age, origin, and address, and asked Yan if the case was settled, and answered that it was settled. Asked if the letter of withdrawal that was submitted the day before yesterday was submitted by you, and answered yes. Asked Sheng if your case was settled, and answered that it was settled. After listening to the statement, Judge Wang immediately stood up and announced the judgment. The case was not accepted. After the judgment, Yan and Sheng signed the transcript, took hands and exited, and drove home quickly in the original car. A sensational lawsuit involving adultery came to an end.</p>
<p>Europeans Come to China to Become Monks</p>
<h3>The Second Batch Arrives in Shanghai on the 28th</h3>

<p>A group of ten Buddhist disciples from countries such as France, Italy, and Belgium who came to China to be ordained were entertained by the monk Zhao Kong after arriving in Shanghai and stayed in Juelu at No. 131 Daxilu Road. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Juelu again, and it happened that Zhao Kong led his disciples who arrived in Shanghai to visit guests, but it was heard that Zhao Kong had already prepared monk clothes so that the ten disciples could change their clothes first. The teacher who teaches Chinese is also actively hiring, and it is expected that everything must be done by September 1st. As for the second batch of only three people, two are Germans and one is Lithuanian, and it is expected that they can arrive in Shanghai on the 28th of this month.</p>
<p>Young Wife Missing</p>
<h3>Adjutant Desperate Suicide</h3>
<p>Escorted back to his hometown by the orderly</p>
<p>Gone with both person and property, whereabouts unknown</p>
<p>At about 12:00 noon yesterday, a young man in military uniform resembling a military officer hired a rowing boat at the 16th Pier, claiming to cross to Pudong. It was unexpected that when he reached the middle of the river, the young man suddenly jumped into the river and committed suicide. Fortunately, his body sank and floated again, and he was rescued by the rower. When the boat arrived in Pudong, the rower sent him to the police, who took him to the Third District. According to the district chief's interrogation, his name was Chen Zhongying, 22 years old, from Liyang, and he was a graduate of the Huangpu Military Academy. He is currently serving as a social adjutant in the 55th Army Headquarters stationed in Beiping. He recently married a woman surnamed Mou (17 years old this year) as his wife in that place. Because he received a letter from his old mother at home, urging him to send money, I asked for leave to take my wife south. The accompanying person was an orderly from Shandong. When he arrived in the capital, he stayed in a hotel. I first asked the orderly to accompany my wife home to see my aunt, so as not to worry my parents. At that time, I took several boxes of luggage, including several sets of Western suits for all seasons, more than 200 silver dollars, and many other clothes. Because the orderly had been with me for two or three years and was very honest, I let him go boldly. I stayed in Nanjing for several days to visit old classmates who worked in Beijing and talk about the situation after our separation. After a few days, I returned to my hometown, but did not see my wife and the orderly. I asked my old mother, but she had not seen anyone either. I was anxious and returned to Beijing, and inquired everywhere, but there was no news for many days. I was ashamed to go home to see my mother, so I came to Shanghai alone to look for them. I have not found them for many days. I thought that my husband and wife were very affectionate, and my wife would never run away with the old orderly. I don't know if the soldier had evil intentions and forced her to another place, or if there was another accident. It is difficult to know. However, the marriage cost hundreds of silver dollars, and now clothes and ornaments worth more than 500 silver dollars have been taken away. I have lost both person and property, so I had the thought of ending my life, etc. After obtaining the confession, the district chief ordered him to prepare a document and send it to the Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>
<h3>Kicking a Ball Kills a Person</h3>
<p>Li Shoushan died of his injuries</p>
<p>Li Shoushan, a young man from Muyang, Jiangsu, is only nineteen years old. He currently lives at No. 342 Lime Office, Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai. He has an old mother and sister at home. He is small in stature and very intelligent. Recently, due to the popularity of soccer, he loves to play very much, so he practices and competes with his fellow youths in the nearby open space day and night. At about 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, Li was holding a competition with his comrades. In the midst of fierce competition, he wanted to head the ball, but suddenly a man named Yu Agen jumped up and tried to kick a ball. He lost his footing and accidentally kicked Li's stomach. Because the kicking force was too strong, he felt pain and fell to the ground. His family members were notified and rushed to the scene. Seeing that his injury was quite serious, they immediately took him to the Labor Hospital on Rue Robert for treatment, and then took him home. Unexpectedly, it was delayed until yesterday afternoon, because the injury involved the stomach, the situation suddenly increased, and he became unconscious and dying. In the evening, he suddenly died. His old mother and sister believed that he died unnaturally, so his sister Wang Li's went to take Yu Agen to the Sixth District Police Station. After District Officer Jiang questioned them separately, according to the defendant Yu's confession, he was 20 years old, from Yangzhou, and lived at No. 1661 Yinghua, Rue Robert. He and Li Shoushan played soccer together, and of course they had the intention of competing with each other. He was kicked in the foot by me, because I was kicking the ball, and he happened to catch up, it was not intentional, as everyone can see, etc. After obtaining the confession, District Officer Jiang believed that the case involved human life, and ruled to wait for a document to be sent to the court for trial.</p>
<h3>Chen Defeng's Corpse Must Be Autopsied</h3>
<p>After Chen Dada's adopted son, Li Wanzi, also known as Chen Defeng, the doorkeeper of the Family Industrial Cooperative on Difangting Road in the South City, died, it was suddenly rumored that his soul was attached to his aunt (Chen's sister) Yang Chen's body, complaining that he was murdered and asking his third uncle to seek justice for him. The details have been recorded in the previous newspaper. Recently, the neighbors have unanimously pointed out that Chen Dada's family members murdered him. It is said that Dada's wife, Gong, originally came from an affair and was originally surnamed Yan. After marrying Dada, she brought a daughter named San Mao, who has now recruited Wu Ajin (27 years old) as her son-in-law and has given birth to a son. Li Wanzi was born to Dada's brother, A'er, and was adopted by Dada as his son when he was nine years old. Dada recently bought 20 mu of land in Suzhou. Therefore, the neighbors thought that since Dada had adopted his nephew as his son and recruited his daughter in name, this was naturally to plot property and seize wealth. In order to show his sincerity, Chen Dada carried the coffin to the court yesterday morning and reported it for an autopsy. When Prosecutor Ouyang held a preliminary trial, he ordered Ajin to be temporarily detained and Chen Dada to be released on bail, and ordered the coffin to be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Medical Examination Institute for autopsy and examination, and then the case will be investigated after receiving the diagnosis.</p>
<h3>The First Special Court Schedules the Burning of Earth</h3>

<h3>Arrest of the Red Pill King of Pudong</h3>
<p>A One-Eyed Man Known as "Blind He of He Ying"</p>
<p>A Very Bad Habit of Smoking Red Pills Non-Stop</p>
<p>He Ying, from Yangzhou, 41 years old, is blind in one eye, so people call him "Blind He of He Ying." He has no permanent occupation. In recent years, he has been wholesaling the addictive drug red pills in the Pudong area, claiming to be a distribution director of the Xing Red Pill Company. He can sell as many as 100,000 pills per day, and no less than 40,000 or 50,000 pills, which is astonishing. In the Pudong area, he is known as the "Red Pill King." He has more than a dozen offices, so He's address is also uncertain. The method of privately carrying red pills is often changed. Initially, he hired a group of penniless old opium smokers to carry them, but they were easily recognized. Now, he has changed to using young women to hide and carry them. The number of red pills stored in each of his offices is not large, at most only a few thousand, to prevent being arrested and being able to fabricate excuses to absolve himself. However, the sales of red pills are good and the profits are high, so he married a wife and a concubine to indulge himself. He himself is also very addicted to red pills, smoking non-stop all night long, spending as much as four or five yuan a day, and can stay awake day and night. Yesterday at noon, after District Chief Zhang reported, he ordered Police Chief Guo to go to He's office at No. 97 Pengjiazhai to arrest He, along with 1,500 red pills. After interrogation at the district office, he was immediately taken to the bureau for strict handling.</p>
<p>Comprador of British American Tobacco Company</p>
<h3>Uncle and Nephew Fight Over Property in Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Dispute Over Shared Landed Property</p>
<p>Cai Fulin, a comprador for the British American Tobacco Company, is very wealthy. He has been kidnapped twice and ransomed with huge sums of money. Recently, due to property disputes, he is involved in a lawsuit with his two uncles, Wen Kui and Wen Rong. Cai Fulin's grandfather, Cai Qiuquan, married Ms. Yu and Ms. Xie as his wives. Ms. Yu gave birth to two sons, Wen Hua and Wen Yuan. Ms. Xie also gave birth to two sons, Wen Kui and Wen Rong. Wen Hua and Wen Yuan both died early. Wen Hua left behind three sons, the eldest being Fulin, the second Meilin, and the youngest Yunlin. In November of the second year of the Xuantong reign of the Qing Dynasty, Qiuquan passed away. Wen Kui and Wen Rong were still young at that time, while Fulin had already grown up. Therefore, not only did Fulin take over the position in the British American Tobacco Company left by his father, but even the estate was managed by Fulin. In July of the fifth year of the Republic of China, Fulin suddenly ordered the Wen Kui brothers and their mother, Ms. Xie, to move from their residence in Yongqing Lane, Xin Zha Road, saying that it would be renovated. However, Wen Kui and others later found out that the property had been sold. At that time, they demanded a share of the property from Fulin based on Qiuquan's will, but after investigation, they learned that all the land had been sold off over the years. Then they began negotiations with him, and it was not until July 10th of the eighteenth year of the Republic of China that an agreement was reached. On January 5th of last year, Ms. Xie became seriously ill and feared the worst, so she told Wen Kui that the ancestral cemetery was jointly owned and ordered him to inquire about Fulin to know how much jointly owned property there was. Fulin initially did not disclose it, and it was not until Wen Kui and others entrusted lawyers to negotiate that they discovered that the jointly owned property had been divided by Fulin with his younger brother Yunlin and Meilin's son Zhenyang in March of the seventeenth year. They believed that this behavior was improper, so they hired lawyers Wu Kaisheng, Tu Kunfan, Ni Jiong, etc., to file a petition with the First Special District Local Court, requesting mediation, but it was unsuccessful. Then they filed a lawsuit against Cai Fulin and Cai Yunlin for division of property, stating the location, acreage, and value of the disputed property, requesting that it be divided equally into four shares, with the two plaintiffs receiving two shares, estimated to be worth about 100,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Luo Chongtai of the First Special Court opened a court to summon them. The defendant Cai Fulin did not appear, so he ordered his son to appear with the second defendant Cai Yunlin to be questioned. First, the two plaintiffs, Cai Wen Kui and Cai Wen Rong, stated the intent of the lawsuit, and stated that what was previously divided was another part of the estate, and that the jointly owned land was not divided. According to Cai Yunlin's statement, the so-called jointly owned land is the company land mentioned in my grandfather Qiuquan's will. According to the instructions in the will, this company land should be inherited by our three brothers. Judge Luo stated that the case was complicated and ordered the two parties to collect evidence and reschedule the hearing. Municipal Social Affairs Bureau.</p>
<h3>Preparing to Open a Public Factory</h3>
<p>Relief for Unemployed Workers in War Zone</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau recently plans to establish a public factory in the Gaojing District. The latest developments are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Greatest Purpose</h3>
<p>The launch of this matter was still before March or April. The greatest purpose of wanting to run this factory is to provide relief to unemployed workers in the war zone. Since the January 28th Incident, factories in Zhabei, Jiangwan and other districts have almost been destroyed by artillery fire. Taking the printing industry as an example, 60 to 70 factories have closed down, with over 4,000 unemployed workers, most of whom are workers from the Commercial Press and the printing department of Labor University. Therefore, it was initially planned to open a printing factory in the war zone to provide relief to over 4,000 unemployed printing workers, but it could not be realized due to funding issues.</p>
<h3>Drafting Plans</h3>
<p>Later, the Municipal Government issued charity horse racing prizes, and the remaining funds were originally intended for the reconstruction of the war zone. Therefore, Wu Ya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, requested the Mayor to allocate 30,000 yuan as funding for running the public factory. The Mayor instructed to first prepare a plan and submit it for approval before making a decision. Director Wu then appointed more than ten staff members from the bureau to form a design committee to carry out the design. The plan has now been drafted and submitted to the Municipal Government for approval.</p>
<h3>Surveying Addresses</h3>
<p>The address of the factory has been surveyed and determined to be in the Gaojing Temple Public Village. There are more than 130 houses, built with funds from the Shanghai Local Association. It was originally intended to be lent to disaster victims in the war zone, but it was not suitable for use, so no disaster victims lived there. Therefore, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau sent personnel to the Local Association to negotiate a lease, and the Association agreed to lend it. Personnel have been sent to take over, but it was stated at the time that the factory must be opened within six months, otherwise the Local Association will take it back. Since the takeover, preparations have been actively underway to open it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Emphasis on Manual Labor</h3>
<p>In the future, the factory will focus on handicrafts and will not use large-scale machinery. The purpose of opening this factory is to provide relief to unemployed workers, and most of the unemployed workers in the war zone are craftsmen. If machines are used, they must undergo training, and the number of workers accommodated is not large, which does not conform to the original intention of providing relief to unemployed workers. However, if the economy becomes more affluent in the future, it should be expanded at any time.</p>
<p>Land Title Regularization</p>
<h3>Exchange of Land Certificates in the Fahua District</h3>
<p>Starting from August 1st</p>
<p>The Municipal Land Bureau, based on the fact that the land of each household in Dongqi (East Seven) Tu, the old 28th Bao of the Fahua District has been accurately measured, should start exchanging land occupation certificates as soon as possible. Therefore, it is specifically set to start the exchange from August 1st, and a notice has been issued, saying: For the notice, it is found that the land of each household in Dongqi (East Seven) Tu, the 28th Bao of the Fahua District (East to Xujiazhai, South to Lougou Yangjing, West to Xujiabang, North to X溝浜) has been accurately measured, and the exchange of land occupation certificates will begin on August 1st. Each household should bring the old field slips, as well as the grain slips for the most recent three years, and other property rights evidence within one month to report the location and four boundaries of the land managed, and confirm the terrain. After verification, the field slips will be kept by the bureau for cancellation, and the bureau will issue a receipt for receiving the map drafts. After signing for three months, the land occupation certificate will be collected to manage the industry. Please inform each other. This notice.</p>
<h3>Deadline for Claiming Silk Public Debt Tickets</h3>
<p>Before July 31st</p>
<p>Bring Export Certificate and Public Measurement List</p>
<p>In order to encourage exports and develop silk exports, the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces issued short-term public bonds for the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang. For every bale of silk exported from Chen factories, a subsidy of 100 taels of silver will be granted, which is equivalent to 140 yuan in silk public debt tickets. This subsidy was announced to be terminated at the end of May. The joint office of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Chen Silk Promotion and Chen Silk Cocoon Arrangement Committee has not yet completed the procedures, so it has not ended. Now, the joint office of the Xiang Committee notified Jiangsu and Zhejiang factory silk merchants yesterday, saying that the matter of subsidizing the export of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Chen factory silk and issuing short-term public bonds for the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been finalized that the subsidy will be terminated at the end of May this year. Now that this office is about to close, all those who export Jiangsu and Zhejiang Chen factory silk before May 31st and are eligible to receive the subsidy public debt, please bring the export certificate and public measurement list to this office at the intersection of North Shanxi Road and Haining Road for registration before July 31st to receive the subsidy voucher, so that you can exchange it for public debt tickets at the National Goods Bank. Expired, invalid, I hope you all pay attention, special notice.</p>
<h3>The Anqing Steamer Grounded in Jiujiang</h3>
<p>Cargo and Passengers Transferred to Ganzhou as Substitute</p>
<p>The Taikoo Company's Yangtze River steamer Anqing, which was carrying cargo from Hankou back to Shanghai this time, was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai yesterday. On the morning of the 15th, when the ship was sailing upstream of Jiujiang, it was foggy and the river was flowing rapidly. The river pilot took the wrong channel, causing the ship to run aground. The ship was carrying a lot of cargo downstream, and the draught was very heavy. The hull was already stuck in the shallow beach sand, so the shipowner repeatedly reversed, but could not escape. He had to send a telegram to Shanghai for help. Yesterday afternoon, the company telegraphed the Hankou and Xun branches to send ships nearby to tow and unload the cargo. The passengers on board were also transferred to other ships to come to Shanghai. After reducing the load, it will be towed again. Today, the ship's export run has been replaced by the Ganzhou steamer from Shanghai. Whether the hull has been damaged or not will have to wait until it is rescued back to Shanghai before inspection.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Liao Yuqing, a woman from Hubei, 16 years old, has a lover named Feng Jianying, 23 years old, from Suzhou, who makes silver shields for a living. They live together in Tangjiawan, Zhaozhou Road, like a couple. Later, Feng lost his job, resulting in financial constraints, so quarrels often broke out outside the house. They announced their separation in the first month of the lunar year and separated. Feng Jianying did not know where to go. Yuqing had to temporarily live with a friend surnamed Li at No. 15 Fuxinli, East Zilaihuo Street. After several months, she could not forget Jianying, and living under someone else's roof was not a good plan. Therefore, the idea of suicide suddenly arose. She went out the night before and swallowed a weight of raw smoke, and immediately returned to the Li residence. After being discovered, she urgently hired a car to send her to Renji Hospital for treatment, and died at two thirty in the morning the next day.</p>

<h3>Worker Killed by Machine</h3>
<p>Family Demands Compensation</p>
<p>The Hui Ji Ship Breaking Factory, No. 93 Jiushanzhili, Gaochang Temple, Nanshi, specializes in dismantling all kinds of old ships. The scale of business is large, and there are many workers. Tan Shenghe, a worker from Hefei, Anhui, 25 years old, was in the machine room of the factory. At about 4:00 a.m. yesterday morning, he was accidentally hit in the lower abdomen by the machine operator's hand while working. He fell to the ground in an instant, and blood flowed like a gush. After being discovered by colleagues, they quickly ordered the engine to be shut down and went forward to check. Tan Shenghe's injuries were very serious, and his abdomen had ruptured.

<p>Second Special District Prison</p>
<h3>Staff and Officials Fight in the Office</h3>
<p>Candidate Warden Reprimands Foreman Warden</p>
<p>Slate as a Murder Weapon, Two People Go to Court</p>
<p>When the upper and lower staff, guards, and guards of the Second Special District Prison in the French Concession were established on August 1st of the 20th year, the Ministry of Justice transferred them from prisons in various places for appointment. After the former Warden Xie Fuzi was arrested for the case, the vacant position was taken over by Sun Xiong, who was appointed by the Ministry. Since Sun took office only two weeks ago, he has replaced the old staff, guards, guards, etc., and appointed more than 30 private individuals. Gong Hanbin, the leader of the third shift, 26 years old, from Jingmen, Hubei, was transferred from the first prison in Hubei when the prison was established, and has been in office for nearly two years. At 11:00 a.m. on the 25th, he led 20 brothers on duty. At 3:00 p.m., Gong inspected the prisoner's rooms on the 3rd and 4th floors at 1:00 p.m. At that time, Wu Bingyan, the candidate warden of the prison (45 years old, from Huangpi, Hubei, brought by the new warden, and arrived on the 15th of this month), was also checking all the prisoners in the prison. After Gong finished checking the room, he checked the letters sent by the prisoners' families on a small table next to the sports field. At that time, there were more than 300 prisoners exercising in the field. When Gong was checking the letters, he took off the hat he was wearing on his head and put it on the table because it was hot, and unbuttoned his collar to wipe his sweat. Wu saw this and blamed Gong for not being polite in his duties and for violating the regulations. Gong replied that it was hot and sweaty, and it was not a violation of the regulations to take off his hat and unbutton his collar to wipe his sweat. Wu reprimanded Gong for not obeying the guidance, and went back to the office to report the situation to the warden, requesting that Gong be dismissed. At 4:30 p.m. after the shift, Gong went to the 2nd section office to see Wu, asking what regulations he had violated that led to his dismissal. Wu replied that you don't understand the rules. It is appropriate to dismiss you because you were not properly dressed in your duties. Gong listened to Wu's words and said that since you, the chief guard, took office, you have never worn official public uniforms or armed belts, but often wear Zhongshan suits. Is this a violation of the regulations? I will go with you to see the warden for evaluation. These few words further angered Wu. He took a slate on the writing table and hit Gong's head and forehead twice, causing him to be injured and bleed, and his head and face were covered in blood. The two twisted into a ball.</p>
<p>After being persuaded by the people next to him, Gong immediately reported to the head of the Central Police Station. The head ordered Gong to be sent to Guangci Hospital for examination and treatment. He also sent Detective Zheng Jikun to the prison, arrested Wu, hung the slate used for the attack, and brought it to the police station for custody. That night, the warden learned of the situation and immediately sent the guard of the smoking ban office to the police station to protect Wu and try to resolve the case. The head of the police station did not allow it. Yesterday afternoon, the police station escorted Wu to the 8th Criminal Court of the 2nd Special Court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo questioned him. First, Yao Zhaodi, a lawyer from the police station, stated the case and filed a lawsuit according to Article 293 of the Criminal Law. Then, the detective reported the situation of the arrest of the defendant and submitted the slate used for the attack. The plaintiff Gong Hanbin also stated the previous situation, and said that he was dismissed without any reason, and he should not scold me in front of the prisoners, which damaged my prestige. Since the new warden took office, he has appointed private individuals, his uncle Cui Guangdao, his nephew Huang Bogang, Huang Mingjun, etc., more than 30 people. If our old colleagues have a very minor fault, they will be dismissed. The defendant has been in office for a short time and has dismissed many people in Caohejing. All his old colleagues are recruited and employed. He flatters the warden and oppresses us, and is preparing to dismiss our old people so that he can use his private individuals. When Wu Bingyan was questioned, he confessed that I found that the plaintiff violated regulations in his duties and was not polite. He did not obey the guidance and retorted. Therefore, I reported to the warden to dismiss him. Later, he came and hit me in the face from behind without asking why. Then, he hit me on the head with a slate. I did not hit him. I have been in office for a short time and have no opinions with him. I am completely performing my duties. The officer listened to the confession and ordered the court clerk to ask the forensic doctor to examine the plaintiff's injuries. Because it was past office hours, the forensic doctor had left. The court announced that the questioning would be rescheduled to the morning of the 29th. The defendant was ordered to reside in his current residence, and the plaintiff was ordered to go to the forensic doctor's office for examination tomorrow (that is, today) morning. The bailiff was also sent to the prison to entrust the warden, and the court adjourned at 2:00 p.m. After the case occurred, all the guards were indignant, so they all went to court yesterday to listen and were willing to testify when necessary.</p>
<p>North Jiangxi Road</p>
<h3>Robbery Case Scheduled for Sentencing</h3>
<p>Shen Chongli, a Chinese detective of the Hongkou Police Station, and Yang Zhaoqing, a detective, arrested four bandits, Zhang Defu, Chen Jinshan, Hu Xuekuan, and Li Fuxing, at North Jiangxi Road on the evening of the 10th of this month, and confiscated a pistol with five bullets. They were escorted to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention.</p>
<p>After investigation by the detectives handling the case, it was found that the defendants had colluded with accomplices, held weapons, and robbed the two households of Liu Fu, No. 311 Dalianwan Road, and Gao Zhou, No. 313 Meizhou Road, of silver ocean ornaments between January 20th and March 28th of this year. They shot and injured the Gao Zhou, who died on the spot, and attempted to rob Wang Hexiang's property at No. 716 Lan Road. The case is related to the joint robbery of Jiang Shuncheng, which has been determined in another case. Yesterday morning, the police station brought Jiang, who was in prison, together with the four Zhangs, to the Criminal Court 3 of the Special Court. Judge Wu Zehan questioned them. Zhang Tianyin, a lawyer from the police station, stated the previous situation, saying that the defendants Zhang Defu and Chen Jinshan admitted to robbing Gao Zhou's family property on Meizhou Road at the police station, and Xiang, who was at large, shot and killed her on the spot. Gao Lan-ying, Gao's daughter, witnessed Zhang Defu at the scene. The Liu family robbery case on Dalianwan Road was committed by Chen Jinshan et al. The attempted robbery of the He Xiang family on Lan Road was also committed by Zhang Defu together with Zhang Ahe and others. As soon as they entered the door, they were about to search for robbery, but the owner, Wang Shi, shouted loudly to catch the thief. The rogues were frightened and escaped. The two defendants Zhang Chen also admitted at the police station. Today, the plaintiffs have all arrived in court, so they presented their handcuffs for inspection. Pang Na, a Westerner from the police station's pistol room, also presented a report confirming that the pistol was indeed the murder weapon that killed Gao Zhou. After Judge Wu questioned the defendants for a long time, he appointed a pro bono lawyer to defend the defendants and ordered them to be sent back to prison for sentencing on a scheduled date.</p>

<p>L Municipal Public Security Bureau Investigation</p>
<h3>Wang Shuchiao Suspected of Assassinating Song</h3>
<p>Follow Central Government Orders to Investigate Thoroughly</p>
<p>Bureau's Investigation Will Be Completed Soon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau recently applied to the Public Concession Police for assistance in arresting Wang Shuchiao and Lin Zeruan, who were suspected of plotting to assassinate Finance Minister Song, but the Municipal Council opposed the transfer. The First Special District Local Court changed its approach and ordered the Municipal Public Security Bureau to produce the suspects in both cases, but limited their return within three days so that the police could continue the investigation. Later, because the Public Security Bureau took it away, it took a considerable amount of time to investigate everything, so it was not returned as scheduled, which caused dissatisfaction with the Municipal Council. The Municipal Council made a statement to the court the day before yesterday, but the Municipal Public Security Bureau believed that the Municipal Council seemed to have a misunderstanding of the situation, so</p>
<p>The bureau chief sent lawyer Zhan Jifeng, the legal advisor, to the First Special Court yesterday morning to explain clearly, roughly saying that the Public Security Bureau originally applied for transfer in the case of Wang Shuchiao and others. Because the police station</p>
<p>In opposition, the presiding judge ruled that the Public Security Bureau should take it away for three days. The Public Security Bureau was willing to comply with this ruling, and the lawyer also made this clear that day. The director expressed his approval very much. Later, he received a telegram from the Municipal Government to the Central Government, stating that the case was serious and complex, and ordered a thorough investigation. The Bureau respected the Central Government's order and conducted a particularly strict investigation, which took time. Therefore, it was not returned within three days. This has been communicated to the court by the Bureau, stating the reasons and hoping for understanding. As for the case of Lin, the Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The investigation is coming to a close and can be resolved in a few days. In short, this is an administrative matter between the government office and the court, so there is an obligation to cooperate and assist each other, and there is no need to use means.</p>

<p>Special Report</p>
<h3>Municipal Facilities in This City After the War (Continued)</h3>
<p>E. Reconstruction Work. (1) Restoring Police Authority in the War Zone. Since the January 28 Incident, police districts 4, 5, and 7 under the Municipal Police Bureau had all become war zones, and the police could not exercise their authority. All district chiefs and police officers were first concentrated in the southern city, weeding out the weak and retaining the strong, and temporarily organized into squads 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, and 12, and a special squad. After the end of the war and the takeover of the Zhabei and Wusong police districts, the squads were assigned to serve in their respective districts, and the police authority in districts 4, 5, and 7 was restored. (2) Planning to Restore the Police Training School. The school was disbanded during the war a year ago. The Municipal Police Bureau is currently planning to restore it. (3) Adding Three Police Shifts to the Sixth District and Establishing Three More Police Stations. Due to the thin police force in the Sixth District and its proximity to roads built beyond the boundaries, the existing police officers were insufficient for deployment. Now, three more police shifts have been added, totaling three police chiefs and thirty police officers, and three police stations have been added on Youli South Road, Yidingpan Road, and Zhongshan Road. (4) Constructing the Seventh District Station to Supervise the Zhanghuabang Police Station. The old site of the station was destroyed by artillery fire. Now, three bungalows are being built on the site for the station chief and police officers to use as offices and residences. (5) Constructing Police Station Buildings in the City Center. The police station in the city center was completed in May 1933. After the Municipal Government inspected and accepted it, the Police Bureau ordered the second station of the seventh district to move in and operate. (6) Adding One Police Shift to the Third Station of the Sixth District. (B) Post-War Relief Work. (1) Employing More Officers to Take Important Positions. After the restoration of police authority in districts 4, 5, and 7, with the end of the military situation and the need to rebuild everything, full arrangements were necessary to overcome the difficulties. In addition to the original officers and police, ten officers, thirteen translators, and thirteen inspectors were added. (2) Establishing a Machine Gun Squad. The Public Security Police Brigade only had five squads. Patrolling and guarding were often insufficient. A machine gun squad was established in April 1933. (3) Purchasing Broadswords and Distributing them to the Police Brigade for Training. (C) Firefighting Work. (1) Zhabei District. The district has four fire brigades, including the Zhabei Fire Brigade and the Zhabei 1134 Fire Brigade. During the war, two damaged pumps and five hose carts were damaged, and about 60-70% of other items such as hoses,</p>
<p>hats, uniforms, and equipment were lost. Moreover, the brigade buildings of the third and fourth sections were completely destroyed by artillery fire. After the takeover, 12,400 yuan was allocated</p>
<p>yuan as a temporary restoration fee. Now, it is gradually being restored. (2) Yinxiang District. The district has two fire brigades, one in the town and one at the Hujiamuqiao Fire Brigade. The brigade buildings were not affected during the war, but daily necessities were looted by rioters. After the takeover, 2,000 yuan was allocated as a restoration fee. Recently, all work has returned to normal. Recently, the Hongzhen Fire Brigade added a new-style "Ketterick" brand fire pump truck to strengthen the fire protection capabilities of the district. (3) Jiangwan District. The district has one fire brigade, the Jiangwan Fire Brigade. Although it was on the front line during the war, the brigade building was fortunately not affected, but furniture and water hoses, fire engines, etc.</p>
<p>have been scattered. Recently, work has returned to normal. (4) Wusong District. The district originally had four fire brigades: Wusong, Wusong East District, Wusong Ning Shang, and Wusong Liangxi. During the war, due to intense artillery fire, the Ning Shang and Liangxi brigade buildings were severely damaged. After the war, the responsible personnel were scattered and could not be restored. Subsequently, the Municipal Police Bureau sent personnel to actively gather the responsible personnel of each brigade to discuss restoration methods. It was finally decided to merge the brigades into two, named the Wusong First and Second Sections Fire Brigade, gathering old personnel to serve in the brigade, and 3,100 yuan was allocated to restore it. (5) Zhenru District. The district has one fire brigade, the Zhenru Fire Brigade, which did not suffer major losses because it was in the rear. (D) Household Registration Work. Since taking over the war zone, clearing up household registration has been extremely important. After the takeover, the Municipal Police Bureau immediately dispatched household registration officers and police from various districts in the southern city to the war zone to distribute survey forms from house to house, register household transfers, add door numbers, re-survey and map door numbers, and draft new guarantee agreements, etc.</p>
<p>F. Public Administrative Matters. When the Shanghai Incident occurred, the affiliated agencies established by the Public Utilities Bureau in the war zone</p>
<p>and the municipal facilities, as well as the privately-operated public utilities under its jurisdiction, suffered the disaster together, without exception. (A) Affiliated Agencies. (1) The North Shanghai Street Light Management Office. Office equipment was completely scattered, and street light materials were</p>
<p>partially lost. They were slightly supplemented. (2) The North Shanghai Advertising Management Office has been completely burned down. It is temporarily located in the North Shanghai Street Light Management Office as an office location. (3) The North Shanghai Vehicle Management Office. Office equipment and impounded vehicles that violated regulations have been completely scattered, and the houses have been slightly damaged. They should be rearranged and restored immediately. (4) The Zhabei Shipping Office. After repairs, it was moved in to work. (5) The Jiangwan and Wusong Street Light Management Offices. The houses were completely burned down. After the restoration of power supply in Wusong Town, houses were rented to restore the Wusong Street Light Management Office. Street lights in Jiangwan have not been fully restored and are temporarily managed by the North Shanghai Street Light Management Office. (6) The Wusong Vehicle Management Office and Shipping Office have rented houses on Waimalu and moved</p>
<p>in to work. (B) Municipal Facilities: Street lights, standard clocks, and public advertising areas (three items). (1) Street Lights. There were a total of 3,450 street lights in the war zone, almost all of which were damaged. Now, in addition to trying to restore them, many more are being added. The total number is now higher than before the war. (2) Electrical Standard Clocks. There was a master clock and five slave clocks in the war zone. Two slave clocks were destroyed during the war. They have now been repaired and are operating as usual. (3) Public Advertising Areas. There were a total of 1,558 meters, most of which were destroyed. After reconstruction, 957 meters remain. (C) Privately-Operated Public Utilities. The privately-operated public utilities in the war zone include the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, the Baoming, Xianghua, and Zhenru Electric Companies, and the Hutai and Songyang Telephone Companies. Among them, the Xianghua and Zhenru Electric Companies were not greatly affected because they were in the rear of the military operations. After the war, they were slightly reorganized</p>
<p>and restored power supply. The rest suffered serious losses or even fell to the point of being unable to maintain themselves. Over the past year, with the supervision and assistance of the Public Utilities Bureau, they have gradually recovered. The general situation is as follows: (1) Zhabei Water and Electricity Company. On the water supply side, it was maintained with all its strength during the war without interruption. The several trunk lines that were destroyed were immediately repaired and replaced after the war. On the electricity side, the poles and lines in the bustling streets have been sorted out. Currently, only the desolate streets of Zhabei and the Baziqiao area of Jiangwan have not been electrified because the scars have not yet healed and there are few residents. Therefore, reorganization has not yet begun. (2) Wusong Baoming Electric Company. Located north of Yunzaobang Bridge, which was a vital military location, the houses and machinery were extremely damaged and difficult to restore. The entire business area and franchise rights were then transferred to the Zhabei Company. The Zhabei Company is starting to sort out the poles and lines in Wusong Town and restore the power supply. (3) Hutai Long-Distance Bus Company. In addition to the lost vehicles, they have been repaired and resumed operation. (4) Songyang Long-Distance Bus Company. Destroyed almost entirely. The Baoshan County Government revoked its operating rights, and the Hutai Company took over the route. (5) Huashang Public Bus Company. After repairs and supplementation, it has gradually recovered. (6) Songyang Telephone Company. Completely burned down and impossible to restore. The Zhabei branch of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau immediately repaired and replaced the Wusong telephone poles and lines, and telephone service has been restored. (To be continued)</p>

The quota is 1,000 passes, and sales will be stopped when they are sold out. After the approval of the City Education Bureau, it will be implemented from August 1st.

<h3>The Story of the Hospital Donation</h3>
<p>Formal Donation Procedures Completed in September</p>
<p>Funding for Hospital Construction is in Sight. The Shanghai baseball field property on Route Père Robert, owned by the American oil tycoon Rockefeller, covers an area of more than 130 mu and is of great value. Recently, in response to requests from the National Shanghai Medical College and the Red Cross Hospital of our country, he agreed to donate the land unconditionally for the construction of a large-scale hospital and medical school site. This proposal is gradually becoming concrete. A reporter from Shenshi News specifically visited Dr. Yan Fuqing, president of the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road, who is in charge of this matter, to inquire about the progress. We now present a detailed account as follows.</p>
<h3>Origin of Land Purchase in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Rockefeller, the American oil tycoon, is a famous American billionaire with vast properties. Throughout his life, Rockefeller has been generous in his contributions to public welfare and charitable causes. Rockefeller established a charitable fund management committee in New York, hiring prominent figures to form a board of directors responsible for managing all charitable matters funded by Rockefeller. These are divided into various committees such as medical and educational, which carry out their work separately. Various parts of the world have benefited from his substantial charitable contributions. Many educational and medical institutions in our country have also received assistance from him. In the medical field, institutions like the Xiehe Hospital, Yenching University, and Soochow University receive substantial annual cash subsidies. Ten years ago, he planned to establish a large-scale hospital and medical school in Shanghai and Beijing. Therefore, he specifically purchased more than 130 mu of land located between Route Père Robert and the Observatory Road in Shanghai, paying more than 700 yuan per mu, to begin constructing the hospital site. However, due to political and other changes, the project came to an indefinite halt, and the purchased land was temporarily lent to the Sports Advancement Association for use as a baseball field and other sports venues at their request.</p>
<h3>Telephoning Rockefeller for Donation</h3>
<p>The Wusong National Shanghai Medical College was seeking a new site because its buildings were destroyed by artillery fire during the January 28th Incident last year. Later, the college president, Yan Fuqing, managed to temporarily construct two Western-style buildings on the vacant land of the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road to continue classes. However, the premises were small and insufficient. Moreover, the Red Cross Hospital was also expanding its services, and its wards, beds, and other acute medical equipment urgently needed to be expanded. Therefore, President Yan considered the vacant land in Shanghai owned by Rockefeller, which was originally intended for the construction of a hospital and school. He specifically requested that it be donated unconditionally to build another acute care hospital.</p>
<p>At the same time, the National Shanghai Hospital could also establish a more complete campus there. They jointly decided to prepare a detailed plan and telegraphed Rockefeller before the new year, asking him to generously provide assistance. After receiving the telegram, Rockefeller forwarded it to the Charity Fund Management Committee for review. After review by the board of directors, they agreed to the request because the land would be used for charitable and educational purposes.</p>
<h3>Replying with Approval</h3>
<p>At the end of last year, Mr. A. Gregg, Director of the Educational and Medical Group of the Committee, came to China to investigate everything. Upon returning to the United States, he reported his findings to the board of directors, who were satisfied with the results. In May of this year, they telegraphed back, expressing full agreement in principle and plan, with two conditions: (1) There must be definite funding for construction. (2) There must be defined operating expenses. If the above two items could be determined, the land would be allocated. After receiving the telegram, we began to raise one million yuan to carry out the construction and recently telegraphed Rockefeller, stating that there are already considerable means to address the two items raised. It is reported that after further discussion and resolution by the board of directors in August or September, the donation procedures will be officially completed.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Situation</h3>
<p>According to Dr. Yan's words to the Shenshi News reporter, it is almost certain that Rockefeller will fully agree to the donation of the land, which totals more than 130 mu. According to estimates by the Public Works Department, each mu is worth about 18,000 taels, for a total value of about 4 to 5 million yuan. It is planned to build an acute care hospital and a National Medical College site on the land. The construction cost is set at one million yuan, of which 800,000 yuan has been raised, and 400,000 yuan has already been received. The remaining amount should be raised in the near future. It has been decided that the hospital will focus on the treatment of acute illnesses, with the number of beds expanded to 500. The facilities will be as comprehensive as possible. The name of the hospital has been tentatively decided as Zhongshan Hospital. When building the new site of the medical college, the number of students and departments will also need to be greatly expanded. It is estimated that the college will need 500,000 yuan in annual operating expenses. In addition to the existing 200,000 yuan and continuing to request an annual subsidy of 50,000 yuan from Rockefeller, a subsidy will be requested from the China Cultural Foundation. In addition, a portion of the surplus land on the baseball field will be set aside to build civilian housing. The income from the real estate there will also help with operating expenses. However, the section on setting aside land to build civilian housing has not yet been approved by Rockefeller, but after our explanation by telegram, it should not be a problem. Therefore, the progress of the above plan is quite smooth. As for the start date of construction, it will be around August or September of this year, after it is formally approved by the Rockefeller Foundation.</p>

<p>Special Article</p>
<h3>Recent Living Problems of Japanese Primary School Teachers (2) Yuan () Ying</h3>
<p>For further clarification, the number of teachers in each salary bracket is shown below:</p>
<p>Salary Bracket Male Teachers Female Teachers Number</p>
<p>Below 30 yuan 38 44 30 - 35 yuan 1781 3733 35 - 40 yuan 1469 3571 40 - 45 yuan 3982 12753 45 - 50 yuan 8956 11483 50 - 55 yuan 13466 7424 55 - 60 yuan 10838 4688 60 - 65 yuan 9799 2694 65 - 70 yuan 8408 1648 70 - 75 yuan 6845 1040 75 - 80 yuan 5654 72 80 - 85 yuan 5029 458 85 - 90 yuan 4424 220 90 - 100 yuan 5106 161 100 - 110 yuan 3611 69 110 - 120 yuan 2529 11 120 - 130 yuan 1756 4 130 - 145 yuan 1253 None 145 - 160 yuan 560 None 160 - 180 yuan 344 None 180 or above 334 None Based on the "56th Annual Report of the Ministry of Education of the Japanese Empire," published in January 1933.</p>
<p>The above statistics refer to primary school full-time teachers, and do not include substitute teachers, assistant teachers, and specialist teachers who earn even less than full-time teachers. The above are official statistics from a 1928 survey, so the initial salary for normal school graduates was 45 yuan for men in urban areas (or 40 yuan for those earning less), 40 yuan for men in rural areas, and 35 yuan for women. However, since last year, it has been reduced by 5% to 10%. The current initial salary is between 35 yuan and 45 yuan, so it should be even less than the statistics above.</p>
<p>As the statistics show, we can clearly see that most teachers, both male and female, earn between 40 yuan and 65 yuan. Teachers who maintain their lives on this salary account for 67% of the total, and those with incomes below 100 yuan account for 92%. Even those who earn more than 100 yuan do not exceed 145 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition to this salary, there are also additional allowances, housing allowances, and bonuses. Additional allowances generally require more than five years of continuous service and recommendation from the principal and school officials. They add 24 yuan to 48 yuan per year, 48 yuan to 72 yuan for more than ten years, and 72 yuan to 95 yuan for more than fifteen years (above is for full-time teachers in the core curriculum), as well as special allowances for those in remote areas (less than 36 yuan per year) or single-grade schools (less than 60 yuan per year). But this</p>
<p>type of allowance is not monthly salary, so assuming the highest seniority allowance of 95 yuan is obtained, the monthly average is only 7 yuan and 9 jiao.</p>
<p>The so-called bonus is 20% of the monthly salary every six months in Tokyo, which is 1.4 months per year. Rural bonuses are given once a year, usually 10% to 20% of the salary, but some bonuses are only 5 jiao. Many rural areas have recently been forced to abolish this type of bonus. Housing allowances are 7 yuan per month for principals (in the old city of Tokyo; currently, Tokyo has greatly expanded), 4 yuan for ordinary teachers, and 2 yuan for non-homeowners. In rural areas, it is generally 2 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition to heavy daily workloads, Japanese primary school teachers must also participate in extracurricular labor for social education, such as youth associations and maiden societies (mostly fascist organizations). The same extracurricular labor pays 20 yuan per month for two days a week at youth training centers, while tutoring night schools</p>
<p>also pay 17 yuan for two days a week for core teachers and only 8 yuan for specialist teachers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, a middle-aged teacher in a single-grade school in the mountainous area of Iwate Prefecture once expressed the following sentiments:</p>
<p>"Children and their parents also bring vegetables to the teachers' residence, so we often look forward to them. What a humble mentality this is, but there are so many children, and life is really too difficult. Recently, there have often been undernourished children in this school. Women give them something to eat at lunchtime, and they are very happy. The misery of rural life</p>
<p>has reached such a point!"</p>
<h3>(3) Origin of Funding</h3>
<p>Originally, the salaries of Japanese primary school teachers were borne by the national or local governments. When the local government bears the entire cost, the teachers are directly governed by the local autonomous bodies as civil servants. When the national government bears the cost, the teachers are directly governed by national agencies (government, local government officials). The affiliation of primary school teachers was not much of a problem originally, but what they longed for was to be able to guarantee their salaries.</p>
<p>Looking at the rural expenditures (45.7% of the 1931 rural expenditures in the 1933 edition of the Agricultural Yearbook),</p>
<p>6% is used for school expenses, of which teachers' salaries account for 28.89% (133 million yuan). However, since agriculture, the source of rural finances, has suffered from panic, the above expenditures have also become a problem. Akita Prefecture plans to manage school afforestation to seek a source of educational funding, but without using the funds for purchasing seedlings, the current salary arrears problem cannot be solved. So, it is also a case of distant water not quenching immediate thirst. Since the countryside is so poor, the only solution is to find a way for the national government to bear the cost.</p>
<p>Regarding the national treasury's burden of teachers' salaries, the "Compulsory Education Expense National Treasury Burden Law" was enacted in 1918, with the national treasury spending 10 million yuan annually. From 1923, it was 40 million yuan, 70 million yuan from 1926, 75 million yuan from 1927, and 85 million yuan from 1930. Last year, another temporary expenditure of 12 million yuan was allocated to poor rural areas. However, the current state finances of Japan are not based on income and expenditure, but on expenditure and public debt as income, with the "gold" finance transforming into "paper" finance. Therefore, the current source of funds is also in a state of flux, where it exists if you say it does and doesn't if you say it doesn't.</p>
<p>The so-called Northeast Incident cost 72 million yuan in 1931, 252 million yuan in 1932, and the budget for this year is 161 million yuan, totaling 486 million yuan, a huge sum. Furthermore, the so-called confidential expenses are not included. It is unknown when this situation will end, and Minister of War Araki has proposed a three-year plan to expand the army's equipment at 102 million yuan per year. The Japanese militarists disregard people's livelihood and only seek to realize their militaristic ideology. However, Minister of Education Hatoyama is also striving for educational funds, or is cleaning up the army to greatly reduce military expenditures, or is Qing Takahashi, Minister of Finance, issuing more public bonds, and does not oppose the national treasury seeking a guarantee of primary school teachers' lives. However, given the current state of Japanese national finances, even if the national government bears the salaries of primary school teachers, the problem of salary arrears cannot be completely resolved.</p>
<h3>(4) Two New Trends</h3>
<p>Under these circumstances, Japanese primary school teachers are reflecting two noteworthy trends: one is leaning to the left, and the other is a fascist tendency represented by Ibaraki Prefecture.</p>
<p>The Akita Prefecture Academic Affairs Department has also established a policy to crack down on the ideology of teachers and students, and the rules are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Investigate the ideological system of teachers and students, create forms, and store them in the county. (1) Set up inspectors to investigate the ideological situation of teachers and students in the county.</p>
<p>(1) The performance of fairy tales and other scripts centered on teachers and students in the school, as well as the editing of alumni magazines, must be approved by the school authorities.</p>
<p>(1) The principal must regularly report the ideological trends of teachers and students to the county government in secret. Those who delay or conceal reports will be punished.</p>
<p>(1) Regularly hold lectures on ideology and conduct individual guidance to people of note.</p>
<p>Another trend represented by Ibaraki is the fascistization of native localism, represented by the Feixiang Association movement of Feixiang, Zhejiang teachers. Although this trend is still in its infancy, the fact that elementary school teachers are at the center of loving their hometown and that elementary school teachers participated in the Blood Pledge Corps incident proves that it has already manifested considerably.

<h3>Promoting Domestic Products Through Government-Citizen Cooperation</h3>
<p>— Yang Cang</p>
<p>Recently, the Shandong Provincial Government, local agencies, and people's organizations have established the Shandong Provincial Domestic Goods Promotion Committee, advocating for mandatory promotion of domestic products. All goods used by party, government, and military agencies and their staff throughout the province are limited to domestic goods. It is intended to set an example and foster good habits. This kind of government-citizen cooperation in the mandatory promotion of domestic goods is far more effective than simply relying on empty slogans and posters to promote domestic goods. It is worth remembering that since the establishment of the National Government, there have been meetings, official documents, and methods for promoting domestic goods, which can be said to have emphasized promotion to the utmost. However, there has been little effect in recent years. Government personnel have higher incomes and higher living standards, and all they seek is comfort and enjoyment. What time do they have to ask whether the items they use are domestic? It is said that "the higher the position of government personnel, the more they promote foreign goods." What a heartbreaking thing this is. They even abandon excellent local products and prefer foreign goods, thinking that it is advantageous. Recently, Mrs. Yu Yingjie talked about how there are many domestic products in China that cost less than half the price of foreign goods, the only difference being the packaging and style. If they were properly guided and improved, why would their sales be entirely taken over by foreign goods? Her words are even more insightful. The recent Shandong Domestic Goods Exhibition promotes domestic goods, starting with local products in the province, such as the colored glaze from Boshan and the crepe satin from Yantai. We should first promote them and distribute them to various places to expand the market for promotion. This spirit of government-citizen cooperation is highly commendable. We hope that other provinces will follow suit and that provincial governments will order county governments to do the same. If we can implement it sincerely and cooperate thoroughly, then the development of domestic goods is very promising.</p>

<h3>National Products in Qingdao</h3>
<p>— Natural</p>
<p>Qingdao is a key port in North China, favored by both climate and geographical advantages. In recent years, local people have devoted themselves to promoting national products, such as organizing national product companies and national product introduction centers, all of which are solid evidence of Qingdao people's sincere promotion of national products. The 4th National Products Exhibition, held on the 10th of this month, was jointly organized by the Qingdao Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Municipal Association for the Promotion of National Products, and the National Products Maintenance Association, bringing together various national product factories in Shanghai. A total of 132 factories participated, including 11 silk factories, 10 cotton factories, 6 knitting factories, 10 leather factories, 6 rubber factories, 5 electrical material factories, 10 appliance factories, 11 clothing factories, 12 cosmetic factories, 9 food factories, and 40 daily necessities factories. Among them, 109 factories were from Shanghai, 1 from Beiping, 1 from Yantai, and 21 from this city. There were two venues for the exhibition: one was the old site of the Donglai Bank on Tianjin Road, which will be the future Qingdao National Products Company shopping mall, with four floors; the other was the original site of the Fuju Donghuo Store on Henan Road, with three floors, both of which are very spacious. The assembly hall was located in the courtyard of the first venue, solemn, brilliant, and colorful. The meeting started at 10 o'clock, with the most enthusiastic advocate of the event, Mayor Shen Chengzhang, the North China educator Mr. Zhang Boling, and the organizer of the event, Director Chu of the Social Affairs Bureau. First, Director Chu delivered the opening speech, briefly stating that the significance of holding this exhibition was twofold: one was to introduce public awareness, and the other was to create opportunities for factories to improve themselves. Mayor Shen's address first stated that through this exhibition, the public can be informed of the goods, observe their likes and dislikes, so as to meet the needs, and correspond to supply and demand. It can also connect the agricultural, commercial, and industrial circles, so that they can study each other, strive for progress, so that the products become more refined, changing monthly and yearly. Mr. Zhang Boling's speech was very interesting. He said that engaging in the manufacture of national products is more useful than donating airplanes. Promoting national products cannot be successful by simply posting slogans and shouting slogans. Qingdao City had two major gatherings in three days, one was to relieve poverty, and the other was to rescue the weak, both of which are fundamental works. The competition and improvement of the manufacturers are like the sprint of the North China Games, and our consumers are like cheerleaders, helping the success of all producers. The audience burst into laughter. In addition, Wang Jie'an, the representative of the Shanghai National Products Touring Group, Ding Jingchen, the representative of the Qingdao National Products Company, and Yu Weiting, the representative of the Qingdao Chamber of Commerce, all gave speeches. After the meeting, the whole venue was visited, the layout was elegant, and the display was beautified. All the guests praised it, and there were many North China athletes who came. According to the statistics, the report shows that the total number of visitors on the first day was more than 74,000, and the total sales of goods from various factories was 18,435 yuan, which is really an unprecedented grand event in Qingdao.</p>

<p>National Products Introduction</p>
<h3>The National Product Handkerchief Factory that Dominates Southern China</h3>
<p>— Zhou Ling</p>
<p>Since China opened its doors and traded with foreign countries, all overseas goods have been concentrated in our country's markets, so the commercial war has become even more fierce. Good things will definitely win, and bad things will definitely fail. This is a definite principle. It is a pity that our country's industry has not made long-term progress. The goods that are imported increase year by year. Everyone likes to buy them, and the people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult. In recent years, educated people in our country have used the principles of machine industry to set up factories to manufacture goods in order to remedy the situation. For example, handkerchiefs, although very small, are widely sold. Men and women in society must have one, so handkerchiefs have become necessities. Unfortunately, what we usually see on the market are all from foreign countries. The benefits taken away by foreigners in a year are incalculable. Therefore, several Cantonese merchants, such as Ma Ao, Xiao Guihong, Wang Zijia, Wang Yulin, Huang Qin, and others, specially raised capital in the 21st year of the Republic of China and established Huada Handkerchief Manufacturing Co., Ltd. in Jiuhefang, Hong Kong. The factory is equipped with new-style machines, specializing in the manufacture of various handkerchiefs, and has been registered by the governments of China, Britain, and the Philippines, with the Three Sheep brand as the trademark. The selection of raw materials and the promotion of business are all handled using scientific methods. Since the products are good, the sales are expanding day by day. It is now calculated that the places where they are sold are North China and South China in China, and the Nanyang Islands abroad. Although the goods are manufactured quickly, they are still not enough to distribute. Although the 21st year only operated for four months, the benefits obtained were not small.</p>
<p>Now, the advantages of the factory are briefly described for reference:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding organization and management: The factory has a general affairs department to take charge of everything, and also divides it into nine sections: business department, manufacturing, decoration, storage, design, publicity, accounting, receiving and dispatching, documents, and general affairs, to implement the spirit of division of labor and cooperation.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding products: The factory aims at modernization, such as the beauty of decoration, the novelty of patterns, etc., which are constantly being improved to meet the trend of the times.</p>
<p>(3) Regarding research and improvement: The factory stipulates that a meeting of staff members of each section is held every Saturday night, and everyone can express their opinions on how to improve the work, and the best ones are adopted.</p>
<p>(4) Regarding business: The factory uses new-style methods to attract customers and promote goods, so the three characters of the "Three Sheep Brand" have really been deeply imprinted in the minds of the Chinese people, and have long been recognized by people in the community.</p>
<h3>The Efficacy of Golden Rooster Soap Essence, a National Product</h3>
<p>In recent years, foreign goods have been dumped in large quantities, which has greatly affected our people's livelihood. Taking only the item of soap supplies as an example, how many millions of dollars are leaked every year? Looking at the root cause, most of it is because domestic soap products are either priced too high, or the efficacy is too low, or the smell is bad. Therefore, imported goods can run rampant. Now, industrial giants Liu Heqing, Xu Chunfan, and others have made a grand wish to hire chemical experts at a high price, collect various soap raw materials, and use scientific methods to research them dozens of times before inventing the Golden Rooster brand soap essence with amazing efficacy. It is said that all users who have used soap essence have unanimously praised it, saying that it has strong detergency, does not damage fabrics, sterilizes and disinfects, has a fragrant smell, is easy to use, does not require procedures, and is priced low, suitable for ordinary people, better than all soaps and soap powders, it is really good news in the year of national products.</p>
<h3>Promote National Product Beverages</h3>
<p>— Yi Hong</p>
<p>A friend sent me a few bottles of foreign fresh orange juice. When I drank it, I suddenly had the feeling of "outflow of rights and interests." I was ashamed!</p>
<p>In summer, people need to drink drinks all the time, but drinking unclean drinks is dangerous of contracting cholera. If you drink foreign soda and fresh orange juice, you will give foreigners some more obligations!</p>
<p>Wuzhou Pharmacy produces various fresh fruit dew, which is made of high-quality fruits after disinfection procedures. There are more than a dozen kinds, such as lemon, Sydney pear, apple, grape, bayberry, etc. They taste delicious, quench thirst, and produce body fluids. They are economical and hygienic, killing two birds with one stone. This is a national product beverage that is worth promoting.</p>
<h3>Dialogue</h3>
<p>— Shi Shuli</p>
<p>The other day, A and B were chatting in the living room. A said, "Time flies so fast, and it's another hot summer. The clothes and all the supplies for the summer have not been prepared yet. I think I'll go to the foreign company XX to buy some summer supplies recently. Are you going?"</p>
<p>B said, "What, don't you know why our country has become so poor? It's all because our people don't like to use national products, but use foreign goods. Do you still want to buy foreign goods? It's hateful, really hateful."</p>
<p>A said, "Then, what do you think?"</p>
<p>B said, "I think all the supplies should be national products. It can not only eliminate the disadvantages of the outflow of rights and interests, but also make the country rich and strong."</p>
<p>A said, "National products are not as good as foreign goods."</p>
<p>B said, "Who said foreign goods are good? Foreign goods will suck our sweat and blood and destroy our country. National products are really good, both beautiful and strong."</p>
<p>A said, "Oh, I know. I will never buy foreign goods in the future. I will go to the China National Products Company to buy national products,..."</p>

<h3>Jealous Wife Kills Concubine Case</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>(1. Yang Shaoxiu, a superstitious follower of Mencius)</p>
<p>Yang Shaoxiu was a red person under Chen Jitang, a bigwig in Guangdong. His job was to be close to this Chen's adjutant in the internal affairs section. Since he gained the trust of Chen, the bigwig, and became one of the top red people, "red people have golden houses. Red people have beauties like jade," he had already built a foreign building in a certain Shijie street, so he had a golden house: With a golden house, he had to hide several beauties like jade. His wife, Huang, was a famous tigress, and she was not beautiful, so she was not worthy of being called a beauty like jade: If he wanted a beauty like jade, he had to make friends with several female friends of the opposite sex. Fortunately, Yang Shaoxiu was amiable and kind, and he made friends with those social flowers and female students, without putting on airs or throwing tantrums, so he won the appreciation of ordinary beauties like jade, and several of them wanted to go to the golden house to be a couple with Yang Shaoxiu. Yang Shaoxiu, the favored son of heaven, was red to the extreme, but he was as red as a burning charcoal ball, "When it is red enough, it turns to ashes," and in the blink of an eye, the red man was out of luck, "The bad luck came to India."</p>
<p>How did Yang Shaoxiu get into bad luck? He was too superstitious about Mencius. Mencius described the rich and powerful, saying "The beauty of palaces and houses," and then continued with "The service of wives and concubines," Yang Shaoxiu built a foreign house and wanted to marry a beautiful concubine, which was following the steps Mencius said. Furthermore, Yang had a gold house, but he lacked a son. Mencius also had two sentences to encourage concubinage, called: "There are three unfilial acts, and having no offspring is the greatest." Except for his wife, no one could say that Yang's concubinage was wrong. His father especially approved of his son's concubinage plan, because his son's concubinage would give the old man hope of holding a grandson. Yang was from Qinzhou, Guangxi. Yang was an official in Guangzhou, and his father still lived in the countryside of Qinzhou. It was rumored that his son had already taken a concubine, so the old man wrote a letter and sent it to Guangzhou, saying: "I heard that the girl Chen, whom my son has recently appreciated, is good in character and body. It would be especially convenient to take her as a concubine." Alas! The clueless old man Yang, the monstrous disaster, all happened in this piece of letter. How did the great disaster happen? It will be revealed in the second part.</p>
<p>Understand that inaction is not the right to survive.</p>
<h3>Ten Thousand People Compete to Say the Five Stars are Bright</h3>
<p>— An</p>
<p>A Tao said that it was too hot and wanted to buy ice to eat. A Li said that it was too hot and wanted to buy ice cream to eat. A Mei said that it was too hot and wanted to buy watermelon to eat. A Ping said that it was too hot and wanted to buy soda to eat... Our Mr. Wu and his wife, Ms. Zhang, produced so many men and women, not to mention the fragments, about a dozen of them. This small group of generals also had to make a family restless.</p>
<p>In such a humid and hot summer, it is as if being smoked and roasted, no wonder Mr. Wu's younger brothers and sisters all shouted that it was hot and wanted to find a way to relieve the heat. Mr. Wu loved his children very much. They all shouted that it was hot, so he naturally wanted to find a way to solve it. He said to his children very gently:</p>
<p>"My good babies, wait a moment, the sun goes down, the heat will be reduced a little, I will take you to a place, I guarantee you will not shout hot, now take a break!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, five bright and brilliant stars appeared in the sky, dancing up and down, left and right. At the same time, a large wine bottle suddenly appeared, and the bottle mouth sprayed out juice like a spring of sweet spring. Mr. Wu and Ms. Zhang were overjoyed, and quickly opened the rattan basket they brought, took out a dozen and a half glass cups, and told their children: "Quickly support and receive the sweet spring, drink it down, I guarantee that all the heat will be gone, and you will feel cool and refreshed, and it is good for your health!" Many children did as they were told and drank heartily. Everyone praised in unison:</p>
<p>"It's really good," at the same time, the public in the park had an extra bottle: "Beijing Five Star Beer".</p>
<p>That night, the five stars in the sky were still shining very brightly.</p>
<h3>Blind Dance</h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Because of Hua's invitation, I stepped into the dance hall that I had not been to for a long time.</p>
<p>Although this dance hall is built in an open-air garden, it is shrouded in the atmosphere of the night. In the hall, only some black shadows can be seen flashing. The musicians play muddy tunes, plus the noisy voices of people. Although Hua tried his best to praise it as a summer resort, I knew that Hua said this to arouse my interest. In fact, this field not only cannot arouse my interest, but also adds some troubles to my troubled soul. We cannot endure long-term silence, so we subconsciously go to the field to dance.</p>
<p>In the darkness, I called a dancing girl from a seat. Maybe because of my illness and not dancing for a long time, my body seemed to be about to fall down. When I danced unnaturally with the dancing girl to a place with light, I suddenly caught a glimpse of the dancing girl's face. Huh! How could one of her eyes be blind? I was surprised! But my mood immediately returned to its original state. I remembered the blind prostitutes in Guangdong that were reported in the newspaper. They were bought when they were young, and when they grew up, the buyers blinded their eyes, so that they could arbitrarily sell their bodies without knowing the difference between black and white...</p>
<p>···This kind of story is prevalent in this tragic era. The one-eyed blind woman who is dancing with me now. And all the dancing girls whose eyes are not blind but are equal to blind, they are oppressed by life, they have no soul, no freedom, they are the most pitiful people in this world! This evil social system!··· I thought, my head seemed to explode, and at this moment the music suddenly stopped.</p>
<p>Hua and I returned to our original seats. Hua had just stumbled around with a short, fat dancing girl. I asked him how the dance was? He just smiled wryly. I felt that he was tasting the spiciness like me!</p>
<p>The music was still playing muddily, and the shadows were still flashing in the darkness. I didn't want to approach our blind dancing girl anymore, and I walked out of the dance hall surrounded by turbid air.</p>
<h3>Morning Movement</h3>
<p>— Zuo Yun</p>
<p>One day, because I wanted to know what the morning in this city looked like, I went to the crossroads with sleepy eyes when the golden rooster first crowed.</p>
<p>At that time, the east was just showing a slight fish-belly color, and the street lights showed a timid and aging look in this dawn. I don't know where the majesty of the appropriate time had retreated to. Sometimes a speeding car passes by. Carrying the tired faces of men and women who have danced and gambled, they cuddled together and ran towards their destination.</p>
<p>At this time when the night has passed and the morning is about to replace the flow, all the sounds gather from all directions, as if telling the sleeping people that it is time to work again. The first to start moving are the vegetable vendors who are carrying heavy burdens from the suburbs to the market. They were panting and humming the tune unique to the workers: "Hang yo... Hang yo..." It came from afar: one after another, echoing in the clear and quiet air, as if it were music praising the dawn: it also seemed like a lament cursing life. They hurry, hurry, all the hope is waiting in the future, and at the same time this cry is also a sharp tool to promote the brightness of the future.</p>
<p>Then, many iron wheels "boom boom boom..." rang on the cement on every alley, and that was the movement of "pouring the old man". Their songs are loud and exciting: "Get up..." "Pour..." It resounded far and near. One by one, people with disgusted feelings got up, and they opened the back door with a whir, "Tong... Tong" The sound of the chamber pot falling to the ground showed that people were all energetic.</p>
<p>But it won't be quiet yet, all the people who want to move are also moving. There are more and more people on the road, and the public transport vehicles are also dragged from the tracks. The inside of the car</p>
<p>The belly was crowded with darkness, full of workers in short clothes, going to various places to catch their bread. "Shen Bao, News..." The shouts rang all over the place, and the old guns who were smoked black by the cigarette lamps shouted even more vigorously. This is the form of movement is universal, all people have his moving goal, hastily and urgently, as if all</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Hardships of Military Service; A Sickly Man Falls Behind</p>
<p>Sacrifice and Disarmament; Soldiers are Sentimental</p>
<p>On this day, the night was still very long. Zhao Ziqiang walked to the window and saw that the sky was still silver-gray. The stars were sparse. Several bright stars as big as the mouth of a cup, like small light bulbs, were sinking down lonely in the air. The cold wind in the suburbs was even stronger in the morning. It was like scraping people's faces with a thin edge. Zhao Ziqiang looked at the sky, yawned twice in the cold, and thought in his heart that being a soldier was really too hard. Getting up so early, calling that young girl to marry a soldier.... Zhao Dequan, yes! Liu Jinsheng, yes! A rude, short burst of naming came from the cold. He thought again, I don't want to be dissatisfied anymore. As a company commander, I get up calmly, put on clothes and shoes, wash my face and gargle, too freely. But what about their soldiers? As soon as the bugle rang, the first one was the squad leader who jumped up. Within ten minutes, even the bed had to be cleaned up, and then he went to the yard to gather and stand in line, waiting for the roll call. In these ten minutes, I just walked from the front of the bed to the window. I didn't pat my leggings, and I didn't button the buttons under my clothes. They are all people, and this is enough to satisfy me. Thinking of this, his heart became happy, and he tidied up his clothes. It was seven o'clock, and it was time to drill. At this time, the stars in the sky were gone, but the sky was only slightly bright. The mist that had settled last night still enveloped the entire playground and had not been completely cleared. People from ordinary middle-class families who came out in such cold weather, in addition to their fur robes, even if they didn't wear an overcoat, would wrap a scarf around them. But what about the soldiers? They only wore a broken fur coat on their upper body and a pair of cotton trousers on their lower body. It didn't matter if most of the fur coats had lost their hair. The unbearable thing was the cotton trousers. The cotton wool inside was almost always re-fluffed old cotton wool. How could there be any warmth? (140)</p>

<h3>Simple Stain Removal Method for Households</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>Household daily necessities, contaminated with stains, should have considerable knowledge. Now, I will introduce several stain removal methods that I have personally tested:</p>
<p>Oils</p>
<p>Regardless of the various oils used for machinery, food, makeup, etc., the main component of the contamination is the non-drying oil quality mixed in the oil. To brush off the oil stains, first wash with soapy water, and then wipe with Vaseline, and the oil stains can naturally be removed. If it is silk clothes, which are not suitable for washing with soapy water, you can buy some deer horn cream or magnesium carbonate, apply it on the stain, cover it with a piece of absorbent paper, and press it with heavy objects. After about a day and night, the oil stain can be completely absorbed.</p>
<p>Ink</p>
<p>The ink contains pigments and iron. Oxalic acid must be used to remove iron, and then bleaching powder to remove pigments. If it has been a long time, ammonia water can be used to wash first, and then alcohol to wipe, and then soak in water to bleach.</p>
<p>Ink Juice</p>
<p>The ink also contains pigments. You can wash it with warm soapy water first, and then stick rice grains on the stain and put it into water to wash.</p>
<p>Blood</p>
<p>Blood contains protein and pigments. First wash off the pigments with warm soapy water, and then wipe with pinellia.</p>
<p>Fruit juice</p>
<p>Fruit juice contains sugar and acid. First use ammonia water to remove the acid, and then use warm water to wash away the sugar.</p>
<p>Rust</p>
<p>Rust only contains iron, which can be removed by washing with oxalic acid or acetic acid.</p>
<p>Paint</p>
<p>Paint contains drying oil and pigments. Wipe with sesame oil first, then wipe with volatile oil, and then wash with soapy water.</p>
<h3>Summer Baths of Various Kinds</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>In the summer, various ailments tend to occur, so in addition to paying attention to food and drink hygiene and residential hygiene every day, special attention should be paid to bathing. However, ordinary people only know how to use medicated water and soap, and do not know which medicine should be used to treat which disease. Now, I will introduce the most effective and proven Chinese herbal medicines:</p>
<p>Peach Leaf Water for Skin Diseases</p>
<p>Boil two or three liang of sun-dried peach leaves in boiling water until concentrated. Wash once or twice a day. This is very effective for dandruff, rashes, tinea, ringworm, athlete's foot, hemorrhoids, boils, etc. The water temperature should not be too cold when washing; the hotter, the better. First, use a cloth to filter out the peach leaf residue.</p>
<p>Sweet Flag Water for Nerve Pain</p>
<p>Sweet flag, which grows by the water, has roots that can be used as a tonic. It is very effective when decocted and taken internally by people with eye diseases. If you dry two or three plants of sweet flag, including the roots and leaves, add a handful of soap pods and four or five pieces of golden fist leaves, boil them together until concentrated, and use a cloth to filter the water. Wash once or twice a day. This is very effective for people with nerve pain and rheumatism.</p>
<p>Fennel Water During Pregnancy</p>
<p>Fennel seeds are often used by doctors as a stomach-strengthening and wind-dispelling medicine because they have a unique aroma. If you dry the leaves of fennel and boil them in water, it is very suitable for pregnant women and people who are sensitive to cold to bathe in it often. Moreover, the spirit is also refreshed because the nasal cavity and oral cavity are steamed with the aroma of fennel.</p>
<p>Angelica Water for Liver Pain</p>
<p>Angelica is the main medicine for women to replenish blood. It has a strong aroma. It is generally used for stomach diseases, liver qi diseases, gallstone pain, leucorrhea in women, etc. Use three or four qian of angelica, two or three qian each of Sichuan lovage, fennel, and cassia bark, add two bowls of water, boil them into a juice, and wash with it. It can relieve pain and dispel wind.</p>
<p>Hundred Herb Water for All Diseases</p>
<p>This is the leftover medicine scraps when pharmacists sort out various herbs. If you have skin diseases, women's diseases, gastrointestinal diseases, hemorrhoids, etc., it is very effective to wash with it.</p>
<p>Mulberry Leaf Water to Remove Dampness and Relieve Itching</p>
<p>Use dried mulberry leaves, winter mulberry leaves sold in pharmacies, add a piece of alum, huangbai, and two or three qian of sparse prickly ash. Boil them in water and wash with it. It can treat chronic eczema, remove dampness, relieve itching, kill bacteria, and disinfect. It is very effective.</p>

<h3>More on "Pushing"</h3>
<p>— Feng Zhiyu</p>
<p>After reading "The Pushing of the Third Kind of Person," I have some thoughts: Indeed, the work of "pushing" is now intensified, and the scope is also expanded. Thirty years ago, I often sat in the third-class cabin of Yangtze River steamships, but there was no such energetic "pushing" at that time.</p>
<p>At that time, you naturally had to buy a ticket, but there was no such thing as "buying a berth." There was buying at that time, but it was another matter. If you were afraid of not having a berth, you would go down to the ship with your luggage early in the morning. There were all empty berths in the third-class cabin, with only three or five people. But it was difficult to put your luggage down on an empty berth. Here a carrying pole, there a bundle of rope, here a roll of torn mat, there a vest. Someone would run out and say that the position was occupied by him. But at that time, you could have a meeting, advocate peace, and buy it from him. The highest value was generally eight jiao. If you were a fighting hero, it would be easy to deal with. Just sit nearby without saying a word. When the gong rang and the ship was about to leave, these territorialists would grab their carrying poles, torn mats, etc., and run away to the shore in a puff of smoke, leaving the unsold empty berths, allowing you to leisurely put your luggage down and go to sleep. If there were more people than berths and there was no way to accommodate them, we would sleep next to the berths. The "third kind of person" at the stern of the ship would not "push" you. Only the people resting outside the cabin doors had to go to the third-class cabin to avoid the purser when he checked tickets.</p>
<p>As for people who didn't buy tickets, they would undoubtedly be "pushed." The procedure was to confiscate their belongings, hang them on the mast or some pillar, pretending to beat them. But according to my eyewitness account, it was rare to actually beat them. When they reached the nearest pier, they would be "pushed" up. According to the stewards, they could also be "pushed" into the cargo hold and transported back to where they boarded the ship, but they didn't want to do this because "pushing" them to the nearest pier meant they had traveled one pier. "Pushing" them one by one, although they suffered some hardship, they eventually reached their destination.</p>
<p>The "third kind of person" in the past seemed to be more benevolent than now.</p>
<p>The pressure of life makes people烦冤, and in their confusion, they cannot see the冤家 clearly, so they think that family members and passers-by are obstructing their path, and therefore they "push." This is not only preserving oneself but also hating others. When this kind of person becomes wealthy, they want to "clear the way" when they come out.</p>
<p>I am not nostalgic for the past, but I am just saying that the work of "pushing" is now intensified and the scope is also expanded. I hope that future wealthy people will not "push" me to the "reactionary" pier, then I will be very fortunate.</p>
<h3>An Elementary School Teacher's Opinion</h3>
<p>— Shen Shiyuan</p>
<p>Ten years ago, I embraced the dream of "saving the country through education" and declined the assistance of relatives and friends. I did not go into business, nor did I engage in "acting on orders" tricks. I buried myself in elementary school education. At that time, I thought that education was a "sacred cause," but after two or three years, I realized that it was not so. In the eyes of local officials and gentry, elementary school teachers were almost equivalent to begging 化子.</p>
<p>However, I relied on some meager property and did not rely on a salary of ten or twenty yuan to support my family. Although the tuition was often in arrears, I still continued my blackboard and chalk life. I thought that as long as the teacher was enthusiastic and the students benefited, then even if people regarded me as a 化子, my career was still "sacred."</p>
<p>Until recently, I finally realized that I had completely failed. The biggest reason was that the textbooks I used seemed to be mocking my "ideal" in unison.</p>
<p>Let's take the Chinese textbook as an example. I have used the Chinese textbooks of several major bookstores. I remember often teaching such a story: Someone was poor when he was young, but he was diligent and thrifty, and later he became rich and lived a very comfortable life. It is extremely appropriate to teach people to be diligent and thrifty, but ending it with getting rich and living a comfortable life makes it seem that the only purpose of diligence and thrift is money. The impact on children's thinking is probably not good, right? And when I taught such a lesson, I felt like I was sitting on pins and needles, unable to feel at ease. Why? Because I am both diligent and thrifty, but I don't want to get rich. Instead, I can't get my salary, and I am willing to pay out of my own pocket because I believe that the purpose of life is greater than getting rich. If I am right, then why do the editors of the textbooks say that? I was very confused and indignant. Secondly, I am an honest person and I don't like being glib. Moreover, I have seen that the hangers-on in my relatives' families are all glib people, and I hate being glib. Unfortunately, I often encounter short stories of the "Xiaolin Guangji" type of glibness in textbooks. And children quickly learn this set. Eloquence may be one of the so-called "talents," but teaching young and innocent children to be glib like in the marketplace is probably not in line with the purpose of education, right? Why do the editors of textbooks like such teaching materials? This made me very puzzled again.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I am not against the stories of Cat Brother and Dog Brother. But I believe that children should not be reading only stories of Cat Brother and Dog Brother after their intelligence has developed to a certain stage. Unfortunately, some textbooks, all eight volumes, are all about Cat Brother and Dog Brother from beginning to end. However, the first few volumes are small cats and small dogs (that is, the stories are simple), and the last few volumes are cats and dogs with more complex minds. Whenever I teach these, I can't help but suspect that these textbooks are specially compiled for Cat Brother and Dog Brother to read.</p>
<p>I have always had these doubts, but I have never had a place to ask. Now that I see several gentlemen saying that they want to criticize textbooks and also hope that elementary school teachers will express their opinions, although I am no longer an elementary school teacher from this year, my opinion may be used as a reference, so I boldly wrote it out.</p>
<h3>The Mistress and the Little Dog</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>When the National Crisis Conference opened last year, there was a comedy of demanding</p>
<p>the cancellation of party rule, and the result was that a certain gentleman's two crisp gongs and drums brought the scene to a leisurely conclusion: "There are only two ways to cancel party rule: first, the people automatically cancel it; second, the people revolt."</p>
<p>Now, some people have brought up the topic of "opening up political power," which is indeed much more moderate than "canceling party rule," so the same gentleman, without waiting for a popular revolt, has made remarks implying a willingness to open up.</p>
<p>But I think······ Oh! Writing to this point, I just realized that I have violated the forbidden regulations. The editor of Free Talk once advised people to "talk more about romance," how come I am talking about state affairs again? Damn it! Quickly change course, but I am not very "romantic," so let me tell a small story:</p>
<p>A mistress had a small key, which she used to open a small kitchen. In the kitchen was a small bottle, and in the bottle was a small piece of sugar. The mistress had a small dog, whose nature was very playful. It liked to grab the mistress's skirt and pull it.</p>
<p>The mistress took the small key and opened her small kitchen, taking out a small piece of sugar from the small bottle. The little dog looked up and wagged its tail. The mistress said: "Gaprisa Petrovna, you pull my skirt, now look at this piece of sugar, but you must not eat it."</p>
<p>The mistress put the piece of sugar back in its original place. The little dog regretted it, but it was too late. (From page 177 of the Collection of Foreign Novels)</p>
<p>The author of this story, Sologub, is a Russian novelist, not a Chinese satirist. This should be stated.</p>
<h3>I Also Talk About the So-Called "Four Treasures Series"</h3>
<p>— Wu Jiu</p>
<p>The opinions expressed by Mr. Wang He in Free Talk a few days ago regarding the so-called "Four Treasures Series" are very insightful, but his vision is somewhat limited to the cultural circle, and he has not noticed that the "Four Treasures Series" will be a commodity, and what he does not approve of from a cultural standpoint is actually the key to making a fortune in the future with a tenfold profit, which is somewhat lacking.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the bookstore's photolithographic "Four Treasures Series" is entirely "commercial in nature." Everything is determined by this "commercial nature." If you understand this nature, then what Mr. Wang He thinks is incompatible with the cultural nature can be understood in its consistency and mystery, and his high proposal to publicly select items and have scholars discuss and decide can no longer be hoped for.</p>
<p>For example, Mr. Wang He believes that it is somewhat insulting to contemporary scholars to have someone like Jiang Fusong, the director of the preparatory office of the Central Library, who has no common sense, select the catalog of the so-called "Four Treasures Series." But from a commercial point of view, the so-called scholars are not as capable of rallying people as the director of the preparatory office of the Central Library. Also, Mr. Wang He believes that book collectors may not have scholarship and should not ask their opinions, but should ask the opinions of scholars. But from a commercial point of view, it is not as good as asking the opinions of book collectors, because asking their opinions is tantamount to asking major customers. As for the so-called impoverished scholars, Mr. Wang He may think they are valuable, but in the eyes of businessmen, they are not worth a penny, and they will not pay a high price to buy books for collection. Furthermore, regarding the so-called "communication of international culture," Mr. Wang He seems to think it is too exaggerated, but from a commercial point of view, it should be exaggerated to be an advertisement. And if we deduce from a commercial perspective, we can also deduce what the so-called "Four Treasures Series" will be.</p>
<p>It will be like this: printed exquisitely, so book collectors will love it; sold at a very high price, so book collectors can boast that only a few of them have it in their collections, and the general public cannot see it; therefore, it must not be sold separately, so as to satisfy the unique interest of book collectors.</p>
<p>As for us poor kids who want to read books, we still have to honestly go to the library that houses the "Complete Library of the Four Treasuries" to copy it, just like now.</p>
<h3>Ordinary Things (24)</h3>
<p>— 𣽃 Guosun</p>
<p>The team leader meant that although Zhiguang's goal was to go to Zhazha Changxing, the mud workers were not completely staying at the Liu family's house, and maybe they were scattered from north of the Liu family's house all the way to Jiangwan Yanghang, so why did he have to go to the Liu family's house? If he took the small road from here to Dachang, and then walked eastward from Dachang towards Jiangwan, the danger would be reduced. It was only dangerous when crossing Zhongshan Road. Moreover, when he got there, it might already be dark without needing a mirror at all. When it was dark, it would be extra safe.</p>
<p>So Zhiguang accepted the team leader's opinion and decided to wait until after three o'clock before setting off, so that he would arrive at Dachang just in time for darkness.</p>
<p>However, in less than half an hour, a new situation unfolded: the foreman of Chenjia浜 received an order from the team leader: "Make rice at four o'clock, check all the completed materials at five o'clock, and prepare to set off with the whole team." And Zhiguang himself also received a letter from the team leader, who advised him not to go north today, and not to go east either. It would be better to wait until tomorrow to see the situation, because the situation was particularly serious, and the army was building fortifications on the north-east side all night long······ Finally, he also mentioned "the difficulty of transportation."</p>
<p>The so-called "whole team" meant that even those who were not on the night shift had to work. Of course, the situation suddenly became tense, presumably because there would be a fierce battle that night. So Zhiguang also suddenly felt new difficulties. He thought that if he didn't go to see those mud workers, he would feel very uneasy in his heart. If he went to see them, he would have to wait another whole day. However, he would delay the matter of providing assistance for at least another day! Finally, after many deliberations, he decided, according to the representatives' suggestion, to rush back to Shanghai immediately with them to find Yao Botang and try to make the assistance a reality quickly and sufficiently.</p>
<p>Their return journey was by the small road southwest of Chenjia浜, diagonally across the railway, and then into Zhongshan Road. They then walked carefully and cautiously south on Zhongshan Road for three or four li to reach the southern embankment of the New Dachang Bridge in Caojiadu. At this time, the Italian soldiers guarding the concession checkpoint were single-mindedly waiting for the order from their commander to close the checkpoint amid the yellow错. Zhiguang said sadly to the representatives:</p>
<p>"In the concession, we may be the last people to break into the New Dachang Bridge today!"</p>
<p>After four o'clock this day, Yao Botang had summarized the opinions of various companies in the same industry regarding the assistance to Zhabei into a conclusion, which was: "Temporarily perfunctory, and slowly deal with it." In other words, whether supporting or opposing, both were canceling the extreme attitude. Originally, these Alash-style people, with their big bellies and old faces, speaking glibly, almost always held this kind of attitude regarding all issues concerning the future of the nation. However, Botang was not entirely like this. In terms of his temperament, he was originally a descendant of a noble family who had not forgotten propriety and righteousness. In terms of his knowledge, he was indeed an engineer who understood the times. In terms of his assets, he was also a "bourgeois" who was half-declined and eager to revive. The combination of these three atoms created the new-style entrepreneur Yao Botang that we see in reality. Of course, he had always been unwilling to completely agree with the opinions of the general Alash-style entrepreneurs in Shanghai, especially since this time the assistance to Zhabei was related to both personal wealth and the nation! In Botang's consciousness, personal wealth certainly occupied an important position, but he was also unwilling to abandon the nation. Unfortunately, the interests of these two aspects often conflicted with each other, so when he understood from the conclusion that the negative proposals of his colleagues were too unwise, he held a belly full of considerations to find a way to reconcile the contradictions in his heart and plan a wise proposal. This was truly worth considering! However, without receiving the representatives' specific conditions, all kinds of proposals were inevitably aimed at nothing, so in the end, he had only one way to wait quietly.</p>
<p>When the progress lights were just on, Zhiguang led the three representatives. These three representatives first mentioned their initial hopes to Botang, then described the situation they had experienced in Zhabei that day, and then stated that they thought assistance trucks were better than anything else, so they hoped that the factory would provide as many trucks as possible. Finally, they said to Botang</p>

<p>Securities and Government Bond Trading Extremely Quiet</p>
<h3>Only August Futures Contract Active in the Market</h3>
<p>Market Sentiment Weakens, Falling Three to Eight Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange only traded August futures contracts. Market sentiment was slightly weaker, and new buying was hesitant. Therefore, trading was quite quiet. Besides a few settlement transactions, major players rarely entered or exited. Trading thus sharply decreased, and most were taking a wait-and-see approach. The market failed to open above 18 in the morning session. Since the military reorganization, prices have fallen from high to low. Afterwards, all bonds generally fell by a little bit. In the second session, retail investors sold off, and the market price fell slightly again. However, the salt tax was relatively strong. The market price eventually fell by three to eight cents. The total turnover was 4,276,000 yuan, including 1,000 yuan in spot goods. Futures included 1,750,000 in salt tax, 280,000 in demobilization bonds, 330,000 in 1921 bonds, 880,000 in 1931 and 1920 bonds, and 540,000 in 1926 bonds. The rest were in the tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands. Additional yarn and cotton will be auctioned today.</p>
<h3>Yarn Market in a Holding Pattern</h3>
<p>The yarn market is calm, with no significant gains or losses. The situation is stable, but actual demand has weakened again, and the slight drop in American cotton has softened sentiment. However, buyers are very firm, so the market remains in a holding pattern. Total inventory is still heavy, and chips in the yarn and cloth warehouses remain untouched, it is said.</p>
<h3>Human Stamp Slightly Weakens</h3>
<p>The opening market for human stamps was fairly good, but buyers were lacking in the second and third sessions. Each month fell by one to three cents. A total of 12,350 bales were traded. Sales included 450 bales of Sui Stamp, 400 bales of Xinchang Stamp, 650 bales of Senkang Stamp, and 400 bales of Changfeng Stamp. Purchases included 450 bales of Chunjie Stamp, 400 bales of Renfeng Stamp, 650 bales of Dachang Stamp, and 450 bales of Tonghe Stamp. The closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Zhenjiang 10, Hankou 10, Guangdong 20, Shantou 110, Fujian 20, Xiamen 30, Sichuan 360, Inland 65, Nanjing 15.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Lacks Momentum</h3>
<p>July old cotton, with the highest volume of short covering, was suppressed by ample factory deliveries. The reason is that yarn sales are sluggish, so how can raw materials rise alone? However, some was sold to Japanese merchants at a low price, with 10,000 dan purchased and delivered to the Japanese. Other purchasers were relatively few. Prices were only 4.5 cents higher than in June.</p>
<h3>Zheng Stamp Has Short Covering Recently</h3>
<p>The opening market for Zheng Stamp was flat in July. There was some short covering in the second and third sessions, resulting in a slight increase. The closing call was 49 yuan. Later, actual goods were sold at 8.6 yuan. Far months were weak due to good weather. The current month rose by 0.5 cents, and far months fell by 0.05 to 0.15 cents. A total of 39,300 dan were traded.

<h3>Spot Cotton Business Is Emotionless</h3>
<p>The spot cotton business is still sluggish. The source is estimated to be 100 bales of Yao cotton this year. 55.75 pieces of cotton, both domestic and foreign, are entering factories.</p>
<p>Tianjin: Woven cotton 0 cotton Dong: Entering pieces</p>
<h3>American Cotton Softens, English and Indian Continue Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially rose due to good news from Liverpool, but then fell back due to poor spot market conditions and a weak Wall Street. As a result, spot goods fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 6 to 13 points. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot goods rise by 10 points and futures rise by 4 to 6 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 9 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose following American cotton, but then fell due to profit-taking by longs. As a result, Pingar fell by 0.25, Omar rose by 0.5 ropis, and Bairoxi rose by 1 ropi and 0.25. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 25th).</p>

<h3>Grain and Rice Market Continues to Fall Slightly</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were over 40 sources, but the retail channels were still sluggish. Bao merchants handled a little more than one bag each of Tianjin's thin paddy. However, with more goods arriving, the market was sluggish. Merchants were still standing firm, but the middle and lower grades were slightly reduced in price. Yangjian rice remained soft, Dujian rice remained unchanged, and Bianyin rice also remained unchanged.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were about 20 sources from various rivers. The market for white japonica rice was flat, and the price of high-quality goods was stable. The middle and lower grades were slightly lower. The trend for thin japonica rice was fixed. Early rice continued to arrive and saw some retail transactions, and the market was weak. Yangjian rice was soft, Dujian rice was stable, and dock rice and white rice were also weak, it is said.</p>
<h3>Foreign Keng Rice Arrivals and Sales Are Both Slow</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrivals of foreign Keng rice were long overdue, and sales were also sluggish. There were no transactions in foreign rice or Keng rice throughout the market. Although there was some inventory of foreign rice, it was of low quality and old. There was only about 10,000 bags of Keng rice in the market, also of lower quality, which did not suit the tastes of local merchants. Merchants from Fujian and Zhejiang have recently shown some interest, but there are no qualified goods available. Except for some inquiries in the rivers and inland, they are mostly taking a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, only the Wenzhou merchants bought 220 bags of Wuxi brown Keng rice at 6.5 yuan per pound at the guild. There were no other inquiries, it is said.</p>
<h3>Flour Market Initially Firm, Then Weakens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially felt quite firm, about 0.1 cents higher than the previous day's closing price. However, in subsequent sessions, there was no movement in actual sales, and it was rumored that the Northeast would implement tax increases starting next month. If this tax is confirmed, flour sales will suffer another blow in the future, so sentiment turned weak. Large factories also sold off some forward contracts, so although the decline was slight, the market has turned weak. Looking ahead, only active actual sales can avoid another heavy fall. As a result, the current month was unchanged, August was up 0.025 cents, September was unchanged, and October to December were up 0.025 cents, it is said.</p>
<h3>Futures and Spot Wheat Fall Together</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw foreign wheat prices rise by 0.4 to 1.45 yuan in the morning. However, domestic wheat sales were sluggish due to poor flour sales. In addition, factories still had a large amount of foreign wheat, so they were not eager to purchase from abroad. Therefore, each month had to soften. By the afternoon opening, due to delivery of the current month, outside longs could no longer push back. The approximate actual delivery was estimated at 60-70 cars. It was heard that Fufeng would receive half, and the rest would go to retail investors. Each month was unfavorable due to the sale of contracts by dealers, and the market sentiment was poor. As a result, the current month fell by 0.04 yuan, August fell by 0.02 yuan, September fell by 0.05 yuan, October and December were unchanged, and November was down by 0.01 yuan. Spot wheat had abundant arrivals and inventory, but limited factory demand. Each grade was reduced by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Factory demand was sluggish, and the future trend is still softening. Gaoyou wheat opened at 3.7 yuan, second grade at 6.8 yuan. Jiangyan wheat was 3.72 yuan, Huangqiao wheat was 3.77 yuan, Yangzhou wheat was 3.6 yuan, second grade was 5.7 yuan, Qingjiangpu wheat was 7.4 yuan, Suqian wheat was 3.76 yuan, Yingying wheat was 3.67 yuan, and Xinghua wheat was 3.63 yuan. Over 7,000 bags were opened and purchased by Fuxin, it is said.</p>
<h3>New Mung Beans Have Been Launched</h3>
<p>Two batches of new mung beans from Shashi arrived yesterday via the Hongli Wheel, totaling 150 bags. The goods are clear and contain medium-sized hair seeds. However, the quality is not sufficient because the identity is as new goods, and there are many stiff grains. The cost is said to be over 5 yuan. Yesterday, Western merchants inquired about purchases, but only offered 4.5 to 6 yuan, so the buying and selling terms were far apart, and no sales were made, it is said.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Coarse Sand White Sugar Wants to Rise But Fails</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market rose due to the rise in customs gold and mark gold, and the trend was tightening. The guild quoted 20.02 yuan for ordinary grade crude sand, ex-warehouse, but buyers were only willing to offer 0.015 yuan, so no transaction was made. Good quality medium sand white, 20, was quoted at 19.8 yuan. KD branded Dutch red was quoted at 16.3 yuan, and the next grade was 2.3 yuan. The local factory had Chinese crystal ice at 25.2 yuan, a good increase of 0.2 yuan. Number 1 ice was 22.1 yuan, Number 2 ice was 22.9 yuan, and Number 3 ice was 22.2 yuan. Top grade cotton white was 19.7 yuan, Number 1 was 0.5 yuan, Number 2 was 0.3 yuan, Number 3 was 0.1 yuan, and Number 4 was 18.9 yuan. Taikoo sugar rose slightly. B brand was 20.6 yuan. Over 100 bags of local factory ice flower green were opened at 16.35 to 16.4 yuan, an increase of 0.2 yuan compared to the previous day. Chao merchants opened 60 to 70 bags of full top grade white sugar at 21 yuan. Over 200 bags of Hainan red were at 13.7 yuan. Jian merchants still wanted 17.2 yuan for Five Blessings white ice. Scattered transactions were made.</p>
<p>North and South Goods</p>
<h3>Xiamen Tangerine Peel Land Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Xiamen tangerine peel, recently the price of land has increased, the division application is difficult, the source is very few. According to yesterday's letter, the land price division application must be 28-29 yuan, but the Cha number plate has been to 27 yuan, so it is difficult to close. The sales will be strong, or may rise with the wave, it is said.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Chinese and Foreign Silk Markets Both Trend Weak</h3>
<p>New factories have successively transported Shandong Linqi and Zhoucun silk factories to start production in January. The process factories have now been successively transported for nearly half a month, arriving at 52 boxes.</p>
<p>The sales of rayon are increasingly clear and firm, and foreign exchange is tightened. The sales of rayon are increasingly clear. Yesterday, only Hangzhou and Shanghai merchants entered 25 boxes of August futures of Samsung Lady Junzi Head No. 1 Red Fish brand, with prices ranging from 179.25 yuan to 166.5 yuan net.</p>
<p>The silk sales in Shanghai are lonely and lifeless. Yesterday, the exchange market tightened, and foreign silk prices were depressed. Shanghai foreign silk sales were lonely. Although European merchants had nibbling mouths, the offer prices were suddenly small 40-50 yuan, and the factory parties generally did not want to sell them. The market atmosphere was sluggish. Yesterday, only Indian merchants entered eight packages of yellow silk and ten packages of gray silk, and the price was flat.</p>
<h3>The Sales of Zhenmei Tea in Wubei Have Already Started</h3>
<p>Zhenmei tea in the north of Wuyuan, Jiangxi province, has always been known for its excellent production methods. This year, it has also imitated the production method of Tunxi in Anhui province to facilitate sales to Morocco. The body is slightly better, and the selling price is also seen to be more than ten yuan higher. Recently, the road to Africa is active. Yesterday, Yihua, Baochang and other firms in the road also started to process it. The selling price is 135 yuan, which is slightly lower than before. The market in Tunxi, Wudong and other roads is also brewing. The prices of big gangs such as Gongxi Zhucha and other items are as stable as yesterday. Qimen black tea, due to the thin bottom of the inventory, Chinese merchants' asking prices are higher than before, and the market is absolutely firm.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods</h3>
<h3>Woolen Autumn Goods Already Have Transactions</h3>
<p>The weather is hot, so where can woolen goods be sold? But the great heat has passed, and autumn is coming soon. There have already been inquiries about autumn goods transactions. Hooded tweed and Walter tweed in the 34th stalls have also been sold. According to the theory, after the tax increase, the new tax on wool and cashmere, 780 per cent, is levied on weight. If you add six or seven cents, there is no doubt that the actual sales will increase. However, Yuan Chang blue-gray mixed color cloth</p>
<p>Because there is dumping of eastern goods, it is difficult to see good. Yesterday, Deji Kongshi No. 1005</p>
<p>The new price of number one riding breeches is 8.25 yuan, and the price of good Chinese brand is 6.6 yuan. Ningfeng Dafugui Walter tweed is 4.25 yuan, Deji Sihuotu yuan straight tribute cloth is 5.15 yuan, and Ruixing Tianyou herringbone suit tweed is 7.5 yuan.</p>
<p>Oil Market</p>
<h3>Hongxiu Tung Oil Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>The rapid rise in the price of Hongjiang tung oil is unprecedented in the past four or five years. In recent days, due to the sales order, each internal line has come to purchase it, and the rise has become more and more severe. Yesterday, each store in the area received an urgent telegram from Zhenjiang, saying that Zhenghong Jichanghe has sold off at 29.4 yuan per barrel. It is necessary to increase sales according to the application plate, then 30 yuan has been set in front of us. The prices of Fu Hong, Yang Hengyuan, and Qingyuanfeng are even more favorable, and the selling price is tightening. It is feared that it will be above 25 yuan. The rise is purely due to the lack of bottom and insufficient application. Xiutong Oil followed Hong Tung Oil for advances and retreats. Wanxing Yuda Youheng has recently opened over 33.56 yuan customer market, but only a few hundred barrels, and the goods have not arrived yet. I don't know what day the last arrival will be. Each family took only dozens of barrels each, and it felt more and more insufficient to be assigned. According to recent verification of the deposits in various places, it is feared that there will be an interruption in the supply of Hongxiu oil.</p>
<p>Hardware</p>
<h3>Small Ying Tin Remains Without Quotation</h3>
<p>Small Ying Tin is produced in Yunnan and transferred to Shanghai from Hong Kong, so it is mostly sold by Guangdong merchants. Recently, sales have not been good, Ning Shao merchants will not enter if the price does not fall, and Guangdong merchants are not willing to quote prices, so recently, most of the outgoing is local Fan Tiao tin, and the price is between 170 yuan and 180 yuan, it is said.</p>
<p>Coal</p>
<h3>High-Quality Dross is Currently in Short Supply</h3>
<p>The best quality of bituminous coal dross, such as Kaiping special dross, No. 1 dross, Huashui dross, Datong No. 2 charcoal dross, Zhongxing dross, etc., has recently arrived in very small quantities. The source of high-quality foreign coal is also scarce, so the prices are firm. For example, special quiet is 14 yuan to 0.3 yuan, No. 1 dross is 11 yuan, and there is no spot. No. 2 charcoal dross is 15 yuan, Zhongxing dross is 15.2 yuan, it is said</p>

<h3>Winter Mushrooms' Sister: Straw Mushrooms</h3>
<p>Straw mushrooms and fragrant winter mushrooms are both plants of the genus . But unlike fragrant winter mushrooms, they can be planted anywhere. The shapes are also different. Straw mushrooms are white in color, and the umbrella is thicker and smaller, and the stem is fat and thick, and there is no fragrant gas. But the taste is absolutely delicious compared to fragrant winter mushrooms, even better than them.</p>
<p>Straw mushrooms are produced in the northeast of a few provinces, of which Jilin products are the best. Among the Jilin goods, the ones produced near the ancient pagoda are the highest in body. Duolun, Inner Mongolia's Lama Temple is also good, the Eight Banners goods are second, and the outer Eight Banners produce the next. The levels of the goods are roughly divided. (1) The temple is large and self-generated, each one is selected, the color is bright and clean: the quality is 2 fat and thick. (2) 裏 Large Self-Generated: The color is bright: the shape is uniform. (3) Large Self-Generated; is the goods of the Outer Eight Banners, the next. (4) Jingkou Ding; (5) Beikou, large self-generated and below, the goods are inferior in body, the color is dim and black, and the shape is uneven. Therefore, the advantages of the best straw mushrooms are (1) the color is bright and pure; (2) the shape is round and neat; (3) the volume is plump and thick; (4)</p>
<p>Identity is dry. Otherwise, it is the so-called substandard goods</p>
<p>Straw mushrooms are loaded in grass bags from the place of origin. They are carried by camels to Zhangjiakou and concentrated; then in Zhangjiakou, they are repackaged in wooden boxes and strictly</p>
<p>Sealed and transported to various places for sale. The wooden box is square, and each box weighs about 40-50 pounds.</p>
<p>Straw mushrooms are the only treasure in vegetarian food, of course, the sales volume of temples and vegetarian restaurants is the largest. The most powerful people who transship from Shanghai for export are the Sichuan merchants, because the output is not large, but the demand is eager. So it feels quite valuable. At present, the market price per load is about 700 yuan for the top grade and 300-400 yuan for the middle grade. When it was most expensive one or two years ago, it sold for more than 1,300 yuan. This is inevitably a bit aristocratic. Straw mushrooms are a special product of our country. (Japan has none, France has military straw</p>
<p>Mushrooms, only have canned), but since the September 18th Incident, half of the northeast has fallen to foreign countries, what do people in the country think when they taste this delicious food!</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>On Women</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Some people say: Women are just things for men to look at. Suddenly, it seems that the words are too excessive, and there is a suspicion of insulting women, but after careful taste, it is not a deceptive statement. For example, the Chinese use flowers to describe women, and Westerners use birds to describe women. When it comes to description, it should be the matter of literary figures, such as Li Taibai's "Hibiscus is like a face and willow is like eyebrows" and Ibsen's "My little pine"</p>
<p>Rats", are all the same in different ways, describing Yang Guifei and Nora as very cute. However, what kind of "thing" are women in the eyes of men? It is already said clearly here, do you need to argue strongly?</p>
<p>To tell you the truth, since the era of the matrilineal society, women have been nothing more than flowers in the pot and birds in the cage of men. It was so in the era of handicrafts, and even more so in the era of mechanical industry. The only reason is that their productivity is weak, and the relationship of childbearing, so men take advantage of their weaknesses, enslave them, use them, and all life is taught to them to be given to men. "At home, follow the father, when married, follow the husband, and when the husband dies, follow the son", aren't these the definitions that stipulate that they are appendages of men? So they have to obey him, obey him, serve him, be considerate of him, comfort him, love him, love him, flatter him, and use their lips to caress him, and use their thighs to satisfy him, to pass on his lineage, and to educate his children for him. Therefore, they have to have a charming face. Therefore, they have food to eat and clothes to wear in life, and coffins and coffins in death. It turns out that women are such "things". In addition, the private social system has pressed her into various forms, so that they have the distinction of wives, teachers, Misses, girls, mother-in-law, elder sister, female workers, and prostitutes. They are private property, and they are also commodities. Especially in this year of national crisis, women are even more in the autumn of misfortune. Many people blame women for loving luxury and not being thrifty. The biggest accusation is that they are unwilling to patronize domestic products. As a certain old writer said; "As if women had entered the monastery, the national crisis would be saved." This is just as the history of the past dynasties has recorded, almost every time the country was destroyed, it was related to the beautiful women who were obsessed with the country and the city. Even "falling horse buns" and "sad eyebrows" are signs of the destruction of the country. In fact, it is not that the world will prosper without beautiful women, although every traitor or dying doctor cannot help but regard beautiful women as important as tens of millions of family wealth, but there are not many heroes who did not marry oriental beauties and use the four northeastern provinces as dowries. As for the gentlemen who scold women as "vampires"</p>
<p>"The family of destruction" puts on a stern face to maintain morality, and even scolds them for not being willing to buy two pairs of Chinese silk stockings a day. But they secretly admire women's thighs under the dim light, and the irrepressible lust caused by their foreign gauze and silk cover-ups is not also a vicious manifestation of this class of orthodox gentlemen and domestic product gentlemen? However, it is only that women who have been raised by men cannot help but let them scold them. In fact, this is exactly their pity.</p>
<p>The above said a lot, maybe another typical man will scold me for bowing down to the pomegranate skirt and willingly defending women. However, I ask myself that my proposition is extremely fair. In fact, if there are really no prostitutes who buy prostitutes in the current society, there will never be prostitutes who sell prostitutes. From wife to maid, they all exist for men's enjoyment, and the reason why they are so distressed is that private economy buried them in the fire pit. Then how can the enlightened and brave female comrades save themselves? In addition to actively seeking the creation of a new world, there is probably no other way.</p>

<h3>The Nighttime Feast in Qinhuai, Presented to a Gentleman</h3>
<p>— Kong Fanzhang</p>
<p>The sound of Sheng Xiao penetrates the painted curtain in the wind, and the red building is divided into rooms for the beautiful ladies. Qinhuai has always been a romantic place, and there have been heroes who love to play music from generation to generation.</p>
<h3>Late Night Lament</h3>
<p>Don't look recklessly,</p>
<p>The characters of the Central Plains are half withered.</p>
<p>I get up in the middle of the night to pick the remaining fire,</p>
<p>Sitting and reciting the Dao De Jing to calm the mind.</p>
<p>(Yet rewarded)</p>
<h3>Life is Green Mountains Everywhere!</h3>
<p>— Xue An</p>
<p>This happened two years ago. But the impression of this event is still deeply etched in my mind. The fact is this:</p>
<p>In the factory where I worked, there was a lack of specialized technical talent in mechanical engineering at the time. Later, a young Japanese worker was introduced by a technician. He was visiting China for the first time, and he often showed a surprised and astonished attitude towards Chinese customs and habits. After finishing his work, he often stood alone, as if pondering something.</p>
<p>"He is wandering alone in China. During his spare time, he must be missing his hometown," I thought.</p>
<p>"Friend, the pressure of the environment is really terrible. You left your lovely hometown for the sake of bread and came to a strange foreign country to find work. In your spare time, do you feel the dryness and loneliness of life in a foreign country and miss your hometown?" I asked him.</p>
<p>After hearing my words, he didn't answer me, just smiled slightly; he took out a pencil from his work clothes pocket and wrote twenty-eight characters on a piece of paper:</p>
<p>"A man should set his ambitions and leave his hometown, and never return until he achieves something. Why bury his bones in his hometown? Life is green mountains everywhere."</p>
<p>"Life is green mountains everywhere!" What a thought-provoking line of poetry.</p>
<p>Among us Chinese, who are full of strong hometown concepts, except for a few provinces along the coast, it seems that it is rare for people to go to other places to investigate or seek development in life. Some of them rely on the legacy of their ancestors and do the work of "guarding the family property" in their hometowns; others, although they have no fixed property and live a mediocre life in their hometowns, are also "safe in poverty" because of the saying "It's good to be at home for a thousand days, but difficult to go out for one day." Most people generally live with the idea of ​​spending their lives in their hometowns, and they are reluctant to leave their hometowns easily unless there is something unavoidable.</p>
<p>When others organize investigation teams and explorers, enduring hardship, to investigate and explore our land, we, who have always adhered to the principle of苟安(苟安: content with the present situation), of course have no interest in doing this kind of "foolish" work. Others have investigated our mineral, agricultural products, customs and habits in great detail, and we, who are kept in the dark, of course don't know. (And it is "beneath our dignity to know" - evolving from "beneath our dignity to do"). Others use force to rob our resources. That doesn't matter either, these things have nothing to do with us directly, so let them rob them!

<h3>On the Singlehood Society that Upholds Ambition</h3>
<p>— Pei Shan</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper, I saw that in High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, England, more than a hundred young people organized a bachelor club, which was spread as a novel event. It should be known that young people organizing singlehood groups, Chinese youth, had precedents long ago. Three years ago, students of Jiangwan Chizhi University already had an organization of a singlehood society. The reporter was also one of the founders that day. At that time, more than two hundred students participated, which can be said to be a great event for a time. The name of this society is called the Singlehood Society in Chinese, and BachelorClub in English. The society organization has a president, directors, clerks, accountants, investigation and other sections: all of which are produced by the general election. The work in the society is the busiest in the investigation section, because the section is responsible for investigating whether the members joining the society are 광夫(a bachelor). If it is found that they are married or have lovers, they must be expelled from the society according to the regulations and must be punished. The society is getting deeper and deeper. Young men should devote themselves to the country and should not marry and have children and live a sweet sexual life, because once a young person has a wife, he will become listless and prematurely senile. At the same time, morbid conditions such as corruption and decadence will also arise from this, and they will only know that they have a family and not a country, so they advocate a singlehood society so that ambitious young people can concentrate on saving the country without the burden of a wife. (2) Because the level of life is getting higher and higher, the youth economy cannot be independent, and it is not easy to make a living. It is not enough to support oneself. Moreover, modern women are vain and live extravagantly, and it is not easy to support them. Furthermore, under the feudal Chinese old family system, young people's marriage is not free and are subject to various family constraints, all of which are the main reasons for inciting young people to advocate singlehood. It is also the original reason why we organized the singlehood society that day, which was completely motivated by the times and social background.</p>
<p>Most of the main members of our singlehood society that day were third- and fourth-year college students. They were busy with their studies, so after its establishment, the society's affairs gradually became sluggish. Even members broke their vows and got married and pursued girls outside the school. Therefore, they were attacked by students outside the society, saying that the members of our society were all organizations that regretted women after being lovelorn, and that if all Chinese young people did not get married, they would create small citizens, and they were afraid that they would become extinct in the future, and there would be no descendants to avenge the country. This is a serious national issue. They also said that we are all sinners of the nation, etc. Because of this society, I had a lot of written lawsuits with my classmates on the school's bulletin board that day, and as a result, both sides wasted a lot of precious time! Later, our singlehood society also disappeared invisibly with our golden age school life! Some of the members of the singlehood society that day are now married and have children! And some are still single. The singlehood society, which was so prosperous for a time, has only left a youthful dream, which is always memorable.</p>
<p>Finally, I would like to introduce a few famous sayings from Professor Xia Jinlin of our alma mater, which served as the closing statement of the singlehood society that day: "Young men and women! If you think it is good to get married, then go get married. If you think it is good to be single, then be determined to be single. Follow your personal philosophy of life, not your curiosity and the ideas you get from academic theories."</p>

<h3>Reminiscences</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>This is still last year's fact</p>
<p>My friend Mr. Liu and I walked out of the cinema, it was already half past eleven at night. The heat of the day had not completely dissipated due to the night air, but the cool breeze was pleasant. Our footsteps were particularly heavy in the empty streets. Most of the colorful electric lights had been turned off, only Tearooms or Cafes were still open, waiting for the last batch of "mysterious" people unique to this "mysterious street." At this time, I mustered up my courage and said to Mr. Liu</p>
<p>"Let's go, let's go to that Cafe for a drink"</p>
<p>"Let's have ice cream, I'm terribly thirsty."</p>
<p>"I agree," Mr. Liu immediately responded, "but we have to go to a store with female waitresses, in order to know what the so-called young and beautiful female waitresses are all about."</p>
<p>So we stepped into the "White Russian" store.</p>
<p>As soon as we entered the door, those white-clothed "waiters" shouted "Guests!" and escorted us up the stairs, followed by giggling girls who led us into a "refined" room, followed by moving the screen and lowering the curtains, "Okay, now we finally got them." But I was worried, I had to carefully calculate my money, but it wasn't enough, I had to ask Mr. Liu in Japanese with a beating heart:</p>
<p>I said a sentence in Japanese, meaning "Do you have a lot of money?"</p>
<p>He said "Yes," so I was relieved, but I saw the "female waitress" sitting on Mr. Liu's body giggle at me for a while, followed by coyly saying:</p>
<p>(It doesn't matter, aren't you all rich?)</p>
<p>"Oh? You understand Japanese?" Mr. Liu was simply shocked, and my face couldn't help but be covered with a burst of heat: "Ah, she has broken our secret." So, in their soft and charming laughter, the girl who spoke Japanese bluntly made the decisions for us. We each had a ham and egg, and she herself wanted to eat a加次萊司(Japanese Curry Rice), in addition to half a dozen beers and a bottle of wine, of course, this was also for herself. So from then on it was eating, drinking, talking, laughing Shanghai dialect, Jiangbei dialect, Japanese, pidgin English, hugging, kissing, and cigarettes, cigars. Three hours later, we walked out of the store, Mr. Liu wiped his forehead and said to me:</p>
<p>"Ah! So this is the female waitress in Shanghai,"</p>
<p>I knew it.</p>
<p>This year's summer night, the "mysterious street" is naturally very different. But how much has it changed? I don't know, and my friend Mr. Liu will never know.</p>

<h3>Marriage and Economic Problems</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am now years old, a junior clerk in a foreign company, with a monthly income of more than twenty yuan, which must be deducted for car and other expenses, leaving very little. Sent home for family use. My father also works in a foreign company, with no property, and his income is enough to support himself. Several years ago, my family wanted to get me married. Because I knew that my academic ability was insufficient, I intended to study, so I refused. And I once said, "If I don't have the ability to be independent, I will never get married!" My family couldn't help it. Now that my mother has passed away, and no one is taking care of the family affairs, my father is eager to get me married, and replied to me: "Father can definitely find you a better job."</p>
<p>So my marriage can no longer be postponed. A few days ago, I even preliminarily engaged with a neighbor's daughter, and the wedding date is not far away. The required expenses were somehow made up, and now I am just waiting for the wedding date to arrive. But I worry that my old father is getting older and weaker, and I expect that he will not be able to help me for a long time. If I am unlucky in the future, and my business is still not developing as before, and it is difficult to continue my ambitions, and the expenses will increase in the future, and I will not be able to repay the debt, then the future environment is quite worrying. Furthermore, I am currently borrowing money to get married, and I have said before: "If I am not independent, I will never get married." Will this cause any loss of reputation to me? Will I be laughed at? Besides this, is there a better plan? Please don't mind the trouble, and answer in detail. I am very grateful! Sincerely, Huang Juefei</p>
<p>Answer: "If I don't have the ability to be independent, I will never get married," this is a slogan of modern youth. At first glance, it is not beautiful and pleasant to hear, but upon careful study, we can find its contradictions and inconsistencies. "Marriage" is originally a very natural thing. As long as the two sexes love each other, they can get together at any time. Now why should an irrelevant condition be added: "If I cannot be independent, I will never..."? Generally speaking, the surface reasons are: First, women's economy cannot be independent and must rely on men. If men's economic ability cannot be independent, then this family is extremely dangerous; Second, women's economy cannot be independent, and men's livelihoods are also very difficult. If men cannot get a reliable and permanent job that is sufficient to be independent, and rashly get married, their future will naturally be very dangerous. Therefore, due to these two reasons, it is advocated that men cannot marry without the ability to be independent. However, I want to ask further: Why can't women be independent? Why is the problem of men's livelihoods so difficult? If in another system society, the private ownership system does not exist, and no one has the idea of gains and losses and greed, and men and women all have considerable work to do, and can maintain a general life that is not much different, may I ask: When men and women in this society combine with each other, do they have to ask whether the man can be independent, and then add the condition "If I cannot be independent, I will never..."? Of course they don't! Absolutely not! Because their men and women can be independent in life, no one relies on anyone, and no one will have the panic of unemployment. They naturally don't need this kind of economic condition to prevent the family from breaking down due to economic problems in advance! So, after all is said and done, this problem is superficially a marriage problem, but in essence, it still belongs to the entire social problem. Since this problem is the entire social problem, we can only solve it fundamentally. If we don't get married because of economic difficulties, is this expressing submission to the oppression of society? The rich can have three wives and four concubines, why can't we poor people marry one wife? So you say that because of economic difficulties, you won't get married, this is a passive method, equivalent to giving up eating because of choking. And even if you don't get married, you still can't solve our poverty! We must solve our poverty by fundamental methods. It is completely wrong to use not getting married as a passive resistance!</p>
<p>For example: you say that you will never get married if you are not economically independent, then I have to ask you: When will your economic problems be independent? If you go to be a running dog of the oppressive class, and fatten yourself by dipping into their leftovers, or use other illegal methods to earn some property, you can solve this problem. If you do business step by step, no matter how diligent and thrifty you are, you will not be able to be economically independent in a hundred years! Not only can you not be independent, but judging from the current situation, if there is no change in this society, I am afraid that your life will only get worse day by day, and you will eventually end up with nothing. I ask you: Are you waiting for the society to change before you get married? This is of course an untenable argument.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think that the "marriage" problem, if you think it is necessary, you might as well "marry." As for the life problem, you should think about it from a larger perspective and seek a fundamental solution. And this solution is definitely not something that can be solved by being diligent and thrifty and finding a good job. This is just a way to treat the head when it hurts and the foot when it hurts. The so-</p>
<p>called fundamental solution is to start from the root of the problem. Of course, I am not saying that you don't need to be diligent and thrifty and strive to learn. It is very necessary.</p>
<p>Finally, the letter said that my father has raised a thousand yuan. Judging from your economic situation, this amount does not seem to be used. I think everything can be saved. Except for the necessary expenses, any unrealistic pomp should be abolished. The union of men and women is originally normal. The so-called lifelong events are all lies that feudal society uses to deceive people. Don't believe them. You should be casual and casual.</p>
<p>Finally, you said that borrowing money to "get married" will be ridiculed? What does it matter? If you think you are doing the right thing, why bother if others ridicule you? What is reputation or disgrace is also a lie! If you are so hungry that you have to rob something to eat, see if you still want reputation? One more thing to add, your letter seems to have a feeling of regret that you cannot rely on your father to enjoy a long and happy life. This kind of decadent consciousness is also absolutely undesirable!</p>

He was immediately diagnosed and treated. He was quickly cured. After that, he was lively and fat. He was safe and sound. Unexpectedly, in the recent month, his head suddenly became swollen. (The skin all around is soft) It is increasing day by day. Compared with the face from the ears, nose, and below, it has almost doubled. His body is getting weaker day by day. The pupils of both eyes are often sluggish downwards. His neck is raised with great effort. His diet is normal. His urination is smooth. Only his bowel movements are sparse.

<h3>Under the Traffic Lights (37)</h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>He helplessly walked back and forth on the side of the Malley Hotel. This was not to stalk the third concubine, but to pass the painful time. However, it was ineffective. The more he walked back and forth, the more anxious he became like an ant spinning in a hot pot. So he decided to go back into the hotel and shamelessly ask the tea room staff</p>
<p>The tea room staff, who are the best at finding out secrets, had already seen through his heart from Shi Qiao's actions. Shi Qiao had only made a gesture. One of them had already gotten up to tell him that the third concubine had looked at the room and gone out again. The gentleman who came with her was short, fat, and very happy! I don't know when they will be back. If Shi Qiao wants them to tell him the room number, just give them some benefits. He can open a room next door to the third concubine's room. Shi Qiao agreed to all their conditions. He sat there dumbfounded in the next room. Now his curiosity has exceeded his jealousy. Who is that short, fat, and happy person?</p>
<p>Soon, someone suddenly pushed open the door as if they were walking into their own room. Shi Qiao poked his head out to see that it was none other than Wang Hua. Wang Hua obviously looked a little embarrassed. He went to the wrong room. He couldn't help but laugh dryly a few times first, then stepped forward and held Shi Qiao's hand, holding it tighter than usual. He said;</p>
<p>"Shi Qiao, haha, I actually ran into you! Great! I have something to discuss with you! Ha, ha, ha!"</p>
<p>"Ha, ha, ha, great! Shi Qiao laughed forcefully. He fixed his mind and looked at Wang Hua's body all over. Short, fat, and very happy. Great, ha, ha, ha!</p>
<p>Wang Hua has always been an optimist. He never sticks to things or takes them seriously. When he learned that Shi Qiao had exposed his secrets, he was also straightforward, but he said nonchalantly:</p>
<p>"You are writing a detective novel of love! Shi Qiao, Mrs. Yang is Mrs. Yang after all. Anyway, she is someone else's! I think she is better to you!"</p>
<p>In this way, Shi Qiao's anger was not easy to vent. But without Wang Hua's consent, he pushed open the door and walked to the next door. Wang Hua followed behind with a smile. He said!</p>
<p>"She hasn't come back yet? Maybe she won't come back. I'm not the only one accompanying her tonight. Shi Qiao, we are all being led around by her!"</p>
<p>Shi Qiao saw that there was indeed no one in the room. At first, he felt a little relieved. As long as Wang Dwarf is also waiting in vain tonight, that's enough to make him feel a little comfortable. Later, when he thought of Wang Dwarf saying that he was not the only one accompanying her tonight, he felt that all his jealousy and anger were superfluous. But he, who has always been serious about doing things, could not help but feel</p>

<h3>The Metamorphosis of Future Films</h3>
<p>— Guang Dao</p>
<p>Predictions of the Development of Wireless Films</p>
<p>It is Not Impossible for Every Household to Own One</p>
<p>The things that will be stored away in the future and waiting for us to discover are truly ever-changing and elusive. However, this wireless film "Television," a mixture of radio and film, is already not far from us. Some say that by 1940, we will be able to have one in every household, sitting in the living room and turning the dial on the machine to watch sound films on the wall or a small screen. On the one hand, we are amazed at the omnipotence of science, and on the other hand, we are ashamed of our lack of inventive genius, and can only sit at home and enjoy the fruits of it.</p>
<p>From watching silent films to watching sound films, from playing phonographs to playing radios, we have already felt that a new century has been created in the past ten years or so. If wireless film succeeds in the future, wouldn't we be entering a new era again? According to scientists, the future wireless film machine will be roughly the same as the current radio, but there will be an extra screen in the house. When the show starts, just turn the dial on the machine, the sound will come out of the machine, and the image will appear on the screen. At the same time, it can be like the current radio, and you can freely pick up any wireless film station's broadcasts by controlling the length of the radio waves. According to David Sarnoff of RCA, in the future, every family can have a small theater, and we can watch plays, boxing matches, horse races, football, or listen to concerts at will.</p>
<p>This wireless film is not a new invention. Although it is still in the inventor's laboratory, it is gradually being completed and improved, and will soon be available for practical use. It is said that it is now possible to see some scenery transmitted nearby in two small telescopes, and the sound is quite accurate. In the future, if the range of scenery to be transmitted is expanded and the sound transmission machine is perfected, it can be made public to the world.</p>
<p>As for the future method of wireless film broadcasting, there are probably only two types. The simplest is the broadcast of sound films. When wireless film is completed in the future, broadcasting movies will not be a problem. This method is to collect important news from all over the world, create films, and when they are shown in cinemas, they can be broadcast to homes using television. Of course, all ordinary films can be broadcast by television. And this broadcasting method can be used to unite all cinemas to establish a central broadcasting station: the film is transmitted from the central station to each cinema. In this way, one film copy can be enough for hundreds of cinemas. The second method is to have special personnel collect the scenery from the place where an event occurs and broadcast it directly to cities, cinemas, and private homes all over the world. This is exactly the same as broadcasting a speech in a large gathering now.</p>
<p>After this news came out, many theater and cinema owners became worried. They are afraid that in the future, everyone will use a wireless film machine (Televisor) at home to play movies themselves, and there will be no need to go to the theater. But many people believe that a large number of people still like to go to cinemas and do not want to sit at home and play movies themselves. Ordinary people are used to staying at home and find it boring: they can meet many friends, see many people, and feel more comfortable in theaters or cinemas. The air in the theater is completely different from the air at home. After all, sitting at home can only see a part of what is broadcast, and everything around the theater cannot be seen. In this way, they still have to come out. On this point, I also feel that some people like to sit at home, of course they still sit at home; and those who can't sit still at home still have to come out. Otherwise, there are many people now who have phonographs and radios at home, but they still have to come out to play. Will they not come out in the future when they have wireless film machines?</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "A Woman of New York" Mandon Broadway</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>If We Have to Estimate the Existence Value of This Film</p>
<p>, then the performance of the male lead Robert Montgomery, in that light and lively mood, is very worthy of people's attention. His lively movements and quick expressions are difficult to find in other young American male actors. I remember that it seemed that a newspaper once praised him as the most popular young actor in the United States. His acting skills can indeed cater to the happy mood of noble audiences. His bright movements and dialogues can be used as recall material for them after tea and dinner. Therefore, Montgomery is after all a lovable child.</p>
<p>In addition, the name Sally Eilers cannot be ignored. Especially her collaboration with Gibson in "Good Luck" showed her success in acting. But the role she played here is not very brilliant, perhaps the plot limited her development, compared with the role of the small jasper she played before, she did not surpass her previous achievements after all. However, when she explained the murder process in front of the plainclothes police, she still showed her skillful technique.</p>
<p>But besides acting, what other achievements can we find? I dare not compliment, it is precisely the emptiness of the content that determines the mediocrity of the performance. I don't understand why the author of this film wants to make a protagonist the focus of the play, but the result is that Montgomery is singing a solo in a plot that is empty and without anything. At the same time, we know that the author's original intention is only to give the audience a light and refreshing summer reliever, but the form of comedy is not necessarily always easy. The smooth mood certainly cannot be as touching and profound as that of a tragedy, but good comedies are not completely unable to make people remember for a long time. Therefore, I think the biggest lack of this film is not paying attention to the ups and downs of the mood, like a white cardboard, it cannot make me feel personally. This comedy is of course overshadowed in all aspects compared with "Millions" or "The Flowing Years," and it is also not as good as the "Good Luck" mentioned earlier. Even in terms of Montage, although it is not too cumbersome, it is not economical. For example, the virtuous wife is written very insufficiently, especially the reunion on the ship should not have accidental tricks. As for saying that this divorced couple still loves each other, then we can't see it on the book besides the instructions.</p>
<p>However, in terms of content, if you don't care about its vulgar and boring shortcomings, then you can still find some unexpected gains. For example, the officials below the mayor actually discuss political issues in nightclubs, and the sociable nightclub owners can use their ability to reverse the situation, bribe and plead for favors, and use despicable methods to acquit murderers, which can all explain the darkness of politics and the deception of the law. Regarding these, the gentlemen who care about the world and the hearts of the people sigh</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Talking About "Eternal Regret"</h3>
<p>— Yi Ju</p>
<p>After watching "Eternal Regret," people feel that the products of Chinese small film companies have not yet embarked on the right path, which is very disappointing.</p>
<p>The opening explanation of "Eternal Regret" said that the purpose of this film is to promote science, (the general meaning is indeed so) but the plot performance is absurd and outrageous, and I don't know where the so-called "promoting science" starts? In this film, I only saw a few cars coming and going from time to time, and a few scenes of funny and ridiculous fights. I sat silently for two hours and walked out, feeling infinitely disappointed</p>
<p>There are many inappropriate things in the plot performance of "Eternal Regret": (1) The love life and separation of Yu Qing and Li Lian are performed from Li Lian's memories, which is not sufficient, (2) Yu Qing quarreled with the servants because of playing the piano, and even started fighting. Is this the true color of young people? Yu Qing is not a strong man, but he can fight against five or six people, who would believe it? (3) The theft of the pearl chain in Yu Qing's house is not so easy. How the thief entered the house is not shown. (4) Li Lian did not know that the old man was Zhi Qi's disguise, but she dared to boldly follow him and sneak into the secret room. Judging from the performance on the money screen, Li Lian is definitely not this kind of woman. (5) Zhi Qi started a conflict because Li Lian saw through the secret, and Yu Qing walked over and saw it, and even went up to fight with Zhi Qi. This is too unreasonable. What right does Yu Qing have to interfere with them? Yu Qing is not a chivalrous man. (6) Writing about Zhi Qi's invention of an airplane that can exceed the speed of ordinary airplanes by three times, and Guanghui's invention of missiles, did not explain the principle, making the audience feel inexplicable</p>
<h3>Miss Hu Die Touched by the Scene</h3>
<p>Rain also has a sense of past and present</p>
<p>The weather was terribly hot the other day. Coincidentally, "Spring Silkworms" was filming a rainy scene. On the photography scene, the fire hydrant was turned on, and artificial rain was falling heavily. For a while, water splashed and flew all over the sky, and the heat was dissipated. Director Cheng Bugao took off his shoes and socks and directed the work, his thighs covered with mud. Hu Die stood by and watched, and saw Gao Qianping and Wang Zhengxin walking back and forth in the rain to act. She remembered the situation when she was filming "Mad Current" last winter. At that time, the weather was severely cold, and everyone was shaking from being hit by this violent artificial rain. Touched by the scene, she couldn't help but sigh: Miss Gao and the others are really enjoying themselves, taking a shower on such a hot day: We were filming "Mad Current" last year, how could we be so comfortable!</p>
<p>Scattered Pieces of Spring Silkworms</p>
<h3>Doubts Caused By</h3>
<p>— Yan Bai Bi</p>
<p>丨Are Actors Who Are Suitable for Urban Themes Also Suitable for Rural Themes?丨</p>
<p>Mao Dun's "Spring Silkworms" is a work that exposes the collapse of rural areas.</p>
<p>I think the causes of "Spring Silkworms" are nothing more than: the original author grew up in the countryside and experienced the real sense of the collapse of rural areas, analyzed and investigated with rich social science knowledge, and wrote with active new literary techniques.</p>
<p>This "Spring Silkworms" is of course a valuable harvest in literature and art. Now, it has been selected as a theme by the Star Film Company, and director Cheng Bugao has started filming it. It will be more truly unfolded in front of a wider audience. I can't help but congratulate the word deeply.</p>
<p>But recently, from the star monthly magazine of the Star Film Company, I saw a few scattered pieces of "Spring Silkworms" that they had already filmed, but I instinctively felt that what "Spring Silkworms" described was not the collapsed rural area, but the urbanized rural area! Although this is a small matter about the background, the "unreal" of the small matter will also affect the overall effect. Therefore, I am worried about the guidance and actors of the entire film industry. Are directors and actors who are suitable for urban themes also suitable for rural themes? Are directors and actors who are used to urban life and have no real sense of rural collapse suitable for filming films with rural themes? Editor's note: This is a letter of opinion. I am now publishing it with an impartial attitude, and I hope to arouse the attention of relevant parties. Not Sensitive</p>
<h3>All Star Cast</h3>
<p>In the past year or two, the European and American film industries have been extremely embarrassed due to the impact of the world's economic depression. In order to recover the declining business situation, they had to use All Star Cast to attract the audience. Of course, whether this type of film can achieve good results is a question, but in the substance of the film, it did improve the level of performance</p>
<p>The sound blockbuster "Two Against One" (directed by Zhang Shichuan) that the Star Film Company is currently filming can also be said to be China's first All Star Cast film. Because in addition to Hu Die, almost all the stars of the Star Film Company are included. A new level of performance will be presented to us in the near future.</p>

<p>丨Gainsborough Film Company's film studio in Islington, London丨 Leaving the bustling streets of London, in that area of factories, warehouses and shacks, before the European War, there was a power plant that supplied the city's railway current.

<p>The American Lask Film Company purchased the land in 1919 and built a photography studio. In the next four years, Islington Photography Studio became the birthplace of excellent films. In 1923, they specialized in renting this film studio to other companies to make films. Phyllis Konstam, was then one of the outstanding stars of Islington. The following year, three adventurous London businessmen 丨Friedman, Saville and Balcon 丨 formed a new company and rented here to make films. Not long after, the Gainsborough Company was established, and this place became its property. By 1927. and installed radios to shoot sound films. In 1930. Unfortunately, the god of fire came and burned the tops of the two theaters to a crisp. In the spring of 1931, the reconstructed new-style film studio was completed. Although the design has been changed, the equipment on the second floor remains the same as the old style. The area of Theater No. 1 on the bottom floor is 6,264 square feet, and the theater on the upper floor is 5,244 square feet. The top floor is a platform, which is prepared for shooting outside, and there are three projection rooms inside; one is on the bottom floor, almost as large as an ordinary small theater, and there are two smaller ones underground.</p>

<p>丨Gaumont Film Company's film studio in Shepherd's Bush, West London丨</p>
<p>Gaumont in England is the same as Paramount in Hollywood. Hollywood's first film studio was in a farmhouse in a forest, and the result was the production of Paramount's large film studio. And Gaumont, in 1898, was only filming films in the Durvich Civic Cricket Ground. But now they already own the best film studio in England. (To be continued)</p>
