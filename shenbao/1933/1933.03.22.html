<h3>時評</h3>
<p>抗戰之前途　覽</p>
<p>最近宋哲元所部在喜峯口一戰。日寇以極重大之創挫。捷音傳來。舉國歡躍。彼氣燄萬丈之强敵。且亦自承爲自明治維新練兵以後。無此重大損失。此一役之悲壯鏖戰與光榮勝利。允足與一二八淞滬抗日之戰先後輝映。永留光輝於我史册。於此可徵我國今日非遂無艱苦卓絶肯拚死以盡其天職之軍人。亦非遂無可以一戰之軍隊。徒以自前年九一八以後。爲不抵抗三字影響所阻。遂使忠義之士。徒有撫膺長嘆。欲爲國効死而末由耳。</p>
<p>雖然。此一大捷。固足以一寒敵胆。一新國際之視聽。然而茫茫前途。大難尚多。此役之勝利。非遂可以阻止强敵侵略之步武也。吾人所引爲可慮者。恐此後抗日之部隊。仍爲各自爲戰。而無整個之計劃耳。我人非軍事家。固不知戰略之應如何運用。惟以普通人之目光觀之。此次宋部大捷。敵勢大挫。則乘此威勢。各路同時反攻。似爲必有之戰略。然而最近戰訊。喜峯口儘管激戰。而其他</p>
<p>如冷口如古北口如石河方面。皆入於休戰狀態。若一任喜峯口之單獨苦鬥者然。夫以一民族遭人侵略。寝且瀕於絶境。而彼處抗戰。此處坐視。若有病之人。不能靈活運用其指臂。又若銹鈍之機器。不能靈活轉運其輪軸。此種各自爲戰之抗爭。恐終將不免於爲日寇所各個擊破。一二八之事。可爲最近之殷鑑。</p>
<p>目前之事。究將如何乎。汪精衛氏日前在中央紀念週報告謂（時至今日。除了抵抗兩字。更無話說。）于右任氏在國府紀念週報告。亦謂（决不與敵人苟且妥協。寗爲玉碎。不爲瓦全。）中央之所昭示者旣如此明白而堅决。吾人固無所再容其疑慮。惟鑒於去歲一二八之血戰。始則爲孤軍之苦鬥。繼則爲不支而撤退。終則爲休戰議和。不旋踵而上海又復燈紅酒綠。恢復其偷閒之生活。吾人所鰓鰓過慮者。即懼蹈一二八之覆轍。蓋今日之戰。較一二八之戰更爲緊要。倘使不幸而亦仍如是。則熱河殆將永無恢復之一日。即華北亦詎能得一日之安枕耶。國人奈何弗思。</p>

<p>柏林　國家社會黨政府向國會要求獨裁權之說帖、現已發表、其中要求國會許現政府在執政時期内、或在一九三七年三月三十一日以前得行使獨裁權、此案准許政府頒佈雖與憲法抵觸之法律、及取消國會與聨邦會議、對於是項立法案及對外條約之管轄權云、（二十一日路透電）</p>

<h3>歐局安危關鍵</h3>
<h3>法國不反對參加歐洲四强公約</h3>
<p>英法總揆再度會晤</p>
<p>協定細則愼重磋商</p>
<p>倫敦　據今日巴黎傳來最近之、消息觀之英意總揆在羅馬之談話、確已有使歐洲時局轉佳之象、據巴黎消息、法意兩國現有接近之可能、聞法總理逹拉第與外長彭古今晚與閣員會商後、明日與英相等會議時、將告以法政府願贊助英當局在羅馬之工作、衆信連日談話、在歐洲各國國之邦交中、定可發生多大之良果、而不用武力之一再聲明、定可發生心理上極愉快之效力、藉以促成世人信任之恢復、據消息靈通方面之意見、法國準備參加互相商榷性質之公約、但同時法國必須有充分時間、以研究各細則云、（二十日路透電）</p>
<p>巴黎　英相麥唐納外相西門、今晨由羅馬抵此、總理逹拉第外長彭古均在車站歡迎、英相等即乘汽車赴英大使署、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>英法總揆</h3>
<p>磋商協定條欵</p>
<p>巴黎　英意當局在羅馬所擬之協定、其主旨乃以非戰公約之精神、謀歐洲十年之合作、此協定將來可擴用於海外殖民地協定内容爲依照國聨盟約之規定、修改和約、英法意允承認德國平等權利、許德國以命令改組其軍隊、與歐洲他國同一地位、奥甸布三國立將予以同樣待遇、此協定十年期滿時、苟未經早一年通告放棄、則繼續十年、今晨十時半英法總揆與外交當局集議於英使署、討論英意協定之條欵、雖法政府對於上述條欵、旣未承認亦未否認、伹半官方面以爲若干條欵尚須修正、及經極愼重之研究、法人輿論以爲此項協定、可引起歐洲之大變化、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>英報所傳</h3>
<p>公約草案大綱</p>
<p>巴黎　倫敦每日電差報所載墨索里尼和平新約草案大綱、今日已在此間獲得半官性質之徵實、據稱、該草案保證英意法德四國合作、以保持歐洲和平、其他國家亦可加入、祗須正式批准新約可矣、但新約十年期滿後、此等加入國家、無停止成延長該約之權、又四國承認德國應有軍備平等之權、而目下已届實行此平等原則之時、法英意三國爲謀新約發生完全效力起見、必須設法修改各項和約、查國聨盟約内本有此類規、定現間對於奥大利與布加利亞亦將同樣辦理、此外又聞草案内規定有關係各國、將在歐洲以外及對殖民地事務、試圖推行此中規定云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>成敗關鍵</h3>
<p>繫於巴黎談話</p>
<p>羅馬　英相麥唐納之接受墨索里尼計畫、此間一般人士殊爲滿意、視爲墨氏之大勝利、惟四强互相商榷性質的協定、今仍在肧胎時期中、成敗繫於法國允否與英意合作、以整理歐洲之和平、目前足爲合作之梗阻者、厥爲法意之齟齬、此由意人之心目中以爲意國未獲大戰中所應得者、及因法國協助南斯拉夫、並拒絶意國海軍與法均等之故、至於法德間之關係、意國力能勸喻德總理希特勒、英相力能勸喻法國、尚不足爲慮也、（二十一日路透電）</p>
<p>華盛頓　英相麥唐納及外相西相、明日將在巴黎與法國當局討論意相所提之計畫、此間人士對英法談話、認爲甚關重要、緣意國方面旣聲明墨索里尼所提之計畫、不以四大强國爲限、而英相麥唐納對於波蘭及小協商各國之未來態度、又極關心、故一般人以爲間題之關鍵、繫於巴黎之會晤云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法報唯恐</h3>
<p>失却牛耳地位</p>
<p>巴黎　法報仍從事批駁意相之計劃、謂法英談判固屬重要、但依此計劃難獲效果云、並表示法國不欲抛棄意國之建議、惟羅馬會議與今日英法當局在此之談話、必將爲久長談判之　矢云、至法國之意見、半官性質之時報曾作槪括之言日、本週杪已有一種新思想加入時局中、惟發展至何種地步、無人能知之云、（二十一日國民電）</p>
<p>巴黎　法國與論界對於墨索里尼最近提出之四强和平公約、仍舊態度寞落、並認爲不合時、一致加以拒絶、法報紙提出二大理由據云、四大國成立和平契約、各小國國極大損失、再則法國將失其歐洲政治上舉足輕重之勢云、法黎晨報稱、法國倘加入四國公約、則各小國將中止其贊助法國之熱忱、此即不啻在實際上减少法國之軍備、故法國旣經軍備之減縮、復剥奪各協約國之贊助則此後將一任强鄰之宰割而不得不一再讓步云、（二十一日國民社電）</p>
<h3>德國輿論</h3>
<p>同情意相計劃</p>
<p>柏林　意相墨索里尼所提計畫之眞正意義如何、此間不得而知、故德國輿論尚保留判斷、但謂四强合作之計畫、不自今日始柏林前亦主張之、特無人贊成耳、惟意相計畫、包括和平條約若干條文之修改、以及軍備平等原則之實行德國輿論關於此點、對意相頗表同情、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美國方面</h3>
<p>關懷歐陸大局</p>
<p>華盛頓　意相墨索里尼所提之計畫、大爲政界及報界所注意、惟國務院則謹守緘默、國務院深悉法德兩國、意見接近之困難、對意相計畫或視爲能以恢復歐洲和平、羅斯福總統以爲美國工商業之恢復、繫於軍縮會議及世界經濟會議之成功、即使一部份成功亦有裨益、因此羅斯福對於歐洲大局、至爲憂慮、美國軍縮代表台維斯、大約必與法外長彭古會晤云（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>小恊約國</h3>
<p>深恐摒諸一旁</p>
<p>南斯拉夫京城　此間政界人士、以意相墨索里尼所提出之四强委員員計畫、將巴爾幹小協約各、國（即南斯拉夫、羅馬尼亞、及捷克三國）摒諸一旁、故頗抱憂慮、并以爲此種政策、恐使國聨會各種機關、爲之破産云、（二十日哈瓦斯電</p>

<p>令銀問題在國會一加辯論也、目下關於銀問題共有四案、一參議員狄爾所提購銀發行新鈔案、二參議員惠勒所提以十六對一之比率重鑄銀幣案、三參議員畢德門所提購銀案、四修正擠拉士銀行法案减少金元中所含純金案、今日此四案均向總統詳細說明、至國會内開議期大約將在四月下旬、</p>

<p>正式通告遷延復遷延</p>
<p>海部發聲明安頓民心</p>
<p>華聨社東京通信　日本退出國聨之諮問案、仍在樞密院考查中、預定二十七日提出手續、分爲（脫退國聨通告文）（聲明書）（附屬文書）及參考文件等、共有二千餘頁、其中聲明書及附屬文書均述其政策、比較重要、節譯如左、</p>
<h3>聲明書要綱</h3>

<p>附屬文書所述事項、係屬退盟後之善後辦法、其内容節錄如左第一、退盟後國聨大會及行政會、今後兩年間在法理上雖有參加權利、事實參加者鮮、日政府决定不參加會議、第二、退盟後日政府應負擔之經費、按日數計算繳清、盡其義務、第三、在國聨服務之日籍職員、不必與政</p>
<h3>附屬文書</h3>
<p>府同其進退、自願退職者、政府將設法安插或救助、第四、退盟後對國聨各機關應採之處理方法規定如左、一對華俄及對歐美各國、以隱妥策略應付、力避肇禍滋事、藉此除去中外之不安、二國聨所屬之各種專門機關仍與合作、表示日本之公明、於日本有利、國聨大會與行政會帶有政治色彩、故不參加、其他之和平事業、事務上之連絡等仍繼續合作爲妥當、但是在此種機關若有於日不利者、即隨時取消合作、三委任統治委員會·公衆衛生國際事務局·國際航空委員會·國際水路局·海峽委員會·交通總會·鴉片中央委員會等、凡根據條約創設之各機關當繼續合作、四國際經濟財政政議與日本關係甚密切、參加爲有利、日本退盟後、仍使落合公使與津島財務官參加會議五國際勞働機關之條文、插在對德國和平條約第十三編、與國聨性質有多少不相同、國際聨盟帶許多政治色彩、國際勞働機關仍爲社會的人道的機關、對國聨保持很廣大之自治權、不但不該與决絶、反要與此機關合作、爲確保和平事業協力、認爲賢明的辦法、巴西與西班牙離開國聨當時、亦聲明與國際勞働機關協力蓋爲認此機關有特别性質所致、</p>
<p>華聨二十日東京電　日本退出國聨問題一延再延、二十四日亦說來不及、又云於二十七日提出手續、日民衆深信日政府不能從速處决、係因暗中期待英法出任排解但是英法至今仍靜如泰山、毫無出任勸解、消息國内生出各種謡言、人心甚摇動、由不安而悲觀、進而自暴自棄、日海軍甚憂其將來不倒於外而倒於内、今日以某高官談話形式、特發聲明安頓民心、其詞云（世界各國决不因日本退出國聨而封鎖日本、果然封鎖日本、海軍立即封鎖中國口岸、杜絶各國之對華通商、日本以强國貿易維持非常時之經濟、吃虧者爲英法美意等各國、各國自顧不暇、决不敢以封鎖政策引起第二次世界大戰、故無經濟封鎖、並無世界大戰、日本海軍進攻世界却威力不足、　退守亞洲領土之力量則有餘、聨盟或美國若干涉南洋群島則以實力對付、請國民不必過慮）云、</p>
<h3>軍縮會</h3>
<p>將進入新階段</p>
<p>總委員員明日重開</p>
<p>英計畫將提出討論</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十日日内瓦電　英國政府仍欲使軍縮縮議、由星期四起即對英國軍縮計畫作一般的討論、外相西門日内即抵此、一般人相信西門必向總委員會要求以特别程序、、討論英國提案、英國代表團不願英國提案分散於多數委員會之手故必堅求專由總委員會擔任逐條討論、英國代表團並欲各國政府對於各條、能於短時期之内表示意見、英國所以必欲軍縮會議迅速表示者、其心理自易了解、惟英國計畫提出未及一星期、各國政府能否滿足英國之志願、殊爲疑問、蓋多數代表團不獨尚未徵求各本國國防機關之意見、即英國計畫引起各問題、各代表亦未就政治觀點上詳加研究也、如此情形、欲其對英國提案迅即表示意見、恐太怱促、因此星期四總委員員開會時、仍不能超過一般討論之範圍、各大國對於英國計畫必願就其全部加以判斷、尤以星期五開會時、未嘗發表意見之次要國家爲甚、惟各國政府於徵求必要意見之前、决不欲表示確定見地耳、但無論如何、星期四以後軍縮會議將進入一新活動階段、</p>
<h3>美代表台維斯</h3>
<p>明日啓程赴歐</p>
<p>國民二十日華盛頓電　今日美國務院發表軍縮代表台維斯大使、將於星期四啓程赴日内瓦、途經倫敦時、將稍事勾留、與英當道一談軍縮新發展、按台氏原擬較早出發因墨索里尼忽有歐洲四國公約提議、故不得不展緩數日、俾與國務卿史汀生討論此事、蓋台維斯雖不參加歐洲和平公約之談判、而此種公約如成事實、對於美國軍縮提議不無影響也、又聞美政府將同時授權台維斯、在歐非正式討論戰債問題、惟台氏此行、是否携有新政府之切實軍縮提議、則尚無所聞、僅知羅斯福主張統加减縮、第除在選舉演說時之聲明外、尚未發表其他計劃、今日此間又接羅馬消息、墨索里尼之提議規定新和平公約有效十年、期滿後苟非有一簽字國聲明廢止、則將自動展期十年云、</p>
<h3>對軍縮新方案</h3>
<p>日本反對各點</p>
<p>路透二十一日東京電　英國首相之軍縮計畫、日本對之並不贊同、日本要求將日本之建議同加討論、海軍界對謂英國之安全建議固屬周密、然無理由、日本之遵守倫敦海軍公約、其期以一九三六年爲限、故日本反對該約展至一九三六年之外、日本要求修正華府公約與倫敦公約所派與之噸位、日本並反對在飛機母艦天空轟擊及陸海軍力諸問題未解决前、將每國軍用飛機限定爲五百架之議、</p>
<h3>議會閉幕在卽</h3>
<p>日政局之展望</p>
<p>東報痛論議會政治</p>
<p>謂不悟將自墳墓</p>
<p>路透二十日東京電　政界對於首相　籐藏相高橋將否在三月二十四日議會休會後因年老體衰辭職、頗多推料、或料政府不久將復歸入政黨途徑者、但據負責方面消息、目前内閣不致有何變更、縱有變更亦將增强内擱之國民性質云、</p>
<p>路透廿一日東京電　議會若不展長會議時期、則將於三月二十六日正式閉幕、</p>
<p>世界社譯東京讀賣新聞云、（上略）今届議議所給予吾人之印象、恰似一夢游病者失魂落魄之狀態、何以議會陷於如斯狀態中乎、夫議會之被世人所忘却、恐無有甚於今日者、今届議會開會至今、其無能無爲之狀態可謂暴露透骨、議會政治果已喪失其魅力矣乎、今日政黨方面、口頭盛倡擁護議會政治、而行動上則毫不努力以謀其實現、若此、則議會政治除自然治解之外、自無他路可走於此、吾人所欲問者、日本之政治尚得期望將來之安固乎、世界之不振、將世界各國趕入民族主義之城壁内、經濟方面政治方面之自給排他主義之傾向、日趨顯著、其結果乃誘致一國之政治於獨裁之形式、希脫勒之專政於德、墨索里尼之獨裁於意、固不必論、今則並自由國家之美國、亦在匡救時局之名義下、以向所未有之絶對權力賦與大總統矣、夫由世界的傾向而觀、議會政治之没落、固爲不可掩之事實、然在今日之日本、亦有追隨此傾向之必要乎、吾人信其絶無、且亦希望其無、然而吾國今日之政府政黨、固每有機會、即高唱立憲制度之擁護、然迹其行動、則適足以招致反對之結果、蓋彼等均放棄直摰率直之態度、對政治毫無誠心耳、如欲舉例、則觀政府政黨對於此龐大可驚之預算案均絶無反省之態度、即可知之、在今日情勢之下、議會當局如猶祇知埋頭於政權授受之第二義以下之政治行動、則民心之離貳將不可免、雖謂掘憲政之墓穴者即政黨自身可也、</p>
<h3>日本與荷蘭</h3>
<p>談判仲裁條約</p>
<p>路透二十一日東京電　現悉日本與荷蘭之仲裁條約談判、正在進行中、按荷蘭外相白克倫與日使齋藤若干時前曾討論及此該約中規定凡日本與荷蘭間對於法律問題或條約解釋發生爭執而不能以平常外交方式解决者、應請海牙仲裁法庭處理、而不提交國聨之國際永久法庭云、</p>

<h3>德國法西斯新内閣之産生（續）</h3>
<p>（德國通訊）　黄公安</p>
<h3>希拉忒新内閣政治之方向</h3>
<p>（一）一再解散國會</p>
<p>希拉忒自三十日被任内閣總理明令公佈後隨於三十一日召集第一次内閣會議、决定其政治之新方向、所謂實現第三國政策遂由是而産生、次經希氏之提議、謂議會不能組成政府絶對大多數派、當經根據憲法第二十五條、請興登堡大總統一再下令解散、重行改造此提案無條件通過、旋於二月一日興登堡根據憲法第二十五條條文、以頒佈所謂緊急頒令之方法、一再下令解散國國使議會民主政治之代表、又多遭一次不幸之摧殘、同時亦即表示現代德議會主義之没落、然而希氏的極端激烈的政治手段於此亦可見一斑、</p>
<h3>二實現兩個四年計劃</h3>
<p>此次希氏内閣總理上塲後、除一再下令解散國會、於政治上有積極及劇烈之變化外、尚有所謂施行兩個四年計劃爲最值得令人注意、第一個四年計劃、係要企　完全解放德國農民之痛苦、第二個四年計劃、專在努力攻破德國失業問題、總合此八年時期、當能恢復德國戰前（即一九一四年）社會經濟之繁榮及其國際之自由平等地位、</p>
<h3>三鞏固興登堡戰線</h3>
<p>鞏固興登堡戰線、也是目前新内閣的新口號、此種新口號的意義、大抵以爲處於德國目前四分五裂、百孔千瘡、不堪其破碎支離的政黨集團鬥爭的混亂政局之下、如羣龍無首、失去共同信頼之政治中心人物、此種不景現象、誠不知將陷德國於若何不幸中、希氏個人從前屢以個人獨裁爲號召、至今因國家情勢之不許、亦不得不放棄成見、而與巴何等聨合共同組閣、希氏現在且認爲尤其須要全國一致共立信心、組成興登堡戰線、全體受領導於興登堡指揮及旗幟之下、庶幾可免分裂及無謂之黨爭、而救國家之危局、</p>
<h3>四實行國家勞慟之義務服役制度</h3>
<p>德國自一九一八年歐戰失、受凡爾賽條約之限制、不准德國再施行强迫軍國民制度、（即全國青年凡滿十八歲者、即須入國家軍隊當兩年義務兵）而年來德國則又妙想天開、施行一種所謂國家勞働之義務服役制度、凡德國失業青年、尤其是大學生之失業青年可自由加入國家之社會建設的勞働集團（例如開闢及修築全國公路新開運河、開礦及房屋之建築等團體）工作、享受國家之衣食住供給、不得金錢之報酬、每日四小時工作、四小時受軍事體育之訓練完全形成一種軍營的兵役服務生活、但名義上則是美其名稱爲國家勞働之義務服役制度、蓋欲避免協約國干涉所致也、（此種所謂國家勞働之義務服役制度、先行於匈牙利、次及於奥國、現行於德意志）其目的爲一方面可以救濟失業工人、即實行所謂以工代賑之意他方面工作之餘、每人又須受四小時之軍事體育訓練、一旦國家有事、立即可成爲衛國干城之健將誠一舉兩得、可謂現代國家政策之新創造、尤其在中國目前社會、實萬分須要效法德奥此種制度、以救國家今日之危難、以促社會建設之實現、特此附誌數言、萬望全國人民加以注意、德國自前年施行此種可謂工兵制度以來、全國失業大學生及其他中學失業青年、自由加入工作者已逹二十五萬人左右、（記者有一大學德國同學、亦爲此種隊伍之一份子、常得面談此中生活之體騐、有趣得狠、他日有暇、當另爲文寄告國人、）現在新内閣對於此種國家之社會勞働義務服役制度、特别聲明、加以最大之努力提倡鼓勵與保護及維持、使將來能逹更好更善之青年組織、及擴充其人數至五十萬或百萬人、</p>
<h3>五嚴防左傾</h3>
<p>新内閣成立後、德國全國新聞記者、即往拜見内政總長、探詢其對内政策之意見、關於内閣對左傾態度表示若何應付、尤爲當時新聞記者所注意、内政總長輔力騎博士、當時對新聞記者的答復表示嚴防左派反動的意志、非常明顯與堅决、輔氏稱、如共産黨不聽内閣之警告、停止其挑釁及中央同盟罷工之宣傳、政府將以最大的能力、及最嚴厲之步驟與方法應付之、柏林警察實力或不足充分抵禦左傾工人之暴亂、將來或將德國鋼夾團人員編入、協助警察、共同保護柏林治安、此種計劃當然要給左派活動以甚大之打擊及威脅、</p>
<h3>六變更國會選舉法</h3>
<p>新内閣欲在將來國會再行選舉時、獲得議席之政府大多數派起見、實行變更國會選舉法、僑居外邦之德國人民、此後亦有選舉權、其餘地方上被選舉人數、亦有增加、</p>
<h3>新内閣合運前途之預測</h3>
<p>德國每經一次内閣之更換、即多出一次　人動聽而堂皇之官樣文章政綱、近年自有放聲機發明普遍應用後、則又有所謂政府放聲機演辭新標語及緊急頒令、前者是政府發表新政治意見、如不曰對某計劃誓以最大决心和最大努力積極求其貫澈實現、即曰政府已有相當把握等等、總之都是說得能夠給予國民以悅耳的動聽、和興奮的安慰、後者即爲内閣肅清過去之劣跡及潛勢力、或其他障碍與政敵之武器、此種雙軌政治手段、吾人在德國本已司空見慣其實政綱雖然說得漂亮、議會亦已實行解散、兩個四年計劃的新名辭、亦與俄國五年計劃後先輝映、究之種種新企圖與新願望、能否如希氏之所期、一帆風順、能得安然實現成功否、衡諸德國目前内外之環境、實令人發生絶大疑問、祗就失業問題而、言希氏欲以四年計劃完全解除失業痛苦、恐非易爲之事也、須知經濟恐慌之根源不只埋伏於德國一身、受累於外者旣烈且鉅、縱令希氏上塲後、或能以强迫經濟政策、使若干人得到工作位置但國外市塲之閉封、生産品之無法向外分銷、非希氏可能爲力、生産品不能推銷、則工廠定難生存與維持、工廠倒閉、發生失業之問題、此係當然之結果决難或免、防範左傾手段過於毒辣、能否使大量無産階級不生重大之反抗、或能更加引起尖化的左右兩極端派之鬥爭、其前途决難敎人樂觀、一旦希氏防左政策運用失當將能助進左傾勢力之增長、如是、即會養成希氏未來之勁敵後患、亦非絶對不是不可能之事、吾人試以前内閣斯萊爾爲例、當其上塲之初、何嘗不像事事大有把握、全國民衆的放聲機演辭較希氏絶無遜色、孰意横逆之來、在在出乎斯萊爾之所料、上塲未及八個星期、祇得五十四日之短命、閣台旣倒、事功何在、蓋主張與環境常多矛盾之地方也、况且現前之德國、經濟恐慌程度、已逹登峯造極時期、六百萬失業工人、嗷嗷待哺、全國大半數生産工廠皆已關門大吉、信用常起動摇、戰債亦未得根本解决、希氏一經登塲、全國同盟大罷工的威脅又如狂風怒號、國家財政之吃緊、去年預算不足之無法補救、稅收來源又日日减少、（一九二九年全國稅收得六億馬克、一九三二年祗</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>得三億馬克）此外、何堅向以主張資本主義爲前提、以擁護大地主及在資本家爲職志、但希氏却帶國家社會主義的色彩、在其法西斯黨之政綱原則上、雖係承認自由活動的私有財産主權的經濟　度、但實際上法西斯黨之要求、决不容大資本家之操縱社會經濟勢力、且主張要没收猶太人之財産、清算一切制奴、最後何堅主張多市利於工業團體、希拉忒多市利於中産階級與農民、至於巴本之政策黨然又不願離開紳士階級說、話此等同床異夢之畸形現象、蛇虎能否同謀、實多疑難總之、希氏新内閣所遇之時艱、及國家賦予之使命、以及羣衆渴求安全之迫切、實較以前過去任何内閣尤爲艱險與繁重、可謂處於非常嚴重時代、希氏雖有非常腕力、想不易渡此非常之難關、但尤有不易解决之大謎則爲三月五日國會之一再選舉、在希氏以爲此次國會選舉、自己有政府勢力爲其後盾、及政權之活用、對於將來競選運動、可以操縱一切自能增加彼黨選民人數、從而可望議會將來得組成政府多數派、共産黨將來要受政府嚴厲苛酷之制裁與束縛、不使選民减少、予左派以致命傷、此種陰謀、如能成功當然足以鞏固内閣地位、使希氏眞正可以實行右派之獨裁政治、否則國會將來若果仍然不能産出政府多數派、如是内閣命運、或不免又要發生或大或小之動摇、其前途爲禍爲福、未易定斷、然依記者淺見、希拉忒的確不失爲德國戰後十四年來最理想之政治人物、其在德國所受羣衆之推崇與擁戴、不亞於意大利之莫索里、就其本黨對协國國家而言、又爲最大之政黨、勢雄而政新、其地位似較斯萊爾等等演獨脚戲、當然不可同日而語、且希氏對外亦有相當威望對於德國戰後十四年來之解放、及反凡爾賽條約運動、亦可謂已經建過甚大功勞、今受總統信任及全國之擁護上塲組閣、勿論如何、希氏將來未能有一可能之長期職任可爲預料、</p>
<h3>結論</h3>
<p>吾人勿論此次希氏三頭内閣命運之爲禍爲福、要之實際上德國政治已係上執道之國家、雖然自從兩年來、國會幾經解散、所謂民主政治之議會主義、早已失去其功能與作用、國會形存而實亡、德國民主勢力没落之呼聲不斷地充滿於國内外輿論、但因德國憲法第四十八及第二十五條文、賦予政府有緊急獨裁處置國會之全權、故國會之解散爲憲法所許、决不能認爲非公或暴行、始終没有違犯法治之精神、至於内閣閣潮不斷之産生、自白呂寗以至巴本、由巴本以至斯萊爾、由斯氏以至希拉忒、其間輾轉遷易、政局雖係屢呈急變、政治方向常有轉移、意見鬥爭非常劇烈、但一切爭鬥勝負之决斷、皆以全國民意爲依歸、例如當全國輿論請求白呂寗氏出任組閣時、白氏固可應命而出、及其一旦政策不行、或環境惡劣無能爲力之時、一經民衆之呼籲、白氏、即又急以政權還諸國人、解職以退讓賢者、就此次斯萊爾之内閣而言、斯氏上塲不及八星期、一旦覺得政治無把握、便即立刻提出辭職不敢戀棧、貽誤國政、總之其政治之轉移、皆以憲法爲根據、而以政治道德及人格爲中心、是故國會固可不絶解散、閣潮固可時時發生、但社會生活、直接上决不致受任何之傷殘或陷害、此種法治之良好現象、誠值得吾人之萬分敬佩與羡慕、反觀祖國每經一次政局之變幻、即多一次内爭流血慘象之暴露、政府動向之轉移皆以武力爲中心、而以内戰决可否、曾不知政治道德與人格爲何物、絶未脫開野蠻部落時代之人性、今者如川戰、兩劉之爭、究竟爲誰辛苦爲誰忙、此種純粹以個人利益爲前提之内戰、誠是中國民族沉淪自滅之唯一因素、東顧西望、見人見我、何中西政治道德相去若是之遠、因時感事、又不覺多增一重中國政治黑暗之苦、（完）</p>
<h3>國聨特會之重行召集（上）</h3>
<p>主席希孟氏致開會詞全文調解失敗由日本獨負其責</p>
<p>日内瓦通訊、爲中日糾紛而召集之國聨特别大會、自去歲十二月九日暫時休會後、即由十九委員員根據盟約第十五條第三項從事調解然日人衷心無意於此、且利用年關大舉進犯熱河、雖經過長久之折衝、不惜委曲遷就、而迄無效果、乃不得不根據盟約第十五條第四項、起草報告、嗣以報告起草竣事、爰於二月二十一日重行召集持别大會、報告調解失敗之經過、是日下午三時半、仍由比外相希孟氏主席、旁聽席人爲之滿、蓋羣衆心理、頗欲一聆日代表松岡洋台之狂論也、而孰知主席致開會詞後、即行散會、託詞與各國政府以充分時間研究、報告草案延至三日後再開、實則先發制人、在未討論報告以前、不與日人以反對之機會耳、開會辭譯如下、</p>
<p>（適纔余請諸君注意、特别大會於上次十二月九日開會時、曾訓令十九委員會將調查團報告書及中日雙方之聲明書、乃至在大會席上所表示之意見、加以研究、並草擬提案、以求中日爭議之解决、而以該提案在最早可能期、内提請大會考慮之、</p>
<p>十九委員員在完成此項工作上、茲已擬就草案二件及理由書一件、表示繼續追求本爭議之解决之努力、應大致採取何種根據、該草案及理由書等、已附在報告書草案第十二頁及以下各頁、當無須余</p>
<p>再爲讀誦矣、</p>
<p>查此項文字或至少兩草案之接受、欲其有效、應得大會全體包括中日雙方之一致通過、故余意在得中日兩政府之接受之前、實無庸將該草案等提交大會討論、此意十九委員會固亦贊同之也、</p>
<p>十九委員會已授權秘書長及余本人、即進與中日雙方代表團進行會商該項文字之送逹兩代表團、尚在十二月十五日、其進行會商、則開始於十二月十七日、會商情形、十九委會及其所組織之起草委員會、當然隨時得有報告、</p>
<p>中日雙方代表對該項文字、均主張修正、而日本代表團第一次提出之修正案、範圍旣廣泛性質尤殊異、故十九委員會欲向大大提出草案、而使大會全體會員包括中日雙方之接受、顯極困難、</p>
<p>然十九委員會仍願在可能期間内、努力進行、使雙方政府、尤其日本政府得有充分考慮該問題及提出新提議之時間、故十九委員會即於十二月二十日决定延會、最遲至一月十六日重開、俾與中日雙方之會商仍可進行無阻、</p>
<p>本年一月初旬山海關被佔據、日本所認爲（滿洲國一）一部之熱河亦有被攻之勢、致會商形勢、忽現悲觀、一月十六日十九委會重開時、日本代表團、並無新提議、僅稱在四十八小時中、當可提出、然十九委會仍决定再加等候、而不願即將數月來努力、付諸流水、</p>
<p>日本政府之新提議遲至一月十八日始送逹於委員會、然此項提議、非特爲中國抑且爲委員會本身所不能接受、惟日本代表團於提出新提議時、特别聲稱日本政府對該提議中反對非國聨會員國加入解决本案一節、最爲重視故十九委會即通知日本代表團如日本之所反對者、僅爲此點、則進與中日雙方再作談判、以求解决、亦尚非不可能、十九委會其後與日本代表團繼續討論、亦即以此爲根據者也、</p>
<p>日本代表團於一月二十一日表示即使議案中延請非會員國加入解决本案之一節、加以删除、日本政府亦未能接受委員會之文字、日本代表團作此答復時、並代表其政府提出新提議、然十九委員會之問題、雖遭日本（否）字之答復、仍未拒絶研究此項新提議、同時當然對中日代表團之修正案亦加考慮、於研究考慮之後、深知欲提出一能爲雙方接受之解决方法、至少在此時、實爲不可能、中日代表團及委員會本身、對延請俄美兩國參加交涉、視爲十分重要、自不能僅因日本之請、即將該項條文删除、而同時更依照日本提出之意見、對草案中各條加以修正也</p>
<p>在此種形勢之下、十九委員會即根據一九三二年三月十一日大會决議案、决定依照盟約第十五條第四節之規定、開始草擬報告、</p>

<h3>關稅互惠恊定滿期廢止</h3>
<p>日方似表示同意　中國不顧續訂彼方亦無權勉强</p>
<p>新聲社云、昨據本埠日公使館發言人與新聲社記者談話時表示、日方已同意廢止五月十五日滿期之中日關稅協定附件内所規定之甲乙兩部、（即互惠之規定）中國旣不願續訂、日方亦無權勉强但協</p>

<p>嗣後開洪更進一步、擬將陳謀斃、免其再處塵世、有累已身、乃於某夜乘陳熟睡之際、用菜刀向陳頭部、猛劈一下幸陳已經驚醒、急用棉被蒙住頭面、未遭毒手、當時陳大呼救命、開洪唯恐爲隣人察覺未曾繼續加劈、事後陳尤恐遭怨乃子、故亦　忍、不將此事發揚、閱數日、開洪見謀殺不遂、卽將陳驅逐出外、陳遂向上海地方法院呈訴開洪不顧贍養、而平日虐待之事、仍不揭發、旋一度傳審、結果奉判、仍着開洪贍養、並判令每日給予零用洋兩角</p>
<h3>躡足下手</h3>
<p>自陳重返子家、開洪益形怨恨、平時稍拂其意、卽遭責打、而陳卒念父子之情、隱忍不發、不料前日開洪又與楊氏秘密商議、將陳再度謀殺、幸爲陳得悉、卽於當晚九時許、託故出外、渡浦來南、擬赴其友人處商議辦法、陳走後開洪恐其已知秘密、報局請緝、乃頓起一不做二不休之惡念、立卽糾同胞弟小狗、髮妻楊氏、懷藏粗大蔴繩一根、利刀一柄、跟踪來南躡足於陳之身後、俟其步抵相當地點、下此毒手、而陳實不覺此撫養長成之親子、追踪其後、欲取其老命、故步行如故、</p>
<h3>繩頭猛勒</h3>
<p>未幾、行抵施家衖、地處僻靜、開洪等卽一擁上前、先用利刃、向其後腦猛劈一下、陳受痛極、呼啊吓一聲、聲尚未終、開洪等復用蔴繩套於其頭、用力猛勒、當時陳不及　察謀殺者何人、但聞其媳楊氏在旁、邊呼拉拉、快點拉呀、須臾陳不能呼吸、手足不得動彈、開洪等見狀、知已逹到目的卽將其棄諸路畔、卽渡浦返家、事後爲人發覺、施家衖内有一老者爲人謀斃於該處、立卽據情投報該管一區一所、請爲查究、</p>
<h3>蠕動返魂</h3>
<p>易所長聞報之下、以事關人命、卽飭警長藍玉成馳往施家衖、查察得陳氣息已無、惟其體尚温暖、急卽將其緊繞於頸項間之蔴繩解去、並使以人工呼吸、未幾、陳忽返魂、手足蠕動、警長知尚可救、立卽車送上海醫院、救洽之下、得慶更生、陳遂向警長泣告前情、警長以天下竟有如此之事、乃將其帶人所中、由所長預審、復於昨日上午八時許、撥派長警、按址前往浦東、將開洪小狗楊氏等三名口、一併拘案詰問之下、開洪等以此案之發覺、實出意想不到、故無不驚惶失色、惟矢口否認、當飭暫留、一面再行派警到浦東調查其四隣、據其四隣云及開洪等、平日行爲、極不正當、卽楊氏亦屬一有名實貨、前在某工廠内作工時、卽與一工人姘識、當其在十五歲時、卽已私生一子、警等卽據情回報易所長、以陳開洪等如此忤逆、胆敢謀殺尊親、不法已極、卽飭備文、於昨日下午四時許、申解市公安局、從嚴審究、當昨日上午十一時許、陳因一早尚未進食、未免飢腸轆轆、乃出資託人購得大餅三塊、正擬進食、忽見其子開洪等禁於拘留所中、時值响午、知其難得午膳、腹中必然飢餓、乃忍飢將大餅三塊、送至拘留所中、令其子媳分食、乃開洪等摇首示否、雖勸之再三、仍不接受、頓覺悲從中來、老涙奪眶而出、所購大餅、亦難以下嚥、遂棄之不食、噫舐犢之情、何其深耶、爲人子者見此文、更宜作何感想、</p>

<p>爲讀書而引出的風波</p>
<p>本埠趙勇誠君訊</p>
<p>我的家是居住在萬山重重的一個鄕村裏，在那裏，一切封建勢力以及舊禮敎現在仍是很完全的保存着·在這種惡劣的環境之下，舍妹才六七歲的時候就被父母依了媒妁之言，許配給本鄕的一個劣紳的兒子，到了民國二十年春，對方就要求結婚，這時舍妹才十六歲，在小學五年級念書，她的未婚夫是十七歲亦同樣在小學五年級，這時因爲他們變方的年齡都太小，所以我的家裏的人都竭力的反對，然而對方的家長的腦筋實在太頑固了，再四再五的要逼，非卽結婚不可，但我家也同樣的堅持着，後來對方又另說：（結婚不過是形式（？）上的表示，）在結婚以後仍許舍妹在家繼續求學，至是我的父母被迫得没有辦法只好妥協了，但事雖如此，而舍妹却寗死不從，幾乎自殺了，但是一個才十幾歲的女孩子如何能够反抗得了啊！後來終歸被迫而屈服了·在結婚後的最初；對方也還敷衍前言允許舍妹回家求學，不料去春舍妹小學畢業後，决心繼續入中學，於是乃徴求對方意見，而對方却絶對反對，并以無力供給爲却詞，我們也再四再五的去向對方的家長說明種種情理，并且申明不要他經濟上半分的供給，只求他一句允許，但是對方終歸固執不允，而舍妹求學之心又很切，不論如何不願屈服，没有法子想，於是我們乃毅然决然的由余領着好到省城投考省立女子中學投取後卽入學校肄業，這樣的一學期過去了没有話說，不料今春對方却一點理由不說出來而要求離婚，在過去雙方都是很和睦的只不過求學的意見上有些分歧而已，而此次舍妹來省也純係爲求　而來，絶對没有一絲格外的意見，且舍妹在學校裏對於女子應保守的人格也是絶對保持着的，而現在對方竟突然要求離婚敬乞指敎我們應該怎樣解决此問題？并希指示下列的幾個疑問：（一）</p>
<p>現在彼等夫妻間的感情已完全消失了，若不與彼離婚今後舍妹勢必遭受虐待，若用和平方法不能求得和好時應如何才能使舍妹今後的幸福有相當的保障？（二）以上面的事實而論，在法律上誰的理由比較充足？（三）若對方逼迫至非離婚不可時，應該如何應付之，并且可否要求相當的青春損失和離婚後的生活贍養費？這在法律上有什麽條件和限制？專此敬上恭候賜答。</p>
<p>答：據足下來信，所言，令妹只因求學問題，致與婿家齟齬，婿家旣然要求離婚，若果衡量不可終身，便趁此離婚，倒是好事，這是一，記者不是法律專家，第二問題，不敢率爾而對，但準諸情理而論，若果令妹眞如足下來信云云，毫無他項有傷品格之事，當然曲在婿家而不在令妹，理由當以令妹爲充足，這是二，照普通情理說，甲方提出離婚意見，自然要對乙方負相當贍養費或身分損失費；乙方提出離婚意見，對甲方亦如之，至於法律條文如何，則有律師在。</p>

<h3>爲（幽默）默憂</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>蕭伯納的英文原音是伯訥蕭，倘使譯作（包倷笑），便可從他的名字　　表現他的幽默色彩。</p>
<p>自從（包倷笑）老頭子，一到上海，二到北平，三到東京，幽默的名詞差不多家喻而户曉了；但，恐不是幽默之福吧！我倒很有些替幽默的前途默憂呢。因甚默憂　幽默？待我舉出兩種理由來：</p>
<p>一，社會上不求甚解的人，每易望文生訓，强作解事；以前的（浪漫）名詞；被人家誤會作（軋姘頭）（偷婆娘）（水性楊花）（狂嫖濫賭）等種種解釋。近來的（摩登），（模特兒），又被人强解爲風騷女子，不着褲兒的姑娘，照此比例，幽默二字流傳在社會上，一定會失郤眞意；將來　也許現在已有人討論這幽默二字；道一句：（幽默者，在幽暗中默坐之謂也。）不然，又道一句：（幽默，即油抹之諧音也。）從此以訛傳訛，幽默成了個甚麽東西呢？這是我默憂的一端，爲着幽默本身而默憂。</p>
<p>一，處在現代言論絶對自由？的我國，有没有這環境允許我們效法（包倷笑）一流人物而大放厥詞？事實告訴我，很有幾個效法那幽默的（包倷笑，）結果只有（逢彼之怒，）正在幽默自賞的當兒，來了一個（默須幽）　（註）的罪名，而幽默地（請君人甕）的時候，不是笑啼皆罪，幽默都非了麽？這又是我默憂的一端，爲着效法幽默老頭子（包倷笑）的人而默憂。</p>
<p>（註）默須幽，諧音便是莫須有。</p>
<h3>□□□□</h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>賣關子</p>
<p>「□□□□」這幾個方框擋兒，在說，因寅申一冲，辰戍一尅，在民國二十二年，該走鴻運流年。</p>
<p>方框擋兒，在内地小規模的報紙上，是家常便飯，不足爲奇。譬如有一個面熟陌生的字，排字房恰巧没有這個鉛字，於是老實不客氣，請方框擋兒當一下全權代表。</p>
<p>在上海幾家大規模的報紙上，有時也要玩這一套。但是在方框擋兒下，往往夾屁股就有一個括弧，中間註着（電碼不明）四個字，表示這是無可奈何的事，用不到請讀者原諒的。</p>
<p>但是這幾天報紙上，正走鴻運流年的方框擋兒，一不是鉛字不備，二不是電碼不明，說起來，來頭大，却是日本人敎我們的乖。</p>
<p>事實是這樣的。當淞滬抗日的時候，中國報紙上很忠實的報告着某軍在某地，某司令部在某方。他媽的，報紙出了不到一時三刻，日本飛機已像生着眼般的飛到某地某方去下炸彈。</p>
<p>起初大家還不懂，只當是日本間諜本領大，給探得了秘密。後來有一位日本倭奸說，這麽編新聞，日本軍隊裏，簡直可不用間諜。把中國報一看，按圖索驥，不亦樂乎。</p>
<p>吃一次虧，學一次乖，所以這幾天關於前線戰事消息的電報中間，都裝進幾個方框擋兒，使敵人見了，矮子肚裏雖然疙疸多，也識不準葫蘆裏究竟賣甚麽藥，方框擋兒裏，究竟賣的是甚麽關子。</p>
<p>一　月　日，　　旅，攻克　地，殺敵　千，獲　無算，現正向　地進發，預計　日可逹　地，　日可直搗　　。）大家莫着急，這是未來派記者賣關子哪。</p>
<h3>從航空運動說到美國的故事</h3>
<p>— 耘殮</p>
<p>可以效法</p>
<p>偌大的一個馳名國際的通商口岸　上海，經過了將近匝月的全市總動員，經過了許過了將近匝月的全市總走呼號鼓吹宣傳的航空救國運動：據報紙的記載，只募到區區吐十餘萬元，其中還有天廚味精廠主人獨捐的十萬元；這是很明白告訴敵人，全國户口最多的一個上海市，號稱站在時代最前線的優秀民衆，愛國的情緒，不過如此這船！　　有一位姓李的朋友，當歐洲大戰時，他正僑居紐約城，美國旣不是同盟國，又不是協約國；他們只感覺戰爭的慘劇！以酷愛和平人類互助的本能，便在一日間，召集了一個全市各公團的聨席會議，商量組織救護隊一類的戰地工作，即席就問道：譬如傷病院一部分，你們共需經費多少？你們能夠自籌若干？結果綜計要募五百萬金，歷時三日，由聨會産生的委員，把全城一年份所有商肆各個的盈餘，調查的清清楚楚，又把盈餘規定爲五十分之十，來捐助這次的經費；支配妥當了，由聨會發出通知，於某日中午十二時，有本會會員，持表叩寳號辦公室門窗，請貴執事便把應納的捐欵，交給來人；於是不旋踵這驚人巨額的捐欵，就宣告綽有餘裕了。</p>
<p>李君同居的一位老年商人，他是中産富豪者，會裏因爲他經商盈餘，於另一公共事業，已出過捐欵，照例不必再納；老商人詫異聨會未派人取欵，認爲是失面子，親自到聨會去提出質問說：難道我這般年紀不配稱國民麽？不配愛國麽？經會中人詳細解釋，老商人纔悻悻回寓。</p>
<p>這故事是紐約城的實事，並非齊東野語！同胞們，我們的社會有這樣健全嗎？我們應該效法麽？還是繼續着空城航空救國麽？</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>

<p>第二回　陋室結芳鄰暗欽健叟權家擇良伴痛詆貧娃</p>
<p>趙翁笑着連連的拱了幾下手道：這可不敢當。這可不敢當！江氏笑道：這自然是句笑話，我們眞敢這樣子高攀嗎？依我的愚見：你們連長早點兒成家，這事就好辦了。家裏有個少奶奶，可比有個姑娘還好的多啦。趙翁道：您這話是說的對，我正爲了有這點意思，才肯讓自强把我接出來住。唉　不過說到娶兒媳婦的話，這事也很難。說時，摸了他的鬍子作個沉思的樣子。人家談到聘姑娘娶兒媳的時候，作姑娘的人，是没有法子插言的，因之桂枝手上只捧了一把瓜子，在一邊咀嚼着，並不發言。江氏就問道：聽說老太爺是保府人，是在城裏呢？是在鄕下呢？趙翁道：我們還有地種莊稼啦。全家都住在鄕下。江氏道：大槪府上人不少吧？趙翁道：我老哥兒三，只剩我一個了。晚一輩倒不少，可是都分家的了。江氏道：家裏有多少田地呢？趙翁道：夠吃喝的罷了，有一頃地。說到這裏，江氏好端端的向桂枝道：你聽，人家家裏有一頃地呢。又回頭向趙翁道：像您府上這樣人少，有三四十畝地，也就凑付着好過日子了。有一頃地，那是足夠的了。桂枝把手上一把瓜子都吃完了，將茶几上放的一杯茶，也端起來喝着。喝完了茶躇躊了一會，放下杯子。向他母親道：咱們回去把那件衣服趕起來罷。過了十二點没有得，那人家又要來催了。江氏見伊羽眉深鎖着，也許是自己姑娘不願意這件事，這就只好站起來向趙翁告辭，笑道；又來打攪您一陣，我們那屋子又黑又髒，也不敢請老太爺過去坐，老太爺動用的東西，短着什麽，只管到找那裏去拿，大家都是好街坊，好鄰居。趙翁笑道：我爺兒倆就是直統子脾氣，您不瞧我說話，我不會客氣的。江氏連聲道是，很高興的回去了。（一九）</p>
<h3>讀報雜感</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>請學漢卜式的救國</p>
<p>照例每天讀報，從大標題的下面，探得一點關於北方戰爭的新聞。也許自家還不曾遺失國家觀念，對於吾軍大捷的報告，是用了怎樣興奮的心情去細細地咀嚼。這時候，我簡直在心裏笑了起來，（好傢伙，一柄大刀舞動向敵陣，短短的日本小子影一樣的跌倒，夠痛快，難道他們的軍隊就這樣没有用！）我想。於是拉開嘴吧。對人一邊做手勢，形容怎樣殺敵，一邊朗聲贊嘆宋哲元孫殿英等部下將士的神勇。於是我摸出銀圓，馬上送到義軍後援會去。以盡我個人匹夫的責任，同時也得表示欽仰的意思。　雖然以後能不能（死守長城），現在無法來預言。</p>
<p>如果說我拿出了錢，其目的在於購買他們底光榮之死，我不是十足的資本家，還没有想到這一層。但藏有這種思想的，以我看起來，也未必必没有。例如湯玉麟放棄承德的消息傳佈之後，有若干愛國之士，本來想拿一點錢出來的，這時就不肯輸財救國了。（熱河已失掉了還捐什麽錢？給軍閥去存外國銀行嗎！）他們一致這樣呌。顯然，他們所以捐錢，是要把戰勝的事實的爲代價的。一旦失望，便以爲大事已去，再不要用錢。連國也不必救。但他們未曾想到以後眼前還有抵抗暴日的將士，還有不少繼上前線去的民族英雄。因憤懣湯　麟的棄職失土而便不想輸財的富翁，是想錯了的。縱然日本兵打進了關的，而且政府也依然空口說（長期抵抗），事實上毫無舉動；我們還是應該救國，有力的用力，有才的用才，有錢的用錢。　這意思連我也知道帶一點國家主義的色彩，而又近乎淺薄古老的說數，但在目前的中國，以民衆力量自謀得救的道路，還是學漢武帝時代的卜式爲是。至於前線的軍旅已在用刀殺敵，乃是力的表現：同時也是才的表現。安居在後方的我們，難道應該袖手旁觀，可以救國嗎</p>

<h3>公照垣軼事</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>威震東瀛的翁照垣將軍，舉國婦孺，都能道其死守吳淞月餘的功勞，就是憑吊過戰蹟的，徘徊到砲台灣蕰藻浜一帶，也没不同聲驚嘆翁將軍在簡直無可防禦中防禦，無可制勝中制勝；然而翁將軍曾有一段事在，多爲世人所忽視！</p>
<p>事實是這樣的：一天，我給　團工作，忽而在一包舊紙堆中翻出一包民國十九年八月十六日的東西，打開來將要換以新的申報紙，無意一年，却發見三號字的標題：一留法航空生邊險獲全：）我驀地一想，在近來我國飛行同志練習期中已累次見到失事的新聞；就是外藉機師也曾有過降落殞身的事實。同時仍無意地瞧兩行小標題：（由五百米突下墜僅輕傷，法報舉爲勇敢之中國人。）瞧後心情陡的緊張；這兩條標題好像符咒似地吸住我，於是仔細看下去：</p>
<p>（巴黎通訊：我國學生翁照垣（卽翁輝騰）去年由日本陸軍士官學校畢業後，卽赴法入莫關飛行學校，已由第二期畢業。日昨飛行至五百米突時，因摩打突生故障，致機身下墜，撞斷高度電流電線三根，全機跌碎。當卽由陸軍救護車將翁送人凡爾賽醫院。幸傷勢尚輕，不日卽可出院。此次飛機由五百米突下墜，復撞斷高度電流電線，而不致被焚，亦一異事。法航空部嘗派人研究其不起火之原因。法報則競竸謂其不死爲天幸。並譽爲勇敢之中國人云。）</p>
<p>（哦！一百五十六旅翁旅長竟然有過這麽一回兒軼事！）我看後從心底裏泛出這麽一句來；並且得了三個感想：</p>
<p>一　翁將軍大前年乘飛機由五百米突下墜，復撞斷高度電流電線而不致被焚，固應異事；併且彷彿是天公故意簸弄他，留待一二八小試鋒鋩的；但從一二八翁將軍履險蹈危，我軍未竟全功看來，也可見（天將降大任於斯人也，必先苦其心志；餓其體膚，行拂亂其所爲；所以動心忍性，增益其所不能；）孟夫子的話是一點不錯的！而窮小子們更應該堅决的硬着頭皮努力，嘗試！</p>
<p>二　法報競謂翁將軍不死爲天幸，並譽爲勇敢之中國人；然則中國人固有勇者，固可爲勇者；古人說：（天助自助，）吾中國人啊！快快起！快快起！快快勇敢起！加入戰團，視行軍如兒戲；視飛機大砲如晴蜓飛舞，螳螂揮臂；視敵軍如毒蜂，如壞蛋，如害羣之馬英勇地加以剪滅，搗毁，與懲創，替人類永除此　賊！現在加入飛行界的健兒，正應如翁將軍一樣，凌雲翶翔，不怕險阻，鍛鍊飛行的技術，發揚大無畏的精神。</p>
<p>三　翁將軍最近於陽日（七日）在北平通電就一百十七師師長，文中有感奮語：</p>
<p>（裹死馬革早懷伏波之心，</p>
<p>埋骨沙塲久蓄定遠之志。）</p>
<p>行見（整飭戎行，激勵十氣，軀彼豺虎，還我河山。）負弩前驅，端在翁氏。然而尤其切望有實力的武裝同志，戳力同心，團結起來，槍桿向外，盪滅妖氛，推去陰霾；重光那長白山，黑龍江，恢復我華華世界。</p>

<p>但外國人辦的（字林西釋）就揭載了二月十五日的（北京通信），詳述胡適博士曾經親自看過幾個監獄，（根親愛的）告訴這位記者，說（據他的愼重請查，實在不能得最輕微的證據，　　　　　　　他們很容易和犯人談話，有一次胡適博十還能夠用英國話和他們會談。監獄的情形，他（胡適博士丨丨幹注）說，是不能滿意的，但是，雖然他們很自由的（哦，很处布的！丨幹注）訴說待遇的惡劣侮辱，然而開於嚴刑拷打，他們却連一點兒暗示也没有。）</p>
<p>我雖然没有隨從這回的（愼重調查）的光榮，但在十年以前，是參觀過北京的模範監獄的。雖是模範監獄，而訪問犯人，談話却很不（自由），中隔一窗，彼此相距約三尺，旁邊站一獄卒，時間有限制，談話不准用暗號，更何况外國話。</p>
<p>而這回胡適博士却（能夠用英國話和他們會談，）眞是特别之極了。莫非中國的監獄竟已經改良到這地步，（自由）到這地步：還是獄卒給（英國話）嚇倒了，以爲胡適博士是李頓爵士的同鄕，很有來歷的緣故呢？</p>
<p>幸而我這回看見了（招商局三大案）上的胡適博士的題辭！</p>
<p>（公開檢舉，是打倒黑暗政治的唯一武器，光明所到，黑暗自消。）（原無新式標點，這是我僭加的　幹注。）</p>
<p>我於是大澈大悟。監獄裏是不准用外國話和犯人會談的，但胡適博士一到，就開了特例，因爲他能夠（公開檢舉），他能够和外國人（很親愛的）談話，他就是（光明），所以（光明）所到，（黑暗）就（自銷）了。他於是向外國人（公開檢舉）了民權保障同盟，（黑暗）倒在這一面。　但不知這位（光明）回府以後，監獄裏可從此也永遠允許别人用（英國話）和犯人會談否？</p>
<p>如果不准，那就是（光明一去，黑暗又來）了也。</p>
<p>而這位（光明）又因爲大舉和庚欵委員會的事務忙，不能常到（黑暗）裏面去，在第二次（愼重調查）監獄之前，犯人們恐怕未必有（很自由的）再說（英國話）的幸福了罷。嗚呼，光明只跟着（光明）走，監獄裏的光明世界眞是暫時得很！</p>
<p>但是，這是怨不了誰的，他們千不該萬不該是自己犯了（法）。（好人）就决不至於犯（法）。倘有不信，看這（光明）！</p>
<h3>巴比塞來華</h3>
<p>— 鄭伯奇</p>
<p>當熱河失守，平津危急，帝國主義加緊了瓜分中國陰謀的現在，（反帝）作家巴比塞，受了（反帝同盟）的委托，要和其他委員們一路來到中國，實地調查日帝國主義侵略中國的眞相，這是中國的著作家，乃至愛好文學的人們，應該注意的一件事。</p>
<p>自（九一八）事變以來，日本毫無阻碍地擴大戰事，美國的旁觀，國聨的調停，英法的捉摸不定的態度，這一聨的事實，完全暴露了帝國主義對華的聨合戰線。勤勞大衆早已感覺到帝國主義和中國民族獨立運動的絶對對立。在暴日的砲火聲中，掀起了東亞大陸的反帝運動的巨響。</p>
<p>帝國主義國際，爲維持他們的威信。爲實現瓜分中國的陰謀，曾由國際聨盟派遣李頓等七個軍人和政治家來華調查。這國際調查團的報告，并不主張日本撤兵，而只赤裸裡地把瓜分中國的計劃和步驟，描畫出來。除過胡適一類的高等華人以外，誰都表示堅决反對。但是帝國主義的列强并不因此而稍和緩其瓜分中國的計劃。現在熱河失守，平津告急，而東交民巷的太上皇、又在暗中活躍。全國的民衆正在憂慮，焦急，憤激的當兒，而巴比塞等要來華了！</p>
<p>巴比塞及其同行一團來華的任務，也正如李頓等國聨調查團一樣，調查（九一八）事變以來日本帝國主義的種種暴行。但是，他們的立塲却完全兩樣。他們是反對帝國主義的，他們决不會爲暴日隱蔽。他們是反對帝國主義的，他們决不會提倡瓜分或共管的毒計，不，更進一步，他們也和我們一樣堅决地反對瓜分共管。他們是反對帝國主義的，他們一定贊助我們反帝的高潮。</p>
<p>這樣看來，巴比塞及其同行的一團，完全是我們的友人。我們不應該表示歡迎嗎？</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>英語Ｈｕｍｏｕｒ譯爲幽默，始自林語堂，今　　此二字聨爲一詞，已爲　士所共曉，猶Ｕｔｏｐｉａ之般復譯爲烏託邦，Ｍｏｄｅｒｎ之田漢譯爲摩登也。林先生頃編論語半月刊，以幽默相號召。李青崖先生以爲幽默不如改譯語妙爲能兼顧音義二者。陳望道先生則欲以油腔滑調之油滑二字譯之，言者正色，聞者失笑。或謂俄文相當於幽默之一字，譯音爲狗不咬，直欲令人噴飯矣。窮見近日所謂幽默文章，類皆以微嘲暗諷爲能事，正如易寅村先生之所謂特别優駡者，頗欲以優駡易幽默。徒以幽默一語流行無礙，荀子所謂約定俗成謂之宜，故尚未公然向陳李林三先生提出優駡一爲商度也。病中翻讀甲寅週刊孤桐雜記，孤桐先生頗不以幽默一語被人誤解爲然。略謂幽默二字似從英語Ｈｕｍｏ　譯來，意指善爲俊語者之風趣也，而字面微得其反，易生歧解。文字之情懷固恒於字裏行間得之，所謂盡在不言中是也。然不言者言中之不言，非不言中之不言，自始無言，焉來語默恰到好處之辨。唐人喜作歇後語，以爲有趣，然非前固無以見後，一語不發，虚實隱見之妙，又何從知之也。嘗論音譯最爲保障名詞良法，然若以漢文字意參人，使音義兩面部顧得到，偶一不愼，恐將與冰麒麟等詞同一醜惡。雖幽默二字弊不至此，頻頻誤用，卽大不佳，以酉靺二字易之何如？孤桐此論發於八年前，當時鮮人注意。今則幽默二字已成新人口頭常語、電影廣告與化妝品廣告，亦欲借重幽默二字，引人注意矣。</p>
<h3>（小白臉）及其（文化）</h3>
<p>— 幸之</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>一說到（小白臉），無論何人便立刻　　　可以意識到一個（面如傳粉，唇若施脂，轉盼多情，語言若笑，天然一段風情，全在眉稍，平生萬種情思，悉堆眼角）的俏哥兒。賈實玉是小白臉，唐伯虎也是小白臉，古往今來，小白臉眞多得如數不清的恒河沙。</p>
<p>賈寳玉曾說過：（男人是泥做的）。惟其是泥做的，所以一見（水做的女人（便融化成爲一塌糊塗。賈大少這裏所說的　（男人），當然是僅指如他自己一樣的（小白臉）而言。這就是說小白臉的最高權威者是（女人），甚至小白臉的生命意志一切，無不是（女人）。以女人爲生命的動力，以女人爲生活的泉源，於是凡可以討好女人的，無不樂意爲之。這樣，所以我們的賈大少便會舚女人們臉上的胭脂，會陪着林妹妹哭，會多悉多病，會傷春悲秋，會發痴，而且也會做詩塡詞，行令賭酒，········。因爲（佳人）愛（才子），曠古如斯，所以小白臉又大多數都是（才子），賈寳玉唐伯虎便正是兩個實例。</p>
<p>現在，小白臉自然還是從前那樣（面如傳粉，唇若施脂）的小白臉，不過時代究竟是前進了，小白臉當然也前進了，前進了此什麽？丨丨打麻將，麻將，跳却司登舞，唱妹妹我愛你，塡解放詞，偶然塡不出，便偷古人一闋兩闋，（還要强嘴說是和原韻）而且會吹牛，會拍馬，會造謡。更有一點進步處，即是古時的小白臉如賈寳玉之流大都鄙視功名，而今日的小白臉則會由吹牛拍馬而弄得什麽部什麽會的乾缺，坐領乾薪。</p>
<p>總之（小白臉）是泥做的，最多愁善感的，是弱不禁風的，是只會喝酒打麻將做肉麻的詩詞，寫情書幾束以及什麽隨筆之類的，他没有意志，没有生命，没有活力，甚至於没有骨頭，站不住，坐不穩，只會依儇在（枕上），纒綿在愁中，國家事（管他娘），一切的事都（管他娘），雖然有時也發發牢騷，但終於只不過是（牢騷）而已。這便是（小白臉），丨丨一個幽靈，一具活屍。　　（二）</p>
<p>那麽，什麽是（小白臉文化）呢？</p>
<p>那便是璇宮艶史，是妹妹我愛你，是却司登舞，是情，愛，痴，愁，涙，酒，是大腿，櫻唇，是春天的落花，是秋天的紅葉，是寂寞，凄凉，苦悶，牢騷，是我的愛，我的心，我的寳貝，是幽靈的慘呌，是無病的呻吟，是垂死的秋虫的啾喞，總之，是幻滅，是没落，是現實的逃避。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>一個幽靈，一具活屍，這時代要他幹嗎？没落罷，你（没落階級）的呻吟！没落罷，你没落階級的文化！</p>
<p>編者附言：最近有幾位先生鑒於新　　　文壇陰　蔽空，狐鬼晝行，自告　　　奮勇，對於兩三鼠竊，爲文加以　　　訓斥。本刊爲維護文壇，肅清文　　　妖起見，對於此等（有功世道人　　　心）之批評文字，自亦樂予發表　　　。連日接到各方來函贊許，足微　　　（公理自在人心）。惟本刊篇幅有　　　限，且尚有更重大之工作正待着　　　手，此類批評，擬自即日起，暫　　　時宣告結束。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張貫平</p>
<p>（我是你們的同鄕，姓林的。）</p>
<p>海泉的話還没說完，房門打開了。他看見曹夫人穿着一件　了色的深藍色的人字羽棉旗袍，比那天在敎會裏看見時，更難觀了。但是臉上還是一樣滿塗着白粉，她只有那兩列貝齒非常的動人。她揭開了她的衣襟，露出了一個乳嘴來，在喂奶給她的小孩子吃。海泉看見她的乳房，也白晳得有幾分動人。</p>
<p>（啊呀，林先生麽？對不住了，我當是那一個。哈，哈，哈，請進來坐。</p>
<p>看見曹夫人那樣大方的態度，海泉反感着一種壓力，不知要怎樣地和她應酬才好了。</p>
<p>（老曹呢？）</p>
<p>（出去了，一刻就回來的。坐吧。請等一刻，就回來的。）</p>
<p>海泉只好跟着她走進來。看見他們房廟面是一張床，一張小書卓，一張小圓桌，兩把木椅，四張圓木凳丨丨凳面畫有粗俗的黑漆蘭花的。這些傢私和桌上的陳設，都是凌亂無章的。由此，不難看出他倆夫妻的日常生活來。海泉在一把椅子上坐下來後，還聞着一股尿臭。他才看見在床上的一角，堆着一大堆的拉濕了尿的水布，又髒又黑。</p>
<p>曹夫人放下了手中的小孩兒，仍然露着乳嘴，斟了一杯像黄牛尿般的微混的茶，笑吟吟地送到海泉手中來。他總覺得她的笑是不甚大方的。</p>
<p>海泉痴想了一忽，無意中發見了在前面的門角上，有一架很漂亮的乳母車。</p>
<p>（滿漂亮的車子，不便宜吧！</p>
<p>他笑着問。</p>
<p>（也不見得怎樣好，總之我們買不起就是了。那是老哈送的禮物，當小孩子滿月的時候）。　（這倒難爲老哈了。）</p>
<p>（算得什麽！在他們美國人，幾十塊還不是和我們幾個　片一樣。）</p>
<p>小孩子在床上哭起來了。</p>
<p>（眞討厭！一時一刻都要人抱着！眞是害得我一步脚也不能走動。我眞是要把你丢進黄浦江裏去，才甘心啊！）</p>
<p>曹夫人故意切着齒誇張地說。但還是走過去把小孩子抱起來了。她一點也不客氣地把她的乳房更加露了出來。</p>
<p>（老曹到那裏去了？又是到老哈那邊去了？）</p>
<p>（還不是！）</p>
<p>她此時無理由地向着海泉作了一陣不甚自然的媚笑。海泉看見，起了一陣小寒噤。他想，這到底是什麽意思呢。他覺得這間屋裏，實在和水晶宮裏一樣的冰冷，難怪小孩子的人中上，滿糊着灰白色的鼻涕。</p>
<p>（要這樣早就去麽？他不是說每天多是在下午去趟？）</p>
<p>（今天有點特别的事體。）</p>
<p>（什麽事體？）</p>

<h3>紗花　津帮套賣標紗</h3>

<h3>一平弱的標棉</h3>
<p>棉市微疲、但趨勢尚昂、因多頭吸進之額、堅不吐放、逢跌仍進加碼、因此市况較紗市爲擬多數人心理以本月份交貨籌碼缺乏、市面看高、但海外棉市仍疲較、紗市步落、廠方進意較滯、</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米絶少展進</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三四十號、零胃轉懈、包胃動辦僅千石、兼之來源續湧、市面未免現軟、蘇同青角南港等米、高貨仍定、次貨則跌三五分不等、杜洋尖及陰變元僅現見疲、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮到船三十餘號、市上日白粳價宜者稍有走化、市形又疲近尺、薄粳到少銷平、市形平正、早稻到旺銷呆、價小近角、洋杜埠尖到貨續有、零胃尚可、價疲數分、客尖平正、陰元到雖不旺、零胃乏交、談價小二三角、白元稍帶疲勢、</p>
<h3>客秈銷化停頓</h3>
<p>昨日客秈市况、到頭雖少、而去化更呆、存底略有、市面形勢與售價均有趨落之象、閩帮連日暢辦後、前日已有停辦之表示、昨日辦胃更少、形居停頓、統市只有成交蕪湖機元一百八十八包、價九元三角半、湖南砶靖二百七十八包、價六元五角半、本街祗去湖南機紅米二百包、價八元五角半、其他各米進户喊小一角、貨主不肯輕脫、統市未有成交、市面則已疲軟云、</p>
<h3>本月粉轉賣回跌</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤、各月份大致呈盤旋平疲之象、以洋麥報價、美坎兩處又小一二角左右、人心自趨不穩、近遠各期之業外浮多、各盤均有脫手、浮空則亦抵進、故交易略暢、市趨平定、迨至下午開盤、本月份之客帮多頭、逐有回出、以廠家之籌碼甚豐、竟難支撑、故最低開至一兩七錢六分、遠期各月份、大廠未出、小廠略有抛出、市氣又續疲滯、目下買氣之沉寂、實因國難日重、銀根緊縮、故此後如供多於求、恐市面長此疲落無神矣、結果本月份較前日小五厘、四五月份小二厘半、六月份小五厘、七八月份小二厘半、</p>
<h3>標準邊餅不振的主因</h3>
<p>連電報小····交易呆滯</p>
<p>昨日豆餅市面、上午開盤後、光邊有邊兩種標準、均趨小面、因大連來電報小、該帮行家、在市抛售、致各期市勢、頓見挫落、光邊四月期較前日跌二分、有邊五月期跌一分半、六月下期跌一分七釐半、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、又見沉寂、祇六月下期做開、較上午又短二釐半云、</p>

<h3>南北貨　糯米枝高貨叫漲</h3>
<p>元扁枝市均堅挺</p>
<p>金山枝因近日到貨寥寥、兼之號存日見單薄且有一部份堅守不卸、市勢復趨緊秀、據地頭函訊、今庚花苗形情僅有四分收成之　、故市象更爲堅挺、昨聞號方開盤上莊元枝爲二十七兩半、以　爲二十五兩至二十二兩、扁枝高貨三十四而二錢次至二十九兩、糯米枝貨底最缺、現市　破碎之好貨號盤要一百兩方　開兌云、</p>
<h3>五金　六分路皮現貨奇缺</h3>
<p>六分路皮（打包鐵皮）近來市上現貨十分鮮少意、所以市風益盛、趨况更秀、海外定貨、遥遥無期、緣是行情方面、恐尚要再漲、</p>

<h3>召集太平洋會議</h3>
<p>解决中日問題</p>
<p>政友會議員蘆田之主張</p>
<p>（哈瓦斯三月東京通信）主持日本時報之蘆田博士、係一老外交家、在政友會爲有力份子、最近帝國議會開會時、蘆田曾提出質問、指責日本外交不應仰承軍人鼻息、此案提出之時、日内瓦人士、紛紛議論、其後日本國内亦復如是、</p>
<p>蘆田氏頃在日本時報中發表一文、就渠本人意見、指陳日本新政策應有之基礎、</p>
<p>蘆田博士謂日本因與日内瓦失和、决定置世界各國於不顧、而採取完全獨立政策、殊不知國際間經濟文化地理上種種事物、互相關聨、此種關係一日不改則任何國家即不能閉關自守、與世隔絶、若必欲爲之、是自返於德川時代、而將辛苦得來之大國地位、完全喪失矣、</p>
<p>此外日本對滿洲旣定之政策、亦不能多所放棄、日本在滿洲之特殊權利、必須予以承認一層、在目下並無問題、因此種權利、在歐戰以前、早經列强承認、英前外相吉爾宋勛爵、曾通知日本政府、謂英國承認日本在遠東之優越地位、一九一七年美國國務卿藍辛、亦對日本大使石井子爵、聲明美國承認日本在滿洲有特殊利益、（編者按藍辛石井協定已與英日同盟先後取銷、以上云云現已不能成立、）以故目下問題、並不在此、</p>
<p>總之日本與國聨會所抱之目的、同爲（遠東和平之維持、）所不同者、惟逹此目的之方法耳、日本以爲滿洲脫離中國、成一獨立國家、實爲維持遠東和平斷不可少之條件、而國聨會則爲相反之主張、國聨會所爭者、在於形式、而日本則着重實際、</p>
<p>顧日本與國聨會所以衝突者、其原因不全在滿洲問題、日本外交笨拙、未能隨機應變、實爲其最大原因、</p>
<p>目下情形不能任其長久如是、此種局面、必須打破、欲逹此目的、須以下列數點爲基礎、改革日本政策、</p>
<p>一、日本應努力使各國暫緩三四年、再作决定、經此時期之後、滿洲旣可發逹、而（滿洲國）亦可安定、</p>
<p>二、三四年以後、中國與（滿洲國）關係、當可改良、而目下種種困難、亦即自然消滅、</p>
<p>三、日本雖决定維護（滿洲國）、但無侵略中國領土及西伯利亞之野心、日本對於此層、宜與中國及蘇聨妥協、以保障（滿洲國）之邊境、</p>
<p>四、中國時局混亂、對於中日國交、及遠東和平、實成爲長久之危險、此層李頓報告書已承認之、日本宜以至誠、出而合作、俾中國中央政府、得以鞏固、其與共産黨及盜匪奮鬬、日本亦當以同一心理援助之、</p>
<p>五、日本與美國之誤會、務求一次洗刷凈盡、此種誤會之起原、大半由於美國輿論、誤以日本對中國、甚至對西伯利亞、有侵略領土之野心、當設法消釋之、</p>
<p>蘆田氏主張召集與太平洋有關係各國、在東京開會、以便根據上述方針、確定日本新政策、</p>
<p>此項會議之議程、大致如下、</p>
<p>一、由國際合作、以鞏固中國中央政府、</p>
<p>二、由太平洋沿岸各國、簽訂仲裁及友好條約、包括蘇俄·中國·（滿洲國一·日本及美國在内、</p>
<p>三、討論日本所提之海軍軍縮計畫、　蘆田氏以爲最大困難、在使中國參加此項會議、此層當由日本外交當局、努力爲之、</p>
<h3>五年計劃中蘇聨之國防（續）</h3>
<p>红軍以前也没有坦克車、在内戰期間、所獲自白衛軍與干涉者之數十輛坦克車、事實上不能算作坦克車軍器、但在一九二九年前、就是這幾十輛坦克車、尚是用以訓練紅軍的唯一標本、在檢閱紅軍時、我人輒將這幾十輛坦克車陳出、外人見之、常常私自竊笑、然坦克車在現代作戰中之意義、至爲重大、全線佈機關槍、非利用坦克車、不能衝破、現在各國軍隊十分注意坦克車者、其故亦在此、同時、各國軍隊竭力於研究坦克車技術與戰略上之諸作用者、亦莫非此理由、</p>
<p>尤困難者、一九二八年前、不論汽車工業或曳引機製造業、蘇聨完全没有可以自造坦克車之技術人才、更不用說、所以、我人首先不得不去仿造外國坦克車式樣、努力結果、我人已可製造新式坦克車不惟可以自造、且建立了製造坦克車的基礎、訓練了熟練工匠、現在蘇聨自造之坦克車、並不遜於外國所造者、現在我人亦可毫不誇大的說、第一次五年計劃四年間、在製造和軍用上、業已完全學會了新式坦克車武器、</p>
<p>關於空軍、略說一說、蘇聨空軍、在一九二八年前、即已不弱、第一次五年計劃前及開始時、均已逹到巨大進步、惟在飛機質量方面、如飛行高度、載量等、均趕不上世界航空技術、在第一次五年計劃四年内、蘇聨飛機製造業、確大有進步、蘇聨發明數種新式航空馬逹、已在大量製造、航空人材、亦訓練不少、我人相信、在第二次五年計劃期間、蘇聨定能趕上世界航空技術水平、且甚至超過之、</p>
<p>至於海軍、五年計劃自然没有輕視、四年之間、所有艦隊、均加修理、其中若干並澈底革新、潛水艇隊、亦曾加强、沿海國防、也大加鞏固、海軍人員、大爲增加、其學識與海術、均較前提高、而造船業之展開、更不用說、</p>
<p>所有這些紅軍武備技術改造之工作、不惟對我輩軍人、非屬易事、而且國家所費、亦不在小、我人此地所言者、尚就用於紅軍武備技術之支出而言、其用於創辦軍用工業基礎之支出、尚未算在内、在一九二七　二八年、用於技術之欵項、本已不少、而在五年計劃期間、爲實行軍備改造、所費自然更鉅、然而正因此在技術上却得以澈底改造紅軍、使紅軍不惟在革命精神上、組織上、與軍紀上、大加鞏固、而在蘇維埃軍事技術上、（空軍軍與坦克車這類複雜軍事技術均在内）亦無比的鞏固了、</p>
<p>最後、關於紅軍幹部、再略爲言之、軍事技術之刷新、自然需要大量技術人員、工程師、以及有商業軍事知識之官佐、軍官之訓綀機關、爲陸軍大學、一九二八年時、所有陸軍大學學生共爲三千一百九十八名、一九三二年、各陸軍大學專門化、學生數目更形增加、並採取種種方法、加强軍事敎練人才之培植、在近數年内、這一方面之成績、將可充分表現出來、</p>
<p>但軍事技術之革新、不惟需要高級軍官、且需要中下級官佐、在五年計劃期中、全蘇聨軍事學校、均大加改革、新設軍事專門學校如航空、坦克。輜重等。亦爲數不少、</p>
<p>在第一次五年計劃當中、軍隊本身所改變者、爲連排長之重新調動、此爲適應紅軍技術之改造者也、如步兵官佐額數、略爲減少、騎兵亦然、反之、砲兵隊、坦克車隊、以及其他工兵、官佐均大增加、</p>
<p>軍官社社成份、亦大改善、一九二八年時、工人出身者爲百分之二八、一九三二年已增至百分之四十、軍官中黨員數目、亦大增加、一九二八年曾爲百分之五十五、一九三二年已增至百分之六一、尤其高級及重要軍事人員中、黨員數目增加更多、比如砲兵軍官中同期曾由百分之一五增至百分之八一、步兵中曾由百分之五四增至百分之八八、鐵甲車中竟全體爲黨員、</p>
<p>紅軍中共産青年團員（黨的後備軍）之數目、增加尤速、一九二八年時、全體紅軍兵士中黨員及青年團員共爲百分之三一又六、現在已增至百分之五九又點四、紅軍兵士、軍官及政治工作人員之一般文化程度、也大大提高、軍隊中並設有作戰訓練班及各種演講組、以陶養軍官及兵士之軍事與政治生活、（譯自一九三三年一月二十四日伊士威期吉亞報）</p>
<h3>田軍克復巴中</h3>
<p>匪向清江渡方面潰走</p>
<p>城内只見血痕與遺屍</p>
<p>四川通信、巴中赤匪、迭經國軍田頌堯部猛攻、屢遭挫折、仍負固自守、三月九日有匪衆一營來西山投誠、力言赤匪内部動摇、子彈缺乏、嗣據探報、亦謂匪軍以國軍三面圍剿、進退兩難、應付技窮、又兼糧食將盡、意欲拼命作最后之掙扎、如不得逞、决即他遁、田部之曾羅兩師得訊後、當於十日拂曉、簡派精銳由貓鼻探砲台埡分頭進擊、又先令薛團由兩河口渡河向望王山威脅、宋培根團以一部固守原線、親率一部向巴城之匪猛攻、官兵因相持日久、心理異常憤發、故皆奮不顧身、所向無敵、匪亦極爲頑强、拼命應戰、短兵肉搏、甚爲激烈、卒於午前九時擊退匪部、完全佔領巴城、赤匪紛向尖山坪清江渡四林橋方面退却、國軍亦步步跟追、俘殺甚衆、宋團隨將望王山佔領、朱團將插旗山塔子山佔領、肅清巴城附近一帶之匪、曾師當派李煒如指揮該部及廖旅由三河口石廟渡河、進佔榛子埡、曾團佔領大樑山擂鼓寨、協同兜剿殘匪、國軍入巴中城後、刦餘民衆、皆欣喜鼓舞、鵠立道旁歡迎、詢及赤匪蹂躏狀况、咸稱糧食已爲匪搜索淨盡、縣内留居人民、不被赤匪署殺、即受赤匪虐待、種種苦狀、慘不忍聞、至於房屋、半被破毁、市面亦蕭條萬分、所映於眼簾者、惟牆壁間之赤匪標語、街頭巷角之斑斑血痕、及城下田間之纍纍遺屍而已、（三月十二日）</p>

<h3>今日東北開凍通航</h3>
<p>巨額糧食運去</p>
<p>麥粉二百萬袋</p>
<p>白米四五萬包</p>
<p>東北營口安東、自去冬封凍以來、停航逹三個多月、至今日開始解凍、而滬上商輪、亦於本日起復航營口、但在此解凍開輪之始、滬市突有大批米糧麵粉等、運赴僞國之舉、此事不特關係民食、抑且有背禁令、本報記者、特赴各方調查、詳情如下、</p>
<h3>定購大批粉米</h3>
<p>在此日軍動員攻熱之時、前方需要糧食至巨、據聞日軍係食白米、僞滿軍則食麵粉、故近來東北方面來滬採辦大宗麵粉、至二百萬袋以上、而以綠兵船牌居多數、又密購白米四五萬包、其運往地點、分爲兩處、營口未開凍前、裝赴大連、今營口已開凍、則直接從上海載至該埠起卸、滬上華商英商各輪競裝者、有海昌·毓大·泰豐·大通·肇興·政記·以及太古等各輪公司、</p>
<h3>今日開始通航</h3>
<p>營口來電、該處港口解凍、已定本月二十五日、上海輪船、即從今天起、開始裝貨往營、大通公司之通順輪、今日運去白米二千四百包、麵粉十萬四千包、太古浙江輪、亦載麵粉十餘萬袋、泰豐之鳳翔、亦於本日開營、按江海關早已禁止糧食運往東北、而交部亦訓令各輪局勿裝糧食至僞國之安營連各埠、但一般船車、均置若罔聞團爲競載、未知海關方面、如何處理也、</p>
<h3>强迫船員登記</h3>
<p>僞國在去冬營口安東封河時、曾下僞令、凡中國商輪開到僞國海口、在進口時、除照納稅鈔等外、又增加華輪行駛營口安東者、須由僞關騐船、出給騐過證書、方可開行、又令進口各華輪至營口者、須向僞國舉行船員登記、每人納繳登記費二元五元不等、其辦法一如我國之定章、此次開往、即須强迫實行、</p>
<h3>検查嚴厲狀况</h3>
<p>大連方面、已禁止上海華字報紙輸入、如有夾帶前往、一經搜出、便須重罰、上海赴大連或營口安東中國人、須舉行特别搜檢、除行李物件、一一卸騐外、甚至身上衣服貼邊裏子、及頭上帽子裏子、統須當塲用小刀剖開、由日探檢視、並對陽光照觀、如稍有不符、即認爲間諜、便須捉捕而去、生命便難保定也、</p>

<h3>信用</h3>
<p>— 濟</p>
<p>昨日本報載；瑞典兒童數人，醵資向意大利某廠匯購手拉風琴，杳無消息，乃聨名上書憲相墨索里尼，墨氏不但照寄貨件，而且親筆附信，說明該廠破産，并向諸孩道歉，吾人生此（掮着牛頭不認賊），（說白話不會臉紅）的世界，居然會聽到亘古未有，曠世罕聞的奇事，眞是驚而且佩了，爲之咋舌縮不進！</p>
<p>匯欵買物，（杳無消息）的勾當，在我素稱（禮義之邦，信用爲本）之貴國，却不算什麽十分（了不起的罕事，）不值得大驚小怪。但是，以一威勢足以震撼世界的怪物，丨丨法西斯蒂的威權者墨索里尼，竟知道由己國一工廠破産信用，顧及到國家自己的地位底體面及信用，肯向外國的幾個頑皮小孩親筆道歉眞呌人駭聞，恐還有人不信他確有其事，你看我們的交際花對於求婚書的覆信，還要雇書記先生來代筆，何况是日理萬幾的黨國巨頭，那裏有閒工夫閒心來顧及（說甚麽有關體面信用）的交易事？根本我們的小朋友，就萬萬不敢斗膽去試動一下太歲頭上的土：也許可以的，那除非先預備下一筆（大拉斯），然後又上書購買（兒童號的飛機。一這樣一來，然也只有博得報上（原函照登）的答覆的希望而已！</p>

<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>商店缺貨的防範</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個營業員？（俗稱櫃員）每月的薪金是十八塊。人家，在正薪之外？或許有佣金？升工，賞錢等等的外快：然而我們呢？不要說外快？連正薪要拿到全數，已經是不容易了！何以呢？請假（無論婚，喪，疾病，）要扣薪；開錯了發票要吃賠賬；這些到還不要去管牠，因爲請假，總算没有來做事情，發票開錯，總是自己的疏忽。最最冤枉的，要算缺少了存貨，也要吃賠賬了！</p>
<p>先生，你知道嗎？原來我們同事，祗要是營業員，都要管存貨的。在種類多的部份，每人要管到百種以上，祇要你一缺，那就非如數賠償不可。其理由是要防我們舞弊，盜竊。然而我們要舞弊吧？賣去的貨物，由練習生拿結包紮員，包紮員騐明無誤，方始可以包。所開的發票，也有稽核員稽核過，存貨每夜要點清入賬，，明天有會計員來核對；每月底，又有稽核員來大點一次，所以根本無從舞弊起。要盜竊吧？跑進商場，任何私人東西，都不能帶進去，就是有，也須寄存於同人寄物處，拿出去的時候，又要經事務員稽查過，那未，縱有通天本領，也無從盜竊吧？</p>
<p>缺貨的原因，不外二種。一是賊伯伯的光顧，他們趁我們在忙亂顧不到的時光，施展出三只手的伎倆，不告而取。二是廠裏來貨錯誤，或包内短少。然而經理先生說：（做營業員的，應當要眼觀四處，耳聽八方；給賊伯伯偷去，是我們在四處八方中間有一方没有顧到，没有顧到，就是能力薄弱，能力薄弱者，不要說吃賠賬，連飯也要不結他吃。廠裏來貨錯誤與短少，是自己手續上的錯誤。爲什麽不是拆開包來一件一件的點過？所以這種錯誤，是惰性的表現，有惰性的人，更加不應該留他。先生呀丨在一個人招待到七八個頋客以上的當兒，一方面要招待週到，一方面要顧到四處八方，而不使賊伯伯施展技倆，事實上無論如何是辦不到的吧？包内貨物，要件件點過，也是事實上所不能夠的。你想任何一種貨品，廠裏來起來，起碼要三五百打，（因爲批發貨物也在門市部發，所以來時須大批）假使每打都要拆開來稽點，如非一天完全不做别的事情，否則那裏能夠呢？可憐呀丨同事們爲了缺貨，有時要吃二三十元賠賬，白做了一個月還要倒貼些。然而經理先生的官話，在飯碗壓迫之下，誰也不敢道不字。有之，亦惟有在先生面前低訴，不知先生肯爲我們丨苦櫃員丨呐喊一下嗎？此請</p>
<p>撰安　　　櫃員邱純忠上</p>
<p>編者按：上面是邱君的原信，我們一字也没有修改過：照這封信的文筆看來，他至少是一個中學畢業生。而且還是一個數一數二的畢業生呢！他現在做了櫃員，整天價忙個不了，每月的代價，只有十八塊好洋鈿。這未免太菲薄了些。至於這爿商店的管理方法，有的當然很好，但是有的地方，未免太刻苛了。請假要扣薪，這原則是對的：但是因爲婚喪疾病而請假，也是一般的要扣薪，實在覺得說不過去。開差發票要吃賠賬，更是毫無疑義的。不過店裏用着稽核員，這責任似乎稽核員至少也要負担一半：至於稽核出來的差誤，那末可以向顧客算轉，無須賠貼。即使要加以相當儆戒，不妨逐日記載起來，作爲考成的根據。至於商店裏缺少貨物，誠然是一件嚴重的問題；經理先生認眞辦理，誰能說他不是。不過要櫃員負起全責，在生意清淡，人手衆多的店家，當然可以。像邱君執業的那爿商店，就爲難了。我們知道，强人所難，是辦不到的。像這種場合，似乎每一部份，有添設若干人員，專門來管理這件事情的必要了。</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（九續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>（所以，除非你今天吃了朝友的一頓飯，明天便請還他，否則打後天起，你和他就没有什麽交情可講了！）在伍逸笑得回不過氣來的當兒，趙千里又斷續發表着他的人木三分的冷話。（譬如我們吃報館飯的人，因爲地位的關係，人家時常有利用你的必要，於是張三，李四，便一齊擁過來跟你做朋友了，今天請吃飯，明天請看戲，眞像孝子順孫一般的趨奉着你，可是一旦你離開了報館，我敢極武斷的說，就是碰巧你和他們在餐館裏偶然撞在一起，他們發誓也决不會替你會鈔的了！）</p>
<p>這一晩，伍逸便開始結識了一個年歲比他長許多，經騐也比他長許多的畏友。</p>
<p>（啊玉麟！）第二天清早，伍逸因爲隔夜聽了趙千里的一番極玄妙的高論，心裏非常痛快，便興冲冲地趕到王玉麟的律師事務所裏去找他。兩個老同學在久别重逢之下，忙坐在一張大沙發上，各自極眞誠地告訴出過去的情形來：結果，伍逸很安慰地知道他底老同學這番特地寫信找他，確是爲着要叙舊誼，而不是要他發表什麽宣傳消息。</p>
<p>（在上海，没有一個女人倒是很寂寞的！）在過去的兩年裏，王玉麟在實質上是得到了一個法學士的頭銜，在精神上却飽嘗了失戀底痛苦。這件事的經過，他也完全告訴了伍逸；接着，便宣佈出他今後的方針來，（但是有幾個好朋友常在一起玩玩，也是一件很大的興趣！我最近結識了一個朋友，很特别的一個，丨一個退伍的戲子！哈哈！老伍！你别瞧不起他！他倒也有一副很完全的藝術頭腦，跟别個戲子是絶對不同的！現在，他想開一爿唱片公司，打算邀幾個人合股，我已經是答應他了。老伍！你不妨也加入幾份，閒的時候，同去坐坐，却也不輸如弄一個俱樂部：而且我告訴你，他還能時常請幾個男戲子女戲子來唱唱，這可不寂寞啊！）</p>
<p>王玉麟始終是一個戲迷。他覺得跟人家合開唱片公司，眞是一件比什麽都有趣朱的事情，便竭力的慫恿伍逸一同加入；恰巧伍逸的環境，新近發生了一番絶大的轉變，心上正悉太寂寞，没處可以消遺，聽他這麽一說，也就允許了！</p>
<p>（不過，那一位朋友呌什麽名字啊？）最後，伍逸這樣問着。</p>
<p>（林大平！）</p>
<p>（啊！是他嗎？不是跟一個頂紅的女戲子，喚做什麽（麥娥）的　　　　伍逸正待利用他幾年來當報館編輯的經騐，給林大平發表一些簡短的小傳的時候，門上忽然有人輕輕叩着：王玉麟說了一聲Ｃｏｍｅ　ｉｎ，立刻就一個穿着狠考究的西裝，膚色狠白，鼻子狠大，身材狠矮小，神氣狠患厚的人，欵步而入。</p>

<h3>（城市之夜）的喊呐</h3>
<p>— 嘉炎</p>
<p>戲劇和電影的重要成份是（暗示）没有暗示，一張片子即使有良好的表演，也不過一朶朝開暮謝的藝術之花。有良好的表現，加以强有力的暗示的戲劇，才有永存性。城市之　夜，有深刻的暗示丨！平均地權。</p>
<p>城市的建築，是有義務而無權利者做成。城市的文明，是有權利而無義務者享樂。城市發逹以後，物價的飛漲，地産的抬高，把城市做成者丨！貧苦工人驅逐出境。而讓城市享樂者丨！紳士太太們丨！一切據爲己有。貧苦工人們，何嘗願意離開自已有血汗功勞的城市，怎奈（城市不易居）呢！那就是城市之夜的喊呐丨！</p>
<p>倘若有十幾處小房子别墅，公館，而每夜分身不下的老爺們，會想到貧無立錐的苦工。倘若穿百多元一件的來路羊毛背心，獺皮大衣，而打士汀爐傍邊打噴嚏的少爺們，，想到破棉被還在當舖廟未贖出來的窮骨頭。倘若天天赴宴而至不消化，生胃病，牙齒痛的闊佬，會想到餐粥餐飯的餓鬼。倘若姨太太多而至神筋衰的大漢，會想到餓死老婆的窮鬼，那就好了。貧富衝突可以和解了。共産的恐怖至少可以遲到五十年了。可惜有錢有勢的大人先生們没想到這一層！獨善其身的人太多了。兼善大衆的人太少了。他們爲己的精神太專注了。竟忘却改進社會，爲大衆謀幸福，爲人羣减輕痛苦，是每個有錢有勢的大人先生們的責任。而且只有他們才有這種力量丨！否則貧富不均，苦樂懸殊的現狀愈顯著，貧富的衝突愈猛烈，勢必趨向同歸於盡的途徑！</p>
<p>雖然城市中不少爲富兼仁的大慈善家，大活佛。可是總覺得杯水車薪，無濟於事。慈善事業，是要用科學方法才有普及的效果。在馬路上分錢給以叩頭爲職業的乞丐，反爲增加他們的依賴心。施粥施飯，救得一時救不得一世。最完善，最經濟，最永久的慈善事業，就是復興工廠。受日本的砲毁，和不景氣的打擊，工廠停了不少。工人失業的不得了。須知工廠一日不復開，不重建，富翁不過少賺一日錢。但是工人却少食一日飯。富翁們恐怕賺不到錢，便不敢開工廠。而願意倒貼利息存入外國銀行，或者經營地産，提高地價，加重貧民房租的負擔，實行（率土地而食人肉）的致富術！同一樣想賺錢，爲甚麽不肯做有益人羣的企業，而偏要做損人利已的治産呢？倘若富富翁們肯投資工廠，那麽不獨國内工業可以發逹，而且貧民可以有自食其力的機會，一家飽煖，自然没有爲非作列的事。那眞是修子修孫，功德無量的好事啊！</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>評（一剪梅）</h3>
<p>— 椀</p>
<p>（一剪梅）曾經在（中央）映過，今天又在西海放映，上座不多。</p>
<p>嚴格說起來，這張片子，荒謬的地方甚多。舉出來，讓大衆評題一下！</p>
<p>白樂德是一個脂粉將軍，卑鄙小人，胡倫廷旣然在學校裏頭都看不起他，怎麽會和他結交，况且初到人家，就窺人内宅，調戲人家的閨閫，這種下流行徑，胡倫廷是深曉得他的，怎樣臨走的時候，倒把妹妹託這種人照應呢？</p>
<p>二，胡麗珠入手就看不起白樂德，後來白樂德傾陷她胞兄的陰謀工又發覺了，到底麗珠還是和他結婚，大槪這也是呌做（孽緣）吧？</p>
<p>三，軍閥的小姐當衛隊長，這種胡調，未免太不近情。</p>
<p>此外可笑的地方還多，不能一一提出。倒是演員方面，却個個都很成就。除掉王次龍的擠眉弄眼，稍爲過火之外，阮玲玉的麗珠，自首至尾，無懈可擊。還有攝影方面，也算不差，幾幕美術風景，亦甚出色，因此下了這張片子的總評一句，就是（演員很好，導演太差）。</p>
<h3>評（體貼入微）</h3>
<p>— 梅邨</p>
<p>當我看外國片時，每每感到劇情不緊奏而看得莫明其妙，在這（體貼入微）裏，劇情很連貫，没有讀說明書，也能懂得内容，所以該片的導演在劇情分幕的安排上，已免掉不緊凑的弊病。</p>
<p>男主角吉姆士鄧飾少年律師皮爾，以主角地位言，僅能說平常稱職，没有驚人的表演，女主角蒲絲瑪洛蘭飾一淑女海倫，聽說還是第一次上鏡頭，態度閒雅，誠屬難得，對於愛護她姊姊遺下的兩個孩子，在湯曼驚夢呌喊一幕内，盡露慈愛之懷，却到好處，飾二個小孩的裴斯德菲爾士和喬琪安斯納均很好，一種天眞瀾漫的自然態度，極有精彩，可說能幕幕討人歡喜，也是全劇最生色之處。</p>
<p>當却利從窗口逃出而喊集千百孩童，圍住玻爾寓所一幕，穿插很妙，是全劇最緊張的地方，其他像大百貨商店的情形，簡單的分幕演出，適合需要，不覺什麽麻煩，也是滿意。</p>
<p>以劇情言，原是一部男女愛情片，而在父母愛子的表情上，也有深刻的描摹，所以不獨在男女愛情上可說（體貼入微），即在父母愛子和孩子愛他的父母上，也能見到（體貼入微），這片是該的劇名和劇情有兼顧吻合之妙呀。</p>
<h3>蕭伯納諷嘲好萊塢</h3>
<p>— 華明</p>
<p>愛爾蘭諷剌作家蕭伯納氏此次環遊世界過美國時，好萊塢影片藝術科學研究學院特預先以長途電話請蕭氏赴好萊塢攝一二短片，蕭氏當於電話中答稱（演講且曾聲明謝絶，何况攝片？）後雷電華派拉蒙及華納第一國家三公司聨名派代表與蕭氏面商，請蕭氏至少須攝一小段短片，蕭氏笑答曰：（蕭函納老矣，設或年少翩翩，則定來博一美男子之名，毋須諸君之請矣，）諸代表猶婉言懇函：片蕭氏又曰：）蕭函納酷愛金錢，恐至好萊塢後，雖驅之亦不肯離去。）云云，寥寥數語駡煞一般財奴矣。</p>
<p>數年以前，米同梅公司老闆塞茂高爾温氏，遊歐州，至英國時，曾請蕭伯納編一劇本，並聲明願出重金。蕭伯納答曰：一蕭伯納祇知金錢，不知有藝術，高爾温先生爲吾虚名所誤矣。）高爾温默然而退。</p>
<p>蕭伯納素不滿美國人所謂之（洋錢人）ＤｏｌｌａｒＭａｎ，尤痛恨好萊塢人物之恃財凌人，故其著作中戲劇雖多，未嘗貪金錢而將攝片權售於好萊塢云。</p>

<h3>The Position of President of the Executive Yuan: Wang and Song Are Still Declining</h3>
<p>Whether Wang Will Go to Baoding Is Undecided</p>
<p>Nanjing, Wang Jingwei underwent an examination for diabetes by his attending physician, Luo Guanghuo, on the morning of the 21st. The results showed an increase of over thirty degrees compared to when he was in Singapore, and his digestive power was also found to be weak. He immediately underwent purgative treatment. At 10:00 AM, he visited Chairman Lin again to discuss political affairs. He stated that due to his unrecovered health, he was unable to handle strenuous tasks and intended to request that Song be appointed as the substantive President of the Executive Yuan, while he would continue to serve in the Central Government, working together to deal with the national crisis. It is heard that the Central Government will discuss and decide on the 22nd whether to approve Wang's resignation as President of the Executive Yuan. As for the affairs of the Executive Yuan, Song instructed that since Wang had returned to Nanjing, he should seek Wang's instructions for handling them. Wang stated that since he had not yet resumed his duties, he should still seek Song's instructions. Therefore, the accumulated matters in the Executive Yuan must wait until next week before the Executive Yuan can convene a meeting to discuss everything. Wang Jingwei is scheduled to convene a meeting of the heads of various ministries at the official residence of the Ministry of Railways on the 22nd to discuss the policy towards Japan and his resignation as President of the Executive Yuan. (21st Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Chu Minyi said that President Wang has always been extremely responsible for national affairs and is unwilling to be perfunctory. This time, he returned to the country willing to do his best to serve in the Central Government. Therefore, he only lingered in Shanghai for one day, meeting with old friends, and then hurried back to Nanjing. He is currently unable to handle strenuous tasks due to his illness. Holding the posts of Central Executive Committee member and Standing Committee member of the Central Political Council and presiding over the central government is already a heavy burden. If he were to also hold the post of President of the Executive Yuan, his illness would inevitably worsen, and outsiders might suspect that it is a political illness. Therefore, Wang still hopes that Song will be officially appointed, while he can contribute his opinions at any time. Wang's illness had not fully recovered when he returned to the country. When he was in Singapore, the sugar content tested at just over one per thousand, but the test in Shanghai increased to one hundred and forty per thousand, which has worsened. He is still continuing treatment after coming to Nanjing. The doctor advised that he must have absolute rest from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM every day, and after blood tests, it is planned to carry out purgation within a few days to eliminate the accumulated depression in his abdomen. The date on which he will depart for Baoding to visit Chiang has not yet been determined. (21st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nanjing, Peng Xuepei told reporters on the morning of the 21st that Wang plans to go north to comfort the soldiers at the front within a few days. Wang and Chiang will meet in the near future, but it has not yet been decided whether Chiang will come south or Wang will go north. Wang has not fully recovered his health and cannot resume his duties. The issue of the President of the Executive Yuan will likely be resolved in one or two days.

<h3>Current Commentary</h3>
<p>A View on the Future of the War of Resistance</p>
<p>The recent battle at Xifengkou by the troops under Song Zheyuan dealt the Japanese invaders a very significant blow. When the news of the victory arrived, the whole country rejoiced. The arrogant and powerful enemy even admitted to suffering losses of this magnitude for the first time since the Meiji Restoration's military training. The heroic, tragic, and glorious victory of this battle is worthy to be juxtaposed with the January 28th Shanghai Resistance, shining brightly in our history books. This shows that our country today is not without soldiers who are capable of enduring hardship and are willing to sacrifice their lives to fulfill their duties, nor is it without armies that can fight. It is only because of the influence of the words "non-resistance" since the September 18th Incident of the previous year that loyal and righteous people have been reduced to sighing in despair, unable to serve the country even if they wish to die for it.</p>
<p>Although this great victory is enough to dampen the enemy's courage and refresh international perceptions, there are still many great difficulties ahead. The victory in this battle does not mean that the enemy's aggressive steps can be stopped. What concerns us is that the anti-Japanese troops may still be fighting independently without an overall plan. We are not military experts and therefore do not know how strategy should be used. However, from the perspective of ordinary people, after this great victory by Song's troops, and with the enemy's strength greatly diminished, it would seem to be a necessary strategy to take advantage of this momentum and launch a simultaneous counterattack from all sides. However, recent war reports indicate that while fierce fighting continues at Xifengkou, other areas such as Lengkou, Gubeikou, and Shihe have entered a state of ceasefire, as if Xifengkou were engaged in a solitary struggle. For a nation invaded by others, on the verge of extinction, to have one place resisting while others watch, is like a sick person unable to flexibly use their limbs, or like a rusty machine unable to smoothly turn its wheels. This kind of independent resistance will likely be defeated by the Japanese invaders one by one. The events of January 28th serve as a recent warning.</p>
<p>What will happen now? Mr. Wang Jingwei said in his report at the Central Commemorative Week that "At this point, there is nothing to say except resistance." Mr. Yu Youren also said in his report at the National Government Commemorative Week, "We will never seek temporary compromise with the enemy. We would rather be shattered as jade than preserved as tile." Since the Central Government has shown such clear and firm instructions, we have no doubts. However, in view of the bloody battle of January 28th last year, which began as a lone army's struggle, followed by retreat due to being unsupported, and ended with a ceasefire and negotiation, with Shanghai returning to its life of pleasure and indulgence, we are constantly worried about repeating the mistakes of January 28th. Today's war is more important than the January 28th war. If it is unfortunate that it remains the same, then Rehe will probably never be recovered, and North China will not be able to have a day of peace. How can the people of the country not think about this?</p>
<h3>Flying War Flags in the Sky</h3>
<p>Opening of the German Reichstag</p>
<p>Hindenburg's Address Expresses Hope for Loyal Support of the Government to Restore Past Glory</p>
<p>Hitler's Reply States That a Fractured Germany Meant Instability for the World</p>
<p>Berlin - President Hindenburg and Chancellor Hitler, along with key figures from the new government, traveled by car this morning to the Potsdam Garrison Church to attend a religious ceremony marking the opening of the new Reichstag. Flags were hung and arches erected along the streets, and throngs of spectators cheered as they passed, welcoming them as conquering heroes returning in triumph. The ceremony took place at noon, and the church was extremely crowded. The former Crown Prince was also in attendance, but members of the Socialist and Communist parties were conspicuously absent. President Hindenburg delivered a solemn address, stating that the government would address the current difficult problems with unwavering resolve, and therefore its responsibility was great and complex. He hoped that the new members of the Reichstag would provide loyal support to the government. He said that those present in the church today could recall the brave, patriotic, and indomitable spirit of the former Prussians who unified the German tribes. He hoped that everyone would be inspired to work for the resurrection of a unified, free, and honorable German nation. Chancellor Hitler, in his reply, stated that after a period of prosperity, Germany had experienced economic decline, financial chaos, and millions of unemployed. Thus, the nation of poets, writers, and thinkers, driven by suffering, embraced a yearning for the rebirth of a new nation and a new life. The reforms of 1918 had come to an end, and the Kaiser and the government had what they did not want but had to do to secure Germany's freedom through battle for a new life. Germany was one of the most important elements in the world and a fractured Germany would not mean the world would be richer or happier. One notable event during today's grand ceremony was President Hindenburg's giving a Fascist-style salute to the former Crown Prince. The church was hung with old war flags, and the President raised his field marshal's baton, signaling the start of the ceremony. After delivering his address, the President placed a wreath before the tomb of Frederick the Great, then re-entered the church to pay his respects to the former Crown Prince. Shortly thereafter, he exited the church. As he left, members of the National Socialist Party all rose and gave the President a Fascist salute. The one who felt most desolate and melancholy in the church was former Chancellor Dr. Brüning, who now appeared as an insignificant figure among the members of the Reichstag. The Reichstag is scheduled to begin its work in Berlin tonight. (21st dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Xi Government Demands Dictatorial Power</h3>
<p>Submits Memorandum to the National Assembly</p>
<p>Berlin - The memorandum from the National Socialist government to the National Assembly requesting dictatorial power has now been published. It requests that the National Assembly grant the current government dictatorial power during its term in office, or until March 31, 1937. This proposal would allow the government to enact laws that conflict with the constitution and to abolish the jurisdiction of the National Assembly and the Federal Council over this legislation and over foreign treaties. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Berlin - Because the new House of Representatives is meeting in the city of Potsdam, near Berlin, thousands of tourists have arrived by train, streetcar, and bus, making it the largest crowd since 1914. The streets of Potsdam are jammed with cars, making it almost impossible to pass. The flags of the old empire, the National Socialist Party flag, and the Prussian state flag are flying everywhere. At 9:00 a.m., several units of the Reichswehr (national defense army) lined up in front of the Jesus and Catholic churches and the military garrison church. Members of the National Socialist Party and the Steel Helmet League guarded all the main roads. In front of the church steps, where Hindenburg reviewed the troops, stood many officers wearing old imperial army uniforms and steel helmets adorned with medals. The police wore peaked helmets. The crowds on the streets wore small cloth flags, either with the swastika or with the black, white, and red imperial flag, which served as emblems of the Stormtroopers (SA) and the Steel Helmet League. At 9:45 a.m., the Reichswehr honor guard arrived in Potsdam, led by a military band and carrying military flags, and took their position next to the military garrison church. Because of the large crowds, the landlords of the houses facing the military garrison church rented out their balconies for viewing, with rental prices reaching 2,000 francs. The police maintained strict security, with police officers stationed on the rooftops. (21st Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>Key to European Stability</h3>
<h3>France Does Not Object to Joining the European Four-Power Pact</h3>
<p>British and French Prime Ministers Meet Again</p>
<p>Careful Consultation on Details of Agreement</p>
<p>London - According to the latest news from Paris today, the talks between the British and Italian Prime Ministers in Rome have indeed shown signs of improving the European situation. According to news from Paris, there is now a possibility of rapprochement between France and Italy. It is reported that French Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Flandin, after consulting with their cabinet members tonight, will inform their British counterparts at tomorrow's meeting that the French government is willing to support the British authorities' work in Rome. It is widely believed that the talks over the past few days will have a significant positive impact on diplomatic relations among European countries, and the repeated declarations of no recourse to arms will have a very pleasant psychological effect, helping to restore public confidence. According to informed sources, France is prepared to participate in a pact of a consultative nature, but France must have sufficient time to study the details. (20th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Paris - British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon arrived here this morning from Rome. Prime Minister Daladier and Foreign Minister Flandin welcomed them at the station, and the British delegation immediately traveled by car to the British Embassy. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British and French Prime Ministers</h3>
<p>Consult on Terms of Agreement</p>
<p>Paris - The main objective of the agreement drafted by the British and Italian authorities in Rome is to promote ten years of cooperation in Europe in the spirit of the non-aggression pact. This agreement could be extended to overseas colonies in the future. The agreement stipulates that the peace treaties will be revised in accordance with the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant. Britain, France, and Italy agree to recognize Germany's equal rights and allow Germany to reorganize its army to have the same status as other European countries. Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria will be given the same treatment. The agreement will last for ten years, and if no notice of termination is given one year in advance, it will continue for another ten years. British and French prime ministers and diplomatic officials met at the British Embassy this morning to discuss the terms of the Anglo-Italian agreement. Although the French government has neither acknowledged nor denied the aforementioned terms, semi-official sources believe that some terms still need to be revised and subjected to very careful study. The French media believes that this agreement could bring about major changes in Europe. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Reported by British Newspapers</h3>
<p>Outline of Draft Pact</p>
<p>Paris - The outline of Mussolini's new peace pact, as reported by the London Daily Telegraph, has today received semi-official confirmation here. It is said that the draft guarantees cooperation between Britain, Italy, France, and Germany to maintain peace in Europe. Other countries may also join, provided they formally ratify the new pact. However, after the ten-year term of the new pact, these joining countries will have no right to terminate or extend the pact. The four countries also recognize that Germany should have equal rights to armaments, and the time has come to implement this principle of equality. In order to ensure that the new pact is fully effective, France, Britain, and Italy must find ways to revise the various peace treaties. The League of Nations Covenant already contains such provisions, and the same will now be done for Austria and Bulgaria. In addition, it is reported that the draft also stipulates that the countries concerned will attempt to implement these provisions outside of Europe and in matters relating to colonial affairs. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Key to Success or Failure</h3>
<p>Hangs on Paris Talks</p>
<p>Rome - The acceptance by British Prime Minister MacDonald of Mussolini's plan is generally welcomed here, and is seen as a major victory for Mussolini. However, the pact of a consultative nature among the four powers is still in its embryonic stage, and success or failure depends on whether France agrees to cooperate with Britain and Italy to stabilize peace in Europe. The current obstacle to cooperation is the discord between France and Italy, which stems from the Italian belief that Italy did not receive what it deserved in the Great War, and from France's assistance to Yugoslavia and its refusal to grant Italy naval equality with France. As for the relationship between France and Germany, Italy is capable of persuading German Chancellor Hitler, and the British Prime Minister is capable of persuading France, so that is not a cause for concern. (21st Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Washington - British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon will be discussing the plan proposed by the Italian Prime Minister with French officials in Paris tomorrow. People here regard the Anglo-French talks as very important, because Italy has stated that Mussolini's plan is not limited to the four major powers, and British Prime Minister MacDonald is very concerned about the future attitude of Poland and the Little Entente countries. Therefore, it is generally believed that the key to the issue lies in the meeting in Paris. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>French Newspapers Fear</h3>
<p>Losing Their Leading Position</p>
<p>Paris - French newspapers are still engaged in criticizing the Italian Prime Minister's plan, saying that while the Franco-British talks are important, it is difficult to achieve results with this plan. They also stated that France does not want to abandon Italy's suggestions, but the Rome conference and today's talks between the British and French authorities here will be a prelude to lengthy negotiations. As for France's views, the semi-official Temps summarized them by saying that a new idea has entered the situation at the end of this week, but no one knows to what extent it will develop. (21st National Telegram)</p>
<p>Paris - The French media maintains a lukewarm attitude towards the four-power peace pact recently proposed by Mussolini, and unanimously rejects it as untimely. French newspapers have put forward two major reasons, saying that the establishment of a peace treaty between the four major powers would be a great loss to the various small countries, and that France would lose its significant influence in European politics. Le Matin claims that if France joins the four-power pact, the various small countries will cease their enthusiasm for supporting France, which would be tantamount to actually reducing France's military strength. Therefore, since France has reduced its military strength and been deprived of the support of its allies, it will henceforth be subject to the will of its powerful neighbors and will have to make concessions again and again. (21st National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Public Opinion</h3>
<p>Sympathetic to the Italian Prime Minister's Plan</p>
<p>Berlin - It is not known here what the real significance is of the plan proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, so German public opinion is reserving judgment. However, it is said that the plan for cooperation among the four powers did not begin today. Berlin has advocated it before, but no one agreed to it. However, the Italian Prime Minister's plan includes the revision of certain provisions of the peace treaty and the implementation of the principle of equality in armaments. German public opinion expresses considerable sympathy for the Italian Prime Minister on this point. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>The American Side</h3>
<p>Concerned About the Situation in Europe</p>
<p>Washington - The plan proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has attracted great attention in political and journalistic circles. However, the State Department is maintaining silence. The State Department is well aware of the difficulty of bringing French and German views closer together. The Italian Prime Minister's plan may be seen as capable of restoring peace in Europe. President Roosevelt believes that the recovery of American industry and commerce depends on the success of the disarmament conference and the world economic conference. Even partial success would be beneficial. Therefore, Roosevelt is extremely concerned about the situation in Europe. The American disarmament representative, Davis, will probably meet with French Foreign Minister Flandin. (20th Havas dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Little Entente Countries</h3>
<p>Deeply Fear Being Sidelined</p>
<p>Capital of Yugoslavia - Political figures here are quite worried that the four-power committee plan proposed by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will sideline the Balkan Little Entente countries (i.e., Yugoslavia, Romania, and Czechoslovakia), and they believe that this policy may bankrupt the various organs of the League of Nations.

At 2:00 p.m., they captured Nanjiang City. The bandits fled in droves to Dazhai and Xiaozhai. They are currently continuing the pursuit. Before leaving, the bandits dragged away all men and women under the age of 40 and massacred more than 1,000 civilians, which was extremely brutal. (20th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Negotiations Regarding Water Pipes in the Capital City</h3>
<p>Nanjing: During Wei Daoming's tenure, water pipes for the capital were ordered from the French company Paris Factory. Contracts were signed for delivery and payment, stipulating deadlines.

The original specified thickness of the manufactured water pipes was 45 millimeters, but upon delivery, they were only 13 millimeters, resulting in bursts. Shi Ying has repeatedly negotiated with the Paris Factory, insisting on compensation for the burst water pipes and guarantees that the French company will bear all losses for any bursts within two years. The French company has sent personnel to Nanjing to negotiate. Our side must achieve the goals of compensation and guarantees; otherwise, the water pipe bursts will be announced to the world.

<h3>U.S. Congress to</h3>
<p>Discuss Silver Issue Next Month</p>
<p>No Additional Taxes on Silver for Commercial Use</p>
<p>Washington Dispatch, 20th of the Republic: Senator Pittman stated today after accompanying Congressional Democratic leaders to a meeting at the White House, "The issues of reminting silver coins and stabilizing silver prices will be considered after Congress concludes the current emergency session." It is understood that the silver issue was discussed at length during this White House meeting. This meeting took place after the U.S. Bureau of Mines released world silver production statistics, which indicated a total of 11,674,000 ounces in January, the highest record since November 1931, due to a surge in production from Mexican silver mines. President Timothy immediately summoned Senate leaders to discuss this matter. It is reported that Pittman presented detailed opinions, requesting the government to purchase silver in the world market to sufficiently increase silver prices, and stated that silver subsidiary coins should be reminted to allow the U.S. to increase trade with South America and China. None of the attendees expressed the President's attitude. However, judging from Pittman's statement, it is evident that Roosevelt will at least be willing to</p>
<p>Allow the silver issue to be debated in Congress. Currently, there are four proposals regarding the silver issue: one, Senator Dill's proposal to purchase silver and issue new banknotes; two, Senator Wheeler's proposal to remint silver coins at a ratio of sixteen to one; three, Senator Pittman's proposal to purchase silver; and four, an amendment to the Glass-Steagall Banking Act to reduce the pure gold content in gold dollars. All four proposals were explained in detail to the President today. The Congressional session is expected to open around the end of April.</p>
<p>Reuters Washington Dispatch, 20th: U.S. Treasury Secretary Woodin stated on March 16th that silver used in commercial exchanges would not be subject to restrictions, but restrictions would be imposed on those attempting to hoard it. It has been learned that Woodin's statement refers to the regulations issued under the authority granted to the Secretary by President Roosevelt's declarations of March 5th and March 9th. It is reported that legitimate silver transactions will not be restricted, but if depositors withdraw large amounts of cash with the intention of storing them abroad, such withdrawals will be prohibited upon confirmation.</p>
<h3>Former Commander-in-Chief of British Navy in China Dies</h3>

<h3>Japan Resolves to Sever Ties with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Withdrawal Procedures Document Divided into Four Sections</p>
<p>Statement and Accompanying Documents More Important</p>
<p>Still Dreaming of Cooperation Between China, Japan, and Manchukuo</p>
<p>Formal Notification Delayed Again and Again</p>
<p>Habe Issues Statement to Reassure the Public</p>
<p>China League Agency Tokyo Correspondence: Japan's consultation on withdrawing from the League of Nations is still under consideration by the Privy Council. The procedures are scheduled to be submitted on the 27th, divided into (Notification of Withdrawal from the League of Nations), (Statement), (Accompanying Documents), and reference materials, totaling over 2,000 pages. Among them, the statement and accompanying documents are more important as they outline Japan's policies. An abridged translation is as follows:</p>
<h3>Key Points of the Statement</h3>
<p>1.  Restate the process of withdrawing from the League, praising cooperation during its membership, and then state the purpose of withdrawing from the League, which is to carry out Japan's Far Eastern policy. 2. Although Japan is withdrawing from the League of Nations, it will continue to uphold international peace and cooperate with all countries in the world, working to promote world peace and enhance human happiness. 3. In the future, Japan will participate in disarmament conferences convened by the League of Nations or peaceful endeavors aimed at economic or cultural facilities as a non-League member, providing effective and appropriate cooperation. 4. Regarding maintaining peace in the Far East, Japan is determined to assume its responsibility, but is willing to cooperate with countries with interests in China. 5. With the belief of recognizing its independence, provide benevolent assistance to (Manchukuo) and support it to the end. 6. The policy towards China is to quickly restore proper friendly relations, expecting China to become a completely independent country as soon as possible. Therefore, providing assistance for internal affairs and the necessary friendly assistance. During this period, make China recognize (Manchukuo) independence as an accomplished fact, hoping that the relationship between China, Japan, and Manchukuo can be resolved peacefully.</p>
<p>The matters described in the accompanying documents are related to the follow-up measures after withdrawing from the League of Nations. Excerpts of its content are as follows: First, after withdrawing from the League, Japan still has the right to participate in the General Assembly and Administrative Council of the League for the next two years in terms of law. Since the actual participants are few, the Japanese government has decided not to participate in the meeting. Second, the expenses to be borne by the Japanese government after withdrawing from the League of Nations will be calculated on a daily basis and paid off, fulfilling its obligations. Third, Japanese staff serving in the League of Nations do not have to</p>
<h3>Accompanying Documents</h3>
<p>Retreat together with the government. For those who voluntarily resign, the government will find ways to arrange or assist them. Fourth, the following measures are prescribed for the handling of various League of Nations agencies after withdrawal: 1. Deal with China, Russia, and European and American countries with covert tactics, avoiding causing trouble and creating incidents, thereby removing the anxiety of China and foreign countries. 2. Continue to cooperate with various specialized agencies affiliated with the League of Nations, showing Japan's impartiality. If it is beneficial to Japan, the League of Nations General Assembly and Administrative Council have political colors, so they will not participate. Other peaceful undertakings, administrative contacts, etc. should still continue to cooperate. However, if there are any agencies that are detrimental to Japan, cooperation will be canceled at any time. 3. Continue to cooperate with various agencies established under treaties, such as the Mandates Commission, the International Office of Public Health, the International Air Navigation Commission, the International Hydrographic Bureau, the Straits Commission, the General Transport Council, and the Central Opium Board. 4. The International Economic and Financial Conference is closely related to Japan. Participation is beneficial. After Japan withdraws from the League, Ambassador Ochiai and Finance Officer Tsushima will still participate in the meeting. 5. The articles of the International Labor Organization are inserted in the 13th part of the Treaty of Peace with Germany and are somewhat different in nature from the League of Nations. The International League has many political colors, while the International Labor Organization is still a social and humanitarian organization, and has a very large autonomy over the League of Nations. Not only should it not be cut off, but it should cooperate with this organization, and cooperation is considered a wise way to ensure peace. When Brazil and Spain left the League of Nations, they also declared cooperation with the International Labor Organization, which was caused by recognizing the special nature of this organization.</p>
<p>China League Tokyo Electric Dispatch, 20th: Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations has been delayed again and again. It was said on the 24th that it was too late, and it was said that the procedures would be submitted on the 27th. The Japanese people deeply believe that the Japanese government cannot quickly decide because it is secretly expecting Britain and France to serve as mediators. However, Britain and France are still as quiet as Mount Tai, with no intention of intervening. News of this has generated various rumors within the country, and people's hearts are shaking. From anxiety to pessimism, and then to self-abandonment, the Japanese Navy is very worried that it will not fall to the outside but to the inside. Today, a statement was issued in the form of a conversation with a senior official to reassure the public. Its words are: (The world will never blockade Japan because Japan withdrew from the League of Nations. If Japan is really blocked, the navy will immediately blockade Chinese ports, cutting off all countries' trade with China. Japan will use strong trade to maintain its economy during times of crisis, and the losers will be Britain, France, the United States, Italy, and other countries. The countries are too busy to take care of themselves and will never dare to cause a second world war with a blockade policy. Therefore, there is no economic blockade, and there is no world war. The Japanese Navy has insufficient power to attack the world, but it has more than enough power to retreat and defend Asian territories. If the League of Nations or the United States interfere with the South Pacific Islands, we will deal with them with strength. Please do not worry too much), etc.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Will Enter a New Stage</p>
<p>The General Committee Will Reopen Tomorrow</p>
<p>British Plan to Be Discussed</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva Dispatch, 20th: The British government still wants the disarmament conference to start a general discussion of the British disarmament plan starting from Thursday. Foreign Minister Simon will arrive here soon. It is generally believed that Simon will ask the General Committee to discuss the British proposal in a special procedure. The British delegation does not want the British proposal to be scattered in the hands of multiple committees, so it will firmly request that the General Committee be solely responsible for item-by-item discussions. The British delegation also wants the governments of various countries to express their opinions on each item within a short period of time. The British are eager for the disarmament conference to express itself quickly, and its psychology is easy to understand. However, it is doubtful whether the governments of various countries can satisfy Britain's wishes less than a week after the British plan was proposed. Most delegations have not only not sought the opinions of their respective national defense agencies, but also the representatives have not studied the issues raised by the British plan in detail from a political point of view. In this situation, it would be too hasty to ask them to express their opinions on the British proposal immediately. Therefore, the meeting of the General Committee on Thursday will still not exceed the scope of general discussion. Major countries will definitely want to judge the British plan in its entirety, especially the secondary countries that have not expressed their opinions at the meeting on Friday. However, governments will never want to express definite views before soliciting the necessary opinions. But in any case, the disarmament conference will enter a new active stage after Thursday.</p>
<h3>U.S. Representative Davis</h3>
<p>Departs for Europe Tomorrow</p>
<p>National Electric Dispatch, Washington, 20th: Today, the U.S. State Department announced that Disarmament Representative Ambassador Davis will depart for Geneva on Thursday, stopping briefly in London to discuss new developments in disarmament with British authorities. According to Tai's original plan, it was planned to depart earlier, but Mussolini suddenly proposed a four-nation European pact, so he had to postpone it for a few days to discuss the matter with Secretary of State Stimson. Although Davis does not participate in the negotiations on the European Peace Pact, if such a pact is realized, it will have an impact on the U.S. disarmament proposal. It is also heard that the U.S. government will authorize Davis to informally discuss the war debt issue in Europe. However, it is not known whether Tai will carry any substantial disarmament proposals from the new government on this trip. It is only known that Roosevelt advocates unified reductions, but has not announced any other plans besides his statements during the election campaign. Today, news was also received here from Rome that Mussolini's proposal stipulates that the new Peace Pact will be valid for ten years, and if no signatory country declares it invalid after the expiration, it will be automatically extended for ten years.</p>
<h3>On New Disarmament Plan</h3>
<p>Japan Opposes the Following Points</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo Dispatch, 21st: Japan does not approve of the British Prime Minister's disarmament plan. Japan requests that Japan's suggestions be discussed together. The naval community said that although Britain's security suggestions are thorough, there is no reason for Japan to abide by the London Naval Treaty, which is limited to 1936. Therefore, Japan opposes extending the treaty beyond 1936. Japan requests that the tonnage allocated to it by the Washington Treaty and the London Treaty be revised. Japan also opposes limiting the number of military aircraft in each country to 500 before the issues of aircraft carrier sky bombing and land and naval forces are resolved.</p>
<h3>Parliament to Close Soon</h3>
<p>Prospects for the Japanese Political Situation</p>
<p>Dongbao Painfully Discusses Parliamentary Politics</p>
<p>Saying It Will Not Realize It Is Heading Towards Its Own Grave</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo Dispatch, 20th: There is much speculation in the political world about whether Prime Minister Saito and Finance Minister Takahashi will resign due to old age and frailty after the parliament adjourns on March 24th. Some predict that the government will soon return to the path of party politics. However, according to sources responsible, there will be no changes in the current cabinet, and even if there are changes, the national character of the cabinet will be strengthened.</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo Dispatch, 21st: If the parliament does not extend the meeting period, it will officially close on March 26th.</p>
<p>The World Society translated the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun and said: (omitted above) The impression given to us by this parliament is just like the lost soul and soul of a sleepwalker. Why is the parliament in such a state? The fact that the parliament has been forgotten by the world, I am afraid that there is nothing more than today. Since the opening of this parliament, its state of incompetence can be said to be exposed to the bone. Has parliamentary politics lost its charm? Today, the political parties are verbally advocating the defense of parliamentary politics, but they are not making any efforts to achieve it in action. If this is the case, there is no other way for parliamentary politics to go except for natural disintegration. What we want to ask is, can Japan's politics still expect future stability? The world's decline has driven all countries into the walls of nationalism, and the tendency of economic and political self-sufficiency and exclusionism is becoming more and more obvious. As a result, it induces the politics of a country to a dictatorial form. The dictatorship of Hitler in Germany and the dictatorship of Mussolini in Italy are not to be mentioned. Now, even the free country of the United States is giving the President unprecedented absolute power in the name of saving the situation. From the perspective of the world's trends, the decline of parliamentary politics is an undeniable fact. However, is it necessary for Japan today to follow this trend? We believe that there is absolutely no need for it, and we also hope that there is no need for it. However, today's government parties in our country often take the opportunity to sing the praises of the defense of the constitutional system, but judging by their actions, they are just enough to lead to the opposite result, because they have all abandoned a sincere and straightforward attitude and have no sincerity towards politics. If you want to give an example, you can see from the fact that the government parties have absolutely no attitude of reflection on this huge and amazing budget. Under today's circumstances, if the parliamentary authorities still only know how to bury their heads in political actions below the secondary meaning of the transfer of power, the departure of the people's hearts will be inevitable, even if it is said that the diggers of the constitutional tomb are the political parties themselves.</p>
<h3>Japan and the Netherlands</h3>
<p>Negotiate Arbitration Treaty</p>
<p>Reuters Tokyo Dispatch, 21st: It is now known that negotiations between Japan and the Netherlands on an arbitration treaty are underway. According to Dutch Foreign Minister Becklen and Japanese Ambassador Saito, they discussed this issue some time ago. The treaty stipulates that any disputes between Japan and the Netherlands regarding legal issues or treaty interpretations that cannot be resolved through normal diplomatic means should be handled by the Permanent Court of Arbitration in The Hague, and not submitted to the Permanent Court of International Justice of the League of Nations.</p>
<h3>German East Asia Society</h3>
<p>Holds 60th Anniversary Commemoration</p>
<p>Japan News Agency Tokyo Dispatch, 21st: The German East Asia Society held its 60th anniversary commemorative meeting here at 3 pm today. Prince Fushimi, German President's representative Badohausen, Honorary President Vice-Lieutenant General, Japanese Foreign Minister's representative Tōgō, Director of the European and American Affairs Bureau, Yamamoto Teijirō, Minister of Education proxy, and 300 Japanese and German celebrities attended.

Badohausen read the German President's congratulatory message and then published a major paper on the history of Japanese-German culture. The meeting adjourned around 5 o'clock.</p>
<h3>The Birth of the New Fascist Cabinet in Germany (Continued)</h3>
<p>(German Correspondence) Huang Gongan</p>
<h3>The Direction of Political Affairs of the New Schleicher Cabinet</h3>
<p>(I) Repeated Dissolutions of Parliament</p>
<p>After Schleicher was officially appointed as Chancellor on the 30th, he convened the first cabinet meeting on the 31st and decided on the new direction of his political affairs. The so-called realization of the "Third Reich" policy was thus produced. Subsequently, at Schleicher's proposal, stating that the parliament could not form an absolute majority faction for the government, he requested President Hindenburg, based on Article 25 of the constitution, to repeatedly order dissolutions and restructure the parliament. This proposal was passed unconditionally. Thereupon, on February 1st, Hindenburg, based on the provisions of Article 25 of the constitution, repeatedly ordered the dissolution of the parliament, which is the representative of parliamentary democracy, by issuing so-called emergency decrees. This was another unfortunate blow. At the same time, it also indicated the decline of modern German parliamentarianism. However, Schleicher's extreme and radical political means are evident here.</p>
<h3>(II) Implementation of Two Four-Year Plans</h3>
<p>After the current Schleicher cabinet came to power, in addition to repeatedly ordering the dissolution of parliament and making active and drastic changes in politics, the implementation of the so-called two four-year plans is most noteworthy. The first four-year plan aims to completely liberate German farmers from their suffering. The second four-year plan is dedicated to tackling the German unemployment problem. By combining these eight years, it should be possible to restore Germany's pre-war (i.e., 1914) social and economic prosperity and its free and equal international status.</p>
<h3>(III) Consolidating the Hindenburg Front</h3>
<p>Consolidating the Hindenburg Front is also the new slogan of the current new cabinet. The meaning of this new slogan is generally understood to be that Germany is currently in a state of disarray, riddled with holes, and struggling under the chaotic political situation of partisan infighting. Like a group of dragons without a head, lacking a political figure as a common center of trust, this gloomy phenomenon will indeed lead Germany to some unknown misfortune. Schleicher himself used to advocate personal dictatorship, but now, due to the circumstances of the nation, he has had to abandon his prejudices and form a cabinet with Papen and others. Schleicher now believes that it is especially necessary for the whole country to unite in confidence and form the Hindenburg Front, with everyone under the leadership and banner of Hindenburg, in order to avoid division and unnecessary party strife and to save the country from its crisis.</p>
<h3>(IV) Implementing a National Labor Service Obligation System</h3>
<p>Since Germany's defeat in World War I in 1918, it has been restricted by the Treaty of Versailles from implementing a compulsory militarist system (i.e., all young people in the country who reach the age of eighteen must join the national army as conscripts for two years). In recent years, Germany has creatively implemented a so-called national labor service obligation system. Unemployed young people in Germany, especially unemployed university students, can freely join national social construction labor groups (such as groups for opening and building national highways, new canals, mining, and building houses). They work, enjoying the state's provision of food, clothing, and shelter, without monetary compensation. They work four hours a day and receive four hours of military physical training, completely forming a barrack-like military service life. However, in name, it is beautifully called a national labor service obligation system, in order to avoid interference from the Allied powers. (This so-called national labor service obligation system was first implemented in Hungary, then in Austria, and is now being implemented in Germany.) Its purpose is, on the one hand, to relieve unemployed workers, which is the so-called "work-for-relief" idea, and on the other hand, in addition to their work, each person must also receive four hours of military physical training. Once the country is in trouble, they can immediately become strong warriors to defend the country. This is truly a win-win situation and can be said to be a new creation in modern national policy. Especially in China's current society, it is extremely necessary to emulate this system in Germany and Austria in order to save the country from its current crisis and to promote the realization of social construction. I hereby add a few words, hoping that the people of the whole country will pay attention. Since Germany implemented this so-called "engineer-soldier system" the year before last, about 250,000 unemployed university students and other unemployed middle school youths across the country have freely joined the workforce. (I have a German classmate from university who is also a member of this team, and I often have face-to-face discussions about the experience of this life, which is extremely interesting. When I have time in the future, I will write another article to inform my countrymen.) Now, the new cabinet has specifically stated that it will make the greatest efforts to promote, encourage, protect, and maintain this national social labor service obligation system, so that it can achieve a better and more improved youth organization in the future and expand its numbers to 500,000 or 1 million people.</p>
<h3>(V) Strictly Preventing Leftward Leaning</h3>
<p>After the new cabinet was established, journalists from across Germany went to meet with the Minister of the Interior to inquire about his views on domestic policy. How the cabinet would deal with the left-leaning attitude was of particular interest to the journalists at that time. Minister of the Interior Dr. Frick expressed his determination to strictly prevent left-wing reactionaries in his reply to the journalists, which was very clear and resolute. Frick said that if the Communist Party does not heed the cabinet's warnings and stop its propaganda of provocation and central general strikes, the government will respond with the greatest strength and the most severe steps and methods. If the strength of the Berlin police is insufficient to fully resist the riots of left-leaning workers, in the future, members of the German Steel Helmet organization will be incorporated to assist the police in jointly protecting the security of Berlin. This plan will certainly deal a great blow and threat to left-wing activities.</p>
<h3>(VI) Changing the Parliamentary Election Law</h3>
<p>In order to obtain a majority of seats in the government in the future parliamentary elections, the new cabinet intends to change the parliamentary election law. German people residing in foreign countries will also have the right to vote in the future, and the number of people elected in other local areas will also be increased.</p>
<h3>Predictions on the Future of the New Cabinet</h3>
<p>Every time there is a change of cabinet in Germany, there are more pleasing and grand official statements of political programs. In recent years, since the invention and widespread use of the phonograph, there have also been so-called government phonograph speeches, new slogans, and emergency decrees. The former is the government's announcement of new political opinions, such as vowing to actively pursue the realization of a certain plan with the greatest determination and the greatest effort, or saying that the government has considerable confidence, etc. In short, they all say things that can give the people pleasant listening and exciting comfort. The latter is the cabinet's weapon to eliminate past bad deeds and potential forces, or other obstacles and political enemies. We in Germany have long been accustomed to these dual-track political means. In fact, although the political program sounds beautiful and the parliament has been dissolved, the new terms of the two four-year plans also shine brightly after the Russian five-year plan. In the end, whether various new attempts and new wishes can go smoothly and be safely realized and successful as Schleicher expects is a matter of great doubt, considering Germany's current internal and external environment. Just take the unemployment problem as an example. Schleicher wants to completely relieve the suffering of unemployment with a four-year plan, which I am afraid will not be easy to do. It must be known that the root of the economic panic is not only lurking in Germany itself, but is also seriously and greatly affected by the outside world. Even if Schleicher can use coercive economic policies to give some people job positions, the closure of foreign markets and the inability to distribute products abroad are beyond Schleicher's power. If products cannot be sold, factories will certainly be difficult to survive and maintain. Factory closures and the emergence of the unemployment problem are a natural result that is difficult to avoid. Whether overly ruthless means of preventing leftward leaning can prevent a large number of proletarians from making major resistance or can further intensify the struggle between the sharp left and right extremes, its future is difficult to make people optimistic. Once Schleicher's policy of preventing the left is misapplied, it will be able to help promote the growth of left-leaning forces. If so, it will cultivate Schleicher's future strong enemy and future trouble, which is by no means absolutely impossible. Let us take the previous Schleicher cabinet as an example. When he came to power, he did not seem to have everything under control, and his phonograph speeches to the people of the whole country were no less inferior to Schleicher's. Who would have thought that the unexpected would come and that everything would be beyond Schleicher's expectations? He was in power for less than eight weeks, only 54 days of short life. Once the cabinet was overthrown, where was the achievement? This is because there are often contradictions between the proposition and the environment. Moreover, the current economic panic in Germany has reached its peak. Six million unemployed workers are clamoring for food. Most of the production factories across the country have closed down completely. Credit often starts to shake. The war debt has not been fundamentally resolved. As soon as Schleicher came to power, the threat of a nationwide general strike was like a raging storm. The national finances are tight. The previous year's budget was not enough to be remedied. Tax revenues are also decreasing day by day. (In 1929, the national tax revenue was 600 million marks. In 1932, it was only</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>300 million marks.) In addition, Hugenberg has always advocated capitalism, with the protection of large landowners and capitalists as his duty, but Schleicher has the color of national socialism. Although his fascist party's political program in principle recognizes the economic autonomy of private property with free activities, in practice, the demands of the fascist party do not allow large capitalists to manipulate the forces of social economy, and it advocates confiscating the property of Jews and liquidating all serfdom. Finally, Hugenberg advocates that more cities should benefit industrial groups, while Schleicher advocates that more cities should benefit the middle class and farmers. As for Papen's policies, of course, he is unwilling to leave the gentry class. Speaking of these deformed phenomena of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, whether snakes and tigers can conspire together is very doubtful. In short, the difficulties faced by Schleicher's new cabinet, the mission entrusted to it by the country, and the urgency of the masses' desire for safety are more difficult and heavier than any previous cabinet. It can be said to be in a very serious era. Although Schleicher has extraordinary wrist strength, it is difficult to overcome this extraordinary difficulty. However, the big mystery that is not easy to solve is the repeated elections of the parliament on March 5. Schleicher believes that this parliamentary election has the power of the government as its backing and the use of political power. For the future election campaign, he can manipulate everything and increase the number of voters for his party, so he can expect the parliament to form a majority faction for the government in the future. The Communist Party will be subject to the government's strict and harsh sanctions and restraints, so that the number of voters will not decrease and the left wing will be fatally injured. If this conspiracy can succeed, it will certainly be enough to consolidate the cabinet's position, so that Schleicher can truly implement the dictatorship of the right wing. Otherwise, if the parliament still cannot produce a majority faction for the government in the future, then the fate of the cabinet may not avoid large or small fluctuations. Its future as a disaster or a blessing is not easy to determine. However, according to my humble opinion, Schleicher is indeed the most ideal political figure in Germany in the 14 years after the war. The public admiration and support he receives in Germany is no less than that of Mussolini in Italy. As far as his party is concerned, it is also the largest political party for the Allied countries, with strong momentum and new policies. His position seems to be better than that of Schleicher and others who perform solo shows. Of course, they cannot be mentioned in the same breath. Moreover, Schleicher also has considerable prestige abroad. For Germany's liberation in the 14 years after the war and the anti-Versailles Treaty movement, he can also be said to have made great contributions. Now he has been trusted by the president and supported by the whole country to come to power and form a cabinet. No matter what, it can be predicted that Schleicher will not be able to have a possible long-term position in the future.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>We do not care whether the fate of Schleicher's three-headed cabinet this time is a disaster or a blessing. In short, German politics is actually a state on the right path. Although the parliament has been dissolved several times in the past two years, the so-called parliamentary system of democratic politics has long lost its function and role. The parliament exists in name only, and the voice of the decline of German democratic forces is constantly filling domestic and foreign public opinion. However, because Articles 48 and 25 of the German Constitution empower the government with the full power to take emergency dictatorial measures to deal with the parliament, the dissolution of the parliament is permitted by the constitution and cannot be regarded as an unfair or violent act. Throughout the process, the spirit of the rule of law has not been violated. As for the constant production of cabinet tides, from Brüning to Papen, from Papen to Schleicher, from Schleicher to Schleicher, the political situation has changed rapidly, the political direction has often shifted, and the opinion struggle has been very intense. However, all judgments of victory and defeat in the struggle are based on national public opinion. For example, when national public opinion requested that Brüning take office to form a cabinet, Brüning could certainly respond to the order and come out. Once his policies were not working or the environment was bad and he was unable to do anything, once the public called, Brüning would immediately return the political power to the people of the country, resign and give way to the worthy. As far as Schleicher's cabinet is concerned, Schleicher took office for less than eight weeks. Once he felt that he had no control over politics, he immediately resigned and did not dare to be greedy for office and delay national affairs. In short, the shift of his politics is based on the constitution and centered on political morality and personality. Therefore, the parliament can be dissolved constantly, and the cabinet tides can occur from time to time, but social life will definitely not be harmed or victimized in any way directly. This good phenomenon of the rule of law is truly worthy of our utmost admiration and envy. Looking back at the motherland, every time there is a change in the political situation, there is more exposure to the tragic scene of internal strife and bloodshed. The shift of the government's movements is centered on force, and civil war determines whether it is possible or not. It does not know what political morality and personality are, and it has never escaped the humanity of the barbaric tribal era. Now, such as the Sichuan War and the dispute between the two Lius, who is working hard for whom? This kind of civil war, which is purely based on personal interests, is truly the only factor in the sinking and self-destruction of the Chinese nation. Looking east and west, seeing others and seeing ourselves, why is the difference between Chinese and Western political morality so great? Because of the times and the things, I can't help but add another layer of suffering from the darkness of Chinese politics. (End)</p>
<h3>Re-Convocation of the League of Nations Special Assembly (Part 1)</h3>
<p>Chairman Hymans' Opening Remarks: Japan Bears Sole Responsibility for the Failure of Mediation</p>
<p>Geneva Correspondence: The League of Nations Special Assembly, convened for the Sino-Japanese dispute, was temporarily adjourned on December 9th last year. Subsequently, the Nineteen-Member Committee engaged in mediation in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant. However, the Japanese had no sincere intention to do so, and they took advantage of the end of the year to launch a large-scale invasion of Jehol. Although there was a long period of negotiation and compromise, there was no effect in the end. Therefore, it was necessary to draft a report in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. After the report was drafted, the Special Assembly was reconvened on February 21st to report the failure of the mediation. At 3:30 p.m. that day, it was still chaired by Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans. The gallery was full, as the masses' psychology was eager to hear the wild theories of Japanese representative Yosuke Matsuoka. However, who knew that the meeting would be adjourned immediately after the chairman made his opening remarks, citing the need for the governments of all countries to have sufficient time to study the draft report, which would be reopened three days later? In fact, this was a pre-emptive strike, not giving the Japanese the opportunity to object before the report was discussed. The opening remarks are translated as follows:</p>
<p>(I have just asked you to note that the Special Assembly, at its last meeting on December 9th, instructed the Nineteen-Member Committee to study the report of the Commission of Inquiry and the statements of both China and Japan, as well as the opinions expressed in the Assembly, and to draft proposals to seek a solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute, and to submit the proposals to the Assembly for consideration at the earliest possible date.</p>
<p>The Nineteen-Member Committee, in completing this task, has now prepared two draft proposals and one explanatory memorandum, indicating what basis the continued pursuit of a solution to this dispute should generally take. The draft proposals and explanatory memorandum are attached to pages 12 and following of the draft report. There is no need for me</p>
<p>to read it again.</p>
<p>Since the acceptance of this text, or at least two drafts, should be passed unanimously by the entire Assembly, including both China and Japan, in order to be effective, I believe that it is not necessary to submit the draft proposals to the Assembly for discussion before obtaining the acceptance of the two governments of China and Japan. The Nineteen-Member Committee also agrees with this idea.</p>
<p>The Nineteen-Member Committee has authorized the Secretary-General and myself to proceed with consultations with the delegations of both China and Japan. The texts were sent to the two delegations on December 15th, and the consultations began on December 17th. The Nineteen-Member Committee and its drafting committee were, of course, constantly informed of the consultations.</p>
<p>Both the Chinese and Japanese representatives advocated amendments to the texts, but the amendments first proposed by the Japanese delegation were extensive and of a very different nature. Therefore, it was extremely difficult for the Nineteen-Member Committee to submit draft proposals to the Assembly and to obtain the acceptance of all members of the Assembly, including both China and Japan.</p>
<p>However, the Nineteen-Member Committee was still willing to make efforts to proceed within the possible period, so that the two governments, especially the Japanese government, would have sufficient time to consider the issue and make new proposals. Therefore, the Nineteen-Member Committee decided to postpone the meeting on December 20th and reopen it no later than January 16th, so that the consultations between China and Japan could continue unhindered.</p>
<p>In early January of this year, Shanhaiguan was occupied, and Jehol, which Japan considered to be part of Manchuria, was also under attack, causing the consultation situation to suddenly appear pessimistic. When the Nineteen-Member Committee reopened on January 16th, the Japanese delegation had no new proposals, only saying that they could be submitted in 48 hours. However, the Nineteen-Member Committee still decided to wait further and was unwilling to let months of effort go down the drain.</p>
<p>The Japanese government's new proposals were not sent to the Committee until January 18th. However, these proposals were unacceptable not only to China but also to the Committee itself. However, the Japanese delegation, when submitting the new proposals, specifically stated that the Japanese government attached the greatest importance to the clause in the proposals opposing the participation of non-League of Nations member states in the settlement of the case. Therefore, the Nineteen-Member Committee immediately notified the Japanese delegation that if Japan's opposition was only to this point, then it was not impossible to negotiate further with both China and Japan to seek a solution. The subsequent discussions between the Nineteen-Member Committee and the Japanese delegation were also based on this.</p>
<p>The Japanese delegation stated on January 21st that even if the clause in the proposals inviting non-member states to participate in the settlement of the case was deleted, the Japanese government would still not be able to accept the Committee's text. When making this reply, the Japanese delegation also represented its government in submitting new proposals. However, although the Nineteen-Member Committee's question was met with a "no" from Japan, it still did not refuse to study these new proposals. At the same time, of course, it also considered the amendments of the Chinese and Japanese delegations. After studying and considering them, it was deeply aware that it was impossible to propose a solution acceptable to both parties, at least at this time. The Chinese and Japanese delegations and the Committee itself regarded the invitation of Russia and the United States to participate in the negotiations as very important and could not delete the clause simply because of Japan's request, and at the same time further amend the clauses in the draft in accordance with the opinions put forward by Japan.</p>
<p>Under these circumstances, the Nineteen-Member Committee, in accordance with the resolution of the Assembly of March 11, 1932, decided to begin drafting a report in accordance with Section 4 of Article 15 of the Covenant.</p>
<h3>Pacific Conference</h3>
<p>Discussing the Sino-Japanese Problem</p>
<p>Hu Shih's Speech</p>
<p>The Soviet Union Also Participates in Discussing New Economic Policies</p>
<p>If Japan Does Not Invade, the Pending Case Can Be Resolved</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: The Pacific Conference is scheduled to be held in Canada from August 14th to 28th. Chinese representatives Hu Shih, Jen Hung-chün, Chen Heng-che, Weng Wen-hao, Chang Po-ling, and Ting Wen-chiang plan to attend at that time. This conference is particularly related to the Sino-Japanese problem and international issues in the Pacific. According to Hu Shih, the tasks of this Pacific Conference are described as follows:</p>
<h3>Purpose of the Discussion</h3>
<p>The Pacific Conference holds a general meeting every two years to elect representatives from various countries. The Chinese representatives participating in this conference are Ting Wen-chiang, Weng Wen-hao, Tao Meng-he, Jen Hung-chün, Chen Heng-che, Chou Yi-chun, Chang Yuan-shan, Hsu Shu-hsi, Chang Po-ling, Chang Peng-chun, Ho Lien, and Hu Shih. I myself have decided to attend. The other representatives are still considering it. Whether the representatives will travel together or separately when they depart has not yet been decided. I have no proposals for this conference. The topics to be discussed were determined a year ago. The major topics to be discussed this year are: (1) the economic conditions of various countries; and (2) the diplomatic organs in the Pacific region, including the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, the League of Nations, and many other topics. Experts from various countries are studying them, and the papers of the experts are in preparation. I have no papers, only attending the discussion. The Sino-Japanese problem has no discussion results, because the Pacific Conference can only discuss international issues between countries in the Pacific region and has no resolutions. The purpose of the conference is to invite experts from various countries to jointly study various non-political issues between countries in the Pacific region, to seek appropriate solutions, to provide facts, and to hope that the research on non-political issues will help to solve purely political problems. This Pacific Conference is discussing planned international political and economic issues. The Soviet Union has also elected representatives to attend, which is the first time the Soviet Union has participated in the conference, and it is expected to be of particular interest at that time, because the Soviet Union's five-year plan has been successful, and its planned economic policies are worthy of attention and of course have discussion value.</p>
<h3>Resolving the Sino-Japanese Problem</h3>
<p>Regarding the Sino-Japanese problem, since the Northeast Incident occurred, not only have Japanese troops occupied the entirety of the three Northeastern provinces and created puppet regimes, but they have also invaded the entire province of Jehol. However, we must ask the Japanese: (Have the Chinese submitted? Has there been any progress in resolving the Sino-Japanese problem? Has the international relationship between China and Japan drawn even an inch closer?) A certain Japanese scholar has stated, "Absolutely not!" Even if Japanese violence advances further, even thousands of steps, and within six months or a year, they invade the entirety of North China, push to the entire coastline, and even penetrate deep into the interior of the Yangtze River basin, we can still assert that the Chinese nation will not submit. The Chinese nation's anti-Japanese and animosity towards Japan will only deepen day by day, reaching new heights daily. Resolving the Sino-Japanese problem will only become more and more distant. Even if the day comes when China's (18th and 19th-century armies) are truly completely destroyed by Japan's modern weaponry to the point of being unable to form an army, and even if the Chinese government is forced to accept a humiliating treaty of surrender, we can still assert that this will only be a temporary submission of the Chinese people's flesh and blood. It will not diminish the Chinese people's anti-Japanese sentiment in the slightest, nor will it improve the relationship between China and Japan by even an inch. Because the Chinese national spirit, under this blood baptism, will only grow stronger and stronger day by day. Or, only under this blood baptism will the Chinese nation truly and fiercely transform into Japan's permanent enemy. This is a fact that both common sense and history can guarantee. This is a fact that the Japanese people and government cannot fail to recognize. Japanese patriots and politicians should truly awaken at this time. George Bernard Shaw said to me on February 24th, "(The Japanese cannot conquer China unless they can prepare one policeman for every Chinese person. They cannot conquer China.)" (Mr. Shaw also stated this exact phrase to Japanese reporters in Tokyo a few days ago.) I replied, "(Yes, Japan cannot conquer China through violence. Japan only has one way to conquer China, which is to rein in their horses at the precipice, completely stop invading China, and instead conquer the hearts of the Chinese people.)" This is not an echo of Mr. Shaw's comments. This is my repeated and sincere advice to Japanese friends, and it is also what I want to restate as advice to the Japanese people. Japan can best learn from Germany's policies. I hope that Germany's good students have not forgotten the two historically instructive stories from the era of the German Empire's creation. On June 12, 1866, Prussia declared war on Austria. Within three weeks, the Austrian army was greatly defeated and unable to recover. After Prussia's complete victory, Bismarck advocated for an immediate ceasefire and peace negotiation, ultimately accepting a peace treaty with (no land cession and no indemnity). Bismarck's policy left Austria as Prussia's friendly nation and future ally. Four years later, Prussia went to war with France. Within seven weeks, France was greatly defeated, the French emperor was captured, and Paris was besieged. As a result of the war, France paid an indemnity of 5 billion francs and ceded two provinces. However, this great victory sowed the seeds of an irreconcilable feud between France and Germany for 48 years, leading to the Great War of 1914 and Germany's unprecedented humiliation and suffering in the last 15 years. The lessons of these two stories are worthy of consideration by the entire Japanese nation. The hatred caused by the Japanese warlords' atrocities in China has become quite difficult to eliminate today. But this is when this hatred is at its fiercest and deepest, or when a psychological shift is most likely to occur. "Nine generations of enmity, a hundred years of friendship" all hinge on whether one is aware or unaware. Japanese liberals have boldly declared, "(Japan only needs to stop invading China, and that will be enough.)" We can also respond to Japanese liberals, "(The only way for the Japanese to conquer China is to thoroughly repent for invading China.)" (18th)</p>

<p>Tan Ying Initiates Another Appeal</p>
<p>The case of Shanghai Lianhua Film Company actress Tan Ying falsely accusing Gu Baosen of rape, after being ruled upon by the Shanghai Local Court, was appealed to the High Court, which still ruled that Tan Ying and her mother each receive a two-month prison sentence, suspended for two years. Tan, still dissatisfied, has again retained lawyer Wang Jian to file a third-instance appeal with the Supreme Court.</p>
<h3>Various Industries Request Chamber of Commerce to Promote Tap Water</h3>
<p>The matter of overseas Chinese Xu Liangcheng and others investing in the establishment of a tap water company in Suzhou has been briefly reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that they recently dispatched their authorized representative, Mr. Gong Zhengfang, to Suzhou to make contact, and some initial progress has been made. Mr. Gong has now returned to Shanghai to discuss the investment amount and methods with Xu Liangcheng. Leaders from various industries here believe that this matter is of great importance to commerce, fire prevention, and hygiene, and have jointly suggested that the County Chamber of Commerce promote, support, and advance the project.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Price Reduction Wave in the Silk and Cloth Industry</p>
<p>Daxin Silk and Cloth Store, newly opened at Temple Lane Mouth in the city on the 12th of this month, published advertisements and distributed leaflets in advance, promoting price reductions. Various silk and cloth stores in the county, also in order to attract customers, specially reduced prices on their merchandise before Daxin's opening, offering discounts of 10% or 20%, and even selling sacrifice goods at 60% or 75% off. This caused a sensation throughout the county, and business was booming. On Daxin's side, facing competition from other businesses even before its opening, a banquet was held in the industry association to entertain the leaders of other businesses, requesting them to shorten the period of price reductions and raise prices. Everyone present agreed. However, after returning to their stores, a certain Mr. Jia, the top leader among the businesses, suddenly went back on his agreement and continued to offer special price reductions. This was discovered by all the other businesses, who immediately reduced their prices as well, uniformly lowering prices and using all sorts of promotional methods to attract customers. As a result, the doors of various silk and cloth stores were crowded, with business booming. The sacrifice goods were especially popular, and there were many customers eager to find bargains. Yesterday, the Tongyun Road Cloth Factory wholesale store also sold cheap remnants of cloth, causing a sensation with thousands of customers from the city and countryside. It almost became a riot, but fortunately, persuasion was effective, and no accidents occurred.</p>
<h3>Changzhou</h3>
<p>Merchant Shipping Vessel Robbed En Route</p>
<p>The Changyi night shift Junlong vessel of the Wuyi Merchant Shipping Bureau, towing the Shunli tugboat, while sailing past the Camel Bridge east of the Zhaiqiao in the Eighth District, about five li away, the previous evening, suddenly heard gunshots, and someone shouted from the north bank. Five or six armed bandits boarded the vessel, while more than ten others on the west bank crossed to the Shunli tugboat in a small boat. Entering the cabin, they searched and robbed each passenger one by one, then entered the accounting room and the rear cabin, looting everything. Suddenly, alarms were heard nearby, and the bandits fled.</p>

<h3>Police Officer Induces Abduction of Young Girl Case</h3>
<p>Guo Zheng, a woman from Baoying, has a son and a daughter. Her son earns a living pulling a rickshaw in the town, and her daughter is also married to a rickshaw puller. Unexpectedly, on the 19th of this month, the daughter suddenly ran away in secret. The woman searched everywhere but could not find her, and was extremely anxious. Wang Shengtang, a police officer from the Second Squad, often visited her home, and she suspected that Wang was involved in inducing the abduction. A few days ago, she brought Wang to the Third Precinct. Officer Ding interrogated him and sent him to the General Bureau, where Section Chief Dai opened a court hearing. According to Guo Zheng's testimony, she is 58 years old and from Baoying. Wang Shengtang often came to my house and said that it was a pity that my daughter was married to a rickshaw puller. Later, he also instigated my daughter on the road, and my daughter gradually showed signs of disregard. She disappeared the next day, so I brought Wang in for questioning. According to Wang Shengtang's testimony, he is 28 years old and from Hunan, and serves as a police officer in the Second Squad. Because her family does my laundry, I have been to her house a few times. The day before yesterday, I went to her house, and she said that her daughter had run away and asked me to inquire. Later, she came to the squad to find me and was scolded away by a colleague. I saw that she was worried and comforted her. I really don't know the circumstances of her daughter's escape. After hearing the testimonies, Section Chief Dai, seeing that both sides had different stories, sent both parties to the court yesterday afternoon for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou</h3>
<p>Provincial Order to Raise Funds for Airplane Donations</p>
<p>County Magistrate Ma recently received a provincial order to raise 20,000 yuan for airplane donations to purchase aircraft to resist the Japanese invaders. He presented this matter at the county government meeting yesterday and invited Mr. Dai Jingshan, chairman of the Chamber of Commerce, to attend. The meeting decided that various county agencies, organizations, and schools would donate, and that they would also actively solicit donations from the salt industry and businesses in various districts.</p>

<p>Opening of National Goods Mobile Exhibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Factory Federation, after holding a mobile exhibition in Jiashan, has transported it to Jiaxing and displayed it in the People's Education Hall. It opened at 9:00 AM on the 21st. More than 20 factories are participating, but not as many as in previous years. In addition to displaying their goods, the manufacturers are also holding discounted sales. After the exhibition in Jiaxing, it will be transported to Pinghu for exhibition.</p>
<h3>Huzhou</h3>
<p>Child Crushed to Death by Car</p>
<p>Fang Baoxing, a resident of Ping'an Lane in the city's West Gate, is 40 years old and works at the Dalun Shoe Store. His wife, surnamed Mou, has a son named Laide, who is 13 years old. Yesterday afternoon, he went out to play with several classmates outside the South Gate. While walking past the Yangqiao pier near the Huzhou Station, a No. 616 empty freight car on the Beijing-Hangzhou Highway came head-on. Seeing the car, Laide panicked and ran, causing him to be hit by the car. The wheels ran over the child's body, injuring the back of his head, his waist, and his back. Upon hearing the news, the Huzhou Station detained the driver, Yu Xixiang, and handed him over to the Public Security Ninth Sub-bureau for custody. At the same time, they sent personnel to carry Laide to the nearby Gospel Hospital for treatment. After examination by the hospital doctor, it was determined that the injuries were too severe to be treated, and they instructed him to be carried back home. He died before arriving. Fang Baoxing and his wife cried bitterly upon seeing their son's tragic death. Baoxing reported the incident to the court for investigation.</p>

<h3>Telegram Presented to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Respectfully presented to the Executive Committee of the Central Party Headquarters in Nanjing. Unfortunately for the nation, externally, there are rampant foreign invaders, and internally, there are disturbances by red bandits. The nation's lifeline is hanging by a thread, and the situation is as precarious as a pile of eggs. At this time of increasing difficulty and pressing calamity, if we want to resist strong enemies and eliminate the red atmosphere, it will not be possible without gathering the nation's military forces. Although Chairman Chiang has been entrusted with important military authority, it is limited by the military commission system, which prevents the centralization of power and makes unified command difficult. Now that the flames of the invaders are burning brighter and pressing us more and more, the entire country has fallen into a state of emergency. We request that the committee immediately decide to grant Chairman Chiang the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, so that military power can be unified and dispatching can be facilitated. The future of resistance against Japan deeply depends on this. This telegram is submitted with utmost urgency. The Shanghai City General Labor Union respectfully kowtows and stamps.</p>
<h3>Telegram to Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>Respectfully presented to Chairman Chiang in Baoding. Recently, in the Battle of Rehe, the traitor Tang Yulin abandoned the city and fled without even seeing the enemy's shadow, causing the vast province of Rehe to fall into enemy hands in less than two weeks. This has brought shame to the nation and ridicule from foreign countries. The pain of this matter is beyond words. Protecting the nation and defending against violence is the great duty of a soldier. Even if ammunition is exhausted and reinforcements are cut off, they should continue to fight with their flesh and blood. How can they shrink back from battle or even retreat without a fight? Now that the violent Japanese are exerting all their strength to continue their advance, the survival of the nation is at stake. We hope that you will issue an order to all frontline soldiers as soon as possible, instructing them to only advance and not retreat during combat. Even if there are major sacrifices, they should not be spared. This will revitalize our national spirit and fight for our national dignity. Our people in the rear will do our utmost to provide the frontline soldiers resisting the Japanese with full support. This telegram is respectfully delivered, and we humbly request your review. The Shanghai City General Labor Union respectfully kowtows and stamps.</p>
<h3>Soong Tzu-wen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Expressing His Resignation from the Position of Acting President of the Executive Yuan</p>
<p>Soong Tzu-wen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, returned to Nanjing with Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan. However, due to financial problems, he took the Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train to Shanghai with Secretary Huang Chundao the night before. He arrived at the Zhenru Station at 7:45 AM yesterday morning and returned to his residence to rest. At about 10:00 AM, he met with important figures in the banking industry, such as Li Fuxun, to discuss matters. It is heard that Soong stated to others that President Wang had already arrived in Nanjing and that someone was in charge of the important political responsibilities. He has already resigned from the position of Acting President of the Executive Yuan to focus on financial responsibilities.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Returned to Nanjing Last Night</h3>
<p>Sun Ke, the President of the Legislative Yuan, came to Shanghai this time to welcome Wang. He originally intended to go to Nanjing with Wang, but there were still several matters at the Sun Yat-sen Culture and Education Center that needed to be resolved by Sun. Therefore, he took a train to Nanjing last night to attend the Central Political Conference.</p>
<h3>Expiration and Abolition of Tariff Reciprocity Agreement</h3>
<p>Japanese Side Seemingly Expresses Agreement China Disregards Renewal, and the Other Side Has No Right to Compel</p>
<p>According to Xinsheng News Agency, a spokesman for the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai stated to a Xinsheng News Agency reporter yesterday that the Japanese side had agreed to abolish Parts A and B of the annex to the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement, which expires on May 15 (i.e., the provisions for reciprocity). Since China is unwilling to renew the agreement, the Japanese side has no right to compel it. However, the text of the agreement is unrelated to the abolition of Parts A and B of the annex. According to an interpretation by diplomatic circles, the abolition of the reciprocal part of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement is indeed unrelated to the text of the agreement. The newspaper's reports and the demands of various circles to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs seem to have a similar lack of clarity regarding its contents. The text of the agreement consists of five articles. Articles 1, 2, and 3 state that it is entirely about tariff autonomy, mutual equal treatment, and that the treatment of ships should not be inferior to that of other countries. Articles 4 and 5 concern the standard of language used in the agreement and its duration. There is no expiration date mentioned, and it is unrelated to the abolition of the reciprocal goods section. What is stipulated in the annex to the agreement is divided into Parts A and B. Part A contains four items: cotton goods, fish and seafood products, flour, and miscellaneous goods, which are imported into China from Japan and are granted reciprocal treatment. Except for item 4, which stipulated a one-year term and was abolished on May 15, 1931, the remaining items 1, 2, and 3 will be abolished on May 15 of this year, together with the three items in Part B. Part B concerns Chinese goods exported to Japan, which are granted reciprocal treatment by Japan. This part only includes ramie cloth, silk, and embroidered goods, and there is no item 4 that maintains a one-year term. Moreover, the names of the items listed are not as numerous as those in Part A. Abolition is advantageous to our side. As for the expiration date, rumors of May 6 or May 16 are incorrect. It is actually May 15. The signing date of the agreement was May 6, and it stipulated that it would take effect ten days from the date of signing. Therefore, May 16 is the date the agreement took effect, and May 15 is the exact date of expiration.</p>
<h3>City Federation</h3>
<p>Issued Important Documents Yesterday</p>
<p>Telegram Sent to the Entire Country</p>
<p>Report Submitted to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Letter Sent to the Taxpayer Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Special District No. 1 Citizens Federation issued several letters and reports yesterday based on the resolutions of the first meeting of the second session of representatives, recorded below.</p>
<h3>Should Assist Financial Resources</h3>
<p>转各报馆转全国同胞公鉴 (转各报馆转全国同胞公鉴 - duplicated in original) Transfer to the entire country's compatriots to know that the Japanese invaders are gaining ground and the province of East is conquered. The goal of the Japanese invaders is nowhere near stopped. If the country does not work together to resist the aggression, the lands that were conquered are not easily to be reattained. The country would be under the oppression of the Japanese invaders. It would be hard to find an escape. Luckily, Commander Chiang is now resisting from the Northern border. The goal is to create a strategy and plan to defeat the Japanese. Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Wang Yizhe, Guan Lin and others are all fighting to defend the country. South West will also mobilize soon. Under the command of Cai Tingkai, Director Chiang, who previously had great merits, and with the administration of President Wang, The central party is now listening to the public. Therefore, our people should contribute money and effort, boycott Japanese goods, use the national goods, so that the people and the government can work together. And there is a success in the nation and the revolution. Please let us make a sincere remark and get your approval. Sincerely from Shanghai Citizens Federation.</p>
<h3>Organizing Defense Corps</h3>
<p>The association submitted the following to the Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday: Respectfully submitted, organizing a defense corps (now renamed a team) is stipulated by national government laws and regulations and is mandatory. Inland provinces and counties have already implemented it. Shanghai is our country's economic center and cultural hub. It seems inappropriate not to implement it here. Moreover, after the January 28th incident when the Japanese invaders disturbed Shanghai, the necessity of establishing a defense corps became even more apparent. Shanghai has a total population of 3.5 million. If we calculate 1/10 of it, there would be approximately 350,000 corps members who should serve. Dividing them into five years of training, there would be 70,000 people each year. If Shanghai has 30,000 active-duty soldiers and 350,000 people receive military training, they can assist the military in peacetime and serve as reserves for the national army in wartime. This is cost-effective and highly effective, fulfilling national laws and regulations while increasing local strength. It is truly a win-win situation. Now that this association's representative conference has resolved to submit a request to organize it, we hereby respectfully submit this letter for your review and approval, as it is for the public good. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Government.</p>
<h3>Requesting Reduction of Electricity Fees</h3>
<p>The association sent a letter to the Shanghai Concession Ratepayers Association yesterday: We are writing to inform you that, starting from January 1 of last year, the Shanghai Power Company requested the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession to approve a price increase, citing high coal prices. Now, coal prices have fallen, and the company is also using East China coal, and the East Exchange rate has fallen significantly compared to before. The cost of coal is much lower than when prices were raised. However, the company is not reducing electricity fees as a result, which shows that it is prioritizing private interests over public interests. The Municipal Council is not correcting this, which is very confusing. We are hereby writing to your association, based on the resolution of this association's representative conference, requesting you to send a letter to the Municipal Council, exercising the powers of an impartial body to uphold the principle of fairness.</p>
<h3>Protesting Water Prices</h3>
<p>The association sent a letter to the Concession Ratepayers Association yesterday: We are writing to inform you that water is indispensable to citizens' daily lives. Therefore, municipal authorities in civilized countries attach great importance to water supply, seeking cleanliness, low prices, and sufficiency. The Shanghai Concession's water company's charging methods were originally very reasonable, sufficiently regulating the rich and poor and adapting to prices. However, due to the Municipal Council's high-interest guarantee and the pound capital, a surcharge trend occurred. Unexpectedly, the company's greed was insatiable, and it imposed a price increase under the guise of installing meters to control waste. The Municipal Council also allowed it, and water was cut off as soon as there was any opposition, and the Municipal Council sent police to suppress it, which is a great loss to the purpose of municipal authorities. We are hereby writing to your association, based on the resolution of this representative conference, requesting you to actively oppose it and instruct the Municipal Council to quickly amend the contract to protect the interests of taxpayers. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Concession Ratepayers Association.</p>
<h3>Jewish Capital Can Sell Chinese Goods</h3>
<p>Foreign Merchant Asks to Dispatch Personnel to Manage</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry yesterday ordered the International Trade Bureau: This is to order compliance. Approved a Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatch stating: Approved a letter from foreign merchant Sgoberik stating: I have been residing in the Jewish capital for twelve years and grew up in China. I am very familiar with the political and economic situation in China and here. Currently, Japanese goods are selling well here, and there are reports of a consulate being established in the near future. According to what I believe, industry and commerce are not very developed here. If the Chinese government could dispatch personnel to manage everything, Chinese goods would definitely sell well here and become a strong enemy of Japanese goods. Please appoint me as consul to facilitate progress, etc. There are not many overseas Chinese in the Jewish capital, and there is not much commercial relationship with our country. There is no need to establish it temporarily. However, since the letter stated that industry and commerce are not very developed there and that Chinese goods can be expected to sell well, we can inform our country's industrial and commercial circles so that they can communicate directly with the foreign merchant for business intelligence and to benefit the promotion of domestic goods. It may not be without benefit. Accordingly, a copy of the original letter is sent for your ministry to review and handle and reply. Approved, therefore, a copy of the original document in foreign language is sent, ordering you to transfer the order to various industrial and commercial circles as necessary.</p>
<h3>Second Batch of Antiquities Transported South</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday and Will Be Unloaded This Morning</p>
<p>Stored in the Central Bank Warehouse on Tiantang Street</p>
<p>The second batch of antiquities transported south from the Palace Museum in Beiping and the first batch of archives stored in Nanjing were loaded onto the Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Kuaili ship in Pukou the day before. It set sail east at 3:00 PM and docked at Jinliyuan Wharf at 1:10 PM yesterday afternoon. Because it was late, it was not transported. It was decided to start transporting it into the Central Bank warehouse for storage at 7:00 AM this morning. The details are recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Escorting Personnel</h3>
<p>The people escorting the antiquities from Nanjing to Shanghai included Yu Tongkui, director of the Palace Museum, leading a staff of X people, Lu Xirong, director of the Ministry of Interior, Zhang Guoxiang, section chief, and Chen Rui, counselor, He Can, section chief, Wang Jinliang, secretary Zhai Zonghan, and Lin Qiuhai, assigned by the Executive Yuan as supervision personnel. Li Yimou and Cai Zhiang, inspectors from the Military Police Headquarters, and the Second Company of Military Police accompanied the ship for protection.</p>
<h3>Detailed Number of Antiquities</h3>
<p>According to Yu Tongkui, director of the Palace Museum, who spoke to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, there are a total of 2,554 boxes of antiquities arriving in Shanghai this time. Among them, there were 1,064 boxes from the first batch transported south, which were originally stored in the auditorium of the Executive Yuan in Nanjing. They are now being transported to Shanghai with the second batch. The second batch of antiquities transported south belonging to the Palace Museum includes 814 boxes from the Antiquities Museum, 44 boxes from the Library, and 412 boxes from the Archives Museum. The archives are also items from the Archives Museum, totaling 1,476 boxes. There are 20 boxes of miscellaneous items, totaling 1,290 boxes. Belonging to the Beiping Antiquities Exhibition Hall of the Ministry of Interior, there are 200 boxes.</p>
<h3>Third Batch Undecided</h3>
<p>The antiquities transported to Shanghai this time, apart from the first batch of archives transported south, are all scattered miscellaneous items. The items in the Antiquities Museum are mostly calligraphy and jade artifacts. There are also many books in the Library, which are not like the large sets of books transported south in the first instance. The total number of the first batch arriving in Shanghai was 1,054 boxes. This time there are 2,554 boxes, totaling 3,608 boxes. As to whether there will be a third transport south, it depends on the situation and the orders of the Executive Yuan.</p>
<h3>Wharf Security</h3>
<p>The Kuaili ship docked at Jinliyuan Wharf at 2:10 PM. The French Concession Police Department sent more than 30 Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to stand guard. The Bund road along the Kuaili ship was cordoned off with hemp ropes at both ends to cut off traffic. All of the lighters were also filled with detectives. At 3:00 PM, it was decided to start transporting the goods today, so part of them were withdrawn, leaving three people standing guard on the road and five people (three Chinese and two Westerners) patrolling the lighter. The Municipal Public Security Bureau's water patrol team was on guard outside the ship.</p>
<h3>Storing This Morning</h3>
<p>Because the time was too late yesterday, it was feared that it would not be possible to transport all of them ashore, so they were not transported. Starting at 7:00 AM this morning, the transport will begin, still handled by the Maotai Company, using more than a dozen cars to transport them back and forth to the Central Bank warehouse at No. 26 Tiantang Street for storage. The French Concession Police Department will send one patrolman and one detective to protect each car. (Xinsheng News Agency)</p>
<h3>Hand Grenade Found on Foch Road the Night Before</h3>
<p>Zhang Xueliang Suffers a False Alarm</p>
<p>At 7:40 PM the night before, someone threw a hand grenade next to the bamboo fence of the east gate of Zhang Xueliang's residence at No. 181 Foch Road in the French Concession. The grenade landed in the gap at the kitchen doorway and exploded with a loud noise, shaking the roof tiles. Zhang was sitting idle in the new building when he suddenly heard the loud noise and ordered someone to investigate. At first, those around him suspected that it was a car tire exploding, but the chef reported that the loud noise came from nearby and that there was a strong smell of gunpowder. As a result, a hand grenade shell was found next to the icebox on the left side of the house, with a small, broken stool nearby and two wooden sticks in the center blown to pieces. After confirming, the detectives sent by the French Concession Police Department for protection immediately reported to the police department by phone. Deputy Commissioner of Police Raubert, Political Director Serre, and many detectives rushed to inspect the scene, picked up the damaged grenade shell, and took it back for filing and investigation. At the same time, the Public Concession also sent many Chinese and Western detectives to the border to take a look. Before long, those who heard the news and rushed to express their condolences arrived one after another.</p>

The standing council has appointed Executive Director Chen Yafu to be responsible for assisting in this endeavor. We are sending this letter specifically to inform you and express our gratitude. We hope you will take note.</p>
<h3>Liang Daxing Contributes Funeral Expenses to Support the Military</h3>
<p>Mr. Liang Daxing, recognizing that the volunteer soldiers outside the Great Wall are enduring hardships and fighting the Japanese with great determination, has contributed the funeral expenses for his deceased father to the Liaojihei Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association. Such sentiments are heartening, and the future of the nation can be viewed with optimism. The original letter is recorded below: To the Honorable Members of the Liaojihei Rehe Volunteer Army Support Association: The gentlemen of the Lianbao Company, Li Feng, and others, have generously donated 25 yuan in Shanghai Bank gift certificates for the passing of my late father, Zhi Xian. I believe that the people of the Northeast are shedding blood and charging into battle, enduring hardships and gnawing on snow, to protect the country and bring glory to the nation. Instead of wasting useless paper money, how about offering a small contribution to help provide food? I am sending this certificate to your association and request that you forward it to the volunteer army at the front. I respectfully wish you peace. Liang Daxing pays his respects.</p>
<h3>Anhui Prisoners Save Food to Aid the Volunteer Army</h3>
<p>Inmates Zhu Liyan, Chen Jinglu, Wang Linchuan, Chen Huizhi, and others, 151 male prisoners and Zhao Zhou's, Fan Liang's, and others, 19 female prisoners in the West Prison of Sixian County, Anhui Province, collectively reduced their food rations for three days and accumulated 10 yuan in foreign currency to aid the volunteer army. They jointly sent a letter to the Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, stating: We are prisoners in prison, but we are fortunate to receive rations from the country. Last autumn, when Prison Officer He Guan took office, he saw that the prisoners' rations were purchased and eaten on their own, and they were not able to satisfy their hunger. Therefore, he urgently sought ways to help, first establishing a cooking area and then creating a factory for weaving cloth. As we prisoners were working diligently in prison, we suddenly heard that the Japanese pirates had invaded our eastern lands in the September 18th Incident last year. Fortunately, our country's volunteer army vowed to kill the enemy, and we also received donations from all over the country. Upon hearing this, we were all moved to tears. Alas, we prisoners are sons of the Yellow Emperor, originating from the Central Plains, and we regret being trapped in prison, unable to jump out and kill the enemy. Now, we prisoners are willing to reduce our food rations for three days and contribute 10 yuan in foreign currency to help the volunteer army kill the enemy. We respectfully request the prison officials to allow us to send the funds to Shanghai and humbly ask you not to disdain our meager contribution. We also hope that the newspapers will inform all prisoners in prisons across the country to work diligently. If prisoners are useful in fighting the enemy, we are willing to use our flesh and blood to block the enemy's advance. If we can annihilate all the enemies in one fell swoop, it will be a great honor for our country. Otherwise, our spirits will forever guard the border and defend our country.</p>
<h3>Dangerous Situation of the Songkou Seawall</h3>
<p>Damaged by Tides for Days</p>
<p>Jin County Magistrate Requests Funds for Emergency Repairs</p>
<p>Due to the recent hurricanes in Wusongkou, the seawall in the area north of the Lion Grove Rock Cave has been eroded by the wind and tides and is gradually collapsing, creating a dangerous situation. Jin Jinqingzhang, the magistrate of Baoshan County, convened a meeting of various agencies to discuss the matter. As a result, 195 zhang of the northern section of the Yanchi segment of the Beishidong project and 60 zhang of the main project of the Zhangjiazhaid seawall are considered to be in critical condition and urgently need repair. It was resolved to submit a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, instructing the Construction Department to allocate the remaining 21,000 yuan from the emergency repairs in the 20th year of the Republic to meet the urgent need.</p>
<h3>Puppet Representative</h3>
<p>Ding Shiyuan Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>One rumor says he is returning on the same ship, another says he will stay in Shanghai for activities.</p>
<p>He Temporarily Hid in the Ship's Toilet to Disembark, Living in Seclusion</p>
<p>Far East News Agency reports: Ding Shiyuan, the representative dispatched by the puppet organization to Geneva and various European countries to lobby, has now returned in a disheveled state because the League of Nations report has been passed and his mission in Europe is over. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 9:00 am aboard the Japanese postal ship Haruna Maru, which docked at the Huishan Wharf in Hongkou. According to the investigation, when the ship arrived at the port, Ding, knowing that he was a traitor, was afraid of attracting attention, so he hid in the ship's toilet and dared not disembark. Then, at 2:00 pm that afternoon, he took the original ship to Kobe, transferred to a train to Tokyo, and returned to the puppet country to report.</p>
<p>China United News Agency reports: The puppet organization representative Ding Shiyuan went to various European countries to defend Japan's aggressive policies and vigorously slander our country's internal affairs. After experiencing cold shoulders in Geneva, London, Paris, and other places, he had no choice but to return dejectedly on the Japanese ship Haruna. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 9:00 am and planned to stay in Shanghai for a week before flattering and begging the foreign expatriates in Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, Ding hid in a certain country's agency and lived in seclusion. He was protected by Japanese police when he went out to prevent assassination.</p>

<p>Industry representatives present included: Liu Houmin, Zhang Wendi, Dong Kunfan, Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, Zheng Chengqing, Wang Zhengji, Wang Shijie, Chen Binghui, Dong Guangying, Dong Rixin, Lu Qisheng, Jin Yinwu, Zhu Baoyuan, Chen Yizhou, Mo Keming, Yu Tinghui, Zhang Xianglin, Wang Songyou, Zhu Dechao, Wu Zhihao, Wang Honghui, Wu Guangzhi, Zhou Guanhong, Shao Dehui, Lin Kanghou, and Xiong Zhifu.</p>
<h3>Reporting the Purpose</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported: Since the government decided to cancel China's participation in the Chicago Exposition due to urgent military needs and financial difficulties, we deeply understand the government's extraordinary measures. However, considering the international perspective and economic difficulties, we have jointly agreed to participate automatically under the name of the Republic of China's Chicago Exposition Exhibitor Association, under the guidance and assistance of the government. We have also formulated articles of association, drafted participation procedures, and concrete measures, and submitted them to the Ministry of Industry for record and to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for review. We have also forwarded them to the U.S. Minister in China for review and telegraphed the Consul General in Chicago to provide guidance for our participation in the United States to facilitate the process. We have limited capabilities and a heavy responsibility. Fortunately, since the establishment of our association, we have received support and assistance from various circles, and the scale has been roughly established. However, international activities require collective efforts to be effective. Now, to seek assistance and guidance, we are briefly reporting the preliminary plans, preparations, and general budget: 1. This association will use basic exhibits such as lacquerware, porcelain, pottery, silk, embroidery, jade, carpets, summer cloth, tea, carvings, and art as the basis for its structure. 2. All expenses for exhibits should be coordinated and prepaid by the association as a whole, regardless of territorial divisions. The total amount required is 150,000 yuan in foreign currency. A special economic committee will be formed under this association to handle economic matters. A summary of the budget is listed separately. (3) In addition to the exhibits collected by this association, other exhibits or books and brochures submitted by the government or groups of manufacturers for participation and that do not affect the budget of this association will be transported to the United States for display by this association. (4) All exhibits should be shipped to the United States by the end of the month. (5) For the convenience of carrying out the association's affairs, Zhang Xianglin, the director of the preparatory committee's office, should be hired by this association to travel to the United States to assist in all matters. (6) This association should request the government to telegraph Minister Shi to personally attend the opening ceremony of the Chinese pavilion at the Chicago Exposition. (7) When members of this association travel abroad, they must inspect themselves and their belongings to avoid problems. (6) Standards for the construction of the special pavilion and its budget: (A) The architectural plan was drafted by the American architectural expert Murphy. (B) The architectural form is a city wall and drum tower, or a surrounding wall with exhibition rooms built inside, and a garden in the center. (C) The building</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>will occupy a portion of the original site of the government pavilion, with an area of approximately 38,400 square feet (at least 20,000 square feet). (D) According to Murphy's estimate, the construction completion time is at most six weeks. (E) The estimated construction cost is approximately US$15,000. If the actual cost is insufficient, it will be transferred from the reserve fund. (F) The construction supervision work is to be undertaken by the engineer Guo Yuanzhao, who is currently in Chicago. (G) To ensure the reliability of the construction reserve fund, this association will prepay US$10,000, entrusted to the representative of the Chicago Exposition in Shanghai, the Counselor of the US Embassy in China, Anno, to be directly remitted to the Chicago Exposition and designated as the construction cost of the Chinese pavilion. (9) The above construction standards have been telegraphed by Anno and this association to the Chicago Exposition Authority, the Chinese Consulate in Chicago, and Engineer Guo for review. Construction can begin as soon as the government formally notifies us. The preliminary participation plan of this association is roughly as described above. However, we have recently received a telegram from the Chicago Exposition Authority through US Counselor Anno: (1) The architectural cost estimated by Murphy, which we requested, is considered insufficient. (2) The meeting period is urgent, and we are concerned that the construction cannot be completed as scheduled. After discussion, this association intends to slightly change the construction standards to fit the budget. However, this is just a proposal based on the current situation of this association. If we can expand the organization, it will be easy to remedy. As for the construction deadline, if funding is not a problem, there will be no problem in reality. This is our humble opinion, and we hope to receive your enlightenment.</p>
<h3>Resolutions Passed</h3>
<p>The following resolutions were passed: (1) Wang Xiaolai and Yu Qiaqing will immediately go to Beijing to request assistance from the government. (2) Lin Kanghou will be sent to the preparatory committee for participation in the Chicago Exposition to investigate whether there are any remaining funds, which will be allocated to this association's expenses. (3) Zhang Xianglin will be appointed as the representative to prepare all matters for going abroad. (4) The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various commercial organizations will be united to expand the organization and increase the number of directors. (5) A meeting will be held at the original location at 2:00 pm on the 24th (Friday) to discuss a proactive approach.</p>

<h3>Dependents of Wang Delin's Troops Come South</h3>
<p>Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on the 26th</p>
<p>188 family members and wounded soldiers of General Wang Delin's troops in the Heilongjiang Volunteer Army arrived in Tianjin from Vladivostok on the Wuyoung. Except for 19 wounded soldiers who disembarked in Tianjin and went to Beiping, 158 family members of Wang Delin's troops boarded the Wuyoung again and came to Shanghai. Yesterday, we received confirmation that the Wuyoung is now going to Yantai to load salt and then to Qingdao to transport goods before sailing to Shanghai. It is expected that it will not arrive in Shanghai until the 26th of this month.</p>
<p>The Local Association received a telegram from Beiping yesterday stating that Liang Yuanshan, the representative of Wang Delin, commander of the National Salvation Army, said in a telegram that Wang Delin's troops and their families had entered Russia and were being welcomed back to China by a ship sent by the central government. There are a total of 188 people. Except for 19 wounded soldiers and the families of Brigade Commander Zheng Xing, 158 family members are going directly to Shanghai. Please telegraph the agencies in Shanghai to provide extra assistance and care so that they do not freeze or starve. Please inform the charitable organizations to provide assistance and care. Support Association, Hao.</p>
<h3>Yu Mingzhou, Secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Reported on the Current Situation in Heilongjiang and Requested Assistance!</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, Chairman Ma appointed Yu Mingzhou, a member of the Heilongjiang Provincial Party Committee, as the commander-in-chief of the Heilongjiang Self-Defense Army, leading the Heilongjiang militia in a bitter battle against the enemy. Due to the depletion of ammunition and lack of reinforcements, he led his troops into the mountains to wait for an opportunity to move. Yu himself, along with Xun Shaoliang, commander-in-chief of the First Route Army of the Northeast National Salvation Army, detoured to Beijing and arrived in Shanghai a few days ago to report the current situation in Heilongjiang to all sectors and hoped to provide assistance so that he could take advantage of the enemy's concentration in the Jehol area and the emptiness of the rear to lead his troops in a counterattack and disrupt the enemy's rear to achieve a pincer effect.</p>
<h3>Achievements of the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau in Dredging the Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Shallow Shoal of Yujidun Has Also Been Dredged Deeper</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports: Since the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau was entrusted by the Municipal Government to deepen and widen the Suzhou Creek, the downstream navigation channel has greatly improved. The previously narrow and silted riverbed can now accommodate ships with a draft of five feet for three miles upstream from the confluence of the Suzhou Creek and the Huangpu River. After four more years of work, this depth can be maintained for thirteen miles above the confluence. According to the Huangpu Conservancy Bureau, since being entrusted to dredge the river, the specified depth is at least five feet below the low water line, and the width is at least seventy-five feet. Construction began on February 11th of the 20th year of the Republic. By the end of February of this year, 625,000 cubic feet of silt, or approximately 700,000 tons, had been excavated. The dredging has now reached the vicinity of Binlang Road, and the shallow shoal of Yujidun, which is an obstacle to navigation thirteen miles upstream, has also been dredged deeper. It is understood that the river extends for thirteen and a half miles within the jurisdiction of Shanghai and is scheduled to be dredged for six years. Currently, there are four dredgers, two tugboats, and five barges operating to transport the mud. Sometimes, cranes or divers are used to remove stones and other heavy objects. The engineering personnel of the bureau also go to supervise the work from time to time.</p>
<h3>Japanese Warships Measure the Depth of Our Waterways</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, rumors of an alert in Tianjin and Dagukou spread in Shanghai. Because a ship was scheduled to sail to Tianjin today, various shipping companies in the city telegraphed Tianjin to inquire, but no reply had been received by the evening. Yesterday, a passenger from Tianjin and the owner of a Chinese shipping company told reporters that when their ships left Tianjin and Dagukou, the situation in Tianjin was quite calm. However, about thirteen miles from the Dagukou, four Japanese destroyers and one cruiser were seen. As they passed by, the Japanese warships were sending their naval surveying team, led by officers, to measure the depth of the water along the Dagukou and Baihe River by means of small boats, and they were secretly marking shallower areas. Otherwise, nothing else was seen. Yesterday, when the ships arrived in Shanghai and passed outside the Wusongkou, the Japanese flagship Izumo, which was conducting target practice and firing cannons outside Flower Island, was seen returning to Shanghai. The Japanese warship proceeded first, and about three miles outside of Baolonggang, the warship also sent a surveying team to measure the depth of the water along the Pudong coast.</p>
<h3>China Relief Association Seeks Members</h3>
<p>To Expand Domestic Relief Efforts</p>
<p>Since the China Relief Association announced the news of its medical team going north, people from all walks of life have sent hundreds of letters requesting to join. In order to expand domestic relief efforts, the association is now seeking members. Those who have a patriotic spirit and want to contribute can write to the association's office at the intersection of Route Edward VII and Xizang Road to obtain the charter.</p>
<h3>New U.S. Marine Corps Commander</h3>
<p>Colonel Carke Visits Mayor Wu</p>
<p>Colonel Hawke, the former commander of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, has been replaced by Colonel Carke due to illness. Carke assumed office a few days ago. Yesterday morning, Carke, accompanied by two military attachés, visited Mayor Wu at the City Hall on Fenglin Bridge, exchanging pleasantries. They spoke for about twenty minutes before departing. It is understood that Carke was a senior official in the U.S. Marine Corps headquarters in Shanghai and is familiar with the situation in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>The Philanthropic Society Hosted Guests Yesterday</h3>
<p>Screening of Sound Films to Console Soldiers</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Renlin, Director-General of the Nanjing Philanthropic Society, hosted a banquet yesterday at the Star Film Company to entertain guests from all walks of life. More than sixty Chinese and foreign guests attended. Mr. Huang delivered a speech during the dinner, expressing regret that the Philanthropic Society had not had the opportunity to benefit from the guidance of Shanghai's community during its four years of existence. He then stated that in the midst of the anti-Japanese movement, the entire nation was mobilized. Based on its purpose of serving soldiers, the Philanthropic Society should work diligently. He also mentioned that he had been instructed by Chairman Chiang to organize an inspection group for wounded soldiers, to travel to the front lines to provide services. To convey the sincerity of the people in comforting soldiers at the front, the Society had commissioned Star Film Company to produce four sound films, featuring words of comfort from prominent figures in the Party and business leaders. He further stated that he had repeatedly received telegrams from staff on the front lines requesting a large number of transport trucks. He immediately appealed for donations and was grateful to the Shanghai Construction Association for pledging one truck, Mr. Zhu Maocheng for pledging to solicit one, and the Shanghai YMCA for also being in the process of soliciting donations. He extended sincere thanks on behalf of the soldiers on the front lines. At 7:30 PM, the guests viewed the sound films and a mobile film vehicle. The sound was clear, and the vehicle was extremely convenient, capable of generating its own electricity, making it a unique propaganda tool in China. The event concluded with the guests and hosts enjoying themselves until 10:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Disaster Relief Funds for Zhabei Residents</h3>
<p>30,000 Yuan to be Issued Next Week</p>
<p>Disaster Victims Petitioned the War Zone Authorities Yesterday</p>
<p>The United Association of Disaster Victims in Zhabei stated that after receiving housing loans last year, they immediately began construction. However, due to the lack of the third installment of the loan (only two installments, totaling one hundred yuan, were issued), construction was halted midway. It has been more than four months, and the houses still under construction are vulnerable to wind and rain, potentially collapsing and causing injury. Therefore, yesterday, they sent representatives Shen Wenbin and three others to petition the Shanghai War Zone Relief Committee, requesting the immediate allocation of the 30,000 yuan relief fund due from the Shanghai North Charity Race to enable early completion. They also requested the early distribution of loans to the second batch of disaster victims (who have not yet received any funds). Secretary Lin Xiannan of the Committee received them and explained that the delay was due to infrequent meetings, but a meeting was scheduled for this Thursday to resolve the issue. He stated that the 30,000 yuan relief fund had already been transferred to the Social Affairs Bureau for distribution. Later, the representatives went to the Social Affairs Bureau and met with Section Chief Zhang Chenghui of the Fourth Section. As Chief Zhang was on leave, a staff member replied that the funds could be distributed next week after Mr. Wang Binyan's official document arrived.</p>
<h3>Seamen's New Trend</h3>
<p>Seamen Oppose Registration</p>
<p>Shanghai seamen, due to the Ministry of Communications' promulgation of regulations for managing seamen, stipulating that all seamen from shipowners down, regardless of appointment, promotion, transfer, employment, or dismissal, must obtain a handbook from the Navigation Administration Bureau, paying a fee of two to five yuan each time, totaling nine items. The seamen unanimously opposed the registration fee. As a result, the Ministry agreed to cancel the registration fees for suspension and dismissal. The seamen believe that with seven types of registration fees still remaining, requiring fees for every action of seamen, which is unprecedented in other countries, merely canceling two types is not a thorough solution. They have submitted a second petition, collectively signed, demanding the fundamental abolition of this harsh regulation as soon as possible. The petition has been drafted and sent to both the Navigation Bureau and the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Marine Engineers Petition</h3>
<p>Since the tragic accident of the Da Yun ship last year and the New Affairs Zhao disaster this year, the Ministry of Communications has strictly regulated the personnel in the engine departments of various ships. Only those with nautical knowledge and experience, certified by the shipping company, are allowed to serve as officers in the engine department. Qualifications are limited, and the Ministry issues qualification certificates. The procedures for obtaining the certificate are cumbersome, requiring a medical examination and a review of qualifications by the Ministry. Each certificate costs more than fifty yuan and is valid for only five years. Currently, there are nearly one hundred certified marine engineers in Shanghai without current positions. Although the Ministry of Communications has instructed various shipping bureaus not to hire marine engineers without certificates, many merchants in Shanghai are employing marine engineers without certificates, causing qualified personnel to become unemployed, making the Ministry's certificate equivalent to waste paper. Yesterday, all unemployed marine engineers decided to petition Director Zhu of the Navigation Administration Bureau this morning, requesting him to handle the matter fairly.</p>
<h3>Water Rate Negotiations Still Unresolved</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Wan Bao reported that the rumors of a compromise solution to the public concession's water rate dispute are inaccurate. The recent meeting of the Housing Association, where it was announced that the water rate dispute had been resolved after recent negotiations, agreeing to pay 10% of the rent before the end of February and calculating according to the water meter thereafter, also deviates from the facts. According to what this newspaper (Da Mei Wan Bao) has learned today, the two sides have not yet reached a mutually satisfactory solution. Currently, the company only promises that if the water rate is extremely high according to the water meter, the water company may grant special concessions to the owners, roughly up to 10% of the rent. However, this 10% figure is only a discretionary standard for concessions, not a formal fixed rate. This concession plan is also subject to the circumstances of each household and will be granted separately, not uniformly applied. The negotiations between the owner's association representative, Feng Bingnan, and the representatives of the Public Works Department and the water company are still ongoing, and no concrete solution has yet been found.</p>
<h3>Hongzhen Ship Runs Aground, Causing Trouble</h3>
<p>Damaging Thai Ship and Customs Pontoon</p>
<p>The Hongzhen ship of the Sanbei Company, which travels between Yichang, Shashi, Hankou, and Shanghai, encountered shallow water and a heavy load on the morning of the 18th of this month when arriving at the Gu Matou near Shashi. The ship ran aground. The shipowner tried various methods, including reversing, but was unable to escape the shallows for a full day and night. Subsequently, the Shashi branch specially hired a large tugboat to tow the Hongzhen ship with great effort. However, the Hongzhen ship was deeply embedded in the sand. It was not until the river rose greatly on the afternoon of the 19th that the tugboat pulled it out of the shallows. Unfortunately, due to excessive force, the Hongzhen ship damaged the nearby Thai ship on both sides and then crashed into the Shashi Customs pontoon, damaging it. The extent of the damage is being investigated. The Hongzhen ship itself was not damaged.</p>
<h3>County Administration Meeting Record</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government held its 143rd county administration meeting yesterday, chaired by County Magistrate Yan. The matters discussed included: (1) The County Magistrate submitted a proposal to estimate the price of the houses near Panfang and the amount the county should receive from the property. Resolution: Negotiate with the city based on the estimated principles. (2) The County Magistrate submitted a proposal on how to handle the Finance Bureau's reply stating that it was impossible to increase the funding for the county Party headquarters. Resolution: The Finance Bureau will find a way to increase the current Party affairs funding by 100 yuan of temporary expenses for the 21st year to meet the needs. (3) The County Magistrate submitted a proposal, according to the Finance Bureau's request to allocate remaining land for the construction of granary dormitories. Resolution: After investigation, the area adjacent to the granary has been designated as a public sports field, and there is no land available for allocation. The request is rejected without further discussion.</p>
<h3>Jisheng Society</h3>
<p>Continued Remittance of Relief Funds for Guangfeng Embankment Project</p>
<p>The China Jisheng Society, currently undertaking the Guangfeng Embankment project in Nanchang, received a letter from the deputy director, Li Yunmen, who went to the project site with relief workers. Taking advantage of the low water levels before the spring rise, they are rushing to repair the embankment. The letter stated that the embankment project is progressing smoothly and requires a large amount of funding. The 10,000 yuan remittance from the Bank of China is about to be used up, and they requested another remittance for relief efforts. The Society yesterday entrusted the Bank of China to remit 15,000 yuan for the project. At this time of poverty and financial exhaustion, both national planning and people's livelihoods must be considered. It is hoped that patriotic comrades at home and abroad will contribute to its success.</p>
<h3>Indian Constable Murder Case Appeals</h3>
<p>British Assessor Opened Court Yesterday</p>
<p>The case of Indian constable You Sha, who worked as a lane guard in Lizhongli, stopping the tenant Hong Kaifa from moving and stabbing Zhou A'yu to death, was interrogated for the second time by British Assessor Greine last October. You Sha was sentenced to ten years imprisonment with hard labor. The defendant's lawyer, Ha Dupu, appealed to reduce the sentence. Yesterday, British Assessor Greine, together with Judges Campu and Jones, opened a court to hear the appeal. The grounds for the appeal were still that You Sha did not beat the deceased, but that the deceased attacked first, and You Sha acted in self-defense. Assessor Graine asked where the evidence of the deceased attacking first was. It was said that You Sha had stated this in his confession.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Public Security Bureau Strictly Prohibits Opium</h3>
<p>Two Opium Cases Cracked in Nanshi Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau recently received a tip that a large number of people specializing in opium were plotting to sell opium in Nanshi. Yesterday, a team was dispatched to surround and arrest them. As of 5:00 PM, two opium cases had been cracked. Large teams were dispatched again last night to search and arrest, and more discoveries are expected in the coming days. The details of the opium cases cracked yesterday are recorded below. Officers of the First Precinct of the Second District seized six opium offenders, Li Changsheng, Chen Ading, Ding Yaobo, Sheng Asan, Hu Renbao, and Jiang Ganren, along with evidence, from house number 4 in Fuqingli, Nanshi. They were taken to the precinct for interrogation. Li Changsheng confessed to smoking opium, and Chen Ading and the others confessed to the same. It was found that Li Changsheng confessed to smoking, and Chen Ading, Ding Yaobo, Sheng Asan, Hu Renbao, and Jiang Ganren were found in Li Changsheng's house, suspected of involvement. The confessions of the offenders should be copied and inspected, and they should be transferred to the court for interrogation. In addition, the First Squad of the Police Brigade, dispatched police to cooperate with the police in Maojianong, seized three offenders who smoked red pills, Tang Baohe, Zhao Pengfei, and Zhu Axiao, from the Yuanmao Printing House in Xianggua Street. They were taken to the brigade for interrogation. Tang Baohe confessed to smoking red pills, but Zhao Pengfei and Zhu Axiao denied smoking red pills. It was found that Tang Baohe confessed to smoking red pills, and Zhao Pengfei and Zhu Axiao were caught on the spot with witnesses. It is difficult to allow them to deny it. The case involves the prohibition of opium, and the confessions should be copied and inspected and sent to the court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Russian Overseas Chinese Suffers a Mental Breakdown</h3>
<p>Beats Shipowner on Ship</p>
<p>Russian engineer Selemidni F夫, 35 years old, boarded the Sanbei Shipping Company's Qingpu ship from Hankou to Shanghai with seven pieces of luggage, including suitcases. After the ship left the mooring in Hankou, the Russian suffered a mental breakdown and randomly attacked people. When the ship passed Nanjing and docked at the Xia Kai Pier, the shipowner informed the Russian Consulate in Nanjing of the situation and requested the Russian Consul to take measures, but the Russian Consul did not take him in. The ship arrived in Shanghai at 9:00 AM the day before yesterday. The platoon leader of the Central Military Police Corps, Li Jiashan, requested the head of the Municipal Public Security Bureau to order the Water Patrol Team to dispatch police to handle the matter. It is said that the Russian also beat the shipowner. Therefore, he was taken to the headquarters with a note. After interrogation, the Russian spoke incoherently and cried and laughed loudly. His luggage was found to be sealed by the Jiujiang Public Security Bureau. Upon opening, there were no prohibited items, only clothes and Russian banknotes: three one-yuan notes, two five-yuan notes, two ten-yuan notes, one five-yuan note from the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, and one two-jiao small note. Director Wen was afraid that releasing him would cause trouble, so he handed him over to the police brigade of the bureau for temporary custody. Yesterday, the Shanghai Russian Overseas Chinese Relief Association was notified to send someone to the bureau for consultation. It is said that the association has arranged to send him to the hospital for treatment and has notified the Russian's family in Hankou.</p>
<h3>Social Affairs Bureau</h3>
<p>Strict Order to Dissolve the Huxi Charity Group</p>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau believes that the Huxi Charity Group has not been registered, its content is corrupt, Cai's management is ineffective, and it is soliciting donations outside without restraint. The bureau previously sent a letter to the Public Security Bureau to forward to the Second Special District Court, summoning its负责人Xu Zixian to immediately issue a voluntary dissolution order. In January of this year, a merchant sent a 10 yuan remittance to the group for Hexiao Bridge and requested an investigation. The Social Affairs Bureau sent someone to secretly investigate the remittance and found that the group had indeed received it and issued a formal receipt. Therefore, it dissolves its name, receives donations in reality, defrauds money and violates laws. The bureau has listed four dissolution measures and strictly ordered them to be followed for dissolution, and also hopes that citizens will no longer be deceived and donate to the organization.</p>
<h3>YMCA</h3>
<p>Overview of War Zone Service Progress</p>
<p>Need Gramophones, Records and Films</p>
<p>The National Association of Chinese Christian Young Men's Associations of Shanghai has recently received a telegram from Ade Fu, the North China District Secretary, stating that he has begun service work on the front lines, establishing soldiers' entertainment rooms, education rooms, etc. In addition to the entire staff of the Beijing YMCA, Xu Xingji, Zhang Xiru, and Song Paolo are also participating in the service. After receiving the news, the Association immediately invested in six cage balls (20 yuan each) to send to the front lines. In addition, it plans to continue to organize gramophones, records, projectors, films, and slides to send to the front lines. Those from all walks of life who wish to donate, please send to the Youth Association at No. 20 Museum Road in this port. It is also reported that the acting general secretary of the Association, Mr. Liang Xiaochu, and the director of the School Association, Dr. Nan Bingfang, rushed to the north last Saturday to discuss issues related to the progress of war zone service with the military and political authorities and the local YMCA.</p>
<h3>Do not Publicize Lawsuits Concerning Morality</h3>
<p>Lawyers Association Notifies Attention</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association yesterday issued a notice to all members stating: "I would like to inform you that according to the proposal of Member Yan Yinwu, regarding civil and criminal litigation cases handled by various lawyers, they often arbitrarily decorate the content, regardless of whether it concerns social morality, and compile it into a legendary news story, or publish the original lawsuit verbatim on the newspaper. Social people use it as a chat, and people without knowledge take it as a fun influence on morality, which is huge. If this is not changed for a long time, the abuse will be unbearable. You should notify all lawyers that for civil and criminal litigation cases related to morality, you must not publish the original lawsuit or related documents in the newspapers, in order to save the degeneration." The first 11222323 joint meeting of the Board of Directors and Supervisors of this Association resolved that Member Yan's proposal is related to the world, people's hearts, and lawyers' ethics, and should be communicated to all members for information and compliance. "</p>
<h3>Turning Private Gain into Public Good</h3>
<p>Innovative Move to Donate to Aviation</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Zhenjia, the manager of Yufeng Company on Fuzhou Road in this port, ordered cuff laces at a certain Chinese bank in the morning. Later, due to the goods being out of shape, disputes arose, and both parties caused litigation. The Chinese bank knew that it was at fault, and immediately asked a friend to mediate. As a result, the Chinese bank compensated Mr. Hu of the company for more than 1,000 yuan for the loss. It is now reported that Mr. Hu Zhenjia, the manager of the bank, plans to allocate the money, except for litigation costs and other damages, still 500 yuan, to public welfare to show integrity. The money is currently donated by Mr. Shao Daren, who donated 300 yuan to the aviation donation, and transferred to the Ningbo Fellow Association, and by Mr. Zhang Zilian, who raised 200 yuan for the aviation donation, and transferred to the Aviation Association. Like Mr. Hu, he can be a person who takes money seriously and is righteous and courageous.</p>
<h3>Detailed Report on the Severe Disaster in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>The China Jisheng Association in this port has recently received a report from the Chang'an Branch in Shaanxi, transferred by Mr. Wang Jishi, the director of the shelter set up by the association in Wugong County, stating the details of the organization and the current situation in the disaster area. It was found that the Wugong shelter, since its opening on the 12th day of the first month of this year, first collected more than 200 people on the 3rd and 4th days, especially those who were extremely distressed. In the middle, there were frequent shortages, and many people in the cabinet. In January, a total of men and women disaster victims were collected, more than 500. Everyday, people came to the shelter to complain and ask for help, which is not recorded. It is difficult to save people universally. That is, the staff went to the mountains on February 3 to feed more than 140 people. Each disaster victim was given a set of white cloth and a dai mouth, with more than a liter of dry food stored, as needed along the way. On the 4th, another 150 disaster victims were sent, and staff were sent to be the front station to check the accommodation address for the disaster responsibility. Every day, according to the disaster victims' pace, they can only walk 40 or 50 miles, or they will not be able to handle it. Now, it is estimated that 600 to 700 people have gone to the mountains to eat because the price of grain in the mountains is slightly cheaper. The girls and children who cannot walk, about 200 people, will be kept in Wugong for adoption, and will be reconsidered after the wheat autumn. First, staff were sent to the Nanshan area to find a place where the price was relatively reduced, to transfer to eat. According to the letter, there are many people who have fled in Nanshan, which has led to rising grain prices. It is better to go to Gansu to punish the suspension, and its price is calculated in Wugong dou, each dou can be 50 or 60 jiao, which is three times less than Wugong. A shelter address has been set in Huixian, which is more than 600 miles from Wugong. Thinking that Hugong is currently not raining, the fields are red, the red sun is the sky, and the ash is shallow. Rather than waiting for death, it is better to eat and extend life. Now Wugong has collected more than 400 people, and is preparing to send them to Huixian for adoption. At this moment, the fields in Wugong have no Wangzhu, and they are used as firewood, which is very painful. Hungry bellies, day and night, are trying to find a plan. Everything is known. As for the situation of the guests in the shelter, some young people are so hungry that they are bone-thin, and children are in love with their relatives. They are fed in the shelter, and they are kind to their families. They are persuaded in every way, but they keep crying. They are allowed to see their parents. Their brother is dying because of his father. His heart is burning, and his brother is handling it. He is forcibly ordered to die. His family members stop him, send him to the temple at night, and send him home in the morning. He recounts the general situation of his parents' impending death, and sends him back to the shelter for custody. Please do not let him go. His father and brothers will also say goodbye forever. Such a situation is endless.

<h3>Li Minghui's Love Affair Case</h3>
<p>Murderer Wang Nengxiang Appeals</p>
<p>Wang Nengxiang Claims to Have Been in Guangzhou at the Time of the Incident</p>
<p>The Judge Believes This Point Needs Investigation</p>
<p>Miss Li Minghui, who gained fame for singing new songs, was in Hong Kong last spring. Due to a love triangle, her two lovers, Zheng Guoyou and Feng Deqian, suddenly turned from friends into enemies. Feng was murdered on the night of March 24th last year in the Shanguang Road area of Hong Kong by someone hired by Zheng. Afterward, the Hong Kong British Police Department arrested Zheng Guoyou and others, investigated the case, and sentenced them according to the law. They also notified the Shanghai Public Concession Police Department, stating that a murderer named Wang Nengxiang from Tongzhou (also known as Wang Renxiang) had fled to Shanghai by ship after the incident and requested assistance in apprehending him. Subsequently, the Chinese Detective Chief Lu Liankui discovered that the murderer...</p>
<h3>Chen Kaihong</h3>
<p>Attempted Murder of Parents</p>
<p>A Shocking Incident</p>
<p>The Elderly Father Luckily Survived</p>
<p>Around 10 PM the night before last, an elderly man was found collapsed outside the Dadongmen Gate in Shijia Alley, Nanshi. He had an extremely thick hemp rope around his neck and a knife wound on the back of his head, with fresh blood flowing from the wound, indicating a possible murder. The responsible police precinct was notified and sent officers to the scene. They found the elderly man lifeless, but his body was still warm. They untied the hemp rope around his neck, and the elderly man suddenly regained consciousness. He was rushed to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. According to him, his own son and daughter-in-law were plotting to kill him. The incident is truly shocking. Here are the details of the case:</p>
<h3>Chen's Family History</h3>
<p>Chen Qiao, a native of Yangzhou, is 58 years old. His wife, Ms. (surname), gave birth to two sons. The elder son, named Kaihong, is 33 years old and married to Yang (surname), who is 17 years old and from Baoying. The couple runs a pancake shop at No. 95, Jia Du, Pudong. The younger son, named Xiaogou, is 22 years old and works as a leather craftsman, residing at No. 42, Yangjiazhai, Pudong. Chen used to make a meager living vaccinating people in his hometown. However, with the development of hospitals in recent years, people prefer to go to hospitals for vaccinations. As a result, Chen had no one to consult and, being old, could no longer make a living. He had no choice but to come to Shanghai and live with Kaihong, relying on his son for support.</p>
<h3>Abandoned in the Courtyard</h3>
<p>However, his son Kaihong has a violent temper, and his daughter-in-law Yang (surname) is unkind. Seeing that Chen was not contributing to production and was living in their house, they became disgusted. Soon, they began to abuse him. In June of last year, Kaihong and his wife beat Chen severely over a minor matter. Still not satisfied, they stripped Chen naked, tied his hands and feet with rope, and abandoned him in the courtyard. At that time, Chen's back was exposed to the scorching sun, and soon his entire body blistered, causing excruciating pain. Fortunately, a passerby saw him and pleaded with Kaihong, who then released Chen. Afterward, Chen's back became severely ulcerated due to the heat, and it took a long time to heal.</p>
<h3>A Small Test with a Kitchen Knife</h3>
<p>Later, Kaihong went a step further and planned to murder Chen to free himself from the burden of having him in this world. One night, while Chen was fast asleep, Kaihong used a kitchen knife to strike Chen's head. Fortunately, Chen had already woken up and quickly covered his head with a quilt, avoiding a fatal blow. Chen cried out for help, but Kaihong, fearing that the neighbors would notice, did not continue the attack. Afterward, Chen was still afraid of incurring resentment from his son, so he endured it and did not publicize the matter. After a few days, Kaihong, seeing that the murder had failed, drove Chen out of the house. Chen then filed a complaint with the Shanghai District Court, accusing Kaihong of neglecting his duty to support him and of abusing him. However, he did not reveal the attempted murder. The case was heard once, and the court ruled that Kaihong should continue to provide support and pay him two jiao a day for living expenses.</p>
<h3>Tiptoeing to Strike</h3>
<p>Since Chen returned to his son's house, Kaihong became even more resentful. He would scold or beat Chen at the slightest offense. However, Chen, thinking of the father-son relationship, endured it silently. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, Kaihong and Yang secretly discussed murdering Chen again. Fortunately, Chen learned of the plan and, around 9 PM that evening, made an excuse to go out, crossing the river to Nanshi to discuss the matter with a friend. After Chen left, Kaihong feared that he knew their secret and would report it to the authorities. He immediately had the evil thought of going all the way. He immediately gathered his younger brother Xiaogou and his wife Yang, hiding a thick hemp rope and a sharp knife, and followed Chen to Nanshi. Waiting until he walked to a secluded place, they struck. Chen did not realize that his own son, whom he had raised, was following him, intending to take his life.</p>
<h3>Tightly Pulling the Rope</h3>
<p>Before long, Chen reached Shijia Alley, a secluded place. Kaihong and the others rushed forward. First, they struck the back of his head with a sharp knife. Chen cried out in pain. Before the cry finished, Kaihong and the others put a hemp rope around his head and pulled it tightly. Chen did not see who was attacking him. However, he heard his daughter-in-law Yang shouting, "Hurry up and pull!" Soon, Chen could not breathe and could not move his hands and feet. Seeing this, Kaihong and the others knew that they had achieved their goal and abandoned him on the roadside. They then crossed the river and returned home. Afterward, someone discovered an elderly man murdered in Shijia Alley and immediately reported it to the police precinct, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Regaining Consciousness</h3>
<p>After receiving the report, Chief Yi, recognizing the seriousness of the matter, immediately ordered Police Chief Lan Yucheng to rush to Shijia Alley. They found that Chen was lifeless, but his body was still warm. They quickly untied the hemp rope around his neck and administered artificial respiration. Before long, Chen suddenly regained consciousness, moving his hands and feet. The police chief knew he could be saved and rushed him to Shanghai Hospital. Chen then tearfully recounted the events to the police chief. The police chief, amazed that such a thing could happen, took him to the precinct. The chief interrogated him. The next day, around 8 AM, he sent officers to Pudong to arrest Kaihong, Xiaogou, and Yang. During the interrogation, Kaihong and the others, realizing that their crime had been discovered unexpectedly, were terrified. However, they denied everything. They were detained temporarily. The police were sent to Pudong to investigate their neighbors. According to the neighbors, Kaihong and the others had always been disreputable. Yang was also a well-known harlot. When she worked in a factory, she had an affair with a worker. When she was 15 years old, she secretly gave birth to a child. The police reported this to Chief Yi, stating that Chen Kaihong and the others were extremely unfilial and dared to murder their parents, committing extreme lawlessness. He immediately ordered a written report to be submitted to the Municipal Public Security Bureau at around 4 PM that afternoon for strict investigation. At around 11 AM yesterday morning, Chen, who had not eaten anything all morning, felt hungry. He spent money to buy three pancakes. Just as he was about to eat, he saw his son Kaihong and the others detained in the detention center. Knowing that it was noon and they would not have lunch, he endured his hunger and sent the three pancakes to the detention center, asking his son and daughter-in-law to share them. However, Kaihong and the others shook their heads in refusal. Despite his repeated urging, they still refused to accept. He was overcome with grief, and tears welled up in his eyes. He could not swallow the pancakes he had bought, so he threw them away. Ah, the love of a calf-licking mother, how deep it is! What should those who are sons feel upon reading this article?</p>
<p>After arriving in Shanghai, he hid at No. 71 Xuxie Branch Road, Nanshi. He was apprehended and handed over to the First Special District Court. After repeated negotiations with British officials in Hong Kong, it was decided that the case would be handled here. Subsequently, several court hearings were held. Finally, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. The details have been recorded in previous reports. However, after receiving the sentence, Wang Nengxiang expressed dissatisfaction and submitted a petition to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, requesting an appeal. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yu of the Criminal Division, along with Assessors Zhao and Jiang, specially convened a joint court to hear the case. However, the witness Li Minghui was reportedly out of Shanghai due to other affairs and would not return until a week later. Therefore, she did not appear in court yesterday. Judge Yu ordered Wang Nengxiang to be brought to the court and asked about the reasons for his appeal. Wang claimed that the court had not provided conclusive evidence of his murder charge and that he was not convinced. He requested that Xu Rongsheng, an accomplice in the case in Hong Kong, be transferred to the court for confrontation, stating that only then would he be satisfied. Judge Yu stated that Xu Rongsheng and the others had already been questioned in detail by the Hong Kong authorities, and their statements had been copied and sent to the first instance court, so there was no need to transfer them again. He rejected Wang Nengxiang's request and continued to ask about other reasons. Wang claimed, "I went to Guangzhou on the tenth day of the second lunar month last year and left Guangdong for Hong Kong on the second day of the third lunar month. The incident happened on March 24th of the Gregorian calendar. At that time, I was still in Guangzhou. Huang Shaotang can prove this. Huang works as a carpenter at the Dadong Gramophone Company on Taiping North Road outside Guangzhou City. When I was in Guangdong, I stayed with Huang every day, so Huang certainly knows my whereabouts. This should be investigated." The court believed that this point should be investigated and ordered a re-examination. Wang Nengxiang was taken back to the police station for detention.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Rape Case</h3>
<p>Two Robbers Sentenced to Death</p>
<p>Dissatisfied with Initial Life Sentences</p>
<p>Appeals Result in Death Sentences</p>
<p>Zhao Wenbao, 27 years old, and Dong Yonghong, 25 years old, both from Gaoyou, Jiangbei, were found to have gathered accomplices and used weapons to rob Liang Xuefu, a fellow villager living in an unnumbered flat in Yangshupu Road, of property worth 211 yuan on the morning of November 23rd last year, and to have taken turns raping his 19-year-old sister Liang Xiaomei (also known as Zhou Xiaomei). The case was discovered, and the two were arrested by Chinese and foreign detectives from the Yulin Road police station and handed over to the First Special District Court, where they were each sentenced to life imprisonment. Zhao and Dong were dissatisfied and appealed. Judge Yu of the Second Branch High Court believed that the two had committed heinous crimes and changed the sentences to death, which were submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval and ordered to be carried out. At 2 PM yesterday afternoon, Execution Judge Shen Shanzeng arrived at the Third Criminal Court and ordered Zhao and Dong to be brought in for questioning about their age, origin, whether they had any last words, and to contact their families. Zhao Wenbao still claimed that he was innocent and asked his father, Zhao Zifeng, to come and collect his body. His address was a shed without a number on Yanshan Road, Yangshupu. Dong Yonghong stated that his home was at No. 34, Songmaoli, Songpan Road, his father's name was Dong Shoupeng, and he asked to be notified to collect his body. He also had two silver yuan and eight copper coins, which he asked to be handed over to him. He also claimed that he had been having an affair with Zhou Xiaomei when she was working at the Dakang Cotton Mill. Judge Shen declared that the day for execution had arrived and there was no need to say more. He ordered them to be sent to the District Court for execution. The Chinese and foreign police took the two criminals down, along with the case files and photographs, and escorted them in a car to the execution ground at the Second Prison in Caohejing. The prosecutor commissioned by the court arrived at the scene, verified the identities of the two criminals, ordered the bailiffs to bind them according to the law, and executed them by firing squad.</p>
<h3>Generous Guests Turn into Violent Robbers</h3>
<p>Robbery in Cian Lane</p>
<p>Staff of the Maoye Factory Beaten and Injured</p>
<p>Qian Jiachen Also Bound and Imprisoned in the Storeroom</p>
<p>Cian Lane on Ningbo Road is located behind the Xinxin Company on Nanjing Road. The area is densely populated and quite lively. The six buildings in the lane are all high-end commercial establishments. The Maoye Woolen Factory also has a distribution office at No. 2 in the lane, with Qian Jiachen's residence with his mistress upstairs. At 7 PM the night before last, a young man dressed in luxurious clothing entered the Maoye accounting room under the pretense of asking for the owner. Without saying a word, the factory staff mistakenly thought he was a generous guest and invited him to sit down. Then, the so-called handsome young man suddenly pulled out a pistol and pointed it at the accountant's chest, ordering him to hand over the keys. At the same time, five other men, all dressed in fashionable clothing and also carrying pistols, entered and warned them not to make a sound. They used the lead wires they had brought to tie up all thirteen Maoye staff members and push them into the storeroom. They began searching, but because no one was in charge of Maoye, they could not find the key to the safe. They beat the staff members and searched their pockets, obtaining over one hundred yuan. The robbers' courage did not falter, and they were still dissatisfied. They then rushed upstairs to Qian Jiachen's residence. Qian's room was richly decorated, but there were no readily available diamonds and jewelry. They also tied up Qian and his wife with lead wires and dragged them into the storeroom downstairs. They ransacked the boxes and chests, taking whatever they pleased. In the end, because it was inconvenient to carry, they only took several dozen yuan in cash and three pieces of beautiful qipao fabric. After things quieted down, the factory staff dared to break out of the storeroom. The distance from the police station was only a stone's throw away, yet the robbers dared to rob in broad daylight and at their leisure. The robbers' audacity was truly great. It is now heard that the residents of the lane, Shi Jiqun, Huang Yuzhai, and Chen Cunren, etc., to prevent future incidents, have already written to the Tonghe property management office to request additional armed patrol officers, and have also sent an official letter to the police department, requesting that they conduct a thorough investigation to maintain the security of the lane.</p>
<h3>Murder of Husband by Adulterous Wife</h3>
<p>Wife Flees, Lover Arrested</p>
<p>Son Kidnapped to Shanghai</p>
<p>Child Welfare Society Provides Shelter and Relief</p>
<p>The China Child Welfare Association at No. 20, Museum Road, received an orphan named Hu Jusheng, 9 years old, yesterday from the Municipal Public Security Bureau. It was learned that the child's home was in Dongfenglin, Changzhou. His father, named Ageng, made a living by farming. His mother, Zhang (surname), was unfaithful and had an affair with a local man. Their passion was extreme. Because her husband was watching her, she held a grudge in her heart. One night in June last year, Ageng was relaxing at the door, lying on a bench, when he suddenly fell asleep. The adulterous wife had the sudden intention to kill, and invited her lover to the kitchen to take a kitchen knife. While Ageng was asleep, she used the knife to slash his throat. The lover also helped to commit the crime. Instantly, blood splattered everywhere, and Ageng died tragically. They buried the body and destroyed the evidence in the middle of the night. However, they were spotted by a neighbor. The adulterous wife and lover, knowing that they could not escape punishment, set fire to the house and fled separately. It is heard that the lover was arrested and punished according to the law. Zhang (surname) disappeared without a trace, abandoning her nine-year-old child, who lost his support. He was kidnapped to Shanghai, where he was discovered by the Public Security Bureau and sent to the Child Welfare Society for shelter and education.</p>

During the banquet, Mr. Shao spoke at length about the situation in Gansu Province. The guests and hosts parted in joy at 11 PM.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping Robbers Daring to Impersonate Detectives</h3>
<p>Even Inquiring About News at the Robbed Store</p>
<p>Huang Tianbo, a 31-year-old Anhui native residing at No. 12 Hefeng Lane, Roberts Road, Shanghai West, was formerly a factory worker. Recently unemployed and idle, he colluded with robbers. On the evening of the 22nd of last month, at 10 PM, he and five other accomplices at large, including Zhang Chengyou and Zhang Yuede, armed with weapons, broke into the Hengyuan cigarette and paper shop owned by Wu Youliang at No. 396 Malan Road in the French Concession, stealing tens of dollars in various currencies before fleeing. The victim reported the incident to the police station, requesting an investigation. Unexpectedly, on the 9th of this month, Huang pretended to be a detective dispatched by the police station to inquire at the victim's shop whether a robbery had occurred and the amount of silver dollars stolen. Shop assistant Mao Genxiang recognized Huang's face, immediately recalling that Huang was the thief who had been keeping watch outside the door during the robbery. Mao then followed Huang to the Ximen Road intersection, where he alerted the police, who arrested Huang and brought him to the police station. During interrogation by the police chief, Huang, due to grudges with his housemate Tao Rongquan, a Jiangbei native, and Wang Laosi, also a Jiangbei native residing at No. 18 in the same lane, implicated Tao and Wang as accomplices in the robbery. Subsequently, a detective arrested Tao and Wang for questioning. Tao and others were completely clueless. Upon further interrogation, Huang confessed to falsely accusing them out of spite. After investigation by detectives, he was escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division yesterday. Judge Wang Gangxu conducted the trial. First, the police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang presented the case, stating that the police were prosecuting the first defendant under Articles 348 and 180 of the Criminal Code for robbery by a gang of three or more and false accusation. The second and third defendants were not being prosecuted. Witness Mao Genxiang testified that he saw Huang keeping watch outside during the robbery and later coming to investigate, so he followed him and alerted the police to arrest him. Huang Tianbo confessed that he went to rob with Zhang Chengyou, Zhang Yuede, and others, and was given five dollars afterwards. Initially, they told me to watch for the police while they went to get water. I didn't know they were robbing, so I went to the shop to inquire, intending to be arrested, Zhang and others against Tao and Wang</p>

<p>The people are indeed falsely accused out of spite and did not go to rob together. Tao Rongquan testified that he used to work with Huang. He accused me of being a thief because I refused to give him clothing material, which caused him to harbor a grudge. Wang testified that he beat Huang because Huang harassed his widowed sister-in-law, causing him to harbor resentment and falsely accuse me of being a thief. I knew nothing about the robbery. The court, after verifying the testimonies, appointed a lawyer to defend Huang and then announced the end of the debate, scheduling the verdict for the 28th. The defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Foreman Assault Case Opens</p>
<p>Postponed for Retrial</p>
<p>Zhang Desheng, a 44-year-old Shandong native and foreman of the curing department of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company at No. 269 Broadway Road, was known for his violent nature. Recently, he made unreasonable demands to the factory for a wage increase, and at 9:45 AM the previous morning, he gathered dozens of idlers, armed with tobacco knives, iron bars, and other weapons, and stormed into the tin packaging department on the third floor, wantonly destroying property and violently beating the department's staff members, Li Zhitang and Li Yongyao, who were seriously injured. At that time, carpenter Chen Ronggui stepped forward to stop them and was also injured. After someone reported to the Huishan Police Station, the police chief immediately dispatched Chinese Detective Zhang Ziqing, along with Chinese and foreign detectives, to apprehend them. They found Li and Chen Ronggui covered in blood, lying on the floor, unable to speak. They were taken by ambulance to the Baek Road Baolong and Haining Road Red Cross hospitals for treatment. Subsequently, Chinese and foreign detectives arrested Zhang Desheng, the leader of the assault, and took him into custody. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that the victims, Li Zhitang, Li Yongyao, and Chen Ronggui, sustained serious injuries to their heads, chests, legs, and other parts of their bodies and were unable to attend the court. Witness Feng Haiquan from the company could identify everything. He requested a postponement of the trial. Lawyer Wu Linkun from the Nanyang Company attended the court to await instructions. Feng Haiquan testified that he was the director of the tin packaging department on the third floor of the company. The defendant was the foreman of the tobacco leaf room downstairs. At the time, he personally saw the suspect wielding a tobacco knife, smashing the doors and windows, and rushing in first, followed by fifty to sixty thugs, shouting to start the assault, saying that he would be responsible if anyone was killed. He then abandoned the knife and took an iron bar, repeatedly striking the two Li staff members to the ground and throwing teapots at them. Only then did carpenter Chen Ronggui step in to mediate and was also beaten down. When questioned, the defendant Zhang Desheng gave evasive answers. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered that he be remanded in custody for a retrial.</p>

<h3>Reader Advisory</h3>
<p>The Storm Aroused By Reading</p>
<p>A Message from Zhao Yongcheng from Our City</p>
<p>My home is located in a remote village surrounded by countless mountains. In that village, all feudal forces and old ethics are still fully preserved. In such a harsh environment, my younger sister was betrothed to the son of a local gentry by her parents through the words of a matchmaker when she was only six or seven years old. In the spring of 1920, the other party requested marriage. At this time, my younger sister was only sixteen years old and studying in the fifth grade of elementary school. Her fiancé was seventeen years old and also in the fifth grade of elementary school. Because both parties were too young, my family strongly opposed it. However, the other party's parents were too stubborn and repeatedly insisted, insisting on an immediate marriage. My family also insisted on opposing. Later, the other party said that the marriage was only a formality and that my younger sister would be allowed to continue her studies at home after the marriage. My parents were forced to compromise. However, my younger sister refused to comply and almost committed suicide. But how could a girl of only a dozen years old resist? In the end, she was forced to submit. Initially, the other party also agreed to allow my younger sister to return home to study. However, last spring, after my younger sister graduated from elementary school, she was determined to continue her studies in middle school. She sought the other party's opinion, but the other party absolutely opposed it, citing the inability to provide financial support. We repeatedly explained various reasons to the other party's parents, stating that we did not need any financial support and only asked for their permission. However, the other party remained stubborn and refused. My younger sister's desire to study was very strong and she was unwilling to submit. With no other choice, my younger sister and I resolutely decided to go to the provincial capital to take the entrance examination for the provincial girls' middle school. After being admitted, she enrolled in the school. A semester passed without incident. However, this spring, the other party demanded a divorce without giving any reason. In the past, both parties were very harmonious, with only some differences on the issue of education. My younger sister came to the province purely for the sake of studying and had absolutely no other intentions. She has also absolutely maintained the personality that girls should maintain in school. Now the other party suddenly demands a divorce. I respectfully request your guidance on how to resolve this problem and ask you to answer the following questions: (One)</p>
<p>The feelings between the couple have completely disappeared. If she does not divorce, my younger sister will inevitably be subjected to abuse. If peaceful methods cannot achieve harmony, what should we do to ensure my younger sister's future happiness? (Two) Based on the above facts, whose reasons are more sufficient in the eyes of the law? (Three) If the other party forces a divorce, how should we respond? Can we demand considerable compensation for youth and alimony after the divorce? What conditions and restrictions are there in the law? I respectfully await your reply.</p>
<p>Answer: According to your letter, your younger sister's differences with her husband's family are only due to the issue of education. Since the husband's family wants a divorce, if it is determined that they cannot live together for life, it is a good thing to take this opportunity to divorce. This is one thing. The reporter is not a legal expert. I dare not answer the second question hastily. But judging from reason and logic, if your younger sister is as you stated in your letter and there is nothing else that harms her character, then naturally the fault lies with the husband's family and not with your younger sister. Her reasons should be sufficient. This is two things. According to common sense, if the first party proposes a divorce, they must bear considerable alimony or compensation for loss of status to the second party; the same applies if the second party proposes a divorce to the first party. As for the specific legal provisions, there are lawyers to consult.</p>

<h3>Worrying for (Humor)</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>George Bernard Shaw's English pronunciation is Burner Shaw. If translated as (Baonai Xiao, 包倷笑, literally "guaranteed to make you laugh"), his humorous nature could be expressed through his name.</p>
<p>Ever since the old man (Baonai Xiao) came to Shanghai, then to Beiping, and then to Tokyo, the term humor has become almost universally known. However, I fear this is not to the benefit of humor! I am quite worried about the future of humor. Why am I worried about humor? Let me give you two reasons:</p>
<p>First, people in society who do not seek to understand thoroughly often interpret words literally and force themselves to understand things. In the past, the term (Romantic) was misunderstood as (having affairs), (stealing wives), (being promiscuous), (gambling wildly), and various other interpretations. Recently, (Modern) and (Model) have been forcibly interpreted as coquettish women and girls without pants. Following this pattern, the word humor, as it spreads in society, will certainly lose its true meaning. In the future, perhaps even now, some people will be discussing this word humor, saying, (Humor is the act of sitting silently in the dark.) Or, they might say, (Humor is a homophone of oiling/smearing.) From then on, misinformation will spread, and what will humor become? This is one aspect of my worry, worrying for the sake of humor itself.</p>
<p>Second, in our country, which is in a modern era of absolute freedom of speech? , does this environment allow us to imitate (Baonai Xiao) and his ilk and speak out boldly? The facts tell me that there have been quite a few people who have imitated that humorous (Baonai Xiao), and the result has only been (meeting their anger). While they were indulging in self-appreciation of humor, they were given a (Maybe it is humorous, 莫須幽) (Note) crime. When they were humorously (inviting the king into the urn 请君入瓮), wasn't laughing and crying both crimes, and humor was no longer humor? This is another aspect of my worry, worrying for the sake of those who imitate the old man of humor (Baonai Xiao).</p>
<p>(Note) "Maybe it is humorous" (莫須幽) is a homophone of "Maybe it is there" (莫须有), a term meaning "fabricated accusation."</p>
<h3>□□□□</h3>
<p>— A Wise Man</p>
<p>Selling Secrets</p>
<p>"□□□□" these few square blocks, are saying, because of the clash of Yin and Shen, the conflict of Chen and Xu, in the Republic of China year 22, it is due to have good luck in the annual cycle.</p>
<p>Square blocks, in small-scale newspapers in the mainland, are commonplace and not surprising. For example, if there is a familiar but unfamiliar character, the typesetting room happens not to have this lead type, so they frankly and without ceremony, ask the square block to act as the plenipotentiary representative.</p>
<p>In several large-scale newspapers in Shanghai, they sometimes play this game too. But under the square block, there is often a bracket attached, with the words "(telegraph code unknown)" in the middle, indicating that this is a helpless situation and does not require the reader's forgiveness.</p>
<p>But these days in the newspapers, the square blocks that are having good luck in their annual cycle, are neither due to a lack of lead type, nor due to an unknown telegraph code. Speaking of it, the source is big, but it was the Japanese who taught us this trick.</p>
<p>The fact is this: When the Songhu Anti-Japanese War broke out, Chinese newspapers very faithfully reported that a certain army was in a certain place, and a certain headquarters was in a certain direction. Damn it, no sooner had the newspaper been published than Japanese planes, as if they had eyes, flew to that certain place and certain direction to drop bombs.</p>
<p>At first, everyone didn't understand and only thought that the Japanese spies were very capable and had obtained the secrets. Later, a Japanese traitor said that with such news reporting, the Japanese army simply didn't need spies. They could just read the Chinese newspapers and follow the map, which was a great pleasure.</p>
<p>After suffering one loss, we learn one lesson, so these days, in the telegrams about the front-line war news, several square blocks are inserted, so that when the enemy sees them, although the dwarves have many lumps in their stomachs, they can't accurately guess what medicine is being sold in the gourd. What secrets are being sold in those square blocks?</p>
<p>On the first day of the month, the   brigade, captured   , killing   thousand enemies, seizing   countless, and is now advancing towards   , expected to reach   on the   day, and can directly attack   on the   day.) Don't worry everyone, this is a Futurist reporter selling secrets.</p>
<h3>From Aviation Sports to the Story of America</h3>
<p>— Yun Lian</p>
<p>Worthy of Emulation</p>
<p>Shanghai, a large international trading port, after nearly a month of city-wide mobilization, after nearly a month of city-wide slogan shouting and propaganda for the cause of national salvation through aviation: according to newspaper reports, only a paltry sum of over ten thousand yuan was raised, of which ten thousand yuan was donated solely by the owner of Tianchu MSG Factory; this clearly tells the enemy that the city of Shanghai, which has the largest population in the country, and is known as the elite people standing on the forefront of the times, has only this much patriotic sentiment! A friend surnamed Li, when the European War broke out, was living in New York City. The United States was neither an Allied nor an Entente country; they only felt the tragedy of war! With the instinct of a love for peace and human mutual assistance, he convened a joint meeting of all public organizations in the city in one day to discuss organizing a battlefield work, such as a rescue team. He immediately asked: For example, for a part of the hospital, how much funding do you need in total? How much can you raise yourself? As a result, it was estimated that five million gold was needed. Over three days, the committee produced by the joint meeting investigated the annual profits of all the shops in the city clearly, and stipulated 10/50 of the profits to donate to this funding; after proper distribution, the joint meeting issued a notice that at 12 noon on a certain day, members of the association would knock on the doors and windows of your esteemed office with a form, and ask your executives to hand over the donation that should be paid to the person who comes; and then without delay, this surprising huge amount of donation was declared to be more than adequate.</p>
<p>An elderly merchant living with Mr. Li, who was a middle-class wealthy man, had already made a donation for another public cause because of his business profits, and according to the rules, he did not need to pay again; the old merchant was surprised that the joint meeting did not send anyone to collect the money, thinking that he had lost face, so he personally went to the joint meeting to ask, saying: "Doesn't my age qualify me as a citizen? Am I not qualified to love my country?" After the people in the association explained in detail, the old merchant returned home sullenly.</p>
<p>This story is a real event in New York City, not a fabricated tale! Compatriots, is our society so healthy? Should we emulate it? Or should we continue with the empty talk of national salvation through aviation?</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>Fourth Battalion Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 2: The Humble Abode Makes Friendly Neighbors, Secretly Admiring the Healthy Old Man, The Wealthy Family Chooses a Good Match, Scornfully Criticizing the Poor Girl</p>
<p>Old Zhao smiled and clasped his hands several times, saying, "I dare not accept this. I dare not accept this!" Mrs. Jiang smiled and said, "This is naturally a joke, how dare we be so presumptuous? In my humble opinion: it would be much easier if your battalion commander got married earlier. Having a young mistress at home is much better than having a daughter." Old Zhao said, "You are right, and that's why I let Ziqiang pick me up to live here. Alas, but when it comes to marrying a daughter-in-law, it is very difficult." As he spoke, he stroked his beard in a pensive manner. When people talk about betrothing girls and marrying daughters-in-law, the girl has no way to interrupt, so Guizhi only held a handful of melon seeds in her hands, chewing on them on the side, without speaking. Mrs. Jiang then asked, "I heard that the old man is from Baoding, is he in the city or in the countryside?" Old Zhao said, "We still have land to grow crops. The whole family lives in the countryside." Mrs. Jiang said, "There are probably many people in your family, right?" Old Zhao said, "There were three of us brothers, but now there is only one left. The younger generation is quite numerous, but they have all separated." Mrs. Jiang said, "How much land does your family have?" Old Zhao said, "Enough to eat and drink, about a hundred mu of land." At this point, Mrs. Jiang turned to Guizhi and said, "Listen, their family has a hundred mu of land." She then turned back to Old Zhao and said, "With so few people in your family, thirty or forty mu of land would be enough to live a good life. A hundred mu of land is more than enough." Guizhi finished eating all the melon seeds in her hand, picked up a cup of tea on the coffee table, and drank it. After finishing the tea, she hesitated for a while, put down the cup, and said to her mother, "Let's go back and hurry up with that dress. If we don't finish it by twelve o'clock, they will come to urge us again." Seeing her daughter's brows furrowed, perhaps because her daughter was unwilling to do this, Mrs. Jiang had no choice but to stand up and say goodbye to Old Zhao, smiling, "I've disturbed you again. Our house is dark and dirty, and I dare not invite the old man to come over and sit down. If the old man needs anything, just go over there to get it. We are all good neighbors." Old Zhao smiled and said, "My son and I have straightforward tempers. You don't see me being polite when I speak." Mrs. Jiang repeatedly said yes and returned home happily. (19)</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on Reading Newspapers</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>Please Learn from Bu Shi's Patriotism</p>
<p>As usual, I read the newspaper every day, and glean some news about the northern war from under the big headlines. Perhaps I have not yet lost my sense of national identity, and I carefully savor the reports of our army's great victories with excited feelings. At this time, I simply laughed in my heart, ("Good fellows, a big saber waving towards the enemy's阵营, short Japanese guys fell down like shadows, satisfying! Is their army so useless!") I thought. So I opened my mouth, gesturing to people how to kill the enemy, and loudly praised the bravery of Song Zheyuan, Sun Dianying, and their subordinates. So I took out silver dollars and immediately sent them to the Volunteer Army Support Association to fulfill my personal responsibility as a commoner, and also to express my admiration. Whether we can (defend the Great Wall to the death) in the future, cannot be predicted now.</p>
<p>If you say that I took out the money, the purpose is to buy their glorious death, I am not a complete capitalist, I have not thought of this level. But those who harbor this kind of thought, in my opinion, are not necessarily non-existent. For example, after the news of Tang Yulin's abandonment of Chengde spread, some patriotic people who originally wanted to take out some money, refused to donate money to save the country at this time. ("Rehe has been lost, why donate money? To let the warlords deposit it in foreign banks!") They shouted in unison like this. Obviously, the reason why they donate money is to take the fact of victory as the price. Once disappointed, they think that the matter is over, and there is no need to use money anymore. They don't even need to save the country. But they have not thought that there are still soldiers resisting the Japanese in front of them, and there are still many national heroes going to the front line one after another. The rich who are unwilling to donate money because they are indignant at Tang Yulin's abandonment of his post and loss of land are mistaken. Even if Japanese soldiers have invaded the customs, and the government still says emptily (long-term resistance), but in fact takes no action; we should still save the country, those with strength should use their strength, those with talent should use their talent, and those with money should use their money. This meaning, even I know, carries a bit of nationalism, and is also close to shallow and ancient sayings, but in the current China, the way for the people to seek salvation on their own, it is still better to learn from Bu Shi of the Han Dynasty. As for the military in the front using knives to kill the enemy, it is a manifestation of strength: at the same time, it is also a manifestation of talent. Shouldn't we who are living in the rear stand idly by and watch? Can we save the country?</p>
<p>Biographical Sketches</p>
<h3>Anecdotes of Weng Zhaoyuan</h3>
<p>— Dingming</p>
<p>General Weng Zhaoyuan, who shook the East, all the women and children in the country can tell about his merits of defending Wusong for more than a month. Even those who have visited the battle sites, wandering around Paotai Bay and the Wenzaobang area, can't help but exclaim at General Weng's defense in the undefendable and his victory in the unachievable; however, there was a period of General Weng's life that was mostly overlooked by the world!</p>
<p>The fact is this: One day, I was working for the league, and suddenly found a package of things from August 16, 1930 in a pile of old papers. When I opened it, I was about to replace it with a new Shen Bao paper. Inadvertently, I saw a three-character headline: A Chinese student in France escapes danger and survives:) I suddenly thought that in the recent practice period of our country's flight comrades, I have repeatedly seen news of accidents; even foreign pilots have had facts of landing and dying. At the same time, I still inadvertently looked at two lines of small headlines: (Fell from five hundred meters with only minor injuries, the French press cites him as a brave Chinese.) My mood suddenly became tense after seeing it; these two headlines seemed to be spells that sucked me in, so I carefully read on:</p>
<p>(Paris Correspondence: Our student Weng Zhaoyuan (i.e. Weng Huiteng) graduated from the Japanese Army Academy last year, and then went to France to enter the Mo Guan Flying School, and has graduated from the second phase. Yesterday, when flying at five hundred meters, the engine suddenly failed, causing the fuselage to fall, breaking three high-voltage power lines, and the entire plane crashed. Weng was immediately sent to the Versailles Hospital by the army ambulance. Fortunately, the injuries were still minor, and he will be discharged from the hospital in a few days. This time, the plane fell from five hundred meters and broke the high-voltage power lines without being burned, which is also a strange thing. The French Aviation Department once sent people to study the cause of the fire. The French newspapers competed to say that it was lucky that he did not die. And praised him as a brave Chinese.)</p>
<p>(Oh! Weng, the brigade commander of the 156th Brigade, had such an anecdote!) After reading it, I felt this sentence from the bottom of my heart; and I got three feelings:</p>
<p>1. It is true that Weng had a strange experience to fall from five hundred meters and break the high-voltage power lines without being burned; and it seems that God deliberately teased him, leaving him to show his edge in the January 28th incident; but from the January 28th Weng took risks, and our army did not complete the work, it can also be seen (When Heaven is about to place a great responsibility on a man, it always first tests his resolution; exhausts his muscles and bones; frustrates his endeavors; and derails his undertakings, so that his mind is stimulated, his nature strengthened, and his abilities increased.) Mencius's words are absolutely correct! And poor boys should more resolutely harden their scalps and work hard, try!</p>
<p>2. The French newspapers competed to say that it was lucky that General Weng did not die, and praised him as a brave Chinese; then the Chinese people are inherently brave, and can be brave; the ancients said: (Heaven helps those who help themselves,) Oh, our Chinese people! Get up quickly! Get up quickly! Quickly be brave! Join the battle group, regard marching as child's play; regard airplanes and cannons as dragonflies flying and mantises waving their arms; regard the enemy army as poisonous bees, as bad guys, as evil horses, bravely cut them down, destroy them, and punish them, and permanently remove this thief for mankind! Now the athletes who join the flying world should be like General Weng, soaring in the sky, not afraid of dangers, forging flying skills, and promoting the spirit of fearlessness.</p>
<p>3. General Weng recently telegraphed on Yangri (7th) in Beiping to take over as the commander of the 117th Division. There are inspiring words in the text:</p>
<p>(Wrapped in horsehide, I have long cherished the heart of Fu Bo,</p>
<p>Burying bones in the sandy battlefield, I have long accumulated the ambition of Dingyuan.)</p>
<p>Seeing that (rectifying the army, inspiring the ten auras, driving out the jackals and tigers, and returning my rivers and mountains) is in front of us, this is the task of the Weng family. However, I especially hope that armed comrades with real strength will work together with one heart, unite, point their guns outward, sweep away the evil atmosphere, push away the haze; restore the glory of Changbai Mountain and Heilongjiang, and restore my glorious world.</p>

Many ladies are also enthusiastic about participating. It is heard that the association intends to hold separate groups to facilitate teaching, so that those who are interested, regardless of gender, can have equal opportunities to participate.

<h3>"Where Light Arrives..."</h3>
<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>Torture in Chinese prisons is an open secret. Last month, the China League for Civil Rights brought up this issue.</p>
<p>But the foreign-run (North-China Daily News) published a (Beijing Dispatch) on February 15, detailing that Dr. Hu Shih had personally visited several prisons and (very affectionately) told this reporter that (according to his careful investigation, he could not obtain the slightest evidence that they could easily talk to the prisoners. Once, Dr. Hu Shih was even able to converse with them in English. The prison conditions, he (Dr. Hu Shih - Jiagan's note) said, were not satisfactory, but although they freely (oh, very freely! - Jiagan's note) complained about the poor treatment and insults, they did not even hint at torture.)</p>
<p>Although I did not have the honor of following this (careful investigation), I visited the Beijing Model Prison ten years ago. Although it was a model prison, visiting prisoners and talking was not very (free). There was a window in between, about three feet apart. A guard stood next to me, the time was limited, and talking in code was not allowed, let alone in a foreign language.</p>
<p>But this time, Dr. Hu Shih was (able to converse with them in English,) which is extremely special. Could it be that Chinese prisons have been improved to this extent, (free) to this extent? Or was the guard intimidated by (English), thinking that Dr. Hu Shih was a fellow countryman of Lord Lytton and had a great background?</p>
<p>Fortunately, I saw Dr. Hu Shih's inscription on the (China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Three Major Cases)!</p>
<p>(Public exposure is the only weapon to overthrow dark politics. Where light arrives, darkness disappears.) (There were no modern punctuation marks originally; I added these presumptuously - Jiagan's note.)</p>
<p>I was thus greatly enlightened. It is not allowed to converse with prisoners in foreign languages in prisons, but Dr. Hu Shih opened a special case as soon as he arrived because he can (publicly expose), he can talk (very affectionately) with foreigners, he is (light), so (where light arrives, darkness) (disappears). He then (publicly exposed) the China League for Civil Rights to foreigners, and (darkness) fell on this side. But I wonder if this (light) will allow others to converse with prisoners in (English) forever after returning to his residence?</p>
<p>If it is not allowed, then it is (light leaves, and darkness returns).</p>
<p>And this (light) is also busy with the affairs of the Boxer Indemnity Committee and cannot often go into (darkness). Before the second (careful investigation) of the prison, the prisoners probably will not have the (very free) happiness of speaking (English) again. Alas, light only follows (light), and the world of light in prison is truly very temporary!</p>
<p>However, this cannot be blamed on anyone. They should never have committed a (crime). (Good people) will never commit a (crime). If you don't believe it, look at this (light)!</p>
<h3>Barbusse Comes to China</h3>
<p>— Zheng Boqi</p>
<p>At a time when Jehol has fallen, Tianjin and Beijing are in danger, and imperialism is intensifying its conspiracy to partition China, Barbusse, an (anti-imperialist) writer, has been entrusted by the (Anti-Imperialist League) to come to China with other committee members to conduct an on-the-spot investigation of the truth of Japanese imperialism's aggression against China. This is something that Chinese writers, and even people who love literature, should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Since the (September 18th) Incident, Japan has expanded the war without hindrance. The United States' observation, the League of Nations' mediation, and the elusive attitude of Britain and France all fully expose the united front of imperialism against China. The working masses have long felt the absolute opposition between imperialism and the Chinese national independence movement. In the sound of the Japanese cannons, a huge anti-imperialist movement has been launched on the East Asian continent.</p>
<p>The imperialist international, in order to maintain its prestige and to realize the conspiracy to partition China, sent Lytton and seven other military personnel and politicians to China to investigate through the League of Nations. The report of this international investigation team did not advocate for Japan to withdraw its troops, but only nakedly depicted the plan and steps for partitioning China. Except for the higher-ups among the Chinese, such as Hu Shih, everyone expressed their firm opposition. However, the imperialist powers did not relax their plan to partition China because of this. Now that Jehol has fallen and Tianjin and Beijing are in danger, the emperor emeritus of the East Legation Quarter is secretly active again. The people of the whole country are worried, anxious, and indignant, and Barbusse and others are coming to China!</p>
<p>The task of Barbusse and his entourage in coming to China is the same as that of the League of Nations investigation team led by Lytton, to investigate the various atrocities of Japanese imperialism since the (September 18th) Incident. However, their position is completely different. They are against imperialism, and they will never hide anything for violent Japan. They are against imperialism, and they will never advocate the poisonous plan of partitioning or jointly managing China. No, even further, they are as firmly opposed to partitioning and joint management as we are. They are against imperialism, and they will definitely support our anti-imperialist upsurge.</p>
<p>From this point of view, Barbusse and his entourage are completely our friends. Shouldn't we express our welcome?</p>
<h3>Random Notes from Qulu</h3>
<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>The English word "Humour" is translated as "幽默" (youmo - humorous) , which began with Lin Yutang. Today, these two characters are used together as a word and are commonly understood by scholars, just as "Utopia" is translated as "乌托邦" (wutuobang - utopia), and "Modern" is translated as "摩登" (modeng - modern) by Tian Han. Mr. Lin recently edited the "Analects Half-Monthly" and used "humor" as a call to action. Mr. Li Qingya believes that translating "humor" as "语妙" (yumiao - witty words) is better, as it can take into account both sound and meaning. Mr. Chen Wangdao wants to translate it as the "油滑" (youhua - slick) of "油腔滑调" (youqianghuadiao - glib talk). The speaker is serious, and the listeners laugh. Someone said that the Russian word equivalent to humor is translated as "狗不咬" (goubuyao - dog doesn't bite), which is simply laughable. I have recently seen that so-called humorous articles mostly take subtle sarcasm as their forte, just like what Mr. Yi Yincun calls "特别优骂" (tebie youma - especially elegant scolding). He wants to replace "humor" with "优骂" (youma - elegant scolding). However, the word "humor" is popular and unimpeded. As Xunzi said, "What is agreed upon by custom is called appropriate," so I have not yet openly proposed "优骂" as a term for discussion to Messrs. Chen, Li, and Lin. While ill, I flipped through "Gutong Miscellaneous Notes" in the "Jia Yin Weekly." Mr. Gutong does not think it is right for the word "humor" to be misunderstood. He roughly said that the word "humor" seems to be translated from the English "Humour," which refers to the wit of those who are good at making witty remarks, but the literal meaning is slightly contrary, which easily leads to misunderstandings. The sentiment of writing is always obtained between the lines, which is called "everything is in the unspoken words." However, the unspoken words are the unspoken words in the spoken words. If there are no words from the beginning, how can we know the difference between words and silence being just right. People in the Tang Dynasty liked to make allegorical sayings, thinking it was interesting, but without the former, there is no way to see the latter. If not a word is spoken, how can the wonderfulness of reality and illusion be known. I once argued that transliteration is the best method for protecting nouns, but if the meaning of Chinese characters is mixed in, so that both sound and meaning can be taken care of, one may accidentally end up with words as ugly as "ice unicorn." Although the drawbacks of the word "humor" are not to this extent, frequent misuse is very bad. How about replacing it with the characters "酉靺"? Mr. Gutong's argument was published eight years ago, and few people paid attention to it at the time. Now, the word "humor" has become a common word in the mouths of new people. Movie advertisements and cosmetics advertisements also want to borrow the word "humor" to attract attention.</p>
<h3>(Pretty Boys) and Their (Culture)</h3>
<p>— Xingzhi</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Whenever someone mentions (pretty boys), everyone immediately can visualize a (face like powder, lips like rouge, eyes full of emotion, words like laughter, naturally charming, all in the eyebrows, a lifetime of thoughts, all in the corners of the eyes) handsome young man. Jia Baoyu is a pretty boy, Tang Bohu is also a pretty boy. Throughout history, there are as many pretty boys as the countless sands of the Ganges.</p>
<p>Jia Baoyu once said: (Men are made of mud). Because they are made of mud, they melt into a mess as soon as they see (women made of water). The (men) that Jia Dashao is talking about here, of course, only refer to (pretty boys) like himself. This means that the highest authority of pretty boys is (women), and even the will to live of pretty boys is nothing but (women). Taking women as the driving force of life and women as the source of life, they are happy to do everything that can please women. Therefore, our Jia Dashao would lick the rouge on women's faces, accompany Lin Meimei to cry, be full of illnesses, be sentimental, be foolish, and also write poetry and lyrics, play drinking games, and gamble... Because (beauties) love (talented men), it has been like this since ancient times, so most pretty boys are also (talented men). Jia Baoyu and Tang Bohu are two examples.</p>
<p>Now, pretty boys are naturally still the same (face like powder, lips like rouge) pretty boys as before, but the times are advancing after all, and pretty boys are of course also advancing. What are they advancing in? Playing mahjong, dancing Charleston, singing "Sister, I Love You," filling in liberation lyrics. Occasionally, if they can't fill them in, they steal a poem or two from the ancients (and still insist that it rhymes with the original). They can also brag, flatter, and fabricate rumors. There is also a bit of progress, which is that pretty boys in ancient times, like Jia Baoyu, mostly despised fame and wealth, while today's pretty boys can use bragging and flattery to get some nominal positions in some departments or associations and receive unearned salaries.</p>
<p>In short, (pretty boys) are made of mud, are the most sentimental, are weak and unable to withstand the wind, only know how to drink alcohol, play mahjong, write nauseating poems and lyrics, write several bundles of love letters and something like essays. They have no will, no life, no vitality, and even no bones. They cannot stand or sit still, and can only lean on (pillows) and linger in sorrow. National affairs (damn it), everything (damn it). Although they sometimes complain, it is only (complaining) in the end. This is (pretty boys), a ghost, a living corpse.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>So, what is (pretty boy culture)?</p>
<p>That is the History of Swirling Palaces, "Sister, I Love You," the Charleston dance, passion, love, infatuation, sorrow, tears, wine, thighs, cherry lips, spring's fallen flowers, autumn's red leaves, loneliness, desolation, melancholy, complaints, "My love, my heart, my darling," the tragic cries of ghosts, the groans of the ill, the chirping of dying autumn insects. In short, it is disillusionment, decline, and escape from reality.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>A ghost, a living corpse, what does this era need them for? Decline, you (declining class)'s groaning! Decline, your declining class's culture!</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Recently, several gentlemen, in view of the new literary world being gloomy and ghostly figures walking around in broad daylight, volunteered to write articles to reprimand two or three petty thieves. In order to maintain the literary world and eliminate literary demons, this journal is happy to publish such critical articles that (benefit the world and people's hearts). In recent days, we have received letters from all parties praising us, which shows that (justice is in people's hearts). However, due to the limited space in this journal and the fact that there are more important tasks waiting to be started, this type of criticism will be temporarily terminated from today.</p>

<h3>Crossroads of Era and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guanping</p>
<p>(I am your fellow villager, surnamed Lin.)</p>
<p>Before Haiquan could finish speaking, the door opened. He saw Madam Cao wearing a deep blue patterned cotton cheongsam, which was even more unsightly than when he saw her at the church that day. But her face was still covered with white powder. Only those rows of pearly teeth were very moving. She opened her clothes, revealing a nipple, and was breastfeeding her child. Haiquan saw her breasts, which were also white and somewhat moving.</p>
<p>(Oh, Mr. Lin? I'm sorry, I thought it was someone else. Ha, ha, ha, please come in and sit.</p>
<p>Seeing Madam Cao's generous attitude, Haiquan felt a sense of pressure and didn't know how to deal with her.</p>
<p>(Where is Lao Cao?)</p>
<p>(He went out and will be back in a moment. Sit down. Please wait a moment, he will be back.)</p>
<p>Haiquan had no choice but to follow her in. He saw that their room had a bed, a small desk, a small round table, two wooden chairs, and four round wooden stools - the stool surfaces were painted with vulgar black lacquer orchids. These pieces of furniture and the furnishings on the table were all cluttered and disorganized. From this, it was not difficult to see the daily life of the couple. After Haiquan sat down on a chair, he still smelled a stench of urine. He then saw a large pile of wet diapers piled up in the corner of the bed, which were dirty and black.</p>
<p>Madam Cao put down the child in her arms, still exposing her nipple, poured a cup of slightly cloudy tea that looked like ox urine, and smiled as she handed it to Haiquan. He always felt that her smile was not very generous.</p>
<p>Haiquan was lost in thought for a moment and inadvertently noticed a very beautiful stroller in the corner of the door in front of him.</p>
<p>(That's a beautiful stroller, it must not be cheap!)</p>
<p>He asked with a smile.</p>
<p>(It's not necessarily that good, but in any case, we can't afford it. It was a gift from Lao Ha when the child turned one month old). (Lao Ha is being too kind.)</p>
<p>(What does that count for! To them Americans, dozens of dollars is not the same as a few dimes to us.)</p>
<p>The child started crying on the bed.</p>
<p>(So annoying! I have to hold it every minute! It really prevents me from taking a single step. I really want to throw you into the Huangpu River before I'm satisfied!)</p>
<p>Madam Cao deliberately said with gritted teeth and exaggeratedly. But she still went over and picked up the child. She showed her breasts even more unceremoniously.</p>
<p>(Where did Lao Cao go? Is he at Lao Ha's place again?)</p>
<p>(Isn't he!)</p>
<p>At this time, she gave Haiquan an unnatural flirtatious smile for no reason. Haiquan saw it and felt a slight chill. He wondered what this meant. He felt that this room was as cold as the Crystal Palace, no wonder the child's philtrum was covered with grayish-white snot.</p>
<p>(Did he have to go so early? Didn't he say that he usually goes in the afternoon?)</p>
<p>(There is something special today.)</p>
<p>(What is it?)</p>

<p>The Inevitable Stage After a Sharp Rise</p>
<p>The Gold Standard Turns Towards Reactionary Advances</p>
<p>Abundant Elasticity Creates a Triangular Process</p>
<p>Appearing at $1086, Ultimately Falling a Strong $13</p>
<p>Although the gold market opened low yesterday, the upward trend in the middle was not weak, reaching a new high price of $1086 (after the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan). However, due to unfavorable market sentiment, many people sold off, trending downwards. As a result, the closing price was lower than the previous day's. In the early morning, London telegraphic transfers (T/T) for both near and far terms decreased by 1.25, the New York silver price only fell by 1.25, the British-American exchange rate was down by 0.0225, the American-British exchange rate was also down by 0.0175, the forward price fell by 3 to 5 percent, and American cotton remained largely unchanged. All these factors failed to satisfy people. Bank private telegrams also only fell by 1.25. Due to unfavorable market sentiment, the opening price immediately dropped to $1074.5. The exchange market opened flat but slightly firm, with the British exchange rate at 1 shilling 8.125 pence and the American exchange rate at $28.875. Initially, it was extremely flat; American exchange rates for April at $29.125, May at $29.375, and June at $29.75 could all be settled. Subsequently, it retreated to around $29.70. Afterwards, it gradually improved. Jardine Matheson and Mitsui both offered June American dollars at $29.75. Buying interest gradually intensified, but when the June American exchange rate reached $29.625 and could not be settled, it broke through to beyond $29.80. Furthermore, because the June American exchange rate at $29.50 was difficult to settle, coupled with the announcement of the HSBC exchange rate, the shilling remained unchanged, and the American exchange rate further decreased by 1.25, adding fuel to the fire and surging to $1086. However, thereafter, the exchange market gradually loosened, and half a yuan for June could be settled, leading to a downward trend. Later, banks tightened, retreating to within $29.80. Citibank offered April American dollars at $28.875, indicating a loosening glut. Coupled with rumors of an emergency in North China, people were greatly frightened. North China even sold March American dollars at $29.0625. The selling trend was overwhelming, breaking through $29.70 and falling to $29.685. Although it pulled back by $0.10, the midday close was still slightly lower at $1072.5. The after-market was initially stable, opening at $1072.5, then rising to $1077.3. HSBC and others offered June American dollars at $29.75 and July American dollars at $30.125, which were difficult to sell. It dropped to $1066 twice. Later, it turned flat, and short covering was stronger. The exchange market was also flat, allowing it to pull back to beyond $1072. Shortly after, the closing price was $1070.4, with scalpers calculating an increase of $37, and no transaction was made. The daily market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $1074.5, a decrease of $9 from the previous closing price. The exchange rate was slightly firm, with the recent offering price for British exchange at 1 shilling 8.1875 pence and American exchange at $29. Later, it retreated to $29.04. Yuan Mao Yong came up to buy, raising it to $29.06. Zhao Feng Chang and Heng Xing both came to sell, lowering it to within $29.04. American exchange rates for April at $29.125, May at $29.375, and June at $29.75 could all be settled. Da Xing, Yong Fu Chang, and Chang Sheng Yong competed to sell, causing it to fall to $29.002. Items were hedged and purchased, reaching $29.025. However, because Bing Xing, Chun Yuan Yong, and others continued to sell, it was around $29.01. Banque Belge poured in April American dollars at $29.125. Yuan Chun first accepted and pulled it to beyond $29.03. Jardine Matheson and Mitsui again offered June American dollars at $29.75.

<h3>Securities: Public Bonds Under the Shadow of Rumors</h3>
<p>Silver Industry Sells Off, Downturn Intensifies</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the trend of public bonds suddenly became unstable. The Japanese invaded Tianjin, and rumors were rampant, but they had not been verified. The market air was suddenly tense. Most people still could not avoid being influenced by unfounded rumors, and sellers crowded the market. Among them, No. 46 sold off more actively. The rest were mostly retail investors. The Northern Group did not have large entries or exits. In the morning, the Disbandment bond still rose by 1 jiao. However, because the volume of sales increased more and more later, the market price fell more and more sharply. The Salt Tax fell by as much as 9 jiao. Because No. 46 was close to the financial circles, its long positions may have had considerable reason to exit. Therefore, in the next round, retail investors also followed suit in droves. The troop cut plummeted by 1 yuan 2 jiao and a half in an instant. The 19 Customs and the 19 Charity also fell by 1 yuan. After that, because the fall in the first round had been significant, the downward trend slowed slightly, with the more falling by half a yuan and the less only by 1 jiao. Although there were many rumors in the market, they still could not be verified. In the afternoon, most short sellers took advantage of the small rebounds to cover their positions. The initial photography was still flat. Starting with the far-term troop cut, it gradually trended upward and became more vigorous later. Buyers suddenly increased, and the market price rose by 3 to 5 jiao. Before the closing, the various types listed still had more entries than exits, rising another 3 to 4 jiao. Afterwards, there were temporary rumors, and sellers again occupied the majority. Starting from the 20 Customs, they returned to fatigue. Generally, they fell back by 2 to 3 jiao. As a result, they all fell sharply, from several jiao to 1 yuan 2 to 3 jiao. The trend seemed to be discouraging. If the Tianjin incident is not resolved, there will be many more storms ahead. The total transaction volume was 11,169,300 yuan, of which 3,000 yuan was in spot goods. The futures Salt Tax accounted for 4,580,000, the troop cut accounted for 1,780,000, and the 20 Customs accounted for 2,110,000. The rest ranged from 160,000 to over 1,000,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stocks Continue to Vary</h3>
<p>New Feng Foreign Company Report: On Monday (20th), the New York stock market was initially firm, but later, because professional speculators predicted that the market would be tired, they sold off first, and the price fell. However, most people firmly believed that President Roosevelt would insist on including the issues of reorganization and mergers in the legislation according to the report of the National Transportation Committee. Therefore, railway stocks rose slightly more than yesterday. There was very little outside participation in today's trading. In total, the volume of transactions for the day was only 780,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index and the market prices of several stocks are listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn: Tianjin Group Hedges and Sells Standard Yarn</h3>
<p>The yarn market, which had been hovering for a long time, suddenly trended downwards. Due to sluggish actual demand and the intense war in North China, yarn sales in Tianjin were particularly affected. A portion was hedged and sold on the Shanghai Standard, causing people to become weaker and weaker. The market suddenly fell 1 tael and 5 qian. However, the raw cotton market was relatively firm, and the yarn market was still stimulated by its excitement. In short, sales were too sluggish, and the market outlook was difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<h3>The Human Standard Falls One Tael and a Half</h3>
<p>The human standard market opened in the morning with a relatively tired market atmosphere. Because Ren Feng traded on behalf of the Tianjin Group's hedge, there were fewer buyers in the market, and the market became even more unstable, falling round after round. As a result, each month fell by 8-9 qian to 1 tael. In the afternoon, people were even more panicked, and each month fell another 4-5 qian. The total transaction statistics for the day were 48,400 bales. The sales included Mingde 2,800 bales, Rui 6700 bales, Yu Kang 650 bales, Ren Feng 2,650 bales, Xin Cheng 800 bales, Da Chang 1,000 bales, Xie Sheng 750 bales, and Xinhua 1,550 bales.

<p>Ningbo 15, Guangdong 195, Datong 5, Hankou 10, Fujian 10</p>
<p>Wuhu 7, Inland 50, Northern Group 15, Shantou 120, Fellow Traders 57</p>
<h3>A Weak Cotton Standard</h3>
<p>The cotton market is slightly tired, but the trend is still high. Because the long positions are absorbing, the amount is firm and not released. The dip is still added to the code, so the market is similar to the yarn market. Most people are psychologically optimistic about the market this month because of the lack of delivery chips, but the overseas cotton market is still tired, the yarn market is falling, and the factory's intention to enter is relatively slow.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Falls by Two or Three Qian</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard market opened in the morning with no change in the overseas cotton market and a flat gold market. The market was still firm each month. The yarn market fell after two or three rounds of photography, and the cotton market fell. Each month fell by two, three, and qian.

<h3>Grain Prices: Scarcity of River Rice at He Xia</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, only 30 to 40 shipments arrived. Retail sales were sluggish. Only about 1,000 shi of rice were moved from the wholesale markets. Additionally, continuous arrivals further softened the market. Rice from Suzhou, Tongxiang, Qingjiao, and Nanxun held steady for high-quality grades, but lower grades dropped by 3 to 5 cents. Du Yang Jian and inferior Bian Yuan rice showed weakness.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over 30 boats from various He Xia guilds arrived. The price of ordinary daily white japonica rice rose slightly due to some demand. The market weakened further. Thin japonica rice arrivals were minimal and sold evenly, maintaining a steady price. Early rice arrivals were strong, but sales were stagnant, with a slight price decrease. Continuous arrivals of Yang Du Bu Jian were somewhat acceptable for retail. Prices weakened by several cents. Customer Jian rice was stable. Although Yin Yuan arrivals were not strong, retail sales were lacking. Price negotiations were down 2 to 3 cents. White Yuan rice showed a slight downward trend.</p>
<h3>Stalled Sales of Customer Xian Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer xian rice market saw few arrivals, but even slower sales. With slight inventory remaining, both market trends and selling prices indicated a decline. After several days of brisk business, the Fujian guild indicated a halt the day before yesterday, and yesterday's activity decreased further, resulting in stagnation. The entire market only saw 188 bags of Wuhu Ji Yuan rice sold at 9 yuan 35 cents, and 278 bags of Hunan Xi Jing rice at 6 yuan 55 cents. Our street only sold 200 bags of Hunan Ji red rice at 8 yuan 55 cents. Offers for other types of rice decreased by a dime, but owners were unwilling to sell cheaply, and the market saw no transactions, indicating a general softening.</p>
<h3>This Month's Flour Resale Decline</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning's opening of the flour market saw all months generally fluctuate in a flat and weak range. With quotes for foreign wheat, both US and Canadian wheat were down a dime or two, creating instability in the market. Many outside investors engaged in buying and selling across near and far terms, which resulted in brisk trading but a flat and stable market. Until the afternoon session, the long position holders of the Customer guild for this month gradually resold because the factories had abundant chips and found it difficult to support the price. The minimum opening was 1.276 yuan. The major factories were not active in the long-term months, but the smaller factories slightly sold out, causing the market to continue to be sluggish. The current stagnation of buying interest is due to the increasing national crisis and tight monetary policy. If supply continues to exceed demand, the market will likely remain weak and lifeless. As a result, this month was down 5 li compared to the previous day, April/May down 2.5 li, June down 5 li, and July/August down 2.5 li.</p>
<h3>Primary Causes of the Weakness of Standard Bean Cakes</h3>
<p>Continuous Telegrams Indicate Sluggish Transactions</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bean cake market saw weakness in both Guangbian and Youbian standard cakes after the morning opening. Due to small telegrams from Dalian, guild merchants sold off on the market, causing market prices to decline across all terms. Guangbian April term was down 2 cents from the previous day, Youbian May term was down 1.5 cents, and June lower term was down 1.75 li. During the afternoon session, transactions for all months became even more stagnant. Only the June lower term was active, but it was down another 2.5 li from the morning.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Further Rise in Holland Red and White Sugar</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw continued tightness due to rising spot prices.

Taikoo sugar also rose from 1 cent to 5 cents: B mark at 16 taels, CW mark at 15.85 taels, DY mark at 15.8 taels, HX mark at 15.7 taels.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: Glutinous Rice Sticks Increase in Price</h3>

<p>Jinshan branches have been scarce in recent arrivals, and existing stock is dwindling, with some merchants holding firmly. Market trends are becoming increasingly tight.

Yesterday, merchants were quoting top-grade Yuan branches at 27.5 taels, medium grade at 25 to 22 taels, top-grade flat branches at 34.2 taels, and lower grades at 29 taels. Glutinous rice branches are the scarcest, with good quality broken rice sticks now quoted at 100 taels.</p>
<h3>Metals: Extreme Shortage of 6-Fen Road Leather in Stock</h3>

<h3>Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Launch</h3>
<p>Austerity to Fund National Salvation</p>
<p>Monthly Fundraising of Ten Million Yuan Possible</p>
<p>Guangzhou – Patriotic overseas Chinese in Vietnam recently launched a plan to save on meal expenses and transfer the savings to fund resistance against Japan. The plan aims to raise ten million yuan per month. Many believe that this movement is a way for China to save itself, and Guangzhou has already responded. According to today's calculations, if Guangzhou implements this plan, it can obtain at least 200,000 yuan per month, which is 2.5 million yuan per year. This movement was started last year in Ke Luye, French Annam. Although there are only 3,000 Chinese merchants there, it has raised a huge amount of money, including remitting 20,000 yuan to the 19th Route Army, 50,000 yuan to the Northeast Volunteer Army, and 10,000 yuan to the Guangzhou Disabled Soldiers Hospital, achieving remarkable results. People here plan to expand the movement. Three representatives from Vietnam have recently arrived here to promote this austerity-based national salvation movement and plan to go to Shanghai, Nanjing, Tianjin, Shantou, Xiamen, and other places to carry out promotion. The proposed method is for shops or homes to save 20% of their food expenses and transfer the savings to national salvation funds. The representatives have now written to the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters, requesting guidance and support. (Reuters dispatch, 22nd)</p>

There was absolutely no intention to replace the League of Nations with the cooperation of the four major powers—Britain, France, Germany, and Italy—mentioned in the Rome communiqué.</p>
<h3>Britain and France Issue a Joint Communiqué</h3>

<p>League of Nations Sanctions Against Japan</p>
<p>Drastic Measures Are Likely Impossible</p>
<p>Reuters, The Hague, 21st – Today, someone in the Dutch Upper House proposed that the League of Nations should take tough measures. Foreign Minister Beelaerts van Blokland replied that it would likely be impossible for the League of Nations to host a boycott of Japan because the boycott measures would be too drastic, and two major powers (the United States and Soviet Russia) are not currently members of the League of Nations. Therefore, this matter cannot be realized.</p>
<h3>Shifts in Japanese Politics</h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd – Finance Minister Takahashi visited Prime Minister Saito at the Prime Minister's official residence in Nagatacho at 9:00 AM today for important talks. At the end of last year, Finance Minister Takahashi relied on Prime Minister Saito's request to visit President Suzuki, where the anti-government sentiment at the time was quite strong, to ease the attitude of the Seiyukai and request assistance in the Diet. At the same time, regarding the shift in the political situation after the Diet, he hinted at a considerable understanding. As a result, the Saito Cabinet was able to pass through the current Diet safely. Now that the Diet is about to close, and in view of the Seiyukai's early anticipation of a shift in the political situation, Finance Minister Takahashi, as the negotiator at the time, is responsible for inquiring Prime Minister Saito about his intentions in this regard. Therefore, the future of the political situation is now showing subtle shifts.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 22nd – Prime Minister Saito plans to visit Prince Saionji after the Diet ends to explain in detail the international relations after withdrawing from the League of Nations, the recent situation in Manchukuo, and future diplomatic policies and financial issues, and seek his understanding.

The appointment is scheduled for early April.</p>
<p>Japan Federation, Tokyo, 22nd – Recently, various parties have demanded the establishment of an agency like the Diplomatic General Staff Headquarters to decide on national policies regarding diplomacy and quickly resolve diplomatic issues. The Privy Council had advocated for the establishment of a diplomatic investigation committee directly under the Emperor during the Terauchi Cabinet to achieve this goal. Now that Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations, it is necessary to thoroughly implement independent diplomacy and make other countries recognize Japan's just stance that it was unable to advocate in the League of Nations meetings. For this purpose, it is absolutely necessary to establish a large agency like the Diplomatic Investigation Committee and implement strong diplomacy. Recently, the Privy Council has unofficially conveyed the Privy Council's internal views on this issue to the government, and the government seems to be considering it.</p>

<h3>Britain and Russia</h3>
<p>Trade Agreement Negotiations Stalled</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 21st – Moscow diplomatic sources believe that the British government's suspension of trade agreement negotiations with Russia was expected. This was the result of four British employees of the British-Russian company Vickers Electrical Company being accused of conspiracy. Britain wants to use this to exchange for the unconditional release of the accused, but diplomatic sources here fear that this move by Britain will only make Russia's attitude more firm. Six British employees of Vickers Company were arrested on March 12th. Two were released after two days, and four are still in prison.</p>

<p>To Resolve the Sino-Japanese Issue</p>
<p>Advocated by Seiyukai Member Ashida</p>
<p>(Havas, Tokyo Correspondence, March): Dr. Ashida, the chairman of the Japan Times, is an old diplomat and an influential figure in the Seiyukai. During the recent session of the Imperial Diet, Ashida raised questions, accusing Japanese diplomacy of being dictated by the military. When this case was raised, people in Geneva discussed it, and then so did people in Japan.</p>
<p>Ashida recently published an article in the Japan Times, outlining the basis for Japan's new policy based on his own views.</p>
<p>Dr. Ashida said that Japan, due to its discord with Geneva, has decided to disregard the countries of the world and adopt a completely independent policy. However, it does not know that various things in the international economy, culture, and geography are interconnected. If this relationship is not changed one day, no country can isolate itself from the world. If it must be done, it is to return to the Tokugawa era and completely lose the status of a great power that has been painstakingly acquired.</p>
<p>In addition, Japan cannot give up much of its established policy toward Manchuria. The recognition of Japan's special rights in Manchuria is not a problem at present. This is because such rights were recognized by the powers before the European War. Former British Foreign Secretary Lord Curzon informed the Japanese government that Britain recognized Japan's superior position in the Far East. In 1917, U.S. Secretary of State Lansing also declared to Japanese Ambassador Ishii Viscount that the United States recognized that Japan had special interests in Manchuria. (Editor's note: The Lansing-Ishii Agreement has been cancelled successively with the Anglo-Japanese Alliance, and the above statements are no longer valid.) Therefore, the current problem is not here.</p>
<p>In short, the goal of Japan and the League of Nations is the same: (to maintain peace in the Far East). The only difference is the method of achieving this goal. Japan believes that Manchuria's separation from China and its establishment as an independent country is an indispensable condition for maintaining peace in the Far East, while the League of Nations holds the opposite view. What the League of Nations is arguing for is form, while Japan emphasizes reality.</p>
<p>However, the reason for the conflict between Japan and the League of Nations is not entirely the Manchurian problem. Japan's clumsy diplomacy and failure to adapt to changing circumstances are the biggest reasons.</p>
<p>The current situation cannot be allowed to continue like this for a long time. This situation must be broken. To achieve this goal, Japan's policy must be reformed based on the following points:</p>
<p>1. Japan should strive to delay other countries' decisions for three or four years. After this period, Manchuria can be developed and (Manchukuo) can be stabilized.</p>
<p>2. After three or four years, the relationship between China and (Manchukuo) should improve, and the current difficulties will naturally disappear.</p>
<p>3. Although Japan is determined to defend (Manchukuo), it has no ambition to invade Chinese territory or Siberia. Japan should compromise with China and the Soviet Union to guarantee the borders of (Manchukuo) on this level.</p>
<p>4. The chaotic situation in China poses a long-term danger to Sino-Japanese relations and peace in the Far East. This point has been recognized in the Lytton Report. Japan should cooperate sincerely to consolidate the central government of China and assist it in its struggle against the Communist Party and bandits with the same mentality.</p>
<p>5. Every effort should be made to completely eliminate the misunderstanding between Japan and the United States. The origin of this misunderstanding is mostly due to American public opinion, which mistakenly believes that Japan has the ambition to invade territory in China, or even Siberia. Attempts should be made to dispel it.</p>
<p>Ashida advocated convening a conference in Tokyo of countries related to the Pacific in order to determine Japan's new policy based on the above principles.</p>
<p>The agenda for this conference is roughly as follows:</p>
<p>1. To consolidate the central government of China through international cooperation.</p>
<p>2. To sign arbitration and friendship treaties by countries along the Pacific coast, including Soviet Russia, China, (Manchukuo), Japan, and the United States.</p>
<p>3. To discuss Japan's proposed naval disarmament plan. Ashida believes that the greatest difficulty is to get China to participate in this conference, and the Japanese diplomatic authorities should work hard to achieve this.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Union's National Defense in the Five-Year Plan (Continued)</h3>
<p>The Red Army did not have tanks before either. During the civil war, the dozens of tanks captured from the White Army and interventionists could not actually be counted as tank weapons. But before 1929, these dozens of tanks were the only samples used to train the Red Army. When reviewing the Red Army, we would often display these dozens of tanks, and foreigners would often laugh to themselves when they saw them. However, the significance of tanks in modern warfare is extremely important. Machine guns are deployed across the entire line, and they cannot be broken through without the use of tanks. This is why the armies of various countries are paying close attention to tanks. At the same time, the armies of various countries are making efforts to study the various functions of tank technology and strategy, and this is also the reason.</p>
<p>What was even more difficult was that before 1928, the Soviet Union had absolutely no technical personnel who could manufacture tanks themselves, whether in the automobile industry or the tractor manufacturing industry, let alone anything else. Therefore, we first had to imitate foreign tank styles. As a result of our efforts, we can now manufacture new-style tanks. Not only can we manufacture them ourselves, but we have also established a foundation for manufacturing tanks and trained skilled craftsmen. Now, we can also say without exaggeration that during the four years of the first five-year plan, we have completely learned new-style tank weapons in manufacturing and military applications.</p>
<p>Regarding the air force, let me say a few words. The Soviet Union's air force was not weak before 1928. Great progress has been made both before and at the beginning of the first five-year plan. However, in terms of the quality of aircraft, such as flight altitude and payload, it could not keep up with the world's aviation technology. During the four years of the first five-year plan, the Soviet Union's aircraft manufacturing industry did make great progress. The Soviet Union invented several new types of aviation engines, which are now being manufactured in large quantities. A lot of aviation talent has also been trained. We believe that during the second five-year plan, the Soviet Union will definitely catch up with the world's aviation technology level, and even surpass it.</p>
<p>As for the navy, the five-year plan naturally did not take it lightly. During the four years, all fleets were repaired, and some were thoroughly renovated. The submarine fleet was also strengthened, and coastal defense was greatly consolidated. The number of naval personnel has increased greatly, and their knowledge and naval skills have improved compared to before. Needless to say, the shipbuilding industry has also developed.</p>
<p>All of this technological transformation of the Red Army's armaments was not only not an easy task for us military personnel, but also cost the country a lot. What we are talking about here is still the expenditure used for the Red Army's armaments technology. The expenditure used to create the foundation for the military industry is not included. In 1927-28, the amount of money used for technology was already considerable, and during the five-year plan, the cost of implementing the transformation of armaments was naturally even greater. However, it was precisely because of this that the Red Army was able to be thoroughly transformed technologically, so that the Red Army was not only greatly consolidated in terms of revolutionary spirit, organization, and military discipline, but also incomparably consolidated in terms of Soviet military technology (including complex military technologies such as the air force and tanks).</p>
<p>Finally, let me briefly talk about the Red Army's cadres. The modernization of military technology naturally requires a large number of technical personnel, engineers, and officers with commercial and military knowledge. The training institution for officers is the Army University. In 1928, there were a total of 3,198 students in all Army Universities. In 1932, the various Army Universities were specialized, and the number of students increased even more, and various methods were adopted to strengthen the training of military instructors. In recent years, the results in this area will be fully demonstrated.</p>
<p>However, the reform of military technology not only requires senior officers, but also requires middle and lower-ranking officers. During the five-year plan, all military schools in the Soviet Union were greatly reformed, and many new military specialized schools were established, such as aviation, tanks, and logistics.</p>
<p>During the first five-year plan, what changed in the army itself was the re-deployment of company and platoon leaders. This was to adapt to the technological transformation of the Red Army. For example, the number of infantry officers was slightly reduced, as was the cavalry. On the contrary, the number of artillery teams, tank teams, and other engineers and officers has increased greatly.</p>
<p>The social composition of officers has also been greatly improved. In 1928, workers accounted for 28%, and in 1932, this had increased to 40%. The number of party members among officers has also increased greatly. In 1928, it was 55%, and in 1932, it had increased to 61%. In particular, the number of party members among senior and important military personnel has increased even more. For example, among artillery officers, the percentage increased from 15% to 81% during the same period, and among infantry officers, it increased from 54% to 88%. The entire armored car force was composed of party members.</p>
<p>The number of Communist Youth League members (the party's reserve army) in the Red Army has increased even faster. In 1928, party members and youth league members accounted for 31.6% of all Red Army soldiers and officers. Now, this has increased to 59.4%. The general cultural level of Red Army soldiers, officers, and political workers has also greatly improved. The army has also established combat training classes and various lecture groups to cultivate the military and political lives of officers and soldiers.

<h3>Tian Jun Recovers Bazhong</h3>
<p>Bandits Fleeing Towards Qingjiangdu</p>
<p>Only Bloodstains and Abandoned Corpses Seen in the City</p>
<p>Sichuan Correspondence: The red bandits in Bazhong have been repeatedly attacked fiercely by the National Army under Tian Songyao's command. Despite repeated setbacks, they have stubbornly defended themselves. On March 9, a battalion of bandits came to Xishan to surrender, strongly stating that the red bandits were internally shaken and lacked bullets. According to reconnaissance reports, it was also said that the bandit army was surrounded on three sides by the National Army, making it difficult to advance or retreat. They were at their wit's end, and in addition, their food was running out. They intended to make a final desperate struggle, but if they failed, they would immediately flee elsewhere. After receiving the news, Zeng and Luo divisions of Tian's command dispatched elite troops from the Maobitan Fort and the Ya Pass at dawn on the 10th to attack in separate directions. They also first ordered Xue's regiment to cross the river from Lianghekou to threaten Wangwang Mountain. Song Peigen's regiment guarded the original line with a part of its troops, and personally led a part of its troops to fiercely attack the bandits in Bazhong City. The officers and soldiers, because they had been in a stalemate for a long time, were unusually angry, so they were all fearless and invincible. The bandits were also extremely stubborn and fought desperately. Short-range melee combat was very fierce. Finally, at 9 a.m., the bandits were repelled and Bazhong City was completely occupied. The red bandits fled in droves towards Jianshanping, Qingjiangdu, and Silin Bridge. The National Army also followed closely, capturing and killing many. Song's regiment then occupied Wangwang Mountain, and Zhu's regiment occupied Chaqi Mountain and Tazi Mountain, clearing out the bandits in the area near Bazhong City. Zeng's division sent Li Weiruo to command the troops and Liao's brigade to cross the river from Sanhekou and Shi Temple to advance and occupy Zhenzi Ya. Zeng's regiment occupied Daliang Mountain and Leigu Village, cooperating to encircle and suppress the remnant bandits. After the National Army entered Bazhong City, the remaining civilians were all delighted and encouraged, and stood on the roadside to welcome them. When asked about the red bandits' devastation, they all said that the food had been completely searched by the bandits. The people who remained in the county were either killed by the red bandit authorities or abused by the red bandits. The various sufferings were unbearable to hear. As for the houses, half of them were destroyed, and the market was also extremely desolate. What was reflected in the eyes were only the red bandit slogans between the walls, the mottled bloodstains in the streets and alleys, and the piles of abandoned corpses under the city and in the fields.

<h3>Aviation Association Establishes Aviation School</h3>
<p>School Site Has Been Negotiated</p>
<p>Borrowing Hongqiao Airport</p>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association will establish an aviation school to develop China's aviation industry and train civil aviation personnel. This proposal has been planned for a long time. Regarding the issue of the school site, the directors of the association all believe that Shanghai is a suitable place. Because Shanghai is the most developed commercial port in China, it is convenient to hire professors and purchase equipment. The headquarters of the Aviation Association is also in Shanghai, so managing the school will not be isolated. However, Shanghai lacks a large site for practice. After discussion by the Standing Committee, it was decided to borrow the Hongqiao Airport of the Aviation Administration and to temporarily borrow the Administration's training aircraft for teaching. Therefore, the association specially sent its Secretary-General, Lin Wojiang, to Hangzhou to negotiate with Ge Jingen, the Director of the Aviation Administration. Lin returned to Shanghai last night. The reporter made a special visit to inquire about the progress of the negotiation. According to him, Director Ge has already agreed to borrow the site, but the matter of borrowing training aircraft is still under negotiation. Therefore, a meeting of the Standing Committee will be convened within days to report on the progress of the negotiation, and then a plan of action will be discussed. Director Ge is very concerned about the association, so he also offered suggestions to establish a machine factory, starting with a small scale, regardless of whether it is self-made or repaired, and striving to achieve the goal of self-manufacturing and self-repair. This idea is very good, so it will be reported to the Standing Committee for discussion.</p>
<h3>Northeast Opens for Thawing and Navigation Today</h3>
<p>Huge Amount of Grain Transported</p>
<p>Two Million Bags of Wheat Flour</p>
<p>Forty to Fifty Thousand Bags of White Rice</p>
<p>Yingkou and Andong in the Northeast have been closed to navigation for more than three months since the winter freeze. Today, thawing will begin, and Shanghai merchant ships will resume navigation to Yingkou starting today. However, at the beginning of this thawing and opening of navigation, a large amount of rice and flour suddenly went to the puppet state from Shanghai. This matter is not only related to people's livelihood, but also violates the ban. This newspaper reporter went to various places to investigate the details as follows:</p>
<h3>Ordering Large Quantities of Flour and Rice</h3>
<p>At this time of Japanese mobilization to attack Rehe, the front line needs a huge amount of food. It is said that the Japanese army eats white rice, while the puppet Manchurian army eats wheat flour. Therefore, recently, the Northeast has come to Shanghai to purchase a large amount of wheat flour, up to more than two million bags, mostly Green Soldier Brand. They also secretly purchased 40,000 to 50,000 bags of white rice. The destination of the transportation is divided into two places. Before Yingkou thawed, it was loaded to Dalian. Now that Yingkou has thawed, it is directly transported from Shanghai to that port for unloading. Various Shanghai Chinese and British merchant ships are competing to load them, including Haichang, Yu Da, Taifeng, Datong, Zhaoxing, Zhengji, and Taikoo.</p>
<h3>Navigation Starts Today</h3>
<p>A telegram from Yingkou said that the port there has thawed and is scheduled for the 25th of this month. Shanghai ships will start loading cargo to Yingkou today. Datong Company's Tongshun ship will transport 2,400 bags of white rice and 104,000 bags of wheat flour today. Taikoo's Zhejiang ship will also carry more than 100,000 bags of wheat flour. Taifeng's Fengxiang will also start operating today. According to the Jianghai Customs, it has long prohibited the transportation of food to the Northeast, and the Ministry of Communications has also instructed the various shipping bureaus not to load food to the Anyinglian ports of the puppet state. However, the general ships and vehicles are all turning a deaf ear to the order and competing to carry it. It is not known how the customs will handle it.</p>
<h3>Forcing Crew Members to Register</h3>
<p>When Yingkou and Andong were closed to rivers in the winter, the puppet state issued a fake order stating that when Chinese merchant ships sailed to the puppet state's seaports, in addition to paying taxes and banknotes upon entry, it also added that Chinese ships sailing to Yingkou and Andong must have the puppet customs inspect the ships and issue an inspection certificate before they can sail. It also ordered all Chinese ships entering Yingkou to register their crew members with the puppet state, paying a registration fee of two yuan or five yuan per person, which is the same as our country's regulations. This time, it will be forced to implement it.</p>
<h3>Strict Inspection Situation</h3>
<p>Dalian has prohibited the import of Shanghai Chinese newspapers. If anyone carries them, they will be heavily fined once they are found. Chinese people going to Dalian or Yingkou Andong from Shanghai must undergo a special search. In addition to unloading and inspecting luggage and items one by one, even the edges and linings of clothes and the linings of hats on the head must be opened on the spot with a knife and inspected by Japanese agents, and viewed against the sunlight. If there is any discrepancy, they will be considered spies and arrested, and their lives will be difficult to protect.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Jiang</h3>
<p>Answered Visit to Arichi This Morning</p>
<p>Arichi Akira, the Japanese ambassador to China, visited Chiang Tso-pin, our ambassador to Japan, on Lafayette Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday, accompanied by Counselor Arino. Ambassador Chiang made a special visit to Ambassador Arichi at the Japanese Consulate on the Bund at 10:00 a.m. this morning. He left after talking for about 20 minutes.</p>
<h3>More Antiquities Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Loading Begins This Afternoon</p>
<p>The first and second batches of antiquities transported to Shanghai, totaling 2,554 boxes, arrived in Shanghai on the Kuaili ship from Beijing at about 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Due to the urgency of time, it was rescheduled to be unloaded and transported from the shore starting this morning and stored at No. 26, Tianzhutang Street, in the French Concession. However, it suddenly rained heavily this morning, and it only cleared up at about 11:00 a.m. Therefore, unloading began at 12:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>Disarmament Conference</h3>
<p>Actually Restricts Our Development of the Air Force</p>
<p>China's Number of Aircraft is Only One-Fifth of Japan's</p>
<p>Makes Us Incapable of Self-Defense and Should Resolutely Oppose</p>
<p>The World Disarmament Conference has fallen into a stalemate due to the issue of restricting air forces. Recently, British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon proposed standards for restricting air forces, the content of which is that the five major powers, Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan, shall not exceed 500 aircraft, and the rest shall be reduced in turn. China is actually restricted to no more than 100 aircraft. The Disarmament Conference will be held tomorrow (23rd). It is not known whether the proposal can be passed or whether it can be implemented after it is passed. However, it is deeply noteworthy for the Chinese people amidst the aviation salvation movement. Lin Wojiang, Secretary-General of the Aviation Association, told the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter this morning that China has an extremely long coastline and vast borders, and the equipment of the army and navy cannot be compared with that of the powers. If the air force is further restricted, it will be no different from placing our country in a position where it cannot defend itself, which the Chinese people should resolutely oppose. China's air force today is still less than a hundred aircraft. Whether it can build an air force sufficient for self-defense depends on the efforts of the Chinese people and the government, but there is a huge difference between this and being restricted internationally and thus unable to establish it.</p>
<h3>Soong Tzu-wen Summons Qian Xinzhi, etc.</h3>
<p>To Discuss Financial Issues</p>
<p>Finance Minister Soong Tzu-wen summoned Li Fusun and other financial magnates of this port after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday morning. At about 10:00 a.m. this morning, Soong summoned Qian Xinzhi, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, etc. at his private residence on Qiqi Road. There were close consultations on financial matters, and discussions continued until noon before they left successively. It is heard that Soong's visit to Shanghai this time is purely to contact the financial community of this port on a certain financial issue, and he has obtained considerable results.</p>
<h3>Wang Delin's Family Members Arrived in Qingdao Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Depart Qingdao South Tomorrow</p>
<p>Can Arrive in Shanghai on the 25th</p>
<p>A total of 188 family members and wounded soldiers of the generals under Wang Delin, the Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Volunteer Army, passed through Siberia to Vladivostok and transferred to the China Merchants Bureau's Wuyou ship. They arrived in Tanggu on the 16th. Except for 19 wounded soldiers who transferred to cars to go to Beijing for medical treatment and 11 women and children who went to Beijing to visit relatives and friends, the remaining 158 people still took the original ship south to Shanghai on the 19th. According to the telegram received by the China Merchants Bureau from the Wuyou ship this morning, the ship arrived safely in Qingdao on the 21st and is scheduled to leave Qingdao for Shanghai on the 23rd. It is expected that it will be able to arrive at the port on the 25th. Zhang Chuyu, Wang Delin's representative in Shanghai, has already contacted various agencies and organizations in Shanghai to find ways to take care of them.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang to Go Abroad Next Month</h3>
<p>Since Zhang Xueliang resigned and came to Shanghai, he has planned to go abroad, but because the visa procedures for various countries are not easy to complete for a while, he has not been able to go immediately. This morning, according to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency who is close to Zhang, Zhang has decided to leave Shanghai in early next month. Zhang's younger brother, Xueming, has come south to Shanghai from Beijing, but there is no definite date for his arrival in Shanghai. It is not yet confirmed whether he will travel abroad with Zhang on this trip.</p>
<h3>Today, the Japanese Marines Again</h3>
<p>Hold Attack and Defense Drills</p>
<p>Today, the Japanese Shanghai Daily News reported that the First and Third Battalions of the Japanese Marines would conduct attack and defense drills near the Dakang Yarn Factory starting at 6:00 AM today.</p>

<h3>Concession to Levy Entertainment Tax</h3>
<p>May Be Resolved at the Beginning of Next Month</p>
<p>Regarding the collection of entertainment tax in this city, the municipal area has already begun collecting. The concession has not yet been implemented due to the opposition of the Municipal Council. The municipal government authorities believe that the entertainment tax is a national tax, and no one should be allowed to obstruct it under any pretext. Cai Zengji, Director of the Municipal Finance Bureau, negotiated with the concession authorities again yesterday to discuss the implementation methods. It is understood that the concession is no longer firmly opposed to this, and it is expected that it can be resolved starting next month.</p>
<h3>Cargo Transfer Business Shipping Slips</h3>
<p>Ministry of Finance Approves Exemption from Stamp Duty</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, according to the letter from the Cargo Transfer Business Association, requested that the Ministry of Finance approve the exemption of shipping slips from stamp duty. The chamber immediately forwarded the request for exemption. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has approved the request, stating: "We have received the submission. The shipping slips issued by the cargo transfer business are temporary slips given by the carrier company to the cart drivers to be presented to the store shipping the goods. They are not substitutes for bills of lading or official receipts. Since the bills of lading, etc., already comply with the regulations for stamp duty, these shipping slips should be exempt from stamp duty. In addition to instructing the Jiangsu Stamp and Alcohol Tax Bureau to comply, you are to notify them accordingly."</p>
<h3>Abolition of the Confucius Temple Sweeping Bureau</h3>
<p>The Confucius Temple on Confucius Temple Road, Xiaoximen, in this city, has traditionally had a Sweeping Bureau. The Municipal Bureau of Education, intending to use the Confucius Temple to establish a public education center, submitted a request to the Municipal Government for instructions on whether the Confucius Temple Sweeping Bureau should be abolished and how the bureau's assets should be handled. The Municipal Government then forwarded the request to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education for instructions. The Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education have replied, stating: "Regarding the property of the Confucius Temple, the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Education, together with the Ministry of Finance, have formulated the Regulations for the Custody of Confucius Temple Property, which have been promulgated and implemented. The Confucius Temple Sweeping Bureau is no longer necessary and should be abolished within a time limit. The Confucius Temple property under its management should be received and managed by the local educational administrative authorities in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Custody Regulations."</p>
<h3>Newspaper Vendor Murdered</h3>
<p>Zhou Yiting Dies Under a Sharp Axe</p>
<p>Zhou Yiting, a native of Nanjing, was fifty years old. He lived at No. 190, Shanqing Lane, Avenue Edward VII. He was a newspaper vendor. Because he had been in the business for many years, he had accumulated some savings. At the same time, he was quite respected among the newspaper vendors. However, Zhou did not rest on his laurels because of his age, and still went out every morning to manage everything. Unexpectedly, at about 6:00 AM this morning, just as Zhou was walking out of his house, several thugs suddenly jumped out from the side of Shanqing Lane, wielding sharp axes. Without asking any questions, they slashed Zhou five times in a row. After being attacked, Zhou cried out for help. When the nearby police arrived, the suspects had already fled. The Chinese police officer No. 1782 reported the incident to the police station, which dispatched a vehicle to rush Zhou to Tongren Hospital for treatment. However, due to the severity of his injuries, he died in the hospital at 9:00 AM. The hospital reported the death to the police station, which sent the body to the morgue for examination. At the same time, the police station dispatched detectives to search for the suspects. It was learned that Zhou suffered five axe wounds, three to the head and two to the shoulder. The three wounds to the head were the most fatal.</p>
<h3>Acquittal in the Bizarre Case of Encouraging Shaved Heads</h3>
<p>Failure to Find Evidence of a Crime</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin, a native of Pudong, has recently been enticing unemployed vagrants on various roads, claiming to recommend certain occupations, requiring them to shave their heads. Those who were deceived obeyed. Therefore, the number of beggars with shaved heads seen on the road recently has suddenly increased. Wu Ren'en, Tang Rongzhang, and others were all deceived and became suspicious of Lu. They successively reported to the police station, which detained Lu and sent him to the First Special District Local Court for a hearing. The court ordered him to be detained pending further investigation. It was reported in the previous newspaper. It is now learned that after the police station detained Lu, they immediately began an investigation. Although his actions were suspicious and his behavior bizarre, no evidence sufficient to constitute a crime was found. He only induced people to shave their heads and a strange copper coin suspected of being a symbol of a traitor was found on him. This could not be considered evidence. Therefore, when the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi continued the hearing of the case this morning, he appeared in court to explain the investigation, saying that the police station did not advocate prosecution. Judge Feng then ordered Lu Wenbin to be released.</p>
<h3>Continuing to Capture the Culprits of the Nanyang Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>Inside the factory of Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company at No. 269 Broadway Road, a foreman in the tobacco leaf department named Zhang Desheng suddenly incited a riot on Monday morning of this week, gathering fifty to sixty workers who were incited to join him. They swarmed into the tin-packaging department on the third floor and rioted, wielding weapons and violently assaulting the factory staff members Li Zhitang, Li Yongyao, and the carpenter Chen Ronggui, who was trying to mediate, causing injuries. The Huishan Police Station, upon hearing the alarm, immediately dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives to the scene to stop the disturbance and arrested Zhang Desheng, the ringleader. The three injured, Li Zhitang, etc., were sent to the hospital for treatment. The situation was finally calmed down. The next morning, the police station sent Zhang to the First Special District Local Court for a hearing on the 28th of this month. Yesterday morning, when Zhang was being interrogated in court, representatives from both labor and management were present in court to listen. Wu Shiyuan, a worker who had supported Zhang Desheng, was also in the audience. Hong Haiquan, the director of the tin-packaging department, who had been summoned to testify, caught sight of him. Hong reported to the Chinese and foreign detectives in charge of the case that Wu was actually a perpetrator at the scene. Therefore, as the crowd was leaving the courtroom after Zhang's case was heard, Wu Shiyuan was detained by the police station. Under questioning, Wu confessed that Li A Jin, a native of Tongzhou, was also one of the culprits. Thus, Li was also arrested. This morning, Wu and Li were sent to the First Special Court, where Judge Wu Zehan interrogated them. Nanyang Company's representative lawyer Wu Linkun appeared in court to explain everything, while the police lawyer Zhang Tianyin requested that the case be postponed to the 28th, so that it could be merged with Zhang Desheng's case. Judge Wu immediately approved the request. After briefly questioning the two defendants, Wu and Li, he ordered them to be detained and postponed the hearing.</p>
<h3>Robbery of a Cigarette Shop</h3>
<p>At about 8:30 PM last night, four bandits speaking with a northern accent suddenly entered Bingfeng Cigarette Shop No. 128, Yongfu Lane, Tianbao Road, Zhabei. Two were wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers, and two were wearing gray cloth clothes. Three of the bandits, holding guns, entered the shop, frightening everyone into silence. They pulled open the cash drawer and robbed 26 yuan in silver dollars and more than 30 jiao in small silver coins and fractional notes. They then fled outwards. Afterwards, the owner urgently reported to the first branch of the fifth district, which dispatched long-term police officers to pursue them. However, the bandits had already fled far away. The police were instructed to apprehend them.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Credit</h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper reported that several Swedish children pooled their money to remit funds to a factory in Italy to purchase hand-cranked organs. When there was no news, they jointly wrote to Prime Minister Mussolini. Mussolini not only sent the goods as requested, but also attached a personal letter explaining that the factory had gone bankrupt and apologizing to the children. We live in this world (denying responsibility like someone pointing at a cow's head after stealing it), (saying white lies without blushing). To actually hear such an unprecedented, world-shattering, miraculous event is truly surprising and admirable. We are speechless and cannot retract our astonishment!</p>
<p>The practice of remitting money to buy goods and then receiving (no news) is not considered a particularly (remarkable rare event) in our esteemed country, which is known as the (land of etiquette and righteousness, where credit is fundamental). It is not worth being surprised by. However, for a monster whose power is enough to shake the world, the authoritarian Mussolini of the Fascists, to know that the bankruptcy of a factory in his own country affects the nation's own position, dignity, and credit, and to be willing to personally apologize to a few mischievous foreign children is truly shocking. Some people may not believe it is true. Look at our socialites replying to marriage proposals, they still need to hire a secretary to write the letter. How much more so a national leader managing countless affairs every day? Where would they have the free time and inclination to care about transactions (that have anything to do with dignity or credit)? Fundamentally, our children would never dare to boldly try to test the limits of a powerful figure. Perhaps it is possible, but only if they first prepare a sum of (bribes) and then write to purchase (children's airplanes). Only in this way would they have the hope of receiving a reply that would be (published in its entirety) in the newspaper!</p>
<p>However, to return to the subject, the sage has already said, "If a person is without trustworthiness, I do not know what he can do. A large cart without a yoke and a small cart without a crossbar will not work." Shang Yang, with great fanfare, ordered the people to move the wood from the south gate to the north gate and rewarded them with a large sum of money, only to establish the credit of (the law being followed when it is announced). This proves that (establishing oneself and the nation, credit is fundamental) is indeed a golden rule. Unfortunately, our Young Marshal Zhang's (giving foreigners whatever they want) creed cannot be denied. He did indeed establish credit with foreigners, but the subsequent two telegrams of (defending the border with blood and life) and (resolutely resisting to the death even with one gun and one bullet remaining) when Jehol was invaded seem to show that he was not afraid to casually lie to his own people. To the point that the sage scolded him as (I do not know what he can do). The most annoying thing is that, with an imperial decree, he once telegraphed his resignation, and after arriving in Shanghai, his confidants made a statement saying that Zhang had decided to leave Shanghai with his family for Europe and America in the short term. This was evidenced by the various shipping companies competing to attract his business. However, there were also rumors that he was still reluctant to leave (according to the confidant's statement on the 18th). This is truly embarrassing. However, it is not good to blame him. The ignorant people can only blame the fact that the checks issued by the great men have also been affected by the gloomy world situation, and even if they are discounted, they cannot be circulated.</p>

<p>Shop Clerk Communications</p>
<h3>Preventing Stock Shortages in Stores</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I am a salesperson (commonly known as a clerk), and my monthly salary is eighteen dollars. Others, besides their regular salary, perhaps have commissions, raises, bonuses, and other extra income. But what about us? Don't even mention extra income; it's already difficult to get the full regular salary! Why is that? Taking leave (whether for weddings, funerals, or illness) results in salary deductions; making mistakes on invoices means paying compensation. I wouldn't even bother about these, because taking leave means you weren't doing any work, and invoice errors are due to your own negligence. The most unjust thing is having to pay compensation for missing stock!</p>
<p>Sir, do you know? All our colleagues, as long as they are salespeople, are responsible for managing the stock. In departments with many items, each person has to manage over a hundred kinds. As long as there is a shortage, you must compensate for the full amount. The reason given is to prevent us from cheating or stealing. But how can we cheat? The goods sold are taken by trainees to wrapping staff, who verify them before wrapping. The invoices are also checked by auditors. Stock is counted and recorded every night, and accountants come to verify it the next day. At the end of each month, auditors conduct a major stocktake. So there is fundamentally no way to cheat. How can we steal? Upon entering the store, no personal belongings can be brought in. If you have any, you must deposit them at the staff storage area. When taking them out, they are inspected by the administrative staff. So, even with extraordinary abilities, there is no way to steal, right?</p>
<p>The reasons for stock shortages are nothing more than two types. One is the visits of thief "uncles," who take advantage of our busy and inattentive moments to display their "three-hand" skills, taking without asking. The other is errors in deliveries from the factory or shortages within the packages. However, the manager says, "Salespeople should have eyes everywhere and ears in all directions. If thief uncles steal, it means one of the directions wasn't watched. Not watching means weak ability. Those with weak abilities should not only pay compensation but should also not be given food." Factory delivery errors and shortages are due to errors in one's own procedures. Why not unpack and count each item? So this kind of error is a manifestation of laziness. People with laziness should not be kept on." Sir, when one person is serving seven or eight customers, on the one hand, they have to serve them attentively, and on the other hand, they have to watch in all directions to prevent thief uncles from using their skills. In reality, it is impossible to do. Counting each item in the package is also practically impossible. Imagine, for any type of goods, the factory sends at least three to five hundred dozens (because wholesale goods are also shipped from the retail department, so they must come in large quantities). If each dozen has to be unpacked and counted, unless one does nothing else all day, how can it be done? Alas! Colleagues sometimes have to pay twenty or thirty dollars in compensation for missing stock, working a whole month and still having to pay some extra. However, under the pressure of losing our jobs, no one dares to say no to the manager's official rhetoric. If there is anything, it is only to complain to you, sir. I wonder if you would be willing to shout out for us, the "bitter clerks"? I respectfully request your</p>
<p>Peace,</p>
<p>Clerk Qiu Chunzhong</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The above is Mr. Qiu's original letter. We have not modified a single word. Judging from the writing style of this letter, he is at least a high school graduate. And a top-notch graduate at that! He is now a clerk, busy all day long, and the price is only eighteen good silver dollars per month. This is somewhat meager. As for the management methods of this store, some are certainly good, but some places are too harsh. Deducting salary for leave is correct in principle, but it is truly unreasonable to deduct salary for leave due to weddings, funerals, or illness. Paying compensation for incorrect invoices is even more unquestionable. However, since the store employs auditors, it seems that the auditors should bear at least half of the responsibility. As for the errors that the auditors find, they can be passed on to the customers without having to pay compensation. Even if some warning is necessary, it may as well be recorded daily and used as a basis for evaluation. As for the shortage of goods in the store, it is indeed a serious issue. No one can say the manager is wrong in handling it seriously. However, holding the clerks fully responsible is certainly possible in stores with slow business and many employees. It is difficult for the store where Mr. Qiu works. We know that forcing people to do what is difficult is impossible. In such cases, it seems necessary to add some personnel to each department to specifically manage this matter.</p>

<h3>Fleeting Time in a Dream (Serial 9)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>("So, unless you treat Chao You to a meal today and he returns the favor tomorrow, you'll have nothing to talk about with him from the day after tomorrow!") While Wu Yi was laughing so hard he couldn't catch his breath, Zhao Qianli continued to deliver his insightful and cutting remarks. ("For example, for those of us who work for newspapers, because of our position, people often need to use you. So Zhang San, Li Si, and others all come together to befriend you. They treat you to dinner today and to the theater tomorrow, fawning over you like filial sons and obedient grandsons. But once you leave the newspaper, I dare to say dogmatically that even if you happen to bump into them in a restaurant, they will swear that they will never pay for you!")</p>
<p>That evening, Wu Yi began to get to know a friend who was much older than him and had much more experience than him.</p>
<p>("Ah, Yu Lin!") The next morning, Wu Yi, feeling very happy after listening to Zhao Qianli's profound and brilliant remarks the night before, rushed to Wang Yulin's law firm to find him. The two old classmates, after reuniting after a long separation, busily sat on a large sofa and told each other their past experiences very sincerely. As a result, Wu Yi was very relieved to know that his old classmate had specifically written to find him to renew their old friendship and not to ask him to publish any publicity news.</p>
<p>("It's very lonely in Shanghai without a woman!") In the past two years, Wang Yulin had substantially earned a Bachelor of Laws degree, but spiritually, he had fully experienced the pain of being jilted. He told Wu Yi all about this matter. Then, he announced his future policy, ("But it's also very interesting to have a few good friends to hang out with! I recently met a friend, a very special one, a retired actor! Haha! Old Wu! Don't look down on him! He does have a very complete artistic mind, absolutely different from other actors! Now, he wants to open a record company and plans to invite a few people to invest. I've already agreed. Old Wu! You might as well join in a few shares. When you're free, go and sit there. It's no less fun than starting a club. And I tell you, he can often invite some male and female actors to sing. That's not lonely!")</p>
<p>Wang Yulin has always been a theater fan. He felt that opening a record company with others was more interesting than anything else, so he tried his best to encourage Wu Yi to join him. Coincidentally, a major change had recently occurred in Wu Yi's environment, and he was feeling too lonely and had no place to relieve his boredom. Hearing him say this, he agreed!</p>
<p>("But what's that friend's name?") Finally, Wu Yi asked this.</p>
<p>("Lin Daping!")</p>
<p>("Ah! Is it him? Isn't he with a very popular actress named (Mai E)?") Wu Yi was about to use his experience as a newspaper editor for several years to publish a short biography of Lin Daping when someone suddenly knocked lightly on the door. Wang Yulin said, "Come in," and immediately a person wearing a very fancy suit, with very white skin, a very large nose, a very short stature, and a very dignified air, stepped in.</p>

<p>Film Supplement</p>
<h3>The Cry of (City Lights)</h3>
<p>— Jia Yan</p>
<p>The important components of drama and film are (implication). Without implication, a film, even if it has good acting, is just an art flower that blooms in the morning and withers in the evening. A drama with good performance and strong implication has permanence. City Lights has profound implications! Equalization of land ownership.</p>
<p>The city's buildings are made by those who have obligations but no rights. The city's civilization is enjoyed by those who have rights but no obligations. After the city develops, the soaring prices and the high cost of real estate drive the city's builders, the poor workers, out of the city. And those who enjoy the city, the ladies and gentlemen, take everything for themselves. The poor workers are not willing to leave the city where they have contributed their blood and sweat. But how can they, (it is not easy to live in the city!)? That is the cry of the city lights!</p>
<p>If the gentlemen who have more than a dozen small houses, villas, and mansions and are unable to be in several places every night would think of the poor workers who have no place to stand. If the young masters who wear imported wool vests and otter skin coats worth hundreds of dollars and sneeze by the stove would think of the poor bones whose tattered quilts are still in the pawnshop and have not been redeemed. If the rich men who go to banquets every day and suffer from indigestion, stomach problems, and toothaches would think of the hungry ghosts who eat congee and rice. If the big men who have too many concubines and suffer from neurasthenia would think of the poor ghosts who starve their wives to death, then it would be good. Class conflicts can be resolved. The terror of communism can be delayed by at least fifty years. Unfortunately, the rich and powerful gentlemen have not thought of this! Too many people are concerned only with their own well-being. Too few people are concerned with the well-being of the masses. They are too focused on their own interests. They have forgotten that it is the responsibility of every rich and powerful gentleman to improve society, seek happiness for the masses, and alleviate the suffering of the people. And only they have this power! Otherwise, the current situation of unequal wealth and extreme differences in suffering will become more prominent, the conflict between rich and poor will become more intense, and it will inevitably lead to a path of mutual destruction!</p>
<p>Although there are many rich and benevolent philanthropists and great living Buddhas in the city, it always feels like a drop in the bucket and does not help much. Charitable undertakings must use scientific methods to have a widespread effect. Giving money on the street to beggars who make a living by kowtowing only increases their dependence. Providing congee and rice can only save them for a while, not for a lifetime. The most complete, most economical, and most permanent charitable undertaking is to revive factories. Because of the Japanese bombing and the impact of the recession, many factories have closed down. Workers are terribly unemployed. It must be known that if factories are not reopened and rebuilt, the wealthy will only earn less money for one day. But the workers will eat less food for one day. The wealthy are afraid of not making money, so they dare not open factories. Instead, they are willing to deposit interest in foreign banks or engage in real estate, raise land prices, and increase the burden of rent on the poor, implementing the wealth-generating technique of (eating human flesh by exploiting the land)! They all want to make money. Why not engage in enterprises that benefit the people instead of doing wealth management that harms others and benefits themselves? If the wealthy are willing to invest in factories, not only can domestic industry be developed, but the poor can also have the opportunity to support themselves. If a family is well-fed and clothed, they will naturally not do anything wrong. That is truly a good thing that will benefit future generations and accumulate immeasurable merit!</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Review of (A Spray of Plum Blossoms)</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>(A Spray of Plum Blossoms) has been screened at (Central) before and is now showing at West Sea. Not many seats are taken.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, there are many absurdities in this film. Let me point them out for the public to comment on!</p>
<p>Bai Lede is a powder-puff general and a despicable villain. Since Hu Lunting looked down on him even at school, how could he associate with him? Moreover, upon arriving at someone's house, he peeped into their private quarters and flirted with the ladies of the household. Hu Lunting knew very well about this kind of despicable behavior. Why, when he was leaving, did he entrust his sister to the care of such a person?</p>
<p>Second, Hu Lizhu looked down on Bai Lede from the start. Later, she discovered Bai Lede's plot to harm her brother. But in the end, Lizhu still married him. I suppose this is also called (a karmic relationship)?</p>
<p>Third, it is too far-fetched for a warlord's daughter to be a bodyguard.</p>
<p>There are many other laughable points, but I cannot list them all one by one. However, the actors are all very accomplished. Except for Wang Cilong's winking, which was slightly over the top, Ruan Lingyu's performance as Lizhu was impeccable from beginning to end. Also, the cinematography is not bad. Several artistic landscapes are very outstanding. Therefore, I give this film the overall rating of (good actors, poor director).</p>
<h3>Review of (Thoughtful and Meticulous)</h3>
<p>— Mei Cun</p>
<p>When I watch foreign films, I often feel that the plot is not tight enough and I don't understand it. In (Thoughtful and Meticulous), the plot is very coherent. Even without reading the synopsis, one can understand the content. Therefore, the director of the film has avoided the problem of looseness in the arrangement of the plot.</p>
<p>The male lead, James Dunn, plays the young lawyer, Peer. Speaking from his position as the main actor, he can only be described as average and competent, without amazing performances. The female lead, Busi Marulan, plays the lady, Helen. I heard that it was her first time on camera. Her attitude is leisurely and elegant, which is truly rare. Regarding her love for the two children left by her sister, her expression of compassion in the scene where Tomman cries out in shock is just right. The two children, played by Pest De Field and Georgia Anisner, are both very good. Their natural and innocent attitude is very brilliant. It can be said that they are pleasing in every scene and are the most colorful part of the whole play.</p>
<p>The scene where Quilly escapes from the window and gathers hundreds of children to surround Bohr's residence is very cleverly interspersed and is the most exciting part of the whole play. Other things, like the situation in the department store, are simple and divided into scenes to meet the needs and do not feel any trouble, which is also satisfactory.</p>
<p>In terms of the plot, it was originally a romantic film, but there is also a deep portrayal of parents' love for their children. Therefore, it can be said that it is (thoughtful and meticulous) not only in terms of love between men and women, but also in terms of parents' love for their children and children's love for their parents. The title of this film is a wonderful blend of the theme and the plot.</p>
<h3>Bernard Shaw's Satire on Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Hua Ming</p>
<p>When the Irish satirist Bernard Shaw traveled around the world and passed through the United States, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences in Hollywood specially contacted Mr. Shaw by long-distance telephone and asked him to go to Hollywood to shoot one or two short films. Mr. Shaw replied in the phone, "I have declined lectures, let alone shooting films?" Later, RKO, Paramount, and Warner Brothers-First National three companies jointly sent representatives to negotiate with Mr. Shaw in person, asking Mr. Shaw to shoot at least a short segment of a short film. Mr. Shaw replied with a smile, "Shaw is old. If he were young and dashing, he would definitely come to win the name of a handsome man. There is no need for your invitation." The representatives still pleaded earnestly. Mr. Shaw also said, "Shaw loves money so much that he is afraid that if he goes to Hollywood, he will not be willing to leave even if he is driven away." A few words scold the general money-grubber.</p>
<p>Several years ago, Samuel Goldwyn, the owner of MGM, traveled to Europe. When he arrived in England, he asked Bernard Shaw to write a script and stated that he was willing to pay a lot of money. Bernard Shaw replied, "Shaw only knows money and does not know art. Mr. Goldwyn is misled by my false reputation." Goldwyn retreated silently.</p>
<p>Bernard Shaw has always been dissatisfied with the so-called (Dollar Man) of the Americans, and especially hates the Hollywood figures who rely on wealth to bully others. Therefore, although there are many dramas in his writings, he has never sold the filming rights to Hollywood for the sake of money.</p>
<p>A Scene from Tianyi's New Film (Pursuit)</p>
<h3>Filming Location and Date of (Honeymoon on a Desert Island)</h3>
<p>— Moke</p>
<p>Wu Suxin, who has not been seen on the screen for a long time, since her husband Zhang Huimin changed the Huaju Company to Huimin Company, (Honeymoon on a Desert Island), which is a film following (The Glorious History of the 19th Route Army), has been preparing for a long time, and the interior scenes have already been filmed. It was originally scheduled to take the main characters to Siam on the 7th</p>
<h3>Hong Shen Will Return to the Film Scene Zhao Peng</h3>
<p>The playwright Hong Shen, who has given up directing since directing the play (Female Secretary), has recently accepted the invitation of Zhang Shichuan of the Mingxing Film Company and will return to the film scene to direct a new film (The Iron Plate Red Shadow Record), which will take the tyranny of Sichuan warlords as its theme and show the warlords' harm to the country. Chen Ningqiu and Ms. Wang Ying have been selected to play the male and female leads. The assistant directors Gao Lihen and Shen Xiling will start filming next week. Chen Ningqiu is a former member of the Nanguo Drama Club. In (Returning South II), her performance was highly praised by people in the society. I think she will definitely achieve good results on the screen.</p>
<p>to shoot exterior scenes, but Wu Suxin suddenly suffered from a cold. After seeing a doctor, she is now recovering day by day, but she has been instructed by the doctor that she needs to rest for a few days after her illness. Therefore, the date for shooting exterior scenes in Siam has been postponed to the end of this month or early April.</p>
<h3>Ann Harding Will Leave Screen Life</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>In Hollywood, another alarming message has recently been reported, saying that Ann Harding will leave screen life. Her good contract expires in the middle of April this year. Although there is news from RKO that the contract will be renewed for another year starting in April, Ann Harding is wondering if she will be selected to continue, because the company has news of cutting actors. It is said that only those with special success in the past can continue to sign the contract. Unfortunately, after consideration, Ann Harding has not been included among the successful actors.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Red Dust (4)</h3>
<p>— Jack</p>
<p>("Is this how you waste a good evening?") She asked him in a sociable manner, but Niis didn't answer, always looking at his map.</p>
<p>("Is there anything to eat? I'm starving!") the woman complained.</p>
<p>("The kitchen's in the back," he said with a nod.</p>
<p>("When I was in Saigon, they all said I lost weight. Do you think I lost weight?") She stood in front of him after leaving the table. ("I don't care about that," Niis replied flatly. "Please leave!")</p>
<p>("Hey! Yo!") Yeadan walked to the kitchen. ("There's no need to make such a fuss! I can't go home after a few days. If I had to stay for a month, someone would get drunk and cause you to lose sleep. When you entertain the gorillas in the living room, it's okay for them to make a fuss to you.") She said to herself, looking around the kitchen, she saw a box of biscuits. She reached out to pick a cockroach from the top of the box. ("Ha!") she said in jest. ("Why aren't you in my room?")</p>
<p>She went back to the living room with a box of biscuits. But it was empty. A room door was open along the balcony, giving off light. Niis was undressing. Yeadan took out a biscuit and chewed. She looked around, her eyes betraying a vaguely lost look. In the corner, she saw a parrot in a cage.</p>
<p>("Hey, Bali," she said teasingly. "Talk to me! I want to find someone to talk to!") The bird raised a round eye at her, then laughed loudly. Yeadan also burst out laughing miserably and gave a biscuit to the parrot. After that, they became good friends.</p>
<p>Mic saw that she was eloquent but not naive, and over time, he inevitably fell for her natural beauty. When Niis was in a bad mood, he would even protect her.</p>
<p>She arranged everything in the house in an orderly manner. At night, when she played cards with Mic, she couldn't help but often glance at the unmoved Niis, but she didn't go any further to stir up his emotions. She happily handled daily chores. One day, Niis told her impetuously that she could take (Mrs. Parrot), her eyes melted immediately, she didn't know how to thank him, but he walked out of the house without saying a word.</p>
<p>("You know, Mic, I don't want to go back," Yeadan said suddenly enthusiastically. ("No,") she said softly. ("These four weeks have been like (planting fragrance! Exotic fragrance.)</p>
<p>Yeadan saw Niis at the dock. He had come to welcome the new engineers. She shouted to him.</p>
<p>("Are you here to say goodbye to me?") she asked eagerly.</p>
<p>He turned and walked up to her, smiling at her slightly for the first time.</p>
<p>("Goodbye, kid,") he patted her arm. (Unfinished)</p>
