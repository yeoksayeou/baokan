<h3 id="c25">世界軍備縮小日本軍備擴張明 <a href="#c25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>美國總統提倡以英首相軍縮案爲基準。而縮减世界軍備後。世界和平已現一線曙光。糾紛不解之局。似有轉機。和平互讓之議。或可實現。以故當世各國。交相慶幸。大都具有若干誠意。以襄助和平。减少政治危機。俾有助於世界經濟恐慌之轉換也。即對時代開倒車之德國希特勒亦知衆意難違。且顧及其國力。而贊同軍縮提議。獨東方之日本國主義者。迷於太平洋覇權北中國市場獨占之幻夢。以絶對優勢之陸軍。支持其所謂大陸政策。今旣囊括「滿洲。」俯瞰華北。而可稱覇西太平洋矣。然猶以爲未足。以爲須在東方壓倒英美。制服蘇聯。方足以滿足其慾望。解除其政治上及經濟上危機。</p>
<p>溯自華盛頓會議以來。英美日三國海軍協定。日本海軍力除英美兩國而外。堪稱世界獨步。矧英國殖民地遍佈全球。其海軍兵力。萬難集中。新嘉坡軍港縱使築成。僅能爲印度之前衛。香港亦不過澳洲之犄角。非如日本海軍勢力之集中地理上之團結也。至於美國。在太平洋中有力之支撑點。厥爲夏威夷之珍珠港。而馬尼剌距港最近。海程且有四千八百四十海里。關島雖名爲日本門前之一枚爆彈。但以華盛頓條約限制之故。并無堅固之要塞設備。一朝有事。乃爲一未實炸藥之彈殼。絶無爆炸能力。非如日本有横須賀吳·佐世保。三軍港之互相聯結。呼應靈活也。况美國旣須防守大西洋。又必保持巴拿馬之海運。其軍力巳分。勢力自散。日本雖在表面上對英美海軍比率爲十·十·六。其實彼仍處優勢也。且自倫敦海軍條約成立日本海軍對英美比已見增高。尤其日補助艦艇。美國尙未達到倫敦條約所規定之數字蓋經濟恐慌之程度加深。美國殊不願徒事不生產之軍備擴張以自蝕其國力而日本則反是。重輕巡洋艦。旣與美國等量齊觀。潛水艦艇且駕英美而上之其艦型新。速率快。備砲射程遠。續航力亦較長。然而日本猶以爲不能支配東亞全局。未足以制服美國對空軍之襲擊。不能不懷絶大恐懼是以在普通協定以外。另提所謂特别協定。區分世界爲大西洋組太平洋組歐洲組南美組藉以分散英美之實力。引開列强之注視。而集中日本之海軍兵力</p>
<p>就表面觀察。日本似巳贊同美總統之和平提議。實則彼以「軍隊爲警察活動」作面具而侵襲津東。以「自衛權之發動」而强掠東北。亞大陸已占絶對優勢。其陸軍兵力之强逈非其他各國所能企及。矧又掩有東北四省之天然富源。設使「日滿經濟聯盟」完全形成。則北拒蘇聯。東却美國。已具穏固之基礎。不畏平時無充分之原料供給。又何懼時有匱乏之虞。</p>
<p>所最不放心而日夜籌劃者。第一爲北美合衆國之大艦大砲主義。在平時日本財力不及。如競爭過激。勢必處於劣敗地位。且巨艦任重致遠。確便於遠洋航行。日本逼取守勢。殊爲不利。第二美國飛機格外發逹。蘇聯航空。尤據優勢。而航空母艦艦係屬海上怪物。倘其搭載飛機。遠渡太平洋以襲擊其重要都</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>市。則東京大阪。皆將不免感巨大之威脅。於是彼乃發爲軍備縮小之具體提案。第一在乎縮小主力艦至於二萬五千噸。重巡洋艦縮至八千噸。輕巡洋艦至六千噸以減輕美國之攻擊力。第二提議全體廢止航空母艦且倡議禁止一切艦艇有搭載飛行機之裝備。如是則日本可以解除被飛機轟炸之威脅並得徐行準備。利用地勢以控制遠東。使美國對東方海上交通。仰給日本鼻息。而市塲開拓之實。權乃操諸日人。日本於此。得享軍備縮小之名。有擴充軍備之實。此美國之所以堅决主張維持華盛頓條約而反對日本之新提案也。</p>

<p>聯美與取銷英日商約呼聲</p>
<p>英日談判瓜分市塲</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日午後下院辯論如火箭四射之日本對外貿易之活動、諸議員均以日本極廉價之貨物侵奪英國市塲爲言、保守黨議員里凡宣稱、帝國十三區之貿易、日本佔甚優勝之地位、且方在步步增高中、倘不能立即商妥英日協定、則有限制日貨入英數量之必要云、保守黨議員海末斯萊稱、此非商業競爭問題、實爲一種經濟侵略之國家信仰、用種種工具、如通貨膨脹盜用商標之類、以求執世界市場之牛耳、而爲趨向主宰東方之一種步驟、不列顚與其自治領及印度急當更密切合作、繼與如法比意等國締結協定、分握殖民地之市場、並當與美國作更密切之聯絡云、海外貿易部次官柯爾維爾代政府答稱、日本工値低廉、此大足增長其竸爭力、但日本之組織及其有效率的出產、仍有需乎津貼、而近今日金匯價之大落、亦使日商佔極大之便利、目前尙未獲有證據、知其所津貼之數、等於日貨售價與英貨售價相差之數、英貨所暢銷之地、日貨運　日增月盛、巳引起實施抵制計畫之需要、此項計畫、或爲征收高稅、或爲限制其入口數量尤其爲歧視行動、如取銷英日商約是也、</p>
<p>今印度政府已通吿日本取銷印日商約矣、此舉使印度政府於該約期滿後得對入口日貨施特别計畫、柯氏旋稱、關于國内市塲、入口稅法曾規定一種機會、使英國實業另得稅則上之保護、至於國外市場、則政府不能取直接行動、任何行動、必須出以條約、自治領因渥太華會議之結果、已使不列顚享有某種優惠特遇、殖民地近多數修正稅則、以裨益英國出口貨、而以棉貨爲主、西非因有國際之義務、不能實施帝國優待、但迄今可貴之蘭開夏市塲、未受日貨競爭之嚴重影響、柯氏又謂競爭今有益轉劇烈之象、該問題之嚴重性質、巳使内國政府審愼將事此爲甚複雜之問題、應整個解决、而不能枝枝節節爲之、商部大臣任錫曼近與日大使談話時、曾說明英政府視題案爲英國實業大困難事件之一、並向日大使建議、今第一步應由英日實業家代表開會、以便互相分配市塲、覆文今正在考慮中、詳情未便發表、任錫曼與日大使會晤時並稱、將由尋常機關通吿日當局、英政府願先行照會、曾予日本以最惠國待遇之西非條約、行將取銷、惟此非僅關一處市塲問題、英政府覺處置此事之最佳辦厥爲兩國政府對各市場努力成一總諒解、柯氏末謂政府將以種種方法利便談判云、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>大阪各紡織業者以前年以來、因原棉與匯市跌落、輸出增加、故有相當之增收、惟自日印條約廢棄後、海外市塲之前途、即須警戒、本期决算東洋紡仍爲一成八分、鐘紡·大日本紡·日淸紡·岸和田紡·錦華紗等、均增加紅利一分、惟天滿紡則减以警戒关途、（三日電通電）</p>

<p>（柏林）四國公約之簽訂、忽於最後五分鐘内、因法意兩國之要求、將草約之内容更改而　延期、德國外交界得此消息、均感極度之失望、此事法國方面雖在其半官式宣言中頗多影射之語、然此最近之稽延、實與德國毫無關係故德國半官式外交通訊報載法國所受之困難、實由於其對於小協約諸國之要求已經讓步、以致公約中須明白承認此後條約修改之不可能、即在　聯會章範圍以内者、亦不得稍事修正、如此則歐洲現有之局勢、將永久加以維持、此實與意相墨索里尼倡議締結公約之原意、大相逕庭也、外交通訊復稱、法國今日已逹兩道分歧之交點、勢必須擇其一而行之、或依從小協約國自私之要求、或爲歐洲全部之和平合作着想、勢難長此依違兩可、（三日國民電）</p>

<p>羅馬巴黎淸議報駐羅馬通信員、爲文論四强條約、謂該約之所以暫未簽畫草押者、並非由於純粹形式上問題、其主要點、仍因第三條有各種不同之提案、第一種草案、主張四强相互分期逐漸實行裁軍、第二種草案、則規定德國不獨應分期實行本國之裁軍、並應與其他各國同意對每一簽字國、採取有益之辦法、巴黎寄與小恊商各國者、即爲此第二種提案、但此項條欵、使德國不能以完全平等地位與各國簽字、且使他國對德國之裁軍進行、及實際狀况、有權監察、恐德國以此爲理由、拒絶承認耳、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>法認爲並不影響楊格計劃</p>
<p>路透二日柏林電德國緩付長期短期外債之展期辦法、不久可望宣佈、大約其宣佈期在耶穌降靈節後、此說係德國國家銀行總裁沙赫特今日在此對外國新聞記者所發表者、外國銀行家在柏林之會議今日閉幕、沙赫特說明此會之意義、謂德國國家銀行巳切實决定不許其所存外幣準備金再行縮減、而出入口之尋常信用必須維持、德國願意償付債欵、但必須有賺錢付債之機會、德國貨幣之穏定、在任何環境内必須保持云、沙赫特關於緩付債欵之言論、其關係之重要、可於德國本年内所須償付之債額見之、查德債總額約爲二○·○○○·○○○·○○○馬克、其本年到期應付之數、爲六五·○○○·○○○鎊、欠美債欵最鉅·計八·○一六·○○○·○○○馬克荷蘭次之、計三·四二七·○○○·○○○馬克、再次爲英國計二·二三一·○○○·○○○馬克、目前困難、由於德國貿易之大没落、國家銀行鈔票準備金僅有百分之八·三、而法定之最低準備數則爲百分之四十、沙赫特雖未明言展期緩付、但聞其言者、則咸作此解釋、英美等外國銀行家會議考慮德國外債償還事宜後、今日一致通過一文、對於德國國家銀行逐漸增置現金與外幣準備金之需要、表示同意、並對於德國對外貿易盈餘减少、不敷還債之情形、承認其有考慮如何保護並擴大德國外匯準備金之必要、此文並宣佈代表長期債權人之永遠小團體將與德國國家銀行時常接洽、而短期債權人亦將有固定委員會與該銀行接觸、此文末謂國際大債欵僅可由貨物之流通與還債辦法之整理而解决之、確信世界經濟大會最大目的之一、將在便利德國轉運問題之迅速的與永遠的解决云、</p>
<p>路透二日柏林電衆料下星期必宣佈一種緩付債欵之辦法、但非總緩付或謂沙赫特將宣佈展緩付本、但將勉力以外幣償付一部份利息、而以必須用於德國之馬克償付其餘利息、至於道威斯與楊格借欵之償付、則目前不受影響、參加銀行家會議之美代表已聲明如沙赫特宣佈總緩付、、則美國之執有債劵者準備對於不付債劵之德商行没收其在美之任何資產云</p>
<p>路透二日巴黎電此間官塲聞德國國家銀行總裁沙赫特之言論後、無甚表示、、以爲此言僅指德政府所欠之私人債務而言、並不涉及楊格計畫之債劵、</p>
<p>路透三日柏林電德國報紙評論將行宣佈之緩付債欵辦法、咸謂國家銀行總裁沙赫特所豫示之計畫、爲保護債權人與債務人計、實屬絶對必要必須實施直至與債權人議定德國所可容受之辦法而後已、波爾森報稱關於德國付債能力之最後决定、屬諸贳世界經濟大會、如大會適當支配國際貿易關係、則其决議爲積極的、但若各國政治家不以建設性質之政策、代替現行政策、則其决議爲消極的云</p>

<p>據甘氏談、地方自治之重要、盡人知之、內政部主辦以來、各省均巳切實遵辦、雖尙未克底於成、但各省均獲得相當成績、據內部調查所得各省地方自治成績報吿、以浙江省爲最佳、湖北次之、蘇省則因種種困難、成績較少、浙江省辦理地方自治、業巳完成什之七八、依照中央所頒佈法令、各省地方須於民國二十三年完成、能否如期一一完成現尙未能斷定云、</p>

<p>籌謀救濟邵氏繼謂本人此次赴陜、最大之任務在於救災、本人之遲遲尙未啓行者即因忙於接洽救濟事宜也、中央黨部前曾撥發二萬元、作爲救濟陜災之用、現决再撥五萬元、以備購買種子、救濟陜災本人曾與滬上各慈善團體接洽、請予救濟各慈善團體、亦鑒於陜西之災情重大刻正積極籌劃、設法救濟、今日（三日）在引翔鄕舉行之金樽香檳賽、所得佣金、原定作爲救濟豫皖鄂三省災區之用、現决提出一部份救陜災、、至於確數則尙未定、、</p>

<p>成立傾銷貨物審查委員會</p>
<p>美受日傾銷亦將徵傾銷稅</p>
<p>國聞社云、日貨向我傾銷、謀抵制我之拒貨運動影響我實業前途綦鉅、財政實業兩部、於上月動議征收傾銷稅、以維國貨市塲、業巳成立審查委員會、同時英國方面亦因受日貨傾銷影響、準備此項徵收稅則、茲誌各情如左、</p>

<p>英國殖民地及其商業獨佔市塲、若印度緬甸波斯埃及等國、最近亦受日貨傾銷之患、於英貨市塲、頗有影響、故英國近與我國採同樣政策、準備徵收傾銷稅、我國當局業已向英徵詢施行方法、俾作借鏡、</p>

<p>昨據熟悉國際經濟現狀者談、傾銷政策、爲生產過剩所逼成之必然之果、徵收傾銷稅、雖爲補救辦法、然根本問題尙繫於世界繁榮之恢復國外、往往有若干廠商因鑒於停工或減工以後、其開支並不節省、反致工人有失業之　、故一方面爲顧全工人生計起見、乃製造輕工業施行傾銷、最近市上、每見小販、以輕質皮球黃色皮球形若汽球之物幾於遍市皆是、考其價値、祇須一二角小洋、此種貨物、即是傾銷品之一種也云云、</p>

<p>濟南萬君來信</p>
<p>我自幼便站在社會的醜惡而卑汚的一面，進一步講，人世間的不良現象，天天向着我的脆弱的腦中灌注；更不幸自己的家庭又日益衰落，母親的漸漸瘦削，漸漸陰　，深深地染化了我的内心，於是我喪失了活潑和勇敢，遇着了外界的壓力，便只有用忍耐和痛苦應戰，因而又成立了一個疑懼的根蒂在我的内心；更不幸許多人所比擬爲洪水猛獸般的匪患，又撕破了我的本就殘餘的家庭，母親便成了這次大刦的犧牲者！祖母　寄泊在故鄕裏的親戚家，妻寄泊在她的娘家，我便小艇似地浮蕩在茫茫的大海中，今天是繫住在這個孤島之旁，說不定夜來風起，明早醒來時，已在另一個什麽處所了，！不至於沉　便是無上幸福。我没曾讀過很多的書。更没有什麽專門智　，雖然也曾在象牙之塔裹混過好幾年（象牙塔，此處比擬爲學府而且是中等學府）。</p>
<p>介紹吿終，丨恕我只能給先生們以一個淡漠　　響！</p>
<p>我對於人類，除天眞的孩童們以外，無論男性或女性總不敢深信其心是純潔的，其思想是坦直的，丨尤其是現代中國的官僚政客和許多人所駡爲Ｘ棍的。</p>
<p>我對社會，老感覺得是一個深黑的洞潭，或者不如說，是一個糞窖。什麽地方都只有醜惡和腥臭。</p>
<p>縮小一點範圍。我對於中國，只感到絶望。因爲我斷定中國人的心都是自私自利到了尖點的。毫不知廉恥，毫不知慈愛，尤其是發玩弄小奸巧，愛欺侮弱者，受獻媚强者，愛說大話，偏偏不愛眞實地作一件小事，這樣的民族，我只感到絶望，連一線希望之光也閃滅了。我有時候這樣想：倘若眼前有一個人，眞能一點也不卑汚奸巧，而且只有一顆熱烈的心，愛護一切人的心，扶助一切人的心，那可定會倒在他的懷裏痛哭一塲感謝他給了一個理想的眞人類我看。</p>
<p>總之，我的眼睛，似乎是蒙上了一層灰暗的網絲。</p>
<p>我的内心，此刻最强烈的要求，是「要怎樣才可以貢獻我個人的一點力量於社會於人羣」？因爲此刻的我，還在充當一個小小書記，實在還没有眞實的職業</p>
<p>我想過（此刻還在想），我最好是投考什麽地方的屯墾科，畢業後到近於原始人類的西北邊塞去，那裏可以自耕自食，可以忘記以前的一切，可以開始另一人生的樂趣。</p>
<p>亂雜地寫很没頭緖，且讓我自己整理出我的問題來吧！</p>
<p>㈠社會和人類是醜惡而卑汚的或者不然我對於社會和人類的認識，是整個的抑片面的？㈡人生是快樂的抑痛苦的？要取得快樂該有什麽方法？</p>
<p>㈢尋求職業，該以什麽爲準則目下最有利益於社會於人羣的工作是些什麽？</p>
<p>這些問題，或許是値不得問的，但在我是急於要解决的一些痛苦；先生們就專取這點而賜以麻煩的答覆吧！</p>
<p>在答覆以外，如蒙先生們介紹一些可以對症下藥的書籍呌我去買來閱讀，因更獲得澈底的解决，那便最好不過。（復信明日登出）</p>

<p>高欄陳陵個中老手、預賽成績十七秒四、决賽可穩得第一、西捕足球名將派克（德）、亦有十七秒八之功夫、足與陳陵决戰、俄羅斯三鐵大五密洛諾夫亦不弱、</p>

<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>枇杷黃，大少藏，娘姨忙。這九字歌謠不知誰做的，誰是絶妙好詞，大有流傳的價値。杜牧的「六王畢，四海一；蜀山兀，阿房出；」還不及「枇杷黃」三句的自然而有興趣。有人說；「描寫倡門，何必用倡門，所以，「這九字歌謠，妙在用「枇杷黃」起興」。</p>
<p>沈石田的友人贈送枇杷，誤書爲琵琶，石田答書云；「承惠琵琶，開奩駭甚；聽之無聲，食之有味。乃知，古來司馬淚於潯陽，明妃怨於塞上，皆爲一啖之所需耳」。石田老人書中語，極盡幽默之致。按琵琶一名枇杷，古時本可通用；但寫琵琶作枇杷，則可，寫枇杷作琵琶則不可，石田老人的謔語，不可云虐。</p>
<p>鷄肋編載廣州有無核枇杷，可見無核枇杷，並非人欄罕有之種。秀水朱竹坨先生與道士友善，道院中有枇杷二株，熟時，摘果餉朱，俱係無核。朱問道士種植法。道士說；「日仙種」。朱不信。素知道士喜啖蒸豚，朱邀道士飲，命僕人購一豚蹄　，故意令道士見；無多時刻，豚蹄已熟，供各客時，肉香四溢，味尤可口。道士問朱；「怎樣的一燒便熟」、？朱說；「我有頃刻燒熟豚蹄法」。道士請傳授此法。朱云；「請把種植無核枇杷法，彼此交換」道士云；「容易，容易，花開時，鑷去中心一鬚，結果便無核；我已傳授你了，請把頃刻燒熟豚蹄法授我」。朱云；「僕人所購的豚蹄，尙未付煮，恰才所吃的還是隔夕燒熟的」。說罷，主賓拊掌大突</p>
<h3 id="c228">說狗 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 君惕</p>
<p>差不多每個人家，都養着一條狗，或兩三條狗。除去外國女人，作爲玩物，或有其他需用外，大都是用爲看家守夜的。</p>
<p>論到狗的責任，丨看家守夜丨也很不小，但它却未嘗溺職，第一，他白天看門，或夜裏守夜，聽到敲門，便汪汪亂呌，它雖不枕戈，却能待命。第二，它在一個人家内，决不會聽這個人的嗾使，去咬另一個人。第三，它聽到同類的呼聲，除非被練子繫着，或被籠子大門關着，它必定奔出去帮助它。即使不能出去，也要狂跳亂呌，遙爲聲援。而且是熱誠的聲援。</p>
<p>於此，我們知道狗雖是低級動物，但它忠於主人，忠於責任，且又富於互助精神。</p>
<p>我們號稱萬物之靈的人，照理說，應當比它高得多。最低的限度，也須和它一樣，誰知反不及它。有許多人，他的責任，與狗相等，是看門守夜的。但他聽到敲門，不則一聲。看見生人，竟似相熟，夾着尾巴向後轉了。然而他在一家之内，反能聽人指揮，去亂咬人，聲勢兇到極點，却像一隻瘋狗，現在給人家由大門外，追到牆角，雖然嘴裏呌着，却不敢反噬一下。他們的同類，丨世界上萬物之靈的人，丨並没有練子繫着，也没有籠子和大門關着，雖有幾個在門裏呌兩聲，丨並不是誠意的聲援，丨且始終不肯出來跳幾下，咬幾口。</p>
<p>這許多人我們知道他是不忠於主人不忠於責任，對於同類，也没有互助的精神。他們旣不能等於狗，或許還不及狗。所以現在我們中國，不一定需要人，却不可没有狗；不可没有精誠，親愛忠勇互助的狗丨</p>

<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>「飯後一支烟，賽過活神仙；」喜吸香烟的人們，當然有這般雍容的態度。其實在酒後茶餘，早起夜眠，也都是吸烟最上勁的當兒；眞是「一支在手，栩栩欲仙。」</p>
<p>在下素不吸烟，無論如何上品的香烟，都是莫明其妙，不敢沾唇，可謂與烟無緣。但說是無緣却似有緣；因爲你在公共塲所，總是香烟繚繞，把你困在烟霧的氛圍裏。弄得你頭暈腦脹，無法擺脫。尤其是和朋輩雀戰的時候。他們不斷的抽烟，還把殘餘的香烟頭，　在地上，這種烟尿臭，更覺難聞，有時在下對他們說；你們約我雀戰，無論戰術如何高明，都不足懼。惟有你們聯合，放起「烟幕彈」來，委實有些害怕。說得大家都笑起來！</p>
<p>在下雖不吸烟，但手指裏時常夾着雪茄，這也「耶穌自有道理」。因爲在出外的當兒，人家倘若請你吸香烟，你如拒絶不受，好像不近人情。暗地裏難免要說你是壽頭碼子，連香烟都不會吸。所以在下想了個法兒，就拿起雪茄作「擋駕」之用。於是望之儼然，人家也不會再以香烟奉敬你了。不過這支雪茄，手裏起碼要拿着一星期和兩星期咧。</p>
<p>有等吸香烟朋友，把吸餘烟頭，並不抛棄。先用整支的烟，在桌上輕輕敲了幾下，再將烟頭潤些涎沬接上去。如此接了再吸，吸了再接，永無殘餘。這樣失廢物利用，眞好算是最經濟的吸法。但是那「捉蟋蟀」的窮漢子見了，未免要搖頭嘆息，說毫無生路了，（馬路上拾香烟頭的，術語呌做捉蟋蟀。）</p>
<p>最饒樂趣，要算和情人吸烟，男的吸了，遞給女的，女的吸了，遞給男的，互相呼吸。不過給人家瞧了，總要說你「肉麻當有趣」。</p>
<p>嗜吸烟的人們，身上衣服，總有些被烟灰燒破的痕跡，表示他吸烟的成績，但是你不吸烟的人，人家也會代你留些紀念。一天，在下穿了件簇新的馬褂，到書塲聽書，正襟危坐，好像「神聖不可侵犯」的樣子。不料回到家中，那件馬褂後面，發見了兩個香烟燒洞，說了幾聲可惜之外，没有旁的法兒，這眞是「無妄之災」啊！</p>

<p>厚之坐在公事桌邊，兩隻手按了桌子瞪了兩隻大眼望着人，做出那全身用力的樣子來。積之只好埀了兩手，直挺挺的站子角邊，等候哥哥將話駡完。不過厚之最後的一個滾字，却不是他所能忍受，紅着臉；我也並没有犯什麽重大的錯過，何至於就犯上一個滾字？積之一拍棹子道；我呌你滾，你有我什麽辦法。積之也不再說話。立刻走了出來，回到自己辦公事的屋子裏，取了一張稿紙，怱怱的在棹上寫了一個辭呈道；　　敬呈者積之備位屬員，奉公守法，自信無甚過錯。而局長屢加斥責，不假辭色，反躬自問，其道莫由。或者因積之有因人或事之嫌，乃蹈局長内舉避親之戒，爲抽薪於釜底，遂煑豆而然萁，壯士斷腕，自非得已。積之朿髮讀書，尙知自愛，雅不願以一枝之寄而受三安之寃，特此具呈請免除科員本職，旣保留積之之人格，亦稍釋局長之重負，臨頴不勝惶恐之至敬呈局長。科員甘積之謹呈</p>
<p>積之騰寫好了，交給聽差，讓他送給局長，自己穿上大衣，立刻走出衙門，向回家的路上走來。他到了此時，覺得海闊天空，到什麽地方去都可以，絶不受任何人的拘束。心裏痛快得多了。回到家裏，什麽人也不去理會，很快的就去檢理箱子，綑捲行李。他在屋子裏收拾了有一個鐘頭之久，老媽子進來送開水，才看到這種形狀。也很吃驚的問道；二爺，您這是作什麽？積之微笑道；什麽也不爲。老媽子道；旣然什麽也不爲。您捲起行李，收拾箱子，倒好像有出門的樣子，您是到那兒去？積之笑道；到那兒去嗎？這個連我自己也說不定。老媽子道；說不定到那兒去，爲什麽搬了走？積之笑道；難道這一點，你都不知道，這裏並不是我的家呀！（八九）</p>

<p>（告中山先生）中山先生啊！你離開這個世界，已有八年了，在這八年的距離當中，先生可知道現在我們的中華民國，是怎麽樣了？先生知道嗎？我想，先生一定會毫不遲疑的答道；「現在的中華民國，是已經走上了正軌，並且，也實現了三民主義，五權憲法，建國方略，建國大綱了，國内的軍閥，也打倒了，外患，内爭都滅絶了，不平等條約也廢除了，國家也富有了，民生也不凋敝了，」唉，中山先生啊！你知道這完全是錯誤的，現在的中國，正是在外患緊迫的時候，東北三省，曁熱河全部，都換上了太陽旗，國内的軍閥，將一個錦繡的中國，弄得不成樣子，中山先生啊！你聽了我的話，不覺得悲傷嗎？我想，你一定覺得悲傷的罷，可愛的秋海棠葉，被蟲吃去了一角，這是多麽的不幸啊！（張家駒）</p>

<p>在那繁華的都會中的西面，有一陣悲慘的聲音，從那一間破舊不堪的茅屋裏，鳴咽咽的呻吟著，把那寂靜的魔鬼逐走了。</p>
<p>有一個身穿暗綠的洋服；挺硬的襯衫的少年，寫寫意意的走向前來，經過那屋子的門前，有一個年已半百；面上皺皮如波一般的老婦，從那門前跪在那少年跟向，抓住了他，哭訴著的說；「大少爺呀！請你做做好事；救救窮人，今天我的兒子死了，我們一家老小靠他吃飯，自他死後，我們怎能活命呢？又無安葬的錢，怎能好呢？請大少爺發些慈悲之心，救救窮人罷！」那少年說；「滚蛋！窮鬼！我們這樣的一個闊少，豈能和你們這般窮鬼說話呢？滾！滾！滾！」就拍掉了他褲子上的手印，竟頭也不回的到那跳舞塲中去了。（周錚）</p>
<p>（壓迫）在一個繁華而熱閙的都市裏，那時是正在晨曦初放之際，那都市的東面一間茅屋裏，有一位眉髮雪白的老嫗，旁邊坐著一個年幼的孩子，哇哇哇失要東西吃，可是老嫗兩隻烏油油的眼睛，閃閃的照著那鍋子裏，有没有呀！那裏有呀！老早吃掉了，連半粒米也没有，兩條熱淚從伊兩隻眼池裏，不住的淌下去了。</p>
<p>有一個大腹便便，嘴旁蓄著幾根老鼠鬚，手裏提著一隻皮包，收租人大踏步的向那茅屋裏走來。</p>
<p>進了門，大聲呌道，「這月房費十二元快些拿出來，這月可不能欠了！」</p>
<p>哭訴的說；「大··老爺，救救···狗命罷，連飯也没有，怎麽有雪白的大洋細呢？饒饒狗命罷！」</p>
<p>那收租人兩嘴，如丘陵一般的翹著說；「放屁！不要太嚕　了，快把錢付出來！不行！不行！」</p>
<p>那收租人將老嫗拘到局裏，那苦命的老嫗飽受著鐵窗風味，整天以熱淚洗凈伊那枯燥的面皮。（周錚）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3 id="c233">不要自由 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>許多人，要自由，口口聲聲地，也有不惜將熱血去换取的。但自由是什麽呢？生息在這地球上的東西，怎麽會有自由？便是我們的雙脚，要離開地面都不成功，况且這地球又是怎樣狹小的一部分空間，拿全宇宙的廣大來一想，我們將自愧渺小之不暇，又有什麽臉來喴要什麽自由呢？</p>
<p>我們是什麽自由都不會有的，死是給了致命的威脅，一想到死，什麽價値都完了，還有什麽自由不自由丨要飛我們没有翼翅，要潛我們缺少魚　的鱗甲，跑想起來快不如馬鹿，援木不如猢猻，角力晃如牛，兇猛不如虎狼，貪財不如貪官污吏土豪劣紳，嘿，貪污土劣也是人，我說錯了。</p>
<p>不過我的意思是說，我們天賦的能力不厚，不能想怎樣就做到怎樣，所以自由云云，還以不要爲妙。人類是根本不會有自由的，除非在母腹中未產的胎兒，還有幾分自由可說，同出生到這世上來，自嵋早已不存在了。因爲自由的成立，以生活爲先决條件，現在解决生活的麵包，還是成爲重大問題的時候，談不到自由。</p>
<p>這世界上的人，誰曾有了自由，誰曾有過自由呢？没有的。不過局限於一部分的自由，爲法律所許的自由，那却可以有，譬如信敎自由，言論自由等等，但是這些自由，有了又有什麽關係，况且有許多人自由，便有許多人不自由，自由而可以有抵觸，也不是好東西，比方人民言論自由了，官吏行爲便不自由，人民信敎自由了，傳敎人要强迫你信敎便不自由，那總不大合適。</p>
<p>所以我想喊出不要自由的口號，我們全要合於規律，没有個人的什麽自由，官吏不能自由捕殺人，不能自由搜刮錢財，不能自由違法殃民，人人都不能自由賣國，買日貨，大家不能自由捐助航空救國捐，不能自由買航空建設奬券，不能自由跳舞遊藝救國，這樣中國社會情形，恐怕還可以好起來。我有時眞會想歷來中國是壞於太自由了，人人忘却了是社會的一員而只知道個人。將出現的新社會，一定不容許此種思想感情的。</p>

<p>— 聚仁</p>
<p>很久以前，在一本談物理的書上，看到月經的起源說。我們的老祖宗在洞裏住的時候，夜黑風大。躱着不敢出來。遇到天晴月圓，才出洞疎散疎散，久而久之，影響到女人的月經，跟着月亮的圓缺，非每月行一次不可。花前月下，方有才子佳人的故事，老祖宗成法如此；此姻緣之成就，所以歸功於月下老人也！</p>
<p>不成文的普遍信條，月經屬於不祥　物之類。月經旣行，秤，尺，斗等應用物品絶對不許女人跨過。某車夫因爲車墊給女客污染了，洗滌以後，再燒串紙錠以祓不祥。月經的污血，大槪是毒氣彈，會隨處傳播不祥的。有神秘之諱忌乃有神秘之效用。葡萄牙人所輸入的紅衣砲。明崇禎間已實際在戰事上應用。破紅衣砲的唯一妙物，就是女人的月經布；滿城高掛，砲彈不飛，砲身自裂，相傳效騐如神。月經又可以避雷，某逆婦毆辱翁姑，罪孽通天，遣雷公下凡殛殺。逆婦取穢布蓋頭，雷不敢擊。精神文明的國粹家。救世有心，正可以編著一本月經物理學月經化學，與某院長的佛經並埀不朽。</p>
<p>月經，目可得見，口不可得言。筆更不可得而寫，其勢然也。摩登仕女高跟托托，旗袍飄飄，應樂聲能作狐步之舞。然談及月經，未有不面紅耳赤者。其觀念與燒紙錠祓不祥的車夫並無分别。自五四運動以來，婦女運動喊得振天價響，絲毫没有效果，人不解其故。我說；只要看月經仍保持神秘的意義，即不到城隍廟看密悮拜菩蕯，已可斷定婦女運動的命運了！</p>
<p>前幾天，接到某夫人辦的月刋，署名都是什麽「張黃」夫人，「李朱」太太，主編者也以身作則，掛名ＸＹ夫人。我想那些夫人，亦必贊成月經神秘論月經妙用論的。</p>

<p>外國水手哼着「麗娃栗妲」從一家酒排間裏醉醺醺地走了出來。皮靴零亂地磨擦着士敏土；Ｒｉｋｉｓｈａ！像起誓似地舉起手，三個人軟了骨頭樣地倚來倚去。</p>
<p>七八輛人力車，像潮樣地衝過來。尙未開過「利市」的小三子，因爲攔住路而挨了個巴掌。搶到生意的車夫們，臉上畫上了輕笑；把他們的主雇運到北四川路找「鹹水妹」過夜去了。</p>
<p>一個黑白紅調和得很匀稱的年輕姑娘，臂兒吊在一個老紳士的胳膊上。瞅着那老頭子的小八字鬚，尖起迷人的小嗓子；「小周呀，你答應給我的鑽戒明天定得給我的哪！」有節奏地一同向法國公園走去。</p>
<p>都市，白熱的燈光，照在一個異國飄泊者的身上；一個白俄（十年前他從未做過貪窮的夢；現在，他在睡眠中還夢着彼得堡的富貴）。跟在一雙男妇女的後面喃喃着。二隻角子從那年輕人吃飽了鈔票的皮篋裏掬出來。黑暗中，一個襤褸的吃荒老太婆帶了希冀的苦笑踽踽地追隨上來；</p>
<p>「好先生，好小姐，請打發點啵！」</p>
<p>「什麽緣故呢」，年輕的女人瞅了她身旁的「小寳貝」一眼；「琳琳，我連着看見中國要飯的都討厭，你看！」</p>

<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>江南的春天素稱多雨，往往一落就是七八天。住在上海的人們，平日旣感不到雨的需要，一旦下雨，天氣是那麽陰沉，誰也耐不住悶在狹小的家裏；轲是跑到外面，没有山，没有湖，也没有經雨的嫩綠的葉子，一切都不及晴天好；有時闊人用的汽車從你身旁馳過，你還得帶一身泥污回來。</p>
<p>記得六七年前初來上海讀書的時候，校裏的功課特别忙，往往自修到午後；那年偏又多雨，淅淅瀝瀝，常常打擾我看書的情緒。我雖然不像豈明老人那樣額其齋曰「苦雨」，天天坐在裏面嘘氣，但也的確有些「痛惡而深絶之」的念頭。</p>
<p>可是這種事情也祇在上海才會有。少時留居家鄉，當春雨像鵝毛一般落着的時候，登樓一望，遠處的山色被一片烟雨籠住　　　零的　　　　　　　　雨中的原野新鮮而幽靜，使人不易去懷　而尤其可愛的還是夜間；不知是那一年的春天，我和兩個長工，搖着小船到十里外的一個鎭上去看社戲，完塲已是午夜，歸途遇雨，船在河塘中緩緩前進，燈火暗到辨不出人面，船身擦着河岸的藤草，發出沙沙的聲音；雨打烏篷，，俔悠揚疾徐，如聽音樂，和着長工們士著的歌謠，「河橋風雨夜推篷，」眞夠使人神往。</p>
<p>這幾年投荒到都市，每値雨天，聽着那滯澀枯燥的調子，再回想到故鄉的雨天，眞覺得連雨聲也變了！人事的變遷，更何待說呢！</p>

<p>貓一（續）</p>
<p>獵槍的爆聲把紅蘿蔔鬚震昏了。他以爲那小屋子都炸掉了，等到硝烟散去之後，他看見貓倒在他脚下，用一隻眼睛瞧着他。</p>
<p>半邊貓頭已經轟掉了，血往牛乳杯裏流。</p>
<p>「牠並不像死了的樣子，」紅蘿蔔鬚說，「畜生，便我瞄準並没有瞄差呢。」</p>
<p>他不敢動，貓的一隻眼睛放出黃色的光輝，使他忐忑着。</p>
<p>貓呢，看牠身子在　動，便知道牠還活着，但牠並没有想要掙扎着移動的意思。牠像有意把血滴在牛乳杯裏，並且很留心地不使一滴流在杯外似的。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚屠殺生物並不是第一次。他曾經爲着給自己或别人取樂的緣故，弄死過一些野鳥，家畜，和一匹狗。他知道這事是要怎樣幹，如果那畜生的命結實的話，那便得趕快，興奮起來，暴怒起來，必要的時候，還得和牠肉搏。不然的話，我們便會受着那種無用的惻隱之心的侵襲。我們會變爲怯懦。我們會徒然失掉時間；弄得永遠没有結果。</p>
<p>起初，他還祗給牠一些不大厲害的虐行。隨後便抓着貓尾，用獵槍頭在牠的頸根上打着，他打得那樣猛烈，每一下都像最後一下似的，都像開恩　牠早點死去的那最後一下似的。垂死的貓用着瘋了似的脚在空中抓着，時而縮做一團，時而無聲無息地仲弛開來。</p>
<p>「究竟誰曾告訴過我說貓死的時候會哭呢？」紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>他焦燥起來。這弄得太久了，他把獵槍丢開，用自己的兩手把貓揑住，狂熱着恨不得把指甲揑進貓的肉裏，他咬緊牙關，血脈怒張，盡力絞殺着。</p>
<p>但他自己也弄得喘不過氣來了，他搖幌着，精疲力盡，倒在地上坐着，他的臉碰着貓的臉，他的兩眼和貓的一隻眼睛呆呆地對看着。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚現在睡在他的鐵床上。</p>
<p>他的家人們和聽着訊趕忙跑來的同他家裏有來往的人們都　着身子竄進小屋子裏，參觀完成這齣悲劇的地方。</p>
<p>「啊！」他的母親說，「我用了百倍的氣力才把那弄碎了的貓從他的胸口上奪下。我可以向你們保證他從來没有把我這樣緊緊地抱過的。」</p>
<p>當她對大家叙述着那種野蠻的印象丨這種印象，以後一家子晚上坐着閒談時，會像架空的故事似的丨時，紅蘿蔔鬚却熟睡着在作夢；</p>
<p>他夢見自己沿着一道流水散步，一輪不可避免的明月的光輝在水中閃動着，交叉起來，正像一個在編織東西的婦人手中的長針一樣。</p>
<p>在那捕蝦的小網上面，一塊塊的貓肉隔着那透明的水燦黹爛可見。</p>
<p>一層層的白霧掠着牧塲溜過來，那裏面也許藏着有輕飄的幽靈呢。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚把兩手放在背後，給他們證明没有什麽可怕的。</p>
<p>一條牛走近來，停住脚步　着氣，隨又很快地逃走了，得得的蹄聲震天響着，一會見兒便消失了。</p>
<p>如果那好說話的流水不那樣嘮叨，不那樣喞喞噥噥，不像一羣老太婆聚在一塊似的閙得他難受，那便多麽寗靜啊。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚像要把流水打一下，使它住嘴似的，把捕蝦網的桿子輕輕舉起，於是從蘆　中間湧上了許多大蝦。</p>
<p>蝦不斷地增加着，端端正正的，滿身閃亮的從水中躍出。</p>
<p>給苦痛壓住了的紅蘿蔔鬚不知道走了。</p>
<p>於是許多蝦把他包團着。</p>
<p>它們向他的喉頭湧上來。</p>
<p>它們發出一些細小的爆音。</p>
<p>它們已把鉗子張得大大的。</p>

<p>貧民窟生活專號（上）　　業餘漫談</p>
<h3 id="c260">「貧其不貧」與「平其不平」 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 樸</p>
<p>在讀者諸君未看本專號内容之前，我們應首先說明發刋貧民窟生活專號的動機與希望；</p>
<p>我們最近感覺我們過去所討論的政治社會等問題中似乎是忽略了今日中國當前一個最難解决而同時又是最主要的貧民生活問題，我們現在雖没有方法得到準確統計根據的數目字，但是所謂「貧民」，在上海以及推而至於全中國，我們至少限度僅憑我們所能耳聞目見的，也不能否認他的數目是已經超過全體中國人民的大半數以上。我們深感這種現象是中國目前「内在」的最大國難，這種國難在表面上是不若「外來」的那樣急迫，容易引起國人與國際間的注意，但其潛伏的危險性，則又適爲造成内亂外患，尤其是兩年來喪城失地一切國難的主因之一。而看到目前的趨勢，此種貧民數目的範圍更是將有增無减，同時政府及全國少數中大多數不貧的國人，除了依循習俗做一點慈善性質或近乎慈善性質的消职救濟外，對於從根本上面着手改進的工作幾乎無人注意。關於這一點我們理應特别注重於政府方面，因爲此種改進大多數民生疾苦的大政方針，不是少數私人所能爲力，必須運用政府的力量方能收效。但是考查政府過去的一切工作，向着此種目標去進行的實在太少了。對於外來的國難政府有種種不能不和的苦衷是或易於得人的諒解，但是對於這改進民生疾苦的政府的根本工作。亦可說是政府對國民所負的最重要的責任，也未見政储有什麽决心挽救的計劃與實行，這實爲我們所不可解的事，或有人說；「政府目前注重的是剿共，共剿平了之後，一切救濟問題方有辦法進行」，殊不知剿共固非我們所敢反對，但是我們却希望政府對於改進貧民生活的這個工作，至少限度要同「剿共」的問題同樣的注意，以同樣的决心去實行，如其不然，則恐怕等到共剿完了，國家也快要完了，豈不根本喪失政府今日剿共的初衷嗎？</p>
<p>中山先生曾說過一句最簡潔了當的話，他說，「我人所抱之唯一宗旨，不過平其不平，使不平者底於平而已矣」。我們看現在的政府究竟做了幾件「平其不平」的工作呢？雖政府中人，亦不能否認這種事實却是相反的演進着。若用最簡單的話來說明之，就是不是「平其不平」，乃是「貧其不貧，使不貧者底於貧而已矣」。我們發刋這貧民窟生活專號的最大的動機與希望就是深感貧民範圍的日趨擴大，實爲我們國家民族内在的根本危險，我們應大聲疾呼盡量宣露貧民的苦况，希望促起政府及一班不貧的國人們注意，使大家知道，貧民知活的慘象應如何急謀所以挽救之道。我們是深深的相信；無論在何種政治制度形式下的政府，倘若不注意「貧民」的問題，這個政府必將崩潰而不能久存！</p>

<p>— 挹靑</p>
<p>貧民窟在勞勃生路</p>
<p>走過小沙渡路的大鐘，一直拖西，馬路兩邊的房屋漸漸地漸漸地灰暗，傾斜，低矮而狹小起來。黑色的瓦，褐色的牆，陳腐了的設置，一切都呈現着疲乏和埀斃。没有整齊的街樹，没有美麗的裝飾，没有誘人的樂聲，没有發光的年紅燈，更没有活潑壯健的女郎，鑽石的光，脂粉的香。這裏，只有破舊的商店，貧弱的顏色，飢寒的呻吟，疾病的慘呌，窳敗的道路，瘦弱而灰黑色的人，汗液和血肉的穢氣。勞勃生路，就是這樣永永地永永地喘氣着，半醒不睡着。</p>
<p>著名的英華里就在離小沙渡路不遠的所在。牠那似蜂窩般的身子佔有了馬路的兩邊。數不淸的，一格一格的房屋裏，有許多苦命的人羣在蠕動。雖然他們的精神是那樣的疲憊，臉色是那樣的蒼白，但他們還是在不停地勞動，不停地掙扎，不停地流汗，不停地喘氣。形容不盡的破爛的敗物堆積滿地；人氣，烟氣和臭氣交流着，把整個的空間攪亂了，佔領了，窒息着每個人的呼吸，牠正像一大堆的爛瓜，上面有無數蒼蠅蚊蟲在嗡嗡的呌，又像一個滿貯污水的小池，池子裏有許多孑孑小虫在浮游。但是，牠是這裏大衆們的薈萃之區，牠是勞勃生路的精華！</p>
<p>跨過英華里，疎疎落落的房屋中間，不規則地隔列着高低起伏的荒塲。荒塲上，除了原有的墳墓和瓦礫衰草以外，有些人借了牠的一角，作爲棲身的根據，有些人更借了牠的一小塊，作那死而無歸的骸骨安息之地。所以這些無用的隙地，到是停留於斯的活人和死人藉以安身的天國。</p>
<p>用柏油澆成的平滑的路面上，不時有汽車，電車，塌車，獨輪小車在經過。塵灰和呌囂一陣又一陣地過去，始終喚不回一絲生動的熱氣。街燈伴着街道，冷淸淸地臥在銀灰色的光茫下，没有汽笛的鳴咽，便没有人羣的動盪。這裏</p>

<p>的生命完全操之於幾個在喉嚨大烟囱的掌握裏，每天每時都得不到解放。</p>
<p>曹家渡在勞勃生路的盡頭，那是一個貧乏的市塲，爲各種各式貧乏的東西所組成。小販的攤担陳列在路的兩旁，接二連三的，不論早晚，都有枯黃的靑菜，死了的鮮魚，發出惡臭的鹹鮝，血淋淋的猪頭牛身，以及許多可以放到垃圾堆去的東西在出賣。泥濘水潰舖了滿地，雖然在强烈的日光薰騰之下，也没有乾燥的時節。這裏是無所謂衛生的。　　誰曉得勞勃生路有這樣的風味丨又誰能深深地領悟到這裏的滋味丨她是都市繁榮的活力，她是天國脚下的地獄。然而太陽的光，到什麽時候才會照遍大地，光臨到這裏？</p>

<h3 id="c263">銅板跌價使貧民更難維持生活應如何救濟案 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— 提議者議員萬秋羣</p>
<p>（銅板與貧民窟）洋房和銅板當然不會發生怎樣重大的關係，原因是住在大洋房的人物，他們所需要的商品，不是卑賤的銅板所能完其使命。換句話說，就是他們所需要的東西，價格是貴的，要用銀子才能適合，所以，他們進進出出地都是銀子，和銅板絶少關係。反之，住在貧民窟的朋友，確各銅板休戚相關，他們進進出出地多是銅板，所以銅板的跌價，影響到他們的生活，使其更難維持。</p>
<p>貨幣本是一種商品，牠裏面也含有勞動量，牠的價格的低落，恒就是物價的上漲，牠的上漲，恒就是物價的低落。</p>
<p>在不多幾個月前，銅板的價格，是一元換二千五百文左右，最近呢，一元竟換到三千二百文左右，這就是說；現在的一個銅板，只等於貴時的一個銅板的百分之七十八，也就是；現在的一百文，僅等於貴時的八十文還差點，大槪是無形中打了一個八折。所以，有許多東西的價格，隨銅板計算起來是上漲了，於是在貧民窟裏用銅板的朋友，先得吃虧。</p>
<p>在貧民窟裏，最受銅板的苦惱的，莫過於一般的車夫小工和小販了。他們不能因銅板跌價而多加兩個銅板，一天的散工，依舊是三四毛小洋，火腿粽子依舊十二個銅板，油煎糕依舊是銅板三枚，於是，他們失勞力的代價，以及他們的取入，無形中又打了一個八折。</p>
<p>收入要打八折，付出要吃銅板八折的虧，在這雙　的八折之下下生活就愈加艱難了，這是洋房裏的公子小姐們所「意想不到」的了！</p>
<p>然則，如何救濟呢？那就有待於本刋讀者諸君的討論了！</p>
<h3 id="c264">這樣的一家！ <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 沉之</p>
<p>（草房）距一家工廠不遠，有一片低窪而潮濕的空地丨也可以說是一個露天的公坑吧。就在這骯髒的空地上，建造了一間矮小的草房。這草房眞小得可憐，長寛大約都不過六七尺呢。屋頂以及四面的謂墻，全是用破布，竹木，稻草和銹坯了的洋鐵皮補綴而成。大部的材料都來自「垃圾桶」。因爲材料的龐雜，這於技術上的困難，實在是可以想像得到的一事。尤其爲避免風雨的侵襲，所以不能不用粗大的草繩將整個房子錯綜地繞繫着。猶如附加的一種裝飾品。</p>
<p>這草房向馬路的一面，却開着一扇門，像一個竪立的鷄蛋形；眞太矮了。除了小孩外，非屈腰而入不可。所幸住在裏面的大人都已經成爲傴僂了呀！</p>
<p>雖然没有窗子，可是四百却有不少的罅隙，不特可以透進些微的陽光，就是雨小都有光顧的可能呢。</p>
<p>草房裏的人物，除了一對夫婦外，還有兩個小孩，大的八九歲，小的二三歲。老夫婦呢，總在四五十歲左右。</p>
<p>那家主人，他的左眼已經傷害了，給一條藥棉花緊裹着。他的背脊彎的很厲害，時時死命地咳嗽，甚至吐出一口濃綠的痰液。他不時又在那可憐的草窟之前踱着步子，好像滿懷着什麽心思。他的女人，一朿枯黃而篷鬆丨與摩登女郎的篷鬆絶無共同之點丨的頭髮，將她的前額和後頸罩着了。她的臉孔更是黃黑得可怕，這顯然是飽受生活熬煎與營養不良的標記。她没有什麽表情，憂愁與歡樂的餘痕都找不出了，這簡直是一幅死板的面孔丨那兩個小孩。只是兩隻瘦削的猴子，但絶對没有猴子那麽靈活。</p>
<p>他們的衣服，正是所謂「百家衣」，恰像他們所住的草房，純係形形色色的布料補綴而成的。尤其那一位主婦穿的邊緣不劃一的外衣。長僅及膝，正如前兩年上海所流行的短旗袍。她穿着一雙具有兩種式樣的鞋，在一家大小中，穿鞋算是她獨享的權利。</p>
<p>瞧瞧他們草房的内部吧。簡直是一個猪欄。向西一隅的地上，舖着像鹽包所結合的草蓆。在破絮堆中，有微弱的顫動，同時斷斷續續地發出悲鳴；原來是一個有生命的東西躺着在裏面呵！</p>
<p>窟的南面便當作廚房，有一個半月形破缸的竃，此外陳列着七零八落的碗筷等物，在北面呢，懸掛着一些謀生的工具，如泥水匠用的粉刷和拾垃圾的大糞箕之類。</p>
<p>天不下雨，還可在外面做飯。他們那裏有大米吃呢？一大鍋裏面燒的是攁心菜的大葉兒丨像這種大葉子原係餵猪的，在一般的菜田裏我們可以看見一堆堆如墳墓般的棄置着丨由渾濁的沸水的衝激，偶爾浮起幾條雪白的麵條，裏面僅僅放着一絲的鹽。油泥，據說不在議事日程之上。</p>
<p>他們的食物燒好了，都坐在地上吃。雖然只有四個人，却有各色各式的碗筷！有香烟筒，有半月形的碗。我乘着他們吃飯的機會，向那位主人攀談起來。</p>
<p>「你是那兒人？」我帶着同情而誠懇的態度問他。</p>
<p>「唉，先生！」他那和靄的面容中夾雜辛酸的氣分說，「我原是山東人，但爲着逃避苛捐雜稅的重負，不得已雜開老家已快八年了」</p>
<p>「你幹什麽事啦？」我恐怕他傷感，先是躊踷着，但終於鼓起勇氣說出來。　　「幹事嗎？」他急急呑下一口飯菜回答說；「唉，先生！現在說有事體，又没有事體；說没有事體也不能。我是幹的一種刷壁的小勾當。一個月難逢幾次運哩，我一家四口的生死，就完全倚靠我一身；我的一身却靠在運上呀！」</p>
<p>「你住在這兒多久了？」我接着問他。</p>
<p>「先生！我詳細的告訴你吧。」他已經忘記吃飯，一雙暗淡的眼睛，發出閃爍的柔光，老釘着我說；「前年秋天，我纔由浦東搬到閘北，借着一個比這寛大得多的草棚居住。那時的生意雖很壞，但我總還希望到了冬天或許可以好些，因爲到了冬天，許多人都要紛刷房屋準備度歲的。不料，後來東洋人的飛機把我們那一塊草棚炸成粉碎了。幸好總算救得我們四條狗命在這裏活受罪！」他說了這些話，飯也不吃了。一面提出一隻水桶，倒轉來，墊一件衣服忙請我坐下；一面仍和我深談。</p>
<p>「我從前在浦東做碼頭工人，每月也只能獲到一二十隻洋。我們幾年來都是這樣生活的。可是後來生活更加困難了，直到前年，碼頭工人一天多似一天，我又是個没有帮口的人；同時人也老了，碼頭上的工夫也吃不下呀！因此，就被排起走了！我現在什麽辦法也没有了，唯有等待着死亡呵！但是我還希望我的兩個兒子將來在了，或許可以替我們窮人出一口氣吧！」</p>
<p>他說完這一些話，精神更見萎頓。他的目光已轉向着那兩個一絲不持的小孩子身上。我看着他太傷心了，便藉着這機會走了。</p>

<p>— 諶麗生左匀合作</p>
<p>（艒艒船）上海人的生活眞是各種各樣的，富人有富人的生活，窮人有窮人的生活，無論如何是不能拉到一條生活線上去的。在窮人中有一種尤窮的生活，那就要說到這艒艒船裏的生活了。</p>
<p>艒艒船是一種無篷樓的船，在近代農村破產，都市經濟危機日益嚴重的局勢之下，艒艒船不景氣，是必有的遭遇。所以船裏一家人的生活，不能靠河浜裏的臭水來維持，而必須各尋出路，男人祇有拉車，女人就走進工廠，但拉車各做工的生活未必是圓滿的，上海的房子雖多，那是有錢人所享受，艒艒船雖然狹小，遮蔽風雨還是有用的。</p>
<p>所　在滬西的每條河浜裏，就有許多以艒艒船當做住所失人們，他們的房屋隨着河流的漲落而上下；如果船底經久了，抵不過流水潛入的時候，那也可以拖上岸旁，擱淺似的放置着，住還是不成問題，可是不能動蕩了。</p>
<p>這船裏的　，不用說，是　的可以。白天在船腰裏卸去一張破蘆蓆，使我們能作　　面的部視，貼眼望去，可以看到有一副兩眼　端正的擺着，還有缺了嘴的油　，破了　的醬油瓶，以及掉了手的鍋鏟；總之，對於炊事用具，倒也應有盡有，祇是破爛些吧了。船肚裹滿堆着泥污莩　和紅蘿蔔等。在船頭的這邊用篾片圈着二隻小猪，還有馬子，破布條，錫紙，香烟壳子，勒吐精的罐子，蹩了跟的高跟鞋以及尿布等等，胡亂的擱在一邊。</p>
<p>也有嫌船太狹仄了，將原有的蓆篷拆掉，拼些鉛皮木板，搭得像房子一樣，這是貴族化的艒艒船，也是他們肯勞動的結果；因爲荒貨攤上有的是舊貨，只要出一點代價，這代價的出處，就是要勞動；否則，肯多翻些垃圾桶，也是一樣可以得到的。</p>
<p>不過有一點要躭心的；在早潮來的時候，你不能貪睡，否則别的船户要喊醒你，責駡你，因爲你的船没有人照顧，離開了擋子，會軋壞人家的艙篷。如果一陣暴雨來了，要趕快佈置蓆篷，不然，雨水打進艙裏，夜裏就得睡在潮濕的板上。風起了，又是動蕩船的時候，一家人便不敢離開，恐怕纜子繫鬆了，船要飄流去的。所以住艒艒船絶不如住草篷子安靜，也是較草篷子窮的人才住艒艒船的。</p>

<p>（工房）平常，天一熱，在放工之後，工房中的，大多到弄堂裏來乘凉。年紀大一點的，跟着坐在旁邊的人講些現在世界上做人眞不容易過活一類的話。有時高興起來，也會談到中國的存亡，和過去參加五卅大罷工的歷史。年輕的男工，除了跟伙伴談談廠裏的飯桶怎樣的可惡，走狗怎樣的倚勢欺人等外，總是談到女人身上去。有的就走到年靑的姑娘旁邊，候着機會和她們搭訕。童工們，打紙牌，滾銅板是拿手好戲。四五歳的小孩們，儘管不知好夕的整天玩着；他們的母親，一天到晚，忙着縫衣服，燒飯，洗衣服，另外有幾個人，他們一放工就往各處亂跑，不到晚上，是不會回來的。</p>

<p>可是，今天在工房中似乎有些異乎尋常。没有像平時那樣的嘈雜，弄堂中的人，也没有往時的多；但是却從各個屋子裏透出很多的嘆氣聲。祗有小孩子們，仍是照舊玩着。幾個一放工就望四處亂跑的傢伙，今天也不亂跑了，大家都在根生丨他們中的一個丨家裏坐着。</p>
<p>「那件事是老孫對我講的，」老李，一個皮膚黝黑的大個兒，看了看圍着他的伙伴們說，「他說前三天，不是在我們吃飯的時候，從外面開進了三部裝滿棉紗的汽車嗎？汽車開到堆棧門口，就停住了，接着就有人把一包包的紗背進去。車旁站着廠裏的張ＸＸ。和一個像東洋人樣子的傢伙，鬼頭鬼腦的，不知在講些什麽。有人去問這是怎麽一會事，回說這是老廠裏運過來的。可是老孫有些不相信，他偷了個空，到外面去轉了一次，何來低聲告訴大家，到紗是從ＸＸ渡一個東洋紗廠裏運來的。當時大家聽了，都有些莫名其妙。今天資本家佈告說，棉紗生意不好，要减工；我才明白那是怎麽一回事了。」</p>
<p>大家聽了，都有點憤慨起來。</p>
<p>「剛才細紗間的小六子，在放工時對我講，　我們把這件事告訴車間的和住在這裏失人。要大家起來反對减工，」老李吃一口茶，又講着。</p>
<p>當天晚上，整個的工房，和今天放工回來時的沉默的空氣不同，也和平時的空氣不同，牠是處在一種異常緊張的空氣中了。</p>

<p>— 吕女士</p>
<p>（鴿籠式房子）一間鴿籠式房子，計前樓一爱是在烟草工廠做夜工的兩個小脚女人，前樓頂上是一個每晚咳得使人不能睡覺的小夥子，他年紀不過二十五六，但瘦得皮包骨了。房東住在客堂裏，客堂頂上是名呌擱樓的低籠子，鄙人就住在裏面了。亭子間住的是一對剛從鄉下來的夫婦，據說來找事做，但至今已有好幾個月了，還是住着。至於灶披間裏住着什麽人，我幾個月來還不曾見一面，也没有工夫去打聽。這籠裏的生活是這樣；</p>
<p>房東男的不知道幹什麽，不大看見他。女的成天在家裏打麻將，平常是閙到夜裏一點多鐘才收塲，特别對於我白天要上廠裏去的人，感到十分的苦惱。有時候，我非常氣憤，心想痛駡她一頓，但終於忍住了，比起來她究竟還趕不上咱們的那摩温那樣可惡，咱們的那麽温那才眞是凶神呢！遲一點要打，要駡，要罰，慢一點也要打，要駡，要罰。有時候我心裏閃過這樣的念頭；「帶一把刀，從那麽温的頭頂上劈下去」，好像要這樣才可以消我的氣似的。可是，我知道就是我一個人把她殺掉也没有用，因爲還有更多的那麽温在壓迫我們，死掉一個還有第二個來的。所以除了咱們被壓迫的人們團結起來反抗他們以外，個人的反抗是没有結果的。</p>
<p>亭子間的一對夫婦，那眞是莫名其妙了，一會兒聽見他們嘻哈大笑，一會兒聽見那男的在吵駡，一會兒又聽見女的在喊死呌活，杯碗有時會飛出窗外，玻璃有時會打成碎片。房東太太哇哇啦啦的駡了，却立刻就銷聲匿跡，吵的不吵了，哭的不哭了。眞奇怪，爲什麽兩性間的生活會是這樣的不融洽啊！</p>
<p>說到我自己，早上上廠去，天還不曾亮就要起來，急急忙忙地燒一點飯，菜是昨天晚上就買好的，或許是蘿蔔乾，或許是醬菜，提着飯籃就跑，不要等廠裏拉回聲就要趕到。一進去就是十二個鐘頭才放出來。回到家裏簡直就和半死的人差不多，胡亂喫一點東西就倒在床上睡了。丨丨這樣的做着機器的奴隷，不知道要什麽時候方可以得到休息！　　前樓的兩個小脚女人，一月裏難得見面兩三次，她們回來我出去了，我回來她們又出去了，只有在路上還偶然可以碰到。一個據說是嫂嫂，哥哥在發大水的時候被冲支了；一個是妹妹，大約十七八歲光景，但是又黑又瘦。她們兩人得來的工錢，除了寄一些給家裏的婆婆以外，還得按月送三塊錢給介紹介丨介紹她們進工廠的人丨，她們自己却也没有什麽可以剩下了。</p>
<p>頂上擱樓的那小夥子，最近失了業，他本來是在ＸＸ鐵廠裏做生活的。别的不大淸楚，偶然在半夜睡醒，聽得房東太太在「碰，東風」牌聲中夾着談到他，大約他已經欠了兩個月的房錢了。</p>

<p>— 宜珊女士</p>
<p>（屋簷下街樓底）我住在一個碼頭區域裏，這個區域因爲旣近碼頭，又有許多　堂，大餅店，和一個小菜塲的緣故，便成爲碼頭勞働者的集合地方了。假如你經過這地方，你就會瞧見各處都是爛眼，歪鼻，臉兒紅腫的奇形怪狀的工人。在早晨，晚上和假日，滿街滿巷都塞滿了他們，不要說是汽車，人力車，就是人們走過，也要左推右避，紆　多次，才得通過。</p>
<p>這班勞動者，全是没有家的。他們白天在碼頭出賣了所有的勞力，晚上回來，胡亂的塞飽了肚皮後，就躺在馬路兩旁的屋簷下，和衖堂裏的街樓底下睡覺了。遇了雨天，小雨就硬着讓雨淋，大雨就到擁擠不堪的衖堂街樓底，或别處可以稍遮蔽的地方坐着而睡了。他們整天勞苦的代價不能供他們住小客棧，其實，他們若能夠不挨餓就算是幸運了。整年由人春至夏，由秋至冬，在四季的循環裏，他們呆板地拖着卑微的生命。至多花三四個銅板買一碗酒精攙水的酒喝，來剌激剌激他們的麻木了的神經。有的抽不起大烟的，却花十個銅板到隣雅片水是用煎成了烟膏的烟土渣重新放水下去煑的。牠比雅片還要能吸血敲骨。那些喫大餅饅頭，肚裏没有脂膏的勞動者喝不上四五天使成癮君子了，不久就簡直成爲活動的木乃伊了。</p>
<p>他們雖終年勞苦的工作着，但喫的是大餅，饅頭，或腐壞了的魚肉，睡的是街頭巷尾，無論是怎樣强壯的身體，生命也不能捱得許久的，更何况他們還被酒精，烟水消磨去生命力呢？所以我常常在齷齪小路旁或潮灦而惡臭的衖堂裏，看見躺着的，痛苦地呻吟着的勞　者，於是在第二天或隔四五天，他就直躺着不會動了，直至給巡捕房發覺，派人來把他抬到不知什麽地方去。而那些還活着的同類的動物呢。他們仍舊是在做工，喝酒，喝烟水，麻木地，絶望地生活着，待到他們也有一天躺着不會醒來。</p>

<p>— 笑塘</p>
<p>（？？？）那正是春將去時的一個昨期日的深晚，時間已經是一點鐘，冷爽的凄絶的風在死去了的繁華大道中獨自遊蕩，我便跟隨着這遊蕩的風走上了北四川路橋堍，橋的南堍下顯露出蠕動着的黑影，在淸絶的電燈光下抖動，我一眼看去便知道是三個所謂小　三的人物，正在趁着他們「拉黃牛」的夜生意經。一種好奇心丨實在是無聊心丨使我漸漸的走近了他們。我很勇敢的向他們開始了「接談」的第一聲，我說話的聲　幕仿着「大亨」的口吻。</p>
<p>「你們每天這樣的拉黃包車，有多省銅板可以進賬？」</p>
<p>「也說不定，最好的時候一二千文也有，最倒霉的時候，勉强有一二百文。」他們中間一個十五六歲的，遲疑的望了我幾眼，才慢呑呑的這樣回管着。　　「哪丨我們每天交賬，要交五百細呢！」一個十歲左右，臉上没有一絲血色的孩子，天眞的，坦白的，搶着喊了出來</p>
<p>「什麽，你們也要交賬，交給那一個呢？」我眞出乎意外的驚奇聞着。</p>
<p>「哼！怎麽不要交賬，交給「爺叔」啊！每天一定要交五百細呢！」又是那孩子回答着。</p>
<p>我才很悲哀的確信他們的交賬并不是一件虚說的事，因爲我至少也知道一些上海經騐，曉得「爺叔」是上海的名人之一。</p>
<p>「那麽交了五百細的賬以外，你們還有錢可以剩嗎？如是果在你們最倒霉的時候，又怎麽辦呢？」</p>
<p>「我們倒霉不倒霉，「爺叔」是不管的。「爺叔」所管的是我們每天一定要交賬的五百細。我們每一個人都有「爺叔」，我也拜過「爺叔」的，他們兩人也都有「爺叔」的，不拜爺叔能讓你「趕生意」？非「爺叔」答應你到這裏來，你有這膽兒來嗎？」那孩子一連串的說着，又很興奮的接下去說；「我們每天是非交五百細不可的。若是你今天交不出五百細，爺叔非打得你臭要死不可，啊唷！哪娘呵！爺叔打起來眞是要命！」說着，孩子一手拉起了他的右褲脚管，又接下去說；「哪！哪！娘格Ｘ。我身上打得一條條的痛得喊救命，現在仍然是麻辣得可以。唉，唉，爺叔打起來眞是要命，他一個人把你關了起來，甚麽東西拿着便亂抽，那裏有人來勸一勸呢？」那孩子只想把褲脚往上拉，可是又小又緊又恐拉破似的，只捺着在膝灣上。他一隻手不由得在屁股與大脚後面連連的輕摩。</p>
<p>那大一些的一個也挿嘴着說；「我們有了錢也完全要交給「爺叔」。給他搜到了私藏的錢，又是一塲大禍。爺波偶然所給我們的一身衣服，哪，便像我們身上污舊的衣服。」他可憐的目光望着我，那最大的一個始終没有回答過我一句話，只用着三角式的眼睛不住的打量我。</p>
<p>「那麽，你們怎麽會弄得如此流落的地步呢？你們每夜在橋上這樣的拉嗎？你們睡覺起來也在「爺叔」的家裏嗎？」</p>
<p>孩子永遠是天眞的，爽直的，又接口來回答道；「我們都是逃出來的。不是爺娘窮得没飯吃，便是給學生意的先生打得凶，逃到這裏來，眞是苦得要死。每夜要拉到天亮，睡覺時甚麽污穢冷僻的角隅，便是我們的床舖，今天睡在那裏我們是從没有預先想到的。「爺叔」的家是「爺叔」們的地方，我們從來没有家，也不知有家。在從前，我們還好一些，現在，白天已不能「趕生意」，因爲給巡捕看見了便要抓，抓到捕房裏至少要關十二個鐘點，又冷又餓的眞要我們半條性命，所以只好趁着深晚躱閃着做些生意。」</p>
<p>橋頂上傳來了笑語聲，有五輛人力車接連着上來，三個孩子便跳奔上去。人力車中坐的是三個舞女，和兩個靑年。靑年們的頭上却戴着紅綠的紙帽，口中唱着「璇宮艷史」曲。舞女的笑聲如鬼呌一般尖顫。一羣奔馳的黑影往橋堍下瀉去，從人力車中抛出了兩侗銅板，因爲我聽見兩聲淸脆落地的叮叮。孩子們喧喧嚷嚷的追駡着，靑年一舉手，似乎有東西抛打着他們。一個高大的巡補身影如鬼一般的出現，孩子們便驚惶的消逝在黑弄堂裏。</p>

<p>— 文瑛</p>
<p>慘劇趣劇形形色色</p>
<p>美容院裏牛鬼蛇神</p>
<p>本年三月十日下午五時五十五分，美國好萊塢發生了强烈的地震。撼搖的前後雖不過一分鐘，但其間各影界人物，驟不及防地受了突然的驚嚇，不知不覺地演出了種種怪劇，其中還有許多慘劇許多笑話，形形色色，不及備述。現在僅就要要緊些的事件，略爲陳述一下。</p>
<p>我們現在先講些爲地震而受傷的事。以多婚浪漫著稱的潘琪霍金斯喬易絲（ＰｅｇｇｙＨｏｐｋｉｎｓＪｏｙｃｅ）的粉臉上燙傷了一大塊。那時她正在用火鉗燙頭髮地震冷不及防地一來，她一失手將煊紅的火鉗往臉上一送，結果是臉皮燙破了。喬斯琳李（ＪｏｃｅｌｙｎＬｅｅ）在五點五十五分的時候，正在淴噴水浴。不意脚下一滑。身體往後一仰，如同鷂子翻身，背脊着地。結果兩節背脊骨跌出了骱，在醫院中養了好幾天。還有一位頂危險的安妮達潘琪（Ａｎｉｔａｐｓｇｅ）。她正在樓上修飾，頂備出去吃晚飯。她修飾好了，站在扶梯口和在樓下的人講話。地震突然而來，安妮達翻身跌了下去。從扶梯最上級一直滾到扶梯最下級。跌得她渾身靑腫，足脛亦腫了一大塊。</p>
<p>還有伊麗莎蘭第（ＥｌｉｓｓａＬｏｉｎｄｉ），她已臥病好久了。那天將近六點鐘的時候，她還躺在床上，忽然牆上的鏡子，打了下來，室中器地，互相搖動着。伊麗莎和她的母親一齊奔到室外。她因爲久病之軀，突然受了這次驚嚇，病勢又加重了好些。以上都是些慘劇還有喜劇呢？</p>
<p>麗琳塔許門（ＬｉｌｙａｎＬａｓｈｒｎａｎ）說，要在地震時看喜劇，最好的地方是美容院。那天她在美容院修飾好了，正要開門出去的當兒，地震突然地來了。一般女人，面上塗滿了白的粉，藍的泥，有的是披頭散髮，有的頭髮燙了一半。有的正在用電燙髮，他們手忙脚亂地將頭髮拚命的從捲髮機上拉了下來。大家一起向着大門奔出去，麗琳塔許門看了非但忘了驚恐，反而大笑起來。</p>
<p>有一位亞特靈愛姆斯（ＡｄｒｉｅｎｎｅＡｍｅｓ）正在畫嘴唇，預備出去吃晚飯。她手中拿了胭脂筆，細細地在櫻唇上描畫着，忽然地一震一枝筆從嘴一直畫到耳朶邊。她還不知道，連忙奔下樓梯準備往外逃生。一個侍女看見她口唇裂了一條大口子，一直通到耳朶邊，嚇得哭喊起來。</p>
<p>此外還有許許多多的趣事，可惜不能統通寫牠出來。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c274">評「虎嘯獅吼」 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＴｈｅＢｉｇＣａｇｅ</p>
<p>又是一張獸片。</p>
<p>假如有誰問；「爲什麽歐美影業家總是愛拍獸片的呢？是否這便是敎育影片呢？」那末我們可以這樣的回答他說；「這是逃避現實。同時企業家也深知怯懦的觀衆們對於逃避現實的需要，於是大家都對現實不敢正視，而委滿意的看着野獸搏鬥了。」</p>
<p>當然，假使電影藝術家能夠誠意的本着敎育的意義，將各種獸辟，很科學的加以詳明的解釋，那末我們看電影的時候便是上課了。但是歐美的同業家不會這樣幹，在他們的生產過程中，這種獸片必定要「恐怖」，「緊張」，獸與獸鬥，人與獸揮，而且還要加上美人的大腿，肉感的擁抱，熱情的Ｋｉｓｓ於是乎小孩兒們因之大聲歡笑，靑年男女因之更加恩愛，而老年人也因之又長了見識了。這樣才可以賣座，這樣才可以賺錢。然而多看了這種片子，究竟不免頭暈。</p>
<p>如上所述，已經成了一種公式，在「人猿泰山」中，可以適用，在「奈格那」中可以適用，而這一部「虎嘯獅吼」自然不會例外，當然也很適用。照着公式演下去，換過一個片名，又是一套。</p>
<p>關於本片，據廣告上說確是獅子和老虎各有十六，但是在畫面上却没有方法數淸，然而這些獅虎便是本片的精靈。的確，假如我們將本片當做馬戲看，那末多少是很有興趣的。獅子咬老虎，老虎咬人，人打獅子和老虎煞是好看。此外還有手槍的轟擊，自來水的澆射，閃電，打雷，暴風雨，人辟的奔逃，拚命的呌喊。眞是「緊張」「恐怖」兼而有之當然，這是導演懂得這一公式的原故。</p>
<p>但是導演除了有上述的各點之外其他對於劇情的進展，簡直没有運用Ｍｃｎｔａｇｅ的方法，前後人物的聯繫，使人不易明顯。事實上雖然有一個故事，但是這故事却全無系統。</p>
<p>至於表演及其他方面，除了那主角的馴野獸的技藝驚人以外，均無可取之處。</p>
<p>總之，如將本片當作馬戲看，到是可以快樂的了。</p>

<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c276">寫給春水情波的編劇者 <a href="#c276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— 伍成</p>
<p>本年度明星公司的幾張新片，如自由之花，狂流，女性的呐喊，道德寳鑑，前程等，都已使我們感覺到明星公司是在轉變他的風格了。觀衆都很快慰的希望明星公司能不斷的努力。</p>
<p>春水情波據說是鄭正秋繼自由之花的得意作，但事實上却使我們整個的失望。雖然在導演上，剪裁上，攝影上，佈景上都是很可取的。演員們又都是很賣力的，但在這樣一個劇情的支配下，實難有充分的收穫的。因爲這義意實在太不健全了。這樣多角戀愛的事蹟怎演得出好戲呢？</p>
<p>照例這裏應描寫些舊社會道德制度下女性所受的隱痛，並指示新女性應走的途徑。但事實上轉移了重心，編劇皆不在應做的地方着力，反在有閒階級玩弄女性的行爲上用功夫。而且狹義的人道主義，報復主義，因果律，更是錯誤</p>

<p>— 嘉南</p>
<p>電影的使命，决不僅是供給一部份有閒階級的消遣的。它應該供給一般的需要，和代表大衆的伸訴。中國電影界，似乎已有了這種「覺悟」了。除掉已有「人道」「爭扎」「奮鬭」「女性的呐喊」等先後問世外，這裏明星公司又快有同樣意義的新片「鐵板紅淚錄」出來，描述屈服在橫徵暴歛的軍閥鐵蹄下的四川民衆的慘象，和代表當地阿斗一些微弱的呻吟這片由洪深導演，而女生主角王瑩女士在話劇裏早有優美的成績，在電影上亦有很好的收穫。男主角是蜚聲話劇界的陳凝秋。其餘的演員是二十多位久在洪深指導下的復旦學生。無疑的，這片會給我們有較大的認識，現在他們明天要到外埠去攝取外影去了。不久的將來，這張片子，就會顯現在我們面前了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Sino-Japanese Representatives' Negotiations Ready <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Ding Qiang Pseudo-Army to be Conveniently Handled by the Chinese Side</p>
<p>The Reopening of the Beining Railway to be Expedited by Both Sides' Cooperation</p>
<p>The Security of the Buffer Zone to be the Responsibility of the Hebei Provincial Government</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Xiong Bin visited Okamura and Nakamura at 10 a.m. on the 3rd, to discuss how to handle the pseudo-army. The meeting lasted for two hours, but no concrete solution was reached. Mr. Xiong returned to Ping by the evening train to report to He and Huang and study countermeasures. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 7 p.m. on the 2nd, Chinese representatives Xiong Bin, Li Zeyi, Zeng Shourong, Xu Zuyi, and others, six in total, visited the Japanese delegation to discuss the procedures and steps for implementing the truce agreement. The following was generally agreed upon:</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese side will take appropriate measures to handle Li Jichun's army, such as reorganizing or disbanding it, without Japanese intervention. (2) The maintenance of security in the buffer zone will be the responsibility of the Hebei Provincial Government. For now, a certain number of armed police will be temporarily designated. If necessary, a temporary conference may be convened by both parties to decide on increasing the number of personnel. Regarding the weapons carried by the police, the Chinese side requested to use rifles and machine guns.</p>
<p>(3) Both parties will expedite consultations to restore traffic on the Beining Railway from Yuguan to Lutai.</p>
<p>(4) When the Chinese army has completely withdrawn, the Japanese army will withdraw to the Great Wall line.</p>
<p>The meeting between the two parties ended at 10:30 p.m. The Chinese representatives also had dinner at the Japanese representative's office. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Sino-Japanese truce agreement in Tianjin, the more difficult practical problems to solve are (1) the disposition of Ding Qiang's army, (2) the restoration of traffic on the Beining Railway, and (3) the method of maintaining security in the buffer zone. Yesterday afternoon, Xiong Bin, Xu Yanmou, Lei Shourong, Li Zeyi, and others arrived in Tianjin and, together with Qian Zongze, who arrived in Tianjin the day before, discussed the details with Yu Xuezhong. They then met with Japanese Secretary Nakayama, and Majors Nagatsu and Fujiwara, to discuss until late at night. It is reported that the following was generally decided:</p>
<p>(1) Ding Qiang's army is not an army of Manchukuo but an independent force that arose during the chaotic situation. It can be resolved by the Chinese side.</p>
<p>(1) Both sides will cooperate to ensure the Beining Railway line is opened to traffic quickly.</p>
<p>(1) The entire buffer zone is within Hebei Province and can be the sole responsibility of Yu Xuezhong for maintaining security. If the police force is insufficient to maintain security in the area in the future, representatives from China and Japan can convene a meeting at any time to discuss security measures. After the negotiations were completed, Secretary Nakayama and military officers Nagatsu and Fujiwara returned to Beiping at 9 a.m. this morning. (3rd Domei News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong said that the issue of receiving various counties is complicated. Because this agreement is a direct relationship between China and Japan, without a third party participating, it is different from the Shanghai Incident. There is no need to organize a reception committee. The counties will still be received by the county magistrates and chiefs of the public security bureaus. Each county will be assigned a security team or special police, the name of which has not yet been determined. Xiong Bin in Tianjin is in contact with the Japanese side to discuss specific measures, which may be decided within the next few days. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e8">To Discuss Outstanding Issues with Huang Fu <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, observing the situation after the establishment of the truce agreement, sees that the Chinese side has sincerity. It is preparing to resolve various outstanding issues through negotiation once the political situation stabilizes. As a first step, it recognizes that it is necessary for Minister Arita and Huang Fu to hold talks regarding general North China affairs. It is reported that Minister Arita has been instructed to go north. Minister Arita's opinion is that now is not the time to start negotiations and intends to continue to adopt a wait-and-see attitude, but since Tokyo's intention is such, Minister Arita will probably be ordered to go north in mid-month. Furthermore, with regard to urgent negotiations on the connection problem of the Fengshan and Beining Railways, Secretary Nakayama of the Beiping Embassy will be responsible for the negotiations.

<h3 id="e25">Global Military Reduction and Japan's Apparent Military Expansion <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>The US President has advocated using the UK Prime Minister's military reduction plan as a foundation. After the reduction of world military strength, a ray of hope has appeared for world peace. The seemingly intractable state of disputes may have a turning point. The proposal of peaceful concessions may be realized. Therefore, various countries are celebrating with each other, most of them having some sincerity to assist peace and reduce political crises, in order to help the transition from global economic panic. Even Germany's Hitler, who is moving backward in time, also knows that the public will is difficult to defy, and considers its national strength, and agrees to the military reduction proposal. Only the Japanese militarists in the East are obsessed with the illusions of dominance over the Pacific and exclusive control of the North China market. They support their so-called continental policy with an absolutely superior army. Now that they have captured "Manchuria" and are looking down on North China, they can claim hegemony in the West Pacific. But they still think it is not enough, believing that they must overwhelm the United Kingdom and the United States in the East and subdue the Soviet Union in order to satisfy their desires and resolve their political and economic crises.</p>
<p>Since the Washington Conference, the naval agreement between the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan means that Japan's naval strength is second to only the United Kingdom and the United States. It can be called the sole leader in the world. Moreover, the United Kingdom's colonies are spread all over the world. It is extremely difficult to concentrate its naval forces. Even if the Singapore naval base is built, it can only serve as the vanguard of India. Hong Kong is also just a corner of Australia. It is not as concentrated and geographically united as Japan's naval power. As for the United States, its powerful support point in the Pacific is Pearl Harbor in Hawaii. Manila is the closest port, but it is 4,840 nautical miles away. Although Guam is nominally a bomb in front of Japan's door, it has no solid fortress equipment due to the restrictions of the Washington Treaty. In the event of an incident, it is merely an unfulfilled explosive shell. It has absolutely no ability to explode. It is not like Japan, which has the interconnected Yokosuka, Kure, and Sasebo naval ports, which respond flexibly to each other. Moreover, the United States must defend the Atlantic and maintain maritime transport through Panama. Its military power is divided and its strength is dispersed. Although Japan's naval ratio to the United Kingdom and the United States is 10:10:6 on the surface, it is still in an advantageous position. Moreover, since the establishment of the London Naval Treaty, the ratio of the Japanese navy to the United Kingdom and the United States has increased. In particular, Japan's auxiliary vessels have not reached the numbers stipulated by the London Treaty. The deepening of the economic panic in the United States means it is unwilling to engage in unproductive military expansion, eating away at its national strength. Japan is the opposite. Cruisers, both heavy and light, are on par with the United States. Its submarine fleet even surpasses the United Kingdom and the United States. Its ship types are new, its speed is fast, its artillery has a long range, and its cruising range is also longer. However, Japan still believes that it cannot control the overall situation in East Asia and cannot subdue the United States' air strikes. It cannot help but harbor great fears. Therefore, in addition to the general agreement, it proposed a so-called special agreement, dividing the world into the Atlantic Group, the Pacific Group, the European Group, and the South American Group, in order to disperse the strength of the United Kingdom and the United States, divert the attention of the great powers, and concentrate Japan's naval power.</p>
<p>On the surface, Japan seems to have agreed to the US President's peace proposal. In fact, it has invaded Jin-Dong with the guise of "military activity as police activity" and seized the Northeast by invoking "the exercise of the right to self-defense." It has already occupied an absolutely dominant position on the Asian continent. Its strong military strength is unmatched by other countries. Moreover, it also possesses the rich natural resources of the four northeastern provinces. If the "Japan-Manchuria Economic Alliance" is fully formed, it will have a solid foundation to resist the Soviet Union in the north and repel the United States in the east. It does not fear the lack of sufficient raw materials in peacetime, so why fear the risk of scarcity in wartime?</p>
<p>What it is most worried about and planning for day and night is, first, the big ship and big gun doctrine of the United States of North America. In peacetime, Japan's financial resources are insufficient. If the competition is too fierce, it will inevitably be at a disadvantage. Moreover, giant ships carry heavy burdens and travel long distances, which is indeed convenient for long-distance navigation. Japan taking a defensive posture would be very disadvantageous. Second, American aircraft are particularly developed. Soviet aviation is even more dominant. Aircraft carriers are sea monsters. If they carry aircraft and cross the Pacific to attack its important</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>cities, then Tokyo and Osaka will inevitably feel enormous threat. Therefore, it issued a concrete proposal for military reduction. The first is to reduce battleships to 25,000 tons, heavy cruisers to 8,000 tons, and light cruisers to 6,000 tons to reduce the attack power of the United States. The second is to propose the complete abolition of aircraft carriers and advocate prohibiting all ships from having aircraft-carrying equipment. If so, Japan can eliminate the threat of being bombed by aircraft and prepare slowly, using its terrain to control the Far East, so that the United States' maritime traffic to the East will be dependent on Japan. The reality of market development is controlled by the Japanese. In this way, Japan can enjoy the name of military reduction and have the reality of military expansion. This is why the United States firmly insists on maintaining the Washington Treaty and opposes Japan's new proposal.</p>
<p>Sharp Intensification of Trade Conflict between Britain and Japan</p>
<h3 id="e26">Will Britain Resist Japanese Goods? <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>British Parliament Discusses Japan's Economic Invasion</p>
<p>Calls for Cooperation with the United States and Cancellation of the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>Anglo-Japanese Negotiations to Divide the Market</p>
<p>(London) This afternoon, the House of Commons debated the rocket-like external trade activities of Japan. The members stated that Japan's extremely cheap goods were seizing British markets. Conservative MP Levan declared that Japan occupied a very advantageous position in the trade of the thirteen districts of the empire, and was increasing step by step. If an Anglo-Japanese agreement cannot be negotiated immediately, it will be necessary to limit the number of Japanese goods entering the UK. Conservative MP Holmesley said that this is not a commercial competition issue, but a national belief of economic aggression, using various tools such as currency inflation and trademark theft to seek to dominate the world market and take steps towards dominating the East. Britain and its self-governing territories and India should cooperate more closely, and then enter into agreements with countries such as France, Belgium, and Italy to share the markets of the colonies, and should have closer contact with the United States. Colville, Under-Secretary for Overseas Trade, replied on behalf of the government that Japan's low labor costs greatly increase its competitiveness, but Japan's organization and its efficient production still need subsidies, and the recent sharp fall in gold exchange rates also give Japanese merchants a great advantage. At present, there is no evidence to know whether the amount of subsidies is equal to the difference between the sales price of Japanese goods and the sales price of British goods. Japanese goods are increasing day by day in places where British goods sell well, which has triggered the need to implement a boycott plan. This plan may be to impose high taxes or to limit the quantity of imports, especially discriminatory actions, such as canceling the Anglo-Japanese Commercial Treaty.</p>
<p>Now the Indian government has notified Japan to cancel the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty. This move allows the Indian government to implement a special plan for imported Japanese goods after the expiration of the treaty. Ke later stated that with regard to the domestic market, the import tax law stipulates an opportunity for British industries to obtain tax protection. As for foreign markets, the government cannot take direct action. Any action must be based on treaties. As a result of the Ottawa Conference, the self-governing territories have given Britain certain preferential treatment. Most colonies have recently revised their tax rules to benefit British exports, mainly cotton goods. West Africa cannot implement imperial preferential treatment due to international obligations, but so far the valuable Lancashire market has not been seriously affected by Japanese goods competition. Ke also said that the competition is now becoming more intense. The serious nature of the problem has caused the domestic government to carefully handle the matter. This is a very complex problem that should be resolved as a whole, not piecemeal. Minister of Commerce Rensiman recently spoke with the Japanese Ambassador, stating that the British government sees the issue as one of the great difficulties for British industry, and suggested to the Japanese Ambassador that the first step should be for representatives of British and Japanese industrialists to meet in order to divide the market among themselves. The reply is now under consideration, and details cannot be disclosed. When Rensiman met with the Japanese Ambassador, he also said that the ordinary agencies would notify the Japanese authorities that the British government was willing to give prior notice that the West African Treaty, which had given Japan most-favored-nation treatment, was about to be cancelled, but this was not just a matter of one market. The British government felt that the best way to deal with this matter was for the two governments to strive for a general understanding on all markets. Ke concluded that the government will facilitate negotiations in various ways. (2nd Reuters Electric)</p>
<p>Since two years ago, Osaka's textile operators have had considerable income growth due to the drop in raw cotton and the foreign exchange market, and the increase in exports. However, after the abolition of the Japan-India treaty, the future of overseas markets must be watched. The current settlement of Toyo Spinning is still 18%, Kanebo, Dai Nippon Spinning, Nisshin Spinning, Kishiwada Spinning, and Jinhua Yarn all increased their dividends by one cent, but Tenma Spinning reduced them to be vigilant about the uncertain future.

<p>(New York) Japanese representative Ishii departed for London today aboard the Olympic liner. He made no comment on the proposals Japan will present at the economic conference. He only stated to visitors that his attitude on many issues would shift according to the trend of events. Regarding economic issues related to "Manchukuo," he would especially act as the situation dictates and make temporary decisions. It is rumored that Ishii discussed the economy and finance of "Manchukuo" with the American President. However, neither the White House nor Ishii revealed any details of the conversation. Before his departure today, Ishii stated that we would cooperate to restore international trade and confidence. However, the method of cooperation will be decided at the beginning of the conference. He believes the conference will be successful. It is reported that since Ishii left America, all discussions in Washington concerning the conference agenda have concluded. Besides Hull and others who have already departed, the remaining members of the American delegation will also set sail early next week. (2nd National Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e28">Policy of Economic Aggression <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>What do Our People Think?</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to focus on economic diplomacy after withdrawing from the League of Nations. The conclusion of the Japan-Netherlands Arbitration Treaty, the Japan-Uruguay Trade Treaty, and others are the first steps in concretizing this policy. When compiling the next year's budget, they have decided to expand the expenses for establishing new embassies and consulates and for commercial officials. The respective bureaus of trade for Europe, America, and Asia are drafting plans. It is rumored that the following has already been internally decided and will be included in the next year's budget after being discussed and decided by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs: 1. New embassy locations: Cairo in Egypt, Addis Ababa in Abyssinia, Kabul in Afghanistan, and Bogota in Colombia. 2. New or upgraded consulate locations: Yilan, Hailun, and Chengde in "Manchukuo," Karachi and Madras in India, and Wellington in New Zealand. The number of commercial secretaries will be increased in two locations in the Near East and Africa and placed in major embassies and consulates general. (3rd Denttsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>British Newspaper Comments on Our Tariffs</p>

<p>(London) Today's editorial in The Times stated that while the outcome of China's new tariffs is uncertain, it will be unfavorable to British trade. This move is for fiscal purposes, but it also has political implications. It is clear that the Nanjing government wants Japanese producers to suffer the consequences of their country's policy in Manchuria. According to reports in Chinese newspapers, the government was instructed to reorganize finances to compensate for the loss of revenue from the three northeastern provinces. If there is any inconvenience, Japan should be held responsible. Other countries cannot avoid being collaterally burdened. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>The Four-Power Pact is Shelved</p>
<h3 id="e30">The Problem Remains with France and Germany <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) It is reported that Premier Daladier and Foreign Minister Poncet discussed the Four-Power Pact with the British Ambassador for two and a half hours, but no agreement was reached. The revisions proposed by France have prevented the immediate signing of the pact. Daladier claimed that the draft had been reviewed and there was still room for improvement. Poncet also stated that new instructions have been telegraphed to the French Ambassadors in Rome and London. It is generally believed that these negotiations will continue for several days. (3rd National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The signing of the Four-Power Pact was suddenly delayed in the final five minutes due to the demands of France and Italy to change the contents of the draft. The German diplomatic community was extremely disappointed by this news. Although the French side made many allusions in its semi-official declarations, this recent delay has nothing to do with Germany. Therefore, the German semi-official Foreign Communications Report stated that France's difficulties are due to its concessions to the demands of the Little Entente countries, which require the pact to explicitly recognize that no future treaty revisions are possible, even within the scope of the League of Nations charter. This would permanently maintain the existing situation in Europe, which is contrary to Mussolini's original intention of advocating for the pact. The Foreign Communications Report further stated that France has reached a crossroads today and must choose one of two paths: either comply with the selfish demands of the Little Entente countries or consider the peaceful cooperation of the entire Europe. It is difficult to continue to waver between the two. (3rd National Dispatch)</p>
<p>The negotiations on the Rome Four-Power Pact have now reached a critical stage. Although it is currently impossible to find official news to confirm this, it is widely believed that Mussolini has informed France that he cannot accept France's demand for strict control over Germany's future arms manufacturing. It is rumored that Mussolini originally intended to deliver an important speech on the Four-Power Pact in the Senate tomorrow, but the Senate will not convene tomorrow. Therefore, Mussolini will not be able to make any statement before Monday. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>A Rome-based correspondent for the Qing Yi Bao of Rome and Paris wrote an article on the Four-Power Treaty, stating that the reason why the draft has not been provisionally signed is not due to purely formal issues. The main point is that there are various different proposals for Article 3. The first draft proposes that the four powers mutually implement disarmament in stages. The second draft stipulates that Germany should not only implement its own disarmament in stages, but also agree with other countries to take beneficial measures for each signatory country. The second proposal is the one sent by Paris to the Little Entente countries. However, this clause would prevent Germany from signing with other countries on an equal footing, and would give other countries the right to supervise Germany's disarmament process and actual situation. It is feared that Germany will use this as a reason to refuse recognition. (2nd Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Foreign Office confirms that the reason for the delay in signing the Rome Four-Power Pact is that France has requested some points to be further refined. It is now hoped that after French Premier Daladier and British representatives Londonderry and Eden negotiate in London next week, the drafting of the pact can be finalized. (3rd Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Anti-Smoking Commission held a June 3rd Anti-Smoking Commemoration today, attended by over 300 representatives from various central government agencies, including Chu Minyi. Liu Ruiheng, Chairman of the Anti-Smoking Commission, presided over the meeting and delivered a speech, briefly stating that although China has been banning smoking for a long time, it has not been completely eradicated. In the future, attention should be paid to education to make people avoid it like a scorpion. On today's memorial day, a major resolution should be made to achieve the goal of eradication. Chu Minyi and Liu Mianzhi then gave speeches, briefly stating that the memorial's significance is twofold: one is to commemorate Lin Zexu's spirit of rejecting drugs, and the other is to continue efforts to ban smoking. The public sale of opium, in particular, is like drinking poison to quench thirst. They hope that all the people of the country can awaken. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>A Mechanical Pilot Creates</p>
<h3 id="e32">A New Record for Non-Stop Flight <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>(New York, 2nd National Dispatch) A mechanically manufactured pilot has conclusively demonstrated its ability to fly an aircraft in a variety of common flight environments. Today, it flew a full-metal aircraft from Los Angeles to New York in 13 hours and 25 minutes, not only creating a historic marvel but also setting a new record for non-stop flight. The famous aviator Hawks was on board, and according to him, he only gave instructions, leaving everything to the robot. He encountered no difficulties. Although the weather was not extremely bad, there were several places where the weather was enough to frighten an ordinary pilot, but the robot handled it with ease and accuracy. The aircraft arrived in New York at 11:16 p.m. tonight. This was a test, so all major airlines paid close attention. The aircraft is one of twenty newly built by American Airlines, with a speed of 170 miles per hour. It is reported that the regular scheduled airline time for passenger aircraft from Los Angeles to New York was recently reduced to 18 hours by various companies two weeks ago. Now, the mechanical pilot has traveled in only 13 and a half hours, and it is expected that it will be reduced even further soon.</p>
<p>Rumor that the Soviet Union is Distributing Gas Masks to Residents Around Chita</p>
<h3 id="e33">The Russian Consul in Harbin Secretly Withdraws <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Harbin) This morning, Koernitz, the Russian representative of the Chinese Eastern Railway, met with Li Shaogeng, the Director-General, to present an oral protest against the suspension of transportation at Suifenhe. It is claimed that this action has violated the 1925 agreement between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway and demands the immediate restoration of the original state. However, Li rejected it. Later, the Russian Consul-General also raised the same protest, but the "Manchukuo" representative regarded this as unofficial and said nothing. It is currently rumored that the Russian Consul here is secretly preparing to withdraw. According to Russian newspaper reports, the Soviet military authorities have distributed gas masks to residents in and around Chita. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government sent a document to the Soviet authorities on May 29, stating that it would do its best to persuade "Manchukuo" to buy the Chinese Eastern Railway according to the Soviet proposal. However, as of now, the Soviet Union has not responded. However, according to recent conversations between Soviet Ambassador Yurenev and Japanese Vice Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Mamoru, the Soviet authorities do not object to the Japanese government's proposal in principle. Therefore, once the Soviet reply arrives, formal negotiations will be conducted in Tokyo by Soviet Ambassador Yurenev, Japanese Director of the European Affairs Bureau Togo, and "Manchukuo" Vice Foreign Minister Ohashi. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the negotiations for the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Soviet Union's intention to respond to the Japanese side: As a result of the Soviet Ambassador to Japan's visit to Vice Minister Shigemitsu one day, it was generally agreed to with the Japanese response. In particular, there was no objection to Japan's mediation to begin negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway between Russia and Manchuria in Tokyo. Therefore, after the Soviet Union's official response, negotiations will begin in Tokyo between Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev, "Manchukuo's" Ding Shiyuan, and Japanese Director of the European and American Affairs Bureau Togo, around October 3rd. (3rd Denttsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) A letter received here from Khabarovsk states that the connecting line between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway has been blocked by the "Manchu" authorities in the area of Pogranichnaya, so transportation between the two railways has been completely halted. Rote, the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Administration, has asked the Board of Directors to find a way to restore normalcy. The disconnection of the two railways appears to have been carried out on May 31 by an armed police force led by Mr. Sato, a Japanese official from the "Manchu" Ministry of Transportation. They first demanded the keys to this connecting line from the stationmaster of Pogranichnaya Station, and then placed a large number of sleepers across the tracks at the junction of the two railways to prevent the passage of freight cars between the two railways. At that time, the police gave the stationmaster a certificate signed by "Manchu" officials. The certificate was signed by Sato (formerly an employee of the South Manchuria Railway), an official of the Ministry of Transportation, Yan Shiyuan (transliteration), the Director of the Road Police Bureau, and the White Russian Lonikov, the inspector of the fifth section. The certificate claimed to be protecting the property of the Chinese Eastern Railway. At the same time, the transport and transfer operations at Pogranichnaya Station were stopped. The stationmaster of Pogranichnaya Station lodged a serious protest with the "Manchu" authorities against this illegal action of destroying the transport agreement and disrupting the normal operations of the station, and returned the above-mentioned certificate, believing that this action was not in accordance with the procedures, and also hinted that if there was any change to the station affairs, they could directly contact the Railway Administration. Rote, the Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Administration, immediately reported the Pogranichnaya Station incident to the Board of Directors, saying that this action violated the commercial interests of the railway and its passengers, and that they should immediately find a way to restore Pogranichnaya Station's operations and continue the transport between the two railways to meet the urgent needs of cargo transportation. Rote also solemnly declared that this action has great importance in international relations. (2nd Tass Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) This week, The New Statesman and Nation's editorial criticized the Sino-Japanese armistice, stating that Japan's signing of the armistice is a clever policy. Before having further plans, its temporary mantra is peace and goodwill. Japan is following the same pattern and will soon use sweet words to induce some countries to recognize "Manchukuo." British public opinion should be wary of this strategy, but at the same time, it should understand the importance of seeking a better foundation for the conditions of peace in the Far East based on the Lytton Report. The Spectator stated that Nanjing's recent ineffective armed resistance is merely a gesture to seek understanding from China and sympathy. (2nd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Major Dark Secrets of American Banking Speculation</p>
<h3 id="e74">Is Mussolini Also Taking Public Bonds? <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Startling Exposures in the Morgan Case</p>
<p>(National News, Washington, 2nd) At a time when the US Senate is thoroughly investigating the methods by which bankers profit in the securities market, hoping to design measures to curb speculation, it is unexpected that the American public is flocking to the stock exchanges in major ports, hoping to strike it rich. Although no one dares to say that what the Senate committee has discovered has had the unintended effect of encouraging people to try again, the crowd of participants in transactions in the exchanges today is unprecedented since 1929. Leading speculators have consistently bought in, causing the price on the New York Stock Exchange to increase by one pound sterling to as much as nine pounds sterling. The offices of brokers are filled with male and female clients, all eager to choose stable securities and buy them. Even the commodities market is active as a result. As the Senate continues to thoroughly investigate the Morgan Banking Corporation today, it has been discovered that Morgan Bank and six other banks jointly acquired 1,146,609 shares when the securities market collapsed in 1929 with no way to raise it, in an attempt to save the market from collapse. Subsequently, when market prices rose slightly in 1930, they sold them and made a profit of $1,067,355. Suddenly, Senator McCreitz asked whether the account books of those enjoying special rights from the company included the names of King Vittorio Emanuele, Mussolini, and the British royal family. Investigator Picola replied that he had not seen them. Morgan Corporation shareholder Whitley replied that he did not know whether European royalty had stock accounts made on their behalf, but that there was no way to tell if there were no such arrangements. Subsequently, it was also discovered that the list of those favored by Morgan included famous American figures, from retiring presidents to political operatives, without exception. However, no foreign dignitaries have been discovered to date. Whenever there are securities that can be speculated on, the company notifies these individuals, who can often purchase them from Morgan Bank at prices far below market value.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Washington, 2nd) The rumor that Morgan Company sold securities at reduced prices to King Vittorio Emanuele and French politicians drew general attention today during the Senate's review of Morgan's business activities. This claim was made by Senator Reynolds, but Morgan Company shareholder Whitney strongly denied it and promised to present a list showing how securities sent to England and France were distributed. Reynolds's question contained political implications, suggesting that international bankers such as Morgan Company were lobbying to cancel war debts in order to protect their investments in Europe. Whitney replied that he believed the distribution of stocks had nothing to do with war debts and did not harm American interests.</p>
<p>(Reuters, New York, 2nd) The grand jury today brought another public lawsuit against Harriman, the manager of the former Harriman National Bank and Trust Company, for falsifying bank records. It is reported that Harriman was charged in March of this year for falsifying records totaling $1,661,000 in an attempt to deceive currency accountants. After being charged, he was released on bail. He suddenly disappeared last month but was eventually found by police in the Rosslyn Hotel on Catalina Island. When the police arrived at the hotel, Harriman cried and stabbed himself in the heart with a knife in an attempt to commit suicide. He was then sent to Manila Hospital for treatment. Harriman left a letter in the room asking someone to inform his relatives. The next day, the authorities immediately ordered that if Harriman attempted to escape, he should be arrested.</p>

<p>Ten Major Oil Wells Blaze into the Sky</p>
<p>The Flames Spread, Turning the Area into a Sea of Fire</p>
<p>Reports of Twenty Fatalities</p>
<p>(National News, Long Beach (California), 2nd) A major fire broke out at the famous Signal Hill oil field here this afternoon. Flames from ten major oil wells shot into the sky. The wind fanned the flames, spreading the fire toward the oil storage tanks. As a result, fire-fighting forces, the army, and the police were divided into two groups. One group closed off the oil wells that were already on fire and those that were not yet on fire, and the other group opened the oil tanks, pouring millions of gallons of kerosene into the Pacific Ocean. In addition, because the existing pipelines for transporting kerosene to ships were not discharging quickly enough, holes were drilled in the bottom of the tanks, allowing the kerosene to flow through two city streets into the ocean. At one point, the oil was two feet deep in the streets. Although this loss is significant, it prevented the entire mine from being completely destroyed. The rescue efforts were largely extinguished by the evening, with only a few wells still smoldering. The fire was caused by an explosion at a distillery. The force of the explosion shook the area within a twenty-five-mile radius. Three hundred sailors not far from the oil field were knocked to the ground. There are reports of twenty fatalities, and seven bodies have already been recovered. The flames spread from the oil factory to the oil wells and the accumulated waste oil on the ground, turning the area into a sea of fire. Fortunately, large contingents of military police arrived to rescue within a few minutes.</p>

<p>Bankers' Berlin Conference Concludes</p>
<h3 id="e77">Decision on Germany's Debt Relief Measures <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>France Believes it Does Not Affect the Young Plan</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 2nd) A deferred payment plan for Germany's long-term and short-term foreign debt is expected to be announced soon, approximately after Pentecost. This statement was made today by Schacht, the president of the German National Bank, to foreign journalists here. The meeting of foreign bankers in Berlin concluded today. Schacht explained the significance of this meeting, saying that the German National Bank has firmly decided not to allow its foreign currency reserves to shrink further, and that ordinary import and export credit must be maintained. Germany is willing to repay its debts but must have the opportunity to earn money to pay them. The stability of the German currency must be maintained under any circumstances. The importance of Schacht's remarks about debt relief can be seen in the amount of debt that Germany must repay this year. The total amount of German debt is approximately 20,000,000,000 marks, of which 65,000,000 pounds are due this year. The largest debt is owed to the United States, totaling 8,016,000,000 marks, followed by the Netherlands, totaling 3,427,000,000 marks, and then the United Kingdom, totaling 2,231,000,000 marks. The current difficulty is due to the significant decline in German trade. The National Bank's banknote reserve is only 8.3%, while the statutory minimum reserve is 40%. Although Schacht did not explicitly state a deferral of payment, those who heard his words interpreted it that way. The foreign bankers' conference, which considered the matter of Germany's foreign debt repayment, unanimously passed a document today expressing agreement on the need for the German National Bank to gradually increase its cash and foreign currency reserves and acknowledging the need to consider how to protect and expand Germany's foreign exchange reserves due to the decrease in Germany's foreign trade surplus, which is insufficient to repay its debts. The document also announced that a permanent small group representing long-term creditors would be in constant contact with the German National Bank, and that short-term creditors would also have a fixed committee in contact with the bank. The document concluded that international debt issues could only be resolved by the flow of goods and the reorganization of debt repayment methods, and it was believed that one of the greatest objectives of the World Economic Conference would be to facilitate the rapid and permanent resolution of Germany's transit problems.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 2nd) It is expected that a debt relief measure will be announced next week, but it is not a general relief. Schacht will announce a deferral of principal repayment but will endeavor to repay part of the interest in foreign currency, with the remaining interest to be repaid in marks that must be used in Germany. As for the repayment of the Dawes and Young loans, they are not affected at present. American representatives attending the bankers' conference have stated that if Schacht announces a general moratorium, American bondholders are prepared to seize any assets in the United States of German businesses that do not pay their bonds.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Paris, 2nd) The official sector here has expressed little reaction to the remarks of Schacht, president of the German National Bank, believing that these remarks refer only to the German government's private debts and do not involve the bonds of the Young Plan.</p>
<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 3rd) German newspapers commenting on the debt relief measures to be announced stated that the plan foreshadowed by Schacht, president of the National Bank, is absolutely necessary and must be implemented for the sake of protecting both creditors and debtors until an agreement is reached with creditors on a solution that Germany can tolerate. The Börsen-Zeitung stated that the final decision on Germany's ability to pay its debts belongs to the World Economic Conference. If the conference properly manages international trade relations, its decision will be positive. However, if the politicians of various countries do not replace the current policies with constructive policies, their decision will be negative.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Pion, 3rd) William, the grandson of the German ex-Crown Prince and the eldest son of the German ex-Prince, married Ms. Cäcilie von Savoie-Aosta here this morning at the town hall. A large crowd watched outside the hall, and the ceremony was simple. The officiant was a registrar official, and the witnesses were the bride's brother and Count von Blumenthal. After the ceremony, they went to the bride's mother's house in the same car for a religious wedding ceremony. The bride is a descendant of Italian nobles who later moved to Germany. Members of the ex-royal family do not approve of the ex-Crown Prince's grandson marrying a commoner, so if Germany is restored in the future, the ex-Crown Prince's grandson will lose his right to inherit the throne.</p>
<h3 id="e79">Japanese Political Turmoil <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>(Denpō, Tokyo, 3rd) The conflict between the radical and self-respecting factions within the Seiyūkai, led by President Suzuki Kisaburō, regarding the reorganization of the party, led to a request for mediation from Mochizuki Keisuke. Mochizuki stated that hasty mediation at this time would be inappropriate, so the president postponed a decision, intending to adopt a wait-and-see attitude to understand the party's direction. However, the radical faction, which had previously acknowledged the weakness of the current cabinet at a cadre meeting and decided that the Seiyūkai should adopt a policy of independent progress, now suddenly fears party turmoil and burying itself in doubt, which would be a disgrace to the world, so they are extremely dissatisfied and will begin a fierce resistance movement. In particular, Shimada Toshiwo and Yamaguchi Giichi are enthusiastic about the argument for a national cabinet based on party mergers or party alliances. Yamamoto Jōtarō and other former Seiyūkai members, as well as Kuhara Fusanosuke, have also expressed their support. Even Tokonami Takejirō and Mochizuki, if President Suzuki is determined to do so, will express their support. The argument for a coalition cabinet has gradually gained strength within the party, so the timing of President Suzuki's decision, regardless of its content, is expected to be in early or late June, but may be delayed by one or two months. For the time being, the status quo will be maintained.</p>
<p>(Denpō, Tokyo, 3rd) Seiyūkai elders Okazaki, Mochizuki, and Sunada met at the Kōjunsya this afternoon at 1:30 PM to discuss the issue of severing ties with the government. As a result, they reached a consensus that the party must be united at this time regardless. However, if they disregard the decisions made at the cadre meeting, it will affect the party's credibility, and the arguments of the self-respecting faction are also quite reasonable, so they cannot be ignored. As a result, both factions should show mutual respect and make the best efforts for the future of the party with a compromising attitude.</p>
<p>(Denpō, Tokyo, 3rd) Seiyūkai's radical faction members Sunada Shigemasa and Okada Tadahiko visited President Suzuki this morning at 10:30 AM to state their strong opinions, saying that the self-respecting faction is currently plotting, and they hope to follow the main purpose of the cadre meeting's decision, without harming the party's image, and decisively sever ties with the current cabinet. The severance faction has always wanted to implement its original intentions, while the middle-ranking group gathered at the Kawachiya in Tsukiji tonight, and the radical faction also gathered at the Kōrakukan in Akasaka. The self-respecting faction also gathered at the Miyuki-en in Shiba to discuss.</p>
<p>(Denpō, Tokyo, 3rd) As of last night, the Seiyūkai's self-respecting faction seemed to have the upper hand. The radical faction, stimulated, suddenly turned the tables and is also dissatisfied with Mochizuki, and will take more active actions, deciding on major expansion at Kawachiya and Kōrakukan tonight. Therefore, the power of the severance faction and the self-respecting faction are equal, and the situation is chaotic. President Suzuki will not make an easy decision before clarifying the trend of the general situation. However, since the cadre meeting has already made a decision, he cannot completely ignore it, because it concerns the party's image and the president's prestige. However, the idea of a coalition cabinet will be considered again in the event of a political change, and today's issue is a separate matter.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Soviet Perspective on the World Economic Crisis <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>(TASS, Moscow) An article published in Pravda here laments the terrible state of the capitalist world economic crisis over the past three years, as well as the current destruction of machinery aimed at hindering production and technological progress. Regarding the United States, the newspaper states that even in this most advanced and magnificent capitalist country, various types of production are undergoing unparalleled declines. In 1932, cast iron production was only 80% of that in 1929, equivalent to the level of 1896. During the same period, steel production decreased by 76%. The utilization of open-hearth furnaces was only 14% of their total capacity. The automotive industry, which requires the most metal, produced only 75% of what it did in 1929, so the demand for metal also decreased sharply. Railway transport volume decreased by half, electricity production decreased by 25%, and only one-fifth of the country's electrical industry is operating. The decline in other sectors of the machinery manufacturing industry is even more severe, with many parts only operating at 5% to 10%. Pravda continues, although the development of various countries and sectors of industry in the world is extremely unbalanced, the situation in other capitalist countries is no better than in the United States. The German Economic Research Institute published the following table, indicating the workload of major industries worldwide in 1932:</p>
<p>Coal Mining Industry: 48.7% Machinery Manufacturing Industry: 27.1% Construction Industry: 22.7% Heavy Industry: 31.3% Light Industry: 42.1% Since capitalist countries are unable to utilize one-third of their original production capacity and are unable to sell their mountains of surplus goods, they have no choice but to intensify the destruction of their industrial organizations and destroy their products. Ford recently set up a machine specifically for destroying automobiles in one or two factories. This technical achievement is a clear illustration of the destruction of productive forces in the darkness of capitalism. In the current capitalist arena, all technical considerations and construction work are concentrated on how to destroy active machines and how to limit the development of productive forces. The unity of this contradiction in technical development is most obvious. Capitalism plunges millions of people into a state of unemployment and starvation, and the unemployed and starving masses are not limited to the proletariat. The vast majority of farmers, most of the agency employees, intellectuals, scientists, and engineers are also in this situation.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Agreement Signed, Hearts in Tianjin and Beijing Stabilized <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Strict Precautions in Beijing, Public Security Uncompromised</p>
<p>Traffic Gradually Resumes Former Appearance</p>
<p>Refugees from War Zones Return in Succession</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beijing: The Sino-Japanese armistice issue, after two meetings between representatives Xiong Bin and Okamura, etc., in Tanggu, was signed with extreme speed. The content of the agreement is divided into five articles. Our army will withdraw from the area west and south of the line connecting Yanqing, Changping, Gaoliying, Shunyi, Tongzhou, Xianghe, Baodi, Lintingkou, Ninghe, and Lutai and will not advance further, nor engage in any provocative or disruptive actions. After the above agreement is implemented, the Japanese army will not pursue beyond the line and will automatically return to the Great Wall line. Japanese aircraft will also be allowed to inspect at any time, and China should provide protection. Our representative, after signing yesterday (the 31st) afternoon, immediately returned to Beijing. Although there are still unfinished matters between the Chinese and Japanese armies that need final consultation in Tianjin, the peace movement that has been brewing for many days has finally been successful.</p>
<p>Since the authorities began ceasefire negotiations, the hearts of the Beijing people have been slightly stabilized. After the news of the signing of the agreement was revealed in the newspapers this morning, the momentary feelings of shock and fear completely disappeared. In places such as East and West Chang'an Streets, the traffic was bustling, and a thriving atmosphere suddenly appeared. Modern men and women are active again. Although general entertainment venues have not yet returned to their former appearance, famous actors such as Xun Huisheng, Yang Xiaolou, and Ma Lianliang have all posted playbills and will choose a date to perform. It is expected that peace will be seen again within a few days, and there will be no more loneliness. Japanese military aircraft appeared in the skies over Beijing yesterday and today (the 1st). The time of their arrival has been around 11:00 AM and has never changed. They may still fly in for inspection afterward. Since the purpose is benevolent, the Chinese side should provide protection at all times, so the act of bombing should not occur. The public regards it as a commonplace event, completely different from the nature of the initial sighting of Japanese aircraft, so it can be treated with composure.</p>
<p>Because various counties in Hebei were once battlefields between the Chinese and Japanese armies, civilian dwellings and fields were either occupied by soldiers or destroyed by artillery fire. The people had nowhere to return and fled to Beijing one after another. When the war situation at the front was urgent, the number of refugees arriving in Beijing exceeded tens of thousands. Various parties organized reception centers to take in the old and weak. It is estimated that charitable organizations have established refugee reception centers attached to the Poor People's Warm Factory and reception centers of local associations and the Red Swastika Society, etc. In particular, the Red Swastika Society's organization is the largest in scale. In addition to the New World, there are Guanghua Temple, Longquan Orphanage, Qinglong Bridge, and other places that accommodate refugees. At the peak, it reached more than two thousand people, not including other places. Now that the situation is gradually stabilizing, many refugees have returned home in succession. There are very few refugees left in the reception centers. However, the autumn harvest is hopeless this year, and the future panic in the war zone is difficult to imagine. Various charitable organizations are now planning relief measures in advance, and government offices are also coordinating post-disaster measures. The losses of the people will be difficult to compensate in a short period of time.</p>
<p>Large armies gathered in the suburbs of Beijing, and the locations where they were stationed mostly borrowed civilian houses. Recently, the above situation has also occurred in various places in the city. Although the authorities have ordered relocation, most have not yet moved out. Some troops have also borrowed temples for lodging. There is a shortage of public housing for distribution. The overall discipline is still strict, and there is no disturbance to the people, so the military and civilians can get along fairly well. However, the security in the areas where the troops are stationed is extremely tight. Every night after 8:00 PM, additional sentries are assigned near the garrison, carrying guns and ammunition, to check pedestrians. After 10:00 PM, traffic is prohibited. Therefore, although the curfew time is officially set at 11:00 PM at night, there are few people in the secluded alleys after dusk. In order to protect safety, sandbags that were piled up in front of important places have not been removed. The military and police are stepping up patrol duties every night and are not relaxing at all. Although the Sino-Japanese war has stopped, unscrupulous traitors still have the possibility of acting erratically and must be carefully guarded against. It is heard that Li Jichun and Shi Yousan's gangs are still active. After Shi's failed riot in Tianjin, he has now fled to Qinhuangdao and dares to openly issue conscription notices. The authorities are now trying to crack down on them, and it is expected that it will not affect the current situation. (June 1)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Yan's Attitude in Shanxi Amidst the Changing Situation <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Representatives from All Sides Gather in Taiyuan</p>
<p>Defensive Arrangements Made for the Shanxi-Suiyuan Border</p>
<p>Correspondence from Taiyuan: The long-silent Taiyuan has recently shown signs of activity due to a telegram from Feng Yuxiang in Zhangjiakou, assuming the position of Commander-in-Chief of the People's Anti-Japanese Allied Army. This kind of brewing had been repeatedly discussed and closely watched by the government in the previous few days. Feng's telegram arrived in Taiyuan on the 27th, and the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters immediately convened a meeting to discuss countermeasures. However, the outcome of the consultation is rarely known to the outside world. The original text of the telegram was first published by various newspapers on the 29th. At the same time, He Jingwu, Chairman of the Pinghan Railway, also came to Taiyuan from Chiang Kai-shek to visit Yan and discuss the situation. He was in a hurry and only stayed in Taiyuan for one night. When he arrived in Taiyuan last night with Wang Maogong, Director of the Zhengtai Railway Bureau, military and political figures such as Xu Yongchang, Chairman of Shanxi Province, Zhao Daiwen, Chief Counselor of the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters, Yang Aiyuan, Qingxiang Supervisory Officer, and Rong Honglu, Garrison Commander, all went to the station to greet him. Then, they had a long conversation with the welcomers at the Shanxi Grand Hotel. This morning, He personally visited Yan at the Suiyuan Pacification Headquarters for about two hours, and then took the Zhengtai midday train to leave Taiyuan. Xu, Zhao, Yang, and others all went to the station to see him off. It is unknown what He's mission was and what the outcome of his meeting with Yan was. Yan's attitude is still focused on carrying out his ten-year plan and has little expression on the current situation, with a strong intention to remain silent about politics. However, since Feng's attitude has been clearly expressed, it is worth studying how Shanxi and Chahar, due to their geographical environment, will respond. According to general observations, Shanxi may eventually find it difficult to remain silent. Sun Chu, Commander of the Zhengtai Road Protection Army, was appointed by Yan a few days ago as the Commander of the Shanxi-Chahar-Suiyuan Border Defense. Sun's Ma Brigade departed from Taiyuan to Datong. Sun and Brigade Commander Ma Yanshou also went to Datong together a few days ago to inspect their troops and convene a meeting of officers above the regimental level stationed in that area. It is heard that considerable arrangements have been made for the Shanxi-Suiyuan border defense. Sun's troops remaining in the province have continued to move north in the past day or two. Also, Lu Xiuwen, representative of Song Zheyuan, and Xiang Chengren, representative of Yang Hucheng, also came to Taiyuan today to visit Yan and discuss the situation. The society is paying close attention to the comings and goings of representatives from all sides, because the residents have become startled birds due to years of war, and are therefore uneasy about the recent future situation.

<h3 id="e90">Various Important Proposals Passed <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>In addition to the proposals to reduce the mineral tax standard to 20/1000 and the freight rate on each road to 5 cents per ton per kilometer, the official meeting held from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM yesterday passed the following proposals from each road: (1) Due to the national industrial and commercial depression and low coal prices, the Ministry of Railways should be requested to reduce freight rates to maintain them. (2) Request the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to investigate the national coal consumption and stipulate the output of each mine to balance supply and demand and maintain the business of each mine. (3) Increase the import tax rate on foreign coal to protect the domestic coal industry. (4) Propose to specially reduce and unify the coal transportation prices on the Zhengtai Road. (5) Request to uniformly allocate vehicles to each mine.

If it is unavoidable, please stipulate the lowest price to avoid the road side from gaining the sole profit and the mine side from suffering the sole loss. Please consult the Ministry to instruct the Ministry of Railways to comply. (14) The relationship between Daoqing Road and Zhongyuan Company is too close. Please restore the special price for coal transportation at Daokou Sanliwan and the special price for transfer at the new station from now on to avoid stockpiling costs and alleviate the difficulties of the mine. Please consult the Ministry to order the Ministry of Railways to comply. (15) The prices of coal transportation on the Beijing-Shenyang, Tianjin-Pukou, and Longhai Railways are very high. In order to promote domestic goods and resist foreign coal, they should all be reduced uniformly or specially stipulated. Please consult the Ministry for appropriate discretion.</p>

<p>Southwest Five Provinces</p>
<h3 id="e94">Planning the Qinzhou-Chongqing Railway <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Committee Established After Several Consultations</p>
<p>Correspondence from Chongqing: The joint planning of the Qinzhou-Chongqing Railway by Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Guangdong, and Guangxi provinces has been publicized for a long time. Representatives from the five provinces had several consultations in Guangzhou, which were quite promising, and a preparatory committee was established to carry out various tasks. Chen Jitang of Guangdong, in order to promote the realization of the road in the shortest possible time, sent representatives Mai Huanzhang and Hu Weisan from Guangdong to Sichuan to contact the military leaders in Sichuan. After Mai and Hu arrived in Chongqing, they immediately visited Liu Xiang, the Pacification Director of Sichuan, to discuss various matters, which was quite satisfactory. Liu agreed to allocate 1 million yuan of railway shares and expressed his willingness to fully support the realization of the road. Mai and Hu then rushed to Chengdu to ask Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army, Deng Xihou of the 28th Army, and Tian Songyao of the 29th Army to express their sympathy and support for the road construction. However, after several visits, there was no satisfactory reply, because the generals of the province were currently busy solving their own survival problems and had no time to take care of road construction. Mai and Hu then went to Qingcheng for sightseeing and planned to visit Mount Emei, but they returned to Chongqing due to the war. According to reports, the authorities in Guangdong and Guangxi have detailed regulations for the road construction plan. Guangdong and Guangxi are responsible for self-construction. The section from Sanshui to Wuzhou already has a railway. An Xingye Bank has been established with a capital of 8 million yuan, which is borne by Guangdong for 5 million yuan and Guangxi for 3 million yuan. In the future, this will be used as a road construction fund. After the successful opening of the section from Sanshui to Wuzhou, the income will be used to gradually plan other sections. When there is insufficient funding, small loans can be made to overseas Chinese, and negotiations can be made with foreign merchants to order rails and vehicles. If foreign merchants can provide assistance and are willing to lend money for rails and vehicles, the progress will be smoother. As for the route problem, Yunnan insisted on first repairing the section from Kunming to Qinzhou, because Qinzhou is China's own seaport. If the section from Kunming to Sichuan is repaired first, it is equivalent to extending the French Yunnan-Vietnam railway and increasing its power to invade the hinterland. Therefore, if Yunnan is passed without repairing the seaport for Yunnan first, Yunnan will definitely disagree. The current plan is to start from Sanshui on the Guangzhou-Sanshui Road, pass through Wuzhou and Liuzhou in Guangxi, and enter Guizhou, pass through Guiyang and enter Chongqing and Chengdu in Sichuan, and then connect to Kunming in Yunnan west of Guiyang and reach Changsha in southern Hunan. However, each section of this route may be separately funded and started. Those with surplus funds will start first, and then plan to extend them. Generally speaking, the cost of building the Qinzhou-Chongqing Railway is about 200,000 yuan per mile (about three Chinese miles). If there is already a road foundation, the cost will be greatly reduced. (May 29)</p>
<p>Huai River Commission Investigation</p>
<h3 id="e95">Water Conservancy Projects in Various Counties Along the Huai River in Shandong Province <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Correspondence from Jinan: The Huai River Basin concerns the interests of several provinces. The Huai River Commission has been actively preparing for rectification over the years and is now investigating the relevant water conservancy projects in each county for reference. The provincial government of this province received a consultation from the association yesterday, roughly saying that all water conservancy projects belonging to the Huai River Basin are closely related to the Huai River planning of the association. In recent years, there must be many places where the local government and the people can concentrate their efforts to effectively implement the river channels, ponds, and embankments within the territory. The association wants to clarify the implementation results of the water conservancy projects in various places along the Huai River for reference, and specially formulated a survey form on the overview of the water conservancy projects in each county and consulted the noble provincial government to order the competent authorities to print and distribute the form sent by the association to the counties along the Huai River under its jurisdiction and order them to conduct detailed surveys and send them directly to the association for collation, and also order each county to report any water conservancy projects that are continued to be undertaken in the future. According to this, the provincial government should order the Construction Department to investigate and handle it. After receiving the order, the Construction Department should take the Grand Canal, Si River, Yi River, and Shu River in the southwest of the province as the upper reaches of the Huai River and have a network connection with the Huai River. Then, according to the Yun River, Si River, Yi River, Shu River, and other twenty-nine counties, according to the survey form on the overview of local water conservancy projects sent by the Huai River Association, the inquiry should be completed and reported to the department within ten days of the arrival of the document so that it can be collected and forwarded to the association.

<h3 id="e98">Labor-Capital Dispute at Hankou Zhenhuan Factory Resolved <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Work Resumption Scheduled as Result of Labor-Capital Negotiations</p>
<p>Minsheng Textile Company Announces Another Shutdown</p>
<p>Correspondence from Hankou: After the 3,000 workers of Zhenhuan Yarn Factory appealed and the Provincial Party Department and the Provincial Government accepted the request, they ordered the factory to resume operation. Labor and capital, and representatives of various parties, held negotiations. The Construction Department and the Trade Union also sent representatives to participate. After several consultations, two compromise solutions were decided: (1) It was stipulated that one and a half months would be the shutdown period for the factory to clear accounts and raise additional capital, until July 14th. Work will officially resume on the 15th. (2) During the shutdown period, the factory will pay a subsidy of 40% of the total monthly wages of the workers to maintain the workers' lives. Both parties agreed, signed on the 30th, and reported it to the Party, government, and military agencies for record. The turmoil was peacefully resolved. But just as one wave subsided, another wave rose. Minsheng Yarn Factory suddenly decided to shut down on June 1st due to poor business operations and separately submitted reports to the Finance and Construction Departments on the 30th, stating that they would stop paying rent from June 1st (the factory was originally owned by the province, and the Minsheng Company was leasing it from the provincial government). According to the factory, on April 30th, wages were reduced, and salary deductions caused a conflict with the workers, which led to the military police opening fire and causing a tragedy. Not even a month later, it was announced that it would shut down, which was not what the workers were willing to accept. The labor unrest in Wuhan may be on the rise. (May 30)</p>

<p>Chen Zhongchao, a native of Jiangbei, at Fei Tongxing Rice Mill outside the South Gate's Datie Bridge, started a fight with Ji Yaohua and Bian Hongkui over gambling debts. Chen fell ill and died. His brother, Zhongjie, according to his fellow villager Liu Jingshou, was willing to testify and reported to the Prosecutor's Office for investigation. Today (the 3rd) at 8:00 AM, Prosecutor Zhu, together with Secretary Qian and the inspectors, rushed to the Second District Office to summon a group of witnesses, ordered the coffin to be opened for inspection, and verified that there were slight injuries on the neck of the deceased, but they were not fatal. The cause of death was clarified, and the local police were ordered to coffin and bury the body, and the suspects Liu and Ji were taken back into custody for interrogation.</p>

<p>After Hu Lifu, a traitor, was arrested in Shanghai and sent to the Jiangsu Higher Court for trial, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. Hu immediately declared his disagreement and appealed to the Supreme Court. He was then sentenced by the court to revoke the judgment of the first instance and change the sentence to Hu Lifu's death. The judgment was sent to Hu's family by the Suzhou Higher Court the day before yesterday. Yesterday (the 3rd) morning, the Procuratorate of the Higher Court received an order from the Ministry to execute Hu and executed it at 1:30 PM under the supervision of Prosecutor Zhu Wenzhuo, the supervising execution officer, to the Third Prison on Siqian Street to bring Hu out to verify his identity. When the traitor Hu Lifu was executed by hanging (photographed by Lin Xuehuai), he found 10 yuan in his pocket. Hu knew that his death day had arrived, and he could not help but feel sad and shed tears. Before the execution, the supervising execution officer asked if there were any last words. Hu shook his head and sighed and said, "I sold the land to relieve the refugees. Now I have such a result. It is really dark and there is no day. What else is there to say? I can only go to the underworld to file a complaint." He only asked the court to send a letter to his family in Shanghai to come and collect the body and instructed them to be buried in his hometown. After saying that, he kept shaking his head. The supervising execution officer then ordered Hu to be hoisted onto the gallows and executed by hanging according to the law.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Bandit Gang Robbery and Assault <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>In the first district of this county, Youdu Village, 584th map, the second house west of the bridge, villager Lu Panfu, is currently a foreman at the Qingfeng Yarn Factory, and his son Agou is a worker in the fine yarn section of the Guangqin Yarn Factory. Their family life is barely sustainable. Agou got married in March of this year. Yesterday (the 3rd) at 1:00 AM, suddenly six bandits, each wielding a handgun, arrived at the village. First, they opened the front door of the neighboring first house, the home of You Asan. You heard the noise and went to investigate, but was shot in the abdomen by the bandits. The bullet entered his waist and did not exit. Immediately afterward, they opened the Lu family's front door. Two bandits stood guard outside, while four bandits entered the house. First, they went to Lu Panfu's bedroom on the front floor to rob him, then they went to Lu Agou's room on the back floor to search and plunder. Agou put up some resistance and was also shot, the bullet entering his nose and exiting his neck. He fell to the ground in a pool of blood, unconscious. They robbed him of forty-three yuan in cash, a watch, and some Xiangyun gauze clothing, for a total loss of over one hundred yuan. After obtaining their loot, the bandits fled toward the Lengdu Harbor area. After the incident, You and Lu were injured. Their family members carried them to the city overnight and admitted them to Puren Hospital for treatment. According to the doctors, You Asan's injuries are light and should not be a major concern. Lu Agou's injuries are very serious and may be life-threatening. Yu Shuming, a patrol officer from the first police substation directly under the jurisdiction of the area, upon hearing about the major robbery and assault case, immediately led police officers to investigate the scene. They found five spent handgun cartridges left behind by the bandits. While pursuing the stolen goods and robbers, they apprehended one suspect and took him into custody. Furthermore, at Liu Fuquan's home in Hui Lane, Lengdu Township, 587th map of the second district, several bandits also arrived that evening and robbed them of a pair of gold bracelets and several articles of clothing. Additionally, at the home of Hua Yaoyu, a resident of Changjiang Village near Zhangcun Town in the fifth district, over ten bandits climbed over the wall and entered, stealing over one hundred yuan.</p>

<p>The Wuyi four-township cocoon market is most prosperous in the southeast township. Due to the impact of last year's declining cocoon market, the number of silk farmers in the northwest and northeast townships is very small this spring. However, the quality of fresh cocoons produced in various townships this year is good. Although there are fewer farmers, the output is still good. There are over 170 cocoon merchants in the county, with about two-thirds having opened for business. In the eastern township, the Henglin Qishuyan area opened for business on June 1st. There was not much activity until the 2nd. Today (the 3rd) there are more goods arriving. Native cocoons are around thirty yuan, and improved varieties are around forty yuan. The western township opened for business one day later than the eastern township. As of the 2nd, there were still not many goods being collected.</p>

<p>In Nantong's Lusi, after merchants and residents were robbed by mutinous soldiers from the Provincial Security Coastal Patrol Brigade, the county government, following provincial orders, investigated and found that merchants and residents had lost a total of 240,000 yuan. It also formulated relief standards: those who are extremely poor will receive full relief, and those who are less poor will receive 70% relief. The list will be submitted to the province for review and approval.</p>

<p>The fourth anti-narcotics division of this county has a branch in Jingjiang. On the 30th of last month, Zhang Luxuan, the acting director, sent personnel to the Yin family west of the Liedi Temple outside the north gate to search for opium, but found nothing. They arrested Wei Qinglang, a servant of the family, and took him to the branch, where he was subjected to private torture and beatings. He died at midnight. Later, the body was suddenly discovered in Yangshi Harbor. One morning, a trash picker named Shi Shunlang spotted it and reported it to the Public Security Bureau. The incident alarmed the public, who flocked to the anti-narcotics division and the Hefeng Opium Company. Over ten employees and officers were arrested and placed under the custody of the Public Security Bureau. On the 1st, County Magistrate Chen appointed Judge Bao and Examiner Cao to go to the west gate to examine the body. The examination revealed that the deceased had a wooden stick injury on his right forehead, two wooden stick injuries on his left ribs, a fist injury on his right ribs, and two stabbing injuries on his arm. It was determined that the injuries were inflicted before death, and the deceased fell into the river and died. After the examination, the deceased's wife, Wang, collected the body. At 1:00 PM, the Public Security Bureau transferred the personnel from the anti-narcotics division and the Hefeng Opium Company to the county, where they were interrogated by Judge Bao. Zhang Luxuan and others only admitted that after Wei Qinglang was arrested, he was handed over to Zhang Jingran for custody and then locked in a detention center. They claimed that they did not interrogate him and were unaware of his disappearance at 3:00 PM on the 31st. They suggested that the injuries on his body were likely caused by bamboo poles during the retrieval process. The most ridiculous thing was that a general affairs officer named Peng Changxia from Rugao disguised himself as a woman and fled after the incident, but was still captured. During the court hearing, he was still in women's clothing. After the interrogation, County Magistrate Chen stated that since the anti-narcotics division was established by provincial order, it was not appropriate to detain the acting director, Zhang Luxuan. The remaining personnel were placed under the custody of the Public Security Bureau, and the details of the case were telegraphed to the Civil Affairs Department of the provincial government for instructions.</p>

<p>One night, in the Yangfan Mine area of West Xiaojiang, a night boat sailing from Shaoxing to Xixing was robbed by two bandit boats carrying over ten bandits. The over twenty passengers on the boat had all their luggage and money, totaling over one hundred yuan, searched and robbed. One peddler, who had over one hundred and fifty yuan robbed, was so filled with regret that he jumped into the river to commit suicide. Fortunately, the boatmen worked hard to pull him out, preventing him from drowning.</p>

<p>The Chinese National Anti-Drug Association has always been determined to fundamentally eliminate drugs. However, due to environmental pressures this year, it has been unable to actively work. Yesterday, for the Opium Suppression Commemoration Day, the association originally planned to hold a grand anti-drug campaign in conjunction with all sectors of society, but the plan did not materialize. Instead, they only held a commemoration meeting at the association's headquarters. At 2:00 PM, the association's Secretary-General, Huang JiaHui, convened all staff members to hold a meeting, paying respects to the portrait of Lin WenZhong and speaking about Lin's burning of opium at Humen and the current state of the opium scourge in our country. The ceremony was simple and concluded at 3:00 PM.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Has the Best Results, Hubei and Jiangsu Are Next</p>
<p>Ministry of Interior Urges Provinces to Proceed</p>
<p>Gan Naiguang, the Vice Minister of the Interior, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday morning and returned to his private residence on Avenue Foch. Soon after, because the Minister of the Interior, Huang Shaoxiong, was about to go to Fujian, he visited Huang at his residence on Rue de l'Eglise to discuss departmental affairs for two hours before returning. A Central News Agency reporter visited him at his residence and asked about local autonomy and other matters. His remarks are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e117">Local Autonomy Achievements in Various Provinces <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>According to Gan, the importance of local autonomy is well known. Since the Ministry of the Interior took over the project, all provinces have earnestly complied. Although it has not yet been fully achieved, all provinces have made considerable progress. According to internal surveys, Zhejiang Province has achieved the best results in local autonomy, followed by Hubei. Jiangsu Province has made less progress due to various difficulties. Zhejiang Province has completed 70-80% of local autonomy. According to the laws and regulations promulgated by the central government, local areas in all provinces must complete local autonomy by 1934. Whether they can be completed as scheduled cannot be determined at this time.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Urging Provinces to Proceed <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The scope of local autonomy includes sanitation, water conservancy, transportation, fisheries, animal husbandry, and mining area management. Therefore, the scope is very broad, and it is difficult to implement. The Ministry of the Interior can only uphold the central government's intentions and work hard to urge the provinces to proceed. As for the local autonomy pilot zone in Guangxi Province, the results of the survey are excellent. The Ministry of the Interior will also gradually implement local autonomy in Hunan and other provinces.</p>

<p>The various resolutions passed at the Second National Conference on Internal Affairs have been implemented one by one. The reorganization of local defense corps organizations has also begun. Local defense corps not only protect the local area but also promote the martial spirit of the Chinese people. Therefore, the reorganization of the corps is an urgent matter. It was also learned that Gan will return to Nanjing on Monday due to busy departmental affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Shao Lizi Discusses the Shaanxi Disaster <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Came to Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Negotiate Relief Funds</p>
<p>Returning to Nanjing Tonight, Going to Shaanxi on the 8th</p>
<p>Shao Lizi, the newly appointed Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, arrived in Shanghai by overnight train from Nanjing the night before last. He arrived at the North Station at around 8:00 AM yesterday morning and immediately returned to his residence to rest. A Central News Agency reporter visited Shao at his residence yesterday morning and asked about the recent situation in Shaanxi and the date of his assumption of office. He provided a detailed response as follows:</p>
<p>Shaanxi Disaster is Severe According to Shao, Shaanxi has suffered from droughts for many years. The disaster area is large, and there are many victims. Although various charitable organizations have repeatedly provided relief, it is a drop in the bucket and does not solve the problem. Recently, Shaanxi Province has received timely rain, hoping that this year's autumn harvest will be promising and the people's difficulties will be slightly alleviated. However, an unexpected event occurred. I recently received a telegram from Director Yang Hucheng stating that Shaanxi Province was hit by a wind disaster last month, and the wheat harvest is completely hopeless. The only way to provide relief at present is to replant. However, the farmers' seeds, tools, and livestock have long been lost. Although they have the desire to replant, they do not have the ability to do so. They can only look up at the sky and sigh, waiting to die. It is expected that this year's disaster will be even more severe than in previous years, and there will definitely be more victims than in previous years.</p>
<p>Planning for Relief Shao continued, "My biggest task in going to Shaanxi this time is to provide disaster relief. The reason why I have been delayed is that I am busy negotiating relief matters. The Central Party Headquarters previously allocated 20,000 yuan for disaster relief in Shaanxi, and has now decided to allocate another 50,000 yuan to purchase seeds for disaster relief. I have contacted various charitable organizations in Shanghai and asked them to provide relief. The charitable organizations also recognize the severity of the disaster in Shaanxi and are actively planning and trying to provide relief. The commissions earned from today's (3rd) Golden Goblet Champagne Race, which were originally intended to be used for disaster relief in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces, have now been decided to be used in part for disaster relief in Shaanxi. However, the exact amount has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Date of Assuming Office Shao is scheduled to take the overnight train to Nanjing tonight and go west to Shaanxi and Gansu on the 8th with Zhu Shaoliang, the Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, to assume their respective offices. Zhu took the overnight train to Nanjing last night to wait for Shao to travel together. Regarding the personnel for the various departments of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, Shao said that except for the directors of the Civil Affairs Department and the Finance Department, the rest will remain the same. There will be no changes. As for the candidates for the directors of the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, they should be approved and announced by the Executive Yuan meeting next Tuesday.</p>
<h3 id="e121">He Bingxian Discusses the International Trade Bureau <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>He Bingxian, Director of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, took a leave of absence last month due to illness and was hospitalized for treatment. He has now fully recovered and returned to the bureau to handle affairs. According to Director He, the special bureau for trade with Russia has been thoroughly planned, but a decision can only be made after Minister of Finance Song Ziwen returns from Europe. Therefore, it is currently on hold. Our country's export trade to the Philippines has always been very developed. The Philippine industrial delegation came to China for sightseeing and to meet with various sectors of society, which will further promote the future of trade between the two countries. However, the nature of the delegation focuses on emotion, so although there have been talks, there have been no specific decisions.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Japanese Goods Dumped, China's Rubber Industry in Danger <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Over Ten Factories Forced to Close</p>
<p>Workers Petition the Social Affairs Bureau for Relief</p>
<p>China's rubber industry has been developing since 1917, with new factories springing up one after another. However, in recent years, due to the impact of the current situation, it has only been able to maintain expenses. Recently, with the brisk sales of Japanese goods and the accumulation of inventory, it has become difficult for factories to maintain operations. Therefore, there has been a wave of closures, layoffs, and dismissals. According to Wan Yunfang of the Rubber Industry Association, there are 37 members of the association in the city, and four non-members. All of them are experiencing tight cash flow, inventory accumulation, and sluggish sales, resulting in one-third of them announcing closures. Based on the current situation, if sales do not improve, the rubber industry is likely to go bankrupt. The reason for this is that the industry's goods have traditionally been sold to the Northeast. Now, the Northeast market has been seized by Japan, and the products of local factories can only be sold in the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River. Because there are too many products, supply exceeds demand, making it impossible to maintain operations. The situation of each factory is recorded below:</p>
<p>Huatong Rubber Factory, Huatong Feihong Branch Road, has a total of 400 male and female workers. It has been open for almost four years. In the past, business was good. This year, due to the impact of the current situation, inventory cannot be sold. The factory shortened working hours from April 1st to avoid losses. On May 27th, it announced its closure. When workers inquired about the reopening date, the factory did not give a date, causing panic among all the workers. On May 31st, they negotiated with the factory but were rejected. Unable to do anything else, 40 representatives, including Xie Fulong, Chen Asan, Sun Chengkun, Yang Zhaonian, Qiu Genghui, Wu Youfu, and Zhu Jinbao, submitted a written petition to the Social Affairs Bureau at 9:00 AM yesterday, requesting a prompt resolution. Wu Xianqing, the director of the Mediation Section, received them and promised to send someone to investigate immediately. At 10:30 AM, Zhu Guilin from the Third Section of the Social Affairs Bureau went to investigate the truth.</p>
<p>Dade Rubber Factory, Gaolang Bridge, has a total of 50 male workers and 200 female workers. It announced its closure the day before yesterday (the 1st). All the workers immediately submitted a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting relief. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Zhu Guilin, a staff member from the Third Section, to mediate at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. A solution has been found.</p>
<p>Huashun Rubber Factory, Kangnaotuo Road, has a total of over 100 male and female workers. It announced its closure on April 9th due to various reasons. Although the Party and government agencies have mediated several times in the past two months, no solution has been reached due to differing opinions on both sides.</p>
<p>Minghua Rubber Factory, Dapuqiao, has a total of over 60 male and female workers. It announced its closure last year due to the impact of the war. As of now, it has not reopened due to tight cash flow.</p>
<p>Dayong Rubber Factory, Taopeng Road, has a total of over 400 male and female workers. It suspended all work from May 25th due to sluggish sales. No solution has been reached for a week.</p>
<p>Great China Welfare Rubber Factory, Xingjiazhai Road, has a total of over 300 workers. In February of this year, a strike dispute arose due to the dismissal of workers. The Social Affairs Bureau mediated several times, but no agreement was reached due to conflicting opinions. It has been three months, and no solution has been reached. It is reported that the factory and the workers are currently negotiating.</p>
<p>Dahua Rubber Factory, Meizhou Road, employs over 100 male and female workers. It announced its closure last year due to the accumulation of inventory and inability to sell it. It has been closed for half a year, and there is no reopening date.</p>
<p>Yiyuan Rubber Factory, North Chengdu Road, caused a strike dispute in March due to the unwarranted dismissal of workers. After mediation by the Party and government agencies, a temporary solution was reached. The dismissed workers, Cai Richu, Yang Yan, and Li Rong, will not return to work for the time being. Now, the Social Affairs Bureau has decided that workers Cai Richu and Yang Yan will be allowed to return to work, but the factory has refused. Unable to do anything else, workers Li Rong and Cai Richu submitted a written petition to the Social Affairs Bureau at 10:00 AM yesterday. Wang Xianqing, a staff member from the Third Section, received them and promised to send someone to mediate.</p>
<p>Dazhong Rubber Factory, New Jia坡 Road, the factory announced its closure on the 13th of last month. After mediation by the Party and government agencies, it was decided that the factory was unable to operate. The factory agreed to provide food, and the workers received 100 yuan at the end of last month to barely maintain themselves. Yesterday, they ran out of food and requested assistance from the Party and government agencies. The Social Affairs Bureau sent Tan Peiyan, a staff member from the Third Section, along with workers Shen Rongquan and Xu Yunjia to accompany them. The factory provided 100 yuan for food expenses.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Second Phase of Continued Work Reduction Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>However, Shenxin, Tongyi, etc., Have All Canceled the Reduction</p>
<p>Fear of Cotton Shortage, Various Factories Seek Remedy</p>
<p>After the Hengfeng and other Chinese cotton mills continued to reduce work, yesterday was the second day of the reduced work period. However, the factories under Shenxin and others continued to work as usual. Various manufacturers are trying to find remedies. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e125">Continued Work Reduction <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday was the second phase of continued work reduction after the expiration of the first reduction period. In this city, a total of 28 factories, with 1,066,920 spindles, 9,060 thread spindles, and 7,864 looms, stopped working or continued to reduce work. There were 17 factories including Hengfeng. Factories that canceled the work reduction included 8 factories including Shenxin and Tongyi. The Jingwei and Chongxin factories have never reduced work. The workers in the closed factories live scattered in their homes, maintaining good order. They continued to stop working as usual today and will resume work tomorrow morning.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Fear of Cotton Shortage <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The total amount of raw materials for textiles in this city, including domestic cotton, American cotton, and Indian cotton, is less than 400,000 dan. According to the needs of the Chinese and foreign cotton mills in the city, this is not enough to maintain operations for even one month. After the panic occurred before the new cotton was available, the Municipal Government and others discussed ways to rescue the Chinese cotton mills the day before yesterday, deciding to telegraph Minister Song in the United States for help. As for the Shanghai cotton mills, they have been trying to transport the cotton stored in the interior and producing areas to Shanghai to make up for the shortage and avoid shutdowns due to a lack of raw materials.

<p>Discussed the Difficult Recovery of the Tianjin Naval Hospital</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, Minister of the Navy Chen Shaokuan came to Shanghai yesterday for matters related to the Jiangnan Shipyard. When asked by reporters about the Lushan Conference and Chen's personal opinions, Chen said that the details had been announced in Nanjing by President Wang Jingwei's speech and telegram, and Mr. Xiong Bin had already reported on the proceedings in the newspapers, so he had no further comments. Regarding the sale of the Tianjin Naval Hospital to the French, the matter is still being negotiated by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It seems that the road foundation to be delivered may not be recovered, and the French attitude is tough, with the demolition of buildings continuing. Therefore, some compensation may be paid for the buildings in the future. However, the responsibility lies entirely with Zhang (Xueliang) for the unauthorized sale, so Zhang bears full responsibility. Commander Chen Xunyong has led the Chuyou and other eight ships to the Minzhe sea area to conduct naval exercises, and they have arrived at their destination and started the exercises. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek returned to Nanchang the day before yesterday on the Haijun's Jiangkun warship, not by train.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Japanese Conspiracy to Seize Our Indigo Industry <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Indigo Factories Close Down, Indigo Workers Lose Jobs</p>
<p>Indigo blue is the only essential element for dyes in our country. Japan has never manufactured indigo blue, but in recent years has been thinking of ways to seize our indigo industry. They even came up with a bizarre idea to use the residual sulfur black from their manufacture of explosives and dump it in China. In general unscrupulous merchants, are being fooled and are also acting insane, accepting and distributing it everywhere on their behalf. The application procedures for sulphur black and indigo blue are different. As soon as a dye shop adopts sulphur black, all the internal equipment must be completely changed. As a result, no fewer than thousands of domestic indigo dye factories have closed at the same time, and tens of thousands of dye workers have lost their jobs. Farmers who used to plant indigo as a profession have also stopped. The statistics are as follows and are specially disclosed to warn the commercial and industrial circles in our country. If we do not rise up and pursue the matter, our indigo industry will be completely seized by the Japanese.</p>

<p>Impose Anti-Dumping Duties</p>
<h3 id="e129">Review of the Nature of Dumped Goods <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Establishment of a Committee to Review Dumped Goods</p>
<p>The US Will Also Levy Anti-Dumping Duties on Japanese Dumping</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Japanese goods are being dumped in our country, attempting to counteract the impact of our boycott movement and significantly affecting the future of our domestic industries. The Ministries of Finance and Industry jointly proposed levying anti-dumping duties last month to protect the domestic goods market. A review committee has already been established. Simultaneously, the United Kingdom is also preparing for these tariff regulations due to the impact of Japanese dumping. Details are noted as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e130">Review Committee <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, led by the Director-General of Customs, Shen Shuyu, together with the three directors of the Ministry of Industry's Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture departments, have organized a committee to review dumped goods. It has been established in the capital, and for convenience, an office has also been set up in this city, which has already started operating. The committee will begin by conducting reviews, strictly examining all imported goods to determine whether they are being dumped. Then, they will establish categories of dumped goods and implement taxes.</p>

<p>British colonies and their commercially monopolized markets, such as India, Burma, Persia, and Egypt, have recently also suffered from the harm of Japanese goods dumping, significantly impacting the British goods market. Therefore, the United Kingdom is adopting the same policy as our country, preparing to levy anti-dumping duties. Our authorities have already consulted with the UK regarding implementation methods to learn from their experience.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Reasons for Dumping <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, someone familiar with the current state of international economics stated that dumping policies are an inevitable result of overproduction. While levying anti-dumping duties is a remedial measure, the fundamental issue still lies in the recovery of global prosperity. Some manufacturers abroad, in light of the fact that ceasing or reducing production does not save on expenses but rather leads to unemployment for workers, implement dumping of light industrial products to safeguard the livelihoods of workers. Recently, on the market, vendors can be seen everywhere selling lightweight rubber balls shaped like balloons for only a few small coins. These goods are a type of dumped product, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Record of the Standing Committee Meeting of the Industrial and Commercial Management Association <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Held for the 40th Time</p>
<p>Chen Baocheng's Speech</p>
<p>Yesterday, the China Industrial and Commercial Management Association convened its 40th standing committee meeting at the Lianhua General Association at No. 4 Beijing Road, gathering various industrial and commercial members. Representatives Wu Shizhao, Fang Yexian, Cheng Shouchong, Zeng Yunxiang, Zheng Yuanxing, Shao Zenghua, Ma Yanhua, and others, over 20 people in total, attended. In addition to reporting and discussing association affairs, to enable all members to understand the implementation of factory inspections, they specially invited Chen Baocheng of the International Labour Office to give a speech on "The Factory Law Implementation Problem in Concessions and Foreign Factories." Mr. Chen had done much research on this issue and spoke in great detail. A summary of his main points is as follows: Mr. Chen stated that the issue of factory inspection was a preliminary task after the National Government promulgated the Factory Law. At that time, the International Labour Office also participated in discussions, but due to the significance and complexity of the issue, although the results were close at the time, they were delayed for several years due to interruption and have not been implemented yet. Recently, the Municipal Council suddenly amended Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations in the Westerners' Annual Meeting, with the aim of seizing our country's factory inspection rights. However, it still requires discussion by the Diplomatic Corps. If it is passed by the Diplomatic Corps in the future, the negotiations on factory inspection in the concessions will not have good results, so everyone should not neglect it. However, one must also not disregard the Factory Law because of factory inspections. The most important thing is to actively implement the provisions of the Factory Law to the best of one's ability to achieve excellent results, which can also be used as a basis for rejecting inspections in future negotiations. In short, we should recognize the purpose of the Factory Law and seek ways to implement it, so that the responsibilities of factories can be reduced, equal treatment for labor and management can be achieved, and considerable effectiveness can be obtained, which is also the only way to enhance government negotiations. Furthermore, to actively seek the improvement of factory management, the association recently dispatched personnel to inspect various major factories, aiming to achieve good factory management and obtain considerable results.</p>

<p>Shanghai Road Citizen Association Notifies Members</p>
<h3 id="e140">Voluntarily Sealing Inferior Goods <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Road Businessmen's Association and the 17th District Citizen Association in this city are urging members to voluntarily seal up inferior goods to eliminate them. The notification is recorded as follows: Notification is about the matter. This association's Citizen Association recently organized a Council to Promote Domestic Goods, and its branch is also representing attend. This Council is based on the principle of promoting domestic goods and on the basis of inspecting inferior goods as part of its work. The discussion is rational and relevant to today's society and on the facts is quite beneficial to businesses and people. This association's members are all patriots and would never sell inferior goods. However, since the the goods accumulated in the past have not been eliminated, this district branch, for the sake of protecting its fellow members, hereby issues a formal notification that those with inferior goods in stock should seal them up immediately to show their sincerity. If there are no inferior goods in stock, they are welcome to be inspected as much as possible. Furthermore, this inspection will be conducted in a completely friendly manner.

<p>The Southern Goods Industry's Committee for the Inspection of Enemy Goods is actively dispatching personnel in separate directions to register and thoroughly investigate the number of enemy goods in stock. Currently, the registration of more than 400 southern goods stores in this city will be completed within days.

The committee was very angry upon receiving the report. Yesterday afternoon, Lü Jiafu, the manager of Zikang and Tianping, happened to be at the southern goods market due to business. The committee's members went to advise him to accept registration. Lü initially refused, but after unanimous condemnation from various colleagues, he agreed to report the number of enemy goods in stock to the committee within thirteen days. Furthermore, according to a confidential report, a certain southern goods store in Nanyang secretly imported a large batch of enemy goods. The committee has dispatched personnel to thoroughly investigate and has scheduled a meeting to discuss punishment measures.</p>

<p>The Fisheries Improvement Committee of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang area, due to the collection of fisheries construction fees, at the beginning, all fisheries were able to appreciate the government's intention to construct fisheries, and all were happy to comply, such as various industries in Shanghai having already complied. Subsequently, a few fishmonger saboteurs, with other effects, intentionally destroyed it and incited and intimidated, using all means, and borrowed hotels outside as meeting places, instigating resistance, so that fishmongers with weaker intentions were occasionally used by them. Recently, the collection has been very difficult. The committee believes that the plot of the agitators is to destroy the entire plan of fisheries construction, and it is not enough to discuss countermeasures to show the severity. To seek the success of the fee collection, it has flown a telegram to all members to call an emergency meeting of all members to discuss countermeasures and seek the effectiveness of the collection.</p>

<p>The Widowed Daughter-in-Law Hu Changjuan Cannot Bear Jiang's Abuse</p>
<p>Demanding Separate Residence and Child Support</p>
<p>Jiang Claims He Gives His Daughter-in-Law 18 Yuan per Month, Indicating No Abuse</p>
<p>Jiang Changgui, a native of this county, is the brother-in-law of Gu Weijun, a famous figure in our country's diplomacy, and is currently the chief of the disbursement section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou and Beijing roads. His son, Renqi, married Hu Juan from Anhui in 1926 and had one son and two daughters. The son's name is Jiayu, who is now eight years old, and the two daughters have both died young. Renqi worked at the Singer Company and died of illness in early May 1930. Jiang Hu Changjuan recently hired lawyers Lu Qi and Chen Ying to sue Jiang Changgui in the civil division of the First Special Court, demanding separate residence and the payment of child support of 30,000 yuan. The reason is that Jiang's wife, Gu,</p>

<p>Constantly Giving Her Dirty Looks, Wilful Trampling, Abusing the Plaintiff from Time to Time, Not Treating the Grandson's Illness, and Driving the Daughter-in-Law Out of the House, Causing the Plaintiff to Live in Poverty Every Day, Borrowing Money to Make Ends Meet, and Being Utterly Wretched. After recounting various hardships, the Special Court summoned the defendant once. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Qiao Wanxuan opened the court to summon the defendant, Jiang Changgui, who also arrived in court with lawyers Liu Shichao and Wang Peiyuan. Judge Qiao first advised the two parties, saying that it is inevitable to have disagreements within a family that lead to litigation, but once the relationship is broken, it cannot be restored. Therefore, reconciliation is the best solution in this case. Both parties should calmly discuss a proper solution to make peace, and so on.</p>
<p>However, Jiang Hu Changjuan said that since her parents-in-law treated her abusively, even the servants made things difficult for her, with cold words and mockery in every bite and sip. She stated that she could not accept reconciliation. The court then ordered the trial to proceed and first asked Jiang Changgui if the points alleged by the plaintiff were true and if he had any defense against the allegations. He replied that separate residence was not possible.</p>

<p>He stated that he was unable to pay the 30,000 yuan demanded, and that the accusations of abuse were not true. He had always cared for his children and grandchildren. However, the plaintiff did not show respect to her parents-in-law and often had to go out for more than 20 days each month. He now requested a court order for them to live together because there was no abuse and he had always</p>

<p>And hired a maid to serve her, so that the plaintiff did not have to do anything at home, and so on, for a total of eight points. Since the defendant denied the allegations, the court ordered the plaintiff to provide evidence. Lawyer Chen then presented letters from Renqi to the Shenghuo Daily and the two lawyers, in which he stated that his son Jiayu was being mistreated at home. She also presented</p>
<h3 id="e150">Renji Charity Hall Prescriptions <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>A bundle to prove that the defendant did not seek medical treatment when the plaintiff was ill, so she had to seek treatment at the Charity Hall. She also had the testimony of the maid Shen Abaobao. Jiang Changgui denied that the three letters presented by the plaintiff's lawyer were written by his son and also presented medical prescriptions to prove that he had sought medical treatment when the plaintiff and his grandchildren were ill. He also stated that he had spent more than 400 yuan on medical expenses when Sun Jiayu was ill. He also claimed that he had given Renqi 1,200 yuan in the two years that he had moved out, including 200 yuan that was sent to the Singer Company by his colleague Wang Guisheng, who could be summoned to testify. The court stated that further testimony was needed, so it ordered a rescheduled hearing on the 12th of this month and advised the two parties to continue reconciliation to avoid litigation and hoped that they would not be motivated by money so that the proceedings could proceed smoothly.</p>

<p>Wrapping Drugs in Newspapers</p>
<p>Sent from Chongqing to Shanghai by Mail</p>
<p>Wu Yulin, a Sichuan native, 48 years old, residing at No. 6, Gengyu Lane, No. 489 Rue Paul Beau, New Peace Apartments, Room 3, was selling morphine with Ji Xuanquan at No. 65 Quanxue Street, Chongqing, Sichuan, using more than ten names, including Wu Yongzhi, Wang Linsheng, Lin Xiasheng, Wu Yulin, Lin Xiasheng, Wu Yulin, Kong Xiang. The method was clever, and outsiders could not easily see through it. The secret was that Ji in Sichuan wrapped the drugs in newspapers and mailed them to Shanghai, addressed to Wu, or to Chen Xinfang and Li Quanan at the Shufeng Yin'er Company near the Daiteng Bridge on Avenue Edward VII and the Huiji Xing Customs Brokerage in Mantingfang, or to the Dahua Apartments on Rue Paul Beau, for Wu to receive and sell. The proceeds were sent to Sichuan. From the 8th to the 18th of last month, as many as 32 items (each item being a roll of newspaper) had been mailed to Shanghai, and Wu had made a considerable profit by selling them. This time, the Postal Bureau on Kai'er Road, Ba Xianqiao, received six rolls of newspapers from Ji Xuanquan in Chongqing, Sichuan, addressed to Wu, weighing 1,892 grams. Suspicious, they inspected them and discovered that the rolls were filled with drugs. They reported it to the police, and detectives Xu Desheng, Bao Tan Liu Jinrong, and Shen Jinshi rushed to New Peace Apartments at 4:00 PM the day before yesterday and arrested Wu, as well as Chen Xinfang and Li Quanan, who were involved. They also confiscated a bill of the 32 rolls of newspapers previously received at Wu's residence and took them to the police station for temporary detention. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Criminal Division 1 of the Second Special District Court. Judge Xiong interrogated them. Police lawyer Gu Shouxi stated the case, prosecuted under Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, and requested a postponement for further investigation. He then presented the evidence. Detective Liu Jinrong reported the progress of the case and the arrest of the defendants. The defendants denied and quibbled. The court ordered a rescheduled hearing in ten days, and the defendants were remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Infatuated with a Prostitute, He Drives a Car to the Dance Hall</p>
<p>How Will Yang Yuqin Face His Wife?</p>
<p>Yang Yuqin, a cosmetics salesman who also works at Minli Middle School, is thirty-four years old. Ten years ago, he married a Miss Ding through a matchmaker. His wife is now thirty-three years old. The couple originally lived together at No. 67 Race Course Road and were initially very harmonious. Since last year, however, they suddenly developed animosity towards each other, turning affection into coldness. Yang refused to acknowledge Miss Ding as his wife, claiming that their union was never formal and that they might as well go their separate ways. Miss Ding, on the other hand, claimed that Yang, infatuated with Yang Lanchun from Qunyufang, intended to abandon his wife. They frequently quarreled and sometimes even resorted to violence. Last year alone, they were involved in lawsuits twice, both initiated by Miss Ding, first accusing him of abuse and insult, which was resolved through court mediation. Then, she sued him for neglecting to provide alimony, which was also mediated by the judge, who ordered the defendant, Yang Yuqin, to pay 60 yuan per month for living expenses and ordered the plaintiff, Miss Ding, to rent a separate residence, hoping that after a considerable period, their feelings would reconcile and they could reunite. However, Yang Yuqin had other intentions and disregarded the court mediation record as a mere formality, never paying the alimony as ordered, or only paying a small amount. Last month, Miss Ding petitioned the First Special District Court again, requesting immediate enforcement. At this time, Yang Yuqin filed a lawsuit against Miss Ding to terminate their relationship, because Yang denied that Miss Ding was his wife, he did not call it a divorce, but a termination of relationship. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang from the Civil Court of the court held a hearing. Yang Yuqin testified that he and Miss Ding were indeed only living together. After the court mediation last year, the defendant did not comply with the order to live separately and only recently moved out. Because he runs a cosmetics business, he needs to socialize. Occasionally, he goes to dance halls to dance with female friends, and she makes trouble on this pretext. He is truly suffering and cannot afford to pay alimony. He requests a clean break. Then, Miss Ding testified that she married him as his wife, with a marriage certificate and a matchmaker as proof, twelve years ago. He once said that the marriage certificate was forged by her, which is ridiculous. Now he wants to divorce her because he is having an affair with Yang Lanchun, so that he can live with his mistress. If he says he has no money, then how can he afford to drive a car, visit his mistress, and go to dance halls? She asked the court not to believe his lies. She would not consider divorce, nor would she consider reducing the amount of alimony. However, since the mediation, he has not paid a single month. She filed a petition for enforcement because she had no way to survive. She also presented a red marriage certificate as evidence. Judge Yang, after reviewing the evidence, stated that because the defendant disputed the issue of identity, further investigation was necessary. Therefore, he adjourned the hearing for a later date.</p>

<p>Bloodstains on a Woman's Throat</p>
<p>A Blood-Stained Razor Nearby</p>
<p>The Man Claims the Woman Committed Suicide</p>
<p>Around 5 PM the day before yesterday, a man and a woman suddenly arrived at the Datong Hotel in the Wing On Company on Nanjing Road, Meihua Street, and asked to stay. The cashier led them to room 517 on the fifth floor. The man identified himself as Hong Dajun, a 21-year-old from Guangdong. The woman was named Qiu Zengshi, age 20, also from Guangdong. At the time, Hong paid the room fee. The two sat in the room for a while and then went out together, returning around 8 PM that evening and immediately closing the door to sleep. Around 6 AM yesterday morning, the night shift tea server on the floor suddenly heard a commotion from the room, mixed with a woman's cries for help. He urgently opened the door from the outside to investigate and saw bloodstains all over the woman's throat, with a blood-stained razor nearby. Knowing something was wrong, he quickly reported to the cashier, who reported to the Lao Zha police station. The police dispatched detectives to the scene, first sending the woman to Renji Hospital and then taking Hong Dajun to the police station. Under interrogation by the police chief, Hong claimed that Qiu Zengshi's throat wound was self-inflicted and denied any involvement in the crime. He was evasive in his other statements. The police chief ordered him to be detained temporarily pending further investigation. Qiu Zengshi's injuries are reportedly not life-threatening. The truth of the case is quite intriguing, and according to the reporter's observation, it may have been caused by jealousy.</p>

<p>The "Da Mei Evening News" reported that a Western salesman from the Old Jinlong Foreign Firm, named Pei'er, suffered a fatal injury at 4 PM on Wednesday and collapsed on the side of Guangdong Road. Two Western passers-by sent him to a nearby doctor for emergency treatment and then transferred him to the hospital. He died on Thursday morning. When an American named Hagerlaifu heard that Pei'er had died in the hospital yesterday (the 2nd), he went to the American prosecutor, Sa Laide, to surrender. The circumstances of the fight were recorded and he was detained by the American authorities. Today (the 3rd), it was heard that Ha had given a detailed account of the fight with Pei'er. However, the American prosecutor has not yet charged Ha and is not expected to make a decision on what charges to file until after the inquiry into the circumstances of Pei'er's death on the 9th of this month. Regarding the cause of the dispute between the two, Ha claimed that it arose because a batch of loans was sold to a customer known to Pei'er. Pei'er was punched in the jaw and fell to the sidewalk. It has not yet been announced whether the internal bleeding at the back of the head, discovered during the autopsy, was caused by the punch or by hitting the ground. Ha used to serve in the American Marine Corps. He was transferred to China and retired from the army in Shanghai a year and a half ago and has been working as an automobile salesman.</p>

<p>Municipal Government in Consultation with the China Merchants Public Bus Company</p>
<p>The municipal government is actively promoting the construction of the central district of the city. The main roads have been completed one after another, and the new municipal government building can be completed within the year. The prosperity of the central district will soon arrive. However, the prosperity of the city is closely related to transportation. Therefore, the municipal government has contacted various transportation agencies to establish transportation routes. It is heard that the Zhabei China Merchants Public Bus Company also has plans to expand. Zhabei is very close to the central district, and the existing routes only need to be extended. Therefore, the company has prepared a plan to extend the routes and has contacted the municipal government several times. According to the company's existing routes, the western starting point has already been established and the northern terminus has reached Jiangwan Town. The company now plans to add three more routes, with the central district as the transportation hub. The first route would start from North Sichuan Road, pass through Yokohama Road, Water and Electricity Road, and Jungong Road, ending at Shanghai University. The second route would start from De恩威 Road, pass through other roads and Sanmin Road, ending at the new municipal government building. The third route would start from the Fuzhi Hotel in Baotaiwan, pass through Jungong Road, other roads, World Road, and end at the new municipal government building. The company is currently in consultation with the municipal government on this plan, which is expected to be resolved in the near future.</p>

<p>An Apprentice Dies...A Worker is Injured</p>
<p>Yaohua Dyeing and Weaving Factory, located at No. 105 Caishi Road in the French Concession, prints and dyes various kinds of silk fabrics. It is a joint-stock company managed by Li Zhonghua from Haimen. There are over a hundred workers and apprentices. Yesterday, at 1 PM after lunch, a worker named Xie Jifang, 17 years old, from Haimen, was smoking a cigarette upstairs during his break. A fellow apprentice named Chen Pengnian, 20 years old, went up to joke with Xie and tried to stop him from smoking, snatching the cigarette and throwing it on the floor. Xie smiled and lightly slapped Chen's face. As he bent down to pick up the cigarette butt, Chen grabbed a rope and tried to tie Xie's hands to a pillar. The two began to playfully wrestle. Unexpectedly, as they wrestled near the staircase, they both lost their footing and fell down the stairs. Xie was in front and fell to the ground first, injuring both arms. Chen fell to the ground behind him, bleeding from his mouth and nose. He lost consciousness immediately due to a head injury. The rope he was holding was still in his hand. When the factory staff saw what had happened, they reported it to the Xiahfei police station, who sent detectives to investigate. They sent Chen to Renji Hospital for treatment, and took Xie to the police station. Under questioning by the police chief, Xie said that his arms were sore and he asked the police to send him to Renji Hospital. After a doctor bandaged his wounds, the police brought him back to the police station. Chen's brain injury was too severe and he died after being admitted to the hospital for about an hour. The hospital notified the police station, who sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch for autopsy, pending investigation by the court. The police chief ordered Xie to be detained pending further investigation.</p>

<p>The ancient bell of North Bridge in the new Shanghai County is a famous historical site in Shanghai. In the past, due to years of disrepair, it had already shown signs of collapse. The Shanghai County Chief, Mr. Yan Shenyu, in order to preserve the historical site, initiated a fundraising campaign for its renovation. All donations are kept by the Shanghai Bank on behalf of the project. The estimated cost of the repair is almost matched by the donations. Therefore, the current County Chief Cao ordered the technical director (former Director of the Construction Bureau) Mr. Sun Shengzeng to draft designs, invite contractors to bid, and start the reconstruction.</p>
<h3 id="e161">New Title List of the Song Dynasty Tripitaka <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai recently reproduced Song dynasty Tripitaka Sutras are managed by the Shadow Printing Song Edition Tripitaka Association at No. 714 Weihaiwei Road. The original was published in the fourth year of the Shaoding era of Emperor Lizong of the Song Dynasty (1231 CE) by the Yan Sheng Yuan in Pingjiang Prefecture, Qisha, over 702 years ago. At that time, a Tripitaka Sutra Bureau was specially established with a very well organised structure, with positions such as chief officer, text comparator, proofreader, bureau chief, and director, all appointed by famous monks and nuns. The entire Sutra consists of 6,310 volumes. Its characters are ancient and elegant, and the carving is exquisite, making it a great contribution to Buddhist art. The careful collation, thorough annotations, comprehensive prefaces, and numerous records all make it far superior to other Sutras in terms of benefiting research and promoting culture. Currently, only one copy is preserved in the Wolong Temple in Shaanxi, making it a unique copy in the world. The Association sent personnel to compile and photograph the Sutra. Since a small number of volumes were corroded and blurred, they were supplemented with good copies sought from Beijing, Sichuan, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places (it is said that the supplemented copies are from the Sixi Edition, Puning Edition, Jingding Lu Daoyuan Edition, and Yanyou Yihmishi Edition). Only over 200 volumes.) The style of reproduction follows the original edition in every way, the number of lines and characters are the same, without any cutting. It is also very convenient for collecting, reciting and reading. The criticisms of this Sutra from all parties agree that its volumes are magnificent, its spirit is full, and there has never been a shadow of a Song edition book like this. Each pre-ordered copy is sold for only 525 yuan because the initiators wish for its circulation and do not consider it for commercial purposes at all. Before pre-orders are released, 60 to 70 copies have already been sold. Since advertisements were published in various newspapers, libraries, Buddhist temples, academic groups across the country, and universities in Europe, America, and Japan have sent letters and telegrams requesting samples. Due to economic constraints, the Association only printed 500 copies, which will not be enough to distribute. Furthermore, due to various reasons, the films (commonly known as wet films) cannot be re-printed in the future. Therefore, if you order a little later, you may regret not having it. The Association has investigated that the names of domestic customers who have paid the deposit up to May are listed as follows. Western and Eastern names have not been included: Two Dharma masters, Mo Chen Zhi Heng, one copy, Song Dezhong one copy, Zhou Shouliang one copy, Yang Zhonghu one copy, Penang Buddhist College one copy, Quantang Zhaoqing Temple one copy, Dharma master Xing Ci three copies, Di Chuqing seven copies, Kuai Ruomu one copy, Tian Yunshan one copy, Yuan Shaoming one copy, Yang Yuncun one copy, Ni Wenqing one copy, Ms. Li Xuying one copy, Dongfang Tuchun Hall one copy, Rong Desheng one copy, Ninja Grass Grove one copy, Baisha Brahma Temple one copy, Fentuoli Room one copy, Fayun Temple one copy, Li Qiqing one copy, Liu Huizhi one copy, Ji Mingyou one copy, Wu Haiuo one copy, Zhenjiang Library one copy, Nantong Library one copy, Kaifu Temple one copy, French Seminary one copy, Tang Shoupeng one copy, Shangfang Temple one copy, Zhou Zhian two copies, Lady Ho Tung two copies, Yongliwei Firm one copy, Hu Shaoqing one copy, Tsinghua University Library one copy, Ding Ziying one copy, Yao Wenfu one copy, Lingnan University Library one copy, Department of Affairs Printing Press one copy, Yu Kailing one copy, Ma Shaotang one copy, Dayu Buddhist Association one copy, Jueyuan Fa Bao two copies, Dharma master Yin Guang one copy, Huang Yi Qiu one copy, Chen Jingtao four copies, Guanghua University Library one copy, Zhao Yunchang one copy, Yunnan Provincial Government one copy, Qian Ziquan one copy.</p>

<h3 id="e164">Case of Yueh Constable Assaulting a Hawker <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Reply from the French Consul-General to the Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association Explaining the Incident</p>
<p>Hawker Zhang Yu'gao was assaulted by Constable No. 198 on Caishi Street on the 27th of last month while setting up a stall. The Ningbo Fellow-Villagers Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the French Concession police authorities to inquire about the incident. The previous report has already mentioned this. It is now known that Police Commissioner Faber sent a letter to the Association yesterday, stating that after an investigation by the Melun Police Station, according to Zhang Yu'gao's statement to the police, he was kicked in the left eyebrow by Constable No. 198. The constable was on duty at the intersection of Dongxinqiao Street and Caishi Street. After questioning, the child stated that he was selling food without a license (his mother did have a license at No. 164) in front of No. 165 Caishi Street. After being driven away, he was seen returning to the original place, so the constable intended to arrest him. When he bent over to pack up the vegetables, intending to flee, the constable tried to step on the vegetable basket, but used a little too much force, causing the basket to tip over and injure his eye. The child had a scratch on his lower eyelid, so it is almost certain that the basket touched his eye. He was immediately sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, and was discharged after being bandaged. The hospital's diagnosis stated "not serious" and "ten days of treatment". According to the report of the detective No. 155 sent to investigate, no one at the scene witnessed the constable mistreating Zhang Yu'gao. (Omission). It is clear that the injury was accidental. The relevant situation is hereby replied for your information.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Two Wronged Souls Under the Wheels <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>On the afternoon of June 1st, the Shanghai Aviation Association held the naming ceremony for Shanghai Aircraft No. 1, which attracted citizens to visit Jiangwan Road enthusiastically. Although they wanted to cross the road, it was not easy. Near Tiyuhui Road and Chizhi University, blacksmith Zhu A-quan and his apprentice, carrying iron bars on their shoulders, waited for a long time in a corner. They took the opportunity to run across. However, the apprentice was even more anxious and stepped forward, running straight to the center of the road. Zhu A-quan saw vehicles speeding in both directions and was extremely dangerous, so he chased after the apprentice to pull him back. However, the city was merciless, and he was knocked to the ground. The iron bars on his shoulders were even more painful. He was hit in the head, and his soul flew away. He was too seriously injured and died shortly after. The apprentice only suffered injuries to his forehead and ears. It was discovered that the car that caused the accident, when it hit Zhu A-quan, tried to brake and turned the steering wheel to avoid, and it also damaged a certain gentleman's car from the court. Also, around 5:00 PM on the afternoon of June 2nd, near Tanzi Lake Yanzhan Station on Jiao通 Road, another public bus No. 4927 was driving straight from Zhenru to the North Station. When it reached this location, a certain Zhu was standing on the north side of the road, calling out to his five-year-old child, Zhu Lan-shu, who was playing on the south side. The child, hearing Zhu's call (the child's mother), responded quickly and ran forward. The driver of the bus, seeing that an accident was about to happen, immediately braked. The front wheels had avoided the child, but the child, in a state of panic, came into contact with the rear wheels of the car. After a short while, he bled excessively and was sent to the hospital for treatment. Ultimately, he could not be saved. Thinking about transportation as a tool of convenience, it is becoming more and more prosperous. If one accidentally fails to avoid an accident, it is very regrettable to die an unnatural death. It is said that the family of Zhu A-quan, who was killed in the accident, requested compensation from the car owner. The car owner saw that the deceased's family was poor and did not completely refuse a reasonable request. If they could negotiate, there would be a possibility of reaching an agreement. It is unknown how the matter will be settled since the family suddenly changed their attitude and claimed that they would transfer the case to the court for judgment.</p>

<p>Zhang Quanrong, a white lead worker from Wuxi, was employed at the residence of Mr. Zhu at a certain number on Changsha Road, west of Zhang's Garden in the Public Concession. He was thirty-eight years old. Yesterday at around 5:45 PM, two airplanes were heard rumbling in the sky, approaching from afar. Zhang's curiosity was aroused, and he rushed to the drying platform, looking up into the sky. The handrail of the drying platform, due to years of disrepair, was severely corroded and snapped in two. As a result, Zhang lost his footing and fell. His skull was fractured, and he died immediately. After someone reported to the police station, the Xinzha Fire Brigade was notified, and an ambulance was dispatched to the scene. The body was transported to Renji Hospital and then to the autopsy center for examination.</p>

<p>Representatives Appointed from Silk Weaving and Silk Brocade Industries</p>
<p>The domestic trade of national silk brocade has been seized by Japanese goods. In recent years, sales have plummeted, to less than two or three out of ten. In addition, the price of silk in the domestic market has also been falling daily, making it difficult to maintain costs and resulting in excessive write-downs. The silk industry is facing bankruptcy and is in a precarious situation. Previously, the Electric Silk Weaving Factory Association and the Silk Brocade Industry Association of this city, recognizing the situation, decided to petition the government for the return of the import tax on rayon. They convened a meeting the day before yesterday and appointed representatives to go to Beijing to petition. The appointed petitioners from the associations include Wang Shiqiang, Gao Shiheng, Qian Boxi, Cai Xintao, and Huang Jiwen from the Electric Silk Weaving Factory Association, and Pan Runsheng and Zhang Hongsun from the Silk Brocade Industry Association. At the same time, they sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to appoint a representative to lead the two industries and assist in the petition. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied that the matter had been submitted to the 37th Standing Committee meeting for deliberation, and Standing Committee member Wang Yansong was appointed as the representative. He will travel to Beijing with the group to conduct the petition. It is said that the departure date of the petition group is scheduled for the night train to Beijing on the 5th of this month.</p>

<p>Coming to Shanghai Soon to Perform</p>
<p>The world-renowned German Karl Hagenbeck Circus is currently performing in Japan. It is expected that the entire troupe will arrive in Shanghai in early September and will perform amazing stunts on the vacant lot of the former Dahua Hotel site, creating an unprecedented spectacle in Shanghai. Hagenbeck is the owner of the Stellingen Zoo near Hamburg, Germany, and has long been known worldwide. His zoo collects rare and exotic animals from all over the world. Since Hagenbeck led the entire troupe of actors and animal performers to Japan, it has been two months, and the audience has been packed every day. The wonder and astonishment of the performances are self-evident. The troupe employs many world-renowned circus experts. Apart from those with extremely high salaries, there are about 300 people. The total number of staff members is close to 1,000. The animals they bring include 100 horses of various sizes, as well as lions, tigers, bears, wolves, deer, elephants, giraffes, rhinoceroses, camels, seals, and various other tame wild animals that accompany the troupe and are available for viewing. In recent years, there have been Western circuses coming to Shanghai, but none have been as grand as the Hagenbeck Circus this time. They will be performing in Shanghai for six weeks, which is unseen by the public and a visual feast.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Manager of the Jital Pawnshop in Taicang Embezzles 300,000 Yuan and Flees to Shanghai <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Taicang Detectives Come to Shanghai to Arrest</p>
<p>The Jital Pawnshop in Taicang County has been established for over a hundred years and has a considerable reputation in the local area. Therefore, it absorbs a lot of deposits. The manager position was held by Gu Shouxian from Suzhou. Gu was known for his long sleeves and good dancing skills and had extensive connections. Unexpectedly, in recent years, he had a sudden thought of engaging in private malpractices, unilaterally embezzling funds from the pawnshop. If it was not enough, he would use the name of Jital to smooth things over with local banks. Over time, he embezzled as much as 300,000 yuan. Because his own pockets were full, Gu abandoned his post and fled with his loot, hiding at No. 520 Dagu Road in Shanghai. He lived a carefree life and traveled to foreign venues. Little did he know that extreme joy breeds sorrow, and that a cunning rabbit with three burrows had already been discovered by the Taicang County government. Because Gu was a wanted criminal who had fled after embezzling funds, it was unacceptable for him to escape again. Yesterday, they urgently reported to the Xinzha police station and requested assistance in the arrest. The police chief added Chinese and Western detectives to rush to the address, arrest Gu Shouxian, and escort him to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Qian Wenji interrogated the police station's lawyer Li Zhishan, who explained the case. Judge Qian then interrogated Gu. The Taicang County government had not yet formally delivered documents to the court for extradition, so it was ordered that Gu remain in custody for seven days, pending the arrival of the documents for extradition and further investigation.</p>
<p>Zhao Ruquan No Misconduct</p>
<h3 id="e171">Two Types of Conclusive Evidence Found by the Police <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>丨Yesterday's Continued Interrogation of Zhao Jiaobao's Release on Bail丨</p>
<p>The Sanxing Stage on Niuzhuang Road was established as a joint venture by actors Zhao Ruquan, Du Wenlin, Mao Yunke, Xie Yuekui, Jia Biyun, and businessman Zhou Bingchen, with Zhou serving as the front-of-house manager and Xie as the backstage manager. However, because Zhao Ruquan was quite familiar with the theater's operations, all the shareholders elected Zhao to manage the finances. Recently, Zhou Bingchen discovered evidence of Zhao's embezzlement, amounting to over 30,000 yuan. He reported this to the Zhabei Police Station and requested an arrest warrant from the First Special Court. On the night of the 29th of last month, at 12:30 AM, Chinese Detective Chen Yonggui, Sergeant Yang Guanying, and Foreign Detective Hui Tuo went to the backstage of the Sanxing Stage, arrested Zhao, and handed him over to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Judge Feng Shide opened the court for continued interrogation. Zhou Bingchen hired lawyers Chen Rui, Du Jimei, and Yuan Yang'an to represent him, while Zhao Ruquan hired lawyers Jiang Yiping, Liu Shichao, and Shi Dubi to defend him. First, Police Officer Ru Baoyi stated that the police had found two types of conclusive evidence, totaling 1,214 yuan: 1) Advertising fees paid by the Lianshang Advertising Company to Zhao Ruquan, which Zhao received but did not record in the accounts; 2) Monthly interest of 10 taels from the 2,000 tael deposit at the Sheng Yi Electric Power Company, which Zhao also pocketed without recording it in the accounts. Zhao Zuwei, Zhao's accountant, is currently auditing the accounts and will report on them. The police have summoned Ma Zhongmou, Fu Guangting, and Liu Xianting, the three individuals from the Lianshang Company who paid the money to Zhao, and request that they be questioned.</p>
<p>Next, Zhou Bingchen submitted a statement claiming that on the "red ledger" copied and distributed by the defendant, only six yuan in advertising fees were recorded, which he discovered was not the actual amount. Furthermore, the capital of 21,000 yuan and the 10,000 yuan deposit were not indicated as being deposited in a money house, nor was there any interest from the money house. The matter is currently under investigation. Subsequently, Ma, Fu, and Liu testified that they handed the money to Zhao, totaling 1,250 yuan.</p>
<p>When asked, the defendant Zhao Ruquan claimed that regarding the advertising fees, because the contract was not yet fulfilled, he had stated to the shareholders at the end of last year that the distribution would be temporarily postponed. With the consent of the shareholders, he deposited the money in the Siming Bank and submitted a deposit book, as well as three other deposit books and eight packets of silver, and three accounting books to prove his impartiality. Witnesses Du Wenlin and Mao Yunke testified that Zhao had indeed stated about the advertising fees, but they could not confirm whether Zhou Bingchen was present at the time. Xu Junfu, the bookkeeper, also testified regarding the opening of the "red ledger" and that the advertising fee was not entered in the "red ledger" because the contract had not yet been fulfilled.</p>
<p>Police Officer Ru immediately stated that the police were currently investigating Xu for alleged collusion and embezzlement. After approximately three hours of proceedings, the court adjourned due to the late hour and announced that the hearing would resume next Friday afternoon. Lawyer Jiang immediately requested that Zhao be released on bail, but Lawyer Ru opposed this. The court stated that it would wait for the defendant to submit a written request to the court before making a decision. In the afternoon, Zhao submitted a written request to the court and was released on bail.</p>

<p>The Gospel for Those Suffering from Body Odor: Sufferers of body odor all deeply hate it. The field of medicine, however, has never been able to thoroughly solve the problem. The amount of people regretting it is countless. Now, a number of German medical Ph.D.s have co-founded the Chunzai Chemical Pharmaceutical Company in the French Concession, opposite the Franco-Chinese Academy in Junfu Lane. In order to adapt to the season, they have first launched a special medicine for treating body odor called "Hu Fox Arrow." The medicine is based on the eccrine gland system in pathology, pushing forward and transforming, tracing back to the source, and determining the differences between innate and acquired conditions. It combines ancient formulas and new methods according to clinical experimental scientific principles. Each dose has two sets of internal and external medicine, which should be prepared and administered according to the method. It can completely eradicate the condition in one treatment and, more miraculously, never recur. In order to benefit patients and enable them to attain happiness, the company has set a special low price. The innate medicine sells for 5 yuan, and the acquired medicine sells for 4.5 jiao.</p>

<p>Reader's Question</p>
<h3 id="e189">Why Complain and Blame Others? <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>A Letter from Mr. Wan, Jinan</p>
<p>Since I was young, I have been standing on the ugly and sordid side of society. To go a step further, the bad phenomena of the human world pour into my fragile brain every day. Unfortunately, my family is also declining day by day. My mother's gradually becoming thinner and more gloomy has deeply affected my inner self. So, I lost my vitality and courage. When I encountered external pressure, I could only fight back with patience and pain. As a result, a root of suspicion and fear was established in my inner self. Unfortunately, the banditry, which many people compare to floods and wild beasts, tore apart my already devastated family. My mother became a victim of this great calamity! My grandmother is temporarily living in the home of relatives in her hometown, and my wife is living in her maiden home. I am like a small boat floating in the vast sea. Today, I am tied to the side of this lonely island. Perhaps the wind will rise at night, and when I wake up tomorrow morning, I will be in another place! Not sinking is the ultimate happiness. I have not read many books. I have no specialized knowledge. Although I have spent several years in the ivory tower (here, the ivory tower is likened to a school, and it is a secondary school).</p>
<p>The introduction is over. I am sorry that I can only give you a faint impression!</p>
<p>As for human beings, except for innocent children, whether male or female, I dare not deeply believe that their hearts are pure and their thoughts are honest, especially the modern Chinese bureaucrats, politicians, and the X sticks that many people scold.</p>
<p>To society, I always feel that it is a deep black pool, or rather, it is a dung cellar. Everywhere there is only ugliness and stench.</p>
<p>Narrowing the scope a little, I feel only despair for China. Because I am convinced that the hearts of the Chinese people are selfish to the extreme. They have no sense of shame, no sense of love, especially like to play petty tricks, love to bully the weak, fawn over the strong, love to talk big, but do not love to do a small thing in reality. I feel only despair for such a nation. Even a glimmer of hope has been extinguished. Sometimes I think: If there is a person in front of me who can truly be not despicable and tricky at all, and has only a passionate heart, a heart to love all people, and a heart to help all people, then I would definitely fall into his arms and cry bitterly to thank him for giving me an ideal true human being.</p>
<p>In short, my eyes seem to be covered with a layer of dark web.</p>
<p>My inner self, at this moment, has the strongest demand: "How can I contribute my personal strength to society and to the people?" Because at this moment, I am still playing the role of a small clerk and I still do not have a real occupation.</p>
<p>I have thought about (and I am still thinking about it), it would be best if I could apply for some kind of reclamation department somewhere, and after graduation, go to the northwestern frontier, which is close to primitive humans. There, I can cultivate the land myself and forget everything in the past and start another life of joy.</p>
<p>I wrote in a chaotic and incoherent way. Let me sort out my questions!</p>
<p>1. Are society and humanity ugly and sordid, or not? Is my understanding of society and humanity comprehensive or one-sided?</p>
<p>2. Is life happy or painful? What methods should be used to obtain happiness?</p>
<p>3. What should be the criteria for seeking a job? What are the most beneficial jobs for society and the people at present?</p>
<p>These questions may not be worth asking, but they are some of the pains that I am anxious to solve. Gentlemen, please focus on this point and give me a troublesome answer!</p>
<p>In addition to the answers, if you can introduce some books that can be prescribed to the symptoms and call me to buy and read them, so that I can get a thorough solution, that would be the best. (Reply will be published tomorrow)</p>

<p>This year's Shanghai International Games opened yesterday at the China Athletic Field. Athletes from nine countries gathered to compete in men's and women's events. The elite were assembled, and the results were excellent. Over a thousand spectators attended, showing great interest. Wang Zhengting, Honorary Chairman of the Games, and Mayor Wu, Honorary President, both personally attended the opening ceremony. The competition results were particularly outstanding. In the 400m relay, our country's Huáng Fēilóng, Dǒng Yínchū, Wáng Jìlín, and Chéng Jīnguàn set a new national record of 46 seconds flat, breaking the previous record of 46.6 seconds held by the Beiping team. However, this was still far from the Games record of 44.8 seconds (created by the Americans). In addition, Xue Puhan's (English) 52.1 seconds in the 400m preliminary, Ms. Bai Naide's long jump of 4.875 meters, high jump of 1.405 meters, 100m of 13.4 seconds, and the American women's team's 55 seconds in the 400m relay all exceeded our country's highest records. As for the championship situation, our country has the best chance in the men's events, having already scored 32 points yesterday. The United States is second with 11 points. In the women's events, the United States is guaranteed the championship. All finals will be held today. Special results will appear one after another. Hopefully, our country's athletes will not be content with winning championships but will strive for special achievements. Our country's highest records must not be broken by athletes from other countries but must be surpassed by ourselves. We must not allow athletes from other countries to take all the glory. It should be known that our country's athletes are the elite of the nation. Now, competing with overseas Chinese and foreign athletes in Shanghai, they should rightfully win. The creation of new records is what we expect. Strive, strive!</p>

<p>A gentle breeze brushed the faces as they circled the venue, with thin clouds covering the sky. The athletes from nine countries entered the venue one after another. After a while, the McGinnis military band in front of the podium began to play, the music melodious and uplifting, majestic and stirring. Soon, the announcer stepped onto the stage and ordered the athletes from each country to enter in order and parade around the field. The military band led the way, followed by the staff. Next were the Chinese female athletes, followed by the American and British teams. Then, they were arranged according to the number of athletes, with the Chinese athletes last, showing their humility and hospitality. The athletes' uniforms were neat and their steps were synchronized, making it a spectacular sight.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech After circling the field once, all the athletes faced the podium, and Honorary President Mayor Wu stepped onto the stage to deliver a speech, which was translated by Shěn Sìliáng. He briefly stated that the annual Shanghai International Games has arrived again. Looking back at the spirit and achievements of previous sessions, they have indeed improved with each passing day, which is a gratifying thing. As transportation has become increasingly convenient, the concept of segregation among human races has been abolished at an early date. Shanghai, as an important place for international gatherings, has greatly benefited from the International Games in terms of international friendship. We sincerely hope that all athletes will improve their performance in the future, and that international friendship will also progress with it.</p>

<p>White Doves Flying: At the opening of the Olympic Games, white doves are often released, sometimes in the thousands, to symbolize peace. This time, the Shanghai International Games also followed this example, with over sixty carrier pigeons packed in three cages and brought to the venue. Colored paper strips were tied to the tails of the pigeons in advance. As soon as Mayor Wu finished speaking, the three cages were released simultaneously. Each pigeon trailed colored paper as it soared into the sky, looking from afar like long-tailed phoenixes of the nine heavens, truly a spectacular sight.</p>
<p>Beginning of the Games: Then, with the audience cheering and applauding, Honorary Chairman Wang Zhengting announced the beginning of the Games. The warriors entered the field, waiting quietly for the order to display their talents, and the air suddenly became tense.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Overview of Field Events <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The field event finals included three men's events and two women's events. Wáng Jìhuái's long jump of 6.705 meters almost broke Pān Zuòxīn's national record of 6.74 meters and was the most satisfying result for Chinese athletes yesterday. As for the women's events, they were all won by American women. Bái Nàidè's outstanding records were awe-inspiring. A brief description is given below:</p>
<h3 id="e206">㈠ Unexpected Disappointment in the Discus <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The discus was won by the Russian Mìluònuòfū in the previous Games with a throw of 35.42 meters, breaking his own record of 34.89 meters. The Chinese athletes participating included three generals: Lěng Péigēn, Gōng Wànyù, and Chén Bǎoqíu. In the first three throws, Lěng Péigēn was in first place with 34.45 meters. Unexpectedly, in the last three throws, Mìluònuòfū surpassed him in the sixth throw with 35.42 meters. Judging from this result, all three of Lěng, Gōng, and Chén have repeatedly exceeded this number on weekdays. Lěng regressed, and Gōng and Chén both failed to qualify. Gōng only managed 33 meters, and Chén managed 32 meters. It was a truly unexpected defeat. The scores of the four people are as follows:</p>
<p>First: Mìluònuòfū (Russia) 35.42 meters (New Games Record)</p>
<p>Second: Lěng Péigēn (China) 34.45 meters</p>
<p>Third: Huáwéikè (United States) 33.49 meters</p>
<p>Fourth: Mòtuōfūjīn (Russia) 33.49 meters</p>
<p>Appendix: Fifth: Fúlāsāi (England) 31.84 meters</p>
<p>Appendix: Sixth: Huìwéigè (Latvia) 31.84 meters</p>
<h3 id="e207">㈡ Wáng Jìhuái's Long Jump Masterpiece <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Wáng Jìhuái won the long jump with 6.705 meters, just 0.035 meters short of the national record. It is said that Wáng once took a step backwards during this jump, otherwise,</p>
<p>He would have exceeded Pān Zuòxīn's record. During the fifth jump, Wang also had an excellent attempt, but it was invalidated for stepping over the board by half an inch, which was a pity. This was one of the most outstanding events for Chinese athletes yesterday. In the first three jumps, Wang was first, Wú Jǐnqí was second, and Chén Bǎoqíu was third. The Japanese, Xiǎosōng, was fourth, and the American, Shǐ Huángkè, was fifth. The Japanese, Gāng, was sixth. Unexpectedly, in the last, sixth jump, Xiǎosōng suddenly surpassed Wú Jǐnqí with 6.65 meters, and Gāng surpassed Shǐ Huángkè and Chén Bǎoqíu with 6.54 meters. The results of the six people are as follows:</p>
<p>First: Wáng Jìhuái (China) 6.705 meters (New Games Record)</p>
<p>Second: Xiǎosōng (Japan) 6.65 meters (New Games Record)</p>
<p>Third: Wú Jǐnqí (China) 6.61 meters (New Games Record)</p>
<p>Fourth: Gāng (Japan) 6.54 meters (New Games Record)</p>
<p>Appendix: Fifth: Shǐ Huángkè (United States) 6.51 meters (New Games Record)</p>
<p>Appendix: Sixth: Chén Bǎoqíu (China) 6.21 meters</p>
<h3 id="e208">㈢ The Chinese Team Dominates the High Jump <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's high jump was the most successful event for the Chinese team, taking the top three spots. Wú Jǐnqí's winning jump of 1.73 meters can also be considered a rare achievement. It is said that Gù's performance was equal to that of Chén Líng. Gù came second, one place behind Wu. Fourth place went to Huìwéigè of Latvia. The Chinese team scored an additional ten points in this event, greatly increasing their position for the championship.</p>
<h3 id="e209">㈣ Bái Nàidè's Astonishing Results <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>In the women's long jump, American Bái Nàidè narrowly lost to Zhuāng Míngzhēn last year by 0.01 meters. This year, she unexpectedly created a result of 4.875 meters, with her rapid progress being impressive. Tāngmǔshēng came second with 4.86 meters. This kind of record is unimaginable for Chinese women. Chén Shūqīng and Chén Róngmíng came third and fourth. Both Bái and Tāng broke the Chinese record. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>First: Bái Nàidè (United States) 4.875 meters (New Games Record)</p>
<p>Second: Tāngmǔshēng (England) 4.86 meters (New Games Record)</p>
<p>Third: Chén Shūqīng (China) 4.47 meters</p>
<p>Fourth: Chén Róngmíng (China) 4.43 meters</p>
<p>Appendix: Fifth: Qián Hángsù (China) 4.37 meters</p>
<p>In the high jump, this event was entirely dominated by blue-eyed, blond-haired people. Chinese women are far from being able to compete, with a significant difference in performance. The top three all exceeded the Chinese national record by a large margin. Bái Nàidè won with 1.405 meters, which is also an unimaginable result for Chinese women. Second place, Bào'ěr, had the same result as Bái Nàidè, but voluntarily gave up second place. Englishman Tāngmǔshēng was third, and American Tuōtuō'ěr was fourth. Such results for women are truly astonishing.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Track Finals <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>In the 1500 meters, twenty people participated. Our country's Dǒng Shūzhāo took the lead from the start, with Englishman Huálín and American Sāiwéisī following behind. After two laps, Sāiwéisī moved ahead, and Kèlèigé and Méngsī accelerated, competing fiercely for the lead. In the last hundred meters, Dǒng Shūzhāo and Sāiwéisī were neck and neck. Kèlèigé greatly increased his speed, beating Sāiwéisī by a shoulder at the finish line. The time was four minutes and twenty-five seconds. Dǒng Shūzhāo was third, and Méngsī was fourth, all with very little difference.</p>
<p>The previous champion in the men's relay was the United States. China was determined to take revenge. This time, with a wealth of talent, the hopes were naturally high. From the beginning, everything went smoothly. The first runner, Huáng Fēilóng, was ahead by a step. The second runner, Dǒng Yínchū, was extremely agile. The third runner, Wáng Jìhuái, sprinted very effectively. The fourth runner, Chéng Jīnguàn, led the pack and secured first place with a time of 46 seconds, setting a new national record for our country and breaking the previous national record of 46.6 seconds held by Beiping. The United States was second, far behind. Japan was third, and England was fourth. The lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Team First Runner Second Runner Third Runner Fourth Runner ㈠ China Huáng Fēilóng Dǒng Yínchū Wáng Jìhuái Chéng Jīnguàn ㈡ United States Lāsīmòshēng Tāng Shǐlái Qù Fúyēlā Xǔ ㈢ Japan Gāngběn Qímù Xiǎosōng Gāng ㈣ England Mǎlín Màikègāo Kèlèigé Xuě Pūhàn</p>
<p>There were three countries in the women's relay. Our country's relay technique was not quick and sharp enough, resulting in third place. The American team won the championship with a time of 55 seconds, breaking the previous record of 57.8 seconds. England hesitated during the final leg, causing them to fall behind. Otherwise, they could have competed with the United States for the championship. The Chinese women were always in last place. The lineup of each country is as follows:</p>
<p>Team First Runner Second Runner Third Runner Fourth Runner ㈠ United States Bào'ěr Pōlín Sī Tuōtuō'ěr Bái Nàidè ㈢ England Tuōmǔshēng Bólóufēióutè Láilā Bó'ēn ㈡ China Qián Hángsù Chén Róngmíng Dǒng Jiéyīng Chén Shūqīng</p>

<h3 id="e221">Preliminary and Quarterfinal Rounds Report <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Men's 100 Meters Begins: The first event was the Men's 100 Meters Preliminary Round, divided into four groups, with the top three from each group advancing. In the first group, the American, Yellach, was the fastest with 11.2 seconds, followed by Japan's Oka in second, and Germany's Parker in third. The competition was fierce. Unfortunately, China's Wang Jihuai encountered a strong group, fought hard but finished fourth, and was eliminated. The first place finishers in the following three groups were all Chinese athletes, but their times were not good. The American star Tom Slay lost to Cheng Jinguan, and Russia's Tomshas Gai fell. After the preliminary round, there was a ten-minute break before the quarterfinals. Yellach again won the championship, with Oka still behind Yellach. Huang Feilong fought hard to get third, with a time of 11.7 seconds, much slower than the preliminary round. In the second group, Cheng Jinguan also took first place with a time of 11.4 seconds, better than in the preliminary round. Chen Jiayou was not selected.</p>
<p>Women's 50 Meters Second Event Preliminary Round: The second event was the Women's 50 Meters. The American girl, White, is a famous star in this event, and the British Thompson is also not a weak contender. The two had a fierce competition. Qian Hangsu was third, and Sheng Bi was fourth and did not advance. White achieved the best time of 7.2 seconds. In the second group, the American Powell took first, and Chen Shuqing and Chen Baoxiang took second and third. It is likely that the champion and runner-up in the final will not be from China.</p>
<p>Men's 200 Meters, Four Groups Preliminary Round: The British Shepperd Han was the fastest with 23.5 seconds, followed by the American Yellach with 23.6 seconds in second. The Japanese Little Oka encountered Yellach in both the 100-meter preliminary and quarterfinal rounds. He met Yellach again in the 200 meters. Oka was defeated each time. Huang Feilong and Cheng Jinguan performed reasonably well. Dong Yinchu did not encounter strong opponents in the preliminary round, and his results were slightly worse. In the quarterfinals, Shepperd Han achieved only 23 seconds, defeating the American general Yellach. Huang Feilong finished third. Cheng Jinguan defeated Dong Yinchu and Lava Fu, with a time of 23.2 seconds. There will definitely be a fierce battle in the final, as their strengths are not far apart. Generally, Shepperd Han may win the championship, Yellach will be second, Cheng Jinguan third, and the remaining three will compete for fourth. The Japanese Little Oka was eliminated in the quarterfinals.</p>
<p>High Hurdles: Chen Ling is an experienced athlete in this event. His preliminary time was 17.4 seconds. He can reliably win first place in the final. West German football star Parker also has a time of 17.8 seconds, which is enough to give Chen Ling a good battle. Russian pentathlon champion, Mironov, is also not weak.</p>
<p>Middle Hurdles: China has Tao Yingjie, Chen Ling, and Da Mao Sun Huipei. There is hope for a sweep of the top three in the final. In yesterday's preliminary round, Chen encountered [Tao] in the same group, and there was a fierce battle. Chen Ling was ahead of Tao Yingjie at one point, but in the last 100 meters, Tao came out on top, taking first with 60.8 seconds. Chen Ling was not far behind. Sun Huipei followed closely, with a good time of 61 seconds. Mironov was no match for them.</p>
<p>400 Meters: Flying-footed Shepperd Han finished in only 52.1 seconds, breaking China's highest record of 52.4 seconds held by Liu Changchun. Deng Kaier finished in 54 seconds. Those from China who entered [the competition] were Guan Changfa, Zeng Rongzhong, He Debao, and Liu Fukang.</p>
<p>Women's 100 Meters: Ms. White finished in just 13.4 seconds, and although she did not catch up with Ms. Thompson's 13.2 seconds from last year, she surpassed Sun Guiyun's Chinese national record of 13.8 seconds. This year's Thompson is in poor condition, losing to White. Qian Hangsu was third. In another group, the American Powell was first with 14.1 seconds, and Chen Shuqing was second. China has very little hope in today's final.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Obstacle Demonstration <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>In this conference, McKenna, who is enthusiastic about sports, launched an obstacle race (also known as steeplechase) demonstration to show his promotion. He also asked Chinese athletes to join, so many people joined. A small pool was dug at one end of the field, and an obstacle made of rice straw was set up. At the other two ends of the field, hurdles were placed. The distance was 1,000, and it was run around three times. Many Chinese athletes did not achieve good results because they had no training. When someone jumped for the first time, they fell into the pool because they didn't know how to do it properly. This was very funny. Many foreigners were experienced. As a result: 1st) Lefkin Gujia (Russia), 2nd) Mons (England), 3rd) Taitilifu (Russia), 4th) Levisdong (Russia), with a time of three minutes and 27.6 seconds.</p>

<h3 id="e226">Random Thoughts on Loquats <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Loquats are yellow, the young and old hide them, the nanny is busy. I don't know who made this nine-character nursery rhyme, but it is a wonderful saying with great value for circulation. Du Mu's "The six states being defeated, the world united; the mountains of Shu being rugged, the Afang Palace arising," is not as natural and interesting as the three sentences of "Loquats are yellow." Someone said, "When depicting singing girls, why necessarily use singing girls, so the wonder of this nine-character nursery rhyme lies in using "Loquats are yellow" as a lead-in."</p>
<p>Shen Shitian's friend sent loquats as a gift, mistakenly writing it as pipa. Shitian replied in a letter: "Thank you for the pipa, opening the box was quite a shock; listening to it is silent, eating it is flavorful. Now I understand why Sima cried at Xunyang in ancient times, and Mingfei complained on the borderlands, all for the sake of a bite." The words in the old man Shitian's letter are extremely humorous. According to this, the names pipa and loquat could be used interchangeably in ancient times, but writing pipa as loquat is acceptable, while writing loquat as pipa is not. The old man Shitian's teasing words are not abusive.</p>
<p>The Compilation of Chicken Ribs records seedless loquats in Guangzhou, indicating that seedless loquats are not a rare species. Zhu Zhuotuo from Xiushui was friendly with a Taoist priest. There were two loquat trees in the Taoist temple. When the fruits were ripe, he picked them and sent them to Zhu, all of which were seedless. Zhu asked the Taoist priest about the planting method. The Taoist priest said, "The immortals planted them." Zhu didn't believe it. Knowing that the Taoist priest liked to eat steamed pork, Zhu invited the Taoist priest to drink and ordered a servant to buy a pig's trotter, deliberately letting the Taoist priest see it. In no time, the pig's trotter was cooked. When served to the guests, the meat was fragrant and particularly delicious. The Taoist priest asked Zhu, "How can it be cooked so quickly?" Zhu said, "I have a method to cook pig trotters in an instant." The Taoist priest asked to be taught this method. Zhu said, "Please exchange the method of planting seedless loquats with me." The Taoist priest said, "Easy, easy. When the flowers bloom, pluck out a pistil from the center, and the result will be seedless. I have already taught you. Please teach me the method of cooking pig trotters in an instant." Zhu said, "The pig trotters that the servant bought have not been cooked yet. What you just ate was cooked the previous night." After saying this, host and guest clapped their hands and burst into laughter.</p>
<h3 id="e227">On Dogs <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Ti</p>
<p>Almost every household keeps a dog, or two or three. Except for foreign women, who keep them as pets, or for other needs, most are used to guard the house at night.</p>
<p>When it comes to the responsibility of a dog, guarding the house at night is also not small, but they never neglect their duty. First, they watch the door during the day or guard at night, and when they hear a knock, they bark loudly. Although they do not rest their heads on spears, they can be ready for orders. Second, within a household, they will never listen to one person's command to bite another. Third, when they hear the call of their kind, unless they are tied with a leash or locked in a cage, they will definitely run out to help. Even if they cannot go out, they will jump and bark wildly, remotely voicing their support. And it is heartfelt support.</p>
<p>From this, we know that although dogs are lower animals, they are loyal to their owners, loyal to their responsibilities, and full of mutual assistance.</p>
<p>We, who are called the soul of all things, should, in theory, be much higher than them. At the very least, we should be like them. Who knew we would be worse than them. There are many people whose responsibility is equal to that of a dog: watching the door and guarding the night. But when they hear a knock, they don't make a sound. When they see strangers, they seem to know them well, tucking their tails between their legs and turning away. However, within a household, they can listen to commands and bite people indiscriminately, with extreme ferocity, like a mad dog. Now, chased from outside the gate to the corner of the wall, although they are barking, they dare not bite back even once. Their kind—the soul of all things in the world—is not tied with a leash, nor is it locked in a cage, and although a few bark twice behind the door—it is not sincere support—they are never willing to come out to jump a few times or bite a few times.</p>
<p>We know that many of these people are not loyal to their owners, not loyal to their responsibilities, and have no spirit of mutual assistance for their kind. They cannot be equal to dogs, and perhaps they are not even as good as dogs. Therefore, now China does not necessarily need people, but cannot do without dogs; cannot do without sincere, loving, loyal, brave, and mutually assisting dogs!</p>

<p>Rights and obligations are undoubtedly relative, but enjoying rights does not necessarily mean being loyal to one's obligations. Only women's guardians, loyal ministers, and filial sons stand side by side, helping them take off their shoes, put on clothes, wash small handkerchiefs, and prepare milk at home; wherever they are, they are afraid of hurting even a single hair on their precious ones; even though they only have a pair of bare hands, is their power any different from those who hold guns? Sometimes it causes jealousy, especially among single men, right? Or harboring some kind of mentality, pretending not to see it, right? Women are always standing on proud ground.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Interesting Talk About Cigarettes <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>"A cigarette after a meal is better than being a god," those who enjoy smoking naturally have such an attitude. In fact, after drinking and tea, early in the morning and late at night, are the best times to smoke; it's truly "a cigarette in hand, feeling like an immortal."</p>
<p>I have never smoked. No matter how high-quality the cigarette, I can't understand it and dare not touch my lips. It can be said that I have no connection with cigarettes. But saying I have no connection is like I do; because you are always surrounded by cigarettes in public places, trapping you in an atmosphere of smoke. It makes you dizzy and unable to escape. Especially when playing mahjong with friends. They smoke constantly and throw the leftover cigarette butts on the ground. The smell of cigarette urine is even more unpleasant. Sometimes I say to them, "You invite me to play mahjong. No matter how clever your tactics, I'm not afraid. Only when you unite and launch a 'smoke screen' am I really a little scared." Everyone laughs when I say that!</p>
<p>Although I don't smoke, I often hold a cigar in my fingers. This also "Jesus has his reasons." Because when you are out, if people ask you to smoke, it seems inhuman to refuse. Secretly, they will inevitably say you are a fool who can't even smoke. So I thought of a way: take a cigar as a "block." Then, looking dignified, people will no longer offer you cigarettes. However, this cigar must be held in hand for at least a week or two weeks.</p>
<p>Some smoking friends do not discard the leftover cigarette butts. First, they gently tap the whole cigarette on the table a few times, and then moisten the cigarette butt with saliva and stick it back on. This is repeated over and over, leaving no residue. This kind of waste utilization can be considered the most economical way to smoke. But the poor man "catching crickets" who sees this will inevitably shake his head and sigh, saying that there is no way to make a living anymore (picking up cigarette butts on the road is called "catching crickets" in slang).</p>
<p>The most fun is smoking with a lover. The man takes a puff and passes it to the woman. The woman takes a puff and passes it back to the man, breathing each other's breath. But if others see it, they will always say you are "being sickening for fun."</p>
<p>People who are addicted to smoking always have some traces of being burned by cigarette ash on their clothes, indicating their smoking achievements. But even if you don't smoke, others will leave you some souvenirs. One day, I wore a brand new mandarin jacket to the bookstore to listen to a story, sitting upright, looking like "sacred and inviolable." Unexpectedly, when I got home, I found two cigarette burns on the back of the jacket. Besides saying a few words of pity, there was no other way. This was truly a "causeless disaster"!</p>

<p>Chapter 8: Angry Words Provoke Youth to Resign and Flee, Enthusiastic Pity for Young Girl Brings Padded Clothing in Person</p>
<p>Houzhi sat at his desk, hands pressed on the table, eyes wide open, staring at people, making a show of exerting all his strength. Jizhi could only hang his hands down and stand straight at the corner, waiting for his older brother to finish scolding. However, Houzhi's last word, "scram," was not something he could endure. His face red, he said, "I haven't committed any major mistake, so why should I be told to scram?" Jizhi slammed the table and said, "I'm telling you to scram, what can you do about it?" Jizhi didn't say anything more, immediately walked out, returned to his own office, took a piece of draft paper, and hurriedly wrote a resignation letter on the table, saying: "Respectfully Submitted: Jizhi, holding a subordinate position, follows the law and regulations, and believes that there is no great fault. However, the director has repeatedly rebuked and shown no kindness. Reflecting on myself, I cannot understand the reason. Perhaps because Jizhi is suspected of bias toward people or matters, and treads upon the director's rule of avoiding relatives in appointments, I will draw the firewood from under the cauldron, and then boil beans to burn the stalks. A brave man cuts off his wrist, and it is not without necessity. Jizhi has read books and knows how to love himself. I am not willing to receive the grievances of three anxieties for the sake of one branch's existence. Therefore, I respectfully request to be relieved of my position as section member, to preserve Jizhi's personality, and to slightly relieve the director's burden. In closing, I am filled with extreme fear. Respectfully submitted to the Director. Section Member Gan Jizhi respectfully presents."</p>
<p>After Jizhi had copied it neatly, he gave it to the errand boy and asked him to send it to the director. He put on his coat and immediately walked out of the yamen, heading home. At this time, he felt that the sky was wide and the sea was vast, and he could go anywhere, completely free from any restrictions. His heart felt much better. When he got home, he ignored everyone, quickly checked his suitcases, and rolled up his luggage. He was packing in the room for an hour before the old nanny came in to bring boiled water, only then seeing this situation. She was very surprised and asked, "Second Master, what are you doing?" Jizhi smiled and said, "Nothing at all." The old nanny said, "Since you are doing nothing, why are you rolling up your luggage and packing your suitcases? It seems like you are going out. Where are you going?" Jizhi smiled and said, "Where am I going? Even I can't say for sure." The old nanny said, "If you can't say where you are going, why are you moving away?" Jizhi smiled and said, "Don't you know this? This is not my home!" (89)</p>

<p>— Zhou Zheng</p>
<p>(A Message to Mr. Sun Yat-sen) Mr. Sun Yat-sen, it has been eight years since you left this world. In these eight years, do you know how our Republic of China is now? Do you know, Mr. Sun? I think you will definitely answer without hesitation: "The current Republic of China has already embarked on the right track, and has also realized the Three Principles of the People, the Five-Power Constitution, the Founding Strategy, and the Founding Outline. The warlords in the country have been overthrown, and both foreign and internal conflicts have been extinguished. The unequal treaties have also been abolished. The country is rich, and the people's livelihood is not impoverished." Alas, Mr. Sun Yat-sen! You know this is completely wrong. The current China is in a time of urgent foreign troubles. The three northeastern provinces and all of Rehe have been replaced by the Rising Sun flag. The warlords in the country have made a beautiful China look like a mess. Mr. Sun Yat-sen, are you not sad when you hear what I say? I think you must feel sad. The cute autumn begonia leaf has a corner eaten by insects. This is so unfortunate! (Zhang Jiaju)</p>
<p>(Hell on Earth) The compassionate Spring God has been working hard for many days like arrows, tidying everything up, leaving the world of mortals, and going to bed to rest quietly. The cruel Summer God, awakening in that hazy sleeping place, led his children, Mr. Sun and Miss Dewdrop, staggering to the world of mortals.</p>
<p>On the west side of that prosperous metropolis, there was a tragic sound, from that dilapidated thatched cottage, sobbing and moaning, chasing away the silent demons.</p>
<p>A young man wearing a dark green suit and a stiff shirt walked leisurely forward, passing by the door of the house. An old woman, half a century old, with wrinkles on her face like waves, knelt in front of the young man at the door, grabbed him, and cried: "Young master! Please do a good deed and save the poor. My son died today. Our whole family relies on him for food. Since he died, how can we survive? We also have no money for burial. What can we do? Please have some mercy and save the poor!" The young man said: "Get lost! You poor ghosts! How can a rich young man like me talk to you poor ghosts? Get lost! Get lost! Get lost!" He patted off the handprints on his pants and went to the dance hall without even turning his head. (Zhou Zheng)</p>
<p>(Oppression) In a prosperous and lively city, it was at the beginning of dawn. In a thatched cottage on the east side of the city, there was an old woman with snow-white eyebrows and hair, next to a young child, wailing and crying for something to eat, but the old woman's two oily eyes were shining on the pot, "Is there anything?" There wasn't! It had already been eaten, not even half a grain of rice left. Two hot tears kept flowing from her eye sockets.</p>
<p>A rent collector, with a big belly, a few rat whiskers beside his mouth, and a leather bag in his hand, strode into the thatched cottage.</p>
<p>Entering the door, he shouted loudly, "Twelve yuan for this month's rent, quickly pay up! There can be no arrears this month!"</p>
<p>Sobbing, she said, "Sir...sir, save...save my life, I don't even have food, how can I have silvery dollars? Please spare my life!"</p>
<p>The rent collector raised his lips like hills and said, "Bullshit! Don't be too long-winded, quickly pay the money! No can do! No can do!"</p>
<p>The rent collector took the old woman to the station. The wretched old woman suffered the flavor of iron bars, washing her dry face with hot tears all day long. (Zhou Zheng)</p>

<h3 id="e232">Don't Want Freedom <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>Many people want freedom, talking about it all the time, and some are willing to exchange hot blood for it. But what is freedom? How can things living on this earth have freedom? Even our own feet can't leave the ground successfully. Moreover, this earth is such a small part of space. When we think of the vastness of the entire universe, we will only be ashamed of our insignificance, so what face do we have to clamor for freedom?</p>
<p>We won't have any kind of freedom. Death gives a fatal threat. When we think of death, all value is gone. What's left of freedom or no freedom? If we want to fly, we don't have wings. If we want to dive, we lack fish scales. Running makes us slower than horses or deer. Climbing trees makes us worse than monkeys. Wrestling makes us weaker than cows. Being ferocious makes us worse than tigers or wolves. Being greedy for money makes us worse than corrupt officials, local tyrants, and bad gentry. Hey, corrupt officials and local tyrants are also people. I said the wrong thing.</p>
<p>But what I mean is that our innate abilities are not great, and we can't do whatever we want. So it's best not to talk about freedom. Humans will never have freedom unless it's an unborn fetus in the mother's womb that has some freedom to speak of. As soon as they are born into this world, freedom will no longer exist. Because the establishment of freedom takes life as a prerequisite. Now, when solving the bread-and-butter issues of life is still a major problem, we can't talk about freedom.</p>
<p>Who in this world has ever had freedom? Who has ever had freedom? No one has. However, limited freedom, freedom permitted by law, that can exist, such as freedom of religion, freedom of speech, etc. But what does it matter if you have these freedoms? Moreover, many people's freedom results in many people's lack of freedom. Freedom that can have conflicts is not a good thing. For example, if people have freedom of speech, officials' behavior becomes unfree. If people have freedom of religion, missionaries are not free to force you to believe in their religion. That's not very appropriate.</p>
<p>So I want to shout out the slogan "Don't Want Freedom." We should all conform to the rules, without any personal freedom. Officials cannot freely arrest and kill people, cannot freely plunder money, cannot freely violate the law and harm the people. No one can freely sell out the country, buy Japanese goods. Everyone cannot freely donate to aviation to save the country, cannot freely buy aviation construction lottery tickets, and cannot freely dance and entertain to save the country. In this way, the situation in Chinese society might improve. I sometimes really think that China has been bad throughout history because it has been too free. Everyone has forgotten that they are a member of society and only knows themselves. The new society that will emerge will certainly not allow this kind of thought and feeling.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Untitled <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Ju Ren</p>
<p>Long ago, in a book discussing physics, I saw an explanation of the origin of menstruation. Our ancestors, living in caves, faced dark nights and strong winds. They hid, afraid to venture out. Only when the sky cleared and the moon was full would they emerge for some fresh air. Over time, this influenced women's menstruation, causing it to follow the lunar cycle, occurring once a month without fail. Only with "flowers before the moon" do we have stories of talented scholars and beautiful women; such is the law established by our ancestors. Therefore, the success of marriages is attributed to the Old Man Under the Moon!</p>
<p>An unwritten, widespread belief considers menstruation to be an ominous thing. When menstruation occurs, women are absolutely forbidden from stepping over scales, rulers, bushels, or other such everyday objects. A certain rickshaw puller, because his cushion was soiled by a female passenger, washed it and then burned paper ingots to dispel bad luck. Menstrual blood is apparently like a poison gas bomb, spreading misfortune wherever it goes. With mysterious taboos comes mysterious efficacy. The Portuguese imported "red-clothed cannons" were actually used in battle during the Chongzhen reign of the Ming Dynasty. The only magical item to defeat these cannons was women's menstrual cloths; when hung all over the city, cannonballs would not fly, and the cannon itself would crack. Tradition held this to be incredibly effective. Menstruation could also ward off lightning. A certain unfilial woman abused her parents-in-law, a sin so great that the Thunder God was sent down to strike her dead. The woman took a soiled cloth and covered her head, and the Thunder God dared not strike. These national essence experts of spiritual civilization, with a heart to save the world, could very well compile a book on the physics and chemistry of menstruation, achieving immortality alongside a certain president's Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<p>Menstruation can be seen but not spoken of. Even writing about it is almost impossible; such is the situation. Modern ladies in high heels and flowing qipaos can dance the foxtrot to the music. Yet, when menstruation is mentioned, they all blush. Their views are no different from the rickshaw puller who burns paper ingots to dispel bad luck. Since the May Fourth Movement, women's movements have shouted their slogans with earth-shattering volume, but to no effect. People don't understand why. I say: Just observe how menstruation still retains a mysterious significance, as if not going to the City God Temple to see about misdeeds or worshipping Buddha. It can be determined that the women's movement has no fate!</p>
<p>A few days ago, I received a monthly magazine run by a certain Mrs., with signatures like "Zhang Huang" Mrs. and "Li Zhu" Madam. The editor-in-chief also leads by example, going by the name XY Mrs. I imagine those Mrs. must also approve of the theory of menstruation as mysterious and the theory of the marvelous effects of menstruation.</p>
<h3 id="e234">Night of the Metropolis <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>On Saturday evening, the city, dyed charming by the lights, was excitedly bustling. On Avenue Joffre, blue gaslights and red neon lights hid by the sidewalks, smiling. A child afflicted with the urban paleness disease was shouting, mouth wide open, "Extra! Late Night News!" At the entrance of a longtang, an old man, so gaunt that only a layer of brownish-yellow skin remained, was holding a bowl of pitch-black "tap water," gulping it down...</p>
<p>A foreign sailor, humming "Lili Marlene," staggered out of a saloon, drunk. His leather boots scraped against the cement. "Rickshaw!" He raised his hand as if taking an oath, and three people leaned on each other like boneless skeletons.</p>
<p>Seven or eight rickshaws rushed over like a tide. A young rickshaw puller who had not yet "opened for business" was slapped for blocking the way. The rickshaw pullers who had gotten a fare had slight smiles painted on their faces, transporting their masters to North Sichuan Road to find "salty water girls" for the night.</p>
<p>A young woman with a well-balanced black, white, and red complexion had her arm linked in an old gentleman's arm. Glancing at the old man's small, eight-shaped mustache, she chirped in a charming little voice, "Xiao Zhou, you promised me the diamond ring; you must give it to me tomorrow!" They walked rhythmically together toward the French Park.</p>
<p>The metropolis, in the glaring light of the incandescent lamps, shone on a wandering foreigner—a White Russian (ten years ago, he never dreamed of being poor; now, even in his sleep, he dreams of the wealth of St. Petersburg). He muttered behind a couple, a man and a woman. Two coppers were scooped out from the young man's billfold, stuffed full of banknotes. In the darkness, a ragged, starving old woman, with a hopeful, bitter smile, followed close behind.</p>
<p>"Kind sir, kind lady, please spare a little!"</p>
<p>"What's the matter?" The young woman glanced at her "little treasure" beside her. "Linlin, I'm annoyed even by seeing Chinese beggars; look!"</p>
<p>"Me too. Chinese beggars are dirty and smelly. Get lost! I hardly ever saw a beggar in America."</p>
<p>At the entrance of a longtang on Mindeli, an old clerk walked in with his salary for the month. He was calculating whether he could remit a few yuan home after deducting food and lodging. Suddenly, a "skinning pig" darted out from the darkness, pointing half a rotten banana from his large sleeve at him.</p>
<p>"Hey, friend! You know what's good for you..."</p>
<p>The night of the metropolis was excitedly noisy.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Hometown Rain <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>The spring in Jiangnan is known for its frequent rains, often lasting seven or eight days at a stretch. People living in Shanghai usually do not feel the need for rain. Once it starts raining, the weather is so gloomy that no one can stand being cooped up in their small homes. But when you go outside, there are no mountains, no lakes, and no tender green leaves washed by the rain. Everything is better on a sunny day. Sometimes, a wealthy person's car speeds past you, and you have to return home covered in mud.</p>
<p>I remember when I first came to Shanghai to study six or seven years ago, the schoolwork was especially busy, often requiring self-study until the afternoon. That year happened to be particularly rainy, and the drizzling rain often disturbed my mood while reading. Although I wasn't like the elderly Qi Ming, who named his study "Bitter Rain" and sat inside sighing all day, I certainly had some thoughts of "hating and deeply resenting it."</p>
<p>However, such things only happen in Shanghai. When I was young and living in my hometown, when the spring rain fell like goose feathers, climbing to the top of the building for a view, the distant mountain scenery was shrouded in a misty rain... the fields in the rain were fresh and serene, making it hard to feel... but what was especially lovely was the nighttime. I don't know which year it was, but one spring, I and two farmhands rowed a small boat to a town ten miles away to see a community play. The performance ended at midnight, and we encountered rain on the way back. The boat moved slowly in the river pond, the lamplight was so dim that faces could not be distinguished, and the hull brushed against the vines and weeds on the riverbank, making a rustling sound. The rain hit the awning, sounding melodious, sometimes slow and sometimes fast, like listening to music, harmonizing with the farmhands' folksongs, "Pushing the awning on a windy and rainy night on the river bridge," truly making one feel transported.</p>
<p>These past few years, I have drifted to the city. Every time it rains, listening to that stagnant, dry sound, and recalling the rainy days of my hometown, I truly feel that even the sound of the rain has changed! The changes in human affairs, needless to say!</p>
<h3 id="e236">Carrot Top <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>

<p>Cat One (Continued)</p>
<p>The blast of the shotgun stunned Carrot Top. He thought the little hut had exploded. After the smoke cleared, he saw the cat at his feet, looking at him with one eye.</p>
<p>Half of the cat's head was blown away, and blood flowed into the milk cup.</p>
<p>"It doesn't look dead," said Carrot Top, "Damn beast, I didn't miss my aim."</p>
<p>He didn't dare move. The cat's one eye emitted a yellow glow, making him uneasy.</p>
<p>As for the cat, seeing that its body was moving, one knew it was still alive, but it didn't seem to want to struggle to move. It seemed to be intentionally dripping blood into the milk cup, and carefully not letting a drop spill outside the cup.</p>
<p>This was not the first time Carrot Top had slaughtered a living thing. He had killed some wild birds, livestock, and a dog for his own amusement or that of others. He knew how to do it. If the creature's life was strong, he had to hurry, get excited, become enraged, and, if necessary, fight it hand-to-hand. Otherwise, we would be invaded by that useless feeling of compassion. We would become timid. We would waste time in vain, ending up with no result at all.</p>
<p>At first, he only inflicted some minor abuse on it. Then he grabbed the cat's tail and beat it on the neck with the butt of the shotgun. He hit it so fiercely that each blow seemed like the last, as if it were the final blow of mercy to let it die sooner. The dying cat grabbed at the air with crazed paws, sometimes shrinking into a ball, sometimes silently relaxing and stretching out.</p>
<p>"Who ever told me that cats cry when they die?" said Carrot Top.</p>
<p>He became anxious. This was taking too long. He threw aside the shotgun, grabbed the cat with both hands, and desperately wanted to sink his fingernails into the cat's flesh. He clenched his teeth, his blood vessels bulging, and strangled it with all his might.</p>
<p>But he himself was getting breathless. He swayed, exhausted, and fell to the ground, sitting, his face touching the cat's face, his eyes staring blankly into the cat's one eye.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>Carrot Top was now asleep on his iron bed.</p>
<p>His family members and people who heard the news and hurried over to his house crowded into the small hut, inspecting the scene where this tragedy had occurred.</p>
<p>"Ah!" his mother said, "I used a hundred times my strength to tear that broken cat from his chest. I can assure you he has never held me so tightly."</p>
<p>As she described to everyone that barbaric impression—this impression that, later, when the family sat and chatted idly in the evening, would be like a fabricated story—Carrot Top was sound asleep, dreaming.</p>
<p>He dreamed that he was walking along a stream, the light of an inevitable bright moon sparkling and crisscrossing in the water, just like the long needles in the hands of a woman weaving something.</p>
<p>On top of the shrimping net, pieces of cat meat were scattered about, shining brightly through the clear water.</p>
<p>Layers of white mist glided across the pasture, perhaps hiding light spirits within.</p>
<p>Carrot Top put his hands behind his back, to prove to them that there was nothing to fear.</p>
<p>A cow approached, stopped, snorted, and then quickly ran away, the sound of its hooves shaking the sky, disappearing in a moment.</p>
<p>How quiet it would be if that talkative stream didn't chatter so much, didn't murmur and mumble, making him uncomfortable like a group of old women gossiping together.</p>
<p>Carrot Top, as if wanting to hit the stream to make it stop talking, gently lifted the pole of the shrimping net, and then many large shrimp surged up from the reeds.</p>
<p>The shrimp kept increasing, upright, shining all over, leaping out of the water.</p>
<p>Carrot Top, overwhelmed by pain, didn't know where to go.</p>
<p>Then many shrimp surrounded him.</p>
<p>They surged toward his throat.</p>
<p>They made some small popping sounds.</p>
<p>They had opened their pincers wide.</p>

<p>Silver and Stocks Rise Together</p>
<h3 id="e237">Financial Bullion Prices Continue to Fall by Three Yuan <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Short Squeeze Still Intense, Once Rising Above Forty Yuan</p>
<p>Recently, the gold market has experienced unpredictable ups and downs, making it difficult for dealers to take action. However, as the overseas silver market has often moved in the opposite direction to the gold market, people have become uncertain. The same was true yesterday. In the morning, with the prices of British and American silver, as well as foreign exchange, American cotton stocks, and other assets rising in unison, the forward price on the Gold Exchange continued to rise by over one tenth. Private telegrams added 1.25, and the gross margin became small. However, due to the overnight decline in silver prices, there were many who sought to close their positions, breaking through the 30 yuan mark. By the time the market opened, the price had returned to above 30 yuan, and as there were no listed prices within the 30 yuan range, people rushed to buy low, and the situation stabilized. After that, price fluctuations were limited. After 11:00 AM, the short squeeze re-emerged, and those with short positions became easily frightened, creating a self-inflicted problem. Dadecheng was the most aggressive in covering short positions, as was the speculator Mr. Yang. The price once rose above 40 yuan. By the time the market closed for the midday break, the price had retreated slightly. In recent days, there have been a large number of short positions, which is why the short squeeze is prone to being triggered. As for rumors of a bullish consortium, these are difficult to prove. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank's daily price fixing continues to squeeze the shorts. How can the bulls influence the price? The bare metal price continues to add 65 yuan, and the price difference between June and July contracts has fallen to 11.5 yuan. Here are the market conditions for the first half of the day:</p>
<p>The market opened in the morning at 930.5 yuan, down 10.3 yuan from the previous closing price. The physical market opened at 1 yuan. Although the foreign exchange market opened strong, with the near-term asking price at 1 shilling 3 pence 1875 and the USD at 25.375 yuan, people felt that the 30 yuan level could not be broken, and rushed to enter the market. Richang was the first to take delivery. Bingxing, Tianfeng, Yongfuchang, and Yuanheng also entered the market. Hengxing had the strongest buying interest. Macali bought September USD at 0625, rising to 5.5 yuan. Before long, this price was difficult to obtain. Shunli, Wupin, Zhifeng, and Yong sold again, at 3.5 yuan, but it remained stable due to Huabi taking delivery of September 125 and Cuitai entering the market. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank listed British at par and USD up 125. During the price fixing, it hovered around 4 yuan. Xiexing, Yonghongli, Yuanheng, and Yuanmao Lai entered the market, rising to 5.8 yuan. As the foreign exchange market stabilized, it was unable to break free from the consolidation. After that, the June USD could be settled at 375, and small accounts were reluctant to sell. Zhifeng and Yong also sold, leading to a gradual decline. Mitsui tried to sell August USD at 375, and September 0625 was difficult to sell. Yuanheng divested, falling to 2 yuan. At this point, the gold market rose again, and the short squeeze intensified. Fuyu, Hengyu, Fuchang, Daxing, Yong, and others rushed to enter the market, and the price was pulled up again. Dadecheng was the most aggressive in buying, reaching 8.8 yuan. Shunli and Wanxing sold at one point, but Dadecheng, Yuanmao, Daxing, Yong, Yuanchun, Qingfa, and Yongzhengchang continued to buy. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank also bought September USD at 26 yuan, and the price jumped to 40.3 yuan. Daxingyong and Hengxing divested at this point, and Yifengyong also sold, retreating to 36 yuan. After that, the foreign exchange market was calm, but buying interest remained strong. Daxingyong entered the market from time to time, while Hengxing, Yuankangxiang sold. After a struggle, the market closed for the midday break at 937.7 yuan, and the physical market was auctioned at 8 yuan. The highest price during the first half of the day was 940.3 yuan, and the lowest was 930.5 yuan, with a fluctuation of 9.3 yuan. As a result, the closing price fell by 3.1 yuan from the previous closing price.</p>
<p>Due to the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank listing USD at 125, totaling 25 yuan, the corresponding gold price was 960 yuan. Based on the closing price, it was approximately 2 yuan, a decrease of about 1 yuan from the previous close. This month's delivery was 951 yuan, and July's was 938 yuan. The morning replenishment was 951 yuan. The bare metal price was calculated at an additional 65 yuan, with a lack of supply. The swap spread for June-July was 35 yuan, with Qianchangxiang lending to Yiyu, and Dadecheng lending 10 at 11.5 yuan. Hengyu also had 7, lent to Dadecheng at the same price. The total number of June contracts was 4,951. The bulls were the largest, with Tongfengheng accounting for over 3,000. Dadecheng had over 900, and Runchangyong had over 400. Runchangyong, Yuanmaoyong had over 100 each. Daxingyong had the most short positions, with over 1,400. Hengxing, Shenkang, Qianchangxiang, and Hengyu all had over 700 short positions.</p>
<p>In the market, demand exceeded supply, and the short squeeze was still intense. Overall, Dadecheng, Daxingyong, Yuanmao, Yuanheng, Xiexing, Yonghongli, Qingfa, Yongfuchang, Zhengchang, Tianfengyong, and Richang entered the market, while Hengxing, Shunli, Wanxing, Zhifengyong, Yuankangxiang, Yuanmaoyong Wupin, and Yifengyong sold. The Dalian gang and the Guangdong gang slightly squeezed out short positions. In the July contract, the bulls still favored the Dalian gang, with Wanxing and Shunli having over 7,000 long positions. In addition, Yuanheng, Fuchang, and Qianchangxiang had around 3,000 each. Yuanshengyong, Hengxing, Runchangyu also had over 600-700 each. Dadecheng had the most short positions, with over 5,500. Ruixing, Yuanchun, Tongfengheng Daxingyong each had thousands of contracts, Yuanmaoyong had over 2,700, and Hongxing, Yiyu, Fuyu, Huixiang, and Huiyuan each had between 600-800 short positions. In total, there were 25,802 contracts.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Weekend Foreign Exchange Market Mediocre <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign telegrams, the London long-term and near-term silver prices both rose by 1875, US silver rose by 75, GBP/USD rose by 1.375, and USD/GBP rose by 1.25, all exceeding 4 yuan. Forward silver prices continued to rise by 1.5 to 2.3. Private telegrams added 125, and American cotton stocks all rose. As a result, the foreign exchange market opened strong, with the near-term selling price estimated at 0625 for GBP and 1875 for USD compared to the previous close. Banks had a good appetite, and both spot trading and arbitrage were busy. The market situation was tight. The Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank listed British at par and USD up 125. The process was stable afterward, hovering around that level. Finally, due to the sharp rise in gold prices, the market followed suit and became tighter. By the time the market closed for the midday break, the selling price was estimated at 1 shilling 3 pence 125 for GBP and 24.25 for USD, with the British market at par and the American market slightly firmer at 625 compared to the previous close. The British exchange transaction in the banking sector was still lackluster, while the American exchange was most actively traded by Zhengjin and Macali. Datong was on the selling side. In addition, there was spot trading. The gold industry occasionally squeezed the market, and the squeeze was slightly tight. The process was mediocre. The half-day transaction record is as follows:</p>
<p>GBP opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 1 shilling 3 pence 1875. Huabi sold to Sassoon 3125 for May. Citibank took delivery of 25 for July and Sumitomo sold to Zhengjin at the same price for August. By the time the market closed for the midday break, the selling price ranged from 1 shilling 3 pence 125 to 25, and the buying price added 0625.</p>
<p>USD opened in the morning with a near-term selling price of 25.375. Huabi and Datong sold to Zhengjin for 7.5625 and 6.4375 for July and June respectively. Macali bought September 0625. Huabi and Macali both took delivery of 125 for the same month. Macali sold to Shanghai. Huabi sold to Zhengjin 625 for July. Dongya bought Dongya 60 and 26 for September. Mitsui tried to sell 875 and buy 26 for September and August respectively. By the time the market closed for the midday break, the selling price was 25.25 for June, 4375 for July, 6875 for August, 9375 for September, and 26.1875 for October. The offering price ranged from 25.3125 to 26.25.</p>
<h3 id="e239">A Sharp Rise of 375 <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency, London, 3rd. Silver prices are soaring. At closing, the near-term price was 19 pence 4375, and the far-term price was 19 and a half pence, which is a rise of 375 compared to the previous day. Also, the GBP/USD exchange rate opened at 4.075.</p>
<h3 id="e240">The Process of Balancing Exchange Rate Premiums and Remittance Premiums <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the market situation has often been characterized by high overseas interest rates, while remittance premiums have been excessively high. If this continues, it will not benefit the market. Financial industry leaders, aware of this trend among their peers, have recognized that this imbalance between foreign exchange and remittances not only distorts the market but also raises concerns from external parties. In reality, these actions by industry players are intended to reduce the hassle of handling and valuing physical silver, sacrificing small profits. This does not affect the market. However, at the twentieth general assembly of the industry, a discussion was held on the imbalance between foreign exchange premiums and remittance premiums, and measures were proposed to rectify the situation. It was resolved that member firms should exchange and settle physical silver coins with each other, and that amounts of 5,000 yuan or more should be personally counted, sealed in boxes, and verified for accuracy. Keys and other petty expenses would be provided by the remitting party. In this way, those who speculate in cash and inflate remittance premiums would lose their leverage, and manipulation would be impossible. As a result, remittance premiums would fall, and foreign exchange premiums would be able to rise freely, pushing up overseas interest rates.</p>
<h3 id="e241">Interest Rates Rise, Remittance Premiums Fall <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>[Saturday: Banks settle transactions simply.]</p>
<p>Yesterday's overseas interest rates were about 5 points higher than the previous day, opening at 8 points, the same in both the morning and afternoon. Remittance premiums, having lost their leverage, fell sharply. Yesterday morning, the market opened at 1.3 yuan, and by the time the market closed, it had fallen by 4-5 points to just 8-9 yuan. Foreign exchange premiums and remittance premiums in the market suddenly averaged out, without any heavy or light disparities. This was due to the effectiveness of the financial industry leaders' rectification efforts. The total volume of interest rate transactions in the morning market was over 4.1 million for transfers and over 1 million for new transactions. The total volume in the afternoon market was over 500,000, and the total volume in the Small General Association was over 700,000. Yesterday's bank settlement messages were simple. Foreign merchants settled over 1 million in bank drafts and over 1.5 million in foreign currency. The settlement of various cargo exchange escrows totaled 3.2-3.3 million in silver and 2.3-2.4 million in foreign currency, with 500,000 in warehouse receipts. Chinese banks settled over 2.3-2.4 million in bank drafts and 6.3 million in settlements. Cargo exchange taxes totaled over 6.3 million, and 300,000 went into the warehouse. Qianzhuang foreign currency public orders settled over 33.3 million. Foreign currency remittance settlement was over 4.3 million, various remittance routes totaled over 700,000, customer orders and withdrawals was 200,000, escrow transactions amounted to over 1.2 million, the amount of banknotes received and issued was over 1.9 million, and cash received by Qianzhuang was over 200,000. Also, the total amount exchanged at the clearinghouse yesterday was 5,200,591.97 yuan, consisting of 2,670,311.14 yuan in silver dollars and 2,532,600.083 yuan in foreign exchange.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Fluctuations in Subsidiary Currency <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan's small silver dollars suddenly rose to 857 yuan in the morning market, a sharp increase of 5-6 yuan compared to the previous day. The price fell back to 854 in the afternoon market, but it was still about 3 yuan higher than the previous afternoon. The transaction volume in the morning market was 9,000 jiao, and in the afternoon market, it was 4,500 jiao. Guangdong's small silver dollars were 779.7 yuan in the morning market and 779.2 yuan in the afternoon market, which was also 1.1 yuan higher than the previous day. The transaction volume in the morning market was 65,000 jiao, and in the afternoon market, it was 30,000 jiao. Copper coins were reduced by 2,000 wen to 316,000 wen, with a transaction volume of over 37,600 strings of wen.</p>
<h3 id="e243">The Cessation of Hostilities Causes a Rush to Cover Short Positions, and All Bonds Achieve New High Prices <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Stock Exchange experienced sudden and unexpected fluctuations. Market covering transactions suddenly arose, as firms scrambled to cover their positions. Large firms bought and the Northern faction also needed them. The supply side was mainly made up of retail investors. Demand far outstripped supply, and the market price began to soar. In the prevailing circumstances, such as the gradual withdrawal of Japanese troops and the unruly actions of Feng Yuxiang's army, which seemed to be irrelevant to the overall situation, morale was boosted. The upward momentum was felt right from the opening bell in the morning. Only the One Nine Bonds and the Twenty Coupons were still lower by 0.05 yuan or 0.15 yuan, as small retailers sold more actively and large firms absorbed the supply. However, once the Salt Tax bond broke the 45 yuan mark, market sentiment grew stronger, and retail investors stopped selling. Market prices rose by several jiao to 1 yuan, and the Disbandment Bond broke the 58 yuan mark. The Salt Tax bond approached 46 yuan, and the situation was very optimistic. At the opening of the afternoon session, the Disbandment Bond broke through the 59 yuan mark. The prices of various bonds in the middle remained relatively stable, and the Salt Tax bond maintained its eagerness to cover shorts, breaking through the 56 yuan mark again. The rising trend did not diminish at all during the closing session, as the Disbandment Bond approached 60 yuan. The distant Salt Tax bond was only 0.05 yuan away from 46 yuan, and continued to rise by several jiao to over 1 yuan. Overall, the rising trend from morning to night did not diminish. Considering the prevailing environment, this phenomenon should not have occurred. However, the large number of outstanding accounts, the realization of the ceasefire, and the sudden rush to cover short positions, coupled with investments and arbitrage transactions in the financial sector, resulted in the prices soaring to new highs for all bonds. The outlook is increasingly optimistic, with a net gain of 0.4-2.0 yuan for each bond. The total volume traded was 14,842,200 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e244">New York Stock Market Continues to Surge <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>Speculative Fever... The Golden Age</p>
<p>According to a report from New Feng Foreign Firm, the New York stock market on Friday (2nd) experienced an even stronger surge, with the most significant price increases reaching as high as nine dollars. Large transactions, ranging from one thousand to seventeen thousand shares, were common. Inside the trading floor, men and women were packed like sardines, and brokers were overwhelmed with calls. The bustling atmosphere was reminiscent of the golden age of speculative frenzy in 1929. The total volume of trading for the day reached 6.88 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 92.21 Up 3.11</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 44.16 Up 0.76</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 32.04 Up 2.46</p>
<p>40 Bonds 84.18 Up 0.56</p>
<h3 id="e245">Yarn and Cotton Flowers: Cotton Yarn's Momentum Weakens <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is trending firm, while the overseas cotton yarn situation is calm. Local sentiment is uniquely strong, and major players continue to absorb stock and consistently buy on dips. However, sellers are still relying on their thick inventory to short sell. However, high cotton prices have led to significant losses for factories, making it difficult for prices to fall at present.</p>
<p>(Small Fluctuations in the Renbiao Market) At the opening of the Renbiao market, the foreign cotton market was calm, and the overall market atmosphere was flat and weak. Around the second and third transactions, the situation suddenly tightened, and buying momentum surged. Prices for each month rose by 5, 7, 8, and 9 jiao. In the afternoon, Yichang increased its selling pressure, putting pressure on the market. Prices softened again at the close, falling by 2 and 4 jiao for each month. The total volume of trading for the day was 53,900 bales. Yichang sold 3,850 bales, Yukang 1,750 bales, Lichang 1,750 bales, Changfeng 1,100 bales, Dachang 2,150 bales, and Taichang 1,350 bales. Yuanda bought 3,850 bales, Changfeng 1,450 bales, Ruida 750 bales, Changji 900 bales, and Renfeng 800 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Renbiao Closing Price Increase/Decrease Inventory Balance September 2034 Up 5 153,100</p>
<p>June 1957 Up 4 35,350 October 2042 7 45,500</p>

<p>August 2015 4 58,500 Total 260,500</p>
<p>(Current Yarn Trend is Still Good) The current yarn turnover is still good. Including yesterday's purchases by various groups, a total of 1,619 bales were bought, and prices rose by 5 jiao. The purchase amounts for each group are listed below:</p>
<p>Wuyuan 55 Sichuan 200 Inland 67 Northern Gang 30 Jiangxi 30</p>
<p>Yunnan 160 Guangdong 730 Southeast Asia 25 Anqing Together 320</p>

<p>The upward trend in the cotton market remains intense due to depleted inventories and high prices in various production areas. Although the foreign cotton situation appears to be stabilizing, it is still difficult for discounted silver shipments to arrive in Shanghai. As a result, speculators are buying heavily to go long, leading to an increasingly tight market atmosphere.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Rises Another Half Yuan) The Zheng Biao market opened relatively flat in the morning. During the second and third transactions, there was a shortage of sellers, and the market suddenly surged. As a result, prices for each month rose by 3, 4, and 5 jiao. The situation remained favorable in the afternoon, with prices rising by 5 fen to 1 jiao for each month. The total volume of trading for the day was 111,200 dan. Yukang sold 50 dan, Yuanda 2,700 dan, Tongxing 3,400 dan, Yuanda 6,600 dan, Ruida 4,200 dan, and Yifeng 2,700 dan. Renfeng bought 3,600 dan, Xincheng 7,200 dan, Shenji 2,300 dan, Mingde 2,500 dan, and Changfeng 4,000 dan. The closing prices are recorded below:</p>

<p>(Current Cotton Mills Pause) The demand for current cotton is relatively sluggish, and factories are not taking much action.</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially fell due to favorable weather, but later strengthened due to the strength of Wall Street. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, while futures rose by up to 12 points per pound. In the Liverpool cotton market, spot prices rose by 9 points, and futures rose by 4 to 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 10 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to Japanese purchases, but later weakened due to speculative selling and profit-taking. As a result, Pingal rose by half a rupee, and Oomra and White Broach each rose by 1 rupee and 2.5 annas. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated June 2nd):</p>

<p>(Liyang High-Quality Cocoon Prices Expected to Rise) New cocoons from the four rural areas of Liyang have been on the market for four or five days. This year's cocoon production is about 60-70% of a normal year. Foreign varieties are considered the best quality. Few cocoon merchants have started weighing, and all are competing to purchase high-quality cocoons. Foreign variety cocoons have already risen to 40 yuan, and local varieties are at 30 yuan. The market outlook is bullish.</p>
<p>(New Cocoons from Dongting Mountain are on the Market) This year's spring cocoons from the east and west mountains of Dongting experienced poor silkworm rearing, but the silkworm season was still good. Cocoon production is only about 50% of normal. New cocoons are on the market. Improved variety, high-quality cocoons initially opened at 40 yuan and have now risen to 55 yuan (Sima Scale). Local variety cocoons are priced between 30 and 37-38 yuan.</p>
<p>(Haining Cocoon Production is Only 30%) Early breeding of local varieties was abandoned due to unfavorable weather conditions. Supplemental breeding of foreign varieties also experienced poor silkworm rearing. Total cocoon production is only about 30%. Foreign variety cocoons are priced between 40 and 45 yuan, and local varieties are priced between 25 and 32 yuan.</p>
<p>(Wuxi Fresh Cocoon Drying Loss is Not Significant) The results of test drying of fresh cocoons collected by various merchants in Wuxi show that the drying loss is not significant. Improved variety cocoons require only 290 jin, and local variety cocoons require 310 jin of fresh cocoons to produce 100 jin of dried cocoons. The average drying loss is only about 300 jin.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales are Difficult to Progress) The silk and silk merchants and silk factories in Shanghai have contracted for 26 boxes of Sanqi, Jinyu, Shijin, and Xiya brand silk for June, priced from 165.25 yuan to 162.75 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Yellow and White Raw Silk Merchants Raise Prices by 10 Yuan) Yesterday, Yokohama Japanese silk prices rose sharply again to 890 yen. New York and Lyon silk prices also rose accordingly. Although current silk transactions in Shanghai are not very smooth, the prices of yellow and white raw silk from silk merchants have already risen by 10 yuan. Linas and others imported 100 bales of white raw silk from Shanghai, 115 bales of Sichuan yellow raw silk, and 22 bales of coarse yellow silk.</p>

<p>丨 Shexian Zhenmei Also Opens丨</p>
<p>Since the arrival of new goods of Tunxi Zhenmei green tea in Shanghai, the market has been... Zhenmei, although there have been telegrams defining the price months before, the merchants lacked persistence and had no choice but to take advantage of the opportunity. Yesterday, Jinjiang Foreign Firm took the lead in large-scale sales, and Yihe, Yichang and Zhou Fuhua Tea and other companies also began... Regarding Tunxi, the amount of transactions was no less than two thousand boxes. Wuyuan East Road Zhenmei and Shexian Zhenmei also opened one after another. Wuyuan sold Zhenmei for 205 yuan, ordinary batches of goods for 160 yuan, and Shexian Zhenmei for 112 yuan. Tunxi was reduced from 170 yuan to 125 yuan. Although the Zhenmei tea trade in the entire city was very strong, the sales volume was no longer the same as before. As for Qining and other black tea, yesterday only Yihe and Tianyu and other companies had slightly more purchases, and the market situation was still bleak.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Grain and Rice Stability in Lower Reaches of the River is Very High <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) The source is from 30 to 40 companies, and the destination is sluggish and the stomach is active. The intake on this street was flat from the start to the close of the market. The goods purchased were all the regular Bang Su Tong Geng rice from the lower reaches of the river, as well as Nan Gang Hou Hang boats of thin rice Fengjing and other old thin rice. The market situation remains stable. The opening of the market was immediately upbeat, and the situation was unusually tight. Tianjin, Weihaiwei and other groups purchased nearly 4,000 packages of thin rice and thick japonica rice. The majority were thin rice, and Songjiang goods accounted for the majority, totaling more than 2,000 packages. The price opened at 7 yuan, 4 jiao and 5 fen to 05 fen. Qingjiao Si Xin Xi Shu goods were 1,000 packages. The opening price was 7 yuan, 8 jiao to 6 jiao and 5 fen for Qingjiao special goods, 7 yuan, 4 jiao and 3 fen for rushed special goods, 7 yuan, 3 jiao and 7 fen for general goods, 7 yuan, 5 jiao and 8 fen for Sijing rushed special goods, 7 yuan, 4 jiao and 8 fen for Xinzhen rushed special goods, 7 yuan for Xitang, and 6 yuan and 9 jiao and 6 yuan and 8 jiao for Shuitang. Tongli stacked goods of Qingpi Hou Geng were 4 to 500 packages, and the opening price was 7 yuan, 4 jiao to 3 jiao and 5 fen. According to statistics, the market price rose by several fen or jiao or more. Thanks to the peaceful resolution of the Beiyang situation, people's minds were stable, and the purchasing gangs were actively buying. The stomachs of foreign pointed rice were lacking in goods and fragrant. The premium was half a jiao, while Dujian rice felt normal and without honor or disgrace. The price of Yuan special goods was good. The middle class were still in a stable situation.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There are more than 20 sources of goods from the lower reaches of the river. The early market for white japonica rice was sluggish, and the transaction continued to improve in the afternoon market, resulting in a stable market. There were continuous arrivals of thin rice with a slightly different appetite, and the price was sluggish at 5 to 6 yuan. Sheep Du Butian arrived in moderate quantities, and the price was stable. The price of Kejian Ping was flat, and the price of Yinbian Yuan had little fluctuation.</p>
<h3 id="e252">North Ocean Gang Buys Recent Flour <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>After the opening of the flour market yesterday, the prices of each month rose steadily. Although there was a period of softness in the middle, the results were still good. This was because the Beiyang Gang believed that the Northern Peace had been completed, and the needs of various regions were gradually increasing. In addition, the water fee was reduced by 70%, so they took the opportunity to buy recent shipments for distribution to the northern market. Tianjin's appetite was more active, and other gangs also inquired about prices. Local hoarders and non-industry longs also paid attention to distant months. Therefore, market prices rose. However, major factories sold recent shipments, and small factories sold distant months. However, due to demand exceeding supply, market prices still rose. The closing price was up 1.5 fen for this month, 1.75 fen for July, 1 fen for August, 1.25 fen for September, 1.5 fen for October, and 2 fen for November.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Distant Month Wheat Merchants and Factories Replenish <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw a small number of spot arrivals. As new wheat samples have been seen in various regions, the listing of new goods is approaching. In addition, a small number of new wheat has already entered the market in various production areas, and the arrival of goods in Shanghai is not far away. Therefore, people's minds are weak. This month's contracts immediately fell by 3 fen. Distant month contracts initially showed signs of weakness, but due to the movement of flour, merchants and factories replenished, and outside customers inquired. Therefore, the market reversed and rose steadily. The closing price was up 3 fen for July, 2 fen for August, and 3 fen for September.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Minhang Green Broad Beans on the Market <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the first batch of new green broad beans from Minhang arrived with more than 300 packages. The grains were still complete, but the quality was slightly soft. Shantou Gang purchased 150 packages at a price of 4 yuan and 2 jiao. The remaining half were purchased by merchants on this street. Continued arrivals of 53 packages of Ningbo white broad beans were still accepted by the Tianjin Gang at the original price. Yesterday's 1,000 packages of Wenzhou beans were all sold to foreign companies. The price for large grains opened at 4 yuan, 6 jiao to 4 jiao and 9 fen, and small grains opened at 4 yuan, 5 jiao to 4 jiao and 2 fen, a decrease of 4 to 5 jiao compared to the selling price of the first batch.</p>

<p>丨 Middle Sand White Drops Two Jiao 丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market turned down due to weak mark gold and slightly longer Dutch exchange rates. At the association's listing, 100 packages of ordinary grade 24 coarse sand white were listed at 20 yuan and 2 jiao and 8 fen, a decrease of 7 fen compared to the previous listing. Only 30 packages of No. 20 middle sand white were listed at 19 yuan and a half, a decrease of 2 jiao compared to the previous listing. No transactions were made for No. 8 and 9 Dutch red at 16 yuan and 2 jiao. Zhenji Factory opened at 19 yuan and 9 jiao for No. 1 cotton white, 19 yuan and 7 jiao for No. 2, 19 yuan and 5 jiao for No. 3, 19 yuan and 3 jiao for No. 4, and 19 yuan and 1 jiao for No. 5. Two to three hundred packages of Hainan red were offered, with the higher ones at 13 yuan and 7 jiao and 2 fen, and the next highest at 13 yuan and 5 jiao and a half.</p>

<p>The white tung oil sales market is at its peak season. After the holiday, various places want to prepare inventory, and domestic sales are active. Hanshang foreign firms also continue to actively handle transactions. The wholesale price has increased from 16 yuan and 8 jiao per dan to 18 yuan and 5 jiao. The strength of the rising trend was initially impressive. However, after this surge, buyers seem to have restrained themselves slightly. Yesterday, according to a telegram from Han, the purchase price of Zhizhi tung oil opened by merchants has increased to 19 yuan and 3 jiao, and the selling price among merchants is still between 18 yuan and 5 jiao and 6 jiao. Even if it increases further, it will be limited. It is said that Zhejiang tung oil has also been driven by the Hanfeng and its momentum is also strong. Hanghang still intends to sell each chu at 24 yuan. The high price has led to sluggish sales, so it is proposed to change it to 23 yuan and 8 jiao. Although it is unknown whether it is accurate, it is inevitable.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Cloth Market: Decline in Serge Sales <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Serge is a popular product due to the brisk sales of plain colors, which have transactions in both winter and summer. Initially, serge was imported from British, German, and American goods. Since French merchants have been transporting and selling it, the aforementioned goods have been hit hard because French serge is cheaper. However, since the brisk sales of Chinese goods, the sales of foreign goods have also declined sharply. Retailers of plain serge mostly purchase the No. 918 and Liuhe brands from Zhanghua and other domestic products. Yesterday, the domestic Zhanghua No. 918 serge opened at 3 yuan and 2 jiao and a half per yard in foreign currency.</p>

<p>As the tea market has plummeted, the sales of white lead sheet have also been greatly affected. The arrival of goods in this port has been surging, and the rich inventory is enough to supply a year's needs. Moreover, the business of military factories and cigarette factories is also limited. Because of this, there is a general impression of being in decline. It is currently estimated at 35 yuan per dan, but the market is still negotiable for confirmed businesses and large transactions. Other colors, such as No. 5, No. 9, and No. 10, can all be estimated at 35 yuan in the current market, an increase of one or two yuan compared to previously.</p>

<p>Slum Life Special Issue (Part 1) Amateur Musings</p>
<h3 id="e259">"Impoverishing the Non-Poor" and "Leveling the Uneven" <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Pu</p>
<p>Before our dear readers look at the contents of this special issue, we should first explain the motivation and hope for publishing the Slum Life Special Issue.</p>
<p>We recently felt that in the political and social issues we have discussed in the past, we seemed to have overlooked the most difficult and important problem facing China today: the poverty of the poor. We have no way to obtain accurate statistical figures, but the number of so-called "poor people" in Shanghai and, by extension, throughout China is, at the very least, based only on what we can hear and see, and we cannot deny that their number has exceeded the majority of the entire Chinese people. We deeply feel that this phenomenon is the biggest "internal" national crisis in China today. This kind of national crisis is not as urgent on the surface as those "external," easily arousing the attention of the people of the country and the international community, but its latent danger is precisely the main cause of internal and external troubles, especially the loss of cities and territories in the past two years. Seeing the current trend, the scope of this number of poor people will only increase, and at the same time, the government and the majority of the non-poor people in the country, in addition to following customs and doing a little charitable or quasi-charitable passive relief, almost no one pays attention to the fundamental work of improvement. Regarding this point, we should pay special attention to the government, because the major policies to improve the suffering of the people are not something that a few private individuals can do, and the use of government power is necessary to achieve results. However, examining all the work of the government in the past, there is too little progress towards this goal. The government has all kinds of unavoidable difficulties in dealing with external national crises, which are easy to gain people's understanding, but the government's fundamental work to improve the suffering of the people can also be said to be the most important responsibility the government bears to the people, and we have not seen the government have any determination to save the plan and implementation, which is really incomprehensible to us. Some people may say; "The government is currently focusing on suppressing the Communists, and only after the Communists are suppressed can all relief problems be carried out." It is not something we dare to oppose, but we hope that the government should pay the same attention to the work of improving the lives of the poor, and implement it with the same determination. If not, then I am afraid that by the time the Communists are suppressed, the country will soon be over. Will it not fundamentally lose the government's original intention of suppressing the Communists today?</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said a most concise and appropriate sentence. He said, "The only purpose we hold is to level the uneven and make the uneven level." We see now how many "level the uneven" work the government has done. Even those in the government cannot deny that this fact is evolving in the opposite direction. To explain it in the simplest terms, it is not "leveling the uneven," but "impoverishing the non-poor and making the non-poor poor." The greatest motivation and hope for us to publish this Slum Life Special Issue is that we deeply feel that the increasing expansion of the scope of the poor is the fundamental internal danger of our country and nation. We should loudly appeal to expose the suffering of the poor as much as possible, hoping to prompt the government and a group of non-poor people to pay attention, so that everyone knows how to urgently seek ways to save the tragic situation of the poor. We firmly believe that no matter what kind of political system the government is under, if it does not pay attention to the "poor people's" problem, this government will collapse and will not last long!</p>

<p>— Yi Qing</p>
<p>Slums on Robison Road</p>
<p>Walking past the Big Ben on Xiaoshadu Road, continuing west, the houses on both sides of the road gradually, gradually became gray, sloping, low, and narrow. Black tiles, brown walls, and decaying fixtures, everything presents fatigue and death. There are no neat street trees, no beautiful decorations, no tempting music, no shining red lanterns, and no lively and healthy girls, the light of diamonds, the fragrance of powder. Here, there are only dilapidated shops, weak colors, the groans of hunger and cold, the miserable cries of disease, dilapidated roads, thin and gray-black people, and the stench of sweat and flesh. Robison Road is just like that, forever and ever, gasping for breath, half-awake and not asleep.</p>
<p>The famous Yinghua Lane is located not far from Xiaoshadu Road. Its honeycomb-like body occupies both sides of the road. Countless, cell-by-cell houses are filled with many suffering people wriggling. Although their spirits are so tired and their faces are so pale, they are still constantly working, constantly struggling, constantly sweating, and constantly gasping for breath. Indescribable tattered and ruined things are piled all over the ground; human breath, smoke, and stench are exchanged, stirring up the entire space, occupying it, suffocating everyone's breathing, it is just like a large pile of rotten melons, with countless flies and mosquitoes buzzing on it, and it is like a small pool full of sewage, with many larvae floating in the pool. However, it is the gathering area for the masses here, it is the essence of Robison Road!</p>
<p>Crossing Yinghua Lane, irregularly interspersed between the sparse houses are undulating wastelands. On the wasteland, in addition to the original graves and rubble and decaying grass, some people have borrowed a corner of it as a place to live, and some people have borrowed a small piece of it as a resting place for the bones of those who died without a home. So these useless gaps are the heavenly kingdom where the living and the dead who stay here can settle down.</p>
<p>On the smooth road paved with asphalt, cars, trams, carts, and wheelbarrows pass by from time to time. Dust and shouts pass by in bursts, but they can never bring back a trace of lively enthusiasm. The street lights accompany the streets, lying coldly in the silvery-gray light. Without the wailing of the whistle, there is no turbulence of the crowd. Here</p>

<p>life is completely controlled by a few large chimneys in the throat, and they cannot be liberated every day and every hour.</p>
<p>Caojiadu at the end of Robison Road is a poor market, composed of all kinds of poor things. Hawkers' stalls are displayed on both sides of the road, one after another. Whether it is morning or evening, there are withered yellow vegetables, dead fresh fish, foul-smelling salted mandarin fish, bloody pig heads and cow bodies, and many things that can be put into the garbage dump for sale. Muddy water covers the ground, and there is no dry season even under the intense sunlight. There is no so-called hygiene here. Who knows that Robison Road has such a flavor丨And who can deeply understand the taste here丨She is the vitality of urban prosperity, she is the hell under the feet of heaven. However, when will the light of the sun shine all over the earth and come to this place?</p>

<h3 id="e262">How to Relieve the Plight of the Poor Caused by the Decline in the Value of Copper Coins <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Proposed by Councilor Wan Qiuqun</p>
<p>(Copper Coins and Slums) Obviously, mansions and copper coins don't have much to do with each other. This is because the people living in mansions need commodities that humble copper coins cannot fulfill. In other words, the things they need are expensive and require silver to purchase. Therefore, they deal with silver and have little to do with copper coins. Conversely, our friends living in slums are closely related to copper coins. They mostly deal with copper coins, so the decline in the value of copper coins affects their lives and makes it harder for them to survive.</p>
<p>Currency is essentially a commodity. It contains a certain amount of labor. Its price decrease invariably leads to price increases of goods. Its price increase invariably leads to price decreases of goods.</p>
<p>Not many months ago, the price of copper coins was about 2,500 cash per yuan. Recently, one yuan can be exchanged for about 3,200 cash. This means that one copper coin now is only worth about 78% of what it was worth at its highest point. In other words, one hundred cash now is worth a little less than eighty cash at its highest point, essentially a 20% discount across the board. Therefore, the prices of many things have increased when calculated in copper coins, and friends in the slums who use copper coins are the first to suffer.</p>
<p>In the slums, no one suffers from the woes of copper coins more than ordinary rickshaw pullers, laborers, and peddlers. They cannot raise their fares by two copper coins because of the decline in the value of copper coins. A day's odd job still pays three or four dimes. Ham dumplings still cost twelve copper coins, and fried rice cakes are still three copper coins. Thus, the compensation for their labor and their income are effectively discounted by 20%.</p>
<p>With income reduced by 20% and suffering a 20% loss on spending due to the decline in the value of copper coins, life becomes even more difficult under this double discount. This is "unimaginable" to the young masters and misses in the mansions!</p>
<p>So, how to provide relief? That is a matter for discussion among the readers of this publication!</p>
<h3 id="e263">Such a Family! <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Zhi</p>
<p>(Hut) Not far from a factory, there is a low-lying and damp open space, which can also be described as an open public pit. On this dirty open space, a small hut was built. This hut is truly pitifully small, with a length and width of only six or seven feet. The roof and the surrounding walls are all patched together with rags, bamboo, wood, straw, and rusty pieces of tinplate. Most of the materials come from "garbage bins." Because of the complexity of the materials, the technical difficulties are imaginable. Especially to avoid wind and rain, thick straw ropes must be used to intricately tie the entire house, like an added decoration.</p>
<p>The hut has a door facing the road, shaped like an upright egg, which is too short. Except for children, one must stoop to enter. Fortunately, the adults living inside have already become hunched!</p>
<p>Although there are no windows, there are many cracks in the surrounding walls, which not only allow some sunlight to penetrate but also allow rain to enter.</p>
<p>The people in the hut include a couple and two children, the older one being eight or nine years old and the younger one being two or three years old. The elderly couple is around forty or fifty years old.</p>
<p>The head of the family has an injured left eye, which is tightly wrapped with a piece of medicated cotton. His back is severely bent, and he coughs incessantly, even spitting out a mouthful of thick green phlegm. He often paces back and forth in front of his pitiful hut, as if he is filled with thoughts. His wife has a bundle of withered and disheveled hair – with absolutely nothing in common with the dishevelment of modern girls – covering her forehead and the back of her neck. Her face is even more terribly yellow and black, which is clearly a sign of enduring the hardships of life and malnutrition. She has no expression. No trace of sorrow or joy can be found. It is simply a rigid face. The two children are just two skinny monkeys, but definitely not as agile as monkeys.</p>
<p>Their clothes are exactly what is called "hundred-family clothes," just like the hut they live in, purely patched together with fabrics of all kinds. Especially the housewife's uneven-edged coat, which is only knee-length, just like the short cheongsams that were popular in Shanghai two years ago. She wears a pair of shoes with two different styles. Among the whole family, wearing shoes is her exclusive right.</p>
<p>Let's take a look inside their hut. It is simply a pigsty. On the ground in the western corner, there is a straw mat made of something like salt bags. In the pile of tattered cotton, there is a faint tremor, and at the same time, a broken and continuous wailing can be heard. It turns out that there is a living thing lying inside!</p>
<p>The south side of the hut serves as the kitchen. There is a stove made of a half-moon-shaped broken jar. In addition, there are scattered bowls and chopsticks. On the north side, some tools for making a living are hung, such as a plasterer's brush and a large manure basket for picking up garbage.</p>
<p>When it doesn't rain, they can cook outside. Do they have rice to eat? In a big pot, they boil the large leaves of amaranth – these large leaves are originally used to feed pigs, and in ordinary vegetable fields, we can see piles of them discarded like tombs – occasionally a few snow-white noodles float up from the turbulent boiling water, with only a trace of salt added. Oil is said to be off the agenda.</p>
<p>Their food is cooked, and they all sit on the ground to eat. Although there are only four people, there are bowls and chopsticks of all shapes and sizes! There is a cigarette holder, and a half-moon-shaped bowl. Taking advantage of their meal, I started chatting with the head of the family.</p>
<p>"Where are you from?" I asked him with sympathy and sincerity.</p>
<p>"Alas, sir!" He said with a mixture of sadness in his kind face, "I am originally from Shandong, but in order to escape the heavy burden of excessive taxes and levies, I had to leave my hometown almost eight years ago."</p>
<p>"What do you do?" I hesitated first, afraid of making him sad, but finally mustered the courage to say it. "What do I do?" He hastily swallowed a mouthful of food and replied, "Alas, sir! Now, you could say that I have a job, but I don't have a job; you could say that I don't have a job, but I do. I do a small job of painting walls. I rarely get a chance to do it a few times a month. The survival of my family of four depends entirely on me. My survival depends on luck!"</p>
<p>"How long have you lived here?" I continued to ask him.</p>
<p>"Sir! Let me tell you in detail," he had already forgotten to eat, his dim eyes shining with a soft light, staring at me, and said, "In the autumn of the year before last, I moved from Pudong to Zhabei, borrowing a hut that was much larger than this to live in. Although business was very bad at that time, I still hoped that it might get better in winter because in winter, many people have to brush their houses and prepare for the new year. Unexpectedly, later, the Japanese planes blew up our hut into powder. Fortunately, we managed to save our four lives and suffer here!" After saying these words, he stopped eating. He took out a bucket, turned it upside down, put a piece of clothing on it, and hurriedly asked me to sit down while still talking to me in depth.</p>
<p>"I used to work as a stevedore in Pudong, and I could only earn one or two dimes a month. We have lived like this for several years. But later, life became even more difficult. Until the year before last, there were more and more stevedores every day, and I was also a person without connections; at the same time, I was old, and I couldn't do the work on the wharf anymore! Therefore, I was kicked out! I have no way now, I can only wait for death! But I still hope that my two sons will grow up in the future, and maybe they can vent our grievances for us poor people!"</p>
<p>After he finished these words, he seemed even more depressed. His gaze had turned to the two children who were not wearing a stitch of clothing. I saw that he was too sad, so I took the opportunity to leave.</p>

<p>(Sampan) The lives of Shanghai people are truly diverse. The rich have the lives of the rich, and the poor have the lives of the poor. No matter what, they cannot be drawn onto the same line of life. Among the poor, there is an even poorer way of life, and that is the life in the sampans.</p>
<p>A sampan is a type of boat without a deckhouse. In the current situation of rural bankruptcy and an increasingly severe urban economic crisis, the sampan industry is bound to be in decline. Therefore, the life of a family in a sampan cannot be sustained by the stinky water in the river, and they must each find a way out. Men can only pull rickshaws, and women go to work in factories. But the life of pulling a rickshaw or working in a factory may not be satisfactory. Although there are many houses in Shanghai, they are enjoyed by the rich. Although the sampans are small, they are still useful for sheltering from the wind and rain.</p>
<p>Therefore, in every river in western Shanghai, there are many people who use sampans as their homes. Their houses rise and fall with the tides of the river. If the bottom of the boat has been around for a long time and cannot withstand the water seeping in, it can also be dragged to the bank and placed aground. Living in it is still not a problem, but it cannot be moved.</p>
<p>The inside of the boat, needless to say, is extremely cramped. During the day, a broken reed mat is removed from the side of the boat, allowing us to see the interior. Looking closely, we can see a pair of well-arranged chopsticks, a chipped oil pot, a broken soy sauce bottle, and a spatula with a broken handle. In short, the cooking utensils are all available, but they are just a little tattered. The belly of the boat is full of mud-stained straw and carrots. On the bow of the boat, two piglets are circled with bamboo strips, along with chamber pots, rags, tin foil, cigarette shells, cans of Le Tu Jing, high-heeled shoes with broken heels, and diapers, etc., all piled up haphazardly.</p>
<p>Some people also dislike the boat being too narrow, so they remove the original mat awning and piece together some lead sheets and wooden boards to build it like a house. This is a more aristocratic type of sampan, and it is also the result of their willingness to work. Because there are plenty of old goods at the junkyards, as long as you pay a little price. The source of this price is labor. Otherwise, if you are willing to rummage through more garbage cans, you can get them the same way.</p>
<p>However, there is one thing to worry about. When the early tide comes, you can't oversleep. Otherwise, other boat dwellers will wake you up and scold you because your boat is not being taken care of. If it leaves the dock, it will crush other people's awnings. If a sudden rainstorm comes, you must quickly set up the mat awning. Otherwise, if the rain gets into the cabin, you will have to sleep on the damp boards at night. When the wind rises, it is time to rock the boat. The whole family does not dare to leave, fearing that the cable will loosen and the boat will drift away. Therefore, living in a sampan is definitely not as quiet as living in a grass shed. It is also the poorest people who live in sampans.</p>

<p>— Lv</p>
<p>(Workshop) Usually, when it gets hot, after work, most of the people in the workshop come to the alley to cool off. The older ones sit next to people and talk about how difficult it is to live in the world nowadays. Sometimes, when they get excited, they will also talk about the survival of China and the history of participating in the May 30th General Strike. The young male workers, besides talking to their partners about how hateful the rice buckets in the factory are and how the lackeys rely on their power to bully others, always talk about women. Some go to the young girls, waiting for a chance to chat with them. The child laborers are good at playing cards and rolling copper coins. The four- or five-year-old children, despite not knowing what is good or bad, play all day long. Their mothers are busy all day long sewing clothes, cooking, and washing clothes. In addition, there are a few people who run around everywhere after work and will not come back until night.</p>
<p>The stench from the garbage pile in the corner of the alley and the dampness from the houses, plus the sweat from the people, make the entire workshop a turbid mess.</p>
<p>But today, something seems unusual in the workshop. There is not the usual noise, and there are not as many people in the alley as usual. But there are many sighs coming from various rooms. Only the children are still playing as usual. The guys who usually run around everywhere after work are not running around today. Everyone is sitting at Geng Sheng's – one of them – house.</p>
<p>"Lao Sun told me about that," Lao Li, a tall man with dark skin, looked at the partners around him and said, "He said that three days ago, weren't three cars full of cotton yarn driven in from outside when we were eating? The cars stopped at the warehouse gate, and then someone carried the bales of yarn inside. Zhang XX from the factory was standing next to the car, and a guy who looked like a Japanese, acting suspiciously, not knowing what they were talking about. Someone went to ask what was going on, and they replied that it was transported from the old factory. But Lao Sun didn't quite believe it. He stole a gap and went outside for a walk, and then quietly told everyone that the yarn was transported from a Japanese yarn factory in XX Du. At that time, everyone was a little confused. Today, the capitalist announced that the cotton yarn business was not good and that wages would be reduced. I realized what was going on."</p>
<p>Everyone was a little indignant when they heard this.</p>
<p>"Just now, Xiao Liu from the fine yarn workshop told me when he was off work, let's tell the people in the workshop and the people living here about this matter. We want everyone to stand up and oppose the wage reduction," Lao Li took a sip of tea and said again.</p>
<p>That night, the entire workshop was different from the silent atmosphere when they came back from work today, and also different from the usual atmosphere. It was in an unusually tense atmosphere.</p>

<p>— Ms. Lv</p>
<p>(Pigeon Coop Houses) In a pigeon coop house, there are two small-footed women working the night shift in the tobacco factory in the front building. On top of the front building is a young man who coughs every night, making it impossible for people to sleep. He is only twenty-five or six years old, but he is as thin as a skeleton. The landlord lives in the living room, and above the living room is a low cage called the attic, where I live. The alcove room is occupied by a couple who have just come from the countryside, who are said to be looking for work, but they have been living there for several months. As for who lives in the kitchen, I have not seen them for several months, nor do I have the time to inquire. This is life in the cage:</p>
<p>The landlord doesn't know what he does, and he is rarely seen. The woman plays mahjong at home all day, usually until after one o'clock in the night before she stops, which is especially distressing for me, who has to go to the factory during the day. Sometimes, I am very angry and want to scold her, but I finally endure it. Compared to her, she is still not as hateful as our foreman. Our foreman is really a fierce god! Being late is punished with beatings and scolding and fines, and being slow is also punished with beatings and scolding and fines. Sometimes I have such thoughts in my heart: "Bring a knife and chop down from the top of that foreman's head," as if that would relieve my anger. But I know that even if I kill her alone, it won't work, because there are more foremen oppressing us. If one dies, there will be a second one to come. Therefore, unless we, the oppressed people, unite to resist them, individual resistance will have no result.</p>
<p>The couple in the alcove room is really inexplicable. Sometimes I hear them laughing loudly, sometimes I hear the man scolding, and sometimes I hear the woman shouting for death. Cups and bowls sometimes fly out of the window, and glass is sometimes shattered. The landlady scolds and wails, but immediately disappears without a trace. The quarreling stops, and the crying stops. It's really strange, why is life between the two sexes so incompatible!</p>
<p>Speaking of myself, I have to get up before dawn to go to the factory in the morning. I hurriedly cook a little rice, and the vegetables were bought the night before, perhaps dried radish or pickles. I carry my lunch basket and run, not waiting for the factory to ring the bell, and must rush to get there. Once I go in, I am released only after twelve hours. When I get home, I am almost like a half-dead person, and I eat something casually and fall on the bed to sleep. I am doing this as a slave to the machine, and I don't know when I can get a rest! The two small-footed women in the front building are rarely seen two or three times a month. When they come back, I go out, and when I come back, they go out. Only on the road can we occasionally meet. One is said to be the sister-in-law, whose brother was washed away when there was a big flood; the other is the younger sister, about seventeen or eighteen years old, but she is black and thin. The wages they earn, in addition to sending some to the grandmother at home, also have to send three yuan a month to the introducer. They themselves have nothing left.</p>
<p>The young man in the attic above has recently lost his job. He used to work in the XX Iron Factory. I'm not very clear about the rest, but I occasionally wake up in the middle of the night and hear the landlady talking about him in the "pong, east wind" mahjong game. It seems that he has already owed two months' rent.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Humble Lives <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Yi Shan</p>
<p>(Under the Eaves and Under the Staircase in the Alley) I live in a wharf area. Because it is close to the wharf and has many bathhouses, pancake shops, and a small vegetable market, it has become a gathering place for wharf laborers. If you pass through this place, you will see workers of all shapes and sizes everywhere with rotten eyes, crooked noses, and swollen red faces. In the morning, evening, and on holidays, the streets and alleys are filled with them. Not to mention cars and rickshaws, even people walking by have to push left and dodge right, making many detours to pass through.</p>
<p>These laborers all have no homes. During the day, they sell all their labor at the wharf. When they come back in the evening, they randomly fill their stomachs and then lie down under the eaves on both sides of the road and under the staircases in the alley to sleep. In rainy weather, they endure the light rain, and in heavy rain, they sit and sleep in the crowded staircases in the alley or other places that can provide some shelter. The price of their hard work all day cannot afford them to stay in a small inn. In fact, they are lucky if they can avoid starvation. All year round, from spring to summer, from autumn to winter, in the cycle of the four seasons, they stiffly drag their humble lives. At most, they spend three or four copper coins to buy a bowl of alcohol-laced water to stimulate their numb nerves. Some who cannot afford opium spend ten copper coins to buy opium residue water, which is boiled with the residue of opium dregs that have been cooked into opium paste. It is even more blood-sucking and bone-gnawing than opium. Those laborers who eat pancakes and steamed buns and have no fat in their stomachs become addicts in just four or five days and soon become active mummies.</p>
<p>Although they work hard all year round, they eat pancakes, steamed buns, or rotten fish and meat, and sleep in the streets and alleys. No matter how strong their bodies are, their lives cannot last long, especially since they are also having their vitality sapped by alcohol and opium residue water. Therefore, I often see laborers lying down and groaning painfully by the dirty small roads or in the damp and smelly alleys. Then, the next day or four or five days later, they lie straight and won't move until the police discover them and send someone to carry them to some unknown place. And those animals of the same kind who are still alive, they are still working, drinking alcohol, drinking opium residue water, living numbly and despairingly, waiting until one day they also lie down and won't wake up.</p>

<p>— Long Yi</p>
<p>Attic</p>
<p>I am twenty-four years old. At the age of sixteen, I left my remote and distant hometown to advance towards this vast world and open the door to life. For seven or eight years, I have traveled all over the north and south of the Yangtze River, the three Xiang and seven Ze, and the Han, Luo, You, and Yan regions. I am pursuing, pursuing, and pursuing the future I yearn for.</p>
<p>Life seems to expand forward like the ripples caused by a stone thrown into the calm water, but gradually it contracts inward. This band of life binds me tightly, like being sealed in a can. But I still want to struggle and break through this solid wall.</p>
<p>In this big city, the rich are fascinated by their greedy eyes, the young masters and misses are dancing their delicate and amorous eyebrows, the merchants are holding their iron-faced and ruthless abacuses, and my young friends, like me, are vying for opportunities in the streets, like playing hide-and-seek to find a piece of bread to fill their stomachs. I, too, am struggling on this line of hunger like them. Today, I can still take refuge in the attic of a poor friend. Tomorrow, we will be thrown into the streets, deprived of any support.</p>
<p>Although I have no specialized skills, I have gained some experience in life and developed some abilities to cope with the world in the seven or eight years that I have been finding my own bread. In the past, I have worked as a secretary, copyist, proofreader, editor, teacher, and civil servant. Now, in addition to being able to do the above work, I also want to do other work. I am even willing to be an industrial worker, because I don't want my life to remain permanently in the atmosphere of intellectuals. My requirements for life are very low. Forgive me for not pricing myself in advance. If employed, I will be deeply grateful. Please forward replies through this publication. I am waiting with an empty stomach.</p>

<p>— Xiao Tang</p>
<p>(???) It was a deep evening, just before the end of spring, around one o'clock. The cold, crisp, and desolate wind wandered alone through the once-bustling avenue. I followed this wandering wind and walked onto the north end of the Sichuan Road Bridge. Under the south end of the bridge, wriggling black shadows were visible, trembling in the clear, cold electric light. At a glance, I knew they were three so-called "little three" types, taking advantage of the night to ply their "taxi-hailing" trade. A sense of curiosity – really, it was boredom – gradually drew me closer to them. I bravely began the first words of "conversation" with them, imitating the tone of a "tycoon."</p>
<p>"How much money can you earn each day pulling rickshaws like this?"</p>
<p>"It's hard to say. On a good day, we might make one or two thousand cash, but on a bad day, we barely make a hundred or two." One of them, about fifteen or sixteen years old, hesitated, glancing at me a few times before slowly answering. "Oh, we have to hand in five hundred cash every day!" A child of about ten years old, with not a trace of color in his face, innocently and frankly blurted out.</p>
<p>"What, you have to hand in money? To whom?" I asked in genuine surprise.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Of course, we have to hand in money, to 'Uncle'! We have to hand in five hundred cash every day!" the child replied again.</p>
<p>I was then sadly convinced that their handing in money was not a fabrication, because I knew at least something about Shanghai, and I knew that "Uncle" was one of the famous figures in Shanghai.</p>
<p>"So, after handing in the five hundred cash, do you have any money left? And what happens when you have a bad day?"</p>
<p>"'Uncle' doesn't care if we have a bad day. All 'Uncle' cares about is that we hand in the five hundred cash every day. We all have an 'Uncle.' I've sworn allegiance to my 'Uncle,' and those two have their 'Uncles' too. How can you 'hustle business' without swearing allegiance to 'Uncle'? Would you dare come here if 'Uncle' didn't agree? " The child said in a string, and excitedly continued, "We have to hand in five hundred cash every day. If you can't hand in five hundred cash today, 'Uncle' will beat you to death! Oh! Mommy! 'Uncle' beats so hard it's life-threatening!" As he spoke, the child pulled up the cuff of his right trouser leg and continued, "Look! Look! Mother X. The welts on my body hurt so much I cried for help, and they're still tingling. Alas, alas, 'Uncle' beats so hard it's life-threatening. He locks you up alone and beats you with whatever he can grab. Who's going to come and talk him out of it?" The child tried to pull his trouser leg up, but it was too small, too tight, and he was afraid of tearing it, so he just held it at the bend of his knee. He involuntarily rubbed his buttocks and the back of his thigh repeatedly.</p>
<p>The older one interjected, "We have to hand over all the money we get to 'Uncle.' If he finds any hidden money, it's another disaster. The clothes 'Uncle' occasionally gives us are just like the dirty old clothes we're wearing." He looked at me with pitiful eyes. The oldest one never answered me a single word, just sizing me up with triangular eyes.</p>
<p>"So, how did you end up in such a destitute situation? Do you pull rickshaws on the bridge every night? Do you sleep at 'Uncle's' house?"</p>
<p>The child was always innocent and straightforward, and he answered again, "We all ran away. Either our parents are too poor to feed us, or we were beaten too badly by the teachers in the apprenticeships. Running away here is really miserable. We have to pull rickshaws until dawn. When we sleep, any dirty, cold, and remote corner is our bed. We never know in advance where we'll be sleeping tonight. 'Uncle's' house is for the 'Uncles'; we've never had a home, and we don't know what a home is. It used to be a little better for us. Now, we can't 'hustle business' during the day because if the police see us, they'll arrest us. Being locked up in the police station for at least twelve hours, cold and hungry, is like losing half our lives, so we have to take advantage of the late night to do some business in hiding."</p>
<p>Laughter came from the top of the bridge. Five rickshaws came up in a row. The three children jumped up and ran towards them. Sitting in the rickshaws were three dancers and two young men. The young men were wearing red and green paper hats and singing the "Romance of the Spinning Palace" song. The dancers' laughter was sharp and shrill, like the wail of a ghost. A group of racing black shadows poured down the bridgehead. Two coins were thrown from the rickshaws, because I heard two clear clinking sounds as they hit the ground. The children chased after them, shouting and scolding. One of the young men raised his hand, as if throwing something at them. A tall police officer's figure appeared like a ghost, and the children disappeared in panic into the dark alley.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Upside Down World During the Hollywood Earthquake <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>Tragedies, Comedies, and All Sorts of Things</p>
<p>Monsters and Gods in the Beauty Salon</p>
<p>At 5:55 PM on March 10th of this year, a strong earthquake occurred in Hollywood, USA. Although the shaking lasted for only a minute, the sudden shock caught the figures in the film industry off guard, and they unwittingly performed all kinds of strange dramas, including many tragedies and many jokes, in all sorts of ways, too numerous to mention. Now, I will only briefly describe some of the more important events.</p>
<p>Let's first talk about the injuries caused by the earthquake. Peggy Hopkins Joyce, known for her multiple marriages and romances, had a large burn on her face. At that time, she was curling her hair with curling tongs. When the unexpected earthquake struck, she lost her grip and pushed the red-hot tongs onto her face, resulting in a burned face. Jocelyne Lee was taking a shower at 5:55. Unexpectedly, her foot slipped, and she fell backward, like a kite flipping over, landing on her back. As a result, two vertebrae were dislocated, and she had to stay in the hospital for several days. There was also a very dangerous Anita Page. She was getting dressed upstairs, preparing to go out for dinner. After she finished dressing, she stood at the top of the stairs and talked to the people downstairs. The earthquake struck suddenly, and Anita fell down the stairs. She rolled from the top of the stairs to the bottom. She was bruised all over, and her legs were also swollen.</p>
<p>There was also Elissa Landi, who had been ill for a long time. Around six o'clock that day, she was still lying in bed when suddenly the mirror on the wall fell down, and the things in the room shook. Elissa and her mother ran outside together. Because she had been sick for a long time, she was suddenly shocked by this, and her illness became more severe. The above are some tragedies, but what about comedies?</p>
<p>Lillian Lashman said that the best place to see comedy during an earthquake is in a beauty salon. That day, she was getting dressed up in the beauty salon and was about to open the door to leave when the earthquake suddenly struck. Most of the women had white powder and blue mud smeared on their faces. Some had their hair disheveled, and some had their hair half-curled. They frantically pulled their hair off the curling irons. Everyone ran towards the door together. Lillian Lashman not only forgot her fear but burst out laughing.</p>
<p>Adrienne Ames was putting on lipstick, preparing to go out for dinner. She held the lipstick brush, carefully drawing on her lips, when suddenly there was a jolt, and the brush drew a line from her mouth all the way to her ear. She didn't realize it and rushed downstairs to escape. A maid saw that her mouth had a large crack that ran all the way to her ear and cried out in fright.</p>
<p>In addition, there were many other interesting things, but unfortunately, I can't write them all out.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e273">Review of "Roar of the Tiger, Roar of the Lion" <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Big Cage</p>
<p>Another animal movie.</p>
<p>If someone were to ask, "Why do European and American filmmakers always like to make animal movies? Is this educational film?" Then we can answer him like this: "This is escapism. At the same time, entrepreneurs are well aware of the needs of cowardly audiences to escape reality, so everyone dares not face reality squarely and contentedly watches wild animals fight."</p>
<p>Of course, if film artists can sincerely, based on educational significance, give a detailed and clear explanation of various beasts, then we are attending class when we watch movies. However, European and American colleagues will not do this. In their production process, this kind of animal film must be "horrifying," "tense," with animals fighting animals, people fighting animals, and also adding beautiful women's legs, sensual embraces, and passionate kisses. As a result, children laugh loudly, young men and women become more affectionate, and old people gain more knowledge. This is how it can be a box office success, this is how it can make money. However, watching too many of these films is inevitably dizzying.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, this has become a formula, which can be applied in "Tarzan the Ape Man," which can be applied in "Nagara," and this "Roar of the Tiger, Roar of the Lion" is naturally no exception, and of course, it is very applicable. Following the formula, change the title, and it's another set.</p>
<p>Regarding this film, according to the advertisements, there are indeed sixteen lions and sixteen tigers, but there is no way to count them clearly on the screen. However, these lions and tigers are the spirits of this film. Indeed, if we regard this film as a circus, then it is somewhat interesting. Lions biting tigers, tigers biting people, and people beating lions and tigers are very good to watch. In addition, there are gunshots, water sprays, lightning, thunder, storms, people running away, and desperate screams. It is truly "tense" and "horrifying" at the same time. Of course, this is because the director understands this formula.</p>
<p>However, in addition to the above points, the director simply did not use the method of montage for the development of the plot, and the connection between the characters before and after is not obvious. In fact, although there is a story, this story has no system at all.</p>
<p>As for the performance and other aspects, except for the protagonist's amazing skill in taming wild animals, there is nothing to commend.</p>
<p>In short, if you regard this film as a circus, you can be happy.</p>
<p>Powerlifter Peng Fei, the male lead in Yihua's new film "National Survival"</p>
<h3 id="e274">"Where to Go" Renamed "National Survival" <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Yihua Film Company's debut film, which has been promoted for a long time, is directed and written by Chen Yu. The leading actors are all famous figures on the stage (such as Shu Xiuwen, Hong Dou, Zhao Yishan, etc.), as well as powerlifters Zha Ruilong and Peng Fei. After more than half a year of work, it has now been completed. It will soon be released in Shanghai. However, the original name of the film was "Where to Go?" It is said that it has now been renamed "National Survival."</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e275">Written to the Screenwriters of "Spring Water, Affectionate Waves" <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Cheng</p>
<p>Several new films from the Star Film Company this year, such as "Flower of Freedom," "Raging Torrent," "Women's Cry," "Moral Treasure Mirror," and "The Future," have made us feel that the Star Film Company is changing its style. The audience is very gratified and hopes that the Star Film Company can continue to work hard.</p>
<p>"Spring Water, Affectionate Waves" is said to be Zheng Zhengqiu's successful work after "Flower of Freedom," but in fact, it has left us completely disappointed. Although the direction, editing, photography, and set design are all commendable, and the actors are all working very hard, it is difficult to achieve full results under the control of such a plot. Because the meaning is really too unsound. How can a good play be developed from such a multi-faceted love story?</p>
<p>According to the usual practice, this should depict the hidden pain suffered by women under the moral system of the old society and indicate the path that new women should take. But in fact, the focus has shifted. The screenwriters are not focusing on what should be done, but are working hard on the behavior of the idle class playing with women. Moreover, narrow-minded humanitarianism, revengeism, and the law of karma are even more wrong.</p>
<h3 id="e276">Star's New Film "Iron Plate Record of Red Tears" <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Nan</p>
<p>The mission of film is by no means just to provide entertainment for a portion of the idle class. It should provide for general needs and represent the appeals of the masses. The Chinese film industry seems to have this "awareness." In addition to the already released "Humanity," "Struggle," "Endeavor," "Women's Cry," and others, the Star Film Company will soon release a new film of the same meaning, "Iron Plate Record of Red Tears," which describes the tragic situation of the Sichuan people under the iron hooves of warlords who oppress and extort taxes, and represents some weak groans of the local Adou. This film is directed by Hong Shen, and the female lead, Ms. Wang Ying, has already had excellent achievements in drama and has also had good results in film. The male lead is Chen Ningqiu, who is famous in the drama world. The rest of the actors are more than twenty Fudan students who have been under Hong Shen's guidance for a long time. Undoubtedly, this film will give us a greater understanding. They are going to other places tomorrow to shoot exterior shots. In the near future, this film will appear before us.</p>
<p>Letter to Chen Du Jun: I have received your letter and read your manuscript, which has unique insights. Unfortunately, this publication is limited by its position and does not publish any text attacking any publication or individual. And all texts such as "dedicated to" or "advice" are also avoided. For example, saying "Please have a slap in the face" or "Here's a big slap in the mouth for you"; after hitting someone, you still want to make yourself look good, saying something like "please" or "here's," isn't that too hypocritical? My opinion is that if you really have the sincerity to contribute something, go visit them in person, have a long talk, and then slap them a few times and give them a slap in the mouth. I must first have the intention of a head-on blow, and people will then be able to accept it with an open mind. I don't know what you think.</p>

<p>To the Editor: In the "Recent News from the Film Industry" written by Zhou Jingzhi and published in your publication on the second of this month, it says that "Yihua Company, independently founded by Tian Han, will soon complete its first production, 'Where to Go,' etc." Our company is also named Yihua Film Company, and the founders are the well-known powerlifters Zha Ruilong and Peng Fei. There has never been a Tian Han, and the first production is "National Survival," which has now been completely completed and will soon be released, and it is not directed or written by Tian Han. To avoid misunderstandings from the outside world, we hereby send this letter and ask that it be published in your publication. Thank you very much. Respectfully, Yihua Film Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: The above news is a contribution from the outside world, which sometimes leads to inaccuracies. The editor has the duty to record what he has heard and cannot reject them all or verify them in advance. For contributors, there is little to be gained, but for the parties involved, reputation and credibility are greatly affected, and the editor suffers even more trouble. As for this news, we should ask the original author, Mr. Zhou Jingzhi, to confirm whether there is another Yihua Company founded by Tian Han. Otherwise, rumors and gossip will be sent to this publication in a jumble. Although this publication has already disclosed it, the manuscript fee will also be deducted. I'm not good at this.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Overview of Soviet Russian Films (7) <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Rudolf Meser, translated by Bao Han</p>
<p>"Regarding the production policy of Soviet film factories, they are now striving to produce 'sound films' to prepare for competition in foreign markets. These 'sound films' are different from 'talkies.' Today, Soviet Russia is concentrating its efforts and striving to manufacture them as a standard for selling overseas. 'Road to Life' was the first experiment in manufacturing sound films for foreign sales, and it has achieved great success. Here, I want to say something... but as I said before, I don't want to involve personal opinions, so there are always meanings that are not fully expressed. While the Soviet Union is striving to produce sound films, it must also strive to produce silent films, because silent films are convenient for travel and can be shown in remote villages and towns as a supreme tool for propaganda. (As for sound film equipment, today, only advertising claims that it is suitable for travel.</p>
<p>㈤ The attitude of Soviet Russia towards imported goods</p>
<p>British, American, and most German films are not very popular in Soviet Russia. The reason is that most imported films are not in sync with the spirit of the Soviet five-year plan; this reason is also to be fundamentally correct under the current situation in Soviet Russia. The German film "Comradeship" (Kameradschaft) and another silent film called "Rasputin" (also a German production) were widely broadcast in Soviet Russia. The film "Comradeship" has the meaning of cosmopolitanism, which is quite suitable for socialist countries to enjoy, and a film that can give a true depiction of the historical events of Rasputin is of course also easily welcomed. These films are all anti-despotic propaganda, and it is no wonder that they can be a sensation in Soviet Russia. But there are also things that are incomprehensible. "Dr. Jekyll," starring Harold Lloyd (i.e., Luke), was actually welcomed everywhere in Soviet Russia. "Dr. Jekyll" was an early work by Harold Lloyd, with extremely rich jokes. It came to Russia in the summer of 1932, and everyone rushed to show it. What is incomprehensible is what relationship does Harold Lloyd have with the "spirit of the five-year plan" that people are so enthusiastic about him? On the whole, the author feels that Harold Lloyd has rejected various ideological attempts; there is not much ideology to be found in his films, but they are full of laughter, so once he stepped into the film industry and eventually penetrated the Soviet screen, he established a solid foundation. His works will probably exist for a long time in Soviet Russia due to their novelty and strangeness. As the saying goes, "the exception proves the rule." Here, we can see a glimpse of the Soviet people's hunger for light entertainment. (The End)</p>
