<p>去年九一八東省禍變發動之初。全國各地之學生靑年。類都慷慨激昂。均有拼死命以衛國抗暴之表示。吾人方深自欣幸由於外患之剌激。已使我暮氣沉沉之民族。頓呈蓬勃之生氣。有此民氣。有此活力。中國終當不亡。然而此次楡關再陷。華北告急。吾人所得之消息。乃不爲平津學生靑年如何團結。共謀所以準備抗禦入室之强宼。而翻爲『提前放假』與『溜冰娛樂』種種之怪聞。國難日亟。民族已危如櫐卵。斯正爲我國人民刻苦磨礪準備赴湯蹈火之時。然而爲社會中堅份子爲國家將來主人之學生靑年。乃竟或自尋娛樂。或避難就安。充分暴露一種卑怯苟安之心理。强宼不足畏。甚至亡國亦不足畏。惟此種卑怯苟安燕巢飛幕而不自知危。横陳俎上暝目以待宰割之心理。乃眞爲致我民族死命無可挽救之痼疾。鉅難當前。漠不動心。强宼入室。惟知逃死。往日以之責人者。今則自蹈其舊轍。彼溜冰逃死之學生諸君。試一沉思默念。果能漠然無愧於中耶。雖然。吾人固亦不欲獨爲學生責也。東省禍變爆發。歷時逾載。負責當局。未嘗不以抵抗之决心與準備昭示於我人民。然而事實上則仍爲不戰不　之局面。而黨派之間。又復意見紛歧。軍閥則混戰不已。政府旣不能以堅决之態度。明白之事實。一致之目標昭示國人。以收拾横决之民心以樹立中心之信仰。以集中渙散之力量。俾民氣得以伸張。人民之精神得有所寄託。而徒因循觀望。欲俟機會以效死。則一鼓而作之民氣。再而衰。三而竭。怯弱者銷沉以苟安。强悍者則行險以快意。如今日平津學生之一方面或溜冰自娛。或遷安逃死。而另一方面則亦有擲炸彈投警告信之激烈行爲。蓋亦爲勢所必至。故今日爲民氣銷沉而徒專責學生靑年。蓋亦　矣。</p>

<p>丨汪洗平君來信丨</p>
<p>貴報「乃」君前次在時評上提到「恐慌週期律」的問題，其中有這樣的話「盛衰循環之說，不特爲吾國先哲所樂道，歐西經濟學者，亦當認爲至理、卽所謂恐慌週期律是也。吾人對於恐慌週期律，並不欲加以根本之否認，惟有須加以修正者」。我當時看了這一段話，心裏就有點疑惑，因爲吾人對於恐慌週期律，並不欲加以根本之否認，惟有須加以修正者。」我當時看了這一段話，心裏就有點疑惑。因爲據乃君之意，歐洲經濟學者之主張恐慌週期律說，大都是和吾國先哲所謂「循環」之說一樣，現在才勞我們中國的乃君來代他修正，把「走馬燈式」的恐慌週期說，變爲「螺旋式」的恐慌週期說，其實事實不是如此，所以我提出這個問題，意在提醒乃君歐西經濟學者所謂恐慌週期律，並不僅是「走馬燈式」的，而且有「螺旋式」的，似乎不勞乃君來修正。還勞乃君加以發揮與以擁　，我且把歐西經濟學者之唯物辨證法的恐慌週期說介紹在下面，藉供參考，並註明這是「一八九四年」所發表的。惟因他種原因，未能卽將著者及書名指出。後來貴報發表此文，乃將上項一段重要介紹文字删去，同時乃君答案，承認「經濟學正統派認巩慌週期律是走馬燈式的」。意在言外，非正統派的經濟學者或許也有反對這種走馬燈式的恐慌週期說的可能，我想也就算了；因爲讀者顧問欄也不是可以充分做討論這種問題地方。今日又從友人處看見乃君關於我前次所提出的問題，有這樣的意見；」···甚有意義，惜措詞頗不明，想係作者事忙之故，如能請作者加以整理及再提出討論，亦頗有趣也。」所謂「措詞頗不明」究屬何指？我所介紹的一種關於恐慌週期說，完全　自著者原文，措詞頗不明，是指我的譯文呢？還是指我的所譯的原文呢？此外我並没有自已妄加意見，現在再把我當時關於這個問題的原文，重新錄在下面，請敎：「乃君關於恐慌週期之結，立意甚　當，惟是一八九四年所發表的恐慌週期律學說，並不如乃君所說，茲就原文略略介紹如下「輸出人的統計給現實的，卽生產資本與商品資本之積集一個標準。並且在統計中時常指示出下述的事實，卽就十年的循環期中的運行的英國工業（一八一五至一八七○年）的發展時期說，每次在恐慌的最後的興盛期最高限度，就從新表現而爲下次興盛期的最低限度，然後再升高到一個更高的新的最高限度。」遂卽從統計上給我們一個事實的證明道：「營業興盛期一八一四年的大英國與　爾蘭輸出生　產品之現實的卽伸報的價値爲四○·三九六·三○○鎊。然後一八二五年的恐慌，輸出額就低落在這個總額之下並搖擺及年三千五百萬與三千九百萬之間。因一八三四年景氣恢復，輸出額又升高並超過了先前最高的水準，達到四一·六四九·一九一鎊，而到了一八三六年則達到五三·三六八·五七一鎊之新的最高限度。繼而一八三七年輪出額又减低到四千二百萬，這樣新的最低限度已經高過舊的最高限度，於是就搖擺於五千發與五千三百萬鎊之間。一八四四年就氣恢復，因而把輸出額升高到五千八百五十萬，卽一八二六年的最高限度，已經又被這次輸出額遠遠地超乎其上了。一八四五年輸出額達到六○·一一一·○八二鎊；於是在一八四六年五千七百萬鎊而强，一八四七年約五千九百萬，一八四八年約五千三百萬，一八四九年昇高到六千三百五十萬，一八五三年約九千九百萬，一八四九年升高到六千三百五十萬，一八五三年約九千九百萬，一八五四年九千七百萬，一八五五年五千四百五十萬，一八五六年約一萬萬六百萬，而一八五七年以一萬萬二千二百萬達到最高限度。一八五八年輸出額减低到一萬萬一千六百萬，然而到一八五九年已經升到一萬萬三千萬，一八六○年約一萬萬三千六百萬，一八六一年只有一萬萬二千五百萬（這裏新的最低限度又高過以前的最高限度，）一八六三年一萬萬四千六百五十萬鎊（同上　丨同上頁）。這種恐慌的週期的發展，不是「走馬燈式的」，而是「螺旋式的」明甚；就是說，他不是形式　　的（也可說，不是經濟學正統派的）而是辦證法的否定之否定的更高這段之發展。」······上面這段文字除了我删去了恭維乃君的一些話和添上「不是經濟學正統派的」幾個字以外，統是照着上次原文抄下來的。　我這種愚笨的理解；他解釋恐慌週期律的意思很明白，並没有「不明」的地方，而我所下的兩名註脚更是明顯之至，不知乃君所謂「措辭頗不明」究屬何指，　有以敎之。（再者此文所介紹之文，係　自德文資本論第三卷第一册二九頁。討論文字，若果報上不便發表，請由乃君函復可也）</p>
<p>記者按：關於「恐慌週期律」一問題，汪君及覆來函討論，額　興趣，右函所述意見，如本報乃君認爲尙有商量之處，予以繼續討論外，讀者諸君如有高見，　請　函討論。</p>

<p>— 仲賢</p>
<p>▲兩隻面孔</p>
<p>上海人的面孔，　金　　般的，會有「　頭」，然而翻來覆去，祇有兩隻面孔：一隻眞面孔，一隻假面孔，實在也翻不出什麽新花樣。</p>
<p>多數上海人，見了人點頭一笑之後，就開口問人，「老史吃過飯嗎」？其實他心裏何需要知道别人的吃飯問題，别人的飯吃與不吃，與他毫不相干。可見他一開口就透出假來。</p>
<p>處世接物，如果拿出眞面孔來，難免要到處吃虧碰釘子。大家不得不用假面孔來週旋一切，所以我們所見的面孔都是「反面」，永遠不見是面孔的「正面」。</p>
<p>上海的人如此，上海的地方也是如此。</p>
<p>上海的表面是何等美麗呵！平坦寛闊的馬路，立體式的偉大建築，照耀似白晝的電光，和其他一切物質文明的專用，都是内地人所意想不到的，上海眞同天堂一樣！</p>
<p>上海的反面是什麽？這是平常走在馬路上的人所不易見到的，報紙的　　新聞裏僅能表現千萬份之一。</p>

<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>丨字雖不同聲音同丨</p>
<p>多日的和煖，一夜的北風，於是吹來了這一塲大雪。</p>
<p>講到了這『雪』，古往今來，騷人墨客，爲了它做出了多少韻事。什麽踏雪尋梅，什麽對雪賦詩，以及羊羔美酒，欣賞雪景，說不盡的許多及時行樂。總而言之，在往年『國泰民安』的時候，這『雪』原是最美的人間點綴品啊！</p>
<p>然而，在這『國難』的期間，暴日的鐵蹄所至，我國的山河變色，浴血抗日的，只有那東北義軍！那麽，如今一夜北風，吹來了這一塲大雪，只爲是這時北風吹來的雪，我覺得有點義軍的血腥氣　　同時，我更覺得這『雪』與『血』，字雖不同聲音同。以前在『國泰民安』的時候，自然不覺得。可是，如今『國難期間』，看見了這『雪』不由不想到了那『血』丨義軍的血丨不知國人這時見了這潔白的『雪』，可能想到那鮮紅的『血』嗎？</p>

<p>丨影戲，跳舞，高爾夫，丨</p>
<p>「密斯×請去看影戲好麽？國泰的今天這張片子很不錯。」</p>
<p>這樣的一個請求，固然對女朋友是非常客氣而也算是漂亮了，如果你向女朋友這樣提議的時候。但是事實上却常常不見得會那樣容易。客氣當然是另一回事，因爲這答案呢，却是會有這樣的結果：「對不住，我已有Ｅogagement了，」或者「呵，我没有空，密斯脫張約好到Camidrome去Fea　Dance。」</p>
<p>由這後者的結果，那就告訴了你，看影戲固然是摩登，這是不須說的，但是跳舞不是摩登化麽？所以你要摩登十足，必須會得跳舞，自然你能請看影戲，當然能請跳舞，不過退一步講，你要跳舞方算摩登，這是無庸諱言的。</p>
<p>×　　　×　　　　×</p>
<p>「密斯脫李，ＷeeＧolf，你會打麽」？</p>
<p>「聖愛娜的高爾夫球塲算頂好了，你覺得怎樣？」</p>
<p>「·········」。</p>
<p>這樣的問話常常上會由你的女友們當面向你說起的，或者在影戲館，在咖啡座裏，在舞塲中，在其他地方的對話裏。</p>
<p>「跳了這次舞，去打ＷeeＧolf嗎？密斯張」。</p>
<p>「Ｂoy，買兩張高爾夫票子。」</p>
<p>「·········」</p>
<p>同樣的談話會由摩登的靑年們慇慇地去問女友。</p>
<p>×　　　×　　　×</p>
<p>因此，要合乎這現時代摩登的階段，必須曾懂得這三部曲丨影戲，跳舞，高爾夫。</p>

<p>— 亦菴</p>
<p>丨有兩點値得注意丨</p>
<p>這是一位專家的意見；現在有許多文明社會裏的人們，尤其是女子們，都在主張生育節制，以爲人種可以得到較優良的選擇，貧窮者可以减輕點負担，勞動階級的婦女可以减少兒女的贍顧，婦女可以减少點孕育的痛苦。除却第三四點是事實之外，其餘兩點就頗値得注意。事實告訴我們，節制生育的結果是優秀階級的生育率减少得多而不優秀階級的生育率却比較增加。因爲會得施用節制生育的方法的，多屬於優秀階級中人，面且其方法及預防又比較來得周密。所以優秀階級的生育率就會銳减，而不優秀階級的生育率就比較增多。那末以後的社曾人種是否會比較優良</p>

<p>— 了紅瘦鵑</p>
<p>他倆驚急地扶到家裏，東方生已是昏然了。到晚上，略見淸醒，他舉起無神的眸子。向着二人斷續地說道··「···我能在池塘邊向吾主交代了我自已，可稱夙願已償。我死了以後，請你們把我葬在錢塘江邊，那邊我認爲最適宜做我的歸宿處丨你倆，我也很知道是互愛着，仍請繼續永相愛好吧。」</p>
<p>小曼聽了，祇能默認着，伊没法兒在這千鈞一髮的一刹那，用最妥當而最簡略的語句來解睾誤解。在歐陽也祇有默然，他内心在懺海，明知這次的罪惡，是他一人造出來的。假如自已没有做出愛小曼的表示，决不會使摰友東方生的舊疾，引得復發。這樣的傷痕，在歐陽的心版上，委實印的太深了，他終身愧懟着自已。</p>
<p>東方夫人把東方生葬到錢塘江邊。在那裏鄰近，有一所耶穌敎創辦的醫院，伊把别墅賣了，帶了那女僕，在墓旁另建起一所房屋來。伊除了日間到醫院裏去服務外，晨夕終是在墓旁那所屋子裏，希望這樣懺悔伊的一生。</p>
<p>歐陽生自東方生死後，依舊過他的飄零生活。他覺得以前的舊家庭，還未見得十分受苦，他對於東方生所造的罪惡，才夠良心上責備的痛苦，每一回憶，無限悽愴。這五年之中，曾每年一度，到過東方墓上去祭掃，這回却又很會不由自主地走到這條路上來，路上祇有兩行樹，還像當年一樣。他走到他塘邊，覺得幽靜得比以前更厲害。四圍的一切，似乎都在向他發怒，但他寗願捱受一切的揶揄，因爲他的罪惡太大了。</p>

<p>歐陽生倚在樹上痴想着，全部的罪惡史，一幕幕地過去，直到他這次到池塘爲止。他猛然覺得晚風微動，很有寒氣。天上已在漸漸白起來，分明已在破曉，他不自知爲什麽竟會出神了一夜。他踽踽地由原路回去，兩旁的樹木，點頭也似的歡送着，也許是在說··「歐陽先生，你不必疚心，奮發你的將來，圖報你的好友吧。」（完）</p>

<p>丨替窮朋友想方法丨</p>
<p>鋒利如剪刀般的朔風，又在向人們攻襲了，人們除了添加重裘之外，簡直没有旁的防禦方法。</p>
<p>這樣說來，有產階級，是有特無恐了嗎？不，不，不，一般凍餒着的兇神，正在計算冬季的衣食問題，要着落在你們身上解决哩。你們的皮衣愈重，他們的利益更大。</p>
<p>凡街燈如豆，冷僻荒蕪，巡警目光不及之處，都是他們的勢力圈。在更深人靜，風聲如濤，樹影若鬼的當兒，正是他們步哨密佈，擇人而噬的時候。假使你們不知輕重，誤聞防線，他們就當作突圍之豕，操刃直前，加以剥皮處分，被害者縱不喪掉性命，也要凍出病來。所以在下奉勸諸位，到了冬天的夜裏，在外的早早回家，在家的早早睡覺，才可免受意外的損失和驚嚇。可是話又說回來了，他們的衣食問題，終是要解决的，他們在夜裏一無所獲，也許會在日就成爲問題。現今施用生育節制的多屬中上社會，至於下層階級仍然照常生活，那末他們的負担仍然没有减輕。照現在美國情形而論，凡是未成年的男學生和高等學校年齡大的女學生都學得了節制生育的方法，因爲學得了節制生育方法的靑年多了，於是性的道德也一天天敗壞了。</p>

<p>丨庚　洞之進丨</p>
<p>茶點學，各仗電炬，由儲翁及毛局長爲導，徧遊兩旁各小洞。如水　，地道，　　，　鼻，七　等。石　盤旋，倐升倐降。或深　　　，寒氣　人；或陽光微送，如行地　。洞中有石　·石床·石凳之　。石柱二，挻直　空，如中流碈柱，柱旁凈水一泓，云　翁虔　所得，洞中飲料，均取給於此。復有巨石　然，如巨龍張吻，下　二石，酷肖魚形，一住一回，錫以鯉魚跳龍門之名，良確。小洞均幽遂緊迥，低曲　窕；出此人彼，如　蝶穿花，幾疑身化微菌，游行於血絡中也。洞中石級，計共千餘，工程之　，於斯可證。儲翁經營二洞，凡十餘年，斥資近二十萬，幾盡耗其產，曼華女士，亦出　　相補助，其熱忱毅力，有足多矣。嗟夫，儲翁奇人也！苟能展其長才，何　拯斯民於水火，獨戀戀於此二洞何哉，豈夭心猶未厭　，而麟鳳不得不潜威耶？君子於此，可以觀世變矣。雖然，人傑則地靈，二洞得儲翁之名而益顯，午載而下，苟有過此者，吾知其必低徊留戀而不忍去也，則翁之功，爲不朽矣。</p>
<p>余與伯翔，伯洲昆仲同游，跬步不離，旣索隱而探幽；復攝　影留鴻爪。數小時間，踵無停趾，不特不覺其勞，反苦時光之促，甚矣境物之足以移人也。伯翔更欲細審其特點，以爲他日繪事之需，其勞瘁當更有甚於余者矣。</p>
<p>游畢，復登後洞看　，觀能子女士舞劍：勁裝窄袖，態有餘妍。雙劍盤旋，銀光閃爍，繼以雙刀，極兎起　落之致。女士工詩善書，並諳音律，擊劍其餘技耳。舞畢由儲翁代索字畫，以爲木桃之報，愧余不才，無以應命，爲可憾耳。臨行時，儲翁復命燃爆竹相送，厚誼高情，直令身受者無以爲報；挹勝　　，有不忍恝然去之者矣。</p>
<p>離洞後，步行回舟；胡君伯翔，翁之舊友也，途中相與討論洞中美術上建設各點，娓娓不倦。九時進晚　，席間儲翁詳述洞中　跡，如讀千寳搜神之記，令人樂而忘倦。並謂：一俟洞務告竣，卽將　遁，水離娑婆。蓋翁養性　眞。廿載於茲，微悟本來，六根解脫，駕年車而出火宅，同意中事也，不學如余，又烏能窺其萬一，所惜倉猝之間，遇善知識而不能多事請益，引以爲憾。</p>
<p>二十七日晨離宜，下午抵錫，乘京滬車返申。此行也，儲翁叔姪，及女公子能子，媳曼華女士等殷勤招待，意殊可感。毛局長撥冗爲導，一路伴游，舟行苦悶，則談笑風生，片語解頤，盡突梯滑　之能事；微毛君，同人等又安能有賓至如歸之樂，則敖君之功爲不小矣。至於一路舟車膳宿，均由團中常委姚元幹，劉玉麒二君妥爲照料，其熱忱殊堪欽佩，附此以誌謝悃。</p>

<h3 id="c203">瘋人（三） <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>這時候大家　注意着這狗母子，對於瘋人也就不大留心了。不提防瘋人却拿起一塊大石頭對準　狗照頭一下。於是女人們都呀的一聲呌了出來，小孩兒們　得從人　中跑出去。只見那正在生產的狗先　掙扎　動了幾下，其後可就不能　　了。可是已經得着生命的小狗們，却並不曾感着若何悲哀，仍在母親的懷中　動着，希望能在微温的乳房中吮着幾滴乳水。然而母親却已死去了。</p>
<p>不知在什麽時候，瘋人已經走開了。這裏還剩下狗兒媽媽和另外的幾個女人。還有二癩痢也痴痴的對着死狗發呆，口裏輕輕地駡着：</p>
<p>「該死的瘋子」！</p>
<p>然而狗已死了，不成問題，小狗不久也就會死的，雖然這一來也許扣　了人們的心弦，可是只有一刹那的時分，她們女人又談起關於瘋子的事來了。</p>
<p>她們談了很久，二癩痢此刻聽着的是狗兒媽媽在說：</p>
<p>「不過王老四到也是一個滿有志氣的人哩，說話也很有理性。他一到晚上没有事的時候，便坐到我家　來　談，他常是這樣說：「我也一天老似一天了，到現在還没有一個老婆，這樣下去，將來不是要絶後了嗎？不過苦了這許多年，現在總算又說定了一　，若是祖宗保　，將來娶過門來，就能夠生下一男半女，就是死也甘心」。</p>
<p>「所以，他打定主意；趁今年年成好，天老爺保祏多收了幾　　，到下月裏將多着的賣出去，買副新被　，圖年老婆來了也好有張乾凈床　。可是他又和我商量：</p>
<p>「還欠吳大爺家裏幾擔陳租，到底還不還呢？他家裏的賬房已經來催過幾次了」。</p>
<p>「還是欠住一年罷」，我說：「你到吳大爺那裏去好好的求情，他是做過官的，知書識理的，而且吳太太也是吃齋唸佛的做好事的人，大槪總會可憐你的吧」。</p>
<p>「我對他這樣說了，他也很以爲有理。···誰知這樣的一個懂道理的人突然會瘋起來的呢？眞是老天没有眼睛呀」！</p>
<p>大家聽來，都没有什麽好說，默默的。其後狗兒媽媽又想說些什麽，嘴唇動　着，於是二癩痢連忙搶着說：</p>
<p>「吳老四前天到我東家家裏去還欠租的時候還是好好的哩」。</p>
<p>也許這句話說得太不響亮，並不能使大家如何注意。這時候又有誰在談着那年官兵强姦王老四的老婆的事，以及他老婆怎樣貞節的誓死不從，終至殺死在亂刀之下。可是二癩痢因爲這裏的人並不將他放在眼裏，也就氣忿忿跑開了。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c204">「不准動」與「偏要動」 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 楊幸之</p>
<p>前年十二月七日，戴季陶先生曾發表一封「給全國敎育家及學生家長的一封公開信」。信中最警關的幾句是：「樹苗自由，不能成長；靑年自由，不能成人。」最近江蘇省敎育廳長周佛海先生也發表了一封「告全蘇學生家長書」，其中尤多令人擊節三嘆的警句丨如：「抗師干紀，以摀亂爲革命精神，狂肆放恣，以橫决爲個性發展······於是在校則有驅長擇師之潮，在家則高唱非孝革命之說。」戴周兩函，主張完全相同，而文章之潑剌刻毒，周文實在比戴文還要做得好，還動聽。我想「老年人」讀了，一定會爲之浮幾大白，而「靑年人」讀了，則一定會爲之伸舌頭。</p>
<p>從戴文到周文，我們可以很明顯地看出當前政府對於人民的要求，此一要求之眞實意義即爲「安内」，而「整飭學風」與「囗囗」，實即爲一刃之兩面。</p>
<p>本來，自從前年九一八事變以來，不僅是靑年，差不多大多數的人都在「動」，在「轉變」，整個社會都在顚播不寗的波濤裏動盪。然而這種動盪的局勢不是偶然約，它是外患與内亂交相煎逼的結果，也就是時代轉捩的動向。</p>
<p>「靜止」！「安定」！「不准自由」！「自由者！」！這是戴周兩先生的呼聲，也就是政府的呼聲。然而從幾千年來的中外歷史上觀察，人民决不肯放棄自由，而時代也從來不曾接受過「向後轉」的命令。你不准動，其如時代偏要動何？</p>

<p>Ａ（坐在Ｂ旁）我到××橋。你呢？</p>
<p>Ｂ我就到前邊去。長遠不見了！</p>
<p>Ａ長遠不見了！生意好嗎？</p>
<p>Ｂ馬馬虎虎。現在市面太淸淡。你很得意罷？</p>
<p>Ａ不過是混混。現在生意難做得很！</p>
<p>Ｂ有空過來白相白相。</p>
<p>Ａ好。你有空也請過來。我這裏都是些熟朋友。</p>
<p>Ｂ（此時Ａ買票）你那裏電話幾號？</p>
<p>Ａ我們是新搬　的，電話還没有裝好哩。</p>
<p>Ｂ現在裝電話很討厭！起碼得半年。</p>
<p>Ａ我們還有路道，快要裝好了。</p>
<p>Ｂ我家裏電話是四三六七五！你要來的時候，先打個電話。</p>
<p>Ａ（拿出記事簿）請你寫在那裏。啊！對不起！你貴姓！我忘記了。</p>
<p>Ｂ（一　寫）是的是的。我給你一齊寫上。</p>
<p>Ａ（看簿子）是的。王先生，我眞該死！上一回我們不是還在　狗塲遇見嗎？</p>
<p>Ｂ你同你的夫人一道。</p>
<p>Ａ不錯不錯。那天，她眞輸得一塌糊塗，笑話極了。</p>
<p>Ｂ你今年做什麽生意？</p>
<p>Ａ我今年只買進了不賣出。什麽便宜就買什麽。鐵便宜就收鐵，疋頭跌了，就收疋頭。也不用現錢交易，先收進再說。將看漲的時候再放出去。這樣做法還好。</p>
<p>Ｂ這倒是一個法子。</p>
<p>Ａ自已給自已做，比帮人家總好一點。這年頭，這樣混混，混過去，也就算了。</p>
<p>Ｂ這年頭，誰還不是胡混混哩。你這樣做，開支可以省下了。</p>
<p>Ａ嗐！不要提起開支了。兩處家，每處一月三百塊總要，兩處就得六查塊。誰也一個不肯少。一年到頭，忙來忙去，還不是忙了個養家。</p>
<p>Ｂ可不是？養活一個家也不是容易的事，虧你還　養兩個家。</p>
<p>Ａ有什麽法子呢！起初，由學堂出來，在洋行裏，每月賺不到二十塊錢，還要餘十來塊。現在賺頭倒多了，却還總嫌不夠開銷。</p>
<p>Ｂ唉！彼此都是一樣。啊，我到了，我要下去了。有空請過來玩。</p>
<p>Ｂ怱怱下車去，Ａ將上身　門壁，頭向車窗外望，口吹「愛我今宵」之曲。</p>
<p>賣票（走至Ａ前）先生，你坐過了，請加票。</p>
<p>Ａ什麽！已經到了麽？要加好多？</p>
<p>賣票你到底到什麽地方？</p>
<p>Ａ我到××橋呀。</p>
<p>賣票請你加張起　票，七分。</p>
<p>Ａ好了。不過半站路。我就下去了。</p>
<p>賣票不加票不行，我要被處分的。</p>
<p>Ａ（生氣）你爲什麽老早不告訴我？我偏不加！難道只許你們揩油嗎？（忽和緩）大家馬馬算算了。</p>
<p>車已至××橋，Ａ一躍而下。</p>
<p>賣票揩油，我揩過你的油？（向窗外）西裝穿得漂漂亮亮的，只會揩油，媽的···！</p>

<p>雪花兒在飄。</p>
<p>天像張着一面大簛箕，在撒粉。地上，牆頭上，屋頂上，一片白，積着的粉有寸來厚。</p>
<p>開開門，一陣冷風，撲面生痛，雪花兒蓋上身，像棉絮。</p>
<p>撑着傘，走到路上，雪給人脚踏成了泥，滑躂躂地。</p>
<p>路旁的行道樹，法國梧桐，葉兒全掉下，只剩着枯枝兒向天伸，雪壓在枯枝兒上，蕭索。</p>
<p>淸道夫，執着長柄帚，彎腰在掃雪。口鼻裏噴出熱氣，像兩道白烟。</p>
<p>一個外國女太太，皮大氅兒厚厚，鞋跟底兒高高，各答各答的，牵着一匹叭兒狗從路上走過，狗嘴裏啣着片生牛肉，狗項下一顆銅鈴叮呤叮呤儘是響。</p>

<p>霞飛路，像掉在冰鑊子裏，半個鬼影都没有。只有兩三個白俄，抖抖慄慄的，縮在弄堂裏打哆嗦。</p>

<p>— 盛夷</p>
<p>皮膚的疾病，是我人最易犯的毛病。雖則：我們别的疾病没有，但是有犯這皮膚的疾病，幾何十之七八。現在拿最普通的皮膚的疾病，分述如下··</p>
<p>皮膚的疾病，最普通的大槪是有癬，痣，斑面，皰，疿，胼胝，六種。㈠癬，癬有疥癬，黄癬，二種，最爲重症。疥癬，就是疥瘡，是係一種疥癬蟲寄生在皮膚上起的，寄处的地方，發生小泡，覺得非常發癢，常要搔爬，搔爬後，便有結痂的，這呌做乾疥瘡，有化膿的，呌做濕疥瘡，同臥的人，極易傳染。治法用硫磺，醇精，滑石，石鹼，猪油等，製成軟膏，每日塗擦一次，至愈爲度。黄癬就是癩頭瘡，係一種黄癬菌寄生在頭部起的，寄生的地方，先起圓形小斑點次生小水泡，而後結成黄色的小圓板，并放一種臭氣，以致毛髮脫落，覺得很癢，常要搔爬，雖至出血不止。治法可先剃去頭髮，用油類塗在黄色圓板上，使漸軟化，隨即剥去，然後再塗昇上汞和酒精，這樣病自可愈。㈡痣，痣有肉痣，硃砂痣，靑痣，三種。肉痣凸起在皮膚上，没有特别的顔色，形狀大小不一，這是皮下乳頭發達的緣故，可用刀割去，再塗上防腐劑，自可痊愈。硃砂痣和靑痣比皮膚略凸，多呈圓形，係皮膚下的乳頭凸起，并有色質沉着的緣故；紅的就呌做硃砂痣，靑的就呌做靑痣。這種痣生在皮膚上，本無大礙，如欲除去，那末可用硝酸或石灰，拌入斑螯，點在痣上，經數日後，痣即脫落。㈢斑，斑有母斑，雀斑，白斑，三種。母斑是小兒生出時就有的，色紅的，就呌做硃砂斑，色靑的，就呌做靑斑，大小無定，在皮膚上并不凸起；雀斑大槪黑色，常生在面部，大小多少，也不一定，在皮膚上也不凸起：這兩種斑都因色質增殖的緣故，方纔漸漸發生的。白斑色白，他的原因，和母斑雀斑相反，却是生斑的部分，色質萎縮的緣故，大槪發生在十歲到三十歲的時候，大小不一：還有生後混身全白的，也是白斑的變相哩。㈣面皰，面皰常生在面部，係皮脂腺内的皮膚蓄積而起，但往往有一種毛囊蟲，同時寄生：大槪發生在靑年時代，不潰爛的，呌做面皰，或呌粉剌，潰爛的呌做座瘡。治法可用針挑破·擠出裏面的内容物，丨膿和血丨再塗昇防腐劑便愈。㈤疿，又呌汗疹；因暑天氣候很熱，皮膚被汗液浸漬，便生小紅粒，時時發癢。治法，汗多的洗溶要勤，洗後搽酒精或花露水，再用容易吸去水分的粉末去撲，便可痊愈。㈥胼胝，就是生在手掌或足蹠上的硬皮，因爲手足和硬物，互相摩擦而起；雖可用刀削去，但不久增生如故，無法治愈。又有喜着緊鞋，以致硬皮發生在足趾上，行走時很痛的，呌做鷄眼，和胼胝略同；不過中央有一凹窩，稍可分别。治法可用刀削去，或用藥使他軟化，但以後不可再喜着緊鞋，這樣便可自愈，否則無效。</p>

<p>— 一萍</p>
<p>踏下電車，要轉入一條長而且黯的小弄，纔到我的家。我因爲每夜走熟了的緣故，數着步伐，可以知道某處一根電桿木突出在路的中央；某處下過了雨，積成水窪。</p>
<p>昨夜，踏下電車，轉入弄口，遠遠望見垃圾桶旁圍上一堆人，每人手中擎着火油的手照。這裏，我歸來的時候，從不見人影和燈光。「不知發生了什麽</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>事」？我懷欵着快走幾步。</p>
<p>「秤了打花會去」一個工人模樣的快活的說：</p>
<p>我聽了心中已猜上一半，走近垃圾桶旁，從圍着的人後望去，果然是一個死了的孩子。「倒是男囝」蘇州老媽子感傷地說：但是大半都贊工人的提議，預備發財。</p>
<p>我離開了這一羣人，避過電桿木，跳過水窪，開了後門，黑暗中摸進自已的臥室，坐上就近的椅子，想，無目的的想，忘了扭亮電燈。</p>
<p>遇着這樣的事，不祇一回了。說是窮貧人家的孩子吧？不會！無論家裏怎樣窮，孩子又怎樣多；再生下來，做父母的不能敎養他們。但是世上有這樣殘忍的父母嗎，把自已的親骨肉垃圾桶旁邊一抛？他們不會送給没有孩子的人家，再不然送到慈善機關去。　說是那孩子生下地來就死去的，也不會。一定用東西遮蔽了，或者在野外掘地埋葬。本來「死」是人最怕的，而且我國也有，「入土爲安」的諺語，難道　　一個無辜的初生的孩子，反而隨處　抛？於是我肯定那是一個私生子。</p>
<p>想起私生子，「私生子」本身是潔白的，而罪惡是應敢歸諸他的父母。但是社會爲什麽對於私生子任意加害。是製造罪惡的人御咎，還是私生子的命運如此？</p>
<p>「戀愛自由」，現在鄕下的毛頭姑娘也知道。中國是隻没有學步的小馬，一下子皮鞭打上牠的屁股，於是努力，毌寗說拚命向前亂跑。結果，借着「戀愛自由」的名，造成莫大的罪惡。</p>
<p>都市，尤其是罪惡的淵藪，一切的誘惑，脅迫在靑年的周圍。大學生講戀愛，包車夫講戀愛，二房東的女兒講戀愛，搖舢板的小三子講戀愛。造戀愛的大集成是抛在垃圾桶邊的私生子。</p>
<p>關外的地圖已變了色，沉醉在戀愛自由中的人們製造你們的私生子吧！或者今後更有「養妮子救國」等名稱發現。</p>

<p>余十四歲時，因家境貧苦，就此輟學；一直到十六歲，經多方請托，才得到上海×錢莊學業。不幸去年十月，受了種種剌激；意志薄弱的我，意出於一酖酒婦人」的下策。後遇妓女素貞，自知操此賤業，永無出頭之望，爲終身計，曲意相從。我因伊知甘識苦，矢志靡他，亦别爲　　知已。迄今三月，我們意訂了白首之盟。但是我的腦海裏，常存着幾個問題丨㈠此事未經徵得家長同意，倘被發覺她是一個妓女，那末定遭强烈反對。㈡結婚是要有公開儀式的；與妓女結婚，怕爲親友所不齒，或者還要影響到我的位置。㈢她操此賤業，已有四載，將來生育上有不有妨害？㈣她今年已二十三，而我却年才十九·年齡如此相差，生理上會發生問題否？㈤我的經濟能力，尙不能負擔結婚費用，她倒肯繼續這生活一年，俾可積蓄一些銀錢。這計策行不行？㈥若意與之絶·那末彼此一往情深，心靈上的創痕，又怎樣可以消滅呢？丨因此遲疑不决，望先生有以敎之。專肅敬請</p>

<p>編者按；妓女是一般人認爲最下賤的：的確她不但能使去冶遊的少年墮落；即其本身，也有「如入飽魚之肆，久</p>

<p>茲有四開　三層高大店面一所裝修生財電燈電話一應具全地段熱閙　合　店之</p>
<p>用頂費低廉如合意者請至南京路一九一號二樓　　君接洽　　可也</p>
<p>而不聞其臭」的危險。但是這也不能一槪而論，其中知甘識苦，矢志從良的，也不在少數，此所謂風塵中的奇女子也。至於嫖妓宿倡，原是甘入下流，不足爲訓的。但是一旦倦遊知返，想找個對手來寄托他放浪的心靈，也未始非回頭的初步。所以與妓女結婚，我們雖不敢貿然贊成；但在特種環境之下，也可以承認的。</p>
<p>據洪君自述，「家境貧苦」，習業迄今，算來才及三年，「經濟能力，尙不能負擔結婚費用」。那末以前治遊的費用，究屬如何挹注？有没有掉過槍花？你却要請洪君返躬自省的。如其有之，　　那末今後必須兢兢業業，設法彌補。這段姻緣，只得忍痛割絶，否則一旦發覺，將置身無地矣。我們雖不敢「以小人之心，度君子之量」，但爲忠於職務起見，故不覺其言之直耳。</p>
<p>如其没有上述的情形，那末洪君過去種種的差悞，我們可以用「旣往不咎」四個字來結束。就他提出的問題來討論了。</p>
<p>開頭的第一第二兩問題，只有用「說謊」的辦法來對付。我們深知說謊是不道德的；但是在這頑固的社會裏，求人諒解，是說穿喉嚨都不中用的，所以除下說謊以外，更無良策。好使妓女與良家女子，根本就没有顯着的　分呀！第三個問題有賴於醫生的鑑定，而且　手續早應在訂婚前解决的。洪君因爲迷戀的緣故，竟大意過去，使我們對於他「知甘識苦，矢志靡他」的觀察，也發生疑慮。趁此大錯未鑄的時候，希望洪君再用冷靜而銳利的眼光去觀察一下罷。第四問題是無庸顧慮的，因爲配偶雙方的年齡，相差三四歲，是極普通而不會發生妨害的。第五問題，那斷斷不行，常人說妓女的生活，如在火坑；安有救人於水火，而可以廷遲的呢？况「近朱者赤，近墨者黑」，對方的品性，怕也要受其影響。至經濟因難，那末只有節衣縮食的辦法，好在對方是一個吃得苦中苦的女子呀丨至第六問題，那末根本矛盾，我們以爲經考慮後而認爲可娶，則何必言絶；認爲不可娶，則根本失了愛的基礎，即與之絶，也不至創痛的。</p>

<p>『哦，我明白了』！桑老板恍然大悟。『八成兒他是昨晚就進去了』。</p>
<p>『豈止昨晚，夜夜如此，你自已不留神罷了』。</p>
<p>『怪哉，怪哉！老的是他的嫂子，小的是他的姪女兒，他的對手方究竟是誰』？</p>
<p>『老的今年三十六，小的十八歲，他的年紀正在當中間兒丨聽說恰巧二十七歲，兩頭都夠得上。若問「誰跟誰」？那是誰也摸不淸，除非他們自已』。　　『你以前得過死去的大太太多少恩典，茂生又是她所心愛的孩子，我們看着他受人欺侮，難道就一點不想法子搭救嗎？』</p>
<p>『不瞞你說，我早就料到他們要下毒手對付茂生的了』。</p>
<p>『這個小孩子』桑老板很着急的追問，『現在究竟在那裏？不要讓他流落才好』。</p>
<p>老板娘已將蠶豆剥好，偷偷的對桑老板一歪嘴，桑老板會意，便跟她到房裏商量計策去了。</p>
<p>（二）老爺情長，太太氣短</p>
<p>江南的三等以下的鄕紳人家，在第一重大門的牆門間裏，都半借給裁縫開着成衣舖子。却不一定是主人貪圖幾個有限的房金，纔將牆門間出租的；因爲人家的牆門，除非有婚喪大事，平常日子老是空着，毫無用處。主人起居飲食的屋子，都深深的藏在三四進廳堂後面，要照應大門口的雜事，勢非另設一個門房不可。三等以下的鄕紳，與貴人交際的機會甚少，花錢僱一個應門的門公來，也不過一天到晚坐在門中吃飯打磕銃罷了。偶而有貴客臨門，弄一個睡眼惺忪的人出去應對，反而不很冠冕，不如租給人家開設裁縫舖子，旣得房金，又能代看大門，使盜賊無法覬覦，豈不是一得而兩便。</p>
<p>桑阿强的裁縫舖就設在人家的牆門間裏。姓夏的以前是他的老主顧，現在成了他的房東了。夏姓是本城的大族，即以這屋主的一支而言，就有嫡親弟兄五房。桑阿强的房東是第二房，與其他四房早已分炊。夏二老爺名呌仲南，兄弟中要算他最是能幹，掙的家私也算他最多。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c218">紅髮女郎大鬧攝影塲 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 遜南</p>
<p>紅髮女郎克萊拉寳、天性不羈自幼卽然、這次福斯公司請她拍「野性」CallHerSavage）一片，亦係利用她這一點跳蕩不檢的天性。不意妙人妙事，她有一天在攝影塲中，大發雌威，同一位女配角扭打起來。恐怕這一幕將來弄假成眞，或許竟作爲「野性」中的有趣的穿插。因爲眞一躉、兩個女性這種你一拳，我一脚的兇鬥，非兩個極潑辣，仇恨極深的女子不辦，又非逢到爭風吃醋的勾當不興。所以導演先到逢到這種異乎尋常的表演，怎肯輕輕放過呢？</p>
<p>事情是這樣的；這一天是拍極緊張的一幕。在這一躉裏，克萊拉應當在一個跳舞塲裏碰見她的對方泰爾瑪塔德，（Ｔbelma　Todd）她們應當一言不合地爭論對打起來。不過這個都是戲文，不是眞的，所以克萊拉同泰爾瑪都一心一意的按照戲文上去做，但是她兩人各存私心，要稍稍出些風頭。泰爾瑪後來和人講；「這一叚是我在全片之中難得出風頭的機會，所以我怎肯放鬆。」</p>
<p>這就是兩人認眞扭打的所以然了。克萊拉是何等樣人，她豈能讓人。况且她又日這片子的主角，所以更没有饒讓人的地步。所以等到泰爾瑪安心要個人出風頭的時候，她亦不表演了。就糾信了泰爾瑪打起交手仗來。</p>
<p>泰爾瑪事後說：「我亦不知道打得怎樣利害。不過我後來覺得我的頭髮，被她扭去了一大把。一回兒，我的手裏亦有一大團紅毛。後來我掮起脚來，很命地踢過去，她就倒在地下不動了。」</p>
<p>克萊拉這回吃大虧了。她肚子上受了泰爾瑪一脚。傷勢如何，她亦不肯自已承認。聽說她事後給泰爾瑪寫了一封信，信裏說「我們後會有期吧」，但是福斯公司方面極端否認。</p>
<p>當她們二人，打得難分難所，落花流水的當兒，忙壞了攝影師，急壞了導演先生。</p>
<p>導演迭倫先生如狂如醉的拉了攝影師問：「你拍進去没有？」</p>
<p>「自然，但是好像不是我有意拍的，我祇覺得我的手，自已會自動的搖個不休。我亦眞忘其所以了。」</p>

<p>丨福斯，烏發與高蒙</p>
<p>美國福斯影片公司與德國烏發影片公司，現在已到相同的地步，雙方將正式聯合出品，這聯合的意義是並非烏發歸併與福斯，亦不是福斯歸併與烏發，不過是製片工作上以及藝術上和明星交換上合作吧了。同時，烏發與福斯同英國倫敦的高蒙Ｇaumount　Ｂritisb影片公司亦發生了關係，因此高蒙也許亦混入一起。</p>
<p>福斯與高蒙合作，亦曾煞費口舌，在若干時間之前美國派拉蒙首先與高蒙當局進得合作談判，經過數月的磋商，終於破裂。福斯在派拉蒙取銷前議之後；便乘隙直入，很簡易地解决了這問題。</p>
<p>福斯與烏發，對於他們作品的合作，守着絶對的秘密，到今還不肯公開的宣佈。烏發公司代表伊烈克撲滿Erich　Pommer往來歐美，也輕易不肯告人。此次奔走接洽的除了撲滿君之外，還有安第但文Andre　Davin，他是往返於巴黎製片經理。又據傳說，福斯烏發合作的出品，將在巴黎攝製。此外，麗琳哈蕙Ｂilian　Ｈarvey最近加入福斯，便是烏發滿意福斯方面的先聲。</p>
<p>這事全部是由烏發主動，他們歷年來曾向美國各公司磋商一種可以得到美國方面經濟扶助的辦法。因爲烏發方面感覺到與其攝取英國副本Ｖersion（按各國影片在外國每攝取該國言語之副本）無寗攝美國副本。烏發高蒙的合作品，在美國開演之後，已給予他們很大的經騐。倘與美國合作，用他們在柏靈的攝影塲的人才與設備，不難有極佳的作品產生，成績旣精，更不難在美國市塲佔一</p>
<p>漉江攝現代贈</p>
<p>部份雄厚的勢力了。最先烏發公司想聘請美國的編劇以及幾位美國的明星到德國去，照此辦法當然可以受美國的歡迎。但是烏發公司的董事會否决這計劃，認爲代價太昂。在福斯的立塲上，與烏發合作，經濟方面亦極合算，因爲福斯公司倘不合作，他們必須在德國攝取副本，而與烏發競爭，（各公司皆如此的），否則祇有放棄這市塲。如今互相合作，所費旣廉而效力更佳。且可最先與德國攝影塲的各種技術相媾通了。</p>

<p>卡洛夫的命運，千而人郎却乃因表演工作過於勞苦而死。然而在最近一年以來，好萊塢却又發現了一顆與郎却乃作風相同的銀星，即保里斯卡洛夫。他自主演科學怪人後，聲譽鵲起，但是我們應當知道，凡是飾郎却乃卡洛夫所常常扮演的這一美形裝怪異的角色時，大都須有極大忍耐性，纔足以抵抗長時期軀體上勉强做作的痛苦。卡洛夫最近主演『木乃伊』一片時，用很長的布帶緊緊縳着工作，至每小時之久。</p>
<p>卡洛夫的摰友常常勸卡洛夫表演時設法少做些勞苦的工作，但是他與郎却乃一樣，對之緘口不言。在他以爲假使能扮演得適合劇中人身分，似乎絶不感覺到自已軀體的痛苦。然而在不久的將來，恐怕他的肌肉將終於不能再忍受這種强制的做作。到那時，影壇上勢必又要多添一位犧牲者了。</p>

<p>「不過我們到什麽地方去找四千萬的現欵呢？」</p>
<p>保羅將肩膀一聳，不慌不忙地說道：</p>
<p>「我將這些意大利國庫券到紐約坦街，還怕賣不出錢來嗎？」</p>
<p>「意大利國庫券··········意大利國庫券？」愛立克很驚訝似的說。「你不是老早，就覿掉了嗎？」</p>

<p>Mediation Breakdown: Japan Should Bear the Responsibility</p>
<p>Reply More Demanding</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen, due to Japan's reply not arriving, has postponed its meeting until tomorrow afternoon (7:00 PM "Geneva Time" on the 20th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese representative Yosuke Matsuoka today sent an informal suggestion to the Committee of Nineteen. The committee believes this is a tentative trick by Matsuoka to refuse negotiations and rejected discussing it. (7:40 PM on the 20th, Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Nineteen is scheduled to meet at 5:00 PM this afternoon. It is expected that Tokyo's reply will arrive by then. It is widely believed that Japan's reply will not directly refuse but will offer the appearance of an agreement that can be established. Although discussions may continue, the Committee of Nineteen intends to ask the Japanese representative to provide concrete explanations on the following three points: 1) Will Japan acknowledge the Lytton Report based on its historical background? 2) Will Japan accept Article 15 of the Covenant as the basis for mediation? 3) Will Japan accept the guidance of the advisory committee in the resolution? If the Committee of Nineteen receives satisfactory answers, the mediation process will continue. Some members of the Committee of Nineteen are indeed apprehensive about the consequences of adopting Section 4 of Article 15 of the Covenant. They want to know what results will arise from the preparation of the report, what kind of responsibility will be placed on the League of Nations, and what repercussions it will have on the Far Eastern situation. Their apprehension stems from a lack of confidence, fearing that taking this risk may lead to serious responsibility. With this apprehension, the idea of proceeding with the mediation process becomes even stronger. There may be disputes over who originated the so-called Drummond Plan. Drummond also denies being the author. It is said that Drummond will issue another statement this afternoon to clarify. According to Drummond's own claim, Japanese official Sugimura consulted with him on a draft proposal and asked if certain revisions would be acceptable. However, it is reported that last night, the Japanese side submitted what they called notes of discussions between Sugimura and Drummond to Chairman Hymans. This kind of debate does not involve the nature of an important dispute but only concerns Drummond's personal position. Newspapers and some members of the committee are criticizing Drummond, accusing him of overstepping his authority. (Reuters dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to sources, our representatives to the League of Nations, Yan Huiqing and Gu Weijun, sent a long telegram to Nanjing at noon stating that the Committee of Nineteen does not intend to include the two items applied for by our country—denial of "Manchukuo" and confirmation of Japan's violation of the Covenant—in the resolution. However, they plan to add textual supplements to the explanatory memorandum of the resolution based on the amendments proposed by the Chinese government. They also stated that the League of Nations asks for our special understanding that Japan accepts the entire resolution except for the item of not inviting the U.S. and Russia to participate in the mediation committee, and with regard to the item of denying "Manchukuo," they hope our side will make appropriate concessions, temporarily reserving this point and submitting it to the mediation committee for discussion. In response, the Foreign Ministry has telegraphed our representatives, stating that even if the Committee of Nineteen cannot make a decision to deny the puppet state of Manchukuo created by Japan, our side must still persist to the end at the League of Nations General Assembly next month.

<h3 id="e4">Japanese Government Sends Reply Instructing Revision of Various Points <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, the Japanese Foreign Ministry received the full text of Yosuke Matsuoka's request for instructions. A cabinet meeting was convened immediately to decide on the content of the instructions. At noon, a telegram was sent to Matsuoka, stating that the Committee of Nineteen's removal of the invitation to the U.S. and Russia cannot be regarded as a concession by the League of Nations to Japan but can only be regarded as handling matters in accordance with the charter. Other requests to the League of Nations for revision will still be made according to the instructions of December 17 of last year. The contents of the revisions are as follows:</p>
<p>First Resolution: 1) The wording of the Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact must be removed; 2) The new committee should be organized by the five countries of Britain, France, Germany, Italy, and Belgium, and its name should be the Small Committee; 3) The authority of the Small Committee should be limited to promoting direct Sino-Japanese negotiations; 4) The sentences in Chapters 9 and 10 of the Lytton Report should be changed to: "The principles in Chapter 9 can be used as a reference in some respects."</p>
<p>Second Resolution: Delete the word "fair." Reasoning Document: 1) The reasoning document should be changed to a chairman's declaration, and the content should be revised based on the revised points of the resolution; 2) Restrict the unconditional adoption of the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report and soften the expression of non-recognition of "Manchukuo" in the last item. The imperial representative may also issue a declaration of opposition to this. The Japanese Foreign Ministry's demands are consistently aimed at carrying out its delaying tactics, attempting to reverse the mediation process of the Committee of Nineteen back to the state of December 16 of last year. (China United Press dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) On the 20th, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following reply instructions to the Japanese delegation: 1) The League of Nations is still at the stage of studying the mediation procedure under Article 15, Section 3 of the Covenant. The delegation is expected to continue negotiations. 2) The new committee deliberating the Sino-Japanese problem, regardless of its form, must not invite the U.S. and Russia to participate in the meeting. 3) Strive to demand changes to the old resolution on the following points: Change the reasoning document of the resolution to a chairman's declaration and delete the section denying the Manchurian regime in the last item; change the mediation committee of the first resolution to a guarantee committee to help facilitate direct Sino-Japanese negotiations; and implement the opposition to the new committee adopting the entire Lytton Report.

<p>Advocating for Compulsory Mediation by the League of Nations</p>
<p>(Geneva) The British proposed to agree on a compromise resolution for the Committee of Nineteen and to allow Japan to declare reservations regarding the original draft, but the small countries all opposed, claiming that if there are reservations, it cannot be called a compromise. Therefore, regardless of what kind of compromise plan the League of Nations adopts, both China and Japan must accept it. Some representatives of several countries expect the Committee of Nineteen to proceed with the issue of invoking Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant on Friday, but the remaining representatives advocate not making important decisions until British Foreign Secretary Simon returns from London. Simon is expected to return to Geneva around Tuesday. (National News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Representatives of various small countries, including Ireland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Spain, all advocate for the use of Article 15, Section 4 of the Covenant to force mediation.

<p>(Geneva) The letter to Chairman Hymans prepared by the heads of the Japanese delegation at a meeting on the evening of the 19th was originally scheduled to be sent on the morning of the 20th, but the plan was suddenly changed to transmit it to Chairman Hymans at 11:00 PM on the 19th for a report to the Committee of Nineteen on the afternoon of the 20th. If the Japanese government's reply instructions have not arrived before the committee meeting, the meeting will become a formality, and the main representatives of various countries will likely not attend, only sending representatives.

<p>The Time Has Not Yet Matured for Russia and Japan to Conclude a Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<p>Unwilling to Be Interfered with by Any Country in the Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japanese Foreign Minister Yasuya Uchida announced the principles of Japanese diplomacy to Japanese reporters at 6:00 PM today as follows: The Committee of Nineteen is gradually approaching Japan's position. The Foreign Ministry has instructed its representatives to intensify their activities. There is no need to be pessimistic about the future of the Sino-Japanese dispute. The League of Nations will ultimately accept Japan's demands. At present, there is no need to withdraw from the League of Nations. As for concluding a non-aggression treaty with Russia, Japan believes that the time has not yet matured. In addition to explaining this in detail to the Russian ambassador, with Ambassador Ota taking office in the Russian capital, Japan believes that the most important thing is for the organization committee of Russia, Japan, and "Manchukuo" to resolve border and defense issues. This item is being actively negotiated with Russia. In the future, Japanese diplomacy will naturally take Japan's interests as its position in dealing with world diplomacy and absolutely does not want to be interfered with or hindered by any country. Regarding the China issue, it is deeply hoped that all countries can help China create a strong government, and then a new treaty between China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" can reorganize the peace in the Far East after the September 18th Incident.

The Seiyukai, Minseito, and National Socialist Party all held executive meetings today. The presidents of each party gave inspiring speeches. Seiyukai President Suzuki's speech was roughly as follows: Today is Japan's most difficult time. We cannot obtain the understanding of European and American countries from afar, nor can we obtain the sympathy of China from nearby. Due to the Shanhaiguan Incident, the Sino-Japanese problem will become more complicated in the future, and its resolution will become more difficult. I sincerely hope that my party comrades will make a final effort to break through this difficult time. Minseito President Wakatsuki's speech was roughly as follows: Although the League of Nations' attitude towards us recently has been commendable, it is regrettable that many countries cannot understand Japan, so that China often sways the League. We deeply regret this. As for the domestic panic, we firmly believe that it can be remedied by the implementation of civil engineering projects. However, the sharp decline in the yen's exchange rate is greatly related to the country's economic credit, which we must pay close attention to. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Popular Morale Amid National Crisis <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>Last year, at the outset of the September 18th Incident in the Northeast, students and youths across the country were stirred and expressed their determination to defend the nation and resist aggression, even at the cost of their lives. We were deeply gratified, believing that external threats had awakened our seemingly listless nation, injecting it with vitality. With such morale and vigor, China would not perish. However, with the renewed fall of Yu Pass and the emergency in North China, the news we received was not of students and youths in Peiping and Tientsin uniting to prepare for resisting the invaders, but rather of "early vacations" and "ice-skating entertainment," a series of bizarre occurrences. As the national crisis deepens and the nation teeters on the brink of collapse, now is precisely the time for our people to endure hardship, steel themselves, and prepare to make sacrifices. Yet, students and youths, who are the backbone of society and the future masters of the country, are either seeking entertainment or evading danger for personal comfort, fully revealing a cowardly and complacent mentality. The aggressors are not to be feared, nor even the fall of the nation; what is truly to be feared is this cowardly and complacent mentality, like swallows building nests on curtains, unaware of the impending danger, or fish lying on a chopping board, awaiting slaughter with eyes closed. This is the incurable disease that will lead to the demise of our nation. Faced with enormous difficulties, they remain unmoved. As the aggressors enter the country, they only know to flee death. Those who used to criticize others are now following the same path. Those students who are ice-skating and fleeing death, try to reflect in silence, can you truly feel no shame in your hearts? However, we do not wish to place blame solely on the students. Since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, which has lasted for over a year, the authorities in charge have never failed to declare their determination and preparedness to resist aggression to our people. Yet, in reality, the situation remains one of no fighting and no retreat. Moreover, factions within the party are divided, and warlords continue to engage in endless conflicts. The government has failed to demonstrate to the people a firm attitude, clear facts, and a unified goal, to rally the divided national spirit, establish a central belief, and concentrate the scattered forces, so that popular morale can be strengthened and the people's spirit can be anchored. Instead, they procrastinate and wait, hoping to seize opportunities to die for the country. As a result, the surging popular morale weakens and then disappears. The timid sink into complacency, while the audacious take risks for their own gratification. Thus, it is inevitable that some students in Peiping and Tientsin are either enjoying themselves ice-skating or fleeing for safety, while others are resorting to radical actions such as throwing bombs and sending warning letters. Therefore, it would be unfair to solely blame the students and youths for the decline in popular morale today.</p>

<p>Japanese Side Implements Dumping Policy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Business sources report that after the sharp depreciation of the Japanese currency, the cost of Japanese goods has decreased, and Japan is now implementing a dumping policy in China. Tens of thousands of tons of goods have arrived in China one after another. In the past two months, businesses have outwardly expressed their refusal to sell inferior goods due to the warnings of patriotic groups, but in reality, they are secretly accepting them, and the amount is no less than before. Goods such as cotton textiles, hardware, seafood, stationery, and coal are still being imported in large quantities every month, using both dumping and distribution methods. In the past two months, the amount has consistently been over ten million tons. Taking electric light bulbs as an example, Japan is implementing a dumping policy in China. Recent investigations have revealed that approximately 600,000 light bulbs are being dumped in Shanghai, Hankou, and North China each month, with each bulb selling for only seven to nine cents. This price is two-thirds to three-quarters lower than other foreign goods and one-half to two-thirds lower than domestic goods. Recently, they have also been imitating the products of Western merchants, causing domestic goods to be hit hard, and their sales are almost completely replaced. (20th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Resumption of the Japanese Parliament</p>
<h3 id="e77">The Saito Cabinet in a Difficult Situation <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: The parliament is scheduled to reconvene on the 21st. The Saito Cabinet, facing unprecedented internal and external difficulties centered on the Manchurian issue, is being ignored by the Seiyukai. Even the Minseito, which considers itself a party in alliance with the government, has recently shown signs of changing direction. National unity exists only in name. Therefore, the trend after the resumption of parliament is highly noteworthy. At the beginning of the session, Prime Minister Saito will deliver a speech on policy direction, Foreign Minister Uchida will speak on diplomacy, and Finance Minister Takahashi will speak on finance. Then, a questioning battle will unfold. The first lineup of the Seiyukai, Minseito, and Kokumin Domei factions is as follows: The Seiyukai will have Hamada Kunimatsu as the first to question general policy, followed by Okuchi Kiroku on financial issues, Uchida Shinya on national defense issues, Ashida Hitoshi on diplomatic issues, Kogure Butafu on economic issues, Tajiri Kazumin on current affairs issues, To Takeo on rural issues, and Miyazawa Yutaka on ideological issues. All are selected elites who will attack the government head-on. The Minseito will have Kawasaki Katsu raise financial issues as the vanguard, followed by Matsumoto Tadao on diplomatic issues and Nomura Karoku on ideological issues. The Kokumin Domei, from the standpoint of a purely opposition party, will have Nakano Seigo on diplomatic issues, Kiyose Ichiro on general politics, and Nonaka Tetsuya on exchange rate issues, launching a fierce attack. The questioners from the House of Peers have been decided as follows: on the essence of national politics and civil administration, Araki Yoshinori Count (Research Society); on financial, educational, and humanitarian issues, Ki Toshihide Baron (Kosei Society); on national defense issues, Mizuno Shigejiro; on financial, economic, and military affairs, Kato Masanosuke (Doseikai).</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: The Kokumin Domei held a general meeting of Diet members at its headquarters yesterday afternoon as a substitute for the party convention. President Adachi delivered a speech on the party's attitude towards the parliament as follows: The senile and incompetent current cabinet has intensified the anxieties of this extraordinary time and is daily creating the causes for a major collapse in the future. We [omission in original] hope for national unity, [omission in original] its own [omission in original] relaxed state, [omission in original] to rescue [omission in original] the trend [omission in original] against Japan's expectations. The debate in the League of Nations has degenerated into a formality, [omission in original] the essence of diplomacy is gradually moving towards direct action in the Far East. The recent anti-Japanese actions in China cannot be said to be unrelated to such an international atmosphere. We must have a resolute determination in the League of Nations debate and in essential diplomacy. The current cabinet's financial plan is [omission in original] separated and fractured. The feeling that the economy is improving is merely a delusion due to the depreciation of the exchange rate.</p>

<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: The parliament will reconvene tomorrow. The Seiyukai and Minseito each held party conventions today to clarify their attitudes towards the parliament to the world. The Seiyukai held a general meeting at its headquarters at 2:00 PM. President Suzuki and other officers and party members attended. President Suzuki was elected as chairman. After passing the declaration, the executive committee was elected. President Suzuki gave an encouraging speech. The Minseito held a general meeting at Seiyo-ken in Ueno at 1:00 PM. A declaration and resolution were passed, advocating four major policies: finance, currency, exchange rate, and industrial control. President Wakatsuki also delivered a speech on the party's attitude towards the parliament.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Summary of Wakatsuki's Speech <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>▲ Dentsu, Tokyo, 20th: The main points of President Wakatsuki's speech at the Minseito general meeting held at Seiyo-ken in Ueno at 1:00 PM this afternoon are as follows: 1. The discussions in the League of Nations by smaller countries are not something to be overjoyed or worried about. With an unwavering belief, we should aim to reach the true conclusion of the issue. 2. In the state of gold export prohibition, the easily fallen into evils are excessive currency inflation, which raises prices, threatens the lives of the people, disrupts creditor-debtor relations, and destroys the credit system, leading the financial world to collapse. This is what European countries experienced after the war. Therefore, the government and the people should be vigilant and not repeat this mistake. 3. The outline of the budget plan has already been published. There are huge expenditures, and the interest payments on public bonds still rely on the issuance of public bonds. This is, of course, an extraordinary abnormality in the financial plan and is deeply worrying. In the future, the interest on public bonds should be paid from permanent sources of revenue, seize the opportunity to achieve low interest rates, and attempt to swap to low-interest national bonds is necessary. 4. It is an urgent task at present to curb the fluctuations in the exchange rate and devise emergency measures to achieve moderate stability. 5. A part of the world blames the current economic turmoil on the economic structure. Although the current economic structure has some evils, its foundation is not wrong. Therefore, the state should guide and implement appropriate controls on production and sales. 6. The greatest worries of the nation and society today are the agitation of national thought and social unrest. Therefore, I firmly believe that rejecting dangerous thoughts, guiding wrong thoughts, and stabilizing people's hearts are urgent tasks today. Therefore, it is necessary to establish the authority of the parliament, and improvements should be made in the operation of the administration and the exercise of judicial power. 7. It is regrettable that there are those who deny constitutional politics, even if the scope is small. The so-called advocacy of dictatorship and oligarchy is theoretically, historically, and practically worthless.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 20th: The Minseito and Seiyukai will both publish resolutions on domestic and foreign policy when parliament opens this afternoon. The Minseito resolution states that Japan must adopt a firm attitude towards the Manchurian dispute in accordance with international justice, and the people should have a common and united front on this issue. The resolution states that Japan's attitude towards the Manchurian dispute is based on safeguarding peace in the Far East, which is recognized by members of the League of Nations. It also states that Japan's attitude towards the Manchurian issue will not change under any circumstances or under any external pressure. It hopes that the people will proceed calmly in this national crisis. The resolution also states the need to restore constitutionality as soon as possible.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Tokyo, 20th: The Japanese Diet will resume tomorrow after the New Year recess, which is attracting national attention. The Seiyukai and Minseito both held general meetings this afternoon, which were well attended, to decide on the party program for this session. Although only 33 parliamentarians openly oppose the government, it is generally expected that it will not be easy for the government to obtain large sums of money to balance its budget. The Seiyukai is the largest party in the Diet, but there are many party members who are prepared to strongly criticize the government, especially Finance Minister Takahashi, even though Takahashi is also a member of the Seiyukai and was once the president of the Seiyukai. However, the Seiyukai's attitude towards the Saito Cabinet is not consistent, [omission in original] which is a weakness on the opposition's side, because many people in the Seiyukai believe that the current period is a time of national crisis and it is not appropriate to have party strife. Public sentiment in Japan generally believes that the current Prime Minister is doing a reasonably good job in handling domestic and foreign affairs. The angry and frenzied image of a few months ago, which led to assassination attempts and other violent acts, seems to have largely dissipated. It is generally expected that such violent acts will not occur during the current Diet session. According to [omission in original] politicians' opinions, if Saito is [omission in original], then the political [omission in original] or may [omission in original], even [omission in original] the whole country, [omission in original] give extreme opposition parties and fanatics [omission in original] an opportunity. The Japanese people do not have much confidence in the Diet. At a time when the hardships of the people have not diminished, and the rural areas are particularly [omission in original] difficult, pushing [omission in original] the government and plunging the country into danger will [omission in original] make radical elements rampant. [omission in original] Prefecture still has the support of the people, or it will not fail. However, some people in the Seiyukai hope that the government can be reorganized without causing a major political upheaval and achieve a purely party cabinet. Future fierce battles will focus on the budget plan, which will be difficult for the government to defend. It is also expected that disturbances will occur in the House of Representatives, but the authorities have already considered special precautions to deal with such incidents.</p>

<p>National Defense Research Associations Established Throughout the Country</p>
<p>▲ Rengo Tsushin, Tokyo, 20th: Last year, more than 7,000 left-wing elements were arrested on suspicion of Reddening movements. The police authorities are extremely alarmed by the strong base of the Kigen and are especially focusing their efforts on the youth training programs of the Army Ministry, which attaches great importance to the Reddening of soldiers. The Army Ministry is determined to actively carry out a major mobilization on the ideological front. According to the Army Ministry's plan, National Defense Research Associations will be established in major cities in each prefecture and county throughout the country. These associations will transcend political parties and factions, promote the national spirit, guide thought, guide local young men and women, study national defense, and provide relief to wounded soldiers. The governors of each prefecture and county or powerful individuals will serve as guides.</p>
<p>Members will include students, young men and women's groups, police officers, veterans, merchants, industrialists, farmers, and all other classes. Currently, twenty prefectures and counties, including Kumamoto and Fukuoka, have already organized these associations. The Army Ministry plans to extend this movement to all universities and vocational schools throughout the country, with each school organizing a National Defense Research Association. Keio University in Tokyo will be the first to organize the Keio University National Defense Research Association at 1:00 PM on the 20th. It is reported that when these research associations are established throughout the country, the number of members will reach 20 million, which can prevent the intrusion of Reddening thought. The Army authorities are earnestly hoping for its future development.</p>

<h3 id="e85">World Economic Conference <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Preparatory Committee Publishes Report</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 19th: The preparatory committee for the World Economic Conference has completed the agenda for the conference tonight. The World Economic Conference, as decided by the League of Nations Executive Council, will be convened in London. The date of the convocation is yet to be determined. The organizing group is scheduled to meet on January 25th. The preparatory committee has prepared a general report for it. The committee explained the seriousness of the situation, the chaos of currency, the fall of prices, and the reduction of trade, but also pointed out considerable signs of improvement. The preparatory committee declared that the debts between governments, which have not been resolved for a long time, are an insurmountable obstacle to economic and financial recovery. Therefore, negotiations should be started and resolved as soon as possible. The preparatory committee also pointed out the main issues that countries should study: 1. Restore the real monetary standard between countries. 2. Use low-interest policies to facilitate the healthy development of various industries. 3. Supervising the surplus exchange rate is a key condition for the recovery of various industries. Governments should study the possibility of rapidly restoring the freedom of exchange rates and adopt strategies that can recirculate the capital that is currently stagnant. 4. Special commercial obstacles caused by economic panic should be abolished as soon as possible, that is, abolishing import quantity restrictions and easing tariff policies. The preparatory committee concluded in this part of its report, saying that efforts towards commercial freedom are directly related to stable currency. To maintain an international monetary system without basing it on an international economic system is impossible.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 19th: The report of the Preparatory Committee for the World Economic Conference, published today, advocates that the governments of the world should immediately start working to restore the normal exchange of goods. Countries should do their best to find a universal agreement to gradually release temporary emergency plans implemented during trade panic, such as banning imports and restricting import quotas, in order to finally completely abolish them. The World Economic Conference may not be able to convene until May at the earliest. Although the silver issue is included in the agenda, this report does not pay attention to the position of silver in the world currency system. The report believes that any behavior that raises prices and gold prices can benefit silver and other low-priced goods.</p>

<p>▲ Reuters, Paris, 19th: French President Lebrun informed the government that he is willing to reduce his salary by [omission in original] percent. The House Finance Committee today voted 24 to 11 to consider the budget plan proposed by the Socialist Party and to base its discussion on the government's plan. The result of this move seems to be a major change to the government's proposal, because the government's proposal is very unpopular and has harmed the position of the Pongouin cabinet.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Sichuan's Two Lius Suddenly Cooperate Again <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Since the Jing Conference Implemented a Truce</p>
<p>Both Sides, Exhausted, Know Retreating is Difficult</p>
<p>The Battle of Chengdu is About to Reignite</p>
<p>According to Chongqing dispatches, following the conclusion of the Neijiang Conference, many rumors have arisen in Sichuan. The most noteworthy is the news that Liu Wenhui has turned his guns around to counterattack Deng and Tian's forces. Because Liu's counterattack on Rongwei failed and resulted in heavy losses, he sought another way out, first seeking peace with the 21st Army, expressing his willingness to unconditionally cease the great war in southern Sichuan, and requesting Liu Xiang not to press him further. He prepared to reorganize his forces and strike out towards Xinjin, Shuangliu, Renshou, and Meishan, to seize the territory of the 28th and 29th Armies. Thus, the voices of cooperation between the two Lius spread like thunder for a time.</p>
<p>Conditions for Cooperation Between the Two Lius: The cooperation between the two Lius was initiated by generals Leng Zhendong, Tian Boshi, and Du Shaoshang of the 24th Army, who went to Zijing to meet with Liu Xiang and discuss cooperation methods. After repeated consultations, it is said that four cooperation measures were agreed upon: (1) The 21st and 24th Armies should cease fire immediately; (2) The 24th Army should not interfere with the 21st Army's occupation of the 24th Army's defense zone; (3) The 21st Army should not assist in any attacks on any part of the Allied forces by the 24th Army; (4) The 24th Army should not launch any further counterattacks against the 21st Army. Liu Xiang, considering that the four measures were of little significance, agreed to sign them. He believed that since his army had set out, the benefits he had gained were better than those of other armies. Although the 24th Army had been defeated, its vitality had not yet been lost. If they only knew to fight to the death, it would be impossible to predict who would win. It would be better to take advantage of the victory and withdraw, doing a favor to the 24th Army by agreeing to their request. After the truce conference between the two sides was completed, Liu Xiang returned to Chongqing from the Zijing headquarters on the 12th. The areas of Jiading, Jingyan, and Renshou counties were then designated as buffer zones. Both sides still left a small number of troops to guard the front line, each fifty miles apart, with the rest moving to the rear.</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui's Army Returns to Chengdu: Liu Wenhui of the 24th Army collected the remaining troops and reorganized them into ten mixed brigades, each brigade stipulated to have 10,000 men. The insufficient numbers were to be expanded within a limited time. However, Liu, being situated in a corner of upper southern Sichuan, half of which was a barren and impoverished area, found the army's pay to be quite a problem. Liu privately planned to station the troops in Yaan, Ningyuan, and western Kangding, to nurture their strength and await the opportunity to stage a comeback. However, as the end of the old year approached and the weather turned cold, the borderlands were covered with snow, and everything above Yaan became another world. The soldiers of this unit, whose daily lives had been more comfortable than those of other units, suddenly heard of being moved to the borderlands, where they would suffer from hunger and cold in the icy and snowy conditions. Therefore, before the order was even issued, they had already risen in opposition. Liu had no choice but to convene a military conference of all officers in Meishan to discuss the army's future. The subordinate generals all believed that the province's revenue was quite extensive, and that the unconditional surrender to the 28th and 29th Armies last time was only to maintain the status quo. Now that they had signed non-aggression treaties with the 20th Army, there was no need to worry about the rear. They should return to the province and take over all the institutions, and since Deng and Tian's forces were weak, they dared not resist. Otherwise, they should use all their strength to eliminate the 28th and 29th Armies to vent their anger over the defeat. Liu agreed and led his troops back to the province, issuing a telegram from Meishan announcing his return to the province, saying: "Since Sichuan lost control, wars have been frequent, and soldiers have never had a peaceful year. What crime have the people of Sichuan committed, suffering repeatedly from military disasters? The thought of the children left behind burns in my heart. This sudden outbreak of flames spread like wildfire, and urgent dispatches flew back and forth, causing national uproar. Day and night, I feel deeply guilty. Wenhui, as a soldier, has always been wary of resorting to military force and has worked hard to maintain peace from beginning to end. In the early stages of the brewing war, I suffered immense pain and repeatedly made concessions, hoping to avoid disputes. This sincere intention has been seen by all. After all, the chaos in Sichuan cannot be resolved by military force. To seek the root cause and purify the source, the first step is to govern according to law. If chaos is used to replace chaos, if something is taken or lost, the tangled threads will become more chaotic, and seeking the source will only exhaust it. Then the long night will have no end. This intention has already been presented in detail to the central government and conveyed to the elders in the province, and there is no need to repeat it. I hope it is understood. I am also grateful to the elders of the province, as well as the institutions and organizations, for running around and shouting at the top of their lungs, hoping to eliminate the chaos and achieve peace. Who knew that their good intentions would not be understood, and the more they tried to be patient, the more they were invaded. Defensive action was truly unavoidable. The battle of Chengdu, with fierce fighting for days, frustrated their power and was unavoidable. The elders and brothers were again subjected to the suffering of war. Thinking back to the past, there is still pain. The battle of Rongwei lasted for more than ten days, with blood shed on the battlefield and countless casualties. The loss of military supplies was even more immeasurable. In addition, the people, already exhausted, suffered the burden of heavy supplies, and the devastation was heartbreaking. If this continues, how will it end? Therefore, we temporarily resolved to cease fire, restore peace, and jointly plan for the aftermath, using the available military strength to save the nation's foundation, which is on the verge of collapse. I hope to live up to my private intentions and give the people a chance to rest, dispel the clouds, and see the light. This is what all the elders and brothers in Sichuan have been longing for. Wenhui, having mistakenly assumed the provincial government during a time of many troubles, felt responsible for suppressing the chaos. He left the province to supervise the army, and the military life was hurried. Now that the war has subsided and everything is waiting to be rebuilt, I plan to return to Chengdu to discuss governance. However, I have heard rumors that the provincial capital is still in turmoil. Since I released the prisoners first, would they repay kindness with revenge? They have not lost their conscience, and I don't think they would do such a thing. If, because Wenhui left the province, they occupied my military and government institutions, burned my officers' residences, massacred my wounded soldiers, and robbed my personnel left in the province, they are uneasy and fear revenge. So they pretend to be virtuous and cause alarm. However, Wenhui, as a soldier, would never resort to violence to replace violence, indulging in barbarism. I have strictly ordered my subordinates not to violate them in the slightest. If anyone deliberately violates this order, they will be killed immediately. If they think that everyone is easy to deal with, are brave and call themselves soldiers, and do not care about harming the local area and burdening my elders and brothers, Wenhui has no choice but to deal with them temporarily in order to maintain the overall situation. I feel that my talent is inadequate to meet the heavy responsibilities and cannot prevent problems before they arise, nor can I stop the war once it has started. I have failed to live up to the central government's trust and the people's expectations. Thinking about this at midnight, I am saddened and tears stream down my face. Looking forward, I am filled with many feelings. I plan to return to my post soon to pacify the people. Peace and governance depend on renewal. I hope that all the elders and brothers in Sichuan will come forward to teach me. Liu Wenhui bows."</p>
<p>Five Elders and Seven Worthies Mediate: After Liu's telegram was issued, the people in Chengdu were panic-stricken, startled several times a night, thinking that the great war was about to resume and that the people would suffer the hardship of war again. At the same time, Liu Wenhui's advance troops had moved to the front lines of Xinjin and Shuangliu, only forty miles from Chengdu. Liu Wenhui himself had also arrived in Xinjin, and the situation was extremely serious. Deng Xihou and Tian Songyao were even more panicked. In addition to the two armies deploying heavy troops to Qinglongchang, Shiyangchang, and Hongpailou (all more than ten miles from Chengdu) to prevent Liu's army from returning to the province, the Five Elders and Seven Worthies of Chengdu (respected elders from all over Sichuan) came forward to mediate, hoping to avoid the resumption of war. But what the future holds is still unknown. (January 16)</p>
<p>Qingdao is the Main Hub for the Import of Japanese Goods</p>
<h3 id="e89">Daily Transactions Exceed 10 Million Yuan <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>＝Total Imports Have Increased Several Times Over＝</p>
<p>＝Nine Chinese Merchants Cooperating with Japanese Merchants＝</p>
<p>Qingdao Dispatch: Since the September 18th Incident, the entire country has been filled with righteous indignation. However, Qingdao alone remains as peaceful and prosperous as ever, and unscrupulous merchants are even more eager to sell Japanese goods, resulting in the market being flooded with them. According to news from the docks, the total amount of Japanese goods imported through Qingdao recently has increased several times compared to before September 18th. Qingdao has become the main hub for the import of Japanese goods, and even representatives from Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and Guizhou provinces have been sent to Qingdao to order Japanese goods, which is extremely hateful. What is even more hateful is that the Chinese merchants in the exchange (the exchange is nominally a Sino-Japanese joint venture but is actually monopolized by Japanese merchants), who were previously pressured by the Japanese and withdrew from the exchange, organized a Qingdao Municipal Exchange in the Qiyan Guild Hall, dealing in all kinds of silver, money, and goods transactions. Recently, nine unscrupulous merchants, including Fu Judong, have vigorously advocated Sino-Japanese cooperation and resumed business in the exchange on the 14th of this month in order to carry out their pro-foreign behavior. It is said that when Fu Judong and other merchants returned to the exchange to start trading, they first held a meeting at the money and goods exchange, chaired by Ando, the Japanese director, who reported on the process of the Chinese merchants' return to the exchange and stated the rules to be followed in the market thereafter, finally expressing his welcome. Next, Liu Shuheng, the manager of the Chinese merchant Lifenghao, spoke about the benefits of the Chinese merchants returning to the exchange and urged everyone to abide by the rules, conspire for mutual benefit, and not be impulsive or violate the regulations. Anyone who disrupts the market will be punished accordingly. Finally, he wished that Sino-Japanese traders would trade together forever without separation. It is also heard that the Chinese merchants who returned to the exchange this time have extravagant desires and are preparing to complete transactions of more than 10 million yuan with the Japanese side every day. Seeing this situation, the Japanese merchants have hired Wang Weibin, the manager of Xieyuansheng, and Liu Shuheng, the manager of Lifenghao, as consultants to strive to develop the exchange's business. The names of the Chinese merchants who have returned to the exchange, the names of the managers, and the market numbers are listed below:</p>
<p>Number Company Name Manager's Name</p>
<p>34 Fuxingxiang Zou Zengzhi</p>
<p>40 Lifenghao Liu Shuheng</p>
<p>48 Xieyuansheng Wang Weibin</p>
<p>45 Dongshenghe Fei Jingbin</p>

<p>Songjiang: Songxing Distributes Debentures</p>
<p>After the collapse of Songjiang Bank, Qu Yuehua, the lawyer for the bondholders' representative, is in the process of pursuing litigation. Another group of bondholders, represented by Chen Nianci and Mo Wenxiong, through their lawyers Peng Zhongjun and Gu Shouyi, submitted a petition to President Wang of the County Court, stating that it is now the cold end of the year and the Spring Festival requires funds. The bondholders in this group are all small overseas households who are relatively poor. They requested the County Court to be considerate and immediately distribute the funds for their use, and suggested that bondholders with claims of less than 100 yuan should be paid in full, those with claims of less than 200 yuan should be paid 60%, and those with claims of less than 500 yuan should be paid 40%. After the petition was sent to the liquidation office for review and reply, the office has now decided to distribute half a percentage to all bondholders from the funds received from the litigation, with a remaining 2,000 yuan. In addition, 4,000 yuan was returned by the rubber factory to be distributed among the smaller bondholders to show consideration. It is calculated that those with claims of 50 yuan or less will be paid in full, those with claims of less than 100 yuan will be paid 30%, and those with claims of less than 200 yuan will be paid 15%. The payment period will be from the 21st of this month to the 10th of February, and President Wang has issued a public notice to inform everyone.</p>

<p>At the home of a Mr. Zhao at the intersection of Xianqian Street and Zhongxin Street last night (the 19th) at three o'clock, a customer of a vendor selling *tanfen* left embers behind, which ignited rice straw. In an instant, fierce flames soared into the air, spreading to the Xu family. The neighbors cried out in despair, a truly tragic scene. Soon, the fire alarm rang wildly, and fire trucks and police arrived at the scene one after another, doing their best to put out the fire. It is estimated that two storefronts were destroyed, and the Yunjian Commercial Daily was also affected. The fire gradually subsided by dawn.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Eight Communists Arrested and Imprisoned</p>
<p>There is a group called the "Eight Party" in Wuxi, which has been established for three years. Initially, it was known for reporting opium cases. Those who were reported were mostly wealthy and addicted to vices. One of the members, Wei Mei, recently used a calling card to borrow 50 yuan from Wei Guanzhu, a resident of Shafun Dan who was skilled in medicine and addicted to vices. Wei initially ignored the card, but soon Wei sent another letter, with many threatening words. The other day, the county party headquarters suddenly sent a letter to the County Public Security Bureau, stating that Wei was falsely using the name of the National Herald to swindle outside. Detective Shen Dehua was dispatched to arrest Wei at the Park Hotel No. 41 and escort him to the bureau. After questioning, he was transferred to the county government for interrogation and detention.</p>

The members of the ten squads of the third branch of the Jiangjian garrison of the Chamber of Commerce Regiment also saved 50 yuan by tightening their belts and reducing expenses. The year-end reward of 50 yuan for the garrison was also donated at the same time. All were remitted to the Shanghai Volunteer Army Support Association for transfer to the front lines.</p>

The town head of the town discovered this and found four forged seals in Feng's drawer, which were sealed up together at the district office. At the same time, an emergency meeting was convened by the 3rd District Party Headquarters, which resolved to report to the superior party headquarters to have Feng permanently expelled from the party, and to send a letter to the Education Bureau to have Feng dismissed from his post first. At the same time, the victims were ordered to file a criminal lawsuit in court.</p>

Someone gave the following brief talk at the New Pier: According to Guo, the business community in Hong Kong believes that Japan's recent capture of Yuguan is intended to annex our country and is extremely angry. They have the determination to sacrifice and hope that the government will make an early decision on the anti-Japanese plan, showing a true attitude. If the government orders resistance to Japan, the Hong Kong merchants are willing to be the government's support, etc.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Duan Qirui's Reply to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Why Should There Be Any Difference Between the Court and the Opposition in Defending Against Aggression?</p>
<p>In the Past, Force Could Not Subdue Me</p>
<p>How Could Humble Words Tempt Me?</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Local Association, and other organizations recently learned that the Japanese side was greatly enticing both the Duan and Wu factions, falsely claiming that the people should join hands, and trying their best to win them over, releasing an atmosphere of peace to confuse people. They telegraphed Tianjin Duan Zhiqian and Beiping Wu Ziyu, requesting them to refuse to meet with the Japanese and to state their attitude and restrain their old subordinates, not to fall into the trap. After the telegrams were sent, it was discovered that Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, had received a reply telegram from Duan, clearly expressing his attitude towards resisting aggression. The two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce: To Mr. Duan Zhiqian and Mr. Wu Ziyu of Tianjin and Beiping: The Japanese warlords are determined to use the strategy of "using Chinese to destroy Chinese", secretly instigating frustrated military and political figures to be their pawns, and using a small number of troops as their support, hoping to take control of the whole country without bloodshed, trying it in the Northeast and succeeding. Now it is said that they will try it again in North China. The enemy is not to be blamed, what is worrying is that there are still people like Ding Shiyuan in our country for them to use. How can the mistake of Wu Sangui be repeated? Moreover, the Japanese policy of using traitors is more brutal than that of the Qing Dynasty. How can there be a good ending? The generals in the Northeast are still able to escape the cage and not be tempted. Your prestige and history are above them, and you have many old subordinates. Although you are full of righteousness, the Japanese will never forget you. Humble words and generous gifts, and nightly advances, are a matter of fact. I implore you to deal with them with the righteousness of Yan Changshan and Wen Tianxiang, so that their conspiracy can be foiled, and warn your old subordinates not to be used. This spiritual confrontation is ten times more effective than beheading generals and seizing flags. In the past, Gongshan did not comply with the rebels, and he still knew that a gentleman should not besiege his country, let alone you, Ming Gong. I beseech you to issue a declaration quickly, so as to stabilize the people's will. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, bows.</p>
<p>Duan Zhiqian's Reply Telegram: To Chairman Wang of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and forwarded to the Shanghai Municipal Local Association and the Exchange Association: Both telegrams have been read. I am saddened by the national crisis and honored to be encouraged by righteousness. I am determined to dedicate myself to the country and will not lag behind others. Other things should not be mentioned for the time being. In the past, when the whole country was mad about the monarchy, I was still upright and outspoken. Force could not subdue me, how could humble words tempt me? Why should there be any difference between the court and the opposition in defending against aggression? It is my duty and there is no need to promote it. There are many people of insight on the sea who are knowledgeable. Know that eloquence is not as good as facts. Duan Qirui, printed seal.</p>

<p>According to Central News Agency, Wu Dan, Battalion Commander of the Artillery Battalion of the 78th Division of the 19th Route Army, resigned from his post and came to Shanghai to take care of family affairs in preparation for going north to resist the enemy, considering that the lost territories in the Northeast have not yet been recovered, and Yuguan has fallen again, and the situation in North China is becoming increasingly tense. It is learned that Mr. Wu went to the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters yesterday morning at about 9:00 AM to say goodbye to Mayor Wu and Commander Dai, and then took the Shanghai-Nanjing train to Beijing that afternoon, crossed the river and changed trains to go north. According to Mr. Wu, speaking to Central News Agency reporters before leaving, "Defending the country and resisting foreign enemies is a man's duty." This trip is determined to dedicate himself to the country. Such a heroic spirit is truly a model for us. It is also heard that there are more than twenty lower-ranking military officers of the 19th Route Army who are going north to resist Japan with Battalion Commander Wu.</p>
<h3 id="e100">The Righteous Army Relief Society Appeals for Aid for Li and Deng <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Battalions Retreating from Rehe under Ma and Feng</p>
<p>Allocation of Military Supplies and Trucks</p>
<p>The Shanghai Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Society issued four official letters yesterday, all of which are extremely important. They are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Appealing for Aid for Li and Deng: The Society previously received telegrams from Ma Zhanshan and Li Zhongyi requesting assistance. After discussion, it was decided to allocate existing funds for ammunition and cotton clothing to provide practical assistance, and to send letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Northeast Refugee Relief Society to request relief. This was previously reported in the newspaper. Based on the resolution, the Society sent separate letters to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Northeast Refugee Relief Society yesterday stating: Respectfully, We received a telegram from General Zhu Ziqiao stating that Li Zhongyi, the General Commander of the 8th Army Corps of the Righteous Army, due to Ma Zhanshan's departure and the exhaustion of ammunition and aid, had no choice but to select 27,000 elite cavalry and infantry troops and arrive at [blank space], but had no way to raise funds for the men and horses. With limited strength, they had to telegraph requesting prompt relief to show consolation, etc. We also received a genuine telegram from General Wan Fulin through Mr. Wu Huanzhang, the representative of Chairman Ma Zhanshan (as seen in yesterday's telegram), etc. After combining these and discussing them, as the funds donated and stored by our Society are not large, it was decided that in addition to our Society allocating 300,000 rounds of ammunition for the 7.9mm rifle, a relief fund of 10,000 yuan, and 2,000 pieces of cotton blankets and clothing to the various armies retreating from Rehe in Heilongjiang, we would also request your Society and the Northeast Refugee Relief Society (your Society and the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce) to find other ways to provide relief. Therefore, we respectfully request that your Society, mindful of the hardships and tribulations suffered by the Li and Deng troops for over a year, grant them relief so that we can achieve the effect of many hands making light work. We sincerely hope you will investigate and handle this matter, and we are deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Providing Relief to Lao Bei Feng: The Society sent a letter to Mr. Yang Wenfei, the representative of Zhang Haitian (i.e., Lao Bei Feng), stating: Respectfully, It has been resolved at the 98th meeting of our Standing Committee to allocate 100,000 rounds of ammunition for the 7.9mm rifle and a relief fund of 5,000 yuan to the Lao Bei Feng troops, which will be remitted to General Zhu Ziqiao for transfer. We are sending this letter to inform you. Please check and report to your Commander to prepare receipts and receive them from General Zhu for use. Sincerely, to Mr. Yang Wenlong, Representative of Commander Zhang Haitian of the 3rd Corps of the 2nd Army Corps of the Northeast Volunteer Army.</p>
<p>Allocating Cotton Clothing to Zhou Han: The Society sent a letter to Zhou Han, Commander of the 3rd Route Cavalry of the Northeast Anti-Japanese National Salvation Volunteer Army, stating: Respectfully, We received your letter of January 17 stating that you were previously granted cotton blankets and clothing by your Society, which has been communicated to the front lines, and the entire army is overjoyed, requesting prompt allocation so that they can return north as soon as possible, etc. We have approved this. It has been resolved at the 98th meeting of our Standing Committee to allocate 200 sets of cotton clothing. We are sending this letter to inform you. Please check and prepare receipts to collect them from the Society and transport them to the front lines for distribution.</p>
<p>Assisting with Military Trucks: The Society previously received letters from Jiang Songnian and Wu Huanzhang, representatives of Ma Zhanshan, and Pang Yuedong, representative of Feng Zhanhai, requesting assistance in donating trucks to facilitate military transportation, etc. The Society sent a special reply yesterday stating: Respectfully, We received your letter of January 15 stating that the Ma and Feng troops are retreating to the border of Rehe, and transportation is extremely difficult. Please allocate some of the military trucks that our Society has raised funds to purchase to facilitate military operations, etc. We have approved this. According to our Society's previous allocation of 80,000 yuan to purchase one million rounds of ammunition, as the order was inconvenient, we telegraphed General Zhu to request the Ministry of Military Affairs to claim them on our behalf, and then used the funds to purchase military trucks and send them to General Zhu for use. Now that we have received the previous request, it has been resolved to telegraph General Zhu to request a discretionary allocation for use. We sent a telegram to General Zhu on the 19th of this month requesting the allocation, and the original telegram is recorded on a separate sheet for your reference. Sincerely, we hope you will investigate this matter. We also sent a telegram to General Zhu Ziqiao stating: Recently, Pang Quanfeng, representative of Feng Zhanhai, and Wu Huanzhang and Jiang Songnian, representatives of Ma Zhanshan, came to the Society and stated that the Feng and Ma troops, who are currently stationed in the northern part of Rehe, number over 50,000, and transportation is extremely difficult. Please allocate several trucks from your Society to assist with military transportation, etc. As the Feng and Ma troops have now become the main force of the Righteous Army, it seems that they should be given all kinds of convenience. Please allocate the military trucks purchased and sent to your office by our Society to the Feng and Ma troops within a possible scope to facilitate transportation to the front lines. We are deeply grateful.</p>

<p>Complete Lack of All Replacements</p>
<p>Wu Huanzhang, representative of General Ma Zhanshan stationed in Shanghai, and Jiang Songnian, Councilor of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, received a telegram from Mr. Shao Binshan, Commander of the Second Army of Heilongjiang Province, which stated: (Omitted above) I have received your kind telegram. I am very ashamed of your encouragement. I was saddened by our parting last autumn, separated by the clouds. This time, our army abandoned the river and retreated to Rehe, which is not only heartbreaking for the commander-in-chief, but also for every soldier. However, due to the exhaustion of ammunition and aid, and the lack of food and supplies, the commander-in-chief, considering that the decline was irreversible, ordered the various armies to retreat and await orders in order to preserve their strength for another battle. My brothers and I took the path through the Solun Mountains, traveling for more than a month. During this severe winter, food was insufficient, and more than 400 people died of hunger and cold. When we approached Manzhan, the enemy blocked the dangerous passes and attacked, and armored vehicles pursued us. After two days and nights of fierce fighting, although we killed hundreds of enemies and captured six armored vehicles, more than 700 of our officers and soldiers were killed in battle. The casualties were heavy, and the officers and soldiers were all indignant and wanted to fight to eliminate the enemy. However, due to hunger and exhaustion, and the exhaustion of ammunition, what good would it do to fight with bare hands? Moreover, several thousand brave men had been through many bloody battles, and we could not bear to lightly sacrifice the elite troops in the army, so we temporarily retreated to Linxi to await reinforcements and hope to fight again. I have been traveling arduously, and the men are tired and the horses are weak, and our clothes are torn and our shoes are worn out. Although the local government has temporarily provided supplies so that we are not starving, all replacements are lacking. I hope you will do your best to help. This is what I look forward to. Your brother Shao Binshan respectfully bows.</p>

<p>Sun Said He Could Return to Nanjing in Two or Three Days</p>
<p>Wu Jingxiong Said the Constitution Must Be Practical</p>
<p>Sun Ke, President of the Legislative Yuan, arrived in Shanghai by train at 11:30 last night, accompanied by Secretary-General Liang Hancao and newly appointed legislators Jian Youwen, Chen Jianru, and Zhong Tianxin. A reporter from this newspaper interviewed Mr. Sun at the station last night, who said that he came to handle personal matters and would return to Nanjing in two or three days. Regarding the drafting of the constitution, a constitution drafting committee has been formed and is actively proceeding. Wu Jingxiong, the newly appointed vice-chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan, had arrived in Shanghai the day before and went to the station last night to meet Mr. Sun. According to Mr. Wu, speaking to a reporter from this newspaper, the responsibility for drafting the constitution is heavy, and it is necessary to adopt opinions from all parties so that after the constitution is drafted, each clause can be implemented. Otherwise, it will become a dead constitution, merely a decorative representative, which can be completed in two hours. I am still waiting to finish the report of the Public Works Department, so I will go to Nanjing in one or two weeks.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Zhang Qun Discusses the Policy for Handling Sichuan Affairs <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Intends to Engage in Sincere Consultation Before Entering Sichuan</p>
<p>To Seek a Common Solution</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Central Political Conference recently decided to specially appoint Central Committee Member Zhang Yuejun to Sichuan to discuss concrete measures for reorganizing Sichuan affairs with the Sichuan provincial authorities, based on the 17th-year National Government order. After receiving the order, Mr. Zhang has been in Shanghai for several days, engaging in preliminary consultations with representatives of various generals, including Liu Xiang, Liu Wenhui, and Tian Songyao. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Zhang at his residence yesterday afternoon and asked about the date of his trip to Sichuan and the policy for handling Sichuan affairs. According to Mr. Zhang, the recent turmoil in Sichuan is particularly regrettable at a time when the country is in serious difficulty. The central government is concerned about the overall situation and concerned about the western frontier. The 340th meeting of the Central Political Conference decided to send me to Sichuan to discuss specific implementation measures with the Sichuan provincial authorities based on the central government order of the 17th year. I believe that the safety of Sichuan is related to the overall situation, and the central government must want me to return to Sichuan to discuss matters, so I can only reluctantly make a trip to show my respect and reverence to my hometown, which is also my great wish. However, the disputes in Sichuan have been going on for a long time, and the situation is extremely complex, making a solution very difficult. Recently, the generals in Sichuan, mindful of the difficulties of the times, have stopped internal strife. Taking advantage of this opportunity, if we can jointly seek a solution, end the past, and start a new chapter, so that the people of Sichuan will not suffer the pain of fire and water again, it will be a blessing for Sichuan and a fortune for the country. As for the method of discussing Sichuan affairs, we should of course proceed based on the central government order of the 17th year. However, the road to Sichuan is far away, and it takes time to travel back and forth. At this time, the country is facing many difficulties and there are many things to discuss, so it is difficult to leave for a long time. In order to shorten the time spent in Sichuan, I plan to engage in sincere consultations with the central government's relevant departments and ministries, as well as the Sichuan authorities, in the spirit of impartiality and selflessness, before entering Sichuan. Once there is a slight clue, I will start the journey, and the time spent in Sichuan is expected to be enough to complete the work in one month. As for the establishment of the Sichuan Political Reorganization Committee, the central government is still considering it.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Various Trade Associations Request the Abolition of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Advocating the Use of Tariff Policies for National Products</p>
<p>Commerce and Politics Should No Longer Be Extended</p>
<p>The various trade associations in this city held a joint meeting at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday afternoon to discuss the expiration of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement and the matter of not accepting further negotiations. A total of more than 80 trade associations, including the cotton cloth industry, silk industry, spinning industry, sugar industry, color printing industry, north-south goods exchange industry, new medicine industry, wool industry, rice industry, coal ash industry, and mercerized cotton textile industry, attended, with more than 90 people including Luo Qinghua, Zheng Chengqing, Lu Fengzhu, Chen Songyuan, Lu Wenshao, Zhu Wenqi, Ma Shaoquan, Xie Zhongle, Zheng Zenan, Tu Kaizheng, Ge Jieshen, Ke Ganchen, Ye Jiaxing, and Jin Runxiang. Luo Qinghua chaired the meeting and resolved the following cases: (1) Jointly petition the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Industry to declare the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement invalid and not to be renewed upon expiration. (2) Petition the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce to send telegrams to chambers of commerce across the country to advocate for unity. (3) Appoint representatives to petition in Nanjing, to be appointed at the next joint meeting. (4) Submit a document to Zheng Chengqing to be responsible for drafting. The meeting adjourned after the discussion. The following is the document from the various trade associations to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance: Presenting a petition. It is found that the tariff reciprocity agreement between our country and Japan in the 19th year of the Republic of China will expire on May 6 of this year. General opinion believes that it should not be renewed. In terms of commercial interests, textile factories, flour mills, and marine products are either the main industries of our country or related to the livelihood of coastal fishermen. Japan is geographically close, and the above three items have abundant production and low prices. If taxes are levied at the current lowest tax rate, they will be imported continuously, becoming more prosperous year by year. The operation of factories and the livelihood of fishermen will be taken away and there will be no way to survive. The original meaning of our country's efforts to achieve tariff autonomy was to use tariff policies to maintain infant industries, not just to increase tax revenue. If industries related to the livelihood of the people are not considered for maintenance, then what is the point of tariff autonomy and advocating for national products? The government's advocacy of national products is different from that of ordinary people. It is not just a matter of issuing a notice, but of personally practicing it. The most effective method is to use tariff policies so that our country's products do not suffer extreme pressure. When China and Japan negotiated reciprocal tariffs, the Japanese initially intended to set the effective period to ten or seven years, but our side only allowed three years. This approach was only temporary and transitional. The reason why the deadline was shortened at the time is sufficient to justify why it should not be extended again today. Some argue that if reciprocity expires, the commerce of overseas Chinese will plummet. It is not known that this is precisely what the Japanese are using as bait. For example, silk fabrics are only taxed at 30% less, with an actual tax of 70%, while at the same time, the Japanese are encouraging Japanese in silk and hemp producing areas to manufacture and sell locally in Korea. Korean merchants have long been oppressed to the point of no return. As for instigating riots and driving people back to their home countries, it goes without saying. Under these circumstances, what reciprocity is there to speak of? How can we pursue false fame and forget real disasters? In terms of political interests, the Japanese drive out our officials, kill our people, and occupy our land, and they are still encroaching on it. If this kind of situation happened in other countries, even if they did not resort to war, they would have already withdrawn their ambassadors and closed their markets. We still maintain a normal state and allow them to trade with all countries on the same basis as other countries, which is already a good way to maintain peace. Diplomatic operations should be used to check and balance each other. The way to control one matter with another and to control a third matter with the second is the proper strategy. If the Japanese do not return our invaded land, then we will refuse to negotiate the extension of reciprocity. This is a matter of course that can be announced to the world. Knowing that the Japanese will not hesitate to fight for the Eastern Provinces, this may not change their intention. However, leaving this as a check will still cause inconvenience to their commerce. Otherwise, they will first plunder our territory, and then we will grant them commercial benefits. For them, this is a two-pronged approach, while for us, it is tantamount to rewarding their labor of slaughter. If Chinese and foreign intellectuals see this, they will not only criticize us for being crazy and losing our minds, but also criticize us for willingly flattering the enemy, which will only increase the enemy's arrogance and help their aggression, which is not a blessing for the country. Based on the above reasons, the Sino-Japanese tariff reciprocity agreement should not be renewed upon expiration. Without waiting another day, we should submit a document to your government and departments for review and approval, and immediately declare that the aforementioned agreement will not be accepted for any further negotiations after expiration in order to maintain industry and show determination. This is a public envoy. Respectfully submitted, Shanghai Cotton Cloth Industry, Sugar Industry, Color Printing Industry, Rice Industry, Silk Industry, Sausage Industry, Spinning Industry, New Medicine Industry, Coal Ash Industry, Mercerized Cotton Textile Industry, North-South Goods Industry, Wool Industry, and more than 100 other trade associations.</p>

<p>No Wind or Snow Around Beiping</p>
<p>According to the Zilin News, the heavy snow in the Yangtze River basin has caused great difficulty for the pilots of China Aviation Corporation. Davis arrived in Nanjing by plane on Wednesday morning and continued to Hankou, but was forced to return to Nanjing when he reached Wuhu. Norris flew east from Hankou, but could not proceed further after reaching Jiujiang. It took him five hours to fight the wind and snow to travel from Hankou to Ganzhou, which is only over one hundred miles. Smith flew Zhang Xueliang's Ford plane south from the old capital. It is said that the wind and snow only reached fifteen miles north of Nanjing, and there was no wind or snow around Beiping.</p>

<p>▲ Donating Private Airplane to Aviation Association</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association received a letter from Durinberg (a member of the British Aviation Corps) yesterday, stating that he had previously lived in Harbin and was very angry at the Japanese atrocities. He recently came to this city and is willing to sell his private airplane to the association at a reduced price (a photo of the airplane is attached to the letter), and is willing to voluntarily teach the association's Chinese members the art of airplane piloting.</p>
<p>Postponing the Move Again: Lin, the Standing Director and Secretary-General of the Association, told a reporter from Xinsheng News yesterday that the Association's office has been decided to be located on Jisi Feier Road. However, the Aviation National Salvation Propaganda Week is from the 23rd to the 28th of this month, and the Association's affairs are relatively complicated. The remote location in the west is quite inconvenient, so it has been decided to move in after the 28th.</p>
<p>Donations: The Shaoxing Seven Counties Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association previously advised the public to donate the money saved from wasteful customs during the New Year to the Aviation Association. Recently, donations have been very enthusiastic. It has also sent a letter to the association requesting a special column in the newspaper to publish a thank-you advertisement, and the association is in the process of handling this. For donations from all sectors, it has decided to organize a custody committee to manage the donations.</p>

<p>At this Wednesday's meeting of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, the Director-General raised the issue of the date of the Board of Directors election and the date of the annual meeting of taxpayers (Westerners).

<h3 id="e109">China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Reorganizes Business and Recovers Hunan Provincial Shipping <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Hunan route of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was recently increased, and the docks and warehouses were all rented from the Pujii Company. Recently, the American Jiangjiang Company, in order to develop the shipping business on the Yangtze River, decided to increase the number of ships on the Hunan route, considering that Hunan rice is exported in large quantities. Because there were no docks or warehouses, Xu Zuxin was sent to Changsha to take over the Pujii docks, and a contract has been signed. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company received the news and believed that this move involved the shipping rights of Hunan Province. If it fell into the hands of foreign merchants, it would stop the company's shipping business in Hunan. Therefore, it telegraphed the Hunan branch to strongly request the Pujii Company to revoke the foreign merchant's contract and continue to lease it to the company. Yesterday, it received a telegram stating that this matter had been successfully completed, and the shipping rights of Hunan Province had been recovered. The renewal contract is being signed.</p>
<p>Stopping the Guangli Steamboat: The Guangli steamboat of the Nanyang line is over 40 years old, uses a lot of coal, and has a small speed. It has passed its production period. Liu Hongsheng specially ordered the chief captain and chief engineer to survey the ship's hull to see if it was suitable for use. As a result, due to excessive consumption and operating losses, it was decided to stop the ship and not sail it. Yesterday, it was towed to the Longhua River and anchored. All the business personnel and stewards in the ship were dismissed. Except for six people who were kept to look after the ship, all the rest, including the captain and the stoker, were laid off. Each was paid two months' salary and dismissed.</p>
<p>Insurance for Ship Staff and Seamen: The company has a total of 25 ships on the Yangtze River and the sea, with more than a thousand ship staff and seamen. In the past, when accidents occurred on the Xinhua and other ships, major disputes arose over the compensation for ship staff and seamen. Now, the shipping department has formulated a plan for all ship staff and seamen to uniformly insure against maritime accidents. The premium is very low and is deducted from the monthly salary. In the event of misfortune, compensation can be obtained to support their families. The plan has been approved and implemented by the general manager.</p>
<p>Continuing to Lease Inland River Ships: After the Zhejiang Construction Department leased the company's inland river ships, it subleased them to Zhang Jingpei for operation. This year, the lease is about to expire. The Zhejiang Construction Department specially sent a commissioner to Shanghai to discuss the renewal of the lease with General Manager Liu. Liu has agreed that the Zhejiang Construction Department will still have the priority to renew the lease when it expires.</p>
<p>New Ningxing Ship Refloated After Running Aground</p>
<p>The new Ningxing, a Yangtze River ship of the Sanbei Company, was carrying a large number of goods and passengers from Shanghai to Hankou this time. On the afternoon of the 18th, the ship ran aground on a shoal off the coast of Xiaogushan on the Zhenjiang River due to heavy snow. At that time, because the iron keel was too heavy, it sank into the shoal and could not move. The shipowner sent a telegram for help, which was received by the Changxing, a Yangtze River ship of our company, which sailed to tow it. After five hours of towing, it was still unable to pull it out of the shoal. The new Ningxing then sent a telegram to Shanghai for help. The Shanghai office telegraphed the Fengpu ship to sail to assist in the towing. It was not until yesterday morning that a telegram was received stating that the new Ningxing had been pulled out of the shoal by the combined efforts of the Changxing and Fengpu. It is not yet known whether the hull was damaged and must be inspected after unloading the goods in Hankou.</p>

<p>The Wusong steamboat sailed back to Shanghai from Hankou at 2 pm yesterday and docked at the Taikoo Wharf. After receiving a telegram from Hankou in advance, the company was deeply afraid of accidents at the wharf and specially requested the French Concession Police to send detectives to protect it in case of emergency. Therefore, around 1 pm yesterday, more than 30 Chinese and Western detectives, armed with live ammunition, were closely guarding the vicinity of the wharf, and traffic was almost cut off. Suspicious pedestrians were also inspected. They had not retreated by the evening, so all the stewards on the ship could not board the ship to work.</p>
<h3 id="e111">After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Continued to Lay Off Employees, the Trade Union Held a General Meeting of Members Yesterday <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Resolved to Take Concerted Action When Necessary</p>
<p>Refusing to Receive Severance Pay, a Letter Will Be Sent to the Head Office Today</p>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company announced the continued layoff of 117 wharf workers from the five wharves, the laid-off workers petitioned the board of directors. Yesterday, the branch unions of each warehouse held general meetings of members separately to collect malpractices and unfair reasons from the warehouse managers and decided to report them to the board of directors today. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>General Meeting of Members: Workers from the five wharves of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, including China, North, New, Central, and South, held general meetings of members separately from 10 am yesterday to discuss the general office's layoff plan. The resolutions were generally summarized into two points: (1) Actively seek ways to assist the laid-off members. (2) Take concerted action when necessary. A reporter from Xinsheng News met with Xue Yinda, the standing director of the trade union, yesterday, who said that the members of the union are currently organizing the malpractices of the warehouse managers and the unfair facts and reasons for the layoffs, and will submit a document to the board of directors for correction tomorrow (i.e., today).

<h3 id="e114">Special District Courts Jointly Establish Bonus System for Clerks <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Those Who Are Honest and Diligent Without Fault Will Receive Awards</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court Second Branch · Shanghai First Special District Local Court · Jointly Issued Public Notice No. 1371: For the matter of a public notice, it has been found that court clerks often engage in corrupt practices. The main reason is that their salaries are too low. Those with larger families find it difficult to support themselves in ordinary times, and even more so when they encounter weddings, funerals, or illnesses. Because court clerks have limited education and are exposed to many external temptations, they often seek illicit gains when given the opportunity, violating strict prohibitions. While their behavior should be severely punished, the underlying motivation should also be addressed. In light of this, the two courts have jointly established ten articles for a bonus system for court clerks. Any clerk who is honest, diligent, and without fault will receive a monthly bonus, which is tantamount to increasing their salary. The bonus will also be deposited and accrue interest, providing security for unforeseen circumstances, similar to labor insurance. However, the stored bonus cannot be withdrawn at will. If corrupt practices are discovered, the entire amount will be confiscated. With years of accumulated savings at stake, who would risk a small gain for a significant loss? This is a combination of reward and punishment, hoping to guide them towards repentance and improvement. It is hoped that this is understood by all. The established system will be implemented from January 1st of this year. This public notice is hereby issued for general information. The ten articles of the court clerk bonus system are listed below for the benefit of all court clerks and litigants of both courts. This notice includes: Court Clerk Bonus System, ㈠ The court has established a court clerk bonus to encourage honesty and diligence among court clerks. ㈡ Clerks who are honest, diligent, and without fault will receive a bonus of four to six yuan per month in addition to their original salary. ㈢ The bonus to be received by the clerk will be deposited monthly by the General Affairs Office into the Postal Savings Bureau to accrue interest. All withdrawals will require the signature of the General Affairs Office. The clerk can hold the bonus passbook, but it cannot be used to borrow money. ㈣ If a clerk commits a minor fault, the bonus for that month will be reduced accordingly. If corrupt practices are discovered that damage the court's reputation, such as accepting bribes, tips, or engaging in fraudulent activities, they will be severely punished according to law, and all accumulated bonuses will be confiscated. ㈤ All confiscated bonuses will be deposited by the General Affairs Office into a separate account as a special award fund. ㈥ Clerks who refuse to accept bribes or tips from litigants and immediately report it will be given a special bonus based on the circumstances. ㈦ Clerks who see other clerks accepting bribes or tips and immediately report it will be given a special bonus based on the circumstances. The names of the informants will be kept confidential by the responsible personnel. ㈧ If a clerk needs funds urgently due to a major event such as a wedding, funeral, or illness, they may request an advance on a portion of their stored bonus, but it must be verified by the General Affairs Office and reviewed by the Chief Clerk before being issued. ㈨ When a clerk resigns or leaves the court, except for those dismissed for corruption, the stored bonus, principal, and interest will be returned in full. ㈩ This system will be implemented from January 1, 1933. President of the Court Shen Jia · President of the Court Guo Yunguan · January 19, 1933, Republic of China.</p>

Gamblers select ten characters each time, and if the ten characters selected are exactly the same as the ones drawn, they can win a bonus of several thousand yuan for every yuan bet. Even matching some of the characters can result in a large bonus. Seeing such large bonuses, general gamblers believe they can become rich overnight, so they flock to it. The representative of the Shanghai operating branch is Zhang Zhongqia (also known as Zhang De), the owner of the Yuelai Cantonese Food Store at 586 Wuchang Road, who is Cantonese. This matter was learned by Yao Jialin, the Chinese Detective Chief of District C of the Public Concession Police, who went on the tenth of last month to arrest Zhang, along with lottery tickets, and handed them over to the First Special Court. On the eleventh, Zhang was sentenced to two months imprisonment and fined 120 yuan. Zhang refused to accept the judgment and appealed to the collegiate bench of the Special Court, but the appeal was rejected. However, because Zhang was a first-time offender, the sentence was suspended for two years. After Zhang was released from prison, he still did not repent and continued to operate this gambling lottery as before. Unexpectedly, Yao the Detective Chief found out again, reported to the Special Court, and obtained a search warrant. At 6 p.m. the day before yesterday, he led police officers to search the premises. At that time, Zhang was writing lottery tickets with his partner, Cantonese man Zhang Yifen. Yao arrested them, confiscated many lottery tickets and money, and took them back to the Hongkou Police Station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Division of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit in accordance with Article 280 of the Criminal Law, and stated that although the defendant Zhang Zhongqia was nominally operating the Yuelai Food Store, the store was just a front, and his only productive capacity was actually operating the lottery. Although he had been arrested last time, the court sentence was too light, so the defendant did not know shame and continued to operate as before. Unexpectedly, he was caught by the police again. Therefore, he requested the court to impose a severe penalty to serve as a warning to others. Following this, Detective Chief Yao Jialin submitted a report detailing the circumstances of the seizure, and explained in detail the usage of the seized lottery tickets, etc. When questioned, Zhang Zhongyi denied operating a gambling lottery. Zhang Yifen confessed without denial. Judge Liu Gui verified the confession and immediately pronounced the judgment: Zhang Zhongyi was sentenced to four months imprisonment and fined 200 yuan; Zhang Yifen was sentenced to two months imprisonment and fined 80 yuan. If the fines were not paid, they would be converted into imprisonment at a rate of two yuan per day. After the sentencing, the defendants declared they would appeal and requested permission to post bail. The court then ordered that each be allowed to post 600 yuan bail during the appeal period and await further trial outside the court.</p>

<p>Awards Certificate of Merit</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that since the beginning of the 18th year of the Republic, the Municipal Public Works Bureau formulated a reform plan for the city's inland water company, ordering the company to carry out improvements accordingly. In February of that year, the company first ordered four sets each of raw water electric pumps and clean water electric pumps. In September, it built two coagulation sedimentation tanks and six rapid filter tanks, with a daily water output of more than 45,000 cubic meters. It also added two clean water tanks with a capacity of approximately 17,700 cubic feet, a water tower with a capacity of approximately 286 cubic meters, and other projects such as raw water wells, alum water tanks, raw water machines, adjustment tanks, transformer stations, main water gate rooms, meter rooms, etc., all of which were completed in the autumn of the 20th year. All original steam engines and alum water tanks before the 18th year were immediately shut down. The total capital increase for various reconstruction, additions and installations, and the purchase of large pipe water meters, etc., amounted to approximately 2 million yuan. Since then, the water quality, water volume, and water pressure have all significantly improved, and the citizens of South Shanghai can often enjoy clean and sufficient drinking water. At the same time, internal organization and administration have also been greatly reformed, washing away accumulated bad habits. Therefore, last month, the Municipal Public Works Bureau requested the Municipal Government to issue a commendation. The Municipal Government specially issued a certificate of merit yesterday as follows: "The Inland Water Company has improved its equipment, fully supplying clean drinking water, benefiting the citizens, and has made meritorious contributions to construction. It is deeply commendable. This certificate is hereby awarded."</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I have read the news item in your newspaper of January 20, entitled "Disputes in the North among Former Contractors of Hangzhou Passenger Car Tea and Snacks," and the details contained therein are completely inconsistent with the facts. Please correct them to avoid rumors. The workers of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway tea and snacks were oppressed by the subcontracting system of Xu Huisheng, the representative of Shunli Company, in 18 years of the Republic, which led to anti-subcontracting disputes. The parties signed an agreement. When the contract expired, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Tea and Snacks Association took over from the Railway Bureau. First, on July ____ 20th, an agreement was signed with the Bureau. on July of the 21st year the contract expired, A request was made for renewal, so the first contract was signed again in that year. At 4 p.m. that day, the representatives of the workers, Sun Wen ______, _______ Lin, Lu Yisheng, and three people, the Bureau _______, deputy head of, Business section head and and Chief tang signed to order the second contract, which approved by the head limited time of one year and ensured a deposit of 3,000 yuan (the deposit from the 20th to the 21st year was 1,666 yuan, 6 jiao, and 6 fen). After the full payment was made, the contract could be issued immediately. Then, on _____ month 24, The workers deposited the remaining 1,233 yuan, 3 jiao, and 4 fen, totaling 2,000 yuan, and the Business Section issued a receipt. Repeatedly sending people to request the issuance of a new contract. Department Chief Zheng of the Office repeatedly delayed the appointment. After the new Director Huang took office, he also went to the Traffic Department several times to Chief Zheng issued new contract. At first, it was said that the new director had not been in office for long and was busy with official duties, so we should wait a few days before it could be issued. Then, he made irresponsible excuses. Suddenly, on the 12th of this month, he advertised for bids. Then, on the 16th, the people Chief Zheng, Unexpectedly said that the new contract has not been signed, the deposit of 3,000 yuan can be returned, etc., is self-contradictory and evasive, showing that his methods are despicable and violent. May I ask that since the new contract has not been signed, how can the full deposit be collected? Whose fault is it? There should be public opinion. Therefore, many petitions were made later, but all were ineffective. On the morning of the 19th of this month, the workers, driven by livelihood, automatically led their wives and children to the Relief Office to petition again. 30 railway police officers were sent to drive away the petitioning women and children. After being informed, In addition to reporting to the two railway party departments, it was deeply feared that the dispute would escalate. Therefore, worker representatives Lu Jinkun, Mei Ruisheng, Qian Zuhong, etc. were sent to persuade the workers to return home and wait quietly for a solution. Unexpectedly, the railway police mistakenly identified the three representatives as instigators and detained them at the police station and transferred them to the Public Security Bureau. Therefore, the battle situation described in your newspaper is largely untrue. The matter is of great importance, so I am writing to request a correction. This letter is addressed to the Shenbao Newspaper Office. Sincerely, The Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Tea and Snacks Association.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I have just read the news item in your newspaper's local news column, entitled "Former Contractors of Shanghai-Hangzhou Passenger Car Tea and Snacks Disturbed in the North", which contained the following statements: "Sun Wenpin, who claims to be the manager of the Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger car tea and snacks, and dozens of family members of the workers he hired, stormed into the office of the chief of the Traffic Department, demanding the cancellation of the bidding" and "It is said that Sun Wenpin's contract for the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway tea and snacks expired in July of last year, and former Director Chen Xinghan approved the continuation of the contract and ordered a deposit of 3,000 yuan to be paid in advance, pending review and approval. However, this matter has not yet been determined, and Sun Wenpin has already posted an advertisement claiming to be the contractor, which is close to deception." The above is not consistent with the facts. The Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway tea and snacks business has always been contracted by the former Tea and Snacks Cooperative (now renamed the Tea and Snacks Association). After being publicly elected by the members, I am the representative of the masses, not an individual contractor. I have never used my personal name to post an advertisement claiming to be the contractor, which can be verified and need not be elaborated on. As for the petition to the Traffic Department by the workers and their families yesterday, it was also driven by livelihood and has been investigated and dealt with by the association. The matter concerns my reputation, and I should write to your newspaper to request a quick correction. This is addressed to Mr. Editor of the Shenbao Newspaper Office. Sincerely, Sun Wenpin.</p>

<h3 id="e142">The Problem of the "Panic Cycle Law" <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Wang Xiping丨</p>
<p>In your esteemed newspaper, Mr. Nai mentioned the problem of the "panic cycle law" in a previous current affairs commentary, including the following words: "The theory of prosperity and decline is not only embraced by our country's ancient sages, but also regarded as a fundamental truth by Western economists, namely the so-called panic cycle law. We do not wish to fundamentally deny the panic cycle law, but only to modify it." When I read this passage, I felt a bit doubtful in my heart. Because according to Mr. Nai's meaning, the panic cycle law advocated by European economists is mostly the same as the so-called "cycle" of our country's ancient sages, and now we need Mr. Nai of China to modify it on their behalf, changing the "merry-go-round" panic cycle theory into a "spiral" panic cycle theory. In fact, the facts are not like this, so I raise this question, intending to remind Mr. Nai that the panic cycle law referred to by Western economists is not only a "merry-go-round" type, but also a "spiral" type, and it seems that Mr. Nai does not need to modify it. It would be appreciated if Mr. Nai would elaborate and support it. I will introduce the materialistic dialectical panic cycle theory of Western economists below for reference, and note that it was published in "1894." However, due to other reasons, I could not immediately point out the author and book title. Later, your newspaper published this article, but deleted the above-mentioned important introductory text. At the same time, Mr. Nai's answer admitted that "orthodox economists believe that the panic cycle law is a merry-go-round type." The implication is that non-orthodox economists may also oppose this merry-go-round panic cycle theory, and I thought that was fine. Because the reader's consultant column is not a place where this kind of issue can be fully discussed. Today, I saw Mr. Nai's opinion on the question I raised last time from a friend, saying: "..." very meaningful, but the wording is quite unclear, probably because the author is busy. It would be quite interesting if the author could organize and re-present it for discussion." What exactly does "the wording is quite unclear" refer to? The panic cycle theory I introduced is entirely from the author's original text. Does "the wording is quite unclear" refer to my translation, or does it refer to the original text I translated? Moreover, I have not added any of my own opinions. Now, I will re-record the original text on this issue below for instruction: "Mr. Nai's conclusion on the panic cycle is very appropriate, but the theory of the panic cycle law published in 1894 is not as Mr. Nai said. Here is a brief introduction of the original text: "The statistics of exporters give a standard for the reality, that is, the accumulation of productive capital and commodity capital. And the statistics often indicate the following fact, that is, in the development period of the operation of British industry (1815 to 1870) in the ten-year cycle, each time at the highest limit of the last prosperous period of the panic, it is newly expressed as the lowest limit of the next prosperous period, and then rises to a higher new highest limit." Thus, a factual proof is given to us from the statistics: "The actual, i.e., declared, value of exports of British and Irish products in the prosperous period of 1814 was £40,396,300. Then the panic of 1825 brought the export volume below this total, fluctuating between 35 million and 39 million per year. Because of the recovery of the economy in 1834, the export volume rose again and exceeded the previous highest level, reaching £41,649,191, and reaching a new highest limit of £53,368,571 in 1836. Then, in 1837, the amount of exports was reduced to 42 million, so that the new lowest limit was already higher than the old highest limit, and then it fluctuated between 50 million and 53 million pounds. In 1844, the atmosphere recovered, thus raising the export volume to 58.5 million, that is, the highest limit of 1826 had already been far exceeded by this export volume. In 1845, the export volume reached £60,111,082; then in 1846, it was strong at £57 million, in 1847, it was about £59 million, in 1848, it was about £53 million, and in 1849, it rose to £63.5 million. In 1853, it was about 99 million, in 1849, it rose to 63.5 million, in 1853, it was about 99 million, in 1854, it was 97 million, in 1855, it was 54.5 million, in 1856, it was about 100.06 million, and in 1857, it reached the highest limit with 122 million. In 1858, the export volume was reduced to 111.6 million, but by 1859 it had risen to 130 million, in 1860 it was about 136 million, and in 1861 it was only 125 million (here, the new lowest limit was higher than the previous highest limit,) 146.65 million pounds in 1863 (same as above 丨 same page). " This development of the panic cycle is clearly not a "merry-go-round" type, but a "spiral" type; that is to say, it is not formalistic (it can also be said that it is not of the orthodox school of economics) but is a dialectical development of the negation of the negation to a higher level."...... The above paragraph, except that I deleted some words complimenting Mr. Nai and added the words "not of the orthodox school of economics," is all copied from the last original text. With my clumsy understanding, his explanation of the meaning of the panic cycle law is very clear, and there is no "unclear" place. The two footnotes I made are even more obvious. I don't know what exactly Mr. Nai means by "the wording is quite unclear". I respectfully request instruction. (Furthermore, the article introduced in this article is from page 29 of the first volume of the third volume of the German "Capital." If the discussion text is not convenient to publish in the newspaper, please reply by letter from Mr. Nai.)</p>
<p>Reporter's Note: Regarding the question of the "panic cycle law," Mr. Wang and his reply have aroused interest. Regarding the opinions stated in the letter on the right, if Mr. Nai of this newspaper believes that there is still room for discussion, in addition to continuing the discussion, readers are welcome to submit letters for discussion if they have any insightful opinions.</p>

The examination results were originally scheduled to be announced jointly with the schools in the Second District on the 27th of this month.

<p>(Nanjing, 20th) The first Chinese Education Yearbook has been delayed due to the incomplete submission of materials from various provinces and cities. The Ministry of Education held another yearbook editing meeting on the 20th. Since most of the materials from the Great Shanghai and Compilation and Translation Hall are complete, special telegrams have been sent to Jiangsu, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei Education Departments and the Education Bureaus of various provinces and cities that have not yet submitted all the materials, limiting them to submit the materials within one month of receiving the telegram, so as to complete the compilation.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Chen Kezhong Discusses the Overview of Inspecting Education in Fujian Province <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education previously sent Dr. Chen Kezhong, a full-time editor and reviewer of the National Compilation and Translation Hall, to inspect the education status of public and private secondary schools and above in Fuzhou and Xiamen, Fujian Province. Chen arrived in Fuzhou on the 22nd of last month, inspected for four weeks, and returned to Beijing on the evening of the 18th of this month. According to a conversation with Dr. Chen by reporters on the 19th, a summary of the inspection is as follows.</p>
<p>Chen's inspection situation, divided by location, includes four schools in Xiamen and twenty schools in Fuzhou. In terms of school level, it includes four higher education schools and twenty secondary education schools. (1) Higher Education: Xiamen University's science equipment is very good. The school and Jimei are both operated privately by Chen Jiageng. The rumor that Chen Jiageng is going bankrupt is not true. Chen Jiageng still subsidizes Xiamen University with 12,000 yuan per month and Jimei Middle School with 10,000 yuan per month. The provincial government has recently approved a subsidy of 60,000 yuan per year (5,000 per month) for the university, so it is unlikely to be shaken as rumored. This is one university. Also inspected were Fujian Union Theological College and South China Women's College (the above three colleges were changed from universities to colleges, and South China is a women's college). South China Women's College is the only highest women's education institution in Fujian, with a history of more than twenty years. It is well-managed, but it has not yet been officially registered. Union Theological College has complete facilities, especially the best science equipment, which is better than other famous universities in various places. After inspecting one university and three colleges, it is planned to cooperate and become a perfect university. Chen Kezhong and Zheng Zhenwen, the director of the Education Department, convened a meeting of university presidents, including Lin Wenqing, the president of Xiamen University, He Gonggan, the president of Fuzhou College, and Lin Jingrun, the president of Union Theological College, as well as the academic deans of each school. After joint design, the higher education institutions in Fujian will be divided into labor and cooperation, each focusing on the points and trends they have adopted, identifying goals, and handling them separately without repetition.</p>

<p>The original recommendation is as follows: A. An efficient teaching profession. The training of teachers must be reformed. All teachers in the country should have an equal standard determined by the state with regulations, and it is recommended that the state hold teacher examinations, starting with the examination of middle school teachers, and then to other stages. The salaries of teachers at all levels should be stipulated in accordance with a certain grade and must be paid on time. The lack of security in the teaching profession, that is, the instability of the teaching profession and the main reason for the reduction of efficiency. The number of university lectureships and teacher positions should be limited, but they must be stabilized. The appointment of teachers should be entirely based on qualifications. Only in cases of clear incompetence or for the purpose of warning can dismissal be permitted. Teachers should be appointed by the competent education authority and not by the principal.</p>
<p>Resolution (3) The points mentioned in the first section of the third item, establishing an efficient school system, can be sent to the Ministry of Education for reference.</p>
<p>Original Resolution Section 1 is as follows: An efficient school system. In order to build a truly efficient education system for the country, elementary education must be compulsory, and six years of education should be the goal, but in special circumstances in the locality, four years of compulsory education can also be recognized. Since compulsory education is implemented, elementary education must be free. All children who come to school do not pay fees. Elementary schools are the foundation of the education system. Under the current situation, the development of elementary schools in China is extremely important. The implementation of compulsory education must be investigated on the ground in pilot cities and counties and prepared with caution. Because elementary education is fundamentally important, the National Government and all provinces should allocate funds for this item. The Ministry of Education should set up a special elementary education department. Also, if the number of students taught by each teacher and each school is increased, the efficiency of the use of schools and teachers can be further increased.</p>
<p>Resolution (4) The points mentioned in the first, second, and third sections of the fourth item, establishing an efficient teaching method, can be formulated in detail by the Ministry of Education, and ordered the education halls and bureaus of each province and city to transfer the order to the schools at all levels under their jurisdiction to strictly follow.</p>
<p>Original Resolutions Sections 1, 2, and 3 are as follows:</p>
<p>Efficient Teaching</p>
<p>(1) All teachers must be proficient in the lessons they teach, and not just be proficient in their teaching methods. Basic research on history and psychology in education is certainly important, but this research should not obscure the teaching materials themselves.</p>
<p>(2) Teaching should rely less on textbooks and more on experiments and practical work (especially in science) and reference books (in history and language).</p>
<p>(3) The hours of lectures in all schools should be reduced, and the hours used in laboratories and manual labor should be increased.</p>
<p>(For example, A runs science, B runs science, and C runs education. The result of division of labor and cooperation is very unsatisfactory. 1) Secondary education: A total of 20 schools were inspected. The equipment for science and library is lacking (judging from the equipment that should be available according to the curriculum standards, there is too little. If we look at the modern equipment of general schools, they are also average). Some schools have too much political color and should be improved. With the Education Department planning to establish a public science museum in the near future to subsidize the inadequacy of the scientific equipment of each school, schools in the provincial capital can use it at any time. 3) The Civil Education Center is located in the park, which is not suitable. And the museum has all the equipment standards set by the Ministry of Education, but it fails to consider the actual situation of the locality when allocating equipment. It seems uneconomical.</p>

<p>The Anhui Department of Education recently formulated an outline for rectifying local education in the second half of the 21st year, and issued an order to the county magistrates and education bureau directors to earnestly implement it. The outline is divided into three items: local education funds, local school education, and civil education, with a total of 30 items, which must be completed uniformly within this year.</p>

<h3 id="e153">Schools Should Adopt Textbooks Incorporating the New Metric System <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>▲The Municipal Education Bureau Recently Ordered All Schools to Comply</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau previously approved the letter from the National Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry requesting the promotion of the new metric system, and specifically ordered it to the schools in this city. The official letter from the National Bureau of Weights and Measures of the Ministry of Industry stated: "After investigation, the officialdom in our country is vast, and the weights and measures vary, resulting in rampant fraud and numerous harms, which have a profound impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is imperative to formulate standards that the entire country can follow in order to eliminate malpractice and achieve unification. The National Government, in view of this, has successively promulgated the standards of weights and measures, as well as various subsidiary laws and regulations of the Republic of China, for compliance. Since its implementation, it has achieved remarkable results. At present, the provinces and cities along the Yangtze River and the coast have taken the lead in implementation, and the provinces in the interior will also implement it in the near future. The unification of the country is not far away. However, the people of our country are conservative and have deep-rooted habits that are difficult to change. In the course of promotion, resistance is often generated. Without widespread publicity, it is not enough to achieve the effect of being known to every household. Young students have not yet developed deep-rooted habits. If they can instill the content of the new metric system and the unified methods as early as possible, it will be of great benefit to the promotion of the metric system. For this reason, we have selectively copied the aforementioned laws and regulations, sent them for review, and hope that you will print and distribute them to the schools under your jurisdiction and the education bureaus of each county, set a date, and convene all students to explain the content of the new metric system and its promotion methods, in order to achieve the effect of taking the lead. As for the arithmetic textbooks used in primary and secondary schools, those that have incorporated the new metric system must be adopted as soon as possible to ensure consistency." In addition to replying to the letter, we are issuing the laws and regulations, ordering the schools to comply with the publicity, and the primary and secondary school arithmetic textbooks must adopt those that have incorporated the new metric system. This order.</p>

<p>▲Soochow University Wins 63-46 After Initial Defeat</p>
<p>▲Military Academy Takes the Lead in the First Half, Loses After Key Player is Fouled Out</p>
<p>Military Academy's Bad Luck, Both Forwards Fouled Out</p>
<p>Military Academy to Play St. John's Tonight at 8 PM</p>
<p>The Nanjing Central Military Academy basketball team, invited to Shanghai, lost its first match against Soochow University last night, suffering a defeat of 63-46. In the first half, the Military Academy led 26-23 by three points. Although the Military Academy lost, its performance was excellent. The accuracy of its long-range shots was particularly commendable. In the second half, the two forwards, Liu Gongchang, were fouled out with four fouls each. Soochow University took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack, and the Military Academy eventually lost its defense. The audience regretted it, and it was attributed to bad luck. Tonight at 8 PM, they will play St. John's, still at the Western YMCA.</p>
<h3 id="e168">▲Strengths and Weaknesses of the Military Academy <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>▲Entirely Relies on Long-Range Shots The outstanding feature of the Military Academy is its accurate long-range shooting, especially Liu Gongchang. He rarely misses when he raises his hand to shoot from afar. The entire team's offensive method is to pass the ball forward with high passes, relying on their tall and strong physiques. When they reach outside the free-throw line, they shoot the ball into the basket, never attempting shots near the basket.</p>
<p>▲Poor Jump Balls by Center Center Huang Jianding did not show his strengths last night and was not outstanding. Losing the jump balls was a major cause of the defeat. Soochow University won every jump ball at opportune moments and scored by dribbling straight to the basket. The Military Academy lost more than just ten or twenty points because of this. The inability to shoot near the basket is also a weakness. Their straightforward, non-turning offensive method needs improvement.</p>
<p>▲Two Backs Are Commendable Their defensive strategy of using a five-man zone defense kept Soochow University at bay in the first half. However, it broke down in the second half. Captain Wang Shixuan was the most outstanding of the two backs, excelling in both offense and defense. He is the brain of the entire team. With Gao Lingzhao, both are tall and strong, making it difficult for Soochow University's attacks. Overall, the team is above average and not just an ordinary team.</p>
<p>▲Soochow University Wins After Initial Defeat</p>
<p>▲The Golden Age of the Military Academy In the first minute of the game, Soochow University won the jump ball twice in a row. Feng Nianhua turned around and broke into the basket to score. He repeated the move several times, taking a 4-0 lead. The Military Academy then strengthened its defense and tied the score at 4-4. They then took a 6-4 lead. Thanks to Liu Gongchang's beautiful long-range shots, they led the way, with Soochow University only able to follow. The Military Academy's peak was 20-11 and 26-15. Soochow University worked hard and added eight points. The Military Academy had the upper hand in the first half, winning by three points at 26-23.</p>
<p>▲Forwards are Fouled Out When the second half began, the Military Academy added two more points. However, Soochow University replaced Feng Nianhua, who had three fouls, with Yuan Qingwu, who broke through the Military Academy's defense. As expected, the score gradually became tied at 30. Then, the situation suddenly changed. Liu Gongchang, the Military Academy's best shooter, was fouled out with four fouls. Soochow University took the opportunity to launch a major offensive. Sure enough, they took a 36-34 lead by two points.</p>
<p>▲The Entire Situation Changes From then on, the Military Academy's offensive power greatly diminished. Soochow University's shots were extraordinary, and they won by ten points at 44-34. The Military Academy narrowed the gap to 46-40, still six points behind. Soochow University then scored several times in a row, reaching 54-44. Li Gongyu, the Military Academy's left forward, was also fouled out with four fouls. As a result, the entire team faltered and could not recover. At the end of the game, Soochow University won 63-46.</p>

<p>Xia Guang Defeats Seventh Team 53-25 Last Night</p>
<p>The Shanghai Basketball Association's Group A games began last night. The first match was between Xia Guang and Seventh Team. Neither team is a top-tier team. Chen Baoqiu and Wei Zuohan of Xia Guang did not play. The situation was quite even in the first five points. Afterwards, Xia Guang's players were sharp and Ren Jiexing showed his skills, making every shot. Lin Peisheng in the back was well-prepared. Seventh Team's lineup was weak and lacked strength. In the first half, Xia Guang greatly outscored Seventh Team 37-6. Starting in the second half, Seventh Team scored fifteen points, which was not easy, so the situation seemed more balanced. The result was 53-25, with Xia Guang winning. Ren Jiexing was the highest scorer for the winning team, scoring 26 points. In Group B, the Yidui team defeated Muer. The situation was even and quite watchable. In the first half, the Yidui team won 13-5. The situation was tense in the second half. The result was 30-21, with the Yidui team winning. In the last game, Tujin defeated Liangxi. The teams were similar in strength.</p>
<p>The results were remarkable. In the end, Tujin won 24-17. Tonight, there will be two Group A matches: Melling vs. Zhenru, with strong teams and sure to be a thrilling battle, starting at 7:30 PM at the Chinese Basketball Hall. Jianhua vs. Tongji will start at 6:30 PM.</p>

<p>— Zhongxian</p>
<p>▲Two Faces</p>
<p>Shanghai people's faces are like gold ingots, they have a "head," but flipping them over, there are only two faces: one true face, one false face. There's really nothing new.</p>
<p>Most Shanghai people, after nodding and smiling at someone, will open their mouths and ask, "Old Shi, have you eaten?" In fact, he doesn't need to know about other people's eating habits at all. Whether or not other people eat has nothing to do with him. It can be seen that he is being disingenuous from the start.</p>
<p>If you show your true face when dealing with the world, you will inevitably suffer losses and setbacks everywhere. Everyone has to use a false face to maneuver around everything, so the faces we see are all "reverse sides," and we never see the "front" of the face.</p>
<p>Shanghai people are like this, and Shanghai as a place is also like this.</p>
<p>How beautiful is the surface of Shanghai! Flat, wide roads, three-dimensional, magnificent buildings, electric lights shining like daylight, and other dedicated material civilization are unimaginable to people from the interior. Shanghai is truly like heaven!</p>
<p>What is the reverse side of Shanghai? This is not easily seen by people walking on the streets. Only a small fraction of it can be seen in newspaper reports.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Snow and Blood <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyiguan Lord</p>
<p>丨Words Sound the Same Despite Being Different丨</p>
<p>Many days of warmth, one night of north wind, and then this heavy snow blew in.</p>
<p>Speaking of this "snow," from ancient times to the present, poets and writers have created so many anecdotes for it. What is it like to step on snow to find plum blossoms, what is it like to compose poems about snow, and what is it like to enjoy the snow scene with lamb wine? There are so many timely pleasures that cannot be said enough. In short, in the past, during times of "national peace and prosperity," this "snow" was the most beautiful decoration of the human world!</p>
<p>However, during this "national crisis," wherever the iron hooves of the tyrannical sun reached, the mountains and rivers of our country changed color. Only the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteers shed blood to resist the enemy! So, now, one night of north wind has blown in this heavy snow, just because this snow blown in by the north wind at this time, I feel a bit of the bloodiness of the volunteers. At the same time, I feel even more that this "snow" and "blood," although the words are different, sound the same. In the past, during times of "national peace and prosperity," this was naturally not felt. However, now, during the "period of national crisis," seeing this "snow" cannot help but make me think of that "blood" - the blood of the volunteers. I wonder if the people of our country, when seeing this pure white "snow" at this time, can think of that bright red "blood"?</p>
<h3 id="e174">Modern Trilogy <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>丨Movies, Dancing, Golf丨</p>
<p>"Miss ×, would you like to go to the movies? The film at the Cathay today is very good."</p>
<p>Such a request is certainly very polite to a girlfriend and can be considered elegant if you propose it to your girlfriend like that. But in fact, it is often not that easy. Being polite is of course another matter, because the answer often ends up being something like this: "Sorry, I already have an engagement," or "Oh, I'm not free. Mr. Zhang has asked me to go to the Camidrome to feather dance."</p>
<p>From the latter result, it tells you that going to the movies is certainly modern, that goes without saying, but isn't dancing also modern? So if you want to be completely modern, you must know how to dance. Of course, if you can invite someone to see a movie, you can certainly invite them to dance, but taking a step back, you have to dance to be considered modern, and there's no denying that.</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>"Mr. Li, will we golf? Can you play?"</p>
<p>"The St. Anna Golf Course is considered the best, what do you think?"</p>
<p>"·········"</p>
<p>Such a question is often asked directly by your girlfriends, or in the movie theater, in the cafe, on the dance floor, or in other conversations.</p>
<p>"After this dance, shall we go and play Wee Golf? Mr. Zhang."</p>
<p>"Boy, buy two golf tickets."</p>
<p>"·········"</p>
<p>Similar conversations are often used by modern young men to woo their girlfriends.</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>Therefore, to meet the requirements of this modern era, you must be familiar with this trilogy: movies, dancing, and golf.</p>
<p>Inside, the skills of opening doors, whirlwinds, robbers, or racketeers. So I have to persuade everyone again that, when you are well-fed and have a life of wine and lights, it is best to think of a way to settle these poor friends. At the very least, you must not be stingy when it comes to giving rice or clothing. At the same time, the police force must also increase positions and patrol day and night. If they see that someone is giving alms and that there is strict prevention, they will not dare to break the law.</p>
<h3 id="e175">The Effect of Birth Control <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Yi'an</p>
<p>丨Two Points Worth Noting丨</p>
<p>This is the opinion of an expert; nowadays, many people in civilized societies, especially women, are advocating birth control, believing that a better selection of the human race can be achieved, that the poor can reduce their burden, that women in the working class can reduce the care of their children, and that women can reduce the pain of pregnancy and childbirth. Apart from the third and fourth points being factual, the other two points are quite noteworthy. Facts tell us that the result of birth control is that the birth rate of the excellent class decreases much more, while the birth rate of the non-excellent class increases relatively. Because those who know how to use birth control methods mostly belong to the excellent class, and their methods and prevention are relatively more thorough. Therefore, the birth rate of the excellent class will decrease sharply, while the birth rate of the non-excellent class will increase relatively. So, will the society and human race of the future be relatively better?</p>
<h3 id="e176">A Guilty Conscience <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— By Hongshou Du Juan</p>
<p>They anxiously helped him home, but Dongfang Sheng was already unconscious. By evening, he was somewhat lucid, and he raised his listless eyes, saying haltingly to the two of them, "…Being able to explain myself to my master by the pond could be considered fulfilling my long-held wish. After I die, please bury me by the Qiantang River, as I consider that the most suitable place for my final resting place. You two, I also know that you love each other, so please continue to love each other forever."</p>
<p>Xiaoman, upon hearing this, could only silently acknowledge it. She had no way, in this critical moment, to use the most appropriate and concise words to dispel the misunderstanding. Ouyang could only remain silent as well, his heart in a sea of remorse, knowing that this sin was entirely of his own making. Had he not shown his love for Xiaoman, he would never have caused the relapse of his close friend Dongfang Sheng's old ailment. Such a scar was truly etched too deeply into Ouyang's heart, and he would feel guilty for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>Dongfang's wife buried Dongfang Sheng by the Qiantang River. Nearby, there was a hospital founded by a Christian mission. She sold the villa and, with the maid, built another house next to the tomb. Apart from serving at the hospital during the day, she spent her mornings and evenings in the house by the tomb, hoping to atone for her life in this way.</p>
<p>After Dongfang Sheng's death, Ouyang Sheng continued his wandering life. He felt that his former family had not suffered enough. The guilt he felt for the sin he had committed against Dongfang Sheng caused him great mental anguish. Every time he recalled it, he was filled with boundless sorrow. Over the past five years, he had visited Dongfang's grave once a year to pay his respects. This time, he again walked involuntarily down this road. The road had only two rows of trees, just as it had in the past. He walked to the pond and found it even more desolate than before. Everything around him seemed to be angry at him, but he was willing to endure all the ridicule because his sin was too great.</p>
<p>× × × × × ×</p>
<p>Ouyang Sheng leaned against a tree, lost in thought, the entire history of his sin flashing before him, scene by scene, up to his current visit to the pond. He suddenly felt a slight evening breeze, which was quite chilly. The sky was gradually turning white, clearly already dawning. He did not know why he had been lost in thought all night. He walked back the way he had come, the trees on both sides nodding as if to see him off, perhaps saying, "Mr. Ouyang, you don't need to feel guilty. Strive for your future and repay your friend!" (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Art of Night Walking <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— By Long</p>
<p>丨Thinking of Ways for Poor Friends丨</p>
<p>The sharp, scissor-like north wind is attacking people again. Aside from adding layers of heavy clothing, people have practically no other way to defend themselves.</p>
<p>Does this mean that the propertied class has nothing to fear? No, no, no. The starving and freezing demons are calculating their winter food and clothing needs and intend to resolve them by falling on you. The heavier your leather coat, the greater their benefit.</p>
<p>Wherever the streetlights are dim, the place is desolate and deserted, and beyond the gaze of the police, is their sphere of influence. In the dead of night, when the wind howls like waves and the shadows of trees resemble ghosts, that is when their sentries are densely deployed, choosing people to devour. If you are careless and breach the defense line, they will treat you as a pig breaking out of its pen, brandishing their knives and proceeding directly to skin you alive. Even if the victim does not lose their life, they will surely fall ill from the cold. Therefore, I advise you all, in the winter nights, to go home early if you are out and about, and to go to bed early if you are at home, to avoid unexpected losses and frights. But then again, their food and clothing problems still need to be resolved. If they gain nothing at night, it may become a problem during the day. Nowadays, most of those who practice birth control belong to the middle and upper classes. As for the lower classes, they continue to live as usual, so their burden has not been reduced. As things stand in America, all male students who are minors and older female students in higher education have learned methods of birth control. Because more young people have learned birth control methods, sexual morality is deteriorating day by day.</p>

<p>— By Zhu Hairen</p>
<p>丨Entering the Geng Cave丨</p>
<p>Tea and snacks were served. Relying on electric torches, we were guided by Elder Chu and Director Mao, touring the various small caves on both sides. Such as the Water Curtain, the Underground Passage, the Elephant's Trunk, the Snoring Nose, and the Seven Stars, etc. The stone steps spiraled, sometimes ascending and sometimes descending. Some were deeply secluded, and the cold air pierced the skin; others had faint sunlight filtering through, as if traveling underground. Inside the caves were stone tables, stone beds, and stone benches. Two stone pillars stood upright, piercing the sky, like central river pillars. Beside the pillars was a pool of clear water, said to be piously obtained by Elder Chu, and all the cave's drinking water was taken from here. There was also a huge rock towering like a giant dragon opening its mouth, with two stones below resembling fish, one facing in and one facing out. They were appropriately named "Carp Leaping Over the Dragon Gate," truly fitting. The small caves were all secluded and tightly winding, low and narrow. Emerging from one and entering another was like a butterfly flitting through flowers, almost as if one's body had transformed into a microbe traveling through blood vessels. The stone steps in the cave numbered over a thousand, proving the scale of the construction. Elder Chu had been managing these two caves for over ten years, spending nearly 200,000 yuan, almost exhausting his fortune. Ms. Manhua also provided assistance, and her enthusiasm and determination are commendable. Alas, Elder Chu is an extraordinary man! If he could use his talents to rescue the people from fire and water, why is he so infatuated with these two caves? Could it be that his mischievous heart is still not satisfied, and the phoenix and dragon must hide their might? From this, a gentleman can observe the changes in the world. However, where there are outstanding people, there is blessed land. The two caves are even more famous thanks to Elder Chu's name, and in the years to come, anyone who passes by will surely linger and be reluctant to leave. Thus, Elder Chu's contribution will be immortal.</p>
<p>I, together with the brothers Boxiang and Bozhou, toured together, not leaving each other's side. We both sought out the hidden and explored the secluded, and took photographs to leave our footprints. In a few short hours, our heels never stopped, and not only did we not feel tired, but we lamented the shortness of time. How great is the power of the scenery to move people! Boxiang even wanted to examine its features more closely, to prepare for his future paintings, and his toil must have been even greater than mine.</p>
<p>After the tour, we climbed back to the rear cave to watch Ms. Nengzi perform sword dancing: dressed in tight-fitting clothes with narrow sleeves, she possessed ample grace. The double swords swirled, their silver light shimmering, followed by double knives, achieving the utmost in swift and agile movements. Ms. Nengzi is skilled in poetry and calligraphy and is also familiar with music, so swordplay is merely an additional skill. After the dance, Elder Chu requested calligraphy and painting as a token of appreciation. I am ashamed of my lack of talent and unable to fulfill the request, which is regrettable. As we were leaving, Elder Chu ordered firecrackers to be lit to see us off. His deep friendship and high regard left those who experienced it at a loss for how to repay him. The lingering beauty of the place made it unbearable to leave indifferently.</p>
<p>After leaving the cave, we walked back to the boat. Mr. Hu Boxiang, an old friend of Elder Chu, discussed the aesthetic construction of the cave with him along the way, tirelessly. At nine o'clock, we had dinner. During the meal, Elder Chu described the historical traces of the cave in detail, like reading a record of searching for spirits in a thousand treasures, making people happy and forgetful of fatigue. He also said that once the cave affairs were completed, he would retreat from the mundane world, to leave the secular world. Elder Chu has been cultivating his nature and seeking truth for twenty years, and has faintly realized the origin, liberated the six senses, and driven the old cart out of the burning house, which is in agreement with his inner thoughts. Someone like me, without learning, how can I glimpse even a ten-thousandth of his understanding? What a pity that in such a hasty meeting, I encountered a good teacher but could not ask for more advice, which I regret.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 27th, we left Yi and arrived in Xi in the afternoon, taking the Shanghai-Nanjing train back to Shen. During this trip, Elder Chu and his nephew, as well as his daughter Ms. Nengzi, and daughter-in-law Ms. Manhua, all entertained us warmly, which was especially touching. Director Mao took time out of his busy schedule to guide us, accompanying us along the way. The boat trip was dull, but he made us laugh and relieved our boredom, doing everything he could to entertain us. Without Mr. Mao, how could we have felt so at home? So Mr. Ao's contribution was not small. As for the transportation, accommodation, and meals along the way, they were all properly taken care of by the standing committee members of the group, Yao Yuangan and Liu Yuqi, whose enthusiasm is truly admirable. I include this to express my sincere gratitude.</p>

<h3 id="e179">The Extremely Desolate Gold Market with Declining Financial Activity <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Wait and See… Cooling Down… Early Closing</p>
<p>Unfavorable Foreign Cables for Gold. Yesterday morning's foreign cables showed London at .0625 higher, but with the Bank of America down .125 and exchange rates slightly lower, the opening was relatively flat at 798.4 taels. However, with mixed movements on the gold exchange, a slight rise in American cotton, and rising stock prices, people's confidence was weak. The market opened with constant minor gains, reaching 799.2 taels. The foreign exchange market opened with the pound sterling slightly stronger due to the rise in the main rate, while the US dollar remained flat due to unchanged private bank rates. News of an economic conference also emerged, generally favoring the prospects of silver, so it turned downstream. Banks also loosened .0625, and with the HSBC rate expected to remain unchanged, sellers were excited, but the transactions were scattered. Although a few major players took action, the volume was extremely low, falling to 796.2 taels. As the foreign exchange market slightly recovered, it fluctuated around 7 taels. The afternoon market was extremely dull, with only a few pennies of fluctuation. It closed early at 4 pm at 797.4 taels due to the unprecedented tranquility. The Central Bank seemed to be watching from the sidelines, and the market cooled down. The entire city fluctuated by only 3 taels. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Morning Market Was Extremely Stagnant. The market opened slightly lower by 1 penny at 798.4 taels. The market was quiet and calm. At the bank opening, the pound sterling was recently quoted at 1 shilling 8 pence .0625, and the US dollar at 28 yuan, both unchanged. Hengxing took the lead in making slight gains, and goods also increased in price (goods opened at 798.8 taels), gradually rising to 99.2 taels. Banks had quite an appetite, so they saw downstream, a very slow process. Generally, retail investors were selling off, and when Yuan Mao Yong also came to sell, it retreated to within 97 taels, at 6 taels and 8 pennies. Hengxing Dadecheng bought in succession, raising it by a few pennies, but retail investors were generally selling off. After struggling many times, Hengxing had to buy at the limit price of 7 taels and 2 pennies, and Hengyu and Dadecheng also came to support, so it rose slightly by .125. Although the bank's demand for February seemed loose at the opening, buyers were still seen, so it rallied to 8 taels and 3 pennies. After fluctuating slightly, it still showed a downward trend. Hwabih sold US dollars for January at .0625, already loose .0625, and satisfactory news also came from the international economic conference. Although it fell to 96.6 taels, it still once rebounded. Hengyu came to buy, adding 6 pennies, but McCallum issued US dollars for February at .125, and with the HSBC rate expected to remain unchanged, Zhifeng Yong sold, but not much, to 96.2 taels, and then returned upwards, and saw fluctuations. When the HSBC rate was announced, it remained unchanged as expected, and the trend was difficult to reverse. However, Hengyu and others still bought between 7 taels, without declining. Qingfa Yong came to buy, adding up to 7 taels and 5 pennies. After this, the foreign exchange market stabilized, and goods were slightly purchased, reaching outside 98 taels. Hengxing suddenly sold at the limit price outside 8 taels, so it retreated again to within 8 taels, from 3 pennies to 9 pennies, which was very troublesome. The market was extremely flat, and no transactions were heard in the foreign exchange market, so the gold price fluctuated between 6 taels and 7 taels for a very long time. Finally, Wanxing came to buy from 7 taels, and made a transaction at 7 taels and a half, and Hengyu also bought, so it saw 8 taels, but the transactions were few and lacked persistence, and the time was close to the noon closing. The price of goods was slightly lower, and hedging resulted in a decline to 797.5 taels at the closing. Goods slightly declined, with a close at 7 taels and 2 pennies.</p>
<p>The Afternoon Market Was Full of Calls for Closing. The market opened again at 797.5 taels, the same price as the noon closing. Goods continued to be sold off, with goods opening at only 7 taels and 2 pennies. Retail investors struggled with each other, eventually reaching 7 taels, with very few transactions, and seeing fluctuations at a price of several pennies. After rising to 97.6 taels, Changsheng Yongyuan Maohe came to sell, and Tongfeng Heng also sold at this time, falling to within 97 taels, at 6 taels and 8 pennies. Hengyu and Zhifeng Yong bought a small amount, struggling to find buyers, and rose by a few pennies, to 7 taels and 3 pennies. At this time, it was slow and sluggish, and goods were sold off from time to time, but Zhifeng Yong and Daxing Yong bought from time to time, just to make ends meet, so it retreated for a long time between 7.3 and 7.5 taels. Later, even commodity hedgers and retail investors became bored, and the market was full of calls for closing. The dullness of the market had reached its peak. Banks also felt the same, and there were few transactions. Unable to bear it, it was extended to 4 o'clock, and had to close early at 797.4 taels, with goods closing at 7.5 taels. The highest price for the day was 799.2 taels, and the lowest price was 796.2 taels, a fluctuation of only 3 taels, a boring day. As a result, it continued to fall by 1.1 taels compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The Listing Price Was Slightly Lower by About Three Taels. The listing price was due to the HSBC listing of US dollars.</p>
<p>The rate of .125 increased, totaling 27.75 yuan, and the combined gold price was 864 taels, 8 dimes and 6 cents, about 67 taels less, about 3 taels less than the previous closing. The registration for January and February was 800 taels, and the registration for March was 798 taels. The replenishment water for the morning was 799 taels, and for the afternoon was 798 taels.</p>
<p>Businesses Had No Intention of Speculating. There Were Very Few Open Transactions. Generally, sellers included Yuanmao Yong Dadecheng Zhifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang Yuanheng Changsheng Yong, as well as retail investors and goods, etc. Buyers included Hengxing Hengyu Qingfa Yong Wanxing Yuanchun Fuyu, etc. Zhifeng Yong Daxing Yong Hengyu slightly bought in the afternoon, while Yuanmao Yong Changsheng Yong Tongfeng Heng sold in the afternoon. The Dalian Gang had smooth transactions and extremely small volume. Wanxing bought a hundred or so, and the Guangdong Gang Yifeng had no movement. Shengda had very few transactions, and Hengxing also slightly bought in several tens. They did not sell in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The Spot Gold Price Increased by Twelve Taels. The spot gold market continued to be stable. The opening yesterday was an increase of twelve taels. Xin Fengxiang first sold fifty taels, which was bought by Yingfeng Heng. After that, Dadecheng first sold 210 taels, and then continued to sell 140 taels, all of which were bought by Yingfeng Heng. Because the end of the lunar year was approaching, most of the holders of spot goods slightly sold off, while Yingfeng Heng had a way out, so they bought continuously for several days, and the market saw a turnaround.</p>
<p>The Remaining Balance Was Gradually Settled. The term rollover from February to March, because there were very few left, all major players saw it was settled. Except for the Central Bank, there was not much to see. So yesterday's bureau was very light. Only Dadecheng and Yingfeng Heng did the 88 for January to February, with Dadecheng paying Yingfeng Heng (short position), estimated at five cents. The transfer price from February to March was about 1.5 to 2 taels, but no formal transactions were heard.</p>
<p>The World Economic Conference Has a Prospect of Being Established</p>
<h3 id="e180">Silver Prices Look Promising, and the Exchange Rate Hardens <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's London rate was .30625, the exchange rate between the pound and the US dollar fell by .125, and the exchange rate between the US and the UK fell by .0625. The pound sterling was recently quoted at 1 shilling and 8 pence .0625, slightly firmer than the previous close. The Bank of England rose .125, and forward silver prices both rose and fell, but the numbers were small. American cotton also rose from two pounds to six pounds. Stocks also increased by about six cents. Although the opening was flat, the US dollar was recently quoted at 28 yuan, and the opening was immediately firm. The foreign cable said that the World Economic Conference had a prospect of being established, because the work of the preparatory committee was coming to an end. Generally speaking, it may be beneficial to silver prices, so it saw a firm face. In addition, the HSBC rate was unchanged, but because there were few transactions, the market turned flat. But it was .0625 better than the initial opening. The afternoon market was extremely flat, and all banks traded with each other at the same price. Throughout the day, there was only a .0625 review. The gold industry did not hear any movement in the morning, but slightly saw blocking in the afternoon. In the banking sector, Hwabih blocked in the morning, and both purchased and blocked in the afternoon. Sassoon was the same. Zhengjin slightly ate US dollars, and bought shillings first and then sold them later. Citibank bought shillings and sold US dollars, and Bombay sold shillings. There were not many purchases and sales. The process was extremely flat. As a result of the day's fluctuations, it was .0625 firmer than the previous close. Shillings and US dollars were the same.

<p>The US dollar opened this morning with a recent bid price of 28 yuan, the same price as the previous close, because the silver market saw both rises and falls, and finally the stock market and American cotton rose. After the opening, it was immediately firm. Hwabih sold first, and Hethe January .0625, and also sold to Zhengjin the same month at the same price, McCallum sold February .125, Citibank sold March .1875, North Korea sold to Yin Company February .125, HSBC ate Citibank February .125, Anda sold January .0625, Anda bought April .3125, Zhengjin purchased Hwabih January .0625, the noon closing bid price was from 28 yuan .0625 to .25.

<p>▲Interest Rates Are Slightly Better, but Still Loose Copper Coins Change in Length▲</p>
<p>Yesterday's transactions in foreign money were not very prosperous, but the situation turned for the better because the banks had a slight appetite for buying, which seemed to be superior to the previous day. However, at the end of the lunar year, which is a traditional custom, there is naturally no opportunity to expand, so it is impossible to raise interest rates.</p>
<p>(Interest) The "foreign interest" rate in the morning market was still 7 dimes, 1 cent, 3 mils, 1 hao and 2 hu and a half. The noon market improved significantly, with 8 hao and 7 hu and a half, at 7 dimes, 1 cent and 4 mils. The "silver interest" rate in the morning and noon markets was still 2 points, with crossed out white and crossed out, and the items were very mixed and no one inquired.</p>
<p>(Copper Coin) The small Jiangnan foreign coin was 6 dimes, 3 cents and 1 mil in the morning market, and suddenly fell 7 mils at noon, at 6 dimes, 2 cents and 4 mils. The morning market transaction was 3,500 jiao, and the noon market was 10,000 jiao. The small Guangdong foreign coin was 6 dimes, 1 cent, 3 mils and 2 hao and a half in the morning market, the same price in the noon market. The morning market transaction was 75,000 jiao, and the noon market was 45,000 jiao. The copper coin was changed to a length of 1,500 texts, for a total of</p>

<p>Prices Fell by About Five to Six Cents, and the Market Was Slightly Active</p>
<p>The January Term Will Stop Trading Today to Prepare for Settlement</p>
<p>Yesterday (20th), the spot public bond market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was still deserted, and the futures market turned active. The enthusiasm of buyers and sellers was not lonely, but most of them were settled by rollover. The supply and demand situation was still flat, and the changes in each price only shifted with the supply and demand situation on the market. The trend was very chaotic, and ultimately the sale was active and the demand decreased, and the prices all fell back by several cents to eight or nine cents. Only the whole six were slightly firm. The total futures transactions were over 4.1 million in the morning and over 3 million in the afternoon, totaling 7.17 million, of which salt tax accounted for 1.54 million, and others were still good.

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Thursday (19th), the stock market was still idle. Most of the trading in the market was still done by professional speculators. The market rose slightly due to the strength of public bonds and wheat. Generally, speculators expected that the federal government would soon issue short-term treasury bills, and the firmness of wheat was due to the lack of rainfall in the southwest, the strength of the Liverpool wheat market, and the reduced imports from the Soviet Union and the Balkan Peninsula. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 620,000 shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>Thirty Industrial Stocks 61.02 Up 0.66</p>
<p>Twenty Railroad Stocks 27.38 Up 0.40</p>

<p>Mediocre American Cotton Lacks Distinct Features</p>
<p>Many Speculators Liquidate Cotton Yarn Positions</p>
<p>The yarn market remains sluggish with a relaxed atmosphere. Overseas cotton yarn conditions are lackluster, weakening confidence. Some speculators are liquidating positions, and sales are becoming more sluggish. As the end of the year approaches, account settlements are causing further delays. However, buyers believe raw cotton prices are unlikely to fall significantly, anticipating a rise in the spring. The future direction depends on actual demand.</p>
<p>People's Standard Market Declines Continuously. The People's Standard market opened with weak foreign cotton, and general speculators sold off their positions, further weakening the market. Prices for all months fell by four, five, or six cents. This was the final day for the current month, with receiving parties mainly being banks engaged in arbitrage. However, the market remained soft, with the closing price at 143.1 taels, four cents higher than December. Prices for other months fell by one to four cents. Total daily trading volume was 17,900 bales. Of these, Sui Long sold 900 bales, Tong Xing 650 bales, Yu Feng 900 bales, and Chang Feng 400 bales. Ji Feng bought 400 bales, Yu Da 500 bales, Tai Xing 400 bales, and Shen Ji 900 bales. Closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>People's Standard Closing Prices, Gains, Losses, and Balances: April 147.0, down 6, 39,900</p>
<p>January 143.1, down 8, 13,950 May 147.9, up 6, 27,100</p>
<p>February 144.7, up 7, 43,150 June 148.6, up 5, 9,450</p>
<p>March 145.9, up 8, 53,050 Total 186,600</p>
<p>Cantonese Merchants Continue Spot Purchases, Spot Yarn Sales Remain Good. Cantonese merchants in the Southern port remain the most active buyers. Daily purchases by various groups totaled 712 bales, with stable prices. Purchase volumes for each group were as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 415 Shantou 25 Inland 57</p>
<p>Xiamen 10 Sichuan 125 Changsha 100</p>
<p>The cotton market remains sluggish due to mediocre American cotton. Many speculators are unwinding positions. With the settlement period approaching and cotton yarn trading suspended for a week, unpredictable foreign cotton movements are causing more liquidations and increased downward pressure. However, buyers are holding firm due to low inventory levels. Nevertheless, 8,000 bales of coarse Tianjin cotton arrived at the docks yesterday (mostly handled by the Shenxin factory). Considering the current situation, the market is unlikely to break out of its current range-bound pattern in the short term.</p>
<p>Sluggish Zheng Standard The Zheng Standard market opened with the lingering effects of the previous day's weakness. Market sentiment remained weak, with fewer buyers. Prices for all months fell by 0.05 to 0.015 taels. The second session in the afternoon also declined, with a slight rise at the close. Ultimately, prices for all months fell by 0.05 to 0.01 taels. Total daily trading volume was 21,400 dan. Geng Feng sold 2,900 dan, Zhang Da 1,100 dan, Ming De 1,000 dan, Yi Yu 2,100 dan, and He Shen 900 dan. Ming Hua bought 1,400 dan, Da Chang 800 dan, and Chang Feng 1,800 dan. Closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Gains, Losses, Balances: May 342.0, down 1.5, 60,600</p>

<p>April 339.5, down 1.5, 97,700</p>
<p>Stagnant Actual Demand Spot cotton demand has ceased, with factories not processing. Falling cotton futures are further reducing trading volume. The source of supply is estimated at 300 bales of Tonghua cotton.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to a lack of sellers, strong Wall Street activity spurred reactionary buying in American cotton. The market was quiet but firm, with futures rising 2 to 6 points and spot prices rising 5 points. British cotton futures rose 3-4 points, while spot prices fell 3 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 3 points. Indian cotton was mediocre, with Pingguoer falling 0.25 rupees, Bairoxi falling 1.25 rupees, and Aomula falling 1.5 rupees.

<h3 id="e190">Rice Market Dull Amidst War Rumors <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>▲Only a Few Transactions... Business Depends on Rising Prices▲</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, over 30 boats arrived at the South Market, with scattered transactions and lackluster sales due to the approaching end of the year. Although over 1,000 shi of bundled rice arrived, it could not reverse the declining trend, and prices continued to fall by 3-4 jiao. However, the supply of Qingjiao thin rice was limited, allowing it to maintain its price. Su Tong, Chang, and Nangang rice prices slightly decreased by 3-4 jiao, and Bianyuan rice was unavailable. Yinyuan softened. Only one boat of Qingjiao Duzi arrived in the entire market, commanding a premium due to its scarcity, with prices ranging from 10 yuan to 9.9 yuan.</p>
<p>▲Over 10 boats arrived at the North Market yesterday, but sales were extremely sluggish. Merchants were eager to close their books, causing prices to drop by another 3-4 jiao. Gaobaijing rice from the North decreased by more than 1 jiao, with medium and lower grades decreasing by 3-4 jiao. Early rice and thin rice also fell by 2 jiao. Yangxian and Yinyuan rice were generally weak. Baiyuan Dujian was stable, while Buxian and Kexian were fixed.</p>
<p>▲Kexian rice was even more sluggish. Although there were over 40,000 bags in the market, some were purchased by speculators hoping for higher prices next year, while others were owned by Hunan and Jiangxi customers and merchants who also planned to hold out until prices rose. While Kexian merchants were willing to buy, it was difficult to obtain supplies. Only a few small traders, due to their limited capital, were selling as soon as they received goods. However, Kexian sales were mainly limited to Fujian province, which still had some demand, but most merchants had also closed their books, waiting for higher prices. With both buyers and sellers lacking enthusiasm, the market was particularly quiet. Yesterday, only the local street merchants sold 397 bags of Hunan machine oil rice. There were no transactions by Fujian merchants. The price was 9.19 yuan, a slight improvement of 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day. However, most sellers were determined to hold out until after the new year, expecting high oil rice to reach over 9.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Foreign Wheat Prices Remain Low... Actual Sales Merchants Gradually Selling Off</p>
<p>After the flour market opened yesterday morning, prices for all months appeared stable, as foreign wheat prices rebounded by 0.02 to 0.04 yuan. Initial market sentiment was slightly boosted, about 0.0075 yuan better than the previous day's closing price. However, after the second session, prices gradually softened as actual sales merchants slightly sold off their positions, causing the market to decline again. When the afternoon session opened, prices for both near and distant months were unstable, as current foreign wheat prices remained low. Australian wheat was quoted at 3.6 taels, and Canadian No. 3 wheat was quoted at 3.56 taels. This situation severely dampened the enthusiasm of speculators. Moreover, actual sales merchants continued to sell off their positions, suggesting limited prospects. Although Henan merchants were buying, their actions were ignored, leading to a general decline in the market. Ultimately, the current month was down 0.0075 yuan, February was down 0.0075 yuan, March was down 0.005 yuan, April was down 0.0125 yuan, May was down 0.0075 yuan, and June was down 0.005 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Madman (3) <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>At this time, everyone was paying attention to the dog and its puppies, so they didn't pay much attention to the madman. Unexpectedly, the madman picked up a large stone and aimed it at the dog, hitting it on the head. At that moment, the women all cried out, and the children ran out from the crowd. The dog, which was in labor, struggled for a few moments before becoming completely still. However, the puppies that had already been born did not seem to feel any sadness and were still moving in their mother's embrace, hoping to suck a few drops of milk from her slightly warm breast. But the mother was already dead.</p>
<p>No one knew when, but the madman had already left. All that remained were the mother dog and several other women. The two lepers were also staring blankly at the dead dog, muttering softly,</p>
<p>"Damn madman!"</p>
<p>But the dog was dead, and that was that. The puppies would soon die too. Although this might tug at people's heartstrings, it would only be for a moment. The women soon began talking about the madman again.</p>
<p>They talked for a long time. The two lepers were now listening to the dog's owner saying:</p>
<p>"But Wang Lao Si was a rather ambitious person, and he spoke very rationally. When he had nothing to do in the evenings, he would sit at my door and chat. He often said: 'I'm getting older every day, and I still don't have a wife. If this continues, won't my line be cut off? But after all these years of hardship, I've finally found someone. If the ancestors protect me, and I can marry her and have a son or daughter, I'll die content.'</p>
<p>"So, he made up his mind to take advantage of this year's good harvest. If the gods bless us with a good yield, he would sell the excess next month and buy a new quilt so that his wife would have a clean bed when she came. But then he discussed with me:</p>
<p>'I still owe Uncle Wu's family several loads of old rent. Should I pay it back or not? His family's accountant has already come to urge me several times.'</p>
<p>'Just owe it for another year,' I said. 'Go to Uncle Wu and plead with him nicely. He's been an official and is literate and reasonable. Besides, Auntie Wu is a kind person who prays and does good deeds. She'll probably take pity on you.'</p>
<p>"I said this to him, and he thought it made sense. ... Who knew that someone so sensible would suddenly go mad? Heaven really has no eyes!"</p>
<p>Everyone listened in silence, not knowing what to say. Then the dog's owner seemed to want to say something more, her lips moving, so the two lepers quickly chimed in:</p>
<p>"Wu Lao Si was fine when he went to my master's house to pay the rent the day before yesterday."</p>
<p>Perhaps this sentence was not loud enough to attract much attention. At this time, someone else was talking about how the government soldiers had raped Wang Lao Si's wife years ago, and how his wife had been so chaste that she refused to submit, and was eventually killed in a flurry of knives. But because the people there didn't pay attention to him, the two lepers angrily ran away. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e206">"Don't Move" vs. "Must Move" <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Xingzhi</p>
<p>On December 7th of the year before last, Mr. Dai Jitao published an "Open Letter to Educators and Parents of Students Throughout the Country." The most alarming sentences in the letter were: "Saplings cannot grow if they are free; young people cannot become adults if they are free." Recently, Mr. Zhou Fohai, the Director of Education of Jiangsu Province, also published a "Letter to Parents of Students Throughout Jiangsu," which contains many thought-provoking remarks, such as: "Resisting teachers and violating discipline, taking rebellion as the spirit of revolution, acting recklessly and wantonly, taking arbitrariness as the development of personality... As a result, there are trends of expelling leaders and choosing teachers in schools, and claims of non-filial revolution at home." The arguments in Dai's and Zhou's letters are exactly the same, and Zhou's writing is actually better and more appealing than Dai's in terms of vigor and sharpness. I think that "old people" will definitely toast to it, while "young people" will definitely stick out their tongues after reading it.</p>
<p>From Dai's letter to Zhou's letter, we can clearly see the current government's demands on the people. The true meaning of this demand is "internal stability," and "rectifying academic conduct" and "〇〇" are actually two sides of the same coin.</p>
<p>Originally, since the September 18th Incident the year before last, not only young people, but almost everyone has been "moving" and "changing." The entire society has been turbulent in the waves of unrest. However, this turbulent situation is not accidental; it is the result of the combined pressure of foreign aggression and internal strife, and also the trend of a turning point in the times.</p>
<p>"Stillness!" "Stability!" "No freedom allowed!" "Those who are free!" These are the calls of Mr. Dai and Mr. Zhou, and also the calls of the government. However, from the perspective of thousands of years of history, both in China and abroad, people will never give up freedom, and the times have never accepted the order to "turn back." If you don't allow movement, what if the times insist on moving?</p>

<p>— Zheng Boqi</p>
<p>A Sketch of Shanghai Petty Bourgeois Life</p>
<p>The tram is about to leave. A jumps on the car lightly, pushes open the door, and sees B at a glance.</p>
<p>B, A (almost at the same time): Ah! Haven't seen you in a long time! Haven't seen you in a long time! Where are you going?</p>
<p>A (sitting next to B): I'm going to ×× Bridge. And you?</p>
<p>B: I'm just going up ahead. Haven't seen you in a long time!</p>
<p>A: Haven't seen you in a long time! How's business?</p>
<p>B: So-so. The market's too sluggish now. Are you doing well?</p>
<p>A: Just muddling through. Business is very difficult now!</p>
<p>B: Come visit me when you're free.</p>
<p>A: Okay. Please come over when you're free too. I have a lot of good friends there.</p>
<p>B: (At this time, A buys a ticket) What's your phone number there?</p>
<p>A: We just moved, and the phone hasn't been installed yet.</p>
<p>B: It's annoying to install a phone now! It takes at least half a year.</p>
<p>A: We have connections, and it'll be installed soon.</p>
<p>B: My phone number is 43675! Call me first when you want to come.</p>
<p>A (takes out a notebook): Please write it down there. Ah! I'm sorry! What's your surname? I forgot.</p>
<p>B (writing at once): Yes, yes. I'll write it all down for you.</p>
<p>A (looking at the notebook): Yes. Mr. Wang, I'm so stupid! Didn't we meet at the dog track last time?</p>
<p>B: You were with your wife.</p>
<p>A: That's right, that's right. She lost terribly that day, it was so funny.</p>
<p>B: What kind of business are you doing this year?</p>
<p>A: This year, I'm only buying and not selling. I buy whatever's cheap. If iron is cheap, I buy iron; if piece goods fall, I buy piece goods. I don't even use cash for the transactions, I just buy it first. Then I'll sell it when the price goes up. This way of doing things is still good.</p>
<p>B: That's one way to do it.</p>
<p>A: It's always better to work for yourself than to help others. In this day and age, it's good enough just to muddle through.</p>
<p>B: In this day and age, who isn't just muddling through? Doing it your way, you can save on expenses.</p>
<p>A: Sigh! Don't even mention expenses. I have two families, and each one needs 300 yuan a month, so that's 600 yuan in total. And neither one is willing to take less. All year long, I'm busy, but I'm just busy supporting my families.</p>
<p>B: Isn't that the truth? It's not easy to support even one family, let alone two.</p>
<p>A: What can I do! When I first came out of school, I was in a foreign firm, earning less than twenty yuan a month, and still had to save ten or so. Now I earn more, but it's still never enough to cover expenses.</p>
<p>B: Alas! We're all in the same boat. Ah, I've arrived, I need to get off. Come over and visit when you're free.</p>
<p>B gets off the car hurriedly. A leans against the carriage wall, looks out the window, and whistles the tune "Love Me Tonight."</p>
<p>Ticket seller (walking up to A): Sir, you've gone past your stop, please pay an extra fare.</p>
<p>A: What! Have I arrived already? How much do I need to add?</p>
<p>Ticket seller: Where are you going, exactly?</p>
<p>A: I'm going to ×× Bridge.</p>
<p>Ticket seller: Please add a short-distance ticket, seven cents.</p>
<p>A: Okay. It's only half a stop. I'll get off now.</p>
<p>Ticket seller: I can't let you off without paying, I'll get punished.</p>
<p>A (angry): Why didn't you tell me earlier? I refuse to pay! Are you the only ones allowed to cheat? (Suddenly softening) Let's just call it even.</p>
<p>The car has arrived at ×× Bridge. A jumps off.</p>
<p>Ticket seller: Cheat? Have I ever cheated you? (To the outside of the window) Wearing such nice Western clothes, but all you know how to do is cheat, damn it...!</p>

<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Snowflakes are falling.</p>
<p>The sky is like a giant winnowing fan, scattering flour. The ground, the walls, the roofs, are all white, the accumulated powder is an inch thick.</p>
<p>Opening the door, a gust of cold wind hits the face, causing a sharp pain. Snowflakes cover the body, like cotton wadding.</p>
<p>Holding an umbrella, walking on the road, the snow has been trampled into mud, making it slippery.</p>
<p>The roadside trees, French plane trees, have shed all their leaves, leaving only bare branches reaching towards the sky, snow pressing on the bare branches, desolate.</p>
<p>The street cleaner, holding a long-handled broom, bends over to sweep the snow. Hot air comes out of his mouth and nose, like two streaks of white smoke.</p>
<p>A foreign lady, in a thick fur coat, high heels, walks across the road with a clatter, leading a Pekingese dog, its mouth gnawing on a piece of raw beef, a brass bell under its neck jingles and jangles.</p>
<p>The dog, of course, is luckier than the street cleaner.</p>
<p>On Hualong Road, under a large umbrella, several coolies squeeze together, warmly enjoying their breakfast—"Lao Doufu Jiang, how many coppers for a bowl?"</p>
<p>A maid puts a copper kettle on the stove, turns around and warms her hands. The back of her hand is swollen like bread, her fingers swollen like red carrots.</p>
<p>"Beep beep beep!" A car rushes through the snow and mud, flying forward. Inside the car, a trendy couple sits closely together, their hearts and dreams in the thirty-third heaven.</p>
<p>Xiafei Road is like falling into an ice pot, not even half a ghost. Only two or three White Russians, shivering, huddle in the alleyway.</p>
<p>Snowflakes are falling, like the sky shaking a winnowing fan and scattering flour.</p>
<p>The air is fifteen degrees below zero.</p>
<p>Not even a beggar can be seen, tomorrow the newspapers will definitely report several frozen corpses.</p>
<p>The snowy French Concession, how cold! How quiet!</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>In the dark night, I walk forward on the snowy ground!</p>
<p>Snow, icy snow, keeps drifting onto my head, hitting my body, hitting my face, cold, cold. Wind, piercing wind, keeps roaring in my ears, scraping against my body, scraping against my face, cold, cold.</p>
<p>However, I must move forward, I will never rest, and besides, where can I rest?</p>
<p>On the road, all I see is a silver glow, reflecting the desolate streetlights, a dim yellow. However, I do not feel fear, nor do I feel desolate, I only advance towards the future, who cares about it, that expanse, white and boundless, white and boundless.</p>
<p>Occasionally, I think of my hometown. Oh! Hometown, it's like this too, no lights, no moon, also such goose feather snow, white and boundless. My brothers are buried in the snowdrifts, my sisters die in the freezing cold. Cold, cold ah, I tremble, I am distressed... But not far away, I glimpse a fire, yo! That fire, is my hope, so I still move forward, I do not lose heart.</p>
<p>The wind blows hard, the snow flies densely, advance, advance,</p>
<p>In the distance, a few rooster crows tell me that the night is deep, and the cold has congealed. Here, darkness is approaching light, advance, advance, advance!</p>
<p>Oh! I advance, I dare not rest, and besides, where can I rest?</p>

<p>She was really wiping her tears. Where did such cheap tears come from? She wasn't a movie star; she couldn't just cry whenever she wanted.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Zeng!..."</p>
<p>"........................................"</p>
<p>But she just held a snow-white handkerchief to rub her eyes, ignoring him. He knew that she was clearly changing her battle plan because her offensive had failed, switching from offense to defense.</p>
<p>"She's taking a defensive stance. What should I do? Take the offensive? That wouldn't be appropriate! She has reinforcements. If I take the offensive, I'll definitely be completely defeated. I still have to take a defensive stance, and not just a defensive stance, but also non-resistance!..."</p>
<p>He pondered for a while. In the end, he still couldn't restrain himself.</p>
<p>"Mrs. Zeng, why bother?"</p>
<p>He reached out his right hand and gently patted her shoulder.</p>
<p>"I'm not happy!"</p>
<p>She shrugged her shoulders slightly.</p>
<p>"I'm not angry. But I have my own worries..."</p>
<p>"You're angry! You're angry at me! You're clearly angry at me!"</p>
<p>"If you want to say that, what can I do?"</p>
<p>"You have to promise me that you won't be angry like that again. You have no idea how heartbroken I am when I see you angry, Mr. Lin!"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay. I won't be angry again."</p>
<p>"Then I'll be happy."</p>
<p>She smiled again.</p>
<p>He thought, if he was determined to love her, he should take this opportunity to show her his feelings, and he would definitely gain her sympathy. Otherwise, it could be said that she was clearly hinting at pursuing his sympathy.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Keeping Up Appearances Is Important <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Gong</p>
<p>So poor that they can't pay the rent, with no rice for dinner, they secretly pawn their quilts and cotton robes. Yet, the old madam, the eldest daughter, the carriage driver, the servants—all the trappings of prosperous times—are still indispensable. When a party invitation arrives, even if it's guaranteed to lose money, they have to make a trip to the Little Garden. Even though their pockets are full of pawn tickets, they can't refuse to sit down and pretend, claiming a headache. This is supposedly called "keeping up appearances." As a Shanghainese who can't even dream of being a real person, if you don't grit your teeth and do this, you'll lose face and bring shame to your ancestors for generations.</p>
<p>The imperialists, clearly wanting to maintain and expand all their legal and illegal rights, desperately woo the aggressors and oppress the invaded. Yet, they insist on painting their faces red and white, twisting and turning as they sing a few lines about "morality" and "justice," dangling the bait in front of the invaded. Today, a telegram says Country A favors Country B; tomorrow, a dispatch says Country A suppresses Country B. They keep holding meaningless meetings, while the actual problems are left to the Four Heavenly Kings riding the clouds, suspended eight feet in the air. In reality, the so-called favoring or suppressing is just a show. To put it bluntly, imperialists always help imperialists. Don't expect them to help weak nations. But why do imperialists put on such airs? Supposedly, this is also called "keeping up appearances." If they didn't act soft and hard, hard and soft, this large imperialist group would lose its prestige and never be able to reopen the old shop.</p>
<p>Indeed, from individuals to international relations, everyone sees "face" as the number one key to self-cultivation, family management, national governance, and world peace. "A scholar will not bend his waist for five pecks of rice," "Starving to death is a small matter, losing integrity is a big deal"... the spirit of "face" is vividly on display. In reality, this situation is perfectly described by a saying from Pudong: "Putting a golden flower on a mangy head, bearing the pain to look good." Pudong people also have another saying that is very relevant to the way people live: "With an old face, the belly is full." People who worship hypocrisy will definitely scold this saying as "shameless." In fact, "poverty cannot be hidden, ugliness cannot be hidden." Why bother desperately "putting a golden flower on a mangy head"? That is truly "dying for face and suffering in life!"</p>

<h3 id="e212">Skin Diseases <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Sheng Yi</p>
<p>Skin diseases are the most common ailments we humans suffer from. Even if we don't have other illnesses, almost seventy to eighty percent of us have skin diseases. Now, I will describe the most common skin diseases in detail...</p>
<p>The most common skin diseases are roughly six types: ringworm, moles, spots, blisters, miliaria, and calluses. (1) Ringworm: There are two types of ringworm, scabies and favus, which are the most serious. Scabies, also known as scabies, is caused by a type of scabies mite that lives on the skin. Small blisters appear where the mites live, causing intense itching. People often scratch, and after scratching, scabs form, which is called dry scabies. If it becomes infected with pus, it is called wet scabies. It is very easy to transmit to people who sleep together. The treatment is to use sulfur, alcohol, talc, soap, lard, etc. to make an ointment, and apply it once a day until it is cured. Favus, also known as tinea capitis, is caused by a type of favus fungus that lives on the head. The area where the fungus lives first develops small, circular spots, then small blisters, and then forms small, yellow plates that emit a foul odor, causing hair to fall out and intense itching. People often scratch, even until it bleeds. The treatment is to first shave the hair, apply oil to the yellow plates to soften them, then peel them off, and then apply mercuric chloride and alcohol, and the disease will heal. (2) Moles: There are three types of moles: flesh moles, cinnabar moles, and blue moles. Flesh moles are raised on the skin, have no special color, and vary in shape and size. This is due to the development of dermal papillae. They can be cut off with a knife and then coated with an antiseptic, and they will heal. Cinnabar moles and blue moles are slightly raised compared to the skin and are mostly round. They are caused by the protrusion of the dermal papillae under the skin, as well as the deposition of pigment; red ones are called cinnabar moles, and blue ones are called blue moles. These moles are not harmful to the skin, but if you want to remove them, you can mix nitric acid or lime with blister beetle and apply it to the mole. After a few days, the mole will fall off. (3) Spots: There are three types of spots: birthmarks, freckles, and white spots. Birthmarks are present when a child is born. Red ones are called cinnabar birthmarks, and blue ones are called blue birthmarks. The size varies, and they do not protrude from the skin. Freckles are mostly black and often appear on the face. The size and number also vary, and they do not protrude from the skin. These two types of spots gradually develop due to the proliferation of pigment. White spots are white in color. The reason is the opposite of birthmarks and freckles. Instead, the pigment in the spotted area atrophies. They usually occur between the ages of ten and thirty, and the size varies. There are also cases where the entire body is white after birth, which is also a variation of white spots. (4) Acne: Acne often appears on the face and is caused by the accumulation of sebum in the sebaceous glands, but there is often a type of hair follicle mite that lives there at the same time. It usually occurs during adolescence. If it doesn't ulcerate, it is called acne, or comedones. If it ulcerates, it is called pustules. The treatment is to break it open with a needle and squeeze out the contents |pus and blood|, and then apply an antiseptic to heal. (5) Miliaria, also known as heat rash, is caused by the skin being soaked in sweat in hot weather, resulting in small red bumps that are constantly itchy. The treatment is to wash frequently when sweating a lot, and after washing, apply alcohol or floral water, and then use a powder that easily absorbs moisture to dust on the skin, and it will heal. (6) Calluses are hard skin that grows on the palms or soles of the feet, caused by the friction between the hands and feet and hard objects. Although they can be cut off with a knife, they will soon grow back. There is no way to cure them. There are also people who like to wear tight shoes, which causes hard skin to develop on the toes, causing pain when walking, which is called a corn. It is similar to a callus, but it has a central depression, which can be distinguished slightly. The treatment is to cut it off with a knife, or use medicine to soften it, but you must not wear tight shoes again in the future, and this will heal on its own, otherwise it will be ineffective.</p>

<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Getting off the tram, I have to turn into a long and dark alley to get to my house. Because I've walked it so many nights, I know how many steps it takes to reach the telephone pole sticking out in the middle of the road; where the puddles form after rain.</p>
<p>Last night, getting off the tram and turning into the alley entrance, I saw a crowd of people gathered around the trash can in the distance, each holding a kerosene lamp in their hand. This place, I never see people or lights when I return. "I wonder what happened?" I quickly walked a few steps, wondering.</p>
<p>"They're weighing it to play the lottery," said a worker-looking man cheerfully:</p>
<p>Hearing this, I had already guessed half of it in my heart. I walked closer to the trash can and looked behind the crowd, and sure enough, it was a dead child. "It's a boy" said the Suzhou amah sadly: but most of them agreed with the worker's proposal, preparing to make a fortune.</p>
<p>I left this group of people, avoided the telephone pole, jumped over the puddle, opened the back door, and groped my way into my bedroom in the dark. I sat down on the nearest chair, thinking, aimlessly thinking, forgetting to turn on the light.</p>
<p>This is not the first time I've encountered such a thing. Is it the child of a poor family? Impossible! No matter how poor the family is, and no matter how many children there are; even if they are born, the parents cannot raise them. But are there such cruel parents in the world who throw their own flesh and blood next to the trash can? They wouldn't give it to childless people, or send it to a charity. Say the child died as soon as it was born, that's also impossible. They would definitely cover it with something, or bury it in the wilderness. Originally, "death" is what people fear the most, and our country also has the saying, "entering the soil is peace", how can one throw away an innocent newborn child randomly? So I was sure it was an illegitimate child.</p>
<p>Thinking of illegitimate children, "illegitimate children" themselves are innocent, and the guilt should be attributed to their parents. But why does society arbitrarily harm illegitimate children? Is it the people who create the crime who are to blame, or is the fate of illegitimate children like this?</p>
<p>"Freedom of love", even country girls now know. China is like a small colt that hasn't learned to walk yet. Suddenly, a whip is lashed on its butt, so it strives, or rather, desperately runs forward randomly. As a result, under the name of "freedom of love", a great sin is created.</p>
<p>The city, especially, is a den of iniquity, all kinds of temptations and threats surrounding young people. University students talk about love, carriage drivers talk about love, the daughters of landlords talk about love, boatmen talk about love. The grand culmination of love is the illegitimate child thrown by the trash can.</p>
<p>The map of Guanwai has changed color. People who are drunk with freedom of love, create your illegitimate children! Perhaps in the future, even more names like "raising girls to save the nation" will be discovered.</p>

<h3 id="e215">Hesitation About Marrying a Prostitute <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>When I was fourteen years old, I dropped out of school due to poverty at home. I didn't get a job at the Shanghai × Money House until I was sixteen, after many requests. Unfortunately, last October, I was subjected to various stimuli. As someone with a weak will, I had the ill-conceived idea of seeking comfort in a drinking woman. Later, I met the prostitute Su Zhen, who knew that she would never have hope of getting ahead in this lowly profession. For the sake of her life, she gently followed me. Because I knew she was capable and knew what suffering was, I swore never to betray her, and we became confidants. It has been three months since we agreed on a lifelong alliance. But in my mind, there are always a few questions | (1) This matter has not been agreed to by my parents. If it is discovered that she is a prostitute, then it will definitely be strongly opposed. (2) Marriage must have a public ceremony; marrying a prostitute, I fear that I will be despised by relatives and friends, or it will affect my position. (3) She has been engaged in this lowly profession for four years. Will there be any harm to future fertility? (4) She is already twenty-three this year, but I am only nineteen years old. With such a difference in age, will there be physiological problems? (5) My financial ability is not yet able to bear the cost of marriage. She is willing to continue this life for one year, so that she can save some money. Will this plan work? (6) If I intend to break up with her, then we have deep affection for each other. How can the scars on our souls be erased? | Therefore, I hesitate to decide. I hope you can teach me. I respectfully wish you</p>
<p>Good health, Hong Yong, respectfully.</p>
<p>Editor's note; Prostitutes are generally considered to be the most lowly: indeed, they can not only make young people who go to pleasure-seeking degenerate; even they themselves have the danger of "being like entering a stall selling spoiled fish, and not smelling the stench for a long time." But this cannot be generalized. There are also not a few who are capable and know what suffering is, and who are determined to be good. This is the so-called extraordinary woman in the brothel. As for whoring and sleeping with prostitutes, it is originally willing to enter the lower class, which is not enough to be a lesson. But once tired of wandering and knowing to return, wanting to find an opponent to entrust his dissolute soul, it is also not the first step to turning back. Therefore, we dare not rashly agree to marrying a prostitute; but under special circumstances, it can also be acknowledged.</p>
<p>According to Hong Jun's own account, "the family is poor." Counting from the time he started studying, it has only been three years, and his "financial ability is not yet able to bear the cost of marriage." Then, how was the cost of pleasure-seeking in the past raised? Have you ever stolen from the company? But I want to ask Hong Jun to reflect on himself. If so, then you must work hard in the future and find a way to make up for it. This marriage can only be cut off with heartache, otherwise, once it is discovered, you will have nowhere to stand. Although we dare not "judge the gentleman with the heart of a villain," but for the sake of being loyal to our duties, we do not feel that our words are too direct.</p>
<p>If there is no situation described above, then we can end Hong Jun's past mistakes with the four words "let bygones be bygones." Let's discuss the questions he raised.</p>
<p>The first and second questions at the beginning can only be dealt with by "lying." We know deeply that lying is immoral; but in this stubborn society, seeking people's understanding is useless even if you shout until your throat is hoarse, so there is no better solution other than lying. It is good to say that there is no obvious difference between a prostitute and a woman from a good family! The third question depends on the doctor's assessment, and the procedures should have been resolved before the engagement. Hong Jun neglected it because he was infatuated, which makes us doubt his observation of "knowing what suffering is and being determined to be good." While this big mistake has not been made, I hope Hong Jun will use a calm and sharp eye to observe again. The fourth question does not need to be considered, because the age difference between the couple is three or four years, which is very common and will not cause harm. The fifth question is definitely not possible. Ordinary people say that a prostitute's life is like being in a fire pit; how can one save people from fire and water, and can it be delayed? Moreover, "those who are near vermilion get stained red, and those who are near ink get stained black," and the other party's character is afraid to be affected. As for the economic difficulties, then there is only the method of economizing on food and clothing. Fortunately, the other party is a woman who can endure hardship | As for the sixth question, then it is fundamentally contradictory. We believe that if after consideration, it is considered marriageable, then why say breaking up; if it is considered unmarriageable, then the foundation of love is fundamentally lost, and even if you break up with her, there will be no pain.</p>

<p>"Oh, I understand"! Boss Sang suddenly realized. "He must have gone in last night."</p>
<p>"More than last night, it's like this every night. You just didn't pay attention."</p>
<p>"Strange, strange! The old one is his sister-in-law, and the young one is his niece. Who exactly is his opponent?"</p>
<p>"The old one is thirty-six this year, and the young one is eighteen. His age is right in the middle | I heard that he is exactly twenty-seven years old, and he is suitable for both. If you ask 'who is with whom'? No one can figure it out, unless they themselves." 'You used to get so much grace from the deceased first wife, and Mao Sheng is her beloved child. We see him being bullied by others, can't we think of a way to rescue him?"</p>
<p>"To be honest, I had expected them to attack Mao Sheng a long time ago."</p>
<p>"This child" Boss Sang asked very anxiously, "Where is he now? Don't let him be homeless."</p>
<p>The proprietress had peeled the broad beans and secretly crooked her mouth at Boss Sang. Boss Sang understood and followed her into the room to discuss their plan.</p>
<p>(2) The Old Master's Affection is Long, the Wife's Temper is Short</p>
<p>In the Jiangnan region, in the homes of gentry families of the third class or lower, the wall between the first main gate is half rented out to tailors to open clothing shops. However, it is not necessarily because the master is greedy for a few limited rents that the wall is rented out; because the wall of the family, unless there are weddings and funerals, is usually empty and useless. The houses where the masters live, eat, and drink are all deeply hidden behind the third or fourth hall. To take care of the chores at the gate, it is necessary to set up a gatehouse. Gentry of the third class or lower rarely have the opportunity to interact with dignitaries. Hiring a gatekeeper to answer the door only means sitting in the door all day to eat and doze off. Occasionally, when a distinguished guest comes to the door, having someone with sleepy eyes come out to greet them is not very dignified. It is better to rent it out to someone to open a tailor shop, which can earn rent and also take care of the gate, so that thieves cannot covet it. Isn't it convenient?</p>
<p>Sang Aqiang's tailor shop is set up in the wall of someone's house. The surname Xia used to be his old customer, but now he has become his landlord. The Xia family is a big clan in this city. Even with this house owner's branch, there are five direct brothers. The second Master Xia, named Zhongnan, is considered the most capable among his brothers, and he has earned the most family property. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e220">Red-Haired Woman Causes a Scene at the Film Studio <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Xun Nan</p>
<p>Clara Bow, the red-haired actress, has always been known for her uninhibited nature since childhood. This time, Fox Film Corporation invited her to film "Wild Girl" (Call Her Savage), precisely to utilize her lively and unrestrained temperament. Unexpectedly, this wonderful person did a wonderful thing. One day at the film studio, she displayed her fierce feminine power and got into a brawl with a female supporting actress. It is feared that this scene might become reality and perhaps even be incorporated as an interesting interlude in "Wild Girl." Because such a genuine fight, this kind of fierce battle with punches and kicks between two women, can only be performed by two extremely shrewish women with deep hatred, and can only happen when they are fighting over a man. Therefore, how could the director lightly let go of such an extraordinary performance when he encountered it?</p>
<p>The story is like this: This day, they were filming an extremely tense scene. In this scene, Clara was supposed to meet her rival, Thelma Todd, in a dance hall. They were supposed to argue and fight due to a disagreement. However, this was all just acting, not real. So Clara and Thelma were both wholeheartedly following the script. But each of them had their own hidden agenda, wanting to show off a little. Thelma later said to people, "This segment is a rare opportunity for me to shine in the entire film, so how could I let it go?"</p>
<p>This is the reason why the two of them were fighting so seriously. What kind of person is Clara? How could she let someone else take the spotlight? Moreover, she is the lead actress of this film, so there is even less room for her to be forgiving. So, when Thelma was wholeheartedly trying to steal the limelight, she stopped acting and started a real fight with Thelma.</p>
<p>Thelma said afterwards, "I don't even know how intense the fight was. But later, I felt that a large clump of my hair had been twisted off by her. After a while, I also had a large clump of red hair in my hand. Later, I kicked with all my might, and she fell to the ground, not moving."</p>
<p>Clara suffered a great loss this time. She received a kick in the stomach from Thelma. As for the extent of her injuries, she refused to admit it herself. It is said that she wrote a letter to Thelma afterwards, saying "We'll meet again someday," but Fox Film Corporation vehemently denied this.</p>
<p>While the two of them were fighting fiercely, creating a chaotic scene, the cameramen were flustered and the director was extremely anxious.</p>
<p>Director Mr. Delen, as if mad and drunk, pulled the cameraman and asked, "Did you capture it?"</p>
<p>"Of course, but it doesn't seem like I was intentionally filming it. I just felt my hand shaking automatically. I really lost myself."</p>

<h3 id="e221">Worth Noting...The US, Germany, and England's Film Industries Join Hands <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>

<p>丨 Fox, Ufa, and Gaumont</p>
<p>American Fox Film Corporation and German Ufa Film Company have now reached a similar point. The two parties will officially collaborate on productions. The significance of this collaboration is that it is neither Ufa merging with Fox, nor Fox merging with Ufa. It is simply a collaboration on production work, art, and star exchanges. At the same time, Ufa and Fox have also established a relationship with Gaumont British Film Company in London, England. Therefore, Gaumont may also be involved.</p>
<p>The collaboration between Fox and Gaumont also required much effort. Some time ago, American Paramount first entered into cooperation negotiations with the Gaumont authorities. After months of discussions, they finally broke down. After Paramount cancelled the previous agreement, Fox seized the opportunity and easily resolved the issue.</p>
<p>Fox and Ufa are keeping absolute secrecy regarding their collaboration on their works and are still unwilling to announce it publicly. Ufa's representative, Erich Pommer, travels between Europe and America, and rarely tells people about it. In addition to Mr. Pommer, Andre Davin, the production manager traveling between Paris, was also involved in this negotiation. It is also rumored that the productions of the Fox-Ufa collaboration will be filmed in Paris. In addition, Bilian Harvey's recent joining of Fox is a precursor to Ufa's satisfaction with Fox.</p>
<p>This matter was initiated entirely by Ufa. Over the years, they have consulted with various American companies on a way to obtain economic assistance from the American side. Because Ufa felt that it would be better to shoot American versions (note: each country's film shoots versions in foreign languages abroad) than to shoot British versions. The collaboration between Ufa and Gaumont has given them great experience after being screened in the United States. If they cooperate with the United States and use their talent and equipment at the Berlin film studio, it will not be difficult to produce excellent works. With excellent results, it will not be difficult to occupy a</p>
<p>Significant influence in the American market. At first, Ufa wanted to hire American screenwriters and several American stars to go to Germany. This method would of course be welcomed by the United States. However, Ufa's board of directors rejected this plan, believing that the cost was too high. From Fox's perspective, cooperating with Ufa is also extremely cost-effective in terms of economics. Because if Fox did not cooperate, they would have to shoot versions in Germany and compete with Ufa (as all companies do), otherwise they would have to abandon this market. Now that they cooperate with each other, the cost is low and the effectiveness is better. And it can first communicate with various technologies of the German film studio.</p>

<p>Pippa Del Nile said: "The happiest day of my life was the day I married my lover. My lover is so lovely, he is so great and tall, so..." Do you know what I mean?</p>
<p>Little Sister Liming Hui said: "This is really outrageous. Foreign films can allow them to have kissing scenes, but Chinese films don't allow it. If it were allowed, I would have had at least five opportunities to kiss in Qiu Qixiang's "The Pursuit"."</p>

<p>Karloff's fate, however, Lang Chuck died due to overwork. However, in the past year, Hollywood has discovered a silver star with the same style as Lang Chuck, namely Boris Karloff. He rose to fame after starring in "Frankenstein," but we should know that whenever Karloff plays this character with a strangely beautiful shape that Lang Chuck often played, he must have great patience to resist the pain of forced contortion on the body for a long period of time. When Karloff recently starred in "The Mummy," he worked with long strips of cloth tightly wrapped around him for as long as an hour each time.</p>
<p>Karloff's close friends often advised Karloff to try to do less strenuous work when performing, but he remained silent about it, just like Lang Chuck. He thought that if he could play the role appropriately, he would not feel any pain in his own body. However, in the near future, I am afraid that his muscles will finally be unable to withstand this forced contortion. By then, the film industry will inevitably add another victim.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Do You Know? <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>

<p>Do you know? Chinese film emperor Jin Yan (although he himself does not admit to being the Chinese film emperor). From December 25th of last year to January 10th of this year, he received a total of 745 Christmas and New Year's cards, of which 562 were sent to him by women. Among these women, according to himself, he doesn't know 98 percent of them at all, but there are also many who were his former classmates, but he can't remember them now. In the 186 Christmas and New Year's cards from men, the opposite is true. He only doesn't know more than ten of them at all, but there are also many who are friends he usually exchanges a few letters with but has never met, accounting for one-fifth. (Retribution)</p>
<h3 id="e226">The Future Von Sternberg and Dietrich <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Hua</p>
<p>Director Von Sternberg, after arguing with Marlene Dietrich, is now said to be preparing to go to the West Indies before deciding on his whereabouts. The previous rumor of going to Japan is inaccurate. As for Dietrich, after her contract with Paramount expires in February of this year, she will continue to star in a film, probably titled "Song of Songs," directed by Robin Mammerlin. (This information is slightly different from what Mr. Cun transmitted on the 20th.)</p>

<p>— Yi Hua</p>
<p>We certainly already knew that Janet Gaynor often partnered with Qili Falei, but now she has collaborated with Liu Yalis, the lead actor of "National Law is Hard to Tolerate," in "State Fair."</p>
<p>When Ms. Gaynor was filming "Tess of the Storm Country" (still co-starring with Qili Falei), Fox Film Corporation had already intended to invite Liu Yalis to join, but it was later cancelled due to other matters. This is the last collaboration between the film emperor and the film queen.</p>

<p>"Now that you have entered the film industry, every morning, the gatekeeper of the film studio smiles and opens the door for you. Then you should remember the following golden rules:</p>
<p>"Live in a Spanish-style house on Beverly Hills, but still tell others that it is far less comfortable than living in a plank house in your hometown."</p>
<p>"Try to get married and hold a grand and solemn wedding."</p>
<p>"Try to get divorced, but you must firmly declare that you and your ex-husband are still 'close friends'."</p>
<p>"Uphold the spirit of democracy and casually talk to the electrical workers, prop workers, and all the people in charge in the film studio at any time."</p>
<p>"Be especially intimate with visitors, ask them to keep the conversation a secret: do not publish it in the newspaper, although the news they get has already been known to others, you still have to make them feel that this is an unpublished secret conversation."</p>
<p>"For the relationship with relatives and old friends, you must make people see that you 'remember the old days' and that you have not forgotten poverty and humbleness."</p>
<p>"In addition, there are many things that should or should not be done, but if you follow the above, it will be enough for you to ask for whatever you want and eat endlessly!"</p>

<p>— Translated by Xi Meng</p>
<p>Eric, with a face haggard and on the verge of death from worry, saw Paul and asked in surprise:</p>
<p>"Where did you go? I was almost going crazy."</p>
<p>"I told you, don't worry," Paul said calmly. "I'll take care of everything."</p>
<p>"But where are we going to find 40 million in cash?"</p>
<p>Paul shrugged his shoulders and said unhurriedly:</p>
<p>"I'll take these Italian treasury bonds to Wall Street in New York, are you afraid I can't sell them for money?"</p>
<p>"Italian treasury bonds...Italian treasury bonds?" Eric said in surprise. "Didn't you already sell them long ago?"</p>
<p>"Eric," Paul said to him calmly, "You still don't know about me. What you know is really very little. When I come back from New York, I will tell you in detail. You don't need to worry now... Now I ask you to send a telegram to Muerena, telling her to meet me in New York next Monday. Tell her that I must meet her."</p>
<p>Eric sighed a sigh of relief and said admiringly:</p>
<p>"Paul, you are really unpredictable." After he finished speaking, his heart added even more admiration.</p>
<p>Paul smiled, took out a photo of Muerena from the drawer, looked at it for a while, and closed his eyes. He held the photo of Muerena against his chest. Inside his chest were the already dead Scallatti's treasury bonds, which she had completely forgotten.</p>
<p>He arrived in New York and hurried to the hotel to meet Muerena. While he was at sea, he had already communicated with her once by radio, saying that she could only stay in New York for one day. So when he arrived at the hotel, he had been waiting for a long time.</p>
<p>"Mattie!" He said one word in a hoarse voice, and couldn't continue. His eyes were full of adoration. She was even more beautiful than before. He looked at her and his heart was jumping uncontrollably. He hurriedly walked over.</p>
<p>But he was not allowed to get close to her, and was rejected.</p>
<p>Paul was too happy, so he didn't notice that Muerena's attitude had changed.</p>
<p>"Mattie!" he said softly. "Only now can I finally get what I want. I have borrowed a large sum of money, so that I can get rid of all the chores from now on and spend all day with you, never to be separated. I have planned everything. You don't need to film movies anymore.</p>
<p>Mattie, I want to marry you as my wife." As he said this, he wanted to hug her, but she opened up again.</p>
