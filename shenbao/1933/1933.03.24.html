<p>憲草會討論</p>
<h3>國民大會職權</h3>
<p>今日三四兩組開聨席會議</p>
<p>（南京）　立法院憲法草案委員會二十三日開第七次會、出席委員長孫科、副委員長張知本·吳經熊、委員焦易堂·馬超俊·等三十一人、討論國民大會之組織及職權等問題、惟以本問題與第四組中央政府制度問題有相連關係、討論結果、各委主張三四兩組召開聨席會議、决於二十四日開會、據某委員談、國民大會在各國憲法中無此先例、總理於建國大綱中、雖有規定、但未可作爲憲法條文、且國民大會爲由訓政入憲政時期之唯一會議機關、其性質殊爲重人、須經縝密研究、計、本日憲草會討論、多集中於國民大會職權問題、有主張除直接四權外、尙須規定宣戰媾和及修改解釋憲法之權、但國民大會組織頗形龐大、如職與職權太大、則各地代表來京一次、亦屬不易、經過二三月地代表來京主次、亦屬不易、經過二三月之集會期間、若因宣戰講和等又須召集會議、恐事實上頗多窒礙、故又有主張職權應加以限制者、又於國民大會閉幕後、是否設立經常負責機關、亦未决定、則職權之詳細規定、似較困難、至憲示中僅規定國民大會之大體、其餘詳細章則、尙須另制單行法規云、（二十三日中央社電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>對日抗爭與口岸封鎖乃·</h3>
<p>日帝國主義在籌謀退出國聨之際。忽以負責者談話之方式。發表關於所謂封鎖問題之意見。其言曰。世界各國。决不因日本退出國聨而封鎖日本。如誠加日本以封鎖。日本海軍。可立即封鎖中國口岸。杜絶各國之對華通商。同時日本可以强制貿易。維持非常時之經濟云云。國聨之無能。吾人已一再言之。其所謂經濟制裁。吾人亦曾斷定其徒爲欺人之具。因列强决不肯因中國問題犧牲其對日之貿易也。故其所謂世界各國决不因日本退出國聨而封鎖日本一語。對於國聨之弱點。可謂洞見肺腑。而返觀我國之持妥洽主義者。日猶以求神問卜之方式。找求外交之出路。亦可謂愚蠢無識者矣。</p>
<p>其次。則日海軍如欲封鎖我國口岸。除兩廣外。亦爲輕而易舉之一著。自琉球臺灣淪入敵手。日帝國主義之於中國。在地理上已造成一半圓形之包圍陣線。國人如有暇一閱亞洲地圖。當知其言之不謬。在此種天然的形勢之下。日人祗須以潛水艇之活動。已儘足施行有效的包圍。此種包圍。北起冀魯。南迄閩浙。僅珠江流域。則以英人勢力之所在。或可以託庇而幸免耳。我國二十餘年來無識軍人。酣於南戰。所謂國防。久已置之度外。一旦事變猝起。始知其已成甕中之鼈。誰實爲之。能毋痛心。</p>
<p>其三。則所謂强制貿易云者。一二八之役。已開其端。平津膠濟一帶。更已視爲故常。爾時地方上懦弱之官吏。懾於日人砲艦之威嚇。自行禁止人民之反日。無恥奸商。更將因蠅頭之微利。以日貨刮取人民之汗血。以關内貿易之所得。移作完成關内侵略之所需。原屬已然之事實。則所謂維持非常時之經濟者。固早已雛形畢具也。如認强制貿易爲强逼買賣。則大誤矣。</p>
<p>由上之說。則中國之對日抗爭。必須爲一反帝的民族革命。已屬顯然。倘中國而不能以壯士斷腕之勇氣。放棄事實上原爲帝國主義經濟侵略大本營之口岸。犧牲帝國主義資本勢力控制下之幼稚的民族資本。固决不敢以言戰。而在此財政命脈繫於貿易金融勢力集中口岸之際。非準備對於財政政策及貨幣制度作非常之改革。亦决不足以言戰。必有如是之决心。如是之毅力。乃能自動加口岸以反封鎖。使廣大之内地。不再爲帝國主義勢力下各通商口岸之消費市場。然後乃能破日人以華制華之毒計。乃能使列强間之利害衝突。因中國市場之杜絶而瞬趨銳化。雖然。此又豈能希冀於苟且偸安沉淫忘返之國入哉。</p>
<h3>德不忘海外舊屬地</h3>
<p>日本不放棄委治諸島</p>
<p>引起德政府極端重視</p>
<p>（柏林）　退還德國海外屬地問題、現已成爲德國對外政策之重要部份、國家社會黨政府對於日本之宣言、謂即使日本退出國聨、亦不能退還以前受委託管理之太平洋諸島、極加重視、今日官方傳稱、此問題唯有國聨行政院及委託管理委員會能解决之、若國聨行政院及委託管理委員會能辦理此事、則德國政府將以保全德國屬地全部之利益爲立塲云、（廿二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）　日外部接到駐德使館報告云、备政府昨發聲明書謂、南洋羣島委任統治問題、須在國聨行政會與委任統治委員會解决、德政府决定在此兩機關主張其要求、不對日本單獨有所表示、日政府雖退出國聨、委任統治委員會仍决定參加、故在退出國聨後、將與國聨各國發生更嚴重衝突、日外部對此聲明、認爲重要問題、將加以愼重研究對付辦法云、（廿三日華聨電）</p>
<p>（東京）　德政府關於南洋委任統治問題、曾正式聲明發表其態度、日海軍當局對之非常緊張、現待駐德日武官之公報、南洋委任統治、爲日本之海上生命線、今日海軍軍事普及部發行之「退出國聨與南洋委任統治」載有如下之見解、（一）南洋諸島於參加大戰後、爲日本海軍所佔領、大戰中已於日本與英國之接洽中、允於大戰終了後爲日本之領士、（一）然美國因參戰之結果、於講和會議獲得發言權、對合併德國之殖民地、主張反對、因此日英法意四國捨名取實、於代國聨統治之名義下、分歸日本（一）然此分歸、係在國聨成立前所决定、而南洋諸島乃非國聨所委任、故國聨無變更委任統治國之權、（一）要之、所謂國聨之委任統治、其主權非在國聨而在日本、故即使退出、更無放棄之必要也、（二十三日電通電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　現料倘日本於正式通知退出國聨後、仍聲明欲保留太平洋代管諸島、　協約國恐將召集會議討論此事最近日本與德國對　島處置問題之聲明、已令此間大爲惶慮、咸料立將成爲棘手之危局、且聞華盛頓方面業已通知國聨、倘日本脫離國聨後仍圖保留諸島、美國將極爲關切、　因法律專家同謂舊德殖民地在名義上仍屬協約國所有、國聨僅以保管員資格代爲處置耳、（二十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）日本因將退出國聨、而願繼續保持太平洋上諸統治島一節、現在國聨方面已成爲一討論之大問題、此諸島歐戰前屬諸德國、故國聨與德國俱對於此問題感覺極尖銳之興趣、并俱覺此事不能由日本一方面專擅解决之、而必須由各國會同以國際間條約處理之、蓋國聨統治城管理方法之原則、必因之而受影響也、故將來此問題提出討論之時、德國亦必能得有機會陳述其意見也、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　今日此間可靠方面傳出、俟日本正式通知退出國聨後、德政府即將於國聨委治統治委員會開會討論太平洋日本代管島嶼問題時、要求歸還德國、惟據接近希特勒政府者言、德國不欲乞助於國聨、寗願國聨自行發動、目下德國全國對此諸島之運命、非常熱切注意、今日哥恩日報社論聲稱、日本政府宣言仍欲保留太平洋代管諸島、已發生一極端嚴重問題、此事有關原則、故與德國有重要關係、此乃關於代管制度之基本問題、屬於國聨管轄範圍、不能專就日本一方面着想云、（二十三日國民電）</p>

<p>内閣更迭不出七月</p>
<p>敦勸藏相勉維現狀</p>
<p>各政黨積極策動</p>
<p>國民同盟倡平沼内閣</p>
<p>民政黨擁立宇坦一成</p>
<p>錦旗會要求皇親執政</p>
<p>（東京）　日議會闭幕期祇餘兩天、政界視聽移在繼任内閣問題、齋藤首相今晨十一時在院内再與山本内相會商結果、對下台問題意見已一致、只候國會結束後尋機下台、至於繼任内閣問題、各派主張異常紛歧、政友會主張以鈴木總裁組織政黨强有力内閣、不妨與友黨合作、民政黨則倡齋藤改造内閣、繼續執政、否則移交宇垣韓督、組織以民政黨爲基本之軍人内閣、國民同盟主張成立平沼内閣、與軍部切實合作、最堪注意者爲法西斯黨徒之主張皇親内閣、實行「錦旗革命」、藉皇室威嚴、圖塞反對派之口、凡反對主張者、槪以叛逆論罪、計劃以絶異端論者、按錦旗會於一九三一年九一八事變後、十月中曾擁護某皇親欲行錦旗革命、因事前遭受失敗、此次又乘機活動、以靑年軍人做背景、表面上即以無政府主義者遠藤無水主持、日政局前途如何、當此新内閣未成立以前、確有一番之熱鬧云、（二十三日華聨電）</p>
<p>（東京）　因齋藤首相與高橋藏相之會見、現内閣確將於適當時期掛冠、大約在議會終了後、預算施行手續完畢、熱河問題之善後、與退出國聨之手續告一段落之際、即行下野、爲期必在七月、昨與藏相會見時、首相曾陳述希望、請於七月以前暫時自重、藏相似已諒解、（二十三日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）　齋藤首相本日與閣内之長老山本内相會談二十分鐘、首相說明政局及其他問題、並關於内閣之進退問題、詢問内相意見、内相因現在時局嚴重、切勿輕舉、進退問題與各閣員取同一行動、齋藤首相擬於日内訪問西園寺、傳達内相意見、請求諒解、（二十三日日聨電）</p>
<p>（東京）　此間日政界觀察、元老重臣對齋藤内閣前途、殊抱消極態度、其理由大略如次、（一）齋藤登台以來、對非常時局救濟工作、確有相當功績、但其設施缺乏一貫方策、（二）財政經濟政策、並無遠大計劃、惟彌補目前需要而已、將來實堪憂慮、（三）内田外長僅對歐美各國申述日本之立塲耳、毫無建設經綸、處此遠東風雲日益緊張之今日、應有相當外交技術之發揮、始能救出目前孤立之境地、今後應積極進行建設外交、挽救日本之危局、由上列理由、元老重臣方面對齋藤下台問題題、恐不加任何慰留、然此種觀察、不過盛傳於政友會與軍部方面、其他態度尙未鮮明、（二十三日華聨電）</p>

<h3>介紹幾位日本的海軍巨頭</h3>
<p>前任海軍大臣岡田啓介就是福井海軍的領袖、他在一月六日忽然表示辭意、結果、推舉大角岑生繼任、大角氏以前也做過齋籐任海相時代的高級副官、田中内閣時也在岡田海相之下做過次官、他本是政友會、在齋籐内閣對政友會方面、如果把大角氏來代替岡田氏、黨然是適宜的、</p>
<p>岡田辭職之後、非常時期的日本海軍將領、除了元帥府的東鄉和現任軍令部長的伏見宫博恭王之外、同在福井海軍的加簝寬治爲最前輩、而安保清種·谷口尙眞·山本英輔·及大角等次之、</p>
<p>在霞關（地名）高聳蒼天的建築物、就是掌握海軍行政和用兵作戰的海軍省和軍令部的集合地帶、其中有士官八千二百人、兵士八萬八千人、艦隊二百八十餘艘、和航空飛機八百架、現在舉出幾位人物來介紹一下、</p>
<p>在被擬爲海軍領袖的人物中、首先應該注意的、就是在中日·日俄兩次戰役時、志願入兵學校的一班學生中、包括了日本最多數的海軍人物、</p>
<p>這一班的人物、就是明治十一年兵學校第一期畢業者、而尤以海軍將校第二十一期與第二十二期爲中心的、</p>
<p>當朝鮮東學黨事變時、日本於明治二十七年八月一日對吾國宣戰、隔兩月而入兵學校的就是第二十一期的現任海相大角氏、再經兩個月、即山复勝之進所肄業的第二十二期又募集了、</p>
<p>在大角氏一期中、成績最優秀者、就是升至少將就辭職的筑士次郎氏、第二名是軍事參議官山本英輔、第三名纔是大角氏、所以今後最有海相希望的應該是山本了、除了東鄉之外、山本就是薩州海軍的首領、其父就是山本權的兄弟、</p>
<p>他的叔父山本伯氏、長時期握着過去海軍的最高權威、其女婿財部氏也長期執着海軍的牛耳、但是他之所以能達到今日的地位、完全是靠他自己的能力、並没有受過山本伯的餘澤、傳說齋藤内閣的前途、到了五月就會壽終正寢、新聞界方面、都推戴山梨·小林·爲次任的海相、在今日的狀態之下、他是被舉爲軍令部長的候補者、再其次的海相、應該要算他最有出馬的可能性了、</p>
<p>其次、海軍大臣的候補者、就是軍事參議官山梨氏、山梨在倫敦會議時、任海軍次官、與軍令部的加藤·末次·的積極派相對立、頗有政治手腕、他出生在仙台、</p>
<p>除了山本·山梨·二人之外、尙有獨張龍的横鎭長官野村吉三郎、（即上海事變後爲韓國志士所炸傷者）和第一艦隊長官小林躋造、這二人在今年四月都要升任爲大將了、</p>
<p>野村氏和小林氏不同、前者是没有進過海軍的、但是這兩人都被目爲眼前非常時代的海軍能手、並且都是逝世的加藤友三郎的信任人物、野村氏任了加藤氏的高級副官、在華盛頓會議時、也做了加藤的隨員、兩人常是形影相倚的、一方面小林又是加藤的外甥、所以他們當然有繼任大臣或部長可能性、這兩人很奇怪的、在四五年以前所就的官職都是相同、而且都保持着互相對抗的地位、但是野村氏却失掉一隻眼睛、使他將來的官運、多少總有一些影響、較之小林的官運、終不免稍有遜色、</p>
<p>其次、應該提到的就是中村良三、中村氏以第一名考入兵學校、而以第一名畢業、的確是個軍令部長候補者、但是和他同期畢業的末次氏是全海軍的新領袖、並且也是軍令部長候補人物、這是中村氏的可怕的對手、</p>
<p>與倫敦會議同時、突然聞名的末次氏、對於次期的軍令部長、確有繼任的可能性、他所以一躍而獲得全國的聲價者、就是當軍令次長在倫敦會議中飛躍的緣故、當時軍令部的活動、部長加藤氏不過是一種裝飾品、其實可以說都是末次氏所幹的勾當、在今年四月末次氏或許可以和中村同時升做大將、也未可知、</p>
<p>在末次氏之次的領袖人物、就是第二十五期的永野修身氏和佐鎭長官左近司政三氏、</p>
<p>永野生於土佐、將來有任大臣或部長的可能性、並且是不亞於小林·末次·中村·三人、他在美國長任駐在武官之職、是個美國通、他雖　任大臣的可能、但是軍令部長是比較適合的、</p>
<p>左近司原籍在米澤、生父是住在大阪的律師、所以他是個純粹的大阪的小孩、他任水雷戰隊司令官時代、曾大駡軍令部中央的戰術、所以永野與左近司之自負、在不久的將來、或爲日本海軍的重要角色、</p>

<h3>抗日應用全綫進擊計畫</h3>
<p>并談潛伏義軍盼援發動</p>
<p>昨偕吳煥章往謁吳市長</p>
<p>黑龍江黨務指導委員黑省民衆自衛軍副司令于明洲、曁樸炳珊·鄧文·之代表李銘新、相繼來滬、向本市各團體接洽援助、于氏昨於旅邸、與新聲社記者談話如左</p>
<h3>因我局部抵抗</h3>
<p>日軍利用雄厚之新式武器、肆行侵略、然士兵之作戰能力、極爲薄弱、不足一擊、如嫩江之役、淞滬之役、及最近喜峯口之役、我軍均與以重創、然日人利用各個擊破之策略、而我國復陷於局部抵抗之錯誤、致淞滬及吉黑兩省、先後敗績、而榆關之失、與侵入熱河、日人復得從容進兵、爲所欲爲、毫無顧忌、今復兵臨長城、我人懲前毖後、决不能以抵抗爲已足、</p>
<h3>被日各個擊破</h3>
<p>日軍近日侵熱之部隊、大部均係自吉黑兩省調來如鈴木等三旅團、均在黑龍江與我軍作戰、而在黑作戰之部隊、在俘獲敵軍身上檢出之紀錄觀之、則知大部均曾參加淞滬作戰者、統計侵佔東北四省之日軍、不足　萬人、較諸我軍人數、相差甚鉅、然因局部抵抗之結果、南則侵擾淞滬、停戰之後、又調至東北、先後擊敗樸炳珊·蘇炳文·馬占山·王德林·馮占海·李杜·各部、復傾師侵熱、在吉黑義軍、因交通阻塞、不能聨絡、一致動作、爲其各個擊破、今作戰地點、巳至長城、而中央各軍之設備、亦遠非崛起民間者可比、倘仍局部抵抗、在敵人擊破之處應戰、則其前途實屬可危、應速籌全線進擊之計劃、使日軍不能應付、始足恢復失地、</p>

<h3>國民應如何救中國</h3>
<p>昨晚七時、吳市長敎育局所約定之中西藥房無線電台、作播音演講、題爲「國民應如何救中國、」茲錄其演詞如下、</p>
<p>諸君、當此民族生命萬分危險、大好河山日蹙千里、日本軍隊侵我邊境的時候、我全國民衆、在奔走駭惶、激昂慷慨、悲憤憂傷之餘、亦曾靜觀默察、一思此空前無比的國難、造因何在乎、亦曾一思將何以奮發自强、以避免將來莫大的恐怖、渡過空前未有的難關乎、亦曾一思如何雪恥圖强、如何負起救亡禦侮的責任、恢復民族固有光榮的歷史乎、從整個世界的情勢、中國目前的局面、以及人類爭存的原則來講、我們此刻、自然祇有「積極抵抗、」始能打開民族的出路、而且也唯有和衷共濟、集中國力、一致救國、纔能挽救這空前未有的厄運、開展我民族復興的新機、然而我國本爲歷史上優秀的文化民族、論人口、論領土、論氣候、論物産、以及一切構成國家的原素、都在他國之上、爲什麽會受人侵略、受人蹂躪呢、我們在抵抗奮鬥的時候、如果對於這一點、不先深思而考慮、不究他國所以强盛的道理、反省我國所以衰落的原因、自亦不能確立救國大計、昭示奮鬥的途徑、如果大家祗知盲目的救國、浮囂的奮鬥、而救之不以其道、奮鬥不得其力、則抵抗奮鬥的結果、亦必無傷於强敵約得一八零六年、當德國被拿破崙戰敗以後、有一位愛國的哲學家斐希德Fichte、對他們的國民演講、說「我們現在已經被征服了、但是我們是否再要受敵人的恥辱、是否永遠不能恢復民族的光榮、這全靠我們的自决、全靠我們的努力、「大家要知道、德國的失敗、並非一二人之咎、而是全國人民共同的過失、是我們全國人民的愚昧·昏横·幼稚·懦怯·種種病態所釀成的結果、武力的戰爭、現已過去了、今後的　戰爭、是智識的戰爭、道德的戰爭、品性的戰爭、我們是否能參加這種戰爭、也要看我們國民有没有决心、」我所希望於聽講諸君的、不要苟安、不要因循、不要消極、不要徒事悲憤、應當進爲澈底的思索、設法以自拔於苦痛、「我們所以有性命的價值、因爲有我們民族永續的生命、民族若亡、我們雖生猶死、民族若存、我們雖死猶生、所以我們應該爲民族的生命、而犧牲、而奮鬥、」中國今天的局勢、正同德國當時一樣、而斐希德氏對德國民衆的演講、也等於對我們國民的演講一樣、很值得我們國民的參考和猛省、然而德國民族、已因斐希德演講的感化而雪恥自强了、我們中國民衆、却受了一百年列强的侵略與壓迫、尙不能覺悟、不能自强、這不能不說是我們民族精神上最大的弱點與危機、現在一般國民、都已知道「國難」這個名詞、然而眞正能明日國難的意義、國難的原因者、到底有幾人呢、眞能脚蹈實地、挽救國難的、又到底有幾人呢、大家要知道、「憂患足以　邦、」敵國外患、並不是國難、武力侵略、也不足以亡國、惟有民族自已的墮落、實爲一個最大的危機、亦是民族召亡的原因、假使舉國民氣、團結向上、舉國民志、努力奮發、則國基自然能鞏固、民族自然發展、現在中國最大的危險、就在一般民衆、尙不知國的　眞意、不知國難的原因、而一般領導民衆奔走救國的、也祗會作形式上的激昂、而不能作實際上的努力、所以近百年來、雖每次國難之後、都有救國運動、然每次救國運動、終不能救得中國、我們覺悟的民衆、應該痛定思痛、從今以後、澈底認識國難之意義、反省國難的原因、須知國難之來、初非一朝一夕之故、亦非一兩個人之咎、而是全國人民共同的過失、是全國人民平、時愚昧昏憒幼稚懦怯萎靡自私因循怠惰種種積弊所釀成的惡果繼此以往、我們應該深自痛責、努力自新、脚踏實地、永下堅苦勇毅奮鬥救國的决心、從文化上、經濟上、各人本分的職務上、以及平時生活的方式上、刻苦自勵、切實努力、以充實民族生命内容、鞏固國家發展之基礎、我們努力了一分、就是國家救得了一分、而全國人民分頭努力的總和、也就是民族雪恥圖强最後的成功、古人說、「十年生聚、十年敎訓」雪恥圖强、本來不可期諸旦夕、必待長期與切實的努力、始能見效、希望全國民衆、遵守這一條救國的鐵律、認清當前國難癥結之所在、决定長期奮鬥方針、切實努力、以應付這空前劇烈的世變、而恢復我們偉大的文化的中華民族固有光榮燦爛的歷史、如果當此危亟存亡最後的關頭、一誤再誤、不能打開生路、掙扎圖存、則亡國的悲劇、滅種的慘禍、恐就在最近的將來了、</p>

<h3>工部局候選議董政見</h3>
<p>紀錄法院缺點</p>
<p>遏止排貨</p>
<p>反對增加華董</p>
<p>檢查工廠</p>
<p>公共租界工部局議董英籍候選人裴爾等七人、昨在本埠各西報發表其政見如下、</p>
<p>裴爾　曰、余如再獲選仍擬循舊日之政策、竭力維持公共租界之權利與自由、並與附近區域之當局合作、以求共同福利、尤其對於界外所築之道路、擬覓求一滿意之協定、余主張嚴格之減政、但對於用以維持租界安寗與聲望之經費、亦不少吝、</p>
<p>白朗　曰、余如獲選、擬贊助趨向市政至大合作之政策、俾依至廣大之解釋維持租界之利益、</p>
<p>亞諾爾德　曰、余如再獲選、擬　行上年工部局施行政策、再公共租界之權利、不容侵蝕、今工部局有兩大問題、應加注意、（一）嚴密審查各項費用、因照現在之用度、不久又須增加捐率、或募巨債、（二）與上海市政府完成界外築路協定、目下公用公司如電力公司自來水公司電話公司在此協定未成以前、均不能與新用戶接洽、界外道路問題、延久不决、實爲締結此種合同之主要阻力也、</p>
<p>麥賽　曰、余如再獲選、擬盡力調解地主與自來水公司間發生之不幸事端、維持防軍與警政之實力、就財力之所許、增進有益衛生與一般發展之事業、余尤將注重改善地方法院之行政、</p>
<p>海里斯　曰、余信今最要者、爲外國租界之完整與安全應加維持、上海與四周區域之和平安寗·繁榮應首先顧及、當吾人現爲此種擾攘之狀態包圍時、對於擁護吾人之條約權利、無論如何、不能稍示軟弱、地方法院協定、現復展長三年此問題本年不致提及考慮、但工部局應審愼注意該法院之行政、對於各案判决與執行、有失宜之處、應一一紀錄、俾他日修正協定時、得提出該法院目下組織與辦公缺點之證據、而要求成立一種可保大衆咸享公道之司法制、今日最重要待决之諸問題、其一爲界外道路之地位、余信旣須保有實效的警務管理之要點、而儘可與中國當局訂立一種協定、而准作合法必要之擴張、並容現居或　居於推廣區域者安然居住、而受生活上所必要之各項公用事務之便利、至於關於上海將來地位之重要問題、不久似將由列强考慮及之、余以爲上海各國僑民應聨合組織一外僑公會、俾可成彼等發表意見之機關、凡涉及上海利益之各事、將來討論時、槪應商諸上海工部局與法公董局、而容其有相當之代表、此節至關重要、工部局第一責任、乃在注重居民最佳之利益、以治理租界、維持和平與秩序、遏止非法活動與排貨、如工部局辦事權力有所不足、則應利用各種　會、而使此權力適當充分、余於已往二十五年内、曾於財政與經濟作特别之研究、故信吾人當鑒於世界各城、今所受經濟衰落之影響、而早籌可能的方法、以防此種風潮波及上海云云、</p>
<p>麥克那登　曰、余若獲選、當竭棉薄、保持租界行政完整之美譽、關於工部局之政策、與政費之支配上、首當顧及市民之安全與衛生、在安全方面、余永不吝惜維持警政救火及商團效能之費用、上海在表面上、雖暫時安寗、但己往歷史謂我紛擾之來、常若颶風之迅至、事先罕有警告、故必須時時有應付緊急狀態之準備、在衛生方面、余亦永不吝惜購置曠斱與公共工程之經費、並信將來召集納稅人特别會議討論修改附律、限令工廠領照問題時、必能有充分人數到會、滿足法定額數也、余深信上海前途無量、認交通問題、亦極重要、余之交通政策、主張三事、卽發展本市與外邑之運輸用具、趕速解决越界築路問題、擴張現有公用事業公司之活動範圍、對於租界以外逐漸興盛地方、供給公用事業之便利云、</p>
<p>賴墨　曰、余對市政之方針與見解、大略如下、當中國繼續在此擾攘不定之秋、應力保洋涇浜　章程所允租界内納稅西人之權利在各國董事名額不增之時、反對再增華董名額、吾輩當圖早日解决越界築路問題、又當恃全部警力、輔以對於義勇服務與特别巡捕之奬勵、盡力擔保租界之和平與安全、因駐滬各國軍隊、常有撤回之可能性故也、惟巡捕職務、旣極重要而危險、必不可令有缺額、又認工部局管理工廠之時機已至、應予工部局發給執照與檢查工廠之權、關於敎育、租界内華人問題、因工部局經濟有限、最當審愼考慮、認爲敎育經費、宜限定占租界總收入之若干成、又關於辦理有利公衆工作各機關之補助金、亦應予以同情考慮、余固知前述種種、倘予實行、勢須增加開支、但此日之金錢、苟能用得其道、歷時久遠之後、或反可證明爲經濟之舉也、縱目下生活程度日高、苟略事增加捐稅、亦未必有甚可反對處、此外洋涇浜章程中選舉辦法亦宜加以修改云、</p>

<h3>農村破産與失業問題</h3>
<p>丨漣水汪泰霞君訊丨</p>
<p>我將成爲餓莩了，懇求先生指我一條光明的出路。我現在述一述我的身事；我是一個人力車夫，我家裏有三個入，一個殘廢的父親，一個五十多歲的老母，和一個我。我家裏有三畝多田，平時由我母親一個人種；我在拉車餘時，也帮同伊老人家工作。近年來是閙着水荒，這三畝多田。等於没有的一樣。我拉車一天所得，在以先總有一元多錢的收入；現今是不同了，因爲拉車的人一天總是多一天。已分去了我生意不少。現在一天連幾角錢都找不到；至今已是負債纍纍了。現在可是又糟了，我鄉又辦了兩部汽車；平時我們所專以爲生意的拉車路線，至今已爲它永遠的奪去了。因爲它載一個人行五六十里路，只要五角多錢，而且又快，一天總要開三四個來回。我們人力車的生意，直接是没有了，因爲我們載一個人行五六十里路，起碼要一塊錢。一天，只得做一筆生意，加上現在買賣又不好，幾天還靠不住找到一筆生意。我家的生活，已是到達艱難的極點了，一天三個人連兩頓粥都吃不了。這樣還不是我一家子呢，大凡拉車爲生的人家，恐怕都是和我家一樣吧，看丨他們那個汽車站上，天天洋錢如水一樣的多，是多麽的快活呵？，我現在車子是拉不成了，我不得不到人家去做長工；於是我又找了兩個親友。爲我找帮人家做長工的事情，過了幾日後，我的親友來了，他這樣的回復了我：現在鄉間人家没有要用長工的，大戶人家的下人己是滿滿的了，丨因爲近來爲水荒没田種的人，現在都到人家做長工的去了。小戶人家那裏又要人呢。光明的能者先生呵？我們就這樣的餓死了嗎？現在我們也差不多就要餓死了。我連一個機關的跑腿都找不到，因爲全是滿滿的，說不定還有人在等着呢！唉！我將到何處去？我到那裏去爲誰工做？我將用什麽方法來養活我這兩個年高的父母？見識深廣的記者先生，請你爲我想一個圓滿的方法呢！</p>
<p>答：你的來信眞值得我們贊頌，因爲你所述的事實表現出現社會之眞實的現象，就是一幅資本主義侵入鄉村，鄉村的迅速破産，農民大批失業，不但農民失業，並且是城市亦不能容納鄉村大量的失業人口，因而又成爲工人的失業等等的畫圖。這種現象當然是普遍的，不是足下一人的問題。而是中國普遍的農村問題。要想解决足下個人問題必要從解决整個問題着手。依我們看來，救濟這種恐慌現象，至少要有下列幾種辦法：（一）迅速地站在最大多數的農民利益方面，以眞正的民主主義的觀點，解决鄉村的土地問題。（二）大家没田種的，或有田而被災荒所侵襲無以爲生的，或失業的鄉村工人，大家應有一種組織，聚集起來研究這種問題。（三）有了這種組織便可進而研究鄉村中水旱災荒之物理上的各種原因，如森林之如何培植，農業之如何改進，到了這時，大家便會覺悟，所謂水旱災荒，不僅是出於天然，實則一半都因畸形的與不平等的社會制度的結果。所以要救濟鄉村中的恐慌，必須先解决農民的土地問題；要解决土地問題，又必須農民先有了自身的組織；有了組織自然會感覺着社會制度與農民有密切的關係。那時你們自然會看見前面的出路。我們這種答覆，你自然要詫異道，所答非所問。然而我們除了這種答覆之外，又想不出像「千手千眼的觀音大士」那樣「救苦救難」的辦法</p>

<p>二十一·江西省敎育經費、全年二百餘萬元、用於小學及留學津貼者似嫌過多、用於社會敎育者過少、應按照需要、重加支配、以求平均發展、同時地力敎育經費、爲數僅八十餘萬、不敷甚鉅</p>

<h3>六君子</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>丨丨大家多此一舉丨丨</p>
<p>英籍的六君子，搗蘇俄的蛋，蘇俄要治以反革命罪，鐵面無私，一槍一個。這可急傷了英國，急急忙忙，提出抗議。當然囉，英國的抗議，比中國「責任由貴國負之」的調調兒，要神氣活現到一百二十四倍。豈知撞了蘇俄一下橡皮釘子，碰了一鼻子灰，抗議不生效力，這眞是意料中出於意料之外的。因了這六君子案，在下却不知所云的生了極大的感觸。</p>
<p>所謂反革命也者，據我草包想起來，總不外爭圖謀顚覆所在國政府那一手而已。我記得前年有一對不知國籍的夫婦，在上海設了大本營，宣傳共産，鼓動工潮，組織農工軍，圖謀顚覆中國政府，創造蘇維埃。鐵一設的證據，人贓並獲。這麽一回事，若是犯在别國裏，哼，不用說得，有一百個，也死五十雙了，總没有像中國那麽宰相壯裏好撑船，大老爺筆底超生，判一個無期徒刑，儘着他們倆做一世牛奶麵包消化機就算了。究竟我們中國，不失大國丰度，大人不記小人過。英國因爲蘇俄要處治六君子，便認爲事情重大，國交緊張。據我看來，也不免小題大做。爲甚麽呢？哪，我國旅日旅鮮的僑胞，同英國旅俄的僑胞，彼此彼此，免談治外法權。所以我們中國同胞在日本統治區域内犯了日本法律，日本人對中國人格殺勿論，中國人對日本人，死而無怨。就是住在上海而已歸化的韓人台人，動不動就被日本人捉去治罪，中國何嘗鐵靑着臉，中日國交，何嘗緊張過？就這一點，已够表明中國的不愛淘氣，不像人家那麽怕太平。</p>
<h3>上海晨話</h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>丨晨行太保的黎明三景丨</p>
<p>張若谷先生寫了幾篇「上海夜話」，大約張先生是過「夜鶯生活」的，所以夜話的資料很多。在下一年到頭做的是「晨行太保」，大抵張先生哈着呵欠，把腦袋安上枕兒的時候，在下已哈着呵欠，預備拐着腿，做馬路巡閱使了。所以讀了「上海夜話」，牙養癢地，來一下子「上海晨話」玩玩。</p>
<p>同我過一樣生活的，是絲廠女工。不拘走到怎裏，一道兒的，總有幾位手提小飯籃，鶯嗔燕叱的陪着走。我對伊們望一眼，伊們也很同情的望我一眼，或許伊們内心裏正默唱着「天緣呀，巧遇……」，雖然我没請敎過伊們的芳名，究竟是阿招姐呢，還是阿巧妹。</p>
<p>站在馬路角屋擔下的「巡捕先生」。當你挨身走過時。他會在黑暗裏蠢動着嚇你一大跳。所以我走過這種所在，在三步之外，總先裝上一聲假咳嗽，當作口令。「巡捕先生」先吃一驚，二足一挺，向我行一下注目禮。這呌做先發制人。</p>
<p>望平街的早市，不是我撤謊，比了十六舖，還要早上三分鐘。我每晨走過望平街時，老槍，小脚，大姑娘，不孩子，各式各樣，一應俱全的報販們，都背着袋，活像去朝山進香。而那種爭先恐後的精神，又活像十九路軍的大刀隊。待到報到手了，蹲在水門汀上摺疊分配的情形，我無以名之，名之曰沉着應戰</p>
<p>這是上海的黎明三景，是上海人所不易領略的。此外如沉沉欲睡的燈光，蜷頭縮頸的黄包車夫，睡在過街樓下的流浪者，也祗有「晨行太保」纔看得見。至於倒馬桶啦，小菜塲啦，這些那些，至早總總在天明以後，瞠乎其後。</p>
<h3>摩登對話</h3>
<p>— 趙子明</p>
<p>（甲）現在一般所謂摩登女子，做起事來，都不能脚踏實地。</p>
<p>（乙）你何以見得？</p>
<p>（甲）你看！伊們穿了高跟鞋，行起路來，總是脚尖着地·這不是一個鐵證嗎？</p>
<p>（乙）我說現在一般所謂摩登男子，都是滑頭。</p>
<p>（甲）你也何以見得？</p>
<p>（乙）你瞧！他們的頭鬚用史丹康塗得晶光，蒼蠅飛上去，也要滑倒，這不是滑頭的證據嗎？</p>
<p>（甲乙）哈哈摩登男女，原來如此？！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二回陃室結芳鄭暗欽健叟　家擇良伴痛詆貧娃</p>
<p>本來他有這大年紀了，要規規矩矩聚一房家着。，舊式的也好，自由的也好，，我們做哥嫂的，不必去反對他。可是他怎麽會把做女工的姑娘看上了。那孩子就是一個寡婦娘，家裏窮得只剩一張土坑，這樣子和精之親密，保不定會鬧什麽笑話。剛才他又借了送衣服爲名，走進院子來，我就說精之不在家，打發伊走了。甘太太一面檢理衣服，　顼聽話，這時沉了臉色，依然是看着箱子裏，却放重了聲音道：這只有怪自己人，不能怪别人。你呌着精之。好好敎訓他一頓就是了。那姑娘和我做活，有時不要錢，倒是個好人。只要精之不去引誘人家，他也就不好意思跟着來的了。厚之聽了這話，却也是有理，口裏啣了烟捲，兩手背在身後，就向精之屋子裏走來。精之已經把那件新作好的罩袍罩在棉袍子外，正想向外走，丁頭却碰到了自己哥哥，倒可以表示着自己的節儉，因笑道：我也穿上藍布大褂了。厚之冷冷的道：做事不應當光注重表面。一個人穿了藍布大褂，就可以算是儉樸的人嗎，精之因爲靠哥哥的勢力，在河工局才有一個職務，哥哥的話，怎敢違抗，紅了臉。站在一邊，没有說話。厚之正了臉色道：我知道你並非重這件衣服，乃是重做這件衣服的人。一個人在外面做事，身分總是要的。孔夫子說過，君子不重則不威。我們雖不是十分高貴的門第，我們的親朋友都不錯。單說你嫂子家裏，是怎樣一個人家。你就這樣不長進，和一個做女紅的姑娘，你來我往，非常之要好，虧你還有那個臉子，常常的往他家裏跑。我聽說他家，窮得只有一張光土坑，屋子裏黑得像土牢一樣。你常常跑到他家裏去，那是什麽意思？若是讓人看見了，你有什麽臉子見人。（二一）</p>
<h3>說話的訓練夏天</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>丨可惜人是已死增了！丨</p>
<p>有位朋友曾問我：你怎麽不多歡喜說話？我起初疑惑他怎麽問起我這句話來，靈機一動，我才知我的說話從没有得罪過他，而他是常常聽了我的話而發笑的。我得了他這麽一問，我也些微對自己有點兒慶幸，我知道以前和他說話很多的，可幸從没和他抵觸過。我也知道自己的確肯少說話了。</p>
<p>要是得天獨厚，能不多歡喜說話，或是從磨練上得到的功夫，這樣的人總該慶幸。我的意思不是呌你駁我「那麽人人都變啞吧好了。」啞吧，當然與會說話的人二樣，人人都是啞吧，我也不說話起來，别人也不會找出個「啞吧」的名詞來與我的說話對照，在這時人人未變啞吧之前，應該慶幸的總是少說話的人。</p>
<p>就照現在「啞吧」還是個不常的事實時，會說話的人裝做啞吧，也究竟比不成文格的吟風弄月和自炫炫人的許多無聊爲有聊。就說遭人嘲笑，比較還是便宜些，科學點的說法。</p>
<p>最好，在做中國國民，說話總要有訓練的·我們是名哲古國，文敎鼎盛，你死不應該做一個不幸運的人，跨進茶坊酒肆·「禁談國事」；古詩：各人自掃門前雪，莫管他家瓦上霜：聖人的話：明哲保身。這些你就該知出産的背景。你的動機良善，你的態度光明，你的理由充足·但，但世會有一個對面，你會受到一個出乎意想渺遙的代表另一眞理的回答。</p>
<p>如果你想走着幸運的路，記着從自己的說話變成圓形，要小心的存着忌諱的心理，你的心理要忘記了這個時代而須退到專制時代去，像專制時代避言「聖諱」一樣。譬如你的對面那位是歡喜吸鴉片烟的，你就不可露出一些些的口音說及鴉片烟的害處，當然不用七不對八講起林則徐來：你看他全神貫注吞雲吐霧意志悠然的時光，你就盛稱鴉片的功效佳妙；你說鴉片是可以止腹痛肚瀉，並可清思提神，這於自己的主張旣施實騐，又博聽者之好感。</p>
<p>請承認，因爲在世上不曾看見人用不屑的神氣去受他人諂媚的恭維，而顯着自然的笑容傾聽他人善意的錯過的指摘。在外國有許多著名的電影明星，或許會把這樣美妙的表情顯露在銀幕上，可恨那一刹那的閃逝，觀不眞切，似乎有「大人先生的遺傳」等文章裏也見過很好文調的形容，可惜人是已死去了！</p>
<p>救國之聲</p>
<h3>空中大學之建議（下）</h3>
<p>— 張亦曾</p>
<p>現在試舉一例以說明各系的組織，假定經濟系請馬寅初先生主任，演講銀行學在上午八時至九時，所謂演講卽以演講片播音，馬敎授可不必親自到塲，九時至十時爲經濟原理，十時至十一時爲會計學，十一時至十二時爲統計學，下午一時至二時爲國際貿易，二時至三時爲商法，三時至四時爲經濟組織，四至五爲勞工問題，五至六爲商史，六至七爲商業信用問題，七至八爲國外兌換，八至九經濟問題，九至十經濟大槪，每天經濟系的電台中，可請一位有經騐商人報告每天商業狀况，此是經濟系的佈音台。若有新鮮學理，可請專家來台演講。其餘我們可以設立國學系，英文學系，哲學系，法學系，敎育系，心理學系等等。至於科學重實騐，那末我們假定每逢星期一三五聽講，二四六到民衆敎育館去試騐，請助敎指導一切，凡學生試騐者，須付保證金若干，以賠償損壞試騐室内器具。去年吳藴初先生捐了幾個免費學額爲化學方面的，考的人很多，可見中國好學的人確很多，錄取的學生很少，然有了空中大學，那這一輩好學的學生，豈非都可以讀書了麽？至於讀工科的學生，可以倣Cincinnati大學六星期讀書，六星期實習，實習之法更爲妥善。</p>
<p>至於考試一項，我們可以倣照英國的學位考試，在未考之先，每個學生須有一個普通考試，像國文英文數學等，普通考試及格，乃可以許有學位考試，普通考試不及格者，不可加入學位考試，學位考試以一系中從頭至尾都要考，若讀哲學者，關於哲學本身及有關於哲學的一切課程都要考，如是行之，空中大學的文憑始有價值。再有人問：「空中大學辦了以後，己設的各公私立大學豈不盡要關門麽？」我說不然，儘有家有資産的，要想享受大學的風光的，而於營業式的大學，敎部正可竭力地取締了。前有一位同學在上海某大學畢業，學士頭銜刻在名片上，我同他談了一刻，方知這樣也就是大學生；再有某大學學生是文學學士，他所說所寫的，外國人不能了解的，我就請問他如何能畢業的呢？他說：「學堂模糊，我亦模糊」。過去再有人問：「開了空中大學，敎授豈不要失業？」我說不然，開學的錢，改開中學以及小學，請各位敎授去做校長，去做敎員，也可有生活之所。</p>
<p>内亂外患，遲早要過去的，中國的建設，中國自己來辦的學校，方能成才致用，靠外國人所辦學校是不勝任的，那有一位洋人眞正赤心忠良來帮忙中國的呢！他們所作所爲，大槪是爲自己利益起見，中國人快快起來向建設路上跑，有錢的人以錢來建設，有力的人用力來救國，有智識的在智識上努力，我們中國數千年的風光，在此苦難中，方再有復興的可能。（如有評議請函寄中華郵政信箱七○二號收）</p>

<h3>止哭文學</h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>前三年，「民族主義文學」家敲着大鑼大鼓的時候，曾有一篇「黄人之血」說明了最高的願望，是在追隨成吉思皇帝的孫子拔都元帥之後，去勦滅「斡羅斯」。斡羅斯者，今之蘇俄也。那時就有人指出，說是現在的拔都的大軍，就是日本的軍馬，而在「西征」之前，尙須先將中國征服，給變成從軍的奴才。</p>
<p>當自己們被征服時，除了極少數人以外，是很苦痛的這實例，就如東三省的淪亡，上海的爆擊，凡是活着的人們，毫無悲憤的怕是很少很少罷。但這悲憤，於將來的「西征」是大有妨碍的。於是來了一部「大上海的毁滅」，用數目字告訴讀者以中國的武力，决定不如日本，給大家平平心；而且以爲活着不如死亡（「十九路軍死，是警告我們活得可憐，無趣！」），但勝利又不如敗退（「十九路軍勝利，祗能增加我們苟且，偷安與驕傲的迷　！」）。總之，戰死是好的，但戰敗尤其好，上海之役，正是中國的完全的成功。</p>
<p>現在第二步開始了。據中央社消息，則日本已有與滿洲國簽訂一種「中華聨邦帝國密約」之陰謀。那方案的第一條是：「現在世界只有兩種國家，一種資本主義，英，美，日，意，法一種係共産主義，蘇俄。現在要抵制蘇俄，非中日聨合起來……不能成功」云（詳見三月十九日申報）。</p>
<p>要「聨合起來」了。這回是中日兩國的完全的成功，是從「大上海的毁滅」走到「黃人之血」路上去的第二步。</p>
<p>固然，有些地方正在爆擊，上海却自從遭到爆擊之後，已經有了一年多，但有些人民不悟「西征」的必然的步法，竟似乎還没有完全忘掉前年的悲憤。這悲憤，和目前的「聨合」就大有妨碍的。在這景况中，應運而生的是給人們一點爽利和慰安，好像「辣椒和橄欖」的文學。這也許正是一服苦悶的對症藥罷。爲什麽呢？就因爲是「辣椒雖辣，辣不死人，橄欖雖苦，苦中有味」的。明乎此，也就知道苦力爲什麽吸鴉片。</p>
<p>而且不獨無聲的苦悶而已，還據說辣椒是連「討厭的哭聲」也可以停止的。王慈先生在（提倡辣椒救國」這一篇名文裏告訴我們說！</p>
<p>「……還有北方人自小在母親懷裏，大哭的時候，倘使母親拿一隻辣茄子給小兒咬很靈騐的可以立止大哭……</p>
<p>「現在的中國，彷彿是一個在大哭時的北方嬰孩，倘使要制止他討論厭的哭聲，祗要多多的給辣茄子他咬。」（大晚報副刋第十二號）</p>
<p>辣椒可以止小兒的大哭，眞是空前絶後的奇聞，倘是眞的，中國人可實在是一種與衆不同的特别「民族」了。然而也很分明的看見了這種「文學」的企圖，是在給人一辣而不死，「制止他討厭的哭聲」，靜候着拔都元帥。</p>
<p>不過，這是無效的，遠不如哭則「格殺勿論」的靈騐。此後要防的是「道路以目」了，我們等待着遮眼文學罷。</p>
<h3>「狂流」與「城市之夜」</h3>
<p>— 玄</p>
<p>明星和聨華兩影片公司近來都以「轉變作風」告。明星的「狂流」和聨華的「城市之夜」便是兩公司最近的代表作。</p>
<p>在技術一方面，因爲「狂流」是取了前年大水災爲題材，而且主要的是羣衆鬥爭，就不及「城市之夜」那樣主要在表現都市黑暗面來得容易見巧。如果「城市之夜」更能得都市觀衆的歡迎，那原因怕就在這一點上。</p>
<p>至於内容，要是我們單看了這兩張片子的說明書，也許覺得仍是「城市之夜」較好，（那說明書實在是新頴的）；可是看過後細細一想，我們的意見就不同了。「狂流」中間穿插着一個戀愛的羅曼司，土豪的女兒戀愛了農民領袖的小學敎師；「城市之夜」中間也有相似的羅曼司，資本家的兒子戀愛了一個女工。同樣的在戀愛中間表示了「父與子」的鬥爭。但是這兩個戀愛有其本質上的不同。在「狂流」，燃旺那士豪女兒的熱情的是對方勇敢光明的人格：但在「城市之夜」，引起了那資本家兒子的戀情的，是什麽呢？從劇情看來，只是淺薄的人道主義，或者竟是所謂神秘的不可解說的愛。「狂流」結尾處寫士豪不死於羣衆的憤怒，而死於水，不免猶有「天網恢恢」的封建臭味，但「城市之夜」的結尾提出「到農村去創造新生活」的口號，也是似是而實非的。因爲農村破産現在已是鐵　般的事實，農村並不是樂士呀！</p>
<p>事實上是農村先破産，所以農民離「城市之夜」裏很濃厚的社會改良政策的傾向使得這張影片在結尾處拖了那個「到農村去」的口號，却把社會現象的因果倒置，使得全影片的都市黑暗描寫失去了暴露的意義了丨也就在這一點上，「狂流」和「城市之夜」意議上的本資是不同的！「狂流」雖然還有多少缺點，尙不失爲暴露社會黑暗的影片。</p>
<h3>柳宗元先生來函</h3>
<p>自由談編者轉胡懷琛先生鑒：你登在申報上的兩封信，和登在民報上的一篇文，我都看見了。你的第一信，似乎都認錯，我很佩服你的坦白：你的第二信，又說因爲我的文章做得不好，所以使得你看錯，這我也可以承認。我的文章也許眞做得不好。因爲學古是不會學得好的。但我的文章所以那樣做，恰正因爲你所提出的兩種用意：（一）是同一名詞用得太多；（二）是同一名詞兩個相隔太近。試看</p>
<p>（一）我的第一句如老實寫出來便成：石魚之山。全石。無大草木，山小而高，其形如立魚，在仙弈西，有穴類仙弈。</p>
<p>有兩個「仙弈」相重。再看</p>
<p>（二）我的第二句如老實寫出便成：</p>
<p>黃溪距州治七十里。由東屯南行六百步，至黃神祠。黃神祠之上，兩山牆立，……黄神祠之上，揭水八十步，……</p>
<p>有三個「黃神祠」相重。故我以爲應該變花樣，於第一句用「多秭歸」來代去了一個「仙弈」字樣，成：</p>
<p>石魚之山，全石，無大草木，山小而高，其形如立魚，在多秭歸西，有穴類仙弈。</p>
<p>於第二句則於第二第三個「黃神祠」都加以省略：第二個「黃神祠」省去「黃神」留着「祠」字；第三個「黃神祠」留着「黄神」省去「祠」字，成：黃溪距州治七十里。由東屯南行六百步，至黃神祠。祠之上，兩山牆立，……黃神之上，揭水八十步……。</p>
<p>這就是我變出的花樣。我的花樣也許變得不好，但我確是這樣變的。望你承認。你說我學古學得不好，所以使得你會看錯，這也許是事實，但你看錯了我的文章也是事實。所以道歉一層，我們大家业阖銷了罷。</p>
<p>柳宗元啓（三月二十二日）編者按：從柳先生的信中，我們可以得着一個小小的敎訓，即是：摹古確是不行。柳先生因爲摹倣山海經，硬把他的文章變了許多不必要的花樣，害得胡君望文生義　鬧了一些笑話，又勞柳先生親自出來指點，枉費許多精力，眞是何苦丨但柳先生摹古摹得不好是一件事，胡君看錯了柳先生的文章另是一件事，柳先生的文章被人誤解了，現在非但不惱，而且自己承認不該摹古，這也就見得古人「虚懷若谷」「從善如流」了丨</p>
<h3>巴黎談屑</h3>
<p>— 蕭石君寄自巴黎</p>
<p>（七）梅特林的悲喜劇</p>
<p>梅特林這個名字在祖國己有許多人知道。他不僅是比利時的大劇曲家，他簡直是二十世紀新浪漫派劇曲最成功的人物之一。可是他本身也演了一齣悲喜劇。自從前年盧布朗（Ceargette　Leblanc）夫人刋布一本迴憶錄後，我們才知道一個大槪，去年的朋友哈利（Gerand　Harry）作了一本「梅特林的生涯及其作品」（La　Vie　et　laeuvre　de　Maurice　Macterlinck），其中一章也說起這齣悲喜劇。事情是這樣的：一八九五年梅特林和一位渴慕他的名女優盧布朗夫人相遇，雖則那時他已有三十四歲，但還未和其他女人正式結過婚。盧布朗固非常愛慕他，他也非常愛盧布朗。於是不久他們倆便實現了同居的計畫。梅特林初期的作品很帶悲觀主義的色彩，例如「瑪蓮公主」「闖入者」「羣盲」「屋内」等均表出對於死的恐怖和運命的神秘。及至和盧布朗同居後，第二年發表的「阿格娜嬛與綏利柔特」，以及一九○二年的「蒙娜凡娜」便由悲觀的一變而爲樂觀的了。批評家都說梅特林因和盧布朗同居，發生了内心生活的蛻變。同居的時候，盧布朗夫人剛好二十歲。她對梅特林的景仰和梅特林對於她的熱愛，現在我們可由盧布朗夫人著的「迴憶錄」中所摘錄的兩人的通信看出。但他們兩人的情誼到一九一九年正式宣告破裂。因爲是年梅特林和一位與盧布朗夫人一同演劇的年輕的女子正式舉行了結婚禮。</p>
<p>盧布朗夫人生於洛安（Rouen）。她的家境頗好。她的父親是一個船公司的經理。因爲有錢，很愛收藏古董。她的哥哥非常喜歡文藝，并且寫過一些小說。他給她的影響極大。盧布朗夫人幼時讀的文藝書籍，都是他的哥哥買給她的。她從他的口中第一次聽到梅特林這個名字。他原很愛讀梅特林的作品。他告訴她有人稱梅特林爲比利時的莎士比亞。所以後來盧布朗夫人到比利時京城奏藝，很想找機會去認識梅特林。終於在一位有名氣的律師家裏看到梅特林了。旁人剛把梅特林的名字報出，她禁不住呌出口來：「多麽幸事，他還這般年輕」！因爲她未見梅特林以前，這位有名氣的律師看見她那麽傾倒梅特林，特意和她開玩笑說：「你還不知道，他已經是個老頭子了。」盧布朗夫人當卽回說：「管他呢，他是我的上帝」。</p>
<p>據她的「迴憶錄」說，她十六歲時候就死了母親。母親死後，她父親因悼亡的緣故，常在家裏閙脾氣。她悶不過，急想和人約婚，以便離開這沉悶的家庭。於是糊裏糊塗和一位西班牙少年訂了婚。訂婚後，發見這少年許多壞處，她的父親向他要求解除婚約。這少年因此服毒列弛。而哈利則說她的丈夫是一個冒險家，因爲别的事情不得不隠藏起來，雖然可以猜度他是死了，但是没有死亡的憑證。在法律的前面，她無從解除婚約。她雖和梅特林同居有二十年之久，没有正式宣布和梅特林結婚，就是這個緣故。（未完）</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張貫平</p>
<p>「林先生，你不要把我當鄉下人看待喲！這可惡，林先生！」</p>
<p>她又向他作了一下鬼臉，跟着是一陣媚笑。</p>
<p>「不是這個意思。因爲我也是剛才才知道有這種東西，是一個敎授告訴我的。」</p>
<p>「那麽，林先生是鄉下人了。哈哈。我試嘗嘗看，看味道好不好。」</p>
<p>她拆開了一包，抽出一片，立即送入她的口裏去了。</p>
<p>「林先生，道是西洋人在接吻前要吃的香口糖，你知道麽？」</p>
<p>她又笑着說。她的嘴唇上流出一點白泡沫來了。她的那種不客氣的態度，有些引起了他的反感。</p>
<p>「…………………………………………」</p>
<p>海泉只是微笑着搖了搖頭。同時他暗暗地悔恨昨天錯過了機會，没有和鶴子夫人接吻，同坐在汽車裏時，爲什麽不嘗嘗和異性親嘴的滋味呢。</p>
<p>「林先生，你多吃一點，好K……i……ss！」　低著頭說·</p>
<p>「我没有對象！」</p>
<p>他感着自己的雙頰在發熱，也笑了。</p>
<p>「不要騙我了，林先生！誰不知道你有了情人了！告訴我，你的Sweet　heart是怎樣的美人？……」</p>
<p>海泉想，不錯了，一定是曹世光把昨天在兆豐公園看見鶴子夫人的事情告訴了他的老婆了。</p>
<p>「没有這回事。的的確確没有的。」</p>
<p>「好在有人看見了。」</p>

<p>新豐洋行報告週三紐約股市呆滯、上落無定、變動亦微、投機家大多觀望、靜候發展、榖價因西南區下甘霖而跌、又據鋼鐵雜誌報告、本週鋼鐵工作量爲百分之十四、較前週又降百分之一、目下鋼鐵工業因受銀行風潮之打擊、迄未恢復、但市塲銷路刻在發展云、本日成交數共九十九萬股、茲將道瓊斯指數等列左、</p>

<h3>棉紗跌風稍殺</h3>
<p>紗市晨跌午漲、但形勢仍平、不過連跌多日、有一部份獲利者乘機抵補、但實需依然滯遲、各帮仍無活動消息、所以人心尙疲弱、總之存貨濃厚、壓力尙重也、</p>

<h3>棉花平靜中帶硬化</h3>
<p>棉市仍平靜、海外棉市大跌小回頭、買方大戶吸收之額安然不動、觀高心思頗濃、關緊不放、因此市勢較硬、惟紗市日跌、原棉反見微高、此種情形、何能持久、至於海外棉市狀况亦屬平淡之象、</p>

<h3>糧食河下米續跌角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源二十餘號、城鄉店胃因大雨滂沱、作客寥寥、市况遂呈疲弱、價落角許、包胃動辦千餘名、薄稻市况尙見平穏、惟次貨亦軟角砠、陰變元及杜洋尖形勢呈懈、價軟五分至角許</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來源二十餘號、白粳去路晨刻取巧稍化、後因天宫陰雨、斛開無幾、市形又疲壧分、薄粳早稻到少消呆、價帶疲勢、羊杜埠白尖亦帶軟勢、陰元乏到、白元定格、</p>
<h3>客秈跌價動銷</h3>
<p>昨日客秈到頭不多、惟自前日疲落後、昨又跌一角左右、尤以江西機晚及湖南機紅新有到頭、趨勢更軟　米貨少尙定、但行情連小三角以後、乃引起閩帮之繼續問津、本街亦以價落問津、市面乃引起閩帮之繼續問津、本街亦以價落問津、市面乃以價小而轉活動、昨由本街辦去江西機晚一百包、又湖南機紅二百包、福州帮辦去湖南機紅八百包、又　紅四十七包、又高　靖二百四十八包、</p>
<p>人心冷淡無神</p>
<h3>粉價跌度尙微</h3>
<p>昨日粉市　呈盤旋平疲之象、以洋麥報價又小二三四角左右不等、照此種景象、國外之麥底依然過剩、未來之傾銷仍不能免、所以市塲抛售雖未濃厚、人心則冷淡無神、至就目下之洋麥進口而言、殊覺暢盛無比、大小廠均日夜駁卸、行家定貨同時到者亦甚夥、麥船之待卸者、竟至吳淞相接、此種情形、設無大連一帶之暢裝、本埠之積粉、旣覺甚巨、且難免再度之奔潰矣、上下午各盤均見小勢、跌則有限、結果本月份較前日小二厘半、四月份至七月份、各小五厘、八月份小二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期麥交易僅十餘車</h3>
<p>丨現麥祗到四十三包丨</p>
<p>（期麥）昨上下午開盤後、各月份市面、異常清淡、洋麥報價、雖見步、跌惟行家套頭不出、卽出亦無受戶、致各月份買賣、陷入停頓、聞全日所開數量、祗十餘車、可見無聊之至、惟現洋麥昨又有成交、坎拿大二號麥四月份裝船、價三兩五錢、由各廠合定一船、</p>
<p>（現麥）現貨來源缺乏、久無市面、昨泰潤運到紹興麥四十三包、貨品尙佳、價做三兩一錢八、由粉廠吃去、</p>
<h3>雜糧荳餅絶少上進力量</h3>
<p>（黄豆）昨車豆廠胃雖　　、然市仍疲　、計成交正　豆四車、價三兩八、市因貨品見高、價售原　、崇明沙黄豆做開八百包、乃廣厦兩帮辦去、市面亦好錢許、</p>
<p>（紅糧）江北帮辦　　接、市呈平局、昨成交三百餘包、價開二兩四錢八及四錢七分、</p>
<p>（餅市）豆餅昨市則有一千片交易、爲厦門帮辦去、市　一兩三錢五分二釐半、照此跌價、尙少承受、後情尙難站定、</p>
<p>糖市</p>
<h3>海南赤建冰一漲一跌</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、以標金略跌、荷匯回長、趨勢復軟、公會劃盤二四粗砂白、普通貨呌十五兩一錢、中砂白及荷赤亦呌原價、均少成交、眞正國産綿赤到百餘包、昨　十一兩二錢、　　因貨主來電不肯　卸、市勢　　、當　出六百包之　、價爲八兩七至八兩四五錢、比前日好起五分、提莊靑前貨已通、　到　百數十包、　　索價九兩二、尙未成交、海南赤因前跌過甚、而貨客來電硬扳、布勢突緊、昨開百餘包、價爲十兩、比前升起三錢許、建冰以銷路不振、趨勢疲弱、故標準五　白冰價已轉降、昨開百餘箱、每砠價爲十三兩、比前跌去三錢、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金菜針銷呆轉軟</h3>
<p>金針菜近以粤銷不動、市勢轉軟、聞行方對粤帮新秤拆實問題、迄未妥洽、别帮採數亦不多、價遂見降、現市上莊爲十六兩許、中莊十四兩半、　次菜六七兩不一、市象平疲、</p>
<p>絲茶</p>
<h3>土莊珍眉略有成交</h3>
<p>昨日婺　東北兩路珍眉、因國外　價過低、談判難於就範、全市祇怡和·同孚等行、買進土莊珍眉一百十二箱、扯價三十五兩、各路紅綠茶、均無交易、茶市仍難　爲樂觀云、</p>
<p>疋頭　春夏流行的毛織物</p>
<h3>内地客帮辦胃甚健</h3>
<p>邇來内地客帮若首都·寗波·鎭江·常熟·蘇州·無錫·蕪湖·南驼等埠、各該號經理咸親自來申選配各種春夏需銷之毛織物極夥、似素色與條子法蘭絨·中厚嗶嘰·華特呢·好歹之西裝套頭花呢·人字春大衣呢·　貢　　嗶嘰之類、　有添　、除舊有往來外、大　均現欵交易、所　之貨、先後交　　轉　公司　往云、</p>
<h3>油市　洪桐油春銷零落</h3>
<p>洪江　油、正當春銷之際、然去路未若往年之盛、其最大原因、實爲内地農村經濟竭　、且滬上號家自裁　後、營業迭見衰落、從前集中市塲、已散漫　無遺、浙路嘉湖一帶、均向蘇州採辦、董水道裝運、已無釐卡阻礙、路程亦近、便利正多、故蘇州洪　銷塲、近二三年來、大有蓬勃氣象、本埠市面、依然無發展可能、副洪如　元豐前曾售過十五兩八錢、茲聞十五兩六錢亦有肯售、核之成本、實無利可圖、乃查進貨方面、客家意甚堅固、並無廉望、可見非市面之疲而　也、</p>

<h3>接洽四强公約經過</h3>
<p>主張現行條約有修改必要</p>
<p>路透二十三日倫敦電　英首相麥唐納今日在下院發表爲衆極所欲聞之言論、述其游日内瓦羅馬與巴黎之經過情形、英相謂當渠與西門外相抵日内瓦時、</p>
<p>軍縮瀕於崩潰　彼等覺軍縮會議已在崩裂之危險中、蓋各方對於細則、意見各異、工作莫能進行也、</p>
<p>承認德國平等　彼等不得已乃以平等許德國、今日已非列强以聨合力量强抑任何歐洲民族使之屈就其所認爲與自己尊榮抵觸的義務之時期、渠與西門外相深知今必須揭明者、加於歐洲任何國家之義務、乃榮譽且有責任的義務、而尤爲重要者、以此義務係自願担任者也、但近來所發生之事實、已大增目前依此而行之危險、是以英國計畫主張在過渡時代中平等本身未可實施、但求不再備戰而已、歐洲現甚不寗、而處於極惶恐狀態中、但軍縮會議因渠與西門外相之干涉、已復有生氣云、英相繼言及羅馬之游、謂到羅馬後、意相墨索里尼示以簡短文件、</p>
<p>發起四强合作　擬發起歐洲四强之合作以非戰公約精神維持和平、並對於德國在原則上承認其地位平等、意相計畫主張此四强相約不得用武力以解决任何當前政治困難、並主張立即依照國聨盟約第十九條修正條約、</p>
<p>公約有效十年　如此計畫可成公約、則此公約有效時期爲十年、今英政府將籌擬細則、庶意相計畫應以修正條約爲唯一旨趣、而非一般的和平旨趣云、議員有詢問「修改條約與一般的和平旨趣」之意義者、英相答稱、渠意此計畫不僅有一般的和平旨趣、但須以和平的組織爲其主要唯一旨趣耳、</p>
<p>不欲擯除小國　此計畫必不屏絶小國參加、因小國在若干方面上較諸大國尤有更大關係、以期銷滅因現有條約而起之衝突原因云、英相末稱、當不可避免的國家主義之復興、使和約重付討論時、此種計畫可防免歐洲之危險云、當道旋對於首相所稱修改條約與一般的和平旨趣一語發表負責之說明、謂首相聲稱英政府將籌議此計畫之細則、庶此計畫可不僅以和平爲一般的旨趣、且可不以修正條約爲一個大的而幾乎是唯一的細則云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十三日倫敦電　首相麥唐納在下院陳述外交情形、會塲人滿爲患、各國外交代表亦多蒞塲、由麥相演說觀之、可見英意當局之目的、在於修改現行條約、惟目下立即實行之手續、則尙未確定、麥氏謂德國軍備問題、長爲混亂之原因、歐洲目下種種困難、亦均由此而起、歐洲如欲採取一種可以持久之政策、則必須以軍備平等權畀予德國、麥氏以簡括之文件、說明意相墨索尼里之計畫、而於其實行之細目則未嘗涉及、其主要精神、爲德國允許與英法意合作、而三國則保證就軍備平等原則對德讓步、以爲交換、麥氏根據國聨會盟約第十九條法理、主張現行條約有修改之必要、如四國能在國聨會範圍以内實行合作、則英國即就意相計畫、考慮實行之方法、其唯一重要者爲修改條約方法、但麥唐納對各保守黨保證修改條約、必不牽涉英國殖民地、對於各小國如有動作、亦必先徵求其意見、在各該國未表示意見以前、决不輕於更動云、</p>
<p>（按國聨盟約第十九條規定、大會可隨時請聨合會會員復核已經不適用之條約、並考慮足以危及世界和平之國際情勢、）</p>
<h3>禁械與軍縮問題</h3>
<p>英下院有質問</p>
<p>路透二十三日倫敦電　外交次官艾登大尉今日在下院述及建議禁止軍火運往遠東事、謂在短時間内欲商定國際行動、實不可能、許多國家必取獲得彼等今日所未有之權力、就英國在已往數星期中所得之經騐觀之、將來欲取此種有效力的行動、則必須先設施此行動之機關云、議員問日内瓦之談判是否根據單禁軍火運往侵略國之主張而進行、艾登答稱、就英國所發起者而論、爲對軍火輸往遠東問題加以研究、該問題必須經國際的研究與裁决、始能有效、一國斷不能言他國應如何行事云云、艾登次乃述及一般軍縮問題、謂羅馬所提出建議之結果、小國亦有參加之機會、此項計劃他日經營時、將在國聨結構内經營之、英國之軍縮計劃、包羅各種建議、有爲出席軍縮會議六十國接受之最佳機會、如軍縮會議願接受較計劃中所定略低之壧字、英國亦無異議、總之、如各國代表簽定如今日之草約、則軍縮可成就甚大之部分、而會議可免遭失敗、國際接受之大有希望、此實爲一佳兆、渠之所以抱樂觀者、因出席軍縮會議之各國、今須於英國計劃與類乎此者之計書中擇一從之、否則須忍受會議失敗之後果也云云、</p>

<p>談言爲人好機會  濟　　處今蠻幹横行，公理毁滅之世界，一民族遭遇外侮，若不具有最大犧牲之决心，以作偉大英勇之奮鬭，從茫茫苦海中，力圖渡登彼岸，而從强暴之魔掌中，拼命奪取正義，無疑的其民族之生命及靈魂，必隨强暴者鐵蹄之所之而喪滅消失，且也，物競天擇，適者生存，設不幸一民族之生命力而已操諸强暴者之掌握中，而今而後，猶作「翻一翻身」之幻想，固然也有希望，除非硬等到世界大革命之爆發。可是世界大革命，也要自己能下更偉大更激烈之犧牲决心，庶可抓住「好機會」而不讓它錯過。　　暴日魔掌，始一伸至熱河邊境，無恥已極的湯部一類的軍隊，便嚇得屁滾尿流，節節退却，終於未聞槍砲聲而即放乘承德。暴日餘威未已，大局似已不可爲，抑知捷音乍至，竟有孫殿英部未奉總部命令，敢作絶塞孤軍之殊死戰，以挫敵人之銳氣，并鎭住我方之陣線。嗣又繼以「三師團結如家人手足」之宋哲元部，敢取攻勢，屢獲勝利。最近各報又載「孫殿英部將請全線反攻令，彼部願先驅克承德之佳音，異哉！平日不甚爲人注目之孫殿英部，何竟突然有此足吞斗牛之壯氣？怪而問之，則曰：「今日乃我等做人好機會」（見二十日各報），吾人欣然逖聽之餘，不難想見其人不特具有最大犧牲决心，奮鬭精神，且有卓然獨具之隻眼，看破二十一年來，齒還齒，目還目，「什麽之役什麽之戰」的輪迴式的内爭，每次鬩牆煎豆，不惜殺人盈城盈野。而一般身爲慘無人道之人屠戶，任隨屠行老閭之指揮，歷此慘無天日之人屠塲，自然不是「做人的好機會」，亦即非起碼的「做人之道」，厥理甚明。今聞孫氏鐘鼓之音，能不内疚神明，翻然覺悟，快把槍口一致對準暴軍，以建奇動，而贖前愆耶？　　不遇風霜，不知松柏之勁節，孫氏能認識與暴日作戰，反攻熱河，乃「爲人好機會」，顯係站在整個民族利益之立塲，不惜犧牲，以作反帝之鬭爭。先聲一播，倘得全國軍隊，奮起影響，則最後勝利之凱歌，必將遠從塞外，頻頻傳至！利用死人？  星墅　　丨說不完許多孝子賢孫丨　　「死了的姑娘，是好姑娘」這是我們故鄉中流行的俗語，所以這年頭兒，要受人讚譽或擁護，還是死了較爲容易，否則，尙未壽終正寢之前，往往是受人攻擊，甚至希望他早死早好。　　我們祗要看一般闊老名流，一遇到父母病故，便會擴大宣傳，要表示哀悼，先發訃文，用盡生平之力，叙述未死的兒孫如何如何的好，官居幾品，名傳何方，歷任要職……好似這門人家的各個履歷表，歸根結底；都　是父母敎養之功，眞是鍾靈毓秀人家，所以父母西逝，兒女悲痛是小事，趁這個機會，把自己的豐功偉烈資格學問，表揚出來給大衆觀光，倒是不容忽視的工作。還有，父母的屍體，裝殮在棺材内，本該可以埋葬了，但因爲要擺闊綽，特地雇了許多人，抬着棺材，遊街示衆，走遍了繁華街頭，成羣結隊，陳列了許多飾物，恨不得把存在銀行的鈔票，一齊提出來貼在孝服之上，而且深恐别人誤會他不是孝子賢孫，特地留意痛哭，給家人扶着慢慢地一步一步走，以表明這樣的子孫，旣有錢，又孝順，簡直也可進得聖廟，立得孝牌坊。　　其實，父母生時，也許因爲代訂了婚約，駡父母爲頑固，或者不肯多給錢供子孫化用，被認爲守財奴，駡他老不死……然而一旦死了，父母便是賢明的父母，子孫也是孝順的子孫了，死者一了百了，倒也未必十分計較，生者却利用死人一代自己出出風頭，這也彷彿是子孫們應享的權利。啊！啊！所以不要怪自古以來，許多偶像，都是利用了死人做成。　　然而，也有例外，被官廳槍斃殺頭的人們，因爲是被槍斃，被殺頭，罪狀是罄竹難書，雖然是死了，却没有人們當作好人贊譽，這是證明殺得不錯的緣故呢？科學烟幕  密　　自有飛機以來，平面戰爭即變爲立體戰爭，後方之營房，輜重，及前方軍隊前進行動，坦克車及砲位等，皆有被飛機偵察及襲擊之危險，故烟幕蔽遮尙矣，滬戰時，吳淞之役，敵藉烟幕之遮蔽，偷渡過河，我軍莫能辨，敵竟得逞，此烟幕之力也。前有評熱戰者曰：「熱河若能抵抗三月，則熱河有望矣。蓋不三月後，草木長大，靑紗帳（北方蔓草頗高猶靑紗帳，故名）起，則敵機與敵砲，無所取其的矣。」嗚呼！豈知不及「靑紗帳」之起而熱地已失矣！嗚呼！祇知望天之賜我以「靑紗帳」，而不知取科學法而使用烟幕，亦云可憐矣！烟幕之效用頗大，他如前線建築，橋梁之架設，皆宜用烟幕蔽掩之，我軍飛機之通過敵方陣地，欲避免敵軍高射砲之射擊，亦可用烟幕蔽之。海軍中，我軍艦可放烟幕以免敵魚雷之攻擊，或用以掩護進攻，或分隔敵軍艦隊，以集中我之攻擊力而圍攻。　　烟幕之爲物，乃固體或液體之細粒，其徑約自IO</p>
<p>4至IO</p>
<p>5糎。烟幕之色皆宜白，蓋白烟之籠罩力大於黑色烟也，今略述各種烟幕化學如下：</p>
<p>（一）白磷</p>
<p>磷爲固體，沸點爲2870C，熱至6。。C，在空氣中，磷即燃燒，成五氣化磷：</p>
<p>2P+5。=P2O5</p>
<p>五氣化磷爲白色固體，發生時，出熱36.94加路里。五氣化磷與水，化合爲磷酸：</p>
<p>2P2O5+6H2O=4H3PO4</p>
<p>此磷酸再吸空中水汽，以成稀磷酸溶液，成微粒狀，彌佈空中，即爲烟幕，聞之有蒜臭。一磅磷，若經完全燃燒後，由計算可得3.16磅烟霧。</p>
<p>（二）三氣化硫</p>
<p>通常用接觸法製造之，接觸媒劑爲白金網·用唧筒將二氣化硫SO2和空氣打入一接觸器中。器内有直立管一列，管上設有白金網，先熱直立管，二氣化硫經過其上時發熱，而與氣氣化合，而成三氣化硫，在尋常温度下極易揮發，所發出之氣體與空中之水份化合，成硫酸，此硫酸，在尋常温度下不能揮發，故凝結而成霧，其反應如下：</p>
<p>SO2+O=SO3</p>
<p>SO3+H2O=H2SO4</p>
<p>令三氣化硫與硫酸化合，則成發烟硫酸（Oleum）亦能用爲烟幕。</p>
<p>（三）四鹽化砂（Silicon　Tetrachloride）</p>
<p>此爲無色液體。比重爲1.52，沸於57006氣狀比重爲5.94。貯於罐中另一罐盛亞莫尼亞，當施放時，齊開兩罐，則四鹽化矽與亞莫尼亞化合，再遇空中水分而成白烟，反應如下：</p>
<p>Sice4+NH3+H2O=Si（OH）4+NH4C）</p>
<p>（四）四鹽化鐟（Titanium　Te　　　chlorie</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（十一續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「貴姓」伍逸讓她對面那一張沙發上坐下之後先想自管自的看報暫時不睬她：却禁不起這位姑娘，老是把一雙清秀得像明星一般的眫子注視着他，似乎很要說話的神氣，伍逸便不得不從請問姓名着手，開始和她敷衍起來。</p>
<p>「敞姓麥，…………麥娥便是我的名字！」極率直而乾脆的答復。</p>
<p>「啊！女戲子！」伍逸暗暗地吃驚着，「想不到一個女戲子，竟是這樣的大方而幽靜，………又是這樣的美麗………！」</p>
<p>「原來是麥老板。久仰得很！」他用一種羨慕和愉快的目光，看着這一位鼎鼎大名的女戲子，正式和她攀談起來；同時，少不得也說出了自己的名姓。</p>
<p>麥娥是一個受過中等敎育的女人，識見很高；雖然她是一個女戲子，可是她平日的行動，却眞足以羞死一般把書本子做裝飾品的女學生。她說話極深刻，每一句話都很夠人回味，有時會使人難堪得要死，有時會使人笑得淌出眼淚來。這些，都在大王唱生公司的兩小時的談話裏，給伍逸很清楚地認識了；從這天起，他才知道女人並不是個個是俗的，女人並不個個是淺見的，在一般庸脂俗粉之外，還有這麽一支不同凡艶的奇葩，於是他就開始向一個極不尋常的女性，發生了一種不曾越出友誼範圍以外的欽慕，和依戀</p>
<p>本來，林大平每天晚上總是要上麥娥家裏去的，自從伍逸跟麥娥認識之後，他便不時邀伍逸同去；伍逸跟他去過幾次之後，腿上就像裝了一具機器一樣，每到五點鐘，他便不由自主的跟着林大平一路順風的到了麥娥家裏。後來，他漸漸覺得如其他想做一個人·做一個快樂的人的話，每天的生活日程上就不能少和麥娥說笑幾小時的一課。</p>
<p>但是伍逸是報館記者，麥娥是女戲子，兩人的工作時間，都在晚上，白天又是同樣的需要休息；因此，伍逸漸漸感覺到每天五點以後，跟林大平上麥家去盤桓一兩個鐘頭，委實是太侷促太不便了。有一天，最勇的一天，他竟極大胆地在時辰鐘打過二下之後，當林大平正在太王公司的時候，獨自一個人　到了麥娥的家裏去。</p>
<p>「咦！………你………」伍逸到麥家的時候，恰好麥娥才起身，鵝蛋形的臉上，一些脂粉也没有，清白的像才下過雨的天一樣；不曾穿襪子的天然足上，套着一雙繡花的拖鞋；身上披着粉紅色的浴衣；黑而長的秀髮，披在肩後，站在薰人欲醉的春風裏，眞像我們夢中所見的天上的仙女一樣。</p>
<p>她見了伍逸，便透着一種又羞澀，又歡喜的微笑，迎上前來，伸出象牙彫就一般的手臂，給伍逸卸下了大衣。</p>
<p>「我來得太早了，你忙嗎………？」伍逸瞧麥娥家裏的人，和一班當差配角，都像是才起身的模樣，忙得在各間屋子裏亂轉，心上不由很不安，便靠在一張方桌子的邊上，用道歉的語調間着。</p>

<h3>好萊塢是女子的世界</h3>
<p>— 西容</p>
<p>美國的人們都說「好萊塢的女明星都穿男人袴子的。」雖然在事上，有幾位女明星，是歡喜穿男人袴子的。即如瑪琳黛德麗，平日好著男裝，本刋上已經介紹過。此外曼麗璧克馥，平日亦常穿男人袴子亱　是這句「穿男人袴子」的俗語（Woman　stars“wear　the　pants”），並不是指事實說的。牠的意義就是說好萊塢女子，是駕御男子的。更進一層說，就是好萊塢幾乎是一個女子的世界。</p>
<p>爲什麽呢？從好萊塢一個很顯著的奇特的習慣上，就可以看得出來的。這習慣是什麽呢？就是女明星的丈夫，往往被人家用他女人的名字稱呼他。譬如明明是小范朋克，人家雖知道，但徧徧要稱呼他爲「克勞馥先生，」這就因爲他的老婆是鼎鼎大名的瓊克勞馥。明明人家是佛蘭克費，人家徧要呌他一聲「司丹威克先生，」亦就是這個原故。這亦並不是表明「夫以妻貴，」故夫必須從妻的姓，不過鬧著好玩，相習成風。而爲女明星之丈夫者，亦已敢違背幽默的敎訓，起而反抗，故祗可封之若素了。</p>
<p>所以傑克奥開Jack　Oakie曾以滑稽的口脗說過「牠們儘可將以後結婚的儀式改革一下，從此以後，男人嫁給女人，沿用女人的姓名，住到女人的家裏去。并且還可以再進一步，女子娶了男子，離了婚，再娶一個男子，而每娶一個男子，就給他一個號碼。譬如斯密司小姐第三次結婚的丈夫，就呌做「斯密司第三。」這樣「先生」的稱呼，亦可以廢去了。至於女人，那永是小姐身份，人家總得稱她一聲「密絲」的。</p>
<p>女人永遠稱「密絲」，在好萊塢是盛行的。曼麗特蘭漱六十多歲了，人家總稱她一聲密絲，許多人還當她是老處女呢，其實牠已嫁過丈夫，牠的丈夫早死了。其餘如鼎鼎大名的琵琵但妮兒，史璜遜，珍妮蓋諾，瑙瑪希拉等等，都有丈夫，但是没有稱她們爲夫人的。即如曼麗璧克馥的丈夫，島格拉斯范朋克，名氣最樣大，亦没有能夠將璧克馥的名字抹煞，而稱爲范朋克夫人。在好萊塢，根本上「夫人」的名稱，是不通行的。這點在我們上海，差不多亦有這個風氣。許多交際花，明明家裏有家主公，在外面徧徧不肯說她男人的姓，而必須自稱爲小姐，以致弄出許多笑話出來，并且許多男子上了不少的當。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「博愛」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>（Ｔhe　Man　Who　Played　God）</p>
<p>導演巧妙　表演極佳</p>
<p>全片充滿了靜的美</p>
<p>這是一部不可多得的佳片、</p>
<p>一個出身豪華的中年音樂家，因其演奏技術之高超，頗爲一般婦女所傾倒。其中有一寡婦和一少女與他最爲接近，少女更向他求婚，音樂家以年齡懸殊而拒絶之。旋不久，因一猛烈之巨聲致將音樂家之耳鼓震聾，他心灰意懶，欲自殺。其後他感覺人間之悲苦而不惜捨己愛人，所謂「立心行善」。並使少女去就其所歡。而與其曾經淫亂之寡婦相偕好。</p>
<p>像這樣唯心論的故事，當然，並不會爲我們　讚美。然而在目前的社會結構之下，一般art　for　art的人們，他們所能夠聊以自慰的，便是犑　欺欺人的將藝術視爲超物質的至高無上的東西，甚至於以藝術成爲說敎的工具。於是這一音樂家便應與其音樂相偕亡，至少應在其良心的「得救」之中而將自己「新生」起來。於是他們應當「佈施」於人，於是他們便以其用不了的金錢而「行善」了。</p>
<p>然而其用心雖然可鄙，但故事的結構却是别出巧思，而不同凡響，超特的而不落俗套。雖然，故呈的穿揷非常單純，可是全着重在情節的演進。旣然如此，於是本片的導演和表演都是十分吃力的。</p>
<p>先就導演說：他在開頭時對於全劇的介紹，運用得十分簡單而明瞭，到後來他使用着極長的鏡頭，使主角能夠在極細微的動作中，得以十分生動的表演。他對於所有的配角，都給他充分的發揮而不妨害重要的表演，而且一點也不煩亂。如利用望遠鏡而使全劇得以一步逼緊一步的進展下去，都是十分高明的技巧。總之，他使本劇能夠完全在「靜」的空氣中生長和繁榮，全部是「靜」的美，沉寂的充溢着。這與「棄夫」有着十分相同的情調。當然，這是非常艱難的工作，而必須有着充分的涵養。</p>
<p>至於主角喬治亞立斯（George　Arliss）的表演，那眞是深入化境。我們在他的表演中可以看到他對於本劇有着十足的了解。他將所謂神精質的藝術家的特點完全抓住了而體貼入微，他熱情，他孤高，他瘋狂，他幻滅，即在最平凡的一舉一動之中，都灌注了全身之精力。可以說全部是他一個人的獨角戲，何等吃力？可是正因爲如此，於是他得以盡情的發揮。啊！在這一片中我們不能不承認他是出人頭地的表演能手，他與約翰巴里摩亞，詹寗斯等堪稱電影界中之傑出人材。</p>
<p>在配角中，我們承認那飾Battle的依凡新甫生（Ivan　Sinpson）也演得很好的。</p>
<p>其他如收音，佈景，光線，對白等都很適當而有精采。</p>
<p>「追求」和</p>
<h3>「都會的早晨」</h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>兩國片都不錯</p>
<p>巨幅的廣告上，我們可以找到，新光的「追求，」北京的「都會的早晨，」同時公映了當然牠們兩張影片的作風，劇義……一切一切。都是逈然不同的，不過在不同的道路上，牠們各有所長，都有相當的成功。</p>
<p>我們早已知道了，「追求」是天乙公司的聲片。名噪一時的黎明暉，初次開口作。牠是一幕五角錯綜式的戀愛劇。當然在這種分配下，只可以有兩個人成功。乙和丙結婚了，丁和戌也達利目的了，只有甲一個人，伶仃無偶。不遇他是傻小子一個，應該失敗的，本來他就不夠資格去誤戀愛。那丙和丁兩個人，纔是眞痛苦的，因爲他們的嫁娶，是極牽强的，是金錢下的俘虜婚姻。然而社會上畸形，正是如此。「戀愛」以「同居」爲目的，的確是編劇人的思想太偏了一點。可是在現代中國的環境裏，除結婚以外，也眞没有方法，來形容戀愛的成功，或失敗了。這片子很透澈的來說明，所謂「自由戀愛」的現象丨和買賣婚姻，正是半斤八兩，的確呌不少人，可以醒悟。</p>
<p>導演方面。我不希望說什麽。技術的各方面。我認爲極尋常。攝影和剪接。還算好的。那末除去劇情良好以外。要算表演了。葛慶榮工作很輕。我認爲他不大適宜。黎明暉當日所作的。多一半是活潑的小妹妹。而這次是一個能幹潑辣的女子了。一種傲慢輕浮的態度，形容摩登女性們，入骨三分。國語和表演，都很好。雖然她很合劇中人個性，我終以爲太過火些。馬陋前。作戰有餘，深刻不足。胡嫺工作太少，很可惜。男馬東武，一個「童心」的資本家，很不錯。用滑稽的動作，來挖苦世人，可笑而可恨。張振鐸却是男角最好的。</p>
<p>再談到「都會的早晨。」牠和「城市之夜，」有異曲同工之妙。但是却不似「城市之夜」的有力。牠的劇情裏，我們找到對于社會的認識，的確要比「追求」多一些。當然導演是有功的。如果不厭求全的話，那末全劇組織上，也不少牽强之處。佈景非常好。階級的對照，也增加料彩。攝影比「追求」好一些。當然無聲片對于鏡頭的動作和地位，都比有聲片容易多了。剪接上想。很有思。一個男子的墮落，却仍用舞塲來描寫，是太俗了一點。</p>
<p>至于演員呢。比較重要一點的三位丨王人美，高占非，表叢美，丨在前三本，是由别人代替的。這三個小演員，都還不錯。陸少輝是極有希望的。唐槐秋和王桂林，化裝上，吃一點虧。表演平均都在水平線以上。</p>

<h3>紅塵（Red　dust）（六）</h3>
<p>— 桀克</p>
<p>「你丨丨你不走開嗎？」她嗚咽着請求。</p>
<p>但尼斯冷笑一聲，「我有事要幹。您是不是要我死守着他？」</p>
<p>這女子氣得發抖。她提起手猛的打他一記耳光。但尼斯驚奇地對她看着。慢慢地他的眼睛表現出一種感着眞眞興趣的神情。</p>
<p>「好得很。」他慢慢地温柔地說。「這或可使您解消了些憂愁。」</p>
<p>但尼斯在黃昏時候回到莊上，仍舊在想巴蓓蕾。叢林裏一條老虎又在咆哮。巴蓓蕾從房裏奪門奔到客堂。</p>
<p>「那是什麽？」她顫懍地問。</p>
<p>「那是老虎，」但尼斯很自在地笑着說。「他不會闖進來的。」</p>
<p>「喔丨丨」巴蓓蕾驚魂初定，她正要回到她的房間去，但尼斯就走到好面前。</p>
<p>「今天早上對不住。容我道歉丨丨」他開始說。</p>
<p>「那倒也不必」這女子平心靜氣地說。「您只要把格里醫好就好了。他現在正睡着。」巴蓓蕾正要關房門，但尼斯却阻着。</p>
<p>「咱們現在是不是做了朋友？」他低着聲問。</p>
<p>「有怎麽關係呢？」門當着他面關了。他轉身與麥克和居同同桌坐下，他們很奇異地看着他。「幸而　丹去了，」麥克就說。言猶未了，一個尖銳的聲音憑空地打動他們的耳鼓。</p>
<p>「晞！您們這些寶貝還没睡？」</p>
<p>三個人趕到走廊，窗裏射出的燈光照着　丹的泥濘身體，一手捉着鸚鵡，一手拿着帽子。她的背後來一個船老大，拿着電筒和槍。兩個土人拿着藁丹的箱籠跟着。</p>
<p>「怎麽了？」但尼斯馬上就問。</p>
<p>「一言難盡！慢慢再說罷，」　丹倦極似地說。</p>
<p>「毋噪，知道不知道？一位太太同她的男人在隔壁房裏丨丨他是病人。」但尼斯輕輕地告誡。</p>
<p>「喔丨丨我不知道呀。」這女子的聲音裏帶着關切的意思。「用我帮忙嗎？」</p>
<p>第二天早上，她坐着吃早飯，巴蓓蕾走進客堂，忽然看見另一一女人，心裏驚奇就停了步</p>
<p>「嘿咯，藁丹一見如故的呌着。</p>
<p>「早，」巴蓓蕾二心三意的答着。「我是威列斯夫人。」</p>
<p>「我知道，」　丹回答。「他們告訴我您的丈夫有病。今天他好點了嗎？」</p>
<p>「我不知道，」另一女人疑惑地的說。「是這裏那一位的太太？」</p>
<p>「不。我是　丹占花臣丨丨從阜奇尼亞來的，」　丹很神氣的解釋。</p>
<p>「我是來看看農塲的。我乘船要回西貢去丨丨船擱淺了。我遂跑回……………………我眞的同此地絶無關係，」她看另一女人的眼裏有不相信的樣子，她趕快停住。（未完）</p>

<p>(Leizhou) To accomplish the gains secured on the 22nd, the Huang 〇〇〇 Regiment outside Lengkou, before dawn on the 23rd, flanked and seized enemy positions. The enemy's right wing suffered damage and showed signs of wavering. The fierce fighting ended at noon and then turned into a stalemate.

<h3>He Yingqin Entertains Beiping Press</h3>
<p>Rumors of Sino-Japanese Compromise Not Worth Refuting</p>
<p>Troop Movements are Strategic Actions</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin entertained the press this afternoon. According to him, since the League of Nations report was passed, Japan's acts of aggression have been recognized by the world. Since then, the Sino-Japanese issue has become an issue for the entire League of Nations against Japan. Since our country has accepted the League of Nations report, the path to be taken in diplomacy has been clearly determined and will not change. Recently, there have been rumors of a Sino-Japanese compromise in the outside world. Such unfounded rumors are not worth refuting. Resistance to Japan has been the established policy of our government and the responsibility that should be fulfilled by everyone in the country. No matter how far the Japanese invade, we will fight to the end without any hesitation. Regarding all military deployments, there are overall plans. Troop movements are completely strategic actions. Anyone with a little military knowledge can understand this. Rumors in the outside world involving political strategies and other relationships are likely to have other purposes. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Jiang appointed Tao Jun as Lieutenant General Staff Officer, working at the Beiping Military Branch Council. (23rd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin told foreign reporters this afternoon that the front lines have been relatively quiet recently. Last night at 10:00 PM, the Japanese artillery unit fired on the Chinese army's positions on the Gubeikou front. This morning, a Japanese plane went to Miyun County for reconnaissance but did not drop bombs. That place is about 20 miles inside the Great Wall. Xifengkou has had only small battles in recent days. When asked if he also believed the rumors of Japanese military action in Tanggu and Tianjin, He replied that he did not believe it. He said that the area from Chahar to Shanhaiguan is completely under his jurisdiction. Someone also asked if Chiang Kai-shek would come to Beiping in the future. He replied that if necessary, Chiang would come to Beiping, but there is no need for it at present. He also said that he and Chiang talk on the phone from time to time. Later, someone asked if the Chinese army intended to recover Rehe. He said that China's policy is not only to recover Rehe, but also to recover the three northeastern provinces. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>Additional Appointment of Shao Yuanchong as Member of the North China Office</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Standing Committee discussed the issue of Wang's resumption of office on the 23rd. Because it was necessary to seek Wang's consent first, no specific decision was made. It was slightly heard that Wang had instructed Gu Mengyu to convey to the central government before going to Shanghai that he was going to Shanghai for business and would return to Nanjing in a day or two. He still firmly declined to resume his position as Premier. Gu presented a report at the Standing Committee today. It is heard that as a result, Sun Ke and Gu Mengyu were appointed to go to Shanghai to urge Mr. Wang to return to Nanjing immediately. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Constitutional Drafting Committee Discusses</p>
<h3>Powers of the National Assembly</h3>
<p>The Third and Fourth Groups Hold Joint Meeting Today</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Constitutional Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan held its seventh meeting on the 23rd. Committee Chairman Sun Ke, Vice Chairmen Zhang Zhiben and Wu Jingxiong, and Committee Members Jiao Yitang, Ma Chaojun, and 31 others attended to discuss the organization and powers of the National Assembly. However, because this issue is related to the issue of the central government system of the Fourth Group, the committee members advocated that the Third and Fourth Groups hold a joint meeting. It was decided to hold the meeting on the 24th. According to a certain committee member, there is no precedent for the National Assembly in the constitutions of various countries. Although the Prime Minister stipulated it in the Founding Program, it cannot be used as a constitutional provision. Moreover, the National Assembly is the only meeting mechanism in the transition from political tutelage to constitutional government, and its nature is particularly important. It must be carefully studied. It is estimated that the discussion of the Constitutional Drafting Committee today mainly focused on the issue of the powers of the National Assembly. Some advocated that in addition to the four direct powers, the power to declare war, make peace, and amend and interpret the constitution should also be stipulated. However, the organization of the National Assembly is quite large. If the duties and powers are too great, it will not be easy for representatives from various places to come to Nanjing once. It will not be easy for representatives to come to Nanjing every two or three months for a meeting period. If it is necessary to convene meetings again due to declarations of war and peace, there may be many obstacles in practice. Therefore, some advocate that powers should be restricted. It has not yet been decided whether to establish a permanent responsible body after the National Assembly is closed. Therefore, it seems difficult to specify the details of the powers. As for the constitution, only the general outline of the National Assembly is stipulated, and other detailed rules and regulations will need to be formulated separately.

However, the public in Meili was quite indignant, and there was a market strike to express their dissatisfaction. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Anti-Japanese Resistance and Port Blockade</h3>
<p>As the Japanese Empire contemplates withdrawing from the League of Nations, it suddenly issued an opinion on the so-called blockade issue in the form of a statement by a responsible person. The statement said that countries around the world will not blockade Japan because Japan withdraws from the League of Nations. If Japan is indeed subjected to a blockade, the Japanese navy can immediately blockade Chinese ports, cutting off all countries' trade with China. At the same time, Japan can enforce trade to maintain its economy during extraordinary times. We have repeatedly stated the incompetence of the League of Nations. We have also determined that its so-called economic sanctions are merely a tool for deceiving people because the great powers will never sacrifice their trade with Japan for the sake of the China issue. Therefore, the statement that "countries around the world will not blockade Japan because Japan withdraws from the League of Nations" can be said to have a clear understanding of the weaknesses of the League of Nations. Looking back at those in our country who advocate compromise, they are still seeking a diplomatic solution in a way that is akin to consulting deities and divination. It can be said that they are foolish and ignorant.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the Japanese navy wants to blockade our country's ports, it would be a very easy task, except for Guangdong and Guangxi. Since Ryukyu and Taiwan have fallen into enemy hands, the Japanese Empire has geographically created a semi-circular encirclement line around China. If the people of the country have time to look at a map of Asia, they will know that the statement is not false. Under this kind of natural situation, the Japanese only need to use the activity of submarines to fully implement an effective encirclement. This encirclement starts from Hebei and Shandong in the north and extends to Fujian and Zhejiang in the south. Only the Pearl River basin, due to the presence of British forces, may be able to find shelter and be spared. For more than twenty years, ignorant military men in our country have been indulging in internal warfare. The so-called national defense has long been forgotten. Once a sudden incident occurs, they realize that they have become turtles in a jar. Who is responsible for this? How can we not be heartbroken?</p>
<p>Thirdly, the so-called forced trade has already begun during the January 28th Incident. The areas around Tianjin, Jinan, and Jiaozhou have even become accustomed to it. At that time, the weak local officials, intimidated by the threat of Japanese gunboats, voluntarily prohibited the people from opposing Japan. Unscrupulous merchants even used the meager profits from Japanese goods to exploit the people's hard-earned money. The gains from trade within the country were used to complete the needs of aggression within the country. This was already a fact. Therefore, the so-called maintenance of the economy during extraordinary times has long been in its embryonic form. It would be a big mistake to think of forced trade as forced buying and selling.</p>
<p>From the above, it is obvious that China's resistance against Japan must be an anti-imperialist national revolution. If China cannot abandon the ports, which are in fact the main base for imperialist economic aggression, with the courage of a warrior cutting off his wrist, and sacrifice the immature national capital controlled by imperialist capital forces, then it will definitely not dare to talk about war. And at this time when the lifeline of finance is tied to trade and the concentration of financial power in the ports, it is impossible to talk about war without preparing for a drastic reform of financial policy and the monetary system. Only with such determination and such perseverance can we automatically impose a counter-blockade on the ports, so that the vast inland areas will no longer be the consumer market for the various treaty ports under imperialist forces. Only then can we break the Japanese evil scheme of using Chinese to control Chinese. Only then can we make the conflicts of interest between the great powers intensify rapidly due to the blockage of the Chinese market. However, how can this be hoped for from those in the country who are content with the status quo, indulge in pleasure, and refuse to repent?</p>
<h3>Germany Does Not Forget Former Overseas Territories</h3>
<p>Japan Does Not Abandon Mandated Islands</p>
<p>Causes Extreme Concern in the German Government</p>
<p>(Berlin) The issue of returning Germany's overseas territories has now become an important part of Germany's foreign policy. The National Socialist government attaches great importance to Japan's declaration that even if Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it cannot return the Pacific islands that were previously entrusted to it for administration. Today, official sources said that this issue can only be resolved by the League of Nations Council and the Mandates Commission. If the League of Nations Council and the Mandates Commission can handle this matter, the German government will take a stand to protect all the interests of Germany's territories. (Reuters, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry received a report from its embassy in Germany stating that the German government issued a statement yesterday saying that the issue of the mandate over the South Pacific Islands must be resolved by the League of Nations Council and the Mandates Commission. The German government has decided to assert its demands in these two bodies and will not express anything separately to Japan. Although the Japanese government has withdrawn from the League of Nations, the Mandates Commission has decided to participate. Therefore, after withdrawing from the League of Nations, it will have a more serious conflict with the countries of the League of Nations. The Japanese Foreign Ministry considers this statement an important issue and will carefully study how to deal with it. (China United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The German government has officially declared its attitude on the issue of the South Pacific Mandate. The Japanese naval authorities are very nervous about this. They are awaiting a public announcement from the Japanese military attaché in Germany. The South Pacific Mandate is Japan's maritime lifeline. The "Withdrawal from the League of Nations and the South Pacific Mandate" issued by the Naval Military Education Department today contains the following views: (1) The South Pacific Islands were occupied by the Japanese Navy after participating in World War I. During World War I, it was agreed between Japan and the United Kingdom that Japan would acquire the territories after the end of World War I. (2) However, as a result of participating in the war, the United States obtained the right to speak at the peace conference and opposed the annexation of Germany's colonies. Therefore, the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Japan abandoned the name and took the reality, assigning the territories to Japan under the name of administering them on behalf of the League of Nations. (3) However, this assignment was decided before the establishment of the League of Nations, and the South Pacific Islands were not mandated by the League of Nations. Therefore, the League of Nations has no right to change the mandatory power. (4) In short, the so-called League of Nations mandate means that sovereignty does not lie with the League of Nations but with Japan. Therefore, even if it withdraws, there is no need to give up. (Dentsu, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is expected that if Japan formally notifies its withdrawal from the League of Nations and still declares its desire to retain the mandated islands in the Pacific, the Allied Powers may convene a meeting to discuss the matter. Recent statements by Japan and Germany on the issue of the disposition of these islands have caused great concern here. It is expected that this will become a thorny crisis. Furthermore, it is heard that Washington has already notified the League of Nations that if Japan attempts to retain the islands after leaving the League of Nations, the United States will be extremely concerned. Legal experts agree that the former German colonies nominally still belong to the Allied Powers, and the League of Nations is only acting as a custodian. (National Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Japan's desire to continue to hold the governing islands in the Pacific after its withdrawal from the League of Nations has now become a major topic of discussion at the League of Nations. These islands belonged to Germany before the European War. Therefore, both the League of Nations and Germany feel a very keen interest in this issue, and they both feel that this matter cannot be resolved solely by Japan. It must be handled jointly by various countries through international treaties. The principles of the League of Nations' governing methods will inevitably be affected as a result. Therefore, Germany will also be able to have the opportunity to state its views when this issue is brought up for discussion in the future. (National Telegraph, 22nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, reliable sources here reported that after Japan formally notifies its withdrawal from the League of Nations, the German government will request the return of the Pacific islands administered by Japan when the League of Nations Mandates Commission meets to discuss the issue. However, according to sources close to the Hitler government, Germany does not want to beg for help from the League of Nations. It would rather the League of Nations launch it on its own. At present, the whole of Germany is paying very close attention to the fate of these islands. Today's Kolnische Zeitung editorial stated that the Japanese government's declaration that it still wants to retain the Pacific mandated islands has raised an extremely serious issue. This matter concerns principles, so it is of great importance to Germany. This is a basic issue concerning the mandate system and falls within the jurisdiction of the League of Nations. It cannot be considered solely from Japan's perspective. (National Telegraph, 23rd)</p>
<h3>Saito Determined to Find an Opportunity to Step Down</h3>
<p>Cabinet Change Within Seven Months</p>
<p>Urging Finance Minister to Maintain the Status Quo</p>
<p>Various Political Parties Actively Mobilizing</p>
<p>National League Advocates Hiranuma Cabinet</p>
<p>Minzheng Party Supports Ugaki Kazushige</p>
<p>Kinno-to Demands Imperial Relative to Take Power</p>
<p>(Tokyo) With only two days left before the close of the Japanese Diet, political circles are focusing on the issue of the successor cabinet. Prime Minister Saito met with Home Minister Yamamoto again in the Diet this morning at 11:00 AM, and they reached a consensus on the issue of stepping down. They are only waiting for an opportunity to step down after the end of the Diet. As for the issue of the successor cabinet, the claims of the various factions are unusually divergent. The Seiyukai advocates that President Suzuki should form a strong party cabinet and may cooperate with friendly parties. The Minzheng Party advocates that Saito should reorganize the cabinet and continue to rule, otherwise hand it over to Korean Governor Ugaki to organize a military cabinet based on the Minzheng Party. The National League advocates the establishment of the Hiranuma Cabinet and close cooperation with the military. What is most noteworthy is the fascist party's advocacy of an imperial relative cabinet, implementing a "Kinno-to Revolution" and using the authority of the imperial family to silence the opposition. All opponents will be charged with treason. They plan to eliminate dissenters. According to Kinno-to, in October 1931, after the September 18th Incident, they supported a certain imperial relative to carry out the Kinno-to Revolution, but failed in advance. This time, they are taking the opportunity to be active again, using young military men as a background. On the surface, it is presided over by anarchist Endo Musui. What will the future of Japanese politics be? Before the establishment of the new cabinet, there is indeed a lot of excitement. (China United Press, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the meeting between Prime Minister Saito and Finance Minister Takahashi, the current cabinet will indeed resign at an appropriate time, probably after the end of the Diet, the completion of the budget implementation procedures, the aftermath of the Jehol issue, and the conclusion of the withdrawal from the League of Nations. The deadline must be in July. During the meeting with the Finance Minister yesterday, the Prime Minister stated his hope that he would temporarily restrain himself before July, and the Finance Minister seemed to have understood. (Dentsu, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito held a meeting with Home Minister Yamamoto, the elder of the cabinet, for 20 minutes today. The Prime Minister explained the political situation and other issues, and asked the Home Minister's opinion on the issue of the cabinet's advance and retreat. The Home Minister said that the current situation is serious, so do not act rashly. The issue of advance and retreat should be taken in the same action as the other cabinet members. Prime Minister Saito plans to visit Saionji within days, convey the Home Minister's opinion, and request understanding. (Nichi-Ren, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to observations in Japanese political circles, the elder statesmen hold a pessimistic attitude towards the future of the Saito cabinet. The reasons are roughly as follows: (1) Since Saito took office, he has indeed made considerable achievements in rescuing the emergency situation, but his facilities lack a consistent strategy. (2) The financial and economic policies do not have a long-term plan, but only make up for the current needs. The future is truly worrying. (3) Foreign Minister Uchida only stated Japan's position to European and American countries and has no constructive strategy. At a time when the situation in the Far East is becoming increasingly tense, appropriate diplomatic skills should be used to save the current isolated situation. In the future, we should actively carry out constructive diplomacy to save Japan's crisis. Based on the above reasons, the elder statesmen may not offer any consolation on the issue of Saito's resignation. However, these observations are only prevalent in the Seiyukai and the military. Other attitudes are not yet clear. (China United Press, 23rd)</p>

<p>Disregarding League of Nations Advice</p>
<h3>Peru Takes Active Military Action</h3>
<p>Placing Mines in Upper Amazon</p>
<p>Fleet Moves Directly to Colombian Coast</p>
<p>国民二十二日巴拉电 [巴拉 may be incorrect, unreadable here] According to a telegram from Bara on the 22nd, Peru recently had news that it would still use force to resolve the dispute over the Leticia port, disregarding the League of Nations. Today, Brazilian merchant ships returning from the upper reaches of the Amazon River claimed that Peru had placed mines near the Leticia port in the upper reaches of the Amazon River to prevent the Colombian fleet from approaching. The ship hired a Peruvian pilot to be able to pass through the mine area. It also said that Peru's mine-laying design was quite ingenious, and it could completely control the river channel electrically from the shore, making the Colombian warships practically worthless. Furthermore, according to news from the Leticia region, Peru will launch a land and air attack on the Colombian army in the area in a few days and threaten the Pacific coast of Colombia with its main fleet. Today's telegram from the capital of Ecuador seems to confirm this news. It is said that the Ecuadorian government received official telegrams from the two coastal ports that a large Peruvian fleet was traveling at full speed towards the Colombian coast. According to the Colombian Pacific coast, there are no important seaports, but it is expected that the Peruvian warships will not go beyond the Panama Canal into the Caribbean Sea to attack Colombia's main commercial ports.</p>
<p>France Raises Many Objections</p>
<h3>Progress on Four-Power Cooperation Slow</h3>
<h3>French Premier to Visit Rome</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 22nd According to Reuters in Paris on the 22nd, French Prime Minister Daladier may visit Italy within days to meet with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini to discuss the understanding of the four countries of Britain, France, Italy, and Germany. However, France has now raised many objections to this matter, which has slowed down progress. France believes that the trend of four-power understanding is sufficient to divide European countries into camps and damage the characteristics of the League of Nations. Member states of the League of Nations enjoy equal rights in the League of Nations.</p>
<p>Havas, Paris, 23rd According to Havas in Paris on the 23rd, when the British and French prime ministers and the diplomatic authorities of the two countries discussed the establishment of a cooperation method for the four major European powers yesterday, it was heard that French Prime Minister Daladier and French Foreign Minister Pongu had raised the following points, saying that they should be considered: (1) If the European Peace Agreement is only participated in by four strong countries, it is feared that it will divide European countries into two factions. (2) According to the League of Nations organization, all countries are equal in the meeting. If the Italian phase's new plan is followed, it is feared that the authority of the League of Nations will be harmed, as the status of the countries will be different. (3) Treaty revision is recognized by the new plan, but the possible impact of treaty revision in practice and the legal conditions for its implementation must be estimated in advance, and the countries of the Little Entente and Poland should have the right to express their opinions before the countries that advocate treaty revision. (4) If Germany is given equal treatment, what security guarantees will be given to France to reconcile? The British cabinet members all acknowledged that this plan should first be strictly studied by the French government, and the prime ministers of Britain and France plan to exchange views at length again within days.</p>

<p>Due to Strong Opposition from Small Countries</p>
<h3>Military Disarmament Conference Will Not Extend</h3>
<p>British Plan to be Proposed for Discussion Today</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 23rd - The Geneva Military Disarmament Conference decided today not to adjourn the Military Disarmament Conference before Easter. It also voted in favor of resuming discussions on the British plan tomorrow. Today, smaller countries strongly opposed the proposal of the four major powers to adjourn the meeting, as they did not want the Rome talks to interfere with the work of the Military Disarmament Conference.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 22nd - The declaration on the extension of the Military Disarmament Conference, jointly drafted by the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, British Prime Minister MacDonald, and Foreign Secretary Simon, has greatly shocked people here. Some even regard this declaration as the first move by the four major European powers to interfere. Many secondary state delegations clearly stated that this matter had created a negative impression on their respective governments, and they accused the British of wanting to use the Rome and Paris talks as an excuse to extend the Disarmament Conference. It is reported that after the five major powers reached a compromise on the issue of equality of armaments last December, the General Committee did not consider it appropriate for a small number of countries to privately negotiate outside the Disarmament Conference. Yesterday's announcement by Henderson and others of the adjournment news has once again led people to suspect that the major powers will privately negotiate. Some say that Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu intends to express his views on behalf of the Little Entente countries, and Polish representative Raczkiewicz will also raise a protest again. Henderson is well aware of this sentiment, so his attitude tomorrow will be more reserved and not as straightforward as yesterday's announcement. It is likely that the adjournment will be requested by the British or Italian delegation, and Henderson will not advocate it himself. France will take a wait-and-see attitude. If the adjournment is indeed decided, the French representative will request restrictions on the length of the adjournment and that the specialized committees continue their work. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu will soon go to Paris to state his views on behalf of the Little Entente countries.</p>
<p>Reuters, Athens, 22nd - The draft of the disarmament plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald was approved today by a joint meeting of the Greek Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Naval Minister, and Army Minister.</p>

<h3>Limiting China's Air Force</h3>
<p>Only Allowed 100 Aircraft</p>
<p>Government Determined to Argue on Principle</p>
<p>(Nanjing) - The World Disarmament Conference limits us to 100 aircraft. Our representative attending the Disarmament Conference has already reported this. The government has ordered a vigorous argument, the reason being that China's long-distance national defense must be at least equal to the number of defense aircraft of the major powers. It is heard that France has a total of 4,500 defense aircraft. Although the UK, Germany, and Italy have proposed a limit of 500 aircraft, it will certainly not be supported by France.

<p>Amidst the Voices of German-Austrian Union</p>
<h3>Calls for the Restoration of the German Monarchy Rise Again</h3>
<h3>Hitler's Dictatorship Seems Inevitable</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 22nd - The Standing Committee of the Reichstag met today. Reichstag National Socialist Party member Dr. Kubek spoke amidst cheers, expressing the National Socialist Party's ambition to unite Germany and Austria into one great nation. One member of the German National People's Party stated that he hoped that the Hohenzollern royal family would one day resume ruling Germany, which was also met with applause. Reuters, Berlin, 23rd - A gathering was held somewhere in Berlin last night to celebrate the birthday of German Emperor Wilhelm I. A certain important figure gave a speech stating that the restoration of the German monarchy, like day following night, is a natural and inevitable event. Many princes and former generals of the old dynasty attended the meeting that night. One speaker stated that our efforts will not cease until the imperial flag is once again flying over the Kaiser Palace in Berlin, which was met with cheers of "Long Live the Kaiser" by the crowd.</p>
<h3>Government Announces Major Policies</h3>
<p>National News, Berlin, 23rd - The Reichstag will reconvene at noon today to hear the Prime Minister announce major policies. The Reichstag will then discuss granting emergency powers to the government. It is expected that the bill will be passed by the required two-thirds majority according to the constitution, as the Bavarian People's Party and the Center Party will both vote in favor. The Social Democratic Party will likely abstain from voting. The Prime Minister's speech will reiterate Germany's sincere desire for genuine peace, and it is expected that there will be some startling remarks. His speech will be broadcast nationwide.</p>
<h3>German-Russian Relations Will Still Be Maintained</h3>
<p>National News, Berlin, 22nd - According to a telegram from Cabinet Minister Goering to a special correspondent for the newspaper, the German government's elimination of German communism will not affect German-Russian relations. What the Soviet Union does is not related to Germany, and what Germany does is not related to the Soviet Union. Therefore, relations between the two countries will remain friendly as before. The correspondent asked what the German government would do about the recent disturbances of Jewish shops and other atrocities by the National Socialist Party youth, which have been condemned by countries around the world as an abuse of power. Goering replied that he had recently expelled fifteen National Socialist Party members who had violated discipline. He dared to assert that such incidents would not happen again. It should be known that Germany has undergone a revolution in the past few weeks and has succeeded with very little bloodshed, which is truly something to be proud of. Goering concluded by saying that as Minister of Aviation, he intends to consolidate Germany's air defenses within the existing limits, with the aim of making Germany a flying nation.</p>
<p>U.S. President Approves</p>
<h3>Beer Legalization Bill</h3>
<p>Effective from April 7th</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 22nd - U.S. President Roosevelt today approved the beer bill, allowing the sale of beer, light wine, and fruit juice residue, but the alcohol content of various beverages may not exceed 3.2 percent. This new law is effective from April 7th. Thus, the U.S. alcohol ban has been lifted by half. However, the complete and formal repeal of the alcohol ban requires a constitutional amendment agreed to by two-thirds of the states.</p>
<h3>German-Czech Ill Feelings Resolved</h3>
<p>Cause Arises from Suspension of Commercial Debt</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 22nd - Recently, there have been ill feelings between Germany and Czechoslovakia. Both sides have now begun to work towards a solution. The Czech government has notified the Berlin government that it is willing to begin negotiations to remove all obstacles to improving relations between the two countries. The German government has also agreed. This matter occurred a week ago when the Czech government suddenly ordered the Czech people not to pay any commercial debts to Germany. Therefore, as retaliation, the German side also adopted the same measures, suspending all commercial payments.</p>

<h3>Arrested British Nationals Granted Bail</h3>
<p>Still Fails to Satisfy the British Government</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 23rd - The Russian Ambassador to Britain declared that the Soviet prosecutor had granted bail today to three engineers of the Vickers Electrical Company who were detained on the 12th of this month for negligence. One bail was 20,000 rubles, and the other two were 15,000 rubles, but MacDonald, who was arrested at the same time, was not mentioned. This decision by the Soviet Union has failed to satisfy the British government, as the British government believes that the Soviet Union fabricated this case for other purposes in order to entrap innocent people. Reuters has learned that if a satisfactory agreement cannot be reached, the British government may prohibit the import of Russian goods when the Anglo-Russian trade agreement expires on April 17th.</p>
<h3>Increased Surtax on Chinese Goods Imported into France</h3>
<p>National News, Paris, 23rd - Today, the French government announced an order increasing the additional tariff on currency devaluation for goods from China and Japan from 15 percent to 25 percent, effective immediately. It also increased this surtax by 15 percent on goods from South Africa, New Zealand, Ceylon, and the Malayan Federation.</p>
<h3>Introducing Several Japanese Naval Giants</h3>
<p>Former Naval Minister Okada Keisuke is the leader of the Fukui Navy. On January 6th, he suddenly expressed his intention to resign, and as a result, Osumi Mineo was elected to succeed him. Osumi had previously served as a senior adjutant during Saito's tenure as Naval Minister and had also served as Vice-Minister under Okada's Naval Ministership during the Tanaka Cabinet. He was originally from the Seiyukai. If Osumi were to replace Okada in the Saito Cabinet, it would naturally be appropriate in terms of the Seiyukai.</p>
<p>After Okada's resignation, among the Japanese naval generals during this extraordinary period, apart from Marshal Togo of the Marshal's Office and the current Chief of Naval General Staff, Prince Fushimi Hiroyasu, Kano Kanji of the Fukui Navy is the most senior, followed by Ambo Kiyotane, Taniguchi Naomasa, Yamamoto Eisuke, and Osumi.</p>
<p>In Kasumigaseki (place name), the towering buildings are the gathering place of the Naval Ministry and the Naval General Staff, which control naval administration and military operations. Among them are 8,200 officers, 88,000 soldiers, more than 280 ships, and 800 aircraft. Now, let's introduce a few people.</p>
<p>Among the people who are considered to be naval leaders, the first thing to pay attention to is that the class of students who volunteered to enter the naval academy during the two Sino-Japanese and Russo-Japanese Wars included the largest number of naval figures in Japan.</p>
<p>This class of people graduated from the Naval Academy in the first term of Meiji 11, and especially focused on the 21st and 22nd terms of naval officers.</p>
<p>During the Donghak Party incident in Korea, Japan declared war on our country on August 1st, Meiji 27. Two months later, the current Naval Minister Osumi, of the 21st term, entered the military academy. After another two months, the 22nd term, in which Yamanashi Katsunoshin studied, was also recruited.</p>
<p>In Osumi's class, the most outstanding student was Tsukushi Jiro, who was promoted to Rear Admiral and then resigned. The second place was Military Councillor Yamamoto Eisuke, and the third place was Osumi. Therefore, the person who is most likely to become Naval Minister in the future should be Yamamoto. Besides Togo, Yamamoto is the leader of the Satsuma Navy, and his father is a brother of Yamamoto Gonnohyoe.</p>
<p>His uncle, Count Yamamoto, held the highest authority in the past Navy for a long time, and his son-in-law, Zaibe, also held the reins of the Navy for a long time. However, he was able to reach his current position entirely on his own ability and did not receive any favors from Count Yamamoto. It is rumored that the Saito Cabinet's prospects will end in May. The press has been touting Yamanashi and Kobayashi as the next Naval Minister. In today's situation, he is being promoted as a candidate for Chief of Naval General Staff. Second only to that, he should be considered the most likely to step forward.</p>
<p>Next, the candidate for Naval Minister is Military Councillor Yamanashi. Yamanashi was Vice-Minister of the Navy at the London Conference, opposing the activists Kato and Suetsugu of the Naval General Staff. He has considerable political skills. He was born in Sendai.</p>
<p>In addition to Yamamoto and Yamanashi, there is also Nomura Kichisaburo, the Commander of Yokosuka Naval District, who acts alone (i.e., the one who was injured by a Korean patriot after the Shanghai Incident), and Kobayashi Seizo, the Commander of the First Fleet. Both of these people will be promoted to Admiral this April.</p>
<p>Nomura and Kobayashi are different. The former has not been to the navy, but both of them are seen as naval experts in the current extraordinary era and are trusted figures of the deceased Kato Tomosaburo. Nomura served as Kato's senior adjutant and was also a member of Kato's entourage at the Washington Conference. The two were often inseparable. On the other hand, Kobayashi is Kato's nephew, so they naturally have the possibility of succeeding as ministers or chiefs. Strangely enough, the positions that these two held four or five years ago were the same, and they both maintained a mutually antagonistic position, but Nomura lost one eye, which will somewhat affect his future career. Compared to Kobayashi's career, he will inevitably be slightly inferior.</p>
<p>Next, we should mention Nakamura Ryuzo. Nakamura entered the military academy with the first place and graduated with the first place. He is indeed a candidate for Chief of Naval General Staff, but Suetsugu, who graduated in the same term as him, is the new leader of the entire navy and is also a candidate for Chief of Naval General Staff. This is Nakamura's formidable opponent.</p>
<p>Suetsugu, who suddenly became famous at the same time as the London Conference, certainly has the possibility of succeeding as the next Chief of Naval General Staff. The reason why he jumped to national fame was because he was active during the London Conference as Vice-Chief of Naval General Staff. At that time, the activities of the Naval General Staff, Chief Kato, were nothing more than decorations. In fact, it can be said that Suetsugu did everything. Perhaps Suetsugu can be promoted to Admiral at the same time as Nakamura at the end of April this year.</p>
<p>After Suetsugu, the leading figures are Nagano Osami of the 25th term and Sakonji Seizo, Commander of Sasebo Naval District.</p>
<p>Nagano was born in Tosa and has the potential to become a minister or chief. He is no less than Kobayashi, Suetsugu, and Nakamura. He served as a military attache in the United States for a long time and is an expert on the United States. Although he may become a minister, Chief of Naval General Staff is more suitable.</p>
<p>Sakonji's original hometown is Yonezawa, and his biological father is a lawyer living in Osaka, so he is a pure Osaka child. During his time as Commander of the Torpedo Squadron, he strongly criticized the tactics of the Naval General Staff Central, so the self-confidence of Nagano and Sakonji will soon become an important role in the Japanese Navy.</p>
<h3>Situation at Gubeikou and Xifengkou Slightly Eases</h3>
<p>Song Zheyuan in Ping Talks About the Combat Process</p>
<p>Enemies Harassing in Pingjin, Shandong, Chahar, and Suiyuan</p>
<p>Chiang Has Major Determination to Actively Resist the Enemy</p>
<p>Special Telegram from Peiping: Since the fall of Chengde, our army has fought bravely at Gubeikou and Xifengkou, leaving a page of glorious war history. At Gubeikou, the three divisions of the Northeast Army, Zhang Tingxu, He Lizhong, and Zhang Zhengfang, were originally deployed to resist the enemy, covering from Miyun and Shunyi in the south to Qingshiliang in the north, along the Great Wall. Starting on the 6th of this month, the Japanese Suzuki Brigade, in conjunction with puppet troops, launched a large-scale attack, engaging our army in fierce fighting in the Qingshiliang and Changshanyu areas. Our army fought bravely, repeatedly blunting the enemy's advance, and the enemy was unable to succeed. They then changed their strategy, sending more than 40 aircraft to Gubeikou to drop bombs, threatening our rear, while adopting flanking tactics, harassing our right flank. After several days and nights of fierce fighting, the Japanese and puppet troops suffered heavy casualties. Afterwards, the Central Army's Guan Linzheng and Huang Jie divisions went to the front line to take over the defense, and the Northeast Army gradually withdrew for rest. Unexpectedly, while our army was rotating troops, the Japanese army took the opportunity to launch a fierce attack. The Central Army came into contact with the Japanese army as soon as they arrived at the position. Since the 10th, there have been several bloody battles, with heavy casualties on both sides. Our army eventually abandoned the area outside the pass due to the sharpness of the enemy's aircraft, artillery, and tanks, and built a new position in the Nantianmen area to hold firmly to the dangerous terrain. Since the 12th, this area has entered a state of truce. At Xifengkou, the Japanese Hattori and Suzuki Brigades were severely damaged by Song Zheyuan's troops. Currently, the enemy on the Xifengkou front does not dare to face us directly. In addition to sending aircraft to our rear for reconnaissance and bombing every day, they are transferring Japanese troops and Mongolian puppet troops from Chengde and Luanping to reinforce, changing their strategy to attack Luowenyu, hoping to invade Zunhua's rear through that route. Song's troops stationed at Luowenyu also defeated the enemy, killing more than 1,000 people. On the 18th, our army circled around the enemy's rear, attacking their flanks, and the enemy was unable to support themselves, collapsing and retreating more than ten miles. Last night (19th), there was no fighting in the front. In total, at Xifengkou, from the 9th to the 19th, there were bloody battles for ten days, with more than a dozen battles of various sizes. More than 4,000 enemies were killed with broadswords, and the number killed by guns and cannons is still unknown. More than 3,000 of our soldiers also died for their country. As of today, the anti-Japanese battles at the Great Wall passes have temporarily come to a small end. Our army's defenses are also being reorganized. Two units were sent to reinforce Song's troops. At Gubeikou, troops from the He Zhuguo unit, which was responsible for the Shihu front line, were transferred to the rear, and troops from nearby were deployed to fill the gap. Commander Chiang has recently met separately with Generals Song, Han, Pang, and Wan. A new plan has been determined for the anti-Japanese military, and preparations are currently underway.</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan, who killed the enemy and defended against insults at Xifengkou, was summoned to Ping the night before last to meet with He Yingqin, and then went to Baoding to visit Chiang. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, he returned to Ping from Baoding. Today (20th) at 1:00 PM, he met with reporters from various newspapers at his office to report on the combat process and his meeting with Chiang. His remarks were as follows: "It is truly heartbreaking that our civilized country with 400 million people is being controlled by Japan, a small island with only tens of millions of people. This time, our country is using force against Japan because we have no other choice. Japan is determined to pursue an aggressive policy, gradually encroaching on our territory. Since the September 18th Incident, they have taken an inch and advanced a foot, their fierce flames have grown stronger, occupying the three northeastern provinces and then occupying Jinzhou and threatening Rehe. Our country can no longer tolerate it and can no longer concede, so we mobilized our troops for legitimate defense. The officers and soldiers of the various armies have all embraced the determination to resist Japan and are willing to fight the Japanese army. In peacetime, it is difficult to mobilize troops. This time, the orders arrived and they all rushed to the front line, which shows that the hearts of the people are not dead and there is something to be done to save the country. The failure of this initial Sino-Japanese war was due to the enemy's delaying tactics. After the Yuguan Incident, our army's morale should have been used in a timely manner to fight the enemy. However, because the Japanese vigorously publicized that they would not advance any further, the people were too complacent and fell into their trap. The military deployment for Rehe was delayed, which allowed the Japanese army to take advantage of the situation and enter, and Chengde was lost in less than ten days. Therefore, the failure of this Rehe war was not a defeat, but rather due to slow military deployment. On August 7th of last year, I sent a letter to Mr. Zhang Hanqing with some suggestions, asking him to prepare in time to prevent the Japanese army from invading Rehe, advocating that 50,000 people enter Rehe to garrison the Pingquan Sanjiazi area, 30,000 people guard Yuguan, and another 50,000 people serve as a reserve force in the rear. Pingquan Sanjiazi is the military center. If preparations had been made early here, even if the Japanese army came with 100,000 troops, it would probably not have been easy to cross the boundary by even a step. Even if it were not possible, it would not have been difficult to hold for a month or half a month. Unfortunately, it was not adopted at the time, and it was not until the Japanese pirates had already entered that we began to dig a well when we were already thirsty, so that the enemy's attack could not be prevented. After the Japanese army invaded Chengde, they planned to capture Xifengkou and attack Pingjin. The Japanese Hattori and Suzuki Brigades, in conjunction with Mongolian puppet troops, were ordered to occupy Xifengkou within two days. Unexpectedly, they were repelled by our army on the first day. I often say to my subordinates that we may be able to protect the country by fighting to the death. We take protecting the people as our slogan. If we cannot fight to the death and allow our compatriots to become slaves of a conquered nation, can we call it protecting the people? Some people say that those who fight on the front line are sacrifices, and those in the rear are successes. We prefer to be sacrifices and do not want to be successes. My officers and soldiers all embrace the determination to die. Although the enemy's guns and cannons are sharp, they are also useless. Since the 9th, when we came into contact with the enemy, we have repeatedly blunted the enemy's advance. The enemy could not succeed in attacking the front, so they circled around and attacked Dongjiakou on our right flank, and were severely beaten by us. Corpses were scattered all over the field. According to eyewitness accounts from the wounded soldiers, the enemy transported the corpses back in cars, with a total of 106 cars carrying six corpses each. The large number of people killed can be imagined. In the battle of Laopo Mountain, our army cut down about 600 enemy soldiers. We circled around and attacked the enemy's artillery positions, and cut down another 700 people. The enemy's infantry and cavalry units were completely wiped out. In total, after more than a dozen fierce battles of various sizes, the enemy army suffered between 3,000 and 5,000 casualties. After the fighting at Gubeikou stopped, the Japanese army concentrated its forces to attack and attack Luowenyu, intending to attack Zunhua from there and threaten the rear of Xifengkou. The enemy scouted that our troops stationed there only had one battalion, so they transferred more than 2,000 people from the 31st and 8th Regiments in Luanping, as well as more than 30 Mongolian and Korean puppet troops, and secretly attacked. Fortunately, we obtained a letter from a Japanese soldier to the captain of the 31st Regiment, peeking into their conspiracy, and quickly transferred two brigades to reinforce the defense and prepare early. Therefore, the enemy's attacks were repelled. Afterwards, the enemy again transferred reinforcements to attack, and there was hand-to-hand combat for two or three days and nights, killing many enemies. Our army also suffered considerable losses. On the night of the 18th, our army circled around and attacked the enemy's rear, and the enemy was unable to support themselves, collapsing and retreating more than ten miles. Yesterday afternoon, there was no more fighting. It is estimated that more than 1,000 people were killed and their vitality was greatly damaged. The Japanese army reported to its own country that the Japanese army's defeat in the Xifengkou area was unprecedented since the Meiji Restoration. In total, the fighting started on the 9th and lasted for ten days until yesterday (19th), and the fighting has come to a small end. The Japanese army has set up an airfield in Pingquan with about 50 to 60 aircraft to bomb our army's positions, but the effect is very small. After the war, only more than 100 of our officers and soldiers were killed or wounded by aircraft bombing. Last night at 5:00 PM, the Japanese army sent another seven aircraft to drop bombs in Zunhua City, dropping a total of more than 30 bombs, injuring only nine civilians and two soldiers. Now, our reinforcements have arrived, and with the current military strength, the enemy will definitely not be able to succeed in the Xifengkou area. However, their ambitions have not died, and they will definitely think of other ways to retaliate. Therefore, I believe that the war is still just beginning and cannot be relaxed for a day. On the bodies of Japanese artillery officers killed in action, our army found maps and plans to invade our country, not only to harass Pingjin, but also to conspire to occupy Shandong and Chahar. At this time, if we cannot use force to stop their advance and curb their ambitions, the Japanese army's ambitions will not end, and they will inevitably invade North China. The people of the country should embrace the determination to resist Japan. This time, I went to Baoding to meet with Commander Chiang to report on the situation at the front and ask for instructions. Commander Chiang has a major determination and is bound to have special plans, first to stabilize his foothold and then to advance. Citizens who die for killing the enemy, though dead, are still alive. I originally planned to return to the defense last night, but because the enemy had retreated, it was temporarily cancelled. I plan to return to the defense after discussing military matters with Minister He." (20th)</p>
<h3>Northeast Volunteer Army Rises Up</h3>
<p>Sitao Road is Demolished by the Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Volunteer Army in the Five Stations Area is Especially Active</p>
<p>Manchurian Defense is Empty, Japan is Unable to Manage it All</p>
<p>United States News Agency, Changchun, 17th - Volunteer armies in various places in Manchuria have risen up this month. Although the news is strictly censored, it is still sporadically spreading. When the Japanese troops from various places were dispatched to participate in the Battle of Rehe, the volunteer armies took the opportunity to rise up. Today (17th) at dawn, a team of volunteer army destroyed two trains on the Sitao Road, killing dozens of Japanese and Manchus, and injuring more than a hundred. The details are unknown, but according to people in the railway industry, the volunteer army demolished the railway near Ningyuan at 1:30 AM this morning. Shortly after, a train derailed at that place. Before anything could be done, the second train arrived and collided with the first train, causing numerous deaths and injuries. There are also reports of volunteer armies rising up in various places in eastern Manchuria, especially in the Five Stations area. Currently, most of the Japanese troops continue to fight in the Great Wall area, resulting in an empty defense in Manchuria. It is expected that Japan may still send troops to Manchuria. There are currently about 50,000 Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria. Many foreigners believe that Manchuria is vast, and that the Japanese will need at least 100,000 troops to maintain order there.</p>
<p>Fu Zuoyi's Troops</p>
<h3>Deployed in Dolon</h3>
<p>After Fu Consulted in Ping and Baoding, He Returned to Suiyuan and Will Take Full Responsibility for the Coming Attack and Defense</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence, Fu Zuoyi, Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, recently went to Baoding to meet with Commander Chiang to ask for instructions, and after returning to Ping, he has been in consultations with He Yingqin for several days. Now that everything is done, today (20th), he is taking a car back to Zhangjiakou with Secretary-General Zeng Chunfu and more than a dozen attendants. Before leaving, Fu made the following remarks to reporters at the station: "I had to make a small stay in Beiping and Baoding because I had to ask Commander Chiang for important national defense matters. Because defense is important, I must return to the defense immediately. It is the duty of a soldier to defend against insults and defend the land, so I must work hard and take full responsibility. The open army is currently in Dolon, and the defense is extremely solid. The area is commonly known as Lama Temple, located in the upper reaches of the Wan River, where the four reaches of Inner and Outer Mongolia meet, and it was opened as a commercial port in the third year of the Republic of China. The prosperity of the business is comparable to that of Zhangjiakou, and it is a large metropolis in southern Mongolia," and so on. (20th)</p>
<p>He Chengjun Stationed in Ping</p>
<h3>Assisting in the Anti-Japanese Military Effort</h3>
<p>The Xi'an Executive Office Temporarily Abolished</p>
<p>To Immediately Transfer to Hankou to Suppress Bandits in Jiangxi</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, the Pacification Director stationed in Hubei, who was recently stationed in Xi'an to oversee the suppression of the bandit Xu, once expressed his intention to shift his troops to resist foreign aggression after the remaining bandits were eliminated. Recently, Bazhong and Nanjiang were successively recovered by Tian Songyao's forces, and the remaining bandits are expected to be eradicated. He was summoned by telegram by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to consult on all matters. Consequently, on the 16th, he departed from Xi'an for Tongguan, passed through Zhengzhou on the 17th, and arrived in Baoding on the 18th to meet with Chiang. He learned that Chiang had specially ordered He to be stationed in Peiping to assist in the major plan of resisting Japan. The Xi'an Executive Office was temporarily abolished. After receiving the order, He took a train to Peiping from Baoding on the 21st. He dispatched Senior Staff Officer Xu Chengxi to inspect the Xifengkou area, and telegraphed Chief of Staff Zhu Chuanjing to lead the personnel of the Xi'an Executive Office back to Hankou. All bandit suppression military affairs were handed over to Yang Hucheng, the Pacification Director stationed in Shaanxi, and Tian Songyao, the Bandit Suppression Supervisor of the Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Region, for their responsibility. As the national crisis is severe, the generals under He's leadership stationed in Hubei, such as Xu Yuanquan, Wei Lihuang, Qian Dajun, Xiao Zhichu, and Zhang Zhenhan, are all vying to request Chairman Chiang Kai-shek for permission to fight the enemy. It is reported that a certain division has been ordered to depart, and a military station has been established to facilitate transportation. [Unintelligible] is appointed as the general supervisor, and [Unintelligible] is appointed as the deputy supervisor. [Unintelligible] are respectively appointed as the heads of the accounting and logistics departments. A total of fifteen vehicles have been allocated along the Xianghua, Hankou, and Yichang roads, awaiting requisition. Although Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is in the north, presiding over the anti-Japanese military affairs, he is also extremely concerned about the bandit suppression in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces, and has entrusted the authority of the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the three provinces to Liu Zhi, the Pacification Director stationed in Henan, to act as his agent. It is reported that Liu will arrive in Hankou within days, but as the focus of bandit suppression is in Jiangxi, he may not stay in Hankou and will proceed directly to Nanchang to supervise the bandit suppression.

<p>Han Fuqu</p>
<h3>Returning to Jinan After Meeting Chiang in Baoding</h3>
<p>Seeking Instructions on Strategies from Chiang</p>
<p>No Political Matters Were Discussed</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Han Fuqu left Jinan yesterday, passing through Tianjin and Peiping, and arrived in Baoding on the 20th to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. He consulted on many matters regarding the overall situation. That evening, he returned to Peiping and transferred to Tianjin. Today (the 21st) at 9:00 AM, Han, along with Ge Guangting and others, took a special train from Tianjin southward. At 3:00 PM, the train arrived at Sangyuan. He immediately used the telephone to notify the magistrate of Dezhou County and Qiao Lizhi, the commander of the 74th Division, to order military and government personnel and gather the people at the station to await his speech upon arrival in Dezhou. At 4:00 PM, the train arrived in Dezhou. Qiao Lizhi led the division's Chief of Staff Yin Zuxiong, Brigade Commander Ma Guanyi, County Magistrate Li Shude, along with dozens of government officials and officers, and a squad of soldiers, to welcome him at the station. After alighting from the train, Han first reviewed the troops welcoming him at the station, and then summoned Qiao Lizhi and Ma Guanyi onto the train to give instructions. At the same time, he ordered all troops, personnel from various agencies, and civilians stationed in Dezhou to gather at the large parade ground next to the station to listen to his speech. The general idea of his speech was to encourage the military and civilians to act in unison and move towards the path of patriotism. After the speech, the special train continued southward. After passing Yucheng, Jinan had already received a telephone report. Personnel from various Party, government, and military agencies all arrived at the station to welcome him. At 8:55 PM, he arrived in Jinan. Han, along with Ge Guangting, Zhang Liancheng, Yao Yijie, and Zhang Shouqian, all disembarked from the train. Liu Xizhong remained in Peiping. Han then spoke to reporters, briefly saying, "My impression of this trip to Peiping and Baoding is very good. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is determined to strive to resist to the end. In military terms, everything at the front is now arranged by Minister He, which is very tight, with deep trenches and high walls waiting for the enemy. The fighting at Xifengkou was very good, and there was not much fighting at Gubeikou. Although there have been small clashes recently, there have been no major battles. I met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, reported on the military and political situation in this province, and sought instructions on strategies. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek ordered me to hurry back, prepare everything in order, and maintain the public order of this province. Political matters were not discussed. I met with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek once at 8:15 AM yesterday morning, and again after 12:00 PM. After lunch, I left Baoding at 3:00 PM and went to Peiping, to Minister He's place, and had dinner at Chairman Wan's (Fulin) place. After passing through Tianjin, I met with Chairman Yu (Xuezhong). I took a train back from Tianjin again this morning. As for other matters that cannot be disclosed, please forgive me." (March 21st)</p>

<h3>Preparing for the Anti-Japanese Military Effort</h3>
<p>Red Bandits in Tai'ning Retreat Backwards</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Donate Four Aircraft to Fujian</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Red bandits on the border between northern Fujian and eastern Jiangxi have been repeatedly attacked by large Fujian and Jiangxi armies. The total number of remaining bandits is only over 30,000, and they have been divided into two groups: one gathered between Zixi, Lichuan, Guangze, and Tai'ning; and the other gathered between Shicheng, Ruijin, Ninghua, and Changting, constructing defensive works in an attempt to resist stubbornly for a long time. Recently, taking advantage of the concentration of Fujian troops [Unintelligible] preparing to attack [Unintelligible], they transferred troops from the Zixi and Lichuan areas and invaded Guangze and Tai'ning. Therefore, starting on March 15th, fierce battles began with the Jiang Yan Brigade of the Liu Division stationed in Tai'ning and the Zhou Zhiqian Division stationed in Guangze. By the 17th, the bandit forces on the Tai'ning front were unable to withstand the pressure and retreated along the original route to Lichuan. On the Guangze front, the bandit forces were larger, and they held out for many days. On the 19th, troops stationed in Shaowu rushed to their rescue, and the bandits collapsed and retreated. Cai Tingkai, the commander-in-chief of the 19th Route Army, went to Zhangzhou in early this month to command the bandit suppression military affairs in western Fujian. On the 19th, he returned to the province by plane from Zhangzhou with Deng Shizeng, the chief of staff of the Pacification Headquarters. It is reported that they are preparing for the anti-Japanese military effort. The staff office of the Pacification Headquarters summoned reporters from various newspapers in the city for a conversation, generally stating that in this tense situation, the deployment and actions of the troops going north to resist Japan should be reported with caution to avoid leaking secrets. In addition, the training regiment of the 61st Division of the 19th Army stationed in the province and the students of the defense corps cadre training school have been conducting camping and field exercises on the hills outside the northwest gates for days. The security police team of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau and the police trainees of the police training school are also conducting street fighting and night combat exercises in the streets and alleys of the northwest districts of the city at night, which is extremely busy. As for the aircraft donated to the 19th Route Army by overseas Chinese in the Philippines, four have been transported. On the 18th, they flew from Xiamen to the provincial capital and were placed at the Wangzhuang airfield. Yesterday and today, they were piloted by members of the aviation team of the Pacification Headquarters, soaring in the sky for test flights. (March 20th)</p>
<p>Tan Yingzhu, a Prominent Communist Leader, Returns to Hunan to Surrender</p>
<p>Claims to Have Participated in Bandit Suppression Work in Southern Fujian Long Ago</p>
<p>Currently Under Custody of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters Awaiting Disposition</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Before the May 21st Incident, the figures who caused great terror throughout Hunan were the Communist leaders Guo Liang, Xia Xi, Tan Yingzhu, and Yi Lirong. Guo Liang was arrested in Yueyang in 1928, escorted to the provincial capital, and executed. The whereabouts of the others have been unknown for the past five or six years. Among them, Tan Yingzhu, a native of Liuyang, served as the chairman of the General Labor Union before the May 21st Incident, commanding the peasant and worker self-defense army. Xu Kexiang launched the Communist purge in Changsha on May 21st, which was to eliminate the power of Tan and others in Hunan. Due to their defeat, Tan and others fled the province. Cheng Qian, Lu Diping, and He Jian successively presided over the administration of Hunan, all offering a reward of three thousand yuan and issuing public arrest warrants, but they were never apprehended. Last winter, Tan's wife, Huang Yonglan, returned to the province from Shanghai to celebrate her mother's birthday. She was suddenly arrested by the Changsha County Government and presented to the Bandit Suppression Headquarters. She was repeatedly interrogated and ordered to hand over her husband, Tan Yingzhu, but she firmly refused to reveal his whereabouts. The case has been suspended for several months without a resolution. Unexpectedly, at 10:00 AM on the 17th of this month, Tan suddenly went to the Hunan Bandit Suppression Headquarters in person, requested to see He Jian, the concurrent commander, and requested to surrender. At that time, He was not at the headquarters, so Executive Director Li Qiongyan entered and interviewed him. After everything, he was handed over to the special service team for custody, awaiting He Jian's disposition. When all circles heard of this, they were all surprised. According to Tan's confession to Li Qiong, he left the Communist Party in 1927 after escaping from Changsha in May 1927, and did a lot of bandit suppression work in Zhang Zhen's office in Fujian. This time, he came to the province this morning after passing through Shanghai and Hankou from Fujian, and came to the headquarters to surrender, etc. It is still unknown how He will dispose of him. The text of Tan's surrender submission is recorded as follows: "A submission regarding returning to Hunan to surrender and requesting permission to surrender according to law. I, originally named Tan Yingzhu, after the Changsha May 21st Incident occurred and the Kuomintang and Communists split, left the Communist Party, changed my name to Li Jian, registered at the Longxi County Branch of the Chinese Kuomintang in Fujian, and submitted it to the Central Executive Committee, which issued Party Certificate No. Min Zi 02790. I have participated in bandit suppression work in the southern Fujian area. However, at that time, military affairs were rushed, and southern Fujian was located in a remote area. There were no clear regulations on the legal procedures for public surrender, and I had been away from Hunan for a long time, so I was even more estranged from the situation in Hunan. For many years in office, I only knew to be loyal to the Three Principles of the People and to work hard in bandit suppression, and I thought that since I belonged to the Kuomintang, there would be no other problems. In addition, military affairs bound me, and I could not return to Hunan. Unfortunately, after my wife, Huang Yonglan, arrived in Hunan last winter, I was arrested and imprisoned by the Changsha County Government because I had participated in the Communist Party before. When the incident occurred, my wife, Huang Yonglan, was far away thousands of miles away, and it was difficult to arrive in the morning and arrive in the evening. Also, she did not know whether I could collect all the documents of participating in bandit suppression in Fujian over the years, and it was inconvenient to confess the truth due to the circumstances at the time. I have learned of this so far, so I especially ask Zhang Zhen, the commander of the 49th Division of the Army, to prepare a document detailing my years of bandit suppression work in Fujian and send it to your department for verification. I have brought it here after arriving in the province today. I respectfully submit it to your department, and I respectfully request permission to surrender according to law. I respectfully request instructions on how to handle the surrender procedures, so that there will be a follow-up, which will be very helpful. Respectfully submitted to He, Commander of the Hunan Bandit Suppression Headquarters." Attached is the approval order No. Can Zi 12 from the Headquarters of the 49th Division of the Army, a letter No. Can Zi 13, a certificate No. Dang Zi 114 from the Teachers Examination Committee of the Longxi County Party Branch, an instruction No. Can Zi 402 from the Fujian Bandit Suppression Headquarters, an instruction No. Mi Zi 204, an instruction No. Can Zi 336, an official letter from the Temporary First Division of the Army Special Party Office entrusting the Acting Organization Department Director, and an appointment letter from the 49th Division of the Army appointing the leader of the Bandit Suppression Propaganda Brigade.

<h3>Preparing to Dredge the City River</h3>
<p>The city's river channels were dredged ten years ago, resulting in a gradual silting up over the years. Every time the tide recedes, the riverbed is fully exposed, and shallow boats run aground and cannot pass. This greatly affects the transportation of the city's commerce and industry. Residents also rely entirely on river water for their drinking water. During repeated fires, the dry river and shallow water have led to sighs of helplessness. The citizens' hope for dredging is like expecting clouds during a great drought. The county government previously received an order from the province to organize a committee for dredging the river by conscription. The First District Office had previously resolved to prepare for dredging the city river at the district affairs meeting. However, in the past, dredging the river involved levying a storefront donation and hiring laborers to pay according to the amount of earthwork. There were still concerns that it would not be enough. The result of the last dredging was that the government had to subsidize a considerable amount and borrow money from the financial sector to cope, which has not yet been repaid. If the provincial method of conscripting labor is followed, although a substitute fee can be collected, it is feared that the amount collected will be less than half of the storefront donation, making it even more difficult to start. The authorities still need to convene local people to discuss in detail what method to take for dredging the river. The district office has scheduled a meeting, hoping to start construction soon to satisfy the people's expectations.</p>

Zhu Peiyu was also arrested that night and sent to the corps headquarters. After interrogation, it was learned that Zhu had previously served as a drill instructor in the merchant corps. The gun was picked up in Huishan during the Jiazi Year Qilu War and had not been registered. He confirmed that he had lent it to Liu and others for use. Corps Commander Lan ordered Liu and others to be detained for private possession of military weapons and to await investigation.</p>

<h3>Canal Works Bureau Issues Mortgage Bonds</h3>
<p>The Jiangbei Canal Works Bureau, due to the need for a large amount of funds for the crushed stone project on the western embankment of the canal, submitted a request to the Finance and Construction Departments to issue Jiangbei Canal Works mortgage bonds to provide urgent relief.

In counties where the Bureau of Education has been abolished, the county government is responsible for planning and implementing the project.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Province Will Establish Administrative Supervision</h3>
<p>The call for Jiangsu Province to establish a chief county magistrate was very loud last autumn. However, due to the Japanese invasion of Shanghai, it was temporarily shelved and not implemented. It is now learned that the provincial government has re-proposed it and plans to change the name to Administrative Supervision Office, based on the methods of Hubei and Henan provinces. Fifteen supervisors will be appointed throughout the province. Seven supervisors will be appointed first soon. The county magistrate where the office is located will be concurrently served by the supervisor. Some say that the supervisor will not concurrently serve as the county magistrate. The system is like the former Daoyin, but the jurisdiction is smaller and the number of supervisors is larger. As for the candidates for supervisors, it is said that most of them will be borrowed from members of the Control Yuan or current, more capable county magistrates. The date of implementation will not be later than mid-April.</p>

<p>Premier Wang Jingwei, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and the Vice Minister of Railways, Zeng Zhongming, and others, arrived in Shanghai by night train from Nanjing the night before last at 11:00 PM. Yesterday morning at 7:50 AM, he got off the train at Zhenru Station and went straight back to his residence on Pushi Road to rest. Wang stated that he came to Shanghai to meet with Acting Premier Soong Ziwen and ask Soong to formally assume the post of Premier. After Soong agrees, Wang will immediately return to Nanjing, schedule a trip to the north to comfort the soldiers at the front, and meet with Military Affairs Committee Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Otherwise, he intends to stay in Shanghai temporarily, expressing his determination. After Wang got off the train, he telegraphed the Central Standing Committee, proposing to formally appoint Soong as Premier. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Got off at Zhenru</h3>
<p>A reporter from this newspaper drove to Zhenru Station at about 7:00 AM yesterday morning. At that time, there was no one in the station except the staff, and there was no arrangement for armed military police or security teams to be on strict guard. At about 7:40 AM, Wang's secretary arrived at the station to greet him. At 7:50 AM, the train arrived at the station, and Wang and his wife and Zeng Zhongming got off the train and went straight back to his residence on Pushi Road to rest.</p>
<h3>Wang's Remarks</h3>
<p>When Wang got off the train at Zhenru Station, he was wearing a gray suit, and his complexion was rosy and his spirits were good. A reporter from this newspaper immediately stepped forward to talk to him. According to Wang, regarding the issue of the Premier, he was determined to resign because his body had not fully recovered and it was difficult to cope with the demanding tasks. Today, the Central Standing Committee will formally discuss this matter. He has telegraphed requesting the appointment of Mr. Soong Ziwen as Premier. This time, he came to Shanghai to meet with Mr. Soong and urge him to take the post. After Soong agrees, he will return to Nanjing within days, and then schedule a trip to the north to comfort the soldiers at the front and meet with Military Affairs Committee Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. Otherwise, he will stay in Shanghai temporarily and wait for the resolution of this matter.</p>
<h3>Personally Visited Soong Ziwen</h3>
<p>At 9:30 AM, Wang went to Soong's residence in a light car with a simple entourage. He earnestly expressed to Soong that he was unable to cope with the demanding tasks due to his illness, and requested that he reluctantly agree to take the post of Premier. However, Soong still humbly declined, saying that his physical strength was also weak and his blood pressure was still high, so he resolutely refused to take office and refused to act as an agent again. The two men negotiated for 30 minutes, still humbly declining each other, and there was no result in the end. Wang then resigned.</p>
<h3>Zeng Zhongming Said</h3>
<p>According to Zeng Zhongming, the Vice Minister of Railways who accompanied Wang to Shanghai, Mr. Wang refused to resume his post because his body could not support the demanding tasks. This time he came to Shanghai to persuade Mr. Soong to come to Nanjing to do the real thing in order to avoid mistakes and harm the country. After Wang resigned from the post of Premier, he did not completely ignore state affairs and would serve in the Central Party Headquarters. As for whether Wang will return to Nanjing immediately, it depends on the situation of his contact with Vice Premier Soong. The Central Committee held a standing meeting this morning to discuss this matter. If this matter is resolved, Mr. Wang can enter Nanjing in one or two days. If Soong still declines, the Central Committee has no intention of recommending anyone else. The time for Wang and Chiang to meet has not yet been determined. All parties intend to recommend Mr. Chiang to be the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in order to unify military power. I have not heard anything about this in Nanjing. I will return to Nanjing by night train tonight.</p>
<h3>Telegram to the Central Government</h3>
<p>After Wang arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning, he telegraphed the Central Committee, proposing to the Central Standing Committee to formally appoint Acting Premier Soong as Premier. The original text read, "To the Central Executive Committee, Jian: Last year in August, Zhaoming resigned from the post of Premier. The Central Committee decided to order him to concentrate on serving in the Central Party Headquarters, and Vice Premier Soong Ziwen was appointed as Acting Premier. In mid-October, Kuang Zhaoming applied for leave because his illness was serious and he could not serve in the Central Party Headquarters. He was granted leave for three months to go to Europe for treatment. Recently, with the fall of Rehe, he rushed back to Nanjing despite his illness, hoping to share this difficulty with his comrades. However, at this time, he can only do his best and contribute at any time in the Central Party Headquarters. As for the post of Premier, the matter is complicated and the responsibility is heavy. The sick body is not worth cherishing, but harming the country by incurring debts is a deep fault. Since entering Nanjing, he has repeatedly explained this in detail to his comrades, hoping to gain their understanding. This morning is the date of the Central Standing Committee meeting. He dares to sincerely appeal and respectfully asks for understanding and to determine Comrade Soong Ziwen as Premier, cancel the word 'acting', in order to specialize in responsibility and listen to one opinion. As long as Zhaoming has one breath left, he will still follow his comrades in the Central Party Headquarters to face the national crisis together. This proposal is respectfully submitted, awaiting public decision."</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Firmness</h3>
<p>A reporter visited Song Ziwen, the Acting President of the Executive Yuan, at 10:30 yesterday morning. According to Song, Mr. Wang (Jingwei) came this morning and indicated that he would not be returning to his original position as President of the Executive Yuan, and instructed me to continue in that responsibility. However, I firmly stated that I could not take on the role, so that I can specialize in finance. The position of President of the Executive Yuan should naturally be returned to Mr. Wang. At this time of increasing national crisis, if the entire country unanimously urges Mr. Wang, he should be able to reluctantly take on the difficult task and jointly overcome the national crisis. Regarding the central government's policy towards Japan, it is determined to resolutely resist and never compromise. Rumors from the outside suggesting direct negotiations and compromise with Japan are not factual, which is very clear. Japan cannot even accept the resolutions of the League of Nations, and is even considering withdrawing from the League. How is there any possibility they would concede to us? And would our government be willing to submit to a powerful enemy and sign a treaty that would ruin the nation? In any case, anyone who compromises with Japan will certainly be spurned by the entire country. Regarding the military situation in North China, I (Song referring to himself) have no special insights. I only know that the troop movements in Ludong are purely for strategic necessity. The Japanese are spreading rumors that they will disrupt Tianjin and Beijing, and we are also prepared. If the enemy recklessly invades Tianjin and Beijing, they will certainly be met with a fierce counterattack. Recently, various parties have recommended Chairman Chiang Kai-shek as the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, Navy, and Air Force, to unify authority. However, Chairman Chiang himself only seeks military success in resisting the enemy, and does not seek to take on the title.</p>
<h3>Chu Discusses Wang's Medical Treatment</h3>
<p>A Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing on the 23rd reported that Premier Wang (Jingwei) and his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and Tieci Zeng Zhongming, etc., traveled to Shanghai by night train on the 22nd, as reported in the newspapers. A Central News Agency reporter visited Chu Minyi at the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 23rd, inquiring about when Wang would return to Nanjing. Chu replied that since Wang has returned to the country, travel between Nanjing and Shanghai is a common occurrence for various ministers and committee members. As far as I know, this trip to Shanghai is perhaps for medical treatment and blood tests, as drawing blood from a vein for examination is difficult for ordinary doctors. Dr. Nauer, who accompanied Wang to Europe before, also returned to Shanghai with Wang, so Wang is still seeking his diagnosis and treatment.</p>
<p>Yu Mingzhou Speaks</p>
<h3>Applying the Full-Line Attack Plan to Resist Japan</h3>
<p>Also Discussing the Hope for Aid to Launch Hidden Righteous Armies</p>
<p>Yesterday Accompanying Wu Huanzhang to Visit Mayor Wu</p>
<p>Yu Mingzhou, the Heilongjiang Party Affairs Guidance Committee member and Deputy Commander of the Heilongjiang People's Self-Defense Army, and Li Mingxin, the representative of Pu Bingshan and Deng Wen, have successively come to Shanghai to contact various organizations in the city for assistance. Yu spoke with a reporter from the New Voice Society at his residence yesterday, as follows:</p>
<h3>Because of Our Local Resistance</h3>
<p>The Japanese army uses powerful, modern weapons to carry out invasions, but the combat capabilities of their soldiers are extremely weak and not worth a single blow. As seen in the Battle of Nenjiang, the Battle of Shanghai, and the recent Battle of Xifengkou, our army inflicted heavy damage on them. However, the Japanese are using a strategy of defeating each enemy individually, and our country has fallen into the error of local resistance, resulting in successive defeats in Shanghai and the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang. With the loss of Yuguan and the invasion of Rehe, the Japanese have been able to advance leisurely and do whatever they want without any scruples. Now they are pressing on the Great Wall. We must learn from the past and determine that resistance alone is not enough.</p>
<h3>Being Defeated by the Japanese Individually</h3>
<p>The troops that the Japanese army has recently used to invade Rehe are mostly transferred from the provinces of Jilin and Heilongjiang. Three brigades, such as the Suzuki brigade, have fought with our army in Heilongjiang. From the records examined on the bodies of captured enemy soldiers in the battles in Heilongjiang, it is known that most of them participated in the Battle of Shanghai. According to statistics, the Japanese army occupying the four northeastern provinces numbers less than 100,000, which is far fewer than our army. However, due to the result of local resistance, they invaded Shanghai in the south, and after the ceasefire, they were transferred to the Northeast, successively defeating the units of Pu Bingshan, Su Bingwen, Ma Zhanshan, Wang Delin, Feng Zhanhai, and Li Du. They then launched a full-scale invasion of Rehe. The righteous armies in Jilin and Heilongjiang, due to traffic obstruction, cannot connect with each other and act together, leading to their individual defeat. Now the battleground has reached the Great Wall, and the equipment of the central armies is far superior to that of the civilian uprisings. If local resistance is still used, fighting back only where the enemy breaks through, then its future is truly precarious. A plan for a full-line attack should be devised quickly, so that the Japanese army cannot cope, and this is the only way to recover the lost territories.</p>
<h3>Huge Quantities of Russian Goods Imported</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, various goods from the Soviet Union have been continuously transported to China and distributed to cities and markets throughout China, with Shanghai as the center. The important goods being dumped include timber, kerosene, calico, coal, glass, wheat, and fish. An inspection of the import goods of the third ship in the Russian merchant fleet, the Kedsk, on the 21st showed the following: (1) 5,000 tons of kerosene, with a total value of approximately 20 million taels. These goods have been unloaded at the 16th Bund wharf. Except for timber and coal, which are directly managed by Russian merchants, the kerosene is sold by Guanghua Company, and the calico is managed by Da Zhonghua Company.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Radio Address Yesterday</p>
<h3>How Should Citizens Save China?</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu gave a radio address at the Chinese and Western Drugstore Radio Station, arranged by the Bureau of Education, at 7 PM last night, titled "How Should Citizens Save China?" The following is a transcript of his speech:</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, at this time when the life of our nation is in extreme danger and our beautiful land is shrinking day by day, as Japanese troops invade our borders, after rushing about in alarm, being filled with intense emotion, and being in a state of grief and worry, have the people of our entire nation also quietly observed and thought deeply about what caused this unprecedented national crisis? Have you also considered how to rise up and strengthen ourselves to avoid the immense terror of the future and overcome this unprecedented crisis? Have you also considered how to wipe out our shame and strive for strength, how to shoulder the responsibility of saving the nation and resisting foreign aggression, and how to restore the glorious history of our nation? From the perspective of the situation of the entire world, the current situation of China, and the principles of human survival, at this moment, we naturally only have "active resistance" to open up a path for our nation. Moreover, only by working together in harmony, gathering the strength of the nation, and uniting to save the country can we save this unprecedented misfortune and develop new opportunities for the revival of our nation. However, our country has historically been an excellent cultured nation. In terms of population, territory, climate, resources, and all the elements that constitute a nation, we are above other countries. Why are we being invaded and trampled upon? When we are resisting and fighting, if we do not first think deeply about this point and consider why other countries are strong and reflect on why our country has declined, we will not be able to establish a great plan for saving the country and reveal the path to struggle. If everyone only knows blind patriotism and superficial struggle, and does not save the country in the right way or struggle with the right strength, then the result of resistance and struggle will certainly not harm the powerful enemy. In around 1806, after Germany was defeated by Napoleon, an patriotic philosopher, Fichte, gave a speech to their citizens, saying, "We have now been conquered, but whether we will suffer the humiliation of the enemy again and whether we will never be able to restore the glory of the nation all depends on our own determination and our own efforts." "Everyone should know that Germany's failure is not the fault of one or two people, but the common fault of the people of the whole country. It is the result of the ignorance, confusion, immaturity, cowardice, and various morbidities of the people of the whole country. The war of force has now passed. The war from now on is a war of knowledge, a war of morality, and a war of character. Whether we can participate in this kind of war also depends on whether our citizens have the determination." What I hope from the listeners is that you do not seek temporary comfort, do not be complacent, do not be passive, and do not simply engage in grief and indignation. You should engage in thorough thinking and find ways to free yourselves from suffering. "The value of our lives lies in the eternal life of our nation. If the nation dies, we are dead even if we are alive. If the nation lives, we are alive even if we are dead. Therefore, we should sacrifice and fight for the life of the nation." China's situation today is the same as Germany's at that time, and Fichte's speech to the German people is equal to a speech to our citizens. It is very worthy of our citizens' reference and reflection. However, the German nation has been transformed and has become strong after being influenced by Fichte's speech, but the Chinese people have been subjected to the aggression and oppression of the great powers for a hundred years and still cannot awaken and cannot become strong. This cannot but be said to be the greatest weakness and crisis in the spirit of our nation. Now, the general public all know the term "national crisis," but how many people truly understand the meaning of the national crisis and the causes of the national crisis? How many people are truly able to save the country in a practical way? Everyone should know that "worry is enough to revitalize a country." The external troubles of enemy countries are not a national crisis, and military aggression is not enough to destroy a country. Only the self-degeneration of a nation is the greatest crisis and the cause of the nation's demise. If the national spirit can be united and uplifted, and if the national will can be strengthened and developed, then the foundation of the country can naturally be consolidated and the nation can naturally develop. Now, the greatest danger in China is that the general public still does not know the true meaning of the country and the causes of the national crisis, and that those who lead the public to save the country only know how to engage in superficial enthusiasm and cannot make practical efforts. Therefore, in the past hundred years, although there have been national salvation movements after every national crisis, every national salvation movement has failed to save China. We enlightened people should learn from our pain and, from now on, thoroughly recognize the meaning of the national crisis, reflect on the causes of the national crisis, and know that the arrival of the national crisis is not the result of one morning or evening, nor is it the fault of one or two people, but the common fault of the people of the whole country, and it is the result of the long-term accumulation of evils such as ignorance, confusion, immaturity, cowardice, apathy, selfishness, complacency, and laziness of the people of the whole country. Going forward, we should deeply reproach ourselves, strive to become new, be down-to-earth, and make a firm and determined resolution to work hard, be brave, and save the country, starting from culture, economics, everyone's job, and the way of life in peacetime, working hard and realistically to enrich the content of the nation's life and consolidate the foundation for national development. Every effort we make is one point of national salvation, and the sum total of the efforts of the people of the whole country is the final success of the nation's wiping out its shame and striving for strength. The ancients said, "Ten years of breeding, ten years of teaching." Wiping out shame and striving for strength cannot be achieved overnight, but must wait for long-term and practical efforts to take effect. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will abide by this iron law of saving the country, recognize the crux of the current national crisis, determine a long-term struggle policy, and make real efforts to cope with this unprecedented and drastic world change and restore the inherent glory and splendor of our great cultured Chinese nation. If, at this critical moment of life and death, we make mistake after mistake and cannot open a path to survival and struggle for survival, then the tragedy of national subjugation and the catastrophe of racial extermination may be in the near future.</p>
<p>Yunnan Fellow Provincials in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Meeting to Discuss Purchasing Airplanes</h3>
<p>The Yunnan Chamber of Commerce Sends Representatives to Shanghai to Assist</p>
<p>The Kunming Chamber of Commerce in Yunnan Province, considering that Yunnan Province is located in a remote area with inconvenient transportation and that its industry and commerce have not developed, especially at this time of economic competition and promotion of domestic goods, believes that it is necessary to quickly find ways to improve industry and commerce in order to prevent capital outflow. The Chamber has sent Ma Chunlong, a standing committee member and director of the general affairs section of the Chamber, to major cities such as Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Wuhan to conduct thorough investigations in order to learn from them how to improve industry and commerce. Mr. Ma passed through Hong Kong and arrived in Shanghai on the 18th of this month. On the 21st, he met with Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and was guided by Zhu Boyuan, the director of the National Products Market, to visit the National Products Exhibition Hall and the National Products Market. The Chamber of Commerce also sent letters to major factories in the city, introducing Mr. Ma to visit and conduct inspections. It is reported that Mr. Ma plans to complete his investigations in Shanghai and then travel to Beijing, Wuhan, and other places to continue his work.</p>
<p>Also reported, various groups in Yunnan Province, due to the increasing national crisis, have elected representatives to organize the Yunnan People's National Salvation Association, with the aim of concentrating the financial and human resources of the entire province, assisting the government, preparing for national defense, and resisting foreign aggression. They have appointed Zhou Zhongyue, Lu Han, Zhang Banghan, Xu Jizu, Zhu Xu, Li Peiyan, Lu Hexiang, Zhou Zongshun, He Yao, Chen Yuke, etc. as standing committee members, and have approved and implemented the donation methods. The method is based on the goal of raising enough funds for seventy airplanes, with each airplane temporarily set at 150,000 yuan. The provincial capital will raise funds for fourteen airplanes, the outer counties and administrative regions will raise funds for thirty-eight airplanes, national salvation lottery tickets will be issued for fourteen airplanes, and other sources will raise funds for four airplanes. The raised airplanes will be used for commercial purposes in peacetime and will be available for military use in wartime. When raising funds, assets will be used as the standard, divided into six levels: (A) Assets of 100,000 yuan or more in cash will donate 15%; (B) 50,000 yuan or more but less than 100,000 yuan will donate 10%; (C) 30,000 yuan or more but less than 50,000 yuan will donate 8%; (D) 10,000 yuan or more but less than 30,000 yuan will donate 4%; (E) 5,000 yuan or more but less than 10,000 yuan will donate 2%; (F) 1,000 yuan or more but less than 5,000 yuan will donate 1%. However, as the matter is of great importance, the association has specially entrusted Ma Chunlong, a member of the Chamber of Commerce, to take advantage of his investigation of industry and commerce to promote and solicit donations together. After Mr. Ma arrived in Shanghai, he has consulted with the responsible officers of the Yunnan Fellow Provincials Association in Shanghai several times. It has been agreed that everyone has a responsibility for the great plan of saving the country, and there are still many Yunnan people in Shanghai. A meeting of fellow provincials is planned to be convened within days to discuss all the donation methods, so as to advance together both internally and externally and accomplish the great plan together.</p>
<p>Soviet Commercial Inspection Team</p>
<h3>Arriving in Shanghai in Late April</h3>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily, after the Chinese side planned to organize a commercial inspection team to Russia, the Soviet Union also organized a commercial inspection team to China to exchange opinions with each other. The Soviet Union has now selected forty members of the inspection team and is preparing to depart. According to information obtained by the Mutual Aid Society in Shanghai on the 22nd, the team is expected to arrive in Shanghai around the 20th of next month.</p>
<p>Three Provinces Relief Association Remits Funds</p>
<h3>Relieving Rural Areas in Three Provinces</h3>
<p>Totaling 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Provisional Relief Association for the Disaster Areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei telegraphed Chiang Kai-shek, the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, yesterday: "Commander Chiang, Greetings. The telegram was received. The disaster in the three provinces is severe, and relief is urgently needed. Repeatedly receiving your instructions, the members of this association have done their best to actively raise funds in the hope of assisting your concern for the disaster victims. However, due to the impact of the current situation, the amount of donations is small. We have now managed to borrow from the silver and money industry and have decided to remit 70,000 yuan to the Central Bank in Hankou tomorrow for deposit into a special account for rural financial relief, to be coordinated and distributed by your department. Together with the previous remittance of 30,000 yuan, the total is 100,000 yuan. We hereby telegraph a reply for your consideration. Respectfully, Xu Shiying, Wang Zhen, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yong, Zhang Yin, etc. of the Shanghai Provisional Relief Association for the Disaster Areas of Henan, Anhui, and Hubei."</p>
<p>Road Construction Beyond Boundaries</p>
<h3>Telephone Case Has Been Negotiated</h3>
<p>Reporting Fees Passed on to Users</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reported that the telephone contract for road construction beyond boundaries has been delayed in signing because the issue of how to handle the fees required to be reported to the municipal government and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau has not been resolved. It is now heard that this project has been negotiated and agreed upon. The total cost of the fees to be reported in a year is approximately 27,000 taels. Of this amount, nearly half is to be reported to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau. The Shanghai Telephone Company will temporarily treat this amount as a deferred debt, which will be calculated when telephone fees are revised in the future, that is, it will indirectly be borne by all users. The remaining amount to be reported to the Shanghai Municipal Government will be borne half by the telephone users in the roads constructed beyond boundaries and half by the users in the western district, northern district, Zhabei, southern city, and Pudong. As to how the users will bear these fees, nothing is yet known, but it is said that the increase in fees for the users in the western district, northern district, Zhabei, southern city, and Pudong will be extremely small.</p>
<p>China-British Boxer Indemnity Fund</p>
<h3>Approving the Railroad Department's Proposal to Borrow Funds First</h3>
<p>Approximately Over One Million Pounds Recommended for Allocation at the Next Board Meeting</p>
<p>Shanghai Times Electric News Agency reports that the Finance Committee of the Board of Directors of the China-British Boxer Indemnity Fund held its 24th meeting yesterday afternoon at the Bank Club. Those in attendance included Zeng Rongpu, Massey, Song Ziliang, Ye Gongchuo, and Tanner. Those attending as observers included Chen Yaozu, Director of the Railroad Department, and Hang Liwu, the General Secretary of the fund. The item for discussion was the Railroad Department's request to borrow funds first to complete the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, etc. The resolution was to recommend to the Board of Directors meeting next Monday to approve the department's borrowing of existing funds and subsequent funds that become due, approximately over one million pounds. However, the list of materials must be reviewed by the Technical Committee, and all previous collateral, such as passenger and freight rate increases, revenue from the capital ferry, revenue from the Guangzhou-Shaoguan section, and surpluses from the Pinghan Railway, must be clearly listed in the contract. It is also heard that the fund is scheduled to hold its 15th Board of Directors meeting next Monday in Nanjing. In addition to deciding on the loan of materials for the Guangdong-Hankou Railway, there will also be major cases to be discussed, such as the Ministry of Industry's request to borrow materials to jointly operate a distillery with Shanghai merchants, and the Construction Committee's request to allocate 100,000 yuan in cash to reorganize the capital power plant's lines, etc.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Public Telephone Communication</h3>
<p>Can Connect to Each Bureau Along the Shanghai City and Special District Routes</p>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications restored the Wusong telephone, it has set up a public telephone in Baoshan City, which can communicate with the Shanghai City, Concession Special District, and each bureau along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou routes. However, as Baoshan City is not within the scope of Shanghai City, the communication procedures are slightly different from ordinary users. The methods are as follows: (1) All users who have deposited rent for Chinese and foreign calls or long-distance calls can communicate with Baoshan. (2) All users who call the Baoshan telephone (Wusong No. 11) should call out "Baoshan" (or directly call "Wusong No. 11") so that the dispatcher at the originating bureau can record it. (3) After a user communicates with Baoshan (that is, Wusong No. 11), whether the listener is the person called or not, the fees must be paid according to the regulations. (4) If a user calls the Baoshan telephone (that is, Wusong No. 11) and needs to summon the listener, in addition to providing the listener's name and address in detail, the telephone should be hung up immediately to indicate that the call is over and wait for a return call. If the telephone is not hung up or is shaken off, the waiting time will also be charged. (5) All telephones called out from the Baoshan public telephone (that is, Wusong No. 11) must be recorded by the Wusong dispatcher for charging purposes, regardless of whether they are return calls or requests for numbers. (6) If a telephone is called out from the Wusong public telephone (that is, Wusong No. 11) and is a return call, but the original caller at the other bureau has left impatiently, the telephone fee must still be paid. (7) The prescribed communication fees for the Baoshan public telephone (that is, Wusong No. 11) are 5 cents to Wusong, 8 cents to Nanshi and Zhabei, and 10 cents to the Concession. The same fees apply when calling from Wusong, etc., to Baoshan City. If long-distance calls to Beijing-Shanghai or Shanghai-Hangzhou are made, the fees should be added according to the regulations.</p>

<p>Returning Savings from the Three Northeastern Provinces</p>
<h3>Registration Has Begun</h3>
<p>Bureau of Savings and Remittances Announces Repayment Measures</p>
<p>After the General Bureau of Postal Savings and Remittances, with the approval of the Ministry of Finance, ordered the repayment of savings in the three northeastern provinces, Mr. Fang Tinghua, the head of the Savings Department of the bureau, drafted the repayment regulations and registration procedures. The bureau notified the postal administrations in each district yesterday and simultaneously announced the repayment regulations and began registration. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Postal Notice: This is to announce that all depositors within the three northeastern provinces who hold savings deposit books or fixed deposit certificates issued by the Liaoning postal district before July 23, 1932, and by the Jilin and Heilongjiang postal districts before July 25, 1932, must register in person or through their agents at the bureau. This notice is hereby issued so that everyone may be informed.</p>
<p>Repayment Regulations: (1) Savings deposit books can be registered at any post office (excluding sub-branches) within the country that handles savings deposits. Fixed deposit certificates can be registered at post offices (excluding sub-branches) that handle fixed deposits. (2) If depositors wish to keep their savings in the post office, after one month from the date of registration, the registering post office will exchange the old book or certificate for a new one. Savings deposit books and certificates in the Jilin and Heilongjiang districts that were deposited in Haikou silver and do not specify silver dollars will be converted into silver dollars at 80% of their face value. Interest on these retained savings will accrue from the day after the last interest settlement date of the northeastern post offices (i.e., from July 1, 1932). Interest on fixed deposits will be calculated from the original deposit date at the original interest rate. (3) If depositors wish to withdraw these savings, they must also wait one month from the date of registration and then, as usual, submit a withdrawal slip, along with the savings book or fixed deposit certificate, to the original registering office to withdraw the savings. All withdrawal slips and fixed deposit certificates must be signed and stamped with the original seal of the depositor. The interest on the total savings withdrawn will be calculated according to the method in section two above, up to the date of registration. (4) If deemed necessary, the post office may ask the depositor to provide a guarantor with a solid business reputation before repaying the savings. (5) All matters related to the repayment of savings will be handled at the original registering office. If the original savings were deposited in Haikou silver (see section two above), they will be repaid in silver dollars converted at 80% of their face value.</p>
<p>Scope of Registration: According to Mr. Fang Tinghua, the head of the Savings Department, all registration forms and other items have been printed with designs and distributed to various postal administrations for printing so that depositors can obtain and fill them out. To facilitate registration for depositors, registration can be done in Tianjin, Beiping, Hankou, Qingdao, Shanghai, Guangdong, and other postal districts that handle postal remittances. The total amount to be repaid this time is approximately 230,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Antiquities from the Academia Sinica</p>
<h3>Will Be Exhibited in Shanghai</h3>
<p>丨Arrangements to be Made Once the Third Batch Arrives丨</p>
<p>After the decision was made to move the Institute of History and Philology and the Institute of Psychology of the Academia Sinica in Beiping south, in addition to the 120 boxes of antiquities previously transported to Shanghai, there were still 400 boxes. It was originally planned to transport them to Shanghai with the second batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum, but since they were not loaded, they will be transported to Shanghai with the third batch of antiquities from the Palace Museum. According to Mr. Yang Xingfo, after all the antiquities are loaded and transported to Shanghai, they will be displayed in the new building of the Academia Sinica on Avenue Henri Bazin for exhibition.</p>
<p>Vietnamese Constable's Murder Case</p>
<h3>French Consul-General Replies to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The French Municipal Council Provides 2,000 Yuan Each for the Families of the Deceased</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the case of a Vietnamese constable shooting and killing a Chinese person in the French Concession, the Support Association for the case previously petitioned the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to negotiate with the French Consulate. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that the case was a local matter and should be handled by the local government. In addition to instructing the association, it also sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Government for investigation and handling, as previously reported. It is now learned that the French Consulate-General has sent a reply to the Municipal Government, which is excerpted below: In reply to your letter No. 172 of the 13th of this month, received with respect. The following facts are hereby reported: On February 25th, a Vietnamese constable was escorting a person who had violated police regulations on Rue du Pont Neuf to the police station when a large number of passers-by suddenly attacked, attempting to rescue the violator. During the struggle, the Vietnamese constable fired a shot with live ammunition, which accidentally went off, injuring passers-by and resulting in the death of two people. Afterward, a criminal investigation was immediately conducted on the Vietnamese constable, and the French Consular Court will try the case. Respect for the judiciary is required, so no comments can be made on the responsibility of the accused before the verdict of the court with jurisdiction. In order to urgently assist the families of the two deceased Chinese, the French Municipal Council has provided 2,000 yuan each for the families of the deceased, and the families have agreed to accept it. In response to the previous letter, the above is respectfully reported to your mayor for your information. With best wishes, 梅禮靄 (Mei Liai).</p>
<p>Workers at the Nanyang Tobacco Factory</p>
<h3>Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Social Affairs is Scheduled to Mediate Again Today</p>
<p>A dispute has recently arisen at the Nanyang Tobacco Factory on Broadway Road in Hongkou due to workers' demands for improved treatment. The workers petitioned the Municipal Government yesterday, and the Bureau of Social Affairs convened a mediation session. The Special District Court opened a trial yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government: Workers' representatives Zhang Zhang, Weng Lin, Xu Zhubao, Yu Xingqing, and Wang Jiansheng, carrying a written petition, went to the Municipal Government yesterday afternoon. Since Mayor Wu was out, Zhang Chengwu of the Municipal Government received them. The representatives put forward five demands: (1) Release the arrested workers. (2) Order the factory to withdraw all security vehicles and Chinese and foreign detectives. (3) Order the Bureau of Social Affairs to resolve the preliminary conditions for labor and management as soon as possible. (4) Send a letter to the First Special District Court to notify the police not to arbitrarily arrest workers. (5) Stop the arrest warrants for union leaders. Mr. Zhang expressed acceptance and promised to forward the matter to the mayor for review. The workers' representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<p>Petition to the Municipal Government: The union's petition to the Municipal Government states: Regarding the Nanyang Tobacco Factory, which experienced a decline in business and capital losses in 1929, leading to a temporary shutdown, all employees, aware of the situation and unwilling to see a Chinese industrial factory fail, adopted the principle of labor-management cooperation to jointly develop the industry. They voluntarily reduced wages, increased work, endured hardships, and worked hard to produce, cooperating sincerely with the factory. As a result, business gradually improved in recent years, with a profit of over one million yuan throughout 1932. While the employees do not dare to claim credit for this, they can take comfort in it. However, the factory management not only disregarded the employees' hard work in supporting the factory and showed no compassion but also wantonly trampled on and heavily oppressed them, causing labor-management relations to deteriorate and the previous spirit of cooperation to disintegrate. (omitted) Therefore, at 10:00 AM on the 20th of this month, they all spontaneously went on strike to express their determination and urge the factory to realize the situation. After party and government authorities sent personnel to the factory to mediate and persuade them to resume work, a dispute arose. Representative Zhang Decheng was arrested by the police and transferred to the court. In the past two days, responsible representatives Wu Shiyuan, Li Ajin, and Li Gui were successively arrested and also transferred to the court, but have not been released. The factory is using all kinds of despicable and insidious means to destroy the workers' organization, which shows its intentions. The union, having the important responsibility of representing the entire factory's workers, should be given reasonable protection. In addition to petitioning the city party headquarters and the Bureau of Social Affairs for review, representatives Zhang Zhang and others have been sent to present the situation and petition. We implore your government to review and approve the matter and order the Bureau of Social Affairs to promptly convene labor and management for mediation on the preliminary conditions for labor and management. We also request that the Nanyang Tobacco Factory be ordered to stop arresting worker representatives, and that the arrested worker representatives be released to benefit the labor movement. The undersigned is eager to await your command. Respectfully submitted by Zhou Xuexiang, Standing Committee Member of the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, to Mayor Wu.</p>
<p>Convening Mediation: In order to prevent the expansion of the dispute, the Bureau of Social Affairs convened a mediation session between labor and management at 2:00 PM yesterday. The Nanyang factory sent its legal advisor, Wu Linkun, as its representative, and the labor side was represented by Zhang Zhang. The mediation was chaired by Wang Xianqing, Director of the Mediation Section of the Bureau of Social Affairs. As the management did not attend in person, no mediation could be conducted. It was rescheduled for 10:00 AM tomorrow (the 25th) at the Bureau of Social Affairs, with a strict order that the factory send an important official to attend.</p>
<p>Court Opens Trial: The case of Zhang Desheng, foreman of the tobacco leaf section of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, assaulting employee Li Zhitang and others has been transferred by the Hongkou Huishan police to the First Special District Court, charging Zhang and his followers Wu Shiyuan and Li Ajin with crimes such as assault and destruction of property. Under questioning by the judge, they were ordered to be detained pending investigation. The police also arrested Li Gui, a worker in the tobacco leaf section, and Li Xinfang, a carpenter, the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, witnesses Feng Haiquan, Wang Huifa, He Ganyun, Chen Fengxiang, and Zhu Yonghua were summoned and sent to the First Special District Court. Judge Xiao Xiexun conducted the interrogation. Zhang Tianyin, the police lawyer, presented the circumstances of the recent disturbance. He then stated that Zhang Desheng and others had been scheduled for a hearing on the 28th and requested that this case also be rescheduled to be heard together. Then, witnesses such as Feng Haiquan testified that Li Gui wielded an iron rod at the scene to assault people, and Li Xinfang, although unarmed, was also supporting the assault at the scene. Wu Linkun, the representative lawyer of the Nanyang Company, appeared in court as an observer. After the court briefly questioned the defendants, it ordered them to be detained pending rescheduling for a joint hearing.</p>
<p>Union Office: The Nanyang Tobacco Factory Office of the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union was formally established on the 12th. Due to the current dispute, the union's affairs have been disrupted. To facilitate contact with all parties, the office has temporarily been located at 106 Qiaojia Road in the Nanshi area. The office issued a statement and a letter to workers yesterday, which were very tactful and moving, and are therefore omitted.</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Cables Thanks for Condolence Donations</h3>
<p>Zhu Ziqiao Cables: Yanfang, Li Ming, Lu Jianquan, Feng Gengguang, He Kun Company, Yang Zhixiong, Madam Wu Yunbao (Wu Wang Hanqing), Madam Wu Zhijiu, Li Bohan, Shen Wencui, Shen Wenyao, Gentlemen, I acknowledge your telegram and immediately forwarded it to Commander-in-Chief Song Zheyuan. I have received a reply telegram from Song Zheyuan stating, "I have received your telegram. I was ashamed that I did not achieve complete success during the previous small defeat of the enemy. I am ashamed to receive condolence donations from Comrade Yanfang and others. From now on, I will only encourage the soldiers to bravely kill the enemy and recover our lost territories to comfort the people of the country. I hereby express my gratitude via telegram and request that you convey it. Song Zheyuan bows." The donation of 5,000 yuan has been received and I will write to the military office to have them come to the meeting to receive it. The receipt will be sent to Brother 克 (Ke) for delivery. Zhu Qinglan bows, Ma Cai.</p>
<h3>Japanese Envoy Arima Returns to Japan Today</h3>
<p>Talks with Japanese Journalists Yesterday</p>
<p>The Japanese Shanghai Daily News reports that the Japanese Envoy to China, Arima Akira, is scheduled to return to Japan today at 9:00 AM, accompanied by Secretary Okazaki and Secretary Asaka, on the Nagasaki Maru. Yesterday, he met with a group of journalists (from Japanese newspapers) and made the following remarks: I (Arima refers to himself) plan to stay in Japan for about three weeks. After arriving in Tokyo on the morning of the 27th, I will immediately meet with Foreign Minister Uchida and then go to Kyoto on the 2nd of next month. Rumors that I am returning to Japan to make important suggestions are completely untrue. There is always telegraphic communication between Shanghai and Tokyo to convey ideas. When I met with Jiang Zuobin the other day, we only talked about interesting things such as hot springs and forests, and did not mention any major issues.</p>

<h3>News on Foreign Ratepayers' Elections</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reports that the British Ratepayers Association Committee has considered the issue of the Municipal Council elections and agreed that, in order to avoid an unequal representation of foreign taxpayers, two Japanese candidates and two American candidates should be elected. As for the British candidates, they felt it unnecessary to offer any suggestions and would leave it to the voters to elect them as they wished.</p>
<p>The election dates are next Monday and Tuesday, with two polling locations: one at the Municipal Council building at 209 Jiangxi Road and one at the Hongkou Police Station, from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Municipal Council Candidates' Political Views</h3>
<p>Recording Shortcomings of the Court</p>
<p>Curbing Anti-Japanese Boycotts</p>
<p>Opposing Increased Number of Chinese Councilors</p>
<p>Inspecting Factories</p>
<p>The British candidates for the Shanghai Municipal Council, Peel and six others, published their political views in the Shanghai Western newspapers yesterday:</p>
<p>Peel said, "If re-elected, I intend to continue my previous policy of striving to maintain the rights and freedoms of the International Settlement and cooperate with the authorities in the neighboring areas to seek common welfare. In particular, I intend to seek a satisfactory agreement regarding the roads built outside the Settlement. I advocate strict reductions in government spending, but I will not be stingy with the funds used to maintain the peace and reputation of the Settlement."</p>
<p>Blair said, "If elected, I intend to support policies that move towards the greatest possible municipal cooperation, in order to maintain the interests of the Settlement according to the broadest possible interpretation."</p>
<p>Arnold said, "If re-elected, I intend to continue the policies implemented by the Municipal Council last year and will not allow the rights of the International Settlement to be eroded. The Municipal Council has two major issues that deserve attention: (1) Closely scrutinizing all expenses, because based on current spending, it will soon be necessary to increase tax rates or raise huge debts. (2) Concluding an agreement with the Shanghai Municipal Government regarding the construction of roads outside the Settlement. Currently, public utilities such as the electricity company, water company, and telephone company cannot connect with new users until this agreement is reached. The prolonged unresolved issue of roads outside the Settlement is a major obstacle to concluding such contracts."</p>
<p>Massey said, "If re-elected, I will do my best to mediate the unfortunate dispute between the landlords and the water company, maintain the strength of the defense forces and police, and, to the extent that finances allow, promote beneficial sanitation and general development projects. I will especially focus on improving the administration of the District Court."</p>
<p>Harris said, "I believe that the most important thing now is to maintain the integrity and security of the foreign settlements. The peace, tranquility, and prosperity of Shanghai and the surrounding areas should be given first consideration. When we are surrounded by this state of disturbance, we cannot show any weakness in upholding our treaty rights. The District Court agreement has now been extended for another three years. This issue will not be raised for consideration this year, but the Municipal Council should carefully monitor the administration of the court. Any inappropriate judgments or executions should be recorded one by one, so that when the agreement is revised in the future, evidence of the current organizational and operational shortcomings of the court can be presented, and a judicial system that can guarantee fairness for all can be demanded. One of the most important issues awaiting resolution today is the status of roads outside the Settlement. I believe that while maintaining the essential elements of effective police management, an agreement can be reached with the Chinese authorities that allows for legitimate and necessary expansion and allows those who currently reside or will reside in the expanded area to live in peace and receive the benefits of various public utilities necessary for life. As for the important issue of Shanghai's future status, it seems that it will soon be considered by the major powers. I believe that the foreign residents of Shanghai should unite to form a foreign association that can serve as a platform for expressing their opinions. All matters involving the interests of Shanghai should be discussed with the Shanghai Municipal Council and the French Municipal Council, and they should be allowed to have appropriate representation. This is extremely important. The Municipal Council's first responsibility is to focus on the best interests of the residents in governing the Settlement, maintaining peace and order, and curbing illegal activities and anti-Japanese boycotts. If the Municipal Council's power to act is insufficient, it should use various opportunities to make this power appropriately sufficient. I have conducted special research in finance and economics for the past 25 years, so I believe that we should be aware of the impact of the economic downturn on cities around the world and prepare for possible methods to prevent this trend from affecting Shanghai."</p>
<p>Macnaghten said, "If elected, I will do my best to maintain the esteemed integrity of the Settlement's administration. Regarding the Municipal Council's policies and the allocation of government funds, the safety and sanitation of the citizens should be given first consideration. In terms of safety, I will never be stingy with the expenses of maintaining the effectiveness of the police, fire department, and merchant corps. Although Shanghai is temporarily peaceful on the surface, past history tells us that disturbances often come like a sudden hurricane, with little prior warning. Therefore, we must always be prepared to deal with emergencies. In terms of sanitation, I will also never be stingy with the funds for purchasing open spaces and public works. I also believe that when a special meeting of taxpayers is convened in the future to discuss revising the bylaws and limiting the licensing of factories, a sufficient number of people will be able to attend to meet the statutory quorum. I firmly believe that Shanghai has a boundless future and recognize that traffic problems are also extremely important. My traffic policy advocates three things: developing transportation facilities between the city and outlying areas, quickly resolving the issue of roads outside the Settlement, and expanding the scope of activities of existing public utility companies to provide public utility services to gradually prosperous areas outside the Settlement."</p>
<p>Landale said, "My approach and views on municipal administration are roughly as follows: As China continues to be turbulent and unstable, we should strive to protect the rights of foreign taxpayers in the Settlement as permitted by the Yangjingbang Regulations. Without increasing the number of foreign directors, we oppose further increasing the number of Chinese directors. We should try to resolve the issue of roads outside the Settlement as soon as possible. We should also rely on the full strength of the police, supplemented by incentives for volunteer service and special constables, to do our best to ensure the peace and security of the Settlement, because the troops stationed in Shanghai from various countries may be withdrawn at any time. Because the duties of the police are extremely important and dangerous, they must not be left with vacancies. I also believe that the time has come for the Municipal Council to manage factories and should give the Municipal Council the power to issue licenses and inspect factories. Regarding education and the problems of Chinese people in the Settlement, due to the Municipal Council's limited finances, the matter must be carefully considered. It is believed that education funding should be limited to a certain percentage of the Settlement's total income. Subsidies for various agencies that handle work beneficial to the public should also be given sympathetic consideration. I certainly know that if the above are implemented, it will inevitably increase expenditures, but if this money can be used properly, it may prove to be an economic move in the long run. Even if the cost of living is rising daily, a slight increase in taxes may not be very objectionable. In addition, the election method in the Yangjingbang Regulations should also be revised."</p>
<p>Railway Department Suspends Station Relocation</p>
<h3>Pengpu Municipal Committee Requests Resumption of Sales</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways used civilian land in the Pengpu Zhenru area to relocate the Shanghai North Railway Station on the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railways. Now, the Ministry of Railways has temporarily suspended the relocation due to the current national crisis. The Pengpu Municipal Committee, Zhou Bulian and Ling Zhibin, stated that tens of thousands of acres of land in Pengpu have been suspended from sale, affecting tens of thousands of farming households. Since the Ministry of Railways is not buying the land, it should be released for sale immediately to relieve the local economy and benefit the people's livelihood. They have submitted this intention to the Municipal Government.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Finance Approves Export of Silver Coins</h3>
<p>Issued an Order Yesterday to the Jianghai Customs to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance has issued an order to the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai regarding the export of legal silver coins, with passports issued by the supervisory authority: Regarding the implementation of measures to ban the transportation of silver coins, since the implementation of the regulations, if legal silver coins are transported from foreign ports to domestic ports and there is a certificate from the foreign Chinese Chamber of Commerce, they should be temporarily allowed to be imported. The currency department of the Shanghai Customs Department had previously agreed with the currency department to stipulate that the customs department should order the Inspector General of Customs to comply. Now it has been stipulated that legal silver coins transported from domestic ports to foreign ports will be allowed to be exported with a passport issued by the supervisory authority to facilitate circulation. The remaining provisions will still be handled in accordance with the previous ban on transportation measures. In addition to issuing separate orders, the superintendent is hereby ordered to comply with this order and instruct the Customs Commissioner to comply with it.</p>

<h3>Enduring to Sell Large Quantities of Old Iron to Aid the Enemy</h3>
<p>Remote Yangjing Town in Pudong</p>
<p>Has Recently Made Two Transactions</p>
<p>It has recently come to our attention that Japanese agents are buying up large quantities of old iron in China. This has occurred several times in Shanghai alone. Unexpectedly, someone has even been purchasing iron in the remote town of Yangjing in Pudong. There have been two transactions recently. The enthusiastic residents nearby all believe that the sellers are greedy for profit and are heartlessly aiding the enemy. They are all extremely indignant. The following is a record of the information we have been able to gather. However, the actions of both the buyer and seller are kept strictly secret, making it very difficult to obtain full details.</p>
<p>First Time, 100 Loads: The first transaction took place on the 13th of this month. A certain sugar mill in the town loaded over 100 loads of old iron onto a ship at 4:00 PM, preparing to transport it out. It is said that a Japanese person had arrived at the mill one day prior to negotiate, agreeing on a price of 280 taels of silver, which was paid in full at the time. This was discovered by a Mr. Pan, a citizen of the town, who witnessed several people carrying the iron onto the ship. He was overcome with anger and reported it to a certain authority, requesting that it be seized. It is unknown how it was handled at the time.</p>
<p>Second Time, 500 Loads: The second transaction took place on the 20th of this month. A certain sugar mill in Xizhakou, also in the town, carried over 500 loads of old iron that had been gradually accumulated, to the Yangjing port at 2:00 PM, loading it onto two large ships. Just as they were about to cast off, a certain detective happened to see it and immediately reported it to a certain authority for a decision. The outcome is unknown.</p>
<h3>Heavy Rain in the City Yesterday</h3>
<p>Midday Sky Suddenly Darkens</p>
<p>The weather in the city has been erratic lately, alternating between cold and warm. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, it started with a light drizzle, followed by a dense cloud cover. It looked like a downpour was imminent. By 1:00 PM, it had become exceptionally dark. Stores along the roads turned on their electric lights to do business. A heavy rain soon followed, accompanied by thunder. The dark clouds dispersed after about an hour, but the rain continued to fall.</p>
<h3>City Bank Moves into New Premises</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Bank has been in operation for three years since its establishment. Its business has been thriving year after year, with great momentum. Due to the increase in capital and expansion of business, the original bank premises were no longer sufficient. They have selected the old site at No. 24 Tianjin Road, opposite the original location, as the new bank premises. The renovations have been completed in recent days. It is said that they are scheduled to move into the new premises on the 27th of this month, and refreshments will be provided to welcome guests from all walks of life to visit and provide guidance. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time.</p>
<h3>Lawyers Association to Hold a General Meeting</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association has scheduled a spring general meeting for all members on April 16th (Sunday) at the Lake Society on Beijing Road in the Public Concession. The executive and supervisory committee members will be re-elected. In addition to having requested the Shanghai District Court and the First and Second Special District District Courts to send prosecutors to supervise the meeting, the City Party Department has also been invited to send personnel to attend and provide guidance. A notice has been sent to all members, stating: Respectfully, we hereby announce that the spring regular general meeting will be held at 2:00 PM on April 16th (Sunday) this year at the Lake Society on Beijing Road, and officers will be re-elected. Any member who has a proposal should submit it to the association ten days before the meeting so that it can be printed and distributed. Any member who has unpaid membership dues should pay the arrears before the meeting (a statement of arrears is attached separately) to avoid being reported for withdrawal from the association. In addition to having published a notice in the newspaper, we are writing to inform you. We hope that you will attend the meeting on time.</p>

<h3>Progress of the Silkworm and Silk Control Association</h3>
<p>The Silkworm and Silk Control Committee of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces, since its last meeting in Wuxi, where leaders of the silkworm and silk industries, along with financial figures and silkworm and silk experts, convened to discuss implementation measures and establish an executive committee, formally announcing its establishment, it has been learned that the standing committee of the association is now located inside the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Silk Cocoon General Office on North Shansi Road in this city. Yesterday (23rd), at 2:00 PM, the first standing committee meeting was held, chaired by the director of the Zhejiang Construction Department. The standing committee members meticulously discussed the first step of implementation. The meeting adjourned after 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>County Government</p>
<h3>Plans to Renovate North Bridge Town Streets</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai County government moved to North Bridge, it strived to develop and promote the town's commerce. However, the town's streets were quite narrow. It has been actively working to renovate and widen them. It has already ordered the technical director to prepare a plan and submit it to the Jiangsu Construction Department. Once approved, the renovation will begin immediately.</p>
<h3>Additional Canal Tax and Exemption from Late Payment Penalties</h3>
<p>The Finance Bureau of the Shanghai County government issued a public notice yesterday, stating that it had received an instruction from the Jiangsu Finance Department, which stated that the Qingpu, Songjiang, and other counties had successively telegraphed, stating that the people were feeling the burden of the two yuan additional canal tax, which was continued for another year. They were painfully paying the increased tax. Moreover, after the disasters of war and floods, the local vitality had not yet recovered. Furthermore, the low price of grain was harming farmers, and the economy was becoming even more depleted. They requested that the late payment penalties for the additional canal tax be waived to alleviate the people's hardship. All late payment penalties for the additional canal tax should be approved and exempted from calculation, and a uniform order should be issued. In addition to issuing instructions to other departments, the director of the bureau should be instructed to comply accordingly. In accordance with this order, the late payment penalties for the two yuan additional canal tax under the second installment of the twenty-first year land price tax are reduced and exempted from collection. In addition to instructing the grain counter to comply, a public notice is issued to all households in the county for their information.</p>
<h3>Madam Huang Passed Away Yesterday</h3>
<p>Enjoyed a Longevity of Ninety-Three Years</p>
<p>Madam Huang, the mother of Mr. Huang Qinglan, was kind and charitable, and devoutly believed in Buddhism. She passed away yesterday, achieving Buddhahood at the age of ninety-three.

<h3>German Youth Walking Group Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>A group of five members of the German Youth World Walking Tour, who departed from Germany last year, crossed the Atlantic Ocean to the United States, and recently crossed the Pacific Ocean to China, has arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. The group has visited local officials in all the places they have passed through. When they were in the United States, they even met with President Hoover. Therefore, after the group arrived in Shanghai, they requested Mr. Bai Rende, the German Acting Consul-General in Shanghai, to introduce them. They plan to visit Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government on Fenglin Bridge next week.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Xia Qifeng Returns to France to Visit Family</h3>
<p>Mrs. Xia Qifeng, the French wife of Mr. Xia Qifeng, the former League of Nations secretary and current member of the Treaty Committee of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, has been in China with her husband for several years. They have a very loving relationship. It has been learned that Mrs. Xia, having resided in China for a long time, is scheduled to return to Paris on a French mail ship tomorrow to visit her relatives and friends. She will return to Shanghai as soon as she has finished her affairs.</p>
<h3>Rapid Progress of the Marriage Reform Association</h3>
<p>The Farmer Education Center of this county, believing that the marriage system, ceremonies, and expenses all need to be improved, specifically organized a Marriage Reform Association last year and filed it with the county for record. After the association was organized, membership has grown daily. Letters have also been received from Zhejiang, Anhui, Sichuan, and Fujian requesting membership. The association's officers, Zhang Yi, Ru Bocai, and Jiang Bi, have more detailed plans for expanding the association's affairs. At this time of deep national humiliation, saving the public's expenses is a matter of utmost urgency. If the association's spirit can be promoted in various places, it will be greatly beneficial to the people's livelihood and the national economy.</p>
<p>Hankou</p>
<h3>Two Indian Policemen Exempted from Deportation</h3>
<p>English Ansat Inspectorate's Judgment Yesterday</p>
<p>The two Indian deputy policemen in Hankou, who were sentenced to one year of imprisonment for committing crimes and were to be deported after serving their term, appealed to the English Ansat Inspectorate Court some time ago to be exempted from deportation. It was recorded in yesterday's newspaper. The case has been judged. It seems that the defendants have already served their sentence of imprisonment and must be deported. It seems that the punishment is too severe. If the defendants each provide a guarantee of 500 yuan at the expiration of their imprisonment to ensure good behavior within two years, they will be allowed to be exempted from deportation.</p>

<p>The French Municipal Council replied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, stating: Respectfully, we previously received a letter stating that the rickshaw industry association requested that the refusal of permits for rickshaws in the Pu, Song, Zaojing, Fahua, and Zhenru districts be investigated and handled.

The number of permits for this year is limited to 17,000 vehicles. We hereby inform you. We hope that you will investigate accordingly.</p>
<h3>Dispute Resolved at the Siyi Silk Factory</h3>
<p>The Siyi Silk Factory on Zhoujiazui Road in Hongkou, specializing in weaving Chinese silk georgette and Indian silk, has more than 60 male and female workers. The original wages were 9 and a half cents per yard for Chinese silk georgette and 6 cents per yard for Indian silk. Recently, the management wanted to reduce the wages by 20%, which was opposed by all the workers. The management closed the factory gate on the morning of the 21st of this month, refusing to let the workers work, causing a dispute. The workers immediately petitioned the Social Bureau, requesting it to intervene. Yesterday at 3:00 PM, the Social Bureau summoned both labor and management for mediation. Chen Biheng and Yu Shuli represented the labor side, and Zhang Zhongyu and Zhang Jilu represented the management side. The mediation was chaired by Tan Peiyan of the Social Bureau. The results of the mediation were: (1) The factory will be responsible for continuing to operate at the end of April. (2) The workers will return to their hometowns, and the factory will provide them with travel expenses of 8 yuan. (3) If the factory cannot be opened by the deadline, in addition to being legally dismissed, they will be given a subsidy of 10 yuan for meals. At that time, both labor and management were satisfied, and the mediation was concluded.</p>
<h3>Zhang Ming Visits the Labor Children's School</h3>
<p>Zhang Ming, the former special envoy to Nepal, visited the Chinese Christian Labor Children's School on Yulin Road yesterday afternoon. The school was founded by Ms. Mei Yunying, who studied in the United States. It has 700 students and has been painstakingly managed for more than ten years, with considerable success. There is also a teacher, Ms. Liu Jinfang, who also studied in the United States and was a classmate of Special Envoy Zhang's late wife, Ms. Chen. She is in charge of teaching. The school also has a pharmacy staffed with doctors who provide relief to the poor nearby, which is truly a charitable act. Special Envoy Zhang immediately donated dozens of yuan for the school's medical expenses. After lunch, he returned (to his residence).</p>
<h3>Gu Ben Soap Promoted in Other Cities</h3>
<p>Gu Ben Soap, a national product, is produced by the Wuzhou Gu Ben Soap and Medicine Factory. The manufacturing machinery is complete, and the products are of excellent quality. However, due to the large sales volume, the 1,300 boxes produced daily are insufficient to meet the demand in this city alone, and there is even a shortage in other cities. The factory, in order to develop the strength of national goods, has expanded its scope and increased production. It has now been promoted to various cities in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, sold by branches of Wuzhou Pharmacy.</p>
<p>泰德芝 (Tai De Zhi - likely a foreign name)</p>
<h3>Repeat Offender of Opium Trafficking</h3>
<p>Imprisonment for a Year and a Half and a Fine of 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Qin Dezhi, a native of Wuxi, was found some time ago with a package of raw opium weighing two pounds hidden on his person. He was passing through the intersection of Zhengjia Muqiao Street on Avenue Edward VII when he was spotted by detectives, who found his actions suspicious. They searched him and found the raw opium, and brought him to the police station. It was found that Qin had previously been convicted of transporting opium and had been punished by the court. The chief ordered him to be detained and sent to the Second Special District Court, where he was publicly prosecuted under Article 6 of the Anti-Opium Law. According to Qin's confession, he was sending it to the North Station to be handed over to a Mr. Wang to be taken to another city. After a trial, Judge Wu Fanglian yesterday sentenced the defendant to one year and six months of imprisonment and a fine of 3,000 yuan for repeatedly possessing raw opium with the intention of trafficking. The raw opium was confiscated.</p>
<h3>Cook in Congee Shop Suddenly Slashed</h3>
<p>Two Assailants Fled the Scene</p>
<p>Zhao Jintong, a 27-year-old man from Danyang, was working as a cook at the Zhan Xingjiang Congee Shop at No. 52 on Baoliqiao Road in the French Concession. At around 6:00 AM today, while Zhao was working in the shop, two people suddenly rushed into the shop with kitchen knives. Without asking any questions, they slashed Zhao three times, once in the back and once on each hand. Zhao cried out for help and immediately fell to the ground, seriously injured. The assailants, seeing that their goal had been achieved, fled the scene. The shop owner later transported him to Renji Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Two Cases of Assault with Sharp Weapons</h3>
<p>Suspicion Arises: Zheng A'wu, a man from Ningbo residing at No. 47 Renchang Lane, Qiwu Pu Road, Yangshupu, is 29 years old and works as a sampan rower for the water patrol. Zheng has a friend named Xin Xincai, 40 years old, who is also in the same profession but is currently unemployed and staying at home, residing at a certain number in Haitian Lane of the water plant workshop. Last night at 7:30 PM, Zheng went to Xin's place, but Xin was not home. Zheng then chatted with Xin's wife, and they seemed to be having a very pleasant time. Around 8:00 PM, Xin returned joyfully and saw a man and a woman talking and laughing in the room, immediately becoming suspicious. He rushed into the kitchen, grabbed a sharp axe, and came out, striking Zheng's head twice and his right hand once, causing Zheng to fall into a pool of blood. Subsequently, two constables, numbers 1382 and 1592, rushed to the scene and transported Zheng to Tongren Hospital for treatment by vehicle.</p>
<p>Anger Turns to Violence: Cai Jisheng, a local resident over fifty years old, runs the Huafu Beef Shop at No. 2270 Peng Road. His son, Cai Yifei, is 20 years old, young and handsome, and usually manages the shop's affairs in an orderly manner. Yesterday afternoon at 4:30 PM, Cai Yifei ordered a shop assistant named Zhang Genmei to go out and collect payments with a receipt. Zhang, due to his youth and impetuousness, refused to follow orders, and a dispute arose during their conversation. Unexpectedly, Zhang became enraged and grabbed a pig-slaughtering knife, slashing Yifei's abdomen, causing profuse bleeding. He was later sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment by vehicle.</p>
<h3>Shallow Water Fees for the Xiang River Completely Abolished</h3>
<p>Effective Today</p>
<p>Last winter, due to the receding water levels in the Xiang River, transportation was inconvenient. The various shipping companies decided to increase the shallow water fees, by as much as eighty percent. Since the beginning of spring, the water level in that route has gradually risen. On the first of this month, the shallow water fees were reduced by thirty percent, leaving a remaining fifty percent. Yesterday, the various companies in this port received a telegram from their Hankou branch, stating that the remaining fifty percent of the shallow water fees has now been decided to be completely abolished starting tomorrow (i.e., today), the fourteenth. After receiving the telegram, the companies immediately notified the customs brokers to inform their clients. However, the shallow water fees for the Hankou to Yichang and Shashi route will remain temporarily unchanged, but it is expected that they will also be abolished soon.</p>
<p>Eastern Shanghai</p>
<h3>Meeting of the Association Against Water Shutoffs Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai East Association Against Water Shutoffs held its sixth executive committee meeting yesterday at 5:00 PM, chaired by Wang Yaozeng. The following resolutions were passed: (1) The representative of the Sanyuan Lane members reported that the landlord of the lane was forcing tenants to pay water bills based on the water meter system, and requested assistance. It was resolved to send a letter to the Real Estate Association, requesting them to immediately warn the landlord of the lane to stop the practice. (2) Regarding the water fee issue, it was resolved to absolutely deny the price increase and persist to the end until the goal is achieved. (3) The representative of Jin Yang Lane reported that the main water pipe of the lane, which had been cut off by the water company, was restored to its original condition on the first of this month. It was resolved to send a letter to the Real Estate Association to investigate the situation and then take action. Other cases were then discussed, and the meeting adjourned at 7:30 PM.</p>
<p>Bodyguard's Shout of Kidnapping</p>
<h3>Actually Scares Away the Kidnappers</h3>
<h3>Zhang Yunjin Escapes Kidnappers' Grasp</h3>
<p>Kidnappers' Elaborate Prearrangements</p>
<p>Some Selling Wonton, Some Pulling Rickshaws</p>
<p>Fleeing in Panic at the Shout, Abandoning Handgun</p>
<p>The Kidnapping of Zhou Xitang Also By Such Ruffians</p>
<p>Zhang Yunjin, a native of Ningbo, 50 years old, lives at No. 359 Gaoun Road in the French Concession. He runs a hardware store in Fengtian and is in modest circumstances, owning a private car with license plate number 6577, driven by Xue Sichuan, a local resident. Because kidnapping cases are rampant nowadays, for protection, he hired Qiu Zhaoshan from Hebei as a bodyguard, who accompanies him everywhere. Zhang is fond of Peking opera and regularly goes to the Zhengyi Theater at No. 184 Shandong Road, Nanjing Road, to learn Peking opera. Before 2:00 AM yesterday morning (i.e., late at night on the 22nd), Zhang, his wife, and Qiu Zhaoshan went to Zhengyi Theater again. At 2:15 AM, as they exited the theater, suddenly six or seven kidnappers, each holding a handgun, stepped forward and threatened Zhang, intending to kidnap him. At that time, Qiu Zhaoshan, unprepared, did not have time to resist with his gun and had no choice but to shout "Kidnapping!" The kidnappers, hearing the shout, were greatly alarmed and feared that the police would arrive. They abandoned Zhang and fled in all directions. The responsible general police station received a report and immediately ordered Chinese detectives Xie Shuiquan, Pang Ruiqing, Geng Debiao, and others to rush to the scene to search for the kidnappers. However, the kidnappers had already disappeared without a trace. After investigation by Detective Xie and others, it was learned that the kidnappers' procedures this time were quite thorough. They had all disguised themselves beforehand, some as wonton sellers, others as rickshaw pullers, and lay in wait in the small alley next to the Zhengyi Theater to avoid the attention of police officers. The kidnappers' failure this time was all due to Qiu Zhaoshan's shout. In their hasty escape, the kidnappers even left behind a handgun with nine bullets at the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, in front of the Hengdali Watch Shop. The detectives picked it up and found that the gun's number was 443803. The gun belonged to Zhou Xitang, a comprador of the Lao Gongmao Foreign Firm, whose bodyguard, a Russian named Wei Weisha Luofu, was carrying it. Recently, Zhou was suddenly attacked by a number of kidnappers near the Dada Wharf in the Chinese territory. Zhou resisted, and the kidnappers opened fire, wounding Zhou and killing the bodyguard Wei on the spot, stealing the gun Wei was carrying and scattering. Zhou also died of his injuries at Tongren Hospital. From this, it can be inferred that the kidnappers who kidnapped Zhang were the same ones who killed Zhou and Wei. The detectives later found two carrying poles left behind by the kidnappers next to the Zhengyi Theater. Along with the handgun, they were taken back to the police station and reported to the police chief, who informed all police stations to jointly arrest the escaped kidnappers.</p>
<p>Five Robbers Escape by Jumping Over Roofs</p>
<h3>Wounded Robber Seeks Treatment at Hospital, Gets Arrested</h3>
<p>Wounded Robber Falsely Claims to Be Rickshaw Puller Hit by Stray Bullet</p>
<p>But How Can Rickshaw Puller Wear Woolen Pants and Woolen Socks?</p>
<p>Two People Accompanying Him to Hospital Also Confess to Being Robbers</p>
<p>At 7:10 PM last night, five robbers suddenly came to the home of Zhang Zhenbang, a Ningbo native who runs a leather goods business at No. 3, Fuzhi Lane, No. 344 Beile Road in the French Concession. Three robbers, holding guns, entered the house and first confined everyone inside to the back living room. One robber stood guard with a gun, while the other four went upstairs to search and rob, stealing clothing and silver dollars worth about three hundred yuan. Just as they were about to escape through the door, someone had already secretly reported to the Songshan Road police station. The police chief immediately dispatched two French deputies, along with several detectives, to rush to the scene to arrest them. At that time, the French deputy first entered No. 4 next door. The French deputy turned the doorknob and was peeking into No. 3 when, unexpectedly, the robber on watch heard the police and immediately shouted to the four robbers upstairs to quickly come downstairs. At the same time, he watched the side door. Sure enough, someone opened the door, and he fired a shot at it, hitting the doorpost. The French deputy was shocked and closed the door again. The five robbers knew that there must be people lying in ambush at the front and back doors, so they rushed straight upstairs and fired a shot at the top of the staircase as a warning. When they reached the vicinity of the drying platform, they fired another shot and then jumped over the roofs together to escape. At that time, a Vietnamese constable at the back door saw the robbers jumping over the roofs and quickly aimed and fired a shot. As a result, all five robbers escaped like rabbits. However, at 9:15 PM, a man and a woman suddenly brought a young man with gunshot wounds to Renji Hospital for treatment, claiming that the injured person was a rickshaw puller named Liu Sanrong, 26 years old, from Funing, who had been hit by a stray bullet while pulling a rickshaw near the Great World. The rest of their words were evasive. Because it was a gunshot wound, the hospital, as a matter of routine, notified the police station by telephone. At the same time, the French police station, upon hearing the news, immediately dispatched detectives to investigate, and reporters accompanied them. It was found that the bullet had entered from the right rib and pierced through the back. The injured person was wearing a cotton short jacket, a black lined jacket, a gray cloth shirt, black checkered woolen pants, woolen socks, and rubber overshoes, but the lower part was completely free of mud, not at all like a rickshaw puller. After repeated questioning by the detectives, he continued to evade and deny. Upon closer inspection of the palm of his right hand, there was a fresh scratch mark covered with mud. The detectives concluded that he must be one of the robbers who committed the robbery at the scene, and the scratch on his palm was caused when he jumped over the roof. They then went downstairs and arrested the man and woman who brought him. At the same time, they telegraphed the police chief to order detectives to go to the hospital with the head of the victim's family, his wife, and his eldest son to identify the injured person as one of the five robbers at the scene. The arrested man and woman were taken to the police station. After strict interrogation, they also directly admitted to committing the robbery at the scene.</p>

<p>Wang Boyuan Benefits the Common People: Wang Boyuan, director of the People's Obstetrics Hospital at the intersection of Huade Road, Tilanqiao, Hongkou, has always been compassionate. Because he believes that the old methods of childbirth among the common people are not in line with physiological principles, often resulting in the tragic deaths of both mothers and infants, he has established an obstetrics hospital to provide free childbirth services to benefit the common people. The doctors he has hired, such as Yuan Huiyu and Qian Shuzhen, are all obstetrics experts with skilled surgical skills and are available upon request. The hospital also does not charge fees for common people who are admitted to the wards.

<h3>Rural Bankruptcy and Unemployment Problems</h3>
<p>丨Message from Mr. Wang Taixia of Lianshui丨</p>
<p>I am about to become a starving ghost. I beg you, sir, to point me to a bright way out. I will now describe my situation; I am a rickshaw puller, and there are three people in my family: a disabled father, a mother in her fifties, and myself. My family has more than three mu of land, which is usually cultivated by my mother alone; in my spare time from pulling the rickshaw, I also help her with the work. In recent years, there has been a drought, so these three mu of land are as good as nothing. In the past, I could earn more than one yuan a day pulling the rickshaw; now it is different, because the number of people pulling rickshaws is increasing every day, which has taken away a lot of my business. Now I can't even find a few cents a day; I am already heavily in debt. Now it is even worse, because two cars have been set up in my hometown; the rickshaw route that we usually rely on for a living has now been permanently taken away by them. Because they can carry a person for fifty or sixty li for only fifty cents, and they are fast, running three or four round trips a day. Our rickshaw business is directly gone, because we have to charge at least one yuan to carry a person for fifty or sixty li. We can only do one piece of business a day, and with business being bad now, we can't even rely on finding a piece of business in a few days. My family's life has reached the extreme of hardship, and the three of us can't even eat two meals of porridge a day. And it's not just my family, I'm afraid that most families who make a living by pulling rickshaws are like my family, right? Looking at their car station, money is like water every day, how happy is that?! I can't pull the rickshaw anymore, so I have to go to work as a long-term laborer for someone else; so I found two relatives to help me find a job as a long-term laborer for someone else. After a few days, my relatives came back and replied to me like this: there are no people in the countryside who need long-term laborers now, the servants of the wealthy families are already full, because people who have no land to cultivate due to the recent drought have all gone to work as long-term laborers for other people. Small households don't need people at all. Oh, enlightened sir? Are we just going to starve to death like this? We are almost starving to death now. I can't even find a messenger job in an office, because they are all full, and maybe there are people waiting! Alas! Where am I going? Where am I going to work for whom? What method am I going to use to support my two elderly parents? Knowledgeable reporter, please think of a perfect solution for me!</p>
<p>Answer: Your letter is truly worthy of our praise, because the facts you described reveal the true phenomenon of the current society, which is a picture of the intrusion of capitalism into the countryside, the rapid bankruptcy of the countryside, and the large-scale unemployment of farmers, not only farmers are unemployed, but also the cities cannot accommodate the large number of unemployed people from the countryside, thus becoming the unemployment of workers, etc. This phenomenon is of course universal, not just a problem for you alone, but a universal rural problem in China. If you want to solve your personal problems, you must start with solving the whole problem. In our opinion, to alleviate this panic, there should be at least the following ways: (1) Quickly stand on the side of the interests of the vast majority of farmers and solve the land problem in the countryside from a truly democratic point of view. (2) Those who have no land to cultivate, or who have land but are affected by disasters and have no way to make a living, or unemployed rural workers, should have an organization to gather together to study this problem. (3) With this organization, we can further study the physical causes of floods and droughts in the countryside, such as how to cultivate forests, how to improve agriculture, and at this time, everyone will realize that the so-called floods and droughts are not only due to nature, but in fact half of them are due to the results of a deformed and unequal social system. Therefore, to alleviate the panic in the countryside, we must first solve the farmers' land problem; to solve the land problem, farmers must first have their own organization; with an organization, they will naturally feel that the social system is closely related to the farmers. At that time, you will naturally see the way out ahead. You will naturally be surprised by our reply, saying that the answer is not what you asked. However, besides this kind of reply, we can't think of a "Thousand-Handed, Thousand-Eyed Avalokitesvara Bodhisattva" kind of "rescuing from suffering and difficulties" method.</p>

<h3>Report on the Ministry of Education's Supervisor's Inspection of Education in Jiangxi (Continued)</h3>
<p>12. The aforementioned middle schools are quite attentive to science, and for the sake of preparing students for further studies, they often use original English textbooks in various subjects to seek convenience. In practice, due to language problems, it is inevitable that the progress of the subjects is slowed down. Methods should be immediately taken to use Chinese textbooks, focusing on specialized terminology in various subjects to seek practicality.</p>
<p>13. The various middle schools still do not pay enough attention to physical education and military training, resulting in students having no habit of exercise. There are not many types of extracurricular activities, and guidance is also inadequate.</p>
<p>14. The majority of private middle schools have simple buildings and equipment, lax teaching, and the quality of students seems to be lacking. They should be banned. The provincial normal school has a good environment and is well-managed.</p>
<p>15. Public and private elementary schools, with the exception of the provincial capital's experimental elementary school, kindergarten, girls' middle school experimental elementary school, and one or three church elementary schools, have overly simple equipment and unclean school buildings. Children have mostly not developed clean habits. The classroom floors are full of light snot and scraps of paper, and the desks, chairs, and walls are covered in chalk, which is unsightly. Strict training should be given to pay attention to school and personal hygiene.</p>
<p>16. Teaching methods are biased towards rote learning, and textbooks are used rigidly. There are no specimens, models, instruments, or other items to assist, and there are no opportunities for on-site observation and experimentation. Therefore, children have no concept of nature other than the words in books.</p>
<p>17. The layout of lighting and the height of desks and chairs in various elementary schools mostly fail to meet the principles of education. Teachers' lecturing tones are too loud, which interferes with the coursework in other classrooms.</p>
<p>18. Most school labor practices are limited to gardening and cooperative societies, with ordinary results. Children also lack a clear understanding of the meaning of cooperative societies. Labor activities should be increased, and teachers should provide practical guidance.</p>
<p>19. The preparation and content of statistical charts and graphs in various schools are mostly lacking in refinement. They are often overly artistic and lose the meaning of the charts and graphs.</p>
<p>20. The public education museum's location is too small, and the branch reading rooms are mostly simple and not suitable for public reading. Although there are many items on display in the exhibition halls, there are not many that are fresh, eye-catching, and arranged neatly and legally. Among them, the students' grade products are the most outdated and should be collected and added at any time to arouse the interest of the audience.</p>
<p>21. The Jiangxi Province's education funding of over two million yuan per year seems to be excessive for elementary schools and scholarship subsidies and insufficient for social education. It should be redistributed according to needs to seek balanced development. At the same time, the funding for local education is only over eight hundred thousand yuan, which is far from enough.</p>
<p>22. There are too many ordinary middle schools, which cannot meet the actual needs. Subsidies should be stopped for private schools that are poorly managed, and they should be ordered to close. The Department of Education must formulate an overall plan to add or convert vocational schools in stages.</p>
<p>23. Various levels of schools fail to effectively conduct physical and mental cultivation and youth guidance. Attention should be paid to avoid young people being affected by a bad environment and falling into the realm of dangerous thoughts and behaviors.</p>
<p>24. After the Department of Education strictly prohibited teachers at all levels from taking part-time jobs last year, the majority of teachers are now full-time, and their teaching spirit is also better than before, which can serve as a model for other provinces.</p>

The meeting ended joyfully at over 9:00 AM. The school also took a day off according to the school calendar.

<h3>Nanyang Commerce School Defeats Chih Chih Again</h3>
<p>Jinan University wins both men's and women's matches against Shanghai High School</p>
<p>Three matches this afternoon</p>
<p>The Shanghai Middle School Basketball League had three matches yesterday, including men's and women's matches. The women's team of Jinan University has strong strength, and Shanghai High School was no match for them, consistently falling behind. The men's match between Jinan University and Shanghai High School was quite intense, but Shanghai High School was ultimately unable to withstand the strong Jinan University team due to their smaller size. The strength difference between Nanyang Commerce School and Chih Chih was significant, and Chih Chih consistently succumbed with no chance of winning. The results of the three matches are listed below.</p>

<h3>The Six Gentlemen</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>丨丨Everyone is making much ado about nothing丨丨</p>
<p>The six English gentlemen, stirring up trouble in Soviet Russia, were to be charged with counter-revolutionary crimes by the Soviets—impartial and without bias, one bullet for each. This greatly alarmed England, which hastily issued a protest. Of course, England's protest was one hundred and twenty-four times more impressive than China's "responsibility lies with your country" tune. Unexpectedly, the protest hit a rubber nail in Soviet Russia, resulting in a nose-bruising encounter, as the protest proved ineffective. The case of these six gentlemen has unexpectedly stirred great emotion within me.</p>
<p>As I, an ignoramus, understand it, a counter-revolutionary invariably schemes to overthrow the government of the country in which they reside. I recall that a couple of unknown nationality established a base in Shanghai a few years ago, spreading communism, inciting labor unrest, organizing worker-peasant armies, and plotting to subvert the Chinese government to create a Soviet regime. Ironclad evidence was presented, and they were caught red-handed. If such a thing were to happen in another country, humph, needless to say, fifty pairs out of a hundred would have been killed. But China, with the magnanimity of a prime minister who can sail a boat even in his belly and a magistrate who shows leniency in his writings, sentenced them to life imprisonment, allowing them to live out their days as machines digesting milk and bread. In the end, China maintained its great-nation demeanor, and did not hold petty grievances against small people. England, because Soviet Russia was about to punish the six gentlemen, considered the matter grave and international relations strained. In my opinion, this is making a mountain out of a molehill. Why? Well, Chinese expatriates in Japan and Korea are treated in the same way as English expatriates in Russia—no extraterritoriality. Therefore, when our Chinese compatriots commit crimes under Japanese jurisdiction, the Japanese kill Chinese people without asking questions, and the Chinese have no resentment for the deaths. Even Koreans and Taiwanese who have naturalized and live in Shanghai are often arrested and punished by the Japanese. Has China ever turned blue in the face, or have Sino-Japanese relations ever been strained? This alone is enough to show that China does not like to cause trouble and is not as afraid of peace as others.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Morning Talk</h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>丨The Three Sights of Dawn for the Early Morning Watchman丨</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Ruogu wrote several "Shanghai Night Talks." It seems that Mr. Zhang leads a "nightingale life," so he has a lot of material for night talks. I, on the other hand, am an "early morning watchman" all year round. By the time Mr. Zhang is yawning and putting his head on the pillow, I am already yawning, preparing to hobble around and inspect the streets. So, after reading "Shanghai Night Talks," I feel itchy and want to try a "Shanghai Morning Talk."</p>
<p>Those who live the same life as I do are the silk factory workers. No matter where I go, there are always several of them walking along, carrying small lunch baskets, chattering like orioles and swallows. I glance at them, and they also look at me with sympathy, perhaps silently singing in their hearts, "Fate, a chance encounter..." Although I have never asked them their names, whether they are Sister Azhao or Sister Aqiao.</p>
<p>Standing under the eaves at the corner of the street is the "police officer." When you walk past him, he will suddenly stir in the darkness and give you a big fright. So, when I walk past such places, I always pretend to cough three steps away as a signal. The "police officer" is startled first, then straightens up and salutes me. This is called preemptive strike.</p>
<p>The early market on Wangping Street, I'm not lying, is three minutes earlier than the one at the Sixteen Pups. Every morning when I pass Wangping Street, old men, women with bound feet, young girls, and children, all kinds of newspaper vendors are carrying bags, looking like they are going on a pilgrimage. And their spirit of vying for the lead is like the big knife team of the 19th Route Army. Once they get the newspapers, the way they squat on the terrazzo and fold and distribute them, I don't know what to call it, so I call it calmly preparing for battle.</p>
<p>These are the three sights of dawn in Shanghai, which are not easily appreciated by Shanghainese people. In addition, the dim, sleepy lights, the rickshaw pullers with hunched heads and necks, and the homeless sleeping under the overhanging buildings can only be seen by the "early morning watchmen." As for dumping chamber pots and vegetable markets, these things always happen after dawn, lagging behind.</p>
<h3>Modern Conversation</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ziming</p>
<p>(A) Nowadays, so-called modern women can't do anything practically.</p>
<p>(B) Why do you say that?</p>
<p>(A) Look! They wear high heels, and when they walk, they always walk on their toes. Isn't that ironclad proof?</p>
<p>(B) I say that nowadays, so-called modern men are all slippery.</p>
<p>(A) Why do you say that, too?</p>
<p>(B) Look! Their mustaches are coated with Stancon until they gleam. Flies will slip if they fly on it. Isn't that proof that they're slippery?</p>
<p>(A, B) Haha, modern men and women, so that's how it is?!</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>The Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Two: Dark Thoughts in a Humble Room, Zheng Secretly Admires the Robust Old Man; Choosing a Good Match, Bitterly Criticizing the Poor Girl</p>
<p>He's getting on in years and should settle down with a wife. Whether she's traditional or modern, we as his elder brother and sister-in-law shouldn't object. But how could he have fallen for a working girl? That girl has only a widowed mother, and their family is so poor that they only have an earthen bed left. If he gets too close to her, it's bound to lead to jokes. Just now, he borrowed the excuse of delivering clothes and came into the yard. I told him Jingzhi wasn't home and sent him away. While Mrs. Gan sorted through the clothes, she listened to her husband's words. At this point, her face darkened, and she kept looking at the trunk but raised her voice, saying, "This is only the fault of our own people, not others. You should call Jingzhi and give him a good scolding. That girl helps me with my work, and sometimes she doesn't even ask for money. She's a good person. As long as Jingzhi doesn't tempt her, she won't be embarrassed to keep coming." Houzhi thought what she said was reasonable. He put a cigarette in his mouth, put his hands behind his back, and walked towards Jingzhi's room. Jingzhi had already put the newly made robe over his cotton gown, intending to go out. He bumped into his older brother and thought he could show off his frugality, so he smiled and said, "I've also put on a blue cloth gown." Houzhi coldly said, "You shouldn't just focus on appearances when you do things. Does wearing a blue cloth gown make someone a thrifty person?" Because Jingzhi relied on his older brother's influence to get a job at the River Conservancy Bureau, he didn't dare to disobey his brother's words, so he blushed and stood to the side, saying nothing. Houzhi straightened his face and said, "I know you don't care about the clothes themselves, but about the person who made them. When you're working outside, you need to maintain your status. Confucius said that a gentleman without dignity is not imposing. We may not be a very noble family, but our friends are all respectable. Just take your sister-in-law's family as an example. What kind of people are they? You're so hopeless, getting so close to a working girl, coming and going, being very affectionate. I can't believe you have the nerve to keep running to her house. I heard that her family is so poor that they only have a bare earthen bed, and the house is as dark as a dungeon. What do you mean by running to her house all the time? If people see you, how can you face them?" (21)</p>
<h3>The Training of Speech Summer</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>丨It's a pity the person is already dead, it just got added in!丨</p>
<p>A friend of mine once asked me: Why don't you like to talk more? At first, I wondered why he asked me this, but a flash of inspiration told me that my speech had never offended him, and he often laughed when he heard my words. After he asked me this, I felt somewhat fortunate for myself, knowing that I used to talk to him a lot, but fortunately I never clashed with him. I also knew that I was indeed willing to talk less.</p>
<p>If one is blessed by nature to not like talking much, or if one has gained the skill through training, such a person should always be fortunate. My intention is not to call you to refute me, "Then everyone should become a mute." Mutes, of course, are different from people who can speak. If everyone were a mute, I wouldn't speak either, and no one would find the term "mute" to contrast with my speech. Before everyone becomes a mute, those who speak less should always be fortunate.</p>
<p>Even when the "mute" is still an uncommon reality, a person who can speak pretending to be a mute is ultimately more useful than the many senseless things of unfinished poetry or the showing off of a self-braggart. Even if one is ridiculed, it's still cheaper by comparison, speaking scientifically.</p>
<p>The best thing is that, as a Chinese citizen, one should have training in speech. We are a famous ancient country with flourishing culture and education. You shouldn't be an unlucky person who steps into a teahouse or wine shop and faces "No discussion of state affairs." Ancient poetry says: "Each person sweeps the snow from their own doorstep, don't mind the frost on others' roofs." The sage's words: "Prudent self-preservation." You should know the background of these sayings. Your motives are good, your attitude is bright, your reasons are sufficient. But, but the world will have an opposite side, and you will receive an unexpectedly distant answer representing another truth.</p>
<p>If you want to walk the path of luck, remember to turn your speech into a circle, be careful to keep a taboo mentality, your mentality must forget this era and must retreat to the autocratic era, just like avoiding the "sage's name" in the autocratic era. For example, if the person across from you likes to smoke opium, you must not reveal any accent that mentions the harm of opium, and of course, don't talk about Lin Zexu in a disjointed way: when you see him engrossed in inhaling clouds and spitting mist, with a leisurely will, you should praise the efficacy of opium; you say that opium can stop abdominal pain and diarrhea, and can clear the mind and refresh the spirit, which is to implement one's own claim and win the favor of the listener.</p>
<p>Please admit it, because in the world I have never seen someone use a disdainful look to receive the flattery of others, and listen with a natural smile to the well-intentioned missed criticisms of others. In foreign countries, there are many famous movie stars who may show such wonderful expressions on the screen, but it's a pity that the flashes are fleeting, and it's not clear to see. It seems that articles like "The Inheritance of the Great Man" have also seen very good literary descriptions, but it's a pity that the person is already dead!</p>

<h3>Proposal for an Open University (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yizeng</p>
<p>Now, let's take an example to illustrate the organization of each department. Suppose we invite Mr. Ma Yinchu to be the director of the Economics Department, giving lectures on Banking from 8:00 AM to 9:00 AM. The so-called lecture is to broadcast the lecture using a lecture film, and Professor Ma does not have to be present in person. From 9:00 AM to 10:00 AM is Principles of Economics, from 10:00 AM to 11:00 AM is Accounting, from 11:00 AM to 12:00 PM is Statistics, from 1:00 PM to 2:00 PM is International Trade, from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM is Commercial Law, from 3:00 PM to 4:00 PM is Economic Organization, from 4:00 PM to 5:00 PM is Labor Issues, from 5:00 PM to 6:00 PM is Commercial History, from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM is Commercial Credit Issues, from 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM is Foreign Exchange, from 8:00 PM to 9:00 PM is Economic Issues, and from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM is Economic Overview. Every day, the Economics Department's radio station can invite an experienced businessman to report on the daily commercial situation. This is the Economics Department's broadcasting station. If there are new academic theories, experts can be invited to the station to give lectures. In addition, we can set up a Department of Chinese Studies, a Department of English Studies, a Department of Philosophy, a Department of Law, a Department of Education, a Department of Psychology, etc. As for science, which emphasizes experimentation, we can assume that students attend lectures every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and go to the Public Education Center to experiment on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, with teaching assistants guiding everything. All students who experiment must pay a deposit to compensate for damage to equipment in the laboratory. Last year, Mr. Wu Yunfu donated several free academic places in the field of chemistry, and many people took the exam, which shows that there are indeed many people in China who are eager to learn. The number of students admitted was very small, but with the Open University, wouldn't all these eager-to-learn students be able to study? As for students studying engineering, they can imitate the Cincinnati University's six-week study, six-week internship, and the method of internship is even more appropriate.</p>
<p>As for the examination, we can imitate the British degree examination. Before the examination, each student must have a general examination, such as Chinese, English, and Mathematics. Only those who pass the general examination can be allowed to take the degree examination. Those who fail the general examination cannot join the degree examination. The degree examination requires testing everything from beginning to end in a department. For those who study philosophy, everything related to philosophy itself and all courses related to philosophy must be tested. If this is done, the diploma of the Open University will be valuable. Someone may also ask, "After the Open University is established, won't all the existing public and private universities have to close?" I say no. There are still those with family assets who want to enjoy the scenery of the university, while the Ministry of Education can try its best to ban business-style universities. A classmate of mine graduated from a university in Shanghai, and the title of bachelor was engraved on his name card. I talked with him for a moment and realized that this is what a university student is. Another university student is a Bachelor of Arts, but what he says and writes cannot be understood by foreigners. I asked him how he was able to graduate. He said, "The school is fuzzy, and so am I." In the past, someone also asked, "After the Open University is established, won't the professors lose their jobs?" I say no. The money from opening the school can be used to open middle schools and elementary schools, and the professors can be invited to be principals and teachers, so that they can also have a place to live.</p>
<p>Internal strife and foreign troubles will pass sooner or later. Only schools run by the Chinese themselves can cultivate talent for China's construction. Schools run by foreigners are not up to the task. Is there any foreigner who is truly and sincerely helping China? What they do is mostly for their own interests. Chinese people, quickly get up and run on the road to construction. Those with money should use money to build, those with strength should use strength to save the country, and those with knowledge should work hard in knowledge. With the thousands of years of glory of our China, there may be a possibility of revival in this time of hardship. (If you have any comments, please send them to China Post Office Box 702.)</p>

<h3>Literature of Stanching Cries</h3>
<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>Three years ago, when the "Nationalist Literature" proponents were banging gongs and drums, an article titled "The Blood of the Yellow Race" stated their highest aspiration was to follow in the footsteps of Batu Khan, grandson of Genghis Khan, to annihilate "the Oros." The Oros are the current Soviet Russia. At that time, some people pointed out that the current Batu's army is the Japanese army, and before "the Western Expedition," they must first conquer China and turn it into a slave to the army.</p>
<p>When we are conquered ourselves, it is very painful for all but a few people. This is exemplified by the loss of the three northeastern provinces and the bombings of Shanghai. Among all living people, there are very few who are not sad and indignant. But this sorrow and indignation greatly hinders the future "Western Expedition." Thus came "The Destruction of Greater Shanghai," which used numbers to tell readers that China's military force was definitely not as good as Japan's, to calm everyone down; and believed that it was better to die than to live ("The death of the 19th Route Army is a warning that we live miserably, without interest!"), but that defeat was even better than victory ("The victory of the 19th Route Army can only increase our complacency, complacency, and pride!"). In short, it is good to die in battle, but it is especially good to be defeated. The Battle of Shanghai was a complete success for China.</p>
<p>Now the second step has begun. According to Central News Agency reports, Japan has a conspiracy to sign a "Commonwealth of China Empire Secret Agreement" with Manchuria. The first article of that plan is: "There are only two types of countries in the world now, one is capitalist, England, America, Japan, Italy, France, and the other is communist, Soviet Russia. Now to resist Soviet Russia, Sino-Japanese alliance… is the only way to succeed" (see Shen Bao, March 19).</p>
<p>They want to "ally." This time it is a complete success for China and Japan, the second step in moving from "The Destruction of Greater Shanghai" to the road of "Blood of the Yellow Race."</p>
<p>Of course, some places are being bombed, but Shanghai, since being bombed, has had more than a year, but some people do not realize the inevitable steps of the "Western Expedition," and it seems that they have not completely forgotten the sorrow and indignation of the previous year. This sorrow and indignation greatly hinders the current "alliance." In this situation, what is born in response is to give people a little refreshment and consolation, like the literature of "chili and olives." This may be a cure for depression. Why? Because "chili is spicy, but it won't kill you, olives are bitter, but there is a taste in the bitterness." Understanding this, one will know why coolies smoke opium.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not only silent depression, but it is also said that chili can even stop "annoying cries." Mr. Wang Ci tells us in his famous article "Advocating Chili to Save the Country"!</p>
<p>"...Also, when northerners are in their mothers' arms, when they cry loudly, if the mother gives the child a spicy eggplant to bite, it can be very effective in stopping the crying immediately...</p>
<p>"The current China is like a northern baby crying loudly. If you want to stop his annoying cries, you only need to give him more spicy eggplants to bite." (Da Wan Bao Supplement No. 12)</p>
<p>Chili can stop a child's loud crying, which is unprecedented news. If it is true, then the Chinese are indeed a special "nation" different from others. However, it is also very clear to see that the intention of this "literature" is to give people a spice that will not kill them, "stop his annoying cries," and wait for Batu Khan.</p>
<p>However, this is ineffective, far less effective than "summary execution" for those who cry. What we need to guard against from now on is "exchanging glances on the road." We are waiting for literature that blinds the eyes.</p>
<h3>"Mad Torrent" and "City Night"</h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>The Mingxing and Lianhua film companies have both recently announced a "change in style." Mingxing's "Mad Torrent" and Lianhua's "City Night" are the latest representative works of the two companies.</p>
<p>Technically, because "Mad Torrent" takes the great flood of the previous year as its theme, and mainly focuses on mass struggle, it is not as easy to show off skill as "City Night," which mainly focuses on depicting the dark side of the city. If "City Night" is more popular with urban audiences, the reason may lie in this.</p>
<p>As for the content, if we only look at the descriptions of these two films, we may still feel that "City Night" is better (the description is really novel); but after watching it and thinking carefully, our opinion is different. "Mad Torrent" intersperses a love romance, with the daughter of a local tyrant falling in love with a village teacher who is a peasant leader; "City Night" also has a similar romance, with the son of a capitalist falling in love with a female worker. Both similarly express the struggle between "father and son" in the midst of love. However, these two romances are essentially different. In "Mad Torrent," what ignites the passion of the tyrant's daughter is the brave and bright personality of the other person; but in "City Night," what arouses the love of the capitalist's son is what? Judging from the plot, it is only shallow humanitarianism, or even the so-called mysterious and inexplicable love. The ending of "Mad Torrent," where the tyrant does not die from the anger of the masses, but from the flood, inevitably still has the feudal stench of "the net of heaven is vast"; but the ending of "City Night" puts forward the slogan of "going to the countryside to create a new life," which is seemingly true but actually false. Because rural bankruptcy is now an ironclad fact, the countryside is not a paradise!</p>
<p>The fact is that the countryside went bankrupt first, so the peasants left. The strong social reform policy inclination in "City Night" made the film drag out the slogan "go to the countryside" at the end, but it reversed the cause and effect of social phenomena, making the depiction of urban darkness in the entire film lose its meaning! It is precisely on this point that the essential differences in the meaning of "Mad Torrent" and "City Night" lie! Although "Mad Torrent" still has some shortcomings, it is still a film that exposes the darkness of society.</p>
<h3>Letter from Mr. Liu Zongyuan</h3>
<p>To Mr. Hu Huaichen, Editor of Free Talk: I have seen the two letters you published in Shen Bao and the article published in Min Bao. In your first letter, you seem to admit your mistake, and I admire your frankness. In your second letter, you say that because my article was not well written, it made you misunderstand. I can also admit this. My article may indeed be badly written because it is impossible to learn from the ancients well. However, the reason why my article was written that way was precisely because of the two intentions you mentioned: (1) the same noun is used too many times; (2) the same noun is too close together. Consider</p>
<p>(1) If I had written my first sentence honestly, it would have been: The mountain of Stone Fish. All stone. No large vegetation. The mountain is small and high, its shape like a standing fish, located west of Xian Yi, with a cave similar to Xian Yi.</p>
<p>There are two repetitions of "Xian Yi." Consider again</p>
<p>(2) If I had written my second sentence honestly, it would have been:</p>
<p>Huangxi is seventy li from the prefectural seat. Go six hundred steps south from Dongtun to Huangshen Temple. Above Huangshen Temple, two mountain walls stand...Above Huangshen Temple, Jieshui is eighty steps...</p>
<p>There are three repetitions of "Huangshen Temple." Therefore, I thought I should vary the style. In the first sentence, I used "Duo Zigui" to replace one of the "Xian Yi" characters, resulting in:</p>
<p>The mountain of Stone Fish, all stone, no large vegetation. The mountain is small and high, its shape like a standing fish, located west of Duo Zigui, with a cave similar to Xian Yi.</p>
<p>In the second sentence, I omitted the second and third instances of "Huangshen Temple." In the second instance of "Huangshen Temple," I omitted "Huangshen," leaving only the character "Temple"; in the third instance of "Huangshen Temple," I kept "Huangshen," omitting "Temple," resulting in: Huangxi is seventy li from the prefectural seat. Go six hundred steps south from Dongtun to Huangshen Temple. Above the Temple, two mountain walls stand...Above Huangshen, Jieshui is eighty steps...</p>
<p>This is the style I came up with. My style may not be well done, but I did change it this way. I hope you acknowledge this. You say that I didn't learn well from the ancients, which made you misunderstand, and this may be true, but it is also true that you misunderstood my article. Therefore, let's just cancel out the apology.</p>
<p>Liu Zongyuan (March 22nd) Editor's note: From Mr. Liu's letter, we can learn a small lesson, which is: blindly imitating the ancients is indeed not feasible. Because Mr. Liu imitated the "Classic of Mountains and Seas," he stubbornly changed his article with many unnecessary variations, causing Mr. Hu to misinterpret it and make some jokes, and also bothering Mr. Liu to personally point it out, wasting a lot of energy. What a pity! However, Mr. Liu's poor imitation of the ancients is one thing, and Mr. Hu's misunderstanding of Mr. Liu's article is another. Mr. Liu is not only not annoyed that his article was misunderstood, but also admits that he should not have imitated the ancients, which shows the ancient people's "modesty" and "willingness to accept good advice."</p>
<h3>Parisian Chats</h3>
<p>— Xiao Shijun, sent from Paris</p>
<p>(VII) Maeterlinck's Tragi-Comedy</p>
<p>Maeterlinck's name is known to many in the motherland. He is not only a great Belgian playwright, but also one of the most successful figures in the new romantic drama of the twentieth century. However, he himself also starred in a tragicomedy. We only learned a rough idea after Mrs. Georgette Leblanc published a memoir a couple of years ago. Last year, a friend, Gerand Harry, wrote a book called "The Life and Works of Maurice Maeterlinck" (La Vie et laeuvre de Maurice Macterlinck), a chapter of which also mentions this tragicomedy. The matter is as follows: In 1895, Maeterlinck met Mrs. Leblanc, a famous actress who admired him. Although he was thirty-four years old at the time, he had not yet formally married any other woman. Leblanc admired him very much, and he also loved Leblanc very much. Soon, they realized their plan to live together. Maeterlinck's early works were very pessimistic, such as "Princess Maleine," "The Intruder," "The Blind," and "Interior," all of which expressed terror of death and the mystery of fate. After living with Leblanc, "Aglavaine and Sélysette," published the following year, and "Monna Vanna" in 1902, changed from pessimism to optimism. Critics said that Maeterlinck underwent a transformation in his inner life because he lived with Leblanc. When they lived together, Mrs. Leblanc was just twenty years old. We can now see her admiration for Maeterlinck and Maeterlinck's love for her from the correspondence between the two excerpted in Mrs. Leblanc's "Memoirs." However, their friendship officially broke down in 1919 because Maeterlinck officially married a young woman who performed in the play with Mrs. Leblanc that year.</p>
<p>Mrs. Leblanc was born in Rouen. Her family was quite well-off. Her father was the manager of a shipping company. Because he was rich, he loved to collect antiques. Her brother was very fond of literature and art, and had written some novels. He had a great influence on her. The literary books that Mrs. Leblanc read as a child were all bought for her by her brother. He was the first to hear the name Maeterlinck from his mouth. He originally loved to read Maeterlinck's works. He told her that some people called Maeterlinck the Shakespeare of Belgium. So later, when Mrs. Leblanc went to the Belgian capital to perform, she wanted to find an opportunity to meet Maeterlinck. Finally, she saw Maeterlinck at the home of a famous lawyer. As soon as others announced Maeterlinck's name, she couldn't help but exclaim, "What a blessing, he is still so young!" Because before she met Maeterlinck, the famous lawyer, seeing that she was so infatuated with Maeterlinck, deliberately joked with her, saying, "You don't know, he is already an old man." Mrs. Leblanc immediately replied, "I don't care, he is my God."</p>
<p>According to her "Memoirs," her mother died when she was sixteen years old. After her mother's death, her father often lost his temper at home because of mourning. She was bored and eager to make an engagement with someone so that she could leave this depressing family. So she made a confused engagement with a Spanish boy. After the engagement, she discovered many bad things about this boy. Her father asked him to dissolve the engagement. This boy therefore committed suicide by taking poison. Harry, however, says that her husband was an adventurer, and because of other matters, he had to hide, and although it could be guessed that he was dead, there was no proof of death. In front of the law, she could not dissolve the engagement. The reason why she lived with Maeterlinck for twenty years without officially announcing her marriage to Maeterlinck was this.

<h3>The Crossroads of Time and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Guanping</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, don't treat me like a country bumpkin! This is terrible, Mr. Lin!"</p>
<p>She made a face at him again, followed by a charming smile.</p>
<p>"That's not what I meant. Because I only found out about this kind of thing just now, a professor told me."</p>
<p>"Then, Mr. Lin is a country bumpkin. Haha. I'll try it and see if it tastes good."</p>
<p>She unpacked a package, took out a piece, and immediately put it in her mouth.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, do you know that Westerners eat chewing gum before kissing?"</p>
<p>She said with a smile again. A little white foam flowed from her lips. Her impolite attitude caused some disgust in him.</p>
<p>"…………………………………………"</p>
<p>Haiquan just smiled and shook his head. At the same time, he secretly regretted that he missed the opportunity yesterday and did not kiss Mrs. Hezi. When he was sitting in the car, why didn't he try the taste of kissing the opposite sex?</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, eat more, good K…i…ss!" She said, lowering her head.</p>
<p>"I don't have a target!"</p>
<p>He felt his cheeks were heating up, and he also smiled.</p>
<p>"Don't lie to me, Mr. Lin! Who doesn't know you have a lover! Tell me, what kind of beauty is your Sweet heart?…"</p>
<p>Haiquan thought, that's right, Cao Shiguang must have told his wife about seeing Mrs. Hezi in Zhaofeng Park yesterday.</p>
<p>"There's no such thing. There really isn't."</p>
<p>"Fortunately, someone saw it."</p>

<h3>Financial and Exchange Markets Harden</h3>
<h3>Bullion Speculation Rebound Power Not Small</h3>
<p>Crashed 23.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Retreated to within the 60 Yuan Mark</p>
<p>The Brokers Association Passes Many Important Cases</p>
<p>The gold market rebounded again yesterday, with a considerable decline. In the early morning, foreign telegrams indicated that both near and far-term contracts in London were unchanged. The New York silver price only shrunk by 0.125, which was not satisfactory. In addition, the forward silver market suddenly saw a sharp rise of more than 0.09, and American cotton still rose by 8 pounds. The British-American and American-British exchange rates both fell slightly by 0.025. The opening price of the gold market immediately dropped to 1067.5 yuan, and the opening price of the exchange market also hardened, but not by much. Initially, the banks tried hard to cover forward American exchange rates. McGalli bought July American exchange rates at 30.0625 yuan, once rising to 1073.5 yuan before stopping. HSBC's listed exchange rates for shillings and American dollars both increased by 0.025, and the exchange market also loosened. July American dollars were difficult to sell at 1.25, and fell to within 70 yuan, but there was still some fluctuation. Later, the exchange market became extremely hard, and the banks' appetite decreased. July American dollars were done from 1.875 to 3.125 yuan, and it was still difficult to find buyers, so it fell to 62 yuan, and then stabilized. The banks accepted the price of 3.125 yuan for July American dollars, and it rebounded to 8 yuan. However, as it approached the close, the banks did not have better transactions. The midday closing price still retreated to 1065.2 yuan. Initially, the after-market was still calm, with the opening price at 1065 yuan. Many banks covered July American dollars at 30.3125 yuan, and added to 8.7 yuan. Gradually, due to reports of increases in Mumbai, the exchange market tended to harden and retreat step by step, but the decline was mostly fluctuating. Finally, the banks' appetite was extremely weak, and even 4.375 yuan for July American dollars were difficult to sell, gradually retreating to within the 60 yuan mark, reaching 1058.8 yuan, with extremely weak confidence and a poor environment. The Brokers Association held a plenary meeting the afternoon before yesterday (Wednesday) and passed many important cases. The more important ones, such as implementing the disclosure of contract amounts and the long and short positions of each firm, and the payment of margin deposits have also been stipulated in detail. If the American exchange rate is listed, what exchange rate should be used as the standard after the HSBC bank stops announcing, etc., have all been discussed and decided, and have been submitted to the board of directors for implementation. As for the exchange's request to increase commissions, it has been politely rejected by the general meeting. The premium for refined silver in this city is still increased by 37 yuan, but the formal transaction is 40 yuan, and the four or five-month swap is 28 yuan. The daily market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 1067.5 yuan, a drop of 15.3 yuan from the previous close.

After the close, goods sold contracts, and continued to decline to within 8.5 yuan, Hengxing then came to cover at a low price, still at around 9 yuan, the auction price of goods was slightly pressed to 8.5 yuan. Checking the highest price of the day at 1073.5 yuan, and the lowest price at 1058.8 yuan, there was a fluctuation of 14.7 yuan, and the result was a decline of 23.5 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listing price was 0.025 higher due to HSBC's listed American dollars, totaling 28.75 yuan, the alloy price was over 1159 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 99.8 yuan, a press of more than 13 yuan compared to the previous close. The amount registered this month was 1094 yuan, the same as April, and May was 1065 yuan. The morning supplement was 1089 yuan, and the afternoon was 1083 yuan.</p>

The opening price of the near-term British exchange rate was 1 shilling and 8.5 pence, an increase of 0.1875 compared to the previous close. Although the New York silver price contracted by 0.125, it was not satisfactory. In addition, the forward silver price on the Five Metals Exchange suddenly saw a sharp rise of 0.0911, and the base was extremely hard, and American cotton also rose by 8 pounds. The opening price of the near-term American exchange rate was 29.25 yuan, an increase of 0.025 compared to the previous close.

At this time, July American dollars at 1.25 were still between entry and exit, and gradually tended to loosen later, and the market conditions changed greatly. The banks' appetite was slightly dull at this point, and the gold industry, which was originally trying to cover forward prices, now sold off even more urgently. July American dollars loosened to 3.125 and there were no takers. It calmed down slightly near the midday close. After the after-market opened, it was flat, and there were quite a few banks accepting July American dollars at 30.3125. Initially, it had the same problem as the previous market. Initially, because Mumbai reported an increase of 0.09, the gold market tended to decline, and the exchange market showed slight weakness, but June American dollars at 3.375 still had takers, and it was even more weak near the close.

<h3>The Silver Dollar Market: A Hesitant Advance and Retreat</h3>
<p>This year, due to the difficulties of the times, the increasing foreign aggression, the decline of commerce, and the hardship of the people's livelihood, the financial adjustment in the market has been greatly uneven. This spring season, which is the time for business to flourish, has ultimately seen the power of financial circulation fall into the hands of the silver and money industry. However, cash is concentrated and cannot flow smoothly, leading to a state of advance and retreat in the market. The atmosphere was quite good a few days ago, but yesterday stagnation reappeared. The interest rate difference between silver dollars was six percent in both the morning and afternoon markets, the same as the previous day. The "劃頭加水" (a type of financial instrument) was much looser, only two or three percent. The amount of remittance drafts made in the market was 150,000 in the morning market and 658,000 in the afternoon market. There were still no transactions in banknotes. The volume of debit notes traded was 125,000 in the morning market and 210,000 in the afternoon market. The volume of "拆票" (another type of financial instrument) traded was a total of 2.45 million in the morning and afternoon markets and in the small general association. The amount of silver traded was more than 3.5 million in the morning market, more than 300,000 in the afternoon market, and more than 400,000 in the small general association. The amount of silver pledged was more than 600,000. The amount of silver received by banks was slightly less than 2 million, and the amount of miscellaneous expenses was more than 1.2 million. The amount of customs duties received in silver was 5-600,000. The amount of silver received from foreign merchants was 7.89 million, and from Chinese merchants was 6.89 million, with 900,000 going out of the warehouse. The amount of silver received by money houses and silver firms was more than 19 million. The amount of silver received by the public was more than 8.3 million.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>Public Bonds: Stronger in the Near Term, Weaker in the Long Term</h3>
<p>| Delivery Period Approaching, Some Covering of Short Positions in the Current Month |</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, public bonds continued to rise, presumably because the war was calm, the situation in Tianjin has calmed down, and there are only 24 days left for futures trading in the current month. There is a gradual increase in short covering in the market, and there are also many bulls swapping positions. At the same time, large traders, designated as "32," are quite active. However, because the demand is strong, they have been unable to suppress the price. In the absence of changes in this environment, the time for the bulls and bears to test each other's strength is approaching. A close contest is likely to involve fierce competition. Yesterday's trading saw stronger gains in the spot market, with various bonds rising by about 3-4 "角" to 7-8 "角." Although the selling pressure from "32" was quite heavy, it was still insufficient to meet the demand. In the secondary market, the bulls swapped positions due to the favorable prices in the near and distant markets. "32" also sold off some positions. Market prices have gradually weakened since the troop reduction in April, by a small 3-4 "角." However, the short position in salt tax was quite large, and there was a gradual influx of buying from the Northern faction and scattered individuals, so the market price rebounded by 2-3 "角." In the afternoon, the activity of "32" decreased, and the price continued to rise by 2-3 "角." At the close, the bulls still swapped positions, returning a small 2-3 "角." Only the salt tax in April rose slightly by 2 "角" due to continued buying from the Northern faction. As a result, except for "金長" which fell by 3 "角," the rest all rose by 3-4 "角" to 5-6 "角." The magnitude of the increase was stronger in the near term and weaker in the long term. The total trading volume was 8,449,000 yuan, of which 4,000 yuan was in the spot market. The three types of futures, troop reduction and unified salt tax, accounted for 4,775,000 yuan. The "19 關" and "20 關" each accounted for 860,000 yuan. The "19 善" and "20 捲" each accounted for more than 700,000 yuan. "編遣" accounted for slightly more than 300,000 yuan. "18 關" and "整六," "96," and "金長" together accounted for 155,000 yuan. The market announced that April 3, 4, and 5 would be Arbor Day, with three days of closure.</p>

<h3>The Downturn in Cotton Yarn Eases Slightly</h3>
<p>The yarn market saw a decline in the morning and a rise in the afternoon, but the overall situation remained flat. However, after many days of continuous decline, some profit-takers took the opportunity to cover their positions, but actual demand remained sluggish.

<h3>Human Bidding: A Squeeze</h3>
<p>The pre-market opening for human bidding saw flat U.S. cotton, and the market atmosphere remained weak. Prices for all months fell by 1, 2, 3, and 5 "錢." The afternoon opening remained soft.

<h3>Grains: River Rice Continues to Fall, Approximately a Corner</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from the river. Due to the heavy rain, few customers visited the urban and rural stores, so the market was weak and prices fell by approximately a corner. The "包胃" (large rice dealers) moved more than a thousand names (units). The market for thin rice remained relatively stable, but inferior goods also weakened by approximately a corner. Yinbianyuan and Duyangjian showed signs of slackness, and prices softened by 5 "分" to approximately a corner.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from the river. In the morning, the outflow of white "粳" rice was slightly improved by taking advantage of opportunities, but the market weakened again due to the cloudy and rainy weather, with few sales. The arrival of thin "粳" and early rice was small and sales were slow, and prices showed a weakening trend. Yangdupu and Baijian also showed signs of softening. Yin yuan was in short supply, and bai yuan was priced firmly.</p>
<h3>Passenger Xian Rice: Price Falls and Sales Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of passenger "秈" rice was not much. However, after the decline the day before, it fell again by about 1 "角" yesterday. In particular, the arrival of Jiangxi late-season rice and Hunan machine-processed red rice was new, and the trend was even softer. Rice goods were less and still fixed, but after the consecutive small triangular movements in price, it attracted the continued attention of the Fujianese, and the market became more active with the price drop. Yesterday, 100 bags of Jiangxi late-season rice and 200 bags of Hunan machine-processed red rice were handled from this street. The Fuzhou faction handled 800 bags of Hunan machine-processed red rice, 47 bags of red rice, and 248 bags of Gao Jing rice.</p>
<p>People's Hearts are Cold and Lifeless</p>
<h3>The Decline in Flour Prices is Still Slight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a revolving and sluggish picture. The quoted price of foreign wheat fell by another 2, 3, and 4 "角" or so. According to this situation, the wheat base abroad is still excessive, and future dumping cannot be avoided. Therefore, although market sales have not been heavy, people's hearts are cold and lifeless. As far as the current import of foreign wheat is concerned, it is exceptionally smooth. Both large and small factories are unloading day and night, and many orders from experts are arriving at the same time. The wheat ships waiting to be unloaded are even connected in Wusong. In this case, if there is no smooth shipment from the Dalian area, the accumulated flour in this port is already very large, and it is inevitable to collapse again. Small declines were seen in the upper and lower afternoon sessions, but the declines were limited. As a result, this month was down 2.5 "厘" compared to the previous day. April to July were each down 5 "厘," and August was down 2.5 "厘."</p>
<h3>Only Ten Odd Cars of Futures Wheat Traded</h3>
<p>| Only Forty-Three Bags of Current Wheat Arrived |</p>

Although the quoted price of foreign wheat showed a step decline, the market experts did not take out their hedging positions. Even if they did, there were no buyers, causing trading in each month to come to a standstill. It is reported that the quantity traded throughout the day was only ten odd cars, showing how boring it was. However, there was another transaction in current foreign wheat yesterday: Canadian No. 2 wheat shipped in April, priced at 3 taels and 5 "錢," was jointly booked by the factories.</p>
<p>(Current Wheat) The source of spot goods is lacking, and there has been no market for a long time. Yesterday, Taixun transported 43 bags of Shaoxing wheat, the quality of the goods was still good, and the price was 3 taels and 1 "錢" 8 "分," which was consumed by the flour factory.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Grains and Bean Cakes Have Very Little Upside Momentum</h3>
<p>(Soybeans) Although the car bean factory's buying was , the market was still weak . It is estimated that four cars of were traded, priced at 3 taels and 8 "錢." Because the quality of the goods was high, the original price was sold. 800 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans were sold, which were handled by the Guangsha factions, and the market also improved by some "錢."</p>
<p>(Red Sorghum) The Jiangbei faction is 接, and the market is flat. More than 300 bags were traded yesterday, priced at 2 taels 4 "錢" 8 "分" and 4 "錢" 7 "分."</p>
<p>(Cake Market) Yesterday, 1,000 pieces of bean cake were traded in the cake market, which were handled by the Xiamen faction, with a price of 1 tael 3 "錢" 5 "分" 2.5 "厘." According to this price decline, there is still little acceptance, and the subsequent situation is still difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>Sugar Market</p>
<h3>Hainan Red and Jian Ice Rise and Fall</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight drop in standard gold and a return in Dutch exchange rates, and the trend softened again. The guild drew a price of fifteen taels and one "錢" for number 24 raw sugar white and ordinary goods, and also called for the original price for medium sand white and Dutch red, with few transactions. More than a hundred bags of real domestic cotton red arrived, Yesterday eleven taels and two "錢," Because the owner refused, the market , when Sold six hundred bags of , The price was eight taels seven to eight taels four "錢" five "分," which was five "分" better than the previous day. The former goods from Tizhuang Qing had passed, dozens of bags arrived, The owner demanded nine taels and two, but had not yet traded. Because the previous drop had been too great, and the customers' telegrams were hard to budge, Hainan red suddenly tightened. Yesterday, more than a hundred bags were opened, priced at ten taels, which was about three "錢" higher than before. Because sales were sluggish, Jian Ice showed a weakening trend, so the standard number 5 white ice price had turned down. Yesterday, more than a hundred boxes were opened, with each box priced at thirteen taels, which was three "錢" lower than before.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Golden Vegetable Needles are Sluggish and Turning Soft</h3>
<p>Recently, golden needles are not being sold in Guangdong, and the market is turning soft. It is heard that the industry has not yet reached a satisfactory agreement on the issue of dismantling the new scales for the Guangdong faction. Few numbers are being purchased by other factions, and prices are falling. The current market price is about sixteen taels for main numbers, fourteen taels and a half for medium numbers, and six or seven taels for inferior vegetables, with a flat and weak market.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea</p>
<h3>Local Zhuan Zhenmei Has Some Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday, due to the low price of exports from Wuyuan, northeast, and other places, it was difficult to reach an agreement. Only Jardine Matheson, Tongfu, and other firms bought one hundred and twelve boxes of local Zhuan Zhenmei, at a price of thirty-five taels. There were no transactions in red and green teas from various routes, and the tea market is still difficult to be optimistic.</p>

<h3>Oil Market: Hongtong Oil's Spring Sales are Scattered</h3>
<p>Hongjiang oil is at the height of its spring sales season, but sales are not as prosperous as in previous years. The biggest reason is that the rural economy is exhausted, and since the household number in Shanghai was trimmed, business has repeatedly declined. The concentrated market has become scattered without a trace. Jiahutai area in Zhejiang all purchase from Suzhou, transport by Dong waterway, there is no barrier, the journey is short, more convenient, therefore Suzhou HONG sales, the past two or three years, a thriving atmosphere, The local market still has no development potential, such as Yu Feng, before selling to fifteen, now fifteen six also sell. However, the guest family is very solid in the source of goods, without cheap hope, we can see that the market is not tired, but it is also .</p>

<h3>Our Troops at Xifengkou Tenaciously Defend Based on Natural Defenses</h3>
<p>Chinese and Japanese Forces Each Hold One of the North and South Mountain Peaks</p>
<p>Enemy Retreats Twenty Miles from Luowenyu Shanzhayu</p>
<p>Enemy Assembles Outside Lengkou, Planning to Attack Our Rear</p>
<p>Japanese Rebel Allied Forces Attack Dongshangzhai and are Repelled</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army recently attacked Xifengkou. Fearing a counterattack from our forces at Shihe, they dispatched a large number of warships to the waters off Qinhuangdao to defend. Seeing that our forces at Shihe were changing defenses and showed no aggressive offensive posture, the Japanese warships left one after another, leaving only a few ships patrolling the coast near the Beining Railway. At the same time, they assembled a large force, such as the 16th Brigade of the Kawahara Unit and the 38th Division of the Nakamura Unit, outside Lengkou, launching a large-scale attack on Lengkou, plotting to attack the rear of Xifengkou. At the same time, the enemy has also been increasing troops in the Gubeikou area for days, and the enemy will advance to the left again to contain the Xifengkou route. However, our army has strict precautions on all routes. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xifengkou has a total of two mountain peaks. The north mountain peak is in the hands of the Japanese army, and the south mountain peak is still in the hands of our army. With a commanding view, Xifengkou is definitely not in danger. The 29th Army's office in Ping received a phone call from the front today. The Luowenyu and Shanzhayu areas have been calm for days, and the enemy has retreated to more than twenty miles away. According to reports, the enemy's rear is busy transporting boxes and objects to Chengde, seemingly retreating. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen telegraphed from the 23rd that after the enemy in the Lengkou area arrived at Xiaojiayingzi, Commander Huang personally led a certain unit to fight against the enemy. The enemy gradually increased from morning to evening, reaching more than 2,000 infantrymen, more than a dozen mountain guns, several tanks, and more than a hundred armored vehicles. After a day of fierce fighting, the positions in Xiaojiaying and Madaogou were lost and regained more than ten times. Our army rushed out of the positions, destroying three tanks and seven armored vehicles. The enemy retreated to the highlands near Xiadahushan. Many corpses were left in the gully. Our army suffered casualties of more than a dozen officers and soldiers, and the investigation is underway. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain regiment of our army outside Lengkou ambushed the enemy's positions on both flanks at dawn yesterday. The enemy's left wing was hit hard and showed signs of wavering. The fierce fighting lasted until noon before the ceasefire. In the stalemate, there were still minor skirmishes in the afternoon. Because of the repeated failed attacks on Xifengkou, the enemy has now mobilized the main force of three brigades to launch a general attack on Lengkou. There will be a major battle within days. If Lengkou is not defended, Xifengkou can be obtained without a fight. Shang will personally supervise the battle and has been bombed by enemy planes in Jinchangying in the mouth of the Lianri. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Shang Zhen telegraphed on the 23rd that the enemy attacked several times at dawn on the 20th in the Jielingkou area and were all repelled. They continued to use a large number of planes in teams to bomb our positions. Our army's morale was high, and although there were many casualties, they were not moved at all. There were no changes in the Shihe, Shimenzhai, and Qinhuangdao areas. Commander Shang went to a certain battlefield in the afternoon because the war in the front was fierce. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xiao Zhenying said that the enemy at Xifengkou had retreated twenty miles to the north, and the enemy at Luowenyu had also retreated fifty miles to the north. Enemy planes were busy transporting dead bodies for days, so they did not arrive at Xifengkou for two days. The enemy also posted slogans everywhere, saying that the army would arrive soon. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qin Decun said that the main force of the enemy army attacking Xifengkou and Luowenyu suffered heavy losses due to our strong resistance. Since the 19th, they have withdrawn from the entire line and are preparing to replenish thirty miles outside Xifengkou in order to prepare for another attack. There have been no fierce battles in the front yesterday and today. I went to Baoding with Song to visit Chiang. Chiang expressed his determination to resist the enemy and prepared a comprehensive military plan. After returning to Ping, I suddenly suffered a slight pain. The cure is being sought. On the 24th, I plan to go to the front to command. Qin paid a visit to He this afternoon. (24th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Yizhou) At 3 am on the 23rd, more than 400 Japanese puppet troops attacked Dongshangzhai, about six miles northwest of Shimenzhai. The battle lasted for a long time and the enemy was eventually repelled. There were many casualties on both sides. (23rd Dispatch)</p>

Since 1930, his troops have been suppressing bandits in Hubei, wounding one brigade commander and six regimental commanders, and killing one regimental commander, with more than 7,000 soldiers injured or killed. During the war, he ordered no retreat, so the casualties were so heavy. In the future, he will continue to use his original spirit to deal with stubborn enemies. Bao Gang and Zhang Renjie, former subordinates of Fang Zhenwu, originally belonged to the Central Government and were organized into a division. He is sending people to contact them. Fang had just arrived at the military camp and sent representatives to Bao to explain everything. Fang expressed his absolute obedience to Chiang and participated in the anti-Japanese front.

<h3>Liu Ruiheng Returns to Beijing</h3>
<p>Medical Relief Work Deployed Properly</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liu Ruiheng arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 24th. According to him, since the enemy forces in Luowenyu were counterattacked and repulsed by our army, they were quite terrified and did not dare to invade for several days. The Japanese troops at the key passes of the Great Wall knew that we were prepared and did not dare to advance easily, so there has been no major war in recent days. Our side will rectify the various units on the front line, and then we can launch a large-scale counterattack. As for the transfer of He Zhuguo's troops to Pingjin, the people do not understand the strategic relationship and are quite worried, and there are many rumors. Now the outside world has understood the truth, the panic has been greatly reduced, and security should be worry-free. During the emergency in Rehe, the missing doctors were all safely rescued and returned to work in the rear hospitals. Medical personnel were transferred from Beijing, Shanghai, Hunan, and Hubei to the north, and all preparations were sufficient. Even if there is a major war, there should be no thorny problems regarding relief and treatment. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>British Economic Panic and Unemployment (February 28th)</h3>
<p>At the start of each new year, bankers always bring out their old clichés: "The turnaround has begun," "Prosperity is just around the corner." This year, 1933, they are saying the same thing. Reginald McKenna, the general manager of the influential British Midland Bank, said at the bank's shareholders' meeting: "The management of our national finances has improved... the current state of most of our industrial sectors is primarily healthy."</p>
<p>Sir Harry Goschen, the general manager of National Provincial Bank, also said at the shareholders' meeting: "I think if we recall the summary of 1932, we have good reason to say that this year was one in which our country set a good example to the world. In this year, our country restored its credit and financial dignity with a steady attitude, reduced the great difficulties encountered by domestic industries abroad, and achieved considerable results in promoting the work of recovery for Britain and Europe."</p>
<p>The Economist summarized its opinion of the speeches of the bank leaders by saying, "... From various estimations of the current situation, a common point can be seen, which is a firm confidence carrying some optimism." This complacent speech by the bankers triggered a significant reaction among the leaders of many large industrial enterprises. However, within a few days after the speech, the unemployment figures for January 1933 were announced, revealing that prosperity was not directly forthcoming.</p>
<p>The report released by the Ministry of Labour pointed out that on January 23, 1933, the number of unemployed persons registered at employment agencies was 2,903,065. This is the highest number in British history, an increase of 179,778 compared to January 1932. However, this figure does not accurately reflect the recent surge in unemployment in Britain over the past year. Obtaining an accurate figure is almost impossible, because the compilation of various statistics published by the Ministry of Labour is intentionally incomplete and conceals the actual situation. However, after a thorough review, it is not difficult to derive an accurate picture of the actual scope of unemployment in Britain. From January 25, 1932, to September 3 of the same year, 171,495 unemployed persons were deemed ineligible after being subjected to the "means test." From September 3, 1932, to January 25, 1933, another 82,331 unemployed persons were subsequently deemed ineligible. However, since the "means test" began in November 1931, more than 50,000 unemployed persons had already been denied benefits by January 25, 1932. Therefore, up until January 25, 1933, the total number of unemployed persons deemed ineligible in this way was 303,326 (of which the figure for December 1932 is estimated at 18,000, and the figure for the period from January 1 to January 25 is estimated at 12,000).</p>
<p>Among the unemployed persons receiving benefits, the benefits received by more than 535,637 unemployed persons were reduced by a significant amount, with the majority receiving almost no benefits. In addition, the "abuse prevention regulations" protected by the former Labour government deprived 179,888 unemployed persons, especially young unemployed persons, of any benefits.</p>
<p>In summary, the following facts can be derived:</p>
<p>Registered at employment agencies: 2,903,065. Rejected due to the "means test": approximately 303,826. Rejected by the "abuse prevention regulations": 179,888. Total: 3,386,779 people. However, there are still many unemployed persons working in economic sectors that do not participate in unemployment insurance, such as rural workers, domestic servants, and employees of freelancers. These unemployed persons also do not need to be added to this total. Not long ago, the Minister of Agriculture reported on the situation of rural workers in the House of Commons. From this report, it can be seen that in 1932, the number of rural workers employed decreased from 774,449 in 1927 to 697,120, a decrease of 77,329 or slightly more than 10 percent.</p>
<p>However, this is still not complete. Checking the "public assistance," the total number of recipients in England and Wales increased from 979,888 to 1,225,103 by the end of September 1932, an increase of 245,215 or slightly more than 25 percent. The number of public assistance recipients in Scotland is approximately 274,894. Therefore, there are definitely 1,500,000 people receiving public assistance in all of Britain, and approximately 3.5 million unemployed people.</p>
<p>In other words, there are five million workers in Britain who are either relying on the meager benefits of employment agencies or on even less public assistance. If we add the families of these workers, it can be considered that approximately 20 million workers (out of a total British population of 45 million) are living in poverty. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Lihuang County Officially Under Anhui Jurisdiction</h3>
<p>After a prolonged dispute between Anhui and Henan provinces, the Bandit Suppression Headquarters has recently confirmed its jurisdiction. (Anqing Correspondence) Jinjiazhai Township, which belongs to Liu'an County in western Anhui, has been occupied by bandits for many years, and its people have suffered greatly. After the area was recovered last year, the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces decided to establish it as Lihuang County to handle all post-war reconstruction matters. Subsequently, the question of whether it should belong to Anhui or Henan was delayed for a long time. The Anhui provincial government, citing the longer historical association of Jinjiazhai with Anhui province, repeatedly urged the headquarters to assign it to Anhui, and dispatched boundary survey commissioner Liu Yunqing in October to the county to discuss the boundary survey issue with representatives from the headquarters and the Henan and Hubei provinces. The headquarters appointed two Ais as the county magistrates to begin establishing the administration and dispatched commissioner Zheng Yangwu to the county to discuss the county's area with all parties. It was decided to allocate 17 "bao" from Liu'an County in Anhui Province, 8 "bao" from Huoshan County, 3 "bao" from Huoqiu County, 2 and a half "bao" from Gushi County in Henan Province, and 14 and a half "bao" from Shangcheng County, for a total of 45 "bao." After arriving in the county, Anhui commissioner Liu Yunqing repeatedly consulted with all parties on the issue of the county's jurisdiction. Everyone agreed that the county should be under the jurisdiction of Anhui in terms of history and geography, and they telegraphed the provincial government to forward it to the headquarters for review and approval, but an appropriate solution had not yet been reached. Therefore, Liu went to Hankou in early March to meet with Yang Yongtai, the secretary-general of the headquarters, and presented detailed maps of the county's past transportation routes. Yang indicated, "From the perspective of transportation alone, it is sufficient to prove that it should belong to Anhui. However, the Anhui province must expedite the construction of the highway from Damaidian to Jinjiazhai and ensure that it is open to traffic by the deadline, and please ask Chairman Wu to send a responsible telegram so that I can use it as a basis to request the commander-in-chief to approve and confirm the jurisdiction." Liu then left Hankou and returned to Anhui, reporting everything to the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs. On the 10th, the provincial government received a favorable telegram from Secretary-General Yang, stating that the headquarters had determined that Lihuang County belonged to Anhui. The issue of jurisdiction that had been delayed for a long time has come to an end. (March 22nd)</p>

<h3>Foreign Banks Vigorously Absorb Silver</h3>
<p>According to today's Japanese-language Shanghai Nichi-Nichi Shimbun, since the Ministry of Finance implemented the abolition of taels and the use of silver dollars concurrently, the tendency of foreign banks to absorb silver has become increasingly evident. The amount of silver exported to the United States reached 1,500 bars by the 19th. At present, American bankers such as the Mercantile Bank and Citibank are still continuously absorbing silver, resulting in the gradual transfer of silver reserves from Chinese banks to foreign banks. The silver reserves in Shanghai are also showing a gradual downward trend. As of the 23rd, the current silver reserves are 153,189,000 taels of silver and 258,990,000 silver dollars, that is, the silver dollars have increased by 2,600,000 yuan, and the taels of silver have decreased by 261,000 taels.</p>

<h3>Shocking News: Toxic Substances Found in Japanese Goods Shipped to China</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Doctors Research Toxic Drugs to Harm China</p>
<p>Anyone Selling or Using Enemy Goods Should Immediately Commit Suicide</p>
<p>Currently, newspapers in Wuhan are carrying reports that overseas Chinese compatriots picked up an English letter at the Zuiong Pavilion Hotel in Yokohama, which stated that the Japanese Imperial Military Medical School has established a Toxic Drugs to Harm China Research Society to distribute toxins in gauze, cotton fabrics, and daily necessities sold in China to spread epidemics. Their intentions are extremely vicious. The translated text of the original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>My dear friend, Hermil Larson, I am currently residing in this place (Osaka) and have obtained a piece of very reliable information to present to you. Please pay special attention to it. Japan's invasion of China is being carried out with active efforts every day. In October 1931, the Japanese Imperial Military Medical School established a Toxic Drugs to Harm China Research Society. Its purpose is to use scientific methods to add all kinds of toxins to the necessities of life. Among these toxins, some cause lifelong sterility (i.e., toxins contained in clothing materials), while others cause cholera (such toxins are added to cosmetics or utensils). The harm they inflict on the Chinese people is extremely vicious, which can be seen in general.</p>
<p>We also cannot fail to add attention to this matter. In addition to sending a telegram to the government to alert the people, I am informing you specifically. I wish you good health, Hermil Larson sincerely.</p>
<h3>Incorrect News About Eurasia Aviation Corporation Changing Northwest Route</h3>
<p>This morning, reports stated that the Eurasia Aviation Corporation would change its Northwest route due to the Xinjiang authorities' opposition. A reporter went to the company to interview Mr. Li Jing, who stated that the Northwest route had been operating successfully since its opening and that its terminus was in Dihua, Xinjiang, where the air station had already been completed. For the past two weeks, rumors of a Muslim rebellion have repeatedly surfaced, and the company has repeatedly telegraphed the area to inquire, but has not received a reply. The air station's radio station is still in the process of being installed, so news is cut off. Until the truth is known, the company does not dare to risk flying there, which has considerably impacted business. As for the opposition of Xinjiang Chairman Jin and the company's plans to change the route, they are absolutely incorrect.</p>
<h3>The Story of the Theft of Guo Chengen's Family's Valuable Silver Pagoda</h3>
<p>Stolen in the Dark of Night by Former Servants</p>
<p>Sold at a Good Price, with the Large Sum Remitted to Tianjin</p>
<p>Although the Pagoda Was Dismantled, It Fortunately Returned to Its Original Owner</p>
<p>Both Brothers Each Sentenced to Three Years of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Guo Chengen, director of the Central Mint, formerly served as director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration. Upon his departure, colleagues from the two railway administrations presented him with a seven-foot silver pagoda as a memento. This pagoda was not only exceptionally tall but also exquisitely carved. It was said to be worth 2,000 gold pieces. Guo cherished it greatly and placed it in the hall of his residence at 775 Changping Road in western Shanghai, protected by glass windows, making it visible but inaccessible. Unexpectedly, before dawn on the third day of this week, this treasured memento suddenly disappeared. After the family members noticed it in the morning, they immediately reported it to Mr. Guo, who sent a messenger to report to the Gordon Road Police Station and request an investigation. The detective chief dispatched Chinese and foreign detectives, including Cai Liu, and officer No. 324 to investigate the Guo residence first, and then launched a four-way investigation. Within a few hours, they recovered both the people and the stolen goods, and the pagoda was returned to its original owner. The thieves, named Xing Yangxu and Xing Keming, were brothers from Tianjin, currently residing at 9, Lane 603, Kang Nao Tu Road. Yangxu was originally a former servant of Guo's residence, but was dismissed by the owner for some reason a few months ago and has been unemployed ever since. Recently, Yangxu returned to Guo's residence, expressing his willingness to serve and begging to be rehired, but Mr. Guo ultimately refused. Disappointed, he conceived the idea of stealing the pagoda. On the morning of the 22nd of this month at around 2:00 AM, he and his brother Keming sneaked into Guo's residence at night. The house was surrounded by bamboo fences. The Xing brothers climbed over the fence and suddenly saw three dogs guarding the house squatting in the open space outside the door, barking wildly at the shadows. Fearing being bitten by the dogs, the Xing brothers retreated and purchased three pieces of cake from a nearby food store, bringing them back and feeding them to the dogs. The three dogs then fell silent. Xing realized that the dogs had been tamed and went into the house to take out burglary tools, prying open the glass window protecting the pagoda. However, because the pagoda was very tall, they could not carry it. They dismantled the pagoda and took out the sections one by one, making several trips before they had stolen everything. In addition to the pagoda, they also stole three coats and tablecloths. At 8:00 AM in the morning, the two thieves took the stolen goods to Room 29 of the Huadong Apartment at 54 Jinyi Lane, Malong Road, in the French Concession to rest. Coincidentally, Mr. A, an assistant to Detective Jin Jiuling of the Lujiawan Police Station, also lived in the apartment. He caught a glimpse of the pagoda and found it suspicious, so he paid attention to it. Not long after the two thieves rested, they took the pagoda out again. Mr. A followed them directly to the Wupin Pawnshop at 462 Gongguan Road and saw the two thieves entering to sell the pagoda. Mr. A immediately reported to Detective Jin and went to investigate and arrest them. By this time, the Xing brothers had already sold the pagoda to the pawnshop for a total price of 311 yuan. They pawned the coats at three pawnshops on Malong Road, Shunxing, Wangzhi Road, Xiexing, and Sapesai Road, Hexing, for a price of 16 yuan. They returned to the apartment and were arrested. The original stolen goods were recovered from each pawnshop. The Gordon Road Police Station was notified, and the Xing brothers were taken back to the police station along with the stolen goods. This morning, witnesses were gathered, and the two were sent to the First Special District District Court. Judge Qian Wenji conducted the preliminary hearing. After the police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the circumstances of the case, he stated that the stolen money obtained by the defendants, according to their confession, had been given to the Baxian Branch of Chongdetang for remittance to Tianjin in the amount of 280 yuan. The police immediately sent detectives to the branch to investigate and learned that it had already been remitted by the head office. They then visited the postmaster, who agreed to immediately send a telegram to detain the funds for return. A letter should be prepared and given to the detectives to go to the post office to retrieve the funds and hand them over to the owner. When questioned, the defendant Xing Yangxu admitted to the theft but stated that his brother did not go with him during the theft, but they went together during the sale of the stolen goods. Xing Keming's confession was roughly the same. After the trial, Judge Qian sentenced both defendants to three years of imprisonment, and the stolen goods were ordered to be returned to the original owner.</p>
<h3>Assassination Case on Malong Road This Morning</h3>
<p>The Deceased Was Originally a Fudan University Student from Nanxi</p>
<p>Currently Serving as an Adjutant in the Eastern Sichuan Border Defense Headquarters</p>
<p>Came to Shanghai to Marry a Female Classmate and Suddenly Suffered a Tragedy</p>
<p>At around 9:00 AM this morning, a young man in a suit was suddenly assassinated in front of No. 54 Puqing Lane, Malong Road, in the French Concession. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Young Man Shot Dead</h3>
<p>At around 9:00 AM this morning, a gunshot suddenly rang out at the entrance of Puqing Lane, Malong Road, Bailaini Meng, French Concession. Residents in the lane did not pay attention at first, but then a young man in a suit was found lying in a pool of blood in front of No. 54. The young man had been shot in the back of the head behind his left ear, the bullet had not pierced through. The entire lane was immediately in an uproar. The lane manager immediately reported it to the police station.</p>
<h3>Fudan University Student</h3>
<p>The police chief immediately ordered detectives to rush to the scene for investigation. However, the young man had been dead for a long time. The body was then taken to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall morgue for an autopsy. A letter from Fudan University was found in the deceased's pocket. The detectives then went to Fudan University to investigate. It was confirmed that the deceased was indeed a student of the school. The deceased's fellow student and friend, Zhang Rong, personally went to the morgue to identify the body.</p>
<h3>Currently Serving as an Adjutant</h3>
<p>According to Zhang Rong, the deceased's name was Du Nanxi, 26 years old, from Shizhu County, Sichuan Province. His original surname was Chen, and the deceased was the third son. He was adopted by his maternal grandfather's family, the Du family, at a young age. His eldest brother, Chen Lanting, is currently the commander and division commander of the Eastern Sichuan Border Defense. His second brother, Guangting, previously served as a regimental commander under his brother and died of illness in 1931. At that time, the deceased was studying at Fudan University. Upon hearing the news of his brother's death, he returned to Sichuan in October of that year and served as an adjutant in the Eastern Sichuan Border Defense Headquarters.</p>
<h3>Met a Female Classmate</h3>
<p>The deceased initially graduated from Jiangbei Zhiping Middle School in Chongqing. In the spring of 1928, he came to Shanghai and studied on his own for half a year. After the summer vacation of that year, he went to Nanjing and audited courses at Central University for a year. In the autumn of 1929, he entered Fudan University, majoring in municipal administration. At that time, a female classmate named Ding Yandao, from Jinshan Zhujing, developed a close relationship with the deceased and became engaged.</p>
<h3>Came to Shanghai to Get Married</h3>
<p>After the deceased returned to Sichuan, he served as an adjutant in the Eastern Sichuan Border Defense Headquarters until the 21st of this month, when he took a plane from Hankou to Shanghai. It is reported that this trip to Shanghai was specifically to marry Ding Yandao. At 8:00 AM this morning, he left the school to visit friends and said that he would return to school before lunch. Unexpectedly, he was assassinated and would never return. The deceased's old mother is still alive, and her grief upon hearing this tragic news can be imagined.</p>

<h3>Opportunity for People to Do Good Things Ji</h3>
<p>In today's world of rampant and tyrannical actions and the destruction of justice, if a nation encounters foreign aggression and does not have the determination to make the greatest sacrifices and engage in great and heroic struggles to cross the vast sea of ​​suffering and desperately seize justice from the clutches of tyranny, then undoubtedly the nation's life and soul will be lost and disappear along with the iron hooves of the oppressor. Moreover, in the struggle for survival of the fittest, if a nation's life force is already in the hands of the oppressor, and it still fantasizes about "turning over," there is certainly hope, unless it waits for the outbreak of a world revolution. However, a world revolution also requires one to have a greater and more intense determination to sacrifice, so that one can seize the "good opportunity" and not let it pass by.</p>
<p>As soon as the clutches of the violent Japanese army extended to the border of Rehe, the troops like the extremely shameless Tang department were frightened out of their wits and retreated repeatedly, finally abandoning Chengde without hearing the sound of gunfire. The remaining power of the violent Japanese army has not yet dissipated, and the overall situation seems to be hopeless. Unexpectedly, when the good news arrived, Sun Dianying's troops dared to fight a desperate battle as an isolated army beyond the Great Wall without being ordered by the headquarters, in order to blunt the enemy's sharp edge and stabilize our front. Subsequently, Song Zheyuan's troops, with "three divisions united like family," dared to take the offensive and won many victories. Recently, newspapers also reported that "Sun Dianying's troops will request an order for a full-scale counterattack, and their troops are willing to be the pioneers to recapture Chengde. What a piece of good news!" Strange! Why did Sun Dianying's troops, which are not usually noticed, suddenly have such a heroic spirit to swallow the Milky Way? When asked strangely, they said: "Today is a good opportunity for us to do good things" (see the reports of the 20th). After listening happily, we can easily imagine that they not only have the determination to make the greatest sacrifices and the spirit of fighting, but also have a unique vision to see through the cycle of tooth for tooth and eye for eye in the internal strife of the past 21 years, with each fratricidal war costing countless lives. And those who are inhumane butchers, under the command of the slaughterhouse bosses, have experienced this inhuman slaughterhouse, which is naturally not "a good opportunity for people to do good things," that is, not even the basic "way of being human," which is very clear. Now that we hear Mr. Sun's bells and drums, can we not feel guilty before the gods, suddenly awaken, quickly point our guns at the violent army to build a miracle and redeem our past sins?</p>
<p>Without experiencing wind and frost, one does not know the strength of pine and cypress. Mr. Sun can recognize that fighting against the violent Japanese army and counterattacking Rehe is "a good opportunity for people to do good things," which clearly means standing on the position of the entire nation's interests and not hesitating to sacrifice oneself to fight against imperialism. Once this message is broadcast, if it can inspire the troops of the whole country to rise up in response, then the triumphal song of final victory will surely spread frequently from beyond the Great Wall!</p>
<h3>Using the Dead? Xingzhu</h3>
<p>丨Countless Filial Sons and Virtuous Grandchildren丨</p>
<p>"A dead girl is a good girl." This is a popular saying in our hometown. So in this era, it is easier to be praised or supported after death. Otherwise, before one's natural death, one is often attacked and even hoped to die sooner rather than later.</p>
<p>We only need to look at the wealthy and famous people. Once their parents die, they will expand their publicity to express their condolences. First, they send out obituaries, using all their life's efforts to describe how good the living children and grandchildren are, what rank they hold, where their names are known, and what important positions they have held... It's as if each family member's resume is, in the final analysis, all thanks to the parents' education. It's truly a family blessed with intelligence and beauty. Therefore, the children's grief over their parents' passing is a small matter. Taking this opportunity to publicize their own achievements, qualifications, and knowledge to the public is a work that cannot be ignored. Also, the parents' bodies, placed in coffins, should be buried, but because they want to show off, they specially hire many people to carry the coffin and parade it through the streets, walking through the bustling streets, displaying many ornaments, and wishing they could take out all the banknotes in the bank and stick them on their mourning clothes. Moreover, deeply afraid that others will misunderstand that they are not filial sons and virtuous grandchildren, they pay special attention to wailing, being supported by their families and walking slowly step by step to show that such descendants are not only wealthy but also filial, and can even enter the Confucian Temple and have a filial piety arch erected.</p>
<p>In fact, when the parents were alive, they may have been scolded for being stubborn for arranging marriages or were considered misers for not giving enough money for the children and grandchildren to spend, and scolded for being old and not dying... However, once they die, the parents become wise parents, and the descendants also become filial descendants. The dead are gone, and they may not care much. The living, however, use the dead to show off themselves, which seems to be a right that the descendants should enjoy. Ah! Ah! So don't blame the fact that since ancient times, many idols have been made using the dead.</p>
<p>However, there are also exceptions. Those who are executed by the government because they have been shot or beheaded have committed unspeakable crimes. Although they are dead, no one praises them as good people. Does this prove that the executions were correct?</p>

<h3>Japanese Morale Increasingly Discouraged</h3>
<p>(Beiping) News from Liaoning: Since the Japanese army suffered heavy losses at Xifengkou, their morale has been increasingly discouraged. The Japanese warlords' invasion and occupation of Manchuria and Jehol is largely disapproved of by the government and the public. Currently, the Seiyukai and Minseito parties are fiercely attacking the move. In this campaign, many Japanese officers and soldiers have been injured and killed. They plan to conscript replacements in the country, but the public is unwilling to go to the front lines to die. Relying on increasing troops domestically may cause unrest, so they have to use pressure on overseas Chinese to order them to enlist. Currently, all men aged 18 to 50 are being conscripted. Every time conscripted soldiers gather to depart, many weeping women inevitably follow behind, which is vastly different from the morale during the Russo-Japanese War and the Eastern War.

Currently, Sun's troops are at the forefront in Sandaigouzi, where the enemy is on the flank, so no major battles have occurred. As for the supply line for Sun's troops, the section from [illegible] to [illegible] has been cleared, so it is no longer a problem. Sun's army commander, because [illegible] is in the high mountains, many volunteer armies are hiding there. They all want to join his army to resist the enemy, so a portion of them will be reorganized from Jehol to Chahar. (Special dispatch on the 24th)</p>

<p>German Chancellor Hitler</p>
<h3>Announces Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Strongly Denies Responsibility for the European War</p>
<p>Equality and Freedom as the Only Requirements</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Support for the Italian Plan</p>
<p>Maintains Friendly Relations with Russia</p>
<p>Parliament Passes a Bill Authorizing the Government to Have Dictatorial Powers</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 23rd - Today, Chancellor Hitler announced the policy of the National Socialist government in a speech to Parliament. He strongly denied Germany's responsibility for the European War and stated that the arsonist of the Reichstag and his accomplices would be publicly executed in the shortest possible time. Supporters of the government cheered loudly upon hearing this. After the cheering subsided, Hitler added that the current government is determined to eradicate the power of the German Communist Party in Germany and will not allow outside interference. As for the restoration of the empire, it will be considered in the future, and there is currently no need for it. If the states solve this problem on their own, such actions will be regarded as acts of undermining German unity. Germany will treat all religions fairly, but acts of treason will be dealt with by "savage and cruel" means. Germany has fully fulfilled its obligations under the Treaty of Versailles. The reconstruction of German warships is only taking place on a small scale. Military equipment is inadequate, and the army organization is incomplete. If other countries actively fulfill their obligations for disarmament, the German government will not increase its troops. Germany's only demands are equality and freedom. Germany is willing to share the blessings of peace with the world and therefore strongly prevents the countries of the world from being divided into several categories. Any country that is willing to abandon old evils and start a new life, Germany is willing to join hands with it. Hitler also said that common sense should be applied to the organization of commerce and the cancellation of reparations and war debts. Regarding Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's plan to establish an understanding among Germany, France, Britain, and Italy, Hitler said that if the governments of Germany and France can completely resolve the various problems between the two countries, then a kind of understanding can be established between Germany and France. Hitler also said that Mussolini's policy for ensuring European peace and development is very far-sighted, and we attach great importance to this plan and are prepared to cooperate with it in order to promote peaceful cooperation among Germany, France, Italy, and Britain. Germany should do its best for this, because this matter is related to Germany's future destiny. Hitler continued, "The current government is very willing to maintain friendly and beneficial relations with Soviet Russia, but the current government will curb the development of German communism to avoid shaking the entire Europe." Then Hitler submitted a bill authorizing the government, which granted the National Socialist Party unconditional full power within four years of its ruling period. During this period, the government has the right to enact laws that conflict with the constitution. The bill was immediately passed in Parliament with 441 votes against 94 votes. The minority votes contained the votes of the Social Democratic Party. After the vote, Parliament adjourned indefinitely.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 23rd - The draft law granting the government full powers was recently passed by the House of Representatives with 441 votes against 94 votes. In front of the Kroll Opera House (the meeting place of the House of Representatives), there was a sea of people, including thousands of members of the National Socialist Party's military. Upon hearing the news of the passage of the bill, they cheered enthusiastically. Chancellor Hitler stood on the balcony and gave a brief speech to the people, saying that the first part of the National Socialist government's program has now been achieved, and the people should be loyal to the government so that it can complete its second plan. This plan is to give the German people freedom, honor, and power. After the passage of this full-power law, it is tantamount to granting dictatorial power to the government. All parties except the Socialist Party voted in favor of the bill.</p>

<p>Reuter's, New York, 23rd - Ten thousand Jewish veterans marched to City Hall today and submitted a petition to Mayor O'Brien, protesting the German mistreatment of Jews in the country and suggesting a boycott of German goods.</p>
<p>Reuter's, Berlin, 23rd - Many people in Berlin laugh at the suggestions made by Americans that an economic boycott be put on Germany, as Germany always has a trade surplus with the United States. Political circles today admit that at the beginning of the national revolution, there were indeed acts of terror, but they have almost completely stopped today. The German government is now able to control everything. Speaker of the Reichstag Göring today accused the Social Democratic Party of spreading rumors abroad. If foreign Social Democratic newspapers continue to publish lies about Germany, the Social Democratic Party will suffer. Göring denied that German Jewish cemeteries had been excavated and said that he was willing to lead any foreign committee to visit the prisons to see if the prisoners were being tortured. It is reported that the German government plans to protest to the governments of various countries regarding the publication of such false news in their newspapers and plans to ban the import of such newspapers into Germany, paying particular attention to American newspapers.</p>

<p>British Prime Minister Reports to Parliament</p>
<h3>The Process of Negotiating the Four-Power Pact</h3>
<p>Argues That Existing Treaties Need to be Revised</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 23rd - British Prime Minister MacDonald today made a highly anticipated statement in the House of Commons, describing his visits to Geneva, Rome, and Paris. The Prime Minister said that when he and Foreign Secretary Simon arrived in Geneva,</p>
<p>Disarmament Was on the Verge of Collapse - They felt that the Disarmament Conference was in danger of collapsing, as the parties disagreed on the details and no work could be done.</p>
<p>Recognized Germany's Equality - They were forced to concede equality to Germany. Today is no longer a time when the great powers can use their combined strength to force any European nation to submit to obligations that they believe are contrary to their honor. He and Foreign Secretary Simon knew that what had to be made clear now was that the obligations imposed on any European country were honorable and responsible, and, more importantly, that these obligations were voluntarily assumed. However, recent events have greatly increased the dangers of proceeding in this way. Therefore, the British plan advocates that equality itself cannot be implemented during the transition period, but only seeks to end rearmament. Europe is now very uneasy and in a state of great anxiety, but the Disarmament Conference has been revitalized due to the intervention of him and Foreign Secretary Simon. The Prime Minister then spoke about his visit to Rome, saying that after arriving in Rome, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini showed him a short document.</p>
<p>Launched Four-Power Cooperation - It proposes to launch a four-power cooperation in Europe to maintain peace in the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and to recognize Germany's equal status in principle. The Italian plan proposes that the four powers agree not to use force to resolve any current political difficulties and proposes to immediately revise the treaty in accordance with Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>The Pact is Valid for Ten Years - If such a plan can become a pact, then the period of validity of this pact is ten years. The British government will now formulate detailed rules so that the Italian plan should be aimed solely at revising the treaty, rather than a general aim of peace. When a member of Parliament asked about the meaning of "revising the treaty and a general aim of peace," the Prime Minister replied that he meant that this plan not only has a general aim of peace, but must have a peaceful organization as its main and only aim.</p>
<p>Does Not Want to Exclude Small Countries - This plan must not exclude the participation of small countries, because small countries have a greater relationship in some respects than large countries, in order to eliminate the causes of conflict arising from existing treaties. The Prime Minister concluded by saying that when the inevitable revival of nationalism causes the peace treaties to be reopened for discussion, this kind of plan can prevent danger in Europe. The government then issued an official statement regarding the Prime Minister's statement that revising the treaty and having a general aim of peace, saying that the Prime Minister stated that the British government will deliberate on the details of this plan, so that this plan may not only have peace as a general aim, but also may not only take revising the treaty as a big and almost only detail.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 23rd - Prime Minister MacDonald gave a report on the diplomatic situation in the House of Commons. The meeting place was packed, and many diplomatic representatives from various countries were also present. From Prime Minister MacDonald's speech, it can be seen that the purpose of the British and Italian authorities is to revise the existing treaties, but the procedures for immediate implementation have not yet been determined. MacDonald said that the issue of German armaments has long been a cause of chaos, and all the current difficulties in Europe arise from this. If Europe wants to adopt a policy that can last, it must grant Germany equal rights in armaments. MacDonald used a concise document to explain the Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's plan, but he did not mention the details of its implementation. Its main spirit is that Germany agrees to cooperate with Britain, France, and Italy, and the three countries guarantee to make concessions to Germany on the principle of equal armaments in exchange. MacDonald argued that the existing treaties need to be revised based on Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant. If the four countries can cooperate within the scope of the League of Nations, then Britain will consider the methods of implementing the Italian Prime Minister's plan, the only important thing being the method of revising the treaty. However, MacDonald assured the Conservative Party that revising the treaty would not involve British colonies, and that if there were any actions against small countries, their opinions would be sought first. No changes will be made lightly until the countries have expressed their opinions.</p>
<p>(Note: Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant stipulates that the General Assembly may at any time request members of the League to review treaties that are no longer applicable and to consider international situations that may endanger world peace.)</p>
<h3>The Issue of Arms Embargo and Disarmament</h3>
<p>Questions in the British House of Commons</p>
<p>Reuter's, London, 23rd - Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Captain Eden stated in the House of Commons today regarding the suggestion to ban the transport of arms to the Far East that it is impossible to agree on international action in a short period of time. Many countries must acquire powers that they do not have today. Judging from the experiences that Britain has gained in the past few weeks, if one wishes to take such effective action in the future, one must first establish the institutions for this action. When members of Parliament asked whether the negotiations in Geneva were based on the principle of simply banning the transport of arms to aggressor countries, Eden replied that as far as Britain is concerned, it is to study the issue of arms shipments to the Far East. This issue must be studied and decided internationally before it can be effective. One country cannot tell other countries how to act. Eden then spoke about the general issue of disarmament, saying that as a result of the suggestions made in Rome, small countries also have the opportunity to participate. This plan will be managed within the structure of the League of Nations in the future. Britain's disarmament plan encompasses various suggestions and has the best chance of being accepted by the sixty countries attending the Disarmament Conference. If the Disarmament Conference is willing to accept a slightly lower standard than that set in the plan, Britain has no objection. In short, if the representatives of the countries sign a draft treaty like today's, then a large part of disarmament can be achieved, and the conference can avoid failure. There is a great hope that the international community will accept this, which is a good sign. He is optimistic because the countries attending the Disarmament Conference now have to choose one of the British plan or a similar plan, otherwise they must endure the consequences of the conference's failure.</p>

<h3>An Impression of Losing Jehol</h3>
<p>— Qian Mengchao</p>
<p>The frontier county packs books, sending Qin's troops eastward.</p>
<p>Horses neigh, passes darken, black dragons battle sea waves red.</p>
<p>Pitying the generals who abandon their armor, brandishing halberds, few heroic ghosts.</p>
<p>Facing north in Chifeng, the eyes shoot sour wind.</p>
<p>Waves strike Mount Sumeru's peak, demons attack Sudarshana City.</p>
<p>Troops come like iron hawks, no sword can slay the long whale.</p>
<p>Yan-zhi Pass is already lost, only the sound of grass and trees remains.</p>
<p>In front of the army, a new Yuefu is established, vying to sing "Dong Zhuo's Flight".</p>
<p>The remote borders are lost overnight, an event of sand and insects, alas!</p>
<p>Blowing lips startle the boiling earth, palms lose the thunderous roar.</p>
<p>Natural defenses rely on men, frontier gates are pierced.</p>
<p>The Xiangzhou troops collapse, the barbarian cavalry comes south.</p>
<p>Who bears responsibility for the city gates? The gates were dead long ago.</p>
<p>How can they boast of inevitable death, yet withdraw defenses here?</p>
<p>The homeland sorrows hearing geese, the yurt allows plundering sheep.</p>
<p>All directions click their tongues, spreading laughter, the nation is foolish and desolate.</p>

<h3>Fleeting Time in Dreams (11)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"What's your name?" After letting her sit down on the sofa opposite him, Wu Yi initially wanted to read the newspaper by himself and ignore her. However, he could not resist this girl, who kept her clear, star-like eyes fixed on him, seemingly wanting to speak. Wu Yi had no choice but to start a conversation with her by asking her name.</p>
<p>"My surname is Mai, ... Mai E is my name!" An extremely direct and straightforward reply.</p>
<p>"Ah! An actress!" Wu Yi was secretly surprised, "Unexpectedly, an actress is so generous and quiet, ... and so beautiful ...!"</p>
<p>"So you are Boss Mai. I've heard of you for a long time!" He looked at this famous actress with an admiring and pleasant gaze, and formally started chatting with her; at the same time, he inevitably revealed his own name.</p>
<p>Mai E is a woman who has received secondary education and has a high level of knowledge. Although she is an actress, her daily actions are truly enough to shame ordinary female students who use books as decorations. She speaks very profoundly, and every word is worth savoring. Sometimes she can make people embarrassed to death, and sometimes she can make people laugh to tears. All of this, in the two hours of conversation at the Da Wang Chang Sheng Company, Wu Yi clearly recognized. From that day on, he realized that not all women are vulgar, not all women are shallow. In addition to the ordinary vulgar women, there is such an extraordinary flower, so he began to develop a kind of admiration and attachment for an extremely unusual woman that did not go beyond the scope of friendship.</p>
<p>Originally, Lin Daping would go to Mai E's house every night. Since Wu Yi got to know Mai E, he would often invite Wu Yi to go with him. After Wu Yi went with him a few times, his legs seemed to have a machine installed, and every time it was 5 o'clock, he would involuntarily follow Lin Daping smoothly to Mai E's house. Later, he gradually felt that if he wanted to be a person, a happy person, his daily schedule could not be missing a few hours of talking and laughing with Mai E.</p>
<p>However, Wu Yi is a newspaper reporter, and Mai E is an actress. Their working hours are both at night, and they both need to rest during the day. Therefore, Wu Yi gradually felt that going to Mai's house with Lin Daping for an hour or two after 5 o'clock every day was too cramped and inconvenient. One day, the bravest day, he boldly went to Mai E's house alone after the clock struck two, when Lin Daping was at the Tai Wang Company.</p>
<p>"Eh! ... You ..." When Wu Yi arrived at Mai's house, it happened that Mai E had just gotten up. Her oval face had no powder on it, as white as the sky after a rain. Her natural feet, without socks, were in a pair of embroidered slippers; she was wearing a pink bathrobe; her long, black hair was draped over her shoulders, standing in the intoxicating spring breeze, truly like a celestial maiden we see in our dreams.</p>
<p>When she saw Wu Yi, she greeted him with a shy and happy smile, and reached out her ivory-carved arms to help Wu Yi take off his coat.</p>
<p>"I came too early. Are you busy ...?" Wu Yi saw that the people in Mai E's house, and the supporting actors, all looked like they had just gotten up, and were busy running around in the various rooms. He felt uneasy, so he leaned against the edge of a square table and asked in an apologetic tone.</p>

<h3>Hollywood is a Woman's World</h3>
<p>— Xi Rong</p>
<p>People in America all say, "Hollywood actresses wear men's trousers." Although in reality, some actresses do like to wear men's trousers, such as Marlene Dietrich, who usually likes to wear men's clothing, as has already been introduced in this magazine. In addition, Mary Pickford also often wears men's trousers. However, this saying "wear men's trousers" (Woman stars "wear the pants"), does not refer to the literal meaning. Its meaning is that Hollywood women control men. To go a step further, it means that Hollywood is almost a woman's world.</p>
<p>Why is this? It can be seen from a very prominent and peculiar habit in Hollywood. What is this habit? It is that the husbands of female stars are often addressed by their wives' names. For example, even though it is clearly Douglas Fairbanks, people know it, but they insist on calling him "Mr. Crawford," because his wife is the famous Joan Crawford. Clearly the man is Frank Fay, but people insist on calling him "Mr. Stanwyck," which is the same reason. This does not indicate "the husband gains status through his wife," so the husband must follow the wife's surname, but just for fun, and it has become a common practice. As for the husbands of female stars, they dare not violate the teachings of humor and rise up in rebellion, so they can only pretend not to notice.</p>
<p>Therefore, Jack Oakie once said humorously, "They might as well reform the marriage ceremony in the future. From now on, men marry women, use the women's names, and live in the women's houses. Furthermore, women can marry men, divorce them, and then marry another man, and each time they marry a man, give him a number. For example, Miss Smith's third husband would be called 'Smith the Third.'" In this way, the title "Mr." can also be abolished. As for women, they are always Misses, and people always have to call them "Miss."</p>
<p>Women are always called "Miss" which is prevalent in Hollywood. Marie Dressler is over sixty years old, and people still call her Miss, and many people still think she is an old maid. In fact, she has been married, and her husband died a long time ago. Others such as the famous Bebe Daniels, Gloria Swanson, Janet Gaynor, Norma Shearer, etc., all have husbands, but no one calls them Mrs. Even Mary Pickford's husband, Douglas Fairbanks, who is very famous, has not been able to erase Pickford's name and be called Mrs. Fairbanks. In Hollywood, the title "Mrs." is fundamentally uncommon. This is also almost the trend in Shanghai. Many social butterflies, clearly having husbands at home, refuse to say their husbands' surnames outside, and insist on calling themselves Miss, which leads to many jokes and many men being fooled.</p>
<p>Movie Review</p>
<h3>Review of "The Man Who Played God"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>(The Man Who Played God)</p>
<p>Skillful Direction, Excellent Performance</p>
<p>The Whole Film is Full of the Beauty of Stillness</p>
<p>This is a rare masterpiece.</p>
<p>A middle-aged musician from a luxurious background is very popular with women because of his superb performance skills. Among them, a widow and a young girl are closest to him, and the young girl even proposes to him. The musician refuses her because of the age difference. Soon after, a violent loud noise deafens the musician's eardrums. He is discouraged and wants to commit suicide. Later, he feels the suffering of the world and does not hesitate to sacrifice himself to love others, so-called "setting his mind to do good." And he sends the young girl to her beloved. He gets along well with the widow with whom he once had an affair.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not praise such an idealistic story. However, under the current social structure, the general art-for-art people can comfort themselves by deceptively regarding art as a transcendental and supreme thing, and even using art as a tool for preaching. Thus, this musician should perish with his music, or at least "rebirth" himself in the "salvation" of his conscience. Then they should "donate" to others, and then they "do good" with their unused money.</p>
<p>However, although their intentions are despicable, the structure of the story is ingenious, extraordinary, unique, and not clichéd. Although the development of the plot is very simple, the whole film focuses on the evolution of the plot. Since this is the case, the director and the actors of this film are very strenuous.</p>
<p>First, let's talk about the director: he used a very simple and clear introduction to the whole play at the beginning, and later he used extremely long shots to enable the protagonist to perform very vividly in the most subtle actions. He gave all the supporting actors full play without hindering the important performances, and it was not confusing at all. For example, using a telescope to make the whole play progress step by step is a very clever technique. In short, he enables the play to grow and flourish completely in the "quiet" air, the whole is the beauty of "stillness", filled with silence. This has a very similar mood to "The Woman Disputed". Of course, this is a very difficult job, and it must have sufficient cultivation.</p>
<p>As for the performance of the protagonist George Arliss, it is really profound. We can see from his performance that he has a full understanding of the play. He completely grasped the characteristics of the so-called neurotic artist and understood them in detail. He is passionate, aloof, crazy, and disillusioned, and even in the most ordinary actions, he pours all his energy into it. It can be said that the whole play is his one-man show, how strenuous! But precisely because of this, he can give full play. Ah! In this film, we must admit that he is an outstanding performer, and he and John Barrymore, James Cagney, etc. can be called outstanding talents in the film industry.</p>
<p>Among the supporting actors, we admit that Ivan Simpson, who plays Battle, also performed very well.</p>
<p>Other aspects such as sound recording, set design, lighting, and dialogue are all appropriate and wonderful.</p>
<p>"Pursuit" and</p>
<h3>"Morning in the City"</h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>Both National Films Are Good</p>
<p>On the huge advertisements, we can find "Pursuit" from Xinguang, and "Morning in the City" from Beijing, which are released at the same time. Of course, the styles and meanings of these two films are very different, but on different paths, they each have their own strengths and have considerable success.</p>
<p>We already know that "Pursuit" is Tianyi Company's sound film. Li Minghui, who was famous for a while, spoke for the first time. It is a five-cornered complicated love drama. Of course, in this kind of allocation, only two people can succeed. A and B got married, and D and E also achieved their goals, only C was alone and lonely. But he is a silly boy, he should fail, he is not qualified to have a wrong love in the first place. Those two people, B and D, are really painful, because their marriages are very far-fetched, and they are prisoners of money marriages. However, the abnormality of society is exactly like this. The idea that "love" is for the purpose of "cohabitation" is indeed a bit too biased by the screenwriter. But in the modern Chinese environment, besides marriage, there is really no way to describe the success or failure of love. This film very thoroughly explains the phenomenon of so-called "free love", and arranged marriages are just about the same, which can really make many people wake up.</p>
<p>As for the director. I don't want to say anything. For all aspects of technology. I think it's very ordinary. The photography and editing. Are still good. Then, apart from the good plot. It is the performance. Ge Qingrong's work is very light. I think he is not very suitable. What Li Minghui did in the past. Most of them are lively little sisters. And this time, she is a capable and aggressive woman. A kind of arrogant and frivolous attitude, describing modern women, is penetrating. The Mandarin and the performance are very good. Although she is very suitable for the character's personality, I still think it's a bit too much. Ma Louqian. Is more than sufficient in combat, but lacks depth. Hu Xian's work is too little, which is a pity. The male Ma Dongwu, a capitalist with a "childlike heart", is very good. Using humorous actions to satirize the world, is ridiculous and hateful. Zhang Zhenduo is the best of the male roles.</p>
<p>Let's talk about "Morning in the City." It and "City Nights" have the same tune but different performances. But it is not as powerful as "City Nights". In its plot, we find that the understanding of society is indeed more than "Pursuit". Of course, the director deserves credit. If you don't mind asking for perfection, then there are not a few far-fetched places in the overall organization of the play. The set design is very good. The contrast of classes also adds to the material. The photography is better than "Pursuit". Of course, silent films are much easier than sound films in terms of the movement and position of the camera. In terms of editing. Very thoughtful. The fall of a man is still described with a dance hall, which is a bit too vulgar.</p>
<p>As for the actors. The three who are more important 丨 Wang Renmei, Gao Zhanfei, and Biao Congmei 丨 were replaced by others in the first three episodes. These three little actors are all good. Lu Shaohui is very promising. Tang Huaiqiu and Wang Guilin, suffer a little in makeup. The performances are all above the average level.</p>

<h3>Red Dust (VI)</h3>
<p>— Jie Ke</p>
<p>"You 丨丨 Won't you go away?" she sobbed, pleading.</p>
<p>But Nice sneered, "I have something to do. Do you want me to guard him to the death?"</p>
<p>The woman trembled with anger. She raised her hand and slapped him hard. But Nice looked at her in surprise. Slowly, his eyes showed a kind of genuine interest.</p>
<p>"Very good," he said slowly and gently. "This may relieve you of some sorrow."</p>
<p>But Nice returned to the village at dusk, still thinking about Babelei. A tiger was roaring in the jungle again. Babelei rushed out of her room into the living room.</p>
<p>"What is that?" she asked tremblingly.</p>
<p>"That's a tiger," But Nice said with a relaxed smile. "He won't break in."</p>
<p>"Oh 丨丨" Babelei was relieved, she was about to return to her room, but But Nice walked in front of her.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about this morning. Let me apologize 丨丨" he began to say.</p>
<p>"There's no need for that," the woman said calmly. "You just need to heal Geli. He's sleeping now." Babelei was about to close the door, but But Nice stopped her.</p>
<p>"Are we friends now?" he asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>"What does it matter?" The door closed in his face. He turned around and sat down at the table with Mike and Ju Tong, who looked at him strangely. "Luckily, Dan is gone," Mike said. Before he finished speaking, a sharp voice struck their eardrums out of thin air.</p>
<p>"Xi! Aren't you babies asleep yet?"</p>
<p>The three hurried to the corridor, the light from the window shone on Dan's muddy body, one hand holding a parrot, the other holding a hat. Behind her came a boatman, holding a flashlight and a gun. Two natives followed with Dan's luggage.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?" But Nice immediately asked.</p>
<p>"It's a long story! I'll tell you slowly later," Dan said, extremely tired.</p>
<p>"Don't make noise, do you know? A lady and her man are in the next room 丨丨 he is a patient," But Nice gently warned.</p>
<p>"Oh 丨丨 I didn't know," the woman's voice was concerned. "Can I help?"</p>
<p>The next morning, she was sitting eating breakfast, Babelei walked into the living room, and suddenly saw another woman, and stopped in surprise.</p>
<p>"Hey, hello," Dan called cordially.</p>
<p>"Good morning," Babelei answered absentmindedly. "I am Mrs. Welles."</p>
<p>"I know," Dan replied. "They told me your husband is sick. Is he better today?"</p>
<p>"I don't know," the other woman said suspiciously. "Whose wife is here?"</p>
<p>"No. I'm Dan Zhan Huachen 丨丨 from Virginia," Dan explained proudly.</p>
<p>"I'm here to see the farm. I'm taking a boat back to Saigon 丨丨 the boat ran aground. I ran back.................. I really have nothing to do with this place," she saw disbelief in the other woman's eyes, and she quickly stopped. (To be continued)</p>
