<p>丨所謂大亞細亞同盟如是丨</p>
<p>在前歲九一八事變以前。中日間之感情。雖多隔閡。然未嘗無可以接近之機會。所謂中日親善。所謂共存共榮。日方苟以誠意倡導之。或亦未始不可以實現。今則何時乎。中日間之狀態。爲何等狀能乎日本旣席捲我東北四。省復進迫我華北。人民之被蹂躪者幾何。財產之被攫奪者幾何。此皆在目前而歷歷可數者。日軍閥所予我國人之情感如此。試問有絲毫親善與共存共榮之心。我國人受日軍閥之恩賜如此試問尙能認日方有絲毫親善與共存共榮之眞意。此又不待煩言而知者也。更質言之。自九一八以來。我國人對日之感情。惡化已達極點非特中國對日感情惡化。即世界各國。亦多不直日本侵略之行爲。此種情勢。日本豈有不知。知之而必倡此不合時宜之論者正自有故　日本在今日國際情勢下。蓋亦自知已陷於孤立狀態欲脫離其孤立。必求别國之援助。欲聯英乎。則欲求日俄戰爭時之機會已不可。能欲聯蘇乎。則根本上旣難調和而蘇之外交。又甚狡猾。今雖極力聯美。然美亦僅爲環境所迫不得已而爲暫時之敷衍。即成亦不能久。自世界經濟會議開幕以來。日本痛感外交之棘手故松岡洋右。杉村陽太郎之流。不得不極力主張轉換路向。變以前之軍事侵略而爲柔軟的經濟外交。據東京方面傳來消息。其外交方針轉變之内容。大略如下。</p>
<p>［第一准照［日滿議定書］方式。邀請中國參加。而結成遠東之政治。經濟軍事上聯盟。</p>
<p>［第二。日本爲達到上述目的。以與中國中央交涉爲主。但須與各地方實力者相提携。締結［攻守同盟條約。］隨時爲精神上及物質上之援助。日軍且表示願担任中國國防維持。各地方治安。及恊力剿共之任務。</p>
<p>［第三。日本雖無排擠他國之意。設有人干涉者。日本政府將運其實力以防止并排撃之</p>
<p>［第四設立中央或地方委員會。以解决中日懸案如通商條約。如關稅如西原借欵如治外法權。如恊力剿共等問題。</p>
<p>［第五。結成中日經濟聯盟。日本願將廉價商品。以借欵方式貸與中國。以日本之棉製品雜貨機械。等換取中國之鐵鑛煤炭。棉花等原料。作成遠東自給自足經濟。］</p>
<p>吾人對於日本此種企圖至少須具如下之認識。第一吾人須知所謂］日滿議定書］者。乃僞國之一紙賣身契。今欲拉我中國參加。即無異兼併我國土也。第二攻守同盟之說。在歐戰以前固常有之。今其用意可不言而喻。第三日本借口他國干涉。即不啻直接向列國挑戰。第四。借解决懸案之名。以干涉我國内政。故恊力剿共之說。亦列入其内。第五日本商品。將爲世界各巿塲所拒绝。故借交換之名。以實行其經濟的傾消政策。嗚呼日人所謂外交方針之轉變。其轉變之途向。不過如是而已。</p>
<p>是故日本此種親善此種共存共策之說。吾人須先認識其用意須知其外交仍是毒。劑不過加上一重蜜糖。使人易於誤嘗耳。然而此種有毒之糖。我國有識之士。亦早已引爲鑒戒。設使日本今日果欲打開其國際上之孤立謀遠東之和平者。須先去其糖内之毒質。在原則上必須立即停止軍事侵略行動。并保證以後不再挑撥釁端。在事實上必須日軍立即退出遼吉黑熱四省境域之外。而返歸日本原防。其餘問題。始有商量餘地否則其外交無論如何轉變。决無和平親善之可言也。</p>

<p>貴重鑽飾約損失十萬金竊賊必具有科學之知識</p>
<p>南京路與江西路轉角、有西比利亞公司者、專售首飾鐘錶等品、其地在閙巿中心、雖在深夜、時有巡捕梭巡過之、不意有穿窬之徒、竟乘星期日之夜、或星期六之夜、穴壁而破鋼製保險箱之背、因箱適靠壁而置、盜旣破箱、盡取其中所有的而遁箱内儲有鑽石金錶與白金錶及其他金鑲與白金鑲之首飾該店逢星期日休業、而其主人李浦柯夫斯基爲謹愼計、在星期日晨、輒至店察視其保險箱、日前晨間十一時、李氏仍照例到店一行、乃昨晨八時復到店豫備啟門營業時、忽見保險箱四周有水、心爲生疑、急啓箱視之、則箱中之物、均不翼而飛、僅剩金銀錶各三隻、鑲鑽錶一隻、於是急報捕房派探捕勘查、至失物共有幾何、現尙未能查明、因主人儲箱之物、並不一一記明也、惟估計其價值、約在十萬元左右、聞均曾保險云、按該店與日商千代照相器具店爲貼鄰、中有一梯、由人行道旁至二層樓梯底有一木門與街隔斷入晚則拉上鐵欄、阻止行人出入、諸盜藉此掩蔽、乃得在距馬路二三尺之處、從容作穴壁之圖先於梯次將水泥凝體之壁觸成一廣約二十寸之穴、然後用乙炔質火炬將保險箱外層焚成長約一呎廣約四五吋之洞、繼復用冷鑿將該箱内外層間厚約三四寸之夾層裂開、繼再用乙炔質火炬將内層洞穿、於是更毁箱内之木隔、始得取物到手、其爲功至艱、需時甚久、而竟能如願以償、亦可謂勇且狡矣、</p>
<p>迫硬登之事、否則船中早已發電求救矣、且五人在輪、與船主大副、因有友誼、故食宿同在船主室中、如果海盜、决不許其入室也、且二十六日上船、至三十日方始行刺、故完全仇殺而非刦掠也、今各船員已將詳情報告天津總行矣、</p>

<p>盛安輪之觸礁係誤觸星浦暗礁、</p>
<p>、船底已經洞破、現據津電·其觸破之處、已經大連分局派工人帶材料前往修補、將破洞杜塞、抽去積水、再行打撈、昨日接得來電、盛安輪可望救出、船身已無重大危險、俟脫出暗礁後便可拖曳出來修理、此次發生慘案船上貨件、銀錢均無損失、蓋兇手主在報私仇·而實無圖刦輪船之念也、</p>

<p>又據該公司中人言、當時五兇手初無加害船内中國船員之意、惟在船主受槍以後、尙欲抵抗、故吹警笛召人、而管事·電報生·與四舵工疑船主有特别事故發生、及至飛奔到船主室時、五兇手疑來捕捉、故發亂槍以撃、之事後五兇手對各華船員亦加以說明出於誤殺、並非有惡意出此也、</p>

<p>— 眞</p>
<p>舊時代的老百姓，不會利用報紙頌揚其［父母官］的德政；只有立［去思磚］，或是恭送［萬民傘］之類。</p>
<p>新時代早不見有萬民傘的形跡了；除非在小城鎭裏看出都天會城隍會，恐怕有許多人早不知萬民傘爲何物了。</p>
<p>這種傘旣不能遮陽又不能蔽雨，有傘之名，無傘之實；當然受着天　淘汰的關係而成爲歷史上的廢物。</p>
<p>然而萬民傘若眞從此絶跡，對於有爲的賢能長官豈不大煞風景？因此，有一部份的聰明下屬，特不惜重資，政錯他山，遠求異城，訂襲最新萬民傘；奉献上司，以博一粲！</p>
<p>據說：這位上司是當今名副其實的［紅］部長，（紅字雙關，却無絲毫赤化嫌疑）身兼數要職，（能者多勞，）最近始擺脫其所兼另一部長職務。其下屬感其賢勞，遂乘其避署牯嶺的時期，恭送一　篷式的萬民傘，旣能遮陽光，又可蔽風雨；在此傘下縱難容萬人，却不僅容納部長的太太小姐和少爺呢。如此一把大傘，據說摺疊起來時，也不過比一把普通雨傘，稍大一些呀！</p>
<p>因爲這把大傘是舶來品，估計非數百金莫辦；所以雖不算是千萬人民脂膏的代價，却不能不認是一筆可减少一萬災民的費用，輕輕的流出海外了。爲紀念有一萬災民間接受影響起見，這最新的萬民傘，早已成爲南京人的話柄了。</p>
<h3 id="c241">西藏的雪蛆 <a href="#c241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— 斅厂</p>
<p>蛆是一種蠅類的幼蟲，凡腐臭的東西，是他們產生的地方；炎熱的節候，是他們繁殖的時期。所以署天時，那糞缸裏和污水裏，此物最多，這是誰都知道而看見過的。不料潔凈而寒冷的東西裏，竟會產生蛆蟲出來，這眞是奇聞。下面就是這奇聞的事實：</p>
<p>西藏地高天冷，高山之嶺。終年積雪，而積雪的裏面，產有一種蛆蟲。這蛆的形狀與顏色，和糞蛆無異，惟頭尾色紅，而且碩大無朋，原來有二三尺長，八九寸的腰圍，因它產生在雪裏，故呌雪蛆。雪蛆是不容易見到的，因它終年蟄伏在高山頂上的積雪之下，必須那高山的積雪，不知何故倒下山谷裏來，那末雪裏的蛆，隨着倒下來的雪，一同墮下山谷，於是這雪蛆才得給人們賞識。吾友簡君，寓藏五六年，對於雪蛆，只見過一次，據藏人說：雪蛆的性質極凉，可是究有何種功用，却没人研究過。　按古人筆記中載：雪蛆，一名冰蛆，亦稱雪蠶，大如指，出四川峨嵋山積雪中，以珍味稱。然則西藏的雪蛆，何以會這麽大，但此係親眼目睹的友人簡君告訴我的，簡君是箇忠厚長者，决不會過甚其辭，所以我敢把這件事紀之如右</p>

<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>楊杏佛被人狙撃而殞命聽了這驚人的消息，没有一個不感着活在世上，做人不是容易的一回事。楊的死，有什麽原因？吾輩無從代他揣測，因記得他生前是一個雋爽絶倫，要說就說，即握一枝筆，做起文來，也是快人快語，不肯稍有遷就，吾且把約略記得的寫出來看看：</p>
<p>他駡中國人不曉得救國有標準，說［從美國回來的學生，理想中的中國，是變成美國，從英國回來的學生，理想中的中國，是變成英國，就是日本俄國法蘭西，也是成了日俄法化，可憐一個中國，没有七十二様的變化，怎様不手無措徬徨岐路呢</p>
<p>他爲高爾松高爾柏兄弟，作［婦女與家庭的叙文］中有［我們崇拜羡慕歐美的社會風俗婚姻制度，却不知歐美人方痛心疾首於她們婚姻的流弊，社會的不良，鄙棄了家内的古董，去歡迎鄰舍的糟粕，結果只是變遷不能，當著淮步丨］　他與東大同學論軍閥與敎育的一封書中，有［不知所謂進］步之對付，究爲手槍呢？抑爲炸彈呢？諸同學雖刀加我頸，槍指我腹，吾亦必定說東大南高是反革命的策原地。］</p>
<p>吳佩孚以爲赤化之赤是　尤兩字的轉音那末赤黨是　字的子孫了，他在［思想的惰性］一篇文裏，駁得眞痛快淋漓，說［本來辛亥革命以後，非僧非道的男子，和不男不女的婦人，已把一個禮敎的中國閙得不像様子，那裏再經得又添一班　尤的子孫來搗亂呢？］</p>
<p>以上幾句快語，本是他有感而發的，現在人已死了，那末就是他片言斷句，也覺得有些回味兒，足以供人家去咀嚼一番哩丨</p>
<h3 id="c243">［姜太公在此］ <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 徐紅霞</p>
<p>我們時常看見人家屋裏粘着：［姜太公在此，百無禁忌］的紅紙條。據說：在新年裏，在新屋落成的時候，恐怕一般不識趣的人們，說些不三不四的話，有碍自己的前途，而把滿腔升官發財的慾望，會由沸點而降至冰點以下。粘了這張紙就可以［百無禁忌］。　人類喜歡勞旁人恭維歡迎吉詳的本領的確是高於其他畜生，一隻毫無知覺的喜鵲的喊聲，會引起人們的歡喜，但是，同様的一隻烏鴉的呌聲，會使人們不高興，而［啐！啐！啐！］的回敬。這種見解，不曉得是那一代聰明絶頂的人傳下來的，喜鵲是報喜的，鳥鴉是降災的，所以一般賢子孫們，祖宗遺留下來的國土，可以坐視其失去而不救，這兩句話是不可不聽的。</p>
<p>現代的文人，的確討壓，不開口則已一開口就會說些不吉利的話，好像烏鴉</p>
<p>的呌聲一様，敎人聽了不高興；怕聽烏鴉般文人說話的人們，大可在耳朶旁邊粘一張紅春聯，上面寫九個大字；［姜太公在此，百無禁忌］，包管是無忌的</p>

<p>猙獰可怖的死神，它掌握了人生生命的最高權威，不論顯達豪富駁，貧窮走卒，一切的一切，都不能由它神前逃亡！於是許多衆生，見了它驚悸，恐怖，戰憟。</p>

<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十回聞語警芳心封候願渺聽歌現羨色報國身閑</p>
<p>桂枝聽他如此解釋着，就没有向下說話，江氏對於這件事根本上就没有加以注意，他認爲黃曼英是客氣話，說過也就完了。因之他也是不曾作聲。黃曼英笑道：你娘兒倆，以爲我是說假話嗎？怎麽不言語哩？江氏道眞的嗎？我們還要到城裏去打攪你啦。黃曼英道：你娘兒倆若是肯賞光的話，多了我不敢說，我請你們玩三天，聽一回戲，看一回有聲電影。再玩一天市塲。桂枝在響間去得久了，一様的像城裏人羡慕郊外風景，他也很想到城裏去看看。現在經黃曼英一再的說着，實在忍不住了就笑道：你要是不客氣的話，借一間屋子，我們歇腿就是了。到那裏去，我們自己會花錢，你别請客。黃曼英道，這事都好辦，到了那時候在說。大家商量了一陣子，竟是决定了進城去玩三天。江氏雖不便怎様的來凑趣，却也不便說不去，以至於掃了姑娘的興。到了次日起來，黃曼英又重申前請，江氏因桂枝這一程子都是怨天怨地的，好容易他高興了，若是不去，恐怕又會引着他生氣，只得將家裏東西收拾收拾，拜托趙翁帶看着門戶，這就帶了桂枝隨黃曼英進城來。黃曼英雖是個學生，家裏並不富有。一雙父母帶一個小兄弟，住了人家一個小跨院。到家以後，引着娘兒倆見了父母，黃家夫婦，却是殷勤招待。當天晚上，就買了三張戲票，讓曼英陪了桂枝娘倆兒去聽戲。桂枝爲此事而來，當然是一團高興，隨着人家前去。這是北平新式而又偉大的戲院子，當他們到了門口的時候，那送容來的汽車，早是把一倏馬路都塞住了。（一一九）</p>

<p>— 天恨生</p>
<p>是一幢一上一下的房子，住了有十幾家人家。在上海，本來毫不足奇可算得每幢一上一下的房子，都是住有五家以上。兩上兩下或者三上三下的房子，住的人家倒反而少些：那是因爲二房東比較富有的多，自己要使用大部分，分租的部分少，而且完全不分租的也有，一家獨住，自然没有　仄的痛苦。惟有一上一下，二房東的目的在赚錢，雖然無多房間，他却能把灶披隔起來，只留下僅容一人行走的路，灶披就可以分租：灶披上面，如果原來是　台的，他就可以建一個亭子間，把　台移高一層：同時在樓頂上也可以再加一層，喚做三層樓，照様的隔爲前樓和後樓，分租兩家：那原有亭子樓的，也仍可以再加一層，呌做三層亭子樓：還有擱樓，客堂背後，與原有的前樓後樓，豈不是可以分租十幾家。</p>
<p>這一幢一上一下的房子，便是這様的了。每個住戶平均以四個人計算，就有四十餘人之多。在冬天，大家還没有特殊感覺：一到春天，便有一個問題，漸漸地發生出來；到了夏天，就更感到重大。婦女們並不負絲毫責任男子中也是少數的幾個人，小孩子應負責任的却多於成人。於是那感到問題重大的男子或婦女，便飽受了應負責任者的累，憤懣非常。最可恨的，是那些應負責任的人，旣造成重大問題，他們自己却不感到重大，不明白這個問題將有重大有後果，全部居人甚至鄰家都要遭遇危險，並不是自己造成問題，只對他人有害，自己無害，像開槍撃人那様的只打死對方的。他們不明白；，他們對於亭子間裏反對最烈的程先生，竟也同様的憤懣，以爲程先生無權干涉他們的小便自由。</p>
<p>程先生般進來　有幾個月，資格最淺。他們在自來水管旁邊小便，最長遠的是已有了十五年之久了，時期最短的也已有了兩年多。原來最長遠的就是二房東自己，他首先搬走進這幢房子，第一天卽已在自來水管旁邊小便三次，從來不曾有人當面說過他的不是。的確，從來不曾有過，十五年之間，雖然也有不滿意的房客，但因爲他是二房東，儘管在心裏不滿意，當面總不便反對，最後也惟有搬出去。誰知這個搬進來　四個月的程先生，竟公然在他小便的時候表示反對，他如何不憤懣？其實，反對的不止程先生一個，大槪除掉小數幾個與二房東亦步亦趨的房客和小孩外，其他全體房客無不認爲有礙衛生。一到夏天，這些人嘴裏不說，可是走過自來水管旁邊時，却無一人不　起眉頭來，甚至掩鼻而過；同様的，這些人心裏都在感到問題的重大，虎疫的恐怖很容易襲上心頭。婦女們與自來水管接觸的機會多，那一股惡臭，往往令人作起噁來，於是也不由的暗暗咒詛，很巧的，程夫人又是最容易被惡臭引得作噁，在全體房客的婦女裏面，又是咒詛得最烈的一個。</p>
<p>小小的一塊安置自來水管的所在，每日有三四個成人，五六個小孩，其中並有十四五歲已與成人無異的小孩，在那裏小便，而且已有十五年之久，在夏季　蒸出來的臭氣，當然令人掩鼻！程先生早出晚歸，至多不過嗅着四次；程夫人要在那裏淘米，洗碗，取水上樓，又要蹲在那裡一刻兒，這惡臭就和毒箭一般的穿進了心窝。伊無法禁止小便者不小便，只有遷怒於程先生：當時來租房子，是在二三月間，到不曾感覺着：伊當時不要這房子，程先生爲着經濟關係，别處很難找小亭子間，就竭力主張租下來住，這時候便成爲遷怒的理由了。伊說</p>

<p>夏令佐膳的美品丨靑筍乾立軒</p>
<p>靑笋乃是一種細小竹篠生的筍，條細短，鮮綠肥嫰，用鹽湯煮過，復經矓乾，　成靑筍乾。</p>
<p>靑筍是夏令食品中最普遍亦且最有鮮味的美品，［茶淘飯，靑　乾。」一般人大都是喜歡的。以其價格廉宜，通常一二百文，便可買得這麽一二兩重的包一，足　燒一隻菜或冲一碗湯。（自然需要他種菜品的配合）所以能銷行廣大，並且因宅的質地，純潔淨素，更得素食家和注意徫生的人們的歡迎。</p>
<p>靑筍的產地，在浙江天目山脈，沿山各縣，以臨安孝豐產額最豐，貨身也較高。其他如於潛·昌化以及皖邊的寗國等縣，也多出產。各處出品，大多集中餘杭。再由餘杭山貨行，分配到外埠銷售。</p>
<p>靑筍於立夏節　後，便開始採製。小满相近，便可應市。由鮮筍經過蒸煮焙曥，而成筍乾，往往僅得鮮筍的重量十分之一；卽每百斤鮮筍，祗可製筍乾十斤左右。製成的笋乾，因貨身的優劣高下，而有許多不同的名目，以示區别。普通的有早元·肥挺秃挺·　挺尖·中挺小挺等。早元肥挺爲高貨，條乾肥嫩。［做手］精到‘；且無［老頭］。秃挺·挺尖·爲普通貨條乾</p>
<p>較細，　有參差。中挺·小挺·則爲較次的貨，條乾細小，且多［老頭］。至於一般的鑒别，應當取色光明綠，（色光過養的，有時許是隔年陳貨，）條乾肥嫩，體積扁平，（就是所謂做手好）而頭部尖小（反之便較老）的。普通　靑筍爲扁尖筍，却是抓住了靑笋的　良點。</p>
<p>買賣靑笋的單位，在商店與行家的方面，是以［套］計。每套計裝二十八</p>
<p>小　，外用蔑套包裹，作圓柱形，每小簍連皮約重二斤四兩至六兩。簍子也用　片製成裹面復有　　襯裹，嚴密封固，以便久藏。至商店門售，大槪都以斤計。普通人家買原套的固然絶無，買原　的也不多有。</p>
<p>此外靑笋還有一　副產品，那便是筍衣。笋衣有二種；生的杜衣，租煮。</p>
<p>焙過的台衣，風味亦是極好的，但是價值較昂，銷路也不很廣。</p>

<p>— 另境</p>
<p>一日申報上有一幅現代書局經售全國定期刋物的廣告，我把目錄數一數，總共有二百種之多。據我看，這目錄算得完備的，比較著名一些的刋物差不多都在這裏邊了。</p>
<p>平時走進内山書店，常要使我驚嘆日本期刋的的豐富現在讀過這目錄，彷彿使我得到莫大的安慰了。十三四年來的新文化運動，居然產生了二百種定期刋物，誰能說五四運動没有成績？</p>
<p>有人說中國言論不自由，但這堂堂二百種期刋物何嘗不是言論自由的［明證］！</p>
<p>從前有一種統計上說，日本在東三省發行的定期刋物有二百四十餘種，（中！</p>
<p>國只四十餘種）此數恰當現下全國刋物之數，自然這也無須我們赧顏的。帝國主義經濟侵略了八十年，我們畢竟還有幾爿紗廠絲廠，以此一比，自可心平而氣和了。</p>
<p>我没有經營過書業，不知這些刋物的銷數究竟如何，中國書賈往往把守這營業的秘密，事實上也無法統計的，好在已有堂堂二百種目錄，我們這古文明國已頗堪知傲了。</p>
<p>自然不能說這些都是指揮刀下的文化，但有一點可斷言的，即指揮刀常在你面前搖幌，不願受保護的傻子是遲早要註銷你這自由的。</p>
<p>因此幽默是一個最聰明的方法，在這裏找得出許多幽默　　　　這使我們發生無限的同情，但亦可見時代給與文人的苦悶了！</p>

<p>（一）</p>
<p>詩人王統照，在一二八之前，曾經到過東北。在那裏，他遇到一個軍官，是他十幾年前的同學。當他們談到東北戰事必然會發生的時候，他那位朋友很强調的說；</p>
<p>［中國呢，可以一戰丨丨這須要中國將海岸線的口岸抛棄，誘敵作陸上戰爭，以中國兵民的力量，避免正面的大戰，作襲撃與不定形的爭鬥，確能勝任，可是相當有犠牲自不能免。政府最好往四川移。在中原地方與之相持，若能堅忍到一年半以上，即使没有别的國家的干涉，日本也就毫無力氣了］（北國之春一零八面）</p>
<p>這個人，據作者說，是［努力於力之發揮，與按步實行的人］。他的計劃，和遷都洛陽的辦法相較，可說是更澈底的，更實際的。日本人無論有多少力量，至少一年半還不致［取成都］，這是誰都會相信的事實。不知這位軍官當時何以没有把這主張獻之當局，使不抵抗主義與三都主義不能專美於前。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>三角戀愛小說商張　　最近在某報發表了他的隨筆［江北老嫗］，寫一個洗濯衣服的老嫗的死。他聽到江北老嫗死的消息，在感情上起了三次的變化。</p>
<p>第一，是聽到了江北老嫗一生的苦行，及因產病身死的經過。他［不禁十分同情起來］，發了許多牢騷，替窮人抱不平。</p>
<p>第二，是文勢一轉，他想起了這老嫗曾經把他們［久用過的大姊挑唆走了］，把他們接着請來的女用人「又挑唆走了］，於是覺得［那個老嫗太可惡］，［死不足惜，］把［同情和歎息差不多全消滅了］。</p>
<p>第三，文勢再一翻，對自己的這［卑劣殘酷的感情］，悔恨起來，把自己大大的責備一頓，說：［人類是何等殘忍的動物啊，］而［原諒］她在生前對自己不利的行爲。</p>
<p>有人提倡小資產階級革命文學，我覺得這一篇是最典型的，而也是作者繼前期戀愛小說的公式產生的後期作品的新公式。所以，我特地把它記了下來。</p>

<p>— 澹果孫</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在一間平房様的屋子裏面，男男女女共有六七個人，用不同的方法各自支住了自己的身體，坐的，站的，躺在烟榻的，從從容容談着。他們談有甚麽呢？談的是當前的閘北打仗的消息，確切一點竟不妨說是談的閘北打仗的傳說式的消息。這一個談的姿勢，彷彿像在那裏描慕一匹在跑馬塲裏如何出人意外奪得香賓的馬名，那一個談的姿勢，又彷彿像是在那裏描　一條在吳淞口外如何若有神助地逃避颶風的小船，另外的那一些人呢，的的或者彷彿像是表示自己的耳朶並不空虚，所人只等有人談了就立刻加以補充，有的或者彷彿像是自己的關心時局對於國事並不冷落，所以一面聽一面就顯出種種表情。可是屋子裏面那一盞電燈的光明，却可以證明這些人的情緖，並没有他們當時聽見的槍砲聲音那様緊張，那様活躍！</p>
<p>忽然那個躺在烟榻上的中年人，在吸完了一口鴉片之後，拉長了那種平而啞的聲音，像嘆氣又像吐氣似地說：</p>
<p>［今天晚上的砲聲像是發動得早一點···大概現在還不到九點鐘罷···像這様轟隆隆隆來得格外怕人，也許街上不要戒嚴已經没人走了···</p>
<p>他說完又嘆了一聲，那屋子裏面的空氣像是陡然又寗靜了一下，誰也没有興味吐出了一個字來·歇了幾秒鐘，這個中年人又換了口氣發問：</p>
<p>［你認得壽子春嗎，伯唐？］</p>
<p>［認得，爹。］一個坐在桌子旁邊的少年連忙回轉身子對着他誠懇地答復：接着又顯出疑惑的神情問：［爹說的可是那個在海軍部當過參事的壽子春？］</p>
<p>［這層我倒不清楚；不過我曉得他現在是在··懇業銀行當··甚麽　理的。］</p>
<p>［對的爹；是個福建人，對嗎？］</p>
<p>［對的［福建人。他約我明後天吃飯··今天他向我說起你。］</p>
<p>［我有好兩個月没有看見他了··爹可是新近認得他？］</p>
<p>［大概有兩三個月了··打仗之之前的··好幾個禮拜我就認得他，人倒　好，老是那副笑嬉嬉的圓面孔，紅得有趣，身子也矮得有趣··］</p>
<p>說完，他又把烟槍對準了烟燈去抽那口剛好打好的烟了。伯唐却不明白他的爹丨姚雍孫丨何以會認得壽子春，因爲這二人的路數相離太遠，不過因爲雍孫一生的神秘故事太多了，所以伯唐這時候並引不起甚麽好奇心去仔細探聽，就轉回身子再和其餘那些人談天。然而雍孫却一面抽烟，燒烟，一面獨自温習當初如何和子春認識的經過。</p>
<p>雍孫本是清末一個兩代疆臣的世家公子。他的少年生活不用說是公子式的了；他的壯年到了，清朝也剛好推翻，他旣然享不到廕生世祿的生涯，就一逕依舊住在上海來嘗紙醉金迷的味道，所以他壯年有生活，也是公子式的，這様又混了十多年，他已經是個快到五十歲的人了，然而他的生活，始終没有更改，不做政客，更不做官僚，也不做實業家，只年年更換新鮮的方法，去享受上海年年變化的紙醉金迷，把家裡整千整萬的洋錢不住地撒了十里洋塲上面：所以他中年的生活也還是公子式的。大概上海那些在公共地點做寄生蟲的男男女女，只要看見那部釘着兩塊一百一十一號的黑牌汽車走到自己大門跟前，誰都知道是姚三少爺的駕到丨丨［姚三少爺］，這個稱謂，在上海的各處公共塲所裡面，是經過三十多年没有變更的！　一千九百三十年的冬季某天夜裡，這部雙料一百十一號的黑牌汽車，載了雍孫進了福煦路第二百八十一號的大門了。雍孫一經進了這所應當占住［上海小史］一節的魔力塲，就被習慣引到了樓上朝南的那間廳子裏。立刻就有兩個白衣黑褲的西裝侍者，奔到他跟前來接帽子接外套了。隨後。他抬起那個由美人式的眉目，猶太人式的鼻子和壽星式的下額這三件東西組成的腦袋，從容走到那條圍着許多男男女女的長桌子跟前，從那些男男女女爲他而讓空的座位之中，隨便抓了一個就坐。</p>

<h3 id="c278">靑年的慾望 <a href="#c278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— 鑑因</p>
<p>慾望是人人都有的，與其有慾望；才不惜身家性命，千方百計以求之，務使這慾望的目的，立刻實現，但是人是貪求無厭的動物，慾望因之也無止境，故此人類的鬥爭，也漸成爲不可避免的事實，慾望愈多，競爭也愈烈，這是一個很顯明的正比例，尤其是一般靑年，他們有如花的靑春，他們需要美滿的環境，需要舒適的生活，於是也滾入人羣去追求慾望了。</p>
<p>慾望固然是人人所需要，但過度的享受，與非分的需求，是有害人們的前途，毫無疑義。</p>
<p>靑年們是國家未來的柱石，是現社會的驕子，但他們處在這種目迷五色複雜的環境裏，在追求慾望的征途上，假使誤入了卑劣的歧途，那就會埋殁了一生的幸福，這是何等可怕的事呀！所以我們對於一切慾望，要認清那些是正當，那些是不正當，現在將它分别討論如下；</p>
<p>關於正當的慾望，約分二種：</p>
<p>㈠智識社會的進化，是跟着文化的輪齒而前進的，我們僅以有限的校中得來的學問，而追踪着一日千里的文化，顯然成爲望洋興歎，那末，我們除了學校的死板的學問以外，非切近社會實地考察實騐，以補本身智識饑荒的缺陷不可，故此一般覺悟的靑年，也都覺得欲免社會的落伍者，惟有不斷地尋求智識，吾人認爲這種現象，這求智慾，是非常欽佩的。</p>
<p>㈡職業靑年離開快樂園地的學校之後，第一件事感覺着最需要最迫切的，就是職業問題，可是在這生產退化社會動搖的硯時代，要找一個相當的位置，是很不容易的，但是在另一方面，在在均感覺着人才的缺乏，物色人才，實爲不易，這種矛盾現象的造成，實在是由於謀職業的人，根本没有眞實的基礎智識所致，自然的，在現代社會，除少數有因緣而立足於植黨營私的集團外，必要的條件，還是靑年自身先有眞實的學問才行，所以我們欲求高尙的職業，必須先具眞實的智識，人生快樂的意味，就是刻苦的報酬，所以職業是人人所需要的，也是靑年們應有的慾望。</p>
<p>關於不正當的慾望倒有三種</p>
<p>㈠婚姻婚姻是靑年人心目中認爲一生最重要最甜美的東西，故不惜荒廢學業，以求各個人的對象，婚姻雖是一件重要事情，但我以爲它只能戕害靑年的意志，我並不反對婚姻，在靑年是不宜的，我以爲正在求學的靑年學生們，應專心一志的求學，否則顧此失彼，結果徒增煩惱而已，所以我們的结論是婚姻對於靑年是重要的，但對於求學時代，是應避免的，所以我也不能認爲正當。</p>
<p>㈡虚榮　虚榮二字，不知害了多多少少的靑年，因爲受虚榮的薰化，便將於正道學問抛之腦後，因循相習，大家都只管求外表的美麗，犠牲了許多金錢與時間，却毫無顧惜，除了求外觀之美外，再也不願問聞他事，求學的僅僅掛個名，得了文憑，便算心滿意足，這種病態，在於靑年是多演幾齣悲劇，在於社會埋伏了許多危機，對己對人，均是個罪惡的魁首，所以虚榮是不正當的慾望，我們應剷除這些觀念。</p>
<p>㈢奢侈　人的愛美觀念，生於天性，故此人們的愛美麗，愛清潔，亦是必然的，可是過於求美，便入於奢侈之一途，這也是現代靑年有通病，因爲染習奢侈，便視金錢如草芥，一揮百金，猶同泥沙，這種毒害，小者貽害，個人一家，乃至於破家蕩產，大者遺毒社會，國家，乃至於消衰國脈，所以奢侈的生活，能使靑年意志消沉，奢侈的慾望，能陷靑年的人格墮落。</p>
<p>他若放浪形骸，終日逐鹿酒色性慾之塲，斷傷身體，而不自知，結果弄得精疲力衰，神枯腦竭，荒廢學業，终至於不可復拔，飲恨一生，這種靑年原是</p>
<p>自尋死路，可以不用我說。</p>

<p>沉密的烏雲，籠罩了大地的一切，電光不住的閃爍，雷聲隆隆的嚮着，階前納凉的人們，怕那大雨的傾盆，像蜂般似的向那黑黯無光的倭屋裏進發，街頭的炎熱，受了雨神的洗濯。都被驅迫到房屋裏，屋裏的熱度驟增，惹人煩悶，像熱鍋上螞蟻，坐立不定，烏雲慢慢地向東方蠕動，電光雷聲也都停止了，雨也收了，隱躍的晚星，都湧現在天空</p>
<p>，納凉的人，依舊享受着習習的凉風，指手劃脚的談着！毒蚊的叮刺，像失了知覺様的全不覺得！</p>

<p>— 亮伊</p>
<p>Ｘ校是滬上很著名之中學，學生約有一千餘人。因學生一多，校規未免有些鬆懈，不能一律遵守；以致愛情噯昧之事，時有所聞，呑銅元哪！通信互約幽會哪！吊死哪！亦層出不窮。學校當局有鑒於茲，特地組織一信扎檢查會，所有信扎，必須經過他們丨檢查會職員丨審查以後，方始發還給諸位同學。所以有情人的一般朋友們丨竟然大膽地在光天化日之下，行使賄賂的手段，什麽西瓜子，花生米，以及其他吸食吃嚼的東西，都一躍而變爲他們的目的物了。　　Ｋ是Ｘ中學很出名的小白臉，那當然的Ｌove也該比别人多一些，尤其那往來的情書可以首屈一指，堪稱獨一。所以檢查會職員也格外注意他的信扎，一因他不肯行賄。但是莫說一封情書也没有，就是連家信也是千載難逢呢！</p>
<p>星期六的下午，照例是學校的Ｈoliday可以各人的頭髮他外光亮，西裝也是格外的清潔挺直，革履擦得怪亮的，</p>
<p>面上都是敷着一層像石灰似的雪花膏；這是預備和他们的Ｌove去逛公園哪！看電影哪！開旅館哪···Ｋ當然不能例外的，而且他的修飾工夫比别人要强一點，獻媚手術也别人好一些，所以他今天打扮得年少翩翩，西裝革履，誠濁世佳公子也。</p>
<p>滴鈴鈴的一陣脚踏車鈴聲響過後，接着茶房阿三手持着一大束信扎，箭也似的往檢查會室裏去了。</p>
<p>如火如茶的太陽，籠罩在操塲上，檢查會室的門口人頭擠擠，好像大難臨頭一般的峰擁着。</p>
<p>「有没有我的信？」</p>
<p>「張，倘使有我的信，請你替我帶帶到宿舍裏來。」</p>
<p>檢查員個個都是神氣活現的看着，信也一封封雪片似的飛過去；忽然一只粉紅色的信封，畢露在各人的眼前，於是大家都聚精會神般的死釘着。啊！裏面原來是一首很平淡不過的五律詩。其原文道：</p>
<p>今日是何日，</p>
<p>日夜有幾許。</p>
<p>三日不見君，</p>
<p>時時起愛慕。</p>
<p>法輪寺左畔，</p>

<p>你勿滯舟車。</p>
<p>「啊！你們從頭看起，不是「今日三時，法國公園候你」的一封情約信嗎」！頑皮Ｃ君覺悟似的大聲呼喊着。</p>
<p>案情登時大白了，各人都嘖嘖的議論着。</p>
<p>Ｋ君的宿舍裏平地起一陣嘈架聲。</p>
<p>［哈哈！好狡猾的一位情人。］</p>
<p>［Ｈollow！本領眞不小，竟會弄到這様的一位情人．］</p>
<p>［ＹourＬuveissosily］</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>傻子阿狗吊死了。這年頭兒吊死一兩個阿狗之類的人本算不了什麽驚人大事，何况他又是罪犯呢？</p>
<p>阿狗從山東飄流到上海，出賣他的勞力，每天換到幾張薄餅。他鎭日地工作着，時光是那們快，阿狗的靑春期被湮没在不情的風雪中，雖然他有鐵的筋骨，與頑强的頭腦，也漸感到疲乏。</p>
<p>四十多的那年，傻子被擠出了出賣勞力的工塲，失業的悲哀，立刻就壓到他的身上。時候已經是冬天了，阿狗今天還没有裝上薄餅。他僅披着一件夾襖，戰慄地立在路旁，像一條快餓死的病狗。</p>
<p>［祗要是人，便應當有衣服穿，有飯吃，傻子雖老了，也能做工呵！爲什麽要餓死呢？］當他從一家飯店前走過，這傻觀念襲入他的傻腦經。鼻子所嗅［到的是魚肉的香味，香呵傻子，就不嗎？已餓藍了的眼睛瞪得這末大，伸出污黑的手，他闖入飯店的竈前。</p>
<p>傻子被判三個月從刑。他坐在窄小而潮濕有監房裏，撫弄着直徑寸許的鐵柱，他微笑。［這也不錯，反正有飯吃了］。但是那襲破舊的夾襖，却發生了問題］。傻子的老骨頭抵擋不住那末的寒冷。離開這兒吧，再待下去就要凍死了。傻子的第二個念頭。於是他進行破壞工作，夜深，鐵窗下的磚被弄掉了兩塊，不知何處來的氣力，半個鐘頭已闢成一個大洞。傻子微笑着爬出去，可是外面尖峭的北風又無情地撲來。</p>
<p>［牠媽的，這風，你敢擋住俺的去路嗎？］傻子怒駡着，結果，被夜崗聽到將他捉回去，挨了一頓皮鞭，背脊上的皮都裂開了，還加上鐵鍊。</p>
<p>［爲什麽你掘破牆壁逃走？］</p>
<p>［什麽？逃走。冷啊！我不願在這裏待了。］</p>
<p>［這是法律的裁制，不願意也得住在這裏。］</p>
<p>［不願意我得要出去，你們欺負我傻，傻！］</p>
<p>渾蛋東西！］</p>
<p>［渾蛋？你爲什麽不來住幾天呢？　　這是傻子在堂上的供詞。</p>
<p>這晚上傻子做了一個夢，夢見死去的父親向他招手。醒來，兩條腿已凍僵了。［像這様活着還不如死掉的好，爸爸要我去哩。］傻子想到這裏，就解下腰帶繋在鐵窗的橫柱上，挽了個結，套進他餓瘦的頭頸。傻子微笑着，一切都解除了。</p>
<p>傻子阿狗吊死了。這年頭兒吊死一兩個阿狗之類的人本算不了什麽驚人大事，何况他又是罪犯呢？</p>

<p>（十一）［一切聽陳先生指揮就是。］</p>
<p>當然是大清早，李石喬和王化便在馬路上［走］着了。</p>
<p>［石喬，眞是死路一條當舖都　了門，不然拿起我女人的衣服，總也還當得］兩隻洋，昨夜走到十二點　方找到八隻子，胡元良這傢伙總算慷慨，現在借錢眞不容易呢！］石喬對這些話顯然不發生興趣，他厄自在計劃着一番激昂的抗日救國的話，王化隨即轉了腔調：［我聽說老陳是工頭出身呢！他爲人如何，你看他如何？］</p>
<p>我看還好，還有點熱血他是堅主抗日的！］</p>
<p>［熱血？］血王化是孰知政客之所謂［熱血］的，他向石喬實在又没有解釋的必要，便笑着不說下去了，這様一直默着走到陳公館。</p>
<p>他們在客廳裏坐等了半個多鐘頭，陳天任方一步一步的踱出來，聽差站在旁邊把門簾搧起，這情景很容易使人想到戲台上的什麽大官員出塲的様子，鑼鼓喧天地在嚮，李石喬和王化果然情緖緊張起來，陳天任的威嚴是素來很能鎭服靑年的，但威嚴之中表示和　也是必需的，他讓靑年們先坐下，然後自己坐在他們的對面，引高着頸，做出一個居高臨下有姿勢。</p>
<p>［這位就是王化同志，是　　區的常務委員兼組織部長，］高的石喬先站起來，矮的王化便向對面點了五六個頭，［王同志在上海多年，與各界非常熟習。］</p>
<p>暫時沉默。</p>
<p>［吾。］然後陳天任打　了那矮子一番，似乎在審視這塊材料是否有什麽用處。</p>
<p>［陳先生！］那材料顯示出很能够說一番話的様子先開始不慌不忙的喊了一聲。［我們過去，是的，黨的權威確實是中墮了，我們過去，是的，我們感覺領導的不統一。放量便不易集中，所以，所以李同志，我們在這抗日的緊急時期，希望把本市的民衆團結起來，尤其，尤其是國家主義派，共產黨都利用這機會在　亂。所以，所以···但是我們却無聲無息···所以···無論如何，王化只能說出這一點，自己以爲說得太少，拼命接續下去，其實再說下去，也只是一些老套頭，陳天任是聽得怪　了的。也便會意的［晤］了幾聲把臉轉到李石喬。</p>

<p>###冯怪各方不谅察事陷于停滞</p>
<p>冯两项抗日志在保察个人进退无问题</p>
<p>宋邓表示消极中央仍主和平</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Xin arrived in Ping to meet Song Zheyuan and reported that Feng had not expressed any opinions on the proposed solutions here.</p>
<p>Song immediately summoned Qin Decun, Zhang Jiyong, and others to discuss the situation in Chahar. In the afternoon, Song met with He and reported Feng's opinions. He said that everything was to wait for instructions from the Central Government. Song was going to Tianjin for treatment within a few days due to back pain, and the transfer of the Chahar issue to Hubei might temporarily come to a standstill. The Military Affairs Commission denied the news of newly drafted two-item measures for the Chahar incident and Kong Xiangxi's upcoming visit to the north to mediate. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng proposed two measures, which were brought back by Li Xin: 1. Since Feng's resistance against Japan, his ambition has been to preserve the Chahar Province. After the recovery of Dolon, there will be no problem with his personal advancement or retreat. 2. If Song returns to Chahar, there will be no problem with his personal advancement or retreat. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng's representative Li Xin returned to Ping from Zhangjiakou this morning. According to his statement, Feng expressed deep regret that various parties could not understand his difficulties. At present, besides hoping that Song will quickly lead his troops back to Chahar, he is also working hard to recover the lost land in eastern Chahar. Guyuan, Kangbao, and Baochang counties have been recovered by the troops under Ji. Ji is leading his troops to advance towards Dolon. Feng intends to discuss other matters after the goal of preserving Chahar is completed. Judging from Li's visit to Zhangjiakou, it seems that there are no concrete results. Now we are waiting for Yan Xishan to come forward for the final mediation. Zhao Pilian is scheduled to return to Jinan tonight to meet Yan and discuss this matter. (3rd Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Unless absolutely necessary, the Central Government will never proceed according to the predetermined third measure for the Chahar incident. Song Zheyuan invited Deng Zhexi, who was in Tianjin, by telephone today to come to Ping immediately to conduct mediation. Deng felt it was difficult and his attitude was rather cold. In the future, when there is no other solution, after Sun Dianying's troops leave Chahar and move westward, and other troops are assigned to take over the defense, there may be a new solution. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu expressed that if Feng does not resist Japan, he cannot cooperate with him to the end. He, Fang, must have considerable military power to resist Japan. Therefore, the arrangement for Fang is one of the keys to resolving the Chahar incident. However, the movement of Fang's subordinates separating from Fang is becoming increasingly fierce. Bao Gang has led his troops to Datong and was incorporated by Jin. Zhang Renjie recently sent a telegram to Song, hoping that Song will maintain the Chahar situation and is willing to go through thick and thin together. It is rumored that Zhangjiakou has recently organized committees for military, political, and financial affairs, etc., in which Fang and others are participating, intending to prevent Feng's power from expanding. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhao Pilian said that the Central Government has not formulated a second step for the Chahar incident and still advocates a peaceful solution. Kong Xiangxi's visit to the north is a personal wish to mediate, and the Central Government has not entrusted him. He has met with He and Huang and will return to Jinan tonight to meet with Yan, reporting on the Chahar incident, hoping that Yan will mediate from the sidelines to avoid further complications in the country during this national crisis. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Ji Hongchang appointed Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, Zhou Rongxuan, Nie Yuling, and Hu Yushan as general commanders of the five routes. On the 2nd, they advanced from Zhangbei and Wanquan towards Kangbao and Baochang. Fang Zhenwu left Cui Guoqing's brigade stationed in Wuyi County, Nuanquan Town, and Su Guan Fort, and the rest of the troops marched towards Zhangbei and Guyuan. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Lanzhou telegram: Ma Zhongying's remaining troops, numbering only a little over a thousand, have gone south. Hami is empty. The local people are telegraphing Huang Musong, Liu Bin, and Sheng Shicai, requesting them to send troops to take over the defense.

<p>Both sides had already expressed agreement in principle</p>
<p>Number of reorganized puppet troops and stationing locations not yet fully decided</p>
<p>Puppet troops in Ninghe implement troop exchange</p>
<p>(Beiping) The issue of the disposition of puppet troops has been discussed several times by Xue Zhiheng, Lei Shourong, Yin Tong, and others in Dalian with Li Jichun, and progress has been made. Li has agreed to be incorporated and is now continuing to discuss: 1. The number of armed police to be reorganized; 2. The location where they will be stationed after the reorganization. Earlier, Li Jichun requested that 10,000 men be incorporated. At the time, Li's troops did not have that many men, and our side only agreed to incorporate Li's troops into 3,000 men. Later, Li re-recruited new soldiers, totaling 7,000 to 8,000 men. After Li's repeated requests, our side agreed to increase the incorporation of Li's troops to 5,000 men. For the defense location, our side agreed to convert Li's troops into armed police and allow them to remain stationed in the war zone, but they must leave the railway lines they are currently stationed on in a more remote area. The official defense location after the war zone is taken over will be determined later. These two items can be completely decided today. Xue and others are scheduled to return to Tianjin by ship on the 5th and report to Yu Xuezhong. They will also go to Ping to meet He and Huang and report on the trip. Li Jichun will also take a ship to Qinhuangdao and return to Tangshan. Our side will send personnel to start the counting and incorporation. The selection of personnel for counting and incorporation will still be handled jointly by Xue Zhiheng, Lei Shourong, and others and personnel sent by Yu Xuezhong. The Hebei Provincial Government and the Beining Railway Bureau, which are receiving the war zone, will also send personnel to assist. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lutai telegram: Yesterday, the puppet troops in Ninghe implemented a troop exchange. Zhang Hanchen's puppet 4th Brigade has been withdrawn, but the destination is unknown. Cheng Guofeng's puppet 3rd Brigade has entered Ninghe City, bringing with them more than 150 puppet troops. The Shunyi telephone line has not yet been repaired, and the area east of Tongxian is peaceful. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Dalian meeting began on the morning of the 2nd to collectively discuss. Japanese representative Kita and Kan Duo, Li Jichun, and others were present. In addition, the South Manchuria Railway Company was also ordered to send two representatives to participate, to make an overall discussion on the procedures for our side to take over after the withdrawal of the Japanese army and the reorganization of the puppet army. It is heard that both sides had already expressed agreement in principle on the above two issues in advance, and the meeting focused on the method. The Japanese side has no problem with the withdrawal of troops, but requested that a small number of guards be left in various places near the Great Wall line, intending to monitor our side. There was some dispute on this point, and it could not be resolved quickly. The two sides are still making great efforts to negotiate. Secondly, regarding the puppet army issue, both the Japanese and puppet sides agreed that our side would reorganize it in the original defense area of ​​Luandong, and after the reorganization, transfer it to Baodi counties east of Ping for training. The number originally agreed was 3,000, but now it is planned to change it to 5,000 due to the large expansion of the puppet army in recent days. The rest will be given severance pay and dismissed. The puppet army side advocated 10,000 people, but now it has been reduced to 8,000. Our side believes that although the puppet army is said to have 30,000 to 50,000 people, most of them are old and weak and have no guns, so the establishment must be strictly organized. Negotiations are continuing, and it is unlikely that there will be any changes. Our delegation will return to Ping to report to the authorities after the previous issues are completely resolved, which will be within two or three days. (3rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Dalian meeting opened at 9:00 am on the morning of the 3rd at the Liaodong Hotel. In the morning, the issues of resuming traffic on the Beining Railway and the connection between the Beining and Fengshan Railways were discussed, and the issues of the Lu and miscellaneous armies were also discussed. Today's meeting proceeded smoothly. According to this situation, it is observed that the meeting can be closed in the middle of the 4th. (3rd Japan Union Telegram)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Okamura, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, Colonel Kita, and Chinese representatives Lei Shourong and others contacted each other on the morning of the 2nd. On the evening of the 2nd, Li Jichun, the key figure in the issue, the representative of the Volunteer Army, also arrived. It was decided that formal negotiations would begin in Dalian from the 3rd to discuss the following points, and it is expected that the agreement can be signed around the 7th: 1. A small number of surveillance troops will be placed by the Japanese army in a part of the Miyun, Zunhua, and Ludong areas along the Great Wall line, and the main force will be withdrawn to the Great Wall line. 2. On the issue of the disposition of the Volunteer Army, Japan advocates reorganizing the Volunteer Army of Li Jichun and Shi Yousan into police teams, while China advocates disbanding them. There is still a considerable gap in opinions, so the solution is still tortuous. In addition, the issue of the Beining Railway opening to traffic, which is related to this negotiation, will also be discussed. Representatives from the Beining Railway Bureau have also arrived in Dalian. (3rd Dentong Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A small number of Japanese troops are still stationed in Shangcang Town and Xiacang Town, south of Jixian County. The magistrate of Jixian County has not yet returned to office. Japanese troops still often travel back and forth on the highway from Miyun to Tangshan. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Reception War Zone Committee will set up special commissioners and a secretariat internally. It is determined that there will be eleven special commissioners who will lead the police to receive the lost land in the future. The quota of police is set at 10,000, which will be allocated according to the county area, size, and distribution of the nineteen counties, and it is scheduled to hold a formal meeting on the 5th and 6th. At that time, Lei Shourong, Yin Tong, Xue Zhiheng, etc., can return to Tianjin to participate. It is heard that the negotiations in Dalian are progressing smoothly. Li Jichun has agreed to accept the incorporation of three divisions. According to the original agreement, the number of people will be increased from 3,000 to 5,000. The defense area can be specifically resolved after continued discussions on the 4th. Lei and others are scheduled to return to Tianjin on the 5th to report everything.

<p>Yesterday, a work train was dispatched to repair traffic equipment along the road</p>
<p>And was accompanied by the Transportation Director Steere and Chinese and Japanese soldiers</p>
<p>The work train returned to Tianjin last night after arriving in Tangshan yesterday</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining 7th train sells tickets to Tangshan at 9:45 am on the 4th (</p>
<p>3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 3:00 am on the morning of the 3rd, the Beining Railway dispatched a work train from Tanggu to Tangshan, carrying personnel from the Engineering Department, the Yangqi Department, and the Electrical Department to repair the Tianzhuang railway tracks, the Xugezhuang bridges, and the power lines. At 9:15 am, a traffic train departed from Tianjin, consisting of 150 Japanese soldiers, led by three majors from the Dabiao Moriyama and Shanxian counties, as well as two cars and motorcycles. The Railway Bureau sent the Transportation Director Steere, Deputy Director Jin Xiaochuan, Police Chief Huang Haiquan, Inspector Wang Zhensheng, and 120 members of the 2nd Company of the Road Protection Police, led by Captain An Zhenchang. At 2:00 pm, they safely arrived in Tangshan. At 3:00 pm, the work train returned, and arrived in Tianjin at 7:30 pm on the evening of the 3rd. Tangshan passenger tickets can be sold on the 4th. When the traffic train departed for Tangshan on the morning of the 3rd, the Japanese soldiers attached weapons and three iron boxcars, which were unloaded in Tangshan, but the purpose is unknown. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) There are many Japanese soldiers at Tangshan Station, but no puppet troops were seen. It is heard that they have been withdrawn. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Beining Railway work train consisted of one first-class car, one dining car, and eight third-class cars. The first three cars carried more than a hundred members of the Chinese Security Team, the next three cars carried more than a hundred Japanese soldiers, and the last two cars carried materials and workers for repairing the line. The unnamed car was ridden by the Transportation Director Steere with more than thirty public officials. At 9:00 am on the morning of the 3rd, the train departed from the East Station to Tangshan. The train stopped at the Xinhe Material Factory for half an hour to load materials. Because several sections of the Tianzhuang railway track were removed, and the Xugezhuang bridges were damaged, repairs will take a considerable amount of time, and it is feared that it will not be able to reach Tangshan on the 3rd. (3rd Telegram) (Beiping) At 9:00 am this morning, the Beining Railway dispatched a work traffic train carrying more than a hundred railway workers. A platoon of military police was sent to protect the train. The Japanese side also sent military police, more than twenty people, to take care of it together. Steere, the British engineer and Transportation Director of the railway, went along. There was no major damage along the line, only the iron bridges in Xinhe and Xugezhuang were slightly damaged. It was decided to first open the line to Tangshan. If there are no obstacles, passenger cars will resume service to all stations in eastern Tangshan on a fixed schedule, which will have to wait. (3rd Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lutai Telegram: At about 10:00 am in the morning, a Beining Railway train, escorted by Japanese military police, carrying staff from the First Army Corps and employees of the Beining Railway, passed through Lutai from Tianjin and drove towards Tangshan. (3rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telegram received by the headquarters of the Tianjin Garrison Army, the first special guard train of the Beining Railway, which departed from Tianjin at 9:00 am this morning, arrived at Tangshan Station at 2:20 pm after repairing the railway tracks along the way. (3rd Japan Union Telegram) (Tianjin) Regarding the issue of the opening of the Beining Railway, an understanding was reached as a result of the meeting between the Director of the Railway Bureau Qian Zongze and the Commander of the Nakamura Garrison Army. The special train commanded by the Dabiao staff officer of the Garrison Army, the Morimoto Military Police Captain, the Yamagata Battalion Commander, and one British engineer and several workers from the Railway Bureau departed from Tianjin at 9:00 am this morning to Tangshan. If no unexpected events occur en route, regular service will begin tomorrow. (3rd Japan Union Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, two Beining Railway trains were driven to Tangshan to repair the railway tracks along the route and all other traffic equipment. It is now expected that the train can first be opened to Tangshan on Tuesday, and then move forward to Qinhuangdao. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Chinese sources, an agreement has been reached on the solution to the puppet army along the Beining Railway. The Japanese side has agreed that the puppet army will withdraw to a considerable distance from the railway. The trains coming and going will be protected by unarmed Chinese guards, and when the train passes through the Japanese military station, Japanese military police will send troops to protect the train.

At the same time, personnel and guards from various embassies are willing to go to Beidaihe as in previous years. On the Chinese side, they are eager to make arrangements for the war zone as soon as possible. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Beining Railway Traffic Interrupted, Order Given to Negotiate with Japan</p>
<p>British Undersecretary Answers Member's Question</p>
<p>(London) British Undersecretary Eden stated in the House of Commons today that the government is now working to send an air force attaché to reside at the British Embassy in Beiping. Answering a question from a member, Eden said he had not heard of the statement that the Tianjin-Shanhaiguan Railway was interrupted, leading to a shortage of coal in Shanghai. However, the British government, in view of the interruption of railway traffic affecting British interests, has telegraphed the acting ambassador to Japan to make formal representations to the Japanese government, informing them of the importance of restoring traffic. Eden also said that he had heard that there were now several trains leaving the mines every day.</p>

<p>Wang Summons Chairmen of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces to Discuss Financial Reorganization Measures</p>
<p>Acting Minister of Finance and Finance Directors of the Two Provinces Participate in Discussion</p>

At 3:00 pm on the afternoon of the 3rd, research began at Wang's residence. Acting Minister of Finance Zou Lin also participated. Each reported the deficit in the budget for the 22nd year, the efforts to make cuts, and requests for subsidies. After a long discussion, a principle was obtained on maintaining the new budget in the two provinces, which can be decided on accordingly. Regarding the issue of the allocation of the American Cotton and Wheat Loan, the two chairmen also expressed their opinions under the principle of developing productive enterprises.

<p>Shi Ying Reports on His Trip South, Wang Jingwei Elaborates on the Essentials of Construction and Unification</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 85th Memorial Week at 8:00 am on the morning of the 3rd. Huang Jichen, Ye Chucang, Li Ciwen, Hong Ludong, Li Jingzhai, and Ke were present. Yu Youren presided. Shi Ying reported on his trip south, saying that after he reported and explained the Central Government's political information to the comrades in the Southwest, they had completely eliminated misunderstandings and fully agreed with the Central Government's various propositions. They also had several hopes for the Central Government: 1. Regarding the ceasefire agreement, they hoped that the Central Government would not change its consistent foreign policy and would not attach political conditions. 2. The suppression of bandits should be actively carried out, and politics must be reformed first. 3. The cotton and wheat loan must determine the use and establish a budget. These were completely consistent with the Central Government's plan. In conclusion, he said that no matter whether they were comrades in the party or citizens, they must cooperate with the government in the future and treat each other sincerely, so that everything could be discussed. The meeting adjourned at 9:00 am. (3rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its Premier's Memorial Week at 9:00 am on the morning of the 3rd. Wang Zhaoming, Shao Yuanchong, Chen Shuren, Lin Xiang, Peng Xuepei, He Yaozu, Chen Shaokuan, Lu Chao, and more than 500 National Government officials were present. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Wang Guangming reported on the recent situation in the new Qingchuan Province and the essentials of constructive unification, briefly stating that the incidents in the new province occurred in April, and the reasons were not very clear. It was only known that some of the people and Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai opposed Jin Shuren. Later, it was learned that the incidents were not limited to Dihua, but occurred in various parts of the new province, but it was not yet convenient to make a definitive decision. Therefore, on the one hand, Jin Shuren was allowed to resign, and on the other hand, Huang Musong was sent to the new province to comfort the people. After Huang arrived in the new province, he successively telegraphed to Nanjing to report on the situation in the new province. Only then did he learn that the new changes were entirely due to Jin Shuren's mismanagement. Jin, the master of the new province, had insulted the Islamic faith, but his politics were chaotic, the discipline of the army was poor, and he even privately concluded a commercial agreement with Soviet Russia, which humiliated the country and harmed the people more than anything else. Therefore, the responsibility for this matter did not lie with the people and Liu Sheng, but with Jin Shuren, and Ma Zhongying took the opportunity to invade the new province. It was not until Huang Musong arrived in the new province that peace was restored. At the moment, there are no problems with military affairs, but political, diplomatic, financial, and transportation matters still need to be thoroughly reorganized. Regarding the issue of the construction of Qinghai Province, since the government appointed Sun Dianying as the Director of Qinghai Reclamation, some of the people in the province were quite suspicious and fearful. However, Qinghai Province is sparsely populated, and reclamation is very important. As long as the army and the people live in peace and work together on construction, it will be of great benefit to both the country and Qinghai. The Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission has already informed the people of Qinghai Province not to be alarmed. As for Sichuan Province, for more than ten years, internal strife has not been seen, and the Red Bandits have taken the opportunity to flee west. The Executive Yuan has decided on the established principles for handling Sichuan affairs, ordering the generals to work together to suppress the bandits. The government has decided to handle the matter impartially, and hopes that the political and financial situation will gradually stabilize, so that the government can avoid the concerns of the west. In short, the work of construction is a necessary condition for unification. Military unification is more likely to lead to division. If we use construction to unify, that is true unification. Because after the construction is completed, social relations will become closer and closer, and there will be an inseparable trend. Even ambitious people will not be able to divide it. In speaking of construction, there is nothing more important than agriculture, because 80 percent of the Chinese population are farmers. If agricultural productivity increases, the country will become rich and prosperous, and the development of industry and commerce will also depend on agriculture, because it can increase purchasing power, which is extremely important both internally and externally. The Central Committee should have no objection and is determined to engage in agricultural construction. However, this matter is by no means a partial issue, but involves the whole. Because after military affairs, politics, education, and transportation have been handled, rural construction can proceed smoothly. Recently, the government held the American Cotton and Wheat Loan, and the Legislative Yuan has agreed on the management methods and the allocation of uses, and decided not to use it for ordinary military and political expenses, but specifically for agricultural construction. Now that the purpose and methods have been decided, the Central Committee has also appointed a standing committee to assess them, and the Executive Yuan has ordered the relevant departments to deliberate carefully, and has organized a Rural Reconstruction Association to gather the financial and educational circles, pooling their efforts to solve the national crisis and peacefully build the country. We hope that the whole country, under the guidance of the Chairman, will work hard together. (3rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Our Finance Minister Song Ziwen sent a letter to the League of Nations, expressing his views on the technical cooperation plan between China and the League of Nations. The letter was delivered this morning and will be submitted for special discussion at the Executive Yuan meeting this afternoon. (3rd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Yuan decided on May 19, 1931 to cooperate technically with the National Economic Council of China in order to assist China in its construction efforts. The Chinese government has now submitted a report to the Executive Yuan in a document describing the cooperation, stating that China has decided to intensify construction work in certain provinces and districts to make them model areas, and intends to ask the Executive Yuan to appoint a technician so that the League of Nations can have closer contact with the National Government and the National Economic Council. The Chinese government attaches increasing importance to the cooperation of the League of Nations, and also considers the achievements of the League of Nations technical personnel to be beneficial. Now, in order to adjust the work of the technical personnel, it is requested that a liaison officer be appointed, and it should be decided quickly. The Executive Yuan immediately decided to do so, and organized a special committee to order it to take beneficial measures. The German representative expressed his approval, but said that the number of members of the special committee should not be too large to avoid differences of opinion. The Executive Yuan still decided to maintain the original proposal, and the method of organizing the special committee will be discussed on another day. (3rd Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>[L Economic Association Nears Success or Failure&gt;</p>
<h3 id="e10">Hull, in His Capacity as U.S. Secretary of State, Issues a Currency Policy Declaration <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>Expressly Rejects the European Gold Bloc's Proposal, Acknowledging That Consolidating the Domestic Economic System Is Far More Important Than Stabilizing Currency. Hull's Remarks Clash Sharply with the Conference, Triggering Intense Impulses. Britain Plans to Issue a Separate Declaration to Alleviate the Currency War.</p>
<p>(London) Today, all eagerly await the remarks of U.S. Secretary of State Hull regarding international currency proposals. Hull explicitly stated that he was issuing the declaration in his capacity as U.S. Secretary of State, not as the leader of the U.S. delegation. He further stated that currency issues are purely matters for the Treasury. If the Economic Conference, without seriously considering the difficulties for which it was convened, were to shift its attention to purely artificial and temporary proposals that affect currency exchange rates for only a few months, he would consider it a world tragedy. He does not endorse the idea of perpetuating the fundamental economic errors that have led to the world's decline through such actions. Attempts to provide temporary, or perhaps artificial, stability to the exchange rates of a few major countries are simply absurd. A nation's sound domestic economic system, as an element of national well-being, is far more important than the value of its currency in foreign exchange. This is why the government's reduction of expenses and its ability to fully meet its debt obligations are ultimately so important. We might as well state directly that the United States desires a dollar that will have the same purchasing power and debt-paying capacity in the years to come as the dollar we desire in the near future. The broad interest of the United States lies in the perpetual stability of all nations' currencies. Gold, or bimetallism, may continue to serve as hard currency reserves, but now is not the time to diminish gold reserves. Hull concluded by saying that a better distribution of the world's gold and silver supply for national currency reserves can only be appropriately discussed when most countries have balanced their budgets and live within their means. Furthermore, the reduction of existing prohibitions is a sounder way to restore world trade than temporary stabilization of exchange rates. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) It is heard that President Roosevelt rejected Hull's and Moley's proposed U.S. policy document last night and drafted another document, which was telegraphed to Hull this morning. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Daily Telegraph, British Prime Minister MacDonald notified gold-standard countries last night that if the United States does not approve of the gold declaration, Britain cannot participate in it. However, Britain may issue a different declaration. Agreement is currently being sought from overseas autonomous territories. It is heard that the British Prime Minister has stated: (1) Countries should not engage in currency competition, hoping to artificially depress the nominal value of their currency below what is needed to restore domestic balance, in order to seek temporary benefits in international trade; (2) Authorities should moderate their currencies to stabilize exchange rate fluctuations caused by speculation.

<p>(London) President Roosevelt's rejection of the gold-standard countries has placed the World Economic Conference at a genuine crossroads. The meeting of the central banks of various countries adjourned at 12:15 PM this morning after listening to Hull's remarks, with the consensus that there was no reason to extend the conference. (The gold-standard countries are now gradually and openly campaigning for postponement, while the British delegation is focusing its efforts on seeking reconciliation. It has not yet been confirmed or denied whether a proposal for postponing the conference will be submitted to the conference's executive board today or tomorrow. However, the sentiment of the gold-standard countries seems to be summarized by one representative's statement: "The conference's final day may have arrived.") The U.S. President's recent remarks have led people to abandon hope for U.S. assistance in stabilizing currency prices. Future steps rest with Britain. Given the rapid changes, it is expected that Britain will take concrete action within the next few hours. It is noteworthy that British representatives and representatives from its autonomous territories held a meeting before the gold conference convened.</p>

<p>The declaration drafted by the gold-standard countries after Hull's speech is awaiting the signature of Italian Finance Minister Jung. It is very short and resolute, consisting of only two paragraphs. The first paragraph declares that the gold-standard countries will act independently of Britain and the United States to pursue the common policies handled by their central banks. The second paragraph details the cooperative mechanisms of the gold-standard countries.</p>

<p>The American side is quite surprised by President Roosevelt's remarks, considering them to be of an extremely nationalistic and isolationist nature.

<p>On the One Hand, Eager to Stabilize European Currency; On the Other Hand, Unwilling to Alienate the United States (London) After the U.S. President rejected the European currency stabilization plan, the British Chancellor of the Exchequer convened a meeting with the European gold-standard countries tonight to discuss the matter. The meeting began at 6:00 PM, with representatives from France, Italy, Switzerland, the Netherlands, and Belgium in attendance. They expressed great concern about the difficulties caused by Britain's attitude toward the United States. The British government is wavering between two extremes: on the one hand, it does not want to separate from the United States, or perhaps from some of its autonomous territories; on the other hand, it wants to continue its currency stabilization policy that has been in progress for several months. After meeting with the representatives of various countries, the British representatives did not take any decisions, but agreed to meet again tomorrow after the head of the U.S. delegation, Hull, explains Roosevelt's views on currency.

<p>(London) After the French delegation announced that the currency stabilization issue was expected to be resolved tonight, it was heard that Britain is preparing a separate declaration, pointing out the harmfulness and uselessness of the currency war between the United States and other countries. Britain has so far resisted the temptation of the gold-standard countries, maintaining a neutral position. However, if the United States cannot agree to some form of coordination to create an international monetary equilibrium, Britain will issue a declaration, pointing out the dangers of the United States inflating its currency beyond the needs of international equilibrium, explaining that even if the United States can obtain temporary benefits from devaluing the gold dollar in trade, the state of world trade will be disrupted. Therefore, it would be better to moderate its currency to the extent permitted by national resources. However, if the U.S. monetary policy can be as acceptable as predicted by French Finance Minister Bonnet, Britain will not issue this declaration, because if there is a possibility of agreement, British Prime Minister MacDonald is still unwilling to take a confrontational stance against the United States. Bonnet finally decided to come to Britain to personally participate in the negotiations, because U.S. representative Hull, at the request of other representatives, had first sent a copy of the main points of the declaration to the European representatives. Therefore, Bonnet said that the currency crisis had passed and decided to return to London. British Prime Minister MacDonald also believes that the most important thing at the moment is to negotiate methods to stop speculation, and seems to hope that it can be resolved today. U.S. representative Hull did not attend last night's meeting and only received a report on the situation. (National News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<p>(New York) It is learned that there will be an important meeting aboard the U.S. cruiser Indianapolis on Sunday. President Roosevelt's vacation has ended, and he has returned here by ship. According to a statement from the White House today, President Roosevelt will host a banquet for his cabinet members on the ship tomorrow noon. It is generally believed that the crisis caused by the issue of currency stabilization at the London conference will be discussed at that time. (Reuter, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was recently learned that the U.S. President has detailed instructions to the U.S. delegation regarding the U.S. monetary policy to be announced at the Economic Conference tomorrow.

<p>Taking Concrete Steps After Listening to Hull's Remarks</p>
<p>(London) Although none of the gold-standard countries wants to bear the responsibility for being the first to withdraw from the conference, their feelings about the conference last night were particularly unpleasant. France has firmly denied any intention of proposing a postponement. However, if Hull's remarks today fail to offer concrete new proposals, all the gold-standard countries may change their plans. Some members of the U.S. delegation do not have high hopes for Hull's remarks, anticipating that the gold-standard countries will find a way to distance themselves from the conference on the one hand, while not creating an actual and obvious rupture on the other. The means they adopt will be roughly to withdraw their main financial representatives. In short, if the situation is still not clarified by tonight or tomorrow, the gold-standard countries will definitely take concrete steps. This is certainly to be expected. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Washington) U.S. Senator Robinson said in Boston today that reducing tariffs, lightening taxes, and other internal burdens in various countries will greatly help economic recovery.

The Economic Conference can still correct its past mistakes at this time, but if it continues in the old ways and leads to failure, there will be endless economic wars. Robinson deeply regretted the failure to reach an agreement at the Disarmament Conference, saying that if agreement could be reached on disarmament, it would be possible to reduce the world's taxes today, thereby opening up avenues to promote domestic and international trade. If what is spent on armaments can be used to promote trade, the economic world would have recovered long ago. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>

<p>(London) Today, the French government declared that if the Economic Conference cannot reach a satisfactory agreement on stabilizing currency prices, France will levy special surcharges on all U.S. goods to offset the benefits of the U.S. currency devaluation. When the French agreed to a tariff truce, they reserved the right to levy surcharges. It is also heard that the French intend to notify the conference that they are unwilling to extend the truce period if an agreement cannot be reached within a few days. At the same time, they will decide on a definite date for imposing surcharges on U.S. goods, giving the U.S. shipping industry ample warning. It is said that this date will be around July 15. Although the U.S. representative will explain the U.S. monetary policy tomorrow, few representatives expect it to satisfy the gold-standard countries. U.S. Secretary of State Hull has indicated that negotiations on the currency issue will be reopened and admitted that he does not intend to meet with European representatives again before issuing the monetary policy. The French delegation now feels that there is little hope of reaching an agreement. (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>

<p>(London) French Finance Minister Bonnet is expected to arrive in London last night and will bring the French government's new instructions to the French delegation at the Economic Conference. (Havas, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the French delegation to the Economic Conference exchanged messages with the French government in Paris. The only notable event this morning was this communication. France's position has remained unchanged from beginning to end, namely that, in the current state of the world, a currency with stable market value is the only solid foundation and should not be harmed by the devaluation of the U.S. dollar and international speculation. The restoration of the world economy should be conditional on this. This position is eminently reasonable and cannot be shaken by any decision made by the United States. Therefore, the French delegation, while expressing regret over the United States' refusal to participate in a joint declaration, has remained calm and its position has remained unchanged.

<p>(Washington) It was reliably reported today that the U.S. President cannot endorse any stabilization plan that would cause prices to fall even slightly. The U.S. President will agree to prevent speculative activities, but only to that extent and no further. At the same time, the U.S. Department of Agriculture also revealed a fundamental reason for the U.S. President's adoption of this attitude. According to the New Orleans Cotton Exchange, southern farmers have sold cotton worth a total of $10 million in the past six weeks. If this cotton had been sold in March, it would have only been worth $6 million, so they have now earned an additional $4 million. In addition, the prices of textiles and retail goods have risen similarly to wholesale prices. If prices suddenly plummeted at this time, it would greatly affect the morale of the entire country. The U.S. President holds this belief, so his attitude toward the stabilization issue is very firm. Furthermore, official sources claim that the U.S. President views stabilizing currency prices as far less important than the European representatives do. The U.S. President believes that the Economic Conference has many ways to contribute to the world's recovery, so why must it be limited to stabilizing currency prices? (National News Agency, 2nd)</p>

Before long, it fell to $4.48, but shorts covered, so the price recovered slightly, returning to $4.45.15. The exchange rate of the British pound against gold coins fell slightly this morning. European operators sold dollars here, using British currency as collateral. It is believed that this is due to rumors that Britain is now working to mediate, because European operators are unable to determine Britain's final policy on the gold standard. (Reuter, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) If there are no new developments at the Economic Conference this week, the Japanese government will take advantage of the presence of representatives from various countries in London and instruct Representative Ishii to begin separate negotiations with major countries to resolve the following issues, thereby breaking through domestic economic difficulties: (1) Negotiating treaties with various countries to stop boycotts of Japanese goods; (2) Negotiating with various countries on the principle of free trade; (3) Negotiating with various countries on tariff, navigation, and free movement of capital issues. On the tariff issue, they will strongly advocate the unconditional restoration of most-favored-nation treatment; (4) In London, they will first discuss the outline of the various issues mentioned above with the United States, France, Italy, Germany, and the Netherlands, leaving the details to be continued by the various ambassadors in their respective posts.

<p>丨The So-Called Greater East Asia Alliance, Just Like This丨</p>
<p>Before the September 18th Incident two years ago, the relationship between China and Japan, although filled with many rifts, had not been without opportunities for approach. The so-called Sino-Japanese amity, the so-called coexistence and co-prosperity, if the Japanese side had advocated it with sincerity, might not have been impossible to realize. But where are we now? What is the state of Sino-Japanese relations? Japan has already swept through our four Northeastern provinces and is now encroaching upon our North China. How many of our people have been trampled upon? How much of our property has been seized? All this is right before our eyes and can be counted one by one. This is the kind of emotion that the Japanese militarists have bestowed upon our countrymen. I ask, is there a shred of amity or a heart for coexistence and co-prosperity? Our countrymen have received such benefaction from the Japanese militarists, I ask, can they still recognize any sincerity in the Japanese side's amity or coexistence and co-prosperity? This is something that can be known without having to trouble ourselves with further words. To put it more bluntly, since September 18th, the Chinese people's feelings towards Japan have deteriorated to the extreme. It is not just that China's feelings towards Japan have deteriorated, but also that many countries around the world disapprove of Japan's aggressive behavior. How could Japan not know about this situation? The reason why they must advocate this untimely theory, even knowing about it, is because they have their own reasons. Under today's international circumstances, Japan also knows that it has fallen into a state of isolation. To escape its isolation, it must seek assistance from other countries. Does it want to ally with Britain? Then, the opportunity it sought during the Russo-Japanese War can no longer be achieved. Does it want to ally with the Soviet Union? Then, it is fundamentally difficult to reconcile, and Soviet diplomacy is very cunning. Now, although it is trying its best to ally with the United States, the United States is only forced by the environment and is reluctantly giving temporary perfunctory treatment. Even if it succeeds, it will not last long. Since the opening of the World Economic Conference, Japan has keenly felt the difficulty of diplomacy, so figures like Yosuke Matsuoka and Yotaro Sugimura have had to strongly advocate a change of course, transforming the previous military aggression into flexible economic diplomacy. According to news from Tokyo, the contents of its diplomatic policy shift are roughly as follows:</p>
<p>[1. Invite China to participate in accordance with the [Japan-Manchukuo Protocol] formula and form a political, economic, and military alliance in the Far East.</p>
<p>[2. In order to achieve the above objectives, Japan will focus on negotiating with the Chinese central government, but must also cooperate with various local power holders, concluding [Treaties of Alliance for Offense and Defense], providing spiritual and material assistance at any time. The Japanese army also expressed its willingness to assume the tasks of Chinese national defense, maintaining local security, and assisting in suppressing communists.</p>
<p>[3. Although Japan has no intention of excluding other countries, if anyone interferes, the Japanese government will use its strength to prevent and repel them.</p>
<p>[4. Establish central or local committees to resolve Sino-Japanese pending issues such as commercial treaties, tariffs, the Nishihara Loans, extraterritoriality, and assistance in suppressing communists.</p>
<p>[5. Form a Sino-Japanese economic alliance. Japan is willing to lend inexpensive goods to China in the form of loans, exchanging China's iron ore, coal, cotton, and other raw materials for Japan's cotton products, sundries, and machinery, creating a self-sufficient economy in the Far East.]</p>
<p>We must have at least the following understanding of Japan's attempt. First, we must know that the so-called [Japan-Manchukuo Protocol] is a contract of indenture for the puppet state. Now, if it wants to pull our China to participate, it is no different from annexing our territory. Second, the theory of alliances for offense and defense existed before the European War, but its intention is self-evident now. Third, Japan's pretext of other countries interfering is tantamount to directly challenging the nations. Fourth, it is interfering in our country's internal affairs under the name of resolving pending issues, so the theory of assisting in suppressing communists is also included in it. Fifth, Japanese goods will be rejected by markets around the world, so it is implementing its economic dumping policy in the name of exchange. Alas, the so-called shift in diplomatic policy by the Japanese is nothing more than this.</p>
<p>Therefore, with regard to this kind of Japanese amity and this kind of coexistence and co-prosperity theory, we must first recognize its intention and know that its diplomacy is still poison, but it has added a layer of honey to make it easier for people to mistakenly taste it. However, the knowledgeable people of our country have long since regarded this kind of poisonous sugar as a warning. If Japan truly wants to overcome its international isolation and seek peace in the Far East today, it must first remove the poisonous substance from its sugar. In principle, it must immediately stop military aggression and guarantee that it will no longer provoke disputes in the future. In fact, the Japanese army must immediately withdraw from the territory of the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe and return to the original defense of Japan. Only then will there be room for negotiation on other issues. Otherwise, no matter how its diplomacy shifts, there will be no peace and amity to speak of.</p>

<h3 id="e31">Under the Scorching Sun, Over Two Hundred Japanese Soldiers Suffer Heatstroke <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>Drills in Pursuit Warfare at the Foot of Mount Fuji; What is the Truth About Soldiers Falling One After Another? Japanese Army Authorities Keep a Tight Lip</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese army is conducting drills at the foot of Mount Fuji. The Tokyo Akasaka 1st Infantry Regiment also participated. Stationed in the three villages of Tomioka, Fujioka, and Suyama, they began pursuit practice on the morning of the 2nd. The weather was exceptionally hot that day. Under the scorching sun, exposed to direct sunlight, heatstroke and sunstroke cases continued to occur in the regiment, with soldiers falling one after another, some of whom went mad. The drill authorities immediately called up local reservists, youth groups, and firefighters to carry out rescue operations. At the same time, a temporary field hospital was set up in Ohara to accommodate the patients. The army authorities issued a gag order on this matter, strictly maintaining secrecy and not discussing the truth, so it is difficult to know the news. However, it seems that no fewer than 250 people were sick, including 7 deaths and 20 seriously ill, which is a confirmed fact. (Japan United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The battle line of the troops that suffered sunstroke stretched for several miles. The incident occurred just as the two armies were about to attack in skirmish formation. The army authorities immediately ordered the drills to be stopped and sent personnel to search for the sick, while seriously guarding the surrounding area. (Japan United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After the tragedy at the foot of Mount Fuji, the army authorities notified Army Minister Araki, who was traveling, and held a meeting within the Army Ministry to deal with the aftermath. The responsibility for failing to establish sanitation and rescue equipment in the drill plan, which led to the loss of soldiers' lives and the illness of a large number of soldiers, naturally lies with the commanding officer. According to the observation of the army authorities, the reasons are roughly as follows: (1) Marching in scorching heat and hot wind; (2) Soldiers were exhausted from advancing in skirmish formation; (3) The troops advanced rapidly to the planned destination due to tactical reasons; (4) The terrain was sloping and had no trees to shade the sunlight. (Japan United Press, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In the drills at the foot of Mount Fuji, sunstroke suddenly occurred. The Army Ministry today issued a special announcement on the details: On the 2nd, during a joint drill by the 1st Infantry Brigade, from 11:00 AM to 2:00 PM, patients with sunstroke suddenly occurred in the 1st Regiment, including 7 deaths. The humid hot wind on that day was a southerly wind. The sunstroke patients occurred in the 1st Regiment during the encounter battle with the Kofu Regiment due to the regiment's rapid march. The 7 deaths were treated as deaths in action and were given generous awards for their merits. Among them, five second-class soldiers were promoted to first-class soldiers, one first-class soldier was promoted to corporal, and one corporal-level candidate was also promoted to corporal.

<p>Russian and Japanese Opinions Diverge Greatly: Japan Wants to Use the Karakhan Declaration as the Basis; Russia Insists on the 1924 Agreement</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The third meeting for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway was held today, commencing substantive discussions. The core of the discussions naturally revolved around the price issue, but the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway's subsidiary businesses was also included in the discussions. The most important of these were the Chalainor coal mine, forestry, and over a dozen power plants along the line. Commercial subsidiaries include Songhua River shipping, the Harbin water and electricity lumber mill, the Harbin stadium and hotels, etc. The transfer of the export cargo wharf at Vladivostok Port will also be negotiated together. (3rd Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The third meeting for the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway opened at 3 PM today. It is reported that the opinions between Russia [and Manchuria] (Russia and Japan) are still greatly divergent. The content of the respective claims, which has now become clear, is as follows: (1) Russia insists on using the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement as the basic principle for discussing the handling of all rights and obligations of the Chinese Eastern Railway. (2) The puppet state (actually Japan) claims to use the 1919 and 1920 Karakhan Declarations as the basis, stating that Russia has abandoned the Chinese Eastern Railway as the starting point for negotiations. Therefore, the claims of the two sides are far apart. (3) The Japanese Army also claims that there is a secret agreement between China and Russia aimed at infringing upon Japan's independence, saying that Li Hongzhang of the former Qing Dynasty signed a secret agreement with Tsarist Russia in May 1896. Based on this historical fact, Japan does not need to spend a considerable price to purchase the Chinese Eastern Railway. The actual power of the Chinese Eastern Railway has fallen into the hands of the Japanese army since September 18th, and at present, Soviet Russia has no way to recover it. Japan does not need to spend huge sums of money on malicious aggressors to reward their unsuccessful ambitions, so whether or not to purchase it has little to do with Japan. (4) The Japanese military and the Foreign Ministry, based on the claims listed in item 3, have vastly different valuations of the Chinese Eastern Railway itself compared to the Russian side. The Chinese Eastern Railway also has affiliated businesses such as forestry, coal mining, transportation, insurance, finance, warehousing, customs clearance, consignment sales, wool dyeing factories, hydraulic packaging factories, and electrical businesses. Once separated from the Chinese Eastern Railway, their value is equal to zero. The Japanese side advocates for separate discussions, with the intention of seizing various Russian economic forces at the lowest price. (5) Japan regards the Russian side's hospitals, schools, and various commercial organizations as major bases for propagating communism and will include them in the list to be sealed off. Given the above conflicting situations, the content expressed by both sides at today's meeting is noteworthy. (3rd China United Press Telegram)</p>

<p>Subsidies to Nisshin Shipping Company Increase Annually</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government has decided to further increase the subsidies to Nisshin Shipping Company in next year's budget. The Japanese Foreign Ministry, Army, Navy, and Colonization Ministry all support the Ministry of Transportation's claim that Nisshin Shipping Company's ships travel to the Yangtze River, North China, and South China, and have done much to open up Japan's economic bases in China and serve the country. Since September 18th, many of its bases have been occupied by Chinese merchants and various European and American countries, and the losses suffered in Japan's continental policy have been significant. At this time, Japan must endure the pain and continue to maintain the shipping routes. In 1932, the government already subsidized 300,000 yuan, which was increased to 700,000 yuan this year. It has been decided to increase it to 1 million yuan next year. It is reported that the Ministry of Transportation has decided to submit the request in the next budget session and it is expected to be passed by the cabinet. (3rd China United Press Telegram)</p>

Liu and Zhang arrived in Beiping this afternoon from Nanjing to meet with Ling Xiao. Staff Officer Zhao Xun, sent by the Military Sub-Committee to Qingdao for investigation, has now arrived in Weihaiwei. Because Liu Tianfu and others have arrived in Beiping, Shen's representative, Bao Yiming, has postponed his return to Qingdao for a few days. (3rd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Central Committee member Zeng Kuangqing arrived in Nanjing from Sichuan to request instructions from the central government on methods for reorganizing party affairs in Sichuan. He also reported to Chiang Kai-shek and Wang Jingwei on the situation of the communist bandits in Sichuan and the social conditions. He visited Chiang in Jiangxi a few days ago. At 6 PM on the 3rd, he visited Wang. According to Zeng's statement to a Central News Agency reporter, Chiang and Wang attach great importance to the rampant communist bandits in Sichuan and both advocated that Liu Xiang be responsible for leading the various armies to exert their utmost efforts to suppress them in order to stabilize the situation in Sichuan. Wang also said that Liu Xiang would be given the title of Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression, and all armies in Sichuan would be under his control and command. A staff group would also be formed to plan everything in order to achieve rapid results. As for party affairs in Sichuan, after I reported to the central government, the central government has realized where the deep-rooted problems lie. The Central Organization Department has now decided to hire Cao Shushi, Guo Yunlou, Hu Sumin, Chen Ziyu, Wei Tinghe, Peng Lun, Leng Baodong and other seven people as design committee members, and transfer Song Shaozeng and Sun Hudong to Nanjing for other appointments.

<p>(Beiping) Sun Dianying's representative in Beiping, Hu Jiesan, returned to Beiping last night. Today, he visited He Yingqin to request four things: (1) Advance the issuance of the departure order. (2) Instruct the Pinghan Railway Bureau to prepare vehicles. (3) Bandits are constantly appearing in the Chahar-East Yanqing-Shacheng area.

(4) The departure expenses approved by the central government may be insufficient, please consider increasing them appropriately. He Yingqin has agreed to handle it and has instructed the local authorities along the way to provide convenience. Chiang Kai-shek sent a telegram to Sun Lianzhong saying that the issue of military pay will be handled in the same way as the monthly pay received by the Pingfen Association and the various armies in North China.

<p>——Cutting Older and Weaker Soldiers According to Central Government Organization——</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the military uprising in North China, monthly military expenses have reached over 5 million yuan. With the fall of various places in eastern Rehe and the occupation of the Qinhuangdao Customs, monthly revenue in North China has decreased from 3 million to just over 2 million yuan. The 3 million yuan in financial assistance from the central government has been suspended. North China's revenue is only enough to pay military salaries, with a shortfall of 3 million yuan. The authorities are feeling great difficulty in coping with this and are currently discussing reducing troops and lowering military pay. In general, each army will cut older and weaker soldiers according to the central government's organization. Preparations are being made to reduce military pay by 30,000 yuan per army per month. Methods are currently being discussed. (3rd Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) The Independent 22nd Brigade, stationed in Yihuang city, with only over 2,000 soldiers under the command of Bai Tianmin, has been defending the city to the death within the heavy encirclement of the communist 135th Army Group for over twenty days. Because our army was unable to provide support, Brigade Commander Bai continued to fight. The communist soldiers, failing to achieve their goal, retreated back to their lair. The siege of Yihuang has now been lifted through the defense to the death. It is reported that as our army in the five provinces is about to launch a large-scale campaign of suppression, the communist bandits are extremely panicked and their morale is disintegrating. There have been multiple instances of communist soldiers surrendering to our side under strict surveillance every day. Furthermore, communist cadres are also showing signs of retreating to Ruijin headquarters. (2nd Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) It has been decided that the Southern Route Army will combine the large armies of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian provinces to first attack Huichang, and then advance to Yudu and Xingguo. The troops currently stationed in southern Xinfeng have been ordered to advance along separate routes. The 7th and 8th Divisions have also advanced from Xunwu towards the Huichang front. Once the two columns of the 19th Route Army returning to Fujian from Guangdong arrive in Fujian, a general offensive can be launched. The unit under Huang Zhiwen of the 1st Division has dispatched troops to the Chengjiang area to search for and suppress the defeated communist bandits in Xunwu. The Southern Route Army had previously set a day for the general offensive, but it has been postponed due to unforeseen circumstances. Yu Hanmou therefore rushed back to the Dayu headquarters to command. Because the recovery of the communist areas requires the reorganization of government affairs, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek is discussing with Chen Jitang the formation of a Jiangnan Political Affairs Council adopting a committee system with Yu Hanmou as the chairman. The various committee members will be recommended by the Guangdong side for appointment by the central government. This matter is expected to be finalized within a few days.

<h3 id="e48">Details of the Prosperous Peace Steamer Massacre Case Released <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>Detailed Information Distributed by the Dalian Japanese Police Department</p>
<p>(Dalian) It is now known that one of the perpetrators of the Prosperous Peace massacre, a man named Daoding, was a friend of the Prosperous Peace captain, Wickmann. He used to work for Xiao's Steamboat Company in Andong, but was recently dismissed by manager Xiao John due to a grounding accident involving the Xingfu (transliterated) steamboat, which Daoding had sailed from Andong to Dalian two months ago. Daoding became unemployed and came to Dalian. The other three perpetrators, one named Dien Weistman, one named Kochi, and one named Miller, arrived in Dalian six days before Daoding. The men stayed in a hotel for about a month. Later, the three men, lacking travel expenses, pestered Daoding. Daoding moved to the Seamen's Union to avoid them. However, these three men continued to press him and conspired with him to rob the Prosperous Peace. Daoding's friend, Li Cheng, associated with bandits, and Daoding was eventually swayed. On June 4, he went to Pantong with Weistman, carrying 500 silver dollars, because Weistman had pawned a pistol at a friend's place and was going to redeem it. Daoding's guilt cannot be absolved. As for what activities Kochi and Miller were engaged in at that time, it is not yet known. Another perpetrator named Xu Le apparently joined in Tianjin. Before Daoding became involved with Xiao's Steamboat Company, he had worked for various companies. He has been in the shipping industry for thirty years. Officials from the German consulate stated that it was hard to believe that Daoding had committed such a massacre. Daoding is a Prussian who is usually polite and has received a good education and possesses philosophical ideas. After Kochi and Miller were arrested, Reuters Dalian reporters were the first to meet them. The two were hiding in the mountains, in thick grass and shrubs, and had twice gone out to buy food and water from Chinese farmers over the course of twenty-eight hours. A Japanese officer happened to be going down the mountain to the city and caught a glimpse of them, and immediately arrested the two. At this time, they were weak and exhausted, and their clothes were completely wet. They surrendered. Neither of them carried any weapons. Kochi is five feet six inches tall, with a sturdy build, a slight mustache, black hair, and a dark complexion. A Reuters reporter offered him a cigarette, which Kochi accepted and smoked calmly, despite being handcuffed. He answered all questions asked by the reporter and stated that he lived at 46 Huishan Road, Shanghai. Miller is slightly taller than Kochi and appears to be very young. He stated that he had worked for the Lulin Trading Company in Shanghai. Kochi answered the reporter's questions and said, "I have killed several Chinese people, but I don't remember how many in total." He also said, "I didn't kill Wickmann. The shooting only lasted about ten minutes. We only wanted to scare them, but they became agitated themselves, so we had to kill them." Kochi also answered questions and said, "We had been planning to rob the ship since last year. This was Daoding's idea. We thought it would definitely succeed, otherwise we would not have attempted it. Our dire situation really drove us crazy." Both said that there were six accomplices in total, one of whom remained in Tianjin. They also said that Daoding did not know Captain Wickmann. Kochi also said that they had four pistols in total, two of which were useless. He threw one into the sea before disembarking in Dalian. He confirmed that they had come to Dalian to purchase food and were going to sail the ship to Valparaiso to sell the cargo and the ship together. However, he did not initially know if there would be a buyer in that port. Kochi continued, "We didn't have time to think when we were killing people. Afterwards, it seemed quite funny, but it was too late to regret it." Before the ship hit the reef, he thought that the job had been completed. Kochi denied that any Chinese people had been imprisoned on the ship until he and his companions left the ship. After landing, he and Miller wandered in the mountains, craving cigarettes. Miller said, "We were initially overjoyed, but what's the use now? It's too late to regret it. I have parents and a sister in Germany. I don't know what they will think when they hear that I'm a thief." All the defendants are single men. Only Kochi is unemployed, and the rest are dissatisfied with their respective occupations. According to their statements, the police department treated them well. Kochi said that one of the five criminals, Xu Le, whose real name is Schroeder, was an engineer at the Shanghai Dentons Trading Company. Another man named Weistman had run a hotel, which closed down at the end of 1932, and had also been a butcher. He lived on Albert Road in Shanghai. (2nd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The police department released details of the Prosperous Peace ship massacre this afternoon, stating that the Prosperous Peace ship loaded 1,800 tons of coal on June 26 before sailing from Dagu to Fuzhou. The German Daoding and his accomplices Müller and four others requested to board the ship as passengers and were granted permission by the captain of the Prosperous Peace. When the ship reached about two hundred miles northeast of Shanghai, the five criminals attacked the crew with guns, killing the Russian captain and his wife, a Russian engineer, a Chinese radio operator, and six Chinese sailors. Their bodies were thrown into the sea. Other details are the same as reported in the previous telegram. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Weistman, one of the perpetrators of the Prosperous Peace massacre, is tall and burly, and his hair has been dyed black. Kochi is a fugitive from Shanghai who was imprisoned in Shanghai for two years. Daoding was captured during the Qingdao campaign in the European War. Miller is from Elberfeld, but Schroeder's nationality is still unknown. (3rd Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Havas dispatch from Paris on the 2nd: This newspaper, Qing Yi Bao, discusses German military preparations, stating that [the National Socialist Party's military organization has been completed. Its detailed organization is known externally. The smallest unit of the National Socialist Party's army is called Sharc, with 20 soldiers commanded by a junior officer, equivalent to a platoon in a regular army. Five Schaarcs combine into a Trupp, equivalent to a company under a first lieutenant in a regular army. Four or five Trupps combine into a Starn, equivalent to a battalion in a regular army. Above that is the StarnBanp, about 1,500 men, equivalent to a regiment in a regular army. The strongest unit of the army is the brigade, which, in addition to regiments, also has other special units, namely: (1) six motorcycle and bicycle squads for reconnaissance and ensuring the safety of the army, equivalent to the old cavalry; (2) 14 bombers skilled in bombing; (3) three engineer squads, each with three connecting links, with motorboats and machine guns, so they are rich in attack capability. Recently, an engineer company has conducted joint exercises with the Steel Helmet Party and the police several times. German Chancellor Hitler said that the groups organized by the Nazi Party are only for domestic police use and have nothing to do with the army. This statement does not match the facts. In reality, Germany's military preparations are extremely strong and prepared for combat. Those who advocate that France should disarm are either criminals or the greatest fools in the world.]</p>

<p>Transferred to Central Government Negotiations; Situation Increasingly Serious</p>
<p>Domei dispatch from Osaka on the 3rd: As a result of the breakdown of negotiations between Staff Officer Izeki of the 4th Division and Police Chief Awaya of the Osaka Prefectural Police over the traffic light incident on the night of the 1st, the situation suddenly worsened. Private First Class Nakamura, who caused the incident, belongs to the 8th Infantry Regiment. Recently, Colonel Matsuda, the regiment commander, issued the following statement in his capacity as unit commander with a resolute determination: "It is extremely regrettable that the Osaka Prefectural authorities lack sincerity, resulting in the breakdown of negotiations. Although this case was due to Private First Class Nakamura's carelessness, it was caused by the police exceeding their authority and committing violence against an active-duty soldier in uniform, which has completely swept away the reputation of the military, causing the case to become increasingly serious. In the future, if there is any such improper police behavior that damages the prestige of the Imperial Army and damages the reputation of soldiers, in order to protect soldiers, it may be necessary to take necessary measures." After Regiment Commander Matsuda issued the statement, he reported to Staff Officer Izeki, who reported to Minister of the Army Araki, who came to Osaka today. At the same time, Division Commander Terauchi of the 4th Division convened a division commander's meeting to discuss the case and then transferred it to the central Ministry of the Army and Ministry of the Interior. The situation is becoming increasingly serious.</p>

<h3 id="e91">Outline of Japan's New Diplomatic Path <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Conspiring to Contact Our Provinces, Attempting to Undermine Unification</p>
<p>Forcing Us to Sign Political, Economic, and Military Alliance with Military Force</p>
<p>Forcing Us to Hand Over National Defense and Security Rights to Japanese Military</p>
<p>Tokyo Correspondence, June 28: The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun published the Japanese government's new diplomatic principles in large headline characters. Its content is not far from the news reported by the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun, but it is more detailed and concrete, expressing the content of its policy of dividing China and wanting to pursue its continental policy with military force. The original text is excerpted below for the reference of the people of the country.</p>
<p>[The diplomatic policy of the Imperial government after withdrawing from the League of Nations, in addition to signing peace treaties with various countries individually, will still gladly participate in international conferences and adopt cooperation with Europe and the United States as its keynote. Recently, in view of the British government's boycotting of Japanese goods, the US government's plan to expand the navy and build large warships, the world economy conference's lack of restraint, and the disarmament conference's inability, the heads of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs deeply know that it was a mistake to focus on conferences centered on Europe and the United States in the past and on diplomacy and international cooperationism. It is necessary to take advantage of the autumn when Europe and the United States are unable to take care of themselves to maintain the right of self-existence of the Far Eastern nations. Based on the principle of the three countries of China, Japan, and Manchuria adopting each other's strengths and supplementing each other's weaknesses, an alliance of the three countries in political, economic, and military affairs is created to prepare for the subsequent invasion of the white races of Europe and the United States. Adopting this principle is a prerequisite, renewing its diplomacy, so that the Empire's diplomacy returns to Asia and pays attention to the permanent solution of the Far Eastern problem. According to this claim, the Asian Division of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered the various agencies stationed in China to contact the central government and local governments of China separately to inquire about their opinions. It abandons the previous diplomacy of direct negotiations with the central government and adopts a diplomatic policy of separate contacts with local areas. To the central government, it contacts Chiang Kai-shek; to the Southwest, it contacts Chen Jitang and Hu Hanmin; to Fujian, it contacts Jiang Guangding; to Hunan, it contacts He Jian; to Hubei, it contacts Xia Douyin; to Shandong, it contacts Han Fuqu; to Beiping, it contacts Huang Fu, etc., and starts direct negotiations separately. The above-mentioned alliances are signed individually with the various local governments, and a standing committee is created to handle all outstanding unresolved issues. It is heard that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has ordered Consul General Hinoh to the Nanjing government, Consul General Nishita to the Shandong Provincial government, Consul General Moriya to the Fujian Provincial government, Consul General Yoshida to the Guangdong Provincial government, Consul General Osaki to the Hubei Provincial government, and Secretary Nakayama to the Beiping Political Committee, etc., to secretly contact. If the various local governments of China agree, formal negotiations may begin in September, and Minister Arima will be ordered to return to the country to contact the negotiating methods.]</p>
<p>Outline of Japan's new Far Eastern diplomatic policy: (1) The Imperial government is still willing to cooperate with Britain and the United States to the extent possible, but in order to ensure the survival rights of the Far Eastern nations, it must wait for the combination of ethnic groups of the same race and the same culture with coexistence and co-prosperity as the basis. In order to achieve its purpose, China's participation is an indispensable condition. China must stand on a proper assessment of the current situation and participate in the political, economic, and military alliance advocated by Japan. (2) In order to achieve the above-mentioned purpose, the Imperial government wants to change the previous diplomatic policy towards China, which centered on the central government. With reference to China's actual situation, it will cooperate with local governments individually. Standing on the principle of coexistence and co-prosperity, if necessary, it will provide spiritual and material assistance. Further, it will sign an alliance of offense and defense with local governments, like the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, and Japan's imperial army will take over China's national defense and maintain China's security, especially the work of suppressing the communist bandits. (3) The above-mentioned policy adopted by the Imperial government does not contain any anti-foreign nature, but the internal forces of China, or the forces of a third country, whether expressed in the form of politics, economy, or ideology, that hinder Japan's policy, the Imperial government will resolutely use military force to eliminate and carry out its original national policy. (4) Various outstanding issues that hinder Sino-Japanese cooperation, such as China's anti-Japanese resistance to goods, the Sino-Japanese Treaty of Commerce, tariff issues, the Nishihara Loans, the suppression of the communists, extraterritorial rights, the recovery of concessions, the Shandong land issue, the opening of important cities as commercial ports, etc., are connected according to their nature either with the central government or with local areas, and a standing committee will be created to solve everything. (5) For local governments with difficult local finances, a credit system for the import of Japanese goods is created with them, and Japan has preparations to respond to their loans. Moreover, in order to form China and Japan into a large economic group, Japan wants to use Japanese cotton yarn, groceries, machinery, seafood, wheat flour, etc., to exchange for China's Daye iron, Shanxi coal, and South China raw cotton, etc. China and Japan adopt each other's strengths and make up for each other's weaknesses to revive the economy of the Far East.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Whereabouts of Three Warships Unknown <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Moving Further Away From Qingdao; Seemingly Heading South</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The naval mutiny in Qingdao has a considerable relationship with the security of the Shandong coast. Provincial Chairman Han Fuqu sent Provincial Committee member Zhang Yue to Qingdao to comfort Mr. Shen and mediate the return of the three naval vessels. Shen did not add any blame. Now the three warships seem to have sailed to Guangdong, and it is not easy to recover them. The coastal security in the future must be planned separately. Shen Honglie originally planned to come to Jinan with Ge Guangting to visit Han and discuss, but because the people of Qingdao had just calmed down, it was inconvenient to leave, so he asked Ge to represent him and come to Jinan to visit Han and report and discuss everything. Ge arrived in Jinan with Qing at 7:40 this morning (the 2nd). Han's representative Zhang Yue also came with him. Han, the Director of the Industry Department Wang Fangting, the Mayor of Jinan Kai Chenglie, and the former Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth Route Army Wang Jinyu, etc., all went to the station to welcome him. After Ge got off the train, he went to the Jiaoji Hotel with Han and the welcomers to rest. The reporter visited and asked about the details of the three warships. Ge answered one by one and recorded them as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Three Ships Sailing South <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Ge stated, "When the three ships first sailed away, they often communicated with Commander Shen by radio, asking Shen to step down. Shen had already agreed. There has been no news in the past three days. Qingdao sent radio messages, but they did not respond. However, according to the length of the radio waves they transmitted before, the three ships are getting farther and farther away from Qingdao and seem to be heading south, and are thousands of miles away from our country's coast. There are many merchant ships traveling between Qingdao, Dalian, and Shanghai, but no trace of these ships has been seen, because they are afraid of being pursued, so they are far away from the coast. As for the reason for sailing to Guangdong, it is because of the previous Laoshan incident. The person who took the initiative to harm Shen was a Cantonese captain Fang, who is now the commander of a Cantonese fort. Fang was the former education chief of the Huludao Naval Academy. The perpetrators this time were all Huludao students and had a considerable relationship with Fang. The three ships have enough coal to use, and although there is not much fresh water, they can barely use seawater to relieve the emergency.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Shen's Attitude <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>After the incident, Mayor Shen immediately telegraphed the central government to resign from all his positions. The central government sent a telegram of comfort and retention. Chairman Han also sent Committee Member Zhang (Yue) to comfort and retain him. I once advised Mr. Shen with Committee Member Zhang not to resign. Shen said that now, in order to be responsible to the end, he would never rush to leave again, because although the three ships have left, many of their family members are still in Qingdao. They are actually colleagues in distress for more than ten years. Now, although they have betrayed me, I will never betray them. I will definitely arrange for their family members properly, and the Qingdao municipal administration must also be handled, so as long as I am in office for one day, I will be responsible for one day. Qingdao is now as calm as ever. The consuls of various countries and the naval commanders of various countries were all surprised by this incident, and expressed their sympathy to Mayor Shen. It is not difficult to chase back the three ships, but Mayor Shen is taking into account the dignity of the country and is unwilling to do this. My visit to Jinan this time is to report to Chairman Han on behalf of Mayor Shen and contact everything. It will take three or two days before I can return to Qingdao."</p>
<h3 id="e95">The True Cause of the Incident <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The reasons for this incident have been published in various reports, but they are nothing more than the Laoshan incident last year. Those who saved Shen asked for excessive rewards, and Shen was unwilling to use the country's salary to make personal entertainment, so they harbored resentment. For example, Feng Zhichong, who stabbed Shen, was only a junior officer at the time, and afterwards asked to be the director of the port administration and the transportation office and the captain of the security brigade, but Shen did not approve them. In less than a year, he was promoted to senior officer, but was still dissatisfied. Guan, who worked the hardest to save Shen, was given 8,000 yuan by Shen afterwards, but he was also dissatisfied. The conspiracy to overthrow Shen was not a one-day affair. Although there was no background in advance this time, there was definitely a plan, which can be proved by the simultaneous departure of the three ships. However, Ling Xiao, who plotted to harm Shen the year before last, is now in Beiping and does not seem to have heard about this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Han Fuqu Speaks <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>I originally intended to mediate in the middle so that the three ships could return, and Mayor Shen would not add any blame to them. Now that they have gone far and have not seen a reply, Mayor Shen has also not sent a reply. All the details are not very clear. After Committee Chairman Ge (Guangting) came to Jinan, I heard the details. However, I advised Shen not to resign as mayor, and Shen has indicated that he will no longer insist on resigning.

<h3 id="e97">The Current Situation in Guizhou Province <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Guizhou Representative in Guangdong Talks About Military Affairs and Transportation; Hunan Plane Suddenly Flees to Guizhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Since Guizhou Province joined the Southwest Political Group, Wang Jialie and the Southwest provinces have been in constant contact with messengers. Zhang Yunliang, the Guizhou representative stationed in Guangdong, and Wang Jizhi, the director of the Guangdong Office of the 25th Army, went to Guilin in mid-June on official business to discuss everything with the Guilin authorities. Recently, after the matter was completed, they returned to Guangdong from Guilin on the 26th. According to reports, the recent situation in Guizhou is as follows: The internal disputes in Guizhou will soon be pacified. Jiang Zaizhen is now leading hundreds of people to retreat to Youxiu, Sichuan. Che Mingyi's troops also fled to western Hunan. There is now nothing wrong in northeastern Guizhou. Wang Jialie has now sent Wang Tianxi to lead six regiments of troops to garrison eastern Guizhou, but Nu Gang, Peng Gongwu, Nian Gongzhi, etc., are still arguing over the King of Guizhou and entered Guizhou on the 19th of this month to be responsible for mediation. The problem of disputes can be resolved within a month. In order to appease the local area, Wang Jialie has now appointed Wang Tianxi as the Commander of the East Road Appeasement, Bai Huizhang as the Commander of the South Road Appeasement, He Zhizhong as the Commander of the West Road Appeasement, and Liao Huaizhong as the Commander of the North Road Appeasement, and limited them to complete the appeasement work within two months. In addition, the method of Guilin in Guangdong is imitated, and militia regiments are compiled and trained in districts. Wang Jialie concurrently serves as the Commander-in-Chief of the Provincial Militia Regiment, and Jiang Guofan is the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. They were both sworn in on May 25 and implemented the compilation and training of self-defense forces. As for transportation, because the Danchi Highway in Guilin Province will soon be opened to traffic, the Guizhou authorities have ordered the Highway Bureau to repair the Guinan Highway so that it can be connected and coordinated with the Guilin Highway to facilitate transportation between Guizhou and Guilin provinces. In the past, Guizhou-Guilin wired telegraphs had to be relayed by Hunan Province, which was very inconvenient. In order to improve it, Guizhou Province is now erecting telegraph lines in Dushan to directly reach Nandan in Guilin Province. In the future, Guizhou-Guilin communications can be directly reached at any time, which is a further step. The civil aviation between Guizhou and Guilin is being planned to facilitate transportation and transmission. This matter is being actively handled by the Guizhou and Guilin authorities and can be realized in the near future.</p>
<p>In addition, it is reported that a negotiation incident has recently occurred between Guizhou and Hunan. The reason is that in mid-June, Hunan's He Jian ordered the Changsha Aviation Office to send a plane to the border area for reconnaissance because Xiangxi in Hunan Province was bordering Guizhou Province and the two factions of Wang and Liu in Guizhou Province were fighting and stray soldiers and bandits often ran into Xiangxi. Huang Fei, the director of the aviation office, ordered Deputy Captain Zhou Yiping to drive a single-wing plane called "Lange" to conduct reconnaissance in the Xiangxi area. The plane went missing after that. The Hunan authorities telegraphed various parties to inquire. It was not until mid-June that they received a report that the plane Lange had fled to Guizhou Province and the pilot had been appointed as the captain of the Guizhou Aviation Team, etc. Another rumor is that the plane fled to Guizhou due to a large sum of money. Now He Jian has filed a serious negotiation, and it is unknown how it will end. (June 28)</p>
<h3 id="e98">Bandit Forces Expand; War Between Sichuan Commanders Breaks Out Again <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wenhui Actively Attacks Chongqing; Liu Xiang Goes to Longchang to Fight</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: According to Sichuan news, the war between Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou in Sichuan Province has been going on for many days and there is still no hope of resolution, and Xu Xiangqian's remnant bandits have taken the opportunity to instigate and come. Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, and Guangyuan have been captured in succession. The people suffer from the scourge of war and are repeatedly robbed by bandits. The wounds are deep and unparalleled. After the bloody battle of Bihe, Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou's troops have been exhausted. Tian Songyao's troops, which also served as bandits, also felt overwhelmed. Liu Cunhou and Yang Sen's strength is not much more, and they are even less worthy of mention. The only one who is capable of suppressing bandits and can be a weight for Liu Deng is Liu Xiang. Liu has the name of Commissioner of Post-War Affairs in the entire province and has long thought about encompassing the entire Sichuan and fulfilling his dream of armed unification. Although the Liu Deng war has its own main reason and was not necessarily caused by Liu Xiang's instigation, it is undeniable that Liu Xiang wants them to clash in order to profit from the fishermen. However, the central government only ordered to be responsible for mediation and never entrusted with the power to specialize in conquests. The army has been sent, but they still dare not actually join the war group, nurturing their strength and waiting for the time, which is not without reason. Recently, Liu Xiang convened a meeting of representatives of the various armies in Chongqing and decided to use troops against Liu Wenhui and formulated a fundamental plan for suppressing bandits and quelling chaos in Sichuan Province. He entrusted Zeng Kuoqing to go to Nanchang to ask Chiang for instructions. On the one hand, he transferred troops and generals, plagiarizing Liu Wenhui's back road, and implementing the so-called armed sanctions. However, Liu Wenhui had also expected this and deployed defenses in Qianwei, Jiajiang, Renshou, and Jingyan. He sent troops to attack Chongqing and appointed six route commanders. On Liu Xiang's side, Liu himself has been stationed in Longchang, taking three routes forward. Tang Shizun, Pan Wenhua, and other troops came from Zigong and attacked Jiajiang as the middle route. Fan Shaozeng, Wang Zhiyi, and other troops came from Zizhong and Neijiang. Luo Zezhou and Li Qixiang came from Anyue and Lezhi and attacked Renshou and Jianyang as the right route. Another unit was sent from Xufu to Qianwei, side attacking Jiajiang as the left route, and a circular was sent to northern Sichuan, asking Deng, Tian, Yang, and Liu to advance their troops at the same time. Looking at the entire Sichuan situation, it is all in the midst of war. Qianwei, Jiajiang, Renshou, and Jingyan are again the battlegrounds for the two Liu's competition. (July 1)</p>

<p>Zhu Chenguang, the head of the second district of this county, was accused by someone to the provincial government for unclear accounts and other reasons. Zhu also left his post and went elsewhere. The county government therefore appointed Xu Biren, an employee of the district office, to temporarily replace him. Unexpectedly, Zhu suddenly returned the day before yesterday, intending to continue his duties. Unexpectedly, a provincial telegram also arrived, ordering the dismissal and investigation of the district head, and appointing Shi Zhongzheng to fill the vacancy. Shi arrived in Pinghu on the same day and stayed at the Tongan Hotel. He will go to take over in a few days. Zhu Chenguang, it is said, will be detained and investigated after his handover.</p>

At that time, two more bandit ships came, with dozens of bandits armed with rifles and cannons. They immediately boarded the ship and rushed into the cabin. All the passengers on the ship were searched and robbed, none spared. They also ordered the ship's purser to hand over 500 yuan in cash, and because he was slow to hand it over, he was seriously wounded by the bandits. The looting lasted two hours before they left.

<p>Since the banning of prostitution in Suzhou, there have been many private prostitutes. Han Zhuang, set up by the famous "Queen of Flesh" Li Sanyuan in Sanxianci Lane in the northern district of the city, is a leader in this industry. Many young girls are kept there. Li also trafficks in human beings to places such as Amoy and Xiamen, where she has branch organizations. The night before (the 2nd), Wang, a staff member of the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau, was at the Continental Hotel in Guanqian on business. He saw a young girl with a charming appearance wandering around. He inquired about her background and learned that her name was Zhu Xiu, and that she lived at No. 4 Aishou Lane, Meibaike Road, Shanghai. She had been lured to Suzhou from Shanghai by Li Sanyuan and forced to receive guests. Wang was very interested when he heard the name Li Sanyuan, so he opened a separate room and hired a waiter to take notes in detail. Zhu did not know that Wang was a staff member of the Public Security Bureau, so she answered the questions in great detail. After the interview, Wang immediately asked Zhu to sign and hand it over to the detective team. The detective police were dispatched to search Sanxianci Lane. Four young girls were also found in Li Sanyuan's home. After interrogation, it was learned that these people would soon be trafficked to Xiamen by Li. Many letters about Li's human trafficking were also seized. However, Li Sanyuan herself was at large and has not been apprehended.</p>

<p>After Han Wentai, the head of Xuxie Township in Zhouxin Town, the Third District (Yangming Township) of the county, was kidnapped on March 20 of this year, he was torn apart and dismembered into three pieces. Wu Zhengrong, the county government's police chief, disguised himself and went to the countryside four times to arrest the bandits. On the 2nd of this month, Yang Abao (also known as Zhou Abao), a bandit who was in charge of watching the hostage in this case, was apprehended in Zhoujiage, Zhangjingqiao in the Seventh District. Han's body has been exhumed and is being guarded by Tu Zheng Chen Xiangsheng and two police officers. It was reported in this newspaper that at about 7 p.m. on the same day, Gu Wei, the head of the Zhangjingqiao Security Corps in the district, also captured a kidnapper named Zhou Rengen at the Zhangjingqiao Navigation Wharf. After questioning, the suspect, who was using the alias Zhou Zihe, confessed to being in charge of delivering messages between the city and the countryside in the kidnapping of Han Wentai. After obtaining the confession, Captain Gu immediately reported it to the county government for verification. When Han's family heard the news of Han Wentai's tearing ticket, they couldn't help but burst into tears and were distraught. Han Zekeliang, along with his mother, went to the site where the body was exhumed to identify the body and await forensic examination. Zhou Rengen, one of the rural bandits who had been apprehended, was escorted to the county government yesterday by Captain Gu for interrogation.</p>

<h3 id="e113">House Tax on Roads Crossing North Sichuan Road to be Collected According to Regulations <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Public Security and Finance Bureaus Issue Joint Announcement</p>
<p>According to a person in charge of the Finance Bureau yesterday, the case of house tax on roads crossing North Sichuan Road has been instructed by the Municipal Government to continue to be collected according to regulations. The Public Security Bureau is currently being notified and members are being assigned to collect. The report in yesterday's newspaper, which stated that the Finance Bureau and other bureaus exchanged opinions and contacted the relevant parties separately, is not true. The joint announcement of the Public Security and Finance Bureaus is recorded as follows: Announcement of the Joint Announcement: It is hereby announced that the Municipal Government's Order No. 6030 states, "It is hereby ordered that the Municipal Government's 240th Municipal Affairs Meeting has resolved that the house tax in the area of North Sichuan Road and Laobazi Road should still be persuaded to be paid. Those who incite or abet resistance to taxation should be dealt with according to law," which is on file. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau, it is hereby recorded and ordered that the bureau immediately comply with and handle it properly. Upon receipt of this order, it was found that the citizens in the North Sichuan Road area have made many requests for the house tax that should be paid, hoping to be spared. There is still some misunderstanding of this case. It must be known that the house tax is the cost of municipal construction and is the common obligation of all citizens. The area of North Sichuan Road has long been subject to police power, and public facilities such as water and electricity can also be supplied by the urban area. The citizens in that area have enjoyed the benefits of municipal facilities for many years and have never fulfilled their obligation to pay taxes. In other words, the citizens in the south city, Zhabei, and other districts of this city indirectly bear the burden. It is unreasonable to say that it is fair. The Finance Bureau of this city is in charge of taxes and fees, and is impartial. The purpose of opening up the house tax in that area this time is to equalize the burden on citizens and indirectly protect the interests of the majority of citizens. It is necessary to start collecting taxes on a regular basis. The citizens in that area should actively comply with and pay taxes to show fairness. If they claim that the commerce is depressed after the war and do not pay the house tax, then the spring and summer house taxes in the war zone of this city in the 21st year were exempted by the Municipal Government in June of the previous year. This has now become a past fact, and this reason cannot be established. As for the statement that the area is an extraterritorial road construction and must be paid after the extraterritorial road problem is resolved, it is even more unreasonable. The citizens who live in the extraterritorial road construction area, because the municipal public facilities have not yet reached, and are now using the water and electricity of the special zone, and paying the house tax of the special zone, this city is temporarily no longer collecting taxes in order to relieve the difficulties of the people, so as to avoid the burden of repetition. Now that the facts are different, it is not appropriate to discuss them together. There must be no shortage of citizens who are well aware of the truth and can understand this purpose. The aforementioned reasons for the order have been issued by the Finance Bureau to the Municipal Tax Collection Office to collect taxes according to regulations, and the Public Security Bureau has ordered the district offices in charge to assist in the handling. We are sincerely afraid that someone will incite and obstruct the collection of taxes. Therefore, we have jointly issued an announcement, urging the citizens to embrace the concept of municipal administration and pay the house tax as soon as possible, and not to lightly believe in rumors and delay any further. We have high hopes for the bureaus, etc. This announcement.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Yu Hongjun and Fei Dun Continued to Discuss Factory Inspection Yesterday <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Discussion on One Part of the Three Key Points Fei Xindun's Talk Shows Slight Progress It is reported that the Department of Industry and the Municipal Government have completed the discussion on the method of factory inspection in the Public Concession. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, visited Fei Xindun, Director of the Public Works Bureau, yesterday afternoon. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e115">Key Points of the Method <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The key points of the method discussed by Secretary-General Yu and Director Fei were announced yesterday by the Labor Department of the Ministry of Industry in Beijing, namely ㈠ The two parties form a committee with seven members, four from our side and three from the Public Works Bureau. The chairman belongs to us, the vice-chairman belongs to them, and the salaries of the staff are borne equally. ㈡ Chinese labor laws can be implemented in the concession. ㈢ Regarding violations of Chinese labor laws, the power to prosecute and punish is exercised by the Chinese local court. When the reporter asked Mr. Yu about the above three key points yesterday, he did not deny them, but thought that it was too early to publish them before they were resolved.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Yu Visits Fei <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>After the method was drafted, the Municipal Government consulted the Ministry of Industry for opinions and made two revisions. Now it has been agreed, so Secretary-General Yu personally visited Director Fei Xindun of the Public Works Bureau at 3 p.m. yesterday. The conversation was very short, only about a quarter of an hour, and Yu left.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Fei Xindun's Talk <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Guowen News Agency reporter then submitted a letter to meet Mr. Fei to inquire whether this was a formal negotiation. He replied that there was no such thing as a formal negotiation, and that we were always exchanging opinions and discussing major issues. The reporter asked whether there was any progress in today's discussion. Fei replied, "Slight progress." Fei expressed his opinion that it was too early to publish the key points of the method to the Beijing News. The reporter then asked whether the meeting today was about the key points of the method in the Beijing News. Fei replied that the discussion between Secretary-General Yu and I was only part of it, not a complete discussion, because this matter still requires several discussions. Finally, the reporter asked whether a date for another meeting had been scheduled. He replied that Yu and I often visited each other, so the date of the next meeting has not been set.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Labor Unrest Occurred Among Workers at Shanghai Electric Power Company New Plant Yesterday <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>A worker in the furnace room fell to his death, and fellow workers in the same factory requested compensation on his behalf. As a result of mediation, work was resumed this morning. Workers at the new plant of the Shanghai Electric Power Company in the Yangshupu Public Concession have been unable to resolve the issue of compensation for workers who died on duty for a long time.</p>
<p>After the county refused to give a definite answer, it was proposed to each other yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e119">First Letter from the Public Works Bureau Ordering the Yi Yuan Rubber Factory to Stop Operations <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The reason given was that the factory building was not properly constructed. The union decided to petition the Party organs this morning.</p>
<p>The Yi Yuan Rubber Factory on North Chengdu Road in this port was ordered to move by the Public Works Bureau because the Public Works Bureau considered that the factory building was not suitable for manufacturing rubber. After reluctantly announcing the suspension of operations the day before yesterday, the workers were panicked. The union held a meeting yesterday to discuss and decided to petition the party and government organs this morning. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e120">Letter from the Public Works Bureau <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession notified the factory to move the building, saying, "Respectfully, the acting director of the Fire Department of this bureau once stated that the building of the Yi Yuan Rubber and Leather Manufacturing Factory at No. 1002 North Chengdu Road is completely unsuitable for manufacturing rubber products and that the factory should be moved to a more suitable building, etc. In the three letters to your company on May 11, 18, and 19 of this year, you were warned. Now, I am writing to inform you again that the dangerous nature of the materials used in your factory, the conditions under which work is carried out, and the improper construction of the factory building are all sufficient to endanger life and property. If there is no sufficient and satisfactory safety guarantee for this dangerous operation, this bureau will not allow it to continue. If you do not believe that the building is sufficient for all current uses within three weeks, the bureau will file a lawsuit and exercise all its powers to prevent public danger."</p>
<h3 id="e121">Announcement of Closure <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the notice from the Public Works Bureau, the factory announced the closure of the factory on the 29th of last month. The original text reads, "Publicly, the factory has been notified by the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession that the structure of the factory building is not in compliance with the requirements and is limited to moving the factory within three weeks. The factory has repeatedly sent personnel to negotiate, but without success. It has now been decided to suspend operations from July 1. All workers are requested to register with the manager's office, fill in their addresses, and wait for the factory to find a new site and resume operations before notifying them to return to work. Those who voluntarily do not return to the factory or find another job midway are also free to do so. However, due to the forced suspension of operations, relocation, and site search by this factory, the losses will be huge, and the suspension of operations of the workers is deeply regrettable. However, there is nothing that can be done, except to wait for the establishment of a new factory before notifying them. This announcement."</p>
<h3 id="e122">Union Mediation <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the news, the workers opposed the factory's closure because the factory still had a four-year lease contract for the building, and reported it to the Third District Rubber Union for mediation. The union sent Xu Yongjia, Chen Zhikang, Liang Yongyi, and others to the factory for mediation at 1 p.m. yesterday, but the manager, Huang Yongqin, was out, resulting in no results.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Petition Today <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The union considered the situation to be serious and held an emergency meeting at the Da Wang Temple at 1:20 p.m. yesterday. More than 230 members attended, chaired by Chen Zhikang. After the chairman reported on the situation, the discussion began. It was decided ㈠ How should the sudden announcement of the factory closure affect the livelihood of the workers? It was decided (A) to submit a report to the Party and government for relief (B) and to schedule a petition to the Party and government by all on the 4th. ㈡ Should representatives be appointed to be responsible for the negotiation? It was decided to appoint Chen Zhikang, He Jinyu, Li Jiafu, Li Zanqian, Gao Huizhen, Shen Yiyun, Shen Zhukang, Yao Shouren, Wang Rensheng, Wu Jinfu, Hu Qiaodi, Shen Agen, Wu Meirong, and other 13 people to handle the matter together with the union. ㈢ How should the Public Works Bureau's unauthorized order to close the Yi Yuan Factory, which resulted in the loss of livelihood of all workers, be dealt with? It was decided (secret) ㈣ Should workers register after the factory closes in order to compile statistics? It was decided to hand it over to the Organization Department to start registration and to petition the Municipal Government, the Municipal Party Department, and the Social Affairs Bureau at 9 a.m. today.</p>
<p>After the implementation of the work slowdown, the detective house mediated and agreed to work as usual from today, and the factory and workers formally consulted on the 5th of this month, and the strike was resolved. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e124">Worker Dies <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>At about 2:40 p.m. on the 25th of last month, a worker in the third furnace room of the factory, a local man named Zhou (name unknown), 25 years old, was working next to a 20-foot-high furnace on that day. Several other workers were sending iron plates past him. Zhou saw that the place was narrow, so he rested against a decayed piece of bamboo, which broke, and Zhou fell down with it. His head hit a nail, which penetrated deep inside, and blood flowed like a stream. Although the factory's resident doctor tried to save him, it was ineffective, and he died on the spot.</p>
<h3 id="e125">Request for Compensation <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>After the incident, the workers believed that Zhou's death was due to work-related causes and asked the factory to provide generous compensation and allocate 2,000 yuan in compensation. The factory agreed to consider it. Recently, the representatives of the workers learned that the factory only agreed to provide 200 yuan in compensation, and believed that the factory was intentionally disregarding human life. Therefore, from 1 p.m. yesterday, more than 800 people from the copper workshop, electrical workshop, furnace room, workshop, and all the department chiefs and day laborers, all went on strike to promote the company's awareness. However, in order to maintain the traffic of current, about 400 workers of the three shifts in each workshop and department still worked as usual to avoid affecting the local area.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Police Prepared <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>At the same time, the workers sent representatives to negotiate with the factory, but the factory manager, Mr. Hoppergen, had returned to the United States, and the acting factory manager, Haierte, also said that he could not answer immediately. Therefore, the workers insisted. The incident was learned by the nearby Lan Road Police Station, which believed that the work slowdown was serious, and sent a large number of Chinese and Western detectives and special police cars to guard the area. Fortunately, the striking workers strictly maintained order, so no incidents occurred. The special police also advised the workers to mediate.</p>
<p>By 5 p.m., it was time to leave work as usual, but the striking workers</p>
<p>Did not want to leave the factory.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Resume Work This Morning <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>By 5:30 p.m., the acting factory manager, Haierte, agreed to the workers' request to reply on the 5th (Wednesday) and ordered the election of two foremen representatives and three worker representatives to negotiate with the factory manager. The special police informed all the workers of the above method, who were satisfied and stopped the slowdown. However, at that time, it was time to leave work, and all the workers left the factory as usual, deciding to work as usual from today.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Elected Representatives <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>All the workers on the spot elected five representatives to wait for the factory manager's reply on the 5th: Wang Xingen, Yang Shaogen, Chen Baogen, Ni Wenfu, and Shang Shi, and decided to strictly maintain order and wait for the reply.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Real Estate Association Writes to Public Works Bureau Requesting No High Land Value Assessment <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the Real Estate Association of this city received a letter from Dun Yu Real Estate Company and other members yesterday, reporting that the Donation Office of the Public Works Bureau recently sent people to arbitrarily overestimate land values in the eastern district by more than 60% in order to increase tax revenue and oppress property owners by all means. Therefore, they sent a letter to the association, requesting it to protest to the Public Works Bureau and quickly stop the high land value assessment behavior to reduce the burden and relieve commercial difficulties. Therefore, the association immediately wrote to the Public Works Bureau, stating: "Since the Shanghai Incident of January 28, the commercial depression and the people's livelihood in the eastern district have been exhausted. At a time when the world economy is declining, this city is also affected. Although the houses in the district are dense, the empty houses account for three or four tenths. If this continues, the property owners themselves will find it difficult to maintain. Moreover, the problem of tap water has increased due to the high valuation of rent, which has been delayed and cannot be resolved. If the land value is overestimated, the donation amount and water price will increase at the same time, which will inevitably lead to disputes between citizens and property owners, which is a major hidden danger in society. Therefore, we sincerely request that the proposal to overestimate land values this time be canceled to relieve commercial difficulties."</p>
<h3 id="e130">Su Bingwen Talks About Planning to Settle His Subordinates <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Decided to Send People to Investigate First and Then Ask for Relief</p>
<p>General Su Bingwen, accompanied by Fan Ruizheng, representative stationed in Beiping, Wang Erlu, commander of the Hulunbuir garrison, Gai Xingya, secretary, Wu Delin, brigade commander, and an adjutant, arrived in Shanghai from Hangzhou by car at about 4 p.m. the day before yesterday. The Central News Agency reporter visited General Su at his residence yesterday morning and made the following remarks:</p>
<h3 id="e131">Mission This Time <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>According to General Su, this time he went to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to report on the anti-Japanese war. The issue of settling his subordinates has not yet been discussed. The families of the generals and those compatriots who are unwilling to be slaves to a conquered country, who returned from Russia, are scattered in Xinjiang, Beiping, Shanghai, and other places, displaced and homeless. When I think of the fact that the anti-Japanese war has not yet succeeded and the territory is still in the hands of the enemy, and that my comrades have suffered such a catastrophe, I feel uneasy and distressed. Therefore, I came to Shanghai to plan a settlement plan. However, this matter is a major one and it is not easy to solve. It still needs to be considered in the long term. Now it has been decided to send people to Xinjiang, Beiping, and other places to investigate the number of people and then request the central government to provide relief.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Observation of Bandit Suppression <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>When I went to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the bandit suppression military situation was extremely tense. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek held meetings to suppress bandits for eight or nine hours a day, which was too hard, resulting in slight discomfort. The bandits in Jiangxi Province should not be underestimated. The bandit suppression army is about 200,000 people, and the work is progressing smoothly. The failure of the anti-Japanese military affairs in North China this time and the disturbances in the rear by the Jiangxi bandits were a major reason. If there were no communist bandits jumping beams internally, at least 100,000 troops could be drawn north to resist Japan, and the anti-Japanese military affairs would not have failed. From this, we can know the importance of the bandit suppression military affairs. Domestic security is the beginning of external resistance. The bandit suppression is actually the same goal by different routes and there is no distinction.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Request for Punishment <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>I am a soldier and have the duty to defend the territory. Last year, I fought bitterly in the Manchukuo and Heilongjiang area for several months, but I was unable to protect the national territory, resulting in my exile overseas. This time, I returned to the country and went to Nanjing to plead guilty to the central government and request punishment. I was deeply ashamed that the central government remembered the spirit of resistance against Japan in the past, did not add punishment, and still appointed me as a member of the Military Commission. When I was in Lushan, I received a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek informing me that the Central Political Committee had elected Chairman Ma and me as members of the Military Commission. We have telegraphed to thank you, and the official order has not yet been received.</p>
<h3 id="e134">No Intention to Go to Xinjiang <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>When my troops returned to the country from Russia via Xinjiang, there was a riot in Xinjiang Province. The capital of Xinjiang issued a small number of firearms and instructed the subordinates to stay in Xinjiang to maintain order and protect the country and defend the people. It was the duty of a soldier, so the troops stayed in Xinjiang for several months to maintain law and order, which has been highly praised by the authorities and the people. When I met Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek asked me whether I would like to go to Xinjiang to inspect my subordinates. However, I have recently been suffering from a cold and feel very uncomfortable, so I have no intention of going to Xinjiang so far.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Personal Position <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>I have always held a determination to sacrifice myself. Death is not a pity, and I have no further hopes. Therefore, I have no prejudice or desire regarding my personal fate. As long as it benefits the country and the nation, I will not hesitate to go through fire and water. I am a soldier, and my future actions will follow the orders and commands of the government.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Future Hopes <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>At this time of national crisis, the 30 million people of the Northeast are still suffering in dire straits. The land of the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe is still under the iron hooves of the enemy. The people of the country should quickly awaken, unite sincerely, and work together to resist foreign aggression. With years of hard work, it is hoped that we can recover the lost territories.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Meeting with Ma and Zhang <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>After General Su arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday, he went to meet with General Ma Zhanshan that evening to discuss the placement of his subordinates. Yesterday morning around 11:00 AM, he received General Zhang Dianjiu and many of his subordinates at his residence. It is expected that he will stay in Shanghai for several days.</p>

<p>Shao Chuan (Fu Chu), my esteemed ambassador, I have long admired your talent in diplomacy and have always looked up to you with sincere admiration. Our friendship has been established for years, as if it were just yesterday. This time, when passing through Europe, I sincerely wanted to visit you to seek your guidance, but due to my eagerness to return, I was unable to do so. I am grateful for your sending personnel to express your condolences with such care and consideration. After boarding the ship in Italy, I sailed for more than two weeks and safely arrived on the banks of the Huangpu River on the fifth of last month. On the sixth, I took a train to Beijing and then to Nanchang to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek. After a brief rest in Mount Lu for a little over ten days, I hastily traveled east to Shanghai the day before yesterday because my troops were staying in Shanghai and needed to be settled. With the fatigue of travel and lack of time, I apologize for the delay in writing this letter. I am grateful for your kindness and trust you will understand. With the skies in view, I cannot express my reluctance to depart. I respectfully wish you good health.</p>

<p>Xi Dejiong, Director of the Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission, inspected the dikes in Hubei and Wuhan due to the rapid rise of the river and ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to handle flood control matters, personally supervising without sparing any effort. Yesterday, the Engineering Department of the commission received a telegram from Xi: (abridged above) The water level in Hankou today has receded to 46 feet. The water level in the upstream ports has fluctuated slightly. The dangerous parts have also been rescued from danger. In the winter, he will go downstream to inspect. Except for the Fan Gate and Xiao Gong Gate of Fengzhi, which are still being rescued, the rest have escaped danger. The danger of the summer flood in the dikes of Hubei Province has passed. However, in the area of Jiangxi and Anhui, the water level is decreasing very slowly. The rising of Poyang Lake hinders the flow of the river, and the danger is slightly more serious than in Wuhan.

<h3 id="e151">The United Reserve of Banking Industry Will Issue New Public Notes Starting Today <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Promoting the convenience of commerce and advocating the bill discount system</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the United Reserve Committee public notes of the Shanghai Banking Association will be issued by the committee's member banks with signatures and paid by the committee. It has been a year since the issuance. Recently, in order to increase convenience, the committee's member banks have unanimously resolved to revise the format of the public notes and the public note regulations separately, and they will be issued starting today. The advantages of this new public note are: (1) The old public note was limited to immediate payment, and its use was only convenient among financial institutions. The new public note can be opened for forward delivery and can adapt to the needs of commerce. The original was a check style, but now it is a draft style. (2) The amount of the old public note was a fixed whole number. The new public note has a limited amount per sheet, and the bank can freely fill it within the limit, similar to a traveler's check. (3) The old public note only had Chinese characters. The new public note is in both Chinese and English. Shanghai is an international commercial port, and the commercial relationship between China and foreign countries is very close. Now, including English, it can circulate more smoothly. (4) In addition to retaining the original interbank lending system, the new public note can be discounted by the holder to the committee before it expires. The forward payment can be changed to cash immediately. It is not only a solid guarantee, but also a lively nature, which can be adjusted in commerce. (5) The discounting of commercial paper has been advocated by the Chinese banking industry for many years, but it has not yet developed. The discounting of public notes is handled by the committee, which is no different from the banks handling it themselves. It can be a pioneer in the discounting of commercial paper. The reporter from the New Voice News Agency specifically visited Zhu Boquan, the manager of the committee, yesterday. According to him, the lending rate on July 4 was 1.4 cents per 1,000 yuan per day, and the discount rate was 1.2 cents per 1,000 yuan per day. Both have been predetermined and will be posted daily. He received a sample of the new public note, which is well-printed and comprehensive in form. We will quickly make a plate and publish it below, along with the full text of the revised public note regulations.</p>
<p>Shanghai Banking Association United Reserve Committee Public Note Regulations (Revised on May 25, 1933) Article 1: The member banks of the Shanghai Banking Association United Reserve Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "member banks") shall, in accordance with the provisions of the covenant, take the property deposited with the Shanghai Banking Association United Reserve Committee (hereinafter referred to as the "committee") as the standard to receive public notes from the committee and may issue public notes.

<h3 id="e152">Opening of the Cooperative Enterprise Experimental Zone <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The ceremony was held yesterday at the Second Civilian Residence</p>
<p>The cooperative enterprise experimental zone sponsored by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau held an opening ceremony at the Second Civilian Residence on the west end of Luban Road. Zhu Yuting of the Land Bureau, Zhang Yichen of the Rite Teaching Association, Shen Ruoxu and Xiao Zhiqing of the Municipal Farmers' Association, Wu Bochao of the Sixth District Tea Workers' Union, residents Xu Huanwen and Yao Fuwen, cooperative members Chen Busheng, Lv Xin, and Lv Shunjie, Wu Huanru, Zhang Binghui, Wang Gang, Zhang Zhenyuan, Chen Zeyi, and other staff members of the Social Affairs Bureau, as well as more than 300 guests from all walks of life, including Lu Huaiqi, Xu Ziqing, Du Jimei, and Zhang Qiuyu, were present. After the report by Chairman Zhang Binghui, Xin Juexian reported on the establishment of the Second Civilian Residence Cooperative. The Second Civilian Residence in Shanghai was completed in January 1931. All the residents are coolies and laborers. The Director Wang, in view of the difficult living conditions of the residents and the exploitation of the middlemen, proposed on March 3 of the same year to organize the Shanghai Civilian Consumer Cooperative to improve the living conditions of the residents, and it was approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. Subsequently, on March 13, the preparatory office of the cooperative was established, and preparatory personnel were appointed to actively prepare. However, due to the difficult living conditions of the residents, they were unable to join the cooperative. Although Director Wang and the preparatory personnel worked hard to promote it, few people joined. As a result, only 20 people, including Cui Zhaoding, were recruited as basic members. On May 14 of that year, an inaugural meeting was held, and Wang Gengchang and others were elected as directors. They immediately started to work, but the capital was only more than 500 yuan. After purchasing the necessary equipment for the cooperative, there was only more than 300 yuan of working capital left, so the scope of the business, although expanding, was to first set up an oil, sauce, cigarette, paper, and groceries department, which was announced to open on June 1. At the same time, they continued to solicit members in order to gradually expand the business and develop the cooperative. However, things did not go as planned, and nothing was achieved. The business was also very bleak. At that time, it was almost impossible to support it. Later, the board of directors used the method of increasing income and reducing expenditure. In addition to tightening expenses, the firewood, charcoal, barber, and food departments were entrusted to members to operate separately, and a surplus was taken from each month. Thus, the cooperative was able to survive the difficulties. Since then, through the prudent management of the board of directors, a hot water department was added in early January 1932, and the business began to progress. However, not long after, the January 28th Incident occurred, and the residents moved away one after another. On February 4, the cooperative and all departments announced their closure. Later, in April, it was heard that the ceasefire agreement had been concluded, and the cooperative reopened. However, at this time, about 100 households of residents had moved out of the residence due to the war, and the number of consumers suddenly decreased. The business of the cooperative was greatly affected. Although one employee was taken away to try to reduce expenses, it was still difficult to maintain. Some members and directors were also scattered due to the war, which made the strength of the cooperative even weaker. At the same time, the firewood and charcoal and barber departments also closed one after another due to the bleak business. The hot water department also suffered a large loss due to lack of management experience. At this time, the cooperative was like a candle in the wind, surrounded by danger. Later, through the painstaking planning of the directors in office, the hot water department was entrusted to members in May, and the surplus paid by the department each month barely covered the expenses. Thus, the cooperative was able to escape the danger. Not long after, although the food department closed down due to the bleak business, it did not have much impact because the residents gradually moved in and the consumption increased. By November, the business gradually improved, and each month's income, after deducting expenses, still had a slight surplus. However, at this time, the Finance Bureau's reorganization of the rent problem involved the cooperative's hot water department's rental housing. Later, with the maintenance and mediation of the competent authorities, it was able to pass safely. In April of this year, it was ordered to subordinate the cooperative to the cooperative enterprise experimental zone in this city. The name of the cooperative was changed to the Second Civilian Residence Cooperative of the Shanghai Cooperative Enterprise Experimental Zone. On June 3, a members' meeting was convened to discuss the reorganization issue. After the resolution, it was decided to actively reorganize the society. Subsequently, 19 members, including Wang Zhenchang, were recruited, and the first members' meeting after the reorganization was held on June 15. Yi Juexian and others were elected as directors, and it was resolved to take over the old society on June 30 and open the new society on July 3. In terms of business, the credit and consumption departments are currently being operated first. The credit department handles social credit loans, and the consumption department, in addition to the original business, plans to expand the food, firewood, charcoal, barber, food, hot water and other businesses. After a discussion by the board of directors, it was considered that the barber, food, hot water and other businesses lacked management experience and were difficult to operate. Therefore, it was decided to entrust the three businesses of barber, etc., to members to operate separately. All the business surplus of each business unit is reported to the cooperative by the operating members at the end of the month. Thanks to the efforts of the operating members, the three barber, hot water, and food services were able to open on schedule. As for the three items of food, firewood, charcoal, and credit loans, because the cooperative has only raised more than 300 yuan of share capital at present, it is not enough to maintain the original business, and the expansion of the business is still pending. However, the solicitation of the society should continue to be made in order to increase the society's capital and promote the society's affairs. Subsequently, the board of directors resolved to apply to the Social Affairs Bureau for a loan of 800 yuan in accordance with the city's cooperative enterprise experimental plan, using 500 yuan as capital for expanding the food and firewood and charcoal businesses, and 300 yuan as a credit loan fund. As soon as the funds are in place, they will be held immediately. Looking at the situation of the cooperative in the past two years, I don’t know how many difficulties it has gone through. Fortunately, with the efforts and struggles of all the members and the vigorous maintenance of the competent authorities, it has been able to survive to this day. In the future, in addition to hoping that all members will continue to work hard and the competent authorities will do their best to instruct them, I also hope that all sectors will give me guidance from time to time, so that the business of the cooperative can develop day by day, and the cooperative business of this city can also gradually progress. Next, more than ten people, including Zhang Yi, Shen Ruolu, etc., gave speeches, which were slightly longer.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Bulletin of the Central Cholera Prevention Institute <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>First Time</p>
<p>The first bulletin of the Central Cholera Prevention Institute said: (1) Although no true cholera has been found in Shanghai this year, all parties have been asking the institute whether the epidemic has occurred and the prevention procedures of the health agencies. This bulletin briefly describes all the preparations and conditions that have been taken. (2) Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Department of Health, convened a meeting of all health leaders at the First Hospital of the Red Cross Society on Haige Road a few days ago. In addition to Li Tingan, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, Mr. Mildon, Director of the Health Department of the Public Concession Engineering Bureau, Lapo, Director of the Health Department of the French Concession Engineering Bureau, Wu Liande, Director of the Seaport Quarantine Administration, and Yan Fuqing, President of the First Hospital of the Red Cross Society, Mr. Pauls, Representative of the Health Department of the League of Nations in China, also attended. It was resolved to organize two committees, one for immunological research, specializing in exploring the source of infectious diseases, and one for propaganda, specializing in promoting the development of public health education for the people. (3) The two committees have each held two meetings by June 30. The Propaganda Committee resolved that the three health agencies should print more leaflets and advertisements, and publish more articles in Chinese and Western newspapers to attract public attention. In addition, they will borrow radio stations to broadcast speeches by health officials and borrow public places where tourists gather, such as playgrounds and roof gardens, to show cholera films so that everyone can get common sense about cholera prevention and control. (4) The Immunological Research Committee resolved that experts from various health agencies should study various disease problems, such as water analysis, human bacteria mail, stool examination of healthy people and patients with watery diarrhea, clinical diagnosis research, meteorological research, and research. The water inspection team worked at the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine. According to its report, from April to June 25, a total of 85 water samples from the Huangpu, Yangshupu, Xujiahui, Hongkou, and Zhabei rivers were tested, all using bacteriological methods. Although water vibrios were also found in the water, they were different from cholera vibrios after cultivation. This type of water vibrio was also found in the ponds and creeks in Zhabei. This study is still being actively conducted to clarify the relationship with cholera vibrios and its future development. (5) The cholera bacteria mail team has examined hundreds of stools of healthy people, but no cholera vibrios or cholera-like vibrios have been found. Recently, special attention has been paid to the analysis of the stools of patients with watery diarrhea. (6) According to the meteorological research team, in the 47 years of cholera epidemics in Shanghai (from 1886 to 1932), there was a major cholera epidemic every four years, which can be seen in 1887, 1890, 1902, 1914, 1923, 1926, 1929, and 1932. The years 1893, 1909, 1919, and 1925 were slightly different. In the past seven years, high temperatures have favored cholera epidemics, and low temperatures have eliminated cholera, but it cannot be generalized. When there is little rainfall in spring and winter, there will be a major cholera epidemic, and when rainfall increases, less cholera will be found. According to calculations, there was a lot of spring rain in 1933 (this year), so the cholera epidemic should not be severe. (7) Shanghai will have a total of seven cholera hospitals open in early July, with 1,000 beds. We sincerely hope that this year's work will not be as tense as last year. (8) The Shanghai Waterworks Company has agreed to supply drinking water to the poor in the east and west districts to prevent the spread of cholera. The French Concession also has free tap water facilities as last year to supply drinking water. The Shanghai Zhabei Water and Electricity Company also tried to supply drinking water to the poor at the lowest cost to seek popularity. (9) The Public Concession Health Department stated that from July 1, all patients with watery diarrhea must be reported. The Shanghai Municipal Health Laboratory has tested 56 stools of patients with watery diarrhea, but no cholera vibrios have been found so far. (10) Cholera vaccination is very active. Vaccination is free. As of May 31, the number of vaccinations is listed on the left: Shanghai City 93,962, Public Concession 66,723, French Concession 24,626, totaling 185,311. (11) Shanghai has a total of 47 suspected cholera patients, Hankou has two, but after bacterial examination, they are not true cholera. Shantou also reported two cases, Hangzhou four cases, and Yantai one case, but none of them have been examined by bacteria. (12) The Central Cholera Prevention Institute used to issue a bulletin once a week. Now, since there is no cholera outbreak, it is temporarily set to issue a bulletin once a month. The second cholera bulletin will be released in one month. If cholera is found, it will still be changed to a weekly report.</p>

Since the fall of the Eastern Provinces, the national crisis has intensified. I, Kuiyuan, have been entrusted with leading the troops to fight in the remote areas. Since the Japanese bandits have not been eliminated and the lost territories have not been recovered, I am deeply moved and inspired by your remote gift. Now, as we reorganize our forces and await the opportunity, we aim to annihilate the Japanese bandits, wash away our national humiliation, and live up to your expectations. In addition to publishing a thank-you message in the newspaper, I am sending this telegram to express my gratitude.</p>
<p>Sun Kuiyuan, Commander-in-Chief of the Ninth Army Corps and Commander of the Forty-first Army of the North China Army, bows. Qin.</p>

<p>Anqing Swastika Society Reports on Flood Relief</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua, Commander of the Bandit Suppression in Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces, sent a telegram to the Red Swastika Society Shanghai General Office yesterday, requesting disaster relief on behalf of the people of the three provinces. According to a telegram from the Anqing Swastika Branch, the Anhui River flood broke on the "You" day, affecting thousands of people. Relief efforts are underway. The original telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>World Red Swastika Society Shanghai General Office: The border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces has long been plagued by Red bandits, suffering from repeated floods and droughts. The people are unemployed, and food is scarce. The people are in a state of misery, unable to seek death or escape. Although I, Zhenhua, have been transferred to suppress bandits, I am also responsible for relief efforts. At this time of military advancement, if the refugees fleeing from the Red bandits are not immediately taken in and provided with emergency relief, it will not only gather crowds in the war zone and hinder military operations, but also lead to corpses lying everywhere, which is unbearable for benevolent people. Your esteemed office, with compassion and a desire to help, is requested to show concern for the survivors, send personnel with funds to Huangchuan to provide relief, save the victims, and defend the country. This would be a double blessing. I eagerly await your instructions.</p>
<p>Liu Zhenhua bows, Yan Yin.</p>
<p>World Red Swastika Society General Office: The Anhui River flood broke the Guochengtan levee on the "You" day, washing away homes. Thousands of people are exposed to the elements and hungry. Our society is currently distributing emergency relief and preparing for rescue efforts. Reported by the Anqing Red Swastika Society, Yan.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Chamber of Commerce Fourth General Meeting Resolves to Use Chinese for Insurance Documents <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Requesting Government to Order Compliance</p>
<p>Based on the resolutions of the Fourth General Meeting, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Social Bureau yesterday, stating: Regarding the request: The Chamber held its Fourth Members' Representative Meeting on the 25th of this month. The Shoe Leather Nail and Last Trade Association (Yuan Hongjun), the Tree and Rattan Industry Association (Zhu Huainan), and others jointly proposed that insurance documents should uniformly abolish foreign languages and use Chinese. They requested that the relevant authorities promptly issue an order for strict implementation. The petition stated: Regarding the matter of insurance documents uniformly abolishing foreign languages, the Chamber has handled it on record many times. However, various insurance companies have ignored it and have not complied. They still provide policyholders with documents written in foreign languages as valid proof. After policyholders obtain these incomprehensible foreign documents, they are completely ignorant of the records and conditions within the policy. In the event of an accident, the insurer uses these one-sided words and misinterpreted texts to evade all responsibility and act as a shield for deducting claims. In recent years, disputes and arguments arising from insurance compensation issues have been frequently reported in newspapers. This is all because policyholders only rely on the persuasion of intermediaries when purchasing insurance and hold mysterious foreign insurance policies without understanding the details. Therefore, insurance documents are an important contract to be observed by both the policyholder and the insurance company. They are of great importance to the people's lives and property. It is only right that policyholders should fully understand the details in the documents. Furthermore, all insurance companies, whether Chinese or foreign, since they operate in China and absorb Chinese customers, and the policyholders are all Chinese, should use Chinese to respect our national identity and preserve our national essence. This is the appropriate course of action. Therefore, insurance documents and all attached regulations should uniformly abolish foreign languages and use Chinese. We request that the relevant authorities promptly issue an order for strict implementation. Based on the above reasons, we hereby jointly and formally propose that it be submitted to the General Meeting for resolution. After discussion, it was agreed that the reasons stated in the proposal are indeed valid. However, with the presence of numerous Chinese and foreign insurance companies at sea, completely abolishing foreign languages may not be practical. It is proposed to amend it to use both Chinese and foreign languages. In case of doubt, the Chinese version should prevail. We request that the competent authorities issue an order for implementation. This would be in the public interest.</p>

<p>Demanding Food, Stopping Calls for Stalls, Autumn Inventory Cannot Dismiss Employees</p>
<p>Garment workers, because of stopping calling for stalls for one hour while seeking food, the Yuan Yu store owner on Fujian Road obstructed them first, followed by Xiangfeng and Ruitai, affecting the entire road. The public was indignant and gathered at the Lianyi Society yesterday (3rd). They all said that this request was the lowest of the original labor-capital conditions and was not understood by the capital side. Moreover, the autumn inventory is approaching, and it is time to dismiss employees again. If the original conditions are not maintained in the near future, and employees are dismissed, how will they live in this era of unemployment panic? Therefore, a meeting of all Shanghai representatives was convened that evening to discuss solutions. The results of the resolution are as follows: A. Elect a five-person conditions maintenance committee to be responsible for the process. B. Petition party and government organs. C. Push representatives to submit the conditions to the clothing industry association. (1) Immediately implement the conditions agreed by both parties in 1927. (2) The shortfall of four yuan in salary and two and a half percent of interest should be paid from the first month of this year's lunar calendar. (3) The autumn inventory shall not dismiss responsible personnel participating in this movement. (4) The autumn inventory shall not dismiss employees without reason. D. Publish a declaration and ask for sympathy and assistance from all walks of life.</p>

<p>Yu Wusheng and Yu Kunxian from Shaoxing</p>
<p>Lu Keqin (also known as Ma Shaowu), a special commissioner stationed in Shanghai by the Central Party Headquarters and supervisor of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, was in charge of arresting communists. He had served in this position for more than a year and arrested numerous important members of the Communist Party, which made him a target. On the afternoon of June 14th of this year, at 7:25 PM, Lu was riding in a car to the Sweetheart brothel in Xiaohua Garden on Zhejiang Road to entertain guests. As soon as he arrived at the alley entrance, several thugs suddenly rushed out from the side and fired several shots at Lu with pistols, hitting him in vital areas. He died instantly. The murderers scattered and fled. Since the case occurred, the military and police agencies in this city have attached great importance to it and instructed their subordinates to strictly arrest the murderers and bring them to justice. At 8:00 AM the day before yesterday, Hua Detective Lang Jintang from the Laoza Zhabu Police Station received a tip and, together with detectives from the French Concession Police Station, arrested two suspects, Yu Wusheng and Yu Kunxian from Shaoxing, at 56 Pisha Road in the French Concession. They were taken back to the police station and escorted to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Judge Feng Shide interrogated them. The police station lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated that the case was still in progress and the investigation was not yet complete. Judge Feng then ordered the two defendants to be remanded in custody for further questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e162">120,000+ Yuan Heist Case, Rewards Offered for Capture of Robbers <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Information Leading to Arrest Will Be Rewarded; Return of Persons and Stolen Goods Will Result in a Percentage as Reward</p>
<p>On the morning of the 16th of last month, at 5:00 AM, a massive robbery of 129,080 yuan occurred on Yong'an Street in the French Concession. The French Concession Police Station has arrested six men and women, including robbers Zhang Weicai, Li Along (also known as Scar Along), and Wang Maomao, and sent them to court for trial. However, several major robbers, including Da Luosong (aka Jiang Gaiwen), A Bao, A Tu, A Si, etc., are still at large. The police station has obtained photos of the Jiang robber and published them in the newspaper for wanted posters, as reported previously. Now, representatives from the Wenzhou Money Industry Association, Xu Jinqing, Wang Xingshi, and Weng Laike, came to Shanghai last time and received the stolen funds. After returning to Wenzhou, they worried that the unrecovered stolen funds would be spent. Therefore, they obtained the consent of all the shops and requested the police station to offer rewards for the arrest of the robbers, hoping that the stolen goods would be recovered as soon as possible. Xu, Wang, and Weng came to Shanghai again the day before yesterday and requested the French Concession Police Station to offer rewards for the arrest of the robbers and set the rewards: (1) Da Luosong (aka Jiang Gaiwen): Reward of 1,000 yuan for information leading to his arrest. If he is caught with the stolen goods, a percentage of 10% of the recovered stolen funds will be given as a reward. (2) A Tu, A Bao, A Si, and other three robbers: Reward of 500 yuan per person for information leading to their arrest. If they are caught with the stolen goods, a percentage of 10% of the recovered stolen funds will be given as a reward, as in the previous case. The reward money has been deposited with the police station and approved by the police station. The police station has printed wanted posters and sent them to the public police stations, the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and the police agencies in other ports and inland areas for joint investigation and arrest.</p>

<p>The leader Ma Qiaosheng is called "Section Chief" by the bandits, one bandit named Wu Decheng resembles Mengyi's fellow villager</p>
<p>丨The case is adjourned to the 14th for further hearing丨</p>
<p>Shen Mengyi, son of Shen Tianxin, a Huzhou merchant in Shanghai, is currently employed in the Foreign Exchange Department of the Bank of China. His sister, Yi Yao, works at the Customs Library on Xinzha Road. On the morning of the 20th of last month, at around 8:00 AM, the siblings rode in their own car, number 2085, to go out and run errands. After dropping his sister off at the Customs Library, Mengyi was about to go to the Bank of China when he was kidnapped and taken away, with a ransom of 80,000 yuan demanded. Until 5:00 PM the day before yesterday, after Hua Chief Detective You A'gen, Detective Su Changsheng, Liu Junqing, Zhou Guisheng, and Detective Shen Jinwen from the Laoza Zhabu Police Station discovered the location of the bandit den, they went to a foreign house at 559 Lafayette Road in the French Concession and rescued the hostage Shen Mengyi. The bandits dared to resist arrest on the spot, resulting in them being shot by the detectives. Two men and one woman were injured. Further arrests were made at 45 Alber Road, 126 Zhizhong Lane on Xizilaihuo Street, 13 Gui'an Lane on Minitini Road, etc. Successively, the kidnappers Ma Rongsheng, Fang Arong, Chen Bin (special agent of the Minzhi battleship), Jiang Zhiping, Chen Yunsheng, Shu Renchang, Wu Decheng, Wen You'tang, Tao Xiaozhang, Mao Zipei, Gao Changsheng, Du Yongliang, Ma Qiaosheng, women Chen Li, Wang Zhou, Gu Juxian, Wang Bao, Dai Aju, Chen Wang, Pan Tao, and other twenty people were arrested. Three pistols and sixteen bullets were confiscated and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Special District Court's Criminal Division, where Judge Feng Shide presided over the interrogation. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yi recounted the case, stating that defendants Tao Xiaozhang, Du Yongliang, and Pan Tao were injured at the time and were being treated in the hospital and could not appear in court, but whether all the defendants were involved needed to be investigated, and requested a postponement of the trial. Then, the victim Shen Mengyi filed a case, proving the previous situation, and identified defendants Mao Zipei, Gao Changsheng, and Chen Wang in court as those who guarded him. These people guarded him during the day with two people, and two more were added at night. The injured bandits being treated in the hospital were also guards. He also pointed out that the leader was Ma Qiao, because the bandits called him "Section Chief." He had spoken with the guards and said that they were all Communists. However, the appearance of Wu Decheng was very similar to Wu Guiling and Wu Qiling from his hometown, but he could not confirm whether he was one of the two. Judge Feng checked the confessions, questioned the defendants briefly, and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further investigation in fourteen days.</p>

<p>Three clandestine labs busted in one day, two in the French Concession and one in the Chinese Concession on Dajilu Road.</p>
<p>Yang Guicheng Apprehended</p>
<p>One Yang Guicheng, from Anhui, rented four rooms on the second floor of 648 Hongfuli, Xujiahui, in western Shanghai, on April 15th of this year. At the time, he stated that the lease would be for three months. Unexpectedly, after Yang rented the house, he falsely claimed that his family was residing there, and secretly hired a large number of workers to secretly manufacture red pills. It was a leading pill factory in Shanghai, producing a large quantity every day. However, due to lack of secrecy, the French Concession Police learned of it. The Western police chief, at approximately 1:00 AM, led a team of Chinese and Western detectives to the address. However, Yang had already absconded with his family, thus evading capture. There was no one in the house. Only seven bags of poison, weighing four pounds, half a box of raw red powder, three bags of heroin, one large bag of yellow powder, five baking trays for pills, one baking box, one lead wire tray, two bamboo joints, one small scale, and thirteen white cloth bags were seized, along with one pill-making machine. All were taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Second Special District Court. After review by the judge, it was ordered that all the seized items be destroyed and that the police station issue an arrest warrant for the main suspect and severely punish him.</p>

<p>Specializing in the sale of red pills, Mr. Chen, knowing that it would be difficult to gain a foothold since the French Concession Police had strictly prohibited it, secretly dispatched his gang members to sell them secretly, and then went into hiding in private rooms. Although the police station sent detectives to search and arrest him, they had not been able to apprehend him for a long time. At 12:00 AM the day before yesterday, the police station received a tip from an informant stating that Chen was hiding in house number 12 in a certain lane on Xixinqiao Street in the French Concession. Immediately, more Chinese and Western detectives were dispatched to apprehend Chen and take him to the police station for detention pending investigation.</p>

<p>Lu Ying, captain of the Municipal Public Security Bureau's detective team, received a tip that there was a clandestine lab making red pills at number 4 Yongxing Lane, Dajilu, in the Southern City, named Five Blessings Company. The red pills were branded with the "Longevity, Wealth, and Peace" trademark. Captain Lu secretly dispatched detective Liu Shaoqing and others to the site. At approximately 6:00 PM yesterday, they, together with the chief of the Second District Police Station, went to the address for investigation. They arrested a head worker who was making the red pills, named Xie Xiaomo, age 33, from Taizhou. The old boss and the main accountant had already fled. Red pills, raw materials, and equipment were seized, including: a cabinet, six drawers, containing approximately 100,000 red pills; a water tank, containing half a tank of red pill powder; two hemp sacks of white powder, approximately 100 pounds; small hemp cloth bags, each capable of holding 1,000 to 2,000 red pills, numbering over 10,000; a wooden box, containing approximately 100 pounds of powder; a clamp for making red pills; five baskets; four bamboo baskets; an chopping board; and small hemp cloth bags containing tens of thousands of red pills. The detectives transported everything to the Second District Headquarters in cars. After a brief stop, the detectives escorted them to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>The power company praised Lu Liankui as the Eastern Holmes</p>
<p>Lu Liankui, Chinese Chief Inspector of the General Patrol Room Investigation Division, detectives Shao Jingfan, detective Zhou Honglin, and Western detectives, cracked a large-scale electricity theft case and arrested five people: Xu Quanling, Huang Youliang, Liu Zhaoji, Zhang Yulin, and Cheng Zhangcai, all employees of the power company, who colluded with major companies and silk factories to steal electricity for illicit gain. Chief Inspector Lu spent several weeks investigating before successfully cracking the case. It was handed over to the First Special District Court. The defendants jointly hired lawyers Fan Gang, Shen Xingxia, and Lin Rongqing for defense. After Judge Feng Shide opened the court for trial and debate, he announced the judgment in the Criminal Division yesterday morning. Defendant Xu Quanling was sentenced to four months of imprisonment, Liu Zhaoji was sentenced to two months of imprisonment, both suspended for two years, Huang Youliang was sentenced to eight months of imprisonment, Cheng Zhangcai was sentenced to two years of imprisonment, and Zhang Yulin was fined 200 yuan for receiving stolen goods. The seized lead prints were confiscated. Police lawyer Ru Bao Yil was standing up and requested that the defendants be remanded in custody during the appeal period, which was approved by the court. It is learned that the power company believes that this type of electricity theft case is unique, and that cracking the case was particularly difficult, so they greatly praised Chief Inspector Lu Liankui and the Chinese and Western detectives involved for their swift and proper handling, and even praised him as the "Eastern Holmes." It is said that they will formally express their respect to the General Inspection Division in the coming days.</p>

<p>Marysheng was found not guilty and released on bail</p>
<p>Regarding the disappearance case of Marysheng, agent for the Soviet Union Assistance Association Chemical Toras, the First Special Court has concluded the trial and found Marysheng not guilty and released him on bail, pending the appeal of the police station. According to Mary's lawyer, the surface of this case is purely a business relationship. The head of the Assistance Association, Mike, accused Ma of absconding with the money, but there was no strong factual evidence, so the prosecution was established. Therefore, Marysheng should be held liable, and there is no need for the police station to appeal. However, the content of this case is actually an internal political conflict. Marysheng has stated that he will permanently break away from communist Russia. Fearing that he will be harmed by his comrades in the party after he is released, the court used bail procedures to release him to show that the case is unresolved. As for the so-called political relationship, it is no different from what is rumored outside. Marysheng once served as the commander of the Soviet Russian Red Army and was originally an important figure. Also, the so-called chemical materials worth 25,000 gold yuan were purely used to beat others and were purchased by a business organization. This company also testified in court during the court hearing. My legal agency duties have now come to a complete end.</p>
<p>A meeting was summoned with the fruit trade association to discuss testing the length of time fruit can be preserved and disinfection. Fruit merchants separately hired specialists to first test the peach and apricot fruits. Once the tests have concluded, the fruit will be packed into cold-air containers and then transported to areas such as the British and South Seas Islands, with consulates in charge. All matters relating to transport and sales will be handled by the trade bureau, it is said.</p>

<p>Batons and guns are not tools for beating people, and humming songs and scolding are not suitable for duty.</p>
<p>Wen Hongen, Director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, recently discovered that police officers in various districts and teams were arbitrarily brandishing their swords, guns, and batons while on duty on the roads, and were humming songs, or using their swords, guns, and batons to beat citizens or various vehicles in violation of the law. Accidental slips could easily lead to unexpected events, which has a great relationship with discipline. Therefore, he issued a general order to all districts and teams yesterday, ordering all officers to comply. In the future, when dealing with citizens or vehicles that violate the law, they should be taken back and questioned by the officers in charge. The use of swords, guns, and batons to beat arbitrarily, or yelling and scolding, is strictly prohibited. Any actions such as brandishing swords, guns, and batons, and humming songs should also be suppressed. If anyone deliberately violates the order, once discovered and verified, they will be dismissed and investigated, and no leniency will be shown, in order to rectify discipline, it is said.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the person in charge of the Zhídōng Wheel Company told reporters that the Sheng'an Wheel did not originally have passenger berths.

<p>Valuable jewelry worth approximately 100,000 gold has been lost. The thief must possess scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>At the corner of Nanjing Road and Jiangxi Road, there is a Siberia Company specializing in selling jewelry and watches. Its location is in the center of the bustling city, and even at night, patrols frequently pass by. Unexpectedly, a burglar took advantage of Sunday night or Saturday night, and breached the back of the steel safe by drilling through the wall. Because the safe was placed against the wall, after the thief broke into the safe, they took everything inside and fled. The safe contained diamonds, gold watches, platinum watches, and other gold- and platinum-inlaid jewelry. The store is closed on Sundays. The owner, Li Pǔkēfūsījī, as a precaution, always visited the store on Sunday mornings to inspect the safe. The other day, at 11:00 a.m., Mr. Li went to the store as usual. However, when he returned at 8:00 a.m. yesterday to prepare for opening the store, he suddenly saw water around the safe and became suspicious. He quickly opened the safe and found that everything inside had disappeared, leaving only three gold and silver watches each, and one diamond-inlaid watch. He immediately reported the matter to the police station and requested detectives to investigate. As for the total amount of lost items, it has not yet been determined, because the owner did not keep a detailed record of the items stored in the safe. However, it is estimated that the value is around 100,000 yuan. It is said that they were all insured. The store is adjacent to the Japanese-owned Chiyo Photographic Equipment Store. There is a staircase in the middle leading from the sidewalk to the second floor. At the bottom of the stairs, there is a wooden door separating it from the street, which is closed with iron bars at night to prevent pedestrians from entering. The thieves used this as cover to calmly drill a hole in the wall two or three feet away from the road. First, they broke a hole of about twenty inches wide in the cement wall next to the stairs. Then, they used an acetylene torch to burn a hole about one foot long and four or five inches wide in the outer layer of the safe. Next, they used a cold chisel to split open the layer between the inner and outer layers of the safe, which was about three or four inches thick. Then, they used an acetylene torch to pierce through the inner layer. Finally, they destroyed the wooden partition inside the safe to get their hands on the valuables. The task was difficult and took a long time, but they were able to achieve their goal, which can be described as brave and cunning.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the ship would have sent an electrical signal for help long ago. Moreover, the five people on the ship had a friendship with the shipowner and the chief mate, so they ate and slept in the shipowner's cabin. If they were pirates, they would never have been allowed into the cabin. They boarded the ship on the 26th and only started the assassination on the 30th, so it was entirely a revenge killing and not a robbery. Now, the crew members have already reported the details to the Tianjin head office.</p>

<p>The Sheng'an Wheel ran aground because it mistakenly touched the Xingpǔ Reef.</p>
<p>The bottom of the ship has been breached. According to a telegram from Tianjin, workers with materials have been dispatched by the Dalian branch to repair the breach, plug the hole, drain the accumulated water, and then salvage the ship. Yesterday, we received a telegram stating that there is hope of rescuing the Sheng'an Wheel. The ship's hull is no longer in serious danger. After it is pulled out of the reef, it can be towed away for repairs. In this tragic incident, there was no loss of cargo, money, or silver on board, because the murderers were mainly focused on taking revenge and had no intention of robbing the ship.</p>

<p>According to someone from the company, the five murderers initially had no intention of harming the Chinese crew members on board. However, after the shipowner was shot, he still wanted to resist, so he blew the whistle to call for help. The superintendent, the telegraph operator, and the four helmsmen suspected that the shipowner had a special accident and rushed to the shipowner's cabin. The five murderers suspected they were coming to capture them, so they fired randomly. After the incident, the five murderers also explained to the Chinese crew members that the killings were accidental and not malicious.</p>

<p>Yáng Zhìchéng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 101 Kai'er Road in the French Concession, is 23 years old and works at the World Bank on Fourth Malu. On the morning of the 24th of last month, at 9:45 a.m., he was ordered by the bank to carry 5,000 yuan in cash to a certain place. As soon as he left the bank, the money was stolen by a thief. He immediately reported the matter to the Old Gate Police Station, requesting an investigation and offering a reward of 10% of the recovered money and the arrested thief. Now, the case has been solved by the French Concession Police's Special Organ Inspector Jīn Jiǔlín, Detective Zhāng Zǐyíng, Deputy Detective Zhōu Yàotíng, and Zhōu Bùguǎng. They learned that the thief, Lǐ Xīnhé, from Jiangbei, was hiding in Room 117 on the third floor of the Ping'an Grand Hotel at No. 14 Zhū Bǎosān Road. Yesterday afternoon, at 2:15 p.m., they brought Bao Detective Qín Yǒuyù and others to secretly arrest the thief Lǐ Xīnhé and seized 4,020 yuan of the stolen money. They brought him back to the police station for further investigation.</p>

<p>Zhū Xīngēn, the eldest son, and Zhū Liángēn, the second son, two brothers, farmers from the Zhōu family compound in Shěnjiā Dock, Fourth District, Nánhuì County, Pudong, were suddenly kidnapped by more than ten bandits at 12:00 p.m. on the 12th day of the tenth month of last year (the 3rd day of the ninth month in the lunar calendar). They were brought to Shanghai and hidden. Using the name of the Three Principles of the People Group, they sent a letter to the victim, demanding a large sum of money for their release. After Zhū contacted the bandits several times, on the 13th day of the fourth month of this year, it was agreed that 2,500 yuan would be paid to redeem the two sons. The bandits also agreed to release them. Unexpectedly, after receiving the ransom, the bandits suddenly changed their minds and only released the second son. The eldest son, Zhū Xīngēn, was still held in the bandit's den, and they demanded another 1,500 yuan for his release. Last Saturday at noon, the bandits arranged for the victim to meet at the Siming Hotel at the intersection of the French Concession's West Zilaihuo Street and Fada Road to negotiate the ransom. The matter was discovered by the French Concession Police's Special Organ Inspector Jīn Jiǔlín, who immediately led detectives to the hotel to arrest them. The bandits had already heard the news and fled. Later, they chased them to No. 616 Xizang Road in the Public Concession, where they arrested the kidnapper Yáng Língshēng. They also went to the Hongxiang Hotel on Aiwényì Road and arrested Yáng Hànchū and his son. They intercepted the hostage at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Guangxi Road and recovered a piece of clothing worn by the hostage. They brought them back to the police station for further investigation. The details have been briefly recorded in the previous report. Sūn Fèngchí, the captain of the first team of the fourth district of the Jiangsu Maritime Public Security Force stationed in Nánhuì County, learned about the case after reading the newspaper. He prepared a document and sent Patrol Officer Táng Hóngbiāo and Patrol Officer Luó Gài of the second team to Shanghai yesterday to submit the document to the Second Special District Court, requesting the transfer of the arrested criminals Yáng Língshēng and Yáng Hànchū to be interrogated in his jurisdiction. Yesterday, the police station also transferred Yáng and others to the First Criminal Court of the court. Judge Lǐ Chāngnián presided over the hearing. The police station's lawyer, Yuán Jiāhuáng, stated the case, saying that the case occurred in Pudong in the interior, and although the defendants were arrested in the Concession, the Public Security Force now has a document requesting their transfer. The police station does not object and requests the court to decide. Officer Táng Hóngbiāo submitted the official document requesting the transfer. The victims, the Zhū brothers, also recounted the details of being kidnapped and extorted. Yáng Língxíng, 42 years old, from Pudong, a carpenter residing at No. 22 Shòuxīng Lane at the intersection of Mài Tè Hèsī Tuō Road and Wǔdìng Road, stated, "They accuse me of being a kidnapper, but I don't know anything about it." Yáng Hànchū, 23 years old, stated, "Língshēng is my father, and I am also a carpenter. I have nothing else to add, and my testimony is the same as Yáng Língshēng's." After verifying the testimonies, the court ruled that since the Nánhuì County Public Security Force had sent personnel to escort them back for trial, the request should be granted. Yáng Língshēng and Yáng Hànchū were handed over to Patrol Officer Táng Hóngbiāo and others to be taken back for trial.</p>

<p>丨Dispute over Qūshā Medicine Water丨</p>
<p>Doctor Wáng Zhènchuān from Jùxiāngda Road in the French Concession and Fán Liángbó, Wú Yúnfǔ, Shěn Shàoqīng, and others jointly established a pharmaceutical company. During the six months of summer and autumn, they mainly produced epidemic prevention water, named Shī Dàoshì, which means "applying morality to the world." However, the Shī Dézhī Epidemic Prevention Water Company claimed that Shī Dàoshì and Shī Dézhī were similar in meaning, so they published an announcement stating that there were criminals using counterfeit medicine to seek money and harm lives. Wáng and others believed that this was intentionally defaming them, so they hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the local court. Yesterday morning at 10:00 a.m., Judge Sūn Xiǎolóu opened the trial. Wáng Zhènchuān testified that he was 39 years old and resided at No. 104 Dōngpūshí Road. The judge asked why you are suing Shī Dézhī. Wáng replied, "The rumors spread about the medicine we invented caused us to suffer huge losses." The judge asked, "Has it been registered with the Health Bureau?" Wáng replied, "We have requested remediation." I started with a completely charitable nature, hence the name Shī Dàoshì. It was verified by famous doctors such as Niú Huìlín, and then registered with the Health Bureau after chemical testing. Later, in order to extend the charitable life, we charged a small fee for the medicine cost. It has been five or six years. Unexpectedly, the Shī Dézhī Pharmacy became jealous of our business and openly published an announcement, accusing our medicine of being fake medicine, seeking money and harming lives, and calling the shareholders criminals. But whether this medicine is fake medicine or not, it can be tested in public. If it is related to health, I am willing to be punished and close the business. As for their claim of seeking money, we are completely doing good deeds, so how can we seek money? As for harming lives, where exactly did people die? If they cannot provide evidence, they should be severely punished and bear the responsibility for compensation." Fán Liángbó testified that he was 36 years old and said that he was with Wáng. Wú Yúnfǔ testified that he was the manager and said that we could earn six yuan for selling one box, and we needed to sell fifty boxes a day, which would be 300 yuan a day and 9,000 yuan a month. We originally planned to register a patent for 50 years, but because of the slander, there were many returns, resulting in a loss of more than 100,000 yuan. We should calculate it for ten years and demand 300,000 yuan in compensation from the defendant. The judge said that the defendant has not... The plaintiff's lawyer immediately requested legal action. The judge adjourned the hearing for further proceedings.</p>

<p>The Tóngshēngtài cigarette paper and candle store at No. 222 Middle Street in Yangjing Town, Pudong, consisting of two buildings with storefronts and a flat room behind for candle making, suddenly caught fire in the workshop at 3:30 a.m. yesterday for unknown reasons. A large amount of Asia Petroleum kerosene was stored in the room. When the oil cans were burned open by the fire, the fire was fueled by the oil and became more intense. The store staff had already escaped to the outside of the store. Seeing the situation was not good, the neighbors risked their lives to enter the store and managed to rescue some of the kerosene cans and throw them into the river to reduce the fire. Soon, the fire brigades from Yangjing and the Pudong District arrived with their pumps and worked hard to extinguish the fire, gradually putting out the flames. In this fire, two flat buildings were burned down, fortunately not spreading to neighboring stores. After the fire, the police and security team members present took the store manager, Wáng Liánchéng, to the Second Section of the Third District for strict interrogation to determine the cause of the fire and whether there was insurance for verification. As for the more than 150 cans of kerosene rescued from the fire, they were all stolen. Later, Patrol Officer Wáng found 14 cans on a Shandong boat and three cans in a certain firewood shop. Most of them are still missing. The section chief has issued an order for a strict investigation.</p>

<p>The factory in the huge tragedy of the Zhengtay Yonghe fire that killed over a hundred people rashly settled the matter with a paltry few hundred yuan. After the city-wide rubber workers organized a support association, they fought for justice. Months have passed without a resolution. It is heard that the families of the victims of the tragedy's support association telegraphed the central government to appeal. They have received a document No. 2314 from the Ministry of Industry and a reply No. 4034 from the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee. These are recorded below: (1) Telegram to the Central Government, Urgent, Ministry of Industry, Central People's Movement Guidance Committee, Nanjing: "The tragedy that occurred at the Zhengtay Rubber Factory in Shanghai is unprecedented. The number of people buried in the fire is not only 82. The factory has decisively dealt with it with 300 yuan, disregarding the law. The families of the victims have repeatedly appealed for several months, but the Party and government organs of this city have not resolved it. At this time when the people are eager for justice, we suddenly heard that the Zhengtay Factory is about to be sold. If the injustice is not redressed and the entire factory law is ineffective, then it is not only the souls of those buried in the fire and the surviving families who will suffer injustice and grievances, but also the spirit of the rule of law will be completely destroyed, which is extremely regrettable. We believe that the Ministry is the highest authority of the Party's people's movement and will not allow those who destroy the law and disrupt discipline to go unpunished, or those who suffer injustice and grievances to die in tears. Therefore, we urgently telegraph, hoping that the Ministry will quickly send senior officials to Shanghai to order the factory to provide generous compensation in accordance with the Factory Law to value human life and maintain the rule of law. We eagerly await your response.

It has been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Government for review and handling." This reply.

<h3 id="e204">Over Eight Thousand Teachers Unemployed in Romania <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>(TASS Moscow Dispatch) In Romania, 3,200 new teachers will graduate from normal universities in June of this year. However, the number of those who graduated in previous years and are currently unemployed has reached 5,300 (not including unemployed veteran teachers). Romania greatly curtailed its school system last year due to [economic] reasons, and this year it is even worse. The ruling class has regarded public education as an optional luxury. Although the Ministry of Education has dismissed a large number of old and weak teachers, it can only introduce 2,000 young teachers. Therefore, among the 8,500 unemployed teachers, 6,500 will still be unemployed. At the same time, millions of children in Romania will continue to be out of school. This decline in culture, when contrasted with Soviet Moldavia across the Dniester River, is quite interesting. In Moldavia, there were only 800 teachers and 33,700 students in 1924-25. This year, the number of teachers has increased to 2,363, and the number of students has reached 83,900. Therefore, education continues to develop in the [wild land of majority rule], and teachers are not useless scrap but necessary active members in socialist construction.</p>

In addition, there is a need to expand the experimental work. Therefore, it was decided by the bureau meeting to merge the students of the Experimental Primary School on Yongning Road into Shangwen Primary School. Starting in the 22nd year, the Municipal Sanxiu Primary School in the Lixing District of Pudong will be converted into an experimental primary school, and new buildings will be constructed at the old site of the Municipal Dezhang Primary School in Zhabei to open an experimental primary school.

<h3 id="e225">Chengzhong School Compensates Dismissed Teachers and Staff to Terminate Contracts <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>After Principal Ge resigned from the private Chengzhong School in the 20th year [of the Republic], the new principal illegally terminated the contracts of over ten teachers and staff members, including Zhu Zhongming, Xu Yunqiao, and Huang Jieru. This led to a complaint to the Bureau of Education. As a result, the Bureau of Education instructed the school's board of trustees to compensate each dismissed teacher and staff member with two months' salary to settle the matter. Subsequently, the board of trustees failed to comply with the orders of the competent authority, delaying the matter and leading to litigation in the Special District Court for a year. After three appeals, the Higher Branch Court and the Supreme Court ruled in accordance with the instructions of the Bureau of Education. Only then did the school's board of trustees comply and pay out a compensation of one thousand yuan, leaving a shortfall of over two hundred yuan. However, the teachers and staff felt reassured by the protection of the law after years of litigation, and were not insistent on recovering every penny. As a result, the lawsuit was concluded. It is reported that lawyers He Yuanxiao and Zhou Dingmei provided pro bono representation to the teachers and staff, which led to this outcome. This shows that justice is in the hearts of the people and that there is no shortage of righteous people in society.</p>

<p>Score 4-3 | Victory in the Tenth Inning | Waseda to Play Japanese Residents Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Amateur Baseball Team defeated Waseda again yesterday by a score of 4-3. The championship of the three-game series between the two teams was awarded to the Amateur Team, and they received the silver cup from Consul General Ishii.</p>

<p>Waseda's initial trial of strength was quite impressive. They scored one point in the first inning and another in the third inning. The Amateur Team's repeated attacks were unsuccessful, and they only scored one point in the fourth inning. Waseda still held the advantage.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Sudden Turnaround <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>

<p>Since the general meeting's resolution to build a large pool, the committee members have been contacting various parties to secure a suitable site, with the goal of finding a location that is centrally located and easily accessible. The construction costs are substantial, so careful consideration must be given to ensure the pool's long-term stability. Currently, Kuang Zhongmou of the Penglai Market has a close relationship with Wang Xiaolai, the association's president, and has generously agreed to allocate land on the eastern end of the Penglai Market, measuring over 300 feet long and 85 feet wide, for the association to build a swimming pool. Preliminary drawings have been completed by engineers Lu and Wu from the Bank of China, who volunteered their services. Currently, they are busy negotiating the contract. Furthermore, the Gaohang Beach Bathing Resort is now better than ever. Local gentry Zhang Yang and others have established the Beach Hotel, which is fully equipped with boating, showering, and bathing facilities. It can be said to be a sacred place for recreation and leisure on the Shanghai coast. The grand opening is scheduled for the 9th of this month. The hotel has specially reserved three rooms for members of the Chinese Swimming Research Association to change clothes and rest, showing preferential treatment. The prices for food and drinks are also more reasonable than elsewhere. The association will send people to the site to take care of everything.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Special Coverage of Jiao Tong University's Recent Developments <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Jiao Tong University has been established for 37 years. According to a detailed report on the school's operations given by President Li Zhaohuai at the 33rd graduation ceremony, the following is a selection of key points that will be of interest to those who care about the school's recent developments: 1) This school has been operating for 37 years (the Tangshan and Beiping Colleges have also been operating for 27 years). There have been many changes during this time. Five or six years ago, when the National Government promoted major construction plans and the Ministry of Railways was established, this school was reorganized. The Ministry established an Education Reorganization Committee, which engaged in discussions on both theory and practice for half a year, formulating a comprehensive plan to reorganize the school. Minister Sun approved and implemented the plan, setting a five-year and ten-year plan to improve the school. Furthermore, it was stipulated that the school's purpose was to study advanced academic subjects and cultivate talent for transportation construction. As the successor to this position, I have implemented the approved plan and, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education, have strived to reorganize the school's operations with my colleagues, adhering to the principles of raising standards and enriching content. Over the past three or four years, concrete results have gradually emerged. Engineering disciplines have a solid foundation. Scientific disciplines have not yet been fully established, because the emphasis is on applied sciences, and it is difficult to obtain satisfactory equipment and teachers. To date, there are only three departments: physics, chemistry, and mathematics, with a total of fewer than 60 students in the first, second, and third grades. Management disciplines are also still being organized, and teachers are even harder to find. To date, in addition to the original Railway Management Department, which has been revised, there are Financial Management, Public Administration, Business Management, and Industrial Management Departments. The total number of students in the college is only over 180. We firmly believe that the reason why China has been unable to cope with the endless expansion and aggression of various imperialist powers is its weakness. If we want to become rich and strong, we must not only focus on construction projects, but also study applied sciences and scientific management. Therefore, our reorganization work will take a long time, and the new foundation of this school will only be solid in three or five years. 2) This school has been ordered to plan the establishment of a textile department. When it can be established depends on the availability of funding, equipment, and teachers. Colleagues have found that the textile department cannot be limited to engineering but also has close ties to management and science, so planning has not been easy. 3) The Tangshan and Beiping Colleges also have the problem of difficulty in finding teachers. After two or three years of reorganization, the academic atmosphere is better. The Beiping College has added dormitories, which not only makes life more convenient for students but also makes teaching and management more intimate for faculty and staff. The Tangshan College has expanded its campus, which facilitates equipment. If the reconstruction plan can be implemented, it will become the most perfect science and engineering university in the north. Three years ago, a mining and metallurgy engineering department was added, and there are now only over 20 students in the first and second grades. 4) This school currently has just over 1,100 students, of which fewer than 36 are female. The number may decrease next year. The number of new students admitted this year may not be able to make up for the actual number of graduates this year. This school has always valued quality over quantity, which is known to people at home and abroad. Minister Gu recently gave instructions that colleagues can take as one of the principles for running education, that is, to cultivate the number of students in direct proportion to the needs of the country and society. This school has always adhered to the norm of "宁缺勿滥" [better to have fewer but better than to have many but bad], recruiting students with excellent academic performance. I hope that the new students admitted this year in each college will have better grades than in previous years. 5) In the past 15 years, this school has deeply felt the relationship between itself and the environment, and recognized the cause and effect of initiative and passivity. Whenever there is an opportunity, it always wants to advance both the effort of studying and lecturing. Therefore, on the 20th and 30th anniversaries of the school's establishment, exhibitions were held to promote mutual development of knowledge. Recently, on the occasion of the 37th anniversary of the school's establishment, an industrial and railway exhibition was held for 10 days. The number of visitors from all walks of life reached 300,000. Over 150 companies from various industries, roads, schools, and associations participated in the exhibition, which was a grand occasion. The school is grateful to the staff of the exhibiting companies, to the leaders of the municipal government, and to the faculty, staff, and students for their enthusiastic support. The school is even more grateful to those who donated items, which have added tens of thousands of yuan to the school's equipment. We hope to hold a larger-scale science and transportation exhibition on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of our establishment to implement public education. 6) This year, the school has received many donations from various sectors, which will be deeply engraved in our memory. In addition to the above, the Jiangnan Manufacturing Bureau donated 181 kinds of books. In addition, the Minghua Bank donated a scholarship of 1,000 yuan to support poor engineering students. The Class of 1924 also plans to donate a scholarship of 1,000 yuan, and they hope that this scholarship will increase year by year. 7) For this year's graduating students, in addition to 26 students in the graduating class in Beiping and 65 students in Tangshan, the examination has been delayed due to the military situation in the two northern colleges, and the number has not yet been determined. In Shanghai, the number of graduates from each college who have passed the examination is as follows: 17 from the Transportation Department of the Management College, 20 from the Finance Department, 7 from the Materials Department, 17 from the Railway Department of the Civil Engineering College, 15 from the Municipal Department, 28 from the Construction Department, 6 from the Industrial Department of the Mechanical Engineering College, 10 from the Railway Department, 8 from the Power Department of the Electrical Engineering College, and 16 from the Signal and Electrical Department, totaling 144. The results of 17 students are not yet complete and they will only be able to graduate after taking make-up exams or make-up courses.</p>

<h3 id="e241">Ten Thousand People Umbrella <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>In the old days, ordinary people would not use newspapers to praise the virtuous governance of their "parent officials"; they could only erect "going-away bricks" or respectfully present "ten thousand people umbrellas."</p>
<p>In the new era, there are no traces of ten thousand people umbrellas anymore; unless you see a Doutian Association or City God Association in a small town, I'm afraid many people don't know what a ten thousand people umbrella is.</p>
<p>This kind of umbrella can neither shield from the sun nor protect from the rain; it has the name of an umbrella but not the substance of one. Of course, it has been eliminated by nature and has become a historical relic.</p>
<p>However, if ten thousand people umbrellas really disappear from now on, wouldn't it be a great disappointment for virtuous and capable officials? Therefore, some clever subordinates, at the cost of considerable resources, take inspiration from elsewhere, seek from distant cities, and order the latest ten thousand people umbrella; presenting it to their superiors to elicit a smile!</p>
<p>It is said that this superior is a truly "red" minister (the word "red" has a double meaning, but there is no suspicion of communism at all), who holds several important positions (the capable are often overworked). Recently, he relinquished his other ministerial position. His subordinates, feeling his virtuous labor, took advantage of his summer retreat to Kuling to respectfully present a carriage-like ten thousand people umbrella, which can shield from the sun and protect from the wind and rain. Although it is difficult to accommodate ten thousand people under this umbrella, it can certainly accommodate the minister's wife, miss, and young master. It is said that when this large umbrella is folded up, it is only slightly larger than an ordinary umbrella!</p>
<p>Because this large umbrella is an imported product, it is estimated that it cannot be obtained for less than hundreds of gold coins; therefore, although it cannot be considered the price of the fat of ten million people, it cannot be denied that it is an expense that could reduce the suffering of ten thousand disaster victims, lightly flowing overseas. To commemorate the fact that it has affected ten thousand disaster victims, this latest ten thousand people umbrella has already become the talk of the town in Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Snow Maggots of Tibet <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Chang</p>
<p>Maggots are the larvae of flies, and they are produced in all rotten and smelly things; the hot season is the time for them to breed. Therefore, in the summer, there are the most of these creatures in dung pits and sewage, which is something that everyone knows and has seen. Unexpectedly, maggots can be produced in clean and cold things, which is truly a marvel. The following is the fact of this marvel:</p>
<p>Tibet is a high and cold land, with high mountain peaks. The peaks are covered with snow all year round, and snow maggots are produced inside the snow. The shape and color of these maggots are no different from dung maggots, except that their heads and tails are red, and they are unusually large, originally two to three feet long and eight to nine inches in girth. Because they are produced in the snow, they are called snow maggots. Snow maggots are not easy to see, because they hibernate under the snow on the top of high mountains all year round. Only when the snow on the high mountains collapses into the valleys for some reason, do the maggots in the snow fall into the valleys along with the collapsing snow, and only then can these snow maggots be appreciated by people. My friend Mr. Jian, who lived in Tibet for five or six years, only saw snow maggots once. According to the Tibetans, snow maggots are extremely cool in nature, but no one has ever studied what their specific functions are. According to ancient notes: snow maggots, also known as ice maggots or snow silkworms, are as big as fingers, come from the snow on Mount Emei in Sichuan, and are known as delicacies. Then why are the snow maggots in Tibet so big? But this was told to me by my friend Mr. Jian, who saw them with his own eyes. Mr. Jian is a kind and generous man, and he would never exaggerate, so I dare to record this matter as follows.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Yang Xingfo's Quick Remarks Before His Death <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>Yang Xingfo was shot and killed. Hearing this shocking news, no one does not feel that living in this world and being a person is not an easy matter. What was the reason for Yang's death? We have no way to speculate for him. I remember that he was an extraordinary and straightforward person. He said what he wanted to say, and when he held a pen and wrote, he was also quick and outspoken, and he was unwilling to be accommodating in the slightest. I will write down what I vaguely remember to see:</p>
<p>He scolded the Chinese people for not knowing that there is a standard for saving the country, saying, "The ideal China of students returning from the United States is to become the United States, and the ideal China of students returning from the United Kingdom is to become the United Kingdom. Even Japan, Russia, and France will become Japan-ized, Russia-ized, and France-ized. It's a pity that a China does not have seventy-two kinds of transformations, how can it not be at a loss and wander on a divergent road?"</p>
<p>In the "Preface to Women and Family" he wrote for the Gaoersong-Gaoerbai brothers, he said, "We admire and envy the social customs and marriage system of Europe and the United States, but we do not know that Europeans and Americans are deeply grieved by the abuses of their marriages and the evils of their society. They despise the antiques in their homes and welcome the dregs of their neighbors. The result is just that the change cannot be made, and they are stuck in the same place." In a letter to his classmates at Dongda discussing warlords and education, he said, "I don't know whether the so-called 'advanced' method of dealing with them is a pistol or a bomb? Even if you classmates put a knife to my neck and point a gun at my stomach, I will definitely say that Dongda and Nangao are the breeding grounds of counter-revolution."</p>
<p>Wu Peifu thought that the "red" in "communism" was the transfer of the two words "兀尢". Then the Communists are the descendants of the word "兀尢". In his article "The Inertia of Thought", he refuted it sharply, saying, "Originally, after the Xinhai Revolution, men who were neither monks nor Taoists and women who were neither male nor female had made a China of etiquette and teaching unseemly. How could it withstand another group of descendants of "兀尢" to come and make trouble?"</p>
<p>The above few quick remarks were originally made out of his feelings. Now that he is dead, even his fragmentary words and sentences feel somewhat evocative and are enough for people to chew on.</p>
<h3 id="e244">［Here Comes Jiang Taigong］ <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Hongxia</p>
<p>We often see red paper strips pasted in people’s houses that read: “Here comes Jiang Taigong, all taboos are gone.” It is said that during the New Year, or when a new house is completed, people fear that those who lack tact will say inappropriate things that could hinder one’s future, causing the burning desire for promotion and wealth to plummet below freezing point. Pasting this piece of paper allows one to be “free from all taboos.”  Humanity's ability to enjoy the flattery and auspicious wishes of others is indeed higher than that of other animals. The cry of an unknowing magpie can bring joy to people, but the caw of a crow can make people unhappy, leading them to respond with "Tui! Tui! Tui!" I don’t know which generation of extremely intelligent people passed down this idea that magpies bring good news and crows bring disaster. Therefore, general filial descendants can watch their ancestral lands be lost without lifting a finger to save them. These two sayings must be heeded.</p>
<p>Modern writers are indeed annoying. They don't say anything, but when they open their mouths, they say unlucky things, just like the caw of a crow, making people unhappy. Those who are afraid to hear writers who sound like crows can paste a red Spring Festival couplet near their ears, writing nine large characters: “Here comes Jiang Taigong, all taboos are gone,” guaranteeing freedom from all taboos.</p>

<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>The terrifying and hideous god of death, who holds the supreme authority over the lives of humans! Whether prominent and wealthy or poor and humble, no one can escape from his divine presence! Therefore, many living beings are frightened, terrified, and tremble at the sight of him.</p>
<p>But there are also many people who eagerly await his early arrival! The unemployed, the heartbroken, the desolate... the god of misfortune for these people is constantly shaking hands with the god of death. If you don't believe it, just open the newspaper and see for yourself!</p>
<p>So-and-so committed suicide due to unemployment, so-and-so jumped into the river due to heartbreak, so-and-so committed suicide by lying on the tracks due to hunger and cold... Alas! Will we really go to the Western Paradise after death? Then I would rather commit suicide! "Living is suffering, better to die and be happy." But reason tells me, be brave! Fight! Hope is leading me onto the path of fortune. But I ponder: Chinese society is so畸形(misshapen), natural disasters and human calamities are pressing tightly. The countryside is bankrupt, the number of unemployed is increasing day by day, the powerful and wealthy become more prominent every day, capitalists heavily exploit laborers. No matter how cheap the rice is, if you can't find money, you can only watch others eat fragrant white rice! In such times, shouldn't we wait for the god of death to arrive? Alas, how long can I wait? In the future, I will ask you to lead me to the Western Paradise!</p>
<p>It is wrong to think of self-destruction when one’s responsibilities are not yet finished. The path to light must be found by oneself from the darkness! The will of youth should not be too weak. If you die, how can you face your loving mother? How can you face your wife and children?</p>
<p>Alas! God of death! You truly make me laugh and cry!</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: Hearing the Warning, Her Heart Trembles, She Vaguely Wishes for Ennoblement, Watching the Performance, She Envies the Freedom to Serve the Country.</p>
<p>Gui Zhi stopped talking after hearing his explanation. Ms. Jiang didn't pay attention to this matter at all, believing that Huang Manying was just being polite and would forget about it after saying it. Therefore, she didn't say anything either. Huang Manying laughed: "Do you mother and daughter think I'm telling a lie? Why aren't you saying anything?" Ms. Jiang said, "Really? We'll have to bother you in the city." Huang Manying said, "If you mother and daughter are willing to do me the honor, I won't promise much, but I'll treat you to three days of fun, a performance of opera, and a showing of a talking picture. And a day at the market." Gui Zhi had been away from the countryside for a long time and, like city dwellers envying the scenery of the suburbs, she also wanted to go to the city and have a look. Now, with Huang Manying saying it repeatedly, she couldn't help but laugh and say: "If you're not being polite, just lend us a room where we can rest our legs. We'll spend our own money when we're there; don't treat us." Huang Manying said, "It's all easy to arrange; we'll talk about it when the time comes." After discussing for a while, they decided to go to the city for three days. Although Ms. Jiang didn't want to join in the fun too much, she didn't want to say no and spoil the girl's mood. The next day, Huang Manying repeated her invitation. Ms. Jiang saw that Gui Zhi had been complaining all this time, and now that she was finally happy, she was afraid that if they didn't go, it would make her angry again. So she packed up the things at home, asked Zhao Weng to watch the house, and took Gui Zhi with Huang Manying into the city. Although Huang Manying was a student, her family was not wealthy. Her parents and a younger brother lived in a small courtyard rented from someone else. After arriving home, she introduced the mother and daughter to her parents, who gave them a warm welcome. That evening, they bought three opera tickets and Huang Manying accompanied Gui Zhi and her mother to see the performance. Gui Zhi came for this purpose, so of course, she was very happy and went with them. This was a new and grand theater in Beiping. When they arrived at the entrance, the cars sending the audience had already jammed the road. (119)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e247">Vomit (Part 1) <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Hensheng</p>
<p>It was a one-and-a-half-story building, housing more than a dozen families. In Shanghai, this was not unusual. Almost every one-and-a-half-story building housed five or more families. Two-and-a-half-story or three-and-a-half-story buildings, on the other hand, housed fewer families, because the second landlords were generally richer and used most of the space themselves, renting out only a small portion, or not renting out at all. Living alone naturally meant avoiding the misery of crowding. Only in one-and-a-half-story buildings did second landlords aim to make money. Although there were few rooms, they could partition off the kitchen, leaving only a path barely wide enough for one person to walk through, and then rent out the kitchen space. Above the kitchen, if there was originally a roof terrace, they could build a small room, raising the roof terrace one level higher. At the same time, they could add another level on the roof, calling it the third floor, and divide it into front and rear sections to rent out to two families. And for those with existing small rooms on the roof, they could still add another level, calling it the small room on the third floor. Adding in the attic and the back of the living room, with the original front and rear sections on the upper floor, couldn't they rent out to more than a dozen families?</p>
<p>This one-and-a-half-story building was just like that. With an average of four people per household, there were more than forty people in total. In winter, everyone didn't feel anything special. But in spring, a problem gradually emerged. By summer, it became even more significant. The women didn't bear any responsibility, and only a small number of men did. However, many children should bear the responsibility. Therefore, the men or women who felt the problem was serious suffered from those who should bear the responsibility, feeling very resentful. What was most hateful was that those who should bear the responsibility, having created a significant problem, didn't feel it was significant themselves. They didn't understand that this problem would have serious consequences, endangering all the residents, even the neighbors. It wasn't that they were creating a problem that only harmed others and didn't harm themselves, like shooting someone and only killing the other person. They didn't understand this. They were even just as resentful towards Mr. Cheng in the small room on the roof, who objected most strongly, thinking that Mr. Cheng had no right to interfere with their freedom to urinate.</p>
<p>Mr. Cheng had only moved in for a few months, making him the least qualified to speak out. The longest time they had been urinating next to the water pipe was fifteen years. The shortest time was more than two years. Originally, the one who had been doing it the longest was the second landlord himself. He was the first to move into this building, and on the very first day, he had already urinated three times next to the water pipe. No one had ever said he was wrong to his face. Indeed, it had never happened. In the fifteen years, although there had been dissatisfied tenants, because he was the second landlord, even if they were dissatisfied in their hearts, they didn't dare to object to his face. In the end, they could only move out. Who knew that this Mr. Cheng, who had moved in for four months, would openly object when he was urinating? How could he not be resentful? In fact, Mr. Cheng wasn't the only one who objected. Generally, except for a small number of tenants who followed the second landlord's lead and the children, all the other tenants believed it was unhygienic. In summer, these people didn't say anything, but when they walked past the water pipe, everyone frowned, even covering their noses. Similarly, these people all felt the problem was serious in their hearts. The fear of an epidemic easily crept into their minds. The women had more opportunities to come into contact with the water pipe. That stench often made them feel nauseous. So they couldn't help but curse secretly. Coincidentally, Mrs. Cheng was the most easily nauseated by the stench. Among all the female tenants, she cursed the most vehemently.</p>
<p>That small area where the water pipe was located saw three or four adults and five or six children, including fourteen or fifteen-year-olds who were no different from adults, urinating there every day, and it had been going on for fifteen years. The stench rising in the summer was naturally enough to make people cover their noses! Mr. Cheng left early and returned late, so at most, he only smelled it four times. Mrs. Cheng had to wash rice, wash dishes, and fetch water there, and she also had to squat there for a while. That stench pierced her heart like a poisoned arrow. She couldn't stop those who urinated from urinating, so she could only transfer her anger to Mr. Cheng. When they came to rent the house, it was in February or March, so she hadn't noticed it. She didn't want this house at the time, but Mr. Cheng, for economic reasons, couldn't find a small room on the roof anywhere else, so he strongly advocated renting it. Now, this had become the reason for her transferring her anger. She said...</p>

<p>Yesterday, in the banking sector, the foreign banks on the Bund remained closed. Half of the Chinese-owned banks had resumed business as usual, but collection, settlement, and trading activities were very sluggish. The market rate for foreign interbank lending remained at 4%. Clearing of bills in the morning session totaled over 4.5 million yuan, with new transactions totaling over 1.3 million yuan.

<p>The interest rates for deposits in the previous month (June) show a slight improvement for day loans, exceeding the fixed amount of 2 yuan. However, the decision made at the regular meeting yesterday was to keep the old rates, calculated at 2 yuan and 95扣. Accrued interest will be added based on 4 taels and 5 qian. In this case, the highest accrued interest will be in the range of 10 yuan and 45 jiao.</p>

<p>According to a report from the National News Agency in London on the 3rd, the price of large bars, both near and far, is 625. The recent rate is 18 pence and 5625, and the forward rate is 18 pence and 6875. The exchange rate between the British pound and the US dollar opens at 4 yuan, 4 jiao, and 6.5 fen.</p>
<h3 id="e252">Securities Rise Sharply, Retreat Quickly, 96 Plummets More Than Two Yuan <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>Other bonds fall slightly by 2-3 jiao to 5-6 jiao.</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the market price of 96 suddenly rebounded and violently. The bulls were rushing to take profits in a disorganized manner. The quick rise and quick fall were within the reporter's expectations. In reality, the air remained the same, and the environment had not changed. A rise without reason must be followed by a fall without reason. However, this particular government bond has been actively traded for many days, and the number of accounts with open positions is already quite substantial. After the floating long positions are taken, there is still hope for a further increase. Speculators will take advantage of this to go long or short, depending on the opportunity. Ordinary retail investors who follow the trend will inevitably experience both joy and sorrow. The reporter warned against the rebound long ago. When the market opened yesterday morning, there were more sellers than buyers among the various syndicates, and the market price fell slightly by about 0.3 jiao. However, the bull positions in 96 had already begun to shake, falling by 0.5 yuan. In the second session, the supply still exceeded the demand, continuing to fall by a small amount of 0.2-0.3 jiao. The price of 96 still did not recover, falling by 0.4 jiao. When the afternoon session opened, the bond market was still sluggish, falling by another 0.1-0.4 jiao. The salt tax rose slightly by 0.05 yuan. However, the price of 96 fell by another 0.7-0.8 jiao due to the exodus of major bull positions, and there was no sign of recovery until the market closed, with the decline still severe. The lowest price for this month was 8 yuan and 6 jiao. The prices of other bonds recovered slightly by about 0.1 jiao. The forward salt tax still showed no improvement. In summary, the price of 96 fell in four consecutive sessions, a sharp drop of more than 2 yuan compared to the previous day. This can also disprove the absurdity of the "consolidation theory." Since this particular government bond has been active, speculators have enjoyed it. It is unlikely to decline in a straight line. Other bond markets also fell slightly by 0.2-0.3 jiao to 0.5-0.6 jiao. The total turnover was 11,014,000 yuan, including 4,000 yuan in spot transactions. Futures transactions were dominated by 96, accounting for 3.6 million yuan. The total salt tax was only 2.65 million yuan. Disarmament bonds accounted for 780,000 yuan. The 19 Customs Bonds accounted for 785,000 yuan. The 20 Customs Bonds accounted for 1.52 million yuan. The remainder ranged from tens of thousands to hundreds of thousands.</p>

<p>According to a report from the Xin Feng Trading Company, the New York stock market on Saturday (the 1st) rose sharply due to the weak US dollar and the influx of positive commercial progress reports. Trading was also very active. Railroad stocks rose the most. Central New Jersey Air Transport Railroad rose 16.5 yuan to a new high of 105 yuan. Turnover in the half-day reached 2,791,000 shares. Unless there are unexpected events during the day, it is expected that the market will continue to advance. Steel stocks will reflect the increase in steel production this week and reach new highs. According to a telegram from the New York financial consulting organization contracted by this company, the organization believes that the gold dollar has a high probability of devaluation. If the initial devaluation of the gold dollar is 30%, then all countries in the world will expand their currencies in unison, and stocks and commodities will rise sharply. Wheat rose due to mass buying. American cotton rose due to the agreement of various yarn factories to work 40 hours per week and strong stock support. Future market conditions will depend on the government's announced progress in reducing cotton fields. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market saw a slight rebound after a sharp rise, and some factories were selling off their stock. However, the situation for foreign cotton remained good, so Ruida continued to buy in large quantities. As for the factories stopping night work, it remains to be decided at the industry conference scheduled for July 7th. In the afternoon, it was heard that British factories were offering a large quantity of cotton yarn for sale in the bidding yarn market, and market sentiment softened.</p>

<p>The pre-market opening for bidding saw firm sentiment due to news of factory shutdowns, with near-month contracts rising by 0.8-1 yuan and far-month contracts remaining unchanged. As the bidding progressed, market sentiment turned downward, and prices for all months fell by 0.7-1.1 yuan. The afternoon session opened with a harder market, but prices fell again after two or three rounds of bidding, with all months falling by 0.1-0.3 yuan. Total trading volume for the day was 73,500 bales. The sellers included Tongfu (2,350 bales), Dafeng (2,400 bales), Zhenda (1,650 bales), Gengfeng (2,150 bales), Changfeng (2,050 bales), and Tonghe (2,000 bales).

<p>Spot yarn sales remain good. Total purchases from various ports for the day were 915 bales. Market conditions were similar to the previous day. It is rumored that Yihua Factory is offering 3,000 bales of 20-count Wufu/Shepherd yarn at 199 yuan, clearing out commissions and fees for the July-September period. Purchases by various syndicates are as follows:</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending weaker, and retail investors are leaning towards short selling. However, the overseas cotton industry remains good, so some are buying new cotton for far-month delivery. Japanese merchants are buying 2,000 dan of Huoji cotton for November-December delivery at higher prices. Currently, most shorts are expecting US cotton to arrive in Shanghai soon, and factories are shutting down, so many are bearish and shorting.</p>

Although exporters and brokers were all buying, market sentiment believed that overseas market conditions might soften. Japanese boycotts of Indian cotton have caused some obstruction here. At the same time, a large batch of Bai Luo Creek cotton was delivered, and market prices were also affected. In terms of spot goods, both European and Japanese shipping companies have inquiries. Inquiries from local factories have also been slightly wider than before due to a slight improvement in the demand for cotton textiles.

<h3 id="e260">Rumors Abound in the Grain Market, Flour Prices Plummet by 0.4-0.5 Yuan <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market saw prices initially flat, then decline significantly after the market opened. As the quoted price for foreign wheat, US wheat had rebounded by 1 yuan, market sentiment was stable at the initial opening. Later, as spot flour sales were sluggish and demand was extremely low, the northern brokers had been depressed for a long time, and the Nanyang brokers rarely inquired. Therefore, major factories were actively selling at each round of bidding. Weak market sentiment was greatly impacted. Near and far futures fell sharply. In the afternoon session, market conditions for all months continued to plummet. It was rumored that the United Kingdom had another loan of 5 million pounds, mostly related to flour and wheat. As rumors became prevalent, market sentiment declined again. The volume offered by major factories was also very large. As a result, prices for all months were unstable. If flour sales do not improve and factory inventories increase, the near-term futures may present a new lowest record. As a result, the price for the current month plummeted by 0.525 yuan compared to the previous week, August futures fell by 0.475 yuan, September futures fell by 0.4 yuan, October futures fell by 0.375 yuan, November futures fell by 0.4 yuan, and December futures fell by 0.375 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Wheat Futures Plunge, July Futures Plunge by a Huge 0.11 Yuan <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, wheat futures opened flat, then declined in all months after the market opened. The initial opening saw prices unmoved due to a quoted price of 1 yuan for foreign wheat. Later, as the flour market declined, market sentiment followed suit. Also, as spot wheat inventories were already abundant, market sentiment was naturally weaker, with declines of 0.03-0.05 yuan compared to the opening round of trading. In the afternoon session, market sentiment was like a storm sweeping through leaves, with prices falling sharply across the board. The weakness reached its extreme due to the sluggishness of the flour market and the decline in spot wheat prices. Major bull positions had no choice but to close out positions. As a result, the rate of decline became more violent. As a result, July futures fell by a huge 0.11 yuan compared to the previous week, August-October futures fell by 0.08 yuan, and November futures fell by 0.09 yuan. Spot wheat prices saw factories mostly adopting a policy of selecting higher-quality wheat while selling off lower-quality wheat. Also, as current deliveries had reached more than 100,000 bales, factories were unwilling to stock up further. The overall market saw ship wheat being delivered, but no transactions of wagon wheat. The asking prices were lowered by 0.1-0.2 yuan. Wheat from Kaihua Bridge, An亭(Anting), Tongzhou, Wangxian Bridge, and Baihe Port was priced at 3.6 yuan, and high-quality Kunshan wheat was priced at 3.7-3.65-3.58 yuan. Wheat from Zhitang and Zhitang was priced at 3.63 yuan. Shuangdu wheat was priced at 3.6 yuan, and the lower quality was at 3.55 yuan. Taicang wheat was priced at 3.55 yuan, and the lower quality was at 3.4 yuan. Penglai wheat was priced at 3.5 yuan, and the lower quality was at 3.4 yuan. Minhang wheat was priced at 3.38 yuan. Suzhou wheat was priced at 3.68 yuan. Wuxi wheat was priced at 3.58 yuan. Dongbang wheat was priced at 3.5 yuan. Tangshi wheat was priced at 3.65-3.67 yuan. A total of more than 14,000 bales were offered, with 8,000 bales going to Yifeng, 2,400 bales going to Fuxin, and 3,700 bales going to Huafeng.</p>

<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the sources of supply for 50 number, 零星(scattered) and both stomach are relaxed, visiting guest are very few, situation is a apathetic one. The market situation is flagging, indeed having a apathetic one appearance. Therefore, the market prices of 常幫(regular)蘇同幫(Sudong)幫(gang)南港(South Harbor) etc. japonica and 杜尖(Dujian) as collected in this street have been revised downward slightly. Only 洋尖(foreign tips) is able to stand firm because of the lack of goods. 客幫(guest gang)威海衛幫(Weihaiwei) and 採辦靑角幫(procurement green corner gang) procurement of 青角薄稻二成、烟台幫辦松江貨二成, a total of five to six hundred bales. Therefore, the market outlook for 帮(gang)薄稻 is also soft by seven to eight fen. Overall, the above situation still has a downward trend, 元(Yuan) still have no glory or disgrace.</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, there were twenty-three or four ships from 河下 and other routes. The sales of white rice were thin, and the market sentiment was weak by a small amount. The early sale of thin japonica rice saw few arrivals and flat sales, with prices trending towards stability. The 埠客尖(Port 客尖) also see the general situation. Foreign 尖(tips) arrival have some, sale stomach are good. 杜尖(Dujian) arrival are rare, sale are dull, call down several points. 元(Yuan) also saw a weak trend.</p>

<p>丨Hunan Jiangxi Rice Fall Small Two Jiao丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of Fujian Zhejiang 客 (Ke) rejuvenated. The Fujianese gangs, which have long lacked畅办(free management), suddenly changed their purchases due to the high prices of 杜尖(Dujian), instead purchasing Xianggan 客秈(Ke Xian). More than 3,000 bags were sold to the market. Sales of 온대帮(temperate zone gang) in Zhejiang province were also fragrant, but they focused on Nanjing Jiangbei 無錫(Wuxi) and other 客秈(Ke Xian). The total number of bags sold to the market was about 4,000. After several days of sluggishness, the market situation immediately became lively after the Fujian Zhejiang 畅办(free management). As for the market conditions, the Jiangbei Nanjing and other 秈(Xian) are standing firm, while the Xianggan rice has fallen by two jiao. Because the Xianggan rice has been in storage for a long time, the quality is old and inferior. The owners, fearing that the hot weather would not allow them to store the rice for long, were willing to lower the price for sale. As Fujian and Zhejiang already have inquiries, they lowered the price to accomodate the market. The Nanjing Jiangbei rice is sold as soon as it arrives and is of high quality, so it is sold at a good price. However, the inventories of high-quality Xianggan rice are exhausted, and the prices are still high. Yesterday, the old開機晚機油were the lowest-grade goods at 7 yuan 5-6 jiao. Wuhu 麻秈(flax rice) was priced at 7 yuan 5 jiao, Beijing crude was priced at 6 yuan 6 jiao, and another 800 bags of small絞(small twist) were priced at 7 yuan 5 jiao 5 jiao, which were also sold to 温台(temperature terrace).</p>

<p>Early Silkworms in Hangzhou Area Will Soon Be Spinning Cocoons</p>
<p>In the Linping area of Hangzhou, farmers are starting to raise summer silkworms this year because they profited from the spring silkworm season. After the silkworm eggs hatched, the weather was mild, and the silkworms developed smoothly. The early batches have already begun spinning cocoons, and the later batches are in the late stage of molting and consuming leaves vigorously. A bumper harvest is anticipated.</p>
<p>Early Batch of Silkworms in Yixing Just Hatched</p>
<p>Silkworm farmers in the four rural districts of Yixing are raising summer silkworms because they saw that the mulberry trees still had plenty of leaves. Most of the silkworms being raised are of foreign breeds, and the number of eggs hatched is not small. The sunny and warm weather has been favorable for hatching. The early batches have just hatched and are about to be fed with tender leaves.</p>

<p>Italian silk expert Dr. Marie, accompanied by a specialist from the Ministry of Industry, went to Wuxi the other day and visited the Provincial Silk Testing Ground to inspect the results of this year's experimental breeding of European silkworms in unwinding cocoons and reeling silk, in order to study the quality of the silkworm breeds. However, the testing ground is currently in the reeling stage and has not yet obtained accurate reports, so Dr. Marie took the train back to Wuxi that evening.</p>

However, since the Russian Aid Association started operating Qimen Jiang tea, the market has been relatively stable. According to observations by general tea merchants, it is not difficult to clear the existing stock.</p>

<p>The sale of Orchid rice in the north is slow, and there is still a lot of old stock, so the market has been sluggish for a long time. The first batch of new goods was said to have arrived yesterday, transported by the Taikoo Company's Taiyuan, totaling more than 130 cases. Given the current sluggish sales, it is difficult to expect all of them to be sold quickly. However, according to the consignor's telegram, this batch of goods is a beautiful yellow color and can be considered superior. Later goods have been affected by rain, and the color is not as beautiful. Therefore, the consignor plans to temporarily hold back.</p>

<p>A Delicious Dish for Summer: Pickled Green Bamboo Shoots from Li Xuan</p>
<p>Green bamboo shoots are the shoots of a small bamboo species. They are thin, short, fresh green, and tender. They are boiled in salt water and then dried to become pickled green bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>Green bamboo shoots are the most common and delicious dish in summer. "Tea with rice, pickled green bamboo shoots" is generally liked by people. Because of their cheap price, usually one or two hundred yuan can buy one or two liang of this package, enough to cook a dish or make a bowl of soup (naturally, it needs to be matched with other dishes). Therefore, it can be widely sold, and because of its pure and clean texture, it is even more welcomed by vegetarians and people who pay attention to hygiene.</p>
<p>The production area of green bamboo shoots is in the Tianmu Mountain range in Zhejiang Province. Among the counties along the mountain, Lin'an and Xiaofeng produce the most and the quality is higher. Other counties such as Yuqian, Changhua, and Ningguo in Anhui Province also produce a lot. The products from various places are mostly concentrated in Yuhang, and then distributed to other places for sale by the mountain goods companies in Yuhang.</p>
<p>Green bamboo shoots begin to be harvested and produced after the Beginning of Summer. Near the Grain Full, they can be on the market. The bamboo shoots, after being steamed, boiled, and dried, become dried bamboo shoots, which are often only one-tenth of the weight of the fresh bamboo shoots; that is, every 100 jin of fresh bamboo shoots can only produce about 10 jin of dried bamboo shoots. The dried bamboo shoots are divided into many different names according to the quality of the goods, in order to show the difference. The common ones are early round, fat plump, bald plump, pointed plump, medium plump, and small plump. Early round and fat plump are high-quality goods, with dry and tender strips. "Making" is exquisite, and there is no "old head". Bald plump and pointed plump are ordinary goods with thinner strips and uneven sizes. Medium plump and small plump are lower-quality goods with thin and small strips and many "old heads". As for general identification, you should choose those with bright green color (if the color is too bright, it may be old goods from the previous year), fat and tender strips, flat volume (that is, so-called good craftsmanship), and small head (otherwise it will be older). The common saying that green bamboo shoots are flat-tipped bamboo shoots has indeed grasped the good points of green bamboo shoots.</p>
<p>The unit of buying and selling green bamboo shoots is "set" in stores and among experts. Each set is packed with 28 small baskets, wrapped in bamboo shoots to form a cylindrical shape. Each small basket weighs about two jin and four liang to six liang, including the skin. The baskets are also made of bamboo pieces and lined with bamboo bark, tightly sealed for long-term storage. When sold in stores, they are mostly sold by the jin. Ordinary people certainly never buy the original set, and few buy the original basket.</p>
<p>In addition, green bamboo shoots have a by-product, which is bamboo shoot skin. There are two kinds of bamboo shoot skin: raw Du clothing, which is rented for cooking.</p>
<p>Baked Taiwan clothing also tastes excellent, but it is more expensive and not very popular.</p>

<h3 id="e275">Thoughts on Reading the National Periodical Catalog <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>One day, there was an advertisement in the Shenbao for Modern Bookstore selling national periodicals. I counted the catalog, and there were a total of 200 kinds. In my opinion, this catalog is quite complete, and almost all of the more famous periodicals are in it.</p>
<p>When I usually go to Neishan Bookstore, I am often amazed by the abundance of Japanese periodicals. Reading this catalog now seems to give me great comfort. The New Culture Movement of the past 13 or 14 years has actually produced 200 kinds of periodicals. Who can say that the May Fourth Movement had no achievements?</p>
<p>Some people say that there is no freedom of speech in China, but are these 200 kinds of periodicals not a "clear proof" of freedom of speech?</p>
<p>There used to be a statistic that said that there were more than 240 kinds of periodicals published by Japan in the three northeastern provinces (China only had more than 40 kinds). This number is just the number of periodicals in the whole country now. Naturally, we don't need to feel ashamed of this. Imperialism has economically invaded us for 80 years, but we still have a few yarn and silk factories. Comparing this, we can feel calm and at peace.</p>
<p>I have not run a bookstore, so I don't know how the sales of these periodicals are. Chinese booksellers often keep this business a secret, and it is actually impossible to count. Fortunately, there is already a catalog of 200 kinds. Our ancient civilized country is already quite proud.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot say that these are all cultures under the command knife, but one thing can be asserted, that is, the command knife is always waving in front of you. A fool who is unwilling to be protected will have your freedom canceled sooner or later.</p>
<p>Therefore, humor is the smartest method. You can find a lot of humor in here. This makes us feel infinite sympathy, but it also shows the suffering that the era has given to writers!</p>
<p>Holding this catalog, I couldn't help but feel lost for a long time.</p>

<p>Students A, B, C, D.</p>
<p>Teacher: I am the teacher here. It is true that my two shoulders cannot carry burdens, and my hands cannot lift baskets. I rely on a thin mouth to make a living and eat. There are not many students in the school, but they are all cunning and strange. They usually don't take me seriously and only make trouble. It is really difficult to deal with them. I need to think of a good way to rectify this academic atmosphere. Let me think, let me think. I've got it, I've got it. Let me come up with some difficult problems and ask them to solve them. If they can solve them, then that's fine. If they can't, I'll take the opportunity to severely reprimand them to avenge the troubles they've caused me. Fortunately, now the graduation examination is in full swing. I'm not afraid that these young boys will not obey. This is really a good plan, a good plan. So how should I come up with the difficult problems? I've got it, I've got it. Let me call them out and test them. Ahem, ahem, are the students all here?</p>
<p>Students A, B, C, D: We're all here.</p>

<p>Tomorrow, we'll take the graduation examination, so we can be prepared.</p>
<p>Students: Then please give us the problem, teacher. Please make it as easy as possible.</p>
<p>Teacher: Of course. I'll draw a dog on the blackboard first. Okay, it's done.</p>
<p>Students: No, no, teacher, you drew it wrong, you drew it wrong. Tsk! Tsk!</p>
<p>Teacher: What's wrong? What's wrong?</p>
<p>Students: Teacher's dog is missing a tail. Rabbits don't have tails, but dogs have tails.</p>
<p>Teacher: Then, you fill it in. That's the problem. Each person is only allowed to fill it in once, and you all have to be blindfolded. Those who fill it in correctly will get 100 points.</p>
<p>Student A: Good, good. This test is so easy. Let me go first.</p>
<p>Teacher: Let you go first. Blindfold yourself. Okay, fill it in.</p>
<p>Student A: It's done.</p>
<p>Students B, C, D: Ha, no, no, he filled in the dog's tail on the dog's back. Get down, get down.</p>
<p>Student B: He didn't fill it in well. Let me do it now. I will definitely fill it in correctly.</p>
<p>Teacher: Let you do it. Blindfold yourself, fill it in.</p>
<p>Student B: Okay, it's filled in.</p>
<p>Students C, D: No, no, he put the dog's tail on the dog's head. What a joke, what a joke. Let us do it, let us do it.</p>
<p>Teacher: Blindfold yourself. Okay.</p>
<p>Student C: It's done.</p>
<p>Students A, B: No, no. He's even worse than us. He put the dog's tail in the dog's mouth. No, no.</p>
<p>Student D: Let me do it, let me do it. If you can't do such an easy thing, what's the matter? I will definitely be better than all of them. I will definitely be first.</p>
<p>Teacher: Wait a minute, blindfold yourself. Ahem, fill it in.</p>
<p>Student D: It's done. Is it right?</p>
<p>Students A, B, C: Tsk, tsk, he's even further off. His tail is simply separated from the dog's body. Idiot, idiot.</p>
<p>Student A: Then, I filled it in the closest. I should be first.</p>
<p>Student B: I should be second.</p>
<p>Student C: Although I put the tail in the dog's mouth, it's still on the dog's body. I'm third.</p>
<p>Student D: Although I put the tail on the dog's body, there is still a tail, but I'm stronger than the teacher. The teacher didn't even draw the tail.</p>
<p>Students A, B, C: Then, the teacher is too bad. Let's drive the teacher away, let's drive the teacher away.</p>
<p>Teacher: Hey, this is a difficult problem. I specially gave it to you to fill in.</p>
<p>Students: What difficult problem? It's clear that you didn't draw it well yourself, and you forgot to draw the tail. Drive him away, drive him away. Drive him away, drive him away!</p>

<p>[China can fight. It needs China to abandon the ports on the coastline, lure the enemy to land warfare, and use the power of Chinese soldiers and civilians to avoid direct wars, conduct attacks and irregular struggles, which can definitely be done, but considerable sacrifices are inevitable. The government should move to Sichuan. Holding on to it in the Central Plains, if we can persevere for more than a year and a half, even without the intervention of other countries, Japan will have no strength.] (Spring in the North, page 108)</p>
<p>According to the author, this person is someone who [works hard to exert his strength and implements things step by step]. Compared with the method of moving the capital to Luoyang, his plan can be said to be more thorough and more practical. No matter how much strength the Japanese have, they will not be able to [take Chengdu] for at least a year and a half, which is a fact that everyone will believe. I don't know why this military officer did not offer this proposal to the authorities at that time, so that the non-resistance doctrine and the three-capital doctrine could not be the sole precedent.</p>
<p>(II)</p>
<p>The triangular love novelist Zhang Ziping recently published his essay [Old Woman in Jiangbei] in a certain newspaper, writing about the death of an old woman who washed clothes. He felt three changes in his emotions after hearing the news of the death of the old woman in Jiangbei.</p>
<p>First, he heard about the old woman's lifelong asceticism and her death from postpartum disease. He [couldn't help but feel very sympathetic] and complained a lot, taking up the cause of the poor.</p>
<p>Second, the tone of the writing changed, and he remembered that this old woman had [instigated their long-used eldest sister to leave] and [instigated the female servant they had then hired] to leave, so he felt that [that old woman was too hateful] and [not worthy of death,] and [almost all of his sympathy and sighing disappeared].</p>
<p>Third, the tone of the writing changed again, and he regretted his [base and cruel feelings], greatly rebuked himself, and said: [What cruel animals humans are,] and [forgave] her behavior that was unfavorable to him during her lifetime.</p>
<p>Some people advocate petty-bourgeois revolutionary literature. I think this article is the most typical, and it is also a new formula for the author's later works, which was produced following the formula of his early love novels. Therefore, I specially recorded it.</p>

<p>— Dan Guo Sun</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>In a flat-roofed house, there were six or seven men and women, each supporting their bodies in different ways, sitting, standing, and lying on the opium couch, talking leisurely. What were they talking about? They were talking about the current news of the fighting in Zhabei, and to be more precise, they were talking about the legendary news of the fighting in Zhabei. The posture of one person talking was as if he was sketching how a horse unexpectedly won the champagne at the racetrack. The posture of another person talking was as if he was describing how a small boat miraculously escaped a hurricane outside the Wusong Estuary. As for the others, they seemed to be expressing that their ears were not empty, so they just waited for someone to talk and immediately added to it. Some seemed to be expressing that their concern for the current situation and for national affairs was not indifferent, so they showed various expressions while listening. However, the light of the electric light in the house could prove that the emotions of these people were not as tense and active as the sound of gunfire they were hearing!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the middle-aged man lying on the opium couch, after taking a puff of opium, stretched out his flat and hoarse voice, as if sighing and exhaling:</p>
<p>[The sound of cannons seems to have started earlier tonight... It's probably not even nine o'clock yet... The rumbling sound is especially frightening, maybe no one is walking on the street without a curfew...]</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he sighed again, and the air in the house seemed to suddenly become quiet again. No one had the interest to utter a word. After a few seconds of silence, the middle-aged man changed his tone and asked:</p>
<p>[Do you know Shou Zichun, Bo Tang?]</p>
<p>[I know him, Dad.] A young man sitting next to the table quickly turned around and replied to him sincerely: Then he showed a puzzled expression and asked: [Is Dad talking about Shou Zichun who used to be a counselor in the Ministry of the Navy?]</p>
<p>[I don't know about that; but I know he is now working at... Kenye Bank as... something...]</p>
<p>[That's right, Dad; he's from Fujian, right?]</p>
<p>[That's right, a Fujianese. He asked me to have dinner with him in the next day or two... He mentioned you to me today.]</p>
<p>[I haven't seen him for two months... Did Dad just meet him recently?]</p>
<p>[It's been about two or three months... before the war... I met him several weeks ago. He's a good person, always with that smiling round face, red and interesting, and his body is also interestingly short...]</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, he aimed his opium pipe at the opium lamp to smoke the newly prepared opium. Bo Tang did not understand why his father, Yao Yongsun, would know Shou Zichun, because the paths of these two people were too far apart. However, because Yongsun's life had too many mysterious stories, Bo Tang did not feel any curiosity at this time to inquire carefully, so he turned back to chat with the other people. However, Yongsun smoked opium and burned opium while secretly reviewing how he and Zichun had met in the first place.</p>
<p>Yongsun was originally the son of a high-ranking official of two generations in the late Qing Dynasty. Needless to say, his youth was a life of a young master; when his adulthood arrived, the Qing Dynasty had just been overthrown. Since he could not enjoy the life of being born into privilege and wealth, he simply continued to live in Shanghai to taste the taste of debauchery. Therefore, his adult life was also like that of a young master. After mixing like this for more than ten years, he was already a man approaching fifty years old, but his life had not changed from beginning to end. He did not become a politician, let alone a bureaucrat, nor did he become an entrepreneur. He only changed fresh methods every year to enjoy the ever-changing debauchery in Shanghai, and constantly spent thousands and thousands of foreign money from his family on the Bund. Therefore, his middle-aged life was still like that of a young master. Presumably, those men and women in Shanghai who parasitized in public places, as long as they saw the black car with the two license plates numbered one hundred and eleven approaching their door, everyone knew that it was the arrival of Yao Third Young Master - the name "Yao Third Young Master" had not changed for more than thirty years in various public places in Shanghai! On a certain winter night in 1930, this double-numbered 111 black car took Yongsun into the gate of 281 Foch Road. Once Yongsun entered this magical place, which should occupy a section of the [Shanghai Little History], he was habitually led to the hall on the south side of the upstairs. Immediately, two waiters in white shirts and black pants ran up to him to take his hat and coat. Subsequently, he raised his head, which consisted of three things: the eyebrows of a beautiful woman, the nose of a Jew, and the forehead of a god of longevity, and leisurely walked to the long table surrounded by many men and women. From the seats that the men and women had left empty for him, he grabbed one at random and sat down.</p>

<h3 id="e279">Youthful Desires <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Jian Yin</p>
<p>Desire is something everyone possesses. Because of desire, people disregard their possessions and lives, employing all possible means to attain it, striving to realize the object of their desire immediately. However, humans are insatiable creatures, so desire is limitless. Therefore, human struggles gradually become unavoidable. The more desires one has, the fiercer the competition. This is a very obvious direct proportion, especially for young people in general. They have the springtime of their lives; they need a beautiful environment and a comfortable life, so they also plunge into the crowd to pursue their desires.</p>
<p>Desire is certainly needed by everyone, but excessive enjoyment and undue demands are undoubtedly harmful to people's futures.</p>
<p>Young people are the pillars of the country's future and the pride of today's society. However, placed in this dazzling and complex environment, on the journey of pursuing their desires, if they stray onto a despicable path, it will bury a lifetime of happiness. How terrible is that! Therefore, regarding all desires, we must recognize which are proper and which are improper. Now, let us discuss them separately as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding proper desires, they can be roughly divided into two types:</p>
<p>(1) The evolution of intellectual society follows the wheels of culture. We rely solely on the limited knowledge gained from school to keep up with the rapidly advancing culture, which is clearly like sighing at the vast ocean. Therefore, in addition to the rigid knowledge of school, we must closely examine and experiment with society in practice to make up for the deficiency of our own intellectual famine. Therefore, enlightened young people also feel that to avoid being left behind by society, the only way is to constantly seek knowledge. We believe that this phenomenon, this desire for knowledge, is very admirable.</p>
<p>(2) After vocational youth leave the school of happiness, the first thing they feel is most needed and most urgent is the issue of occupation. However, in this era of declining production and societal upheaval, finding a suitable position is very difficult. But on the other hand, the lack of talent is felt everywhere, and finding talent is truly not easy. The creation of this contradictory phenomenon is actually due to the fact that those seeking employment fundamentally lack genuine basic knowledge. Naturally, in modern society, apart from a few who have the connections to stand on a group of planting party and private interests, the necessary condition is still that young people themselves must first have genuine knowledge. Therefore, if we want to seek a noble profession, we must first possess genuine knowledge. The meaning of life's happiness is the reward of hard work. Therefore, occupation is needed by everyone and is also a desire that young people should have.</p>
<p>Regarding improper desires, there are three types:</p>
<p>(1) Marriage Marriage is considered by young people to be the most important and sweetest thing in life, so they do not hesitate to abandon their studies in order to find their individual partner. Although marriage is an important matter, I believe it can only damage the will of young people. I am not opposed to marriage, but it is not suitable for young people. I believe that young students who are studying should focus on their studies. Otherwise, they will lose sight of one thing while attending to another, and the result will only be increased trouble. Therefore, our conclusion is that marriage is important to young people, but it should be avoided during the study period, so I cannot consider it proper.</p>
<p>(2) Vanity The word "vanity" does not know how many young people it has harmed. Because they are influenced by vanity, they throw proper learning to the back of their minds, follow the trend, and everyone only cares about external beauty, sacrificing a lot of money and time, but without any hesitation. In addition to seeking external beauty, they are no longer willing to ask or hear about other things. Those who seek knowledge are merely doing so in name only, and they are satisfied when they get a diploma. This morbid state will cause several tragedies for young people and bury many crises in society. It is the leader of sin for both oneself and others. Therefore, vanity is an improper desire, and we should eradicate these ideas.</p>
<p>(3) Extravagance People's concept of loving beauty is born of nature. Therefore, people's love of beauty and cleanliness is also inevitable. However, excessive pursuit of beauty leads to the path of extravagance, which is also a common disease of modern youth. Because they are accustomed to extravagance, they regard money as dirt, spending hundreds of dollars at a time, as if it were mud and sand. This poison, if minor, harms the individual's family, even to the point of bankruptcy and ruin. If major, it poisons society, the country, and even leads to the decline of the country's lifeline. Therefore, a luxurious life can make young people's will depressed, and the desire for extravagance can lead to the degradation of young people's personality.</p>
<p>If they are unrestrained and indulge in wine, sex, and lust all day long, they will inevitably injure their bodies without realizing it. As a result, they will become exhausted, their spirits withered, and their brains depleted, abandoning their studies, and eventually they will be unable to recover, regretting it for life. This kind of young person is originally</p>
<p>Seeking their own death, which need not be said by me.</p>

<p>— Yi</p>
<p>Dense dark clouds covered everything on earth. Lightning flashed constantly, and thunder rumbled. People cooling off in front of the steps, afraid of the downpour, rushed like bees into the dark and lightless Japanese house. The heat of the street, washed by the rain god, was all driven into the houses. The heat inside the house increased sharply, causing annoyance, like ants on a hot pot, unable to sit or stand still. The dark clouds slowly crept eastward, and the lightning and thunder also stopped. The rain also stopped. The twinkling evening stars all appeared in the sky.</p>
<p>People cooling off still enjoyed the gentle cool breeze, gesticulating and talking! They didn't feel the sting of poisonous mosquitoes as if they had lost consciousness!</p>

<h3 id="e281">Mr. Min Lengchan's Painting (Brief Biography) <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Min Lengchan is sixty years old this year. He was young and traveled with many predecessors, and when he grew up, he studied a wide range of books, especially indulging in the study of Song Confucianism. After the age of fifty, he devoted himself to painting and calligraphy. In calligraphy, he followed the style of Yan and Su and later studied Zhang Cao. His painting does not adhere to any one school, but freely expresses his own thoughts. His brushwork uses the suspended arm and central tip, so both his calligraphy and painting are extremely vigorous and profound. Usually, when he paints for guests, he is very oblivious to the presence of others. He once discussed painting with me, saying that there is no other method for writing characters than drawing vertical and horizontal lines. Painting is also like this, so those who can write characters can also paint. His high-mindedness is often like this.</p>
<p>It's getting deeper! All sounds were silent, except for the faint sound of distant dogs barking. A deathly silence was heard! Moonlight shone through the glass window, bathing the small room and stripping away the light of the bean lamp. Tossing and turning in bed made it impossible to fall asleep. I thought of reading a tasteless book, which had the magic power to induce sleep like a lullaby. Before I even started reading, I found a piece of paper that caused sorrow!</p>
<p>This is a receipt! This is the receipt from the last semester of my education five or six years ago! This is the last receipt of my life for schooling! Although the amount on the receipt is only fifty or sixty yuan, which is not enough for a pair of silk stockings or a bottle of perfume in the eyes of the rich, this receipt caused my parents to work hard, worry, and beg for pity before they raised enough money on the day before school started, received this receipt, and completed the last semester of my education. Unfortunately, at the age of eighteen or nineteen, my poor parents no longer worked hard, worried, begged, or pleaded for me. They have exhausted all their efforts and are now resting under the nine springs! It's too late to regret it! Poor students! Strive for your knowledge! Be thrifty with your expenses! Repay your old fathers and mothers for their hard work, worries, begging, and pleading, and serve society and the country!</p>
<h3 id="e282">Secret Poem <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Yi</p>
<p>X School is a very famous middle school in Shanghai, with about a thousand students. Because there are so many students, the school rules are inevitably somewhat lax and cannot be strictly followed. As a result, ambiguous love affairs are often heard of, swallowing copper coins! Exchanging letters and making secret rendezvous! Hanging oneself! Also emerge endlessly. The school authorities, in view of this, specially organized a letter inspection committee. All letters must be reviewed by their | inspection committee staff | before they are returned to the students. Therefore, the general friends of lovers | dare to boldly use bribery in broad daylight. Watermelon seeds, peanuts, and other things to be sucked and chewed have all become their target objects. K is a very famous pretty boy in X Middle School, so of course his love affairs should be more than others, especially the love letters he exchanges can be second to none, worthy of being called unique. Therefore, the staff of the inspection committee also paid special attention to his letters, partly because he refused to bribe. But don't say there wasn't a single love letter, even family letters were rare to come by!</p>
<p>Saturday afternoon, as usual, is the school's Holiday. Everyone can see that his hair is extra shiny, his suit is also extra clean and straight, and his leather shoes are polished to a strange shine.</p>
<p>Their faces are covered with a layer of snow cream that looks like lime; this is to prepare to go to the park with their Love! Watch movies! Open a hotel… K certainly cannot be an exception, and his grooming skills are better than others, and his flattering surgery is also better than others, so today he is dressed as a handsome young man, in a suit and leather shoes, truly a fine young master of the world.</p>
<p>After the sound of a bicycle bell rang, the tea room's Ah San, holding a large bundle of letters, went to the inspection committee room like an arrow.</p>
<p>The scorching sun shrouded the playground. The entrance of the inspection committee room was crowded with people, as if they were facing a great disaster.</p>
<p>"Is there a letter for me?"</p>
<p>"Zhang, if there is a letter for me, please bring it to the dormitory for me."</p>
<p>The inspectors each looked spiritedly. The letters flew past like snowflakes one by one. Suddenly, a pink envelope was exposed in front of everyone's eyes, so everyone stared intently like they were dead. Ah! Inside, it turned out to be a very plain five-character律诗 poem. The original text reads:</p>
<p>What day is today,</p>
<p>How many days and nights are there?</p>
<p>Three days without seeing you,</p>
<p>I miss you all the time.</p>
<p>On the left side of the Falun Temple,</p>
<p>A scholar builds a garden residence.</p>
<p>Public affairs are not asked about,</p>
<p>The garden is accompanied by poetry and books.</p>
<p>Waiting to welcome hermits,</p>
<p>Do not delay your journey.</p>
<p>"Ah! If you read from the beginning, isn't it a love appointment letter saying, 'See you at the French Park at three o'clock today'!" The naughty C-kun shouted loudly as if he had suddenly realized something.</p>
<p>The truth of the case was immediately revealed, and everyone discussed it with啧啧 noises.</p>
<p>A burst of noisy bickering rose from the ground in K-kun's dormitory.</p>
<p>[Haha! What a cunning lover.]</p>
<p>[Hollow! Your skill is really not small. You can actually find such a lover.]</p>
<p>[Your Love is so silly]</p>
<p>K-kun slipped away with a red face and red ears!</p>
<p>When I stepped out of the dormitory, a faint noise was still spinning in the entire corridor.</p>
<h3 id="e283">A' Gou <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>The idiot A' Gou hanged himself. In this day and age, the hanging of one or two people like A' Gou is not a sensational event, especially since he was a criminal?</p>
<p>A' Gou drifted from Shandong to Shanghai, selling his labor and exchanging it for a few pancakes every day. He worked all day long, and time passed so quickly. A' Gou's youth was buried in the ruthless wind and snow. Although he had iron muscles and a strong mind, he gradually felt tired.</p>
<p>In his forties, the idiot was squeezed out of the labor-selling workshop, and the sorrow of unemployment immediately weighed on him. It was already winter, and A' Gou hadn't had any pancakes today. He was only wearing a jacket, shivering and standing by the roadside, like a sick dog about to starve to death.</p>
<p>[As long as you are human, you should have clothes to wear and food to eat. Although the idiot is old, he can still work! Why starve to death?] As he passed by a restaurant, this silly idea attacked his silly brain. The nose smelled the fragrance of fish and meat. Fragrant, idiot, don't you want it? His already hungry eyes widened so much, and he stretched out his dirty hands and broke into the kitchen of the restaurant.</p>
<p>The idiot was sentenced to three months' imprisonment. He sat in a narrow and damp prison cell, stroking the iron bars that were only an inch in diameter. He smiled. [This is not bad. At least there is food to eat]. But the tattered old jacket became a problem. The idiot's old bones couldn't withstand such cold. Leave here, or I'll freeze to death if I stay any longer. The idiot's second thought. So he carried out sabotage work. Late at night, two bricks under the iron window were removed. With unknown strength, a big hole was opened in half an hour. The idiot smiled and climbed out, but the sharp north wind outside ruthlessly pounced on him again.</p>
<p>[Damn it, this wind, do you dare to block my way?] The idiot cursed angrily. As a result, the night guard heard him and caught him back, and he was beaten with a whip. The skin on his back was torn open, and iron chains were added.</p>
<p>[Why did you dig a hole in the wall and escape?]</p>
<p>[What? Escape. It's cold! I don't want to stay here.]</p>
<p>[This is the judgment of the law. You have to live here whether you want to or not.]</p>
<p>[I don't want to. I have to go out. You bully me for being an idiot, idiot!]</p>
<p>[You bastard!]</p>
<p>[Bastard? Why don't you come and stay for a few days? This is the idiot's confession in court.</p>
<p>That night, the idiot had a dream, dreaming that his dead father was waving to him. When he woke up, his legs were already frozen stiff. [Living like this is worse than dying. Dad wants me to go.] When the idiot thought of this, he untied his belt and tied it to the horizontal bar of the iron window, made a knot, and put it around his starved neck. The idiot smiled, and everything was resolved.</p>
<p>The idiot A' Gou hanged himself. In this day and age, the hanging of one or two people like A' Gou is not a sensational event, especially since he was a criminal?</p>
<p>Li Heizi, who used to live with A' Gou, told this story.</p>

<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>(11) [Just listen to Mr. Chen's command for everything.]</p>
<p>Of course, early in the morning, Li Shiqiao and Wang Hua were [walking] on the road.</p>
<p>[Shiqiao, it's really a dead end. The pawnshops are all closed. Otherwise, if I took my wife's clothes, I could still pawn them for] two oceans. I only found eight coins by walking until twelve o'clock last night. Hu Yuanliang is considered generous. It's really not easy to borrow money now!] Shiqiao obviously had no interest in these words. He was thinking about a passionate speech to resist Japan and save the country. Wang Hua immediately changed his tone: [I heard that Lao Chen came from a worker background! What kind of person is he? What do you think of him?]</p>
<p>[I think he's okay. He still has some passion. He is firmly advocating resistance against Japan!]</p>
<p>[Passion?] Xue Wanghua knew what the so-called [passion] of politicians was. He really didn't need to explain to Shiqiao, so he smiled and stopped talking. They walked silently until they reached Chen's mansion.</p>
<p>They waited in the living room for more than half an hour before Chen Tianren strolled out step by step. The servant stood beside him and fanned the door curtain. This scene easily reminded people of the appearance of some high-ranking official appearing on the stage, with gongs and drums sounding loudly. Li Shiqiao and Wang Hua were indeed nervous. Chen Tianren's majesty has always been able to subdue young people, but it is also necessary to show friendliness in the midst of majesty. He let the young people sit down first, and then he sat opposite them, raising his neck and making a condescending posture.</p>
<p>[This is Comrade Wang Hua, the standing committee member and organization minister of the district,] the tall Li Shiqiao stood up first, and the short Wang Hua nodded five or six times to the opposite side. [Comrade Wang has been in Shanghai for many years and is very familiar with all sectors of society.]</p>
<p>Temporary silence.</p>
<p>[Hmm.] Then Chen Tianren looked at the short man for a while, seemingly examining whether this material had any use.</p>
<p>[Mr. Chen!] The material showed that it could say a lot of words, and began unhurriedly with a greeting. [In the past, yes, the authority of the party has indeed declined. In the past, yes, we felt the lack of unified leadership. So it is not easy to concentrate the quantity, so, so Comrade Li, we hope to unite the people of this city during this critical period of resistance against Japan, especially, especially the nationalists and the communists are using this opportunity to stir up trouble. So, so… but we are silent… So… In any case, Wang Hua can only say this point, thinking that he has said too little, desperately continuing, but in fact, saying any more would just be some old clichés. Chen Tianren was getting quite bored listening, and knowingly gave a few noises of [Hmm] and turned his face to Li Shiqiao.</p>
