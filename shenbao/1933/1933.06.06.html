<h3>中美成立新借欵</h3>
<p>五千萬美金購農産</p>
<p>年息五厘三年還本</p>
<p>宋財長已在美簽字</p>
<p>華盛頓美國財政善後銀公司、允以五千萬美元之欵、貸於中國政府、俾其購買美國棉花與小麥、此項協定、已由中國行政院副院長兼財政部長宋子文、與善後银公司總理簽字、此項借欵、利息五釐、三年還本、其五分之四用以購棉、五分之一用以購麥及麫粉、均由中國派員分期向美國市場自由採購、在可能範圍以内、統由美國船舶載運、善後銀公司總理瓊斯宣言、此項借欵、係經羅斯福總统允許而後訂定者、關於此事之談判、去年業巳開始、是時美國西北部小麥出産人、即擬要求銀公司貸欵中國、俾得購買數百萬英斛、嗣因若干責任問題、未能確定、暫作罷論、此次所簽之協定、係按照中國購買美棉麥數量之多寡、以定借欵之額數、據銀公司中人云、以目下市價算、計中國能消納美棉九十萬包以上、消納美麥一千二百五十萬英斛左右、銀公司發表之公報、謂確信此項借欵、於雙方均有利益、美國市場之剩餘、旣可推銷、又可獎勵中國人使用美國之棉麥、而中國經濟亦可由此重行活動此於恢復世界經濟、實有裨益云據聞運費由美國海港出口起、悉由中國擔任、其他雜費亦然、按照協定所载、中國採買棉麥、雖應在六個月期限以内、向美國市塲自由行之、然銀公司亦有權購買聯邦農業理事會所存之貨、用公平價値轉售於中國、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>華盛頓美國財政善後公司允貸中國之美金五千萬元、尙係該公司第二次貸與外國之欵此欵、將由中國用以在美購買農産品、而以棉花爲主、其條件此間皆認爲優惠、即在未交貨前以所購貨物擔保、旣交貨後、由中國指定若干種統稅爲擔保、如捲烟·麫粉·棉紗·火柴等皆在其内、中政府允將此項稅收於三年内分期償付本息、查一九三二年此項稅收、共逹美金二千二百萬元、足敷償債之需、至此項債欵、中國政府立即可以支用、惟所購貨物須向美商訂購、並於可能範圍内交美船運輸其起運時期悉聽中國主張、僅約定貨物自棧房起運時、即從借欵内償付貨價百分之十、其後於九十日内再付百分之十五、餘欵於三年内分償、倘或延期給息五釐、故此項借欵實際等於暫墊貨價性質云、（四日國民電）</p>
<p>南京關於借美欵事今日財政部說明如下、當財政部長宋子文在華盛頓與美總統談論經濟問題時、曾向美國財政善後公司商訂借欵美金五千萬元此欵將用以購買美國棉花小麥輸入中國、（其比額約五分之四購棉花、五分之一購小麥與麫粉）此舉對於美國及中國人民彼此有益、在中國方面他姑不論、即就政府對於内地市塲、可以賒貸棉花小麥、救濟棉荒麥荒、亦能裨益不少云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>華盛頓美國善後銀公司以五千萬美元之欵貸於中國、俾得購買美國棉麥、此事在美國商務上影響若何、政府中人雖不願公開評論、然農業部方面則頗爲滿意謂中國頃向美國購買大批棉麥、其結果之好、顯然可見、尤以在棉花市塲爲甚因中國能購之棉、不下九十四萬包故也、擔任監視農業救濟法實施情形之皮克氏昨日宣言、美國所存之棉截至七月一日止可逹一千三百萬包、小麥截止七月一日止、存貨總數與去年相等即三萬萬六千萬英斛、而中國所能購買者不過一千二百萬斛、農部中人以爲中國雖購用美國棉麥、然農業救濟因限制小麥産量增加、而征收之特别稅、不見能以豁免若干人又以爲棉花出産人自農業救濟法頒布以後、又發生種種希望、結果將使棉花産额增加數百萬包、而中或採買美棉之良好結果、自爲之抵銷凈盡矣云云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>歡迎馬蘇兩將軍歸國　　東</h3>
<p>艱苦抗日之民族英雄馬占山蘇炳文將軍一行。已於昨晚抵滬矣。在强寇緊迫河北停戰言和之今日。吾人歡迎此百戰歸來之抗日領袖。一方面固衷心欽崇。表示無上之敬意。而另一方面則又覺百　叢集悲憤末能自禁。　　迥溯九一八禍變爆發之初。東北負有守土重責之長官。或則全師引退。拱手迎敵。或則望風投降甘心爲虎作倀。乃在此廉恥掃地人情憤激之際。馬將軍於前年十一月初即崛起黑省。孤軍抗爭。嫩江一役。震動中外使全國人之精神爲之一振。國際人士之耳目。爲之一新。至去年十二月初又有拜泉之激戰。彈盡援絶。萬不獲巳始與蘇炳文將軍等退入蘇境。吾人回憶其當日通電中。謂「一口氣尙在。决不將國土拱手讓人。軍隊完了。到黑東練民團再幹」又對美記者云。「雖剩一騎一卒亦必堅持到底。」斬釘截鐵之語令人如聞其聲。蘇炳文將軍於去年九月二十七日在中東路展開抗日之旗幟後亦迭挫强敵。最後於十二月四日晚。忍痛退入蘇境。當時通電中亦謂「退向蘇聯國境。擬即借道回國另行工作。與寇周旋一息尙存。此志不懈」如兩將軍者誠所謂「疾風知勁草。版蕩識誠臣。」其艱苦卓絶。實足以愧死一般苟且偷生之不抵抗軍人與覥無廉恥甘心爲虎作倀之國奸。吾人設想假如我全國軍人皆爲馬蘇。則我國國土斷不至被敵刦奪如是之廣大。如是之神速然而環顧國内。馬蘇究有幾人。而欲國家不亂不弱。不受人侵凌與宰割其可得乎抑吾人尙有不得不向馬蘇兩將軍進言者。今日雖河北之戰事之停和平之說囂然而作。然而此種忍痛犧牲之變相屈服。我全國人民究無不隠痛於心。民視最明。民聽最聰觀乎前年九一八以來全國人民對抗日將士與義勇軍之踴躍捐輸。就可徴民意之所嚮。兩將軍祖宗坵墓所在之地今已夷爲狐鬼横行之區。昔年袍澤。都作烈鬼。而自身亦被迫退入鄰國幾於有國莫救今日萬里歸來。翹首北顧。寗能不椎心泣血悲憤無窮則今後其將如何繼續奮鬥以慰國人之仰望乎此其一也次之兩將軍此行曾觀光蘇聯亦曾觀光全歐諸國。時代潮流之趨向。與各國立國之道。想都巳有詳細比較之觀察則中國今日之所以積弱不振其　結究何在而今後欲維護其生存自由其道又何在。時代文明。日益邁進。今日之軍人。不應僅知馳騁疆塲。爲國效命對於時代潮流與世界政治經濟之情勢。固無不應有相當之認識。則兩將軍對於我國之前途。其亦有所見所得乎。</p>
<p>總之吾人今日之所以歡迎兩將軍者。以其能爲民族生存而抗日也今者東北四省失地未復。而濼東諸地。亦尙陷於敵人之手。國土日蹙。國人所以期望於兩將軍者至大。兩將軍將何以貫澈其初衷。實踐其誓言乎吾人引領望之矣。</p>

<p>南京中央五日晨八時、舉行八十一次紀念週到居正·汪兆銘·陳樹人·李敬齊·鄭占南·葉楚傖·經亨頣·王祺·蕭忠貞·及全體職員約計千人居正主席汪兆銘作報告、至九時半散會、茲纪汪兆銘報告槪要於次、</p>
<p>㈠首述本星期内最重要之事、無過於河北停戰、五月三十一日由九江回抵南京、所發表之談話、及六月二日所發之通電巳經說明、本來河北停戰與去年淞滬停戰、其性質大致相同、限於軍事、不涉政治但是就形勢論却有不同、淞滬停戰結果、日兵是下船回國、而河北停戰結果、日兵最多不過撤至長城以外、我若承認、似乎承認長城以外之巳非我之領土、但是在事實、在理論上、都不是如此的、譬如有一個人住着一間屋子、硬被别人佔去了、和他講理不聽、和他打架反被他打出大門、　到街心、身負重傷、動彈不得、暂時躺在街心、這自然是倒霉極了、伹這個人並没有承認將這房子讓與他、尤其没有將房産契據交給他由、此可知河北停戰、决不能認作放棄長城以外以爲非我之領土、</p>
<p>㈡次述中國旣簽名於關於世界和平之各種公約、則遇有國際糾紛、自當以和平解决爲正當方法、而國聯及簽约各國、共同負責來解决中日糾紛並非有偏向於那一國、乃是論定中日問題爲世界問題之一部份、爲維持世界和平計、不能不共同解决中日糾紛、關於此一點、日本輿論對於中國諸多責難、以爲中國還是沿用「以夷制夷」的老法子、這是絶大的誤會、中國如果無端挑撥各國加危害於日本、自然是中國不對、然事實並不如、此乃日本加危害於中國、例如一個人被危害的時候、不能禁其不呼救、而且國際合作、是世界的趨勢、中國與日本旣不能超越於世界以外、則不能違反國際合作的趨勢、而且國際合作是以公道爲主以互利爲主、以國際合作來解决中日糾紛、於那一國的體面上實質上、都無損礙的、我以爲日本輿論、如果明白此點、便不會有「以夷制夷」的誤會、况且日本輿論、中明明白白也有一部份本知道着重於中日共存、而不以侵略爲然的、欲使這一部份的輿論能在日本見之實行、一方固然要日人之努力、一方也要中國人之努力、如果以兩國人之努力、使中日共存之主張得以實行、這於以國際合作解决中日糾紛、不但没有相妨、而且正是相輔而行的、那麽「以夷制夷」的誤會、更不烦言而自解了、㈢末述以武力收復失地、這句話似不完備的、至少應該說以國力收復失地因爲武力祇是國力之一部份、而且武力充足是國力發達之結果、國力不發達武力是不會充足的我們今日固然要注重充足武力、尤其要注重發達國力、這是救亡圖存之根本辦法、（五日中央社電）</p>

<h3>日領署昨開長江警務會議</h3>
<p>内容秘密不可究詰</p>
<p>但其野心深堪注意</p>
<p>新聲社云、日本在華領署、自九一八·一二八·之後、忽獨開國際約法之先例、竟自創設警署、陰謀刦奪我國警權、藉以保障其經濟與政治之侵略、近且爲謀各地領署警力之聯絡、更由東京外務省派岩崎領事來滬、召開長江各地領館附设之警署署長會議、各地署、長現巳有五人抵滬、該會議亦巳照預定於昨日上午九時半、在本埠日總領事署開始舉行、出席者除漢口·蕪湖·南京·蘇州·濟南·靑島·等地署長外、尙有石射總領事岩崎領事、上海署長　　及、其他關係者共二十五人、石射致訓詞謂領署之設警署、及舉行署長會議、在日外務省、尙屬初次、應認識中日之國際關係、及此特殊之使命、岩崎則代表内田外相嘉獎各地警署在此中日糾紛非常時期中之盡職、並每人贈致紀念袖口一付、後推　　爲議長、開始討論一切、内容絶不對外發表、惟聞除决定各種協助日商務發展、谋抵制我民衆反日運動、及防止日僑鮮人台人之思想惡化等、辦法以外、尙將集中討論於增加警額問題、會議定今日結束、據識者觀察、日方此舉、有極嚴重之意義云、</p>
<h3>中華工業廠决定長期停工</h3>
<p>廠長被工人包圍</p>
<p>滬西白利南路中華工業廠、近因迭受市面淸淡之影響、致營業一落千丈、遂陷於無法維持之境、迫不得已、業於本月一日起實行停止工作、全體男女工人八百餘名、因生計從此斷絶、要求廠方繼續開廠、維持生活不得要領、昨日發生糾紛、詳情探錄於下、</p>
<p>停止工作該廠因受市面蕭條之影響、以致營業日益減色、虧折雖甚巨大然仍勉力维持乃自本年以來、營業幾告停顿、於是竟至無法維持、遂於六月一日實行停止工作、全體男女工人八百餘名、莫不呈露驚慌、僉以廠方現雖略爲虧折、而前數年間、則所得盈餘亦頗不惡、故一致要求廠方維持原狀、繼續開工、</p>
<p>廠方通告廠方是否繼續工作、因須於三日、經董事會討論議决、恐工人發生紛擾、故於一日發出通告、略謂、自本日停工以後、每工每日發給津貼兩角除花帶部内、尙有三十餘工人仍在工作外、其餘一律照給故全體工人、祇得靜待廠方之答復、</p>
<p>發生糾紛　三日董事會開會討論後、仍以無法维持、决定長期停工、乃四日適逢星期昨日全體工人、均到廠候命、當由廠長戚福銘到廠婉辭向工人報告、决定長期停工、津貼亦即取消、全體工人聞悉之下、秩序頓形紊亂、遂將戚廠長圍繞廠内不放外出、該管六區得報後、譚區長立即派警前往查明具報、至傍晚、時聞戚廠長仍未得出廠</p>

<h3>救濟華茶步驟</h3>
<p>商檢局擬具方案</p>
<p>銀錢業儘量調劑</p>
<p>華茶爲我國特産、今受日本印度錫蘭爪哇等茶竸爭以致銷路慘落而居世界出口數第一位之華茶、已退到於後之爪哇茶之下茶商瀕於危境、國際贸易局曾召茶商集議救濟、商品檢騐局長擬具改進華茶方案、實行改良組織運銷合作社由银錢業儘量調劑、茲誌詳情如下、</p>
<p>失敗原因商品檢騐局長蔡無忌改進華茶方案茲摘錄如後、華茶失敗原因、㈠生産者缺乏協同的組織、㈡栽培茶葉、不用科學方法、㈢稅則繁重㈣政治不安、㈤其他各國用其全副精神獎勵鼓吹從事改良世界茶葉數量、紅茶佔十分之九、綠茶佔十分之一、銷路俄國爲大宗、菲洲美國英國次之、一九一五年華茶輸出總値五千五百五十六萬海關兩、一九三二年華茶輸出總値僅二千四百七十六海關兩、</p>
<p>調查考察欲圖華茶對内事業之改善、與對外贸易之擴充、其辦法須積極調查、各省栽培製造狀况、各産茶國改良步驟、預定即分派人員、詳查閩浙皖贛及兩湖産茶區域之狀况、以後再往雲南·贵州·四川·陜西·甘肅·等地同時至日本·台灣·印度·錫蘭·爪哇·等地考察、以爲改善栽製方法之參考、一面派遣熟悉海外贸易者、赴各國作直接之調查或宣傳、並在各國駐外使館、設置商務參贊、報告并調查各該國商業情形、至於西藏蒙古各地、亦須詳加調查、</p>
<p>（試騐研究）關於研究試騐者、亟宜籌设试騐及研究機關、對於施肥剪枝耕耘摘採等方法妥爲試騐、醱酵乾燥貯藏等技術、詳加研究、並將各地土宜各項茶類、作精密之分析、藉資比較、關於試騐研究事項、商口檢騐局除與安徽湖南兩茶業試騐所聯絡外、并與實業中央農業實駖所、漢口商品檢騐局、租賃寗州振植公司、設合辦茶業改良塲、分别研究試騐、並招收各地茶業子弟、予以相當訓練、</p>
<p>（宣傳指導）華茶對外之失敗在無宣傳、各省茶業製品之不良、在無指導、如初步之培肥剪枝摘採烘焙等事、應即編印小册、廣爲散發、派員赴各地作調查工作時、隨時講演說、明華茶失敗之歷史及應行改善之方針、以喚起茶户及製造家之注意至於對外宣傳、應從速派遣專員、在國外需茶各國盡量宣傳、或指定鉅欵、在歐美重要都市之雜誌報章、刋登有力之廣告、放映華茶實際情形影片、利用各國舉行博覽會時作盛大之宣傳、或在重要都市、開設吃茶店、供給試飲、</p>
<p>（保護獎勵）保護獎勵爲政府應盡之責任、但目下如閩浙皖贛及湖南邊界、凡屬産茶區域均爲匪徒出没之區、以致商人裹足不前茶葉無法運出、消極的辦法亦須充分保護茶商採運、以免危險、至言獎勵則如提倡茶業合作社之共同栽製優良茶園、及品質最高茶葉之予以獎勵、開闢新茶園及試用新戒機械者之予以鼓勵、直接出口茶商及製造新式製茶機械予以特别津貼、尤要者爲由國庫担保、使茶商流通低利之資金、並派員聯絡需要最大之俄國美國、協商直接購買等等方法、皆至切要、</p>
<p>（改良茶葉）新聲社記者昨晤商品檢騐局技術官吳覺農、據稱商品檢騐局、以華茶之失敗、最重要者爲我國茶葉、製法守舊、以致貨品運輸不便、剥削太多、以致成本增加、故特聯合漢口商品檢騐局、中央農業實騐所、於本年四月間、承租江西寗州白鵬壩地方寗茶振植公司、改爲寗州合辦茶葉改良塲、從事改良、至於寗州茶葉運滬後、經試騐進步、再交在華茶葉銷路最大之英商錦隆洋行研究、現色哇味巳可和印錫相等、</p>
<p>（運銷合作）祁門茶葉　爲我國茶業之王、因交通不便、山價和市價相　在一倍以上安徽省政府建設廳、在前國立茶葉試騐塲舊址、創辦省立茶葉改良場、備有各種新式機械改良製造方法、并組織祁門平里村無限責任信用運銷合作社第一批祁門茶、現巳運滬、湖南省政府在安化地方、亦辦有茶事試騐塲、從事改良、比較日本綠茶爲佳、以前之不能改製綠茶者今巳成功、</p>
<p>（借欵救濟）華茶對外贸易失敗後、實業部曾令本市銀錢兩業同業公會對於茶葉金融、儘量調劑、由交通部鐵道部令招商局曁兩路管理局、設法減輕茶葉運費、并爲救濟起見、由國際贸易局爲茶商與銀錢業接洽進行借欵、、以信用爲擔保、聞總數爲五百萬元</p>

<h3>紗廠原料恐慌聲中美棉傾銷前途堪虞</h3>
<p>但土棉攙潮之風實自殺政策</p>
<p>倘再不亟改良棉産從此休矣</p>
<p>本市中外紗廠之原料棉花、發生缺乏恐慌、日前市府等集議救濟華商紗廠時、曾决定電美宋部長設法、新聲社記者、昨聞商品檢騐局等探得詳情如下、</p>
<p>棉産槪况我國棉花、各地均産、二十年産額、爲六百三十九萬九千七百八十担、二十一年産額爲八百十萬零五千六百三十七担、而全國紗廠、銷用棉花、二十年爲八百十五萬九千九百六十八担、二十一年爲八百九十六萬五千九百三十五担、在世界經濟不景氣之際、美國棉花實行對華傾銷、以致國棉價格、比較美棉不合算加以國棉運　不便、品質不齊、大受美棉影響、</p>
<p>美棉輸入我國棉花、攙雜攙潮之風、日見蔓延凡屬棉區均染此種惡習實則損害棉質、紡織工程、因受障礙、各華商紗廠採用美棉因此增加、如民國二十一年之輸入、外棉爲三百七十一萬二千八百五十六担、國棉亟宜改良、否則將受外棉影響、市價爲其操縱、今各省深鑒於此、巳從事於推廣良棉工作、購買美耔、分發農民、</p>
<p>傾銷堪虞國産棉花、因時局影響及成本過重之關係、産額减、少而今年上市棉花美棉須十月間、土種須九月間、在此靑黃不接之際、發生缺乏恐慌存棉不足一月需、用但美棉絡續已運滬各紗廠無多大問題、但外棉進口稅之豁免實爲不可因全國纱廠、中日各半、萬一豁免進口稅、則國棉勢必更受打擊、外棉傾銷、益加爲日人謀利益、</p>

<h3>市敎育會發表一一敎運宣言</h3>
<p>中國的病　是愚弱私窮</p>
<p>民衆敎育是治病的基礎</p>
<p>捐洋一元一人讀書一月</p>
<p>捐洋四元培　一人畢業</p>
<p>上海市敎育會昨發表一元一月敎育運重宣言如中國的病　是「愚」「弱」「私」「窮」、愚的使他智、弱的使他强、私的使他公、窮的使他富、其基本方法就是敎育、中國人口有四萬萬七千萬之多、而没有受過國民敎育的占着全數百分之八十五、約有四萬萬零七百五十萬之　換句話說、一百個中國人讀過書的祇有十五人、而没有讀過書的却有八十五人在此情形之下、中華民族安得不愚、安得不弱、安得不私、安得不窮愚了、弱了、私了、窮了、中華民國安得不做殖民地、中國人安得不做亡國奴、愚的使他智、弱的使他强、私的使他公、窮的使他富我們安可不提倡敎育、我們安可不提倡民衆敎育、</p>
<p>民衆敎育是訓練成年男女的敎育、是打倒愚弱私窮的基本方法因爲民衆敎育包含四種敎育、㈠　字敎育、㈡健康敎育、㈢公民敎育、㈣生計</p>
<p>敎育、識字敎育可以打倒愚、健康敎育、可以打倒弱、公民敎育可以打倒私、生計敎育可以打倒窮、識字敎育成功了人民可以變愚爲智、健康敎育成功了人民可以變弱爲强公民敎育成功了、人民可以變私爲公、生計敎育成功了人民可以變窮爲富、智了、强了、公了、富了、社會何愁不富國家何愁不强、中國還會受外國人欺侮麽、所以民衆敎育簡直是救國的一種基本工作我們要救國我們就得努力提倡民衆敎育、</p>
<p>民衆敎育的方式很多如創　民衆學校、舉行通俗演講、緼印通俗讀物、设立合作社、民衆圖書館、民衆敎育館、民衆體育場民衆茶園、改良書場等其中最有效的要算民衆學校、民衆學校是可以兼辧上面所說的四種敎育的、但是誰肯賠錢、來辦這種民衆學校呢、政府吧、政府現在財政困難、已辦　大中小學校尙難維持有何餘力來辦民衆學校、試看上海、二十一年度上海全年敎育經費是一百二十二萬元、而民衆敎育經費（句括體育場及民衆敎育館等）祇有六萬八千八百九十二元、約占全數百分这五·六每月衹有五千七百三十一元、（根據敎部統計）這筆欵項、就是完全來辦民衆學校也不能造就多少學生、何况大部份還用在别種事業上面呢、所以辦理民衆學校事實上祇有我們民衆自己、</p>
<p>本會是上海大中小學校的總集　、是上海敎育界的中心組心組織、這種重大的責任我們不敢抛棄不順、我們打算　民衆的前　、率先提倡這種敎育運動、補助政府的不足、又因辦理民衆學校的經費、包括贈送學生的書藉纸　筆硯以及日常開支、敎員津貼、每一事生平均每月約需洋一元、而捐洋一元、卽可培植一個同胞讀書一月、所以定名爲「一元一月敎育運動」本會誓以最經濟最公開的方法支配欵項、並以最切實最有效的方法辦理學校、</p>

<p>今日六六敎師節</p>
<h3>敎師節致語潘公展</h3>
<p>從敎師們對於敎育事業的勞績以及使命來說、决不是僅僅一天的紀念所能報償、所能表見但是、我們不能忽視這一個節日、我們更要認識這一個節日所给予我们的鼓勵、</p>
<p>講到「師」在我國社會中一向是被尊敬的、丨丨遇遇所謂「天地君親師」固然是一種封建的型式、没有什麽意義但於此、也可以見得社會對於「師」的重視丨丨可是近年來、因爲我國「固有的道德」的消沉、在浮　的學風之下、所謂「師道」、也就祇成爲一種歷史上的嘉言而不再有什麽特殊的開展了、</p>
<p>自然「師道」之所以衰替、一方面固然是因爲受敎者的玩忽、但又一方面却也不能不說是因爲敎師自己的插視、從前有句話「敎不嚴、師之惰、」固然我們不希望個個敎師板起面、孔硬做出一副「師嚴道尊」的神氣、但試問現在能夠自己敎得起來而足以受學生尊敬的敎師、其於全體敎師中所佔百分比有多少呢、所以在這「敎師節、」我覺得從「敎師」這一點意義上推論就有許多話可說、</p>
<p>「敎師」、自然不是說受敎者應該視師若神明、但至少我們總要使受敎者知道師之所以爲師、至於敎師自已呢、却不能把被「敬」作爲自己應該有的權利、不過受敎者對於良好的敎師應該有這一種義務罷了、丨丨這是第一點意義、</p>
<p>師之所以爲師、在能善用其敎如果不能勝任那就不但「誤人」而且足以「誤國」丨丨這種敎師、又怎樣能夠受人尊敬呢、丨丨所以、在這敎師節、每個敎師都應該自己省察自己勗勵、對遇去作一檢查對未來樹一標的、這是第二點意義、</p>
<p>從敎學的方法講自然我們不能否認新敎育是比較科學化但他細研究起來、我國舊的敎學方法却也有它適合新的敎育原理的特殊的長處、丨丨我國舊時敎師對於受敎者輒用個别敎學法、易見效果、卽可證實我言、（而且、對於受敎者、責任心很重、師生相處絶少隔膜、）在這敎師節、　我希望我們的敎師能夠多與受敎者接近、以免除師生間的不了解、</p>
<p>現在、國難方殷、我民族國家所期待於敎師的努力更覺急切日俄戰後、日本人把勝利的功勞歸在小學敎師身上、同樣的我也希望我們的敎師遇着今年今日的敎師節的時候、想一想眼前的敎育的環境和環境的需要而積極努力、丨丨敎師節雖然一瞬即逝、但敎師節的意義總應該常常存在的吧、</p>
<p>希望敎師們放大眼光、看一看整個的國家和民族的危　、不要祇顧小我的權利同時、祝護敎師們的偉大的工作的成功、</p>
<h3>敎師節的一段小史　叔異</h3>
<p>我國沿用的各種節日、像勞工節、婦女節、兒童節、母親節大都是外國送給我們的禮物、不過經國人斟酌國情加以改造、有的已經政府核准製定紀念辦法、有的雖没有經過政府正式的規定、因爲提倡已久社會上大都明白牠們的意義、惟有敎師節（六月六日）是國人自己創造的、還說不到什麽歷史、因爲在前年（民國二十年）京滬一部份敎育界同志們才發起的去年各省市敎育界雖有盛大的紀念會、畢竟在時罕上還比不上其他的節日來時家喻户曉婦孺皆知、所以這個敎師節正靠我們敎育界工作同志們的努力呢、記者在這這襄特别要把提倡敎師節的一段小史寫出來、也爲着這個緣由、</p>
<p>敎師節的提倡民國二十年京滬漢敎育界同志三百餘人爲謀敎育人待遇改良、地位穏固、修養增進起見、定是日爲敎師節、在首都中央大學舉行第一次慶祝儀式、中央黨部及敎育部均派員參加、極一時之盛、</p>
<p>提倡敎師節的目標敎育事業是整個國家的行政、敎師是促進社會民族新生命的原動力、提倡敎師節當然是替國家民族打算、可是事實上重視敎育、應先重視敎師做起、所以敎師節運動目標一是改良待造、二是保障地位、三是增進休養爲什麽我國敎師要有這三種運動目標當然是爲着勞苦功高的敎師們是負有改造社會國家之責以示國家尊重敎師之意</p>
<p>歴屆各地慶祝狀况自民國二址年六月六日後各地敎育界每逢是日、必有敎師聯合舉行慶祝典禮、茲將歷屆各地敎育界慶祝敎師節狀况略述如下、</p>
<p>㈠民國二十年京滬漢敎育界同志、發起籌備敎師節、是日在南京避央大學大禮堂舉行敎師節第一次成立大會及慶祝儀式、</p>
<p>㈡民國二十一年是年爲成立敎師節後之第一週年各地敎育界同志值行慶祝儀式更爲熱烈上海申報首先　充　幅、廣　敎育界同志惠賜關於敎師節文字以資宣傳、至各地舉行敎師慶祝式者、有南京徐州鎭江開封上海杭州梧州等處</p>
<h3>敎師節之意義　黃增祥</h3>
<p>民國二十年五月間敎育家　爽秋程其保等、鑒於國内敎育人員等遇菲薄地位不穏、及缺乏修養機會、遂約合敎界同志創議设立敎師以謀補救爲便於號召起見、議定該節日在每年六月六日（故又名雙六節）舉行、假首都中央大學舉行第一次慶祝儀式、與會者京滬氏敎育同志三百餘人頗極一時之盛、茲節錄敎師節發起人之宣言數段、藉窺該節日之意義、</p>
<p>「夫小學敎師之俸給、不足以爷仰事俯蓄、此固盡人皆知者卽大學中學敎師時因欠發薪水、生活每起恐慌、疾病而不克醫藥、學校復靳其俸給年高而不勝繁劇、學校復解其職位、生活代價與家庭負擔與年俱進而學並無年功加俸之制不幸在職病故、身後蕭條任其妻子凍餒、而學校又無撫卹之條┆┆、、此敎師生活所以至不安定而極應力謀改善者也</p>
<p>「至言敎師之地位徴諸事實、恒視學生之好惡及其他特别原因爲進退、對於敎育之功績與處世之忠誠如何、則非所問已　毫無保障、而復因政局變化、校長更換黨派傾軋、社會排擠、時有朝不保夕之勢、┆┆此敎師地位所以到不穏固、而極應力謀改善者也、</p>
<p>「優良敎師之養成同賴社會扶植、乃通常辦法、對於修養不足之敎師、惟知檢定淘汰、其於被淘汰者、又多不謀　救、至對於修養較深者、則畀以極繁重之課務、使其無暇研究此種辦法、無異絶敎師進修之路而廢棄其有用之材則雖有學力優異之士亦將永遠埋没、不克發展其較遜者、更將永無上進之望、┆┆此敎師缺乏之專業修養機會、而極應力謀增進者也、</p>
<p>「至本節日運動之目標、不外下述三點㈠改良敎師待遇、㈡保障敎師地位、㈢增進敎師修養、」就宣言所述、敎師節以僅爲敎師說法、實則所謂敎師、者係指一切敎育人員而言不過以「敎師」二字爲代表、便於號召而已、至所定運動目標不僅爲敎師爭權利、而福國利民之旨、實亦寓於不其中此一點在第一次敎師節舉行時、、發起人固曾向聽衆有明白之表示也、</p>
<p>敎師節之倡行、爲時不過兩年、而各地已歡欣歌舞踴躍慶祝、將來之發展定可預卜、尤望敎育部能於最近期内明令規定六月六日爲敎師節紀念日並通令全國敎育界一致值行慶祝俾得與兒童婦女勞動諸節先後比美最後並盼我國敎育界人士聯合全世界各國敎師、定六月六日爲國　敎師節日、、共慶杏壇設敎之樂趣而謀世界和平之實現</p>
<h3>我們的生路　陳際雲</h3>
<p>在八年前的日記簿上寫着「┆我們的老師、早早的起來、　學生未來、改削作文本、檢查演算本、遲遲的睡眠、爲的要預備第二天的功課、只有吃飯的時間好像是自己的到厠所的時間、都不讓他自由的、像現在天氣之熱他們的土布長衫或蚅布的學生裝、還是不能脫去、背上汩汩的汗只是向认衣外流出手、上滿沾白粉、有時連衣衫上也沾滿、但忘記了自己、無暇顧及衣服容貌這一類的事了、</p>
<p>他見了一位生客就深深的鞠躬走近來與他招呼、問他是要找那一個學生他的慌張將使人發笑、但他的憔悴將立刻仰住你的笑聲、</p>
<p>一忽兒、一個同學氣喘得胸腔一高一低的、「張三打我、」又有五個同學說、「李四在操塲上跌了他在哭呢、」於是我們的老師背了汗又慌張的出去了┆」</p>
<p>這是在八年前的日記、描寫我們的老師、在現在看來、好像也就是描寫自己、從這短短的日記裏就可以知道我們敎師的生活了</p>
<p>唉、政局不上正軌一切都在紊亂時代、本來談不到敎育、更還談什麽優待敎師不過我們一方面覺得楊腹從公呼　無門另一方面又覺得國家的沉淪、我們的工作更屬重要、我們不得不鼓着勇氣、努力我們的工作、同時不得不呻吟着、設法救濟事實上的苦痛、仰　人家是没有希望的了、我們還是退回來謀諸自己、本互助自决的精神、謀適當的组合、也許可以解除一部分的困難、找到一條相當的生路、</p>

<h3>東華足球隊征菲記㈠</h3>
<p>第一戰和西班牙俱樂部</p>
<p>陳洪光陳家球先後立功</p>
<p>李義臣受傷成各二各局</p>
<p>（本報駐菲記者文初自馬尼拉發）</p>
<p>在遠東運動會時我國足球大足爲理亞病夫吐氣、數年來南來北征菲者、有樂華·曁南·南華諸足球隊、當時曁南以大舉錦標隊資格、又值嘉年華會開幕、得華僑商工學各界先事鼓吹、故社會上另有一種緊張氣象、當每陣皆捷、無堅不破、惜臨别時、節外生枝、與聖彼達學校、再作友誼比賽、以三比○大負特負舊事重提、猶有餘恨南華隊之來、聲勢更爲浩大若李惠堂孫錦順皆以球界宿將身臨前敵連戰皆大獲勝算、每塲竟非一二球之差、曾記與全菲冠軍隊比賽、爲六與○之場面、奈適一二八事發生、所有稿件、皆擱而不用、致消息無由傳播於全國、乘此時機補述幾句以表揚過去南華足球隊之光榮、</p>
<p>東華來菲之動機在遠東運動會中、菲律賓選手各項運動、幾皆居上選唯足球歴屆皆爲我國所敗、其處心積慮欲在球藝上求進步與深造、則觀摩與切磋之功爲不可少、故此地冠軍聖彼達體育會球、隊遂邀我執上海甲組足球公開比賽牛耳之東華球隊來岷與之比賽、其往來旅資、開食宿等費、由彼供給入場劵由彼收入、其用意卽在觀摩中求進境也、</p>
<p>到埠時歡迎盛况東華隊二十六日由香港搭俄國皇后船來岷、十一時登岸、聖彼達學校體育會、西班牙俱樂部體育會、中菲體育界名人并各日報記者、皆到七號碼頭歡迎、諸球員制服爲白衣籃褲花條紋長　、其中馮運佑·陳家球·染樹經數度來此、大展其好身手舊夢重温、亦靑年時期中不得多得之快事、現皆寄宿於中華靑年會、取其食宿等事較爲便當也、</p>
<p>比賽秩序这排定據所宣佈者如左五月廿八日東華對開雪謊西班牙俱樂部</p>
<p>五月　一日東華對波希米體育會</p>
<p>六月四日東華對彼達大學</p>
<p>六月六日東華對全菲選手隊</p>
<p>六月八日　同上</p>
<p>六月十一日同上（未定）</p>
<p>該籌備委員會、其所以組全菲選手隊、最後與東華隊比賽連續三場作戰之意義、據該會執事人解釋、謂菲體育界咸認東華爲中國足球界上乘球隊之一、球員均爲第一流選手、實力至爲雄厚、而全菲選手、將合精銳聯合成軍、欲求各選手彼此有精密聯絡起見、不得不予以充鈖時間之練習、以便對東華時得有良好之成續至連續比賽三塲、原採三戰兩勝制、因明年遠東運動會開幕在卽、菲足球欲爲積極訓練、莫若與外國足球勁敵、作實地比賽、以資借鑑、爲來屆遠東運動會之準備、</p>
<p>菲人唯恐東華不勝菲人此舉純爲嚴密訓練起見、其目的固不在於勝負且此舉破費將近萬元、其入塲劵十之七八、視我華僑參加之高興、故華方歷塲如無大勝特勝、堪爲在塲華人增光者、則誰肯破鈔而丢臉故菲方籌備者、深恐前一二場華方球隊之不勝</p>
<p>華僑對勝負心理本來足球隊南來、皆知操必勝之勢、足爲匣際上爭地位、故對常勝軍之球員、視若神聖、街談　議、幾皆談今日比賽成績、在場中勝一球、其呐喊助威、勢直足以撼山嶽、自東北淪亡、長城　陷國際地位墜落難言、僑衆心理視一區區球隊、卽全　勝數、亦不足爲榮、敗亦無可增辱、國事敗壞至此、無怪海外僑衆對國内事業皆大灰心也、</p>
<h3>第一場和西班牙２丨２</h3>
<p>兩方威風凛凛五月二十八日爲東華足球隊到岷後第一塲比賽之期、對方爲西班牙俱樂部體育會、下午四時十分、東華隊健兒於熱烈掌聲中虎步道先登場練習、繼而西班牙隊亦於歡呼聲　出馬、各據一方試練脚、頭東華衣白衫藍袴、配以黃黑橫間球襪守門陸鍾恩衣紅衣、西隊則藍衣白褲黑襪、藍白相映可觀、球證亞馬素朱拉氏召集兩隊健兒、在塲中央合照一影、以留紀念後、即由兩方隊長作擇門之舉、東華得背日順風之利、四時半請岷市長恩蕭氏行門球禮、球證銀笛一聲、　市長隨以脚踢球、戰雲遂啟、</p>
<p>東華足球隊與西班牙西班牙體育會足球隊合影（文初自馬尼拉寄）</p>
<p>敵方初取攻勢敵方乘我方不慣球場地勢之弱點、交綏之下、卽主攻勢、用丰傳遞以搗我腹地、屠開元首先迎敵、稍顯頭　、將球頂舉李義臣、李再傳與陳　添、陳從右路進襲、離敵門十五碼遥射、惜不慣塲地、致球勢欠準、遂未奏效、其後爲西軍所得、猛烈環攻、均爲我軍坐鎭南天門之孫思敬打退、全場讚爲鐵門、但西軍經一番阻撓、多一次進攻故我方營壘、卽被侵擾數次、所幸馮運佑之　球、與李寗頭頂之神妙、致西軍無功而還者屢、東華前鋒五虎、因塲地生疏、舒展失常傳遞亦不能節節合拍、兩翼雖有美妙之傳遞、李義臣陳洪光陳家球相當之合拍、射門時總失之毫厘、幸我軍二道防綫均固、致西軍進攻無路、只見球來球往、　不見激烈之戰况、</p>
<p>兩陳開新紀錄兩軍　戰約十五分鐘、東華以短傳遞、攻破西軍第一道防綫、　正在第二道防綫混戰之中、李義臣得陳　添之接濟、而傳與陳洪光、陳不負使命左路奔前一脚、球低目急、菲方號稱鐵門之加兩爾些雖向有仆地撲救已無及矣、東華遂開紀錄、掌聲大起於四座東華自得此球後、精神爲之一振、進攻益見勇猛、故不施踵萬象華從左路奪球、遠射中落點至佳、短小精悍之陳家球、以時機不可錯過、趁球未着地之前、認定目標、頭鎚一試、加爾些措手不及、球遂應聲入、網</p>
<p>李義臣被撞傷敵方經此挫敗、除令後衛加緊堅守防綫外、前鋒拚命死攻、均爲孫思敬屠開元梁樹棠打退、其正前鋒衝過我一道防綫後、立卽從中猛射、球之來勢甚危、幸爲陸鍾恩接得踢出、李義臣衝前跳高迎之以頭、被西隊左衛一撞出効力全塲鼓掌迎之休息之銀笛已鳴、東華以二對○佔先、</p>
<p>敵方老將出馬休息旣過、雙方易地而戰、西隊則略有調動、其右翼在上半塲、足部受傷、由一頭已秃而年四十餘歲之老足球健將伊　士地氏ＹＣＨＡＵＳＴＩ替補此群藝雖退化、但打來極見奮勇、大有老當益壯之精神、當下場時、全塲報以不省掌聲、</p>
<p>反攻來勢甚猛續賽後、西隊乘東華鬆懈之間努力反攻、頗見得手、東華門前險象環生者數次、斯時陸鍾恩成衆矢之的、左擋右截、極見　敏、誠不失爲困守孤城之良將、但戰情已由平淡而至緊雙言血戰當中、東華前鋒李義臣、猶以腰傷未愈、連失良機二次、因此對方前鋒、、漸見佳境、</p>
<p>中調虎難山計時敵方來勢愈猛、右衛與左衛時有良好表演、互相攻守之際、我方陸鍾恩亦欲大顯其身手、遥見左方高射一球時、誤以球勢近門而攻者尙遠、以爲可將球踢出、不料出門過遠、而敵乃非慢脚者流、待球落地反彈之附飛奔迎之、殆陸返身時、已無及矣、於是我方鐵城遂破、</p>
<p>近畿四面皆敵西隊勝此球後、如得奮興之劑、戰來愈見精彩、其左鋒又施其遠射之工夫、幸被陸鍾恩接而復落於地、陸急拾起、又被對方三前鋒來衝、幸陸運用其拍籃球絶技、得以化險爲夷、但巳險氣環生矣</p>
<p>可痛後二分鐘離完場前兩分鐘、陸鍾恩又被對方高球所誘、奔前迎之、西隊正前鋒飛奔加上一脚、遂奏奇功、東華雖努力反攻、但時不我與、直至戰幕低垂以二對二打成和局　　銀杯未知屬誰西班牙俱樂部、本備一大銀杯一座、以獎勵本日得勝者但旣成和局、則仍爲物主保存、再期於他日决賽之、</p>

<h3>救國禮劵</h3>
<p>— 舞霜</p>
<p>送禮，是人生的藝術，處世哲學上的開宗明義第一章。結婚，做壽，生子，要送禮，開吊，週年，落葬，也要送禮，上任，搬塲，討姨太太，開幕，也要送禮，端陽，中秋，年節，這是一年裏法定的「送禮節」。我們在大公司，機關團體裏辦事，送禮尤不勝負擔，眞使你精疲力盡，呌苦連天。而且，大多數，事不必問倛眞假有無，禮有不可不送之勢。畢竟中國人彬彬有禮，所以送禮這件事，盛行一時了。</p>
<p>除了特别情形以外，送禮劵最爲妙法，因爲銀行發行的禮劵，旣可兌現，又有利息，完全等於鈔票金錢。受禮的，未必個個楊裝第二；送禮的，也免得來暮夜苞苴，禮劵的效用如此，所以禮劵又風行一時了。</p>
<p>據說；南亦節約救國會特製紅素禮劵，分十元，八元，六元，四元，二元，一元，六種，委托某銀行經售；凡會員及一般的宴客送禮，都可以去買，卽把此項收入，移充救國之用；所以定名呌做「救國禮劵；」本來，我們的買航空建設獎劵，愛國獎劵，慈善香賓獎劵等等，雖然出於救國熱忱，未免帶了幾分發財的自利心，只有南京節約會的「救國禮劵」，性質完全在於救國，眞是一件美事。不過，送　的固然救國有心，竊恐受禮的，却之不恭，受之不　奈何！</p>
<p>在下聽到「救國禮劵」的消息，發生了一個感想，爲國家而發行禮劵，究竟不是一件好事。</p>
<p>何以呢？　如在滿淸時代，不是打不過英國，掣張「香港禮劵」送给他們吗？打不過日本，掣張「台灣禮劵」送給他們嗎？還有「朝鮮禮劵，」「琉球禮劵，」這是他們老實不客氣，在我們手中奪去的，並不是我們情情願願送他的禮品。到了目下，中華民國的禮劵，委實發行了不少，「　寗省禮劵」「吉林省禮劵」「黑龍江省禮劵，」這三張價值極鉅的禮劵，都從「不抵抗」三字奉送給日本人的。湯玉麟還以爲禮物太菲薄，再掣了一張「熱河禮劵」送给他們。豈知我們貴國的禮劵有限，而他们的野心無窮，我們袞袞諸公，正是快快預備禮劵吧！</p>
<h3>秋鬼語</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>獨埨車傍着汽車駛，帆船上的舵工引領瞧飛機響；所以失業工人在中國，好像並不多。到處只增加搶刦案而巳！</p>
<p>一位作家預備寫長篇小說，用農村經濟所以破産的材料爲背景但江西的友人說，不用閉門造車吧丨中國農村的眞實現相，是萬不能以江蘇浙江做標準的，就如拿四川的成都來比上海繁華一樣雖然說中國的民衆，已不像五四運動時候的淺薄低能，但五四的熱血曾　紅過趙家樓的碧草，而今縱使山海關外的白雪，也得算是「異國之」冬的點缀物了與其用梅花來象徴民族的氣骨，不如用鶯粟來象徴民族的智慧吧。你讀過德國名劇家ＦＲＩＥＤＲＩＣＨ　ＶＯＮ　ＳＣＨＩＬＬＥＴ的「强盜」，你會知道這譬喻</p>
<p>胡漢民先生給友人寫了一付曹全碑體格的楹聯：「在家憂國忠臣志」，「臨水登山壯士心」。這樣講，忠臣只要能憂國，憂國而必需在家，壯士只要能登山臨水，優游自娱，所以胡先生遯隠香港，算得忠臣，同時也是壯士！</p>
<p>要求投河自殺，會被警士救甦，要求出關殺敵，會被將軍擋駕：可知在這年頭兒果然容易被人殺，一旦想眞的死去，便有許多阻礙了。死的自由都没有，可笑得很丨</p>
<p>天那樣高，水那樣深，但高天會跌落進深水裏。所以偉人也有不可免的下野復興的國家要被滅亡，被滅亡的國家會復興，人都信認歷史。據此，中國必須亡，然後能復興！萝想復興者，那才是十足的亡國奴！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第八回憤語激靑年辟官　去</p>
<p>熱心憐少女挾　親來</p>
<p>甘太太眞不料他今天的態度，會强硬到這種樣子。紅着臉道好罷，等你哥哥回來，我這樣和他說就是了。說畢，他走開了。積之依然去收拾行李。果然，不到兩小時之久，厚之就回來了。厚之一國到上房，甘太太就迎着他喞喞咕咕說上了一陣大槪是把積之的話轉達了，因之上房裏也就一切寂然，並没有。聽到什麽聲息。積之走到院子裏來，對了上房的窗户喊道：嫂嫂，我走了。哥哥回來了，你可以證明一下，我並没有作什麽壞事吧？厚之在屋子裏，依然没有說什麽，却是甘太太由屋子裏走了出來，放出很和藹的樣子來道：二弟，你就不必走了，這話就這樣一說一了，明天你依然到局子裏去辦事。只要你下次不各你哥哥再閙蹩扭也就行了。積之冷笔道：下次嗎？我自巳也不能和我作那個保障。他說到此處也不再說了，自已到街上去啈好了兩輛人力車子，把舖蓋行李一陣風似的搬出了大門。甘家的男女僕人，没有主人翁的話，當然也不敢阑阻他，讓他從從容　容的走出了大門口，自已却走至對過大門裏來，各楊家母女辭行。恰　是這天下午。楊氏母女都出門口去了，他喊了一陣，驚動了後院裏的趙自强　。他一直的迎到大門口來，問道：哦丨是對道的街坊，找楊老太太有話說嗎？趙自强是個不留必的人，甘積之是個留心的人，他記得有一次在大門口遇到這個趙連長，曾證了他一眼，從此以後，桂枝就和自己喪失了感情，在這裏面，似乎趙連長有此作崇。（九一）</p>
<h3>後湖作汩羅</h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>南京的雨花臺是有名的勝蹟，同時也是著名的刑塲，燕子磯是風景最幽美的地方，同時也是輕生自殺者最多的場所。（雖則有人在燕子磯頭立牌示『死不得』作最後忠告；但决心沉江者依然不顧，仍不乏其人。）在鄕村裏，像這樣的地方，縱是名勝古蹟風景幽美，也早已使人疑神見鬼，或爲人跡罕到之區了。然而在都市裏却算不得什麽一回不，絲毫不稍受影響而略形减色。</p>
<p>因此，在端陽節的上午雖則有人效出願遣法，權把後湖作汩羅，頓時成爲新鬼。然而午後的游人，不獨不因此裹足不前，抑且更加絡繹不絶，倍形人山人海。本來，後湖（　玄武湖）自『紅了櫻桃緑了芭蕉』以後，早就每天都是士女如雲不過，照例上午的游人總比下午稀少。端陽節那一天，也不是例外。那投水的人，握着一個没人看見的機會，便由美洲附近的亭臺上縱身一跳，沉溺湖心。但喜遠處旣見有人自殺，忙即趕來呼衆撈救，爲時未逾十分鐘：然而撈上岸時。却巳　搏全停。氣息毫無了。這人不是會寫文章的屈原，然而却也不是凡人，據其遺書所說，與其所着的武裝大套看來。大槪不是冒充「前線歸」</p>
<p>來的壯士」。有人批評這壯士是「死得其時，却非其所」。其實在前線上有許多求馬革　屍而不得的壯士，又那得人人死得其所呢？</p>
<h3>從金剛石說到結婚</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>我以爲人生的結婚的幸與不幸，同金剛石的硬度，光澤，與强反光性，是牠的本礦的特徽；人生結婚的性情志趣與愛流貫注的融洽好感是人生結婚的基本條件。</p>
<p>金剛石的價値隨其色彩透明度與屈折力高低的本光澤及結晶之大小或重量而異；等於人們表現於社會貢　於人類的公益，事業的成績與發展量大小的成分及結果之大小或千古不磨的眞精神而估定人們結婚的價値</p>
<p>金剛石大槪是粉紅色的最貴，呈褐色灰色及黃色者最賤；人生結婚是飽滿的精神愉快的色澤和睦的活氣的最上，呈憂鬱的面孔呻吟的病聲，勃谿的氣象，過灰色的生活最下。</p>
<p>金剛石價格的增加與增大之倍數成平方比例；等於人們結婚後的兩性生活美滿的　大的互助諒的濃度與相親相愛的倍數成平方比例。</p>
<p>金剛石的小而不透明或稍微透明的鑽石屑，可供鑲鑽頭及裁切玻璃之用，又細碎的專用充琢磨粉；等於人們結婚的要素雙方或本身能力有缺陷或無立足社會的資格，只可代人役使兩相悖違，給崩潰的破産的社會做一個可憐蟲式的落伍家庭；在國的構成分數裏添一對怨偶</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>枝頭梅熟</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>這幾天斗室小坐，聽得街頭喚賣梅聲。想起了梅的形狀和味道，眞覺行流酸四濺，　涏欲滴。</p>
<p>梅子這東西，古人想必拿來代醋用的。所以尙書上有這樣兩句话「若作和　，爾　監梅」。</p>
<p>梅子靑的時候，酸而脆，可以做梅脯。此外還有幾種食法：以白糖溶化，塗在梅的四周，呌做白糖梅子。把梅子在鹽水内漬透，蘸以甘草末，呌甘草梅子。把梅子浸在蜜糖内，呌做蜜濺靑梅。</p>
<p>梅子黄熟、酸味略减、可以做梅醬。先把黄梅搗爛，略滲以鹽，以去苦味。然從和糖在　中煮透；有的不煮而用日曬，那却很費時日。梅醬中摻些玟瑰瓣，紫蘇，　芽，風味尤佳。女子喜食靑梅，孕婦尤嗜之。昔人有咏孕婦詞，中有幾句道：「終日貪眠作嘔，欲說又還　羞，含笑問　郎，梅子枝頭黃否？」何等藴藉，何等逼眞。</p>
<p>「黃梅時節家家雨」。這說黃梅時候是多雨的。「梅子黃時日日晴」。那却不對了！說天氣是很好的。到底是晴？是雨？我們從那一個好！幸虧有一個騎牆派诗人，把這段紛爭解開，說道：「熟梅時節半陰晴」。</p>
<p>栽梅須六年方結實。人圖近利，往往栽桃，因爲栽桃祇須三年。可是據冠生園主人洗冠生先生說：「因爲梅脯和陳皮梅的銷行，實覺得産梅的不夠。希望栽果園者，多種些梅樹，那纔不愁缺貨咧」！的確，現在市上的桃子很多，名式也很繁，因此價也跌了。而梅子呢，却不見有甚麽新花樣出來。希望人家多種些梅樹，花時像一片雪海；果時像倒翻醋　，眞是有味咧！</p>
<h3>魚鰣</h3>
<p>— 淸癯</p>
<p>鰣魚一樣東西，在初夏的當兒，要算是江鮮中貴品了。不過雖然一種魚類，也須辨他的出身是在那一處，　諸人徒有一個空名兒，必不能得到社會上的信用，若要比較靠得住，那末，就要去問他籍貫履歴，纔曉得不是隨便可以冒牌騙人的，吃鰣魚實在也不可以馬虎，就是這個道理。</p>
<p>鰣魚最出名的，自然産自浙江的富春江爲最著了，但是富春江以前有了一位嚴老先生的釣臺。被後來的一般詩人騒客去憑弔吟咏，　而在江水中活潑潑地的幾尾鮮魚，也就添了無限的光采，好像人一樣，出了著名的人物，就說「人傑地靈」，江水傍邊有了一座釣臺的名詞，（貴在釣臺現在還算什麽，簡直徒有空名，）就可以把這個榮譽移到　魚的身上，唉！從前的名人，吾不知道他的魔力，何以如此之大？其實從原理講，到底不是這個意思，鰣魚本身的價値，因爲他産生於淡水鹹水之間，所以比之海鮮和内河鮮，就大不相同了，故鰣魚不是富春江的特産，就蘇省而　，江陰的鰣魚，亦何嘗不負有盛名？</p>
<p>音邑市上的鰣魚，大半來自羅溪，而産自石洞的，其味最淸腴，也最精美，然而比之江陰的出品，像還趕不上，可見人的出身地是要緊，鰣魚也就這個原因。味的　劣，不在例外，前天聽見一個朋友講，「鰣魚的價錢眞貴啊？每一兩要賣小洋五分多，化了這重價，去買許多細骨來嚼，怎麽不習喉嚨裏　住呀？而且還要連鰣魚的鱗也統通一片一片呑下去，這豈不是怪事麽」？唉！吾不代鰣魚呌屈，而要代朋友可憐，宋朝時候，蘇東坡到蘇州，不識鰣魚，抱恨一生，鰣魚本不是常品，要嘗出他的滋味來，不是容易的的事，記得昔人有一首詩云，「春殘魚艇到江濱、網得鮮魚白似銀、世上但工皮相術，故敎異味在皮鱗」，可算代　魚鳴了個不平。</p>

<h3>文人</h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>我不是誇大狂，所以不說文人的天職是去做宰相而安天下，文人其實不過是一種盛世的點綴品而末　　　頭坯耳。</p>
<p>文人是頂勢利不過的，他們頂拿手的是頌揚咏讚，見着榮華富貴的地方，就會顯他們得意的身手。當太平盛世，正是文人歌功頌德的時候，也是他們可以亨福的時候，因爲天下富裕，的確可以豢養他們這一批寄生蟲。</p>
<p>但是到了亂世便不行了，他們的眼中，找不到可以讚美的對象，而贫困的社會，又没有多餘的糧食來畜養他們，於是他們的讚頌一變而爲咒駡。在根本上還是一樣的，他們的咒駡末世，即是頌仰盛世，而想做一個盛世的得意文人。不過社會上的對待他們却不同了，社會上的人總喜頌揚，而没有歡迎咀咒的，所以文人起來咒駡之後，文人便受處罰，結果槍决砍頭，都免不了，所以說他們是末世的殺頭坯。</p>
<p>但禍福無門，惟人自召，一時代的是盛世與末世，原來並無標準，大都是仁者見仁，智者見智，所以文人的願意得意或失意，也在他自己。倘使他認這時代爲末世而咒駡之，他就可以被殺頭，倘使他認這時代爲盛世而讚美之，他就可尊榮富貴。</p>
<p>因爲養育若干文人，究竟要不了多少資財，即使社會十分貧困，也還不在乎此，只要文人不去做鳥鴉和　梟社會總肯劃出一部分資財來豢養他們的　，那麽文人的自處如何，全是由他們自由意志的了，不過文人們究竟怎樣選擇呢？這我們有事實可看。</p>
<h3>立立</h3>
<p>— 衛濘</p>
<p>「立立，吻吻姊姊」。</p>
<p>一朶塗滿涎水的小嘴，軟軟地就在玲頰上啄了一下。</p>
<p>「再送個吻給姊姊吧，立立」丨玲逗着他說。「我抱你呢」。、</p>
<p>於是又面玲頰上軟軟的啄了一下次涎水幾乎淌到玲的頭頸。玲又說：「怪髒的！立立，給姊姊揩去┆┆」。</p>
<p>立立就把掛在他領上的手巾，在玲頰上抹抹。張着兩手說：「姊，抱！」</p>
<p>玲高興地笑着，把他抱起來。向空中舉了一舉，便把他放在地上亂闖，玲跟在後面。</p>
<p>一隻花白的小狸貓，「咪鳴┆┆」呌了一聲，從碗櫉上跳下來。白尾巴豎起，前爪向前平伸着，打了一個呵欠，也像立立似的在地上亂闖。</p>
<p>「打，打，┆┆」立立忽然瞅見小狸貓了，舉起小白拳頭喊，蹦着脚想趕┆┆。</p>
<p>「不要打，貓可憐的喲！」玲說。却依然讓他向前趕。</p>
<p>忽然，立立的帽子，從頭上歪到眼睛上。</p>
<p>「呃，呃，姊，帽，呃！」</p>
<p>「什麽喲」？玲故意問。</p>
<p>「呃。帽丨┆┆」立立把揑緊的拳頭放開，用一隻中指指着蓋在眼睛上的帽子。</p>
<p>玲格格地笑了，把他的帽子重新戴正。</p>
<p>這時，花白的小狸貓，闖到方桌下去了，立着身子又「咪鳴┆┆」呌了一聲。立立正在用小眼睛往四邊溜，聽見呌聲，就蹦着腿趕去，又舉起小白拳頭喊：</p>
<p>「打，打。┆┆┆」</p>
<p>可是，這小狸貓，膽子很大，非但不走，又很響地「咪鳴┆┆」呌了一聲。</p>
<p>立立趕到方桌脚邊站住，却不再喊「打，打」了，祇是獃着小眼珠發楞。</p>
<p>「怎的？打呀丨」玲鼓勵着。</p>
<p>立立不響。</p>
<p>「哈，立立怕了哩！」玲側着頭說。摇摇他的身子問：「可不是？」</p>
<p>「┆┆┆」</p>
<p>地，這花白的小狸貓，又呌了．並且呌得更響。颇有宣戰的意味。</p>
<p>「呃，呃，┆」立立嚇了，回過身子來。</p>
<p>「立立不怕！立立不怕！」玲說。「打，打，┆」</p>
<p>代立立舉起了小白拳頭。</p>
<p>「咪鳴，咪┆鳴！」貓厲害地呌着，好像在半夜同另一隻貓鬭爭的樣兒。</p>
<p>「哇┆」立立終於哭了。</p>
<h3>徐悲鴻爲劉海粟弟子考</h3>
<p>— 何典</p>
<p>細心的讀者總還没有忘記去年有曾某其人者在某雜誌發表一文，謂　家徐悲鴻爲劉海粟弟子，徐氏旋在滬上各報刋登啟事否認，而劉氏亦隨卽登報答辯，各執一詞，殊令局外人莫明其妙。頃得何黄先生寄來此文，考證精詳，有源有本，爰爲刋佈，藉釋　疑。編者</p>
<p>余謂悲鴻爲劉海粟弟子，信而有徴。或問：於何徴之？</p>
<p>余曰：第一，徴之於校。徐悲鴻嘗刋啓事，略謂民國初年，有甬人鳥某，在滬愛而近路，後遷橫浜路，設有圖畫美術院，蓋一純粹之野雞學校也。時吾年未二十。來自田間，誠　之愚，惑於廣告。茫然不知其詳，數月他去。鄙人於此野雞學校，固不認一切人爲師也。劉海粟亦刋啓事，略謂圖畫美術院，即美專前身，彼時鄙人年未弱冠，苦心經營。吾人就此二則啓事觀之。可知劉海粟　苦心經營圖畫美術院。徐悲鴻則嘗學於此數月，彼此皆自承認，即師生關係，亦無庸否認也。何况師生各刋啓事，尙有互相標榜之嫌乎？</p>
<p>第二，徴之於吹。劉海粟嘗自命爲中國文藝復興大師。且海粟之畫，旣入所謂世界名畫之集，則大師之名，不幾世界皆知也乎？徐悲鴻稱之曰『偉大哉牛皮』，誠哉是言也。然徐悲鴻實得海粟之衣鉢眞傳，故嘗作自傳一篇，自誇幼時畫馬，『雖古之韓無以過』；又自誇留學法國，彼邦藝術大師，如達仰，弗拉孟，倍南爾之流。『咸禮重之』；『。確係健者』。並自稱「中國藏歐洲名畫家作品之多。以悲鴻爲第一」；又自誇「其爲人堅苦卓絶」，所作中國畫「皆寓意深遠，氣勢偉大，於動物尤獨往獨來，前無古人」。此等牛皮，豈不偉大？非但不　於海粟，且有靑勝於藍之譽。　者谓中國幼穉之藝術界中有牛皮派，劉海粟倡之，其徒徐悲鴻繼之，豈不然耶？</p>
<p>第三，徴之於拍。海粟固嘗爲名公大人畫像矣，且嘗以自己作品，所謂不朽之畫徧赠名公大人邀譽矣。徐悲鴻深受乃師之薰陶，「其油繪有康南海，陳三立，吳稚暉，張溥泉，陳銘樞，李濟琛等諸人像」，寫入自傳，用爲誇耀，幾不知拍馬爲不甚榮譽之事。「其師殺人，其徒必且行刦」。以海粟之大師，宜得悲鴻之高足也。</p>
<p>第四，徴之於叛。海粟嘗自命爲「藝術叛徒」矣，其徒徐悲鴻至不承認彼爲其師，可谓叛徒之叛徒。海粟當掀其短髭笑曰：吾之吹拍藝術，已得替人矣。而悲鴻亦能「當叛不讓於師」，他日改作自傳，不妨更以藝術叛徒惟一有出息之眞傳弟子自誇也。</p>

<p>二，徐之自傳見讀書雜志。</p>

<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— ＪＵＬＥＳ　ＫＥＮＸＲＯ作林取譯</p>
<p>羊（續）</p>
<p>當小羊們饕餮地吃着奶時，腰上常被小羊的鼻子突然碰着的母羊，却平靜地，若無其事地在吃着草料。紅蘿蔔鬚瞧見食槽的水裏擱着一些鐵鐽的碎片，釘在車輪上的鐵圈，和一把用過的鏟子。</p>
<p>「你的水槽眞乾凈呀！」他狠俏皮的說。「你一定是用着這些鐵屑使你的牲口有更多的血液」</p>
<p>罷！」</p>
<p>「一點不錯，」巴酌耳說。「你也會相信那些話啦，你！」</p>
<p>他要紅蘿　鬚把水嘗嘗看。爲着使水更加有益於身體的緣故，他把不論什麽東西都丢在裏面。</p>
<p>「你要我給你一個小玩意嗎！」他說</p>
<p>「那當然要領情啦，」紅蘿蔔鬚並不知道他要給他什麽，却先道謝了。</p>
<p>巴酌耳在一頭母羊的　鬆的毛裏搜索着，用指甲揑住了一個圓圓的，肥碩的，吃得狠飽的，黃色的寄生虫。據巴酌耳說，只要有兩個這樣大的寄生虫，便可以把一個小孩的頭像吃李子一樣吃掉。他把這東西放在紅蘿蔔鬚的手心裏，對他說，如果他想尋開心的話，可以把這東西帶回去塞在他哥哥或姐姐的頭上或頭髮裏面。</p>
<p>那寄生蟲已經開始工作了牠向皮　進攻。紅蘿蔔鬚覺得手指上有什麽東西啄着，好像被一些小雹打聲着一樣。這種感覺一會兒便傳到手腕上，更進而傳到肘臂上了。他覺得那寄生蟲正在繁殖起來，要把他整個手臂通通　掉似的。</p>
<p>不管他，紅蘿蔔鬚把牠捻住了：他把牠揑碎，再將自己的手在一匹母羊前上揩乾凈了，全没有讓巴酌耳看見。</p>
<p>如果他問起來，他會回說遺失了。</p>
<p>又過了一會，紅蘿蔔鬚凝神靜氣地聽着，那些　　的呌聲渐漸靜下去了。突然，人們祇聽到　碎的　秣在羊嘴裏被細嚼着的聲音。</p>
<p>一件舊了的羊毛披風掛在食槽的橫木上，好像獨自在看守着羊羣似的。</p>
<p>敎父</p>
<p>雷辟克家的間常允許紅蘿蔔鬚去看他的敎父，或甚至睡在他那兒。這是一個陰鬱的孤獨的老頭子，他以釣魚和種植葡萄爲生。他不喜歡任何人，他祇不討　紅蘿舊鬚</p>
<p>「你來啦，畜生！」他說。</p>
<p>「是啦，敎父，」紅蘿蔔鬚說，並不抱吻他，「你給我把釣竿預備好了嗎？」</p>
<p>「我們兩個人有一支鈎竿就夠了。」敎父說。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚把倉屋的門推開一看，他的钩竿早已預備好了。他的敎父常是這樣逗他的，但和他稔熟了的紅蘿蔔鬚已不再生氣了，老頭子這種舉動還差不多使得他　的交情更加圓滿呢。</p>
<p>當他說「是」的時候。其實是說「不是」的，而這一方面也是一樣的。這祇要彼此不　錯就行「如果這事使得他開心的話，這在我是毫没有關係的，」紅蘿蔔鬚心裏想。</p>
<p>於是他們始終是好朋友。</p>
<p>平常每星期祇燒一次菜的敎父，因爲欵待紅蘿蔔鬚的緣故，把一大鍋　豆和一大塊肥肉放在火上煮着，在出門之前，他强迫紅蘿蔔鬚喝了一杯没有滲水的葡萄酒。</p>
<p>隨後他們便去釣魚。</p>
<p>敎父坐在水邊上狠内行地把那佛洛　斯産的長　展開來。他用幾片沉重的石塊把兩支動人的大釣竿壓住，他是祇釣大魚的，釣着了的時候他便連忙用布包着，好像用襁褓包住婴孩一樣（未完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>哀胡立夫之死</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>有許多人死得不明不白，有許多人却死得明明白白，而不明不白的時代早已過去。現在是國法森嚴，賞罰不苟。亽是乎胡傖立夫遂於三日下午一時三十分登上斷頭台，身殉國法了，</p>
<p>關於此公之死，凡是熱心愛國的同志們，一想起一二八戰事的當時，此公膽敢「爲虎作倀」，「賣國媚敵」，現在只落得没有下塲，不免是萬民稱快，然而只有胡氏自己知道，這次的死，的確是含寃莫伸，所以在臨刑之前，不覺悲從中來，流涙不止，繼而摇頭百太息曰，「賣去了田地，救濟難民，現在竟得如此結果，眞是暗無天日，還有什麽話說？，叭有到陰曹去告狀」。這樣說來凡是對胡公頗具間情者，到底要懷疑淸天白日的大老爺還不夠「靑天」。</p>
<p>於是可知，天下的事，眞有不能盡如人意者，罪大恶極如胡立夫，也要說含寃莫白，那末小而至於一二八當時的所謂「江北漠奸」之流，不知殺了多少，不是都要有寃無處伸，在陰曹地府，不是連閻羅寳殿都要閙翻了嗎？，假如眞是如此，寃鬼們只有在地府中才有昭白之日，於是乎使我們懷疑到只有十八層地獄才有靑天大老爺，而人間的法律，也就不及地府來得公平，人間的法庭，也就比閻羅殿差得多了。</p>
<p>然而這終於是無稽之談，不甚可靠，賞罚分明如現行法律者，到底是「大道之行也天下爲公」，何况竊鈎者誅，竊國者侯，早已成爲金科玉律，所以胡立夫，畢竟該死，該死，該死，</p>
<p>文藝</p>
<h3>感時</h3>
<p>— 金質</p>
<p>獨據西南不幾年，昨窗飛電又紛傳，夙懹驥　三生志，老怕狼烽四起烟，望魯空暛無斧柄，避秦何處覓漁船，焚香願效明宗祝，早降精靈障百川。</p>
<p>丨丨丨丨丨丨</p>
<p>平生幾見月當頭，斗酒也應與人謀，憶舊舉杯詩自得，離披到處恨難休，或名碌碌羅照諫，文譽翩翩秦少游，極目河山兵甲滿，有誰能解倒懸憂，</p>
<h3>忍耐性</h3>
<p>— 其然</p>
<p>「有忍耐性的人，是很好的；没忍耐性的人是很壞的。」自上古直到現在，一般聖賢人，都是這樣敎訓人。</p>
<p>於是：富貴人，可算很好，這就因爲有忍耐性：貧賤人，可算很壞，這就因爲没忍耐性。同樣的道理，愈富貴的人，忍耐性就愈强：愈貧賤的人，忍耐性就愈弱。所以，富貴人能爲富貴人，貧賤人被做貧賤人，就是這個道理。若說不信，有事爲證：丨</p>
<p>在下等影戲院裏，不過將到應該開映的時間，這些下等觀衆，就吹嘯的吹嘯，鼓掌的鼓掌，怪呌的怪呌，放紙箭的放紙箭，這種舉動，總不外是催戲院快些開映的表示。在中等影戲院裏，恰到或稍過了些應該開映的時間，這些中等觀衆，一部分是靜蕭蕭地等候着，一部分也在着吹嘯，鼓掌，放紙箭，可是，多是小陔子和着破衣服的人。在上等影戲院裏，不說是在没有到應該開映的時間，大家不會喧嘩，就是過了些應該開映的時間，還没開映，這些上等觀衆，還是靜靜地在坐着等，絶不有鼙鼓掌和吹嘯等樣舉動。這種就是富貴人和貧賤人底忍耐性的差别。也可說是「好人」和「壞人」的忍耐性的不同。</p>
<p>這點證據，還似不夠，所以再引點大的來說：</p>
<p>日本人來侵我們國家。國人對於這件事情，就有種種不同的主張：要人，偉人和聞人們，有主纼不抵抗的，有主張無限期抵抗的，有主張待過五六年後，日本會被地震消滅的，有主張等候五十年後，我們國家就會强盛起來的。這些主張，總不外是富貴人的忍耐性。也可說是「好人」的忍耐性。可是，一般平民，一般勞苦大衆，就主張盡力抵工抗，武力收復失地，向日本絶交和宣戰。這個一反富貴人的主張的主張，就是貧賤人的没忍耐性。也可說是「壞人」的没忍耐性。</p>
<p>至於，這兩種主張，究竟是那種對，依以上的道理，當然是富貴人的主張對。但是，富貴人們的主張，又有數種不同，那末，究竟又是那一種對，這個，也應依以上的道理，當然是最富貴的人底主張對。這是因爲他的忍耐性也最强。</p>
<h3>女性的魔力</h3>
<p>— 志欽</p>
<p>女性的魔力眞偉大，她的一舉一動能左右男子的快樂和痛苦，一個美麗的摩登婦女到處右以吸引異性追逐，能夠造成許多男子的自殺或猛力的　爭，她的魔力右以造成世界文明，同時亦足以搗亂社會紀綱，就上海一隅而言，各游藝塲的女招待能夠招引許多的狂蜂浪蝶的游客來造成營業興旺，商號的女職員，能夠拉攏顧客替老　發財，會議塲中，的女招待，能鼓起與會人興趣與精神。</p>
<p>目今的世界好似在處均有無女不成事之有無心肝？！</p>
<p>要的得</p>
<p>十九國報，延年益壽　惜字紙</p>
<p>慨。</p>
<p>女性的魔力可以說是造成現今世界文化的一種熱力，假使女性没有魔力世界决無如此文明，傷風敗俗的事情也决不至於閙得如此之多，如故南京路上没有摩登婦女的芳蹝，包管你冷落得像南市的陸家浜馬路一樣推銷舶來品的各大公司，就還呈着門可羅雀的不景氣現象哩。</p>
<p>跨進了没有女性參與其間的辦公室。必定靜寂得聲息毫無各個男子的面上，都還呈着萎靡不振精神頽廢的氣慨，滿室散佈着一陣一陣不可思議的臭味，假使有了美麗花瓶點綴其間，要是你登堂入室，就還有各種莫名其妙的香味輸進你的鼻子，而同室男子的修飾和衣服個個漂亮得像新官人一樣，精神　發，辦公竸爭，偉大哉女性之魔力呵！</p>
<h3>生命的燈</h3>
<p>— 佩</p>
<p>厭倦的情緒籠罩着我整個的心靈。灰色的輪廓巳鮮明地露出一幅歇尸的里患者的圖形，脈博是減少了吧？體温是降低了吧？啊！丨這分明是「壽終正寢」的前施，怎的，怎的啊。這種厄運，先進襲到我這靑年的心靈丨</p>
<p>誰說黑雲密佈的天空，是暴風雨將來的前宵？誰說母體的陣痛，是新生命將要誔生的預兆，誰又說呀，煩悶之神這顆厭倦的心靈，怎的麻醉到而今，而今呵，都求甦醒丨</p>
<p>我整天整夜的在想，在想我生命的沉淪：「與其腐朽，無寗砍折」不是你最近過去生活的縮影，不是你過去積極精神的表微？曾幾何時，時間便呑没了這種戰士的精神。於是頽廢的鬼，又悄悄地，悄悄地爬進到我這，這顆遊夷的心門！</p>
<p>在孤燈相伴着的靜夜，面荒徑中獨自躑躅的黃昏。這時夜的沉默摧眠了人間的揎攘，路徑的崎嶇阻住了　寰的恶臭，我這顆久受束縛的心也獲得片時的解脫，在解脫裏，一切我都驚悟了，彷彿有一道白光在漆黑纍纍的荒塜中，往來跳躍，由白熱色而深赤，而淡绿，而灰暗，終於同異暗擁抱在一起。</p>
<p>一切我都驚悟了，在沙漠中容不下甘泉，在荆叢中容不下鮮艶的玫瑰；在一堆平風，冥頑，嫉妬，薄情；┆┆的荒塜中，又怎能容下光的活躍！</p>
<p>是的，我很了然，我這盞生命的燈，也被我周遭的敵人環攻得奄奄一息了，但我坦然，我不怯弱。我的賜予，只是食有敵意的冷笑，不是投降求生的眼涙。我不暇再爲我的生命嘆息，嘆息所獲得的酬報，只有助長敵人的氣焰，也許時候到了，我將由冷笑一變而至肉博。</p>
<p>我以爲這樣的態度去應付我的敵人！冷笑，肉博。我以這樣的態度生存*</p>
<p>勞，壽終，假若在生之戰塲上不夭折，不是小卒的話。</p>
<h3>如意算盤</h3>
<p>— 愼敏</p>

<p>國府命令，還要嚴厲，如果與他計較，馬上要下逐客之令，但是要求安居，只能妥洽了事，雖然百物日漸昻貴，房租不能例外，可蝸居的地點，市面冷落，交通又不便利，對於分租，殊屬困難，門首的鮮紅召租，四季常貼，廂房剛剛租出，亭子間又告喬遷。客堂樓無人顧　，三層擱更難召租，搬來搬去，旣然忙的不亦樂乎，房客時常大起交涉，劈拍麻雀聲，大哭小喊聲，表子俉「讀恒」子聲，喜匹柴弄聲，擾擾攘攘，喧喧譁譁，不絶於耳，寗波人打話眞正犯關來　，而且東家欠房租，西家闹失業，二房東臨到了這種光景，豈不是霉頭要觸到印度國呢。</p>

<h3>五姫的一生（二十五）（續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>二十三，燕窝湯</p>
<p>又過了好些時候，一切的事都進行得非常順利。五夫人蹣着蘇部長和張少爺度着幸福的光陰固不必說，就是張少爺仍然和荷香偷偷摸摸，五夫人也不會知道，而且武貴兄新近又多買了兩隻鵪鶉，也覺得十分淸閒自在。總而言之，五夫的公館裏充滿了可愛的和平。</p>
<p>這一天，又到了吃午飯的時候，荷香到房裏來請了兩次，可是五夫總懶懶的躺在床上不願意起來。其後總還是荷香出了主意，索興將午飯開到房裏來。就在床面前擺上一個小桌子。當然張少爺也得在床沿邊坐下陪着她吃。不過雖然如此，五夫人仍然是看着飯就討厭。什麽菜都吃腻了，尤其是那碗蹄花和淸墩鷄更使她覺得頭痛。祇有那一碗燕窝湯到是比較可口的，張少爺很能夠了解她的脾胃，於是淘了許多湯在自己碗裏，淸淸的泛着幾粒飯，委細膩的凑近她一箸一箸的　着她。於是五夫人覺得舒服了，也雁着輕輕的ＫＩＳＳ。可是當荷香進來預備洗臉水的時候，親眼看着張少爺如此這般，却不免眼睛冒火氣忿忿的跑出去了。可是張少爺到底聰明，馬上捧着碗一面喊着荷香一机追出去，和餵五夫人一樣的照樣的餵了這丫頭幾口。還添了一個親吻，可是同時也巧妙的大聲說，有意的使五夫人可以聽見：</p>
<p>「你馬上去給我預備乾凈襯衫和襪子，吃過飯就要穿着出去的。」</p>
<p>當然荷香也得嘴裏含着飯小心的答應：</p>
<p>「知道了。」</p>
<p>走回房裏，張少爺笑笑的對着五夫人看了一眼，馬上又將飯碗凑近她的嘴唇。</p>
<p>吃過午飯以後，他們抽了幾筒鴉片，聊以助長精神，照例的又坐着汽車出去了。汽車上的玻璃窗户都垂下了絨布和外面隔絶了。五夫人熱情的將腦袋埋在他的胸前，說：</p>
<p>「我們到底打算到那裏去呢？」</p>
<p>「咦？你剛才不是說要到賭博場裏去翻本嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，那兒還有什麽味兒呢？」</p>
<p>「那末今天下午怎麽過呢？梅老　來了，還是聽他的覇王别姬去罷。」</p>
<p>「不，也聽厭了，還不是那樣妞妞娓娓的一套，有什麽新花樣兒？」</p>
<p>最後還是汽車夫代爲主意，到魯意思拍賣塲去買幾件古董到是滿有趣兒的。但是帶一尊玉觀音回來的。張少爺覺得有到臺灣銀行拿幾百元現欵回來零用的必要，於是汽車又折回外灘。到了，她挽着他的胛　艱難的走上石階。剛剛走進大門恰好顧經　　迎而走來。張　　不免　　一紅，可是五夫人　　分大方走上前和他拉了一下手，嬌親切的說：</p>

<h3>島格與瓊的愛情復活</h3>
<p>— 引西</p>
<p>小范朋克誓願恢復舊日情愛</p>
<p>克勞馥對於他亦念念不忘</p>
<p>這事是有趣到極點。恐怕是因爲他們在銀幕表演慣了，所以在日常生活上，亦要來如法泡製一下，但是這並不是絶對不可能的。島格拉斯小范朋克現在巳開始工作了，向他離異的妻重新求愛的工作。他說「我應當效法歐洲的男子，因爲歐洲的男子，在結婚之後，仍舊日日向妻求愛的。」他又說「凡一件東西値得要的，就値得爲牠而奮鬭。我從前曾爲瓊而奮鬭，我現又要爲她奮鬭了。」</p>
<p>自從小范朋克與瓊克勞馥宣告脫輻（分居而不離婚）之後，島格就向新聞記者宣稱「我必重向我妻求愛。我將要送花给她，送糖果，送一切的禮物。如同我們結婚以前的一樣。我還要天天打電話給也，電話不通的地方，則打電報給她。」現在小范朋克很後悔不應該說這許多話，他應當一步一步地做去。他說「不過這許多話，是我心中突然的感觸，不假思索　發的話。我們的分離，來得太快了。我但覺腦筋中一陣迷惘，心中不知道是什麽滋味，但覺得我一定要設法　她回來。我要她。我愛她。我不能缺少她。」</p>
<p>小范朋克自己承認作差了一件事。他說他在結婚後兩年之中，祇知道做丈夫，而不知道同時還要做甜心。許許多多美國的丈夫都因此失敗了，我亦是其中之一。我以爲結婚是一樁極自然極便當的事。我雖有時候買些花給她，我總覺得那是些没有很大意識的舉動。不知不覺之间，我就不大顧到我的妻子，我現在但願瓊能了解我的缺憾，使我重新有一個機會表示我愛她的眞誠。」</p>
<p>現在有一個値得研究的問題：「未得愛而求愛容易呢？還是已經失愛而再求愛容易？」普通的解答大槪係「未得愛而求愛容易些，已失愛而再求愛，有似覆水重收，夠確是極不容易的。」但是小范朋克說他與瓊人雖分離，情硿未曾割斷，他們還是互相變愛著，所以頗有破鏡重圓的希望。再則還有一件可以帮小范的忙的，就是他對於瓊的嗜好，厭惡，至少比别人明白些。「她喜歡什麽花，什麽香水。什麽糖，她要去的什麽戲院，她的脾氣，誰能像我知道得淸楚。但我並不拒絶别位男子的竸爭。誰能拿瓊搶去的，儘管搶去，因爲我自信她不至被别人搶去的」！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「桃花運」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>ＳＡＩＬＯＲＳ　ＬＵＣＫ</p>
<p>劇情熱閙導演甚佳</p>
<p>當我從南京戲院回來，我的記憶中還留着ＳＡＩＬＯＲ胡閙的印象。關於外國的水兵們，我們眞是看夠了他們的威風。他們載歌載唱的在黃包車上大發酒瘋，在街上橫衝直撞，打黃包車夫，闹酒排間，諸如此類，不勝屈指。</p>
<p>看罷，在這「桃花運」中，便是美國水兵們生活的素描。他們蜂擁上岸，搶小贩的香蕉，見着女人便胡調。閙游泳池，打跳舞塲，當然這不僅是戲劇而巳，而是他們實際生活的暴露。然而編劇者並不以此爲醜惡，而是要以他們浪漫而野蠻的行動增進電影工業的生産，所以便　取了這一題材而結構成熱閙的劇情了。</p>
<p>正因爲如此，於是導演便聰明的使整個的演出都非常活潑。可以說，自首至尾都没有沉悶的塲面，特别是開始的幾塲更見精采。許多滑稽的穿插都很自然，除了那醉漢的動作比較的胡閙以外。至於「肉感」的條件也是做到了的，那游泳池中成羣的女人，那女主角在公寓中半裸的遮遮掩掩，這些都不像其他影片中那般肉麻，甚至於最後的一塲「打出手，」也不敎人討厭。總之，導演的手法，的確是十分高明，而羅爾華爾許（ＲＡＯＵＬ　ＷＡＬＳＨ）先生也就會來這一套。男女主角吉姆斯頓（ＪＡＭＥＳ　ＳＵＮＮ）和莎麗愛　絲（ＳＡＬＬＹ　ＥＩＬＥＲＳ）的表演，我們是領敎過好幾次的，愛　絲在這裏比「賽珍會」中更好，而他們兩人合演的「體貼入微」也比這個差得多。肯定的說，那末吉姆斯頓出演活潑的豆劇確是非常適宜的。其他幾個重要配角，都還稱職，只有那個飾公寓主人的却不能討人歡喜。</p>
<p>關於攝影，那末這裏又多了一種換景的花樣。雖然導演不愛用Ｃ．Ｕ．但是很我的ＳＣ都很精采。</p>
<p>然而本片有一個大缺點，便是故事過於「巧合，」我不相信無論在什麽地方，這一對有情人都能夠不約而同的聚合。</p>
<p>附帶的說一句，新聞片中有着五個世界巨頭的特寫（Ｃ．Ｕ），每一個巨頭都會博得一部份外國觀衆興高彩烈的鼓掌，而反對者却報以「嘘嘘」之聲。原來人們對於「偉人」的信仰畢竟是如此的不同。</p>
<h3>評「畫舫情痕」ＣＡＲＮＩＶＡＬ　ＢＯＡＴ</h3>
<p>— 頑石</p>
<p>當我們對於「武俠」「愛情」或是「　片」看得厭倦了的時候，我們常希望有一部「力」的表現的影片在電影市場中發現。這種作品，對於我們多少可以調劑一下。而這然種作品除了在（ＴＨＥ　ＲＯＡＤＴＯ，ＬＩＦＥ）中我們曾經得滿足以外，大多數的歐美影片是不會在「　綿悱惕」「哀咸頑艶」┆┆等範圍之外而敎我們十分興奮的。那末這張百代公司的「畫舫情痕」，却多少是别開生面的，在　個的畫面上都畫着粗大的線條，雖然這一作品並没有眞實的生命，但是許多强壯的男人，粗暴的行動，大聲的嘩笑，以及火車的奔馳，起重機的雷鳴，斧刀的砍伐樹木聲，锯木聲，都使這一部作品有着特殊的「力」的成績</p>
<p>但是導演並不曾放棄女人的大腿和美女的柔情，好像是没有這些温輜的感觸給與觀衆，便不能成爲影片似的。不過這些也不敎人何等肉麻，也不是劇中的主要的部份，而且這種穿插也並不破壞劇情，所以本片好的部份仍然存在。至於本片的内容，並不如廣告上所說的「武俠」，而是描寫父與子的新舊的衝突，理智與感情的矛盾也可以說便是倫理」的作品。正因爲如此，我們可看出本片的作者，目的在乎解釋事業和愛情的不能平稀，然而又是不可缺一，於是那個年靑的兒子終於在事業的疲勞之下，而得着愛情的安慰了。</p>
<p>攝影是非常好的，有幾個黑暗的場面更見生動。在這裏可看出光線有着好的配置，眞使畫面達於盡善盡美的　地。然而導演對於鏡頭方面，可惜平凡了一點。同時有些笑料亦嫌重複。</p>
<p>至於表演，那末每一個重要角色都很適當。尤其是那個飾兒子的更且精采，當他在火車上怱忙的跳越，憑着起重機上升或下埀，在水閘下安置炸藥，以及最後的一場惡戰，都顯出他健康的體格，强壯的雄姿。女角當自情人家裏出來失望而落涙的時候，雖然是短短的一個鏡頭，也是很能夠動人情感的。</p>
<p>所以，我們看過本片之後，决不會覺着失望，雖然也並不就此滿足。</p>
<h3>談談三大公司的三隻玲瓏小鳥</h3>
<p>— 喻家卿</p>
<p>陳燕燕她是北平人，說到藝術的表演，三人之中，要算她最佳。她有深刻的表情，純潔的心靈，她的胸腔懷着滿腹的熱情，毅力，壯志，與偉大的志願，她是時代女性的典型。她的未婚夫是聯華第一廠的攝影師王紹芬。她善飾女學生一類的悲角，凡是看過「南國之春」，「三個摩登女性」，「奮鬥」與「除夕」没有不稱贊道好的不使人滿意。她的未來的出品是「母性之光」。</p>
<p>袁美雲她是杭州人，說到年齡，三人之中，要算她最小，她富於藝術的天性，她像西子湖一般的淸　秀氣，她有天眞的表演，靈活的身體，水晶般的眼睛，她能唱動人聽的京劇，也能說一口流利淸詭的國語。看過「游藝大會」與「小女伶」的觀衆，没有一個不拍手呌好的，她未來的出品是「生機」，「孝道」與「小妹妹」。</p>
<p>顧蘭君她是揚州人，但是她不常說「這塊」與「唔家」這一類話的。說到容貎，三人之中，她是最美麗的。她有嬌態的表情，活潑的身體，高尙的思想，純潔的志向，她玲瓏得可愛。她的前程是光明平坦的。在「女性的呐喊」與「前程」裏的動作，巳有相當特殊的成功，可惜她處於配角的地位，但是不久的將來，她是一顆一九三三年的亮星，燦爛光榮，一定有許多驚人的藝術，貢獻給我們。</p>

<h3>女性之光ＭＡＥＤＣＨＥＮ　ＩＮ　ＵＮＩＦＯＲＭ㈠</h3>
<p>— 欣俯</p>
<p>目耳曼影片公司出品</p>
<p>全班女演員聯合主演</p>
<p>這部片子，是集合了德國幾位電影界鉅子的思想和經濟力量而成的作品。工作人員，係採用消費合作方法，槪不給薪；‘但是換句話說，上自監製，下至配角，大家都是股東。演員都是女性，導演編劇，亦由女子担任。下面所述，就是本片的情節在那古色古香的德意志故都中，矗立着一座高入雲霄，十八世紀宫殿式的建築物。一陣陣如訴如慕的鐘聲，在忽斷忽續的隨風　蕩着。那没有帳幔的窗子，是黑暗得不成樣子了：那準了石灰水的迴廊，呈　着萬分悽凉的狀態；還有那門前的白石階級，更峻峭得呌人駭怕。裏面的空氣，是十二分的森嚴和冷酷。如果不是那　　燕燕的弦歌聲，一陣陣括進了你的耳鼓，也許你要當它是一座兵營，或是一所古廟，决不會想到這是一所女子學府。丨一所在德國敎育界佔有極大勢力的女子府！不幸的是曼尼拉，她的母親早就去世了！父親又是一個軍人，對於女兒的事情，是不大明暸和過問　。曼尼拉長到了十四歲，她的姑母，就把這樣一個活潑天眞的姑娘，送到那樣一所　氣深沉的學校裏去讀書。她一脚踏進了校門，就感覺到失望；等到看見那師長的冷酷面孔更覺不安起來，她竟忍不住哭起來了。「你哭什麽？一個軍人的女兒好哭嗎？快去換上制服吧」！一個師長，扳起了面孔這樣對她說。</p>
<p>她！她還敢開口嗎？祇得默默無辭，含着涙兒　出門外，　悠悠的走上樓去。這時後面忽然有一位女僕呼喊着：「姑娘，你不能打那條路走」！她祇好回轉身來，跟着女僕所指示的途徑走去，但是心裏一直懷疑着：「難道走路也要受干涉嗎」她這樣胡思亂想着，一會兒又到了那「化裝室」了。於是她那美麗的　　，頓時被束成一根滑稽可笑的髮　；再把日常所穿的衣服脫掉，換上了黑色和黃色條紋的制服。這時她忽然在制服的衣襟上，發現着一點東西。不覺很驚奇的喊起來道，「什麽？這上面　着一顆鷄心和ＦＶＢ	三個字母呢」！那庶務員望了一望。笑着說：「哦！這件衣服，從前是屬於一位迷戀　柏女士的姑娘的呀」！</p>

<h3>New Sino-American Loan Established</h3>
<p>$50 Million US to Purchase Agricultural Products</p>
<p>Annual Interest at 5%, Principal Repaid in Three Years</p>
<p>Finance Minister Song Has Signed in the US</p>
<p>Washington – The US Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) has agreed to loan the Chinese government $50 million US to purchase American cotton and wheat. This agreement has been signed by Song Ziwen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of China, and the General Manager of the RFC. The loan bears an interest rate of 5% and is to be repaid in three years. Four-fifths of the loan will be used to purchase cotton, and one-fifth to purchase wheat and flour, all of which will be freely purchased by Chinese representatives in the American market in installments. To the extent possible, all goods will be transported by American ships. RFC General Manager Jones declared that this loan was approved by President Roosevelt before it was finalized. Negotiations regarding this matter began last year when wheat producers in the northwestern United States proposed that the RFC loan money to China to purchase millions of bushels of wheat. However, due to certain liability issues that could not be resolved, the proposal was temporarily abandoned. The current agreement is based on the amount of American cotton and wheat that China purchases, which determines the loan amount. According to sources within the RFC, based on current market prices, China can absorb over 900,000 bales of American cotton and approximately 12.25 million bushels of American wheat. A public statement released by the RFC stated that it is believed that this loan is beneficial to both parties. It can promote the sale of surplus goods in the American market and encourage Chinese people to use American cotton and wheat, thereby revitalizing the Chinese economy, which will be beneficial to the recovery of the world economy. It is reported that the freight from American ports of export will be borne by China, as well as other miscellaneous expenses. According to the agreement, although China should make free purchases of cotton and wheat in the American market within a six-month period, the RFC also has the right to purchase goods stored by the Federal Farm Board and resell them to China at fair value. (Havas Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Washington – The $50 million US loan from the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation to China is only the second loan the corporation has granted to a foreign country. This loan will be used by China to purchase agricultural products in the United States, mainly cotton. The terms are considered favorable here: the purchased goods will serve as collateral before delivery, and after delivery, designated consolidated taxes in China will serve as collateral, including taxes on cigarettes, flour, cotton yarn, and matches. The Chinese government has agreed to repay the principal and interest in installments within three years. In 1932, these tax revenues amounted to $22 million US, sufficient to cover debt repayment. The Chinese government can immediately draw upon this loan, but the purchased goods must be ordered from American businesses and, to the extent possible, transported by American ships. The shipping schedule will be determined by China. It is only stipulated that 10% of the goods' value be paid from the loan upon shipment from the warehouse, followed by another 15% within 90 days, with the remaining amount repaid in installments over three years. If payment is delayed, interest will be charged at 5%. Therefore, this loan is essentially a temporary advance of payment for goods. (Guomin Dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>Nanjing – Regarding the US loan, the Ministry of Finance made the following statement today: When Minister of Finance Song Ziwen discussed economic issues with the US President in Washington, he negotiated a $50 million US loan with the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation. This loan will be used to purchase American cotton and wheat for import into China (with approximately four-fifths for cotton and one-fifth for wheat and flour). This move is beneficial to both the American and Chinese people. Leaving aside the benefits for the United States, it can also greatly benefit the Chinese government by allowing it to provide cotton and wheat on credit to the domestic market, thereby alleviating the cotton and wheat shortages. (Guomin Dispatch, 5th)</p>
<p>Washington – Regarding the impact on American commerce of the US Reconstruction Finance Corporation's loan of $50 million US to China to purchase American cotton and wheat, government officials are unwilling to comment publicly. However, the Department of Agriculture is quite pleased, stating that the result of China's recent purchase of large quantities of American cotton and wheat is clearly visible, especially in the cotton market, as China can purchase no less than 940,000 bales. Mr. Peek, who is responsible for monitoring the implementation of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, declared yesterday that the United States has 13 million bales of cotton in storage as of July 1st, and the total wheat inventory as of July 1st is the same as last year, namely 360 million bushels. China can only purchase 12 million bushels. Officials in the Department of Agriculture believe that although China is purchasing American cotton and wheat, the special tax levied under the Agricultural Adjustment Act to restrict wheat production cannot be waived. Some also believe that cotton producers have developed various hopes since the promulgation of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, which will result in an increase of millions of bales in cotton production, thereby completely offsetting the beneficial effects of China's purchase of American cotton.

<h3>Japanese Army Withdraws Partially</h3>
<p>Supply Units and Heavy Artillery Withdrawn First</p>
<p>Puppet Troops Under Li and Zhao Reorganized by Our Side</p>
<p>Beijing – The most important issue following the signing of the ceasefire agreement in Beiping, which has been the focus of attention in recent days, is the withdrawal of the Japanese army from the Great Wall line and the disposition of the puppet troops in the Eastern Front. According to the agreement, when our troops withdraw to the locations specified in the first item, the Japanese army will automatically retreat and gather along the Great Wall line. Now that our troops have fulfilled the agreement, the Japanese side will find it difficult to break its promise. When Xiong Bin met with Okamura in Tianjin on the evening of the 2nd, Okamura clearly stated that he could issue an order to begin withdrawing troops as soon as he returned to Changchun, and that the supply and artillery units in the rear could be moved first, followed by the formal withdrawal of infantry and cavalry units in the front. According to reports on the 5th, some Japanese troops have already withdrawn from the Jue Tai, Baodi, and Yutian areas. Okamura took the Japanese ship Tianjin Maru to Dalian on the 3rd, and it is estimated that he will arrive in Changchun on the 5th. Based on this observation, there should be no problems with the Japanese army's withdrawal. As for the disposition of the puppet troops, Okamura also indicated that he could discuss the matter with Mutō and determine a method of assistance so as not to cause difficulties for our side. However, it is still difficult to predict whether Okamura's words are reliable. Our side has already decided on appropriate measures and will begin to implement them in the near future.

<h3>Welcoming Generals Ma and Su Home Dong</h3>
<p>The national heroes of arduous resistance against Japan, General Ma Zhanshan and General Su Bingwen, and their entourage, arrived in Shanghai last night. Today, when the strong enemy is pressing and a ceasefire and peace negotiations are being held in Hebei, we welcome these leaders of resistance against Japan who have returned from a hundred battles. On the one hand, we are wholeheartedly admiring and expressing our utmost respect, but on the other hand, we feel a hundred emotions gathering, and we cannot restrain our grief and indignation. Recalling the beginning of the September 18th Incident, the officials in the Northeast who were responsible for defending the territory either retreated with their entire army, surrendering to the enemy with folded hands, or surrendered at the sight of the wind, willingly becoming accomplices of the tiger. It was at this moment of lost honor and public indignation that General Ma rose up in Heilongjiang Province in early November of the previous year, fighting alone. The Battle of Nenjiang shocked China and abroad, boosting the morale of the entire nation and refreshing the eyes and ears of international figures. In early December of last year, there was the fierce battle of Baiquan. When ammunition and reinforcements ran out, he had no choice but to retreat into Soviet territory with General Su Bingwen and others. We recall his telegram at the time, saying, "As long as I have a breath, I will never surrender the territory with folded hands. If the army is finished, I will train the militia in eastern Heilongjiang and fight again." He also told an American reporter, "Even if there is only one horse and one soldier left, I will persevere to the end." These resolute words are as if we can hear him speak. General Su Bingwen also repeatedly defeated the strong enemy after unfurling the banner of resistance against Japan on the China Eastern Railway on September 27th of last year. Finally, on the evening of December 4th, he reluctantly retreated into Soviet territory. His telegram at the time also stated, "Retreating towards the Soviet border, planning to borrow the route to return home to carry out other work. As long as I have a breath, this will will not waver." Generals like Ma and Su are truly what is meant by "strong grass is known in a storm, and loyal ministers are recognized in a chaotic world." Their arduous efforts are enough to shame those unresisting soldiers who are living in comfort and those unashamed national traitors who are willing to become accomplices of the tiger. We imagine that if all our national soldiers were like Ma and Su, then our national territory would never have been seized by the enemy on such a large scale and so quickly. However, looking around the country, how many Ma and Su are there? How can we expect the country not to be chaotic and weak, not to be invaded and dominated by others? Yet, we still have something to say to Generals Ma and Su. Although the war in Hebei has ceased and talk of peace is rampant today, the people of the whole country are undoubtedly grieving at this disguised surrender that sacrifices them in pain. The people's vision is the clearest, and the people's ears are the most discerning. Looking at the enthusiastic donations of the people of the whole country to the soldiers resisting Japan and the volunteer army since the September 18th Incident of the previous year, we can see where public opinion lies. The ancestral tombs of the two generals have now been turned into areas where foxes and ghosts roam. The comrades-in-arms of the past have all become heroic ghosts, and they themselves were forced to retreat into neighboring countries, almost with no country to save them. Today, returning from ten thousand miles away, looking north with their heads raised, how can they not be heartbroken, weeping blood, and infinitely grieved? How will they continue to fight in the future to comfort the expectations of the people of the country? This is one point. Secondly, the two generals have visited the Soviet Union and all the countries of Europe. The trend of the times and the way of establishing a nation in each country, I think they have all had a detailed comparative observation. Then, what is the root cause of China's weakness and lack of progress today? And what is the way to maintain its survival and freedom in the future? The civilization of the times is advancing day by day. Today's soldiers should not only know how to gallop on the battlefield and serve the country. They should also have a considerable understanding of the trends of the times and the world's political and economic situation. So, do the two generals have any insights and gains regarding the future of our country?</p>
<p>In short, the reason why we welcome the two generals today is that they can resist Japan for the survival of the nation. Today, the four northeastern provinces have not been recovered, and the lands east of the Luo River are still in the hands of the enemy. The national territory is shrinking day by day. The expectations of the people of the country for the two generals are great. How will the two generals carry out their original intentions and fulfill their vows? We look forward to it.</p>
<p>President Wang's Report on the Nature of the Ceasefire in Hebei</p>
<h3>At the Weekly Memorial Service at the Central Party Headquarters</h3>
<p>Nanjing – The Central Government held its 81st weekly memorial service at 8 am on the 5th. Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Chen Shuren, Li Jingqi, Zheng Zhannan, Ye Chucang, Jing Hengyi, Wang Qi, Xiao Zhongzhen, and all staff members, totaling about a thousand people, attended. Ju Zheng presided over the meeting, and Wang Zhaoming gave a report, which ended at 9:30 am. Here is a summary of Wang Zhaoming's report:</p>
<p>(1) First, the most important thing this week is the Hebei ceasefire. The talks I made when I returned to Nanjing from Jiujiang on May 31 and the telegrams I sent on June 2 have already explained this. The nature of the Hebei ceasefire is roughly the same as the Shanghai ceasefire last year, limited to military affairs and not involving politics. However, in terms of the situation, there are differences. As a result of the Shanghai ceasefire, Japanese soldiers disembarked and returned home. As a result of the Hebei ceasefire, Japanese soldiers will at most withdraw outside the Great Wall. If we acknowledge this, it seems that we are acknowledging that everything outside the Great Wall is no longer our territory. But in fact, theoretically, this is not the case. For example, if a person lives in a house and is forcibly occupied by someone else, they are not listened to when they reason with him, and when they fight, they are beaten out the door, to the center of the street, seriously injured and unable to move, temporarily lying in the center of the street. This is naturally extremely unlucky, but this person has not admitted to giving the house to him, especially not handing over the property deed to him. From this, it can be seen that the Hebei ceasefire cannot be regarded as giving up everything outside the Great Wall as not our territory.</p>
<p>(2) Second, since China has signed various conventions on world peace, it is appropriate to resolve international disputes peacefully. The League of Nations and the signatory countries are jointly responsible for resolving the Sino-Japanese dispute and are not biased towards any one country. They consider the Sino-Japanese issue as part of the world's problems. For the sake of maintaining world peace, it is necessary to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute together. On this point, Japanese public opinion has made many accusations against China, believing that China is still using the old method of "using barbarians to control barbarians." This is a great misunderstanding. If China provokes other countries to harm Japan for no reason, it is naturally wrong for China. However, the fact is not so. It is Japan that is harming China. For example, when a person is harmed, they cannot be forbidden to call for help. Moreover, international cooperation is the trend of the world. Since China and Japan cannot transcend the world, they cannot violate the trend of international cooperation. Moreover, international cooperation is based on fairness and mutual benefit. Using international cooperation to resolve the Sino-Japanese dispute does not harm the face or substance of any country. I believe that if Japanese public opinion understands this point, there will be no misunderstanding of "using barbarians to control barbarians." Moreover, some of Japanese public opinion clearly knows to emphasize Sino-Japanese coexistence and not aggression. To make this part of public opinion seen and implemented in Japan, it requires the efforts of the Japanese people on the one hand, and the efforts of the Chinese people on the other. If the efforts of the people of both countries can make the proposition of Sino-Japanese coexistence a reality, this will not only not hinder the resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute through international cooperation, but will also complement each other. Then, the misunderstanding of "using barbarians to control barbarians" will be resolved without saying a word. (3) Finally, recovering lost territory by force is not a complete statement. At the very least, it should be said that the recovery of lost territory is by national strength, because force is only part of national strength. Moreover, sufficient force is the result of the development of national strength. Without the development of national strength, force will not be sufficient. Today, we must focus on sufficient force, especially on developing national strength. This is the fundamental way to save the country and survive. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Cutting Off Joint Transport of East and Ussuri Railways: Soviet Russia Lodges Protest with Japan</p>
<p>Illegal Actions Disrupting the Agreement</p>
<p>Carried Out by Japanese Personnel of the Puppet State</p>
<p>Hoping Japan Will Take Necessary Measures to Restore Original State</p>
<p>If Sale of the Railway is Realized, We Will File Another Protest</p>
<p>Moscow: Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Sokolnikov today delivered a note to Japanese Ambassador to Russia Ota, detailing the illegal actions of the "Manchukuo" authorities in cutting off the joint transport of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway, and requested the Japanese government to take necessary measures to restore the normal situation. The note stated, "According to reliable information, a police force led by Sato, a Japanese official of the "Manchukuo" Ministry of Transportation, cut off the joint transport of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway at Pogranichnaya station on May 31st. The stationmaster at Pogranichnaya received an order, signed by Sato, the director of the railway police bureau Yan Shiyuan (transliteration), and a White Russian police officer Nonikov, demanding that the joint cargo transport between the two railways be immediately stopped, and stating that coercive measures would be taken if the order was not executed. The stationmaster immediately protested in writing, pointing out that the order was procedurally improper and the signatures were not legally valid, and returned the order to the "Manchukuo" authorities, suggesting that the Chinese Eastern Railway Administration should be notified. However, the police force not only ignored the stationmaster's protest but also set up an armed guard at the station, forcibly seizing the keys to the connecting line and detaining the stationmaster from 11:40 AM to 2:00 PM. The original railway police at the station were also arrested, and the police force forced railway workers to pile sleepers on the tracks to block traffic. A total of six sets of tracks were blocked at that time, five on the west side and one on the east side. Obstacles were also built on the road connecting Pogranichnaya station with the Russian station of Grodekovo. According to Sato, these obstacles were only to be raised when passenger trains were allowed to pass." Sokolnikov's note continued, "These illegal actions, which violate existing treaties and the special agreement between the Chinese Eastern and Ussuri Railways, have blocked traffic between the Chinese Eastern Railway and the Ussuri Railway. This violent act of disrupting the agreement was carried out by Japanese official Sato of "Manchukuo", which further proves that the Soviet government's note of May 31st was factual and reasonable." Sokolnikov also stated, "The Soviet government received a statement from the Japanese government on May 29th regarding the illegal actions planned at the meeting at the Japanese Embassy in Changchun. The Soviet government has the right to expect the Japanese government to prevent unilateral and foolish actions from undermining the legal status of the Chinese Eastern Railway based on this statement." Sokolnikov continued, "I cannot but protest against this unreasonable action by the "Manchukuo" authorities, which is an organized attempt to worsen relations between Japan and Russia." After requesting Honda to forward the protest to the Japanese government, Sokolnikov added, "Since the Japanese government is concerned about maintaining peace and security in Manchuria and is willing to act as a mediator in fundamentally resolving the Chinese Eastern Railway issue, I sincerely hope that the Japanese government will take necessary steps to restore the situation to its undamaged state." (5th TASS Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet reply has now arrived at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

It is reported that the representatives of all parties are as follows: the Soviet representative will be Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev, while "Manchukuo" will be represented by Ding Jianxiu (traitor), the (puppet) Minister of Transportation, Ding Shiyuan (traitor), the (puppet) envoy to Japan, O’hashi, the (Japanese) Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Togo, the director of the European Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The formal meetings will be direct negotiations between Russia and "Manchukuo", with Japan only acting as an intermediary. O’hashi, the (puppet) Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, will return to Changchun shortly to discuss the Chinese Eastern Railway issue with the authorities, and will return to Japan on June 25th to begin formal negotiations on the same day. (5th Reuters Dispatch) (Nanjing) The sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway by Soviet Russia, orchestrated behind the scenes by Japan with a puppet organization appearing in public to negotiate, is gradually nearing completion. The Japanese Ambassador to Russia formally expressed his acceptance of the Soviet proposal to sell the railway to the Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on May 29th and suggested that negotiations begin in Tokyo on June 26th, two weeks after the opening of the World Economic Conference. The Russian Ministry of Foreign Affairs also expressed its acceptance on the 2nd. It is reported that when negotiations on the sale of the railway begin, the Japanese side will decide to have representatives from the puppet organization negotiate in order to reduce international opposition and jealousy and to promote Soviet recognition of the puppet organization. Furthermore, in the Japanese note to Russia, it was stated that the issue should be resolved politically, not explored technically, and it was reiterated that the Chinese Eastern Railway had lost its economic significance. From this, it can be seen that Japan's purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway is clearly intended to exert extreme pressure to lower the price. Japan even threatened Soviet Russia, saying that if the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway was not resolved quickly, Russia would suffer unimaginable losses. Russia showed no resentment to this, demonstrating its complete surrender to Japanese violence. Russia has not yet responded to our protest, likely waiting until after a deal is reached with Japan. If the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway is indeed realized, our government will file another serious protest. (5th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Song Ziwen Arrives in London to Attend World Economic Conference</p>

(5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Song Ziwen arrived in England today. This morning, The Times published an editorial praising Song, calling him a special guest visiting England and saying that Song's achievements in the past two years have not proven overly optimistic about the future of the Nanjing government, which has many enemies, but at least it can be said that Song and Chiang Kai-shek's policies seem most capable of restoring China's prosperity. Song's policies are those of a realist, and implementing such policies shortly after the success of the revolution requires special perseverance. It is hoped that when meeting with the British Prime Minister and other British cabinet members, the British authorities will take advantage of Song's visit to England to discuss Sino-British relations with him in a spirit of friendship and cooperation. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>US Delegation Discusses Conference Proposals on Shipboard, Preparations Complete</p>
<p>New York: The "President Roosevelt" radioed that US Secretary of State Hull stated on board that the discussion of silver issues at the World Economic Conference may first be privately contacted, and then proposed to the conference. He will personally measure the direct discussion of major issues, and completely assign monetary issues to Pittman. According to the current plan, Pittman will submit his silver proposal to representatives of major financial countries, hoping to first obtain agreement on the extent of silver coinage, and then propose the suggestions of countries such as Britain and France to the conference. Hull did not want to comment on the radio report he received from the Senate passing a bill to repeal the gold standard. Since departing from New York, the fifteen experts traveling with him have been meeting on the ship every day to prepare the suggestions they plan to propose. It is reported that most of their work concerns stabilizing exchange rates and reducing tariffs. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>US Congress Unlikely to Convene Before Next January</p>
<p>So President Can Focus on Economic Conference</p>
<p>Washington: Today, after the US President invited Senator Robinson to go boating on the Potomac River, Robinson returned to Washington and told people that it had been decided that Congress should adjourn on Saturday so that the President could focus on the World Economic Conference. He also said that members of Congress were also deeply fatigued and eager to adjourn early and wait until January next year to reconvene for a regular session. The President told him that, in his view, there would likely be very few times when emergency bills would need to be enacted. The situation in industry and commerce has shown slight progress, and the banking crisis has also bottomed out. According to reports, almost all the important cases passed by this Congress were applied for or drafted by the President. At present, the US President has full authority to negotiate with various countries to stabilize exchange rates and conclude reciprocal trade agreements to reduce tariffs, and he can prohibit the export of gold, reset currency values, and has the power to correct the banking system. Unless there is another extremely emergency period, there is no need to convene a special session of Congress again. At this time, the only case that the President wants Congress to enact is the tax law, so as to guarantee the balance of the budget. Therefore, after returning to Washington, the President summoned several members of the House of Representatives, including Byrnes, to the White House and instructed them to completely eliminate the budget crisis before the adjournment.

<p>Japanese Government Decides on Policy</p>
<p>In Principle, Agrees to Raise Silver Prices</p>
<p>Focusing All Efforts on Preventing Global Boycotts of Goods</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Based on the report from representative Ishii, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Finance, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry consulted and decided to place special emphasis on raising silver prices, exchange rate ratios, and the issue of boycotts of goods at the World Economic Conference. The policies reported by the Dongbao are as follows: 1. Issue of raising silver prices: Japan can, in principle, agree to raising global silver prices to a certain level. However, adopting a gold-silver bimetallic standard will not only be ineffective unless it is implemented simultaneously by all countries in the world but will also contribute to speculation. 2. Issue of exchange rate ratios: Japan believes that the stability of the US dollar is a prerequisite, and the determination of the ratio between Japan and the US is a secondary issue. Japan is inconvenienced by the lack of foreign capital and cannot maintain an exchange rate that is disproportionate to its national strength. Japan will spare no effort to stabilize its exchange rate and cooperate with Britain and the United States, but it cannot raise its external exchange rate to the same extent as the United States. 3. Issue of boycotting Japanese goods: Japan believes that the Chinese boycott movement is not a problem for Japan alone. Every political problem is unfavorable to China, and regardless of which country is its opponent, boycotts are used to implement its national policy. The Japanese government believes that these movements are malicious obstructions to trade and are harmful to the recovery of the world economy. Based on this proposition, Japan will submit a bill to the conference to stop boycotts and request that the conference pass it. (5th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japan Completes Draft of Reply to US Peace Proposal</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japan has completed drafting its reply to Roosevelt's peace proposal after consultations between the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Army, and Navy. Foreign Minister Uchida will request approval from the Emperor after the regular cabinet meeting on the 6th, and will summon the US Ambassador to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the afternoon to hand over the reply for transmission to President Roosevelt. The reply is said to accept the principles but clarifies the special circumstances of the Far East and has two or three points of reservation. The reply will be released by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at the same time it is transmitted to President Roosevelt. (5th Electric News Dispatch)</p>
<p>Tokyo: Japan's reply expresses agreement in principle from an overall standpoint. As for the specific issues in the proposal, Japan has already sent representatives to the Disarmament Conference and the Economic Conference, where they can be discussed, so it only explains the Japanese government's policy. As for the Japanese government's policy on the tariff guarantee clause in the first part of the MacDonald Plan, it cannot be accepted, as has been stated repeatedly. Regarding the principle of inviolability of borders in the US President's proposal, when Representative Ishii met with Roosevelt, he questioned and answered, and the United States has understood Japan's views. Also, regarding cooperation to achieve the objectives of the Economic Conference, both sides have long been in agreement. Therefore, this reply does not only point out specific matters and make reservations, but everything will be stated by the plenipotentiary at the conference. (6th Electric News Dispatch)</p>

<p>Overseas Chinese in Singapore Maintain Patriotism and Continue to Refuse to Buy Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Singapore: Some Japanese goods recently burned in Singapore and Penang, including 2,000 boxes of salted fish and pastries, were auctioned off in less than two days and quickly sold out. Most of the buyers were Chinese and Indian merchants. In addition, 300 boxes of Japanese cloth, rubber shoes, light bulbs, and canvas were sold out in a few hours at very low prices. The Chinese merchants, greedy for their cheapness, no longer considered them to be enemy goods. However, Singapore is different. Local newspapers still carry news of the rejection of Japanese goods within China. Merchants do not want to incur the wrath of the Chinese, so they do not buy Japanese goods. However, there are still some people who use Chinese trademarks on Japanese goods. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Germany and Austria Deepen Resentment, Italy to Mediate</p>

<p>International Labor Report: Unemployment Panic is Just Beginning</p>
<p>Geneva, April 4 (Havas) The Director of the International Labor Office, Butler, has prepared a report on the social impact of the economic panic, stating that according to statistics obtained by the International Labor Office, the number of unemployed is not decreasing but increasing daily. In 1931, Britain spent £120,000,000 on unemployment relief, while Germany spent 2,338,000,000 gold marks, France spent 653,500,000 francs, and the United States spent $50,000,000 in a single month in September 1932. Butler believes that the way to relieve unemployment is still to increase employment, while insurance and relief are not solutions. Butler also said that the number of unemployed does not depend entirely on the economic panic. For example, in 1928, the world's economy was extremely prosperous, but the number of unemployed was still in the millions. Even if the panic ends, it still cannot eliminate unemployment for everyone. His conclusion is that the main problem lies in restoring the balance between production and consumption, which is the fundamental solution to relieving unemployment.</p>

<p>"House of Tomorrow" Model Constructed Entirely of Glass to Be Displayed at Chicago Exposition</p>
<p>Chicago (Reuters) A Chicago architect has designed a "House of Tomorrow" made of glass, which will be displayed in the Department of Home and Industrial Arts in the Hall of Progress at the Chicago Exposition. The "backbone" and "nerve center" of this house is a 300-foot-long tunnel, which houses all the electrical heating equipment and water sources. The glass used is thick and strong, not easily broken. The shape of the house is like a three-story cake, with each layer smaller in diameter than the layer below. It has twelve sides and, in addition to glass, uses steel and prefabricated building materials. The lower layer is a semi-basement, with walls made of a new type of soundproof board. The second layer is the living area, with outer walls separated by glass so that sunlight can penetrate and neighbors can see through. If you want to be unseen, it only takes a flick of a finger to lower the curtains on all four walls, and you can live in seclusion. The lowest level houses a garage and aircraft hangar. Doors, windows, locks, etc., are all opened and closed electrically, so there is no need to fumble in the dark.</p>
<p>Internal Strife in Japan's Seiyukai Intensifies, Radical and Conservative Factions Clash</p>
<p>Tokyo, May 5 (China United Press) The internal strife within Japan's Seiyukai is intensifying. The radical faction is demanding that President Suzuki promptly implement the resolutions of the executive committee. If Suzuki disregards their resolutions, General Affairs Manager Shimada and Secretary-General Yamaguchi, in order to save face, will inevitably oppose President Suzuki, and the situation is gradually approaching division. The Minseito originally advocated a coalition cabinet. However, due to the internal strife in the Seiyukai and the military's firm support for Prime Minister Saito, the party's atmosphere has changed, and it has decided to unanimously support the current government. The coalition cabinet theory of Tokonami and Kuhara has gradually been abandoned, as it is expected that the Seiyukai will inevitably split in the near future.</p>
<p>Tokyo, May 5 (Electric News) Seiyukai President Suzuki, in order to avoid party disputes, will return to Tokyo about ten days after visiting the Ise Grand Shrine and the Momoyama Imperial Mausoleum. When he returns to Tokyo, he will get off the train in Shizuoka to visit Saionji and report on the political situation and the opposition between the radical and conservative factions within the party. He will then consult with Prince Saionji. Suzuki's actions are based on the advice of the conservative faction.</p>

<p>Ghosts in Chilean Senate</p>
<p>Santiago, Chile (Reuters) Recently, while the Senate was in session here, an official entered the meeting hall, claiming to have been driven out by ghosts. At that time, six Senate guards and several senators inspected the small house on the roof of the meeting hall, where the official encountered the ghosts, and indeed found traces of them. As a result, the atmosphere in the meeting hall suddenly became serious, and the Senate police also said that they often heard women crying in the hall at night. The senators all believed that this was caused by the victims of the great fire in 1863. It is reported that the Chilean Congress is located next to the Church of the Compania, which was destroyed by fire in 1863, killing 2,000 people, especially women, creating the most famous fire in South American history. The ghosts in the current Senate are thought to be those who perished in the fire in the past.</p>

<p>Situation in Chahar Tense</p>
<p>Liu Guitang's Rebel Troops Have Entered Guyuan</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang's Measures After Taking Office</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement is a local ceasefire, its scope limited to the Great Wall and east to Shanhaiguan and west to Yanqing in Chahar Province. The area bordering Chahar north of Yanqing is not within the scope of the ceasefire. In other words, the Japanese army is not restricted from attacking Chahar from western Jehol, and it is not impossible for our army to recover the area bordering Jehol from eastern Chahar. The Japanese army will be difficult to forget Chahar, as it is integral to completing its Manchurian-Mongolian policy, but for the moment, because the situation in Chahar Province is complex, it will not advance hastily, only allowing Liu Guitang, Cui Xinwu, and other rebel troops to cause disturbances there. Liu's rebel troops invaded Guyuan on the 31st of last month, and the situation in eastern Chahar has fallen into chaos. According to news released by the Pingfang military agency, Zhao Chengshou telegraphed Dongwu that, according to reports, Liu Guitang's rebel troops entered Guyuan on the 31st, looting wildly, causing merchants and residents to flee. He also released prisoners. Furthermore, Tang Yulin's troops are now stationed 50-60 li south of Guyuan in the Ershili Naobao area, with large and small areas of encroachment. Awaiting detailed investigation and follow-up reports.</p>
<p>Since Feng Yuxiang took office as Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army of the People, he has taken many measures in Chahar. In addition to appointing Feng Lingge as the representative chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government and Ji Hongchang as the garrison commander and director of the Public Security Bureau, many other military and political personnel have also been replaced. Feng Zhanhai currently holds the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army of the People, and his troops are still under his command. Feng's guard team originally had only over 2,000 people, but the training team run by Jiang Song Zheyuan in Chahar recently, as well as conscription from various counties, have been reorganized and expanded to over 20,000 people. In addition, miscellaneous troops and militias have been recruited and expanded in strength. Zhang Ziguang, Cao Dongchen, and Yu Yuling have been appointed as division commanders of the Chahar Provincial Self-Defense Army. In total, Feng's guard team and the troops under his command, such as Fang Zhenwu and Feng Zhanhai, as well as the military and civilian militias, number in the hundreds of thousands. Furthermore, Sun Dianying's 41st Army and the Jin Army's Li Fuying and Zhao Chengshou's troops are still stationed in Chahar. Feng has adopted a liaison attitude with them all in the interest of a united anti-Japanese front. Feng's headquarters is located in a library in Tuergou. His personal residence is extremely secret. The slogans posted and the army collar badges mostly use red. The language he issues is geared toward the common people, abolishing exorbitant taxes and expressing great goodwill toward the people. Zhangjiakou was extremely panicked on the 24th and 25th. After Feng took office on the 26th, the people's hearts gradually stabilized. The police firearms have been completely confiscated, and only batons are used to maintain order. The area is still relatively peaceful. Along the Ping-Sui Railway, from Zhangjiakou in the north to Kangzhuang in the south, troops are stationed and inspected at each station by Feng. Qinglongqiao south of Kangzhuang is guarded by the Central Army. The inspection of travelers is extremely strict. Feng pays great attention to the Mongolian banners and plans to convene a Mongolian banner meeting in Zhangjiakou on the 15th of this month to discuss everything. The troops stationed in Chahar were extremely complex, and military discipline was non-existent. Residents suffered greatly. Since Feng took office, he has made every effort to maintain military and social discipline, which has gradually become more disciplined. (June 3rd)</p>
<p>Puppet Troops Loot Villages in Tong County</p>
<p>The Situation of Burning Down Villages is Extremely Tragic</p>
<p>Yu Xuezhong Goes to Beiping to Discuss Methods for Receiving Lost Territories</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement has been completed and signed by the representatives of both countries. Our representative Xiong Bin and his entourage Xu Zuyi, Lei Rong, Yin Rugeng, and Qian Zongze arrived in Hankou one after another on the day before yesterday (2nd) to contact the Japanese commander in Hankou Nakamura and Yonghan to negotiate the implementation of the agreement. Both sides are carrying out the withdrawal of troops. The restoration of traffic between Beining Railway and Pingyu, and the receipt of lost territories in Hebei Province are being discussed by Xiong and various parties. The most important issue now is the disposal of the puppet troops. Although the Japanese side has expressed that it will no longer support the puppet troops Li Jichun and others, allowing us to deal with them freely, these rebels are a motley crew. Their organizational members are mostly from the banditry, have long served as bandits in the Northeast, are familiar with the geography, and are skilled in horsemanship. They are difficult to eliminate temporarily, appearing and disappearing in the dangerous mountain forests with no fixed traces. Therefore, the organization of special police to maintain the security of the demilitarized zone is an urgent task. Hebei Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong arrived in Beiping this morning (3rd) by special train from Hankou. Ping-Sui Railway Bureau Director Tang Guozhen and Division Commander Liu Duoquan greeted him at the station. Yu arrived at 1:10 PM, got off the train and went directly to Jurentang by car to meet with He Yingqin and Huang Fu to discuss everything. Relief for the losses in the counties in the war zone will also be planned. As for the receipt of lost territories, it will be actively carried out as soon as the Japanese troops withdraw. At the same time, it is not allowed to engage in training within a short period of time for the organization of special police. Approximately, the Pinghan Security Brigade will be dispatched as soon as possible to various places to maintain security, and then police will be recruited and trained calmly. Strictly suppressing bandits can achieve familiar results and avoid the disadvantages of being unfamiliar with the area. All the puppet troops will not be difficult to solve.</p>
<p>Last night (2nd), at about 1:00 AM, puppet troops from Li Jichun's unit were discovered east of Lutai and near Zhakou. It was verified that two brigades of Han Fuchen, etc., occupied nearby villages in the dark, totaling over 1,500 puppet troops with over 700 firearms. Our troops, in compliance with the agreement, made every effort to avoid conflict and did not retaliate. The reverse is now in various Zhuzhuangs. A large number of puppet troops are stationed there, totaling about 5,000 to 6,000 people. Disturbances occur from time to time. The Japanese troops in Tongzhou are still located ten li away in the east of the city and have not prepared to withdraw. He Xiwu, located southeast of Tongzhou, 5 miles away from Hexiwu, attacked the villages and carried out killings and looting last night because our troops had withdrawn to the west of Tongzhou in accordance with the agreement. More than one hundred village houses were set on fire at a time when it was raining. Villagers, young and old, struggled to escape in the mud. The situation was extremely tragic. Many women were raped. Women from twelve to fifty years old were mostly spared. At about 12:00 PM this afternoon, the Tongzhou express train arrived in Beiping, fully loaded with no less than 500 or 600 women and children who had fled. Small-footed women accounted for the majority. Those who described the situation at the time were terrified. (3rd)</p>

Director Dong immediately sent Xu Jingxian and Lu Qihua with a letter on the afternoon of the 3rd, accompanied by accountant Yang Jundu and his sister Yang Shaoying (both women), to the Public Security Bureau for Zhou to personally recognize.

<h3>Generals Ma and Su Arrive in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Represents the Central Government in Welcoming Them Aboard</p>
<p>A Reception for the Press This Morning, Going to Nanjing Within Days</p>
<p>The Two Said That They Will Obey the Central Government in Resisting Japan in the Future</p>
<p>Various Organizations are Preparing a Grand Welcome</p>
<p>Ma Zhanshan, the former chairman of Heilongjiang Province, an anti-Japanese hero and national hero, and Su Bingwen, the commander-in-chief of the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army, and a group of 14 people in total, returned to China aboard the Italian postal ship Conto Rosso. The ship was originally scheduled to arrive at the port yesterday afternoon, but when it arrived at the Tongsha sea area, it encountered fog and stopped, delaying its entry. It did not enter the Wusongkou until 8:30 last night and docked at the Qichang Wharf in Pudong at 10:00. The customs specially prepared the Jinghui small ship to welcome Mayor Wu and others. After Generals Ma and Su landed, they went directly to the Army Club on Jingji Road in Longhua to rest. A reception for the press is scheduled for 10:00 this morning, and they will go to Nanjing within days. The details are as follows: Strict Security</p>
<p>Generals Ma and Su originally planned to land at the New Customs Wharf. The Public Security Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession temporarily dispatched a large number of Chinese and Western armed detectives to protect the wharf. Anyone entering the ferry was strictly checked for passes, otherwise they would not be allowed to board the ship. When the Conto Rosso ship arrived at the Qichang Wharf, Wu Tiecheng, the representative of the central government, welcomed them to the Jinghun small ship. The landing was temporarily changed to the Guanhua Wharf on the Sixteenth Pier. In addition to the police brigade dispatched by the Municipal Public Security Bureau to guard the Qichang Wharf, there was also a water patrol team patrolling the Pudong area. As for the Guanhua Wharf area, the police officers of the Municipal Public Security Bureau were responsible for maintaining order. From the Sixteenth Pier in the north to Dongjiadu in the south, posts were densely arranged on both sides of the outer Ma Road for patrols. When the Jinghui ship docked, pedestrians and vehicles were prohibited from passing through. The security was extremely strict.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome</p>
<p>Since learning the news that Generals Ma and Su had arrived in Shanghai, various circles in this city have been preparing to welcome them. The central government temporarily telegraphed Mayor Wu to represent the central government in welcoming Generals Ma and Su. Therefore, Wu took the Jinghui small ship at around 8:00, accompanied by Jiang Huaishu, the representative of the municipal party department, Yang Hu, the director of the security department, Wen Hongen, the director of the municipal public security bureau, and others, to wait at the Qichang Wharf in advance. Others such as General Zhu Ziqiao, Zang Qifang, the representative of the Northeast Association, Yan Zhifang, Wu Shan, and Chen Yafu, the representatives of the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association, Tang Shixuan, the secretary of the municipal government, Xu Jingde, the acting garrison commander of Heilongjiang Province, Tai Binshan, the army commander of the 1st Army of Ma's army, Xu Haiting, the army commander of the 4th Army, Ma Gongzi Kui, Nephew Gongzi Zongshi, and more than one hundred representatives from various agencies and groups, as well as about 300 employees from the Postal Workers' Union, holding welcoming flags and carrying bamboo and cloth banners with slogans such as "Welcome Anti-Japanese Heroes Generals Ma Zhanshan and Su Bingwen". The Municipal Public Security Bureau sent a military band to play music. Generals Ma and Su slowly disembarked from the ship amidst the military music and the cheers of the people and transferred to the Jinghui small ship. This unprecedented welcome fully demonstrated the determination of the Chinese people to worship heroes and resist Japan.</p>
<p>Arrival Situation</p>
<p>The Conto Rosso ship sailed into the Songkou at 8:30 last night and docked at the Qichang Wharf at 10:00. After checking their bodies and passports, the welcomers were allowed to board the ship one by one. However, many policemen stood at the entrance of the cabin, preventing the welcomers from entering the cabin. Even journalists were unreasonably rejected and insulted. After repeated negotiations, they were allowed to board the ship. Generals Ma and Su stood on the deck, and Zang Qifang, the general manager of the Northeast Association, introduced them to the crowd standing on the wharf. Generals Ma and Su then returned to the cabin to meet with reporters, had a few words with them, and then went downstairs with Mayor Wu and Yang Hu and Zhu Ziqiao to transfer to the Jinghui small ship, landed at the Nanshi Guanhua Wharf, and then took a car to the Army Club on Jingji Road to rest. The rest of the entourage lived in the Dahua Hotel on Simalu Road.</p>
<p>People Traveling Together</p>
<p>Those who accompanied Generals Ma and Su to return to China this time included Xie Ke, the chief of staff of the Northeastern People's National Salvation Army, Yuan Shi'an, Su's secretary, Ning Lie, a German secretary, Tong Yue, an English secretary, Zhang Fengqi, Ma's adjutant, Ma's and Su's wives, and attendants, totaling 14 people. In addition, there were Lang Guanpu, the acting chairman of Heilongjiang Province, Su Gongzi Zongjun, Wu Huanzhang, Ma's representative in Shanghai, Fan Ruizheng, Su's representative in Peiping, Jiang Songnian, a senator of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, Liang Zhenduo, the commander-in-chief of the Heilongjiang Provincial Army, Rong Suhe, the chief of staff of Ma's army, Guo Zhushu, the director of the secretariat of Su's army, Duan Zhongfan, Ma's representative in Peiping, Li Mingxin, Deng Wen's representative, Ke Yin, a secretary of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, and Xu Yan, Shan Zhiyuan, Wang Yingjun, Wang Wenkui, and other 15 Northeastern People's representatives returning from Russia. All of them also returned to Shanghai on the same ship.</p>
<p>Generals Ma and Su's Demeanor</p>
<p>After Mayor Wu and others boarded the ship, the welcomers boarded the ship one after another. However, reporters were prevented from boarding the ship. Generals Ma and Su insisted on meeting them, and after repeated negotiations, they boarded the ship one after another and shook hands with Generals Ma and Su in the hall. Ma was wearing a black suit, white flannel trousers, and white leather shoes. He was short in stature, had a mustache, and his face looked slightly thin. However, a kind of majestic spirit was often revealed in his eyebrows. Su was tall and burly, wearing a gray serge suit, with a amiable smile and an extremely humble attitude.</p>
<p>Staying at the Club</p>
<p>After Generals Ma and Su arrived in Shanghai, the Municipal Government found the Army Club on Jingji Road as their residence. Ma's wife and daughter stayed at Ma's residence at No. 28 Sande Lane, Luban Road. Su's wife and two sons stayed at No. 251 Datong Hotel. The officers who came with Generals Su and Ma and the representatives from Peiping and the south all lived in rooms Nos. 222, 223, and 616 of the Datong Hotel.</p>
<p>Luncheon Today</p>
<p>Mayor Wu of the Municipal Government originally planned to hold a luncheon at the Army Club at noon yesterday. However, due to the ship's delay due to heavy fog, the Municipal Government's First Department notified all parties to change it to 12:00 noon today, still at the Army Club on Jingji Road, to hold a luncheon for Generals Ma and Su.</p>
<p>Reception for Reporters</p>
<p>Generals Ma and Su have decided to invite reporters from local newspapers at the Army Club at 10:00 AM today to report everything about their anti-Japanese experience, their situation after leaving Russia, and their opinions on resisting Japan in the future. As for the date of Generals Ma and Su's trip to Nanjing after arriving in Shanghai, it has not yet been determined because they still have to attend social events in this city. However, according to Mayor Wu, Generals Ma and Su will stay in Shanghai for a maximum of two days. Common conversation</p>
<p>Generals Ma and Su met with reporters from various newspapers on the Conto Rosso ship last night and had a brief conversation. Generals Ma and Su said: "I am very grateful for your welcome today. However, due to the urgency of time, I cannot have a long talk with you. I am very sorry. The reason for leaving Russia this time is that the soldiers fought hard day and night, and they had to retreat due to lack of ammunition and reinforcements. They stayed in Russia for four months and in Germany for two weeks, and their feelings were very harmonious. They met Mr. Zhang Xueliang in Italy. Now that they have returned to Chinese soil, they recall that the people provided assistance in an endless stream in the past, but they failed to drive the enemy out of the country, which is a shame to the people of the country. We are resisting Japan for the sake of the national body. We do not consider the success or failure. The future anti-Japanese plan should be decided by the central government. According to our opinion, if the central government orders us to lead the army north to resist Japan, we will continue to work hard until death. I (Ma) returned to China this time because the regiment and brigade commanders of my unit sent 24 urgent telegrams urging me to return. The date of entering Beijing after arriving in Shanghai has not yet been decided. After entering Beijing, I will submit a written report on my anti-Japanese experience in the Northeast for one and a half years, the local people's conditions, and the actual situation of fighting the Japanese army. As for the Daily Telegraph's claim that I died in battle, it was due to misinformation due to injury. At that time, I led a team of more than 1,000 people to fight the Japanese army, and only more than 20 people survived. My cheeks were injured by bullets." Finally, when reporters asked about their feelings on the North China ceasefire agreement, the two generals smiled and said, "We have been abroad for a long time. We were on the way when the North China ceasefire agreement was signed. We are separated from the situation, so it is not convenient to express anything."</p>
<p>Preparing to Welcome</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' Federation of this city has contacted groups to organize the "Shanghai All Circles Welcome Anti-Japanese Heroes Ma and Su Return to China Preparatory Committee" to prepare for holding a grand welcome meeting on a regular basis. It is now learned that the committee has scheduled to hold its first preparatory committee meeting at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM today to discuss the date and all welcome methods. At the same time, it will draft a welcome declaration, a letter to the people of the country, and a telegram to the central government requesting Generals Ma and Su to restart the anti-Japanese campaign and recover the lost land.</p>
<p>Eastern Newspaper Dissolution</p>
<p>The United China News Agency's Tokyo telegram on the 5th, Dongbao all published news of Ma Zhanshan's return to Shanghai this morning, but the word "pseudo" or the title "self-proclaimed" was added to Ma Zhanshan's head. A special correspondent of this agency asked the editors of various newspapers why this title was added. It was reported that during the Angu Town battle last year, the Kwantung Army believed that General Ma had died in battle. This official report had been reported to the Emperor of Japan by the Staff Headquarters, and General Ma's relics were displayed in the palace for the imperial relatives to visit. Today, it was discovered that General Ma Zhanshan had not died and had returned to Shanghai. The Kwantung Army should be held responsible for the crime of "deceiving the monarch and stealing merit." Therefore, the military department did not allow the newspapers to publish the truth and had no choice but to add the words "self-proclaimed" and "pseudo" to Ma's name in order to shirk responsibility.</p>

<p>Chongqing-Chengdu Flight, Chengdu Reconstructs Airport</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Guangdong Line to Begin Trial Flights Next Month</h3>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation reports that operations on the Chongqing-Chengdu section after its opening have been good. The American Vice Chairman Mr. Bisset and the Head of Flight Operations Mr. Bender, who went to Chengdu some time ago to prepare for the opening of the route, have completed their tasks and returned to Shanghai the night before last. According to Mr. Bender's report to the company, the Chengdu airport, previously located at Fenghuangshan, was deemed too far from the city, requiring a three-hour round trip by car. Therefore, it was relocated to Shanhuba. The area was originally a stone dam, and the paving stones were often moved by rising tides. Therefore, construction has begun to fill and pave the area, which is a major project. Before completion, airplanes will temporarily take off and land there. Regarding the opening of the Shanghai-Guangdong line, the company previously sent Deputy Head of Flight Operations Mr. Nie Kaiyi to Hong Kong, Guangdong, Fujian, and other places to negotiate and establish airport offices. It has been decided to use seaplane airports, but Guangzhou also needs to set up a land airport. The site has been surveyed at Shougouling. The trial period is expected to be around the middle of next month. The Shanghai-Beiping line is one of the company's three major routes. Although business is not booming at present, the company is determined not to reduce flights or suspend service. It is believed that the situation in Beiping and Tianjin is gradually easing, and given some time, the route should prosper.</p>

However, it is reported that in addition to deciding on various measures to assist the development of Japanese business, to counteract anti-Japanese movements among the Chinese people, and to prevent the ideological deterioration of Japanese, Korean, and Taiwanese residents, the meeting will also focus on the issue of increasing police numbers. Observers believe that this move by the Japanese side has extremely serious implications.</p>
<h3>Zhonghua Industrial Factory Decides on Long-Term Shutdown</h3>
<p>Factory Manager Surrounded by Workers</p>
<p>The Zhonghua Industrial Factory on Bailinan Road in western Shanghai has recently been affected by the sluggish market, resulting in a sharp decline in business and an unsustainable situation. Reluctantly, operations were suspended on June 1st. More than 800 male and female workers, whose livelihoods were thus cut off, demanded that the factory continue operations to maintain their lives, but to no avail. A dispute arose yesterday, and the details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Shutdown Due to the impact of the sluggish market, the factory's business has declined, and although the losses are huge, it has been maintained with effort. Since this year, business has almost come to a standstill, eventually becoming unsustainable. Operations were suspended on June 1st. More than 800 male and female workers were alarmed. They believed that although the factory is currently suffering losses, it has made considerable profits in previous years. Therefore, they unanimously demanded that the factory maintain the status quo and continue operations.</p>
<p>Factory Notice Whether the factory will continue operations will be discussed and decided by the board of directors on the 3rd. Fearing disturbances from the workers, the factory issued a notice on the 1st, stating that after the suspension of work on this day, each worker would be given a subsidy of two dimes per day, except for the more than 30 workers in the flower tape department who are still working. Everyone else would receive the subsidy. Therefore, all workers had to wait quietly for the factory's response.</p>
<p>Dispute Arises After the board of directors met and discussed on the 3rd, it was still determined that it was unsustainable and decided on a long-term shutdown. Yesterday, the 4th, was a Sunday. All the workers came to the factory to await orders. The factory manager, Qi Fuming, came to the factory and politely reported to the workers that a long-term shutdown had been decided and that the subsidy would be canceled. Upon hearing this, the workers became disorderly and surrounded Qi Fuming in the factory, preventing him from leaving. After receiving a report, the Sixth District immediately dispatched police to investigate and report. By evening, it was reported that Qi Fuming had still not been able to leave the factory.</p>

<h3>Measures to Rescue Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>Bureau of Inspection Formulates Plan</p>
<p>Banking Industry to Adjust to the Best of Its Ability</p>
<p>Chinese tea is a unique product of our country. It now suffers from competition from tea from Japan, India, Ceylon, Java, etc., resulting in a sharp decline in sales. Chinese tea, which once ranked first in world exports, has fallen below Javanese tea. Tea merchants are on the verge of crisis. The Bureau of International Trade has convened a meeting of tea merchants to discuss rescue measures. The Director of the Bureau of Commodity Inspection has formulated a plan to improve Chinese tea, implement improvements, organize marketing cooperatives, and have the banking industry make adjustments to the best of its ability. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Reasons for Failure Cai Wuji, Director of the Bureau of Commodity Inspection, has provided a plan to improve Chinese tea. Excerpts are as follows: The reasons for the failure of Chinese tea are: (1) Producers lack a coordinated organization; (2) Tea cultivation does not use scientific methods; (3) Taxes are heavy; (4) Political instability; (5) Other countries are using their full spirit to encourage improvements in tea. Of the world's tea quantity, black tea accounts for nine-tenths, and green tea accounts for one-tenth. Russia has the largest sales volume, followed by Africa, the United States, and the United Kingdom. In 1915, the total export value of Chinese tea was 55,560,000 customs taels. In 1932, the total export value of Chinese tea was only 24,760,000 customs taels.</p>
<p>Investigation and Inspection To improve the domestic tea industry and expand foreign trade, it is necessary to actively investigate the cultivation and manufacturing conditions in various provinces, the improvement measures in various tea-producing countries. Plans are to send personnel to investigate the tea-producing areas in Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and the two Hunan provinces, and then to Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, and other places. At the same time, inspections will be made in Japan, Taiwan, India, Ceylon, Java, and other places as a reference for improving cultivation and manufacturing methods. Familiarity should be attained with overseas trade to conduct direct investigations or publicity in various countries, and commercial counselors should be established in overseas embassies to report and investigate the commercial conditions in each country. Detailed investigations must also be conducted in Tibet and Mongolia.</p>
<p>(Experiments and Research) Regarding research and experiments, it is urgent to plan the establishment of experimental and research institutions to conduct proper experiments on methods such as fertilization, pruning, tilling, and harvesting, and to conduct detailed research on techniques such as fermentation, drying, and storage. The soil suitability and various types of tea in various places should be analyzed in detail for comparison. Regarding experimental research matters, in addition to contacting the Anhui and Hunan tea experiment stations, the Commodity Inspection Bureau will cooperate with the Central Agricultural Experiment Station of the Ministry of Industry, the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau, and rent the Ningzhou Zhenzhi Company to establish a joint tea improvement farm to conduct research and experiments separately, and to recruit tea industry children from various places to provide them with appropriate training.</p>
<p>(Publicity and Guidance) The failure of Chinese tea abroad is due to a lack of publicity, and the poor quality of tea products in various provinces is due to a lack of guidance. For preliminary matters such as fertilizing, pruning, harvesting, and roasting, small booklets should be compiled and widely distributed, and personnel should be sent to various places to conduct investigations and give lectures at any time, explaining the history of the failure of Chinese tea and the directions for improvement, to arouse the attention of tea farmers and manufacturers. As for foreign publicity, specialists should be dispatched as soon as possible to promote Chinese tea in countries that need tea, or assign large amounts of money to publish powerful advertisements in magazines and newspapers in major cities in Europe and the United States, to show films of the actual situation of Chinese tea, to take advantage of exhibitions held in various countries to conduct grand publicity, or to open tea shops in important cities to provide trial drinks.</p>
<p>(Protection and Encouragement) Protection and encouragement are the responsibilities of the government. However, at present, the tea-producing areas of Fujian, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and the border areas of Hunan are areas where bandits are rampant, causing merchants to hold back and tea unable to be transported. Passive measures must fully protect tea merchants' collection and transportation to avoid danger. As for encouragement, rewards should be given to those who promote the joint cultivation of tea industry cooperatives in excellent tea gardens and to those who produce the highest quality tea. Encouragement should be given to those who open new tea gardens and try new machinery. Special subsidies should be given to tea merchants who export directly and to those who manufacture new tea-making machinery. Especially important is for the national treasury to guarantee the circulation of low-interest funds for tea merchants, and to send personnel to contact Russia and the United States, which have the greatest needs, to negotiate direct purchases. All these methods are essential.</p>
<p>(Improved Tea) A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency met with Wu Juenong, a technician from the Commodity Inspection Bureau, who said that the most important reason for the failure of Chinese tea is that the manufacturing methods of our country's tea are outdated, making it inconvenient for goods to be transported, and that there is too much exploitation, resulting in increased costs. Therefore, the Hankou Commodity Inspection Bureau and the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute have jointly rented the Ningzhou Zhenzhi Company in Baipengba, Ningzhou, Jiangxi Province, and renamed it the Ningzhou Joint Tea Improvement Farm to carry out improvements. As for the Ningzhou tea that was shipped to Shanghai, it was tested and improved, and then handed over to the British firm Jinlong Foreign Firm, which has the largest sales of tea in China, for research. The color and taste have now reached the level of Indian and Ceylonese tea.</p>
<p>(Marketing Cooperation) The Qi Men tea is the king of our country's tea industry. Due to inconvenient transportation, the mountain price and the market price differ by more than double. The Construction Department of the Anhui Provincial Government has established a provincial tea improvement farm at the site of the former National Tea Experimental Farm, equipped with various new machinery to improve manufacturing methods, and has organized the Qi Men Pingli Village Unlimited Liability Credit Marketing Cooperative. The first batch of Qi Men tea has now been shipped to Shanghai. The Hunan Provincial Government also operates a tea experiment farm in Anhua to carry out improvements, which is better than Japanese green tea. The green tea that could not be remanufactured in the past has now been successful.</p>
<p>(Loans and Relief) After the failure of Chinese tea in foreign trade, the Ministry of Industry ordered the banking industry associations in this city to adjust tea finance to the best of their ability. The Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Railways ordered the China Merchants Bureau and the two road administrations to find ways to reduce tea transportation costs. For relief purposes, the Bureau of International Trade is helping tea merchants and the banking industry to negotiate loans, with credit as collateral. The total amount is said to be 5 million yuan.</p>
<h3>Telegrams Regarding Sichuan War</h3>
<p>Deng Xihou's Telegram</p>
<p>Response from the Anti-War Association</p>
<p>The head office of the Abolish Internal War League received a telegram from Deng Xihou, the commander of the 14th Route Army of the 24th Army, through its Shanghai office. The League immediately replied to Deng's telegram. The following are the texts of the telegrams:</p>
<p>(Deng's Telegram) To the Shanghai office, urgently to the Abolish Internal War League: At this time, when the violent Japanese are eyeing Beiping and Tianjin and the Red bandits are invading Sichuan, it is heard that Xihou and Liu Wenhui are at war domestically, which is extremely contradictory to the League's aim. The colleagues of the League must scold Wenhui and Xihou as being insane. Xihou has joined the army since childhood and knows a bit about righteousness. He has always considered internal war as the most shameful thing. Would he act contrary to his principles and invite the people's scorn? I will explain the distant and recent causes and all the circumstances to the League. During the Sichuan War of Chennian, Xihou, under the clear order of the Central Government, tried his best to mediate, speaking until his tongue was dry and sending telegrams until his wrists were dislocated. He exhausted his mind and efforts to maintain peace. During the Rongwei War, Wenhui repeatedly threatened Xihou to join the battle to resolve the Chongqing issue. Xihou deeply resented the spread of war and refused. Wenhui harbored a grudge because of this. After the ceasefire, Xihou welcomed Wenhui to govern the province, but he suddenly lost dozens of counties and urgently wanted to avenge himself. He repeatedly encouraged Xihou to cooperate with him to attack Pu Cheng. Xihou was worried about the national crisis and refused to assist a villain. He repeatedly advised Wenhui, hoping he would wake up, but Wenhui resented Xihou for not helping him, and his resentment was unbreakable. In the winter of May of this year, Xihou received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, ordering him to withdraw troops to assist in suppressing the bandits. He complied and telegraphed on the 20th to rush to the war zone for inspection and withdrawal. As soon as he arrived in Xindu, Wenhui attacked Jiang and occupied Wen on the 21st, and occupied Jianyang on the 22nd. Then, he completely occupied the agencies of Xihou's troops in the province. Xihou telegraphed on the 27th to inquire about the reason for attacking the defense agencies, but Wenhui ignored him. On the 1st of the following month, he began attacking my army. Xihou still ordered his troops to retreat step by step, abandoning Pi and Jian. Wenhui continued to attack my army in several ways. Forced to defend themselves, my troops guarded along the river. For half a month, Wenhui attacked day and night without rest. He was repeatedly repelled, but he came back again and again, displaying his power, burning houses in Chongning, digging up the Dujiang Weir and the Jinzhu Weir, and doing everything possible to wreak havoc on the people. Although he repeatedly received clear orders from the Central Government to cease fire and return to their original defenses, Wenhui blatantly ignored them, collecting materials to cross the river day and night, intending to have his way. Xihou's original intention of abolishing internal war turned into a guide for Wenhui to launch an internal war. He felt guilty and sighed endlessly. However, his questions were unanswered, and he could not avoid the war. Wenhui ignored the national crisis and did not hesitate to create opportunities for the Red bandits. He acted like a jackal and a tiger. I sincerely state the truth so that the right and wrong can be judged by the people of the country. I hope that the League will uphold justice and condemn him with pen and tongue so that the shape of the evil spirits can be cast in the axe of Yu, compared to the slander of the Spring and Autumn period. I pray in the wind with anxiety. Deng Xihou.</p>
<p>(Reply from Anti-War League) The Anti-War League replies to Deng Xihou: To the Shanghai office of the 14th Route Army, Deng Xihou, Commander: I have received your telegram. During the first Sichuan War, this League, based on reports from all parties, considered Liu Xiang guilty. The Standing Committee of this League resolved to announce Liu Xiang's crimes to the people of the country so that they could condemn him together. Unexpectedly, another conflict broke out after only a few months. This League repeatedly telegraphed Liu Wenhui, offering advice and urging him to stop, but to no avail, which is deeply regrettable. Now that the foreign crisis is so serious, we still cannot avoid this senseless fight. The Executive Yuan has already established principles for reorganizing Sichuan affairs. Since you are pained by the national crisis and ashamed of internal war, you must first abide by them and await the government's resolution. Right and wrong will be judged by the public. You must not compete for a day. Special telegram to reply, I hope you will understand. The Abolish Internal War League.</p>
<h3>Trademark Bureau's Rebuttal to Mr. Nanning's Remarks</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that Mr. Nanning, a Conservative Party member of the British Parliament, stated in the House of Commons on May 29 that merchants in China were greatly dissatisfied with the ineffectiveness of the regulations implemented by the Chinese Trademark Bureau, stating that those who had registered in Beiping must now re-register in Nanjing, and that such ineffective repeated registrations were extremely troublesome. After this statement was published, He Zhuoxian, Director of the Trademark Bureau, issued a statement in rebuttal. According to investigations from various parties, the Bureau's recent work is as follows:</p>
<p>Adjudicated Cases Since its establishment, the Trademark Bureau has resolved a total of 354 adjudicated cases as of the end of May this year, including 126 cases between Chinese and Chinese, and 4 cases between Chinese and foreigners, all of which were won by the Chinese. There were 146 cases between foreigners and Chinese, of which 89 were won by foreigners. There were 78 cases between foreigners and foreigners. Thirty-three of the 354 cases were between Americans and Chinese, with Americans winning 17 cases. There were 42 cases between British and Chinese, of which 31 were won by the British and 11 by the Chinese. The Bureau has resolved a total of 52 re-adjudication cases as of the end of May, including 12 cases between Chinese and Chinese, and 12 cases of Chinese suing foreigners, all of which were won by foreigners. There were 22 cases of foreigners suing Chinese, with foreigners winning 14 cases. There were 6 cases between foreigners and foreigners. Of the 52 cases, 14 were between Americans and Chinese, with Americans winning 10 cases and Chinese winning 4 cases. There were 6 cases between British and Chinese, with British winning 4 cases and Chinese winning 2 cases. The Bureau has resolved a total of 109 objection cases as of the end of May, classified as follows: 43 cases between Chinese and Chinese, 12 cases of Chinese suing foreigners, with Chinese losing 4 cases. There were 25 cases of foreigners suing Chinese, with foreigners winning 15 cases. There were 29 cases between foreigners and foreigners. Of the 109 objection cases, 8 were between Chinese and Americans, with Chinese winning 4 cases and Americans winning 4 cases. There were 11 cases between British and Chinese, all of which were won by the British. The Bureau has resolved a total of 25 re-objection cases as of the end of May, including 8 cases between Chinese and Chinese, and 6 cases of Chinese suing foreigners, all of which were won by foreigners. There were 7 cases of foreigners suing Chinese, with foreigners winning 4 cases. There were 4 cases between foreigners and foreigners. Of the 25 re-examined and resolved cases, 6 were between Americans and Chinese, with Americans winning 4 cases and Chinese winning 2 cases. There were 2 cases between British and Chinese, which were won by the British. A summary is provided below: Of the 42 adjudicated cases, the British won 31 cases. Of the 6 re-adjudicated cases, the British won 4 cases. In the 11 objection cases, the British won all cases. In the 2 re-objection cases, the British also won all cases. The Bureau executes these judgments extremely quickly, and Chinese companies that have lost cases have never evaded the judgments, but have all obeyed and waited for execution according to the law. Therefore, from the above statistics, Mr. Nanning's accusations against the Trademark Bureau are completely unfounded.</p>
<p>Trademark Issues According to information from the Trademark Bureau, foreigners lack knowledge of the proper procedures for prosecuting trademark infringement, which often leads to misunderstandings of the Trademark Bureau and criticisms that the Bureau cannot prevent the infringement of trademark rights. According to its experience, the Bureau has noticed that many foreigners do not know how to handle counterfeit trademarks that have not been registered with the Bureau. When a foreigner's trademark is infringed by another trademark that has not been registered, they should first submit a certificate from the Bureau to prove the similarity of the two trademark drawings. If the Bureau finds that the two drawings are similar, then they can file a lawsuit in court. Chinese courts are now quite cooperative with the Bureau on trademark issues. Recently, a court in a remote county in South China sought the Bureau's opinion on two similar trademark drawings.</p>
<p>Lin Pengxia Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<h3>Returned from a Solo Investigation in the Northwest</h3>
<p>Ms. Lin Pengxia, a Chinese from Singapore, resolved to go to the Northwest alone last winter to investigate culture. After traveling through Jiangsu, Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, Suiyuan, Chahar, Beiping, Tianjin, and other places, she experienced frost, snow, and cold, and saw the tragic situation of the people's livelihood in the Northwest. It took six months and ten days, and she spent more than 3,000 yuan of her own money. The women she saw in various places were bound by old customs, so she was willing to devote herself to the Northwest to serve society. She plans to return to her country to visit and then plan to go west again. She returned to Shanghai yesterday from Tianjin on the Xinfeng, staying at the Xinhuizhong. Yesterday, she visited leaders of religious and national salvation organizations to jointly plan to rescue the people of the Northwest, which was met with sympathy. In the evening, she went to Pudong to welcome Ma Zhanshan. Today, she will attend the reception of the Women's Day celebration and the National Women's Youth Association. In the evening, she will go to Beijing to report to relevant departments.</p>
<h3>Silk Weaving and Silk Brocade Industries Joint Petition Delegation Set Off Yesterday</h3>
<p>Industrial and Commercial Groups Added Representatives</p>
<p>Petition for the Return of the Artificial Silk Tax</p>
<p>The Electric Machine Silk Weaving Industry and the Silk Brocade Industry Associations jointly dispatched a delegation to Beijing to petition. The preparations have been reported in this newspaper. It is now learned that the delegation departed by train at 3:10 PM yesterday. The Electric Machine Silk Weaving Industry sent Wang Tu-qiang, Gao Shi-heng, Qian Bo-xi, Cai Xin-tao, Wang Bao-tai, and other five people. The Silk Brocade Industry sent Luo Li-qin, Zhang Hong-sun, and other two people. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce added Wang Yan-song, and the Chinese Industrial Federation added Qian Cheng-xu, for a total of nine people traveling to Beijing together. They are scheduled to stay at the Central Hotel and plan to visit the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, and the Central Party Headquarters the next day to meet with officials. They will personally present the recent plight of the silk weaving and silk brocade industries, requesting assistance and a prompt refund of the artificial silk import tax to reduce costs and hopefully revive the industries. The petition document is copied below:</p>
<p>A petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce states: "We submit this petition concerning the disastrous decline of the Chinese silk trade, which has almost disappeared from foreign markets. Both the silk weaving and sales industries are experiencing unbearable hardship. We respectfully present the situation and jointly petition for your review and approval. We earnestly request a prompt refund of the artificial silk import tax to help rescue the industry and maintain foreign trade. Since the imposition of the artificial silk import tax last August, the export of artificial silk fabrics and artificial silk blended fabrics woven by our country's silk weaving factories to foreign markets such as Nanyang and India has been greatly affected. In the year 1929, the total export value of Chinese silk was 18 million taels of silver. After the imposition of the artificial silk tax in 1931, it had already decreased by 50%. Last year, another artificial silk import tax was levied at 15 customs gold units per picul, further increasing the cost of artificial silk fabrics by 5% to 15%. The price of silk also increased accordingly, and sales have further declined. To date, the sales of Chinese silk in Nanyang, India, and other places are only 20% to 30% of what they used to be. However, the only goods competing with Chinese silk are Japanese goods, which have lower costs and cheaper selling prices, so they are vigorously dumping their goods, causing Chinese silk to retreat. As a result, the amount of Chinese silk sold in Nanyang, India, and other places is extremely small, and the selling price is so low that it cannot even cover the cost. The reason is that Chinese silk merchants, in order to retain some international trade, have no choice but to endure the pain and sacrifice. Now, with only a glimmer of hope remaining, if prompt remedies are not taken, Chinese silk may suffer further losses and retreat, disappearing completely. Once it disappears, it will be difficult to recover. The principle of the artificial silk import tax was to maintain the low price of domestic natural silk. However, after implementation, not only has the domestic silk market not recovered, but the cost of silk fabrics has increased instead, affecting foreign trade and gradually reducing the export of Chinese silk. The loss of revenue from this export tax is already considerable. If no measures are taken to adjust the situation, we fear that the weakness of domestic silk will remain unchanged, while the decline of silk fabrics will worsen. This will inevitably affect tax revenue statistics. Moreover, in recent years, our country's industries have been beset by crises on all sides, ravaged by domestic disasters and wars, and plagued by the global economic panic, leading to overproduction and unemployment. The recent downturn in yarn factories is a clear example. The silk weaving industry has suffered greatly from national disasters since the beginning of last year, with losses of all kinds. To this day, its vitality has not recovered and is in constant danger. Therefore, we only hope to maintain costs and avoid losses, and to be able to pay wages to keep workers from losing their jobs. It can be seen that the current state of business is no different from working for others, a truly pitiful situation. However, recently, the silk sales market and foreign trade have become increasingly disastrous, and the domestic market is also being squeezed by foreign goods, causing prices to plummet. It is impossible to even maintain costs, and the losses are so great that the situation is extremely dangerous. If no measures are taken to help, the bankruptcy of the silk weaving and silk brocade industries will unfortunately follow the example of yarn factories. The above situation was reported on August 5th of last year by the Shanghai Electric Machine Silk Weaving Industry Association to the China International Trade Association, requesting that all artificial silk fabrics and artificial silk blended fabrics manufactured by domestic factories and exported to foreign countries be refunded the original amount of artificial silk import tax in order to reduce costs and aid foreign trade. Subsequently, we received a reply from the association stating that it had requested the Ministry of Finance to review and handle the matter. However, a long time has passed since then, and no approval has been granted. The raw materials for these exported silk fabrics are half artificial silk and half domestic silk. Since artificial silk has a wide range of uses, domestic silk can be promoted along with it. Directly, it is the export of artificial silk fabrics, but indirectly, it is finding a way out for natural silk. This is a win-win situation. Moreover, refunding the artificial silk import tax is not too troublesome for customs procedures. The customs can first print a special type of customs gold unit voucher for refunding the artificial silk import tax and fill in the amount to be refunded at any time. All domestic factories that export artificial silk fabrics for foreign trade should first register with the customs, detailing the name and composition of the goods so that they can be verified to prevent fraud. Then, when declaring and shipping the goods, the customs should verify that there are no errors and issue the customs gold unit voucher for the artificial silk import tax, allowing them to offset the full face value when paying the artificial silk import tax in the future. The process is simple and easy to implement and should be adopted. Furthermore, using raw materials from other countries to process and manufacture fabrics and export them abroad is a good opportunity to develop industry. Moreover, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce issued an industry plan in the previous year, which included a special clause stating that 'the consolidated tax on raw materials for exported goods shall be refunded upon export.' Now, the association feels that business is difficult and has repeatedly appealed for a refund of the artificial silk import tax. This is not an extravagant request, and the situation is indeed pitiful. If the cost of Chinese silk can be reduced, there will be a strong hope for the export of silk fabrics, and the sales of silk can be further boosted. After careful consideration, we dare to jointly submit this petition, hoping that you will review and approve it, and that you will take into account the current difficult situation and grant relief by promptly refunding the artificial silk import tax in order to reduce the cost of Chinese silk and maintain a lifeline of international trade. We submit this petition with fear and trembling, and we eagerly await your response."</p>
<p>The Petition Letter also states, "Respected Sirs, the decline of Chinese silk, the decreasing sales in Nanyang, India, and other places, and the impending bankruptcy of foreign trade are all due to the government's imposition of the artificial silk import tax, which has had a significant impact. The cost of silk fabrics has increased, and the selling price has increased, making it difficult to export them abroad and compete with the popular Japanese silk in those areas, which is a matter of course. In view of this, the association specially convened a joint meeting and decided that the two industries would send representatives to visit the Executive Yuan and the heads of various ministries and commissions, sincerely petitioning to maintain international trade, protect the silk weaving industry, and provide urgent relief. Please promptly refund the artificial silk import tax on exported fabrics. We are now jointly sending representatives from the two industries to petition. We respectfully request that you grant us an audience. We would be most grateful."</p>
<p>After the petition delegation arrives in Beijing, they will stay at the Central Hotel and carry out the petition work the next day.</p>
<h3>Yarn Factories in Raw Material Panic, US Cotton Dumping Threatens Future</h3>
<p>But the Practice of Mixing Damp Soil Cotton is a Suicide Policy</p>
<p>If Cotton Production is Not Improved Soon, All is Lost</p>
<p>The raw material cotton of Chinese and foreign yarn factories in this city is experiencing a shortage panic. When the municipal government and others met to discuss relief for Chinese yarn factories, it was decided to telegram Minister Song of the United States to find a solution. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned the following details from the Commodity Inspection Bureau yesterday:</p>
<p>General Situation of Cotton Production: Cotton is produced in various places in our country. The production volume in 1931 was 6,399,780 dan, and the production volume in 1932 was 8,100,563 dan. The cotton consumption of yarn factories nationwide was 8,159,968 dan in 1931 and 8,965,935 dan in 1932. During the global economic downturn, the United States is dumping cotton in China, resulting in domestic cotton prices being less competitive than US cotton. In addition, domestic cotton is inconvenient to transport and of uneven quality, which makes it greatly affected by US cotton.</p>
<p>The practice of mixing damp soil cotton into cotton imported into our country is becoming increasingly widespread. This bad habit is damaging the quality of cotton and hindering the textile process. As a result, Chinese yarn factories are increasingly using US cotton. In 1932, the import of foreign cotton was 3,712,856 dan. Domestic cotton urgently needs to be improved, otherwise it will be affected by foreign cotton and its market price will be manipulated by foreign cotton. Today, various provinces are deeply aware of this and are working to promote the cultivation of good cotton by purchasing US seeds and distributing them to farmers.</p>
<p>Dumping is Worrying: Due to the impact of the situation and the high cost, the production of domestic cotton has decreased. This year, the market launch of US cotton will be in October, and the market launch of domestic cotton will be in September. During this transition period, a shortage panic has occurred, and the existing cotton is not enough for one month's use. However, US cotton has been continuously shipped to Shanghai, so there is no major problem for yarn factories. However, the exemption of import duties on foreign cotton is absolutely unacceptable. Since Chinese and Japanese factories are half of the country's total yarn factories, if import duties are exempted, domestic cotton will inevitably be hit harder. The dumping of foreign cotton will only benefit the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying Cables Thanks to the Volunteer Army Support Association</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a reply cable from Sun Dianying yesterday, which stated: "I have respectfully received your cable. The entire army is grateful for your repeated donations. We are deeply grateful for your donation of 2,000 yuan this time. In addition to publishing a thank you in the newspaper, I am sending this cable to thank you first. Sun Kuiyuan, East Seal."</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Seven Types of Government Bonds to be Drawn Regularly for Principal Repayment</h3>
<p>At the Bankers' Association on the Morning of the 10th of this Month</p>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, the Ministry of Finance has issued the 10th Military Short-Term Government Bonds, the 14th 10-Year 6% Government Bonds, the 14th 14-Year 8% Government Bonds, the 13th Post-War Government Bonds, the 12th 1929 Disaster Relief Government Bonds, the 10th 1930 Customs Revenue Government Bonds, and the 10th Austrian Compensation 24 Treasury Bills. The Ministry of Finance's Government Bond Audit Office has confirmed that the lottery for the above seven types of government bonds will be held at 10:00 AM on October 10th at the Bankers' Association on Hong Kong Road. Letters have been sent to various agencies and legal entities to attend and supervise the lottery. The rumor that the seven types of government bonds would be drawn yesterday morning at 10:00 AM is inaccurate.</p>

<h3>Health Bureau Announces Causes and Prevention of Seasonal Diseases</h3>
<p>Including Cholera, Dysentery, Typhoid Fever, Malaria, Heatstroke, etc.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau recently attached great importance to summer epidemic prevention, as the summer season is approaching. To enable citizens to understand the sources and transmission of various summer seasonal diseases so as to prevent them, it specially announced the causes and prevention methods of various seasonal diseases yesterday, which are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cholera: Cholera is also known as Huo Luo Sha or Diaojiao Sha. It is easily transmitted through raw water or direct contact with the vomit and excrement of patients. The prevention method is to be careful with food and drink and to practice summer hygiene. It is best to get a preventive injection first. If the disease has already started, send the patient to the hospital for treatment as soon as possible and inject saline solution. The sooner the better, as delay may be fatal. Seriously disinfect the clothes, bedding, utensils, and other items that have been vomited or excreted by the patient. Wash your hands after contacting the patient. The main symptoms of cholera are excessive vomiting and diarrhea. The excrement is like rice water, without abdominal pain, cold limbs, sunken eye sockets, prominent cheekbones, skin that does not easily return to its original state when pinched, sunken finger joints, and cramps in the leg tendons.</p>
<p>Dysentery: Anyone who contracts dysentery will first have a fever, abdominal pain before bowel movements, urgency and tenesmus during bowel movements, small amount of bowel movements with frequent bowel movements, and excretion of mucus or bloody stools. There is a tender, cord-like area in the lower left abdomen. The transmission situation is the same as cholera. The prevention method is to pay attention to diet, practice the first seven items of summer hygiene, seek medical treatment for patients, and disinfect the patient's stool, clothes, bedding, and utensils. Wash your hands after contacting the patient.</p>
<p>Typhoid Fever: Typhoid fever is also known as enteric fever. The pathogen is typhoid bacillus, which is transmitted through raw water and flies in the patient's stool and urine. Its symptoms last for more than three weeks, including a long-lasting fever, a candle-colored tongue coating, delirium, unclear consciousness, a red rash on the chest and abdomen resembling bowl juice, constipation or diarrhea. The prevention method is similar to that of cholera and dysentery.</p>
<p>Malaria: Malaria is also known as cold and heat disease. People in the north call it Dabai disease. It is originally transmitted by mosquitoes. Its symptoms include periodic fever, either once a day or once every two days. Generally, it first starts with chills, then fever, and finally sweating and fever reduction, followed by recurrence, or it may be irregular. The main points of prevention are to implement hygiene points 8 and 9 and to take 1 gram of quinine every four days during the mosquito season, or 15% of a gram every day. When the disease starts, seek medical treatment immediately and do not delay.</p>
<p>Heatstroke: Also known as heatstroke or sunstroke, it is caused by prolonged exposure to strong sunlight or high heat, which causes congestion in the brain. Its symptoms include a red face, hot skin, headache, blurred vision, dizziness, tinnitus, loss of consciousness, and fainting. It can be prevented by not working or traveling in strong sunlight or high heat for long periods of time. If the disease has already started, quickly move the patient to a shady place, loosen their clothes, pour cool boiled water or tea into the patient's mouth, and place a cold towel or cold compress on the head. At the same time, seek medical treatment from a doctor.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Arrests a Long-Standing Kidnapping Bandit</h3>
<p>Both a Cobbler and a Kidnapper</p>
<p>Demanding Money Raised Suspicion and Led to Arrest</p>
<p>Du Hanwen, Zhang Zhu-shi, and Others Scattered</p>
<p>Kidnapper Du Hanwen, nicknamed Du Damazi, 36 years old, is from Zhenjiang and also works as a cobbler. He used to run a cobbler stall at the entrance of Shipilong in Nanjing. Due to repeated crimes, he could not stand firm and fled to Shanghai last year, hiding in Pudong. He continued his old business in a certain leather workshop. Recently, the workshop closed down, and Du moved to Puxi. He learned that his former colleague Xu Mingyi was also living in Shanghai, at No. 82, Pingmin Residence, Jiaotong Road, Zhabei. Du went to find him and asked him to introduce him to a job. On April 23rd, Xu introduced Du to Han Hengyi's leather workshop at No. 5, Shunxing Lane, Wuzhen Road, as an apprentice. However, Han did not know that Du was a bandit specializing in kidnapping. When Du was in Nanjing, he became acquainted with a female kidnapper, Zhang Zhu-shi, from Chongming, who lived next door. She was 34 years old and her husband, from Nanjing, was nicknamed Nanjing Lao San. She now lives on the third floor of the fried noodle shop at No. 66, Mantingfang, Wuhu Road, Public Concession. She learned that Du was in Zhabei and went to visit him from time to time, taking the opportunity to ask Du to find a girl nearby. She promised that after getting the price, they would divide it equally. From May 3rd to 5th, Zhang Zhu-shi went to Du's place twice. After that, she went almost every day. On May 8th, Du saw that the four-year-old girl, Feng, of Yang Zhou-shi, a woman from Yangzhou at No. 6, Shunxing Lane, was playing at the entrance of the lane. Seeing an opportunity, he arranged with Zhang Zhu-shi to wait at the entrance of the lane that afternoon. Du managed to carry the girl out and hand her over to Zhang Zhu-shi, who quickly hired a rickshaw to hide her in Mantingfang. That day, He Zhao-shi saw that her beloved daughter was suddenly missing and quickly sent people out to inquire. Later, neighbors reported that they had seen her daughter being carried by a cobbler from a leather workshop next door. She went to the leather workshop to inquire, but only Du had left without saying goodbye. Thus, He Zhao-shi was sure that Du was involved and reported to the Fourth District General Office together with the owner of the leather workshop, Han Hengyi, requesting investigation. District Chief Lai assigned police detectives to search for Du. After Zhang Zhu-shi hid He's daughter, she searched for customers but found none. At the same time, Du, unemployed and struggling to make a living, went to Zhang's place to ask for his reward from time to time. Zhang Zhu-shi always told him to wait, and did not let the girl meet Du. Du became suspicious, thinking that Zhang was keeping all the money for herself, and secretly went to the First District General Office in Nanshi to report that kidnapper Zhang Zhu-shi had kidnapped a girl from Zhabei and was hiding her in the concession. After checking with the Fourth District, the district informed the Fourth District General Office that the case seemed to be related to the case that occurred in the Fourth District. District Chief Lai assigned Inspector Mu Chengjin to lead detectives to Zhang's residence. They first detained Du Hanwen, and after questioning him, he confessed to the above. After checking Zhang Zhu-shi's location, which was in the concession, they prepared a document and went with the Central Police to arrest Zhang Zhu-shi at the fried noodle shop on the third floor of No. 66, Mantingfang. They found He's daughter and escorted her back to the Fourth District General Office with Du Hanwen. After questioning by Inspector Mu, Zhang confessed to colluding with Du and revealed that she and others had committed kidnapping crimes in Shanghai many times. She claimed that in the spring of last year, they had kidnapped a three- or four-year-old girl named Fang Jin and a four-year-old girl named Chen Liang, and sold them to a person named Yin at No. 17, Youzhi Lane, Machine Factory Street, Nantaotou for 50 yuan. In March of this year, a girl of eight years old was brought by a fruit seller at the entrance of Yideli, Six Malu. She entrusted a small tailor upstairs at the Laohuzao in Jiumudi to sell the girl to Wang Mazi's family in Xiaonanmen, French Concession, for 89 yuan. On May 4th of this year, her husband, Chen Liang, Mao Asi, and a person surnamed Sha jointly kidnapped an eighteen-year-old woman who has been transported by boat to Fujian for sale and will return to Shanghai soon. In addition, there are still a large number of accomplices scattered everywhere as cobblers. After verifying the confession, the inspector believed that the bandits dared to traffic in human beings, which was extremely illegal. He temporarily detained Du Hanwen and Zhang Zhu-shi and reported the case to District Chief Lai, who forwarded it to the Public Security Bureau, assigning detectives to secretly arrest the accomplices according to the addresses provided by Zhang and Du. At the same time, personnel were dispatched to guard the various wharves and ports to arrest Chen Liang and others, so that they could be reported and dealt with according to the law.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Chinese Paper-Making Association</h3>
<p>The Chinese Paper-Making Research Association, which was previously organized by Chinese students who studied paper-making in Europe, has decided to expand its organization and invite all paper-making colleagues and engineers from various paper mills to meet at the China News Agency on Weihaiwei Road the day before yesterday. The association will be reorganized into the Chinese Paper-Making Association, amend the articles of association, elect staff, and move the address to Shanghai in order to strive to develop the paper-making industry in our country. It is also reported that the association's communication address is temporarily set at No. 70, Shanfuli, Liujia Lane, Shanzhong Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Li Guojie's Verdict Yesterday</h3>
<p>Sentenced to Three Years and Six Months in Prison and Ordered to Pay 700,000 in Compensation</p>
<p>Li Appeals to the Supreme Court</p>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, was charged with mortgaging the company's wharf to the China Business Corporation and losing shipping rights, and bribing Chen Fumu with 700,000 taels. After the Minister of Transportation reported the case, it was sent to the Shanghai District Court. Li Guojie was found guilty of breach of trust and sentenced to two years in prison, and sentenced to two years in prison for bribery, with the sentences to be served concurrently for a total of three years in prison, deprivation of civil rights for five years, and confiscation of the 700,000 taels of bribes. Li refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Jiangsu High Court. The presiding judge of the First Criminal Tribunal came to Shanghai to hear the case at the Shanghai District Court. The debate ended on the fourth day, and the verdict was scheduled to be announced on June 5. After the presiding judge Lin Zhechang and the assessors Fang Wensiwen deliberated, they decided that it was necessary to change the criminal law and went to Suzhou to inform Dean Lin, who agreed. They returned to Shanghai with the judgment. Yesterday morning at 11:00 AM, the presiding judge, the assessors, the clerk, and the prosecutor Zhan Guifen opened the First Tribunal to announce the verdict. Li Guojie, 53 years old, from Hefei, Anhui, residing at No. 1050, Xiafei Road, was brought to the court for questioning. The presiding judge stood up and read the main text of the verdict, which overturned the original verdict. Li Guojie, as a third party, illegally occupied property owned by others and was sentenced to three years and six months in prison and deprived of civil rights for five years. The remaining part was not guilty. Li Guojie should compensate the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company 700,000 taels, with interest at 8% per annum from February 8th of this year, the date on which the administrative meeting approved the recall, and the civil suit portion was subject to provisional enforcement. The reasons were briefly stated as follows: breach of trust is still being prosecuted, so he is not guilty. However, the crime of giving 700,000 to Chen Fumu is very clear. He used the company's funds to pay a third party, so the crime of embezzlement is very suitable, and the crime of bribery is a continuation of the crime, so he is sentenced to one charge. As for the 700,000 taels, you are a general manager and should compensate. But if there is no provisional enforcement, the property may be hidden in the future, so we declare provisional enforcement. Li refused to accept the verdict and was advised that he could appeal to the Supreme Court within ten days. He then left the court.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Ministry of Industry's Alcohol Factory</h3>

<h3>Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Relieves Jiangwan Disaster Victims</h3>
<p>Allocates Over 10,000 Yuan as Loan Capital for the Residents</p>
<p>Jiangwan suffered the most severely in the Songhu Anti-Japanese War. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau specially handled loans for the construction of houses to help the poor residents of the area, limiting the loans to extremely poor households who were genuinely unable to build houses and were living in the open or living with relatives. The program has been quite successful since its implementation. However, in May, there were still over 600 disaster victims who went to the Jiangwan District Municipal Committee Office to request relief. The office immediately agreed to register them and forwarded the request to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. In order to provide relief to the disaster victims in the area, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has specially transferred the remaining funds of 13,200 yuan from the Jiangwan District housing construction to be used as loan capital for the poor residents and farmers in the area. It has ordered the Jiangwan District Municipal Committee Office to handle the loans in accordance with the regulations of the War Zone Rehabilitation Committee.</p>
<h3>YWCA Initiates Professional Women's Association</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YWCA, in view of the fact that there are many women in this city who serve the community but are like "a heap of loose sand" lacking the opportunity for unity, resulting in an inability to achieve consistency and a lack of mutual understanding, believes that active work is necessary. Since moving to No. 8C, Yuanyuan Road, it has joined with professional women to initiate the organization of a professional women's association. The purpose is to raise the status of women, promote noble entertainment, discuss women's issues, study knowledge, cultivate morality, and connect feelings. Regulations are being drafted and members are being sought. It is hoped that all women in legitimate professions will respond and enthusiastically participate, and then elect staff from among the members to formally establish the association. It is reported that there will be recreational activities at each meeting, and there will also be mutual assistance in job referrals in the future, which is good news for the women's community.</p>
<h3>Satisfactory Conclusion of the Nursery Charity Ball</h3>
<p>The Nursery Charity Ball held by the Chinese Nursery Association was hosted the other day by Ms.斐美德 at the Cathay Hotel. Invited to the gathering were Mayor Wu, Mei Lanfang, Xu Jianping, Yan Siqiao, Fei Wusheng, and dozens of preparation committee members. After dinner, the hostess reported that the ball raised a net profit of 18,000 yuan after expenses, all of which would be used for the Nursery Association's promotional activities. Furthermore, the association recognized Ms.斐's contributions to childcare, which were as high as a mountain and as long as a river, for her more than 40 years in China, during which she had educated over 6,000 children. Therefore, a large silver incense burner with commemorative inscriptions was specially made and presented to her publicly by Mayor Wu to express respect. Guests and hosts parted in joy.</p>
<h3>Golden Goblet Champagne Ticket Won by Indian and Others from the Special Court</h3>
<p>The Golden Goblet Champagne ticket for disaster relief for victims in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei provinces was drawn on the third day of this month. The first prize, ticket number 62151, worth 340,000 yuan, was sold by the Sincere Company's sales outlet. The purchaser was an Indian named 印大星 (transliteration). This Indian is a translator who has to work as an interpreter at the First Special District Court every day. He knows many of the court officials and lawyers. Since the Golden Goblet Champagne tickets went on sale, he has been raising funds by pooling resources. Remarkably, he managed to raise hundreds of yuan and bought ten consecutive tickets from Sincere. However, his enthusiasm was still strong, and he continued to raise funds to buy another ten tickets. The winning ticket, 62151, was among the first ten tickets. Therefore, the shareholders who invested the second time could not share the prize money. Those who had a share in the first round all made a huge profit. The people involved include about seven or eight types of individuals, namely judicial police, court clerks, public servants, Hua detectives who deliver case files, translators, public lawyers, and lawyers practicing independently. Therefore, the number of people is quite large. Each person contributed a maximum of five yuan and a minimum of five jiao, with one or two yuan being the most common contribution. 印大星, who handled the purchase, had a share of one yuan and five jiao. Currently, the majority of the shareholders have decided that once the prize money is received, it will be distributed according to the percentage of shares, that is, each yuan of share money will receive 3,400 yuan in prize money. It is truly fortunate.</p>
<h3>A Scene of Domestic Scandal</h3>
<p>Son Captures Adultery on Camera as Evidence</p>
<p>Blind Old Father Living a Chaotic Life</p>
<p>In the 육家宅 area of Pudong, a rare case of catching adultery occurred the night before last. The son, together with his mother-in-law, caught his own mother and her lover together. The circumstances are extremely complicated. The cause and effect of this case are explored and recorded below:</p>
<p>Family Corruption</p>
<p>There is a man from Shaoxing named Tian Changshou, who is 59 years old. He runs a bathhouse called 长清池 on 北塘 Road, 육家宅, Pudong. The business is doing well. Tian's first wife died early. His current wife, 陈氏 (48 years old), is from the same hometown as Tian. She was previously married to Xu Fusheng. They lived together for several years and had a son. Later, due to disagreements, they divorced. At the age of twenty-three, she remarried Tian with her son as his stepson. Tian treated the son as his own, named him Fuqing, and raised him to adulthood. He helped him marry and start a family. Fuqing is now 26 years old and has a son and a daughter. After Tian and 陈氏 lived together, they also had a son, who is only sixteen or seventeen years old and still in school. However, 陈氏 is nearing fifty but her coquettishness has not diminished. On the contrary, Tian is honest by nature, and has recently gone blind for three years. In order to facilitate finding extramarital affairs, he spent money to purchase a nineteen-year-old girl named Hehua as a concubine for her husband. 陈氏 voluntarily vacated the room to sleep alone, as she had other plans to deceive her husband. This is the corrupt situation of Tian's family.</p>
<p>Feud Between Two Women</p>
<p>Fuqing's mother-in-law, Wang Zhangshi, is currently 43 years old and is from Ningbo. She rents a place at No. 29, 典当 衖, Pudong, and makes a living by doing hairdressing for others. Therefore, others call her "梳头娘姨" (hairdressing nanny). Zhangshi had two daughters, the elder of whom is Fuqing's wife. After the two families became related through marriage, their relationship was very close. Soon after, they betrothed the younger daughter, Xingmei, to 陈氏's younger son. They were engaged at the age of nine, and Xingmei lived in Tian's house as an adopted daughter-in-law. Xingmei is now fifteen years old and is very beautiful. However, she often returns to her mother's home to live, and does not return for several days. Chen氏 feared that Xingmei might have an accident, so she seriously negotiated with her in-laws, Zhangshi, wanting to prevent Xingmei from moving. Zhangshi knew that 陈氏 herself was restless, so she retorted back. Chen氏 became angry and ashamed, and immediately filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting that Zhangshi be ordered to prevent her daughter from returning home. After questioning both parties, the judge announced that there was no legal prohibition against an adopted daughter-in-law returning to her mother's home for a short stay. 陈氏, seeing that her goal was not achieved, blamed Zhangshi even more. This is the origin of the feud between the two in-laws, which is also related to the occurrence of this case.</p>
<p>Photography as Evidence</p>
<p>After 陈氏 purchased a concubine for her husband, she secretly had an affair. She became involved with Li Shaotong, a former policeman from Anhui, who is 46 years old and physically strong. 陈氏 openly brought Li home to spend the night, providing him with food and clothing, and supporting him with money. Fuqing heard and saw this, and watched as the family property was being squandered by his mother. The 长清池 bathhouse was also unable to maintain itself and was rented out to others. His father was blind and incapable. If this continued, the consequences would be unimaginable. Therefore, he discussed countermeasures with his mother-in-law. Zhangshi and Chen氏 originally had a feud, but for the sake of her daughter and son-in-law's future, she felt that it was necessary to help. Therefore, regardless of everything, she was determined to catch the adultery. The plan was set. The night before last, Li came to 陈氏's bedroom for a clandestine meeting. Fuqing and Zhangshi gathered many people without making a sound, broke into Chen氏's bedroom, and caught the adulterer and adulteress together. They forced the two to lie naked on one bed, and instructed the photographer who had been called in advance to take a picture as evidence. Then, Fuqing accompanied his father to the nearby police station of the Fourth District and reported that Tian was accusing his wife and Li Shaotong of adultery and disrupting the family. Captain Yuan then led a team, arrested the couple, and took them to the Third District Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>Investigation Process</p>
<p>Director Zhang of the district separately interrogated the plaintiffs and defendants. According to Tian, he had not heard of his wife's misconduct until after the adultery was caught. He requested an investigation. According to the statements of Tian Fuqing and Chen氏, because the in-law Zhangshi had a bad relationship with me, she invited thirty or forty people to come to my room to make trouble. Li Shaotong happened to be asking me for a loan, and we were tied up and accused of adultery. We were forced to take off our clothes and photographed as an insult. I request justice for this great humiliation. Li Shaotong stated that he was formerly a police officer in the Fourth Squad and is now a peddler in 顾林 bridge. Today, he was asking Chen氏 for a loan and was suddenly falsely accused of adultery. He was wronged. Director Zhang, considering that Wang Zhangshi participated in catching the adultery, ordered her to be brought in for questioning. According to her statement, she did not know about catching the adultery. However, after the fact, Tian Changshou gave me two yuan and asked me to reason with Tian's wife, Chen氏. Because the mutual resolution did not go down, Tian reported the case to the authorities for investigation. The rest I do not know. Director Zhang ordered that the group be sent to the District Court for a ruling yesterday morning.</p>

<h3>January 28th Chartering Lawsuit Awaiting Verdict</h3>
<p>In March of the year before last, Dalu Coal Company chartered the Yunlong ship from Heng'an Chengji Shipping Company to transport coal, entrusting Yuchang Coal Company to manage it for a term of one year at a monthly rent of 8,500 yuan. Later, due to a dispute over rent and the Shanghai War of Resistance on January 28th, it was very dangerous for ships to enter and exit the Wusongkou. The charterer requested to terminate the lease. The two parties had different claims, so Heng'an hired lawyer Cai Rudong to sue Dalu and Yuchang, the principals of Xie Yunqi, for ship rent and compensation for losses, totaling more than 10,000 yuan. The two coal companies then hired lawyers Yang Linzhi, Zhang Jiahui, and Ye San to file a defense, refuting each of the plaintiff's claims layer by layer. Regarding the fact that the ship could not sail due to the outbreak of war, leading to early termination of the lease, they cited more facts at the time and various interpretations of war by Chinese and foreign legal scholars, determining that the January 28th incident did indeed constitute an act of war. According to the chartering contract, the defendant had the right to claim cancellation of the charter. In conclusion, they said that not only did the defendant not owe the plaintiff money, but the plaintiff actually owed the defendant 1,820 yuan, and the plaintiff's lawsuit should be rejected. After repeated trials by judge Shen Hong of the civil court of the First Special District Court, and reported in the previous newspaper, Judge Shen continued to summon the defendant's lawyer, Yang Linzhi, yesterday afternoon, and further clarified the relationship between the defendant, Xie Yunqi, and Dalu and Yuchang, stating that although Yuchang was solely funded by Xie, Dalu was only a shareholder. Lawyer Yang then presented several newspapers to prove that during the fierce fighting in Shanghai last year, the Japanese army bombarded Wusong merchant ships, and sailing was absolutely dangerous. The various shipping companies in the city had temporarily suspended sailing. Seeing that the evidence from both sides had been submitted successively, and the content of the case had been investigated and clarified, he ordered the start of oral debate. As a result, the two lawyers Cai and Yang debated according to reason and by eloquent for an hour before stopping. Judge Shen ordered a adjournment and set a date for sentencing.</p>
<h3>Police Officer Accidentally Shoots Rice Store Employee</h3>
<p>Di Fuxiao, a patrol officer with number 2350 of the Fourth District Public Security Bureau in Zhabei, was on duty at the Xinza Bridge pier at 4:20 PM yesterday when he accidentally pulled the trigger while cleaning his gun in front of the Zhengchanghe Rice Store at number 14 there. With a loud bang, it shot into the rice store. At that time, Zhou Zhangwen, a clerk in the store, 35 years old from Tongzhou, was sitting on a rice bag when the bullet entered Zhou's right leg. He bled and fell to the ground. After seeing the accident, the officer immediately handed the pistol over to the neighboring post and hired a rickshaw to send the injured person to the Pushan Hospital on Xinmin Road for treatment. After the doctor examined it, the bullet had entered the leg bone, and the bullet could not be taken out with an instrument, so only a bandage was applied. The Fire Brigade then sent him to the Renji Hospital in 맥가圈 in the concession by ambulance for treatment. Fortunately, the injury was in the leg and was probably not life-threatening, but the leg bone had been damaged, and there was a risk of disability. The police officer who caused the accident is currently in the custody of the Fourth District and will be sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Indian Who Committed a Crime Two Years Ago Apprehended</h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that three years ago, an Indian named 泰泰辛 helped an Indian named 查南辛 escape from the hands of the police. The British Attorney General's Office issued an arrest warrant. Yesterday, the Public Concession Police received a report that two Indians were watching a movie at the Golden Horse Theater on Avenue Edward VII. West detectives Moore and Pride, together with a French detective, 卜可夫, waited at the theater door. At 11:05 PM, when the movie ended and the Indian left the theater, Moore and a Chinese detective stepped forward to arrest 泰泰辛. He resisted and was immediately arrested. Pride and 杜卜可夫 held the Indian 那閘辛, who was helping him resist arrest. In a split second, he broke free. The two pursued him. 那閘辛 took out a gun and fired, wounding 杜卜可夫 in the skull. He also fired a shot at Pride and the police driver who was helping with the chase. Because there were many people on the road, it was not convenient to return fire, and he escaped. Although one person was arrested at the time, it was immediately found that he was the Indian policeman 富匣辛, who was helping the arrest, and not 那閘辛, who opened fire and resisted arrest, so he was released. After 杜卜可夫 was injured, he was immediately sent to the Cathay Road Police Station and then to the hospital. It is said that the bullet fortunately did not enter the skull and the injury was not serious. The "Shanghai Evening Post" reported that the Indian 泰泰辛 was taken to the British Police Court this morning and charged with helping 查南辛 escape from the hands of the police two and a half years ago. The defendant pleaded guilty. After inquiring about the circumstances of the arrest, the hearing was adjourned to Friday.</p>

<p>City News: Domestically Produced Mercerized Soap Emerges. The glossy soaps used in China used to all be Japanese products. Recently, the Zhonghe Soap Factory, after a long period of research, invented a top-grade domestically produced mercerized soap, made entirely of vegetable fats such as coconut oil, peanut kernels, cottonseed oil, and linseed oil. Each percentage contains 77.0% combined fat and 8.8% combined alkali. There is 14.2% crystalline water and no free fat or free alkali. Because ordinary soap contains free fat, its cleaning power is weak, and containing free alkali often harms the materials being washed. This soap is saponified to an appropriate degree, is neutral in nature, and has no such drawbacks. Moreover, it decomposes very easily and does not stick together or dissolve unevenly, so that the concentration of its solution is inconsistent, and the washed materials are therefore not evenly cleaned. It is extremely suitable for washing rayon, silk, cotton yarn, wool yarn, etc. After washing, dirt and grime are completely removed, and the fibers are soft and easily absorb various dyes, and it also has a bleaching effect. Its functions are definitely superior to Japanese soap, and the price is one-third cheaper. Therefore, various refining factories have already adopted it. All department stores in this city sell it for washing silk clothes, and it will not turn yellow, making it very suitable for summer use.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Education Association Announces "One-One" Education Movement Declaration</h3>
<p>China's Illnesses are Ignorance, Weakness, Selfishness, and Poverty</p>
<p>Popular Education is the Foundation for Curing Illnesses</p>
<p>Donate One Yuan to Let One Person Read for One Month</p>
<p>Donate Four Yuan to Cultivate One Person to Graduate</p>
<p>The Shanghai Education Association yesterday issued a One Yuan One Month Education Movement declaration, stating that China's illnesses are "ignorance," "weakness," "selfishness," and "poverty." To make the ignorant intelligent, to make the weak strong, to make the selfish public-minded, and to make the poor rich, the basic method is education. China has a population of 470 million, and 85% of the total population, about 407.5 million, have not received national education. In other words, only 15 out of 100 Chinese people have read books, while 85 have not. Under these circumstances, how can the Chinese nation not be ignorant, not be weak, not be selfish, not be poor? If they are ignorant, weak, selfish, and poor, how can the Republic of China not be a colony, and how can the Chinese not be slaves to a conquered nation? To make the ignorant intelligent, to make the weak strong, to make the selfish public-minded, and to make the poor rich, how can we not promote education, how can we not promote popular education?</p>
<p>Popular education is the education of adult men and women, and it is the basic method to defeat ignorance, weakness, selfishness, and poverty. Because popular education includes four kinds of education: 1) literacy education, 2) health education, 3) civic education, and 4) livelihood education. Literacy education can defeat ignorance, health education can defeat weakness, civic education can defeat selfishness, and livelihood education can defeat poverty. If literacy education is successful, the people can transform ignorance into intelligence. If health education is successful, the people can transform weakness into strength. If civic education is successful, the people can transform selfishness into public-mindedness. If livelihood education is successful, the people can transform poverty into wealth. If they are intelligent, strong, public-minded, and rich, why worry about the society not being rich and the country not being strong? Will China still be bullied by foreigners? Therefore, popular education is simply a basic work of saving the country. If we want to save the country, we must strive to promote popular education.</p>
<p>There are many ways to conduct popular education, such as establishing popular schools, holding popular lectures, printing popular reading materials, establishing cooperatives, popular libraries, popular education centers, popular sports fields, and popular teahouses, and improving storytelling venues, among which the most effective is popular schools. Popular schools can run the above-mentioned four types of education, but who is willing to lose money to run such popular schools? The government? The government is now facing financial difficulties, and it is difficult to maintain existing large, medium, and small schools. How can it have the surplus power to run popular schools? Looking at Shanghai, the total education funding for Shanghai in 1932 was 1.22 million yuan, while the funding for popular education (including sports fields and popular education centers, etc.) was only 68,892 yuan, accounting for about 5.6% of the total, with only 5,731 yuan per month (according to the Ministry of Education statistics). This sum of money cannot create many students even if it is completely used to run popular schools, not to mention that most of it is still used in other undertakings. Therefore, in fact, only the people themselves can run popular schools.</p>
<p>This association is a general collection of large, medium, and small schools in Shanghai, and it is the central organization of the Shanghai education community. We dare not abandon this important responsibility. We intend to pave the way for the people and take the lead in promoting this educational movement to supplement the government's deficiencies. Because the expenses for running popular schools, including the books, paper, pens, and daily expenses given to students, as well as teacher allowances, cost about one yuan per student per month on average. And donating one yuan can cultivate a fellow citizen to read for one month, so it is named the "One Yuan One Month Education Movement." This association vows to use the most economical and open methods to allocate funds, and to run schools in the most practical and effective ways.</p>
<p>Wealthy gentlemen, donate one yuan to cultivate a fellow citizen to read for one month, and donate four yuan to cultivate a fellow citizen to graduate. We hope that everyone will work together and actively participate in this great meritorious deed of saving the country and seeking the welfare of the people.</p>
<h3>Speeches by Universities in East China Held at Jinan University</h3>
<p>The first speech competition of the East China University Speech and Debate Association will be held at National Jinan University in Zhenru today and tomorrow. It is reported that the school is extremely welcoming as it is the first time it has been its turn to host. Representatives from Jinda, Jinan Women's University, Soochow, and Central University have all arrived in Shanghai. Jinan University has specially appointed Zhou Guangwu and others as receptionists, and has designated Fangsheng Road Jiande Xu Hui as the accommodation location for male speakers, while female speakers will stay in the school's girls' dormitory. Also, the president of the school, Zheng Hongnian, specially wrote a welcome essay, which is very elegant. The full text is recorded below. The universities in East China will hold their first speech competition in the Zhiyuan Hall of our school on June 6, 1933. At this time, the reeds are fresh and the willows are slender, watching the swallows fly. The parasol trees are green and the gardenias are fat, trying the harmonious language of the orioles. The source of words in the Three Gorges will overflow in Tan Ying, and the embroidered characters will be marked, hoping to grind them to help the country. The Jinan school is serving as the host, and the good wind comes from the distant fields. Hongnian is the head of Nanyong, and the new moon comes to peep into the same dormitory. People come from afar, comparing themselves to the light of the country, and the purpose is very beautiful, fortunately attached to the joy of swimming in the Sui. I respectfully compose a poem to welcome them. The Dragon Boat Festival is over, and the wormwood is stopped. Looking back at the predecessors, the clouds are far away, and worries and sorrows are traced back. The words are not too much to be repeated, and there is no time to mourn in many laments. Alone among the sons, they speak eloquently and generously. The parting sorrow is given, and the magnificent name is in the field. How can they not sing loudly and look up to the sky, trying to lift up for you with two green eyes. Dare to share the same spirit, and the sharpness can destroy the strong. I believe that talent is unimpeded, and I don't have time to think about it. Entering the school, the Zheng people comment on whether it is right or wrong. Why not take the seat to talk about the scriptures? Taking into account the world's respect for future generations, worshiping Yan Chang, cherishing the seats, and achieving the display of Gui Zhang. The talented people show their talents, and they must pay attention to behavior and promote scholarship.</p>

<h3>Peiming Girls' Middle School Holds a Social Gathering</h3>
<p>Principal Jin Yuezhang of Maigen Road Peiming Girls' Middle School has worked hard to rectify the school affairs, which are developing day by day. The original school building has long been felt to be insufficient for application. After repeated attempts, two large Western-style houses at 210 Maigen Road, near the original school building, were rented last month, with gardens, lawns, rockeries, ancient trees, fish ponds, and pavilions and pavilions. The equipment is in place. At 1:00 p.m. yesterday, a social gathering of teachers and students was held in front of the new school building to commemorate the relocation and to send off the graduating students. Xie Xunchu, the director of the school, and more than 300 teachers and students attended the event, performing new dramas, singing and dancing, and other entertainment.</p>

<p>Today is June 6, Teacher's Day</p>
<h3>Teacher's Day Address to Pan Gongzhan</h3>
<p>Considering the teachers' hard work and mission in education, it certainly cannot be repaid or fully expressed by just one day of commemoration. However, we cannot ignore this festival, and we must further recognize the encouragement it gives us.</p>
<p>Speaking of "teachers," they have always been respected in our society. The so-called "Heaven, Earth, Monarch, Parent, and Teacher" was indeed a feudal form with little significance, but it also shows the society's emphasis on "teachers." However, in recent years, due to the decline of our country's "inherent morality" and under the superficial academic atmosphere, the so-called "teacher's way" has become merely a historical laudation without any special development.</p>
<p>Naturally, the decline of "teacher's way" is partly due to the negligence of the students, but also partly due to the teachers' own neglect. There used to be a saying, "If teaching is not strict, it is the teacher's laziness." Of course, we don't expect every teacher to put on a stern face and pretend to be "majestic and respected." But I ask, how many teachers now can teach well enough to be respected by students, and what percentage do they account for in the entire teaching body? Therefore, on this "Teacher's Day," I feel that there is much to say from the perspective of the meaning of "teacher."</p>
<p>"Teacher" naturally does not mean that students should regard teachers as gods, but at least we must make students understand why a teacher is a teacher. As for the teachers themselves, they cannot take being "respected" as their due right, but students should have this obligation towards good teachers. This is the first point of significance.</p>
<p>The reason a teacher is a teacher lies in their ability to use their teaching skills well. If they are incompetent, they will not only "mislead people" but also "mislead the country." How can such teachers be respected? Therefore, on this Teacher's Day, every teacher should reflect on and encourage themselves, review the past, and set a goal for the future. This is the second point of significance.</p>
<p>Speaking of teaching methods, we naturally cannot deny that new education is more scientific. But upon closer examination, our country's old teaching methods also have unique strengths that suit the new educational principles. The old-time teachers in our country often used individual teaching methods for students, which easily showed results. This can prove my point (and they had a strong sense of responsibility towards students, and there was little distance between teachers and students). On this Teacher's Day, I hope our teachers can be closer to the students to eliminate misunderstandings between teachers and students.</p>
<p>Now, with the national crisis at its peak, the efforts our nation and country expect from teachers are even more urgent. After the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese attributed the credit for their victory to elementary school teachers. Similarly, I also hope that our teachers, when faced with this year's Teacher's Day, will think about the current educational environment and the needs of the environment, and work actively. Although Teacher's Day is fleeting, the meaning of Teacher's Day should always exist.</p>
<p>I hope teachers will broaden their horizons, look at the crisis of the entire country and nation, and not only care about their own small rights. At the same time, I wish teachers great success in their great work.</p>
<h3>A Brief History of Teacher's Day by Shu Yi</h3>
<p>Most of the various festivals used in our country, such as Labor Day, Women's Day, Children's Day, and Mother's Day, are gifts from foreign countries. However, after being adapted to the national conditions by the Chinese people, some have been approved by the government to formulate commemorative measures, and some, although not formally stipulated by the government, have had their meanings widely understood by the society due to long-term advocacy. Only Teacher's Day (June 6th) was created by the Chinese themselves, and it cannot be said to have much history. This is because it was only initiated by some education colleagues in Beijing and Shanghai in the year before last (1931). Although there were grand commemorative meetings in the education circles of various provinces and cities last year, after all, it is not as well-known as other festivals. Therefore, this Teacher's Day is relying on the efforts of our education colleagues. The reporter is here to write out a brief history of the promotion of Teacher's Day, also for this reason.</p>
<p>The promotion of Teacher's Day: In 1931, more than 300 education colleagues from Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan decided that this day would be Teacher's Day to improve the treatment of educators, stabilize their positions, and promote their self-cultivation. The first celebration ceremony was held at the Central University in the capital, and members of the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Education were sent to participate, which was a great event.</p>
<p>The goal of promoting Teacher's Day: The education cause is the administration of the entire country, and teachers are the driving force for promoting the new life of the society and the nation. Promoting Teacher's Day is naturally for the sake of the country and the nation, but in fact, to attach importance to education, we should first attach importance to teachers. Therefore, the goals of the Teacher's Day movement are: first, to improve treatment; second, to guarantee positions; and third, to enhance self-cultivation. Why do Chinese teachers need these three movement goals? Of course, it is for the hard-working and meritorious teachers who are responsible for transforming society and the country to show the country's respect for teachers.</p>
<p>The situation of celebrations in various places over the years: Since June 6, 1931, education circles in various places have held joint celebration ceremonies whenever this day comes. The following is a brief description of the Teacher's Day celebrations in various places over the years:</p>
<p>(1) In 1931, education colleagues from Beijing, Shanghai, and Wuhan initiated the preparation for Teacher's Day. On this day, the first general meeting and celebration ceremony of Teacher's Day was held in the auditorium of Central University in Nanjing.</p>
<p>(2) 1932 was the first anniversary of the establishment of Teacher's Day. Education colleagues in various places carried out celebration ceremonies even more enthusiastically. The Shanghai Shen Bao first published a special edition to widely disseminate the text about Teacher's Day contributed by education colleagues. The places where Teacher's Day celebrations were held included Nanjing, Xuzhou, Zhenjiang, Kaifeng, Shanghai, Hangzhou, Wuzhou, and other places.</p>
<h3>The Meaning of Teacher's Day by Huang Zengxiang</h3>
<p>In May 1931, educators Yu Youren, Cai Yuanpei, and Cheng Qibao, in view of the meager treatment, unstable status, and lack of self-cultivation opportunities of domestic educators, then gathered with colleagues in the education field to initiate the establishment of a Teacher's Day to seek remedies for convenience of calling people together. It was decided that the festival would be held on June 6th every year (hence also known as the Double Six Festival). The first celebration ceremony was held at the Central University in the capital. More than 300 educators from Beijing and Shanghai participated, which was quite a grand occasion. The following is an excerpt of several sections of the declaration of the founders of Teacher's Day, so as to get a glimpse of the meaning of the festival:</p>
<p>"The salaries of elementary school teachers are not enough to support their families. This is known to everyone. Even university and middle school teachers often face financial difficulties due to delayed salary payments. They cannot afford medical treatment when they are sick, and the schools are reluctant to pay them. They are old and cannot cope with the heavy workload, and the schools dismiss them. The cost of living and family burden increase with age, but there is no seniority-based salary increase system in the schools. Unfortunately, if they die in office, their families are left in poverty, and the schools have no consolation regulations... This is why teachers' lives are so unstable and in dire need of improvement."</p>
<p>"As for the status of teachers, judging from the facts, their advancement and retreat are always based on the students' preferences and other special reasons. As for their contribution to education and their integrity, that is not the question. There is no guarantee whatsoever, and due to changes in the political situation, changes in principals, party infighting, and social exclusion, there is often a situation of uncertainty... This is why the status of teachers is so unstable and in dire need of improvement."</p>
<p>"The cultivation of excellent teachers all depends on social support. The usual method is to only examine and eliminate teachers with insufficient self-cultivation, and those who are eliminated are often not given any rescue. As for those with deeper self-cultivation, they are given extremely heavy teaching duties, making them have no time to study. This kind of method is tantamount to cutting off the path of teachers' further study and abandoning their useful talents. Then even those with outstanding academic abilities will be forever buried and unable to develop, and those who are less competent will have no hope of progress... This is why teachers lack professional self-cultivation opportunities and are in dire need of improvement."</p>
<p>"The goals of this festival movement are no more than the following three points: (1) Improve teachers' treatment, (2) Guarantee teachers' status, (3) Enhance teachers' self-cultivation." According to the declaration, Teacher's Day only speaks for teachers. In fact, the so-called teachers refer to all educators, but the word "teacher" is used as a representative for the convenience of calling people together. The movement goals are not only to fight for the rights of teachers, but the aim of benefiting the country and the people is also contained within it. This point was clearly expressed to the audience by the initiators at the first Teacher's Day.</p>
<p>The promotion of Teacher's Day has only been around for two years, and various places have already celebrated with joy, singing, and dancing. The future development can be predicted. It is especially hoped that the Ministry of Education can promulgate a clear order in the near future to designate June 6th as the Teacher's Day memorial day and instruct the national education community to uniformly carry out celebrations, so that it can be compared with the Children's, Women's, and Labor festivals. Finally, I hope that educators in our country will unite with teachers from all countries in the world and designate June 6th as the international Teacher's Day, celebrating the joy of setting up education and seeking the realization of world peace.</p>
<h3>Our Way Out by Chen Jiyun</h3>
<p>In my diary from eight years ago, I wrote, "Our teachers get up early to correct student compositions and check calculation books before the students arrive, and sleep late to prepare for the next day's lessons. Only the time for eating seems to be their own, and even the time for going to the toilet is not allowed to be free. In weather as hot as this, they still cannot take off their coarse cloth gowns or homespun student uniforms. The sweat on their backs flows out, and their hands are covered with chalk, sometimes even their clothes are covered with it, but they forget about themselves and have no time to take care of their clothes and appearance."</p>
<p>"When he sees a stranger, he bows deeply, walks closer, and greets him, asking which student he is looking for. His fluster will make people laugh, but his haggardness will immediately suppress your laughter."</p>
<p>"Suddenly, a student came panting with his chest rising and falling, 'Zhang San hit me!' And five other students said, 'Li Si fell on the playground and he is crying!' So our teacher, with sweat on his back, hurried out again..."</p>
<p>This is from a diary eight years ago, describing our teachers. Looking at it now, it seems like I am describing myself. From this short diary, we can know the lives of our teachers.</p>
<p>Alas, the political situation is not on the right track, and everything is in chaos. Originally, there is no talking about education, let alone preferential treatment for teachers. However, on the one hand, we feel that we have no way to appeal to the public, and on the other hand, we feel that with the country's decline, our work is even more important. We have no choice but to muster up courage and work hard. At the same time, we have to moan and try to alleviate the actual pain. There is no hope in relying on others, so we should retreat and seek solutions for ourselves. Based on the spirit of mutual assistance and self-determination, we may be able to form appropriate combinations, perhaps to alleviate some of the difficulties and find a suitable way out.</p>

<h3>Donghua Football Team's Philippine Expedition 1</h3>
<p>First Match Draws with Spanish Club</p>
<p>Chen Hongguang and Chen Jiaqiu Both Score</p>
<p>Li Yichen Injured, Each Team Scores Two Goals</p>
<p>(Report from our correspondent in the Philippines, Wen Chu, from Manila)</p>
<p>During the Far Eastern Games, our Chinese football team regained its honor for the sick men of East Asia. In the past few years, many football teams such as Lehua, Jinan, and Nanhua have come to the Philippines. At that time, Jinan had the qualification of a championship team, and it was also the opening of the Carnival. The Chinese business, industry, and academic circles promoted it in advance, so there was a sense of tension in the society. Every game was won, and nothing could be broken. Unfortunately, when we were about to leave, an unexpected incident happened. We had a friendly match with St. Peter's School again, and we lost badly by three to zero. Old things were brought up again, and there was still resentment. The arrival of the Nanhua team was even more powerful. Li Huitang and Sun Jinshun were both veteran players in the football world and personally went to the front line. They won every battle, with each game being more than one or two goals apart. It was recorded that in the match with the Philippine national champion team, the score was six to zero. Unfortunately, the January 28th Incident happened, and all the manuscripts were shelved and not used, so the news could not be spread throughout the country. Taking this opportunity, I will add a few sentences to praise the glory of the Nanhua football team in the past.</p>
<p>The motivation for Donghua's visit to the Philippines: In the Far Eastern Games, Philippine athletes were superior in all sports, but football had always been defeated by our country. Their deliberate attempt to improve and deepen their skills in football required observation and consultation. Therefore, the champion team of St. Peter's Athletic Association invited the Donghua team, which dominates the Shanghai A Division Football Open Competition, to Manila to compete with them. Their travel expenses, food and accommodation costs, etc., were provided by them, and the admission tickets were collected by them. Their intention was to seek progress through observation.</p>
<p>Grand Welcome Upon Arrival: The Donghua team arrived in Manila from Hong Kong on the Russian Queen on the 26th. They landed at 11:00 AM. St. Peter's School Athletic Association, Spanish Club Athletic Association, famous people in the Chinese and Philippine sports circles, and reporters from various newspapers all came to the 7th pier to welcome them. The uniforms of the players were white shirts, blue pants, and long flower-striped ties. Among them, Feng Yunyou and Chen Jiaqiu had been here several times, showing off their good skills and reliving their old dreams, which was a rare pleasure in their youth. They are now staying at the Chinese Youth Association, as it is more convenient for food and accommodation.</p>
<p>Competition Schedule Arrangements: The announcement is as follows: May 28th Donghua vs. Kaixuelie Spanish Club</p>
<p>June 1st Donghua vs. Bohemian Athletic Association</p>
<p>June 4th Donghua vs. Peter's University</p>
<p>June 6th Donghua vs. All-Philippine Team</p>
<p>June 8th Same as above</p>
<p>June 11th Same as above (Uncertain)</p>
<p>The reason why the organizing committee formed the All-Philippine team to compete with the Donghua team for three consecutive matches was that the officials explained that the Philippine sports community generally believes that Donghua is one of the best football teams in China, and the players are all first-class players with very strong strength. The All-Philippine players will unite the elite to form an army. In order to have precise contact with each other, it is necessary to give them sufficient practice time so that they can have good results against Donghua. The reason for holding three consecutive matches was that the original best-of-three system was adopted. Because the Far Eastern Games will be opened next year, the Philippines football team wants to carry out active training. It is better to have a practical competition with a strong foreign football opponent for reference to prepare for the next Far Eastern Games.</p>
<p>The Filipinos feared that Donghua would not win. This move by the Filipinos was purely for strict training. The purpose was not in winning or losing, and this move cost nearly 10,000 yuan. 70 to 80% of the admission tickets depended on the Chinese overseas community's participation. Therefore, if the Chinese team did not win every game by a big margin, which could bring glory to the Chinese on the field, who would be willing to spend money and lose face? Therefore, the Philippine organizers were deeply afraid that the Chinese team would not win the first two games.</p>
<p>Overseas Chinese Psychological State Regarding Victory or Defeat: Originally, the football team came south and all knew that they would win, which was enough to fight for a position in the international arena. Therefore, the players of the ever-victorious army were regarded as sacred. The discussions in the streets and alleys were almost all about the results of today's game. Winning a goal in the field, the shouts and cheers were enough to shake the mountains. Since the loss of the Northeast and the invasion of the Great Wall, the international status has fallen and it is difficult to speak. The overseas Chinese psychological state regards a mere football team as a victory for the whole country. It is not enough to be honored by a victory, and there is nothing to add to the humiliation by a defeat. The national affairs have deteriorated to this point, no wonder the overseas Chinese community is so disillusioned with the domestic cause.</p>
<h3>First Match: 2-2 Against Spain</h3>
<p>Both Sides Displayed Majestic Bearing. May 28th marked the date of the first match for the Tung Wah Football Team after arriving in Min. The opponent was the Spanish Club Athletic Association. At 4:10 PM, the Tung Wah team's athletes, amidst enthusiastic applause, strode onto the field first for practice, followed by the Spanish team, who also emerged to cheers. Each team occupied a side, practicing their kicks. The Tung Wah team wore white shirts with blue shorts, paired with yellow and black striped socks, while goalkeeper Luk Chung-yan wore a red jersey. The Spanish team wore blue jerseys, white shorts, and black socks, creating a visually pleasing contrast of blue and white. Referee Zhu La of the Amateur Association gathered the athletes from both teams for a group photo in the center of the field as a memento. Then, the captains of both teams made the choice of which goal to defend. Tung Wah gained the advantage of having the sun behind them and the wind at their backs. At 4:30 PM, Min Mayor En Xiao was invited to perform the ceremonial kick-off. With a whistle from the referee, the mayor kicked the ball, and the battle commenced.</p>
<p>Photograph of the Tung Wah Football Team and the Spanish Athletic Association Football Team Together (Originally Sent from Manila)</p>
<p>The Opponent Initially Took the Offensive. Taking advantage of our team's unfamiliarity with the field's terrain, the opponent immediately launched an offensive, using plentiful passes to penetrate our territory. Tu Kai-yuen was the first to confront the enemy, showing a slight edge by heading the ball to Li Yi-chen. Li then passed it to Chen Yau-tim, who attacked from the right flank. He took a shot from about 15 yards away from the enemy's goal, but due to unfamiliarity with the field, the ball's trajectory was inaccurate, and it did not succeed. Afterwards, the ball was obtained by the Spanish team, who launched a fierce attack. However, Sun Si-king, firmly stationed at our southern gate, repelled all of their attacks. He was praised throughout the field as the "Iron Gate". However, after a series of obstructions, the Spanish army launched multiple attacks on our camp, causing several disturbances. Fortunately, Fung Wan-yau's clearing kicks and Li Ning's miraculous headers repeatedly thwarted the Spanish army's efforts. The Tung Wah's five forwards, due to unfamiliarity with the field, performed below their usual standard, and their passes lacked coordination. Although the two wings made beautiful passes, Li Yi-chen, Chen Hung-kwong, and Chen Ka-kau showed considerable coordination, their shots often missed by a hair's breadth. Fortunately, our team's second line of defense was solid, leaving the Spanish army with no way to advance. The ball simply went back and forth, without any intense action.</p>
<p>The Two Chens Set New Records. After about 15 minutes of fierce fighting between the two teams, Tung Wah used short passes to break through the Spanish army's first line of defense. In the midst of a melee at the second line of defense, Li Yi-chen received a pass from Chen Yau-tim and passed it to Chen Hung-kwong. Chen did not disappoint, sprinting forward on the left flank and taking a low, swift shot. Although the Filipino goalkeeper, Galierse, known as the "Iron Gate," dove to save it, he was unable to reach it. Tung Wah then opened the scoring, triggering thunderous applause from the four stands. After scoring this goal, the Tung Wah team's morale was boosted, and their attack became even more courageous. Therefore, Wan Heung-wah stole the ball from the left flank and took a long shot, with an excellent landing point. The small and spirited Chen Ka-kau, recognizing the unmissable opportunity, aimed for the target before the ball hit the ground and attempted a header. Galierse was caught off guard, and the ball went into the net.</p>
<p>Li Yi-chen Was Injured. After this setback, the enemy instructed their defenders to strengthen their defense, while the forwards desperately attacked. However, Sun Si-king, Tu Kai-yuen, and Leung Shu-tong repelled them. After their center forward broke through our first line of defense, he immediately took a powerful shot from the center. The ball was coming in dangerously, but Luk Chung-yan managed to catch it and kick it out. Li Yi-chen rushed forward, jumping high to meet it with his head, but was knocked out by the Spanish team's left back. The entire stadium applauded his efforts. The whistle for halftime had already blown, with Tung Wah leading 2-0.</p>
<p>The Enemy's Veteran Took the Field. After halftime, the two teams switched sides. The Spanish team made slight adjustments, with their right winger, who had injured his foot in the first half, being replaced by YCHAUSTI, an aging football veteran with a bald head and over forty years old. Although his skills had declined, he played with great bravery, demonstrating the spirit of an old man striving to be strong. As he came onto the field, the entire stadium erupted in loud applause.</p>
<p>A Fierce Counterattack. After the game resumed, the Spanish team took advantage of Tung Wah's laxity and launched a strong counterattack, which proved quite successful. Tung Wah's goal was in danger several times. At this time, Luk Chung-yan became the target of the attack, blocking and intercepting from left and right, demonstrating great agility. He truly proved to be a reliable general defending a besieged city. However, the battle situation shifted from calm to intense. During the bloody battle, Tung Wah's forward, Li Yi-chen, who was still recovering from his waist injury, missed two good opportunities. Therefore, the opponent's forwards gradually improved their performance.</p>
<p>A Strategic Maneuver. As the opponent's momentum increased, their right and left backs often put on a good performance. During one exchange of offense and defense, our Luk Chung-yan also wanted to showcase his skills. When he saw a high shot coming from the left, he mistakenly believed that the ball was close to the goal but the attacker was far away, thinking he could kick the ball out. Unexpectedly, he went too far out of the goal, and the enemy was not slow-footed. They waited for the ball to bounce after landing and rushed to meet it. By the time Luk turned around, it was too late. Thus, our iron fortress was breached.</p>
<p>Besieged on All Sides. After winning this goal, the Spanish team seemed to have received a stimulant, and their performance became even more brilliant. Their left forward once again displayed his long-range shooting skills. Fortunately, Luk Chung-yan caught the ball, but it fell to the ground again. Luk quickly picked it up, but was charged by three of the opponent's forwards. Fortunately, Luk used his basketball skills to defuse the danger, but the situation was still fraught with peril.</p>
<p>A Painful Two Minutes. Two minutes before the end of the game, Luk Chung-yan was once again lured out by the opponent's high ball. He rushed forward to meet it, and the Spanish team's center forward added a flying kick, achieving a miraculous goal. Although Tung Wah tried hard to counterattack, time was not on their side. Until the final whistle, the score was tied at 2-2. The Silver Cup's Fate is Unknown. The Spanish Club had prepared a large silver cup to reward the winner of the day's match. However, as the game ended in a draw, it would remain in the possession of the owner and be competed for again on another day.</p>

<h3>Establishment of the Star-Organized Ribbon Sports Association</h3>
<p>The Men's and Women's Basketball Teams Both Won Last Saturday</p>
<p>Star celebrities Gong Jianong, Zheng Xiaoqiu, Gu Youmin, and others, who have expertise in various sports, recently decided to form the Ribbon Sports Association with the aim of increasing interest and promoting popularization. They have initially established men's and women's basketball teams, mixed volleyball and table tennis teams, and are preparing track and field and football teams. The names of the members are listed below: Gong Jianong (President), Zheng Xiaoqiu (General Secretary and Table Tennis Team Captain), Zhang Yizhong (Manager), Gu Youmin, Wang Jusheng (Basketball Team Captain), Zuo Wenyuan, Jiang Yin (Volleyball Team Captain), Zhang Jianxin, Wang Xiaxin, Wang Xia (Women's Basketball Team Captain), Zhang Xiunian (Table Tennis Team Captain), Feng Yuanchang (Track and Field Team Captain), Yao Benyi (Football Team Captain), Zhang Junyan, Ye Chengde, Zu Zechang, Zhou Jiahong, Chen Lanying, Sun Jiehua, Yao Yun.

<p>Also, the association's men's and women's basketball teams played practice matches against the Star Company's Provincial Team and Production Team last Saturday afternoon at the Star Stadium, with both teams winning. Since they were all from the same company, the matches were very humorous and friendly. It is also reported that the team will arrange matches with the United Photoplay Service and Tianyi Film Company, among others.</p>

<h3>Patriotic Gift Certificates</h3>
<p>— Wu Shuang</p>
<p>Gift-giving is the art of life and the first chapter of a philosophy for dealing with the world. Weddings, birthdays, births—gifts are given. Funerals, anniversaries of deaths, burials—gifts are given. Taking office, moving businesses, taking concubines, openings—gifts are given. The Dragon Boat Festival, the Mid-Autumn Festival, the New Year—these are the statutorily-mandated "gift-giving festivals." Those of us who work in large companies, government organizations, and groups find the burden of gift-giving to be particularly overwhelming, truly exhausting us and causing us to cry out in pain. Moreover, in most cases, without asking whether something is true or false, there is an unavoidable pressure to give gifts. After all, the Chinese are polite, so this matter of gift-giving has become prevalent for a time.</p>
<p>Except for special circumstances, gift certificates are the most ingenious method, because the gift certificates issued by banks can be cashed and also accrue interest, making them completely equal to banknotes and money. The recipients of gifts need not all dress like the second Yang Guifei, and the gift-givers are spared the late-night secret bribery. Gift certificates are thus effective, so they have also become fashionable for a time.</p>
<p>It is said that the Nanjing Frugality and National Salvation Association has specially made plain red gift certificates in denominations of ten yuan, eight yuan, six yuan, four yuan, two yuan, and one yuan, entrusting a certain bank to sell them. All members and general banquet hosts can buy them, with the proceeds going toward national salvation. Thus, they are named "National Salvation Gift Certificates." Originally, our purchases of Aviation Construction Lottery Tickets, Patriotic Lottery Tickets, and Charitable Xiangbin Lottery Tickets, though born out of patriotic fervor, inevitably carry some self-interested desire to get rich. Only the Nanjing Frugality Association's "National Salvation Gift Certificates" are purely for the purpose of national salvation, truly a fine thing. However, while the gift-givers certainly have a patriotic heart, I fear that the gift recipients will be uncivil if they refuse them, but unable to accept them either! How can one bear this!</p>
<p>Upon hearing the news of "National Salvation Gift Certificates," I had a thought that issuing gift certificates for the nation is ultimately not a good thing.</p>
<p>Why is that? If, in the Qing Dynasty, we couldn't defeat England, wouldn't we pull out a "Hong Kong Gift Certificate" to give to them? If we couldn't defeat Japan, wouldn't we pull out a "Taiwan Gift Certificate" to give to them? And there are "Korean Gift Certificates" and "Ryukyu Gift Certificates"—these were taken from our hands without politeness, not gifts we willingly gave. Now, the Republic of China has indeed issued many gift certificates: "Liaoning Province Gift Certificates," "Jilin Province Gift Certificates," "Heilongjiang Province Gift Certificates." These three extremely valuable gift certificates were presented to the Japanese with the words "non-resistance." Tang Yulin even thought the gift was too meager and pulled out another "Rehe Gift Certificate" to give to them. How can we know that our country's gift certificates are limited, while their ambitions are endless? Our eminent gentlemen should quickly prepare more gift certificates!</p>
<h3>Autumn Ghost Talk</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>Single-wheeled carts drive alongside automobiles, and the helmsman of sailboats peers at the sound of airplanes. Therefore, unemployed workers do not seem to be very numerous in China. It only increases the number of robberies!</p>
<p>A writer is preparing to write a novel, using the bankruptcy of the rural economy as background material. But a friend in Jiangxi said, "Don't build a cart behind closed doors! The true reality of the Chinese countryside cannot be standardized by Jiangsu and Zhejiang, just as comparing Chengdu in Sichuan to Shanghai's prosperity." Although it is said that the Chinese populace is no longer as shallow and incompetent as during the May Fourth Movement, the May Fourth's hot blood once reddened the green grass of Zhao Family Mansion. Now, even the white snow outside Shanhaiguan is a mere decoration of a "foreign land's" winter. It would be better to use poppies to symbolize the nation's wisdom than plum blossoms to symbolize the nation's moral integrity. Have you read the German playwright FRIEDRICH VON SCHILLER's "The Robbers"? You'll understand this analogy.</p>
<p>Mr. Hu Hanmin wrote a couplet in the style of the Cao Quan Stele for a friend: "At home, worried about the country, the loyal minister's ambition," "Looking at the water, climbing the mountain, the brave man's heart." In this way, the loyal minister only needs to worry about the country, and worrying about the country requires staying at home. The brave man only needs to climb mountains and look at the water, enjoying himself leisurely. Therefore, Mr. Hu's seclusion in Hong Kong counts as being a loyal minister, and also a brave man!</p>
<p>Demanding to drown oneself in the river will result in being rescued by the police; demanding to go out to kill the enemy will result in being blocked by the general. It can be known that in these times, it is indeed easy to be killed by others. Once one wants to truly die, there are many obstacles. Not even the freedom to die exists; it is truly laughable!</p>
<p>The sky is so high, the water is so deep, but the high sky can fall into the deep water. Therefore, great men also have inevitable periods of political decline and resurgence. Countries about to be destroyed will be destroyed; countries that have been destroyed will be restored. People believe in history. Based on this, China must perish, and then it can be restored! Those who idly dream of restoration are truly slaves of the country!</p>
<h3>Many Fours</h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>"Many female workers." When the work supervisor "Huis" pulled a group of energetic female workers, tall, short, fat, thin, each carrying a tin lunch box, smiling and advancing, every day it was like this, constantly advancing.</p>
<p>"Many chimneys." The arrogant and domineering chimneys reach high into the clouds, and the smoke spewing from their giant mouths covers the sky, fully demonstrating the vitality of Wuxi society.</p>
<p>"Many Ah Fu dolls." The big Ah Fu dolls with plump faces and red cheeks! Clay figurines! In the Huishan North Gate area, they occupy the counters of every store, using their special colors to attract passersby. Those who love them buy them back, and after playing with them for a few days, they get tired of them. I think there are many women in the world like big Ah Fu dolls!</p>
<p>"Many Mao toilets." Mao toilets are particularly developed in Wuxi. Whether inside or outside the city, on the main streets or in the alleys, they are everywhere, catching the eye. Every mile one travels passes by at least three Mao toilets. The stinky industry can be said to have reached the point of development.</p>

<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 8: Indignant Words Stir Young Men; Dismissal of Office and Departure</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Compassion for Young Girl; Escorting Parents Coming</p>
<p>Madam Gan truly did not expect his attitude today to be so strong. Red-faced, she said, "Alright, when your brother comes back, I'll tell him exactly what you said." Having said that, she walked away. Ji Zhi continued to pack his luggage. Sure enough, in less than two hours, Hou Zhi returned. Hou Zhi went to the main house, and Madam Gan greeted him, muttering and grumbling for a while, presumably relaying Ji Zhi's words. As a result, everything in the main house was silent; there was no sound to be heard. Ji Zhi walked to the courtyard and shouted at the window of the main house: "Sister-in-law, I'm leaving. Brother has returned; you can testify that I didn't do anything wrong, right?" Hou Zhi was still silent in the house, but Madam Gan walked out of the house, putting on a very amiable appearance and saying: "Second Brother, you don't need to leave. Let's just drop this matter like this. Tomorrow, you still go to the bureau to handle affairs. As long as you don't quarrel with your brother next time, everything will be fine." Ji Zhi coldly said: "Next time? I myself can't guarantee that." Having said that, he said nothing more. He himself went to the street to hail two rickshaws and moved the bedding and luggage out of the gate like a gust of wind. The male and female servants of the Gan family, without the words of the master, of course did not dare to stop him, letting him leave the gate calmly and leisurely. He himself walked across to the gate opposite, to say goodbye to the Yang family mother and daughter. It happened to be this afternoon. The Yang family mother and daughter had both gone out. He shouted for a while, alarming Zhao Ziqiang in the backyard. He immediately greeted him at the gate and asked: "Oh, it's the neighbor across the street, looking for Old Madam Yang to talk?" Zhao Ziqiang was an attentive person, and Gan Ji Zhi was a careful person. He remembered that once, at the gate, he encountered this Company Commander Zhao, who had glanced at him. Since then, Gui Zhi had lost affection for him. In this, it seemed that Company Commander Zhao had stirred things up. (91)</p>
<h3>After Lake as Miluo</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Nanjing's Yuhuatai is a famous scenic spot, but is also a famous execution ground. Yanzi Rock is the most beautiful place, but it is also the place with the most suicides. (Although someone erected a sign at the head of Yanzi Rock saying "Cannot Die" as a final admonition, those determined to sink into the river still disregard it, and there are still many.) In the countryside, places like this, even if they are famous scenic spots with beautiful scenery, would have long made people suspicious of ghosts and monsters or become areas rarely visited by humans. However, in the city, it doesn't count for much, not being affected or diminished in the slightest.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the morning of the Dragon Boat Festival, although someone imitated Qu Yuan's method of self-exile, temporarily treating After Lake as the Miluo, instantly becoming a new ghost, the tourists in the afternoon not only did not stop because of this, but even more thronged and became a sea of people. Originally, After Lake (Xuanwu Lake) has been full of scholars and women every day since "the cherries are red and the plantains are green." However, as usual, the number of tourists in the morning is always smaller than in the afternoon. The Dragon Boat Festival was no exception. The person who jumped into the water seized an opportunity when no one was watching, and jumped from a pavilion near the Americas, sinking into the center of the lake. Fortunately, someone saw the suicide from afar and quickly rushed to call for help. Less than ten minutes passed, but when they were pulled ashore, they had already completely stopped breathing. This person was not Qu Yuan, who could write essays, but he was not an ordinary person either. According to his suicide note, which was a large set of armed writings, he was probably not an imposter of a "frontline returnee soldier." Some criticized this soldier as "dying at the right time, but in the wrong place." But in the frontlines, there are many soldiers who seek to die wrapped in horsehide and returned to their homeland but cannot. How can everyone die in the right place?</p>
<h3>From Diamond to Marriage</h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>I think the happiness or unhappiness of life and marriage is like the hardness, luster, and strong reflection of diamonds, which are the characteristics of their native ore. The compatibility of temperament, interests, and the outpouring of love is the basic condition for life and marriage.</p>
<p>The value of a diamond varies according to the level of its color transparency and refractive power, its natural luster, and the size or weight of its crystals. It is equal to the composition and results of people's contributions to society, the public good, the size of their achievements and development in their careers, or the size of their eternal true spirit, and the value of their marriage is estimated.</p>
<p>Diamonds are mostly pink and the most expensive, while those that are brown, gray, and yellow are the cheapest. The most excellent thing in life and marriage is a full spirit, a pleasant color, and a harmonious atmosphere. The worst thing is a melancholy face, moaning in sickness, a bickering atmosphere, and living a gray life.</p>
<p>The increase in the price of a diamond is proportional to the square of its increase in size, which is equal to the perfect sex life after people's marriage, the concentration of mutual assistance and understanding, and the proportional increase in love and affection.</p>
<p>Small, opaque, or slightly transparent diamond chips can be used to set drill bits and cut glass, and the very fine chips are used for polishing. This is equal to the lack of ability of both parties or their own ability to use factors of marriage or their lack of qualifications to stand in society. They can only be used to serve others and go against each other, making them a pathetic loser's family in a bankrupt society of collapse. In the compositional score of the country, they add a pair of complaining couples.</p>
<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3>Branches Ripe with Plums</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Sitting idly in my small room these past few days, I heard the calls of plum vendors on the street. Thinking of the shape and taste of plums, I truly feel that my saliva is flowing and about to drip.</p>
<p>Plums must have been used by the ancients as a substitute for vinegar. Therefore, there are these two sentences in the Book of Documents, "If you are making a harmony, you will supervise the plums."</p>
<p>When plums are green, they are sour and crisp and can be made into plum preserves. Besides, there are several other ways to eat them: dissolve white sugar and coat it around the plums, called sugar plums. Soak plums thoroughly in salt water and dip them in licorice powder, called licorice plums. Soak plums in honey, called honey plums.</p>
<p>When plums are yellow and ripe, the sourness is slightly reduced and they can be made into plum sauce. First, mash the yellow plums and add a little salt to remove the bitter taste. Then mix in sugar and cook thoroughly in a pot; some do not cook it but dry it in the sun, but that takes a long time. Adding some rose petals, perilla, and fragrant buds to the plum sauce makes it even better. Women like to eat green plums, and pregnant women especially love them. In the past, there was a poem about pregnant women, with a few lines saying: "All day long, she is sleepy and nauseous, wanting to speak but still ashamed. Smiling, she asks her husband, 'Are the plums on the branches yellow yet?'" How subtle and how vivid.</p>
<p>"The time of yellow plums is rainy for every family." This says that the time of yellow plums is rainy. "The time of yellow plums is sunny every day." That is not right! It says the weather is very good. Is it sunny? Is it rainy? Which one should we take? Fortunately, there is a straddling poet who resolves this dispute, saying: "The time of ripe plums is half cloudy and half sunny."</p>
<p>It takes six years to plant a plum tree before it bears fruit. People seek immediate gains, so they often plant peaches, because it only takes three years to plant a peach tree. However, according to Mr. Xi Guansheng, the owner of Guanshengyuan, "Because of the sales of plum preserves and preserved plums, I really feel that there are not enough plums being produced. I hope that those who plant orchards will plant more plum trees, so they won't have to worry about running out of stock." Indeed, there are many peaches on the market now, and there are many types, so the price has also fallen. But plums do not seem to have any new varieties. I hope people will plant more plum trees, so that the time of flowering will be like a sea of snow; the time of fruiting will be like an overturned vinegar jar, which is truly flavorful!</p>
<h3>Fish</h3>
<p>— Qing Qu</p>
<p>In the early summer, the fish can be considered the most valuable among the fresh seafood of the Yangtze River. However, even though they are of the same type of fish, one must distinguish their origin, just as people only have an empty name, they must not be able to gain social credit. If you want to compare reliability, then you must ask about their origin and resume before you know that they cannot be easily impersonated to deceive people. Eating pomfret really can't be sloppy, that's the reason.</p>
<p>The most famous fish, of course, comes from the Fuchun River in Zhejiang Province. However, there was an old gentleman who fished in the Fuchun River. It was used by later poets to hang and sing, and the lively fish in the river added infinite brilliance, just like people, if famous people are born, they will say "outstanding people and spirits". Jiangshui has the term Diaotai next to it (because Diaotai still counts for something now, it's just an empty name), so it can transfer this honor to the fish. Alas! I don't know what the magic of the previous celebrities was. Why is it so big? In fact, from the principle, it is not what it means. The value of the fish itself is because it is produced between fresh water and salt water, so it is very different from seafood and inland river fresh food. Therefore, if the fish is not a special product of the Fuchun River, then Su Province Speaking of which, doesn’t Jiangyin’s pomfret also enjoy a great reputation?</p>
<p>Most of the pomfret in the Yinyi market comes from Luoxi, and the one produced in Shidong has the purest and most delicious taste, but it is not as good as the one produced in Jiangyin. It can be seen that the place of origin of a person is important. This is also the reason for the fish. The taste is inferior. I heard a friend say the day before yesterday, "Is the price of fish really expensive? Each ounce sells for more than five cents of small ocean. I spent so much money to buy many fine bones to chew. How can I not get stuck in my throat? And I have to swallow even the scales of the fish piece by piece. Isn’t this a weird thing?” Alas! I don't want to cry for the fish, but I want to pity my friend. When Su Dongpo went to Suzhou in the Song Dynasty, he did not recognize the fish and regretted it all his life. Fish is not a common product, and it is not easy to taste its taste. I remember that a poem from the past said, "The fish boat arrives at the riverbank at the end of spring, and the fresh fish is white like silver. The world only has the skill of physiognomy, so it teaches the strange taste in the skin and scales." It can be regarded as an injustice for the fish.</p>

<h3>Literary Figures</h3>
<p>— Qi Fan</p>
<p>I am not a megalomaniac, so I won’t say that a writer's heavenly duty is to become a prime minister and bring peace to the world. In reality, writers are nothing more than decorative items in a prosperous era and execution fodder in times of decline.</p>
<p>Writers are the ultimate opportunists. Their forte lies in praising and eulogizing. Wherever they see glory and wealth, they will display their proud skills. A peaceful and prosperous era is precisely the time for writers to sing praises and enjoy blessings, because a wealthy world can indeed support this group of parasites.</p>
<p>However, this does not work in times of chaos. Their eyes cannot find objects to praise, and a poor society has no surplus grain to feed them. Therefore, their praise turns into curses. Fundamentally, it is still the same. Their cursing of the end times is equivalent to praising the prosperous era, and wanting to be a proud writer of a prosperous era. However, society treats them differently. People in society generally like praise, but do not welcome curses. Therefore, after writers rise up to curse, they will be punished. As a result, executions and beheadings are unavoidable, which is why they are said to be execution fodder in times of decline.</p>
<p>But fortune and misfortune have no gate; they are invited by oneself. The times are either prosperous or declining, and there is no standard. Most of the time, the benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. Therefore, whether a writer wants to be successful or frustrated is up to them. If they recognize this era as the end times and curse it, they can be beheaded. If they recognize this era as a prosperous era and praise it, they can be honored and wealthy.</p>
<p>Because supporting some writers ultimately does not require much wealth, even if society is very poor, it doesn't care about this. As long as writers don't become crows and owls, society will always allocate a portion of wealth to support them. Then, how writers conduct themselves is entirely up to their free will. However, how will writers ultimately choose? We have facts to look at.</p>
<h3>Lili</h3>
<p>— Wei Ning</p>
<p>"Lili, kiss Sister."</p>
<p>A small mouth covered with saliva softly pecked on Ling's cheek.</p>
<p>"Give Sister another kiss, Lili," Ling coaxed him. "I'll hold you."</p>
<p>So another soft peck landed on Ling's cheek, the saliva almost dripping onto Ling's neck. Ling said again, "How dirty! Lili, wipe it off for Sister..."</p>
<p>Lili wiped Ling's cheek with the towel hanging on his collar. He opened his arms and said, "Sister, hold!"</p>
<p>Ling laughed happily, picked him up, lifted him into the air, and then put him down to run around. Ling followed behind.</p>
<p>A small gray and white tabby cat meowed and jumped down from the cabinet. Its white tail stood up, its front paws stretched forward, and it yawned, running around on the ground like Lili.</p>
<p>"Hit, hit..." Lili suddenly saw the small tabby cat, raised his small white fist, and shouted, hopping his feet to chase it.</p>
<p>"Don't hit, the cat is pitiful!" Ling said. But she still let him chase.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Lili's hat tilted from his head over his eyes.</p>
<p>"Uh, uh, Sister, hat, uh!"</p>
<p>"What is it?" Ling asked deliberately.</p>
<p>"Uh, hat..." Lili opened his clenched fist and pointed at the hat covering his eyes with one middle finger.</p>
<p>Ling giggled and put his hat back on straight.</p>
<p>At this time, the small gray and white tabby cat ran under the square table, stood up, and meowed again. Lili was looking around with his small eyes, and when he heard the meow, he hopped over and raised his small white fist again, shouting:</p>
<p>"Hit, hit..."</p>
<p>However, this little tabby cat was very brave. Not only did it not leave, but it meowed very loudly.</p>
<p>Lili stopped at the foot of the square table, but no longer shouted "Hit, hit," just stared blankly with his small eyes.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Hit it!" Ling encouraged.</p>
<p>Lili didn't respond.</p>
<p>"Ha, Lili is afraid!" Ling said, tilting her head. She shook his body and asked, "Aren't you?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Then, the small gray and white tabby cat meowed again. And it meowed even louder. It seemed to be declaring war.</p>
<p>"Uh, uh..." Lili was scared and turned back.</p>
<p>"Lili is not afraid! Lili is not afraid!" Ling said. "Hit, hit..."</p>
<p>She raised her small white fist on Lili's behalf.</p>
<p>"Meow, meow!" The cat meowed fiercely, like fighting another cat in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>"Wah..." Lili finally cried.</p>
<h3>A Textual Research of Xu Beihong Being a Disciple of Liu Haisu</h3>
<p>— He Dian</p>
<p>Careful readers should not have forgotten that someone named Zeng published an article in a certain magazine last year, stating that the artist Xu Beihong was a disciple of Liu Haisu. Xu immediately published a notice in various newspapers in Shanghai to deny it, and Liu also published a reply, each holding their own views, making it confusing for outsiders. Recently, we received this article from Mr. He Huang, with detailed textual research, having sources and basis, so we publish it to resolve doubts. Editor</p>
<p>I say that Beihong being a disciple of Liu Haisu is credible and has evidence. Someone asks: Where is the evidence?</p>
<p>I say: First, the evidence is from the school. Xu Beihong once published a notice, roughly saying that in the early years of the Republic of China, there was a person from Ningbo named Niao, who was on Ai'erjin Road in Shanghai, and later moved to Yokohama Road, establishing a Painting and Art Academy, which was purely a "wild chicken" school. At that time, I was not yet twenty years old. Coming from the countryside, I was indeed ignorant and deceived by advertisements. I was ignorant of the details and left after a few months. I do not recognize anyone as a teacher at this "wild chicken" school. Liu Haisu also published a notice, roughly saying that the Painting and Art Academy was the predecessor of the Shanghai School of Fine Arts. At that time, I was not yet a young man, and I worked hard to manage it. Looking at these two notices, we can know that Liu Haisu worked hard to manage the Painting and Art Academy. Xu Beihong once studied there for a few months. Both sides admitted this, so there is no need to deny the relationship between teacher and student. Moreover, isn't it suspicious that teachers and students are mutually praising each other in their notices?</p>
<p>Second, the evidence is from boasting. Liu Haisu once called himself a master of the Chinese Renaissance. And since Haisu's paintings have been included in the so-called collection of world-famous paintings, isn't the name of the master known to the world? Xu Beihong called it "Great cowhide," which is indeed true. However, Xu Beihong truly obtained Haisu's mantle and essence, so he once wrote an autobiography, boasting that when he was young, his paintings of horses were "even better than the ancient Han Gan"; he also boasted that when he studied in France, the art masters of that country, such as Dagnan-Bouveret, Flameng, and Besnard, "all respected him"; "He is indeed a strong man." He also claimed that "Beihong is the number one in China in collecting works by famous European painters"; he also boasted that "he is steadfast and persistent," and his Chinese paintings "all have profound meanings and great momentum, especially animals, he is unique and unprecedented." Isn't this cowhide great? Not only is it not inferior to Haisu, but it also has the reputation of being superior to the blue. Some people say that in the immature art world of China, there is a "cowhide" school, which Liu Haisu initiated and his disciple Xu Beihong continued. Isn't it true?</p>
<p>Third, the evidence is from flattery. Haisu has indeed painted portraits for famous officials and adults, and he has also widely gifted his own works, the so-called immortal paintings, to famous officials and adults to seek praise. Xu Beihong was deeply influenced by his teacher. "His oil paintings include portraits of Kang Youwei, Chen Sanli, Wu Zhihui, Zhang Puquan, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others," which he wrote into his autobiography to boast, as if he didn't know that flattery was not a very honorable thing. "If the teacher kills, the disciple will surely rob." With Haisu as a master, he deserves Beihong as a top student.</p>
<p>Fourth, the evidence is from betrayal. Haisu once called himself an "art rebel." His disciple Xu Beihong even refused to admit that he was his teacher, which can be called the rebel of rebels. Haisu should stroke his short beard and laugh, saying: My art of boasting and flattery has found a successor. And Beihong can also "not yield to his teacher when rebelling." In the future, when rewriting his autobiography, he may as well boast that he is the only true disciple of the art rebel who has a future.</p>

<h3>Carrot Whiskers</h3>
<p>— JULES KENXRO, translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Sheep (Continued)</p>
<p>While the lambs were greedily sucking milk, the ewes, whose waists were often bumped by the lambs' noses, calmly and nonchalantly ate fodder. Carrot Whiskers noticed some iron filings, tire irons, and a used shovel in the trough.</p>
<p>"Your water trough is really clean!" he said teasingly. "You must be using these iron scraps to give your livestock more blood."</p>
<p>"Not at all," Bardol said. "You'd believe that, would you!"</p>
<p>He wanted Carrot Whiskers to taste the water. To make the water even more beneficial to the body, he threw everything into it.</p>
<p>"Want me to give you a little trinket?" he said.</p>
<p>"Of course, I'd be obliged," Carrot Whiskers said, not knowing what he was going to give him, but thanked him in advance.</p>
<p>Bardol searched in the thick wool of a ewe, pinched with his fingernails a round, plump, and very full yellow parasite. According to Bardol, with just two parasites this big, one could eat a child's head like a plum. He put the thing in Carrot Whiskers' palm and told him that if he wanted to have some fun, he could take it back and put it on his brother's or sister's head or in their hair.</p>
<p>The parasite had already started working. It was attacking the skin. Carrot Whiskers felt something pecking at his finger, as if being hit by small hailstones. This feeling soon spread to his wrist, and then to his elbow. He felt like the parasite was multiplying and going to eat his entire arm.</p>
<p>Ignoring it, Carrot Whiskers pinched it: he crushed it, then wiped his hand clean on the wool of a ewe, without letting Bardol see.</p>
<p>If he asked, he would say it was lost.</p>
<p>After a while, Carrot Whiskers listened intently, and the bleating gradually died down. Suddenly, people only heard the sound of crushed fodder being chewed in the sheep's mouths.</p>
<p>An old wool cloak hung on the crossbar of the trough, as if watching over the flock alone.</p>
<p>Godfather</p>
<p>The Raypique family often allowed Carrot Whiskers to visit his godfather, or even sleep at his place. This was a gloomy and lonely old man who lived by fishing and growing grapes. He didn't like anyone, except he didn't dislike Carrot Whiskers.</p>
<p>"You're here, you beast!" he said.</p>
<p>"Yes, Godfather," Carrot Whiskers said, not kissing him, "Have you prepared the fishing rod for me?"</p>
<p>"One rod is enough for the two of us," the godfather said.</p>
<p>Carrot Whiskers pushed open the door of the warehouse and saw that his fishing rod had already been prepared. His godfather often teased him like this, but Carrot Whiskers, who was familiar with him, was no longer angry. This kind of behavior almost made their friendship even more complete.</p>
<p>When he said "yes," he actually meant "no," and vice versa. As long as they didn't misunderstand each other. "If this makes him happy, it doesn't matter to me," Carrot Whiskers thought in his heart.</p>
<p>So they were always good friends.</p>
<p>The godfather, who usually only cooked once a week, put a large pot of white beans and a large piece of fatty meat on the fire to cook for Carrot Whiskers. Before leaving, he forced Carrot Whiskers to drink a cup of undiluted wine.</p>
<p>Then they went fishing.</p>
<p>The godfather sat by the water and skillfully unfolded the long Florentine fishing line. He used several heavy stones to press down on the two moving fishing rods. He only fished for big fish, and when he caught one, he quickly wrapped it in cloth, as if wrapping a baby in swaddling clothes (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Foreign Banks on the Bund Closed for Business</h3>
<p>The Money Market is Quiet</p>
<p>Foreign Interbank Lending Rates Suddenly Rise</p>
<p>Yesterday, foreign banks closed for business due to the Summer Festival, so there were very few reports of various transactions. Although Chinese banks were open as usual, the volume of transactions was limited. It is estimated that only 1.3 to 1.4 million yuan in bills were cleared, and only about 2 million yuan in various goods, mortgages, and miscellaneous taxes were cleared. The foreign interbank lending rate in the market suddenly rose sharply. Both the morning and afternoon rates were 13 cents, an increase of 5 cents compared to the previous day, exceeding 10 cents. Based on the overall trend, it is expected that the rate will gradually increase in the future. In terms of interbank bill transactions, the morning session saw 4.3 million yuan in transfers and 1.1 million yuan in new transactions. The afternoon session saw 300,000 yuan in transactions, and the Small General Association saw 400,000 yuan in transactions. The clearing of foreign public bonds by money shops was 32.2 million yuan. It is suspected that the clearing of foreign checks was limited because foreign banks were closed for business.

In addition, the total number of bills cleared by the Shanghai Clearing House on the 5th was 3.2 million yuan, 7,981 yuan, and 50 cents.</p>

<p>All Market Prices Reach New Highs</p>
<p>Trading Extremely Active, Afternoon Session Extended to After 7 PM</p>
<p>Yesterday, the atmosphere in the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange market suddenly became very tense around 11 AM. After investigating, it was found that the sudden establishment of a 50 million loan between China and the United States came after the Sino-Japanese ceasefire. Short sellers were greatly disappointed and reluctantly made up for their positions. The market price was like icing on the cake, soaring continuously. The enthusiasm was unparalleled. At the opening of the morning session, buyers from all quarters were buying, with only the 11th and 16th issues being sold in large quantities, but the difference in quantity was like trying to stop boiling water by scooping it out. The increase was a few jiao to 1.4 to 5 yuan. Trading was extremely active. The second session was delayed until 2 PM. By this time, news of the establishment of the Sino-American loan had arrived, and people became even more excited. The current month's disarmament bonds surged 2.3 yuan and were declared suspended. The 20-year Reconstruction bonds and the entire 6-year futures were also suspended due to exceeding 4 yuan. All market prices reached new highs, and the situation was extremely firm. The financial community was buying the most aggressively, and the accounting procedures were particularly cumbersome due to the large volume of transactions. The afternoon session was changed to one session, which did not start until after 7 PM. The bond market continued to surge, with the 20-year Customs bonds surging 2.2 jiao. The disarmament futures and unified salt tax bonds were also suspended due to exceeding 4 yuan. The surge throughout the day was unprecedented and impeccable from beginning to end.

In addition, the New York agent of this firm, Haesdong Company, cabled that the price of American cotton will be determined by Washington's restrictions on cotton fields and economic policies. Before a definite development, it may fluctuate indefinitely. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

As a result, the selling trend in the market was as strong as a bolt from the blue. The market atmosphere was greatly affected and many firms liquidated their positions.

<h3>Bombay Cotton Industry Weekly News</h3>
<p>Last week, the cotton market was more optimistic due to the firm rise in US cotton prices. Later, the bulls turned to selling and profit-taking, and the market turned quiet.

According to weather reports, the monsoon season this year is earlier than usual. The following is a statistical appendix for the past week (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>The Reduction of US Cotton Fields is Still Under Planning</h3>
<p>New York, 2nd, the cotton market report for the week says that Washington's news about reducing cotton fields under the Rural Relief Act is currently under careful planning. This has stimulated buying, which has turned into a reaction. However, its supply is absorbed at a softer price. The good weather and new flowers are enough to arouse selling, but the concept of cotton harvest will be accurately revised. At that time, the authorities will explore methods, including farmers cultivating their planted fields. Cotton inquiries are very active, but the transaction is limited. Most factories stop supplying to wait for the development of industrial management. The passage of the House of Representatives to remove the gold standard is only permitted for the current situation, but it is very important for the authorities to expand the currency program. The Texas newspaper reported that Japanese businessmen were purchasing raw cotton there and shipping it to the front. The weekend statistics are as follows (in thousands of bales):</p>

<h3>Silk, Tea, and Silkworm Cocoon Market Snippets</h3>
<p>(Yangzhong Local Silkworm Cocoon Quality Poor) Yangzhong farmers are unable to raise silkworms; many raise local breeds, the amount raised is again reduced, cocoon production is not abundant, cocoon merchants open weighing scales less often, local cocoons are of poor quality, superior foreign breeds are priced at thirty-five yuan, while local breeds are only twenty-four or five yuan.</p>
<p>(Jiangdu New Cocoon Harvest Not Bountiful) Jiangdu's economy is weak, and the spring silkworm raising quota is greatly reduced. Cocoon production is only about 30-40% of previous years. Limited cocoon merchants rent space, and cocoon prices are not high. Improved cocoon breeds are priced at only thirty yuan, while local breeds are twenty-four or five yuan.</p>
<p>(Xiashi Households Self-Dry and Reel Silk) Xiashi cocoon production is only 30% of normal years. Households have high costs, but few cocoon merchants open weighing scales, and prices are not high. Foreign silkworm cocoons are only thirty-five to forty yuan, local breeds are twenty-seven or eight yuan. Households are losing a lot of money and will dry cocoons themselves to prepare to reel their own local silk.</p>
<p>(Yuhang Cocoon Merchants Stop Weighing Scales One After Another) Yuhang new cocoon harvest is only about 30% of normal. Cocoon merchants have been opening scales for half a month, but the amount collected is insufficient, and the average cocoon price must be thirty-two or three yuan. In recent days, the amount of goods arriving in the market has been limited, and cocoon merchants are stopping weighing scales one after another.</p>
<p>(Nanjing New Style Cocoons Already Shipped to Shanghai) This year, various rural areas in Nanjing raised improved breeds. Although cocoon production is less than in previous years, the quality of the cocoons is excellent. The improved cocoons collected by the Minfeng Company, after drying, weigh less than 300 catties. The new style cocoons have already been shipped to Shanghai and were sent to the factory yesterday for trial reeling.</p>
<p>(Rayon Sales Tend to Be Stronger) Some silk factories in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and other places are now weaving autumn silk in small quantities. Rayon sales are picking up slightly. Yesterday, it was estimated that thirty boxes of Red Blue Golden Bell Flying Horse Double Sparrow and other brands were traded in June and July at prices ranging from 173 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen to 161 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen net.</p>
<p>(Yellow Silk Warp Sales Become More Active) Yesterday was a Western holiday (i.e., Summer Solstice), and banks were closed. British and French foreign firms stopped business in the morning. White silk warp was not traded. Yokohama Japanese silk rose another ten yen, and the current silk price is 700 yen. A New York cable reported a price increase of five cents to US$1.73 (per pound). British, French, and Indian firms did not weaken in yellow silk warp after noon. It is estimated that 134 bales of Sichuan yellow warp, 5 bales of yellow floss warp, and 12 bales of yellow coarse silk were traded, and prices rose more firmly.</p>
<h3>Ping-Shui Green Tea Slightly Moved</h3>
<p>Yesterday in the local foreign firm tea market, English firms such as Jinlong and Xiehe showed slightly stronger interest in Ping-Shui green tea from Shaoxing, Ningbo, and other places. More than 300 boxes were traded in the city, with the top price being 108 yuan, down two or three yuan from before. In the Fine Eyebrow market, there were no large transactions of goods from Tunxi, Shexian, Suian, and other places. Local firm goods have moved slightly more than last week. Only Jinlong and Yihe showed slight interest in red tea from Qimen, Fuliang, and other places, while the rest remained on the sidelines.</p>
<h3>Grain River Rice Prices Slightly Decline</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) More than twenty sources, weak store sales on this street, sluggish market conditions, Su-Tong japonica and Nangang thick rice fell one or two jiao. Tianjin, Weihaiwei, and other merchants purchased more than 1,000 bags of Songjiang thin rice, and Qingjiao merchants purchased 300-400 bags of thin rice. Market conditions remain stable, but high-quality West Liantang thin rice and Chang-Bang japonica, although purchased by other merchants, have not seen significant price changes. Du-Jian is in short supply and flavorful, and the market is brisk. Foreign-tipped and japonica rice is soft and variable, and the price remains flat, with only special goods being more popular.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) About twenty sources from various merchants, white japonica, because it was raining, had few customers on the market, resulting in weak sales and a sluggish market. Thin rice was slightly soft. Early rice was stable. Although the arrival of Yang-Du Bu-Jian was not strong, sales were flat and soft. Customer-tipped rice was average. White yuan had little change.</p>
<h3>High-Quality Ke-Xian Rice Sales Recover</h3>
<p>丨Wenzhou-Taizhou Continue to Purchase丨High-Quality is Secondarily Stabilized丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market conditions for customer-Xian rice, Fuzhou merchants' appetite recovered, purchasing more than 1,500 bags of Hunan rice and 300 bags of Jiangxi and Wuhu rice each. Wenzhou and Taizhou merchants continued to purchase more than 1,000 bags of rice each. Local merchants also inquired about small ground rice. A total of about 3,000 bags of rice were sold throughout the day. The market turned lively, and high-quality rice recovered two or three fen. Medium and secondary grades also turned stable. Prices were similar to those at the end of last week.</p>
<h3>Rare Decline in Flour Futures</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there was a huge change in the flour market. After the opening of both the upper and lower markets, near and far months fell sharply, declining step by step without limit. The decline was particularly sharp in the afternoon. Comparing the high price at the opening in the morning with the low price in the afternoon, November was down 1 jiao 0.75 fen, October was down 7.75 fen, and other months were down 5, 6, or 7 fen. Such a sharp decline was the first major decline since the change to the foreign currency standard. At the opening in the morning, although foreign wheat was down 4 or 5 jiao, the market sentiment was good due to the impact of rain on the new wheat harvest, and there were real customers buying, so the near month rose 2 fen and the far month rose 1 fen. In the afternoon, after rumors that our Minister of Finance, Song Ziwen, had officially succeeded in borrowing a large amount of US wheat from the United States, factories first dumped their holdings. Buyers and sellers continued to sell off. Factories sold a total of 400,000 to 500,000 bags (total sales for the day reached over one million bags). Market sentiment was extremely weak. The decline slowed slightly until closing, but the closing price was still lower than the closing price at the end of last week, with November down 8 fen, October down 6.5 fen, September down 6 fen, August down 5.25 fen, July down 5 fen, and the current month's spot down only 3 fen.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Market Competes to Go Short</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, the wheat market rose across the board by 3-5 fen due to rain, domestic and short covering, and inquiries from factory buyers. After noon, the market was greatly affected by the news that a large amount of foreign wheat had been borrowed. Merchants competed to go short, and the selling price suddenly fell 1 jiao. The closing price was also much lower than the closing price at the end of last week, down 6-7 fen. Spot wheat arrived, and the first batch of new wheat, 286 bags, was shipped from Nanjing and sold at 4.1 yuan. After the market changes in the afternoon, the selling price of new wheat today and tomorrow will likely be lower.</p>
<h3>First Batch of New Rapeseed and Soybeans Arrived in Jiujiang</h3>
<p>The situation in Jiangxi province this year is still acceptable. New rapeseed and soybeans arrived yesterday. There were two batches of rapeseed totaling 76 bags and 40 bags of soybeans. The goods were still presentable. Yesterday, the market was not enthusiastic due to the small quantity and a difference of six or seven jiao between buyers and sellers, so the bags were not opened. Shantou merchants were still inquiring about Minhang's new green soybeans, trading more than 400 bags at prices ranging from 4.4 to 4.3 yuan. Wenzhou merchants sold more than 200 bags of small soybeans at 4.25 yuan, purchased by foreign firms. Because bean prices have risen sharply in recent days, merchants are eager to sell, so the market has slightly eased.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Granulated White Sugar Down Another Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw little change in tender prices. The trend of the guild's clearing price was flat. Changxing Company opened Guanghua Factory's Lu character at 20 yuan 0.7 jiao, old Shou character at 20 yuan 0.1 jiao, new Shou character at 20 yuan 0.3 jiao, Quan character at 19 yuan 9 fen, ground sand plus wide bag at 20 yuan 0.9 jiao, and RA fine flower at 21 yuan 6. The sugar guild opened coarse flower at 20 yuan 0.2 jiao 8 fen and No. 89 red sand at 16 yuan 0.1 jiao 2 fen, each lot being 100 bags. Later, because buyers found that the season for red sand sales had arrived, the market price was higher than the clearing price, so another 200 bags were traded. But then the sellers suddenly withdrew, and No. 24 coarse sand white sugar was still traded at 20 yuan 0.2 jiao 8 fen, 100 bags. There was no change in No. 20 medium sand white sugar at 19 yuan 5 fen, or in No. 89 Dutch red sand. Taikoo granulated white sugar was down another five fen yesterday, with B mark at 21 yuan 7 jiao, CW mark at 21 yuan 5.5 jiao, factory price of Zhen at 21 yuan 4 jiao, and HX mark at 21 yuan 2 jiao. No. 1 dry character ice sugar was 23 yuan, and No. 1 B grade cotton white sugar was 19 yuan 9 jiao, No. 2 was 7 jiao, No. 3 was 5 jiao, No. 4 was 3 jiao, No. 5 was 1 jiao, and No. 6 was 18 yuan 9 jiao. Only the Chaozhou and Guangxi merchants opened Hainan red sugar at 13 yuan 7.2 fen for more than 100 bags, and high cotton red sugar at 15 yuan 6 jiao for dozens of bags.</p>
<h3>Sudden Change in White Tung Oil Market</h3>
<p>Heard of Large Transactions in Hankou Foreign Firms</p>
<p>The upward trend of white tung oil had already stabilized, but news came that transactions in Hankou foreign firms had suddenly boomed, causing the market to change. It was said that the price offered to foreign firms had increased to 25 yuan per picul, showing the eagerness of foreign firms to buy goods. Local firms had no inventory, and were inevitably panicked by this strong sales. It happened that a Hangzhou firm was selling goods in Shanghai yesterday, and local firms purchased about 400-500 piculs of fully weighted tung oil, with the price roughly around 24 yuan Hangzhou delivery outside commission being the market price. It was said that Hankou firms were buying Xiangtung for 20 yuan 0.1 or 2 jiao, and the speed of the market change was unexpected. However, it is said that foreign firms in Hankou have always purchased hundreds or even thousands of tons, which is not surprising, but now the momentum is so strong, the amount must not be small, and although the rumors vary, it is estimated that it may be over 3,000 tons, otherwise there would be no such momentum.</p>
<h3>Good Harvest Expected for New Orchid Bamboos</h3>
<p>According to a letter from Zhangzhou yesterday, the orchid bamboo seedlings are still growing vigorously. If the weather is good, a good harvest is expected this year. The new crop should be available in early next month, but current sales are not strong, and only low prices can meet sales needs.</p>
<h3>Yi Ji White Broadcloth is Scarce and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>White broadcloth sales have been good recently, and Western clothing businesses continue to purchase it. Yi Ji's 112 Dao Xiancao is the most popular, and most woolen cloth stores have sold out. The market is short on inventory, and prices have soared. Previously sold at 4.8 yuan, yesterday all rose to 5.1 or 2 jiao. Retail sales in stores require an additional 1-2 jiao.</p>
<h3>Tin Prices Soar</h3>
<p>After the tin price soared due to cables from Singapore, local prices have also risen sharply. However, the spot market has been snapped up by general users and hoarders, making it feel like it is reaching its peak. The current market is estimated at 165 yuan per picul (small ingot tin), up 15 yuan from before. However, hoarders are still hyping it up, so the price is expected to rise further. Dutch tin is estimated at 180 yuan, also up more than 10 yuan from before, and the spot market is extremely scarce, making the market strong. But currently, spot goods in Hong Kong and Singapore are scarce, so the source is dry, and Shanghai's market will likely rise without falling.</p>

<h3>Lamenting the Death of Hu Liff</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Many people die unclearly, but many people die clearly, and the era of unclear deaths has long passed. Now, the law is strict, and rewards and punishments are strict. So, Hu Liff climbed the execution platform at 1:30 PM on the 3rd, sacrificing himself to the law.</p>
<p>Regarding this man's death, all patriotic comrades, when they recall the One-Two Eight Incident, this man dared to "act as an accomplice for the enemy" and "betray the country," now only to end up with no good end, it is inevitable that all people will be pleased. However, only Mr. Hu himself knew that this death was indeed filled with injustice, so before the execution, he could not help but feel sadness, tears streaming down his face, and then shook his head and sighed, "Selling the land to help the refugees, now to end up with this result, it is truly dark and unjust, what else is there to say? I can only go to the underworld to complain." This suggests that those who have some sympathy for Mr. Hu must doubt that the "Qingtian" (honest) magistrate is not "Qingtian" enough.</p>
<p>Thus, it can be known that things in the world truly cannot always be as one wishes. Even Hu Liff, whose crimes were heinous, would say that he was unjustly accused. Then, for those so-called "Jiangbei traitors" during the One-Two Eight Incident, who were killed in large numbers, wouldn't they all have no place to seek redress? Wouldn't they cause an uproar even in the Yama's palace in the underworld? If that were really the case, the wronged ghosts would only have a day to be exonerated in the underworld. This makes us suspect that only the eighteenth level of hell has an honest magistrate, and the law of the human world is not as fair as that of the underworld, and the court of the human world is far inferior to the Yama's palace.</p>
<p>However, this is ultimately nonsense, not very reliable. Rewards and punishments are clear, like the current law, which is ultimately "the Great Way prevails, the world is for all." Moreover, "punishing those who steal a hook, and making lords of those who steal a country" has long become a golden rule. So, Hu Liff, after all, deserves to die, deserves to die, deserves to die.</p>

<h3>Feeling the Times</h3>
<p>— Jinzhi</p>
<p>Occupying the southwest alone for only a few years, lightning flew outside the window again, and rumors spread. Cherishing a lifelong ambition like that of a noble horse, fearing the wolf beacon fires rising everywhere in old age. Looking at Lu in vain, there is no ax handle to grasp. Where can one find a fishing boat to escape Qin? Burning incense, I wish to emulate Emperor Mingzong's prayer, to descend spirits to protect all rivers early.</p>
<p>丨丨丨丨丨丨</p>
<p>How often have I seen the moon overhead in my life? I should be discussing matters with others while drinking wine. Recalling old times, I spontaneously compose poetry while raising my cup, but everywhere I go, disorder prevails, and my regrets are endless. Some are famous for their ordinary loyalty, like Luo Zhao, while others are known for their literary reputation, like Qin Shaoyou. Looking as far as I can, the rivers and mountains are filled with soldiers and armor. Who can relieve the suffering of the world?</p>
<h3>Patience</h3>
<p>— Qiran</p>
<p>"People with patience are good; people without patience are bad." From ancient times to the present, generally, sages have taught people this way.</p>
<p>So: Rich people can be considered good because they have patience; poor people can be considered bad because they lack patience. Similarly, the richer people are, the stronger their patience; the poorer people are, the weaker their patience. Therefore, the reason why rich people can be rich people and poor people are made to be poor people is this principle. If you don't believe it, there is evidence:</p>
<p>In lower-class cinemas, before it is even time for the show to start, these lower-class audiences whistle, applaud, scream strangely, and shoot paper arrows. These actions are nothing more than expressing their desire for the cinema to start the show quickly. In middle-class cinemas, at or slightly after the time the show should start, some of these middle-class audiences wait quietly, while some also whistle, applaud, and shoot paper arrows, but these are mostly children and people in tattered clothes. In upper-class cinemas, not only do people not make noise before the show is supposed to start, but even if it is past the time the show is supposed to start and it hasn't started yet, these upper-class audiences still sit quietly and wait, never making any gestures like clapping or whistling. This is the difference in patience between rich and poor people. It can also be said to be the difference in patience between "good people" and "bad people."</p>
<p>This evidence seems insufficient, so let me cite a larger example:</p>
<p>The Japanese have invaded our country. People in our country have various different views on this matter: officials, important figures, and celebrities have advocated non-resistance, unlimited resistance, waiting five or six years for Japan to be destroyed by an earthquake, or waiting fifty years for our country to become strong. These views are nothing more than the patience of rich people. They can also be said to be the patience of "good people." However, ordinary people, the general masses of laborers, advocate resisting with all their might, using force to recover lost territory, cutting off relations with Japan, and declaring war. This view, which is contrary to the views of the rich, is the impatience of poor people. It can also be said to be the impatience of "bad people."</p>
<p>As for which of these two views is correct, according to the above reasoning, of course, the views of the rich are correct. But the views of the rich are also different, so which one is correct? This should also be based on the above reasoning, of course, the views of the richest person are correct. This is because their patience is also the strongest.</p>
<h3>The Magic of Women</h3>
<p>— Zhiqin</p>
<p>The magic of women is truly great. Their every move can sway the happiness and pain of men. A beautiful modern woman can attract the pursuit of the opposite sex everywhere, capable of causing many men to commit suicide or engage in fierce competition. Her magic can create world civilization and also disrupt social order. Taking Shanghai as an example, the female attendants in various entertainment venues can attract many tourists like mad bees and butterflies, creating booming business. The female employees in businesses can attract customers and help their bosses make money. In conference venues, the female attendants can arouse the interest and spirit of the participants.</p>
<p>Does the current world seem to be such that nothing can be done without women everywhere? Is there no heart and soul?!</p>
<p>The newspaper of 19 nations extends life, cherish the waste paper.</p>
<p>Oh.</p>
<p>The magic of women can be said to be a kind of heat that creates the culture of the modern world. If women had no magic, the world would not be so civilized, and things that damage customs and morals would not be so prevalent. For example, if there were no modern women strolling on Nanjing Road, I guarantee that it would be as desolate as the Lujiabang Road in the Nanshi area. The major companies selling imported goods would still be in a state of stagnation with few customers.</p>
<p>Stepping into an office without the participation of women is bound to be silent and devoid of sound. The faces of all the men still show a spiritless and decadent air. The room is filled with an inexplicable odor. If there are beautiful vases to adorn the place, and if you enter, there are various inexplicable scents entering your nose, and the men in the room are as well-groomed and well-dressed as new grooms, full of energy and competitive spirit. Great is the magic of women!</p>
<h3>The Lamp of Life</h3>
<p>— Pei</p>
<p>An emotion of weariness shrouded my entire soul. A gray outline clearly revealed a picture of a patient in a sanatorium. Is my pulse slowing down? Is my body temperature decreasing? Ah! This is clearly a precursor to "dying peacefully." How could this misfortune strike my young soul first!</p>
<p>Who says that a sky covered with dark clouds is the eve of a storm? Who says that a mother's labor pains are a sign that a new life is about to be born? Who then says, ah, that the god of boredom has anesthetized this weary soul to this day, this day! I beg to awaken!</p>
<p>I think all day and all night, thinking about the decline of my life: "Rather be broken than rot" - isn't that a microcosm of your recent past, a manifestation of your past active spirit? How long has it been since time swallowed this warrior's spirit? Then the ghost of decay quietly, quietly crept into my, this wandering heart!</p>
<p>In the quiet night, accompanied by a lonely lamp, in the dusk, wandering alone on a deserted path. At this time, the silence of the night lulled the noise of the human world, and the rugged path blocked the stench of the universe. My heart, which had been bound for so long, also gained a moment of relief. In that relief, I realized everything. It was as if a white light was leaping back and forth in the dark and heavy wilderness, from a white-hot color to deep red, to light green, to gray, finally embracing the darkness.</p>
<p>I realized everything. The desert cannot accommodate sweet springs, and the thorny bushes cannot accommodate brilliant roses. In a pile of mediocrity, obstinacy, jealousy, and fickleness... how can the activity of light be accommodated in the wilderness!</p>
<p>Yes, I understand very well. My lamp of life has also been surrounded and attacked by my enemies until it is dying. But I am calm, I am not timid. My offering is only a cold, hostile sneer, not tears of surrender for survival. I have no time to lament my life, for lamenting only helps to increase the arrogance of my enemies. Perhaps the time has come for me to transform from a sneer to hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>I will use this attitude to deal with my enemies! Cold laughter, hand-to-hand combat. I will survive with this attitude.</p>
<p>Labor, longevity, if not dying young on the battlefield of life, is not the life of an ordinary soldier.</p>
<h3>The Abacus of Wishful Thinking</h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>I've lived in Shanghai for over ten years. During these years, aside from the issues of food and clothing, and the detailed accounting of raising a wife and children (matters concerning internal affairs and best kept secret), I won't disclose that for now. Just considering the issue of housing, I deeply sigh at the difficulty of living in Chang'an (a metaphor for Shanghai). Although I've become a minor "second landlord," I not only lack any rights but also suffer from the tenants' troubles and endure the "first landlord's" temper.</p>
<p>In the tenth year of the Republic (1921), I exhausted all my life's energy, running east and west, searching from Nanshi to the Concession, then to Zhabei. After several days of effort, I finally found a two-story building in a deserted area of Nanshi, spending hundreds of dollars on rent, a monthly tip, a ten-dollar "opening fee," writing a security deposit and rent agreement, completing all the procedures before finally establishing a small family. I had hoped to be a free and privileged "second landlord," but ideals and reality are often inversely proportional. Only those who have experienced being a "second landlord" know that my words are true.</p>
<p>Initially, the monthly rent was twenty yuan. Who knew that after I rented it, the rent increased every three years, each time by five yuan, and now it's already forty yuan. When the "first landlord" announces a rent increase, the "second landlord" can't negotiate. This is more strict than any order from the National Government. If you argue with him, he immediately threatens eviction. But to live in peace, I can only compromise. Although everything is becoming increasingly expensive, rent is no exception. However, the location of my humble abode is in a deserted area, with inconvenient transportation, making subletting very difficult. The bright red "Vacancy" sign on the door is always there. Just as a side room is rented out, the attic is vacated again. No one cares about the living room upstairs, and the third floor is even harder to rent out. Moving in and out keeps me busy, and tenants often cause a lot of trouble. The sound of mahjong tiles clattering, loud crying, the sounds of "tablets" and "reading constancy," all kinds of noises, all are incessant. People from Ningbo speak in incomprehensible dialect, and one tenant owes rent while another complains of unemployment. When the "second landlord" is in this situation, isn't he just about to touch the "unlucky star" that goes all the way to India?</p>
<p>The Dragon Boat Festival (according to the lunar calendar) has just passed, and the "first landlord," who makes money hand over fist, has again issued a rent increase order, demanding a thirty percent increase starting next month and requiring a response within three days. If I don't comply, he asks me to get out, speaking sternly and arrogantly. Before it was a five-yuan increase, now he wants to add thirty percent. What an abacus of wishful thinking! How dare he even say it?</p>
<p>Alas, in these times of national crisis, economic depression, difficulty in finding work, and hardship in making a profit, rent should be reduced to ease the burden. But the wealthy and powerful "first landlord" is blinded by greed, oblivious to the difficulties of the times, and unsympathetic to the tenants' hardship. Not only does he not reduce rent, but he wants to increase it. In this situation, one can't help but gasp.</p>

<h3>The Life of Fifth Mistress (25) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Twenty-Three, Bird's Nest Soup</p>
<p>Some time passed, and everything proceeded smoothly. It goes without saying that Fifth Mistress spent happy days with Minister Su and Young Master Zhang. Even though Young Master Zhang still secretly dallied with He Xiang, Fifth Mistress remained unaware, and Wu Gui, her brother, recently bought two more quails, also enjoying his leisure. In short, Fifth Mistress's mansion was filled with lovely peace.</p>
<p>One day, it was lunchtime again. He Xiang came to the room twice to invite Fifth Mistress, but she just lazily lay in bed, unwilling to get up. Eventually, He Xiang came up with the idea to bring lunch into the room and set up a small table in front of the bed. Of course, Young Master Zhang had to sit on the edge of the bed to keep her company. However, Fifth Mistress still disliked the food. She was tired of all the dishes, especially the pork knuckle and clear chicken broth, which made her head ache. Only the bowl of bird's nest soup was relatively palatable. Young Master Zhang understood her taste very well, so he scooped a lot of soup into his own bowl, adding a few grains of rice. He carefully brought it to her mouth with chopsticks, feeding her delicately. Fifth Mistress felt comfortable and softly offered a kiss. But when He Xiang came in to prepare the wash water and saw Young Master Zhang behaving in this way, she couldn't help but feel fiery jealousy and ran out angrily. However, Young Master Zhang was ultimately clever. He immediately grabbed the bowl and chased after He Xiang, feeding her a few mouthfuls in the same way he fed Fifth Mistress. He even added a kiss, but at the same time, he cleverly spoke loudly, intentionally so that Fifth Mistress could hear:</p>
<p>"Go prepare a clean shirt and socks for me right away. I need to wear them out after lunch."</p>
<p>Of course, He Xiang had to answer carefully with her mouth full of rice:</p>
<p>"Understood."</p>
<p>Returning to the room, Young Master Zhang smiled and glanced at Fifth Mistress before bringing the bowl of rice to her lips again.</p>
<p>After lunch, they smoked a few pipes of opium to invigorate their spirits and went out in the car as usual. The car windows were covered with velvet curtains, isolating them from the outside. Fifth Mistress nestled her head against his chest and asked:</p>
<p>"Where are we planning to go?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Didn't you just say you wanted to go to the gambling house to win back your money?"</p>
<p>"No, there's no fun there anymore."</p>
<p>"Then how should we spend the afternoon? Old Mei is coming; shall we listen to his 'Farewell My Concubine'?"</p>
<p>"No, I'm tired of that too. It's always the same old tune, what's new?"</p>
<p>Finally, the driver suggested that it would be interesting to go to the Rouisse auction house to buy some antiques. But she brought back a jade Guanyin. Young Master Zhang felt it necessary to withdraw a few hundred yuan in cash from the Bank of Taiwan for spending money, so the car turned back to the Bund. Arriving, she took his arm and walked up the stone steps with difficulty. Just as they entered the gate, Gu Jingen happened to be walking towards them. Young Master Zhang couldn't help but blush a little, but Fifth Mistress</p>

<p>Movie Special</p>
<h3>Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Joan Crawford's Love Revival</h3>
<p>— Yin Xi</p>
<p>Little Fairbanks vows to restore old love</p>
<p>Crawford also misses him deeply</p>
<p>This is extremely interesting. Perhaps because they are used to performing on the screen, they want to replicate it in their daily lives. But this is not absolutely impossible. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. has now begun working to win back his divorced wife. He said, "I should emulate European men, because European men still woo their wives every day after marriage." He also said, "Anything worth wanting is worth fighting for. I used to fight for Joan, and now I want to fight for her again."</p>
<p>Since Fairbanks Jr. and Joan Crawford announced their separation (separated but not divorced), Douglas declared to reporters, "I must woo my wife again. I will send her flowers, send her candy, send her all kinds of gifts, just like before we got married. I will also call her every day, and if I can't reach her by phone, I will send her telegrams." Now Fairbanks Jr. regrets saying so much; he should have done it step by step. He said, "But these words were a sudden feeling in my heart, spoken without thinking. Our separation came too quickly. I only felt a daze in my mind, and I didn't know what it tasted like in my heart, but I felt that I must find a way to get her back. I want her. I love her. I can't be without her."</p>
<p>Fairbanks Jr. himself admits that he made a mistake. He said that in the two years after the marriage, he only knew how to be a husband and didn't know that he also had to be a sweetheart at the same time. Many American husbands have failed because of this, and I am one of them. I thought marriage was a very natural and convenient thing. Although I sometimes bought her some flowers, I always felt that they were gestures without much awareness. Unconsciously, I stopped paying much attention to my wife. I now hope that Joan can understand my shortcomings and give me another chance to show my sincere love for her."</p>
<p>Now there is a question worth studying: "Is it easier to woo love before you get it? Or is it easier to woo love again after you've lost it?" The usual answer is probably "It's easier to woo love before you get it. Wooing love again after you've lost it is like trying to retrieve spilled water, which is indeed extremely difficult." But Fairbanks Jr. said that although he and Joan are separated, their emotional connection has not been severed. They still love each other, so there is hope of reconciliation. Furthermore, there is another thing that can help Fairbanks: he understands Joan's likes and dislikes at least better than others. "She likes what flowers, what perfume, what candy, what theater she wants to go to, her temper, who knows as clearly as I do? But I do not reject other men's competition. Whoever can take Joan away, go ahead and take her, because I am confident that she will not be taken away by others!"</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Sailor's Luck"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>SAILORS LUCK</p>
<p>Lively plot, excellent director</p>
<p>When I came back from the Nanjing Theatre, I still retained a lively impression of SAILOR. We are really tired of seeing the power of foreign sailors. They sang and danced, went on drunken rampages in rickshaws, charged around in the streets, beat rickshaw pullers, made trouble in taverns, and so on, endlessly.</p>
<p>After seeing "Sailor's Luck," it is a sketch of the lives of American sailors. They swarmed ashore, snatched bananas from vendors, and flirted with women they saw. They made trouble at swimming pools and dance halls. Of course, this is not just a play, but an exposure of their actual lives. However, the screenwriter does not regard this as ugly, but wants to increase the production of the film industry with their romantic and barbaric actions, so they took this theme and constructed a lively plot.</p>
<p>Because of this, the director cleverly made the entire performance very lively. It can be said that there are no dull scenes from beginning to end, especially the opening scenes are even more brilliant. Many humorous interjections are very natural, except for the actions of the drunkard, which are relatively noisy. As for the condition of "sensuality," it has also been achieved. The groups of women in the swimming pool, and the semi-naked covering in the heroine's apartment, are not as cheesy as in other films, and even the last "fight" scene is not annoying. In short, the director's technique is indeed very clever, and Mr. Raoul Walsh is good at this. We have experienced the performances of the male and female protagonists James Dunn and Sally Eilers several times. Eilers is better here than in "Bad Girl," and their joint performance in "Hold Everything" is much worse than this. Definitely, James Dunn is very suitable for acting in lively bean comedies. Several other important supporting roles are still competent, except for the one who plays the owner of the apartment, who cannot please people.</p>
<p>Regarding photography, there is another kind of scene change here. Although the director does not like to use C.U. (close-ups), many of the scenes are very exciting.</p>
<p>However, this film has a major shortcoming, that is, the story is too "coincidental." I don't believe that no matter where it is, this pair of lovers can gather together coincidentally.</p>
<p>As an aside, the newsreel has close-ups (C.U.) of five world giants. Each giant will win a part of the foreign audience's enthusiastic applause, while opponents respond with "boo" sounds. It turns out that people's belief in "great men" is so different after all.</p>
<h3>Review of "Carnival Boat"</h3>
<p>— Wan Shi</p>
<p>When we are tired of watching "martial arts," "love" or "pornographic" films, we often hope to find a film that expresses "power" in the film market. This kind of work can adjust our mood to some extent. And this kind of work, in addition to (THE ROAD TO, LIFE) we have been satisfied in, most of the European and American films will not be outside the scope of "lingering" and "charming" and make us very excited. Then this "Carnival Boat" from Pathe is somewhat unique. There are thick lines drawn on the screen, although this work does not have a real life, but many strong men, rough actions, loud laughter, and the galloping of trains, the roar of cranes, the sound of axes cutting down trees, the sound of sawing wood, all make this work have special achievements in "power".</p>
<p>However, the director did not give up women's thighs and the tenderness of beautiful women, as if without these gentle touches to the audience, it could not become a film. However, these are not as cheesy as those, nor are they the main part of the play, and this kind of interjection does not damage the plot, so the good parts of this film still exist. As for the content of this film, it is not as "martial arts" as the advertisement says, but it describes the conflict between the old and new of father and son, the contradiction between reason and emotion can also be said to be a "moral" work. Because of this, we can see that the author of this film aims to explain that career and love cannot be achieved equally, but they are indispensable, so the young son finally gets the comfort of love under the fatigue of his career.</p>
<p>The photography is very good, and several dark scenes are even more vivid. It can be seen that there is a good configuration of light here, which truly makes the picture achieve perfection. However, the director is a little too ordinary in terms of camera. At the same time, some jokes are also repetitious.</p>
<p>As for the performance, every important role is very appropriate. Especially the one who plays the son is even more brilliant. When he hurriedly jumped over the train, rose or lowered with the crane, placed explosives under the sluice, and the final battle, all showed his healthy physique and strong posture. When the female lead comes out of her lover's house and sheds tears in disappointment, although it is a short shot, it is also very moving.</p>
<p>Therefore, we will not feel disappointed after watching this film, although we will not be satisfied with it.</p>
<h3>Talk about the Three Delicate Birds of the Three Major Companies</h3>
<p>— Yu Jiaqing</p>
<p>Chen Yanyan She is from Beiping. When it comes to artistic performance, she is the best of the three. She has profound expressions, a pure soul, and her chest is filled with enthusiasm, perseverance, ambition, and great aspirations. She is the model of a modern woman. Her fiancé is Wang Shaofen, the photographer of Lianhua First Factory. She is good at playing tragic roles such as female students. Anyone who has seen "Spring in the South," "Three Modern Women," "Struggle" and "New Year's Eve" cannot but praise her and make people satisfied. Her future work is "The Light of Motherhood."</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun She is from Hangzhou. When it comes to age, she is the youngest of the three. She is rich in artistic nature. She is as clear and beautiful as the West Lake. She has a naive performance, a flexible body, and crystal-like eyes. She can sing touching Peking Opera, and she can also speak fluent and cunning Mandarin. No one who has seen "Recreational Gathering" and "Little Actress" does not clap and applaud. Her future works are "Vitality," "Filial Piety" and "Little Sister."</p>
<p>Gu Lanjun She is from Yangzhou, but she does not often say words like "this piece" and "my home." When it comes to appearance, she is the most beautiful of the three. She has charming expressions, a lively body, noble thoughts, and pure aspirations. She is exquisitely lovely. Her future is bright and smooth. Her actions in "The Cry of Women" and "The Future" have already had considerable special success. It is a pity that she is in a supporting role, but in the near future, she will be a bright star in 1933, shining brightly, and will definitely contribute many amazing arts to us.</p>

<h3>THE LIGHT OF WOMEN: MAEDCHEN IN UNIFORM (I)</h3>
<p>— Hsin-fu</p>
<p>Produced by 目耳曼 Film Company</p>
<p>Starring an All-Female Cast</p>
<p>This film is a work that combines the intellectual and economic power of several giants in the German film industry. The staff adopts a cooperative consumption method, with no salaries paid. However, in other words, from the producer down to the supporting actors, everyone is a shareholder. The actors are all women, and the director and screenwriter are also women. The following describes the plot of the film. In the quaint old capital of Germany, there stands a towering, 18th-century palace-style building. Waves of soulful bell sounds resonate, sometimes continuous and sometimes interrupted, carried by the wind. The windows, without curtains, are impossibly dark. The corridors, smeared with whitewash, exude a state of utmost desolation. And the white stone steps in front of the door are so steep they inspire fear. The atmosphere inside is extremely solemn and cold. If it weren't for the faint sounds of singing that occasionally pierce your eardrums, you might mistake it for a barracks or an ancient temple, never imagining that it is a girls' school. A girls' school that holds immense power in the German education system! Unfortunately, Manuela's mother passed away long ago! Her father, being a soldier, is not very understanding or concerned about his daughter's affairs. When Manuela turned fourteen, her aunt sent this lively and innocent girl to such a school with a deep and solemn atmosphere to study. As soon as she stepped through the school gate, she felt disappointed; and when she saw the cold faces of the teachers, she felt even more uneasy. She couldn't help but burst into tears. "What are you crying about? Is a soldier's daughter allowed to cry? Go and change into your uniform!" one of the teachers said to her, sternly.</p>
<p>She! Did she dare to speak? She could only remain silent, tears in her eyes, and leave the room, slowly walking upstairs. At this moment, a maid suddenly called out from behind, "Miss, you can't go that way!" She had no choice but to turn around and follow the path indicated by the maid, but she kept wondering in her heart, "Is even walking subject to interference?" As she pondered these thoughts, she soon arrived at the "dressing room." There, her beautiful hair was immediately tied into a comical and ridiculous braid. Then, she took off her everyday clothes and put on a black and yellow striped uniform. At this moment, she suddenly discovered something on the collar of the uniform. She exclaimed in surprise, "What? There's a chicken heart and the letters FVB sewn on here!" The clerk glanced at it and said with a smile, "Oh! This uniform used to belong to a girl who was infatuated with Frau von Bernburg!"</p>
