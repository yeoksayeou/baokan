<p>時評</p>
<h3>宋子文過日與中國外交方針</h3>
<p>自外長羅文幹巡視新疆之命令發表後。不特日言利用機會盛播中國外交方針改變之謡言。即國内亦羣疑滿腹經當局迭次口頭解辨而不能釋。至最近宋子文將由歐回國更有宋氏擬便道訪問日要人之謡。一時國人目光。轉集於宋之一身。將以其過日時之言動。推定中日外交有無改换方向之徴兆昨日之晨。宋抵日本之橫濱矣。其不登岸。不接見日記者。已足使國人稍明當局之意旨。此後宋氏在日境之兩日間究將如何吾人雖不能推知。然宋氏個人與國家外交方針之關係。則不能不乘此一辨析之。</p>
<p>中國外交之方針。其基礎爲國民黨第一次全國代表大會所通過之對外政策。此非但爲當國當局所應祇導。亦全國人民所竭誠　護者也。羅文幹任外長時所聲明之「與武力侵略者表示最敦睦之友誼。乃萬不可能」實爲依據國家外交根本政策所發之文件。而非羅氏個人之言語。國家外交政策。縱使未能一成不變。然其國也。必須能得國民大多數之同意。方能遂行無阻若以一人之意向而欲變化敵意未銷之兩國間外交關係。則非眜於個人能力。即爲藐視全國公意。近世政治家。未有憑妄如此者。準斯以談國人欲覘知中日外交有無改變方向之徴兆。殊不必遥注目光於遠隔黃海之宋氏一身只須一檢視國内對日情或之如何以斷之耳。</p>
<p>近十年之國際外交史上。非無不得已而與敵對國家屈意周旋之前例。德意志於斯德萊斯曼時代。曾與恊約國訂屈辱條約。蘇俄之李維諾夫。亦嘗周旋於顯有敵意之帝國主義者之集會中。然斯氏能利用賴脫諾所造成之歐洲恐懼德國赤化之形勢。以於中取利。李氏能窥破各帝國主義者不能恊調情形。以分散其聯合進攻之防線。均爲德俄人民所擁護。若中國之對日。則何有者。墉沾恊定成立以後日本之目的。在施展其外交政策以求日滿華親善之進行而已。中國如改變向來方針惟有表示降服。以自　於僞组織之列。此非特全國人民萬難同意。即明智如宋氏及其同儕。亦斷不致誤入歧途况乎唐外次已有聲明。中央外交政策。决不變更此則國人所可釋然者也。</p>

<p>路透二十五日倫敦電泰晤士報今日論英印日在印度舉行之三角式棉業會議、謂近來競爭僡形尖銳化、因此而發生之時局、甚爲複雜、英代表團明日將開始其在商業外交範圍之新奇嘗試、而將有機會以直率討論銷釋日人所懷英國仇日之猜疑、英代表定能表示英國有意甚願將妨害英日間固有友誼之各種障碍銷除凈盡、英代表若能泯滅印度廠商所抱蘭開夏棉業欲防阻印度棉業發展之疑念、則其成功亦不在對日諒解之下、棉業會議所將遭遇之困難、誠未可忽視、但失敗之可能性雖强、引種談判商業恊定之方法究不可不予以證明其功效之機會、有關係之實業苟能成立恊定、則較諸以國際貿易之困難調節爲外交操縱之工具者、彼善於此、英代表團其能以其辦事之固能力與其合作志願之、誠摯感動印日雙方之廠商歟０、前途成功繫於此者、實非淺鮮、苟施以正當之空氣爲好意、則或可覓一途徑、以銷除遠東市塲中之不穏定也云、</p>

<p>榮宗敬談粉價狂跌原因</p>
<h3>美棉支配各廠待宋回商定</h3>
<p>新聲社記者、昨日午後、往訪麵業領袖榮宗敬氏、叩以美棉美麥及連日麵粉狂跌之原因、當蒙详爲見告如下、</p>
<p>（麵粉狂跌原因）據榮氏宣稱、本屆麵粉狂跌、據余所知、實爲二十年來年未有、蓋市價高時、曾達二元六角、而現時最低祇二元一角八分、今日雖稍回高、惟一時尙難望有轉機、據余預料、终須一月之後、粉價庶可轉、究其原因、大致可分兩點㈠華北麵粉市塲、本年已漸被日本麵粉及蘇俄麵粉所奪、致去路大減㈡江浙一帶、近因有鄕鎭商人、利用　水機之引擊、配以粉磨及篩、專收各粉廠之舊袋、在各縣磨粉出售、可免出廠等稅、復因開支不多、佔利頗屬可觀、近且裝置船上、到處代磨出售、致廠粉銷路、大受影響余日前曾因此事、在無錫調查、此種新事業之勃興、幾已遍及蘇省各縣、如宜興·溧陽·丹陽·無錫·等縣、莫不有此事業發現緣是各廠粉之去路亦爲减少、而市價亦不能見好、惟此事頗與國家稅收有關、當局亦不可不加以注意也、</p>
<p>（美麥十月到滬）榮又續談美麵運華問題云、美麥運華、大致總在十月中、美麥之來華、與市塲方面、現未有任何影響、惟本年國内小麥、産量亦甚豐富、將來尙待與宋部長商酌、立能决定如何處置、</p>
<p>（美棉支配問題）至於美棉支配問題、因國内紗廠之衰落關係、究應如何分配銷售、尙屬一極值得考慮之問題、在華商紗廠方面、將來多少總須採用若干、但國内棉花本年出産又多、此兩種多量之棉花額、必有適當之處置、庶能用得其利、故一俟宋部長返國後、各紗廠方面、當與財部先事會商一切也、</p>
<p>日貨突又活躍</p>
<h3>華北布疋長江海産鳴呼國人巳忘國難</h3>
<p>日淸大阪大汽等船、日來開往大連天津者、無不滿載日貨、日紗輸往東北方面、亦突然擁擠、自九一八以來所僅見也、不可不紀、</p>
<p>（布疋載運天津）上海各棧内堆劣貨、邇日紛紛裝赴天津、致日淸大汽大阪昭和等北洋班日輪出口、幾無一船不滿載十成儎脚、尤以疋頭居多、昨日一天、裝去一千四百餘件、各日輪社、更將運率减跌、故報裝者益見擁擠、靑島方面運去日貨、在此一週内、亦络繹不絶、</p>
<p>（棉纱裝赴東北）本月中旬以來本埠日紗廠積滯貨品、以揚子江去路不振、改變運銷方向、爭向東北各地推銷、僞國對日紗運往、更予以種種便利、及特殊待遇、致最近兩星期中、上海日紗運赴僞國者、在存貨三萬四千件中、巳運銷去一萬件、第二次又將續裝萬件、</p>
<p>（海産開運長江）長江各埠、最近一旬來、日淸公司長江上水船、已有日本海産品運去、每次二三百不等、又日本糖亦漸見裝往、每船裝往约一二千包、長江日貨似已在發動中、</p>

<p>（八千工人一致怠工）自老廠三千餘工人、因援助廠方開除葉子間一百四十六號、工人全體怠工後、黨政機關曾屢次調停、奈廠方置之不理、故工方巳於十六日、開代表大會、决定星期五、（昨日）新廠亦加入怠工、以資援助、昨晨七時、新廠因即遵照决議、一致怠工、惟照常進廠、而不做工作、現怠工人數、已約八千餘人、昨日新老兩廠除水電外、各部均告停工、（該廠水電均係自備）</p>
<p>（致函各界請求援助）五區捲烟工會、以兩廠總怠工後、諒一時未能解决、故昨日已備就公函、請求各界援助、一面定十八日下午四時、召開緊急代表大會、討論應付方針、是否擴大實行罷工等問題、二十九日下午二時、將在靑年會九樓、招待報界、報告工潮眞相、三十日下午二時、招待各公團、請求予以文字或經濟上之援助云、</p>

<p>反戰會馬萊等昨回滬</p>
<h3>據謂日將有代表派來馬氏並擬赴北平一行</h3>
<p>世界反戰會席馬萊勛爵、前偕比代表赴日、現已乘德輪恩尼亞斯回滬、於昨日下午三時半抵埠、馬氏等至下午五時許、始由江漢關碼頭上岩、據語新聲社記者謂、抵日後曾與日文化團體接洽、請彼等派代表來滬、現渠得到官方消息、日本將有代表派來、但有幾人派來、及所派何人、均尚不得而知、馬氏末言在日被拒登岸事、至美國對該會之態度、謂渠尙無機會與美接洽、故美方態度如何、不得而知、馬氏又謂渠希望不久赴北平一行、至上海開會開會之日期及地點、將俟彼等開會討論後再發表、</p>
<p>大美晚報云、本埠方面曾盛德英國前工黨議員韋金生女士亦欲來滬、參加反戰會議、今日（二十五）英代表哈密爾敦否認此說、谓韋金生女士實未嘗有來滬意、此說由來、大約因韋女士曾偕馬萊勛爵往瑪德里、英報遂揣想兩人將同往中國、其實馬萊勛爵在瑪德里與韋女士作别後、獨赴馬賽、與諸代表表合而來上海、至巴比塞則因身體不健、未能來滬、渠曾於三月間至里維拉之米拉瑪爾地方訪問巴比塞、見其體弱多病、對於出席會議、已不成問題、又關於片山之種種誤會消息、因馬萊勛爵將於今日乘愛尼亞斯輪船回滬、當由馬氏發一聲明、渠未便作答、惟片山行蹤、渠信月下並不在日、仍居區洲、至中國保境會所稱將在八仙橋中國靑年會舉行預備會議一節、就渠所知、絶非事實、又關於向公共租界當局聲請准在界内舉行會議一事、亦須待馬萊勛爵回滬後辦理、目下尚未聲請、馬萊勛爵將於今日下午抵埠、在滬各代表已準備乘渡輪往迓、工部局並將派特别巡捕照料、以防過度熱心之學生有游行示威舉動云、</p>

<h3>財實兩部籌徴外貨傾銷稅</h3>
<p>確定徴收標準十種</p>
<p>宋返國後定期實行</p>
<p>日煤進口業已加徴每噸一兩</p>
<p>華東社云實業財政兩部、以年來外貨傾銷市塲、致國貨營業、一蹶不振、阻碍我國實業前途、實匪淺鮮、爰援民國二十年九月國民政府公佈之傾銷貨物稅法章程、籌備開徴傾銷稅、自進行以來、審查貨物方面、業經完畢、並經確定徴收者計有十種、一俟財宋返國、加以討後、即可定期實行、並聞日煤進口、現巳先行每噸加徴銀一兩、茲誌各情如下、</p>
<p>（審查完畢）財實兩部、因欲審定每種貨物是否有傾銷性之標準起見、曾合組「傾銷貨物審查委員會」、設立於南京財政部内、滬地則設辦事處於江海關内、由財實兩部有關係司署長、負責調查外貨在華傾銷情形、訂立徴稅貨物類、並轉咨外交部令飭駐外各領事、就近調查各貨價目、以定是否屬實傾銷、該項調查手續、茲已完全竣事、僅待財宋返國、視加審定、即可公佈施行、</p>
<p>（確定種數）此項傾銷稅徴收標準、並不普及各貨、祇限於與我國産貨手相抵觸、而妨碍國貨銷路之外貨、現巳經確定徴收者、爲棉紗綢茶葉布疋米麥木材魚類燈泡火柴等十種、至其他必需之外貨則仍照常收取進口稅、不徴收傾銷稅、</p>
<p>（日煤開徴）華東社記者、昨訪傾銷會滬辦事處某委員、據稱、徴收外貨傾銷稅、原爲竌兩受裨益爲主旨、徵收之種類、以我國生産自能供給市塲者爲標準、俾國産貨物、因外貨贬價排斥而發展、惟因國貨缺乏、外徵收傾銷稅後、而高價出售市塲、民衆反受其害、因此不得不愼重考慮、按貨逐步實施、擬將外貨棉紗及麫粉等進口之貨物、先行徵收、十月一日起或可實行、其次關於外煤進口傾銷稅問題、異常重大、現日本之撫順煤、英國之開灤煤、同在華傾銷、徵收傾銷稅手續、異常複雜、現爲顧全各方種種起見、必須愼重商討、茲爲通融計、已將日煤進口每噸加徵銀一兩、作爲臨時徵收性質云、</p>

<p>扶輪杯中葡决賽第一日鄭兆佳直落三勝遜那</p>
<h3>王文正未能勝柯拉沙</h3>
<p>丨比數三比六·四比六·六比零·六比六未終丨</p>
<p>今日下午三時半單打續賽繼以雙打</p>
<p>中華公開網球單打錦標王文正、雖曾戰勝鄭兆佳、但昨在扶輪杯萬國綱球决賽中、竟未能擊敗葡萄牙之日柯拉沙、王雖發揮其固有技能、但均爲柯拉沙擊破、以致王幾陷於智窮力盡、而連失第一及第二兩盤、比數爲三比六、四比六、第三盤王以六比零全勝、第　盤柯拉沙先勝二局、王連勝五局、以爲勝利有望、但又被柯拉沙追上至五比五、王又勝一失一、乃成六比六、時在六時十分、滿天鳥雲、視線不淸、且大雨將至、乃停賽、今日下午繼續交鋒、</p>
<p>鄭兆佳原對葡萄牙馬賽　、但臨時由去年草地網球會初級單打亞軍遜那出塲、鄭以六比四、六比四、六比一勝、是塲表演少精彩、形勢欠緊張、鄭之擊法、巳有　步、但　球時下拍仍極遲緩、予對方得暇措置部位、　足以减少比賽之緊張、</p>
<p>中華網球塲觀衆約四五百人、對於柯拉沙之　戰王文正、發生濃厚興趣、但有少數不良份子、輒怪亂呌、或作無謂之拍掌、且往往亂呌球「出界」或好球、擾亂秩序、殊非網球塲上應有之現象、</p>
<p>巡邊員均係看台上臨時拉請者、往往不能克盡其職、失　之處、在所不免、且於球之出界、每無淸晰之表示、此皆由於缺少訓練所致裁判員似亦少敏銳之眼光、</p>

<h3>柯拉沙力窘王文正</h3>
<p>（兩盤連失）王文正兩次發球局均失、柯拉沙則連取兩發球局、瞬息之間、柯卽以四局全勝、王又發球、先以三記佔先（四十比零）、但被柯拉沙連勝四記、又陷王於危　、然王終能擊回是局、並取以下柯拉沙之發球局、而成二比四、第六局上、柯雖失利、有良好表演、每以深遠之球、攻王之反手、乘機上網時奏奇功、博得觀衆掌聲不少、人後三局、各以發球局獲勝、柯拉沙得以六比三取首盤、第二盤之第　局、柯發球先負十五比四十（一丨三）、反奪是局、又取王之發球局成二比零、王加上兩局成平手、以下三局柯又連勝成五比二、勝利希望又極高、其中之第六局、王發球以滑四失敗、、王取第八局後、柯發球先勝四十比零（三丨零）、而被王扳轉、但第十局仍歸柯拉沙、乃成六比四、柯再勝、</p>
<p>（挽回已遲）王連失兩盤後、觀者均爲驚嘆、二人竸爭之劇烈、不可多見、局勢旣甚緊張、精彩因之愈增、王表演之技能、有進無减、但對手善於奔走、還球迅速且精各種擊法、堅忍耐戰、王無法破之、第三盤開始、柯忽失去銳芒、球多失誤、先後判若二人、被王全勝六局、甚爲容易、第四盤柯拉沙又恢復原狀、連取兩局、第三局王曾佔優先、柯得一觸網帶球、過網落地成平手、因而勝是局、王處於此種危局下、力圖振作、二人劇戰愈烈、各不放鬆、興趣愈覺濃厚、五竟連勝五局、造成優越形勢、當第六局上、二人高挑攔　、東奔西跑、時陷於危急、均能挽救回過、博得熱烈掌聲、此時王如再勝一局、卽可勝盤、詎知事竟不然、竟被柯拉沙亦連得三局之多、因之成爲五五平手、第十局上王發球失去且爲滑四、大爲失望、但柯拉沙之發球局、亦被王報以滑四、王遂再佔優先、惜第十二局又爲柯勝、又成六比六、時狂風大作、天色如晚、充滿雨意、比賽實不克繼續而停止、</p>
<h3>鄭兆佳直落三勝</h3>
<p>（去年亞軍）葡萄牙選手原定馬賽爾臨時起用遜那、查遜那爲去年草地網球會初級單打亞軍、决賽敗於孫　方者、今年球藝、頗有進步、鄭兆佳雖以直落三勝、前二盤比數頗接近、鄭之兩邊對角擊法、巳有相當把握、但其下拍甚遲、予對方得從容措置部位、且因之影響比賽不能緊張、蓋下拍迅速非特足以緊張形勢、增加竸爭興趣、且使對手不及踏定部位、而易於取勝、此爲戰略上最重要者、甚　鄭注意之、</p>
<p>（連勝三盤）開首遜那頗佔優勢、先以三比一及四比二勝、鄭徐徐追上、由四比四平手後、以六比四勝二盤、第二盤鄭先取三局、往後兩次輪流得勝一局、成五比二遜那又連增二局、鄭卒再以六比四結束第三盤上、遜那銳芒已退、除勝首局外、一失再失、連負六局、鄭乃以六比一成直落三之戰績、</p>
<h3>今日秩序甚吃重</h3>
<p>昨日王文正對柯拉沙旣未結束、乃定今日繼續在中華網球塲交鋒、此二人固均不參加雙打比賽也、是戰勝負、殊難預卜、柯拉沙之一鼓作氣、殊爲猛銳、王如不能壓制其鋒芒、卽使邓得第四盤、形勢仍極危險、是賽定三時半開始、四時起則爲雙打比賽是戰勝負、亦難預卜、秩序如下、</p>
<p>單打　王文正對Ｈ柯拉沙　三時半</p>

<h3>簡便經濟的電源部份檢視器</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>交流收音機，一有困難，非有精細的儀器電表測騐方可，此種儀器，價値極貴，使用不易，偶不謹愼，可毁之於頃刻，本篇所述之檢視器，經濟簡便，用以測騐普通收音機的電源部份，已足有餘。</p>
<p>製法普通收音機的整流管，多爲280，其燈座係ＵＸ四脚式，所以本器所需的材料，僅ＵＸ四脚燈座一只，已壞ＵＸ式眞空管上拆下的膠管一只，六伏脫小燈泡一只，小號電瓶軋頭兩只。</p>
<p>各件的連接如圖所示：燈座上燈絲Ｆ兩端直接連至膠管下兩脚，Ｐ與Ｐ亦直接相連，Ｇ與Ｇ間串聯一小燈泡，兩軋頭可並接於燈泡兩端。</p>
<p>檢騐法檢騐時，先將收音機内整流管拔下，插在檢視器的燈座内，然後將檢視器插入收音機整流管座，留意觀察小燈泡之光度，如收音機工作合法，則小燈泡僅能有極微之光亮（電力過大的收音機例外），如小燈泡超過一半光度時，表示整流管的負荷（Ｌｏａｄ）過大，應留意檢視各處有否短路，例如濾波電容器　各傍路電容器有完全短路時，電流過大，小燈泡可立即燒斷，不致損及電源變壓器及其他各件，所以此器兼可作保險絲之用。此時應進一步檢視何處成短路，可將收音機内機件卸出，擴聲器仍連住，檢視器的小燈泡除去，換一隻二百廿弗打五十瓦特的燈泡，接在小電瓶軋頭上，將收音機開啓，開啓的時間不可太久、否則變壓器整流管等機件或將損壞，留意燈泡的光度，一面迅速將可疑機件之線路拆斷，再觀察燈泡的光度，如無變更，則該機件完好無病，如此一一試之，直至損壞的機件找出爲止。</p>
<p>如小燈泡所示光度，在整流管所能負荷範圍以内，此時可將小燈泡除去，以一０丨１５０ＭＡ電流表接在軋頭上（如無電表亦可留意小燈泡光度之明暗代之），開啓收音機，記住電表的指數，然後將收音機内各眞空管，逐一除去，再將每一眞空管除　去所减少的電流記出，以比較此數，是否爲該管應費之屏極及簾柵電流，如某管除去後，電表指數，並未减少，則須留意檢視該管各路有否中斷。</p>
<p>如小燈泡或電有，絶無所示，則可檢視電源部份之濾波扼制圈等有有無中斷、</p>
<h3>地線雜聲的避免</h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>收音機的靈敏度越高，放大级數越多，他的雜聲也愈大而愈多。天綫回路是很靈敏的，祇要有一些些的電壓變化，都可以影響到喇叭裏，放出極大的雜聲來。收聽本埠時雜聲的影響到還小，假如收聽外埠的話，那末我們不可不盡力在可能的範圍内把雜聲减少至極低度。不過天電的影響我們們還不能將他消滅，但是在天地綫方面所發生的雜聲，我們是有消滅的可能的。平常我們的地綫是用一根鐵條插入土中，但是往往因爲鐵條和泥土生出一種電化作用來，鐵條變成了一個電極。其間的電位差有時竟超過一千米厘弗打，於是收音機裏發出討厭的雜聲來了。避免的方法，可以做一個不會極化的電極來代替鐵條：方法很簡單便捷。如圖，Ａ是素燒筒或稱泥漏筒，是一種未上袖的瓷簡（平常濕電池裏用的，理化儀器店有售）Ｂ是硫酸銅，Ｃ是他的純溶液，Ｄ是铜條　收音機地綫柱，Ｅ是地面。Ｄ浸人溶液中以不接　他物宜。</p>
<p>各物如圖裝配好後，说將素燒筒放在地上或插入土中一二寸左右。因爲硫酸銅的溶液慢慢的從筒裏滲透出來與泥土接觸，電便可以通過了。他的功用和鐵條插入地面一樣，但是因爲不生電化現象，所以也没有電位差的發生，那末收音機裏也没有雜聲出來了。</p>
<h3>眞空管集錦</h3>
<p>— 銘</p>
<p>電子電子的重量是1／4６×ＩＯ３６的盎司，牠　的速度每秒有幾千哩。假使温度　加特們行動更速。</p>
<p>製造絲極的質料絲極或者是直熱式的陰極的質料常用的有三種：一種是純　絲，用於高温度（明亮的白色）；一種是釷　絲（Ｔｈｏｒｉａｔｅｄ　ｔｕｎｇｓｔｅｎ）用於平常的温度（黃色，光明）；一種是　土金屬（Ａｌｈａｌｉｎｅ　ｃａｒｔｈｓ）外面常塗有　的混合物，祇要很低的温度（暗紅色）就可作用。因温度的需要有高低，所以外面所加的絲極電壓也就不同了。</p>
<p>交流直流管電池式的眞空管用交流電不能滿意，因爲交流電每一改變，電子的發稱和空間電荷（Ｓｐａｃｅ　ｃｈａｒｇｅ）中的電位也都要改變的。這種改變經管放大後就在喇叭中發出交流的營營聲。所以燈絲陰極式的管要用交流電供給，須另行設計製造，２６號管就是一個例子。</p>
<p>整流管中的水銀假使管中没有空間電荷的存在，用較低的屏壓也能得到和用較高屏壓所得相等的電子。消除空間電荷的一個方法，常利用於幾種整流管，例如８２號水銀蒸氣整流管，這管貯有小量的水銀，在使用時水銀一部被蒸發。管内就充滿了水銀蒸氣所包含的水銀原子。這些原子當電子飛向屏極時就被衝擊着。如電子的行動到相當高速，就把水銀原子中的電子刦去。這樣，水銀原子可說是「電離」（ＩＯＮＩＺＥＤ）了，就是這原子已失去了一個或幾個電子，因此就有了正電荷。當水銀原子因絲極發出電子的衝擊而起電子分離後，空間電荷　（是留在絲極和屏極間的電子，有了要排斥後來的電子的）就給水銀正離子（</p>
<p>ION)中和這樣，就增加了電子的總數。水銀蒸氣整流管陰極和屏極間的電壓降不大（约十五弗打）。這降落實際上並不和絲極電子發射的限止及需用電流有關而是有一些要看管的温度的。</p>
<p>極間電容（Ｉｎｔｅｒｅｌｅｃｔｒｏｄｏ　ｃａｐａｃｉｔｉｅｓ）眞空管的電極形成了靜電體系（Ｅｌｅｏｔｒｏｓｔａｌｉｅ　ｓｙｓｔｅｍ），每一電極都好比小電容器的一片。在三極管中，這種電容稱爲「極間電容」，是存在柵和屏間，屏和陰極間，同柵和陰極間，其中柵和屏間的電容量要算最重要。在高增益量（Ｇａｉｎ即電壓放大Ｖｏｌｔａｇｏ　ａｍｐｌｉｃａｔｉｏｎ）射</p>
<p>電週率放大路内，這個電容量可使輸入和輸出路間産生無謂的偶合，因此就起了不能制止的再生。（未完）</p>
<h3>短波發射機之調準法及其步驟（續）</h3>
<p>— 羅靜予</p>
<p>（甲）哈特來：哈特來這一種線路，是屬於感應交連類的；因爲他易於産生振　，所以十分流行；不過發報機電能增加或减少的變換，頗不容易，所以一般的效率不能稱爲很高。其線路如第一圖：</p>
<p>圖中Ｅ點是可以上下變動的，其結果，便是變換屏極圈數和柵極圈數多少的比例。因爲實際上ＥＰ兩點間之線圈即屏極圏，ＦＧ兩點間之線圈即柵極圈。故柵極圈數，若是多過於屏極圈數，其激勵（Ｅ　ｃｉｏａｔｉｏｎ）必大，屏流也就必增。所以我們調節哈特來的線路時，除將電容器Ｃ位於我們預定的波長之度數後，即以Ｆ點之移動，來尋覓振盪情形之最佳的標準點。丨大致從經騐上得來的結果，屏極圈數與柵極圈數之比例，是四與一或五與一之比，就恰到好處。又圖中Ｃ最初雖是位於正確的度數處，但柵極圈數的變換，對於波長却有相當的影響。所以覓得振盪情形之最佳點後，必須以波長表重新较騐，而以Ｃ以之度數變動，使之符合原定的波長。（柵極圈圈數在調節時加多，较調準前之波長長，减少則較調準前之波長短。）</p>
<p>（乙）考畢茲；考畢茲這一種線路是屬於電容量交連的，結構雖與哈特來同出一轍，但是缐圈却換做了電容器，所以平常用電容量不大的天線，也可以得着很好的效果。同時他調節的地方也不是如哈特來是靠Ｆ點在線圈上的移動，是以電容器的變動來覓取振盪情形最佳的標準。</p>
<p>圖二便是考畢茲的線路，Ｃ２是用以確定波長的，Ｃ３便是用作調節振盪的。因爲Ｃ３的本身，在這兒有電壓降來作柵極的激勵，所以Ｃ２電容量的變動，即是屏柵間交連之比例的變動。當我們進行調節時，則置Ｃ２於半數（即刻度盤上之五十度處），然後將Ｃ３由最大量（即刻度盤上之一百度處）漸漸旋轉，及至屏流達到最小的一點，其所示之度數，便是我們欲獲的振盪情形最佳之標準點。根據這　情形，同時我們更可以知道電容量愈大，則抵抗愈小，而電壓降亦隨此變小，故其對柵極的激勵，也跟着變小了。（未完）</p>
<h3>隻手定律</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>人身如果遇到一百弗打以上的電壓，便有危險。現在的交流收音機，屏更易發生不測。試騐時最好能時常牢記隻手定律，（Ｏｎｅｈａｎｄ　ｒｕｌｅ）便能避免危險。</p>
<p>譬如你在整理代乙電的時候，一手握住高壓Ｂ十，一手却誤觸Ｂ一或是地線，這樣，電流通過你的心臓，便要發生意外，因此，在高壓線路内工作，最好不要雙手並用，在萬不得已的時候，也須帶上一只皮手套　是。</p>
<p>同樣，如果你站在泥地或是潮濕的地板上工作，最好穿雙橡皮底芏，或是在地上舖一方乾燥的木板，便很安全。</p>
<h3>關於聽筒的常識</h3>
<p>— ＲＦ</p>
<p>聽筒爲一種構造精細的器具，不可受强烈震動，或置於潮濕之處，否則易於損壞。</p>
<p>聽筒之二脚；其一脚爲紅色或花色，另一爲藍色或素色。除礦石機上可以隨意接用外；在眞空管收音機上，紅色或花色之脚應接乙電正極，藍色或表色之脚應接末級眞空管之屏極。否則日久，其中永久磁石性漸失，聽筒發聲漸低，終至失却聲音效力。</p>
<p>如有數只聽筒接至同一收音機使用時；則應以第一只之素脚接於第二只之花脚，第二只之素脚接至第三只之花脚，餘類推，然後將第一只之花脚接至收音機乙電正極，末只之素脚接至輸出管之屏極。</p>
<p>如不能斷定聽筒之何脚應接乙正，可將此聽筒任意接至收音機上，其發聲較高時接至乙正之脚應接乙正。或將聽筒雙脚交換接至约二十弗打之小電池上，則其發出較響之爆裂聲時，接至此電池正極之脚，應接乙電正極。</p>
<p>聽筒多聽後，其薄膜上每有水滴，此乃人體所蒸發之水份所凝聚而成。最好聽後以吸水紙輕輕吸去之，切勿以粗布用力磨擦，以免擦去薄膜上之防銹溙，致薄膜銹爛而發音粗劣。</p>
<h3>簡易的“Ａ”電瓶</h3>
<p>— 張國泉</p>
<p>這個“Ａ”電瓶是靠一個已用盡的圓乾電池來做成的，輸出的電壓同圓乾電池相等，不過電流較弱，但也頗適用於燃點眞空管燈絲，</p>
<p>第一步手續：取一個舊的圓乾電池除去外包的　片將電池中間的一根炭條取出，再做一隻比炭條大些的布袋把炭條放進，再把電池内粉末塞入袋中裝滿，用　紥緊袋口，但須把炭條有接線螺絲一端少許露出以備接綫。</p>
<p>第二步手續：到藥房買些阿姆尼亞和入淸水中（阿姆尼亞三份水約十份）注入大口的玻璃瓶中，（如牛奶瓶）備用，　　第三步手續：剪一塊圓電池外包的　片闊度照於進瓶口爲準，長度較炭條短些，再把　片鑽一洞接住銅絲一根。　　第四步手續：把炭條袋置入瓶中再把　片放入附在袋旁，用時炭條爲正極　片爲負極·如此這電瓶就可告成功了。</p>
<p>小經騐</p>
<h3>萬向烙鐵</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>平常的烙鐵，大概與執柄是成直角的。此種烙鐵，在構造簡單地位寛敞的地方使用，固然不覺困難，但是如果在構造複雜地位狹窄的地方使用，便時常會感覺到不能運轉自如。</p>
<p>烙鐵一方，長三英寸，闊四分之三英寸，厚四分之一英寸，（過大不易傳熱，過小不易保持熱度。）用螺釘及螺帽緊抱在鐵柱上，使用時可將烙鐵轉成各種方向，以適合各處用途。</p>
<h3>可變電容器的改良</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>可變電容器祇要能夠旋轉一百八十度的地位，便已足　應用，過多了反覺不便。良好的可變電容器，在電容量最大及最小的地方，都設法使其停止，價賤的便没有此種設備。如果在尋常可變儲電器的　架上，套上一個橡皮圈，那麽也能達到上述的目的。</p>

<h3>告女人</h3>
<p>— 愼言</p>
<p>女人！你們這些時代的　子啊！你們要自由，自由是已在你們的手掌之中了，父母兄弟且不必說，單說你們的配介，他們還能束縛你們嗎？但聞　令愈出愈嚴，縱還聽見有怕丈夫的女人！你們要平等，平等早給你們跳過了。你們出去，丈夫在後面待奉着，捧大衣，提東西，祇要你隨意指揮，他無有不帖然就範地跟着你，</p>
<p>走的；不但丈夫如此，就是别的男人見了你，也往往待得你比待你丈夫更好，更恭敬。這樣下去，總有一天男人顛倒會高唱起平等的口號來的。</p>
<p>再說女子職業，那更是發展得可怕了，你們要找一個位置，眞比男人容易上萬倍，但瞧本報附刋上發表的「自我職業介紹的回音」，十條倒有九條是「某女士鑒」，難得見一條「某君鑒」，可算是奇蹟了。至於那些漂亮的娘兒們，更好了，中英文儘可完全不懂，自有人會出了很高的代價，請你們每天過去坐上幾個鐘頭，什麽事情都不用操心，遲到早退，悉聽尊便　，這更使一般家裏養着三四個男孩子的人，怨得整天長吁而短嘆了。</p>
<p>可借表面上的進步，意是這樣的驚人，而内部的崩潰，却已愈演愈烈；你們的生命和快樂，簡直比舊道德澎漲時代更没有保障了。請瞧吧：報紙上每天所登着的女性自相殘殺的新聞有多少？其最著者如廣東王文舒　割陳嫄貞案和山東某藝術家的婚變案，都極赤裸裸地表現出女性們相互間的妒視而排擠。旣已明知這個男人是早有了妻子，却依舊自私自利地跟他周旋，目的當然是想奪人愛，於是慘殺啊，被棄啊，自盡啊，┆┆一幕一幕的慘劇，終不絶的排演出來了。</p>
<p>所以，我確切的主張女人在高唱自由平等的口號之外，必须同時注意兩點：</p>
<p>㈠别把一切物質上的享受看得太重要，</p>
<p>㈡同性間應有一種最誠摯的同情心。</p>
<p>女人！你們這些時代的驕子啊！你們要享眞正的幸福嗎？這是我嶒給你們的一個救命圈！抓住着吧！</p>
<h3>太平公醮頌</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>時令從熱悶的盛夏，禪位給高爽的秋季，那跟着秋風吹來的景象，除了高等華人的裝飾，有着顯著的變化時，在狹隘的市街的晚上，也照例减少了露宿的勞工。</p>
<p>同時，贫民區域的脊椎動物們，當這薄凉的初秋，剛巧逃也出火獄而得換些流動空氣的時候，他們便慷慨地，踴躍地，省下了買白乾的大錢，移來請吃暈的羽士們唸經，燒大批的錠箔，說是可以禳災致福。祈求太平。可愛的，這愚民的誠信！</p>
<p>甚麽人生在這顚沛流連的世季，感到了世界並没有太平。但希冀太平的幻念。却每一顆心理在這麽饒想。譬如前年洪水汛濫，又遭九一八暴變，於是由政府要人們在南京，在北平，在湖南在江蘇，各地都建築了法壇，有的請活佛，有的請和尙，有的請道士，大家不約而同的在那裏祈禱和平，大打公醮。丨也許塘沽恊定的成功，就賴這些功德　然而長城一帶的血屍，倒底肥養了今夏的草塍。和平女神的脚尖，還是踏在不可知的雲端裏向人間騃笑。那黃河的洪流，不是冲進了東魯？激毁了鐵橋？好不奇怪煞人！</p>
<p>隱約記得二年前，本市當局像禁止過蘭盆勝會。理由是「嚴禁迷信，節省民資」。但人民的冥頑不靈，已是不可醫治的惡習，官樣文章即使「三令五申」但「日久頑生」藐視法令。也不算一回事。又何怪這幾天來，大街小巷的檐廊下，縱橫錯落的密佈着一串一串長錠？一個一個用顔色紙剪成的人形？而且鑼鼓喧　，香烟繚繞？</p>
<p>繼着繼着，或者金剛大法會和戴院長提倡的「祈禱會」，也要「與民合作」應時而起了吧。這眞是個極致太平的年頭！</p>

<h3>大餅的滋味</h3>
<p>— 言</p>
<p>三年以前的一個夏天，有一個朋友要求我代替他敎他兩個兒子識幾個起碼的中國字，可是因爲我有言在先，不受分文的緣故，他就强逼我在他府上吃晚飯，作爲一種報酬。第一個禮拜居然相安無事，不料從第八天晚上起，他又天天逼着我上沙利文，麥瑞，樂鄕┆那些常爲一般高等華人所盤桓的大餐館裏去吃十足的西洋大菜，一連五天，老是麫包，沙濾水，奶油，生菜，吃得我尊胃大倒，意興索然，便跟他據理力爭，並以罷敎爲要挾，他才允許我照　在他府上吃中國飯。</p>
<p>事隔三四個月，情形就大變了。因爲我已從繁華得像大觀園一般的上海搬到了荒凉得彷佛沙漠似的江北某一個小縣中去了。那裏不但没有麫包，奶油，沙濾水，便是尋常的中國飯，也非常簡單，早上更是奉旨不准吃粥，普通人就用大肉麫來代替。我試了一次，却就受不住，後來瞧幾個底下人在那裏，大餅，餅上滾着金黃色的芝蔴，嗅着似乎很香。一問代價，祇是銅元兩枚，當下我就打發下人去買了二個來嘗試嘗試，這一試可就放不下了。原來這種大餅在初出爐的時候，簡直比沙利文的麫包更軟，而他的香甜可口，更非任何一種高價的奶油蛋糕可比。再加他的底部，每因餅師揑製時的手法不同，和爐磚的凹凸不平，往往現着許多橫橫直直的紋路，有的，像草字，有的像現代的漫畫，你不妨一壁咀嚼，一壁賞玩，其不奇趣橫生，愛莫能釋者。我不信也。</p>
<p>雖然，我祇在那裏逕過了三個多月，可是我的大餅的食量，却已從二個一次，增至三個一次，又從三個增至四個了。而且每當吃到末了一個月當兒，往往再三撫弄，半晌不忍入口；就是全吃完了，還得把各個餅上的所掉下來的芝蔴，悉數倒在嘴裏，細細咀嚼，直至把衣袖上帶着的一粒也吃完，才肯歇手。</p>
<p>到現在，我雖然已早從江北回到上海來了，但是每天的早餐，却依舊是大餅三只四只，始終不曾變更過：所差的不過是這種大餅在江北賣兩銅元，在上海賣三銅元而已。如果有人以爲大餅不很潔凈，不妨請上大餅攤去看看，用你的手，試一試那餅的爐子的熱度，就可以相信在大餅上是绝對　有任何一種微生蟲的立足地了。</p>

<p>江氏又走出來，笑着歎了一口氣道：咳！你不知道！昨天晚上，我娘兒倆絆嘴來着，我說了一句，以後全不管，今天他撈我的後腿了。關耀武笑道：這樣子說，正是表妹要你多管呢。那倒很好，我這碗冬瓜湯算是喝成啦。張開大嘴，哈哈大笑一陣。江氏笑道：那麽，你可以放心了，讓我給你一壼好茶，慢慢的談談罷。關耀武摇着手道：别，改日再叨擾罷。我還得趕回營去呢。江氏道：聽趙老太爺說，當連長的人，比兵士自由得多，怎麽你也是這樣忙。關耀武道：軍營裏，無論什麽，都是連長的責任重，就好譬這次檢閱罷。總部裏就是一連一連的檢閱。師長告訴兩個旅長，每個旅長告訴三個團長，每個團長告訴三個營長，每個營長告訴三個連長，他們只要等檢閱委員來，就得啦。連長，就得裏裏外外是忙一陣。一得了檢閱的信，掃地糊窗户，那全不用說，早一個禮拜毛房裏就戒了嚴，洒上臭水舖上石灰。連部墻上的壁子，都得先找瓦匠粉刷起來。譬如我就愛這麽一個面子，軍士的被褥，全給他蒙上白被單，雖說錢出在兵士身上，息己先得墊出來。這次，又算我閙了個大窟窿，墊下去，一百多。這檢閱可不是一天的事得閙整個禮拜，這幾天檢閱委員都是一點半鐘到，我們也就是這個時候，可以抽抽身，時間佔去了，這天就别想走了。今天他們要來得晚一點，所以我抽空來一躺。好在到了明天，也就完了。我是個急性子人，怕這親事，還有什麽障碍，所以不管是怎樣的忙法，我也抽出身子來，跑上這樣一趟。（一六九）</p>

<h3>糧食標粉後市廠空抵補</h3>
<p>昨粉市上午開盤後、各月份曾見疲落之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥跌七八角左右、坎拿大跌一二角不等、開後市氣雖大見鬆軟本月份又一度二角進關、遠期各月份亦較前日回小一分左右、惟實銷方面、略見交易、市氣遂呈定勢、迨至下午開盤、以廠家空頭逐有抵補、且新籌碼亦少放出、客帮亦微有收進使浮多亦隨、跟進、市氣亦步呈俏利、據業中人觀察、此種回頭、仍無補目下積壓之景象也、結果本月份較好七厘半、九十月份好一分、十一月份至一月份各好五厘、</p>
<p>期麥一瀉五六分</p>
<h3>丨大批洋麥待時出檔丨</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、一致回跌、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回　七八角、坎拿舌跌一二角、　　　後、人心卽呈不穏、卽因本月份交割在邇、合格之貨在事前計一百車外、聞目下經廠家軋去、尙有六七十車之譜、業外多頭、鑒於粉銷之寂、及麥市之不振、祇好逐步了結、致遠期各月份因多頭回出、其數甚巨、且上棧之洋麥、除已售九千包以外、聞尙有十萬左右、均待出檔人心之鬆、或卽此故也、結果本月份及九月份較前日均跌六分十月份跌五分、十一月份跌四分、十二月份跌三分、一月份跌一分、現麥以標準逐步狂落、廠胃又復　絶、故金市祇開明光麥七百包、價三元八角四分云、</p>

<h3>五金黑頁鐵銷路銳减</h3>
<p>三十一號黑頁鐵爲北帮秋令之繁銷品、每年銷數、頗爲可觀、今則東北四省被陷、出路銳减而天津·北平·張家口諸路亦無進胃、其他若靑島·烟台諸帮則均在觀望、是以市勢無力活動、行情逐步下游、每檐開十一元六角、比前小去數角、本街搪磁廠生意、近來均無發展之勢、緣此黑頁鐵銷路亦無胃口買進、因之市面一時不易回好也、</p>

<h3>各種捐班</h3>
<p>— 洛文</p>
<p>淸朝的中葉、要做官可以捐，呌做「捐班」的便是這一夥。財主少爺喫得油頭光臉、忽而忙了幾天，頭上就有一粒小晶頂、有時還加上一枝藍　翎、滿口官話，說是「今天天氣好」了。</p>
<p>到得民國，官總算說是没有了捐班，而捐班之塗，實際上倒是　展了起來，連「學士文人」也可以由此弄得到頂戴。開宗明義第一章，自然是要有錢。只要有錢、就什麽都容易辦了。譬如，要捐學偖　罷，那就收買一批古董，結識幾個淸客，並且僱幾個工人，拓出古董上面的花纹和文字，用玻璃板印成一部書，。名之曰「什麽集古錄」或「什麽考古錄」。李富孫做過一部「金石學錄」，是專載研究金石的人們的，然而這倒成了「作俑」，使淸客們可以一續再續，並且推而廣之，連收藏古董，販賣古董的少爺和商人，也都一榻括子的收進去了，這就呌作「金石家」。</p>
<p>捐做「文學家」也用不着新花樣。只要開一隻書占，拉幾個作家，僱一些帮閒，出一種小報，「今天天氣好」是也须會說的，就是寫了出來。印了上去，交給報販，不消一年半載，包管成功。但是，古董的花紋和文字的拓片是不能用的了，應該代以電影明星和摩登女子的照片，因爲這才是新時代的美術。「愛美」的人手在中國還多得很，而「文學家」或「藝術家」也就這樣的起來了。</p>
<p>捐官可以希望刮地皮，但捐學者文人也不會折本。印刷品固然可以賣現錢，古董將來也會有洋鬼子肯出大價的。</p>
<p>這又呌作「名利雙收」。不過先要能「投資」，所以平常人做不到，要不然，文人學士也就不大値錢了。</p>
<p>而現在還値錢，所以也還會有人忙着做人名辭典，造文藝史，出作家論，編自傳。我想，倘作歷史的著作，是應該像將文人分爲羅曼派，古典派一樣，另外分出一種「捐班」派來的，歷史要「眞」，招些忌恨也只好硬挺，是不是？</p>

<p>我的肚裏根本不曾生甚麽刺，不至於不客皂白，逢人便剌他一下！不過因爲旣然生在這個時代裏，礙難旁觀，所有不能咽下去的東西，終得把他吐出來。</p>
<p>照初意，本來也想昻起頭，堂堂皇皇的講幾句老實話，可是事實有所不能。在這個年頭兒，如果一定要說「二加二等於四」，那就是不合時宜的了；如果要我跟著别人說「二加二等於五」，那也辦不到；於是我只能說；「二加二等於五減一」。</p>
<p>這便是我所以有些諷刺意味的原因。　　於此可見我之所以刺，我之所以說「二加二等於五减一」，並非出於本意。我從不想自炫地賣弄些小聰敏，郤熱望著我的以及和我同樣的見解，早些「歸天」，好讓「正經統一剩下的全中國」。</p>
<p>但須要不是「二加二等於五」才好。</p>
<p>如今社會上，「二加二等於五」是很流行的，因爲流行，大家非但不覺其錯，反而像是有些對了。「二加二等於五」旣然對，於是「二加二等於四」就非錯不可了。</p>
<p>所以，「二加二等於四」是胡說，是搗亂，全是些要不得的！</p>
<p>從前聽說有人因爲没錢贿賂贓官，被捉去拷打；這個人並不痛駡贓官貪污，郤低聲的怪自己太窮。說「二加二等於五减一」，也有這種風味。雖然還不免是異端，可是郤已經没有直接的敵對行爲了。便是刺，爲顧全顔面起見，也還可以隠忍的。</p>
<p>而且，即使在隠忍不住的時候，因爲去的是剌，所以回敬的也就是刺，雖然此刺已經是能夠結果性命的槍刺或刀刺，但終還不免是刺；究竟不能高舉靑龍偃月，明光光的，大喝一聲「殺！」。</p>
<p>因爲有這些便宜，所以在旣不容說「二加二等於四」，又不願說「二加二等於五」的當兒，我只能說：「二加二等於五减一」。</p>
<h3>西風廟</h3>
<p>— 亢德</p>
<p>到浦鎭原是看看久病新痊的賢的，但因了鄕村的秋色惹人，便也不待他的勸留就住下了。</p>
<p>村郊的秋色眞是惹人：那纎雲不染的藍碧晴空，那淸得見底的潺潺河水，那如秃頭老兒的樹林，那散落在地上，如新妝少婦般凄艶的紅葉┊┊使我們迎着朝日在田野間漫步見到時，往往消除去心頭的滿斛塵愁，而感到生的喜悅。　　不但村郊的秋色惹人，便是賢的被籠在温情雰圍之中的家庭，也使一個少小離家長年漂泊如我的人置身其間，覺得可以安居，可以留戀。他的髮埀白了的母親是那末慈靄，他的年少的妹妹是那末婉變，我想：就在這兒安居了吧，别再孤零零地去流寓在城市中的僻巷幽弄中了。然而，這僅僅是一個夢想，到得三天之後，我又孤負了他們全家的堅留，不聲不說的重返Ｘ城了！</p>
<p>那就是第三天的午後。我和賢正閒坐在屋後的廢園中，那時澹澹的秋陽無力地曬在我們身上，小雀兒在败蓬的南瓜棚間咕啾，幾枝待謝的菊花給微風吹過顫巍巍的點幾下頭。忽地他的老母親也進來了，來收拾晒在園中的芥菜的。</p>
<p>「亢少爺」他忽然對我說，在收拾過芥菜之後。「你老太太多大歲數了？」</p>
<p>這句話把我怔住了，離家八年，竟連母親的歲數也巳忘記，追思了一忽之後，才回答她：「我祇記得屬牛的。」</p>
<p>「今年五十二」，他算了算代我說出。</p>
<p>接着又問：「可有我這樣老？」</p>
<p>「娘也眞會問」，賢插嘴說，「他八年不歸家了，怎麽能知道老得怎樣。」</p>
<p>「八年不歸家了？」她驚嘆起來。「亢少爺家裏弟妹們多的吧？」</p>
<p>多已經有些黯然，勉强的回答：「我是兄弟姊妹一個也没有的」。</p>
<p>「那眞是寳貝兒子了！」她說畢忽然注視住賣默然了，臉上含看微笑，我想，</p>
<p>喲！你雖病，但我們母子　　　　　　」</p>
<p>久鬱在心底鄕愁　發起來了，這天的晚飯祗吃了一點點，也不再和往日一樣的和賢在燈下茗話些時，就獨個兒上樓睡下。</p>
<p>蒙着被頭在床上暗泣着，隔室賢母子們的親切絮談，一句句的傳來，一句句我聽了滴出一串串的涙珠。啊！母親，我幾時才能夠和你團聚在一塊親親熱熱的絮談啊！</p>
<p>翌日早晨，我在理一束寫有幾千字的稿箋時，賢的母親也起來了，他告訴我說夜來我在夢中鳴鳴的哭喊。</p>
<p>當天我就在颯颯西風裏重返了Ｘ州。</p>
<h3>山居雜話（續）</h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>㈡兩個世界</p>
<p>「兩個世界的對立，」這是我們常聽到的話，這兩個世界，是資本主義的國家與社會主義的國家。我這兒所說的也是「兩個世界的對立，」但這「對立，」却不　　　　　　　　　　　「是　吳記」裏。所說的故事。在「　軒吳記」　，有一段說：</p>
<p>景泰甲戌，吳多雪。正月望日，一　　夕積七八尺。比　，城郭塡咽，民居被壓。　側者覆，縛茅者穿，楝樑之綿而　者咸折。通衢委巷，僵而臥者，比比皆是，突而烟者，十二三而已。郡守隴右注滸以爲祥命　雪爲獅，相持府治東西墀，高可盈丈，嵌兩晴以巨　、　毛爪　，設色而爲。汪喜溢眉宇，合府衛，　寮相宴賞，張燈　市，飭優爲戲，簫鼓聲徹明始息。┊┊</p>
<p>這裏記着的，不明明是兩個絶對相反的「世界」麽？「朱門酒肉臭，路有凍死骨，」像這樣的「兩個世界的對立，」是從古到今的。就是現在，也多的是「吳記」裏所說的「居民，」也多的是「吳記」裏所說的「汪郡守。」畢竟現在到底是現在，這「兩個世界，」居民是並不像古時的「文質彬彬，」郡守也更進一步的「窮兇極惡，」因此，他們是進而相互的肉搏了。看究竟誰是最後的勝利者罷！</p>
<h3>女人（二）</h3>
<p>— 沈從文</p>
<p>「把我拾起來的，我名字呌作「毋忘我草」。」</p>
<p>她　下腰把牠拾起來。</p>
<p>一張猪肝色的扁臉，從肩膊邊擦過去。一個毛子軍人把一雙碧眼似乎很情的慾望著這女人一會，她彷佛感到了侮辱，怱怱的就走了。</p>
<p>不到一會，三樓三百十七號病房外，就有隻帶著灰色絲質手套的纎手，輕輕的扣著門。　面並無聲音，但她仍然輕輕的推開了那房門。門開後，她見到那個病人正披了白包睡衣，對窗外望，把背向著門邊。似乎正在想到某樣事情，或爲某種景物　入玄思，故來了客人，他却全不注意。</p>
<p>她輕輕的把門掩上，輕輕的走近那病人身邊，且輕輕的說：</p>
<p>「我來了。」</p>
<p>病人把頭掉回，便笑了。</p>
<p>「我正想到爲什麽秋天來得那麽快。你看窗外那株楊柳。」</p>
<p>穿綠衣的聽到這句話，似乎忽然中了一擊，心中刺了一下。裝作病人所說的話與彼無關係的神氣，温柔的笑着。</p>
<p>「少想些，秋來了，你認識牠就得了，並不需要你想牠。」</p>
<p>「不想牠，能認識牠嗎？」</p>
<p>女人於是輕輕的略帶解嘲的神氣那麽說：</p>
<p>「譬如人，有些人你認識她就並不必去想她！」</p>
<p>「坐下來，不要這樣說罷。這是如　小姐說话的風格，昨天不是早已說好不許這樣嗎？」</p>
<p>病人把如　小姐拉在一張有靠手的椅子旁坐下，便站在她面前，揑著那兩隻手不放：</p>
<p>「你爲什麽知道我不正在念你？」</p>
<p>女人嘴唇略張，绽出兩排白色小貝，披著優美捲　頭略歪，做出的神氣，正像一個小姑娘常作的社氣。</p>
<p>病人說：</p>
<p>「你眞像小孩子。」</p>
<p>「我像小孩子嗎／」</p>
<p>「你是小孩子！」</p>
<p>「那麽，你是個大人了。」</p>
<p>「可是我今年還只二十二歲。」</p>
<p>「但你有些方面。眞是個二十二歲的大人。」</p>
<p>「你是不是說我世故？」</p>
<p>「我說我不如你那麽┊┊」</p>
<p>「得了。病人走過窗邊去，背過了女，眉頭輕微蹙了一下。回過頭來時就說：「我想出院了，那醫生不讓我走。」</p>
<p>女人說：「忙什麽？」隨卽又說，「我見到那看護，她也說會醫生以爲你還不能出去。」</p>
<p>「我心裏燥得很。我還有許多事┊┊」</p>
<p>「你好些没有？睡得好不好？」</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談禮</h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>「禮」不是本質的缺陷，而是一貫的因襲所演變出來的流弊之可惡。我不是「國粹」的附和者，却也不是批販「外貨」的盲從人。我只覺得「國粹」與「外貨」是　樣不可一　妄估其好歹，甚至咬牙怒目，悻悻然硬下某種的袒護。</p>
<p>不待說，「禮」是咱們的「國粹」，雖說是國粹，但文明如歐美各民族，野蠻如苗撞　等，也各有其「禮」。不過古色古香的咱國，「禮」歷代來得風尙，來得有　績。確實的，自周公以逮今茲，全世界恐首推中華民族最愛講「禮」了。</p>
<p>本來「禮」這種形　，乃是封建産物：泪至資本主義的現社會，也還能存在，甚至較尤爲盛，直是一回費解的事。</p>
<p>我並不反對講「禮」，比如小學堂裏用藍底铅皮，白粉書寫着的這一類的禮訓：「路遇先生要鞠躬行禮；遇同學要招呼！」我是極表贊同的。如上海的一般商店，你如衣着破舊，踏着闊氣的少爺小姐的後影跟了進去想買點東西，必然的那兒的店員們是不會與你多問答，甚至會给你一陣白眼，傲慢，害得你侷促不堪，這種只趨勢利而不懂禮講禮的店員，實在錯誤，又如前樓與後樓，亭子間與三層擱的普通寓公，雖已同居經年，面熟心照，打邊過也總不打招呼，没有問答，不通往來，禍福之事，毫不關顧，也如一般店員之傲慢不講「禮」，同出一轍。這些，我都視爲不對。</p>
<p>但如北平的一些商店店員，對待顧客，只要你進了他們的店，不論買没買東西，總得禮恭至敬的送你出店，却又實在過於煩瑣了，虚僞使人同樣的害於侷促，也非得宜。</p>
<p>最是社會上一般中等以上的人們，過分的講禮，禮尙往來，更斵喪了禮的本質</p>
<p>兩年前，記得在一個老同學家裏，正當過年，他買了大籃的年糕，去达節一個同事，我問他爲什麽要這樣煩瑣，浪費，他說因爲他已先送來過了，不得不回報，這是「禮」，更是禮尙往來。據我們想，過年而能送送賀年片，已足夠表示「禮」意了，何必要虚僞，煩瑣，浪費的你來我去的送節？至於上等階級的人家，更不止單送年糕，各種各樣的禮品，送個不停呢。</p>
<p>因爲此風一長，就是你今天來看了我一次，我明天無事也得去走訪你，昨天他請你吃飯，後天必然的你要復席，推而至於一切的賀生喜慶，無不攘攘然禮尙往來。這些，我也都視爲不對。</p>
<p>於此可知，禮講得太甚，則近於僞，不足便又是傲，僞與傲，是同樣的極端欠妥。至此我要呌一聲不願呌的「中庸」，就是禮要得乎其「中」。</p>
<p>禮要得乎其中，需要注意幾點：</p>
<p>㈠發乎性，止於自然，不要强勉，虚僞</p>
<p>㈡禮之往還，没有尊卑貴賤之分，只有長幼親疏之别。</p>
<p>　㈢禮要隨生活爲轉移。隨時代而進化，不要拘泥於成禮。</p>
<h3>苦笑</h3>
<p>— 厚英</p>
<p>這是一個多麽美的初夏之夜啊，大自然完全展開了牠的眞面目。月兒，温柔地放出淸凉的光；星兒，燦爛地嵌在漆黑的空中；水兒，寗靜地潺潺的流着；微風吹來，細枝迎月而舞；水波輕漾樹影到映而　；還有：小鳥細鳴牠們的淸歌；草蟲高唱牠們的樂曲；┊┊一切都沉醉在宇宙的眞諦裏，一切都是甜蜜的愉快；這是任何個詩人的腦中所没有想像過的美景，這是任何個小說家筆底下不能形容的美景。天地似乎也都大張着笑臉，欣欣然嘆賞這世界上還有如此眞實的快樂。</p>
<p>然而，世事是無常的。在這淸靜的天空中，忽然從地平線下飛過來一朶鳥雲；是這樣飛的快，一霎間後，馬上黑沉沉地蓋住了這個愉快的世界。微風變做了暴風，呼呼地刮得樹身動摇；雷聲閧閧的響着，似乎在頭顶上擂鼓；墨一般的蒼穹，閃閃地發出淸而且白的電光。雖然尚没有下雨，可是這景象却比下雨時更可怕。星與月，都躱進了鳥雲裏面，也許牠們不忍見這幕可慘的殺刼？鳥兒的細鳴，蟲兒的高唱，這時候，全都停止了；所聽見的，只有一種輕微的悲鳴。總之，一切都變了，天空是多麽的慘淡！</p>
<p>終於，大雨下來了。銅元般大，一點點，一絲絲，在昏黑的夜間不住地下着。風，狂風，一陣又一陣的接連着刮，刮，刮！鳥兒嚇得伏在巢中，蟲兒駭得逃回窠内；但是，有什麽用？狂風要吹掉你的巢，暴雨要淹没你的窠！小蟲兒，小鳥兒，你們往那裏逃？整個的世界，都是這樣丨狂風，暴雨，雷聲，閃電丨這許多，要打掉你的生命，要無理的打掉你們的生命！啊！你們還是乖乖地躺下來，靜靜地受宰割罷！你們不能逃，你們也不用想逃，看呵！這蒼茫茫的一片，那兒有光明？天無門，地無路，將奈何？你們看見過光明麽？也許看見過的。但是，光明現在已經逃去了丨牠躱在這黑暗的外面，你們不能看見牠了！你們没有勇氣打破這黑暗，你們没有毅力繼長這勇氣，你們要永遠得不到光明，永遠受别人的屠殺！奮鬥吧！雖然免不了流血，雖然免不了死亡，但是光明就在那黑暗的後面呢！┊┊唉！疲弱的小東西！</p>
<p>岡了有一個小時，狂風小了，暴雨息了，雷聲弱了，閃電滅了；鳥雲也過去了。雖然說不定何時再突然來演一齣，但是暫時總算是很太平。鳥雲的後面，星與月露出面來，燦爛淸凉的光，依然如故；水兒；寗靜而又活潑地，潺潺的流着，也依然如故。萬物都如故；然而；小鳥兒，小蟲兒的歌聲却没有了。狂風暴雨的恩典，使牠們的同伴死了，使牠們的房屋破了；牠們只有悲哀，那兒再能興高采烈地歌唱？微風輕輕地吹，雨珠兒慢慢地點，牠們的心胸中藏滿了莫大的悲哀。雖然牠們是弱者·丨没有勇氣反抗這粗暴不講理的强盜丨但是牠們的悲哀是誰都不能阻止的。不過與其說牠們是悲哀，不如說牠們只能苦笑來得更確當些。苦笑，苦笑，永遠的苦笑！苦笑牠們自己，苦笑牠們的同伴。唉！這弱者的悲哀！</p>

<h3>Precarious Situation of Dikes and Embankments in Lower Reaches of the Yellow River</h3>
<p>Water Outside Dong'a City Reaches Eight Feet Deep</p>
<p>Zhang Lianjia Rushes Back to Luokou to Supervise Emergency Repair Work</p>
<p>Civilian Embankment at Dongjiaqiao, Changqing Breached for Ten Zhang</p>
<p>(Jinan) A telegram from Dong'a reports that the Yellow River water outside the city walls is eight feet deep, surging into the city. Fortunately, the gates were lowered to block it. Villagers have fled to the tops of trees and roofs. Cries of cold and weeping can be heard everywhere. A telegram from downstream reports that the lower part of the Yuwangkou Dam has collapsed, with water reaching the roots of the Majiazi Dike. At Xieziawan, water is flowing over the willow embankment. In the middle reaches, the side of the Wangjiayao Great Embankment has collapsed and subsided. This morning, the situation is most critical at Beiluokou in the areas of Qihe and Changqing. The water level at Luokou has reached 31.3 meters. The soil on the north bank is particularly loose and dangerous. By evening, the water had stopped rising, so there is no immediate danger. Zhang Lianjia is traveling back and forth between Qihe, Changqing, and Luokou, supervising emergency repair work. Even young children are braving the wind and rain to help with the emergency work. Jinan Mayor Wen Cheng Lie has given a special award. A telegram from Fan County reports that out of 104 schools in the county, 50 have been flooded. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the Yellow River in the middle and lower reaches is still rising. In the middle reaches, the water level at Luokou has risen by 2.2 cm, reaching 31.25 meters. In the lower reaches, the water level at Damajia has risen by 1 inch, reaching 15.4 meters. Water is flowing over the embankment at Wangjiayao, more than ten li west of Luokou. Much of the civilian embankment opposite the Qihe city gate has been flooded. The river surface is over twenty li wide. The civilian embankment at Dongjiaqiao, Changqing, has breached for ten zhang, and the water is reaching the base of the main dike. Emergency protection work is underway. Zhang Lianjia has rushed back to Luokou from downstream to supervise the emergency repair work. Xu Xinong, a member of the river bureau, has been dispatched from the interior to inspect the situation from upstream to Jinan, and then on to Lanfeng. According to river bureau personnel, although the current situation is tense, the river's course has not changed, and the dikes have not collapsed. If the water does not continue to rise, there should be no danger. In recent years, residents along the river have built small embankments to protect their land from water, which has impeded water flow and caused widespread flooding. It is hoped that the water level at Luokou will drop tonight. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the River Bureau received a telegram from the Shaanxi Hydrological Station reporting a water level of 292 meters, a drop of 1.97 meters compared to the 19th. The Yellow River in this province is expected to experience a significant drop in water levels in the next few days, turning danger into safety. People's hearts are greatly relieved. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Feng Yong arrived in Jinan yesterday. Today, he and Tong Gang flew to Luokou to inspect the water situation and returned to Qingdao in the evening. Feng said he will return to Jinan in a week to fly to Beijing. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Zhang Lianjia went to inspect the downstream areas and reported to the provincial government on the 24th that the flow was fierce in the areas of Lijia and Wangzaojia in Huimin County. Embankments in various sections were either overflowing or at water level, facing increasing pressure. He has ordered an additional 200,000 jin of civilian materials to be rushed to reinforce the defenses. At Zhaojia Dam in Weixian County, the water is pressing against the base of the dike. At Yuwangkou in Qidong County, the water flow is strong, and the newly built dams have experienced some collapse. At Xiaowangzhuang Fifth Embankment in Lijin County, the flow is sweeping the edge, causing slight erosion. At Damajia, the main flow is directly impacting the embankment, causing it to overflow. Although the situation is critical, if the water does not continue to rise, there should be no danger, he said. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) A telegram from Shou Zhang reports that as the water recedes, drowning deaths among fleeing refugees are still being reported from time to time. However, the morale inside the city is gradually improving. (Central News Agency dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Li Mingyang Goes to Hanzhuang to Inspect the Water Situation Entering the Canal from Weishan Lake</h3>
<p>The Situation on the Liutang River Is Critical</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Li Mingyang, accompanied by She Nianci, went to Hanzhuang on the morning of the 25th to inspect the water situation in the Grand Canal, returning to Xuzhou that evening. Li said that upon arriving at Hanzhuang Station, the water level in the Grand Canal was very low, about ten zhang from the bank. He then went to Hanzhuang Town to inspect the flow of water entering the canal from Weishan Lake. The water flow at both sluice gates was also very gentle. He also took a boat to inspect the lake, which has a large capacity and showed no signs of sudden flooding. Based on the situation, he estimated that even if water from western Shandong enters the Weishan Canal, it would probably not cause much harm. However, until the breaches in Dongming and other places are closed, he could not definitively say that the situation was optimistic. Li's inspection is largely complete, and he will return to the province in a few days. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Li Mingyang of the Jiangsu Provincial Committee, accompanied by She Nianci and others, went from Xuzhou to Hanzhuang on the morning of the 25th to inspect the situation of the waterways entering the Grand Canal from Weishan Lake, in order to prepare for any eventuality in the central section of the Grand Canal. He is expected to return to Xuzhou that evening. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Wen Qinming, the Administrative Commissioner of the 13th District of Haizhou, recently received a telegram from County Magistrate Feng of Suqian reporting that the Yellow River water flowing into the canal and downstream into the Liutang River poses a critical situation. In addition to mobilizing the people to protect the canal dikes, a special request has been made to order the repair of the Liutang River. Commissioner Wen immediately telegraphed the county magistrates of Muyang and Guanyun, ordering them to quickly repair the Liutang River dikes to prevent flooding, and to report back regularly. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Zhi Chun at Qingjiang Sluice Gate dropped three cun on the 25th, with the water level at two zhang two chi two cun. Also, the Pishui River dropped three zhi, remaining at eight chi six cun. A telegram from Pei County reports that the water in Zhaoyang and Weishan Lakes is deepest, about five chi. The dikes have been reinforced, but the water level is still rising sharply at various openings in Henan and Hebei. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Henan River Affairs Bureau telegraphed various openings on both banks of Hebei and Henan on the 25th, stating that although there are many places for discharge, the water level in each section is still rising sharply from noon on the 24th. The water level is 60.3 meters above the Dagukou sea level, which is 1.16 cm higher than the highest water level last year, and it is still rising rapidly. It is currently ordering additional reinforcement. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Xu Dingkang, the Director of the Jiangbei Canal Works Bureau, recently telegraphed the Provincial Government, stating that the County Magistrate of Suxian is personally commanding more than 20,000 laborers to urgently build many important projects on the Yellow Canal and Liutang Canal, so Suqian is safe. He also requested permission from the Northern Canal Commissioner to plan the opening of the six dams on the Panhe River to alleviate the crisis on the Liutang River. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Proposal of the Six Provinces Flood Prevention Conference to the Jiangsu Provincial Government</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Jiangsu Provincial Government telegraphed the Six Provinces Flood Prevention Conference on the 25th, proposing six items to be included in the agenda. The contents are: 1. Requesting reference to the established case of the Jianghuai floods in 1931, requesting the central government to establish a National Government Flood Relief Committee to handle the unified authority of Yellow River work relief. 2. Post-disaster reconstruction projects should prioritize closing the breaches in Henan, Hebei, and Shandong. 3. Requesting dredging of flooded areas. 4. Requesting allocation of funds for emergency repairs of flooded river dikes downstream. 5. Proposing the addition of a Jiangsu Provincial Committee member to the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. 6. Suggesting the establishment of a Yellow River Downstream Regulation Committee. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Yellow River Bridge Fully Repaired</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Pinghan Railway Yellow River bridge has been repaired. Traffic has completely returned to normal today. Tickets for the 11th passenger train and the 71st freight train are being sold to Hankou. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Appeals for Closing the Dongming Breach</h3>
<p>Shandong Public Organizations Request Punishment of Dike Breaching Personnel</p>
<p>Borrowing and Allocating One Million in National Taxes for Relief</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuqu today again telegraphed Lin, Jiang, Wang, and the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, stating: "Upon investigation, the breach in Dongming, Hebei Province, has been open for nearly a month, turning half of western Shandong into a watery realm. If this breach is not quickly closed, the winter season will soon arrive. Over ten million people in the disaster area have no clothes or food and will only face freezing and starvation. Therefore, closing the breach is the primary and urgent issue. With funds, the breach can be closed immediately; it is not a difficult task. If this small expense is begrudged, and the delay continues, it will not affect those who live in comfort and wealth. However, the people who are called the masters of the country are left to live in surging waves. They cannot find a piece of dry land or even get a ration of chaff. Anyone with blood in their veins cannot help but feel pain. Some say that I am a military man with an impatient temperament. In fact, a breach in the Yellow River is a major event for one province, but to spend several million yuan to save tens of millions of people is not a difficult matter in theory and should not be delayed in reason. Taking advantage of the clear autumn weather, we should estimate the work, purchase materials, and recruit laborers while holding meetings in Xuzhou, Kaifeng, or Jining Yanzhou to discuss the matter. Within a month, the breach could be closed, so that the flooded areas would have no source of water, and the people could live and work in peace. Afterwards, we can make detailed plans on how to address the root causes and how to manage the symptoms to achieve a lasting solution. The immediate task is to save lives. Since hearing of the flood, I have been unable to sleep or eat. As a military man, I am unaware of taboos and dare to speak plainly. I beg for your forgiveness and adoption of my suggestions. The telegram is urgent, and I await your orders. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, respectfully presents this telegram." (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Provincial Relief Association, the Chamber of Commerce, various trade associations, the Buddhist Association, and the Western Shandong Flood Relief Association and other organizations stated that this Yellow River breach was caused by someone openly breaching the dike. They telegraphed Lin, Jiang, Wang, Yu Youren, Sun Ke, etc., stating, "This breach in a neighboring province has brought disaster to western Shandong, affecting dozens of counties, causing 2 million casualties. The victims have no one to turn to. What is the intention of those who breached the dike? How can they face the residents? We request the government to openly dismiss and investigate the personnel who advocated breaching the dike to correct the injustice and comfort the victims. We also request that the Shandong Provincial Government be clearly ordered to temporarily allocate one million yuan from the national tax revenue, salt tax, and tobacco and alcohol revenue to handle the flood relief after the disaster." The wording of the original telegram was extremely fierce. (Special dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Representatives of disaster victims from 18 counties in western Shandong, including Heze, telegraphed the Central Executive Committee and Lin, Jiang, Wang, Yu Sunke, and others, explicitly stating that a certain chairman breached the dike and caused disaster in Shandong, requesting a declaration of laws and discipline to rectify the officials and appease the public's anger.

<h3>Affiliation of Water Conservancy Agencies Undecided</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the affiliation of water conservancy agencies, there were three different opinions last time: under the Ministry of Interior, under the National Economic Council, or an independent establishment. The case was resolved by the Political Council and submitted to the Executive Yuan for deliberation. After consideration, the Executive Yuan has not yet made a decision. If it is affiliated with the Ministry of Interior, it must use a committee system, with the Minister of Interior as the chairman of the committee. If it is directly under the Executive Yuan, a chairman or water conservancy supervisor must be selected. Both options will be submitted to the Central Political Council to decide on one.

<h3>Reorganization of the Chahar Army Reaches a Stage</h3>
<p>Song Reaches Agreement with Various Commanders</p>
<p>Disbandment and Rehabilitation Funds Distributed Separately</p>
<p>Jiang Bocheng and Others Arrive in Zhangjiakou</p>
<p>Song Promises to Protect the Lives and Safety of Fang Ji</p>
<p>(Beiping) Funds for the Chahar armies have been distributed and handed over to representatives to be taken back and distributed. After the reorganization methods are agreed upon, each army will immediately implement the reorganization and consolidation. The various army units are now gathered in the Zhangbei area. Song is scheduled to personally inspect the armies in Zhangbei in a day or two. Because Zhangbei is strategically important, a unit of the 29th Army will be sent to garrison the area. It has been decided that those who are disbanded will be given funds and sent back to their hometowns to prevent them from wandering and disturbing the local area. The Military Affairs Commission recently allocated 150,000 yuan for military expenses in Chahar, which Song has divided into 50,000 yuan for ten days' worth of living expenses and 100,000 yuan for resettlement expenses. The training corps that Feng had established in Zhang has already been sent back to Beiping to be disbanded. Fearing that communists have infiltrated Fang Ji's troops, Ruan Xuanwu and Zhang Yunrong have been tasked with suppressing them. Seven communists have been captured from Fang's troops in recent days and have been sent to Zhangjiakou for interrogation. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

At 10:00 AM yesterday, Song convened representatives of various generals at the provincial government to conduct a final consultation, which resulted in excellent results. Ruan Xuanwu and Zhang Yunrong returned to Zhangbei this morning to report to Fang Ji and others. The reorganization of the Chahar army can be resolved in a short period of time. He came here to report the negotiated situation to He. Yang said that the reorganization of the Chahar army has reached a stage. He came here to take care of personal affairs. After Song arrived in Zhangjiakou, in addition to actively handling the reorganization of miscellaneous troops, he also began to address political matters, selecting county magistrates with experience in governing and sending them to various counties to thoroughly reorganize the local areas. Tang's unit did not surrender to the puppet state. The unit was originally stationed on the border of Rehe and has now arrived in Guyuan, sending representatives to visit Song to request accommodation. It may be possible to accommodate them. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the aftermath in Chahar, since Song and Xiong arrived in Zhang, they have been telegraphing to various army generals for days, summoning them to Zhangjiakou to discuss everything. All the generals, except Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, and Liu Guitang, who sent representatives, arrived one after another. The results of the consultation were largely decided. Ji's representative Zhang Yunrong and Fang's representative Ruan Xuanwu arrived in Zhang to meet with Song. Song is willing to be responsible for protecting the lives and safety of Ji and Fang. Ruan telegraphed this idea to Fang for instructions. It is planned to go abroad for investigation and study. Ruan and Zhang are scheduled to go to Zhangbei this morning to meet Fang and Ji to report on their missions. Song has distributed the demobilization and rehabilitation funds for the various armies separately. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Chahar armies are reorganized, the issue of their salaries has not been determined. Jiang Bocheng and Hou arrived in Zhangjiakou at night and have discussed this with Song.

If he is physically fit, he would like to travel to southern Xinjiang and the west to understand the situation in the border areas, so that the government can refer to them when dealing with diplomacy and political installations. If time and the environment permit, he also plans to go to Mongolia. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Luo Wengan made the following statement to the Central News Agency reporter before his departure: "I am going on a long journey to Xinjiang, which will be a temporary farewell to the capital. I have been ordered to go to Xinjiang to convey the central government's intentions, and to meet with the authorities of Xinjiang and the leaders of various ethnic groups, in order to unite the people and consolidate the border. I plan to go to Dihua first, and then go to southern Xinjiang for inspection. However, the traffic on the southern route of Tianshan is blocked and travel is inconvenient. It may take two or three months to return to Dihua. On the way back, I plan to take the road through Mongolia and Suiyuan to return to Beijing, but the date of return to Beijing cannot be determined yet. Ambassador to Russia Yan Huiqing did send a telegram asking me to meet him in Xinjiang." (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Yu Xuezhong Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>President Wang Hosted a Banquet to Welcome Him</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 25th. He visited Lin and Wang to report on the recent situation in North China, and met with Chen Yi to discuss the reorganization of the miscellaneous troops in North China. Wang hosted a banquet in the evening to welcome Yu. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Yu Xuezhong arrived in Nanjing at 1:30 PM on the 25th on the Jiangshun ferry. He Yaozu, Chu Minyi, Lu Chao, Zhang Lisheng, Chen Zhuo, Wang Yingyu, Wei Daofeng, Gao Lingbai, and other 20 people welcomed him. Police and gendarmes were stationed along the pier. After landing, he took a car with Chu Minyi, Zhang Lisheng, Gao Lingbai, and others to the Lizhi Society. According to Yu in Lizhi Society's interview with Central News Agency reporters, this trip to Jiangxi to visit Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was to report on the recent situation in North China. The takeover of the war zone has been completed in sequence, except for Linyu, Dushan, and Xinglong counties, which have not been completely taken over. Dushan is outside the Great Wall, and Xinglong is also mostly outside the Great Wall. The remnants of Li Jichun, Shi Yousan, and others are scattered in the Luandong area and are currently under negotiation. It is hoped that we will completely take over. Shanhaiguan is still stationed by a brigade of Japanese troops, who will also withdraw. Japanese troops plan to withdraw from the five passes of the Great Wall. This was only reported in the newspapers, and it is what we hope for. There is a whole plan for rescuing the war zone, but it needs sufficient funds to be effective. Even with 5 million for rescue, it is still not enough. However, the central government is in financial difficulty and has allocated 1 million yuan, which shows their hard work. The treasury bonds are guaranteed by the water conservancy income of Hebei Province and will be repaid in four years, but they still belong to Hebei Province. In Jiangxi, he discussed the issue of funding with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, who also found it difficult to raise large amounts of money for the time being. Hebei Province has suffered war disasters. More than a dozen counties in Luandong are suffering from war, and the bandit disasters have spread recently. The war zone has also suffered floods and insect plagues. It is planned to gradually provide relief. Hebei's civil administration is on the right track, and the official administration is gradually becoming clearer. The construction of industries has almost come to a standstill due to the war. Education has also been affected. It will gradually recover in the future. If no accidents occur, it should be able to return to normal in a year. Zhang Hanqing will not return to China for the time being, and the Northeast Army will maintain its original state. Since Chairman Song returned to Chahar, he has gradually sought political and military reorganization. Fang Ji and other units are also easy to control and will not become a problem. This is my first time in Nanjing, so I came to visit Chairman Lin, President Wang, and the central government officials. I plan to return to Tianjin in about a week. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gao Lingbai hosted a banquet for Yu Xuezhong at the Central Hotel at noon on the 25th. Yu paid his respects to Chairman Lin in the afternoon. President Wang hosted a banquet at his official residence on the evening of the 25th to welcome Yu. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Since Mayor Zhou Longguang resigned from his position as mayor of Tianjin, Yu Xuezhong has been temporarily appointed. Now that Yu is burdened with provincial affairs, he has decided to resign from his concurrent post. It is reported that Yu will recommend a successor to the central government during this trip to Nanjing. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen's Transit Through Japan and China's Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>Since the announcement of Foreign Minister Luo Wengan's order to inspect Xinjiang, Japan has not only taken the opportunity to widely spread rumors about a change in China's diplomatic policy, but domestic circles have also been filled with doubts that repeated verbal clarifications from the authorities have failed to dispel. More recently, rumors have emerged that Song Ziwen will return to China from Europe and that he plans to visit key Japanese figures en route. For a time, the nation's gaze has shifted to Song himself, using his words and actions during his transit through Japan to infer whether there are signs of a change in the direction of Sino-Japanese diplomacy. Yesterday morning, Song arrived in Yokohama, Japan. His refusal to disembark and meet with Japanese reporters is enough to make the authorities' intentions somewhat clear to the nation. Although we cannot know how Song will act during his two days in Japan, the relationship between Song's personal actions and the nation's diplomatic policy must be clarified.</p>
<p>The foundation of China's diplomatic policy is the foreign policy adopted by the First National Congress of the Kuomintang. This is not only what the current authorities should guide, but also what the people of the whole country are sincerely safeguarding. Luo Wengan's statement during his tenure as Foreign Minister that "it is absolutely impossible to express the most cordial friendship with those who use military force to invade" was in fact a document based on the nation's fundamental diplomatic policy, and not Luo's personal words. Even if a nation's diplomatic policy cannot remain unchanged, it must be able to obtain the consent of the majority of the people in order to proceed without hindrance. To attempt to change diplomatic relations between two countries with unresolved animosity based on one person's intentions is either a delusion of personal ability or a contempt for national public opinion. No modern politician has been so reckless. In order to discern whether there are signs of a change in the direction of Sino-Japanese diplomacy, it is not necessary to focus on Song, who is far across the Yellow Sea. One only needs to examine the domestic situation regarding Japan to make a judgment.</p>
<p>In the history of international diplomacy over the past decade, there have been precedents for reluctantly engaging with hostile countries. During the Stresemann era, Germany signed humiliating treaties with the Allied Powers. The Soviet Union's Litvinov also frequented gatherings of imperialists who were clearly hostile. However, Stresemann was able to exploit the European fear of German redization created by Rathenau to benefit from the situation. Litvinov was able to see through the inability of various imperialists to coordinate, thereby dispersing their united offensive lines. Both were supported by the German and Russian people. What does China have to offer in its dealings with Japan? Since the establishment of the Tanggu Truce, Japan's goal has been to implement its diplomatic policy to seek amity among Japan, Manchukuo, and China. If China were to change its long-standing policy, it would only be expressing submission and placing itself among the ranks of the puppet organization. Not only would the people of the whole country find this difficult to agree to, but even those as intelligent as Song and his peers would certainly not mistakenly go astray. Moreover, Vice Foreign Minister Tang has already declared that the central government's diplomatic policy will never change, which is something the people of the country can rest assured about.</p>
<p>Song Ziwen Passes Through Yokohama</p>
<h3>Jiang Benhua and Others Arrive at the Dock to Welcome Him; Japanese Reporters' Request to Meet Him is Rejected</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Minister of Finance Song and his entourage of eight arrived in Yokohama at six o'clock this morning aboard the President Jefferson. The entire group did not disembark. A group of Japanese reporters went on board to request a meeting, but Song Ziwen refused to meet them and also did not issue any statements. (China United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Yokohama Chinese Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, who is attending the World Economic Conference and returning home after visiting various European countries, arrived in Yokohama at 6:00 a.m. on the 25th aboard the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Jefferson, accompanied by Chinese financial advisor Dr. Young, secretaries Huang and Cai, and other entourage members. Jiang Benhua, the acting Chinese envoy to Japan, Guo Min, the Chinese Consul General in Yokohama, and many influential overseas Chinese figures arrived at the dock to welcome him. A group of Japanese reporters boarded the ship to present their cards and request a meeting. Song dispatched Secretary Huang Jidao to act as a proxy to meet them. Huang told the reporters, "Minister Song has never met with reporters in New York, Seattle, or other places, and he does not wish to meet with you gentlemen today either. The matter of Minister Song meeting with Shigemitsu Aoi was never discussed on the ship. Minister Song has no plans to disembark while the ship is docked in Yokohama." Song himself refused to meet them, but after negotiations with the reporters, he agreed to have his photograph taken. Song, wearing a light yellow suit and a brown tie, came out of the cabin, had his photograph taken, and then re-entered the cabin. (Japan United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<h3>Joint Japanese-Manchukuo Forces Launch Land and Sea Attack on Righteous Army</h3>
<p>Occupying Hulin Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to official reports here, the joint Japanese-"Manchukuo" forces, after launching a land and sea attack along the Ussuri River, occupied Hulin at 6:30 this morning. Prior to the occupation, "Manchukuo" gunboats sailed to the Lixi (transliteration) and Lizhi (transliteration) areas of the Songhua River and shelled anti-"Manchukuo" troops of three-man squads for as long as ninety minutes. It is claimed that thirty righteous soldiers died in the battle. However, other righteous armies are still maintaining a tight defense near Raohe (transliteration). This morning, before the joint Japanese-"Manchukuo" forces occupied Hulin, a unit of Japanese troops, commanded by Matsuda, five miles from Hulin, attacked the righteous army opposing them, resulting in the death of one hundred people. Due to heavy rain, the roads were impassable, so the main force of the righteous army was able to retreat to the northeast. It is said that the "Manchukuo" gunboat Weimin has already recovered the Manchurian ships Dongshan and Pancheng, which had fallen into the hands of the righteous army. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>

<p>Japan Coaxes the United States</p>
<h3>Tokugawa Lobbies Americans</h3>
<p>San Francisco Prince Tokugawa Iesato, the former president of the Japanese House of Peers, who has been advocating for maintaining peace between Japan and the United States for fifty years, has recently arrived here and declared that his visit to the United States is entirely for personal reasons and does not involve any official business. The five representatives of Japan's participation in the World Cotton Conference in Czech Kyeongseong also arrived here at the same time. Delegation Chairman Okada declared that Japan-US relations and Japan's progress are viewed favorably by the Japanese people. Recently, the San Francisco Chamber of Commerce advocated for implementing a quota system for Japanese immigrants to the United States, rather than a complete ban on immigration, which is quite popular among the Japanese people. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>San Francisco Tokugawa Iesato, the former Speaker of the House of Peers, arrived in San Francisco on the 24th and broadcast a speech to the American people via radio, saying that the Japanese have a deep friendship with the United States, and that President Roosevelt's National Industrial Recovery Act is a thorough policy for overcoming economic difficulties. Japan, both in the government and among the people, is watching its progress with great interest. If President Roosevelt's plan is successful, all countries in the world will be able to restore their economic status and overcome global economic difficulties. Resolving global economic difficulties requires mutual understanding and friendly cooperation among all countries. The trade relationship between Japan and the United States is progressing steadily, and the close integration of the two countries is truly desirable. Japan is the largest buyer of American goods in the Orient, and the United States is also the best customer for Japanese goods. There is also no conflict in the economic interests of the two countries in China. Trade between Japan and the United States is not competitive, but rather mutually beneficial.

<p>French Reporter Observes That Russia and Japan Will Not Declare War</p>
<h3>Russia Selling CER Indicates Peace</h3>
<p>(Paris) Reporter de Bosschère published an article in Le Temps, first discussing the relations among China, Japan, and Russia, and then discussing the Xinjiang Incident. He concluded that "Neither Japan nor the Soviet Union intends to go to war. The Soviet Union's proposal to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway indicates that it has no intention of war. Moreover, the Soviet Union has indicated that it can conclude a commercial treaty with Japan, and Japan seems willing to proceed along the lines proposed by the Soviet Union on both of these matters. Therefore, if there is a danger of conflict in the Far East, it will definitely not occur among China, Japan, and Russia." (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Telegram Claims General Strike Brewing on CER</h3>
<p>(Changchun) According to reliable reports, approximately seven or eight Soviet cadres of the Chinese Eastern Railway boarded a train departing from Harbin on the 23rd, passing through Angxi and returning to the Soviet Union. It seems that the group issued important instructions when passing through Manchuria. It is worth paying attention to such moves, especially with the remnants of cadres of the Northern Railways amid rumors that workers on the Chinese Eastern Railway will go on a general strike. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to news circulating in Japanese newspaper circles, the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency has recently devised a new conspiracy against Russia, which is to use old currency from the Tsarist era to incite the people of the Three Eastern Provinces to resist the Soviet Union. It is said that several Chinese are in close contact with the Service Agency. After 1917, Sino-Japanese speculation on Russian currency was rampant. At that time, many people bought old rubles from the Tsarist era, because Japan and various European and American allies believed that the Russian Revolution would definitely fail, and the old imperial currency would surely see the light of day again. Due to this desire for profit, there were no shortage of speculators who collected old Tsarist currency. According to Japanese investigations, the amount reaches 260 million rubles. Japan wants to use the speculators' desire for profit to advocate in the Eastern Provinces for the purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway with old currency. Knowing that this kind of conspiracy lacks a legal basis, at least they can use the speculators' desire for profit to incite Chinese anti-Russian sentiments, so that the Japanese can arbitrarily use them. It is said that within Liaoning Province, this kind of conspiracy is particularly intense. (China United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>

<p>According to Japanese news, mercury and tungsten deposits have recently been discovered in the suburbs of Qian Gou Town, southern Rehe. Because the amount of these two minerals produced domestically in Japan is extremely small, all parties in Japan attach great importance to this. The discoverers were Torii Kenkichi and Gotō Sadato, two students from Kumamoto Prefecture who were sent to study in Mongolia. They entered Rehe with the army as translators during the current Rehe campaign, learned that there were tungsten mines near Shuangshanzi Mountain in the Great Wall, and inspected it at risk, whereupon they discovered the tungsten mine. Moreover, connected to Shanxi there is a mercury mine. After analysis, it was found to contain 17 percent, which is a high-quality ore. (World Press)</p>

<h3>US Naval Chief Scheduled to Inspect Coastal Defenses</h3>
<p>(Washington) US Naval Chief Swanson has decided to leave Washington on September 7th aboard the new cruiser Indianapolis to inspect naval bases and coastal defenses throughout the country. He will first go to the US naval base at Guantanamo in Cuba, then pass through the Panama Canal to inspect the defenses there, and then go directly to Pearl Harbor in Honolulu. It is said that Swanson is particularly eager to inspect the naval defense facilities on Honolulu in recent years. Afterwards, he will return to the Pacific coast to inspect the three major military ports of Bremerton in Washington State, Vallejo in California, and San Diego. Navy officials claim that this trip is of no particular importance, but because all proposals for new naval construction must be deliberated and approved by Swanson, he wants to inspect the current situation of various naval bases in person in order to make appropriate measures and ensure that there are no oversights.

<p>Osaka Building Large Anti-Aircraft Tower</p>
<h3>Scheduled to be Completed in March of Showa 10 [1935]</h3>
<p>Osaka The Osaka City Electric Bureau's Shijo Electric Science Museum recently petitioned the prefectural construction section for permission to build a large anti-aircraft tower. The tower will occupy 164 tsubo, with one floor underground and thirteen floors above ground, and a height of 53.5 meters (over 176 feet). The basement will be a coffee shop directly managed by the City Electric Bureau. From the first to the fifth floors, there will be an electrical appliance museum concentrating the essence of modern electrical science. The sixth floor will be an ice skating rink, the seventh floor will be a viewing platform, and the eighth to thirteenth floors will be an 82-square-meter tower. Each floor will be equipped with machine guns, and there will be a command and sound amplification device on the tower. If an emergency report of an enemy aircraft attack is received, a bell will be pressed, and the sound amplification devices on the roof of the prefectural office and dozens of other locations throughout the city will simultaneously alert the citizens. Emergency preparedness and lighting control can be realized in an instant. There is also an electrical news display on the wall. This anti-aircraft tower combines the beauty of both a "hall of science for peace" and an "anti-aircraft tower in times of emergency." The tower is scheduled to be completed in March of Showa 10.

<h3>Brazil Orders Warships from Japan</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, Brazil in South America ordered thirty large and small warships from Japanese shipyards, worth over 200 million yuan, as a continuing project for ten years. Japanese private shipyards have never received such a large batch of shipbuilding contracts from overseas. Whether to accept the order is being discussed among industry professionals. Because Brazil is currently experiencing financial difficulties, half of the price will be paid in the country's famous coffee. It is said that if this coffee is disposed of by Mitsui Bussan or Mitsubishi Corporation, there will definitely be some kind of disposal plan within ten years. However, in general, because shipyards are currently busy with military industrial production, if the conditions are not good, they plan not to accept the order. (Den Tsushin dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Japan's Seiyukai Formulates Five Major Policies</p>
<h3>To Be Presented by Suzuki to Saito</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai is scheduled to reconvene tomorrow to formulate national policies to be proposed to Prime Minister Saito. Suzuki will visit Saito at his private residence in Yotsuya on the morning of the 28th, which is Monday, to present the Seiyukai's five major national policies. It is said that the national policies proposed by the Seiyukai are in the nature of hopes and do not intend to force the Prime Minister to implement them within a certain period of time. The contents are as follows: (1) Diplomacy and National Defense: Regarding diplomacy, it is necessary to abide by the imperial rescript issued at the time of withdrawing from the League of Nations, implement independent diplomacy, prevent redization, and prioritize economic diplomacy, especially to restore amicable relations with Russia and China. For national defense, Manchuria and the South Sea Islands should be the first line of defense, and the strength of the army, navy, and air force should be developed based on the Washington Treaty and the London Treaty. (2) Manchuria Issue: Taking the coexistence and co-prosperity of Japan and Manchukuo as a principle, control various industries in Manchuria, revise tariffs, consolidate transportation, open new roads, and promote cotton and various pigments needed by Japan. (3) Industrial Policy: Implementing a five-year industrial plan in principle, advocating immigration, accelerating the implementation of low-interest policies to promote the circulation of industrial finance, increasing agricultural prices, and controlling consumer organizations. (4) Financial Issues: Promoting industry to achieve a natural increase in tax revenue, establishing new official industries, and remedying the deficit in the national treasury. (5) Reforming the Administrative Organization: Taking local decentralization and efficient administration as principles, expanding the powers of autonomous organizations, and merging and reorganizing various provincial and administrative agencies. (China United Press dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai is now studying the policies to be proposed by President Suzuki to Prime Minister Saito. It has now decided to add two more items to the five items of diplomacy, international affairs, Japan-Manchukuo economics, domestic affairs, and industry: a concrete plan to sweep away the misfortunes of the people, and financial and economic countermeasures.

<p>Japan Eagerly Seeks to Establish Economic Aggression Policy</p>
<h3>Uchida Presides Over Trade Council</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has established a Trade Council to deal with the economic alliances of various countries, with the aim of establishing a foreign trade policy. The members have been decided as follows and will be formally appointed next week. The first meeting of the Council will be held in early September, and Foreign Minister Uchida will consult on the establishment of a trade policy plan and begin discussions. The chairman of the Trade Council is Uchida Kosai, and the members are the vice ministers and bureau chiefs of various ministries. The members from the private sector are: Kyōjōnosuke, representative of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce (under negotiation); Inabata Katsutarō, representative of the Osaka Chamber of Commerce; Fukai Eigo, representative of the Bank of Japan; and Kodama Kenji of the Yokohama Specie Bank. The secretary-general and secretaries are as follows: Secretary-General Kurisu Saburō, Secretaries Inoue Kōjirō, etc. (four people). (Den Tsushin dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the recent Shimla conference, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs believes that because British India adopted an oppressive attitude towards Japanese trade, there cannot be much hope. However, the reason why the situation has reached this point is that there was no prepared countermeasure policy, and the tariff policy was too defenseless. In order to prepare for a more intensified international trade war in the future, it is necessary to seek the fundamental establishment of a trade policy. Therefore, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to establish the Trade Council, a trade advisory body, and has selected approximately 40 committee members from both government and private sectors. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will formally appoint them in the middle of next week, and the first meeting will be held in early September. The consultation items are as follows: (1) Change from the traditional major market principle to a small market principle, and open up new markets. (2) Strive to secure the old major markets of the United States, India, and China from the standpoint of reciprocity. (3) The fundamental principle of the traditional commercial treaty, which is unconditional most-favored-nation treatment, is now changed to a principle of reciprocity. Countries that unilaterally contend for trade should take retaliatory measures. (4) In order to sweep away the name of false exchange rate dumping and prevent the harm of suppressing Japanese goods, establish a fundamental policy of export control for all exports. (5) Re-examine the major supply areas of cotton, wool, and oil. Because the result of focusing on one market in the past is that Japan has been illegally oppressed by India raising tariffs this time, it is decided to start researching new supply areas to adapt to the trade balance policy.

<p>London Wheat Conference Establishes Provisional Agreement</p>
<h3>Wheat-Producing Countries Limit Export Quotas; Importing Countries Agree to Revise Tariffs</h3>
<p>(London) The important provisional wheat agreement will be signed at 5:10 PM today and will be registered with the League of Nations. The agreement stipulates: (1) Exporting countries agree to limit the total amount exported in 1933-34 to 560 million bushels. (2) Except for Russia and the Danube countries, exporting countries will reduce production by 15 percent in 1934-35. (3) Importing countries agree to revise tariffs when the price of wheat reaches 12 Swiss gold francs per 100 kilograms, or 63.6 gold cents per bushel (referring to delivery at the destination port), and at the same time agree not to take advantage of the opportunity of exporting countries reducing their quotas to develop domestic production. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Exporting countries established a wheat agreement today and have accepted the price of 12 gold francs per 100 kilograms. (Reuters dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The general public originally thought that the general assembly of the Wheat Conference would discuss the unification of wheat prices as the basis for international trade in order to reduce tariffs. Unexpectedly, today's general assembly did not involve this matter. Only representatives of several importing countries made reservations regarding the draft agreement proposed by the various exporting countries. At the afternoon meeting, the general interpretation of the agreement and its implementation in various countries were discussed. Approximately an annex will be added to the text of the agreement, stipulating the method of implementation.</p>
<p>The general reservation clauses will be included, and the conference decided that France, Germany, and the United Kingdom will be listed as both wheat-producing countries and wheat-importing countries. Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, the Netherlands, Czechoslovakia, and Ireland belong to livestock-raising countries and are intermediate groups. Spain represents other European countries. If any of the designated countries do not wish to sign the agreement, the technical committee will redesignate them. (Havas dispatch, 24th)</p>
<p>The Nation Must Seek Self-Strengthening</p>
<h3>Mussolini's Warning</h3>
<p>On the Way to Inspect Army Maneuvers</p>
<p>Mussolini Narrowly Escapes Disaster</p>
<p>Italy's Coni Army maneuvers yesterday have been temporarily halted, Premier Mussolini has given a speech during his visit to Coni. The speech states: a nation that desires freedom and peace must seek self-strengthening. Self-strengthening must require increasing the birth rate. In the event of a child shortage and an empty cradle, a nation will suffer decline. Self-strengthening must include the will to have courage, making a firm decision without hesitation. Self-strengthening needs a strong and resilient personality. A nation experiencing a boom must be aware of its status, and if they face a disaster or an unfair strike, they must remain calm and cool. The Italian government and people desire peace and can show that with proof. No one can deny that. (Havas dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>Gromonte, Italy Italian Prime Minister Mussolini nearly escaped a disaster today while inspecting army maneuvers, as the prime minister's car met a truck carrying troops on a narrow mountain road. As Mussolini's car dodged the truck, the front wheels went over the edge of the mountain road and was suspended in the air. The Prime Minister jumped out of the car, escaping unscathed. The car was eventually dragged back onto the road. (Reuters dispatch, 24th)</p>
<h3>Italian Cabinet to Be Reorganized</h3>

It is said that the current ambassador to London, Grandi, will be recalled to Italy to serve as foreign minister. Furthermore, Mussolini is reportedly planning to establish a Ministry of National Defense, consisting of three departments: Army, Navy, and Air Force. Mussolini is expected to concurrently hold the position of Minister of National Defense, while the current Air Minister, General Balbo, will be appointed as the Chief of Staff of the Army, Navy, and Air Force Headquarters. Additionally, the current ambassador to the Holy See, Duke Fanzhi, will relinquish his position to become the Speaker of the Senate. Moreover, there will be significant changes to the deputy ministers of various departments. (25th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>British Representatives Depart for Simla Conference</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th – The British delegation representing the cotton and rayon industries, heading to India to participate in the British-Indian-Japanese commercial conference, departed from London this morning. The chief representative, Sir Lees, did not travel with the group but will meet them in Marseille. Sir Lees told a Reuters reporter that the purpose of the delegation’s mission is to bring back plans and proposals that will enable Lancashire to secure more satisfactory trade relations in its export trade with India and in other markets of interest to both British and Indian manufacturers. A permanent resolution to the problem of Japanese competition in India is clearly the greatest necessity for British and Indian manufacturers. If cooperation and mutual understanding can be established in Indo-British trade relations on this basis, the British delegation's trip will not be in vain.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 25th – The Times commented today on the triangular cotton industry conference to be held in India among Britain, India, and Japan, saying that recent competition has become increasingly fierce, creating a very complex situation. The British delegation will begin its novel attempt in the realm of commercial diplomacy tomorrow and will have the opportunity to dispel Japanese suspicions of British animosity towards Japan through frank discussions. The British representatives will certainly be able to demonstrate Britain's sincere desire to eliminate all obstacles hindering the longstanding friendship between Britain and Japan. The success of the British representatives will also be significant if they can dispel the doubts harbored by Indian manufacturers that Lancashire cotton mills seek to impede the development of the Indian cotton industry. The difficulties the cotton industry conference will encounter should not be overlooked, but although the possibility of failure is high, the opportunity to prove the effectiveness of the method of introducing commercial agreements through negotiation should not be denied. If the industries concerned can establish an agreement, it is better than using the difficulties of international trade to adjust diplomatic manipulation. Can the British delegation move Indian and Japanese manufacturers with their solid ability to handle matters and their sincere willingness to cooperate? The future success depends on this, and it is no small matter. If the atmosphere is right and goodwill prevails, perhaps a path can be found to eliminate instability in the Far Eastern market.</p>
<h3>Extremely Severe Windstorm on the US East Coast</h3>
<p>Number of Victims Continues to Increase</p>
<p>Material Losses Exceed Twenty Million</p>
<p>Waves Rise and Homes are Destroyed</p>
<p>Boats are Lost and Crops are Ruined</p>
<p>(New York) The current death toll from the storm on the US East Coast has reached 24, with many injured. There is a risk of breach in the 2 million-ton reservoir dam in Upper Spring Grove, New Jersey. If it breaches, the disaster will be even more severe. In Ocean City, New Jersey, waves are shaking the seaside hotels, and guests are fleeing in panic. However, their cars cannot travel far, often getting stuck in the sea sand. Hundreds of people in Pennsylvania are taking refuge in churches due to their homes being damaged. The lights on the Statue of Liberty in New York and the famous Sandy Hook Lighthouse have been extinguished by the wind, demonstrating its immense force. Many houses in New York have had their roofs blown off, and small boats scattered throughout the harbor are hindering navigation. In Fort Monroe, Virginia, a hospital filled with refugees has been flooded by waves.</p>
<p>(New York) The number of victims of the windstorm continues to rise, and requests for assistance are pouring in from all directions. Several towns in Maryland are urgently seeking help from the Coast Guard. In one location, over a hundred households are cut off from all transportation and are in great danger. This storm has deviated from its usual path, extending to the coast of North Carolina. Virginia has suffered the most severe damage. Seaside summer resorts and luxurious residences and homes have all been destroyed by the hammer-like waves. Hundreds of miles of waterfront and roads are flooded. The losses will naturally reach millions of dollars, but the exact figure cannot yet be estimated. Several large ships and many small boats are missing, and their fate is unknown.</p>
<p>(New York) The number of victims of the storm continues to rise, reaching a total of 42, including eight in New Jersey. It is reported that many crops in the areas affected by the storm have also been destroyed. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Four states on the US Atlantic coast are affected by the storm and are engaged in relief efforts. The total death toll is 32. The losses to public and private buildings are no less than $25 million. Norfolk, Virginia, was swept by winds of 80 miles per hour, causing the most severe damage, no less than $5 million, and killing 10 people. The damage in Virginia Beach and Ocean View is similar, but due to the smaller size of the towns, the losses are each within $2 million. The hurricane made landfall on the coast of North Carolina, traveled north towards Maine, with the most severe damage in Virginia, Maryland, and Delaware. Washington and its vicinity are also within the hurricane's path. It has already reached Maine tonight, and the wind force has weakened, so although there has been damage north of Delaware, the disaster is not as severe. Today, as the remaining winds were still blowing through Maryland, a Pennsylvania train was crossing a small bridge near Washington when the bridge was submerged by rushing water and its foundations loosened. The front part of the train overturned into the river, killing two and injuring 22. However, the most severe losses are to livestock and crops in the lowlands. The Department of Agriculture has dispatched personnel to investigate the rural areas to determine the need for emergency relief. The Red Cross is already engaged in relief efforts, but most of the damage in the towns is to the residences of wealthy people. A second storm is following the same path as the first, but the wind force is not strong enough to cause a disaster. Naval personnel worked with the Weather Bureau overnight to survey the disaster situation. This morning, it was reported that the southern cities no longer require the Marines to maintain order, and the police are in control of the situation.</p>

<p>Hurricane Strikes Austria</p>
<h3>Trees Uprooted and Houses Destroyed with Great Ferocity</h3>
<p>Vienna – Today, Austria was suddenly hit by a rainstorm which intensified into a hurricane by midnight. The chimneys of factories and the roofs of houses were broken or blown away in large numbers. The number of residential glass windows destroyed was countless. Trees were uprooted everywhere by the strong winds. Many people and livestock were injured by electrocution or by falling objects. There is no definite investigation yet. In the Lienz area, a train was stopped by the wind and rain and could not proceed. The roof of one carriage was blown away by the wind. (24th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>US Federal Reserve Expands Lending to Aid Industrial Recovery</h3>
<p>Reuters, New York, 24th – The Federal Reserve Board released its weekly report this afternoon, stating that the US government's securities holdings had increased by $35 million, which was unexpected by Wall Street. In the past week, newspapers have repeatedly reported that the Federal Reserve Board would expand its lending, but before the Fed's report today, the only clear evidence was the reduction in the bank discount rate. The Federal Reserve Board has the authority to purchase $3 billion in government bonds, but it has only been purchasing $10 million per week. General Johnson's recent statement that the government will issue a lending mobilization order to aid the execution of the National Industrial Recovery Act's movement to expand employment, raise wages, is viewed as a form of moderate inflation. Some quarters even regard this as an indication that the Federal Reserve Board may make large-scale purchases of government bonds in the open market. The Evening Post stated tonight that, according to reliable sources, the full authority of the Federal Reserve Board is now used to support the industrial recovery program. The twelve Federal Reserve Banks have begun to purchase US government bonds. This move will increase the lending power of the banks under the Federal Reserve by $30 million to $35 million per week. As for how long the increased purchase of government bonds will continue, there is no indication, but it will probably have to wait until the degree of lending expansion desired by the Industrial Recovery Administration has been reached. Large-scale purchases of government bonds are certainly not a new record, as the Federal Reserve Board took this action in the open market a year ago, taking in $100 million per week, but its plan to revitalize commerce ultimately failed.</p>
<p>Sun Liangcheng Announces Retirement</p>
<h3>Troops Reassigned to Chahar Provincial Government</h3>
<p>Zhangjiakou – Sun Liangcheng announced in a telegram: "Since the founding of the Republic of China over twenty years ago, war has been continuous with no peaceful days, leading to the impoverishment of the people and the shaking of the national foundation. Japanese invaders are pursuing their ambitions, taking the opportunity to invade. Since the September 18th Incident, the four northeastern provinces have successively fallen, and they are now further encroaching on Chahar Province, threatening Beijing and Tianjin. At that time, the overall situation in North China was already precarious. Now that Mr. Feng has left Chahar, and Chairman Song Mingxuan has returned to the provincial capital, someone is in charge of military and state affairs. Liangcheng will immediately retire to his hometown, and his troops will be reassigned to the provincial government. From now on, in the capacity of a common citizen, I will do my best to fulfill my national duty. I hope that the whole nation will work together with one heart and mind, cross the river in the same boat, and lay the foundation for the nation's prosperity for ten thousand years. In the future, anyone who falsely uses my name for personal gain will not be held responsible. I respectfully express my sincere intentions for your consideration."

<p>Havas, Havana, 25th - Although the new president, Dr. Cespedes, wanted to pass the constitutional reform bill through Congress first, according to the original plan drafted by US Ambassador Welles, before proceeding sequentially, he was forced by the unanimous will of the revolutionaries to order the dissolution of Congress and cooperate with the parties participating in the revolution to establish a de facto government.

<h3>Inspection Report on the Yellow River Breach at Lanfeng and Kaocheng</h3>
<p>The Xiaoxinkou Breach is Approximately Half a Li Wide</p>
<p>The Water Level After the Drop Still Exceeds Ten Feet</p>
<p>Disaster Victims Line the Roads, Their Situation Extremely Tragic</p>
<p>Yellow Water Floods Kaocheng Through All Four Gates</p>
<p>Correspondences from Kaifeng: The Yellow River breach at Lanfeng and Kaocheng has caused immense flooding, affecting several southeastern provinces, and alarming reports are pouring in, causing nationwide shock. To understand the true situation, our reporter traveled to Lanfeng and Kaocheng on the 21st to inspect the Yellow River breach. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(The Situation at the Lanfeng Breach) At 12:00 noon on the 21st, I traveled east by car with Mr. Wang Ziying, a reporter from the Republic Daily. We arrived at Lanfeng and passed through the city, noting that the streets were narrow and extremely dilapidated. Exiting the north gate, after about half a li, we reached the ferry crossing on the old course of the Yellow River. We saw four or five sailboats ferrying people across, charging one string of cash per passenger before setting off. This was because the water had risen sharply again the previous night, reaching a depth of about eight or nine feet and a width of several li, making the ferry crossing unusually laborious. In the middle of the river, we saw weeds and other debris hanging on the power lines, remnants of the initial surge of water, indicating that the water depth at that time was at least twelve feet. After reaching the north bank, we hired donkeys and headed northwest. The land was covered with peanut crops, interspersed with grains, beans, sorghum, corn, and sweet potatoes. We crossed dikes and traversed sand dunes, but saw no other vegetation. No wonder Lanfeng, which spans hundreds of li, only has a land tax revenue of six thousand taels. Passing through Qian Lu Tun and Hou Lu Tun, and crossing the dike opening, we saw a difference in elevation of about ten feet. This is because the current southeastward flow follows the river course before the Tongwaxiang breach in the fifth year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty. This section is even older, referred to by the locals as the old Yellow River channel. Arriving at Nanbei Zhuang, more than eighteen li from the county seat, and passing the Erba Zhai dike west of the village, we looked west and saw water meeting the sky. Continuing northwest for less than a li, we reached the so-called new dike, about nine feet high and more than fifty feet wide. Turning south for half a li, the breach came into view. This is the Xiaoxinkou breach in Cailou Township, Lanfeng, which has caused a nationwide uproar. The breach is about half a li wide, northeast of Cailou, directly north of Zhenpu Village, and southeast of Nanbei Zhuang. The depth still exceeds ten feet. The water flows southeastward along the old course, naturally inundating Shandong and Jiangsu provinces. It is estimated that the breach occurred at 2:00 AM on the 11th, and it has been more than ten days. Currently, apart from a dozen farmers salvaging firewood in the shallow water, no government officials have been seen intervening. According to nearby residents, apart from the complete destruction of farmland within the old course and the washing away of crops, livestock, and people, there has been no other damage within Lanfeng. However, villages such as Zhang Zhuang, Shanren Zhuang, Xinzhuang Hu, Ding Ge Deng, Xue An, Jiahe Tan, Liang Ge Deng, Yang Ge Deng, Lao Wen, Xi Lao Wen, Xiao Wang Zhuang, and the villages under the jurisdiction of Chenliu County have all suffered house collapses and livestock deaths, because they are located in the滩地 (滩地, alluvial land or floodplain), and the river water overflowed, unrelated to the breach, so they say.</p>
<p>(Villages Turned into Swamps) Afterwards, we continued northeast, passing through Wei Zhuang, Zhu Chang, and Xiao Han Zhuang for about fifteen li, arriving at Zhaoying, a town more prosperous than the county seat, as the sun was setting. We stayed overnight. The next morning at 7:00 AM, we rode donkeys from Zhaoying towards the Daji District, about six li to the northwest. About one li from the village, the main road was extremely muddy, and the crops on both sides were also flooded. Unable to proceed, we had to go ashore and follow a small path to "Bu Kou" (i.e., the dike opening, referred to by locals as Bu Kou). We saw several houses that had been flooded and the project to block the water with red sorghum stalks placed in the opening, all still visible. However, it was only about three feet high, six or seven feet lower than the dike. If the water had continued to rise, the villages on the dike would not have been spared, and the Zhaoying area would certainly have become a swamp. We climbed the dike and looked northwest, northeast, and directly north, seeing a vast expanse of yellow water with no end in sight. Only the treetops could still be glimpsed. We could still hear the rushing sound of the water. This was the former location of Zi Fang, Jun Li Zhai, Jie Zhuang, Lei Zhai, Qing De, Wang Li Ji, Han Zhuang, Nan Chen Zhuang, Geng Xin Zhuang, Wang Duan Gong Zhuang, Bei Chen Zhuang, Ma Ti, Xiao Han Zhuang, Huo Yan, Qian Jin Zhuang, Hou Jin Miao, Cai Ji, Bei Zhang Zhuang, Yue Zhai, Yao Zhai, Li Qi Zhuang, Ma Zhai, Wen Ji, Gao Zhai, Dai Zhai, Bei Cheng Zhuang, Jian Zhuang, Pan Zhai, and other villages. The ground was eight feet higher than before, and all the fields and houses were gone. The disaster victims who had escaped or had not escaped, even if they had not starved to death, had nowhere to find food after the flood, and sooner or later would inevitably become starving corpses. Currently, the disaster victims and farmers are digging red sorghum ears out of the charcoal and mud to eat. The water here came from Ma Ti, and the breach occurred on July 31st. That day was the thirty-seventh birthday of Zhao Yihe, the magistrate of Lanfeng County. While drums and gongs were playing and a opera was being performed, he received the report, but the magistrate had no time to deal with it. Therefore, the news of the breach was not published in the Kaifeng newspapers. The situation was likely similar to the previous reports of water overflowing from the dike at Cailou.</p>
<p>(Yellow Water Flows Directly to Kaocheng) Traveling east through Xiao Zhang Ji, we saw that what was being dried in the street were the grains and charcoal dug out. After nine li, we arrived at Yuan Zhai and went north along the dike for several hundred feet, which was the breach directly flooding Kaocheng. It was about half a li wide, and the water depth was still about forty feet. This place was the site of a breach in the late Qing Dynasty. At that time, due to the whirlpools forming a pool, it was impossible to close the breach, so it had to be bypassed in a half-moon shape to the west before being built. Locals call it "Quan." After the Ma Ti breach, the water had already flowed to this place, but it was not very large. On the 11th, the river water rose further, and the flow became stronger. Zhang Yuzhi, the magistrate of Kaocheng County, who was from Jiangxi, went to inspect after receiving the report, thinking that the water was not as large as the "ducks being released" in the south, and told the people not to panic. On the 12th, he opened the Quan dike, sending water directly to Kaocheng. Because the magistrate underestimated the water and the defenses were inadequate, the water flooded into the city through all four gates. We traveled northeast along the dike, passing Simingtang Zhai and Zhao Zhai for about nine li, reaching the southwest corner of Kaocheng. The dike was full of cone-shaped grass huts, where disaster victims lived with their families, in a very miserable state. The water level in Kaocheng was still more than three feet deep, and boats were needed to enter the city. One hundred percent of the houses in the city were collapsed. Except for the main hall of the Wenmiao Temple and the stage of the Chenghuang Temple, none were intact. The stench was unbearable, so at 11:00 AM, we mounted our donkeys, whipped them on, and followed the road for eighteen li to Zhaoying. After a short rest, we went southwest for thirty-five li and returned to the ferry crossing we had used yesterday. We saw that the water had dropped about two feet compared to yesterday, exposing a lot of dry beach. We crossed the river to the station, fortunately not missing the 3:30 PM train west, and returned to Bian. (Written on August 22nd)</p>
<h3>Liu Wenhui Leads His Remnants to Xikang</h3>
<p>Liu Deng's Forces Repeatedly Occupy Key Passes such as Qiongzhou and Ya'an</p>
<p>Liu Wenhui's Adopted Son, Shi Zhaowu, Executed by Gunfire by Liu Xiang</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: Since Liu Xiang's army crossed the Min River and captured Jiading, Liu Wenhui's troops have lost their ability to fight. Therefore, Liu Xiang has set a deadline of one week to completely resolve Liu Wenhui's forces and decided to unify the situation in Sichuan in August. As a result, the war in southern Sichuan has intensified in recent days. On the 17th, Li Qixiang of the New Sixth Division, Deng Xihou of the Twenty-eighth Army, and Li Jianming, Chief of Staff of the Twenty-first Army, jointly attacked Qiongzhou. Ao's brigade of Li's forces, familiar with the terrain, infiltrated the city. The Twenty-fourth Army, guarding the city, mistakenly believed them to be anti-tax troops and did not pay much attention. Liu Xiang's army launched a surprise attack. Chen Hongwen, commander of the Second Division of the Sichuan-Kang Army under Liu Wenhui, and Shi Zhaowu (Liu Wenhui's adopted son), commander of the Second Police Brigade, were captured alive. Liu Wenhui himself, however, led Li Yushu and Liu Yuantang's brigades, as well as the pistol team, and Shi Zhaowu's remnants, fleeing in panic towards Mingshan. Another part of Liu Xiang's army, Rao Guohua and Guo Xun's brigades of the Twenty-first Army, approached Hongya on the 19th, cutting off the floating bridge at Zhige, where Liu Wenhui's army was stationed. Liu Wenhui's army collapsed in a hurry. The total number of soldiers who drowned while crossing the river and died in battle reached more than 10,000. Rao and Guo's troops seized thousands of guns. Peng Youcheng of Liu Wenhui's army was incorporated into Liu Xiang's army in Chongqing, and Liu appointed Peng as the commander of the Second Provisional Division of the Sichuan Army. On the 21st, Hongya, Jiajiang, and Emei counties were successively captured by various units of Liu Xiang's army. Liu Xiang, Deng Xihou, and others then jointly attacked Ya'an. Knowing that he could not resist, Liu Wenhui withdrew from Ya'an city in advance, leading more than 30,000 troops to defend Rongjing, ordering his troops to defend Ya'an to the death. As a result, Ya'an was captured by Liu Xiang's army on the morning of the 22nd. Liu Wenhui then deployed heavy troops in Rongjing to try to recover the remnants of the front line, using Daguan as the first line of defense and Xiaoguan as the second line of defense. Liu Xiang's army also advanced westward in three routes: (1) Directly attacking Daguan and Xiaoguan from the front; (2) The right wing advanced from Niba Mountain and Jiubasuo towards Luding Bridge; (3) The left wing advanced from Shaitai Ping towards Fulou. On the 23rd, all three routes were launched. Liu Wenhui's army could not hold on and showed signs of collapse. At that time, the brigades of Wang Yuanni, Li Yushu, Lin Meipo, Zhang Zhifang, and Yu Zhongying successively defected and surrendered to Liu Xiang. Knowing that the situation was hopeless, Liu Wenhui telegraphed all parties on the 23rd, expressing his willingness to lead his troops into Xikang. The original telegram stated: "Wenhui has today selectively left troops to rush to Xikang to devote themselves to national defense. All troops left in Sichuan, those in the Ya'an, Mingshan, and Lushan areas, are temporarily commanded by Deputy Commander Xiang Yuren; those in Hongya and Jiajiang are temporarily commanded by Commanders Leng Xunnan and Xia Zhongshi. This is respectfully reported."</p>
<p>Liu Xiang believed that Liu Wenhui was about to be eliminated and that the war in southern Sichuan would end in the short term. Therefore, he expanded the organization of the Sichuan Post-War Supervisory Office in Chengdu for military, civil, financial, educational, construction, and group affairs, dividing it into military affairs, political affairs, construction, group affairs, and education departments to unify all administrations in Sichuan. Liu Xiang also ordered the frontline troops to transfer Shi Zhaowu, the brigade commander of Liu Wenhui's army who had been captured, to the provincial capital for interrogation and punishment. Liu Xiang executed Shi by gunfire on the 21st. (August 24th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu Requests Appropriation of American Wheat Loan for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>Sun Tonggang and He Siyuan Fly to Western Shandong for Inspection</p>
<p>Fan County Submerged, Occupying Three-Fifths of the Entire County</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The upstream water situation seems to be slightly stable, but the disaster area is vast and in urgent need of rescue. Governor Han Fuqu had previously telegraphed the central government to allocate the surplus funds for flood control of the Yangtze River to help the disaster-stricken people. However, this was still a drop in the bucket and could not be universally applied. On the 22nd, he again telegraphed Chairman Chiang and Premier Wang, requesting the allocation of 2 million yuan from the American wheat sale to provide assistance. The original telegram stated: "Respectfully to Chairman Chiang at Guling and Premier Wang of the Nanjing Executive Yuan: According to the telegram from An Maolong, the magistrate of Dong'a County, today the Yellow River water suddenly rose, overflowing the banks of the Guanlangxi River, completely submerging the crops and collapsing many houses, and the flood has now reached the city gates. The Yellow River breach has turned more than ten counties in western Shandong into a vast swamp, and the flooding continues eastward, expanding the disaster area daily. Dong'cheng County also reported flooding, with mournful cries everywhere, and no clothes or quilts available. Although we have received your order to allocate the surplus funds for flood control of the Yangtze River, they have not yet been allocated, and our own efforts to raise funds are also a drop in the bucket due to the severity of the disaster. Your Excellencies are deeply concerned about the suffering of the people. We implore you to consider the starvation and drowning of millions of lives and order the allocation of 2 million yuan from the American wheat sale to rescue the flood victims and save their lives. We await your urgent orders. Respectfully, Han Fuqu."</p>
<p>Since the upstream water flooded western Shandong, the counties have been reporting the water situation daily, but mostly briefly and without detail. In order to know the details of the disaster, Han Fuqu sent He Siyuan, a member of the provincial government and director of the education department, and the aviator Sun Tonggang to fly to the disaster area for detailed inspection. Sun and He departed from Zhang Zhuang airfield at 9:00 AM on the 23rd. Upon reaching Shou Zhang, they saw a large flood. The counties of Fan, Pu, and others within the Hetao west of Shou Zhang Gate were a vast expanse of water. All villages and fields were submerged, with only the treetops visible above the water. Flying over the south bank of the Yellow River, Juancheng and Heze were also in the middle of the water. Juye City was surrounded by water, with only the southern part not flooded. The water was several miles away from the city, but it had already approached the city. The southern part of Yuncheng was also flooded. The plane flew low over Juye and Heze, circling for several weeks, and the people on the city walls looked up and jumped to welcome them. Dingtao also had river water. Sun and He carried many small leaflets on the plane. Every time they passed a county, they dropped the leaflets. It is estimated that there are more than 5,000 villages in the disaster area in western Shandong. Assuming 400 people per village, there are now 2 million people who are immersed in water every day, waiting for rescue. (Heze County alone has 400,000 people in the water.) After the inspection, they flew back to Jinan at 1:00 PM and reported to Han. Today (24th) at 2:00 PM, He and Sun took off from Jinan again to inspect Caoxian, Shanxian, Dingtao, and Chengwu on the south bank. Unexpectedly, the weather changed suddenly in the middle of the journey, and a storm of wind and heavy rain struck. The plane was forced to fly low by the wind and rain, so it turned back to the north bank and flew back to Jinan at 5:00 PM. After getting out of the car, Sun entered the city and reported to Han. According to him, they took off from Jinan today and continued southwest along the Yellow River, intending to continue inspecting the disaster area on the south bank. Unexpectedly, between Dong'a and Pingyin, a strong wind and rain struck, and the plane was forced to fly low by the wind and rain, so they turned back along the north bank. In the middle reaches, there were many places where the water overflowed within the large dike and outside the civilian dikes. Dozens of villages were submerged in the water. In the area more than ten miles west of Luokou, the river water also overflowed, and some villagers were using sacks to reinforce the village outside to prevent the water from seeping in.</p>
<p>The Heze-Cao Prefecture Eight County River Works Association telegraphed the provincial government, urging the speedy allocation of funds for disaster relief. The telegram stated: "The association's commissioner has inspected 32 overflow points at Shitou Zhuang in Changyuan County, Hebei, and the two breaches at Yi Ba Zhai and Yuan Zhai on the south bank have submerged 60-70% of the area. The counties in western Shandong are in the direct path of the flood, with water depths of three to four zhang, and the houses of one or two tenths of the population have collapsed, and people and livestock have been washed away, which is extremely tragic. The Hebei River Affairs Bureau is short of funds and materials, and it will not be possible to close the breaches in a short time due to this extraordinary disaster and huge project. If the water flow continues, the wheat cannot be planted, and the future of the local area will be unimaginable. In addition to telegraphed to the chairman, we implore that appropriations be made immediately to take advantage of the situation to seize the choke outside of providing salvation for the hungry, and in the wait for orders. Respectfully, the Heze-Cao Prefecture Eight County River Works Promotion Association."</p>
<p>The Western Shandong Counties Flood Disaster Relief Association sent a letter to the Disaster Relief Association, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, and the Red Swastika Society, calling for relief. The original text is as follows: "Greetings, we have found that this year's Yellow River breach in Hebei and Henan has flooded the counties in western Shandong. Wherever the flood flows, the houses and tombs are gone, the grain is washed away, the livestock are drowned, not a single piece of clothing is left, and all the houses have collapsed. The old and weak have died in the raging waves, and the young and strong are gasping for breath on the treetops and city walls, exposed to the wind and eating and drinking in the wind, and several counties have become swamps, and millions of people are all disaster victims. This is truly an unprecedented catastrophe, a rare disaster. The local officials in western Shandong are rushing to repair the breaches, and Chairman Han has repeatedly telegraphed the central government to request urgent relief, and has reallocated provincial funds, carrying them to the relief season. Those who have lived in western Shandong for generations are concerned about their homeland, and when they see this tragic situation, they have no tears to shed. Therefore, they have gathered together to organize the Western Shandong Yellow River Flood Relief Association, so that they can jointly plan for relief and get on the mattress as soon as possible. However, because this matter is a big deal, it is not enough to make progress and achieve practical results without the support of the group. We have always admired your association for being concerned about the suffering of the people, and for being concerned about the hunger and drowning of the people. This is a good deed to rescue the victims, and should be among the sponsors. We respectfully ask for your support and assistance in everything. We are deeply grateful. This is addressed to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, the Red Swastika Society, and the Shandong Provincial Disaster Relief Association."</p>
<p>Lu Wenhui, the fifth section chief of Fan County, sent a telegram to Wang Ziyu, the secretary-director of the education department, reporting the water situation. The telegram stated: "Respectfully to Secretary Wang, the water level of the Yellow River in Fan County is more than three zhang deep on the Qiao day, falling two gongfen on the Hao day, falling seven gongfen on the Hao day, and falling six gongfen on the Ma day. It is estimated that more than 3,000 qing have been submerged, accounting for more than three-fifths of the land in the entire county. Respectfully, Lu Wenhui, the fifth section chief of Fan County."</p>
<p>The North Shandong Canal has been rising repeatedly, and the dangerous projects are also very critical. Fortunately, the Construction Department sent personnel to cooperate with the county government to repair it, and it has been reported that there is no danger. According to a telephone report from Li Shude, the magistrate of De County, the Construction Department recently reported that the water depth of the canal was one zhang, three chi, and nine cun on the 21st, and it rose another seven cun on the 22nd. The water was turbulent, and the situation was very tight. According to a telegram from Zhen Guangxuan, the magistrate of Wucheng County, from the 20th to the 21st, it rose another three gongcun and five fen, and the water level was two nine three eight eight. A dangerous project occurred at Xudong Dongzhuanghou, and a new dike is being built on the south side to provide protection. (24th)</p>

<h3>Fifth District Repeatedly Experiences Kidnappings</h3>
<p>At about 11 o'clock in the morning, two bandit boats arrived at Xinkaijing Village, Beigang Township, Fifth District of the county. There were more than ten bandits on board, each holding long and short firearms. After landing, they broke into the home of Xu Wenming and tied up Xu's son, A Da. Then, they went to the home of Cai Wenzhou and tied up Cai and Xu, pulling them towards the boat, and firing their guns as a show of force. When the local security force learned of this, they immediately gathered to capture the bandits. The bandits also opened fire to resist. Soon, the bandits were outnumbered and fled towards the Xiangshan River.</p>

<h3>The Dispute over the Putang Pond in the First District is Resolved</h3>
<p>The Putang Pond in Longyu Township, First District Office, which has almost 100mu, was donated by people in the past for charitable use. It has been collected for by all the former officials. However, the other year, one Lu Qing’an coveted the property and planned to pay the Shatian Bureau to purchase and contract, and reported to the county for payment. After repeated presentations to the county by the former industry municipal authorities to stop the performance of rent collection, Lu Qing’an obtained a license from the Department of Finance, he was unable to collect rent. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit with the County Court, pointing out that although the rent of the Putang was collected by the First District Office, there was no formula and no food string, and the property rights were insufficient to prove. The First District Office presented the rent collection book as evidence, and it was reported to the county for filing in the previous Qing Dynasty, how could it be taken away? The court's first-instance judgment ruled that the Putang was owned by the First District Office, and the ownership belonged to the original ownership. Lu Qing’an was sentenced to lose the lawsuit, and Lu refused to appeal to the High Court, which was also rejected. He appealed to the Supreme Court of the Third Instance and was still rejected. Now the First District Office has obtained the judgment of the Supreme Court, and the Putang dispute has come to an end.</p>
<h3>Young Woman Drowns While Fishing, Three Lives Lost</h3>
<p>Zhang Adi, a farmer from Zhangjia Zhuang, Xinzhuang, is twenty-one years old. He married his wife in March of last spring, and the couple lived in harmony. Yesterday morning at about seven o'clock, Zhang's mother went to the town to shop, and Zhang's wife went to the nearby river to fetch water. She happened to see a fish, and Zhang's wife squatted down to catch it. Inadvertently, she fell into the river. Zhang heard the sound and went out to see, and was shocked. He immediately jumped into the water, intending to save her. However, Zhang was not familiar with the water, and the couple floated and sank together. After a while, they both sank. Zhang's mother returned home and saw that her son and daughter-in-law were not there. She went out to look for them and saw shoes by the river. She knew they belonged to her son. She immediately called out to her neighbors to help with the rescue. It took a long time to find the bodies. It was not until the afternoon that they floated up. At that time, Zhang was still holding his wife tightly. Zhang's mother was very sad when she saw this, and she also wanted to throw herself into the river, but fortunately she was stopped by the villagers. Zhang's wife was pregnant and was due to give birth next month, so the baby in her womb also died tragically. Everyone who heard about it was saddened.</p>

<h3>Three Bandit Leaders Executed by Firing Squad</h3>
<p>The Anti-Bandit Command on the Su-Song Waterway, previously, Xu Pucheng, the district chief of the First District of the Shanghai Public Security Bureau of Jiangsu Province, personally supervised the police and captured Gao Guiyou, the Jiangbei bandit leader of Taibao Ashu's gang, Zhang Yaofei, the famous bandit from the Pudong gang, and Chen Yousheng (i.e., Xue Xiaoming's son), and others. He submitted them to the Department. The Commander Shen, together with the military judge, interrogated the case. Gao Guiyou confessed that he was forty-one years old, from Yancheng, Jiangbei. He had been a bandit since 1928. The first time, he teamed up with Zhang Long and others to kidnap a Wang surnamed ticket in Dayuan Township, Nanhui County. In February 1930, he and Jiangbei Dakuai and others went to Chenjiagang, Zhejiang, to abduct a Chen surnamed man and a woman. In December of the same year, he gathered Jiangbei A Si, Xue Xiaomingzi, Zhang Yaofei, and others at the Fang Yao place of the Fang family in Qingpu County, abducted the grandparents, extorted huge sums of money, used them for differentiation, and robbed and murdered Wang Yushan, the deputy director of the traffic office of the 19th Route Army, and others without讳 (讳, the avoidance of using someone's name out of respect or reverence). Zhang Yaofei confessed that he was forty-one years old, from Fengxian County. In the winter of 1930, he listened to the invitations from Lao Yu of the Anhui gang and Gao Guiyou of the Jiangbei gang to join the gang. He successively robbed the Sun family in Wengbanqiao, Zhejiang, and the Fang family in Fangyao, Qingpu County. Later, he and Chen Shihong, Xue Xiaomingzi, Fang Ruihe, Shitou Xiaodi and others successively kidnapped Yang Shuyuan in Mocheng Town, Changshu County, and Dayun Temple in Pinghu County, Zhejiang. Chen Yousheng confessed, also known as Xue Xiaomingzi, since he met Zhang Yaofei and others, he repeatedly robbed residents' shops and kidnapped tickets together in Mocheng Yangshuyuan, Changshu, Huanan, Songjiang County, and Dayun Temple in Pinghu, Zhejiang. Commander Shen considered that Gao Guiyou and others had formed gangs and acted recklessly, robbing everywhere with weapons. They committed numerous crimes in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, and local security was ravaged by them. Xun (洵, truly, indeed) is guilty of heinous crimes, and the law cannot be avoided. He was sentenced to death and submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval, and an order was issued to carry out the execution. So yesterday morning at eight o'clock, he ordered the guerrilla captain Fang Yue to bring the three criminals to the Wangshudun execution ground and execute them by firing squad.</p>

<h3>Continued Report on the Murder of the Husband</h3>
<p>Gu Yunsheng (i.e., Yinsheng), a villager from Shangtang Village near Erfang Langxia (Lower Market), Eighth District of the county, was murdered and abandoned by his lover Sun Awu, his adulterous wife Gu Zhang, and his adoptive father Jin Lin (i.e., Sun Enrong) on the night of the 20th of this month (yesterday’s mistranslation of Ding Enrong). The details of the case have been recorded in this newspaper. Now it is known that the deceased, Gu Yunsheng, was a Taoist priest by profession and made a living in Shanghai. He has now resigned and returned home. His wife, Zhang, often argued with him because her husband had no income. Recently, the weather has been hot, and the couple has been living separately. Yunsheng took a fan door and lived outside the door of another room. On the night of the 20th, the lover and the adulterous woman suddenly became murderous, and they killed Yunsheng and abandoned him in the river. When the reporter went to the countryside to investigate, he saw blood stains on the broken summer cloth mosquito net with green and white patterns left by the deceased, as well as blood stains on the mat and on the ground. The cruelty of the murder can be imagined. After the incident, the neighbors on the left and right did not know about it until the corpse of Gu Yunsheng was suddenly discovered in the territory of Wusantu on the (23rd), lying face down in the water. The back and abdomen were floating on the surface of the water. He was naked all over, and his arms, waist, and legs were tightly tied with hemp ropes. A bottomless stone mortar was tied to his feet. The corpse was swollen like a water buffalo, and the skin color had turned purple and black. As for the murderers Sun Awu, Gu Zhang, and Jin Jinlin, they have now been transferred from the Sixteenth Branch to the General Bureau and then to the County Court. Yesterday (25th) morning at eight o'clock, Inspector Ren Guanghai, accompanied by Inspector Wang, and bailiff Cheng Xi, hired a civilian boat and had it towed by the Changshu liner to the countryside for an autopsy. As for the results of the autopsy, due to time constraints, they will have to be reported tomorrow.</p>

<h3>Fundraising to Rebuild Qiu Pavilion</h3>
<p>Wu Qingsheng of Baiguan, in order to restore the ruins of Qiu Pavilion, invited fellow villagers Hu Xisheng, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, Li Jisheng, Chen Heqin, Zhu Yunlou, Yu Yixuan, He Zhongxiao, and others to initiate fundraising for construction costs. The general letter stated that the Yongshao Railway Station in Baiguan Town, Shangyu County, is an important route for merchants. Next to the station is the Shun River, home to many relics of Emperor Shun, especially the Qiu Pavilion recorded in the Geography section of the Book of Han. Yan Shigu's annotation states that Shun hid from Danzhu here. We believe that Shun's filial piety can revitalize the moral principles of the Republic of China, and Shun's spirit of concession can resolve the disputes among the great powers. The pavilion has been in ruins for a long time. We admire the same virtues and are eager to rebuild it. However, the labor and materials required are enormous. If contemporary luminaries do not come forward to assist, it will be difficult to see the pavilion completed. We admire your advocacy of morality and your efforts to reverse the declining social customs. We earnestly request your generous donation to commemorate the ancient site, etc. The Dashun Temple in Baiguan has been designated as the preparatory office, and the Dachangyuan Paper Shop on Wangping Street in Shanghai will be the collection point.</p>

<h3>Song Ziwen Returns in Glory from Tour of Europe and America</h3>
<p>Arrived in Yokohama Yesterday, Leaves Kobe Tomorrow, Arrives in Shanghai on the 29th, Docks at Pudong Dalaida Pier</p>
<p>Leaders from All Walks of Life Prepared for Grand Welcome</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, attended the economic conference in England and visited the United States, Italy, Germany, and France. He visited the authorities of various countries and boarded the President Jefferson of the Dalaida Company in Seattle on the 13th to return to China. According to news from the Dalaida Company, the ship passed Yokohama yesterday (the 25th), will arrive in Kobe today, leave Kobe for Shanghai on the 27th, and is expected to arrive in port on the 29th, docking at the Pudong Dalaida Pier. A grand occasion is expected at that time.</p>
<p>Representatives from Beijing and Shanghai Prepare to Welcome</p>
<p>Song, accompanied by his secretary Huang Chunpu and American advisor Dr. Young, is returning to China on the President Jefferson of the Dalaida Company. He passed Yokohama yesterday and will arrive in Kobe today. He will depart from there on the same ship for Shanghai tomorrow and is expected to arrive in port on the 29th. The Shanghai Preparatory Committee for the Welcome of Mr. Song has designated Wang Xiaolai and 13 others as representatives to go to the pier to welcome him. In addition, it is reported that Minister of Transportation Zhu Jiahua, Director of the Department of Health Liu Ruiheng, and Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi are all expected to come to Shanghai in the next few days to prepare for the welcome.</p>
<h3>Banking Circles Claim the Trip a Success</h3>
<p>Mr. Song has been abroad since April, almost four months. In addition to first establishing the U.S. cotton and wheat loan to help the country's rural areas and industries when he first arrived in the United States, he also established technical cooperation with the League of Nations and formed the Nine-Nation Silver Agreement with the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Portugal, Mexico, India, Australia, and Canada. According to people in banking circles, technical cooperation is very beneficial to our country, so Japan is increasingly jealous and opposes the silver agreement even more. The most important thing for our country to attend this World Economic Conference was the stabilization of silver prices. This World Economic Conference consumed so much energy and money from various countries, but ultimately achieved nothing. Only our country, the United States, Mexico, and other countries established a silver agreement, which is also the greatest achievement internationally. After the countries concerned approve the agreement, the price of silver can gradually stabilize. Our country is a silver-using country, and if the price of silver is stable, the benefits to the industrial and commercial sectors will be considerable.</p>
<h3>Central Government Has Important Cases Awaiting Discussion</h3>
<p>It is reported that the central government has many important cases that need to be discussed with Mr. Song after he returns to the country.</p>
<p>It is said that the central government intends to convene an important meeting to discuss foreign affairs, finance, and domestic issues immediately after Mr. Song arrives. However, it is not known where this meeting will be held. However, after Song arrives in Shanghai and rests briefly, he will go to Nanjing and then to Jiangxi to visit Chiang. Therefore, it is generally observed that the meeting may still be held in Jiangxi.</p>
<h3>Local Party Headquarters Announces Participation</h3>
<p>Notice: Comrade Song Ziwen, Minister of Finance, was dispatched abroad to participate in the economic talks invited by the U.S. President, and then attended the World Economic Conference in the United Kingdom, and made diplomatic efforts with European and American countries, gaining the sympathy of various countries. The successful negotiation of technical cooperation with the League of Nations is particularly important for the future of our country's construction. His achievements are outstanding and highly admirable. Now that he has completed his return to the country and is about to arrive in Shanghai, all sectors of the city are actively preparing for the welcome to express their admiration, and a preparatory office has been set up in the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. This announcement is hereby published to all groups in the city to register with the office before the 27th of this month to participate in the preparations. Special announcement.</p>
<h3>Hunan Provincial Party Headquarters Sends Welcome Telegram</h3>

<p>Kong Xianrong Will Return to Defense</p>
<h3>Thanks Rear Support for Assistance</h3>
<p>Kong Xianrong, former Deputy Commander of the National Salvation Army of Jilin Province under Wang Delin, arrived in Shanghai on the Canadian Empress last month on the 18th. After more than a month, he has mostly taken care of the affairs of the dependents of the various departments and plans to return to defense within a few days to reorganize his subordinates. Yesterday, he sent a letter to the rear support to say goodbye and express his apologies. The original letter said, respectfully, since Xianrong was trapped in Dongning, he left the country in a hurry, painfully entering Russia. The return journey was tens of thousands of miles, lasting more than a hundred days. He turned to Shanghai in shame. He was grateful for your excessive encouragement and lending, without scolding. After repeatedly reflecting, he was uneasy. Once, the mother of Xiaobai forgot the heart in Ju, and Goujian often held the Zhiwu ambition. Thinking about the past, how dare you live in peace? I am willing to risk my life as a pioneer, wanting to destroy this and eat in the morning. The journey is hasty and I cannot leave. I hold the reins to clarify and dare not forget you. I send this letter to express my apology and hope that you will be aware of it. Kong Xianrong, respectfully, 25th.</p>
<p>Rong Zongjing Talks About the Reasons for the Sharp Drop in Flour Prices</p>
<h3>American Cotton Controls Each Factory Awaiting Song's Return for Consultation</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Sound News visited Rong Zongjing, the leader of the flour industry, yesterday afternoon and asked about the reasons for the sharp drop in the prices of American cotton, American wheat, and flour in recent days. He gave the following detailed account.</p>
<p>(Reasons for the Sharp Drop in Flour Prices) According to Rong, the sharp drop in flour prices this time, as far as I know, is unprecedented in the past 20 years. The market price once reached 2.6 yuan, but now the lowest is only 2.18 yuan. Although it has recovered slightly today, it is still difficult to expect a turnaround in a short time. According to my prediction, the price of flour may recover after a month. The reasons can be roughly divided into two points: 1. The North China flour market has gradually been taken over by Japanese flour and Soviet flour this year, resulting in a sharp reduction in sales channels. 2. In the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas, merchants in rural towns and villages have recently used the engines of irrigation machines, equipped with flour mills and screens, to specialize in collecting old bags from various flour factories and selling flour milled in various counties. This avoids factory taxes and other taxes, and because the expenses are not many, the profits are quite considerable. Recently, they have also been installed on ships to mill and sell flour everywhere, which has greatly affected the sales of factory flour. I recently investigated this matter in Wuxi. The rise of this new business has almost spread to various counties in Jiangsu Province, such as Yixing, Liyang, Danyang, and Wuxi. Therefore, the sales channels of flour from various factories have also been reduced, and the market price cannot be seen to be good. However, this matter is closely related to national tax revenue, and the authorities must also pay attention to it.</p>
<p>(American Wheat Arrives in Shanghai in October) Rong continued to talk about the problem of American wheat being transported to China, saying that American wheat being transported to China is generally in mid-October. The arrival of American wheat has no impact on the market. However, this year's domestic wheat production is also very abundant, and it remains to be discussed with Minister Song how to deal with it.</p>
<p>(American Cotton Control Issues) As for the issue of American cotton control, due to the decline of domestic yarn factories, how to distribute and sell it is still a matter worth considering. Domestic yarn factories will always have to use some amount in the future, but this year's domestic cotton production is also high. There must be appropriate arrangements for these two large amounts of cotton, so that they can be used to their advantage. Therefore, as soon as Minister Song returns to the country, the various yarn factories will first consult with the Ministry of Finance on everything.</p>
<p>Japanese Goods Are Suddenly Active Again</p>
<h3>North China Cloth and Yangtze River Seafood A Sigh of National Mourning: The People Have Forgotten the National Crisis</h3>
<p>The Nissin, Osaka, Daito and other ships that go to Dalian and Tianjin every day are full of Japanese goods. Japanese yarn is also suddenly crowded to the northeast, which is rare since the September 18th Incident. It must be recorded.</p>
<p>(Cloth Transported to Tianjin) The inferior goods piled up in various Shanghai docks have recently been transported to Tianjin, causing the Nissin, Daito, Osaka, Showa and other North China liners to export almost every ship fully loaded. Piece goods are especially common. Yesterday alone, more than 1,400 pieces were loaded. Various Japanese shipping companies have further reduced shipping rates, so the number of reporters is increasing. Japanese goods transported to Qingdao have also been continuous within this week.</p>
<p>(Cotton Yarn Transported to the Northeast) Since the middle of this month, the accumulated goods from Japanese yarn factories in this port have changed their sales direction due to the poor Yangtze River route and have been vying to sell to various places in the Northeast. The puppet state is giving all kinds of conveniences and special treatment to the transport of Japanese yarn, so that in the past two weeks, out of the 34,000 pieces of inventory in Shanghai, 10,000 pieces have been transported to the puppet state. The second batch of 10,000 pieces will continue to be loaded.</p>
<p>(Seafood Transported to the Yangtze River) In the Yangtze River ports, the Nissin Company's Yangtze River upstream ships have been carrying Japanese seafood in the past ten days, each time ranging from two to three hundred pieces. Japanese sugar is also gradually being loaded, with about one to two thousand bags loaded per ship. Japanese goods seem to be launching in the Yangtze River.</p>
<h3>Eight Thousand Workers at British American Tobacco Company Go on Strike Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The Trade Union Scheduled to Hold a General Meeting</p>
<p>Invites All Sectors to Request Assistance</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency said that the strike at the British American Tobacco Company's old factory in Pudong has been going on for many days. Because the factory's attitude is firm, the storm has expanded. Yesterday, more than 4,600 workers at the new factory also joined the strike.</p>
<p>(Eight Thousand Workers Go on Strike) Since more than 3,000 workers at the old factory went on strike to support the factory's dismissal of Worker No. 146 of the leaf tobacco section, the Party and government agencies have repeatedly mediated, but the factory has ignored them. Therefore, the workers held a representative meeting on the 16th and decided that the new factory would also join the strike on Friday (yesterday) to provide assistance. At 7 a.m. yesterday, the new factory followed the resolution and went on strike, but still entered the factory without working. The number of striking workers is now about 8,000. Yesterday, all departments of the old and new factories, except for water and electricity, were shut down (the factory's water and electricity are self-supplied).</p>
<p>(Sends Letters to All Sectors Requesting Assistance) The Fifth District Cigarette Workers' Union believes that the general strike of the two factories will not be resolved in a short time, so it has prepared official letters yesterday to request assistance from all sectors. On the one hand, it has scheduled an emergency representative meeting at 4 p.m. on the 18th to discuss how to respond to the situation, such as whether to expand the strike, etc. At 2 p.m. on the 29th, it will invite the press on the ninth floor of the YMCA to report on the truth of the labor unrest. At 2 p.m. on the 30th, it will invite various public organizations to request assistance in writing or financially.</p>
<p>(Publishes a Declaration Presenting Nine Points) The Trade Union also issued a lengthy declaration yesterday, detailing the factory's various acts of suppressing the labor movement and destroying the Trade Union. The nine major points are presented as follows: 1. Revise the contract and disobey dismissal; 2. Arbitrarily set factory rules and deprive benefits; 3. Illegally record demerits and dismiss workers; 4. Disobey orders and refuse to resume work; 5. Violate the contract and destroy education; 6. Obstruct fee collection and suppress the labor movement; 7. Increase speed and reduce work; 8. Refuse to pay wages during the shutdown; 9. Use running dogs to alienate unity. The above nine points all have detailed explanations and historical evidence, but the length is too long to omit. There are also 13 slogans that are also omitted.</p>
<p>Li Liejun Will Return to Shanghai at the End of the Month</p>
<h3>Still Lingering in Jiujiang for Private Matters</h3>
<p>Central Committee Member Li Liejun was summoned to Jiangxi by Chiang Kai-shek to discuss the aftermath of the patrol bureau. It was rumored that he would take a boat back to Shanghai yesterday, but according to news from the Li residence, Mr. Li is still lingering in Jiujiang for private matters and is expected to depart for Shanghai at the end of the month.</p>
<p>The Anti-War Association, Marlay, etc. Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<h3>It is Said That Japan Will Send a Representative and Marlay Plans to Go to Peiping</h3>
<p>Lord Marlay, the chairman of the World Anti-War Association, and a Belgian representative went to Japan and have now returned to Shanghai on the German ship Aeneas, arriving at 3:30 p.m. yesterday. Mr. Marlay and others did not leave the Jianghan Customs pier until about 5 p.m. According to an interview with the reporter of the New Sound News, after arriving in Japan, he contacted Japanese cultural groups and asked them to send representatives to Shanghai. He has now received official news that Japan will send representatives, but how many people and who will be sent are still unknown. Mr. Marlay did not mention the incident of being refused entry into Japan. As for the United States' attitude towards the association, he said that he had no opportunity to contact the United States, so the United States' attitude is unknown. Mr. Marlay also said that he hopes to go to Beiping soon. The date and location of the meeting in Shanghai will be announced after they have discussed it at a meeting.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post said that Ms. Wilkinson, a former British Labor Party member of Parliament, also wanted to come to Shanghai to participate in the anti-war conference. Today (25th), British representative Hamilton denied this statement, saying that Ms. Wilkinson had never intended to come to Shanghai. The origin of this statement is probably because Ms. Wilkinson accompanied Lord Marlay to Madrid, and the British newspapers speculated that the two would go to China together. In fact, Lord Marlay said goodbye to Ms. Wilkinson in Madrid and went to Marseille alone, where he joined the other representatives and came to Shanghai. As for Barbusse, he was unable to come to Shanghai because of poor health. He visited Barbusse in Miramas, Rivera, in March and saw that he was weak and ill, and it was impossible for him to attend the meeting. As for the various rumors and misunderstandings about Katayama, Lord Marlay will return to Shanghai on the Aeneas today, and Mr. Marlay will issue a statement, which he cannot answer. However, he believes that Katayama is not in Japan and still lives in the district. As for the Shanghai Baojing Association's claim that a preparatory meeting will be held at the Shanghai YMCA in Baxianqiao, as far as he knows, it is not true. Also, as for applying to the Public Concession authorities for permission to hold a meeting within the concession, it must be handled after Lord Marlay returns to Shanghai, and the application has not yet been made. Lord Marlay will arrive in Shanghai this afternoon, and the representatives in Shanghai are prepared to take a ferry to meet him. The Municipal Council will also send special patrol officers to take care of him to prevent overly enthusiastic students from marching and demonstrating.</p>
<h3>Customs Administration Changes Consular Visa Manifests</h3>
<p>Tang Haian, the Superintendent of Jianghai Customs, and Robert Bredon, the Commissioner of Customs, issued a joint notice No. 1313 yesterday, which said that in order to notify all matters, it was found that the method of changing Article 9 of the Regulations on Consular Visa Manifests issued by the Consulate of the Republic of China abroad was opened in this Customs Notice No. 1240. Now, the Customs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has ordered to change and handle it as follows: From September 1 of this year, for all foreign goods arriving in China, if the merchant fails to submit the manifest for inspection when picking up the goods, regardless of whether the merchant can report it, the number of manifests to be collected according to the export price of each bill of lading shall be temporarily paid to the Customs at three times the original certification fee. It is limited to six months to send the original manifest to the Customs for re-inspection without error, and the Customs will return the paid fine. If the manifest is not sent for inspection after the deadline, the Customs will impose a penalty. The above methods should be followed and implemented, and all merchants should be aware of it. This is a special joint notice.</p>
<h3>Movements of British Embassies and Consulates</h3>
<p>The North China Daily News said that Sir John Brenan, the British Consul-General in Shanghai, is expected to return to his post in mid-December. However, the current Acting Consul-General Davison will take leave of absence from Shanghai in advance, because the incumbent Consul-General Blackben will return to his post on December 1 after the expiration of his leave, so he can act as Consul-General. It is also heard that British Minister Lampson will come to Shanghai for a trip before leaving for the UK after his term of office. The details are still unknown.</p>
<h3>The Two Ministries of Finance and Industry are Planning to Levy Dumping Duties on Foreign Goods</h3>
<p>Ten Types of Taxes Determined for Assessment</p>
<p>To Be Implemented Regularly After Song Returns Home</p>
<p>Tax of One Taels Per Ton Already Levied on Imported Japanese Coal</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the two ministries of Industry and Finance believe that the dumping of foreign goods in the market in recent years has led to a slump in domestic product sales. This has severely hindered the progress of industry in our country. They are therefore referencing the "Regulations on the Tax Law for Dumped Goods" promulgated by the National Government in September of the 20th year of the Republic of China. They are preparing to levy a dumping tax. Since the start of this process, the examination of goods has been completed, and ten types of goods have been determined for taxation. Once Finance Minister Song returns to China and after further discussion, it can be implemented regularly. It is also heard that a tax of one tael of silver per ton has already been levied on imported Japanese coal. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Examination Completed) In order to determine the criteria for each type of goods to determine if they are being dumped, the two ministries of Industry and Finance jointly formed a "Dumping Goods Review Committee." It was established in the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing, with an office in the Jianghai Customs in Shanghai. The relevant department heads of the two ministries of Industry and Finance are responsible for investigating the dumping of foreign goods in China, establishing categories of taxable goods, and requesting the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to order consuls stationed abroad to investigate the prices of various goods in their vicinity to determine whether the dumping is true. This investigation procedure has now been fully completed, and only awaits the return of Finance Minister Song for further review before it can be announced and implemented.</p>
<p>(Number Determined) The standard for collecting this dumping tax does not apply to all goods, but is limited to foreign goods that directly conflict with our country's products and hinder the sales of domestic products. Currently, ten types of goods have been determined for taxation, namely cotton yarn, silk, tea, cloth, rice, wheat, timber, fish, light bulbs, and matches. Other essential foreign goods will continue to be subject to import duties as usual, and will not be subject to dumping taxes.</p>
<p>(Levy on Japanese Coal) A reporter from the Huadong News Agency visited a committee member of the Shanghai Office of the Dumping Association yesterday. According to the committee member, the collection of foreign goods dumping taxes is primarily intended to benefit both the government and the people. The standard for the types of goods to be taxed is based on those that can be supplied to the market by our own domestic production. This allows domestic products to develop despite being excluded due to the devaluation of foreign goods. However, due to the lack of domestic goods, if dumping taxes are levied and foreign goods are sold at high prices in the market, the public will suffer. Therefore, careful consideration must be given and implemented step by step. It is planned to first levy taxes on imported foreign goods such as cotton yarn and flour, possibly starting on October 1st. Next, the issue of dumping taxes on imported foreign coal is extremely important. Currently, Japanese Fushun coal and British Kailuan coal are both being dumped in China. The procedures for collecting dumping taxes are extremely complicated. For the sake of considering all parties, careful discussion is necessary. As a compromise, a tax of one tael of silver per ton has already been levied on imported Japanese coal, as a temporary measure.</p>

<p>This City Levies Land Value Tax</p>
<h3>Yao Wenhan and Others Petition for Postponement, Awaiting the Mayor's Return for a Decision</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the Municipal Government decided to levy a provisional land value tax, it has drafted the regulations for collection and submitted them to the Executive Yuan and then to the Legislative Yuan for approval. Currently, the Municipal Government is ordering the Land and Finance Bureaus to actively handle the collection procedures. However, recently, citizens such as Yao Wenhan have submitted a petition to the Municipal Government requesting a postponement. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically inquired about this matter to the Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Yu Hongjun. Yu said that Mayor Wu is in Beijing on official business and that this matter is of great importance. He cannot express any opinion until the Mayor returns to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Aviation Association Prepares Naming Ceremony for Five Aircraft</h3>
<p>The naming ceremony for the five aircraft, scheduled for September 9th at Hongqiao Airport, has already been reported in the newspapers. It is now heard that regarding the arrangements for the venue, the Chief of the First Section of the Municipal Government, Li Dachao, along with two people from the Municipal Security Office and two people from the Public Security Bureau, went to inspect yesterday (the 25th) at 10:00 AM. They plan to arrange the venue in a thorough and secure manner, for the comfort of the audience.</p>
<h3>Formation Flying</h3>
<p>It is also heard that after the naming ceremony of the five aircraft, a total of six aircraft, including Shanghai's No. 1 aircraft, will be formed into two squadrons for a performance. It is also heard that another four aircraft will escort them to Shanghai. On that day (the 9th), there will be a total of ten aircraft flying over the city.</p>
<h3>Distributing Flowers</h3>
<p>It is also heard that the Ningbo Native Place Association in Shanghai sent a letter to the office of the Aviation Association at Eight Immortals Bridge yesterday, stating that the owner of the Meiyuan Restaurant, Mao Heyuan, plans to scatter flowers when the "Ningbo" aircraft flies over the city to add to the interest. If so, the public's elegant mood at that time should be very high.</p>
<p>Taxation Department Replies to City Chamber of Commerce on Deadline for Yarn and Cloth Sales</p>
<h3>Limited to One Year, Extendable by Six Months</h3>
<p>The Taxation Department replied to the City Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "In reply, we have received your letter of August 17th and have carefully read it. Regarding the issue of tax-paid goods imported from Shanghai to Xiamen and then transferred to the interior of southern Fujian, or small vendors from southern Fujian coming to Xiamen to purchase retail goods for sale, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce previously sent a letter with the same content. This Department has investigated that the tax payment for cotton yarn and woven goods is valid for one year according to regulations for transportation and sales, and can be extended for six months. Within the period of one year and six months, the tax-paid certificate can still be exchanged for a modified transportation certificate, and another nine months of validity can be obtained. Therefore, the actual validity of tax payment is two years and three months. This is a general case, how can it vary from place to place? As for penalties, there is a special chapter, even if merchants have indeed committed illegal acts, they should be dealt with impartially, and not arbitrarily lenient or severe. If, as the original letter stated, the unified tax authorities in the interior of Fujian Province are deliberately making things difficult and imposing harsh fines on yarn merchants transporting goods, it is certainly inappropriate. However, the original letter is too general and there is no basis for verification. The association should provide a clear and specific indication of each case of difficulty and harsh fines for thorough investigation. The newly promulgated Unified Cotton Yarn Tax Inspection and Penalty Regulations, one copy each, have been sent to the association and the Fuzhou Sub-Regional Unified Tax Administration Office has been instructed to investigate and seriously rectify each case. Based on the situation in the letter, we hereby reply for your information."</p>
<p>The Engineering Department of the National Economic Council Sends Personnel to Mengjin to Investigate Disaster</p>
<h3>500,000 Transferred to Yellow River Flood Control Association</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the Yellow River has burst its banks, causing disaster in Henan, Shandong, and other provinces. The central government has now ordered six provinces to organize a Yellow River Flood Control Committee to take full responsibility. Yesterday, a reporter inquired at the Engineering Department of the National Economic Council on the Bund. According to the Technical Team Leader, Li, the information received by this Department about the Yellow River disaster is the same as reported in the newspapers. This Department sent two employees to Mengjin, Henan Province, a few days ago to conduct an investigation. The original First Supervision Office of this Department is located there and is responsible. As for the Yangtze River Flood Control Association, the funds previously raised have been partially transferred to the Yellow River Flood Control Association. It is understood that the Yangtze River Flood Control Association originally raised 600,000 yuan. After spending 100,000 yuan, the Yangtze River suddenly receded and no major disaster occurred. At that time, the Yellow River was in a state of emergency, so the remaining 500,000 yuan was transferred to the Yellow River Flood Control Association. The Yangtze River Flood Control Association was also dissolved at that time to facilitate the work. Director Xi (Dejiong) is still residing in Shanghai and has not gone elsewhere.</p>
<p>Iron Industry Association Replies to City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3>Regarding Pei Chang Company, There are No Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Iron Industry Association replied to the City Chamber of Commerce, stating, "In reply, we received your letter the other day, stating that the Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association sent a letter stating that the Blood Soul Corps accused Pei Chang and Shen Tai Companies of selling Japanese goods, and asking why they were not restricted, and requesting an inquiry and reply. Upon receiving the letter, we found that Shen Tai is a member of the Hardware Association and cannot be investigated. However, Pei Chang is indeed our member. Previously, after seeing a report in the newspaper, the association had already sent personnel to investigate and found no Japanese goods at all. Because Pei Chang Company had already published a statement in the newspaper, we did not ask them to correct it further. Now that we have received your letter, we have again forwarded it to Pei Chang, instructing them to reply immediately. According to their reply, since the September 18th Incident, our company has never sold enemy goods. The source of goods can be verified by the books. However, the pig iron produced by the Liuhegou Company has always been distributed by our company. According to the oral agreement between our company and the Liuhegou Company, the distribution period of our company should expire at the end of September this year. Before the expiration date, it is not allowed to be distributed by other companies. However, the company disregarded the oral contract and, at the request of the Shanghai Copper, Iron, and Machinery Industry Association, began sales before the expiration of our company's distribution period, causing inevitable conflicts in business. When the Machinery Industry Association first reported the sales of Liuhegou pig iron on August 4th, they also sent people to our company in the name of the association to negotiate, accusing our company of selling enemy goods, but ultimately returned without any evidence. At the same time, our company also received a warning letter from the so-called Blood Soul Elimination Corps. Our company believes that patriotism should not lag behind others, and we absolutely hate being told the truth. Moreover, the business reputation is well-known and cannot be designed to be destroyed by others. Therefore, we are unwilling to deal with those who slander and destroy, and we simply ignore the unfair competition from our opponents. Now that we have been asked, we are briefly stating the facts. You should know that three people in the market can cause fear of a tiger, and rumors should be a warning. The story of Zeng Shen killing someone is ultimately false. We hope you understand and reply accordingly. It has been verified that our members were the first to boycott and the strictest to eliminate Japanese goods since the September 18th Incident. There are no Japanese goods to sell, and investigations have not been slackened to this day, and no findings have been made. Only Pei Chang Company, due to the pig iron business, often has fierce conflicts of interest with others due to business competition, resulting in constant slander. The stories become more and more bizarre. We lament the difficulty of doing business and the decline of social customs, and are particularly saddened. We do not want to say more to avoid misunderstandings. The Blood Soul Corps also sent a letter to our association, and we believe that the Corps is a righteous organization, and should seek facts and not make unfounded accusations, lest they be used by others. Therefore, we have not answered. In short, if the company is indeed greedy for profit, disregards righteousness, and superficially agrees but secretly opposes, our association will never condone it, and we welcome faithful reports. If it is destroyed for no reason, we will also defend it to uphold justice. This matter concerns the reputation and credit of our members, and we must truthfully report it. We hope you will review and reply accordingly. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Iron Industry Association, August 24, Year 22."</p>

<h3>Senior Kuomintang Member Lin Huanting Passed Away Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to the Far East News Agency, Mr. Lin Huanting, a senior member of the Kuomintang, suffered from a heart attack for less than three days. Medical treatment was ineffective and he passed away at 5:00 AM yesterday. Mr. Lin dedicated his students to the revolution and had no concept of fame, and was deeply trusted by President Sun. In recent years, he founded the Minzhi Bookstore to enlighten the people and promote doctrine, engaging in the basic work of the National Revolution. The news of his death was shocking and mourned by those who heard it. Lin has three sons, Hanlun, Hanhua, and Hanxing. The eldest son, Hanlun, who is recovering in Lushan, rushed to mourn after hearing the news. Mr. Lin's body will be encoffined at 4:00 PM on the 27th and the funeral will be held at 2:00 PM on September 2nd. Attached is a brief biography of Mr. Lin, Lin, whose courtesy name is Yeming, was from Shunde County, Guangdong Province, and was 53 years old. Thirty years ago, he was the leader of the Annam branch of the Tongmenghui. During the Hekou Longzhou uprising, he planned the finances with President Sun. After the failure of the revolution, he continued to promote revolutionary work in the British and Dutch colonies. He then went to Hong Kong and founded the Zhenbao newspaper. In the third year of the Republic, Long Jiguang moved the Hong Kong government to seal the Zhenbao newspaper, and he was imprisoned. Later, with the assistance of President Sun and various comrades, he was released after half a year. He then followed President Sun to work at the headquarters of the Chinese Revolutionary Party in Tokyo. Later, he came to Shanghai and worked as a general affairs officer at No. 44 Huanlong Road, and served as the Minister of Finance of the Party. On the order of President Sun, he founded the Huaqiang Minzhi Bookstore to publish works on the Party's doctrine, as well as other scientific books. After the Northern Expedition was completed, Lin was unwilling to become an official. For many years, he managed President Sun's Mausoleum, collected President Sun's posthumous works, and worked practically in the Party for decades. He was kind and approachable to people. The news of his death was shocking and mourned by the entire Party.</p>

<p>The Trainee Technicians of the Electric Machinery Factory Were Dismissed and Returned to the Bureau</p>
<h3>Workers Request a Temporary Postponement of Receiving the Factory</h3>
<p>After the Ministry of Communications ordered the suspension of the Telecommunications Machinery Manufacturing Factory, the workers of the factory still insisted on resuming work. After the receiving personnel sent by the Ministry came to Shanghai, they have not yet taken over the factory. The trainee technicians sent by the Ministry were dismissed and returned to their original bureaus yesterday. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>(Trainee Technicians Sent by the Ministry Leave the Factory) After the factory was suspended, the 15 trainee technicians sent by the Ministry of Communications to the factory were ordered to return to their original bureaus. After receiving the order, the factory director, Yu Ruxin, paid the salaries of the 15 people yesterday and provided travel expenses based on the distance of each trainee technician's original bureau. The technicians are scheduled to leave the factory today.</p>
<p>(Temporary Postponement of Receiving the Factory) The Ministry of Communications previously sent technician Zhang Hongtu and section member Zhang to Shanghai a few days ago to take over the factory. After Zhang and others arrived in Shanghai, they stayed at the China Hotel. They must wait for the custodians sent by the Ministry to come to Shanghai before they can jointly proceed. As for the factory workers, in addition to cabling Military Committee Chairman Chiang to appeal the establishment of the factory and requesting the Ministry of Communications to withdraw its order, the workers also elected representatives to Zhang, the receiving personnel, requesting Zhang to first receive the factory's materials, stationery, and documents during the takeover, and to temporarily postpone receiving the factory. It is heard that this matter will be handled after the custodians arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>(Technical Staff to be Reassigned) As for the factory's reporters and technicians, because they have nothing to do every day after the factory was suspended, they requested the factory director, Yu Ruxin, yesterday to forward a request to the Ministry of Communications to reassign them as soon as possible. Mr. Yu has already forwarded the request on their behalf.</p>
<h3>The Red Swastika Society Receives Telegrams from Two Counties Requesting Relief</h3>
<p>The Yellow River's flood in Zheng County has been disastrous this time, causing extreme suffering in the provinces along the river. The Shanghai General Office of the Southeast Main Branch of the World Red Swastika Society received a telegram from the Zhengzhou branch yesterday, appealing for help for the disaster victims. The original telegram is transcribed below: Shanghai General Office, the Yellow River has burst its banks, and all the areas along the river in Wen, Hua, Lan, and Wu counties have become submerged. The flood has leveled houses, and the severity of the disaster is indescribable. Those who survived have gathered on high ground, and the disaster victims are suffering from hunger and cold, crying for food. The situation is unbearable to hear. Our society has released emergency relief, but our strength is limited and it is difficult to cover everything. We hereby send a telegram appealing for you to quickly assist in providing relief to save our compatriots. Zheng Swastika Society, respectfully. It is reported that after receiving the telegram, they have sent telegrams to the general society and other branches to raise funds to provide relief.</p>
<p>The Bandit Disaster in Fuyang: The Cruel Situation of the Bandit Disaster in Yingfu, Anhui, has been repeatedly reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that fellow villagers in Fuyang have sent another telegram appealing to the Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society, describing the disaster situation and requesting relief. The original telegram is transcribed below: To the Shanghai General Office: Our county is unfortunately suffering from repeated calamities, and the current bandit disaster is even more cruel. Although it has only been a dozen days, villages and market towns within a hundred miles have been burned down. Men, women, old and young, those who are not dead are kidnapped, and few escape. Those who are dead are lying in corpses across the fields, and no one is burying them. Moreover, at this time of scorching sun and disaster, decay is very easy, and the stench is overwhelming. Therefore, as soon as the bandits retreat, the plague arises. Fuyang is located in a remote corner, and transportation is always difficult. After the bandit disaster, medicine is lacking. It seems that the people of Fuyang who do not die from bandits will die from the plague. Considering that your society has been providing relief for many years, providing both medicine and rice, we dare to beg you to show great compassion and distribute a large amount of aid, so that it can be sent to the Fuyang Charity Association to distribute it and save hundreds of thousands of people who are about to die. We will be eternally grateful for your kindness. Fuyang Fellow Villagers Association in Beijing, respectfully. It is reported that the office has replied to the association, informing them that a special commissioner has been dispatched to investigate and handle the relief efforts.</p>
<h3>Qu Yingguang and Others Request Relief for Disaster Victims in Chahar Province</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Joint Association of Charitable Organizations for the Relief of Northeastern Refugees received a telegram from Qu Yingguang and Feng Xuefen, two standing directors in Peiping, addressed to Xu, Lao, Wang, Yilao, Huang Hanlao, Zhao, Lao, Huang Bolao, and all colleagues of various charitable organizations: We have just received a telegram from Chairman Song Yang of the Chahar Provincial Government stating that the disaster situation in Chahar Province is extremely serious, especially in the counties in the war zone, such as Shichang. People are starving everywhere, and ten out of ten houses are empty. The suffering of those who are displaced is unbearable to witness. We feel deeply concerned and treat everyone equally. We urge the relief association to show great compassion and go to the county to investigate and provide emergency relief to save the disaster victims. Chahar Province has suffered from years of famine and banditry. Its misery does not need to be said. It is the responsibility of this association to provide relief to refugees, and we should treat everyone equally and conduct investigations and relief efforts. However, the current relief funds and the previously allocated 15,000 yuan, solely for Zunhua, Fengrun, Qian'an, and Miyun counties, are already insufficient. Baocheng and other counties are vast and severely affected by the disaster, and a small amount of relief funds cannot provide assistance. We respectfully request you to consider the importance of the disaster in Chang and other counties, show great compassion, widely appeal for help, and raise more relief funds so that relief can be provided as soon as possible. Qu Yingguang and Feng Xuefen, respectfully.</p>
<h3>Sharp Increase in Japanese-Owned Cotton Spindles in China</h3>
<p>A recent report in this newspaper, "The Actual Situation of Japanese Yarn Dumping in China," stated that according to a survey by the Ministry of Industry, there are 42 Japanese-owned yarn factories in China, with a total of 1,582,056 spindles. However, according to the recent three-year statistics of the Chinese Cotton Mill Association, this number does not match. According to the investigation, there were 45 Japanese-owned yarn factories in China in 1930. In 1931, the Qingdao Gongda Yarn Factory, originally divided into five factories, changed its organization and merged into one factory, resulting in 41 factories. There are still 41 factories now, and there has never been a period of 43 factories. There were 82 Chinese yarn factories in 1930, 84 in 1931, and 89 from 1932 to the present. As for the total number of spindles in Japanese-owned yarn factories in China, there were 1,630,436 in 1930, 1,715,792 in 1931, and 1,790,748 from 1932 to the present. Comparing the total number of spindles in 1930 with the number surveyed by the Ministry of Industry, there is still a surplus, so the survey by the Ministry of Industry should be the total number before 1930. As for the total number of spindles in Chinese yarn factories, there were 2,383,474 in 1930, 2,465,304 in 1931, and 2,637,413 from 1932 to the present. According to this ratio, the number of Japanese spindles in the midst of high-sounding boycotts of Japanese goods after the September 18th Incident is still higher than in 1930, with an increase of as much as 160,312.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Will Convene a National Cooperative Conference</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cooperative Enterprise Promotion Association, in view of the fact that the special cooperative law has not yet been promulgated by the government, the regulations of provinces and cities are very different, the terminology of national cooperation has not yet been unified, and the methods of national cooperation have not yet been perfected, which are the most urgent defects to be corrected. The association's eighth executive committee has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry to convene a national cooperative conference to discuss the overall plan for promoting cooperation and various individual issues. Later, at the eleventh executive committee meeting, it was decided to send representatives Shi Bo and Chen Weifan to Beijing to request the Ministry of Industry to promptly convene a national cooperative conference to discuss the overall plan in order to prepare for solving the national economy in the future. It is now known that the association's representatives Shi and Chen recently went to Beijing to visit the Ministry of Industry, where Shen Zuxiang of the Agricultural Department received them. He highly praised the association's request and said that the cooperative law will be promulgated soon, and the national cooperative conference will be convened after the promulgation.</p>

He and several friends had a private room, No. 618, in the Xinxin Hotel on Guizhou Road, as a meeting place. The sign on the door read Tan. Huang had a private car and a bodyguard named Huang Yongquan, 24 years old, a local. Every afternoon, he would go to No. 618 to chat until about 11:10 last night, when Huang and Huang Yongquan walked out of the room and went to the elevator on the south fifth floor, intending to take the elevator downstairs.</p>
<p>(Gunshots at the Elevator Entrance) As they walked to the elevator door, two middle-aged men in gray gowns suddenly emerged from the staircase railing on the sixth floor, each holding a pistol, and fired four shots at Huang Yonghua and Huang Yongquan from behind. They were shot in vital areas and almost collapsed. Fortunately, the elevator arrived at this time, and the driver bravely stepped forward, dragged the two into the elevator, closed the iron gate, and opened the elevator at full speed from top to bottom. The other passengers in the rooms heard the alarm and panicked, and the murderer took the opportunity to escape in the chaotic crowd.</p>
<p>(One Suspect Apprehended) Huang Yonghua and Huang Yongquan were sent downstairs by the elevator operator and immediately rushed to the front desk to report. At this time, two off-duty West Detectives were passing by Guizhou Road. Upon hearing the situation, they immediately telegraphed the Zhabei Police Station and reported everything. A large number of detectives were dispatched to the scene of the incident, and ambulances were sent to the Renji Hospital on Shandong Road to rescue the two. At the same time, police were dispatched to guard each exit and search for the murderer. As a result, a suspect was found at the gate, wearing a white silk gown, with many blood-like stains on the right lapel. He was immediately taken to the police station for questioning.</p>
<p>(Huang Yonghua Dies) After Huang Yonghua and Huang Yongquan were sent to Renji Hospital, the doctors examined them and found that Huang Yonghua had been shot twice, once in the abdomen and once in the waist. The bullets were inside. Just as they were about to perform surgery to remove them, he died in the hospital at 11:35 PM due to excessive bleeding and damage to vital organs. The hospital reported this to the Zhabei Police Station and sent the corpse to the morgue. The deceased was wearing a white silk gown, white silk short shirt and pants, black silk socks, and satin shoes. His face had pockmarks. Huang Yongquan was shot once in the right chest, the bullet passing through his back. The injury was also severe, and his life was not yet guaranteed. After the incident, reporters inquired from all sides and learned that Huang was an inspector of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Fire in a Japanese Residence, a Secret Room Discovered in the Rubble</h3>
<p>Seven Large Boxes of Heroin Found in the Room</p>
<p>And a Set of Drug Manufacturing Equipment</p>
<p>丨One Burned to Death, One Injured, Owner's Whereabouts Unknown丨</p>
<p>At 11:50 the night before, a loud noise suddenly came from No. 1 Huang Lu Road, at the end of North Sichuan Road, followed by a fire that could not be contained. The Japanese Marine Corps was nearby and immediately dispatched troops to stand guard, as if a major change was about to occur. At the same time, the Dixwell Road Police Station received an alarm and immediately notified the fire department to drive to the scene to put out the fire. It was not extinguished until about 1:30 AM yesterday. The entire second floor of the house was destroyed. The residents of the house were all Japanese, named Nagasawa Yoshi. However, as the owner could not be found after the incident, it was feared that he had been buried in the fire. The firefighters searched through the rubble and unexpectedly discovered two unexploded hand grenades, which were larger than ordinary ones. At the same time, they found a corpse that had been burned to death and an injured man. After identification, they were found not to be the owner. The injured person was rushed to Fumin Hospital on North Sichuan Road for treatment. Continuing to dig through the rubble, a secret room was discovered in the corner of the wall. Upon entering and checking, it was found that the interior contained a set of drug manufacturing equipment, seven large boxes of heroin raw materials, and various anesthetics. At this point, the police station realized that the owner must have fled in fear. They first took the various items to the police station and then sent detectives to investigate the whereabouts of the owner. At about 4:00 AM yesterday, it was learned that the owner was hiding in the home of a friend, Iwai, at No. 311 Dongxingli, Wusong Road. The police station notified the Japanese Consulate and went to arrest him together. He was found and arrested at the scene, taken to the police station, and transferred to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation. It is unknown how he will be dealt with. However, according to the results of the police station's investigation, it was learned that several Chinese were also helping to manufacture drugs at No. 1 Huang Lu Road. They had fled after the incident and are now being hunted down. As for the cause of the fire and whether it was caused by the explosion of a bomb, it is still difficult to determine and is under investigation.</p>
<h3>Zhang Xueliang, Who is Traveling Abroad, is Sued in Shanghai for Unpaid Debts</h3>
<p>Trial Scheduled for September 7, Summons Cannot Be Served</p>
<p>Court Announces that Defendant is Expected to Appear on Time to Avoid Default</p>
<p>Before the September 18th Incident, Zhang Xueliang, the former chairman of the Beiping Military Branch, built a new house in Shenyang. When it was about to be completed, the Japanese army had already occupied Shenyang. Zhang owed the Westerner Haman, who was in charge of the construction, over 200,000 yuan in construction costs. He had repeatedly demanded payment but had not been paid. When Zhang resigned and went south, Haman followed him to Shanghai. He hired lawyers A. 낙만 and Tian Heming to sue Zhang in the Second Special District Court to recover the debt. The trial was scheduled for September 7, but because Zhang had gone to Italy and was traveling abroad, the court summons could not be served. Yesterday, it was published in the newspaper as a public notice. The original text said: Public Notice of Service by Publication of the Second Special District Local Court of Shanghai, Jiangsu. Regarding the case of Haman versus Zhang Xueliang for debt, because the whereabouts of the defendant Zhang Xueliang are unknown and the documents cannot be served, the plaintiff Haman has applied for service by publication, which has been approved. This court has now scheduled 11:00 AM on September 7 as the date for the public hearing. All documents that the defendant should receive will be served by publication in accordance with Article 153 of the Civil Procedure Law.

<p>Li Xuechun Surrenders in Connection with the Major Robbery Case</p>
<h3>Li Jinxiang Cries Upon Seeing Him, Then Suddenly Curses Him</h3>
<p>Li Jinxiang, 21 years old, from Suzhou, the wife of the notorious gangster Li Along, nicknamed "Scarface Along," who was involved in the sensational 129,080 yuan major robbery case on Yong'an Street in the French Concession, lived upstairs in the Huaxingchang Rubber Teeth Shop at No. 58 Fumin Road inside the Xinbei Gate. However, because Along did not engage in legitimate business and was only associated with bandits, he was away from home all day long, causing discord between the couple. Zhou Xuechun, 17 years old, the son of Zhou Yupei, the owner of the Zhou Yuanchang Rosewood Shop at No. 48 Lujia Lane, met Li two years ago and developed an affair. It was not the first time they had been intimate. After the major robbery case, Along gave Li 5,000 yuan of the stolen money for safekeeping. Later, Li gave the stolen money to Xuechun for safekeeping and rented a house together at No. 337 Annerkin Road in the French Concession. Unexpectedly, Xuechun suddenly became ill-intentioned and took the remaining 4,000 yuan of stolen money and fled. Afterwards, Li searched everywhere without success and only managed to grab Xuechun's elder sister, Zhou Aibao, and forced her to hand over Xuechun, resulting in a conflict. The police arrived and took Li, Aibao, and others to the police station for questioning. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. It is now learned that the French Police Station sent detectives Qin Youyu and others to the police station to bring Li Jinxiang to the French Police Station. Yesterday morning, they escorted her to the Second Special Court's Eighth Tribunal, where lawyer Yuan Jiahuang explained the case and said that the police station was prosecuting her for receiving stolen goods. While she was being questioned, lawyer Ye Fokang suddenly announced that Zhou Xuechun, who was involved in the case, had surrendered himself for questioning and had not escaped. Police station lawyer Yuan stated that Zhou Xuechun was being investigated by the police station. Now that he has surrendered, he should be handed over to the police station for investigation. Whether or not he has committed a crime will become clear. When Li Jinxiang saw Zhou Xuechun, she suddenly burst into tears and glared at him, full of hatred. She pointed at Zhou Xuechun and said, "You actually stole the money and fled to Nanjing, enjoying yourself! You made me get sued!" Judge Sun Pengwei ordered both defendants to be detained and adjourned the hearing to the 29th. After the adjournment, Detective Qin took the male and female defendants down and took a rickshaw together to the Songshan Road Police Station for detention pending investigation.</p>
<p>The Case of the Missing Jiaobao</p>
<h3>What is Zheng Wenxiang's Relationship? Zhu Zhengshan Released Without Involvement</h3>
<p>Sun Yushun, 50 years old, from Shaoxing, who resides at No. 115 Run'anli, Ximen Road, French Concession, and operates the Sun Shunji Silk Weaving Factory, has a wife, Wu, 46 years old. They only have one son, named Jiaobao, also known as Dongru, 6 years old, who is lively and lovely and often plays in front of the door. At 11:30 AM on May 20th of this year, Jiaobao was playing alone outside the gate and suddenly disappeared, suspected of being abducted by a kidnapper. People were immediately sent out to search everywhere, and reports were made to the police station and the Public Security Bureau. People were also sent to guard various docks and stations, but there was no trace of him. While the couple was anxious, they received a letter from the post office on the third day, stating that the child Jiaobao was safe and that 8,000 yuan was required for his return. A total of nine letters were received, with two corners cut from the clothes the child was wearing attached to the letters. At this point, the Sun couple realized that the child had been tricked and kidnapped for ransom. However, the letters did not contain a contact point, only instructions to post the reply on the door. Sun followed the instructions, and Zheng Zhou, the concubine of Zheng Wenxiang, the director of the Daguangming Law Office who had moved into the Sun family on April 20th, often asked the Sun couple if they had received any letters from the kidnappers, saying that as long as they paid the money, they could get the child back. Zheng Wenxiang also told Sun to increase the reward. Zheng and his concubine often visited the Sun family. At this point, Sun agreed to pay the money, increasing it from 80 yuan to 1,000 yuan, and entrusted Zheng and his housemate Qiu Yaoshan to carry out the task, but they still could not redeem the child. The Sun couple suspected that Zheng and Qiu were not good people and were conspiring with the bandits to demand money, but they were afraid that their son would be harmed and did not report it to the police station. On July 29th, the French Police Station received an anonymous letter reporting that an illegal organization was established at No. 115 Run'anli (i.e., Sun's house). Detectives were sent to search the premises. At that time, Zheng Wenxiang jumped out of the window of the rear wing and escaped. After searching, the detectives found no evidence of a crime but learned about the kidnapping and ransom of Sun's son. They returned without any clues or evidence. After that, Zheng did not return home. On the 13th of this month, the police station received another report stating that the kidnappers involved in the kidnapping case in Run'anli were hiding at No. 203 Dongfang Hotel, Xizang Road. Detective Yang Yilong led a team of detectives to the Sun family to inquire. The Daguangming Law Office was already deserted. They then went to the Dongfang Hotel to arrest the suspects. However, the suspects had moved to Room 516 of the Far Eastern Hotel. They then went to the Far Eastern Hotel to make the arrests. Upon inquiry, it was learned that the room was opened by lawyer Zhu Zhengshan. They arrested Qiu Yaoshan, Min Xinhao, Li Liaoqing, Zheng Wenxiang's concubines Zheng Lou and Zheng Zhou, and two children, one in swaddling clothes and one six or seven years old, along with Zhu Zhengshan. They were taken back to the police station. While heading towards the elevator, they apprehended Zhou Wenying, a woman who was visiting. They were all taken back to the police station for questioning. Zhu Zhengshan was released without involvement. Qiu and others were escorted to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. This newspaper previously reported only the general situation because the wanted criminal Zheng Wenxiang was still at large and the case was under investigation. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian held a trial in the First Criminal Court. First, police station lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case and presented nine ransom letters received by the victim as evidence.</p>
<p>Then, the victim Sun Yushun and his wife surrendered themselves and explained the circumstances after the child's disappearance. They also hired lawyer Wang Shizong as their agent and requested to file a private prosecution to recover the child from the defendants. The official ordered the defendants to be brought down and individually questioned. Each defendant denied conspiring with the bandits to kidnap the child for ransom. Finally, lawyer Jiang Yiping, hired by the defendant Zheng Lou, made a statement. By this time, it was past noon. The official ordered the defendants to be returned to custody and adjourned the hearing to September 9.</p>

<p>Consumption Quantity and Value of Aquatic Products in July</p>
<h3>Published by the Municipal Fisheries Guidance Institute</h3>
<p>Shanghai has a population of over 3 million. In addition to rice and wheat, which are the main staples, fish and meat are the most important part of the people's food. Regarding the aquatic product part, the Municipal Fisheries Guidance Institute has been conducting daily surveys and statistics on the monthly consumption quantity and value and its sources in this city, and issuing monthly reports to various sectors. According to the person in charge of the institute, the consumption quantity and value of various aquatic products in this city in July have been surveyed. The total weight is 120,149 dan, an increase of 8,922 dan compared to the previous month. The value is 1,578,494 yuan, an increase of 162,991 yuan compared to the previous month. Among them, marine fish accounted for 64,008 dan, with a value of 600,7592 yuan. River fish accounted for 18,725 dan, with a value of 339,412 yuan. The rest are various seafood, various salted fish, and canned fish. No Japanese fishing vessels were imported this month. According to the Shanghai fish price this month, it is slightly lower than the same month last year. The reasons are mostly due to uneven distribution and underdeveloped transportation. It was previously reported that the Ministry of Industry will work with the Shanghai Municipal Government to set up a fish market to regulate people's food and develop production. If so, not only will China's future fishery be promoted and developed, but also the future of people's food will be greatly benefited.</p>

<p>Further Interrogation of the Case of Patrolmen Beating People and Destroying Property</p>
<h3>Emergency Meeting of the Fourth Branch of the Second Municipal Federation</h3>
<p>Shu Yuanhe, the owner of Yiqingyong Wine Store at No. 76 Luli Road, Nanyang Bridge, in the French Concession, had a conflict with police officers from the Second District Police Station the day before yesterday. When he was beaten and arrested, the French Concession police officers were unable to stop it. As a result, he was detained at the Second District Headquarters, as briefly reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the case has been handled by the political affairs department of the French Concession police and the lawyer hired by Shu Yuanhe, who have negotiated with the district. Director Jin sent Shu to the headquarters, and Shu was released in the evening. Because Shu Yuanhe suffered several injuries and was in extreme pain, he personally took pictures of his bloody clothes and trousers as evidence in court. He also sent letters to the Wine Industry Association and the Nanyang Bridge Citizens' Federation, requesting them to forward the letter to the Second District Police Station to negotiate the prompt return of the ten loads of wine that had been detained after taxes had been paid. At about 1:00 PM, he hired a car to go to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office to request an examination of the injuries and an order for the police to arrest the police officer with badge number 1154 and other patrolmen who committed the violence and to investigate and handle the case.</p>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Federation, located at Nanyang Bridge in the French Concession, received a letter from the Yiqingyong Wine Store, a member located at the Nanyang Bridge intersection of Luli Road, reporting that a patrolman from the Second District Public Security Bureau had crossed the boundary and stabbed the store owner. Therefore, it held an emergency meeting at 8:00 PM the night before last. In addition to the executive committee members, representatives from various stores were present to listen. The standing committee member Hua Ruizhai was elected as the chairman. The chairman first reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the association had received a letter from its member Yiqingyong reporting that patrolman No. 1154 of the Second District Public Security Bureau mistakenly believed that the store had failed to affix tax stamps. After certification from the Tax Bureau, the patrolman illegally crossed the boundary to the store, disrupted business, gathered a large number of detectives, and started a fight, destroying all the store's wine vats, wine jars, and wine cans. He also threatened them with a gun and stabbed the store owner with a knife. After this incident occurred, the store owners who witnessed the situation were greatly angered. Therefore, today's meeting is extremely important, and we should discuss how to deal with it. Then, the representative of Yiqingyong reported the situation at the time of the incident in detail. The following resolutions were made: (1) Based on the letter, protest to the French authorities due to insufficient police force. (2) Submit a request to the municipal government to investigate the police officer who caused the incident and punish him severely to appease public anger. (3) Notify the business community to wait quietly for the association to negotiate reasonably. (4) Organize a committee to actively negotiate, and appoint Hua Ruizhai, Xu Changqing, Xia Shanxiao, Tong Lizhang, and Xu Yanwu as members to be responsible for handling the matter. (5) Report to the general association, requesting a discussion on appropriate measures to protect citizens. (6) Send representatives to慰问the injured store owner. (7) Investigate the fact that the area is an important intersection between the Chinese and French Concessions. Traffic disputes often arise between vehicles traveling in opposite directions, and a request should be made to the municipal government to make changes. (8) The member will handle the criminal and civil lawsuits on his own. After the above resolutions were made, the vacancy of the former standing committee member Wang was discussed. It was resolved that Dong Wenli, who received the next highest number of votes, would fill the position of standing committee member, Xu Yanwu would be an executive committee member, and Xu Changqing would be a representative to the general association.</p>

<p>Li Qingfeng, the Famous Gambling Association King of Hongkou, Arrested</p>
<h3>Instigating Assault: Fined Sixty Yuan, Not Guilty of Other Charges Due to Insufficient Evidence</h3>
<p>The listening posts set up by gambling associations in various places have been repeatedly investigated and arrested by authorities in the Chinese and leased territories. These people have many hiding places, making it difficult to arrest them. Recently, Li Qingfeng, a Jiangbei native known as the King of Gambling Association Listening Posts, also known as Tan Qingfeng, 43 years old, residing at No. 57 Qingyun Lane, Xihuade Road, established several listening post agencies in places such as Dongyouheng Road and Huishan Road. He employed many rogue boatmen to solicit residents to gamble in gambling associations, swindle money, and earn thousands of dollars a month. Those who were harmed were ruined. There were even cases of suicide due to gambling debts in gambling associations and not being able to make up the debts. The matter was known to the police, and they were in the process of arresting him. Yao Caigen, a Ningbo native and a capable boatman assigned by Li, was questioned and investigated by Xu Shanji, also a Ningbo native, because he had not turned in enough of the gamblers' money. He was not allowed to go to the listening post, otherwise he would be dealt with severely. Yao then left without saying goodbye. At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, while passing near Shangxian Lane on Dongyouheng Road, two thugs suddenly jumped out from the side and beat him with clubs until he fell to the ground, shouting for help. Detective Lin Kezhun heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, but the murderers had already fled. He took the injured person to the police station and, after questioning him, sent him to the hospital. The doctor examined him and found that the injuries were minor. After bandaging, he was discharged from the hospital. Detective Lin went to No. 57 Qingyun Lane and arrested Li Qingfeng, but no gambling evidence was found. He was taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Local Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant was a well-known leader of the gambling association and that everyone, old and young, knew about his gambling association. The police have been unable to arrest him. Now that he has been arrested (a hundred or so of his relatives and friends have come to listen to the case, filling the courtroom), he should be severely punished according to the law. Then, the victim Yao Caigen testified about the circumstances of the incident. The two murderers, Jiang Gendi and You Bao (the defendant's son), were indeed instigated by the defendant. Xu Shanji also testified that he worked for the defendant, and when the gambling association opened, he would report the name of the gambling association to the defendant, who would then tell him to notify Yao Caigen not to change it, otherwise he would ask him if he wanted to "eat the price." The court did not understand this term, and the police lawyer explained that it was the same as what the rogues called "knowing what's good for you." When questioned, the defendant denied being the head of the gambling association and denied instigating the assault. He also hired a lawyer to defend him. Judge Xiao Yinfen sentenced Li Qingfeng to a fine of sixty yuan. He was found not guilty of the other charges due to insufficient evidence. The police lawyer requested bail during the appeal period. The court granted the defendant bail of three hundred yuan.</p>
<p>A Sad Cry Immediately Breaks a Fraud Case</p>
<h3>Wang A Si's Intimidation Ignored, Shen Jinchu's Alertness Captures the Criminals</h3>
<p>Wang A Si, also known as Mao A Si, a 30-year-old from Tongzhou, has no steady job and no fixed address. He usually engages in extortion. The other morning, he colluded with Chen Zhaorong (aka A Bao, 28 years old), who claimed to be a detective from the Fourth District, Seventeenth Squad of the Maritime Public Security Team. The two of them went to the Jilun ship going to Fuzhou at the South Pier. They saw Chen Wangshi (29 years old), the concubine of Wang Youchen Yizeng, holding an infant on the ship. They falsely claimed to Chen Wangshi that Chen Yizeng owed Wang one hundred silver dollars and that they did not know his address. Therefore, Wang A Si took the child from Chen Wangshi and tricked her into going ashore to Room 30 of the Dongfang Hotel at Xiaodongmen, where he threatened Chen Wangshi that she had to repay the debt, or he would hand her over to the authorities. By coincidence, Shen Jinchu, a detective from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, was also staying in Room 32 next door to handle a case. He heard the women crying very sadly. He immediately went to investigate, but the door was locked. He peeked through the keyhole and saw two men resembling thugs and two women, including a woman kneeling on the ground with a child, begging. He reported the information to the team, and Gu Liancheng, the detective leader, detectives Hu Kuisheng, Shen Yushan, and female detective Han Fengying rushed to question them. The men had moved into Room 29. Chen Wangshi accused Wang A Si and Chen Zhaorong of forcing her to come here and demanding money, and asked for help to return home. Therefore, they took the two criminals and Chen Wangshi, along with the child, back to the team. Yesterday morning, after investigating, they confirmed that Wang had extorted money and prepared a document to send them to the Third Division for punishment.</p>
<p>A Counterfeit Liushen Pills Operation Cracked</p>
<h3>Establishing a Medicinal Material Shop as a Cover</h3>
<p>Disguised as merchants to Arrest Vendors -- National News Agency. Leiyunshang Songfentang Medicine Shop's main store is located in Suzhou and has been there for more than 200 years. The Shanghai branch, opened outside the New North Gate at No. 251 Minguo Road, has also been there for more than 70 years. The two drug stores' annual business income is about one million yuan, which is quite developed. Among its main valuable medicines, Liushen Pills are particularly famous. They are expensive, costing 1.4 yuan per point of weight. They are widely sold in the Nanyang Islands, Dalian, and all provinces of the country, and the profit is very high. Therefore, they are coveted by ordinary people, who counterfeit the drug store's Liushen Pills and sell them in provinces and cities, such as Chongming and Taizhou. They are wholesale transported inland, filling the markets and villages. Recently, Lei Xianzhe, the owner of the Leiyunshang Medicine Shop, came to Shanghai from Suzhou a few days ago and asked someone to help him and reported the information to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting that Detective Captain Lu Ying arrest the counterfeiters. Lu Ying transferred the responsibility to detective leader Chen Caifu to secretly investigate. At about 9:00 AM yesterday, it was learned that Yang Zhengming from Chongming was in charge of the counterfeit operation. He colluded with Gui Hanjiang from Baoshan, Tan Youcai from Waisha, and Ji Ruidin from Chongming to establish a general wholesale agency called Yutai Medicinal Material Shop at No. 151 Xiangua Street, outside Xiaodongmen in Nanshi. They counterfeited Liushen Pills, ginseng tonic pills, and other drugs, and made several kinds of boxes made of rawhide and colored Liushen Pills, with counterfeit printed prescriptions attached. They also contacted Xu Jindao from Nanhui and Lin Jinjiang from Chongming to establish a large medicinal material shop near Hengxing West Lane, No. 1 Limadu, hired salesmen to peddle their products, and made a lot of money. Chen Caifu reported the information to Captain Lu, who sent the original case officers to disguise themselves as vendors and go to the two agencies with the police at about 10:00 AM yesterday. They arrested the shop owner Xu Jindao and his partner Lin Jinjiang, and at the Yutai wholesale agency, they arrested the shop owner Yang Zhengming, his partner Gui Hanjiang, and his apprentices Tan Youcai and Ji Ruidin, for a total of six people. They found a lot of evidence and took it to the team to file the case. All the criminals were detained. It is said that the team has ordered the six criminals, including Yang, to be sent to the Third Division for punishment.</p>

<h3>Abandoned Child of Three Years Now Recognized</h3>
<p>Zhao, the wife of Shi Xinnian, a Funing native living in Jiangwan Township, was having lunch at home three years ago when Chen Wushi, a neighbor woman, came to her and said that there was a several-month-old girl crying on the nearby grass, and suggested that Zhao adopt her as a daughter. Zhao had no children, so she went to take the child home and raised her for several years. The child was already able to walk. Unexpectedly, the day before yesterday, Gao Ruming and his wife Gao Sunshi, Taixing natives living at No. 59 Decheng Lane, Yangshupu, claimed that during the Shanghai war, Gao Sunshi took her daughter Xiaomei, who had just been eight months old, back to her hometown. She bought a ticket at the North Station, but mistakenly took the train to Jiangwan. She wanted to exchange money, so she put the child on the grass in the garden. When she returned, the child was gone. Three years have passed and she has not been found. Now that someone has reported that the child is here, she has come to claim her. Shi believed that it was difficult to determine whether the child picked up several years ago was a fake, and firmly refused, so a conflict occurred. They were taken to the Fifth Division police station and transferred to the local court for trial yesterday.</p>

<p>Shenbao Dajian Today, your newspaper published a news item about Yuan Xilian being innocent, saying that Yuan Xilian represented his client Lin Zhongwen in accusing Chen Kan. After the Second Special Zone Court opened the court many times, Chen failed to appear in court, so he requested the judge to issue an arrest warrant, which was approved by the court. This is not consistent with the facts. At that time, I went to Fujian to petition, and there was no fact that the court was opened many times and I failed to appear in court, and there was no court order approving the arrest warrant. The case is on appeal. Yuan Xilian's client has been convicted for this, and Yuan Xilian's guilt or innocence will be determined in the future. Please correct it, Chen Kan, August 25, 22nd year.</p>

In total, there were more than 60 attendees. More than 100 leaders of Qingdao's various organizations and groups attended the opening ceremony. It was presided over by President Ma Yinchu. Reporters 　 Yi 　 　 and Guilin from the Xinsheng Nengxun News Agency recorded the event. Hu Jiagong, Liang Shuming, Zhou Zuomin, and Chen Guangfu gave successive speeches. In the afternoon, the municipal government hosted a tour of the urban area and various factories. Starting from the 25th, papers will be read. The detailed information is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>After the Chairman's Report and the opening of the meeting, President Ma Yinchu reported, saying briefly that the Society has been established for nearly ten years, and the total number of members has reached more than 600, of which two-thirds are scholars who study economics, and one-third are entrepreneurs engaged in finance and industry. Its role is to closely connect theory and facts. In our country, bad habits have been followed for a long time. Those who study theory often ignore whether the facts are compatible, and only make high-sounding remarks. Although the reason for this may be due to political relations, which do not allow them to approach the facts. Therefore, the reason for our country's weakness is not entirely due to this drawback. In Germany, the opposite is true. Those who study theory are based on the actual situation of the facts, and those who are engaged in practical business also compromise on the results of theoretical research. Commentators say that the foundation of Germany's prosperity is based on this. The Society's invitation to the leaders of various industries is also intended to follow this idea. The research results of the members are published in the Society's series, which is published by the Commercial Press. In addition, there is a quarterly magazine, as well as trade statistics between China and Japan and industrial surveys of Shanghai. In previous annual meetings, except for the first two, which were held in Beijing, the rest were all in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. This year, Qingdao is a major port in the East. In recent years, municipal construction has made daily progress. In the future, its position in our country's military affairs and industrial and commercial industries will be even more important. Therefore, we came here to hold the tenth annual meeting to take the opportunity to visit and study. We do not dare to make any contributions to the people of Qingdao. We really hope that the leaders of Qingdao's municipal administration will give some advice to the Society.</p>
<p>Compilation of Speeches. Next, Hu Jia 　, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Shen, saying briefly that the 　 Society held its tenth annual meeting in Qingdao this time, setting a new record that the city has never had before, which really added luster to Qingdao. The 　 economic power is related to life 　 　 is extremely important. 　 The economy 　 can be 　 　 reformed, and life 　 　 　 cannot be fully resolved. Whether it is personal life, social communication 　, or national security 　, it is all 　 closely related to economic problems. Especially if the national economic policy is not perfect, there is no politics to speak of. Regarding Qingdao's economic problems, we urgently hope that the gentlemen attending the meeting will give us directions, so that we can 　 follow them. In order to make it easier for you to understand the economic situation of this city, the municipal government has specially 　 made small publications and distributed them to you for reference. At present, the population of Qingdao is increasing sharply, and although the property of Chinese and foreigners is increasing year by year, there is an abnormal state, that is, there are few producers and many non-producers. In other words, there are few factories and more. Therefore, the development of the market is extremely slow. We hope that you will give more guidance and relief in this regard, etc. 　 Mr. Liang Shuming's speech was entitled "The Special and Difficulties in Solving China's Economic Problems," saying briefly that each country has its own economic situation, and economic situations are different, that is, economic policies are also different. 　 For example, the United States and China are different. China's production is backward, while the United States has surplus production, and its policies certainly cannot be the same. Now China should study technological progress and industrial development. However, the above problems must be viewed in terms of their environment, status, and whether the facts allow them. Now our country's politics is not on track, and we want to solve China's economy, which is why it is especially difficult. The economic problem must first look at how the political problem is. If you want to study politics, you must first study the social situation. In my opinion, there are only two paths for economic problems: one, free competition, which requires local security and peace, and no wars, so that people can freely invest in competition; second, unified planning, which is a further step than the first line, because countries do not allow us to compete freely at present. We only have to take the second path, but whether the second path can pass depends on how the politics are. If the politics are bad, then the economists cannot talk about 　, etc. Next, Zhou Zuomin gave a speech on "The Relationship between Industry and Finance in North China," and Chen Guangfu gave a speech on "Discussions on the Transformation of the Current Economic Problems in China," both of which were able to give detailed explanations. Finally, Chairman Ma Yinchu delivered a speech of thanks, and the meeting dispersed after photography. It was decided to discuss the papers on the afternoon of the 25th.</p>

<p>The First Day of the Rotary Cup China-Portugal Final: Zheng Zhaojia Wins Three Straight Sets Against Xun Na</p>
<h3>Wang Wenzheng Fails to Defeat Corazza</h3>
<p>Score: 3-6, 4-6, 6-0, 6-6 (Unfinished)</p>
<p>The Singles Continuation Match Will Be Held at 3:30 This Afternoon, Followed by Doubles</p>
<p>Although Wang Wenzheng defeated Zheng Zhaojia in the China Open Tennis Singles Championship, he failed to defeat Portugal's Corazza in yesterday's Rotary Cup International Tennis Final. Although Wang displayed his inherent skills, they were all broken by Corazza, causing Wang to nearly exhaust his wisdom and strength, and lose the first and second sets consecutively. The scores were 3-6 and 4-6. Wang won the third set 6-0. In the fourth set, Corazza won the first two games. Wang won five games in a row, thinking victory was in sight, but Corazza caught up to 5-5. Wang then won one and lost one, making it 6-6. At 6:10 p.m., the sky was full of dark clouds, visibility was poor, and heavy rain was imminent, so the match was stopped. They will continue the match this afternoon.</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia was originally scheduled to play against Portugal's Marcel, but Xun Na, the runner-up in last year's Grass Court Tennis Club Junior Singles, was temporarily substituted. Zheng won 6-4, 6-4, 6-1. The performance was not very exciting, and the situation was not tense. Zheng's hitting technique has improved, but his racket swing is still extremely slow, giving the opponent time to arrange their position, which reduces the tension of the match.</p>
<p>About four to five hundred people watched the match at the Chinese Tennis Court, showing great interest in Corazza's match against Wang Wenzheng. However, a few unruly individuals often shouted out of turn, or made unnecessary applause, and often shouted "out" or "good ball," disrupting the order, which is not an appropriate phenomenon on a tennis court.</p>
<p>The linesmen were all temporarily pulled from the stands and often could not fulfill their duties. Mistakes were inevitable, and there was often no clear indication of whether the ball was out. This is all due to a lack of training. The umpires also seemed to lack keen eyesight.</p>

<h3>Corazza Overwhelms Wang Wenzheng</h3>
<p>(Loses Two Sets in a Row) Wang Wenzheng lost both of his service games, while Corazza won two service games in a row. In an instant, Corazza won all four games. Wang then served, taking the lead three times first (40-0), but Corazza won four straight times, putting Wang in danger again. However, Wang was finally able to return that game and take Corazza's service game, making it 2-4. In the sixth game, although Corazza lost, he performed well, often attacking Wang's backhand with deep shots, taking advantage of the opportunity to rush to the net, which won him a lot of applause from the audience. In the last three games, each won their service game, and Corazza won the first set 6-3. In the first game of the second set, Corazza served and lost 15-40 (1-3), but then recovered the game and took Wang's service game, making it 2-0. Wang added two games, making it a tie. In the following three games, Corazza won again, making it 5-2, and his hope of victory was very high again. Among them, in the sixth game, Wang served and failed with a slice four, Wang took the eighth game, Corazza served and won 40-0 first (3-0), but was reversed by Wang, but the tenth game still went to Corazza, making it 6-4. Corazza won again.</p>
<p>(Too Late to Recover) After Wang lost two sets in a row, the spectators were amazed. The intensity of the competition between the two was rarely seen. The situation was very tense, and the excitement increased. Wang's skills showed no sign of decreasing, but his opponent was good at running, returning the ball quickly and accurately, and various hitting techniques, persevering and enduring. Wang could not break through. At the beginning of the third set, Corazza suddenly lost his sharpness, with many mistakes, and seemed like a different person before and after. Wang won all six games very easily. In the fourth set, Corazza returned to his original state, winning two games in a row. In the third game, Wang had the advantage, but Corazza had a net touch, and the ball landed on the other side of the net, making it a tie, thus winning the game. Under this dangerous situation, Wang tried to rally, and the two fought more fiercely, neither letting go, and the excitement increased. Wang then won five games in a row, creating a superior situation. In the sixth game, the two high-lobed and blocked, running east and west, and were able to save themselves from danger, winning warm applause. At this time, if Wang won another game, he could win the set. Unexpectedly, things did not go as planned, and Corazza won three games in a row, making it 5-5. In the tenth game, Wang served and lost and was very disappointed, but Corazza's service game was also met with a slice four by Wang, and Wang then took the lead again, but the twelfth game was won by Corazza again, making it 6-6. At that time, the wind was strong, the sky was dark, and it was full of rain, and the game could not continue and was stopped.</p>
<h3>Zheng Zhaojia Wins Three Straight Sets</h3>
<p>(Last Year's Runner-Up) The Portuguese player originally scheduled to play Marcel temporarily used Xun Na. It was found that Xun Na was the runner-up in last year's Grass Court Tennis Club Junior Singles, who lost to Sun... Fang in the final. This year's skills have improved quite a bit. Although Zheng Zhaojia won three straight sets, the scores of the first two sets were quite close. Zheng has a good grasp of the diagonal hitting technique on both sides, but his racket swing is very slow, giving the opponent time to arrange their position, and therefore affects the game's inability to be tense. The quick downswing is not only enough to make the situation tense, increase the interest in competition, but also make the opponent unable to step into a fixed position, and it is easy to win. This is the most important thing in strategy, and I hope Zheng pays attention to it.</p>
<p>(Wins Three Sets in a Row) At the beginning, Xun Na had a clear advantage, winning 3-1 and 4-2 first. Zheng slowly caught up, and after tying at 4-4, he won two sets with 6-4. Zheng won three games in the first game, and then alternately won one game each, making it 5-2. Xun Na then added two games in a row, and Zheng finally ended the third game with 6-4. In the third set, Xun Na's sharpness had faded, and he lost again and again, losing six games in a row. Zheng then achieved a record of three straight wins with 6-1.</p>
<h3>Today's Schedule Is Very Heavy</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Wang Wenzheng vs. Corazza did not end, so it was decided to continue the match at the Chinese Tennis Court today. It is certain that neither of them will participate in the doubles match. The outcome of this match is difficult to predict. Corazza's momentum is very fierce, Wang, if he cannot suppress his edge, even if he gets the fourth set, the situation is still very dangerous. This match is scheduled to begin at 3:30, and the doubles match will begin at 4:00. The outcome of this match is also difficult to predict. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Singles Wang Wenzheng vs. H Corazza 3:30 p.m.</p>
<p>Doubles Zheng Zhaojia and Yu Tianguang vs. S Corazza and Costa 4:00 p.m.</p>

<h3>Simple and Economical Power Supply Checker</h3>
<p>—Ming Xiang</p>
<p>When alternating current (AC) radios have problems, precise instruments and electrical meters are required for testing. Such instruments are very expensive, difficult to use, and can be easily damaged. The checker described in this article is economical and simple, and is sufficient for testing the power supply section of ordinary radios.</p>
<p>Manufacturing: Most rectifier tubes in ordinary radios are 280 types, and their sockets are UX four-pin types. Therefore, the materials required for this device are only a UX four-pin tube socket, a broken UX-type vacuum tube with the glass tube removed, a six-volt small light bulb, and two small battery clips.</p>
<p>The connections for each component are shown in the diagram: The two ends of the filament (F) on the tube socket are directly connected to the bottom two pins of the glass tube; P and P are also directly connected; a small light bulb is connected in series between G and G; the two clips can be connected in parallel to both ends of the light bulb.</p>
<p>Testing method: During testing, first remove the rectifier tube from the radio and insert it into the socket of the checker. Then, insert the checker into the radio's rectifier tube socket. Observe the brightness of the small light bulb. If the radio is working properly, the small light bulb should only have very slight brightness (except for radios with excessive power). If the small light bulb exceeds half brightness, it indicates that the rectifier tube's load is too high, and you should check for any short circuits, such as if the filter capacitors or bypass capacitors are completely shorted. When the current is too high, the small light bulb can be blown immediately, preventing damage to the power transformer and other components. Therefore, this device can also be used as a fuse. At this time, you should further check where the short circuit is. You can remove the internal components of the radio, leaving the amplifier connected. Remove the small light bulb from the checker and replace it with a 220-volt 50-watt light bulb, connected to the small battery clips. Turn on the radio, but do not leave it on for too long, otherwise components such as the transformer and rectifier tube may be damaged. Observe the brightness of the light bulb, and quickly disconnect the circuits of any suspected components. Then observe the brightness of the light bulb again. If there is no change, then the component is intact and healthy. Test each component in this way until the damaged component is found.</p>
<p>If the brightness of the small light bulb is within the rectifier tube's load-bearing range, you can remove the small light bulb and connect a 0-150mA ammeter to the clips (if you do not have an ammeter, you can observe the brightness of the small light bulb instead). Turn on the radio and note the reading on the ammeter. Then, remove each vacuum tube in the radio one by one, and note the current reduction caused by removing each vacuum tube to compare this number with the plate and screen current that the tube should be drawing. If the ammeter reading does not decrease after removing a certain tube, then you should check whether any of the tube's circuits are interrupted.</p>
<p>If the small light bulb or ammeter shows no reading at all, then you can check whether the filter choke coil and other components in the power supply section are interrupted.</p>
<h3>Avoiding Ground Wire Noise</h3>
<p>—Shi Huayu</p>
<p>The higher the sensitivity and the more amplification stages a radio has, the greater the noise will be. The antenna circuit is very sensitive; even a small voltage change can affect the speaker and produce loud noise. The impact of noise is smaller when listening to local stations, but when listening to stations from other places, we must do our best to reduce noise to a minimum. However, we cannot eliminate the effects of atmospheric electricity, but we can eliminate the noise generated by the antenna and ground wires. Usually, our ground wire is a metal rod inserted into the ground, but often the metal rod and the soil create an electrochemical reaction, and the metal rod becomes an electrode. The potential difference between them can sometimes exceed 1000 millivolts, causing annoying noise in the radio. To avoid this, you can create a non-polarizing electrode to replace the metal rod. The method is very simple and convenient, as shown in the figure: A is an unglazed ceramic cylinder (commonly used in wet batteries, available at physical and chemical instrument stores), B is copper sulfate, C is its pure solution, D is a copper strip for the radio's ground wire post, and E is the ground. D should be immersed in the solution and not connected to other objects.</p>
<p>After assembling all the components as shown in the figure, place the unglazed ceramic cylinder on the ground or insert it into the soil about one or two inches. Because the copper sulfate solution slowly seeps out of the cylinder and comes into contact with the soil, electricity can pass through it. Its function is the same as a metal rod inserted into the ground, but because it does not generate an electrochemical phenomenon, there is no potential difference, and therefore there is no noise in the radio.</p>
<h3>Vacuum Tube Collection</h3>
<p>—Ming</p>
<p>The weight of an electron is 1/46 x 10^36 ounces. Its speed is several thousand miles per second. If the temperature increases, their movement will be even faster.</p>
<p>Materials for making filaments: The materials commonly used for filaments or directly heated cathodes are: 1. Pure tungsten filament, used for high temperatures (bright white); 2. Thorium-tungsten filament, used for normal temperatures (yellow, bright); 3. Alkaline earth metals, often coated with a mixture of oxides, which can function at very low temperatures (dark red). Because the required temperature varies, the applied filament voltage also differs.</p>
<p>AC-DC tubes: Battery-powered vacuum tubes cannot be satisfactorily used with AC power because the emission of electrons and the potential in the space charge also change with each change in the AC power. After amplification by the tube, this change causes an AC humming sound in the speaker. Therefore, filament-cathode tubes need to be specifically designed and manufactured for AC power. The 26-type tube is an example.</p>
<p>Mercury in rectifier tubes: If there is no space charge in the tube, the same number of electrons can be obtained with a lower plate voltage as with a higher plate voltage. One method of eliminating space charge is commonly used in several rectifier tubes, such as the 82-type mercury vapor rectifier tube. This tube contains a small amount of mercury, which is partially evaporated during use. The tube is filled with mercury vapor containing mercury atoms. These atoms are struck when electrons fly toward the plate. If the electrons move at a sufficiently high speed, they will remove electrons from the mercury atoms. In this way, the mercury atoms can be said to be "ionized," meaning that the atom has lost one or several electrons and therefore has a positive charge. When mercury atoms separate electrons due to the impact of electrons emitted by the filament, the space charge (which is the electrons remaining between the filament and the plate, which will repel later electrons) is neutralized by the mercury positive ions. This increases the total number of electrons. The voltage drop between the cathode and plate of a mercury vapor rectifier tube is small (about 15 volts). This drop is practically unrelated to the filament electron emission limit and the required current, but is somewhat dependent on the tube temperature.</p>
<p>Interelectrode capacitances: The electrodes of a vacuum tube form an electrostatic system, and each electrode is like a plate of a small capacitor. In a triode, these capacitances are called "interelectrode capacitances" and exist between the grid and plate, the plate and cathode, and the grid and cathode. Among them, the capacitance between the grid and plate is the most important. In high-gain radio frequency amplification circuits, this capacitance can cause unwanted coupling between the input and output circuits, thus causing uncontrollable regeneration. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Tuning Methods and Steps for Shortwave Transmitters (Continued)</h3>
<p>—Luo Jingyu</p>
<p>(A) Hartley: The Hartley circuit belongs to the inductively coupled type. Because it is easy to generate oscillation, it is very popular. However, it is difficult to change the increase or decrease of the transmitter power, so the overall efficiency cannot be considered very high. Its circuit is shown in the first diagram:</p>
<p>In the diagram, point E can be moved up and down. As a result, the ratio of the number of plate coil turns to the number of grid coil turns is changed. In fact, the coil between points EP is the plate coil, and the coil between points FG is the grid coil. Therefore, if the number of grid coil turns is greater than the number of plate coil turns, its excitation will be large, and the plate current will inevitably increase. Therefore, when we adjust the Hartley circuit, after setting the capacitor C to the degree corresponding to our desired wavelength, we move point F to find the best standard point for oscillation. Generally, from experience, the ratio of the number of plate coil turns to the number of grid coil turns should be four to one or five to one. Also, although C is initially located at the correct degree, the change in the number of grid coil turns has a considerable impact on the wavelength. Therefore, after finding the best point for oscillation, it is necessary to re-calibrate with a wavemeter, and then adjust C to the degree that matches the original wavelength. (Increasing the number of grid coil turns during adjustment will increase the wavelength compared to before adjustment, while decreasing it will shorten the wavelength compared to before adjustment.)</p>
<p>(B) Colpitts: The Colpitts circuit belongs to the capacitively coupled type. Although its structure is the same as the Hartley, the coil has been replaced by a capacitor, so even using an antenna with a small capacitance can achieve good results. At the same time, the adjustment is not like the Hartley, which relies on the movement of point F on the coil, but rather on the change of the capacitor to find the best standard for oscillation.</p>
<p>Figure 2 shows the Colpitts circuit. C2 is used to determine the wavelength, and C3 is used to adjust the oscillation. Because C3 itself has a voltage drop here to act as grid excitation, the change in capacitance of C2 is the change in the coupling ratio between the plate and grid. When we adjust, we set C2 to half (that is, 50 degrees on the scale), and then gradually rotate C3 from the maximum amount (that is, 100 degrees on the scale) until the plate current reaches the minimum point. The degree indicated at that point is the best standard point for the oscillation we want to obtain. Based on this situation, we can also know that the larger the capacitance, the smaller the resistance, and the smaller the voltage drop, so the excitation to the grid also becomes smaller. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>One-Hand Rule</h3>
<p>—Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>If the human body encounters a voltage of more than 100 volts, it is dangerous. With today's AC radios, it is easier for accidents to happen on the plate. It is best to always remember the One-Hand Rule during testing to avoid danger.</p>
<p>For example, if you are working on the B battery and one hand is holding the high-voltage B+, while the other hand accidentally touches B- or the ground wire, the current will pass through your heart, and an accident will occur. Therefore, it is best not to use both hands when working in high-voltage circuits. In emergencies, you must wear a pair of leather gloves.</p>
<p>Similarly, if you are standing on a dirt floor or a damp floor, it is best to wear rubber-soled shoes, or lay a dry wooden board on the floor for safety.</p>
<h3>Common Knowledge About Headphones</h3>
<p>—RF</p>
<p>Headphones are delicate instruments and should not be subjected to strong vibrations or placed in humid environments, otherwise they are easily damaged.</p>
<p>The two pins of the headphone: one pin is red or patterned, and the other is blue or plain. Except for crystal radios where they can be connected arbitrarily, on vacuum tube radios, the red or patterned pin should be connected to the positive terminal of the B battery, and the blue or plain pin should be connected to the plate of the last-stage vacuum tube. Otherwise, over time, the magnetism of the permanent magnet inside will gradually decrease, and the sound of the headphone will gradually decrease, eventually losing its sound effectiveness.</p>
<p>If several headphones are connected to the same radio for use, the plain pin of the first headphone should be connected to the patterned pin of the second headphone, the plain pin of the second headphone should be connected to the patterned pin of the third headphone, and so on. Then, connect the patterned pin of the first headphone to the positive terminal of the B battery of the radio, and the plain pin of the last headphone to the plate of the output tube.</p>
<p>If you cannot determine which pin of the headphone should be connected to the B+, you can arbitrarily connect this headphone to the radio. The pin that is connected to the B+ when the sound is louder should be connected to the B+. Or, connect the two pins of the headphone alternately to a small battery of about 20 volts. The pin that is connected to the positive terminal of this battery when it emits a louder popping sound should be connected to the B+ terminal.</p>
<p>After listening to headphones for a long time, there are often water droplets on the diaphragm, which are condensed from the moisture evaporated by the human body. It is best to gently absorb them with absorbent paper after listening, and do not rub them hard with a coarse cloth to avoid wiping off the rust-preventive coating on the diaphragm, which will cause the diaphragm to rust and the sound to become coarse.</p>
<h3>Simple "A" Battery</h3>
<p>—Zhang Guoquan</p>
<p>This "A" battery is made from a used round dry cell. The output voltage is equal to that of a round dry cell, but the current is weaker. However, it is quite suitable for lighting vacuum tube filaments.</p>
<p>First step: Take an old round dry cell, remove the outer layer, and take out the carbon rod in the middle of the battery. Then make a cloth bag that is slightly larger than the carbon rod, put the carbon rod in, and stuff the powder inside the battery into the bag until it is full. Tie the mouth of the bag tightly with thread, but leave a little of the end of the carbon rod with the wiring screw exposed for wiring.</p>
<p>Second step: Buy some ammonia at the pharmacy and mix it with clean water (about three parts ammonia to ten parts water) and pour it into a wide-mouthed glass bottle (such as a milk bottle) for later use.</p>
<p>Third step: Cut a piece of metal sheet from the outer layer of the round battery. The width should match the bottle opening, and the length should be slightly shorter than the carbon rod. Then drill a hole in the metal sheet and connect a copper wire to it.</p>
<p>Fourth step: Place the carbon rod bag in the bottle and put the metal sheet next to the bag. The carbon rod is the positive terminal and the metal sheet is the negative terminal when in use. In this way, the battery is successful.</p>
<p>Small Experiences</p>
<h3>Universal Soldering Iron</h3>
<p>—Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Ordinary soldering irons are usually at right angles to the handle. This type of soldering iron is not difficult to use in simple structures and spacious places, but it is often difficult to maneuver freely in complex structures and narrow places.</p>
<p>The soldering iron tip should be three inches long, three-quarters of an inch wide, and one-quarter of an inch thick (too large will not conduct heat easily, and too small will not retain heat easily). Use screws and nuts to tightly clamp it to the iron pillar. When using, the soldering iron can be rotated in various directions to suit different applications.</p>
<h3>Improvement of Variable Capacitors</h3>
<p>—Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>A variable capacitor only needs to be able to rotate 180 degrees to be sufficient for use. Too much rotation is inconvenient. Good variable capacitors are designed to stop at the maximum and minimum capacitance positions, but cheaper ones do not have this feature. If you put a rubber band on the frame of an ordinary variable capacitor, you can achieve the same purpose.</p>

<h3>Advice to Women</h3>
<p>— Shěn Yán</p>
<p>Women! You darlings of the age! You want freedom, and freedom is already in your grasp. Not to mention your parents and brothers, but can even your spouses still bind you? Yet we hear decrees becoming ever stricter, and still hear of women who fear their husbands! You want equality, and you’ve leaped far beyond it. You go out, and your husbands wait on you from behind, holding your coats, carrying your things. As long as you command at will, they have no choice but to obediently follow you.</p>
<p>Not only are husbands like this, but other men, seeing you, often treat you even better and more respectfully than they treat your husbands. If things continue this way, there will come a day when men will turn around and loudly proclaim the slogan of equality.</p>
<p>Moreover, women's professions are developing at an alarming rate. It's ten thousand times easier for you to find a position than it is for men. Just look at the "Responses to Self-Employment Introductions" published in the supplement to this newspaper—nine out of ten are addressed to "Ms. So-and-so." It's rare to see one addressed to "Mr. So-and-so." It could be considered a miracle. As for those beautiful young women, it's even better. Even if they don't understand English or Chinese at all, someone will offer a high price to have them sit there for a few hours each day, without having to worry about anything. They can arrive late or leave early, as they please. This makes those who raise three or four sons at home complain and sigh all day long.</p>
<p>It is lamentable that while the apparent progress is so astonishing, the internal collapse is intensifying. Your lives and happiness are even less secure than in the era of expanded old morality. Just look: How many news stories about women killing each other are published in the newspapers every day? The most prominent examples are the case of Wang Wenshu of Guangdong cutting Chen Yuanzhen and the marital breakdown of a certain artist in Shandong. Both vividly demonstrate the mutual jealousy and exclusion among women. Knowing full well that the man already has a wife, they still selfishly associate with him, with the aim of stealing someone else's love. Thus, murder, abandonment, suicide, ┆┆ one tragic scene after another, is constantly being staged.</p>
<p>Therefore, I firmly believe that women, in addition to loudly proclaiming the slogans of freedom and equality, must pay attention to two things at the same time:</p>
<p>(1) Don't value material enjoyment too much;</p>
<p>(2) Have a most sincere sense of sympathy with other women.</p>
<p>Women! You darlings of the age! Do you want to enjoy true happiness? This is a lifeline I offer you! Grab it!</p>
<h3>Ode to the Taiping Public Ritual</h3>
<p>— Huǒ Xuěmíng</p>
<p>The season has transferred from the sweltering summer to the crisp autumn. Along with the autumn wind come scenes of significant change, most notably in the attire of the upper-class Chinese. As usual, the number of laborers sleeping in the narrow city streets at night has also decreased.</p>
<p>At the same time, the vertebrate inhabitants of the impoverished areas, as they escape the inferno and gain some circulating air in this cool early autumn, generously and eagerly save the money they would have spent on spirits to invite Taoist priests to chant scriptures and burn large quantities of silver foil, saying it can ward off disasters, bring blessings, and pray for peace. How lovely, this naive faith of the common people!</p>
<p>What person, in this turbulent and wandering era, feels that the world is at peace? Yet the illusory notion of hoping for peace occupies every mind with such intensity. For example, after the floods of the year before last, followed by the September 18th Incident, government officials in Nanjing, Beiping, Hunan, and Jiangsu built altars everywhere. Some invited living Buddhas, some invited monks, and some invited Taoist priests. They all unanimously prayed for peace and held grand public rituals. Perhaps the success of the Tanggu Truce relied on these merits. However, the bloodied corpses along the Great Wall ultimately fertilized the grass mounds of this summer. The toes of the goddess of peace still tread on the unknowable clouds, smiling foolishly at the human world. Did not the floodwaters of the Yellow River surge into eastern Shandong, destroying the iron bridge? How strange and frightening!</p>
<p>I vaguely remember two years ago when the local authorities banned the Ullambana Festival. The reason given was "strictly prohibiting superstition and saving the people's resources." But the people's stubbornness is an incurable bad habit. Official pronouncements, even if "repeatedly ordered and emphasized," are ignored after a long time, and disregarding the law is not considered a big deal. So why be surprised that these days, under the eaves of streets and alleys, there is a dense, crisscrossing array of strings of long ingots and human figures cut from colored paper, accompanied by the din of gongs and drums and the curling smoke of incense?</p>
<p>Following this, perhaps the Vajra Dharma Assembly and President Dai's promoted "Prayer Meeting" will also arise in response to the times, "cooperating with the people." This is truly an extremely peaceful year!</p>

<h3>The Taste of Sesame Cake</h3>
<p>— Yán</p>
<p>One summer three years ago, a friend asked me to teach his two sons a few basic Chinese characters in his place, but since I made it clear beforehand that I would not accept any money, he forced me to have dinner at his home as a form of compensation. For the first week, everything went smoothly, but from the eighth evening onward, he forced me every day to go to Sullivan, McRae, Le Sang, and other large restaurants frequented by the upper-class Chinese, to eat a full course of Western food. For five days straight, it was bread, soda water, butter, and lettuce, which made my stomach churn and my spirits flag. I argued with him rationally and threatened to quit teaching, so he finally allowed me to eat Chinese food at his home.</p>
<p>Three or four months later, the situation changed drastically. Because I had moved from Shanghai, which was as bustling as the Grand View Garden, to a small county in northern Jiangsu, which was as desolate as a desert. There, not only was there no bread, butter, or soda water, but even ordinary Chinese food was very simple. In the morning, we were forbidden to eat porridge. Ordinary people used large meat noodles instead. I tried it once, but couldn't stand it. Later, I saw several servants there eating sesame cakes, the cakes covered in golden sesame seeds, smelling quite fragrant. I asked the price, only two copper coins. I immediately sent a servant to buy two to try. Once I tried them, I couldn't put them down. It turned out that these sesame cakes, when fresh out of the oven, were even softer than Sullivan's bread, and their sweet and delicious taste was incomparable to any kind of expensive cream cake. In addition, because the baker's technique varied during the kneading process and the oven bricks were uneven, the bottom of the cake often had many horizontal and vertical lines. Some looked like cursive script, others like modern cartoons. You could chew and appreciate them at the same time. How could they not be full of fun and irresistible? I don't believe it.</p>
<p>Although I only spent a little more than three months there, my sesame cake consumption increased from two at a time to three, and then from three to four. And by the last month, I often stroked them repeatedly, reluctant to take a bite for a long time. Even after eating them all, I had to pour all the sesame seeds that had fallen off each cake into my mouth, chewing them carefully, until I had eaten every last one from my sleeves before stopping.</p>
<p>Now, although I have long since returned to Shanghai from northern Jiangsu, I still eat three or four sesame cakes for breakfast every day, and have never changed. The only difference is that these sesame cakes sell for two copper coins in northern Jiangsu and three copper coins in Shanghai. If someone thinks sesame cakes are not very clean, they can go to the sesame cake stand and see for themselves, and use their hand to test the heat of the cake oven. Then they can believe that there is absolutely no foothold for any kind of microbe on the sesame cake.</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhāng Hènshuǐ</p>
<p>Chapter 14: Jiang faces difficulties, hesitates with worries, invites friends for a small gathering, and reluctantly recounts past events.</p>
<p>Ms. Jiang came out again, sighed with a smile, and said, "Alas! You don't know! Last night, my mother and I had a disagreement. I said one thing, and she completely ignored it. Today, she's sabotaging me." Guan Yaowu laughed and said, "In that case, your cousin wants you to be more involved." "That's great, I've managed to drink my bowl of wax gourd soup." He opened his mouth wide and laughed for a while. Ms. Jiang laughed and said, "Then you can rest assured. Let me give you a pot of good tea, and we can talk slowly." Guan Yaowu shook his hand and said, "No, I'll bother you another day. I have to hurry back to the camp." Ms. Jiang said, "Old Master Zhao said that company commanders are much freer than soldiers. How come you're so busy?" Guan Yaowu said, "In the military camp, no matter what, the company commander has the most responsibility. Take this inspection, for example. The headquarters inspects one company after another. The division commander tells the two brigade commanders, each brigade commander tells three regimental commanders, each regimental commander tells three battalion commanders, and each battalion commander tells three company commanders. They just have to wait for the inspection committee to arrive. The company commander has to be busy inside and out for a while. As soon as the notice of inspection arrives, sweeping the floor and pasting the windows, needless to say. A week in advance, the latrine is under strict surveillance, sprinkled with foul water and covered with lime. The wallpaper on the company headquarters walls has to be plastered first by a mason. For example, I love face so much that I cover all the soldiers' bedding with white sheets, even though the money comes from the soldiers, I have to pay it out of my own pocket first. This time, I've made a big hole again, paying out over a hundred dollars. This inspection isn't a one-day affair, it takes a whole week. These days, the inspection committee arrives at one thirty, and that's when we can catch our breath. Once the time is taken, you can forget about leaving that day. They're coming a little later today, so I took the time to make a trip here. Fortunately, it'll be over by tomorrow. I'm an impatient person, and I'm afraid there might be some obstacles to this marriage, so no matter how busy I am, I make the time to run here." (169)</p>

<h3>Financial Gold Prices Recover to $4.90</h3>

After the opening, a Reuters report stated that the U.S. Federal Reserve had the authority to purchase $300 billion of government bonds and that the government would issue mobilization orders to aid in a recovery plan to popularize work and increase wages. Many said this move contained a moderate degree of inflation. Sentiment was shocked, and the market immediately broke through $30. Later, as banks maintained a good appetite, the exchange market tightened, sentiment improved, and the market recovered well. Although banks later sold off, the process was quite tight, and sentiment remained firm, nearly approaching $40. However, foreign telegrams again stated that the U.S. government was expanding credit lending to allow prices to rise with the recovery of industry, commerce, and agriculture, and that it would buy back public bonds, causing the market to decline again. It was observed that the market rose and fell in one day, resulting in a recovery. Banks were diligent in settling accounts, and sentiment was stable. The scarlet price was increased by $215.

After the opening, due to unfavorable news, the market hardened slightly, but banks took advantage of the low prices to buy vigorously, and their appetite was excellent. The market gradually tightened. HSBC quoted the British pound at par and the U.S. dollar up 1.25. After the announcement, the market was very stable. The market loosened slightly at one point, but remained tight at noon. Banks sold off later, but the rising gold market caused the situation to tighten slightly. Trading was not heavy. The closing price for near-term sales was one shilling two pence 4375 and 28.4375 yuan for U.S. exchange, a slight tightening of 0.0625 for British exchange and par for the U.S. dollar compared to the previous close. Banks and foreign firms settled accounts. The front market continued to flood in, and the back market was quiet. Banks initially bought in, then sold off, generally selling off near-term and buying far-term. The gold industry did the opposite. Spot transactions were extremely quiet.

<h3>Foreign Interbank Lending Rate Recovers to Old Price of 6 Points</h3>
<p>With rural areas in decline and the people's economic power exhausted, various commercial sectors have no possibility of development. The situation in the banking industry is undoubtedly bleak. Yesterday, the foreign interbank lending market recovered slightly by one point from the previous day, calculated at six points, while the discount rate remained flat, indicating extreme exhaustion. Interbank lending transactions totaled over 5.51 million in the morning, with new transactions totaling over 1.22 million, and 440,000 in the afternoon. Transactions in the small clearinghouse totaled 770,000. Bank collections: foreign banks collected 1.45 million silver dollars and 1.89 million foreign dollars for ticket payments, and 2.78 million silver dollars and 4.3 million foreign dollars for various commodity exchange collateral and miscellaneous payments. 2.1 million silver dollars were collected for special items. 400,000 silver dollars and 500,000 foreign dollars were withdrawn from warehouses.

<h3>Jiangnan and Guangdong Coins Consistently Stable</h3>

Transactions amounted to 75,000 jiao in the morning and 20,000 jiao in the afternoon. Copper coins remained unchanged at 316,000 cash.</p>
<h3>Securities and Public Bonds Show Slight Signs of Being Squeezed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of the Chinese Securities Exchange remained weak, and the situation was slightly squeezed, but not as intensely as the squeeze in late months past. Since contract 46 was heavily sold in the middle of the month, the market price has been unable to recover. Because the large short positions are not covered, the long positions are overcrowded, so the market price has been weak in recent days, and this is the fundamental reason that contract 46 has sold large amounts without covering. However, the number of short positions in September is still substantial, and there will be major disturbances in the future. We will observe them later. In the morning, long position swaps exceeded short position swaps, and trading among the gangs was considered lively, fluctuating by a small 1 jiao to 2.5 jiao. Only 096 still had takers. The forward price alone rose by 2.5 jiao. After the afternoon opening, long position swaps continued incessantly. The market price was nearly low and far high, differing by 1 jiao to 2 jiao, and 96 for this month also rose by 2.5 jiao. The closing was slightly short covering, and 4 was purchased relatively frequently. The market price rose slightly by about 1 jiao, 96 rose by 2.5 jiao, and contract 6 still had longs being squeezed, with the market price of this month decreasing by 2 jiao. The market price results, except for 96, which rose by 4.5 jiao, and gold shorts, which rose by 1-2 jiao, the rest still fell by 0.5 to 3 jiao. Only one day remains for this month, and it is expected that there will not be much change. The total trading volume was 9.4 million, of which 5,000 was in spot goods and 96 still accounted for the majority, alone accounting for 2.12 million. Unified salt tax totaled 2.59 million, demobilization totaled 930,000, 19 customs duties totaled 965,000, and 20 customs duties totaled 1.445 million, the remainder ranging from several tens of thousands to two to three hundred thousand.</p>
<h3>U.S. Gold Mining Stocks Surge Especially Strong</h3>
<p>New Feng Trading Company reported that on Thursday (the 24th), the New York stock market was dull but firm. The stocks rose slightly by several jiao to one yuan. However, gold mining stocks surged particularly strongly due to the weak U.S. exchange rate and the strength of commodities. The total volume traded for the day was 1.73 million shares. Although the wheat news was good, there was a lack of buyers and leaders, falling by over two points. Spot goods are concentrated on winter and spring wheat, which will reach an extreme. It is still possible to buy when the market reverses. Cotton was flat. The afternoon rise was due to government purchases, but there was no follow-through. Also, the broker's loan was announced yesterday to be 918,000,000 yuan, a decrease of 41,000,000 yuan from the previous week. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Change from Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 101.41 Up 1.01</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 51.09 Up 0.58</p>
<p>20 Public Utility Stocks 30.23 Up 0.18</p>
<p>40 Bonds 87.68 Down 0.10</p>
<h3>Slightly Scalped Yarn and Flower Mark Yarn by Manufacturers</h3>
<p>The yarn market has turned sluggish, and a downward trend has reappeared. Overseas cotton markets are lackluster, and although there is some activity in immediate yarn demand, there is no strong buying power. Moreover, prices for all goods are generally weak, causing people to lose confidence. Many are eager to sell at the slightest rise. Mills are still trying to maintain prices, but some manufacturers are resorting to speculative selling. Currently, the market remains stuck in a fluctuating pattern.</p>
<p>(Low Bidding for Flower Marked Yarn) In the pre-market bidding session, market sentiment was flat, and the foreign cotton market was calm. There were few buyers, and prices for all months fell by 30 cents. One mill engaged in speculative selling, exacerbating the downward trend during the afternoon session. As a result, prices for all months fell by 70 to 90 cents to $1.23. The afternoon market was quiet with a rise of 10 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 27,500 bales. Of these, Ruida sold 3,150 bales, Yiyu 950 bales, Chong'an 1,900 bales, and Xincheng 600 bales. Buyers included Yuanda 1,450 bales, Yichang 1,600 bales, Changfeng 850 bales, and Xiesheng 650 bales. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Prices of Flower Marked Yarn, Rise/Fall, Account Balance:</p>
<p>November 18.3 (down) 1,058,600</p>
<p>August 18.07 (down 6) 17,300 December 18.80 (down 14) 44,300</p>
<p>September 18.43 851,000 January 18.92 (down 12) 47,600</p>
<p>October 18.59 266,000 Total 284,800</p>
<p>(Ordinary Sales of Immediate Yarn) Immediate yarn sales were flat. Total purchases by various groups for the day were 630 bales, with prices down 25 to 50 cents. Purchase amounts by each group were as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha 20, Inland 60, Northern Group 20, Hankou 10, Peers 5</p>
<p>Guangdong 240, Yunnan 220, Ningbo 10, Shantou 40, Zhenjiang 5</p>
<p>Speculative Short Covering in Old Cotton Reaches a Peak</p>
<h3>丨New Cotton Supply Abundant, Market Remains Weak丨</h3>
<p>Eighth-period old cotton reached a new peak of $49.20 due to aggressive short covering. Retail investors, lacking inventory, covered their positions. However, the new cotton market remains weak, with plentiful supply. The only exception is Yao cotton from Ningbo, where dry weather has led to short covering in Shanghai, making the market firmer. Mills are hesitant to purchase new cotton due to the poor yarn market, adopting a wait-and-see approach to raw materials.</p>
<p>(August Contracts Up 95 Cents) In the pre-market Zheng cotton session, this month's contract rose 35 cents due to short covering, while forward contracts lacked buyers and fell 30 cents. In the afternoon, this month's contract rose 60 cents, while other months were flat or down 5 cents. Total transaction volume for the day was 70,100 dan. Sellers included Changhe 3,700 dan, Xincheng 1,700 dan, Deji 15 dan, Changfeng 1,200 dan, Suilong 1,900 dan, and Taixing 1,300 dan. Buyers included Yuanda 3,700 dan, Mingde 3,300 dan, Changfeng 3,400 dan, Dachang 4,000 dan, and Renfeng 2,000 dan. Closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Closing Prices of Zheng Cotton, Rise/Fall, Account Balance:</p>
<p>December 41.75 (down 20) 122,500 August 49.20 (up 9) 486,400 January 41.75 40 106,100</p>
<p>October 41.95 (down 35) 170,500 Total 655,300</p>

<h3>Flour Market Short Covering by Mills After Bidding</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning, after the opening of the flour market, prices for all months showed signs of weakness. Foreign wheat quotations indicated declines of approximately 70 to 80 cents in Chicago and 10 to 20 cents in Canada. Although market sentiment appeared soft after the opening, this month's contract saw a slight rebound of 20 cents, and forward months also recovered slightly by about 1 cent from the previous day. However, with actual sales showing some transactions, market sentiment stabilized. In the afternoon session, mills engaged in short covering, and new positions were rarely opened. Buying groups also made slight purchases, causing long positions to increase and market sentiment to improve. According to industry insiders, this rebound does little to alleviate the current backlog. As a result, this month's contract improved by 7.5 cents, September and October by 1 cent, and November to January by 5 cents.</p>
<p>Wheat Futures Plummet by 5 to 6 Cents</p>
<h3>丨Large Quantities of Foreign Wheat Awaiting Release丨</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw a general decline. Foreign wheat quotations indicated declines of 70 to 80 cents in Chicago and 10 to 20 cents in Canada. This immediately caused instability in market sentiment. With the delivery of this month's contracts approaching, qualified inventory was initially estimated at over 100 carloads. It is reported that after mills have processed their allocations, approximately 60 to 70 carloads remain. Long speculators, aware of the sluggish flour sales and weak wheat market, are gradually liquidating their positions, leading to a significant reduction in forward month positions. In addition, aside from the 9,000 bags already sold, approximately 100,000 bags of foreign wheat are reportedly awaiting release, contributing to the prevailing weak sentiment. As a result, this month's and September contracts fell by 6 cents from the previous day, October by 5 cents, November by 4 cents, and January by 1 cent. Spot wheat prices plummeted, and mill appetite declined again. Only 700 bags of Ming Guang wheat were traded at $3.84, it was said.</p>
<h3>Thin Rice Market in a Stalemate</h3>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday's supply came from over thirty firms. Both retail and wholesale appetite remained unchanged. However, the Nanyang group showed some interest, with the North and South Nanyang groups jointly purchasing over 1,000 bags of thin rice. With supply and demand in equilibrium, market conditions were stable, although the trend was not as strong as in the previous market. As a result, prices for thick japonica rice, such as Changbang, Su Tongbang, and Nangang, and for Du Yang pointed rice, remained largely unchanged. For Qingjiao, Songsi, and Xilian thin rice, the selling and buying sides have reached a stalemate, with price fluctuations around a few cents. Lack of inventory has caused prices for Biànyuán to increase. New millers are neither gaining nor losing.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, the supply from various routes downstream of the river came from twenty-three firms. Market appetite for various types was sluggish, with the market for white japonica rice showing a slight decline. Prices for thin japonica rice and new and old guest pointed rice, and Du pointed rice, have stabilized. Yang pointed, white yuan, and ling white pointed have been slightly discounted by a few cents.</p>
<p>Hunan New Machine Rice Surges by 60 Cents</p>
<h3>Newly Arrived Three Ships Competed For and Bought Out by Local Buyers</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the rice market was very good. The previously mentioned Hunan new rice en route arrived in Shanghai in separate batches yesterday, including 350 bags of Machine Jingxin and 409 bags of Jingxin goods. After arriving on the market, each customer group and local buyers competed fiercely, raising prices to buy. Although it was agreed that the four local customer groups would distribute it equally, market prices had already been driven up, with prices $0.35 higher than the opening prices the previous day, and unpolished rice higher by $0.25 - $0.30. However, comparatively speaking, new machine Jingxin was more than $0.50 or $0.60 more expensive. Because when it first arrived a few days ago it had been $0.20 or $0.30 cheaper, the Machine Jingxin that sold for $6.80 yesterday was exactly the same kind of goods that sold for $6.20 a few days ago. There were only fifty bags because incoming suppliers intended to raise prices to attract supplies. Each group's appetite was greedy. In addition to the local area, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Wenzhou all came. Machine Jingxin initially opened at $6.75, later rising to $6.85.</p>
<p>Unpolished rice initially opened at $5.40, rising to $5.50. The Ningbo group did not come, and instead purchased 60 bags of Jiangxi machine late-season Zhongguan old rice for $7.30. The Quanzhou group also purchased 180 bags of Nanjing Che Xian for $5.50, Beijing Xian followed higher with 30 cents, and machine late-season also looks fairly firm.</p>
<p>First Batch of New Unpolished Rice From North Jiangsu Arrives in Shanghai</p>
<h3>Quality is 7% Higher Than in Previous Years</h3>
<p>New rice from Anhui Province and various routes near Nanjing has already entered the market. Shanghai rice mills have their own purchased rice arriving in Shanghai, milled into white rice for sale, but it has not yet been sold on the market. Yesterday, a consignment of the first batch of new unpolished rice from North Jiangsu, totaling sixty-seven bags, was released on the market by brokers and purchased by the Fuzhou group at a high price. According to the market, it was only about $5.00, but yesterday it opened at $5.30. This year, the new rice harvest everywhere is good, averaging more than 80%, and the quality is also high. The North Jiangsu rice that arrived yesterday was particularly good, and its weight was 7% heavier than in previous years.</p>
<h3>New Soybeans Arrive, Sales Brisk</h3>
<p>There are three to four thousand bags of various new soybeans arriving daily, and sales are still smooth. The local Ningbo, Xiamen, and Guangdong groups are all inquiring, with the Guangdong group being particularly active. Market prices continue to tighten by $0.03 or $0.04. Yesterday, a total of fourteen cars of Changzhou cowhide yellow soybeans opened, priced at $5.10 to $5.05. 1,500 to 1,600 bags of Jiujiang Chenggmen beans opened, priced at $4.47 to $0.43. Over 300 bags of Jiangqiao beans opened, priced at $4.55 to $4.50. Over 290 bags of Hankou Jinpi early yellow soybeans opened, priced at $4.90 to $4.70. 270 bags of early yellow soybeans opened, priced at $4.30 to $0.10. 234 bags of June white soybeans opened, priced at $4.85, it was said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Hainan Red Sugar Surges by 40 Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market continued to tighten as the customs gold rate rose. The guild set the rate for No. 24 raw sugar and ordinary white sugar at $0.05 higher, with 500 to 600 bags traded at $21.08. Transshipment goods opened at 7.95 Dutch guilders, up $0.03 from the previous day. No. 20 medium white sugar rose by $0.01, to $20.60. Dutch Red PK Mark remained at $16.80. Taikoo Sugar B Mark rose by $0.05, to $21.50, CW Mark fell by a little, to $21.35, DY Mark rose by $0.15, to $21.00, and HX Mark rose by $0.10, to $20.50. The price of domestic Hainan red sugar surged by $0.40 again, with 108 bags sold by Xu Shengji for $15.70. The newly arrived Chaozhou Qing Jiao,提莊, rose to $16.00. Various firms observed and did not move forward, in a stalemate. Over 200 bags of cottonseed red sugar opened, with a high price of $17.42 and $17.05, and a secondary price of $16.84. Chunghua and Guohua cottonseed white each moved up $0.05, top quality at $20.35, No. 1 at $20.15, No. 2 at $19.95, No. 3 at $19.75, and No. 4 at $19.55. Local brown sugar prices remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Northern and Southern Goods, Chaozhou 曲, Sales Activity</h3>
<p>Chaozhou red noodles, which had been sluggish in sales previously and had not been offered for a long time, have recently seen increasing activity in the market. No. 1 goods have been offered for sale every day, with top grade at $32.50 and ordinary at $20.00. Inventories are gradually thinning, showing a tight market.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Hangzhou Silkworm Cocoon Firms Preparing to Open</h3>
<p>The Genshanmen cocoon firms are exchanging cocoon slips for Hangzhou, Lin'an, and other places. The autumn cocoons are large and clustered, and the new cocoons will soon be on the market. Cocoon firms around Genshanmen are now exchanging cocoon slips in preparation for opening to receive cocoons.</p>
<p>Artificial Silk Sales Increasingly Difficult, Foreign Exchange Increases. Artificial silk sales are becoming increasingly difficult. Yesterday, only Shanghai silk merchants purchased 20 boxes of Feima and Double Deer brands for immediate and forward delivery, priced at $174.00 or $175.00 net.</p>
<p>Yellow and White Factory Silk Short Covering Sparse. New York market: Immediate silk factory purchases remain weak, future silk is ignored, and silk cables are not transferred. Both Chinese and foreign parties in Shanghai are taking a wait-and-see attitude. Yesterday, only a French company slightly covered its short positions, with Le Na and others purchasing 20 bales of white factory silk and 10 bales of yellow factory silk. Prices remained stable.</p>
<h3>Drawn-Core Precious Eyebrow Tea Transactions Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign tea market of the port, Wuyuan high-grade drawn-core precious eyebrow green tea, sold by Baochang, Yongxing, Tongfu, Jinjiang, and various foreign firms and Chinese tea companies, were being purchased due to overseas telegram demands. Trade was very active, with selling prices around $200, unchanged from before. However, ordinary precious eyebrow tea from Tunxi and Xiuning, was still not being traded much. However, with low tea prices and strong overseas sales, the market is brewing for development. The market for other needle eyebrow and pearl tea items are trending stable.</p>
<h3>Hardware, Black Sheet Iron Sales Plummet</h3>
<p>No. 31 black sheet iron is a popular autumn product among northern gangs, with substantial annual sales. However, with the Northeast four provinces occupied, the outlet has been drastically reduced, and there is no appetite in Tianjin, Beiping, Zhangjiakou, and other places. Qingdao, Yantai, and other gangs are all adopting a wait-and-see approach, so the market is weak. Prices are gradually declining, with each carrier opening at $11.60, a few dimes lower than before. Business at local enamel factories has not improved recently, resulting in no appetite for purchasing black sheet iron. As a result, the market will not easily recover.</p>

<h3>Various Donated Ranks</h3>
<p>— Luo Wen</p>
<p>In the middle of the Qing dynasty, one could donate to become an official, and those who did so were called "donated ranks." The sons of rich people ate until their faces were shiny and then, after a few days of busyness, would have a small crystal bead on their heads and sometimes a blue feather, speaking official language, saying "The weather is nice today."</p>
<p>By the Republic, it was said that there were no more donated ranks, but in reality, the path of donation actually developed, and even "scholar-literati" could obtain official hats through this. The first chapter of the opening statement is naturally money. As long as you have money, everything is easy. For example, to donate to become a scholar, one could buy a batch of antiques, make friends with some scholars, and hire some workers to rub the patterns and words on the antiques, printing them into a book with glass plates. It would be called "A Collection of Ancient Records" or "An Archeological Record." Li Fusun made a "Record of Epigraphy," which was dedicated to recording people who studied epigraphy, but this became a precedent, allowing scholars to continue it again and again, and even extending it to including young masters and merchants who collected and sold antiques, all grouped together, which was called "epigraphers."</p>
<p>Donating to become a "writer" also doesn't require new tricks. Just open a bookstore, pull in a few writers, hire some helpers, publish a small newspaper, and saying "The weather is nice today" is also necessary. Write it, print it, hand it over to news vendors, and in less than a year or two, success is guaranteed. However, the rubbings of antique patterns and words cannot be used anymore; they should be replaced with photos of movie stars and modern women, because this is the art of the new era. There are still many people who "love beauty" in China, and "writers" or "artists" arise in this way.</p>
<p>Donating to become an official allows one to hope to fleece the people, but donating to become a scholar or writer does not necessarily result in a loss. Printed materials can be sold for cash, and antiques will eventually have foreign devils willing to pay a high price.</p>
<p>This is also called "gaining both fame and fortune." However, one must first be able to "invest," so ordinary people cannot do it. Otherwise, scholars and literati would not be worth much.</p>
<p>But they are still worth something now, so there will still be people busy making biographical dictionaries, creating literary histories, publishing writer reviews, and compiling autobiographies. I think that if historical works are written, they should divide writers into Romantic, Classical, and another "Donated Rank" school. History must be "true," and bearing some resentment is something one has to endure. Isn't that right?</p>
<h3>Two Plus Two Equals Five Minus One</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>This year, I wrote a few things and many friends warned me that the satirical tone was too strong. This is naturally well-intentioned.</p>
<p>I don't have any thorns in my stomach, so I won't prick anyone without rhyme or reason! However, since I was born in this era, I cannot stand idly by, and everything I cannot swallow must be spat out.</p>
<p>Originally, I wanted to raise my head and speak a few honest words, but reality makes it impossible. In this day and age, if you insist on saying "two plus two equals four," it is out of step with the times. If you want me to follow others and say "two plus two equals five," I can't do that either. So, I can only say: "Two plus two equals five minus one."</p>
<p>This is why I have some satirical overtones. From this, it can be seen that the reason I prick, the reason I say "two plus two equals five minus one," is not intentional. I never want to show off my small cleverness, but I eagerly hope that my views and those of others who share them will "return to heaven" sooner, so that "the rest of China will be unified properly."</p>
<p>But it must not be "two plus two equals five."</p>
<p>Nowadays, "two plus two equals five" is very popular in society. Because it is popular, not only does everyone not feel it is wrong, but it seems to be somewhat right. Since "two plus two equals five" is right, then "two plus two equals four" must be wrong.</p>
<p>Therefore, "two plus two equals four" is nonsense, it is troublemaking, and it is all undesirable!</p>
<p>I once heard that someone was caught and tortured because they didn't have money to bribe corrupt officials. This person didn't scold the corrupt officials for corruption, but quietly blamed himself for being too poor. Saying "two plus two equals five minus one" has this kind of flavor. Although it is still inevitable to be a heretic, there is no direct act of hostility. Even if it's a prick, it can still be tolerated in order to save face.</p>
<p>Moreover, even when it is unbearable, because what goes is a prick, what is returned is also a prick. Although this prick is already a gun or knife prick that can result in death, it is still inevitable to be a prick. After all, one cannot raise the Green Dragon Crescent Blade, bright and clear, and shout "Kill!" in a loud voice.</p>
<p>Because of these advantages, when I am not allowed to say "two plus two equals four" and I am unwilling to say "two plus two equals five," I can only say: "two plus two equals five minus one."</p>
<h3>Western Wind Temple</h3>
<p>— Kang De</p>
<p>I went to Puzhen to see Xian, who had just recovered from a long illness, but because the autumn scenery of the countryside was attractive, I stayed without waiting for him to persuade me.</p>
<p>The autumn scenery of the countryside is really attractive: the blue and clear sky untouched by wisps of clouds, the clear river water with a visible bottom, the trees like bald old men, the red leaves scattered on the ground, as melancholy and beautiful as newly dressed young women... When we walked in the fields in the morning sun, we often dispelled the worries in our hearts and felt the joy of life. Not only the autumn scenery of the countryside is attractive, but also Xian's family, enveloped in an atmosphere of warmth, made me, who had left home when I was young and wandered for many years, feel that I could settle down and be reluctant to leave. His mother, whose hair had turned white, was so kind, and his young sister was so gentle and docile. I thought: Let's settle down here and no longer live lonely in the remote alleys of the city. However, this was just a dream. After three days, I once again broke the strong retention of his whole family and returned to X City without saying a word!</p>
<p>That was the afternoon of the third day. Xian and I were sitting idly in the abandoned garden behind the house. At that time, the faint autumn sun was weakly shining on us, the small birds were chirping among the withered pumpkin vines, and a few chrysanthemum branches about to wither trembled and nodded a few times in the breeze. Suddenly, his old mother also came in, to tidy up the mustard greens drying in the garden.</p>
<p>"Young Master Kang," he suddenly said to me after tidying up the mustard greens. "How old is your mother?"</p>
<p>This sentence stunned me. Having been away from home for eight years, I had even forgotten my mother's age. After thinking for a moment, I replied to her: "I only remember she was born in the Year of the Ox."</p>
<p>"She's fifty-two this year," he calculated and said for me.</p>
<p>Then she asked: "Does she look as old as me?"</p>
<p>"Mother, you really know how to ask," Xian interjected, "He hasn't been home for eight years, how would he know how old she looks."</p>
<p>"He hasn't been home for eight years?" she exclaimed. "Young Master Kang, does your family have many siblings?"</p>
<p>I was already somewhat sad, and reluctantly replied: "I don't have any brothers or sisters."</p>
<p>"Then you're truly a precious son!" After she finished speaking, she suddenly stared at me in silence, with a smile on her face. I thought,</p>
<p>"Oh! You may be sick, but my mother and I..."</p>
<p>The homesickness that had been suppressed in my heart for a long time burst out. That day's dinner consisted of only a little, and I no longer chatted with Xian under the lamp for a while as usual, and went upstairs to bed alone.</p>
<p>Crying silently under the covers, the kind and affectionate conversations of Xian's mother and children came one after another. Each sentence I heard caused strings of tears to drip down. Ah! Mother, when will I be able to reunite with you and chat warmly together!</p>
<p>The next morning, as I was sorting a stack of draft paper with several thousand words written on it, Xian's mother also got up. She told me that I had been crying miserably in my dreams last night.</p>
<p>That day, I returned to X City in the whistling west wind.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Talks on Mountain Living (Continued)</h3>
<p>— A Ying</p>
<p>㈡ Two Worlds</p>
<p>"The opposition of two worlds," this is what we often hear. These two worlds are the capitalist countries and the socialist countries. What I am talking about here is also "the opposition of two worlds," but this "opposition" is not the story told in "Mr. Wu's Records." In "Mr. Wu's Records," there is a passage that says:</p>
<p>In the Jiaxu year of the Jingtai reign, there was much snow in Wu. On the fifteenth day of the first month, snow accumulated seven or eight feet in one night. Compared to that, the city walls were filled, and the people's residences were crushed. Those on the side overturned, those who were tied to thatched roofs were pierced through, and those with fragile beams were all broken. In the main streets and alleys, those who were stiff and lying down were everywhere. Only twelve or thirteen of them had smoke coming out of their chimneys. The prefect of the county, Zhu Xu, regarded it as an auspicious omen and had snow made into lions, facing each other on the east and west sides of the prefectural office, as tall as they could be. He fitted two huge eyes and made the fur and claws, and used colors to make them. Wang Xiyi raised his eyebrows, and the entire prefectural office and the officials hosted banquets and enjoyed them, lit lamps and markets, arranged for actors to perform plays, and the sound of flutes and drums did not cease until dawn.</p>
<p>Isn't what is recorded here clearly two completely opposite "worlds"? "Behind the vermillion gates, meat and wine go to waste, while on the road lie frozen bodies," this kind of "opposition of two worlds" has existed from ancient times to the present. Even now, there are many "residents" like those mentioned in "Wu's Records," and there are many "Prefect Wangs" like those mentioned in "Wu's Records." After all, the present is the present. These "two worlds" are not as "refined" as in ancient times, and the prefects are even more "evil." Therefore, they are advancing to mutual hand-to-hand combat. Let's see who is the final victor!</p>
<h3>Women (II)</h3>
<p>— Shen Congwen</p>
<p>"The one who picked me up, my name is called 'Forget-Me-Not'."</p>
<p>She bent down and picked it up.</p>
<p>A liver-colored flat face brushed past her shoulder. A Russian soldier's blue eyes seemed to lust after the woman for a moment. She felt insulted and quickly left.</p>
<p>Before long, outside room 317 on the third floor, a slender hand with a gray silk glove lightly tapped on the door. There was no sound inside, but she still gently pushed open the door. Upon opening the door, she saw the patient wearing a white bathrobe, looking out the window with his back to the door. He seemed to be thinking about something, or absorbed in contemplation of some scenery, so he paid no attention to the guest.</p>
<p>She gently closed the door and quietly walked up to the patient, saying softly:</p>
<p>"I've come."</p>
<p>The patient turned his head and smiled.</p>
<p>"I was just wondering why autumn comes so quickly. Look at the willow tree outside the window."</p>
<p>The woman in green seemed to be struck by this, feeling a sting in her heart. She pretended that the patient's words were unrelated to her, smiling gently.</p>
<p>"Think less, autumn has come, it's enough for you to recognize it, there's no need for you to think about it."</p>
<p>"If I don't think about it, can I recognize it?"</p>
<p>The woman then said lightly, with a slightly self-deprecating tone:</p>
<p>"For example, people, some people you recognize don't necessarily need to think about!"</p>
<p>"Sit down, don't say that. That's like Miss Ru's way of talking. Didn't we agree yesterday not to be like that?"</p>
<p>The patient pulled Miss Ru to sit down beside a chair with armrests, then stood in front of her, holding her hands tightly:</p>
<p>"How do you know I wasn't thinking of you?"</p>
<p>The woman's lips parted slightly, revealing two rows of small white teeth. Her beautifully curled hair was slightly tilted, making a face like a little girl often does.</p>
<p>The patient said:</p>
<p>"You're really like a child."</p>
<p>"Am I like a child?"</p>
<p>"You are a child!"</p>
<p>"Then, you are an adult."</p>
<p>"But I'm only twenty-two this year."</p>
<p>"But in some ways, you're really a twenty-two-year-old adult."</p>
<p>"Are you saying I'm worldly?"</p>
<p>"I'm saying I'm not as..."</p>
<p>"Alright." The patient walked over to the window, turned his back to the woman, and frowned slightly. When he turned back, he said, "I want to be discharged from the hospital, but the doctor won't let me go."</p>
<p>The woman said, "What's the rush?" Then she added, "I saw the nurse, she also said that the doctor thinks you still can't leave."</p>
<p>"I'm very restless. I still have a lot of things to do..."</p>
<p>"Are you feeling better? Are you sleeping well?"</p>

<p>Essays</p>
<h3>On Etiquette</h3>
<p>— Lie Huo</p>
<p>"Etiquette" is not an inherent defect, but the abominable abuses that have evolved from a consistent inheritance. I am not a supporter of "national essence," nor am I a blind follower of "foreign goods." I only feel that "national essence" and "foreign goods" are not to be estimated without bias and even grit my teeth and glare, stubbornly defending one side.</p>
<p>Needless to say, "etiquette" is our "national essence." Although it is said to be a national essence, civilized nations like those in Europe and America, and uncivilized ones like the Miao tribes, all have their own "etiquette." However, in our ancient and fragrant country, "etiquette" has been fashionable and productive throughout the ages. Indeed, from the Duke of Zhou to the present, the Chinese nation is probably the most fond of talking about "etiquette" in the world.</p>
<p>Originally, this form of "etiquette" was a product of feudalism. That it can still exist in today's capitalist society, and even be more prevalent, is truly perplexing.</p>
<p>I am not opposed to talking about "etiquette," such as the kind of etiquette lessons written in white chalk on blue tinplate in elementary schools: "Bow to your teacher when you meet him on the road; greet your classmates!" I am very much in favor of this. For example, in general shops in Shanghai, if you are shabbily dressed and follow behind a wealthy young master or lady, wanting to buy something, the shop assistants there will definitely not bother to answer you much, and may even give you a scornful look, arrogant, making you feel uneasy. Such shop assistants who only follow the trend of power and profit and do not understand or practice etiquette are truly wrong. Also, for example, in common apartment buildings, those living in the front building and the back building, in the attic and on the third floor, even though they have lived together for years, are familiar with each other, and always pass each other by without greeting, asking questions, or interacting, and do not care about each other's misfortunes and blessings, are the same as the arrogant and unethical shop assistants, and I consider these equally wrong.</p>
<p>However, the shop assistants in some shops in Peiping treat customers so respectfully that as long as you enter their shop, whether you buy something or not, they will always see you off with courteous respect. This is really too cumbersome, and the hypocrisy makes people feel equally uneasy, and it is also inappropriate.</p>
<p>What is most true is that the excessive emphasis on etiquette among the middle and upper classes of society, with etiquette requiring reciprocity, further undermines the essence of etiquette.</p>
<p>I remember two years ago, at an old classmate's house, during the New Year, he bought a large basket of New Year's cake to give as a gift to a colleague. I asked him why he had to be so cumbersome and wasteful. He said it was because the colleague had already sent him a gift, and he had to reciprocate. This was "etiquette," and even more so, it was reciprocal etiquette. In our opinion, sending New Year's cards during the New Year is enough to express "etiquette." Why be hypocritical, cumbersome, and wasteful, with you coming and going to exchange gifts? As for the upper classes, they send not just New Year's cake, but all kinds of gifts, sending them endlessly.</p>
<p>Because this trend has continued, it means that if you come to see me once today, I must visit you tomorrow when I have nothing to do. If he treats you to dinner yesterday, you must reciprocate in the next few days, extending to all kinds of birthday celebrations, all bustling with reciprocal etiquette. I consider all of these to be wrong as well.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that excessive emphasis on etiquette is close to hypocrisy, while a lack of it is arrogance. Hypocrisy and arrogance are equally extreme and inappropriate. At this point, I must call out the "Doctrine of the Mean," which I am unwilling to call out, which is that etiquette must be in the "middle ground."</p>
<p>To achieve the "middle ground" in etiquette, several points need to be noted:</p>
<p>㈠ It should arise from nature and end in naturalness, without forced or hypocritical efforts.</p>
<p>㈡ There should be no distinction between superior and inferior, noble and lowly, in the exchange of etiquette, only differences between elder and younger, close and distant.</p>
<p>㈢ Etiquette should change with life and evolve with the times, without being bound by established etiquette.</p>
<h3>Bitter Smile</h3>
<p>— Hou Ying</p>
<p>What a beautiful early summer night it is, nature has fully unfolded its true face. The moon gently emits cool light; the stars are brilliantly embedded in the pitch-black sky; the water flows quietly and murmuringly; a gentle breeze blows, and the slender branches dance to greet the moon; the waves lightly ripple, reflecting the shadows of the trees; and there are: birds chirping their clear songs; grasshoppers singing their melodies; everything is immersed in the true essence of the universe, everything is sweet and pleasant; this is a beautiful scene that no poet has ever imagined, a beautiful scene that no novelist can describe. Heaven and earth also seem to be smiling broadly, admiring with joy that there is still such true happiness in the world.</p>
<p>However, the affairs of the world are impermanent. In this clear and quiet sky, a dark cloud suddenly flew over from the horizon; it flew so quickly that, in a moment, it covered this joyful world with darkness. The gentle breeze turned into a violent storm, howling and shaking the trees; thunder rumbled, as if drumming overhead; the ink-like sky flashed clear and white lightning. Although it was not yet raining, the scene was more terrifying than when it rained. The stars and the moon hid inside the dark clouds, perhaps because they could not bear to see this tragic slaughter? The birds' chirping and the grasshoppers' singing all stopped at this time; all that could be heard was a faint moan. In short, everything had changed, how bleak the sky was!</p>
<p>Finally, the heavy rain came down. As big as copper coins, bit by bit, strand by strand, it kept falling in the dim night. The wind, the violent wind, gust after gust, blew, blew, blew! The birds were so frightened that they lay in their nests, and the insects were so terrified that they fled back to their burrows; but what was the use? The violent wind would blow away your nest, and the torrential rain would flood your burrow! Little insects, little birds, where can you escape? The whole world is like this—violent wind, torrential rain, thunder, and lightning—all of these are going to destroy your lives, to destroy your lives unreasonably! Ah! You might as well lie down obediently and quietly submit to slaughter! You cannot escape, and you don't even need to think about escaping, look! In this vast expanse, where is there light? There is no door to heaven, no road to earth, what can you do? Have you ever seen light? Perhaps you have seen it. But the light has now fled away—it is hiding outside this darkness, and you cannot see it! You do not have the courage to break through this darkness, you do not have the perseverance to continue this courage, you will never obtain light, and you will always be slaughtered by others! Fight! Although bloodshed is inevitable, although death is inevitable, the light is just behind that darkness! Alas! Weak little things!</p>
<p>After about an hour, the violent wind subsided, the torrential rain stopped, the thunder weakened, and the lightning died out; the dark clouds also passed. Although it is impossible to say when another scene will suddenly be staged, for the time being, it is quite peaceful. Behind the dark clouds, the stars and the moon revealed their faces, and the bright and cool light was still the same as before; the water, quiet and lively, flowed murmuringly, and was still the same as before. Everything was as before; however, the songs of the little birds and little insects were gone. The grace of the violent wind and torrential rain had killed their companions and destroyed their homes; they only had sorrow, how could they sing merrily again? The gentle breeze blew softly, and the raindrops dripped slowly, and their hearts were filled with great sorrow. Although they are weak—without the courage to resist this rude and unreasonable robber—their sorrow is something that no one can stop. However, rather than saying that they are sorrowful, it is more accurate to say that they can only force a bitter smile. Bitter smile, bitter smile, eternal bitter smile! Bitter smile at themselves, bitter smile at their companions. Alas! The sorrow of the weak!</p>
<h3>Locust Plague (A Short Play)</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Time: An arid afternoon in June 1933</p>
<p>Place: A farm in X Village, X Province. Although it is said to be an arid year, the withering of the crops is not due to drought, but because they have been devoured by locusts. The front and back of the farm present a deathly atmosphere of withered, yellow-brown fields scorched by the sun.</p>
<p>Characters: Old Man Zhang, Li Xiaoqiu (a farmer), Wang Kefa (a school teacher), Hao Ba (a retired soldier)</p>
<p>Old Man Zhang (puts on his straw hat, which he has used for more than ten years, and walks out of the farm gate. Suddenly, he cries "Oh dear!" and retreats, his face showing worry and resentment.) The ground is even...</p>
