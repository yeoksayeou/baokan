<p>時評</p>
<h3>敵渡灤河平津危急</h3>
<p>— 實</p>
<p>日本侵略我東北。其初原持經濟的武器。努力於市場之開發。金融資本支配力之擴大。迄乎近年來。世界經濟恐慌愈甚。各國又均實行保護主義。力圖所謂自給自足。日本帝國主義者。乃假名自衛。肆行破壞我國之獨立。又以「防赤」爲名。眩惑列强。以取得國際同情。若我國在九一八事變當時。即奮力抗戰。縱令失敗。亦不過經國際之調停。提出東北五鐵道爲犧牲品。最大限度。不過讓日人獨占東北交通事業。喪失東北若干經濟上權力。戰敗之失。猶可以自求補救。非然者即取直接交涉之途徑。其失亦不過如此。乃吾國因循於和戰之間。誤認國聯有制止日本之力。到敵人坐大。東北失陷之外。熱河亦被蹂躪。矣蓋日本所。謂大陸政策。乃軍國主義者挽救經濟恐慌之最後法術。殊不知軍事行動愈擴大。則財政愈困難。經濟恐慌愈益深化。於是武力之侵略。亦愈無止境。故其侵襲瀋陽之初。目的只在於東北之經濟上旣得權利。迨遼吉入日人把握之後。而黑龍江錦州榆關相繼不守。地佔五十八萬方里之熱河。亦盡爲敵人掩有。雖我抵抗之聲。高倡入雲。而實力之表現。則甚微細。於是敵愈輕進。一舉而進迫長城。再進而襲占灤東。今且渡灤河而西。越古北口以窺密雲。東迫豐潤。洶洶之勢。直將震撼平津。搖動河北。</p>
<p>我國今日雖民窮財盡。事前又無準備。然而人多地廣。且一般大衆能忍耐勞苦之特性。實駕世界各國而上。所缺少者强有力之指導與公正嚴密之組織耳。設使我國能對日作戰。祇須繼續猛進。不斷苦鬭。縱令因戰敗之故。而失陷一省兩省以至三四省區。亦絕不足慮。一則可以借此振刷我國之頽風。再則可以堅强國内之團結。三則足以奮勵全國之士氣。勝敗固兵家之常。端視最後一戰。最後五分鐘之結算何如。况日本軍國主義者。在時代關係上。爲西山斜照。雖甚美麗。而爲時殊不長久。在事實上彼國内在矛盾。日漸開展。加以戰爭之催迫。其激化必更急劇。是則我縱出巨大犧牲。但以此空前代價。奮其最後之力。從事於民族的廣大長久之鬭爭。吾人終必能闢開光明之途徑。獲得最後之勝算。</p>
<p>就外界形勢而論。各國間糾紛甚多。我國在國際上似不免於孤立。然亦决當掃除依賴性。不能因前途暗淡。即自心灰意懶。不求所以自立。且今日之失敗。即奠將來成功之基。吾人於認識敵人眞面目。努力奮戰之外。尤須激勉全國。振起大衆。昻揚我四萬萬人民奮發自救之精神。痛已往之失敗。圖未來之挽救。我國現有土地。尙不止二千五百萬方里。一切自然力之藴蓄。尙倍於全歐。今雖困於日閥之侵擾。然我大衆苟能眞正覺悟。猶大有可爲。挽此頽勢。亦非不可能之事。願國人積極奮起。拚小我之犧牲。以換取民族永久之生命。</p>

<p>（東京）日外交部乘有田外次辭職、吉田死後土耳其日使缺員之機會、將更動部内重要地位、凡一切重要職務、均由强硬派調任、目前之外交策略、則對歐美取消極政策、而集其全力進攻我國、現在操日外交之實權者、仍爲荒木派下之軍閥、内田·重光·小幡·谷·及白鳥等、不過情願爲荒木派之留聲機而已、日軍部最近之對華策略、簡直就是迫戰求和、聞其具體辦法爲（一）加緊進行侵略華北、使我國内部起分化、以武力封鎖我華北各口岸、一面行强制貿易、補救其國内之經濟恐慌、消滅抵貨風潮、一面則迫我財政經濟陷入不可收拾之地步以此爲要挾、迫我政府簽訂賣身條約、（二）積極挑撥西南將領及政客反對中央、不但欲使中央不能全力應府日軍、且助成我國内戰云、（十六日華聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）内田外相、所以拔擢重光公使、維有田次官之後任者以退出國聯後之日本外交、其重點將置於中國問題之故、如中國方面迄不反省、維持現狀、則華北不安將益增加、東洋和平可爲寒心、故日本爲謀中日關係之一新起見、有積極開始活動之必要、因此内田外相前置小幡大使於外相顧問之地位、並增加亞細亞局人員、充實對華外交、此次復起用重光、蓋使精通中國問題之小幡大使·重光次官·參加於谷亞細亞局長白鳥情報部長之强硬派、而内田外交之對華陣容、至此整備、惟期待今後之活動、（十六日電通社電）</p>

<h3>軍縮臨成敗關頭</h3>
<p>德國形勢又使歐美緊張羅斯福發宣言左右大局</p>
<p>▲路透十五日倫敦電德國新近發展已引起歐美之不寗、法國報紙推測德副總理巴本昨所發表之言論、乃希特勒星期三日在國會發言之先聲、極守舊之法蘭西動作報謂巴本之言、巳將十五年來德國所行之政策、說明之、承認之、並公佈之云、美國對世界經濟會議之信任、巳爲德國趨向戰爭之言論、日内瓦軍縮會之頓挫、但澤巨變之可能性、及希特勒派在奥國之野心所撼動、英國對於德國近事之反動、亦可於泰晤士報之批評見之、其言曰、在要求他國解除軍備之前、最好先蔣希特勒主要目的之一、即準備德國作報復戰爭者、加以非難云、</p>
<p>▲路透十五日華盛頓電羅斯福總統將於星期二日發表甚重要之宣言、說明美國政策、以期運用世界輿論及時抵銷星期三日德總理希特勒在國會中所發言論之影響、美總統希望以其宣言保全軍縮會議、而舖平通至世界經濟會議之途徑、衆料此次宣言將詳言關於歐洲關係之主義、如門羅主義、然並料美總統將聲明美國準備、（一）於遇有戰爭危險時、與他國協商、（二）參加適當保障辦法、（三）主張依照英相麥唐納計畫中所載之範圍實行軍縮、</p>
<p>▲路透十六日柏林電官塲所擬關於德國軍縮事件之文件、今日已公佈、指責他國欲在統一陸軍制之問題上破壞軍縮會議、俾避免與第二點即物質的軍縮接近、並陳述德國平等要求之必要、該文舉他國積極備戰、與德國兵工廠空無一物之事實、互相比較、並以未有讓步遽承認新担負是否得計爲問、德總理希特勒今日覲見興登堡總統、大約與總統討論其明日在國會發表之重要言論、</p>
<p>▲國民十五日日内瓦電此時軍縮會議代表多已考慮展緩一切軍縮討論、以策經濟會議之進步、但若德總理希特勒堅持應許德國重行武裝、恐將有另取他種手續之必要、據數代表言、倘希特勒於星期三國會開會後宣布德國决意武裝其軍隊、（按德國目下在軍力及若干種主要軍械均受限制、故在術語謂之解除武裝）、則料舊日協約國中或將單獨或聯合提出此事於國聯行政院、但另有數代表則信目前僵局仍有展開機會、事勢當不致趨此絕境也、據主要金融國消息、現以軍縮局面之不定、在商業上已發生不良影響、但在星期三德國會開會以前、時局未必有進步之望、希特勒已準備一宣言、詳述德國對於軍縮會問題之態度、將在國會宣讀、請其通過、但其内容是否將勸德國踰越和約之規定、目下尙無表示云、</p>
<h3>美英態度</h3>
<p>▲路透社十五日華盛頓電今日有以德副總理巴本之演說及軍縮會議之情勢請國務卿赫爾詳述者、赫爾家答、僅稱、在事件未達到確切之地步時、當局者遽加討論、實非所宜云、並稱、渠未接得台維斯關於報載英美法三國成立妥協、擬一致勸喻德國勿躁切行動之報告云、</p>
<p>▲路透社十五日倫敦電英外相西門希望親自赴日内瓦、代表英政府參加星期四日之重要會議、因軍縮會議之前途繫於此會也、惟西門政躬不健、如不堪跋踄之勞、則將以陸相海爾珊出席、按海爾珊近曾發採行可能的制裁加諸德國之言、已引起德副總理巴本之激烈答覆、</p>
<p>▲路透社十五日倫敦電據最近消息、外相西門或陸相海爾珊皆不擬於星期三日赴日内瓦、故刻來倫敦之英代表艾登將挾内閣訓令返日内瓦參加星期四日會議、因艾登在日内瓦爲英國代表辦理一切、已獲得内閣之完全信任也、</p>
<p>▲路透社十五日日内瓦電英代表艾登鑒於軍縮會議命運之可慮、今晚已起程返倫敦、以便向英政府報告現狀、艾登即將回日内瓦參加定星期四日舉行之重要討論、</p>
<h3>法美聯絡</h3>
<p>▲哈瓦斯十六日巴黎電據日報載稱、軍縮會議美國代表台維斯昨日與外長彭古會唔時、彭古曾云、德國確已開始重整軍備、各種軍器由凡爾賽條約所禁止者、已公開製造、彭古與台維斯對于此種破壞條約舉動、似已考慮制裁辦法、在未制裁之前、或者共同對德提出抗議、以資警告云、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯十五日巴黎電美國軍縮代表台維斯在外交部與外長彭古會晤一點鐘之久、所談者特别爲軍縮會議於星期四重行工作及世界經濟會議問題、關於經濟會議一層、台維斯僅請法國當局對于法國對關稅休戰之保留加以說明、台維斯因最近德國對軍縮態度所釀成之局勢、曾在倫敦進行談話、力求英美兩國對軍縮問題意見之接近、台維斯將其談話結果報告彭古、台氏又謂、德國對軍縮之要求、使美國大爲憂慮、渠對于希氏將在衆議院發表之演說、急欲一知究竟、渠意英美法三民主國極宜聯合一致、以應付目下之難關、台維斯對此數端、曾爲彭古反覆言之、星期四總委員開會時、大約英法美三國代表必說明各該國政府意見、此項宣言必以台維斯最近在倫敦巴黎談話時所公同决定之原則爲基礎云、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯十五日巴黎電軍縮會議美國代表台維斯與法外長彭古會談之後、出與人言、本日兩人所談者不外三種問題、一爲倫敦世界經濟會議、一爲軍縮會議、一爲一般人所等待之未來事變、關于第一事、渠謂形勢頗爲混亂、關於軍縮會議、則會務業已停頓、至於未來事變、其意係指希特勒對衆議院將發表之演說、台氏又謂、渠定于星期三晚間赴日内瓦、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯十六日日内瓦電小協商各國外交部長舉行會議、對軍縮會議討論情形交換意見、並會商出面干涉方法、各外長又對小協商各國經濟會議擬定程序、</p>
<h3>德國形勢</h3>
<p>▲國民十五日柏林電德總理希特勒已自巴伐利亞返柏林、希氏曾於星期休假日中、擬就星期三在國會中宣讀關於德國國際外交之演說、此次國會召集會議、外國記者多謂社會民主黨份子將一律不出席參加云云、實則此消息不確、彼等非但參加會議、且將加入辯論云、現德國出席軍縮會議之那杜尼大使亦已自日内瓦返德、正擬參加各項重要會議、屆時必有重要之發展云、</p>
<p>▲哈瓦斯十六日柏林電軍縮會議德國首席代表那多尼返國、向政府陳述軍縮會議形勢、定於星期三日希特勒總理在衆議院發表演說之後、立即啓程返日内瓦、</p>
<p>▲路透社十五日柏林電星期杪全國空氣頗形震動、今則各報對於外國政局、巳不若前之關心、殆因希特勒總理將於星期三日在國會演說宣佈德國之政策故也、惟德意志日報今日載有長文、謂戰爭今已不成問題、蓋各國均不能稍有所利、而德國尤有爲法國波蘭集合打擊之虞也、文内又謂英美在經濟上太不合算、必不出此、而法國雖抱有爭權之奢望、然對於從事無名義無意味之戰爭、則日後終必有惡報一節、當不致盲目無覩也云云、</p>
<h3>但澤問題</h3>
<p>▲路透十五日倫敦電下院今日開會時、有請外相西門派巡洋艦一艘赴但澤、以防其選舉發生事變者、外相答稱、渠未見有派艦之理由、又稱、渠近晤駐但澤辦事大員、據稱、外間所傳此次選舉有發生嚴重擾亂之可能之驚人消息、殊不足信云、但澤國家社會黨自佔據工會總部後、態度突轉溫和、今日有領袖若干人謁見辦事大員、表示願與波蘭和好相處、謂此次選舉、國社黨如能勝利、則黨中之行政方針將爲對波親善、使波蘭人之生命財産得以安全、恪遵現有之各項條約、絕對忠守國聯担保之但澤憲法云、</p>
<p>▲國民十五日但澤電此間國家社會黨領袖福斯特今日以宣言致國聯駐但澤辦事大員羅斯汀、聲明但澤國社黨如接管政府、則擬與波人和好合作、並將竭力擔保波人生命與財産之安全、國社黨决議維持現行各條約、且擬恪遵國聯擔保之憲法、聞辦事大員巳接受此項宣言、視爲滿意、</p>
<p>▲國民十五日日内瓦電近數月内但澤自由城向國聯行政院呈訴反對波蘭侵逼之案、不下一百零六起、皆待行政院裁决、此足證但澤與波蘭交惡之甚、</p>
<p>▲國民十六日但澤電波蘭政府頃頒行新令、將使但澤自由城與波蘭間之貿易大受打擊、新令規定自五月十五日起、但澤運銷波蘭之商品、如無波蘭稅關員蓋印、則須在邊界退回、甚至行李亦須蓋印、新令突然頒行、並未預先知照、致但澤商界大爲驚詫、</p>
<h3>羅斯福將發宣言說明美國際新政策</h3>
<p>對歐洲局勢不再採袖手旁觀態度謀挽軍縮厄運促成經濟會議成功</p>
<p>（巴黎）德國政局有嚴重發展後、聞美代表台維斯已向羅斯福總統陳說立即發表宣言、表示美國對於歐洲和平直接注意之重要、美方指此爲美國將放棄門羅主義、改用新國際政策之表徴自昨日起、時局已完全變化、英法兩國所巳擬就準備在星期四日日内瓦軍縮會議提出之言論、將因今日美總統與明日希特勒之言論而大加修改、聞法國贊成美國對德發表和緩宣言之主張、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）軍縮會議之僵局、影響於經濟會議者至大且深、故美官場之惶慮、尤遠過於歐洲之執政者、頃聞接近總統者僉料美總統將發一博大痛快之宣言、聲明美國所抱關於歐洲和平之政策、大約星期二即可發表、其内容諒將宣告美總統戕圖挽救軍縮會議、以謀經濟會議之成功、但亦有逆料總統將更進一步、申請法德兩國保持和平者、並據駐歐代表台維斯私人電訊、台氏曾勸總統、美國對於軍縮問題已不能再取袖手旁觀政策、必須明白聲明其立場、因此一般消息靈通者今夜皆料美總統發表之意見、實際將與英國相若、並將有一大部份類似法國、據聞美總統曾研究對付侵略者施行制裁問題、料將宣布美國願於完全加入英相麥唐納所建議之諮商公約、而一般自稱深知總統態度者更謂總統將贊成商務制裁、而不主張憑用武力、至少不願用美國軍隊以屈服侵略者、但若總統之宣言設竟如若干人所預料、公然申請法德兩國維持和平、則時局必已非常嚴重、致令總統亦信兩國已瀕於公然决裂之境矣、按據白宮與國務院所接報告、目下全歐洲悉在猜疑之中、且有分成兩大派之趨勢、意·德·匃·爲一派、並得奥國之援助、對於法國·波蘭·及其與盟之一舉一動、莫不以猜疑目光觀察之、反之、法國波蘭及小協約國則反對一切修改和約之行動、重要列强中其未爲此猜疑空氣所籠罩者、僅英國與美國而已、設令此種局勢長此不已、則世界經濟會議將絕少完全成功希望、因此美國有出謀挽救之必要、現料美總統如發宣言時、日前渠與英相麥唐納所商得完全同意者亦可發表、並於國務院方面業已說明美國不贊成德國大規模之重行武裝云、（十五日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美總統羅斯福今日以世界領袖自任、邀各國自行保證勿派武裝隊伍逾越國境、並請全世界接受英相麥唐納之軍縮提議、美總統又在此聲明美國關於歐洲和平政策之宣言中、警告世界、謂當此危急之時、苟有任何强國拒絕明確登記其反對侵略行爲者、則災禍所招、世界將知咎責之所歸、余勸各國萬勿負此責任也、美總統嗣勸各國接受英相麥唐納軍縮計劃、作爲趨向避免戰禍之第一步、因該計劃將可實行大减侵略武器、樹立諮商制度、一旦遇世界和平受有威脅時、可以鳩合各國共謀補救也、此外美總統又提議當此開動機器、使舉世接受英國計劃之際、不應增加現有軍隊與軍備、宜由各國莊嚴保證勿增其作戰之具、按美人向來决意拒絕受諮商公約之束縛、美國總統此項宣言、實爲美國外交政策發生重要變遷之表示、（十五日國民電）</p>

<p>二十四軍劉自乾對於作戰早有充分準備、以第五師師長王元虎爲第一路總司令、率兵兩萬、進攻溫江、郫縣·灌縣·而爲導火綫、以第六師陳鴻文部兩萬二千餘人之衆、向簡陽方面壓迫、由陳任第二路總司令、以第一師張致和率兵三萬、由成都向新漢方面進逼、任張爲第三路總司令、雙方陣勢佈定後、五日、王元虎部在崇慶所屬石羊塲與黄逸民發生衝突、繼以激戰、三小時之槍砲聲、竟震破沉靜的川局、是爲再度川戰之開幕典禮、六日、雙方調動部隊愈急、準備大戰、七日、大戰、開始王元虎以五團之衆、與駐溫江之二十八軍周紹芝旅接觸、繼之以肉搏、周不支放棄溫江、二十四軍即入駐其地、劉自乾復以五萬之衆、向新漢·郫灌·總壓迫、欲將二十八軍驅入松理茂等地、而佔其地盤、八日、二十四八軍中之保定系將領·軍官系將領·又出頭作魯仲連、竭力調停、期縮短戰線、戰事不致擴大範圍、但奔走呼號、卒未成功、</p>
<h3>波動全省</h3>
<p>十日、戰雲密佈、空氣又趨緊張、十一日夜、簡陽方面即發生劇烈戰事、陳鴻文以十團之衆、猛撲縣城、經陳書農部·游廣居·孫賢頌旅·沉着應戰、王學姜旅復出奇兵相襲、遂將陳鴻文部擊退、雙方各死傷千人以上、十二日、劉自乾增調石肇武、牟遂芳·等旅應援、圍攻簡陽、直搗樂至、十三日、又發生大激戰、陳書農部實力薄弱、有不支之勢、但與駐安岳遂寗之新六師李其相取有相當聯絡、必要時李可參加戰爭、而與二十四軍對抗、駐射洪方面之二十九軍部隊、亦作援助二十八軍之準備、蓋竄川之赤匪爲促成川戰起見、特將通江·南江·巴中等地放棄、另具他項計劃、使川中各個軍閥、無所顧忌、自行火併、以收隔岸觀火之效、因而二十九軍遂有參加内戰之機會、與鄧晋康一致行動、共禦二十四軍之侵略、十三日午後、新都·灌縣·郫縣·二十四八軍均發生激戰、鄧晉康親在軍中指揮軍事、雙方不分勝負、</p>
<h3>表白態度</h3>
<p>鄧復通電全川、宣佈此次川戰之重開、純係二十四軍藉端挑釁、欺侮友軍、在此國難嚴重期中、行此大逆不道之事、請各方一致主張公道、以正義相援等語、而二十九軍田頌堯亦通電各方表示、謂劉乘川北赤匪尙未肅清之際、竟擅啓川戰之端、爲共黨造機會、舉師見逼晋康、無異向二十九軍示威、除以全軍參加、作正義之週旋外、必要時並將開闢路線、導入二十四軍防區、擾亂其各項工作、以懲其好亂成性之心、而劉自乾亦通電各方、謂該軍自前次戰爭以來、防地縮小、部隊無法維持、與其坐以待斃、無如開闢去路、暫假友軍防地、以作暫時解决目前之困難、而維現狀等語、駐防北道之二十軍楊森·及綏定之二十三軍劉存厚、對鄧劉之爭、特發出通電、表示態度、請立即停止軍事行動、雙方守着陣線靜候中央裁决、不得輕啓釁端、致苦川民、波動各軍、惟駐防川東南之二十一軍劉湘、態度曖昩不明、對各方毫無相黨表示、盛傳此次劉自乾之所以敢舉兵向二十八軍進逼者、事前實取得劉湘之同意、因劉自乾與劉湘本屬叔姪關係、前次戰爭、劉自乾防地被劉湘奪去四縣餘、且盡屬膏腴之地、以致該軍難於維持、故劉湘特默許其向他方發展、不加干涉、故無鮮明態度、現雖劉鄧兩軍大戰開始、亦無若何之表示、</p>

<h3>領事團昨討論檢查工廠問題</h3>
<p>會議秘密微聞已有妥善辦法</p>
<p>市府態度以不礙主權爲原則</p>
<p>關於公共租界納稅西人會特别大會、修改洋涇浜章程附律、企圖攫奪我方工廠檢查權、業經本埠領事團通過核准、呈送使團考核、故本埠領事團、於昨日下午二時三十分、在江西路美國領事館、召開大會、討論該項問題、茲錄開會情形如次、</p>
<h3>出席領事</h3>
<p>昨日出席該項會議者、計美總領事兼領袖領事克寗瀚·領事團秘書郎格·日總領事石射猪太郎·法總領事梅里靄·及各國駐滬領事曁代表等十餘人、</p>
<h3>會議秘密</h3>
<p>各國駐滬領事及代表等、於昨日下午二時許、均齊集美領署、於二時三十分、在該署二樓開會、至三時十五分散會、會議内容、殊爲秘密、幷無公報發表、參與會議之各領事、均不輕露一字、領事團領袖領事克寗潮·及秘書郎格、對於往訪之各記者、亦無一言發表、惟據記者探悉、經過三刻鐘之會議後、已得有具體辦法云、</p>
<h3>妥善辦法</h3>
<p>據可靠方面消息、關於修改洋涇浜章程附律第三十四條、自經本埠領事團通過後、呈報使團考核、但未獲准、並諭領事團商一妥善辦法、俾一方面顧及中國整個主權、一方面顧全租界内工廠安全、領事團昨日召集會議、即協商此項妥善辦法、已得决定云、又據另一方面消息、工部局前曾擬就一折衷辦法、由工部局設立一工廠檢查處、檢查員由工部局聘任曾經受過相當之工廠檢查訓練之華人担任之、幷規定期限、領事團昨會議中曾討論及之、</p>
<h3>市府態度</h3>
<p>市政府對於檢查租界工廠之態度、迄無變更、我國整個勞工行政之主權、决不容他人加以破壞、惟在不背中央原則之下、市政府極願與租界當局開誠商議、以求産生一妥善之解决辦法、據俞秘書長語中央社記者、中央對於交涉之原則、早經决定、惟市政府方面迄未與租界當局有任何接洽云、</p>
<h3>實部消息</h3>
<p>十六日南京電、實部息、滬租界工廠檢查權之爭執問題、我方提出原則六項、巳由滬市府秘書長俞鴻鈞、與工部局總裁費信惇於上星期即作非正式談話、意見尙稱融洽、但尙未正式决定具體辦法、須再作非正式談話一次、交換意見、嗣後雙方即以書面討論合作辦法、及檢查手續等、俟雙方意見相同後、即舉行正式會、屆時實部亦當派員出席、决定適當辦法云、</p>
<h3>平津一帶人民南下避難</h3>

<h3>中央造幣廠鑄幣數量日增</h3>
<p>已達二十萬元新紀錄</p>
<p>新聲社記者、於昨日上午、赴中央造幣廠訪該廠秘書處李科長、叩以出幣情况、及審查委員會成立諸問題、當蒙見告如下、</p>
<h3>新幣出數激增</h3>
<p>據李氏云、廠中新幣出數、前因工人皆屬新僱、一切皆須從事訓練、始日有進步、統計每日可增出一萬元以上、而一月來之進步、尤覺迅速、至上星期六、鑄成幣數、已達每日二十萬元、爲開鑄以來最高紀錄、將來每日出數、可達到三十一萬元云、</p>
<h3>審查委會成立</h3>
<p>銀幣成色、現用科學方法、完全假機器力量洗剔、較之藉人工洗剔者、已屬正確多矣、惟爲愼重起見、特組新幣審查委員會、從旁隨時監視之、該項委員名單、現已完全發表、内部章程及組織、現正由各委員積極籌備中、成立之期、現未確定、蓋新聘任之美國總技師格蘭德、現已由美啓程、本月底可到滬就職、故成立之期、當係總技師到滬後方能决定、至新模型亦待總技師由美帶來云、</p>
<h3>作中央準備金</h3>
<p>至於廠中自開鑄以來、所出數量、前後統計總數已達一百七十萬元左右、該項新幣、决定作爲中央銀行之準備金、同時因現鑄之模型、曾有一部份認爲不滿、故暫時不再流動於市面、故須俟新模型到後、再鼓鑄時、方將新幣通用於市上、外傳謂係審查委員會審查、即流通市面云云、係屬猜測之詞、</p>
<h3>津杭兩分廠事</h3>
<p>天津與杭州兩造幣分廠之恢復、總廠尙無確實消息、惟查恢復分廠之舉、其說尙在初實行廢兩改元時、因當時之意、恐實行用元之後、銀幣需要量、必然激增、故恐總廠出數不多、或將供不應求、於是遂主張於不敷供求之時、將津杭兩分廠恢復、現總廠出幣數量猛進、是否仍謀恢復、現尙未定云、</p>
<h3>華僑總公會訂定救濟旅墨回國難僑辦法</h3>

<h3>電孫院長</h3>

<p>丨安文普騙像出售反誣物主爲綁匪丨</p>
<p>丨安近以他案被逮物主亦提起訴訟丨</p>
<p>北平人安文普、突於本年三月間由滬赴港、冒充古董巨商、向港地寳源齋杰發棧兩古董店騙得象牙花瓶一只、古畫二幅、携之返滬、售與同孚路億寳齋等古玩舖、後經香港官廳據當地被騙者之報告、電請本埠公共租界警務機關、將該巨騙查獲、未及解港、而其在法租界又犯另案、由第二特區地方法院向第一特區地方法院提去研訊得實、茲已被判處徒刑、禁錮監獄中矣、惟該安文普去春在滬、尙騙取四川人張幼荃家藏</p>
<h3>唐塑童女神像</h3>

<h3>有一西人願買</h3>
<p>邀張同往西人處議價、詎該西人僅允給二千金、張因不欲賤賣、仍將像依回、旋得家電、怱促回川、乃以塑像付其女張韻鶴及婿吳錫安保管、囑令如得相當代價、不妨割愛出讓、張歸川未久、安文普又向吳索取該像、謂有主顧欲購、吳以安旣與其岳素識、遂以像與之、約於三日後决定、屆時安旣無回音、亦不還像、吳向催索則藉詞拖延、從此像入安手、歷時月餘、安竟潛行離滬、着人傳言、謂彼偕一</p>
<h3>西人携像赴日</h3>
<p>本東京、俟得善價、再行報命、吳亦無如之何、直至上年八月二十四日、纔悉安已返滬、寓跑馬廳大中華飯店四百十五號、吳與其妻及友人即往飭之、並詢以像之下落、安則一味敷衍、旋因吳詞色嚴厲、恐黑幕敗露、乃出立筆據、央友人金紹祿担保、限期三個月售賣、逾期歸還原物、否則償還代價洋一萬元、簽字之後、安必日換臥室、每與吳晤、復不以眞實住址相告、行踪極端詭秘、迨至十月中、所約之期將滿、此際吳忽聞人言、謂安早已將該像</p>
<h3>售得善價化用</h3>
<p>出立字據、無非籍此拖延、波將儘此期内塑一僞像交還、吳始大驚、即挽表兄徐伯揆帮同注意安之行動、至十一月二十二晨、吳接徐之電話、知安已至徐家、吳即馳往辣斐德路冠華里六號、與徐安等相晤、徐謂安决即將足與塑像相等之其他古物取來作保、但吳候至日晡、安之胞兄安文斌仍係徒手而來、詢以所取作保之古物、則云晚間九時交到、言畢遂去、直至夜半、文斌忽導法捕房</p>

<h3>國恥週演講陳彬龢先生講九一八</h3>
<p>五月十日在青年會講（續）</p>
<p>第三個感想：我們在九一八以前似乎是没有國難的！大家醉生夢死的只管享樂。九一八以後，遭到了事實上的嚴重的國難，我們的領土損失了十三分之一，人口損失了十二分之一，財産損失到四分之一！遭到了這樣重大的國難，我們應該問：九一八以前與九一八以後的一般情形比較起來，究竟有什麽不同？事實告訴我們，日本政府方面在九一八以後改變全國工廠爲製造軍需的工廠，又加緊訓練全國青年用種種方法煽動國民作仇華的行動。處處是表現戰時的狀態。我們的政府怎樣呢？在九一八以後開過一次國難會議，向國際聯盟提出許多文字抗議，發了許多宣言、勸人民要鎭靜。日本的學者（不是御用的）方面是主張公道，反對政府侵略的政策，他們勸導日本的國民不要妄從政府的侵略政策。而我們的學者却主張講和，主張承認事實承認二十一條，主張「我們再等候五十年！」我們再看，日本的資産階級九一八以後如何？不是拿出錢來帮助軍閥侵略中國因爲他們是同生命的。我們的資産階級仍舊做他們的投機生意，過他們享樂的生活！我們再看，日本的勞苦大衆怎樣？日本帝國主義者因爲要向外侵略增加軍費，勞苦大衆却没有得到一些侵略戰的利益反加重了負擔。中國的勞苦大衆如在閘北和在東北的直接受到帝國主義的蹂躪。或是間接受到很大的苦痛，故中日的勞苦大衆在九一八以後同樣的受苦。所以我們知道只有中日的勞苦大衆聯合起來才能粉碎日本帝國主義者和一切漢奸。</p>
<p>這些感想都者聽來不甚愉快的，我現在另外還有一個比較愉快的感想，就是九一八以後有東北義勇軍和馬占山蘇炳文等起來抵抗，一二八時有十九路軍起來抵抗。這種爲保護自己民族國家而起來作自衛的鬭爭，受到全國人民的擁護，受到國際的同情，更受到日本人民的佩服！</p>
<p>我們現在可以知道，從幾點的感想看來，我們往後所走的路除去爲民族生存而鬥爭之外没有别的！最近幾百年的歷史告訴我們，一七七八年的美國獨立戰爭失敗時，法國軍官辣裴德說美國的軍隊生活很苦，兵士都没有吃飽，衣服也没有齊全，他們的皮膚凍成了黑色了；可是他們都有一顆要求自由公道的信心。他們在艱苦卓絕之中終於得到了勝利。蘇俄革命的時候，帝國主義國家都起來武力干涉，蘇俄在最困難的時候要抵抗到十二條戰線之多，可是最終也得到了勝利，土耳其在歐洲大戰後和希臘戰爭，苦戰了三年之久，才告勝利，而成爲獨立國家。</p>
<p>我們現在也只有爲民族生存而鬥爭。只有鬥爭是我們的出路，只有鬥爭纔能够生存！</p>
<p>九一八事變後日本對於中國的觀察有兩種：一般軍閥的觀察說，中國陸軍在國防上是没有甚麽用處的，不過爲軍閥在國内作政治鬭爭的工具。他們又說中國這部歷史是循環地被異民族統治的歷史，是服從異民族所定的一切計劃的歷史。他們又說中國是一個無組織的國家。因此他們便輕視中國不是他們的敵手！另一種是日本學者的觀察，他們認爲九一八的事變於日本没有什麽好處，反而不啻吞下一個炸彈，於中國却足以促成各方領袖的團結，給中國一個統一合作的機會。給中國一個奮興革新的機會。</p>
<p>我們不知道敵人對我們所下的兩種觀察那一種是中了的！</p>
<p>美國的獨立戰爭，蘇俄的革命戰爭，土耳其的抵抗希臘戰爭，我們從歷史上的事實看來！知道我們以前失去的土地，以後也只有從戰爭去取牠回來！我們應該明白我們所希求的是中國的自由平等。這是一件價値極高的東西，不能略付些微的代價可以拿到；我們應該準備最大的犧牲，去取償這最大的代價！</p>
<p>我們還得經過多次的挫折，我們也還得經過多次的奮鬭，我們往後纔能夠求得民族的自由平等！（葉文雄張夔石記）</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>兩種人</h3>
<p>— 伯符</p>
<p>文學裏有散文和詩兩大類型，人也是一樣，有散文的氣質和詩人的氣質兩種。散文的人，是拿自己去迎合世界，詩的人是呌世界來適合自己。迎合世界的人，他的倫理極爲簡單，即以社會的善惡爲善惡：他的人生也極簡單，即以社會的生活爲生活；他的目的，更是簡單，即以社會所謂成功爲成功。這種人目的也簡單，頭腦也簡單，精神也簡單，但常是社會上最成功的人。至於詩人氣質的人呢？他是要世界來適合他自己，所以必然地是看不起世界上一切生活，因而必然地是個理想主義　，是個空想的人，是個敏感的頭腦。他的頭腦旣複　，精神更複雜，閙了一世，還不知他的目的在什麽地方，因此，只有失敗了。你不常聽見有一些做縣知事的人說嗎？「别人忍心拿的錢我們不忍心拿，所以窮了。」對了，這就是所謂詩人的氣質。</p>
<p>散文的人，表面上極恭維詩人的氣質，因此，他可以親近這一種人，去偷他，搶他，愚弄他。而且永遠地把他高高地恭維在清高的壇上，免得他走下和自己的事業麻煩。中國自古以來，便是人文之邦，讀書人處處受抬舉，大約受的是這麽個抬舉罷。</p>
<p>詩人氣質的人，極看不起這種散文的氣質，可是他除開輕蔑慢駡而外，别無辦法。結果，散文的人，就利用他不屑於作的事，自己去作，因而在社會成功了。</p>
<p>散文的人，其壞處就在一個魯鈍，所謂笑駡由他笑駡，好官我自爲之。詩人的人，其壞處就在虛榮。自以爲不合汚于俗流，結果便成了落伍者，自以爲是清高，結果便成了寄生虫。</p>
<p>說到此地，我想起學生時代的一件故事來，以前在東京的時候，同鄕，同學，學文的，學武的，眞是極一時之盛。有一天我們大家聚在一塊閒談，其中有一個學武的，是我們認爲口直心快的魯莽男兒。他便以散文的人特有的魯鈍，告訴我們他將來的目的。他率直地說了一大篇，歸納下來，便是「陞官發財」。</p>
<p>我們中又有一個學文的先生，大約是聽不過了吧，便掉着文向他譏諷似的說道，「人生不僅是陞官發財呵！」這是多麽一句詩人式的話喲！</p>
<p>可是，你知道那位童騃的魯莽男子，怎樣答法？他即刻回道：「你說的不錯，自然此外還有討老婆，坐汽車，住洋房等等。不過我要陞了官，發了財，這些東西自然會來的。」</p>
<p>他並不是在幽默，他只是口直心快。我們笑他是童騃，其實我們都上了他的當了。這便是他成功的秘訣。</p>
<p>果然；現在聽說他已做官了。而我們那位學文學的先生，此刻正因没有飯碗，連他的妻子，都看不起他，聽說要離婚呢。</p>
<h3>掘地窟與買飛機</h3>
<p>— 適夷</p>
<p>翻開報紙，又是兩行驚人的大標題：「敵軍向平津取包圍形勢，日機偵察北平。」</p>
<p>但是細觀下去，才知道這消息不但我們在兩方看報的不用吃驚，連飛機飛到頭上的北平，也是「官員亦殊鎭靜，並無驚擾之象。」足見近來日帝國主義的軍隊雖然在中國土地上節節進步，而中國人鎭靜功夫的進步，更是與日俱增。按照某中委盛稱徐州學生鎭靜的條例，實應傳令嘉許。</p>
<p>不幸美中不足的是北平市那些小學校長，却紛紛到社會局去請願，要在各學校　掘地窟」，未免有失鎭靜；不過躱在地窟中以謀安全，當不致驚擾友邦，或可酌量照辦。</p>
<p>每一個小學校掘一個大地窟，把課堂搬到地底下，不管頭上的飛機炸彈，安心上課讀書，靜待學成救國，去「收回失地」，這眞是比都德的「最後一課」還悲壯的奇景。</p>
<p>從北平小學生在地窟中上課，聯想到上海小學生在街頭募捐。硬拖住人家丢些錢到他們的竹筒裏，說是拿去買飛機救國。</p>
<p>如果人家拿了飛機來，我們也拿飛機去對抗，這也不失爲救國之一道。</p>
<p>但人家的飛機已經飛到北平城上，而我們的飛機，還在小學生的竹筒裏，怎不呌人急得滿頭大汗！</p>
<p>有人說：你弄錯了，買了飛機並不眞跟日本飛機去對仗，而是等待全個中國的土地都失盡了，中國國家無處安放時，才像上古大洪水時期中的「諾拉船」一樣，把「主權」「人民」等等都搬到飛機裏，航行到空中去。所以呌做航空救國。如果眞爲這一着，我們確應該多捐幾塊錢，多買幾隻飛機，免得將來要掘地窟也無處可掘。</p>
<h3>杜鵑花</h3>
<p>— 周光熙</p>
<p>趁着杜鵑花血一般紅的時候，我們到天平頑了一次。</p>
<p>我對於天平並没有多大留戀，可是對着天平歸路上的杜鵑花，那在沈西的斜陽下，碎錦似地鋪滿山坡的杜鵑花，却有幾分不忍捨去的情緒。</p>
<p>我俯下身忍心地把那柔嫩的杜鵑花採了一大把，想把它帶回上海做紀念，可是這有什麽用呢？一到上海，這美麗的花朶便會枯萎得不成模樣的。</p>
<p>悵惘的心情，再加上要長久佔有這花和葉的慾望，使我更殘忍地連根拔掘含苞未放的一棵。她雖是牢牢吻住泥土，終於被挑在手杖上隨我到上海來了。</p>
<p>回到上海寓所時，馬上將她種在花盆裏，很小心地放在露台上的凉處，每天灌着水，希望這移植的杜鵑花能夠在這苦悶的都市中給我一些安慰。</p>
<p>但不幸在離開天平的第二天，她的花便憔悴了，第三第四天，她的葉便枯槁了，一星期後盆裏祗橫着幾根乾瘠的枒枝，醜陋得像死人的枯骨。雖是殷勤地灌漑，畢竟没有挽住她的生命，這使人窒息的都市，這小小的花盆，對於她實在太不慣了，她終於物化了。</p>
<p>於是我想起了天平山下抬轎的娘兒們，那健壯，活潑，渾厚而誠樸的模樣，每個人身上都蘊藏着一種活力，這種活力是青年的生命，是城市中人所没有的。但這些娘兒們一移到城市，便會夫掉她們的健壯，活潑，渾厚和誠樸，便會失掉她們青春的活力。這，我們祗要看由鄕下轉來的上海各工廠的女工和帮人家的娘姨便知道。正如山上的杜鵑花一樣，在大自然中，雖是雨打風吹，日炙夜露，依然放出鮮豔美麗的花朶，可是一移到城市，便會憔悴枯萎一樣。</p>
<p>因爲農村經濟的破産，因爲上海繁華的誘惑，每天每時，不知有多少健壯的娘兒們從鄕間，從内地被火車輪船載運到這都市來斷送自己的青春，自己的健康和美麗，甚至自己的生命！</p>
<p>這不是和杜鵑花一樣的運命嗎？</p>
<p>人都如此，杜鵑花又算得什麽呢？</p>
<p>我對着憔悴了的杜鵑花，心裏更有無窮的悵惘！</p>
<h3>關於中國蜂</h3>
<p>— 李𢢑</p>
<p>以前我曾談過「盜蜂」的故事，說到意大利蜂趕跑了中國蜂。其實中國蜂老是這樣不長進，就是没有意大利蜂進來，也隨時有滅種的可能性。</p>
<p>中國蜂的寃家太多，最利害的是棉虫，常寄生在蜂箱下部，咬穿蜂箱，盜取蜂蜜和花粉。發育滋長，等到佔住到巢房來時，蜜蜂便無法可想，只好率羣而逃。其次是蜜蝶，有一二寸長，侵入時也是吸蜜汁，破巢臘，蜜蜂照例避而之他。再其次如燕，雀，晴蜓，蛙，蜈蚣，蛇，蟾蜍，莫非蜜蜂的死對頭，就中尤其是蟾蜍最巧最辣，張着嘴，懶洋洋地伺在蜂箱洞口，等蜜蜂爬出洞口，預備去工作，牠就以逸待勞的一口吞了；一個蟾蜍一天能吃五十個以上的蜜蜂。再其次是九里蜂了，這一種蜂以近山處爲多，較蜜蝶體小而悍，如果進來了一個，那箱蜜蜂除趕緊逃走外更無他法。</p>
<p>中國蜂所怕的這些，在意大利蜂都不當一回事。意大利蜂没有别的長處，牠們的長處只是合力禦敵。</p>
<p>中國蜂從來没有大的羣，稍稍旺盛了，便一分再分：今天分房去了一羣，明天又一羣失踪：頂有養蜂經騐的，也保不定牠們幾時要分封。蜂羣小，力量弱，抵抗力也便小，而工作效能也差了；冬天一到，食料缺乏，於是實行自殺政策丨丨「嚙臘」了。中國蜂過冬，簡直是挨命，至少要死一半工蜂。</p>
<p>近來有人着手改良，認爲要中國蜂繁盛，能團結，除非每個蜂身上沾些糖，也許牠們看見糖，會互相吸吮，一時不會離開。或者在每個蜂翅上洒上些膠水，使牠們拆散不開，才能使牠們習慣團體行動。</p>
<p>然而這也除非外國人來着手。咱們中國，就是人，一向也就是缺少糖，膠水這些東西的。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— ＪulesＫenaru林取作譯</p>
<p>章程（續）</p>
<p>「當雷辟克先生脫下了他的髒皮鞋時，同我把它拿到走廊了，但姐姐愛勒絲丁是無論如何也不會把替父親拿拖鞋的權利讓給别人的，這拖鞋是她親自繡的花。</p>
<p>「我担任一些走遠路的重要的差使，如到藥劑師或醫生家裏。</p>
<p>「你那方面呢，你担任到村裏去買零碎東西。</p>
<p>「可是不論天晴下雨，你每天得到河邊去洗兩三個鐘頭的衣裳。這是你的職務裏面最辛苦的工作，可憐的孩子；這事我一點也不能帮你。但祗要有功夫的話，我有時可以帮帮你的忙，把衣裳晒在籬笆上。</p>
<p>「我想到了：我貢獻你一個意見。你可不要把衣裳晒在菓樹上。雷辟克先生雖不會責備你，但却會把它輕輕丢在地上，而雷辟克太太發見衣上有一點痕迹時，便會呌你再去洗過的。</p>
<p>「還有關於鞋子的事，我得關照你幾句。穿着出去打獵的鞋子，你得塗上很多的油，普通的鞋子則祗擦上少許就够了。</p>
<p>「你對於那些泥汚的褲子可不要太弄乾凈了，雷辟克先生相信塗着泥土的褲子可以耐久。他在那些犁開的田裏走着，從來不把褲脚紮起。當雷辟克先生呌我背着獵獲袋跟他一路去打獵時，我却寗願把我的褲脚紮起。</p>
<p>「他對我說：「紅蘿蔔鬚，你永遠不會成爲一個眞正的獵人。」</p>
<p>「而雷辟克太太却對我說：「當心你的耳朶啦，你如果弄髒了一身。」</p>
<p>「這是各人趣味的問題。</p>
<p>「總而言之，你不會十分辛苦的。當我放假在家的時候，你可以分給我一半工作，等到我的姐姐，哥哥和我都到學校去住宿的時候，你又可以少做些工作。結局是一樣的。</p>
<p>「並且無論什麽人對於你都不會十分壞的。你試問問我們家裏來往的朋友，他們全會向你保證：我的姐姐愛勒絲丁像天使一樣的温柔，我的哥哥菲利克斯有着最好的心，雷辟克先生有着正直的精神和確實的判斷，雷辟克太太則有着少有的烹調的手藝。一家人裏面也許是我使你覺得最難對付的。其實，我並不如此。這祇要懂得我的性情就好了。况且我很服理，我會改過，不客氣的說，我會使自己變好，倘使你也稍稍虛心一點的話，我們便可以和衷共濟了。</p>
<p>「不，你不要呌我先生，你像别人一樣呌我紅蘿蔔鬚好了。這比雷辟克少爺還要簡短。不過我請你不要像你的祖母奥洛林一樣，用那種輕慢的語法和我說話。你的祖母說話常常傷害我，我很討厭她的。」</p>

<h3>歐洲各國敎育槪况（一）</h3>
<p>— 陸並謙記</p>
<p>丨程其保在市敎育局演講辭丨</p>
<p>今天講的題目、大槪可分四項來講、（一）此次考察的經過、（二）各國敎育槪况、（三）歐洲敎育趨勢、（四）中國的敎育問題、</p>
<p>一考察的經過我們此次考察的時間很短、實際計算、僅有六個月光景、經過的差不多有九個國家、　平均每一個國家祇躭擱二星期左右、時間旣短、事實上自然不能遍詢詳查、見到的、都是些不澈底的印象而已、因之一班人對於我們的期望、本來是很殷切的、以爲此次考察回來、一定有極大的貢獻、能替中國敎育開一張藥方來醫治這二十年來敎育的沉疴、然而事實是不免辜負了他們的期望、這一點、在我未講之前、應該先向諸位說明的、以後我們還希望大家本着互助合作的精神、來替中國敎育開闢一條簇新之路、</p>
<p>記得前年至去年正月、歐洲各國有一個中國敎育考察團到中國、中間有一位是德國的敎育總長、一位是法國的科學家、一位是英國的科學家、和經濟學家、他們到中國來考察敎育、時間很短、走路也很少、不過到過杭州·上海·天津南京這幾個地方、最近他們有一個報告、雖很詳細、但是自己也感覺到自己考察的情形、不能澈底明瞭曾經請求中國政府派幾個人到歐洲去、互相交換交換實際的情形、當時中國政府很贊成這種主張、所以派了五位去歐洲考察了八個月、在這八個月中、到過的各國、對我們的感情都很好、到一個地方、必受他們熱烈的招待歡迎、這一點、我們覺得中國對外的友誼還不錯、他們對我們此次的考察、都能表示同情、澈底了解、所以我們此行、一方面固負着我們的使命、一方面却也增進了不少的國際情誼、還有一件、我們覺得很慚愧、就是歐洲各國有好許多地方不明瞭中國情形、大地方尙奸、到了小地方、他們正同着我們見了外國人一樣的、看見我們和他們握握手、聽見我們和他們講講話、都是非常的奇怪、這實在由於中國對外缺少一種宣傳的緣故像日本便不然、比如中日問題、日本拼命的向外宣傳、甚至收買許多報紙、像波蘭有好許多報紙、都給日本收買、中國外交上缺少這種魄力、所以感到許多的困難、他們對中國未嘗不願予以援助、可惜中國的情形、他們很不明瞭這問題雖小、我們也該注意、</p>
<p>（二）各國敎育情形因爲六個月考察所得的印象、十分複雜、要把他整理清楚、也非易事、今天祗能摘要的報告、以後如有機會、再當分别討論歐洲各國在戰後十五年中敎育上都有極入的變遷、他們受了大戰的創傷、都感覺到敎育制度方法的改革的需要、這種改革、從大處去看有兩方面一方面因爲現代民族復興、要使自己民族的繼續發揭、自然、有賴於敎育的力量、過去的大戰、不知損失了多少人的生命財産、主　的原因雖多、敎育方法的錯誤、也是其中之一、顯明的錯誤、大槪有三點、（一）過去的敎育太國家化、敎育的知識和方法、都偏重於國家生存的維持、因此國際間造成一種不洽的現象、處處以自己的國家爲重、國際間的衝突隨之而起、（二）過去的敎育太物質化、敎育的結果、大家唯利是圖、祗求物質上的滿足、不問精神上的舒適、以致個人生活不能平匀、社會的衝突也起、（三）過去的敎育太知識化、把學校看作求知的塲所、不求個人生活的適應、有此三點、間接便釀成了空前的歐洲大戰、現在要建設新的民族、就該把自己的民族建立在理性的基礎之上、以文化適應民族的需要、一方面提倡天才敎育、希望各人都能利用天才、發見新的創造、然後和舊文化融會貫通、造成新的文化、這種變遷、是從大體上講的、此次考察的八國、敎育上變遷的程度和方法也有不同、入槪可分析爲四類、（一）英國和法國、實際上他們變遷的程度很淺、（二）新興國家、在大戰後、根據民族自决的精神、建立了許多小國、像波蘭·捷克等、他們過去是没有敎育制度的、立國以後、不得不從頭做起、創設新的敎育系統、建立新的敎育制度、中間有許多材料、可供我們參考、（三）德國和奥國、他們在戰後、政體旣變、敎育的制度和方法也變、（四）最値得注意而有趣味的、是俄國和意國、這兩個國家、在政體上絕然不同、似乎不能合在一起、實在俄國行共産主義的政治、政權操在無産階級手裏、意國也是一黨專政的國家、把敎育當作政治的工具、要貫澈政治的主張、全賴敎育的力量、他們的情形、正同中國一樣、値得我們格外的注意、以下再分開說明、</p>

<h3>吃癟</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>吃癟兩個字，是蘇滬流行的一種土語，其中的函義，彷彿有把人打倒的意思；但，打倒是用手的，吃癟是用嘴的，嘴的作用，比着手的作用還兇。所以，被打倒的人，有時跌得快，扒的更快；而被吃癟的人，若要返本還原，和從前一般的股肉飽滿，膚革充盈，這便應了東方先生一句話：「談何容易」。</p>
<p>我來舉兩個便：被打倒的人，只是捱了一下悶棍；倘使，體質虧弱，受不起這重大打擊，或者便要一蹶不振，一暝不視。如其不然，托地跳將起來，奪了那人的悶棍，「即以其人之道，還治其人之身」，那麽，被打倒的人也可以把人打倒發洩這一口惡氣。至於，被吃癟的人，那便希望絕少了！脂膏，血肉，都已被人吸去，只剩那「塌蠟扁」的一個空皮囊，郤遠要自吃安心丸，以爲一定可以和從前一般的肌肉飽滿，膚革育盈；嘿！快去讀一部「難經」邑！只怕千難萬難，比着甚麽都難。</p>
<p>中國是一隻晶瑩豐潤的水蜜桃；給那饞嘴敵人骨都骨都的吸個不休，當然是居於被吃癟的地位了。但，世界各國，不盡是容易吃癟的水蜜桃，爲什麽德國非常注意的太平洋島嶼，現在郤不想收回呢？敢是德國被東洋人吃癟了麽？爲什麽蘇俄所不肯讓步的中東鐵路，現在肯賣給仇人呢？敢是我俄國被東洋人吃癟了麽？話雖如此，德俄被東洋人吃癟，畢竟還保留着面子；德，只是半吃癟，俄，只是準吃癟，惟有我們老大帝國蛻化的少年民國，竟是一個全吃癟！半吃癟的是癟大，準吃癟的是癟二，全吃癟的竟是一個癟三了！近來癟二出賣中東鐵路，我們政府向蘇俄提起抗議；結果，自討没趣，落了一句「失郤道德上權利」的批評。唉！癟二和癟大交涉，當然不敢怎麽樣，現在提抗議的不是癟大是癟三；那麽，準吃癟的癟二，又要來吃癟那全吃癟的癟三了！</p>
<p>照着東洋人的胃口，差不多要把全世界的國度都吃癟了，方才快意；但是，矮子的肚裏，果然吞的下偌大的一個地球麽？吞了下去後，肚皮裏不會發生着火山爆裂麽？這倒是一個疑問。</p>
<h3>難僑</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>因爲國内政治不上軌道，社會組織不健全，失業的人很不容易找到工作，有了工作又苦不能維持生活，所以出賣汗血的同胞，想盡方法溜到外洋去。雖說他們在外洋一切生殺予奪之權，悉操諸外人之手，不得不度着非人的生活；好在忍耐刻苦是中國人的特長，所以他們在慘淡經營之下，居然能站定脚跟，而且有許多人着實發些洋財。他們高踞在國内各種階級的老百姓之上，人稱之曰華僑。</p>
<p>他們能用方法去弄洋人的錢，而且還能輸財回國補助種種救國新名詞所需要的經費，在中國方面看來，當然是再好没有的事情。可是在洋人眼中，就實在看不過去。他們自己國内正在鬧不景氣，失業人數也很多，假使竟讓他們所認爲卑鄙到狗都不如的中國人去搶他們的飯碗，眞所謂「率獸而食人，惡在其爲民父母，」所以一般洋人的「父母，」爲見好其人民計，没有一國丨不管它是大國，小國，强國，弱國，丨不在拚命的趕走華僑。至于趕的方法，大别之可分爲藝術的和不藝術的兩種。日本趕走華僑的手段，是焚掠屠殺，方法最不藝術。菲列賓，暹羅，美利堅，墨西哥等國，就藝術得多了。他們先用種種重稅使華僑不能立足，不得不走。如果仍是趕不跑，焚掠屠殺的手段，簡或要仿傚一下。現在墨西哥的華僑，不是已經覺得没有存留的可能，一批批很狼狽的逃回祖國來了嗎？這些就是本文所說的「難僑，」一個與「災官」同樣新鮮的名詞。</p>
<p>其實，我們旣生在這種殺機四伏的二十世紀，偏偏又不幸給上帝編遣到充滿着死氣的中國，也只得樂天知命，得過且過。况且一般人所杞憂的政治不上軌道，社會組織不健全，失業人民無法安揷，這也不過是暫時的問題。只要常服「不死藥」拉長着壽數去守，縱使你的一輩子不能如願，你得立下遺囑，命你的兒子，孫子，曾孫，玄孫，……寗可靜待天機而死，不得妄逞人謀圖存，不愁没有得見昇平氣象的一天。實在犯不着遠涉重洋去受洋人的骯髒氣。如果一味要逆天行事，則一切橫逆之來，誰也未便負責，誰也不敢過問，有苦說不出，有怨無處伸，那纔眞正可憐呢！</p>
<h3>蒺藜</h3>
<p>— 殺羽</p>
<p>娼妓可以振興市面；特貨，可以寛裕稅收；賭塲，可以養遊民；誰說烟賭娼没有益處！日機飛偵北平，才知要人們把古物南遷，確有先見之明。</p>
<p>婦女，對於天時的熱度，感覺特别敏銳。在這暖和的初夏，已隨處可見露出玉腿的現代姑娘。</p>
<p>在酒店茶寮中兜賣小吃的姑娘，竟也學旅館中賣花女郎，向吃客挨賣東西，足見謀生的不是易事。</p>
<p>都市中過夜生活的人，决不會感到「落花流水春去也」的時日飛馳。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第六回甜苦情場冷觀評兩面崎嶇世路密約訂三年</p>
<p>積之笑着。抬了兩下肩膀道：你這是隨便說的話，没有誠意。你是答應明天來，你還是答應後天來呢？而且……桂枝正着臉色道：說來說去，無非是這些話，我來作什麽？積之道；我這又要問你了，爲什麽你答應好的兩個字呢？桂枝也不覺噗嗤一聲笑了，便道：你不用問，現在我們是將就着啦，你呌我們什麽時候來，我們就什麽時候來，我們可不敢誤卯呀？說着又是一笑。積之看到這種樣子，絕對是不能將他挽留下來的，只得放下手來，點着頭道：言重言重，就是明天這時候，我們在這裏相會，不見不散。桂枝臉上帶着淡笑，答道：好罷。積之笑道：不行不行，你答應得這樣隨便，知道來不來呢？桂枝道：那麽，要怎樣答應呢？積之道：你要說就是那樣辦。桂枝微點着頭道：哦！就是那樣辦。那句話最後一個字，却拖得是極長。積之道：你瞧，你總是這樣隨便的答應着我。不過我知道，你是和我開玩笑，明天來是會來的。桂枝也不再和他說什麽了，一把拉開了他的身子，就跨步走出這雅座的門去了。積之爲着把明天的約會訂得更切實些，就跟着在他後面，一路走到門口。桂枝回轉身來道：你别送，我不願意你送。積之笑道：不要我送，我就不送，可是……桂枝笑道：我明天不來，你老等着罷。說着一扭身驅走了。積之覺得他這個時候，態度非常之活潑，自然心裏也是很高興的。他說明天不來，那正是會來，明天老早的來等他就是了。積之如此想着，一頭高興，走回雅座裏來開發點心賬。自己還不曾跨進門，却聽到隔壁雅座裏面，有人呌了一聲積之。這聲音一聽就明白，乃是兄長厚之。這可奇怪，他是什麽時候來的？大槪剛才和桂枝說的話，一齊讓他聽了去了。情不自禁的，心房就卜卜跳了起來。正猶豫着，第二聲積之，又呌了出來，這眞讓他爲難。然而如何躱閃得了呢？只得硬着頭皮，向隔壁雅座裏走了去。（七二）</p>
<h3>香烟</h3>
<p>— 阿絜</p>
<p>我們在外面度着單調生活的人唯一的慰藉品，要推「香烟」了。劉伶把酒當作慰藉品，盧仝把茶當作慰藉品，豈知茶酒之外，還有香烟丨酒、多喝要亂性：茶，多喝也無味，唯有這一根紙捲烟，倒是消愁遺興的妙物。不時地把它來親芳澤，香噴噴比美人兒還要來得可愛咧。</p>
<p>美人之爲物，可欣賞而不可褻翫，眞和花朶兒一般。不過有的喜歡牡丹。芍藥穠艶的花；有的喜歡梅，菊，芙藥，清麗的花；有的喜歡蔴蕪、紅蕉、桃、李、觀麗的花；有的喜歡水葓、木犀、牽牛、澹沱的花；這是各人的觀念不同邑了。唯有香烟，不在欣賞而在褻玩，好像家家的有家主婆，人人要擁黄臉婆，這是目下我們貴國的一個現象！</p>
<p>有事的時候，吸了香烟，可以提神：没事的時候，吸了香烟，可以解悶：飯後酒餘，香烟尤爲必需之品。要是你老人家下了决心，想把慧劍，斫斷情絲，老是辦不到的：所以香烟一名呌做「相思草」，也可見它的魔力了。</p>
<p>香烟還可以增進夫婦的愛情，偶逢尊夫人賭氣的時候，溫存體貼，花言巧語，不能發生效力：只要你老人家恭恭敬敬地端上一枝香烟，點着了火柴，送到尊夫人的櫻唇旁邊，自然嫣然一笑百媚生，可以塡平恨海，可以補滿情天，便覺得發生意想不到的效力，免爨一齣陳季常梳妝跪池的把戲。據這個幾何學的定理，應用到大人先生面前去，也一定發生同樣意想不到的效力。所以，香烟又可呌做「神仙棒」。香烟有害這一句話，在下始終不敢承認。</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>脚魚與鯽魚</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>鱉一名脚，以腹部青白，内河産者爲佳，爲春令中有益之食品，有菜花黄牡丹開時，最爲時鮮；故有「菜花脚魚」「牡丹脚魚」之稱，食法以清燉爲宜·惟洗刮須凈，先加水略煮至沸，乃去水置入罐中，加南腿，竹笋，冬菇，猪油丁，冰糖，陳酒及鹽，薑等少許，密蓋隔水文火燉爛，殊清腴可口·若加紅棗二三枚同煮，能除腥味·又粤菜中脚魚。與黑鷄脚等同煮名鳳爪水魚，亦别饒風味，惟在夏令，似不宜食·俗謂脚魚爲蚊所吮，卽有毒，名「蚊子脚魚」·須到八九月間，「桂花脚魚」上市，始可大嚼·又鯽魚入夏卽乏鮮味。據漁人言：過立夏後，水鼠能化爲鯽魚，故亦以不食爲宜也。</p>
<h3>紫藤花餅</h3>
<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>當春夏之交，盛開於村野或庭院之紫藤花，（北方俗稱藤簍花）據鄕人謂有雌雄兩穩，色均紫了惟雄者多豔而無香，僅供路人之欣賞而已；雌者色淡而有香，可以製餅，味極可口，誠點心中之雋品，家父在世時最嗜之，兹當紫藤盛開時節，爰述製法如下，以供饞嘴同志·摘雌者數十朶，去其蕚，以花瓣入清水略洗·用麵粉四兩，鷄蛋兩隻，白糖二兩，（嗜甜食者可略加）以半飯碗之清水調和，再將洗凈之花瓣拌入調匀，傾入平底油鍋，約煎二三分鐘卽成。製法極簡便，而芬芳雋永，食之别曉風味，以之餉客，尤覺可貴，凡吾饞嘴同志，盍一試之（按該花曾經化騐食之毫無妨礙且有益消化·）</p>
<h3>常州食品</h3>
<p>— 顔也</p>
<p>饅頭丨南翔饅頭，素馳譽海上，然我吃着不覺其佳·初以爲橘逾淮而變爲枳，星期假日，趕到南翔去嘗試，也不見得如何高明·因爲吃慣了我們常州饅頭，遂覺天下饅頭皆無味矣·（太誇狂了罷）我們常州饅頭，式樣和南翔的彷彿而略小·惟皮更薄，裏面的肉餡，堅結如球，不分不散，餡外皮裏，有汁甚多·常州饅頭之好，就好在這皮薄汁足·吃時須先咬破了皮，把汁吸盡，不懂這門檻，就要給汁燙痛了唇舌，或濺得淋漓滿桌，或汚及衣服·又食時佐以薑醋，眞覺其味無窮·常州各大茶館，都兼賣點心酒菜，早上之饅頭生意最大·饅頭分兩種，一種是普通的，就如上面所說·一種是如蟹的，須到秋風聲裏才有得吃·前者每個售銅圓兩枚，後者售三枚，眞是價廉物美的好點心·現此饅頭已來海上了，店名大發，開設雲南路天蟾舞臺旁，是常州人來經營的，一切廚司堂倌，也都是常州人，所以這裏饅頭，和在常州的式樣味道，完全相同，老饕們不妨去嘗試一下，以證我言如何·不過價錢比在常州賣得貴些，普通的售洋二分，　蟹的須五分，此以海上一切開支高於常州多多，不得不然，但你去吃後，你仍會說一聲物美價不貴也·其二爲洒釀·上海市中的酒釀圓子店，他在招牌上必冠以常州二字，此蓋表明常州酒釀甚有名也·然我們常州地方，却未有稱酒釀佳者·常州也見不到有專售酒釀回子之店，小酒店中雖也有酒釀搭賣，但不過不會飲酒的婦孺偶而去買些來所謂謂吃吃白相而已·常州地方並不以酒釀馳譽，而海上則酒釀店必冠常州二字，眞令我英明其妙·其三爲蔴糕丨上海之大餅，猶我常州之蔴糕·上海大餅有人不屑齒及，常州蔴糕吃了會贊不絕口·此蔴糕也和大餅同一製法，惟酥鬆無比，入口如嚼蛋糕·甜的中實脂油白糖，鹹的用脂油與鹽，晨吃一塊，卽足果腹·大茶館中多有，和饅頭同作點心賣也·前輩留學生前蘇州高工校長鄧着先生到常吃過一次後，卽逢人稱常州蔴糕之美，可見我言不虛了·不過須製好就吃，冷了就無味，所以必須定做，而没有製好待售的</p>

<h3>糧食河下米價重挫角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三四十號、市况依舊不振、良以端節將屆、營業未免有所影響、是以衰頽景象尤甚、另躉兩胃、雖有參差、市價終見慘落、如蘇同粳及南港米雖見、本街作客不多、納胃零星、故售方意欲扳緊、然事實不得其志、緣價再貶角砠、薄稻如此洋帮·北平·威海衛·仍都屬意高料、南洋帮·興化·福州不約而同、中關惟少數兩帮動辦、僅千數百餘包、又皆吃盤嚴厲、致青角·松江·泗楓·西練等貨續修角許、回溯近月頂盤、屈指相較已落元譜矣、北洋尖亦以胃呆價跌數分角砠不等、陰變元幸屆時令市價無甚軒輊、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源念餘號、白粳走化店胃揀短價稍代、市形又小二角、薄粳早稻呆胃仍呆價小一二角、羊杜尖到雖不旺、零拆交滯、價小一尺、陰變元去路微細價疲尺外、</p>
<h3>賣風席捲粉麥市塲</h3>
<p>粉市、上午開盤後各月份市面又一致呈傾跌之象、以洋麥報價、又回小二角左右、而國内之景象、則愈呈險惡之狀態、以平津一帶、形勢旣日凌亂、且有早不保夕之趨勢、故上午開價後、津帮仍步步回出、遠期亦因新麥將次豋塲、幷預測可以豐收、業内外均一致出檔、所以市氣、均見萎疲、迨至下午開盤、本月份以北方時局、更覺嚴重、實銷帮態度、異常悲觀、致多頭地位、深感不安、六月份以次、亦以大小廠微有抛出、開價又見不振、觀此穩情形、如北銷果斷、或者本月份跌到二元三角半、亦未爲奇也、結果本月份較前日又跌二分、六月份跌二分二厘半、七月份跌一分半、八九月份跌一分二厘半、十月份跌一分、</p>
<p>麥市上下午各月份市面、又見步跌不已之象、查此次之跌風、良因國内新麥收獲在卽、而廠家方面、因在新麥時期、尙有多量之洋麥、足資生産、對於薪麥、目下暫無注意、日來又以北方如是局面、此後粉銷、必受打擊、麥市自更無望、故上下午各盤、賣氣極盛、價遂頻落不已也、結果七月份較前日又跌四分、八九月份跌五分、十月份跌六分、</p>
<h3>洋客秈客銷甚暢</h3>
<p>昨日福州帮辦胃甚貪、在市暢辦湘贛客秈外、又辦去小絞洋米、及蕪湖南京江北新到之客秈、全市成交八千包左右、疲落之市面、亦因此撑住、查市上存底尙充、除各路客秈外、洋米存數更夥、邇日滬市連朝活潑、來源尤見絡續不絕、湘贛以外、又有本省杜尖客秈及皖各秈、均有抵埠、天氣炎熱、本銷平淡、囤戶均擬售出、卽本街上亦有回出之意、貨主以天炎均求急脫、市面隨見下趨、昨日閩胃甚貪、除溫州辦去湖南機靖米二百多包外、盡由閩帮辦去、本街未辦、且將買成之小絞米一千五百包回與閩帮、各米行情與前市相同、未有出入云、</p>
<h3>絲茶蘇浙蠶汛近聞</h3>
<p>（如臯）亦爲蘇屬蠶桑區域、岔河丁堰掘港雙甸油坊頭馬塘白蒲李堡等區農民、對於育蠶甚爲注重、近年來因天時不正、蠶繭連遭失敗、蠶本虧蝕無餘、農村經濟破産、今屆蠶戶咸借本飼育、無如借貸困難、飼蟻不暢、早帮孵育土種者占十之四、晚帮飼育洋種者多、天氣和暖、蠶蟻發育順利、早帮已三眠放棄、次則三眠起眠、晚帮尙祇二眠開葉中、現狀甚佳、</p>
<p>（長興）農民鑒於連年蠶繭歉收、意與蕭條、今屆蠶戶經濟拮据、咸向鄕區公所借本飼育、白阜埠·虹星橋、鈕店橋·胥倉橋·和平·林城·下源波·四安等處、孵育改良種者多、氣候和暖、收蟻頗齊、發育亦佳、早帮將三眠、次則二眠放棄、晚帮尙祇二眠、桑葉産盛、供過於求、葉價每百斤祗三四角、前日雷雨終宵、幸蠶蟻尙幼、無甚影響、</p>
<h3>川經法銷尙不寂寞</h3>
<p>▲白廠經價小本重…輯里經貨缺難暢▲</p>

<h3>最近婺源茶訉一束</h3>
<p>（新茶估計蝕收）婺邑四鄕新茶、山戶開園、已星周、但因氣候寒冷、茶芽撳難茁發、每日出貨稀少、在往年經六七日之採製、至少有半數以上之收成、刻各戶製就新茶、尙未達總産量十分之四、據茶戶估計、云本年茶産豐欠不一、有的與上年相彷、有的照舊七八折、甚者還有對折之欠收、其原因就是因爲天氣不暖、茶摘嫰頭、蝕收當不能免、總計本年全邑茶産豐欠均扯、較往年自屬有减無增、</p>
<p>（山戶暗地呌苦）本邑貧苦農戶、旣無自佃之田地、一年家支所出、全恃茶價收入爲挹注、今歲茶産、普告蝕收、人工伙食柴炭所費、較舊未减、茶號受着去年之折本、對今歲山價、均主降低二三十元、蝕茶蝕價、兩頭剥削、每見茶園樹下採茶之山戶、莫不垂頭喪氣的暗地呌苦、</p>
<p>（茶棧銀根仍閉）駐茶茶棧、在曩年招徠放匯、興趣趨熱烈、近年間被少數投機茶號失敗控棧、及鑒去年茶號又遭巨創、今年茶市未見好轉、以及金融來源不暢、咸移轉目光、緊縮放匯、記者頃詢某棧當局、今年營業方針如何、彼卽毫不遲疑的答道、今年宗旨、槪不接客、任號自由投棧云云、棧方意態之倦勤、及放匯之緊閉、於斯可見、</p>
<p>（茶號紛紛開塲）本邑四鄕茶號、穩實者固佔多數、無本投機之茶號、其間亦不在少、去年各號均受普遍之大虧、今歲原有殷實茶號、旣苦舊資之盡罄、新資又難咄嗟立籌、對此銀根關閉不通、着實頗費綢繆、故在兩旬前、各號謀開塲者、仍如鳳毛麟角、不料本周來、新茶開採豋場、抱定不談茶經之號商、又禁不住的食指大動、連日來無論是殷實與非殷實之新老茶號、約十分之八、已在準備開秤、似仍繼續努力其經營、但其中有少數投機之茶號、能否悉數開門、尙須視籌得資金與否而定、此時不過呌囂凑熱鬧而已、</p>
<p>（山價未來預測）山價廉昂、關係箱茶成本輕重、近十年來、因茶號之競爭抬俏、山戶採製人工伙食費用遞昂、每担由三十元逐漲至九十元、以往數年、茶號因未打敗杖、故對新茶山價、爲爭先搶辦、多不暇計及貴賤之、一律跟盤收買、去歲受了本重致虧之敎訓、今年却不能不顧及山價高低之較量、各號近日口頭宣稱、均一致主降山價、或謂每担作盤三十元、或主百元買三担、有主至多四十元、如違此限、則片葉不進、話雖如此說法、不知貨主之山戶、能否俯首相從以記者之推測觀之、將來開秤、　在五十元間左右耳、</p>

<h3>糖市隨標金漲勢甚勁</h3>

<p>— 小子</p>
<p>丨因以證明中國必不亡丨</p>
<p>連日報載，華北形勢，又趨緊張，憂國之士，便多了一些抵足談天的資料，於是有人說「熱河放棄，各口失守，多倫陷落，以至於最近之敵軍圖取灤河以西，飛機向平津示威等等，這都是當局袖手之過，不肯把勦匪的兵力分一些去抗日，不然，敵人總不敢這般猖狂·</p>
<p>然而這究竟是老朽之談，迂腐得不足道的，中國如何會亡呢？此君没有讀過幾何學，所以不懂「」Ａ角等於Ｂ角，Ｂ角等於Ｃ角，故Ａ角亦必等於Ｃ角」之道理，當然亦不會知道「攘外必先安内」更無從知道「安内就是攘外」的至理眞義了！不過老朽總是自恃其老，與不服老的，所以我需要解釋幷詳細引證一下，</p>
<p>中國！記着，只是中國！目前有兩個敵人，一個是「帝國主義者」所以據說我們要有「反帝」的戰爭，另一個敵人，則是中國的死敵，據說此敵之危害我中國十百千萬倍大於「帝敵」（這是杜撰）此敵姓「赤色」而亦名「帝國主義者」，其别字則爲「共匪」所以我們便又有「殺共」「剿匪」的戰爭。不過「帝敵」是外來的敵人，而「共匪」則爲内裏的敵人，故「共匪」比「帝敵」，當然應當要嚴重得許多，因爲，譬如今有人焉患了瘡癤等皮膚病，另一人則害心臟病，或是肺結核，不久，患心臟病或是肺結核的人，因爲醫治不易而便蹺了辮子，那一位生瘡癤的朋友，則愜愜意意的天天吃着猪油蒸南棗。最多也不過剜去這塊腐肉，或是棄掉一層皮膚，老命是决不會因以送終的，再譬如；一隻肥嫩鮮美的生梨，若是你拿一把小洋刀剜去牠的一角肉，過了些時，雖說牠的皮肉變了顔色，但絕對不會生蛆的，而若是核裏起了化學作用，從核心腐爛出來，那可没有藥救了，所以「共匪」好像心臟病或是肺結核，又是致使生梨核心腐爛的蛆，我們欲求保留中國的老命根子，是非根本療治，把一隻一隻的「蛆」生擒活捉來踏死不行的，至於「帝敵」是没有多大關係，好像生癩疥瘡，只須把這些生了瘡的皮膚「剜棄掉」和吃一些「猪油蒸南棗」之類就行了。</p>
<p>連日來日軍雖說着看進逼，華北愈趨危殆，然而那是不關緊要的，因爲同一張報上還同樣用鉛字刋載着「剿匪」軍事的節節勝利，和克復「匪」區生擒「匪」首等等之類的消息，而這消息不便是中國必不亡的可喜可驚而至於發癩發狂的事實嗎？</p>
<p>幷且，「剿匪」還有一種副作用，即是對「帝敵」的一種强有力的示威行動，就是說，你莫胡鬧，我有兵力，你不信，我試給你瞧！</p>
<p>老朽乎，你塞緊了的茅塞開也未？</p>
<h3>贖當</h3>
<p>— 文炳</p>
<p>從報館的會計處或書局的櫃前兜轉回的朋友，大抵是兩手緊抓着口袋，現出異常興奮的色相，三步縮成兩步，首先跨上跳舞塲或電影院·然後，在迷糊的暮靄裏，才可見到若輩的瘦長的後影，閃映在堡壘似的當舖前。</p>
<p>爲了某種原因，經濟的鎖鍊，一篐一箍的鐐上我的身來，於是在上月尾梢的一天傍晚，我像賊骨頭似的偷摸着，創皇着，走到了高過頭蓋的當舖櫃前，耳根同臉袋，一陣泛紅，一陣發青，熱刺刺的；眼睛也花了，只見屋子在旋廻，櫃上裝架着的鐵欄柵，更好像一根一根的玬倒在我的額上，是一陣透骨酸痛。在暈迷了的意識裏我領取了錢，便一股氣走了回來，躺上床，滿手摸一把冷汗，心忐忑着。</p>
<p>論理，是不應該有這種窘相了，幾年的飄泊生活，進當舖，不像家常便飯一樣的平凡了麽，該有點經騐了。而况現在還有這條命，還能出入當門，在今日之中國，總算也可自誇一聲「準幸運兒」的人物呵。而况當今文壇權威的魯迅先生，不也曾經歷過這樣　段人生生活麽，有甚干係？</p>
<p>然而一向總還像走失了靈活似的不安。</p>
<p>是大前天了，從報館裏歡天喜地的走出來，經過跳舞塲，心兒有點發慌，意識馬上告訴我，這不是你需要去的地方，而况還不曾有絲毫經騐，怎得進去？走過電影院，恰巧碰着在映甚囂塵上，還參加過意大利萬國電影展覽會的國産傑作！都會的早晨，脚跟兒再不向前移動了，於是乎就停駐在那兒。</p>
<p>從電影院出來，依照一般的程序，是要上當舖去了，然而時候雖已到了五點，太陽却還斜掛在西空。經騐告訴我，這時候上當舖，即使是贖取，耳根臉袋還會一樣泛紅發青，最可惱的那些門前過路的人，往往不相干的向你瞟視。兜了一大個圈子，夜色才漸漸的展開，於是我帶了一顆興奮的心走上去，一來贖當是比較榮運的事，二來我這次的當，竟不上一個月便有贖的可能，顯然是生活有了起色。記得前年冬季當在閘北一個當舖裏的衣褲，經過「一二八」暴日的一次砲火，等到去年四月裏去探訪，已連當舖都不見了，那才惱人。錢擺上高高的櫃台，呌一聲「取當」，鐵欄柵内便現出一個走油的肥臉孔。但這是我一點兒也不窘迫了，在立候着的五分鐘裏，取當的只有我一人，但高高的櫃台下却擠滿了顧客，門口還在湧湧的進，男的，女的，老的，少的，高的，矮的，也有黄包車夫，也有西裝少年，也有衣着襤褸的貧苦婦人，也有旗袍革履的摩登姑娘，一個個帶着不安定的靈魂，不安定的色相，睜着跟仰望那鐵欄柵内走油的肥臉孔「這生意眞好」！我默讚着，忽而門口又現出了一個傴僂的老嫗，「那才是眞正的貧民喲」！我轉而這樣默念着，「四角六分利錢」！我猛的轉眼　視　「按月利息一分八厘」的掛牌，不由得口裏溜出了這麽一句：「這才是高利貸的盤剥地方呵」！</p>
<p>「那才是眞正的貧民喲」！「四角六分利錢」！「按月利息一分八厘」！「這才是高利貸的盤剥地方呵，回家時，我一路這樣念着，彷彿有一幅破落不堪的社會景片放映在我的眼前。</p>

<p>— 廷華</p>
<p>本校（中國公學）法律系同學，每屆畢業時期，除參觀各區法院外並參觀各處監獄以資實習研討前日（十四日）與同學蔣章根文炳等四十六人由本校楊敎授率領前往漕河涇參觀江蘇第二監獄，是日上午九時，齊集法租界貝當路校内雇大汽車數輛，直達目的地，先入應接室，由該署監獄長田種夫談話，略謂本署共有囚犯約一千八百人，内刑事犯一千五百人，軍事犯三百人，刑事犯大多由地方法院送來，軍事犯均係警備司令部及保安處送來，其囚糧待遇刑事犯與軍事犯不同，每日每客刑事犯一角，軍事犯一角五分，其所以不同之原因，陸軍部經濟校司法部充裕，此外另有外國犯二人，其因糧每日每客三角·對外國犯之優待，爲各國所同，弟（田自稱）前在哈爾濱等處任監獄職，到此接事以來僅四五月，對於軍事犯，此地向主張放任，如言語行動等太覺咆哮放浪不覊，邇來對其自由，稍事限制，是以若輩難免怨語叢生，繼則參觀監舍，舍爲特建，成齒輪形，輪軸處之一間如亭子，有八面，一面係甬道，餘七百分甲乙丙丁戊己庚，均接以十餘間監舍，看守者在中心四顧，能見各舍衖巷，其所以如此建築者，便以管理監犯故也，（一）甲監數十間，係軍事犯，未便參觀，（二）乙監數十間大半門戶洞開，門上均有番號，（囚犯不寫姓名而編號數，）至少八人至多十二人不等，至監衖底有第一工塲，爲造繩科，與糊盒科囚犯均在工作，半數造糉繩，半數糊火柴盒，管理者，監督其間，無異普通工作塲所，（三）丙監至庚監之房屋，建築相同，惟監衖底之工塲不同，如丙監衖底稱第二工塲，係印刷所，鑄字者，排印者，印刷者，裝訂者，均工作其間，毫無倦態，（四）丁監衖底係敎誨堂，設有縫紉科，揀毛科，監犯均靜坐敎誨堂，未見工作，（五）戊監衖底係第三工場，針織科，即織襪工，第四場糊盒科即糊火柴盒，第五工場織布科，監犯各在工作頗見純熟，（六）己監衖底係第六工場，搖紗科，竹木科，無甚特殊，更至女監參觀，是日計女犯共一百四十二人，大多做白竹布手帕，間有做童衣及花邊者，一若女工傳習所，察其意，似忘其身居牢獄也，（七）病監，設診察室，有藥品等設備，（八）炊場爲監犯飲食製造之所，其飯食菜疏當然粗陋簡單，不能與普通者可同日而語，然尙清潔新鮮，頗能注意衛生，另有理髮科，洗浴科等未及參觀而返云。</p>
<h3>蛙聲</h3>
<p>— 瓊</p>
<p>奶媽走了，遺留下一個剛滿週歲的小孩在我懷中哭泣。爲了要使小孩兒暫時安靜·於是我抱着他來往在這都市附近的鄕村中了。</p>
<p>這時候正是黄昏，春，還没有完全歸去，一切都還留着年青的氣象。我在這裏徘徊，我暫時的對於這幻滅的人生感覺滿足。最奇怪的便是這時小孩兒也不哭了，靜靜的諦呌着身邊嘈亂的蛙聲，到後來甚至於在我肩上睡着了。</p>
<p>啊！這蛙聲，我開始懂得這蛙聲的美麗了。但是正因此引起了我那凄凉的鄕思和往事的惆悵。</p>
<p>記得在五年前的這個時候，那時我們軍官政治學校的同學一羣正全體出發鄕村，舉行野戰。我們殺，我們衝鋒，我們在山和山的中間奔馳，我們在廣大的平原中休息。我們手裏抱着的是一枝短小的馬槍，我們的身上背着子彈。每當我們疲乏欲睡的時候，我們靜着聆着戰鼓似的蛙聲。在他們的歌聲中，全流着那種青春活潑的生命之力。不過我們究竟是非常慘酷，有幾次我們捉着幾隻連尾巴都未脫去的小小的青蛙輕便的處着死刑，因爲這種小生命的毁滅，至少在我個人的心頭就不會留下何等痕跡。的確，在那時我炫耀着自己的青春，我决心要聚着最大的力量衝出黑暗的重圍。我要爲自己謀解放，我憧憬着將來的光明。我將這枝馬槍寄托着自身的生命，我對着帝國主義以及一切敵人瞄準。</p>
<p>然而這種「力」的生活終於是夢幻似的輕輕的流過了，五年前的一切，到現在只是空虛的回憶。現在呢，我手中抱着的不是馬槍而是一個嬰孩了，我成爲</p>

<h3>徴用土地</h3>
<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>近來我們象山縣，要築一條汽車路。路線已經堪定，不日就要開工。昨天接到家裏的來信，說這條路，橫貫過我五畝的一坵田。</p>
<p>先生，這件事，當然不容我反對，但是難道我這五畝田，就此犧牲了不成？請你給我一個解釋。專此即請</p>
<p>擇安章乃文叩上</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>編者按：照現在我國法令，政府因爲要建築公路，或是其他公共建築物，必要時，得向民間徴用土地；被圈土地的業主，不得違抗，所以章君對於這件事，根本不能反對。</p>
<p>至於徴用土地，並不是說隨便佔用，政府應當參照當地情形，酌定地價。所以章君的土地，被徴用後，可以得到相當代價：不過這價格，是由官方估定，不能由你討價罷了。講到這筆地價的撥付，有的一次付現，有的分期攤付，是不一定的，不過官方事前一定有一種確切表示，各戶一律，不分軒輊。</p>
<p>你的五畝田，築了睡之後，大槪不會一點不剩。這剩下來的田，還是你的；政府除築路之外，絕對不能多圈分毫；反之，你也不能强制政府，來收買你圈剩的田。不過倘使圈剩的田，不滿一分，而且與你别處的田，不相聯絡，要是你願意的話，那末政府應當一並給價買去。徴用土地的原則，不外乎此；至於細則，那末各處不同，但總不能違此原則耳。</p>

<h3>五姬的一生（十）（續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>然而雖然如此，可是在柳姑娘却亦落得清閒：這一點是武貴非常明白的。譬如章大爺在任上海月匯五元回家，加之他在京城還有許多存欵，都可以隨時支用。所以柳姑娘到也快活，時新的衣裳，每個月可頂好的買上幾套。裏裏外外的事都有武貴承當，（她所以要帶武貴到這邊來，就是爲了這一點）她自己很可以聽聽戲，打打牌，高興的時候還可以拉拉胡琴，唱上幾句。街坊隣舍誰不羨慕她前世修到了，今世來享這樣的洪福。</p>
<p>可是不久也就漸漸的厭煩了。最使她氣憤的便是那次任上突然派一個管家回來，三更半夜的闖進她的房裏；後來據武貴猜想，大槪是大太太有意敎他這樣，來看她是不是做了壞事。這樣一來，使她不高興了好幾天。有時她打定主意一定要偷一個野男人來出出氣，但是一時總打不起這樣的興趣，一直挨到如今還没有實行。</p>
<p>今天她偶然拿着一本小說，懶懶的躺在床上。看到中間，忽然有這樣的兩句：</p>
<p>「…………你正落在幸福之中，但是你却不自覺的而給幸福疲倦了。……………」</p>
<p>於是她將書本輕輕的合上了，閉上眼皮似乎是有所沉思。</p>
<p>春天的陽光給凉風吹進窗來，熨在她的臉上，在眼角邊印成兩行淺淺的淚痕。</p>
<p>（十）現在是自己的人了</p>
<p>老天爺對於人們的作弄，常是令人哭笑皆非的。譬如柳姑娘旣然嫁到章家來了，本應當就這樣給她在和平面單純的光陰中去生活下去的，但是天老爺的意思却不是這樣，章太爺偏生在官運正紅的時候死掉了。而且死得非常奇突，據說並没有了不起的大病，只是背生了一個疔瘡，穿胸穿背的痛了三天三晚便搥胸跥足的死去了。連後事也來不及很好的吩咐，祗是敎柳姑娘必須另行改嫁。</p>
<p>據上了年紀的老公公說：這種死法，是陰司裏用稱鈎鈎着他的背脊骨，一個人做官不清是免不了會這樣的。然而也不盡然，即如武貴仁兄使說，誰也不能到陰曹地府去走上一遭，有誰見過？何况章大爺雖然是貪汚了一點，但也許不致於陷害人命，有多少做官打刦的也不見一個一個都死得乾乾淨淨。所以天老爺的事，誰也弄不清楚的。</p>
<p>不過我們的柳姑娘却從此與章家脫離關係到是眞的。第一大太太本來就看不上眼這樣得動顫·心裏想：</p>
<p>「哎！别麻煩罷，誰管得着這末多？」</p>
<p>外面仍在下着雨，悶人的雨。她茫無頭緒的深思着，她自己也有點不大清楚；爲什麽突然會變成這樣的？</p>

<h3>女明星的駐顔術</h3>
<p>— 興之</p>
<p>保持二九年華時代的妍麗</p>
<p>好萊塢有這句話：「電影演員是没有年齡的限制的·從十八歲到八十歲没有不可以做明星的·」但是這句話終究是帶着騙人的性質，試看好萊塢的許許多多電影明星，除了曼麗特蘭漱之外，誰肯在銀幕上，扮做已老的徐娘，誰不願意扮出千姣百媚好相二九年的小姑娘？雖然眞正是十八歲的很少，然而像曼麗畢克復，羅絲蔡脫登，克萊文莎ＣlaireＷhindsor，畢麗勃克，曼琳但娓絲，李琳搭熙門，葛洛里史潢生等幾個中年婦人，要是不知道她們的年齡，誰不說祇有十七八歲呢？</p>
<p>她們要立足在影界中，當然要保持她們少女時代般的妍麗，而保持少女般的妍麗·是有她們的秘術的。這不是暫時的脂粉所施成的美容術，而是永久的使皮膚不起縐紋而現出老態，雖然這「永久」，祇能保持到四十歲左右，但也是做電影演員的工作之外的主要功課。　　曼麗畢克馥的面貌身叚，可以說是明星們中間最不見老的一人，她的返少術，當然是很精的·她曾經向人說：「我相信快樂二字，是避免老的第一要素我常常今天的事今天過了再說，昨天的和明天的不去憂牠·拆穿了說，人生也不過是這麽一回事情，祗有眼前的可貴，不必多爲過去留戀或爲未來擔憂。」這個，可以說是畢克馥的哲學·畢克馥的確是好萊塢最快樂的人，誰都不能使她生氣·並且她在工作之後，必定到各處去旅行，抛開一切煩惱·所以她現在的風韻，不减當年十幾歲時候·</p>
<p>羅絲蔡脫登說：「老」是跟着心緒走的·人的心要時常放寛些。我不怕老，但是愈怕愈容易老，這是必須知道的」·羅絲是一九○九年的小明星，但現在她仍舊很年輕·</p>
<p>克萊文莎在一九二○年是好萊塢稱爲最美麗的女子，現在還是和十三年前一樣美麗，據她自己說是從來没有一次擦粉時消耗了五分鐘的·她認爲粉是毁人的容貌的東西，還有搭熙門史璜生等都是精於這個駐顔術的·</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評殊死戰ＭenＭustＦight</h3>
<p>— 周彦</p>
<p>歪曲的意識優美的技巧</p>
<p>在極端不景氣的好萊塢的現狀中，影業公司是絞盡了腦汗以求他們的生路。這部「殊死戰」就是在這種特殊的情勢中産生出來的。它以第二次世界大戰爲題材，雖然是推測的，然而正可想見他們是承認。第二次大戰的不可避免。當然在本劇中决不會主張反帝國主義的侵略戰爭，正相反，它是這殘酷戰爭的鼓動者。然而這是不是美國影片的生路呢？我們可以肯定的說是「死路」。它逃了現實，所把握的祇是夢幻，它妄想用狹義的國家觀念來發動人民參加侵略戰，唯一的藉口便是「無武力不足以言和平」。我們相信，末來的大戰决不是國家觀念所能解釋，也不是爲人道主義的非戰論所能消滅。本片中說明了鮑勃因西華氏而酷惡戰爭，後因在母親處知道了生父是爲國捐軀的烈士而又駕起飛機參戰。這顯然是最有效的麻醉劑。</p>
<p>總結的說起來，這片子的主要意義完全是炫示着美國空軍的威力，準備着和鼓動着第二次的大屠殺。</p>
<p>雖然意識上我們說它是歪曲的，但在技巧上我們不能抹殺它的成功。如天空的飛機，和紐約城的被炸，都是非常優美的畫面。雖然巨大的建築物的被毁是假的，但在畫面上一點也没有作僞的痕迹，在這裏我們不能不佩服他們光綫的巧妙。</p>
<p>演員當然要算飾羅拉的ＤianaＷynyarde爲最好，不過在後面我認爲她太年輕了，因爲經過一九一九直到一九四日前南京路中國國貨公司時裝表演中之顧梅君及胡萍一女士同坐休息時攝</p>
<p>零年，這二十多年的長時期在她臉上完全看不出年齡的增加。</p>
<p>羅拉的前夫戰死了，在抬入醫院的時候，使羅拉在不入門時發見，而由衣服的飾物上發見死者正是她的丈夫。這種精細的動作，當然是導演的聰明。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>觀「除夕」後</h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>意識是狹意的不是大衆的</p>
<p>關於本片的劇情，是利用除夕之夜十二小時中，所發生的喜怒哀樂來做精髓。這固然是很新頴的，不過因爲時間是這樣的短促，而使導演者對於片中各個人物的身世，性情，都不克有詳細的描寫。所以觀衆們所得到的不過是一點片面幻想，並没有整個的感動，闢於這一層已覺較「都市的早晨」及「城市之夜」差一籌。</p>
<p>至於關於意識方面，我們更不敢承認他是健全的。因爲在現在時代的流波中，所謂社會主義的影片，都應從個人或團體的「毅力」方面求自然的發展。决不是根據「舊道德」與「舊禮敎」的傳統思想，所能解决一切的，像本片的結束，是有一個疏財仗義的錢莊老板，拿出很多的錢來，代劉老學究還了債。不過這種仗義的人，是否每一個窮人都可遇得到的。同時這種仗義的人又是否現代社會所能有的。關於這兩點，我們可知道「除夕」的意識是狹意的，並不是大衆的，</p>
<h3>看了「除夕」之後</h3>
<p>— 馮瑛</p>
<p>導演的手段還稱高妙</p>
<p>渴望已久的除夕，終於並北京公映了，記者五時入座，却已將告滿座，在這點上，我們可以看出觀衆對於國片，已經有相當的情感。</p>
<p>該片的故事很簡單，僅僅在一天的數小時中，演出悲，歡，離，合的幾種不同喜劇罷了·</p>
<p>劇情中的討帳員告訴我們，對於富人是應該低聲氣，遇着窮漢却就當兇惡威迫的。至於收帳員爲了丢錢去投河的一節中，遇着老翁，忽然會說出「我們應應去奮鬥，打破這惡劣的環境」的話，這種在情理上是行不通的，因爲旣了解積極的奮鬭，怎爲了三百元就消極的去投河呢！</p>
<p>意義很平庸，不過導演的手段，還稱高妙，節情亦很緊凑。</p>
<p>至於演員方面，劉繼羣在如此英雄中，告訴我們是東方的哈台，這次轉變作風，無疑地是有着顯著的進步，陳燕燕在南國之春和奮鬭二片中，已給予我們深刻的認識，這次却更能盡展她藝術的天才，蔣君超表情很逼眞，餘皆稱　。</p>
<h3>「除夕」的我見</h3>
<p>— 陳本榮</p>
<p>提出幾點牽强之處</p>
<p>題名是非常優美的，但是劇本的空想和結構的勉强是很可惜的；幸而導演努力，尙不失爲一佳作·情節除評過外，尙有數點不通如左：</p>
<p>一，舞塲經理交三嫂三百元錢託買舞女，而三嫂丨一個奸滑的婦人丨竟不扣佣金付給老翁之妻；而老翁之妻丨曾取老翁當來的錢還賭債丨亦如數給老翁，不免有些矛盾了吧，</p>
<p>二，老翁之女做舞女，旣自願，又逃回，</p>
<p>三，有志的義勇少年，爲三百元錢想自殺；又對老翁說：「一切困難要努力去奮鬥」但又無辜收了老翁的錢，不加推辭，而且數目亦適合巧·</p>
<p>四，跳舞於數小時内敎授一次，即令上場，未免太快·</p>
<p>五，舞場生意甚佳，收入必好；竟欠錢莊欵項等等·</p>
<p>至於導演，的確非常盡力的；他没有使字幕解决畫面的難點，技巧方面：如老翁還富太太錢時十足的特寫；和老翁家中茶壺無茶等；是很好的，主角以陳燕燕劉繼羣最佳；配角以邢少梅較好，這片完全是夜景，但老翁家的灶間，不免太亮；雪地像眞，而下雪則全是紙片等小錯處；要請以後出品避免牠才好。</p>
<h3>觀了「除夕」後</h3>
<p>— 喻家卿</p>
<p>使我發現了一顆新星</p>
<p>「除夕」是描寫窮人過年關的「苦處」和「難處，」故事的大體是述一個老翁在除夕的那一天，因爲被許多的討賬人威逼，而他的妻子把一個女兒押賣給舞塲做舞女，不料舞塲的經理虐待她，欺侮她，她萬不得意，仍舊逃到家裏，後來老翁因爲救了一個少年之急，最後少年和錢莊經理來解了老翁的窮圍。</p>
<p>演員如劉繼羣已完全改變作風，没有一些滑稽的性質，陳燕燕的表演比以前所表演的動作，頗覺狠有進步，蔣君超在本片表演最有成績的一個，我說他將要是在電影界中佔據一個重要的地位，也就是一九三三年的新明星，其餘演員，都没有特殊的表演。</p>

<p>「對不起，恩納斯篤」，她見他面有不愉之色，便趕快抱歉着說。「對不起，父親。」她坐回去了，她兩隻纖纖的手抱住胸脯，似乎要把這過眼的樂趣緊留在心頭。</p>

Tian has raised tens of millions of yuan, and despite being an army commander and provincial committee member, he remains greedy and insatiable, plotting to seize the position of provincial government chairman. The street fighting in Chengdu resulted in tens of thousands of military and civilian deaths, and tens of millions of yuan in property damage. However, Tian retreated to the Northern Route and apportioned the loss donation of over two million yuan to Fanghu. Tongjiang, Nanjiang, and Bazhong counties have suffered natural disasters for years, with harvests less than 20-30%. People reduce their food and clothing, and suffer from hunger and cold. However, tax payments cannot be avoided in the slightest, and any slight delay results in beatings. He also established a bank to provide loans to the people, with interest rates more than three times the principal. Last winter, the people of the three counties formed a kneeling and crying group, but Tian accused them of gathering a crowd and ordered the Nanjiang County Magistrate to kill dozens of people. The Tongjiang County Magistrate announced that the levy was an order from the army commander and must be paid even if it meant killing people. As a result, the Red bandits took the opportunity to enter directly, and the poor people of Tongjiang responded in succession. Tian then used the excuse of suppressing bandits to levy another 5-6 million yuan in anti-Red bandit donations in the defense area. In reality, the bandit forces are stronger than before, and internal chaos is more prevalent than before, all caused by the exploitation of the people. For the sake of the safety of Northern Sichuan and the lives and property of the people, besides requesting the central government to dismiss Tian and severely punish him, and to appoint virtuous officials to maintain local order, there is no other way.

<h3>The Enemy Crosses the Luan River, Tianjin and Beijing Are in Danger</h3>
<p>— In Reality</p>
<p>Japan's invasion of our Northeast initially relied on economic weapons, focusing on market development and expanding the control of financial capital. In recent years, as the global economic panic has worsened and various countries have implemented protectionism, striving for so-called self-sufficiency, Japanese imperialists, under the guise of self-defense, have recklessly undermined our country's independence and used "anti-communism" as a pretext to confuse the great powers and gain international sympathy. If our country had fought resolutely during the September 18th Incident, even if we had failed, it would have been nothing more than international mediation, offering the five railways in the Northeast as a sacrifice. At most, Japan would have monopolized the transportation business in the Northeast and lost some economic power. The losses from defeat could still be remedied. Alternatively, we could have taken the path of direct negotiation, and the losses would have been no more than that. However, our country procrastinated between peace and war, mistakenly believing that the League of Nations had the power to restrain Japan. By the time the enemy became strong, not only had the Northeast fallen, but Rehe had also been ravaged. Japan's so-called continental policy is the last trick of the militarists to save the economic panic. Little did they know that the more military actions expanded, the more difficult the finances became, and the more profound the economic panic became. Thus, the military aggression became more and more endless. Therefore, when they attacked Shenyang, their purpose was only to gain economic rights in the Northeast. After Liaoning and Jilin were in Japanese hands, Heilongjiang, Jinzhou, and Shanhaiguan fell one after another. Rehe, with an area of 580,000 square miles, was completely occupied by the enemy. Although our voices of resistance rose into the clouds, the actual strength shown was very weak. Thus, the enemy advanced more easily, approaching the Great Wall in one fell swoop, and then occupying Eastern Luan. Now, they have crossed the Luan River to the west, passing through Gubeikou to spy on Miyun, and forcing towards Fengrun in the east. Their surging momentum threatens to shake Tianjin and Beijing and disturb Hebei.</p>
<p>Although our country is poor and our resources are exhausted today, and we have not prepared in advance, we have a large population and a vast land, and the general public has the characteristic of being able to endure hardship, which surpasses all other countries in the world. What we lack is strong leadership and fair and rigorous organization. If our country could fight Japan, we only need to continue to advance fiercely and fight hard. Even if we lose one or two or even three or four provinces due to defeat, there is absolutely nothing to worry about. First, we can take this opportunity to revitalize our country's decadent customs. Second, we can strengthen domestic unity. Third, we can encourage the morale of the whole country. Victory or defeat is common for soldiers. It depends on the final battle and the outcome of the last five minutes. Moreover, Japanese militarists are like the setting sun in terms of historical relations. Although they are very beautiful, their time is not long. In fact, the internal contradictions of their country are gradually unfolding, and with the urging of war, their intensification will be even more rapid. Therefore, even if we make huge sacrifices, we will use this unprecedented price to exert our final strength and engage in a broad and long-term national struggle. We will eventually be able to open up a bright path and gain the final victory.</p>
<p>Judging from the external situation, there are many disputes between countries, and our country seems inevitable to be isolated internationally. However, we must also eliminate dependence and not be discouraged by the bleak future. We must seek self-reliance. Moreover, today's failure lays the foundation for future success. In addition to recognizing the true face of the enemy and striving to fight, we must also encourage the whole country, arouse the masses, and promote the spirit of our 400 million people to strive for self-salvation. We must grieve the failures of the past and plan for the salvation of the future. Our country's existing land still exceeds 25 million square miles, and the accumulation of all natural forces is still twice that of the whole of Europe. Although we are now trapped by the invasion of Japanese capitalists, if our masses can truly awaken, there is still much that can be done. It is not impossible to reverse this decline. May our compatriots actively rise up and sacrifice the individual to exchange for the permanent life of the nation.</p>

<h3>The Soviet Union Prepares a Written Reply to Our Protest</h3>
<p>Sino-Russian Commercial Treaty Temporarily Shelved</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Soviet Union wants to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs has protested. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ambassador Yan Huiqing sent the written protest to Karakhan on the 15th. Karakhan replied that he would study our protest and then reply in writing. After the resumption of Sino-Russian diplomatic relations, it was originally planned to continue negotiations on the commercial treaty, but now it will be temporarily shelved due to the Chinese Eastern Railway issue. (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>

<h3>The British House of Commons Questions the Use of Funds from the Beining Railway</h3>
<p>(London) Conservative MP Moray-Carey stated in the House of Commons today that the Chinese government had withdrawn more than four million yuan from the revenue of the Beining Railway. This fund should have been used to repay debts. Therefore, he asked Foreign Secretary Simon to negotiate with China and inform them that if revenue designated for debt repayment is used for other purposes, China's credit will not be restored. Simon replied that he had seriously negotiated with the Chinese government and pointed out the impact of this action on credit. (Reuters, 15th)</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Enhances Its Diplomatic and Military Position Against China in the Future</h3>
<p>The Departure of Arita and the Appointment of Shigemitsu, a Hardliner, Signifies a Victory for the Hardliners, Who Will Intensify Military Aggression in North China and Force Us to Sign a Peace Treaty</p>
<p>Ugaki, the Governor-General of Korea, Will Return to Tokyo Next Monday, and It Is Expected That There Will Be Changes in the Future of Japanese Politics</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Taking advantage of the resignation of Vice Minister Arita and the vacancy of the Japanese Ambassador to Turkey after Yoshida's death, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will change important positions within the ministry. All important positions will be filled by hardliners. The current diplomatic strategy is to abandon the extreme policies towards Europe and the United States and concentrate all efforts on attacking our country. Those who currently wield the real power of Japanese diplomacy are still the military warlords under the Araki faction. Uchida, Shigemitsu, Obata, Tani, and Shiratori are merely willing to be the mouthpieces of the Araki faction. The recent strategy of the Japanese military towards China is simply to force peace through war. It is said that the specific methods are: (1) To intensify the invasion of North China, causing internal divisions in our country, blockading our North China ports by force, and carrying out compulsory trade to remedy its domestic economic panic, eliminate the tide of resistance to Japanese goods, and force our financial and economic situation into an unmanageable situation, thereby coercing our government to sign a treaty of betrayal. (2) To actively provoke the southwestern generals and politicians to oppose the central government, not only preventing the central government from fully responding to the Japanese army but also helping to cause our country's civil war. (China United Press, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida appointed Minister Shigemitsu as Vice Minister Arita's successor because Japanese diplomacy after withdrawing from the League of Nations will focus on the China issue. If China does not reflect and maintain the status quo, the unrest in North China will increase, and peace in East Asia will be worrying. Therefore, in order to create a new Sino-Japanese relationship, Japan needs to actively start activities. Therefore, Foreign Minister Uchida previously placed Ambassador Obata in the position of Foreign Minister's advisor and increased the number of personnel in the Asia Bureau to enhance diplomacy towards China. This time, he reappointed Shigemitsu, making Ambassador Obata, who is proficient in Chinese affairs, and Vice Minister Shigemitsu participate in the hardline faction of Asia Bureau Director Tani and Information Minister Shiratori. So far, Uchida's diplomatic lineup towards China is complete, and only future activities are expected. (Dentsu News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Shigemitsu Aoi, told someone that he has not yet received the official appointment letter, so he cannot make any announcements. Once appointed, he will definitely serve with one leg. At present, there is no problem other than the leg, and he can do the job. (Dentsu News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Uchida initially recommended Vice Minister Arita as the ambassador to Turkey, but Arita firmly declined and was dismissed at his request, retiring from the diplomatic world. As a result, the position of ambassador to Turkey will be succeeded by Mushatoji, the minister to Sweden. It is expected that the diplomatic world will take this opportunity to make major changes. (Dentsu News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) General Ugaki Kazushige, the Governor-General of Korea, is scheduled to return to Tokyo from Seoul on the 22nd. Although Ugaki's trip is said to be to discuss next year's budget, it is widely believed to be closely related to the future of the political situation. It is still questionable whether Ugaki can succeed Saito in governing, but the current situation has indeed turned in favor of Ugaki. The reasons are as follows: (1) A dozen or so members of the Seiyukai, from the Kuhara and Tokonami factions, secretly gathered somewhere on the afternoon of the 8th and decided to oppose a political coup and oppose Suzuki taking power. The Suzuki faction was very embarrassed upon receiving the news and has sent a leader to persuade Finance Minister Takahashi not to resign. A successor cabinet would be unfavorable to Suzuki and favorable to Ugaki. (2) The financial community and senior officials in the Imperial Court are very wary of Hiranuma, and Hiranuma has no party support. Only the Kokumin Domei is sending overtures, but it cannot have an effect in politics. Ugaki has the support of the Minseito and the anti-Suzuki faction of the Seiyukai, and the Kokumin Domei cannot oppose Ugaki taking power. (3) The hardline faction still dominates the Japanese political situation internally. The forced resignation of Arita, the vice minister of foreign affairs and relative of Seiyukai leader Yamamoto Jotaro, is also evidence of this. (China United Press, 16th)</p>
<h3>Araki Reports on the Situation in North China at the Cabinet Meeting</h3>

Song's mission in the United States will be completed soon, and he is scheduled to take a ship from the United States to England at the end of the month to attend the World Economic Conference. (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The selection of the members of the U.S. delegation to the World Economic Conference, which will open in London on June 12, is said to have been provisionally determined by President Roosevelt as follows: Secretary of State Hull, former Secretary of War Baker, former Governor of Ohio Cox, famous financier Baruch, and Senator Pittman.

<h3>A Pseudo-Organization Expels a British Reporter from the Country</h3>
<p>Simpson Ordered to Temporarily Seek Refuge in the Consulate</p>
<p>To Await Instructions from the British Government</p>
<p>(Harbin) British journalist Simpson is taking refuge in the British consulate today, but the "Manchukuo" authorities still insist on Simpson's expulsion from the country, threatening that if their request is not met, they will resort to legitimate force, implying that they will use harsh means to force Simpson out of the consulate. However, it remains doubtful whether this threat will materialize. The British position is that Manchuria is part of China, and although the current situation is beyond China's control, British people in Manchuria still enjoy extraterritorial rights. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The British Minister to China, Lampson, ordered Simpson, the chief writer of the English newspaper in this area, to reside in the consulate to await the British government's decision on the "Manchukuo" order to expel Simpson. According to reports, the "Manchukuo" authorities recently accused Simpson of publishing anti-"Manchu" articles in the newspaper and demanded that he leave the country within a week, otherwise he would be deported. Today is the deadline, and the police have issued an arrest warrant, but the "Manchukuo" authorities may not dare to enter the British embassy to arrest him. (Reuters, 16th)</p>

<h3>Disarmament Is at a Critical Juncture</h3>
<p>The German Situation Again Causes Tension in Europe and the United States, and Roosevelt Issues a Declaration to Influence the Situation</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th: The recent developments in Germany have caused unrest in Europe and the United States. French newspapers speculate that the statements made by German Vice-Chancellor Papen yesterday are a prelude to Hitler's speech in the Reichstag on Wednesday. The extremely conservative French Action Française newspaper said that Papen's words have explained, admitted, and announced the policies that Germany has pursued for the past fifteen years. American confidence in the World Economic Conference has been shaken by German rhetoric on war, the stagnation of the Geneva Disarmament Conference, the possibility of major changes in Danzig, and the ambitions of the Hitler faction in Austria. The British reaction to recent events in Germany can also be seen in the criticism of The Times, which said that before demanding that other countries disarm, it is best to condemn Hitler's main goal of preparing Germany for a war of revenge.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 15th: President Roosevelt will issue a very important declaration on Tuesday, explaining U.S. policy in order to use world public opinion to timely offset the impact of German Chancellor Hitler's speech in the Reichstag on Wednesday. The U.S. President hopes to preserve the Disarmament Conference and pave the way to the World Economic Conference with his declaration. It is expected that this declaration will detail the principles regarding European relations, such as the Monroe Doctrine, but it is also expected that the U.S. President will declare that the United States is prepared to (1) consult with other countries in the event of a danger of war, (2) participate in appropriate security measures, and (3) advocate disarmament in accordance with the scope contained in the plan of British Prime Minister MacDonald.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Berlin, 16th: The official document on the German disarmament issue was released today, accusing other countries of trying to undermine the Disarmament Conference on the issue of a unified army system in order to avoid approaching the second point, namely material disarmament, and stating the necessity of Germany's demand for equality. The document compares other countries' active arms race with the fact that German armories are empty, and asks whether it is wise to prematurely acknowledge new responsibilities without making concessions. German Chancellor Hitler will meet with President Hindenburg today, presumably to discuss his important speech in the Reichstag tomorrow with the President.</p>
<p>▲ National Daily, Geneva, 15th: At this time, many representatives to the Disarmament Conference have considered postponing all disarmament discussions to promote the progress of the Economic Conference, but if German Chancellor Hitler insists on promising Germany to rearm, there may be a need to take other procedures. According to several representatives, if Hitler announces after the opening of the Reichstag on Wednesday that Germany is determined to arm its troops (Germany is currently restricted in military strength and some major armaments, so in technical terms it is called disarmed), it is expected that the former Allied powers may individually or jointly submit the matter to the League of Nations Executive Council. However, other representatives believe that there is still an opportunity to break the current deadlock and that the situation will not necessarily reach this extreme. According to news from major financial countries, the uncertainty in the disarmament situation has already had a negative impact on commerce, but there is unlikely to be any progress in the situation before the German Reichstag meets on Wednesday. Hitler has prepared a declaration detailing Germany's attitude on the Disarmament Conference issue, which will be read in the Reichstag and passed, but there is currently no indication whether its content will advise Germany to overstep the provisions of the treaty.</p>
<h3>American and British Attitudes</h3>
<p>▲ Reuters, Washington, 15th: When Secretary of State Hull was asked today to elaborate on the speech by German Vice-Chancellor Papen and the situation of the Disarmament Conference, Hull's office replied only that it was not appropriate for officials to rush to discuss the matter before it had reached a definite stage. He also said that he had not received Davis' report on the newspaper report that the United Kingdom, the United States, and France had reached a compromise and planned to jointly advise Germany not to act rashly.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th: British Foreign Secretary Simon hopes to personally go to Geneva to represent the British government at the important meeting on Thursday, because the future of the Disarmament Conference depends on this meeting. However, Simon's health is not good. If he cannot bear the fatigue of the journey, he will be represented by Secretary of War Hailsham. Hailsham recently made statements about adopting possible sanctions against Germany, which have provoked a strong response from German Vice-Chancellor Papen.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, London, 15th: According to recent news, neither Foreign Secretary Simon nor Secretary of War Hailsham plans to go to Geneva on Wednesday. Therefore, Eden, the British representative who is currently in London, will return to Geneva with cabinet instructions to participate in the meeting on Thursday, because Eden has gained the cabinet's full trust in handling all matters as the British representative in Geneva.</p>
<p>▲ Reuters, Geneva, 15th: In view of the precarious fate of the Disarmament Conference, British representative Eden set off for London tonight to report the current situation to the British government. Eden will return to Geneva to participate in the important discussions scheduled for Thursday.</p>
<h3>Franco-American Liaison</h3>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 16th: According to the Daily News, when U.S. representative to the Disarmament Conference Davis met with Foreign Minister Pongue yesterday, Pongue said that Germany had indeed begun to rearm, and various weapons prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles were being manufactured openly. Pongue and Davis seemed to have considered sanctions against this act of violating the treaty. Before the sanctions, or jointly protest to Germany as a warning.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 15th: U.S. disarmament representative Davis met with Foreign Minister Pongue at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for an hour. The topics discussed were particularly the resumption of the Disarmament Conference on Thursday and the World Economic Conference. Regarding the Economic Conference, Davis only asked the French authorities to clarify France's reservations on the tariff truce. Davis had talks in London on the situation created by Germany's recent attitude towards disarmament, seeking to bring the opinions of the United Kingdom and the United States closer on the issue of disarmament. Davis reported the results of his talks to Pongue. Davis also said that Germany's demands for disarmament were of great concern to the United States. He was eager to know the details of Hitler's speech to be delivered in the House of Representatives. He believed that the three democratic countries of the United Kingdom, the United States, and France should unite to cope with the current difficulties. Davis had repeatedly mentioned these points to Pongue. At the general committee meeting on Thursday, it is expected that the representatives of the United Kingdom, France, and the United States will explain the opinions of their respective governments. This declaration must be based on the principles jointly decided by Davis during his recent talks in London and Paris.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Paris, 15th: After meeting with French Foreign Minister Pongue, U.S. disarmament representative Davis told people that the three issues discussed today were the London World Economic Conference, the Disarmament Conference, and the future events that everyone is waiting for. Regarding the first matter, he said that the situation was quite chaotic. Regarding the Disarmament Conference, the meeting had already stopped. As for future events, he was referring to Hitler's speech to be delivered to the House of Representatives. Davis also said that he was scheduled to go to Geneva on Wednesday evening.</p>
<p>▲ Havas, Geneva, 16th: The foreign ministers of the Little Entente countries held a meeting to exchange views on the progress of the Disarmament Conference and to discuss methods of intervention. The foreign ministers also drafted a procedure for the Economic Conference of the Little Entente countries.</p>
<h3>German Situation</h3>
<p>▲ Berlin, 15th (National Telegram) German Chancellor Hitler has returned to Berlin from Bavaria. During his weekend vacation, Hitler prepared a speech on German international diplomacy to be delivered in the Reichstag on Wednesday. Many foreign reporters said that all members of the Social Democratic Party would not attend the Reichstag meeting. In fact, this news is not accurate. Not only will they attend the meeting, but they will also join the debate. Ambassador Nadolny, the current German representative to the Disarmament Conference, has also returned from Geneva to Germany and is preparing to participate in various important meetings. Significant developments are expected at that time.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, 16th (Havas) Nadolny, the chief German representative to the Disarmament Conference, returned to the country to report to the government on the situation of the Disarmament Conference. After Chancellor Hitler delivers a speech in the Reichstag on Wednesday, he will immediately depart for Geneva.</p>
<p>▲ Berlin, 15th (Reuters) The national atmosphere was quite shaken at the end of last week, but now the newspapers are not as concerned about the foreign political situation as before. This is probably because Chancellor Hitler will deliver a speech in the Reichstag on Wednesday to announce Germany's policies. However, the Deutsche Tageszeitung published a lengthy article today stating that war is no longer an issue because no country can benefit from it, and Germany is particularly at risk of being attacked by France and Poland. The article also stated that it would be too uneconomical for the United Kingdom and the United States to engage in such a war, and they would definitely not do so. Although France harbors extravagant hopes of contending for power, it will eventually face retribution for engaging in a war that is without honor or meaning, and it should not be so blind as to be unaware of this.</p>
<h3>The Danzig Question</h3>
<p>▲ London, 15th (Reuters) During today's meeting of the House of Commons, a request was made to the Foreign Secretary to send a cruiser to Danzig to prevent incidents during the election. The Foreign Secretary replied that he saw no reason to send a ship. He also stated that he had recently met with the senior official stationed in Danzig, who said that the alarming news circulating outside about the possibility of serious disturbances during this election was not credible. After occupying the trade union headquarters, the Danzig National Socialist Party suddenly became moderate. Today, several of its leaders visited the senior official and expressed their willingness to get along with Poland in peace, saying that if the National Socialist Party wins this election, the party's administrative policy will be pro-Polish, ensuring the safety of Polish lives and property, strictly abiding by the existing treaties, and absolutely adhering to the Danzig Constitution guaranteed by the League of Nations.</p>
<p>▲ Danzig, 15th (National Telegram) The leader of the National Socialist Party here, Forster, issued a declaration to the League of Nations' senior official in Danzig, Rosting, today, stating that if the Danzig National Socialist Party takes over the government, it intends to cooperate with the Polish people in peace and will do its best to guarantee the safety of Polish lives and property. The National Socialist Party is determined to maintain the existing treaties and intends to strictly abide by the Constitution guaranteed by the League of Nations. It is reported that the senior official has accepted this declaration and considers it satisfactory.</p>
<p>▲ Geneva, 15th (National Telegram) In recent months, the Free City of Danzig has filed no less than 106 cases with the Council of the League of Nations, complaining about Polish encroachment, all of which are awaiting the Council's decision. This proves the severity of the discord between Danzig and Poland.</p>
<p>▲ Danzig, 16th (National Telegram) The Polish government has recently issued a new order that will greatly impact trade between the Free City of Danzig and Poland. The new order stipulates that from May 15th, goods transported from Danzig to Poland will have to be returned at the border if they are not stamped by Polish customs officials, and even luggage will have to be stamped. The new order was issued suddenly without prior notice, causing great consternation in the Danzig business community.</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Will Issue a Declaration Explaining the New U.S. International Policy</h3>
<p>No Longer Adopting a Hands-Off Approach to the European Situation, Seeking to Save the Fate of Disarmament and Promote the Success of the Economic Conference</p>
<p>(Paris) After serious developments in the German political situation, it is reported that the U.S. representative, Davis, has told President Roosevelt to immediately issue a declaration stating the importance of the United States directly paying attention to European peace. The U.S. side points to this as a sign that the United States will abandon the Monroe Doctrine and adopt a new international policy. Since yesterday, the situation has completely changed, and the remarks that the United Kingdom and France had already prepared to present at the Geneva Disarmament Conference on Thursday will be greatly revised due to the remarks of the U.S. President today and Hitler tomorrow. It is reported that France approves of the U.S. issuing a moderate declaration to Germany (Reuters, 16th).</p>
<p>(Washington) The deadlock in the Disarmament Conference has a great and profound impact on the Economic Conference, so the anxiety of the U.S. officialdom is even greater than that of the European executives. It is reported that those close to the President expect the U.S. President to issue a broad and passionate declaration, stating the U.S. policy regarding European peace, which is expected to be released around Tuesday. The content is expected to announce the U.S. President's efforts to save the Disarmament Conference in order to promote the success of the Economic Conference. However, there are also those who anticipate that the President will go a step further and request that France and Germany maintain peace. According to private telegrams from the representative stationed in Europe, Davis, Davis advised the President that the United States can no longer take a hands-off policy on the disarmament issue and must clearly state its position. Therefore, those who are generally well-informed expect that the opinions expressed by the U.S. President tonight will be similar to those of the United Kingdom and will have a large part similar to France. It is reported that the U.S. President has studied the issue of imposing sanctions against aggressors and is expected to announce that the United States is willing to fully join the consultation pact proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald. Those who claim to know the President's attitude even say that the President will support commercial sanctions and not advocate the use of force, at least not willing to use U.S. troops to subdue aggressors. However, if the President's declaration is as expected by some people, openly requesting that France and Germany maintain peace, then the situation must already be very serious, causing the President to believe that the two countries are on the verge of open rupture. According to reports received by the White House and the State Department, all of Europe is currently in suspicion and has a tendency to split into two major factions: Italy, Germany, and Austria form one faction and receive assistance from Austria. They observe every move of France, Poland, and their allies with suspicion. Conversely, France, Poland, and the Little Entente oppose all actions to revise the peace treaty. Among the major powers, only the United Kingdom and the United States are not shrouded in this atmosphere of suspicion. If this situation continues, the World Economic Conference will have little hope of complete success. Therefore, the United States has a need to come up with a plan to save the situation. It is now expected that when the U.S. President issues a declaration, what he agreed with British Prime Minister MacDonald a few days ago can also be released, and the State Department has already stated that the United States does not approve of Germany's large-scale rearmament (National Telegram, 15th).</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, U.S. President Roosevelt assumed the role of world leader, inviting all countries to guarantee not to send armed forces across borders and requesting the entire world to accept British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament proposal. In this declaration of the U.S. policy on European peace, the U.S. President also warned the world that in this time of crisis, if any strong country refuses to clearly register its opposition to aggressive behavior, then the world will know who is to blame for the disasters that will befall. I urge all countries not to bear this responsibility. The U.S. President subsequently urged all countries to accept British Prime Minister MacDonald's disarmament plan as the first step towards avoiding war, as the plan will substantially reduce aggressive weapons and establish a consultation system that can bring together countries to seek remedies when world peace is threatened. In addition, the U.S. President also proposed that while starting the machinery to make the world accept the British plan, existing troops and armaments should not be increased, and countries should solemnly guarantee not to increase their war-making tools. The Americans have always been determined to refuse to be bound by consultation agreements. This declaration by the U.S. President is a sign of a major change in U.S. foreign policy (National Telegram, 15th).</p>
<h3>Major Reorganization of the U.S. Navy</h3>
<p>One-Third of Warships Will Rotate on Leave, and All Will Be Deployed in Formations After Three Years</p>
<p>(Preparation for the Pacific War)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, U.S. Navy Commander-in-Chief Rear Admiral Blythe ordered that one-third of warships be withdrawn from the fleet as reserve ships starting July 1st, and announced that the number of naval personnel will also be reduced by 2,000. Senior naval officers were surprised by this news, believing that if one-third of the warships are placed in idleness, they will not be able to maintain proper effectiveness. However, Blythe said that the ships will be rotated on leave, which will not affect the effectiveness of the navy. It is now determined that the ships to be withdrawn from the fleet on July 1st include five battleships, five heavy cruisers, three light cruisers, thirty-three destroyers, sixteen submarines, one aircraft carrier, and two light mine-laying boats. These warships will be idle for six months before being redeployed into the fleet to replace other ships. This rotation will continue until January 1, 1936, when all warships will be redeployed in formations. In the next two and a half years, the number of ships in formation will be only ten battleships, ten heavy cruisers, seven light cruisers, sixty destroyers, and some submarines and aircraft carriers. However, according to this plan, in case of emergency, the idle ships can still be immediately deployed into the fleet because each ship only rests for six months out of ten months and is repaired in docks during the rest period. They can still be deployed at any time when needed, so there is actually not much loss in naval effectiveness. The naval airship Macon is not included in the rotation and will always be deployed in the fleet (National Telegram, 15th).</p>

<h3>Public Telegram</h3>
<p>Deng Xihou sends a telegram to the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Ministers of various Yuan, Nanchang Chairman Jiang Junjian, Provincial Governments of various provinces, General Commanders of various routes, Army Commanders of various armies, Party Headquarters at all levels, Chongqing Supervisor Liu, Division Commander Ji, Division Commander Luo, Suiding Army Commander Liu, Guang'an Army Commander Yang, Tongchuan Supervisor Tian, Brigade Commanders of various divisions, Commanders of various units, County Magistrates of various counties, various agencies and legal entities, and various newspapers:</p>
<p>I, Xihou, received a telegram from Chairman Jiang during the winter, instructing me to assist in suppressing the Red bandits and avoid repeating the mistakes of Hubei and Jiangxi. I followed the order and left the province on a certain date, personally inspecting the troops in the garrison area to make selections. I have already reported these matters separately. Later, upon arriving in Xindu, I received another telegram from the Chairman on the 30th, instructing that units that have not participated in the bandit suppression should be quickly selected to reinforce the five provinces. It is inappropriate to take advantage of the situation to occupy defensive positions and cause internal strife, creating opportunities for the bandits.</p>
<p>I, Xihou, strictly followed the telegram's instructions and was in the midst of inspecting and selecting troops in Xindu when I suddenly received a report from the troops stationed in Wenjiang that Liu Wenhui, the army commander of the 24th Army, had dispatched troops in two directions to pressure Wenjiang on a certain day. I ordered them to retreat to avoid war. On another day, they forced our troops stationed in Jianyang to leave the city and occupied it exclusively. In recent days, they have further forcibly occupied our Chengdu tax collection agencies, an endless and aggressive grab.</p>
<p>I, Xihou, while retreating, still made efforts to mediate and sent a telegram to the Central Government to stop them and order them to reflect. However, Liu Wenhui has no remorse and on the first day of the year, he divided his troops into four routes and launched a major attack on our Peng, Guan, Xindu, Jintang, and Ziyang counties. This is taking an inch and demanding a yard, and retreat is no longer possible.</p>
<p>Considering that the Communist bandits are rampant and spreading in Sichuan, causing concern in the Central Government, which has repeatedly ordered that there should be no distinction in territory and that troops should be dispatched to assist in suppressing the bandits, I, Xihou, had just begun selecting troops when Liu Wenhui repeatedly started conflicts with me, seemingly deliberately echoing the Red bandits, preventing me, Xihou, from participating in the bandit suppression work. This is in direct contradiction to Chairman Jiang's repeated telegrams not to occupy defensive positions and cause internal strife.</p>
<p>It is unbelievable that Liu Wenhui, holding the position of chairman, has shown no achievement in governance and has created obstacles in bandit suppression, disregarding what is right, undermining the Sichuan situation, and being heartless and unjust to this extent. It is truly lamentable.</p>
<p>I believe that the turmoil in Sichuan cannot be resolved by military force, as the Central Government has already declared and the people have appealed. This sentiment and reason are shared by the entire nation. The sacrifices in last year's battles were greater than in the past, but what was gained in return? At a time when the wounds have not yet healed, the violent Japanese are approaching Tianjin and the Red bandits are still harassing the northern routes. Even striving for relief is barely enough. If we still act recklessly and start wars, what is the point?</p>
<p>If there is still a glimmer of hope and a shred of conscience, how can one bear to do this? If we disregard national difficulties and common suffering, and instead engage in petty squabbles and ruthless abuse of the people, then even though I, Xihou, love peace and can endure humiliation, it is difficult to suppress the anger of my subordinates and prevent legitimate defense.</p>
<p>I request the Central Government to uphold the law and maintain justice, severely punishing Liu Wenhui for starting a war and ruining the region without cause. I also hope that all gentlemen will uphold justice and speak out, restraining tyranny so that those who love to create chaos will be warned and the bandit suppression work can proceed. I anxiously await your orders.</p>
<p>Deng Xihou, Army Commander of the 28th Army of the National Revolutionary Army and concurrently General Commander of the 14th Route, bows in respect.</p>

<h3>American Striking Farmers Publicly Fight with Police</h3>
<p>Using Bricks and Stones as Weapons</p>
<p>Tear Gas Ineffective</p>
<p>Forcefully Occupy Pundor Town</p>
<p>▲ National News Agency, Milwaukee, 15th - American striking farmers openly fought with state police today in the Green Bay area, one hundred miles north of here. According to the latest news, the farmers were victorious and occupied the small town of Pundor. Initially, about 1,000 striking farmers guarded the main roads outside Pundor, intercepting vehicles and trains transporting agricultural products. If the drivers resisted, they were dragged to nearby fields and guarded.</p>
<p>Minutes after the incident, tax collectors and road police arrived and fired tear gas bombs, but the farmers had already brought bricks and stones in their cars. Bricks and pointed sticks flew at the police, who were unable to resist and were forced to retreat. The farmers then destroyed the milk and dairy products in the vehicles, swarmed into the town, beat up councilors, and occupied the entire town.</p>
<p>Most retail stores are now closed, but the strikers are still swarming into creameries, smashing their vats and pouring the finished goods into the streets. Factory employees were unable to stop them because the strikers had sent pickets into the city in advance to investigate places storing large quantities of butter and cheese. Therefore, places with more inventory were destroyed today, and places with less inventory were not invaded, but deliveries were also prohibited. Local merchants have urgently telegraphed Madison City, requesting the authorities to quickly send state troops to suppress the unrest.</p>
<h3>Notes from the War Zone</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent Geng Ya of This Newspaper</p>
<p>(Defensive Engineering Abandoned Like Worn-Out Shoes)</p>
<p>(The Enemy's Means Are Insidious and Despicable)</p>
<p>Guye Special Dispatch. The Japanese, in order to satisfy their aggressive ambitions of "not giving up until they reach the Yellow River," have repeatedly used their familiar trick of deceiving themselves and others, and at the beginning of the month, they fabricated excuses to confuse the international community. On the 7th, they restarted the Luan River incident, suddenly capturing the counties and towns of Funing, Shuangwangbao, Lulong, and Qian'an on the eastern section of the Pingyu Avenue. Along the Beining Railway, they also occupied Beidaihe, Liushouying, and Changli, and even advanced to the positions of Anshan, Jingjiadianzi, Liguan, and Shimen stations.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the bad news spread that the enemy had forcibly crossed the Luan River and broken through the Gaotaizi defense line of Commander Song’s army, extending over two hundred li. A certain place west of the Luan River on the left wing of Commander He’s army was in danger of being encircled by the enemy. Senior officers of the army headquarters immediately held an emergency meeting to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<p>At 7 p.m., I visited Army Commander He Zhuguo, who said, "The Japanese are so rampant. If the country does not coordinate measures, the future is very dangerous. The key areas of Xifengkou and Gubeikou, which we are now defending, are extremely important. If anything unexpected happens again, Tianjin will have no defenses to rely on." He also gave me two photos of shot-down Japanese planes.</p>
<p>Then, I visited Hong Sheng, the magistrate of Luan County, and inquired about the people's situation after the county fell into the war zone. After saying goodbye, it was already 9 p.m. When I returned, I saw a service member from the adjutant's office packing boxes and luggage. Surprised, I asked, and learned that the army headquarters was about to move to a certain place. I also hastily left the city. The moonlight was bleak, and I felt gloomy. Modern women, petite and exquisite, were hurrying along the sandy path, accompanied by soldiers carrying boxes and bags. I guessed they were the families of officers, but I couldn't be sure.</p>
<p>After arriving at the station and waiting for a while, the train arrived and we eagerly boarded. The train had no roof, so I looked up at the stars and moon and down at the people. The sights and sounds from the front line came flooding into my mind. I remember when I rode with the propaganda team along the Luan River defense line to give speeches in various villages, I saw that our riverfront positions were quite strong, but because they had not been repaired for a long time, the wooden frames had sprouted and branched out, and the trenches were filled with wind and sand.</p>
<p>As the train started, it traveled north over the Luan River railway bridge. The peaks turned and the road twisted. Above were hanging cliffs, and below was the Luan River. The scenery was serene. The Qianlong Imperial Palace was in sight. When we arrived at Liugezhuang, the propaganda team members gave speeches everywhere. I happened to meet a platoon leader who had just withdrawn from the front line to defend this place.</p>
<p>He said that the positions and bunkers built by our army in Shimenzhai, Haiyangzhen, Qinhuangdao, Niutouguan, Liujiang, and other places were strongly built with lime, fine stone, and huge timber, and strengthened with barbed wire and various obstacles, costing three or four hundred thousand yuan. The cost of the timber was not included. It was very difficult to build during the severe cold. It was hard to dig into the frozen ground even an inch. We painstakingly built these defenses, originally intending to defend them to the death, but when Lengkou fell, an order came out and we retreated. The positions created with blood, sweat, and money were mostly not reused and abandoned like worn-out shoes. This is extremely painful.</p>
<p>After the non-resistance general stepped down and the superiors changed, our soldiers all rejoiced and said that the opportunity to bravely kill the enemy had arrived. However, the enemy restarted the conflict this time, and our soldiers were sharpening their fists and vowing to fight to the death. As a result, their hearts and wishes were betrayed. Unfortunately, we were born as Chinese, and even more unfortunately, we were born as anti-Japanese soldiers in name only. The words "deeply sinful" on the obituary are a portrayal of the dilemma faced by our soldiers today.</p>
<p>A sergeant major even said frankly, "Let's be honest, brothers. Given the current situation, if it weren't for the external enemy, there would be many mutinies." I could only offer a wry smile, as I had no words of comfort. At the same time, a question that had been hanging in my mind for a long time was finally resolved by their words. The rapid advance of the Japanese army has a reason.</p>
<p>An old village chief from Hanjiazhuang in ten townships of Lulong County said, "An army that can fight bravely will definitely not harass the people. Conversely, an army that harasses the people everywhere cannot fight. China has been in civil war for years, causing great suffering to the people. In addition, after the September 18th Incident, the residents in the war zone have supplied military needs, which has mostly exceeded their ability to bear. If they are harassed by illegal soldiers again, they can only resign themselves to being slaves of a conquered country, because the crime is nothing more than that."</p>
<p>Army Commander He understood the people's difficulties and sent out secret agents. Illegal soldiers were punished by military law if they were discovered or reported. The people were very grateful. In the villages I visited, most of the residents had fled, and well-off families had mostly fled to the mining areas. The rest either stayed behind or took temporary refuge in the mountains and cellars. Luan City was once completely empty, but after the county magistrate and army personnel went to persuade them, some gradually returned to cultivate the land. However, how long did it last before they suffered the tragedy of fleeing again?</p>
<p>Luan County has a vast area and a population of over 910,000. Last year, it collected enough 70,000 in land tax and grain. It has strived to develop education, but most of the schools in the city and near the river have been dissolved in name. The graduation exams were held in Tangshan. Superstition is still prevalent in the countryside, and it has not been broken. The "Zhang Tianshi enters Beijing, and half the people will die this year" warning is diligently copied and circulated, and it is everywhere. The morale of the people seems quite low, but the workers in the mining area and the nearby residents have a vigorous spirit. The county militia of about 3,000 men can still fulfill their responsibility to maintain law and order. The prisoners in custody had already been sent to Tianjin, but when Changli and other counties were about to fall, they sent another 130 people. When they were transferred to Tianjin, they were rejected. Keeping them meant no food for the prisoners, and releasing them meant no authority. Officials like to shirk their responsibilities to each other, which can be seen from this. What is suffering is only this group of prisoners.</p>
<p>Wherever the enemy army goes, if they ask for something from the people, they must first bow deeply. When drinking water, they must also feign to offer a 1-mao coin in order to deceive our villagers. The leaflets distributed by the planes have absurd words on one side and seductive erotic pictures on the other. The intention is insidious and the methods are despicable. (13th)</p>
<h3>The Sichuan War Situation Expands</h3>
<p>The 29th Army Also Joins the Battle, Disturbing the Entire Province. Fierce Fighting on Both Sides in the Jianyang Area Causes Many Casualties. Jiang Sends Telegram to Cease Fire to Avoid Creating Opportunities for the Communist Bandits</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: The Sichuan war has officially broken out again. The 24th and 28th armies are now in a period of fierce fighting. Deng Jinkang, the army commander of the 28th Army, left Chengdu on the 4th and went to Xindu, where he was stationed in Baoguang Temple, directing military operations in all directions. He planned to concentrate in three routes: one to Xindu and Hanzhou, one to Pixian and Guanxian, and one to Jianyang and Lezhi. He appointed three route commanders: Chen Shunu, the commander of the 3rd Division, as the commander of the first route; Huang Yimin, the commander of the 2nd Division, as the commander of the second route; and Yang Rongxiang, the commander of the Training Division, as the commander of the third route. Each was assigned a force of over 15,000 men, deployed in front of the battle line, to fight the 24th Army.</p>
<h3>Expanding the Front</h3>
<p>Liu Zigan of the 24th Army had made full preparations for the battle. He appointed Wang Yuanhu, the commander of the 5th Division, as the commander-in-chief of the first route, leading 20,000 troops to attack Wenjiang, Pixian, and Guanxian, which became the fuse. He used the 22,000 troops of Chen Hongwen's 6th Division to press on Jianyang, with Chen as the commander-in-chief of the second route. He used Zhang Zhihe's 1st Division, leading 30,000 troops, to advance from Chengdu to the Xinhu-Hanzhong area, with Zhang as the commander-in-chief of the third route.</p>
<p>After both sides deployed their forces, on the 5th, Wang Yuanhu's troops clashed with the Zhou Shaozhi Brigade of the 28th Army stationed in Shiyangchang, which belongs to Chongqing, followed by fierce fighting. The sound of gunfire for three hours shattered the calm Sichuan situation. This was the opening ceremony of the Sichuan war again. On the 6th, both sides mobilized their troops more urgently, preparing for a major battle. On the 7th, the major battle began. Wang Yuanhu used five regiments to engage the Zhou Shaozhi Brigade of the 28th Army stationed in Wenjiang, followed by hand-to-hand combat. Zhou was unable to withstand it and abandoned Wenjiang, and the 24th Army immediately moved into the area. Liu Zigan then used 50,000 troops to put general pressure on Xindu, Hanzhou, Pixian, and Guanxian, wanting to drive the 28th Army into the Songli Mao area and occupy their territory.</p>
<p>On the 8th, the Baoding-affiliated generals and officers in the 24th and 28th armies came forward again as Lu Zhonglian, making every effort to mediate in the hope of shortening the front and preventing the war from expanding. However, their efforts were unsuccessful.</p>
<h3>Disturbing the Entire Province</h3>
<p>On the 10th, the war clouds were dense and the atmosphere became tense again. On the night of the 11th, fierce fighting broke out in the Jianyang area. Chen Hongwen used ten regiments to attack the county seat. After Chen Shunu's troops, You Guangju, and Sun Xiansong's brigades calmly responded, Wang Xuejiang's brigade launched a surprise attack, defeating Chen Hongwen's troops. Both sides suffered more than a thousand casualties. On the 12th, Liu Zigan increased reinforcements by mobilizing the Shi Zhaowu and Mou Suifang brigades to besiege Jianyang and attack Lezhi directly.</p>
<p>On the 13th, another fierce battle broke out. Chen Shunu's troops were weak and in danger of collapse, but they had made contact with Li Qixiang of the New 6th Division stationed in Anyue Suining. If necessary, Li could participate in the war and confront the 24th Army. The troops of the 29th Army stationed in the Shehong area were also preparing to assist the 28th Army. The Red bandits who fled to Sichuan, in order to promote the outbreak of the Sichuan war, abandoned Tongjiang, Nanjiang, Bazhong, and other places, and made other plans to allow the Sichuan warlords to recklessly fight each other in order to reap the benefits of watching from the sidelines. Therefore, the 29th Army had the opportunity to participate in the civil war, acting in concert with Deng Jinkang to resist the invasion of the 24th Army.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the 13th, fierce fighting broke out in Xindu, Guanxian, and Pixian between the 24th and 28th armies. Deng Jinkang personally commanded the military operations in the army. Neither side prevailed.</p>
<h3>Declaring Their Position</h3>
<p>Deng then sent a telegram to the entire Sichuan province, declaring that the re-opening of the Sichuan war was purely due to the 24th Army provoking a dispute and bullying friendly troops. During this period of serious national crisis, they were committing such a rebellious act. He asked all parties to uphold justice and support each other with righteousness. Tian Songyao of the 29th Army also sent a telegram to all parties, saying that Liu took advantage of the fact that the Red bandits in northern Sichuan had not yet been suppressed and擅自啓 川戰 端, creating an opportunity for the Communist Party. Sending troops to press on Jinkang was no different from demonstrating to the 29th Army. In addition to participating with the entire army and making righteous efforts, he would also open up routes and lead them into the 24th Army's defense zone, disrupting their various activities to punish their nature of loving chaos.</p>
<p>Liu Zigan also sent a telegram to all parties, saying that since the previous war, the army's defense area had shrunk and the troops could not be maintained. Rather than sitting and waiting to die, it would be better to open up a way out, temporarily borrowing friendly troops' defense areas to temporarily solve the current difficulties and maintain the status quo.</p>
<p>Yang Sen of the 20th Army stationed in the north and Liu Cunhou of the 23rd Army stationed in Suiding issued a telegram expressing their attitude towards the dispute between Deng and Liu, requesting that military action be stopped immediately and that both sides守著陣線静候 中央 裁决, not to轻啓衅端, causing suffering to the people of Sichuan and disturbing the various armies.</p>
<p>However, Liu Xiang of the 21st Army stationed in southeastern Sichuan has an ambiguous and unclear attitude, expressing no support for any party. It is rumored that the reason why Liu Zigan dared to send troops to press on the 28th Army was that he had obtained Liu Xiang's consent in advance. Because Liu Zigan and Liu Xiang are uncle and nephew. In the previous war, Liu Xiang seized more than four counties from Liu Zigan's defense area, and they were all fertile land, making it difficult for the army to maintain itself. Therefore, Liu Xiang tacitly allowed him to develop in other directions without interfering, so there was no clear attitude. Now, even though the great war between the Liu and Deng armies has begun, there is no expression of any kind.</p>
<h3>Jiang's Telegram to Cease Fire</h3>
<p>Chairman Jiang of the Military Commission sent a telegram a few days ago to stop the Sichuan war. The original telegram said, "Limited to arrival immediately, Chongqing Supervisor Liu Fu Cheng brother, San-tai Supervisor Tian Song-yao brother, Chengdu General Commander Liu Zi Gan brother, Deng Army Commander Jin Kang brother, Suining Yang Army Commander Zi Hui brother, Sui-ding Liu Army Commander Ji Zhi brother and transfer to each division commander,The Sichuan Red bandit encirclement plan was negotiated by the headquarters sending liaison staff Yin Zuchun, Ye Wei, etc. to Sichuan, to consult with Brother Songyao and the representatives sent by Fu Cheng to jointly formulate it. It is still appropriate. Now I hear that Tian's troops have recovered Tongjiang, if each unit can advance at the same time and attack from different directions, then the Communist bandits will not be able to take care of both ends and will not have time to reorganize. It will not be difficult to sweep them away in one fell swoop. The key to the problem is that we must have the determination to have no bandits or me and strive for the real effect of working together. Material replenishment, mutual accommodation and whether there is or is not, still no self-dividing territories, or slightly hesitant, each unit based on the plan, rectify the troops, urgent advance and urgent attack, all the troops that have not participated in the encirclement of the red bandits, should be drawn urgently, mutual support, Wan should not take advantage of the opportunity to resist the virtual, invade the defense area, self-start internal struggle, so as to avoid creating opportunities for the communist bandits. The Xu Kuang remnant troops entered Sichuan at the beginning, not more than ten thousand people, without being severely suppressed at the beginning, so that they were fortified in Tongjiang, the bandit troops threatened the masses everywhere, the harm became more and more profound, relying on deep and thick, will inevitably spread, more difficult to clean up than the situation in Gan and E. The failure of Gan and E, there are many precedents, enough to be a lesson, I hope that you brothers will join forces and abandon resentment, stop internal struggle, and do not make a big mistake for luck. All the circumstances of the meeting and advance encirclement, I hope to report at any time. Zhong Zheng seal."</p>
<p>Since the Liu and Deng armies fought each other, all the celebrities and important figures from all walks of life in Sichuan, such as Yin Changheng, Xu Xiaogang, Zhou Dao, Xu Jiong, and Chen Guodong, also sent telegrams asking to stop the civil war and not to suffer the people of Sichuan again.

<h3>The Nineteenth Route Army's Anti-Japanese Vanguard's Itinerary</h3>
<p>(Will pass through Hunan Province and head directly to Wuhan, then north)</p>
<p>Guangzhou News: The two detachments of the Nineteenth Route Army's Anti-Japanese Vanguard that arrived in Guangdong, after reaching Yuantan and being inspected and addressed by Cai Tingkai, the first detachment continued its advance towards Shaoguan from Yuantan on the 8th of this month. Yang Hanzong's and Xie Dingxin's regiments of this detachment arrived in Lechang late on the night of the 11th. The two regimental commanders, Yang and Xie, and the political training personnel of the regiment, immediately convened local groups, detailing the significance of passing through the north, so people along the way welcomed them sincerely. As for the second detachment, Wu Luxun's and Yang Changhuang's regiments, they are expected to assemble in Lechang on the 12th, and together advance to Pingshi, passing through Hunan Province and heading directly to Wuhan. As for the first and second detachment commanders, Zhang Yan and Tan Qixiu, they are scheduled to depart from Guangzhou today (12th) with Shen Chongxi, the director of the campaign headquarters, and all the personnel of the headquarters, heading north. In addition, Chen Fuyuan, the director of the military supply department of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, has been approved by Commander-in-Chief Cai to come to Guangdong and accompany the Anti-Japanese Vanguard north to fight the enemy. This time, the Nineteenth Route Army's Anti-Japanese Vanguard, in addition to the four regiments of troops, also has a Youth Service Corps, all organized by patriotic volunteers who aspire to serve the country by joining the army. The corps commander is Jin Yiting, the deputy commander is Zheng Jiannan, and it has internal advisors, a propaganda section, a general affairs section, a medical aid section, an administrative unit, a photography unit, a drawing unit, a lecture unit, a secretariat, special agents, a resident Guangdong commissioner, and a resident Hong Kong commissioner, etc. The corps is now departing in two batches, the first batch has already arrived in Shaoguan Lechang with the army, and the second batch departs today with the campaign headquarters. Yesterday, a public telegram was issued, saying, "1. (Omitted honorary titles) The brutal Japanese are bullying us to this extreme, having occupied our eastern provinces and captured Rehe and Yu, encroaching upon our territory by the day, threatening the very existence of our nation. The loyal and brave Nineteenth Route Army, revered by all, has risen in righteous resistance, sending an advance force to aid Rehe. The youth of Guangdong, stirred by righteous indignation, have voluntarily organized a service corps. The first detachment is heading north, vowing to annihilate the enemy with their blood and heads. Their journey is underway, and they will not turn back. We hope that all our comrades will rise up together. May those of understanding throughout the country teach them and guide them, and we shall be fortunate. Jin Yiting, Commander of the Youth Military Service Corps, Deputy Commanders Zheng Jiannan and Chen Shangxiong, lead all corps members in bowing." After the Guangdong Youth Service Corps set off, more than forty patriotic youths from Shanghai joined the corps. After approval by Commander-in-Chief Cai Tingkai, the corps commander, Jin Yiting, considering that the army was already passing through Hunan Province to Wuhan, and to avoid circuitous routes, ordered the Shanghai service corps to go directly to Wuhan from Shanghai to await assembly. A telegram was sent to Shanghai on the 11th to inform the personnel. Chen Mingshu, after arriving in Guangdong for many days and meeting with various parties, took the Jinshan vessel to Hong Kong from Guangzhou at 8:00 AM on the 11th, accompanied by his wife Zhu Guangzhen and Ouyang Ju, etc. Many military and political figures came to see him off. According to Chen, the impression he gained from this return to Guangdong was very good. After arriving in Hong Kong, he will go to Fujian or inspect the military situation at the front lines in Beiping and Tianjin, but nothing has been decided yet. As for Cai Tingkai, the commander-in-chief of the Nineteenth Route Army, he still needs to stay in Guangdong for a few days to handle the affairs of the Anti-Japanese Vanguard heading north before returning to Fujian.

<h3>Fengxian</h3>
<p>Order to Implement Education for Prisoners</p>
<p>The county government received an order from the provincial government yesterday, instructing it to immediately set up education for prisoners, establish a repentance room, and recommend several repentance teachers to take turns visiting the prison to implement repentance education, hoping to achieve the effect of reforming prisoners and turning them to good. Currently, the county government has instructed the Education Bureau to instruct the two civil education centers of Nanqiao and Fengcheng to send personnel to the prisons on a monthly basis to implement repentance education.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Telegram Requesting Completion</p>
<p>of the Puhuitang Project</p>
<p>The Sijing Town Chamber of Commerce believes that the Puhuitang River has been dredged in various sections of Songjiang and Qingpu, but the section from Yaotianqiao Daigang west to Tushanwan has not yet started construction, which is of great importance to inland transportation. Yesterday, they specifically telegraphed Shanghai Mayor Wu to order the bureau to dredge it. The original telegram said, "To Mayor Wu Jun of Shanghai: We have found that the Puhuitang River is an important waterway for the towns of Xujiahui, Hongqiao, Qibao, Sijing, Qingpu, and Songjiang in Shanghai. Due to years of neglect, it has become silted up and shallow. The people along the river have repeatedly appealed, and finally the National Government's Songhu War Zone Relief Association allocated funds for dredging. Now, various sections have been gradually put into construction, and the Songqing River section has been completed. The local people are deeply gratified. However, the section from Tianyao Bridge Daigang west to Tushanwan has not yet started construction, which is incomprehensible. We have found that this section is the head of the entire river and is of great importance to the commercial transportation of the towns along the river. Moreover, we have found that the Relief Association's allocation of funds for this section is also included in the plan. Now that various sections are about to be completed, only this section has been delayed, which is deeply feared to affect inland transportation. Therefore, we telegraphically request that you order the Public Works Bureau to urgently excavate this section of the river, so that the entire river will be uniformly deep and facilitate inland commercial transportation."</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Cook Stabs Housewife to Death</p>
<p>Yang Shaoliang, who once served as the section chief of the Third Section of the Suzhou Police Affairs on the Jinghu Road, a native of Shou County, Anhui, rented a house at No. 15 Sibaidu Guan Lane near the Suzhou Station while in office and lived there with his family. After leaving office, he still lived in the original place. He had three wives and concubines. His second concubine, Ms. Yuan, 41 years old, a native of Changzhou, was suddenly stabbed to death in her room at 3:00 AM on the 16th. She was stabbed once in the chest with a small knife. It was heard that after Ms. Yuan was stabbed, she still got up to chase the murderer, but fell to the ground and died after walking a few steps. After the case occurred, Xu Dianchen, a native of Shou County who provided meals at his home, disappeared. He was subsequently captured by detective Yang Fushan at Huguan and sent to the Third Branch of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation on the morning of the same day.</p>
<h3>Taicang</h3>
<p>Director of National Goods Exhibition Under Surveillance</p>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Traveling Troupe, under the pretext of exhibiting national goods, mixed in and sold Japanese goods. This was discovered and reported by citizens Lu Zuheng and Zhang Menghua, and confirmed by the Hate Goods Inspection Association. It is now learned that the county party headquarters held a meeting the night before last and decided to notify the county government to temporarily place the person in charge under surveillance and telegraph the province to ask for instructions on how to deal with the matter. They also telegraphed the county government yesterday, requesting that the bailiffs temporarily place Wang Yanqing, the person in charge of the troupe, under surveillance pending resolution.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Gangsters Extort Watch Shop</p>
<p>Zhu Baochang Watch Shop on Shengxiang Bridge Street in the city, opened by Zhu Fengzao, a native of the county. The other day, Zhu's wife suddenly received a threatening letter from a gangster, signed "Anti-Japanese National Salvation Corps," demanding 1,000 yuan, and agreeing to meet at Seventy-Two Rocking Car Bay in Huishan on the twentieth day of the old calendar, and hand it over to someone wearing a duckbill hat and a short coat, otherwise, don't blame our country for its ruthless methods, etc. Zhu's wife was greatly frightened after receiving the letter, but decided to ignore it because business in the store was slow and there was no such large sum of money at the moment.</p>
<h3>Municipal Engineering Taken Over by the County</h3>
<p>The First District Office of this county, because municipal engineering belongs to the scope of the First District, specifically requested the county government to forward a request to the Construction Department, asking that the affairs of the municipal engineering office of this county be transferred to the District Office for handling. In addition, citizens Cao Quan and others also jointly submitted a request to the Construction Department, exhaustively stating the reasons for changing the system of the municipal engineering under the jurisdiction of the county government's technical office. After receiving the submission, the Construction Department believed that the municipal engineering office was responsible for undertakings that were mostly technical and sanitary in scope, and that specialized personnel were required for its design and construction. The temporary cancellation of the construction bureaus of various counties in this province was originally intended to concentrate the functions of the county government and improve administrative efficiency. If municipal engineering were handed over to the district office for handling, separating it from the jurisdiction of the county government, it would be inconsistent with the administrative system, and would cause disputes over authority and make it difficult for affairs to proceed. Yesterday, it instructed the county government of this county that the district office's request should not be discussed, and also instructed citizens Cao Quan and others to be informed.</p>
<h3>Shop Donations to Support Defense Expenses</h3>
<p>The Wuxi County Defense Corps' expenses were previously discussed and decided to raise funds from four items: gentry, wealthy businessmen, shops, ships and boats, and local special products. The collection standard for shop donations is to add one-tenth to the original house donation, which has already been sent by the county to the City Fund Production Committee, which forwarded it to the Chamber of Commerce to solicit opinions. The Chamber of Commerce, believing that the listed shops, ships, and special products were all related to commerce, immediately convened a meeting and all agreed that commerce was declining and the city's donations were extremely heavy, and it was impossible to bear the additional donations for the Defense Corps. They replied requesting consideration of the merchants' difficulties and exemption from the levy. The City Fund Production Committee also believed that house donations were related to police salaries and that the recent collection numbers were short, indicating that the people's strength was declining. If repeated levies were made, it was feared that it would have an impact and it was also replied to the county requesting exemption. However, the county government believed that this shop donation had already been included in the Defense Corps' budget and approved by the provincial government and could not be left unresolved. It has decided to implement the collection from July 1 and has sent a letter to the City Fund Production Committee to handle it as scheduled. The County Chamber of Commerce, believing that this matter involved increasing the burden on merchants, brought it up for discussion at yesterday's executive supervisory meeting and decided to convene a meeting of the property owners of each section on the 25th of this month to persuade them.</p>
<h3>Changshu</h3>
<p>Murder Case in Haicheng</p>
<p>Xu Xiang's son, named Rendao, who lived in Hupu in this county and was a native of another province, was quite fierce and made a living by selling smuggled salt. In the first month of this spring, Xu transported a load of smuggled salt from Nantong to Changshu for sale. The matter was known by the local ruffians Dabai Sannv and Lu Xiaoliu, who went to report it to the anti-smuggling team stationed in the town and seized all the smuggled salt sold by Xu. Xu Rendao fled upon hearing the news. Subsequently, Lu and Dabai each received more than ten yuan in rewards. Recently, Xu learned that the smuggled salt that was seized had been reported by Lu and others, and he held a grudge and planned revenge for a long time. On the night of the 13th of this month, Xu Rendao gathered six or seven accomplices, ripped open Dabai Sannv's chest and abdomen, dug out his internal organs, and threw his body into the river. Lu Xiaoliu was beaten and bruised and fled. The next morning, Lu Xiaoliu was discovered by someone lying on the beach. When touched, he woke up and described in detail what happened last night. Nearby, there were still bloodstains, which was the place where Bai Sannv died. Lu went to the hospital for treatment and asked to apprehend the murderer.</p>
<h3>Yang Weihang Kidnapped in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Yang Weihang, a wealthy merchant who lives on Xueqian Street in Changshu, is about 30 years old and owns assets of 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. He opened Jintai Money Shop and Qiantaiheng Silk and Satin Bureau and other shops in Changshu. At the end of last month, he went to Shanghai for business and stayed at the Huizhong Hotel on Sanma Road (Yang is also one of the shareholders of the hotel). Unexpectedly, not long after staying there, he was kidnapped. The news was silent. The hotel telegraphed his family because a guest had suddenly disappeared, but he had not returned home. Only one accountant was left in his family. After hearing the news, he knew there had been an accident. The other day, he received another letter saying that he had been kidnapped and was now in Taihu Lake, demanding 100,000 yuan for ransom, and asking him to go to Shanghai to negotiate. Now his accountant has arrived in Shanghai to find ways to negotiate a rescue.</p>
<h3>Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>Boundary Demarcation Between Nanjing City and Jiangning County</p>
<p>The demarcation of the boundary between Jiangning County, Jiangsu Province, and Nanjing City has been brewing for three years. The principles have been stipulated by the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Interior, but the demarcation line has not yet been realized, and disputes have arisen repeatedly. Now that Jiangning County is about to move its seat, the newly appointed County Chief of Autonomy Experiment Mei Siping believes that if the boundary between the province and the city is not clearly divided, it will be difficult in administration. He has now consulted with Nanjing Mayor Shi Ying several times. Regarding the boundary issue, the county and city will directly negotiate and submit it to the provincial government for approval in the near future.</p>

He was about 20 years old, wearing a gray cloth jacket, a blue-gray undershirt, a green woolen sweater, and black cloth pants, looking like a businessman. After being discovered by the town police there, the corpse was retrieved. A total of 170 yuan in banknotes, 1 yuan in silver dollars, 780 copper coins, and a receipt from a Shanghai dental company with the words "Ms. Guo" on it were found on his body. The corpse retrieval and burial association then reported the information to the Jiangdu Court Procuratorate, which sent personnel to inspect the corpse, take photos, and post notices to claim it.</p>

<p>Bloody Incident at Dasheng Factory During Labor Strike</p>
<p>At the Dasheng Yarn Factory in Tangzha, Nantong, over a thousand workers were laid off. On the 14th, the workers petitioned in the city to return to the factory. At 6:00 PM in the evening, they suddenly clashed with the provincial security regiment stationed at the factory. The workers wanted to rush into the Dasheng Factory, and the regiment soldiers fired warning shots, and stray bullets injured seven people. A female worker, Gu Wang, died immediately. On the 15th, party, government, military, and police held an emergency meeting in the county government. In addition to discussing and deciding on security measures for the problem of public security, representatives went to Tangzha that evening to properly negotiate with the factory about the aftermath.</p>

<h3>Rugao</h3>
<p>Woman Commits Suicide After Losing Love</p>
<p>In the Chemahu District of this county, there is Wu Ziyan, who runs a tobacco lamp shop. He married Zhou, who has been having an affair with a neighboring Wu for many years, as if they were husband and wife. Ziyan is weak and does not interfere. Even when Wu comes, the three of them eat and sleep together, and the scandalous reputation spreads. The other day, Zhou suddenly had a quarrel with her lover, and Wu left in a rage. Wu's wife regretted it, and sadness arose from it, and she had the idea of being tired of the world. She took advantage of the fact that people were not paying attention and secretly swallowed morphine to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was noticed by a customer, Zhu, who immediately gave her treatment, so there is no worry about her life.</p>
<h3>Elderly Woman of Seventy Met with Gruesome Assassination</h3>
<p>In the Fengjiadai area of Rugao's Lugang District, there was an old woman surnamed Wang, over seventy years old, who had a daughter married to Zhang Zijin of Yangzhuang. When Old Man Wang passed away, he adopted his nephew Wang Fuer as his heir. They had been living together for years in relative peace. On the 10th of this month, Fuer went to Yezhuyuan for business and did not return that day. Unexpectedly, that night his adoptive mother was assassinated and died. Her eyeballs and tongue were missing, and the state was very tragic. Wang Fuer, after weeping bitterly, first put her in a coffin and then tried to find out the truth, so as to prepare to appeal to the county for redress.</p>

Yesterday, the county government received another order from the provincial government to collect a land survey donation of 10 cents per mu and to affix a stamp on the printed series. It is heard that the county government will hold a meeting to discuss it.</p>
<h3>Xiaoshan</h3>
<p>Verdict in the Case of Killing a Paramour</p>
<p>The case of Xu Daoyang, a boatman from Daijiaqiao in Linpu, Xiaoshan, killing Wang Liansheng, his wife's lover, last month, was repeatedly investigated by the county court. Because the witnesses were not complete, the public trial had not yet been held.

<h3>Pinghu</h3>
<p>Japanese Spies Explore Coastal Defenses</p>
<p>The Zhapu Motor Station received a phone call from the Haiyan Station, saying that four Japanese people had been exploring the defenses along the coast in Yanjing. After being discovered, they fled east by car and asked to detain and check them. They immediately reported to the security team, who waited at the station. Not long after, they saw four people driving in a car. The team shouted to stop the car, but they ignored it. They raised their guns and aimed, and then started the car slowly. At this time, an adjutant came and waved them to drive east, so the Japanese and others did not stop and drove quickly to the east. Subsequently, Haiyan learned that the car had not been detained in Zhapu, and sent another telegram to the Jinliniangqiao Station to request detention. It is learned that the car has been detained at the Jin Station.</p>

<h3>Consular Body Discussed Factory Inspection Problem Yesterday</h3>
<p>Meeting Secret, It Is Rumored That A Proper Solution Has Been Reached</p>
<p>Municipal Government's Attitude Is Based On The Principle Of Not Impairing Sovereignty</p>
<p>Regarding the Special General Meeting of Western Taxpayers in the Public Concession, which attempted to seize our right to inspect factories by amending the bylaws of the Yangjingbang Regulations, which has been approved by the consular body of this port and submitted to the diplomatic corps for review, the consular body of this port convened a general meeting at the American Consulate on Jiangxi Road at 2:30 PM yesterday to discuss the matter. The following is a record of the meeting.</p>
<h3>Consuls in Attendance</h3>
<p>Those who attended the meeting yesterday included American Consul General and Leading Consul Cunninghame, Consular Body Secretary Lange, Japanese Consul General Ishii Shotaro, French Consul General Meyrier, and more than ten consuls and representatives of various countries stationed in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Meeting Secret</h3>
<p>The consuls and representatives of various countries stationed in Shanghai gathered at the American Consulate at 2:00 PM yesterday and met on the second floor of the consulate at 2:30 PM, dispersing at 3:15 PM. The content of the meeting was very secret and no press release was issued. The consuls who participated in the meeting did not easily reveal a word. Consular Body Leading Consul Cunninghame and Secretary Lange also did not say a word to the reporters who visited. However, according to reporters, after a meeting of three quarters of an hour, a concrete solution was reached.</p>
<h3>Proper Solution</h3>
<p>According to reliable sources, regarding the amendment to Article 34 of the bylaws of the Yangjingbang Regulations, after being approved by the consular body of this port, it was submitted to the diplomatic corps for review but was not approved. The consular body was instructed to discuss a proper solution that would take into account China's overall sovereignty on the one hand and the safety of factories in the concession on the other. The consular body convened a meeting yesterday to discuss this proper solution and has reached a decision. According to another source, the Municipal Council had previously drafted a compromise solution whereby the Municipal Council would establish a factory inspection office, and the inspectors would be Chinese hired by the Municipal Council who had received considerable factory inspection training, and a deadline would be set. This was discussed at the consular body meeting yesterday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Attitude</h3>
<p>The Municipal Government's attitude toward the inspection of factories in the concession has not changed. The sovereignty of our country's overall labor administration will not be allowed to be undermined by others. However, under the principle of not violating the central government's principles, the Municipal Government is very willing to discuss openly with the concession authorities in order to produce a proper solution. According to Secretary-General Yu, the central government has long decided on the principles of negotiation, but the Municipal Government has not had any contact with the concession authorities.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry News</h3>
<p>A Nanjing telegram on the 16th, Ministry of Industry news: Regarding the dispute over the right to inspect factories in the Shanghai concession, our side has put forward six principles. Secretary-General Yu Hongjun of the Shanghai Municipal Government and Fei Xindun, Director-General of the Municipal Council, had an informal talk last week, and the opinions were quite harmonious, but no concrete solution has been formally decided. Another informal talk is needed to exchange views. Afterwards, the two sides will discuss the cooperation methods and inspection procedures in writing. After the two sides have the same opinions, a formal meeting will be held. At that time, the Ministry of Industry will also send personnel to attend and decide on an appropriate solution.</p>
<h3>People from Tianjin and Beiping Flee South to Seek Refuge</h3>
<p>Passenger Volume on Northern Ocean Liners Increases Sharply</p>
<p>Hotel Business in Shanghai Flourishes</p>
<p>With the Japanese invaders approaching, Tianjin and Beiping are in danger. Wealthy people generally want to move to a better place. Therefore, recently, when liners from Tianjin arrive at the port, loading gentry from Beiping and Tianjin who come to Shanghai to seek refuge, they are filled to the brim. In the past few days, ships such as Jardine Matheson's Dingsheng, Taikoo's Niuzhuang, Tongzhou, Shuntian, and China Merchants' Yushun, when arriving in Shanghai from Tianjin, have had more than double the number of passengers compared to usual. There is almost no space on the ships. These people are all staying in hotels, so the business of major hotels is booming.</p>
<h3>Central Mint's Coin Production Increases Daily</h3>
<p>Reaches a New Record of 200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency visited the Central Mint yesterday morning and asked Li Section Chief of the secretariat about the coin production situation and the establishment of the review committee. He was informed as follows.</p>
<h3>New Coin Production Increases Sharply</h3>
<p>According to Li, the output of new coins in the factory has increased because the workers are all newly hired and everything must be trained from scratch. The statistics show that the output can increase by more than 10,000 yuan per day, and the progress in the past month has been particularly rapid. By last Saturday, the number of coins minted had reached 200,000 yuan per day, the highest record since the start of minting. In the future, the daily output can reach 310,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>Review Committee Established</h3>
<p>The fineness of silver coins is now washed and sorted by scientific methods, completely using machine power, which is already more accurate than washing and sorting by manual labor. However, for the sake of prudence, a new coin review committee has been specially formed to monitor it at any time. The list of these committee members has now been fully published. The internal regulations and organization are currently being actively prepared by the committee members. The date of establishment has not yet been determined. The newly appointed American chief technician, Grande, has now departed from the United States and will be able to take office in Shanghai at the end of this month, so the date of establishment will be determined after the chief technician arrives in Shanghai. As for the new model, it will also be brought from the United States by the chief technician.</p>
<h3>To Be Used as Central Reserve</h3>
<p>As for the total number of coins produced by the factory since the start of minting, the total number before and after has reached about 1.7 million yuan. It has been decided that these new coins will be used as the central bank's reserve. At the same time, because some people think that the model currently being minted is unsatisfactory, it will not be circulated on the market for the time being. Therefore, it must wait until the new model arrives before the new coins can be put into general use on the market when they are re-minted. The rumors that the review committee will review it and then circulate it on the market are speculation.</p>
<h3>Matters Concerning Tianjin and Hangzhou Branch Factories</h3>
<p>The head factory has no definite news about the restoration of the Tianjin and Hangzhou branch mints. However, it is found that the idea of restoring the branch factories was still at the beginning of the abolition of taels and the conversion to yuan. The intention at the time was to fear that the demand for silver coins would inevitably increase sharply after the implementation of the yuan, so it was feared that the output of the head factory would not be enough, or that the supply would not meet the demand. Therefore, it was proposed to restore the Tianjin and Hangzhou branch factories when the supply was insufficient. Now the output of coins from the head factory is increasing rapidly, so whether or not to restore them is still undecided.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese General Association Formulates Measures to Assist Returned Refugee Overseas Chinese from Mexico</h3>
<p>Re-telegraphing President Sun to Plead for Donations to Help with Emergency Relief and Sending a Letter to the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong Asking for Assistance</p>
<p>This time, with the persecution of Chinese in Mexico, the 40,000 overseas Chinese in Mexico have been greatly oppressed. The Global Overseas Chinese General Association in this port, in the spirit of mutual assistance, has launched a relief effort. Mayor Wu, as the local official and honorary chairman of the Overseas Chinese General Association, has vigorously promoted it and has sent letters to various agencies in the name of the mayor, urging them to provide relief. His enthusiasm is deeply appreciated. Now, in order to provide thorough relief, the Overseas Chinese General Association, in addition to giving each refugee who passes through Shanghai a relief payment of ten yuan, still feels it is not enough. It plans to raise funds in Hong Kong to accommodate the refugees and has sent a letter to the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong asking them to handle it nearby, and asking the Guangzhao Public Hall to allocate a large sum of money to help with the relief. It has also re-telegraphed President Sun to ask for relief.</p>
<h3>Cable to President Sun</h3>
<p>To Honorable President Sun of the Nanjing Legislative Yuan: Your cabled messages were received, but no reply has been forthcoming, which causes great concern. The distressed overseas Chinese await rescue and require funds for sustenance. We are compelled to cable again, earnestly requesting donations for immediate relief to alleviate the plight of the overseas Chinese. Can this be accommodated? We still hope for a reply. Respectfully, Huang Zhulin and others, Representatives of Distressed Overseas Chinese in Mexico. [Stamped: Xian]</p>
<h3>Allocation of Funds for Relief</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce specially dispatched its Secretary-General, Peng Canguang, together with representatives of the distressed overseas Chinese, Huang Zhulin and Lin Wenli, to the Guang Zhao Association to personally discuss the matter with its Chairman, Wen Zongyao. Mr. Wen personally received and accommodated their request. After consultation, it was unanimously agreed that the distressed overseas Chinese from Mexico, most of whom were from Guangdong, should be returned to Hong Kong and that efforts should be made to accommodate them and provide funds for their repatriation, in order to fulfill humanitarian obligations and assist fellow villagers. Mr. Wen expressed his extreme agreement and immediately promised that the Guang Zhao Association would, in conjunction with the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong, allocate substantial funds for relief. He also sent a separate letter requesting the hospital to handle the matter. It can be said that the Chinese General Chamber of Commerce's handling of the relief of distressed overseas Chinese has been thorough and comprehensive.</p>
<h3>Letter to Hong Kong for Assistance</h3>
<p>The original letter from the association to the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong (attached with a draft plan for relief) is excerpted below: "Regarding the matter that our 40,000 overseas Chinese compatriots in Mexico have suffered unwarranted oppression from the anti-Chinese party in Mexico. Their properties have been confiscated, they have been illegally detained, and even forcibly deported. As a result, they have fled back to the country in a state of disarray, alone and destitute, with no food or clothing, empty pockets, and no homes to return to. The cries of women and children are unbearable. Currently, more than 4,000 people have been forcibly repatriated, and another 20,000 are yet to come. If no measures are taken to support them, how can we face the distressed overseas Chinese and properly care for them? Our association, as a service organization for overseas Chinese, cannot stand idly by in the face of this situation. In addition to requesting the government to lodge a serious protest with Mexico and to quickly devise appropriate measures, the immediate need is to raise funds for relief. We have received donations of 1,000 yuan from Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and 1,000 yuan each from Shi Dezhi and Du Yuesheng, as well as the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company. Donations have also been received from the Sincere Company, China National Tobacco Corporation, Guangdong Bank, and others. However, this is merely a drop in the bucket and still insufficient. Moreover, as the distressed overseas Chinese are mostly from Guangdong, we are compelled to ask the Guang Zhao Association to allocate substantial funds so that they can be accommodated in Hong Kong and repatriated to Guangdong. The Guang Zhao Association, mindful of their fellow villagers, has readily agreed and intends to invite the Tung Wah Hospital to assist in the handling of the matter in order to achieve a concerted effort. We have long admired your hospital's dedication to charity and generosity in helping the needy. You will surely sympathize with this cause. In addition to coordinating with the Guang Zhao Association and sending separate letters to our association's representatives in Hong Kong, Chen Dasan and Lin Zishi, we dare to send this letter earnestly requesting your assistance in saving the distressed overseas Chinese and comforting our fellow villagers. The greatness of this meritorious act is no less than bringing the dead back to life. The details of the relief plan are provided in a separate document. We hope you will investigate and handle the matter and reply accordingly. Respectfully addressed to the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong. From the Presidium of the Global Chinese General Chamber of Commerce: Guo Shun, Wu Chengyu, Wang Zhengting, Zheng Hongnian, Jian Yingfu. May 26th."</p>
<h3>Relief Measures</h3>
<p>Draft Relief Measures for Distressed Overseas Chinese from Mexico: (1) When distressed overseas Chinese who have been deported from Mexico arrive in Shanghai, the Global Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will send personnel to receive them and provide each person with a small amount of pocket money for sustenance. (2) When the aforementioned distressed overseas Chinese arrive in Hong Kong, the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong will assign responsible personnel to receive them upon arrival, provide accommodation and food, and purchase boat tickets to assist them in returning to their hometowns. (3) All relief expenses required in Hong Kong will be jointly borne by the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong and the Guang Zhao Association in Shanghai, or efforts will be made to raise sufficient funds. (4) For each batch of distressed overseas Chinese returning to Hong Kong, the Global Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will provide a list of names and the ship's schedule and name to the Tung Wah Hospital in Hong Kong for verification and reception. (5) In order to prevent problems and facilitate relief, the Global Chinese General Chamber of Commerce will issue certificates of identification to the distressed overseas Chinese (one per person) for verification and to prevent abuse. The format will be determined separately. Respectfully submitted by the Global Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yesterday, Citizens' Associations of Two Special Districts Inspected Goods of Enemy Origin</h3>
<p>Secret Informant Box Established</p>
<p>Announcement Issued</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' United Association, in order to eliminate goods of enemy origin within the district, first inspected stores along Henan Road the day before yesterday. As the task was not completed, it continued yesterday. Shen Yuntao, Tong Shuangyang, Zhu Zhichun, Fang Peicheng, Ge Futian, Chen Shude, and others inspected more than 100 establishments, including the Civilization Printing House and the Commercial Press, and found no goods of enemy origin. In order to alert unscrupulous merchants, the association has established a secret informant box at its headquarters since yesterday, soliciting confidential reports. Yesterday, someone confidentially reported that a large quantity of goods of enemy origin had entered the cotton yarn and iron industries on Suzhou Road. The association plans to send personnel to investigate immediately, to ensure that goods of enemy origin are eliminated and unscrupulous merchants disappear.</p>
<p>The National Goods Promotion Committee of the Second Special District Citizens' United Association began inspecting goods of enemy origin yesterday. Recognizing that goods of enemy origin have recently flooded the market and have been disguised by unscrupulous merchants, not only are customers easily deceived, but the future of national goods is also significantly affected. The association issued a special announcement to all national goods merchants and factories, requesting them to report their products for verification and introduction. The original text is as follows: "For public notification: It has been found that goods of enemy origin have recently flooded the market, and counterfeit national goods are particularly prevalent, leading to confusion and making it impossible to distinguish between them. Not only are customers deceived, but national goods merchants and factories are also harmed. In view of this, this association has resolved to announce that national goods merchants and factories may have their products verified and introduced by this association. At the same time, we will investigate counterfeit products to eliminate confusion. Therefore, we hereby notify all manufacturers that if you have excellent products, please send samples to the association for examination so that we can verify and introduce them. If you discover counterfeit products, please report them to the association for handling. This announcement is made." The association also announced to employees and workers of various shops yesterday: "For public notification: It has been found that some patriotic groups have used explosives to warn unscrupulous merchants, which has harmed innocent employees and workers. Therefore, we hereby notify all manufacturers, workers, and shop employees that if you discover goods of enemy origin, please report them to this association to avoid being implicated."</p>
<h3>Citizens Propose Levying Rent</h3>
<p>To Supplement Aviation Donations</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, since the fundraising for the National Aviation Salvation Fund began in this city, citizens such as Huang Ciwei, with patriotic enthusiasm, have petitioned the municipal government to levy one or two months' rent to supplement the aviation donations. Others have proposed printing aviation donation receipts to replace rent receipts, registering them with the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and having the municipal government directly collect the rent from tenants, who can then use the receipts to pay their landlords. The proposers believe that during last year's "January 28th" Incident, Shanghai merchants and citizens went on strike to resist the enemy, but the rent during the strike period was not reduced at all. Furthermore, during this fundraising for the Aviation Salvation Fund, property owners often sleep during the day and go out at night, making it difficult for the fundraising teams to find them. If their rent is levied to support aviation, it would not only be a fair measure but also greatly please the public. It is reported that many people support this proposal, and the municipal government is currently evaluating and processing it.</p>
<h3>British Assessor Mr. Grahame Retires and Returns Home</h3>
<p>Many People Saw Him Off Yesterday</p>
<p>Mr. Grahame, the British Assessor in China, retired due to old age and set off to return home yesterday on the British India Steam Navigation Company's ship "Carthage." Mr. Grahame, who is 69 years old, came to China in 1921 as Deputy Assessor and was promoted to Assessor in 1927. He has been in Shanghai for 12 years and is known for his integrity and his enthusiasm for social welfare. Therefore, many people saw him off yesterday, and everyone was reluctant to part with him.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Clarifies That the Police Department Does Not Use Torture</h3>
<p>On the 2nd of this month, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, based on a report from the Shanghai United Association of Patriotic Organizations, stated that Luo Sizhang and Lu Yong were subjected to cruel treatment when they were captured by the Public Concession police in December of last year. They sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting clarification. The Deputy Secretary-General of the Municipal Council has now replied to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, stating that your association also believes that this is unlikely to be true. The truth is that Luo Sizhang and Lu Yong were captured on December 22nd of last year in Room 41 of the Unity Hotel at 344 North Hai Road. The workers were members of the so-called Blood Soul Assassination Group, and they were accused of being affiliated with bandits and illegally possessing explosives. They were subsequently sentenced to three months imprisonment each by the court. As for the allegation that the police used torture, it has been found to be completely untrue. Neither of the defendants complained of mistreatment, either at the police station or in court. During the first interrogation, Luo Sizhang requested medical treatment, which was immediately granted after examination. It was found that he had a carbuncle that had just been surgically removed, and the bandage was still in place.</p>

<h3>U.S. Marine Corps Commander Colonel Gilder Died of Illness Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>According to the Greater America Evening Post, Colonel Gilder, Commander of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, died of illness at Hong'en Hospital at 0:50 AM this morning (the 16th), at the age of only 51. Colonel Gilder was the most popular officer in the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai and was loved by both his superiors and subordinates. He was assigned to Shanghai after the previous Commander, Colonel Holcomb, was discharged due to heart disease and took office in March. However, a week ago, he was hospitalized due to overwork and nervous exhaustion. It was expected that he would recover after a few weeks of rest, but unexpectedly, he suddenly suffered from hemorrhage last night and died despite all efforts. The sad news has shocked the country. The flag was lowered to half-mast this morning, and the soldiers wore mourning bands to express their grief. His wife in Shanghai is in great sorrow and has fainted. His mother is still in New York and is expected to be deeply grieved upon hearing the news. Colonel Gilder's remains have been moved to the American Funeral Parlor. The date of the funeral has not yet been determined. It is reported that Colonel Gilder is the fourth commander of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps to die suddenly. Since Colonel Hill led the entire regiment to Shanghai in 1927, he committed suicide with a gun the following year. His successor, Colonel Davis, died of a sudden heart attack a few weeks after leaving office. His successor, Colonel Lemmon, is still alive. In recent years, only one commander of the regiment has remained alive after completing his term of service in Shanghai. Moreover, Colonel Holcomb died suddenly of heart disease on Christmas Eve last year, and Colonel Gilder died of cerebral hemorrhage just two months after taking office. The vacant position will be temporarily filled by Lieutenant Colonel Morse, who previously served as acting commander.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Sends Condolences for the Death of the U.S. Military Commander</h3>
<p>Colonel Gilder, Commander of the 4th Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, passed away yesterday morning. Mr. Bell, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, immediately sent a letter to Mr. Morse, Deputy Commander of the regiment, expressing his deep regret. He stated that it was regrettable that Colonel Gilder had died shortly after returning to Shanghai and taking office, following the death of his predecessor, Colonel Holcomb. He expressed his condolences to the 4th Regiment and Colonel Gilder's family.</p>

<h3>Shao Lizi Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>

The date of his departure for Shaanxi has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Mail to Luandong Delivered as Usual</h3>
<p>Postal Rates to Nanyang Are Adjusted According to Gold Prices, Not Increased</p>
<p>Regarding postal matters, a reporter from the Central News Agency learned the following from responsible officials of the Directorate General of Posts: (1) Revised postal rates for letters sent from private postal agencies to Nanyang. The postal rates for international mail have always been calculated based on the gold franc exchange rate. Since the price of gold has risen, the postal rates for letters sent from our country to foreign countries have gradually increased from 10 cents to 25 cents. The same applies to letters sent to Nanyang. However, in order to show consideration for overseas Chinese, the postal rate for letters sent from private postal agencies to Nanyang is still only 5 cents (half of the previous international postal rate) and has not been uniformly changed. Recently, due to the extremely difficult financial situation of the postal service, the postal administration has incurred excessive losses in paying the shipping costs for these items in gold francs. It was forced to revise the rates according to the gold franc exchange rate, but still maintain the principle of half-price, charging only 12.5 cents in national currency to show preferential treatment. As for letters from private postal agencies sent from Nanyang, the local postal administration has already increased the rate from one-half to two-thirds of the international postal rate, which is higher than the postage collected in our country. This adjustment is actually based on gold prices and is not an increase in charges. This postage increase was originally scheduled to take effect on May 1st, but it was temporarily postponed because the overseas Chinese were not fully aware of the situation. The Ministry of Communications is now consulting with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to provide a proper explanation, and it should be implemented soon. (2) Mail to and from all bureaus in Luandong is being handled as usual. Although the military situation in North China is very tense, all post offices in Luandong are still operating as usual, and mail to and from the area can be sent through. The report that mail to Qinhuangdao and Changli has been suspended is not true. The postal administration has not issued such a notice.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau to Establish Research Committee</h3>
<p>To Guide the Overseas Development of National Products</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, an official in charge of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry stated to reporters yesterday that the dumping of foreign goods has greatly affected national industries. Therefore, the Trade Bureau is paying attention to the dumping of foreign goods and reporting them to the Ministry of Industry at any time in order to find countermeasures. It is also studying the current situation of national goods trade and guiding its improvement. His remarks are summarized below:</p>
<h3>Responding to Dumping</h3>
<p>According to the statement, foreign goods have recently adopted a policy of planned price reductions and dumping against our country. For example, according to a letter from a friend, a certain foreign industrial and commercial consortium, united under the leadership of its government, is engaged in malicious commercial competition against our country. Its purpose is to bankrupt our country's industry and commerce in order to achieve its ambition of economic aggression. The government, in view of this, has established a dumping tax committee to collect dumping taxes and protect national infant industries. The Ministry of Industry, whose responsibility it is to guide and protect national industries, is considering countermeasures to remedy the situation. Therefore, the Trade Bureau is paying close attention to this and will report its findings to the Ministry of Industry for study at any time.</p>
<h3>Guidance to Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>For the above reasons, the Trade Bureau will strengthen its ties with national goods factories and various national goods movements in the future in order to gain a thorough understanding of the current state of national industry and provide guidance. At 1 PM this afternoon, the National Goods Movement Committee of the First Special District Citizens' United Association will hold the Second National Goods Movement Promotion Meeting at the Ningbo Native Place Association. The Trade Bureau has assigned Li Zejin and Chen Jingsheng of the Guidance Section to attend and participate. In the future, if there are similar gatherings, the Bureau will also send personnel to attend and provide guidance.</p>
<h3>Sino-Russian Trade</h3>
<p>After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, all trade relations will be gradually restored. The Ministry of Industry believes that Russian trade is mainly conducted by the government. Therefore, it has decided to establish a Trade Bureau to handle trade with Russia in order to coordinate everything. The regulations for the bureau's organization are currently being drafted by the Ministry. However, whether it will be subordinate to the International Trade Bureau or directly subordinate to the Ministry of Industry is still under consideration and will be decided after Director He recovers from his illness and is discharged from the hospital, and after consultation with Minister Chen Gongbo.</p>
<h3>Trade Research</h3>
<p>The Trade Bureau will establish an International Trade Research Committee to study the trade policies and current situation of various countries in order to discuss the attitude that our country should take towards international trade and to guide and assist the overseas development of national industries. The regulations for the committee's organization are still under review. Preparations will begin as soon as they are approved by the Ministry. As for the members of the committee, domestic economic experts and industry giants will be appointed.</p>

<h3>Yu Youren Cables Funds for Relief in Shaanxi</h3>
<p>Ministry of Railways Allocates Emergency Relief Funds to Shaanxi</p>
<p>Totaling 62,500 Yuan</p>
<p>Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan, has been receiving telegrams from the Shaanxi Provincial Government for several days, which state that since May 1st, the weather in the Weibei area of Shaanxi Province has suddenly changed. On the 2nd and 3rd, strong winds arose, destroying roofs and uprooting trees and crops. This was followed by heavy frost and heavy snow, causing great damage. Furthermore, there has been no rain after the frost and snow. If rain does not continue to fall, there is no hope of recovery, and the livelihood of dozens of counties will be cut off. Upon receiving the telegrams, Yu Youren believed that the disaster in Shaanxi was extremely serious. In addition to remitting 62,500 yuan of emergency relief funds allocated by the Ministry of Railways to the Shaanxi Relief Committee for relief yesterday, he is now trying to appeal to all parties for assistance. The two telegrams sent by Yu Youren remitting the funds are copied below.</p>

<h3>Feng Yong Returns to Shanghai from Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Feng Yong, President of Feng Yong University, recently returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou after visiting the Feng University students who are currently studying at the Aviation School. His attitude seemed rather negative. A reporter from the Central News Agency met Mr. Feng on the way yesterday and asked about his future plans. Mr. Feng replied that his future plans have not yet been determined. He may go north to participate in the war or go to Hangzhou for recuperation. A decision will be made in a few days. The reporter then asked Mr. Feng about the recent situation in North China and Feng University. According to him, North China is currently in a precarious situation. As for the Feng University students, except for a small number of volunteers who are still fighting on the front lines, the rest remain in Beiping. The current site of Feng University is the former site of the Army University. After the fall of Shenyang, Feng University moved into the interior, and President Chiang Kai-shek allocated the former site of the Army University to be used as the Feng University campus. Feng University has nothing except the campus and its teachers and students. If war breaks out in the old capital, Feng University is determined to coexist with the old capital.</p>

<p>Returned to Shanghai at 2 p.m. with Excellent Results</p>
<p>The Navy Department's two shallow-water gunboats, the Fuling and the Suining, were built by the Jiangnan Shipyard. The Suining warship has already completed its sea trials.

<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) to Take Over the Yangzi Wharf Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Extensive Repairs Will Be Carried Out After the Takeover</p>
<p>And the Head of the Chinese Warehouse is Designated to Manage It Concurrently</p>
<p>The Yangzi Wharf in Pudong, after the Ministry of Communications negotiated with the Japanese-owned Haiyang Society to recover it, the CMSNC petitioned to be assigned to manage it. The Ministry approved the petition and scheduled the takeover for tomorrow, incorporating it into the Chinese Warehouse. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Ministry Order Assigns it to CMSNC</h3>
<p>The Yangzi Wharf occupies 43 mu of land, with a wharf length of 550 feet and eight warehouses. After the Ministry of Communications negotiated with the Japanese-owned Haiyang Society for its recovery, the Navigation Administration Bureau temporarily took custody of it. Since the CMSNC was nationalized and after the Board of Directors petitioned the Ministry of Communications to assign the wharf to the company's management, the Ministry sent Gao Tingzi, the Director of the Navigation Administration Department, to Shanghai to negotiate. The day before yesterday, the CMSNC received a Ministry order approving the assignment. At the same time, the Navigation Administration Bureau also received a Ministry order to hand it over.</p>
<h3>Handover and Receiving Personnel</h3>
<p>Liu Hongsheng, the General Manager of the CMSNC, appointed Jin Duo, the Head of the Warehouse Affairs Section, and Jin Xin'san, the Head of the Chinese Warehouse, as receiving officers. After the takeover, it will be incorporated into the Chinese Warehouse and managed concurrently by Jin Xin'san, the Head of the Chinese Warehouse. At the same time, Zhu Yaoting, the Director of the Navigation Administration Bureau, appointed Chen Yici, the Head of the First Section, and Qin Jiyun, the Director of the Custody Office, as handover officers. They immediately rushed to prepare an inventory to facilitate the handover.</p>
<h3>Decision to Take Over Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Jin Duo and Jin Xin'san, the receiving officers from the CMSNC, contacted Chen Yici and Qin Jiyun, the handover officers from the Navigation Administration Bureau, the day before yesterday afternoon at 2 p.m. to discuss the handover procedures. It was decided that after the Navigation Administration Bureau completed the inventory, they would notify the CMSNC by telephone to determine the handover date. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Qin Jiyun last night, who stated that after receiving the order, they immediately rushed to prepare the inventory, which would be completed by the 17th, and the handover was scheduled for the 18th. A formal notification will be sent to the CMSNC tomorrow (i.e., today). The warehouse keeper who manages the warehouses will also be handed over.</p>
<h3>Plans to Hire Workers for Repairs</h3>
<p>The CMSNC considers the Yangzi Wharf to be dilapidated and in need of repair due to years of neglect. It has decided to hire workers for repairs immediately after the takeover and to demolish the wall separating it from the Chinese Warehouse to facilitate integration.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders a Large Batch of Telegraph Machines from England</h3>
<p>Worth 12,000 Pounds</p>
<p>Expected to Arrive in Two Months</p>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the telegraph machines used by various telegraph offices in China are mostly of the Morse and Weston types. Although these machines have high transmission speeds, re-punching telegrams on paper is slow. Recently, most countries have adopted the British Creed high-speed telegraph machine, which eliminates the re-punching step during transmission. Recognizing this, the Ministry of Communications has ordered seven machines from England, worth 12,000 gold pounds. They are expected to arrive in about two months and will be deployed to telegraph offices in Nanjing, Shanghai, Hankou, Tianjin, Beiping, Qingdao, and Yantai.</p>
<h3>U.S. Troops Stationed in Shanghai Will Visit the Cemetery in Songjiang</h3>
<p>The First Regiment of the U.S. Marine Corps stationed in Shanghai, according to custom, visits the grave of General Ward in Songjiang every year. This year, it is scheduled for 9 a.m. on the 28th of this month, taking the Shanghai-Hangzhou train to Songjiang and returning to Shanghai at 3 p.m. The U.S. Consul General, Mr. Cunningham, has notified the Municipal Government, requesting assistance in providing care. The Municipal Government has informed the Songjiang County Government.</p>
<h3>Labour Contracting System of 20/80 Issue</h3>
<p>Party and Government Authorities Summoned Labour Representatives for Questioning Yesterday</p>
<p>Will be Resolved in Accordance with the Central Government's Designated Methods</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dock Workers' Union has requested the implementation of the labour contracting system of 20/80 and has petitioned the Party and government authorities separately. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government received instructions from the Central Government to implement the dock labour contracting system of 20/80. The Municipal Government summoned representatives from the contractor side for questioning the day before yesterday. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., it summoned representatives from the worker side for questioning in the Municipal Government conference room. Thirteen worker representatives were present. Chen Kecheng and others from the Party and government authorities conducted the questioning and expressed that for the sake of maintaining the workers' livelihood, the matter would be resolved quickly in accordance with the Central Government's designated methods, so as to avoid further disputes between the two parties.</p>
<h3>Progress of the Fisheries Improvement Association</h3>
<p>Established Ten District Offices to Collect Taxes and Now Sends Warships to Cruise in the Open Sea</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe District Fisheries Construction Fee Collection Office of the Fisheries Improvement Committee has been actively carrying out fisheries construction and improvement plans since its establishment. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency interviewed Dai Yongtang, the Director of the office, yesterday and inquired about everything. He was kind enough to provide detailed information, which is recorded below:</p>
<h3>Establishment of District Offices</h3>
<p>The office manages the Jiangzhe region. Due to the vast area under its jurisdiction, management is difficult to cover. Therefore, it is divided into ten districts to handle affairs. Each district has a director who oversees the collection of construction fees and other matters within the district. (1) Ding Shen District, Director Wang Zhiliang; (2) Ning Zhen District, Director Cai Sheng; (3) Ning Xiangnan District, Director Wu Yichen; (4) Wen Tai District, concurrently managed by the third district; (5) Songhu District, concurrently managed by the head office; (6) Hang Jia Shao District, Director Wu Weinan; (7) Hu Tai Su District, Director Liu Tongyu; (8) Chongtong District, Director Gu Jiacai; (9) Haizhou District, concurrently managed by the eighth district; (10) Jing Chang District, Director Shen Zefei. The ten district directors have been appointed and have taken up their posts in their respective districts.</p>
<h3>Collection in Various Districts</h3>
<p>The office collects taxes on five types of fish: (1) fresh fish; (2) salted fish; (3) dried fish; (4) marinated fish; (5) shellfish. The collection standard is one percent. According to reports from the Directors of Ding Shen District, Chongtong District, Hu Tai Su District, Haizhou District, Hang Jia Shao District, and Wen Tai District, collection has begun and is proceeding smoothly. Ning Zhen District has not yet started collecting. No reports have been received from the other districts, and orders have been sent to urge them separately. Currently, the ice-fresh industries have unanimously approved the construction fee. Only the Shipu barrel fish merchants are still objecting, but this is a minor issue and has no bearing on the future of the office.</p>
<h3>Sending Warships to Cruise</h3>
<p>For the sake of maintaining the safety of fishermen and merchants, the office has consulted with the Fisheries Administration Bureau and sent warships to patrol the open sea. The Hai Lan warship has been dispatched to the Ning Zhen area, the Hai Hong warship to the Chongming Qidong Haizhou area, the Fu Hai warship to the Ding Shen area, the Qing An warship also departed yesterday evening to the Ning Zhen area, and the Hai Gu warship has been dispatched to cruise the Shengshan Daishan Ma Ji area.</p>
<h3>Improvement Plans</h3>
<p>Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry, and Chen Zhongsheng, the Director of the Fisheries Administration Bureau, have drafted improvement plans. The contents are: (1) to organize a fisheries bank; (2) to organize fishermen's lending offices. When fishermen's fishing businesses are limited by financial difficulties and cannot develop, measures will be taken to support them, and loans will be provided by the bank and lending offices according to the circumstances; (3) to establish coastal meteorological stations to report marine weather. In the event of hurricanes or other changes involving danger, preventive measures can be taken in advance; (4) to establish radio stations to report fisheries market conditions and other information.</p>

<h3>Dispute over the Statue of a Child Goddess Fraud Case</h3>
<p>Authenticated by Archaeologists as a Rare Treasure, Stored by Zhang Youquan Awaiting a Good Price</p>
<p>丨An Wenpu Fraudulently Sold the Statue and Falsely Accused the Owner of Kidnapping丨</p>
<p>丨An was Recently Arrested for Another Case, and the Owner Has Also Filed a Lawsuit丨</p>
<p>An Wenpu from Beiping suddenly went to Hong Kong from Shanghai in March of this year, posing as a major antique merchant. He defrauded two antique shops, Baoyuanzhai and Jiefa Zhan, in Hong Kong of an ivory vase and two ancient paintings. He took them back to Shanghai and sold them to antique shops such as Yibaozhai on Tongfu Road. Later, after the Hong Kong authorities received a report from the victims, they telegraphed the Shanghai Public Concession police authorities to investigate and arrest the major fraudster. Before he could be extradited to Hong Kong, he committed another crime in the French Concession. The Second Special District Court took him from the First Special District Court for interrogation and confirmed the facts. He has now been sentenced to imprisonment and confined in prison. However, it was recently discovered that An Wenpu had also defrauded Zhang Youquan from Sichuan of a</p>
<h3>Tang Dynasty Statue of a Child Goddess</h3>
<p>This item is a rare treasure. The details of his fraudulent activities are as follows: Yang Hui of the Tang Dynasty was a famous sculptor. His clay statues are now rare. Zhang Youquan from Sichuan possessed a statue of a child goddess that had been authenticated by archaeologists as indeed being the work of Yang Hui. Because Yang's sculptures have become highly valued in recent years, Zhang brought the statue to Shanghai this spring to sell it. At that time, Wenpu was also in Shanghai. Through an introduction, they became acquainted. Wenpu claimed to have a "Binpu Antique Foreign Goods Company" in Beiping. Zhang felt that he had a good understanding of antiques, so he gave him the statue to examine. Wenpu praised it repeatedly and took it upon himself to sell it. Zhang then entrusted the statue to him to sell on consignment. After ten days, Wenpu said that</p>
<h3>A Westerner Wished to Buy it</h3>
<p>He invited Zhang to negotiate the price with the Westerner. Unexpectedly, the Westerner only offered 2,000 yuan. Zhang did not want to sell it cheaply and took the statue back. Soon after, he received a telegram and hurried back to Sichuan. He entrusted the statue to his daughter, Zhang Yunhe, and son-in-law, Wu Xi'an, instructing them that if they received a reasonable price, they could sell it. Not long after Zhang returned to Sichuan, An Wenpu again asked Wu for the statue, saying that a customer wanted to buy it. Since Wu knew An well, he gave him the statue, agreeing to decide in three days. When the time came, An neither responded nor returned the statue. Wu urged him to return it, but he made excuses and delayed. From then on, the statue was in An's possession. After more than a month, An disappeared from Shanghai, having someone spread the word that he had taken a</p>
<h3>Westerner to Japan with the Statue</h3>
<p>To Tokyo, awaiting a good price before reporting back. Wu was helpless. It was not until August 24th of last year that he learned that An had returned to Shanghai and was staying at Room 415 of the Great China Hotel in the racecourse. Wu, his wife, and a friend immediately went to see him and inquired about the whereabouts of the statue. An was evasive. When Wu's tone became stern, fearing that his scheme would be exposed, he wrote a note, with his friend Jin Shaolu as guarantor, promising to sell it within three months or return the original item, otherwise he would pay 10,000 yuan. After signing the note, An changed rooms every day. Every time he met with Wu, he did not give his real address, and his whereabouts were extremely secretive. Around mid-October, as the agreed deadline approached, Wu suddenly heard people say that An had long ago</p>
<h3>Sold it for a Good Price and Spent the Money</h3>
<p>The note was just a way to delay, and he would make a fake statue to return within the deadline. Wu was shocked and asked his cousin, Xu Bokui, to help him watch An's movements. On the morning of November 22nd, Wu received a call from Xu, informing him that An had gone to Xu's house. Wu rushed to 6 Guanhua Lane, Lafayette Road, to meet with Xu and An. Xu said that An had decided to bring other antiques of equal value to the statue as collateral. But Wu waited until sunset, and An's brother, An Wenbin, still came empty-handed. When asked about the antiques to be used as collateral, he said they would be delivered at 9 p.m. After saying this, he left. Until midnight, Wenbin suddenly led the French Concession</p>
<h3>A Large Number of Armed Detectives</h3>
<p>They swarmed into the house, accusing Xu of being a kidnapper. Wu explained the situation. An Wenpu then accused Wu of being a ticket-watcher. Xu, Wu, and their friends were all arrested. After several trials by the Second Special District Court and the High Third Branch Court, the truth was revealed, and Xu and others were found innocent. However, the lawsuit ended, and An Wenpu's whereabouts were unknown. The statue was still difficult to recover. This spring, An's fraud case in Hong Kong was exposed. Wu only then learned of his whereabouts and was about to report him to the police. He happened to have secretly returned to Shanghai, throwing himself into the net. He was detained by the French Concession police for another case and sent to the Second Special Court for punishment. Wu Xi'an has now hired lawyer Shen Yuesheng to file a suit in the First Special Court, claiming 10,000 yuan for the statue. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Shen Hong presided over the trial. Because the defendant was imprisoned in the French Concession prison and had yet to be transferred, Judge Shen ordered a postponement for another hearing.</p>
<h3>Massive Export of Plough Cattle to Aid the Enemy</h3>
<p>Recently, many ships carrying plough cattle for sale in Shanghai have been entering Wusong. There are one or two or three or four ships every day. Yesterday, there were even more, with a total of five ships in one day, each carrying twenty or thirty or forty or fifty cattle. The cattle are transported from various ports in Jiangbei. The ships are mostly Jiangbei sandboats disguised as carrying fresh pigs to avoid attracting attention. It is said that these plough cattle are all sold in Shanghai to a certain country as food needed for military rations, so the profit is very high. However, the sale of plough cattle is prohibited by law, so in the past, most cattle dealers smuggled them at night. It is said that now, because a certain official with real power over the water transport is handling the transport, shipowners are acting openly and brazenly. According to Jiangbei people, these people only care about huge profits and disregard the great impact on farmers' cultivation in the future, which is very hateful.</p>
<h3>A Badger Eating People in Luodian</h3>
<p>A Girl Had Her Foot Bitten Off</p>
<p>Water and Fire Were Used to Capture One</p>
<p>Shenjia Archway, about three miles southwest of Luodian Town in Baoshan County, is behind Shenjia Cemetery. The day before yesterday evening, an eight-year-old girl named Shen from a local farmer was playing in the fields when she was dragged by a badger from the cemetery to the entrance of a grave, where it bit off her foot. It is said that because the entrance of the hole was narrow, it could not be dragged in, otherwise her life would have been in danger. Currently, the girl has been sent to the hospital for treatment. The villagers burned the badger in the cemetery with torches and poured water into the hole, capturing one weighing more than 170 kilograms.</p>
<h3>Phone Price Hikes in the Chinese District Seem Inevitable</h3>
<p>In response to the case, a letter was received from 46 trade associations, including the restaurant and food industry, jointly requesting that telephone fees not be increased until the industry and commerce in the Chinese area have recovered. This is a request that is truly unavoidable. The circumstances are being reiterated, and it is hoped that they will be considered and approved. It is noted that the Shanghai Silk Cotton Weaving Trade Association and others have submitted a report that includes a directive from the Ministry of Communications, which states that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau is adapting to local needs and increasing the efficiency of calls by refitting automatic telephone exchanges. The cost of the necessary machinery and materials is estimated at 3 million yuan. The cost of the machinery and materials will be paid in installments. In addition to the portion paid by the Ministry at the time of ordering, according to the machine purchase contract, the bureau will have to pay 4,000 to 8,000 U.S. dollars per month from the date of completion of the main exchange. There are more than 2,200 telephone subscribers in the north and south of Shanghai. The original rental income is only enough for routine maintenance. As for paying for the machinery and materials, there is no way to do so. The Ministry is unable to provide funds at this time of financial difficulty, and the merchants in the area have not yet recovered from the January 28th Incident, so some consideration must be given. Therefore, as a last resort, the rental fees for each household will be slightly increased to make up for it. This will not be enough to pay for the machinery and materials, and other methods must be devised. The facts are there, and they should be known to the merchants in Shanghai. In addition, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's refitting of automatic telephone exchanges has the same call efficiency as telephones in the concessions, but the rental fees charged are lower than those in the concessions. This shows that the Ministry has been considerate of the merchants' difficulties to the utmost. As for the statement that the number of employees will be reduced and consumption will be saved after the automatic exchanges are refitted, the bureau is now adding a manual switchboard to the bureau to facilitate communication between users in the Chinese and concession areas, dispatching personnel and dividing shifts for duty, specializing in connection. There is little reduction in the number of employees, and the increase in debt has exceeded the original routine budget by more than two times. The trade associations are all composed of merchants, and they must have a thorough understanding of business principles. They must carefully consider this, pay according to regulations, and the request to stop the Shanghai Telephone Bureau from raising prices should not be considered. A Ministry order has been issued for investigation and record. After verification, the Ministry's approval is very detailed, and the request from the restaurant and food industry trade associations for a temporary exemption cannot be granted. The corresponding letter is being sent in response. Please investigate and inform the trade associations to carefully consider the instructions and pay according to regulations. This is truly a matter of public interest. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<h3>Steamboat Workers Union Telegraphs to Investigate and Punish Road Workers Who Caused the Accident</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Workers Union sent a telegram to the Construction Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, saying: "Director of the Construction Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government in Zhenjiang, according to a letter from member Xin Da Wheel, veteran Lian Guo Yu, veteran Lian Bing Gen, on the 10th of this month at 1:00 p.m., en route from Suzhou to Shengze via Bei Di Nan Shou, a barge of workers from the Su Jia Road, forcibly wanted to be towed to Pingwang. The veterans and others politely refused because the boat was rotten and feared it could not be towed. The workers were unreasonable and aggressive. At the time, they were forced to comply. When passing Shuang Tingzi, as expected, the boat cracked and took on water and sank. The veterans and others, being responsible, immediately stopped the steamboat, assisted in rescue, and a worker named Chen reported to the Pingwang Su Jia Road Engineering Office together with the veterans. The workers claimed to have lost four stones of rice. The Engineering Office advised the steamboat to pay two stones of rice as a peaceful settlement. Unexpectedly, yesterday when returning to Bei Di, the worker named Chen suddenly gathered seventy or eighty people, forcing the veterans to pay compensation, threatening violence. Fortunately, the defense corps of the office suppressed the incident. The matter has not yet been resolved. We believe that it is common for road workers to gather crowds to commit violence. In this case, the veterans repeatedly refused to tow the boat to avoid danger. When forced to tow, they extorted money. In summary, their behavior is extremely absurd. The veterans and others' personal losses are small, but they are hindering traffic and disturbing travelers. If this is not strictly warned against, human rights will not be guaranteed. In addition to reporting to the bureau and forwarding a letter to the trade association requesting the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department to thoroughly investigate, we are reporting the situation. Based on this, we believe that road workers causing trouble by extorting money has been reported many times. This time, gathering crowds to extort money is clear evidence. There are many small boats entering and leaving the waterway. If this is not investigated, it will affect traffic. We are urgently telegraphing to you, requesting a quick investigation and punishment, dismissing the worker named Chen from his post and punishing him according to the law to ensure safe navigation and protect human rights. We are telegraphing anxiously, awaiting your order, Shanghai Inland River Steamboat Workers Union, Standing Directors Zhang Jinhua, Yu Jirong, Wan Wenqing, all bow down."</p>
<h3>Military Band to Perform in Zhaofeng Park</h3>
<p>During the summer season this year, a military band will perform every Sunday afternoon in Zhaofeng Park. The performance venue will be in the bandstand. Performances will be cancelled in case of rain. The venue can accommodate approximately 1,200 people. The first performance will be on Sunday, May 21st, at 3:30 p.m. An agreement has been reached with the band of the 2nd Battalion of the British Army Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. The commander of the regiment has approved. Tickets will be sold for four corners on the day of the performance, half price for children. If tickets are purchased at the park entrance, no additional fee will be charged for entry.</p>
<h3>The Child Welfare Association Sends a Letter to the Concession Authorities Requesting Relief for Child Prostitutes</h3>
<p>The Chinese Child Welfare Association has recently received letters from various sectors advocating for humanitarianism, reporting on underage girls who have been sold or forced into prostitution on the streets, in hotels, and in various game fields in the concessions. This not only infringes on their freedom but also harms their bodies. The association has always paid close attention to this and has already rescued many child prostitutes through the protection department, allowing them to escape from the fire pit. Now, it has gained the sympathy of people from all walks of life. In addition to formulating concrete measures, it is first writing to the concession authorities to request that they take steps to ban and investigate the following: "Respectfully, Shanghai is a place where people from all over the world gather, and there are good and bad people. When the moon is white and the lights are red, underage girls who have been sold or forced into prostitution, whether coerced by pimps or seduced by fortune tellers, fill the markets, constantly enticing people. The young masters and frivolous idlers, disregarding shame and humanity, flock to them. This phenomenon greatly hinders public order and good morals. Moreover, these child prostitutes have shallow knowledge and incomplete development and are mostly abducted from various places, either by force or by sale. They are oppressed by the environment and abused by the unlawful. It is not their wish, and their situation is pitiful. As a result, they are thin and have a variety of diseases. If measures are not taken to strictly prohibit this, it will harm society and destroy humanity. It is not a small matter. The association is responsible for child welfare and cannot bear to see these underage girls fall into the dust and be trampled upon. Therefore, we are writing to request that your police station investigate and strictly prohibit this in order to maintain morality."</p>

<h3>City Farmers Association Moves Its Location</h3>
<p>After holding the oath-taking ceremony for all the directors, deputy directors, chairmen, vice chairmen, and councilors of the City Farmers Association on the 9th of this month, it was originally intended to start work immediately. Because the original location was not suitable for use, it was moved yesterday to 128 Meijia Lane, Qiaojia Bang, Nanshi (inside the First District Party Department) to actively begin work.</p>
<h3>New Vault at the Reclamation Bank</h3>
<p>The China Reclamation Bank has been constructing a new eight-story building on its own land at the intersection of Beijing Road and Jiangxi Road for more than a year, and it is nearing completion. The sturdiness of the vault's construction and the perfection of its equipment are particularly noteworthy. It is understood that the vault door, safe deposit boxes, and all equipment were planned and supplied by the Mosler Safe Company of the United States, and a renowned American engineer specially dispatched by the Shanghai Shenchang &amp; Co., Ltd. supervised the installation. The vault is surrounded by 20-inch-thick reinforced concrete walls, with extra-thick steel plates installed inside, making it exceptionally strong. The entire vault is located on the second floor, which is high and dry, unlike those located in the basement. The steel plate of the vault door is more than ten inches thick and has a four-layer structure, consisting of various fire-resistant and anti-theft materials. The door is equipped with an extremely complex combination lock that can be changed up to 100,000,000 times. Even skilled craftsmen with the key would find it difficult to open without authorization from the responsible personnel. The vault is equipped with an alarm bell; if the vault wall is disturbed in the slightest, the alarm will automatically sound, alerting the outside. In addition, the interior is equipped with an air extraction door and high-speed electric fans to facilitate air circulation. The entire vault area is spacious and equipped with thousands of Mosler standard safe deposit boxes of various sizes. Each box is equipped with a Mosler-invented double-nosed lock that can be changed eight million times. Once a tenant terminates the lease, the mechanism is immediately changed, making it impossible to open even with the original key in hand. These are all characteristics of the new vault. Moreover, the rental price is particularly low, so many people have already made reservations in recent days.</p>
<h3>Apple Electric Fans Sell Well</h3>
<p>The China Apple Electric Appliance Factory was founded by Mr. Hu Xiyuan. It has been in operation for nearly ten years. With the strong support of directors such as Qin Runqing, Wang Boyuan, Liang Chenlan, and Hu Zu'an, the business is flourishing. The factory is actively expanding its light bulb department, building a new factory, and adding new machinery. Several years ago, it purchased land on Poyang Road to build a separate factory for the motor department, specializing in the manufacture of electric fans, stoves, motors, and other electrical appliances. Now that the weather is getting warmer, buyers from both the local area and other parts of the country are enthusiastically purchasing various Apple electric fans, and there is a strong trend of supply falling short of demand.</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhendong, Who Was Electrocuted to Death in a Thunderstorm the Other Day</h3>
<p>Hair Charred and Sulfur Smell Pervades</p>
<p>Judge Confirms Death by Electrocution</p>
<p>The weather the other day was unusually sultry. By 3 p.m., dark clouds gathered, and the sky turned dim. Before long, a torrential rain poured down, and flashes of lightning and deafening thunderclaps occurred simultaneously. After about half an hour, the shower stopped. However, while the lightning and thunder were raging, a man was struck and killed by lightning on the open space west of the Seventh District, Second Precinct Police Station on the north side of Yixiang Road in Pudong. After the rain stopped, the incident caused a sensation in the neighborhood. People who went to see the victim found that his hair was charred and a sulfur smell permeated the air. After an investigation by the police station, the man was identified as Zhang Zhendong, 23 years old, from Hubei Province. He worked as a mud carrier in the Xiehe Company, and his home was in a nearby shack. When the family was notified and questioned, they claimed that they did not know why the deceased had gone to that place, resulting in his death by lightning. Since the death occurred on the road, the police district ordered Chen Jinsheng, the land guard of the Twenty-third Bao Sixth Tu, to report the case to the District Court for examination. Prosecutor Wu and others, commissioned by the court, arrived at the scene and confirmed that the death was caused by electrocution. They ordered the family to take the body for burial.</p>

<h3>Convicts Sent to Pudong to Build Roads</h3>
<p>Approved for Trial Implementation by the Ministry</p>
<p>Xie Fuzi, the warden of the Second Prison of the Jiangsu Shanghai Special Zone, received approval from the Ministry to use convicts for road construction. He had consulted with the Municipal Public Works Bureau and agreed to start with a trial in Pudong. At 10 a.m. yesterday, he specially dispatched 50 selected convicts, including Gao Changfa, escorted by prison guards and police officers assigned by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, to the Dinghai Wharf in Yangshupu to cross the river to Pudong and be handed over to the Engineering Office of the Municipal Public Works Bureau for work.</p>
<h3>Liu Mingzhu's Divorce Appeal Still Rejected</h3>
<p>Liu Mingzhu, the daughter of Liu Huizhi, the general manager of the China Industrial Bank, requested a divorce from her husband, Duan Ao, from the Second Special Court on the grounds that he suffered from mental illness. However, Duan claimed that the allegations were untrue and hired lawyer Dong Yu to write a defense. After the first instance trial, the court rejected the plaintiff's claim. However, Liu was not satisfied and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. A hearing was held once last month. Since both parties were absent at that time, the hearing was rescheduled to continue the afternoon before yesterday. On that day, the appellant Liu Mingzhu arrived in court with lawyer Lu, while the appellee Duan Ao did not appear and was represented by lawyer Dong. The judge first questioned Duan and Liu, and Liu testified that her husband suffered from mental illness and beat people indiscriminately, injuring many. She feared that there was no hope of treatment, so she came to request a divorce. Then, lawyer Dong stood up and argued that Duan Ao was appointed as a military translator by Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek of the National Government in 1929, as evidenced by the letter of appointment (presented to the court at the time). This proved that Duan had no mental illness. Moreover, the appellant's claim that Duan had beaten people was entirely unfounded and had no supporting evidence, making it difficult to believe. Finally, the court declared the debate closed and announced its verdict yesterday afternoon, rejecting Liu's appeal.</p>
<h3>Continued Hearing on the Case of Huang Jiuzhitang's Mis-Prescription</h3>
<p>The Huang Jiuzhitang pharmacy on Zhejiang Road, south of Touji Bridge, had previously dispensed medicine for Weng Xieyao, the chief auditor of the Tianchan Theater. However, it was discovered that four ingredients were missing from the prescription by Dr. Zhang Peizhi, who was treating Weng's wife. He immediately sent someone to the pharmacy to make up for the missing ingredients. Unexpectedly, they replaced "Huangqin" (Scutellaria baicalensis) with North American ginseng. This mistake was repeated, treating life as a child's play. When Weng confronted them, they stubbornly defended themselves. Therefore, he took the shop's accountant, Zhou Zilin, to the Lao Zha Police Station. After being questioned by the police chief, he was ordered to file a private prosecution in the court. He then hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit against Cai Maohuai and Zhou Zilin, the assistant managers of Huang Jiuzhitang, for dereliction of duty. A hearing had been held once before, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui continued the hearing, and Dr. Zhang testified that the four missing medicines from Huang Jiuzhitang the first time were the most important ones. Although they later made up for the ingredients according to the prescription, they actually used Huangqin to replace North American ginseng, which was even more absurd. The properties of Huangqin and North American ginseng are completely different. Taking Huangqin would cause abdominal pain for the patient. Fortunately, it was discovered before the medicine was taken, and no disaster occurred. When questioned, the accused completely shifted the responsibility to Tang Wenkui alone, claiming that Tang dispensed the medicine and that Tang was a temporary worker in the shop who had left the shop on April 12 and his whereabouts were unknown. Judge Liu ordered a rescheduled hearing for the afternoon of May 29.</p>
<h3>The Case of Wu Jingxiong's Chauffeur's Tragic Death</h3>
<p>丨Russian Chauffeur Sentenced丨</p>
<p>Zhang A'wang, a 51-year-old man from Ningbo who worked as a chauffeur for Wu Jingxiong, was on his way home on a bicycle at around 10 p.m. on the 10th of this month after finishing his work. While passing through the intersection of Avenue Joffre and Dixifeng Road, he was suddenly run over by a Russian chauffeur named Stan Gremlin, driving public bus No. 15103, on the sidewalk, killing him. The Jing'an Temple Police Station sent the body to the Philander Road Morgue for examination. Prosecutor Guo, commissioned by the First Special Court, arrived at the morgue for examination and, considering that the Russian driver was suspected of negligence, ordered the police station to file a public prosecution according to law, as previously reported. The court had already concluded a hearing once. Yesterday morning, it was time for the verdict to be announced. Judge Huang Risheng took the stand in the Eighth Criminal Court and pronounced the judgment. The main text was that the Russian Stan Gremlin was guilty of causing death through negligence in his work and was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment. The incidental civil suit was transferred to the Civil Court for trial.</p>
<h3>Negotiations on the Case of the Tragic Death of French Police Officer Gao</h3>
<p>The Barber Association Handles the Matter According to Law</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, in the case of French police officer Milihong (transliteration) No. 39 in the French Concession kicking barber Gao Yatou to death at Qianjiatang, Avenue Albert, on the morning of May 7, the Yangzhou Fellow Association, the Barber Industry Association, the French Concession Street Vendors Union, and the Support Association for the Tragic Case have jointly formulated a negotiation plan. The family of the deceased has also hired lawyer Wu Kaisheng as their agent to handle the matter according to law. In addition, various groups have jointly invited three lawyers, Qian Shusheng, Song Shixiang, and E Sen, to handle the case together in order to actively pursue it. However, since the case occurred, it has been ten days, and although various parties have made serious representations to the French authorities, the French authorities have not made any concrete statements regarding the case. Therefore, the Shanghai Barber Industry Vindication Support Association for the Gao Case, in order to expedite the negotiation process and ensure the unanimous cooperation of all lawyers, specially appointed Jin Zhibao and Luo Xitao as representatives yesterday afternoon to contact the four lawyers, Wu, Qian, Song, and E, separately to request their cooperation and handle the matter according to law. According to the lawyers' opinions, it is planned to hold a discussion meeting to discuss the method of proceeding.</p>
<h3>A Boatman's Foot Crushed</h3>
<p>Leaving the Gate, He Couldn't Escape Disaster</p>
<p>Neighboring Boat Tried to Rescue Jinbao</p>
<p>Chen Zhanglin's kiln cargo boat, fully loaded with bricks and tiles from Zhejiang Province, was sailing on the South Huangpu River near the Shanghai Cement Factory yesterday morning when it stopped due to the rising tide and adverse current. Chen went ashore to buy goods, while two boatmen were on board to watch over the boat. One of them, named Jinbao, was sitting on the side of the bow washing clothes when a boat leaving the gate, fully loaded with flour, sailed southward quickly with the current. Due to a slight delay in turning the rudder, it directly collided with Chen's boat. Jinbao was unable to avoid it, and his feet were crushed, causing him to fall into the river in extreme pain. Seeing the accident, the other boat sped south and fled. Fortunately, Yang Hesheng from a neighboring boat saw it and went forward to rescue Jinbao, immediately taking Jinbao to the hospital. He also found Chen and informed him of the situation. Chen hired a small boat to chase south and, it was reported that he had chased the boat to the south of Dujiahang in the afternoon, apprehended the boat, and taken the boat owner to the police district for investigation. As for Jinbao, his feet were crushed, and it was said that one foot was crushed and the bone was shattered, and that he might be disabled.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Annual Meeting of the Chinese Statistical Society</h3>
<p>The Chinese Statistical Society is the only group in the statistical community in our country. The third annual meeting has already been held in Beijing. The meeting was held for several days. The situation is as follows: At 8 a.m. on the 13th, the opening ceremony was held at the Capital Academy of Political Accounting. About 100 people attended the meeting. Wang Zhongwu was elected as the chairman and delivered the opening speech. He said that the status of statistical science has been deeply recognized in today's Chinese society. Plans in all aspects of politics and economics are based on statistical figures as indicators. And the people who move this indicator are statisticians. Moreover, at a time when our country is in a national crisis, the preparation for wartime mobilization and the plan for maintaining the rural economy all require extremely numerical references. Therefore, the colleagues of this society should bear this heavy burden and serve the nation. There are three characteristics of this year's annual meeting that can be reported, namely (1) Strictly defining the qualifications of members, and members who join must have in-depth research and have made considerable contributions, (2) Focusing on academic research, the work of members is to study statistical science and clarify theories, without involving other affairs, (3) Fully preparing for the papers for this annual meeting. The papers read this time are all carefully crafted by the members, with unique insights, which can be used as a reference for the society. Then, Wang Luyi, a representative from the central government, delivered a speech, saying that the origin of statistics in our country is very ancient, but it has only recently become prosperous. This kind of work is even more necessary now. The Chinese Statistical Society is the crystallization of the statistical community in our country, and all the results of its research will definitely be the compass for all aspects of the country. Again, Minister of Education Wang Shijie delivered a speech, saying that there are many difficulties in the statistical undertaking in China. The first is that the general public does not understand the importance of statistics, and the second is the lack of talents engaged in this undertaking. If we want to make the statistical undertaking more and more glorious, we must break through the two difficulties. The scholars in the society are all well-known people, and I hope that they will work hard to move forward so that the statistical undertaking in China can shine in the world. Afterwards, representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters and various agencies delivered speeches in succession. After that, the results of the election of the fourth session of the Society Affairs Committee were announced. Wang Zhongwu received 53 votes, Liu Dajun 51 votes, Wu Dajun 34 votes, Zhu Junyi 33 votes, Sun Zheng 30 votes, Sheng Jun 25 votes, Zhang Xinyi 23 votes, and Lin Wei 22 votes. They were elected as members of the Society Affairs Committee. After counting the votes, it was already 12 o'clock, and the Academy of Political Accounting feasted the members at the Central Hotel. In the afternoon, the reading of papers began. The papers included Zhu Zihui's "Comparison of Two Statistical Landscapes", Chu Yifei's "Matching Problems of Wave-type Curves" and "Algebraic Function Interpolation", Chen Huayin's "Trial Compilation of Economic Status Index", Zhu Junyi's "Statistical Research on the Years of Life of Famous People in China", Wu Dajun's "Environment and Thoughts of Chinese Youth" (a statistical observation), and other papers. The members also developed and discussed the topics, and the spirit was quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p>On the morning of the 14th, the reading of papers continued. The first was Wang Zhongwen's "Analysis of the Survey of Modern Chinese People", followed by Chen Zhengmo's "General Study on the Materials for Estimating the Population of Our Country", Chen Changheng's "Comparative Study of Population Statistics Since the Late Qing Dynasty", Chen Huayin's "Sex Ratio at Birth of Intellectual Class Population", Luo Zhiru's "Research on Simple Life Tables", Zhu Zihui's "Recent Wage Statistics of Chinese Official Offices", Wang Xichen's "Infant Mortality Rate in Nanjing", Liu Dajun's "New Method of Partial Correlation of Clothing Talent", Zheng Yanfen's "How to Estimate the Total Amount of Narcotics Needed in the World" and its Improper Consumption, etc., all of which were extremely valuable contributions. The meeting closed in the afternoon. At the same time, the fourth session of the Society Affairs Committee held a meeting, electing Wang Zhongwu as the president, Wu Dajun as the vice president, Zhu Junyi as the accountant, Sun Zheng as the document officer, and Sheng Jun, Zhang Xinyi, and Lin Wei as committee members. Liu Dajun was re-elected for three consecutive years. The meeting was adjourned after the election.</p>
<h3>The International Trade Bureau Publishes the U.S. Prohibition on the Import of Rice Straw Packaging Regulations</h3>
<p>The International Trade Bureau stated that the U.S. Consulate in Luo'anqi stated in a letter that from July 1 of this year, the import of various goods is prohibited from using plants or plant products as packaging materials. This has been reported in the previous newspaper. Now, the bureau, in order to draw the attention of Chinese merchants to the fact that many of our country's export goods use this material as packaging, has specially translated and published the full text of the announcement and the attached regulations as follows:</p>
<h3>Announcement</h3>
<p>The U.S. Packaging Material Quarantine Office, Announcement No. 69, stated that various plant products used as packaging materials, which are shipped from overseas, are prone to carrying germs, insects, or plant seedlings, which is related to the future of national agriculture and is very dangerous. Therefore, the import of plants has been banned in recent years. The import of dishes and vegetables must not be attached with green leaves. Eastern rice straw, used as packaging, has been found to carry germs in many surveys, and in large quantities. This germ is called (Rice Borer), which is a kind of plant parasite that is not easy to kill and is very harmful to plants. This germ is commonly found in rice-producing areas, but has not yet affected the American fields. In order to prevent malfeasance, all kinds of rice straw husks and chaff are prohibited from being imported. In addition to rice straw husks, etc., other items such as tree leaves, grass, mustard, and soil are also easy to carry plant germs, and they are also included in the ban. The use of these materials as packaging is far less common than rice straw, etc. Although the ban still has other items to replace, it will not affect commercial transportation in any way. In addition, items such as sugarcane, sorghum, cotton, and bamboo are subject to special regulations by the Quarantine Office and are also included in the ban. Regarding the above packaging materials, they must not be attached with plant germs. Inspectors have considerable authority to carry out all inspection procedures. Most ordinary items, such as various fillings, paper, wood chips, cork, firewood, and other kinds, are difficult to carry plant germs and are not within the scope of inspection.</p>
<h3>Regulations</h3>
<p>Article 1: From July 1, 1933, goods imported into the United States from all countries or regions must not use the following plants or plant products as packaging materials: (A) Rice straw, husks, and bran, etc. (all countries); (B) Millet (such as corn, sorghum, broomcorn, and other similar plants), except for imports from Mexico, Central America, South America, and the West Indies; other countries are not allowed to import them; (C) Cotton and cotton products (such as flax, waste cotton, cotton seeds, and cottonseed hulls, etc.) (all countries); (D) Sugarcane (including all parts of sugarcane and sugarcane dregs) (all countries); (E) Bamboo (including bamboo leaves and bamboo shoots) (all countries); (F) Plant leaves (all countries); (G) Tree bark (all countries); (H) Soil (containing a large amount of chlorophyll) (all countries).</p>
<p>Article 2: From July 1, 1933, goods imported into the United States from all countries or regions may use the following plants or plant products as packaging materials and in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the Quarantine Office: (1) Grain grasses, chaff, bran, and husks, excluding rice (such as wheat, buckwheat, barley, rye) (all countries); (2) Millet (such as corn, sorghum, broomcorn, etc.) (limited to those from Mexico, Central America, South America, and the West Indies); (3) Willow branches (limited to those from Europe); (4) Various dried fodders and herbaceous plants (all countries); (5) Soil (containing a large amount of plant matter, but only to the extent that it complies with the Quarantine Office's appendices and regulations).</p>
<h3>Explanation</h3>
<p>Article 1: Definitions. Section 1: The term "packaging material" in this chapter includes all the above-mentioned plants and plant products used in the shipment of goods as filling, binding, and for protection against moisture and breakage, etc. Section 2: Soil containing a significant amount of plant matter specifically refers to a type of soil containing decayed plant matter and carrying the risk of infectious bacteria. Pure mineral soil, etc., are not within the scope of quarantine. Section 3: Inspector. An inspector refers to an inspector from the United States Department of Agriculture.</p>
<p>Article 2: Exemption from germs. All imported packaging materials must not carry pests and plant pathogens.</p>
<p>Article 3: Import Inspection. All packaging materials imported must undergo inspection procedures.</p>
<p>Article 4: Handling of violations. For imported goods whose packaging materials violate the provisions of this regulation, and are confirmed by the inspector to carry infectious diseases or plant pathogens, the Quarantine Office may refuse the import of the goods, destroy the packaging materials, or perform other re-packaging and disinfection procedures.</p>
<p>Article 5: Regulations for soil used as filling material. The Quarantine Office stipulates that the following soil may be used as filling material: (1) Peat; (2) Peat moss; (3) Gsmuda Tidre.</p>
<p>Note: This regulation will take effect on July 1, 1933.</p>

<h3>Father and Son Capture Rapist</h3>
<p>Wang Fuju Molests Ms. Wang</p>
<p>Zhang Wanshan, 43 years old from Yangzhou, residing in Lang Ping's house in Fan Lane, Shanghai West, has a son named Fuchun, who is married to Ms. Wang, 23 years old. She used to work in a yarn factory and was exceptionally diligent and simple. Unexpectedly, a fellow villager, Wang Fuju, recently began to harass her. Yesterday afternoon around 5 o'clock, when Ms. Wang was alone at home, Wang Fuju dared to break in and forcibly rape her. As she was struggling to resist, Zhang and his son returned home and caught him in the act. They immediately seized Wang and Ms. Wang, called the police, and detained them in the Sixth District. After questioning by Officer Jiang, they immediately prepared a document and transferred them to the local court for further investigation.</p>
<h3>City News</h3>
<p>▲ Grand Price Reduction at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Domestic Goods Market: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Domestic Goods Market has been holding a summer grand price reduction for 21 days since May 15th. Yesterday was the first day of the price reduction, and customers flocked to purchase domestic goods, shoulder to shoulder and heel to toe, with the market almost bursting with people. The silk and cloth sections were especially crowded, presumably because the weather is hot and summer clothing urgently needs to be made. Furthermore, customers praised the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's market as a purely domestic goods merchant association, with genuine goods and low prices, emphasizing practicality and avoiding falsehoods. Total daily sales reached over 6,100 yuan, which can be described as an unprecedented grand occasion. Furthermore, the fourth floor of the market is a product showroom. Recently, superior Jiangxi porcelain destined for the Chicago Exposition in the United States is displayed there, including a 12-foot-high statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, dozens of Jingdezhen porcelain models, a longevity plate made for Empress Dowager Cixi's birthday, and other items, which are truly rare. The 12-foot-high statue was offered to be purchased for 3,000 yuan in Nanjing, but the industry representative has not agreed to sell it, showing its extreme value. Therefore, recently, the number of visitors every day is about more than one thousand people.</p>
<p>▲ The Birth of Improved Domestic Oiled Paper: Oiled paper is a necessary product for industrial and commercial packaging. In recent years, imported oiled paper has flooded the market, causing the decline of domestic oiled paper and severely impacting domestic manufacturers. Shanghai's Tong Yi Tai Paper Store, etc., in view of this situation, used scientific methods and carefully researched, resulting in excellent results. The factory was named Tong Chang Domestic Improved Oiled Paper Factory. Sample papers were distributed to paper stores and users in various ports, all of whom were extremely satisfied. Its advantages are fourfold: (1) Oiled paper can generate heat when stored for a long time, and if not cared for regularly, it often self-ignites; (2) Ordinary oiled paper often becomes sticky between April and August due to the weather, causing it to clump together, but this improved domestic oiled paper has none of the above two problems; (3) The paper is strong and thick and does not stick to the touch; (4) The price is low. A large amount of capital has been pooled to set up a factory for manufacturing. Currently, the distribution office is located at Nos. 134 and 135 North Henan Road in this city. It is heard that merchants in various ports are eagerly seeking to become managers, which is also a fortunate event in the promotion of domestic goods.</p>

<h3>National Humiliation Week Lecture Mr. Chen Binhe Speaks on September 18th</h3>
<p>Lecture at the YMCA on May 10 (continued)</p>
<p>A third thought: Before September 18th, it seemed that we had no national crisis! Everyone was living in a drunken dream, only caring about enjoying themselves. After September 18th, we suffered a de facto severe national crisis, losing one-thirteenth of our territory, one-twelfth of our population, and one-quarter of our property! Having suffered such a major national crisis, we should ask: What are the differences between the general situation before and after September 18th? Facts tell us that after September 18th, the Japanese government changed all factories in the country into factories manufacturing military supplies, and intensified the training of young people across the country, using various methods to incite the people to act against China. Everywhere shows a state of war. What about our government? After September 18th, a national crisis conference was held, many written protests were filed with the League of Nations, and many declarations were issued, advising the people to remain calm. Japanese scholars (not those hired by the government) advocated justice and opposed the government's policy of aggression. They advised the Japanese people not to blindly follow the government's policy of aggression. However, our scholars advocated peace talks, advocated acknowledging the facts, acknowledging the Twenty-One Demands, and advocated "we will wait another fifty years!" Let's see again, what did the Japanese bourgeoisie do after September 18th? They took out money to help the warlords invade China because they were of the same life. Our bourgeoisie still do their speculative business and live their lives of enjoyment! Let's see again, what about the Japanese working masses? Because Japanese imperialists want to expand their aggression and increase military spending, the working masses have not gained any benefits from the aggressive war but have increased their burden. The Chinese working masses, such as those in Zhabei and in the Northeast, directly suffered the ravages of imperialism. Or they indirectly suffered great pain, so the Chinese and Japanese working masses suffered equally after September 18th. Therefore, we know that only the Chinese and Japanese working masses can unite to smash Japanese imperialists and all traitors.</p>
<p>These thoughts are all unpleasant to hear. I now have another more pleasant thought, that is, after September 18th, the Northeast Volunteer Army and Ma Zhanshan, Su Bingwen, etc. rose up to resist, and the 19th Route Army rose up to resist on January 28th. This kind of struggle for self-defense to protect their own nation and country has been supported by the people of the whole country, sympathized with by the international community, and admired by the Japanese people!</p>
<p>We can now know that, from the perspective of a few thoughts, the only way we can go in the future is to fight for national survival! The history of the last few hundred years tells us that when the American Revolutionary War of 1778 failed, the French officer Lafayette said that the life of the American army was very hard, the soldiers were not full, and their clothes were not complete, and their skin was frozen black; but they all had a belief in demanding freedom and justice. They finally achieved victory through arduous and extraordinary efforts. When the Soviet Revolution took place, imperialist countries rose up to intervene by force. The Soviet Union had to resist as many as twelve fronts in the most difficult times, but it also achieved victory in the end. Turkey fought hard for three years in the war with Greece after the European War before declaring victory and becoming an independent country.</p>
<p>We now only have to fight for national survival. Only struggle is our way out, and only struggle can we survive!</p>
<p>After the September 18th Incident, Japan had two observations on China: The general warlords observed that the Chinese army was of no use in national defense, but was only a tool for the warlords to engage in political struggles in the country. They also said that the history of China is a history of being ruled by foreign nations in a cycle, a history of obeying all plans set by foreign nations. They also said that China is an unorganized country. Therefore, they despise China as not being their opponent! Another type of observation is from Japanese scholars. They believe that the September 18th Incident is of no benefit to Japan, but is like swallowing a bomb, but is sufficient to promote the unity of leaders from all parties in China, giving China an opportunity for unified cooperation, and giving China an opportunity for revitalization and innovation.</p>
<p>We don't know which of the two observations that the enemy made about us is correct!</p>
<p>The American War of Independence, the Soviet Revolutionary War, and the Turkish War of Resistance against Greece, we know from the facts in history! We know that the land we lost before can only be taken back by war in the future! We should understand that what we desire is the freedom and equality of China. This is a very valuable thing that cannot be obtained by paying a small price; we should prepare for the greatest sacrifice to repay this greatest price!</p>
<p>We still have to go through many setbacks, and we still have to go through many struggles before we can achieve national freedom and equality! (Recorded by Ye Wenxiong and Zhang Kuishi)</p>

<h3>Two Types of People</h3>
<p>— Bofu</p>
<p>In literature, there are two main types: prose and poetry. The same is true of people; there are two types: those with a prose temperament and those with a poet's temperament. A prose person is one who conforms himself to the world, while a poetic person is one who calls the world to conform to himself. For someone who conforms to the world, his ethics are extremely simple, namely, taking the good and bad of society as good and bad; his life is also extremely simple, namely, taking the life of society as his life; his purpose is even simpler, namely, taking what society calls success as success. Such a person has a simple purpose, a simple mind, and a simple spirit, but he is often the most successful person in society. As for someone with a poetic temperament, he wants the world to conform to himself, so he inevitably looks down on all life in the world, and thus is inevitably an idealist, a dreamer, and someone with a sensitive mind. His mind is complex, and his spirit is even more complex. He struggles throughout his life without knowing what his purpose is, and thus he only fails. Don't you often hear some county magistrates say, "We can't bear to take the money that others have the heart to take, so we're poor." That's right, this is what is called a poetic temperament.</p>
<p>A prose person outwardly flatters the poetic temperament, so he can get close to this kind of person to steal from him, rob him, and fool him. And he always flatters him highly on the altar of purity, lest he come down and cause trouble for his own career. China has been a land of humanity since ancient times, and scholars have always been held in high esteem, probably in this way.</p>
<p>A person with a poetic temperament looks down on this prose temperament, but he has no choice but to despise and scold him. As a result, the prose person takes advantage of what he disdains to do, does it himself, and thus succeeds in society.</p>
<p>The bad thing about a prose person is his dullness. As the saying goes, let him laugh and scold as he pleases, I will be a good official on my own. The bad thing about a poetic person is his vanity. He thinks he is not willing to be stained by the vulgar, so he becomes a straggler. He thinks he is pure, so he becomes a parasite.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, I am reminded of a story from my student days. When I was in Tokyo, my fellow villagers, classmates, those studying literature, and those studying martial arts were all at their peak. One day, we all gathered together for a chat. Among them, there was someone studying martial arts, whom we considered a straightforward and reckless man. He told us his future purpose with the unique dullness of a prose person. He said a lot frankly, which can be summarized as "getting promoted and getting rich."</p>
<p>Among us, there was also a gentleman studying literature, who probably couldn't bear to listen anymore, so he ridiculed him in a literary way, "Life is not just about getting promoted and getting rich!" What a poetic statement!</p>
<p>But do you know how that innocent and reckless man replied? He immediately replied, "You're right, naturally there's also marrying a wife, riding in a car, living in a Western-style house, etc. But if I get promoted and get rich, these things will naturally come."</p>
<p>He was not being humorous; he was just being frank. We laughed at him for being innocent, but in fact, we were all fooled by him. This is his secret to success.</p>
<p>Sure enough, I heard that he is now an official. And our gentleman studying literature is currently lacking food, even his wife looks down on him, and I heard that they are going to get divorced.</p>
<h3>Digging Bunkers and Buying Airplanes</h3>
<p>— Shiyi</p>
<p>Opening the newspaper, there are two lines of alarming headlines again: "Enemy forces are taking a surrounding shape on Pingjin, Japanese planes scout Peiping."</p>
<p>But looking closely, I realized that this news not only doesn't require us who read the newspaper on both sides to be alarmed, but even Peiping, where the planes are flying overhead, is "the officials are also very calm, and there is no sign of panic." This shows that although the troops of Japanese imperialism have been making steady progress on Chinese soil recently, the progress of the Chinese people's calmness skills is increasing day by day. According to the regulations by which a certain Central Committee member praised the calmness of Xuzhou students, an order should be given to commend them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the fly in the ointment is that the principals of the elementary schools in Peiping have gone to the Social Bureau to petition to "dig bunkers" in the schools, which is somewhat lacking in calmness; but it is not likely to alarm friendly nations to hide in bunkers to seek safety, and it may be appropriate to do so.</p>
<p>Digging a large bunker in every elementary school, moving the classrooms underground, and studying and reading with peace of mind regardless of the planes and bombs overhead, waiting quietly to study hard and save the country, to "recover lost territory," is truly a more tragic spectacle than Daudet's "The Last Lesson."</p>
<p>From the fact that elementary school students in Peiping are attending classes in bunkers, I am reminded of elementary school students in Shanghai raising donations in the streets. They forcibly drag people to throw some money into their bamboo tubes, saying that they will use it to buy airplanes to save the country.</p>
<p>If people bring airplanes, and we also bring airplanes to confront them, this is also a way to save the country.</p>
<p>But other people's airplanes have already flown over Peiping City, and our airplanes are still in the bamboo tubes of the elementary school students, how can it not make people sweat profusely with anxiety!</p>
<p>Someone said: You are wrong. Buying airplanes is not really going to fight against Japanese airplanes, but rather waiting until all of China's land is lost, and there is nowhere to place the Chinese nation, then like the "Noah's Ark" in the time of the Great Flood in ancient times, "sovereignty," "the people," etc. are all moved into the airplane to sail in the air. Therefore, it is called air rescue. If it is really for this purpose, we should indeed donate a few more dollars and buy a few more airplanes, lest there be nowhere to dig bunkers in the future.</p>
<h3>Azalea</h3>
<p>— Zhou Guangxi</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the blood-red azaleas, we went to Tianping Mountain for a day of fun.</p>
<p>I didn't have much lingering attachment to Tianping Mountain itself, but facing the azaleas on the way back, those azaleas that covered the hillside like shattered brocade under the setting sun in Shenxi, I felt a bit reluctant to leave.</p>
<p>I bent down and heartlessly picked a large handful of those tender azaleas, wanting to bring them back to Shanghai as a souvenir, but what good would that do? Once in Shanghai, these beautiful flowers would wither beyond recognition.</p>
<p>A melancholy mood, coupled with the desire to possess these flowers and leaves for a long time, made me even more cruel, digging up a budding plant with its roots. Although she clung tightly to the soil, she was finally carried on my cane all the way to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Upon returning to my Shanghai residence, I immediately planted her in a flowerpot, carefully placed in a cool spot on the balcony, watering her every day, hoping that this transplanted azalea could give me some comfort in this depressing city.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the day after leaving Tianping Mountain, her flowers withered, and on the third and fourth days, her leaves withered. A week later, only a few dry and barren branches remained in the pot, ugly as the dry bones of the dead. Despite diligent watering, her life could not be saved. This suffocating city, this small flowerpot, was too unfamiliar to her, and she finally transformed into something lifeless.</p>
<p>Then I thought of the sedan chair carriers at the foot of Tianping Mountain, those sturdy, lively, honest, and simple women, each possessing a kind of vitality, a vitality of youthful life, which people in the city lack. But if these women were moved to the city, they would lose their strength, liveliness, honesty, and simplicity, and they would lose their youthful vitality. We only need to look at the female workers and maids from the countryside working in Shanghai factories and households to know this. Just like the azaleas on the mountain, which bloom with bright and beautiful flowers in nature, despite wind and rain, sun and dew, once moved to the city, they wither.</p>
<p>Because of the bankruptcy of the rural economy, because of the temptation of Shanghai's prosperity, every day, every hour, countless strong women are transported from the countryside, from the interior, to this city by trains and ships, to sacrifice their youth, their health and beauty, and even their lives!</p>
<p>Isn't this the same fate as the azaleas?</p>
<p>If people are like this, what does an azalea matter?</p>
<p>Looking at the withered azalea, my heart is filled with endless melancholy!</p>
<h3>About Chinese Bees</h3>
<p>— Li Xi</p>
<p>I once talked about the story of "robber bees," saying that Italian bees drove away Chinese bees. In fact, Chinese bees are always so unprogressive, and even without the introduction of Italian bees, there is always the possibility of extinction.</p>
<p>Chinese bees have too many enemies. The most harmful is the cotton worm, which often lives in the lower part of the beehive, gnawing through the beehive and stealing honey and pollen. They grow and develop, and when they occupy the honeycomb, the bees can do nothing but lead their colony to escape. Next is the honey moth, which is one or two inches long. When it invades, it also sucks honey and breaks the nest wax. The bees usually avoid it. Furthermore, swallows, sparrows, dragonflies, frogs, centipedes, snakes, and toads are all mortal enemies of bees. Among them, the toad is the most skillful and ruthless, opening its mouth and lazily waiting at the entrance of the beehive, waiting for the bees to crawl out of the hole, ready to work. It swallows them in one easy bite. A toad can eat more than fifty bees a day. Next is the "nine-mile bee". This kind of bee is more common near the mountains, smaller and fiercer than the honey moth. If one comes in, the only thing the beehive can do is escape quickly.</p>
<p>The things that Chinese bees fear, Italian bees don't take seriously at all. Italian bees have no other strengths, their only strength is working together to defend against enemies.</p>
<p>Chinese bees never have large colonies. As soon as they become slightly prosperous, they split again and again: one colony leaves today, another colony disappears tomorrow. Even the most experienced beekeepers can't guarantee when they will swarm. Small colonies, weak strength, and weak resistance also lead to poor work efficiency. When winter comes and food is scarce, they implement a suicidal policy: "gnawing wax." Chinese bees barely survive the winter, at least half of the worker bees die.</p>
<p>Recently, some people have started to improve them, believing that for Chinese bees to thrive and unite, unless each bee is coated with some sugar, perhaps they will see the sugar and suck each other, and will not leave for a while. Or sprinkle some glue on each bee's wings, so that they cannot be separated, in order to make them accustomed to group action.</p>
<p>However, this also requires foreigners to do it. In China, even people have always lacked things like sugar and glue.</p>
<h3>Carrot Top</h3>
<p>— Jules Renard, translated by Lin Quzuo</p>
<p>Arrangements (continued)</p>
<p>"When Mr. Lepic takes off his dirty leather shoes, I take them to the hallway, but Sister Ernestine would never let anyone else take the right to get slippers for Father. She embroidered flowers on these slippers herself.</p>
<p>"I take on some important errands that require long trips, such as to the pharmacist or doctor's house.</p>
<p>"You, on the other hand, are responsible for going to the village to buy small things.</p>
<p>"But regardless of whether it's sunny or raining, you have to go to the river to wash clothes for two or three hours every day. This is the most difficult task in your job, poor child; I can't help you with this at all. But if I have time, I can sometimes help you hang the clothes on the fence.</p>
<p>"I've thought of something: I'll give you a piece of advice. Don't dry the clothes on the fruit trees. Mr. Lepic won't blame you, but he will gently throw them on the ground, and when Mrs. Lepic finds a trace on the clothes, she will tell you to wash them again.</p>
<p>"Also, about the shoes, I have to give you a few words of advice. For the shoes you wear when hunting, you have to apply a lot of oil. Ordinary shoes only need a little polish.</p>
<p>"Don't clean those muddy pants too thoroughly. Mr. Lepic believes that pants covered in mud are more durable. He walks in those plowed fields and never ties up his trouser legs. When Mr. Lepic asks me to carry the game bag and follow him hunting, I would rather tie up my trouser legs.</p>
<p>"He said to me: 'Carrot Top, you will never become a true hunter.'</p>
<p>"And Mrs. Lepic said to me: 'Watch your ears, if you get yourself dirty.'</p>
<p>"It's a matter of taste for everyone.</p>
<p>"In short, you won't be too tired. When I'm home on vacation, you can share half of my work, and when my sister, brother, and I all go to school to stay, you can do less work. The result is the same.</p>
<p>"And no one will be too bad to you. If you ask the friends who come and go in our house, they will all guarantee you: my sister Ernestine is as gentle as an angel, my brother Felix has the best heart, Mr. Lepic has an upright spirit and sound judgment, and Mrs. Lepic has rare cooking skills. Perhaps I am the one in the family who you find the most difficult to deal with. Actually, I'm not like that. You just need to understand my personality. Besides, I am reasonable, I will change, and, without being immodest, I will make myself better, if you are a little humble, we can work together harmoniously.</p>
<p>"No, don't call me 'Sir'. Just call me Carrot Top like everyone else. It's shorter than 'Young Master Lepic'. But I ask you not to talk to me in that dismissive tone like your grandmother Olorin. Your grandmother's words often hurt me, I hate her very much."</p>

<h3>University Association Cables Russian Ambassador Opposing Russian Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>▲According to the Agreement, the Railway is Jointly Owned by China and Russia</p>
<p>▲I Absolutely Cannot Recognize Unilateral Handling</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Student Union, in response to the Soviet Union's violation of the agreement and sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, yesterday sent a special telegram to the Soviet Russian Ambassador to China, Bogomolov, in Nanjing, expressing opposition and requesting that the authorities of that country reconsider their attitude on this issue. The original telegram is summarized as follows: (Omitted address) "The issue of the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway has been widely publicized internationally. According to a recent Reuters dispatch from Moscow, a conversation from Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov stated that the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway is an undeniable fact. Article 9, Section 5 of the 1924 Sino-Russian Agreement states that the sovereignty of the Chinese Eastern Railway belongs to the Republic of China and the Soviet Socialist Republic of the Soviet Union. The railway is jointly owned by China and Russia and cannot be disposed of without agreement. Now, in violation of the agreement and in disregard of good faith, the railway has been sold without authorization, intending to conclude an illegal act with an illegal organization. The Chinese people absolutely cannot recognize it and will seriously oppose it. We dare to request that your government pay attention to the agreement, reconsider its attitude on this issue, maintain sovereignty, and promote friendly relations. We are very eager to do so. Respectfully, the Shanghai University Student Union."</p>

<h3>The Rapid Progress of the Wusong Merchant Marine School of the Ministry of Communications</h3>
<p>▲Excellent Students Have Great Career Prospects</p>
<p>▲Opening High School and Enrolling Vocational Students</p>
<p>The Merchant Marine School is a specialized school directly under the Ministry of Communications, with the purpose of training maritime talents. It was founded in the late Qing Dynasty and discontinued for more than ten years after the early Republic. In the 18th year of the Republic, the Ministry of Communications, in view of the need for maritime personnel, reopened it. It is divided into (Navigation Department) and (Mechanical Engineering Department), both of which graduate in four years (two years of schoolwork and two years of internship). After graduation, the Ministry issues corresponding seafarer certificates, which allow them to serve as seafarers of corresponding ranks on ocean-going and coastal ships (such as second mate, chief mate, ship master, second engineer, chief engineer, and chief engineer).</p>
<p>▲The positions of the graduates are as follows: The graduates of the early Republic are now serving as shipowners, chief shipowners, pilots, etc. Their reputation and achievements are recognized by the Chinese people. For example, the current chief shipowner of Zhaoxing Company, Mr. Chen Ganqing, the chief shipowner of Ning Shao Company, Mr. Shen Jiyun, the director of the Jianghai Customs Pilotage Bureau, Mr. Lin Guojie, the director of the China Merchants Bureau, Mr. Yang Zhixiong, and the current principal of the school, Mr. Xu Zufan, all graduated from the school in the early Republic. The school's admission requirements and treatment are described below:</p>
<p>▲Admission Qualifications: Graduates of accredited high schools or equivalent schools may apply for the first year during the recruitment period.</p>
<p>▲Tuition, Room and Board, and Miscellaneous Fees: No tuition, room and board, or any miscellaneous fees such as lecture notes and sports are charged. Students pay 25 yuan per semester for meals (the school subsidizes an additional 10 yuan). Students in the Navigation Department who are assigned to various ships for internships and students in the Mechanical Engineering Department who are assigned to factories for internships have separate regulations for meal and accommodation subsidies. Uniform and book fees are approximately several tens of yuan per academic year. The first class of students in the Navigation Department are currently assigned to various bureaus and company ships such as China Merchants, Ning Shao, Zhaoxing, Zhengji, and Sanbei for internships. Some have already taken on the duties of seafarers.</p>
<p>▲The Graduates of This Session Already Have a Future: The aforementioned first class of students will formally graduate in the summer of this year, and most have already obtained seafarer positions. The second class of students in the Navigation Department are currently interning on the China Merchants Bureau's Fairness ship. Since this spring, Principal Xu and the China Merchants authorities have consulted and agreed, and the Ministry of Communications has approved the designation of the Fairness ship to accommodate the school's students for internships. The above are the past and present situations of the school.</p>
<p>▲Opening an Affiliated High School: It is also heard that the school's original preparatory course has been abolished. Now, in order to broaden training and facilitate sequential promotion to higher education, the Ministry of Communications has approved the addition of an affiliated high school, which will enroll students and open classes in the summer of this year. At the same time, the Navigation Department and the Mechanical Engineering Department must also recruit new students.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Law College Recovers School Buildings</h3>
<p>丨All School Buildings Destroyed in the January 28th Incident丨</p>
<p>丨Will Soon Be Fully Restored丨</p>
<p>▲Decided to Restore the Library Collection at the Same Time</p>
<p>▲Moving Back to Jiangwan Road Office at the End of June</p>
<p>The Shanghai Law College (formerly known as the Law University) on Jiangwan Road in Zhabei was founded by Chu Fucheng and Shen Junru. Originally without a single tile or beam, they rented houses for lectures. Over the years, the two men worked hard to build school buildings on the rented land. In the spring of the 19th year, the classrooms and student dormitories were completed at the same time. The classrooms could accommodate more than 1,650 people, and the dormitories could accommodate more than 600 people. The remaining dormitories were temporarily rented. In the winter of that year, the Ministry of Education sent personnel to investigate and recognized the excellent results, and specially approved the registration to encourage them. In the autumn of the previous year, a large auditorium was added, with a magnificent and resplendent architecture, also capable of accommodating more than 1,650 people. It was also planned to continue building a library and student dormitory in the spring of the next year, because the school had more than 1,040 students at the time, and the dormitories were deeply inadequate. Unexpectedly, not long after the completion of the auditorium, the original aspiration was not fulfilled, and the January 28th Incident suddenly broke out. Three days later, the Japanese army used machine guns and flamethrowers to burn it, causing the school, built with years of effort, to be completely destroyed in two days and nights, with a loss of more than 400,000 yuan. Despite the pain, the two men still worked hard to maintain it and did not lose heart because of it. It is now learned that the school is more actively handling the matter and has decided to rebuild the school buildings. A contract has been signed with the Meichang Construction Company at the end of last month to start construction immediately and rebuild on the original site. All classrooms, auditoriums, dormitories, offices, etc. have been further improved and restored to their original appearance. The construction must be completed by the end of August so that it can be used when school starts in the next semester. The required construction cost of 150,000 yuan has been arranged by the school authorities and the Restoration Committee. The school is scheduled to move back to the original site on Jiangwan Road at the end of June to take care of the progress of the project. It is heard that the school has also decided to restore all the collections of the destroyed library at the same time, and is currently making every effort to solicit and collect them, and plans to allocate funds to build a large-scale independent library building in the shortest possible time.</p>

<h3>Chaoyang College of Peiping to Establish a Branch in Shanghai This Summer</h3>
<p>It is recently learned that Chaoyang College of Peiping is preparing to establish a branch in Shanghai. This college is formerly Chaoyang University of Beijing, a renowned law school in the old capital, founded in the second year of the Republic by Wang Youling, Jiang Yong, and others. The current president is Jiang Yong, and the chairman of the board is Huang Fu. The college emphasizes practicality and has been earnest in its management and perfect in its operations for twenty years. It has repeatedly received awards and commendations from the former Ministries of Education and Law, as well as the current Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Judicial Administration. Its graduates have achieved outstanding results, especially in the judicial examinations. Since the establishment of the Republic, only seven formal examinations have been held, and graduates of this school have won the first place six times. They have also repeatedly obtained top marks in the civil service or county magistrate examinations in Beijing, Peiping, and Shandong. At the Hague Conference in the eighteenth year, the French jurist Escarra specifically cited this school as the best law school in China in his report to the international community. It is heard that the school still has more than 2,000 students. Recently, due to the invasion of the Japanese bandits, approaching northern Hebei, in order to facilitate the students who are eager to enroll in the college this summer, it has been decided to establish a branch in Shanghai this summer. The location has been found on Yaozhu Jiao Road, and arrangements have been finalized. A preparatory office has been set up in Liu's residence at No. 1 Yilu, Ying'er Dong Road, in the French Concession, and all preparations are actively underway. New students will soon be recruited in this city on a scheduled basis.</p>

<p>▲ Yang Peiwen's Resignation Approved</p>
<p>▲ Bureau Committee Member Chen Songchun Appointed as Successor</p>
<p>Since Yang Peiwen took over as the director of the Shanghai Municipal Public Education Center last year, he has made every effort in planning and managing it.

Now, due to personal reasons, Mr. Yang has submitted his resignation to the Municipal Education Bureau, which has been approved. Chen Songchun, the chief clerk of the fourth section of the bureau, has been appointed as his successor.

<h3>The Customs Specialization School's Foreign Affairs Class Will Enroll Students</h3>
<p>The Second Branch of the Customs Specialization School is located in Shanghai, specializing in cultivating talents for foreign affairs within customs. Since the customs tariff autonomy, the tax regulations have been revised, and the rates are now higher than before. Some people with a greedy desire for profit have been evading taxes and smuggling. Therefore, the customs needs more personnel for foreign affairs. Graduates of the school in previous years have all been assigned to various customs offices. It is recently learned that the school, in order to train advanced foreign affairs talents, has increased the difficulty of the coursework and changed the graduation period to two years. This summer, it will enroll 60 new students.</p>
<h3>"Guidance for Entrance Exams" is a Must-Read for Preparing for the Joint Entrance Exam</h3>
<p>▲ Praised and Introduced by Cai Yuanpei</p>
<p>It is now early summer, and the joint entrance examination is not far off. The strictness of the joint entrance examination is well known. It would be a great pity if one were to fail the examination and all efforts were to be wasted. Therefore, students have been writing to purchase and read Guidance for Entrance Exams to prepare for the joint entrance examination. However, the most detailed and practical guidance for entrance exams is found in the "University Entrance Exam Guidance" and "Middle School Entrance Exam Guidance" published by the Diligence Bookstore on Labor Father Road in the French Concession of this city. Mr. Cai Yuanpei, a prominent figure, specially wrote an introduction: "...If examinees are not genuinely unqualified but fail simply because they are unfamiliar with the content and procedures, it would be a great injustice. Mr. Lu has compiled these two books, Guidance for University and Middle School Entrance Exams, to address this difficulty. Their thorough collection of information and clear descriptions make them a worthy guide for those aspiring to higher education. I am writing a few words to introduce them." These two books are the result of careful work and experience by Mr. Lu Shaoji, a well-known educator and director of the Normal Department of the Shanghai Provincial Middle School. The content is rich and detailed, covering the preparation before the exam, points to note during the exam, procedures after admission, and the regulations of middle schools and universities nationwide. The theory is detailed and the guidance is practical. They are truly must-reads for both the joint entrance examination and entrance to higher education. The printing is excellent, and the binding is beautiful. The price for each book is 60 cents, plus 11 cents for registered postage. They are also available at the bookstore's retail department at No. 554, Fourth Avenue.</p>

<h3>Due to German Anti-Semitism, the Next Olympics May Not Be Held in Germany</h3>
<p>丨Opinion Expressed by the President of the US Olympic Committee丨</p>
<p>World Games should not be held in countries that discriminate against other races. The International Olympic Committee will discuss this at its Vienna meeting this summer.</p>
<p>(Baltimore, USA) Mr. Brent Tuthaker, the president of the US Olympic Committee, recently sent a letter to Mr. Miller, the editor of the Baltimore Jewish Daily, expressing his personal views on the German anti-Semitism. Burt believes that the World Olympic Games should not be held in a country that conflicts with the fundamental principle of national equality of the Olympic Games. The next World Olympic Games in 1936 has already been approved to be held in Berlin. Burt's letter states as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the letter concerning Germany's ban on Jews participating in the World Games and the steps it has already taken, the reply is as follows: The direct handling and refereeing rights of the World Olympic Games are in the hands of the World Olympic Committee. The meeting will be held in Vienna this summer, and this matter will undoubtedly be raised at the conference. My personal opinion is that the World Games should not be held in a country that conflicts with the fundamental principle of national equality of the World Games. The mutual agreements of the Olympic Games are not limited by class, color, or race. The US Olympic Committee will discuss this matter first.</p>

<h3>General Overview of Education in European Countries (1)</h3>
<p>— Recorded by Lu Bingqian</p>
<p>丨Speech by Cheng Qibao at the Municipal Education Bureau丨</p>
<p>The topic I will be discussing today can be roughly divided into four parts: (1) the process of this observation, (2) the general situation of education in various countries, (3) the trends of education in Europe, and (4) the problems of education in China.</p>
<p>1.  The Process of Observation</p>
<p>The time for our observation this time was very short. In actual calculation, it was only about six months. We passed through almost nine countries, spending an average of only about two weeks in each country. With such a short time, it was naturally impossible to make thorough inquiries and investigations. What we saw were just some incomplete impressions. Therefore, the expectations of the general public for us were originally very high, thinking that after this observation, we would definitely make a great contribution and be able to prescribe a remedy for China's education to cure the chronic diseases of the past twenty years. However, the fact is that we inevitably failed their expectations. This point, before I start speaking, should be explained to you first. In the future, we still hope that everyone will be guided by the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation to open up a brand new path for Chinese education.</p>
<p>I remember from the year before last to the first month of last year, European countries had a Chinese education observation group come to China. Among them, one was the German Minister of Education, one was a French scientist, and one was a British scientist and economist. They came to China to observe education for a very short time and traveled very little, only visiting Hangzhou, Shanghai, Tianjin, and Nanjing. Recently, they have a report that, although very detailed, they also feel that their observation situation cannot be thoroughly understood and have requested the Chinese government to send a few people to Europe to exchange actual situations with each other. At that time, the Chinese government very much approved of this proposal, so it sent five people to Europe to observe for eight months. During these eight months, the various countries they visited were very friendly to us. Whenever they went to a place, they would receive a warm reception and welcome. We feel that China's foreign friendship is not bad. They were able to express sympathy and thorough understanding for our observation this time. Therefore, our trip was not only shouldering our mission but also increased a lot of international friendship. There is also one thing that we feel very ashamed about, that is, many places in European countries do not understand the situation in China. The big places are still okay, but when they arrive in small places, they are just like us when we see foreigners, finding it very strange to see us shaking hands and talking with them. This is really due to China's lack of propaganda abroad. Japan is not like that. For example, in the Sino-Japanese problem, Japan desperately promotes itself abroad, even buying many newspapers. Many newspapers in Poland are bought by Japan. Chinese diplomacy lacks this kind of courage, so it feels a lot of difficulties. They are not unwilling to provide assistance to China, but unfortunately, they do not understand the situation in China very well. Although this issue is small, we should also pay attention to it.</p>
<p>2.  The Educational Situation in Various Countries</p>
<p>Because the impressions gained from six months of observation are very complex, it is not easy to sort them out clearly. Today, I can only give a summary report. If there is a chance in the future, I will discuss them separately.</p>
<p>European countries have all undergone extremely great changes in education in the fifteen years after the war. They have suffered from the wounds of the war and feel the need to reform the educational system and methods. This reform can be seen from two aspects in general. On the one hand, because of the revival of modern nations, to make their own nations continue to flourish, naturally, they rely on the power of education. The past war did not know how many human lives and properties were lost. Although there are many main reasons, the error of the educational methods is also one of them. The obvious errors are roughly three points: (1) The past education was too nationalistic. The knowledge and methods of education were all focused on maintaining the survival of the state. Therefore, an uncongenial phenomenon was created between countries. Everywhere, their own country was regarded as important, and international conflicts arose. (2) The past education was too materialistic. The result of education was that everyone only sought profit, only sought material satisfaction, and did not ask about spiritual comfort, so that personal life could not be equalized, and social conflicts also arose. (3) The past education was too intellectualized, regarding schools as places for seeking knowledge and not seeking personal life adaptation. With these three points, the unprecedented European War was indirectly brewed. Now, to build a new nation, they should build their own nation on the foundation of reason and adapt culture to the needs of the nation. On the one hand, they advocate education of geniuses, hoping that everyone can use their talents to discover new creations, and then integrate them with the old culture to create a new culture. This kind of change is from a general perspective. The degree and methods of educational change in the eight countries observed this time are also different. They can be roughly divided into four categories: (1) England and France, in fact, the degree of their change is very shallow. (2) Emerging countries, after the war, based on the spirit of national self-determination, established many small countries, such as Poland and Czechoslovakia. They did not have an educational system in the past. After establishing the country, they had to start from scratch, create a new educational system, and establish a new educational system. There are many materials in the middle that can be used for our reference. (3) Germany and Austria, after the war, their political systems changed, and their educational systems and methods also changed. (4) The most noteworthy and interesting are Russia and Italy. These two countries are absolutely different in political system and seem to be unable to come together. In fact, Russia practices a communist political system, and political power is in the hands of the proletariat. Italy is also a one-party dictatorship. It regards education as a tool of politics, and the strength of education is relied upon to implement political propositions. Their situation is the same as China's and is worthy of our special attention. The following will be explained separately.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Being Deflated</h3>
<p>— Zhanlu</p>
<p>The two words "being deflated" are a kind of slang popular in Suzhou and Shanghai, the meaning of which seems to have the meaning of knocking people down; but knocking down is done with the hand, and being deflated is done with the mouth, and the effect of the mouth is even more ferocious than the effect of the hand. Therefore, people who are knocked down sometimes fall quickly, and climb up even faster; and people who are deflated, if they want to return to their original state, and be as full of muscles and plump of skin as before, then this should respond to a sentence by Mr. Dongfang: "How easy is it to talk about?"</p>
<p>Let me give two examples: A person who is knocked down is only beaten with a stuffy stick; if the constitution is weak and cannot withstand this major blow, then he will be depressed, and never recover again. If not, jumping up from the ground, snatching the other person's stuffy stick, "treating the other person in the way they treated you," then the person who was knocked down can also knock down the other person to vent this anger. As for the person who is deflated, then there is very little hope! The fat and flesh have been sucked away by people, leaving only the empty skin of a "flat collapsed candle," but he still wants to eat a reassuring pill, thinking that he can definitely be as full of muscles and plump of skin as before; hey! Go read a "Classic of Difficulties"! I'm afraid it's a thousand times difficult, more difficult than anything else.</p>
<p>China is a crystal clear and plump honey peach; if the gluttonous enemy keeps sucking it, then it is naturally in a position of being deflated. But, not all countries in the world are honey peaches that are easily deflated. Why is Germany paying very close attention to the Pacific islands, but now doesn't want to take them back? Dare to ask, is Germany being deflated by the Orientals? Why is the Soviet Union, which is unwilling to give in on the Middle East Railway, now willing to sell it to its enemies? Dare to ask, is Russia being deflated by the Orientals? Although that is the case, Germany and Russia being deflated by the Orientals still retain their faces; Germany is only half deflated, and Russia is only quasi-deflated, only our old empire, transformed into a young Republic of China, is completely deflated! Half-deflated is Deflated Big, quasi-deflated is Deflated Two, and completely deflated is actually a Deflated Three! Recently, Deflated Two sold the Middle East Railway, and our government protested to the Soviet Union; as a result, we were rebuffed, and fell into a criticism of "losing moral rights." Alas! Deflated Two is dealing with Deflated Big, of course, it doesn't dare to do anything, but now the one protesting is not Deflated Big, but Deflated Three; then, the quasi-deflated Deflated Two is going to deflate the completely deflated Deflated Three again!</p>
<p>According to the appetite of the Orientals, they almost want to deflate the countries of the whole world before they can be happy; but, can a dwarf's stomach really swallow such a big Earth? After swallowing it, will a volcanic eruption not occur in his belly? This is a question.</p>
<h3>Refugee</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Because domestic politics are not on the right track, social organizations are imperfect, and it is very difficult for the unemployed to find work. Even with work, it is difficult to maintain a living. Therefore, compatriots who sell their sweat and blood try every possible means to sneak abroad. Although all the power of life and death is in the hands of foreigners, and they have to live an inhuman life, fortunately, patience and hard work are the characteristics of the Chinese. Therefore, under their hard work, they can stand firm, and many people indeed make a fortune. They are perched above the various classes of people in the country and are called overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>They can use methods to get money from foreigners and can also contribute money back to the country to subsidize the funds needed for various new national salvation terms. From China's point of view, of course, this is the best thing. However, in the eyes of foreigners, they really cannot stand it. Their own country is experiencing an economic downturn, and there are many unemployed people. If they were to let the Chinese, whom they consider as despicable as dogs, steal their jobs, it would be a case of "leading beasts to eat people, how can they be parents of the people?" Therefore, the "parents" of the general foreigners, for the sake of their people, no country, whether it is a large country, a small country, a strong country, or a weak country, is not desperately driving away overseas Chinese. As for the methods of driving them away, they can be roughly divided into two types: artistic and inartistic. Japan's method of driving away overseas Chinese is burning, looting, and killing, which is the most inartistic method. The Philippines, Siam, the United States, and Mexico are much more artistic. They first use various heavy taxes to make it impossible for overseas Chinese to gain a foothold and have to leave. If they still cannot be driven away, the methods of burning, looting, and killing may be imitated. Now, the overseas Chinese in Mexico already feel that it is impossible to stay, and they are fleeing back to their motherland in batches in a very embarrassed manner. These are the "refugees" mentioned in this article, a term as novel as "disaster officials."</p>
<p>In fact, since we are born in this 20th century full of murderous intent, and unfortunately dispatched by God to China full of death, we can only be optimistic and live day by day. Moreover, the political instability, imperfect social organization, and the inability to settle unemployed people, which are generally worried about, are only temporary problems. As long as you take "immortality pills" to prolong your life and wait, even if you cannot get your wish in your lifetime, you must make a will, ordering your sons, grandsons, great-grandsons, great-great-grandsons,... rather wait quietly for God's will to die than presumptuously try to survive by human plans. Don't worry, there will be a day when you will see a prosperous scene. There is really no need to travel across the ocean to suffer the dirty air of foreigners. If you insist on going against the will of heaven, then no one will be responsible for all the misfortunes that come, and no one will dare to ask about it. It is truly pitiful to have suffering that cannot be spoken and grievances that cannot be expressed!</p>
<h3>Tribulus</h3>
<p>— Sha Yu</p>
<p>Prostitutes can revitalize the market; special goods can broaden tax revenue; gambling dens can support vagrants; who says that smoking, gambling, and prostitution have no benefits! Only when Japanese planes flew to scout Beiping did we realize that it was foresighted of the important people to move the antiques south.</p>
<p>Women are particularly sensitive to the heat of the weather. In this warm early summer, modern girls showing off their jade legs can be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>The girls who peddle snacks in hotels and tea houses are even learning from the flower girls in hotels, hawking things to diners, which shows that making a living is not easy.</p>
<p>People who live nightlife in the city will never feel the passage of time in the phrase "falling flowers, flowing water, and spring is gone."</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>Northeast Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 6: Sweet and Bitter Love Field, Coldly Observing and Commenting on Two Sides, Rugged World, Secret Agreement for Three Years</p>
<p>Ji Zhi smiled. He raised his shoulders a couple of times and said: You are just saying that casually, without sincerity. Are you promising to come tomorrow, or are you promising to come the day after tomorrow? And... Gui Zhi said with a straight face: After all, it's just these words, what am I coming for? Ji Zhi said; I have to ask you again, why did you promise the two words? Gui Zhi couldn't help but chuckle and said: You don't need to ask, we are just making do now. Whenever you tell us to come, we will come. We dare not be late, huh? Saying that, she smiled again. Seeing this, Ji Zhi knew that he could not keep her here, so he had to put down his hand and nodded, saying: You are too kind, you are too kind. It will be at this time tomorrow that we will meet here, rain or shine. Gui Zhi said with a faint smile: Alright. Ji Zhi smiled: No, no, you are promising so casually, how would I know if you will come? Gui Zhi said: Then, how should I promise? Ji Zhi said: You have to say that's how it will be done. Gui Zhi nodded slightly and said: Oh! That's how it will be done. The last word of that sentence was dragged out extremely long. Ji Zhi said: You see, you always promise me so casually. But I know, you are joking with me, you will come tomorrow. Gui Zhi didn't say anything more to him, she pulled him away and stepped out of the door of the private room. In order to make the appointment for tomorrow more concrete, Ji Zhi followed her behind, all the way to the door. Gui Zhi turned around and said: Don't see me off, I don't want you to see me off. Ji Zhi smiled: If you don't want me to see you off, I won't, but... Gui Zhi smiled: I won't come tomorrow, you just wait. Saying that, she twisted her body and left. Ji Zhi felt that her attitude was very lively at this time, and naturally he was very happy in his heart. She said she wouldn't come tomorrow, that's exactly when she would come, he would wait for her early tomorrow. Ji Zhi thought like this, and happily walked back into the private room to clear the bill for the refreshments. Before he had even stepped into the door, he heard someone in the private room next door call out Ji Zhi. He recognized the voice immediately, it was his elder brother, Hou Zhi. This was strange, when did he come? He must have heard everything I just said to Gui Zhi. Involuntarily, his heart began to pound. While he was hesitating, the second call of Ji Zhi came out, which really made it difficult for him. However, how could he escape? He had to bite the bullet and walk to the private room next door.

<h3>Cigarettes</h3>
<p>— A Jie</p>
<p>The only consolation for those of us who live a monotonous life outside is "cigarettes." Liu Ling used wine as a consolation, and Lu Tong used tea as a consolation. How could they know that besides tea and wine, there are also cigarettes? Drinking too much wine can lead to insanity; drinking too much tea is also tasteless. Only this paper-rolled cigarette is a wonderful thing to relieve worries and leave behind joy. Kissing it from time to time, it is more lovely than a beautiful woman.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman is something to be admired but not to be trifled with, just like a flower. However, some like the rich and beautiful flowers like peonies and芍藥, while others like the pure and beautiful flowers like plums, chrysanthemums, and芙蓉; some like the gorgeous flowers like蔴蕪, red bananas, peaches, and plums; some like the淡沱 flowers like水葓, osmanthus, and morning glory. This is because everyone has different views. Only cigarettes are not for appreciation but for playing with, just like every family has a housewife, and everyone wants to embrace a yellow-faced woman. This is a phenomenon in our noble country at the moment!</p>
<p>When there is something to do, smoking a cigarette can refresh you; when there is nothing to do, smoking a cigarette can relieve boredom; after meals and after drinking, cigarettes are especially essential. If you, old man, have made up your mind to use your sword of wisdom to cut off the threads of love, you will always fail. Therefore, the name of cigarettes is "love grass," which shows its magic.</p>
<p>Cigarettes can also enhance the love between husband and wife. Occasionally, when your wife is angry, gentle consideration and sweet words cannot work. As long as you, old man, respectfully offer a cigarette, light a match, and bring it to your wife's cherry lips, naturally she will smile sweetly and a hundred charms will be born, which can fill the sea of hatred, can fill the sky of love, and you will feel unexpected effects, avoiding the skit of Chen Jichang dressing up and kneeling in the pond. According to this geometric theorem, if applied to adults and gentlemen, it will definitely have the same unexpected effect. Therefore, cigarettes can also be called "magic wands." I have never dared to admit the saying that cigarettes are harmful.</p>
<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3>Soft-Shelled Turtle and Crucian Carp</h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>Soft-shelled turtle, also known as 鱉, is best with a blue-white abdomen, produced in inland rivers. It is a beneficial food in spring. It is most fresh when rapeseed flowers are yellow and peonies are blooming. Therefore, it is called "rapeseed flower soft-shelled turtle" and "peony soft-shelled turtle." The best way to eat it is stewed clearly. However, it must be washed and scraped clean. First, add water and boil it slightly until it boils, then remove the water and place it in a jar. Add southern ham, bamboo shoots, winter mushrooms, diced pork fat, rock sugar, Chen wine, and a little salt and ginger. Cover tightly and simmer over low heat until tender. It is very clear, fat, and delicious. If you add two or three red dates to cook together, it can remove the fishy taste. In addition, in Cantonese cuisine, soft-shelled turtle and black chicken feet are cooked together, named Phoenix Claw Water Fish, which also has a special flavor. However, it seems unsuitable to eat in summer. It is said that soft-shelled turtles are poisonous if they are sucked by mosquitoes, and are called "mosquito soft-shelled turtles." Only when "osmanthus soft-shelled turtles" are on the market in August and September can you gorge yourself. In addition, crucian carp lacks freshness in summer. According to fishermen, after the Beginning of Summer, water rats can transform into crucian carp, so it is also advisable not to eat them.</p>
<h3>Wisteria Flower Cake</h3>
<p>— Yi Qiu</p>
<p>When the wisteria flowers bloom in spring and summer in villages or courtyards (commonly known as 藤簍花 in the north), the villagers say that there are both male and female flowers. The color is purple, but the male ones are more gorgeous and have no fragrance, only for passers-by to appreciate. The female ones are light in color and fragrant, and can be used to make cakes, which are extremely delicious. When my father was alive, he loved them the most. Now, when the wisteria flowers are in full bloom, I will describe the method below for greedy comrades. Pick dozens of female flowers, remove the calyxes, and wash the petals in clean water. Use four taels of flour, two eggs, and two taels of white sugar (those who like sweets can add a little). Mix with half a bowl of clean water, then mix the washed petals into the mixture, pour it into a flat-bottomed oiled pan, and fry for about two or three minutes. The method is extremely simple, and it is fragrant and long-lasting. It has a unique flavor to eat. It is especially valuable to entertain guests with it. All my greedy comrades, why not try it? (According to the experiment, eating this flower is harmless and beneficial to digestion.)</p>
<h3>Changzhou Food</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Steamed buns: Nanxiang steamed buns have always been famous at sea, but I don't think they are good. At first, I thought that oranges would turn into trifoliate oranges when they crossed the Huai River. On a Sunday holiday, I rushed to Nanxiang to try them, but they were not that great. Because I am used to eating our Changzhou steamed buns, I feel that all the steamed buns in the world are tasteless. (Too exaggerated, right?) Our Changzhou steamed buns are similar in style to Nanxiang, but slightly smaller. However, the skin is thinner, and the meat filling inside is firm like a ball, not divided or scattered. There is a lot of juice outside the filling and inside the skin. The goodness of Changzhou steamed buns lies in their thin skin and juicy filling. When eating, you must first bite through the skin and suck up the juice. If you don't understand this trick, you will burn your lips and tongue with the juice, or splash it all over the table, or stain your clothes. Also, when eating, add ginger and vinegar, and you will really feel that the taste is endless. All the major tea houses in Changzhou also sell snacks, wine, and dishes. The steamed bun business is the biggest in the morning. There are two types of steamed buns, one is ordinary, as mentioned above, and the other is like crab, which can only be eaten in the autumn wind. The former sells for two copper coins each, and the latter sells for three coins, which is really a good snack that is cheap and good. Now these steamed buns have come to Shanghai. The store name is Dafeng and it is located next to the Tianchan Stage on Yunnan Road. It is run by people from Changzhou. All the chefs and waiters are also from Changzhou, so the style and taste of the steamed buns here are exactly the same as in Changzhou. Foodies may wish to try it to verify what I said. However, the price is more expensive than in Changzhou. The ordinary one sells for two cents of foreign money, and the crab one costs five cents. This is because all the expenses at sea are much higher than in Changzhou, so it has to be. But after you eat it, you will still say that it is good value for money. The second is rice wine. The rice wine dumpling shops in Shanghai must add the words Changzhou to their signs, which shows that Changzhou rice wine is very famous. However, in our Changzhou area, there is no one who praises rice wine. Changzhou also does not see any shops that specialize in selling rice wine dumplings. Although small hotels also sell rice wine as an accompaniment, only women and children who cannot drink occasionally go to buy some to eat and play. Changzhou is not known for its rice wine, but rice wine shops at sea must add the words Changzhou, which really makes me wonder. The third is sesame cake: Shanghai's flatbread is like our Changzhou sesame cake. Some people in Shanghai disdain to mention flatbread, but people who eat Changzhou sesame cake will praise it endlessly. This sesame cake is made in the same way as flatbread, but it is incredibly crispy and melts in your mouth like chewing on a cake. The sweet ones are filled with lard and white sugar, and the salty ones are made with lard and salt. Eating one in the morning is enough to fill your stomach. Many large tea houses have them and sell them as snacks with steamed buns. Deng Zhao, the former president of Suzhou Advanced Industrial School, who studied abroad, ate it once in Chang and praised the beauty of Changzhou sesame cake whenever he met someone, which shows that what I said is true. However, it must be eaten as soon as it is made, and it is tasteless when cold, so it must be made to order and there is no ready-made one for sale.</p>

<h3>Financial Silver Plummets, Gold Price Almost Reaches 1,000 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>(Foreign Exchange Extremely Tight, Covering Shorts and Going Long Fight Together)</p>
<p>The gold market soared again yesterday, almost reaching the 1,000 yuan mark. The morning market was extremely firm, and the afternoon was relatively weak. Demand exceeded supply. In the early morning, due to the continued sharp decline in overseas silver markets, the gross price rose immediately (plus the swap rate). Later, large accounts covering shorts and going long fought together, and the exchange market gradually tightened, once rising to 999 yuan. Later, the exchange market was relatively loose, and there was a rumor that France was planning to abandon the gold standard, which led to weak sentiment. Citibank and the Bank of Japan dumped heavily, and it retreated to 990 yuan. In the early afternoon, buying was still strong and stable, but it fell due to the hardening of the domestic market. Although Mumbai reported declines twice, the closing price still fell to within 990 yuan. During the day, large accounts such as Fuyu, Changsheng, Yongqingfa, Yongdaxing, Yongheng, Yu, etc. had a very strong desire to buy. Although there were many rumors, they could not be confirmed and had little impact. The pure gold price was calculated to increase by 60 yuan, and the swap discount for May-June was from 20 yuan to 21 yuan, May-July was 34.5 yuan, and June-July was from 11-12 yuan to 17-18 yuan.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 983.5 yuan, and the physical opening was 4.6 yuan. The exchange market opened with both British and American currencies tight. The recent selling price of British exchange was 1 shilling and 2.5 pence, and the US exchange was 23.875 yuan. Fuchang, Hongli, Fuyu, Chunyuan, Yong, etc. came up with offers, and it reached 8 yuan in one fell swoop. Mitsui sold US dollars for May to Huabi at 9.375 yuan, Tongyi sold on the market, Yuanheng sold heavily, and Mitsubishi also came out. Huabi's June US dollars could be settled at 24 yuan, and August US dollars could be settled at 3.125 yuan, and it fell to 3 yuan. HSBC ate August at half a yuan, so it sold human rights, Zhaofengchang came up with offers and stabilized, and soon August 3.125 yuan was difficult to settle. Changsheng, Yongqingfa, and Yong all bought, and it rose to 9.2 yuan. The exchange market was released by Mitsui for August at 25, and Hefeng sold it to Daxingyong at the same price in the same month. Yongfeng and Daxingyong came up to hedge futures, and it retreated to within 7 yuan. HSBC Bank quoted a small 25 for British currency and a small half yuan for US currency. The announcement was still hovering, and later Huabi came out with August at 25, Hefeng sold July at 125, Yongfeng sold heavily again and again, Fuchang also sold, and it retreated to within 6 yuan. Zhihui, Yongrun, and Changyu also sold, and it fell to 5 yuan. Huabi ate US dollars for August at 3.125 and stabilized. Zhaofengchang and Fuchang then made slight advances, and retail investors also raised prices, gradually pulling up. US dollars for June at 8.75 were difficult to settle, and Qianchangxiang and Fuyu bought heavily, and it rose to 91 yuan. Physical goods were released and fell slightly, but because US dollars for July at 0.625 were difficult to settle, Fuyu bought heavily, and Hengyu also advanced, rising to 93 yuan. Foreign bank companies ate US dollars for August at 125, and Daxingyong advanced fiercely, reaching beyond 4 yuan. Afterwards, US dollars for August at 125, the silver company still wanted US dollars for July at 24, which was difficult to settle. Qingfayong, Daxingyong, Hengyu, Tianfengyong, etc. all advanced, and it rose to beyond 7 yuan. US dollars for June at 75 and US dollars for July at 8.75 were difficult to settle one after another, and Fuyu came to file an offer again, and it jumped to 99 yuan. Fuchang sold off at 5.2 yuan, and Huabi ate August at 24 yuan, which was slightly stable. Later, the sentiment changed, Sumitomo released June at 75, Citibank also released the same month at 8.125, Fuchang released continuously, and Daxingyong turned around and sold off. The closing price was 990 yuan, and the physical price was 91 yuan.</p>
<p>The opening price of the after-market was 992 yuan, and the physical opening price was 1.5 yuan. This was because Daxingyong bought in immediately at the quoted price outside the market, and retail investors raised the opening price to a large extent to take profits and retreat to 1 yuan. Daxingyong, Fuchang, and Yuanheng all filed offers, and it gradually rose to 8.5 yuan. Shanghai Huabi was doing US dollars for June at 8.125 as well. Huabi came out with August at 24 yuan, and Fuyu and Wanxing all sold. Although Bingxing advanced, it was still downstream. Before long, Mackley sold US dollars for August at 0.625 to Youli, and Dadecheng, Chunyuan, and Yongshunli all sold, retreating to 2 yuan. There was a slight rebound because Mumbai was a small ten annas as well. North Korea released June at 8.125 continuously, and Fuyu, Yuansheng, and Yong all sold, retreating to 89 yuan. HSBC ate June at 8.75, which was released by Xinyi, and gradually pulled up. Hengyu, Yifengyong, etc. advanced to 92 yuan. The Dalian gang released Huabi at 24 yuan for July and 75 yuan for May.

Mumbai fell another rupee, and the closing price returned to 988.5 yuan, and the physical price was 9 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the day was 999 yuan, and the lowest price was 983 yuan, with a difference of 16 yuan. As a result, the closing price was higher than the previous closing price (plus the swap rate difference of 12 yuan) by about 18.8 yuan in total.</p>
<p>Because HSBC Bank's US exchange quoted a decline of half a yuan, it was calculated that the alloy price of 23.5 yuan was 1,021 yuan and zero. According to the closing price, about 32.78 yuan was pressed down, which was more than 14 yuan stronger than the previous closing. The registered account for this month was 1,022 yuan, 1,002 yuan for June, and 990 yuan for July. The replenishment in the morning was 1,022 yuan, and 1,021 yuan in the afternoon.

<p>Swap (May-June) Yingfenghheng discounted 84 offers to Hengxing, totaling 20 yuan, Yuanmaoyong discounted 112 offers to Qianchangxiang, for 21 yuan, and Zhifenghheng discounted 7 offers to Qianchangxiang, at the same price.

The opening price was 13-14 yuan, and the Dalian gang discounted. Later, Cuitai, Runchangyu discounted 12 yuan, and finally about 13 yuan inside and outside, the turnover was light. There were still 2,996 offers left for this month, and 8,687 offers for June.</p>
<p>The transaction in the market was relatively active, and large accounts were eager for offers, and the replenishment continued. In summary, Fuyu, Changsheng, Yongqingfa, Yong, Zhaofengchang, Daxingyong, Tianfengyong, Wanxing, Bingxing, Ruixing, etc. all advanced. Yongfeng, Yuanheng, Fuchang, Shunli, Chunyuan, Yong, Tongyi, Runchangyu, Zhifenghheng, etc. all came out.

The foreign exchange interest rate in the morning and afternoon was uniformly six points, slightly better than the previous day by two points, and the situation seemed to be fluctuating.

<h3>Sharp Drop in Jiangnan Small Coins, Continued Rise in Copper Coins</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price of Jiangnan small silver coins suddenly plummeted in the morning and afternoon sessions, reaching only 845 yuan, a drop of 15 yuan compared to the morning price of the previous day. There was no trading activity in both sessions. This was because this type of cash is not widely used in the market, so it did not significantly affect the market. The price of Guangdong small silver coins was 780 yuan and 30 cents in the morning session, a decrease of 1 yuan and 20 cents compared to the afternoon session of the previous day.

<p>Securities</p>
<h3>"New Measures" Fuel Bond Market Surge</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange, the market atmosphere was extremely tense. Amid the highly critical situation in Tianjin and Beijing, the bond market suddenly experienced a rapid rise. The northern syndicate was aggressively buying to cover short positions, while those with floating short positions felt particularly panicked and followed the trend, groping forward in the dark. Although it was reported that areas such as Miyun and Tangshan had been abandoned and the threat to Tianjin and Beijing was imminent, it was also said that Huang Fu had entered Beijing to implement so-called new measures for the situation in North China. As a result, market prices advanced rapidly with a strong upward trend. The opening price in the morning session rose by 70 to 80 cents. At that time, it was rumored in the market that the Japanese had declared the Great Wall as the boundary and would not invade Tianjin and Beijing, so there was hope that Tianjin and Beijing would be spared. The northern syndicate was most aggressive in covering short positions, and the second session rose by another 50 to 60 cents. In the afternoon, rumors of the so-called new measures became widespread, and investor sentiment became more bullish. The opening price rose by another 60 to 70 cents. The strength of the upward trend and the favorable situation were unprecedented. At the close, some temporary bulls cashed out, resulting in a pullback, with prices falling by as much as 60 to 70 cents. However, some types of bonds still rose by 10 to 20 cents. The sudden arrival of such important news as the settlement date approached made the surge even more powerful. As a result, market prices rose across the board, ranging from 60 cents to 1.7 yuan. The total trading volume was 15,777,000 yuan, including 20,000 yuan in cash, 6,910,000 yuan in futures for salt and tobacco tax, 2,385,000 yuan in futures for demobilization bonds, 2,310,000 yuan in futures for the 1929 Lan-Shan bonds, and 3,295,000 yuan in futures for the 1920 customs bonds. The remaining amounts ranged from tens of thousands to 850,000 yuan.</p>
<h3>New York "Wet" Stocks Rise Amidst General Decline</h3>
<p>According to a report from New-Fung Foreign Firm, on Monday (the 15th), the New York stock market saw "wet" stocks, those related to alcoholic beverages, rise by $2 to $8 due to continued easing of restrictions on medicinal alcohol. Other stocks saw minimal changes, with speculation and caution prevailing due to concerns that German Chancellor Hitler's speech would disrupt the World Economic Conference. The total daily trading volume was 3.15 million shares. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 79.70 Down 1.15</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 36.39 Down 0.49</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks 27.70 Down 0.20</p>
<p>40 Bonds 80.99 Down 0.01</p>
<h3>Lower American Cotton Prices Pressure Yarn and Cotton Market</h3>
<p>The yarn market has weakened again due to the continuous decline in American cotton prices, which has softened investor sentiment. However, major buyers are still purchasing "Jia Ma" grade yarn, while retail investors are lukewarm. The market is trending downward again. While the market for locally produced yarn is gradually developing in the South China region, demand from other areas remains sluggish. Rumors are rampant in the market, claiming that factories are uniting to push prices up. However, the current critical situation and economic hardship are hindering the yarn market's upward momentum.</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Prices Fall More Than One Yuan</h3>
<p>The opening price of raw cotton futures contracts for the near months of delivery (May, June, July) in the previous session fell by 6, 7, 8, and 9 cents, respectively, due to the weak performance of foreign cotton and a lack of buyers in the market. In the afternoon, news of good real demand emerged, but investor sentiment remained flat. The closing price for all months trended downward, with concerns that American cotton prices would fall further. The price for all months fell by 4, 5, 6, 7, and 9 cents, respectively. The total trading volume for the day was 53,700 bales. Sales included 1,250 bales from Zhen Da, 2,100 bales from Chong An, 1,500 bales from Tong He, 2,100 bales from De Ji, and 1,000 bales from Chun Ji. Purchases included 2,150 bales from Ren Fung, 1,650 bales from Yi Chang, 1,850 bales from Chang Fung, 1,100 bales from Yong Chang, and 850 bales from Rui Da. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Open Interest: August 1934 Down 13, 51,700</p>
<p>May 1872 Down 19, 24,300 September 1946 Down 12, 40,850</p>
<p>June 1889 Down 15, 38,650 October 1955 Down 11, 24,150</p>
<p>July 1906 Down 13, 52,850 Total 232,250</p>
<h3>South China Purchases Most Actively</h3>
<p>The consumption of existing yarn remains brisk, with particularly strong demand from the South. The total purchases from various regions for the entire day are estimated at 2,195 bales, with prices rising by 50 cents. The purchase amounts from each region are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 1,512 Changsha 200 Jiangxi 20</p>
<p>Luzhou 60 Shantou 50 Inland 210</p>
<p>Ningbo 13 Peers 25 Sichuan 100</p>
<p>The cotton market is declining due to the fall in American cotton prices and even smaller declines in Indian cotton prices, which has dampened investor sentiment, leading to the liquidation of long positions. However, major buyers remain bullish and are actively increasing their purchases, keeping the market tight. The current situation is difficult to predict, and the future depends on American cotton prices.</p>
<h3>Zheng Cotton Falls</h3>
<p>Zheng cotton opened lower in the previous session, following the decline in foreign cotton prices, and investor sentiment was flat. Prices for all months fell by 40 to 45 cents. In the afternoon, prices for all months fell again by 50 cents to 150 cents. The total trading volume for the day was 95,200 dan. Sales included 4,700 dan from Heng Yi, 3,100 dan from Sui Long, 2,100 dan from Da Chang Cheng, 1,500 dan from Xie Sheng, and 1,700 dan from Da Fu. Purchases included 8,100 dan from Yuan Da, 3,800 dan from Yi Chang, 2,000 dan from Yong Chang, 5,600 dan from Chang He, and 2,600 dan from Yi Fung. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Cotton Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, and Open Interest: August 45.40 Up 6, 142,000</p>
<p>May 45.00 Down 5, 49,300 October 44.65 471,700</p>

<h3>General Long Positions Liquidated; American Cotton Falls</h3>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton initially fell due to rain in the drought-stricken areas, leading to the liquidation of long positions by the majority of traders. Later, prices firmed up as some short positions were covered. As a result, spot prices fell by 15 points, while futures prices fell by 14 to 20 points. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot prices fall by 20 points and futures prices fall by 19 to 20 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 20 points. The Bombay cotton market fell due to poor American cotton prices, selling by Japanese traders, and the liquidation of long positions. As a result, Pinggal fell by 3 rupees and 2.5 annas, Oomra fell by 8 rupees and 2.5 annas, and White Rock fell by 8 rupees. The original telegram is recorded below (dated May 15):</p>

<h3>Grain River Down Rice Prices Plummet, Losing Considerable Ground</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of goods was from numbers 30 to 40. The market situation remained sluggish, largely because the upcoming Dragon Boat Festival inevitably affected business, resulting in an even more depressed scene. Although the two wholesale houses varied somewhat, market prices ultimately saw a terrible decline. Although Su Tong's japonica and Nan Gang rice were seen, few customers were visiting the street, and only scattered orders were received. Therefore, sellers intended to tighten prices, but they failed to achieve their goals, as prices depreciated further. Thin rice was the same. Foreign firms, Beiping, and Weihaiwei were still interested in high-quality materials. Nanyang firms, Xinghua, and Fuzhou unanimously focused on this, while only a few firms in Zhongguan were active, handling only a few thousand bags. Moreover, their purchasing was strictly controlled, leading to a further decline in Qingjiao, Songjiang, Sifeng, and Xilian goods. Looking back at the top prices in recent months, compared to today, prices have fallen by a whole yuan. North Yangjian also saw prices decline due to sluggish demand, with prices falling by several tenths of a yuan. Fortunately, the situation changed, and the market price was not greatly affected.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, over a dozen firms from various routes along the river provided goods. The sales of white japonica rice were slow, with merchants picking shorter lengths, and the market price fell slightly by two tenths of a yuan. Thin japonica rice and early rice remained sluggish, with prices falling slightly by one or two tenths of a yuan. Although the arrival of Yang Du Jian was not strong, retail sales were sluggish, and the price fell slightly. The price for the changing yuan was weak, with a slight outflow, and the price was weak, falling more than a foot.</p>
<h3>Selling Spree Sweeps Flour and Wheat Market</h3>
<p>The flour market: After the opening bell in the morning, the price of all months declined unanimously. The quoted price for foreign wheat fell again by about two tenths of a yuan. The domestic situation became increasingly treacherous. The situation in the Tianjin and Beiping area became more chaotic by the day and seemed to be on the verge of collapse. Therefore, after the opening bell in the morning, Tianjin merchants continued to retreat step by step. Distant months also saw a decline because the new wheat harvest was approaching and a bumper harvest was expected. Both industry insiders and outsiders were unanimously selling, so the market atmosphere was weak. When the afternoon session opened, the situation in the north had become more serious. The real sales merchants adopted an extremely pessimistic attitude, which made the long positions deeply uneasy. Subsequent months also saw minor selling by large and small factories, and opening prices were also weak. Given this stable situation, if North sales were to make a decisive move, it would not be surprising for the current month to fall to 2.35 yuan. As a result, the price of the current month fell by two cents compared to the previous day, June fell by two cents and 2.5 mils, July fell by one cent and a half, August and September fell by one cent and 2.5 mils, and October fell by one cent.</p>
<p>The wheat market: The price of all months in both the morning and afternoon sessions continued to decline steadily. The current price decline was due to the imminent harvest of new wheat in the country. The factories, because of the new wheat season, still had a large amount of foreign wheat available for production and were not paying attention to the new wheat. In recent days, the situation in the north has been such that flour sales would inevitably be affected, and the wheat market became even more hopeless. Therefore, the selling pressure was extremely strong in both the morning and afternoon sessions, and prices fell frequently. As a result, the price of July fell by four cents compared to the previous day, August and September fell by five cents, and October fell by six cents.</p>
<h3>Foreign Rice and Xian Rice Sell Very Well</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Fuzhou merchants were very greedy and actively purchased Xianggan Rice and Xian Rice in the market. They also purchased small amounts of Foreign Rice, as well as newly arrived Xian Rice from Wuhu, Nanjing, and Jiangbei. The total transaction volume in the city was about 8,000 bags, which helped to support the declining market. The inventory in the market is still sufficient. In addition to Xian Rice from various routes, the inventory of Foreign Rice is even larger. Recently, the Shanghai market has been lively, and the supply is continuous. In addition to Xianggan, Du Jian Xian Rice from this province and various Xian Rice from Anhui have also arrived. The weather is hot, and local sales are weak. Stockpilers are planning to sell. Even merchants on this street intend to sell. Due to the hot weather, cargo owners are seeking to sell quickly, and the market is trending downward. Yesterday, the Min merchants were very greedy. In addition to Wenzhou merchants purchasing more than 200 bags of Hunan Ji Jing Rice, it was all purchased by the Min merchants. The local merchants did not purchase it and returned 1,500 bags of purchased Xiaojiao Rice to the Min merchants. The price of all rice was the same as the previous session, without any changes, it was said.</p>
<h3>News on Silk, Tea, and the Silkworm Season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>(Rugao) Also a silkworm breeding area in Jiangsu, farmers in Chahe, Dingyan, Juegang, Shuangdian, Youfangtou, Matang, Baipu, Libao, and other areas pay great attention to silkworm breeding. In recent years, due to unfavorable weather, silkworm cocoons have repeatedly failed, and the cost of silkworm breeding has been completely lost. The rural economy has collapsed. This year, silkworm farmers are borrowing money to breed silkworms. However, borrowing is difficult, and silkworm rearing is not smooth. Those who hatched local varieties early account for 40%, while those who breed foreign varieties later are more numerous. The weather is warm, and the silkworm larvae are developing smoothly. The early batches have already completed their third sleep and abandoned the leaves, while the second batch is entering their third sleep, and the late batches are only starting their second sleep. The current situation is very good.</p>
<p>(Changxing) Farmers, in light of the continuous poor harvests of silkworm cocoons, are considering economic depression. This year, silkworm farmers are facing financial difficulties and are borrowing money from the local township office to raise silkworms. Many farmers in Baifubu, Hongxingqiao, Niudianqiao, Xucangqiao, Heping, Lincheng, Xiayuanyuan, and Si'an are hatching improved varieties. The climate is warm, and the silkworm larvae hatch evenly and develop well. The early batches are about to enter their third sleep, while the second batch is abandoning the leaves after the second sleep, and the late batches are only in their second sleep. Mulberry leaf production is abundant, exceeding demand, and the price of leaves is only 30 to 40 cents per hundred catties. The other day, there was thunder and rain all night, but fortunately the silkworm larvae were still young and there was little impact.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Raw Silk Sales Are Still Not Quiet</h3>
<p>▲The price of white factory raw silk is small, and the cost is high… It is difficult to sell Jili raw silk due to a shortage.▲</p>
<p>Yesterday, in the local foreign firm silk market, the sales of Sichuan raw silk from Zhou factories were still not quiet. The cost of white factory raw silk was high, and the price was small, so the factories were waiting and watching. The inventory of Jili raw silk was thin, and transactions were difficult to facilitate. Yesterday, Xinfu imported 16 bales of Qinher brand at a price of 630 yuan, 6 bales of Flying Lion brand, and 4 bales of Flying Horse brand, all at a price of 640 yuan. In addition, there were 10 bales of Railway brand at a price of 670 yuan (the above are Sichuan factory raw silk, 13 to 15 articles). Yihua imported 20 bales of Shanghai white factory raw silk from 13 to 15 articles of the Neptune brand at a price of 725 yuan. Zhonghe imported 10 bales of Jinma brand Qili white dry raw silk at a price of 560 yuan. Xiangji imported 3 bales of Hong Maochang brand Bao Mian yellow silk, and Kechang also imported 1 bale, all at a price of 342.50 yuan.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Recent News from Wuyuan Tea</h3>
<p>(New Tea Estimated to Lose Money) The mountain farmers in the four villages of Wuyi County have been harvesting tea for weeks, but due to the cold weather, the tea buds are difficult to sprout and develop, and the daily output is small. In previous years, after six or seven days of harvesting and processing, at least half of the harvest was achieved. At the moment, the new tea produced by each household has not reached 40% of the total output. According to the tea farmers' estimates, this year's tea production will vary, with some being similar to last year, some being 70-80% as usual, and some even having a 50% shortfall. The reason is that the weather is not warm, and the tea leaves are tender and difficult to pick, so it is inevitable to lose money. In summary, the tea production in the whole county this year is mixed, and there is definitely a decrease compared to previous years.</p>
<p>(Mountain Farmers Secretly Complain) The poor farmers in this county have no land to cultivate themselves. All of their annual household expenses depend on the income from tea sales. This year's tea production is generally poor, and the cost of labor, food, firewood, and charcoal has not decreased compared to the past. The tea shops, suffering from last year's losses, are generally lowering the mountain prices by 20-30 yuan this year. Losing money on tea and losing money on prices, being exploited on both sides, one often sees mountain farmers picking tea under the tea trees, all hanging their heads and secretly complaining.</p>
<p>(Tea Shops' Finances Still Closed) The tea shops stationed in the tea-producing areas used to be keen to attract loans and foreign exchange, but in recent years, a small number of speculative tea shops have failed to control the shops, and in light of the huge losses suffered by the tea shops last year, the tea market has not improved this year, and the financial sources are not smooth. They have all shifted their focus, tightened lending. The reporter recently asked a manager of a certain shop about the business policy this year. He immediately replied without hesitation that the purpose of this year is not to accept customers, and the shops are free to deposit tea at will. The shop's attitude of fatigue and the tightening of lending can be seen from this.</p>
<p>(Tea Shops Opening One After Another) Most of the tea shops in the four villages of this county are solid, but there are also quite a few tea shops that are engaged in speculation without capital. Last year, all the shops suffered universal losses. This year, the original wealthy tea shops are suffering from the depletion of old funds, and it is difficult to raise new funds quickly. Facing this financial closure, it is really a lot of careful planning. Therefore, two weeks ago, there were still very few shops planning to open. Unexpectedly, this week, the new tea picking has started, and the traders who were determined not to talk about the tea business could not help but get excited. In recent days, whether they are wealthy or non-wealthy, new or old tea shops, about 80% of them have been preparing to open their scales, and it seems that they are still continuing to work hard in their business. However, it remains to be seen whether a small number of speculative tea shops can all open their doors, depending on whether or not they can raise funds. At this time, they are just clamoring and joining in the fun.</p>
<p>(Future Prediction of Mountain Prices) The mountain price is related to the cost of boxed tea. In the past ten years, due to the competition among tea shops and the rise in prices, the cost of labor, food, and expenses for mountain farmers has been increasing, from 30 yuan per load to 90 yuan. In the past few years, the tea shops have not been defeated, so in order to compete for new tea mountain prices, they did not have time to consider the price, and they all bought at the same price. Last year, they learned the lesson of heavy capital losses, and this year they cannot help but consider the competition of high and low mountain prices. The shops have recently declared verbally that they will all lower the mountain prices, with some saying that they will offer 30 yuan per load, or 100 yuan for three loads, and some saying that the most they will offer is 40 yuan. If this limit is violated, they will not take a single leaf. Although that is what they say, I don't know whether the mountain farmers who are the owners of the goods will be able to agree to them. According to the reporter's speculation, the price will be around 50 yuan when the scale is opened in the future.</p>
<h3>Ten Raw Silk Tea Farms' Precious Eyebrow Tea Sales Increase in Europe</h3>
<p>Yesterday, English merchants and their firms like Xie He Tong Fu, etc. showed sudden and keen interest on Precious Eyebrow green tea from Lake Huzhou and Anhui produced by local raw silk tea factories, and negotiated for more than 400 cases. Selling price remains unchanged. Scatters of sale were also done for Precious Eyebrow Needle Eyebrow green tea from Wenzhou and Suian, however, the price charged by rich local firm merchants were too tight and negotiation was difficult, it was said.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Surges with Sharp Increase in Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was extremely active and firm due to the soaring gold standard, which reached nearly 1,000 yuan at its peak. The guild quoted 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 20.80 yuan, which later traded at 20.75 yuan for 600 bags, up 0.35 yuan from the previous day. 20 medium granulated white sugar was quoted at 20.02 yuan, up 0.34 yuan. 89 Dutch red sugar was quoted at 16.80 yuan, up 0.40 yuan. Taikoo Granulated White B Grade was quoted at 22.05 yuan, up 0.35 yuan. Factory prices included Changxing's quoted price for RA fine Dutch white sugar at 21.80 yuan, Guanghua Factory's Lu Character at 20.09 yuan, Shou Character at 20.025 yuan, ground granulated sugar plus wide bag at 21.10 yuan, Zhenji Factory's fine white sugar No. 1 at 20.40 yuan, No. 2 at 20.02 yuan, No. 3 at 20.00 yuan, No. 4 at 19.80 yuan, and No. 5 at 19.60 yuan, all up 0.50 yuan from the previous day. 24 coarse granulated white sugar would require 21.50 yuan when calculated according to yesterday's exchange rate, so another increase is expected today. Number plate has Guang Shan help opening dozens of bags of foreign white at 16.6 yuan, 200+ bags of positive grade fine red at the price of 15.4 - 15, Qingchoe sold hundred+ number of bags at 12.7 for Gaohuanggang Qing and 11.5 for Lunggang Qing.

<h3>Scabies and Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>—Xiaozi</p>
<p>丨To Prove That China Will Not Perish丨</p>
<p>In recent days, news reports indicate that the situation in North China is becoming increasingly tense. Those who are concerned about the country have more material for deep discussions. Therefore, some people say, "The abandonment of Rehe, the loss of various ports, the fall of Dolon, and the recent attempt by the enemy to seize west of the Luan River, as well as the aircraft demonstrating towards Tianjin and Beijing, are all due to the inaction of the authorities, who are unwilling to divert some of the forces suppressing bandits to resist Japan. Otherwise, the enemy would not dare to be so rampant."</p>
<p>However, this is ultimately the talk of old fogies, so pedantic as to be unworthy of mention. How could China perish? This gentleman has not studied geometry, so he does not understand the principle that "If angle A equals angle B, and angle B equals angle C, then angle A must also equal angle C." Of course, he also would not know that "To resist foreign aggression, one must first pacify the interior," and even less would he know the profound truth that "Pacifying the interior is resisting foreign aggression!" However, old fogies always pride themselves on their age and do not submit to those who do not accept old age. Therefore, I need to explain and provide detailed evidence.</p>
<p>China! Remember, only China! Currently, there are two enemies. One is the "imperialists," so it is said that we must have an "anti-imperialist" war. The other enemy is China's mortal enemy, which is said to be ten, hundred, thousand, million times more harmful to China than the "imperialist enemy" (this is a fabrication). This enemy is surnamed "Red" and is also named "imperialist." Its alias is "Communist bandit," so we also have wars to "kill Communists" and "suppress bandits." However, the "imperialist enemy" is an external enemy, while the "Communist bandit" is an internal enemy. Therefore, the "Communist bandit" is, of course, much more serious than the "imperialist enemy." For example, if someone suffers from skin diseases such as sores and boils, while another person suffers from heart disease or tuberculosis, soon the person suffering from heart disease or tuberculosis will kick the bucket because it is difficult to treat. The friend with the sores and boils will happily eat steamed dates with lard every day. At most, he will only cut away the rotten flesh or discard a layer of skin. His life will definitely not be ended because of this. To give another example, if you use a small knife to cut off a corner of a plump and delicious pear, even if the skin and flesh change color after a while, it will definitely not breed maggots. But if a chemical reaction occurs inside the core and it rots from the core outward, then there is no cure. Therefore, the "Communist bandit" is like heart disease or tuberculosis, and also like the maggots that cause the core of the pear to rot. If we want to preserve China's old life, we must fundamentally treat it, and it is not enough to capture and trample the "maggots" one by one. As for the "imperialist enemy," it does not matter much, like having scabies, we only need to "cut off" the skin with sores and eat some "steamed dates with lard" and the like.</p>
<p>In recent days, although it is said that the Japanese army is approaching and North China is becoming more dangerous, that is not important. Because the same newspaper also publishes in the same typeface the news of the successive victories of the "bandit suppression" military and the recapture of "bandit" areas and the capture of "bandit" leaders. Is this news not a joyous, astonishing, and even maddening fact that China will definitely not perish?</p>
<p>Moreover, "bandit suppression" also has a side effect, which is a powerful demonstration against the "imperialist enemy." That is to say, don't mess around, I have troops. If you don't believe it, I'll show you!</p>
<p>Old fogies, have you cleared your clogged mind yet?</p>
<h3>Redemption of Pawned Goods</h3>
<p>— Wen Bing</p>
<p>Friends who have been circling back from the accounting office of the newspaper or the counter of the bookstore are mostly clutching their pockets tightly, revealing an unusually excited look. They shrink three steps into two, first striding into the dance hall or the cinema. Then, in the hazy twilight, one can see the thin, elongated shadows of these people reflected in front of the fortress-like pawnshop.</p>
<p>For some reason, the chains of economics, one shackle after another, have bound me. So, on an evening at the end of last month, I, like a petty thief, stealthily and nervously walked to the pawnshop counter that was taller than my head. My ears and cheeks turned red and then green, burning hot. My eyes were also blurred, and I only saw the room spinning. The iron bars that were mounted on the counter seemed to fall one by one on my forehead, causing a bone-piercing pain. In my dazed consciousness, I received the money and rushed back in one breath, lying on the bed, my hands full of cold sweat, my heart pounding.</p>
<p>In theory, I shouldn't be in such an awkward situation. After years of wandering life, entering the pawnshop should be as common as a regular meal, shouldn't it? I should have some experience. Moreover, now that I still have this life and can still go in and out of the pawnshop, in today's China, I can still boast that I am a "quasi-lucky guy." Moreover, even Mr. Lu Xun, the current authority in the literary world, has experienced such a period of life, so what does it matter?</p>
<p>However, I always feel uneasy, as if I have lost my soul.</p>
<p>It was the day before yesterday. I walked out of the newspaper office happily. Passing by the dance hall, my heart felt a little panicked. My consciousness immediately told me that this was not a place you needed to go. Moreover, you haven't had any experience, so how could you go in? Passing by the cinema, I happened to see the screening of a domestically produced masterpiece that was all the rage and had even participated in the Italian International Film Exhibition! The feet of this metropolitan dweller no longer moved forward, so I stopped there.</p>
<p>Coming out of the cinema, according to the usual procedure, I should go to the pawnshop. However, although it was already five o'clock, the sun was still hanging obliquely in the western sky. Experience told me that going to the pawnshop at this time, even if it was to redeem something, my ears and cheeks would still turn red and green. The most annoying thing was that those passersby often glanced at you irrelevantly. I circled around for a long time before the night gradually unfolded. So I went up with an excited heart. Firstly, redeeming something is a relatively honorable thing, and secondly, this time I was able to redeem it in less than a month, which clearly indicated that my life was improving. I remember that the clothes and pants that I pawned in a pawnshop in Zhabei in the winter of the year before last, after the artillery fire of the "January 28th" incident, when I went to inquire about them in April last year, even the pawnshop was gone, which was really annoying. I placed the money on the high counter and called out "Redeem." A greasy fat face appeared inside the iron bars. But I was not embarrassed at all. In the five minutes that I stood waiting, I was the only one redeeming something, but the space under the high counter was crowded with customers, and people were still pouring in at the door, men, women, old, young, tall, short, rickshaw pullers, young men in suits, poorly dressed poor women, and fashionable girls in cheongsams and leather shoes, each with an unstable soul and an unstable look, staring at the greasy fat face inside the iron bars. "This business is really good!" I praised silently. Suddenly, an old hunched woman appeared at the door. "That is a true pauper!" I turned and thought to myself. "Four jiao and six fen of interest!" I suddenly turned my eyes to look at the sign that read "Monthly interest of one fen and eight li," and couldn't help but blurt out, "This is where high-interest loans are exploited!"</p>
<p>"That is a true pauper!" "Four jiao and six fen of interest!" "Monthly interest of one fen and eight li!" "This is where high-interest loans are exploited!" On the way home, I kept repeating these words, as if a dilapidated social scene was playing before my eyes.</p>

<h3>A Visit to the Second Jiangsu Prison</h3>
<p>— Tinghua</p>
<p>Every graduating class of the Law Department of our school (China Public School) visits not only the courts in various districts but also various prisons for practical study and research. The other day (the 14th), along with classmates Jiang Zhanggen, Wen Bing, and others, a group of forty-six people led by Professor Yang of our school went to Caohejing to visit the Second Jiangsu Prison. That morning at nine o'clock, we gathered at the school on Route Tenant in the French Concession and hired several large cars, which took us directly to our destination. We first entered the reception room, where the warden of the prison, Tian Zhongfu, gave a talk. He said briefly that the prison has about 1,800 inmates, including 1,500 criminal offenders and 300 military offenders. Most of the criminal offenders are sent by the local courts, while the military offenders are sent by the garrison headquarters and the security department. The food rations and treatment for criminal offenders and military offenders are different. The daily cost per person for criminal offenders is one jiao, and for military offenders, it is one jiao and five fen. The reason for the difference is that the Ministry of the Army, the Economic School, and the Ministry of Justice are more affluent. In addition, there are two foreign offenders, whose food rations cost three jiao per person per day. The preferential treatment for foreign offenders is the same in all countries. He (Tian, referring to himself) had previously held prison positions in Harbin and other places. He had only taken over here for four or five months. Regarding military offenders, this place has always advocated leniency. However, if their words and actions are too loud and unrestrained, their freedom has been slightly restricted recently, so these people inevitably have many complaints. We then visited the prison cells. The cells were specially built in a gear shape. One room at the axle of the gear is like a pavilion, with eight sides. One side is a corridor, and the remaining seven are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F, and G, each connected to more than a dozen prison cells. The guards can see all the alleyways of the cells from the center by looking around, which is the reason for such construction, for easy management of the prisoners. (1) Block A, with dozens of cells, is for military offenders and was not convenient to visit. (2) Most of the doors of the dozens of cells in Block B were open. Each door had a number (prisoners are not identified by name but by a number). There were at least eight and at most twelve people in each cell. At the end of the cell alley was the First Workshop, which was the rope-making section and the box-pasting section. The prisoners were all working, half making zongzi ropes and half pasting matchboxes. The managers supervised them, just like in an ordinary workshop. (3) The houses in Blocks C to G were constructed similarly, but the workshops at the end of the cell alleys were different. For example, the end of the alley in Block C was called the Second Workshop, which was a printing house. Typesetters, printers, and bookbinders were all working there without any sign of fatigue. (4) The end of the alley in Block D was the education hall, which had a sewing section and a wool-picking section. The prisoners were all sitting quietly in the education hall and were not seen working. (5) The end of the alley in Block E was the Third Workshop, which was the knitting section, i.e., making socks; the Fourth Workshop was the box-pasting section, i.e., pasting matchboxes; and the Fifth Workshop was the weaving section. The prisoners were all working and seemed quite skilled. (6) The end of the alley in Block F was the Sixth Workshop, which was the yarn-reeling section and the bamboo and wood section, with nothing particularly special. We then went to visit the women's prison. That day, there were a total of 142 female inmates, most of whom were making white bamboo cloth handkerchiefs, and some were making children's clothes and lace, as if it were a women's vocational training center. Judging by their expressions, they seemed to have forgotten that they were in prison. (7) The infirmary had an examination room and equipment such as medicines. (8) The kitchen was where food and drink were prepared for the inmates. The rice and vegetables were, of course, rough and simple and could not be compared with those of ordinary people, but they were still clean and fresh, and attention was paid to hygiene. There were also barbering and bathing sections, but we did not have time to visit them before returning, it was said.</p>
<h3>Frog Sounds</h3>
<p>— Qiong</p>
<p>The nanny left, leaving a baby just over a year old crying in my arms. To make the baby quiet for a while, I held him and wandered in the countryside near the city.</p>
<p>It was dusk at this time. Spring had not completely left, and everything still retained the vitality of youth. I wandered here, and I temporarily felt satisfied with this illusory life. The strangest thing was that the baby stopped crying at this time and quietly listened to the noisy frog sounds around him, and later even fell asleep on my shoulder.</p>
<p>Ah! These frog sounds, I began to understand the beauty of these frog sounds. But this caused my desolate homesickness and the melancholy of past events.</p>
<p>I remember at this time five years ago, our group of officer political school classmates was setting off for the countryside for field training. We killed, we charged, we ran between the mountains, we rested in the vast plains. We held a short carbine in our hands, and we carried bullets on our backs. Whenever we were tired and sleepy, we listened quietly to the war drum-like frog sounds. In their songs, the power of youthful and vigorous life flowed throughout. But we were very cruel after all. Several times we caught several small frogs that had not even shed their tails and conveniently executed them, because the destruction of this small life would not leave any traces in my personal heart, at least. Indeed, at that time I flaunted my youth, and I was determined to gather the greatest strength to break through the dark encirclement. I wanted to seek liberation for myself, and I longed for the light of the future. I entrusted my life to this carbine, and I aimed at imperialism and all enemies.</p>
<p>However, this life of "power" finally flowed away gently like a dream. Everything five years ago is now just an empty memory. Now, what I am holding in my hands is not a carbine but a baby. I have become</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>the mother of this new life. My career, my future, I entrust to this child. I am almost... what? Ah! A virtuous wife and good mother!</p>

<h3>Land Requisition</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Recently, our Xiangshan County is planning to build a motor road. The route has already been surveyed and will start construction soon. Yesterday, I received a letter from home saying that this road will cut across my five-mu field.</p>
<p>Sir, of course, I cannot oppose this matter, but does this mean that my five-mu field will be sacrificed? Please give me an explanation. I respectfully ask,</p>
<p>Zhang Naiwen, Ze'an</p>
<p>××××</p>
<p>Editor's Note: According to the current laws of our country, the government, in order to build roads or other public buildings, may, when necessary, requisition land from the people. The owners of the land being requisitioned may not resist, so Mr. Zhang cannot oppose this matter at all.</p>
<p>As for the requisition of land, it does not mean that it can be occupied casually. The government should determine the land price with reference to local conditions. Therefore, Mr. Zhang's land, after being requisitioned, can obtain a corresponding price. However, this price is estimated by the government and cannot be bargained by you. Speaking of the payment of this land price, some are paid in cash at once, and some are paid in installments, which is uncertain, but the government must have a clear indication in advance, and all households are treated equally, without distinction.</p>
<p>After your five-mu field is used to build the road, it probably won't be completely gone. The remaining field is still yours; the government absolutely cannot circle a fraction more than what is needed for building the road. Conversely, you cannot force the government to buy the field that is left over after the road construction. However, if the field that is left over is less than one fen and is not connected to your other fields, then if you are willing, the government should buy it all together at a price. The principle of land requisition is nothing more than this; as for the detailed rules, they vary from place to place, but they cannot violate this principle.</p>

<h3>The Life of the Five Beauties (10) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>However, even so, Miss Liu could still enjoy some leisure: this was very clear to Wu Gui. For example, Master Zhang earned five yuan a month in Shanghai and sent it home, and he also had many savings in Beijing that could be withdrawn at any time. So Miss Liu was also happy. She could buy several sets of fashionable clothes every month. Wu Gui took care of everything inside and outside (the reason she brought Wu Gui here was for this), and she could listen to operas, play cards, and even play the erhu and sing a few lines when she was happy. Everyone in the neighborhood envied her for having accumulated so much merit in her previous life, so that she could enjoy such good fortune in this life.</p>
<p>But soon she gradually became bored. What made her most angry was the time when a steward was suddenly sent back from his post and broke into her room in the middle of the night. Later, according to Wu Gui's guess, it was probably the First Madam who intentionally instructed him to do this to see if she was doing anything bad. This made her unhappy for several days. Sometimes she was determined to sneak out with a wild man to vent her anger, but she couldn't muster up that kind of interest for a while and hadn't done it until now.</p>
<p>Today, she was casually holding a novel, lying lazily on the bed. In the middle of reading, she suddenly came across these two sentences:</p>
<p>"… You are living in happiness, but you are not aware of it and are tired of happiness…"</p>
<p>So she gently closed the book and closed her eyes as if she was lost in thought.</p>
<p>The spring sunlight was blown into the window by the cool breeze, ironing on her face, and leaving two shallow tear marks at the corners of her eyes.</p>
<p>(10) Now She Belongs To Our People</p>
<p>God's tricks on people are often both funny and sad. For example, now that Miss Liu had married into the Zhang family, she should have continued to live in a peaceful and simple time, but God's intention was not like that. Master Zhang happened to die when his official career was at its peak. Moreover, he died very strangely. It was said that he didn't have any serious illness, but he just had a boil on his back that caused him to writhe in pain for three days and three nights before kicking the bucket and dying. He didn't even have time to give good instructions for his funeral, only instructing Miss Liu that she must remarry.</p>
<p>According to the old masters who had reached a certain age, this kind of death was because the underworld used a weighing hook to hook his spine, and it was inevitable for someone who was not honest as an official to die like this. However, it was not always the case. As Wu Gui, my brother, said, who could go to the underworld to take a trip? Who had seen it? Moreover, although Master Zhang was a little corrupt, he may not have harmed anyone's life. How many officials looted, but not one of them died clean. So no one can figure out God's affairs.</p>
<p>However, our Miss Liu was now divorced from the Zhang family. First, the First Madam never liked such a... Her heart thought:</p>
<p>"Oh! Don't bother, who can take care of so much?"</p>
<p>Outside it was still raining, depressing rain. She thought deeply without a clue, and she herself was a little unsure; why had it suddenly become like this?</p>

<h3>The Youth-Preserving Art of Female Stars</h3>
<p>— Xing Zhi</p>
<p>Maintaining the Beauty of the Era of Twenty-Nine Years</p>
<p>Hollywood has this saying: "Movie actors have no age limit. From eighteen to eighty, anyone can be a star." But this statement is ultimately deceptive. Look at the many movie stars in Hollywood. Apart from Mary MacLaren, who is willing to play an aging old woman on the screen? Who doesn't want to play a charming young girl like a twenty-nine-year-old? Although very few are truly eighteen years old, several middle-aged women like Mary Pickford, Rose Talbot, Claire Windsor, Billie Burke, Marlene Dietrich, Lila Lee, and Gloria Swanson, if you don't know their age, who wouldn't say they are only seventeen or eighteen years old?</p>
<p>To gain a foothold in the film industry, they must of course maintain their youthful beauty. And maintaining youthful beauty has its secrets. This is not a temporary beauty treatment achieved by cosmetics, but a permanent way to prevent the skin from developing wrinkles and appearing old. Although this "permanent" can only last until around forty years old, it is still a major lesson in addition to the work of a movie actor. Mary Pickford's appearance can be said to be the most ageless among the stars. Her youth-returning technique is certainly very refined. She once said to people: "I believe that the word 'happiness' is the first element in avoiding aging. I often say that today's matters should be dealt with today, and I don't worry about yesterday's or tomorrow's matters. To put it bluntly, life is just this one thing. Only the present is precious, and there is no need to dwell on the past or worry about the future." This can be said to be Pickford's philosophy. Pickford is indeed the happiest person in Hollywood, and no one can make her angry. And after work, she always travels everywhere, leaving all worries behind. So her current charm is no less than when she was a teenager.</p>
<p>Rose Talbot said: "Aging" follows one's mood. One's mind should always be broader. I am not afraid of aging, but the more afraid, the easier it is to age. This must be known." Rose was a small star in 1909, but she is still very young.</p>
<p>Claire Windsor was called the most beautiful woman in Hollywood in 1920, and she is still as beautiful as she was thirteen years ago. According to her own words, she has never spent more than five minutes applying powder. She believes that powder is something that ruins people's appearance. There are also Lila Lee and Gloria Swanson, who are all skilled in this youth-preserving art.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of Men Must Fight</h3>
<p>— Zhou Yan</p>
<p>Distorted Consciousness, Excellent Techniques</p>
<p>In the extremely depressed current state of Hollywood, film companies are racking their brains to find a way out. This "Men Must Fight" was produced in this special situation. It takes the Second World War as its theme, although it is speculative, it is still imaginable that they admit to the inevitability of the Second World War. Of course, this drama will never advocate anti-imperialist aggressive war. On the contrary, it is the agitator of this cruel war. But is this the way out for American films? We can definitely say it is a "dead end." It escapes reality, grasps only dreams, and attempts to use narrow nationalistic concepts to mobilize people to participate in aggressive wars. The only excuse is that "peace cannot be spoken of without force." We believe that future wars can never be explained by national concepts, nor can they be eliminated by humanitarian pacifism. This film explains that Bob hates war because of Westworth, but later, after learning from his mother that his biological father was a martyr who died for his country, he flew a plane to participate in the war. This is obviously the most effective anesthetic.</p>
<p>In summary, the main significance of this film is entirely to flaunt the power of the American Air Force, preparing for and inciting the Second Massacre.</p>
<p>Although we say that it is distorted in consciousness, we cannot deny its success in technique. For example, the planes in the sky and the bombing of New York City are all very beautiful scenes. Although the destruction of huge buildings is fake, there is no trace of fabrication on the screen. Here we cannot help but admire their skillful use of light.</p>
<p>Of course, the best actor is Diana Wynyarde, who plays Laura, but in the end, I think she is too young, because after 1919 until 194, this long period of more than twenty years does not show any increase in age on her face.</p>
<p>Laura's ex-husband died in battle. When he was carried into the hospital, Laura discovered it before entering the door, and discovered that the deceased was her husband from the ornaments on his clothes. This subtle action is certainly the director's cleverness.</p>

<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>After Viewing "New Year's Eve"</h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>The Consciousness is Narrow and Not of the Masses</p>
<p>The plot of this film revolves around the essence of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness that unfolds during the twelve hours of New Year's Eve. This is indeed novel. However, because the time frame is so short, the director cannot provide detailed portrayals of the characters' backgrounds and personalities. Therefore, the audience only receives a partial impression, lacking a complete emotional experience. In this regard, it falls short of "Morning of the City" and "Night of the City."</p>
<p>Regarding the consciousness conveyed, we dare not say it is sound. In the current era, films with socialist themes should seek natural development through the "determination" of individuals or groups, not rely on traditional ideas of "old morality" and "old etiquette" to solve everything. The film ends with a wealthy banker generously donating money to pay off the debts of the old scholar Liu. However, can every poor person encounter such a generous person? And does such generosity even exist in modern society? Regarding these two points, we can see that the consciousness of "New Year's Eve" is narrow and not of the masses.</p>
<h3>After Watching "New Year's Eve"</h3>
<p>— Feng Ying</p>
<p>The Director's Skills Are Still Quite Exquisite</p>
<p>The long-awaited "New Year's Eve" has finally been released to the public in Beijing. When the reporter arrived at 5 o'clock, the seats were already almost full. From this, we can see that the audience has a considerable affection for domestic films.</p>
<p>The story of the film is very simple, only depicting several different comedies of sorrow, joy, separation, and reunion in just a few hours of a day.</p>
<p>The debt collector in the plot tells us that one should be subservient to the rich but fierce and intimidating to the poor. As for the scene where the debt collector, having lost the money, attempts to drown himself, it is illogical for him to suddenly say, "We should strive to break this terrible environment" after encountering the old man. How could he understand the need for active struggle yet attempt suicide over three hundred yuan?</p>
<p>The meaning is mediocre, but the director's skills are still quite exquisite, and the pacing is tight.</p>
<p>As for the actors, Liu Jiqun, in such a heroic role, shows us the Oriental Harold Lloyd. This change in style undoubtedly shows significant progress. Chen Yanyan, in "Spring in the South" and "Struggle," has already given us a deep impression. This time, she can even better display her artistic talent. Jiang Junchao's expressions are very realistic, and the rest are commendable.</p>
<h3>My View of "New Year's Eve"</h3>
<p>— Chen Benrong</p>
<p>Pointing Out Several Far-Fetched Aspects</p>
<p>The title is very beautiful, but the script's fantasy and the structure's forced nature are regrettable. Fortunately, the director worked hard, and it is still a good work. In addition to the plot already reviewed, there are still several inconsistencies, as follows:</p>
<p>1.  The dance hall manager gives Third Sister 300 yuan to buy a dancer, but Third Sister – a cunning woman – doesn't deduct any commission when giving it to the old man's wife. And the old man's wife – who had taken the money the old man pawned to repay gambling debts – also gives the full amount to the old man. Isn't this a bit contradictory?</p>
<p>2.  The old man's daughter becomes a dancer, both willingly and then runs back home.</p>
<p>3.  The aspiring young volunteer wants to commit suicide over 300 yuan, and tells the old man, "We must strive to overcome all difficulties," but then innocently accepts the old man's money without refusing, and the amount is conveniently just right.</p>
<p>4.  Teaching someone to dance in a few hours and then having them perform on stage is too fast.</p>
<p>5.  The dance hall's business is very good, so its income must be good; how could it be in debt to the money lender?</p>
<p>As for the director, he is indeed very dedicated. He does not use subtitles to resolve the difficulties in the visuals. In terms of technique: such as the close-up when the old man returns the money to the rich lady, and the teacup in the old man's home having no tea, these are good. The leads, Chen Yanyan and Liu Jiqun, are the best, and the supporting actress Xing Shaomei is better. This film is entirely night scenes, but the kitchen in the old man's house is too bright. The snow on the ground looks real, but the falling snow is all paper, etc. These small mistakes should be avoided in future productions.</p>
<h3>After Watching "New Year's Eve"</h3>
<p>— Yu Jiaqing</p>
<p>Made Me Discover a New Star</p>
<p>"New Year's Eve" depicts the "hardships" and "difficulties" of poor people passing the New Year. The general story is about an old man who is pressured by many debt collectors on New Year's Eve, and his wife sells their daughter to a dance hall to be a dancer. Unexpectedly, the dance hall manager abuses and bullies her. She is desperate and still runs back home. Later, the old man helps a young man in need, and in the end, the young man and the money lender help the old man out of his predicament.</p>
<p>Actors such as Liu Jiqun have completely changed their style, with no trace of comedic elements. Chen Yanyan's performance shows significant progress compared to her previous roles. Jiang Junchao gives the most successful performance in this film. I say he is about to occupy an important position in the film industry, and will be a new star of 1933. The other actors do not have any special performances.</p>
<h3>The Movie Novel "The White Sister" (Part One)</h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>Produced by MGM, Starring Helen Hayes</p>
<p>Sacrificing Reputation and Happiness for Love</p>
<p>Inside the church, Angela sits between her father and her fiancé, attending mass. She feels that her life is as fulfilling and beautiful as the rose window of the chapel, charming, and with a touch of emptiness. At the end of the service, Pastor Sala Sinnaser announces from the pulpit for the third time the good news of the upcoming marriage of Ennas Duto and Angela, the beloved daughter of Quito Shermont.</p>
<p>Her father's hand gently takes Angela's jade arm, giving a gesture of affection. She repays him with a sweet smile. She does not feel a sting in her heart for this formal announcement that is enough to move her. She has accepted her father's marriage arrangement for her as she unquestioningly and unremarkably obeys the other plans her father makes for her. Prince Shermont listens to this report and sincerely thanks God for the success of the good deed.</p>
<p>As the piano plays the closing hymn of the service, they rise and walk out of the dimness of the church into the bright sunlight on the stone steps. The scenery here is beautiful, a world apart from the state of mind when attending mass. A carnival is being held in the square, with dazzling sights and sounds, the waves of laughter echoing the piano music coming from the church.</p>
<p>Relatives and friends gather around, vying to congratulate the engaged couple, but Angela looks distracted at the lively carnival, feeling endless interest. As her father helps her into the car, she repeatedly looks back, expressing her reluctance to leave the carnival. As the car starts, she says eagerly:</p>
<p>"Should we take that road? We can watch the dancing – don't you like to watch dancing, Ennas Duto?"</p>
<p>"Not very much." Ennas Duto smiles at her, and her father shakes his head, as if the request is unworthy of attention.</p>
<p>"Look at their faces, Father! They're so interesting," Angela says, gazing out the car window as it passes by. "Every day should be a carnival day! There should always be music! And dancing!"</p>
<p>Seeing that her father and fiancé are not listening to her, her enthusiasm fades away. They casually chat, getting along well. However, Angela leans over, sticks her head out of the window, and throws her purse to a beggar on the side of the road. The old woman thanks her repeatedly, and Angela smiles sweetly, their conversation interrupted by this incident.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, Ennas Duto," she says quickly, apologizing when she sees a look of displeasure on his face. "I'm sorry, Father." She sits back, her slender arms crossed over her chest, as if to hold the fleeting pleasure tightly in her heart.</p>
