<h3>由妥洽到團結　梓</h3>
<p>二十八日中常會通過五全大會展期舉行案國人之期望政治刷新政權解放於五全大會者聆此消息必將爲之失望雖然吾人就國内妥洽之一點言則國民當中央幹部此舉。其委屈求全之苦衷。亦未始不能予人共諒。</p>
<p>國民黨全國代表大會每二年舉行一次。本爲黨章所規定。此五全大會所以特别爲國人所注意者。以其將討論提前召集國民大會案。與國民黨之開放政權有甚大之關係也。查（擬定民國二十四年三月開國民大會。）爲去年十二月二十日四届三中全會所議决。本年三月。中常會因擬提前召集國民大會。乃有七月一日開全國臨時代表大會討論决定之决議。嗣因廣東方面借詞反對。六月一日中常會本消弭黨内誤會之旨。復議决取消臨時會。依黨章二十七條。於十一月十二日開五全大會。五全大會之主要議題。仍爲提前召集國民大會。則固可想像而知者。今更因西南委員之請停止召集。將五全大會展至明年十一月舉行矣。此臨時全代會之取消與五全大會之展期。即所以委曲求全以就妥治。又可想見也。惟吾人希望國民黨中央幹部於妥洽求免糾紛以外。更進一步由取適當之途徑。以求團結之實現。庶免因黨内渙散而遺害於國家也。</p>
<p>以言團結之實現。則諸事之公開宣布。尤爲必要。今日之下。外人對我。已十目而視讐我者固伺機以覓取製造謠言之資料即愛我者亦難禁其不以神經過敏之故。觀察失其實在。懦恃主持中樞之人。用極端公開態度以遏止謠言之流播。然後隔閡全除。團結可期。外以應付國際之環境。内以求國内之大團結。否則謠傳之起。足以製造猜忌。足以摇撼人心。大足以妨礙團結之成功也。</p>
<p>吾人非不求五全大會之如期舉行。國民大會之及早召集。以討得開放政權之便宜。惟是就實際上觀察。黨之全體。若不先團結一致。則一切良法美意。均無從談起。今國民黨中央幹部爲不得已而以妥洽免糾紛。更希望其由不得已之妥洽以進於大團結也。</p>

<h3>汪精衛昨晚來滬</h3>
<p>態度積極謂今晚夜車卽返京</p>
<p>此來訪晤宋子文商財政問題</p>
<p>昨日、本埠突傳汪蔣宋倦勤説、一時滿城風雨、旋經宋財長堅决表示否認、汪院長亦於昨晚十一時五十分由京抵滬、表示毫不消極、謂在滬勾留日、明日（即今日）夜車即返京、謠言當可盡息矣、各情分誌如下、</p>
<p>宋否認辭職</p>
<p>各報社記者因於昨日下午訪晤財政部長宋子文於財部辦事處、宋謂、本人絶對無辭職之説、一二日内即入京、值茲國難嚴重時期、汪院長積極負責、絶無消極之意、蔣委員長亦然、邇來謠言屢起、幾無從一一糾正、故當局對之毫不重視、亦不願常有表示云、</p>
<p>汪昨晚來滬</p>
<p>行政院長汪精衛、偕同鐵道部次長曾仲鳴、於昨日下午五時二十五分、乘滬平聯運車、附掛ＰＣＭ２花車、由京來滬、昨晚十一時四十八分、車抵眞茹站、汪曾即在該站下車、逕乘汽車返蒲石路寓邸休息、眞茹站由武裝警士嚴密戒備、往站歡迎者、有汪夫人陳璧君女士、市一吳鐵城·及汪氏戚屬等數人訪宋商財政</p>
<p>汪氏昨　深灰色綢長衫、精神似頗不振、本報記者、在車站趨、晤談、訽以外傳消極事、汪謂、謠言太多、聽之可也、無足介意、余留滬一日、明晚（即今晚）夜車即返京、容明日與君詳談云云、又據吳市長謂、汪氏來滬係訪晤財宋、商談財政問題云、</p>
<h3>吳市長談汪宋辭職完全不確</h3>
<p>大美晚報登載失實殊爲憾事</p>
<p>中央社云、昨日大美晚報登載汪院長辭職來滬消息、突如其來、引起社會不安、據吳市長對中央社記者發表談話云、本日（即昨日）下午一時、本人接汪院長電告、此次來滬、將與宋部長孔總裁利用星期假日、晤商財政事項云云、外問誤傳汪院長辭職宋財長消極息、完全不確究不知此項消息、何息而來、報館不察、　爾登載、致使社會感覺不安、殊爲憾事云、</p>
<h3>首批美棉昨日運到</h3>
<p>共一萬一千三百五十件</p>
<p>四千五百包上招商華棧</p>
<p>陳光甫任棉業統制主任</p>
<p>我國政府向美國借欵所購棉花第一批由美國紐弄聯起裝、鄒福來洋行貨輪（愛珊亞聯）號Ethanallen承運尚在八月十五日離美、經過航程四十五天、始於昨日上午抵埠、前數日、財政當局對於該輪行期、與進口時刻十分秘密、即輪公司方面、亦不允將該船到滬確期宣言告、僅秘密知照招商局、準備該棉上棧及碼頭停卸手續耳、福來洋行、在一週前、即接得該輪船主電告、確知昨日可以進口、故早經通告財部在滬所設美棉管理辦事處、迨至　日七午十時、該輪開進吳淞、當由領港引内浦江、到浦東招商局華棧碼頭停泊、至十一時四十分停靠完竣、</p>
<p>運到總數</p>
<p>愛珊亞倫號船内所載美棉、總數共有一萬一千三百五十件、統係借欵美棉、故來貨輪單上、均列有我國政府購入户名、惟内有六千八百五十包、已爲某方購去、將歸受主提取、故實際卸入招商華棧碼頭者、聞祇有四千五百包船中尙有　土古火油一部、</p>
<p>下午上棧</p>
<p>我國向美借欵棉花、總數共有四百萬件、（前傳二十餘萬件、完全不符）計價美金四千萬元、財部特在美國設有管理購棉裝運機關、且有出售之權、如購户在美國訂購、可直接由美派船運往、其中運滬上棧之棉、亦並非全數爲待沽之貨、亦有已經購定、而上棧待購户出卸提取者、（愛珊亞倫）號輪中棉花、昨日下午一時起、即在浦東華棧、開始啓艙上陸、堆儲棧内、以備陸續售出、</p>
<p>擴大堆棧</p>
<p>招商局因此次美棉、爲數甚夥、即就堆存及上棧之費、亦須數十萬元、該局以國營地位、取得獨家堆存之權、惟因數額過巨、華棧雖大、勢難全容、因之費去三萬七千餘元、將揚子碼頭、及附建各貨棧加工趕修、以供大批美棉陸續運滬後存儲、又爲購户提取上便利關係、或須將美棉一部、存入金利源碼頭貨棧中、亦不得不預爲計及、惟南棧浦江、吃水較淺、較大海輪、不能靠停、則將妨害起卸、因之在上星期、又與濬浦局特訂挖泥及疏導該叚浦江合同、共須費去挖泥濬浦等用費二萬元左右、刻下亦已動工趧挖、今回招商局爲承堆美棉之故、共費去六萬元修濬巨欵、但收入上則數倍於支出也、</p>
<p>繼續運來</p>
<p>今次運滬美棉福來洋行取得大部分運輸權、他如美輪公司、亦有攬得裝運者照總數四百萬件、若全運到滬、至少需用商輪一百五十艘、該棉悉在新亞聯海港上艙、第二批美棉運來上海、據記者所聞、須在十月下旬、方可到達、十一月十二月分、則大批擁到矣、但此次借欵美棉、與去年借欵美麥、專供振災者不同、　因有市面關係、故當局力守秘密、不願將到滬日期預告耳、</p>
<p>統制委會</p>
<p>新聲社云、財政部長宋子文氏、前以美棉到滬在即、關於推銷及支配問題、特聘上海銀行總理陳光甫爲棉業統制委員會主任、以陳氏與紗業及金融界、均有相當關係也、該項組織、業經宋部長徵得陳氏同意、即將着手籌備、昨日上午九時、陳氏已在上海銀行、邀請金融紗業兩界有關係人物·一度作非正式討論、交換人選及組織計劃、内容因尚未至公佈時期、暫緩發表、爲悉陳氏爲避免歷來虚浮組織、注重實際工作起見、委員人選至多在十五人左右、其進行計劃、凡關於改良耔、培養植棉、通暢運輸、碾花紡紗、以至於組織成布、運轉推銷等、咸受統制委員會之統制指導、其第一步已確定從改良種耔、培植棉田入手、現在尚須俟經濟委員會於下星期一改組成立、汪孫宋三常委就職後、經决議通過、命令發表即可成立、其日期當在下星期中矣、至於内部組織之一切條約、不日亦可送立法院審核通過、</p>

<p>今次返國、非來做官、故極願在　内從事民營航空事業、擬先由個人獨立辦一飛行社訓練飛行人才、計劃在滬西闢一飛機塲、購機三數架、有志於航空事業之青年、均得報名入學、訓練駕駛飛行、一二二閱月後、即可畢業、此項事業、在華雖屬創舉、在海外已司空見慣矣、余擬明春更渡英倫、一續深造軍事航空技術、聞中國航空恊會十二架命禮、即將舉行、届時頗願駕機表演、引起民衆對航空軍事業之興趣云云、</p>

<h3>劉毓桂庭長對奸商嫉惡如仇</h3>
<p>日紗冒充國貨案諭令不得任意起滅</p>
<p>申新如欲撤回控訴須得檢察官同意</p>
<p>十奸商倘再抗傳不到即將出票拘捕</p>
<p>丨劉庭長維護國家法紀之精神可佩丨</p>
<p>工足襪廠·三陽棉織廠·久益織廠·鼎新布廠·裕東襪廠·均昌染織廠·沄洲染織廠·永源絲光廠·義興號·通和染織廠·等十家廠號、向以販賣日貨爲業、自暴日侵略東北、國人奮起救亡、一致抵制仇貨以來、該十家廠號祗知圖利、不惜自貶人格、依然大販仇貨、因恐一旦敗露、不容於衆、乃將仇貨棉紗、改頭換面、冒充申新第五廠之人鐘牌、變造稅單、朦混稅務機關起運、此種技倆、不但妨害申新、抑且　　欺騙政府</p>
<p>嗣經蘇浙皖區統稅局查悉、知照申新五廠、派員審查明晰、始由該廠經理榮偉仁延孫祖基律師·對該奸商余錫蕃·陳仲賢·王三煒·孫心袒·郁愉忻·周松茂·柴志香·趙炳南·王根生·管秉初·等提起刑事控訴、請求按律治罪、並着賠償損失洋、</p>
<p>二十萬元</p>
<p>業經第一特區地方法院一度開庭、因各被告俱畏罪不到、遂予延期、惟該奸商等深知此事已不齒於衆口、若再身膺國法制裁、更將無地自容、爰曾央求杜月笙·王曉籟·二君向申新方面調解申新方面、亦曾表示接受、各情已詳昨報惟對於雙方如何解决條件、雖憑申新方面傳出、有由十廠號提欵交付黄河水災會、作爲賑欵、並未另附他項要求消息後但外間尚</p>
<p>傳説不一</p>
<p>因此昨日庭訊時之雙方態度、實堪注意、亦可謂本案進行和解後之程度測騐也、昨日下午二時、係續審之期、仍由劉毓桂庭長升坐第二刑庭審理、詎各被告竟仍抗傳不到、僅由各被告辯護律師到庭、聲請繼續展期、並謂目下雙方尚有和解之可能性云、繼原告代理律師孫祖基亦起稱、原告對於斯案旣已提起控訴、自應靜候</p>
<p>法律解决</p>
<p>同時各被告依理亦難逃國法制裁至於和解、因市商會方面、曾出任調停、未便固拒、更恐本案成立後、被告等所得之結果、將不堪設想、故原告對於和解、尚在考慮、惟被告要求改期、似可同意云、當時劉庭長旣悉上情乃即席宣稱云、查普通案件、果可於和解成熟時期、向本院撤回控訴、惟本案關係重大、逈非普通案件可比旣經起訴、不得任意起滅、即使本案果能和解、原告擬向本院撤回控訴、則本院亦須</p>
<p>向檢察官</p>
<p>徵求意見或同意、豈當事人所可自由、同時本案兩次開庭、各被告均不到庭受鞫、實屬藐視本院之尊嚴、輕褻國家法紀、茲姑准再予展期一次、定十月七日下午二時複審、斯時被告律師即起稱、在十月七日左右、辯護人適有通州之行、請求庭上將複審日期、延至十月十日之後、經由劉庭長駁回、並宣稱本案費時已久、且屢請展期、致未切實審理、故祇准提早</p>
<p>不准展遲</p>
<p>遂諭准展至十月六日下午二時重審、本院當再票傳各被告到案、仰被告辯護律師將本院意旨轉知各被告届期務須投案候訊、倘再敢抗違、本院爲維持法紀、定即出票拘捕、辯護律師乃唯唯而退、同時探悉統稅署方面、對於斯案已準備手續、擬即繼起控訴、昨日庭訊時、該局職員、</p>

<h3>英荷兩屬華僑教育現狀談</h3>
<p>記者頃晤新從南洋荷　蘇門答臘歸來之教育界人士黄康屯君、黄君旅南執教在英荷兩屬先後凡六年、對於僑社情形與其親身經騐之華僑教誜實况、所談頗中肯綮、據稱英荷兩屬之僑教事業、以當地政府所取策略之寛嚴不同、（例如英屬缅甸最寛、海峽殖民地較嚴、荷屬東印度爲最、）與當地僑社努力程度之差異、顯有軒輇、惟其受其景氣之響影、迫而人於憔悴减縮之狀態、則彼此相同、蓋華僑之在南洋、雖以歷史之久、數量之衆、但祖國政府旣愛莫能助、華僑自身又不容有堅强之組織、教費之來源、僅持商家月捐、僑社自定規例之貨物捐、臨時勸募之特别捐　等、高塲冷淡、此種經費之來源、日見朒縮僑校因而停閉或减縮、而不能有蓬勃向上之氣象、近如蘇島東海岸省一帶、糖米雜貨商互相團結、與外國船公司商定抽取載運費之一甘仙、一作爲公積金、以撥充僑界慈善事業之經費、不啻爲僑教開一新生機、故前途頗有發展建設之企圖、蘇東首埠之棉蘭自小學至中學、均里女同校、而風紀甚好、且各　行政統一、有通盤籌劃之公團與辦事人員、辦學方法、非常經濟、此點爲英屬各埠所不及、</p>
<p>次談及僑校教料書問題、謂教科書爲僑意精神上之食料、貴能因時因地、英荷兩屬華校所採用之教科書、大都係商務中華兩家舊物、間亦不採用世界開明等書局出版物者、惟均須經過殖民政府所屬漢務司或政治部檢查准許、方可採用、課文中偶有涉及新頴思　或不爲檢查者所喜之語句、卽全書禁用、故多數祇得沿用民十三以前之舊教科書、不特不合當地之時與地、抑且非祖國現前之時與境、至於政治思想、則絶對不許在校内灌輪、例如蘇島某中學教育科中採用小學行政一書當局因見書面有行政及組織字様、遂將該書送至最高當局檢查、歷兩月而尚未發　也、關於編制僑校適用之各科教材問題、旅南之教育界人員旣大多無暇或無力爲之、而國内時局之編輯者、又或未嘗身歷其境而類於閉門造車、此决非渺小問題也、又次論及荷屬對於知識階級之入口手續非常周密、盤請無微不至、卽由英屬轉坡、亦必經同様嚴密之手續、所報情形、　有參差、則登岸不久、仍　放歷、其已歌得居留證及教員紙者、行動言論、隨詩有喑採注意、恩想精新、不甘於守口如瓶之教員或記者、三字之獻、且夕不測、輕則遍知停職、重則立　　絏、已屬司空見慣矣、報紙刋物之郵遞、檢查亦極嚴、荷屬較英屬爲尤基、例如生活週刋、論語半月刋、在英屬可以公開發售、而荷屬只能作私貨夾帶、蓋不但諱忌革命、抑且禁人（幽默）矣、意下相與啞然、</p>

<h3>長生術</h3>
<p>— 孫文潤</p>
<p>無論是什麽人，誰不希望自已能夠長生不老；一生永不會有死的一回悲哀。國家，隨它是在古今中外，全國的元首和人民，當然也没有不希望能與天地同休戚，永不會遇到亡國的慘痛。</p>
<p>秦始皇，他自做了皇，錦　的江山，固然是早讓他統着；但是他還忽一統的山河，能夠萬年億萬年·····的在自已統治之下長存；永不更這秦朝一代名稱。然而，人終究要老死，要這傑子幹，那除非是本人先去學得長生術！於是他就遣徐福無目的的到東　去求不死之藥，結果，徐福旣不曾回來，當然，同時也就没有求得不死之藥；始皇終於是不免老死了。鞏固的江山，傳到二世，也就免不了喪失丨減亡！</p>
<p>長生術，或人都説是子虚的何嘗能成一回事實，但是，誠則墜，或許並不盡如此。曾記得偶然中，我曾看見一篇所謂彌勒倡云者，有關於修養長生的方法説；</p>
<p>······補被自遮寒，萬事隨緣了！有人駕老拙，老拙還説好；有人打老拙，老拙自睡倒；涕涙在圖上，隨牠自乾了。我自省力氣，他亦無煩　　惱！·····悟得道中理，日月長爲伴。</p>
<p>在當時始皇終不免太笨，連這様修養長生的最好方法，都不便實用；反而要徐福不遠千里的去求無徵信的不死藥，眞忒無聊。</p>
<p>畢竟現在的人是聰明些；他固然懷着始皇心志，却不願學始皇的無意識行動；趕近些，所以就專做彌勒主義的長生術。儘是鄰家割據了我們門房，侵佔了我們聯絡的小星；横堅我們邊廳内室還多，終於用不着抵抗。（我自省氣力，他亦無煩惱！）候到他們住得煩膩的時候，會仍舊歸於我們的；又何嘗就會至於減亡。</p>
<p>（彌勒主義）的長生術，誰還説是渺茫的，無效力的！不然，爲什麽現在我們中國，在專做這門工夫？</p>
<h3>辟穀丹</h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>各報上，在前幾天，都登載着一則驚人的消息，説，歐洲有一位大博士，發現了棉子裏面，含有極富的滋養質。從棉子中提取所含的滋養質，製成藥餅形療飢品，那麽，每人每天用開水呑服這麽小小的二片，肚子裏便可一天不唱空城計。</p>
<p>雖然這一種（辟穀仙丹），尚未見（推銷環球貨品）的大商店陳列在大櫉窗裏，但是在這二十世紀裏，不可思議的事情，甚麽都幹得出來的。所以大家儘不用發愁，在最近的將來，若是金價不再飛漲，最低的限度，（有間階級）裏的（高等華人），準會爲了（經濟時間）起見，把麫包邊丢給姨太太豢養的哈叭狗，而向外洋定購（辟穀仙丹），以代午，晚，以及半夜的三餐。</p>
<p>若是這種（辟穀仙丹），果有一天像（黑麫包）或是（大餅油條）般的普及到民間的話，那麽，我想一切變動是很可觀的。或許中國再閙一次空前未有之水災，而承各國慈眉善目的洋大人，洋太太慷慨解囊時，定不再用（賬麥），而非用（賬丹）不可了。</p>
<p>就以我中國而論，那或許也是怪有趣的，穀賤傷農的經濟學説，不打自倒，因爲大家都做了（不吃飯的人）了。青菜，黄瓜，也不用種，牛羊鷄鴨，也不用養。於是乎你也種棉，我也種棉，穿的吃的，反正多有了着落。</p>
<p>米店，麫坊，都在淘汰之列，飯店，粥店，點心店，以至於　飩担，粢飯攤，也將根本没人光顧。鮮肉莊，鹹肉莊，果然非關門不可，就是小菜塲裏的</p>
<p>臭鳴蛋，東洋魚，也從此休矣。</p>
<p>大家旣做了（水吃飯的人），於是上海的二房東們，又不免一個個笑逐顔開，而立揭（灶間召租）的紅招貼，因爲三房客旣不吃飯，自然没有把煤爐，行灶等吃飯傢伙，安置在灶間的必要了。就是已備這些吃飯傢伙的，或許也會大家實行（慣砂鍋）。</p>
<p>（辟穀丹仙）盛行之後，軍隊（就地徵發）起來，老白姓不用再（供給軍米），行軍的時候，不用再（埋鍋造飯），那倒是很便利的。就是現在大家所惶惶然的（飯碗問題），（麫包問題），也不難迎刃而解。伹不知將來是否會發生（仙丹問題），那可就没有把握。</p>
<h3>採菱人</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>像明鏡一般的池塘，水是這様的澄澈，裏頭的小魚蝦，活潑潑地跳着游着。鄉下人不忍把這大好的水利，投置閒散，便栽些菱秧在裏頭。一到了七八月裏，菱是由着開花而結實，碧澄澄的緣水；簇着田田的菱葉；掩映着許多嫩紅的新菱，那是多麽的美觀！多麽的魅惑着人！江南和浙東的鄉下，池塘是這様的多，所以我們到鄉下去，隨處可以見着菱塘，也隨處可以摘鮮菱吃。　　見到了菱塘，又聯起到採菱人。幼時候讀着筆記和稗官家言，總是這様的説道；（在斜陽將落的時候，紅霞映在菱塘，呈現出千百道紋彩。這時有一絶色女郎，垂着青絲般的髫髮；披着輕綃薄霧的衣服；坐着原漆的浴盤，在菱塘中盪着。伸着纖纖的玉腕，中着紅菱，一邊唱着菱歌道；採菱復採菱，菱多力不勝，人自剥菱吃，那知塘淺深。）</p>
<p>（盡信書，不如無書）。這種活見鬼的描寫，只好騙騙足不出户的書獃子，林黛玉式的美人，那會跑到菱塘裏採菱。在菱塘裏採菱的，雖燃女的也有，只不過是訉頭蓬髮的村姑，那會披着輕綃，那會唱着詩調式的歌曲。我在前年的初秋，到嘉興去玩一趟。那邊有名震浙東的烟雨樓；有晶瑩如鏡的南湖；還有膾炙火口的般　。這様艶麗的地方，菱塘是到處皆有，竟然找不出像上邊所描寫的採菱人來，此外的地方，可想而知。　　我所遇見的採菱人，是這様的一個，也可算俏麗百温柔，值得寫出來的。</p>
<p>便在前年逛南湖的時候，我們坐了小船，到湖邊去玩玩。水中圍着竹籬和繩索，那便是菱塘了。菱梗上正結着綠色無角的南湖菱，引得人　涎欲滴，我的朋友Ｋ君，竟順手牽羊的採他幾隻。那時有一個村姑，正掉着一隻没棚的小船，駛向我們這邊來。看伊十七八歳的年紀，頭髮已經剪掉；赤着雙脚，紫色的大腿，肥健得可愛。穿着一身夏布的衫褲，那面孔也給太陽曬得紫中帶黑。伊見我們在採凌，便告訴這菱塘是伊家的，還呌我們嘗嘗新鮮菱肉的風味。我們故意不去，便掏出了四毛小洋，間伊買一些，伊採了好許多給我們，還告訴我們倘使當天吃不完，在太陽中曬乾了，吃起來一様是鮮甜可愛。這様的採菱人，萬分的天眞，萬分的謙和，已是難得遇着。要像上邊所描寫的，竟是一個採菱的妖怪了。哈！哈！</p>
<h3>星雨</h3>
<p>— 星萊</p>
<p>現在的新女子，正像換　的鳥，史是從舊的束縛跳進新的束縛。</p>
<p>眞正的摩登女子，是能和不良的環境奮鬥打開自已的生路而獨立的人。</p>
<p>最美麗的花朶是不會結果的，最妖艶的女子是没有將來的。</p>
<p>女子的顔色並不是伊的罪惡，可是人們却使它成爲罪惡的源頭。</p>
<p>有人把女職員呌做　花瓶，我看，有許多男職員也很可以呌做（廣漆飯桶）。</p>
<p>最會捧女子的人，也就是最會駡女子的人。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十六回　酸楚襟懷當前還祝福倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍</p>
<p>他心裏想着，這也是眞快，他先是不吃東西，怎麽一會子功夫，就把一碟子鷄蛋糕，吃了一個光。積之看到店夥向他注意，未免有點不好意思，怱怱的喝完了那杯咖啡，會了鈔，就起身出來。那個拉車的張三，把車子放在這裏，人却不見了。積之念他是個賣苦力的人，總得等他來，給他的車錢，於是就站在大門口，徘徊着等他回來。不料等了許久，尚不見他回來，心裏想着，在街邊上　站，也會引着人家疑心，不知道是怎麽一回事，不如在海甸街上，走着繞兩個圈圈，看看海甸街上最近的情形如何，回頭再來，大槪也不晚。他於是信脚所之的走了去。諮也奇怪，他這兩條腿，不必得着他的命令，已經向楊家老姑娘的門口走來。原來的意思，以爲不過走到那條街上看看，到了那條街上以後，他又想着，旣然到了這裏，索興到楊家門口去看看也好。好在那大門口並不見有人，便是走過去，也不妨事，於是他半年來所羞爲重過的楊家門首，竟是走到了。他的初意，或者也以爲是桃花人面，看看空大門而已。及至剛走到那大門口時，恰好男男女女擁出來一大羣人，其中有人穿黄色軍服的，和穿粉紅色長衣的，却是分外地讓他泣意。這就因爲一個是趙自强，一個是楊桂枝。積之突然的看到，不免怔了一怔。因爲桂枝除了身上的那件粉紅色綢褂子而外，頭髮今天也湯着堆雲式的了。在頭髮周圍，就壓着一根紅色絲條。臉上那是不消説，便是濃淡得宜的脂粉。在他左耳邊鬢髮之下，斜着倒插了一朶紅絨花。那活顯着是一個新娘子打扮。（二○一）</p>

<p>（滬南）昨日來源仍旺、計到各帮船頭四十餘號、市况晨初一度猛跌、及午勢稍回緊、本街店胃略健、客帮亦有辦胃、是以形勢頗佳、而行情究因久疲之後、一時殊難抬高、故大局仍屬定中帶緊、市上常帮蘇同帮南港等破粳及陳新客尖等價僅有數分上落、而青角松泗等洋稻、因今市青泗貨乏、故包胃所辦一各餘包、其中除新羊尖外、大都爲松江洋稻、緣洋稻市松江貨較爲稍俏、惟價升參差不一耳、新香粳亦已站定、變元貨稀獨俏、挺秀二三角、廠東新價開七元、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船廿七八號、市形破粳早市又小半角、晚市稍定、而新粳價小一角、新陳羊杜尖·薄粳·團尖·東析粳·客尖·等與昨相仿、白元貨稀價加一角、新埠尖稍帶緊勢、</p>
<p>客秈到銷均旺</p>
<p>昨日客秈市况到銷依然兩旺、到頭有南京火車及長江船運串之湖南米、去路閩帮爲首、其次爲汕頭、本街與寗波亦有應酬、連日到頭極旺·串存漸多、去路雖活、終不及到頭之多故市面已轉人平坦、數日來步步上升之趨勢、已轉變爲疲軟之象、但貨主心思極固、多限於扳售、不肯賤脫、而閩粤去胃可望繼續不斷、故客户雖欲撳小、亦屬難能、昨日售開之高格各米與糙米反見微挺、中次爲一部份客販歡迎、亦不易拉小、祗人心稍爲向下而已、全日售開湖南機米一千五百包、價七元五角半至七元二角半、又砶米七百五十包、價六元六角、又糙米一千七百包、價五元九角、南京廠秈三百包、價七元一角、又糙米一百四十一包、價六元二角三分、嘉興羊尖二百包、價七元四角、中次照降、</p>
<p>近期粉暴跌三分</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上下午開盤後、各月份最近期暴跌、遠則平靜之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥續小一、四角左右、坎拿大跌四五角不等、故開盤後、各月份均大致平疲、生氣甚少、本月份交割之故、多頭回出尤多價亦不振及下午開盤、本月份因祇有半日交易、業外多頭、非了不可、目籌碼不少、致各盤均步步脫手、因此市面亦一落千丈、收盤時竟最低至二元一角五分七厘半、此種新紀錄實屬創見、惟遠期業外套進、遂爲抬住然套頭局面之良好、則又更甚也、結果本月份暴落三分、十月份小二厘半、十一月份反好五厘、十二月份好二厘半、餘未動、</p>

<p>丨小麥見交尚暢丨</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈岑寂不堪之象、以洋麥報價、雖續小二四五角左右不等、但以業中人之見解、以爲洋麥定價與環境、雖過期已有接近之可能、惟目下在粉銷不暢之時、實有買賣均難之象、因此市面遂呈停頓也、結果十一月份好一分、十二月小一分、餘均不動、現麥市面、見交尚暢、特高貨因客户、扳價、似揚高二三分、開瑤灣麥三元九角七分、次至九角、五河麥三元九角三分、泰州麥三元八角四分、高郵麥三元七角七分、次七角三分、露筋麥三元七角六分揚州麥三元六角半、共閱九千二百包</p>
<p>黄豆銷動存氣仍平</p>
<p>黄豆市近來因來源寥落、刦化亦不農、故暫無榮辱、昨成交略多、但均無大胃消化、計廠家辦去大連豆六車、價四元一角七及一角六、又車坊辦去安東豆五百包、價做四元二角二、正陽關豆五百包、價開四元五角半、爲福温兩帮分去、江北新豆成交千一百包、行售四元四角至四元一角、亦乃温福兩帮之去胃、漢口早豆開八百包、價計四元零三分至三元八角三、由本街及厦門温州帮辦去云、</p>
<p>絲茶針眉貢熙價均趨跌</p>
<p>昨日洋莊茶銷仍清、屯溪歙縣遂安等路珍眉、存貨均告竭蹶、婺源北路工色茶、各歐莊雖均有電報發出、但極少回音、惟針眉貢熙等綠茶、英莊恊和同孚等行及白頭行家、均有進胃、全市成交各路綠茶共計、一各六百九十餘箱、其中針眉貢熙兩項、市盤均跌四五元至十元不等云、</p>
<p>糖市隆港青開五百餘包</p>

<p>南北貨新同圓上下檔漲跌各異</p>
<p>同安新桂圓、此次到貨較多、兼值興化圓、中下檔來數更鉅、故昨日開盤中檔行方要跌六七元尚未成交、惟頂大粒爲數不多、已開出者比前升二三元、</p>
<p>疋頭國貨呢絨及時暢銷</p>
<p>國貨呢絨、近三的來日見進步、出品紗毛織物銷路激增、今歲爲國貨年、生意愈見繁盛、章華馬褲呢·法蘭羢·素嗶嘰·花呢·海京之黄路駝絨·西裝套頭花呢·秋大衣呢·導華之眞馬棕袖襄·絲光斜花羽紗等、逐日本客方續有需要、零躉交易均崵、導華絲光羽紗每碼售洋八角五分、眞馬鬃袖襄一元三角半、海京男女色秋裝人衣呢八元半、西裝套頭花呢自六元餘起以至十元頭號雙面黄駱駝絨十二元半、二號八元八角、章華九一八嗶嘰三元二角、軍裝黄呢三元一角半、條子法藍絨四元五角、</p>
<p>五金英馬口鐵軋缺飛俏</p>
<p>自美匯放長後、美貨交易蓬勃而起、因此美馬口鐵之定貨交易、亦有雨後春荀之勢、而反顧英油緊縮、致英馬口鐵之定貨生意、受其影響而减少、最近來華之貨、幾有絶跡之象、而在市流行之貨、亦因之軋缺而趨飛俏、現市九十磅可估十六元二角、比前漲起三角、雙連三十一元五角、亦好起半元、一百磅十七元、好二角、雙連三十五元、好起一元、交易青島烟台福州諸帮均有胃口、惜市貨有供不應銷之嘆、而美貨生意、以此十分興旺、其價缘美匯日長、故尚平和、刻市九十磅售十七元、一百磅十八元、一百磅雙連三十八元五角、聞昨日銷去達千餘箱之多云、</p>

<p>服裝特刋第肆期</p>
<h3>服裝與儀態　仰葊</h3>
<p>衣服爲章身之具，大凡觀察一個人的態度，儀容，第一便注目到服裝上面，我不講理論，先把事實來證明罷：</p>
<p>某銀行招考試用行員，一百二十五人之口試中，合格的三十人，這三十人的態度，都列甲等，而態度列入甲等之原因，大都是從服裝上來。後來吾例問口試員，他説；吾覺得這三十人中，有三分之二以上，都是穿着很樸素很文雅的衣服，尤其是穿着布衣的佔多數。</p>
<p>某公司招考店員，二百人中落第的有一百二十人，這一百二二人中，都是因爲態度不好而遭排斥。這一百二十個不好態度中，走路不好佔百分之二十，説話不好佔百分之十五，面貎不好佔百分之十，而衣服不好的要佔到百分之四十五。</p>
<p>某學校舉行入學考試，一千二百人中錄取了二百個人，這二百個新生的服裝，穿西服的不過百分之十，穿綢緞的约百分之三十五，穿布衣的百分之五十胡蝶女士穿蝴蝶呢之國貨布裝</p>
<p>五，因爲穿綢缎是輕盈是美觀，而穿布衣的是樸素，是文雅，是落落大方，是有儉美和壯美的態度。</p>
<p>普通人看來，穿衣要十分講究，要價值高貴，其實穿衣的眞價舉是在（一）顔色素靜而樸實，（二）不退色，（三）堅韌經穿。我覺得國貨衣料中合此條件的様様都有，要裁西裝，則有章華呢絨。要裁輕盈美妙的衣服，則有美亞綢緞，要裁樸素文雅經穿美觀的服裝，則有鴻新布廠的各種面疋。我們青年，尤其是我們在此國難重重之下的青年，大家要養成穿着布衣的美德。鴻新布疋，恰合不退色樸雅經濟的三個原則。我們並不以胡蝶女士穿了鴻新布，便才以穿着鴻新布衣爲漂亮。不瞞諸位説，我的夫人和我的女孩們，早早穿慣布衣了，早早是鴻新的老主顧了，有一次和黄任之師母當衆表示勸告女太太和小姐們穿着樸素文雅經濟的服裝，居然博得衆女賓的掌聲。這次胡蝶女士贊同此意，也以布衣爲電影界倡導，我想大家當然是十二分的赞同。那麽女學生們的以樸素文雅經濟爲目的的對此布衣運動，當然不言可喻了。</p>
<h3>新裝宜面下珠樓　含凉</h3>
<p>這是形容古代女子的舉止。最有意思的是新裝下面加着宜面二字，新裝和面孔有什麽關係呢？難道新裝可以化醜爲美麽？的確！有許多女子，面孔並不十分倩麗，穿了美化的新裝，就覺是生色不少。我們在曉起，見蓬鬆雲　，睡眠未足的女子，和一塊未經雕琢的璞玉一般。這時候倘然許多同様的女子聚在一起，</p>
<p>也分出誰好誰瓌來了。等到梳掠塗抺以後，便神光煥發，耳目一新了，但還只見半截觀音，要穿了新裝，裊裊婷婷地走下珠樓，那纔整個的成了畫中人。所以這宜面兩字，不得非常有經騐，有藝術。</p>
<p>怎様的新裝纔能宜面呢？第一要（稱身）；第二要（合度）。什麽呌做稱身？譬如長個子的，應當用兩種以上的顔色，分兩截搭配，至少要在長衣上罩一件短袿。依着身子的曲線做，固然是必要的條件，但肥胖的就不相宜了。所以大小長短，要隨人而異。什麽呌做合度呢？譬如時下盛行深色，不問年紀，時令，也隨着用深色，非但不能增美，反而减色。大槪顔色花紋，和人的面孔最有關係，因爲光線色調，和面孔的襯託映射，是相聯的。</p>
<p>現在的女子，又喜歡不施鉛華，僅在頰上一抺臙脂，這是古代的（醉妝），詩詞中常見的（卯飲），就是指醉妝而言。醉妝應當用怎様的新妝？是一個很有趣的問題。請研究新妝的朋友討論罷！我也得貢獻一點意見，就是顔色要淡雅，花紋要古僕，質料或綢或布不妨的，對不對？</p>
<h3>現代女裝之配色法儀翔（續）</h3>
<p>青主色</p>
<p>色中深沉而有雅觀者，莫屬於青，兼有秀氣，令人一見，能生快慰之心，而忘悶厭之念。故西女亦喜備之，然配色宜潔而有光者爲合，青之附色書後；</p>
<p>（附合色）黑米色白</p>
<p>藍屬青即常青</p>
<p>藍爲青之一種，色微淺，略具美術觀，爲其佐色，不與青同，摘抄於下；</p>
<p>（附合色）紅淡藍白</p>
<p>淡藍屬青</p>
<p>淡藍亦藍中艶麗之色，清而無俗，美而有嬌，殊爲藍中之出色，其配以清潔爲宜。</p>
<p>（附合色）銀　深藍　白</p>
<p>青蓮　屬青</p>
<p>青色類中最清原麗之色，首推青蓮，色雅流利。幽嬌媚秀而兼清艶，而無俗，的是青中第一，茲其合配錄下：</p>
<p>（附合色）深青蓮　桃紅　天藍</p>
<p>服裝像包商品的紙　卓呆</p>
<p>人體外面的服裝，好比商品外面包的招牌紙，一方面是保護遽飾這内都的東西，一面還可以表示裏面是什麽商品，是那一家的出品？所以包糖炒栗子的紙，斷不能把牠包月餅；這是一定的。因爲倘使包糖炒栗子的紙，去包了月餅，人家一定不當牠裏面是月餅，總認爲是糖炒栗子了。</p>
<p>人的身體外面的服裝亦然。如果身體是國貨（卽父母以及祖宗都是中國人）那末，最好包在外面的服裝，也用國貨，可以表示裏面是什麽商品？那一家的出品？萬一中國人穿了洋貨服裝，我們看了，對於他的國籍，對於他的父母以及祖宗，一定會發生疑問咧。</p>
<p>所以中國人穿中國服裝，並没有别的意思，不過表明他是中國人罷人。</p>
<p>文明的象徵　二閑</p>
<p>中山先生的民生主義揭　着衣食住行四種要素，爲什麽他把（衣）放在第一位呢？</p>
<p>這個理由是不難明白的。我們試想我們人類的特點是什麽？不消説，就是文明。最足以表現文明者是什麽？我們不能不説就是衣服了。因爲食住行三者並不是人類所專有的需要，而且有些鳥獸簡直還得比一般窮人吃得更好，住得更舒適，這情形我們只消到動物園去看一趟就可以明白，至於（行）的問題，則獸類在深山叢莽中所造成的跡路何嘗比鄉民所走的野徑差些呢？惟有（衣）纔是除了具有文明的人類之外，什麽動物都用不着的東西，這是人類文明的象徵。</p>
<p>我們認　了這一點·就可以從人類的衣服上得到文明的槪念。</p>
<p>先從縱的方面説起。在原始時代，人類用以遮蔽身體的不是樹葉就是草類。及至漁獵時代·人類知道剥了獸皮來禦寒了。從來農業發達，纔出現了圍在腰間的一種粗布，用棉蔴之類織成的。從這粗布進化而爲男女的衣服。後來社會的組織繁複起來，衣服便也適應着人類的心理，增添了各種的花様，例如什麽禮服什麽制服等等。現在物質文明有着多方面的錯綜的發展，在大都市的街頭便看得到形形式式光怪陸離的服裝，有華麗的，也有撲素的，有莊嚴的，也有富於誘惑性的，總之這都是現代文明的反映。我們可以説從樹葉以至一九三三年新裝，這一種衣的進化，也就是文明的進化。　　再從横的方面説罷。人們的服裝往往因其地域，階級或職業的不同而有多少的差異，我們於這中間可以窺見種種文明的因素。都市的</p>
<p>時裝尚奢華，鄉人的衣服尚樸素，這是都市文明和鄉村文明的特徵。現代德意志意大利的褐衫和黑衫表現着歐洲法西斯蒂的文明。蘇聯少年先鋒隊的紅領結則表現着共産主義的文明。哲學家論世界文明有東方和西方的兩大分野，這在服裝上尤其有着顯著的表現。東方的服裝長襟大袖，一件衣服給身材相差不遠的許多人穿，並不見得怎麽不適體，這就表現着東方章華五號馬褲呢織造</p>
<p>文明中籠統和渾沌這些精神。西方的服裝每人依着各自身體的線條裁製，務求其十分切貼這就表現西洋文明中的個人主義和科學精神。　　以上所説是關於衣服的形式方面的話，現在再就衣服的質料方面來説一下。</p>
<p>衣服織物可分爲棉蔴等植物織維及絲，羊毛等動物織維這兩大類。就品質而言，大槪是動物織維的織物比較優良。在文明史上，動物織維的織物也是比較進步的發明，人造絲自然是例外。而動物織維類之中，則絲織品是東方文明的産物，毛織品是西方文明的産物。絲織品性較柔宜於女性服用，毛織品性，宜於較剛男性服用，兩者各有所長。所以在國際通商的起初，幾年中，東方的綢緞曾經大量地輪出到西方諸國去，而爲西洋的太太小姐們所樂用，而西洋的嗶嘰呢絨也大量地輪入到東方來，而爲我們的同胞，尤其是男性們所歡迎。</p>
<p>到了後來，西洋諸國自已也會植桑養蠶織造綢緞，不要來買我們的絲織品了。可是我們同胞因爲已經認識了毛織品的經久和厚暖這些優點的緣故，還是不能不買西洋的嗶嘰呢絨，因此我國單在這方面每年就有了無可彌補的幾千萬元的漏巵。</p>
<p>然而現在新的轉機却到來了。近年來，我國的毛織業有了突飛的進展。該業的代表者章華毛織廠所自紡自織的嗶嘰，企呢，大衣呢，法蘭絨，駱駝絨等，其品質旣和歐美第一流廠家的出品相嫓美，而其價格比舶來品低廉得多，獲得國人熱烈的歡迎。</p>
<h3>我家之秋季服裝費冰瑛</h3>
<p>我們是一個小家庭，夫婦兩人，一個兒子還祗六歲，女兒也祗九歲。淦，每月的收入，是一百六十元，大槪除了一切日常開支，第月的儲蓄，祗有二十四元。（我們四人，都開一儲蓄户，每户每月存洋六元）</p>
<p>我們日常開支，大槪的預算，服裝費，每月統扯是二十元，秋冬的衣服，當然要貴些，所以我們在春夏，便略爲節省一些，以資挹注。</p>
<p>今年的秋季，倒添了不少衣服，全家都有新衣上身，因爲夾衣服，大家都無須再添，所以添置的，都是單衣服。</p>
<p>我自已起初想給芬女都添兩套，後來淦勸我把去年的綢衣改製給好，而他却給我買了一件新流行的糺縵縐回來。我見他自已不曾買什麽，所以也爲他去買了一件天然縐，給他做長袍。芬呢，買了蝴蠂呢與安琪格做兩套西式衣服，榮兒本想買料來裁，後來恰巧瞧見一家百貨公司有現成的九一八嗶嘰的小西裝，而且身材恰合，所以便買了。襯衫不能不添，也買了兩件現成貨，我雖有了糺縵縐旗袍，伹是祇能出外去穿，穿了在家裏做事，是太可惜，故又買了些大同呢做一件旗袍，在家裏日常穿。雖然我自已對於裁製衣服，很有經騐，向來不請教成衣舖，省去裁縫工錢不少，但是祗買了這些衣料，却已化了三十三元五角八分了。我們的家用，都照預算支配，所以不能超過預算，也不妨公開，現在把我們的秋季服裝費賬，附在下面，倘有那一位經濟家指教我們，使我們再可以省儉些，那是很希望的。</p>

<h3>香烟與咖啡與夜</h3>
<p>— 敵碧</p>
<p>要做作家，第一先得學會抽烟。因爲旣是作家，就免不了要寫文章。可是寫文章據説是要靈感的，那末，靈或不來，怎麽辦呢？要是你會抽烟的，那就有辦法，那辦法就是抽烟。在　烟燃着以後，你便可痴呆地望着那一縷縷的烟，裊裊的，於是靈感就來了。靈感一來，你便趕快展開你的原稿紙，於是，寫，寫，不斷地寫。一點鐘過去了，珦點鐘過去了，三點鐘過去了，你的傑作也就完成了。</p>
<p>要是雖然已過了三個鐘點，而你的傑作還未完成的話，那末你可竭咖啡。你知道要自已煮咖啡，是一椿比較费事而且費時間的事情，你也知道你的手邊並没有小厮或者小婢在等待你的驅使，於是你非想出一個喝咖啡的簡易的辦法不可。那簡易的辦法，成者會是預先把咖啡煮好了，冷在那甩　者，要　熱的話，把預先煮好了的安置在熱水中；或者，甚至連預先煮就的手續也歡太過麻煩，你會化七八個銅元買好一塊（咖啡茶），那你只要有一些開水，一冲就可喝了，而且連糖都不用再加。咖啡一喝，就興奮起來了，於是又寫，寫，寫。而且寫，一定要在晚上，並一定要在十二點鐘以後，因爲不到那時你的精神是不會興奮起來的。寫倦了，你就抽烟，喝咖啡；再倦，再抽，再喝。於是四點鐘過去了，五點鐘過去了，六點鐘過去了。在你再不能以烟和咖啡壓抑你的眼花，頭昏，與呵欠的時候，你便把你的　來水筆一去，而跳上床去，往你的夫人的被裏一鑽。</p>
<p>第二個晚上到了，一過十二點鐘，你又照例興奮，又照例寫，你便那様地度過了許多春的夜，夏的夜，科的夜，冬的夜。（啊，作家的夜是多麽奇怪而神秘啊！）你止不住會這様驚嘆着。</p>
<p>哦，作家之夜！</p>
<h3>談重修孔廟</h3>
<p>— 達一</p>
<p>前一月杪，報載某省某將軍，二十七日卯刻，以古樂祀孔，猗歟盛哉！糾糾武夫，尚能尊孔如此，忝在文人，慚悚曷極！因念曲阜孔廟，慘遭兵燹，重修之議，倡自要人，適有倭患，未遑文事，豈天之將喪斯文乎？五教不敷，百禮盡壞。舊居之廟，毁而未修，講頌之聲，輟而莫續。斯誠吾輩宗文仰聖之士，舉莫能逃其責者也！</p>
<p>自魏文重儒尊孔，嘗令魯郡修起舊廟，　朝之間，代有補葺；迨郡縣立學，廟祀遍於天下。至於李唐，遠宗老子，道家者流，於時爲盛。釋老孔子，教術三分，而孔子之權威稍殺矣。雖中經韓李，力排釋老，但儒家之頽勢未弘，孔子之廟祀轉替。陵夷至於五代，各地孔廟之殘破，益不堪問，是則有詩爲證，略可徵言者也。羅隠謁文宣王廟詩云；晚來乘興謁先師，松柏凄凄人不知。九仞蕭墻堆瓦礫，三間茅殿走狐狸。雨淋狀似悲麟泣，露滴還同歎鳳悲。倘使小儒名稍立，豈教吾道受栖遲！此詩寫孔廟荒蕪冷落之狀，足令儒者興嗟，異端失笑。又有代文宣王答一首；</p>
<p>三教之中儒最尊，止戈爲武武尊文。吾今尚自披簑笠，你等何須請典墳。釋氏寳樓侵碧漢，道家宫殿拂青雲。若教顔閔英靈在，終不羞他李老君。此等打油詩，大可入幽默文選。維時孔廟不及佛寺道觀之盛，固賴此詩爲證也。</p>
<p>又，馮道典南陽，郡中宣聖廟壞，有酒户十餘輩投狀乞修，道未及判，有幕客題狀後云；</p>
<p>槐影參差覆杏壇，儒門子弟盡高官。却教酒户重修廟，覓我慚惶也不難。道遽罷酒户之請，出已俸重修。幕客此舉，正自幽默，馮道亦可謂知趣者矣。長樂老自謂與孔子同壽，孔子有靈，其亦哂而許之乎？</p>
<p>更有李相穀者，嘗爲陳州防禦，謁夫子廟，見像在破屋中，歎息久之。伶人李花開趨進，獻口號云；</p>
<p>破落三間屋，蕭條一旅人。</p>
<p>不知負何事，生死厄於陳。</p>
<p>相穀遽出俸修之。嘗考孔子一生行事，若與優人女樂有仇，焉知千有餘年以後，其陳州廟祀，絶而復繼，尚賴優伶口齒之惠乎？</p>
<p>乃者黄河嘗清，海波不揚。（偃却繩其祖，修來未喪斯，）已見詩人歌詠。庶幾曲阜孔廟，復其壯觀，全國學宫，亦得輪奂一新矣乎？顔閔有靈，共奏壁中之絲竹；程朱可再，同揚泗水之波瀾。海澨腐儒，不勝跂祝。</p>
<h3>談現代中國的婦女</h3>
<p>— 周楞伽</p>
<p>雖然自已是青年男人裏面的一個，但對婦女問題，却也頗爲關心。這關心，倒不是像那些小白臉的文化代表者一様，有着另外一種目的。而是因爲從整個社會問題上觀察，現代中國的婦女問題，實在是個值得研究的問題。</p>
<p>只要稍微明瞭一些國際現勢的人，大槪都知道，現在世界各國的政治舞臺上，有不少女性在那裏活動。她們有的做議員，有的做大使，有的竟至於入閣。而在蘇俄，則女性幾乎和男性一様地在參加生産事業。這些都證明女性的能力並不低於男性，或許還要超過。</p>
<p>然而，回過頭來瞧一瞧我們中國現在的那些女性們，又是怎様呢？不幸得很！恕我説一句不敬的話，實在很少能有幾個使人瞧得上眼的，縱使她們能把兩條眉毛畫得細而且長，一個面孔塗得白中透紅，身上的衣服穿得花花綠綠，脚下的鞋跟高起三寸。</p>
<p>回想三一八執政府門前　願，中了槍彈而用圍巾捫住創口，一些都不露出張皇的神色來，使日文北京週報社長藤原都驚歎爲（表示中國復興的新機運）的女學生。（見語絲七十三期豈明先生新中國的女子文）以及革命軍從韶關誓師北伐時，在政治部裏的女性那種轟轟烈烈不可一世的氣慨。再瞧瞧現在的所謂摩登女性，在家裏是待沽的商品，在社會上是花瓶，嫁了人是丈夫的附庸的情形。殊使人有恍如隔世之感。</p>
<p>便是婦女團體和關於婦女的刋物，現在也没有從前那様興盛。卽以上海而論，國難前還有一個有等於無的婦女協會，國難後便改爲婦女救濟會，而這婦女救濟會的本身，也好像正待救濟似的，不久便無影無踪了。至於刋物，則（婦女雜誌旣被炸毁，（新女性）又因老　聲明今後婦女問題將改　實際而壽終（内寢）；現在碩果僅存的雖然還有幾種，但都没有多大意思　　時代把過去的一切有希望的女性淘汰了，而新的女性又只知道燙髮　　，塗脂抺粉。難道中國的婦女們，便將永遠沉淪下去了嗎？</p>
<p>看了（母性之光），又看了自由談上林語堂涂懋庸兩先生的文章，心有所感，不知不覺提起肇來寫了這麽一些。在此，我熱忱地期待着中國女性的覺醒。</p>
<h3>三等車中（續）</h3>
<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>人一往北方走，就會覺得自已是一刻一刻地變老了。尤其是對於離開廣東不久的我，見過了南國的鄉村，吃慣了南國的食物，呼吸慣了南國的空氣以後，這感覺是特别銳敏的。南國的那種明綠的榕樹，在這里是看不見的了。這里的一切景物都給罩上了古老，沉重的暗影，找不出一點南方的經快活潑的顔色。津浦路沿途的車站是值得注意的。每個大站都有牠自已的獨特的様式，雖然同是西洋風的舊建築物，但没有兩個是相同的，有些竟使人聯想到了教堂。</p>
<p>車上的生活是很沉悶的，單調的。乘客多的時候還可以看見一些特别的事情。去年那一次旅行裏我就看見了不少。譬如一個老婦因爲没有車票就被趕出車廂，在那扶梯邊的走廊上蹲踞着，讓夜晚的冷風吹打。又如一個土匪上車來捉一個替人送欵的忠厚的鄉民，那鄉民幾乎被他拖了下車，却給一個車警來解救了，土匪就在火車駛行的當兒跳了下去　　這一次我却什麽也看不見，也聽不見一　值得注意的談話。到了站乘客上下，或者向小販買食物，這是最平常的事情。兩角錢一隻燒　，一角錢好幾個梨子，這是最受人歡迎的食物。時候過得很慢，但也很平瀅地過去了。夜晚我幸運地睡了一個好覺，第二天早晨醒起來時，火車已經過了濟南。</p>
<p>窗外的北方的平原是有些可愛的，雖然樹木少，雖然只有一點秃的山，但也可以給人引起另一種感覺。沉着，樸實，没有一點誇張，没有一點掩飾，北方的景物就像北方的人，他們沈默地負起生活的擔子，堅忍地和困難戰鬥着，直到死不發出一聲呌喚。</p>
<p>在山東境内的某一個車站旁邊，人門搭了草篷在那里開（追悼大會。）會已經開過了，剩下來對聯，供桌和遺像，據説被追悼的是前次刦車中被害的車警。原來兩個多星期以前津浦車曾經在這附近給土匪搶刦過一次。</p>
<p>下午五點多鐘火車到了天津東站。我在上海中國旅行社買票時曾爲了（東站）和（總站）的問題把那賣票員麻煩了好一會兒，那里只有到天津東站的車票，我當時却以爲火車先到（東站）後到（總站）現在纔知道我的記憶的錯誤了。（完）</p>
<h3>熱情的小孩（三）</h3>
<p>— 哥茫與賽作鑄瑛譯</p>
<p>星期日一早起，他便使得他的姑母淘氣。他不要那用舊了的領子；他要那比較高的，他行第一次領聖禮（Premicreommunion）時，她買給他的那條領子。他要配上那條藍色的有着小花點的領帶。他在客廳的穿衣鏡裏照着：（小畜生，你看看；這已經夠漂亮了呢。）他的姑母臉上浮着一個病人的蒼白的微笑給他繫上領結。</p>
<p>他戰慄着動身走了。</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>他在她身旁，坐在一條仄小的木凳上，和兩位老年人一同乘着敝篷馬車，向一個故寧裡的森林駛去，如登仙境。也採集一些巴旦杏的花房，用來搔弄他的頸根。他陶醉在她身上那種不知名的芳香裡，玩着她的手鐲，那金製的蛇形手鐲。馬車駛出基约姆森林之後，便是一個新的境界，這比他所夢想的一切境界更美，就像她那美麗的眼光可以變更一切似的。突然，他們深入到一個明澈的清凉界了。他們的頭上佈着一片綠色透明的薄紗，像雲那麽輕；這兒，　亟行廊柱之間，是片蒼白的秋牡丹的湖，稍遠一點是一片藍色的風信子的湖。他發見了樹林裡的風信子，他發見了森林。他們下了車；她爲了他裝作孩子般跑着；（啊···啊···牝鹿在那兒？牠在樹林裡面。）</p>
<p>她是被春天的鳥唱閙醒的（睡林的美人（Belleaubosdormant）；她是嘲笑麥蘭（Merlin）的威威安（Viviane）；她是那在牧鹿之羣中尋出來的貞勒威爾，德，勃拉邦（Cenevievedobrabant).</p>
<p>但卡湃爾先生有點畏寒，於是那興忽怱地在樹枝間跟着他倆走的卡湃爾夫人便呌喚他倆；（喂！喂！）他倆跑來了，快樂得滿臉通紅。（教母，這例是那使我復活的媚人的王子。）他們穿過一些回復了生氣的牧塲，在斜腸影裏駛車歸來。小孩的心上充滿了快樂，這種快樂太美麗了，他不十分了然它的來源。她含笑説着閒話，好像因爲有他作伴感着幸福似的，而這便使他滿足了。</p>
<p>五點鐘，大家回到屋裏的時候，來了一個戴手套的，講究禮貎的青年客人。他坐着，好像被一個意外的出現，弄得有點手足失措似的。這是海商仲買人卡湃爾先生的繼任者的第一書記，卡湃爾先生認識他的時候還祇這様高。他低下眼睛，臉紅紅的。在一旁注視着他的羅哲，心裏覺得很不舒服，當她和他説話時，他便打斷他，插嘴進去，現得無禮。大家談着港裏輪船的進出，商會的事情，但他不聽。當這青年動身走了，卡湃爾夫人對白德小姐打趣的問道；（你覺得這孩子怎様，嚇？）她做了一個輕怱的手勢，（他不使我覺得怎様，他的様子太蠢了。）羅哲聽了這話便大大的寛了心。</p>
<p>在等待着晚飯時候，大家玩着（鴿飛）（pigeon丨vote）的游戲，丨因爲羅哲很難得的當在這裏消遣一晚，丨於是他兩眼亮晶晶的，發現一些連他自已都料不到會有的機智和頑皮舉動，這一切，他在家裡和兩位老人相處時，是從來没有使用過的。（他眞滑稽，這個羅哲，這是一個羅哲，彭唐（Rogerbontemps法國典型的滑稽人物）！）卡湃爾夫人一面忙着，一面這様説；而那老頭兒却在他那雪白的鬚鬚裏微笑着，好像古道照人的内斯妥（Nestor）一様。</p>

<h3>最新眞空管２Ｂ６雙重三極管</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>不久以前，收音機内末级餘出的眞空管；僅有三極管用作Ａ類放大，Ａ類放大的特點，能得較優的音質，伹效率不免減弱；　後五極强力管問世，其特長即能輪出較　的電力，所以　極低的外來信號電壓，亦能得宏大的音量，然其最大缺點，爲易於失眞；要求宏大的音量而不使失眞，惟有採用最新式的２Ｂ６眞空管，此管的設計目的，即以三極用作Ａ類放大而能有極强的輸出電力　　此眞空管的線路，如圖所示，管内含有兩個三極管，故名雙重三極管（Dupioxtriode)，僅有一熱絲極（Ｈealer），供給兩個分離的陰極，輸出部的棚極在管内與輸入部的陰極直接相連，管内爲　號電壓所振激的三極，謂之輸入部，饋至擴聲器的三極，謂之輸出部。</p>
<p>細察綫路，可知輸入部的栅電位，得自ＲＯ上的電壓降，此輸入部的穏定屏電流爲３ＭＡ，栅位電阻ＲＯ８０００obms，所以穏定的直流棚電位爲２４VOLTS,注意此電阻的兩端，並無旁路電容器跨接，更須注意輸入棚的電位較負於陰極，所以輸入部的棚極，並不消耗電力　　輸出陰極的自位電阻（Seifbiasingresister)爲５４０ohms,屏路直流爲４０ma，所以Ｒ１的電壓降爲２１５，在輸入棚極未接受外來訊號電壓時，輸出棚因與輸入陰相連，故其確實的電位，當爲Ｒ０及Ｒ１上電壓的差數，即十２５Ｖ，此極小的正電位，使輸出棚路内約有ma的電流，當訊號電壓傳至輸入部時，交流電壓加諸輸出棚極，使其電位搖動，易正或變負，此棚平時僅有極小的正電位，在外來電波正半週時，其正電位增高，消耗電力亦增大，即需要的棚流更多，所以此棚電力的變化，全爲輸入部的作用自動控制，注意此眞空管在無訊號時所取的直流電力，較最大振激時所需要者爲大，故爲Ａ類放大式。</p>
<p>更有最特殊的情形、雖輸入棚的電位爲２４Ｖ即最高值３５Ｖ的信號電壓，加諸其上，此棚仍不能引去電流，因Ｒ０上無傍路電容器連接，故屏流變動時，交流電壓産生於Ｒ０，爲２１Ｖ，所以確實加於輸入部的電壓最高值爲３５２１１４Ｖ，合之有效值，僅１０Ｖ，此種情形，稱之减生作用（Degeneration）减生作用並不存在於輸出部，因Ｒ１有２５mf的旁路電容器連接，足能維持Ｒ１兩端間的電壓，穏定不變，</p>
<p>２Ｂ６特性表如一；</p>
<p>熱絲極電壓２５Ｖ</p>
<p>熱絲電流２２５ＡＭＰ</p>
<p>輸入部　輸出部</p>
<p>屏電壓　２５０Ｖ屏電壓２５０</p>
<p>棚電壓　２４Ｖ棚電壓十２５</p>
<p>屏電流　３ma屏電流４0ma</p>

<h3>高週波綫圈配合法</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>收音機加了高週波放大之後，必須採用同軸電容器，纔能得到調節的便利。否則逐級調節，實在不勝其煩。　　我們知道，在多級高週波放大線路</p>
<p>内，如果採用同軸調節，不僅電容器的容量彼此不能有毫厘之差，就是每個高週波變壓器的磁感量，也須完全相同，纔能得到最完美的效果。</p>
<p>以前，大家都以爲此類高週波線圈，配合是很費手續的，因此，便非購置現成的不可。其實自已製造和配合，也並不是一件困難的事情。</p>
<p>先依照附表任意選繞高週波放大線圈一枚。次將線圈並接在·０００２mfd固定電容器上。再將線圈與再生式收音機的棚路線圈作寛交連，（Loosecoupling)同時並旋轉Ｃ２，俟聽筒内發生響聲或電表指針恰能跞動時爲止。（爲求配合進一步之準確計，調節完畢後，須再將高週波線圈由遠移近，如仍有上述現象發生，即證明彼此確已諧振。　　第二線圈大小，長短······等均與第一綫圈同，（能多繞半圈，亦佳）配合法，亦如上述。配合時Ｃ１Ｃ２Ｃ３及收音機其他任何部份均不可有絲毫移動，祗准將第二綫圈之頭尾數圈加以分開或並緊，俟聽筒或電表有變化時，即證明第一綫圈與第二綫圈之磁感量相等。（綫圈配合後最好塗以石蠟以免日久因移動而變更磁感量）</p>
<p>第三第四····綫圈之配合法，仍同上述，茲不贅。</p>

<h3>常識</h3>
<p>— 黄鑑村</p>
<p>（十五）礦石收音機（一）</p>
<p>（一）槪説；（）全國礦石化！）這是日本用來號召民衆，普及廣播的口號。誠然，在世界各處都閙着經濟恐慌的今日，像那様價昻的眞空管收音機，决不是一般的民衆所購得起的；反之，礦石收音機爲價低廉，且構造和管理均極簡易，民衆雖窮，區區幾角錢的收音機，未始不能家購户置。這就是彼邦所以高呼着（全國礦石化）的用意。他山之石，可以攻錯，我們亦未始不能效法，來把廣播無綫電普及給我們的民衆。在這裏，礦石收音機是值得我們注意的。</p>
<p>（二）礦石檢器的種類；用來做檢波的礦石目下有人造的結晶品，其靈敏度優而動作安定者爲　化炭素，矽素，硫化</p>
<p>鋅，氧化鋅等。至於用自然産的礦石爲檢皮器而靈敏度優秀者，亦不在少數，如紅鋅礦，銳錐礦，方鉛礦等是，礦石檢波器又可由其構造而分成試探式礦石與固定式礦石兩種。</p>
<p>（Ｉ）試探式礦石；如圖（一）所示，在礦石皿上裝一鐵針，使和礦石相接觸，而尋覓其靈敏　度最優之點。這種試探式礦石雖可以得到好的靈敏度，但是稍一震動，就立刻變更鐵針和礦石的接觸點，使靈敏度低下，這是試探式礦石所使人不能滿意之點，但其價值是比較低廉的。</p>
<p>（２）固定工礦石；如圖（二）所示，在一小塊礦石之上裝一螺旋鐵綫，而將礦石靈敏度最優之點固定着。這種礦石如受打擊過甚，則失其靈敏。靈敏度一旦失去，則不易恢復，故務須小心處置，切勿使受打擊。又如遇陰天有雷電接近時，固定式礦石往往受電氣的衝擊，而失其靈敏度。故當落雷時，切勿收聽播音。</p>

<h3>蜂窩綫圈繞法</h3>
<p>— 仁榮</p>
<p>經騐告訴我們，許多綫圈式中要推蜂窩式綫圈（Bobineeuniddahielles）爲最經濟了，不論地位與用材都合着經濟的條件。其繞法先備木軸一段，直徑約四至六ＣＭ,高亦相仿，上下端沿邊各分插廿四只插釘，約合角度十四度一釘，（圖甲爲平視圖乙爲軸邊）起繞在上排下排没有關係，由某一排至另一排跳過之釘數，呌隔步（Pasodenooulment)依繞的習慣，由雙數隔步，至單數隔步此須視上邊或下邊共插若干釘之半數。廿四釘之半十二釘即雙數隔步。而單數隔步即折半加一等於十三，如圖乙繞綫２４丨１３丨１丨１４丨２丨１５丨３丨１６丨４丨１７丨５丨１８丨６丨１９丨７丨２０丨８丨２１丨９丨２２丨１０２３丨１１丨２４丨１２丨１丨１３丨····照此繞下，自下邊２４丨１３，又自１３丨１名一週（Spire），上下四十八釘上均經繞綫一次呌一層（Coudbe），繞畢用綫攀住，塗以膠汁，待乾把釘拔去裝支持架上即成，還有幾個繞法待後再説。（仁榮註，本文簡譯法文書，故譯名仍註法文，以存其眞。）</p>
<h3>短波發射機之調準法及其步驟（續）</h3>
<p>— 羅靜</p>
<p>至平差進行的方法則爲；</p>
<p>（Ａ）於振盪器發生振盪後，始燃點擴大器燈絲及加上栅極電壓。惟屏電壓須待平差終了後，始行加上。</p>
<p>（Ｂ）用一個小燈泡，將他連於兩綫圈，并近於屏極線路接屏之一方。然後稍轉屏極電容器，使小燈泡略略發亮，發亮之後，即略增平差電容器ＣＮ之度數，同時又將屏極電容器再事增加，使小燈泡更亮。循此經數次之進行，直至小燈泡由稍亮，大亮，而不亮時，則此時之平差電容器約有百分之十至二十尚少於眞正之平差電容量。倘再將兩電容器如法漸次增加，則至相富度數時，小燈泡又亮，此時則約在眞正平差電容量百分之十至二十。若我們將平差電容器即位於此兩者的度數之間，於是擴大器的平差工作便算完成了。</p>
<p>（Ｃ）不過爲求燈明我們的平差是否可靠，所以還須探得一種明確的標幟。其法可依照下述兩點做去；（甲）已確定之平差電容器的度數不必變動，只將屏極電容器轉動，可看前一級屏　米厘安培表的指針是否因此而跳動；若是不會因此而跳動，這便已經證明那是可靠的了。（乙）若棚極線路中置有米厘表的，也是同様的情形，而以表中指針之跳動與否來判斷平差之成功與失敗的標準。　　調準擴大器每一單級的方法旣如上述，則只要每級求得平差後，便可加上屏電壓，而略事調節屏極綫路，就可以開始次一级的工作。如是順序的下去以至未級，便是整個發射機中的擴大部份完成了他自身的調準的目的。</p>
<p>（４）擴大器旣經調準，然後交付天線，調準天線電路。其法與單振盪式者中相同。</p>
<p>（５）最末一步手續，是校騐各級的平差是否可靠？所以在各級及天線電路都調準後，只須將勵振器之屏極開關離去，則各級屏極之米厘安培表，其記數，必須全然跌至零位。若某一級中未跌至零位，則此級必然有自振盪之發生；而我們也必須仔細地再將他好好的重新平差。（完）</p>
<h3>經濟的二燈收音機</h3>
<p>— 柯榮炎</p>
<p>我們知道有許多收音機的式子，因爲利用特殊的連結法，可以用少數的眞空管，得到較高的效力，如再生式，來復式等，都是效力很好的線路，這裏所説的也是經濟强力的一種，他的原理是用礦石作檢波，一方面用一個眞空管發生振盪來助他放大，也就是外差式，裝置得好時，比普通的三管機效力大，下面就是這種收音機的線路；</p>
<p>上圖Ｌ１５０圈，在廿圈或十五圈處　一頭，Ｌ２６０圈，Ｌ３４８圈，ＣＩ和Ｃ２可以用０００４６ＭＦＤ的可變電容器，Ｔ１和Ｌ２都是３５比一的低週波變壓器，V１如用Ａ１０９那末Ｖ２可以用Ｂ１０５如用１９９則Ｖ２可以用１２０，不過用０９９時Ｌ３應當比用Ａ１０９時多些大槪是五十幾圈三個　圈都繞成蛛綱式。在上辕Ｘ處有時也可裝一隻栅電阻和電容器全機裝好後可以一試。</p>
<p>這種收音機用電省，所以電源可以用電池供給，音質很清亮，小小二管機可用一隻小喇叭放音，讀者不妨一試。不過據作者試騐，Ｖ１和Ｖ２是用Ａ１０９和Ｂ１０５較好。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<p>暧昧的语言　遠志</p>
<p>在　文上，幾個字，形式聲音不同而意義相同，呌做Synonym，若聲音相同而形式意義不同，則　Parcmvm。常聽話·讀書·作文的時候·後者是不免陷人於　誤的。</p>
<p>中國文字上的（假借），也是討厭的車西，性質和Parcnvm相當，不過這是形同而意義異罷了。那太來的Paicmvm,在中文倒是不成問題的；</p>
<p>但是古今中外最成爲問題的，是音同形同而涵義不定的許多字。玄學哲學上閙得烏烟瘴氣的什麽（道），什麽（體），什麽（絶對的一），固然使人們不知所云。便是現在的許多極普通的字眼，意義何嘗明白？</p>
<p>舉幾個例來看看罷；</p>
<p>（社會主義）這一個名詞，是盡人皆知的了，但是牠的定義，本來就不確定，吸看牠所包羅的，有時説只限於共産主義，有時説無政府主義，三民主義·····；等等也在内，界限已不清楚。到了今年，有一種刋物，竟把法西主義也稱做社會主義了。從此以後，我　遇見一個自稱（社會主義者）的人，就很難知道他是斯丹林派呢。還是希特　派，而猜疑　字了。</p>
<p>又如另一個家諭户曉的名詞；（革命）意義也日益暧昧起來。這羣人自稱，（革命），殺另一羣人，另一羣人也自稱（革命），殺這一羣人，一羣又一羣，革命又革命，愈革愈複雜，使我們見了自稱（革命者）的人，也莫名其妙了。</p>
<p>在這種情形之下，做事那得不彷徨，説話又那得不含糊呢？</p>
<p>法國的文豪服爾泰（Ｖcitaire）曾經説過；（你若願意同我談話，先立下你所用的字眼的定義來！）先前我頗覺他的話過於（像煞有介事），直到了現在，才知道這確是甘苦之談，定義不明的談話，確　討厭而且危險的，現在有許多學術上的論爭，常常是兩方站在同一立塲，使用同一武器，爲了同一目的，而此攻彼擊，閙得落花流水，而結果還是莫明其妙。這也是大家不先把所使用的詞句的定義去清之故。</p>
<p>要反一個名詞的定義弄明白，當然是不難的，然而當今的人，却不願你弄明白，故意要弄得昧，矛盾。這是一種戰術，放烟幕彈。</p>
<p>楯是金的還是銀的呢？原呈兩面一看就明白的，但是人們只許你看正面。象是像牆壁的還是像木棍的呢？雖是瞎子，只要通身一摸，也會明白的，但是人們只許你摸　皮。</p>
<p>於Paronym之外，還有一種　　语（Ａmbiguity)，也是討厭的東西。關於這有個著名的傳説；</p>
<p>古代希臘的亞坡羅神祠，是非常神靈的所在，到此去祈求預言的人，常絡繹不絶。有一次，吕底亞的國王克婁蘇想同波斯開戰，也到那里去預卜勝負，神果然降子預言説是；（一大國當亡）。克婁蘇大喜，以爲波斯必亡，遂宣戰。戰爭的結　，神的預言果然應了然而滅亡的帝國。却不是波斯而是克婁蘇自已的吕底亞。</p>
<p>目前中國所　傳的（外交轉變），也是亞坡羅式的讐關語。將轉變到那一方面，我們是無從預料的，倘有人因此而欣然，或戚然，未免過早。</p>

<h3>花歟花瓶座子歟華</h3>
<p>誰都知道，花瓶是養花的，花瓶座子是安置花瓶的。花摘下了不插在瓶裏，就要缺乏生氣，花瓶没有座子也要减色不少。這三件東西是有連帶關係的，都是給人們玩賞的。</p>
<p>現在一般摧殘女子職業的人，都把（花瓶）這一個名字，作爲機關女職員的别號；意思是毫不客氣的説；機關裏的女職員簡直不是去辦事，而是去供在那裏做裝飾品，給人欣賞的。固然，這是母用諱言的，機關裏的女職員，當然不能説絶對没有（花瓶）這種人存在裏面。不過總不能這様的武斷説凡是機關裏的女職員都是（花瓶），吾因爲想到機關裏去做事，不知受了多少親友們的冷嘲熱諷，説吾是不是也想去做（花瓶）。唉，吾自已雖深知道吾不會去做（花瓶），而且也没有資格去做（花瓶）的，可是吾的出路究竟受了很大的影響。吾因之想到女子職業解放前途的危險而感到莫大的憤怒。造這名字的人眞太把女同胞侮辱了！無論如何，吾們决不能承認（機關女職員都是花瓶）的一句話。那些打扮得妖妖艶艶而去坐在辦公室内的女職員就算他們是（花瓶），那吾倒要詰問，那些打扮得油頭滑腦，塗雪花，洒香水的西裝少年又是些什麽呢？女職員打扮了是給人們欣賞的，男職員的打扮難道是他們公事上所需要的嗎？女職員打扮了就要加上一個（花瓶）的綽號，男職員打扮了就默默不作一聲，天下决没有這種便宜的道理。吾以這種傢伙，也應當給他們一種名稱，和那種女職員同其待遇。吾曾仔細的留意過，男子的打扮差不多是跟着女子走的，就是；那種（花瓶）多，那裏這男子也就多。你可看出，没有（花瓶）的地方，那男職員的打扮就要樸質或落拓得多，一有了（花瓶）他們就會立刻的改頭換面起來的。照這様看來，他們不是明明要在外貎上用功夫以取悅於（花瓶）嗎？他們過份的整裝整容的坐在那裏，不也是要使（花瓶）去欣賞他們嗎？他們的跑進辦公室，不是要和所謂（花瓶）也者的女職員相映成趣嗎？他們不也是一様成了辦公室裏的裝飾品嗎？所以他們和（花瓶）實在是有密切的關係的。困之給吾想到了插在花瓶懷裏的花和蹈在花瓶脚下的座子，與其名他們爲假花，還是名他們花瓶座子來得適當，這吾到要請大家起來討論一下了。</p>

<h3>A Plundering of the Changping Ming Tombs is Undertaken</h3>
<p>The Authorities Order Strict Defense by All Armies</p>
<p>Order Restored in the Tangshan Area</p>
<p>Japanese Troops from Huairou to Withdraw to Miyun Shortly</p>
<p>(Beiping) Remnants of Fang Ji's troops fled to Dushikou and Yanqing. Local authorities have ordered Pang's army and Guan Linzheng's troops to defend against them. The bulk of Fang's forces, three regiments under Wang Zhongfu, surrendered mostly in the Tangshan area. Currently, there is no trace of Fang Ji's troops in Baimiao and Nanzhuangying, about 30 miles from Tangshan. The Japanese Eighth Division's Fifth Regiment, with over two hundred soldiers stationed in Huairou City, are expected to withdraw to Miyun within two to three days. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Ji's two units were completely routed yesterday morning, scattering towards Gaoliying, passing through Erdaoguan northwards, and fleeing back to Dushikou via Taoyukou. Fang Ji met with his forces in Dongxi Xincheng last night, deciding to flee into the Chahar territory. Today, there are no bandit troops south of Jiuduhe. Fang Ji's remnants, numbering five to six hundred, infiltrated the Thirteen Ming Tombs area in Changping County last night. This morning, the National Army dispatched troops to suppress them, a problem easily resolved. Last night, only the National Army's guard line fired a few rifle shots as a warning; there were no other disturbances. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Tangshan reports that villagers who fled to Fenshuiling returned this afternoon, reporting that Fang's First Army had crossed Fenshuiling and retreated to the vicinity of Erdaoguan, gathering along the line north of the Great Wall. Troops are also gradually withdrawing from Jiuduhe and the Thirteen Tombs area within Changping County. A battalion of the 129th Division of Wan's Army stationed in Xiaotangshan, Changping, advanced towards Xiazhuang this morning after Fang's forces were cleared from Datangshan and Xingshou. The commander of the Third Battalion, Wang Lihuan, is stationed in Tangshan City, restoring local order. Shops and businesses within the town are operating as usual. Liu Zhili, the chief of the Second District of Tangshan, and Zhou Shusen, the chief of the Public Security Bureau, are consulting with the stationed troops to implement rural pacification and strictly investigate dispersed soldiers to maintain security. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Fang's troops occupied the Ming Tombs, approximately two thousand more troops from Fang's command and three thousand from Ji's command, along with about four hundred from Zhan Tao, successively arrived at Laojuntang, eighteen miles from Changping. The National Army assumed an encirclement posture and made contact on the 29th. Fang Ji's headquarters are located in Laojuntang, with an attempted night raid on Nankou in Changping planned for the night of the 29th. After noon on the 29th, a Japanese plane arrived in Changping and dropped a bomb. Changping is under special curfew tonight. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fang's Troops Attack Nankou, Repelled</h3>
<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Nankou states that defenses at Nankou are solid. Over four hundred of Fang Ji's troops reached the Thirteen Tombs. This morning, they engaged in fierce fighting for four hours with the guard unit of the Twelfth Regiment of our Xiaohongmen forces. Ji's forces were unable to hold their ground and retreated north. Our Eleventh Regiment plans to send troops tonight to eliminate Fang Ji's forces in the Thirteen Tombs area. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Fang Ji's mixed troops fled west from Tangshan on the 28th, the Second Division's brigade was ordered to be on high alert. On the night of the 18th, Fang Ji's troops camped at Shanhounanzhuang and Beizhuang. At dawn today, a company of the Zhong Zuyin Regiment of Luo's brigade, guarding the Ming Tombs' Xiaohongmen, discovered that a battalion of Fang's infantry was planning to attack Nankou. The company opened fire head-on. Around 10 AM, Fang's forces reinforced with another battalion. Regiment Commander Zhong received the report and personally went to the front lines to command. The battle was still raging at noon. Around 1 PM in the afternoon, the gunfire stopped, and the enemy seemed to be retreating. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fang Ji's Troops Flee into Changping Territory</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military dispatch: After the remnants of Fang Ji's troops north of Gaoliying fled westward yesterday afternoon, remnants of Ji and Fang's forces are still appearing in the mountainous area south of Erdaoguan and north of Datangshan and Xiaotangshan. However, they are lacking complete weaponry and their morale is low, so they have not taken any significant action. In addition, a small unit of several dozen men fled into the Changping territory near the Ming Tombs and were surrounded and eliminated by the stationed troops. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Tangshan states that after Fang Ji's troops retreated from the Nanzhuangying area on the 28th, most of them fled along the northern mountains from Daxinfeng and Hejiaying towards the Thirteen Tombs in the northwest. Fang Ji himself led a portion of his forces and stationed them at Xincun, with outposts reaching the Ming Tombs area. Hundreds of Fang Ji's remnants are lingering in the chaotic mountains within Tangshan and have not left. Fang Ji's goal is still to reach eastern Chahar or southern Zhangjiakou, but he is trapped in an encirclement and has not yet escaped the Changping territory. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Troops from Niulanshan Have Withdrawn</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Fifth Regiment of the Japanese Army stationed in Niulanshan, with approximately two hundred soldiers, withdrew towards Huairou this morning. Our security forces and the Public Security Bureau police have taken over the area. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When the Japanese army entered the Pingbei war zone and Fang Ji's troops fled to the vicinity of Gaoliying, the Ping military authorities repeatedly telegraphed Huang Fu to negotiate with the Japanese side. Huang recently telegraphed Ping, stating that he had contacted Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi Akira several times. The Japanese side agreed that once Fang Ji's military situation came to an end, they would withdraw all troops from Huairou, Ningyun, and Niulanshan in Pingbei back to their original garrison locations. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Track and Bomb Fang's Troops</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, three Japanese planes tracked and bombed Fang's troops.

<h3>Newly Formed Security Forces Blocked in Luanzhou, Forced to Return</h3>
<p>Will Continue Eastward After Negotiations</p>
<p>Japanese Claim Old Mice Attack Changli</p>
<p>Changli Residents in Utter Panic</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 1,500-strong Second Team of the Special Security Forces of the War Zone, after completing their training with provincial funds, were heading to eastern Luanzhou on the morning of the 28th, travelling via three trains from Tianjin, to clear out bandit groups like Old Mouse's troops in Funing and its surrounding area. Upon arrival in Luanzhou at noon, a unit of Japanese soldiers boarded the train for inspection. Because the security team was carrying mortars and machine guns, the Japanese soldiers believed that the security team was only allowed to carry rifles and had no need for machine guns. Considering this a violation of the armistice agreement without Japanese approval, they confiscated all the machine guns and mortars and ordered the security team to return to Tianjin, pending a successful negotiation. Therefore, the entire team has returned to Tianjin this morning. After the reception committee negotiated with Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in Ping, the confiscated weapons were returned. The security team will depart from Tianjin again either this morning or tomorrow, but the returned equipment can no longer be carried. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong reported the incident of the Japanese army rejecting the security team from entering eastern Luanzhou to Pingfang today. The 2,000-strong security team that the provincial government sent to eastern Luanzhou to suppress bandits departed via three trains. Upon arrival at Luanxian Station, the Japanese Railway Line Area Commander and the garrison refused passage, using the excuse of carrying heavy weapons without orders. Unable to advance eastward, the security team leader returned on the same train that night. The first train returned to Tianjin New Station, the second returned to Xinhe Station, and the third returned to Beitang, awaiting orders for departure. Yu Xuezhong has separately telegraphed the Ping Political Reorganization Committee to request instructions. Yin Tong stated that after receiving Yu's report, he immediately negotiated with Military Attaché Shibayama, who promised to telegraph the Kwantung Army for further negotiation. The reason the Japanese side did not allow passage was because the security team was carrying heavy weapons. After Yu negotiated with Shibayama, he notified Yu to still order the security team to advance. If there are obstacles, negotiations will continue. Yin Tong also reported the process to He Yingqin. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The 2,000-strong security team dispatched to eastern Luo to suppress bandits arrived in Luoxian on the evening of the 28th. Matsudaira, the Japanese station commander, stated that he had not received orders and refused passage. He boarded the train for inspection and discovered several heavy machine guns, stating that the security team should not carry such weapons and immediately forced them to return. The three trains returned to Tianjin on the 29th. Yu Xuezhong immediately telegraphed Ping for instructions. The Military Commission negotiated with Shibayama, the Japanese military attaché. Shibayama said that the security team could go to eastern Luo to suppress bandits and promised to telegraph Nakamura, the Japanese commander in Tianjin, to smooth things over. It is expected that they can depart again within a day or two. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shi Yousan, the Old Mouse, and his associates came to Tianjin a few days ago and stayed on Miyajima Street in the Japanese concession. After negotiating with the Japanese side, Old Mouse took the route through Dalian and returned to eastern Luo. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>The newly organized security team from Changli, coming east, was forcibly blocked and returned by the Japanese in Luo. Our side is currently negotiating with them to continue eastward, but there are still no results. Three Japanese people arrived in Changli this afternoon, ordering all Japanese merchants to gather at the Gaochang Foreign Firm, and claiming that tonight bandits will flee from Funing to Changli, and that Old Mouse has planted spies who claim that Changli will be attacked on the 30th, causing utter panic among the people, who are preparing to flee west en masse. Team Captain Dou stated that he had received reports that bandits would flee to Changli and that he was determined to use all his strength to meet and suppress them. He would also take this opportunity to send troops to recover Funing County and pursue them back to their bandit nest. He said that they currently have enough strength to suppress the bandits and there is no need to worry. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) For the purpose of suppressing bandits in eastern Luo, Yu Xuezhong selected 2,000 men from his 118th Division and reorganized them into a security team, which set out towards Changli yesterday. This aims to regain the Funing County seat occupied by the bandit gang, and its success or failure has a significant impact on the situation in eastern Luo. (29th Reuter's Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Chinese side, under the pretext of suppressing Old Mouse in eastern Luanzhou and eastern Yongping, has reorganized the 650th and 653rd teams of Yu Xuezhong's 110th Division into a security team, invading the demilitarized zone stipulated in the armistice agreement. The Kwantung Army believes that this is an act of contempt for the agreement and a violation. Military Attaché Shibayama protested to He Yingqin on the 29th and notified Yu Xuezhong's troops that if they do not withdraw within a week, drastic measures will be taken.

<h3>Ministry of Industries Reports on the Salt Land Reclamation Conference</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industries submitted a report to the Executive Yuan on the proceedings of the Huainan Salt Land Reclamation Discussion Conference. The original text stated: "The Huainan salt land reclamation area stretches six hundred li from Nan Yunwusi in the south to Funing Miaowan in the north, and a hundred li in width. It was originally the area where Huainan's salt industry supplied grass for boiling salt. Since Zhang Jianzhi founded the Tongguan Reclamation and Pasture Company in the twenty-seventh year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, more than forty large and small companies have been established over more than thirty years, covering approximately ten million mu of land with an investment of over 20 million yuan. As of recent years, only a little less than 20% of the land has been successfully reclaimed. In a good year, the production can reach about 500,000 to 600,000 dan of cotton, but in a year of famine, it is only 100,000 dan. The production of beans is even lower, not enough to feed the residents of the area. Currently, among these forty companies, only one or two can barely survive, while the rest have ceased to operate or are on the verge of collapse. The vast land is left barren, factory construction is incomplete, water conservancy is underdeveloped, there is no way to discharge western water, and there is a lack of defenses against eastern tides. Secondly, capital is insufficient and expansion is difficult, agriculture is neglected, and production is weak. Companies in this situation find it difficult to cope. As a result, those who have invested are happy to escape, and those who have not invested are hesitant to move forward. The Ministry is responsible for land reclamation and appointed technician and rice director Pi Zuoqiong to consult with the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry on rectification methods and to conduct on-site inspections. However, the plan was suspended due to the abolition of the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Industry. As a result of the Ministry's Salt Land Reclamation Conference on September 15: (1) It is proposed to establish a Huainan Land Reclamation Special Zone Committee, which will be submitted by the Ministry to the Executive Yuan to be jointly organized by the National Economic Council, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Interior, the Huai River Guidance Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, the Shanghai Banking Association, the Joint Association of Huainan Salt Land Reclamation Companies, and the Ministry. (2) It is proposed to submit a request from the Ministry to the Executive Yuan to allocate 30 million yuan from the Central US Cotton and Wheat Loan as a special fund for the construction of the Huainan Land Reclamation Special Zone. The Ministry has carefully considered that these two resolutions are consistent with the Executive Yuan's 126th meeting regarding Minister Song's proposal to entrust the economic commission to design and manage the Huainan salt land reclamation and to have relevant agencies participate, as well as the central government's repeated declarations regarding the use and distribution of US cotton and wheat.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>From Compromise to Unity by Zi</h3>
<p>The Central Standing Committee passed the proposal on the 28th to postpone the Fifth National Congress. Those who expect the Fifth National Congress to bring about political renewal and the emancipation of political power must be disappointed upon hearing this news. However, if we consider the need for compromise within the country, then we cannot fail to understand the difficult situation the central cadres of the Kuomintang are in, making such concessions to seek consensus.</p>
<p>According to the Party Charter, the National Congress of the Kuomintang is held every two years. The Fifth National Congress is particularly noteworthy to the people because it will discuss the proposal to convene the National Assembly ahead of schedule, which is greatly related to the opening of political power by the Kuomintang. The decision to (hold the National Assembly in March 1935) was made at the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fourth Central Committee on December 20 last year. In March of this year, the Central Standing Committee, in order to convene the National Assembly ahead of schedule, resolved to hold a National Provisional Delegates' Congress on July 1 to discuss and decide on the matter. Later, due to objections from Guangdong, the Central Standing Committee resolved on June 1 to cancel the Provisional Congress with the aim of eliminating misunderstandings within the Party and to hold the Fifth National Congress on November 12 in accordance with Article 27 of the Party Charter. The main agenda of the Fifth National Congress remains to convene the National Assembly ahead of schedule, which is imaginable. Now, due to the Southwest Committee's request to stop the convocation, the Fifth National Congress has been postponed to November next year. The cancellation of this Provisional Delegates' Congress and the postponement of the Fifth National Congress are precisely for compromise in order to seek consensus, which is also foreseeable. However, we hope that in addition to seeking compromise to avoid disputes, the central cadres of the Kuomintang will take further steps to find appropriate ways to achieve unity, so as to avoid harming the country due to the disintegration within the Party.</p>
<p>As for the realization of unity, the public announcement of all matters is particularly necessary. Today, foreigners are watching us intently, and those who hate us are taking the opportunity to find materials to fabricate rumors. Even those who love us cannot help but lose sight of the reality due to their nervous sensitivity. Those in charge of the central government should use an extremely open attitude to stop the spread of rumors, so that all misunderstandings can be eliminated and unity can be expected. We must deal with the international environment and seek domestic unity. Otherwise, the rise of rumors will be enough to create suspicion, shake people's hearts, and hinder the success of unity.</p>
<p>We do not fail to seek the Fifth National Congress to be held on schedule and the National Assembly to be convened as soon as possible, so as to obtain the benefits of opening up political power. However, from a practical point of view, if the entire Party is not united first, then all good laws and good intentions cannot be discussed. Now that the central cadres of the Kuomintang are forced to compromise to avoid disputes, we hope that they will move from the unavoidable compromise to great unity.</p>
<h3>Gu Weijun Warns the League of Nations of an Impending War in the Far East</h3>
<p>Japan Still Occupies Our Eastern Four Provinces</p>
<p>The League of Nations Has Not Implemented Its Report</p>
<p>The World Faces a Crossroads of Danger</p>
<p>Our Country Will Not Compromise with Japan</p>
<p>(Geneva) Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative, delivered a brilliant speech at the League of Nations Assembly today, describing the extremely dark situation in the Far East. He stated that judging from the success or failure of international efforts in the political sphere, the past year must be regarded as one of the most disappointing since the establishment of the League of Nations. China, as a member of the League of Nations and a victim of armed aggression, feels this disappointment particularly acutely. The undeclared war began on September 18, 1931. After seventeen months, the League of Nations Assembly announced its judgment, recognizing Japan's occupation of the three northeastern provinces as an act of violating the League of Nations Covenant, the Paris Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty. All countries present accepted this judgment. Japan then proceeded to attack and occupy Rehe, and there was a threat to the safety of Pingjin. China, with all its strength, was unable to single-handedly stop the aggressor's fierce flames, fought hard for fifty days, with 30,000 dead and wounded. China was finally forced to sign the Tanggu Truce Agreement on May 31, 1933. Although the Japanese army gradually withdrew from the vicinity of Pingjin, the four northeastern provinces are still occupied by it, regardless of Article 10 of the League of Nations Covenant. China is determined to maintain all its rights and will never recognize or acquiesce to the illegal fait accompli. China believes that maintaining this position is not only to maintain the integrity of its territory, but also to resist the plot to destroy the League of Nations Covenant and turn it into waste paper. This plot is now adopting a very powerful form of oppression, inducing China to abandon its policy of cooperation with the League of Nations and adopt the "Asia for Asians" doctrine. Legally speaking, the situation has not changed. The League of Nations Covenant must be upheld. What is regrettable is that the report passed unanimously by the special meeting of the League of Nations Assembly has not yet been implemented. If the Covenant is waste paper east of the Suez Canal, then how can this Covenant become a reality in Europe? No violation of the Covenant is greater than this case. In the future, any new international agreements aimed at stabilizing the economy, reducing armaments, or maintaining peace will face an insurmountable obstacle from this case, or at least an obstacle to their progress. When Dr. Gu reached this point, he issued a warning, saying, "Dark clouds are now rising in the international sky of the Far East. The arms race has already begun. Large-scale naval and air force exercises, the concentration of fleets, and the sharp increase in military spending have followed one after another. All kinds of signs in the Far East indicate that a major war will break out within a few years." Dr. Gu concluded by saying that China still trusts in the soundness of the League of Nations' fundamental purpose and aim. "We have now reached the crossroads of the world's safety. One is armed peace, and the other is accepting a peace of just collective responsibility. Which one to choose is up to us. For the sake of civilization and humanity, I hope we choose wisely."

<h3>Important Development in Disarmament Negotiations: First Meeting of French and German Foreign Ministers</h3>
<p>Peng Gu Insists on the Paris Four-Power Agreement</p>
<p>Niu Te Returns to Berlin Today for Instructions</p>
<p>(Geneva) After a period of stagnation, the disarmament issue has seen an important development today. When German Foreign Minister Niu Lait and French Foreign Minister Peng Gu met, Peng Gu reportedly expressed France's attitude, stating that France now insists on the agreement reached in Paris with Britain, the United States, and Italy. The three key points held by France are: (1) managing armaments, (2) a four-year trial period, and (3) no disarmament during the period. Niu Lait immediately rejected this, but will go to Berlin on Saturday to discuss it with Prime Minister Hitler. It is also reported that Peng Gu urged Niu to return to Geneva with concrete proposals so that the Disarmament Conference can determine the direction of its discussions when it convenes. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Su Weike and disarmament representative A Le Yaxi recently advocated adding a clause to the results of the Paris talks allowing Germany to increase its armaments and military quotas so that Germany would more easily recognize the methods agreed upon by various countries. This proposal has been rejected by Britain, France, and the United States. Therefore, the Italian representative believes that the only solution lies in direct negotiations between France and Germany. French Foreign Minister Peng Gu also notified German Foreign Minister Niu Lait yesterday that Paris, London, and Washington have the same views on disarmament, namely: (1) establishing an international permanent and self-motivating arms supervision system, (2) stipulating a trial period, and (3) each country disarming in stages. This is the result of the Paris talks. German Foreign Minister Niu Lait's response will undoubtedly be a rejection. This is not surprising, because what Germany has recently demanded is an increase in armaments and military quotas, and the methods advocated by Britain, France, and the United States cannot completely satisfy Germany's demands. The Italian representative is eager for both sides to reach a compromise. Today, he advised Niu Lait to clearly express Germany's objections and hopes. Niu Lait said that he must consult with his government, so negotiations must be temporarily suspended until the Berlin government replies. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) German Foreign Minister Niu Lait is scheduled to depart for Berlin at 6:00 PM today. German Propaganda Minister Guo Peier will return home by plane. Niu will have a final meeting with Italian representative A Le Nongxi and Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Su Weizhi this afternoon. This morning, A Le Yaxi and Su Weizhi met with British Foreign Secretary Simon. The rumor that Simon would return home has been officially denied. Simon is now working hard to get Italy to support the British, French, and American agreement on disarmament issues. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Solidarity in Central and Near East</h3>
<p>Negotiations to Conclude Black Sea Treaty</p>
<p>Romanian capital, Yugoslav King Alexander, Bulgarian King Boris, and Romanian Foreign Minister Tidduruss Ge will travel to Athens and Istanbul in Turkey, as well as Ankara. Well-informed sources here believe that Romania, Greece, Bulgaria, Turkey, and Soviet Russia may soon unite to conclude a (Black Sea Treaty). In recent days, not only have people directly concerned about this treaty often talked about it, but the authorities of the Little Entente countries have also repeatedly mentioned it. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>The countries near the Black Sea in the Romanian capital are now preparing to conclude a treaty. Negotiations on this treaty are being actively conducted by the countries concerned, especially between the governments of the Little Entente countries and the Bulgarian government.

<h3>League of Nations Discusses Prohibition of Opium: China's Performance is Poor</h3>
<p>More Difficult to Ban Due to Concessions</p>
<p>(Geneva) At the Executive Yuan meeting on the 28th, the report of the Central Opium Supervisory Office was discussed, which stated that the prohibition of opium has made considerable progress in various countries around the world, but the situation in China is not good. However, due to the relationship between leased territories and concessions, the ban is more difficult to implement. Gu Weijun will explain this idea and hope that the Chinese and foreign authorities will cooperate so that the Chinese government's sincere prohibition policy can be easily implemented. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Central Opium Management Committee met this afternoon, and the Irish representative, Kai Lai, reported, drawing the committee's attention to the danger of China planting and manufacturing narcotic drugs. It is said that the Chinese government has indeed implemented prohibition measures, and the Chinese government does have various difficulties, but the committee must prevent any country from endangering other countries in order to fulfill its duties. Foreign Secretary Simon protested against the statement in the report that there are concessions and leased territories in China, and that most of these drugs are manufactured in these areas, and that Chinese police cannot interfere, making the prohibition work more difficult. He said that all areas under British influence have made every effort to implement the prohibition regulations, citing the case of the British concession in Tianjin on January 21 this year as proof. It is said that the British Municipal Council in that port arrested five Chinese who were privately manufacturing drugs and then extradited them to the Chinese police authorities, but later the leader of the five paid a small fine and was released. Chinese representative Gu Weijun replied that only Tianjin extradited the criminals to the Chinese police authorities, while other places did not. As for the incident mentioned by Foreign Secretary Simon, he will investigate it. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, the League of Nations Executive Council has filed the report of the London Economic Conference and decided to convene a certain special committee so that the work of the Economic Conference can continue. However, when the Economic Conference will resume its work has not only not been decided, but no one has proposed setting a date. After the Executive Council passed the report of the Standing Central Opium Committee, it registered the agreement recently concluded between Poland and the Free City of Danzig. This agreement stipulates how Poland uses the port of Danzig. French Foreign Minister Peng Gu and the British representative warmly congratulated on the relationship between this agreement. Finally, the Executive Council approved the report on observing the dispute over the Grand Chaco between the South American countries of Bolivia and Paraguay. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>

At that time, 120 warships and 250 aircraft will participate in the exercise. (Reuter's dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Using the Excuse of Defending Against Russia, Japan Enriches Its Military</h3>
<p>Another New Destroyer Completed</p>
<p>Opening Air Routes Between Japan and Manchuria</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of the Army issued a statement this morning, saying that Soviet Russia has an army of 1.25 million people in peacetime, equipped with the most advanced and latest military equipment, etc. It also said that Soviet Russia has recently been continuously expanding its military equipment in the Far East and has an air force, including dozens of bombers, which can attack Tokyo in wartime. The Ministry of the Army also denied the claim that Japan is currently planning to recruit four divisions, saying that it is now urgently needed to make the army modernize to protect (Manchukuo) and Japan proper to prevent this 　迫 from Soviet Russia (Reuter's dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) A spokesman for the Ministry of the Army explained to the press today why the Ministry of the Army requested a military expenditure of 620 million yen in the next budget. One of the reasons is that as a result of the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, it has completed its great military equipment. The spokesman said that the army authorities do not want to add four army divisions as reported in the newspapers, but it is urgent to complete the war products based on the post-war foundation and to guarantee the national defense of (Manchukuo) in accordance with the Japan-(Manchuria) Agreement of September 15, 1932. Today, the combat effectiveness of the Soviet army</p>
<p>Far better than the Imperial era. The Soviet army is organized based on the post-war foundation, with 75 infantry divisions and 35 cavalry divisions. In peacetime, it has 1.3 million soldiers. In addition, there are 2,200 aircraft, 1,500 tanks, and many chemical warfare teams. The dispute in Manchuria, of course, makes the situation between Japan and Russia tense. The Soviet Union is now garrisoning ten divisions, 300 tanks, and hundreds of aircraft in the Far East, including dozens of heavy bombers, which are very easy to fly to Tokyo and Osaka (Reuter's dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>The new destroyer Ziri, built by the Uraga Shipbuilding Company in Yokosuka, with a displacement of 1,400 tons, will soon be fully equipped and is scheduled to be handed over to the Navy on the morning of the 30th. This ship belongs to the Yokosuka Naval District. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Yokosuka The landing point of the new Japan-Manchuria air route is Rajin. Now, to commemorate the opening of the port, the Navy has started the first crossing of the Sea of Japan with a three-boat formation. The boats were sent off by Commander Nomura with a speech at 8:00 AM and departed from Yokosuka, arriving in Maizuru at 11:20 AM. They are scheduled to take off from Maizuru at 7:00 AM on the 30th, cross the Sea of Japan and fly to Rajin in Korea, a distance of 789 miles. They plan to return immediately after arrival.

<h3>Soviet Russia Takes a Strong Stance on the Arrest of Russian Personnel on the Eastern Route</h3>
<p>Protests to Japan and the Puppet Regime Separately</p>
<p>Japan Avoids Direct Conflict with Russia</p>
<p>Indicates Concession in Road Purchase Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to diplomatic sources, Japan is aware that Russia's attitude is very firm. If Japan and the puppet regime use force to seize the road, they will use force to protect the road against Japan and the puppet regime. Judging from the current situation, unless the military authorities realize that they are at war with Russia again, there is no way to resolve the policy of using force to seize the road. Foreign Minister Hirota is deeply worried about this crisis and asked the puppet regime's representative, Ohashi Tadaichi, to come to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday to discuss countermeasures. The puppet regime is also aware that the situation is very critical and intends to resolve the case of the purchase of the China Eastern Railway by making concessions. It is said that the puppet regime will no longer insist on the price of 50 million yuan for the purchase and will take the middle price between the Russian side's selling price of 200 million yuan and the puppet regime's 50 million yuan to resolve the road case and avoid a direct conflict. (China United Press dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Russian ambassador to Japan, You Lielev, visited Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday to express his views: (1) The (Manchukuo) arrested employees of the China Eastern Railway, threatening the lives of Russian employees, and may hinder the operation of the China Eastern Railway. A serious protest is made here. (2) It is believed that the arrest of the employees was based on the instructions of the Japanese government, so a serious protest is also made to the Japanese government. (3) This 　illegal act, from the Soviet Russian point of view, is considered to be caused by the South Manchuria Railway Company wanting to stop the road negotiations. It is hoped that Your Excellency will promote (Manchukuo)'s consideration. Foreign Minister Hirota replied as follows: It is a misunderstanding to discuss the arrest of employees of the North China Railway together with the negotiations on the North China Railway. If the Soviet Russian side has any proposals, the (Manchukuo) side intends to continue the North China Railway meeting. As for the arrest, it can be completely resolved due to the successful establishment of the transfer negotiations, and it can prevent other problems. As a result, it was decided that the North China Railway transfer negotiations would continue at the Deputy Minister's residence today. Ambassador You Lielev resigned at 7:30 PM. (Telegraphic dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Pan Dula, Deputy Director of the Soviet Union of the China Eastern Railway, wrote to Director Li Shaogeng, reiterating that the arrest of Soviet officials of the China Eastern Railway and the appointment of Manchu officials to take over proved that the Soviet government's report of a plan to seize the China Eastern Railway by force was not false. Pan's letter mentioned Li Shaogeng's proposed explanation that the arrest was legal. Li said that the arrest was based on the reports of six audit directors and prosecutors, but Li himself did not know the content of the reports and the 确　charges against the arrested. At the same time, the chairman of the Audit Committee (Manchu) side also gave the same answer in a letter answering the question from Ma Gong, the Soviet member of the committee. Therefore, Pan said that (the steps reported by the audit director (the result led to the arrest) were not notified to his superiors, that is, the Audit Committee (its chairman was also included). Pan said that the audit director was not a (Manchu) national official, but only an employee of a business managed by representatives of the two countries. At the same time, he cited the regulations on audit work to prove that the audit director's responsibility was to first notify the director of the railway administration and the Audit Committee as much as possible of the various defects he knew. Therefore, Pan insisted that according to the regulations on the work of auditors, his work should not only be difficult for the normal work of the railway, but also actively cooperate with the railway administrative organs. Pan made a strong protest against the audit director's destruction of existing regulations, saying (the Manchurian authorities disregarded existing regulations and agreements and arrested the station chiefs of the two stations and a number of senior officials of the China Eastern Railway (all of whom were Soviet people). The audit director and (Manchurian) authorities adopted this approach, and Your Excellency's request to appoint (Manchu) officials to take over the arrested Soviet officials clearly proves that the sole purpose of these arrests is to eliminate the Soviet station chiefs and senior officials of all sections and replace them with (Manchu) officials). Pan concluded (based on the authentic report of the Soviet government 　, the purpose of this step by the (Manchurian) authorities is to make one-sided and brutal destruction of all existing agreements related to the China Eastern Railway, and the above-mentioned facts prove that the report is indeed correct) (Tass dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Russian Newspapers Denounce Japanese Use of Puppets for Aggression</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Since the Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs issued a statement on the China Eastern Railway incident on the 21st, directly scolding Japan as the master of Manchuria, the Soviet party and government organs have repeatedly pointed out Japan's behavior in the same way. The Moscow Daily editorial on the 28th roughly stated that (the Manchurian government) is a puppet of Japanese imperialists, used as a tool to promote the plan of aggression, which is a fact known to the world. It also said that the Japanese government mistakenly believes that the Soviet Union loves peace and fears war. Finally, it stated that the Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs' warning is not an empty threat to Tokyo. It must be known that the Soviet government has always taken a firm attitude to protect the interests of its working people. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Ishii Expresses His Views in Hong Kong on His Way Home</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Ishii and Fukai, the Japanese plenipotentiaries who attended the World Economic Conference, passed through Hong Kong on the Hakone Maru on their way home and chatted with reporters on the ship, but they were unwilling to say much about the reasons for the breakdown of the conference. However, Viscount Ishii answered reporters' questions, saying that Japan currently considers it to be an extraordinary period, and Europe and the United States should also consider it to be an extraordinary period, because people each think that the disease they suffer from is worse than others, so they feel this way. When asked what their views were on the Japanese people's expectation that a preparatory meeting could be convened on the Japan-US arbitration treaty after the two representatives returned home, he replied that not only had he not heard of this situation, but he had never thought about it. The two representatives made a brief stop in Hong Kong and continued their journey home on the Hakone Maru at 5:00 PM today. (Japan United Press dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>British and American War Debt Issues</h3>
<p>US Secretary of State Claims to Transfer the Matter to the Treasury Department</p>
<p>Preliminary Negotiations to Begin Early Next Month</p>
<p>The Scope of Talks Will Be Expanded</p>
<p>Stabilizing the Dollar Will Also Be Considered</p>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Hull announced today that the revision of war debt negotiations will be handled by the Treasury Department together with British representative Lees-Rose next month, that is, at the Treasury Department meeting, not at the State Department. Hull's statement was quite unexpected to the general public, because war debt issues have always been handled by the State Department and supervised by the White House. Now, it has suddenly been transferred to the Treasury Department, although it will still be presided over by the President. It is expected that the nature of the talks will be slightly different from before. It is reported that the US representatives will be Undersecretary of the Treasury Acheson and Deputy Economic Technician of the State Department Lee Versai. Hull did not disclose further details, but financial and gold experts generally believe that various issues related to stabilizing the gold dollar will be discussed in the future. Currency experts also believe that the change of war debt negotiations to be undertaken by the Treasury Department can greatly confirm the President's intention to change the gold dollar and implement a new currency policy. According to the news, the war debt negotiations will begin next week after the US President and the British representative have preliminary talks at the White House. (National News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Although Treasury Department officials have stated that the content of the war debt negotiations will not be released until after the end, it is widely rumored here today that the British representative will propose a lump sum payment as repayment. Many members of the US Congress have heard of this and some have expressed their support, as long as Britain does not ask for too much reduction. However, if the rumors from outside are resolved with 10% of the total amount owed, then it is feared that few in Congress will support it. According to reports, the principal owed by Britain is still 3.6 billion yuan. London sources said that Britain will propose to pay a lump sum of 10% of this amount as a 　settlement. As for what method to use for the lump sum payment, economists here are worried, because it is said that if Britain can agree to purchase silver in the United States for a lump sum payment, then the inflation currency faction in Congress may agree to it. However, most people think that this statement is too close to ideal, especially in view of the fact that the scope of negotiations is about to be expanded. Today, the US government has admitted that if the British representative raises economic, currency, or trade issues, the US representatives will discuss them. However, the US government cannot guarantee what other methods can be accepted by the United States besides full repayment. It only said that if the lump sum payment method is rejected by the US side, then the British representative will definitely talk about revising the amount to be repaid every six months. Most observers believe that if the second method is followed, then it is feared that Britain will not be able to guarantee payment of this amount until the price of gold in the United States has been reasonably stabilized. It is now believed that the initial negotiations between the two sides are still preparatory in nature. After the preliminary negotiations proceed smoothly, Britain will send additional representatives. (National News Agency dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>Labor Strikes Spread, Hindering Recovery</h3>
<p>(New York) Labor strikes are spreading in the United States, and the rise in prices continues to be higher than income, which has gradually made people feel disappointed in the recovery movement. The National Industrial Recovery Act Enforcement Office is now preparing to gradually withdraw its governing policies in order to allow various industries to adjust themselves, and only intervene when it is necessary to implement industry regulations. At the same time, the American Federation of Labor has taken a tougher stance and is preparing a plan for 30 working hours per week. The Recovery Act Enforcement Office is now receiving thousands of complaints, consumers are complaining about high prices, and laborers are selling each other by violating industry regulations. Today, officials at the Treasury Department in Washington said that the authorities' failure to announce their currency policy has hindered commercial expansion. 650,000 people recovered their jobs in August, but even if the current numbers can be maintained, there will still be 11 million people waiting for relief this winter. Automobile industry tycoon Ford is now resisting the Recovery Act Enforcement Office and has closed his Kirster factory, unwilling to submit labor-management disputes to the Recovery Act Enforcement Office for mediation. Labor strikes in the coal mining industry, steel industry, and silk industry are now spreading one after another. (Reuter's dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Progress in the Cuban Situation</h3>
<p>Labor unrest gradually subsides, government position consolidates.</p>
<p>Some advocate adopting a responsible cabinet system.</p>
<p>(Havana) The American destroyer USS Hamilton is prepared to leave Guantanamo Bay, Cuba today, as the strike involving American interests in that port has been temporarily resolved.

The new government is consolidating its position with remarkable speed. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, Cuban Minister of Health Finlay assured that Cuba would adopt a responsible cabinet system similar to that of France, greatly reducing the power of the president, so that a dictatorial government like that of former President Machado would not easily reappear. He does not believe that the United States will oppose Cuba abandoning the American system and adopting a parliamentary cabinet system. After meeting with Undersecretary of State Caffery at the State Department today, Finlay expressed optimism regarding the United States' recognition of the new government of San Martín.

<h3>Confession of Lubbe, the Prime Suspect in the German Reichstag Fire</h3>
<p>Admitted Arson Without Reservation.</p>
<p>(Leipzig, Reuter, 29th) This morning, during the trial of the Reichstag fire case, the presiding judge asked Lubbe whether he had set fire to the Reichstag. Lubbe nodded and said yes. The judge then read out Lubbe's confession during the preliminary hearing, stating that on the evening of the 28th, he carried many flammables to the Reichstag, placed them in various parts of the building, and used his clothes as tinder. He did not carry kerosene or other highly flammable substances, but it was not difficult to ignite the large timbers. He was arrested twenty minutes later. After the reading, the judge asked Lubbe again if the confession was accurate, and Lubbe nodded again and said yes.</p>
<h3>Hitler Convenes Meeting of Regional Governors</h3>
<p>Preparing to Centralize Power.</p>
<p>The federal system exists in name only.</p>
<p>(Berlin, Havas, 28th) Premier Hitler convened a meeting of the governors of the German Länder (now changed to regions) at the State Council. (Note: the governor system was established in April of this year.) Hitler himself presided over the meeting. The discussion seemed to focus on the issue of reforming the German organizational law. Since April 8 of this year, when the central government adopted preparatory measures to unify Germany (referring to the appointment of governors to unify the internal organization of Germany), the Länder have existed in name only. The purpose of this meeting is clearly for the National Socialist government to incorporate all German regions into Prussia, in preparation for centralizing power. A communiqué was issued after the meeting stating that Premier Hitler explained the German political and economic situation and the responsibilities of the governors, emphasizing that the Länder should respect the authority of the central government and that the National Socialist government must ensure its security so that it can exercise its functions. The conclusion stated that regional governors should severely punish any demonstrations that disrupt order, without any leniency, and that German policy should pay special attention to current needs. The last sentence seems to refer to the relationship between the central government and the Länder, as well as the relationship between the central government and the National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>(Berlin, Havas, 29th) Röhm, Chief of Staff of the National Socialist Party Army, ordered that the Steel Helmet League should henceforth be governed by the Supreme Commander of the Sturmabteilung (i.e., Hitler).</p>

<p>A dispatch from Harbin reports that recently the Japanese army has been reorganizing the puppet troops in the Northeast, confiscating civilian guns, and implementing a policy of subjugation. Therefore, popular uprisings and revolts by puppet troops have occurred one after another. For example, Zhang and Feng, two battalion commanders of the puppet police reserve team in Zhaodong County, Heilongjiang Province, led their cavalry of more than 700 men to revolt under the command of a certain party at the beginning of this month, carrying four mortars and twelve light and heavy machine guns, crossed the Nen River, and attacked Shuangcheng County, Jilin.

<h3>Fang Ji and Others Move West from Gaoliying</h3>
<p>Wan Fulin and Xu Tingyao Lead Troops to Block</p>
<p>Fang Ji and Others Attack Xiaotangshan</p>
<p>Japanese Army Advances to Niulanshan</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Peiping reports that after Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, and others entered the war zone, they changed their banner to "Suppressing Bandits" and advanced towards Peiping and Tianjin. On the 26th, they divided their forces and fiercely attacked Gaoliying, Xiaotangshan, and other places. After receiving the alarm, the Peiping authorities, in addition to diplomatic efforts, dispatched Wan Fulin, Shang Zhen, and Xu Tingyao to lead troops to block them. Shang was responsible for the eastern route, Wan was responsible for the central route, and Xu was responsible for the defense of Peiping and the Ping-Sui Railway. Shang's two divisions, Huang Guanghua and Li Xingcun, were assigned to the Dongba and Tongzhou areas. Wan's divisions, Zhou Fucheng and Zhu Hongxun, were deployed in Gaoliying, Tangshan, Heshan, and Changping. Xu's division, Huang Jie, guarded Nankou, and Guan Linzheng's division was stationed in Beiyuan. The defense was comprehensive and extremely tight.</p>
<p>Gaoliying is located on the Pinggu Avenue, 61 li from Peiping, and borders the war zone, south of Niulanshan. Fang's Wang Zhongfu division gradually concentrated in Niulanshan from Huairou on the 24th and 25th. At 2:00 AM on the 26th, they left Niulanshan and advanced south. At 4:00 AM, they arrived at Gaoliying, which was the defense area of Zhao Jingmin's regiment of Zhou's division of Wan's army. Zhao's regiment arrived at night on the 25th to deploy their defenses and hastily responded to the battle. Fang's cavalry broke into the north street of Gaoliying. Zhao's troops guarded the south street, facing each other in street fighting. The soldiers could see each other and communicate. From 4:00 AM, Fang's troops launched several attacks, but Zhao's regiment deployed 22 machine guns and fought fiercely for a day and a night. Fang's troops were unable to withstand the attack and retreated to Banqiao Village at 6:00 AM on the 27th. At the same time, the Japanese army's deadline for Fang's troops had expired, so they dispatched the 5th Regiment of the 8th Division from Miyun to advance south and station in Huairou. The vanguard reached Niulanshan. Fang then changed their plan and gradually advanced from Banqiao Village to Xingshou Village, Xiaotangshan, and merged with Ji Hongchang's troops to seize Tangshan and break through Changping. The battle of Gaoliying thus ended.</p>
<p>When Fang's troops attacked Gaoliying, Ji Hongchang, Zhan Tao, Rong Sandian, and Li Dexin of Fang's troops advanced west from Huairou and arrived at Shangxiayuan, Xingshou Village, Shangbaoquan, and other places to attack Xiaotangshan. Tangshan is a famous scenic spot in northern Peiping, belonging to Changping County, 50 li from Andingmen in Peiping. Kang's regiment of Zhu's division of Wan's army was stationed here. Fang's troops from Gaoliying had already turned west. On the afternoon of the 27th, they arrived in the area south of Xingshou and merged with Ji's troops. Fang and Ji personally commanded in Xingshou. That evening, they occupied Datangshan and advanced to Liushu Village, only one li from the Xiaotangshan street, and the situation was extremely tense. This morning (28th) at about 3:00 AM, the vanguard of Fang's troops attacked Xiaotangshan again from Nanzhongzhuang. The garrison responded with machine guns until dawn. Fang Ji and others are still in the Mayu, Qincheng, and Nanzhuang areas. It is reported that Fang Ji's target seems to be Yanqing in the Chahar border, seeking to unite with Tang Yulin, Liu Guitang, and others.</p>
<p>Since Fang Ji and others entered the border, Japanese aircraft have flown to the Gaoliying and Tangshan areas to bomb them. The day before yesterday, one Japanese aircraft flew to Gaoliying and dropped a bomb, which landed in Fang's defense area. Yesterday (27th) morning at 9:00 AM, two Japanese aircraft flew to Gaoliying again for reconnaissance, flying low and dropping two bombs in the Linxi area, which landed in the Wan army's position, killing two soldiers and wounding three. The Peiping authorities, upon receiving the report, immediately dispatched personnel to negotiate with the Japanese side. The Japanese side stated that it was a misunderstanding. Today (28th) morning, Commander Magata of the 5th Regiment and Lieutenant Watanabe Takashi visited Regiment Commander Zhao in Gaoliying to express their apologies and offered each wounded soldier 10 yuan as consolation money. At 11:00 AM, Shibayama, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, also visited He Yingqin at Jurentang, stating that Fang's troops had been expelled from the war zone and verbally apologized for the bombing of Gaoliying. However, while apologizing, the Japanese side continued to order aircraft to drop bombs at will. This morning at about 9:00 AM, two more Japanese aircraft flew to Tangshan, circled twice, and dropped four bombs, one landing on the Tangshan Road, one landing in Tangshan Park, one landing outside the west wall of the street, and the other landing in a wasteland. All of them exploded, fortunately without injuring anyone. At about 10:00 AM, two more Japanese aircraft flew over Peiping City for reconnaissance, circled once, and dropped a communication tube in the Japanese barracks. It is reported that when Fang's troops arrived in the Xingshou and Qincheng area yesterday, four Japanese aircraft also flew to bomb them. Three soldiers of Fang's troops were killed and nine were injured. Two of the seriously injured died today. As for the Japanese army, under the pretext of expelling Fang's troops, they dispatched the 5th Regiment of the 8th Division to enter the war zone, first concentrating in Miyun. On the 26th, after Fang's troops went south, the regiment moved from Miyun to Huairou on the 27th, and another part advanced to Niulanshan. The Japanese soldiers, who had been withdrawn after a long negotiation, are now rampaging in the war zone again. The Peiping authorities will negotiate with the Japanese side to urge them to respect the truce agreement. (September 28th)</p>

<h3>Hunan Rice Shipped to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Guangdong Chamber of Commerce President Zou Dianbang Comes to Hunan to Negotiate</p>
<p>Hunan Provincial Officials and Merchants Decide to Undertake Large-Scale Shipping</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha reports that Hunan Province has had bumper harvests of grain and rice for the past two years, with excessive surpluses. Rice is piled up like mountains in the lakefront counties, causing prices to plummet, rural economies to collapse, and all industries to be sluggish. Grain and rice were originally a major export of Hunan Province, with annual rice tax revenue usually around 3 million yuan. Last year's revenue was no more than 1 million yuan. The current rice tax has been reduced to only 20 cents per picul (previously 1 yuan, then reduced to 80 cents, then reduced to 40 cents, and now reduced to 20 cents), but exports are still scarce. Government tax revenue has been greatly affected. Currently, the average rice price is 4.4 yuan per picul, and even the highest-quality machine-milled rice is only sold for 5.8 yuan per picul. Moreover, each picul is 108 liters, weighing 145 catties, which is truly the lowest price in more than 20 years of the Republic of China. Last year, He Jian convened the Changsha banking community and raised 1 million yuan to ship Hunan's grain and rice to Shanghai, Guangzhou, Peiping, Hankou, and other areas to rescue Hunan's rural economy. He also strongly requested the central government to implement taxes on foreign rice to relieve the sale of Hunan rice, and specially dispatched Ling Ruigong, a member of the Specialized Construction Committee, to Guangdong to negotiate everything with the Guangdong authorities and merchants. At that time, because foreign rice could not be taxed, except for several batches shipped to Hankou for sale, the other ports of Guangzhou and Shanghai could not be started. Recently, Guangdong Province implemented taxes on foreign rice, and Guangdong merchants brewed a strike. Zhang Peiqian, Hunan's special representative in Guangdong (formerly Zhang Qixiong, commander of the 19th Division), telegraphed He Jian, requesting that Hunan rice be shipped to Guangdong as soon as possible. He believed that this was the best opportunity to promote Hunan rice and immediately telegraphed Zhang Kailian, Director of the Hunan Department of Finance, from Pingxiang to handle it expeditiously. The telegram said, ("I have just received a telegram from Brother Peiqian, rice is being taxed on foreign goods. This time, the Guangdong authorities are resolutely implementing it, and the motives are far-reaching and great. If we want to protect China's agricultural products, we must use tariff barriers to achieve success. From now on, Hunan is the production area and Guangdong is the sales area, and the supply and demand are mutually needed, and the annual calculation is more than ten thousand. However, the encroachment of foreign rice has been a disadvantage for a hundred years, and a few unscrupulous merchants have taken it as a source of profit and are now brewing a strike and raising food prices to make demands. If the source of rice is cut off, the people will see panic for their food. De Gong (i.e. Li Zongren) has already issued an order to all officials and people in Guangxi Province to increase transportation regardless of cost. Our Hunan should also cooperate fully, in the official sector without considering the amount of freight, and in the private sector without considering the current benefits, to break through this barrier, and then the rights and interests can be permanently guaranteed. Although it is directly for Guangdong's benefit, it is indirectly for Hunan's benefit. I beg your Excellency to telegraph the Guangdong merchants and authorities to admire this proposition, and to declare that a large amount of Hunan rice will be transported to Guangdong to silence the mouths of unscrupulous merchants, and to quickly handle the transport of a large amount of Hunan rice to Guangdong to relieve the food panic and regulate the rural economy in Hunan. This is indeed an excellent opportunity to promote Hunan rice and save the rural economy. In addition to replying, I have telegraphed to you, hoping you will handle it quickly without hesitation. He Jian, respectfully, on the day of You."), Director Zhang reported to Cao Botao, acting chairman of the provincial government, and all directors and members of the departments, who jointly discussed the following measures: (1) The provincial government and the Changsha banking community will jointly establish a grain and rice transport and sales agency, jointly run by officials and merchants, to transport rice to Guangdong for sale. (2) At least 4 to 5 million yuan will be prepared for the rice transport revolving fund. In addition to the 1.5 million yuan allocated by the Hunan Provincial Bank, run by the provincial government, as a fund, the Changsha banking community will be invited to invest. (3) In addition to the provincial government exempting the meter fee for rice transported to Guangdong, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Sanbei Steamship Company will be asked to reduce freight to reduce costs and facilitate sales. With the general measures already determined, Zou Dianbang, President of the Guangzhou Chamber of Commerce, arrived in Hunan at 7:00 AM on the 26th by the Xiang-E express train from Hankou to negotiate the sale of Hunan rice in Guangdong. Hunan officials and merchants expressed great welcome. Zhang Kailian, Director of the Department of Finance, and Yu Jichuan, Director of the Department of Construction, personally went to the station to greet him and took a car to the provincial government guest house. After a short rest, Zou explained the mission of his visit to Hunan, which was completely driven by conscience, welcoming Hunan rice to be transported to Guangdong for sale to resist foreign rice. Currently, there are two types of rice needed in Guangdong: one is brown rice for brewing, and the other is oil rice for cooking. Hunan is extremely rich in these two types of rice. If we can seize this opportunity to create a large-scale organization to supply the people of Guangdong, the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce is willing to provide as much financial assistance as possible and will be responsible for sales. Director Zhang and others informed him of the progress of the preparations in Hunan, and the current considerations are: one, how to facilitate transportation; and two, how to lower freight rates. Zou advocated that the wheel transport should still be used temporarily, and before the completion of the Guangdong-Han Railway, please urge the Guangdong and Hunan provincial governments to expedite the construction of the Xiang-Guangdong Highway (only the section from Lechang in Guangdong to Yizhang in Hunan is not completed) to facilitate transportation. The colleagues of the provincial government believed that this matter was the most important undertaking for Hunan at present and decided to host a banquet for Zou and the presidents of various banks in Changsha at the provincial government guest house at 5:00 PM this (27th) afternoon to discuss the implementation plan for the sale of Hunan rice in Guangdong. This matter is to meet Guangdong's needs with Hunan's surplus, and it is easy to see its success. It is said that Zou decided to enter Guangdong via Chenzhou Yizhang Lechang after the negotiations are completed to investigate the condition of the Xiang-Guangdong Highway to facilitate its completion.

<h3>He Jian Leaves Hunan for Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Various Circles Enthusiastically Go to the Station to See Him Off</p>
<p>He Jian Publishes a Letter to His Colleagues in the Provincial Government</p>
<p>A dispatch from Changsha reports that He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route of the Bandit Suppression Army, set off from Pingxiang at 7:00 AM today (18th) to supervise the suppression of the Red Bandits. Important figures from the party, government, and military, as well as representatives from civil groups, all saw him off at the East Railway Station. For a time, firecrackers and military music were intertwined. Personnel from various departments of the headquarters had already gone to Pingxiang in advance to deploy everything. Regarding the military affairs of this province, He ordered the Provincial Security Headquarters to be responsible for handling them. Before his departure, He also published a letter to his colleagues in the provincial government, presenting five points to encourage each other. The letter said, "I, Jian, am incompetent and have governed Hunan for five years. With the help of the virtuous gentlemen and officials, the four borders are roughly secure, and the various neglected matters are gradually being addressed. However, the Red Bandits are rampant, so I have been ordered to lead troops to Jiangxi to suppress them. Although I am taking care of both sides, I have not dared to slacken. And because the task is heavy and the journey is far, what I need from my colleagues in the provincial government is even greater. We have been together for a long time, and your merits and hard work are well known. I have no worries about your following the established procedures. However, after carefully examining the situation and understanding the strength of the people, I believe that the most urgent tasks in the future are roughly a few points, which I will present concisely to encourage each other. When we return triumphantly, I will use this to assess your merits. (1) Diligently seek out the hidden grievances of the people. Politics is based on actively guiding civil affairs and passively relieving the suffering of the people. If the people's feelings are isolated, even good policies cannot be implemented. You have served for many years and are familiar with the hidden grievances of the people in this province. In the future, you should pay more attention to the following points: 1. The quality of officials in each county; 2. The quality of customs and habits in each county; 3. The current strength of the people; 4. Whether there are any malpractices that need to be eradicated urgently; 5. Whether there are any Red Bandits or bandits lurking (2) Promote the various administrations. The administrative plans for each county in this province are already extremely detailed in the policy outline and plan of this province. The provincial committees' division of inspection areas will surely have further plans for rectifying the county administration in each county. In the future, you must follow the established guidelines and implement them one by one. Prevent delays and avoid exceeding the bounds, so that all kinds of important administrations can be well managed. (3) Practice frugality. At present, we are facing internal and external troubles. Hunan is adjacent to Jiangxi and Hubei, and we fear that there are bandits lurking in the border areas. Moreover, due to economic stagnation, the strength of the people has been exhausted for a long time. We should take the meaning of resting with the people to achieve the merit of simplifying the government and harmonizing the people. In the future, all non-essential government affairs that are not related to the livelihood of the people should not be undertaken. Even the organizations and establishments of the gentry in each county that are not related to the livelihood of the people and require public funds for subsidies should be strictly prohibited. Even the previously completed plans that have not been implemented or are in progress should be weighed according to their urgency and importance. If they can be postponed, they should be postponed. If the local area has less construction, the people will preserve more vitality. This is a virtue for the common people, and the people will receive its benefits. (4) Guarantee good officials. The number of county magistrates and all auxiliary personnel in each bureau and district in this province is in the thousands. There must be many among them who are upright and capable. If there is fear of being in office for only five days, they will have the thought of not striving to be first. If they are hampered from showing their talents, how can they reach far? In the future, all virtuous and good officials should be guaranteed their positions and their effectiveness should be assessed periodically, so as to wash away the accumulated habits of following the old ways and show the spirit of striving for progress. As for corrupt officials who harm the people and mediocre people who ruin affairs, they are scourges to the community and must be eliminated. This cannot be tolerated in the slightest. (5) Be realistic and pragmatic. The source of chaos in ancient and modern times all arises from the lack of clarity between right and wrong. A country without public right is chaotic, and a family without public right is in danger. Competing for eloquence and heresy prevails, so that even the bestial theory of the Red Bandits is not rejected by the people. I used this to determine the criteria for public right in my speech on entering Germany two years ago. You, in governing civil affairs, must pay attention to this. This is one thing. The implementation of government orders is nothing more than the exchange of official documents. When an order is issued, it must be carefully matched with the actual situation, and naturally the order will be carried out. Examine the documents from each county in detail, and the hidden situation will be seen. This is another thing. Although the above four points are crucial, if they are not sincerely implemented, they are still equal to empty words. Extending this to all government affairs, it is all the same. This is another thing. This province has been stable for several years, and the government has been established for a long time. We only ask for being realistic and pragmatic. By the end of the year, there must be tangible results. This is what I hope from you. In short, the current situation in this province is no different from a dangerous boat in wind and rain. If we want to cross the mad waves safely, we must thoroughly eliminate the lurking bandits and develop political capacity to increase the people's happiness after the military campaign. The former is the full responsibility of the Central Army of the four routes and the Security Headquarters, and the latter will depend on the various members, directors, and gentlemen of the provincial government. Be careful not to indulge in pleasure, causing the previous achievements to be ruined. I leave this message on horseback, hoping you will consider it publicly. (September 18th)</p>
<h3>He Chengjun's Mission to Sichuan</h3>
<p>| Expected to Stay About Half a Month Before Returning to Hankou |</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: He Chengjun, the Pacification Commissioner of Hubei, was ordered to represent Chairman Chiang Kai-shek at the inauguration ceremony of Liu Xiang, the Commander-in-Chief of the Bandit Suppression in Sichuan Province, scheduled for October 1st. He, along with Zeng Kuoqing, a Sichuanese Central Committee member, and Qiu Jia, Liu Xiang's representative, departed from Hankou on the China National Aviation Corporation's Chongqing-bound airplane on the 27th. There were delays in Shashih (now Shashi) and Yichang. He met with Yang Shaodong, Chief of Staff of the 10th Army, Xu Yuanquan, Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in the Hubei-Hunan Border Area, Fan Xixu, Director of the Security Department, and Wang Lingji, Division Commander of the 21st Army. He spent the night in Chongqing, hosted by Guo Changming, Liu Xiang's Chief of Staff. On the 28th, he attended a welcome rally in Chongqing. He was scheduled to proceed to Chengdu by car on the 29th. He Chengjun's mission includes four items in addition to attending the inauguration: (1) To promote the benevolence and intentions of the central government. Sichuan Province is located in the remote west, with rugged mountains and rivers, making it difficult to communicate central government policies. Although there were discussions about sending high-ranking officials to Sichuan, Zhang Qun was once designated last winter, but it did not materialize due to various reasons, resulting in isolation between the central and local governments. He Chengjun, holding the position of Central Committee member and representing Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, will take this opportunity to promote the central government's benevolence. (2) To harmonize the generals and achieve unification. Sichuanese military leaders are prone to internal conflicts. For twenty years, they have been killing each other. With Liu Wenhui's defeat and Liu Xiang's appointment as Commander-in-Chief, there is now an opportunity for peaceful unification. He's westward trip will aim to have Liu Xiang, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen,</p>
<p>Liu Cunhou, etc. to work together to eliminate internal strife permanently. (3) To discuss methods for suppressing the remaining bandits. Xu Xiangqian's remnant bandits occupy several counties in northern Sichuan, requiring a comprehensive plan for suppression. After He arrives in Sichuan, he will convene a meeting of Sichuanese military leaders to discuss a major campaign to eliminate them within a specified period. (4) To investigate the local conditions of Sichuan Province. Sichuan Province is known as the "Land of Abundance," with rich resources, but it has suffered from years of civil war, causing immense suffering to the people. He Chengjun will conduct on-site investigations to report to the central government as a reference for future reconstruction and development. He Chengjun also plans to stay in Sichuan for half a month before returning east. (Dated 28th).</p>
<h3>Liu Zhenhua and Others Hold Important Meetings in Hankou</h3>
<p>Determining Rehabilitation Measures for Recovered Bandit Areas</p>
<p>Military Operations Completed, Now Focusing on Politics</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Since Liu Zhenhua ordered a general offensive against the remnant bandits in the Henan-Hubei-Anhui border area, they have shown signs of collapse. Besides concentrating the main force in Shangcheng County for a final stand, the various counties of Huangchuan, Macheng, and Lixian seem to have been pacified, and transportation in various places has also been restored. Recently, Liu again dispatched heavy troops to suppress the bandits in Shangcheng County for a third general attack. Liu's own 64th Division, Liu Maoen's 15th Army, and Song Tiancai's 74th Division each took one front. All the bandit nests in Wamiaoji, Sidaohe, Gaojiachong, Chenjiashan, Duanshiling, Hongmaojian, Baoziyan, and Dafoshan were successively captured, breaking through the last defense line of the Red bandits. On the 20th, the Red bandit's main base in Tangjiahui was surrounded. The bandits, recognizing the importance of their survival, resisted with all their might. From the 20th, they held out for seven days. On the 26th, the bandits finally collapsed, and Tangjiahui was recaptured by the 64th and 74th Divisions after bloody battles. These bandits were a mixture of the pseudo 25th and 28th Armies, and they still had more than 10,000 men after the second general offensive. The battles of Duanshiling, Dafoshan, and Tangjiahui resulted in heavy casualties, and a considerable loss of weapons and grain. The pseudo Third Front Army and the pseudo Independent Division are still attempting to reinforce them, but these forces are also remnants defeated by the National Army and are not elite troops. Although they come as a desperate flock, they will eventually collapse. With the military operations nearing completion, Liu Zhenhua deemed it necessary to focus on politics and intended to convene a meeting in Songbu, eastern Hubei, to discuss the way forward. Subsequently, as it was necessary to consult with the headquarters and exchange opinions with He Chengjun and Zhang Qun, it was decided to hold it in Hankou. Liu arrived in Hankou on the 27th with Sun Lianzhong. He Chengjun had already departed for Sichuan on the same day. On the 28th, Liu, along with Chief of Staff Cao Haosen, Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun, Pacification Headquarters Chief of Staff Yang Kuiyi, etc., discussed everything. They decided on three rehabilitation measures for the border area: (1) Armed Immigration. All fleeing civilians will be recruited back to their hometowns, trained, and armed for self-defense. (2) Improving Education. In addition to thoroughly implementing the measures set by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, adjustments will be made according to local conditions, starting with children and extending to adults. People who have been influenced by the bandits will be sent to reformatories. (3) Liu Zhenhua will issue a circular to various parties, welcoming workers and students to visit the recovered bandit areas to conduct on-site investigations, to understand the crimes of the Red bandits, and to unanimously promote anti-communism. Liang Guanying has also come to Hankou from the defense area to participate in further discussions. According to Liu Zhenhua, only 4,000 remnant bandits remain in the border area, mostly pseudo Red Guards, with less than half armed with firearms. It will not be too difficult to eliminate them, but there are countless rehabilitation issues that need to be carefully planned in advance. In other words, military force has already achieved seventy percent completion, while political implementation is awaiting effort. He has discussed measures with Chief of Staff Cao and Chairman Zhang, and will return to the defense area to implement them after further consultation. (Dated 28th).</p>
<h3>Inspection Records of Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei by Our Special Correspondent Ren An</h3>
<p>En Route from Chaling to Lianhua</p>
<p>Lianhua Special Dispatch: Lianhua is located in western Jiangxi, surrounded by mountains and strategic passes. Whenever dynasties change, it is often occupied by bandits who resist stubbornly, making it difficult to pacify. Since the spread of the Red Scourge in 1926, the county seat has fallen eight times in the past seven years. The four townships have been banditized due to the influence of neighboring areas, especially Yongxin, where the pseudo Jiangxi-Hunan Soviet government was located, and has been occupied for many years, never recovered. All the land has been controlled by the bandits, and the old social system has been almost abolished by them. Taking advantage of the National Army's advance, I went to explore the current situation and record it as follows:</p>
<p>Although Lianhua is under the jurisdiction of Jiangxi Province, the only means of transportation is the tortuous northeast route from Hualing, Hunan Province, which can be reached. Without the protection of the militia forts along the way, it is feared that this line would not be passable. I departed from Liling by car at 7 am towards Chaling. The road surface was smooth, with little jolting. The ticket sellers, ticket checkers, and drivers were more organized than on the Jiangxi provincial roads. Tung trees were planted beside the road, interspersed with willows every eight or nine trees, their verdant leaves adding to the beautiful scenery. It is said that the seeds of the planted tung trees can be used to extract oil and make fertilizer, and the wood can be used to build ships. As for consolidating the roadbed and enhancing the scenery, these are secondary benefits. At noon, the car passed through You County and arrived at Baji in Chaling County. Due to the road not being repaired, we disembarked and walked fifteen li. The team checked us three times before we entered the city.</p>
<p>I visited the county magistrate to request a military escort to Lianhua, learning that the county was still not a peaceful place, and gunshots could still be heard in remote areas. Upon returning to my lodging, I suddenly saw the streets crowded with people. Upon closer inspection, I saw two men and three women, their heads wrapped in black gauze, wearing blue clothes, with red belts around their waists, each holding a small red orange with burning incense sticks inserted on it, and a red cloth bag hanging on their chests, with the words "Pilgrimage to Mount Heng" written on it. They chanted a prayer in seven-character sentences in loud voices, accompanied by the flute sounds of their followers. The tune was mournful. They prostrated every three steps and kowtowed every five steps, chanting and walking without any sign of fatigue. I asked a bystander in surprise, and learned that they were making a pilgrimage to Mount Heng because their mother was sick and they had vowed to do so. After the illness was cured, they would make a pilgrimage once or three times a year, taking more than ten days and spending one or two hundred yuan, which they were willing to do. People seek medicine and pray to gods when they are sick. Such superstition is so prevalent that those who govern the people should quickly eradicate it, as the harm it causes is truly not insignificant.</p>
<p>The next morning, I set off on foot. Most of those going to Lianhua were porters, sedan chair carriers, and public sales transportation teams for oil and salt. Most of the porters were women, with their hair cut short and their feet unbound, walking quickly. The repair of highways, construction of bunkers, and serving as volunteers to check pedestrians were all done by men and young people aged thirteen or fourteen. Those coming from Lianhua, besides the stretcher teams carrying wounded soldiers, the remaining teams transporting salt and oil, and small merchants carrying groceries, were all empty-handed, with nothing to transport. The sedan chair carriers were called "return carriers," their wages used to be eight or nine yuan, but the return trip was as low as five yuan. At 4 pm, we arrived at Gaolong, and since there was no relatively safe village ahead, we stayed there. In the process, I visited the former residence of Tan Yankai, and saw that his house had been destroyed, and many bricks had also been used to build bunkers. The desolate scene was no different from the houses of the affected people. At night, most of the laborers in the inn did not sleep but gathered to gamble, willing to wager their hard-earned money on a single throw. My companions were disturbed and unable to fall asleep. As the rooster crowed at dawn, we agreed to start early, packing up and setting off. The moonlight was bright, the wind was clear, and the air was refreshing. However, upon passing the sentry line in the previous village, we suddenly heard the loud shout of the sentry (password), which was particularly alarming. As the sky began to dawn, we suddenly heard bugle sounds coming from above. Looking up, we saw several blockhouses standing precariously on the peaks, giving off an intimidating and inviolable air. Passing Tongmu'ao, we encountered a large-scale, solidly-built bunker located at a strategic point. It is said that the 63rd Division suffered significant casualties when capturing this stronghold. Construction work was still underway to enhance the defensive fortifications. Women who were assigned to carry bricks were coming and going continuously. When asked (if they were provided with food), they all replied (there is no wage yet, how can there be food?). When asked (how many days were they assigned to work), they replied (Eighty-three people from the village were assigned a total of three thousand bricks). Walking to Wutang, which was only fifteen li from Lianhua, the fields were already filled with drooping golden ears, but the houses were sparsely populated, and the weeds in the courtyard were as high as the steps, no less desolate than the villages of Chenghuangjie and Pingli seen along the way. Furthermore, all the nearby forests had been felled. Later, I learned that the residents of the village had surrendered the guns of the army in April, and as a result, seventy or eighty people were massacred. Upon arriving in Lianhua, it was already past noon. Although the post-disaster market was very deserted, the business of the public sales bureau for salt and kerosene was extremely crowded.</p>
<p>The post-disaster devastation of empty fields and deserted houses seen along the way was truly unbearable. The following is a summary of the notices and slogans recently issued by the government to remedy the situation: Notice from the West Route Headquarters of the Jiangxi-Guangdong-Fujian-Hunan-Hubei Bandit Suppression Army: (1) Pardon past crimes of those who surrender and reform, and prohibit retaliation for grudges. (2) Guarantee the lives and all legal rights and interests of those who surrender and reform. (3) Protect the property of local residents and distribute the captured bandit grain. (4) Provide disaster relief or allocate land to newly returned residents for cultivation. (5) All old land taxes in the bandit areas before 1921 will be waived. (6) Those who surrender in groups with guns will have their leaders promoted and their followers heavily rewarded. Proclamation from the Headquarters of the First Column of the West Route Bandit Suppression Army: In order to fundamentally eliminate the remaining bandits, the only solution is immigration and village merging (merging small villages into large villages) and clearing the fields. It also stipulates the method of building walled villages, including: (1) The number of walled villages required for the entire county should be discussed. (2) When building walled villages, priority should be given to remote areas and deep mountains where the bandits may appear at any time and where military and political forces are difficult to reach. Residents should be ordered to move to the outskirts of the mountain caves and choose a place to build a dwelling. (3) The walled villages should be built based on the mountain hazards, and the bunkers should be surrounded by ditches. The soil and bricks should be sourced locally. (4) The required materials can be requisitioned locally or used from the bricks and stones of the houses destroyed by the bandits and the dilapidated temples not listed in the canon. (5) The land within the walled village, regardless of who it belongs to, shall be designated as the residence of immigrants, and no one may refuse to erect sheds for any reason. (6) All people who move to the walled village, their original cultivated land within ten li should still be cultivated. Those farther away can exchange cultivation with neighboring residents. (7) The number of unemployed residents in the walled village who have no land to cultivate should be counted and reported to the county government to be allocated nearby in one of the following three items: (A) Bandit property recovered according to law, (B) Public wasteland (i.e., ownerless wasteland), (C) Private wasteland, i.e., the fields and mountains and forests already deserted by the owner), allowing them to cultivate temporarily. Slogans include: (People who have fled to escape the bandits, come back quickly and tidy up your hometown!), (It is not allowed to recover the old rent and old debts before the bandit area), etc.</p>
<h3>Anhui Finance Department Stops Collecting Hair Tea Tax</h3>
<p>| All Tax Bureaus Have Been Ordered to Comply |</p>
<p>Huizhou Correspondence: In recent years, the foreign trade of Chinese tea has suffered setbacks repeatedly, and tea merchants have suffered huge losses, almost to the point of not being able to sustain themselves. In addition, countries such as Japan, India, and Ceylon have exhausted their natural advantages and scientific strengths, occupying our sales markets. The government, in order to alleviate the difficulties of the merchants, has exempted all customs duties on exported boxed tea from foreign firms, in order to maintain the position of Chinese tea in the international market, reduce the cost of tea merchants, and enable them to compete with foreign merchants. Last year, the tea tax bureau in the producing area was abolished and replaced with a business tax, and the tax rate for exported boxed tea was reduced by four per mille. Unexpectedly, this year, the business tax bureaus for various types of tea in Qimen, Xiuning, and Wuyuan in Huizhou, in addition to collecting taxes on the boxed tea produced for export, also levied taxes on hair tea that had not yet been processed into boxes, at a rate of 80 cents to 1.2 yuan per dan. In addition, branch checkpoints were set up in Yixian's Yuting, Xiuning's Shangxikou, Shexian's Shendu, Qimen's Daohu Shanli, and Wuyuan's Huaqiao Takeng. All hair tea exported from the area was intercepted for taxation, which aroused strong opposition from tea merchants in various places. Hair tea refers to tea leaves that have been picked from the mountains by mountain households and dried, mixed with tea seeds, branches, and stems, and have not been selected or processed. Since the Qianlong era, it has been customary not to levy taxes on it because it is the raw material for unprocessed boxed tea. Now, levying taxes on this hair tea is tantamount to taxing tea twice, and tea merchants find it difficult to bear this heavy tax. Tea industry associations in Tunxi, Xiuning, Yixian, and Wuyuan have repeatedly lodged protests with the local business tax bureaus for tea and telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance, requesting them to follow the customary practice of collecting taxes and to stop the extra extortion. Recently, the Qimen and Yuting tax bureaus have successively received orders not to collect hair tea taxes. However, the Wuyuan bureau continued to collect taxes as usual last month, and after further negotiations by tea merchants and a reply telegram from the Ministry of Finance, the Wuyuan bureau was ordered to immediately release the detained hair tea and not to collect taxes. The two checkpoints in Huaqiao and Takeng were abolished. After receiving the order, the Wuyuan bureau knew that it was difficult to disobey the order and had already complied with the suspension of taxation. Thus, the hair tea tax dispute that had lasted for two months was resolved. (September 21)</p>
<h3>The Civil War in Guizhou Resumes</h3>
<p>You Guocai's Troops and Wang Jialie's Troops Engage in Fierce Fighting</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The forces of Wang Jialie and You Guocai in Guizhou Province have been alternately waxing and waning, and the war has been cyclical. The situation in Guizhou is not peaceful. Recently, Wang Jialie took control, and You Guocai's troops have been recuperating and building up their strength, and their strength has increased suddenly. You's troops, led by Che Mingyi, recently engaged in fierce fighting with Wang Jialie's troops, led by Liao Huaizhong, in the Tongren area. According to Wang Jialie's representative in Guangdong, You's troops have been defeated in the Battle of Tongren, and the battle has long been over. However, recently we received a telegram from You Guocai reporting a great victory in the Battle of Tongren. How the situation in Guizhou will change in this melee is still unpredictable. You Guocai's telegram is recorded as follows: (Omissions) According to a telegram from Division Commander Ku, Ru Ru, the enemy troops Liao Huaizhong, Wang Tianxi, and Cao, ordered by Shaowu (Wang Jialie), suddenly attacked Tongren in the cold, and to be compelled to exercise legitimate defense, the two divisions contacted the two divisions led by Commander Li to attack at the same time, and fought fiercely for two days and nights, and defeated all the enemy troops, and captured more than a thousand enemy guns near Zhanshutang Shantang and Tongren. The enemy troops suffered about two thousand casualties, and more than two battalions were drowned. Liao Huaizhong and Cao almost captured alive, and are now tracking and pursuing to Zhenyuan and other words. It is found that Wang Bu arbitrarily started the war, and his disrespect for peace is obvious. Wang Bu suffered this setback, and it is difficult to ensure that it will not intensify and expand the war, and it should be more difficult to make peace and compromise. In addition to still based on the original intention, I telegraph to order them to stop fighting on the spot and wait for a solution, in order to assist the public to maintain the will of Guizhou, and to telegraph to Chen Zhugong to ask for instructions. I especially telegraph to Fengwen and beg to see it, You Guocai respectfully) (September 23)</p>
<p>Songjiang - Repair of the Seawall Reported to the Province for Approval</p>
<p>The seawall in the Puhai area of this county is in danger. Recently, Commissioner Jin, along with members of the Construction Department, Weng Qie, and Secretary Wu Zhongyu, went to inspect and determined that there was indeed danger. The original seawall was a straight line. Now the wooden piles outside the seawall have been completely destroyed, causing the sea tide to directly impact the seawall body. The straight line has been destroyed and gradually become a curved line. Fortunately, the last hurricane, the wind direction was to the north, avoided causing disaster. If the wind direction is to the south, or after one or two more hurricanes, it is feared that the people of Jin will be in the belly of the fish. Commissioner Jin and the provincial committee discussed repairs, starting with emergency assistance, which will cost about 10,000 yuan. A memorial has been prepared and taken to the province by the provincial committee to request funds for construction. However, the tide of August 18 is coming soon. I don't know if construction can start immediately.</p>
<p>Suzhou - Reassignment of Squad Leaders in the Third Water District</p>
<p>Shen Gao Chen of the Third Water Public Security District returned to Suzhou yesterday (the 29th) from the province and announced that Xu Boying, the 14th Squad Leader, was transferred to be the 11th Squad Leader. The vacancy was filled by Liu. Wang Qi, the acting squad leader of the original 11th squad, was transferred back to his original post in the first squad. Gong Guoliang was reinstated as the Director of the Water Public Security District.</p>
<p>Gong Guoliang, the former director of the Third Water Public Security District, has been hired as an advisor by the Bandit Suppression Command after leaving office. According to news from the province, the Jiangsu Provincial Government will appoint Gong Guoliang as the director of the Fourth and Fifth Water Public Security Districts concurrently. The official announcement is expected to be made soon.</p>
<p>Wuxi - County Government Executes Kidnappers</p>
<p>Weng Zhendong, a resident of Dahe Township, Xuedian Township, Taibo City, 12th District, was kidnapped by bandits on August 29th of last year. Zhu Meiji, the head of the Eighth District Security Corps, successively captured seven key criminals in this case, including Huang X, Chen Zengbao, Chen Heshang, Zhuang Ahe, Fang Laifu, Zou Ashe, and Xu Fengchi, and rescued the victim. Except for Huang X, Chen Zengbao, Fang Laifu, and Zou Ashe, who were executed separately by the county court, Chen Heshang and Zhuang Ahe were interrogated severely by the county government. Chen confessed to kidnapping Weng Zhendong for ransom. The County Magistrate Yan recorded the confession and reported it to the provincial government for execution. Yesterday morning (the 29th) at 10 am, County Magistrate Yan signed the order to bring Chen Heshang to the case, verified his identity, and bound him to the South School Ground to be executed by shooting.</p>
<p>Chongming - The Tyranny of the Business Tax Bureau</p>
<p>After the reorganization of the Chongming Electric Light Factory this year, it was vigorously rectified. The electricity bills for July and August in the two districts of Chengqiao were all collected by September 20. Only the Business Tax Bureau refused to pay the electricity bill and repeatedly ignored the reminder. On September 26, the factory cut off the power line according to the regulations. The bureau sent many people to the factory to threaten them. Manager Yu argued reasonably, but the bureau staff became angry and led the crowd to detain Manager Yu back to the bureau, set up a public court privately, and the bureau staff sat in a majestic position, ordered the tea servants and cooks to act as bailiffs, and the clerks acted as recorders, pulling Yu to stand before the case, forcing him to restore the electricity. Unexpectedly, Yu refused to be subdued by the regulations of the articles of association. The bureau staff shouted at Yu, saying why didn't you report your articles of association earlier. Yu replied that the bureau was a tax collection agency and the factory was not under its jurisdiction. The bureau staff was speechless and ordered Yu to be detained, but still no solution after five hours. In the end, they falsely claimed the words "tax resistance" and confused the county government. The county government knew the inside story and was unwilling to accept it. Yu feared that there would be no evidence afterwards and no way to countersue, so he insisted that the county government formally open a court and record the facts for future reference. It is reported that the factory's board of directors has separately telegraphed to the competent authorities, requesting that it be submitted to the court for legal investigation to protect human rights and punish violence.</p>
<p>Changshu - Three Newspapers Ordered to Cease Publication</p>
<p>Eight newspapers in our county, including the Minzhong Daily and the Zhongbao, were closed overnight by the county party headquarters last autumn because their registration procedures were not in compliance, and it has been a year since then. However, those that followed the Minzhong Daily include the Zhenbao, Gangbao, Dazhong Daily, and Yubao (which voluntarily ceased publication a month ago). Unexpectedly, recently, they were again reported by the county party headquarters, claiming that the registration procedures were not in compliance and that they contained obscene words. They specially submitted a request to the Central Propaganda Committee to close them down. On the 27th, the local public security bureau received a provincial order forwarded by the county government, and the bureau immediately sent Section Chief Cao Zongyuan to execute it. However, the newspapers argued that they had already legally applied for registration and submitted a defense. The next day (the 28th), they continued to publish. As a result, the party headquarters believed that they were defying the central government's laws and sent a letter to question the county bureau. As a result, they were executed again on the night of the 28th, and all printing houses were forced to guarantee that they would not print the above-mentioned newspapers. Therefore, the newspapers have stopped publishing since the 29th.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang - Thousands of Acres of Land Collapse in Xinzhou</p>
<p>There is a place called Xinzhou downstream of Jiaoshan, surrounded by rivers on all sides, which is the border between Jiangdu and Zhenjiang. In the past, it was only an arrow's distance away from Heshangzhou. The geology was still considered strong. At that time, the upstream water force went straight down from Jiaoshan South Chao, so Xinzhou was not in danger of collapse. Later, the upstream Jinshan outer sand silted up into a beach, and its rushing water was pressing against the north of Jiaoshan. Xinzhou was right in its path, and the scouring of the river was increasing the collapse day by day, resulting in thousands of acres of mature sand fields along the West River turning into a sea. The residents there have no fields to cultivate and no land to live on. Those who have the ability move elsewhere, and those who do not have the ability live in the coastal area, like beggars. The most tragic thing is that when the great collapse occurs, the houses and belongings are not able to be moved, and all of them are lost to the raging current. The crying is deafening, and the tragedy is unbearable to witness. Wang Airen and others, who have lived there for generations, are aware that those who have collapsed cannot be recovered, and those who have not collapsed are difficult to escape. If precautions are not taken early, the entire Xinzhou will be lost to the raging current. Therefore, they have gathered many residents of the island and plan to organize a collapse prevention committee. Yesterday, they separately submitted to the Jiangdu and Zhenjiang county authorities, requesting to be put on record.</p>
<p>Nantong - Lin Biao Visits Nantong for Inspection</p>
<p>Lin Biao, President of the Jiangsu High Court, arrived in Nantong by boat from Shanghai on the 28th to inspect the Nantong County Court, the Fourth Prison, the Detention Center, and other judicial organs.</p>
<p>Lusi Fishermen Suffer Disaster and Beg for Relief</p>
<p>Lusi in Nantong suddenly suffered a tsunami, and the fishermen suffered the greatest losses. There are more than 1,700 affected households, more than 150 fishing boats were lost, and 16 fishermen were drowned. The Lusi Fishermen's Association submitted a petition to the county government on the 28th, begging for relief.</p>
<p>Hangzhou - Jiang Ying's Embezzlement of Public Funds Case Judged</p>
<p>Jiang Ying, the former magistrate of Jiaxing Zhuji County, an Anhui native, owed more than 100,000 yuan in public funds during his tenure and failed to give a clear account of it. He hid in the Shanghai Concession, and the Zhejiang Finance Department repeatedly reported and announced to pursue and collect it, but he ignored it. Later, the provincial government ordered his arrest. He was arrested by the police, brought to Hangzhou, and interrogated by the local court. The Finance Department reviewed the case files and found that the actual amount owed, excluding military advances, was 89,118 yuan. He was prosecuted for embezzling public funds. Yesterday (the 29th) at 3 pm, the judgment was announced: Wang Ying was sentenced to ten months in prison for embezzling public funds. The embezzled funds were transferred to the civil court for recovery.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Taking a Positive Stance, Saying He Will Return to Nanjing on the Night Train Tonight</p>
<p>Visiting Song Ziwen to Discuss Financial Issues</p>
<p>Yesterday, a sudden rumor spread in Shanghai that Wang, Chiang, and Song were tired of their duties, causing a great stir. However, Finance Minister Song Ziwen firmly denied it. Premier Wang Jingwei also arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 11:50 PM last night, expressing no negativity and stating that he would stay in Shanghai for one day and return to Nanjing on the night train tomorrow (today). This should dispel the rumors. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Song Denies Resignation</p>
<p>Reporters from various newspapers visited Finance Minister Song Ziwen at the Ministry of Finance office yesterday afternoon. Song stated that he absolutely had no intention of resigning and would go to Nanjing in a day or two. In this critical time of national crisis, Premier Wang is actively taking responsibility and has no intention of being passive. The same goes for Chairman Chiang. Recently, rumors have been frequently arising, making it almost impossible to correct them one by one. Therefore, the authorities do not pay much attention to them and do not want to make frequent statements, he said.</p>
<p>Wang Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</p>
<p>Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei, accompanied by Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing at 5:25 PM yesterday on the Shanghai-Ping-Liaoning through train, attached to the PCM2 sleeper car. The train arrived at Zhenru Station at 11:48 PM last night. Wang and Zeng got off the train at the station and took a car back to their residence on Bo Shi Road to rest. Armed police officers were heavily guarding Zhenru Station. Those who went to the station to welcome them included Wang's wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and several relatives of the Wang family. He visited Song to discuss financial matters.</p>
<p>Wang was wearing a dark gray silk long gown and seemed quite tired. A reporter from this newspaper approached him at the station for an interview. When asked about the rumors of his passivity, Wang said that there were too many rumors and it was okay to ignore them; they were not worth paying attention to. He would stay in Shanghai for one day and return to Nanjing on the night train tomorrow (tonight). He would talk to the reporter in detail tomorrow, he said. According to Mayor Wu, Wang came to Shanghai to visit Song Ziwen and discuss financial issues.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Says Reports of Wang and Song Resigning are Completely Untrue</h3>
<p>Deep Regret Over the False Report in the Da Mei Evening News</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the sudden report in yesterday's Da Mei Evening News that Premier Wang had resigned and come to Shanghai caused public anxiety. Mayor Wu told the Central News Agency reporters that he received a telegram from Premier Wang at 1:00 PM today (yesterday) stating that he would meet with Minister Song and Director Kong during the weekend to discuss financial matters. The outside rumors that Premier Wang had resigned and Finance Minister Song was being passive are completely untrue. It is unknown where this news came from. It is regrettable that the newspaper published it without investigating, causing public anxiety, he said.</p>
<h3>The First Batch of American Cotton Arrived Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Total of 11,350 Bales</p>
<p>4,500 Bales Uploaded to China Merchants Wharf</p>
<p>Chen Guangfu Appointed Director of the Cotton Industry Control Committee</p>
<p>The first batch of cotton purchased by the Chinese government with a loan from the United States, loaded by the United Cotton Association of New Orleans, departed from the United States on the Ethan Allen cargo ship of the Zou Fulai Foreign Firm on August 15. After a 45-day voyage, it arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. In previous days, the financial authorities kept the ship's schedule and arrival time very secret. Even the shipping company did not allow the exact date of the ship's arrival in Shanghai to be announced, only secretly informing the China Merchants Bureau to prepare for the cotton to be loaded onto the wharf. A week ago, the Fulai Foreign Firm received a telegram from the shipowner confirming that it could be imported yesterday, so it had already notified the American Cotton Management Office established by the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai. When the ship entered Wusong at 7:10 AM, it was guided into the inner Huangpu River by a pilot and berthed at the China Merchants Bureau wharf in Pudong at 11:40 AM.</p>
<p>Total Number of Items Arrived</p>
<p>The Ethan Allen ship carried a total of 11,350 bales of American cotton, all of which were American cotton purchased with loans. Therefore, the names of the purchasers were all listed on the manifest as the Chinese government. However, 6,850 bales had already been purchased by a certain party and would be collected by the owner. Therefore, it was reported that only 4,500 bales were actually unloaded onto the China Merchants Wharf. The ship also contained some crude oil from the United States.</p>
<p>Uploading to the Wharf in the Afternoon</p>
<p>The total amount of cotton that China borrowed from the United States is 4 million bales (the previous report of over 200,000 bales is completely incorrect), valued at US$40 million. The Ministry of Finance has established a management organization for purchasing and shipping cotton in the United States and has the right to sell it. If the purchaser places an order in the United States, the ship can be directly dispatched from the United States. The cotton transported to Shanghai is not all waiting to be sold, but some has already been purchased and is awaiting collection by the purchaser. The cotton on the Ethan Allen ship began to be unloaded and stored in the Pudong Wharf from 1:00 PM yesterday, ready for sale one after another.</p>
<p>Expanding Warehouses</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau has to spend tens of thousands of yuan on storage and uploading costs for this batch of American cotton. The bureau, with its state-owned status, has obtained the exclusive right to store it. However, because the amount is too large, even though the China Merchants Wharf is large, it is difficult to accommodate it all. Therefore, over 37,000 yuan was spent to rush the renovation of the Yangtze River Wharf and its attached warehouses to store large quantities of American cotton after they are successively transported to Shanghai. In order to facilitate the purchaser's collection, some of the American cotton may need to be stored in the Jin Liyuan Wharf warehouse, so it is necessary to plan in advance. However, the Nan Wharf in the Huangpu River is shallow, and larger ocean-going vessels cannot dock, which will hinder loading and unloading. Therefore, last week, a contract was signed with the Huangpu River Dredging Bureau to dredge and clear the section of the Huangpu River, costing about 20,000 yuan in dredging and clearing expenses. Construction has already begun. This time, the China Merchants Bureau spent a total of 60,000 yuan on repairing and dredging for the sake of storing American cotton, but the income will be several times higher than the expenditure.</p>
<p>Continuing to Arrive</p>
<p>The Fulai Foreign Firm has obtained most of the transportation rights for this shipment of American cotton. Other companies, such as American shipping companies, have also obtained some of the shipping rights. According to the total amount of 4 million bales, at least 150 commercial ships are required to transport them all to Shanghai. The cotton is all in the upper艙 of the New Asia Allied Seaport. The second batch of American cotton to Shanghai is expected to arrive in late October. Large quantities will arrive in November and December. However, this loan of American cotton is different from last year's loan of American wheat, which was specifically for disaster relief. Because of market considerations, the authorities are keeping it secret and do not want to announce the arrival date in advance.</p>
<p>Control Committee</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, Finance Minister Song Ziwen has appointed Chen Guangfu, General Manager of the Shanghai Bank, as the Director of the Cotton Industry Control Committee to address the issues of sales and distribution of American cotton arriving in Shanghai. Chen has considerable connections with the yarn industry and the financial community. This organization has been agreed to by Chen, and preparations are about to begin. At 9:00 AM yesterday, Chen invited relevant figures from the financial and yarn industries to the Shanghai Bank for an informal discussion to exchange ideas on personnel selection and organizational planning. The content has not yet reached the stage of public announcement and will be postponed for the time being. It is known that Chen, in order to avoid past superficial organizations and focus on practical work, the number of committee members will be at most around 15. Its implementation plan, all aspects of improving seeds, cultivating cotton planting, facilitating transportation, ginning and spinning, and even organizing into cloth, transporting and selling, will be under the control and guidance of the Control Committee. The first step has been determined to start with improving seeds and cultivating cotton fields. It is now necessary to wait for the Economic Committee to be reorganized and established next Monday. After the three standing committee members of Wang, Sun, and Song take office, it can be established after a resolution is passed and an order is issued. The date should be in the middle of next week. As for all the internal organizational regulations, they can also be sent to the Legislative Yuan for review and approval soon.</p>
<h3>British-Trained Aviator Cen Delin Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>His Self-Owned Aircraft is Praised Throughout Europe</p>
<p>Plans to Establish an Aviation Society in Shanghai</p>
<p>Will Go Abroad Next Spring to Continue Research</p>
<p>Cen Delin, the fourth son of the late Cen Chunxuan, studied aviation in the United Kingdom and recently graduated from the Hasden Flying School, holding a flying license from the British Royal Air Force. He has traveled and flown in several countries including England, France, and Germany. European newspapers have praised his flying skills, praising him as a young Chinese aviator. Mr. Cen, concerned about the aviation industry in his motherland, departed from Marseille, France on the French mail steamer Cylon 沙輪 a month ago and arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, docking at the China Merchants Bureau Central Wharf. Cen's relatives and friends went to welcome him. This newspaper reporter interviewed Mr. Cen last night. The details of his conversation are as follows.</p>
<p>杰浦锐马斯 Training Aircraft</p>
<p>A Plan to Fly Around the World</p>
<p>Mr. Cen is a young man in his twenties, handsome and energetic. He said that he has always been interested in aviation and is proficient in driving cars. Therefore, he entered the Hasden accelerated flying school in the UK. Within a few months, he was able to fly freely. Although he only has over ninety hours of flying time, he has a deep understanding of ordinary flying techniques. In the future, he will seek training in military aviation. After graduating from aviation school, he planned to fly back to his country alone. Because he had to obtain entry permits from the governments of various countries when passing through them, the procedures were extremely complicated and could not be completed in a short period of time. Therefore, he had no choice but to return to his country first and decided to revisit England next spring to continue his research. In the future, he plans to fly around the world to bring glory to our nation.</p>
<p>He Repeatedly Took Risks with his Self-Purchased Aircraft</p>
<p>I purchased a 杰浦锐马斯 brand biplane training aircraft, worth about 20,000 yuan. This aircraft was originally used by the Prince of Wales of England. The aircraft parts are extremely exquisite. I often drove this aircraft to travel to European countries. I have repeatedly taken risky flights and returned safely. Journalists from various countries competed to interview me and praised me a lot, which I feel very ashamed of.</p>
<p>Establishing Aviation Schools to Train Talents</p>
<p>This time I returned to my country not to become an official, so I am very willing to engage in private aviation in my country. I plan to independently run an aviation club to train flying talents. I plan to open an airfield in western Shanghai and purchase three or four aircraft. Young people who are interested in aviation can register to enroll and train in flying. They can graduate in one or two months. This undertaking is an innovation in China, but it is commonplace overseas. I plan to cross the English Channel again next spring to continue my studies in military aviation technology. I heard that the Chinese Aviation Association's twelve aircraft demonstration will be held soon. At that time, I would like to fly the aircraft to demonstrate and arouse the public's interest in aviation military affairs, etc.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Suspension of Employees on the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>Demanding the Revocation of the Order</p>
<p>The Nanjing employees of the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway, because of the suspension of employees Shen Wangnong, Dai Qi, etc., the Railway Bureau used the pretext that their work performance was mediocre, issuing an order for their suspension, handling perversely. The Fourth District Fifth Branch convened a meeting of members, and held a special meeting of party members on the morning of September 29 (yesterday). It was resolved that the matter concerned the protection of employees' services. Therefore, they plan to submit a petition to the superior party department, the two railway unions, and the departments and teams of the two railways, asking them to forward it to the two railway management bureaus immediately to revoke the order and to seek their unanimous assistance, etc.</p>
<h3>The Chief of Staff of the Garrison Command, Zhang Xiang, is Firmly Resigning</h3>
<p>It is Internally Decided that Zeng Zesheng will Concurrently Serve</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng has decided to go to the Longhua Garrison Command at 10:00 AM on October 2 to concurrently serve as the Acting Songhu Garrison Commander. Because Chief of Staff Zhang Xiang's intention to resign is very firm, it is said that the successor has been internally determined to be Zeng Zesheng, the current Deputy Director of the Municipal Security Office. The position of adjutant general has also been internally determined to be Wen Jiangang, etc.</p>

<h3>Workers at the New Power Company Plant Went on Strike Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Opposing the Company's Dismissal of Workers and Suspension of Pension Payments</p>
<p>The Police Force is Closely Guarding, the Union is Petitioning the Party and Government</p>
<p>Workers Maintaining Power Generation, Old Plant Will Take Concerted Action</p>
<p>The case of the Shanghai Electric Power Company's dismissal of foreman Ni Genfu and others without cause and refusal to pay pension funds has been mediated by party and government agencies and Chinese directors Yuan Ludeng, but because of the company's insistence, it has not been resolved for three months. Unexpectedly, the company's new plant dismissed three workers without cause on the 27th of this month: Xue Abao from the foreign coppersmith shop, Dai Renheng from the workshop department, and Yin Binggen from the No. 3 furnace room, and did not pay the pension funds for dismissed workers in accordance with regulations, causing resentment among all workers.</p>
<p>Negotiations Ineffective. The workers believed that the company had rules stating that if a worker was dismissed, the company should pay 5% of the dismissed worker's full salary as a pension fund. Unexpectedly, the company did not pay in accordance with the regulations, so they sent representatives Sun Helin, Wang Xingen, Weng Xinlong, Hong Qing, Afu, etc., to negotiate with the company the day before yesterday (the 28th), but were rejected by the company, rendering it ineffective.</p>
<p>Complete Strike. At 7:00 AM yesterday morning, all the workers in the new plant entered the plant as usual. However, because the plant did not pay the pension funds to the dismissed workers, the workers were indignant and immediately gathered more than 1,000 workers from various departments, including engines, furnaces, foreign steelworkers, assisting steelworkers, motors, and wiring, and announced a strike. Except for the No. 3 and No. 4 units, which belong to three shifts, the other departments were all suspended.</p>
<p>Imprisoning Workers. After the workers in each department went on strike at the same time, they gathered in the dining room. Unexpectedly, the foreign manager of the furnace room, Hai Ai, suddenly locked the dining room door, preventing workers from entering or leaving. Later, the plant manager, the foreigner Er Men, learned about this and, fearing that it would cause trouble, automatically opened the dining room door. The workers' will was firm and they did not move due to the company's imprisonment, so the order was very good.</p>
<p>Company Announcement. After the workers went on strike, the plant posted a notice stating: "Notice of Workers' Strike. The plant previously dismissed three workers because they had actions outside the rules. Later, another worker resigned for some reason, resulting in the plant being suspected of reducing employees and withholding remuneration for no reason. In fact, this is not the case. No matter who it is, if they are dismissed not because of personal fault or because the plant's work is reduced, they will be given remuneration in accordance with the company's regulations."</p>
<p>All workers must resume work at 1:00 AM today, otherwise they will be dismissed immediately. All vacancies will be filled by finding someone else when necessary. Vice President and General Manager Xue Erde, September 29, 1933, Western Calendar.</p>
<p>Petitioning the Party and Government. At 2:00 PM, the Shanghai Fourth District Water and Electricity Industry Union sent representatives Sun Helin, Wang Xingen, Weng Xinlong, Hong Qing, Afu, etc., to the Municipal Party Department to petition, requesting an immediate investigation and prompt mediation, and ordering the employer to pay the pension funds to the dismissed workers in accordance with regulations. Dai Youheng, a cadre from the Civil Training Section, received them and promised to handle the matter together with the Social Bureau. They then went to the Social Bureau to make the same petition, and mediator Zhu Jintao received them and promised to request instructions and handle the matter.</p>
<p>Notifying Workers. The Fourth District Water and Electricity Union notified the workers: "Workers, recently, the employer has dismissed workers for no reason and swallowed up labor accumulation funds, etc., which have been discovered successively in the new plant. The day before yesterday, worker Xue Abao from the foreign steelworker shop in the new plant was dismissed from work because he had not recovered from his illness and had stopped working for three days, and his twelve years of labor accumulation funds were swallowed up. At the same time, workers Dai Renheng from the workshop department and Yin Binggen from the No. 3 furnace room were both dismissed from work on the pretext of having cause, and their labor accumulation funds for many years of service were also swallowed up. Yesterday, all the workers in the new plant sent representatives to the plant manager, the foreigner Er Men, to demand that the dismissed workers be paid labor accumulation funds. Unexpectedly, the plant manager refused to pay on the pretext of the company's newly established regulations, and said that no matter how many years they worked in the plant, they would not be paid, and the attitude was strong, so the demand was ineffective. Workers, the employer is so barbaric, ignoring the suffering of the workers, and wants to implement his plan to reduce Chinese workers and deliberately swallow up the labor accumulation funds accumulated by the workers over the years. This kind of oppression has now been tested in the new plant. If he is allowed to test in the two plants and does not plan to unite to deal with it, all 2,000 workers will have the possibility of being oppressed and exploited. I hope that all my workers will strengthen their unity. If the employer oppresses us for no reason in the future, we will unite to fight together. In the future, the final victory will belong to us."</p>
<p>Workers Meeting. After the plant's announcement was posted, it was torn down by the workers, who firmly refused to resume work. At 3:38 PM, more than 1,000 striking workers discussed the countermeasures in the dining room and decided: (1) Strictly maintain order and do not take any outside actions; (2) If the plant wants to drive them away by force, they will never resist; (3) Each will go home after work; (4) Go to the plant as usual tomorrow. If the plant refuses to let them in, they will decide on a course of action.</p>
<p>Maintaining Power Generation. After the new plant went on strike, the workers realized that the power supply was very important for traffic and local security. In order to maintain public order, the three-shift workers of the No. 3 and No. 4 units of the new plant, that is, the power generation workers, continued to work as usual in three shifts every day. Therefore, the workers' strike did not affect the power supply in the Public Concession. However, if the strike dispute is prolonged, the work of the three-shift workers will attract the attention of all sectors of society. Therefore, the citizens of this city hope that the power company will not stick to its prejudices and seek a peaceful solution to the strike as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Police Guard. After all the workers went on strike in the morning, the plant notified the Yangshupu Police Station by telephone, asking the police to suppress them. Upon receiving the report, the police station immediately dispatched a large number of armed detectives and plainclothes detectives, divided into six cars, totaling about 100 people, who were distributed in the plant and on Dongting Road. They were withdrawn after the striking workers left the plant at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Old Labor Payment Example. According to the dismissed worker Xue Abao, the reporter from the New Voice News Agency said that the usual salary of workers per year is 100 yuan. Those who have completed one year of employment after being dismissed will be given a pension of five yuan, and more will be added accordingly. I have worked for twelve years, Dai Renheng for four years, and Yin Binggen for six and a half years. The company recently promulgated new regulations on pension funds, giving one week of pay per year and one and a half weeks for three years. However, the union has not yet approved these regulations, and now the company has dismissed me and others without giving anything, causing opposition from all workers. It is heard that the old plant will also take concerted action. However, the new plant has hired more than 40 White Russians today (yesterday). It is inferred that its intention is to resist the actions of the workers.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association Replied to Various Organizations on the Miscalculated Telephone Price Increase</h3>
<p>Too Much Equipment, Too Little Capital, Too Sudden a Price Increase</p>
<p>Unaware of Economic Conditions, Unfamiliar with Our National Conditions</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association sent separate letters to the Shanghai First Special District and Second Special District Citizens' Federation, Shanghai Nanjing Road Business Federation, Sima Road Business Federation, Municipal Federation District Branch, and the Twentieth District Branch regarding the telephone company's price increase. The reply stated: "We have received your letter regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's price increase. Upon investigation, we learned that the Shanghai Telephone Company is planning to increase prices again. Our association was aware of this matter long ago and is studying the content, observing public opinion, and the measures taken by the Public Concession's Bureau of Works in order to seek proposals that are suitable for the social economy. According to the company, the proposed increase is one-fifth to one-quarter of the current price. If implemented, the annual cost of residential telephones, which was 52 taels before the increase last year, will be 81 taels and 25 cents per year (assuming another increase of one-quarter, the same below). The annual cost of business telephones, which was 78 taels before the increase last year, will be 131 taels and 25 cents per year. The former will increase by 28 taels and 25 cents, and the latter will increase by 53 taels and 25 cents. Users are unable to bear this burden in the current declining market, and their cooperative opposition is a reasonable move. In our opinion, the Shanghai Telephone Company is losing money every year. Its repeated requests for price increases are understandable, but this is due to its own miscalculations. First, the equipment is too extensive. Second, the capital is too small. Third, the price increase is too sudden. Fourth, it is unaware of the social economic conditions. Fifth, it is unfamiliar with our national temperament. Upon investigation, the Shanghai Telephone Company has 100,000 telephone lines, but only 40,000 are actually in use. Anyone with commercial knowledge knows that this is not enough to avoid losses. This is the first point. Second, with a business worth over 20 million taels, the capital is only 5.75 million taels. The remainder is obtained from 5 million taels of company bonds and other loans for operations. If the number of users increases, and the number of installed lines is not far off, there will be room for improvement. However, the income is not increasing naturally, and the interest on the debt, which cannot be stopped, must be paid. It is difficult not to seek artificial price increases to make up for the shortfall. This is the second point. If the price increase is not immediate after the automatic machine is fully installed, communication will be convenient, and more people will install it. An increase of 10,000 residential users will increase the company's annual income by 520,000 taels. An increase of 10,000 business users will increase the annual income by 780,000 taels. Although the number of users increases, the expenditure will increase, but the two will offset each other, and there will be profits without losses. Unexpectedly, the company did not see this, and the price increase occurred after the Japanese disturbances in Shanghai. People who want to install will be even more hesitant. This is the third point. Shanghai's social economy is the best in China compared to other cities, but it is still far from London and New York. However, the reports are made by British and the telephones are handled by Americans. Their observations are inevitably wrong. This is the fourth point. Moreover, Americans have a fast-paced mentality, while our national temperament is more leisurely. Compared to the need for telephones, the degree of need is very different. Americans use their own mentality to measure our national temperament, which is naturally incompatible. This is the fifth point. If the company's understanding is wrong again, and the Bureau of Works, forgetting its position, approves the price increase due to insufficient understanding, users will passively refuse to use or reduce the use of telephones because the need and cost are not commensurate. Moreover, the two telephone organizations refuse to cancel the five-cent call fee, like the Shanghai Telephone, and use the contract to resist. Its users are already in an atmosphere of unspoken anger. Once a large price increase is made, the company's pursuit of profit will be self-defeating. From a legal point of view, according to the contract signed between the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Bureau of Works in 1930, there are the following four points: First, during the renovation period, the fees will be collected according to the old price of the China Foreign General Law Feng Company. Second, after the renovation of the automatic machine is completed, the price will be increased according to the number in Ansen's report. Third, the price cannot be increased again within three years after the increase. Fourth, after the three-year period expires, the price can be increased appropriately, to the extent that the income is sufficient to pay 8% of the dividend and 2% of the public accumulation fund. From this point of view, the Bureau of Works can reject the company's request this time with the words "should not be discussed" based on the third point above. However, with the exception of the Bureau of Works' limit on the deadline for the company to renovate the cross-border telephones last year, it was approved to increase the price, and it was allowed to destroy the universally recognized principle of (the law does not apply retroactively), tracing back to March 27 of last year. It is inevitable that the public will have doubts about the Bureau of Works' attitude towards the telephone company's request for another price increase and will be horrified. In fact, although telephones are a convenient tool for communication, they are different from water. It is said that the telephone company wants to equate it with tap water and other powerful precedents for price increases. Our association believes that this is very unwise. In response to the letter, we are sending a reply and hope that you will take it into consideration."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to Foreign Chambers of Commerce Requesting Discretionary Compensation for Disaster Areas</h3>
<p>Because the insurance companies insisted on not paying for the insurance in the Zhabei war zone, many incidents of injured claimants have occurred. The policyholders have petitioned the Municipal Chamber of Commerce again. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the insurance industry association and foreign chambers of commerce in England, America, Denmark, Norway, France, and Germany, requesting that they inform the insurance companies to provide discretionary compensation. The original letter is as follows: "We are writing to you to inquire about the fire insurance claims in the Zhabei disaster area of the city last year. The policyholders have repeatedly requested that the insurance companies consider and compensate them, but there has been no solution to date. Even this month, more than 100 policyholders went to the Aidoa Road Fongsheng Insurance Company and the Tianxiang Foreign Firm Insurance Department on Wuma Road to appeal for compensation, but they were instigated by the police to interfere and turned into a tragic case of expulsion and assault, causing public outrage and a tendency for the situation to escalate. On the 29th of this month, hundreds of policyholders suddenly came to the association with their men, women, old and young to ask for help. The situation was urgent. After persuasion on the spot, they all dispersed. However, this case has been deadlocked for a long time. Weighing the facts fairly, the policyholders have paid premiums and insured in the past, and it is a legal right to claim compensation for the disaster. Insisting on not resolving it is not in the interests of both parties. We are sending this letter to inform you of the situation. We hope that your association will take note of this and quickly inform the insurance companies to consider the difficult situation of the policyholders and provide appropriate compensation to avoid escalating the situation. We are deeply grateful to the Shanghai Chinese Insurance Industry Association and foreign chambers of commerce."</p>

<h3>Record of the Monthly Meeting of the Returned Students Association from America</h3>
<p>Last night at 7:30 PM, the Shanghai Returned Students Association from America held a dinner meeting at the New YMCA, attended by over a hundred people. The meeting was presided over by Li Zhao Huan, President of Jiaotong University (due to the absence of the president, Mu Ouchu). During the meeting, Lord Marley, the chairman of the Anti-War Association and the British representative, former Secretary of War of the British Labour Government, was invited to give a speech on the value of education. Lord Marley's attitude was sincere and his words were interesting, which moved the audience. Lord Marley first stated that modern education is funded by the wealthy. As a result, it is nominally democratized, but in reality, it is manipulated by the wealthy, making education a tool of the bourgeoisie. Lord Marley continued to describe the tragic impression he gained from visiting the homes of poor people in Shanghai, such as ten people living in a small, dirty boat. In this situation, on the one hand, we should promote birth control, and on the other hand, we should also transform the politics that cause this tragedy without improvement. Lord Marley repeatedly pointed out that those who have studied or traveled abroad have a special responsibility to correct the mistakes of Western industrialism. Lord Marley believes that there are countless young people in China today who are willing to fight for the ideal of transforming politics and society, even at the cost of sacrificing everything. This spirit of courage is admirable. Finally, he hoped that there would be organizations to guide foreigners traveling to China in the future, so that they could understand the real situation in China and not just get a superficial impression. After Lord Marley left, the chairman invited Mrs. Liu Zhanen, Wang Liming, who is enthusiastic about social service and promoting women's movements, to give a speech on the importance of the women's movement, saying that the status of a country always depends on the status of women in the country. At present, there are 60,000 to 100,000 prostitutes in Shanghai, all because rural farmers are driven by economic hardship. Urban women are indulging in pleasure and laziness, which is shameful. They should go to the countryside to promote social undertakings, but this cannot be done without the assistance of men. Mrs. Liu's remarks were sharp, and the men present were quite educated. Finally, each committee reported on the association's affairs. The association will have at least one gathering every month in the future. Those who have not received a notice can quickly send their name and address to the association's secretary at Post Office Box 433.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Convened a Meeting of Silk Manufacturers Yesterday</h3>
<p>Develop Foreign Trade</p>
<p>Establish Inspection Agencies</p>
<p>Actively Improve Products</p>
<p>The International Trade Bureau, in order to develop foreign silk trade, convened a meeting of representatives from various silk factories in the city at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon in the conference room on the fourth floor of the bureau. It was decided to establish silk export inspection agencies and send personnel to promote overseas, among other important issues. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Factories Attending: Yesterday, Cai Shengbai from Meiya Factory, Qian from Yuzhou Factory, Cai Tingtao from Damei Factory, Wei Jiahui from Meifeng Factory, Wang Shiqiang from Jinyun Factory, Guo Limao, Dong Helin from Xingye Factory, Wang Qinsun from Dawei Factory, Xuan Guisen from Shixin Factory, Chen Ziyi from Jinlong Factory, Jin Deqing from Zhenye Factory, Xu Limin from Qingcheng Factory, Lou Fengbu from the Silk Industry Association, and more than ten others attended. Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Section of the International Trade Bureau, presided over the meeting, and Zhang Pansun recorded the minutes. First, the chairman delivered a speech, and then the meeting began, adjourning at 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Key Points of Discussion: The International Trade Bureau prepared the following key points for discussion: (1) Standardization Issues: Chinese products have never had uniform standards. The length and width measurements often vary. The silk weaving is uneven, and the thickness is inconsistent. For example, if a certain item is priced at a certain amount and labeled in a certain way, the length, width, and thickness of the first batch of goods will often be inconsistent with the second batch. (2) Color Issues: Most of China's silk exports are natural colors. Some are dyed or printed, but the patterns are outdated and lack aesthetic appeal. As a result, sales are stagnant. In addition to men's shirts, silk should be dyed and have novel patterns for women's summer dresses and children's shirts and pants to suit Western tastes. If the dyed color fades in water and the printed patterns are vulgar, then natural colors are preferable. (3) Thickness Issues: Most of China's silk is thick and heavy. Foreign women prefer thin silk, with light materials being the best. Therefore, Chinese silk is not popular when shipped overseas. (4) Price Issues: The average price of silk sold by foreign merchants is highest for French goods, followed by Chinese goods, and lowest for Japanese goods. French goods are exquisite and beautiful. Although the price is high, the market is still good. However, Chinese goods are inferior to Japanese goods in terms of quality and color, and the price is higher. It is difficult to compete with Japanese goods. (5) Appropriate Length: The length of each piece of Chinese silk can be determined by itself, with a limit of 25 yards for short lengths and 50 yards for long lengths. However, there should be a certain standard for the width. Currently, the width of incoming goods is 32 inches or 33 inches, which is not suitable for tailoring. According to reports from British merchants, 36 inches is considered the most suitable. Chinese silk merchants should pay close attention to this point. The reason is probably that Chinese products are based on Chinese clothing tailoring methods and do not take into account foreign women's clothing tailoring methods. Because the width is insufficient, more materials must be cut, which is not economical. This is why customers abandon Chinese goods and seek Japanese goods. (6) Advertising and Promotion: Advertising is an essential tool for commerce in the modern century. Chinese merchants abroad do not have strong capital or advertising skills. It is impossible to compete with those who use tens of millions of capital for advertising and promotion. Advertising and promotion should aim at low prices and novel colors. Chinese silk merchants engaged in foreign trade may consider raising some funds and hiring famous British and American fashion illustrators to write small booklets of six to ten pages, reprint them in color, note English and French, and give them to British and American merchants operating Chinese silk goods to attract business. (7) Direct Trade: Goods shipped from China to foreign countries are transferred to the market through import and export merchants. The price is inevitably high after several transfers. Sometimes, Chinese silk merchants are monopolized by foreign merchants or foreign firms, and it is difficult to understand foreign market conditions and needs. Regarding this point, the only way to remedy it is for Chinese merchants to quickly plan direct trade methods, send letters to consulates in various places to request the introduction of foreign firms, and communicate directly to reduce sales prices and promote sales.</p>
<p>Resolutions: (1) Standardization and (2) Color Issues were merged and resolved that the government and merchants should cooperate to establish silk export inspection agencies. (3) Silk Thickness was resolved that silk factories should actively improve it. (4) Silk Price was resolved that the government should refund the import tax on rayon when rayon and silk mixed products are exported to reduce the cost of merchants. The merchants should present a request. (5) Silk Length: In addition to Shandong silk, silk has been woven to a width of 36 inches to 40 inches. It was resolved to notify silk factories to reform. (6) Overseas Promotion was resolved that the government and merchants should cooperate to organize and send personnel to promote overseas every year, starting in Southeast Asia and South America. As for the United Kingdom and the United States, it is currently difficult to develop. Direct Trade was resolved that due to financial problems, no one in China is willing to put up funds, and there is no bank trust. At present, in the transitional era, we should first cultivate the soundness of overseas Chinese financial institutions, and then, when there are foreign trade matters in China, each merchant should jointly organize an agency to achieve the purpose of direct foreign trade. Ad Hoc Motions: (1) Annam Increasing Import Tax: The reason is that Annam is a market for Chinese silk sales. Since the increase in import tax, Chinese silk sales have disappeared. It was resolved that the government should be asked to negotiate for relief. (2) Establishment of a Silk Testing Institute: The reason is that all the machines in the factories are very old and are foreign machines from 20 years ago. Although merchants want to improve, they lack the ability. It was resolved that the government should subsidize the establishment of a silk testing institute as a standard for each silk factory.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sent a Letter to the Public Works Department Regarding the Inland Business Tax, Requesting Calculation Based on the Actual Amount of Pledges</h3>
<p>Should Not Use the Year with the Highest Business as the Standard for Tax Collection</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Public Works Department, which stated: "We are writing to inform you that on the 28th of this month, we received a letter from the Pawnbrokers Association of this city, stating that the Public Works Department of the Public Concession has been collecting pawnbroker business license fees at the end of each quarter, checking the amount of pledges, and collecting 2/1000 of the amount. The amount of tax paid depends on the prosperity of the business. Although the tax rate is higher, the principle is still fair. However, since the summer of 1920, the Public Works Department suddenly eliminated the procedure of checking the amount of pledges and selected the year with the highest business in the past as the standard. It still changed the fee to a graded system based on the ratio of 2/1000. At that time, the department repeatedly stated that if business increased or decreased in the future, the established grades could be changed. The eleventh clause on the licenses issued by the department states that the department would check the accounts in the shop every three months to know the business scope and to determine the tax rate difference. However, since the change of regulations, the market has been deteriorating, and the business of each pawnbroker has plummeted. The sharp reduction in pledges is unprecedented. However, the Public Works Department still uses the year with the highest business as the standard for tax payment without any reduction. Therefore, lawyer Gong Yaxian was entrusted to request the Public Works Department to quickly restore the original regulations of checking the amount of pledges to reduce the extra burden. At first, it was thought that this request was in line with the original regulations of the department, and it would definitely be approved. However, it was rejected. Then, each pawnbroker reported the exact amount of pledges and tax paid for the three years and one quarter from the date of the change of regulations to the summer of this year and made a table comparing the general situation twice. The table was forwarded to the Public Works Department through the Chinese Taxpayers Association for review, stating that each pawnbroker was suffering losses due to the impact of the market downturn and was unable to bear the huge tax burden. It was requested that the overpaid tax of 10,790 yuan be deducted from the winter season, and the insufficient amount of tax to be paid in the future would be supplemented to maintain the business. It was hoped that the Public Works Department would show sympathy for the truth of the losses. More than a month has passed, but no result has been obtained, causing great concern among the members. After a meeting, it was decided that if the Public Works Department still does not give a satisfactory reply, starting from the winter season, the overpaid tax will be secretly used to offset the tax, and all payments will be stopped. Even if they are forced to stop business, they will not hesitate. The situation is serious, and the association is deeply concerned. Therefore, we are writing to inform your association for review and promptly forward the letter to the Public Works Department to clarify the current difficulties and urgency of the members of the association, so as to achieve the purpose of restoring the original regulations and stabilizing their livelihoods. We are anxiously awaiting your instructions." After arriving at the meeting, it was found that the pawnshop business license fee has always been based on the amount of pledges in each quarter as the standard for collecting fees. This method ensures that the pawnshop does not secretly suffer losses and is relatively fair. Since the summer of 1920, the procedure of investigating the amount of pledges was suddenly omitted, and the amount of business in the past year was used as the standard. If the business is not equally prosperous, the average of each year should be calculated, and the most prosperous year should not be used as the standard. Your department also knows that this method is not perfect, so there is a statement that the established grades can be changed if business increases or decreases in the future. Since your department has this promise, you should abide by it and make it effective. Moreover, it is claimed that the clause in the license stipulates that accounts will be checked every three months to determine the tax rate difference. This clause has not been changed, so this clause is still valid. Since the method was changed in the summer of 1920, it has been three years. The business of this industry has declined, and the amount of tax exceeding the amount of pledges is about 9,000 yuan, according to the summary table submitted to your department for review last time. Even in the summer of this year, it has been overcharged by more than 1,400 yuan. All of these are the losses secretly suffered by the industry. Since your department previously stated that the grades can be changed if business increases or decreases in the future, the repeated requests of the association should not be ignored. Even in terms of customs duties, those that are collected based on the value of the goods also have the right to request a re-evaluation when prices fall. The pawnshop business license fee is based on the amount of pledges, which is the same reason as the right to request a re-evaluation of customs duties. We hope that your department will approve the association's request and continue to collect fees in proportion to the actual amount of pledges in each quarter, and that the amount overpaid in the past will be used to offset the winter fee. This is extremely important."</p>

The other two robbers went upstairs to search and rob. They left after about 20 minutes. It is estimated that they robbed over 1,000 yuan worth of cash, jewelry, and clothing. Afterwards, the victim reported to the Songshan Road Police Station for investigation.</p>

<h3>Judge Liu Yugui Hates Evil Merchants Like Poison</h3>
<p>Instructions That the Case of Japanese Yarn Impersonating Domestic Goods Must Not Be Arbitrarily Dismissed</p>
<p>If Shenxin Wants to Withdraw the Lawsuit, It Must Obtain the Prosecutor's Consent</p>
<p>If the Ten Evil Merchants Continue to Ignore the Summons, Arrest Warrants Will Be Issued</p>
<p>丨Judge Liu's Spirit of Upholding National Laws and Discipline is Admirable丨</p>
<p>The ten factories, including the Gongzu Socks Factory, Sanyang Cotton Weaving Factory, Jiuyi Weaving Factory, Dingxin Cloth Factory, Yudong Socks Factory, Junchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yunzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yongyuan Mercerizing Factory, Yixing Company, and Tonghe Dyeing and Weaving Factory, have long been engaged in selling Japanese goods. Since the outbreak of the Japanese invasion of Northeast China, the Chinese people have risen up to save the nation and unanimously boycott enemy goods. These ten factories, only knowing how to seek profit, do not hesitate to degrade their character and still sell enemy goods on a large scale. Fearing that they would be exposed and intolerable to the public, they changed the Japanese cotton yarn, repackaged it, impersonated Shenxin Fifth Factory's Ren Zhong brand, forged tax invoices, and deceived the tax authorities to transport the goods. This kind of trick not only harms Shenxin, but also deceives the government.</p>
<p>Later, after the Su, Zhejiang and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau found out, it informed Shenxin Fifth Factory to send personnel to investigate and clarify. Then the manager of the factory, Rong Weiren, hired lawyer Sun Zuji to file a criminal lawsuit against the evil merchants Yu Xifan, Chen Zhongxian, Wang Sanwei, Sun Xintan, Yu Yuxin, Zhou Songmao, Chai Zhixiang, Zhao Bingnan, Wang Gengen, Guan Bingchu, etc., requesting that they be punished according to law and compensate for the loss of</p>
<p>200,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The First Special District Court had already held a hearing once. Because all the defendants were afraid of being guilty and did not appear, it was postponed. However, the evil merchants knew that this matter was already despised by the public. If they were to be sanctioned by national law, they would have nowhere to hide. Therefore, they asked Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaolai to mediate with Shenxin. Shenxin also expressed its acceptance. The details have been reported in yesterday's newspaper. However, although Shenxin has rumored that the ten factories will provide funds to the Yellow River flood relief association as relief funds and no other requests have been made,</p>
<p>There Are Different Rumors</p>
<p>Therefore, the attitude of both parties during yesterday's court hearing is worth noting and can be said to be a measure of the extent to which the case has been settled after mediation. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM was the date for the continued hearing, which was still presided over by Judge Liu Yugui in the Second Criminal Court. Unexpectedly, the defendants still ignored the summons and did not appear. Only the defense lawyers of the defendants appeared in court and requested a further postponement, saying that there was still a possibility of settlement between the two parties. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer, Sun Zuji, also stood up and said that since the plaintiff has filed a lawsuit in this case, it should wait patiently for</p>
<p>A Legal Solution</p>
<p>At the same time, the defendants will inevitably face the sanctions of national law. As for the settlement, because the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has taken the initiative to mediate, it is inconvenient to refuse. Moreover, they are even more afraid that the consequences of the case for the defendants will be unimaginable. Therefore, the plaintiff is still considering the settlement. However, the defendant's request for a postponement seems acceptable. At that time, Judge Liu immediately declared after learning the above situation: "After examining the ordinary cases, if a settlement can be reached, the lawsuit can be withdrawn from this court. However, this case is of great importance and cannot be compared with ordinary cases. Once a lawsuit is filed, it cannot be arbitrarily dismissed. Even if this case can be settled, the plaintiff intends to withdraw the lawsuit from this court, then this court must also</p>
<p>Seek the Prosecutor's</p>
<p>Opinion or consent, which the parties cannot freely decide. At the same time, in the two court hearings of this case, all the defendants failed to appear in court, which is a contempt for the dignity of this court and a desecration of national laws and discipline. Now, this court will grant a further postponement, and the retrial is scheduled for 2:00 PM on October 7. At that time, the defendant's lawyer immediately stood up and said that the defender happened to be traveling to Tongzhou around October 7 and requested the court to postpone the date of the retrial to after October 10. Judge Liu rejected this and declared that this case had been delayed for a long time and repeatedly requested for postponement, which resulted in a lack of thorough hearing. Therefore, only advancement is allowed,</p>
<p>No Delay Allowed</p>
<p>The court then approved the postponement to 2:00 PM on October 6 for retrial. This court will issue another summons to the defendants to appear in court. The defendant's lawyer must inform the defendants of the court's intention and must surrender to the court for hearing. If they dare to defy again, this court will issue arrest warrants to maintain the rule of law. The defense lawyer reluctantly withdrew. At the same time, it was learned that the Unified Tax Office had prepared the procedures for the case and intended to file a lawsuit immediately. Yesterday, during the court hearing, the office employee,</p>
<p>Mr. Ling Yin Song</p>
<p>Was present to listen to the hearing. At the same time, the number of people from all walks of life who came to the hearing was overwhelming, which shows the importance of the case to the public. The address and manager of the evil merchants who impersonated domestic goods with Japanese yarn are now recorded as follows: Gongzu Socks Factory, No. 20 Binlang Road, Public Concession, Yu Xifan; Sanyang Cotton Weaving Factory, No. 138 Gongguan Road, French Concession, Chen Zhongxian; Jiuyi Socks Factory, No. 256 Fuli Road, French Concession, Wang Liwei; Shengxin Cloth Factory, No. 720 Lujiabang outside Dananmen, Nanshi, Sun Xinzu; Yudong Socks Factory, No. 160 Yuandeli, Lanweiai Road, French Concession, Yu Yuxin; Junchang Weaving Factory, No. 415 Hede Road, Public Concession, Zhou Songmao; Yunzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factory, No. 42 Dawangmiao Lane, Lujiabang, Nanshi, Chai Zhixiang; Yongyuan Mercerizing Factory, No. 20 Zhilu branch road, Ximen Xieqiao Xu Road, Zhao Bingnan; Yixing Company, Fengli, Laozha Bridge Temple, Public Concession, Wang Gengen; Tongzhi Dyeing and Weaving Factory, No. 3 Guling Road, Public Concession, Guan Bingqing.</p>
<h3>Gasoline Competition: Merger Between Two American Companies</h3>
<p>With Political Implications</p>
<p>A local oil industry insider told a reporter for the Continental Press yesterday that after the merger of Socony Vacuum Corporation and Standard Oil Company of New Jersey (both companies represented by Mobil in Shanghai), their operations in the Far East would be combined into one. This would place them in a position to compete with other oil companies in the Far East. However, the source did not explicitly state whether this move by the American company was solely to counter the threat of Soviet Russian oil, which is prevalent everywhere, or whether it would also be directed against the Asiatic Petroleum Company. He merely suggested that one should observe for themselves. However, the Asiatic Petroleum Company is unwilling to concede its dominance in the Far East oil market and expressed this yesterday. Immediately after receiving news of the merger of the two American companies, it announced a further reduction of five cents per gallon in the retail price of Shell gasoline, selling it for only seventy cents. However, this price war may be limited to Shanghai. Asiatic Petroleum Company's supply of gasoline and kerosene comes from Java and Borneo, which are conveniently located nearby. Soviet Russia, on the other hand, must transport its oil from the Black Sea, and Mobil's oil fields are also located far from Shanghai. However, the low cost of labor in Soviet Russia can offset the disadvantage of transportation costs. Now that the two American companies have merged, they can draw supplies from Sumatra, making transportation convenient and allowing them to compete on an equal footing. However, according to the source, the current situation, while suggesting the imminent outbreak of a major gasoline and kerosene war in the Far East, may actually stabilize the Far East market due to the merger of the two American companies. Knowing that the American companies now have a big stick in their hand, the British and Russians may opt for a truce. It is also anticipated that this move by the two companies will have political repercussions, which will become more apparent when the United States considers recognizing Soviet Russia, as it will give the United States a significant advantage in negotiations.</p>
<h3>Female Protagonist of the Dalian Suitcase Murder Case Commits Suicide by Poison</h3>
<p>| A suicide note reveals the truth behind the murder |</p>
<p>Osaka, 29th (China United Press) - Mrs. Katsumi Kodama, the female protagonist of the Dalian suitcase murder case, was found by Japanese police today at Mount Koya. It is reported that Mrs. Katsumi committed suicide by poisoning. Her suicide note stated that she had a physical relationship with the deceased, Aoyagi, which began in mid-February of the previous year due to forced adultery and continued until the present day. Dr. Kodama only learned of this on that day. On the day of the murder, Aoyagi brought four or five gangsters to harm Nakazono and Katsumi, which led to the incident. Kodama was not involved in the case. According to the Japanese police, Dr. Kodama's statements varied each time, and there was no evidence of accomplices. (Another Telegram) Nakazono and Katsumi, a couple, arrived at the Hokuroku Betsuin Temple on Mount Koya, Wakayama Prefecture, on the 26th, falsely claiming to be from Kobe City. Knowing that escape was impossible, they planned a love suicide. Nakazono wrote a confession, admitting the truth behind the murder. The Japanese police searched Mrs. Katsumi's handbag and found his confession and ten yuan in banknotes. The two took poison last night, but the dosage was too light. They were discovered this morning and rushed to the hospital for emergency treatment. Nakazono Hideo has regained consciousness and is currently detained at the Koyasan Police Station. Nakazono has fully confessed to the Japanese police. Katsumi has not yet recovered and is still receiving treatment at the Hokuroku Betsuin Temple. It is reported that the Shahekou Police Station in Dalian has dispatched detectives to Wakayama Prefecture today to escort the two murderers. From the murder on September 6th to their arrest today, twenty-four days have passed, which is six days after Kodama surrendered himself.</p>
<h3>Policeman Owing Over a Thousand Dollars Embezzles Police Pay and Flees</h3>
<p>Chen Ruxuan, Police Officer, Promoted Beyond His Rank</p>
<p>The Result Is Truly Absurd</p>
<p>| The Public Security Bureau Chief Should Be Held Responsible for Negligence |</p>
<p>Chen Ruxuan, a policeman from Tianjin and the head of the police station stationed at the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory in Lujiazui, the third district of the Pudong Public Security Bureau, first served as a policeman in that district in 1926. Because of his diligence, he was appreciated by District Chief Zhang Mingqin, who recommended him to the bureau for promotion to third-class policeman. He was promoted gradually until he reached the rank of first-class police chief. The police team stationed at the Xiang Sheng Factory was under the command of Chen. The factory's monthly police pay was also given to Chen to forward to the Public Security Bureau, which then distributed it to the district for verification and disbursement. The factory authorities were preparing to pay the police pay, a sum of over one hundred dollars.</p>
<h3>Jiang Minsheng Donates His Earnings to the Refugee Relief Association Again</h3>
<p>A Total of Twelve Dollars and Fifty Cents This Month</p>
<p>Also Donates Ten Dollars Each to Female Refugees in Tianjin and Comrades</p>
<p>Jiang Minsheng, a hero of the resistance against Japan, has been working as a shoe shiner for two months to support himself. Yesterday, Jiang donated all his earnings from August 25th to September 24th, totaling twelve dollars and fifty cents, along with a letter, to the Northeastern Refugee Relief Association. The reporter happened to be at the association's Northeastern branch and spoke with Jiang, who was animated and spirited, discussing national affairs and social issues at length. The following is a summary:</p>
<p>Jiang Minsheng's Statement</p>
<p>During the May Fourth Movement, I gathered comrades in Harbin to confront Japan. We had many comrades. When the country faced a crisis, we would gather to work for the country. When it was over, we would disperse and return to our former occupations. I used to work in a Japanese coal mine in the Northeast, spying on the Japanese. Our comrades included people in the press and education sectors. When I was in Harbin, I set up an advertising agency and a small school. When the September 18th Incident occurred, our group of comrades gathered to plan resistance efforts, contacting bandit heroes Ma Zhanshan, Li Du, and Wang Delin. I participated in the anti-Japanese war. Jiang sighed, saying that the country's situation was hopeless and that we could only wait for the right time. We must confront Japan and never soften. He then sadly added that there were fifty to sixty thousand refugees from Tianjin, Northeast China, who could not support themselves and were forced to move inland. Women were even forced into prostitution, which was very distressing. One of my students is now equipped with shoe-shining tools, and I recently instructed him to take up this trade. I remember that Harbin had a population of over 300,000, and there were over 200 shoe shiners. Shanghai has a population of over 3,000,000, so there should be at least 1,000 shoe shiners. Shanghai did not have this trade before. It only exists because of me. I have opened up a new occupation for the unemployed, which can be a way to alleviate unemployment.</p>
<p>Attached is the original letter</p>
<p>Respected Sirs, I have been receiving assistance from your association for two months now, and I have been working as a shoe shiner for two months. I submitted a report at the end of last month. I should write a letter of thanks and report on my work this month. From August 25th to September 24th, including the money and items sold from last month's savings and my earnings, I earned a total of 53 dollars and 70 cents. After deducting 41 dollars and 20 cents for expenses, I saved 12 dollars and 50 cents, which I am donating to your association to help Northeastern refugees. I am also submitting a report on my expenses. After a reporter found out about the information in last month's report, it was published in major newspapers, and I received countless letters and telegrams of support from compatriots at home and abroad, as well as personal visits. I have been interviewed by reporters from major newspapers and news agencies in Shanghai almost every day. I have received letters and telegrams of support from over ten provinces. The news has been published in over one hundred newspapers in various places, and even newspapers in Europe and Asia have published it, which shows that there is sympathy from both China and abroad. I am still ashamed. Today, I received a letter from Tianjin from a girl named Wang Chunyang and her mother, Wang Li, who are starving in Tianjin. According to their letter, they are from Tieling County, Liaoning Province, and her father and brother were also anti-Japanese comrades who died in the fires of the Japanese military. The mother and daughter fled to the interior and were rescued by the Kailuan Mining Bureau Temporary Relief Association in Tianjin. The orphaned girl and widow are stranded in Tianjin and are asking for help. I feel sorry for them because their father and brother were comrades who saved the country, and I cannot bear to watch their suffering. I have sent the ten dollars I saved in the post office last month to help them temporarily. I have also asked them to seek assistance from charitable organizations in Tianjin. I am attaching Wang's original letter and my reply for your reference. I am also submitting a detailed list of my expenses below: (Expenses) Ten dollars for Wang Chunyang, ten dollars for a comrade to return to the Northeast to work, four dollars and ninety cents for shoe polish, two dollars and fifty cents for books and newspapers, one dollar and fifty cents for postage, eighty cents for stationery, one dollar for an old pair of shoes, seven dollars and fifty cents for tea and cigarettes, three dollars for miscellaneous expenses, and twelve dollars and fifty cents donated to your association, totaling fifty-three dollars and seventy cents. (Income) Thirteen pairs of shoelaces donated by the China Shoe Material Joint-Stock Company's belt factory, earning one dollar and fifty cents, two boxes of shoe polish donated by Tan Guinan, which were bought by Yu Guangyu for one dollar, thirty-seven dollars and twenty cents from shoe-shining, and fourteen dollars from last month's savings, totaling fifty-three dollars and seventy cents. The income and expenses balance. When compatriots offered congratulations, some gave cash, but I declined because I did not deserve it. This month, your association gave me two sets of white shirts, two sets of single Western-style suits, one set of lined Western-style suits, and one quilt. I am very grateful and am writing this letter to thank you. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Federation for Northeastern Refugees, from Jiang Minsheng, September 27th.</p>
<p>Over a hundred dollars, which was given to Chen to distribute. However, Chen suddenly disappeared. The policemen did not suspect anything at first. When Chen did not return that night, they knew that something was wrong and reported it to District Chief Zhang for verification. District Chief Zhang immediately sent people to search for him, but he was nowhere to be found. After Chen ran away with the police pay, over ten creditors reported to the Third District, claiming that they were owed money or loans that had not been repaid, totaling over one thousand dollars. This further confirmed that Chen was unable to stand his ground and had risked everything to embezzle the money and flee. In addition to the creditors, the victims also included the ten policemen stationed at the factory, as their monthly pay was now lost. District Chief Zhang has submitted a report to the bureau for arrest and has also requested instructions from the headquarters on how to provide relief to the victimized policemen.</p>
<h3>Shanghai South Launches Public Buses</h3>
<p>Planned to be Operated by the Xingye Trust Company</p>
<p>Since the suspension of public bus services in Shanghai South, although trams still operate, transportation has become extremely inconvenient. Therefore, merchants and residents such as Li Xiaocang have submitted a request to start a new bus service. The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau has proposed that the Xingye Trust Company operate the service. However, some say that the Xingye Trust Company is already involved in many businesses, so this matter may still be contracted out to private companies.</p>

<p>The directors of the Yinjiang Shellac Cooperative of Ningbo Yinxian came to Shanghai to mediate with the Pharmaceutical Association</p>
<p>Members of the Yinjiang Shellac Transport and Sales Cooperative in Yin County, Ningbo, recently had many misunderstandings with the Shanghai National Pharmaceutical Industry Association because they did not understand the principles of cooperation. Therefore, the cooperative's directors Zheng Jiahao and Xu Youheng came to Shanghai to explain the situation to the Pharmaceutical Association. Mu Xizhang, a cooperative affairs specialist from the Zhejiang Construction Department stationed at the Yinjiang Cooperative, and Ye Mei, a cooperative affairs instructor from Yin County, also came to Shanghai to mediate and seek mutual understanding between the two parties.</p>

<h3>Secret Order from the Ministry of Education to Arrest Two University Students for Forging Official Seals and Fake Diplomas</h3>
<p>Rui Dingye of Guanghua University</p>
<p>Chen Changyong of Soochow Law School</p>
<p>Both Arrested by the Local Court</p>
<p>The Nanshi District Court in Shanghai recently received a secret order from the Ministry of Education in Nanjing, stating that two students at Guanghua University, Rui Dingye and Chen Changyong from Chongqing, age twenty, were found to have forged the Ministry of Education's official seal and affixed it to forged diplomas without any validity. The order instructed the court to arrest them. After receiving the telegram, the court immediately ordered bailiffs to go to the school and arrest Rui Dingye, bringing him back to the court for questioning. After checking the school's roster, they discovered that Chen Changyong had transferred to Soochow Law School at 146 Kunshan Road during the summer vacation of this year. The prosecutor, Liu Ying, sent a letter to the police station asking for assistance. The police station dispatched detectives to Soochow Law School and arrested Chen, bringing him to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was brought before Judge Xiao Bianfen of the First Special Court, who specially opened the Third Criminal Court for the trial. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, stated that two bailiffs from the Nanshi District Court came to the police station at approximately 3:30 PM on the 28th, requesting assistance in arresting the two students, Rui and Chen. According to the reason stated in the letter from the district court's prosecutor, they were arrested on suspicion of forging the Ministry of Education's official seal. The police station was requested to detain them. However, the defendant denied forging the official seal at the police station. Chen Changyong also stated that he did not study at Guanghua University, so there may have been a mistake. The court should ask the district court to send a representative to investigate the matter. The district court's bailiff stated in court that they had investigated Chen Changyong's transfer and that Rui Dingye and Chen Changyong were suspected of the same crime, but each case was separate and there was no connection between them. Therefore, it was not necessary to investigate whether the two knew each other. After the district court brought them to trial and investigated them separately, the truth would be revealed. Judge Xiao questioned Chen, who confirmed that his name was Chen Changyong, that he was from Chongqing, that he was twenty years old, that he graduated from Bishan Middle School in Chongqing, that he had a diploma, that he studied at Guanghua University, and that he transferred to Soochow Law School during the summer vacation of this year. He also stated that his middle school diploma was not forged. Judge Xiao asked the police station's lawyer if he had any objections to the district court's request for extradition. The police station's lawyer stated that according to Article 6 of the agreement, a person could be extradited if the person was not mistaken and the situation was accurate. Since the defendant admitted that his name was Chen Changyong and that he had studied at Guanghua University, his name and the facts were consistent. Therefore, the police station did not object to the district court's request for extradition. Judge Xiao then granted the district court's request and handed Chen over to the district court's bailiff to be taken back to the district.</p>
<h3>Two Police Officers Cause an Accident While Playing with Handguns</h3>
<p>Dai Hongkai is Careless</p>
<p>Yang Xihui's Life is in Danger</p>
<p>Yang Xihui, a 26-year-old patrol officer from Sichuan in the Second District of the Nanshi Public Security Bureau, was chatting with household registration patrol officer Dai Hongkai at 12:40 PM yesterday. He saw that Dai's handgun was a new six-inch Browning, which was very clever. Yang liked it so much that he asked Dai Hongkai for permission to exchange his four-inch handgun for it. Unexpectedly, Yang's gun still had bullets in it. When Dai was playing with it, he accidentally touched the trigger, and a bullet flew out, hitting Yang in the abdomen, piercing his back, and causing him to bleed profusely. He collapsed to the ground. He was rushed to Baolong Hospital for treatment by car. The doctor said that his injuries were serious and his life was in danger.</p>
<h3>Siblings Fight Over Inheritance, One Nearly Strangled to Death</h3>
<p>| Fortunately, Early Emergency Treatment Led to Recovery |</p>
<p>Guangfeng Tobacco and Paper Store at 105 Haichao Road and Longfeng Tobacco and Paper Store at 137 on the same road were established by the three Su brothers, Su Longzhi, 45 years old, Su Fengzhi, 42 years old, and Su Aizhi, 37 years old, with their parents' inheritance. Guangfeng Store was managed by Longzhi, while Longfeng Store was managed by Aizhi. Fengzhi opened a sesame cake shop in his hometown. In March 1930, due to unequal distribution of profits, they decided to divide the family assets, dividing 3,000 yuan excluding the land. The sesame cake shop was valued at 200 yuan, so Longzhi paid 800 yuan to make up the 1,000 yuan. However, Longzhi did not pay, so Fengzhi and his wife, Zhou, 22 years old, and their two children came to Shanghai to find their eldest brother to demand the money. The family stayed in the lobby of Guangfeng Store. Longzhi, listening to his wife Wang (31 years old, from Suqian), was unwilling to pay the 800 yuan and told Fengzhi to return to his old business and set up a sesame cake stall in Caoxiewan. Unexpectedly, on September 20th, the wind and rain in Shanghai completely destroyed Fengzhi's flour and sesame cakes, making it impossible for him to continue his business. He returned to Guangfeng Store and demanded 3 yuan in capital from his eldest brother, but they fought. As a result, Fengzhi had a piece of flesh bitten off his right arm, and Longzhi was beaten. Longzhi sued the local court and accused his youngest brother, Aizhi, of joint assault. The hearing was scheduled for yesterday. Unexpectedly, at 3 AM yesterday morning, Zhou, Fengzhi's wife, and Aizhi ran to the police station at Gujiadingkou and reported that Zhou had come to the door, saying that Fengzhi had been strangled to death by his elder brother and sister-in-law. The police rushed to the lobby of Guangfeng Store and found Fengzhi lying on the ground with a straw rope around his neck. They immediately untied the rope and administered emergency treatment. Fengzhi regained consciousness and claimed that Longzhi and Wang had been plotting to kill him for several days. He dared not fall asleep. Tonight, he fell asleep and was strangled by his elder brother and sister-in-law with a straw rope. He almost died from suffocation. They were trying to kill him for his money. Su Longzhi and Su Wang, husband and wife, were arrested and taken to the Third Precinct for interrogation. They firmly denied the murder and claimed that they had set this trap to falsely accuse him. Because the case involved assault, they were both transferred to the local court for trial.</p>
<h3>Record of the Trial of the Xi Shengren Wife-Killing Case</h3>
<p>Xi and His Wife Had Already Signed a Divorce Agreement</p>
<p>Witness Liu Xiaolin Testifies About the Murder</p>
<p>Xi Shengren, a Funing native residing in a bungalow on Kunming Road, stabbed his wife, Gao, twice in the abdomen near the Flag Tobacco Company on Pingliang Road at 6:40 AM the day before yesterday because he resented her for running away with her lover. She fell to the ground and cried for help. Liu Xiaolin, a foreman, heard the alarm and rushed over, captured Xi, and handed him over to the Chinese police, along with the murder weapon. Gao was taken to Shanghai Sanatorium, but died at 7:45 AM due to her injuries. The body was taken to the coroner's office for official examination. Yesterday morning, the police escorted Xi Shengren to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Xiao Bianfen conducted the trial. Zhang Tianyin, the police's lawyer, stated that the defendant's real name was Ji Shengcheng and the deceased's name was Gu. The defendant's claim at the police station that his wife had eloped with someone several months ago was completely inaccurate. Liu Tianqing, the deceased's second husband, testified at the police station that the defendant and his wife had quarreled because they were too poor to support the family. Later, both parties agreed to divorce and signed an agreement. The witness stated that he had published a notice in the newspaper on June 12 stating that both parties agreed to divorce and that neither party would regret it. Their 15-year-old daughter, Xiaomao, would be raised by Ms. Gu. The document was signed by Ji Shengcheng and Gu, and was stamped. The divorce agreement and murder weapon were presented for inspection. The witness, Liu Xiaolin, testified that he was working at the scene when he heard a woman cry for help. He rushed to investigate and saw a woman lying on the ground with a sharp weapon stuck in her abdomen. She was holding the knife with her hand. He turned around and saw the defendant trying to escape. He caught him and handed him over to Chinese policeman No. 1205, who took him to the police station. He did not know the defendant and did not know what he had done. Liu Yuqing, a 34-year-old Funing native living at a noodle shop on Huangpu Pier, Pingliang Road, testified that he married Ji Gu on the 19th day of the fifth lunar month. Wu Jiabao acted as the matchmaker, and he paid 145 yuan. When the agreement was signed, Wu was also present. A fortune teller surnamed Wang wrote the agreement. On June 11 of the solar calendar, her daughter, Xiaomao, was now living at Wu's place. The defendant wanted 200 yuan, but he did not have the money and delayed the wedding. Although they were not yet married, they had already set off firecrackers. The defendant testified that he was forced to sign the divorce agreement by a man surnamed Wang. He had been forced to put his handprint on it, but he had not received any money. Moreover, his wife and Liu Yuqing had already been having an affair. At that time, when he asked his wife to come home, she refused. He took out a knife to scare her, but she snatched it and was accidentally injured. The deceased's mother, Gu Xu, complained that the defendant's divorce from her daughter and her marriage to Liu Yuqing were not her concern. The police's lawyer stated that the deceased had a gold ring, which was temporarily kept at the police station. Because the household had no money for a coffin, he requested that the gold ring be given to them. Judge Xiao approved the request and issued the ring to Liu Yuqing for the coffin. The defendant was taken back into custody, and the trial would continue with more witnesses.</p>
<h3>Travel Agency Organizes a Baibao Tidal Bore Watching Tour</h3>
<p>Travel by Car from Shanghai</p>
<p>Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and the tides in Zhejiang will once again be a spectacle of snow-white waves. Chinese and foreign men and women are flocking to Haining to witness this wonder. However, few know that Baibao, located more than ten miles east of Haining, is the best place to watch the tidal bore. Baibao is located twenty miles east of Haining, where the riverbank juts out. When the tide rushes in, it is struck and obstructed, while another part is not. The two parts meet at Baibao, creating a turbulent spectacle that resembles a stampede of ten thousand horses and tigers chasing sheep. The tide then curves into a low line before heading towards Haining. Therefore, if there is a sudden surge in Haining, it is merely the backlash from Baibao. This year, the China Travel Service, recognizing this, has organized a Baibao Tidal Bore Watching Tour on October 5th, 6th, and 7th, limited to eighty people per day. The tour departs from Shanghai by specially prepared cars. Round-trip car tickets are ten dollars per person. If traveling with a group of four or more, a car can be sent to pick them up at their residence. Detailed rules are available for inspection. Women interested in watching the tidal bore are advised to book seats and purchase tickets as soon as possible to avoid disappointment.</p>

During the meeting, Zhang Shizhen, the director of vehicle affairs, reported on the hospital's recent situation. Dr. Qu then spoke about the hospital's various improvements and stated that the hospital was particularly serious about midwifery, and the fees charged were very low in order to avoid burdening the common people. The attendees then stood up and praised the hospital. A banquet then began, and the guests and hosts enjoyed themselves immensely before dispersing.</p>

<p>Continuous Strange Letters Threatening Huge Sums – He Xing Sock Factory Robbed; Thieves Captured</p>
<p>Two Main Offenders, One Suspect</p>
<p>Stolen Guns Recovered; Interrogation and Investigation Underway</p>
<p>He Xing Sock Factory, located at No. 9 Ku'an Li, Huining Road, Nanshi, employs dozens of male and female workers and is of considerable size. Managed by Chen Yishan, it has been in operation for many years, engaged in both retail and wholesale business and enjoying a thriving business, which has attracted the covetous eyes of bandits. On the 20th and 21st of this month, threatening letters demanding huge sums of money were sent continuously. They requested that on the afternoon of the 22nd, at 9 p.m., banknotes wrapped in newspapers should be thrown into a trash can in Wu Ying Li, Lujiazha, Nanshi, otherwise, there would be no mercy from bullets, and if the authorities were informed, the entire family would be killed. All were purportedly signed by the Shanghai branch of the Communist Youth League. At the time, the factory did not report to the police and ignored the threats. However, yesterday morning at 9:30 a.m., three men wearing short clothes and carrying pistols barged into the factory, went straight upstairs, and were in the midst of ransacking the place when Detective Captain Lu Ying of the Municipal Public Security Bureau happened to order the Second District Detective Squad Leader Li Xiaobao, along with Wang Yingliang, Gu Rusheng, Zhang Kun, Jin Yushan, Sheng Peizhang, Yang…Sen, Wang Gensheng and other detectives and patrol officers Zhou Zhicheng, Yang Xihui, etc., to search pedestrians nearby.

All were taken to the district police station. After interrogation, they were transferred to the Main Bureau for further questioning yesterday afternoon.</p>

<p>Those Seeking Pleasure Should Take Warning</p>
<p>Chen A’ming, a 44-year-old peddler from Ningbo residing at No. 732 Tangshan Road, is of humble character and particularly fond of seeking pleasure. On the evening of the 22nd of this month at 11 p.m., he visited Dong Gu, a fellow townsman, at No. 28 Yuezhou Road to chat. Dong had a 13-year-old daughter, Chengzhen, who was sleeping in the back bedroom of the living room at the time. Later, a friend of Dong's arrived and invited Dong out for drinks. Dong then left. Chen A’ming took this opportunity to sneak into the girl's room and, seeing Chengzhen sound asleep, was overcome with lust. He pulled down the girl's trousers, intending to rape her, but the girl woke up from her sleep and screamed for help. Hearing the cries, the residents rushed in, and Chen fled. Afterwards, Dong Gu returned home, and the girl recounted what had happened. He immediately reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest Chen A’ming. At the same time, Dong Chengzhen was sent to the hospital for examination. Chen was handed over to the First Special District District Court, where he was repeatedly interrogated. The final judgment was scheduled to be announced, as detailed in this newspaper.

<p>Ye Shufang Not Guilty</p>
<p>The woman Ye Wushi, whose husband died early, leaving behind a daughter, had met Ye Shufang, who worked as an accountant at the Yeguang Real Estate Company on Renji Road. In the 13th year of the Republic [1924], they met at the home of Dong Yi…, a friend of Ye Shufang. Dong was the second landlord of Cai Wushi. The two fell in love and soon cohabitated in the Badaitou area of Yangshupu. Ye paid 200 yuan to help Wushi leave her late husband's family. Due to a recent disagreement, Ye Wushi commissioned a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Ye in the First Special District Court, accusing him of seduction and abandonment. After the court hearing, Ye stated that he had been separated from the plaintiff for seven years. He did not know Dong Yi… that person. However, the plaintiff used to rent a house in Yile, and he often went there for entertainment, but there was no physical relationship. As for the request to recover the loan, it was entirely fabricated. After the trial concluded, the verdict was scheduled for one day. The main text of the verdict stated that the defendant was not guilty. The civil part was transferred to the civil court for trial.</p>

The tea attendant led him upstairs, opened room 37, paid the room fee, and then closed the door to sleep. It is unknown why, but he swallowed poison and committed suicide. At 2 a.m., he groaned in pain. Tea attendant Jiang Acheng found out, entered the room to check, and saw Xu's face turned pale, foaming at the mouth, and unable to speak. Knowing that he had taken poison, he immediately informed the accounting room and sent him to Renji Hospital by car. Because he was deeply poisoned, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at 5:30 a.m. yesterday. The hospital notified the French police, who sent detectives to transport the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Funeral Home for autopsy.

The deceased was wearing a white undershirt, a white cotton short shirt, cloud gauze trousers, and black gauze trousers, and light snuff-colored foreign socks, without shoes.

<p>Expanding Sports Venue</p>
<p>To Be Completed This Winter</p>
<p>(Manila News) The Philippine Sports Association, because the 10th Far Eastern Games will be held in Manila in May of next year, has invested 160,000 pesos to rush to build a Rizal Memorial Sports Field near the Harry Road Park in the suburbs of the city so that it can host football, baseball, basketball, swimming, tennis, volleyball and other sports. At present, the equipment for the sports field and diving platform has been completed. The grandstand of the baseball field can accommodate 7,000 people and is constructed of steel and cement. The track and field event will be expanded from seven meters to ten meters, which allows it to run seven times. Every week, it is reduced from 500 meters to 400 meters. In addition, there is another large grandstand that can accommodate 10,000 people, which will be completed in October. The platform is also built of cement, and the straight path is extended to 150 meters.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Guam authorities recently sent a letter to the Philippine Sports Association requesting to join the Far Eastern Games. The Philippine side welcomes it very much, and the Chinese and Japanese authorities have no objection, so it is generally believed that the island may join. Also, Annam has already decided to participate, and Jin Luo has declared that he cannot join. Whether or not Singapore and other countries should join requires the consent of China, Japan, and the Philippines before it can become a reality.</p>

<h3>Deadline for Old Members of the Chinese Football Club to Register Today</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese Football Club began accepting registrations from old members, many have registered, but some have not yet. Please register or notify before 5:00 PM today.

<h3>Questioning the National Games</h3>
<p>Confidential Documents Found in Newspapers</p>
<p>Is Someone Selling News?</p>
<p>The National Games will be held in the capital starting on Double Ten Day. The Director-General of the Games, Zhang Xinfu, and the Director of the Publicity Department, Guo Lianfeng, came to Shanghai once to invite representatives of various newspapers to a banquet, hoping for their sincere cooperation in public opinion to ensure the successful conclusion of the Games. All newspapers were happy to support this for the sake of promoting sports. Therefore, even in the midst of commercial decline, they have not hesitated to sacrifice and allocate space for publicity, jointly planning for the success of the Games. However, the Games should adopt an open attitude towards various news items according to administrative procedures, giving all newspapers equal opportunities and avoiding bias. Otherwise, the hope of cooperation from the newspapers will backfire. However, in recent days, confidential documents from the distribution division, which were not yet ready for publication, have been revealed in the newspapers. Is someone manipulating things from behind the scenes and selling news? This is truly perplexing. It is hoped that the Games authorities will pay close attention to this. The Publicity Department is responsible for publicity and should bear the entire responsibility for determining which news can be published and which news is not yet ready for publication. Otherwise, what is the need for the organization of the Publicity Department, and what is the need for the cooperation of the newspapers? It should be known that investigative activities are the special skill of news reporters. If there is no unified publicity regulation, they can all do their jobs and do their best. However, out of respect for the Games' regulations, they are unwilling to do this. The responsible persons of the Games are questioned as to what they think about this.</p>

<p>Before the opening of last year’s Western League soccer tournament, the Western Police team donated a silver cup, and jointly mandated South China to hold and organise the contest, with a three game two wins rule, deciding who wins or loses. The outcome was that South China won two consecutive games and took the cup. Today the cup will be presented to South China for them to retain. Now a year has easily passed into Autumn. Both sides have restated the prior agreement, settling to play the first game today at 3 pm at the baseball ground. The Western Police has gathered many famous players, hoping to overturn past shame in this game, while South China also gathered and prepared troops, to meet the enemy.

<h3>The Struggle of the Table Tennis Federation</h3>
<p>According to Xu Duojun, an official of the Shanghai Chinese Table Tennis Federation, the Shanghai Chinese Table Tennis Federation held an official meeting at the Zhonghua Jiande Association yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM. Wu Jiangleng, Yu Binqi, and Xu Duo attended, while Lu Xiulu, Hu Jiankun, Liu Keren, Lu Zhongqiu, Liang Zhilin, Liu Guoxiong, Su Renyun, and Zhao Benji attended as observers. Wu Jiangleng chaired the meeting and Liu Keren recorded the minutes. First, Wu Jiangleng reported on the purpose of the meeting. It was learned that the recent newspaper reports about the deformed organization of the pseudo-Shanghai Table Tennis Federation, which requires each team to pay a membership fee of five yuan, similar to a business, is illegal.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Table Tennis Federation is actively pursuing legitimate countermeasures to prevent the outside world from being deceived.</p>
<p>According to Liu Tunfu and Hu Jiankun, they were shocked to see today's newspaper publishing that the Shanghai Table Tennis Federation's First Shanghai Open Group Matches would begin soon and that the registration offices were Hu Jiankun at the Zhonghua Jiande Association on Fusheng Road and Liu Keren at the Fuzhou Road Post Office Jinhui Industry Bureau. They were never consulted or received consent from the undersigned before the federation proceeded with the announcement, which seems to have fraudulently used the names. It is not in accordance with the facts. In addition to submitting a serious protest to the preparatory office of the federation, it is requested that the letter be published to correct the misunderstanding. Thank you very much. This is a joint request from Keren and Hu Jiankun to the editor of the Shen Bao Sports News section.</p>

<h3>A Discussion on the Current State of Overseas Chinese Education in British and Dutch Territories</h3>
<p>Recently, this reporter had an interview with Mr. Huang Kangtun, an educator who recently returned from the Dutch East Indies, specifically Sumatra. Mr. Huang has been teaching in British and Dutch territories in the South Seas for six years and provided insightful comments on the situation in overseas Chinese communities and the realities of overseas Chinese education based on his personal experience. He stated that the overseas Chinese education undertakings in British and Dutch territories vary significantly due to differences in the lenient or strict policies adopted by the local governments (for example, British Burma is the most lenient, the Straits Settlements are stricter, and the Dutch East Indies are the strictest) and the degree of effort exerted by the local overseas Chinese communities. However, they are similar in that they are forced into a state of decline and contraction due to the impact of the local economic climate. Although overseas Chinese in the South Seas have a long history and a large population, the homeland government is unable to help, and the overseas Chinese themselves are not allowed to have strong organizations. The sources of educational funding are limited to monthly donations from businesses, commodity donations based on regulations set by overseas Chinese communities, and special donations raised on an ad hoc basis. With the economic climate being sluggish, these sources of funding are shrinking daily, causing overseas Chinese schools to close or downsize, preventing them from flourishing. Recently, in areas such as the East Coast Province of Sumatra, sugar, rice, and sundry goods merchants have united to negotiate with foreign shipping companies to extract a "ganxian" (a small percentage) of the freight charges as a public fund to be used for charitable undertakings in the overseas Chinese community, which is nothing less than opening a new opportunity for overseas Chinese education. Therefore, there is a promising prospect for development and construction. In Medan, the capital of East Sumatra, schools from primary to secondary levels are co-educational, and the discipline is very good. Moreover, the various administrative functions are unified, with public organizations and personnel planning holistically. The methods of running schools are very economical, which is something that the ports in British territories cannot match.</p>
<p>Next, regarding the issue of teaching materials in overseas Chinese schools, he said that textbooks are the spiritual nourishment of the overseas Chinese community, and they should be appropriate for the time and place. The textbooks used in Chinese schools in British and Dutch territories are mostly old materials from the Commercial Press and the Chung Hwa Book Company. Occasionally, publications from the World Book Company and other publishers are also used, but all must be inspected and approved by the Chinese Affairs Department or the Political Department of the colonial government before they can be adopted. If there are any new ideas or sentences in the text that are not liked by the inspectors, the entire book will be banned. Therefore, most schools have to continue using old textbooks from before 1924, which are not only unsuitable for the local time and place but also for the current time and situation in the homeland. As for political ideas, they are absolutely not allowed to be instilled in schools. For example, a certain middle school in Sumatra used a book on primary school administration in its education department. The authorities, upon seeing the words "administration" and "organization" on the cover, sent the book to the highest authority for inspection, and it has not been returned after two months. Regarding the issue of compiling teaching materials suitable for overseas Chinese schools, most educators in the South Seas are either too busy or unable to do so, and the editors in the homeland have not experienced the situation firsthand and are thus engaging in "closed-door car building" (detached from reality). This is by no means a trivial matter. Furthermore, he mentioned that the Dutch authorities have very thorough procedures for the entry of intellectuals, scrutinizing every detail. Even transferring from British territories requires the same strict procedures. If the information provided is inconsistent, they will be deported shortly after landing. Those who have obtained residence permits and teaching certificates are constantly monitored for their actions and words. Teachers or reporters with fresh ideas who are unwilling to remain silent are often subject to unpredictable misfortunes. At best, they are dismissed from their jobs; at worst, they are immediately imprisoned. This is already a common occurrence. The postal delivery of newspapers and publications is also subject to strict inspection, with the Dutch authorities being even stricter than the British. For example, "Life Weekly" and "The Analects Bi-Monthly" can be sold openly in British territories, but in Dutch territories, they can only be smuggled in as private goods, as they not only avoid revolution but also prohibit humor. We exchanged knowing, silent smiles.</p>

<h3>The Art of Immortality</h3>
<p>— Sun Wenrun</p>
<p>Who doesn't wish they could live forever, never having to experience the sorrow of death? Of course, no national leader or citizen, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, doesn't hope to live as long as heaven and earth, never encountering the tragic pain of national demise.</p>
<p>Qin Shi Huang, since becoming emperor, naturally had the splendid realm under his rule early on. But he also wished the unified land could exist for ten thousand, a hundred million years... under his rule, never changing the Qin Dynasty's name. However, people ultimately grow old and die; to achieve this, one would need to first learn the art of immortality! So he sent Xu Fu aimlessly to the east to seek the elixir of immortality. As a result, Xu Fu never returned, and naturally, he didn't find the elixir; Shi Huang ultimately couldn't avoid aging and dying. The consolidated realm, passed down to the second generation, couldn't avoid loss and decline!</p>
<p>The art of immortality, some say, is a fictional concept, unlikely to become a reality. However, sincerity moves metal, so perhaps it's not entirely like that. I remember once seeing something called the Maitreya Advocacy, which discussed methods for cultivating longevity:</p>
<p>"Covering oneself with rags to ward off the cold, letting go of all worldly matters! If someone drives me, the old fool, I'll still say it's good; if someone beats me, the old fool, I'll fall asleep; tears on the picture, let them dry on their own. I save my strength, and they won't be bothered! Comprehending the principles of the Tao, the sun and moon are my companions."</p>
<p>Back then, Shi Huang was simply too foolish, unable to even put this best method for cultivating longevity into practice; instead, he sent Xu Fu thousands of miles to seek unreliable elixirs, truly ridiculous.</p>
<p>After all, people today are a bit smarter; they still harbor Shi Huang's ambitions, but they are unwilling to emulate his unconscious actions; they're more advanced, so they focus on the Maitreya Doctrine's art of immortality. Even if the neighbor seizes our gatehouse, occupies our connecting stars; we still have many side halls and inner chambers, ultimately not needing to resist. (I save my strength, and they won't be bothered!) When they get tired of living there, it will still return to us; how can it ever lead to decline?</p>
<p>Who still says the "Maitreya Doctrine's" art of immortality is vague and ineffective! Otherwise, why is our China now dedicated to this endeavor?</p>
<h3>Bigu Pill</h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>In recent days, newspapers have been carrying a startling piece of news: a great European doctor has discovered that cotton seeds contain extremely rich nutrients. By extracting the nutrients from cotton seeds and making them into medicinal cake-shaped hunger-relieving products, each person can swallow just two small pieces with boiling water each day, and their stomach won't feel empty for the entire day.</p>
<p>Although this "Bigu Immortal Pill" (a pill allowing one to abstain from grains) hasn't yet been displayed in the shop windows of major stores that "promote global goods," anything is possible in this 20th century. So, everyone needn't worry; in the near future, if the price of gold doesn't soar any higher, then at the very least, the "upper-class Chinese" within the "middle class" will surely throw the bread crusts to their mistress's pet Pekingese for the sake of "saving time," and order "Bigu Immortal Pills" from abroad to replace their three meals of lunch, dinner, and midnight snacks.</p>
<p>If this "Bigu Immortal Pill" one day becomes as common as "black bread" or "big flatbread with fried dough sticks," then I think the changes will be quite remarkable. Perhaps China will once again suffer an unprecedented flood, and when kind-hearted foreign adults and ladies generously donate, they will certainly use "debt pills" instead of "debt wheat."</p>
<p>Taking China as an example, it might also be quite amusing; the economic theory that cheap grain hurts farmers will collapse on its own, because everyone will have become "people who don't eat rice." Vegetables and cucumbers won't need to be planted, and cows, sheep, chickens, and ducks won't need to be raised. So, you plant cotton, and I plant cotton; clothes and food will definitely be plentiful.</p>
<p>Rice shops and flour mills will be on the list of those to be eliminated. Restaurants, porridge shops, dim sum shops, and even wonton vendors and glutinous rice ball stalls will have no customers at all. Fresh meat shops and salted meat shops will certainly have to close their doors, and even the stinky fermented eggs and Japanese fish in the grocery store will cease to exist from then on.</p>
<p>Since everyone has become a "person who drinks water," then the landlords of Shanghai will inevitably smile with joy, and immediately put up red posters for "kitchen rentals," because since the subtenants don't eat rice, there's naturally no need to put the coal stoves and cooking utensils for eating rice in the kitchen. Even those who have prepared these eating utensils might all implement "broken clay pot (quitting)".</p>
<p>After the "Bigu Pill Immortal" becomes popular, when the army "requisitions on the spot," the old common people won't need to "supply military rice" anymore, and when marching, they won't need to "bury the pot and cook rice," which is quite convenient. Even the "rice bowl problem" and "bread problem" that everyone is so worried about now will not be difficult to solve. But I don't know if a "pill problem" will arise in the future; I'm not so sure about that.</p>
<h3>The Water Chestnut Picker</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Like a mirror, the pond's water is so clear that the small fish and shrimp inside are swimming and jumping with liveliness. The villagers can't bear to leave this great water source idle, so they plant water chestnut seedlings inside. Once it reaches July and August, the water chestnuts bloom and bear fruit, with the clear green water surrounding the water chestnut leaves, reflecting many tender red new water chestnuts, which is so beautiful! So bewitching! In the countryside of Jiangnan and eastern Zhejiang, there are so many ponds, so when we go to the countryside, we can see water chestnut ponds everywhere, and we can also pick fresh water chestnuts to eat everywhere. Seeing water chestnut ponds reminds us of water chestnut pickers. When I was young, reading notes and unofficial histories, it always said; "When the setting sun is about to fall, the red clouds reflect on the water chestnut pond, presenting thousands of patterns. At this time, there is a beautiful girl, with her hair like green silk, wearing clothes of light gauze and thin mist, sitting in a lacquered tub, floating in the water chestnut pond. Stretching out her slender jade wrist, picking red water chestnuts, singing a water chestnut song: 'Picking water chestnuts, picking water chestnuts again, there are so many water chestnuts that I can't handle them, people peel the water chestnuts and eat them, who knows how shallow the pond is.'"</p>
<p>"Believing everything in books is worse than having no books." This kind of ghost-like description can only deceive bookworms who never leave their homes. A beauty like Lin Daiyu wouldn't run to the water chestnut pond to pick water chestnuts. Those who pick water chestnuts in the water chestnut pond, even if there are women, are just village girls with disheveled hair; they wouldn't wear light gauze, nor would they sing poetic songs. In the early autumn of the year before last, I went to Jiaxing for a trip. There is the Smoke and Rain Tower famous throughout eastern Zhejiang, the crystal-clear South Lake, and the popular Nanhu dumplings. In such a beautiful place, water chestnut ponds are everywhere, but I couldn't find a water chestnut picker like the one described above. It is conceivable that other places are the same. The water chestnut picker I met was like this, which can also be considered pretty and gentle, and worth writing about.</p>
<p>It was when we were visiting South Lake the year before last that we took a small boat to play by the lake. The water was surrounded by bamboo fences and ropes, which were the water chestnut ponds. The green, hornless Nanhu water chestnuts were growing on the water chestnut stalks, making people's mouths water. My friend Mr. K actually picked a few without permission. At that time, there was a village girl, rowing a small, roofless boat, heading towards us. Judging by her age, she was seventeen or eighteen years old, her hair already cut short; her feet were bare, and her purple thighs were healthily robust. She was wearing a summer cloth shirt and pants, and her face was also tanned purple-black by the sun. Seeing us picking water chestnuts, she told us that this water chestnut pond was her family's, and she also told us to taste the flavor of fresh water chestnut meat. We deliberately didn't leave, and took out forty cents to buy some from her. She picked many for us, and also told us that if we couldn't finish eating them that day, we could dry them in the sun, and they would still be fresh and sweet. Such a water chestnut picker, so innocent and so modest, is already rare to encounter. To be like the one described above, it would be a water chestnut-picking monster. Ha! Ha!</p>
<h3>Star Rain</h3>
<p>— Xinglai</p>
<p>Today's new women are like caged birds, constantly leaping from one form of constraint to another.</p>
<p>A truly modern woman is one who can fight against adverse environments, forge her own path, and stand independently.</p>
<p>The most beautiful flowers are often fruitless, and the most alluring women often lack a future.</p>
<p>A woman's beauty isn't her crime, yet people often make it the source of wickedness.</p>
<p>Some call female office workers "vases," but I think many male office workers could also be called "lacquered rice buckets."</p>
<p>The one who praises women the most is also the one who scolds them the most.</p>
<h3>The Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Bitter Feelings in the Heart, Offering Blessings, Hurried Military Affairs, Secret Transfer of Troops</p>
<p>He thought to himself, this is really fast. First, he didn't eat anything, but in a moment, he finished a plate of custard. Ji Zhi noticed that the shop assistant was paying attention to him, and he felt a little embarrassed. He hurriedly finished his coffee, paid the bill, and got up to leave. Zhang San, the rickshaw puller, had left his rickshaw here, but he was nowhere to be seen. Ji Zhi thought he was a poor laborer, and he had to wait for him to come back to give him the fare. So he stood at the gate, waiting for him to return. Unexpectedly, he waited for a long time, but he still didn't come back. He thought to himself that standing on the street might make people suspicious, and he didn't know what was going on. It would be better to walk around Haidian Street a couple of times to see what the recent situation on Haidian Street was like, and then come back later. He probably wouldn't be too late. So he walked off wherever his feet led him. It was strange, his legs didn't even need his command, they were already walking towards the gate of Old Miss Yang's house. Originally, he thought he would just walk to that street and take a look. But after arriving on that street, he thought again that since he was already here, it would be good to go to the gate of the Yang's house and take a look. Fortunately, there was no one at the gate, so it wouldn't matter if he walked past. And so, he walked to the Yang's house, which he had been ashamed to pass for half a year. His initial intention might have been to see if it was just an empty gate, like peach blossoms and a beautiful face. But just as he walked to the gate, a large group of people poured out, both men and women. Among them, some were wearing yellow military uniforms, and some were wearing long pink dresses, which made him particularly sad. This was because one was Zhao Ziqiang, and the other was Yang Guizhi. Ji Zhi was stunned when he suddenly saw them. Because besides the pink silk jacket she was wearing, Guizhi's hair was also styled in a "piled cloud" style today. A red silk ribbon was pressed around her hair. Needless to say, her face was covered with makeup, just the right amount. A red velvet flower was inserted diagonally below her sideburns on her left ear. She clearly looked like a bride. (201)</p>

Later, because Reuters reported that American Feng Bank had received a telegram from Washington stating that although no one can currently determine whether stabilizing the U.S. dollar is an urgent task, it is very obvious that the management committee has no opinion on the issues of starting inflation. In addition, when President Roosevelt returned to his hometown to rest, he did not express any opinion on expanding credit to help agriculture and industry. People's hearts were better, and the midday market seemed lively. The afternoon market trended downward, and people's hearts also appeared tired, struggling around $80.

<h3>First Batch of American Cotton Arrives in Shanghai</h3>
<p>丨Totaling Eleven Thousand Three Hundred and Fifty Bales丨</p>
<p>Minister of Finance of the National Government, Mr. Song Ziwen, previously in the United States, established a loan of 50 million US dollars for cotton and wheat. Among them, the total cotton amounts to a massive 4.2 million bales. The first batch of American cotton being transported to China was loaded by the Fulae Foreign Firm onto the "Aishan Lun" (a transliteration of the ship's name). This batch totals eleven thousand three hundred and fifty bales. It arrived in Shanghai from Wusong at approximately 10 a.m. yesterday. The ship is currently docked at the China Merchants Bureau wharf and will immediately begin unloading and storing the cotton in warehouses. It is said that a portion of it has already been purchased by a certain party.</p>
<p>American Cotton Shows No Progress</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market situation was mixed and uncertain, awaiting government reports. It initially fell due to enthusiastic collection of funds, then rebounded due to good demand for spot goods. As a result, spot goods fell 10 points, and futures fell 6 to 10 points. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot goods fall by 3 points and futures fall by 3 to 4 points. Egyptian cotton spot goods rose by 1 point. The Bombay cotton market was closed. The original telegraph record is as follows (dated the 28th):</p>

<p>Rice Prices: Yuan Variety Alone Rises by Two to Three Cents</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply remained strong, with over forty boats arriving at various merchant wharves. The market initially experienced a sharp decline in the morning, but slightly recovered in the afternoon. Local shops showed some strength, and merchants from other regions also made purchases, resulting in a relatively good situation. However, due to prolonged weakness, prices were difficult to raise significantly, so the overall situation remained stable but tight. Common varieties such as Su, Tong, and South Port broken rice, as well as old and new "ke jian" rice, only fluctuated by a few cents. However, "qing jiao" and "song si" foreign rice varieties saw stronger demand due to the scarcity of "qing si" goods in the market. Merchants purchased over a bag each, mostly Songjiang foreign rice, except for new "yang jian" rice, as Songjiang foreign rice was slightly more popular. However, price increases varied. New fragrant rice also stabilized, while "bian yuan" rice was scarce and particularly popular, rising by two to three cents. The new price from the factories in Guangdong was seven yuan.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-seven to twenty-eight boats arrived from various river routes. The price of broken rice fell by half a cent in the morning, but stabilized slightly in the evening. The price of new rice fell slightly by one cent. New and old "yang du jian," "bo geng," "tuan jian," "dong xi geng," and "ke jian" rice varieties remained the same as yesterday. White yuan rice was scarce, and the price increased by one cent. New "bu jian" rice showed a slightly tighter trend.</p>
<p>High Sales for Arriving "Ke Hsien" Rice</p>
<p>Yesterday, the "ke hsien" rice market continued to experience strong sales for both arriving and outgoing goods. Arrivals included Hunan rice transported by Nanjing trains and Yangtze River boats. Outgoing destinations were primarily Fujian, followed by Shantou. Local shops and Ningbo also engaged in some business. Arrivals have been extremely strong in recent days, and inventory is gradually increasing. Although outgoing sales are active, they are not as high as arrivals, so the market has become flatter. The upward trend of the past few days has shifted to a weaker outlook. However, cargo owners remain very firm, mostly limiting sales to break-even prices and unwilling to sell cheaply. Demand from Fujian and Guangdong is expected to continue, so it is difficult for customers to force prices down. Yesterday, high-grade rice and brown rice were slightly firmer, welcomed by some "ke" merchants, and difficult to lower in price. Only sentiment was slightly downward. A total of 1,500 bags of Hunan machine-milled rice were sold at prices ranging from seven yuan and five and a half cents to seven yuan and two and a half cents. An additional 750 bags of "po" rice were sold at a price of six yuan and six cents. An additional 1,700 bags of brown rice were sold at a price of five yuan and nine cents. 300 bags of Nanjing factory "hsien" rice were sold at a price of seven yuan and one cent. An additional 141 bags of brown rice were sold at a price of six yuan, two cents and three cents. 200 bags of Jiaxing "yang jian" rice were sold at a price of seven yuan and four cents, with lower grades discounted accordingly.</p>
<p>Near-Term Flour Plummets by Three Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw a sharp decline in near-term months after the opening bell in both the morning and afternoon, while distant months remained stable. Prices for foreign wheat continued to decline, with Chicago down slightly by one to four cents, and Canada down by four to five cents. Therefore, most months were generally weak after the opening bell, with little activity. Due to the delivery of the current month, many long positions were unwound, further depressing prices. At the afternoon opening bell, because only half a day of trading remained for the current month, many off-market long positions had to be closed out. With a significant amount of inventory, all positions were gradually liquidated, causing the market to plummet. At the closing bell, the price reached a new low of two yuan, one cent, five mills and seven and a half cash. This new record was unprecedented. However, hedging by off-market parties in distant months helped to support the market, although the hedging situation worsened. As a result, the current month plummeted by three cents, October was down by two and a half mills, November was up by five mills, December was up by two and a half mills, and the remaining months remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Difficult Trading: Wheat Futures Stagnant</p>
<p>丨Spot Wheat Trading Still Active丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was extremely quiet after the opening bell in both the morning and afternoon. Although foreign wheat prices continued to decline slightly by two to four or five cents, industry insiders believed that while it was possible for foreign wheat prices to approach domestic prices, the difficulty in selling flour made both buying and selling difficult. As a result, the market stagnated. Consequently, November rose by one cent, December fell by one cent, and the remaining months remained unchanged. The spot wheat market saw active trading. Due to customer demand, the price of high-quality wheat seemed to increase by two to three cents. "Kai Yao Wan" wheat was priced at three yuan, nine cents and seven mills, down to nine cents. "Wuhe" wheat was priced at three yuan, nine cents and three cents. "Taizhou" wheat was priced at three yuan, eight cents and four cents. "Gaoyou" wheat was priced at three yuan, seven cents and seven mills, down to seven cents and three mills. "Lu Jin" wheat was priced at three yuan, seven cents and six mills. "Yangzhou" wheat was priced at three yuan and six and a half cents. A total of 9,200 bags were traded.</p>
<p>Soybean Sales Active, Inventory Still Flat</p>
<p>The soybean market has seen little activity in recent times due to limited supply and weak demand, so there has been no major fluctuation. Slightly more transactions took place yesterday, but none involved large purchases. Factories purchased six carloads of Dalian beans at a price of four yuan, one cent and seven mills, and one cent and six mills. "Chefang" purchased 500 bags of Andong beans at a price of four yuan, two cents and two mills. 500 bags of Zhengyangguan beans were priced at four yuan, five cents and a half, purchased by the Fuwen merchants. 1,100 bags of Jiangbei new beans were traded at prices ranging from four yuan and four cents to four yuan and one cent, also purchased by the Wenfu merchants. 800 bags of Hankou early beans were priced from four yuan and zero cents and three mills to three yuan and eight cents and three mills, purchased by local shops and the Xiamen, Wenzhou merchants.</p>
<p>Prices of Silk, Tea, Needle Eyebrows, and Gongxi All Trending Downward</p>
<p>Yesterday, sales of foreign firm tea remained slow. Inventories of "zhen mei" teas from Tunxi, Shexian, and Suian were depleted. Although European firms sent telegrams for "gong se" teas from Wuyuan north road, there were very few responses. However, English firms such as "Xie He" and "Tong Fu" and "Baitou" merchants made purchases of green teas such as "zhen mei" and "gong xi." Total sales of green tea from various regions in the city amounted to 1,690 boxes, with prices for "zhen mei" and "gong xi" falling by four to five yuan to as much as ten yuan, according to market reports.</p>
<p>Sugar Market: "Long Gang Qing" Opens at Over 500 Bags</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend remained stable. The public association's listed price for fourth-grade raw sand white common goods remained at 21 yuan and 8 cents. The new cargo of Dutch red sugar was bid at 16 yuan and 8 cents, but no deal was made. Taikoo Sugar B was priced at 21 yuan and 7 cents, CW brand was priced at 21 yuan and 5 cents and a half. China Guohua Zhenji No. 1 cotton white sugar was priced at 20 yuan and 7 cents, with the remainder following the same pattern. Over 500 bags of Long Gang Qing sugar were opened at prices ranging from 15 yuan to 14 yuan and 8 cents and a half.</p>
<p>North-South Goods: New Tong'an Longan Sees Varying Price Fluctuations</p>
<p>New Tong'an longan has arrived in greater quantities this time, and the number of medium and lower grades from Xinghua is even larger. Therefore, at yesterday's opening, medium-grade merchants wanted to lower prices by six to seven yuan but did not make a deal. However, top-grade large longan, which were few in number, opened at prices two to three yuan higher than before.</p>
<p>Piece Goods: Domestically Produced Woolen Fabrics Sell Well in Time</p>
<p>Domestically produced woolen fabrics have been making progress in recent times, with a surge in sales of domestically produced yarn and woolen textiles. This year is the "Year of National Products," and business is booming. Zhanghua riding breeches, French flannel, plain serge, tweed, Haijing's yellow camel hair, suit tweed, autumn overcoat tweed, Daohua's genuine horse mane sleeve lining, and silk-like diagonal feather yarn are in continuous demand from Japanese customers, with both retail and wholesale transactions increasing. Daohua silk-like feather yarn sells for 85 cents per yard, genuine horse mane sleeve lining for 1 yuan and 35 cents, Haijing men's and women's colored autumn wear woolen fabric for 8 yuan and 5 cents, suit tweed ranging from over 6 yuan to the top grade double-sided yellow camel hair for 12 yuan and 5 cents, second grade for 8 yuan and 8 cents, Zhanghua 918 serge for 3 yuan and 2 cents, military uniform yellow woolen fabric for 3 yuan and 1 cent and a half, and striped French flannel for 4 yuan and 5 cents.</p>
<p>Hardware: British Tinplate Scarce and Soaring</p>
<p>Since the appreciation of the US dollar exchange rate, transactions in American goods have flourished. As a result, orders for American tinplate have also sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Conversely, the tightening of British oil has reduced orders for British tinplate. Recently, there have been almost no British goods arriving in China, and the goods circulating in the market have become scarce and soaring in price. Currently, 90-pound tinplate is estimated at 16 yuan and 2 cents, up 3 cents from before. Double-length is 31 yuan and 5 cents, also up half a yuan. 100-pound tinplate is 17 yuan, up 2 cents. Double-length is 35 yuan, up 1 yuan. Qingdao, Yantai, and Fuzhou merchants are all interested in trading, but the market supply is insufficient to meet demand. Business in American goods is very prosperous, and prices are still moderate due to the daily appreciation of the US dollar exchange rate. Currently, 90-pound tinplate sells for 17 yuan, 100-pound tinplate for 18 yuan, and 100-pound double-length for 38 yuan and 5 cents. It is said that over a thousand boxes were sold yesterday.</p>

<p>Special Fashion Issue No. 4</p>
<h3>Clothing and Demeanor by Yang An</h3>
<p>Clothing is a tool for self-expression. Generally, when observing a person's attitude and appearance, the first thing one notices is their clothing. I will not delve into theory; let me first present some facts to prove my point:</p>
<p>A certain bank held an oral examination for prospective employees. Out of 125 applicants, 30 passed. These 30 individuals all received a grade of A for their demeanor, and the primary reason for this grade was their attire. Later, I asked the oral examiners, and they said that they felt that over two-thirds of these 30 individuals were wearing simple and elegant clothing, with a majority wearing cloth garments.</p>
<p>A certain company held an examination for shop clerks. Out of 200 applicants, 120 failed, primarily due to poor demeanor. Of these 120 individuals with poor demeanor, 20% had poor walking posture, 15% had poor speaking skills, 10% had poor facial appearance, and 45% had poor clothing.</p>
<p>A certain school held an entrance examination. Out of 1,200 applicants, 200 were admitted. Among these 200 new students, only 10% wore Western suits, approximately 35% wore silk garments, and 50% wore cloth garments.</p>
<p>5. Because silk garments are light and beautiful, while cloth garments are simple, elegant, generous, and possess an attitude of frugal beauty and robust beauty. Butterfly Lady wears national fabric cloth apparel from Butterfly fabric.</p>
<p>From the perspective of ordinary people, clothing should be exquisite and of high value. In reality, the true value of clothing lies in (1) quiet and simple colors, (2) colorfastness, and (3) durability. I believe that domestically produced clothing materials meet these criteria in various ways. For tailoring Western suits, there are Zhanghua woolen fabrics. For tailoring light and beautiful clothing, there are Meiya silk fabrics. For tailoring simple, elegant, durable, and beautiful clothing, there are various piece goods from the Hongxin Cloth Factory. We young people, especially those of us living in this era of national crisis, should cultivate the virtue of wearing cloth garments. Hongxin cloth pieces perfectly embody the three principles of colorfastness, simplicity, and economy. We do not believe that only Butterfly Lady looks beautiful wearing Hongxin cloth garments. To be honest, my wife and daughters have long been accustomed to wearing cloth garments and are long-time customers of Hongxin. Once, while publicly advising ladies and young women to wear simple, elegant, and economical clothing with Mrs. Huang Renzhi, we surprisingly received applause from the female guests. Now that Butterfly Lady has endorsed this idea and is promoting cloth garments in the film industry, I believe everyone will undoubtedly agree. Then, the cloth garment movement by female students with the goal of simplicity, elegance, and economy is self-evident.</p>
<h3>New Clothing Suited to the Face Beneath the Pearl Tower by Han Liang</h3>
<p>This describes the demeanor of ancient women. The most interesting part is the addition of the words "suited to the face" after "new clothing." What is the relationship between new clothing and the face? Can new clothing transform ugliness into beauty? Indeed! Many women, whose faces are not particularly beautiful, appear much more attractive when wearing beautifying new clothing. We see women who are disheveled and sleepy are like uncut jade. At this time, if many similar women gather together,</p>
<p>it will still be possible to distinguish who is better and who is worse. After combing and applying makeup, they radiate vitality and are refreshingly new. But this is only half an image; only when they put on new clothing and gracefully descend the pearl tower do they become a complete painting. Therefore, these two words, "suited to the face," are not very experienced and artistic.</p>
<p>What kind of new clothing can be suited to the face? First, it must be (fitted); second, it must be (appropriate). What does "fitted" mean? For example, tall individuals should use two or more colors and coordinate them in sections, at least layering a short jacket over a long garment. Following the curves of the body is a necessary condition, but it is not suitable for those who are overweight. Therefore, size and length should vary according to the individual. What does "appropriate" mean? For example, dark colors are currently popular, but regardless of age or season, using dark colors not only fails to enhance beauty but also diminishes it. Generally, colors and patterns are most closely related to the face because light and color tones are connected to the contour and reflection of the face.</p>
<p>Nowadays, women also like to avoid applying heavy makeup, only applying a touch of rouge to the cheeks. This is the ancient "drunken makeup," often referred to as "mao yin" in poetry, which refers to drunken makeup. What kind of new clothing should be used for drunken makeup? This is a very interesting question. Please let friends who study new clothing discuss it! I would also like to offer some opinions: the colors should be light and elegant, the patterns should be ancient and simple, and the material can be silk or cloth. Is this correct?</p>
<h3>Color Matching Methods for Modern Women's Clothing by Yi Xiang (Continued)</h3>
<p>Blue as the Main Color</p>
<p>Among colors, blue is deep, elegant, and refined. It is also graceful and pleasing to the eye, able to evoke joy and dispel boredom. Therefore, Western women also like to have it. However, color matching should be clean and bright. The complementary colors of blue are listed below:</p>
<p>(Complementary Colors) Black, beige, white</p>
<p>Azure is a Type of Blue; Namely, Evergreen</p>
<p>Azure is a type of blue, slightly lighter in color, possessing some artistic quality. Its secondary colors are not the same as those of blue and are excerpted below:</p>
<p>(Complementary Colors) Red, light blue, white</p>
<p>Light Blue is a Type of Blue</p>
<p>Light blue is also a beautiful color among blues, clear and without vulgarity, beautiful and delicate, making it an outstanding color in blue. It is best paired with clean colors.</p>
<p>(Complementary Colors) Silver, dark blue, white</p>
<p>Blue-Violet is a Type of Blue</p>
<p>The most clear and beautiful color in the blue category is blue-violet. Its color is elegant and fluid, possessing a delicate charm and a clear and beautiful quality, free from vulgarity. It is truly the best among blues. Its compatible colors are listed below:</p>
<p>(Complementary Colors) Dark blue-violet, peach red, sky blue</p>
<p>Clothing is Like Wrapping Paper for Goods by Zhuo Dai</p>
<p>Clothing on the outside of the human body is like the advertising paper wrapped around a commodity. On the one hand, it protects and adorns what's inside, and on the other hand, it can also indicate what kind of commodity it is, and whose product it is. Therefore, the paper that wraps sugar-roasted chestnuts must never be used to wrap mooncakes; this is a certainty. Because if the paper used to wrap sugar-roasted chestnuts were used to wrap mooncakes, people would definitely not think there are mooncakes inside, but would always assume that there are sugar-roasted chestnuts.</p>
<p>The same is true for clothing on the outside of the human body. If the body is a domestic product (i.e., the parents and ancestors are all Chinese), then it is best if the clothing on the outside is also made of domestic products. It can indicate what kind of commodity it is? And whose product is it? In case a Chinese person wears foreign clothes, we will definitely have doubts about their nationality and about their parents and ancestors.</p>
<p>So there is no other meaning for Chinese people wearing Chinese clothes, except to show that they are Chinese.</p>
<p>Symbol of Civilization by Er Xian</p>
<p>Mr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of the People's Livelihood reveals four elements: clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Why did he put "clothing" in the first place?</p>
<p>This reason is not difficult to understand. Let us think about what is the characteristic of us human beings? Needless to say, it is civilization. What is the most indicative of civilization? We can not but say it is clothing. Because food, housing, and transportation are not needs unique to human beings, and some birds and animals even eat better and live more comfortably than the average poor person. We only need to go to the zoo to see this situation clearly. As for the problem of "transportation", are the trails created by animals in the deep mountains and forests any worse than the wild paths walked by the villagers? Only "clothing" is something that no animal needs except civilized humans. This is a symbol of human civilization.</p>
<p>Once we recognize this point, we can get a grasp of civilization from human clothing.</p>
<p>First, let's start from the vertical aspect. In primitive times, what humans used to cover their bodies was either leaves or grasses. By the hunting and gathering era, humans knew to skin animal hides to keep warm. It was not until agriculture developed that a kind of coarse cloth woven from cotton and hemp appeared, which was wrapped around the waist. This coarse cloth evolved into clothing for men and women. Later, as social organization became more complex, clothing also adapted to human psychology, adding various patterns, such as ceremonial dresses, uniforms, and so on. Today, material civilization has many-faceted and complex developments, and in the streets of big cities we can see all kinds of bizarre and colorful clothes, some gorgeous, some simple, some solemn, and some full of temptation. In short, these are all reflections of modern civilization. We can say that the evolution of clothing from leaves to new clothes in 1933 is also the evolution of civilization. Let's talk about it from a horizontal perspective. People's clothes often differ to some extent due to their region, class or occupation, and we can see all kinds of civilized factors in this. Urban fashion is extravagant, while rural clothes are simple. These are the characteristics of urban civilization and rural civilization. The brown and black shirts of modern Germany and Italy represent the civilization of European fascists. The red scarves of the Soviet Young Pioneers represent communist civilization. Philosophers divide world civilization into two major fields, Eastern and Western, which is especially evident in clothing. Eastern clothing has long lapels and large sleeves. One garment can be worn by many people with similar body types without seeming very inappropriate. This shows the general and chaotic spirit in Eastern Zhanghua No. 5 horse riding breeches weaving civilization. Western clothing is tailored to each person's body contours, striving for a perfect fit, which shows the individualism and scientific spirit in Western civilization.</p>
<p>What has been said above is about the form of clothing. Now let's talk about the material of clothing.</p>
<p>Clothing fabrics can be divided into two main categories: plant fibers such as cotton and hemp, and animal fibers such as silk and wool. In terms of quality, animal fiber fabrics are generally superior. In the history of civilization, animal fiber fabrics were also more advanced inventions, with artificial silk being a natural exception. Among animal fiber types, silk fabrics are a product of Eastern civilization, and woolen fabrics are a product of Western civilization. Silk fabrics are softer and more suitable for women's wear, while wool fabrics are more suitable for tougher men's wear. Both have their own strengths. Therefore, in the early years of international trade, Eastern silks were exported to Western countries in large quantities and were popular with Western ladies, while Western serge and flannel were also imported to the East in large quantities and were welcomed by our compatriots, especially men.</p>
<p>Later, the Western countries themselves also planted mulberry trees, raised silkworms, and wove silk fabrics, so they no longer needed to buy our silk fabrics. However, because our compatriots have recognized the durability and warmth of woolen fabrics, they still cannot help but buy Western serge and flannel. Therefore, our country has an uncompensable deficit of tens of millions of yuan in this area every year.</p>
<p>However, now a new turning point has arrived. In recent years, my country's woolen weaving industry has made rapid progress. The representative of the industry, Zhanghua Woolen Mill, spins and weaves its own serge, cheviot, overcoat, flannel, camel hair, etc. Its quality is comparable to that of the best European and American manufacturers, and its price is much lower than that of imported products, which has been warmly welcomed by the Chinese people.</p>
<h3>My Family's Autumn Clothing Expenses by Bingying</h3>
<p>We are a small family: a husband, a wife, one son who is only six years old, and a daughter who is also only nine years old. My husband's monthly income is 160 yuan. After all daily expenses, we save about 24 yuan each month. (All four of us have a savings account, and each account saves 6 yuan each month).</p>
<p>Our estimated daily expenses for clothing are about 20 yuan each month. Naturally, autumn and winter clothes are more expensive, so we save a bit more during the spring and summer to make up for it.</p>
<p>We have added quite a few new clothes for autumn this year. The whole family has new clothes. Because we don't need to buy any lined clothes, all the clothes we bought are single-layered.</p>
<p>At first, I wanted to buy two outfits for both of my daughters, but my husband advised me to have my old silk dress re-tailored for one of them, and instead bought me a new trendy crepe. Since he didn't buy himself anything, I bought him some natural crepe to make him a long robe. I bought Butterfly cloth and Angora for my daughters to make two Western-style outfits. I initially planned to buy fabric to tailor something for my son, but coincidentally saw a department store selling ready-made 918 serge suits that fit him perfectly, so I bought one for him. We needed to add undershirts, so I bought two ready-made ones as well. Although I have a crepe dress, I can only wear it outside. It's too much of a waste to wear it for chores at home, so I bought some Datong cloth to make another dress for daily wear. Even though I'm very experienced in tailoring and never hire a tailor, saving a lot of tailoring fees, buying all this fabric still cost 33 yuan and 58 cents. Our household expenses are all based on a budget, so we can't exceed it. I might as well make our autumn clothing expenses public. If there is an economist who can advise us on how we can save even more, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<h3>Cigarettes, Coffee, and the Night</h3>
<p>— Di Bi</p>
<p>To be a writer, the first thing to learn is to smoke. Because if you are a writer, you will inevitably have to write. But writing is said to require inspiration. So, what do you do when inspiration doesn't come? If you know how to smoke, then there's a solution: smoking. After the cigarette is lit, you can stare blankly at the wisps of smoke, curling upwards, and then inspiration will come. As soon as inspiration arrives, you quickly unfold your manuscript paper and then write, write, write continuously. One hour passes, two hours pass, three hours pass, and your masterpiece is completed.</p>
<p>If, even after three hours, your masterpiece is still not finished, then you can drink coffee. You know that brewing your own coffee is a relatively troublesome and time-consuming task, and you also know that you don't have servants or maids waiting to be at your beck and call. So, you have to come up with a simple way to drink coffee. This simple way might be to brew the coffee beforehand and leave it to cool, or, if you want it hot, place the pre-brewed coffee in hot water. Or, you might even find the pre-brewing process too troublesome and spend seven or eight copper coins to buy a piece of (coffee tea), which you can drink simply by adding some boiling water, without even needing to add sugar. Once you drink the coffee, you become excited and then write, write, write. And writing must be done at night, and it must be after twelve o'clock, because your spirit won't be aroused until then. When you get tired of writing, you smoke and drink coffee; when you get tired again, you smoke again and drink again. So four o'clock passes, five o'clock passes, six o'clock passes. When you can no longer suppress your blurred vision, dizziness, and yawns with cigarettes and coffee, you put down your fountain pen, jump into bed, and burrow into your wife's blankets.</p>
<p>The second night arrives, and after twelve o'clock, you become excited as usual, and write as usual. You spend many spring nights, summer nights, autumn nights, and winter nights like this. (Ah, the writer's night is so strange and mysterious!) You can't help but exclaim.</p>
<p>Oh, the writer's night!</p>
<h3>On Rebuilding the Confucian Temple</h3>
<p>— Da Yi</p>
<p>At the end of last month, the newspaper reported that a certain general in a certain province performed a ritual to Confucius with ancient music at the mao hour on the 27th. How grand! Even a resolute military man can respect Confucius so much. I, a humble scholar, am extremely ashamed and fearful! I am reminded of the Confucian Temple in Qufu, which suffered greatly from the ravages of war. The proposal to rebuild it was initiated by important figures. However, due to the Japanese invasion, there was no time for cultural affairs. Is heaven about to abandon civilization? The Five Teachings are not practiced, and the hundreds of rituals are completely destroyed. The old temple is ruined and not rebuilt. The sound of lectures has ceased and is not continued. This is truly a responsibility that we scholars who revere and worship Confucius cannot escape!</p>
<p>Since Wei Wen emphasized Confucianism and honored Confucius, he ordered the Lu Commandery to rebuild the old temple. Throughout the dynasties, there were repairs and renovations. When commanderies and counties established schools, temples were built all over the country. As for the Li Tang dynasty, they revered Laozi, and Daoism was prevalent at that time. Daoism, Buddhism, and Confucianism divided the teachings into three, and Confucius's authority was somewhat diminished. Although there were Han Yu and Li Ao who vigorously opposed Buddhism and Daoism, the declining trend of Confucianism was not reversed, and the temple sacrifices to Confucius were gradually replaced. By the Five Dynasties period, the dilapidation of Confucian temples in various places was even more unbearable. There is a poem that can be used as evidence to illustrate this point. Luo Yin's poem "Visiting the Temple of the King of Culture" says:</p>
<p>In the late evening, I ride my enthusiasm to visit the former teacher,</p>
<p>The pines and cypresses are desolate, and no one knows.</p>
<p>The nine-foot wall is piled with tiles and rubble,</p>
<p>The three-room thatched hall is haunted by foxes.</p>
<p>The rain sounds like the mournful cries of a unicorn,</p>
<p>The dew falls like sighs for the phoenix's grief.</p>
<p>If even a small scholar's name is slightly established,</p>
<p>How could I let my Way suffer such neglect!</p>
<p>This poem describes the desolate and deserted state of the Confucian Temple, enough to make Confucians sigh and heretics laugh. There is also a reply to the King of Culture:</p>
<p>Among the three teachings, Confucianism is the most revered,</p>
<p>Stopping war is making martial, and martial reveres culture.</p>
<p>I am still wearing a straw raincoat and hat,</p>
<p>Why do you need to ask for scriptures and ancient texts?</p>
<p>Buddhist pagodas invade the blue sky,</p>
<p>Daoist palaces brush against the green clouds.</p>
<p>If Yan Hui and Min Ziqian's spirits were here,</p>
<p>They would not be ashamed of Laozi.</p>
<p>Such humorous poems are suitable for inclusion in a collection of humorous literature. The fact that the Confucian Temple was not as prosperous as Buddhist temples and Daoist temples at that time is indeed supported by this poem.</p>
<p>Also, when Feng Dao governed Nanyang, the local Temple of the Sage was dilapidated. More than a dozen wine merchants submitted a petition requesting repairs. Before Dao could make a judgment, a staff member wrote after the petition:</p>
<p>The shade of locust trees covers the apricot altar,</p>
<p>Confucian disciples are all high officials.</p>
<p>Yet you teach the wine merchants to rebuild the temple,</p>
<p>It is not difficult to find my shame and fear.</p>
<p>Dao immediately dismissed the wine merchants' request and used his own salary to rebuild the temple. The staff member's action was quite humorous, and Feng Dao can also be said to have known what was appropriate. The Old Man of Chang Le claimed to have the same lifespan as Confucius. If Confucius had a spirit, he would probably smile and allow it.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there was Li Xianggu, who once served as the defender of Chenzhou. When he visited the Temple of the Master, he saw the statue in a dilapidated house and sighed for a long time. The actor Li Huakai stepped forward and offered a jingle:</p>
<p>Three dilapidated rooms,</p>
<p>A desolate traveler.</p>
<p>I don't know what burden he carries,</p>
<p>Doomed to live and die in Chen.</p>
<p>Xianggu immediately used his salary to repair it. Considering Confucius's life and deeds, if he had a feud with actors and female musicians, who would have known that more than a thousand years later, his Chenzhou temple would be revived and continued, thanks to the eloquence of an actor?</p>
<p>Now that the Yellow River has cleared and the sea waves are calm (having abandoned their ancestors' ways and cultivated what was not lost), we have already seen poets sing praises. May the Confucian Temple in Qufu regain its magnificence, and may the schools throughout the country also be renovated! May Yan Hui and Min Ziqian, if they have spirits, jointly play the silk and bamboo instruments in the wall; may Cheng Yi and Zhu Xi reappear and stir up the waves of the Si River again. A humble Confucian scholar by the sea cannot help but eagerly pray.</p>
<h3>On Modern Chinese Women</h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Although I am one of the young men, I am quite concerned about women's issues. This concern is not like those pretty boys' cultural representatives, who have another purpose. Rather, it is because, from the perspective of the overall social problem, the issue of modern Chinese women is indeed a problem worth studying.</p>
<p>Anyone who is slightly aware of the international situation probably knows that there are many women active on the political stage of various countries in the world. Some of them are members of parliament, some are ambassadors, and some even enter the cabinet. And in Soviet Russia, women participate in production almost as much as men. These all prove that women's abilities are not lower than men's, and may even exceed them.</p>
<p>However, looking back at the women in China today, what is the situation? Unfortunately! Excuse me for saying something disrespectful, but there are very few who are eye-catching, even if they can draw their eyebrows thin and long, paint their faces white with a rosy glow, wear colorful clothes, and raise the heels of their shoes by three inches.</p>
<p>Recalling the female students in front of the Zhifu government on March 18th who, after being shot, covered their wounds with scarves without showing any panic, which even astonished the president of the Japanese Beijing Weekly, Fujiwara, as (representing the new opportunity for China's revival). (See Mr. Qi Ming's "Women of New China" in Yusi Issue 73) And the earth-shattering momentum of the women in the political department when the revolutionary army swore an oath to the Northern Expedition in Shaoguan. Looking at the current so-called modern women, who are commodities waiting to be sold at home, vases in society, and appendages of their husbands after marriage. It is truly like a feeling of being in another world.</p>
<p>Even women's groups and publications about women are not as prosperous as before. Taking Shanghai as an example, before the national crisis, there was a women's association that was equal to nothing. After the national crisis, it was changed to a women's relief association. But the women's relief association itself seemed to be waiting for relief and soon disappeared without a trace. As for publications, (Women's Magazine was destroyed by bombing, and New Women died a natural death because the old publisher declared that women's issues would be changed to practical matters). Now, although there are still a few surviving, they are not very meaningful. The era has eliminated all the promising women of the past, and the new women only know how to perm their hair and apply makeup. Are Chinese women going to be forever mired?</p>
<p>After reading (The Light of Motherhood) and the articles by Mr. Lin Yutang and Tu Maoyong in Free Talk, I felt something and unconsciously picked up a pen to write these things. Here, I enthusiastically look forward to the awakening of Chinese women.</p>
<h3>In a Third-Class Train (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>Once a person heads north, they will feel themselves aging moment by moment. This feeling is especially acute for me, who has not been away from Guangdong for long, has seen the villages of the South, is accustomed to the food of the South, and is accustomed to breathing the air of the South. The bright green banyan trees of the South cannot be seen here. Everything here is shrouded in ancient, heavy shadows, and there is not a trace of the nimble and lively colors of the South. The stations along the Jinpu Railway are worth noting. Each large station has its own unique style. Although they are all Western-style old buildings, no two are the same. Some even remind people of churches.</p>
<p>Life on the train is very dull and monotonous. When there are many passengers, you can still see some special things. I saw a lot during my last trip. For example, an old woman was kicked out of the carriage because she didn't have a ticket and squatted on the corridor by the escalator, letting the cold night wind beat her. Another example is when a bandit came on board to catch an honest villager who was delivering money for someone. The villager was almost dragged off the train by him, but he was rescued by a railway policeman. The bandit jumped off while the train was moving. This time, I couldn't see or hear anything noteworthy. Passengers getting on and off at stations or buying food from vendors is the most common thing. Two cents for a roasted chicken and a cent for several pears are the most popular foods. Time passed slowly, but also uneventfully. I was lucky enough to have a good sleep at night, and when I woke up the next morning, the train had already passed Jinan.</p>
<p>The northern plains outside the window are somewhat lovely. Although there are few trees and only a few bald mountains, they can also evoke another kind of feeling. Calm, simple, without any exaggeration, without any concealment, the scenery of the North is like the people of the North. They silently bear the burden of life, perseveringly fight against difficulties, and do not utter a cry until they die.</p>
<p>Next to a station in Shandong province, people built a grass shed to hold a (memorial service.) The meeting has already ended, leaving behind couplets, an altar, and a portrait. It is said that the person being mourned was the railway policeman who was killed in the previous train robbery. It turns out that the Jinpu train was robbed by bandits in this area more than two weeks ago.</p>
<p>The train arrived at Tianjin East Station at a little after five o'clock in the afternoon. When I bought the ticket at the Shanghai China Travel Service, I troubled the ticket seller for a while about the problem of (East Station) and (Main Station). There were only tickets to Tianjin East Station there. At that time, I thought the train would arrive at (East Station) first and then (Main Station). Now I know that my memory was wrong. (The End)</p>
<h3>Passionate Child (3)</h3>
<p>— Translated by Ge Mang and Sai Zuo Zhuying</p>
<p>Early Sunday morning, he made his aunt mischievous. He didn't want the old collar; he wanted the higher one that she bought him when he made his first Holy Communion. He wanted to pair it with the blue tie with small floral dots. He looked in the dressing mirror in the living room: (Little beast, look; that's pretty enough, isn't it.) His aunt tied his bow tie with a pale smile on her face, like a patient's.</p>
<p>He set off trembling.</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>He was next to her, sitting on a narrow wooden stool, riding in an open carriage with two elderly people, heading to a forest in the countryside, like ascending to paradise. Also collecting some almond flower buds to tickle the back of his neck. He was intoxicated by the unknown fragrance on her, playing with her bracelet, the gold snake bracelet. After the carriage drove out of the Guoyue Forest, it was a new realm, more beautiful than anything he had dreamed of, as if her beautiful eyes could change everything. Suddenly, they delved into a clear, cool world. A green, transparent veil was spread over their heads, as light as a cloud; here, between the long pillars, was a lake of pale anemones, and a little further away was a lake of blue hyacinths. He discovered the forest hyacinths, he discovered the forest. They got out of the car; she ran for him like a child; (Ah... Ah... Is the doe there? She's in the woods.)</p>
<p>She was awakened by the birds singing in the spring (Sleeping Beauty in the Woods); she was Viviane, who mocked Merlin; she was the Genevieve de Brabant found in the herd of deer.</p>
<p>But Mr. Capelle was a little chilly, so Mrs. Capelle, who had been following them between the branches with her spirit of excitement, called out to them: (Hey! Hey!) They ran over, their faces red with joy. (Godmother, this is the charming prince who resurrected me.) They drove back through some revitalized pastures in the slanted shadows. The child's heart was filled with joy, a joy so beautiful that he didn't quite understand its source. She chatted with a smile, as if she felt happy to have him as a companion, and that made him content.</p>
<p>When everyone returned to the house at five o'clock, a young guest with gloves and elegant manners arrived. He sat down, seemingly a little flustered by an unexpected appearance. This was the first secretary to the successor of Mr. Capelle, the shipping broker. Mr. Capelle knew him when he was this tall. He lowered his eyes, his face flushed. Roger, who was watching him from the side, felt very uncomfortable in his heart. When she spoke to him, he interrupted her, interrupting and appearing rude. Everyone talked about the comings and goings of ships in the port and the affairs of the Chamber of Commerce, but he didn't listen. When the young man left, Mrs. Capelle playfully asked Miss White; (What do you think of this kid, huh?) She made a casual gesture, (He doesn't make me feel anything, he looks too stupid.) Roger felt greatly relieved after hearing this.</p>
<p>While waiting for dinner, everyone played the game (pigeon vote). Because Roger rarely spent an evening here, his eyes were shining, discovering some wit and mischievous behavior that even he himself didn't expect to have, all of which he had never used when he was at home with the two old people. (He's really funny, this Roger, this is a Roger, bontemps [French typical humorous figure]!) Mrs. Capelle said while she was busy. And the old man smiled in his snow-white beard, like Nestor, shining with ancient wisdom.</p>

<h3>Latest Vacuum Tube 2B6 Dual Triode</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Not long ago, the vacuum tube at the last stage of radio receivers; only triodes were used for Class A amplification. The characteristic of Class A amplification is that it can obtain better sound quality, but the efficiency is inevitably weakened; Later, the high-power pentode tube was introduced. Its strength is that it can output more power, so even weak external signal voltage can obtain a loud volume. However, its biggest drawback is that it is prone to distortion; To require a loud volume without distortion, the latest type of 2B6 vacuum tube must be used. The design purpose of this tube is to use a triode for Class A amplification and have extremely strong output power. The circuit of this vacuum tube, as shown in the figure, contains two triodes inside, so it is called a dual triode. It has only one filament (Healer), which supplies two separate cathodes. The screen grid of the output section is directly connected to the cathode of the input section inside the tube. The triode excited by the voltage inside the tube is called the input section, and the triode fed to the loudspeaker is called the output section.</p>
<p>Careful observation of the circuit reveals that the grid potential of the input section is obtained from the voltage drop on RO. The stable screen current of this input section is 3MA, and the grid resistor RO is 8000 obms, so the stable DC screen potential is 24 VOLTS. Note that there is no bypass capacitor connected across the two ends of this resistor. It is also important to note that the potential of the input screen grid is more negative than the cathode, so the screen grid of the input section does not consume power. The self-biasing resistor of the output cathode is 540 ohms, and the screen circuit DC is 40ma, so the voltage drop of R1 is 215. When the input screen grid does not receive external signal voltage, the output screen grid is connected to the input cathode, so its exact potential should be the difference between the voltage on R0 and R1, which is +25V. This extremely small positive potential causes a current of about ma in the output screen circuit. When the signal voltage is transmitted to the input section, the AC voltage is applied to the output screen grid, making its potential fluctuate, easily becoming positive or negative. This screen grid usually has only a very small positive potential. When the positive half-cycle of the external wave is present, its positive potential increases and the power consumption also increases, which means that more screen current is needed. Therefore, the change in the power of this screen grid is entirely automatically controlled by the effect of the input section. Note that the DC power taken by this vacuum tube when there is no signal is greater than that required during maximum excitation, so it is a Class A amplification type.</p>
<p>Even more special is the situation, even though the potential of the input screen grid is 24V, even with a signal voltage of 35V, the screen grid still cannot draw current. Because there is no bypass capacitor connected to R0, when the screen current changes, an AC voltage is generated in R0, which is 21V, so the maximum voltage actually applied to the input section is 35-21=14V, with an effective value of only 10V. This situation is called degeneration. Degeneration does not exist in the output section, because R1 has a 25mf bypass capacitor connected, which can maintain the voltage between the two ends of R1, stable and unchanged.</p>
<p>2B6 characteristic table is as follows;</p>
<p>Filament voltage 2.5V</p>
<p>Filament current 225 AMP</p>

<p>Screen voltage 250V Screen voltage 250</p>

<h3>Several Latest American Vacuum Tubes</h3>
<p>— Zai Ming</p>
<p>1.  12A5 is a high-power amplification pentode tube. In the heater diagram, the word "heat" has three terminals, which can be connected in parallel or in series at will. When connected in parallel, the voltage is six, three volts, and when connected in series, it is twelve, six volts. The screen voltage, screen current, and high-power output all have different values depending on the connection method. 2. IV This is a high-vacuum half-wave new rectifier tube. The heater voltage is six, three volts and can be used in 110-volt AC and DC and storage batteries (for automobiles) and other power sources.</p>
<p>2.  53 This is a heater cathode tube that puts two high-gain triodes in one glass bulb. So this tube can be used as a complete Class B amplifier. If they are connected in parallel, it becomes a Class A amplifier, which makes the drive tube behind it a Class B amplifier. Filament voltage two, five volts, screen voltage two hundred and fifty volts, high power output Class B about eight to ten watts.</p>
<p>3.  25S This is a specially made three-volt twin screen triode (Duodiodetriode) for detection and amplification. Suitable for air batteries. Its manufacture is similar to 55. Filament current 0.06 amps, screen voltage 135 volts.</p>
<h3>High-Frequency Coil Matching Method</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>After adding high-frequency amplification to the radio, coaxial capacitors must be used to obtain convenient adjustment. Otherwise, adjusting each stage is really too troublesome. We know that in a multi-stage high-frequency amplification circuit, if coaxial adjustment is used, not only can the capacitance of the capacitors not have any difference, but also the magnetic inductance of each high-frequency transformer must be exactly the same to obtain the most perfect effect.</p>
<p>Previously, everyone thought that the matching of such high-frequency coils was very cumbersome, so they had to buy ready-made ones. In fact, manufacturing and matching them yourself is not a difficult thing.</p>
<p>First, choose and wind any high-frequency amplification coil according to the attached table. Then connect the coil in parallel to a 0.0002mfd fixed capacitor. Then make the coil and the grid circuit coil of the regenerative radio wide coupling (Loosecoupling), and rotate C2 at the same time until a sound occurs in the headphones or the ammeter needle can just move. (In order to obtain further accuracy in matching, after the adjustment is completed, the high-frequency coil must be moved from far to near again. If the above phenomenon still occurs, it proves that they have indeed resonated with each other. The size and length of the second coil are the same as the first coil (it is better to wind half a turn more). The matching method is also as above. During matching, C1 C2 C3 and any other parts of the radio must not move at all. Only the first and last few turns of the second coil are allowed to be separated or tightened. When the headphones or ammeter change, it proves that the magnetic inductance of the first coil and the second coil are equal. (After the coils are matched, it is best to coat them with paraffin to avoid changing the magnetic inductance due to movement over time)</p>
<p>The matching method of the third and fourth coils is still the same as above, so I won't repeat it.</p>

<h3>Common Knowledge</h3>
<p>— Huang Jiancun</p>
<p>(15) Crystal Radio (1)</p>
<p>(1) General Introduction; ( ) "National Crystal Radio-ization!" This is a slogan used by Japan to mobilize the public and popularize broadcasting. Indeed, in today's world, amidst the economic panic, expensive vacuum tube radios are definitely not affordable for the general public. On the contrary, crystal radios are inexpensive, and their construction and maintenance are extremely simple. Even poor people can afford to buy one for just a few coins. This is the intention behind their call for "National Crystal Radio-ization." We can learn from others' experiences. We can also emulate their approach to popularize broadcasting and radio among our people. Here, crystal radios are worthy of our attention.</p>
<p>(2) Types of Crystal Detectors; The crystals used for detection currently include artificial crystals. Those with excellent sensitivity and stable operation include carbonized elements, silicon, zinc sulfide, zinc oxide, etc. As for natural mineral ores used as detectors with excellent sensitivity, there are quite a few, such as red zinc ore, wurtzite, galena, etc. Crystal detectors can also be divided into two types based on their structure: probe-type crystals and fixed-type crystals.</p>
<p>(I) Probe-type Crystal; As shown in Figure (1), an iron needle is installed on the crystal dish to make contact with the crystal and search for the point with the highest sensitivity. Although this type of probe-type crystal can achieve good sensitivity, even a slight vibration will immediately change the contact point between the iron needle and the crystal, resulting in decreased sensitivity. This is an unsatisfactory aspect of probe-type crystals, but their cost is relatively low.</p>
<p>(2) Fixed-type Crystal; As shown in Figure (2), a spiral iron wire is installed on a small piece of crystal to fix the point of optimal crystal sensitivity. If this type of crystal is subjected to excessive impact, it will lose its sensitivity. Once the sensitivity is lost, it is not easy to recover. Therefore, it must be handled with care and avoid being subjected to impact. Also, when there is lightning approaching on cloudy days, fixed-type crystals are often impacted by electricity and lose their sensitivity. Therefore, do not listen to broadcasts during thunderstorms.</p>

<h3>Honeycomb Coil Winding Method</h3>
<p>— Ren Rong</p>
<p>Experience tells us that among many coil types, the honeycomb coil (Bobineeuniddahielles) is the most economical. Both the position and materials used meet the conditions of economy. The winding method first involves preparing a wooden axis, approximately 4 to 6 cm in diameter and similar in height. Twenty-four pins are evenly inserted along the edges of the upper and lower ends, approximately fourteen degrees per pin (Figure A is a top view, and Figure B is a side view of the axis). It does not matter whether the winding starts on the upper or lower row. The number of pins skipped from one row to another is called the "step" (Pasodenooulment). According to winding habits, the step alternates between even and odd numbers. This depends on half of the total number of pins inserted on either the upper or lower side. Half of twenty-four pins is twelve pins, which is an even-numbered step. An odd-numbered step is half plus one, which equals thirteen. As shown in Figure B, winding line 24 丨 13 丨 1 丨 14 丨 2 丨 15 丨 3 丨 16 丨 4 丨 17 丨 5 丨 18 丨 6 丨 19 丨 7 丨 20 丨 8 丨 21 丨 9 丨 22 丨 10 丨 23 丨 11 丨 24 丨 12 丨 1 丨 13 丨···· Continue winding in this manner. From the bottom, 24 丨 13, and then from 13 丨 1 to complete one turn (Spire). Winding the wire once over all forty-eight pins above and below is called one layer (Coudbe). After winding, secure it with thread, apply glue, and wait for it to dry. Then, remove the pins and install it on the support frame. There are other winding methods that will be discussed later. (Ren Rong's Note: This article is a simplified translation of a French document, so the original French names are retained for accuracy.)</p>
<h3>Adjustment Method and Steps for Shortwave Transmitters (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Luo Jing</p>
<p>The method for performing leveling is as follows:</p>
<p>(A) After the oscillator starts oscillating, ignite the amplifier filament and apply the grid voltage. However, the plate voltage should only be applied after the leveling is completed.</p>
<p>(B) Use a small light bulb, connect it to the two coils, and place it close to the plate circuit, on the side connected to the plate. Then, slightly turn the plate capacitor to make the small light bulb glow slightly. After it glows, slightly increase the degree of the leveling capacitor CN. At the same time, increase the plate capacitor again to make the small light bulb brighter. Repeat this process several times until the small light bulb goes from slightly bright to very bright and then goes out. At this point, the leveling capacitor is approximately 10% to 20% less than the true leveling capacitance. If we gradually increase the two capacitors as before, the small light bulb will glow again when the degree is reached. At this point, it is approximately 10% to 20% of the true leveling capacitance. If we place the leveling capacitor between these two degrees, then the amplifier's leveling work is considered complete.</p>
<p>(C) However, to ensure that our leveling is reliable, we need to find a clear indication. The method can be done according to the following two points; (A) The degree of the determined leveling capacitor does not need to be changed, only rotate the plate capacitor to see if the pointer of the previous stage's plate milliampere meter jumps; if it does not jump because of this, it has been proven to be reliable. (B) If a milliampere meter is placed in the grid circuit, the situation is the same, and the standard for judging the success or failure of leveling is whether the pointer on the meter jumps or not. Once the method for adjusting each single stage of the amplifier is as described above, then as long as each stage is leveled, the plate voltage can be applied, and the plate circuit can be slightly adjusted to start the work of the next stage. If it goes in this order to the last stage, then the amplification part of the entire transmitter has completed its own leveling purpose.</p>
<p>(4) After the amplifier has been leveled, it is then delivered to the antenna to level the antenna circuit. The method is the same as in the single-oscillation type.</p>
<p>(5) The last step is to verify whether the leveling of each stage is reliable? Therefore, after each stage and antenna circuit are leveled, just leave the plate switch of the exciter, and the readings of the milliampere meter of each stage's plate must fall to zero. If a certain stage does not fall to zero, then this stage must have self-oscillation; and we must carefully re-level it properly. (End)</p>
<h3>Economical Two-Tube Radio</h3>
<p>— Ke Rongyan</p>
<p>We know that there are many types of radios. Because they use special connection methods, they can obtain higher efficiency with a small number of vacuum tubes, such as regenerative and reflex types, which are all circuits with good efficiency. What is said here is also a type of economical and powerful. Its principle is to use a crystal for detection, and on the one hand, use a vacuum tube to generate oscillation to help it amplify, which is also a heterodyne type. When installed well, it has a greater effect than an ordinary three-tube machine. Below is the circuit of this type of radio;</p>
<p>In the above diagram, L1 has 50 turns, tap at 20 or 15 turns, L2 has 60 turns, L3 has 48 turns, CI and C2 can use 0.0046 MFD variable capacitors, T1 and L2 are both 35:1 low-frequency transformers, V1 can use A109, then V2 can use B105, if 199 is used, then V2 can use 120, but when using 099, L3 should have more turns than when using A109, approximately 50 some turns. All three coils are wound in a spiderweb style. A grid resistor and capacitor can also be installed at the X on the upper right. After the entire machine is assembled, it can be tested.</p>
<p>This type of radio saves electricity, so the power supply can be provided by a battery. The sound quality is very clear and bright. A small two-tube machine can use a small speaker to play sound. Readers may wish to try it. However, according to the author's experience, it is better to use A109 and B105 for V1 and V2.</p>
<h3>News Briefs</h3>
<p>Overseas School Radio Broadcast</p>
<p>The German Breslau station will soon have regular broadcast programs to facilitate German schools abroad. It is said that the station's broadcasts can be heard in most parts of the globe.</p>
<p>American Wireless Television</p>
<p>Columbia Broadcasting System has decided to stop its wireless television broadcasts in New York. This broadcast began in July 1931, and the total number of broadcast segments to date has reached 2,500 hours. The reason for its termination is that it has not been able to attract general public attention since 1931 until now. The number of wireless television receivers is still limited and shows no signs of increasing. Therefore, there is no need to continue broadcasting.</p>
<p>Currently, there are thirty locations in the United States broadcasting wireless television, half of which are near New York.</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>Now there is a Philips radio, the machine is perfect, easy to tune, guaranteed use, ready to be installed, even more suitable for suburban areas. The owner purchased a new one and is willing to sell it for one hundred yuan. If interested, please visit or write to Mr. Wang of the Shenbao Newspaper Advertisement Department for contact.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment: Thank you to Mr. Cheng Fan Fengyuan for gifting a copy of his new book, The Manufacturing of Experimental Dry Batteries. Mr. Fan has been researching the manufacturing method of dry batteries for a long time. He has collected various dry batteries from home and abroad, experimented with the advantages and disadvantages, and obtained a standard paste manufacturing method. Therefore, he wrote this book to publish it to the world, and also openly teaches. He is willing to answer all letters and face-to-face inquiries in detail. This serves as an introduction.</p>

<p>Discussion</p>
<p>Ambiguous Language Yuan Zhi</p>
<p>In linguistics, several words with different forms and sounds but the same meaning are called "Synonyms." If the sounds are the same but the forms and meanings are different, it is "Paronym." When listening to conversations, reading, and writing, the latter inevitably leads to misunderstandings.</p>
<p>The Chinese character's (phonetic loan) is also a troublesome thing, and its nature is comparable to that of Paronym, but it is a case of the same form but different meanings. That type of Paicmvm from abroad does not pose a problem in Chinese.</p>
<p>However, the most problematic thing in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad, is many words with the same sound and form but indefinite meanings. What is referred to as (Tao), (Body), and (The Absolute One) in Metaphysics and philosophy, which have created much confusion, make it difficult for people to understand. Even many very common words today, are their meanings clear?</p>
<p>Let's look at a few examples;</p>
<p>(Socialism) is a well-known term, but its definition is not certain. If you look at what it encompasses, sometimes it is said to be limited to communism, and sometimes anarchism, the Three Principles of the People······; etc. are also included, and the boundaries are no longer clear. This year, a publication even referred to fascism as socialism. From now on, when I meet someone who calls himself a (socialist), it is difficult to know whether he is a Stalinist or a Hitlerite, and I am full of suspicion.</p>
<p>Another household name is (Revolution). Its meaning is also becoming increasingly ambiguous. This group of people calls themselves (revolutionaries) and kills another group of people. Another group of people also calls themselves (revolutionaries) and kills this group of people. Group after group, revolution after revolution, the more revolutionary it becomes, the more complex it becomes, so that when we see people calling themselves (revolutionaries), we are also at a loss.</p>
<p>In this situation, how can we not hesitate when doing things, and how can we not be ambiguous when speaking?</p>
<p>The French literary giant Voltaire (Vcitaire) once said: (If you want to talk to me, first define the words you use!) I used to think his words were too (solemn), but now I know that this is indeed an honest statement. Conversations with unclear definitions are indeed annoying and dangerous. Now there are many academic disputes, often with both sides standing on the same position, using the same weapons, for the same purpose, and attacking each other, causing great damage, but the result is still confusing. This is also because everyone does not clarify the definitions of the terms they use first.</p>
<p>It is not difficult to clarify the definition of a term, of course, but people today do not want you to understand it and deliberately want to make it ambiguous and contradictory. This is a tactic, a smokescreen.</p>
<p>Is the shield made of gold or silver? The original presentation is clear when viewed on both sides, but people only allow you to see the front. Is the elephant like a wall or a stick? Even if you are blind, you can understand it if you touch the whole body, but people only allow you to touch the skin.</p>
<p>In addition to Paronym, there is also Ambiguity, which is also an annoying thing. There is a famous legend about this;</p>
<p>The Apollo Shrine in ancient Greece was a very divine place, and people who went there to seek predictions were constantly coming and going. Once, King Croesus of Lydia wanted to start a war with Persia, so he also went there to predict the outcome. The god indeed descended and prophesied that: (A great country will perish). Croesus was overjoyed and thought that Persia would perish, so he declared war. In the end, the god's prophecy was fulfilled, but the empire that perished was not Persia, but Croesus's own Lydia.</p>
<p>What is currently being rumored in China as (diplomatic change) is also an Apollo-style ambiguous language. We have no way of predicting which direction it will change to. It is too early for anyone to be happy or sad about this.</p>

<h3>Anthology of Nonsense Preface by Yi Ping</h3>
<p>Skipping class seems to be disrespectful to people, like principals and professors. But going to class means having to listen to those people. So I just daydream in the classroom. Because sometimes I think (widely) and (deeply), I think I have something comparable to things buried in the soil), so I'm not afraid to waste ink and write it down. The title "Anthology of Nonsense" has the meaning of "Heaven knows" opposite the big stage. This is the preface. Amen.</p>
<p>(Laughter and crying are only separated by a piece of paper.) These words seem to be said by Tsurumi Yusuke of Japan. They are really wonderful words! Now I especially believe it. Isn't that right? Don't prostitutes greet guests with a smile? Don't new brides cry loudly when they get into the sedan chair? Moreover, it is said that a certain socialite cried when she first received a man's letter of love.</p>
<p>Friends come, but I don't have money to buy tea. I tell them that drinking plain water is hygienic. I don't have money to make a suit, so I say that suits are too troublesome and long gowns are more convenient. Friends also ask about my love life. I don't have money, so I love but don't dare to love. So I say: (Studying is for the time when you're learning. If you fall in love, it will interfere with your studies.) So I don't love, nor do I love.) Friends retreat with agreement.</p>
<p>Women who proclaim celibacy are telling the opposite sex that they don't have a suitable lover.</p>
<p>I often see many works signed (Ms.) in newspapers or magazines. I don't know if the two words (Ms.) are written by the so-called Ms. herself, or added by the editor after considering the content and handwriting of the article?</p>
<p>The big guy Xiao Huang once said hatefully: (He would very much like to have a few more wars in China so that more people can die, and almost all of these deaths are men; so maybe I will have a little more chance to get a woman that no one else wants.) This is so cruel and so pitiful!</p>
<p>When the butcher stabs the pig's neck with a sharp knife, the pig resists only by shouting loudly; because it only shouts and does not act, the pig is always a lowly animal that is slaughtered by others!</p>
<p>I don't quite believe that you lose consciousness after drinking a few glasses of wine. At least I am very clear in my mind. After drinking wine, crying, laughing, and doing strange things, although it is deceiving, it is also a pleasure to stun people who are still clear-headed and focus their eyes on you.</p>
<p>We heard that Jehovah God created the world. He looked at everything he had created and thought it was very good. What else can he say now?</p>
<p>After Jehovah created a man, Adam, he thought that Adam had too few things to do in the world. So he took a bone from Adam's body and created a woman, Eve. Jehovah then stood aside and watched the fun.</p>
<p>A female student wrote in her diary: (This semester, I spent a total of one hundred and thirty-seven yuan, two jiao and five cents on cosmetics.)</p>
<p>Believing that I have a little bit of intelligence, I used this intelligence to create many waking dreams on weekdays. In my dreams, I was so angry that I innocently killed people, but my conscience punished me and said: (Don't take it too seriously, the world is not yours!)</p>
<p>The bookstore clerk told the young female customer: (This fountain pen is not very good-looking, but it writes very well!) The female customer frowned and said slightly angrily: (Who wants it to write?)</p>
<p>There are many women whose faces are very beautiful, their learning is also good, and their posture and speech are not annoying, but they cannot touch people's (love) hearts; and there are many women, no matter how their faces and learning are, they make people (love) them at first sight, so I believe in the saying that (beauty is in the eye of the beholder).</p>
<p>I am now also in love with a woman, this woman I have never seen, maybe she does not exist in this world.</p>
<p>The best taste of love is when you can't get it.</p>
<p>You have to be careful of the person who is hit by you and does not fight back. He does not forgive you, nor does he allow you to forgive yourself!</p>
<p>A friend said: (Love is pain.) A friend said: (The secret of love is to endure the pain.) I was so scared that I couldn't speak.</p>
<p>A old dog wrote in his diary (People don’t eat the leftover soup and bones that the chef drops. Fools!)</p>
<p>(Down with imperialism!) Sure enough, imperialism was knocked down by this wave of sound; but, unfortunately, I heard that he immediately stood up again.</p>
<p>A naive elementary school student hugged his female teacher's leg and said intimately and frankly: (Teacher, you are so beautiful, as beautiful as my family's pug, especially the hair on your head.)</p>
<p>A person who has truly laughed once is definitely not a bad person!</p>
<p>Most modern women sell themselves, and they say to everyone who buys them: (I love you, because you are not as annoying as the others!)</p>
<p>A love letter wrote: (Enclosed is a five-cent Ah Sin stamp.)</p>
<p>I really want to die the day before I graduate from college, so that people can sigh and say: (What a pity! This promising young man! If he didn't die, he would definitely be able to······)</p>
<p>Postscript</p>
<p>I won’t write anymore. One day has passed. If I don’t die tomorrow, or if I get a serious illness, I still have to see what the amusement of the lecturer is like. Today, the empress looked at me for a long time, thinking that I was going to compile some more words and publish them on the wall newspaper. Her lip-sticked cherry lips moved, probably she was scolding me. Good! I will invite her to my second collection of nonsense.</p>
<h3>Flowers, Vases, or Vase Stands?</h3>
<p>Everyone knows that flower vases are for holding flowers, and vase stands are for placing vases on. If flowers are picked and not put in a vase, they will lack vitality. If a vase does not have a stand, it will also be less beautiful. These three things are related and are all for people to appreciate.</p>
<p>Now, people who destroy women's careers generally use the name (vase) as a nickname for female office workers in institutions, meaning to say without any politeness; that female office workers in institutions are simply not there to do things, but to be placed there as decorations for people to appreciate. Of course, this is something that cannot be denied. Of course, it cannot be said that there are absolutely no (vases) among female office workers in institutions. However, you can't arbitrarily say that all female office workers in institutions are (vases). Because I wanted to go to work in an institution, I don’t know how many jeers I received from relatives and friends, saying whether I also wanted to be a (vase). Alas, although I know very well that I will not be a (vase), and I am not qualified to be a (vase), my future has been greatly affected. Therefore, I feel greatly angry about the danger of the future of women's professional liberation. The person who created this name is too insulting to female compatriots! In any case, we must never admit the saying that (female office workers in institutions are all vases). Even if those female office workers who dress up beautifully and sit in the office are (vases), then I want to ask, what are those slick-haired, snow-cream-wearing, perfume-spraying young men in suits? Female office workers dress up for people to appreciate, are male office workers' dresses needed for their official duties? If female office workers dress up, they will be given a (vase) nickname, but male office workers dress up and no one says anything. There is absolutely no such cheap logic in the world. I think these guys should also be given a name, and they should be treated the same as those female office workers. I have carefully observed that men's dresses are almost always following women's dresses, that is; where there are more (vases), there are more of these men. You can see that in places where there are no (vases), the male office workers' dresses are much simpler or more informal. Once there are (vases), they will immediately change their appearances. Judging from this, aren't they clearly trying to work hard on their appearance to please the (vases)? Aren't they sitting there overly dressed and groomed to make the (vases) appreciate them? Aren't they also becoming decorations in the office? Therefore, they have a close relationship with (vases). Therefore, I think of the flowers inserted in the vase and the stand under the vase. Instead of calling them artificial flowers, it is more appropriate to call them vase stands. I would like to invite everyone to discuss this.</p>
