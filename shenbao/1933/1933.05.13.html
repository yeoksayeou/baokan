<h3>所望於華北政委會</h3>
<p>最近中央鑒於華北形勢緊急。軍事之策劃與治安之維持。在在需有强有力之最高機關。負責籌劃。始足以收連絡呼應之效。於是乃有華北政務委員會之設立。今者委員長黄郛行且北上就職。是華北政委會之重大使命。於茲即將開始。吾人於此。殊不能無一言以爲華北政委會勗</p>
<p>最近華北形勢之危殆。蓋已幾等於幕上之燕巢。敵軍旣强佔熱河。復以雷霆萬鈞之力。南向挺進。勃勃野心。天下共見。此時北方所賴以抵禦强敵。保平津於一線者。僅有少數苦戰已久之部隊。而敵則挾利器。動大軍。疾風捲地而來。二十餘日前去北平僅百餘里之密雲。旣已被炸。而今日北平天空。又已發見敵機。平津形勢之危急。蓋爲吾人所能預料。平津而失。則華北盡去。言念及此。吾人誠不勝其悲憤與哀痛。而華北政委會適於此產生。以肩負此危局。其亟應堅固團結羣力以應付之者一也。</p>
<p>邇者敵軍攻奪我長城各要隘。一面復以金錢收買大批無恥落伍之流氓與政客。潛入平津。密謀響應。如最近被北平愛國青年擊死於六國飯店之張敬堯。即其一例。然此不過幸而爲我北平愛國青年所發覺耳。其他爲敵軍所收買。潛伏於華北各地。甘心爲虎作倀。而未及發覺者。當猶大有人在。此種喪盡天良之輩。誡爲我民族之公敵。華北政委會於維護華北大局之中。尤應嚴密注意於此一點務使此等醜類。無所托足。密謀無所得逞。以保後方之安謐。二也。</p>
<p>張學良之所以覆敗。在於終始不謀抵抗。喪地辱國。故爲國人所共棄。今華北政委會旣已成立。則於政治之外。必更着目於軍事。求其所以異於張學良者換言之。即向之不抵抗者。今必易爲積極抵抗。而後可以副國家付託之重。而後可以副人民殷切之望。三也。</p>
<p>事急矣。勢危矣。今日華北之危急存亡。僅存一線。我華北政委會臨危受命。其究將何以任勞任怨。盡心竭力以維護之。使平津不爲遼吉黑與熱河之續。以延國命於萬一乎。此一艱難鉅責。令已置之華北政委會諸君子之肩頭。諸君子其念之。</p>
<h3>出售中東路證實</h3>
<h3>蘇俄力避與日衝突</h3>
<p>異哉李維諾夫之言！</p>
<p>竟謂中政府十八個月未能履行義務</p>
<p>認爲已喪失協定中所載道德的權利</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄外委李維諾夫今日述及中國要求與聞俄「滿間中東鐵路爭案事、據蘇俄半官通訊社消息、李氏謂南京政府或在其管理下之握權者對中東鐵路已終止與蘇聯爲實在之合夥人、蓋按照北平瀋陽協定、中政府必須派代表列席於該路局也、惟已過之十八個月内、中政府未派一代表、故已失其協定中所載道德的權利、李氏次述及一九二九年中俄爭端、謂俄政府爲消除衝突之原起見、曾與中國代表莫德惠談判出售中東鐵路事、但此項談判、爲滿洲事變所打斷、因此種種原因、吾人乃提議出售該路、吾人之建議、乃蘇俄注重和平之表示、且北平瀋陽協定並未予中國以在相當時期前贖回該路之權、亦未限制蘇俄不得以該路售與任何國、尤其爲今確已在滿州並履行北平瀋陽協定中國之擔任之國、中國已十八個月不能在滿洲履行其擔任、故彼已失其抗議出售中東鐵路之道德的權利、李氏又謂駐莫斯科中國大使顏惠慶博士已默認中國已無在滿洲履行其義務之能力云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇聯確曾提議出賣中東路於日本或「滿洲國」此事業由蘇聯外長李維諾夫於對塔斯社之答問中證實之、李氏云、「余與日大使太田之談話中、確曾提起由「滿國」當局之行動所造成中東路之嚴重形勢、及其足以增重蘇聯與日「滿」糾紛之問題、爲謀一可能之解决糾紛辦法、余乃提起由「滿洲國」贖回中東路之可能、意即由蘇聯以中東路出賣於滿洲當局、作爲解决目前困難之一最急斷方法也、中國政府、亦確曾來電詢問此事、反對蘇聯政府以中東路出賣於中國政府以外之任何人、中國大使爲此事亦曾致一備忘錄於我國、惟中國政府所舉之理由、與蘇聯政府之正式條約承諾及事態之實際狀况、均有未符之處、中俄及奉俄協定中、未規定中國在適當期限前贖回中東路之權、亦未限制蘇聯以該路售之他人、尤以對方爲滿洲之一現存勢力、且在實際上行使中俄及奉俄協定中之華方權利義務者、更有在最近之十八月來事實上中國政府及其統屬勢力在中東路上已中止爲蘇聯之實際共營者、此種可能之失去、非由於蘇聯之故、惟中國政府已不能依照中俄及奉俄協定行使其權利及義務、在過去十八月中、中國政府亦不能依照條約留其代表於中東路理事會、對於滿洲當局之破壞中東路權益、中國政府已不能訴告、亦未設法保障該路之常態工作、故中國政府在十八月來之未能完盡中俄及奉俄協定中之義務、使彼失去自協定所取得之正式及道德權利、當現任中國駐莫斯科大使顏惠慶博士與余在日内瓦談判恢復中蘇邦交時、顏使提議雙方應換文承認中俄及奉俄協定之不可侵犯性、余接受此議、惟加以保留、謂滿洲之形勢轉雙、應使中國政府不失去其完盡協定責任之可能、當時中國政府反對此種保留、因其在事實上爲不可能也、余以爲以上所述、已證明中國政府不能反對蘇聯之出售中東路、尤指出賣於滿洲當局而言、至於蘇聯出售中東路之動機、則可略舉如下、沙皇政府之建造中東路於外國之滿洲境地、無疑爲由於帝國主義之目的、蘇聯政府從未有此種目的、十月革命後、中東路已中止爲一侵略之工具、惟因該路之建築費出自蘇聯民衆、故蘇聯政府不得不保護其所有權及在路上之利益、蘇聯政府常欲以該路售諸中國惟後者不能購買之、故爲保護其所有權及在路上之利益、蘇聯政府改此路爲一純粹之商業經營、又因其通行於外國境土、乃以同等之管理權及半份之贏餘贈與該境土之主人、以示公正、然而中東路常成爲蘇聯中國與滿洲之一糾紛來源、吾人當均能憶及一九二九年在中東路之衝突、爲去除此種衝突之來源、蘇聯政府於一九三○年與瀋陽及中國政府之代表莫德惠談判出賣中東路之事、此項談判至一九三一年秋因滿洲事變之發生而中止、現則出售中東路之問題又告成熟、由於上述之理由、蘇聯提議出賣中東路、吾等之提議已屢示蘇聯政府之和平意願、吾等以爲反對此事者、或出於願望日俄或俄滿關係嚴重化之理由」云、（十一日塔斯社電）</p>

<h3>軍縮化險爲夷</h3>
<p>五强接受折衷方案</p>
<p>星期一開總委員會</p>
<p>能否通過尙屬疑問</p>
<p>路透十二日日内瓦電漢德森挽救軍縮會議僵局之折衷方案、已由五大列强代表接受、如於星期一日經總委員會贊同、則可使僵局之形勢和緩、第英德意見仍不能因此接近、不過可將德國之要求範圍昭示世界耳、</p>
<p>路透十二日日内瓦電軍縮會議主席漢德森今日努力設法擬調和英德之意見、聞已籌得折衷方案、將於本月十五日召集總委員會、俾同時討論兵額及物質上軍縮問題、聞此方案可爲德代表那杜尼所接受、明日將提交主幹部、至於能否得多數贊同、尙屬疑問、</p>
<h3>五强會一度失敗</h3>
<p>路透社十二日日内瓦電昨夜五强開第二度會議、討論軍縮會僵局、結果依然失敗、關於應採之手續、迄無諒解、五强代表今日將向主幹委員會提出報告、軍縮會總委員會大約將於星期六日广會考慮時局、</p>
<p>路透十一日内瓦電軍縮會議現確瀕於危境、英代表艾登與德代表那杜尼雖自三日前軍縮會形成僵局以來、屢作私人談話、但終未有何諒解也、德外長所發軍縮會失敗、則德國將重修軍備之驚人言論、尤使日内瓦裂痕愈臻廣大、今日午後五强開會、由漢德森主席、英代表艾登報告談判不成之經過情形、今夜五强代表將再開會、繼續討論、但衆料未必能覓獲最後方案、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯十一日日内瓦電近數日以來英國代表爲歐洲軍制統一問題、屢與德國代表那多尼進行談話、本日美國意大利及法國代表、由下午五時起至七時止舉行會議、由漢德森主席、先後與英代表艾登及德代表那多尼談話、英代表將渠與那多尼接洽情形報告三國代表、謂雖經數次商洽迄無效果、殊以爲歉、那多尼對各代表所言、在純粹理論上雖似接受歐洲軍制統一案、但對英國提出種種保留及不能承認之種種條件、事實上等於拒絕、故現所討論者爲軍縮會議以後應取如何途徑、各主要國代表認爲形勢旣已如此、即應將此種情形先後提交主席團及總委員會、明白討論之、以便確切證明意見之參差、並確定德國政府應負之責任、英法兩國代表尤係如此主張、晚間九時、各代表將重行開會、以結束談話、大約各代表將主張明日下午、召集軍縮會議主席團、星期六召集總委員會、以决定軍縮會議之運命云、</p>
<h3>德外長强硬論調</h3>
<p>路透社十一日柏林電德國萊齊浦格書報今日登載德外長牛賴特一文、預料軍縮會失敗、屆時德政府將重修軍備、該文謂日内瓦討論已經十五個月、但其結果已表明德國軍備平等之要求毫無成就、其故以軍備充實之國、未有軍縮之誠意也、英國計畫範圍内之一般軍備限制或縮减、無論其氣象如何、且縱使如此縮减、然亦强令德國補充軍備之性質、英國計畫雖可歡迎、認爲趨向實際解决之一種切實的努力、然在關於實施或承認德國平等要求之細則上、殊不能爲德國所滿意、故關於此兩點、英國計畫尙須修改云、</p>
<h3>英陸相痛加枰擊</h3>
<p>路透十一日倫敦電陸相海爾珊今日在貴族院言及軍縮問題、謂若德國不願參加英國提案之討論、或退出軍縮會議、則德國直拒絕履行諾言之建議、而將負軍縮失敗之責任、渠希望德國改採較合情理之態度、縱德國不欲變其態度、亦未必即退出軍縮會議、但若德國竟退出軍縮會、則其他各國將採行何種途徑、此誠爲應得、最嚴重考慮之事件、依渠個人意見、法律上結果、將爲德國須受凡爾賽和約條文之拘束、凡重治軍備之舉動、乃破壞和約之行爲、將使和約所載之懲戒條文見諸實行、德國若脫離軍縮會議、而宣佈不欲爲凡爾賽和約所束縛、則渠信德國之隣國未必認德國之行爲爲滿意、而能依允大减軍縮之辦法也云、</p>
<h3>法外部力持鎭靜</h3>
<p>路透社十一日巴黎電今晚報紙以大字登載德外長牛賴特所發如軍縮會議失敗、則德國將重修軍備之說、但法外部則依然鎭靜、謂德外長之論文、僅又爲德國一種示威舉動而已云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯十一日里昻電赫禮歐前總理宣稱、渠將於適宜時間說明急進社會黨（即現政府黨）外交政策之大綱、又謂日前英相麥唐納在下議院宣言、「美政府準備援助歐洲保持安寗、如軍縮會議能得到具體效果、則美國可以參加諮詢條約、俾感受戰爭危險之國家得以增加安全」</p>
<p>云云、渠對麥氏此項宣言、極表欣幸、美國可以參加國際行動、保持安全一舉、極關重要、由麥氏之言、可見英國業已了然矣云云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯十二日日内瓦電捷克外長彭納斯已於今晨抵此、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯十二日羅馬尼亞京城電羅馬尼亞外長蒂杜樓斯哥昨晚啓程、前往日内瓦參預軍縮會議工作、並籌備小協商各國常設政治會議開會事宜、</p>
<p>世人不歡迎</p>
<h3>希特勒代表</h3>
<p>英人要求驅逐羅森培</p>
<p>路透十一日倫敦電今日下院質問時、工黨議員數人請内務大臣哲爾摩囑德國國家社會黨代表羅森培束裝返國、反對黨領袖藍斯堡聲稱、政府待遇法西斯黨及共產黨宣傳人、實大相逕庭云、哲爾摩後答稱、如羅氏果有違反英國利益之行動、則自當令其出境云、藍斯堡繼請議長准其動議延會、俾討論容許德國法西斯黨宣傳人入境事、藍氏又謂、法西斯之敎訓、志在推倒英國國會與憲法云、藍氏之動議爲議長拒絕、</p>
<p>路透十一日倫敦電德總理希特勒之代表羅森培刻在倫敦、今夜在旅館招待英國新聞記者、但招待時旅館外適有共產黨之示威行動、共產黨集於門外、大呼「逐出羅森培」、旋與警察衝突、結果有兩人被拘、羅森培對新聞記者發簡短之詞、謂德國革命之目的、在恢復社會和平、渠對於德國境内所發生之事件、不欲作歉詞、至於外人指摘德國拘禁政治犯一節、則須知六千五百萬德人之自由、較諸少數共產黨之自由、更有價値、德政府今後將更注重德國工人之利益、甚於從前、國家社會黨在過去十四年中、死三百人、傷二萬人、其死傷數之衆、逈非德國現所拘禁之人數所可比疑、至於對猶太人之暴行、可屈指可數、並不甚多云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯十二日維也納電德國若干閣員來奥游歷之期已近特於啓程之前、發表公告、謂奥國若對德國閣員採取　視行動、則柏林方面即視此種態度、爲對德國政府及其首長而發云云、奥京人士、因此極爲煩躁不安警察局决定德國閣員抵此時、國社黨人物前往歡迎者、不得過二十人、並限定國社黨歡迎儀節、只准舉行一次云、</p>
<p>國民十一日維也納電德閣員等將於星期六日下午二時三十分抵維也納航空站、然後將分乘汽車過市、本星期内奥國有數種報紙曾對德國社黨表示惡感、但奥國社黨豫料奥京民衆將予德閣員以熱烈之歡迎</p>

<h3>大兵壓境的沽源（續）</h3>
<p>本報特派員　國·安·</p>
<p>（三）蔡縣長叫苦連天</p>
<p>由軍部出來、又轉進入縣政府、坐在縣長的辦公廳裏、在一種愁苦的空氣裏蔡清禪縣長有時皺緊了眉頭、有時勉强作着苦笑、把沽源縣民不聊生的苦况、很誠懇的在他的嘴裏流露出來、</p>
<p>紅卍字會第五隊在遷安臨時治療所醫被炸傷民</p>
<p>「沽源在民國五年綫設治、於該年八月四日、由獨石口原縣城、遷到沽源、十四年起修築縣城、十六年工竣、沽源的形勢、係因長城劃治、所以爲狹長形、東西寬約四十餘里、南北長四百餘里、東北接多倫、西北靠寳昌、正西爲張北縣、西南是赤城·和延慶、西南爲懷柔密雲、東南爲灤平、正東爲豐寗、</p>
<p>沽源的田賦很輕、正稅和附稅、每畝地平均不過六元上下、統共全縣田畝約近萬頃（一頃約十畝）、庫欵兩萬七千元、每年徵收田賦、約可得八成之譜、每月行政費六百九十餘元、司法費約三百餘元、四局及各校、共需洋三千五百元、還有地方警團各費每月也得三千元、臨時費一個月也得一千元上下、可是由去年起、設立維持會、供應軍隊給養、所有消耗各費、一天比一天的增加、（維持會歸地方辦理、由全縣按地攤欵）</p>
<p>全縣有一萬五千多户、人丁男女十萬口、以山西山東河北三省遷來者爲多、土著甚少、蒙旗民不過百分之一二、人民務農者約占百分九十、營工商業者甚少、讀書識字就不用提、說起本縣敎育僅有完全小學三處、師範傳習所一處、文化的落後、就可想而知了、</p>
<p>縣街上没有大商號、城裏小攤小舖、也就十幾家、本縣的出產、一區和二區、農產以莜麥爲大宗、間有小麥、其餘如蔴子油菜子蕎麥菀豆而已、再有羊皮羊毛狐皮、還有藥材如赤芍黄苓防風升麻車前子黄茋馬前子知母蒼术甘草等、第三第四兩區農產物比較的多一點、有小麥高梁吉豆小米大米、又有蠶絲蜂蜜杏仁等產品、但皆未發達三四兩區、多山嶺、很宜於植樹、菓木樹也很適宜、可惜没有經營、這是本縣的大槪狀况、目前的情形、更是苦不堪言、本縣向來是貧瘠出名的、自從十五年後、連遭荒旱、杆子（土匪）遍地、二十·二十一兩年、雖然收成還不錯、但是穀賤傷農、地方的窮苦、一毫都没有解决、本縣是以莜麥爲大宗、價錢最便宜、每石祇賣一元八角、所以年頭的好壞、還没有多大的關係、老百姓的收入、全倚賴着牧塲、因本縣是天然的牧塲、牧養一道、是老百姓的副業、家家如此、牛羊驢馬、每一個大户、都是成千累萬的、就是小户人家、也有個數十頭或百餘頭、但是最近杆子弄的太厲害、又没有正式軍隊駐剿、所倚恃地方的圑警、不能作充分的保護、所以老百姓的牲畜、都被杆子搶去、於是老百姓也不敢再牧養、那麽這様一來、大户中落、小户更窮的没有飯吃了、最近更加上賦稅的增加、攤欵的繁重、老百姓還能活嗎、</p>
<p>你想、本縣現在的財政、不用說是破產了、想盡了方法和手段、也不中用呵、以前是杆子走了兵來、老百姓逃亡之餘、難得安定、地方的收入、都靠着田賦的附加、以外　是攤欵、老百姓正賦都拿不起、還能辦到攤欵嗎、更加上軍隊過境、徵索大車、本縣被派三套馬車三十輛、因爲地方没有這様的大車、改由民間攤欵購買、每輛車攤洋三百元、連同送費一起計算就得一萬元左右、本縣送十二輛已經就筋疲力盡了前後軍隊過境總數、約五六萬名、有的駐上二三天就走、有的隨到隨走、但是索車輛、民扶給養、這些損</p>
<p>境的也不下兩三萬、一三兩區都駐滿了所用的給養、目前都未給代價、這様一來、像我們這様窮困的沽源縣、能受得了嗎</p>

<p>在這様的悲惨的情緒裏、我總算替沽源縣記了篇呌苦連天的賬、可是親愛的讀者們、就這様的窮苦狀况下、還能抗敵勝利嗎、好了、朋友你再等着看那篇「察哈爾的戰事一篇總賬」吧、你雖然蹲在那遼遠美麗的江、我相信你對於察哈爾這一方面的戰事、總能有個清晰明瞭的影子、（八日於張垣）</p>
<h3>察哈爾戰事的一篇總賬（本報特派員國安）</h3>
<p>（一）自己聲明</p>
<p>在目前華北的情形、是普通一般人所關心的、當然在敵人這様猛烈的砲火鐵蹄下、誰敢斷定是怎様的結局呢、除了那些拿着槍桿、白日黑夜蹲伏在戰壕裏等着炸彈和砲彈光臨的朋友們、餘剩下後方的人們、那一個不是翻開報紙、（當然不看的例外、）搖着頭皺着眉的咒詛呢、在這様混沌難清的現實環境裏、我們没有拿槍桿的同志同胞們、示弱呢、還是「拿着你的槍、快快兒赴前方」呢、朋友們、我們望北望一眼吧、</p>
<p>灤東的戰雲、忽緊忽慢的游動着、可是西北角上的半個天、又被敵人的爆炸彈動搖了、我們熱鍋裏螞蟻　的同胞、在這一週裏、不是又担心着西北角上搖搖欲隨的天嗎、多倫在激戰肉搏、終於後援不繼的變換了新陣地、那麽沽源張北縣以及中俄交通綫的張家口、難道也是照様的受敵人蹂躪嗎、我是蹲在槍桿的後面、拿着筆桿的弱傢伙、那麽在這西北角上的半個大裏、對於西北角的戰綫動搖和堅固、以及對於戰略有關係的小問題、我不是應該盡量的報告給讀者嗎、所以懷着滿腔的情緒、寫成這篇個人報告書、但是這裏面的一切、都是耳所聞、目所見的眞實情形呵、那麽讀者們看見了這篇零碎不成系統的報告書、心中應當作什麽様感覺呢、</p>
<p>（二）多倫的市街戰</p>
<p>多倫在趙承綬軍長指揮的兩千騎兵下、同時也就在日人小柳津、指揮的劉桂堂逆軍、和日騎兵五百名的攻擊下、因後援不繼而放棄了、那天（二十九）狂風怒吼、而敵軍的飛機也没有光臨、然而那最壯烈而又最惨酷的市街戰、可在多倫的古城裏發生了、一個老兵喝個醉意醺醺的、他很不顧忌的這様說、</p>
<p>「我們在地方幹的、眼看支持不住了、城裏的保衛團、就集合暴民、到處縱火攻擊我們軍部的衛隊、他們大槪是因爲我們把他們的　繳了、共五六百枝槍、都送到我們的手裏、那知道這些傢伙、又弄出不少的槍來、就和我们幹上了、這一頓砲槍和大火、較前方又緊急、誰還抗的了、潮水似的就往下退、在這平闊的沙原上、當騎兵的一上馬、那裏還顧得抵抗、這時誰跑的快就算好漢子　這一投烟似的大騎兵、從多倫不同的戰線上退下來、簡直就撇開了、張多的大道、向西南角上的張北縣、跑個冒烟起、可是在大梁底附近、遠集結了一下、但是昏黑的暗夜、决不能集結完全、好在敵人進了多倫、就没有跟踪追擊、那些又要錢、又要娘們的逆軍、據說進了城這一幹、可把老百姓弄的呌苦連大、我們到張北縣的時候、恰巧原駐張北的晋軍、已經調到東面去、在張北的北面戰壕、都構築很好、這回劉桂堂逆軍再要進攻、那眞要老實不客氣的和他拚一拚、誰　管他是中國人不是中國人呢、」这老兵說的嘴裏的口沫四濺、我心裏不覺起了這様的一種感想呵、退出多倫難道是因爲都是中國人、不忍得自相殘殺嗎」（未完）</p>

<p>歐亞航空公司、爲開闢粤漢航線、曾由經理李景樅、偕代理機航主任瓦爾德·於四日離滬、赴漢試航、並視察全線、業於十一日試航成功歸來、先後抵滬、昨據李經理語中央社記者、此次試航結果、甚爲圓滿、正式開航、尙待詳擬、茲將李氏談話、分述如後、</p>
<h3>試航經過</h3>
<p>李氏談、粤漢線籌劃已久、粤地客商、對此航線、急切需要、而交通部朱部長、亦屢加催促早日開行、以利民行、故現乘西北航線暫無發展之時、亟先試航、本人於四日晨、偕代機航主任瓦爾德、乘歐亞五號機赴漢試航、由機師拉齋駕駛、過京時、因與朱部長有所洽商、故留一小時續飛、當晚抵漢、五日、由漢南飛、過長沙、因機場狹小、故未降陸、擬逕飛廣州　及至九峯山、因濃霧瀰漫、雲山難辨、不得已折回長沙、六日繼續南飛、過九峯山時、低飛於山峽之中、出峽口、越韶關未停、午後三時許、安抵廣州、訪晤軍政當局、面懇臂助、休息一日、八日、由廣飛港、擬將該線展至港埠、特訪英總督徵詢意見、當荷口頭表示歡迎、故即請政府協助接洽、九日、由香港北返、當日抵廣州、十日抵漢口、十一日過京抵滬、本人因與部方有所接洽、故留京半日、乘晚車來滬、而機航主任瓦爾德、則於當日乘原機來滬、</p>
<h3>兩點困難</h3>
<p>李氏繼語記者、　次試航、結果圓滿、惟有兩點、尙須設法、（一）航線之設備、在相當距離、必有備用機塲、以爲必要時起降之用、西北線雖無是項設備、惟以沿途多廣坦平原、遇有危險、隨處可以降落、茲粤漢線沿途阡陌縱横、均係水田、遇有阻碍　不能降落、須設備機場多處、但公司自備、所費不貲、現已與交部接洽、請予協助、（二）湖南省山勢蹯繞、雲霧迷天、而九峯山則高入雲際、飛航甚難、擬於宜章壚石兩處、設無線電台、報告氣候、以指示行止、俾免發生危險、</p>
<h3>夏末通航</h3>
<p>以上兩點、現在積極籌劃、　於一個月至三個月内、佈置就緒、則在夏末秋初、當可開航、設漢口長沙廣州三站全線航行、連中途停落時間計算在内、約六小時半、長沙廣州等處機塲、則假用軍政部所有機塲、而飛航時全用陸上機、韶關祇有水機塲、且甚狹小、故暫不設站、惟此計劃、僅係全綫中之南段計劃、尙有北段、自漢口北延、經過襄陽、直達西安、以啣接西北綫、惟尙須俟粤漢段正式通航後、始行試航及規劃一切云、</p>

<h3>國恥週演講李公樸先生談中日關係前途的我見</h3>
<p>五月九日在青年會</p>
<p>諸位朋友；今天所要講的題目是中日關係前途我見。我們知道中日的關係不是從今天纔起始的，自從光緒二十一年到現在已有很久的時期和歷史了。我們記得前天蔡子民先生所講的「日本對華政策一中曾說過，日本自併台灣佔朝鮮起，以至現在進一步製造僞國，仍是一套呑併朝鮮的老把戯，但是國民的思想在「五四運動」以前，大家曾感覺到一種亡國的恐慌，到了「五四」以後以至「九一八」的期間，大家又似乎對這種恐慌冷淡了許多，因爲這是中國國民被根深蒂固的專制制度文治思想及家庭傅統觀念所束縛的自然現象。「五四」以後的民氣雖曾起了一種改變，至九一八時民氣又爲之一振，大家就以爲帝國主義者有了殖民地也没有多大好處，在潮流的趨勢上，認爲帝國主義者只要經濟侵略，並不要土地侵略，至於無知無識的當然不會明瞭，就是有知識的也被惰氣所染，而變成醉生夢死的了。前年九一八事件發生，一般人尙認爲没有民族存亡的根本關係，無非是張學良弄壞的。而產生這些見解的原因則在一二八以前大家没有受到深切的痛苦，所以在一二八以後，熱河失守以前，人民都頽廢異常，迨後熱河失守，日軍陷山海關，攻秦皇島，逼平津，危機日增，才對於過去的所謂帝國主義不是土地侵略及中國不會亡的種種苟安謬誤的心理，得一反證。現在姑從日本情形，國際情形及中國的現狀三方面來說明一下，然後我們就可從而推測中日關係前途的情况了。</p>
<p>日本方面也可剖作三點來說；一·政治丨日本自武力成功後，繼以積極建設，卽如佔領朝鮮台灣後就用一種斷然的力量把該地治理得很好，俾償戰時的損失。在日本的立塲上講，則如最近治好東三省是與自己本身有利益，這是確切不可否認的事實。還有，日本是一個主義思想混雜的國家，尤其是狹義的國家主義思想，田中的政策，民衆的狂熱，都是擁護帝國主義的實現，而能使軍事，民衆及政治等的力量充實。二·經濟方面，我們中國的學者往往喜歡表示日本經濟恐慌的危險，但是應該知道日本的經濟恐慌不是因侵略中國而造成的。譬如美國本爲最富的國家，尙且也發生經濟恐慌，而同時英法等國都受上項的影響，所以日本的經濟恐慌也是世界性的。雖則一經戰事，彼之市塲不免要受損失，但是征服一處土地，立卽可以恢復市塲，而可補償戰事的損失。假如日本佔領東北以後，一切都可以比張學良好。鴉片公賣可免除剥削，從前鴉片烟價貴，現在價廉，至於大家吃了後的好壞，當然又一問題因其目的只在使中國資本家得到信仰，同時，原料也可以增加了，凡得到一地，卽有該地的產物。現在的東北我雖没有親眼看見過，但看到最近日人，代僞國所出的「滿洲國年鑑」的内容，就可知道日人對鑛產鐵路等事整理已能達到經濟恢復的利益，也就是一個例子。三·「國防」丨日本　國防可分對内與對外兩方面來說。在對内講來，如果在空中有所進攻，不是防不勝防嗎？如歐戰時英國倫敦受德國飛機的威脅與轟炸，已感倉皇無措，現在的空軍威力是較歐戰時，更爲進步，那麽日本國防就絕對不能處於安全，因爲誰敢說對航空有相當防止。所以，要使東京至朝鮮的海防能保持，惟有擴充土地。在對外方面講來，假使要持久戰，非要充實材料不可，但日本固然不够，即朝鮮亦是不够，故必須擴充土地，其材料始能充實。綜上二點，日本是有侵略土地必要的。</p>
<p>國際方面，各國的對華關係與日本不同，在國際方面中國是侵略中的一部份，而在日本方面中國則是關係最密切的唯一侵略對象。此此種暴力侵略欺凌弱小民族之手段，早爲過去各帝國主義的慣技，故此次國際對於日本除以武力制止外决難用公理去裁制，蓋日本可以把各國也一様侵略中國這事實爲藉口。最近從各國輿論上看來，日本各刋物上發表美國對日的咸情，並謂美國無人反對日本在滿蒙作經濟侵略的發展，且引全國青年會總幹事，威爾遜做總統時的陸軍總長，民生黨領袖培克ＮｅｗｌｏｎＢａｋｅｒ氏之言，表同情於日本之土地狹小，人口衆多，雖則有人說，日本人的話不能憑信，但是日本的地窄人多，則素爲列强所知，是我們所應當知道的事實。在太平洋會議時，日本每次總要提到人口問題，因爲這様至少可以得到世界的同情。前日倫敦路透電，有倫敦大學經濟歷史敎授Ｒ·Ｈ·Ｔａｗｎｅｙ，湯納博士，在某校演說中謂；「中國應當卽起自動，否則外侮必將取而代之，中國的紛亂已達三十年而仍未停止，實在很可悲觀的。渠在中國時，瀋陽已失，而中國人民除表示憤怒外，并無何種舉動，實在表示中國人民之忍耐性。如果國聯早能斷然處置，則日本不致敢奪滿洲全部云云，一以上可見國際對華對日之一斑。所以自中日事件發生後，中國三個公使同時辭職，卽爲顯然的一點。</p>
<p>中國方面，前日章友三先生說的，戰，和，抵抗，賴，拖等五種辦法，除了最後一種本不是辦法，但是前面幾種又是辦法嗎？試想旣不能戰，戰就不是辦法，旣不能和，和當然又不是辦法，諸如此類，那裏有個眞正的辦法呢？那最近熱河失守之後，沿長城一帶對日戰役而論，有知識的，皆對此民族戰爭，漠然不同，至於能扶助戰士而關心者，類多勤苦農民。還有，日本的外交家，松岡洋右返國，在許多民衆熱烈歡迎的時候，他很嚴重的責備他的國人，說他們國内很有一部分人不知道國家現在所處的是一個如何危險的境界。我們看到日本的外交家鼓勵民衆是這様，而我們中國有多少人肯來指責錯誤的？曁没有整個的辦法，而又没有朝野一致的表示。有人說現在民衆尙未覺悟，但是現在民衆不起來自救，如果到了將來國亡了，再要想救國，是很難的。在朝鮮的復國運動中，有一個故事，很可來做我們的殷鑒。在一九一九年開始的時候，歐戰告終，各國開和平會於巴黎，高麗人以爲時機已至，是年的正月，循例舉行全國查經會，牧師金弼沫以賣敎會報爲名，坐汽車巡行各敎會與各首領秘密聯絡，約三月二日下午二時舉行示威運動，蓋三月三日爲高麗李太王國葬日，各道各郡人民均齊集送葬，意欲乘機激起全國敵愾同仇之氣。其時高麗又有所謂天道敎者，敎主孫東熙抱光復之志，信徒逾百萬，與金弼沫合力舉義，敎會内學校與外界學校先行團結，預印傅單，廣備國旗。三月二日，各敎會首領，特開公民大會於漢城太和館，到者數萬人，升太極國旗，行懇親典禮，由各首領作沉痛的演說，當即致書駐鮮總督，長谷川好道曰，我神聖大韓國民，際昌明之世，倡自由之權而獨立，此後汝等可速返貴國，勿傷兩國國民和氣，」總督大驚，急戒嚴如臨大敵，派汽車數十輛，武裝馳至，拘捕各首領，各領袖聲色和藹，齊呼曰，我等話尙未畢，請稍待，仍從容演說，分給傅單於大衆，向國旗行禮，大呼獨立萬歲者三，遂從容就捕，凡三十三人。耶穌牧師，古善宙，崔聖模，天道敎主孫秉熙，吳世昌，梁漢默，爲其中之最著者。日人旣獲各首領，以爲無事，不意越三日，而全韓震動，家家太極國旗，人人獨立萬歲，示威運動，遍於十三道，三百六十餘縣，童子婦女，亦結隊游行，大呼還我山河，民族自决，逮捕誅戮，前仆後繼。先又派全權代表金奎軾，赴巴黎和會請願，四月十二日，以四國的認可，提出獨立請願書，國外僑民，函電四馳求援。四月十七日，組織臨時政府，閣員爲李承脫，金奎軾安昌浩李東暉崔在享文昌範李始榮李東寗等。五月十二日，美國默認李承脫爲駐美大使，允假華盛頓獨立館，爲之招待。日人見其勢日熾，極爲可危，乃調集軍警大事屠戮，裸體火炙，釘足剖腹，或三五活埋，或毀滅全閭，自三月至六月，慘死者約三萬餘，女子二千餘，監禁者萬餘人。我們想想看，在日本嚴密監視之下，費了一二十年的功夫所造成的民族奮鬥精神，能使數萬男女老幼的同胞一致的不顧生死，爲祖國爭生存，這種精神又是如何的偉大，但是一經無上暴力的壓迫，就於二三月中，殘殺殆盡，從這一點上看來，我們就知道亡國後的復與是一件如何不容易而艱難的事！</p>
<p>根據以上的分析再由個人的觀察來推測中日關係的將來不外兩途，（一）是國際共管。有人以爲國際共管將造成第二次世界大戰，但是不然，因爲國際共管並不是所有列强聚在一起，翻開中國地圖，仔細劃分，而乃是在第二次世界大戰以前列强一定要設法避免世界戰爭，在表面上仍維持和平態度，而實則比現在更進一步，利用内戰，在每一軍閥之後，有一帝國主義作其背景，以造成一似分裂非分裂，似統一不統一的國家。</p>
<p>（二）是民族奮起自救，而且要同政府合作。政府所不敢做的，就是政府的無力，也就是民衆的無力。我先來舉個例子，譬如說，「和」要在瀋陽失陷以後，錦州失守以前，但那時候有誰肯說這句話？如果那時候有這様一個有力的人出來主張而政府不依的話，恐怕政府早已被打倒了。現在亦是如此，比彷有人說這是政府的不許做，並不是人民無力量，那麽試問「土匪」難道是政府所許的嗎？要知道，如果人民知道自救而自動地起來　那不是政府所能干涉的。去年的「一二八」的時候，上海民衆的那様熱烈援助十九路軍，難道是政府所主使的嗎？所以人民應當培養和訓練自己的力量去督促政府，因爲維持治安是政府的本心，但我們却不能希望現在的政府能以强硬的態度去對付日本。我們人民如覺得是火已燃眉，應不顧一切與日本一拚，那麽各省各地的民衆就應自動的起來去督促政府抗日纔行。譬如羅斯福受命在這經濟恐慌的時期，國會中曾空前的付予總統許多特權，但是一到要解决戰債的問題，就有許多領袖出來表示反對延債的種種意見，這種意見，就使得羅斯福對於戰債問題不能不有所顧忌了。要知道中國在政治的歷史上觀察下來，已是隋性很深，外侮侵來，毫無抵抗，况且中國是農業經濟自足自給的國家，遠不足與科學的工業國家作對抗。但中國國民性本蘊藏有勇樸耐勞的特征，能耐極大的壓迫，若能嚴密的團結起來，則必能從困苦環境中打出自己的出路來。所以最後的希望就是各地民衆培植力量，訓練自己的精神，組織團體，與政府合作。如能辦到了這一步，那末，那一個政府不對，就可以打倒那一個政府。如果人民不知道自救，那一定要被淘汰。不要專責政府的不是，我們要認清楚，培養，訓練，組織，就是我們所應爲的唯一工作。（徐雉記）</p>

<h3>錦標形勢</h3>
<p>復旦臨時不參加比賽</p>
<p>牽動田徑兩錦標大局</p>
<p>中央隊因此希望驟增</p>
<p>在事先之推測、中央因人才多而平均、似居優越地位、然無殊人才、實際希望、並不甚高、光華於徑賽、大夏於田賽、確擁有强厚實力、但事有不然、復旦内部突然發生問題、祇參加游行、而不參加比賽、全部大局、將爲牽動、亦出意外今之形勢、述之如下、</p>
<p>▲光華中央爭徑賽　今者徑賽錦標、將成爲光華中央逐鹿之物、光華董叔昭已得千五百米、八百米四百米、亦有把握、陶英傑四百米、亦可佔地位、百米二百米、王季淮大有希望、中央徐鑣、恐不如之、惟中央入選人多、可得位置、中欄將屬陶英傑、高欄則柳英俊、兩校之機會與形勢皆甚平均、已得分數又各爲五分、惟倘復旦參加、則短跑之中、有復旦程金冠在、中央則更退後、光華把握更多、光華歟、中央歟、有看於今日、</p>
<p>跳高第一大夏吳錦祺（徐天章攝）</p>
<p>▲大夏中央爭田賽　田賽大砟一嗚驚人、陳寳球得鐵餅、吳錦祺得跳高又得跳遠第二、以十三分佔最優、中央得十一分、明日之標槍鐵球、又是大夏囊中物、但三級跳與撑竿跳則中央之天下、大夏只有讓之、兩方機會、亦甚平均、惟倘復旦參加、則三級跳、撑竿跳、將爲李琳奪去分數不少、大夏今者大受打擊矣、</p>
<p>▲中央穩得女錦標　今日開始競爭之女子組錦標、必歸中央、毫無疑義、兵精將足、人才濟濟、餘隊非其敵手、</p>
<p>董叔昭勝</p>
<h3>千五百米</h3>
<p>實力足功夫好</p>
<p>打破江大紀錄</p>
<p>▲胡士煊一路居先　經賽唯一之决賽千五百米、十六人列一綫起步、槍嗚後、中央胡士煊、卽捷足居先、一躍在前、領導前進、第一圈成一直線、胡在最先、光華董叔昭緊追其後、第二圈後方距離加大、胡士煊仍以極爽快之脚步在前、而董一步不鬆、釘住其後、第三人爲金陵王鳳亭、第三圈爲最後之一圈、前三名如前、而中央林宣已加緊脚步、追上列第四少在王之後、</p>
<p>▲董叔昭一衝厲害　第三圈旣過、勝負將决於最後之三百米、胡董競爭形勢、已成短兵相見、距終點一百五十餘米之遙、董叔昭開始放馬、越胡士煊而向前猛衝、一衝到底、掌聲四起、胡士煊事出意外、力有所不及、在後追隨、達終點相距二十餘米、觀董之實力、有逾於此、恐明胡强而不敢冒險、功夫可嘉、成績四分三十六秒五分二、打破江大紀錄、胡列第二、中央林宣追上列第三、金陵王鳳亭得一分、</p>
<p>田賽决賽</p>
<h3>陳寳球造鐵餅新紀錄</h3>
<p>昨日田賽决賽、共有三項、鐵餅第一陳寶球、以三五米○六造江大新紀錄、跳高第一吳錦祺、成績一米六九、退步頗多、王季淮之跳遠六米六四、尙佳、</p>
<p>▲鐵餅　第一項决賽爲鐵餅、預賽結果、陳寶球（大夏）、張捷春（中央）、鍾季卿（中央）、尹使民（中央）、徐鑣（中央）、及金陵杜樹楨六人當選、最佳成績爲陳寶球之三四米八一、决賽成績均有長進、而陳寶球賴最後之一擲、以三五米○六、破江大紀錄、但與周連增之三六米五○全國紀錄、相差尙遠、據大夏指導沈鼎南云、陳平時能擲三十七八米之遠云、餘三名俱屬中央、金陵杜樹楨以三十米十六落第五、各人成績如下、</p>
<p>第一　　陳寶球（大夏）　　三五米○六</p>
<p>（江大新紀錄）</p>
<p>第二　　張捷春（中央）　　三一米三八</p>
<p>第三　　鍾季卿（中央）　　三○米五五</p>
<p>第四　　尹俠民（中央）　　三○米二二</p>
<p>▲跳遠　第二項爲跳遠、開塲第一次賽、中央柳英俊卽得六米五二、光華名將王季淮、初試不着、第二次跳達六米六四、柳英俊曾跳至六米八十左右、但不幸被判出界、事後據一裁判員謂、此跳並未出界云、然則當爲柳君惜、否則創一全國新紀錄矣、預賽錄取之大夏吳錦祺、成績居六人中之最末、但在决賽中、第二次跳、達六米六二、一躍而列第二名、可謂幸極、得分之四人成績如下、</p>
<p>跳遠第一光華王季淮（徐天章攝）</p>

<h3>多數收音機用一條天綫</h3>
<p>— 仲琴</p>
<p>在無綫電界之中，雖然天綫是極討壓的東西，而想用各種的方法去免除天綫之裝置，但是天綫最好不要因麻煩而免去，這是無綫電界没有一個不承認的。在現在無綫電的發明家中，還没有絕對的可以避免天綫的方法發明。如果在公衆的地方，或者旅館等地方，裝設不止一隻收音機時，那裏豈不要裝置許多的天綫麽？要設法避免這一重困難，在無綫電界中已討論了許久，而没有完美的辦法。</p>
<p>最近，這個討論了極長久的問題漸漸有了一個結論，就是要避免多設天線第一個方法，是幾架收音機合用一根天線，換句話說：是一根天綫分任多數收音機的收電浪工作。這是唯一的方法，到現在已經漸漸改進，而終究是實現了。</p>
<p>一根天綫担任了多數收音機的收空中電浪工作，是不十分的精微的，這是起初試騐所得到的斷語。因爲多數的收音機，各機收各機的所需要波長的電浪，所以其中的分路很複雜，初試的時候，用二隻收音機合裝一根天線，結果並不怎様好，很不易調節，加長了天線之後，仍舊没有効力，後來在天線地線之間加了一隻電容器，容量約○·○○○二，果然成績好了。二隻收音機試騐之後三隻，三隻之後四隻，到後來，得到一個總論，是一根天線的分任許多收音機的收電浪工作，收音機的數目要有一定的限制。但這限制用什麽做一定的標準，還研究不出。起初，五隻收音機合用一條二十呎長的天線是唯一的限度，如果用六隻收音機時，連一些聲音都不能收到。還有一點，波長的限度與收音機的數量也有關係的，最初的試騐，五隻六管收音機合用一根天線祇可以收二百至六百公尺以内的電波。這個原因，現在也没有明瞭。</p>
<p>後來漸漸改良研究，英國有一個無線電家拿收音機增多至五十隻，而合用一條天線，結果非常好，因爲他除去了天線時聲音輕一倍，裝上時響一倍，而且範圍也增加，所以才證明他是眞的成功了。他的裝法也是在天地線之間加一電容器，但是天線比較高一些。現在飛利浦公司已請這位無線電家做工程師，現在仍舊在改造，將來也許更有驚人的發展哩！</p>
<h3>中分電阻的接法</h3>
<p>— 慶</p>
<p>中分電阻器，應當直接在燈塵上。（如圖Ａ）如果接在情源變壓器的出線上，（如圖Ｂ）祇要ＡＢ兩根花綫，略有長短，兩端電壓即失平衡，因此很容易引起交流音。又使用電源變壓器的中分線而不用中分電阻時，也有同様的弊病發生。還有交流收音機的燈絲調節器，應當接在中分電阻的前面，（如圖Ｃ）。附各種眞空管應用的中分電阻表如後：</p>
<h3>報務須知（一）（）</h3>
<p>— 體乾</p>
<p>無線電通報應有之手續</p>
<p>（一）凡經電政管理局規定之通報時間，均應按時遵守，不得延誤。</p>
<p>（二）在規定甲台與乙台通報之時，彼此即應呼呌。如爲單互電台，須一方呼呌，一方諦聽。如乙台聽得甲台之信號後，須俟其呼呌完畢，再行答覆甲台，請其開始拍發。如係雙互電台，同時收發，則於呼呌時，同時諦聽，可免延誤。</p>
<p>（三）如有甲台呼呌乙台，而久不聞彼方之呼應，以致延誤通報時間，當即登錄日記簿，並通知報務主任，以究原由。</p>
<p>（四）凡遇雙方收音困難之時，須更改波長，而應即先用簡語通和對方，以免誤會。</p>
<p>（五）如甲乙兩台，在通報時期内，雙方並無電報拍發，亦應彼此守聽，如遇甲台與丙台積滯電報頗多，則可由甲台知照乙台暫時守候，且與丙台通報若干時。</p>
<p>（六）電報開始拍發之後，遇有通報時間將終之時，應視其電報之緊要長短，而定中止或繼續收發。</p>
<p>（七）如甲乙兩台通報將終之時，而甲台尙有加急電報數份，須立時發出要求乙台守聽者，乙台應再守聽十分鐘，如再須延長時，應由乙台呼問其時在規定通報期内之丙台可否通融後，再行定奪。</p>
<p>（八）通報時間，有不合報務情形處，應由報務主任據情呈報，由管理局修改之。</p>
<h3>不費分文的電碼練習器</h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>玩弄無線電的同志們，最恨的是交流音，但是，這裏却利用交流音做一個電碼練習器。</p>
<p>如圖，花線一根，繞在電燈的花線上，（約二三十匝）另外一頭，串聯聽筒與電鑰後，再接地線。此時啓閉電鑰，聽筒中便得悅耳之電訊。</p>
<h3>小經騐</h3>
<p>— 徐秉</p>
<p>度盤及膠木板上之白線日久污損，可用白鉛末少許與亞麻仁油（ＬｉｎｓｅｅｄＯｉｌ）調成厚槳，擦於線上·乾後·則潔白如新矣·</p>
<p>以沙皮去銅絲包皮，較用刀爲清凈，且少切斷之危險。</p>
<p>如欲知所用銅絲之粗細，而苦無量線計者，可用下法以瀾之：法將欲潤之銅絲，在鉛筆繞足一寸知其每寸之圈數後，即可在銅絲表（Ｗｉｒｅ　Ｔａｂｌｅ電學及無線電參考書均有載之）中查得其號數及大小。例如有漆包線，每寸爲十七圈，即可在表中知其爲十五號，直徑爲·。５８９英寸。</p>
<h3>收音機障碍之檢查與處理（四）</h3>
<p>— ＡＡ</p>
<p>（四）發生雜音者</p>
<p>雜音的發生，有二··一是發生於收音機本身者，一是發生於外來干擾者·除去了天地而仍然發生雜音者，那是收音機本身的毛病，否則便是外來的干擾了。</p>
<p>現在單講檢查收音機本身所發的雜音。</p>
<p>雜音是一種最討壓的聲音，牠能夠擾亂優美的節目，使人摕興。諸位的收音機有發生雜音的，不妨依了上表去檢查試試。</p>

<h3>救火</h3>
<p>— 百合</p>
<p>隨手把香烟屁股一丢，恰巧丢在棉絮堆裏，星星之火，可以燎原，登時會冒穿屋頂，烈燄騰空。所以在下一聽到人聲鼎沸，警笛亂嗚，便會嚇得牙齒捉對兒厮打，生怕鄰家失火，殃及我居，不得不披髮攖冠而往救。若火還離我家有一箭之遙，那我可不用着急，儘擠在人堆裏，伸頭縮頸的瞧。這並不是在下喜歡出自己的醜，實在的天下滔滔，孰不如此。</p>
<p>我們的瀋陽，着了一點星星之火，一夜工夫，燒了遼吉二省。火勢太猛烈了，北面的黑龍江，南面的錦州，也立即變成一堆瓦礫。接着，又燒到了山海關，熱河全境。火勢是猛烈異常，袖手旁觀的左鄰右舍，没一個不贊驚奇，譽爲觀止。後來，北滿的火勢，逐漸地有燬滅中東路，延入俄境的情形，於是俄國便準備消防器，阻止火路。山海關的火，沿着北寗路，逐漸追近開灤礦，於是英國也立即把火路打斷。熊熊之火，此路不通，乃隨着風勢，延燒到察哈爾那一角裏去了。</p>
<p>當瀋陽初失火時，中國就嗚鑼求救於日内瓦消防隊。不料那些消防員，你推我我推你，誰也不肯動手。後來勉强地動手了，無奈勢已燎原，澆水宛如澆油，不可收拾。但是這火委實太厲害了，灸得隔太平洋觀火者，也有些站不住，於是華盛頓消防隊，預備帮着日内瓦消防隊，一同救火。雖然能否一鼓作氣，將火撲滅，尙無把握，但是我想消防隊儘不濟，比了用提桶汲水救，總有力些，總可把火勢壓下一些去，而漸歸熄滅。</p>
<p>大家籠着手兒瞧消防隊救火罷。</p>
<h3>紅顏</h3>
<p>— 才斂</p>
<p>稱女子之美色相者曰「紅顏」，此語見於漢武帝賦：「包紅顏而弗明」，相沿至今，猶有其說。</p>
<p>凡可夠得上稱爲「紅顏」的女子是很少有的，即在歷史上載入簡册的，亦屬寥寥可數丨可是一個人誰不欲自己的相貌勝過他人？誰不欲享受紅顏的美名？唯其是那般可貴，所以人人皆欲爲「紅顏」之念，亦愈迫切。</p>
<p>今之一般摩登小姐和摩登奶奶們把「紅顏」兩字的意義誤解了。伊們以爲顏字之爲義，在詩經：「顏如渥丹」，作額角解，在禮記：「齊顏色」作眉目之間解，照字面，「紅顏」即紅的面頰之謂，以爲面頰紅的人，就可算是紅顏了。少女們爲了羞澀或驚懼的時候，偶然於面頰上泛浮着兩朶紅雲。蘇軾詩「紅潮登頰醉檳榔」這種出於自然的風度，固可令詩人歌詠不置。無奈爲時甚暫，於羞澀或驚懼過後，兩朶紅雲亦隨之而消散了。所以摩登女性們爲欲保持紅顏長留在面上之故，勢不得不用人工的方法了，人工的方法者何？就是把面頰搽得紅紅便得了。</p>
<p>伊們不計伊們的芳齡幾多高？伊們的尊容好不好？即貌醜似夜叉，年老如徐娘，也學着他人緊緊地捧着一面鏡子，擦了高價的巴黎粉之後，接着拚命地塗上一層猩紅的胭脂，老實不客氣的以「紅顏」自居了。</p>
<p>摩登女性們旣倡導於都市，自然會有鄕下大姑娘效顰於農村，這様不出數年，定是凡女子皆「紅顏」了。猗歟盛哉！</p>
<p>常言道：「紅顏自古多薄命」。摩登女性們旣儼然以「紅顏」自居，難道不怕薄命之可慮嗎？</p>
<h3>公墓</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>吞没人生的黑體怪物，固然見了它有些駭怕，就是纍纍荒塜，一坏黄土，也何嘗不使人激動恐懼丨過去的封侯降相私家經營的墓地，自然是富麗矞皇了；而於經濟土地的打算，却絲毫没有顧及，牌坊的旌表，石人石馬的竪立，動輒耗資巨萬；目前要人們也有生壙的建築，可是這些皆非中等之家，所能幻想得到的了；最近我參與一位故友的安葬儀式，得巡禮了一回公墓，又因爲這次治喪我爲其間的一員，上午便去部署一座簡陋的禮堂，公務葴事，仔細端詳觀覽了一遍。</p>
<p>進門一座殯舍，殯舍隔壁是小小的禮堂，每距丈餘的墓地，有條水門汀砌成的甬道，清潔平坦，眞是光可鑒人；墓穴四間，有青青的碧草，席地成茵，有紅的花兒，有綠的樹兒；我們在春花秋月的時節，想像它的景色，却要敎人留戀忘返咧；每一個碑，每一座塔，都各運匠心，有不同的精巧，華麗的塔頂，更立上一位小天使，或是彌勒般的人間上帝；每一個碑和塔前面，都砌着花瓶，放着石凳；拿許多遺影分析起來，裏面有嚴父，慈母，有愛子，嬌女，有青春美婦，有英俊少年；那天見到一位四十外歲的婦人，挈了伊的兒媳，爲伊的故夫掃墓，手持一束鮮花，敎伊媳婦獻給伊的丈夫，又敎伊兒子爲墓塔攝影，三人並立着行過禮，默默的憑弔了一回，纔懶洋洋的走出了公墓，還一面說，右首隙地，是我長眠之所，你們謹記着。吞没故友人生的那個東西，是易了裝的一個黄色怪物，由輤車下來，是幾位童子軍舁入墓門的，儀式很簡單，牧師禱告過，齊唱了兩首哀歌，便宣告禮成；我們知道受過洗禮的敎友，隨處都表現潔淨和沈默的意態，所以一座偌大的公墓，一草一葉，好像都纖塵不染，門外有清溪曲澗的詩意，有雞犬相聞的人事；在鐵栅上懸着一方小小「浸會公墓」的牌子，好像也夾着沈黑的成分；這種境地，只可說它是人間的墓道，鬼國的樂園了。</p>
<h3>幽默語</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>枉空救國！政府和人民，喊着「航空救國」的口號，已經好久了。「未生兒子先題名，」□□號□□號的飛機！倘然把那些號名編列起來，也大有可觀了。但是據報告徵募航空基金的成績看來，與預定的數目，相去尙遠。尤其是富人捐助的很少，這未免要令人失望。至於前敵各處，敵機施暴，軍民遭禍之慘，眞非筆墨所能形容。我國固有之航空隊，旣須供勦匪之用，未便參加作戰。（據報載航空隊炸朱毛，頗有效果。）而未來之航空隊，又未知何日可以成立。這様的「航空救國，」恐怕要變成「枉空救國」咧！</p>
<p>國難當心！現在是「國難當頭」的當兒！但那都市中的人們，仍是嬉戱自若。各處娱樂塲中，依舊滿坑滿谷。好像國難雖亟，於我何干。黄帝華胃的民族性，如是其糟，眞欲效賈生之痛哭。不過依在下想來，一般人的心理，因爲國難當頭，分明是；國難尙在起頭的時候。時機未熟，還没有達到中心點。萬一到了「國難當心，」或者「國難臨脚，」那纔是緊急的關頭呢！</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第六回　甜苦情場冷觀評兩面　崎嶇世路密約訂三年</p>
<p>積之連連點着頭答應好。桂枝道：怎麽新年你們也不放假呢？積之道：我們是過陽曆年的，你不知道嗎？桂枝道：可是這話又說回來了，海甸這地方又没有什麽消遣的地方，還不如在衙門裏辦辦公事，可以消磨時問呢。積之笑道：總是休息的好，這様大風，跑來跑去，也冷得難受呀。這種話，都，</p>
<p>說得無聊，二人面對面的站着，没個作道理處。桂枝没有說要走，積之不便丢了他，獨自回家去。就向他笑道：咖啡店不休息的，我們再去喝一杯咖啡，好嗎？這正中了桂枝的下懷，這可見知己之言，究竟一猜便着，便笑道：咖啡我又不會喝的，怎麽你老請我喝咖啡。積之道：你不願喝咖啡，那就過一天···桂枝不等他說完，便道：大新年的，你請着我，我也不便駁回你的話，我就陪你去坐坐罷。說着話，他倒移了脚先走。積之看他這個様子，看不出他是什麽意味，也就只好將由着他一路到咖啡館來。這咖啡館裏，原只有兩個雅座，裏面一個雅座，已經人佔有了，二人便坐在外面這個雅座裏。積之坐下來笑道：我看還是老規矩，給你要一碗藕粉吧？他如此說着，却聽到隔壁的雅座裏，有人咦了一聲。仔細聽着，那邊聲音又復寂然。當然，自己說一句要一碗藕粉，這個無可驚異之處，隔壁人家那一聲咦着，也許不是說自己的，這也就不必去理會了。伙計送着咖啡藕粉來，二人隔桌子相對坐着，慢慢的吃喝。桂枝不說話，積之也就没有說什麽話。屋子裏寂然了許多，還是積之先開口道：過年過得好嗎？桂枝道：什麽好？年三十夜，差不多讓債主子逼死了。他說到了窮，積之是無可安慰的，只得淡淡的說了一句道：這在那一界都是様的。只說完了這句，彼此又默然了（六八）</p>
<p>小園藝</p>
<h3>夏初的花卉</h3>
<p>— 朱戳</p>
<p>「開到蘼蕪花事了。」是的，在這蔷薇吐出嬌艷的花朶的當兒，大地上一切花木，都已綠肥紅瘦。梅，那鈕子似的果兒，早已結滿了離離枝頭；櫻桃紅了，芭蕪綠了，水也似的流光，早把爛曼的春，暗暗送去，換了上少婦美的夏來。在這春夏交替的當兒，却正有許多花兒，値得人們留戀，好似十七妙年華的女郎。</p>
<p>蕙蘭那雅淡的幽香，馥馥地送入鼻觀，確不是那四七一一，都士佳香水等濃香膩芬，所能比！並「國香的稱謂，蘭眞當之無愧。在這春光闌珊時，江南人家，都馥馥地把蕙蘭供着；人還没有踏進室中，那甜甜的香味，早已撲入襟懷了。在春季開放的蘭花，有蕙蘭和草蘭兩種。草蘭，大都是紹興人擔着在市上出售的。蕙蘭的葉子，比較細而少，花的種類，也比較爲多，那種素心，梅瓣，荷瓣，黑心等蕙蘭，都很名貴，價値自也很大。並且因着蘭，是種在盆裏的花卉，種植時很不容易，那盆，泥，水，苔，都有精緻的研究，稍一不愼，就要萎悴而死。</p>
<p>牡丹牡丹確可當得國色的評判；那碗來大的花朶嫣紅，姹紫，各色俱備。色相是這們艷麗，華貴，在花國中確可占領羣芳。牡丹以顏色黑的，最名貴，綠的次些，紅的最普通。蘇州閶門外白蓮橋浜的培德堂殯舍，以前「五色牡丹」，很是出名，所以常有不少携榼帶酒的游客，前去賞玩，可是現在滄桑幾變，不知那裏的牡丹，有没有當年的盛况。牡丹的花期短少，盛開之後，須立卽採下，否則明年就不會再開了，所以蘇州有句諺語：「穀雨三朝打牡丹，」這大約正合那句「好花不長」罷。</p>
<p>紫藤那一球球燦爛的花朶，纓絡般垂在嫩綠的柔條中間，眞比紫葡萄還晶瑩燦爛，値得使人留連。在這春事將了的時候，紫藤確是可愛的花。蘇州奉直會館（拙政園）的天井裏，有一株明代名人，文衡山手植的古代紫藤，藤幹虬拏，柔條紛披，在這著花的當兒，更嬌滴滴地，表示它是先賢的手澤。</p>
<p>繡球雪様白，球様圓；繡球花，確也爲初夏的園林，裝點出不少富麗風光。繡球的花朶，，雖這們大，但仔細看看，却是許多小花，簇聚而成。這眞可呌做是有合羣性的花朶了。</p>
<p>代代花與珠蘭花代代花與珠蘭花，雖然它的顏色，不足以動人，但那幽馥的香氣，却甜凈可愛，足以使人迷戀。這兩種花，不但可植在盆中，做室中的清供。並且把花焙乾了，可放在茶葉裏，添茶味的清香。在煮茗清談的當兒，那馥馥的香氣，從盃中透出，慢慢地喝着，正不必盧仝七碗，才會風生兩腋，栩栩欲仙哩！</p>
<p>玟瑰花色香味，皆上上，那有剌的玟瑰確可名實相符。那嬌紅的艷色，郁馥的香氣，並且那花瓣兒，不但可浸酒；搗爛之後，和着白糖可以做玟瑰糖和玟瑰醬。玟瑰糖固然甜香可口，那嬌艷紅潤的玟瑰醬，塗上那白白的棕子，更使饕餮家見了食指大動。爲端陽佳節，添上一層韻事。</p>
<p>初夏的花，除了上述幾種，還有木香花，香水花，蔷薇花，等等花兒，隨着如水流光，由粒粒花萼，一刹時開得爛漫如錦。可是幾陣風雨，早又落英滿徑，殘紅遍地。花開花謝，不過都是一刹那間。然而人生却早隨這一雲流光，由少而壯，由壯而老了。看着這易謝的花兒，正覺「時乎時乎不再來，」尤其在這國難時期，怎好等閒過去！</p>

<h3>絲茶蘇浙蠶訉近聞</h3>
<p>（常州）各市鄕農民今歲無力育蠶者比比皆是、而桑樹因天寒發芽較遲、蠶汛亦晚、蠶户因無資購種、咸向鄕區公所等借貸蠶本、購育改良種、收蟻後天氣晴暖、蠶蟻發育頗佳、惟蠶汛因經濟關係、早晚懸殊、西南鄕最早之蠶已入大眼、東鄕大帮三眠開葉、北鄕最晚三蠶甫三眠起眠、</p>
<p>（餘杭）瓶窰長樂橋等處農民、今歲早帮孵育之土種、幾至全部傾棄、補育之改良種蠶汛雖晚、而天氣晴暖、發育順利、且有指導員協助進行、蠶蟻經過均甚良好、惟蠶汛遲早不一、早蠶有一部份出火、卽可上簇作繭、次者亦已大眠起眠、晚帮尙祇三眠開葉、</p>
<h3>絲繭商請免稅救濟</h3>
<p>電請免征各項捐稅藉輕負担</p>
<p>本埠絲繭商近以洋莊絲銷一蹶不振、絲價慘跌、Ｂ級白廠經價已跌進五百兩、以此絲價扯合繭本每百斤鮮繭祇可値洋二十餘元、江浙兩屬新繭瞬將上市、若不請求政府免稅救濟、則農商經濟勢必同處破產、故特由絲繭總公所絲廠同業公會等分電江浙兩省政府、蠶兩財政廳請求免徵繭行營業稅行帖稅騐灶費敎育費以及地方公益捐等、藉輕負担、而維農商云、</p>
<h3>珍眉綠茶法銷續輰</h3>
<p>昨日本埠洋莊茶市、遂安土莊温州等路綠茶、法莊去路尙不寂寞、全市共由怡和·協和·錦隆·天裕等行買進六百二十九箱、珍眉售價自一百元至一百五十元、針眉售價自四十三元至六十二元、較前日均無變動、惟各洋行因辯進新貨業已報裝出口、預料將來採購、認價頗有縮緊之趨勢云、</p>
<h3>糧食河下米步跌一二角</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源五六十號、去胃零躉兩胃仍以人心不堅、未能輰開、雖形勢稍佳、但因來源夥湧、市况尤見呆滯、致蘇同粳及南港米價續跌一二角、包胃均爲南洋興化帮採取青角松江楓西練等薄稻千餘包、但吃盤仍苛、非削價不納、故薄稻市面高者跌角許、中關削修二角左右、此種清淡景象、誠所不料、觀察形勢、尙無轉機之望、杜洋尖續軟數分、陰元亦落角許、變元因乏貨尙能站定、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源三十來號、市上去路白粳懈淡、市形又小一二角、薄稻高料小近角、早稻來貨見旺、去路滯細、價亦小一二角、羊尖到貨續有、去化尙可開高定、中次疲角許、杜尖小一角、客尖疲勢、陰變元稍帶疲云、</p>
<p>▲更正昨報市斛放大六合八一節、今據市豆米行業同業公會來函稱該公會較斛、向以檢定所檢定之砠斛爲標準、並請社會局檢定所派員監視、並無絲毫放大與收縮之可能云、合亟更正</p>
<h3>北洋帮辦裝敏黨米</h3>
<p>昨日洋米又見活動、本街辦進高小絞二百包、價七元五角七分、客帮亦有辦意、但尙在議價之中、北洋帮辦胃亦活動、與安利洋行成議敏黨米一千包、價開七元七角半、敏黨久無交易、售價前曾喊至八元、此票貨品較陳、故售價未能扳足、又福嘉洋行到市兜售新交易、計卽裝高小絞七萬包、討價每百斤四元九角七分、進户索價四元九角三分、祇有四分之出入、或能妥議也、</p>
<p>客秈有囤户求脫、囤客有裝到、去胃雖有福州之活潑、然以囤户之急求脫手、故行情反小數分、計售開江西機晚二百包、價八元二角至一角半、蕪湖機元一百九十包、價九元九角、次至四角二分、湖南機元一百七十包、價九元半、又機油二百包、價八元七角、又齊油一百七十七包、價七元半、又機紅米三百廿包、價八元一二角、又砶靖三百八十包、價七元一角八分至一角、又齊靖七百包、價六元七角一分至六元半、統爲福州帮辦去云</p>
<h3>實銷不起</h3>
<p>粉市漲後又疲</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈堅定之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲九角零、坎拿大漲七角零、故開價時、各月份曾較前月漲起一分左右、惟自二盤後、各月份市氣又復漸疲、以業内外購買、在此全國不景氣之中、實覺均無興胃、故國外形勢雖步入佳境、而本埠實銷、則終無起色、此種情形、恐非一時所能恢復也、迨至下午開盤、各月份市面又見步疲、交易又寂寞無神、以買户之不輰、各月份遂又自然趨疲、所以上午雖好、下午反較跌落也、結果本月份較前日小五厘、七月份小二厘半、九月份好二厘半、餘無比較云、</p>
<h3>麩皮祇開二元零五分</h3>
<p>麩皮市面、自内地帮銷塲稅减後、開價曾一再鬆動、大有難以挽救之勢、昨日開價、祇二元零五分、合之從前之銀數、祇一兩四錢半左右、與前年之最高價、幾跌二分之一之巨、可知各種物價之下墜、實與時局有重大關係云、</p>
<h3>新蠶豆即日可抵</h3>
<p>頭批有三四百包</p>
<p>今庚氣候寒冷、對於小熟出新勢必見遲、幸刻下已晴正、新蠶豆不日可見登塲、其首帮溫州貨在三四日内有三四百包可到、聞該地收獲尙可樂觀、貨品惟因搶新關係、身份稍軟、抵申頭批售價約在五元左右、但今庚去路不知趨勢若何耳、</p>
<h3>糖市粗砂白市勢轉平</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以漲價後、銷路仍未輰旺、故趨勢平平而已、公會劃盤二四粗砂白呌二十元二角原盤、二十號中砂白十九元六角、八九號荷赤十六元一角、均乏成交、蓋市象復有轉疲之傾向也、廠盤有昌興行售出、光華糖廠祿字二十元零四角半、壽字十九元九角半、磨砂加廣包二十元零六角、號盤有廣潮帮開出片青一百餘蔞、價爲八元二角、又廣冰一百袋、價爲二十二元、跌去八角、聞後批已有續到、故市勢疲軟、海南又開百數十包、價爲十三元二角半、比前略小、潮青開出二三百包、價爲十一元八角至六角、次之十一元二角、新到之正綿赤較高者開十五元一角至十五元、次之十四元八九角、</p>
<h3>南北貨糯米枝價難過廉</h3>
<p>荔枝千近又銷路轉呆、如金山元枝·扁枝以海口枝·水東枝·繭竹柱等均有回跌、惟糯米枝因貨底不多、兼之號存告罄、故市價未肯過廉、昨行盤較高者售一百四十五元、次一百三十五元、</p>
<h3>五金青鉛回漲一角半</h3>
<p>青鉛市面、受實交寥少、及美匯放長關係、致標準步下、最廉價每擔開至十五元三角半、而遠　抛貨則開至十五元、昨紐約來電、其定價每噸要四十七金元　、比前猛漲二金元半、但申市終以實交不起、致標準祇好起一角半、刻每擔開十五元五角、而出路除零碎生意外、大宗買賣依然無聞、聞目下到貨方面、其成本每噸仍爲三十六元七角半及三十七元（美金）左右、是以市價一節、殊少鉅大之希望也、</p>
<h3>油市洪桐油發展乏力</h3>
<p>洪江桐油本在當銷之際、惟近年來農村經濟破產、鄕間實銷、年不如年、每年所產、不能銷罄、供過於求實爲最近三四年來之根本大病、蓋洪桐油係白桐油所改造而成、專供國内髹漆之用、並無别項用途、又乏國外去路、銷塲與用途、均有限制、照現在之實銷、苟非產額减少、則年有過剩、根本實無辦法、卽以現銷而論、値此夏令本在當旺、而乃市塲之沉寂、幾與落令相同縱價格步鬆、亦不能引動購者之興味、斯無他、實係農民受經濟限制、無力從事於裝璜點綴也、副牌如楊恒源慶元豐等祇售每桶二十一元稍零、市情依然無發展可能、</p>

<h3>瘋狂了的世界</h3>
<p>— 靜子</p>
<p>在昨天的報紙上讀了××律師代囚人呈請司法部澈查×××監獄積弊的一篇呈文，引起我滿腹無名的悲哀，同時想起了兩年前一位瘦死獄中的朋友，丨一個被黑暗吞没了的青年。也正是在×××監獄丨那黑暗的天地，那恐怖的魔窟。據我所知，我那位朋友是一個刻苦的學生，一個有爲的青年，只爲了發起組織一個研究學術的社團，便被捕房拘捕，引渡到某軍事機關，於是便被判决了三年以上的徒刑。他被解送到×××監獄時，已經是身患重病；然而獄中「仁慈的」醫生却斷定他的病是假裝的。同囚的犯人代請監獄當局將他手上和脚上的銬鐐暫時解脫，也終不得允許。他在病魔與鐐銬之下輾轉掙扎，整天只是閉着眼睛喘出低微而凄厲的呻吟，有時甚至連呻吟也被怒叱與鞭笞鎭壓下去，只能靜靜地等死，不能做出一點點聲音。病到最後，顯然是無救了，他便被搬到另一間暗室，邀「天恩」，這時才得准許銬鐐暫時從他的腐爛的手上和脚上解脫。但隨着銬鐐的解脫，這一位青年，這一個囚徒，最後睜開眼發出一聲慘笑，也便大解脫了。丨便在黑暗的魔窟中犧牲了。</p>
<p>這位朋友的慘死，本來是無足數說，在黑暗與恐怖籠罩之下，青年犧牲者眞多得如恒河沙。而這現象也不只是中國所獨有，日本，德意志，意大利，以至整個世界，無不是這様。最近日本某作家之被警署活活打死，便是眼前的一個實例。</p>
<p>整個世界是瘋狂了，歷史已回復到中世紀時代。</p>
<p>戰爭，屠殺，恐怖，幽禁，破壞，魔鬼的舞蹈，奴隸的呻吟，整個世界是瘋狂了丨</p>
<p>「殺」代替了「自由」，「逮捕」與「幽囚」禁錮了「意志」，這是干涉主義的黄金時代。</p>
<p>電刑，老虎凳，辣椒水灌鼻，攀反罟，吊打，毆辱，不分獄内與獄外，有人在求死不得，有人在獰笑。這世界便是這様，丨文明破產了，野蠻復活了，白茫茫的霧瀰漫了整個世界。</p>
<p>這世界，這世紀，文明的苦難，人類的浩刧，歷史的倒車丨</p>
<p>×××監獄算是什麽？這世界也就是一個黑暗的惨毒的大囚籠，呼寃嗎？我們到何處去呼寃？</p>
<h3>醫生（續）</h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>他臥在那陰鬰的病室裏，忽過清晨，忍過黄昏，忍過那些年青的門徒的不關心的面孔，希望從病魔手裏脫逃出來，可是上帝毫不憐恤他，病是一天一天加重了。最後，肺病不但不减，同時又加上新的症候，他的睪丸腫了。這事驚動了那個醫學者，他親身來看病了。他說，這現象是因爲肺菌被藥驅逐到睪丸裏，所以非要割下一個睪丸不可，而且一割下來，他的肺病也就可以漸漸地好起來。謝謝天，如果他的說話是眞實的。當時，我把這事講給另外的一個友人聽了，那個友人是好講笑話的，他說：「這醫生恐怕不大高明吧，據他說肺菌可以驅逐，爲什麽他們不把肺菌一直驅逐到脚底，跌在地上，而反把它趕到那要緊的地方去呢」？</p>
<p>同時，那個醫學家還另外介紹一個有名的外科手術的醫生，我的老友便從一個醫院抬進另一個醫院裏，不到三十分鐘，手術施行過了，休養了一個星期，再遷回到他的老病院。但是他的病仍不見有起色，而目不久，那只剩下的一個睪丸，仍然腫大了，於是那個醫學家也就不得不再親身來看一次，他診斷的結果，說上次的睪丸没有割乾凈，剩下了一塊又和另一個好的睪丸凝結起來，所以那其餘的一個也非要割了不可。但那個病人的身體支持不住了，這一點醫生自然比我們更清楚的，割了恐怕死得更快一些，不割倒還可以多延遲幾天，而得到一個寗靜的死，於是我的友人和我都主張不再割治了。</p>
<p>果然，没有幾天，在一個深夜裏，我的友人喘了他的最後的氣息！丨讓我們祝福這位長久和病掙扎的靈魂安息吧！</p>
<p>×　　　　×　　　　×</p>
<p>我的生命尙没有活得很久，看不了許多更懧惡的醫生的面像，可是我聽見了更多的殘忍的事。讀者們有没有耐心聽我述說出一兩段呢？</p>
<p>在東京，有一個日本婦人到帝國大學醫院去看眼病，許多的助手都診斷不出她的病名，請來了眼科主任，那也是一位極有聲譽的老博士。他上下翻開那個婦人的眼皮看，便明白了，驕傲而且滿意。他的身邊圍着一大羣的實習的學生，嚴肅地站立着聽他們先生的高見。那個老博士翻着婦人的眼，把病原講给學生聽，指示出那現在眼裏的病的現象，但是他忘了那個害病的婦人在這種情况下所忍受的痛苦了。</p>
<p>老博士得意地講完了，給那婦人以無上的光榮，親手點藥水。可是那個婦人的眼睛受了這許久的折磨，再也不聽自己的支配了，藥水方要點下去，眼睛便酸痛地閃瞬着，老博士費了幾次的努力，都没有成功。他發起脾氣了，照着那婦人的頰上啪啪地打了兩下，把東西一丢，氣憤地走開了。可憐那個婦人眼睛眩暈着，好像昏過去，周圍站立着的學生們，愕然地看着走開的老博士和眼睛旋轉的病婦人，可是没有一個人敢來繼續着這手術。</p>
<p>婦人的意識再清楚過來，那些年青的學生們吩咐她去央求他們的先生；終歸婦人的笑臉與跪求使老博士軟了心，才再回来點了藥，「這事是不稀奇的，」那講述這故事給我聽的日本學生說，「因爲科學家是社會上最高貴的人！」</p>
<p>我看過日本權威醫生的威福，所以我相信這說話。</p>
<p>重重地在一個婦人的頰上掌了兩下，雖然也是一種奇辱，但究竟與奪掉一個婦人的性命的事相差很遠了。我再講一個不幸的婦人死在殘酷的醫生的手裏的事。</p>
<p>事情是發生在北平，當時許多人都曾曉得的，我也同様不願宣佈那醫院的名字。</p>
<p>在北平的某醫院裏，有一個婦人害了腹部的病，須施行開腹的手術，一個有名的醫生擔任了這工作。這個醫生一向是生意興隆的，那一次正當給這個不幸的婦人施行着手術的時候，突然有某要人來電話招這醫生了。醫生一心地只想着給一個要人看一次病所能得到的利益，就忘掉那手下的婦人，胡亂地吩咐助手們縫起肚皮，他乘着汽車飛到要人的家裏去。</p>
<p>醫生再回來的時候，那個婦人已經斷了氣。婦人的家族不答應，要求醫生重新剖腹來看，腹部再打開了，在腸胃間，發見到一把剪刀，因爲當時不留心，被遺在裏面！</p>
<p>這個醫生，是有着確確實實的證據，犯了殺人罪了，然而人間的法律並没有制裁他，我不曉得這是爲了什麽緣故。</p>
<p>所以我咀咒這醫生以及一切與這相彷彿的醫生們！</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（二十六）今年何年乎？</p>
<p>今年何年乎？此一愚問，聰明之國人，宜若不難置答。試詢之政治家，政治家必日憲政年，諸葛孔明立法，阿斗奉行可也。試詢之軍事家，軍事家必日動匪年，抗日不妨長期，千年萬年可也。此外，詢之工業家或商業家，當日國貨年，已見動人之廣告矣。詢之經濟家或農業　，當日農村復興年，巴有特設之機關矣。詢之思想家。　　　遍批判年，胡　人已成箭　。詢之著作家，書日作家自傳年，自叙傷　繼叢　。詢　　　　，當日幽默年，幽默文章不經而走。予之爲人。不名一家，旣已執筆爲文，聊自附驥幽默。尙何言哉？又何謙哉？惟幽默出自英語，頗有洋貨之嫌。民族意識有靈，行文宜避洋典。數典而不忘祖，愛國斯爲到家。故予尙論幽默文人，自孔丘莊周始。蓋孔子莊周生當春秋戰國之際，諸侯無道，忌諱彌多，啟口命筆，皆宜以幽默出之。鄭人詈孔子爲喪家之狗，孔子亦欣然承之。或呼莊子爲牛爲馬，莊子亦且應之爲牛爲馬。聖智如孔莊，非以犬馬自甘也；特以亂世之人，或犬馬之不若，呼爲犬馬，斯亦犬馬已耳，何足較乎！此孔莊之幽默也。不過孔聖人志在干祿，栖栖以求。自命聖人之徒，往往曲學阿世，助桀爲虐，率獸食人，才足以盜名，智足以飾惡。李斯馮道，何代蔑有？今之有志少年，輒</p>
<p>詈名流學者曰，此某人之走狗也！此某黨之走狗也！此某階級之走狗也！第未知諸公聞之，有無孔聖人之雅量，而曰然哉然哉，欣然自承耳。此孔子之幽默所以爲不可及歎？今有文人奉孔子　　爲幽默之棠，長有以也。　子則不然，甘曳尾之辱，却爲　之聘，視聖人爲大盜，齊富貴於塵埃，不譴是非，不尊仁義。董曁無道之廷，則見口堯而心桀；出無道之野，則遇貌夷而心跖，則又奚取夫空名之仁義，與無定之是非哉？其爲文也，以天下爲沈濁，不可與莊語；譯爲今言，意謂亂世不可以說老實話。於是以巵言爲曼衍，以重言爲眞，以寓言爲廣。何謂巵言？長篇大論，瞎吹牛皮，天花亂墜，莫明其妙，所謂要人發表之談話宣言似之。何謂重言？昔之文人，引經據典，詩云子曰。今之論者，不引孫中山云，馬克期云，則引蒲列汗諾夫曰，盧那卡爾斯基曰，是也。何谓寓言？指桑駡槐；恨和尙，打秃驢：今之詩人小說家優爲之。莊子以此三者爲文，正莊子自謂以謬悠之說，荒唐之言，無端崖之辭，時恣縱而不儻，不以　見之也。幽默文學，斯爲大成。設易天下爲有道，莊子殆將不出於此。荀卿謂亂代之徵，文章匿而采，斯言也，庶幾近之。嗚呼，今有文人，生此盛世，不幸而亦以幽默見稱也！</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— Ｊｕｌｅｓ　Ｒｅｎａｒｄ作林取譯</p>
<p>開水壺</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚對於他的家庭顯得有用的機會是很少的。他隱伏在一個角落裏，窺伺着這種機會的到來。他毫無成見的傾聽着，時候一到，便從陰影裏面跑出來，好像一個在許多被熱情煩擾的人中，獨自保持着冷靜的頭腦的深思熟慮的人一様，擔任起指揮一切的責任。</p>
<p>他猜到雷辟克家的需要一個聰明而又可靠的帮助。當然，她自己不會對他說的。她很有自尊心。這合同是在彼此心領神會中成立的，紅蘿蔔鬚應當不用鼓勵，也不希望什麽酬報，自動的去幹。</p>
<p>他决定下手了。</p>
<p>從朝到晚，壁爐的鐵鈎上掛着一把開水壺。在冬天需用許多熱水的時候，這開水壺是時常被人盛滿而又倒空的，它在一爐大火上沸騰着。</p>
<p>夏天，祇在每次飯後，用得着壺裏的水去洗碗，其餘的時候，它便毫無用處的沸騰着，不斷地發出輕微的呌聲，兩片柴在它那有着裂痕的肚子底下冒着烟，差不多全要熄滅了。</p>
<p>有時奥洛林不再聽見開水壺的呌聲了，她便彎下身子把耳朶靠近聽。</p>
<p>「水都燒乾了，」她說。</p>
<p>她便拿一桶水倒在開水壺裏面，把兩片柴併攏來，把柴灰撥動一下。一會兒，那溫柔的歌聲又起來了，奥洛林放心了，便跑去做别的事情。</p>
<p>倘使有人對她說：</p>
<p>「奥洛林，你爲什麽燒些用不着的熱水呢？把開水壺拿掉罷：把火弄熄罷。你把柴是這様白燒着好像是全没有花錢買來的一様。等到天氣一冷，許多苦人凍得要命，都没有柴燒、你却暴殄天物。但你向來却又是一個省儉的婦人呀。」</p>
<p>她便會把頭搖着。</p>
<p>她一直看見竃鈞上是掛着一把開水壺的。</p>
<p>她一直聽着開水沸騰的聲音，不論是下雨，刮風，或天晴，開水壺空了，她便把它灌滿。</p>
<p>她現在簡直用不着觸到開水壺，也用不着看它了；她已記熟在心裏。她祇要聽一聽便够了，如果開水壺没有聲音，她便倒一桶水在裏面，好像穿一串珍珠似的，她已經習慣到了那様程度，至今從没有倒錯過一次。</p>
<p>她今天第一次倒錯了。</p>
<p>水都倒在火上，一團灰做成的雲霧，正像一隻被人驚擾得發怒的野獸一様，撲在奥洛林身上，包圍着她，燒灼着她，使她窒息着。</p>
<p>她發出一聽呌喊，一邊往後退，一面打着噴嚏，咳嗽。</p>
<p>「啊呀，我以爲地下跑出鬼來了呢。」她說。</p>
<p>兩眼閉得緊緊的，痛楚着，她把她那雙污黑的手在壁爐的暗處摸索着。</p>
<p>「啊！我知道了，她大吃一驚說。「開水壺已不在了。」</p>
<p>「不，我眞不懂這是什麽緣故。開水壺剛才還在這裏。這决不會錯的，因爲我聽見它像笛子一様呌着呢。」她說。</p>
<p>這開水壺是當奥洛林轉過背由窗户口上傾倒菜皮時，有人把它取去的。</p>
<p>但究竟是誰把它取去的呢？</p>
<p>雷辟克家的現得嚴肅而又寗靜的様子，在臥房門口的草墊上出現了。</p>
<p>「鬧得這様利害啦，奥洛林！」</p>
<p>「你還說鬧，你還說鬧！」奥洛林呌說。「遇着這様見鬼的事還會不鬧！我差一點燒壞了。</p>
<p>你看我的木鞋，我的裙子，我的手呀。我的衣袋裏充塞着煤塊。」（未完）</p>

<h3>三禮拜六點鐘</h3>
<p>— 牛</p>
<p>我國本有「廿一日酉時」的謎語·所謂「廿一日酉時」云者，即「醋」字也，我國男女，不若俄國的公開，本來醋性最重，男子以女子爲禁臠，女子亦以男子爲禁臠，故男女之間，一方面成有發生軌外行動者，另一方面酸性於是乎作矣，而現在花様翻新，一變其語調曰「三禮拜六點鐘」其實仍是廿一日酉時的意思，我不解人事何故必以三禮拜爲度也。，</p>
<p>歡迎各國要人，兵艦禮砲，則必嗚二十一嚮，袁世凱時代，日人提出條件，强迫我國承認，亦是二十一條，現在上海各大公司，各商號的大廉價，亦是二十一天居多，即我國從前的諺語，亦曰「不管三七二十一，」爲什麽不說四七廿八，或說四八三十二呢？嗚禮砲何以不齊齊整整，放二十嚮呢？條件爲什麽不提二十條，或索怕三十條，或四十條，而零里零頭提出廿一條呢？商店之大廉價，亦是如此，爲什麽定要二十一天？此中道理，我本來莫名其土地堂。</p>
<p>恰巧現在又被我發見一個二十一天，印度國民黨領袖聖雄甘地，於五月八日開始二十一天之戒食，以此爲反對賤民階級喪失資格之抗議，我眞是不懂，絕食是不吃飯，不吃麵包，其餘的東西也多不吃，不過據醫生云，假使一個人絕食，强者七日而死，弱者四五日而亦死，何以甘地此次絕食，預定二十一天，還不一定是死，據甘地說，「假定絕食二十一天，英政府還不答應他的要求，還願入獄，」此種食不知如何絕法，深爲奇怪，大約絕食的方法，不是頓然。絕食，是像戒烟的幾位朋友，一天一天的减少罷。</p>
<p>因甘地的絕食，我又聯想到我們的同志張少帥，亦曾經在滬絕食過二十一。天，亦竟不死，眞是奇怪，我們的同志張少帥，不是人稱我國的甘地麽？因爲。甘地是主張「無抵抗」主義者，張少帥是主張「不抵抗」主義者，不管一個是亡國。的國民，一個是有兵有槍，而又尙未亡國的少帥，是否應當抱同一主義，姑且。不論，但二人的主義，究屬相同，不妨以我國的甘地目之。</p>
<p>張少帥不但與甘地主義相同，即絕食一事，亦與甘地如出一轍，據說，張少帥此次出洋到意國去，一則休息休息他的政躬二則順便到外國去宣揚宣揚我。們的國威據少帥自己表示到外國去休息一時，還要回來爲國效勞呢娱樂不忘救。國，眞是難得，惟因意國的鴉片，尙没有公賣的緣故，又没有私土私烟可吃。諸多不便，所以决計在滬絕食二十一天，在此絕食時期，聞得十分危險，幸經。某醫生醫治得法，居然平安過去，不過據訪聞所得，此次少帥絕食，看婦竟。用到二十一名（一說十九名）之多，絕食費用到二十一萬（或云二十萬）之鉅，此種絕食，眞是較聖雄甘地更有意義呢。</p>

<h3>青春熱</h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>「你看，這件旗袍做的太短了，皮鞋跟都没有罩着，顏色也不漂亮，最好做大紅的，人家不是都穿着大紅嗎。」她說着隨手把旗袍脫下，扔在床邊，又試穿一件新的了。</p>
<p>她裝着很不高興似的對面前等候她出門的少年生氣「這件腰身太大了，把這種旗袍穿出去多難爲情，我不去了」。她故意再把旗袍脫下，對着鏡子，將屁鼓一扭，旋轉身來，步着跳舞的姿勢。</p>
<p>「這一點不合式，没有關係，你嫌不好，明天再做新的。時候不早了，去看青春熱吧丨」少年央求的說，兩眼逼視着她的襯衫内的肉體，幻想在黑暗的電影院中進行的步驟。</p>
<p>「不去，不，不····」她斜着媚眼，佯裝嬌怒的說，一面高跟皮鞋蹂着地板。</p>
<p>「我答應你再做一件大紅的，我的好妹妹」她像餓虎撲羊似的擁着她的肉體狂吻。</p>
<p>爭鬥，掙扎。</p>
<p>「誰稀罕你這個來？」她瞧着自己鏡中的蘋菓殷的臉，噪起了小嘴撒嬌。</p>
<p>「我並没有說你要呵，我們是朋友以友誼的關係再送一件大紅的衣服···哈哈···聯絡感情」他滿足似的笑了；那闊的嘴又伸到她的蘋菓臉旁；她故意閃開了，他更大胆的凑上去。</p>
<p>「討厭···」模糊的聲音</p>
<p>「去吧，時候不早了。」勝利的凱旋。</p>
<p>他敞開新旗袍的硬領，像大理石的Ｂｏｙ一様，她仍是欲理不理的扭着腰肢，終於兩枝白藕手臂穿進了衣袖。</p>
<p>鏡中人影重新工作起來，一對青春的夫婦手挽着手踏出大門，迎面吹來一股初夏的暖風。</p>
<p>「怎末這般熱？」人工的眉毛擠在一起說話。</p>
<p>「回來到辣斐花園去？」</p>
<p>同意的點頭。</p>
<p>他是某銀行長的兒子，家中有的是錢，他老子娘更特造一副像蠻牛一様的身體。蠻牛是一九三三年的標準少年，他進了某大學三年，在敎室中的時候恐怕祇能以小時計，但是每一次運動會，他的記錄特别多，他的照片，每一個運動刋物報章上都有。學校裏爲了他能奪得每次的運動錦標，居然也快到畢業的時候。她，是他同校的皇后，許多買賣玉式的小白臉，被她玩弄得厭了：於是以皇后的交際手腕，攫得了蠻牛的他，除了某種的滿足外，同時還有一個銀行在後面，皇后弔在這少年的手彎上的理由在此。</p>
<p>他也意料不到蠻牛在一九三三年交了運，旣然天生的從前以爲的缺憾可以博女人的歡心，物質上他不費力的把皇后擁到自己的懷裏。</p>
<p>他們沿着人行道慢慢的走，踏進電影院已在二十分鐘之後，青春熟的女主角露着白腿向外國蠻牛微笑。</p>
<p>在黑暗中他倆同時感到滿意的舒適，</p>

<p>她：「玩弄一個男子，只須一舉白腿！」</p>
<h3>最有靈騐的救國策</h3>
<p>— 絜廬</p>
<p>丨去勢救國論丨</p>
<p>誰不喊着「中國弱」「中國貧」，何以貧弱到這般田地？其中必有緣故。所以，甚麽「跳舞救國」「航空救國」「大刀救國」「電影救國」······等等，發明的愛國志士，虧他各抒閎議，開了一種挽救中國貧弱的方案。對不對，且等將來見效，靈不靈，未必保退還洋。</p>
<p>照在下愚見所得，最有靈騐的救國策，只有兩個字：一個是「心」字；一個是「性」字。一切的事，無論理論怎様好，口是心非，都是没效。主義，言論，方案，都屬於「人的問題」，没有「人格」和「良心」，决不能幹出好事來。所以有了一回排貨，必有一班没「人格」和「良心」的人，因此便發了財丨所以我說主義，方案，都不能夠救國，也許因此速其亡國丨第二，我說「性」字救國，難道我們貴國，多出幾位性學博士張競生先生，便使國家有救嗎？目下正鬧着戀愛，肉感的時代，負文化運動的大使命文學大家，也竭力來提倡性學，何須小子嘵舌。可是在下所說的「性字救國」，並非杜撰，確有所本，五月五日柏林電道</p>
<p>國家社會黨政府，現正考慮一種新法律，凡刑事犯及身體精神不　全之人，均將使不能生育，並將禁與異種通婚，以期改良阿里安種族　」云云，本來，猪玀的生殖率，最屬可驚，只知道「吃」「生」兩件事，不爲幹些别的事情，被人宰割，死不足惜。我們貴國人，也是如此丨「吃」不要說起，「生」的本領，也何讓於天篷將軍。而且，越窮的朋友，生的本領，越可欽佩。難道窮朋友没福研究姨太太的性學，擁着黄臉婆忒尋窮開心嗎？豈知越窮越生，越生越窮，農村破產，經濟恐慌，全世界大鬧不景氣，其癥結全在於此，豈獨中國爲然！</p>
<p>據生物學家說：「人類生殖率·是等比級數，每二十五年，增加了一倍」。試讀歷史，過了數十年或百年，必有大亂，這便是人口過剩的鐵證。况且我們中國人，體格不妨瘠弱，生殖倒很起勁，謬種流傅，毫不在心，希特勒能在德國頒布新律，用方法使歹人和身體不健全的人，不能生育，眞是富國强種的唯一法門。在下因此想得一個救國良策，便是「去勢救國諭」，不曉得袞袞諸公，採及芻蕘否？</p>
<h3>公園之遊</h3>
<p>— 貝</p>
<p>「這是天堂，輝煌燦爛的天堂呀！」</p>
<p>從生活的堆積裏逃出，拖着笨重的身軀，走近了××公園的門首，我不禁連聲的這様讚美，門警見了我的急侷近乎狼狽的色相，堵住了門檻，頻頻的從他的高吭的喉嚨裏發出「派司」「派司」第三個「派司」的呼聲。</p>
<p>「這是天堂，輝煌燦爛的天堂呀！」</p>
<p>找渡進門，筋肉一鬆地，靈魂好像在太空飄忽，我又這様讚美着。</p>
<p>在這兒，接着泛上我腦梢的情緒，是「咯咯咯」的青蛙在園池裏噪嚷，於是我停住了脚，我開始了一葉新的沉思：五千里外的故鄕，不正是這時候青蛙呌得透野的響麽，怎的却成了不好的象徵，像午夜的貓頭鷹，清晨的烏鴉呌一般的不祥，不分男女，也不分老幼，大家都丢下家，丢下田園，遠遠的向異卿飄零，只賸得父親一個子，在奄息中駐守未動，這時青蛙還在呌麽？呌又呌出怎様一種聲調呵？</p>
<p>更其遠些展開：東北三千萬同胞的啼號，浴血鏖戰的義軍的殺敵聲，該也像青蛙似的在呌嚷，然而有誰去傾聽？有誰曾聽到？</p>
<p>「看，前面那不是釘梢的麽，男的追隨在女的後面丨」希兄提示了我的注意力呵，公園原是這麽一種塲台，有了釘梢，有了戀愛該還免不了有第三個方式，丨如西新橋一帶地段的人肉賤賣的把戲我更想起了××哲學家的夫人便是從這兒釘梢釘來的，××同學的情侣，也就是這兒釘梢釘成眷屬的。</p>
<p>「呵，這更是情塲中的天堂！」我改調了我的第一句讚美。</p>
<p>兜不上一個圈子，在辣斐德路的那方，密蔭的樹叢裏，泛出「吃吃吃」的聲蕩，是一對天使在擁抱，狂吻，靈與肉在交流。</p>
<p>坐下池的邊沿，對過「拍拍拍」的鴨在打水，那聲音羼和着蜜語歌韻，在池水上波動，是遊園的人陶醉的時候了。</p>
<p>世間有善必有惡，有可人的美景，也就不免殺風景的意外掃興，從籬外擲進來的一塊又一塊的小石，顯然是被摒棄在外頭的人不平，遊客也就漸漸的稀少了。</p>
<p>天氣雖然很好，却少了一鈎新月，月，光明的月，它只是密密的雲層裏偷視，靠着華龍路的那方，正在建築一個新的浴池，工人在白熱的電光下，「釘釘釘」的放出鎚石子的鏘聲，當我們從比較弛放了的門警的視線下溜出時，已是暴風雨緊急的襲臨了。</p>

<h3>我的敎育</h3>
<p>— 魯</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>我得不到我所要的東西，由是我哭了。</p>
<p>「寳寳乖，别哭了，奶奶等下買糖給你」丨奶奶摸摸我的頭說。我還是不停，我曉得她全是哄我的。</p>
<p>「寳寳乖，别給爸聽到了，不然又要打了」。</p>
<p>我還是不停地哭。</p>
<p>「三哥快把門關上，番仔來了，三哥，快關上門」丨奶奶忽然喊了起來，三哥眞的把門關了；「寳寳不在這裏，寳寳没有哭了，番仔你不要來呀，我寳寳眞乖，他都不哭的」！</p>
<p>我嚇了，把頭鑽進奶奶的懷裏，連忙停着了哭。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>「媽媽，隔壁阿牛打我，搶了我的洋槍！」我哭着告訴媽。</p>
<p>「賤骨頭，誰呌你和那小流氓混，誰可憐你」？媽凶狠狠地駡，牽我出了廳門，拿着籐鞭子，裝要打我様</p>
<p>「你這小流氓，没人管敎的小强盜，你打人嗎？你搶人的洋槍嗎？好，今天我不放過你，小流氓丨」</p>
<p>媽又裝出要打我様，但我不怕，我曉得媽是借我來駡阿牛的。</p>
<p>阿牛的母親聽到了也搶出來，喝着阿牛。</p>
<p>「你又搶人家的東西嗎？快點拿出來，前幾天我買給你的小洋槍呢？賤東西，自己的東西丢了又要搶人家的！」</p>
<p>媽和阿牛的母親鬧了好久才停。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>時候是在秋天，院庭外的樹被風吹了散下枯葉來，許多的同居都在拾落葉子玩，我看得高很，俏俏地開了門要出去，可給是媽看見了，拉了我的手，喝道：</p>
<p>「外面風大，又要吹病了」！</p>
<p>「媽媽我要落葉子玩。」</p>
<p>「不行髒死」</p>
<p>我由是又哭了，媽拿了一粒糖塞進我的嘴。</p>
<p>（四）</p>
<p>外面鑼鼓響，今天「牛頭爺」遊街，我和媽姊在門口看。</p>
<p>「媽那個臉黑黑的是什麽人」？我指着問媽。</p>
<p>「不許指，快點合掌拜拜」。</p>
<p>我合着掌拜，媽口裏念着：「小孩子不懂事，求牛頭爺敎他。」</p>

<h3>五姬的一生（八）（續）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>八「就嫁給他罷」</p>
<p>「你上那兒去了？我等你老半天了。」</p>
<p>當她坐進房門的時候，便看着章大爺横躺在床上抽鴉片。他一見她進來便快樂的坐了起來，驚喜的向她說。</p>
<p>「哦！」於是她立刻勉强歡樂起來。「原來是你喲！你一向到那裏去了？」</p>
<p>當她坐近床邊的時候，給他抱住了。於是將他的頭貼在自己的胸前，一手摩着他的面腮，趁勢揩去了眼角邊的淚水。只聽得她柔聲的說：</p>
<p>「簡直給我想死了哩。」</p>
<p>就是這様輕輕的一句，看得出已經錐入了章大爺的心坎，因爲他將她抱得更緊了。其後她被按住雙手滾在床上，章大爺整個的身體壓了上來，打架似的衣裳的鈕扣也給他撕碎了。在一陣按摩之後，她終於躺在他的身旁給他燒烟了，身疲力竭，手也抬不起來。等她小心的燒好了一夥烟泡的時候，剛好把烟槍對他嘴邊送去，却見他呼呼的睡着了。這時候他狠狠看着他一笑，自己落得放下烟槍休息休息。</p>
<p>忽然隔壁房裏傳來一陣惱怒的懇求的聲音，她聽得出這又是同伴們在遭受强暴。</p>
<p>「不，不要這様呀！······喏···我喊呌的·······哈哈······哎喲···哈哈···誰來呀！······哪·人來了·難爲情的······哎喲······哈哈哈哈······」</p>
<p>接上是打碎了碗盞的聲音，女人在掙扎抵抗。最後女人終掙脫開了，喘着氣，一陣哄笑，到門外去了。其後又是使人怪煩亂的胡琴聲。</p>
<p>柳姑娘這時不免重重的嘆了一口氣，坐起來順手摩着油光的頭髮，果然有幾根已經亂了。反正睡也睡不着的，索興走到鏡邊梳頭去了。</p>
<p>她喝了一杯茶，再燃上一根烟，嘴裏吐着大小不等和烟圈，小圈兒打從大圈兒中鑽過去，不久，都消失了。</p>

<h3>麗琳哈蕙到底結過婚没有</h3>
<p>— 福偷</p>
<p>好萊塢以及美國全國的影迷們，今日惟一欲知的問題，就是這位歐洲的美艷明星麗琳哈蕙到底是已婚的，還是未婚的。據麗琳自己說他並未結過婚，亦没有訂過婚。但是據德國烏發公司方面的傅說，麗琳哈蕙確是一位已嫁之羅敷。她的丈夫就是和她在烏發公司中同事的男主角，惠立茀里區Ｗillb　Fritscb並且稱他們的婚姻，呌做歐洲的范朋克璧克馥結合（The　Fairbanks　Pickford　Comdination　of　Ｅurope）。兩方面各執一詞，呌人相信誰呢？</p>
<p>烏發的傅說，有什麽證據呢？說來亦很有趣。據說有兩位梁上君子，因爲聽見哈蕙女士有許多鑽石，其中有一顆有二十五加拉重。所以他們特地半夜去拜訪哈蕙的住宅。他們從水管爬上了她的樓房，掩進了她的寢室。電燈突然亮了，他們看見麗琳睡在床上，香夢方酣，床邊上坐著一個男子·手中握著手槍。兩位梁上君子，雖感覺到進退維谷，但他們記得報上登過麗琳是未婚的女子，所以他們就向那男子道：「你放我們去不放我們去？你要是不放我們去的話；我可就要宣佈你們的秘密了。」</p>
<p>「儘管，儘管，」那男子說時，還帶著些微笑。「報紙上登載什麽我却不怕。我和哈蕙小姐秘密結婚，已經三個月了，我就是惠立茀里區，大槪你們亦知道。」但是惠立茀里區終久把兩位梁上君子釋放了。後來他們向他人傅說這段故事，這就是烏發所說的麗琳已經結婚的根據了。</p>
<p>麗琳哈蕙一到美國，美國新聞記者　一句問她的話，就是「你的丈夫什麽時候來會你？」至麗琳竟搖著頭，說她　　有丈夫。人家再問她，既没有丈夫，爲什麽烏發公司方面，要說她是有丈夫的呢？她說那是烏發公司的宣傅作用，就是那梁上君子的一段故事，亦是舍有宣傅作用的。人家又問她和惠立茀里區的交誼怎様？她說「我和惠立，已在無數影片中合作過。我們日夜在一起工作，在無數影迷的面前，表演戀愛。當然我們不能無動於中，但我們能表演戀愛。亦能解脫戀愛。我小的時候，還和一位郵政局的信發生過愛情呢！」</p>
<p>「報紙上登載我結婚的消息，已經不知道多少次，連我自己都記不清，那些男子之中有大公，有伯爵，有美國的富翁，形形式式，不一而足。但我到現在，還是自由之身，比我頭上飛過的烏，還要自由些！」</p>
<p>麗琳蕙哈自己說，她這次到美國來，對於婚姻的問題，「胸中還毫無成見。」她崇拜美國的男子。她說美國的男子，比柏林的好，非但相貌好看些，並且聰明活潑，和他國的男子不同。她在美國男子的當中，覺得自在適意，毫無拘束。她說美國的女子，亦比歐洲的女子好看，身段瘦小，面貌姣好些。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「血書」的商酌</h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>月明公司繼「大丈夫」「她的心」後的「血書」，已經在中央公映了。我仍本着愛護國片的熱情，來領略這一部新作品。雖然仍未能完全使我滿意，但至少較從前好了些。不過關於故事上的意識，仍是一個平俗的戀愛追求，而不能給我們一點新頴的啓示。關於技巧與表情方面，也未有進步，茲將該劇中不妥之數點提出商酌之。</p>
<p>（一）鍾雨青贈玉娟小照，上寫着「玉娟吾愛」等字様。而其兄牛二必欲據爲已有，雖云憨愚，未免太做作。</p>
<p>（二）玉娟逃出火坑後，冒險前往尋雨青，於途中忽遇一態。城鄕咫尺之地，而能有此野獸，已屬罕聞，且態之鼻端有一巨環，爲人所圈養者，無疑。愚意此節盡可不必。</p>
<p>（三）玉娟在客棧嚼指血書，吞金自盡，但至大團圓時仍健在。如何得救並未叙明，實爲最大漏洞。</p>
<p>（四）雨青携牛二夜至莫作民别墅，飛身上房，行走如飛，大有舊小說意味，而爲大破火燒等落伍影片遺毒，令人寒心。</p>
<p>（五）房内佈景電話沙發備極奢華，室外情形則又荒草野木悽凉異常，使人幾不知城市歟？仰荒村歟？服裝亦殊多矛盾。</p>
<p>（六）說明書中有云玉娟夜宿古寺懦退　盜，得洋以作路費。但片中並無此　，　作民被殺時說明書中云家人紛紛而出但片中亦無事實，諸如此端皆導演者不能周密策劃，設觀者不讀說明書，則更不知其所云矣。</p>
<p>以上各點非無補救之可能，願導演者也有以糾正之也。</p>
<p>明星公司聲片「脂粉市場」不日將在新光公映。該片導演者爲張石川君，由胡蝶，龔稼農，嚴月閒等主演</p>
<p>愛麗絲游歷記</p>
<h3>將製爲電影</h3>
<p>著名小說家路易士卡路之傑作「愛麗絲遊歷記」一書，將在奸萊塢製爲電影，並由瑪麗畢克馥任劇中愛麗絲一角，范朋克適在羅馬乘車參加意大利高而夫球香檳賽，路透社記者特走訪之，據范云，該片充滿平靜安嫻之空氣，將爲影劇中别開生面者，而該劇中祇有畢克馥爲惟一之眞人，其餘者係假人，范朋克表示彼希望下次製片時將來中國攝製，但須將一切應用之器具由好萊塢搬來東方，故至少需欵一百，十萬元，但以現時影業市塲觀之，恐難負擔如此巨欵也云云，（路透羅馬通訊）</p>
<h3>最近將映的國產影片</h3>
<p>— 依依</p>
<p>電影題材的一般傾向</p>
<p>自從這一次電影界有了復興的轉機，國產電影界頓然呈現了蓬蓬勃勃的氣象；而一般觀衆，也轉移了注意好萊塢影片的目光，對於國產影片表示盛大熱烈的歡迎。最近，據我調查所得，在這一旬裏面，本埠將要有四張國產影片開映，特爲讀者諸君介紹於下：</p>
<p>（一）明星公司出品的「脂粉市場」，張石川導演，胡蝶，龔稼農，嚴月閒等主演。本月十四日在新光公映。</p>
<p>（二）明星公司出品「前程」，張石川導演，宣景琳，孫敏，朱秋痕等主演，最近十日内在上海中央同時開映，確期未定。</p>
<p>（三）聯華公司出品「除夕」，姜起鳳導演，陳燕燕，劉繼羣，蔣君超主演；有與「脂粉市塲」同日在北京公映消息。</p>
<p>（四）天一公司出品「生機」，邵醉翁導演，陳玉梅，袁美雲，張振鐸主演；將在旬日内開映，確期未定。</p>
<p>以上四片，兩片有聲，兩片無聲。可注意的一點是：除了「除夕」的劇情記者不甚清楚外，其餘三片，都是有關於婦女問題的，從這裏我們可以看出，自從「女性的呐喊」公映以後，國產電影的題材，「婦女問題」似乎變成一般的傾向了。</p>
<h3>「到何處去」？</h3>
<p>— 因</p>
<p>藝華公司處女作</p>

<h3>電影小說秘密（Ｓｅｃｒｅｔｓ）（七）</h3>
<p>— 開羅</p>
<p>「曼麗！」約翰在外面喊著。「沈香受傷了，你快來！」</p>
<p>曼麗猶如夢醒的一般，她連忙將小約翰硬直的身體放進搖床；將身子站一站直，用手背擦去了眼中的眼淚，奔了出去。她正替沈香紮著傷口，忽然屋子裏濃烟四起，她抬起頭看看屋頂的天竄，但見紅臉傑克爬在天窗口，一只手用火把放火，一只手拿著手槍正想向約翰開放。曼麗如得神助似的，迅卽將沈香擲在一旁的槍取過來，對准紅臉傑克砰然一聲，紅臉傑克像死烏似的從天窗裏跌了進來，死在地上。</p>
<p>門外遠處又聽見一陣馬蹄疾馳之聲。繼著就是呐喊和槍聲。約翰聽了一回，忽然快活地喊道「那是麥高芬醫生，帶了地方警察來了！」這一支生力軍就將一羣偷牛賊，打得落花流水，四散奔逃。而一塲幾瀕於危的惡戰，亦卽就此告終，約翰還得了一次全勝，曼麗的功勞，當然亦不少了。</p>

<p>這一天又是個大宴會的日子。卡頓已被推舉爲加利福尼亞省的候選省長，這是第一次慶祝跳舞大會。沈香亦著了大禮服，在如雲的賓客之中走來走去，聽著那閣者宣告著各貴客的姓名。内中忽然來了一位豓麗的西班牙少婦，閣者宣告著她的姓名「麥汀納茲小姐。」沈香齊巧立在一對男女客人的旁邊。祇聽見他們竊竊議論著。那女的道：「她怎麽這様胆大！」那男的道：「卡頓發瘋了，帶這種女人到家裏來！」</p>
<p>沈香眼光四射地尋找約翰和曼麗。約翰的形狀係滿面羞慚，曼麗也覺得侷促不安，而那位麥汀納茲小姐已近向主人主婦的前面了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Enemy Divides into Two Wings to Outflank Our Retreat</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy at Gubeikou, late on the 10th, with a regiment under cover of intense artillery fire, attacked our Shangdianzi position. By noon on the 11th, the enemy sent over five hundred soldiers. Because our side was prepared, they divided their forces, part resisting Shangdianzi, and another part splitting into two wings to outflank our army's retreat. Near Bijia Mountain, our entire Wei Regiment met them head-on. The enemy suffered over five hundred dead and wounded, retreating hastily. The Wei Regiment took the opportunity to pursue, with both sides engaging and disengaging six times, suffering heavy casualties. By the time it became clear on the 11th, two squadrons of enemy aircraft were assisting in the battle, dropping dozens of heavy bombs weighing over 200 pounds each. Simultaneously, the artillery at Badaolouzi, Heilongtan, and Nantianmen 400 Highland concentrated their firepower with the left wing as the center, firing in rapid succession. The entire Wei Regiment, both officers and soldiers, suffered heavy casualties, with about a quarter killed or wounded. Regiment Commander Wei Wei was wounded, and Deputy Regiment Commander Jiang Dianjia was killed by a bomb. Our side suffered particularly heavy casualties in this battle. The elite troops of the Japanese 8th Division also suffered around 2,000 casualties. According to our army, we recovered about a hundred enemy corpses. Along the way, transport vehicles were destroyed by enemy aircraft in Huairou, about five or six vehicles.

<h3>Xu Tingyao Orders Full-Line Counterattack</h3>

<p>Japanese Aircraft Return to Ping to Demonstrate Power</p>
<p>Our Anti-Aircraft Artillery Fires into the Air</p>
<p>Several Shells Land in Civilian Homes</p>
<p>Japanese State That They Will Not Drop Bombs</p>
<p>(Beiping) One enemy aircraft, at 5:45 this morning, again flew from the northwest to Ping, circling inside and outside the city for reconnaissance for three weeks. Whenever enemy aircraft flew over the streets, our anti-aircraft artillery, machine guns, and rifles concentrated fire. The enemy aircraft soared at more than 3,000 meters, avoiding our fire, and finally flew northwest at 6:10. Residents, due to the simultaneous sounds of our guns and cannons, all got up and went to the courtyard to look up. Local order is still stable. Enemy aircraft scattered leaflets again this morning, about one foot square, titled "Advice to Chinese Soldiers," signed "Japanese Military Commander-in-Chief, Showa 8th Year, Datong 2nd Year," containing much instigation and insulting words. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain agency used a telescope to see that there were two people in the enemy aircraft flying to Ping this morning, one driving and one taking pictures. Last night, the Public Security Bureau sent police to inform merchants and civilians that if enemy aircraft came to attack, they should all close their doors to avoid falling into the enemy's tricks. This morning, the anti-aircraft machine guns at a certain place fired more frequently, and the enemy aircraft also returned fire once. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Three enemy aircraft arrived in Beiping this morning to demonstrate power. One aircraft was reconnoitering in the suburbs, and two aircraft went to the sky above the city to scatter leaflets and open fire with machine guns to demonstrate power. People were shocked. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When the enemy aircraft came to Ping this morning, a shell landed in the courtyard of actor Zhu Qinxin at No. 3 Yangyi Hutong, Dongdan. It was an unfired shell from our anti-aircraft artillery. A shell from an anti-aircraft gun also landed on the roof of the Xiaoxiaoribao newspaper office on Cotton Head Alley, Xuanwai. The tiles were broken, but it did not explode. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today at more than 3:00 PM, another enemy aircraft flew from the north to Ping, reconnoitering in the area outside Andingmen, without dropping bombs, circling twice before leaving. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Bao Yulin Advises Citizens to Remain Calm</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Bao Yulin said that an enemy aircraft flew over Beiping City for reconnaissance at dawn today. This kind of unintentional act is irrelevant to military affairs. Enemy aircraft have repeatedly bombed the front line, but few people have been injured. Our air defense equipment is very thorough. Our merchants and civilians should remain calm. The citizens of Beiping are indignant at the Japanese aircraft, but as Beiping is close to the war zone, it was expected long ago, and there is no panic. However, the foreign residents of Beiping City are paying close attention to this. In addition to sending telegrams to inquire to our authorities, many also sent telegrams to their respective countries to report. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese State That They Will Not Drop Bombs</h3>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, a representative who claimed to be from the former Japanese police station came to our First District Office and formally stated that the Japanese army has been coming to Ping in recent days only for reconnaissance and will not drop bombs. Please convey this intention to the Public Security Bureau. The Japanese have always been untrustworthy and full of deceit. What is the intention of this statement? It is worthy of attention. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Prelude to an Invasion of Pingjin?</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Japanese aircraft flew to Ping for reconnaissance on the 11th and 12th. The political circles attach great importance to this and observe that this move by the Japanese aircraft will be the prelude to the Japanese army's invasion of Pingjin. Invading Pingjin has long been a pre-determined plan of the Japanese army, but they fear causing international disputes, especially fearing interference from Britain and the United States. Therefore, after our Finance Minister Song went to the United States, the Japanese fabricated rumors, saying that Song had asked the US government to come out and interfere when the Japanese army invaded Pingjin. The purpose was to force the US side to express its attitude. As expected, the US government issued a declaration, saying that even if the Japanese army invaded Pingjin, the US government would not guarantee to come out and interfere. The arrogance of the Japanese has reached this point and they have become spoiled by fate, making them even more reckless. Therefore, the situation in Pingjin has become extremely serious. Our country is facing the most serious juncture. The whole country, from top to bottom, must unite as one to meet the difficulties. (12th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British People Pay Close Attention</h3>
<p>(Washington) Since the news of Japanese aircraft flying over Beiping and scattering leaflets arrived here, it has aroused great attention from the Americans. All international issues have taken a back seat. Currently, both the Chinese and Japanese embassies have not made any statements. Some American officials say that according to two independent and reliable sources, the Japanese army will not occupy Beiping because the Japanese do not want to cause international disputes to hinder the discussions of the Washington and World Economic Conferences.

<p>All Resolutely Repelled by Our Army</p>
<h3>Qian'an and Lulong Armies Confront Each Other Across the River</h3>
<p>(Luanzhou) The issue of the Japanese army continuing to attack the west bank of the Luan River is likely to expand.

On the morning of the 12th, they continued to try to cross the river at the East-West Gorge, but were also repelled. This morning, they even used aircraft to release smoke bombs to cover the crossing, but it was ineffective. In the Lulong area, the enemy shelled Qianhoushiti at a high ground near Wendao Pagoda. From dawn to early morning, they shelled every five minutes, with three to five shots falling on the mountains. In the morning, the enemy at Luojiadian attempted to cross the river several times, but were repelled by Shen's division. By morning, the enemy artillery densely shelled Gaotaizi. This evening, in the Luanzhou area, the enemy destroyed the railway bridge west of Anshan in eastern Luan. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) The Japanese army continued to attack western Luan, still focusing on the areas of Lulong, Qian'an, and Luotun Valley, because the river is narrow and the water is shallow in those areas, making it easy to build bridges to cross the river, especially in the Luotun area, which is very suitable for wading. This morning, the enemy shelled the west bank in the Qian'an and Bailong areas, hoping to cross the river, but was repelled. In the Luotun area, they were also repelled several times. At noon, the enemy artillery fire was dense, and smoke bombs were released. The enemy tried to cross the river from Renzikou under the cover and attacked Gaotaizi. Soon, a part crossed the river and landed. Shen's division is encircling and annihilating them. At 1:00 PM, more than a thousand enemy reinforcements arrived in Lulong, including more than two hundred people. They also requisitioned a large number of wooden rafts in Caijiafen to prepare to cross the river. We have strengthened our defenses. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

On the 11th, the enemy dragged over a thousand laborers on the opposite bank of the Sahua River, seemingly preparing for battle. Based on observing the enemy's intentions, if Gubeikou cannot be violated, they will turn to attack Xifengkou. The situation there is extremely important. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>British House of Lords Discusses Far East Problem</p>
<h3>Cecil Advocates</h3>
<h3>Economic Sanctions Against Japan</h3>
<p>Secretary of War Says This Suggestion Difficult to Implement</p>
<p>Britain Still Cooperates Closely with the League of Nations</p>
<p>Only Deeply Concerned About Causing War</p>
<p>(London) Secretary of War Lord Hailsham stated in the House of Lords today that the British government's Far East policy has always been to act as a loyal member of the League of Nations, seeking the closest possible cooperation and consultation with other members of the League of Nations. The Secretary of War's remarks were in response to the statements of Viscount Cecil, who initiated a debate on the Far East and disarmament events, seconded by Baron Palmer. Cecil advocated inviting other countries to cooperate and impose commercial bans on Japan. Secretary of War Hailsham replied that such suggestions were difficult to implement. The British-Japanese commercial treaty contains most-favored-nation clauses. Unless a twelve-month notice is given in advance, this commercial treaty cannot be canceled. British Foreign Secretary Simon can certainly consider this suggestion, but this must not be regarded as an indication that the British government intends to submit such a suggestion to Geneva. If this suggestion is implemented, he will not believe that Britain will not cause a war in the shortest period of time. Therefore, this suggestion must undergo the longest, most serious and most thorough consideration before it can be accepted. The British government is currently cooperating carefully with other countries in Geneva on the Far East issue. Britain is considering this matter with the sincere desire to fulfill its obligations as a member of the League of Nations. Britain is deeply aware that the slightest careless action could promote the crisis that Lord Cecil seeks to avoid. (11th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Japanese Aircraft Carrier</p>
<p>Moved to Outside Dagu Port</p>
<h3>Japanese Warship Hoists British Flag to Survey Coastal Water Depth</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese aircraft carrier Ryūjō suddenly sailed from Beidaihe to the sea off Dagu yesterday afternoon. Japanese soldiers in Tanggu are busy building fortifications, and people in Tanggu are panicking. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to Dagu fishermen, twelve warships sailed to the sea forty miles outside the port on the night of the 11th. They did not hoist flags and prevented fishing boats from approaching to spy. It is expected that they are enemy warships. We have strengthened our defenses. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 2:00 PM on the 12th, six aircraft from the enemy aircraft carrier outside Dagu Port soared outside the port for two or thirty minutes before flying back to the ship. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Emperor sent Adjutant Colonel Anan to Tianjin on the 16th by destroyer to comfort the Japanese army. (12th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The enemy warship Kinkei Maru hoisted the British flag at 2:00 PM on the 11th and sailed to Dagu Port. It was intercepted by the customs and found to be a Japanese warship after inspection. Fortunately, there were no munitions on board. It was allowed to change the Japanese flag and enter the port and stopped at the Japanese military camp wharf in Tanggu. After our investigation, the ship was surveying the depth of the coastal waters and whether there were any reefs. Sure enough, at 10:00 AM on the 12th, an enemy aircraft carrier was discovered near a light ship sixty miles outside Dagu Port. There were also three battleships to protect it.

<p>Rare Phenomenon</p>
<h3>Japanese Prisons are Full</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to an investigation by the Criminal Affairs Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Justice, the number of convicted persons increased by more than 14,000 in the past year, which is a rare phenomenon in recent times. The trend is still increasing, there is advancement without retreat. All 43 prisons and ten branches in the country are full and there is no room for placement. The increase in urban criminals is even more ferocious. The four major prisons in Tokyo and the Fukuoka Prison have long been unable to accommodate new prisoners. It is also necessary to transfer old prisoners to local prisons. The cost of transferring prisoners in the past year has exceeded 140,000 to 150,000 yuan. If this continues, four or five new large prisons must be built this year to meet the current emergency. Within the Ministry of Justice, the talk of prisoner immigration is very popular.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Desires for the North China Political Affairs Committee</h3>
<p>Recently, the central government, recognizing the urgency of the situation in North China, and the need for strong leadership in military planning and maintaining order, has established the North China Political Affairs Committee as the highest authority responsible for planning and coordination to achieve effective response. Now, Chairman Huang Fu is about to go north to take office. The important mission of the North China Political Affairs Committee is about to begin. We cannot help but offer a few words of encouragement to the North China Political Affairs Committee.</p>
<p>The recent perilous situation in North China is almost as precarious as a swallow's nest on a curtain. The enemy army has already seized Jehol and is advancing southward with thunderous force. Their ambition is clear to all. At this time, the North is relying on a small number of battle-weary troops to resist the strong enemy and protect Tianjin. However, the enemy possesses powerful weapons and is moving a large army, sweeping across the land like a storm. Twenty days ago, Miyun, only about a hundred miles from Peiping, had already been bombed, and today enemy planes have been sighted in the skies over Peiping. The perilous situation in Peiping is foreseeable. If Peiping is lost, all of North China will be gone. Thinking of this, we cannot help but feel grief, anger, and sorrow. The North China Political Affairs Committee is being established precisely at this moment to shoulder this critical situation. Therefore, it is of utmost importance to strengthen unity and mobilize all forces to deal with it. This is the first point.</p>
<p>Recently, the enemy army has been attacking and seizing our key passes along the Great Wall. At the same time, they are using money to buy off a large number of shameless and degenerate vagrants and politicians to infiltrate Peiping and Tianjin, plotting to respond from within. Zhang Jingyao, who was recently killed by patriotic youth in Peiping at the Six Nations Hotel, is one example. However, this was only fortunately discovered by our patriotic youth in Peiping. There must still be many others who have been bought off by the enemy, lurking in various parts of North China, willing to act as accomplices, and who have not yet been discovered. Such conscienceless individuals are the public enemies of our nation. In maintaining the overall situation in North China, the North China Political Affairs Committee should pay close attention to this point, ensuring that these ugly characters have no place to stand and that their conspiracies are thwarted, in order to protect the tranquility of the rear. This is the second point.</p>
<p>Zhang Xueliang's failure was due to his consistent lack of resistance, losing territory and disgracing the nation, and was therefore abandoned by the people. Now that the North China Political Affairs Committee has been established, it must focus on military affairs in addition to politics, seeking to be different from Zhang Xueliang. In other words, those who previously did not resist must now actively resist, and only then can they live up to the heavy trust of the country and the ardent expectations of the people. This is the third point.</p>
<p>The situation is urgent! The situation is perilous! The fate of North China today hangs by a thread. Our North China Political Affairs Committee has been appointed to this critical mission. How will it work diligently and wholeheartedly to maintain it, so that Peiping and Tianjin do not become a continuation of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Jehol, and extend the life of the nation by even a slim chance? This difficult and weighty responsibility now rests on the shoulders of the gentlemen of the North China Political Affairs Committee. May they remember it.</p>
<h3>Confirmed Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<h3>Soviet Russia Tries to Avoid Conflict with Japan</h3>
<p>Strange words from Litvinov!</p>
<p>Claiming the Chinese government has failed to fulfill its obligations for eighteen months.</p>
<p>Believing it has lost the moral rights contained in the agreement.</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov mentioned today China's request to be consulted on the Soviet-“Manchukuo” Chinese Eastern Railway dispute. According to Soviet semi-official news agency reports, Litvinov said that the Nanjing government or those in power under its control have ceased to be real partners with the Soviet Union regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway. According to the Peiping-Shenyang Agreement, the Chinese government must send representatives to attend the Railway Bureau. However, in the past eighteen months, the Chinese government has not sent a representative, so it has lost its moral rights contained in the agreement. Litvinov then mentioned the Sino-Soviet dispute in 1929, saying that the Russian government, in order to eliminate the cause of the conflict, had negotiated with Chinese representative Mo Dehui to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, these negotiations were interrupted by the Manchurian Incident. For these reasons, we proposed to sell the railway. Our proposal is a demonstration of Soviet Russia's emphasis on peace, and the Peiping-Shenyang Agreement does not give China the right to redeem the railway before a certain period, nor does it restrict Soviet Russia from selling the railway to any country, especially to a country that is now in Manchuria and fulfilling the responsibilities China assumed under the Peiping-Shenyang Agreement. China has been unable to fulfill its responsibilities in Manchuria for eighteen months, so it has lost the moral right to protest the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Litvinov also said that the Chinese Ambassador to Moscow, Dr. Yan Huiqing, has tacitly acknowledged that China no longer has the ability to fulfill its obligations in Manchuria. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet Union did indeed propose selling the Chinese Eastern Railway to Japan or "Manchukuo." This was confirmed by Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov in his answers to questions from TASS. Litvinov said, "In my conversation with Japanese Ambassador Ota, I did mention the serious situation of the Chinese Eastern Railway caused by the actions of the 'Manchukuo' authorities, and the issue of its potential to increase the disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan-'Manchukuo'. In order to find a possible solution to the dispute, I mentioned the possibility of 'Manchukuo' redeeming the Chinese Eastern Railway, meaning that the Soviet Union would sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to the Manchukuo authorities as the most urgent method to resolve the current difficulties. The Chinese government did send a telegram inquiring about this matter, opposing the Soviet government selling the Chinese Eastern Railway to anyone other than the Chinese government. The Chinese ambassador also sent a memorandum to our country regarding this matter. However, the reasons given by the Chinese government do not conform to the formal treaty commitments and the actual situation. The Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian Agreements do not stipulate China's right to redeem the Chinese Eastern Railway before a certain period, nor do they restrict the Soviet Union from selling the railway to others, especially if the other party is an existing force in Manchuria, and is actually exercising the rights and obligations of the Chinese side in the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian Agreements. Moreover, in the past eighteen months, the Chinese government and its subordinate forces have, in fact, ceased to be actual co-operators with the Soviet Union on the Chinese Eastern Railway. This possible loss is not due to the Soviet Union. The Chinese government has been unable to exercise its rights and obligations in accordance with the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian Agreements. In the past eighteen months, the Chinese government has also been unable to keep its representatives on the Chinese Eastern Railway Board of Directors in accordance with the treaty. The Chinese government has been unable to report the Manchurian authorities' violations of the Chinese Eastern Railway's interests, nor has it attempted to protect the normal operation of the railway. Therefore, the Chinese government's failure to fulfill its obligations under the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian Agreements in the past eighteen months has caused it to lose the formal and moral rights obtained from the agreement. When the current Chinese Ambassador to Moscow, Dr. Yan Huiqing, and I negotiated the resumption of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations in Geneva, Ambassador Yan proposed that both sides exchange documents acknowledging the inviolability of the Sino-Russian and Feng-Russian Agreements. I accepted this proposal, but with a reservation, saying that the situation in Manchuria was changing and that the Chinese government should not lose the possibility of fulfilling its treaty responsibilities. At that time, the Chinese government opposed this reservation, because it was impossible in reality. I believe that the above proves that the Chinese government cannot oppose the Soviet Union's sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, especially selling it to the Manchurian authorities. As for the Soviet Union's motives for selling the Chinese Eastern Railway, a few can be mentioned as follows: The Tsarist government's construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway in foreign Manchurian territory was undoubtedly for imperialist purposes. The Soviet government never had such purposes. After the October Revolution, the Chinese Eastern Railway ceased to be a tool of aggression. However, because the construction cost of the railway came from the Soviet people, the Soviet government had to protect its ownership and interests on the railway. The Soviet government always wanted to sell the railway to China, but the latter was unable to purchase it. Therefore, in order to protect its ownership and interests on the railway, the Soviet government changed the railway into a purely commercial operation, and because it passed through foreign territory, it gave the owner of that territory equal management rights and half of the profits to show fairness. However, the Chinese Eastern Railway often became a source of disputes between the Soviet Union, China, and Manchuria. We can all recall the conflict on the Chinese Eastern Railway in 1929. To remove this source of conflict, the Soviet government negotiated with the representatives of Shenyang and the Chinese government, Mo Dehui, in 1930 to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. These negotiations were interrupted in the autumn of 1931 due to the Manchurian Incident. Now the issue of selling the Chinese Eastern Railway has matured again. For the reasons mentioned above, the Soviet Union proposed to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. Our proposal has repeatedly shown the peaceful intentions of the Soviet government. We believe that those who oppose this are doing so out of a desire to see the relationship between Japan and Russia or Russia and Manchuria become strained," (TASS, 11th).</p>
<p>Rudy Reports to the Council</p>
<h3>Eastern Section Plunged into Terror</h3>
<p>(Moscow) News received here from Blagoveshchensk says that Rudy, the director of the Chinese Eastern Railway, made a report to the Chinese Eastern Railway Council on May 7, describing the disturbances suffered by the eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway in recent months, which are extremely terrifying, and that work is almost impossible to carry on. At the same time, he praised the railway employees for continuing to maintain operations under constant threat, and finally requested the Council to take appropriate measures to protect the safety of the railway and ensure the normal operation of the entire line. According to Rudy's report, from the beginning of 1932 to May 5, 1933, the Chinese Eastern Railway suffered enormous losses, with 56 people killed, 825 injured, and 593 kidnapped. Most of the kidnapped employees who were released were unable to work due to severe abuse, and most are still under medical treatment. Those who have not been released are still enduring abuse. During the same period, more than 1,000 railway workers were robbed, 50 locomotives, 958 passenger cars, and 855 freight cars were destroyed, and the railway track was damaged in 53 places, covering about 4,000 meters. In addition, 124 civilian houses were destroyed, and postal and telegraph offices were attacked 775 times. The total amount of this destruction and the losses suffered by the railway due to the suspension of passenger and freight transport amounted to several million rubles. In the more serious incidents of destruction, locomotives and passenger and freight cars collapsed on the side of the road and have not yet been repaired. In fact, most of the bridges and tunnels that should have been guarded were not guarded, and as a result, they were taken advantage of and destroyed. Furthermore, most of the stations on the Eastern Line had no guards, or if they did, they did not perform their duties. At stations such as Samokhvalovo and Hengdaohezi, the collected funds were often stolen, and thieves dared to swagger openly in the stations, treating the railway police as if they did not exist, and were able to use the railway's post office telegrams without hindrance. Rudy went on to describe the admirable way in which the railway workers risked their lives and endured hunger to carry out their work, and then listed the measures he had proposed to prevent railway incidents, namely: (1) Passenger and freight cars should only be allowed to run during the daytime; (2) The speed of trains between Imanpo and Muling should be slowed down; (3) A reconnaissance car should be used in front of passenger cars; (4) The security of passenger cars should be strengthened, etc. However, he said that these measures had no effect at all, and the banditry suffered by the Eastern Railway continued to increase. Rudy recently proposed the following matters for the Council's adoption: (1) Reduce the number of passenger cars between Imanpo and Suifenhe to two per week; (2) Reduce freight cars to an extreme extent, to the point of abolishing passenger car regulations; (3) Close all unguarded stations; (4) Instruct the railway police headquarters to add armored vehicles to all passenger car runs; (5) Add guards to freight cars; (6) Add armed guards in certain sections. Rudy said that the above items are also not the final solution, as they would be costly and may not be sufficient to guarantee normal traffic. Therefore, the Council should take the necessary measures to establish an appropriate security county to fully guarantee the safe operation of the entire eastern section of the Chinese Eastern Railway.

<p>Deadline for Russia to Return Locomotives Expires</p>
<h3>Red Army Gathers in the Maritime Province</h3>
<p>(Harbin) According to officials of the puppet Manchukuo here, Soviet Russia is currently gathering troops in the Maritime Province of eastern Siberia. Five thousand fresh Soviet troops, led by a brigade commander, have arrived in a village near Durilogg, north of Vladivostok, on the Russian-Manchu border. An official from the puppet Manchukuo command in Mishan inquired with the Russian authorities about the reason for the troop increase, and was told that it was for bandit suppression. It is reported that the people of the Maritime Province are now fleeing into puppet Manchukuo, saying that the Soviet authorities openly stated that Japan wants to send troops into the Maritime Province on the pretext of the Chinese Eastern Railway case. If that happens, the Soviet Union will temporarily abandon the province, but will return to the province in the future, and the final victory will belong to the Soviet Union. According to official claims, "Manchukuo's" ultimatum to Soviet Russia to return the train will expire at midnight on May 12. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

However, the (puppet) Manchukuo Ministry of Transportation said that there was a precedent for the cross-section of the line with the Tao'an Line, and it did not infringe on any rights or interests, so it decided to start construction as planned on the 15th.

This kind of rhetoric will be seen in the reply to Russia, which is now being drafted and will soon be sent to Moscow. The deadline for "Manchukuo" to demand that Soviet Russia return the vehicles expires tonight. Unless there is a satisfactory reply, Russian-"Manchu" relations will become strained. The Japanese authorities hope for a friendly resolution, but the Japanese claim that they do not want to interfere in "Manchukuo's" foreign policy. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Russian Railway Workers Prepare for General Strike</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppets Pre-Plan Countermeasures</h3>
<p>(Changchun) The deadline for (puppet) Manchukuo to demand that Soviet Russia return the Chinese Eastern Railway locomotives and freight cars is this month, May 12. Although (puppet) Manchukuo has discussed the final countermeasures with Director of Railways Morita and others, in view of Soviet Russia's lack of sincerity, it is believed that a satisfactory solution is hopeless, so the relationship between Russia and "Manchukuo" has suddenly become dangerous. The Soviet side knows that (puppet) Manchukuo will definitely take a second tough measure, and in order to counter it, it is mobilizing a general strike of all Russian employees along the Chinese Eastern Railway. Under this battle, secret orders have been issued to these employees. On the one hand, (puppet) Manchukuo is preparing employees in Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin and other places to await orders in order to prevent this general strike. On the other hand, the Soviet side has taken steps to incite the employees to riot and plans to destroy the water pipes of the entire line. The situation is very serious.

<p>Foreign Ministry Spokesman Discusses</p>
<h3>The Russian Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Regardless of Treaties and International Faith</p>
<p>Will Lodge a Serious Protest in the Coming Days</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry discussed the Chinese Eastern Railway affair. When Ambassador Yan met with Soviet Deputy Foreign Commissar Karakhan on the 9th to deliver a note, Karakhan denied that the Soviet government had proposed to sell the railway. However, on the 11th, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov openly declared when meeting with reporters that China had lost its rights under the 1924 Sino-Soviet Agreement, and bluntly admitted that it was preparing to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. It is truly astonishing that he should reverse himself so quickly in just two days. Our government will lodge a serious protest in the coming days, refuting this with reason in order to protect our country's rights. It is deeply regrettable that this event, which disregards treaties and international faith, has occurred only a few months after the resumption of Sino-Soviet diplomatic relations. (Central News Agency, 12th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After our Foreign Ministry instructed Ambassador Yan to send a note regarding Soviet Russia's sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway's rights and interests to Japan, Soviet Foreign Commissar Karakhan replied to Ambassador Yan, saying that the Soviet Union did not propose to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway. However, news came that Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov yesterday issued a declaration saying that Soviet Russia was preparing to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway, and that the Sino-Soviet Agreement had become invalid in fact because the Chinese government had not sent directors to the railway for eighteen months, and that the Chinese government had no right to exercise its functions on the railway. Therefore, the sale of the railway by Soviet Russia was legally and morally flawless. Our diplomatic community is extremely indignant about this. Litvinov's declaration and Karakhan's reply were only one day apart, but they were completely contradictory, showing that Soviet Russia's diplomacy is completely untrustworthy. Moreover, Soviet Russia wants to sell the railway, but is shifting the responsibility to our country. Its viciousness is evident. It is truly unfortunate that this action by the Soviet government has occurred at the beginning of the resumption of relations between China and Russia. It is difficult to predict what kind of impact this will have on the diplomacy of the two countries. It is reported that our government will lodge a strong protest on this matter. Furthermore, according to diplomatic circles, although Soviet Russia has clearly indicated that it wants to sell the Eastern Railway, there is still no concrete agreement between Japan, Russia, and the puppet regime on this matter. Although Soviet Russia wants to avoid conflict with Japan as much as possible, and the cunning Japanese are hesitant and satisfied with gaining the railway, it is feared that they will not be able to buy it so smoothly. Therefore, Japan will still remain behind the scenes, and the puppet organization in the Northeast will come forward to cause trouble with Russia in order to achieve its goal of forcibly occupying it.

After the railway changes hands, there will be new developments, the importance of which is no less than the development after the opening of this railway in 1896. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>The Harbin English Newspaper is Sealed</h3>
<p>(Harbin) The police department here has received orders from the Changchun "Manchukuo" Ministry of Foreign Affairs to seal up the printing press and editorial office of the Harbin Daily, which is run by the British, because the newspaper's reporter Simpson published anti-Manchu and pro-communist writings in the newspaper. The "Manchukuo" authorities also notified the British Consul-General Gastin, saying that if Simpson does not leave the country voluntarily within a week, he will be deported. The British Consul-General has reported this matter to the British Ambassador to China Lampson, and is now awaiting instructions from Peiping. Public opinion is that the actions of the "Manchu" authorities are an infringement of British jurisdiction. In addition, the "Manchukuo" political police have arrested three Russian staff members of the Harbin Daily and may send them to Russia. (Reuters, 12th)</p>

<h3>Japanese Representative Ishii Passes Through Honolulu</h3>
<h3>Singing the Praises of the East Asian Monroe Doctrine</h3>
<p>Saying Japan is at War for Peaceful Development</p>
<p>If the United States Recklessly Interferes, They Will Not Hesitate to Go to War</p>
<p>Honolulu: Japanese representative Viscount Ishii, who will attend the Washington Conference, passed through here today, delicately suggesting to local people that the United States should not interfere in Japan's Asian plans, and saying that Japan's military actions in Manchuria are part of a peaceful development plan, which immediately caused surprise and discussion among the people of the island. When reporters met with Ishii, they first asked him to explain what he called the Far East Monroe Doctrine. Ishii replied that Japan's general policy in the Far East could not be explained in a short time, and that the words about the Monroe Doctrine were also misinterpretations. He then spoke at length about Japan's determination to develop peacefully in Asia, saying that his previous explanation of the issue had been clearly misunderstood, leading to the talk of the Monroe Doctrine. He also said, "I dare say that there is very little possibility of war between the United States and Japan. Only two things are enough to create a situation that would lead to war: one is if Japan foolishly interferes in the affairs of the Western Hemisphere, and the other is if the United States interferes in Japan's peaceful development in Asia." A reporter immediately questioned whether Japan's actions in Manchuria were also part of the development process. Ishii replied that Japan's necessary actions in Manchuria were also part of the development process. At this time, military actions and other events undertaken by Japan are phenomena that occur simultaneously with the establishment of a new state, in order to protect the rights of the new state and Japan's interests. He further guaranteed that Japan has no intention of aggression or belligerence, but only wants to obtain the right to peaceful development without interference. However, Ishii did not specify a definite area where the so-called peaceful development of the Japanese will end, wanting the Americans to speculate for themselves. Finally, Ishii also said that Japan has many problems that are quite different from those encountered by Western countries, but at the moment, all parties must make some concessions in order to restore economic stability, although he believes that the economic conference will be successful.

<p>Reuters, Geneva, 12th - Henderson's compromise plan to save the disarmament conference from deadlock has been accepted by representatives of the five major powers. If it is approved by the General Committee on Monday, the deadlock can be eased. However, British and German opinions are still not close, but the scope of Germany's demands can be revealed to the world.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 12th - Henderson, Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, made efforts today to reconcile British and German opinions. It is reported that a compromise plan has been devised, and the General Committee will be convened on the 15th of this month to discuss both troop strength and material disarmament issues. It is reported that this plan can be accepted by the German representative Nadolny. It will be submitted to the core group tomorrow. Whether it can gain majority approval is still in doubt.</p>
<h3>Five-Power Meeting Fails Again</h3>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 12th - The second meeting of the five powers to discuss the disarmament conference deadlock failed again last night. There is still no understanding on the procedures to be adopted. Representatives of the five powers will report to the core committee today. The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference will probably consider the situation when it meets on Saturday and Sunday.</p>
<p>Reuters, Geneva, 11th - The Disarmament Conference is now certainly on the verge of crisis. Although the British representative Eden and the German representative Nadolny have held private talks repeatedly since the disarmament conference reached a deadlock three days ago, they have ultimately failed to reach any understanding. The German Foreign Minister's shocking statement that if the disarmament conference fails, Germany will rearm has further widened the rift in Geneva. The five powers met this afternoon, chaired by Henderson. The British representative Eden reported on the failure of the negotiations. The five powers will meet again tonight to continue discussions, but it is generally expected that a final plan will not be found.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 11th - In recent days, the British representative has repeatedly held talks with the German representative Nadolny on the issue of European military system unification. Today, representatives from the United States, Italy, and France held a meeting from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM, chaired by Henderson. He talked with the British representative Eden and the German representative Nadolny one after another. The British representative reported the situation of his contact with Nadolny to the representatives of the three countries, saying that although several consultations had been held, no results had been achieved, and he was very sorry. Nadolny told the representatives that although he seemed to accept the European military system unification plan in pure theory, the various reservations and unacceptable conditions put forward by the United Kingdom were in fact equivalent to a rejection. Therefore, what is currently being discussed is what path should be taken after the disarmament conference. Representatives of the major countries believe that since the situation is already like this, the situation should be submitted to the Presidium and the General Committee successively for clear discussion in order to accurately prove the differences of opinion and determine the responsibilities to be borne by the German government. The representatives of Britain and France are especially advocating this. The representatives will reconvene at 9:00 PM to conclude the talks. It is estimated that the representatives will advocate convening the Presidium of the Disarmament Conference tomorrow afternoon and the General Committee on Saturday to determine the fate of the Disarmament Conference.</p>
<h3>German Foreign Minister's Strong Tone</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 11th - The German Leipzig Newspaper published an article today by German Foreign Minister Neurath, predicting the failure of the disarmament conference. At that time, the German government will rearm. The article stated that discussions in Geneva have been going on for fifteen months, but the result has shown that Germany's demand for military equality has not been achieved. The reason is that countries with substantial armaments have no sincerity in disarmament. The general arms limitation or reduction within the scope of the British plan, no matter what its form, and even if such a reduction is made, it still forces Germany to supplement its armaments. Although the British plan is welcome as a practical effort towards a practical solution, it is not satisfactory to Germany in terms of the details of implementing or recognizing Germany's demand for equality. Therefore, the British plan still needs to be modified on these two points.</p>
<h3>British Secretary of State for War Sharply Criticizes</h3>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - Secretary of State for War Hailsham said in the House of Lords today regarding the disarmament issue that if Germany is unwilling to participate in the discussion of the British proposal or withdraw from the disarmament conference, then Germany is directly rejecting the implementation of the promised proposals and will bear the responsibility for the failure of disarmament. He hopes that Germany will adopt a more reasonable attitude. Even if Germany does not want to change its attitude, it may not necessarily withdraw from the disarmament conference. However, if Germany actually withdraws from the disarmament conference, what path will other countries take? This is truly an event worthy of the most serious consideration. In his personal opinion, the legal result will be that Germany must be bound by the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles. Any act of rearmament is an act of undermining the treaty and will bring the punitive clauses contained in the treaty into effect. If Germany withdraws from the disarmament conference and declares that it does not want to be bound by the Treaty of Versailles, then he believes that Germany's neighbors may not recognize Germany's behavior as satisfactory and be able to agree to a greatly reduced disarmament method.</p>
<h3>French Foreign Ministry Maintains Calm</h3>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 11th - Tonight's newspapers published in large characters the German Foreign Minister Neurath's statement that if the disarmament conference fails, Germany will rearm, but the French Foreign Ministry remains calm, saying that the German Foreign Minister's paper is only another demonstration by Germany.</p>
<p>Havas, Lyon, 11th - Former Prime Minister Herriot declared that he would explain the outline of the foreign policy of the Radical Socialist Party (i.e., the current government party) at an appropriate time. He also said that British Prime Minister MacDonald recently declared in the House of Commons, "The US government is prepared to assist Europe in maintaining security. If the disarmament conference can achieve concrete results, the United States can participate in a consultation treaty, so that countries feeling the danger of war can increase security."</p>
<p>He expressed great pleasure at MacDonald's statement that the United States can participate in international actions to maintain security, which is extremely important. From MacDonald's words, it can be seen that Britain has already understood this.</p>
<p>Havas, Geneva, 12th - Czech Foreign Minister Benes arrived here this morning.</p>
<p>Havas, Romanian Capital, 12th - Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu departed last night to Geneva to participate in the work of the Disarmament Conference and to prepare for the convening of the Standing Political Conference of the Little Entente countries.</p>
<p>The World Does Not Welcome</p>
<h3>Hitler's Representative</h3>
<p>British Demand Rosenburg's Expulsion</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - During questioning in the House of Commons today, several Labour Party members asked Home Secretary Gilmour to instruct Rosenburg, the representative of the German National Socialist Party, to pack up and return home. Opposition leader Lansbury claimed that the government's treatment of Fascist and Communist propagandists was very different. Gilmour later replied that if Mr. Rosenburg took any actions that violated British interests, he would be ordered to leave the country. Lansbury then asked the Speaker to allow him to move for adjournment of the meeting in order to discuss the admission of German Fascist propagandists. Lansbury also said that the teaching of Fascism is aimed at overthrowing the British Parliament and Constitution. Lansbury's motion was rejected by the Speaker.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 11th - Rosenburg, the representative of German Chancellor Hitler, is currently in London. He hosted British journalists at a hotel tonight, but during the reception, there was a Communist demonstration outside the hotel. The Communists gathered outside the door, shouting "Expel Rosenburg," and then clashed with the police. As a result, two people were arrested. Rosenburg made a brief statement to the journalists, saying that the purpose of the German revolution was to restore social peace. He did not want to apologize for the events that had occurred in Germany. As for the foreign accusations against Germany for detaining political prisoners, it must be known that the freedom of 65 million Germans is more valuable than the freedom of a few Communists. The German government will henceforth pay more attention to the interests of German workers than before. The National Socialist Party has died 300 people and injured 20,000 people in the past 14 years. The number of deaths and injuries is far greater than the number of people currently detained in Germany. As for the atrocities against Jews, they are countable and not very many.</p>
<p>Havas, Vienna, 12th - As the date of the visit to Austria by several German cabinet members is approaching, an announcement has been issued before their departure, saying that if Austria takes any discriminatory actions against German cabinet members, Berlin will regard this attitude as being directed at the German government and its leaders. The people of the Austrian capital are therefore extremely disturbed. The police department has decided that no more than 20 people from the National Socialist Party may go to welcome the German cabinet members when they arrive. The welcome ceremony for the National Socialist Party is limited to only one occasion.</p>
<p>National News, Vienna, 11th - The German cabinet members will arrive at the Vienna airport at 2:30 PM on Saturday and will then take cars through the city. Several Austrian newspapers have expressed their disgust for the German Socialist Party this week, but the Austrian Socialist Party expects the people of the Austrian capital to give the German cabinet members a warm welcome.</p>

<h3>German to Implement Equal Land Rights</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 12th. The National Socialist Party today proposed a bill, intending to start with the state of Prussia, to distribute land to farmers, and then gradually promote it throughout the country. According to the initiators of this bill, since German farmers were freed from the bonds of the Napoleonic Wars, this is the most important change in German law. The bill stipulates that farmland will be divided into several squares, each limited to the amount of land that a farming family can cultivate, and free sale is prohibited. Those who own this land are only allowed one son to inherit it. This farmer must be of Germanic blood, neither Jewish nor of a colored race. If this farmer marries a non-Germanic person, their descendants will lose the right to inherit the property.</p>
<p>Japanese Troops Advance Again, Occupying Luan Dong, Threatening Beiping and Tianjin (Reached)</p>
<p>Plotting to Cross the River and Invade Westward After Occupying Changli and Qian’an</p>
<p>Bombing Miyun, Ji County, and Yutian, Disturbing Our Rear</p>
<p>Wan Fulin, He Zhuguo, and Others All Arrive in Beiping to Confer</p>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: The Japanese army's ambitions are unpredictable. On one hand, they are sending personnel to collude with traitors in Tianjin, plotting disturbances. On the other hand, they are mobilizing large armies for a large-scale invasion. The eastern route is invading Luan Dong again, and the northern route is attacking south from the important passes of the Great Wall at Xifengkou and Gubeikou, threatening Beiping and Tianjin. The western route is mobilizing troops to invade Chahar, attacking our defenses, attempting to complete the conspiracy of making North China a state in the shortest possible time. At the very least, they intend to break through our important military bases in North China before the green crops rise, preventing us from counterattacking. This is because the weather is gradually getting hotter, and vegetation is flourishing. Soon, the green crops will rise. If the Japanese army does not take this opportunity to wreak havoc and actively oppress us to submit to their violence, then it will be particularly difficult militarily later on. In order to quickly realize their conspiracy, the Japanese army has already spent heavily in Tianjin to buy off traitors and organize various group armies as internal and external collaborators. They are also using the excuse of our army entering Luan Dong to launch a large-scale offensive, carrying out a general attack on the evening of the 7th. One route advanced from Jianchangying to Qian'an, one route attacked Funing from Jielingkou, and one route advanced westward along the Pingyu Avenue, flanking our garrison on the Beining Line. At the same time, the Japanese army's Luhe unit on the Beining front led armored car formations to pressure our army. Since the Japanese army withdrew from Lulong, Qian'an, Funing, and Changli in Luan Dong last month, in order to maintain local order, a part of Wang Yizhe's army entered Lulong and Qian'an to maintain law and order. On the Beining Line, only He Zhuguo's cavalry regiment of a thousand men, with armored cars named Henan, Huguang, etc., patrolled the line to maintain transportation. The troops at the front were not very numerous. On the Jielingkou front, the enemy attacked Funing from the Zhangjiamafang area on the 7th, engaging our few troops. In order to ensure the safety of our right flank, our army withdrew to the highlands north and southeast of Lulong on the night of the 7th. On the Qian'an front, the enemy attacked from Jianchangying, and clashes occurred near Qian'an and the Lujialuotun area. At the same time, multiple enemy aircraft flew over Qian'an, dropping bombs back and forth. At dawn on the 8th, the enemy army attacked Qian'an in multiple directions, with artillery and aircraft bombing the city, dropping more than 500 shells. Fires broke out in the city, and the northeast corner of the city was also destroyed. There were many casualties among soldiers and civilians. After fierce fighting until yesterday, our army withdrew westward from Qian'an. On the Lulong front, after Funing, Qian'an, and other places fell, the enemy concentrated its forces to attack Lulong. Yesterday, there were clashes in various places northeast, east, and southeast of the county seat. Our army had few troops in Lulong, and there was no defensible terrain, so they also withdrew west of the Luan River at night, holding the original position west of the Luan River. On the Beining Line, the Japanese army began to pressure us on the 7th, flanking along the Pingyu Avenue and advancing westward along the railway with armored cars. On the 7th, they advanced to Danashi, southwest of Qinhuangdao, and had minor contact with our army. On the 8th, they advanced to Beidaihe Liushouying. Yesterday morning (9th), they attacked our line 20 li east of Changli again. Our armored cars were on alert between Zhangzhuang and Liushouying. North of Changli, the enemy advanced along the Pingyu Avenue, also reaching a point more than 20 li from Changli. The enemy who occupied Lulong last night crossed the Qinglong River this morning (10th) and continued to pressure the troops on the east bank of the Luan River. Changli was surrounded by the enemy last night. Our army left only a few cavalry in Luan Dong, and most of them had crossed the river, still holding the original position west of the Luan River last month for operational convenience, confronting the enemy. In order to intimidate our rear, the Japanese army sent multiple aircraft to Yutian, Fengrun, and Shaheyi yesterday to drop bombs, causing considerable losses to the residents. Starting at dawn this morning, two enemy aircraft bombed Miyun three times, and then another aircraft came and dropped several bombs, causing heavy losses to merchants and civilians. This morning, four aircraft also went to Ji County and dropped six bombs, killing more than ten people. At the same time, aircraft also went to Bijia Mountain, Jiuzhong Mountain, and other places to drop bombs. In recent days, the enemy troops in Gubeikou and Xifengkou have greatly increased, showing signs of further attacks. Yesterday, on the Nantianmen front, an enemy aircraft repeatedly reconnoitered our Xinkailing position, dropping bombs three times. This afternoon, more than a hundred enemy cavalry and a battalion of infantry moved towards Heilongtan. The situation in that area is gradually becoming tense again.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Eastern military emergency, the Japanese side initially warned us, using the excuse of our army entering Luan Dong, seemingly taking the form of negotiations. Later, because our side could not accept their unreasonable demands, the war broke out. He Zhuguo came to Beiping twice to request instructions on how to deal with Luan Dong. This morning, Wan Fulin also rushed back from the front to confer. This afternoon, Wan, He, Fu, Shang, and other senior generals all went to Jurentang to confer with Ke Yingqin on Luan Dong and defense plans for all routes. The content is extremely important. In order to consolidate the front line, our army still abandons Luan Dong and retreats to defend Luan Xi. If the Japanese army crosses the river again and advances westward, our army will fight to the death, regardless of success or failure. The attitude of the generals is unusually firm, and the morale of the troops at the front is also very high.</p>
<p>He Yingqin told foreign reporters last night that the Japanese army, using the excuse of our army entering Luan Dong, launched a large-scale invasion and expanded the scope. All responsibility should be borne by the Japanese side. When the Japanese army withdrew last month, a part of our Wang Yizhe's army entered Lulong, Funing, Qian'an, and other places to maintain order, and only a thousand cavalry from He Zhuguo's unit patrolled the Beining Line to maintain transportation. There were no other actions. The Japanese side is actually using this as an excuse, and their deception is evident. (May 10th)</p>
<h3>The Overwhelming Military Pressure on Guyuan (Continued)</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Guo An</p>
<p>(3) County Magistrate Cai Complains Endlessly</p>
<p>After coming out of the military headquarters, I went to the county government again and sat in County Magistrate Cai Qingchan's office. In an atmosphere of sorrow, County Magistrate Cai Qingchan sometimes frowned tightly and sometimes forced a wry smile, very sincerely revealing the suffering of the people of Guyuan County from their inability to make a living.</p>
<p>The Fifth Team of the Red Swastika Society Treats Wounded Civilians at the Temporary Treatment Center in Qian'an</p>
<p>"Guyuan was established as a county in the fifth year of the Republic of China. On August 4th of that year, it moved from the original county seat of Dushikou to Guyuan. The construction of the county seat began in the fourteenth year and was completed in the sixteenth year. The shape of Guyuan is narrow and long because of the division by the Great Wall. It is about forty li wide from east to west and four hundred li long from north to south. It borders Duolun to the northeast, Baochang to the northwest, Zhangbei County to the west, Chicheng and Yanqing to the southwest, Huairou and Miyun to the southwest, Luanping to the southeast, and Fengning to the east.</p>
<p>The land tax in Guyuan is very light. The regular tax and surtax average only about six yuan per mu. The total amount of cultivated land in the county is nearly 10,000 qing (one qing is about ten mu), and the treasury has 27,000 yuan. The annual collection of land tax can yield about 80%. The monthly administrative expenses are more than 690 yuan, the judicial expenses are about 300 yuan, and the four bureaus and various schools require a total of 3,500 yuan. In addition, the local police and security forces need 3,000 yuan per month, and temporary expenses also amount to about 1,000 yuan per month. However, since last year, the Maintenance Committee has been established to supply provisions to the troops, and all expenses have been increasing day by day. (The Maintenance Committee is managed locally, with expenses distributed throughout the county according to land area.)</p>
<p>The county has more than 15,000 households, with a population of 100,000 men, women, and children. Most of them migrated from Shanxi, Shandong, and Hebei provinces, and there are very few natives. Mongol banner people account for only one or two percent. About 90% of the people are engaged in agriculture, and very few are engaged in industry and commerce. As for literacy, it goes without saying. Speaking of education in this county, there are only three complete primary schools and one normal training institute. The backwardness of culture can be imagined.</p>
<p>There are no large businesses on the county street. There are only a dozen or so small stalls and shops in the city. The main agricultural product in the first and second districts is naked oats, with some wheat, and other crops such as sesame seeds, rapeseed, buckwheat, and peas. There are also sheepskin, wool, fox fur, and medicinal materials such as red peony root, Scutellaria baicalensis, Saposhnikovia divaricata, Plantago asiatica, Astragalus propinquus, Strychnos nux-vomica, Anemarrhena asphodeloides, Atractylodes lancea, and Glycyrrhiza uralensis. The third and fourth districts have relatively more agricultural products, including wheat, sorghum, soybeans, millet, rice, silkworm silk, honey, and almonds, but they are all underdeveloped. The third and fourth districts are mostly mountainous and suitable for planting trees and fruit trees, but unfortunately, there is no management. This is the general situation of this county. The current situation is even more unbearable. This county has always been famous for its poverty. Since the fifteenth year, it has suffered successive droughts, and bandits are everywhere. In the twentieth and twenty-first years, although the harvests were not bad, the low grain prices hurt the farmers, and the poverty of the locality was not solved at all. Naked oats are the main crop in this county, and the price is the cheapest, selling for only 1.8 yuan per stone, so the quality of the year does not make much of a difference. The income of the people depends entirely on the pastureland, because this county is a natural pastureland. Animal husbandry is a sideline for the people, and every household is like this. Every large household has thousands or tens of thousands of cattle, sheep, donkeys, and horses, and even small households have dozens or hundreds of heads. However, recently, the bandits have been too rampant, and there are no regular troops stationed to suppress them. The local security police cannot provide adequate protection, so the livestock of the people are robbed by the bandits. Therefore, the people dare not engage in animal husbandry anymore. In this way, large households decline, and small households become so poor that they have nothing to eat. Recently, with the increase in taxes and the heavy burden of requisitions, how can the people survive?</p>
<p>You think, the finances of this county are now, needless to say, bankrupt. I have exhausted all methods and means, but it is useless. In the past, after the bandits left, the soldiers came. The people, after escaping, could hardly settle down. The local income relied on the surtax on land tax. Besides that, it was requisitions. The people cannot even afford the regular tax, how can they manage the requisitions? Moreover, with the troops passing through, requisitioning carts, this county was assigned thirty three-horse carts. Because the locality does not have such large carts, it was changed to a requisition from the people to purchase them, with each cart costing 300 yuan, which, together with the delivery fee, would amount to about 10,000 yuan. This county sent twelve carts and was already exhausted. The total number of troops passing through, both before and after, was about 50,000 or 60,000. Some were stationed for two or three days and then left, and some arrived and left immediately. However, the loss from the requisition of vehicles and the provision of supplies for the people</p>
<p>was no less than 20,000 or 30,000. The first and third districts are full of supplies for the troops, but no payment has been given yet. In this way, how can a poor Guyuan County like ours bear it?</p>
<p>The Fifth Team of the Red Swastika Society Provides Relief After the Bombing of Qian'an City by Aircraft</p>
<p>The most important thing is spring plowing. If spring plowing is delayed, the people will all starve to death. But now, wanting to do spring plowing, most of the plowing cattle in every household have been robbed by the bandits. Moreover, with the overwhelming military pressure, there is no seed grain left. How can this difficult problem be solved? Sir, please think of a way for this county. The supply of provisions to the troops in the locality has been going on for three months. The grain stocks are not much left. There are still 20,000 troops from the Tang army and more than 10,000 righteous soldiers stationed in the territory. If this stalemate continues, I am afraid that in less than half a month, both the soldiers and the people will starve." As he said this, he looked like he was about to cry. As I was recording, I asked him if he had any solutions. He frowned again and said, "If there is money, there is a solution. The important problem at the moment is that we must solve the spring plowing, but there are no plowing cattle and no seed grain. What can we do? It would be best if we could approve a relief fund of more than 10,000 yuan, and we could maintain it for the time being."</p>
<p>In this sad mood, I managed to record a complaint-filled account for Guyuan County. But, dear readers, in such a poor situation, can we still resist the enemy and win? Well, friends, wait and see the article "A General Account of the Battle of Chahar." Although you are squatting by that distant and beautiful river, I believe you will have a clear and clear picture of the battle of Chahar. (8th, in Zhangyuan)</p>
<h3>A General Account of the Battle of Chahar (Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Guo An)</h3>
<p>(1) A Declaration</p>
<p>The current situation in North China is what ordinary people are concerned about. Of course, under the enemy's fierce artillery fire, who can determine what the outcome will be? Except for those friends who are holding guns, squatting in the trenches day and night, waiting for bombs and shells to arrive, the rest of the people in the rear, who is not opening the newspaper (of course, those who don't read are the exception), shaking their heads, and frowning as they curse? In this chaotic and unclear environment, should we, the comrades and compatriots who are not holding guns, show weakness, or should we "take your gun and rush to the front"? Friends, let's look north for a glance.</p>
<p>The war clouds of Luan Dong are moving sometimes tightly and sometimes slowly, but half of the sky on the northwest corner is being shaken by the enemy's exploding bombs. Aren't we, the compatriots like ants on a hot pot, worried again this week about the sky shaking and about to fall in the northwest corner? Duolun was in a fierce hand-to-hand battle, and finally, due to insufficient reinforcements, it changed to a new position. So, will Guyuan, Zhangbei County, and Zhangjiakou, the transportation line between China and Russia, also suffer the same trampling by the enemy? I am a weak guy squatting behind the gun, holding a pen, so in this half of the big sky on the northwest corner, shouldn't I report as much as possible to the readers about the shaking and firmness of the battle line on the northwest corner, and about small problems related to strategy? Therefore, with a heart full of emotion, I wrote this personal report, but everything in it is the true situation that I heard and saw. So, when readers see this fragmented and unsystematic report, what kind of feeling should they have in their hearts?</p>
<p>(2) The Street Battle of Duolun</p>
<p>Duolun, under the command of Zhao Chengshou's two thousand cavalry, and at the same time under the attack of the Liu Guitang rebel army commanded by the Japanese Kojitsu, and five hundred Japanese cavalry, was abandoned due to insufficient reinforcements. That day (29th), the wind howled furiously, and the enemy's aircraft did not arrive, but the most tragic and cruel street battle took place in the ancient city of Duolun. An old soldier, drunk, said very carelessly,</p>
<p>"We were doing things locally and saw that we couldn't hold on anymore. The defense团 (regiment) in the city gathered rioters and set fires everywhere to attack the guard team of our military headquarters. They probably did this because we had confiscated their weapons, a total of five or six hundred guns, and sent them to our hands. Who knew that these guys would find a lot of guns and fight us. This barrage of artillery, guns, and fire was even more urgent than the front line. Who could resist it? Like a tide, we retreated downwards. On this flat sandy plain, when the cavalry got on their horses, who cared about resisting? At this time, whoever ran fast was the hero. This cavalry force, like a puff of smoke, retreated from different battle lines in Duolun, simply abandoning everything. They ran smoking southwest along the Zhangduo Avenue to Zhangbei County, but near Daliangdi, they gathered for a while, but the dark night made it impossible to gather completely. Fortunately, after the enemy entered Duolun, they did not pursue. The rebel army, who wanted both money and women, reportedly caused the people to cry out when they entered the city. When we arrived in Zhangbei County, it happened that the Jin army originally stationed in Zhangbei had been transferred to the east. The trenches in the north of Zhangbei were very well constructed. If the Liu Guitang rebel army wants to attack again, they will really have to fight him hard. Who cares if he is Chinese or not?" The old soldier said, with saliva flying from his mouth. I couldn't help but have this kind of thought in my heart: "Was the reason for withdrawing from Duolun because they were all Chinese and couldn't bear to kill each other?" (To be continued)</p>
<p>Chen Mingshu Returns to China</p>
<h3>Chen Jitang Welcomes Chen Back to Guangdong to Discuss Major Plans Together</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Former Chairman of Guangdong Province and Minister of Transportation Chen Mingshu recently returned to China from Europe. On the sixth of this month, he arrived in Hong Kong on the Italian mail ship "Conte Verde". Those from the Guangdong provincial military and political circles who went to Hong Kong to welcome him included Second Army Commander Xiang Hanping, President of the Provincial Bank Shen Zaihe, 19th Route Army Commander Cai Tingkai, and 19th Route Army Generals Tan Qixiu and Zhang Yan, etc. After Chen arrived in Hong Kong, he stayed at Ouyang Ju's residence that evening. Relatives and old friends visited in an endless stream. After Chen met with Xiang Hanping, the representative of the Guangdong authorities, he agreed to come to the province the next day to discuss important political matters with Chen Jitang, the Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group. Therefore, at 3:00 PM on the 7th, he, along with Xiang Hanping, Cai Tingkai, Tan Qixiu, Ouyang Ju, Shen Zaihe, Yang Jianping, and Mrs. Chen, Zhu Guangzhen, and others, a group of more than ten people, took a special train on the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway and arrived in the port at 7:30 PM that afternoon. Military and political authorities here and personnel from the rear office of the 19th Route Army all welcomed him at the Dashatou Station. The arrangement of military police and detectives was unusually tight. Chen was wearing an apricot gray wool suit that day, and his spirit was better than when he was in Guangdong before. At the station, he exchanged greetings with the welcomers and then took a car with Cai Tingkai and Xiang Hanping back to his private residence in Dongshan Fangyuan. After a short rest, he went with Cai and Xiang to the Model Village to meet Chen Jitang. The two Chens talked happily when they met. In the evening, Chen Jitang hosted a banquet for Chen in the foreign flower hall of the provincial government, with senior military officers of the First Army Group and members and directors of the provincial government in attendance. During the banquet, Chen Jitang stood up and gave a speech, fully expressing his welcome. Chen also stood up and gave a reply speech. It was not until after 10:00 PM that they dispersed in joy. According to Chen's conversation, this return to Guangdong was at the invitation of Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang to discuss everything and to see old friends in Guangdong. He will stay for a few days and then decide where to go. Regarding the situation, his proposition is that resisting Japan and saving the country is his long-cherished ambition. The 19th Route Army bears the national mission, and continuing to resist Japan is its duty. Although a part has been transferred to depart, if necessary, all of them can be transferred to the north. In short, the 19th Route Army's spirit of resolutely saving the country will never change, and the will of the entire army is like this. His own proposition is also like this, etc. (May 7th)</p>
<p>The Reason for Wu Peifu's Disbanding of His Guards (Leads)</p>
<h3>Sending His Subordinates Back to Their Hometowns Due to Economic Hardship</h3>
<p>Special dispatch from Beiping: Wu Peifu is living in seclusion in the old capital, studying Buddhism every day, and his attitude is quite passive. There are still 1,500 of his former guards who did not leave with Wu. Wu's monthly expenses in Beiping require more than 10,000 yuan. When Zhang Xueliang was in Beiping, Zhang personally gave 4,000 yuan per month, but Wu's expenses were huge, and income could not meet expenditure. He had to borrow from here and there, and he could not make ends meet. He felt extremely financially embarrassed. Recently, after being persuaded by friends, and at the same time, in order to save expenses, he decided to send his guards back to their hometowns. The day before yesterday (8th), Wu gathered the officers of his former subordinates in Shijin Garden and told them of his difficulties in sending them away. Most of his subordinates expressed their unwillingness to leave Wu. Later, after the local military and police smoothed things over, Wu's officers and soldiers agreed to hand over their weapons first. On the spot, they handed over seven rifles, 121 carbines, 3,265 rounds of ammunition, 281 hand grenades, 226 broadswords, and many scattered weapons. Fan Naiwu, the commander of the Beiping Gendarmerie, and Ma Qingyu, the captain of the Public Security Bureau's Special Affairs Team, checked and received everything one by one and sent twenty gendarmes and policemen to take care of Wu's residence and the guard headquarters of the Princess Mansion. The confiscated weapons were sent to the Gendarmerie Headquarters for safekeeping yesterday afternoon (9th). After the news of Wu's disbanding of his guards spread, the guards had a slight misunderstanding with Wu's chief of staff, Zhang Fangyan, and a dispute occurred. Zhang was slightly injured as a result. After mediation, the officers and soldiers agreed to be sent away, but they requested Wu to issue a commemorative badge to each person as a souvenir of their return to their fields in the future. Wu also felt that his subordinates had been with the army for many years and had worked hard, so he agreed. Currently, the jewelry store is stepping up the production, preparing to issue them, and it is also decided to issue each officer a severance payment of 30 yuan and each soldier 15 yuan. This expense was borne by friends from all sides, and everyone has already received it. Among his former subordinates, people from the three provinces of Zhili, Shandong, and Henan are the most numerous, and there are also about 300 people from Sichuan and Hunan. After the authorities contacted the railway bureau, they were allowed to ride the train for free, and it was agreed that the repatriation would be implemented today and tomorrow. This morning, the reporter went to Shijin Garden to pay his respects to Wu. He was received by Mr. Xu Tiefeng, who said that Wu's attitude was the same as before. The previous time he came to Beiping at the invitation of Zhang Xueliang was to jointly plan to resist Japan and defend against insults. At present, the central government has an overall plan to resist Japan, and Wu himself can contribute everything in his capacity as a commoner. The guard team was decided to be disbanded due to insufficient funds. From now on, Wu will live in Beiping as a commoner to recuperate and will never go anywhere else. If Wu is needed for anti-Japanese affairs, he will definitely serve the country, going through fire and water. As for the frank attitude of not living in the concession and not relying on foreigners, he will never change his original intention. At the same time, because Wu had been in power for a long time, and his former subordinates were all over the north and south, it is inevitable that some people would borrow his name, and he could not recognize them. It is heard that Wu's current living expenses in Beiping, after Zhang Xueliang left Beiping, are still paid by Chairman Jiang Jun at the rate of 4,000 gold per month to maintain the status quo.

<h3>Reasons for the Accusation Against the Magistrate of Rugao County, Songjiang</h3>
<p>Qian Zuoyi, a native of the county, was appointed as the magistrate of Rugao County in the past. He assumed office during a time of rampant banditry, which was soon quelled. This time, he was suspended from his duties and transferred to the Zhenjiang Court Prosecutor's Office for investigation. A reporter inquired about the matter, and Magistrate Qian stated that the case was referred to the Civil Service Disciplinary Committee for investigation. He presented the original text of the Civil Service Disciplinary Committee's review, as well as a factual account of the events. According to Qian, after he took office, the 25th Army's Liang Guanying's unit was about to depart for Anhui and directly demanded 80,000 yuan in military pay from the Rugao County government. Magistrate Qian then sought instructions from the provincial government and convened a meeting of gentry and merchants, deciding to borrow from wealthy merchants. He dispatched personnel to expedite the matter at the land registry office. Subsequently, the office reported that Lu Huai's father, Lu Xiaotang, had assets of over 100,000 yuan and suggested borrowing 500 yuan. Lu Huai happened to return to Rugao from school in Shanghai and suddenly went back on his word, only paying 150 yuan. Despite repeated urging, he refused to pay the remaining amount. A report was submitted to the county government, and the head of the first section, Zhou Rongdai, was dispatched to diligently persuade him, but he still refused to pay. An order was issued for him to provide a guarantor and a deadline for payment, but he was not detained. Lu Huai appealed to the Provincial Department of Civil Affairs, which ruled that he should pay 300 yuan. Lu remained dissatisfied and is now appealing to the provincial government, which has not yet been resolved. In the Civil Service Disciplinary Committee's review document, the point of Lu Huai's father providing a guarantor and a deadline for payment was considered evidence of detention. It was argued that if there were no detention, there would be no need for a guarantor. The accused was considered to have admitted that the matter was true. Therefore, a letter was sent to the provincial government to suspend him from his duties and to conduct an investigation in court. Qian has now gone to the province to surrender himself for interrogation and requested access to the original files to clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Open-Air Assassination Case in Taicang</h3>
<p>In the open-air temple area of the seventh district of the county, a villager named Pu A'quan, who worked as a farmer, was found dead. His father had passed away early, and his mother had remarried. He had a wife, but although she was not chaste, the couple's relationship was relatively harmonious. On the morning of the sixth of this month, Pu's wife went out to buy vegetables, and A'quan was alone at home. When his wife returned, she suddenly saw A'quan lying in a pool of blood, already dead. The murderer had fled without a trace. Upon closer examination of the body, five knife wounds were discovered, all in vital areas. However, after the incident, the deceased's family and the township head, Pu Jifu, and the local security officer, Pu Shaolin, all concealed the matter from the county government. Now, Wan Baocai, the head of the county's detective team, has heard the news and has dispatched Officer Zhu to secretly investigate and clarify the truth.</p>
<h3>Large Gang of Lake Bandits Discovered in Taihu Lake, Suzhou</h3>
<p>Recently, lake bandits in the Suzhou area have become rampant, and robbery cases are frequent. The night before last, a bandit boat carrying more than ten bandits was discovered near the Midu Bridge outside the Fengmen Gate of Suzhou. After being pursued by the police, they escaped towards Huangtiandang. That same evening (the 11th) at 8:00 PM, the Xingji Cloth Store in the bustling market of Mudu Town was robbed, with losses exceeding 600 yuan. The bandits fled towards Lion Mountain. News has now arrived that yesterday (the 12th) at 11:00 AM, over twenty lake bandits were discovered in East Taihu Lake, and eighty lake bandits were also discovered in West Taihu Lake, all fully armed, with the intention of carrying out robberies. After receiving the report, the Third District of the Water Police immediately dispatched ten naval ships to pursue and suppress them. The police teams of Wujiang and Wuxian counties also dispatched teams to set out. At the same time, the county government ordered the land and water police teams stationed in the East and West Dongting Mountains to mobilize and encircle the bandits.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Land and Water Military Police Protect Cocoon Market</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Government, in view of the imminent arrival of the spring cocoon season, should prepare in advance for the protection of cocoon merchants and the collection of cocoons. A zoned protection plan has been drafted: (1) Songjiang, Shanghai, Fengxian, and Jinshan counties will be jointly responsible by the First District of the Water Police in coordination with the garrisoned army; (2) Wuxi, Wujin, Yixing, and part of Jiangyin counties, as well as the tombs inside the East, West, and South Mountains of Taihu Lake, will be jointly responsible by the Second District of the Water Police in coordination with the garrisoned army and patrol ships; (3) Changshu, Kunshan, Wuxian counties, and all areas along the Jiangsu-Zhejiang border will be jointly responsible by the Third District of the Water Police in coordination with the garrisoned army; (4) Nantong, Haimen, and the coastal areas of Changshu will be jointly responsible by the Fourth District of the Water Police in coordination with the army; (5) Zhenjiang, Danyang, Jiangning, Yangzhou, and part of Jiangyin will be jointly responsible by the Fifth District of the Water Police and the army; (6) The Provincial Public Security Team on Water, guerrillas, and patrol ships will patrol in their respective areas to supplement the police force; (7) The Department of Civil Affairs will assign the head of the Second District of the Water Police to organize an office in Wuxi, where sericulture is flourishing, to supervise and direct operations. In addition, protection measures will be formulated in accordance with precedents and then ordered to the Wuxi County Government and the Second District of the Water Police for compliance.</p>
<h3>Thorough Investigation of the Embezzlement of Stolen Goods by the Local Defense Corps</h3>
<p>The Local Defense Corps of the fifth district of the county seized two bandit boats near the Sanhao Bridge on the Xi-Cheng Road in the middle of last month, containing thirty-eight large pigs and sixty silver dollars. Afterwards, Yang Zuxun, the township head and head of the Local Defense Corps, slaughtered one pig to reward the troops and hid twenty-five others, only handing over twelve. The sixty silver dollars were also divided and spent by several members of the corps. The twenty-five large pigs that were embezzled were sold at a low price to the Tan Yaobing and Zou Ahe butcher shops for 30 yuan each, totaling over 700 yuan. Before long, the owner, Tang Rulin, learned of this, investigated the truth in the township, and requested the county government to investigate thoroughly. Yesterday, Magistrate Yan ordered the township head Yang Zuxun and the butcher shop owners Tan Yaobing and Zou Ahe to be brought to court for interrogation. After confirming the facts, they were detained pending punishment.</p>
<h3>Changzhou Court Searches Drug Trafficking Organization</h3>
<p>Yang Kongyi, the chief prosecutor of the Wujin County Court Prosecutor's Office, and others, led bailiffs and members of the merchant corps patrol team to search a drug trafficking organization at 55 Qingguo Lane at noon on the 11th. As a result, they found a signboard of the Xingji Company, account books, and other items. After the search, the county party headquarters immediately sent a letter to the county court, requesting that the house of the drug trafficking organization be sealed immediately, those responsible be arrested, and a telegram be sent to the provincial party headquarters for approval. A letter was also sent to the First District Public Office to find out the name of the owner of the house of the organization for verification.</p>
<h3>Jiangyin Security Commissioner Visits Cheng to Assess Performance</h3>
<p>Qiu Mingjiu, a performance assessment commissioner sent by the Provincial Security Committee, arrived in Cheng from Xi the day before yesterday (the 10th). Together with Magistrate Ruan, they discussed and decided to conduct regular examinations of the county's Local Defense Corps by district. Starting on the 11th, they, along with Magistrate Ruan and Police Captain Yin, set out to examine the corps members in each district.</p>
<h3>Manager of Tailai Company in Yangzhou Detained</h3>
<p>The Tailai Flour Company set up a station in Yangzhou to collect wheat. Because it failed to pay business tax, the Jiangdu Business Tax Bureau sent a letter to the county government, requesting that the manager of the station, Sheng Shanqing, be summoned to the county and be required to pay 920 yuan in business tax according to the business tax regulations. Sheng argued that the wheat flour had already been subject to a special tax, and wheat had long been exempted from taxes. Now, if a business tax is levied for setting up a station to collect wheat, it would be akin to double taxation. In addition to submitting a petition to the Ministry of Finance, he specially petitioned the county government for bail. After receiving the petition, Acting Magistrate Ma stated that the collection of this business tax was based on the request of the Business Tax Bureau. Since a petition had been submitted to the Ministry of Finance, the matter should be handled according to the Ministry's order. It was now instructed that until the Ministry's order was received, a guarantor and a pledge should be obtained and kept in the county for verification.</p>
<h3>Nantung Dasheng Factory Labor Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>The labor strike at the Tangzha Dasheng Yarn Factory, which had lasted for ten days, has now been resolved through mediation by party and government representatives. The factory resumed operations on the 12th. The county government issued a special notice stating: "The labor strike at the Dasheng Yarn Factory has been suppressed by order of this government, and officials have been sent to investigate. This time, the workers were exploited and went on strike without reason, disrupting local order and cutting off the livelihoods of fellow workers. This government, mindful of the difficulties of the times, will refrain from further investigation for the time being. The factory has now been persuaded to register and verify workers as soon as possible, and it has been ordered to resume operations on the 12th of this month. All male and female workers of the factory must work with peace of mind. If there are any evildoers who persist in their wickedness, obstruct and cause trouble, they will be severely arrested and dealt with according to the law."</p>
<h3>Yellow Spear Society in Hefei Opens Fire in Resistance to Opium Suppression</h3>
<p>The Yellow Spear Society in the northeastern third, fourth, and fifth district, due to Magistrate Wang leading a team into the countryside to forcibly suppress opium cultivation, gathered over a thousand people, announced their resistance. Magistrate Wang was unable to carry out the suppression at the Longhua Temple in Youfangji. Subsequently, the commander of the 55th Division, Ruan Zhaochang, dispatched the Zhao regiment and Liu battalion to suppress them. The Yellow Spear Society dared to attack the troops, wounding more than ten people. Fire was then opened, resulting in the deaths of dozens of members of the Yellow Spear Society, and the remaining members scattered. Magistrate Wang and Regiment Commander Zhao ordered that no further attacks be made, and they simultaneously advised the public and supervised the suppression of opium seedlings. However, there are rumors that the Spear Society in each district is still reorganizing to resist.</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Cables Chen to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Denies Sending Representatives South for Negotiations</p>
<p>Orders Detention of Impostors</p>
<p>Reports circulated that Executive Yuan President Wang Jingwei had sent representatives to Guangdong for negotiations. Wang officially denied this. According to reliable sources in this port, Wang cabled Chen Jitang yesterday: "I have read in the newspapers that my brother sent a representative, Wang Xiaoai, to the province. After investigation, I did not send this person, nor do I know who he is. If this person is impersonating a representative in the province, I hope you will detain and investigate him." - Wang Jingwei.</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying's Representative Hosted News Media Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reported on the Course of Sun's Army's Resistance Against Japan</p>
<p>Sun Dianying, commander of the 41st Army, recently sent Hu Jiesan, director of the Beiping Office, to Shanghai to report to all circles and receive treatment. Yesterday afternoon, he hosted the news media at Yizhi Xiang, where over fifty reporters from various newspapers attended. During the event, Hu Jiesan reported: "Comrades and brothers, I, Hu Jiesan, have been specially sent by General Sun Dianying to Shanghai to thank all circles for their support and the encouragement of the journalists. I have prepared a simple meal, and I am honored and pleased that you have all come here to discuss matters. During this resistance against Japan, our army was ordered to proceed to Chifeng. Due to the loss of Chengde, our army was suddenly surrounded. Since March 2nd, we have been under increasing pressure from the enemy. We were not only hungry and cold but also had no source of ammunition. After more than twenty days of bloodshed, we finally broke out of the encirclement on March 28th. The casualties among officers and soldiers amounted to several thousand. The details of the battle have been telegraphed to the authorities and disclosed in various newspapers, so you are already aware of them. Over the past month, various groups and comrades, both Chinese and foreign, have provided us with a large number of supplies, money, and ammunition. Our army is deeply grateful for this generosity. Our commander has instructed each department, saying that the only way our army can repay the party and the country is with blood and flesh. Today, I dare to represent all the officers and soldiers of our army with these words to express our gratitude to our compatriots and journalists. However, the work of resisting Japan is very long, and the East is once again tense. Our army has built extremely strong defenses in the area of □□□□, and the soldiers have the determination to die. Our commander has long resolved to coexist with the enemy. If the enemy attacks, we will give them a head-on blow. Even if only one soldier remains, we will fight to the end. However, our army is far away in the northern frontier, and transportation is inevitably slow. Reports on the fighting situation are often incomplete. I hope that the journalists and compatriots from all walks of life will provide our army with guidance and encouragement at any time. The officers and soldiers will work harder to repay you all. This is what our army especially prays for."</p>
<p>The Fourth Batch of Expelled Overseas Chinese from Mexico Returns Home</p>
<h3>Fifty-Nine Men, Women, and Children Landed and Went Directly to the Municipal Government to Petition The Overseas Chinese General Association Discovered Funds for Relief Three Representatives Stayed in Shanghai While the Rest Returned to Their Hometowns by Ship</h3>
<p>Xinhua News Agency reported that the situation of the anti-Chinese movement in Mexico is extremely serious. All the properties of overseas Chinese in Mexico have been seized and confiscated, and they have been expelled from the country. Three batches have already returned to the country one after another. Yesterday morning, another fourth batch of fifty-nine male and female refugee overseas Chinese returned to the country on the Hoover President of the Da Lai Company. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Arrival in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Hoover President entered the port at 8:00 AM yesterday morning and docked at the Da Lai Wharf in Bailianjing, Pudong. The Shanghai Overseas Chinese General Association specially sent its general secretary, Peng Can Guang, and more than ten people, including the reception minister Fang Di Fei, to charter a small steamer to Pudong to welcome them and take care of everything. After Peng and others arrived at the Da Lai Wharf, they boarded the Hoover President and first expressed their condolences to the returning refugees, and explained the purpose of initiating the relief effort. All the refugees expressed their gratitude. Subsequently, Peng led the refugees on a small steamer, which arrived at the New Customs Wharf at 9:15 AM and disembarked.</p>
<h3>Petition to the Municipal Government</h3>
<p>The Overseas Chinese General Association had prepared more than ten cars to transport all the refugees. They drove first to the Municipal Government at Fenglin Bridge to petition. However, due to the large number of people and Mayor Wu's busy schedule, fearing that it would disrupt important official business, refugees elected Zhang Fu Kuan and Huang Zhu Lin as representatives, accompanied by Peng Can Guang, to petition Section Chief Li Da Chao. The rest of the refugees waited in front of the Municipal Government. Li received them, and the refugee representatives first reported on the recent anti-Chinese situation in Mexico and requested that a telegram be sent to the central government to negotiate with the Mexican government as soon as possible. Li expressed that he would relay it to Mayor Wu and submit a request to the central government to issue a serious protest to Mexico. After the petition, the refugees returned in the original dozen or so cars, each with a white cloth flag bearing the words "Global Overseas Chinese General Association Welcomes Expelled Overseas Chinese from Mexico," and circled around Xiafei Road, Jing'an Temple Road, North Sichuan Road, and Zhabei. They returned to the Overseas Chinese General Association on Guizhou Road at 12:00 PM for rest.</p>
<h3>Reception Lunch</h3>
<p>At 2:30 PM, the Overseas Chinese General Association hosted a lunch at the Xin Xin Restaurant on Nanjing Road to entertain all the refugees, and the chairman of the association, lawyer Wu Cheng Yu, personally hosted the event. Before the meal, all the refugees took a group photo, followed by a meeting. Chairman Wu Cheng Yu announced the reasons for the relief effort, and Huang Zhu Lin was elected from among the refugees to report on the recent anti-Chinese situation in Mexico. He stated that on January 12 of this year, the new governor of Mexico took office and announced an extremely strict anti-Chinese policy, setting a deadline of June 31 of this year for all overseas Chinese (approximately 20,000 people) to leave the country. After the report, Peng Can Guang, the general secretary of the General Association, gave a speech. Peng rose to give a very poignant speech, which moved all the refugees and was greeted with thunderous applause. Speakers such as Fang Di Fei followed.</p>
<h3>Formation of a Maintenance Committee</h3>
<p>Later, all the refugees unanimously resolved to elect Lin Hui Yao, Lin Wen Li, and Huang Zhu Lin as representatives to stay in Shanghai to request effective relief from the government and all sectors of society, and to form a "Mexican Refugee Maintenance Committee" to unite all returning refugees to work hard to solve the current and permanent suffering. Then, refugee representative Huang Zhu Lin proposed that all the refugees join the Overseas Chinese General Association as members. Everyone applauded and unanimously approved. After the meeting, Chairman Wu Cheng Yu gave a closing speech, and the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. All the refugees then returned to the Overseas Chinese General Association for rest.</p>
<h3>Issuance of Relief Funds</h3>
<p>Subsequently, Wu Zi Yuan, a standing committee member of the association, together with accountant Hong Zhuo Guang, distributed relief funds, allocating ten yuan to each refugee, who signed for receipt. As for the actual situation of the anti-Chinese movement in Mexico, the refugee representatives promised to provide a detailed written report to reporters today.</p>

<h3>Yongyuan Licheng Ship Stranded on a Reef in Quanzhou</h3>
<p>Telegram States that the First Two Holds have Flooded</p>
<p>Customs Ship Pingqing is Providing Assistance</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that the Yongyuan Shipping Company at 15 Sijing Road, this port, received a telegram from Keelung stating that the company's Licheng ship was stranded on a reef near Xinghua, Quanzhou, and the first two holds had flooded. A reporter inquired about the details yesterday afternoon.</p>
<h3>Yongyuan Manager</h3>
<p>The Yongyuan Shipping Company is a joint-stock company, managed by Zhao Song Nian. The head office is in Qingdao, and this port is a branch office. It has four ships: Licheng, Lishun, Yongyuan, and Yuanshun. The Licheng usually travels to the northern and southern seas, such as Dalian, Yingkou, Niuzhuang, Fuzhou, Quanzhou, and Xiamen. A few days ago, it sailed from Niuzhuang to Xiamen. Yesterday morning at 7:00 AM, it suddenly ran aground near Quanzhou Bay, and the impact was very strong, causing the first two holds to flood immediately.</p>
<h3>Licheng History</h3>
<p>The Licheng was carrying soybean cakes, soybeans, miscellaneous grains, and general cargo from Niuzhuang to Fujian. The ship had a deadweight tonnage of 2,020 tons. The company bought it from a certain Japanese shipping company in this port four years ago for 100,000 yuan. The ship is in good condition, 258 feet long, and was built in 1889. It is currently insured with Lianbao Insurance Company for 80,000 silver dollars. The owner of the ship is Chinese (surname unknown), and there are thirty to forty crew members.</p>
<h3>Details of the Stranding</h3>
<p>The reason why the Licheng was stranded in Quanzhou Bay is not yet clear. According to the company's speculation, it may have been due to fog in the early morning. According to the first telegram forwarded by the ship from Keelung, the location was at 118.46 degrees east longitude and 24.49 degrees north latitude, near Quanzhou Bay. The first telegram stated that the Licheng ran aground near Quanzhou at 7:00 AM on the 12th and requested that a rescue ship be dispatched immediately. The second telegram, sent at 10:00 AM, was received by the Shanghai Coast Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications and forwarded to the Customs and the company. It stated that the Licheng was stranded, the first two holds had flooded, and the Pingqing ship was rushing to rescue and protect it, with further reports to follow. However, after receiving the first telegram, the company immediately sent a telegram inquiring about the cargo and the cause of the accident, but had not received a reply as of 6:00 PM yesterday.</p>
<h3>Attempts to Rescue</h3>
<p>Upon hearing the news, Yongyuan immediately contacted Lianbao Insurance to arrange for a rescue ship to go to the rescue in this port, which may depart today. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter visited the company, where they met customs officials. They announced that the Licheng had run aground, and the customs had received two telegrams. The Customs ship Pingqing (Pingching) had already arrived and was doing its best to rescue and protect the ship. They had a telegram that could be sent to the Pingqing ship for inquiries (the two telegrams were the same as those received by the company and were therefore not recorded). The company claimed that the Customs ship Pingqing was providing protection because the area was known to be frequented by pirates.</p>
<p>Raise Funds for National Aviation Salvation</p>
<h3>First Day of Boy Scout Mobilization</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the first day of the Boy Scout mobilization to raise funds for National Aviation Salvation. At 9:00 AM, the city's Boy Scouts, divided into 51 teams, carrying flags, donation books, and Aviation Association badges and membership cards, went to various roads to solicit donations. When they encountered cars and rickshaws, they stopped them. If the passengers had not yet joined the association, they were immediately persuaded to donate. Receipts and membership cards were issued. Many enthusiastic patriots made generous donations. However, there were also some who were reluctant and evasive. The funds raised by the Boy Scouts were deposited in the Shanghai Bank in each district, and the bank notified the Boy Scout Council. Therefore, the total number of yesterday's results has not yet been tallied. What is known is that the Southeast Boy Scouts raised more than 300 yuan yesterday.</p>
<p>Zhengtai Factory</p>
<h3>Donates to Shanghai Workers' Aircraft</h3>
<p>The Zhengtai Rubber Factory in this port, which produces Daxipai, Wannianqingpai, Sanbapai brands of galoshes, running shoes, and athletic shoes, is of high quality and low price, and its sales reach across the country. It is one of the leading factories in the country, with over one thousand employees. The factory has a long-standing patriotic enthusiasm. Previously, it received an order from the Bureau of Social Affairs, instructing the factory to donate all of its wages from March 11th to the Shanghai Workers' Aircraft. The factory complied and donated 200 yuan, which was personally delivered by Shen Bolin, an employee of the factory, to the Shenbao for deposit in the bank. The factory can be said to be enthusiastically patriotic.</p>
<h3>Sun Dianying Cables Thanks to Overseas Chinese for Donations</h3>
<p>Sun Dianying, the commander of the 41st Army, led his troops to fight against the Japanese and puppet troops for several months in Rehe Province. Even though the soldiers were hungry and tired, they were still able to resist the powerful enemy. He sent a telegram to thank the overseas Chinese for their donations, which read: "Shanghai, Ren Yuandao, brother, forward to the General Branch of the Kuomintang in San Francisco, USA, please note. We have received the generous donation of 4,000 yuan, which has greatly inspired our morale. We will certainly eliminate the powerful enemy to live up to your great expectations. We send this telegram to express our gratitude and wish you safe travels." Lu Jun, Commander of the 41st Army, Sun Kuiyuan, and all the officers and soldiers kowtow together.</p>
<p>Li Jingcong Discusses the Successful Test Flight of the Guangdong-Hankou Railway</p>
<h3>Two More Points Need to be Resolved Formal Opening Expected in Late Summer or Early Autumn</h3>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Company, to open the Guangdong-Hankou air route, had its manager, Li Jingcong, and deputy chief of flight, Walter, leave Shanghai on the 4th for a test flight to Hankou and to inspect the entire route. They returned on the 11th after a successful test flight. Yesterday, Manager Li told a reporter from the Central News Agency that the results of the test flight were very satisfactory. The formal opening of the route is still to be planned in detail. Li's remarks are summarized as follows:</p>
<h3>Test Flight Details</h3>
<p>Li said that the planning for the Guangdong-Hankou route has been underway for a long time. Merchants in Guangdong urgently need this route, and Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications has repeatedly urged its early opening to benefit the people. Therefore, taking advantage of the current lack of development in the Northwest route, a test flight was carried out first. On the morning of the 4th, I and Deputy Chief Walter took the Eurasia No. 5 aircraft to Hankou for a test flight. The aircraft was piloted by Rajai. When passing through Beijing, we stopped for an hour to discuss matters with Minister Zhu and continued to fly on that evening, arriving in Hankou. On the 5th, we flew from Hanam and passed Changsha. Because the airport was small, we did not land and planned to fly directly to Guangzhou. However, when we reached the Jiufeng Mountains, we were forced to turn back to Changsha due to thick fog. On the 6th, we continued to fly south. When passing the Jiufeng Mountains, we flew low through the mountain pass. After exiting the pass, we crossed Shaoguan without stopping and arrived safely in Guangzhou around 3:00 PM. We visited the military and political authorities to humbly request their assistance. After resting for a day, we flew from Guangzhou to Hong Kong on the 8th, planning to extend the route to the port. We specifically visited the British Governor to seek his opinion, and he verbally expressed his welcome. Therefore, we immediately asked the government to assist in the negotiation. On the 9th, we flew north from Hong Kong and arrived in Guangzhou that same day. On the 10th, we arrived in Hankou, and on the 11th, we passed through Beijing and arrived in Shanghai. I stayed in Beijing for half a day to discuss matters with the ministry and took the night train to Shanghai. Chief Walter flew back to Shanghai on the original aircraft on the same day.</p>
<h3>Two Difficulties</h3>
<p>Li continued to tell the reporter that the test flight was successful, but there were two points that still needed to be resolved: (1) The facilities on the route. At a considerable distance, there must be reserve airfields for takeoff and landing when necessary. Although the Northwest route does not have this equipment, there are many open plains along the way, and it is possible to land anywhere in case of danger. On the other hand, the Guangdong-Hankou route is crisscrossed with fields, all of which are paddy fields. In case of obstacles, it is not possible to land. Many airports must be equipped, but the company cannot afford it on its own. We have been in contact with the Ministry of Communications to request assistance. (2) The mountains in Hunan Province are winding and foggy, and the Jiufeng Mountains are so high that they reach into the clouds, making flying very difficult. We plan to set up radio stations in Yizhang Lushi to report on the weather to indicate where to go and avoid danger.</p>
<h3>Summer Navigation</h3>
<p>The above two points are now being actively planned. Within one to three months, preparations will be completed, and navigation should be possible by late summer or early autumn. The entire route will serve three stations: Hankou, Changsha, and Guangzhou. Including stopover times, the journey will take approximately six and a half hours. The airports in Changsha and Guangzhou will temporarily use those belonging to the Ministry of Military Affairs, and only land-based aircraft will be used for flights. Shaoguan only has a seaplane base, and it is very small, so a station will not be set up there for the time being. However, this plan is only the southern section of the entire route. There is also a northern section extending north from Hankou, passing through Xiangyang and reaching Xi'an, to connect with the Northwest Line. However, testing and planning of everything must wait until the Canton-Hankou section is officially opened to traffic.</p>

<p>Labor Representative to the International Labor Conference</p>
<h3>Central Government Appoints Li Yongxiang</h3>
<p>Li is a Standing Committee Member of the Shanghai General Labor Union</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the current session of the International Labor Conference is being held in Europe and is nearing its end. The representative from our country's employer side was long ago appointed to be Yan Qingxiang, a prominent cotton merchant, and has already left Shanghai to go abroad. The government representative has also been instructed to be the ambassador stationed in the nearby country. As for the labor representative seat, it was originally intended for Wang Boling, a member of the Central Committee, but because Mr. Wang is not from the labor community and cannot understand the suffering of the laborers, he was opposed by various labor unions in Shanghai. It is now learned that the Central Government has decided to appoint Li Yongxiang, a standing committee member of the Shanghai General Labor Union, as the labor representative. This has been approved by the Central Standing Committee and will soon be formally ordered by the National Government. It is said that Li has been working hard in the workers' movement in Shanghai and has a considerable history.</p>
<h3>German Experts to Sichuan to Survey Mines</h3>

It is also learned that as soon as the exploration proves effective, the industrial development plan will be prepared for implementation, and Mr. Ge Letai of the company has been handling everything with foreign industrialists.</p>
<h3>Postal Foundation Case Still Not Fully Resolved</h3>
<p>Postal Research Association Continued Meeting Yesterday</p>
<p>Announced Adjournment for One Week</p>
<p>The Postal Economic System Research Committee continued its seventh general meeting yesterday to discuss the outline for consolidating the postal foundation reform. The dispute between the Ministry and the employees regarding the selection and performance evaluation of personnel in the Savings and Remittances Bureau has not yet been resolved. For the sake of prudence, the committee announced an adjournment for one week to seek an appropriate solution. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Attendees: The Postal System Research Association held its seventh general meeting at the Municipal Government at 5 pm yesterday. Attendees included committee members Wu Tiecheng, Lin Kanghou, Lin Shi, Pan Gongzhan, Huang Naishu, Tang Shu, Du Yuesheng, and others, totaling seven people. Attending as observers were specialist committee members Wang Wenwei, Li Gan, Lin Zou, Jing Runying, Shen Yangyi, Lou Zuyi, and others, totaling six people. There were also twelve employee representatives from the postal service: Zhu Fan, Kang Yong, Zhang Kechang, Shi Yitang, Qi Jiamou, Zhu Jingsheng, Fan Caicong, Zheng Zhenhuang, Shi Jikuan, Ge Fei, Zhao Shusheng, and Lu Keming, for a total of twenty-five people.</p>
<p>Dispute Unresolved: Regarding the selection and performance evaluation of personnel in the Savings and Remittances Bureau, disputes arose between the Ministry and the employees, which led to delays in resolution. Committee members Lin Kanghou and Pan Gongzhan, along with several employee representatives, went to the Cangzhou Hotel at 10 am yesterday to meet with Minister Zhu to exchange opinions in order to find a solution. The discussion lasted until noon. Subsequently, at 5 pm in the afternoon, the general meeting continued at the Municipal Government. The committee members revised clauses D and E of the second article of the outline for consolidating the postal foundation reform. However, the principle of dual power remained unchanged, and the textual revisions were insufficient to remedy the situation. The Ministry insisted that personnel in the Savings and Remittances Bureau, after being screened, should be treated as additional personnel and not considered postal workers. The employees insisted that personnel in the Savings and Remittances Bureau must pass an examination and be ranked as postal personnel; otherwise, their treatment should not exceed that of postal workers. The discussion continued until about 7:30 pm. The two sides fiercely debated the selection and performance evaluation of personnel in the Savings and Remittances Bureau, and their opinions could not be reconciled. For the sake of prudence, the committee formally announced an adjournment of the meeting for one week to allow both sides to make a final consideration. The meeting is scheduled to continue at the Municipal Government on the 19th, and Lin Kanghou was designated to visit Minister Zhu again to exchange opinions in order to find a solution. If the dispute between the two sides remains unresolved when the meeting continues next week, the committee will submit the opinions of both sides to the Ministry for review.</p>

Also, regarding China's establishment of a special bureau for trade with the Soviet Union, Mr. Bogomolov stated that the Soviet government considers this approach to be discriminatory towards the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Also, yesterday's local Russian newspaper reported that the Soviet Vice-Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Milikovsky, denied the news of Litvinov's conversation. Now, our agency has been notified that Mr. Milikovsky has denied ever meeting with anyone.</p>

<h3>County Government Urges Completion of Winter Grain Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government has already merged and taken over the County Finance Bureau and started working. Now, County Magistrate Cao has checked the county's winter grain tax for the 21st year (of the Republic), which is the second installment of land value tax. It has been overdue for a long time, and the amount collected is only 60-70%. The deficit is huge, which clearly indicates insufficient efforts in collection. However, the province is urging the remittance of national taxes very urgently, so the county government summoned the tax collection officials from each district to the county yesterday for strict instruction and set a deadline for clearing the outstanding winter grain tax in installments.</p>
<p>Also, the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, due to the county's finance being merged into the county government for handling, has stated that officials should be sent to supervise the inventory of all taxes and accounts.

<p>To Severely Punish the Perpetrator of the Gao Case</p>
<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Citizens' Joint Association of the Second Special District of the city sent a letter to the Director General of the French Concession Police yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding a letter from the Yangzhou Eight Counties Fellow Townsmen Association in Shanghai, which reported that Hu Shunyuan, a member of the association, stated that on the morning of the 7th of this month, Gao Yatou, an apprentice at the barber shop, went out to do business and encountered a Western policeman No. 39 on South Avenue (Avenue Joffre) near the Wangkang Sauce Garden in Qianjiatang. The policeman, under the pretext of checking his license, first grabbed Gao Yatou and slapped him, then kicked him several times, causing Gao Yatou to die from his injuries on the spot. The policeman then fled. Outraged passersby, led by the owner of a witness business, chased and brought the policeman back. Many people witnessed the incident and photos were taken and kept as evidence by the Public Works Department. The body has been moved to the Tongren Fuyuantang for examination. Your association is requested to uphold justice and provide legal assistance to comfort the departed spirit. Upon investigation, this association found that the facts are true. This association believes that checking licenses should be done through normal procedures. Why resort to violence, resulting in death?

Having received this report, this association cannot remain silent and specifically requests your Director General to severely punish the perpetrator, provide generous compensation to the family of the deceased, and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future, so as to comfort the deceased and reassure the people. Maintaining public trust."</p>

<p>English and American Labor Unrest Difficult to Resolve, Operations Completely Suspended at Three Factories</p>
<h3>Labor Union Requests Convening of General Meeting to Discuss Solutions, Social Affairs Bureau Convened Mediation Yesterday with No Results</h3>
<p>Since the British American Tobacco Company announced that the first and second factories in Pudong and the third factory in East Shanghai would all reduce their work to three days a week, it has caused a reaction from the workers, resulting in the closure of the motors. All factories completely stopped working yesterday, and the situation is becoming more and more serious. The Social Affairs Bureau convened mediation in the afternoon, but it was ineffective. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3>All Three Factories Stop Working</h3>
<p>The first factory in Lujiazui, Pudong, and the second factory in Lujiazhai have stopped working since the motors were shut down by some workers the day before yesterday afternoon. Workers in all departments did not go to work yesterday. According to the company's announced reduction plan, Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday are for the tobacco shredding, carpentry, leaf, tobacco cutting, tobacco baking, machinery, stove, and box departments. Tin packing and copper departments are scheduled to work on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Yesterday, except for the tin packing and copper departments, which had about 400 workers working as usual, all other departments, with about 10,000 workers, stopped working. At the same time, the third factory on Taopeng Road in East Shanghai had its iron gate closed, preventing workers from entering the factory. According to the labor side, it is feared that it will be difficult to resume work in the near future.</p>
<h3>Labor Side Petitions Party and Government</h3>
<p>The Fifth District Cigarette Workers Union believes that the factory suddenly reducing work to three days a week in one month concerns the livelihood of the workers, causing serious disputes. It is urgent to convene a general meeting of all workers to discuss solutions. Therefore, yesterday morning at 10 am, they elected representatives Chen Peide, Liu Dehua, and five others to petition the Municipal Party Department, putting forward two requests: (1) Permission to convene a workers' congress next Tuesday to discuss countermeasures; (2) Requesting the Party and government to order the factory to restore the original state to avoid the expansion of the labor unrest. Zhang Sheng, the director of the Civil Movement Section, received them and approved the request to convene a congress, promising to inform the Public Security Bureau to provide protection. Regarding the request to order the factory to restore the original state, he agreed to handle it together with the Social Affairs Bureau. At the same time, the workers of the third factory in East Shanghai, because the factory closed the iron gate and prevented them from going to work, also sent representatives Lei Qiang, Chen Shikui, and several others to petition the Social Affairs Bureau first. Wang Gang of the Third Section received them and replied that the Social Affairs Bureau had scheduled mediation for this afternoon, hoping that the workers would wait patiently for a solution and not take any drastic action. They then went to the Municipal Party Department to petition, and Lu Yinchu of the Civil Movement Section received them and expressed acceptance of the workers' demands, promising to handle them together with the Social Affairs Bureau. Only then did the workers leave.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Mediation Ineffective</h3>
<p>In order to prevent the expansion of the dispute, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau convened mediation between the two parties at 3 pm yesterday. Chen Peide and Liu Dehua from the labor side, Mr. Lideke (American) from the factory side, translator Chen Xingzhou, and Zhou Lianze from the Municipal Party Department attended. The meeting was chaired by Wang Gang of the Social Affairs Bureau. First, the factory representative reported that the company's sales have been sluggish recently and inventory is piling up. Based on the current sales situation, it is only possible to work two days a week, but in order to take care of the livelihood of the workers, it has been decided to reduce it to three days a week. The labor representative stated that the company has been reducing work to three days in one month, making it difficult for the workers to maintain their livelihoods, and it also violates the labor-capital contract signed in 1928. After repeated persuasion from the Party and government authorities, both parties made concessions, but the labor-capital attitudes remained firm, and it was impossible to resolve the situation. Finally, it was decided that the factory side should submit a written explanation of the reasons for the reduction of work to the bureau for approval this week and then schedule mediation again.</p>
<h3>Factory Representative Expresses Responsibility</h3>
<p>A reporter from the Ta Kung Pao specifically interviewed Mr. Lideke (transliteration), the personnel director of the company, yesterday. According to him, the factory's business has been affected since the outbreak of the war in North China. Usually, it could ship more than 12,000 boxes a day, but recently sales have suddenly been sluggish and inventory has piled up, so it was necessary to reduce work to three days a week to inject funds. The daily salary of the workers in each factory is about 16,000 yuan. If they work as usual, the wage burden would be heavy, and the amount of goods piled up would be even greater, which would lead to bankruptcy. Therefore, he hoped that the workers would understand the difficulties of the factory and accept this measure.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Appoints Committee to Review Milk Disinfection Issues</h3>
<p>In order to improve the quality of milk within the concession, the Shanghai Municipal Council, based on the suggestion of the Director of the Health Department, has proposed the establishment of a disinfection plant (Pasteurization Plant) to disinfect Grade B milk (Grade B milk) to reduce the risk of drinking it. After consideration by the Health Committee, the entire committee believes that disinfection is beneficial, but it is more appropriate to allow private operation. It has been decided to appoint a small committee to specifically study this issue. Messrs C. Burgess, A. Hughes, G. H. Wright, and Yuan Ludeng have been appointed as committee members. The scope of work of this investigation committee has also been formulated as follows: (1) To continue the work of the Milk Investigation Committee from 1923 to 1924, studying the cleanliness of milk within the concession; (2) To consider the mandatory disinfection of milk within the concession; (3) Based on the previous article, to consider the most convenient and effective method of disinfecting Grade B milk; (4) To consider the Health Department's central disinfection plant plan, deciding whether it should be run by the council or operated by private companies, subject to considerable restrictions; (5) According to the previous article, to decide whether the disinfection plant should be operated by one company exclusively or divided among several companies; (6) To decide how to manage this disinfection; (7) To investigate the opinions of the dairy farmers, formulating a plan to avoid conflicts with their interests as much as possible; (8) To consider the management methods of transporting milk within the concession and whether to implement regular vaccinations for certain cattle diseases. The above measures have been approved by the Board of Directors on the 11th of this month. Also, during the Health Committee's meeting, the Health Department stated that it does not want to allow milk produced outside the concession to be sold within the concession. If it is smuggled in, it can be prevented, but it believes that it can cooperate with the authorities of the adjacent areas to allow licenses to be mutually recognized and to achieve effective management. In this way, Grade A milk from outside the concession can also be allowed into the concession in the future. Regarding this matter, it has already made informal contact with the authorities of the neighboring areas.</p>

<h3>Second Batch of Spring Fish Arrives Yesterday</h3>
<p>This Time, the Fish Haul is Abundant</p>
<p>The Wu Song Bao Feng Fish Firm received more than ten boats of second-batch yellow croaker yesterday, including boats named Zuo Zengmao, Guang Zengshun, and Fu Fashun. The Cui Sheng and Shen Tai fish firms also received several boats such as Chen Shunxing and Gao Xiangmao. This time, the fish haul for each boat was quite large, generally over four or five holds, so the market price has slightly decreased. Downriver, each "chou" is sold for thirteen "jin" by market scale, which is equivalent to about eleven "jin" by the old balance scale. Therefore, merchants from various ports, Shanghai merchants, and local households have come to Wu Song to purchase, creating a very crowded scene. The Wu Song market is also more lively than before. According to the boatmen, the second batch of fish appeared on the fifteenth evening of the lunar calendar, and the fish haul was quite abundant. Moreover, the southern tide season came earlier than in previous years, causing all the fishing boats to suffer from having too much fish and not enough salt. In order to preserve high-quality salted fish, they would rather sell the remaining fresh fish at a low price if they ran out of salt. It is said that there are still large fleets of fishing boats scheduled to arrive in Wu Song in the coming days.</p>

<h3>The Invention of the Tonghua Rainproof Textile Factory</h3>
<p>Mr. Ni Songsheng, a technician at the Tonghua Rainproof Textile Factory in Huairen Lane, Huining Road, Nanshi, Shanghai, studied in Germany in his earlier years, specializing in dyeing and finishing techniques. After completing his studies, he worked in a factory in Germany, achieving outstanding results. He returned to China two years ago and traveled to various famous regions. He saw that the raincoats sold in the market were all imported goods, causing a loss of several million yuan every year. In contrast, there were no domestic products that could compete with them. Therefore, he devoted himself to research for a long time and finally invented rainproof cloth, rainproof silk, rainproof wool, rainproof serge, etc. All of these are made from domestic cotton, silk, and other textiles, using scientific methods and chemical materials. Not only are the materials of excellent quality, making them suitable for clothing that can be used in both sunny and rainy weather, but they are also washable, durable, and waterproof, without the problems of being airtight or having a sticky odor. The results directly surpass imported products, and the low price is just an added bonus. It is said that all kinds of rainproof textiles have been appraised by important figures in Beijing and Shanghai, and have been praised as unprecedented achievements. Therefore, since the factory opened and set up a distribution center on Penglai Road, Laoximen, only a little over two months have passed. Due to the crowds of customers, wool fabrics are in short supply. It is now expanding greatly and opening night shifts to meet the needs of the Chinese people.</p>

<h3>Miao Chen Sells Articles to Save the Country</h3>
<p>丨Proceeds Donated to the Frontline Aid Team丨</p>
<p>Recommended by Ma Xiangbo and Chen Shiyi</p>
<p>Zhang Taiyan Also Expresses Deep Sympathy</p>
<p>Mr. Miao Zicai, a philosophy professor at Xiamen University, is well-versed in philosophy and skilled in literature. Because Elder Ma Xiangbo has initiated the "Intolerable Society" aid team, which requires extensive efforts and large sums of money, he intends to exchange his energy for writing fees to donate to the expenses. Elder Chen Shiyi has set the prices. All patriotic and charitable people from home and abroad who wish to purchase articles by Mr. Chen Shiyi or Mr. Miao Zicai should deliver or mail their biographies and fees to the Lexiantang, Tushanwan, Xujiahui, Shanghai. Recently, the Lexiantang issued a special announcement stating that the "Intolerable Society" was initiated by ninety-four-year-old Ma Xiangbo. Reverend Lei Mingyuan, a Belgian missionary, led more than two hundred and forty missionaries and a large number of aid team members to the frontline war zone to provide on-site aid to wounded soldiers and refugees. This kind of work that brings the dead back to life, along with the provision of medicine, equipment, and labor, is something that all those who embrace humanitarianism cannot help but sympathize with. Elder Ma is making various efforts to provide assistance in Shanghai. This time, Mr. Chen and Mr. Miao also believe that it is their national duty to do everything they can to contribute to this effort, no matter how small. At the same time, Mr. Zhang Taiyan also praised it highly and introduced it, saying, "Miao Zhuancai of Taixian is learned and knowledgeable, and also skilled in writing. He has written explanations for my works such as 'On the Equality of Things,' all of which are the result of more than ten years of effort. He is currently teaching in Xiamen and is willing to sell his articles for the 'Intolerable Society' aid team to contribute to the effort. I also express my deep sympathy."</p>
<h3>A Bomb on Rue de Remi</h3>

<h3>Deer Lays an Egg</h3>
<p>丨The Materia Medica Calls it "Heart-Protecting Stone," Which Can Treat Heart Pain, Vomiting Blood, and Other Symptoms丨</p>
<p>Mr. Li Shaoguang, a mental physician at No. 656 New Weihaiwei Road in this city, has a deer egg in his collection. It is shaped like a chicken egg, solid on the outside and hollow on the inside, containing very dense strange herbs. The shell is hard and layered, resembling the texture of deer antlers. Its shape is quite peculiar. It is said that his ancestors obtained it from the belly of a deer when they conquered the aborigines. At that time, soldiers who suffered from fever were cured by grinding it with water and drinking it. Afterwards, over the years, the inner strange herbs were revealed. It has been treasured to this day for future use. According to the Compendium of Materia Medica, there is a "Heart-Protecting Stone" that grows in the belly of a deer. The deer eats various detoxification herbs, and its essence accumulates over time and solidifies into a stone, also known as a gemstone. There are two types, one is formed in the deer, and the other is made by Western doctors who collect rare herbs in Lesser Western Countries. Taking it can prevent toxic gases from attacking the heart, hence the name "Heart-Protecting Stone." The method of use is to scrape six grains the size of wheat with a knife, make them into powder, and take them. More can be used without harm, and it will increase energy. Regular use of this medicine will prevent intestinal worms from growing in the abdomen, strengthen the body, and invigorate the spirit. It also treats severe fever and thirst, urinary retention, and diarrhea, all of which are taken with water. For chest injuries and depression without fever, it can be taken with wine or water. If there is fever, it can be taken with half wine and half water. For weakness after illness, it can be taken with half wine and half water. For chest pain, wind-cold qi pain, vomiting roundworms, coughing up blood, and vomiting blood, it can be taken with water. For snake and insect bites, it can be taken with or without wine. For knife and arrow wounds, mad dog bites, and poisonings, apply the powder to the wound, and cover it with cloth to heal it. All of this is seen in the Materia Medica Supplement. It is one of the types of "Heart-Protecting Stone" collected by Mr. Li. This substance was known before the Ming Dynasty, but it is rare in the world. It is specially recorded here for the reference of medical and pharmaceutical professionals.</p>

<h3>Madman Randomly Chops People on the Street</h3>
<p>Da Chunpu Shot and Killed</p>
<p>Da Yisheng, a 54-year-old Nanjing native, was a small vendor. His wife, Liu, was 54 years old. They had a son named Chunpu, who was 34 years old. The family of three lived together in a small room under an overpass at No. 66 Lane, Huajin Road, due to their poor financial situation. However, Chunpu suffered from mental illness, so he was still unmarried at his age. When his illness flared up on weekdays, he would cry and laugh uncontrollably. Sometimes, he would even drag his parents into the streets and run wildly, or beat them with sticks. Although Da was disturbed by this, he could not bear to abandon his son due to their father-son relationship, so he still kept him at home. Unexpectedly, yesterday afternoon at around 3:00 pm, Chunpu's mental illness flared up again. He suddenly took a kitchen knife from his home and wielded it wildly in the street, chopping at anyone he encountered. At that time, passersby scattered and fled in all directions. When Chunpu reached the entrance of Huajin Road, Lou Xiru, a 42-year-old Ningbo native, happened to be there. He lived at No. 9, Huaixian Lane, Xueyuan Road, and was a salesman at the Yixing Company on Ermalu. He was coming out of his house on business when he passed by the area. Chunpu took advantage of his unpreparedness, caught up from behind, and raised the kitchen knife to chop at Lou's neck. Lou noticed it, but it was too late to avoid it, so he was chopped on the neck with a knife, about four inches long and several points deep. Blood flowed like a torrent. Lou turned around to look and saw that the person wielding the knife was a madman. Knowing that there was no point in reasoning with him, he immediately hired a rickshaw and went to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is said that his injuries are very serious. However, after Chunpu chopped at Lou, he continued to wield the kitchen knife and headed straight for Hongqiao. A large crowd followed him, but no one dared to step forward to catch him. Wu Linqing, a police officer on duty at the nearby No. 32 post, noticed him and knew that he would cause trouble, so he quickly stepped forward and ordered him to stop, intending to arrest him. Unexpectedly, Chunpu was not afraid when he saw the police arrive. Instead, he raised the knife and chopped at Officer Wu's left hand. Officer Wu could not avoid it and was chopped on his left hand, immediately injuring the web of his hand and causing it to bleed. Seeing that he was so reckless, Officer Wu had no choice but to pull out his pistol and fire a shot at the ground. At this time, Chunpu had only walked a few steps and stumbled and fell to the ground due to his hasty steps. As a result, the bullet fired by Officer Wu accidentally hit Chunpu's chest. However, Chunpu still tried to struggle to get up after being injured. Officer Wu took the opportunity to bravely rush forward while injured, snatch the kitchen knife, and finally capture him. After taking him back to the No. 2 Precinct of the First District, Chunpu was exhausted, pale, and short of breath. The precinct sent police to take him to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment, but he died before he could be treated after arriving at the hospital.</p>

<p>The International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, due to the disastrous decline in the tea market, urgently needs to find ways to remedy the situation. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 3:00 pm, it convened the City Tea Industry Association, Huacha Company, and various tea merchants at the bureau's conference room to discuss relief measures. The details of the meeting are recorded below:</p>
<h3>Attending Representatives</h3>
<p>The attending representatives included Guo Weibai, Director of General Affairs of the International Trade Bureau, Ji Zejin, Director of the Guidance Department and Secretary, Zhang Pansun, Chen Yizhou, Peng Zhiping, Zhuo Huapu, Sun Zishou, Hu Dexin, representatives of the Tea Industry Association, Hong Mengpan, representative of Jin Jianxing Company, Chen Bingwen, Chen Xiaowen, representative of Fan Baosheng Company, Wang Yinting, representative of Wang Yutai Company, and more than ten other people.</p>
<h3>Discussion of Measures</h3>
<p>After the meeting began, Chairman Guo Weibai reported on the purpose of the meeting and briefly described the opinions of Tao Yin, the Deputy Consul of China in Liverpool, to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on improving tea and promoting international trade. Then, Ji Zejin proposed several relief measures for open discussion. Each representative expressed their opinions. The final decisions were: (1) Improvement of tea exports: (A) How to make the tea taste stronger to suit the British preference. The rural economy of our country is declining, and old tea trees are planted and old tea production methods are used, in the hope of taking shortcuts, resulting in a decline in sales. Now, we should focus on increasing fertilizer and cultivation. (B) How to make the selling price lower to compete with Indian, Ceylonese, and Japanese tea. Samples of various teas should be sent to our country's consuls in various countries, especially focusing on the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia, to widely promote them. The consuls should also investigate the names and locations of companies that purchase Chinese tea so that they can trade directly without going through foreign merchants, so as to reduce costs and expand sales channels. (C) Regarding foreign tariffs on Chinese tea, Finance Minister Song Ziwen should be telegraphed to pay attention to this matter and try to reduce tariffs when attending the London Economic Conference. (D) Regarding whether advertising or replanting with Indian or Ceylonese tea would be effective, this matter is difficult to implement. Rural inspections must be carried out first to find ways to improve. (2) Regarding the sale of tea to Russia: (A) The City Foreign Firm Tea Industry Association has submitted a request to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to forward it to the Ministry of Finance for relief. The Ministry of Finance has instructed the Shanghai banks and money shops to provide relief. We must consult with them again. (B) The establishment of a special bureau for trade with Russia has been discussed between Minister of Industry and Commerce Chen Gongbo and Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov in Beijing. The Russian ambassador expressed his support. Today, the Russian state-owned TASS news agency has raised objections, saying that our country has not established special bureaus for trade with Japan and the United Kingdom, but only with Russia, which is considered unequal. This still needs to be discussed further.</p>
<h3>Petition for Relief</h3>
<p>The original document from Chen Zhaoshou, Chairman of the Shanghai Foreign Firms Tea Trade Association, and other committee members, to the Ministry of Industry, is hereby recorded below: Petitioning for special relief due to the extreme decline of exported boxed tea. It is humbly submitted that the export of black and green boxed tea has historically been handled by foreign merchants to Europe and America, with Russian merchants being particularly significant buyers, accounting for as much as half of the entire trade at its peak. Since the 18th year (of the Republic), the amount has decreased year by year, and in the 21st year, Russian merchants reduced their purchases drastically, almost to zero, with a total purchase of only over 30,000 boxes for the whole year, valued at less than 600,000. Purchases of tea dust, old tea, and compressed tea bricks from Hankou for export were also no more than 300 taels. The reasons for this are attributed to competition and encroachment from India, Ceylon, Java, and Japan, as well as the economic policies of those countries, which restrict tea consumption. However, the biggest reason is that Russian merchants are assisting foreign firms in purchasing tea from India, Ceylon, Java, and Japan, with payment terms of twelve months from the date of shipment, while purchases in China require immediate cash payment. Therefore, they abandon China for these other countries. Chinese tea merchants are weak and unable to compete with foreign tea. Zhaoshou sought an audience with the Vice President of the Central Bank, who advised him to detail the plight to the Ministry for thorough investigation of the current procedures for Russian merchants purchasing foreign tea and to seek relief. Therefore, without fear of being presumptuous, we present a detailed account of the entire situation, appealing for extraordinary support so that natural domestic products do not disappear from foreign markets. It is estimated that the decline in trade in both Shanghai and Hankou totals four to five million taels annually, causing widespread distress. We humbly request that Your Excellency forward this information to Minister of Finance Song, requesting that a syndicate be designated to lend large sums to Russian merchants specifically for purchasing Chinese tea, which would alleviate this crisis. We beg that a method be devised, and that the Russian merchants be invited to discuss the matter, as rescuing the nation and aiding businesses rests on this single action. Respectfully submitted to Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry.</p>
<p>Robbery News via Telephone</p>
<h3>Chen Wanyou Upheld the Meaning of Mutual Assistance by Disregarding Danger and Personally Investigating at a Neighbor's Home</h3>
<p>丨Detectives Arrived, but the Robbers Were Gone, Only Apprehending One Lookout丨</p>
<p>In the Anqing Lane of the Moore Road area in western Shanghai, there were five houses, among which No. 142 was the residence of Hou Anzhou, a rickshaw puller. Adjacent to No. 141 was Chen Wanyou's paint business. Hou's family was quite wealthy, attracting the attention of bandits. At 6:30 AM the previous morning, six robbers formed a gang and secretly went to commit robbery. After reaching Anqing Lane, one robber was assigned to loiter at the lane entrance as a lookout. The five robbers entered the lane and knocked on Hou's front door. At that time, Chen Wanyou's rickshaw puller, Li Asan, was squatting at Chen's doorstep washing clothes. He suddenly saw a stranger and was suspicious. Then, Hou's double doors creaked open, and the five robbers swarmed in, forcibly dragging the person who opened the door inside. The door was then closed tightly. Li became even more suspicious and quickly informed Chen Wanyou of the situation. Chen had known Hou for a long time and, suspecting that these unexpected visitors might be robbers, decided not to stand idly by. He tried to call Hou Anzhou on the phone, but the five robbers had already begun the robbery. Three robbers with handguns went upstairs to search for valuables, while the other two robbers were downstairs to prevent the occupants from raising an alarm. Hou heard the phone ringing and picked up the receiver. As soon as he began to speak, the robbers snatched the phone away. Chen Wanyou was unaware that Hou had been prevented from speaking, so he kept listening on the phone. Although Hou was unable to speak directly to Chen, the broken words he spoke to the robbers, "My family has no money; even if we did, it would be in the bank. Why have you come to demand it?" were all transmitted to Chen's ear through the phone. Chen then knew for certain that Hou's house had been robbed. He immediately reported the situation to the Jing'an Temple Police Station via telephone, requesting that detectives be dispatched quickly. He wanted to determine the truth of the robbery, disregarding the danger, he personally went to Hou's house to investigate. Before leaving, he told his rickshaw puller, Li Asan, "If I go to Hou's house and don't come out immediately, then there must be robbers in his house. I will surely be monitored by the robbers. You must quickly urge the police station to send detectives." After speaking, he went to knock on Hou's door. The robbers inside heard the knocking, opened the door, and immediately dragged Chen inside. Li saw that his master had indeed fallen into danger and shouted Chen's name wildly. The robbers in the house recognized the voice as belonging to their lookout accomplice and, thinking that the matter had been exposed, abandoned their search of boxes and chests. They only grabbed the stolen clothes, jewelry, and cash and rushed out of the door, fleeing out of the lane. When the police detectives arrived in cars, all five robbers had already disappeared. Only the Anhui-native robber Xi Shaoting, who was acting as a lookout at the entrance of the lane, was still loitering and was arrested. They then entered Hou's house to inquire about the circumstances of the robbery. Hou and Chen briefly recounted the events. Chen also said that after he entered the house, the silver dollars in his pocket, totaling one dollar and eighty cents, were also stolen. Hou estimated the loss to be over 950 yuan, and a list was given to the detectives, along with Xi, to be taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi conducted a preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Li Zhishan requested that the robber Xi be interrogated and then detained for further investigation. Detectives Wu Zhiyun, Ma Derong, Guan Huchen, and others reported the process of apprehending Xi. Xi Shaoting claimed that he was passing by and went into the lane to buy a pancake when he was arrested. However, witnesses such as Li Asan testified that Xi was indeed a lookout robber, and there were no pancake vendors in the lane. Judge Wu then ordered Xi Shaoting to be remanded in custody, with a new hearing scheduled in seven days for further investigation.</p>
<h3>Large Bomb Excavated from Tanzigang, Weighing Approximately 300 Pounds</h3>
<p>Tanzigang in Zhabei had been silted up for a long time, making navigation difficult. Therefore, local gentry and merchants recently hired workers to dredge it. Yesterday at around 10:00 AM, the river workers were excavating the soil when they suddenly discovered a large black bomb. They immediately found a way to lift it out. It was shaped like an olive with a flat bottom, and at the bottom was an iron ring, with a diameter of about one foot. It weighed approximately 300 pounds. At the same time, a large cannonball, weighing more than ten pounds, was also excavated. Guo Shunji, a local merchant, concerned about the safety of the river workers, had them send it to the second team of the Pengpu Security Corps, who then forwarded it to the Fourth District Public Security Bureau for disposal.</p>
<p>Deceptive Acts by the Japanese</p>
<h3>Selling Flour as Tooth-Setting Powder and Taking the Opportunity to Steal Over 400 Yuan: Zhang Yingming Was Fooled and Is Now Suspected</h3>
<p>Zhang Yingming, an elderly man from Ningbo, has been running the Yingming tooth-setting shop at the mouth of Tangjia Lane on North Zhejiang Road near the Old Garbage Bridge for many years. Recently, Zhang was introduced to a Japanese ronin living in Shanghai by Li Yutang, and they became quite close. What kind of business they were engaged in, outsiders could not know. The day before yesterday, at 4:00 PM, four Japanese and two Chinese people came to Zhang's shop. They gave him several paper packages. Zhang took one package outside, and the rest were hidden upstairs by his family. The Japanese and Chinese people initially stayed in the shop to wait for Zhang, but later left on their own. At 8:00 PM that evening, Zhang suddenly sent Li Yutang to report to the Hongkou Police Station, saying that after he left the shop, these people went to the kitchen, took a knife, destroyed his iron box, and stole 420 yuan. Later, he learned of this upon his return, and went to No. 10 Jiuyu Lane on Yalu Road to look for the Japanese man he knew, but was unable to find him. Therefore, he specially reported the incident for investigation. However, at the time, Zhang's concubine, Zhang Zhou, had detained one of the two Chinese people, but then released him. The police chief, knowing that Zhang's shop was under the jurisdiction of the Mixed Court Police Station, transferred the case to Detective Tao Afu of the Mixed Court Police Station, who went to Zhang's shop for questioning. He suspected that Zhang might be colluding with the Japanese in illegal trade. He searched the shop and found five packages of a substance resembling morphine upstairs, weighing eight and a half pounds. He then took Zhang, his concubine Zhang Zhou, and Li Yutang to the police station. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Tingqi conducted a preliminary hearing. Police lawyer Li Zhishan stated the circumstances of Zhang's and Li's report to the police and the detectives' investigation. Because it was still necessary to test whether the seized substance was morphine, he requested a postponement. Zhang then testified that the Japanese man was introduced to him by Li. He had asked about the powder used for tooth-setting, saying that he was also in the business. Yesterday, he brought several packages of powder to sell to him. Because he did not know the quality of the substance, he took a package to the Caishi Road in the French Concession to ask a colleague to examine it. He did not expect that it would turn out to be flour disguised as powder. When he returned and learned of the incident, he went to find the Japanese man to negotiate, but could not find him. Therefore, he reported the incident to the police. The seized substance belonged to the Japanese man and could be tested. If it turned out to be morphine, he would willingly admit his guilt. Lawyer Li said that according to Zhang's testimony, it seemed that he was also being fooled by someone. He requested bail, and the police did not object. Judge Wu then ordered Zhang Yingming and Zhang Zhou to be released on bail, while Li Yutang was remanded in custody pending the results of the testing.</p>
<p>The Winner of the Grand Champagne First Prize</p>
<h3>Shared by Over Twenty People: The Elderly Given Funds to Remarry, the Youngest Only Sixteen Years Old, Everyone Benefited</h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that the number of the Grand Champagne first prize in the horse race, 12190, was heard today (12th) to have been won by twenty carpenters. These people only bought one lottery ticket, with each person contributing mostly two and a half dimes or five dimes, at most one yuan. Yet they won one of the two first prizes, totaling 100,2905 yuan. The names of the people are being kept strictly secret to prevent accidents. It was only heard that five of them were employees of the Luo Ban Chen Piano Store on Nanjing Road, and they shared the prize money of over 30,000 yuan. One person has already left the company today, while the other four are still working as usual. It was also heard that one of them is over fifty years old and has been working at the piano store for many years. He has long desired to remarry to comfort his twilight years. Now that he has the funds, he can fulfill his wishes, gaining both a person and wealth. He can be said to be having good luck in his old age. As for the remaining fifteen people, it was heard that most of them live in Zhabei. They suffered heavy losses during the Shanghai war last year. The youngest among them is only sixteen years old. This prize money can be used for compensation.</p>
<p>Major Search in Baoyuli</p>
<h3>Due to Anonymous Letters, Forty to Fifty People Were Detained</h3>
<p>The Dazimingzhong Police Station in the French Concession has recently received more than ten anonymous letters. The content of the letters mainly stated that there were kidnapping organizations in Baoyuli, as well as opium dens and gambling dens, and that thieves were hiding in hotels and inns. Therefore, the police chief acted discreetly and dispatched additional Chinese and French detectives on regular duty, as well as a large number of Vietnamese, Russian, and Chinese police, totaling over a hundred people, to tightly surround the entrances of each lane in Baoyuli. Yesterday (12th) morning at 6:00 AM, the Chinese and French detectives searched each household. All the shops along the roads, such as Caishi Street along the south of Baoyuli, Avenue Edward VII along the north, and Dongxinqiao Street along the east, as well as the residents in the lane, totaling over a hundred houses, were all searched. The search lasted for two hours. During the search, pedestrians in the lane were not allowed to enter or exit. The search ended at around 8:00 AM. As a result, over fifty or sixty opium pipes, opium dross, small bore guns, and various opium paraphernalia, opium paste, opium ashes, and red pills were seized. The most red pills and opium pipes were found in the Anle No. 2 Inn. Suspected thieves and opium gamblers, totaling forty to fifty people, were arrested, fully loaded into two trucks, and taken to the police station to report to the police chief for further investigation. During the search, most of the residents were fast asleep and were awakened from their dreams. At that time, vegetables were being sold on Caishi Street, and a large number of armed police surrounded Baoyuli on three sides, not allowing pedestrians to enter or exit. The situation was quite serious. When the search was completed, the detectives withdrew their forces, and Caishi Street returned to its original state.</p>

<h3>Mr. Li Gongpu's Speech on National Humiliation Week: My Views on the Future of Sino-Japanese Relations</h3>
<p>May 9th at the YMCA</p>
<p>Friends, the topic I am going to discuss today is my view on the future of Sino-Japanese relations. We know that the relationship between China and Japan did not start today. It has a long history dating back to the 21st year of the Guangxu reign. We remember what Mr. Cai Zimin said the day before yesterday in his speech "Japan's Policy Toward China"—he mentioned that from Japan's annexation of Taiwan and occupation of Korea to its current further creation of puppet states, it is still the old trick of annexing Korea. However, before the "May Fourth Movement," everyone felt a sense of national doom. After the "May Fourth Movement" until the "September 18th Incident," this fear seemed to have diminished, because this is a natural phenomenon of the Chinese people being bound by deeply rooted autocratic systems, intellectual traditions, and family concepts. Although the people's spirit after the "May Fourth Movement" had changed somewhat, it was revitalized during the September 18th Incident. Everyone thought that imperialists did not benefit much from having colonies. In the trend of the times, it was believed that imperialists only wanted economic aggression and not territorial aggression. Of course, the ignorant and uneducated would not understand this, and even the educated were infected by laziness and became lost in a dream. When the September 18th Incident occurred the year before last, most people still did not think that it was a fundamental issue of national survival, but rather that Zhang Xueliang had messed it up. The reason for these views was that everyone had not suffered deeply before the January 28th Incident, so after the January 28th Incident and before the loss of Rehe, the people were unusually decadent. After the loss of Rehe, when the Japanese army captured Shanhaiguan, attacked Qinhuangdao, and approached Beiping and Tianjin, the crisis increased daily. Only then did people realize that the past so-called imperialism was not territorial aggression, and that the various complacent and erroneous psychologies that China would not perish were proven wrong. Now, let's explain the situation from three aspects: Japan's situation, the international situation, and China's current situation. Then we can infer the future of Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>Japan's situation can also be analyzed from three points: 1. Politics: After Japan's military success, it continued with active construction, such as governing Korea and Taiwan very well with decisive force after occupying them, so as to compensate for the losses during the war. From Japan's point of view, it is definitely an undeniable fact that governing the Northeast well recently is beneficial to itself. Also, Japan is a country with mixed ideologies, especially narrow nationalism. Tanaka's policies and the people's fanaticism all support the realization of imperialism, which can enrich military, popular, and political power. 2. Economy: Chinese scholars often like to point out the danger of Japan's economic crisis, but it should be known that Japan's economic crisis was not caused by the invasion of China. For example, the United States is the richest country, yet it still experienced an economic crisis, and at the same time, countries such as Britain and France were affected by it, so Japan's economic crisis is also global. Although its market will inevitably suffer losses after a war, it can immediately restore the market by conquering a piece of land and compensate for the losses of the war. If Japan occupies the Northeast, everything can be better than under Zhang Xueliang. The public sale of opium can eliminate exploitation. In the past, opium was expensive, but now it is cheap. As for whether it is good or bad for everyone after consuming it, that is another question. The purpose is only to gain the trust of Chinese capitalists, and at the same time, raw materials can also be increased. Wherever it gets, it gets the products of that place. Although I have not seen the Northeast with my own eyes, I can know from the contents of the "Manchukuo Yearbook" recently published by the Japanese for the puppet state that the Japanese have been able to achieve the benefits of economic recovery by organizing mineral production, railways, and other things. This is one example. 3. "National Defense": Japan's national defense can be divided into internal and external aspects. Internally, if there is an attack from the air, can it be defended against? During the European War, London was threatened and bombed by German aircraft and felt panicked. The power of the air force now is more advanced than during the European War, so Japan's national defense can never be completely safe, because who dares to say that they have adequate defenses against aviation? Therefore, to keep the sea defense from Tokyo to Korea, it is necessary to expand the land. Externally, if a protracted war is to be fought, materials must be enriched. However, Japan is not enough, and neither is Korea, so it must expand its land to enrich its materials. In summary, Japan has the necessity to invade land.</p>
<p>In the international arena, the relationship of various countries with China is different from that of Japan. In the international arena, China is a part of the aggression, while for Japan, China is the only target of aggression that is most closely related. Such means of violent aggression and bullying of small and weak nations were the usual tricks of past imperialists, so this time, the international community will not be able to use justice to restrain Japan except by stopping it with force, because Japan can use the fact that various countries are also invading China as an excuse. Recently, judging from the public opinion of various countries, Japanese publications have expressed the affection of the United States for Japan and said that no one in the United States opposes Japan's economic aggression in Manchuria and Mongolia. They also quoted the words of Wilson, the head of the National YMCA, the Secretary of War under President Wilson, and the leader of the Civil Rights Party, Newton Baker, expressing sympathy for Japan's small land area and large population. Although some people say that the Japanese words cannot be trusted, the fact that Japan has a small land area and a large population is well known to the powers and is something we should know. At the Pacific Conference, Japan always mentions the population problem, because at least this way it can gain the sympathy of the world. The other day, a Reuters dispatch from London reported that Professor R. H. Tawney, an economic historian at the University of London, said in a speech at a certain school: "China should immediately rise up and take action, otherwise foreign aggression will take its place. China's chaos has lasted for 30 years and has not stopped, which is really pessimistic. When he was in China, Shenyang had already been lost, and the Chinese people only expressed anger and did not take any action, which really showed the patience of the Chinese people. If the League of Nations had taken decisive action earlier, Japan would not have dared to seize all of Manchuria." The above shows a glimpse of the international attitude towards China and Japan. Therefore, since the Sino-Japanese incident occurred, the simultaneous resignation of the three Chinese ministers is a clear point.</p>
<p>Regarding China, Mr. Zhang Yousan said the other day that there are five ways: fighting, negotiating peace, resisting, relying [on others], and delaying. Except for the last one, which is not a way at all, but are the previous ones really ways? Think about it: if you can't fight, then fighting is not a way; if you can't negotiate peace, then negotiating peace is certainly not a way. Where is there a real way in all of this? Regarding the recent battle against Japan along the Great Wall after the loss of Rehe, the knowledgeable are indifferent to this national war. As for those who can help the soldiers and care about them, they are mostly hardworking farmers. Furthermore, when the Japanese diplomat Yosuke Matsuoka returned home and was enthusiastically welcomed by many people, he severely criticized his countrymen, saying that a large portion of them did not know how dangerous the situation the country was in. We see that Japanese diplomats encourage the people in this way, but how many people in China are willing to point out mistakes? There is no overall plan, nor is there a unanimous expression from the government and the public. Some people say that the people have not yet awakened, but if the people do not rise up to save themselves now, it will be difficult to save the country when it is lost in the future. In the Korean restoration movement, there is a story that can serve as a warning to us. When it started in 1919, the European War had ended, and various countries were holding a peace conference in Paris. The Koreans thought that the time had come. In the first month of that year, the national Bible study meeting was held as usual. Pastor Kim Pil-mo used the name of selling church newspapers to travel around the churches and secretly contacted the leaders, and agreed to hold a demonstration at 2:00 pm on March 2nd, because March 3rd was the funeral day of King Lee Tae of Korea. People from all provinces and counties gathered to attend the funeral, intending to take the opportunity to arouse the national spirit of shared hatred. At that time, Korea also had the so-called Cheondoist religion, whose leader, Son Dong-hee, had the ambition to restore the country. His followers exceeded one million. He joined forces with Kim Pil-mo to start the uprising. The schools in the church and the schools outside the church first united, pre-printed flyers, and widely prepared national flags. On March 2nd, the leaders of various churches specially held a citizens' meeting at Taehwagwan in Seoul, with tens of thousands of people attending. They raised the Taegeuk national flag and held a cordial ceremony. The leaders gave heartfelt speeches and immediately wrote to the Governor-General of Korea, Hasegawa Yoshimichi, saying, "Our sacred Korean people advocate freedom and independence in this enlightened era. From now on, you can quickly return to your country and do not hurt the harmony of the people of the two countries." The Governor-General was shocked and immediately imposed martial law as if facing a formidable enemy, dispatching dozens of cars and armed forces to arrest the leaders. The leaders were kind and friendly, and shouted, "We have not finished speaking yet, please wait a moment," and continued to speak calmly, distributing flyers to the masses, saluting the national flag, and shouting "Long live independence" three times, and then calmly went to be arrested, a total of 33 people. Jesus pastor, Gu Seon-ju, Choi Seong-mo, Cheondoist leader Son Byeong-hee, Oh Se-chang, and Yang Han-muk were among the most famous. The Japanese thought that nothing would happen after capturing the leaders, but unexpectedly, three days later, the whole of Korea was shaken. Every household had the Taegeuk national flag, and everyone shouted "Long live independence." Demonstrations spread throughout the 13 provinces and more than 360 counties. Children and women also marched in teams, shouting "Return our mountains and rivers, national self-determination." Arrests and executions followed one after another. First, Kim Gyu-sik, a plenipotentiary representative, was sent to the Paris Peace Conference to petition. On April 12, with the approval of the four countries, he submitted a petition for independence. Overseas Chinese sent letters and telegrams everywhere to seek assistance. On April 17, a provisional government was organized, with members including Syngman Rhee, Kim Gyu-sik, An Chang-ho, Yi Dong-hwi, Choi Jae-hyeong, Mun Chang-beom, Yi Si-yeong, and Yi Dong-nyeong. On May 12, the United States recognized Syngman Rhee as the ambassador to the United States and allowed the Independence Hall in Washington to host him. The Japanese saw that the situation was getting worse and worse and extremely dangerous, so they mobilized the military and police to carry out massacres, roasting people naked, nailing their feet, dissecting their bellies, burying three or five people alive, or destroying entire villages. From March to June, about 30,000 people were brutally killed, more than 2,000 women, and more than 10,000 people were imprisoned. Let us think about it. Under the strict surveillance of the Japanese, the national spirit of struggle that was created with one or twenty years of effort can make tens of thousands of men, women, old and young compatriots disregard life and death and fight for the survival of the motherland. How great is this spirit? However, once it is suppressed by supreme violence, it is almost completely wiped out in two or three months. From this point of view, we know how difficult and arduous the restoration after national subjugation is!</p>
<p>Based on the above analysis and personal observation, I speculate that the future of Sino-Japanese relations will be no more than two possibilities: (1) International co-management. Some people think that international co-management will cause a second world war, but that is not the case, because international co-management is not all the powers gathering together, opening the map of China, and dividing it carefully. Instead, before the Second World War, the powers must find ways to avoid a world war. On the surface, they still maintain a peaceful attitude, but in reality, they go a step further than now, using internal wars, with an imperialist power behind each warlord, to create a country that is seemingly divided but not divided, seemingly unified but not unified.</p>
<p>(2) National self-awakening and self-salvation, and cooperation with the government. What the government dares not do is the government's lack of power, which is also the people's lack of power. Let me give you an example. For example, "peace" should be negotiated after the fall of Shenyang and before the loss of Jinzhou, but who would dare to say this at that time? If such a powerful person came out at that time to advocate it and the government did not listen, I am afraid that the government would have been overthrown long ago. It is the same now. For example, some people say that this is what the government does not allow, not that the people have no power. Then let me ask, are "bandits" allowed by the government? You must know that if the people know how to save themselves and rise up automatically, then the government cannot interfere. During the "January 28th Incident" last year, the Shanghai people enthusiastically helped the 19th Route Army. Was this instigated by the government? Therefore, the people should cultivate and train their own strength to supervise the government, because maintaining social order is the government's intention, but we cannot expect the current government to deal with Japan in a strong manner. If we people feel that the fire is already burning our eyebrows, we should fight Japan at all costs. Then the people of all provinces and regions should automatically rise up to urge the government to resist Japan. For example, when Roosevelt was appointed during this economic crisis, Congress unprecedentedly granted the president many special powers, but when it came to solving the war debt problem, many leaders came out to express their opposition to extending the debt. This opinion made Roosevelt have to be wary of the war debt issue. You must know that looking at China's political history, it has been deeply inertial, and there is no resistance to foreign aggression. Moreover, China is an agricultural economic self-sufficient country, which is far from being able to compete with scientific and industrial countries. However, the Chinese national character inherently contains the characteristics of courage, simplicity, hard work, and endurance to extreme oppression. If it can be closely united, it will surely be able to forge its own way out of difficult circumstances. Therefore, the last hope is that the people of all regions cultivate strength, train their own spirit, organize groups, and cooperate with the government. If this step can be achieved, then any government that is not right can be overthrown. If the people do not know how to save themselves, they will surely be eliminated. Do not blame the government alone. We must recognize that cultivation, training, and organization are the only work we should do. (Recorded by Xu Zhi)</p>

<h3>Important News</h3>
<p>Jiangsu Education Fees to Be Issued for One Month Before the Summer Festival</p>
<p>When the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office held a meeting of auditors on the afternoon of the 10th, it reported that the current treasury balance was over 120,000 yuan. Previously issued payment notices that had not yet been cashed amounted to over 190,000 yuan. After offsetting income and expenses, there was still a shortage of over 70,000 yuan. They are now urging various counties to remit education fees in order to clear the already issued payment notices. As the Summer Festival is approaching and various schools need funds urgently, the auditors approved the issuance of payment notices for the full month of February (with rural teachers and experimental primary schools continuing to follow the usual practice). These notices will be issued before the 20th of this month, and schools will receive the funds before the 25th to meet the expenses of the Summer Festival.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Explains the Supplementary Examination Issue After the Graduation Examination</h3>
<p>▲Instruction to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, in response to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education's request for clarification on three points regarding supplementary examinations for senior high school general studies students after the graduation examination, specifically instructed the bureau as follows: "Received and understood. Students who participate in the secondary school student graduation examination retest and still fail in one or two subjects should comply with Article 9 of the Provisional Regulations for Secondary and Primary School Student Graduation Examinations and study for an additional year. Remedial studies can be done in or outside the school. If the distance between the current examination and the next is only one semester, the remedial period for these students is allowed to be shortened to one semester. Senior high school students without graduation qualifications may not apply to universities. Students who fail the retest have not obtained senior high school graduation qualifications and are not allowed to apply to universities. The secondary and primary school graduation examination is to determine the graduation grades of secondary and primary school students and promote the efficiency of secondary and primary school education, and is not an entrance examination. Therefore, senior high school graduates with excellent graduation examination results may not be exempt from the university entrance examination. Scholarship amounts are a kind of reward and relief method for schools to students who have excellent academic performance or poor family backgrounds, and have nothing to do with the graduation examination. Therefore, scholarships cannot be given due to excellent graduation examination results. Please comply accordingly."</p>
<h3>Jinling Women's University Patriotic Fundraising Carnival</h3>

They eat vegetarian food on the 18th of each month to commemorate the national disaster. After class, they often train in first aid work or go to neighboring communities to spread the word about the national crisis. Recently, they have planned a patriotic fundraising carnival to spread the word about the awareness that the people should have during the national crisis, and will donate all ticket proceeds to the front lines. Preparations are now complete and it is scheduled to be held at the school this Saturday. There will be a national goods and Japanese goods exhibition, anti-Japanese bloody battle films, anti-Japanese speech competitions by Nanjing elementary school students, and sports performances.

<h3>University Students Jointly Telegraph He Yingqin to Order Frontline Troops to Actively Counterattack</h3>
<p>▲ To Make the Enemy Have Concerns Elsewhere</p>
<p>▲ To Achieve the Effect of Surprise Attacks</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Students' Federation telegraphed He Yingqin yesterday, requesting him to order the frontline troops to actively counterattack. The original telegram is as follows: "Respectful salutations to Minister He Yingqin of Beiping. The violent Japanese are rampant and their advances are endless. The war in Eastern Hebei is also urgent. With resolute resistance, the central government has already made a decision to turn danger into safety, and you must have already made calculations. However, resistance is not for passivity, and war cannot be passive. We dare to ask you to make a decisive decision and order the frontline troops to actively counterattack, so that the enemy has concerns elsewhere, and we achieve the effect of surprise attacks. Otherwise, only talking about resistance when the enemy comes, and only looking after one's own when the enemy leaves, with each corner and each region fighting on its own, will give the enemy the convenience of defeating them one by one. Then the four northeastern provinces will never be recovered. The survival of the nation depends on moments. We hope you will urgently plan for it. Shanghai University Students' Federation bows."</p>

<p>Jiangnan University Sports Meet Opens Yesterday</p>
<p>Tense Championship Situation</p>
<p>Field Events: Datong and Central Become Rivals</p>
<p>Track Events: Guanghua and Central Have Fierce Competition</p>
<h3>Five Records Broken; Women's Group Starts Today</h3>
<p>The 6th Jiangnan Eight Universities Athletics Meet opened yesterday afternoon at the Jiaotong University athletics field in Xujiahui. After a day of competition, the two men's athletics championships are trending towards a relative rivalry. Datong is superior in field events, Guanghua is dominant in track events, and Central is chasing from behind. The championships will not go beyond these three schools. Five records were broken. The women's athletics competition started today. Central is certain to win. The only regret in the field yesterday was the internal problem at Fudan, which temporarily stopped them from participating in the competition.</p>
<h3>Grand Opening</h3>
<p>▲Parade Circumstances At 1:00 PM, the opening ceremony was held. Staff and athletes gathered under the "Gate of Health" tower at the entrance of the sports field, led by the orphanage band in a parade around the field for a week. Following the band were all the staff, the schools in the following order: (1) Datong, (2) Central, (3) Guanghua, (4) Jinling, (5) Chihchih, (6) Fudan, (7) Jinan, (8) Jiaotong. Each school had one person holding the school flag in front, with a distance of about ten yards between each school. The steps were neat, and the parade was spectacular. The flag bearer for Guanghua was female athlete Ms. Jiang Yin Yue, presumably to show respect for women's rights.</p>
<p>▲A Glimpse of Costumes The costumes of the athletes from each school were most neat and tidy at Central and Jiaotong. Central wore blue cloth trousers and white flannel shirts, while Jiaotong wore white shorts and blue flannel shirts, extremely simple and elegant. The other schools were a mixed army, colorful and inconsistent.</p>
<p>▲Li's Speech After the parade, they lined up in front of the podium to hold the opening ceremony. After performing the rituals, Honorary President Li Zhaohuan gave the opening speech, welcoming the athletes from all schools to participate, hoping to promote the true spirit of sports, create excellent results, and achieve the meaning of strengthening the race and strengthening the country.</p>
<p>▲Athlete Oath Next, Liu Fukang, captain of the Jiaotong University track and field team, took the oath on behalf of all athletes. At that time, the flag bearers of each school stood around the podium, and Mr. Liu was in the middle, raising his right hand to take the oath: "We are participating in this Jiangnan Eight Universities Athletics Meet, and we swear to abide by the rules of the venue, promote the spirit of sports, compete sincerely, bring glory to the school, and add color to sports. This oath."</p>
<h3>Fudan Absent</h3>
<p>Fudan University's track and field team has many talented people and excellent results. It had originally signed up to participate, but yesterday it was only seen participating in the parade and opening ceremony and did not send athletes to compete. Everyone was surprised. After inquiring with a certain athlete from Fudan, it was said that a problem occurred in the team, and they could not participate in the competition, but they were deeply afraid of causing misunderstanding among the Jiangda Association, so they participated in the opening ceremony.</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Scores for Each School</h3>
<p>▲Field Events (Men)</p>
<p>Datong University 13 points Central University 11 points</p>
<p>Guanghua University 6 points Jiaotong University 2 points</p>

<h3>Championship Situation</h3>
<p>Fudan Temporarily Does Not Participate in the Competition</p>
<p>Affects the Overall Situation of the Two Athletics Championships</p>
<p>Central Team's Hopes Suddenly Increase</p>
<p>Based on previous predictions, Central seemed to be in a superior position due to its many and well-rounded talents, but the actual hopes were not very high. Guanghua in track events and Datong in field events definitely possessed strong strength, but things are not always as they seem. Fudan suddenly had internal problems, only participating in the parade and not in the competition. The entire situation will be affected, which is also unexpected. The current situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>▲Guanghua and Central Compete for Track Events The track championship will now become a battle between Guanghua and Central. Guanghua's Dong Shuzhao has already won the 1500 meters, and is confident in the 800 meters and 400 meters. Tao Yingjie can also secure a position in the 400 meters. Wang Jihuai has great hope in the 100 meters and 200 meters. Central's Xu Biao is probably not as good as him. However, Central has more entrants and can get positions. The intermediate hurdles will belong to Tao Yingjie, and the high hurdles will belong to Liu Yingjun. The opportunities and situation for both schools are very equal. The scores already obtained are also 5 points each. However, if Fudan participates, there will be Cheng Jinguan of Fudan in the sprints, and Central will be further behind, and Guanghua will have more grasp. Guanghua or Central? It depends on today.</p>
<p>Wu Jinqi of Datong Wins High Jump (Xu Tianzhang Photo)</p>
<p>▲Datong and Central Compete for Field Events Datong's performance in field events was amazing. Chen Baoqiu won the discus, and Wu Jinqi won the high jump and second place in the long jump, occupying the most superior position with 13 points. Central got 11 points. Tomorrow's javelin and shot put will also be in Datong's bag. However, the triple jump and pole vault are Central's domain, and Datong can only let them have it. The opportunities for both sides are also very equal. However, if Fudan participates, Li Lin will take away a lot of points in the triple jump and pole vault. Datong is greatly hit now.</p>
<p>▲Central Steadily Wins Women's Championship The women's group championship, which starts competing today, will definitely belong to Central, without a doubt. The troops are well-trained, and the talents are abundant. The other teams are not their opponents.</p>
<p>Dong Shuzhao Wins</p>
<h3>1500 Meters</h3>
<p>Sufficient Strength and Good Skills</p>
<p>Breaks Jiangda Record</p>
<p>▲Hu Shixuan Leads the Way The only final of the track event, the 1500 meters, had sixteen people lined up to start. After the gun fired, Central's Hu Shixuan immediately took the lead, leaping forward and leading the way. The first lap formed a straight line, with Hu in the lead and Guanghua's Dong Shuzhao closely following. The distance behind the second lap increased. Hu Shixuan was still in front with extremely brisk steps, while Dong kept his pace and stayed behind him. The third person was Wang Fengting of Jinling. The third lap was the last one, and the top three were the same as before, while Central's Lin Xuan had intensified his pace and caught up to fourth place, slightly behind Wang.</p>
<p>▲Dong Shuzhao's Sprint Was Fierce After the third lap passed, the victory or defeat would be decided in the last 300 meters. The competition between Hu and Dong had become a close-quarters battle. About 150 meters from the finish line, Dong Shuzhao began to accelerate, passing Hu Shixuan and sprinting forward all the way to the end, with applause rising everywhere. Hu Shixuan was surprised by the unexpected event, and his strength was not enough to follow, reaching the finish line more than 20 meters apart. Judging from Dong's strength, it exceeded this. It is feared that he knew Hu was strong and dared not take risks, and his skills were commendable. The result was four minutes, thirty-six seconds, and five-twelfths, breaking the Jiangda record. Hu was second, and Central's Lin Xuan caught up to third, and Jinling's Wang Fengting got one point.</p>
<p>Field Event Finals</p>
<h3>Chen Baoqiu Sets New Discus Record</h3>
<p>Yesterday's field event finals had a total of three events. Chen Baoqiu won first place in the discus with a throw of 35.06 meters, setting a new Jiangda record. Wu Jinqi won first place in the high jump with a result of 1.69 meters, a significant regression. Wang Jihuai's long jump of 6.64 meters was still good.</p>
<p>▲Discus The first final was the discus. As a result of the preliminaries, Chen Baoqiu (Datong), Zhang Jiechun (Central), Zhong Jiqing (Central), Yin Shimin (Central), Xu Biao (Central), and Du Shuzhen of Jinling were selected. The best result was Chen Baoqiu's 34.81 meters. The results of the finals were all improved, and Chen Baoqiu relied on the last throw to break the Jiangda record with 35.06 meters, but it was still far from Zhou Lianzeng's national record of 36.50 meters. According to Datong instructor Shen Dingnan, Chen usually throws as far as 37-38 meters. The remaining three were all from Central. Jinling's Du Shuzhen finished fifth with 30.16 meters. The results of each person are as follows:</p>
<p>First Chen Baoqiu (Datong) 35.06 meters</p>
<p>(New Jiangda Record)</p>
<p>Second Zhang Jiechun (Central) 31.38 meters</p>
<p>Third Zhong Jiqing (Central) 30.55 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Yin Xiamin (Central) 30.22 meters</p>
<p>▲Long Jump The second event was the long jump. In the first jump of the opening, Central's Liu Yingjun got 6.52 meters. Guanghua's famous player Wang Jihuai did not touch in the first try, and jumped to 6.64 meters in the second jump. Liu Yingjun once jumped to about 6.80 meters, but unfortunately it was ruled out of bounds. Afterwards, according to a referee, this jump was not out of bounds. Then it is a pity for Mr. Liu, otherwise he would have created a new national record. Wu Jinqi of Datong, who was selected in the preliminaries, had the worst result among the six, but in the finals, he jumped to 6.62 meters in the second jump, jumping to second place, which can be said to be extremely fortunate. The results of the four people who scored are as follows:</p>

<h3>Preliminary Notes</h3>
<p>(1) 100 Meters (Men) The preliminaries were temporarily divided into two groups, with eight people in each group. There was a slight wind, but it was blocked by the houses on the left side of the track, and the impact was small. In the first group, (1) Chen Jiayou of Jinan, (2) Xu Biao of Central, and (3) Zheng Wenzhu of Jiaotong were about one meter apart. The result was 14.4 seconds, equal to the Jiangda record. In the second group, (1) Huang Feilong of Jinan, (2) Lu Linyu of Central, and (3) Wang Jihuai of Guanghua arrived almost at the same time, only a shoulder apart. The result was very good, 11.2 seconds, breaking the Jiangda record. The finals today will be fiercely competitive and worth watching.</p>
<p>(2) 200 Meters (Men) It was also temporarily merged into two groups. In the first group, (1) Xu Biao, (2) Huang Feilong, and (3) Zheng Wenzhu of Jiaotong competed fiercely and arrived almost at the same time, with very slight differences. The result was 24.6 seconds, mediocre. The result of the second group was very good, 23.6 seconds, breaking the Jiangda record, and the front section of the track had to turn. (1) Chen Jiayou, chased out Ma Yu of Central in the last 30 meters. (3) Wang Jihuai and Ma were not far apart.</p>
<p>(3) 400 Meters (Men) The preliminaries were divided into two groups. In the first group, (1) Dong Shuzhao of Guanghua won very easily. (2) Wu Zhaochu of Jiaotong was more than 5 meters behind. Dong has a high hope of winning the championship in the finals. The result was 50.6 seconds. In the second group, Liu, Ma, and Tao were not far apart in the first, second, and third places. Tao Yingjie found it difficult to exert his strength after the 400-meter intermediate hurdles preliminaries. The result of this group was 56.2 seconds.</p>
<p>(4) High Hurdles (Men) Divided into two groups. In the first group, Liu Yingjun of Central led all the way, and the result was 17 seconds, breaking the Jiangda record. Liu was said to have a result of 10 meters in Nanjing. The highest hope for the finals is Liu. In the second group, Chen Jiayou was first, also leading all the way, or 17.5 seconds.</p>
<p>(5) Intermediate Hurdles (Men) Divided into two groups. The first Zhu Shouxun of Central and the first Tao Yingjie of Guanghua in the second group left the people behind by seven or eight meters, writing and meaning, and Tao also smiled and waved to people, not striving for results, presumably saving strength for the 400-meter preliminaries.</p>

<h3>Venue Notes</h3>
<p>▲Auntie Wind Acts Up Yesterday, there was a strong wind, which was even more unbearable in the vast sports field. The competition also felt difficult. Therefore, there were few spectators. There were 400-500 people in the two-corner ticket stands. At the end of the north gate of the field, there were only a hundred people watching. Because of the strong wind and the cool weather, the soda stalls had no business at all.</p>
<p>▲On the Podium The podium is located at the west end of the field outside the track and has a large area and a very strong structure. To the left is the military band stand, in the middle is the office table, and to the right is the staff lounge and press seats. The four weeks are surrounded by yellow and green cloth, which is quite elegant. The school flags of the eight schools stand in front of the stage, flying in the wind, which is extremely eye-catching. Distilled water is specially prepared on the stage for the staff to drink.</p>
<p>▲Female Athletes There are more than twenty female athletes in total, the most from Central and the least from Jiaotong. Five female players from a certain school have long hair draped over their shoulders, which is extremely modern. Beautiful ladies lack the spirit of perseverance and courage. If you want to seek the development of women's sports like this, the Shandong big girls can retreat three times.</p>
<p>▲Broadcasting Equipment The entire field is specially equipped with a broadcasting machine, and the sound reaches the athletes' rest area. This broadcasting machine is installed by the Standard Sports Company in Laoximen.</p>

<p>China Education Sports Federation Small Football Match</p>
<h3>The Nationalist Gains Championship</h3>
<p>▲Defeated Shanghai High and Pudong High</p>
<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation holds a small football competition every year. This year, due to the regulation that players' weight must not exceed 100 pounds, only Minli, Shanghai High, and Pudong High schools participated. The competition uses a single round-robin system, with points determining the championship. The competition venue is at the Shanghai First Sports Field, and Zhang Longhai is invited to referee all matches. On the 11th, Minli defeated Shanghai High with a score of 2-0. On the 12th, Minli again defeated Pudong High with a score of 2-0. Chen Jincan, the backbone of Minli, is a well-known figure in the small football world, leading the way and being invincible. His continuous achievements are not accidental. It is said that this afternoon at 3 o'clock, there will be a match between Shanghai High and Pudong High, but no matter who wins or loses, the championship already belongs to Minli.</p>

<h3>Multiple Radios Use One Antenna</h3>
<p>— Zhong Qin</p>
<p>In the wireless radio field, although antennas are extremely disliked, and various methods are sought to avoid installing them, it is universally acknowledged that antennas should not be avoided simply because they are troublesome. So far, no inventor in the wireless radio field has discovered an absolutely foolproof method to eliminate antennas. If more than one radio is installed in public places or hotels, wouldn't it require installing many antennas? The wireless radio community has been discussing how to avoid this difficulty for a long time without finding a perfect solution.</p>
<p>Recently, this long-debated problem has gradually reached a conclusion: the first way to avoid installing multiple antennas is to have several radios share one antenna. In other words, one antenna is responsible for receiving radio waves for multiple radios. This is the only method, and it is gradually being improved and will eventually be realized.</p>
<p>Having one antenna responsible for receiving radio waves from the air for multiple radios is not very precise. This was the conclusion drawn from initial experiments. Because multiple radios each receive radio waves of different wavelengths, the branching is very complex. In the initial test, using two radios with one antenna did not yield good results and was difficult to adjust. Lengthening the antenna did not improve the performance. Later, a capacitor with a capacitance of approximately 0.0002 was added between the antenna and the ground, and the results improved significantly. After testing with two radios, then three, then four, a general conclusion was reached: the number of radios sharing one antenna for receiving radio waves must be limited. However, the standard for determining this limit has not yet been determined. Initially, the only limit was five radios sharing a 20-foot-long antenna. If six radios were used, no sound could be received. Also, the wavelength limit is related to the number of radios. In the initial experiments, five six-tube radios sharing one antenna could only receive radio waves within a range of 200 to 600 meters. The reason for this is still unclear.</p>
<p>Later, through gradual improvement and research, a British radio expert increased the number of radios to fifty, all sharing one antenna, and the results were excellent. Because removing the antenna halved the sound volume, while installing it doubled the volume and increased the range, it proved that he had truly succeeded. His method also involved adding a capacitor between the antenna and the ground, but the antenna was relatively high. Philips has now hired this radio expert as an engineer, and he is still making improvements. Perhaps there will be even more surprising developments in the future!</p>
<h3>Wiring of Center-Tapped Resistors</h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Center-tapped resistors should be directly connected to the filaments (as shown in Figure A). If they are connected to the output of the power transformer (as shown in Figure B), even if the two wires AB are slightly different in length, the voltage at both ends will be unbalanced, which can easily cause AC hum. Similarly, using the center tap of the power transformer without using a center-tapped resistor can also cause the same problem. Also, the filament regulator of an AC radio should be connected before the center-tapped resistor (as shown in Figure C). A table of center-tapped resistors for various vacuum tubes is attached below:</p>
<h3>Notice for Radio Operators (1) ()</h3>
<p>— Ti Gan</p>
<p>Procedures for Radio Communication</p>
<p>(1) All communication times specified by the Radio Administration Bureau must be strictly observed and not delayed.</p>
<p>(2) When it is time for Station A and Station B to communicate, they should call each other promptly. In the case of simplex stations, one side must call while the other listens. If Station B hears the signal from Station A, it must wait until Station A has finished calling before replying and requesting that Station A begin transmitting. In the case of duplex stations, which can transmit and receive simultaneously, both sides should listen while calling to avoid delays.</p>
<p>(3) If Station A calls Station B, and there is no response from the other side for a long time, causing a delay in the communication time, it should be recorded in the logbook and reported to the chief radio operator to investigate the cause.</p>
<p>(4) In cases where both sides have difficulty receiving the signal, the wavelength should be changed, and the other party should be notified immediately using a simple phrase to avoid misunderstandings.</p>
<p>(5) If neither Station A nor Station B has any telegrams to transmit during the communication period, they should still monitor each other. If Station A has a significant backlog of telegrams with Station C, Station A can notify Station B to wait temporarily while it communicates with Station C for a certain period.</p>
<p>(6) After the telegram transmission has begun, if the communication time is about to end, the decision to stop or continue transmitting and receiving should be based on the urgency and length of the telegrams.</p>
<p>(7) If Station A still has several urgent telegrams to transmit when the communication between Station A and Station B is about to end, Station A must immediately request that Station B continue monitoring. Station B should continue monitoring for another ten minutes. If further extension is needed, Station B should inquire with Station C, whose communication time is within the scheduled period, to see if an accommodation can be made before making a final decision.</p>
<p>(8) If there are any aspects of the communication time that do not conform to the needs of radio operations, the chief radio operator should report the situation to the Radio Administration Bureau for modification.</p>
<h3>A Cost-Free Morse Code Practice Device</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Radio enthusiasts hate AC hum the most, but here we are using AC hum to create a Morse code practice device.</p>
<p>As shown in the diagram, a cord is wound around the cord of an electric lamp (about twenty or thirty turns). The other end is connected in series with a headset and a telegraph key, and then grounded. When the telegraph key is opened and closed, a pleasant telegraph signal can be heard in the headset.</p>
<h3>Small Experiences</h3>
<p>— Xu Bing</p>
<p>White lines on dials and bakelite panels that have become soiled over time can be cleaned by mixing a small amount of white lead powder with linseed oil to form a thick paste, and then applying it to the lines. After it dries, it will be as clean and white as new.</p>
<p>Using sandpaper to remove the insulation from copper wire is cleaner and less likely to cut the wire than using a knife.</p>
<p>If you want to know the thickness of the copper wire you are using but do not have a wire gauge, you can use the following method to measure it: wind the copper wire you want to measure tightly around a pencil for one inch. After knowing the number of turns per inch, you can look up its gauge and size in a copper wire table (wire tables are found in electrical engineering and radio reference books). For example, if an enameled wire has 17 turns per inch, you can find in the table that it is a No. 15 wire with a diameter of .0589 inches.</p>
<h3>Radio Troubleshooting and Solutions (4)</h3>
<p>— AA</p>
<p>(4) Noise Generation</p>
<p>There are two types of noise: noise generated within the radio itself and noise from external interference. If noise persists even after disconnecting the antenna and ground, it is a problem with the radio itself. Otherwise, it is external interference.</p>
<p>Here, we will focus on examining noise generated within the radio itself.</p>
<p>Noise is a most unwelcome sound that can disrupt excellent programming and spoil enjoyment. If your radio is generating noise, you can try checking it according to the table above.</p>
<p>Next time, we will discuss sound fidelity.</p>
<h3>Domestic and Foreign News</h3>
<p>▲Astonishing News: The most famous US R.C.A. radios have arrived in Shanghai, with models including five-tube, seven-tube, nine-tube, and twelve-tube versions. All are beautifully designed and constructed with the latest vacuum tubes. The reception is distant and clear, with no noise. Satisfaction is guaranteed. Those who have not yet purchased a radio will find that adding one of these will enhance their home life considerably.</p>
<p>▲Ke Rad Radio Vacuum Tubes Arrive in Shanghai: Kangmao Radio Store at No. 47 Ningbo Road has received a large shipment of the most established and renowned American Ke Rad radio vacuum tubes. They are meticulously constructed, durable, power-saving, and offer powerful sound output, making them a new contribution to the radio industry. The shipment is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th of this month, and the store is expected to experience a surge in business.</p>
<p>▲Recent News from Dahua Radio Company: Dahua Radio Company specializes in manufacturing various shortwave transceiver radios, with outstanding performance that has long been recognized by all sectors. Striving for excellence, they have recently launched the new Wuhua Special Shortwave Machine, capable of transmitting and receiving up to 1,000 li. It is reported that a significant number of orders have been placed for this device. The machine is available in both portable and fixed models, featuring an aesthetically pleasing design and robust components. The company also guarantees the reliability of the machine.</p>
<p>▲Popular Sales of Panda Radio: The Panda seven-tube radio is sold by Yada Company at No. 25 Renji Road in Shanghai. Since the arrival of the first batch last month, they have been completely sold out. This is due to the machine's sturdy construction, clear sound filtering, and affordable price. It is reported that a second batch of new products has arrived in Shanghai and is currently on display. Upon hearing this news, people from all walks of life are rushing to place orders. The number of units arriving this time is limited, and those who delay may miss out. It is also reported that the company has imported a large number of Huistong four-tube machines, which are compact, exquisite, and aesthetically pleasing, with rich and rounded sound. Even more surprisingly, the price is extremely low. Originally priced at 140 yuan, they are actually selling for only 120 yuan. Such a low price is rare among four-tube radios. As a result, sales of this radio have been very brisk recently.</p>
<p>▲Another New Radio Repair Shop: Xinya Radio Research Institute, located at No. 116 South Wuxi Road, has been in operation for several years and enjoys a good reputation for repairing and manufacturing radio receivers. They have recently expanded and hired experienced technicians to manufacture radio receivers, charging very low fees. It is said that business has been very brisk recently.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Firefighting</h3>
<p>— Baihe</p>
<p>Casually tossing a cigarette butt, which happened to land in a pile of cotton wool, a spark can start a prairie fire, immediately causing smoke to rise through the roof and flames to soar into the sky. Therefore, the moment I hear a hubbub of voices and chaotic siren wails, I'm frightened to the point where my teeth start chattering, afraid that a fire in a neighbor's house will spread to my own, forcing me to rush out with disheveled hair and hastily donned cap to help put it out. If the fire is still a good distance away from my house, then I don't need to worry, I just squeeze into the crowd and crane my neck to watch. It's not that I like to make a fool of myself, it's just that under heaven, everyone is like this.</p>
<p>Our Shenyang caught a spark, and in one night, it burned down the two provinces of Liaoning and Jilin. The fire was so intense that Heilongjiang in the north and Jinzhou in the south immediately turned into piles of rubble. Then, it burned to Shanhaiguan and the entire territory of Rehe. The fire was extraordinarily fierce, and the neighbors standing by with folded arms were all amazed, praising it as a sight to behold. Later, the fire in northern Manchuria gradually threatened to destroy the Chinese Eastern Railway and spread into Russian territory, so Russia prepared firefighting equipment to block its path. The fire in Shanhaiguan gradually approached the Kailuan Mines along the Beining Railway, so Britain immediately cut off its path. The raging fire, blocked on this route, followed the wind and spread to the corner of Chahar.</p>
<p>When Shenyang first caught fire, China sounded the alarm and sought help from the Geneva fire department. Unexpectedly, the firefighters pushed responsibility onto each other, and no one was willing to take action. Later, they reluctantly took action, but unfortunately, the fire had already spread out of control, and pouring water on it was like pouring oil, making it impossible to extinguish. But this fire was indeed too severe, scorching even those watching it across the Pacific, who couldn't stand it anymore. So the Washington fire department prepared to help the Geneva fire department put out the fire together. Although it's uncertain whether they can put out the fire in one go, I think a fire department, even if it's not very effective, is still better than using buckets to draw water for firefighting. At least it can suppress the fire and gradually extinguish it.</p>
<p>Everyone, watch the fire department put out the fire with folded arms.</p>
<h3>Beauty</h3>
<p>— Cai Lian</p>
<p>Calling a woman beautiful is said to be "red beauty," this phrase is seen in the Emperor Wu of Han's essay: "Wrapped in red beauty yet not made clear," passed down to this day, still with its meaning.</p>
<p>There are very few women who can be called "red beauty", even those recorded in history are few in number. However, who does not want their appearance to surpass others? Who does not want to enjoy the beautiful name of "red beauty"? Precisely because it is so precious, everyone's desire to be a "red beauty" becomes more urgent.</p>
<p>Today's general modern ladies and modern grandmothers have misunderstood the meaning of the two words "red beauty." They think that the meaning of the word "face" is, in the Book of Songs: "Face like a shiny lacquer", interpreted as forehead; in the Book of Rites: "Correct color" interpreted as between the eyebrows, literally, "red beauty" means a red face, thinking that people with red faces can be regarded as red beauties. When girls are shy or frightened, two red clouds occasionally float on their cheeks. Su Shi's poem "Red tide climbs the cheeks, drunk betel nut" this kind of natural grace can indeed make poets sing without end. Unfortunately, it is very temporary, and after shyness or fear, the two red clouds also dissipate. Therefore, in order to keep the red face staying on their faces for a long time, modern women must use artificial methods. What is the artificial method? It is to apply red to the cheeks.</p>
<p>They do not count how old they are? How good is their appearance? Even if their faces are as ugly as yakshas, ​​and as old as Xu Niang, they also learn from others, tightly holding a mirror, applying expensive Parisian powder, and then desperately applying a layer of scarlet rouge, impolitely claiming to be "red beauty."</p>
<p>Since modern women advocate this in cities, naturally village girls will imitate them in the countryside. In this way, in a few years, all women will definitely be "red beauties." Oh, what a grand sight!</p>
<p>As the saying goes: "Red beauty has been ill-fated since ancient times." Since modern women are so presumptuous in claiming to be "red beauty", aren't they afraid of the worries of ill-fatedness?</p>
<h3>Public Cemetery</h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>The black monster that devours life certainly inspires some fear, but even the rows of desolate graves, a mound of yellow earth, cannot but stir up agitation and fear. In the past, the cemeteries privately operated by feudal lords and prime ministers were naturally opulent and magnificent. However, no consideration was given to economic land use. Archways of honor and the erection of stone figures of men and horses often cost millions. Currently, wealthy people also have pre-burial constructions, but these are beyond the imagination of middle-class families. Recently, I participated in the funeral ceremony of a deceased friend and had the opportunity to tour a public cemetery. Because I was one of the members in charge of the funeral arrangements, I went in the morning to prepare a simple hall, carefully examined and observed everything.</p>
<p>Upon entering, there was a funeral home, and next to the funeral home was a small hall. Every few feet, the tomb areas were connected by paved cement walkways that were so clean and flat they were almost reflective. There were green grasses and lush lawns, as well as red flowers and green trees. When we imagine its scenery in the seasons of spring flowers and autumn moons, it makes people want to linger and forget to return. Each tombstone and each pagoda were crafted with ingenuity, with different degrees of exquisiteness. The ornate pagoda tops were even topped with a small angel or a Maitreya-like human god. Analyzing many of the remaining portraits, there were stern fathers, kind mothers, beloved sons, beautiful daughters, youthful beauties, and handsome young men. That day, I saw a woman in her forties bringing her daughter-in-law to sweep the grave of her deceased husband. Holding a bouquet of fresh flowers, she instructed her daughter-in-law to offer them to her husband, and then asked her son to take photos of the tomb pagoda. The three stood side by side and paid their respects, then slowly walked out of the public cemetery, saying, "The empty space on the right is where I will rest in peace. Remember it." The thing that swallowed my friend's life was a yellow monster in disguise. It was brought down from the hearse and carried into the tomb gate by several Boy Scouts. The ceremony was very simple. The pastor prayed, everyone sang two hymns, and then the ceremony was declared complete. We know that baptized Christians always express a clean and silent demeanor everywhere, so a large public cemetery like this, every blade of grass and every leaf, seems to be spotless. Outside the gate, there is the poetic beauty of clear streams and winding paths, and the familiar sounds of chickens and dogs. On the iron fence hangs a small sign that says "Baptist Public Cemetery," which also seems to carry a somber component. This kind of place can only be described as the grave path of the human world and the paradise of the ghost world.</p>
<h3>Humorous Remarks</h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng (Drunk Fool)</p>
<p>Emptying the country with aviation! The government and the people have been shouting the slogan "Saving the country with aviation" for a long time. "Naming the son before he's born," Airplane numbers □□. If those numbers were compiled, it would be quite a sight. However, according to reports on the success of fundraising for aviation funds, it is still far from the planned amount. In particular, wealthy people have donated very little, which is bound to be disappointing. As for the front lines, the enemy planes are committing atrocities, and the suffering of the military and civilians is truly indescribable. Our country's existing air force must be used to suppress bandits and cannot participate in combat. (According to reports, the air force's bombing of Zhu De and Mao Zedong has been quite effective.) And the future air force is not yet known when it can be established. This kind of "saving the country with aviation" is afraid that it will turn into "emptying the country with aviation"!</p>
<p>Be mindful of the national crisis! Now is the moment when the "national crisis is upon us"! But the people in the cities are still playing and enjoying themselves as usual. The entertainment venues everywhere are still full to the brim. It's as if the national crisis, no matter how urgent, has nothing to do with me. The ethnicity of the Yellow Emperor Hua Wei is so bad, I really want to imitate Jia Yi's wailing. However, according to what I think, the mentality of ordinary people is because the national crisis is upon us, clearly it is; the national crisis is still at the beginning. The time is not ripe, and it has not reached the focal point. In case it comes to "be mindful of the national crisis," or "the national crisis is at your feet," then that will be the urgent moment!</p>
<p>Long Novel</p>
<h3>Fourth Company Commander of Northeast China</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Sweet and Bitter Love Affairs Coolly Observed from Two Sides, Rugged Worldly Path Secretly Promised for Three Years</p>
<p>Ji Zhi nodded repeatedly in agreement. Gui Zhi said, "Why don't you have a holiday during the New Year?" Ji Zhi said, "We celebrate the Gregorian calendar New Year, don't you know?" Gui Zhi said, "But then again, there's nothing to do in Haidian, it's better to be in the office doing official business, which can kill time." Ji Zhi smiled and said, "It's always good to rest. It's so windy, running around, it's cold and uncomfortable." These words were all</p>
<p>said to be boring, the two faced each other, not knowing what to do. Gui Zhi did not say he was leaving, and Ji Zhi didn't want to leave him and go home alone. So he smiled and said to him, "The coffee shop is not closed, shall we go have another cup of coffee?" This hit Gui Zhi's fancy, which shows that the words of a confidant are always guessed right, and he smiled and said, "I don't know how to drink coffee, why do you always invite me to drink coffee." Ji Zhi said, "If you don't want to drink coffee, then wait a day..." Gui Zhi, before he finished speaking, said, "It's the New Year, you're inviting me, and I can't refute your words, so I'll accompany you to sit down." As he spoke, he moved his feet and walked first. Ji Zhi looked at him and couldn't tell what he meant, so he had to let him go all the way to the cafe. In this cafe, there were originally only two booths, one inside was already occupied, and the two sat in the booth outside. Ji Zhi sat down and smiled, "I think it's still the old rules, should I order a bowl of lotus root flour for you?" As he said this, he heard someone in the booth next door say, "Huh?" Listening carefully, the sound on that side was silent again. Of course, there was nothing surprising about saying to order a bowl of lotus root flour. Perhaps that "huh" from the people next door wasn't directed at him, so there was no need to pay attention to it. The waiter brought the coffee and lotus root flour, and the two sat facing each other across the table, slowly eating and drinking. Gui Zhi didn't speak, so Ji Zhi didn't say anything either. The room was silent for a while, and Ji Zhi was the first to open his mouth and said, "How was your New Year?" Gui Zhi said, "What's good? On New Year's Eve, I was almost forced to death by the creditors." He said he was poor, and Ji Zhi couldn't comfort him, so he just said faintly, "It's the same in that world." After saying this, they were silent again (68)</p>
<p>Small Gardening</p>
<h3>Summer Flowers</h3>
<p>— Zhu Chuo</p>
<p>"Once the Rubus parvifolius flower blooms, the floral season is over." Indeed, as the roses release their delicate and vibrant petals, all the flowers and trees on the earth have already faded in their green and red hues. Plums, those button-like fruits, are already densely packed on the branches; cherries have reddened, and water caltrop has greened. The flowing light, like water, has already secretly sent away the brilliant spring, replacing it with the youthful beauty of summer. During this transition from spring to summer, there are many flowers that are worth cherishing, like a maiden in her seventeen years of beauty.</p>
<p>The elegant and faint fragrance of orchids gently wafts into the senses, certainly not comparable to the strong and greasy fragrances of perfumes like "4711" or "Tosca"! The orchid truly deserves the title of "national fragrance." As spring fades, families in the Jiangnan region reverently display orchids; before one even steps into the room, the sweet fragrance already envelops the senses. The orchids that bloom in spring include both Cymbidium goeringii and Cymbidium faberi. Cymbidium faberi are mostly sold in the market by people from Shaoxing. Cymbidium goeringii has thinner and fewer leaves, and the types of flowers are also more numerous. The plain heart, plum petal, lotus petal, and black heart varieties of Cymbidium goeringii are all very precious, and their value is naturally very high. Moreover, because orchids are flowers planted in pots, cultivation is not easy. The pot, soil, water, and moss all require meticulous study. A slight mistake can cause them to wither and die.</p>
<p>Peonies truly deserve the reputation of "national beauty." The bowl-sized blossoms are crimson, purplish, and every color imaginable. The color is so vibrant and magnificent that they truly dominate all other flowers. Peonies with black petals are the most precious, followed by green, and red is the most common. The Peide Hall Funeral Home outside the阊 Gate of Suzhou, with its "five-colored peonies," was once very famous, so many tourists carrying wine would come to admire them. But now, after many changes, it is unknown whether the peonies there still have their former glory. The flowering period of peonies is short, and they must be picked immediately after they are in full bloom, otherwise, they will not bloom again next year. Therefore, there is a Suzhou proverb: "Pick peonies three days after Grain Rain," which probably matches the saying "Good flowers don't last long."</p>
<p>Wisteria's clusters of dazzling flowers, like缨絡, hang among the tender green branches, even more crystal clear and dazzling than purple grapes, worthy of lingering admiration. As spring comes to an end, wisteria is truly a lovely flower. In the courtyard of the Fengzhi Guild Hall (Humble Administrator's Garden) in Suzhou, there is an ancient wisteria planted by Wen Zhengming, a famous person of the Ming Dynasty. The vine trunk is gnarled, and the branches are scattered. When it is flowering, it is even more delicately expressing that it is a relic of the sages.</p>
<p>Hydrangeas are as white as snow and as round as balls; hydrangeas truly decorate the gardens of early summer with much magnificent scenery. Although the hydrangea blossoms are so large, if you look closely, they are actually many small flowers clustered together. This can truly be called a flower with a sense of collectivity.</p>
<p>Aglaia odorata and Chloranthus inconspicuus Although their colors are not enough to move people, their faint and fragrant aroma is sweet, pure, and lovely, enough to make people infatuated. These two types of flowers can not only be planted in pots to be displayed indoors, but also be dried and placed in tea leaves to add a light fragrance to the tea. When brewing tea and chatting leisurely, the rich aroma permeates from the cup. Slowly sipping it, one doesn't even need Lu Tong's seven bowls to feel a breeze under the armpits and be like an immortal!</p>
<p>Roses have excellent color, fragrance, and taste. The thorny rose truly lives up to its name. The delicate red color, the rich fragrance, and the petals can not only be soaked in wine, but also mashed and mixed with white sugar to make rose candy and rose jam. Rose candy is certainly sweet and delicious, but the delicate, bright red rose jam, smeared on white zongzi, even makes gourmets' appetites stir. It adds a layer of charm to the Dragon Boat Festival.</p>
<p>The flowers of early summer, in addition to the above-mentioned varieties, also include climbing roses, honeysuckle, roses, and other flowers, which, like flowing water, bloom in an instant, from tiny calyxes to a riot of color like brocade. But after a few storms, the path is already full of fallen petals, and the ground is covered with remnants of red. Flowers bloom and wither, but it's only for a moment. However, life follows this flowing light, from young to strong, from strong to old. Looking at these flowers that wither easily, one truly feels that "Time, time, will never come again," especially during this time of national crisis, how can we let it pass by idly!</p>

<h3>General Financial Situation: Major Players Concentrated on Covering Short Positions</h3>
<h3>Margin Call Recovers to Six Dollars and Forty Cents</h3>

The trend was upward, and major players such as Daxing, Yongqingfa, and Yonghengxing (represented by Shen Kang) began to cover their positions. The foreign exchange market hardened. Although there were some setbacks in the middle, it eventually rebounded. In the early morning, the overseas silver market and foreign exchange for American cotton all rose.

<p>The post-market opening was at 951.7 jiao, with spot goods opening at 1.5 yuan. There were few transactions and it was very leisurely.

<h3>Overnight Interest Rates Surprisingly Loose, Transfer Fee Greatly Rises</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the banks' collection situation, although not as good as the previous day, was much better than the closing time. The reason is that after the abolition of silver this time, the banks on the Bund absorbed a large amount of cash, eventually leading to the depletion of cash on the market, which made the transfer fee increase surprisingly, and opened at a high price of 4 jiao. However, the overnight interest rate was still only 2 fen. This contradictory behavior is enough to cause doubts among outsiders. The early market trading of transfer notes was more than 6.2 million, more than 600,000 in the early market, more than 400,000 in the small general meeting, the banks' collection amount, foreign merchants collected more than 1.7 million in ticket funds in silver, more than 2.34 million in foreign currency, various goods and foreign exchange special advances and mortgages, and miscellaneous funds were more than 3.5 million in silver, more than 3.67 million in foreign currency, warehousing was 1.2 million, and advances were more than 2.2 million in silver.

<p>The total number of exchanges at the local clearinghouse on the 12th was 5,571,710 yuan and 8 jiao and 6 fen in silver, including 3,639,015 yuan and 8 jiao in silver, and 1,932,695 yuan and 6 fen in silver transferred.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Corner Slightly Rises, Guangdong Corner Plummets</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the early market price for Jiangsu small silver coins was 865 yuan and 5 jiao, and the afternoon market price was 865 yuan and 8 jiao, an improvement of 1 yuan and 5 jiao compared to the previous day. The transaction volume was 7,500 jiao in the early market and 7,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver coins plummeted due to the blockage of the passage to Dalian and the three northeastern provinces and the abundance of sources.

Steel coins were still 311,000 wen, with a transaction volume of more than 37,600 strings of wen.</p>
<h3>The Turbulent Bond Market of Securities</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market for public bonds at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange fluctuated greatly. Although the market sentiment was still weak, the market sentiment could not be unified. People had different opinions and went their own way. The disturbance of the planes in Peiping made the crisis more and more pressing. However, most of the bulls and bears in the market were prepared. Unlike the unexpected attacks of September 18th and January 28th, it was expected that the Japanese invaders had penetrated deeply and affected Peiping and Tianjin, and it was also unexpected that they would be spared. The discovery of enemy aircraft in Peiping the day before yesterday was used by the bears to shake the market, while the bulls also used it to take advantage of the low prices to buy in. In the first session yesterday, the Northern traders of the 11th and 15th recklessly sold off, and the disarmament was reduced by 7 jiao, which was not in line with the environmental facts. The 4th and 50th took advantage of the low prices to absorb, and after entering, the decline gradually eased, and the unified tax auction had rebounded by 1 jiao, and the situation suddenly turned around. The salt tax actually rose by 3 jiao, and compared with the disarmament, the difference between the high and low of the same session was as much as 1 yuan, which turned the market sentiment into firm support. In the second session, there was a consistent rebound, and the disarmament rebounded even more sharply, rising by about 8 jiao, while the salt tax was slightly smaller by 1 or 2 jiao. The sharp drop and sudden rise caused great waves, which was enough to see the different opinions of people. In the afternoon, there was no new news, and the market stabilized. The opening saw each other up and down by 1 or 2 jiao, and the closing was slightly smaller by 1 jiao and a half for 20 volumes. The salt tax did not move, and the rest were slightly better by 1 jiao to 3 jiao. The result of the whole day was a consistent improvement of 1 or 2 jiao to about 3 jiao. The total transaction volume was 10,002,100 yuan, of which the spot goods were only 1,000 yuan for disarmament, and the futures were the most for disarmament, with 1,935,000 yuan done alone, and 3,660,000 yuan done for the unified salt tax. Both the 19th pass and the 20th volume were over 1 million, the 19th Shan and the 20th Guan totaled more than 1.6 million, the coding was also done 600,000, and the rest was only 450,000.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Continues to Rise</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Thursday (the 11th), the New York stock market continued to be active, the market situation rose sharply, and the prices of several stocks actually recovered to a high of 6 yuan, because the commercial news continued to be good, and wages in various industries increased a lot, the Union Pacific Railroad announced that the dividend remained the same, and the difficulties of the Western Union Telephone and Telegraph also passed. There were many bulls who profited and came out, and the market absorbed it very easily, so the buying wind revived, and the closing became more and more frenzied. The total daily transaction volume was 6,160,000 shares. According to the telegram from Haitensdong Company, the New York trustee of the bank, the cotton market has improved its technical position a lot due to the recent conclusion of many bulls. Once the commercial health expands (currently there are signs), the market situation will continue to rise sharply, manufacturers have already seen buying, and the market sentiment is good and extremely common. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left,</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>

<p>Twenty Railway Stocks 37.43 Rise 1.40</p>
<p>Twenty Public Stocks 28.48 Rise 1.46</p>
<p>Forty Bonds 80.69 Rise 1.09</p>
<h3>Yarn and Flower Spread Empty, Offset Margin Yarn</h3>
<p>Foreign cotton is still rising, and margin yarn is slightly offset by the sellers because the market saw new low prices yesterday. Shenxin Factory opened 5,000 bales of term yarn, resulting in hedging. In general, the yarn market has no fixed price and must be shifted according to actual sales.</p>
<h3>The Human Standard Process is Vague</h3>
<p>The human standard is affected by the rising raw material prices, which has led to a part of the empty-headed retail investors to offset. In the end, the trend is quite vague due to the weak digestion of the current yarn. As a result, the prices of each month rose by 1 yuan to 1 yuan and 5 jiao.

<h3>Recent News on Silk, Tea, and Sericulture in Jiangsu and Zhejiang</h3>
<p>(Changzhou) In various towns and villages, the number of farmers unable to raise silkworms this year is increasing. Mulberry trees are budding later due to the cold weather, causing a delay in the silkworm season. Silkworm farmers, lacking the funds to purchase silkworm eggs, are borrowing from township offices to buy and raise improved breeds. After hatching, the weather has been sunny and warm, and the silkworms are developing well. However, due to economic factors, there is a wide disparity in the progress of the silkworm season. The earliest silkworms in the southwest villages are already in the "large eye" stage, while in the eastern villages, the majority of silkworms are beginning to feed after their third molt, and in the northern villages, the latest silkworms have just begun their third molt.</p>
<p>(Yuhang) In areas such as Pingyao and Changle Bridge, farmers who incubated local breeds early in the season have almost completely discarded them. Although the improved breeds raised as replacements are starting later, the sunny and warm weather has been conducive to their development. Furthermore, instructors are assisting in the process, ensuring that the silkworms are progressing very well. However, the silkworm season is uneven, with some early silkworms already emerging from their cocoons and ready to spin their silk, while others are just beginning to feed after their fourth molt, and the latest hatchlings are still beginning to feed after their third molt.</p>
<h3>### Silk Cocoon Merchants Request Tax Exemption and Relief</h3>
<p>Telegraphic Request for Exemption of Various Taxes to Lighten the Burden</p>
<p>Recently, silk cocoon merchants in this city have reported a slump in the sales of raw silk by foreign firms, causing silk prices to plummet. The price of Grade B white filature silk has fallen to 500 taels. At this price, the cost of raw materials for each 100 catties of fresh cocoons is only worth just over 20 yuan. As the new cocoons from Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are about to enter the market, if the government does not provide tax exemption and relief, the economies of both farmers and merchants are bound to go bankrupt. Therefore, the Silk Cocoon General Association and the Silk Factory Association have telegraphed the governments and finance departments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, requesting exemption from cocoon trade business tax, stamp tax, inspection fees, education fees, and local public welfare donations in order to lighten the burden and maintain the livelihoods of farmers and merchants.</p>
<h3>### High-Grade Green Tea Sales to France Continue Smoothly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the tea market in this city saw continued activity in the sales of green tea from Sui'an, local estates, Wenzhou, and other routes to French merchants. A total of 629 boxes were purchased by firms such as Jardine Matheson, Concordia, Jinlong, and Tianyu. "Zhen Mei" tea sold for 100 to 150 yuan, while "Zhen Mei" needle tea sold for 43 to 62 yuan, with no change from the previous day. However, as various foreign firms are already packing and exporting new goods, it is expected that future purchases will be more conservative in pricing.</p>
<h3>### Food: Rice Prices in He Xia Fall by 10-20 Cents</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, 50-60 sources arrived. However, due to wavering confidence, the market for both retail and wholesale rice remained sluggish. Although the situation improved slightly, the market was still stagnant due to the abundant supply. Consequently, the prices of "Su Tong" glutinous rice and "Nan Gang" rice continued to fall by 10-20 cents. Merchants mostly purchased over a thousand bags of thin rice from Nanyang and Xinghua, as well as "Qing Jiao", "Songjiang", "Fengxi", and "Lian", but remained demanding, refusing to accept unless the price was lowered. As a result, the market price for thin rice fell by ten cents, while medium-quality rice fell by approximately twenty cents. This sluggish market was unexpected, and there is no expectation of a turnaround. "Du Yang Jian" rice continued to soften by several points, while "Yin Yuan" also fell by ten cents. "Bian Yuan" rice was able to hold steady due to a lack of supply.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, about 30 sources arrived from the He Xia region. The market for white glutinous rice was weak, and prices fell by 10-20 cents. Thin rice of high quality fell by nearly 10 cents. The supply of early rice was strong, but demand was sluggish, and prices also fell by 10-20 cents. The supply of "Yang Jian" rice continued, and sales were good at the opening price. Medium and lower qualities were down by 10 cents. "Du Jian" rice was down by 10 cents, while "Ke Jian" rice was weak. "Yin Bian Yuan" rice showed signs of weakness.</p>
<p>▲ Correction: Yesterday's report stated that the market bushel was enlarged by 6.81 deciliters. Today, a letter from the Bean and Rice Trade Association states that the Association uses the standard bushel calibrated by the Inspection Bureau and that the Bureau sends personnel to supervise, making it impossible to enlarge or shrink the bushel in any way. This correction is made with utmost urgency.</p>
<h3>### Northern Merchants Buy Min Party Rice</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice saw renewed activity. Merchants from this street bought 200 bags of "Gao Xiao Jiao" at 7.575 yuan. Merchants from other regions also expressed interest but were still negotiating the price. Northern merchants also saw activity and agreed with Anli Foreign Firm to buy 1,000 bags of Min Party rice at 7.75 yuan. There has been no trade in Min Party rice for a long time, and the asking price was previously 8 yuan. This batch of goods is relatively old, so the selling price could not be raised to the full amount. Furthermore, Fuhua Foreign Firm was in the market selling new transactions, planning to load 70,000 bags of "Gao Xiao Jiao", asking for 4.97 yuan per 100 catties, while buyers were offering 4.93 yuan. With a difference of only 4 cents, a compromise may be reached.</p>
<p>Merchants hoarding "Ke Xian" rice were seeking to sell, while merchants were loading up for delivery. Although the demand from Fuzhou was active, the eagerness of the hoarders to sell off their stocks caused prices to fall by a few cents. It is estimated that 200 bags of Jiangxi "Ji Wan" rice were sold at 8.10-8.15 yuan, 190 bags of Wuhu "Ji Yuan" rice at 9.9 yuan to 4.92 yuan, 170 bags of Hunan "Ji Yuan" rice at 9.5 yuan, 200 bags of "Ji You" rice at 8.7 yuan, 177 bags of "Qi You" rice at 7.5 yuan, 320 bags of "Ji Hong" rice at 8.12 yuan, 380 bags of "Bi Jing" rice at 7.18-7.1 yuan, and 700 bags of "Qi Jing" rice at 6.71-6.5 yuan, all purchased by Fuzhou merchants.</p>
<h3>### Actual Sales Are Weak</h3>
<p>Flour Market Rises and Then Weakens</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the market opened, various months showed a firm trend. The price of foreign wheat in Chicago rebounded by 9.0 cents, and in Canada by 7.0 cents, so at the opening, various months rose by about 1 cent compared to the previous month. However, after the second session, the market sentiment for various months gradually weakened. Due to the current national economic downturn, both industry insiders and outsiders felt that there was no interest in buying. Therefore, although the foreign situation is improving, the actual sales in this city are still not picking up. This situation is unlikely to recover in the short term. When the market opened in the afternoon, the market for various months showed further weakness, and transactions were sluggish and lifeless. Due to the lack of enthusiasm from buyers, various months naturally tended to weaken again, so although the morning was good, the afternoon was weaker. As a result, the current month was down by 0.5 cents compared to the previous day, July was down by 0.25 cents, September was up by 0.25 cents, and there were no comparisons for the rest.</p>
<h3>### Wheat Bran Only Opened at 2.05 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since the reduction of the market tax for wheat bran sales from inland provinces, the opening price has been loosening repeatedly, with little hope of recovery. Yesterday's opening price was only 2.05 yuan, equivalent to about 1.45 taels of silver from the past. Compared to the highest price in previous years, it has fallen by nearly half, showing how significantly the decline in various commodity prices is related to the current situation.</p>
<h3>### New Broad Beans Arrive Soon</h3>
<p>First Batch of 300-400 Bags</p>
<p>The cold weather this year will inevitably delay the emergence of new crops. Fortunately, the weather has been clear recently, and new broad beans will soon be on the market. The first batch of goods from Wenzhou, about 300-400 bags, is expected to arrive in 3-4 days. It is reported that the harvest in that area is promising. However, due to the rush for new products, the quality is slightly soft. The selling price for the first batch arriving in Shanghai is expected to be around 5 yuan, but it is unknown what the market trend will be.</p>
<h3>### Sugar Market: Coarse and Fine White Sugar Prices Stabilize</h3>
<p>Yesterday, sugar prices stabilized as sales did not improve after the price increase. The Association's designated prices were 20.2 yuan for 24 coarse white sugar in original packaging, 19.6 yuan for 20 medium white sugar, and 16.1 yuan for 89 Dutch brown sugar, but there were few transactions, indicating a renewed trend toward weakness. Changxing Firm sold sugar from the Guanghua Sugar Factory at 20.045 yuan for the "Lu" brand and 19.95 yuan for the "Shou" brand. Coarse ground sugar in Guangzhou packaging was priced at 20.06 yuan. The Guangchao merchants offered over 100 baskets of sliced green sugar at 8.2 yuan, and 100 bags of Guang ice sugar at 22 yuan, down by 80 cents. It is said that subsequent batches have arrived, so the market is weak. Hainan offered over 100 bags at 13.25 yuan, slightly lower than before. Chaoqing was offered at 11.8-11.6 yuan, and the lower grade at 11.2 yuan. The newly arrived high-quality Zheng Mian red sugar was priced at 15.1-15 yuan, and the lower grade at 14.8-14.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>### North and South Goods: Glutinous Rice Twigs Price Remains High</h3>
<p>Lychee sales have become sluggish again, and the prices of "Jinshan Yuanzhi," "Bianzhi," "Haikouzhi," "Shuidongzhi," and "Jianzhuzhu" have all fallen. However, because there is not much "Nuomizhi" in stock and the shops have run out of it, the market price has not been willing to go too low. The higher-priced ones sold for 145 yuan yesterday, and the next-highest for 135 yuan.</p>
<h3>### Metals: Blue Lead Rebounds by 15 Cents</h3>
<p>The blue lead market, affected by few actual transactions and the rise in the US dollar exchange rate, has seen prices fall. The lowest price was 15.35 yuan per dan, while forward sales were at 15 yuan. Yesterday, New York telegraphed that its price was 47 gold dollars per ton, a sharp increase of 2.5 gold dollars compared to the previous price. However, due to the inability to make actual transactions in Shanghai, the price only rose by 15 cents, and the current price is 15.5 yuan per dan. Aside from small retail sales, there were no large transactions. It is said that the current cost of arriving goods is still around 36.75 yuan and 37 yuan (US dollars) per ton, so there is little hope for a significant increase in the market price.</p>
<h3>### Oil Market: Hongtong Oil Lacks Momentum</h3>
<p>Hongjiang tung oil is currently in its sales season. However, in recent years, due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy, domestic sales have declined year after year, and the annual production cannot be sold out. The fundamental problem for the past 3-4 years has been the oversupply. Hongtong oil is made from white tung oil and is exclusively used for painting and varnishing in China. It has no other uses and no foreign markets, limiting its sales and application. Based on current sales, unless production decreases, there will be an annual surplus, and there is fundamentally no solution. Even with the current sales season in summer, the market is as quiet as if it were off-season. Even if prices are loosened, they cannot attract buyers. This is due to the economic limitations of farmers, who cannot afford to engage in decoration. Secondary brands such as Yang Hengyuan and Qingyuanfeng are only selling for slightly over 21 yuan per barrel, and the market situation still has no potential for development.</p>

<h3>### The World Gone Mad</h3>
<p>— Jingzi</p>
<p>Reading the petition submitted by lawyer ×× on behalf of prisoners to the Ministry of Justice to investigate the long-standing malpractices of ××× Prison in yesterday's newspaper filled me with nameless sorrow. It also reminded me of a friend who starved to death in prison two years ago—a young man swallowed up by darkness. It was also in ××× Prison, that dark world, that terrifying den of demons. As far as I know, my friend was a diligent student, a promising young man, who was arrested by the police and handed over to a certain military organization simply for initiating and organizing an academic research society, and was sentenced to more than three years in prison. He was already seriously ill when he was sent to ××× Prison; however, the "benevolent" doctor in the prison determined that his illness was feigned. His fellow prisoners requested the prison authorities to temporarily remove the shackles from his hands and feet, but it was never allowed. He struggled in agony under the scourge of disease and shackles, and spent the whole day breathing out low and miserable groans. Sometimes even his groans were suppressed by angry scolding and whipping, and he could only quietly wait for death, unable to make a sound. When he was obviously beyond saving, he was moved to another dark room to await "divine grace." Only then was he allowed to temporarily remove the shackles from his rotting hands and feet. But with the removal of the shackles, this young man, this prisoner, finally opened his eyes, let out a miserable laugh, and was utterly released—he sacrificed himself in the dark den of demons.</p>
<p>The tragic death of this friend is not worth mentioning, as there are countless young victims sacrificed under the shroud of darkness and terror. And this phenomenon is not unique to China; Japan, Germany, Italy, and the entire world are all like this. The recent beating to death of a certain Japanese writer by the police is an example right before our eyes.</p>
<p>The whole world has gone mad, and history has returned to the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>War, massacre, terror, imprisonment, destruction, the dance of demons, the groans of slaves, the whole world has gone mad—</p>
<p>"Killing" has replaced "freedom," and "arrest" and "imprisonment" have confined "will." This is the golden age of interventionism.</p>
<p>Electrocution, tiger benches, pepper water forced up the nose, forced confessions, beatings, and humiliations occur both inside and outside prisons. Some are seeking death but cannot find it, while others are grinning ferociously. This is what the world is like—civilization has gone bankrupt, barbarism has been resurrected, and a vast expanse of fog has enveloped the entire world.</p>
<p>This world, this century, the suffering of civilization, the catastrophe of mankind, the reversal of history—</p>
<p>What is ××× Prison? This world is also a dark and miserable large prison cage. Complain? Where can we go to complain?</p>
<h3>### Doctor (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shizhen</p>
<p>He lay in that gloomy sickroom, enduring the early mornings and the late evenings, enduring the indifferent faces of those young disciples, hoping to escape from the clutches of the disease, but God had no pity on him, and the disease grew worse day by day. Finally, not only did the lung disease not diminish, but it also added new symptoms. His testicles were swollen. This alarmed the medical scholar, who came to see him in person. He said that this phenomenon was because the lung bacteria had been driven by the medicine to the testicles, so it was necessary to cut off one testicle, and once it was cut off, his lung disease could gradually improve. Thank God, if his words were true. At that time, I told this to another friend, who liked to tell jokes, and he said, "This doctor is probably not very skilled. According to him, the lung bacteria can be driven away, so why don't they drive the lung bacteria all the way to the soles of the feet and drop them on the ground, instead of driving them to that important place?"</p>
<p>At the same time, the medical scholar also introduced another famous surgical doctor. My old friend was carried from one hospital to another, and in less than thirty minutes, the surgery was performed. After resting for a week, he moved back to his old hospital. But his illness still did not improve, and soon, the only remaining testicle was still swollen. So the medical scholar had to come again in person. After his diagnosis, he said that the previous testicle had not been cut cleanly, and the remaining piece had congealed with the other good testicle, so the remaining one also had to be cut off. But the patient's body could not withstand it. The doctor naturally knew this better than we did. Cutting it off would probably lead to death sooner, while not cutting it off could prolong life for a few more days and allow for a peaceful death. So my friend and I both argued that we should not cut it off again.</p>
<p>Sure enough, after a few days, in the middle of one night, my friend breathed his last breath!—Let us bless this soul who struggled with illness for so long, may he rest in peace!</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>My life has not been very long, and I have not seen many more abominable doctors' faces, but I have heard more cruel things. Do readers have the patience to hear me tell one or two more stories?</p>
<p>In Tokyo, a Japanese woman went to the Imperial University Hospital to see an eye doctor. Many assistants could not diagnose her disease. They invited the head of ophthalmology, who was also a very reputable old doctor. He opened the woman's eyelids up and down to look at them, and he understood, proud and satisfied. He was surrounded by a large group of intern students, who stood solemnly listening to their teacher's insights. The old doctor turned the woman's eyes and explained the cause of the disease to the students, pointing out the symptoms of the disease currently in the eyes, but he forgot the pain that the suffering woman was enduring under these circumstances.</p>
<p>The old doctor finished speaking triumphantly, giving the woman unparalleled glory, and personally dripped eye drops. But the woman's eyes had been tortured for so long and no longer obeyed her own control. Just as the eye drops were about to be dripped in, her eyes flashed with soreness and pain. The old doctor made several attempts but did not succeed. He lost his temper and slapped the woman's cheeks twice, threw the things down, and walked away in anger. The poor woman's eyes were dizzy, as if she had fainted. The students standing around looked in shock at the old doctor walking away and the woman with her eyes spinning, but no one dared to continue the surgery.</p>
<p>When the woman's consciousness became clear again, the young students told her to beg their teacher; in the end, the woman's smiling face and kneeling entreaties softened the old doctor's heart, and he came back to put in the drops again. "This is not unusual," the Japanese student who told me this story said, "because scientists are the noblest people in society!"</p>
<p>I have seen the authority of Japanese authoritative doctors, so I believe these words.</p>
<p>Slapping a woman heavily on the cheeks, although it is a great humiliation, is ultimately very different from taking a woman's life. Let me tell another story of an unfortunate woman who died at the hands of a cruel doctor.</p>
<p>The matter happened in Beiping, and many people knew about it at the time. I also do not want to announce the name of the hospital.</p>
<p>In a certain hospital in Beiping, a woman had a disease in her abdomen and had to undergo abdominal surgery. A famous doctor took on this job. This doctor's business had always been booming. One time, while he was performing surgery on this unfortunate woman, a call suddenly came from a certain important person summoning the doctor. The doctor thought only of the benefits he could get from seeing an important person once, so he forgot about the woman under his hands and casually told the assistants to sew up her belly. He got into a car and flew to the important person's house.</p>
<p>When the doctor returned, the woman had already died. The woman's family did not agree and demanded that the doctor reopen the abdomen to look. The abdomen was opened again, and in the intestines and stomach, a pair of scissors was found, which had been left inside because they had not been careful at the time!</p>
<p>This doctor had definite evidence of committing murder, but the laws of mankind did not punish him. I do not know why.</p>
<p>Therefore, I curse this doctor and all doctors who resemble him!</p>
<h3>### Random Words from the Qu Cottage</h3>
<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(26) What Year Is This?</p>
<p>What year is this? This is a foolish question that the intelligent people of our nation should be able to answer easily. If you ask a politician, the politician will surely say it is the year of constitutional government, where Zhuge Liang makes the laws and A Dou carries them out. If you ask a military strategist, the military strategist will surely say it is the year of suppressing bandits, where resistance against Japan need not be short-term, but can last for thousands upon thousands of years. Furthermore, if you ask an industrialist or merchant, they will say it is the year of domestic goods, as seen in the touching advertisements. If you ask an economist or agriculturist, they will say it is the year of rural revitalization, with special agencies already established. If you ask a thinker, they will say it is the year of widespread criticism, where Hu Shi has already become the target of arrows. If you ask an author, they will say it is the year of the author's autobiography, where self-narrated sorrows continue in clusters. If you ask a humorist, they will say it is the year of humor, where humorous articles spread like wildfire. As for me, I do not belong to any one school, but since I have taken up the pen to write, I will attach myself to the coattails of humor. What else can I say? What else is there to be humble about? However, humor comes from English, so it has the suspicion of being a foreign import. Since the national consciousness is astute, writing should avoid foreign allusions. We should remember our ancestors when citing precedents and love our country completely. Therefore, when I discuss humorous writers, I start with Confucius and Zhuang Zhou. Confucius and Zhuang Zhou lived during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods when the feudal lords were immoral and there were many taboos. One had to be humorous in order to open their mouths and write their pens. When the people of Zheng cursed Confucius as a homeless dog, Confucius accepted it happily. When people called Zhuang Zhou a cow or a horse, Zhuang Zhou would answer as a cow or a horse. The saints and sages like Confucius and Zhuang Zhou were not willing to be treated as dogs and horses, but they felt that in those chaotic times, people were worse than dogs and horses, so if they were called dogs and horses, they would simply be dogs and horses. Why should they argue? This is the humor of Confucius and Zhuang Zhou. However, Confucius aimed to pursue wealth and position, and he worked tirelessly to achieve this. Those who call themselves disciples of the sage often distort learning and pander to the world, aiding the wicked and abusing the tyrant, using their talent to steal a reputation and their intelligence to adorn evil. In every era, there have been people like Li Si and Feng Dao. Today's ambitious young people often</p>
<p>Curse the celebrities and scholars, saying, "This is so-and-so's running dog! This is so-and-so's party's running dog! This is so-and-so's class's running dog!" I don't know if these gentlemen have the magnanimity of Confucius and would say "Yes, yes," and happily accept it. This is why the humor of Confucius is unattainable and admirable. Now, there are writers who worship Confucius as the patron saint of humor, and there is good reason for this. Zhuang Zhou, on the other hand, willingly endured the humiliation of dragging his tail in the mud rather than taking office in the state, regarded the sage as a great thief, treated wealth and nobility as dirt, did not condemn right and wrong, and did not respect benevolence and righteousness. He saw the court of an immoral monarch and saw Jie in his heart; when he left the immoral wilderness, he met people who looked like Yi but had Zhi in their hearts. Why would he take the empty names of benevolence and righteousness and the undefined right and wrong? When he wrote, he felt that the world was mired in turbidity and could not be engaged with serious words. In today's language, it means that you cannot tell the truth in chaotic times. Therefore, he used "slanderous words" to expand, "heavy words" to convey truth, and "parables" to spread ideas. What are "slanderous words"? Long and verbose, boasting and exaggerating, flowery language, inexplicable mystery, like the speeches and declarations made by important figures. What are "heavy words"? In the past, writers quoted classics, "The Book of Songs says," "Confucius said." Today's commentators, if they do not quote Sun Yat-sen, Marx, then they quote Plekhanov, Lunacharsky, and so on. What are "parables"? Pointing at the mulberry tree and cursing the locust tree; hating the monk and beating the bald donkey: this is what today's poets and novelists excel at. Zhuang Zhou used these three elements to write, and Zhuang Zhou himself said that he used absurd theories, outrageous words, and unfounded expressions, sometimes indulging and not being bound, and not seeing himself as _. Humorous literature, this is the height of achievement. If the world were easily made orderly, Zhuang Zhou would probably not come out of this. Xun Qing said that in chaotic times, writing is hidden but colorful. These words are probably close to the truth. Alas, there are writers today who were born in this prosperous age but unfortunately are also known for their humor!</p>
<h3>Red Carrot Whiskers</h3>
<p>— Written by Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>The Teakettle</p>
<p>Red Carrot Whiskers rarely had the chance to be useful to his family. He lurked in a corner, waiting for such an opportunity to arise. He listened without prejudice, and when the time came, he would emerge from the shadows, like a thoughtful person who alone remained calm among many troubled by passion, taking on the responsibility of directing everything.</p>
<p>He guessed that the Raypeak family needed clever and reliable help. Of course, she wouldn't tell him herself. She had too much self-respect. The agreement was formed in tacit understanding: Red Carrot Whiskers should act without encouragement and without expecting any reward, doing it all voluntarily.</p>
<p>He decided to get started.</p>
<p>From morning till night, a teakettle hung on the iron hook of the fireplace. In winter, when a lot of hot water was needed, the kettle was often filled and emptied, boiling over a large fire.</p>
<p>In summer, the water in the kettle was only needed after each meal to wash the dishes. The rest of the time, it boiled uselessly, constantly making soft chirping sounds, while two pieces of firewood smoldered beneath its cracked belly, almost extinguished.</p>
<p>Sometimes, Orolin no longer heard the chirping of the teakettle, so she would bend down and listen with her ear close.</p>
<p>"The water has all boiled away," she would say.</p>
<p>She would then take a bucket of water and pour it into the kettle, putting the two pieces of firewood together and stirring the ashes. After a while, the gentle song would rise again, and Orolin, relieved, would run off to do other things.</p>
<p>If someone said to her:</p>
<p>"Orolin, why are you boiling water you don't need? Take the kettle off and put out the fire. You're burning the firewood as if it didn't cost anything. When the weather gets cold, many poor people will be freezing to death without firewood, yet you are wasting resources. But you have always been a thrifty woman."</p>
<p>She would shake her head.</p>
<p>She had always seen a teakettle hanging on the fireplace hook.</p>
<p>She had always heard the sound of boiling water, whether it was raining, windy, or sunny. When the kettle was empty, she would fill it.</p>
<p>She now didn't even need to touch the kettle or look at it; she had memorized it in her heart. She only needed to listen. If the kettle made no sound, she would pour a bucket of water into it. She had become so accustomed to it, like stringing pearls, that she had never made a mistake.</p>
<p>Today, for the first time, she made a mistake.</p>
<p>The water poured onto the fire, and a cloud of ash, like a wild beast disturbed and enraged, pounced on Orolin, enveloping her, burning her, and suffocating her.</p>
<p>She let out a cry, recoiling while sneezing and coughing.</p>
<p>"Oh dear, I thought a ghost had crawled out from under the floor," she said.</p>
<p>Her eyes closed tightly in pain, she groped in the darkness of the fireplace with her blackened hands.</p>
<p>"Ah! I know now," she said with surprise. "The kettle is gone."</p>
<p>"No, I really don't understand why. The kettle was just here. There's no mistake, because I heard it chirping like a flute," she said.</p>
<p>The kettle had been taken away while Orolin had turned her back to empty vegetable peels out the window.</p>
<p>But who took it?</p>
<p>The Raypeak family, looking solemn and calm, appeared on the straw mat at the bedroom doorway.</p>
<p>"Making such a commotion, Orolin!"</p>
<p>"You call this a commotion, you call this a commotion!" Orolin cried. "How could I not make a commotion after such a ghostly thing happened! I almost got burned.</p>
<p>Look at my wooden shoes, my skirt, my hands. My pockets are full of coal dust." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Three Weeks Six O'Clock</h3>
<p>— Niu</p>
<p>Our country originally had the riddle of "The Hour of Yu on the Twenty-first Day." The "Hour of Yu on the Twenty-first Day" refers to the character "醋" (vinegar). The men and women of our country, unlike those in Russia, are not open in their relationships and are inherently very jealous. Men treat women as a forbidden indulgence, and women treat men as a forbidden indulgence. Therefore, if one side engages in extramarital activities, the other side becomes acidic. Now, with a new twist, the expression has changed to "Three Weeks, Six O'Clock," which still means the same as "The Hour of Yu on the Twenty-first Day." I don't understand why people always measure time in three-week increments.</p>
<p>When welcoming important foreign dignitaries with naval gun salutes, twenty-one guns are always fired. During Yuan Shikai's era, the Japanese presented conditions, forcing our country to acknowledge them, also consisting of twenty-one articles. Now, the major sales at major companies and stores in Shanghai also last for twenty-one days in most cases. Even our country's old proverbs say, "Regardless of three times seven is twenty-one." Why not say four times seven is twenty-eight, or four times eight is thirty-two? Why not fire a neat twenty guns in a gun salute? Why not propose twenty, thirty, or forty conditions, instead of an odd twenty-one? The same goes for store sales. Why must they last for twenty-one days? I originally had no idea about the reasoning behind this.</p>
<p>It just so happens that I've discovered another twenty-one-day instance: Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of the Indian National Congress, began a twenty-one-day fast on May 8th as a protest against the disenfranchisement of the untouchable caste. I truly don't understand. Fasting means not eating rice, not eating bread, and avoiding most other foods. However, according to doctors, a strong person who fasts will die in seven days, while a weak person will die in four or five days. How can Gandhi's fast be scheduled for twenty-one days and still not necessarily lead to death? According to Gandhi, "If the British government does not meet his demands after twenty-one days of fasting, he is willing to go to prison." This kind of fasting is very strange. Perhaps the method of fasting is not abrupt but rather, like friends quitting smoking, reduced day by day.</p>
<p>Gandhi's fast reminded me of our comrade, Young Marshal Zhang, who also fasted in Shanghai for twenty-one days and also did not die. This is truly strange. Isn't our comrade Young Marshal Zhang known as the Gandhi of our country? Because Gandhi advocates the "non-resistance" doctrine, and Young Marshal Zhang advocates the "non-resistance" doctrine. Regardless of whether one is a citizen of a fallen country and the other is a young marshal with soldiers and guns who has not yet lost his country, whether they should hold the same doctrine is debatable. But since their doctrines are similar, it is appropriate to consider him the Gandhi of our country.</p>
<p>Not only does Young Marshal Zhang share Gandhi's doctrine, but even in the matter of fasting, he is identical to Gandhi. It is said that Young Marshal Zhang's trip abroad to Italy is partly for rest and partly to promote our country's prestige abroad. According to the Young Marshal himself, he intends to return to serve the country after resting abroad. It is commendable to not forget national salvation even while enjoying leisure. However, because Italy does not have a public monopoly on opium, nor is there private domestic opium available, he decided to fast for twenty-one days in Shanghai due to these inconveniences. During this fasting period, it was said to be very dangerous, but fortunately, it was successfully overcome thanks to the proper medical treatment of a certain doctor. However, according to inquiries, the Young Marshal used as many as twenty-one nurses (or nineteen according to one account) during this fast, and the cost of the fast reached as high as 210,000 yuan (or 200,000 according to one account). This kind of fasting is truly more meaningful than that of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>

<h3>The Heat of Youth</h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>"Look, this cheongsam is too short, not even covering the heels of my shoes. The color isn't pretty either. It should be bright red, isn't everyone wearing bright red?" She said, casually taking off the cheongsam and throwing it on the bed, then trying on a new one.</p>
<p>She pretended to be very unhappy and glared at the young man who was waiting for her to leave. "This cheongsam is too loose at the waist. It would be so embarrassing to wear it out. I'm not going." She deliberately took off the cheongsam again, and in front of the mirror, wiggled her butt and turned around, striking a dancing pose.</p>
<p>"If it doesn't fit right, it doesn't matter. If you don't like it, we'll make a new one tomorrow. It's getting late. Let's go see 'The Heat of Youth'!" the young man pleaded, his eyes fixed on the flesh beneath her undershirt, fantasizing about the steps he would take in the dark cinema.</p>
<p>"No, no, no..." she said with a sidelong glance and feigned anger, tapping the floor with her high-heeled shoes.</p>
<p>"I promise you, we'll make another bright red one, my dear sister!" He hugged her body like a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey and kissed her wildly.</p>
<p>Struggle, resistance.</p>
<p>"Who cares about your 'coming'?" She said coyly, looking at her apple-red face in the mirror.</p>
<p>"I didn't say you wanted it, we are friends, offering another red dress based on friendship... haha... to strengthen our bond," he said, smiling with satisfaction. His wide mouth stretched out towards her apple cheeks, but she deliberately dodged it. He moved even more boldly closer.</p>
<p>"Annoying..." a muffled voice.</p>
<p>"Let's go, it's getting late." A triumphant return.</p>
<p>He opened the stiff collar of the new cheongsam. Like a marble boy, she still twisted her waist, halfheartedly, before finally slipping her white lotus arms into the sleeves.</p>
<p>The figures in the mirror resumed their work. A youthful couple, hand in hand, stepped out of the door, greeted by a warm early summer breeze.</p>
<p>"Why is it so hot?" Artificial eyebrows furrowed as she spoke.</p>
<p>"Shall we go to the Jardin de la Salle after?"</p>
<p>A nod of agreement.</p>
<p>He was the son of a bank president, with plenty of money at home. His parents had specially built him a body like a bull. This bull was the standard young man of 1933. He had been in a certain university for three years, and his time spent in the classroom was probably measured in hours, but at every sports meet, his records were particularly numerous. His photos appeared in every sports publication and newspaper. The school, in order to ensure he won every sports championship, had almost allowed him to graduate. She was the queen of his school, and many effeminate boys who traded in jade-like items had been manipulated by her and become weary of it. Therefore, with the social skills of a queen, she had seized the bull for herself. Besides a certain satisfaction, there was also a bank behind him. This was the reason the queen was hanging on the young man's arm.</p>
<p>He hadn't expected that the bull's luck would turn in 1933. The innate shortcomings he had previously thought of could now win a woman's heart, and he effortlessly embraced the queen with his wealth.</p>
<p>They walked slowly along the sidewalk, entering the cinema twenty minutes later. The young and mature female lead smiled at the foreign bull, revealing her white legs.</p>
<p>In the darkness, they both felt a satisfying comfort.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>He thought: "The bull is a great object of female attention!"</p>
<p>She: "To manipulate a man, you only need to flash a white leg!"</p>
<h3>The Most Effective National Salvation Policy</h3>
<p>— Jie Lu</p>
<p>丨Castration for National Salvation Theory丨</p>
<p>Who doesn't shout "China is weak!" "China is poor!" Why is it so weak and poor? There must be a reason. Therefore, the patriotic people who have invented "dancing for national salvation," "aviation for national salvation," "broadsword for national salvation," "movies for national salvation," etc., etc., have each offered their grand ideas, opening up a scheme to save China from poverty and weakness. Whether they are correct or not, we will have to wait and see the effects in the future. Whether they are effective or not, there is no guarantee of a refund.</p>
<p>According to my humble opinion, the most effective national salvation policies are only two words: one is "heart" and the other is "sex." No matter how good the theory is, if there is hypocrisy, it will be ineffective. Doctrines, speeches, and plans all belong to the "human problem." Without "integrity" and "conscience," good things cannot be done. Therefore, after a boycott, there must be a group of people without "integrity" and "conscience" who will profit from it. Therefore, I say that doctrines and plans cannot save the country and may even accelerate its demise. Second, I say "sex" for national salvation. Does this mean that if our country has a few more sexology professors like Mr. Zhang Jingsheng, the country will be saved? In this era of love and carnality, even the literary masters who bear the great mission of cultural movement are trying their best to promote sexology, so why should I speak further? However, what I am saying about "sex for national salvation" is not fabricated and is indeed based on fact. According to a Berlin telegraph on May 5th:</p>
<p>"The National Socialist government is currently considering a new law that all criminals and those with physical or mental disabilities will be rendered unable to reproduce, and interracial marriage will be prohibited in order to improve the Aryan race." Originally, pigs and boars have the most astonishing birth rate, only knowing "eating" and "reproducing" without doing anything else, and it is not a pity if they are slaughtered. The same is true for the people of our country. "Eating" aside, the ability to "reproduce" is also admirable. Is it because poor friends do not have the fortune to study the sexology of concubines and are just finding poor fun with their yellow-faced wives? They do not know that the poorer they are, the more they reproduce, and the more they reproduce, the poorer they become. Rural bankruptcy, economic panic, and the global depression all stem from this. It is not unique to China!</p>
<p>According to biologists, "The human reproduction rate is a geometric progression, doubling every twenty-five years." Reading history, after decades or centuries, there will inevitably be great chaos, which is iron proof of overpopulation. Moreover, although we Chinese may have weak physiques, we are very vigorous in reproduction, not caring about the spread of flawed offspring. Hitler was able to promulgate new laws in Germany, using methods to prevent criminals and people with physical disabilities from reproducing, which is truly the only way to enrich the country and strengthen the race. Therefore, I have come up with a good strategy for national salvation, which is the "eunuch national salvation argument." I wonder if the officials will adopt my humble suggestion?</p>
<h3>A Trip to the Park</h3>
<p>— Bei</p>
<p>"This is paradise, glorious paradise!"</p>
<p>Escaping from the piles of life, dragging my heavy body, I approached the entrance of ×× Park. I couldn't help but praise it in this way. Seeing my anxious and almost frantic appearance, the gatekeeper blocked the threshold, repeatedly shouting "Pass! Pass! " a third "Pass!".</p>
<p>"This is paradise, glorious paradise!"</p>
<p>Finding my way inside, my muscles relaxed, and my soul seemed to float in space. I praised it again in this way.</p>
<p>Here, the emotion that floated to my mind was the "croak, croak, croak" of frogs clamoring in the park's pond. So I stopped in my tracks and began a new contemplation: My hometown, five thousand miles away, isn't it precisely at this time when the frogs croak loudly across the fields? Why has it become a bad omen, like the hooting of an owl at midnight or the cawing of a crow in the morning, foreboding ill? Regardless of gender or age, everyone has left their homes and fields, drifting far away to a foreign land, leaving only my father to guard it in his labored breathing. Are the frogs still croaking at this time? And what kind of tone are they croaking in?</p>
<p>Expanding it further: The cries of the thirty million compatriots in the Northeast, the sound of the righteous army's bloody battles against the enemy, must also be croaking like frogs, but who is listening? Who has ever heard them?</p>
<p>"Look, isn't that someone tailing someone else in front? A man following a woman!" Brother Xi reminded me, oh, the park is such a kind of stage. With trailing, with love, it's probably inevitable that there will be a third kind, like the human flesh trade in the Xinxin Bridge area. I even remembered that the wife of the ×× philosopher was tailed from here, and the lovers of ×× classmate also became a family tailed from here.</p>
<p>"Ah, this is even more a paradise of romance!" I changed my first praise.</p>
<p>Not even walking a full circle, in the thick shade of trees on Lafayette Road, came a "giggle, giggle" sound, a pair of angels embracing, kissing wildly, exchanging soul and flesh.</p>
<p>Sitting on the edge of the pond, facing the "splash, splash" of ducks hitting the water, that sound mixed with sweet whispers and songs, undulating on the water of the pond. It was a time for the park visitors to be intoxicated.</p>
<p>Where there is good in the world, there must be evil. Where there are lovely beautiful scenes, there are bound to be unexpected disappointments that spoil the scenery. One small stone after another was thrown in from outside the fence, obviously from those who were rejected outside feeling unfair, and the number of visitors gradually dwindled.</p>
<p>Although the weather was very good, there was no sign of the crescent moon. The moon, the bright moon, was only peeking through the dense clouds. Near Hualong Road, a new bathhouse was under construction. Under the white-hot electric lights, the workers were "bang, bang, bang" releasing the clanging sound of hammers and stones. When we slipped out from the relatively relaxed gaze of the gatekeeper, a storm was already urgently approaching.</p>

<h3>Picking Up Gold</h3>
<p>— Yan Ye</p>
<p>Splendid mansions, beautiful clothes, delicious delicacies, beautiful wives and concubines - these are all children of gold. Whoever obtains gold can enjoy these four, and more, superior forms of life. If you want to enjoy this kind of life, please come to Shanghai. Gold is everywhere in Shanghai, just waiting to be picked up. Are readers skeptical? Listen to me!</p>
<p>Golden Barrel Grand Champagne, first prize 420,000, second prize 120,000, third prize 60,000, small prizes totaling 150,000. The fundraising amount for the Yu, Anhui, and Hubei disaster relief efforts totals 1,000,000 yuan, with prize money accounting for three-quarters of it. With so many opportunities to win prizes, isn't this gold for anyone to pick up? Aviation Highway Lottery, first prize 500,000 yuan, and the smaller prizes below are also more than the Golden Barrel lottery. The fundraising amount totals 5,000,000 yuan, scattering 3,000,000 yuan in prizes all over Shanghai, making the opportunity to pick it up even greater. In the past, someone picked up 200 yuan in the seven characters of "One Branch Seven Clever Ten Li Fragrance". Someone also picked up huge sums of money from the Pylon Guessing Game. Now, awaiting people to pick up, the Lux Soap Cigarette is electing a movie queen with a top prize of 2,000 yuan, the White Gold Dragon Cigarette, if you get all the poem riddles right, it has 500 yuan, the Company Brand Cigarette, twenty empty boxes in exchange for a top prize of 2,000 yuan, the Swirling Palace Brand Cigarette, twenty empty boxes in exchange for 500 yuan, and a certain bookstore is giving away racetrack tickets with book purchases. In addition, there are various ways of scattering gold. It's impossible to remember and write about everything at once. It's like this now, and there will be even more in the future, which is to be expected. It's also conceivable that layers of gold will pile up on the ground in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned 420,000 and 500,000 top prizes only require an investment of ten yuan to pick up. Other prizes require no capital at all. You can unexpectedly obtain them from items you must purchase in your daily life. In short, it rains gold and gold is everywhere in Shanghai. As long as you have the ability and good luck, you can pick up countless gold coins for you to hunt for splendid mansions, beautiful clothes, delicious delicacies, and beautiful wives and concubines. At the very least, it can save you from a temporary emergency.</p>
<h3>My Education</h3>
<p>— Lu</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>I didn't get what I wanted, so I cried.</p>
<p>"Good baby, don't cry, Grandma will buy you candy later," Grandma said, touching my head. I still didn't stop, I knew she was just哄 (hǒng:哄 is an important verb here meaning to coax or deceive with pleasant words) me.</p>
<p>"Good baby, don't let Dad hear you, or he'll hit you again."</p>
<p>I still kept crying.</p>
<p>"Third Brother, quickly close the door, the foreigners are coming! Third Brother, quickly close the door!" Grandma suddenly shouted. Third Brother really closed the door. "Baby isn't here, Baby isn't crying, foreigners don't come here. My Baby is really good, he's not crying!"</p>
<p>I was scared and buried my head in Grandma's arms, quickly stopping my crying.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>"Mom, the neighbor's son, A'Niu, hit me and stole my toy gun!" I cried, telling Mom.</p>
<p>"Good-for-nothing! Who told you to hang out with that little rogue? Who's going to pity you?" Mom scolded fiercely, pulling me out of the hall and taking the rattan whip, pretending to hit me.</p>
<p>"You little rogue, a nobody's kid who doesn't get disciplined, you hit people? You steal people's toy guns? Good, I won't let you off today, you little rogue!"</p>
<p>Mom pretended to hit me again, but I wasn't afraid. I knew Mom was using me to scold A'Niu.</p>
<p>A'Niu's mother heard this and also rushed out, scolding A'Niu.</p>
<p>"Did you steal someone else's stuff again? Quickly take it out. Where's the toy gun I bought for you a few days ago? Worthless thing! You lose your own things and then steal someone else's!"</p>
<p>Mom and A'Niu's mother argued for a long time before they stopped.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The time was autumn. The trees outside the courtyard were scattered by the wind, and many children were picking up fallen leaves to play with. I was very happy to see them and quietly opened the door to go out, but Mom saw me, grabbed my hand, and scolded:</p>
<p>"It's windy outside, you'll get sick again!"</p>
<p>"Mom, I want to play with fallen leaves."</p>
<p>"No, it's too dirty."</p>
<p>I cried again, and Mom put a piece of candy in my mouth.</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>The gongs and drums were loud outside. Today, "Ox-Head God" was parading through the streets. Mom, my sister, and I watched at the doorway.</p>
<p>"Mom, who is that person with the black face?" I asked, pointing to Mom.</p>
<p>"Don't point, quickly put your palms together and pray."</p>
<p>I put my palms together and prayed. Mom chanted: "The child is ignorant, please Ox-Head God teach him."</p>

<h3>The Life of Wu Ji (8) (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>8. "Just Marry Him"</p>
<p>"Where did you go? I've been waiting for you for ages."</p>
<p>As she stepped into the room, she saw Master Zhang lying on the bed, smoking opium. As soon as he saw her, he happily sat up and said to her with delight.</p>
<p>"Oh!" So she immediately forced a cheerful expression. "Oh, it's you! Where have you been all this time?"</p>
<p>As she sat near the bed, he embraced her. She then pressed his head to her chest, stroked his cheek with one hand, and took the opportunity to wipe away the tears from the corners of her eyes. She said softly:</p>
<p>"I almost died of missing you."</p>
<p>Just this simple sentence pierced Master Zhang's heart, because he hugged her even tighter. Afterward, she was pinned down on the bed, and Master Zhang pressed his whole body onto her, tearing off her clothes buttons as if fighting. After a round of caresses, she finally lay beside him while he smoked opium, exhausted and unable to lift her hands. When she carefully prepared a smoke bubble and was about to put the pipe to his lips, she saw that he was sound asleep. At this moment, she gave him a fierce smile, relieved to put down the pipe and rest.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a burst of angry and pleading voices came from the next room. She could tell that her companions were again suffering assault.</p>
<p>"No, don't do this! ... No ... I'll shout ... Haha ... Ouch ... Haha ... Someone come! ... No ... Someone's coming ... How embarrassing ... Ouch ... Hahahaha ..."</p>
<p>Then there was the sound of smashing bowls and plates, as the woman struggled to resist. Finally, the woman broke free, panting, and ran out the door amid a burst of laughter. Afterward, there was the strangely annoying sound of a huqin.</p>
<p>Miss Liu couldn't help but sigh heavily at this moment. She sat up and ran her hand through her greasy hair, finding that some strands were already out of place. Since she couldn't sleep anyway, she decided to go to the mirror and comb her hair.</p>
<p>She drank a cup of tea and then lit another cigarette, blowing out smoke rings of different sizes. The smaller rings went through the larger ones, and soon they all disappeared.</p>

<h3>Did Lili Damita Really Get Married?</h3>
<p>— Fu Tou</p>
<p>The only question that fans in Hollywood and across the United States want to know today is whether the beautiful European star Lili Damita is married or not. According to Lili herself, she has not been married or engaged. However, according to rumors from the German Ufa company, Lili Damita is indeed a married woman. Her husband is Willb Fritscb, the male lead who worked with her at Ufa, and they call their marriage "The Fairbanks Pickford Comdination of Europe." The two sides each hold their own, who should people believe?</p>
<p>What evidence does Ufa have for their rumor? It's quite interesting. It is said that two burglars, hearing that Ms. Damita had many diamonds, including one weighing twenty-five carats, decided to pay a visit to Damita's residence in the middle of the night. They climbed up to her apartment from the water pipe and sneaked into her bedroom. Suddenly the lights turned on, and they saw Lili sleeping in bed, in a sweet dream. A man was sitting by the bed, holding a pistol. The two burglars, feeling trapped, remembered that the newspaper had reported that Lili was unmarried, so they said to the man: "Will you let us go or not? If you don't let us go, we will reveal your secret."</p>
<p>"Go ahead, go ahead," the man said with a smile. "I'm not afraid of what the newspapers publish. Miss Damita and I have been secretly married for three months. I am Willb Fritscb, as you probably know." But Willb Fritscb eventually released the two burglars. Later, they told this story to others, and this is the basis for Ufa's claim that Lili is already married.</p>
<p>As soon as Lili Damita arrived in the United States, the first question that American reporters asked her was, "When is your husband coming to meet you?" Lili shook her head and said that she did not have a husband. People then asked her, if she didn't have a husband, why did Ufa say that she did? She said that it was Ufa's publicity stunt, and that the story of the burglars was also for publicity. People also asked her about her friendship with Willb Fritscb. She said, "Willb and I have collaborated in countless films. We work together day and night, performing romance in front of countless fans. Of course, we cannot remain indifferent, but we can perform romance and also break free from romance. When I was young, I even fell in love with a postal worker!"</p>
<p>"I don't know how many times the newspapers have published news of my marriage, I can't even remember. Among those men were dukes, counts, American millionaires, all sorts of people. But I am still free, even more free than the crows flying over my head!"</p>
<p>Lili Damita herself says that she has "no preconceived notions" about marriage on this trip to the United States. She admires American men. She says that American men are better than those in Berlin, not only are they better looking, but they are also smarter and more lively, unlike men from other countries. She feels comfortable and at ease among American men, without any restraint. She says that American women are also better looking than European women, with slender figures and beautiful faces.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Discussion of "Blood Letter"</h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>After "The Great Man" and "Her Heart", the Moon Light Company's "Blood Letter" has already been released at the Central Theater. I still take in this new work with the passion of cherishing domestic films. Although it still doesn't completely satisfy me, it is at least better than before. However, the consciousness in the story is still an ordinary love pursuit, and it cannot give us any new inspiration. There has also been no progress in terms of technique and expression. Here are some points in the play that I find inappropriate for discussion.</p>
<p>(1) Zhong Yuqing gives Yu Juan a small photo with the words "Yu Juan, my love" written on it. And her brother, Niu Er, insists on taking it for himself, even though he is said to be simple and foolish, it is still too artificial.</p>
<p>(2) After escaping from the fire pit, Yu Juan risks her life to find Yuqing, and suddenly encounters an "elephant" on the way. It is rare to have such wild animals in such a close place to the city, and the "elephant" has a huge ring in its nose, obviously kept by someone. In my opinion, this section is completely unnecessary.</p>
<p>(3) Yu Juan chews her finger to write a blood letter in the inn and swallows gold to commit suicide, but she is still alive at the grand reunion. How she was rescued is not explained, which is the biggest loophole.</p>
<p>(4) Yuqing takes Niu Er to Mo Zuomin's villa at night, jumps onto the roof, and walks like the wind, which has the flavor of old novels, and is a poisonous legacy of outdated films with great destruction and arson, which is disheartening.</p>
<p>(5) The furnishings in the room, such as the telephone and sofa, are extremely luxurious, while the outdoor scene is desolate with weeds and wild trees, making people wonder if it is a city or a remote village? The costumes are also very contradictory.</p>
<p>(6) The synopsis says that Yu Juan spent the night in an ancient temple, frightened by a thief, and obtained silver as travel expenses. But there is no such scene in the film. When Zuomin was killed, the synopsis said that the family members came out one after another, but there is no such fact in the film. All these are due to the director's lack of careful planning. If the audience does not read the synopsis, they will not know what it is about.</p>
<p>The above points are not impossible to remedy, and I hope the director will also correct them.</p>
<p>The Star Company's sound film "Powder Market" will soon be released at the New Light Theater. The director of the film is Mr. Zhang Shichuan, starring Hu Die, Gong Jianong, Yan Yuexian, etc.</p>
<p>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</p>
<h3>To be Made into a Movie</h3>
<p>The famous novel "Alice's Adventures in Wonderland" by Lewis Carroll will be made into a movie in Hollywood, with Mary Pickford playing the role of Alice. Douglas Fairbanks was in Rome riding a car to participate in the Italian Golf Champagne Competition. A Reuters reporter made a special visit to him. According to Fairbanks, the film is full of peaceful and serene air, and will be a new look in film dramas. In the play, only Pickford is the only real person, and the rest are dummies. Fairbanks said that he hopes to come to China to shoot the film next time, but all the equipment must be moved from Hollywood to the East, so at least one hundred and ten thousand yuan will be needed. However, judging from the current film market, it may be difficult to bear such a huge amount, etc. (Reuters Rome)</p>
<h3>Recent Domestic Films to be Released</h3>
<p>— Yi Yi</p>
<p>The General Trend of Film Themes</p>
<p>Since this time the film industry has had a revival opportunity, the domestic film industry has suddenly shown a booming atmosphere; and the general audience has also shifted their attention from Hollywood films, and expressed a grand and enthusiastic welcome to domestic films. Recently, according to my investigation, there will be four domestic films released in this district, which I will introduce to the readers below:</p>
<p>(1) Star Company's "Powder Market", directed by Zhang Shichuan, starring Hu Die, Gong Jianong, Yan Yuexian, etc. It will be released at the New Light Theater on the 14th of this month.</p>
<p>(2) Star Company's "Future", directed by Zhang Shichuan, starring Xuan Jinglin, Sun Min, Zhu Qiuhen, etc., will be released simultaneously at the Central Theater in Shanghai within the next ten days, the exact date is undetermined.</p>
<p>(3) Lianhua Company's "New Year's Eve", directed by Jiang Qifeng, starring Chen Yanyan, Liu Jiqun, Jiang Junchao; there is news that it will be released on the same day as "Powder Market" in Beijing.</p>
<p>(4) Tianyi Company's "Vitality", directed by Shao Zuiweng, starring Chen Yumei, Yuan Meiyun, Zhang Zhenduo; it will be released within ten days, the exact date is undetermined.</p>
<p>Of the above four films, two are sound films and two are silent films. One thing to note is that, except for the plot of "New Year's Eve" which the reporter is not very clear about, the other three films are all about women's issues. From this, we can see that since the release of "The Cry of Women", the theme of domestic films, "women's issues", seems to have become a general trend.</p>
<h3>"Where to Go?"</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>Art China Film Company's Debut Work</p>
<p>Art China Film Company's debut work, "Where to Go?" formerly titled "Homeless Chinese People", the whole play takes the suffering of the general people during the period from "September 18th" to "January 28th" as the theme, writing out the cruelty and conspiracy of international imperialists in oppressing weak nations. The screenwriter and director are both Mr. Chen Yu. In addition to wrestlers such as Zha Ruilong and Peng Fei, well-known ladies from the drama world such as Jinxiu Wen, Hong Dou, and Lei Mengna have also joined in cooperation. It is now heard that the film has completed the last scene - the war scene - yesterday.</p>
<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the editor, in the "Shanghai News in Brief" published in your esteemed publication on the ninth of this month, it was mentioned that Xue Juexian was very disappointed after Bai Jinlong was banned. After investigation, the Bai Jinlong film was co-produced by our company and Mr. Xue. Since it was submitted to the Film Inspection Committee for inspection, it has never been banned. We hereby correct this and kindly request that the original letter be published as is.</p>
<h3>A Collection of Local Intelligence</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jingzhi</p>
<p>Lianhua's "Maternal Light" has been filming for more than a month, and yesterday they went to Hangzhou to take external scenes. This external scene is the scenery of the Nanyang mining area, so they brought a lot of Nanyang trees to plant, in order to be realistic.</p>
<p>Jinan Company's sound film "Winning Glory for the Country" has been completed. This film is a combination of martial arts and love. It will be able to meet the people of Shanghai soon.</p>
<p>A pair of comedic old partners - Hoersay and Wheeler - arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday and ran to Yiwei to dance. Coincidentally, our Queen Hu Die was also dancing gracefully, so this pair of comedic old partners looked at her carefully as if they had discovered a new continent, but Hu Die was a little shy.</p>
<p>The foreign films that will be coming to Shanghai soon include "So Africa", co-starring Hoersay and Wheeler, "Sailor's Luck", co-starring James Dunn and Sally Eilers, and "42nd Street", starring Bebe Daniels and Warner Baxter.</p>
<p>Star Company's "Iron Plate Red Tears Record" is nearing completion. It is heard that the new film after this film is "On the Fuchun River", directed by Hong Shen.</p>
<p>Lianhua Company has recently produced a "Shanghai Grand View", the content of which is entirely Shanghai scenes. The results are quite impressive. It is heard that it will be released with the main film soon.</p>
<h3>The Secrets (7) of the Film Novel</h3>
<p>— Cairo</p>
<p>"Mary!" John shouted outside. "Shenxiang is hurt, come quickly!"</p>
<p>Mary seemed to wake up from a dream. She quickly put Little John's stiff body into the cradle; straightened up, wiped the tears from her eyes with the back of her hand, and ran out. She was bandaging Shenxiang's wound when suddenly the house was filled with thick smoke. She looked up at the skylight on the roof and saw Red-Faced Jack climbing on the skylight, one hand holding a torch setting fire, and the other hand holding a pistol ready to open fire on John. As if divinely inspired, Mary quickly took Shenxiang's gun from the side and fired at Red-Faced Jack with a bang. Red-Faced Jack fell in from the skylight like a dead crow and died on the ground.</p>
<p>Outside the door, there was the sound of horses galloping. Then there were shouts and gunshots. After listening for a while, John suddenly shouted happily, "That's Dr. McGoffin, bringing the local police!" This new force beat the gang of cattle thieves to pieces, and they fled in all directions. A fierce battle that was almost on the verge of danger also came to an end. John also won a complete victory. Mary's contribution, of course, was also considerable.</p>
<p>The next day, John and Mary buried Little John's body in joy and sorrow, came back to repair the house, tidy up the utensils, and prepared to recreate the family.</p>
<p>It seemed that heaven was afraid that their love was not strong, so it deliberately added various hardships; after they had gone through many trials and dangers, their love could not be shaken at all, so "heaven's heart" also turned around. Since the fierce battle with Red-Faced Jack, John's luck has turned. From then on, everything went smoothly, and John's wealth and reputation increased a thousand miles a day. After Little John died, Little William was born, and Otterley, Susan, and Robert were born one after another. At this time, Shenxiang, the children called him Old Uncle, was no longer an employee, but a member of the John Caton family, receiving extremely preferential treatment. But Shenxiang had one thing.</p>
<p>He hated the fact that whenever there was a banquet, he had to wear a formal suit with a stiff collar, which made his movements and breathing very uncomfortable. He thought to himself that for the sake of Mary and John, he was not afraid to go through fire and water; what he was most afraid of was formal attire with a stiff collar.</p>
<p>This day was another day of a grand banquet. Caton had been nominated as the candidate for governor of California, and this was the first celebration dance. Shenxiang also wore a formal suit and walked around among the guests, listening to the announcer announcing the names of the distinguished guests. Suddenly, a beautiful Spanish young woman came in, and the announcer announced her name, "Miss Martinez." Shenxiang happened to be standing next to a pair of male and female guests. He heard them whispering. The woman said, "How dare she be so bold!" The man said, "Caton is crazy, bringing this kind of woman into his house!"</p>
<p>Shenxiang looked around for John and Mary. John looked ashamed, Mary also felt uneasy, and Miss Martinez was approaching the hosts. (To be continued)</p>
