<h3>整肅軍紀</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>報載蔣委員長爲杜絕軍隊辦差流弊計。特嚴令整肅軍紀。誥誡官兵。視民如傷。不得憑藉武力。肆意敲榨人民。此其言不特爲目前舉國人民所切盼。而在此匪亂如麻大軍進勦之日。更具有極重要之意義。故敢藉蔣委員長之言而一論之。</p>
<p>我國養兵二百數十萬。年費國帑三四萬萬元。占總歲出百分之八十以上。而其他各省駐軍之就地徴發者尙不在内。人民之所以竭其全力以供養軍隊。其唯一希望。不外欲使軍隊爲民衆自身之武力。能保衛國家維護地方人民耳。然而回顧二十年來之事實。則軍隊不獨不爲民衆之武力。而且參加内戰。常使戰區人民。遭受家破人亡之苦痛。即在平時。亦不免有恃勢凌人之舉動。偶有不遂禍患立至。如蔣委員長所言憑藉武力肆意敲榨者。因是人民遂畏官兵如虎。而人民與軍隊間發生隔閡矣。</p>
<p>故今日而能整肅軍紀。人民固已如大旱之望雲霓。而在此大軍進勦匪區之時。各師旅果能秋毫不犯。到處撫綏災民。體卹艱難。慰問疾苦。則不獨可以轉換往日人民對於軍隊之印象。抑且可以收人民軍隊打成一片之大效。過去北伐時軍隊與人民恊作之事實。彰彰猶在吾人記憶中也。</p>
<p>然則軍紀之所以不肅。癥結又何在乎。今之一般論者。每謂士兵智識低淺。或謂兵士餉糈微薄。此固皆言之有理。然而智識低淺之士兵。豈即絕對無法以善用之歟。餉糈微薄。豈亦絕對無法維持其生活歟。吾人以爲智識低淺之士兵、若有善良之長官爲之指導。曉以愛國之大義。不驅爲私人之工具。亦可化爲國家有用之健兒。至於餉糈微薄。則在今日生活程度之下。兵士應得之偉給。若果能按月放發。則即不能有富裕之生活。亦尙不致有凍餒之虞。所慮者士兵之餉糈旣微薄。而又復爲長官所截扣。或至經年拖欠而不發。則兵士眞將無以維持其生活。而非法之念以生。是其過皆在爲長官者之不善訓練。與祇圖自利而不能專賣兵士也。且爲將領者升官發財之念切。則愛國愛民之念少。而人民與軍隊間。有若何深切之關係。亦且無暇顧問。結果乃形成人民與軍隊離而爲二之現象。</p>
<p>故在今日而求軍紀之整肅。吾人以爲應先使各軍隊長官。幡然覺悟。努力排除過去之錯誤。然後以嚴厲之軍令。整肅部隊。一改往日之積弊。民衆與軍隊能相愛相親相扶助。而後軍隊與民衆打成一片。而後軍隊乃眞成爲民衆之武力。如此則不獨勦匪之勝利可期。即外侮亦不足畏矣。各軍將領其速深體蔣委員長之言可也。</p>

<p>（日内瓦）鴉片顧問委員會日本代表橫山今日對外傳日本在阿比西尼亞獲有種植罌粟之讓與權一節、發重要之聲明、據謂渠因此項消息引起合理的驚動情感、曾電東京詢問詳情、茲悉乃一貧乏之冒險家名木田者、自稱已在阿比西尼亞獲有讓與權、藉以自榮、此乃一種不能取信於人之策略、渠願昭示世人、以釋羣疑、無論如何、阿比西尼亞政府必禁止在其境内種植罌粟云、今日午後鴉片委員會通過詢問關於海牙公約第四章之實施各條之草稿、將送致中政府與中國得租界當局、草報告中有中國之現局、尤其爲該地設立秘密製造毒藥廠之危險、實爲對中國與對全世界甚大憂慮之總源等語、（七日路透電）</p>
<h3>日貨無孔不入　向伊拉克發展</h3>
<p>（倫敦）　商務部接得英國駐伊拉克使館商務參贊寄來之報告、於今晨公佈、内稱日本貨物在伊拉克市場從事競爭、大見發展、棉布商人向與英國孟却斯德交易者現多向日本購貨、且伊拉克政府製備軍裝所用布匹、亦改向東京定購、該商務參贊指出若干數字、可證明日貨輸出伊拉克之增加、一九三零至三一年與一九三一至三二年度相較、日布輸入伊拉克自二九八○○○公尺增至三二五○○○公尺、但英國布匹輸往伊拉克則仍維持原狀云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>白宮藍廳羅斯福延見俄外長　談話充滿友好精神　美俄復交旦夕實現</h3>

<h3>希特勒定明日全國廣播演說　喚起民衆擁護現政府　退盟問題待投票公决　内閣改組說無稽</h3>
<p>（柏林）　本星期五日將爲此次國會選舉及人民對於德國退出國聯問題之自决大投票之最高潮、是日下午自一時至二時、全國之各工廠將一律停止工作一小時、齊集公共塲所靜聆無線電之公　總理希特勒氏之演說、希氏此次演說之大意、約　喚醒德國全民之一致擁戴現政府、爭取世界之平等和平、並表示德國全民之團結一致云、同時德國全德之交通一聞鐘鳴一下、即將一律停止、一切行人亦均止步、靜默一分鐘、而各大小工廠則將齊鳴汽笛、報告總理演說詞之開始云、再則此次演說復將同時在各學校家庭廣播、故可云實屬空前之廣播示威舉動、並聞總統興登堡亦將於星期六日向全國人民致訓詞、此實爲興氏自上次勞工紀念節日致詞後之第一次、故尤爲人民所重視云、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）　近日外間傳說謂德國本月十二日大選舉之後、德内閣勢將改組云云、茲據此處可靠方面宣佈、此說實全無根據、蓋德内閣今猶一致擁護希特勒之政策、可云内外一致、毫無動搖之說也、（七日國民電）</p>

<p>羅馬　此間人士對於普魯士總理戈林來意之舉、一致認爲德國覺悟之第一步、因德國自退出國聯會及軍縮會議之後、各國淡然置之、德國自覺在外交上不能長此孤立也、意國人士以爲戈林之來、不僅在求意政府之援助、其目的有更爲具體者、蓋意大利與英法國交親善、德國欲援引四强條約藉意國之力、以與英法相接近也云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>浦東陸家宅　慘殺母女兩命始末　十號巡丁鄭萬明實爲主兇　本案絕非盜案係挾仇報復</h3>
<p>浦東陸家宅茂業里内屠民阜寗人胡長明家、於本月一日晚十時許、忽被暴徒三名、闖進其家、刦去鈔洋二百元及鍍金首飾數項、並槍殺胡妻于氏·及胡女秀珍·兩名、當胡妻臨死時、曾呌出殺我者係十號也一語、於是公安局即認定此語爲本案之線索、連日經警察與偵探搜捕之下、確悉此案主犯即係所謂十號之巡丁、現充租界巡捕、並先後拘獲要犯及嫌疑犯數名、蓋本案逈非盜案係該十號挾仇報復、故意以搶刦遮飾其惡計耳、茲將顚末分誌於下、</p>
<h3>十號巡丁</h3>
<p>所謂十號者、前在浦東祥生鐵廠充十號巡了、現在公共租界百老滙路口仁興里爲看門巡捕、號碼爲一二零六號、其人名鄭萬明、年在四十開外、係清江人、家住浦東陸家宅護塘路四十四號、與事主胡長明本屬相識、昔日鄭曾向胡爲其獨養愛女（即已死之秀珍）作伐、强欲許配與鄭之外甥爲妻、卒以胡妻（即已死之于氏）竭力反對而作罷、鄭知胡昏庸老朽、無能爲力、獨遭于氏之阻撓、而事未如願、遂懷恨於心、慘案發生之動機、即種於此、</p>
<h3>慘案發生</h3>
<p>最近胡爲其愛女招一意贅婿以爲後嗣、贅婿過門之日、大張筵席、招宴親友、事先爲鄭所知、乃於上月二十八日約其友人李文起·姜傳仁等、至家密議報復惡計、當胡家請酒之翌晚、鄭卽持盒子砲領導先入、姜則追隨其後、李在門外望風、於是血案卽在此一刹那間發生、鄭除槍殺胡·妻·母女二人之外、並刦取鈔洋二百元、向東首田野間逃去、</p>
<h3>極大嫌疑</h3>
<p>出事之後、胡神智糢糊、公安局曾訉其胡妻臨死時所說之該十號、與本案有無嫌疑、胡仍極力爲十號（卽鄭萬明）辯白、堅稱鄭與渠甚爲友善、决不會出此手段、定指殺其妻女者、係不相識之盜匪、但公安局仍不信其言、由張鳴欽區長嚴着警探偵查、事越三四日、胡神智稍定、猛憶起出事之前二小時許、約在晚間八時左右、有附近鄰居李文起、至胡家中討冷水、胡正在晚餐、卽將李留住同酌、李乘間詢胡家産有否一千餘金、胡竭力否認、李又云無一千、前六七百必有、胡一笑置之、同時又有鄰居姜傳仁（綽號姜大辮子）亦至胡家中付會錢、不料事隔兩小時許、卽行出事、以此想像之境况、李姜二人、實有極大嫌疑、乃重復投至三區請行緝究、</p>
<h3>聞風逃逸</h3>
<p>張區長據報、卽派劉煥升巡官及警長郭永良、帶警會同偵緝領班張應聘·偵緝員蔣彬如·王繼恒等、馳往陸家宅茂業里四十一號李之居處、將李文起拘獲、復將嫌疑犯宋金玉·郭一榮·史玉才·等三名、一併帶區、李到區後、卽精係鄭萬明令其同去、姜傳仁亦去等語、區長復派員將姜拘案、一面並命張領班探員率同各探、至陸家宅護塘路四十四號鄭萬明住屋内捕鄭、至則鄭家門實濶開、而屋内空無一人、惟家具絲毫未移、知鄭已聞風合家逃避、庭至公共租界捕房調查、得悉鄭於出事之晚、並未到差上崗、係請别人替工、故益知其犯案無疑、乃報由張區長先將鄭之住房發封、一面仍着各探警上緊嚴緝、務將主犯鄭萬明獲案法辦、</p>
<h3>各犯供詞</h3>
<p>自此案從犯及嫌疑犯數名拘區後、卽由張區長分别嚴鞫、據李文起供稱、年三十三歲、山東滕縣人、業碼頭上扛夫、初一度狡賴、並未隨鄭搶欵殺人、後始直認不諱、據稱鄭做巡捕之外、尙在外間放皮球錢、我曾借其皮球錢洋七元、每天須上利銅元廿八枚、惟我甚窮苦、迄今三年餘、本利合算約須百數十元、至今本利示償、上月廿八日、鄭忽約我至其家中談話、鄭劈頭卽向我索債、我答一時無力歸還、鄭乃稱汝跟我做一椿、事、不但欠債可以不還、並可發一筆小財云云當時姜傳仁亦參加計議、計定後、三人同去實行、迨目的旣達、三人遂逃至事先約家之吳家廳地方田野間會集　我當場分得五十元是實、請求從寛發落等語、據姜傳仁供稱、江西榆縣人住陸家宅五福路七十二號、開江樓茶館、堅不承認有夥刦殺人情事、據宋金玉供稱、我與李文起住於一屋、惟李之犯罪、我絕未知悉、郭一榮供、住法租界太平橋四十三號、在障公館内當差是日至宋金玉家找友、忽遭逮捕、又據史王才供稱、住茂業里廿八號、業烟廠小工、當時我在李文起門首白相忽被警探將我捕區各等情、旋區長查得代鄭犯覓保租屋之人、係鄭之妻舅鹽城人房武門、住在護塘浜十號、復派警將房帶案、飭將一干人、連同最先發生慘案時投區報告之事主鄰居清江人于連山、一併備文於昨解送公安總局訉究、</p>

<h3>敵兵入寇而内鬨依然</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>▲侵略野心方入手却憐釁起在蕭牆</p>
<p>國貨年的日子，去了一大半，大家檢點過有多少成績？正在抱愧無地，而十月三十一日東京電，有如下的紀載：</p>
<p>最近外務省綜合各方情報，謂中國之抵制日貨運動，漸次消沉，尤以天津，濟南，青島爲中心之華北，竟與九一八事變以前，毫無變更之趨勢。長江一帶，近亦轉佳，外務省通商局鑒於日本從來對華貿易，漫無統制，須計劃創設一大公司，而付予獨占中國貿易之特權。業已開始調查。各方一致主張組成對華出口公司之統制機關，確有必要，不久勢必實現云。</p>
<p>此敵兵入寇的惡耗，磨刀霍霍，咄咄逼人，讀到這段消息，眞是汗流浹背，毛骨悚然，可是同時又得到三段消息：</p>
<p>一·是三山會館與國貨介紹總所之糾紛，一方說他阻運國貨，一方說他奪人飯碗。</p>
<p>二·是蚌埠商界與國貨展覽會的衝突。</p>
<p>三·是徐州商界反對國貨展覽會的傾銷國貨。</p>
<p>這三段内鬨的消息，同時在報上發表，不由地使人痛心至於流淚。國貨介紹總所謂：「作國貨之障礙的，不障礙於敵人，却障礙於本國人，反對國貨的，不反對於敵人，却反對於本國人。天下最痛心之事，寗有過於此者。」明明爲國貨，爲純粹國貨，正努力推銷之不暇，何忍予以阻遏，出以反對。在此提倡國貨聲中，有此現象，苟非出以誤會，或别有用心，天下决無此理。萬一因利害上的衝突，也應泯其私利，顧全大局更不應顧了飯碗，剥削工商，在這國貨危急千鈞一髮時代，凡有血氣有良心的，個個要放大目光，移其對付本國人的心理，及本國的人同業的人競爭的觀念一致向外注意，打倒本國人，打倒同業，這是卑劣的行爲，不算好漢，是果是好漢，要想法怎樣可以抵制敵貨？怎樣可以防制敵貨的改頭換面？怎樣可以制裁奸商的包銷日貨？把這種心思，這種筆墨，這種力量，統用在對抗敵貨上面，纔可以對得起社會，對得起國家，對得起自己。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>貨品走樣嗎？</h3>
<p>— 何躬行</p>
<p>國貨最大弊病，是走樣，兜銷時之樣品，和交貨時之躉批品，是走樣了，一廠初次出品，和二次或三次出品，更是走樣了。若說一批好一批的走樣，這是貨品「改良」「進步」表現，是國貨早經發達，無再勞社會上一般人之提倡矣。無奈是一批不及一批，若逢銷路興盛，趕造貨品時，更是愈造愈下，竟至「具體而微，」於是（退貨）（罰欵），至糾紛不已，這究竟是何等原因？</p>
<p>若說製造者之均習於偷工减料，則未免一筆抺煞，大是寃枉。除少數不顧大體之廠主，因急於圖利，或不免粗製濫造外，其他幾無不希望其出品之精良，使人永久的樂於購用，但其結果，往往不能如願，依然大走其樣。致使用者唾駡，製造者喪氣，這究竟是何等原因，質言之，實用原料缺少標凖化而已。</p>
<p>近年我國國貨製造業，雖日見發達，然其需用之各種原料，仍多仰給外洋，又因資本關係，每無力大批購進，大都待需要時，零星購買，原料旣欠整齊，貨品又多惡劣，於是今日用德貨，明日用法貨，其他英俄日美等貨，幾至輪流購用，産地旣屬互異，性質自難相同，舉凡性質不同樣原料，欲其製造同樣貨品，是爲事實上所不許，此國貨貨品走樣之最大原因也。人贊英美烟公司所製造之紅錫包捲烟，謂能數十年未走樣，要知其所使用之捲烟原料，亦數十年如一日也。</p>
<p>今上海國貨工廠，有數千家，而製造原料者，寥寥可數。因一是「已成品」，甲地滯銷，可銷至乙地，張三不買，可賣給李四，姑不論其結果之盈虧與否，然其必能售銷則無疑。一是「未成品」旣不能普遍推銷，又無法單獨使用，購買者，祇需要用該貨之若干工廠而已。因其製造原料時之原料，同一缺少標凖化，早令購者懷疑，其不能合用，况又有價廉於我之外貨，環伺四周，來與競賣，萬一不能銷售，儲存廠中，幾與泥土等耳，毫無他用，人非呆戇者，又何苦作此無把握之營業。</p>
<p>故今日欲求國貨之發達須先求國貨貨品之能始終如一，欲求國貨貨品始終如一，須先求製造原料工業之大發達。使用原料，旣須認定牌號，製造原料，尤須認定産地，旣認某種原料，比較以某産地爲最適合者，若非該地該料，産量斷絕，萬不能輕易變更，從此國貨因原料的標準化，而出品始終如一。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>爲國貨展覽會正告國貨廠商</h3>
<p>— 周成勛</p>
<p>顧名思義，國貨展覽會眞正目的，在乎把國産的製品很詳細很完備的介紹出來，用有系統有解釋的陳列法，使一切民衆獲得認識國貨的機會，而盡量提起服用國貨的思想來，然一考實際，七八年來各地國貨展覽會普遍的舉辦，國貨廠商努力參加，是否是收到了上述的效能，這很抽象的問題姑且不談，但是我們在事實上所感受到的，却有不少痛心的反應，而不得不秉着忠實的態度嚴正的對各國貨廠商下一些忠告。</p>
<p>怎樣的痛心反應呢？就是有一部份國貨廠商，根本没有了解國貨展覽會眞正的意義，而認爲參加國貨展覽會，無異臨時設一販售塲所，無異多一出清底貨的機遇，於是草草將事，唯利是視，歷年來各國貨展覽會舉行，只見希圖牟利的工廠日益增多，眞正抱有主義工作的國貨廠商，漸形減少，而各地販賣商店，爲了國貨展覽會到處賤賣傾銷，擾害穩定的市情，也引起不滿的反感。</p>
<p>最近蚌埠商界高高喊着「打倒傾銷，歡迎展覽，」的口號，拒絕本埠國貨廠商去舉行國貨展覽會，就是一個很好的例證，他們拒絕的理由是：内地農村經濟枯衰到不可收拾的地步，購買力何</p>
<h3>敬告讀者</h3>
<p>本刊問世，已有四十四期，以提倡國貨之微忱，深得同志之贊美，今後擬於材料及體裁方面，益求改進，材料重實際不尙空談，文筆取生動不取繁瑣，而立意尤貴新潁，體裁力求活潑，以後來稿，專取實際生動，饒有興趣，使讀者可生效力爲指歸。字數在二三百字至多以五百字爲度。長篇空論，語意平常，毫無精彩，或過涉宣傳者，一槪不登，務請注意。（編者）</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>等的薄弱，如果抱着出清存貨的目的而來，非但遠背國貨展覽會的眞意，傾銷的結果也一定失敗的，要宣揚國貨，不在乎發售，而在乎完備的展覽，這幾句切中時弊的話，眞是値得各國貨工廠深切考慮而急急加以革興的敎訓。</p>
<p>我們對於領導各國貨工廠奔波跋涉的一切集團機關的精神是很佩服的，但對於誤解國貨展覽會的國貨廠商的確抱有莫大的遺憾，我認爲此後的國貨展覽會必得改變一下目標，切實實行下面的原則來：</p>
<p>一、絕對不能發賣　二、嚴格審查參加工廠出品的程度　三、關於國貨産地産地品質製造程序，用種種方法介紹於民衆　四、盡量指導當地販賣商店，關於銷售與採購方法的利害、五、普遍設立國貨陳列所，使民衆永留影象。</p>
<p>照上面五點原則實行，在製造販賣銷費三方面都蒙受很大的利益，國貨展覽會眞正意義，也得明顯表示，否則依舊抱着出清底貨的念頭，到處開展覽會，弄得東也拒絕，西也不歡迎，試問國貨前途還甚問聞麽？</p>
<p>貢献意見</p>
<h3>幾種急待自製的國貨代用品</h3>
<p>— 枕木</p>
<p>近年來對於國貨代用品的製造，努力得成績尙佳，但是未經國人設廠自製的代用品，還有不少，仍然惟外貨是求：現在把需用最殷的幾種小工業，羅列於左，以待有志有力者，從速發起籌備，研究製造，而挽利權之外溢。</p>
<p>▲鋼筆桿與筆尖丨是小物也，筆桿每支大洋一角，佳者三四角，筆尖每只大洋一分，佳者四五分，以全國運用鋼筆者計之，聯合黨政工商，及學校機關，總有一千五百萬人要需用，估之每人每年消耗筆桿二支筆尖六只，則年耗需五六百萬元之鉅，或許事實上尙不止此，這如今都流入外人之手，豈可不收回哉！</p>
<p>▲鍍鋅鋼鐵丨從申報年鑑上看到那鍍鋅鋼鐵的輸入，年達八十萬担，實足驚人，其中白鐵皮（即鉛皮）佔四○九○○○担，白鐵絲佔二三八○○○担，而吾國呢，當然出産毫無，不過從另一方面，吾們看到鐵礦的輸出是九八二七○五○担，雖不能說盡變了鍍鋅鋼鐵回來，但國人若能留下一部來自製，也是抵制多多。</p>
<p>▲顔色染料丨靛青顔料，在歐戰前均仰給於德，戰後則英日各有競爭，到底吾們自己是尙未出貨，而每年從海關上吃進四千萬兩關銀的外國顔料。</p>
<p>▲白糖丨我國的本糖均非潔白，故上白糖全係仇貨居多，雖現有民國糖廠者爲國人自設，但競爭上之結果尙未可逆料：希有力者有以助之。</p>
<p>▲鐘丨諸位把家裏的鐘看看，泰半有日本製造的英文字，這是何等可慘，現在吾希望中國有造鐘的工塲，因這不比錶工業之精細，稍粗些是没有關係的，顯熱心人速即從事。</p>
<p>▲鉛筆丨近日市上好像有一家國貨的大華鉛筆出世，不勝慶幸，但是要單靠一家，那是抵制不了Ｖenus及施德樓的，而且廠在香港，那需要的木材，石屋，沙泥等原料，恐不見得能純粹國貨，幷非記者苛求，願意有人在中國内地近林之處設廠，豈吾國所藏之石墨亦甚豐富也。</p>
<p>以上種種，僅就記者目中以爲用廣而需亟之物，其他尙多，限於篇幅，不及備舉耳。</p>
<h3>我們需要農人們來認識國貨</h3>
<p>— 姚星墅</p>
<p>事實上已告訴我們的老大中國，是生産落後的國家，因此，有如今的同胞們，口口聲聲在說着提倡國貨，可是不幸得很，頻年來的外侮内亂，已形成了我國農村經濟破産的象徴，那怕你喊得「提倡國貨」，震天價響，但事實上還是貨倉裏滿堆了你的國貨，不得儘量傾銷，當然囉，這經濟力的宰制，比任何一切的力量來得可怕，所以我們要提倡國貨，應先從農村方面去着手宣傳。</p>
<p>我們不要單靠在大都會裏搖旗呐喊養提倡國貨，我們要擴大到農村裏去宣揚國貨，我們也不要單靠幾個廣告原吹牛，而同時又須顧慮到國貨的改進，因爲現代的奢侈都會中，那些醉生夢死的同胞們，儘多着了些裝痴作聾的十足準洋奴，他們飲食起居，無一而非舶來品，雖然也有覺悟的人們，丢掉他一九三三年式的洋裝，來穿價廉物美的土布，但是，讀者們！請你閉上了眼睛，想一想，眞在提倡國貨的同胞，究竟有多少？</p>
<p>因此，現在這國貨年，雖已過去了四分之三的時候，已往成績，且不去猜測是否成功？今後我們不妨變更一個目標，轉到農村裏去活動，雖說這年頭，我們的農村經濟破産，農民已買不起東西，但，我想至少能對「國貨」兩字，使農民們有相當的認識吧！</p>
<p>参觀筆記</p>
<h3>國貨蠟紙工廠參觀記</h3>
<p>— 屛南</p>
<p>參觀國貨工廠，爲吾人最快樂之舉，在參觀前有感想，在參觀後更多感想。余利用國難期中之雙十節，應友人約至南市勤業文具公司，訪其經理陳葆笙君，請我參觀國貨蠟紙工廠，親予領導至董家渡，渡浦至張家浜上岸，乘人力車東行，約里許達胡家木橋，望見田野中有廠屋一所，屋頂大書勤業文具公司第一工廠字樣，廠長李君霽雲招待甚摯，陳君云有第二工廠，設在浙之桐廬縣桐君山之麓，採集原料，專造蠟紙原紙，有男女工人一百五六十人，均供膳宿，因廠所距鄕村較遠也。此第一工廠，則爲上蠟與裝發等工作。男女工人僅五十餘人，語已遂導至工塲，分部參觀，蠟紙部有四開印字機二架，專印蠟紙之綫限與三童放紙鳶之商標，是項商標，又名風箏牌，待墨瀋乾時，即運入上蠟室。上蠟室有屋四間，一爲配合蠟料及鎔化室，所用器具，僅鍋爐與鐵盒等件而已。其餘三間，則置上蠟機六架，機下爲火爐，火候頗旺。工人二對坐於機之左右側面，彼一人取印就綫限之白紙納諸機中，機轉動時，而另一人則揭蠟紙而出之，用人口風輕輕一吹，放於架上，是上蠟之工作告成矣。陳君云，爐中火候，有一定之限度，過與不及，均屬不行。故每機均附有熱度表，藉爲標凖，庶免紙上蠟分，有輕重厚薄之弊。此外則爲整理裝筒等室，次至原紙部，其造紙工具，放置井然。陳君云，原紙工作每年僅有五個月，在溫熱天時，則全部停工，因原紙是運用膠質工作，故此時無從工作也。次至五彩粉筆部，見設有石膏化鍊灶，研磨，銅模篩櫃等器，後至木工鋼具部，則見鋼筆鋼版橡膠棍，絹絲網等之製作配合，頗爲忙碌，陳君乃以配裝完備之油印機一具，展開木箱之蓋，附着印字方框，蒙以絲絹，謂以保護蠟紙，可以多印一二百張云。機鈕裝置彈簧，印後放手，即自彈開，箱中半邊，又有複蓋，揭起展開，成一墨盤，擱於箱旁，運用油墨，至爲方便。箱内則格貯橡膠棍，蠟紙鋼版，鋼筆等應用文具，箱外釘有皮鈕，便於携帶，陳君云鋼版經過多次改善，現已可寫山水人物之畫，　出數紙作品，傳觀之下，頗堪稱羨，是誠國貨工廠進步之一證也。</p>

<p>（五）不要提倡</p>

<p>（六）感情的因素</p>

<p>▲上半時　英軍之實力平淡無奇、故起手卽見高低、往來塲中歷十五分鐘、雙方均無樹立、小虎曹秋亭與右翼賈幼良在踢小球時代、以搭擋極熟、故昨日聯絡極見活躍、在袁慶武兩度失手之復、賈幼良東郊發腿、石特釘梢不及、海馥特欲擒故縱、誰知弄巧成拙、引狼入室、球入中路十二碼所在落下、陳洪光立時趕到、砰然一脚、紀錄遂開、此後英軍陣地、遍見東華旗幟、許竟成與洪光不時東窺西探、使對方感到極度不安、無已、小賈捲土重來、勾入中樞、落點極妙、陳洪光奔至迎之以頭、西門心猿意馬、再失一城開球再戰、英軍愈見一蹶不振、相持四十分時、曹秋亭達陷重防、又爲洪光打入一球、上半時四比○、</p>
<p>▲下半時　東華見得球如探囊取物、未免生驕敵之心、下半時開塲未久、中衛三將、因助前鋒進攻、後防空虛、爲石特偷渡、霎時闖入内地、一脚傳中惠壽祿、隔山開砲、陸鍾恩心不在焉、竟致失掉一球、陳氏兄弟聯袂南征、西門撲救險球、爲最精彩一幕、拚命三郎陳虞添、自是斵輪老手、得屠博士接濟、亦亦大功、未五分鐘、曹小虎與賈幼良、彼此呼應、越過中衛線、秋亭使足勁道球出如矢、西門挽球無效、成五對一局面、混戰良久、又爲英軍中鋒馥倫遠遠射入一球、成二對五、戰局乃告終結、兩軍陣線如後、</p>

<h3>新村</h3>
<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>我常聽見人說，要改良農民生活，增進農民福利，須建設新村。但是實際上，還没有見到足以達到這個奢望的新村在那裏。蘇州的善人橋，是有一個新村的，正在計畫，正在進行，還没有成熟。但是我聽見一位曾經到過那裏的人說，現在只用全力在敎育，其他建設無暇及此，並且没有堅固的敎育基礎，儘有崇高富麗的建築物，不久就得崩毁的。所以新村的建設，是一椿細針密縷，像老太婆切襪底一般的工作，不是大刀闊斧，粗心浮氣的計畫趕得成的。</p>
<p>前天有吳江的敎育界，到崑山的徐公橋和無錫的西門外去參觀了還來，對我說，徐公橋的一瞥，感到一種印象，便是「村無閒人，路無廢物」。據說連派出所的警察，也空得無可警察。至於最普遍的烟賭，絕對不能在方方數十里内逗留、一個不相識的兜銷鴉片烟的，給他他驅逐出境。試問其他的農村，有這種印象麽？無錫西門外，是茅屋世界，那些苦力，衣食不遑，奚暇識字讀書。起初施敎者唇焦舌敝，他們還是掉頭不顧，難得有幾個來帮場圍，坐幾分鐘。後來便實行從前盧殿虎的茅亭講學，在茅屋的集團裏，建築一個物質同樣而略具科學化的茅屋來。施敎者就住在那裏，和他們朝夕相見，等他們工作完畢，然後施敎。一方面再和工廠的領袖，合辦一個託兒所，使各有歸宿，不到一年，氣象大新。那天他們去參觀，時候尙早，未見施敎，却有兩個黄包車夫在那裏着象棋，據說他們本來一個字也不識的，現在可以念標語了。</p>
<p>我們在城市裏，常見有錢讀書的子弟，漫不經心，儘你言之諄諄，非但聽之藐藐，甚至要辯之嘵嘵，到不如去墾荒地，費若干心力，就得到若干收穫呢。</p>
<h3>酒錢和康密興</h3>
<p>— 時春</p>
<p>有人說現在的社會完全是錢的社會，什麽都在金錢上進出，這是很確然的，尤其是在大都市中，出外去無論幹什麽事，都要化上幾個無影無蹤的錢，如果洋氣十足的呌做康密興（有所謂洋涇浜的稱爲康姆遜，實即康密興之誤，其義爲回扣，然在上海皆用作酒力小賬之統稱），不帶洋氣的就稱爲酒錢。</p>
<p>我記得初次出外旅行，上火車的時，因爲帶了些行李，車上的脚夫向我討酒錢，那時我年紀尙小，就問他要吃多少酒，拿我同行的親戚笑彎了腰，後來才知道酒錢不是眞拿去喝酒的，但是酒錢這名稱出自何典，至今不得而知，最奇怪的在德國亦有酒錢Ｔrinkgeld的名稱，殆中外一例之故，然而美國或英國則稱爲Ｔip同德國又不同，日本則根本没有酒錢的惡習，所以並没有這名稱，那是最比較便利的。</p>
<p>在上海，一到節端，就酒錢一項已大有可觀，從家裏說起，街上掃拉圾的清道夫，倒馬桶的倒老爺管弄堂的更夫，看弄堂的警察，到了冬天更有馬路上喊火燭小心的一類人，都一個個擠上前來伸手要錢，便宜的幾個銅元，貴的洋錢進出，每一節上必要安排過去，比欠了的債更重要，如是在商家做事，那實在要命，從出店司務茶房以至於開電梯看門的，那一個不要酒錢，如果少了些，背後駡幾聲哭鬼，加幾個白眼，一個酒錢不給時的情形可不言而喻了。</p>
<p>在上海更容易和酒錢見面，自來水公司裏的出店祗要到人家水管子上去摸上一摸，就有開口索酒錢的可能，電燈匠接一接保險匣，最少又是二角錢酒錢，其他化錢於酒的地方多極，眞不勝枚舉呢。</p>
<p>有一次一位郵差到我家裏來要酒錢，我就拿一瓶高粱酒給他，呌他不必索錢去買，就現成的拿一瓶去，他自知我取笑他，並且郵差索酒錢是違反郵局定章的，因之無言而去，但後來我不免後悔，因爲我知道他背後一定有不雅的聲音在駡我了。</p>
<p>在做學生的時代，每一學期亦必須好幾塊錢酒錢，茶房和門房是不可不給的，如果在外邊走走，吃一次點心除小賬之外尙須另外的酒錢，雙料的化費，乘輪船，在寗波輪船上酒錢比票價還要大，這實在是很駭人的事，而社會的惡習亦可見一般了。</p>
<h3>蘇州將開魚菊會</h3>
<p>— 魚痴</p>
<p>蘇州地方，俗語呌做寫意場化，住在那裏的朋友，歡喜考究些養魚，種竹，藝蘭，栽菊，的勾當，更其是一所公衆娛樂之區，所以金魚同菊花栽殖得很多很多。年年到了秋高氣爽之時，必定徴集私家出品的金魚菊花，會合起來，開個魚菊展覽會來點綴這秋光，一方面可以引起游客的興趣，一方面還可以比賽各家的成績。開會的幾天，士女雲集，轟動全城，記得去年的魚菊會開的當兒，還吸引了不少上海文藝界中人來觀光，可見此會的價値了。今年公園管理主任范雲書君，因爲想增加游客的興趣起見，除徴得本地的私家名貴出品外，還邀到上海的「魚樂國金魚園」來參加盛會，魚樂國是一所大規模組織的金魚園，珍奇的名種，不可勝數，聽說此次運蘇參加的有不少外間不經見的名種在内，這倒也可使觀者增進些見識的　現在魚菊會的會期，已定本月十日起在蘇州五卅路公園舉行三天，倘上海有個人願意把出品去陳列，可以通訊給本埠法租界西蒲石路明星影片公司同吳吉人君接洽，那是展覽會中所最歡迎的。</p>
<h3>發迷數迷懶迷</h3>
<p>— 費文寳</p>
<p>年來時局不清，農村破産，社會經濟，亦呈崩潰之象。一般人民，感於人不敷出，咸存徼倖投機之心，日思發財者，謂之發迷：偏信術數者，謂之數迷；而夢想天降黄金，不勞而獲者，謂之懶迷。此三種人，合成發迷敵迷懶迷，以之譜成簡易樂調，爲四三五三二三，與此次航空奬劵所開頭彩號碼相同，不亦奇乎？（却酬）</p>
<h3>追記程硯秋之奇雙會</h3>
<p>— 奇生</p>
<p>程硯秋赴歐洲考家戲劇，爲時一年又半，八月間回國之後，重登氍毹，改良之點頗多。上星期應南京籌賑黄河水災會之聘來京表演義務戲二日於勵志社，票價分十元五元三元三等，每日滿座，足見其受社會歡迎之熱烈。予聽其第二晚之奇雙會，扮像之俊美如昔，嗓音之清越較二年前尤佳，表情細膩熨貼，絲絲入扣，妙在能設身處地，情與古合，可謂哀感頑艶，藝臻妙境矣，讀者試猜扮其夫趙冲者爲誰乎。蓋非姜妙香，而乃久不登台之紅豆館主也。館主已近耳順之年，因扮小生之故，剃去鬍鬚，頓成牛山之濯濯，及旣化裝，風度翩翩，猶似五陵年少，雍容華貴，自天生成，殆非人力所能學。至其一舉手，一動足，皆有法度凖繩，有水到渠成之妙。蓋渠得名小生王桂官之眞傳，功夫亦到爐火純青之候，絕無人間烟火氣矣。觀乎此，乃知舊劇藝術之妙，有不可思議者，觀至妙境，台下數千人，不論内外行，無不歡喜贊歎，於此可證之。聽其字音，亦異常考究，館主多才多藝，足爲票界生色，惜限於篇幅，而不克節節詳論之。是戲中有一趣事，硯秋持狀紙下塲時，以手摩館主之下頦，滿座爲之解頤，閨房之樂，有甚於畫眉者，此之謂歟？</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十八回　脈脈傳茶含悲慰夫婿忽　忽出塞强笑别家人</p>
<p>棲枝跟着進屋來放了一塊手絹在茶几上。江氏趁他不留神，將手絹揑了一揑，好像是經過水洗了一樣，於是乎更不敢作聲了。趙自强站在院子裏，也以爲他母女見面，必定有一番悲傷，所以站在外面候了一候。及至站了許久，却聽到並無聲息，料是無事，也就自向後院來了。趙翁背了兩手，正在走廊上來回的踱着緩步子呢，於是就向趙自强道：你回來的時候，已經不少了，還不該回營去嗎？趙自强直挺挺站着，向趙翁道：你老人家還有什麽話要對我說的嗎？趙翁說話的時候，原來還是背了兩隻手，繼續的走，這時才立定脚，突然一回頭向趙自强臉上，注視了一番，然後手摸摸鬍子，似乎有一口氣要歎了出來。但是在他一昻頭，眼珠一轉的時候，却又把話忍了回去了。趙自强看到父親不說，不能逼了父親說，於是低聲道：這一件事情，眞是不凑巧得很。不過當軍人的人，天天都有出發的可能的。所以在臨時得了司令，臨時就走，那是應有的事情。他口裏如此說着，眼睛望了父親，却不能向下繼續的說了，緩緩的埀了兩手，而且是緩緩的頓了眼睛皮。趙翁籠了兩隻衣袖，微偏了頭向兒子望着，許久的功夫，他忽然正了顔色道：你旣是到了回營的時候你就走罷，老躭誤着幹什麽：我……我……他說着頓了一頓道：我也没有什麽話說了。你走罷！他說時，却籠住了的兩隻手，也不肯抽開來，就這樣上下的移挪着，倒好像是和兒子作揖呢。可是他那雙老眼裏，正含着兩包眼淚，只在眼眶子上滾動，幾乎是要流了出來。（二三五）</p>
<p>短篇小說</p>
<h3>一個早晨（上）</h3>
<p>— 顧明道</p>
<p>「黑皮膚的健美的鄕下姑娘……一羣白鵝……棕色的古牛……捲起袖子背上腿上有栗子肉的農夫……火一般赤日下在踏水車的人……没有立體的建築丨丨大洋房……没有悠揚的粤曲……没有紅嘴唇長眉毛白粉臉兒的穿着高跟皮鞋的女子………」到他鄕下的舅舅家裏來避暑的平的腦海中縈繞着這一切：雖然他是坐在一個湖邊的一株老柳樹底下同他的表哥金福在釣魚，但是他的注意力已早不在釣竿上了。</p>
<p>「你在想什麽？」金福回過頭來這樣的問：</p>
<p>「没有什麽。」平笑了一笑，把手中的釣竿動了一動，表示着振作精神的樣子。「我覺得鄕下什麽都奇怪，城市裏看不到的東西，這裏都能看到。城市所看慣的，又是相反。」</p>
<p>「城裏好玩吧？你鄕下住不慣吧？」</p>
<p>「不見得，不過我覺得農人太苦了。」</p>
<p>「你怎樣知道呢？」</p>
<p>「哦，他們在這樣熱的天氣的太陽下做工，而他們得到的報酬太苦了。」</p>
<p>「報酬？」金福似乎不懂。</p>
<p>「就是他們應得的維持他們生活的東西，譬如吃喝衣住等等……。」平微笑地說着：</p>
<p>「他們祇是種田的農夫啊！」金福以爲他的表弟弄錯了。</p>
<p>一陣和風吹過來，激起了水紋，平以爲是有魚了，急把釣竿掣起，那裏知道祇是一條水藻。他很失望地說着：</p>
<p>「我們回去吃西瓜吧！」</p>
<p>在夏天吃素唸佛的平的舅母聽見他兒子金福說平怎樣地體恤農人，又說着：</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛，平兒眞是佛心。」</p>
<p>「少爺，報來了。」赤着脚的小婢拿着一張本「地報紙送進來。」</p>
<p>「此地報倒也不遲，他們用什麽方法送的？」</p>
<p>「每天走來的。」</p>
<p>「走來的。有多少路？」</p>
<p>「十多里吧！」金福說「你大槪也覺得他可憐了！」</p>
<p>「不，幷没有，我不過問問吧了。」</p>
<p>他舅舅是個地主，自然家裏一切的設備是都很漂亮的。金福喊婢女切了兩枚西瓜，自己開着雷電華（無線電話）。</p>
<p>平躺在沙發上看着報紙聽着雷電華播出的王人美的愛的花和聽了會流淚的提琴獨奏。</p>
<p>「雷電華……沙發……電扇……西瓜……冰箱……冷食物……」自然在地主家裏是都齊備的，平這般地想「野薔薇般的健美的黑皮膚姑娘……白鵝……古牛……穿着青布襯衫有栗子肉的男子……赤日下的工作人……」又來了，又錯雜地在他腦袋中反映着。他知道了電影裏做的祇是扮的，他好似瞭解了他們這一行人過着並没有電影明星們的生活。</p>
<p>衣裏有暴風雨。</p>
<p>早晨凉快了許多，平一早到湖邊去，一個兒去欣賞這鄕村的早晨。山的色，水的光，綠油油的田和摩天的老樹，牽着牛吃草的祗是單穿一條褲子的孩子們，這許多平在都市裏不常看見的。野孩子們不約面同的朝他身上瞧，連狗也狺狺地向他吠。</p>

<h3>古書中尋活字彙</h3>
<p>— 羅憮</p>
<p>古書中尋活字彙，是說得出，做不到的，他在那古書中，尋不出一個活字彙。</p>
<p>假如有「可看「文選」的青年」在這裏，就是高中學生的幾個罷，他翻開「文選」來，一心要尋活字彙，當然明知道有些字是已經死了的。然而他怎樣分别那些字的死活呢？大槪只能以自己的懂不懂爲標凖。但是，看了六臣注之後才懂的字不能算，因爲這原是死屍，由六臣背進他腦裏，這才算是活人的，在他腦裏即使復活了，在「未可看「文選」的青年」的眼前却還是死傢伙。所以他必須看白文。</p>
<p>誠然，不看注，也有懂得的，這就是活字彙。然而他怎會先就懂得的呢？這一定是曾經在别的書上看見過，或是到現在還在應用的字彙，所以他懂得。那麽，從一部「文選」裏，又尋到了什麽？</p>
<p>然而施先生說，要描寫宮殿之類的時候有用處。這很不錯，「文選」裏有許多賦是講到宮殿的，並且有什麽殿的專賦。倘有青年要做漢晋的歷史小說，描寫那時的宮殿，找「文選」是極應該的，還非看「四史」「晋書」之類不可。然而所取的僻宇也不過將死屍抬出來，說得神秘便名之曰「復活」。如果要描寫的是清故宮，那可和「文選」的瓜葛就極少了。</p>
<p>倘使連清故宮也不想描寫，而預備工夫却用得這麽廣泛，那實在是徒勞而仍不足。因爲還有「易經」和「儀禮」，裏面的字彙，在描寫周朝的卜課和婚喪大事時候是有用處的，也得作爲一文學修養之根基」，這纔更像「文學青年」的樣子。</p>
<h3>再談烟草與鴉片</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>予旣爲「烟草與鴉片」一文矣，茲有可以續述者。王夫之船山詩集七十自定藁有罌粟一詩云：</p>
<p>嬌小埀頭立，豐盈出面來。</p>
<p>花王休相妬，儂不向春開。</p>
<p>又雜詠四絕有句云：「罌粟苗輕翠瓣嬌。」用罌粟爲觀賞，「再見於王氏題詠。予意明代種此花者，不獨王氏一人，亦不止湖南一隅也。有明中葉，皇帝不數見羣臣。萬歷之時，神宗深居二十年，未嘗一接見大臣。倘爲鴉片成癮所誤，則罌粟宜負朱明亡國之責矣。不過當時宮廷所服者，疑皆出南洋諸國所貢之來路貨，而非中土所産也。</p>
<p>烟草成癮，亦始自明代。王肱枕蚓菴瑣語謂「烟葉出閩中，邊土人寒疾非此不治，關外至以一馬易一觔。崇禎中下令禁之，民間私種者仍多，利重法輕，民冐禁如故。尋下令，犯者皆斬。然不久因軍中病寒不治，遂弛其禁。予兒時尙不識烟爲何物，崇禎末，三尺童子莫不吃烟矣。」見陔餘叢考所引。吸食烟草，罪亦至斬。無怪後來禁吸鴉片，非威以死罪不可也。</p>
<h3>趕集</h3>
<p>— 盛煥明</p>
<p>在集上，人門尖起嗓子喊着，熙熙攘攘地鬧極了。可是很少有背了「札馬袋」，（註）或是挑了輕「籮擔」到集上來專門辦貨的。一隻雞，七八雙草鞋，或是十來個雞蛋，全是這種零零碎碎的小交易。一個年輕人把一挑「竹婁担」的穉猪挑到「白馬廟」的屋簷下憇了下來：抹抹額上的汗，　開大襟，用着「凉帽」扇凉，凝着神，玩味那種由辛勞和悶熱所給的疲乏。</p>
<p>「你肯出多少？丨十八個？鹽棧裏要賣二十四哪！得，蝕本賣給你，喂丨十八個回來吧…」那賣「私鹽」的直起喉嚨喊着一個倒提着隻母雞的中年人。提雞人只回了回頭，並未把脚住下來。</p>
<p>「喂，怎麽樣？依你十八個子兒還不興嗎？」</p>
<p>「……哦丨待我賣掉雞回頭來買」。</p>
<p>「……」賣私鹽的發了楞「操丨」他頽頽地放下稱。</p>
<p>集上的貨物，無形中似乎都特别便宜下來：草鞋每雙四銅子：蛋卅五個銅子十。在這大忙時節，每個人都打算早點將自已的貨便宜點售脫，採辦點必需的東西早點趕回家去。但還是不大有人要買，並不是眞的不要：大多的人都是要先賣掉貨，才能買貨的。</p>
<p>在從前，集日一到，那些賣跌打損傷膏藥，拆字，做「癩頭搶親」的木人戲，耍猴的在集上是到處可見到。而近年來幾乎是絕踪了。那末大的一個集市上只有一擔做木人戲的。「山東人」躱在帳圍裏嘴裏吹得吱吱地響，二個癩頭在木人戲台上骨骨骨地互相對碰着頭，不過這顯然已不能誘引那些肯出銅子的人了。</p>
<p>天忽然又罩上陰霾，濃霧似的微雨打灰蒼蒼的天穹上瀰散了下來，貨價跌落了：雞蛋每個三銅子，「白馬廟」屋簷下的穉猪每隻只賣二元五角。</p>
<p>「眞賤！這些小猪怕也養出了有個把月吧！」有人那末說，可是終没有人講買。</p>
<p>已有頗多的人改變交易方法：譬如，飯籃一隻換米三斤，米一斤換草鞋三雙……</p>
<p>「熟牛肉一塊錢五斤，客人帶點回去過過酒吧！」牛肉攤老板提起葷刀打了個呵欠。</p>
<p>做木人戲的「山東人」化了四個銅子，買了一大塊牛筋，頂着木人戲架，從那條給梅雨濘泥了的「官道」上哼着「三姑娘長得又俊又俏丨阿喲那雙小脚…」一步步地離開這集子。</p>
<p>黄昏爬了出來，這集子是老掉了。</p>
<p>（註）札馬袋丨是一種鄕下人用以擺錢及藏雜物的袋子。</p>
<h3>猶太人</h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>當我給生活書店的時事問題叢刊編著一本關於猶太人問題的小書的時候，首先在材料上遇到困難。這困難並不是由於材料的少，罩是日本的書報上，講得就很多了。但他們所講的，我覺得全不中用，因爲這些材料，都是以Ａnti－Ｓemitism爲骨子，故意揑造出來，用以侮蔑猶太人的謠言，幾乎是全不可靠的。這個，怪是也怪不得的。事事追蹤德意志的日本，對於希特拉的政策，當然不會有異議的，所以陸軍中將四天王延孝公然宣言：「爲保護日本帝國之國體與歷史，爲天壤無窮，寳祚萬歲起見，而對他們（猶太人）施行排擊。」因爲猶太人是一面「惡用了他們所創造的資本主義，破壞政治經擠的機構，」一面「持了社會主義，共産主義的劍，作破壞國家組織的運動」的「奸細。」</p>
<p>然而這類「奸細，」對於我們中華民國的「國體」「歷史」「天壤」「寳祚」有怎樣的危害，我還看不出，因此，我也没有對他們「施行排擊」的義務，而且時事問題叢刊的編者要我叙說的，　　　人　　　　相，而遺憾的是，　方　的材料實在太少了。</p>
<p>我的小書終於勉强編成了。因爲眞實的材料太少，内容當然是不很充實的。但是幸而還有幾種可靠的西洋書報，使我能夠把幾個重要的問題，槪括地說明；而最堪自慰的是，我對於猶太人，毫没有盃曲侮蔑之處。</p>
<p>但我最遺憾的是，在編著的當時，竟志掉一篇重要的文章，卽收在走向十字街頭中的廚川白　的「爲甚麽的侮蔑。」這篇文章，是爲猶太人辯護，而且極其辭嚴義正的。他於列舉猶太人在文化上的驚人的功績之外，對於世人最所賤視的猶太人的貪利一事，也給如下的辯明：</p>
<p>「猶太人的多數者，没有法子，只得依賴金錢勢力，作爲謀自身的安全的唯一的金城鐵壁了。因爲若不依仗這個，則連自己的生存權也要危險起來。在歐洲中世的某某時期，分明地有過猶太人的土地所有權被嚴禁這事，高尙的職業，在他們面前，也被封鎖了。其結果，他們只有依着貯蓄金錢，貪收利息，苟全性命，來主張自已的生存權，此外别無他途了。因此久而成性，遂至生出來很多的貪慾卑吝之徒，這也是値得同情的現象。把他們迫害到這步田地的基督敎徒，不是大可憎惡而大可歸咎的麽？」</p>
<p>廚川博士，並且早就預料到日本人也要排擊猶太人，他說：</p>
<p>「細想起來，到現今全然没有交涉的猶太人問題，連日本也注意起來的事，確是因爲日本成爲世界的日本罷。應當歡喜呀！甚麽樣掛念也用不着！在法國的魯爾占領，卽刻影響於日本的鐵和染料的市價的現今的時節，這件事寗是當然之事也說不定。以後在日本也要聽到極可怪的Ａnti-Ｓemitism的聲音罷。」</p>
<p>日本是這樣，中國又怎樣呢？猶太人問題是由來已久的問題，但我們從未加以注意，這且不說。就是自從希特拉豋台，對猶太人大施壓追，使這問題更形嚴重以來，我國人也還不是毫無　　麽。這沉　，是什麽理由。</p>
<p>勃羅以特說：「在日本和中國，因爲其土著的民族的布爾　，没有猶太人來與他們發生陪級利害的衝突，所以没有　猶太主義。」就把這作爲中國人不對猶太人下井投石的理由罷丨雖然日本已因法西主義的盛行而有了反猶太運動。丨然而，回情猶太人的人，爲什麽也没有一個呢？</p>
<p>也許，這是中國人太有自知之明的緣故，因爲知道自己的運命，正和猶太人相同，而且連猶太人都不如，倘若貿然對猶太人表示起同情來，恐反爲所笑，因而沉默的罷？</p>
<p>實際上，中國人比起猶太人來，確也相差太遠。猶太人於失去國土的二千多年後，尙能保持他們的國語，在文化上，對人類貢獻莫大的偉業；且在現代的資本主義與社會主義的活動中，都占極大的勢力；而復國運動的進行，也百折不撓。</p>
<p>然而，猶太人的復國運動，問題到底也還多着。房龍敎授在「我們的世界」一書中，有這樣一段話：</p>
<p>「倘如猶太人自己對於他們的舊國土知道該怎麽樣辦，那末事情就要簡單得多，如今歐洲東部丨特别是在俄羅斯的丨一般正統派的猶太人，都主張維持它的現狀，就是把它當做一個巨大的神學院，並且附設一個收藏希伯萊古物的小小博物館罷了。至於比較年老的一輩，則都記得當初預言家說的「死者應該葬埋死者」那句名言，又感覺到對於往日光榮的痛哭足以妨礙來日的光榮，所以都希望把巴力斯坦造成如瑞士或丹麥那樣一個正當的近代國，從此大家忘記旣往的一切，不要再和阿拉伯人去爭幾塊無謂的石頭，却去專心從事於築路開河的工作。」</p>
<p>這話，獻給猶太人固好，獻給中國青年尤其有用然而，倘若稍加以曲解，則危險也十分大了。</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（二十三）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑李維克著譯</p>
<p>羅蘭老爹聳了聳肩說：</p>
<p>「啊，啊，最賢明的人的生活是把它過得舒服。我們並不是牛馬，而是人。如果我們生而貧苦，那便應當工作！有什麽辦法呢，那祗好工作。但我們旣有財産的利息收入，哈哈，那便要蠢透了頂的人才會去勞苦了。」</p>
<p>筆爾傲然回說：</p>
<p>「我們兩人的趨向不同！我呢，對於世界上的一切，祇尊重學問與理智，其餘都不屑道。」</p>
<p>羅蘭太太總是盡力緩和父子間的不斷的衝突；她因此轉過話題，談着上星期在波爾柏克洛安托地方發生的一宗殺人案。大家卽刻留心聽着案情，對於那種有趣的可怕的情狀，動人的罪惡的秘密等，感着津津的味。這種罪惡卽使庸俗，可恥，可憎，但仍能給人類的好奇心以一種奇異且普遍的誘惑。</p>
<p>可是羅蘭老爹還時時取出錶來看道：</p>
<p>「快點，我們要動身走了。」</p>
<p>筆爾笑說道：</p>
<p>「一點鐘還没到呢。眞的，這實在用不着害我吃一塊冷豬排啊。」</p>
<p>「你也同到公證人那邊去嗎？」他母親問他。</p>
<p>他乾脆地回答：</p>
<p>「我嗎，不，去做什麽呢？這事是毫用不着我去的。」</p>
<p>哲安一聲不響，好像完全和他無關似的。當他們談着波爾柏克的殺人案時，他曾以法學者的態度，發表了一點意見，並閘述了幾句對於罪惡與罪人的觀察。現在，他又一句話不說了，可是他那眼睛裏的光彩，兩頰上那種生氣勃勃的紅色，紅到發光的鬍鬚，彷彿在宣佈他的幸福。</p>
<p>一家人走了以後，又只剩着自己一人的筆爾，再繼續着上午找房子的工作。在樓梯上一上一下跑了兩三點鐘之後，他終於在佛郎沙一世大街尋着了一所美麗的房子：這是一所高大的Ｅntreso（介在地下與第一層樓之間的房子），有兩張門通往兩條不同的街道，有兩個客廳，有一個玻璃過道，病人可以一面在那裏等候診視，一面在陳設的花旁走來走去，另外還有一間可以望得見海的圓形的精緻的飯廳。</p>

<h3>洋拆提高收解仍平</h3>
<p>昨日銀行仍然封關半天、故交易及收解形勢依然平淡、市場中票拆早午市同爲九分、較前日改好二分、劃頭仍白劃無加水、拆票交易早市收解四百七十餘萬、新交易五十餘萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易四十餘萬、洋押欵交易一百三十餘萬、鈔票進出一百四五十萬、銀行收解、外商銀行收解票欵銀一百五十餘萬、洋一百九十餘萬、各種貨滙押什諸欵收解銀二百七十餘萬、洋三百九十餘萬、特欵收解銀二百四十餘萬、出倉銀四十萬、洋五十萬、華商銀行收解票欵三百十餘萬、各種貨滙稅什諸欵收解四百八十餘萬、特欵收解三百十餘萬、進倉四十萬、日商銀行進倉銀三十萬、出倉洋二十萬、錢莊洋公單收解四千九百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解、五百八十餘萬、各路匯欵六十餘萬、客路來去胃二十二萬、</p>

<h3>證劵　公債前市比較熱鬧</h3>
<p>昨華商證券交易所、市面雖不若前日之呆滯、但亦祇上半日較有上落、蓋以傳聞發行新鹽稅庫券一萬二千萬、舊事重提、此種傳說、雖去事實尙遠、而人心不足爲之撼動、多頭稍有出籠、市價卽行見小、因多空雙方均有亟求了結者、故市價回小、卽有抵補、尙不致引起鉅大波瀾、昨上午開盤、四號買進編遣裁兵價尙略高一角半、入後零星賣出頗湧、行市逐步趨疲、多者遽小半元、遠期正六特小八角之多、但爲畸形、非正式趨勢、次盤前列各種、繼續趨疲、統鹽稅平穩、正六乃回高半元餘、午後開盤、似較壁一二角、因交易清閑、無關元入、收盤交易更清、市價亦混沌、盤旋而已、按趨勢如此或將先小後大、但其實力如何、究尙不易捉摸、全日市價結果、計跌落二三角居多、惟一九開遠期跌五角、金短金長尙好二三角、成交總數、計共六百零六萬七千元、内現貨二千元、期貨統鹽稅共二百五十四萬元、裁兵佔六十七萬五千、一九　善共六十五萬五千、廿　廿　共一百零六萬五千、餘則數萬至十餘萬不等、</p>
<h3>紗花　印棉定價又廉　標花跌勢漸見有力化</h3>
<p>棉市頗虛、跌風益勁、日現不穩之象、以印棉步落、而匯兌步長、以致採算價愈趨愈廉、日商辦意停滯、故多頭逐步了結、市面由此鬆懈、但有一部份多頭意　尙昂、而世界大勢則異常衰弱、美棉估計大約增一百餘萬包、前途仍難穩定</p>
<h3>鄭標多頭回出</h3>
<p>鄭標前市開盤、美棉雖停市、印棉續跌二羅比七五、塲中賣氣又熾、各月跌一角半至二角、午後聞印棉定價又廉、致人心尤慌、各月跌一角半至二角半、全日成交統計八萬六千三百擔、查賣出瑞大八千九百擔、崇安六千九百擔、椿記六千四百擔、永大一千六百擔同孚二千四百擔、遠大一千六百擔、新亨一千五百擔、買進元德四千六百擔、仁豐三千六百擔、同興四千五百擔、大孚一千八百擔、穗隆一千六百擔、裕康一千八百擔、收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>廠需全部停頓</h3>
<p>現棉生意完全停頓矣、以印棉在市兜售頗廉、廠方以紗銷不振、皆不敢貿然接受、來源新姚花三千五百十包、通花一千二百包、</p>
<h3>現紗銷路仍清　標紗今日决定開拍　另繳證金二十二元</h3>
<p>人標期紗繼續停市、午後四時經紀人公會及理事室皆有召集重大會議、但結果内容均秘而不宣、現紗銷路較爲清澹、以世界棉業情形日趨衰敗、故人心不振、前途狀况、殊乏把握耳、記者發稿時、得最後消息、謂有和緩辦法明日（九日）决定開拍、惟多空兩方、每百包須繳持證金二十二元、至現紗客帮買去、統計僅三百三十三包、行情平疲、茲將各帮買額列下、</p>

<h3>糧食　粉市近期再漲</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、繼續上展、近期尤爲挺俏、因各廠多日未有續定洋麥、故不復再有鉅量標準套出、而北洋南洋東北各實銷去化、續有問津實銷辦裝現貨外、因本月份可以直抽現粉、故對於本月份標凖進取甚力、浮空爭捕、散多吸收、廠方亦將本月籌碼收回、故開價卽漲、午後一度被多頭出檔而小、然結果又被客廠收補而又漲、最後收市本月大二分下月大一分半、一二月各大七五、三月大二五、四月反小二五、因有廠出、</p>
<h3>洋麥未到前　標準麥暫看好面</h3>
<p>昨日麥市、開市後行販不出、廠有問津之意、多頭心堅續收、欄杆帮空戶盡補、雖有一部份浮空售出、而市面迄居挺俏、市上人心、一致看好、大約在洋麥現貨未到與新交易未成交之前、市面可以站住、收市價本月一月三月各大一分、下月二月四月各大三分、現麥開鎭江麥二千五百包、價三元七角二分、爲信大辦去、</p>
<h3>河下米市大局無進展</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源四十餘號、貨五千四五百包、本街店胃較前轉佳、爲貨共約四千餘石、是以疲頺市况、猶呈起色、然究以人心未堅、大局平定而已、包胃昨雖有南北洋兩帮動辦、但閩帮僅辦晚稻一百餘包、烟臺等帮亦祇七八百包、銷路反覺稍遜、故青角泗楓等晚稻行情步修近角、至常　蘇同等粳及南港等花色厚稻、市價俱無榮辱、杜尖店胃頗合、亦見站定、羊尖銷化滯澀、續疲角許、陰元豐元均呈　勢耳、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船、計有三十七八號、銷路早晨清淡、午市轉後、做開大盤、新粳·羊·杜·埠·秈價小角許、陰白元、亦跌一二角、早·薄·稻及客秈平定、無上落云、</p>
<h3>湖南糙油新米頭批到申　▲市存洋米二十二萬四千八百八十五包</h3>
<p>昨洋客秈市况、因客帮停辦、形勢仍在看軟中、但貨主已不似日前之肯賤脫矣、故市居平站之局、本街以市價便宜、續有問津、寗波帮亦有越小辦裝之意、故市面午後帶穩、全市開湖南陳機油一百包、價七元一角、無錫羊尖二百包、價七元七角半、又回籠小絞四百包、價七元零五分、盡爲本街辦去、寗波去南说廠秈一百包、價六元三角半、</p>
<p>昨開之湘陳機油米、係新近裝到、同時又到糙油新米二百零六包、則未曾售開、油米爲浙帮歡迎、北方向亦辦裝、此後或有繼續到貨、</p>
<p>洋米徴稅事、傳已决定徴收每百斤二·五金單位、照目下市價合到百分之九十、倘爲實行則進口米立卽阻止矣、目下全市存米、除日商回籠小絞存大興棧二萬四千九百多包外、原有存底、共計二十二萬四千八百八十五包、計存於義泰興棧一二○、○六○包、隆茂棧七八、八五二包、其昌棧一七、一○○包、元一棧八、三四七包、招商華棧五二六包、總計二二四、八八五包、</p>
<h3>黄荳高貨獨漲四五分</h3>
<p>黄荳來源確擁擠、惟高貨缺乏、中擋貨萎疲日甚、昨各帮趁賤、成交車輪貨十四五車、故高貨獨漲四五分、中下貨一時難以向榮、九江荳尙少看好、杜荳仍無現貨、沙黄平平、近日青荳有甬帮問津、市局尙穩云、</p>
<h3>南北貨　金針菜再漲一元</h3>
<p>金針菜連日銷胃甚暢、而到貨並未見增、故行客方面、進意均濃、號盤報緊轉俏、昨市開價又趨緊漲、頂莊菜開至十九元、比前突升一元、以次中下擋漲度亦相彷彿、如果走場不淡、後市尙有漲望、</p>
<h3>絲茶　海外絲價跌風未戢</h3>
<p>▲里昂華絲又告猛跌　里昂生絲市塲自法滙發生變動後、華絲價卽難立住、初Ｂ級白廠經每基羅由八十法郎跌至七十八法郎七五、昨晨法莊信孚等接得里昂電告、里昂白廠經價又告猛跌、Ａ級每基羅祇開八十三法郎七五、計跌兩法郎半、Ｂ級開七十三法郎七五、計跌五法郎、</p>
<p>▲錫長吐運到三十件　無錫絲廠近因歐美絲銷一落千丈、紛紛减工停機、絲廠長吐運滬日减、昨晨由滬錫客車裝到三十件、</p>
<p>▲人造絲銷仍無起色　邇來外滙放長、人造絲價轉疲、客銷仍無起色、昨祇本埠綢廠進紅藍金鐘牌現期貨十六箱、價自一百七十二元二角半至一百六十元七角半凈盤、</p>
<p>▲洋莊絲銷難望轉機　海外絲織廠邇來生絲需要不起、存絲充厚、國戶競出、絲價逐步下降、電轉價益小、歐美各莊均觀望不前、華絲商虧本益巨、態度消極、絲銷難望轉機、昨祗成交灰經十包、搖經五包、價仍平疲、</p>
<h3>摩洛哥茶市疲滯</h3>
<p>據最近行家接到消息稱、邇來摩洛哥綠茶市面、忽趨疲滯、日本綠茶銷路、幾於完全停頓、中國路莊平水珍眉珠茶、亦較前大爲衰減、就珍眉一項言之、平時每月可銷五六千箱、現下祗銷四千箱、加之各洋行、現下裝到大批新貨、市面益見擁擠、是以各茶售價、除高莊貨尙能站定外、其餘均跌十餘法郎至二十法郎不等、</p>
<h3>疋頭　馬褲呢旺銷價漲</h3>
<p>市上流行之一零零五馬褲呢、邇來趨勢突飛猛進、蓋前日自德記洋行三十六箱現貨開出後、標準公盤立卽上漲、因該呢來源已絕、而銷場正値旺令、昨日批發盤價一律售八元二角半、門市裁縫零剪、尙須酌加、其十八兩二十四號之顔色、市銷行暢、因之賣方均以居奇、批售俱須八元半凈盤、大多還須打票現交、聞德記行開出三十六箱之價、每碼祗七元六角云、</p>
<p>生意經（四十七）</p>
<h3>花生與生仁之營業（續）</h3>
<p>— 愕</p>
<p>花生與生仁多自北方運來，營業似當操諸北貨業，但上海之花生與生仁營業，其業務較大者，仍屬於雜糧業，有時完全爲雜糧業獨攬，北貨業反向其批發也。北貨與雜糧兩業經營之外、尙有兼帶水菓之地貨業，亦有此花生與生仁賣買批發。因花生産於沙土中，當然爲地貨之一種，又以其栽種形狀等均輿各種食糧相同，且屬於豆科植物，宜乎爲米麥雜糧陸陳行業所經營。復因其爲北貨，又似乾果。遂爲北貨業經營。因此乃爲雜糧北貨地貨三業各自經營。向來官廳頒發之牙行官帖，乃亦同有此物，此祇據上海而言。若上海以外則並不相同，例如内地各縣之米糧行、迄未見有花生與生仁出售也。至此産地，則頗有爲糧行經營之。</p>
<p>雜糧業與北貨業之生仁來源相同，卽係由火車輪船及沙船裝自北方魯豫直三省。去路則不盡同，除洋莊出口北貨與糧業均有交易外，南貨拆貨茶食各店均爲北貨業獨攬，其交易數量細而緊，卽一包二包八包十包，無不批售。糧業則不然，去路盡屬整票，八十或一百包之交易已稀，大都以車計，或以來貨提單整張計，（在新貨初見市時每票數目亦微）去路則爲洋莊，油廠，粤閩及其他客帮，以及本街内地。（卽轉批於北貨業也）。産地製成熟貨之生油乃盡屬於米業糧業。客埠有糧業之駐在採辦員，到申客人又均兼營油豆餅雜糧，在車輪未發達時，乃爲沙船（帆船）興盛時代，沙船帮均加入油豆餅業，在歷史上已有深切關係，故糧業到貨，自昔迄今，均見旺暢。至於地貨業之到銷，均與上述兩業有出入。地貨業到貨以花生爲主，産區祇有崇明一帶及浦東各地，並無北方來源，銷路亦祗拆貨及零戶而已。（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>一位理想中的敎師</h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>一位敎師，他身上負着敎育的重任，時時和學生接觸，直接間接給與學生的影響，異常深切；故一位敎師的優劣，關係於國家的敎育，甚然重大。但敎師的好壞，有什麽標凖？我們應怎樣去選擇？這雖不容易解答，我現在不妨將一位理想中的敎師應具備的資格，寫在下面，提出來和大家討論討論。</p>
<p>一，豐富的學識　讀書最大的目的，是要求　；故一位良好的敎師，自身應是個博學多才之士然後才得將其豐富的學識，傳授於受業的學子，以滿足其知識慾。自然的，敎師並不是萬能的，不會什麽都懂；但至少對於自己所担任的學科，應有充分的研究，方能勝職；若得樣樣皆通，那是再好没有了。</p>
<p>二，良好的敎法　一位敎師，單憑豐富的學識，還未足以盡敎育之事。在學問之外，又貴有良好的敎法。因爲有了良好的敎法，凡所講解，才能使學生明白曉悟，才能將自己所得的收獲，分散給學生。但這並不是單指那種注入式的敎法而言。蓋一個敎師，徒知一味將些知識傾注於學生的腦裏，也是無益的：必須時時留意到他們能否容納，能否融化。最要的，還要使學生的本能，有充分自由發展的機會，敎師一方固然應解答學生的一切疑難，使他們理會；一方又要呌學生自己去下思考的工夫，以發展其固有的天性。此外，又須處處用適當　方法，引起學生求學的興趣；時時令學生自己隨便出來發揮意見　能這樣，敎學始可以收事半功倍之效。</p>
<p>三，雄辯的口才，我們常見有好些積學的敎師，因爲口才呆笨，辭不盡意，往往不能暢所欲言，致學生凡事未能明瞭，一無所得；反之，有些善於雄辯的，雖才學平淡，但他們一上課堂，則口若懸河，滔滔不絕，講得非常起勁，卒令聽者動容，皆能理會。是以一位優良的敎師，流利的口舌，也是不可缺少的。</p>
<p>四，新穎的思想　思想也是很重要的。時代是前進的，舊思想當然不適於今日；就是新思想，也常千變萬化。故一位理想中的敎師，又必需要有切合時代的思想。蓋敎師對於學生，不惟要增長其見聞，且須訓練其思想。若敎師的腦際，滿藏着一些腐臭的舊思想，則所養成出來的學生，其思想亦必不能適應時代的潮流，終至變爲時代的落伍者。所以我們以爲良好的敎師，應是個思想清新的敎育者。</p>
<p>五，完善的人格　在敎育上，我覺到人格的感化，比知識的灌輸，其功用來得强大。因爲人是一種感情動物，惟有利用感情最足以誘導之。一位賦有完善人格的敎師，他的一舉一動，無形中已成爲學生的模範；他的一言一語，都可以使學生感動。這樣潛移默化，學生的品性，自然而然也會陶冶得日趨完善。</p>
<p>一位理想中的敎師，至少應具備上述五種條件，才配稱爲優良的敎育者，才配負敎育的職責。眞的，也許這些條件太嚴酷了吧，這點我也想到；可是敎育這任務，是十分重大的，這又豈能容我們苟且從事的嗎？</p>
<h3>回憶已過的夏天</h3>
<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>春姑娘是那樣姍姍地來，怱怱地去，她没有賜與我們神秘的一笑；而夏先生的淫威却已降臨到我們身旁。</p>
<p>馬路上的柏油，被車輪壓成圖案的花紋，黄包車夫的脚跟，也像打在潮潤的泥土上一般，一股熱氣化成汗滴從額角上個下來。坐車的人覺得迎面吹來一陣好風，解開領上的鈕扣，或西裝的領帶，享受這天的幸福；他們架起腿來，喊着「快！快！」</p>
<p>紅　人的頭上，老纒着巾。他吊在半空中，知道嗎？太陽離你更近了，這是反抗的時候！</p>
<p>汽車箭也似的射過，車上的摩登老爺太太，赴電影院的招請，肉感的電影，冷氣管，冰結漣，正等候他們的光顧。而汽車夫也比黄包車幸福的多，他雖没有後者的享樂，但是風迎面吹來的時候，他也解開衣領上的鈕扣。</p>
<p>洋房，接着天。畫倦人盡，小姐腂着脚踝，披着綢製浴衣　從洗澡間踏進臥房。電扇吹着浴衣的下擺，她燃了一枝烟，躺上皮沙發，隨意的翻幾頁愛情小說之類，或本埠增刊的電影廣告，濛朧的睡去。</p>
<p>晚上，年虹燈代替了白晝。人，汽車，汽車，人，徐家匯，曹有渡……</p>
<p>遊戯場擠滿了觀衆，炭酸氣蒸着，鑼鼓喧鬧。賣淫婦的肉體，裹在狹小的旗衫内，打情，駡俏。敞開硬領綢衫的小流氓，滿意地笑着，鈔票與肉體的交換。</p>
<p>月光從樹蔭中射到地上，像打破的鏡子。一雙並行的情侶，女的蓬亂的頭靠在男的肩窩上，他們踏着瑣散的月影，慢步，低語。公園中的情况，盡充滿了羅曼蒂克的氣氛。這裏没有夏丨丨是夜。</p>
<p>一　上海典型的少爺，衝進跳舞塲，按摩院，…從變態的生活中享受變態的性的刺激。</p>
<p>亭子間裏的洋行小職員王先生，他燃着白禮氏的燭頭，狗吃尿的捫向他進攻的南京蟲。擱樓上的襪廠女士，也張大了眼，聽那寗波二房東，和了三百和的笑聲。</p>
<p>街頭，巷尾。頂括括十鈿的呌喊。小孩子，苦力，製造時疫的提倡者。倒棄了的垃圾堆上，蒼蠅成羣的飛着。板門上躺着一個赤膊的男子，哼着伸手摸姐的歌聲，兩個穿得很整齊的湖絲阿姐格格笑着走過。</p>
<p>鄕下的小孩子，睡夢中聽見汽車的喇叭聲，他向母親爸買了汽車？」</p>
<p>窮人的命在車輪下滾過，富人的命跌進了池塘。</p>
<h3>深秋農村生活的一幕</h3>
<p>— 乾序</p>
<p>我們不是常時吃黄雀麽？那東西又肥壯又鮮美，下酒是最好没有的了。如果說蟹是水中的異味，那麽陸上便没有再比黄雀更好的；所以黄雀與蟹，可以稱是深秋食品中的「二絕」。</p>
<p>秋深了，田裏的榖都長得非常豐滿，粒粒的白米在薄薄的壳中包着，又嫩又實，於是黄雀便活躍起來了，成羣結隊地，飛到稻田中來啄食，往往很好的一畝稻，榖長得滿滿的，却冷不防給牠們啄得七零八落。農人恨透了，但是没有什麽辦法，祗有到那個時候，時時跑得去察看。</p>
<p>然而也有許多農人在這時候依靠捕黄雀爲一筆收入的，他們捕捉的方法巧妙極了，他們知道黄雀的窠巢大都在蘆塘的灘邊，所以每到蒼茫的暮靄，倒影在水面的時候；他們便走到堤岸邊去察看雀羣集宿的所在了。察看已畢，他們便回去着手凖備，捕捉的工具很簡單，一個長柄的絲網斗，一盞小玻璃燈就行了。</p>
<p>一會兒天黑了，他們都打扮起來，所謂「打扮」，並不是像上海的「摩登姑娘」出去時的塗脂抹粉，也不是像紳士般的整衣理服：他們不過爲工作便利起見，赤了一雙脚，腰裏束一根腰帶，而將胸前的鈕子暢開着。</p>
<p>他們如臨大敵，如偷營刦寨，銜枚疾走，各不相語，走到蘆灘邊了，就向着日裏看好的地方走去，這時，他們靜得連長氣都不敢透，脚步輕輕的放下去，再輕輕的提起來，一步步的到達目的地了，他們絡續的走下水去。蘆塘裏的水差不多有一尺深，踏下去浸到膝灣，但是他們不顧這些，全神貫注着，一網斗一網斗的向雀叢的歇宿所在網上去，但是一網不論三個或五個，他們必須隨手扼死，丢入解開衣鈕的胸懷裏。假使扼得没有死，一有了呼鳴的聲音，那麽，其他的黄雀都要飛跑了，不但自己一無所得，還要連累全伴白手而返呢。</p>
<p>所以在狂風呼號的深夜，更是他們一試好身手的機會了。</p>
<p>現在他們也比較以前聰明得多了，没有狂風的深夜，他們會令他們的妻子兒女，拿鑼或火油箱在蘆葦外面敲起來，以擾亂牠們的聽覺　他們一面敲着，一面工作，這樣可以得到很多的成績。</p>
<p>然而吃的人們啊，在持雀飲酒高談闊論的時候，也曾想到黑夜涉水通宵不寐的農夫們没有？</p>

<h3>命運</h3>
<p>— 健</p>
<p>命運支配了我們中國，不知幾千百年；過去的慘死在命運的鐵腕中和現在的輾轉呻吟在命運的鐵蹄下，更不知幾千萬人。人們受了它的愚弄，蒙了它的麻醉，自然會心悅誠服地聽它蹂躪，任它幸割。雖然也有過少數人，起而反對，斥爲迷信，然而並没多大效力。</p>
<p>經過了辛亥革命，五四運動，國民革命，幾次政治的文化的震動，命運也曾隨着動搖過，倒霉過；可是僅僅「曇花一現」，不久「死灰復燃」格外來的厲害。</p>
<p>現在革命過了，命運正像雨後春筍一般滋生起來。到處算命先生的生意興隆，自然是意料中事。從「中國人是命苦的」一句話發表以來，命運乘機蠢動，聲勢愈盛。近來在各人的談話中，文章裏，通信内都有大談命運之槪。命運已籠罩着全中國，命運已佔據了全中國人的心窩。大哉命運！</p>
<p>同是一樣人；有的富貴利達，有的潦倒終身；有的身兼要職，有的流離失所。至於烽火連天，水旱遍地的災區災民，餐風飲露，鳩形鵠面；大都會中的資産階級，酒綠燈紅，酣歌狂舞，過着極度享樂的生活。這種對立的矛盾的現象，一般淺俗的見解，都委諸命運，也惟有命運最容易來糊糊塗塗解决這個問題。</p>
<p>然而，這不是眞理，祗是錯誤。命運和人們的行動絕無關係，當然不能生出因果作用來；至多人們先信了命運的謬說，轉變方向，改易態度，成了倒果爲因罷了。如果一切統由命運來規定，那末，人們變了殭屍，動彈不得，聽其自然好了。什麽「努力」「奮鬥」，什麽「抗日」「反帝」，等於廢話，還像什樣樣子？</p>
<p>命運原是産生在不平等的社會制度中的。人們遭遇了種種困難，旣無勇氣去解除，又非私心所情願，說是命運，無可奈何；就此低首下心，心平氣和下來，什麽都算了。這是人類惰性的表現，逃避現實的好方法。</p>
<p>不是命運註定了人生，倒是人們製造了命運。這裏可以找到一個結論：命運以及定命論的學說也和「神權」一樣，是畸形的，病態的社會中所獨有，是減少抵抗力，消滅進取性的東西。</p>

<h3>除暴安良</h3>
<p>— 萬成</p>
<p>場</p>
<p>一　　村的全景，沐浴在初啓的陽光中，兀是清新而寗靜：村裏一個人家的　門開了，門内走出一個農夫，年紀約莫四十多歲的光景，他右手持著一柄菜刀，左手提著一隻母鷄，預備到門外來宰殺。農婦丨年與農夫相仿丨抱著一個嬰孩，立在靠近門扉的院落内，安閒地瞧著農夫。</p>
<p>農夫　（出門向空中一望，露出笑容，接著向門内的農婦說：）四六媽，你看，今天天氣多麽晴朗，這孩子眞有點好運道呢！</p>
<p>農婦　是啊，天老爺知道四六兒今天週月，所以賞賜我們一個晴天，好讓我們熱鬧熱鬧。（說著俯首向　中的嬰孩　：　　　　　，連菩薩都幫忙　（要孩　出　　的聲音，農婦禁不住在他臉上狂吻。）</p>
<p>農夫　（含笑著宰鷄，一壁自言自語；）這隻鷄子直肥得有趣；若不是早點去買，還不被人揀了去嗎？不是别的，鷄不肥，烺出湯來没有味。巴巴是千載難逢，不能敎客人吃得不高興！（說罷鷄已宰好，夫婦一同進内；一會兒，農夫又提竹籃出，臨行向門裏招呼）四六媽，你趕快把鷄子升火煨起來，火工不到湯是不會濃的。你還得把屋裏收拾收拾，等一息客人來時，免得手忙脚亂地弄不乾凈。我現在到鎭上去買點蔬菜，馬上就回來了。（屋裏諾諾連聲農夫健步而去。稍停，農婦挾著米箕出來，隨手將門反掩，原來她到溪邊淘米去了。）</p>
<p>遠遠跑來一個年少的鄕長，隨帶一個侍役，行至農夫的門前，侍役便道：</p>
<p>侍役　少老爺，我剛纔看見他家殺鷄的，你想他家還配吃鷄子嗎？（注視門口，見了地上的鷄血：）不信請看，這地上不是血嗎？一定無疑是他偷了我們公館裏的鷄了！</p>
<p>鄕長（深信不疑，於是大怒：）該死該死，胆子眞不小，居然偷起我的鷄子來了！他難道敢在老虎頭上撲蒼蠅嗎？好，他旣找到我，就不能怪我手條子辣了！（說罷氣冲冲地衝開籬門，一面吩咐僕人先行回去。）</p>
<p>第二場</p>
<p>三間草屋，收拾得倒還齊整：中間是堂屋，左首是廚房，右面是臥室。鄕長四處搜查，只見廚下正煨著雞子，不禁怒氣十倍，但是屋裏無人，他也等不及再守農夫回來理論，一逕奔到右面臥室裏，抱起躺在搖籃裏的嬰孩，用力向地上一擲；只聽一聲慘呌，他便飛身出門走了。剛纔出門，侍役忽又趕來，連忙對他說：</p>
<p>侍役　回少老爺，公館裏的雞子已經尋著了，不知是誰將牠罩在一隻笆斗裏的；少老爺，旣不是他家偷的，就饒恕了他吧！</p>
<p>鄕長　（似有悔意，默然無語。）……</p>
<p>第三塲</p>
<p>一條鄕村的大道，不絕地有許多行人來往；有的剛上鎭去，有的正從鎭上回來。忽然奔來了男女兩個瘋人，就是農夫農婦；他倆哭著訴著，形狀極其可憐。</p>
<p>夫婦　我的心肝！我的小肉！我的苦命的孩子啊！……</p>
<p>行人見狀，驚恐失常，兀自東逃西散，深恐被瘋人拖住了。</p>
<p>一會兒，鄕長帶來幾個强悍的莊丁，傳令將兩個瘋人綑綁，連拉帶扯地立刻驅逐出境了。</p>
<p>鄕長　（向村民演說：）我旣爲本鄕的鄕長，就負「除暴安良」的責任；所以現在將他倆趕走，免得大家不能安居。</p>
<p>村民　（拍手高呼：）啊，我們大家都要擁護爲我們謀　幸福的鄕長！我們大家還應該贈送鄕長一方除暴安良的匾額！</p>
<p>衆人　好，大家一齊贊成；幷祝我們的鄕長萬歲！</p>
<p>鄕長在這一片歡呼中，含著笑容歸去了。　丨完丨</p>

<h3>好萊塢保護小演員的方法　加利福尼亞法律的森嚴　足供律師一年研究之用</h3>
<p>— 茂德</p>
<p>前天寫了一篇「好萊塢最可愛的一個小孩子」之後，自己覺得很有趣，而想再補充一下。這篇「好萊塢保護小演員的方法」，就是繼續上文而來的。好萊塢的電影職業中央介紹所，永遠是有幾千個小孩子的名字存記着，等待各公司的選用的。裏面什麽國籍的人都有，中國，日本，印度，斐洲黑人，墨西哥人，暹邏或婆羅洲的人全有。他們各有各的用處，等到要用着的時，黑人的小孩子，價値亦不比白人的低，或者因爲稀少的緣故，價錢還要貴些。</p>
<p>這些小演員旣在攝影塲裏，佔了很重要的地位，於是地方當局，就不能不想方法，去保障他們的健康安全。加利福尼亞州的法律，對於保障這種小演員的，實在嚴厲得很。我們現在可以略爲叙述一點，盼望我們的各電影公司，能不等法律來裁判，就自動的採用任何可能的保護小演員的各種方法，爲這般可愛的小演員造幸福。</p>
<p>據加利福尼亞的法律，小演員在六個月以下的，祗准每天停留在公司裏兩個鐘頭，而在攝影塲裏工作，每天不得超過二十分鐘，並且每次上鏡頭，不能超過三十秒鐘。小演員年齡在六個月以上，二足年以下者，每天祇准停留在公司裏四個鐘頭，其中工作不得超過兩個鐘頭。小演員自兩歲以上到六歲的，每天可以停留在公司裏六小時，但工作不得超過三小時，童年演員自六歲以上至十八歲的，每天可以停留公司裏八小時，而每天工作亦不得超過四小時。小演員應當得的薪水，亦係由地方當局規定的。小演員生下後不滿一個月的，每天的薪水，係美金七十五元；一個月以上，三個月以下的，係每天五十元；自三個月至六個月的，每天二十五元。</p>
<p>以上的不過是些簡略的幾種大綱，其實好萊塢保護小演員的法律，繁重得非凡。許多禁例，足供法律家當作一種專門功課研究之用。例如因爲要保護小演員的目力，就禁止用强烈的燈光射在他們的臉上。攝影塲上必定有看護。此外還有什麽婦女會咧，慈幼會咧，他們的代表每天來監視着。小演員的哺乳或食物，都有一定的時間規定。公司裏僱用一個小演員，先須經過敎育機關騐過體格。以後若繼續工作，則三個月必須重騐一次。公司裏的幼兒室如何佈置等等，亦都有法律詳細規定的。小演員的工作時間，亦不能在下午十時以後。其餘的，因限於篇幅，亦不能細述了。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「媳婦淚」　ＡnotherＬanguaqe　丨米高梅出品　國泰開映丨</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>自「白姊妹」開映之後，漢倫海絲給與了我們最深刻的印象。不管她是否就是當代第一悲劇明星，然而她在「戰地情天」等悲劇中確是極有成績的。我們在「白姊妹」中，看到她戴着白頭巾在修道院中隔着鐵柵門和情人泣别的時候，面對着聖壇剪髮的時候，那種嚴肅的Ｓentiment，擊碎了每一個觀衆的情懷，在「戰地情天」中，當她在英雄的銅像前接受了情人恩愛的時候，那一種熱烈而怯弱的内心表演，也祗有她才有如此眞實的情感。像這樣的表演技巧，無論如何，是値得我們竭誠注意的。同樣，在這一影片中，她寫出了自身對於丈夫的熱愛，雖然丈夫的愛情並不如自已所理想的那般甜蜜，雖然夫家的人們常對自身加以難堪的戲弄，但是她忍耐着，她仍然捧着整個純潔的心而等候愛情的復活。然而她始終一個怯弱者，她終於接受了姪兒的情愛，雖然她也理智的覺着這種行動的不當。尤其是在那打破了石膏像的高潮之後，丈夫憤怒而出，她抱着姪兒接吻而又推開他的時候，那種矛盾心情之深刻表現，眞顯出她獨到的才能。</p>
<p>同時，　丈夫的洛伯特蒙高茂萊，也是和在「紐約一婦人」，「兩婦之間難爲夫，」二片中一様，一貫的那般輕鬆佻達，瀟洒風流。不是麽？一個演員有了他特殊的個性，總可以在適當的劇本中獲得長足的成功。在這裏，我們雖然不能看出他比以前更有猛烈的進展，然而他適當的盡了他應有的責任却是非常明白的事實。我們看，當他在看報的時候，不耐煩的問着「誰打開了那窗子，」更眼看着姪兒帶着妻子出門的時候，以及看着妻和姪子痴情的跳舞，在母親家裏等待，淘氣了一夜的妻子來找他的時候，都是别人難於做到的哭笑不得的塲面。</p>
<p>除了主角之外，其餘諸配角，也都十分盡職。甚至於那青年ＪohoＢeal也極力拿出了那純樸而豐富的情感，如打碎石膏像的前後，如在祖母家給父母追問着昨晚之去處的時候。</p>
<p>有了優秀的演員，無論如何，總使作品獲得大部份的成功。反之，中國電影在目前的狀態之下，其内容的充實，未嘗不駕於美國影片之上，可是常因爲缺乏好的演員，不能夠隨着一切技巧在畫面上完美的表現出來。</p>
<p>我們决不能否認美國片已經有了成熟的演出技巧，尤其是不少演員能有充分的學識上的修養，更爲其影片生色不少。因此附帶的勸告中國的電影演員們，不必使用全部精力來徒鶩虛名，一定要努力的在修養上提高自身的技藝，同時對於中國電影盡了極大的責任，假使他們或她們也認識了中國電影之前途的話。</p>
<p>說了幾句題外的話，但這决不是廢話。現在再說到「媳婦淚」的其他各方面。</p>
<p>首先我們得注意這一劇本的構成，這是一個非常文學的，而描寫細緻的作品。常有人說純文藝的電影不爲一般觀衆所歡迎，（「春蠶」不像「滿江紅」那般賣座，便是好例。）但是這種劇本自有它極高的價値，也是無可否認的。即如這一影片，我們無論如何，也得承認劇作者描寫手段的高强。</p>
<p>他取材於小市爾喬亞汜的家庭小事，細緻的寫出少年夫婦　那種普通常有的愛情的波折。我想凡是結過婚的人，都有這種奇怪的經騐，不管自身對於對方的愛情是如何的信任，然而總會有幾次淘氣。等到一番平心靜氣的解釋之後，自會和好如初。</p>
<p>在這裏使我們連想起「陌路幽情」，那是說明因經濟拮据致使丈夫任性的煩惱，而與妻子决裂，直至十年之後，才重復團圓。「陌路幽情」能指明這經濟的關係，自然是比這「媳婦淚」更爲强調一些。但是後者也寫實的描寫這種小事，很坦白的寫小布爾喬亞汜生活的一部，也極有它存在的價値。至於描寫的細膩，我們只消在姪兒親手擊碎叔父的彫像，或妯娣們小氣的吃糕餅上表現出來。</p>
<p>導演的高强，因限於篇幅，不能細說，很明顯的導演在這裏有着極大的成功。</p>
<h3>「三鏢客」評　丨中央映丨　▲發一點議論</h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>因爲觀衆的要求，中國電影的題材，大槪都要多少觸到些社會的現實。這一點，即使比較落後的所謂「小公司」的出品，也反映了出來。最近開映的一「血路」，「晨曦」，即其明證。但歷史的發展，永遠是曲線酌。在「狂流」之後，在「春蠶」之前，居然有所謂「滿江紅」也者，給我們看。那末，攝製於兩年之前的武俠片「三鏢客」放映於今日，我們也用不到驚異吧！</p>
<p>「火燒紅蓮寺」禁止了，說是太荒誕，而美國的西部影片却充斥於市場。當然，「火燒紅蓮寺」和「西部影片」是有一點不不同的，这不同只在於程度上，而不在本質上。所以在目前很多人難認中國電影在内容方面，已經突過了美國片，幷不是没有理由的。那末「三鏢客」雖則和西部影片差不多，而在中國電影的發展上，「三鏢客」的放映，不得不認爲較嚴重的。</p>
<p>但是由「三鏢客」這張片子，我們看到中國電影的進步，不但在内容方面，就是技術方面，（包括導演等）也有長足的進步。而增加我們對中國電影前途的樂觀，這是閑話。</p>
<p>▲影片本身</p>
<p>「三鏢客」的故事是千篇一律的，俠義英雄，除暴安良。本來結尾還有大團圓的，就是說明書上也寫着「蕙芬蕙芳匹笪宋」，「美姑偶王斌」「三雙鴛侶及張發老翁其樂紅塵餘年」。（原文）如此而在畫面上，我們只看到王斌傷愈，接着一個風技搖曳，大槪是剪掉了，而剪掉至少是有點聰明的。</p>
<p>「三鏢客」的缺點我想具體的寫下一些：</p>
<p>一，故事方面，縣長旣然乘官船，而船夥偏是盜黨，旣是盜黨，何以不刦財於先？或響應於玉蝴蝶與「三鏢客」大戰之時，而刦財於玉蝴蝶已死之後？其他事之巧遇等，更無論矣。</p>
<p>二，導演方面，開幕時介紹人物太呆版，一個鏡頭，一個字幕，中間也是這樣，字幕太多，使觀衆的注意力隔斷。</p>
<p>三，用日光攝影，光線太差，露天佈景，衣服飄動太甚！</p>
<p>四，演員王元龍笪子春，宋莪荃皆甚惡劣。張美玉雖然不佳，但有幾個表情尙好。</p>
<h3>小說電影盛筵難再Ｄinner　at　Ｅight（九）</h3>
<p>— 馬騰</p>
<p>馬克斯走了，雷瑙德搖搖不定的站著。顫抖的手摸著他的額角。他的帽子掉了，他亦不覺得。他四面看看，但覺四週的一切，都在嘲笑他，戲弄他，威脅他。他珊蹣着跑到着衣鏡前面，自己看見自己　他用手掩蓋著自己的臉，不敢再看了。他給起那張電報來，看了一半，就擲掉了。地板上倒着一個酒瓶，他拿起來對着嘴倒着，但是理面已是一滴都没有了。他仍舊把酒瓶擲掉了。</p>
<p>一回兒飯店的經理先生又來了。他很客氣地和雷瑙德商量，請他遷讓出那間大房間，因爲一個老主顧在那間房間裏住慣了，如同家裏一樣必須要得到牠。雷瑙德問他，倘使他讓出那間房，有什麽别的房間給他住呢？那位經理說「現在正蓬着寳馬的時候，各處的人都來了，飯店裏實在一間空房都没有。勞萊聽了，做出一種怪樣子笑道：「不要緊，不要緊，我正要通知賬房我快搬了。有幾位朋友在派姆别趣請我去呢。花車已經定好了……這間房你們什麽時候要？」那經理道：「不忙，不忙，明天中午好不好？」雷瑙德下意識地黠着頭。那位經理道：「謝謝你，雷瑙德先生。使你種種不方便，實在對不起得很。」他鞠着躬出去了。</p>
<p>雷瑙德呆望著飯店的經理先生出去了。一回兒他漸漸蘇醒過來。他聽見外面馬路上有搖琴的聲音。他走近窗口看着馬路上許多團看的人。他檢起那張電報紙，從口袋袖掏出那一角七分錢來，拿在手裏看了一回兒，拿電報紙包了那錢，就從窗口擲給那位馬路音樂師了。他猛力地關上窗，退走了幾步，就倒在椅子裏了。他儘力想振作，可是已經没有振作的力量了。他眼花繚亂地望着壁爐上放的寳勒的婷婷倩影，他似夢囈似的對着它道：「讓我們設想這就是我們的家。又讓我們設想這是一個眞的火爐，而不是燒煤氣的假木頭」</p>
<p>「煤氣！煤氣！」他忽然聯想到。他彎著腰試騐了一下，極可怖的思想直攻到他瑙筋裏。他開了煤氣管子的小門，聽着煤氣嘶嘶出來的聲音，他覺得着了勝利了。他又把氣管關了起來，四面在屋子裏巡視了一週。他看屋子的四面角落裏，都有黑影子，預備立卽爬到他的身上來。他一躍而前，跑到門跟前，把鑰匙一轉，將門反鎖了。他拿身上的禮服，撕了下來，塞住了門底下的漏縫。又到浴室裏拿了許多衣服，拿所有的空縫都塞住了。他又四面巡視了一下，覺得很滿意。他拿領帶拉拉直，着了一件長袍。最後的儀容，他亦不肯一些疏忽。他又拿電燈都熄了，祗留了一盞。他把煤氣管的門又開了。他仰着躺在椅子裏，眼看着寳勒的照相。旁邊還有一個電話，他的手摸索着，要想打個電話給寳勒。　（未完）</p>

<h3>Huang Fu Revisits Okamura to Continue Discussing Traffic Issues, Four Measures Largely Agreed Upon, Discussed Postal Issues Last Night, No Further Consultations Between the Two Parties Today</h3>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, Huang Fu visited Okamura to continue discussing the issues of the Beining Road and traffic to Ping and Shen. The results were: (1) The Japanese army will be fully responsible for traffic protection matters on the Guandong section. (2) The distribution of freight fees will be divided equally between China and Japan. (3) Traffic matters outside the customs will be handled by a transportation organization established by the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company. (4) Vehicles from the pseudo-Fengshan Road will not enter the customs. The above items have been largely agreed upon. As for postal issues, due to the complexity of the content, they will be discussed at length when Ho hosts a banquet for Okamura tonight, and a solution can be decided. At this point, all issues have reached a conclusion, and no further consultations will be held tomorrow. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Okamura, his visit to meet with Huang and Ho to discuss matters in the war zone was only for preliminary discussions. Yesterday's discussion focused on the issues of the Great Wall passes. There was no discussion on postal, customs, or traffic matters. He hopes that solutions to the above issues can be obtained as soon as possible. In terms of Sino-Japanese relations, the political aspect is still difficult to open up, but the economic aspect has recently shown a trend towards rapprochement. As for Russo-Japanese relations, the Soviet Union has deployed a total of twelve or thirteen divisions of troops on the border, and there are also five or six warships constantly traveling between the Heilongjiang and Vladivostok. Its naval port is located in Vladivostok, where smaller warships are also docked. The situation is extremely tense. Japan has not made any preparations for this. It is rumored that ten Japanese aircraft flew to the Amur region for reconnaissance, which is not confirmed. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Okamura is scheduled to visit the Summer Palace on the 9th. Tomorrow evening, he will host a banquet at the Japanese Embassy to thank Ho and Huang for their hospitality. He will go to Tianjin on the 10th. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Okamura's discussions with Huang and Ho on unresolved issues in the war zone have yielded concrete results. He attended Ho's banquet last night, which ended at midnight. This morning, Huang and Ho went to the Japanese Embassy to return Okamura's visit, talking for more than two hours before leaving. Okamura will still visit various scenic spots this afternoon. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Railways has sent Xia Guangyu north to assist in negotiations regarding the Ping-Shen traffic matters. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian telegraphed Shi Qingyang, stating that they are still staying in Guihua to discuss solutions with Chuan Zuoyi. Before a proper solution is reached, it will be temporarily difficult to enter Mongolia. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, Okamura, Ho Yingqin, and Huang Fu met again for three hours. Afterwards, Okamura stated that the Japanese army is currently rushing to build barracks north of the Great Wall. Once completed, the Chinese army can take over the key passes of the Great Wall at any time. Regarding postal and customs matters, only general principles were discussed. Detailed measures will be discussed later. Regarding traffic between Beiping and Shenyang, Okamura suggested that the authorities should negotiate. No further meetings will be held between the two parties. Okamura is scheduled to meet Yu Xuezhong in Tianjin on Friday. (8th Reuters)</p>
<h3>Ariyoshi Returns to Beiping from Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Ariyoshi returned to Beiping from Tianjin tonight. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi came to Tianjin from Beiping on the 7th and visited Chairman Yu. Tanaka, the Japanese consul in Tianjin, hosted a banquet for Yu and Ariyoshi at the consulate on the same day to strengthen ties. At noon on the 8th, Yu hosted a return banquet for Ariyoshi and Tanaka at his government office. At 4 p.m., Ariyoshi left for Beiping. According to his conversation with reporters at the station, after arriving in Beiping, he will take his family south in the near future and denied that there were direct negotiations between the Chinese and Japanese authorities after his arrival in the north. However, he believes that the friendly relations between the two countries will gradually improve. (8th Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>British House of Lords Debates China Policy</h3>
<p>(London) Lord Peel will express his views during the House of Lords debate on British policy towards China today, believing that Nanjing has indeed made noticeable progress in the past six months. The current government is probably the most effective government in China for many years, holding truly practical ideas. Lord Peel will also say that British policy seems indecisive and is extremely incompatible with its great interests in the Far East and the well-being of China. China is facing great difficulties and the spread of communism and is willing to welcome assistance. Therefore, Britain must carefully observe its position in light of China's changes. Sending a new minister to China now presents a good opportunity. It is reported that those who support Lord Peel's views include Mr. Melchett, director of Imperial Chemical Industries, Mr. Aiding, former custodian of enemy property in China, and the Marquesses of Salisbury.

<h3>Central Political Council Discusses Diplomacy towards Japan, Regarding Local Negotiations in North China, Many Committee Members Expressed Opinions, To Be Further Discussed at Next Week's Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the news of local negotiations in North China, the authorities said that after the Japanese Minister Ariyoshi arrived in Beiping, he proposed negotiations to the North China authorities to resolve local issues. The content was that the Japanese side would return the passes of the Great Wall and continue to discuss the establishment of customs, traffic, and postal services. Huang Fu, the chairman of the Political Affairs Committee in Beiping, telegraphed Nanjing on the 2nd to request the opinions of the Executive Yuan on the Japanese side's request. Under the fundamental principles of not recognizing the pseudo-organization, not giving up the four eastern provinces, and the diplomatic policy of not losing rights or humiliating the country, negotiations can be considered. The sections of Huang Fu's telegram were sent to the competent authorities for careful study. The customs issue was handed over to the Ministry of Finance, the traffic issue to the Ministry of Railways, and the postal issue to the Ministry of Transportation, to formulate plans and submit written opinions separately. Premier Wang took the opportunity to fly to Jiangxi the day before yesterday to seek the opinions of Chairman Chiang on the above issues. Wang returned to Nanjing yesterday afternoon. The results are still unknown. The Central Political Council held a routine meeting yesterday morning, which has already been put forward for discussion. Many committee members expressed their opinions, which lasted about three hours. It is reported that no conclusion has been reached yet, and it will be left for further discussion at next week's meeting. It can be seen that reports that negotiations have already begun in North China are indeed not yet timely. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Political Council held its 382nd meeting at 8 a.m. on the 8th.

<h3>Ning County Magistrate Returns to City, Bandits Continue to Cause Trouble Inside the Passes, Japanese Side Suggests Pursuit, Traitor Activities in Various Counties of Luandong</h3>
<p>Changli The Ning County Magistrate Liu Xingpei passed through Changli on the morning of the 8th to return to Ning City. It has now been discovered in various counties of Luandong that there are personnel claiming to be working for the War Zone Investigation Committee, and they are distributing declarations stating that they are ordered to enter the customs for investigation. In fact, they are contacting local gentry and inciting local militias to engage in extralegal attempts. The declaration is signed by Zheng Yanhou and Liu Tiechen. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Changli After the bandits fled from Ning City, according to recent reports from the Japanese side, most of them have fled out of the passes from various passes near Huaguoshan. There are about two thousand people between Yushulin and Huashudianzi. Near Taitouying inside the passes, there are still three to four hundred people from Wenquanyu to Xingxingyu. The Japanese side suggested that we send Liu Zuozhou's troops to pursue.</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the remnants of the bandits in Ning fled towards the Taitouying area, they no longer have the ability to counterattack. The order in Ning City has not yet stabilized. The security team is searching for the remnants of the bandits. Refugees have been flocking back in recent days, but because their fields and houses have been reduced to ruins, they have no place to live and are suffering terribly. The local maintenance committee, together with the county government, is rushing to provide emergency relief to help the refugees. Also, the request by the Japanese staff officer Endo to station Liu Zuozhou's troops in Ning City is not the intention of the Japanese side, but the action of one or two soldiers and is not a problem. It has now been handed over to the provincial government for handling. (8th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Luo Wen'gan Arrives in Tianjin, Says the New Province Is Full of Good People, No Contact with Russian Diplomats, Diplomatic Opinions Are Inconvenient to Express, Scheduled to Go South to Nanjing Tonight and Then to Jiangxi Immediately, Determined to Resign from Both the Foreign Affairs and Justice Ministries</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Luo Wen'gan arrived outside Dagu Port at 5 p.m. on the 8th and immediately boarded the Haihai gunboat with his secretary Lin Donghai and Wang Lanjin, bringing four pieces of luggage and a hunting rifle. Luo was in good spirits. He arrived in Tanggu at 7:30 p.m., boarded a special train, and made a prepared speech to reporters from Beiping, Tianjin, Nanjing, Shanghai, and Wuhan. The special train departed at 9 p.m. Luo talked to reporters on the train as follows: Regarding diplomatic events, I am sorry that it is inconvenient for me to express my opinion. For example, when four people are playing cards, they are all scheming and cannot show their cards to others. I took a plane from Nanjing, passed through Shaanxi and entered Xinjiang, stayed in Dihua for five days, and then took the Touxi Railway to New Asia and then to Asia before arriving in Vladivostok. My impression of the Soviet Union is that everyone has a job and everyone has food to eat. Modern women who have no food to eat are despised. I telegraphed Dean Hu of Tianjin, setting the 8th as the date of arrival in Tianjin, but unexpectedly, the code was unclear and translated into the word "trap," causing everyone to wait for many days, which I deeply regret. My eye disease has healed, I eat three meals a day, I don't drink alcohol, and I don't know what pain is. The Sino-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty was carried out when I was in Nanjing. What I can tell you now is that because I entered Russian territory, I did not have any formal contact with Soviet diplomats. I don't understand Russian and cannot know the details of the Soviet Union's national conditions, but I know that its construction industry has made amazing progress. As far as the situation in the new province is concerned, I feel that they are all good people. Only with laws can they live and work in peace, and only if there is no war can there be construction. On August 27, Ma Zhongying and Sheng Shicai started a fire. When I arrived in the new province, I heard that Sheng had retreated to the provincial capital. I don't know what happened later. The climate on the new border is uneven. Morning, noon, evening, and night are like spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Jin Shuren used high-handed tactics against the people in the new province. The people in a certain city were all killed, causing the people in the new province to have no choice but to welcome foreigners with food and drink. I feel that Russia is not to be feared. What is to be feared is our own trouble. The current situation between China and Japan is like two men sleeping with one woman, which is already indecent, and to insist on talking about marriage is not a joke. I am determined to resign from both the Minister of Foreign Affairs and the Minister of Justice. He arrived in Tianjin at 10 p.m. and rested at the Six Nations Hotel. At 10:30 p.m., Hu Xianglin and Zhou Zuhai, the presidents of the Higher Court, hosted a welcome banquet at Dongxinglou. Luo is scheduled to go south to Nanjing on the night of the 9th and will go to Jiangxi immediately after arriving in Nanjing to visit Chiang. (8th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported that Luo Wen'gan's mission for this inspection of Xinjiang was to investigate the contents of the secret agreement signed by Jin Shuren and the Soviet Union in Dihua in order to declare it invalid to Russia, and to expose Jin's crimes. After Luo arrives in Tianjin, he will come to Beiping for a while to meet with the authorities. (8th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Rectifying Military Discipline</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>It is reported that Chairman Chiang has issued a strict order to rectify military discipline in order to eliminate the malpractices of the army. He has warned officers and soldiers to treat the people as if they were wounded and not to arbitrarily extort money from the people by relying on force. These words are not only what the people of the country are eagerly hoping for at the moment, but also have extremely important significance on this day when bandits are rampant and the army is advancing to suppress them. Therefore, I dare to borrow Chairman Chiang's words to discuss it.</p>
<p>Our country supports an army of 2.7 million, which costs the national treasury 340 million yuan annually, accounting for more than 80% of the total annual expenditure. The conscription of troops stationed in other provinces is not included. The only hope of the people, who exhaust their efforts to support the army, is that the army will be the armed force of the people themselves, able to defend the country and maintain the local people. However, looking back at the facts of the past twenty years, the army not only does not serve as the armed force of the people, but also participates in civil wars, often causing the people in the war zone to suffer the pain of family ruin and death. Even in peacetime, there are unavoidable acts of bullying. As Chairman Chiang said, those who arbitrarily extort money by relying on force cause the people to fear officers and soldiers like tigers, and a gap arises between the people and the army.</p>
<p>Therefore, today, if military discipline can be rectified, the people will be like clouds in a great drought. If each division and brigade can refrain from even the slightest offense while advancing to suppress bandits in the bandit areas, and everywhere comfort the victims of disasters, show sympathy for the difficult, and comfort the sick, then not only can the past impression of the people towards the army be changed, but also the great effect of integrating the people and the army can be achieved. The facts of cooperation between the army and the people during the Northern Expedition in the past are still vividly in our memory.</p>
<p>So, what is the crux of the problem of why military discipline is not strict? Today's general commentators often say that soldiers have low levels of knowledge, or that soldiers' salaries are meager. These are all reasonable points. However, can soldiers with low levels of knowledge be absolutely impossible to use well? Can meager salaries be absolutely impossible to maintain their lives? We believe that soldiers with low levels of knowledge, if they have good officers to guide them, make them understand the great righteousness of patriotism, and do not drive them as private tools, can also be transformed into useful and healthy children of the country. As for the meager salaries, under today's living standards, if the soldiers' due salaries can be paid out monthly, then even if they cannot have a rich life, they will not suffer from hunger and cold. What is worrying is that the soldiers' salaries are already meager, but they are also intercepted by officers, or even dragged on for years without being paid. Then the soldiers will truly have no way to maintain their lives, and the idea of illegality will arise. The fault lies in the officers' poor training and their exclusive focus on self-interest without considering the soldiers. Moreover, if the generals are focused on promotion and fortune, then their thoughts of loving the country and loving the people are less, and they have no time to consider the deep relationship between the people and the army. As a result, the phenomenon of the people and the army being separated into two is formed.</p>
<p>Therefore, in seeking the rectification of military discipline today, we believe that the officers of each army should first suddenly awaken and strive to eliminate the mistakes of the past. Then, with strict military orders, rectify the troops and change the accumulated abuses of the past. The masses and the army can love, be close to, and help each other, and then the army and the masses can become one. Then the army will truly become the armed force of the people. In this way, not only can the victory of suppressing bandits be expected, but also foreign insults will not be feared. May the generals of each army deeply understand Chairman Chiang's words.</p>
<p>The relationship between Japan and Russia is increasingly dangerous.</p>
<h3>Russia's Leader Blatantly Expresses Himself, Causing Great Unease in Japan and Korea: Considered a Deliberate Challenge, Ambassador to Russia May Be Recalled</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) On the 6th, the Soviet Union held a grand meeting commemorating the 16th anniversary of the October Revolution. Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, delivered a speech at the meeting, believing that an attack by Japan was unavoidable and that the Soviet Union was always fully prepared for a sudden attack by Japan. The sole responsibility of the Red Army was to completely defeat the enemy and ensure its victory. After Molotov's speech, which highly praised the Red Army, reached Japan, all sectors of society were indignant at the Soviet Union's arrogant and challenging attitude. Government authorities also attached great importance to the matter, stating their attitude toward Russia. The entire nation should not be misled by talk of Russo-Japanese friendship, but should quickly establish a complete national policy toward Russia. The government believes that Molotov's speech was a second tactic to challenge Japan, aimed at gaining a favorable position, after the previous incident of the "strange document" had no major impact on Japan. His intentions are as follows: (1) At the time when Litvinov was visiting the United States to begin negotiations on the re-establishment of US-Soviet relations, he deliberately released an atmosphere of worsening Japanese-Russian relations in order to force the United States to recognize the Soviet Union, as a strategy to contain Japan. (2) To stimulate the Japanese military to actively carry out war preparations against Russia, inducing anti-military sentiment among the Japanese people, with the aim of creating internal turmoil in Japan. If the Japanese authorities take such remarks from the Russian side as domestic policy teaching and stand idly by, it will only allow the Soviet Union to inflate its arrogance and promote Soviet ideology to the world, which will inevitably lead to major events between the two countries. This is a very obvious fact. At this important juncture, the Japanese government and the public should quickly unify national opinion and express important intentions to the Soviet Union, namely, to implement countermeasures against the Soviet Union's political and diplomatic aims focused on "strength." Unless the Soviet Union changes its challenging attitude toward Japan, it will consistently respond with a tough policy toward Russia. The first step of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' plan is to urgently recall Ambassador to Russia Ota to hear about the actual situation in Russia and to study what attitude the Soviet Union will adopt toward Japan in the future. On the surface, Russo-Japanese relations are disguised as peaceful through the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, but in reality, the undercurrents between the two countries are gradually emerging.

<h3>Japanese Authorities Deliberately Show Calm, Claiming It Was Intended for Domestic Consumption</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The sharp speech made by Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, yesterday, is not given much importance here, as it is intended to divert the people's, especially the farmers', attention from their own suffering. Spokesmen for both the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Army stated that Molotov's speech was not worth mentioning and was unlikely to disturb the Japanese people. Japanese newspapers also completely ignored it. The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said, "We do not pay attention to what Molotov said. We cannot interfere with his thinking." When asked if Molotov intended to sway the United States, the spokesman replied, "The United States is very wise and will not be swayed by Molotov. Molotov's remarks first attacked France, then England, then the Vatican, and then Japan. I really do not understand his true intentions." The spokesman for the Ministry of the Army said, "The people of the Soviet Union are suffering unspeakably from the brutal implementation of the Five-Year Plan, not to mention the invasion of famine. Molotov's remarks are intended to stabilize people's hearts, and since rebellions have occurred in several places in the Soviet Union, Molotov suddenly issued a speech challenging Japan, in fact, to shift the people's attention abroad and forget their domestic suffering. The Soviet Union is now concentrating troops on the border between Biran and 'Manchukuo' and is dealing with Japan by destroying international credibility. This is very noteworthy."

<h3>Full Text of Molotov's Speech</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Moscow Soviet held a solemn meeting yesterday to commemorate the 16th anniversary of the October Revolution. Representatives from various agencies, factories, and trade unions attended. Stalin, Molotov, Kalinin, Kaganovich, and several members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union presided over the meeting. The audience welcomed them warmly as they took their seats. Then, Molotov, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars, delivered the main speech. He began by saying that the great achievements of the First Five-Year Plan had been summarized at the beginning of this year, and there was no need to repeat the results. In the past October alone, the results and victories of the First Five-Year Plan have been fully demonstrated, which is only the beginning of the Soviet Union's success. At present, there is no other country in the world that is carrying out construction work like the Soviet Union. Only the Soviet Union is diligently engaged in construction work, investing millions to develop industry and consolidate national power. At the same time, the panic in capitalist countries has not diminished, and various attempts to continue to reduce this panic have not been successful. Capitalism has indeed failed to find a way out of panic. The number of countries ruled by the bourgeoisie and fascist forces has been increasing, and they have incited the reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie, ignited the dim enthusiasm of nationalism, and frankly exposed the entire essence of their policies. At the same time, they have revealed the fact that the possibility of getting out of panic by reorganizing internally is decreasing, so they are increasingly devoted to war and the competition of armaments. As for the Soviet Union, it has always implemented its policy of consolidating friendship with various countries and has mobilized all its strength to oppose war and strive for peace." Molotov then elaborated on several issues concerning the economic life of the Soviet Union, saying, "To this day, we have been able to steadily increase the productivity of a large number of new and old factories and industrial sectors that have sprung up in recent years." When Molotov mentioned the development of agriculture, he elaborated on the achievements of collective farms, saying that the state has collected 100 million poods of grain, which has exceeded the total amount of the entire year last year. When Molotov discussed the Soviet Union's foreign policy, he emphasized that even most of the Soviet Union's enemies have had to admit the Soviet government's peaceful policy, which has always been the foundation of the Soviet Union's foreign policy. The Soviet Union's foreign policy is directly linked to the success of economic and cultural construction, which has greatly consolidated the Soviet Union's international position. From this point of view, President Roosevelt's proposal to the Soviet government to appoint representatives to discuss US-Soviet relations is very important. The significance of the negotiations between Roosevelt and Litvinov is not limited to the United States and the Soviet Union, but also has international importance. We do not want to guess what the outcome of the Washington talks will be. Kalinin's reply has strongly stated our position, saying that if there are or will be various difficulties between the two countries, these difficulties "can undoubtedly only be resolved when there is direct contact between the two countries. Conversely, if this contact is lacking, these difficulties can never be resolved." I would like to express this belief that the meeting between Litvinov and the US President will have a satisfactory result for the interests of both countries and world peace. However, although the Soviet Union is loyal to its peaceful policy, the implementation of this policy does not only depend on ourselves. At present, the danger of military attacks on us is particularly serious, so we must pay special attention to the imperialist plans to disrupt peace, the situation in the Far East, and our relations with Japan. These issues, whether in the past or now, are issues of particular concern to our workers. Our policy in the Far East and our relations with our neighbors in the Far East will always be peaceful, and we will strive to maintain peaceful relations with them. Examples include the request for Japan to sign a non-aggression pact and the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway. We will not change this policy at present. However, we must take into account the Manchurian Incident, the destruction of the agreements concluded with us, and the fact that the policy of destroying these agreements is being vigorously implemented. We understand that our task is to expose the truth of all such actions, thoroughly defend the interests of the Soviet Union, and always protect the borders of the Soviet Union. When we read the ridiculous plans of some Japanese dignitaries to seize Siberia and the coastal areas, and when these arguments and plans beneficial to them become more and more frank and shameless, we have to pay close attention to them. "The Manchurian government is not an important factor in these issues. The world knows that Japan is the actual master of Manchukuo, and the responsibility should also be borne by Japan." Molotov then spoke about some of the remarks made by the Japanese, saying that Europeans thought it was too stupid to declare war before starting military action. Molotov then said, "These gentlemen are in favor of launching a sudden attack on the Soviet Union as soon as possible. We cannot ignore these remarks. They are forcing us to fully prepare for this unexpected and serious attack. We have considered these facts in the necessary ways. We are now convinced that our main task is to expose all adventurous actions that disrupt peace, strengthen the Red Army and national defense, and vigorously implement a policy of peace and good-neighborly relations with our neighbors. If the time for the enemy to attack the Soviet Union comes, our only task will be to completely defeat the enemy and achieve the victory of our Red Army. The imperialists' preparations for war are not only expanding in the East, but also in the West. When we pay attention to these events, we must observe the events in the Far East with special attention. We have strengthened and are strengthening the strength of the Red Army. We are convinced that these military leaders will understand what it means to succumb to this invincible Red Army when the necessary opportunity arises." Molotov's speech ended in cheers from the entire audience. (7th, TASS)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ronin Disgrace the National Image by Planting Opium in Leased Territory in East Africa; Japanese Representative Declares That This Did Not Happen</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It was rumored that the East African country of Abyssinia wanted to lease land to Japan to plant opium. At a meeting of the Opium Advisory Committee yesterday, the Japanese representative declared that this was not true. Today, the Secretariat of the League of Nations issued a special bulletin, mentioning the declaration of the Japanese representative yesterday, stating that the rumor of Abyssinia leasing land to plant opium originated from a telegram published in the Osaka Asahi Shimbun, which was done by a ronin named Kitagawa. The bulletin concluded by saying that the Japanese representative of the Opium Advisory Committee believed that it was regrettable that this kind of ronin conspiracy incident had resulted in rumors that disgraced Japan's national image. He hoped that this statement would be sufficient to dispel all misunderstandings, and he hoped that the official declaration of the Japanese representative would be heard by the international press. (8th, Havas)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Japanese representative to the Opium Advisory Committee, Yokoyama, issued an important statement today regarding the rumor that Japan had obtained a concession in Abyssinia to plant poppies. According to the statement, he had sent a telegram to Tokyo inquiring about the details because the news had caused reasonable alarm. He has now learned that a destitute adventurer named Kida claimed to have obtained a concession in Abyssinia in order to glorify himself. This is a strategy that cannot be believed. He wishes to inform the world to dispel doubts. In any case, the Abyssinian government must prohibit the planting of poppies within its borders. This afternoon, the Opium Committee passed a draft of articles inquiring about the implementation of Chapter 4 of the Hague Convention, which will be sent to the Chinese government and the authorities of the leased territories in China. The draft report mentions the current situation in China, especially the danger of establishing secret drug manufacturing plants in the area, which is a source of great concern for China and the world.

<h3>Japanese Goods Infiltrate Everywhere and Develop into Iraq</h3>
<p>(London) The Department of Commerce received a report from the commercial counselor of the British Embassy in Iraq, which was released this morning. It stated that Japanese goods are competing in the Iraqi market and are developing greatly. Cotton merchants who used to trade with Manchester in England are now mostly purchasing goods from Japan, and the Iraqi government has also changed its source of supply for the cloth used to make military uniforms to Tokyo. The commercial counselor pointed out several figures to prove the increase in Japanese exports to Iraq. Compared to the 1930-31 and 1931-32 fiscal years, Japanese cloth imports to Iraq increased from 298,000 meters to 325,000 meters, but British cloth exports to Iraq remained the same. (8th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt Receives Russian Foreign Minister in White House Blue Room: Conversation Filled with Friendly Spirit; US-Soviet Diplomatic Recognition to Be Realized Soon</h3>
<p>(Washington) Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov arrived at Union Station in this city at 3:45 this afternoon. US Secretary of State Hull and other dignitaries were at the station to welcome him. Litvinov then went to the White House at 5:20 and was received by the US President in the Blue Room of the White House. Afterwards, according to Litvinov's remarks to reporters, he was deeply moved by the President's sincere attitude and friendly spirit. He had issued a statement when he landed in Jersey City this morning, saying that he was confident that an agreement could be reached soon, including a commercial treaty that would hopefully greatly increase trade between the two sides. Now that he has paid a visit to the President tonight, he feels that his statement was not overly optimistic. (7th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to today's news, the first purpose of Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov's mission to the United States is to restore Russian-American relations and to conclude a commercial treaty as soon as possible. Other issues, such as the non-aggression pact, the elimination of malicious propaganda, and the claims for compensation by the Russian and American people, will be left to diplomats to handle. It is heard that the former Russian ambassador to Japan, Troyanovsky, may be appointed as the first Russian ambassador to the United States. It is also heard that President Roosevelt has decided not to seek a formal treaty in the current negotiations. (8th, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Washington) Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov has had his first meeting with President Roosevelt, lasting 20 minutes. It was purely a courtesy visit. Most people believe that the United States will recognize Russia in a matter of hours. The issue of prohibiting the propagation of communism seems easy to resolve, while the debts owed to the United States by the Imperial Russian and Provisional governments are more difficult to resolve, as the Soviet government has always refused to acknowledge debts of a political nature incurred by previous Russian governments. Regarding commercial issues, it is generally believed that the Soviet Union can place orders in the American market for as much as $100 million, but cannot pay in cash immediately. The American side may allow credit for 10 to 15 years. It is generally believed that Russia will order the first batch of goods starting this week, namely wheat, seeds, and livestock. Before visiting Roosevelt, Litvinov declared to the press that his talks with the President would proceed smoothly because "the Soviet Union has countless precedents for restoring diplomatic relations with other countries and establishing peaceful cooperation, which can be used as a reference. The United States and Russia are about to discuss various issues, which can be used as examples." This shows that the Soviet Union's view on the war debt issue will not change because of the United States. (7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Litvinov Makes a Statement in New York, Saying That There Is Absolutely No Possibility of Conflict Between the Two Countries and That He Has Infinite Hope for the Future of Diplomatic Relations</h3>
<p>(New York) Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov arrived here at 9:30 this morning. He was greeted on board by the director of the State Department's Office of Protocol and various dignitaries concerned about US-Russian relations. The reception ceremony was the same as that for envoys sent by countries that the United States has already recognized. Litvinov told reporters that he very much hoped that after the restoration of US-Russian diplomatic relations, he would be able to achieve "genuine disarmament." When asked about the mission of his visit, Litvinov replied, "I will not negotiate any treaties during my visit to the United States." He then took a ferry to Jersey City, where he transferred to a special train to Washington. Before the train departed, Litvinov declared to reporters, "I have infinite hope for the mission of this trip and the future of US-Russian diplomatic relations. The two countries have no disputes in history and will not have any conflicts in the future. Moreover, both countries control natural resources with human power to meet human needs. Therefore, the United States and Russia, as the most technologically advanced countries in the world, have a mutual attraction. All we have to do is to find a way to formally recognize this mutual attraction. The two countries have a solid foundation for cooperation in economics, technology, and culture. If we can develop it, it will be beneficial to both countries. The only thing both countries hope for is peace." (7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>Train Arrives in Washington, Hull Welcomes at the Station</h3>
<p>(Washington) Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov has arrived here. Only a few official representatives of the press were allowed to enter the station. Secretary of State Hull welcomed him at the station, exchanging pleasantries. Others who came to the station to greet him included Under Secretary of State Phillips and Roosevelt's personal representative, McIntyre. The station was crowded with onlookers on both sides. When Litvinov left the station, he was protected by more than 100 police officers. (7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>US-Russian Relations: White House Makes Preparations in Advance</h3>
<p>(Washington) As Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov disembarked in New York, several people in the US official circles gathered to discuss US-Russian relations. Secretary of State Hull, Director of the Agricultural Relief Bureau Morgenthau, and Assistant Secretary of State Berle will all participate when the President meets with Litvinov. Therefore, preparations were made in advance. After the meeting, Secretary of State Hull went to the White House to pay a visit to the President. (7th, Havas)</p>
<h3>British-American Negotiations Suspended to Handle Debts to Russia</h3>
<p>(Washington) After the British-American war debt negotiations were announced today that Britain would pay a small amount of promissory notes in mid-December, they were effectively suspended, and Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov arrived here this afternoon to discuss another, more complex debt issue in preparation for the restoration of US-Russian diplomatic relations. When the White House announced the suspension of British-American negotiations, it stated that the British war debt issue could not be resolved due to the turbulent world situation, so it had accepted the British method of paying promissory notes. The President will not recognize Britain's failure to fulfill its debt obligations, and this suspension of negotiations does not prevent any government from negotiating in the future.

He also planned to meet with French Prime Minister Sarraut and Foreign Minister Pangou when passing through Paris. Now Simon has canceled his trip to Geneva.

<h3>Hitler Scheduled to Give Nationwide Radio Address Tomorrow to Awaken Public Support for Current Government; Withdrawal from League of Nations to Be Decided by Public Vote; Cabinet Reorganization Rumors Are Nonsense</h3>
<p>(Berlin) This Friday, the 5th, will be the climax of this parliamentary election and the referendum on Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations. On that afternoon, from 1:00 p.m. to 2:00 p.m., all factories across the country will stop work for one hour and gather in public places to listen to the radio broadcast of Prime Minister Hitler's speech. The general idea of ​​Hitler's speech is to awaken the unanimous support of the entire German people for the current government, to strive for equality and peace in the world, and to express the unity of the entire German people. At the same time, when Germany hears the bell ringing once, all traffic will stop, all pedestrians will stop, and be silent for one minute. All factories will sound their sirens to report the start of the Prime Minister's speech. Furthermore, this speech will also be broadcast simultaneously in all schools and homes, so it can be said to be an unprecedented broadcasting demonstration. It is also heard that President Hindenburg will also deliver a speech to the nation on Saturday, which is his first since his speech on the last Labor Day, so it is especially valued by the people. (7th, National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Recently, there have been rumors that the German cabinet will be reorganized after the general election in Germany on the 12th of this month. According to reliable sources here, this statement is completely unfounded. The German cabinet is still unanimously supporting Hitler's policies, and it can be said that there is internal and external unity, and there is no talk of wavering. (7th, National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Hitler's Autographed Letter of Regards</h3>
<p>Rome: When Prussian Prime Minister Hermann Göring of Germany met with Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini today, he presented Mussolini with an autographed letter from German Chancellor Adolf Hitler. Subsequently, the Italian Prime Minister issued a statement saying that the autographed letter from the German Chancellor expressed gratitude to Mussolini for his efforts in the equal management of international relations and stated Germany's current position on the issue of disarmament. It is said that during Göring's meeting with Mussolini, he also elaborated on Germany's position in detail and the talks lasted for a long time. Mussolini held a grand banquet on Tuesday to entertain Göring, who will leave Italy tomorrow morning to return to Germany. The Italian public also attaches great importance to Göring's mission to Italy this time. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>Rome: People here unanimously believe that Prussian Prime Minister Göring's visit to Italy is the first step in Germany's awakening. After Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, other countries ignored it. Germany realized that it could not remain isolated diplomatically for long. Italian officials believe that Göring's visit is not only to seek assistance from the Italian government, but also has a more concrete purpose. Italy has close ties with Britain and France, and Germany wants to use the Four-Power Pact to leverage Italy's power to approach Britain and France. (Havas Telegram, 8th)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Debates Germany's Withdrawal from the League: Simon Claims the Door to Mediation Remains Open, Eden Defends France's Position, Conservatives Criticize Germany as Warlike, Liberal Party Alone Expresses Sympathy for Germany, French Foreign Minister Reintroduces Arms Control System, Hoping for Unified Action by All Countries Against Germany</h3>
<p>(London) British Foreign Secretary Simon, at the reopening of Parliament today, first debated disarmament, saying that although the situation is serious, some speakers have exaggerated. Britain seeks calmness and does not know what is called panic. There is no reason for Hitler to dissolve the parliament and hold elections when he withdraws from the League of Nations, taking such alarming means. The German Foreign Minister Neurath's speech yesterday criticizing the League of Nations shows that this kind of step has long been planned. Britain's failure to promote disarmament has greatly reduced its own military strength. The Labour leader Cripps's claim that Britain has taken no action is not true. Those who request fair treatment for Germany must not forget that Britain should also receive fair treatment. Britain has been at the forefront of restoring Germany's equal status, eliminating discrimination against Germany, and making Germany a member of the League of Nations and a member of the Administrative Council. Moreover, Britain has been instrumental in the withdrawal of troops from the Rhineland, and the history of reparations from the Dawes Plan to Lausanne is another evidence of Britain's actions. The Four-Power Pact has stipulated the principle of German equality, but Germany's recent declarations have made international disarmament work even more difficult. What is gratifying is that France and Italy have recently drawn closer. Britain's greatest purpose is to carry out disarmament. Britain will use its moral authority to seek friendship and peace among all countries. Simon reiterated his defense of Britain's actions to promote disarmament, stating that Germany could revoke its decision to withdraw from the League of Nations, and that all countries must sincerely hope that events will allow Germany to rejoin the League of Nations. Many events will occur in the next two years, and Britain will devote all its efforts to reconciliation. After consulting with French jurists, the British government now holds a view on the effectiveness of the Locarno Treaty, believing that the withdrawal of any country from this treaty does not release other countries from their obligations. If Germany does withdraw from this treaty, it will raise issues of a very serious nature, which cannot be publicly stated without careful consideration and consultation with other countries. He advised the people of the country not to regard the door currently closed by Germany as having been locked and bolted. Britain must use every opportunity to engage with Germany, just as it engages with other signatories of the Locarno Treaty. Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain spoke out against Germany's warmongering spirit, saying that the Treaty of Versailles did not stipulate that the victorious countries would disarm to the same extent as the defeated countries, but hoped that German disarmament would be the first step towards general arms limitation. Liberal leader George spoke, citing various figures to show the increase in armaments after the war, saying that since the conclusion of the Locarno Treaty, France has increased cannons and bombers by 50 percent. In 1914, France had 35,000 tons of pursuit ships, but today it has increased to 198,000 tons. The United States had 40,000 tons of destroyers in 1914, but now it has increased to 259,000 tons. However, the United States and France are talking about peace more than other countries. France has increased its military budget twice after the signing of the Locarno Treaty, and the United States has also increased it from 590 million yuan to 709 million yuan. George also said that it is unknown to the world that Germany cannot manufacture cannons, so there is no reason to stipulate a trial period. Former Naval Minister, Conservative Party member Amery, said that Germany is now rearming, and no one can stop it. It is urgent to reconsider British policy. Britain should no longer entangle France and others to make them participate in disarmament. Britain should no longer interfere too much in European affairs, but should strengthen ties with the United States to deal with matters in British autonomous territories. Former Finance Minister, Conservative Party member Churchill, spoke, refuting George's defense of Germany, saying that the philosophy of bloodshed is now being injected into the hearts of German youth, and it is no wonder that neighboring countries are terrified by it. Britain should not leave the European League of Nations, but should speak to Germany collectively. All countries should collectively relieve Germany of some of its suffering, and not wait until its military equipment is restored to a stage where it can endanger world peace. Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs Eden then rose to make concluding remarks, saying that if Europe had accepted the British disarmament convention in March of this year, we could have reduced the term of military service to eight months, and all heavy artillery and tanks could have been abolished. If a plan to manage civil aviation could be drafted, then land, sea, and air forces could also disappear. Some people have pointed out that British arms factories are thriving because of the development of the automobile business. A certain manufacturer said that slums were destroyed by explosives, which greatly increased its business. The crowd was amused by this. Eden continued, saying that Britain had previously promulgated a very effective system to manage the export of military supplies. Britain is still doing so. Eden later defended France, saying that France was not the one who left the meeting, so we must speak cautiously. While we want to be fair to Germany, we cannot be unfair to other parties. Eden concluded by saying that there is no reason to be disappointed. Today's debate has shown that isolation has no friends. Germany's previous accession to the League of Nations was largely promoted by British policy. Britain still hopes that Germany can withdraw its notice of withdrawal before the two-year notice period expires. Thus, the debate in the House of Commons ended with this optimistic remark.

<p>(Paris) Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour today explained to the Senate France's foreign policy after Germany's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. Paul-Boncour explained the changes that have taken place in the plan for mutual and permanent universal arms control, and said that some countries have already approved the principle that the arms control system should be tested for several years. Unexpectedly, when the Paris consideration method was gradually determined by the presidium of the Disarmament Conference, Germany suddenly withdrew from the conference. Regarding the rearmament of Germany, Paul-Boncour said that all countries must first take unified diplomatic action to prevent it. Paul-Boncour concluded that the French government is paying close attention to this issue, and at the same time has ordered all embassies to pay attention at all times. The General Committee of the Disarmament Conference will still discuss this matter on December 4. (Havas Telegram, 7th)</p>
<h3>Street Fights Erupt in New York City Mayoral Election, Nothing More Than a Struggle for Jobs, La Guardia Elected Mayor</h3>
<p>(New York) La Guardia was elected Mayor of New York City with approximately 200,000 votes. (Reuters Telegram, 7th)</p>
<p>(New York) Today's mayoral election here was the most intense and disorderly competition seen in decades. Mayoral candidate La Guardia, in a fit of rage, actually fought with 20 thugs from the Tammany Hall party in the streets, and there were also fierce clashes in various electoral districts of Greater New York City. The New York City government has been controlled by the Tammany Hall party for a long time. If the current mayor, O'Brien, whom they support, fails, more than several thousand people will lose their jobs. Therefore, in this three-way election, they must fight to the death. Therefore, they widely dispatched party members to intimidate voters from other parties or prevent them from voting. Today, La Guardia personally patrolled the streets to investigate whether there were any intimidation of voters. When he arrived in a certain district, he saw 20 Tammany Hall thugs in front of a polling station, pushing away voters from other parties, and some of them were wearing the insignia of Curry or McKee. Because he wanted to call the police to intervene, but there were no police nearby, and he was familiar with boxing, in a fit of rage, he personally got out of the car and swung several punches, and all 20 thugs were defeated. When the police arrived after being summoned, they arrested most of these people. Similar fights also occurred on other thoroughfares, but the leaders of the election campaigns of La Guardia and McKee were not as powerful as La Guardia, and were mostly beaten and injured. However, the Tammany Hall party also claimed that some of its members had been beaten, and claimed that some street fights were started by the opposing party, hoping to gain the sympathy of the public. According to the report when the vote count was nearing completion at 11:00 PM tonight, La Guardia had won a great victory, having obtained 329,191 votes. His strong opponent McKee (independent Democratic candidate) only had 249,754 votes, and the Tammany Hall candidate O'Brien only had 238,205 votes. La Guardia is a Republican candidate, and many Republican figures support him. (National Telegram, 7th)</p>

<h3>Specialist from Academia Sinica Collects Meteorites and Takes Them to Nanjing: Fell in Shadun Township, Dangtu, Three Times Heavier Than Ordinary Rocks</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Zuwang, dispatched by Academia Sinica to Dangtu to collect meteorites, took them to Nanjing today. According to him, a large number of meteorites did fall in the area from Shadun Township, Bowang Town, to Changliuzui on the evening of the 23rd of last month. The larger ones were as big as a dou (a Chinese peck measure), and the smaller ones were as small as fists. Before they fell, a strong sound like an airplane passing by was heard in the sky, and purple-green lightning was seen at the same time. The meteorites fell one after another, covering an area of 15 li (a Chinese unit of distance). Fortunately, the area is located near Shijiu Lake and is a remote area. Most of the meteorites fell into the lake and in the fields, so no one was injured. The people in the area, fearing that they were violent, mostly threw them into Shijiu Lake. Later, after explanation by those who knew a little science, they thought they were rare commodities and collected them one after another. The heads of villages and towns offered ten pieces for research in Nanjing. According to reports, these meteorites are small meteors in the sky and move without any regular pattern. Sometimes they can be attracted by large meteors. However, these meteorites may have been hit by other meteors, causing them to fall after being agitated in the air. At the same time, they rub against the atmosphere in the air, so a very loud noise is heard. The meteorites are oddly black in color and have no luster and are uneven. Compared to ordinary rocks, the specific gravity is about equal to three. Academia Sinica plans to cut these meteorites into thin slices or grind them into fine powder for detailed and in-depth study so that they can understand their construction. It is also reported that meteorites have been found in Hangzhou and Anhui. The academy will continue to send people to investigate, conduct further research, and compile a systematic report for researchers' reference. (Special Telegram, 8th)</p>

<h3>An Official of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission on the Opinions of the Department of Border Affairs</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) An official of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission said that the system of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission is not good, and the intention to change it to the Department of Border Affairs is sincere. I have found that the biggest drawback of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission is that its internal organization is not centered on political affairs, but on various boundaries. The establishment of Mongolian and Tibetan affairs offices not only provides a target for the old and new factions of the Mongolian and Tibetan ethnic groups to compete for power, but also causes traces of ethnic division, which is very inappropriate. When changing to a department, this pattern should be eliminated. The Central Government should set up the Department of Border Affairs to handle border affairs, and it should not contain ethnic boundaries or border concepts. In particular, border affairs should be regarded as an integral part of the Central Government's political issues, and should include all ethnic groups in the Northwest and Southwest, not only handle Mongolian and Tibetan affairs, which is not helpful to the reality. Based on this reason, the internal organization of the Department of Border Affairs should be completely centered on political affairs, and various divisions should be established to handle border areas' religion, politics, industry, transportation, education, land, and other work, without having to divide them into Mongolian, Tibetan, Manchu, and Hui divisions, so as to avoid ethnic concepts from becoming increasingly visible.

<h3>Japanese Military Representative Okamura Arrives in Beiping: Tasked with Resolving War Zone Issues with Huang and He; Agreement Reached on Railway and Postal Service, Establishment of Customs at the Great Wall Passes; Okamura States Results Are Extremely Satisfactory</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Regarding the issues of receiving the Great Wall passes, restoring railway service on the Beining Line, establishing customs for tax collection, and restoring postal service, the Japanese side believes that these are local matters and should be negotiated by the Japanese Kwantung Army with our side. On the Japanese Kwantung Army side, Military Attaché Shibayama of the Japanese Embassy is responsible for liaising. After both sides consulted, it was decided to send a representative to Yuguan to negotiate. Shibayama was then summoned to Changchun by the Japanese Kwantung Army to report on the liaison situation. The views of the two sides are very close, and all principles are largely agreed upon. Shibayama returned to Beiping from the Northeast a few days ago and visited Huang Fu and He Yingqin to report on the views of the Kwantung Army. Huang and He were also understanding. The Kwantung Army then dispatched Deputy Chief of Staff Okamura Yasuji, along with Staff Officer Kita Seiichi, Secretary Hanawa, and Aide Izumi, to Beiping yesterday for formal discussions. They arrived at Nanyuan by plane at 11:25 AM on the morning of the 6th. Huang and He had previously sent military police to guard the Nanyuan airfield. Huang's representative, Yin Tong; He's representative, Zhu Shiqin; Police Chief Yu Jinghe; Japanese Embassy Military Attaché Shibayama; and Secretary Nakayama, along with twenty or so others, were present to welcome them. After disembarking, Okamura and others entered the city by car and stayed at the Fuso Hotel in Dongdan. The original plane flew back to Jinzhou at noon. At 2:30 PM in the afternoon, Okamura, accompanied by Shibayama, visited Huang Fu at the Foreign Affairs Building and then went to Jurentang at 3:30 PM to see He Yingqin. They first exchanged diplomatic pleasantries. Huang Fu hosted a banquet at the Foreign Affairs Building that evening. This morning (the 7th) at 10:00 AM, Okamura, Kita, and Shibayama returned to the Foreign Affairs Building and formally consulted with Huang and He, and formally passed principles on resolving various issues in the war zone. The consultation ended at around 11:00 AM. With the principles established, the details will be discussed at any time. It was decided that our side would receive the Great Wall passes, and the Japanese army would withdraw to the Great Wall line. However, because the Japanese barracks outside the passes have not yet been completed, the small number of Japanese troops temporarily stationed inside the passes will have to stay until next spring. After our side completes the receiving procedures, personnel can be sent to the passes for formal reception. Regarding the issue of restoring railway service on the Beining Line, our side is taking the non-recognition of the puppet state as a prerequisite, and the restoration of traffic is under conditions where it does not leave traces. Detailed methods will be discussed by the authorities of the Beining Railway Bureau and the puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau. Yin Tong, Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, and Xia Guangyu, representative of the Ministry of Railways, are currently in Beiping working on it and can be implemented in the near future. Both sides have largely agreed on the establishment of customs and tax collection at the Great Wall passes. Customs checkpoints will be established by both sides to collect transit taxes on goods entering and leaving. After the finance authorities dispatch personnel to conduct thorough investigations and planning, they will be established. Regarding the issue of restoring postal service, it was agreed that the puppet state's stamps cannot enter the customs, and a workaround will be used. Okamura is scheduled to visit Yu Xuezhong in Tianjin on the 10th to exchange views. On the 12th, the Japanese Kwantung Army will still send a plane to Tianjin to take him back to Changchun. Japanese ambassador Arima Setaro traveled to Tianjin by car at 7:00 AM this morning for some communication. He plans to return to Beiping within two or three days. Okamura said this afternoon, "I came here to discuss the issue of receiving the Great Wall passes. I paid respects to Chairman Huang and He yesterday, which was a visit in nature, and nothing was discussed. I formally met with Chairman Huang and He this morning. The results are extremely satisfactory, and there are no more problems. There is no need for further discussion. The Great Wall passes can be received at any time. As soon as China's preparations are complete, personnel can be dispatched. My task can be considered complete. This afternoon, I plan to visit Beihai and the Summer Palace. In the evening, I will attend Chairman He's banquet. I will visit various places of interest again tomorrow and leave for Tianjin on the 10th. After a short stay, I will return to Changchun."

<h3>Early Resolution Expected for the Bandit Situation in Luandong; Security Forces Attack Funing County; Li Jichun Telegrams Hebei Provincial Government to Resign</h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: Lao Haozi, a notorious bandit in Luandong, has occupied Funing County for more than a month. These bandits are groups of fifteen or so, temporarily gathered, and have no organization to speak of. If formal security forces were to be sent to suppress them, it would not be difficult to eliminate them in one fell swoop. However, the incident arose because there were many bandits, and the security forces stationed in the various counties of Luandong were weak and unable to resist. After agreeing with the Japanese side to send additional security forces to suppress the bandits, the Japanese side repeatedly used excuses to prevent the security forces from bringing heavy artillery into the recovered war zone. The security forces were stranded in Lutai and unable to advance. The situation has been going on for several weeks, so the bandit forces have spread further. By the time the security forces were able to advance into Luandong, the bandits had already occupied Funing County, making it difficult to attack. In addition, there was secret support from some party, making the matter even more difficult. Initially, the provincial government thought that if the bandits were willing to surrender, they would be pacified to avoid bloodshed during the siege, but the bandits remained ambiguous and never complied. Subsequently, Zhang Xiguang, the Commander of the Bandit Suppression, went to Yuguan to discuss with Endo on the Japanese side, who allowed the transport of mortars for the purpose of bombarding the city. Otherwise, with only rifles, the bandits would defend the city and there would be no hope of suppressing them. After the negotiations were completed, Zhang telegraphed the provincial government. The Chairman transferred security forces stationed in Yangcun and Jinghai to transport more than ten mortars and three cavalry units to suppress the bandits for the attack on the city. After arriving, they launched a fierce artillery attack on Funing County in the last two days, resulting in fierce fighting. It was reported that many bandits were killed in the South Gate. Due to the overwhelming force, there were rumors that the bandits would surrender and disarm on the fourth day. However, the bandits still used cunning tricks, taking advantage of the security forces' unpreparedness, and on the morning of the 4th, more than six hundred people emerged from the South Gate again, attempting to break through the security forces' defense line. Fortunately, it had been discovered beforehand, and the bandits' plan failed. Last night and this morning, the fighting at the front is still fierce. According to people who stayed at the rear camp today, there are only about two thousand bandits in Funing City. After this heavy suppression, it is thought that the situation can be resolved in a few days. However, when the security forces attacked the city, the bandits drove innocent civilians to the city walls to resist the artillery fire, forcing the security forces to stop the attack. At the same time, the Japanese side still hoped to pacify the bandits, but our authorities believe that providing money and disarming them is acceptable, but pacifying them is difficult. In short, the bandits in Luandong are seen as disguised troops from a certain party, so it is difficult to quell them. However, according to recent diplomatic trends, it may be resolved in the near future. As for Li Jichun, the Chairman of the Luandong Mixed Troops Reorganization Committee, has telegraphed the Beiping Military Branch and the Hebei Provincial Government, declaring his resignation and requesting the allocation of 115,000 yuan for reorganization expenses and local advances, which the provincial government has agreed to allocate. He will conclude his work in the near future. As for Li personally, although he outwardly claims that he plans to reside in Dalian after his resignation, he is still engaged in activities with the Japanese side and considers himself the overlord of Luandong. Regarding the two security units of Zhao Lei and Liu Zuo, which are affiliated to Li, the provincial government has decided to directly command them when Li resigns, so as to control military power.

According to Wang Xiantang, Director of the Library, the process of discovering the Han tombs and the recently purchased edict plate from the first year of Qin Shi Huang and the Qin Ge are very valuable. It is said that Qufu is the hometown of Confucius, with a long history, so ancient artifacts are discovered every year, which is highly valued by the world. Last month, continuous heavy rains caused the ground beside the road twelve miles east of the city to be flooded, revealing an ancient tomb. The tomb is a combined burial of two tombs, and the inside of the tomb is completely stone-carved images, which are extremely strange and ancient. The two tombs are separated by a stone wall, six or seven feet wide and more than ten feet long. On this stone wall, there are ten large characters engraved: "Mountains of Lu city East Anhan borough, Yu stone also". The characters are written in seal script, seven or eight inches square. The mountain character is drawn in double strokes. Judging from the font, it must be from the late Western Han Dynasty at the latest. According to the recent discovery of Han Dynasty stone carvings in Shandong, those with characters are very few. Occasionally, there are characters, mostly in small clerical script, and the large seal script characters with a diameter of one foot are considered to be the original creation. It is the most valuable among the Han stones discovered in Shandong in nearly a century. However, the meaning of the characters is ancient and obscure, and most of them are incomprehensible. "Mountains of Lu city East Anhan borough" may be the place name of the day, but it is also untraceable. "Yu" is the ancient character for "corner". Translating according to meaning, it may be that the mountain stones in the corner of the borough are the best, and the stonemason specially marked that the stone used was the mountain stone to show its value. However, it is still only a far-fetched interpretation, and further investigation is needed. After the discovery, it was reported to the county government. The county magistrate went to inspect it in person. The tomb was destroyed and nothing was left except for the stone carvings. Collectors took the opportunity to collect them. The county government ordered the land to be leveled and forbade rubbing and printing. The library is currently planning to transport the stones here for preservation to avoid loss. As for the edict plate from the first year of Qin Shi Huang, after Qin annexed the six kingdoms, the system of weights and measures was extremely chaotic, so an edict was issued to unify the system. The edict was made into a copper plate, placed on liters, pecks, and spoons, or cast on weights. This edict plate has the distinction between the first year of the edict and the twenty-sixth year of the edict, written by Li Si. It is said that the twenty-sixth year edition is the most valuable. Chen Fujia, a collector of antiquities in Weixian, Shandong, is famous at home and abroad for Mao Gong Ding, Wan Yin Shi Zhong, etc., most of which were sold by later generations. There are still the so-called ten edicts in the collection, including the edict plate ordered by Qin Shi Huang on Shengshao, which has recently been scattered and lost. Only one edict plate remains, three inches long and two inches wide, with a corner missing in the upper left corner. The characters are "The Prime Minister Si and Qu Ji made the measure and the law was exhausted by the First Emperor in the first year of his reign, and all had engraved words on them. If it is said that today, when the Emperor is to take over the throne and has his engraved title, the First Emperor, who has been ruling for a long time, shall take care of his descendants, so that they should not have cause to speak of success or outstanding virtue. Therefore, the edict is inscribed to the left, so that the mother should not doubt". (The original version is missing a corner, and the text is incomplete, so it is recorded from the ancient books.) This edict plate was unearthed in Chang'an. Liu Yanting's "Changan Obtains Ancient Manuscripts" and Chen Fujia's own "Fujia Jijing Record" both have records. In addition, there is a Jin Ge from the second year of Qin Shi Huang and a Zhou Ge, which are also fine products collected by Chen Fujia and are also valuable. The above-mentioned edict plate and two Ge are all purchased and preserved by the library. The recent calligraphy, painting, bronze and stone exhibition in Jinan was displayed with this for public viewing. (5th)</p>

<h3>First Battalion Deploys to Punan to Suppress Bandits</h3>
<p>The First Battalion of the Second Regiment of the Provincial Security Forces, stationed in Songjiang by order, has been here for two months. Commander Bai Jizhi of the battalion recently observed that banditry in the Punan area is rampant, leading to repeated robberies, and that security is especially important as winter approaches. Therefore, yesterday (the 7th) at 1:00 PM, he personally led the Third and Fourth Companies to patrol and suppress bandits in the Punan area to eliminate the source of the bandits. He is expected to return to Songjiang in about a week.</p>
<h3>Yu Family Robbery in Dongmen Results in Losses of Over 20,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>At the home of Yu Youqing, a wealthy man outside the East Gate, at around 6:00 PM last night (the 7th), the main gate was already closed when five thugs suddenly arrived, knocked on the gate, and forced a servant to lead them in. They first entered Yu Youqing's bedroom, pointed a gun at Yu Youqing's wife, Ms. Wu, and demanded to know the location of the safe. When told that the safe was kept in Shanghai, they went upstairs and attacked Yu Youqing's mother, Ms. Zhang, in her bedroom. Ms. Zhang knew they were robbers, kneeled and begged for mercy, but the thugs ordered the victims and their male and female servants to be locked in one room, and then wantonly searched, robbing a leather bag containing jewelry and about 700 yuan in cash. They re-entered Yu Youqing's bedroom. At that time, Yu Youqing was already lying in bed. One robber opened the bed curtains and was about to do something to Yu Youqing when another robber said that the person in bed was suffering from a mental illness and should not be disturbed. They also called the maid "Nanny," speaking in what sounded like a Pudong accent, as if they were very familiar with her. They also robbed a spring jewelry box in Yu Youqing's room and left through the main gate. After a while, the family reported the incident to the Fourth Police Station, which relayed it to the Public Security Bureau, which dispatched a large number of detectives to intercept them on various roads, searching all night, but without any trace. This morning, in the bamboo garden in North Yu Tang, villagers passing by spotted an old rattan basket and a small iron box. They later learned that they were the items stolen from the Yu family. The original items were returned. The small iron box was the jewelry box that had been stolen from Yu Youqing's bedroom. The lid of the box had been pried open, and the box could not be opened. It was abandoned on the ground, so the item was returned to its owner. The rattan basket contained a few letters and a set of broken clothes, which are believed to belong to the bandits. The Public Security Bureau has taken them back for investigation and has begun to search the various opium dens, but has found no clues. The Yu family has filed a loss report, estimating the losses at over 20,000 yuan, including three taels and three maces of gold leaf, a pearl-inlaid cornucopia pearl flower and more than 600 large and small pearls, one Xinhe pearl, and many jadeite inlays. It is said that the cornucopia is a family heirloom, and the victim is most grieved by its loss.</p>
<h3>County Government Meeting on Rent Collection Quality</h3>
<p>This year's rice harvest is slightly better than last year's. No famine reports have been sent to the county. The period for various industries to open their warehouses to collect rent is approaching. The county government checked the existing cases and convened a meeting at the county government on the 8th, attended by representatives from various districts, various industries, various charitable organizations, and the county party headquarters. County Magistrate Jin, the chairman, reported the purpose of the meeting. The representative from the Party Headquarters advocated setting the rent collection quality at 74% due to the decline of the rural economy this year. However, the various industry representatives argued that there were reports of famine last year, and the provincial committee surveyed and reduced it by 10%. There were no reports of famine this year, so some insisted on setting it at 79%. After a vote, the rent collection quality for this year was unanimously passed at 77%.</p>

<h3>Robbery and Serious Case in Song Xian Zhou Alley</h3>
<p>On the 7th, around 2 AM, four robbers broke into No. 10 Song Xian Zhou Alley inside Changmen. They first tied up the seven men and women in the house and then proceeded to search and loot until 5 AM when they fled with their stolen goods. The loss is estimated to be over a thousand yuan. Three suspects in the case have been detained by the authorities and are under investigation. The details are as follows: The house is inhabited by three families. One is Hu Zixian, who currently runs the Baofeng Fur Shop in front of the Tianku (he has a wife, Cao, and a son). Another is the family of Yao, who is deceased, leaving behind his wife, Chen, and a three-year-old daughter. The third is Tang, formerly an employee of the Shanghai Wuhua Bank, now unemployed. His father is currently the manager of the Xiangda Foreign Goods Store in the West Central Market. Tang lives with his concubine, Zhu, with whom he has a daughter. Excluding the children, there are a total of five men and women living in the house. Recently, Zhu's uncle, Zhu Xiangsheng, came to Suzhou from Shanghai and is staying in Tang's house. On the 6th, Hu Zixian stayed at the store. After nightfall, his wife and Yao Chen's family went to sleep early. At that time, Tang suddenly announced that he would take an early train to Shanghai to seek employment. He and his concubine整理箱件etc. prepared luggage, staying up all night. At 12 o'clock midnight, a rickshaw puller, Zhang Riyan, pulled his rickshaw to the door to wait. Tang thought it was still early and specifically opened the door to let him pull the rickshaw in and park it in the garden, then closed the front door. Around 2 AM on the 7th, there was a sudden, urgent knocking on the door. Without asking questions, Tang immediately went out and opened the door. As soon as he opened the door, four burly men wearing short blue cloth shirts and trousers, wearing felt hats, and speaking with a Jiangbei accent, rushed in, each holding a flashlight and hemp rope. One person stood at the door as a lookout. The other three robbers entered and first silenced the people in the house, then fired a shot in the living room with a gun-like object. They then tied the rickshaw puller to a tree. At the same time, they tied up the six men and women from the Hu, Yao, and Tang families in their respective rooms. Then, the three robbers turned over and searched the boxes and luggage in the three families' rooms one by one, taking all the valuables. It was not until 5:30 AM that they packed up and fled with the stolen goods. After the robbers left, Tang untied himself and then helped untie the others one by one. Hu's wife immediately went to the Baofeng Shop in front of the Tianku to report to her husband. Upon hearing the news, Hu Zixian immediately returned home to check the stolen items. He was about to report to the police station when Tang suddenly stopped him, saying that if he reported it, something serious might happen to his life. However, Hu eventually reported it. The detective team immediately sent detectives Wu Rongshan and Zhang Yunquan to investigate in detail. According to Hu Cao's and Yao Chen's statements, Tang knew the robbers because they had heard Tang call out the robbers' names: A'er, Jinbao, Xiaomazi, Zhuangjin, and so on. They also said that Tang himself did not return until 1 AM on the 6th and brought a rickshaw puller to stay at home, so the double doors were not closed properly. Also, during the robbery, one of the robbers said to Hu Cao, "You have 300 yuan in cash and two gold rings. You exchanged them yesterday. Where is the money hidden? Otherwise, we will kidnap your son and you will have to redeem him for 500 yuan." Detective Wu, based on Yao Chen's statements, believed that Tang, the rickshaw puller Zhang Riyan, and the related person Zhu Xiangsheng were highly suspicious. They were immediately detained. Tang and the other two were sent to the General Bureau yesterday (the 8th) for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Implementation of Import Tax on Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>Local gentry Li Yinquan and Zhang Yilin previously telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, requesting the early collection of import taxes on foreign rice in order to relieve the rural economy. Yesterday, they received a reply telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, stating: "Your telegram has been read. The collection of import taxes on foreign rice has been recommended by the Food Conference. I will telegraph the central government to implement it as soon as possible. I am replying accordingly."</p>
<h3>Lake Bandits Discovered in Paotai Wan and Xukou</h3>
<p>For the past ten days, lake bandits have been discovered in the Taihu Lake area, such as East Taihu, Dongting, and Xishan. The Third District of the Water Police has dispatched teams to encircle and suppress them. Yesterday (the 8th), news came that two bandit ships carrying more than twenty bandits were discovered in the Paotai Wan area near Pingwang. More than thirty bandits with complete firearms were also discovered near Xukou, planning to harass villages. The Seventh Team of the Water Police stationed there has dispatched師船to pursue and suppress them nearby.</p>

<h3>Discussion of Conversion Methods for Measuring Instruments</h3>
<p>The county government's case to promote the new system of weights and measures has repeatedly issued orders to various industries, setting a deadline for conversion. However, the rice, bean, and grain industries are fundamentally different in nature from other industries. Not only are the procedures troublesome, but there are also many obstacles, making it difficult to implement. The important reasons are related to loans for mortgages from banks, money houses, and堆棧, as well as various fees for storage rent, train freight, boat fares, and barge縫包. Although various items can be converted, the rice industry is difficult to resolve. The county government specifically invited representatives from relevant industries to hold a meeting yesterday, chaired by Zhang Fulin. The representative of the儲棧industry, Cai Jian San, was unable to attend due to matters. The rent and usage fees of the棧厫of the industry were previously calculated using Cao斛and漕秤. The ratio of the new measuring instrument to the old斛is 93.3%, and the ratio of the new衡器to the old秤is 85.5%. If this is not resolved, the rice industry will suffer a significant loss in expenses. The discussion resulted in that after the implementation of the rice, bean, and grain industries, the other industries will not have any problems. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu plans to contact the 儲棧industry at a certain time to unify it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Dismissed Policeman Arrested for Forging Official Seals</h3>
<p>Li Xiangtao from Huai'an, about twenty years old, used to work as a policeman in various public security sub-bureaus in this county. Due to his corrupt behavior, he was dismissed. After losing his job, Li lived in Meng Zhaoxiang's house at No. 175 Nancangmen. Also, Meng used to work as a policeman in the Second Sub-bureau with Li, so they were acquainted. Recently, Zhou Erkai, the Chief Prosecutor of the County Court, discovered that Li was forging court seals outside to defraud and extort. Therefore, at around 7 AM yesterday, he dispatched two prosecutors, Shen and Ren, leading通班法警, to search in separate directions. Prosecutor Ren led the police to search the home of Zhang Jinpei, a small vendor in Ping'anli, Dongxin Road, but found nothing. Prosecutor Shen led the police to search Meng Zhaoxiang's house in Nancangmen for over two hours but also found no evidence. Shen then ordered the police to take Meng Zhaoxiang to the court. At the same time, Prosecutor Ren had also ordered the police to take Zhang Jinpei and Zhang Ding to the court. After the joint trial by Prosecutor Shen, the result was to order Zhang Jinpei to be dismissed, Zhang Ding and Meng Zhaoxiang released on bail temporarily, and immediately find Li Xiangtao to bring him to justice. After Meng posted bail, he found Li Xiangtao in the Datong Hotel on Tongyun Road, brought him to the court, and Prosecutor Shen opened the trial again. An order was given to detain Li Xiangtao pending review.</p>

<h3>Deadline Set for Collecting 800,000 in Land Tax</h3>
<p>The number of 통邑residents who owe land tax is extremely high. On the 7th, the county government specifically held a collection meeting. It was decided that within three months, the land tax director would be responsible for collecting 400,000 yuan each of new and old taxes.</p>

<h3>Jiashan and Jiaxing Counties Appeal for Tax Reduction</h3>
<p>The Jiaxing County Farmers' Association, the county party headquarters, the Jiangsu Farmers' Association, and citizens Wang Wenhan et al., totaling twenty people, have successively telegraphed the National Government and the Provincial Department of Finance, unanimously appealing for a reduction or exemption of land tax surcharges. The general idea is that reducing land tax is a necessary condition for the prosperity of rural areas. The surcharges on land tax in this province are extremely high. For example, the military special donation has now been changed to a construction special donation, with an additional one yuan per tael per shih. After the addition of two yuan per shih to the Jiangsu provincial漕糧, it was only collected for one year, but now it continues unabated. Not only does it not comply with the Ministry of Finance's measures to regulate land tax surcharges, but the arrears affect the national treasury, and detention and seizure are enough to cause significant changes.</p>

<h3>Two Suicides Due to Economic Oppression</h3>
<p>Lu Asi, a peddler from Shaoxing, aged fifty-eight, at No. 5 Yunxi Alley, Shangtianzhu, West Lake, relies on the income from the spring incense season every year to make a living. This year, due to the weak spring incense, his income was short, and his livelihood was difficult. Recently, his pawns have been exhausted, and debts have piled up, unable to repay them. Yesterday (the 6th), he suddenly had a pessimistic thought and hanged himself in his closed house around 6 PM. His wife discovered it, but it was too late to save him. She reported it to the police station, which forwarded it to the court for inspection and coffin burial. Also, Liu Zhang, the proprietress of the Gonghe Village Hotel on Wushan Road, Hangzhou, has been suffering from poor business and heavy losses. It was difficult to pay the bills to various suppliers. Yesterday afternoon at 6 PM, she secretly went to Hongfu Bridge and jumped into the water to commit suicide. Fortunately, she was rescued by the patrolling police, detained at the police station, and interrogated to ascertain the reason. She was ordered to be released home.</p>
<h3>Early Opening Ceremony for Full Line of Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway</h3>
<p>The Jinyu section of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway was originally scheduled to hold a full-line opening ceremony on New Year's Day of the 23rd year of the Republic and simultaneously hold an exhibition of products from the line in Jinhua, which attracted the attention of the outside world to the products along the railway. With the approval of the Construction Department, the cities and counties along the line were widely solicited for their products. Now, due to the rapid progress of the project, it has been decided to advance the full-line opening ceremony to December 25th of this year and open an exhibition of products along the line. The railway has specially established a preparatory committee and sent personnel to various places to collect items.</p>

In the afternoon, he crossed the Baiguan River. County Magistrate Tang went to greet him and took a special train on the Cao-Shao Road, passing through Donghu. Because the place is a famous scenic spot in Yuezhong, the train stopped for a week's tour. It did not arrive in Shaoxing until about 3 PM. He got off at Wuyun Station. Those who came with him were Lu's adjutant and two attendants. County Magistrate Tang led Chairman Lu and others to take the prepared畫舫 to Yuling to visit famous scenic spots and historical sites and pay respects to the sage. Around 7 PM, they returned to Wuyun Station, took a car, and went from Beihai Bridge to Shangda Road Street, and then to the County Government. After a short rest, he inquired about the county's security and financial situation from the head of public security, Lai, and the head of finance, Zhang. Then, he took a chartered car to Shaoxing Station. At about 8 PM that night, the special train left for Xiao to return to the province.</p>

<h3>Chief Commissioner of Customs, Fetes Former Minister of Finance Song, Presents Silver Tripod, Gives Important Speech</h3>
<p>Chief Commissioner of Customs, Mr. Meyrick, hosted a banquet for former Minister of Finance Song Ziwen at his residence on Avenue Joffre yesterday, inviting dignitaries from the business and gentry circles to accompany him. During the banquet, Meyrick delivered a speech and, on behalf of the Customs colleagues, presented a silver tripod as a memento. Li Ming, Yu Qiaqing, Wang Xiaolai, and others then delivered speeches in succession. Finally, Mr. Song replied. The guests and hosts were delighted and the event ended. The various speeches are summarized below.</p>
<h3>Speech by Customs Commissioner Meyrick</h3>
<p>Dr. Song, distinguished guests, Dr. Song has served as Minister of Finance for six years. Now, he is retreating bravely and resolutely resigning. All of us in the Customs have been under his care for a long time. We cannot remain indifferent to his departure. However, in terms of Dr. Song's contributions to the country, we cannot help but admire him. In terms of Dr. Song's measures for the Customs, we are even more grateful. Recalling Dr. Song's tenure, he served during a time of global economic panic and depletion of domestic financial resources, coupled with the arrival of internal and external troubles. The difficulty of the environment can be imagined. Relying on Dr. Song's ability to shoulder the heavy burden, he rectified the national economy on one hand and focused on people's livelihood on the other. All his measures are comparable to those of financial experts around the world. It is fitting that his envoys were praised throughout Europe and the United States. Future historians will record his name for posterity. The Customs is an agency directly under the Ministry of Finance, and Dr. Song's policy towards the Customs is especially respected and remembered by all of us in the Customs. Now, I will list the most important ones as follows: Customs revenue is related to the credibility of various debts and reparations, and whether the credibility is solid depends on whether there are any changes in the current organization of the Customs. Dr. Song insightfully recognized this and followed the principle of retaining the old traditions to promote the progress of Customs administration. Therefore, the country's domestic and foreign credibility has become increasingly solid, and the belief of Chinese and foreign merchants in the Customs has become increasingly deep. Without Dr. Song's farsightedness, how could this have been achieved? This is one point. China has been plagued by internal wars and local unrest for several years. Customs administration has often been affected, even undermining the unity of Customs administration. Relying on Dr. Song's adaptation to the situation, he was able to support the precarious situation and achieve initial success. For example, the implementation of customs autonomy and the revision of the Customs tariff have opened a new era for Chinese Customs. In terms of tax revenue, the tax revenue in the 17th year of the Republic was only 128,270,000 yuan, and now it has increased to more than 348,480,000 yuan. In this eventful period for the country, not only was it able to recover the sovereignty of customs duties, but it was also able to increase the revenue of the national treasury. The greatness of its achievements is unparalleled. This is the second point. The treatment of Chinese Customs officers has always been inferior to that of foreign officers. This situation is not only unfair but also has an impact on work efficiency. In the 18th year, Dr. Song supervised former Director Zhang and Lehe to improve the treatment of Chinese officers and improve their status. As a result, the number of Chinese officers who hold important positions has gradually increased, and Chinese and foreign personnel have a spirit of harmony and cooperation, which has resulted in a synergy that is of great benefit to Customs administration. This is the third point. Previously, the Chinese government was somewhat separated from Customs administration. Since Dr. Song took office, he has thoroughly reformed it. Therefore, since then, all Customs administration has been handled in accordance with the deployments and orders, which is no different from other Chinese agencies. China's sovereignty over Customs has been completely restored. This is the fourth point. Since the increase in customs duties, smuggling has become increasingly rampant. The anti-smuggling task has become the most important task of the Customs. However, the Chinese coast has Dalian in the north, Taiwan in the east, and Hong Kong, Macau, and Guangzhou Bay in the south, all of which are sources of smuggled goods. The Customs is facing extreme difficulties in handling anti-smuggling affairs. Relying on Dr. Song's insight into this situation, all facilities and funds for anti-smuggling were readily approved whenever Lehe made a request. As a result, the organization of various anti-smuggling departments has gradually expanded internally, and various maritime巡輪have been added externally. Therefore, the current anti-smuggling equipment has gradually become complete, and the effectiveness has been significant. This is all due to Dr. Song's effective supervision. This is the fifth point. Looking at Dr. Song's past achievements, it can be said that he has made great contributions to the country and benefited the people. Now, he has retired successfully, which is deeply regretted by both the government and the public. Fortunately, I heard that Dr. Song has agreed to continue to serve as a member of the Standing Committee of the National Economic Council. He will apply his experience and knowledge in finance to controlled economics, and the benefits he will bring to the people are immeasurable. The joy is beyond words. Fortunately, Dr. Kong has succeeded as Minister. All of us in the Customs welcome him. I hope he will use his great strategy to save the world and express his grand plan to enrich the country. The future of the Party and the country will depend on him. As for the Customs, if he can understand the actual situation, maintain the current organization, attach importance to national credit, and benefit Customs administration, then we will be fortunate. Now, on behalf of all the Customs personnel, I am pleased to present Dr. Song with a silver tripod as a memorial and to express my admiration. I wish Dr. Song and Dr. Kong good health.</p>
<h3>Li Ming's Speech</h3>
<p>Today, the Chief Commissioner of Customs and the Customs colleagues are presenting a souvenir to Minister Song in honor of his departure from the ministry, and inviting us to participate and gather together. I am very happy. At this critical juncture in the overall national situation, Minister Song suddenly left his post. It is certainly wise for Minister Song to rest temporarily after years of hard work, but the people cannot help but regret it. I would like to represent the Banking Association and the Foundation Committee to say a few words about my feelings. Minister Song has been in charge of finance for several years, and his achievements are great and brilliant, and they are obvious to all. Commissioner Meyrick has already said enough to represent general public opinion. However, in my opinion, Minister Song's achievements during his tenure are particularly great in three respects, and they occupy an extremely important position in the history of Chinese finance, so I must mention them. First, the abolition of Likin. Likin has been a major scourge for hundreds of years. The motion to abolish it has been around for decades, but it has never been done. Minister Song accomplished it with one hand, overcoming all difficulties with his perseverance, eliminating the ills of the finance of a hundred years and relieving the merchants and people from immeasurable suffering. Second, customs autonomy. This matter has been brewing for several years and is related to diplomacy, similar to pending cases. Minister Song also spent a lot of effort to solve the first step of customs autonomy. From then on, national tax revenue was increased, which had a major impact on industry and commerce. Third, the abolition of taels and the reform of yuan. The currency of our country has always been inconvenient in all aspects because both silver taels and silver yuan are in circulation at the same time. The proposal to abolish taels has also been around for decades, but it has never been achieved. This year, after careful deliberation by Minister Song, he resolutely abolished taels and reformed the yuan, and the currency has a unified foundation, benefiting industry and commerce immeasurably. The above three are the most prominent and significant aspects of Minister Song's achievements during his tenure. In addition, there are other important matters. Minister Song has made every effort to maintain national credit and has taken into account both domestic and foreign debts for many years, which is seen by both Chinese and foreigners. However, the source of maintaining credit relies entirely on customs tax revenue, and this cannot but be attributed to Chief Commissioner Meyrick's conscientious performance of his duties and effective guidance. We believe that although Minister Song has now left his ministry, Chief Commissioner Meyrick is still in charge of taxation. We sincerely hope that the Customs tax revenue will continue to improve in the future, maintain a perfect system, and provide sufficient tax revenue to make the credit increasingly stable. The new Minister Kong has always been of the same mind as Minister Song and has known us well. At this time, he will certainly continue to take raising national credit as a prerequisite, and Chief Commissioner Meyrick will also be able to continue to guide him, complementing each other.</p>
<h3>Former Minister Song's Reply</h3>
<p>Today, I am honored to receive a souvenir from the Customs officers and to receive so much praise from Chief Commissioner Meyrick. I am really ashamed and grateful. Recalling that during my tenure as Minister of Finance, the Customs has achieved a lot. Customs tax revenue has increased three times from before after customs autonomy. The service personnel are all able to be faithful to the public and do not tarnish their past reputation. The Customs administration has also been able to maintain its inherent integrity. I am very fortunate for this. Now that I have left the Ministry of Finance, there are some misunderstandings about the status of the Customs in the outside world. At this time, I will briefly discuss it with you. After the Northern Expedition was completed, the National Government established its capital in Nanjing. At that time, there were many criticisms of the Customs from both the government and the public. Some said that the Chinese Customs was like a government within a government, no less than an appendage of the foreign powers' embassies in China. Some even said that the words of the Chief Commissioner of Customs were as effective as the laws of the Ministry of Finance, and that the fate of the Finance Minister of the Beijing government was in the hands of the Chief Commissioner of Customs, and that the Customs revenue was entirely deposited in foreign banks, which made their power in China increasingly strong, and Chinese banks were left out in the cold, and that the appointment of senior Customs officials was limited to foreign Customs officers. At that time, there was a unanimous call from the government and the public to thoroughly improve the organization of the Customs. However, at that time, according to my observation, the involvement of the Customs in the political vortex had nothing to do with its own organization. The internal organization of the Customs was very sound. The points of criticism from the outside world could be corrected without shaking its organization. I am very fortunate that the above observations have been proven by facts to be correct. Today, the position of the Chief Commissioner of Customs is already a loyal servant of the government, completely obedient to the Minister of Finance. The raising of national funds is entirely the responsibility of the Minister of Finance and has nothing to do with the Commissioner of Customs. The storage of tax revenues is now entirely concentrated in national banks. The promotion and transfer of Customs officers is now entirely based on service performance and has nothing to do with nationality. Foreign Customs officers, except for a few specialized technical personnel, are no longer recruited. And the treatment of all current foreign Customs officers is still based on fairness. Customs personnel, from Mr. Meyrick down, have all made efforts to implement the above improvements. You should feel that the people's faith and goodwill towards the Customs and Commerce have been improving with the times, and the purpose of the Customs is to become a non-partisan Chinese agency. The service rules for Customs public officials are very good in my opinion, and I want all the departments of the Ministry of Finance to follow suit. During my tenure as Minister of Finance, I often encouraged the members of the Ministry to be loyal to the government, not just to one person or group. Otherwise, the change of the Minister would affect the Ministry's affairs. Therefore, when I retired this time, I encouraged all the subordinates, except for the secretaries and attendants, to continue to work as usual, unless the new Minister had other candidates. This is because public officials take loyalty to the government as a prerequisite. In my opinion, we should not affect the overall situation with the progress or retreat of individuals. Fortunately, my retirement this time did not cause any disorder in finance. Otherwise, I would not have fulfilled my duty to the government. I have served as Minister of Finance for a short time and have made few contributions. However, I have always encouraged myself and my colleagues with the words "be loyal to the government and be loyal to what you do." Customs officers can be regarded as examples. Therefore, the progress of Customs can only improve with the times. This is all I want to say. I thank you for the gifts and the spirit of cooperation that has always been there. You will certainly continue to maintain this spirit towards the new Minister. I have great expectations.</p>

<h3>The Chinese Merchants' Yarn and Cloth Exchange Resumes Cotton Yarn Auctions Today; Zou Bingwen and Others Return to Shanghai Yesterday After Petitioning in Beijing; Rejection of New Yarn to Be Remedied with Alternative Measures; Exchange and Brokers Held Meetings Yesterday to Report Progress</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, following the Ministry of Industry's order to the Chinese Merchants' Yarn and Cloth Exchange to reject new yarn from manufacturers from November to the end of December of this year, due to opposition from brokers who requested the revocation of the order, cotton yarn auctions were temporarily suspended for three days starting on the 6th of this month. Zou Bingwen, a standing committee member of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, and Mu Jiechu, chairman of the Exchange's board of directors, traveled to Beijing to negotiate, and returned to Shanghai yesterday. A decision was made on alternative measures, and it was decided that auctions would resume as usual today. The Cotton Yarn Exchange held a board meeting yesterday, and the brokers held a general meeting to report on the progress. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Zou Bingwen and Others Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>After the brokers petitioned for the revocation of the order to reject new yarn from manufacturers, Zou Bingwen, a standing committee member of the National Economic Committee's Cotton Industry Control Committee, and Mu Jiechu, chairman of the Chinese Merchants' Yarn and Cloth Exchange, traveled to Beijing on the 6th to negotiate with Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry. They returned to Shanghai from Beijing the night before last. Yesterday morning, Mu Jiechu, Zou Bingwen, and others convened a meeting at the Cotton Industry Control Committee, deciding to comply with the Ministry of Industry's order and to remedy the brokers' request for revocation with alternative measures.</p>
<h3>Exchange Board Meeting</h3>
<p>The Chinese Merchants' Yarn and Cloth Exchange held a special board meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Attendees included Mu Jiechu, Ye Zhuotang, Li Fuxun, Lin Kanghou, Gu Zipan, Wu Zhongchi, and others. Chairman Mu Jiechu reported on the progress of Zou Bingwen and others' negotiation with Chen Gongbo, the Minister of Industry. A decision was made on alternative measures for rejecting new yarn delivered by manufacturers from November to the end of December. It was resolved that cotton yarn auctions would resume on November 9th. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. After the meeting, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Mu Jiechu, who stated that a decision had been made to resume cotton yarn auctions as usual starting on the 9th. Alternative measures for rejecting new yarn had been decided, and there were no major issues. However, the details of the measures would be announced after the auctions resumed.</p>
<h3>Brokers Hold General Meeting</h3>
<p>The Chinese Merchants' Yarn and Cloth Exchange Brokers' Association held a general meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday. Fifty-three brokers attended, chaired by Zhu Guangcheng, who reported on the alternative measures for rejecting new yarn from manufacturers from November to the end of December. A resolution was unanimously passed, and the meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM. After the meeting, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Zhu Guangcheng, who stated that the brokers' request for revocation was due to practical difficulties. As for the so-called alternative measures, they were to remedy these difficulties. Now that the difficulties have been remedied, there are no problems.</p>
<h3>Notice of Resumption of Auctions</h3>
<p>The Yarn and Cloth Exchange issued two notices at 6:00 PM yesterday, which are transcribed below: (1) Cotton yarn auctions will resume as usual starting on the morning of the 9th of this month. This is announced in addition to notifying the Brokers' Association. (2) For both buyers and sellers of cotton yarn for November and December of this year, a special margin of 22 yuan in cash will be added per bale, starting on the morning of the 9th of this month. This is announced in addition to notifying the Brokers' Association.</p>
<h3>Details of Alternative Measures</h3>
<p>The Cotton Industry Control Committee petitioned the Ministry of Industry to order the Chinese Merchants' Yarn and Cloth Exchange to reject new yarn delivered by manufacturers from November to the end of December in order to fundamentally remedy the sharp decline in the price of Chinese yarn. The brokers' request for revocation was because customers had already entered into contracts for new yarn that had been traded, and failure to fulfill these contracts would inevitably cause difficulties. As for the decided alternative measures, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency learned from various sources that since the Ministry of Industry's order had been issued, revocation would affect the government's credibility. However, the brokers' practical difficulties were real. Therefore, it was decided that when cotton yarn auctions resume from November to the end of December, the Cotton Industry Control Committee will exchange the new yarn rejected by the Exchange in accordance with the Ministry of Industry's order with existing yarn.</p>
<h3>Purchasing Yarn for Sale in Other Ports</h3>
<p>There have been many rumors about the Cotton Industry Control Committee's petition to the Ministry of Industry to restrict the business of the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, and some have accused the Committee of engaging in speculation because the Committee recently purchased 24,000 bales of cotton yarn from the market in order to raise yarn prices. However, Chen Guangfu, the chairman of the Cotton Industry Control Committee, told a reporter from the China Eastern News Agency yesterday that the rumors circulating outside were not worth the attention of those in the know. The Cotton Industry Control Committee's purchase of the cotton yarn was purely to raise yarn prices. Although it will still need to be sold to other places in the future, it will definitely not be sold in this city. The Committee will determine the needs of various places in other provinces and sell it there, so as not to affect the market price of cotton yarn, he said.</p>

<h3>Combined Land and Sea Transport on the Longhai Railway to Officially Commence Operations on the 15th; First Voyage to Lao Yao Set for the 19th; More Daily Sailings on the Qinghai Section</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's combined land and sea transport on the Longhai Railway is scheduled to commence on the 15th of this month, and the first vessel to depart from Shanghai to Lao Yao is scheduled to set sail on the 19th of this month. Zhou Songnian, the section chief specially dispatched to Shanghai by the Railway Bureau, signed the contract with the Kang Zhenji Barge Company yesterday and left Shanghai for Zhengzhou that evening. All the procedures have been completed. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Railway Bureau Representatives Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has specially established a dedicated section to handle the combined land and sea transport on the Longhai Railway. The Railway Bureau has also appointed eight representatives to come to Shanghai to cooperate in the operation, and has appointed Chen Shouchi as the resident director in Shanghai. Mr. Chen has already arrived in Shanghai and joined the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's combined transport section to handle matters. The remaining eight representatives are scheduled to arrive at the Bureau on the 15th of this month. Chen Shouchi and Zhou Fengtu are currently discussing and assigning the responsibilities of each person.</p>
<h3>Tonghua to Sail First Voyage</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Zhou Songnian of the Railway Bureau agreed that the first vessel from Shanghai to Lao Yao, Haizhou, will be the Tonghua, scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the 19th of this month to begin transporting Northwest combined transport cargo. On the 21st, it will return to Shanghai fully loaded with goods from the railway. This vessel will be the first Shanghai merchant ship to sail to Lianyungang. If there is more cargo in the future, additional sailings will be added.</p>
<h3>Products from Various Ports Along the Longhai Railway</h3>
<p>The Longhai Railway runs through four provinces, and the output along the route is large. Once combined transport is implemented, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's business on this route will increase tenfold compared to before. According to the results of a survey conducted by the Railway Bureau, the goods produced on all the main and branch lines of the railway include: 500 train cars and 139,000 tons of wheat, 360,000 bags of flour, 36,000 tons of sorghum, 35,000 tons of beans, over 80,000 tons of raw peanuts, 1,000 tons of raw oil, over 5,000 tons of fruit, 4,530 tons of melon seeds, 2,000 tons of yellow vegetables, 18,000 tons of miscellaneous grains, 110,000 tons of salt, over 300 tons of eggs, 50,000 bales and 25,000 tons of cotton and yarn, 3,000 tons of timber, 200,000 tons of coal, 100,000 tons of limestone, 3,000 tons of medicinal materials, 3,000 tons of bean cake, 2,000 tons of wine, 200 tons of cattle and sheep hides, and over 20,000 tons of miscellaneous goods, totaling 787,030 tons, 50,000 bales, and 500 train cars.</p>
<h3>Qinghai Still Has Daily Sailings</h3>
<p>There is also a lot of freight traffic between Haizhou and Qingdao, and the coastal ports along the route include Gongkou, Taokou, Lankou, Zhewang, Qingkou, and Xiangshuikou. Currently, the companies operating on this route include Changji, Yingshuo, Yutai, Fuluo, and Nakamuragumi, with a total of over twenty vessels. Among them, the Japanese company Nakamuragumi has the largest business, with over ten vessels, and has been excessively lowering freight rates in an attempt to monopolize the market. After the combined transport between the Longhai and Jiaoji Railways, the shipping line on this Qinghai section should also be operated by state-owned vessels. However, there is still resistance, so the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is still in the process of handling this matter.</p>
<h3>Current Locations of Noteworthy People</h3>
<p>Liu Chongjie, the ambassador to Germany, left Beijing on the night express train last night and is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning. He will stay for a few days before departing overseas.</p>

<h3>Dong Kang Crossed to Japan Yesterday Morning to Lecture; Also Entrusted by the Ministry of Education to Investigate Japanese Cultural Enterprises</h3>
<p>Mr. Dong Kang, a legal scholar, was invited by Waseda University, Meiji University, and the Chinese Legal System Research Association of the Japanese Empire to go to Tokyo to lecture on ancient Chinese legal systems. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to Mr. Dong's residence on Seymour Road yesterday morning to inquire. At that time, Mr. Dong and his secretaries, Sun Yizhai and Yang Wuyi, were getting into a car to go to Yangshupu to board the Shanghai Maru. Mr. Dong's relatives and friends went to the dock to see him off. The ship left Shanghai at 9:30 AM. Before leaving, Mr. Dong told the reporter that the lecture trip was originally scheduled for two months, and the stay would not be extended to more than early March next year, when he would return immediately. In addition to lecturing on Chinese law, he was also entrusted by the Ministry of Education, along with Mr. Yuan Tongli, the deputy director of the Beiping Library, to jointly investigate Japanese education, libraries, and other cultural enterprises for the benefit of China.</p>
<h3>Ya Qingqi, the Duke of the Right Wing of Qinghai, Arrived in Shanghai from Beijing Yesterday; To Visit Various Schools and Industrial and Commercial Conditions; Prepared to Return to Qinghai to Construct Various New Enterprises</h3>
<p>Ya Qingqi, the Duke of the Right Wing of Qinghai and the head of the Torsak banner, recently went to Beijing from Qinghai to pay respects to important figures in the central government and report on the latest political and social conditions in Qing Province. Mr. Ya is a leader of the youth faction in Qinghai and has long aspired to develop the Northwest. He came to Shanghai from Beijing the day before yesterday to visit the various schools and industrial and commercial conditions in the city. A reporter from the People's Words News Agency met with Mr. Ya at his residence yesterday. According to him, Qinghai has a vast territory and is extremely rich in mineral and forest resources, making it the only treasure in the Northwest of China. However, due to traffic congestion, the situation in the interior is very isolated. The progress of education and industry and commerce in the advanced provinces and cities cannot be transmitted to Qing Province. Recently, the Qinghai Travel Group, undeterred by hardships, traveled from Shanghai to Qinghai. The situation in our province will undoubtedly gain a deeper understanding from the Chinese people. However, because travel is too difficult, it is not easy for people from other provinces to leave their hometowns and travel to remote areas for a while. Therefore, I have come to Beijing and Shanghai to investigate and strive to return to Qinghai as soon as possible to apply the details obtained from the investigation of education and industry and commerce, taking into account local conditions, and strive to build enterprises. At the same time, I hope that talents from all over the country will not abandon our province and will provide instructions at any time. This is not only my good fortune, but also the good fortune of the country.</p>
<h3>The Flagship of the United States Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, Will Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Evening Post reports that the USS Augusta, the newly dispatched flagship of the United States Asiatic Fleet, is coming from the west coast of the United States and was originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on Friday. It is now believed that it will arrive earlier. Rear Admiral Hepburn, the Commander-in-Chief of the United States Asiatic Fleet, will move aboard the ship after its arrival and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai with United States Minister Johnson on the 18th of this month to visit various ports in South China. Then, the American Minister will return north from Hong Kong, and Admiral Hepburn will return south to the Philippines. The flagship yacht USS Isabel will also return to the Philippines. The USS Augusta, although similar to the original flagship USS Houston as a 10,000-ton cruiser, is newly built and has the latest designs. Therefore, it is being dispatched to replace the USS Houston to strengthen the fleet. The USS Houston is expected to leave Shanghai around the 17th of this month to return to the United States.</p>
<h3>Anti-Banditry Movement; Day Three of Propaganda Week; Over Four Hundred Representatives from Eighty-Plus Groups Attended</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the third day of the Anti-Banditry Movement Week, the "Workers and Peasants' Anti-Banditry Propaganda Day." The Xiaoximen Juvenile Propaganda Group convened a propaganda campaign for workers and peasants' groups at 2:00 PM. The attendees included Zhu Xuefan, Zhou Xuexiang, Li Mengnan (from the General Labor Union), Yu Zhenhui, Zhang Huijun (from the Municipal Farmers' Association), Zhou Funong from the Municipal Party Headquarters, and representatives from over eighty groups including the Knitting Industry Union, the Silk Weaving Industry Union, the Cigarette Industry Union, the Soap and Medicine Industry Union, the Rubber Industry Union, the Jiangwan District Farmers' Association, the Fifth District Paper Industry Union, the Laundry Union, the Huna District Farmers' Association, the Gaohang District Farmers' Association, the Seventh District Party Headquarters, the Fifth District Party Headquarters, the Yangjing District Farmers' Association, the Medicine Industry Union, the Fifth District Match Industry Union, the First District Water and Electricity Industry Industrial Union, the Dried Goods Union, and the Postal Workers' Union, totaling approximately four hundred people. In addition to the police officers dispatched by the Public Security Bureau for protection, there were also twelve Boy Scouts from the Shanghai-Ningbo Steamboat Cabin Attendants' Union to maintain order. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>General Assembly Order</h3>
<p>(1) Ringing the bell to start the meeting; (2) Singing the Party song; (3) Paying the highest respect to the Party flag, the national flag, and the portrait of the President; (4) The Chairman reading the President's will; (5) Silence; (6) Chairman's report; (7) Speeches; (8) Shouting slogans; (9) Performances; (10) Adjournment.</p>
<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the rituals were completed, Zhu Xuefan gave a report, followed by a speech by Zhou Funong, a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, and then a speech by Lu Jingshi. The speeches are omitted.</p>
<h3>Artistic Performances</h3>
<p>In order to thoroughly educate all sectors of society on the significance of anti-banditry and to increase interest, the General Labor Union specially invited the Postal Workers' Union to perform silk and bamboo music, martial arts, and magic, and requested the Juvenile Propaganda Group to perform a costumed performance. The audience was very moved by the various performances.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Propaganda</h3>
<p>Today is the "Business Community Anti-Banditry Propaganda Day." The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to convene a Business Community Anti-Banditry Propaganda Movement at 2:00 PM in the meeting hall of the Tianhougong Bridge. It has been decided that Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Lu Wenshao will serve as the presidium.</p>
<h3>The Business Community Solicits Donations for Disaster Relief in Pudong</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, Wang Xiaolai, the chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and committee members Du Yuesheng, Wang Yansong, and Lu Wenshao jointly invited the leaders of various trade associations to a tea party in the standing committee room of the Chamber of Commerce to discuss providing relief to the victims of the disaster in Pudong. Over a hundred representatives from ninety trade associations, including banks, money shops, new medicines, and silk, attended. Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, and others successively reported on the disaster situation in Pudong and the urgent need for relief. Everyone agreed that since other provinces have suffered disasters, Shanghai should collect a large sum of money and send it to Pudong, which is nearby. Seeing the impoverished people with their own eyes, they should do their best to help. It was decided that donation books would be distributed on the spot, and the representatives present would be asked to solicit donations from their respective trades and forward the collected funds immediately.</p>
<h3>The Economic Hardship of the Rural Areas in Pudong</h3>
<p>Pudong is located east of the Huangpu River, separated from Shanghai by only a river. It consists of the three counties of Fengxian, Nanhui, and Chuansha. Most of the residents live by farming. Every autumn, when the harvest matures, they sell rice and cotton to earn a living. In recent years, low grain prices have hurt farmers, and people have already felt the pain. Unexpectedly, this autumn, after suffering two typhoons, the crops were greatly damaged. In addition, continuous rain has washed away a lot of the cotton bolls. The harvest is less than one dan per mu. In previous years, each dan was worth twelve yuan, but this year it is less than ten yuan, and still no one cares. Farmers cannot sell their crops and look worried. It is hoped that the yarn mills in Shanghai will pay attention to this and make every effort to purchase the crops, so that the farmers' economy can be turned around, which will strengthen their purchasing power, and yarn and cloth will naturally be able to sell. If they are abandoned and only foreign cotton is valued, money will flow into the hands of foreigners and will never return. It is hoped that those who care about the rural areas will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>The Central Mint Resumed Operation Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Central Mint in Zigong had previously lost its effectiveness due to the accumulation of sand, which led to the interruption of the water source in the factory, and it was forced to temporarily suspend work for about a week. It is now learned that the factory has hired workers to excavate the sand for days and completed the work the day before yesterday. It resumed operation as usual yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Industry Has Consulted the Ministry of Finance on the Tariff on Dumping of Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously stated that the import of foreign rice has led to a decline in domestic rice prices, which has further deteriorated the rural economy. It requested the Ministries of Finance and Industry to implement tariffs on imported foreign rice as soon as possible in order to maintain the foundation of the country. It is now learned that the Ministry of Industry has replied yesterday. The original reply is as follows: "The telegram from the Eastern Representative has been read. We have consulted the Ministry of Finance to expedite the review and handling. You are hereby informed."</p>
<h3>The Method for Reducing the Grade of Domestic Matches Has Been Extended for Another Year; The Ministry of Railways Instructs the Railway Bureau to Comply</h3>
<p>The Two Railway Administration Bureau received instructions from the Ministry of Railways yesterday stating, "The China National Match Industry Association has submitted a report stating that the deadline for the method of reducing the grade of transportation for Chinese matches is approaching, and the Chinese match industry is still depressed. It has requested that the deadline be extended for another three years in order to provide relief and maintain the industry, etc. After reviewing the various points mentioned by the Association, they are still true. It should be approved to extend the deadline for another year from January 1, 1934, in order to maintain the industry. In addition to the approval, a copy of the original report is enclosed, and the Bureau is instructed to comply." After receiving the instructions, the Railway Bureau forwarded them to the Traffic Department for compliance.</p>
<h3>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association Sent a Letter to the Municipal Council, Asking It to Pay Attention to the Disguised Price Increase of Telephones</h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday stating, "Regarding the matter of Shanghai telephones proposing to increase prices again, we have previously sent a letter on October 16 requesting the Council to reject the request. Subsequently, we received letters from all walks of life expressing opposition to the price increase. We are pleased to learn that the Council has rejected the company's request. However, if the company still intends to change its approach and make another request, please firmly reject it again based on the contract and the contents of the company's letter requesting a price increase on August 15, 1930. Furthermore, judging from the current operating conditions of the company, there is no reason for a loss. There may be unreasonable items in its expenditures. It is difficult to understand the actual situation without a detailed examination of its accounts. However, this examination cannot be done by Mr. Ford, the Director of Finance of the Council. It is essential to find out the real situation in the slightest. If any unreasonable accounts are found, this is a direct problem with the patent contract and should be corrected. Even if we take a step back, even if a request for a price increase can be discussed in accordance with the contract in 1935, there will still be major problems. In addition to bearing reasonable costs, users should not and absolutely do not want to bear any unreasonable costs. We therefore request the Council to pay close attention to this matter and not allow the company to deceive or mislead. We are confident that the Council will maintain justice." This letter is addressed to the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession.</p>
<h3>The National Products Promotion Association is Responsible for Introducing Services at the Railway Business Office</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association led the Shanghai National Products Travel Group to Xuzhou to hold the Xuzhou National Products Exhibition. The products of various factories, 513 in total, were entrusted to the Railway Business Office for combined transport. Manager Shen Zouting of the office specially dispatched Mr. Wang Yulun to the association to discuss the arrangements and preside over the movement. The procedures were simple and the service was thoughtful. Not only were the transportation costs lower, but the transportation was also fast. The fast train departed on the evening of the 4th and arrived in Xuzhou on the morning of the 6th, allowing for a relaxed exhibition at the opening on the 8th, which gave participating factories great confidence. It is now learned that the association believes that the office is caring for national products, working very hard, and benefiting factories, which is not insignificant. Yesterday, the association specially notified its affiliated factory members to be responsible for introducing and promoting the business to show the intention of mutual assistance and cooperation. It also attached two printed materials from the office, one on the method of receiving and sending packages and the other on the method of receiving and sending goods, so that each factory could understand all the procedures.</p>
<h3>The National Exhibition Period on Foch Road Opens; Over Ninety Manufacturers Have Already Participated</h3>
<p>Since the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association leased the vacant lot next to the Guanghua Cinema on Foch Road as the site for the National Products Movement Exhibition, it has begun soliciting national products manufacturers to participate and has set tomorrow (the 10th) as the deadline for registration and the 15th for the opening. Because the construction of the 150 exhibition halls will take time and cannot be completed by then, a notice has been issued to postpone the opening. The companies that have registered to join include those in the electrical appliance industry, the silk industry, the parasol industry, the knitting industry, and the cosmetics industry, totaling over ninety companies. There are also companies in the hardware industry, the copper and iron bed industry, and the steel industry that have not yet joined the association. Since the above-mentioned national products are indispensable items in daily life, the association is specially soliciting participation from the trade associations of each industry to support the event and is extending the deadline by five days so that those who are prepared to participate but have not yet had time to do so will not have regrets. The opening of the exhibition will also be extended to the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Advancement Society Expands Its Organization and Solicits New Members</h3>
<p>Important figures in the city's industrial and commercial circles, in the spirit of mutual cooperation, have organized the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Advancement Society to study the improvement of industrial and commercial enterprises. Although the Society has only been established for one year, its achievements have been remarkable. It was learned yesterday that the Society held its eighth board meeting.

<h3>A Visit to the Huang's Livestock and Planting Farm</h3>
<p>Mr. Huang Yuezhou, a revolutionary predecessor from Fenghua, returned from his official career in the final years of the Qing Dynasty and purchased several acres of farmland in the Zhenru North area of the city, investing in developing a garden for livestock and planting. After decades of operation, it has now expanded to hundreds of acres and is a sight to behold. The reporter accepted Mr. Huang's invitation to visit, and the details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Garden Arrangement</h3>
<p>The Huang Family Livestock and Planting Farm is located about two miles north of Zhenru. Take the No. 3 public bus from the North Railway Station and get off at Southeast Medical College. Walk about a mile to reach it. The farm is surrounded by bamboo fences and planted with holly. Inside the farm, there are about sixty to seventy acres of farmland, and outside the farm, there are another forty to fifty acres, totaling over one hundred and dozens of acres. In the middle of the entrance, there are three thatched huts where the Huang family resides. The flowers and trees in the garden are arranged in an orderly manner. The trees are mainly woody plants, such as plum, pear, peach, osmanthus, maple, pine, and so on, totaling more than ten thousand plants. Orchids, chrysanthemums, peonies, etc., are also available in abundance. Several ponds are dug in the garden to raise fish. Rockeries and exotic bamboos are captivating. Among them, osmanthus, bamboo, and peonies have as many as fifty or sixty varieties, which is even more commendable and truly spectacular.</p>
<h3>Resisting Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>When Mr. Huang first started developing the land, he only had a few acres. Later, Japanese people in Shanghai engaged in horticulture, encroaching on the market. Mr. Huang, being a revolutionary veteran, felt distressed upon seeing this. Therefore, he used all his resources to expand and cultivate various exotic flowers and trees to compete with the Japanese, which proved to be surprisingly effective. Currently, many large flower gardens in various ports are ordering flowers and trees from Mr. Huang.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Takahashi Jiangxinsha Defense Corps</h3>
<p>Since the municipal government designated Takahashi Jiangxinsha Island as an oil depot area, major oil companies such as Guanghua, Asia, and Texaco have successively established oil depots and built factories on the island. As a result, the market has become lively, and the population has increased sharply. Local gentry and merchants, considering the police force to be weak and fearing that villains might take the opportunity to infiltrate and disrupt public order, initiated the organization of a defense corps for self-defense. It has already been approved by the Shanghai Municipal Defense Corps Management Committee. Yesterday, a founding ceremony was held. There are more than sixty members in the corps, fully equipped with firearms. The captain is Zhu Gongfu, and it is under the jurisdiction of the Takahashi District Defense Corps. Guests included Zhu Xiaoyan, Gu Danchao, Xu Yunlong, etc. After a speech by the head of the Takahashi District, Mr. Lan, Zhu Xiaoyan and others successively gave speeches, all encouraging the members to protect the local area and love the people, so as to fulfill their responsibilities.</p>

<h3>The Whole Story of the Tragic Murder of a Mother and Daughter in Lujiazhai, Pudong - Patrolman Zheng Wanming, Number Ten, is the Main Culprit - This Case is Definitely Not a Robbery, But a Revenge</h3>
<p>Hu Changming, a butcher from Funing, residing in Maoyeli, Lujiazhai, Pudong, was suddenly invaded by three thugs at about 10:00 pm on the first day of this month. They robbed him of 200 yuan in cash and several gold-plated jewelry items, and shot and killed Hu's wife, Madam Yu, and Hu's daughter, Xiuzhen, both. When Hu's wife was dying, she cried out, "The one who killed me is Number Ten!" Thereupon, the Public Security Bureau immediately identified this statement as a clue to the case. After days of searching by police and detectives, it was confirmed that the main culprit in this case was the patrolman known as Number Ten, who is now a concession patrolman. Several key suspects and suspects have been arrested one after another. This case is by no means a robbery, but a revenge by the said Number Ten, deliberately using robbery to cover up his evil plan. The whole story is recorded below.</p>
<h3>Patrolman Number Ten</h3>
<p>The so-called Number Ten was formerly a patrolman Number Ten in the Xiang Sheng Iron Factory in Pudong. Now he is a gatekeeper patrolman in Renxingli at the Broadway intersection of the Public Concession, with the number 1206. His name is Zheng Wanming, he is in his forties, from Qingjiang, and lives at No. 44 Hutang Road, Lujiazhai, Pudong. He was originally acquainted with the plaintiff, Hu Changming. In the past, Zheng had acted as a matchmaker for Hu's only beloved daughter (namely the deceased Xiuzhen), trying to betroth her to Zheng's nephew as his wife. However, Hu's wife (namely the deceased Madam Yu) strongly opposed it and stopped it. Zheng knew that Hu was foolish and old, unable to do anything, and was only obstructed by Madam Yu, and the matter did not go as he wished. Therefore, he harbored resentment in his heart. The motive for the tragic case was planted here.</p>
<h3>The Tragic Case Occurred</h3>
<p>Recently, Hu recruited a son-in-law for his beloved daughter as an heir. On the day the son-in-law entered the family, a grand banquet was held to invite relatives and friends. Zheng knew about it beforehand, so on the 28th of last month, he invited his friends Li Wenqi and Jiang Chuanren to his home to secretly discuss a revenge plan. The night after Hu's family held the wine banquet, Zheng took a box cannon and led the way in, Jiang followed behind, and Li watched from outside the door. Thereupon, the blood case occurred in an instant. In addition to shooting and killing Hu, his wife, and his daughter, Zheng also robbed 200 yuan in cash and fled to the fields east of the house.</p>
<h3>Extreme Suspicion</h3>
<p>After the incident, Hu's mind was confused. The Public Security Bureau asked him whether the Number Ten mentioned by Hu's wife before her death was suspected in this case. Hu still tried his best to defend Number Ten (namely Zheng Wanming), insisting that Zheng was very friendly with him and would never use such means. He insisted that the ones who killed his wife and daughter were unfamiliar bandits. However, the Public Security Bureau still did not believe him. District Chief Zhang Mingqin ordered the police detectives to investigate strictly. After three or four days, Hu's mind calmed down slightly, and he suddenly remembered that about two hours before the incident, around 8:00 pm, a neighbor named Li Wenqi came to Hu's house to ask for cold water. Hu was having dinner, so he asked Li to stay and drink together. Li took the opportunity to ask Hu whether his family property was worth more than 1,000 gold. Hu strongly denied it. Li also said that if not 1,000, then 600 or 700 must be there. Hu smiled and ignored it. At the same time, another neighbor, Jiang Chuanren (nicknamed Jiang Dabianzi), also came to Hu's house to pay membership fees. Unexpectedly, two hours later, the incident occurred. Based on this imagined situation, Li and Jiang were highly suspected. He repeated the situation to the Third District and asked them to investigate.</p>
<h3>Fleeing Upon Hearing the News</h3>
<p>Upon receiving the report, District Chief Zhang immediately sent Patrol Officer Liu Huansheng and Police Chief Guo Yongliang, along with Detective Leader Zhang Yingpin, detectives Jiang Binru, Wang Jiheng, etc., to Li's residence at No. 41 Maoyeli, Lujiazhai, and arrested Li Wenqi. They also brought three suspects, Song Jinyu, Guo Yirong, and Shi Yucai, etc., to the district. After Li arrived at the district, he confessed that Zheng Wanming had ordered him to go together, and Jiang Chuanren had also gone. The District Chief then sent personnel to arrest Jiang. At the same time, he ordered Leader Zhang and the detectives to lead the detectives to Zheng Wanming's residence at No. 44 Hutang Road, Lujiazhai, to arrest Zheng. When they arrived, Zheng's house door was wide open, but there was no one inside, and only the furniture had not been moved at all. It was known that Zheng had fled with his family upon hearing the news. The court went to the Public Concession Police Station to investigate and learned that Zheng had not gone to work on the night of the incident and had asked someone else to take his place. Therefore, it was even more certain that he had committed the crime. District Chief Zhang was then reported to first seal Zheng's house and, at the same time, ordered the detectives and police to strictly investigate and arrest the main culprit Zheng Wanming and bring him to justice.</p>
<h3>Confessions of the Suspects</h3>
<p>After several accomplices and suspects in this case were detained in the district, District Chief Zhang interrogated them separately. According to Li Wenqi's confession, he was 33 years old, from Tengxian County, Shandong, and worked as a porter on the wharf. At first, he tried to evade the issue, claiming that he did not follow Zheng to rob and kill. Later, he admitted it without hesitation. According to him, in addition to being a patrolman, Zheng also lent out money at high interest. I borrowed seven yuan from him, and I had to pay 28 copper coins in interest every day. However, I was very poor, and after more than three years, the principal and interest totaled about one hundred and dozens of yuan, which I have not yet repaid. On the 28th of last month, Zheng suddenly invited me to his home to talk. Zheng directly asked me for the debt, and I replied that I was unable to repay it at the moment. Zheng then said, "If you do something for me, not only can you not have to repay the debt, but you can also make a small fortune." Jiang Chuanren also participated in the discussion at that time. After the plan was decided, the three of them went to implement it together. After the goal was achieved, the three of them fled to the fields of Wujia Hall, which had been agreed upon in advance. I received 50 yuan on the spot, which is true. I ask for leniency in the sentence. According to Jiang Chuanren's confession, he was from Yushan County, Jiangxi, and lived at No. 72 Wufu Road, Lujiazhai, running the Jianglou Teahouse. He firmly denied that he had participated in the robbery and murder. According to Song Jinyu's confession, I lived in the same house as Li Wenqi, but I was completely unaware of Li's crime. Guo Yirong confessed that he lived at No. 43 Taiping Bridge in the French Concession and worked in Zhang's residence. He went to Song Jinyu's house to find a friend on that day and was suddenly arrested. According to Shi Wangcai's confession, he lived at No. 28 Maoyeli and worked as a small worker in a cigarette factory. At that time, I was standing in front of Li Wenqi's door and was suddenly arrested by the police detectives in the district. The District Chief then found out that the person who helped Zheng find a guaranteed rental house was Zheng's brother-in-law, Fang Wumen, from Yancheng, who lived at No. 10 Hutangbang. He sent the police to bring Fang to the case and ordered all the people, together with Yu Lianshan, a resident of Qingjiang who first reported the tragic case to the district, to be sent to the Public Security Bureau yesterday for interrogation.</p>
<h3>The Minhang Guangci Hospital Chrysanthemum Exhibition and Play Performance</h3>
<p>The Minhang Guangci Hospital was founded by Mr. Shen Menglian and others. Last autumn, the Shanghai Municipal Local Maintenance Association allocated funds to expand it, adding leaders from all walks of life as hospital directors. Ms. Tao Xiaodong, a graduate of Datong University, was hired as the president of the hospital. She actively improved the education and care matters and entrusted accountant Xu Yongzuo to audit the accounts, using new-style bookkeeping to emphasize the funds. There are currently more than 200 students in the hospital, who are taught in classes according to the elementary school curriculum and also taught crafts. In the past month, more than a dozen people have been admitted as apprentices by the National Goods Store. Over the years, many students have left the hospital and are engaged in various occupations, as detailed in the hospital's annual report. The hospital faces the Huangpu River, and the address is wide and clear with water and trees. Many famous varieties of chrysanthemums are planted in the garden, all of which are cultivated and irrigated by the staff leading the children. The chrysanthemum exhibition will be held on the 12th of this month, and women from all walks of life are invited to visit the hospital. Mr. Huang Jinrong, a hospital director, has also negotiated with all the Shanghai theater troupes to perform together and invited famous actors from the Gong Wu Stage, San Xing Stage, and Tianchan Stage to perform plays for three consecutive days to increase interest.

<h3>The City Public Security Bureau Detective Team Cracks Down on a Large-Scale Drug Pellet Organization - Confiscating More Than Ten Large Burlap Bags of White Powder Raw Materials - Four Large Boxes of Finished Red Pills and Other Supplies - The Main Culprits Liu Zheng Han Li Hou Shan and Others Have Been Arrested</h3>
<p>Lu Ying, the director of the Detective Division of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, suddenly received a secret report at 7:00 am yesterday, stating that someone had set up a large-scale distribution center for drug pellets in the house at No. 5 Gaoxiangtou, which is under the jurisdiction of the Third Branch of the First District. Please send personnel to arrest them as soon as possible. After receiving the report, Lu immediately sent Leader Chen Caifu, along with a large number of detectives, to seize the place. As a result, a large box of red pills was seized on the spot, and Liu Zheng Han and Yu Zhanhe were arrested and brought to the team for interrogation. After the two criminals confessed that the manufacturing center was located at No. 72 Sanminfang, near Haichao Temple, Dongpuyu Road, the original detectives went straight to the Sanminfang house. The center was heavily guarded, but as a result, all the detectives seized the place one by one, totaling more than ten large burlap bags of white powder raw materials for making pills, four large boxes of finished red pills, three large writing desk-style heating ovens, several iron boxes of sugar powder, three large wooden trays, and a large number of other items used for making pills. The criminals Li Hou Shan, Huang Hanqing, Wang Jinsheng, and the woman Wang Li Shi were arrested on the spot. The items and criminals were transported to the team one by one by car. After Director Lu interrogated them one by one, they all admitted to manufacturing and selling them in this city and other places without hesitation. Director Wen was extremely furious upon hearing the news, believing that the criminals dared to set up a center so close to the bureau, which was extremely illegal. He has ordered a strict investigation.</p>

<h3>Another Assassin of Tang Jiapeng Has Been Identified - Zhao Guangfu, a Native of Yangzhou - Admits to the Assassination of Tang Without Hesitation</h3>
<p>Tang Jiapeng, the manager of the Rongji Game Hall in the Great World, was suddenly assassinated and killed by thugs in front of the Great World at around 2:00 am on June 18th of this year. An unnamed man was also killed by stray bullets. After the case occurred, the police authorities of the French Concession paid close attention to the investigation and arrest of the criminals. On the morning of the 28th of last month, Jin Jiulin, the superintendent of the special agency of the French Police, led the detectives on duty, along with Chinese and Western detectives from the Gordon Road Police Station, to arrest a criminal, Zhang Tinggui, also known as Zhang Xiaosizi, a native of Funing, at a stove shop at No. 648 Haifang Road, West Shanghai. He was escorted to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. All the details have been reported in the previous news. The superintendent Jin Jiulin and others also found out that Zhang Tinggui's accomplice, Zhao Guangfu, a native of Yangzhou, was arrested by the Chinese and Western detectives of the Putuo Road Police Station on the 22nd of the same month for carrying a pistol and bullets while passing through Putuo Road in the Public Concession. It was found that he had also committed a robbery case and was escorted to the First Special District Court for trial. On July 24th, Zhao was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment and is currently serving his sentence in the First Special District Prison. The Western Police Chief was immediately reported and transferred to the Second Special District Court to prepare a document. The superintendent Jin led detectives Qian Yumin, Liu Dianlong, Wang Wannian, etc., to the First Special District Court the day before yesterday to transfer Zhao Guangfu to the French Police Station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. Judge Zhang Chaozuo was promoted to preside over the trial. First, the police lawyer Yao Zhao presented the case, stating briefly that the defendant Zhao Guangfu was an accomplice in the assassination of Tang Jiapeng. He was arrested by the Public Concession Police for possessing military firearms and was sentenced to imprisonment by the Special First Court. The police department has investigated and transferred him to the case. The police station has not yet thoroughly investigated the case due to time constraints, and the previously arrested criminal Zhang Tinggui has been rescheduled by the court to be tried on the 13th of this month. It is requested that the defendant be detained temporarily and rescheduled to be tried together with the Zhang Tinggui case after the case is investigated. Upon interrogation, the defendant Zhao Guangfu confessed that he was 28 years old, from Yangzhou, and worked as a carpenter. He used to live in a thatched shed on Pushan Road, Zhabei. He admitted to jointly assassinating Tang Jiapeng. He was invited by Carpenter Zhou Ermu to help. Two days earlier, they agreed to discuss the matter at a stove shop on Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. I went at 11:00 am, but they had already left. Later, they agreed to go to the stove shop again at 8:00 pm the next night and promised to give me 100 yuan after the matter was completed. On the night of the incident, Zhou hired a rickshaw in Zhabei to transport the pistol to the red tin-wrapped cigarette clock opposite the Great World to wait. I went at 1:00 am. Zhou gave me a pistol, and Zhang Tinggui and others waited at the entrance of the Great World together. When Tang came out, I fired three shots at the back of the car and fled. But I did not receive a penny afterwards. After verifying the confession in court, the defendant was ordered to be returned to custody and rescheduled to be tried together with Zhang Tinggui on the 13th.</p>
<h3>News of the Second Major Chess Game Between China, the United States, Britain, and Russia - The Previous Game Had Not Been Decided</h3>
<p>Chess masters from China, the United States, Britain, and Russia held their second international chess game at the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge last night. The notary was Mr. Danai Pan from Portugal. The British, American, and Russian federations included Di Tuigen from Britain, Cui Yi from Russia, and Toping from the United States (represented by Mr. Shiba). China was represented by Pan Jishi, Xie Xiazun, and You Pengxi. The two sides sat at a table together and played against each other. During the opening ceremony, Wang Jianxian, the executive of the YMCA, reported everything, and then the competition began, and the competition was fierce. As a result, the federation won. The previous game (won by China) had not been decided. It is known that the next game plans to separate each team member one by one and use a metronome to urge the game (that is, each person must make a move every minute to determine the final victory).</p>
<h3>Wu Tiecheng's Speech at the Lianhuan Club - Shanghai Has Two Major Dangers</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lianhuan Club held a public banquet last night in honor of its member Wu Tiecheng, the mayor of Shanghai, who also served as the Songhu Garrison Commander. Members Wang Yansong, Yang Hu, Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Xu Peihuang, Wen Hongen, Jiang Qun, Zhang Danru, Wang Boyuan, Pan Gongzhan, Wu Xingya, Wu Kaixian, Dai Gengxin, Yuan Ludeng, Tao Baichuan, Ding Mocun, Wen Jiangang, Zhu Wenqi, Lu Zhongxian, Sun Xueni, Qian Longzhang, Chen Ziming, Jiang Zhigang, Yu Guozhen, Hu Guocheng, Xie Pengfei, Jiang Yichun, Pan Xusheng, Tao Changhai, Zheng Zenan, Ye Jiaxing, Hu Xiyuan, Geng Jizhi, Jin Runxiang, Zhou Bangjun, Lu Wenshao, Lu Jingshi, Dong Yu, Wu Kaisheng, Zhu Shaoping, Wu Zhihao, and Sun Mingqi attended the banquet, totaling more than 60 people. During the banquet, Chairman Wang Xiaolai and Wang Tingsong stood up to give speeches, followed by a speech by Mayor Wu. He briefly stated that he was very grateful for the invitation to the public banquet. He was ordered to lead Shanghai at a time of crisis and shock in the city. Fortunately, with the understanding and mutual assistance of old friends from the club and local people, he was able to pass through smoothly. He felt that he was not competent enough to serve as the Songhu Garrison Commander at the same time. He hoped that his fellow club members would give him advice from time to time. However, he deeply felt that Shanghai was a trading place and a major port. The prosperity and decline of Shanghai should be based on the prosperity and decline of the interior. Now, the rural areas in the interior are bankrupt and the economy is exhausted. The increase in Shanghai's population is faster than any city in the world, and the accumulation of cash in Shanghai is also more than any city in the world. This kind of畸形 development actually hides infinite crises, just like a fish will inevitably dry up when the source of water dries up. Therefore, people in Shanghai should find ways to revive the rural areas and enrich the interior to cultivate their source. All of you here are leaders from all walks of life. I hope you will shoulder this important task and work with people from all walks of life to work hard to revive the rural movement to reduce the crisis in Shanghai. This is one of the dangers. Currently, people from all over the world say that the Second World War will break out in 1936, and some say it will begin in 1937 or 1938. This is not only what Chinese people think, but also what Europeans and Americans speculate. We certainly do not want to confirm when the war will happen, but if a war does happen, its location will be in two places: either in the Pacific Ocean or in the Siberian region. If it happens in the Pacific Ocean, Shanghai will be the center and will inevitably be ravaged. If it happens in the Siberian region, Shanghai will also be implicated. However, how to resist the coming disaster? The 400 million compatriots should gather their strength and prepare urgently for self-rescue under the leadership of the Chinese Kuomintang. The way to self-rescue is nothing more than stabilizing the interior first. Now the government is urgently recovering the bandit areas, which is also to stabilize the interior and enrich the national power. People in Shanghai cannot stand idly by and should assist the government in suppressing the red bandits as an act of self-rescue and saving the country. This is the second danger. The Chinese Kuomintang and the Chinese Kuomintang government have had things that have not satisfied the people due to the actions of a few bad elements in the past, but the Chinese Kuomintang has suffered from unprecedented national disasters in history and still bears its responsibility. It can be worthy of heaven and earth. I hope that all club members will work together to overcome this difficult situation. Then he raised a glass to wish all the club members well. Wu Kaixian, a standing committee member of the Municipal Party Department, then gave a speech on the tragic situation in the bandit areas of Jiangxi. The words were too long to be recorded.</p>
<h3>The Police Trainee School Will Commence Classes; New Police Examination Papers Completely Marked</h3>
<p>The Municipal Police Bureau is holding a police trainee school, and the preparatory committee previously established within the old county office on Penglai Road recruited student police officers. It is reported that the number of applicants reached 677. Physical examinations and oral examinations have been completed. A written examination was also held at Wan Zhu Elementary School in Nine Acres the other day. A reporter went to the school yesterday to inquire with an instructor, who said that all examination papers of the new police applicants have been completely marked. After a short selection process, the training will begin soon. The school is located in Gaochang Temple, which has ample space. Currently, the instructors are compiling teaching materials, and the director will be concurrently held by Wen Hong'en, the head of the Municipal Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables the Executive Yuan, Requesting Correction of Vegetable Cattle Taxation; Taxing by Head is Equivalent to the Revival of Likin</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, requesting correction of the Jiangsu Province's proposal to tax vegetable cattle. The original telegram stated: "To the Nanjing Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance: Having received a letter from the Cattle and Sheep Trade Association stating that the 'Provisional Regulations of Jiangsu Province Prohibiting the Trafficking and Slaughter of Ploughing Cattle' have been promulgated recently and will be implemented soon. However, Article 3 of the regulations stipulates that vegetable cattle slaughtered or trafficked should be taxed at a fixed rate, with detailed rules to be determined separately by the Departments of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction. A copy of the regulations is enclosed for your review. Jiangsu was originally a province where likin was abolished. Recently, Minister Kong took office and declared that no new taxes would be added to reassure our people. Now, Jiangsu Province suddenly levies this new tax, which conflicts with the tax regulations. Please telegraph to argue against it.' After likin was abolished, the only goods taxed were the import, export, and transit duties of the customs, as well as the consolidated tax, tobacco and alcohol tax, and salt tax, all of which fall under the jurisdiction of the central government. The only tax under the jurisdiction of the provincial government is the business tax, which is a behavior tax and not a tax on goods. That is why it differs from likin. Now, Jiangsu Province plans to tax the sale of vegetable cattle by head, which violates the central government's tax system and is equivalent to the revival of likin. We hereby respectfully request your esteemed Yuan (Ministry) to review and correct this matter to maintain the overall abolition of likin and avoid extra-legal burdens, as it is for the public convenience." The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows.</p>
<h3>Huizhou People Telegraph Requesting Exemption from Increased Salt Tax</h3>
<p>The Huining Native Association in Shanghai has received reports from various counties in Xiuning, Yi, Qi, and Wu in recent days, stating that salt in Huizhou has been subject to an additional tax of one yuan per dan, as ordered by the Liangzhe Salt Transport Commissioner. Because Huizhou has suffered from consecutive years of disasters, famine, and banditry, the people's hardships have reached an extreme. Salt is a necessity of life, and the sudden increase in such a heavy tax will cause difficulties for merchants and the people in food supply. The life of the people will be unimaginable. Moreover, this tax increase is only applied to Xiuning and Yi (Xiuning's salt is drawn from the Xiu area, and Qi's salt is drawn from the Yi area), while Shexian is exempt, which is unfair. The association requests an appeal to exempt the increase, so as to reduce the burden. After receiving the report, the association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Salt Affairs Department, and the Liangzhe Salt Transport Commissioner yesterday, requesting them to consider the people's difficulties and grant exemption. It also sent letters to the public groups in each county to jointly strive for a resolution to maximize its effect.</p>

<h3>Hong Kong Happy Valley Fresh Olives 丨Xing Hua Lou Distributes 丨</h3>
<p>The sandalwood olive is produced in Fujian, Guangdong, and other places. Its taste is sweet and palatable, and it is beneficial to the throat and can eliminate coal toxins. Everyone knows and loves to eat it. Recently, it has become popular in the market. However, ordinary olives are bitter and astringent, so those who are not used to eating them do not like them. It is said that the Hong Kong Tai Po Happy Valley has spared no expense on olives, studying them in detail. It has purchased more than 1,000 mu of land in Tai Po to cultivate more than 100,000 olive trees. After years of research, it has succeeded in completely eliminating the bitterness and astringency, obtaining a clear, fragrant, and crispy olive that even those who are not used to eating it can enjoy. It is said that the garden can produce four or five thousand dan of olives each year, which are sold in Hong Kong, Guangdong, Guizhou, and other southern provinces, and are highly praised. Few people in this city know about it. Xing Hua Lou Restaurant on Sima Road has specially reached an agreement with Happy Valley to be the distributor in this city. The olives have now arrived in Shanghai, but the supply is limited. Those who wish to try them should purchase them quickly. The price is set at 45 cents per pound, and wholesale prices are available.</p>
<h3>Kidnapping and Theft Cases Interrogated Simultaneously 丨 Sentences to be Pronounced Separately on a Scheduled Date 丨</h3>
<p>Zhang Zilin, a Fuyang native and foreman for the Public Works Department, had his four-year-old son, Fu Hai (born to a concubine), kidnapped from his home at 722 Weihaiwei Road at around 6:00 AM on April 27th of last year. The kidnappers entered through the back door, went upstairs, and carried Fu Hai away from his bed. The father heard the alarm and gave chase, but the kidnappers opened fire, wounding Zhang and a maid, Li Tao, who died. The ransom note was hidden in a remote part of Chongming, demanding a large sum. Zhang, over fifty, had only this one son. After paying 40,000 yuan in ransom, the Hongkou Police arrested three suspects and sent them to court, where they were sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. The ringleader, Xi Shirong, escaped and could not be found. At 7:00 PM on the 13th of last month, Chinese Detectives Wang Chengying and Yang Xiguang of the Jiaxing Road Police arrested more than ten major thieves, including Wang Jinshan and Chen Desheng, at the Xinxing Vegetable Restaurant at 238 Datong Road and at the Nanshi Railway Station. Chen confessed that he and Yan Shirong and others had committed a kidnapping case, which was the kidnapping of Wang Hai, Fu Hai, at 722 Weihaiwei Road. The detectives learned that Yan was Wang's brother-in-law and arrested Yan's wife, Chen, at 11 Tianbao Road, Junan Lane, Zhabei, along with the instigator and accomplices Wang's wife, Yan's son-in-law Xu Yunsun, accountant Xiang Wenshan, and workers Yang Yuexiang and Mu Xiao Sizi. The suspects were sent to the First Special District Court. Chen Desheng and Xiang Wenshan confessed without hesitation, providing detailed accounts of the kidnapping. The others denied any involvement. During the second court hearing, Yan Chen and Xiang Wenshan completely overturned their previous confessions to the police and in court, claiming that they were nonsense. The interrogating officer, considering that Wang Yan, Xu Yunsun, Yang Yuexiang, and Mu Xiao Sizi were proven by the plaintiff Wang Zilin to have little involvement, allowed them to be released on bail. The others were returned to custody. As reported in this newspaper, the Central Police determined that the 13 thieves, including Wang Jinshan, who were arrested by the Putuo Road Police, had used weapons to rob 11 households, including Yu Hengchang at 44 Parker Road and Guo at 755 McGinn Road, between March of last year and October of this year, with property worth over 1,500 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, the police sent the defendants to the Third Criminal Court in two groups. Judge Wu Zehan first interrogated Wang Jinshan and others for the theft case. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, and the victims testified about their experiences. The defendants' testimonies were inconsistent, and they were all ordered to be returned to custody. The sentence will be pronounced on the morning of the 11th. The kidnapping case was then heard, and Chen Desheng suddenly denied his involvement, claiming that he was in his hometown of Jiangbei on that day and that his previous confessions to the police and in court were false. Witnesses Xu Asan and Xu Yongming testified that Xiang Wenshan was indeed in Xietang Township, Suzhou, on April 27th, handling fertilizers. Xiang Wenshan and Yan Chen repeated their previous denials. Yang Yuexiang, Mu Xiao Sizi, Wang Yan, and Xu Yunsun insisted that they were falsely accused and requested an investigation. They retained lawyers Fu Ganghou and Huang Xiubo to defend them. Wang Zilin stated that the two kidnappers he saw were around 20 years old, and the shooter was around 30 years old, both being thin. Wang Chen and the others were not seen by him. Wang's child, Jie Hai, is currently ill and away from Shanghai, so even if he were to appear in court, he would not be able to identify them, as he was not yet three years old when he was kidnapped and does not know anything. After the lawyers debated in court, Judge Fang ordered Chen Desheng, Yan Chen, and Xiang Wenshan to be returned to custody, and Yang Yuexiang, Mu Xiao Sizi, Wang Yan, and Xu Yunsun were each released on their original bail. The sentence will be pronounced on the 14th.</p>
<h3>The Strongman Cha Ruilong's Family Property Dispute Case 丨 The Grandfather Sold Pancakes and Had No Property 丨 The Current Property Was Created by His Father 丨 The Cousin Sues for Encroachment on Ancestral Property 丨</h3>
<p>Cha Ruilong, the strongman actor from the Yihua Film Company, is being sued by his cousin Rui Lian through lawyers Zhu Sifu, Yang Ruinian, and Li Mian at the First Special District Court for occupying over 100,000 yuan of ancestral property and refusing to distribute his cousin's share of 50,000 yuan. The case has been heard once, as reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Xiangzu opened the Fifth Criminal Court for a hearing. Cha Ruilong and his lawyer Yuan Yang'an were also present. Lawyer Li stated that the plaintiff's previous request for the court to obtain the case files of the property division dispute between the defendant and his sister Xin Yuan from the District Court had not been fulfilled. Judge Wu stated that the case files had not yet been obtained. Cha Rui Lian stated that the ancestral property was worth about 100,000 yuan. His father and uncle never divided it, so he should be entitled to half of it. He is suing because the defendant refuses to hand it over. As evidence, Xin Yuan removed his property from the list after the dispute with the defendant before the division was made. Cha Ruilong testified that his grandfather sold pancakes and left no property. The current property was created by his father. The judge asked if he had said anything about removing the name of Decun (the plaintiff's father) during the dispute with Cha Xinyuan. Cha Ruilong replied that he had not. The judge asked how much Xin Yuan received. He answered that she received one-sixth, about 8,000 yuan. The court stated that the case files from the District Court had not yet been obtained, making it difficult to proceed, and adjourned the hearing for another date.</p>

<h3>Japanese Thug Arrested for Extortion</h3>
<p>The Dahonglou Restaurant at 406 Broadway closed down due to business failure and was being liquidated. The restaurant had equipment and miscellaneous items worth 400 yuan. The court ordered an auction to pay off creditors. The buyers of the above items were Fan Yimin, a Chongming native and used goods merchant; Xie Yongjin, a Ningbo native; and Tao Lianggen and Cai, both from Tongzhou. They went to the restaurant at around 10:00 AM with judicial police to take delivery of the items, issued invoices, and moved various equipment out. Cai and the bailiff went to the court to pay the money. However, Li Asan, a Zhenjiang native; Wang Amao, a Shanghai native; and Zhang Shifu, all local thugs, learned of this and gathered a dozen accomplices to go to the restaurant. Li Asan asked who bought the items. Wang Amao said that they were brothers from the Huishan Road area and there were many of them. They needed 50 yuan for expenses; otherwise, they would not be allowed to take the items away. Xie Yongjin replied that the boss, surnamed Cai, had not returned from paying the money at the court and would inform them when he returned. Zhang Shifu then smashed a handful of parts, a teapot, and two mud statues. Li Asan then punched Xie Yongjin in the chest, knocking him to the ground, and said that he had to pay 50 yuan. Seeing the menacing situation, Fan Yimin blew the whistle. Chinese Police Officer No. 3226 and Chinese Detectives Chen Yonggui and Sun Shouzhong arrived and arrested Li and the other three, along with the destroyed teapot and mud statues, and took them to the Huishan Police Station. The police chief ordered them to be detained and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District yesterday morning. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin presented the case, stating that the defendants were repeat offenders and requested an adjournment to investigate other cases. The evidence and court invoices were presented for inspection. The plaintiffs Fan Yimin, Xie Yongjin, and Tao Lianggen testified about their experiences. The defendants' testimonies were hesitant. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be returned to custody and reheard in seven days.</p>

<h3>Enemies Invade While Internal Strife Persists</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>▲Aggression Ambitions Just Beginning, But Strife Arises Within the Walls</p>
<p>More than half of the National Products Year has passed, how much progress has everyone reviewed? Just as you are ashamed and have nowhere to hide, the following is recorded in a Tokyo dispatch on October 31:</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has synthesized information from various sources, stating that the movement to boycott Japanese goods in China is gradually declining. Especially in North China, centered on Tianjin, Jinan, and Qingdao, the trend is completely unchanged from before the September 18th Incident. The Yangtze River area has also recently improved. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Bureau of Commerce, in view of Japan's lack of control over trade with China, must plan to establish a large company and grant it the exclusive privilege of trading with China. The investigation has already begun. All parties unanimously advocate that the establishment of a control mechanism for export companies to China is indeed necessary and will inevitably be realized soon.</p>
<p>This bad news of enemy invasion, sharpening its knives and pressing closer, is truly shocking to read, causing a cold sweat. However, at the same time, three pieces of news were received:</p>
<p>1.  The dispute between the San Shan Guild Hall and the National Products Introduction Center, one side saying that it hindered the transport of national products, and the other side saying that it robbed people of their livelihood.</p>
<p>2.  The conflict between the business community of Bengbu and the National Products Exhibition.</p>
<p>3.  The business community of Xuzhou opposes the National Products Exhibition's dumping of national products.</p>
<p>These three pieces of news of internal strife were published in the newspaper at the same time, which cannot help but cause heartache and tears. The National Products Introduction Center said: "Those who hinder national products do not hinder the enemy, but hinder their own countrymen. Those who oppose national products do not oppose the enemy, but oppose their own countrymen. There is nothing more painful in the world than this." It is clearly for national products, for pure national products, that we are working hard to promote them, how can we bear to hinder them, to oppose them. In the midst of this advocacy of national products, there is such a phenomenon, if it is not due to misunderstanding, or ulterior motives, there is absolutely no such reason in the world. Even if there is a conflict of interest, one should suppress one's personal interests and take the overall situation into consideration, and even more so, one should not care about one's livelihood and exploit industry and commerce. In this era of national product crisis, when the situation is critical, all those with blood and conscience must broaden their horizons, shift their psychology of dealing with their own countrymen, and the concept of competition among their own industries, and focus on the outside world, defeat their own countrymen, and defeat their own industries. This is a despicable act, not a hero. If you are a hero, think about how to resist enemy goods? How can you prevent enemy goods from changing their appearance? How can you sanction unscrupulous merchants who sell Japanese goods in bulk? Put this kind of thinking, this kind of writing, this kind of strength, and use it all to resist enemy goods, then you can be worthy of society, worthy of the country, worthy of yourself.</p>
<p>National Products Talk</p>
<h3>Are Goods Changing?</h3>
<p>— He Gongxing</p>
<p>The biggest problem with national products is the change in appearance. The samples at the time of sale and the wholesale goods at the time of delivery have changed. The first product of a factory and the second or third product have changed even more. If it is said that one batch is better than another, this is a manifestation of the "improvement" and "progress" of goods, and national products have long been developed, so there is no need for the general public to advocate them. However, one batch is not as good as the previous batch. If sales are booming and goods are rushed, they are made worse and worse, until they are "concrete and micro." Then (returns) (fines) and disputes continue. What is the reason for this?</p>
<p>If it is said that manufacturers are all accustomed to cutting corners, it is inevitable to write them off in one stroke, which is a great injustice. Except for a few factory owners who disregard the overall situation and are eager to make profits, or inevitably make shoddy goods, almost all others hope that their products are excellent, so that people will be happy to buy and use them permanently, but the results often do not meet their wishes, and they still change a lot. This causes users to scold and manufacturers to lose heart. What is the reason for this? In short, the lack of standardization of raw materials is the reason.</p>
<p>In recent years, although my country's national products manufacturing industry has seen daily development, most of the various raw materials it needs still rely on foreign countries, and due to capital relations, it is often unable to purchase in large quantities. Most of them wait until they are needed to purchase them in small quantities. Since the raw materials are not neat, and the goods are often of poor quality, today German goods are used, and tomorrow French goods are used. Other British, Russian, Japanese and American goods are almost purchased in rotation. Since the producing areas are different, the properties are naturally difficult to be the same. To manufacture the same goods with different raw materials, is something that is not allowed in fact. This is the biggest reason for the change in the appearance of national products. People praise the Red Tin Pack cigarettes manufactured by the British American Tobacco Company, saying that they have not changed in decades, but it should be known that the raw materials used for making cigarettes have also been the same for decades.</p>
<p>Today, there are thousands of national products factories in Shanghai, and only a handful of manufacturers of raw materials. One is "finished products". If they are not sold well in place A, they can be sold to place B. If Zhang San does not buy them, they can be sold to Li Si. Regardless of whether the results are profitable or loss-making, there is no doubt that they will be sold. The other is "unfinished products". Not only cannot they be widely promoted, but they cannot be used alone. Buyers only need a few factories that need the goods. Because the raw materials used in the manufacture of raw materials also lack standardization, they have long caused buyers to doubt their suitability, and there are also foreign goods cheaper than ours, surrounding and competing for sale. If they cannot be sold, they will be stored in the factory, almost like dirt, and there is no other use. People are not stupid, so why bother to do this business without certainty?</p>
<p>Therefore, today, if we want national products to develop, we must first seek the consistency of national product goods, and if we want national product goods to be consistent, we must first seek the great development of the manufacturing raw materials industry. When using raw materials, we must identify the brand, and when manufacturing raw materials, we must identify the producing area. If we identify a certain raw material, we must compare which producing area is the most suitable. If it is not the material from that area, and the output is cut off, we must not easily change it. From then on, national products are standardized because of the raw materials, and the products are consistent from beginning to end.</p>
<p>National Products Discussion</p>
<h3>A Frank Word to National Products Manufacturers for the National Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Zhou Chengxun</p>
<p>By definition, the true purpose of the National Products Exhibition is to introduce domestic products in great detail and completeness, and to use a systematic and explanatory display method to enable all people to have the opportunity to recognize national products and to promote the idea of using national products as much as possible. However, if we examine the reality, national product exhibitions have been widely held in various places for the past seven or eight years, and national product manufacturers have worked hard to participate, has the above-mentioned effect been achieved? We will not talk about this very abstract question for the time being, but what we have felt in fact is a lot of painful reactions, and we have to give some honest advice to the national product manufacturers with a sincere attitude.</p>
<p>What kind of painful reactions? That is, some national product manufacturers simply do not understand the true meaning of the National Products Exhibition, and believe that participating in the National Products Exhibition is tantamount to temporarily setting up a sales place, and is tantamount to having an opportunity to clear out bottom goods. Therefore, they do things carelessly and only see profit. Over the years, the number of factories seeking profit has increased day by day at various national product exhibitions, and national product manufacturers who truly have ideological work have gradually decreased. In order to clear out bottom goods, local sales stores sell cheaply everywhere, which disrupts the stable market situation and causes dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Recently, the business community in Bengbu shouted the slogan "Down with dumping, welcome exhibitions," and refused to allow local national product manufacturers to hold a National Products Exhibition. This is a good example. The reason they refused is: the rural economy in the mainland is declining to an irreparable degree, and the purchasing power is so</p>
<h3>Notice to Readers</h3>
<p>This magazine has been published for 44 issues. With the humble intention of promoting national products, it has won the praise of comrades. In the future, it intends to seek improvement in terms of materials and style. The materials should focus on practicality and not on empty talk, the writing style should be lively and not complicated, and the intention should be new. The style should be lively, and future submissions should focus on practicality, liveliness, and interest, so that readers can be effective as a guide. The number of words is two to three hundred, at most five hundred. Long articles with empty theories, ordinary language, no highlights, or those that are overly promotional will not be published. Please pay attention. (Editor)</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>weak, if they come with the purpose of clearing out inventory, not only will they go against the true meaning of the National Products Exhibition, but the dumping will also inevitably fail. To promote national products, it is not about selling, but about a complete exhibition. These words that hit the nail on the head are truly a lesson worth considering deeply and urgently reforming for national product factories.</p>
<p>We admire the spirit of all group organizations that lead national product factories to travel around, but we do have great regrets about the national product manufacturers who misunderstand the National Products Exhibition. I believe that the National Products Exhibition in the future must change its goals and earnestly implement the following principles:</p>
<p>1.  Absolutely no selling. 2. Strictly review the degree of products produced by participating factories. 3. Introduce to the public the origin, quality, and manufacturing process of national products by various methods. 4. Guide local sales stores as much as possible on the advantages and disadvantages of sales and purchasing methods. 5. Establish national product showrooms everywhere to leave a lasting impression on the public.</p>
<p>By implementing the above five principles, the manufacturing, sales, and consumption aspects will all benefit greatly, and the true meaning of the National Products Exhibition will be clearly expressed. Otherwise, if we continue to hold exhibitions everywhere with the idea of clearing out inventory, resulting in rejection in the east and unwelcome in the west, how can we ask about the future of national products?</p>
<p>Contributing Opinions</p>
<h3>Several National Product Substitutes That Need to Be Self-Made Urgently</h3>
<p>— Pillow Wood</p>
<p>In recent years, efforts to manufacture national product substitutes have achieved good results, but there are still many substitutes that have not been self-made by Chinese factories and still only seek foreign goods. Now, I will list a few small industries that are in the greatest demand for urgent use, so that those who are ambitious and capable can quickly initiate preparations, research and manufacture, and save the outflow of profits.</p>
<p>▲Pen Holders and Nibs丨These are small items. Pen holders cost one dime per piece, and good ones cost three or four dimes. Nibs cost one cent per piece, and good ones cost four or five cents. Considering the number of people who use pens nationwide, including parties, governments, industries, businesses, schools, and institutions, there are a total of 15 million people who need them. It is estimated that each person consumes two pen holders and six nibs per year, then the annual consumption is as high as five or six million yuan. Perhaps the facts are even more than this. Now, these are all flowing into the hands of foreigners, how can we not recover them!</p>
<p>▲Galvanized Steel丨From the Shen Bao Yearbook, we can see that the import of galvanized steel reaches 800,000 dan per year, which is truly amazing. Among them, tinplate (i.e., lead skin) accounts for 409,000 dan, and galvanized wire accounts for 238,000 dan. And what about our country? Of course, there is no production at all. However, on the other hand, we see that the export of iron ore is 98,270,500 dan. Although it cannot be said that all of it has been turned into galvanized steel, if Chinese people can keep a part of it to make it themselves, it is also a lot of resistance.</p>
<p>▲Color Dyes丨Before the European War, indigo dyes were all supplied by Germany. After the war, Britain and Japan competed with each other. In the end, we have not yet produced our own goods, and we eat in foreign dyes worth 40 million taels of customs silver from the customs every year.</p>
<p>▲White Sugar丨Our country's local sugar is not pure white, so most of the high-quality white sugar is foreign goods. Although the current Republic of China Sugar Factory is set up by Chinese people, the results of competition are still unpredictable. I hope that those who are capable will help them.</p>
<p>▲Clocks丨Everyone, look at the clocks in your homes, most of them have the English words "Made in Japan". How terrible is this? Now I hope that China has clock-making factories, because this is not as precise as the watch industry. It does not matter if it is a little rougher. I hope that enthusiastic people will start doing it immediately.</p>
<p>▲Pencils丨Recently, it seems that a national product, Dahua Pencil, has been launched on the market. I am very fortunate, but it is impossible to resist Venus and Staedtler by relying on one company. Moreover, the factory is in Hong Kong, so the raw materials such as wood, stone houses, and sand may not be purely national products. It is not that the reporter is demanding, but I hope that someone will set up a factory in the inland of China near the forest. The graphite stored in our country is also very rich.</p>
<p>The above are just a few items that the reporter thinks are widely used and urgently needed. There are many others, but due to space limitations, I cannot list them all.</p>
<h3>We Need Farmers to Recognize National Products</h3>
<p>— Yao Xingshu</p>
<p>The fact that has already told us that the old China is a country with backward production. Therefore, today's compatriots are saying that they are advocating national products. However, unfortunately, the frequent foreign insults and internal chaos have formed a symbol of the bankruptcy of the rural economy in our country. No matter how loud you shout "advocating national products", the fact is that your national products are piled up in the warehouse and cannot be sold as much as possible. Of course, this economic control is more terrible than any other force. Therefore, if we want to promote national products, we should start by publicizing them in the rural areas.</p>
<p>We should not rely on waving flags and shouting in big cities to advocate national products. We should expand to rural areas to promote national products. We should not rely on a few advertisements to brag, and at the same time, we must consider the improvement of national products. Because in modern luxury cities, those decadent compatriots are mostly pretentious and deaf, and they are all full of standard foreigners. Their diet and daily life are all imported goods. Although there are also enlightened people who throw away their 1933-style foreign clothes and wear cheap and beautiful local cloth, readers! Please close your eyes and think about it. How many compatriots are really advocating national products?</p>
<p>Therefore, although this National Products Year has passed three-quarters of the time, we will not guess whether the past achievements have been successful. In the future, we may change a goal and move to the countryside to carry out activities. Although it is said that this year, our rural economy is bankrupt, and farmers can no longer afford to buy things, but I think at least we can make farmers have a considerable understanding of the two words "national products"!</p>
<p>Visit Notes</p>
<h3>A Visit to a National Goods Wax Paper Factory</h3>
<p>— Píng Nán</p>
<p>Visiting a national goods factory is one of the most joyful things for us. There are thoughts before the visit, and even more thoughts after the visit. Taking advantage of the Double Tenth Festival during this period of national crisis, I accepted an invitation from a friend to visit Mr. Chén Bǎo Shēng, the manager of Qín Yè Stationery Company in the South City, and asked him to take me on a tour of their national goods wax paper factory. He personally led me to Dǒngjiādù, crossed the river to the shore of Zhāngjiābāng, and then took a rickshaw east for about a mile to reach Hújiā Wooden Bridge. There, I saw a factory building in the field with the words "Qín Yè Stationery Company First Factory" written in large characters on the roof. The factory director, Mr. Lǐ Jìyún, greeted us warmly. Mr. Chén said that there was a second factory located at the foot of Tóngjūn Mountain in Tónglú County, Zhèjiāng, which collected raw materials and specialized in making the base paper for wax paper. It employed 150-160 male and female workers, all of whom were provided with food and lodging because the factory was located far from the village. This first factory was responsible for waxing and packaging. It employed only fifty-odd male and female workers. After speaking, he led me to the factory to tour the different sections. In the wax paper section, there were two four-open printing presses that printed the lines and the Three Children Flying a Kite trademark on the wax paper. This trademark was also known as the "Kite" brand. After the ink was dry, it was transported to the waxing room. The waxing room had four rooms, one for mixing and melting the wax materials, which only contained equipment such as boilers and iron boxes. The other three rooms contained six waxing machines, with stoves underneath the machines, burning quite hot. Two workers sat on the left and right sides of each machine. One worker took the printed paper with lines and fed it into the machine. As the machine turned, the other worker took the waxed paper out and lightly blew on it with their breath before placing it on a rack. This completed the waxing process. Mr. Chén said that the heat in the furnace had a specific limit; too much or too little would not work. Therefore, each machine was equipped with a thermometer to serve as a standard to avoid the unevenness of the wax on the paper. In addition, there were rooms for sorting and packing into tubes. Next, we went to the base paper section, where the papermaking tools were neatly arranged. Mr. Chén said that the base paper work only lasted five months each year, and all work stopped during hot weather because the base paper relied on gelatin, so it was impossible to work at that time. Next, we went to the colored chalk section, where we saw equipment such as gypsum melting stoves, grinding machines, and copper mold screening cabinets. After that, we went to the woodworking and steel tools section, where we saw the production and assembly of steel pens, steel plates, rubber sticks, silk screens, etc., which was quite busy. Mr. Chén then unfolded the lid of a fully assembled mimeograph machine, attached a printing frame covered with silk to protect the wax paper and allow for printing of an additional 100-200 sheets. The machine knob was equipped with a spring, so it would pop open automatically after printing. Half of the box also had a cover, which unfolded into an ink pad and was placed beside the box, making it very convenient to use the ink. Inside the box were compartments for storing rubber sticks, wax paper steel plates, steel pens, and other stationery. The outside of the box had leather buttons for easy carrying. Mr. Chén said that the steel plate had been improved many times and could now be used to write landscapes and figures. He showed several works, which were quite admirable. This is indeed a testament to the progress of national goods factories.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts on National Goods</h3>
<p>— Qià</p>
<p>(I) Prelude</p>
<p>If we pay attention to daily life, there are often interesting materials in every detail. Here are some fragmentary impressions, collected because they are about national goods. Some are short but meaningful, and can also serve as a warning to us!</p>
<p>(II) Purely National Goods</p>
<p>Ms. Gé Chénghuì: Perhaps the only purely national goods in this place are these little babies!</p>
<p>(III) The Gate of the Grand Theater</p>
<p>The Grand Theater, known as the number one movie theater in the Far East, has all its internal equipment imported, but the two most prominent doors are made of Fújiàn lacquerware.</p>
<p>(IV) Summer</p>
<p>In the summer, I wore a long gown made of Indian silk. My friend ridiculed me as an "Ah Si" (a derogatory term for a servant). The listener took it to heart, and I was sweating profusely.</p>
<p>(V) Don't Advocate</p>
<p>Zhái Kègōng said: Standing from the perspective of the production industry, we should not advocate national goods, because we want to produce standard goods without relying on advocacy.</p>
<p>(VI) The Emotional Factor</p>
<p>Chéng Shǒuzhōng said: Relying solely on advocacy, the sales of national goods only have an emotional factor, which is temporary.</p>

<p>Time: Twelve o'clock on a certain day in 1933.</p>
<p>Location: The living room of a middle-class family.</p>
<p>Characters: Father, Mother, Son.</p>
<p>Mother: The weather is gradually getting colder. Huá'er's clothes are not yet ready. What kind of material do you think is most suitable to buy?</p>
<p>Father: Really, I forgot. Well, let's go buy it right after we eat. Fortunately, today is Thursday, and I took leave to stay at home. I think foreign goods are more authentic, and the price is only a little more expensive.</p>
<p>Huá'er: No, I heard the teacher say that this year is the National Goods Year. All Chinese people should buy Chinese goods and should not buy foreign goods. Moreover, current Chinese goods are much more advanced than before, and the price is also cheaper than foreign goods. If I wear foreign goods to school, I will be laughed at by my classmates...</p>
<p>Father: Oh! Let's buy Chinese goods!</p>
<p>Mother: Oh! This child is really ambitious. Let's go buy Chinese goods...</p>

<p>Special Education News</p>
<h3>Reading the Outline of the National Basic Education Plan in Guǎngxī Province (II)</h3>
<p>— Qín Fèngxiáng</p>
<p>(III) Methods: In countries with highly developed industry and commerce, young people are obsessed with vanity, abandoning the countryside and flocking to the cities. This causes the cities to become congested, while the countryside suffers from atrophy. Recently, the cities have also begun to decline. Therefore, those who are concerned about the times advocate a "return to the countryside" in the hope of reversing the situation. Now, industry and commerce in our country are depressed, and agriculture is declining. The reason for this is the exploitation by foreign powers, which affects the entire country. This is completely different from other countries where there is partial, abnormal development, causing the countries to poison themselves. Our countryside has abundant surplus labor, and the construction of industry and commerce is just beginning. Therefore, the plan for now is to enable all surplus labor to have the opportunity to engage in production, and not to be wasted. This alone would be a great blessing. There is no need to study whether the children of farmers should always be farmers, or the children of industrialists should always be industrialists. It doesn't matter if agriculture transforms into industry, industry into commerce, or commerce into agriculture. The original proposal hopes that young students will cooperate with labor and guide the people to assist the government in construction, which is a good idea. However, party hacks, corrupt officials, education pests, gangsters, and bandits cannot be considered professions, and ambitious young people would not deign to be them. The original proposal lists the countryside, shops, and factories, which already encompass all occupations. However, they are all unified under the phrase "return to," as if all ambitious young people in society are leaving their current occupations to pursue something else. They do not know that it is because they are forced by external forces and cannot easily find employment. Also, what needs construction now is not only the countryside. Young people are even more important than children in assisting the government. Therefore, I propose the following wording: "1. Guide children, young people, and adults in developing diligent habits, so that they can devote themselves to productive enterprises and assist the government in establishing the foundation for social and economic construction. 2. Guide children, young people, and adults in developing disciplined actions, so that they can devote themselves to autonomous undertakings and assist the government in establishing the foundation for social and political construction. 3. Guide children, young people, and adults in developing creative interests, so that they can devote themselves to the national rejuvenation and assist the government in establishing the foundation for social and cultural construction."</p>
<p>(IV) Work: At the beginning of the implementation of universal education in various countries, the schooling period was very short. Those who blindly admire the current state of advanced countries and advocate extending the length of compulsory education in our country are indulging in excessive expectations. Now, the original proposal takes into account the reality and advocates shortening the length of schooling, which is a very good idea. However, since the name "national basic education" has already been proposed to encompass the entire system, there is no need to retain the old names of "compulsory education" and the illogical "mass education." This would avoid giving narrow-minded people the opportunity to arbitrarily establish factions and divide authority. Children aged six to nine have relatively poor learning abilities. Providing them with the education of the first and second grades of primary school yields limited results and is easily forgotten. When they grow older, it will be of no practical use, and some of these children are very suitable for further education. The connection of future courses will definitely be difficult. Also, militia, self-government, and cooperation are to adults what language, arithmetic, and nature are to children. These should be specified separately in the curriculum or training matters. There is no need to elaborate on them in this article. Therefore, I propose the following wording: "1. Children aged six to ten should be free to attend school and receive national basic education in ordinary primary schools. 2. Children aged ten to sixteen should be forced to attend school and receive two years of national basic education. 3. Young people aged sixteen to twenty should be forced to attend school and receive one year of national basic education. 4. Adults over the age of twenty should receive national basic education for a corresponding period." (To be continued)</p>

<h3>The Ministry of Education Explains the Phased Implementation of the School System</h3>
<p>The following are three orders from the Ministry of Education regarding the explanation of the school system, curriculum, and methods for retroactive qualification: (1) The Beijing Municipal Social Bureau submitted a proposal that the principals of private schools should not be selected as directors of the school to clarify powers and avoid disputes. The Ministry of Education explained that the principals of private schools are elected by the board of directors, and the directors can also be elected as principals. If disputes arise in the board of directors, they should be handled in accordance with Article 12, Section 2 of the Regulations for Private Schools. (2) The Shānxī Education Department, according to the Provincial Fourth Normal School, requested whether the curriculum for new normal school students should still be handled in accordance with the Provisional Standards for Secondary School Curriculum, Senior High School Normal Department. The Ministry of Education instructed that before the official standards for the normal school curriculum are promulgated, they should still follow the Provisional Standards for Senior High School Normal Department Curriculum. (3) Xuē Yī'è requested the approval of retroactive recognition of the graduation qualifications of Private Fùdàn University. The Ministry of Education instructed that the applicant graduated before the school was formally recognized by the former Beijing Ministry of Education. Their graduation qualifications should not be retroactively recognized according to the old practice of the former ministry. However, they may follow the relief measures in Item 6 of the standards for retroactive qualification established in this year's Instruction No. 8699 of this Ministry and must undergo a qualification examination. You are hereby informed.</p>

<h3>Inspector of the Ministry of Education Goes to Zhèjiāng for Inspection</h3>
<p>(Háng Conf.) Dài Xià, an inspector of the Ministry of Education, was sent by the Ministry to Zhèjiāng for inspection.

<h3>The Educational Film Association Plans to Compile the China Film Yearbook</h3>
<p>After the China Educational Film Association previously passed the resolution to compile the China Film Yearbook, it organized an editorial committee to be responsible for compiling the yearbook. It has already sent a letter to hire Chén Lìfū as the chief editor, and Wáng Pínglíng and Dài Cè as full-time editors. Lì Jiāxiáng, Lǐ Jǐngbì, Pān Gōngzhǎn, and Zhāng Chángrén are serving as editors, separately collecting materials and starting to edit. Regarding the solicitation of foreign materials, the China Educational Film Association plans to send letters to the embassies and consulates stationed abroad, and the Ministries of Interior and Education of various countries, requesting them to send regulations and rules regarding films for reference. It is also reported that the full-time editor Dài Cè has now gone to Shànghǎi to conduct on-site investigations of various film companies in Shànghǎi and collect books that can be used as reference materials for compiling the film yearbook. It is planned to print 5,000 copies of this yearbook, with the final draft due by the end of February and publication by the end of March.</p>

<h3>A Solemn Statement by the Film Censorship Committee Regarding the Appeal of Three Film Merchants Published in Western Newspapers</h3>
<p>The Film Censorship Committee of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior made a solemn statement regarding a news article titled "The Appeal of Three Film Merchants" published in the editorial of the North China Daily News on September 14th and the Greater Shanghai Evening Post on the 15th, which involved the committee in many ways. The committee stated that the item "each film requires a fee of 1,500 yuan" was particularly alarming. The committee stated, "The committee is responsible for film censorship administration, and the legal procedures are very strict. Film censorship is conducted in the order of applications. The censorship fee for foreign-made films is 10 yuan for every 500 meters, and films less than 500 meters are also calculated as 500 meters. The consumption fee for domestic films is 15 yuan for long films and 5 yuan for short films. The license fee for each approved film is 3 yuan. Regarding the censorship work, films are screened and censored once each morning and afternoon, and sometimes also at night to ensure promptness. With such strict procedures, there should be no cause for concern. However, it is feared that the outside world is not fully aware, and unscrupulous individuals may take advantage of this to defraud merchants of money directly and indirectly damage the reputation of the committee. Therefore, in November of last year, the committee made all procedures into a complete notice (attached separately) and published them in various newspapers in Beijing and Shànghǎi for five or six days in a row, which was visible to all. But now, according to the aforementioned records, it is quite unexpected. For the sake of the future of the film industry and the reputation of the committee, various company representatives in Beijing, including Ge Weichang, Yu Daorui, Gu Zurong, Zhou Fangzhi, Liang Bo, and Ding Bowen, were summoned to the committee to inquire about the details. They all stated, 'The handling fee for each foreign-made long film is 30 yuan, and the handling fee for each short film is 3 yuan. From application to receiving the license, the total cost, including printing, transportation, and censorship consumption fees, is about 80 to 120 yuan. There are no other special fees or entertainment expenses. The application procedures for domestic films are either handled by friends or entrusted to theater managers in Beijing, and the handling fees are roughly the same as for foreign films.' At the same time, a letter was sent to the China Film Federation in Shànghǎi to inquire with various companies, and the reply stated, 'All members of this federation are aware that the censorship fee has a fixed amount, which is absolutely uniform. The reported fee of 1,500 yuan per film may be the combined calculation of tariffs, miscellaneous fees, and censorship fees required for foreign films entering China.' Recently, a film expense survey form filled out by MGM, sent by the China Film Federation in Shànghǎi, showed that the maximum cost of transporting each film to China was no more than 1,036 yuan, and the average cost was about 750 yuan. After this multifaceted investigation, it is clear that this record is completely untrue and needs to be solemnly corrected. It is urgent to list the facts of the process and send a letter to your office to disclose the truth as news and correct the public opinion. We are deeply grateful to the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Interior Film Censorship Committee." The original manuscript of the notice distributed to various newspapers in Beijing and Shànghǎi in November of the 21st year is attached below: "The committee's inspection of films has set procedures for the handling of the film, payment of fees, registration, arrangement of the schedule, receipt of the license, and receipt of the film, which are difficult to change. Regarding the expenses, domestic films are not charged a censorship fee, only a consumption fee of 15 yuan for long films and 5 yuan for short films. Foreign films are charged a censorship fee of 10 yuan for every 500 meters, and the license fee is 2 yuan, plus a stamp duty of 1 yuan, all within the scope of laws and regulations, which must not be exceeded. Recently, it has been heard that some people are arbitrarily making a show outside, or deceiving film merchants, claiming to be able to help with lobbying, provide convenience, or making illegal demands from film merchants under the pretext of agency applications, or fabricating facts and slandering each other, which are all violations of the law. In order to uphold the law, this committee will search for evidence and pursue the matter according to law. If anyone obtains evidence of making a show, they should report it to this committee for legal action. Film merchants are also requested to pay close attention and not be fooled by those who make a show because of expectations, resulting in losses and inconvenience. This is hereby announced."</p>

<h3>Preferential Treatment for Primary and Secondary School Students to Visit the Circus</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau previously received a report from Gu Jiwu, the principal of the Municipal Shuji Elementary School, stating that the importance of direct observation in common sense education has been generally recognized by educators. The German Haikingbo Circus troupe has come to Shanghai to perform, and it has a variety of rare and exotic animals. If children can witness it in person, they will benefit greatly. Therefore, it is sincerely requested to negotiate with the Haikingbo Circus troupe to give all children in the city a good opportunity to visit for free. When the bureau sent personnel to negotiate, a preferential treatment method has been agreed upon. All visitors will be charged a discount of 50 cents per person, with the principle of being able to get a seat. Visitors to the zoo will be charged a discount of 10 cents per person. If schools want to lead students to visit the zoo or performances, they should report the number of people to the bureau before this Saturday (the 11th), and pay the fees.

<h3>Students Studying in Japan Expelled and Returned to Shanghai ▲This Year, the Number of Laborers and Students Expelled and Returned to China Has Reached More Than 1,000 ▲Taking Landscape Photos, Accused of Violating the Prohibition Order, Detained in the Police Station, and Finally Expelled</h3>
<p>Japan is excluding Chinese people, prohibiting Chinese workers from entering the country, and even those engaged in kimono and barbering businesses are only allowed to leave Japan and return to China, and are not allowed to go to Japan from China. This year, the number of Chinese people and students studying in Japan who have been successively expelled and returned to China has reached more than 1,000. Every month, there are often batches of overseas Chinese who have been expelled arriving in Shanghai, mostly from Qingtian, Yongjia, and Fujian in Zhejiang Province, etc. This has become commonplace and cannot be fully recorded. This time, the Shanghai Maru of the Japan Mail Steamship Company came to Shanghai, and our Chinese students Wu Chengxian, Liu Qiaosen, Li Rong, and Zhong Yuli were also arrested by the Japanese authorities from Tokyo, Kobe and other places, first detained in the police station, and then escorted onto the ship and expelled back to Shanghai. What the Japanese used to apply to Chinese laborers is now being applied to students. It is found that the expulsion of these students this time was due to taking landscape photos while traveling in various parts of Japan, which aroused the jealousy of the Japanese police, who accused them of violating the entry prohibition order and suspected them, and detained each person in the police station. Without asking right or wrong, they forced them to be expelled and ordered them to take the Shanghai Maru wheel to Shanghai, and were not allowed to go to Japan again.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Friendly Football Match Donghua Wins Against the British Army 丨Five to Two丨</h3>
<p>The Donghua Football Team has made some changes in its lineup this year in preparation for winning the championship, so it has stepped up its training. Yesterday afternoon, it specially invited the British Army stationed in Shanghai to play a friendly match. The Army was represented by the Survey Team. As a result, Donghua won by a large margin of five to two. The referee was Li Silian.</p>
<p>▲New Faces Donghua is actively training new talents to prepare for the gap between generations. Yesterday's forwards included several players from Shanghai and the masters of small ball games. Their performance was not bad, but they lacked experience and their movements were still slow. They missed several opportunities to shoot at the goal and lacked cooperation. They only knew how to rush forward and lacked communication. With more training, they should be able to improve. The opponent was a Group B team. The goalkeeper and the defense were good, and the right winger was the most stable.</p>
<p>▲First Half The strength of the British army was mediocre, so the difference in strength was immediately apparent. For the first 15 minutes of the match, neither side established a lead. Xiao Hu Cao Qiuting and right winger Jia Youliang were very familiar with each other from their small ball days, so their connection yesterday was very active. After Yuan Qingwu missed twice, Jia Youliang launched a long shot from the eastern suburbs. Shi Te was unable to nail it down, and Hai Fute tried to be clever but shot himself in the foot. The ball fell into the middle of the 12-yard area, and Chen Hongguang rushed to it immediately and kicked it in, opening the scoring. From then on, the Donghua flag could be seen everywhere on the British army's territory. Xu Jingcheng and Hongguang constantly probed and probed, making the opponent feel extremely uneasy. Finally, Xiao Jia made a comeback and hooked the ball into the center, with a very good landing point. Chen Hongguang rushed to meet it with his head, and Ximen was distracted and lost another goal. The British army became more and more discouraged after the restart. At the 40th minute, Cao Qiuting reached a heavily defended area, and Hongguang scored another goal. The score at halftime was 4-0.</p>
<p>▲Second Half Donghua saw that getting the ball was as easy as picking something out of a bag, and inevitably became arrogant. Not long after the start of the second half, the three center backs, due to helping the forwards attack, left the defense empty, allowing Shi Te to sneak in, and suddenly broke into the interior. A cross from Huishoulu, who fired a shot from afar, Lu Zhongen was absent-minded and lost a goal. The Chen brothers joined forces in the southern expedition, and Ximen's save was the most exciting scene. Chen Yutian, the desperate Saburo, was a veteran craftsman, and with the help of Dr. Tu, he made great contributions. Before five minutes had passed, Cao Xiaohu and Jia Youliang echoed each other, crossed the center back line, and Qiuting used all his strength to shoot the ball out like an arrow. Ximen failed to save the ball, making it a 5-1 situation. After a long time of melee, the British army center forward Fulun shot in another goal from afar, making it 2-5. The battle ended. The lineups of the two armies are as follows:</p>

<h3>Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation Football League Schedule</h3>
<p>▲A Total of Nine Schools Will Participate on the 15th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Secondary School Sports Federation organized the Secondary School Football Championship League. Since the start of the report, a total of nine schools have participated in this year's league as of the previous day. Zhang Xien (Chairman), Jiang Jingnan, Han Kuiyong, (Lu Xiangqian's representative) of the Football Committee of the Association held a meeting at the Sports Association yesterday afternoon to discuss the competition rules of this year's football competition and draw up the competition schedule. The resolutions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Competition Dates The competition will start on the 15th of this month and end on the 20th of next month. Every Wednesday at 2:30 pm, the competition will be held in rotation at each school. That is, if the competition was held in School A last year, it will be held in School B this year. Any team that fails to appear for the competition within 15 minutes of the start will be considered to have forfeited the match. (This does not apply if the delay is caused by unforeseen circumstances en route.)</p>
<p>(2) Group Competition In order to facilitate the competition and save time, the nine participating schools will be divided into two groups, "Zhong" and "Ti". The "Zhong" group includes Daxia, Chizhi, Minli, Fuzhong, and Pudong, a total of five schools. The "Ti" group includes Guanghua, Jinan, Yuqing, and Fushi, a total of four schools.</p>
<p>(3) Competition System Both groups will adopt a single round-robin competition system. The winner will get two points, the loser will get zero points, and a draw will get one point each. The teams with the most points in the two groups will then hold a final to determine the championship.</p>
<p>(4) Competition Rules The football rules set by the National Games will be implemented in full. However, the competition time will be changed to 70 minutes (35 minutes for each half) with a 10-minute break. The competition time for the final will also be handled in the same way.</p>
<p>(5) Referees The referees will be hired by the home team with the consent of the visiting team. The linesmen will be appointed by each side. The referees and linesmen for the final will be hired by the Chairman of the Football Committee.</p>
<p>(6) Postponement of Competition 1. If it rains or the ground is wet, the two sides will jointly select a date for the makeup match. 2. If a postponement is requested due to special circumstances, the Chairman of the Committee must be notified five days in advance. If the Chairman of the Committee deems that there are sufficient reasons after reviewing, the makeup match date may be negotiated with the other party, but the makeup match must be completed before December 20.</p>
<p>(7) Player List The player list of each team must be sent to the Football Chairman Zhang Xien (Chizhi Affiliated Middle School, Kunshan Road) before the 15th of this month for verification. When each school competes, it must still submit the list of players of the team to the referee. After the referee signs it, the home team will be responsible for reporting the results of the competition to the Football Chairman Zhang Xien (within two days), otherwise, it will be regarded as a waiver.

<h3>New Village</h3>
<p>—Yanqiao</p>
<p>I often hear people say that to improve the lives of farmers and increase their welfare, we must build new villages. But in reality, I have not seen any new village that is sufficient to achieve this extravagant hope. The Good Samaritan Bridge in Suzhou has a new village, which is being planned and is in progress, but it is not yet mature. But I heard from someone who had been there that they are now using all their strength in education, and have no time for other constructions, and without a solid educational foundation, even if there are tall and magnificent buildings, they will soon collapse. Therefore, the construction of a new village is a meticulous task, like an old woman cutting the bottom of a sock, and it cannot be accomplished by large-scale, careless, and impetuous planning.</p>
<p>The day before yesterday, the education community of Wujiang visited Xugong Bridge in Kunshan and outside the West Gate of Wuxi and came back. They told me that the glimpse of Xugong Bridge gave them an impression that "there are no idle people in the village, and no waste on the road." It is said that even the police in the police station are so free that they have nothing to police. As for the most common gambling and opium, they are absolutely not allowed to stay within dozens of miles. An unknown opium peddler was driven out of the country. I ask, do other rural areas have this impression? Outside the West Gate of Wuxi is a world of thatched huts. Those coolies are struggling to feed themselves, let alone recognize characters and read books. At first, the educators were exhausted, but they still turned a blind eye, and it was rare for a few to come and join in the fun for a few minutes. Later, they implemented Lu Dianhu's thatched pavilion lecture from the past, and built a slightly scientific thatched hut in the group of thatched huts. The educators lived there, met them day and night, and then taught them after they finished their work. On the one hand, they also jointly run a nursery with the leaders of the factory, so that each has a place to go. In less than a year, the atmosphere has been completely new. When they went to visit that day, it was still early, and they did not see the teaching, but there were two rickshaw pullers playing chess there. It is said that they originally did not recognize a single character, but now they can read slogans.</p>
<p>In the city, we often see children from wealthy families who study carelessly. No matter how earnestly you speak, they not only ignore you, but even want to argue with you. It is better to go to reclaim wasteland, and get as much harvest as you put in effort.</p>
<h3>Liquor Money and "Come-See"</h3>
<p>— Shi Chun</p>
<p>Some people say that today's society is completely a society of money, where everything is about monetary transactions. This is certainly true, especially in big cities. Going out to do anything requires spending money that disappears without a trace. If you use the very fashionable term "come-see" (some call it "compson" in pidgin English, actually a mispronunciation of "come-see," meaning kickback, but in Shanghai, it's used as a general term for tips), or if you don't want to sound so fancy, you call it "liquor money."</p>
<p>I remember the first time I traveled. When I got on the train, the porter asked me for liquor money because I had some luggage. I was young at the time and asked him how much liquor he wanted to drink. The relative traveling with me laughed so hard he bent over. Later, I learned that liquor money wasn't really for buying liquor. But the origin of the term "liquor money" remains unknown to me. What's strange is that in Germany, there's also the term "Trinkgeld," which is similar. However, in the United States or England, it's called "Tip," which is different from Germany. Japan doesn't have the bad habit of liquor money at all, so there's no such term, which is much more convenient.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the amount spent on liquor money during festivals is considerable. Starting from home, street sweepers, toilet cleaners, lane managers, watchmen, and policemen guarding the lanes all line up with outstretched hands to ask for money. In winter, there are even people on the streets shouting about fire safety. The amount ranges from a few copper coins for the cheap ones to silver dollars for the expensive ones. You have to take care of them during every festival, it is even more important than owing a debt. Working in a business is even worse. From the errand boy in the shop to the tea server, to the elevator operator and doorman, everyone wants liquor money. If you give too little, they'll curse you behind your back, roll their eyes at you. The situation when no liquor money is given is self-evident.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, it's even easier to encounter liquor money demands. An employee from the water company only needs to touch your water pipe to ask for liquor money. An electrician who fixes your fuse box will ask for at least twenty cents for liquor money. There are countless other places where money is spent on liquor, too many to list.</p>
<p>Once, a postman came to my house to ask for liquor money. I gave him a bottle of sorghum wine and told him he didn't need to ask for money to buy it, just take the bottle. He knew I was making fun of him, and that postmen asking for liquor money was against postal regulations, so he left without a word. But later, I couldn't help but regret it, because I knew he must have been cursing me behind my back with vulgar words.</p>
<p>When I was a student, I had to pay several dollars in liquor money every semester. The tea server and the doorman had to be paid. If you went out for a snack, you had to pay liquor money in addition to the tip. Double the expense! On a ship, the liquor money on the Ningbo steamer was even more than the fare, which was alarming, and shows the prevalence of this social bad habit.</p>
<h3>### Suzhou to Hold Fish and Chrysanthemum Show</h3>
<p>— Yu Chi (Fish Addict)</p>
<p>Suzhou is a place that people colloquially call "xie yi chang hua" (a place where people can relax and enjoy life). Friends who live there like to study raising fish, growing bamboo, cultivating orchids, and planting chrysanthemums. Moreover, it is a public entertainment area. Therefore, there are many goldfish and chrysanthemums cultivated there. Every year, when the autumn sky is clear and the air is crisp, they will definitely collect the privately produced goldfish and chrysanthemums, gather them together, and hold a fish and chrysanthemum exhibition to embellish this autumn scenery. On the one hand, it can arouse the interest of tourists, and on the other hand, it can also compete for the achievements of each family. During the days of the exhibition, ladies and gentlemen gather, causing a sensation throughout the city. I remember that when last year's fish and chrysanthemum exhibition was held, it also attracted many people from the Shanghai literary and art circles to visit, which shows the value of this exhibition. This year, the park management director, Mr. Fan Yunshu, in order to increase the interest of tourists, in addition to collecting the local private famous products, also invited Shanghai's "Yu Le Guo Goldfish Garden" to participate in the event. Yu Le Guo is a large-scale organized goldfish garden, with countless rare and famous species. It is said that many rare species that are rarely seen outside will be transported to Suzhou to participate, which can also allow viewers to increase their knowledge. Now, the exhibition period of the Fish and Chrysanthemum Exhibition has been set to be held in Suzhou Wusa Road Park for three days starting from the tenth of this month. If any individual in Shanghai is willing to send products for display, they can contact Mr. Wu Jiren at the Mingxing Film Company on Xipushi Road, French Concession, Shanghai, which is the most welcome at the exhibition.</p>
<h3>The Fever for Getting Rich, The Belief in Numerology, and The Craving for Laziness</h3>
<p>— Fei Wenbao</p>
<p>In recent years, the situation has been unclear, the countryside has gone bankrupt, and the social economy has shown signs of collapse. The general public, feeling that income does not meet expenses, harbors a fluke mentality of speculation, those who think about getting rich every day are called fever for getting rich; those who blindly believe in numerology are called the belief in numerology; and those who dream of gold falling from the sky, without labor and gain are called the craving for laziness. These three types of people together constitute the fever for getting rich, the belief in numerology, and the craving for laziness, which are composed into a simple tune, 435323, which is the same as the winning lottery number of this air lottery, is it not strange? (Que Chou)</p>
<h3>Postscript to Cheng Yanqiu's Wonderful Double Meeting</h3>
<p>— Qi Sheng</p>
<p>Cheng Yanqiu went to Europe to study drama, which lasted for a year and a half. After returning to China in August, he returned to the stage, and there were many improvements. Last week, he was hired by the Nanjing Fund-raising Committee for the Yellow River Flood Disaster to perform two days of charity performances at the Lizhi Society. The ticket prices were divided into three grades of ten yuan, five yuan, and three yuan. Every day was full, which shows the enthusiasm of his social popularity. I listened to his wonderful double meeting on the second night. The beauty of his appearance was as good as before, and his voice was clearer and more melodious than it was two years ago. His expression was delicate and appropriate, and the details were exquisite. The wonderful thing is that he can put himself in the role and the emotions are consistent with the ancients. It can be said that the sorrow is touching, and the art has reached a wonderful realm. The reader can guess who is playing his husband, Zhao Chong. It is not Jiang Miaoxiang, but the Red Bean Hall Master who has not been on stage for a long time. The Hall Master is nearly sixty years old. Because he plays the role of a young student, he shaved off his beard, and it became the bare and treeless Niu Mountain. Once he put on makeup, his demeanor was elegant, and he was still like a young man of the Five Tombs, with a natural and noble grace, which is difficult to learn by human power. As for his gestures and movements, they all have laws and standards, and there is a wonderful effect of success. It is said that he has obtained the true inheritance of the famous young student Wang Guiguan, and his skills have also reached the point of perfection, with no trace of human fireworks. Seeing this, I know that the wonderfulness of the old drama art is incredible. When watching the wonderful realm, thousands of people in the audience, regardless of whether they are insiders or outsiders, all rejoiced and praised. Listening to his pronunciation, it is also unusually exquisite. The Hall Master is talented and versatile, enough to add color to the world of amateur opera, but it is a pity that it is limited by space and cannot be discussed in detail. There is an interesting story in this play. When Yanqiu took the complaint and went off the stage, he touched the chin of the Hall Master with his hand, and the audience smiled. The joy of the boudoir is greater than painting eyebrows, is this what it means?</p>
<h3>Four Company Commanders of the Northeast</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 18 Whispering Tea Conveys Sorrow to Comfort Her Husband, Suddenly Leaving the Border with a Forced Smile to Say Goodbye to Her Family</p>
<p>Qizhi followed her into the house and placed a handkerchief on the tea table. Jiang, taking advantage of his inattention, pinched the handkerchief, as if it had been washed in water. Therefore, she dared not speak. Zhao Ziqiang stood in the courtyard, also thinking that when the mother and daughter met, there would surely be a bout of sorrow. So he stood outside and waited for a while. But after standing for a long time, he heard no sound, thinking that nothing was wrong. So he went to the backyard. Zhao Weng, with his hands behind his back, was pacing slowly back and forth on the corridor. So he said to Zhao Ziqiang: You came back late enough, shouldn't you return to camp? Zhao Ziqiang stood up straight and said to Zhao Weng: Do you, old man, have anything else to say to me? Zhao Weng was originally walking with his hands behind his back when he spoke. At this time, he stopped and suddenly turned his head to look at Zhao Ziqiang's face for a while. Then he touched his beard, as if he had a breath to sigh out. But when he raised his head and rolled his eyes, he held the words back again. Zhao Ziqiang saw that his father did not speak, and could not force his father to speak. So he said in a low voice: This matter is really very unfortunate. But people who are soldiers have the possibility of leaving every day. So it is a matter of course to get a command temporarily and leave temporarily. As he said this, he looked at his father, but could not continue to speak, slowly lowering his hands, and slowly lowering his eyelids. Zhao Weng put his hands in his sleeves, tilted his head slightly and looked at his son. After a long time, he suddenly straightened his face and said: Since it is time for you to return to camp, you should go, what are you doing wasting time here? I... I... He paused and said: I have nothing to say. Go! As he spoke, he did not take out his hands that were in his sleeves, but moved them up and down, as if he was making a bow to his son. But his old eyes were filled with tears, rolling in his eyes, almost flowing out. (235)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>One Morning (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Gu Mingdao</p>
<p>"Dark-skinned, healthy country girls... a flock of white geese... brown old cows... farmers with chestnut flesh on their rolled-up sleeves, backs, and legs... people pedaling waterwheels under the scorching sun... no three-dimensional buildings... no grand mansions... no melodious Cantonese opera... no women with red lips, long eyebrows, white faces, and high-heeled shoes..." All of this swirled in Ping's mind as he came to his uncle's house in the countryside to escape the summer heat. Although he was sitting under an old willow tree by a lake with his cousin Jin Fu, fishing, his attention was long gone from the fishing rod.</p>
<p>"What are you thinking about?" Jin Fu turned his head and asked.</p>
<p>"Nothing." Ping smiled, moved the fishing rod in his hand, indicating that he was trying to perk up. "I think everything in the countryside is strange. Things you can't see in the city, you can see here. Things you're used to seeing in the city, it's the opposite here."</p>
<p>"The city is fun, right? You're not used to living in the countryside, right?"</p>
<p>"Not necessarily, but I think the farmers are too poor."</p>
<p>"How do you know?"</p>
<p>"Oh, they work in the sun in such hot weather, and the reward they get is too small."</p>
<p>"Reward?" Jin Fu seemed not to understand.</p>
<p>"That is, what they deserve to maintain their lives, such as food, drink, clothing, housing, etc..." Ping said with a smile.</p>
<p>"They are just farmers who grow fields!" Jin Fu thought his cousin was mistaken.</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew, stirring up the water. Ping thought there were fish and quickly pulled up the fishing rod, but he knew that it was just seaweed. He said disappointedly,</p>
<p>"Let's go back and eat watermelon!"</p>
<p>Ping's aunt, who ate vegetarian food and chanted Buddhist scriptures in the summer, heard her son Jin Fu say how Ping sympathized with the farmers, and said,</p>
<p>"Amitabha, Ping is really compassionate."</p>
<p>"Young master, the newspaper is here." A barefoot little maid brought in a copy of the "local newspaper."</p>
<p>"This local newspaper is not late, how do they deliver it?"</p>
<p>"They walk here every day."</p>
<p>"Walk here. How far is it?"</p>
<p>"More than ten li!" Jin Fu said, "You probably think he's pitiful too!"</p>
<p>"No, not really, I was just asking."</p>
<p>His uncle was a landlord, so naturally everything in the house was very beautiful. Jin Fu told the maid to cut two watermelons, and opened the Dianhua (radio).</p>
<p>Ping lay on the sofa, looking at the newspaper and listening to Wang Renmei's "The Flower of Love" and the violin solo that would make you cry that were being broadcast on the radio.</p>
<p>"Dianhua... sofa... electric fan... watermelon... refrigerator... cold food..." Naturally, everything was available in the landlord's house. Ping thought, "Wild rose-like, healthy dark-skinned girls... white geese... old cows... men in blue cloth shirts with chestnut flesh... workers under the scorching sun..." It came again, mixed up in his mind again. He knew that what was done in the movies was just acting. He seemed to understand that these people lived a life that movie stars didn't.</p>
<p>There was a storm in his clothes.</p>
<p>The morning was much cooler. Ping went to the lake early in the morning to enjoy this rural morning. The color of the mountains, the light of the water, the green fields, and the towering old trees, children wearing only a pair of pants leading cows to graze. These were things that Ping did not often see in the city. The wild children looked at him face to face, and even the dogs barked at him.</p>

<h3>Searching for Living Vocabulary in Ancient Books</h3>
<p>— Luo Wu</p>
<p>Searching for living vocabulary in ancient books is something that can be said but not done. He cannot find a living vocabulary in those ancient books.</p>
<p>Suppose there are "young people who can read 'Wen Xuan'" here, just a few high school students. He opens "Wen Xuan" and is determined to find a living vocabulary. Of course, he knows that some words are already dead. However, how does he distinguish which words are dead and alive? Probably only by whether he understands them or not. However, words that are understood only after reading the annotations of the Six Ministers cannot be counted, because this is originally a dead body, carried into his brain by the Six Ministers. This is only considered a living person. Even if it is resurrected in his brain, it is still a dead thing in the eyes of "young people who cannot read 'Wen Xuan'." So he must read the plain text.</p>
<p>Indeed, there are also some that can be understood without reading the annotations. This is a living vocabulary. However, how would he understand it in the first place? This must be because he has seen it in other books, or it is a vocabulary that is still in use now, so he understands it. So, what did he find from a "Wen Xuan"?</p>
<p>However, Mr. Shi said that it is useful when describing palaces and the like. This is very good. There are many fu in "Wen Xuan" that talk about palaces, and there are also special fu for what palace. If a young person wants to write a historical novel of the Han and Jin dynasties, describing the palaces of that time, it is extremely appropriate to look for "Wen Xuan", and it is also necessary to look at "The Four Histories", "The Book of Jin" and the like. However, the remote characters taken are only raising the dead bodies, and calling them "resurrection" when speaking mysteriously. If what is to be described is the Qing Forbidden City, then the relationship with "Wen Xuan" is extremely small.</p>
<p>If even the Qing Forbidden City is not wanted to be described, but the preparatory work is used so extensively, then it is really in vain and still insufficient. Because there are also "The Book of Changes" and "The Book of Rites". The vocabulary inside is useful when describing the divination lessons and weddings and funerals of the Zhou Dynasty, and it must also be used as the basis of literary cultivation, which is more like the appearance of a "literary youth".</p>
<h3>Talking About Tobacco and Opium Again</h3>
<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>I have already written an article on "Tobacco and Opium", and now there are things that can be continued. Wang Fuzhi's Chuanshan Poems Collection has a poem about poppy:</p>
<p>Petite head drooping, full and graceful face.</p>
<p>Flower king should not be jealous, I do not bloom in spring.</p>
<p>There is also a sentence in the Miscellaneous Yong Four Quatrains: "Poppy seedlings are light and green, and the petals are delicate." Using poppies as an ornamental flower is seen again in Wang's poems. I think that during the Ming Dynasty, Wang was not the only one who planted this flower, nor was it limited to Hunan. In the middle of the Ming Dynasty, the emperor did not meet with his ministers often. During the Wanli period, Emperor Shenzong lived in seclusion for twenty years and never met with ministers. If he was misled by opium addiction, then poppies should be blamed for the fall of the Ming Dynasty. However, it is suspected that what was taken in the palace at that time were all goods from various countries in Nanyang, not produced in China.</p>
<p>Tobacco addiction also began in the Ming Dynasty. Wang Hong's Pillow Worm Small Talk said that "Tobacco leaves come from Fujian. People in the borderlands cannot cure cold diseases without this. Outside the Pass, they even exchange a horse for a jin. During the Chongzhen period, an order was issued to ban it, but there were still many private growers among the people. The profit was high and the law was light, and the people disobeyed the ban as before. Soon, an order was issued that those who violated it would be beheaded. However, not long after, the ban was lifted because the army could not cure cold diseases. When I was a child, I still did not know what tobacco was. At the end of Chongzhen, children as young as three feet old smoked tobacco." See the reference in Gai Yu Cong Kao. Smoking tobacco was also punishable by beheading. No wonder it was later forbidden to smoke opium, which had to be threatened with the death penalty.</p>
<h3>Going to the Market</h3>
<p>— Sheng Huanming</p>
<p>At the market, people shouted in high-pitched voices, and it was extremely lively and noisy. But very few people carried "zha ma dai" (Note), or carried light "luo dan" to the market specifically to buy goods. A chicken, seven or eight pairs of straw sandals, or a dozen eggs were all this kind of small transaction. A young man carried a load of bamboo baskets filled with piglets to the eaves of the "White Horse Temple" to rest. He wiped the sweat from his forehead, opened his jacket, used a "liang mao" to fan himself, concentrating, savoring the fatigue given by hard work and stuffiness.</p>
<p>"How much are you willing to pay? Eighteen? The salt shop wants to sell for twenty-four! Okay, I'll sell it to you at a loss, hey! Pay back eighteen..." The "private salt" seller shouted straight up his throat to a middle-aged man who was holding a hen upside down. The hen holder only turned his head and did not stop his feet.</p>
<p>"Hey, how about it? Isn't it okay for you to pay eighteen coins?"</p>
<p>"...Oh! Wait for me to sell the chicken and come back to buy it."</p>
<p>"..." The private salt seller was stunned, "Cao!" He slumped down and put down the scale.</p>
<p>The goods in the market seemed to be particularly cheap in the abstract: straw sandals were four copper coins a pair: eggs were thirty-five copper coins a dime. In this busy season, everyone plans to sell their goods a little cheaper as soon as possible, and buy some necessary things and rush home early. But there are still not many people who want to buy, not really not wanting to: most people have to sell their goods first before they can buy goods.</p>
<p>In the past, when market day came, those selling plaster for bruises, fortune-telling, making "leper grabbing relatives" wooden puppet shows, and monkey performers could be seen everywhere in the market. But in recent years, they have almost disappeared. There was only one load of wooden puppet shows in such a large market. The "Shandong people" hid in the tent, blowing squeaky sounds with their mouths, and two lepers bumped their heads against each other on the wooden puppet stage, but this was obviously no longer able to attract those who were willing to pay copper coins.</p>
<p>The sky suddenly covered with haze again, and misty drizzle diffused down from the gray sky. The prices of goods fell: eggs were three copper coins each, and piglets under the eaves of the "White Horse Temple" were only selling for two yuan and fifty cents each.</p>
<p>"Really cheap! These piglets are probably raised for a month or so!" Some people said that, but no one talked about buying them.</p>
<p>Many people have changed their trading methods: for example, a lunch basket is exchanged for three catties of rice, and one catty of rice is exchanged for three pairs of straw sandals...</p>
<p>"Cooked beef is one dollar and five jins, guests, take some back for a drink!" The beef stall owner yawned as he raised the meat knife.</p>
<p>The "Shandong people" who made wooden puppet shows spent four copper coins to buy a large piece of beef tendon, carrying the wooden puppet show frame, humming "The third girl is beautiful and charming, ah yo, those little feet..." step by step, leaving this market on the "official road" that was muddied by the plum rain.</p>
<p>Dusk crawled out, and this market was old.</p>
<p>(Note) Zha ma dai: A kind of bag used by people in the countryside to store money and sundries.</p>
<h3>Jews</h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>When I was compiling a small book on the Jewish question for the Current Affairs Problem Series of the Life Bookstore, I first encountered difficulties with the materials. This difficulty was not due to a lack of materials, as there were many books and newspapers in Japan discussing it. However, I felt that all their discussions were useless, because these materials were all based on Anti-Semitism, deliberately fabricated, and used to insult Jews with rumors that were almost entirely unreliable. This is not surprising. Japan, which always follows Germany in everything, would naturally not disagree with Hitler's policies. Therefore, Lieutenant General Shikotenno Nobutaka publicly declared: "In order to protect the national polity and history of the Japanese Empire, and for the sake of the eternal Heaven and Earth and the everlasting Imperial Throne, we must repel them (Jews)." Because Jews are "spies" who "evilly use the capitalism they created to destroy political and economic institutions," and "hold the sword of socialism and communism to carry out movements to destroy national organizations."</p>
<p>However, I cannot see what harm these "spies" have done to our Republic of China's "national polity," "history," "Heaven and Earth," and "everlasting Imperial Throne." Therefore, I have no obligation to "repel" them. Moreover, what the editor of the Current Affairs Problem Series wanted me to describe was the real face of the Jews, but unfortunately, there were too few materials on this aspect.</p>
<p>My little book was finally barely compiled. Because there were too few true materials, the content was naturally not very substantial. But fortunately, there were still several reliable Western books and newspapers that allowed me to provide a general explanation of several important issues; and what I am most comforted by is that I have not said anything to distort or insult the Jews.</p>
<p>But what I regret most is that at the time of compilation, I forgot an important article, namely, Hakukawa Shiratsuki's "Why the Insult," which was included in Going to the Crossroads. This article defends the Jews and is extremely stern and righteous. In addition to listing the amazing achievements of Jews in culture, he also provides the following explanation for the greed of Jews, which is most despised by the world:</p>
<p>"The majority of Jews have no choice but to rely on the power of money as the only impregnable wall to ensure their own safety. Because if they do not rely on this, even their right to survival will be endangered. In certain periods of the European Middle Ages, it was clear that Jews were strictly prohibited from owning land, and noble professions were also closed to them. As a result, they had no choice but to save money, greedily collect interest, and barely survive in order to assert their right to survival. Therefore, over time, many greedy and stingy people were born, which is also a phenomenon worthy of sympathy. Are not the Christians who persecuted them to this point hateful and blameworthy?"</p>
<p>Dr. Hakukawa also predicted long ago that the Japanese would also repel Jews. He said:</p>
<p>"Thinking carefully, the fact that even Japan is paying attention to the Jewish question, which has never been involved until now, is indeed because Japan has become a world-class Japan. We should be happy! There is no need to worry about anything! In this era when the French occupation of the Ruhr immediately affects the market price of iron and dyes in Japan, this matter may be a matter of course. In the future, Japan will also hear extremely strange Anti-Semitism voices."</p>
<p>Japan is like this, what about China? The Jewish question is a long-standing question, but we have never paid attention to it, let alone since Hitler came to power and put great pressure on the Jews, making this question more serious, our people are still not without any sense of the situation. What is the reason for this silence?</p>
<p>Broite said: "In Japan and China, because the indigenous bourgeoisie do not have conflicts of interest with the Jews, there is no anti-Semitism." Let this be the reason why the Chinese do not throw stones down the well at the Jews, although Japan has anti-Jewish movements due to the prevalence of Fascism. However, why is there not even one person who speaks up for the Jews?</p>
<p>Perhaps, this is because the Chinese are too self-aware, because they know that their fate is the same as that of the Jews, and even worse than the Jews. If they rashly express sympathy for the Jews, they are afraid of being laughed at, and therefore remain silent?</p>
<p>In fact, the Chinese are indeed far behind the Jews. More than two thousand years after losing their homeland, the Jews can still maintain their national language and make great contributions to mankind in culture; and they occupy a great influence in modern capitalist and socialist activities; and the restoration movement is also unyielding.</p>
<p>However, the Jewish restoration movement still has many problems after all. Professor Van Loon has such a passage in his book "Our World":</p>
<p>"If the Jews themselves knew what to do with their old homeland, things would be much simpler. Today, the general orthodox Jews in Eastern Europe, especially in Russia, advocate maintaining its current state, that is, treating it as a huge seminary with a small museum for collecting Hebrew antiquities. As for the older generation, they all remember the famous saying of the prophets, "Let the dead bury the dead," and feel that weeping for the past glory can hinder the glory of the future, so they all hope to build Palestine into a proper modern country like Switzerland or Denmark, and from then on, everyone will forget everything in the past and stop fighting with the Arabs for a few meaningless stones, but focus on road construction and river dredging."</p>
<p>This passage is good to offer to the Jews, and it is especially useful to offer to Chinese youth. However, if it is slightly misinterpreted, the danger is also very great.</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (23)</h3>
<p>— Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>Old Man Roland shrugged his shoulders and said:</p>
<p>"Ah, ah, the life of the wisest man is to live it comfortably. We are not cattle and horses, but human beings. If we are born poor, then we should work! What can we do, we just have to work. But since we have income from property interest, haha, then it would be extremely stupid for people to work hard."</p>
<p>Pierre proudly replied:</p>
<p>"Our tendencies are different! As for me, I only respect learning and reason in everything in the world, and I don't bother with the rest."</p>
<p>Mrs. Roland always tried her best to ease the constant conflict between father and son; so she changed the subject and talked about a murder case that happened last week in Borberclo Antoine. Everyone immediately paid attention to the case, and felt a keen interest in the interesting and terrible situation, and the moving secrets of the crime. Even if this crime is vulgar, shameful, and hateful, it can still give mankind's curiosity a strange and universal temptation.</p>
<p>But Old Man Roland still took out his watch to look at it from time to time, saying:</p>
<p>"Hurry up, we're about to leave."</p>
<p>Pierre laughed and said:</p>
<p>"It's not even one o'clock yet. Really, there's really no need to make me eat a cold pork chop."</p>
<p>"Are you going to the notary too?" his mother asked him.</p>
<p>He replied bluntly:</p>
<p>"Me? No, what am I going to do? There's no need for me to go to this."</p>
<p>Zhe An didn't say a word, as if it had nothing to do with him at all. When they were talking about the murder case in Borberclo, he had expressed some opinions from the perspective of a jurist, and made a few observations about crime and criminals. Now, he didn't say another word, but the radiance in his eyes, the lively red color on his cheeks, and the glowing beard, seemed to be announcing his happiness.</p>
<p>After the family left, Pierre, who was left alone again, continued his work of finding a house in the morning. After running up and down the stairs for two or three hours, he finally found a beautiful house on Frank Shah I Street: This was a tall Entreso (a house between the basement and the first floor), with two doors leading to two different streets, two living rooms, a glass corridor, where patients could wait for their examination while walking around the decorated flowers, and another exquisite circular dining room with a view of the sea.</p>

<h3>Securities Public Bonds Were More Lively in the Morning</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was not as sluggish as the previous day, but there were only fluctuations in the first half of the day. It was rumored that a new salt tax treasury bond of 120 million yuan would be issued, and the old matter was brought up again. Although this kind of rumor is still far from the truth, the lack of confidence in people's hearts has been shaken, and the bulls have slightly emerged, and the market price has immediately seen a small decline. Because both the bulls and the bears are eager to settle, the market price has fallen back slightly, and there is still a compensation, so it will not cause a huge wave. When the market opened yesterday morning, the purchase price of the demobilization and disarmament number 4 was slightly higher by 1 jiao and a half. After entering, scattered sales were quite surging, and the market gradually became weak. The multi-party declined sharply by half a yuan, and the far-term positive 6 and special declined by as much as 8 jiao, but it was an abnormal shape and not a formal trend. In the second session, the various previous items continued to weaken, and the unified salt tax was stable. The positive 6 rose back by more than half a yuan. When the market opened in the afternoon, it seemed to be more than one or two jiao more walled, because the transaction was idle and no yuan entered. The closing transaction was even more clear, and the market price was also chaotic, hovering only. According to the trend, it may be small first and then large, but its strength is still not easy to grasp. As a result of the market price throughout the day, most of them fell by two or three jiao, but the far-term of 19 fell by 5 jiao, and the gold short and gold long were still good by two or three jiao. The total transaction volume was 6,067,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods and 2,540,000 yuan in futures unified salt tax, 675,000 yuan in demobilization and disarmament, 655,000 yuan in 19 and good, 1,065,000 yuan in 20 and 20, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to more than 100,000.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Indian Cotton Pricing is Cheaper, and the Decline of the Standard Cotton is Gradually Becoming Powerful</h3>
<p>The cotton market is quite weak, and the decline is getting stronger. The image of instability appears every day. Because the Indian cotton is falling and the exchange rate is rising, the estimated price is getting cheaper and cheaper. The business intention of Japanese merchants is stagnant, so the bulls are gradually settled, and the market is relaxed as a result. However, some bulls have high intentions, and the world situation is extremely weak. The estimate of American cotton is about 1 million bales, and the future is still difficult to stabilize.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Bulls Return Out</h3>
<p>When Zheng Standard opened in the previous market, although the American cotton was closed, the Indian cotton continued to fall by 2 rupees and 75, and the selling atmosphere in the market was fierce again. The prices of each month fell by 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao. In the afternoon, it was heard that the pricing of Indian cotton was even cheaper, which made people even more flustered, and the prices of each month fell by 1 jiao and a half to 2 jiao and a half. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 86,300 dan. It was found that Ruidabai sold 8,900 dan, Chongan 6,900 dan, Chunjibai 6,400 dan, Yongdabai 1,600 dan, Tongfu 2,400 dan, Yuandabai 1,600 dan, and Xinheng 1,500 dan. Yuande bought 4,600 dan, Renfeng 3,600 dan, Tongxing 4,500 dan, Dafu 1,800 dan, Suilong 1,600 dan, and Yukang 1,800 dan. The closing price is as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Price Increase or Decrease Number of Accounts Zheng Standard Closing Price Increase or Decrease Number of Accounts</p>
<p>November 4055 Down 40 193,200 February 4040 Down 35 186,300</p>
<p>December 4040 35 196,600 March 4065 40 88,400</p>
<p>January 4040 40 186,900 April 4080 35 17,500</p>
<p>Total 848,900</p>
<h3>Factory Needs Are Completely Stalled</h3>
<p>The current cotton business has completely stalled. Because Indian cotton is being sold at a relatively cheap price in the market, the factories dare not accept it rashly because the yarn sales are sluggish. The source is 3,510 bales of Xin Yao cotton and 1,200 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<h3>The Sales of Spot Yarn Are Still Clear The Standard Yarn Will Be Decided to Be Auctioned Today An Additional Deposit of 22 Yuan Is Required</h3>
<p>The human standard futures yarn market continues to be closed. The Brokers Association and the Board of Directors have convened major meetings at 4 pm, but the results and contents are kept secret. The sales of spot yarn are relatively clear. Because the situation of the world cotton industry is declining day by day, the market is depressed, and the future situation is lack of confidence. When the reporter sent the manuscript, he received the latest news, saying that there is a mitigating method and the auction will be decided to be held tomorrow (9th), but both the bulls and the bears must pay a certificate deposit of 22 yuan per 100 bales. According to statistics, only 333 bales were bought by the current yarn customer gangs. The market is flat and tired. The purchase amount of each gang is listed below:</p>
<p>Guangdong 25 Mainland 207 Nanjing 5 Jiangxi 25</p>
<p>Shantou 8 Zhenjiang 10 Wenzhou 3 Yunnan 40</p>
<p>Xiamen 5 Peers 5</p>
<h3>American Cotton Closed, British and Indian Cotton Flat and Tired</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was closed due to the election of the mayor of New York. The spot price of Liverpool cotton fell by 5 points, the futures were firm and the Indian price was flat, the spot price of Egyptian cotton fell by 7 points, the Mumbai cotton market rose at the beginning because several European exporters slightly bought in, and then fell due to the settlement of bulls, and the result was a drop of 1 rupee and 7.5 jiao in Jiaer, a drop of 1 rupee in Aomula, and a drop of 2 rupees and 2.5 jiao in Bairoxi. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 7th).</p>
<p>British Cotton Compared to the Previous Day Converted into National Currency</p>

<p>Bairoxi 185.00 Down 2.25 36.60</p>
<h3>Grain Flour Market Rose Again Recently</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market continued to expand, and the recent period was particularly strong. Because the factories have not continued to order foreign wheat for many days, there is no longer a large amount of standard sets, and the actual sales in Beiyang, Nanyang, and Northeast have been removed, and there are inquiries for actual sales to handle spot goods. Because the current month can directly draw spot flour, they are very keen to take the current month's standard. Floating air to capture, scattered multi-absorption, the factory also recovered the chips in this month, so the opening price rose. It was once decreased by the long side in the afternoon, but the result was recovered by the passenger factory and rose again. Finally, the closing price of this month was two points lower, the next month was one and a half points higher, the December was seven and a half points higher, the March was two and a half points higher, and the April was two and a half points lower, because there was a factory out.</p>
<h3>Before the Arrival of Foreign Wheat, the Standard Wheat Market is Temporarily Optimistic</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat market, the merchants did not come out, and the factory had the intention of inquiring. The bulls were firm and continued to collect. The vacant households in the railing gang made up for it. Although some floating vacant sales were sold, the market was still strong. The market sentiment was unanimously optimistic. It is estimated that before the arrival of spot foreign wheat and the completion of new transactions, the market can stand firm. The closing price of the current month in January and March was one point higher, and the next month in February and April was three points higher. The current wheat Kai Zhenjiang wheat 2,500 bags, priced at 3.72 yuan, was handled by Xinda.</p>
<h3>The Rice Market at Hexia Lacks Progress</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, shipments arrived from over forty sources, totaling 5400 packages. The purchasing power of local shops improved compared to previous days, absorbing approximately 4000 piculs of rice. Consequently, the sluggish market showed signs of recovery. However, overall sentiment remained unstable, resulting in only a general stabilization. Although both Northern and Southern merchants were active in purchasing yesterday, Fujian merchants only bought a little over 100 packages of late rice. Merchants from Yantai and other regions also only bought 7-800 packages. Sales volume slightly decreased. Thus, the prices of late rice varieties like Qingjiao and Sifeng edged closer to the going rate. Prices for japonica varieties like Changshu and Suzhou-Tong, and thick rice varieties like Nangang, remained unchanged. Demand for Du Jian rice was relatively strong, and prices stabilized. Yang Jian sales were slow and sluggish, continuing to decline slightly. Yin Yuanfeng and Yuanjun exhibited the same trend.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, a total of 37-38 boats arrived at Hexia from various routes. Sales were slow in the morning. The market turned around after noon, and large transactions began to occur. Prices for new japonica, Yang, Du, Bu, and Xian rice varieties increased slightly. Yin Bai Yuan also dropped by 10-20 cents. Early rice, thin rice, and passenger Xian rice stabilized, with no fluctuations reported.</p>
<h3>First Batch of Hunan Unpolished Rice and New Rice Arrives in Shanghai ▲ The City Holds 224,885 Packages of Foreign Rice in Storage</h3>
<p>Yesterday's market for foreign passenger Xian rice remained weak due to the suspension of purchasing by passenger merchants. However, cargo owners were no longer willing to sell at low prices as they had done previously. Thus, the market remained generally stable. Due to the cheap prices, there was continued interest from local merchants, and Ningbo merchants also considered purchasing in small quantities. As a result, the market became more stable in the afternoon. The whole market opened with 100 packages of old Hunan machine-milled oil rice, priced at 7.10 yuan, and 200 packages of Wuxi Yangjian rice, priced at 7.75 yuan. 400 packages of recycled Xiaojiao rice were also sold, priced at 7.05 yuan, all purchased by local merchants. Ningbo merchants bought 100 packages of Nanshixiaochangxian rice at 6.35 yuan.</p>
<p>The Hunan old machine-milled oil rice sold yesterday had recently arrived. At the same time, 206 packages of unpolished rice and new rice also arrived, but they had not yet been sold. Oil rice is welcomed by Zhejiang merchants, and merchants from the North are also purchasing it. It is possible that more shipments will continue to arrive.</p>
<p>Regarding the tax on foreign rice, it is rumored that a decision has been made to levy a tax of 2.5 gold units per hundred catties, which, based on current market prices, amounts to 90%. If this is implemented, rice imports will be immediately halted. Currently, the city's total rice inventory, excluding the 24,900+ packages of recycled Xiaojiao rice stored by the Japanese merchants in the Daxing warehouse, is 224,885 packages. This is broken down as follows: 120,060 packages in Yitaixing warehouse, 78,852 packages in Longmao warehouse, 17,100 packages in Qichang warehouse, 8,347 packages in Yuan Yi warehouse, and 526 packages in Zhaoshang Hua warehouse, totaling 224,885 packages.</p>
<h3>High-Quality Soybeans Rise by 4-5 Cents</h3>
<p>The supply of soybeans is indeed abundant, but high-quality soybeans are scarce. Medium-quality soybeans are increasingly weak. Yesterday, various merchants took advantage of the low prices and traded 14-15 cartloads of soybeans. As a result, high-quality soybeans rose by 4-5 cents, while medium and lower-quality soybeans are unlikely to improve in the short term. Jiujiang soybeans are still not favored. Du soybeans are still not available. Sha Huang soybeans are average. Recently, Ningbo merchants have been inquiring about green soybeans. The market is relatively stable.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Dried Lily Flowers Increase by One Yuan Again</h3>
<p>Dried lily flowers have been selling very well for several days, but the supply has not increased. Therefore, merchants are very interested in purchasing them. Prices have been quoted tightly and have become more favorable. Yesterday, the market price increased sharply. Top-quality dried lily flowers opened at 19 yuan, a sharp increase of one yuan. The price increases for medium and lower-quality varieties were similar. If sales remain strong, further price increases are expected.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Overseas Silk Prices Continue to Decline</h3>
<p>▲ Lyon Chinese Silk Plummets Again The price of Chinese silk on the Lyon silk market has struggled to stabilize since the fluctuations in the French exchange rate. Initially, B-grade white filature silk dropped from 80 francs per kilogram to 78.75 francs. Yesterday morning, French firms like Credit Lyonnais received a telegram from Lyon reporting another sharp decline in the price of white filature silk. A-grade opened at only 83.75 francs per kilogram, a decrease of 2.5 francs. B-grade opened at 73.75 francs, a decrease of 5 francs.</p>
<p>▲ Thirty Pieces of Wuxi Raw Silk Arrive in Shanghai Recently, silk mills in Wuxi have been reducing production and shutting down machines due to the sharp decline in silk sales in Europe and America. The amount of Wuxi raw silk transported to Shanghai has decreased daily. Yesterday morning, thirty pieces arrived on the Shanghai-Wuxi passenger train.</p>
<p>▲ Sales of Rayon Remain Sluggish Lately, the exchange rate has been loosened, and the price of rayon has become weaker. Sales remain sluggish. Yesterday, only local silk factories purchased 16 boxes of Red, Blue, and Golden Bell brand immediate delivery goods, priced from 172.25 yuan to 160.75 yuan net.</p>
<p>▲ Sales of Foreign Silk are Unlikely to Improve Recently, overseas silk weaving mills have seen little demand for raw silk and have ample stocks. Chinese merchants are competing to sell their silk, and prices are gradually declining. Electronic transfer prices are increasingly small. European and American firms are all taking a wait-and-see approach. Chinese silk merchants are suffering increasing losses and are taking a passive stance. Sales of silk are unlikely to improve. Yesterday, only ten bales of grey silk and five bales of reeled silk were traded, and prices remained weak.</p>
<h3>Moroccan Tea Market is Sluggish</h3>
<p>According to recent news received by industry insiders, the Moroccan green tea market has suddenly become sluggish. Sales of Japanese green tea have almost completely stopped. Sales of Chinese Lu Zhuang Pingshui Zhenmei pearl tea have also decreased significantly compared to the past. Taking Zhenmei as an example, normal monthly sales are 5-6000 boxes, but currently only 4000 boxes are being sold. In addition, various foreign firms have recently received large shipments of new goods, making the market even more crowded. As a result, the selling price of all teas, except for high-quality varieties which have remained stable, has fallen by 10-20 francs.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Broadcloth Sells Well and Prices Rise</h3>
<p>The popular 1005 broadcloth has recently seen a rapid increase in popularity. After 36 boxes of spot goods were released by De Ji Foreign Firm the other day, the standard public price immediately increased. Because the supply of this fabric has been cut off, and the sales season is in full swing, the wholesale price yesterday was 8.25 yuan across the board. Tailors still need to add more for retail. Because of the popular sale of eighteen two twenty-four color broadcloth, sellers are hoarding goods, and the wholesale price is 8.5 yuan net. Most also require cash payment upon invoicing. It is heard that the price of the 36 boxes released by De Ji Foreign Firm was only 7.6 yuan per yard.</p>
<p>Business Economics (47)</p>
<h3>The Business of Peanuts and Peanut Kernels (Continued)</h3>
<p>— E</p>
<p>Peanuts and peanut kernels are mostly transported from the north. This business should seem to belong to the northern goods industry, but the peanut and peanut kernel business in Shanghai, especially large-scale operations, still belongs to the miscellaneous grains industry. Sometimes the miscellaneous grains industry completely controls it, and the northern goods industry wholesale from them. In addition to the northern goods and miscellaneous grain industries, the local goods industry which also carries fruit also has this peanut and peanut kernel buying and selling wholesale business. Because peanuts are produced in sandy soil, they are naturally a kind of local goods. Also, because their planting shape is similar to various food grains, and they belong to the legume family, it is suitable for the rice, wheat, miscellaneous grains, and land products industries to manage. Furthermore, because they are northern goods, they seem like dried fruit. Hence the northern goods industry manages them. Therefore, the miscellaneous grains, northern goods, and local goods industries each manage them individually. The broker licenses issued by the government in the past also included these items. This is only based on Shanghai. It is not the same outside of Shanghai. For example, rice and grain stores in inland counties have never been seen selling peanuts and peanut kernels. As for the producing areas, many are managed by grain stores.</p>
<p>The source of peanut kernels for the miscellaneous grain industry and the northern goods industry is the same, which is transported by train, ship, and sandboat from the three provinces of Shandong, Henan, and Zhili in the north. The sales routes are not entirely the same. In addition to foreign firms exporting northern goods, both the northern goods and grain industries have transactions, but southern goods, dismantled goods, and tea food stores are exclusively controlled by the northern goods industry. The transaction quantities are small and tight, that is, one bag, two bags, eight bags, or ten bags are all sold wholesale. The grain industry is different. The sales routes are all in whole lots, transactions of eighty or one hundred bags are already rare, mostly calculated by the cartload, or by whole incoming cargo receipt, (when new goods first appear on the market, each lot is also small). The sales routes are foreign firms, oil mills, Guangdong and Fujian merchants, and other passenger merchants, as well as inland areas of this street (that is, wholesale to the northern goods industry). The raw oil produced into finished goods in the producing areas entirely belongs to the rice and grain industry. Passenger ports have resident purchasing staff from the grain industry. Visiting customers in Shanghai also concurrently manage oil bean cake and miscellaneous grains. Before the development of trains, it was the prosperous era of sandboats (sailing boats). The sandboat groups all joined the oil bean cake industry. There is a deep historical relationship. Therefore, grain industry arrivals have been prosperous from the past to the present. As for the arrivals and sales of the local goods industry, there are differences from the two industries mentioned above. The local goods industry focuses on peanuts, and the production area is only in Chongming and various places in Pudong. There is no northern source. The sales routes are only dismantled goods and retail households. (End)</p>

<h3>An Ideal Teacher</h3>
<p>— Guanghan</p>
<p>A teacher bears the heavy responsibility of education, constantly interacting with students, directly and indirectly influencing them deeply. Therefore, the quality of a teacher is of great importance to national education. But what are the standards for a good teacher? How should we choose? Although this is not easy to answer, I would like to write down the qualifications that an ideal teacher should possess and discuss them with everyone.</p>
<p>1.  Rich Knowledge The greatest purpose of reading is to seek knowledge. Therefore, a good teacher should be a learned and versatile person who can impart rich knowledge to students to satisfy their desire for knowledge. Of course, teachers are not omnipotent and do not know everything. But at least they should have sufficient research in the subject they teach in order to be qualified. If they are proficient in everything, that would be even better.</p>
<p>2.  Good Teaching Methods A teacher cannot fulfill the task of education solely with rich knowledge. In addition to knowledge, good teaching methods are also important. Because with good teaching methods, students can understand and comprehend everything that is explained, and teachers can share what they have gained with students. But this does not only refer to the kind of injection-style teaching method. It is useless for a teacher to simply pour knowledge into the students' minds. They must always pay attention to whether the students can absorb and digest it. Most importantly, they must also give students ample opportunity to develop their innate abilities freely. On the one hand, teachers should answer all the students' questions and make them understand. On the other hand, they should encourage students to think for themselves in order to develop their inherent nature. In addition, they must use appropriate methods everywhere to arouse students' interest in learning, and constantly allow students to express their opinions freely. Only in this way can teaching achieve twice the result with half the effort.</p>
<p>3.  Eloquent Eloquence We often see some teachers who have accumulated a lot of knowledge, but because their eloquence is dull and their words are not exhaustive, they often cannot express themselves fluently, causing students to fail to understand and gain nothing. Conversely, some who are good at eloquence, although their talents and learning are ordinary, when they are in the classroom, they speak eloquently and tirelessly, lecturing with great enthusiasm, eventually moving the listeners and enabling them to understand. Therefore, a fluent tongue is also indispensable for an excellent teacher.</p>
<p>4.  Novel Ideas Ideas are also very important. The times are advancing, and old ideas are certainly not suitable for today. Even new ideas are constantly changing. Therefore, an ideal teacher must also have ideas that are in line with the times. Because teachers should not only increase students' knowledge but also train their thinking. If the teacher's mind is full of some rotten old ideas, then the students who are trained will certainly not be able to adapt to the trend of the times and will eventually become laggards of the times. Therefore, we believe that a good teacher should be an educator with fresh ideas.</p>
<p>5.  Perfect Personality In education, I feel that the influence of personality is more powerful than the infusion of knowledge. Because humans are emotional animals, and emotion is the best way to guide them. A teacher with a perfect personality becomes a role model for students through his every move. Every word he says can move students. Through such subtle influence, students' character will naturally be cultivated and become more perfect.</p>
<p>An ideal teacher should at least possess the above five qualities to be worthy of being called an excellent educator and to be worthy of bearing the responsibility of education. Indeed, perhaps these conditions are too strict. I have also thought about this. But the task of education is very important, so how can we allow ourselves to be perfunctory?</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of a Past Summer</h3>
<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>Miss Spring came and went hastily, without bestowing on us a mysterious smile; while Mr. Summer's tyrannical power has already descended upon us.</p>
<p>The asphalt on the road is compressed into patterned patterns by the wheels. The rickshaw pullers' heels are like hitting moist mud, and a wave of heat turns into sweat droplets from their foreheads. People in the rickshaw feel a good breeze blowing in their faces, unbutton their collars or suit ties, and enjoy the happiness of this day. They cross their legs and shout, "Faster! Faster!"</p>
<p>The heads of rickshaw pullers are always wrapped in towels. Do they know? The sun is closer to you. This is the time to resist!</p>
<p>Cars shoot past like arrows. The fashionable old men and ladies in the cars are going to the invitation of the movie theater. Sensual movies, air conditioning pipes, and frozen ripples are waiting for their patronage. The drivers are much happier than the rickshaw pullers. Although they do not have the enjoyment of the latter, they also unbutton their collars when the wind blows in their faces.</p>
<p>Western-style houses connect to the sky. Exhausted, Miss slips her ankles and draped in a silk bathrobe, steps into the bedroom from the bathroom. The electric fan blows the hem of the bathrobe. She lights a cigarette, lies on the leather sofa, flips through a few pages of romance novels or the local supplement's movie advertisements, and falls into a hazy sleep.</p>
<p>At night, neon lights replace the daylight. People, cars, cars, people, Xujiahui, Caohejing…</p>
<p>The game room is crowded with audiences, carbonic acid gas steams, and gongs and drums are noisy. The bodies of prostitutes are wrapped in tight cheongsams, flirting and scolding. The young hooligans in open-necked silk shirts smile contentedly, exchanging banknotes for flesh.</p>
<p>Moonlight shines from the shade of the trees onto the ground, like a broken mirror. A pair of lovers walking side by side, the woman's disheveled hair resting on the man's shoulder. They step on the scattered moon shadows, walking slowly and whispering. The situation in the park is filled with a romantic atmosphere. There is no summer here, only night.</p>
<p>A typical Shanghai young master rushes into dance halls, massage parlors... enjoying the perverted stimulation of sex from a perverted life.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang, a foreign firm clerk in a small room, lights a British candle and frantically attacks the bedbugs attacking him. The lady from the sock factory upstairs also opens her eyes wide, listening to the Ningbo landlord's laughter of drawing three hundred points.</p>
<p>Streets, alleys. Top-notch cries for ten coins. Children, coolies, promoters of epidemics. Flies fly in groups on the discarded garbage heaps. A naked man lies on the plank door, humming the song of reaching out to touch his sister, and two neatly dressed silk sisters walk past, giggling.</p>
<p>In their dreams, the children in the countryside hear the sound of car horns. He asks his mother, "Dad bought a car?"</p>
<p>The lives of the poor roll under the wheels of cars, and the lives of the rich fall into the pond.</p>
<h3>A Scene of Rural Life in Late Autumn</h3>
<p>— Qian Xu</p>
<p>Don’t we often eat yellow sparrows? That thing is so plump and delicious, it’s best to have with wine. If we say that crabs are a unique taste in the water, then there is nothing better than yellow sparrows on land; so yellow sparrows and crabs can be called the “two wonders” in late autumn food.</p>
<p>Autumn is deep, and the grains in the fields are growing very full, with grains of white rice wrapped in thin shells, tender and solid. So the yellow sparrows become active, flying in groups to the rice fields to peck at them, and often a good acre of rice, with the grains growing full, is suddenly pecked to pieces by them. The farmers hate them, but there is nothing they can do, but to go and check it from time to time.</p>
<p>However, many farmers rely on catching yellow sparrows for an income at this time. Their methods of catching them are extremely skillful. They know that the nests of yellow sparrows are mostly on the滩边 of the reed pond, so every time the vast twilight casts shadows on the water, they go to the bank to check where the sparrows gather to roost. After checking, they go back to prepare. The tools for catching are very simple, a long-handled silk net bucket and a small glass lamp are enough.</p>
<p>After a while, it gets dark, and they all dress up. The so-called “dressing up” is not like the “modern girls” in Shanghai applying powder and makeup when they go out, nor is it like the gentlemen tidying up their clothes: they just take off their shoes and tie a belt around their waists for work convenience, and unbutton the buttons in front of their chests.</p>
<p>They are as if facing a big enemy, as if stealing a camp and robbing a village, walking quickly with gags in their mouths, not talking to each other. When they get to the reed beach, they walk towards the place they have seen in the sun. At this time, they are so quiet that they dare not even breathe out, and their steps are gently put down and then gently lifted up, step by step to reach the destination, and they continue to walk down into the water. The water in the reed pond is almost a foot deep, and it soaks to the knees when they step down, but they don't care about these things, and they concentrate on netting the roosting places of the sparrows with one bucket after another, but whether they net three or five, they must strangle them to death and throw them into their chests with the buttons undone. If they are not strangled to death, once there is a call, then the other yellow sparrows will fly away, and not only will they gain nothing, but they will also implicate all their companions to return empty-handed.</p>
<p>So on windy nights, it is even a good opportunity for them to show off their skills.</p>
<p>Now they are much smarter than before. On nights without strong winds, they will ask their wives and children to knock on gongs or kerosene tanks outside the reeds to disturb their hearing. They work while knocking, so they can achieve a lot of results.</p>
<p>However, have the people who eat them ever thought of the farmers who wade through the water and stay up all night when they are holding sparrows and drinking wine and talking loudly?</p>
<h3>Mr. Editor</h3>
<p>— Meng Ren</p>
<p>Stepping into the door of the editor’s office, my chest swelled. The desk was piled high with a lot of things, some red, some white, some light yellow, some…</p>
<p>Under the lake-green light, it was gloomy. If it weren’t for this, the old glasses on the bridge of my nose would have been a thousand degrees deeper.</p>
<p>I randomly grabbed a letter, cut it open with scissors, pulled out the work and took a look, it was simply a joke. My brow furrowed and I threw it away! Then I looked at the second letter, the beginning was…</p>
<p>×× My Love:</p>
<p>My heart is broken! Now…………………</p>
<p>I still threw it away. Then I looked at the third letter, lake-colored stationery, rough pen writing, and the green light, good, it was actually imitating drawing, so I threw it away again. The fourth letter was a poem, written very carefully, but it didn’t suit the nature of the journal, so I threw it away again. The fifth letter was like this, the sixth letter was attached with a letter, the letter roughly said, “How he suffered from the pain of being driven by life, and asking Mr. Editor for help.” It wasn’t until the seventh letter that I reluctantly kept it. The eighth letter was even funnier. The manuscript paper was signed ×× Miss, but in the meaning it fully expressed that he was a male, undoubtedly, it was eliminated again. The ninth and tenth were attached with letters. The former manuscript was introduced by a friend, and it was written:</p>
<p>Mr. ××:</p>
<p>×× is a pseudonym of ××, …… if there is anything incomplete, please</p>
<p>Mr. take care of it……………</p>
<p>The next one was a scolding letter 丨丨丨</p>
<p>Mr. ××:</p>
<p>The two clumsy works “×××” and “××××” that were previously discarded have now been published in ×× journal. With the reputation of ×× journal, it is ultimately better than</p>
<p>Your journal…………………</p>
<p>I smiled. It was a common thing for editors to encounter. I put the manuscript and the letter into the wastepaper basket. Looking further down, the eleventh letter, the twelfth letter, some with crab-walking writing style, some with English words filling the entire page, were all thrown into the wastepaper basket.</p>
<p>Looking further down, one letter, two letters, three letters,……… one letter, two letters, three letters……… My eyes are a little blurry. I’ll rest for a while, take a cigarette, and then look further down, one letter, two letters, three letters……… It’s about time, the manuscripts are finished. Calculating, about fifteen out of a hundred and ten letters were selected. Because of the limited space, I had to sacrifice seven of the fifteen letters. How sad! Those that were selected were discarded again, but how could the editor not know that they were made by the author’s painstaking efforts, but because of the limited space! It was just a helpless cry!</p>
<p>Because of “limited space,” the editor became the invisible enemy of “disappointed authors.”</p>

<h3>Fate</h3>
<p>— Jian</p>
<p>Fate has ruled us Chinese for who knows how many thousands of years. Countless people have died miserably in its iron grip in the past, and are now groaning under its iron hooves. People are fooled by it, anesthetized by it, and naturally listen to it willingly, letting it trample on them, letting it beheaded. Although there have been a few people who have risen up to oppose it, denouncing it as superstition, it has not had much effect.</p>
<p>After the Xinhai Revolution, the May Fourth Movement, the National Revolution, and several political and cultural shocks, fate also shook and became unlucky; but it was only a “flash in the pan,” and soon it “resurrected from the ashes” and came back even more fiercely.</p>
<p>Now that the revolution is over, fate is sprouting up like bamboo shoots after the rain. It is naturally to be expected that the business of fortune-tellers is booming everywhere. Since the sentence “The Chinese are destined to suffer” was published, fate has seized the opportunity to move restlessly, and its momentum has become stronger and stronger. Recently, the concept of fate has been widely discussed in people’s conversations, articles, and correspondence. Fate has shrouded all of China, and fate has occupied the hearts of all Chinese people. Great is fate!</p>
<p>They are all the same people; some are rich and successful, some are down and out for life; some hold important positions, some are displaced. As for the victims in disaster areas where the flames of war are raging and floods and droughts are everywhere, they eat wind and dew and look haggard; the bourgeoisie in the big cities are drinking and singing wildly in a world of wine, green, and red, living a life of extreme pleasure. This contradictory phenomenon is generally attributed to fate by superficial views, and only fate can easily solve this problem vaguely.</p>
<p>However, this is not the truth, it is just a mistake. Fate has absolutely no relationship with people’s actions, and of course it cannot produce cause and effect; at most, people first believe in the fallacy of fate, change direction, change attitude, and become putting the cart before the horse. If everything is determined by fate, then people become zombies, unable to move, and have to listen to nature. What is the point of “effort” and “struggle,” what is the point of “resisting Japan” and “anti-imperialism”? It’s all nonsense, what does it look like?</p>
<p>Fate originally arose in an unequal social system. People encounter all kinds of difficulties, but they have neither the courage to overcome them nor the willingness to do so out of selfishness. They say it is fate, and there is nothing they can do; so they bow their heads and calm down, and forget about everything. This is a manifestation of human laziness, a good way to escape reality.</p>
<p>It is not fate that determines life, but people who create fate. Here we can find a conclusion: fate and the doctrine of determinism, like “theocracy,” are unique to a deformed, morbid society, and are things that reduce resistance and eliminate aggressiveness.</p>

<p>Drama</p>
<h3>Eliminating Evil and Pacifying the Good</h3>
<p>— Wan Cheng</p>
<p>Scene One</p>
<p>A panoramic view of the village, bathed in the nascent sunlight, is exceptionally fresh and serene. The door of a house in the village opens, and a farmer emerges from within. He appears to be in his forties. In his right hand, he holds a kitchen knife, and in his left, a hen, ready to slaughter it outside. A peasant woman, roughly the same age as the farmer, stands inside the courtyard near the doorway, peacefully watching the farmer, holding an infant.</p>
<p>Farmer (Looking up at the sky as he exits the door, a smile on his face, he says to the peasant woman inside): Siliu's Mother, look how clear the sky is today. This child is truly lucky!</p>
<p>Peasant Woman: Yes, the heavens know it's Siliu's one-month celebration today, so they've gifted us with a clear day for us to celebrate joyfully. (Speaking, she lowers her head toward the infant in her arms): [Babbling sounds to the baby] Even the Bodhisattva is helping... (Making cooing sounds to the child, the peasant woman cannot resist kissing his face wildly.)</p>
<p>Farmer (Smiling as he slaughters the chicken, muttering to himself): This chicken is so plump and delightful! If I hadn't bought it early, someone else would have snatched it up. It's not just anything; if the chicken isn't fat, the soup won't be flavorful. This is a once-in-a-lifetime event, and I can't let the guests be anything less than delighted! (Having finished slaughtering the chicken, the couple goes inside together. After a while, the farmer emerges again, carrying a bamboo basket, calling into the house as he leaves): Siliu's Mother, hurry up and start simmering the chicken over the fire. The soup won't be rich if the fire isn't strong enough. And you need to tidy up the house, so when the guests arrive in a little while, things aren't messy and unclean. I'm going to the market in town to buy some vegetables now, and I'll be right back. (A chorus of "Okay, okay" comes from inside the house. The farmer strides off energetically. After a short pause, the peasant woman comes out with a rice winnowing basket, casually closing the door behind her. She has gone to the stream to wash rice.)</p>
<p>A young village head rushes over from afar, accompanied by a servant. Reaching the farmer's door, the servant says:</p>
<p>Servant: Young Master, I just saw them slaughtering a chicken. Do you think they deserve to eat chicken? (Staring at the doorway, he sees chicken blood on the ground): Look, isn't that blood on the ground? There's no doubt they stole the chicken from our manor!</p>
<p>Village Head (Believing him without question, he becomes furious): Damn them, damn them! They're really audacious, daring to steal my chicken! Do they think they can swat flies on a tiger's head? Well, since they've brought this upon themselves, they can't blame me for being harsh! (With that, he angrily bursts through the bamboo fence, ordering the servant to return first.)</p>
<p>Scene Two</p>
<p>Three thatched huts, arranged quite neatly: the central one is the main room, the left one is the kitchen, and the right one is the bedroom. The village head searches everywhere, only finding the chicken simmering in the kitchen. He can't help but become ten times angrier. However, no one is home, and he can't wait for the farmer to return to argue with him. He goes straight to the bedroom on the right, picks up the infant lying in the cradle, and throws it forcefully to the ground. There is a tragic cry, and he rushes out the door and leaves. Just as he exits, the servant rushes back, hurriedly saying to him:</p>
<p>Servant: Young Master, the chicken from the manor has been found. Someone had covered it with a bamboo basket. Young Master, since they didn't steal it, please forgive them!</p>
<p>Village Head (Seeming regretful, he remains silent.)</p>
<p>Scene Three</p>
<p>A major village road, with a constant stream of people coming and going. Some are going to town, others are returning from town. Suddenly, a crazed man and woman rush in, none other than the farmer and his wife. They are crying and lamenting, their appearance extremely pitiful.</p>
<p>Couple: My heart! My little darling! My ill-fated child!</p>
<p>The pedestrians, seeing this, are terrified and scatter in all directions, fearing being grabbed by the mad people.</p>
<p>After a while, the village head brings several strong laborers, ordering them to bind the two mad people and immediately drive them out of the village.</p>
<p>Village Head (Addressing the villagers): As the village head of this village, I bear the responsibility of "eliminating evil and pacifying the good." Therefore, I am now driving them away to prevent everyone from living in peace.</p>
<p>Villagers (Clapping and cheering loudly): Ah, we must all support the village head who seeks happiness for us! We should all present the village head with a plaque that says "Eliminating Evil and Pacifying the Good"!</p>
<p>Crowd: Yes, everyone agrees! And we wish our village head a long life!</p>
<p>Amidst this clamorous cheering, the village head returns home with a smile. | The End |</p>

<p>Movie Supplement</p>
<h3>Hollywood's Method of Protecting Young Actors - The Strictness of California Law - Enough for Lawyers to Study for a Year</h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>After writing an article yesterday about "Hollywood's Most Adorable Child," I felt it was quite interesting and wanted to add more. This article, "Hollywood's Method of Protecting Young Actors," continues from the previous one. The central employment agency for film professionals in Hollywood always has thousands of children's names on file, waiting to be selected by various companies. It includes people of all nationalities: Chinese, Japanese, Indian, African black people, Mexican people, Siamese, or Bornean people, all of them. They each have their own uses, and when needed, the value of black children is no lower than that of white children, or even more expensive due to their rarity.</p>
<p>Since these child actors occupy a very important position on set, the local authorities cannot help but think of ways to protect their health and safety. California law is extremely strict in protecting these child actors. We can now briefly describe some of it, hoping that our film companies can adopt all possible methods of protecting young actors without waiting for legal judgments, creating happiness for these adorable young actors.</p>
<p>According to California law, children under six months of age are only allowed to stay in the company for two hours each day, and work on set must not exceed twenty minutes per day, and each take must not exceed thirty seconds. Children over six months of age and under two years of age are only allowed to stay in the company for four hours each day, of which work must not exceed two hours. Child actors from two to six years old can stay in the company for six hours each day, but work must not exceed three hours. Child actors from six to eighteen years old can stay in the company for eight hours each day, and work must not exceed four hours. The salary that child actors should receive is also stipulated by the local authorities. For child actors less than one month old, the daily salary is US$75; for those over one month and under three months, it is US$50 per day; and for those from three to six months, it is US$25 per day.</p>
<p>The above are just some brief outlines. In reality, the laws protecting child actors in Hollywood are extraordinarily complex. Many prohibitions are enough for lawyers to study as a specialized subject. For example, in order to protect the eyesight of child actors, it is forbidden to use strong lights on their faces. There must be nurses on set. In addition, there are women's associations, childcare associations, and their representatives come to supervise every day. There are specific time regulations for the breastfeeding or food of child actors. When a company hires a child actor, they must first have their physical examined by an educational institution. If they continue to work afterwards, they must be re-examined every three months. How to arrange the nursery in the company, etc., are also detailed in the law. Child actors' working hours cannot be after 10 p.m. The rest cannot be described in detail due to space limitations.</p>

<h3>Review of "The Tears of a Daughter-in-Law" - Another Language - Produced by MGM - Premieres at Cathay</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Since the premiere of "White Sister," Helen Hayes has given us the most profound impression. Regardless of whether she is the leading tragic star of the time, she has certainly been very successful in tragedies such as "The White Sister" and "A Farewell to Arms." In "White Sister," when we see her wearing a white headscarf in the monastery, saying goodbye to her lover through the iron gate, and facing the altar to cut her hair, that kind of solemn sentiment shatters the feelings of every audience member. In "A Farewell to Arms," when she receives her lover's affection in front of the hero's statue, only she can show that kind of passionate yet timid inner performance with such real emotion. Such acting skills are worthy of our sincere attention in any case. Similarly, in this film, she writes about her own love for her husband, although her husband's love is not as sweet as she ideally imagined, and although her husband's family often teases her in an unbearable way, she endures it and still waits for the revival of love with her entire pure heart. However, she is always a timid person. She finally accepts the affection of her nephew, although she rationally feels that this action is inappropriate. Especially after that climax of breaking the plaster statue, when the husband leaves in anger, and she kisses the nephew but pushes him away, that kind of profound expression of contradictory emotions truly shows her unique talent.</p>
<p>At the same time, the husband, Robert Montgomery, is consistent, just like in "The Single Standard" and "Between Two Women", as relaxed, flirty, and suave as ever. Isn't it so? When an actor has their own unique personality, they can always achieve great success in a suitable script. Here, although we cannot see that he has made any more drastic progress than before, the fact that he has appropriately fulfilled his due responsibilities is very clear. We see, when he is reading the newspaper, impatiently asking, "Who opened that window?" watching his nephew take his wife out, watching his wife and nephew dance infatuatedly, and waiting at his mother's house for his naughty wife who had been out all night to come to him, are all scenes that others cannot do without laughter and tears.</p>
<p>In addition to the protagonists, all the other supporting roles are also very diligent. Even the young John Beal tried his best to bring out that simple and rich emotion, such as before and after breaking the plaster statue, and when his parents questioned him about last night's whereabouts at his grandmother's house.</p>
<p>With excellent actors, the work will always gain most of its success in any case. Conversely, under the current state of Chinese films, the richness of their content is not superior to that of American films, but it is often because of the lack of good actors that everything cannot be perfectly expressed on the screen with all the skills.</p>
<p>We cannot deny that American films already have mature acting skills, especially since many actors have sufficient academic qualifications, which adds a lot of color to their films. Therefore, I would like to advise Chinese film actors to not use all their energy to pursue empty fame, but to work hard to improve their skills in cultivation, and at the same time fulfill their great responsibilities to Chinese films, assuming that they also recognize the future of Chinese films.</p>
<p>I have said a few digressive words, but these are by no means nonsense. Now let's talk about the other aspects of "The Tears of a Daughter-in-Law."</p>
<p>First of all, we have to pay attention to the structure of this script, which is a very literary and meticulously described work. It is often said that pure literary films are not welcomed by the general audience (the fact that "Spring Silkworms" didn't sell as well as "Man Jiang Hong" is a good example), but this kind of script has its own very high value, which is undeniable. As for this film, we must admit the playwright's high level of descriptive skill in any case.</p>
<p>He takes the family affairs of a small bourgeois family as his subject matter, meticulously writing about the common love twists and turns of young couples. I think everyone who has been married has had this strange experience. No matter how much one trusts one's love for the other party, there will always be a few moments of mischief. After a calm explanation, they will reconcile as before.</p>
<p>Here, we are reminded of "Waterloo Bridge," which explained the worries of a husband who was wilful due to economic difficulties, leading to a break with his wife, until they reunited ten years later. "Waterloo Bridge" can point out this economic relationship, so it is naturally more emphatic than this "Tears of a Daughter-in-Law." However, the latter also realistically depicts this kind of small matter, writing a very frank part of the life of the small bourgeoisie, and it also has its value. As for the meticulous depiction, we only need to see it expressed in the nephew personally smashing his uncle's statue, or the petty eating of cakes by the sisters-in-law.</p>
<p>The director's high level, limited by space, cannot be discussed in detail. It is clear that the director has had great success here.</p>
<h3>Review of "Three Escorts" | Premieres at Central | ▲ A Little Commentary</h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>Because of the audience's demand, the themes of Chinese films roughly have to touch on some social realities. This point is reflected even in the productions of the relatively backward so-called "small companies." The recently premiered "Blood Road" and "Dawn" are clear examples. But the development of history is always a curve. After "Mad Current" and before "Spring Silkworms," there was even a so-called "Man Jiang Hong" for us to watch. Then, the martial arts film "Three Escorts," which was produced two years ago, is being screened today, and we don't need to be surprised!</p>
<p>"Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" was banned, saying it was too absurd, but American Western films are flooding the market. Of course, "Burning of the Red Lotus Temple" and "Western films" are a little different, but this difference is only in degree, not in essence. Therefore, there is a reason why many people find it difficult to recognize that Chinese films have already surpassed American films in terms of content. Then, although "Three Escorts" is similar to Western films, in the development of Chinese films, the screening of "Three Escorts" has to be considered more serious.</p>
<p>But from this film "Three Escorts," we see that the progress of Chinese films is not only in terms of content, but also in technical aspects (including directing, etc.) There has also been considerable progress, which increases our optimism about the future of Chinese films. This is just small talk.</p>
<p>▲ The Film Itself</p>
<p>The story of "Three Escorts" is formulaic: chivalrous heroes, eliminating evil and pacifying the good. Originally, there was also a happy ending, and even the brochure wrote, "Huifen and Huifang are paired with Da Song," "Meigu is paired with Wang Bin," "Three pairs of lovebirds and Zhang Fa the old man enjoy their remaining years in the mortal world." (Original text) As such, on the screen, we only see Wang Bin recover, followed by a swaying wind skill, which was probably cut out, and cutting it out is at least a bit clever.</p>
<p>I would like to specifically write down some of the shortcomings of "Three Escorts":</p>
<p>First, in terms of the story, the county magistrate is riding on an official ship, but the crew happens to be a bandit gang. Since they are a bandit gang, why don't they rob the wealth first? Or respond during the great battle between Jade Butterfly and the "Three Escorts," and rob the wealth after Jade Butterfly is dead? The other coincidences are even more numerous.</p>
<p>Second, in terms of directing, the introduction of the characters at the opening is too dull, one shot, one subtitle. It's the same in the middle, too many subtitles, interrupting the audience's attention.</p>
<p>Third, using daylight photography, the lighting is too poor, the outdoor scenery and clothes move too much!</p>
<p>Fourth, the actors Wang Yuanlong, Da Zichun, and Song Yuquan are all very bad. Although Zhang Meiyu is not good, she has a few good expressions.</p>
<h3>Novel Movie Extravaganza No More Dinner at Eight (9)</h3>
<p>— Ma Teng</p>
<p>Max has left, and Renaud stands unsteadily, trembling, his hand touching his forehead. His hat has fallen off, and he doesn't even notice. He looks around, but feels that everything around him is mocking him, teasing him, threatening him. He stumbles to the dressing mirror, and sees himself. He covers his face with his hands, and dares not look again. He picks up the telegram, reads half of it, and throws it away. There is a wine bottle lying on the floor. He picks it up and pours it into his mouth, but there is not a drop left. He throws the wine bottle away again.</p>
<p>After a while, the hotel manager comes again. He very politely discusses with Renaud, asking him to move out of that large room, because an old customer is used to living in that room, just like at home, and they must get it. Renaud asks him, if he moves out of that room, what other room will he be given to live in? The manager says, "Now is the peak season for the Expo, people are coming from all over, and there really isn't a single empty room in the hotel." Hearing this, Renault laughed strangely and said, "It doesn't matter, it doesn't matter, I'm just about to notify the accounting office that I'm moving out soon. I have some friends in Palm Beach inviting me to go. The parade car has already been booked... when do you want this room?" The manager said, "No rush, no rush, is tomorrow at noon okay?" Renaud nods subconsciously. The manager said, "Thank you, Mr. Renaud. I'm really sorry for all the inconvenience." He bowed and went out.</p>
<p>Renaud stares blankly as the hotel manager leaves. After a while, he gradually wakes up. He hears the sound of a hurdy-gurdy in the street outside. He goes to the window and looks at the many people gathered in the street. He picks up the telegram, takes out that one dollar and seven cents from his pocket, looks at it for a while, wraps the money in the telegram paper, and throws it out the window to the street musician. He slams the window shut, takes a few steps back, and collapses into a chair. He tries his best to cheer up, but he no longer has the strength to cheer up. He looks dizzyingly at Pola's graceful shadow on the mantelpiece. He mumbles to it as if in a dream, "Let's imagine that this is our home. And let's imagine that this is a real stove, not a fake wooden one that burns gas."</p>
<p>"Gas! Gas!" He suddenly has an idea. He bends over and tests it, and a terrifying thought attacks his brain. He opens the small door of the gas pipe, listens to the hissing sound of the gas coming out, and feels that he has won. He closes the gas pipe again, and inspects the room all around. He sees black shadows in every corner of the room, preparing to immediately crawl onto his body. He jumps forward, runs to the door, turns the key, and locks the door. He takes off his tuxedo and tears it down, stuffing the cracks under the door. He also goes to the bathroom and takes many clothes, and stuffs all the empty cracks. He inspects all around again, and feels very satisfied. He straightens his tie, and puts on a robe. He doesn't want to neglect the final appearance at all. He also turns off all the lights, leaving only one on. He opens the door of the gas pipe again. He lies back in the chair, looking at Pola's photograph. Next to him is a telephone, and his hand gropes for it, wanting to make a call to Pola. (To be continued)</p>
