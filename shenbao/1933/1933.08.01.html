<p>現世界六十餘國。中除若干小國自身不能有所主張。外其言動足以影響於世界者。要不過十餘國而已。此次世界經濟會議開會之初。與會之六十六國代表。莫不懷極熱烈之希望。挾國際恊作之信念以臨倫敦。對於通貨安定。關稅休戰。生產者恊定等問題。希冀能互相諒解。在互惠與互讓之原則下。得一較爲具體的决定。以渡過目前難關而開闢經濟復興之新途徑。無如此十餘大國。各懷自利之心。未能坦懷掬誠以相商榷。以故開會之初。即發生若干不可挽救之破綻。會議之進行。遂亦遍處荆棘而無從舉步矣。在七月下旬會議將停之際。有人以爲此次會議。準備未週。開幕過早。列國未能在事先求得充分之諒解。是以會議塲中一旦於實際利益上發現矛盾情勢。即不易着手調和耳。然其實自去年六月洛桑會議以來。即已將此次會議中之重要議題。預爲接洽。一年之時間。不可謂不長。且美總統羅斯福於本年三月就任之初。又曾約當世主要國家十一國。在華盛頓會談。其預圖諒解之運動。尤不可謂不詳且盡。故該會議失敗之眞因。不在乎時間之遲早。而於各國各自積極找尋擺脫經濟恐慌之出路。膜視國際間共同之關係也。</p>
<p>近年以來。世界交通日趨發達。海洋相距之里程。陸地山河之間隔。日見接近。國與國間之關係。亦日益密切而不可分離。是國際間必須相對合作。乃能有益於世界。然而歷史遺傳過深。國家民族自利之習慣。尤非短時間内所能消除。在此世界經濟恐慌深化。一般社會生活艱難之際。資本主義主要國家。皆致力於自國之建設。求經濟上之自給自足。對於海外關係。則惟求開拓市塲。活用投資而已。然舉凡當世各國。旣莫能脫離國際間相互利害之聯繫而政治上狹義的國民主義。旣已抬頭。其反映於經濟關係也。亦至嚴重。是以美國在召集華盛頓談話尙未開始之前。即放棄金本制度。以求英法之諒解與合作。國際間之暗礁由是隱伏。而戰債問題又横亘其間。於是歐洲各國乃有聯合一致以對美國之勢。</p>
<p>在會議期中因發生意見而致於停會。本無足奇。惟在此會議進行途中。有兩種新傾向。足令吾儕十分注意者。第一爲日英關係之惡化。其來源始於渥大華會議。至印度菲洲等增加棉製品進口稅以後而益甚。是即所謂英帝國内之經濟聯盟也。日本於此。以爲英國此種經濟上之敵意。足陷日本於苦境。於是大亞細亞主義。乘機復活。［日滿］經濟聯盟。乃將進而包括我國全土。設欲伸其勢力於長江。日英間之新衝突。必愈見尖銳。第二爲英美對。立由南美諸國以迄於坎拿大。自產業經營以至金融投資。在在顯示其不可調解之局面。加以戰債問題之糾纏。遂更加緊其惡劣情勢。惟西部太平洋上。日本横行無忌。獨制霸權。美如欲開拓新市塲。固將受極嚴重之制限。或竟無發展之可能。英國舊有之經濟實力。亦因日本採取積極攻勢之故。匪特不能向前發展。且恐不免於逐漸退縮。是以英美有取得一時諒解之可能。在東方共同對日。或且打開另一方式之新局。面亦未可知也。</p>
<p>歐洲情勢。在最近四十餘日中。已可謂爲另成一格。就整個舊大陸諸國而論。固多對美之傾向。然其中有蘇聯爲資本主義外另樹一幟。法德仇恨。又不可解。德意以實際利益而暫時接近。法國又將糾合波蘭捷克猶哥等中歐諸國以爲抵制。所難者歐洲天產。已開發殆盡。今後銷國主義盛行。勢益將難於</p>
<p>自立。於是世界糾紛之焦點。在政治上將由巴爾幹而移至遠東。列强自身之矛盾與夫對蘇聯之暗鬭。均將以遠東問題爲中心。而實行其捭　縱横之策略。在經濟上惟有中國市塲。尙多開發之餘地。則此後之競爭。亦將以我國爲戰塲。而實行其流血與不流血之角逐。我國民處此。其仍效日俄戰爭時淸庭之坐視耶。抑效土爾其之奮起爲遠東之新國耶。惟國人自圖之耳。</p>

<p>努力培養人民自治能力以期漸從官治進爲民治吳市長昨在市府紀念週報告中央社云、昨晨市府舉行紀念週、各局所職員百餘人、由市長吳鐵城主席、行禮如儀、吳市長開始報告今後市政設施之新方針、以下爲吳市長報告辭、各位同志總理遺敎、最關重要的、就是建設、我們革命的目的、也在建設、而</p>
<h3 id="c125">建設工作 <a href="#c125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>除民生建設與經濟建設外、尤以政治建設、最爲緊要、當此訓政時期、全黨同志、不論在行政機關或黨部工作、或服務於地方上之各種職業、都應領導全國人民、共同完成訓政時期的政治建設、政治建設的基礎、在地方自治、故地方自治工作不能完成、民治基礎亦即不能鞏固、民治基礎不能鞏固、政治建設之目的、也不能達到、所以市政府自去年一二八戰事、經過大破壞以後、財政雖屬萬分支絀、猶欲竭力依原定自治程序、努力籌備</p>
<h3 id="c126">地方自治 <a href="#c126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>工作、并又組織臨時市參議會、臨時市參議會參議員、雖係推舉、而非選舉、然其職權、則與正式民選市參議會相同、故市政府全體對於臨時市參議會之尊重、也應與尊重民選之市參議會一樣、此爲訓政時期籌備自治程序中之必經階段、我們努力籌備自治工作、須以實現民治爲目的、不應像過去各處籌備自治者區長鄕紳地保、奉到中央通令後、只掛起籌備自治之招牌、而毫無成績表現、我國連年、均處於不安定的狀態之中、籌備自治工作、也因各種變故、時作時止、故地方自治、雖經數次之籌備、但至今仍未成功、而地方自治的基礎、也沒有建立、所以本市府同人、以過去經騐、一方面固應很熱心的來籌備地方自治、一方面尤應反省過去籌備地方自治的缺點和錯誤、以十分的精神、來</p>
<h3 id="c127">努力進行 <a href="#c127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>籌備程序、要定得很嚴、很實在、務使我們實施籌備地方自治的努力、得有成績表現出來、這是我們對於實行地方自治應注意之點、復次、實施地方自治最好的地方、在都市、因爲都市是人才比較集中、交通的設備、也比較完備、同時也是一個經濟的中心、所以在都市裏、實施地方自治、比較内地其他各處容易、因爲都市對於自治的條件、較爲具備、所以我們在都市裏服務的同志、要共同努力於地方自治工作之完成、使地方自治的訓政工作、得在都市成功、同時也可引起全國各處、對於政治建設的興趣、故市府凡遇有可使地方人民來</p>
<h3 id="c128">參加市政 <a href="#c128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>的機會、我們都是儘量給地方人民、好像市銀行、本是市府官辦的銀行、而市銀行裏許多理事監事、都由我們聘請地方領袖來擔任、使他們來參與該銀行一切行務、又像最近我們要辦的興業信託社、社裏的理事監事、我們也想聘請地方領袖大商人來擔任、還有幾件事、如市立圖書館、市立博物館、市立醫院等、我們也想請地方人士也來參加籌備、不但來參加籌備、將來成立後、也要請地方人士、組織理事會董事會、來管理各種事業、總之、我們今後市政設施之新方針、總是想多給地方人士以機會、來參與市政、使市政一天一天地由官治進而至於民治、故地方上之各種公共事業、不但在初辦或籌備時期、都要請地方人士參加、來</p>
<h3 id="c129">共同進行 <a href="#c129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>就是在成立以後、也要交給地方人士來管理、使這種有關全市市民的公益事業、不致受政治或人事變遷的影響、所以上海市政府、從今以後、當本此政策方針、努力做去、以達到由官治至民治的目的、完成政治建設之理想、</p>

<p>工廠檢查問題、上海市政府兪秘工部局總裁費信惇、迭次交涉、現雖得有眉目、但外傳將定何日簽字、尙日成立檢查處等、實屬無稽、檢查工廠、雖屬實業部主管、但此次上海租界工廠檢查問題、旣係地方事件、故由上海市政府負責交涉、實業部惟隨時加以指示、故合約簽字及檢查處之成立等事、悉以上海市政府交涉、至如何程度、而可决定、</p>

<p>實業部計劃興辦之鋼鐵廠、大約九月内可成立、漁業建設費之徵收、過去因商民誤會、曾發生糾紛、現經各方調解、已得相當解决、對俄貿易因俄貨素主傾銷、故在中國市塲上、漸露頭角、至於我國將來是否設立對俄貿易專局、或仍由商辦、此事須俟宋部長返國後、方可决定、蓋此事與關稅頗有關係也、</p>

<p>（哈瓦斯社三十日巴黎電）英法兩國舉行台維斯杯却令治賽之最後一日、第一組柯顯以五比七·六比四·四比六·六比四·六比四擊敗奥斯汀、但英國潘萊以四比六·八比六·六比二·七比五·擊敗法國墨林、結果英國以三對二擊敗法國而奪得銀光燦爛之台維斯杯、按法國（四騎士）拉各斯脫·柯顯·鮑羅脫拉·與勃魯寗、於一九二七年、渡美奮　而將台杯奪獲、自此以後、無届不勝、本年比賽第一日、柯顯若將潘萊擊敗、則仍可繼續保持勝利、英國選手、如奥斯汀·潘萊輩、球藝精　、允列上乘、自有其取勝之道、所可惜者、美國名將如雲、而帶際决賽、竟敗於英國、實非大衆所預料、茲將本日比賽詳情、記之於下、</p>

<p>各勝二盤第一組比賽、最初三盤、比數爲五比七·六比四·四比六、奥斯汀佔先、形勢於柯顯不利、第四盤開始、雙方皆謹愼從事、採取守勢、但若對方稍露弱點、則立卽乘隙進攻、奥斯汀先勝兩局、第三局柯顯發球得勝、第四局又爲奥斯汀所、勝、是時爲三比一之比、柯顯力自振作、得以三比三造成平局、奥斯汀乃以深長之正手球、迫令柯顯常處底線、因得以四比三佔先、柯顯繼又造成四比四、並以五比四佔先、卒以</p>
<p>六比四得勝、</p>
<p>最後决戰最後一盤、開始雙方各勝一局、奥斯汀以二比一、繼以三比一·四比二佔先、奥氏勝利、似已無可置疑、但柯顯一鼓作氣極力進攻、使奥斯汀奔馳塲中、不暇返攻、奥氏欲謀上網攔截、但柯顯以高球阻止之、柯顯因觀衆歡呼鼓勵、奮起精神、得以四比四挽回危局、繼以五比四佔先、卒以六比四得勝、</p>

<p>第一盤最後一組比賽、爲墨林對潘萊、雙方各勝兩局、墨林連下三局、而以五比二佔先、卒以六比四勝第一盤、</p>

<p>— 孺牛</p>
<p>關於張獻忠的傳說，中國各處都有，可見大家都很以他爲奇特的，我先前也便是很以他爲奇特的人們中的一個。</p>
<p>兒時見過一本書，呌作『無雙譜』，是淸初人之作，取歷史上極特别無二的人物，各畫一像，一面題些詩，但壞人好像是沒有的。因此我後來想到可以擇歷來極其特别，而其實是代表着中國人性質之一種的人物，作一部中國的『人史，』如英國嘉勒爾的『英雄及英雄崇拜』，美國亞懋生的『偉人論』那樣。惟須好壞俱有，有嚼雪苦節的蘇武，拾身求法的玄奬，有『鞠躬盡瘁，死而後已』的孔明，但也有呆信古法，『死而後已』的王莽，也有半當眞半取笑的變法的王安石；張獻忠當然也在内。但現在是毫沒有動筆的意思了。</p>
<p>『蜀碧』一類的書，記張獻忠殺人的事頗詳細，但也散漫，令人看去彷彿他是像『爲藝術而藝術』的一樣，專在『爲殺人而殺人』了。他其實是别有目的的。他開初並不很殺人，他何嘗不想做皇帝。後來知道李自成進了北京，接着是淸兵入關，自己只剩了沒落這一條路，於是就開手殺，殺····他分明的感到，天下已沒有自己的東西，現在是在毁壞　别人的東西了，這和有些末代的風雅皇帝，</p>
<p>在死前燒掉了祖宗或自己所搜集的書籍古董寳貝之類的心情，完全是一樣。他還有兵，而沒有古董之類，所以就殺殺，殺人，殺·····</p>
<p>但他還要維持兵，這實在不過是維持殺。他殺得沒有平民了，就派許多較爲心腹的人到兵們中去，設法竊聽，偶有怨言，即躍出執之，戮其全家（他的兵像是有家眷的，也許就是擄來的婦女）。以殺治兵，用兵來殺，自己是完了，但要這樣的達到一同滅亡的末路。我們對於别人的或公共的東西，不是也是不很愛惜的麽？</p>
<p>所以張獻忠的舉動，一看雖然似乎古怪，其實是極平常的。古怪的倒是那些被殺的人們，怎麽會總是束手伸延的等他殺，一定要淸朝的肅王來射死他，這纔作爲奴才而得救，而還說這是前定，就是所謂『吹蕭不用竹，一箭貫當胸』。</p>
<p>但我想，這豫言詩是後人造出來的，我們不知道那時的人們眞是怎麽想。</p>
<h3 id="c252">戰爭與和平 <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 願肥</p>
<p>日本佔領了東省，現在正在發狂似地擴充軍備，豫備作分割中國的最後决戰，那理由據說是『爲了東洋的和平』。同時，據最近的報道，爲了支持世界的作家巴比塞等九月間在上海召集的反戰大會，加藤勘十秋田兩雀等發起了一個『遠東和平之友會』。</p>
<p>到底，甲方所說的和平和乙方所說的和平是不是一樣的東西呢？</p>
<p>顯然地，帝國主義者底意思是，如果把我所要的東西都給我，就可以和平，否則，我只有不得已地採取『自衛手段』。明白了當地說，他們所說的和平就等於戰爭。其所以要提到『和平』者，張烟幕而已。大家都知道烟幕是一種兵器。但還有一種眞正愛和平反對戰爭的人，那就是在生活重壓下面的勞苦大衆。他們從現實生活裏殘酷的經騐上知道戰爭是爲的誰，在戰爭裏眞正受犧牲的是他們自己以及與他們同樣的伙計。他們反對戰爭，反對爲了自己的利益而鼓動戰爭的人們。當然，這樣的認識會把他們引到更積極的鬥爭之路。</p>
<p>然而，今天某報上，有一位先生在論日本農工革命』（？）的文章中，發表了精闢的見解：說日本勞苦工農祗有在世界戰爭中才能得到解放，說反對戰爭就</p>
<p>會『陷於反對世界戰爭即反對日本農工革命的滑稽的結論』。</p>
<p>何如？這結論滑稽不滑稽？</p>
<p>然而，這位先生還有更精闢的見银：說日本人反對戰爭『只是假裝時貎（？），並對中國朋友虚表同情，及自示不甘落伍』，勸中國人不要受他們底『騙』云。當然，我們並不否認有許多口頭上說說反對戰爭來騙人的人，猶之乎我們並不否認有許多造出種理由來『騙』人參加戰爭的人一樣。但日本勞苦大衆所發動的眞正反戰運動是和這不相干的。就</p>
<p>是據日本政府所發表的，去年一年中以反戰爲中心任務之一的日本革命運動者被檢舉的在七千以上。而我們知道，這裏面有幾十名是照字義直解地倒斃了。日本的大衆要用他們底自由，血，生命來騙中國人，那騙法眞是笨得出奇。遠不如我們的聰明人，祗要在白紙上寫上黑字就夠。</p>
<p>誰爲戰爭，誰爲和平，事實可替我們作證。</p>
<h3 id="c253">出氣主義 <a href="#c253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>在非常寥落的觀衆中，我們看了劉别謙所導演的活財神。</p>
<p>前幾時，上海小市民對於『如你中了五十萬大奬』這樣一個試題曾有過許多答案。但劉别謙所做『假如你有百萬金』的十個答案，却不爲上海小市民所喜，雖說航空奬劵開奬在即。劉别謙的答案中，有兩個非當深刻；一個正將執行死刑的囚犯，忽接着百萬金的支票；他一面走向法塲，一而狂喊『我是百萬金的大富翁。』又有三位丘八把百萬金支票當作笑話，輕輕用以抵付雜貨店的舊欠，眼見雜貨店老板平地化爲大富翁，自己則憑欄呆看。其餘那些答案，大都是寫壓在下意識層的欲求，在百萬金支票的機會之下，大大發洩一下。磁器店夥計，因了平日碰碎磁器的賠累，這一天，儘量把店中磁器打個痛快；時髦女郎稱心如意地佈置自己的客廳和臥室，把電燈關了又開，開了又關；嘔氣過多的小職員昻然闖入經理室，報經理以惡聲而去；懊喪於新汽車被撞的某夫婦，買了八輛汽車，横衝直撞，直到撞完爲止。這有如茀羅乙德所說，在夢中滿足了我們的欲望；平日被經濟制度壓迫着，一旦得了機會，爆發而爲快意的報復，所謂出氣主義是也。</p>
<p>不僅或然的經濟佳運，要使被壓迫的欲望發爲快意的報復；或然的權力佳運，也要演出同樣的快意的報復。平日餓　了肚子，在菜館外看别人吃牛排鴿蛋，把自己的口味嚥了又嚥；一旦發了財，至少要把口沬吐在侍者的臉上，把項貴的大菜吃了又吃。平日被人所踐踏凌辱不敢抗顏的人，一朝權在手，恩怨分　，某人當朝一品，某人殺頭充軍，串一本衣錦還鄕，給故舊一點顏色看看。英雄主義的對面，好像便是出氣主義。英雄旣是買中權力彩票的頭彩的人，出氣的對象，當然是我們老百姓。權力彩要不斷開出，中頭彩的英雄不斷產出，我們老百姓乃如磁器店的大小磁器，打了一批又打一批。</p>
<p>出了氣以後，那就怎樣呢？汽水出了汽，只　一碗冷水；燒酒出了氣，也只賸一碗冷水。磁器店夥計，時髦女郎，小職員，某夫婦，大家都租了洋樓，買了汽車，僱了許多男僕女役，打打牌，兜兜風，如斯而已。中權力頭彩的英雄，會有别的花樣嗎？</p>
<p>所以劉别謙，他决不敢做某一種的試探：或是每人分千元分給萬個人，或是每人分萬元，分給千個人。因爲那樣一做，不僅悲劇，喜劇，悲喜劇的錯綜交雜，非幾種　型所能包括，還暗示出另一種重大的意義來。</p>
<h3 id="c254">讀『文藝創作槪論』 <a href="#c254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— 寒琪</p>
<p>前幾天在『自由談』上看到有人主張根據底本改編的意見，心中頗以爲然。在先曾有以『毁滅』，『鐵流』等文學名著改編的大衆本出現。後來又聽見人說，韜奮編譯的『革命文豪高爾基』的以博得讀者大衆的歡迎，是因爲編者的文筆通俗化，大衆化的原故。現在，想作理論通俗化的華蒂君編述的『文藝創作槪論』又出版了。編者告訴我們，這書大體是根據川口浩著的『新興文學槪論』改編的。</p>
<p>首先，我們就得承認，改編這一工作，其本身就包含着大衆化的意義。因爲，至少讀改編的作品或理論，可使省去記一些和我國生活隔絶的『朶思托以夫斯基』的名字，以及看來頗費力的『場合』，『强調』的字眼，和有『修改可能的』長句和複雜的文法、這是由編而得的『形式』方面的好處。同時，改編的另一主要原因，以『新興文學槪論』來說，大體上這當然是一本好書，但是如果原本的選譯過來，内中徵引許多一向陌生的日本的作品，讀者非但莫名其妙，而且眞有『無興味』的感覺。所以只要改編者對原文有深切的理解，換上和原文的原則不衝突的確切的例子，『』在中國，如魯迅的一阿Ｑ正傳』；以及最近出版的茅盾的『子夜』等·····一樣可稱爲大形的小說。』像這句話，使讀者看來，讀過該書的旣可一目了然，未讀過的，但因徵引的是『中國』的例子，旣無生疏之感，由這徵引，更加燃燒想看『例子中的小說』的願望，那親切之感，便油然而生了。所以，我承認華蒂君的改編工作是極有意義的。</p>
<p>一向讀文藝理論的翻譯書籍，雖是極力用手指點着上下文句似的看，有時還是有『吃力』之感。說這句話，我對那書的譯者是不敢有絲毫不敬之意的。例如最近『賣力』讀完『普力汗諾夫批判』一文而感到『輕快』的時候，心中第一個念頭：『如果有人把這文章改編一下呵······那文章的影響恐怕更大吧，讀者恐怕會更多</p>
<p>吧。記得魯迅先生在『論翻譯』裡面，是承認有讀者層的。我想照經騐來分，高級讀者是那譯者，中級讀者是十分用功能讀懂譯文的人，而低級也卽是佔大多數的讀者，便是看不懂或難讀懂翻譯的，却飢餓地需要『精神糧食』的人。如果道分法大致不　　在這里，我們就能看到『改編』工作的重大意義。</p>
<p>在未談及『怎樣改編』以前，首先得承認改編是極其困難的工作，所謂『深入淺出』的把一部作品或理論改編一下，第一要完全澈底一領悟］原書的内容，其次才談得上如何用自己的淺白的話，簡單而正確的表現出來。老實說，對於近來編書的人（抄的不用說），有幾位是不敢領敎的。把某段譯文剪下來，上面加上『蒲力汗諾夫說：』，或把一段作品剪下來，上面加上幾句『槪念』的話：這表現小『布爾喬亞的意識』，沒有充分『把握』『主題的積極性』，某某的作品『對唯物　證法的無理解』，他必須『學習』辯法，『爲辯證法的方法鬥爭』····』像這樣『改編』不但浪費，簡直是『偷嬾』。用術語來說，只是證明這人對原來的理論『無理解』，『不消化』吧了。一個『作者』卽使想五體投地，也無法接受這位批評家的『鍼言』。『學習』，是的，怎樣學習呢？老實說，『學習』出之於一位自己也『無理解』的，使人不能『起敬意』的人之口，實在是有點『不能已於言』的。似乎那口　，那氣派，也有點使人難於『心服』。</p>
<p>話扯遠了，帶住。最後，我希望具有這種『槪念的』，『說敎的』改編者，幸忽再繼續『發展』他的毛病，雖然我并不敢『强調』他的『學習』。如果在這艱難的歲月中，能有幾本更其克苦改編的作品和理論的大衆本出現，我將是牠的忠實的讀者，愛護者。</p>
<h3 id="c255">嗡嗡之聲 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 南交</p>
<p>潯暑之夜，聞着和朋友們談天，嗡嗡的蚊聲在周圍打擾着，使人悶鬰於中，感到這日子過的不痛快。</p>
<p>把這感念擴大起來說，白天雖少有蚊子的嗡嗡之聲的打擾，但偶然偷閒把報紙打開一看，又何處不是一些嗡嗡之聲，使人看了感到不痛快。</p>
<p>先從世界說，世界經濟會議就在這嗡嗡之聲裏敲着喪鐘了，本來外交家政治家們的說話多麽嚮亮，但聚在一塊兒就和蚊的嗡嗡之聲一樣，試看從華盛頓會議到這回的世界經濟會議，幾曾有過一次說出了一句使世人感到痛快的話來。</p>
<p>回頭看看中華這國度里的情形那就更可憐了，軍閥們武裝着幾百萬無衣無食的游民，彼此描準着，都不響第一砲；官僚們削尖了腦袋掙營些民膏民脂，鴉雀無聲地抱着女人或烟槍兒過日子，</p>
<p>再有埋身在城市里的市僧們，天天有着種種爭風吃醋，刀砍槍殺的慘事；在另一角落里的災難者們，又有着賣妻　兒，茹毛飲血的悲景，如此等等，反映着這社會生活，這資本主義瀰留期的矛盾現象，是如何的顯明，這不生不死之局，又是何等的不痛快呵！</p>
<p>在資本主義瀰留期的矛盾的社會生活里，爲正義而奮鬥的戰鼓一時無聲了，嗡嗡之聲，蠅營狗苟地到處活響起來，感到生活不痛快的人們，也就揚棄了社會的正義，找刺激，走偏風；政壇上的黑暗，市塲上的傾詐，鼓動了全社會的人，閙個不休，這都是嗡嗡之聲籠罩下的一幅暗圖。</p>

<h3 id="c280">眼開口閉 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 珮瑜</p>
<p>眼開跟閉』是一句十足道地的俗語，『眼開口閉』不像是一句俗語。當然不是一句普通的俗語。不要小覷它，字雖只有四個，妙計却藏有不少，入得臥龍靑田的錦囊。這是處世的秘訣，爲人的妙法，可算得『至理名言』，『金科玉律』咧。註譯見下：</p>
<p>最近去世的一位英國著名的校長，生前曾經對他的受業門人，說過這樣的訓詞：『假使你要享人生的快樂，那麽眼睛，要張得開，嘴吧要閉得緊。』現在效學古人的縮字縮句的方法，便縮剩這『眼開口閉』四個字。『眼開］或［眼睛要張得開］，並不是敎你用以對付乞兒討錢或流氓拷詐，是敎你用以識人，辨物，觀色等。鐵證如下：</p>
<p>有一個僑居意大利的英國人，遵守了這位名校長的上半句訓詞，便成功一種很有價値的發明。原來在某休假日約了幾個朋友去爬山，山的周圍是出大理石的地方，他在山間爬來爬去，走上走下，眼睛張得很開，向四下　觀察。他的視線偶然移至一小片的岩石上，看去似乎是淡紅的顏色。他就走過去，把這塊石片拾起來，存細觀察，反覆審視，不料他越看越愛，越愛越看，樂得他手舞足蹈，喜得他心花奴放，弄得他的朋友莫名其妙，倒是驚駭不止。原來他所抬起的是一塊非常美麗的淡紅色大理石。結果他便在這裏開一石礦，專門採掘這種世上稀有的淡紅色大理石，採掘所得，數量甚鉅云。</p>
<p>至於名校長的下半句訓詞，並不十分新頴，我們的古人，早已有過意義類似的格言。字句雖不十分新頴，意義却是非常深刻。所謂『嘴吧要閉得緊』，决不是敎你　緊嘴唇，咬緊牙齒，不吃飯，不喝水，不開口，做隻『沒嘴猢猻』。誰也道這是『出言要謹愼』的敎訓，和『多吃飯少開口』的用意相同。際此亂離時代，皂白不分，是非難明，出言偶一不愼，頭顱馬上搬場的恐怖網中過生活，嘴吧尤其要閉得緊。</p>
<p>臨了，抄錄四句似是而非，不倫不類的摩登歌謠：眼睛張得開，弗怕今生不發財；嘴吧閉得緊，性命毋需保證金！</p>
<h3 id="c281">老婆與兒子 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>老婆是人家的好，兒子是自己的好』，若這話說得不算錯，那麽，咱眼珠子專對着『洋』字的中國人，怕不是『桃花運照命』，『天狗星坐宫』，只有『人家的好』的『老婆』『自己的好』的『兒子』。</p>
<p>『山歌』，『小調』，咱中國不是有『五更調』，『十八摸』，『小尼僧』等流傳得很廣麽？時髦些時，如『毛毛雨』『三蝴蝶』。再『可登大雅之堂』些的，如『荒山淚』，『光哭妻』之類。有的是『俗不傷雅』，有的是『哀而不怨』，多麽好，但是，不得，『郎呀』，『　呀』，據說夠不上西洋名曲『我愛你』。</p>
<p>就是樂器一道吧，『弦子』是算命，說書用的，『胡琴』是乞丐拉着討錢的『笙簫管笛』，就只可送給和尙，這士，送鬼，打醮。所以雖然是『梳妝台』，『哭七七』的調子，給『外國吹打』用洋鼓洋喇叭一奏，大家就覺得『有意思』。所以手裏提着『梵娥鈴』匣子，雖然裏面是空的，大家也會譽爲『摩登』，肅然起敬。說到了吃喝的東西，更是人家的好。同是一隻猪身上的肉、若是燒成『四喜肉』，『粉蒸肉』，便覺沒甚道理。若是燒得半生不熟，安在『在菜盆』裏。哈哈，『猪排，外國人吃的。』伺是用麥釀成</p>
<p>，而含有多量『酒精』的『酒』，『白蘭地』，『啤酒』，『考克推而』而多麽高貴，『元梁』，『高梁』，就只可給黃包車夫，羅宋乞丐喝。至於『麥燒，』，那更非加一個『臭』字不可。</p>
<p>談話，果不可不雜幾句『洋涇浜』，作文，更不可不雜幾個不是必必需的英文字。這麽便可表示出『說者』，『作者』的程度，至少是啃過『麵包邊』，當一名『高等華人』而無愧。若能把『洋裝』替代了『袍褂』，那更是一個『大拇指兒』。</p>
<p>總之，一切都是『人家的好』，沒一件是『自己的好。』只要『老婆』的沒有『兒子，』眞糟糕。</p>

<p>我的頭上，雖然戴着箸笠，我的上身和跨問，雖然披了層巴河布的</p>
<p>短衫和短褲，但沒有經過　鍊的皮膚，畢竟敵不過有透射性的陽光的薰逼，終於一　　的脫落表皮了。</p>
<p>我的兩居的踝　、雖然沒　在三四　深的汚泥　，但　部以上的膝，　，脛，腓諸部，還是被炎蒸蒸的太陽吻個不休，白潤的皮膚，已漸漸地變而爲粗黃色了。</p>
<p>我雖然知道我渾身的皮　，不久會和王老三的粗老的像黑牛皮似的皮膚同樣不怕太陽，但這時的熱烘烘的刺痛，巳　我這個初次脫離學校生活而至田間實習的孩子忍受了，而况，象徵着劍的有鋒芒的禾衣，還要不斷地向我的脛和腓厮殺。</p>
<p>，太陽這樣猛烈，長空這樣澄碧的天氣，繼續着將要經過半個月了，田土已由頹糜而漸呈膠固，田中的禾苗，也由靑翠而轉向萎黃，自然囉！我須得跟着我的大哥，二哥，三哥，白晝，夜間，駕着龍骨車，從長距離的小澗中或泉水窟裏，不絶地吸上少量的淸水，迢迢地引</p>
<p>到我们自己耕種的田裏，以灌漑田土，以　救那將要枯槁的禾苗。</p>
<p>泉水窟裏和小澗中的水，並不是取之不盡的東西，　乾了，須得等候它緩緩地積滿再　，有時，在全世界所有的一切都已睡熟的當兒，我們還在澗邊，塘上，阡陌間坐着，躺着候水。</p>
<p>稻子登塲了，曬乾，扇凈，田主們會不客氣的把我們所收穫的大部份搬了去，只留下少至不夠維持我們兩個月生活的給我們，『冬暖而兒號寒，年豐而妻啼飢』，這在我們佃農們看來，並不算什麽一回事。</p>
<p>我現在雖然在過着流浪的生活，但回憶到從前一度輟學在家耕種時。我要不寒而慄，我不敢附和那坐在高樓巨厦開着電扇做文章的作家所提倡的『到農村去』的高調，因爲農村已是年不如年，不是他們坐在東方巴黎的上海可能想像的啦！</p>

<p>不高興。其實據當兵的人，自己說起來，那一分可憐，簡直不是人。以後哨們見了大兵，多可憐可憐人家罷。桂枝道；您這樣沒頭沒腦，說上一陣子，究竟爲的什麽，我倒有些不懂。江氏想了一想，笑起來道：我是一肚子的話，　不住了，所以一見你的面就說起來。你猜怎麽着，瞎！他在不曾說</p>
<p>出肚子裏的話以先，又是這樣很凄愴的慨歎着。桂枝知道母親是個心軟的人，這必定是那個人說了一些苦話，所以引起了他一肚子的慈悲，若是只管問母親，這話一定更長，就低了頭不再去和母親說了。在這天晚上江氏又到後面院子裏去看這病人，而且在箱子裏尋了一雙舊棉襪子送給盛世民。因爲這是男人的襪子放在箱子裏，也是白放着。今天撞上趙翁家裏煑羊肉餃子，一定也要江氏在那裏吃，而且把桂枝也呌了去。那個盛世民在暖和的屋子裏休養了半天，精神好得多。當兵的人，正個月不見着一回肉，見了餃子，口水直流。趙翁也讓他在藤椅子上，半躺半坐的，吃了兩碗餃子。他肚子吃飽子，病越發是减除了，閑着無事，就和大家談談軍隊受苦的情形。他談了兩三小時，不但是談到江氏母女替大兵可憐，就可趙翁把兒子充軍人衛護國土的念頭，也有些冰冷。（一四五）</p>

<p>After Beiping released a joint telegram in the names of Wang and Chiang, expressing their views on the Chahar incident, the situation took a sharp turn. Deng Zhexi and others had previously jointly telegraphed Feng, proposing several plans, and stating that in this environment, they hoped Feng could retreat bravely. Yesterday, Feng replied to Beiping, saying that he would proceed as planned, and declaring that at this time of national crisis, starting another civil war would be a path to national ruin, and that the guns of the anti-Japanese army would never be pointed inward. Upon receiving Feng's telegram, it was believed that there might be a turning point for peace, and Deng Zhexi was immediately invited to Beiping to negotiate. Deng arrived in Beiping this afternoon, and after getting off the train, he immediately met with Song, Qin Dechun, and Xiong Bin to discuss everything. Xiong then went to see He, to convey Feng's intentions. Depending on Feng's intentions, further peace measures will be determined. Song had not been involved in the Chahar incident for half a month, but now that the situation has eased somewhat, Feng can cancel the title, and the government will be lenient.

<p>Chu Minyi...Xinjiang Issue. Zhang Ji...The Preparation Process of Xijing (Nanjing) The Central Committee held the Premier's Memorial Week at 8 AM on the 31st. Ju Zheng, Ye Chucang, Chu Minyi, Ji Liang, Gu Zhenggang, Fang Juehui, Zheng Zhannan, and staff members attended. Ju Zheng chaired the meeting, and Chu Minyi reported on the Xinjiang issue, stating that he had been to Xinjiang once in the twentieth year of the Republic of China and drafted a plan for developing the Northwest based on his observations, and presented it to the Third Plenary Session of the Central Committee. When the Xinjiang incident occurred, the people of the country realized the importance of the Xinjiang issue. After Zuo Zongtang pacified Xinjiang in the past, he immediately proposed to change it to a province, and the government allocated a certain amount of funds every year, which shows the importance of Xinjiang. Although Yang Zengxin presided over Xinjiang after the Revolution of 1911, it is a pity that he did not make any achievements in political and religious affairs, and Jin Shuren also followed suit. Moreover, due to the manipulation of unscrupulous elements, public opinion was not harmonious, leading to today's incident. It has recently been heard that it has eased, and all parts of Southern and Northern Xinjiang have sent telegrams supporting the Central Government, and it will be resolved soon. However, the fundamental method of governing Xinjiang is to develop the Northwest, and the way to develop it is to build roads and water conservancy to facilitate transportation. The plan I drafted two years ago mainly advocated the establishment of a Northwest Construction Committee, with separate National Highway Bureau, Industrial Bureau, Mining Exploration Bureau, and Reclamation Bureau to specialize in various tasks. I hope that the people of the country will pay more attention to the development of the Northwest in the future. (Central News Agency telegram on the 31st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held the Premier's Memorial Week at 8 AM on the 31st. Yu Youren, Li Yuanding, Lin Xiang, He Yaozu, Chu Minyi, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and more than 400 National Government staff members attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. National Government member Zhang Ji reported on the preparation process of Xijing. First, he explained the importance of Xijing from the perspectives of politics, economy, history, and geography. In order to promote the spirit of the nation and improve national culture, it is urgent to build Xijing. Since the establishment of the Xijing Preparatory Committee by the Central Committee, active preparations have been made, and a clue has been revealed. Chiang and Wang are very enthusiastic and promised to make appropriate arrangements for funding. The Ministry of Railways has recently accelerated the completion of the Tongxi section. Once transportation is convenient, it can be gradually developed. I have proposed to Director Dai that a Xijing tomb-sweeping group should be organized every Qingming Festival in the future, so that the people of the whole country can worship the ancestors of the nation, such as the tombs of the Duke of Zhou and Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, to inspire the national character, and I hope that students in school can actively participate, because education in recent times is accustomed to Westernization,</p>
<p>And the inherent virtues of the nation are gradually forgotten. It is extremely dangerous to talk about education away from the national character. Also, at the beginning of the construction of Xijing, it is planned to establish Xi'an as a city, and the candidates for mayor should be selected from the Northwest people who are both talented and virtuous. The establishment of Xijing is still in its infancy, and I hope that all comrades will work together to help its development. (Central News Agency telegram on the 31st)</p>

<p>And He was Kidnapped and Sent to the Japanese Consulate, and Released Only After Being Covered in Wounds (Xiamen) Wu Zhaokang, the quartermaster of the teaching regiment of the 61st Division of the 19th Route Army, was attacked on the morning of the 31st. Later, because the car he was riding in was hit, he had a conflict with the Taiwanese driver Gao Fenggu of the Taiwanese-owned Nanxing Motor Company. A group of Taiwanese surrounded and beat Wu. Wu accidentally fired his gun, and the bullet pierced Gao's right palm. Then, more than ten Taiwanese went to beat him severely and locked him in the Nanxing Motor Company, confiscated his gun, and transported Wu to the Japanese consulate in a car. In the self-established police department, the public security bureau sent personnel to lead him out of the Japanese police department, and he was already covered in wounds. The police officers at the scene did not dare to rescue him and allowed him to be detained and sent on his own. The Japanese police arrested one Taiwanese person, Chen, after the incident. The Japanese consul limited him to be released at 4 PM. Lin Hongfei said that he needed to ask the headquarters for instructions, but he was not released until late. Also, the household registration of the Nanxing public security bureau is not Taiwanese, but Japanese. The Japanese consul's request was not approved. (Special dispatch on the 31st)</p>

If there are unavoidable difficulties, they can also be accommodated to a certain extent. The intention is to find a way out for him. His subordinates are all Sichuan troops.

<p>Awaits the Final Decision of the Fifth Plenary Session. (Nanjing) Regarding the issue of the Ministry of Justice's affiliation, according to relevant authorities, the Central Political Committee did discuss this issue, but it was not officially announced, leading to the misconception that it was affiliated with the Executive Yuan. However, the resolution of the Central Political Committee should not be considered the final decision, because the decision to change the affiliation of the Judicial Yuan to the Executive Yuan was made by the Second Plenary Session of the Central Committee. Therefore, the Central Political Committee will submit a proposal to the upcoming Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee for a final decision. As for what is stipulated in the first draft of the constitution, it is to make due provisions for the future constitutional system, and then decide on it at the National Assembly. But this is a matter for the constitutional period, and the political system of the tutelage period stipulated by the Central Political Committee is parallel and not contradictory.

Ge said that he came to Jinan to thank Han on behalf of Mayor Shen for his kind invitation to stay. He will return to Qingdao in two or three days. Mayor Shen was welcomed back by all circles in Qingdao, but his intention to resign has not been dispelled, and he has not yet gone to the city government to work. Because the difficult problem is still the navy, although the central government has appointed Xie Gangzhe as the commander of the Third Fleet, there are still more than 400 people who escaped from the three fleeing ships left in Qingdao, and there is no way to settle them. Shen is unwilling to settle all of them in the city government. The central government and Chairman Chiang are very eager to retain Shen and have sent Wang Rutang to personally convey this intention. Chairman Chiang also sent a telegram to Shen, saying that if there are any difficulties, he can raise them, but Shen is still determined to leave. The Jiaoji Railway Council decided that starting this year, it will raise 2 million yen per month to fill the road redemption fund. Because the Jiaoji Railway has a monthly surplus of about 2 million, which is used for purchasing materials, it will no longer be used for other purposes in the future and will be used exclusively as a road redemption fund. The Road Bureau also plans that the current assets in the bureau are worth 70 to 80 million, and it plans to issue 65 million in public bonds, with 40 million to redeem the road and 25 million to build a branch line connecting Tongzhangde and the Pinghan Road. It is estimated that the public bonds can be paid off after 25 years. Currently, it is the off-season, and the daily revenue is only 20,000 silver dollars.

<p>(Nanjing) Zheng Tianxi, Political Vice-Minister of the Judicial Administration Department, returned to his hometown to visit relatives and recently returned to Nanjing. On the 31st, he spoke about his excellent impressions of visiting courts and prisons in Hong Kong. The Hong Kong judicial organs are divided into two levels within the court of first instance: (1) the Magistracy, roughly equivalent to the summary court of our country's primary court, and (2) the Supreme Court, roughly equivalent to our country's District Court. He had attended court hearings and observed that the handling of cases was extremely simple and quick. Cases in the Magistracy were mostly prosecuted by the police, who would file charges with the municipal government within 24 hours of the arrest. The complaints were extremely simple. The procedures in the Supreme Court were more complex, and the complaints had to list the nationality of the defendant, the facts of the crime, and the evidence. Insufficient evidence would result in an unfavorable judgment. Unlike our country, evidence could not be submitted during the court hearing. The qualifications of judges and lawyers were very strict. Lawyers were divided into two types: barristers, who could appear in court to argue cases, and solicitors, who mostly helped parties with legal matters. The conditions in Hong Kong's prisons were also good, with excellent material and sanitary facilities. Attention was paid to work, and the factory products were very good. Doctors were available to treat prisoners, who were mostly opium and theft offenders. Newly convicted criminals could not be accommodated, and new prisons were being planned. In short, Hong Kong's laws and practices were modeled after the British system and were well-established, offering many areas for us to learn from, he said. (31st Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Resisting the Forces of Various Countries, Forming the Japan-"Manchukuo"-North China Economic Alliance, Establishing Protective Policies for Heavy Industry, and Seeking Outlets for Light Industry Overseas.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and Ministry of Colonial Affairs are enthusiastically studying economic policies after Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the failure of the World Economic Conference. This time, an Economic Committee has been organized to unify this research and determine the fundamental countermeasures. The so-called "Economic Nationalism" is the underlying principle. After the failure of the World Economic Conference, it is clear that various countries are adopting extreme nationalist policies. Therefore, Japan's domestic economic policy is to organize an economic alliance between Japan, Manchuria, and North China, and to establish protective policies for petroleum, steel, and other important industries, in preparation for national defense and a self-sufficiency doctrine. The outlet for light industrial products such as cotton textiles and rayon will be overseas, striving to obtain new markets. (31st Japan Associated Press dispatch)</p>

Other important Japanese and "Manchukuo" figures serve as advisors. According to President Azasa, the breakdown of the London Economic Conference will inevitably divide the world into several economic alliances. In order to counter this trend, Japan and Manchuria need to expand the power of the Japan-Manchuria economic alliance, with the urgent goal of forming an East Asian economic alliance.

In addition, raw silk exports were the highest since late October last year, and cotton textile exports also occupied a considerable advantage. The main commodities imported and exported were as follows: (Exports) Raw silk 17.042 (unit: 1,000 yen), cotton textiles 11.612, silk fabrics 1.674; (Imports) cotton 21.689 (31st Dentsu dispatch)</p>

<p>Uchida's Statement to the Nation:</p>
<p>With International Status Unstable, it is Necessary to Consolidate Overseas Commercial Rights.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This afternoon, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a provincial meeting, at which the next year's budget was decided. Minister of Foreign Affairs Uchida approved it and handed it over to the Ministry of Finance. The formal announcement is as follows: At the occasion of Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations, we are ever more aware of the importance of diplomacy. The Emperor also issued a grand rescript. The government, based on the great spirit of the rescript, must correct foreign misunderstandings about Japan, and it is necessary to propagate Japanese culture overseas. Japan will aid the development of "Manchukuo", adjust Sino-Japanese problems to eliminate the root of disaster in East Asia, allow other countries to correctly understand Japan's position, increase friendship with other countries, and take on the responsibility of ensuring the international status and peace of the Orient, all of which are Japan's urgent tasks. Considering Japan's current situation, diplomacy must aim to promote the economic advancement of the Japanese Empire. As Japanese commercial rights are being rejected in various overseas regions, threatening to destabilize them, we have no choice but to persist in these regions and seek progress. At the present international standing of Japan, it is an extraordinary time for economic diplomacy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will make its best efforts to achieve the above objectives, as it is its responsibility to the country and its citizens. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also keenly aware of the need for appropriate organization and improvement of current scale and facilities. Compared to those of European and American countries, the budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is only one-seventh of that of France, one-fifth of that of the United Kingdom, one-third of that of the United States and Italy, and one-half of that of Germany. The next year's budget focuses on establishing commercial rights and expanding only what is urgently needed. (31st Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The total budget of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for the next year reaches 37 million yen, including 22 million yen for regular expenses and 15 million yen for temporary expenses. The total amount of newly established business expenses reaches 20 million yen, including:</p>
<p>"Manchurian Incident Expenses" 8,000 (unit: 1,000 yen) "Exchange Rate Loss" 6,000, "Newly Established Items" 6,050, including the International Cultural Bureau 1,700, Manmong Bureau 100, Overseas Japanese Bureau 100, Newly established embassies in five countries 7,500, including Afghanistan, Abyssinia, Columbia, Egypt, and the South African Federation; newly established consulates in nine locations 800, including Chengde, Heihe, Suifenhe, Tongliao, Tunan, Karachi in India, Beirut in Syria, Tawau in Borneo, and one location in Brazil; increased budget for one section of the European and American Bureau 50, promotion of commerce and trade 1,500, improvement of telecommunications affairs 100, increased supplementary expenses and subsidies 500. (31st Dentsu dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Ministry today submitted a draft of its new budget to the Ministry of Finance. The basic budget is 216 million yen, and the new budget is 184 million yen. This includes 140 million yen for new military equipment manufacturing, 6 million yen for new soldier education, 3 million yen for improvement of military preparations, 5 million yen for fuel research, 30 million yen for rewards for the troops invading China, and other expenses such as those related to the Manchurian Incident, which are currently being discussed by the Army Ministry and the General Staff Headquarters. These expenses are estimated to be 145 million yen, bringing the total expenses to 545 million yen. (31st Hualian dispatch)</p>

<p>Turkey's state religion is Islam, and in the past, women who went out were always veiled. In recent years, the liberation of women has been implemented, and female talents have emerged in large numbers. They are completely different from those of the past who only knew how to fast, pray, and knew nothing else. Recently, Ms. Mirik graduated from the engineering department with excellent results. Ms. Mirik is proficient in bridge and road construction engineering, so she currently holds an important position in the water conservancy bureau in Istanbul.

<p>(Nanjing) Jiufu Island in Pukou is located on the riverside and has a strategic position. In order to develop the town and make it an important commercial port, the municipal government has planned to develop Jiufu Island and is consulting with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Bureau. Jiufu Island is located downstream of Pukou, facing Xiaguan across the river. It is connected to the Shanghai-Nanjing and Tianjin-Pukou railways, making it a hub for water and land transportation. In terms of military transportation, if roads are built to connect directly with the seven-province highway, it would be mutually beneficial with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. Pukou currently has ten wharves, which are only sufficient for loading and unloading ships. As Pukou's shipping industry develops in the future, imported goods from foreign trade should be directly loaded, unloaded, and transshipped here. After ocean-going ships arrive here, they can also be transported north from here. Only one or two of the ten wharves are sufficient for berthing heavily loaded and deep-drafted ocean-going ships. The rest are only sufficient for berthing shallow-drafted ships. It is now planned to build two wharves along the old Kaihe River, which can accommodate ocean-going ships for berthing and transshipment of goods, as well as connecting ferries. A storm shelter and dry dock will also be built on the north shore for berthing and repairs. The mouth of the old Kaihe River is wide and is a natural storm shelter. The original river will be slightly dredged to make it suitable for use. (31st Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e72">Prospects After the Suspension of the World Economic Conference <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Over sixty countries around the world. Aside from a few small countries that cannot assert themselves, only about a dozen countries' words and actions are influential enough to affect the world. At the beginning of this World Economic Conference, representatives from the sixty-six participating nations all held extremely enthusiastic hopes, bringing the belief in international cooperation to London. Regarding issues such as currency stability, tariff truce, and producer coordination, they hoped to understand each other and reach relatively concrete decisions under the principles of mutual benefit and concession, in order to overcome the current difficulties and open up new paths for economic recovery. However, these dozen or so major countries each harbored selfish intentions and failed to candidly discuss matters sincerely. Therefore, at the very beginning of the conference, some irreparable flaws occurred, and the progress of the conference was fraught with difficulties and impossible to proceed. As the conference was about to adjourn in late July, some believed that the conference was not well prepared and opened too early. The countries had not been able to reach sufficient understanding in advance, so once conflicting situations were discovered in the conference hall regarding actual interests, it was not easy to start reconciliation. However, in fact, since the Lausanne Conference in June of last year, preliminary contacts had already been made regarding the important issues in this conference. A year's time cannot be said to be short. Furthermore, US President Roosevelt, at the beginning of his inauguration in March of this year, also invited eleven major countries of the time to hold talks in Washington. His efforts to seek understanding in advance cannot be said to be detailed and thorough. Therefore, the real reason for the failure of this conference lies not in the timing, but in the fact that each country is actively seeking ways to escape the economic panic and disregarding the common interests of the international community.</p>
<p>In recent years, world transportation has become increasingly developed. The distance across the oceans and the separation between land, mountains, and rivers have become increasingly closer. The relationship between countries has also become increasingly close and inseparable. International cooperation is necessary to benefit the world. However, historical legacies are too deep, and the habit of national and ethnic self-interest cannot be eliminated in a short period of time. At a time when this global economic panic is deepening and social life is generally difficult, major capitalist countries are all committed to their own construction, seeking economic self-sufficiency. Regarding overseas relations, they only seek to expand markets and utilize investments. However, all countries of the world cannot escape the interconnectedness of international interests, and narrow-minded nationalism in politics has already emerged, and its reflection in economic relations is also very serious. Therefore, before the United States even began to convene the Washington talks, it abandoned the gold standard in order to seek the understanding and cooperation of Britain and France. The hidden reefs between nations were thereby concealed, and the war debt problem was also lying in the way. Therefore, the European countries had a united front against the United States.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that differences of opinion occurred during the conference and led to its suspension. However, during the course of this conference, there were two new trends that deserve our attention. The first is the deterioration of British-Japanese relations. Its source began with the Ottawa Conference, and became even more serious after India and Africa increased import taxes on cotton products. This is the so-called economic alliance within the British Empire. Japan believes that this kind of economic hostility from Britain is enough to put Japan in a difficult situation. Therefore, the Greater Asia Doctrine has revived, taking the opportunity to include our entire country in the [Japan-Manchuria] economic alliance. If it seeks to extend its influence to the Yangtze River, the new conflict between Britain and Japan will become increasingly sharp. The second is the opposition between Britain and the United States, from South American countries to Canada, from industrial management to financial investment, everywhere showing an irreconcilable situation. Added to the entanglement of war debt problems, the deteriorating situation is further intensified. However, in the Western Pacific, Japan is acting recklessly, exclusively dominating hegemony. If the United States wants to open up new markets, it will be subject to extremely serious restrictions, or even have no possibility of development. Britain's existing economic strength has also been taken with an aggressive offensive by Japan so it is not only unable to move forward, but also fears that it will gradually shrink. Therefore, there is a possibility for Britain and the United States to reach a temporary understanding, jointly confronting Japan in the East, or even opening up a new situation in another way, which is also unknown.</p>
<p>The European situation, in the last forty days or so, can be said to have taken on a new look. From the perspective of the entire Old World countries, there is a tendency towards the United States. However, among them, the Soviet Union has established a separate banner outside of capitalism. The hatred between France and Germany is also incomprehensible. Germany and Italy are temporarily close due to practical interests. France will also unite Central European countries such as Poland, Czechoslovakia, and Yugoslavia to resist. The difficulty is that Europe's natural resources have been almost completely developed. In the future, nationalism will prevail, and it will be increasingly difficult to</p>
<p>be self-reliant. Therefore, the focus of world disputes, in politics, will shift from the Balkans to the Far East. The contradictions of the great powers themselves and their secret struggles against the Soviet Union will all center on the Far East issue, and they will implement their strategic tactics. In the economy, only the Chinese market has much room for development. Then, the competition in the future will also take our country as a battlefield, and carry out their bloody and non-bloody contests. How will our people respond to this situation? Will they still follow the Qing court's policy of sitting on the sidelines during the Russo-Japanese War? Or will they follow Turkey's lead and rise up as a new country in the Far East? It is up to our people to plan for themselves.</p>

<p>Future Situation in the Pacific</p>
<h3 id="e74">The United States Does Not Abandon Military Bases <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>The opposition faction wins the Philippine Senate vote on independence (Manila) Based on various indications here today, the Philippine Independence Act passed by the US Congress will definitely be rejected by the Filipinos. If they reject it, the realization of Philippine independence will inevitably be delayed for decades. Those in the United States who support Philippine independence have clearly stated the pros and cons to the Filipinos, but the majority of Filipinos who oppose the bill still appear to be in the majority. According to Senator Quezon, the leader of the rejection faction, the main reasons for their opposition are: first, the United States will still use the island as a naval and military base. This action means that the United States still holds the power to control the island in practice. Second, the ten-year preparatory period is too long, and during this preparatory period, Philippine trade with the United States will be subject to unfair restrictions. Therefore, it is better to reject this bill and seek a more beneficial independence plan. Even if it cannot be fulfilled, it is better to temporarily belong to the United States. On the other hand, those who advocate acceptance are led by Senator Osmena and former Speaker of the House Roxas. They believe that the US Congress has firmly stated that if the Filipinos reject this bill or make reservations, they will believe that the Filipinos do not want independence and will not discuss it further. Moreover, leaders who previously supported Philippine independence, such as Hawes, are no longer in Congress. They fear that the opportunity will be lost, so it is better to accept it. However, there are few legislators who support this faction, so Roxas lost the Speaker of the House due to the exclusion of the rejection faction. Today, Senator Osmena resigned as the leader of the independence faction in the parliament. At the same time, the Speaker of the Senate Quezon also requested to resign in order to test the Senate's position on this bill. However, the result was rejected by a vote of sixteen to five, and it was stated that they had absolute trust. Therefore, the Senate situation at this time can be said to be completely clear. As for the House of Representatives, there has not yet been a final action on the test vote, but its trend is not difficult to foresee. (31st National News)</p>

<p>Our envoy submits a written protest (London) When British troops were drilling in Balton Hants, a regiment of soldiers acted out the pursuit of (Chinese) bandits. The Chinese Embassy in the UK believes that British troops should not mention the word [China] in their exercises, so they submitted a written protest to the British Foreign Office. (31st Havas News) (London) The British Borden Camp recently held an exercise in which the word [China] was used in a mocking manner. The regiment had a section in a non-public exercise on defeating the Chinese bandit team led by the so-called generals [Yu Yu] and [Ren Fu]. The Chinese Embassy in the UK has filed a written protest over this matter. The Chinese Embassy stated that before the Borden incident, a Chinese pirate ship was included in the Portsmouth Naval Exhibition. At that time, the embassy lodged an oral protest, and the Navy Department deleted the word [China]. Unexpectedly, this incident has happened again. It is now heard that the British will declare that they will no longer use the (Chinese) word in future exercises. (31st Reuters)</p>

<h3 id="e78">The Future of War: Poison Gas is Terrifying <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>Turkey trains people to use masks. We have experienced the pain of airplanes and should also plan for it early. Reuters Stanbol (Old Capital of Turkey) dispatch, It is almost generally recognized that air force will occupy an extremely important part in future wars. Bombs dropped by the air force are certainly terrifying, but they are not as devastating as gas bombs. Therefore, countries have recently been practicing the use of gas masks in peacetime, partly to prepare for emergencies and partly to make the public familiar with them so that they will not be alarmed in an emergency. In view of this, the Turkish government has ordered that every man, woman, and child in the country must have a gas mask and know how to use it. Before the government made this decision, military experts tested ten anti-gas methods and selected the best one. The Turkish Red Cross also allocated 60,000 Turkish pounds (approximately 83,000 British pounds) for this purpose and will train Turks on how to use masks.</p>
<p>Translator's note: China always lags behind others in everything and then rushes to embrace the Buddha's feet, which is its specialty. For example, after suffering the pain of airplanes in recent years, it began to realize the importance of airplanes, which can be taken as a sign. In future wars, poison gas will be a necessary item. It can be seen from the fact that European and American countries are competing to manufacture this item and store it for use. If poison gas bombs are carried by airplanes and dropped from the air, the entire city can be wiped out, which is a hundred times more devastating than bombs. During the Battle of Shanghai in previous years, some people paid attention to the anti-gas mask, but after the event passed, everyone forgot about it. The authorities did not promote it from above, and the people no longer paid attention to it, which is a great pity.</p>

<p>Willing to lend money for increased investment in various industries. Treasury issues short-term bonds of 500 million. National Press Agency 30th New York Electric Eleven of America's largest banks, including the New York National City Bank and Chase National Bank, today notified General Johnson, the administrator of the industrial recovery program, that they will cooperate with the government and provide the most complete assistance to various industries that need to increase capital in order to comply with the government's industrial recovery plan. According to these industrial and commercial foundations, they are all completely consolidated, but due to the long-term impact of the economic recession, profits have decreased, and current funds are insufficient. With the assistance of banks, they can accept the National Industrial General Regulations, increase the number of employees, and reduce working hours. According to some banks, European financial institutions are closely watching the progress of the American Industrial Recovery Administration and have requested that American agents provide detailed reports. Some have indicated that the best parts of the American plan may be imitated in Europe. It is also heard that the money that American merchants have deposited abroad after settling their accounts is currently being transported back to the country because they are aware that the financial situation has become much more stable recently, and it is expected that the industrial and commercial situation will continue to improve. It is also expected that banks in various parts of the United States will follow in the footsteps of the New York banking community and assist industrial and commercial businesses by lending them the necessary loans. National Press Agency 30th Washington Electric The US government today announced that the progress of industries and the development of unemployment relief programs has made it possible for ordinary wage earners to have surplus funds to invest in securities. Therefore, the Treasury will issue 500 million yuan of new short-term bonds tomorrow to repay the maturing old bonds and will reduce the face value to a minimum of 50 yuan to facilitate subscription by those who earn little. The financial community expects that there will be an oversubscription for these new bonds. Previously, the Treasury issued 100 million yuan of treasury bills on June 11, and the subscribers actually exceeded 240 million yuan.

<p>Establishing a Minister Without Portfolio. The Seiyukai's radical faction expresses opposition. Negotiations still have considerable twists and turns. Japanese Union Press 31st Tokyo Electric In order for the government to successfully pass the next parliament, it plans to invite Seiyukai President Suzuki and Minseito President Wakatsuki to join the cabinet and appoint Ministers Without Portfolio. The previous time, it entrusted Finance Minister Takahashi to negotiate this matter with Suzuki. Although Suzuki refused at the time, Prime Minister Saito's faction is determined to realize the establishment of Ministers Without Portfolio, paying attention to the internal situation of the Seiyukai and starting formal negotiations with Suzuki at the appropriate time. According to the government's observation, the situation around September or October will make it impossible for Suzuki to refuse to join the cabinet, so the Minister Without Portfolio is very likely to be realized.</p>
<p>News Agency 31st Tokyo Electric When former Prime Minister Saito asked Finance Minister Takahashi to ask Suzuki Seiyukai President to join the cabinet, he</p>
<p>was rejected. Later, the Prime Minister persuaded him to show the reality of national unity, and he agreed to consider it. Recently, the self-respecting faction within the Seiyukai believes that assisting the government by joining the cabinet as a Minister Without Portfolio is essential for the future of the Seiyukai and asked President Suzuki to consider it. As a result, President Suzuki also expressed his agreement, so his attitude towards the government has recently improved slightly. The government is quite optimistic about this, saying that when Prime Minister Saito meets President Suzuki in September and asks for an answer to his previous request, the Seiyukai will not hold a strong attitude, and the negotiations for joining the cabinet will be established without any loss of face. However, the Seiyukai has the problem of Suzuki President's stated principle of right and wrong, and the hardliners will inevitably rise up to oppose it. It is expected that, contrary to the government's optimism, Suzuki President will realize his entry into the cabinet so simply too early. In short, the realization of Suzuki President's entry into the cabinet still requires considerable twists and turns, and the atmosphere in the political world will inevitably lead to a compromise.</p>
<p>Japanese Union Press 31st Tokyo Electric The Minseito hopes that Seiyukai President Suzuki will abandon his usual fence-sitting policy and join the cabinet as a Minister Without Portfolio, then Wakatsuki of the Minseito will also join the cabinet. However, if the Seiyukai sends Suzuki's agent to join the cabinet, it will resolutely express its opposition.</p>

<p>According to the Osaka Mainichi Newspaper of July 20th, recently, the number of foreign military attaches coming to Japan under the guise of tourism has suddenly increased. According to investigations by the military police authorities, from January to June of this year, the number of people coming to Japan in this six-month period totaled 152 from Country A, 62 from Country B, and 18 from other countries. Calculated by month, there were 19 in January, 20 in February, 26 in March, 45 in April, 86 in May, and 36 in June.

However, in order to reorganize the museum's affairs, Ma first telegraphed Xu Hongbao, a council member of the museum in Peiping, to be the secretary-general. Xu arrived at the museum at 10 a.m. on the 28th to take up his duties and convened a meeting of the staff to give instructions. On the 29th, Xu and senior staff discussed various important issues.

<p>Today (the 29th) at 10 a.m., Xu Hongbao invited Secretary Wu Ying for a conversation in the Secretary-General's office to discuss handover procedures. The Palace Museum has too many treasures. Due to the tense situation in the past, apart from the 14,000 crates of antiquities transported south, the number of antiquities remaining in Peiping is difficult to count. Although there is an inventory, it is quite difficult to verify. The starting point for the handover in the future, whether it will be one palace or several palaces simultaneously, and the supervisory personnel, handover personnel, etc., all need to be considered in advance. Most of the antiquities from the east and west routes have been transported away, making handover easier. The central route has a large number of antiquities, making it difficult to hand over. After three hours of confidential discussion, the basic principles of the handover were decided. However, detailed and specific measures still need to be referred to the acting director, Ma Heng.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Branch System <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the establishment of branch museums of the Palace Museum, Zhang Ji, a member of the Western Capital Preparatory Committee, advocated that all the documents and books from the museum's Literature and Documents Library should be moved to Xi'an. However, quite a few central committee members opposed this proposal. The branch museum system will be discussed at the next council meeting, which is expected to be held in Nanjing in September. Council members Sun Ke, Zhu Jiahua, Gu Mengyu, Ju Zheng, Wu Dingchang, Ye Gongchuo, Liu Shouzhong, Qian Yongming, Chu Minyi, Shi Liangcai, Zhou Zuomin, Ye Chucang, and Zhang Jia'ao are expected to attend. After the council decides on a plan, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. Branch museums will be established in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Xi'an. The antiquities displayed in the branch museums will be limited to duplicate items from the Palace Museum that have been reviewed by experts and deemed suitable for display in different locations. However, this must wait until a detailed catalog is published and reviewed before they can be moved. As for the items allocated by the Palace Museum Council to the branch museums, a detailed catalog should be compiled and published under the names of the council and the branch museums. However, the establishment of the Xi'an branch museum is extremely difficult. The government has no large funds allocated for construction costs, and it is not easy for the Xi'an administrative agencies and academia to raise funds for construction. Even if construction is possible, the architectural form and plan must first be deemed appropriate by the Palace Museum Council before construction can begin. Only after the buildings are completed can the antiquities be moved. The problem of the premises for the Shanghai and Nanjing branch museums is also not easy to solve. (July 29th, Jin)</p>

Commander-in-Chief He Jian believes that with the large army penetrating deep into Jiangxi, the security of Hunan Province is extremely important. Therefore, he submitted a request to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and Minister He for approval to have Li Jue, commander of the 19th Division, act as the security commander and deputy commander of the entire province, responsible for maintaining security within Hunan Province. All of the 19th Division and the Li Guojun Brigade of the 62nd Division, the Chen Zixian Brigade of the 63rd Division, the Hunan Provincial Capital Garrison Commander and its subordinate units, all water and land police agencies in Hunan Province related to military affairs, and armored vehicle teams, etc., are under his command and dispatch. Li Jue was ordered to report to the headquarters immediately to take over and assume responsibility. However, He's plan to suppress bandits focuses on winning back the people. Young men and women who have been misled by bandits or local people who have been coerced into working for the bandits will be allowed to surrender and turn over a new leaf, without being held accountable for the past, and will be guaranteed safety, as a radical solution. Therefore, before departing, he issued a proclamation ordering all units to post it in the bandit areas. At the same time, a propaganda team was organized, with Li Shaoling, the head of the Party Affairs Section of the Party and Government Department of the headquarters, concurrently serving as the team leader, to depart with the army immediately for propaganda, in order to achieve practical results. The following is an excerpt from He's proclamation: [Now that the army is suppressing bandits to save the people, all our troops will strictly abide by discipline, without any disturbances, get along with the people, and maintain a peaceful attitude of fair buying and selling. You can all live and work in peace, without having to move or relocate, and without causing unnecessary alarm. If any young men and women have been misled by bandits or local people have been coerced into working for the bandits, this commander-in-chief will be lenient. As long as you realize your mistakes and turn back, quickly surrender and turn over a new leaf, and we will never hold you accountable for your past crimes. If you can expose the secrets of the bandits or surrender with weapons, you will be rewarded heavily. This is hereby announced, hoping that you will persuade each other to leave the bandit party and return in good faith. If there are any who are stubborn and resist to the end, when the army arrives, they will be severely punished without leniency. Now, the important conditions are listed below for the public to understand: (1) Amnesty for those who surrender and turn over a new leaf for their past crimes, and private retaliation is prohibited. (2) Guarantee the lives of those who surrender and turn over a new leaf, and all legal rights and obligations. (3) Protect the property of local residents, and distribute the grain seized from the bandits to the residents. (4) Provide relief grain to returning residents or allocate land for them to cultivate. (5) All old debts and land taxes before the 21st year of the Republic in the bandit areas will be waived. (6) Heavy rewards will be given to those who surrender with weapons or report bandit information. (7) Those who surrender in groups with weapons will have their leaders promoted, and those who follow will be heavily rewarded. (8) Those who are injured in battle or who are sick and cannot get medical treatment will be sent to the hospital for treatment. (9) The army will never [leave] until the scattered bandits are eliminated and the area is at peace. (10) Organizing a Communist eradication volunteer team is a good way to defend against the trampling of the Communist bandits, and it is not to conscript you or raise funds. (11) Strict household registration checks in various places are to prevent the Communist bandits from secretly organizing and the bandits from staying behind. (12) Those who pretend to surrender but secretly work for the bandits will be killed. (13) Those who collude with the army to spy on military intelligence will be killed. (14) Those who communicate with the bandits or smuggle goods to the bandit areas will be killed. (15) Those who damage power lines, roads, and military works will be killed. The top eight items give you great benefits, and the top seven items are necessary measures to protect the locality. This commander-in-chief loves the people like his own children, and sincerely explains, hoping that you will all advise your fathers and sons, brothers, and neighbors, and turn away from your former mistakes and become good people together. This commander-in-chief has great expectations. ] (July 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e102">Current Financial Situation in Hubei Province <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Sharp Decline in Revenue, Only 30% of Land Tax Collected, Living on Borrowed Money, Construction and Education Stalled, Dispatch from Wuchang: Due to recent natural disasters and man-made calamities in Hubei Province, rural areas have gone bankrupt, resulting in a significant impact on the province's treasury revenue. According to investigations, the province's treasury revenue was originally mainly derived from land tax, with an annual quota of approximately 2 million yuan. In the previous two years, the average collection was only 70%, or 1.2 million yuan per year. In the 21st year of the Republic, due to the increasingly depressed rural economy, land tax revenue was reduced to just over 600,000 yuan, which is only 30% of the original quota. According to accurate statistics, the actual monthly revenue in the 21st year of the Republic is listed as follows:</p>
<p>July of the 21st year of the Republic: 20,440 yuan; August: 38,535 yuan; September: 15,203 yuan; October: 124,568 yuan; November: 93,278 yuan; December: 114,675 yuan; January of the 22nd year of the Republic: 20,958 yuan; February: 14,233 yuan; March: 54,168 yuan; April: 32,004 yuan; May: 67,309 yuan; June: 49,354 yuan; Total: 644,725 yuan.</p>
<p>Also, since the implementation of the abolition of likin (internal tariffs) in the province, tax revenue has also decreased. The income and expenditure are far from sufficient, and the province has resorted to borrowing money to make ends meet. According to investigations, in the past year, from April of the 21st year to March of this year, a total of over 6,263,000 yuan has been borrowed from various banks. From June of the 21st year to April of this year (11 months), a total of over 349,000 yuan has been collected from borrowed house rents. The total is over 6,613,500 yuan. The province's treasury's income and expenditure for the past month, totaling over 3 million yuan, is recorded below to show the situation of government expenditure allocation: (A) Income: Land tax 49,354.890, deed tax 20,048.88, brokerage tax 11,022.310, salt tax 600, slaughter tax 8,154.910, business tax 246,040.032, public property income 19,745.170, business income 370.300, regular and surcharge taxes 18,717.240, administrative income 6,458.249, judicial income 24.560, income from securities 11,810.160, miscellaneous income 433.650, budget surplus 11,819.330, public loan income 292,460.630, subsidy 615,039.230, borrowed funds 69,968.120, lump-sum payment 100,000, Hankou city income 1,953,235.540, previous month's inventory 90,667.630, total income 3,532,321.8211 yuan.</p>
<p>(B) Expenditure: Land tax 64,500, repayment of borrowed funds 139,328.750, advances 2,770.000, temporary notes 31,344.910, party affairs expenses 25,557.840, administrative expenses 73,170.127, reserve fund 105,345.800, public security expenses 235,884.660, financial expenses 64,905.654, education and cultural expenses 146,975.780, agriculture and mining 3,647.150, industry and commerce 3,686.880, construction expenses 35,287.390, health expenses 1,726.270, judicial expenses 59,672.090, official business expenses 260,611.240, Hankou expenditure 1,953,235.920, interest 134,894.920, subsidies 630.000, public debt expenditure 86,500.000, surplus 167,082.730, total expenditure 3,532,321.831 yuan.</p>
<p>The surplus for the month is 167,082 yuan, but after deducting the 98,085 yuan for June government expenses, the actual surplus is 68,995 yuan. Also, the separate listing of income and expenditure for Hankou is a transfer account of income and expenditure from October 11th of the 21st year to April 30th of the 22nd year. From the above table, it can be seen that the fiscal revenue of Hubei Province relies heavily on borrowing, while the expenditure on industry, commerce, education, culture, agriculture, mining, and health is very low.

<h3 id="e103">The Yellow River Has Entered a Dangerous Situation <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>| Han Orders County Magistrates Along the River to Move to the Dikes for Defense |</p>
<p>Dispatch from Jinan: The water level of the Yellow River in Shandong Province has been increasing recently, gradually presenting a serious situation. All the people of Shandong are worried about this. The provincial government recently received a telegram from the Shaanxi provincial government stating that the Yellow River had breached its banks in Yongji County, Shanxi Province, and the floodwaters were rushing south, affecting Pingmin County in Shaanxi Province, informing the downstream provinces to take strict precautions to avoid being flooded. Compared with the annual flooding situation of the Yellow River in Shandong Province, the longest continuous rise in water level is three days. This year, the water level has been rising since July 21st, and it has already been seven days (28th). The water level in each section is still rising continuously. Moreover, according to the Yellow River's custom, the water level will inevitably rise sharply around the Beginning of Autumn, which is regarded as the flood season and the most dangerous period for river works. Now, before the arrival of the great flood season, the water level at Zhongluokou today (28th) actually reached 30.05 meters, only 0.05 meters lower than the highest water level last year. Furthermore, according to the speculation of experienced experts, the water level in the upper reaches is still high, and it is unknown whether it will create a new water level record in the future. Under this current situation, the lives and property of millions of people along the river depend on the dikes. Therefore, Provincial Chairman Han Fuju and Director of the River Affairs Bureau Zhang Lianjia are extremely anxious about this, and they have jointly discussed protection measures. Han Fuju also telegraphed today to the magistrates of Licheng, Changqing, Qihhe, Jiyang, Qidong, Qingcheng, Feicheng, Dongping, Pingyin, Juancheng, Huimin, Binzhou, Putai, Lijin, Zhanhua, and Qiu counties, a total of 22 counties along the river, ordering them to move to the dikes for defense for seven days starting from today, in order to jointly supervise the soldiers and laborers to assist in the defense with the river workers, and to report the dates of arrival and departure at work at any time for examination, in order to emphasize the importance of the dikes.</p>
<p>The River Affairs Bureau received a report from Dongzhuang in the upper reaches today that the water level had slightly decreased, but the water level was still at 58.8 meters. At Guanzhuang, it rose 1.2 inches, and the water level was 35.91 meters, which is the highest recorded water level in previous years. At Scorpion Bay in the lower reaches, it rose another 7 centimeters, and the water level was 18.27 meters. The situation of the entire river has entered a dangerous state. In order to prevent any eventuality, it is planned to raise the dikes along the river, which will be three feet higher than last year. Even if the river water rises another foot this year, the dike will still be two feet higher than the water surface. If no other changes occur, the river works can be guaranteed to be safe. In order to understand the water level and plan the dikes, Director Zhang Lianjia went to Luokou this morning at 8 o'clock with Zhao Luren, chief of the General Affairs Section of the River Affairs Bureau, Pan Fen, chief of the Engineering Section, and Wen Chenglie, the mayor of Jinan, to inspect and investigate the construction situation. They returned to Jinan around 11 o'clock at noon. (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Gao Yihan of Songjiang Inspects Songjiang <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Gao Yihan, an inspector of the Control Yuan, arrived in Songjiang today at half past ten by car, accompanied by his secretary Wang. He drove to the commissioner's office, where Commissioner Jin welcomed him and they talked to each other. A banquet was held in the office, inviting Cai Zhongyu of the Chamber of Commerce, Li Jingxian of the Land Production Office, Ni Bingshi of the Storage Association, and Ye Dingchu of the county party department, Shen Jing, the head of the public security bureau, and others to accompany them. After the banquet, a discussion was held, in which Inspector Gao reported that he had come to investigate administration, education, public security, and judicial matters, carrying various survey forms. Secretary Wang was sent to the court and education bureau to fill out the forms separately. Gao paid close attention to the seawall. The attendees stated that the county's seawall had been slightly damaged by the recent hurricane, but it had been repaired. However, it was not a fundamental solution. Repairing the seawall required a huge amount of money, which was beyond the financial capacity of the local government. It was also difficult to obtain funds from the provincial treasury. It was generally agreed that American wheat was used to protect the rural economy. However, if the seawall was not solid, the rural economy could not be developed. As a result, it was proposed that the county should jointly request the allocation of American wheat with Changshu and Baoshan counties to pay for the repair of the seawall. The consensus was that Gao returned to Shanghai by car at 5 p.m. It was said that he had made an appointment to inspect the seawall together at a later date, to facilitate the planning of the project.</p>

<p>Since Captain Zhou of the Salt Police was stationed in Lujiahui, Nanhui, he has indulged his subordinates, and conflicts with the people have occurred repeatedly. Yesterday, a villager brought three catties of salt to Gong Ruixing's clothing store to tailor clothes. It happened to be seen by the salt police, who vented their anger on the sewing worker of the store, causing him to be severely beaten and injured. It was at 1 p.m., just when the villagers were going to the market. Qi Zhaoging, a clerk at the official salt distribution point of Yipinzai, ordered the salt police to fire their guns as a warning, causing panic among the people. Xu Yiqun, a doctor in the town, questioned Zhao Qing for not ordering the salt police to fire their guns, but was attacked by the salt police, who injured the top of his head, causing him to bleed profusely and be detained at the team headquarters. Merchants and people were indignant and went on strike. The head of the ninth district of Hangtou, Shen, learned of the incident and immediately went to Lu to mediate with Police Chief Chen of the Salt Police. Unexpectedly, Police Chief Chen was unreasonable, and the merchants and people felt even more dissatisfied, resulting in a continued strike.</p>

<p>Wang Simo, the chief prosecutor of the Jiangsu Higher Court Procuratorate, has been in office for five or six years, and there have long been rumors of a change of personnel. It was not easy to find a suitable candidate to succeed him. It was not until yesterday (31st) that the Ministry's order arrived in Suzhou, transferring Wang to be the president of the Fengyang First Branch of the Anhui Higher Court. The new position of chief prosecutor of the Suzhou Higher Court Procuratorate left vacant will be provisionally filled by Hu Yi-yu, the current president of the Zhenjiang District Court.

<p>The General Manager Temple in Wang City Town, 8th District, was built during the Kangxi period of the Qing Dynasty. There was an opera house, which was spacious, well-decorated, and luxurious. It has been more than 300 years since then. On the night before last (29th) at around 12 o'clock, it suddenly caught fire. By the time the residents went to rescue it, it had become a raging fire. Moreover, because there were no water pumps in the countryside, it was not easy to extinguish. Within two hours, it was completely burned down. There were 26 coffins stored under the building, which were also completely destroyed. The total loss is estimated to be around 5,000 to 6,000 yuan.</p>

<p>The county government and the business tax bureau of this county have recently received instructions from the Department of Finance that temporary merchants transporting goods are engaged in short-term business and should be collected on a one-time basis according to regulations. Previously, with reference to the Anhui precedent, the method of payment on behalf of the industry was used, and the bureau was ordered to comply. It is now found that the handling of each bureau is not consistent, which is detrimental to tax revenue. A method of collection procedures has been specifically revised and ordered to be followed. The two heads of the county bureau issued a bulletin yesterday after receiving the order, and also sent a letter to the county chamber of commerce, forwarding the letter to various merchants to comply with. Also, the Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce stated that the business tax rate for the 22nd year of the Republic has been repeatedly pleaded for by the chamber of commerce for the merchants, and the provincial department has agreed to continue to handle it according to the current tax rate. Therefore, a letter was specially sent to the county chamber of commerce to assist the tax bureau in collecting taxes, in order to emphasize the importance of the country.</p>

The operator will connect the line, and the other party's phone will ring automatically, which is more convenient than a crank phone. The total number of telephones will be 1,600. If management can be improved at the same time, business can be improved.</p>

<p>During this hot season, epidemics are most likely to spread. The Anhui Provincial Government previously issued a special order to all counties to establish epidemic prevention agencies to prevent the spread of epidemics. After receiving the order, the Public Security Bureau here immediately began preparations. On the afternoon of the 29th, Bureau Chief He Guoliang invited people from all walks of life to hold a meeting at the Sanmin Education Center at 3:00 PM to discuss organizational methods. It was decided to establish the Bengbu Summer Epidemic Prevention Committee, and 43 well-known local figures were appointed as epidemic prevention committee members. Currently, they are working hard to plan the internal organization and epidemic prevention measures. Once the funds are raised, they plan to establish an epidemic prevention isolation hospital and inspection station to prevent the spread of epidemics. Since the beginning of summer, no true epidemic has occurred in this city. In addition, with continuous cloudy and rainy weather, the temperature is cool. According to general speculation, there may not be a widespread epidemic this summer.</p>

<h3 id="e123">New Guidelines for Municipal Facilities in the Future <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Reported at the Municipal Government Memorial Week, Emphasizing Efforts to Cultivate People's Self-Governance Abilities to Gradually Transition from Official Governance to People's Governance - Central News Agency reports: This morning, the Municipal Government held a memorial week, attended by more than 100 officials from various bureaus and offices. Mayor Wu Tiecheng presided over the ceremony. Mayor Wu began by reporting on the new guidelines for future municipal facilities. The following is the speech delivered by Mayor Wu: Esteemed comrades, the most important legacy of the late Premier is construction. The purpose of our revolution is also construction.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Construction Work <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>In addition to people's livelihood construction and economic construction, political construction is especially important. During this period of political tutelage, all comrades in the Party, whether working in administrative agencies or Party headquarters, or serving in various professions locally, should lead the people of the whole country to jointly complete the political construction of the political tutelage period. The foundation of political construction lies in local self-government. Therefore, if local self-government work cannot be completed, the foundation of democracy cannot be consolidated. If the foundation of democracy cannot be consolidated, the purpose of political construction cannot be achieved. Therefore, since the "January 28th Incident" last year, after suffering severe damage, the Municipal Government, despite its extremely strained finances, has strived to prepare</p>
<h3 id="e125">Local Self-Government <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>work according to the original self-government procedures, and has also organized a Provisional Municipal Council. Although the councilors of the Provisional Municipal Council are nominated rather than elected, their powers are the same as those of a formally elected Municipal Council. Therefore, the entire Municipal Government should respect the Provisional Municipal Council as it would respect a democratically elected Municipal Council. This is a necessary stage in the process of preparing for self-government during the period of political tutelage. Our efforts to prepare for self-government work must aim at realizing democracy. We should not be like those who prepared for self-government in the past – district chiefs, local gentry, and headmen – who, after receiving orders from the central government, only put up a sign of preparing for self-government without any actual results. Our country has been in a state of instability for years. The work of preparing for self-government has been interrupted and resumed from time to time due to various changes. Therefore, although local self-government has been prepared for several times, it has not yet succeeded, and the foundation of local self-government has not been established. Therefore, my colleagues in the Municipal Government, based on past experiences, should not only enthusiastically prepare for local self-government, but also reflect on the shortcomings and mistakes of past preparations for local self-government, and use all our energy to</p>
<h3 id="e126">Strive Forward <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The preparation procedures must be very strict and practical, so that our efforts to implement the preparation of local self-government can produce results. This is what we should pay attention to when implementing local self-government. Furthermore, the best place to implement local self-government is in cities, because cities are where talent is more concentrated, transportation facilities are more complete, and it is also an economic center. Therefore, implementing local self-government in cities is easier than in other inland areas, because cities are more equipped with the conditions for self-government. Therefore, comrades who serve in cities should work together to complete the work of local self-government, so that the political tutelage work of local self-government can succeed in cities, and at the same time, it can arouse interest in political construction throughout the country. Therefore, whenever the Municipal Government has the opportunity to allow local people to</p>
<h3 id="e127">Participate in Municipal Affairs <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>we try our best to give it to the local people. For example, the Municipal Bank is a bank run by the Municipal Government, but many directors and supervisors of the Municipal Bank are appointed from local leaders, so that they can participate in all the bank's operations. Also, like the Industrial and Trust Company that we are going to establish recently, we also want to invite local leaders and big businessmen to serve as directors and supervisors. There are also several other things, such as the Municipal Library, the Municipal Museum, and the Municipal Hospital, etc. We also want to invite local people to participate in the preparations. Not only to participate in the preparations, but after the establishment in the future, we will also invite local people to organize a board of directors to manage various undertakings. In short, our new guidelines for municipal facilities in the future are always to give local people more opportunities to participate in municipal affairs, so that municipal affairs can gradually progress from official governance to people's governance. Therefore, various public undertakings in the locality should not only invite local people to participate during the initial establishment or preparation period, but also</p>
<h3 id="e128">Proceed Together <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>but also hand them over to local people for management after they are established, so that these public welfare undertakings related to all citizens of the city will not be affected by political or personnel changes. Therefore, from now on, the Shanghai Municipal Government will follow this policy and direction and work hard to achieve the goal of transitioning from official governance to people's governance and realize the ideal of political construction.</p>

<p>Chinese and Concession Police Agencies Declare Temporary Martial Law Today, August 1st, is the World Anti-Imperialist and Anti-War Movement Day. Every year on this day, workers' groups in countries around the world are expected to hold demonstrations and marches. In order to prevent reactionary elements from taking the opportunity to cause trouble, the Chinese and Concession police agencies in this city have declared a temporary state of martial law.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Temporary Martial Law <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Wen Hong'en, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, ordered all district police stations, supervisory offices, and detective teams yesterday to implement temporary martial law today. All major roads will have double sentries, and supervisors and detectives will be fully deployed. The patrol teams of the Garrison Headquarters will continue to patrol as usual. The security teams under the Municipal Security Office will continue to be stationed in various places to guard the security of various districts. The police stations in the Public Concession and the French Concession have also been ordered to strengthen their defenses and deploy additional Chinese and Western armed detectives to guard the areas of worker schools in eastern and western Shanghai to prevent any incidents.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Gatherings and Meetings Prohibited <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>In addition to being ordered to declare temporary martial law, all Chinese and Concession police agencies have prohibited any gatherings, associations, marches, or demonstrations by workers and students. However, gatherings permitted by the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Committee, after prior notification to the district office in charge, will be provided with police protection; otherwise, they will also be prohibited. Yesterday, reactionary slogans written in chalk were found on the walls of Xujiahui Road, Pudong Yangshupu Road, and western Shanghai's Rue Robert streets in the French Concession. The authorities have paid special attention to strict investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Ministry of Finance Streamlines Salt Tax <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Construction of Salt Mounds in Northern Anhui Expected to Be Completed This Year - Stepped-up Training for Tax Police to Strictly Prevent Smuggling - Since the Seizure of Customs Revenue in Northeast China, the National Treasury's Revenue Has Been Greatly Reduced. In Order to Consolidate National Treasury Revenue, Minister of Finance Song Ziwen Has Begun to Streamline Salt Tax to Make Up for the Loss. He Visited Salt Areas in Northern Anhui by Plane This Spring with Zhu Tingqi, Director of the Salt Affairs Inspection Office, and Planned to Build More Salt Mounds, All of Which Have Been Set in Motion. A Central News Agency Reporter Recently Inquired with the Salt Industry in This City About the Latest Developments in the Ministry of Finance's Streamlining of Salt Affairs, As Follows:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Construction of Salt Mounds <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The four salt fields of Banzhong and Linji in northern Anhui produce a large amount of salt. The scattered salt, which cannot be stored in mounds, amounts to tens of millions of dan each year. It is necessary to build a large number of salt mounds to concentrate the salt and prevent smuggling. Construction has already begun. The completed ones include Sanyanggang Official Mound, Renzhuang Mound, Huangsha Mound, and Xiakou Mound in Linxing Field, and Taiping Commercial Mound in Banpu Field, and Zhongzheng Commercial Mound in Zhongzheng Field. Those expected to be completed this year include Nanbei Mound, Zhizi Mound, Baisitou Mound, Lijiagang Mound, Kuangdongsha Mound, Liangdongsha Mound, Xingzhuang Mound, Wudonghe Mound, and Anjiazhuang Mound in Linxing Field, Houzui Mound and Dapu Commercial Mound in Banpu Field, Dongzoushan Official Mound and Zhang 　 Official Mound in Zhongzheng Field, and Chenjiagang Official Mound, Duigougang Official Mound, and Yanweigang Official Mound in Jinan Field. The cost of building the mounds and dredging the rivers is a total of 1,409,280 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Streamlining Tax Rates <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Domestic salt sales areas have unequal tax rates in various regions. Although there were reasons for the regulations in the past, they were not originally intended to be high or low. However, the disparity is too great, and after a long time, smuggling is inevitable. Minister of Finance Song Ziwen, in view of this, ordered the General Inspectorate to streamline the tax rates in order to equalize the burden and increase tax revenue. After discussion, the General Inspectorate decided to raise the tax rates in all low-tax areas and not to increase the tax rates in high-tax areas for the time being. For adjacent areas, the tax rates will be increased or decreased to ensure balance. The various central and local surcharges, which are confusing and difficult to assess, have also been discussed and consolidated. The field tax and central surcharge paid in the producing area are collectively called the regular tax, and the shore tax and central surcharge paid at the sales area are called the sales tax. The local surcharges are called surcharges (except for the foreign debt surcharge, which is specifically set up to compensate for the pound sterling loss, which will remain the same). A temporary tax rate table for streamlining salt tax has been set up to streamline the process.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Tax Revenue Statistics <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The total tax revenue statistics for the Republic of China in 1932 was 156,921,000 yuan, including 22,126,000 yuan from Changlu, 2,632,000 yuan from Hedong, 469,000 yuan from Koubei, 977,000 yuan from Jinbei, 7,942,000 yuan from Shandong, 12,447,000 yuan from Huaibei, 13,763,000 yuan from Yangzhou, 9,250,000 yuan from Songjiang, 9,862,000 yuan from Liangzhe, 12,777,000 yuan from E'an, 13,549,000 yuan from Xiang'an, 5,203,000 yuan from Wan'an, 7,970,000 yuan from Xi'an, 5,371,000 yuan from Henan, 3,847,000 yuan from Fujian, 10,483,000 yuan from Guangdong, 1,622,000 yuan from Guangxi, 2,043,000 yuan from Yunnan, 2,581,000 yuan from South Sichuan, 1,905,000 yuan from North Sichuan, 337,000 yuan from Gansu, 83,000 yuan from Qinghai, 295,000 yuan from Xinjiang, 387,000 yuan from Ningxia, and 291,000 yuan from Lianyun sales abroad, totaling 157,212,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Training of Tax Police <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The training of tax police is extremely important. In the past, smuggling squads were often understaffed and had bad habits, extorting money and releasing smugglers. Therefore, strict screening was carried out during the reorganization, vacancies were filled, and training was stepped up to create an elite force. Since the establishment of the Tax Police Section and the Water Patrol Unit, the affiliated patrol ships have been reorganized. The original eight patrol ships and two steamers have also been repaired separately, so that land and water joint defense can easily prevent smuggling. The tax police achieved significant results in suppressing smuggling, seizing a total of 64,148 dan and 87 jin of smuggled goods last year.</p>
<h3 id="e137">Ma Zhanshan to Announce Donations Received Today <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>Lang Guanpu Discusses Total Donations Received of Over 1.6 Million - First Donation Transferred from Shanghai Woman Donating Three-Quarters of Family Property, Amounting to 15,000 Yuan - Xin Xin She reports: Since General Ma Zhanshan arrived in Shanghai, he has announced that he has received only 1.4 million yuan in donations, which has caused concern among various sectors. It is said that the total amount of donations is actually over 20 million yuan. In order to understand the truth, a Xin Xin She reporter visited Lang Guanpu, the former Director of Finance of Heilongjiang Province, yesterday to inquire about everything. The details of Lang's discussion are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e138">Total Amount of Donations <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Lang said, "General Ma and his troops have received a total of about 1.7 million yuan in donations, which should be explained in several parts: (1) General Ma personally received a total of 1.38 million yuan in Hailun; (2) Ma Kui, General Ma's son, received 10,000 yuan in donations for the purchase of radios; (3) the Heilongjiang Provincial Government received 91,000 yuan in donations; (4) Chairman She Lin received over 20,000 yuan in donations in Beiping; (5) General Zhu Qinglan of the Northeast Support Association received over 60,000 yuan in donations, which have been used to support General Ma's troops; (6) the Ministry of Finance received over 24,000 yuan in donations, of which 10,000 yuan has been paid; (7) the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission in Nanjing received over 2,400 yuan in donations; (8) the Shen Bao newspaper received over 3,100 US dollars in donations; (9) Duan Zhongwan of the Beiping-Shanghai Support Association received over 12,000 yuan in donations; (10) the Nanjing Finance Committee received over 17,000 yuan in donations (unclaimed). The donations include US dollars, British pounds, Ha dollars, silver dollars, and big dollars, which are converted into about 1.7 million yuan in national currency. As for General Ma's announcement of receiving over 1.4 million yuan a few days ago, the remaining 200,000 yuan was used by the central government and the Northeast Coordination Association and the Support Association to send people to Chahar to慰劳the troops. The donations received on behalf of Ma were unknown to him beforehand. This should be solemnly stated to avoid misunderstandings."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Printing Credit Record <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>When General Ma was stationed in Hailun, he specially appointed Zhang Qinglu as the donation collection commissioner in Harbin. All donations remitted from various places were divided into three copies, all with Ma Zhanshan's signature and seal. One copy was kept by the remitting bank, one copy was given to the remitting person, and one copy was kept by Ma's office. The amount of all donations received was printed in a credit record in Hailun, and all income and expenditure items were clearly listed. All troops directly under Ma's command were distributed with it. Unfortunately, when he left the province in a hurry, all the credit records and receipts were not taken out. What he relies on now is what is recorded in the donation collection book of Zhang Qinglu, the donation collection commissioner. In case the book is lost, the remitting bank can also be consulted. Among the donations, the Bank of China remitted the most.</p>
<h3 id="e140">Ma's Public Announcement <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Accountant Pan Xulun sent a telegram to Ma requesting him to announce the donations received before and after, but Ma did not receive the telegram. Later, after seeing it published in Shanghai newspapers, he immediately telegraphed himself to announce it as soon as possible. Now various income and expenditure reports have been completed, but there is still one item whose amount is uncertain, and he has telegraphed the handler in Beiping to inquire. After receiving the reply today (yesterday), it will be announced tomorrow or the day after tomorrow (today).</p>
<h3 id="e141">Sending Personnel to Receive Funds <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Finance Committee in Beiping received over 17,000 yuan in donations on behalf of the Committee, and sent a letter to inform it a few days ago. After telegraphing General Ma to inquire, it sent personnel to Beiping yesterday to receive the funds. If it is too late due to time, it will be kept for the second report.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Enthusiastic Woman <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Lang also told the Xin Xin She reporter that when</p>
<p>After Ma Zhanshan issued his anti-Japanese telegram in the Northeast, the first donation was from an anonymous person in Shanghai, totaling 15,000 yuan. It was remitted through the Bank of China. When General Ma arrived in Shanghai, he inquired everywhere and learned that the anonymous person was a pseudonym of a certain lady. The lady was from Shanghai, but unfortunately, the lady's name has been forgotten. Her family property was only over 20,000 yuan. When donating, the Bank of China staff asked her name, but she refused to say it. The bank said it did not comply with the remittance procedures, so she said her name. General Ma personally visited her in Shanghai and intended to give her a text to express his admiration, but she did not allow it. Ma is still thinking about it in his heart.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Feng Yuxiang Denies Abandoning Dolon <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Also Denies Sending Representatives to Contact the Japanese Authorities - Yesterday, a certain party in this city received a telegram from Feng Yuxiang from Zhangjiakou, officially denying the rumors reported by the Japanese telegram that Chahar sent representatives to contact the Japanese military authorities in Pingjin, and the rumors reported by the Ping telegram that Dolon had been captured by the Japanese puppet forces. He also said that Dolon is still firmly defended by our army.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Chen Gongbo Visited Mayor Wu Yesterday - Chen Discussed: <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Factory Inspection to Be Handled by the Municipal Government - Deliberations on the American Cotton and Wheat Loan - Decision on the Special Bureau for Trade with Russia to Be Made After Song Returns - Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo visited Mayor Wu at the Municipal Government yesterday morning after arriving in Shanghai the day before yesterday. A Central News Agency reporter inquired about the inspection of factories in Shanghai when</p>
<p>The Minister Departed and Gave the Following Reply:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Factory Inspection <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yu, Secretary-General of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and Feixin, President of the Shanghai Municipal Council, have negotiated on the factory inspection issue several times. Although there are now some prospects, rumors that the signing date has been set and that an inspection office will be established are unfounded. Although factory inspection is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry, this Shanghai Concession factory inspection issue is a local event, so the Shanghai Municipal Government is responsible for the negotiation. The Ministry of Industry will only provide instructions from time to time. Therefore, the signing of the contract and the establishment of the inspection office, etc., depend on the negotiations of the Shanghai Municipal Government. It is not possible to say to what extent a decision can be made.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Cotton and Wheat Loan <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>After the American Cotton and Wheat Loan of 50 million was established through negotiations between Minister of Finance Song and the American authorities, it will be shipped to China in batches, but it has not yet arrived. The central government is deliberating on the distribution issue. The American Cotton and Wheat Loan Affairs Office of the Central Bank has been established. After the American cotton and wheat arrive, the Ministry of Industry will send personnel to participate. Because the distribution of American cotton and wheat is a major issue, the Ministry of Industry has the responsibility to offer opinions at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Trade with Russia <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The steel plant planned to be established by the Ministry of Industry will be established in about September. The collection of fishery construction fees has caused disputes in the past due to misunderstandings by merchants and people. Now, after mediation by all parties, a satisfactory solution has been reached. Because Russian goods are often dumped, they are gradually gaining ground in the Chinese market. As for whether our country will establish a special bureau for trade with Russia in the future, or whether it will still be handled by merchants, this matter must be decided after Minister Song returns to the country. Because this matter is closely related to tariffs.</p>

<p>The first aviation highway construction lottery issued by the National Government, totaling 500,000 numbers, has been enthusiastically purchased by all sectors since its launch, which is unprecedented. This is because the profits from this lottery are used for national construction, and the chances of winning a prize are higher than other lotteries. Yesterday was the date of the first lottery draw, which was held at the Yiyuan in the French Concession on Albert Road at 1:00 PM. About 10,000 representatives from all parties and Chinese and foreign citizens went to visit. At the same time, there were three airplanes flying in the sky above the 　 .

<p>The lottery venue was set up in front of the grandstand on the front side of the dog racing track in the garden. The layout of the venue was very simple. A bamboo shed was set up under the grandstand, with three copper balls, A, B, and C, inside. Ball B was the largest and set in the center. A and B were smaller and set on the left and right sides as recording tables 　 . The middle was the prize draw and announcement area, with two phonographs. The grandstand opposite was for the seats of the supervisory committee members and representatives from all sectors, Chinese and foreign reporters, etc. The rest were for the audience seats for Chinese and foreign citizens.

<p>Before the drawing, Chairman Song Ziwen first delivered a speech on behalf of Zhang Yong, roughly stating: "Today is the day for the first issuance of aviation and highway construction lottery tickets by the National Government, and we are very pleased to see such good results. If the people are all enthusiastic about the government's aviation and highway construction, then the hope of success is promising. At the same time, we can also see the greatness of the spirit of cooperation between the people and the government. Therefore, we firmly believe that the issuance of the second and third lottery tickets in the future will surely achieve even better results. Today, I represent the government to thank you all and also thank the enthusiasm of the people involved in this event. There is still one point that must be clarified to you. The lottery tickets issued by the government this time are completely impartial and open. The numbers for today's drawing have been inspected by representatives from all walks of life. Currently, because a small portion of the lottery tickets has not been sold, for the sake of protecting the rights of lottery buyers, it has been decided to redraw the top prize if it is drawn from the unsold numbers. It must be drawn from the sold lottery ticket numbers. Now that the time has arrived, the drawing will begin on time." (Translated into English by Dong Guoen)</p>
<h3 id="e155">Details of the Drawing <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The chairman personally attended the scene to supervise. First, the small balls and ball plate of Machine B were opened for inspection one by one. Then, they were poured into Machine B in three separate batches. Subsequently, Machines C and A were also poured in successively. Then, the three machines were shaken simultaneously, shaken a total of three times. Then, the spring doors were opened, and the numbers jumped out. The announcer called out the numbers and grades, and then the recorder registered them. At the same time, the numbers were posted and announced. This was done in rotation until 8:30 PM. The announcers and number runners all wore white spun silk long gowns, and both hands were covered with white hard half-sleeve gloves. When picking up the numbers, they raised their hands high to show that there was no selfishness or fraud.</p>

<p>Just as the chairman began to deliver his speech, three airplanes, including Generalissimo Chiang's Sikorsky aircraft and Eurasia Aviation's aircraft, soared over the venue to express their congratulations. They scattered a lot of five-colored paper streamers, slogans, and flowers. They flew away at 1:40 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Difficult Birth of the First Prize <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>After the drawing began, all eyes were on the 500,000 yuan first prize. When the 19th draw was made, the winning number was [226622]. For a moment, everyone cheered and celebrated, which was very lively. Later, the staff of the office found that the number was in the unsold numbers. In order to encourage the people to actively participate in the national construction movement and to demonstrate credibility, the government decided to give up the first prize and treat it as a special prize and redraw it, to be drawn from the sold lottery ticket numbers. After all the numbers were drawn, Huang Guoen, Secretary-General of the Aviation Lottery Office, reported that the re-drawing would use Balls B and C. The number [314034] was drawn, and it was found that this number was also in the unsold lottery tickets. Then it was redrawn again, and the resulting number was [299287], which was awarded as a special prize. It was found that the ticket was sold by the Da Yun Company through the Shanghai Bank, winning the prize money of 500,000 yuan. However, lottery tickets with the last two digits matching one digit of the first prize number [226622] are still based on the first drawing for the lottery results. (Photo by Xu Tianzhang)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the reporter met with Director Zheng Lai and Secretary Huang Guoen at the venue. According to them, in order to demonstrate credibility, the government now gives up the first prize of 500,000 yuan and re-draws it from the sold lottery ticket numbers as a special prize. As for the prize money, it will be fully exchanged by the Central China Communications Bank from August 7th. However, the second phase of issuance will divide each ticket into ten strips, with each strip sold for one yuan, and each ticket for ten yuan. The issuance date is expected to be after August 7th.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Shanghai Machinery Manufacturers Joint Association Sends Another Letter to the Ratepayers Association Regarding the Municipal Council's Warning to Factories <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Council should be fully responsible for the damage to the factories caused by the erroneous investigation. Xin Sheng News Agency reports that regarding the Municipal Council's warning to various factories, the Shanghai Machinery Manufacturers Joint Association (機聯會) yesterday sent another letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Shanghai International Settlement, requesting assistance. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e162">Letter to the Ratepayers Association <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Machinery Manufacturers Joint Association wrote to the Ratepayers Association yesterday, stating: "Regarding the fact that the concession authorities unilaterally amended Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations, authorizing the Municipal Council to do so, and the Municipal Council used Article 30, which has been in place for a long time, as an excuse to inspect factories, regardless of the background or whether it is a seizure of power, we will put it aside for now. The Association believes that Chinese factories are simple and crude, and their safety equipment must be immature. However, within its sphere of influence, the Municipal Council uses the guise of preventing public danger. The conclusion of our Association's July 15th declaration even indicated that we would assist the Municipal Council in avoiding criticism and instruct factories. The so-called gentleman can be deceived by his way. Moreover, the Municipal Council sends Westerners to investigate factories. If our factory's contents are complete, there should be a Western-speaking staff member to deal with them. Otherwise, if the Municipal Council relies solely on the Western investigator's own ideals for speculation and then warns the factory to stop, is it inappropriate? This is very questionable. Judging from the warning received by the Yisheng Rubber Factory this time, two errors were found, which made us even more suspicious. The errors are briefly described below: (1) The rubber factory's refining and grinding are essentially one type of work, but after the investigator's investigation, the Municipal Council's warning letter actually divided them into two. (2) The rubber factory's shoe-hanging cart and freight cart are completely different. According to the shoe-hanging cart, the pushing cannot be forceful, because if you use force, the luster of the overshoes will be lost. However, after the investigator's investigation, the Municipal Council's warning letter stated that methods should be found to avoid the use of hard tools on iron products. The iron freight cars traveling on iron rails should not have wheels with iron or hard edges. Therefore, we issued Notice No. 504 to our members yesterday. If you receive an English letter from the Municipal Council, you should return it immediately and ask them to translate it into Chinese, and send it together with the original English letter, so as to avoid one mistake leading to another. However, the Municipal Council does not hire specialized personnel to conduct investigations, and the matter is not taken seriously. If the factory suffers significant losses due to an erroneous investigation, the Municipal Council should be fully responsible for compensating the losses. We are concerned that your Association, as the highest body representing more than 55% of the tax revenue and more than 95% of the population in the International Settlement, hereby inform you specially, respectfully requesting you to investigate and make a strong statement to avoid errors and disputes."</p>
<h3 id="e163">Hoping to Avoid Errors <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Cheng Shouzhong, Secretary-General of the Machinery Manufacturers Joint Association, told the Xin Sheng News Agency reporter: "Our Association is assisting the Municipal Council to guide factories and improve their contents to avoid public danger, so that the lives and property of citizens can be guaranteed safety. We are willing to run between the Municipal Council and the factories under the scorching sun to seek simple and direct improvement methods and avoid major setbacks and losses due to shutdowns and factory relocations. The Municipal Council's meticulousness in handling affairs has long been recognized by the citizens, not just by our Association. However, due to assisting Yisheng Factory to improve its interior, after many days of research with its manager and factory director, it was found that there were two errors in the Municipal Council's warning to Yisheng Rubber Factory. Therefore, I, together with the manager and factory director of Yisheng Factory, went to the Municipal Council on the 29th of the month. In addition to bringing two official letters replying to the Municipal Council's warning from Yisheng First Factory and Yisheng Second Factory, and stating the points of improvement, we also told Mr. He Dejun, the joint officer, that in addition to the two errors, we have sent a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association to file a protest, and asked him to convey these errors to the person in charge of the Municipal Council. He accepted our request. Our Association has now sent a letter to the Ratepayers Association, requesting them to make a strong statement to avoid errors."</p>
<h3 id="e164">The 12th Group of Displaced Refugees from Mexico Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Zhu Zigao and six others will arrive soon. The refugees who have been obstructed are in urgent need of relief to return to their country. Xin Xin News Agency reports that the 12th group of displaced refugees who were expelled from Mexico arrived in Shanghai at 8:30 AM yesterday, aboard the President Monroe of the Da Lai Company. The Global Overseas Chinese General Association and the Mexican Refugee Relief Association sent representatives Fang Difei, Huang Zhulin, Chen Hanbin, Lin Wenqi, and more than ten others to the Da Lai Wharf in Baizijing, Pudong, to greet them. They rested at the meeting hall on Guizhou Road. This time, only six people, including Zhu Zigao, Liu Guang, Zhu Yiji, Xie Lian (from Taishan), Situ Shu, and Hu Huang (from Kaiping), arrived in Shanghai due to insufficient berths on the President Monroe. According to Zhu Zigao's statement to the Xin Xin News Agency reporter, Mexico refused to subsidize the refugees' travel expenses to return to China, and the U.S. government stopped providing supplies to avoid huge losses and ordered to prohibit refugees from smuggling into the U.S. After that, more than 10,000 refugees remaining in Mexico are unable to return to their country due to lack of travel expenses and are subject to humiliation by the anti-Chinese party. Their inner pain can be imagined. They urgently hope that the government will take measures to provide relief as soon as possible to avoid being stranded in foreign countries. As for the rest who were able to return to China this time, it was because they were detained in the U.S. before the ban. There are still ten people in the U.S. waiting for the ship, and they will be able to return to China one after another soon. It is also heard that Zhu Zigao and the other six are scheduled to take the original ship to Hong Kong this morning to return to their ancestral home in Guangdong. The Overseas Chinese General Association will provide temporary relief funds of ten yuan per person as usual.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Liu Xingji, Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department, Resigns and Comes to Shanghai <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Fang Jiaobo and others send telegrams to persuade him to stay. Liu Xingji, Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department of the Ministry of Industry, studied fisheries overseas for many years and obtained a Ph.D. in aquatic products. Since taking office as director, he has been working hard to reorganize the domestic fisheries, which have been declining year by year. Recently, due to a certain stimulus, he suddenly left a letter of resignation a few days ago and went from Beijing to Shanghai, intending to go to Qingdao. Minister Chen Gongbo had been a classmate of the director in his youth and a comrade in the revolution for a long time, and he was very helpful in the ministry. Upon receiving the letter of resignation, he rushed to Shanghai last night to personally comfort him and persuade him to stay. The fishing industry in Shanghai also sent telegrams to persuade him to stay. However, since Director Liu's attitude was firm, the fishing industry sent telegrams to the Ministry, asking them to persuade him to stay. The telegrams are recorded as follows: (1) Telegram from Fang Jiaobo and others (omitted above): "We were shocked to hear that Director Liu Xingji of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department has resigned. Jiaobo and others believe that Director Liu is talented and promising, with both learning and conduct, and he is resourceful in improving the fishing industry. It seems that it is not appropriate to change the person in charge of the department suddenly. We dare to send a telegram to request that he be reinstated as soon as possible, and we will be grateful." (omitted below) (2) Telegram from Wu Zhenqing, Xu Yifei, and others: "We were shocked to hear that Director Liu Xingji of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department has resigned. We believe that Director Liu, under your leadership, is trying to build up the declining fishing industry and has been praised by everyone for his measures. Zhenqing and others have long hoped to leave behind the shade of the locust tree, so that the person in charge of the fishing industry can be obtained and the reorganization can be hoped for. Zhenqing and others believe that the fishery administration is important and concerned. We dare to express our feelings of sincerity and earnestly request that you do not approve his resignation in order to benefit the fishing industry. We are waiting for your orders in fear." (omitted below) (3) Telegram from Yuanli Fishing Bank, Fang Guoliang, Gongda Fishing Bank, Fan Seng, and others: "We have heard that Liu Xingji, Director of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department, has suddenly resigned. Liang and others believe that the fishing industry has been declining in recent years, and we rely on Director Liu to follow your intentions and work hard to improve it and revive its decline. The people in the fishing industry have praised him in unison. We dare to send a telegram to ask you to persuade him to stay and to allow him to return to his position as soon as possible to comfort the fishing industry. We are deeply grateful." (omitted below) (4) Telegram from Yan Baokun of the Zhenhai Zhunlai Fishing Industry Association: "We have heard from Shanghai that Director Liu Xingji of the Fisheries and Animal Husbandry Department has resigned, which is very doubtful. Director Liu's plan to reorganize the fishing industry is beneficial to the country and the fishermen, and it is worthy of praise. The fishermen all admire him deeply. If the news is not false, we hope that you will not approve his resignation in order to comfort the hopes of the fishing industry. We dare to send a telegram to persuade him to stay. We are waiting for your orders in fear." (omitted below) There are also many express mail telegrams from fishermen in Huang Longsiqiao and other places, as well as the Shanghai River Seafood Industry Union Association, etc., but they are omitted for brevity.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Shanghai Telephone Bureau Revises Public Telephone Prices <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau sent a letter to the Municipal Public Works Bureau, stating: "In order to facilitate public calls, our bureau has approved various businesses inside and outside the city to install public telephones at appropriate locations. The applicants are responsible for their own management, and all installation fees, deposits, and long-distance Chinese and foreign registration fees are waived. It has been found that there are more than 50 public telephones that have been installed. According to the cost calculation of common telephone equipment and line materials, each call requires 3.5 cents. Currently, the fee for each local call is 3 cents, which seems to be a loss based on the cost calculation. Since the use of automatic machines, the capital investment has increased significantly, and the cost of each call should be slightly increased to compensate. All public telephone prices should be revised accordingly. The Ministry of Communications' Directive No. 9152 has been approved and will be implemented from August 1st. All local calls between Nanshi, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Longhua, Pudong, the concession, and Zhenru and Wusong, as well as local calls between public telephones in the Nanshi, Zhabei, Jiangwan, Longhua, and other districts, and calls between public telephones in this district and other districts, will be changed to 5 cents per call."</p>

<p>Demanding the protection of the work of former Electrical Department employees and the improvement of treatment. Seven requests were made to negotiate with the company. The workers of the Shanghai Power Company demanded the reinstatement of the work of union director Ni Wenfu and others, as well as four treatment conditions, but the results were not obtained. A few days ago, the entire group petitioned the Municipal Party Department. At the same time, the employees of the company also made the same request. Yesterday, they jointly petitioned the Municipal Council with worker representatives, requesting assistance, and submitted a proposal to protect the employees of the former Electrical Department and a proposal to improve treatment, requesting that they be forwarded to the company for negotiation. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e168">Joint Petition <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Power Company Employees' Mutual Benefit Association (i.e., the one organized by employees) sent representatives Wu Zupei and Cao Xingbei, together with worker representatives Ni Wenfu, Pan Genlin, Chen Baogen, and Zhang Caisheng, to the Municipal Council General Office on Jiangxi Road at 10:30 AM yesterday, carrying letters of petition. They were met by Joint Officer He Dejun, who first listened to the representatives state their intention to request assistance. He responded that their letter had been fully explained to General Officer Zhong Si, but the Municipal Council needed to consider the case in detail, so he could not reply today, but he hoped to have another opportunity to talk in a short period of time to achieve a satisfactory solution. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Letter to the Municipal Council <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The original letter from the Shanghai Power Company Employees' Appeal Association to the Municipal Council stated: "We, the undersigned, have served in your Electrical Department for many years. After being taken over by the Shanghai Power Company in 1929, our positions were guaranteed by Mr. O'Shea, the manager of your Electrical Department, and we continued to serve in the Power Company. He also guaranteed that our positions would be as secure as if they were under the name of the Municipal Council. However, recently, the Power Company has continued to lay off employees of the former Electrical Department, causing us great panic. On June 21st, we sent a letter to Mr. Sheard, the general manager of the Power Company, asking him to pay attention, but we have not received a reply so far. We have repeatedly requested the company to improve our treatment due to the needs of the current environment, but we have been repeatedly rejected, and even four of the directors of our legally organized trade union have been suspended. Therefore, the masses are indignant and resentful. Therefore, after the decision of the general meeting of all employee representatives, we respectfully request that your bureau, based on the friendship between the former host and guests, forward the attached proposals for protecting the employees of the former Electrical Department and improving treatment to the Power Company as soon as possible, and earnestly guarantee our status and future as if they were under the name of the Municipal Council. We believe that your bureau will have sympathy and assistance for the personnel of the former Electrical Department who have contributed to it. We have sent representatives to visit and hope to be granted an audience and to be instructed in everything. We salute you, Zhong, the General Officer of the Municipal Council of the International Settlement."</p>

<p>"We respectfully inform you that we sent you a letter on June 22nd regarding the company's unreasonable layoffs, but we have not received a reply. As for the workers' request to improve treatment, we have repeatedly requested it, but the company has turned a deaf ear to it. Therefore, the masses are indignant. Therefore, after the decision of the general meeting of employee representatives, we respectfully request that you accept and implement the proposals for protecting the employees transferred from the former Electrical Department and improving treatment. We will be very fortunate. We salute you, Mr. Huo, President of the Power Company, and Mr. Sheard, General Manager of the Power Company. Attached are proposals for protecting employees and improving treatment. The Shanghai Power Company Employees' Appeal Association."</p>
<h3 id="e171">Seven Conditions <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>The employees and workers of the company jointly proposed a total of seven items for improving treatment. The original text is as follows: (1) All employees who have served in the company for more than one year shall be given a year-end bonus of one month's salary at the end of each year. (Note) The China Merchants Electrical Company's year-end bonus is two months, and 50% of the surplus is used as a bonus. (2) All employees who have served in the company for more than one year shall receive three months' severance pay and 5% of the accumulated labor fund when they are laid off by the company, regardless of whether they are dismissed for cause or without cause. (Except for those who have been convicted of criminal acts related to the company by a court) They should also receive 5% of the accumulated labor fund. (Note) The British American Tobacco Company gives 5% to those who resign voluntarily and 10% to those who are laid off by the company. If there is a criminal act, the money is still paid even if they have been prosecuted. (3) All employees who have served in the company for more than one year shall be entitled to two weeks of annual leave (limited to employees). (Note) The current Chinese staff of the Municipal Council has three weeks of annual leave each year, and the senior Chinese staff of the Power Company also have two weeks of annual leave each year. (4) All employees who have served in the company for more than one year and are ordered to retire due to illness by a doctor shall be given 5% of the accumulated labor fund and an additional 5% of the sick retirement fund. (5) When an employee who has served in the company for more than one year dies, he/she shall receive 5% of the accumulated labor fund, 5% of the pension, and 60 yuan for funeral expenses. Those who die on duty shall be given a special pension of 2,000 yuan. Those who are disabled on duty shall be paid their original salary until the date of their death. (Note) The British American Tobacco Company gives a special pension of 1,500 yuan to those who die on duty. (6) If a worker is sick, his/her medical expenses shall be borne by the company in addition to the salary being paid as usual. (Note) The British American Tobacco Company pays the salary as usual when a worker is sick, and the medical expenses are borne by the company. Currently, the salary of a worker who is sick at the Power Company is reduced by half. If they are hospitalized, the medical expenses are borne by the worker himself. For example, if the worker's salary is 60 cents a day, the company only pays half, 30 cents. How will the worker pay for medical expenses? If the doctor tells the worker to be hospitalized and he/she does not comply, the salary will not be paid at all. (7) Increase the salary increase rate set in 1930. (Note) In 1930, the company had been in operation for less than a year, and the original salary increase rate of the Municipal Council was reduced, and there were grades and other restrictions. For example, the monthly salary of a newly hired employee is 27.5 yuan. After one year of service, one yuan is added, up to 37.5 yuan as one level. If he/she does not receive special praise up to 37.5 yuan, the salary increase will stop. New workers receive 68 cents per day, with an annual increase of one cent, up to 80 cents. If they do not get promoted, it will stop forever. This salary increase method is not in line with the evolution of modern life. (Additional rules) 1. Subsidize the monthly fee for the employees' club. 2. Reinstate the four union directors who were dismissed. 3. Establish a school for employees' children. 4. Reorganize the medical office. There must be resident doctors on Fielun Road and Yangshupu Road. It is forbidden to use waste paper and newspaper to wrap medicines to value human life.</p>

Matters for discussion: (1) Proposal for the second step of the method to request exemption from business tax (resolution): Organize a petition delegation to go to Beijing to petition, and nominate Zhao Zixin from Wuxi, Chen Junyu from Wuxian, Gu Xinyi from Shanghai, Lu Gongquan from Changshu, Qin Sheng from Wujiang, Zhang Youchuan from Nantong, and Li Nianzu from Nanjing as the petition delegation. (2) The Changxi Rice Industry Association proposed that the new business tax collection method issued by the Finance Department is similar to disguised likin. The proposal should be discussed (resolution): Send a letter to the Provincial Chamber of Commerce and the National Chamber of Commerce to request a unified effort to fight for it. (3) The Luxu Rice Industry Association proposed that rice shops only pay a food shop license fee. Now, according to the provincial tooth tax regulations, food businesses must obtain separate licenses, which is a bit too harsh. The proposal should be discussed for relief (resolution): Send a letter to the Provincial Chamber of Commerce to request that the tooth tax contractors be stopped from creating new names and harassing. (4) The Wuxi Rice Industry Association proposed to forward the proposal to the government to collect import tax on foreign rice to maintain domestic food (resolution): The proposal has been telegraphed to the Executive Yuan before and has not been approved. A formal request should be submitted for instructions. (5) Committee member Zhu Zixiang proposed a temporary proposal that the association's membership fee was reduced once before, but all members believe that it needs to be further reduced. The proposal should be voted on (resolution): Starting from this year, the membership fee will be reduced to three levels: 100 yuan per year for level A, 60 yuan for level B, and 30 yuan for level C. All county associations that have not joined will be notified to seek a unified membership.</p>
<h3 id="e176">How Can the Shanghai Municipal Council's Tax Collectors Abuse and Insult Taxpayers? <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>丨The Chinese Taxpayers' Association Sends a Letter Requesting the Shanghai Municipal Council to Rectify the Situation.丨 Yesterday, regarding the abuse and insults of taxpayers by the Shanghai Municipal Council's tax collectors, the Chinese Taxpayers' Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Council, stating: Respectfully, according to a letter from taxpayer Xu Jizhuang, a Western tax collector and a Chinese tax collector were dispatched by the Shanghai Municipal Council at 11:00 AM today (the 28th) to collect taxes at Jiaheli, Hart Road. However, the taxpayer had not received prior notification from the Shanghai Municipal Council. Furthermore, as the taxpayer is a member of the military, his salary is paid out at the beginning of each month. However, the Western tax collector pressed him urgently, added insults, and said he would come to collect the tax the next morning. The taxpayer stated that tomorrow would be the same as today, and requested to pay the tax on August 10th. However, in addition to the insults, the Western tax collector also struck the taxpayer's face with his fists, and stated that he would come to collect the tax the next morning. The taxpayer stated that the matter concerns being insulted and disturbed, and if this continues, the residents will be humiliated beyond what is bearable. The taxpayer truthfully reported this and requested your council to handle it impartially, and to inform the Shanghai Municipal Council to avoid the above situation from happening again in the future, and to provide formal prior notice when collecting taxes. Based on this, the collection of municipal general taxes is divided into four seasons each year, with each season lasting three months. At the beginning of each season, the collection should be handled in the same way as Western-style residences to avoid disputes arising from discriminatory treatment. Later, in order to save money, your council pre-published tax payment notices in various newspapers. Although tax payment notices were not issued in advance, it was indeed equally effective. However, this has not been followed for long, and is no longer being done. Since the municipal general tax is collected every three months, the period from the first day of the first month to the end of the third month is the time for paying taxes. Now, if what taxpayer Xu Jizhuang said is true, he did not refuse to pay the tax, nor did he fail to pay it on time, and only requested to pay it on August 10th, which is a normal request. However, the tax collector abused his position and acted recklessly and insultingly, which is extremely inappropriate. Based on the above, we are writing to request that you investigate and instruct the tax collection office to rectify the situation. This is addressed to the General Manager of the Shanghai Municipal Council for the Shanghai International Settlement.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Customs to Formulate Measures for Inspecting Foreigners' Entry Passports <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the punishment of foreign ships, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs should first conduct thorough consultations with relevant countries before it can be implemented without obstruction. Regarding the issue of amending the inspection of foreigners' entry passports, the Inspector General of Customs, after receiving the order from the Customs Administration, immediately drafted measures to assist in the implementation and submitted them to the authorities for approval. The original report is recorded below: The Customs should do its best to inspect foreigners' entry passports to ensure that the measures are effectively implemented. However, after carefully examining the points of amendment discussed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, there seem to be difficulties in implementation because</p>
<h3 id="e178">Extraterritoriality <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>has not yet been abolished. For cases of violations by foreigners enjoying extraterritoriality and foreign shipping companies, the Customs, based on treaty provisions and the severity of the circumstances, handles them separately on the grounds of protecting tax revenue. Foreign merchants also pay the fines in full without any objection because the treaty stipulates different penalties for smuggling, including confiscation of cargo ships. However, if the punishment is not related to tax revenue, it will</p>
<h3 id="e179">Invoke the Treaty <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>as there are no relevant provisions. The consul of that country will file a protest, leading to negotiations. Therefore, regarding the punishment of foreign ships, I believe that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must first conduct thorough consultations with relevant countries, and only after obtaining their consent can it be implemented without obstruction. As for the provision that foreigners coming to China without a passport should be ordered to be carried back by the shipping company, it is also quite difficult to implement before the countries concerned have agreed. However, in practice, there seems to be no need for such a provision because</p>
<h3 id="e180">Foreigners Entering <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>without a passport, or with a passport that has not been certified by our embassy, and without a legitimate reason, our country cannot allow them to disembark. Since they are not allowed to disembark, the shipping company will have to carry them elsewhere. There is no need to specify that the shipping company should be responsible for carrying them back. According to international practice, when shipping companies sell tickets, they first require passengers to sign a statement certifying that their passports and other documents are complete before they can sell them, so as to avoid losses for the company. Therefore,</p>
<h3 id="e181">Our Authorities <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>only need to notify the foreign shipping companies to submit passenger lists to the Customs when the ships arrive at the port, according to the procedure for submitting passenger lists to the Customs, and stipulate that passengers are not allowed to embark or disembark without special permission from our country before their passports have been verified. Then, passengers can wait for verification in order and will not try to avoid it and disembark privately. If the company approves and passengers disembark privately, it can be discussed with the countries concerned to impose</p>
<h3 id="e182">Appropriate Punishment. <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>As for the method of ordering shipping companies to submit passenger lists, it has already been implemented in Shanghai. It is expected that there will be no difficulty in promoting it to other ports. If there are those who refuse to submit them, the Customs can order them to submit an extra copy in addition to the one submitted to the Customs, which will be forwarded by the Customs for record. All the difficulties in implementing the methods discussed by the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to assist in punishing foreign merchant shipping companies for violations have been clarified.</p>

<p>The 11-story building built by the bank will be moved into today for business. The existing location of the Kuo Hua Commercial Bank on Ningbo Road is no longer sufficient for business development. Therefore, the bank purchased a site at the corner of Beijing Road and Henan Road and built an 11-story building. After more than a year of construction, it was completed a few days ago. The bank will officially move into the new building for business today, which has attracted the attention of people in society. The bank authorities specially led guests to visit the new building yesterday. The results of the investigation are described as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e187">Brief History <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The bank was founded by Zou Minchu, Tang Shoumin, and others. The head office is located in Shanghai and officially opened in July of the 17th year of the Republic of China, less than six years ago. The initial authorized capital was 2 million yuan, with half of it actually paid up. Later, as the business developed, the authorized capital increased to 4 million yuan, and the amount actually received has recently approached 3 million yuan, and is still being raised. In the past five years, branches have been established in Suzhou, Nanjing, Guangzhou, and Hongkou, Nanshi, and Xinzha in Shanghai. Offices have also been established in Xumen, Suzhou, Chengbei, Nanjing, and Hong Kong and Xiamen. Recently, a branch will be added in Baxianqiao in Shanghai, which will be opened within one or two months. It is heard that the bank has many contacts in Southeast Asia, and in the near future, it plans to gradually set up branches in important ports there.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Business Overview <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The bank's current business is broadly divided into deposits, loans, remittances, savings, and trusts. Among them, savings and trusts are allocated separate funds and special departments are set up to handle them. Accounting and business are first divided independently, and the savings accounts are reported and published. The trust business includes the safekeeping of warehouses, real estate, and securities, which is quite developed. The amount of remittances made by the bank over the years is quite large, with a total of about 90 million yuan last year, with remittances to South China being the largest. The deposit business has also made progress. According to its first-quarter financial report this year, the total amount is close to 20 million yuan, an increase of almost five times compared with the bank's financial report in the 17th year of the Republic of China. It is not easy to achieve this in less than six years.</p>
<h3 id="e189">New Building Facilities <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>The bank's new building is located at the corner of Beijing Road and Henan Road, covering an area of nearly two acres and 11 stories high. The facade adopts the latest vertical line style, and the high tower on the front face pierces into the clouds, which is especially magnificent. The third floor and above are rented out as office space. The bank's own part, in addition to the land trial, occupies the ground floor, the mezzanine, and the second floor, a total of three floors. The ground floor is the business room, with counters on both sides and a passage in the middle. The communication office, deposit, remittance, branch receipt, and exchange of payments are located on the right, and the foreign exchange and savings departments are located on the left. At the end of the passage is a large escalator leading to the mezzanine, where the trust department and the vault are located. The vault and the book and evidence vault are located in the basement under the ground floor, and the layout is extremely well connected. The ground floor and the mezzanine are the location of the business department, so the decoration is as gorgeous as possible. The ground floor, walls, pillars, escalators, and counters are all paved with the finest Italian marble, which is dazzling. The flower glass ceiling on the roof is also very beautiful. The vault equipment on the mezzanine is sturdy, and the vault walls are all made of 18-inch thick steel and concrete, and the inner walls are all covered with steel plates. The vault door is made of 16-inch thick steel and is equipped with clock locks, secret switches, etc., which cannot be opened unless at a certain time. Thousands of safe deposit boxes are installed in the vault, all sizes are available, and the keys on the boxes are said to be the latest style, which is rare in Shanghai. All other facilities are very well-equipped to ensure the convenience and comfort of customers. The bank authorities have carefully planned, which is worthy of praise.</p>

<p>The bank is moving into a new building for business and does not want to follow the trend of using gifts to attract customers. However, to commemorate the new building, it has specially collected information on commerce, economics, and daily social affairs, and compiled a book called "Daily Essentials," which is very exquisite in content and decoration. It will be given to customers for browsing and as a souvenir.</p>

<p>The Zhengyi Society of Shanghai, which is established by famous figures in the industrial and commercial circles, is well-organized and dedicated to cultivating emotional ties outside of work. Therefore, members are eager to join every time members are recruited, and the club's affairs have become developed as a result. The society also has two departments: charity and mutual assistance. Every summer, it provides free medical consultations and medicine to benefit the poor and sick. It also does its best to promote other public welfare activities, and it is well-known and respected. Recently, the members of the society, Shao Daren, Tong Shen, Wang Jingshan, and Jun, believe that Qingdao is located in Jiaodong, surrounded by the sea on three sides, with natural scenery and a cool climate, making it a summer resort. Therefore, they specially initiated a trip to Qingdao to seek the pleasure of health for the members. The travel minister of the society, Xu Jianruo, made careful arrangements and set off today on the Puan Express ship of the China Merchants Bureau. There are more than 30 participants. It is heard that the political and business circles of Qingdao and the individuals of the society have very harmonious personal feelings. They have sent a telegram expressing their welcome to the members of the society to Qingdao.

<p>The YWCA Hostel at No. 731 Diswei Road, Shanghai, has a quiet location and convenient transportation, making it suitable for accommodation. Therefore, since its restoration after the war, there has been a boom in the number of guests. However, due to the construction of roads beyond the border, the telephone cannot be reinstalled, which seems to be inconvenient for the hostel. It is now heard that after many negotiations, the telephone was finally installed last week, with the number 43535. Anyone who wants to contact or inquire can use the telephone to avoid the trouble of traveling back and forth in person.</p>

<p>丨Starting this month, reports will be issued weekly丨</p>
<p>The Municipal Health Bureau, considering that epidemics are likely to spread since the start of summer, has been actively carrying out various epidemic prevention measures. Starting this month (August), it will resume testing tap water in the city, starting with the two water districts of the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company and the Nanshi Chinese Business Water and Electricity Company.

If there are any unclean or harmful ingredients, measures will be taken to ban and improve them. The test results will be reported to the public every week to ensure that the public is aware of and pays attention to prevention. At the same time, infectious disease testing and mortality reports will be carried out, and the state of epidemic diseases in the city will be announced to the public to raise awareness. The above two items have been published by the Health Bureau in the Shen, Xin, Shishi, Min, Chen, Shishi newspapers, and the English Continental Daily on a regular basis.

<p>French Concession Tram Routes 3, 5, and 6 also increase fares because they run in the Chinese area. The fare increase of the Chinese Concession Tram Company has been approved by the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau and is scheduled to be implemented today. French Concession Tram routes 3, 5, and 6 were not increased when the company increased fares in February of this year, because route 3 runs between the West Gate and the Xiaodongmen in the Chinese area, and routes 5 and 6 also have a section in the Chinese area, which is the same as the Chinese Concession Tram routes. Therefore, it was not possible to increase fares at that time. Now that the Chinese Concession has increased fares, these three routes are also scheduled to increase fares simultaneously today. The prices are the same as those of the Chinese Concession.</p>

The director of the transportation department of the company, Lu Zhonglin, and Du Ningru, also convened a meeting of inspectors and ticket checkers at the company at 3:00 PM yesterday to organize internal affairs. They also notified the transportation staff, roughly stating: This company's revised tram fares have been submitted to the municipal government for approval and are scheduled to be implemented on August 1st. In addition to posting the newly revised price list for each route on the vehicles for public viewing, a table of station counts has been printed and distributed with the ticket boxes so that ticket sellers can read and memorize them to avoid errors. However, as the new fares are being implemented for the first time, some passengers may not fully understand and may easily misunderstand. All ticket sellers must be polite and explain kindly, and all inspectors and ticket checkers must pay attention and correct them at any time. Also, because the track connection project at Nanyang Bridge and Hugunying has not been completed, the routes of the No. 2 and 4 trams will temporarily follow the original routes. All fares will be handled in accordance with the newly revised regulations. The summary of the price increase is recorded below: (First-Class Fare) 8 cents for one station, 10 cents for two stations, 13 cents for three stations, 16 cents for four stations, 19 cents for five stations, 22 cents for six stations, 26 cents for seven stations. (Second-Class Fare) 5 cents for one station, 7 cents for two stations, 9 cents for three stations, 12 cents for four stations, 15 cents for five stations, 17 cents for six stations, 19 cents for seven stations.</p>

<p>The results of the examination showed no cholera germs. Citizens are encouraged to receive injections for prevention. Recently, reports stated that cholera had occurred in Caojiadu, Huxi, in this city. The Health Bureau sent personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and sent the feces of suspected cholera patients to the Health Laboratory for examination to clarify the situation. The examination results showed no cholera germs. The reports were false. Generally, citizens who have not studied medicine do not understand the scientific differentiation of symptoms. They often mistakenly attribute heatstroke or other causes of vomiting and diarrhea to cholera, leading to the spread of misinformation and sensational reports in newspapers. However, the Health Bureau is actively carrying out epidemic prevention during the summer and autumn seasons. Citizens are strongly encouraged to receive cholera vaccinations to increase their immunity to epidemics and to avoid drinking raw water or its mixtures. Fly eradication should be strictly implemented to prevent transmission.</p>

<p>Flourishing passenger transport between Shanghai and Japan leads to the addition of the "Omi Maru" to the route.</p>
<h3 id="e204">NYK Increases Ships <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the passenger ships of the Nippon Yusen Kaisha (NYK) between Shanghai and Japan, namely the "Shanghai Maru" and "Nagasaki Maru," have been insufficient to meet the demand of passengers in Shanghai. The other six ships, including the "Rokko Maru," "Maya Maru," and "Aso Maru," only have third-class cabins and no first-class cabins. This has led to repeated instances of the "Shanghai Maru" and other ships being fully booked and tickets being returned. The Shanghai branch of the company has telegraphed the Tokyo head office requesting additional passenger ships on the Shanghai-Kobe-Osaka route to meet the demand. The head office has replied to Shanghai that the 4,200-ton passenger ship "Omi Maru," which sails to the South Sea Islands, will be added to the China-Japan route. The ship has first, second, and third-class cabins. The first sailing should arrive today, and it will then be dedicated to the Shanghai-Japan route. In the current sluggishness of shipping in various routes, the flourishing of the China-Japan route is truly a special situation.</p>

<p>Japanese people's efforts in promoting foreign trade are unmatched by those of other countries. In recent years, after the September 18th Incident, they have been affected by the boycott of Japanese goods in various parts of our country, leading to overproduction and stockpiles of goods. Although they can now be successively transported to various ports along our Yangtze River, purchasing power is minimal. The boycott of Japanese goods in various ports in Southeast Asia continues unabated. The Japanese have changed their strategy, transferring large quantities of Japanese goods to the South Seas Islands and West Africa for dumping at reduced prices. The Osaka Company and Mitsui &amp; Co. have, at the request of various Japanese merchants, opened a new shipping route from Japan and Shanghai to Siam, specifically to transport Japanese goods to Siam. Currently, Osaka and Mitsui have each dispatched two ships to Siam.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Accepting Subsidies <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The Nisshin Kisen Kaisha (Japanese Mail Steamship Company) in this port has suspended operations for a year and a half. Four ships operate on the Yangtze River, averaging less than one or two hundred tons of cargo per trip. Now that the Sino-Japanese war is over, Japanese businesses in China are seeking to recover. Nisshin is also requesting a subsidy of two million yuan from the government to revive the Yangtze River and North-South shipping routes. At the same time, President Baron Takashi Fukao has personally come to Shanghai to negotiate the resumption of services. Now that Fukao has returned to Tokyo, the Japanese government's subsidy to Nisshin has been approved by the Ministry of Communications for 970,000 Japanese yen. Now that the funds are available for collection, Nisshin's resumption plan will add more departures on the upper and lower reaches of the Yangtze River once the funds arrive.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Autumn House Tax in This City <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The Finance Bureau Announces the Collection Starting Today. The City Finance Bureau issued Announcement No. 219 yesterday regarding the collection of the autumn house tax in this city: In order to collect the house tax, the city is divided into four seasons. The four collection offices in the east, south, west, and north of this bureau each assign collectors within their jurisdiction to collect the tax based on the house tax receipts. The paper color of these house tax receipts changes every quarter. The back of the receipt contains important information, and the front specifies the taxpayer's address, house number, and amount of tax paid. The receipt is stamped with the seal of this bureau to ensure its authenticity. This procedure has been in place for some time. Now, to strictly prevent the forgery of house tax receipts and eliminate malfeasance, starting from the collection of this year's autumn house tax, each page of the receipt will be perforated and stamped with the round seal of the respective collection office. Starting from August 1st, all collectors will wear uniforms when collecting taxes. Taxpayers may request to see the collector's identification card with their photograph affixed to it. If anyone is found carrying forged receipts and collecting tax fraudulently, they should be immediately handed over to the police. After this announcement, if taxpayers fail to verify the collector's identity and are deceived, the taxpayer will still be required to pay the house tax to maintain city tax revenue. This announcement is made to notify all relevant parties, including the municipal government and all collection offices of this bureau, for compliance.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Detective is Too Ignorant <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Mistakenly Identifying a Respectable Woman as a Prostitute. Section Chief Yi from the First Branch of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau Requests a Thorough Investigation from the French Authorities. Madam Yi, the wife of Section Chief Yi Renzhi of the First Branch of the First District of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, took a girl with her in a private chartered car to visit relatives in the French Concession at around 9 p.m. on the 23rd of last month. While passing the Taohuagong Restaurant at the southern end of the Great World on Avenue Edward VII, a large man in a short silk shirt and pants stopped the chartered car and ordered Madam Yi to get out of the car and accompany him. Madam Yi, seeing that the man looked fierce and suspecting that he was up to no good, refused sternly. Passersby stopped to watch, blocking the road. While they were in a dilemma, Lu Ying, the captain of the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team, was at a banquet at the YMCA. Lu's guard, Mr. Hong, noticed the crowd and, fearing an accident, pushed his way through the crowd. He saw Madam Yi, the wife of Section Chief Yi, and her daughter in the chartered car. Hong was familiar with Madam Yi, so he questioned the large man. The large man said that Hong was meddling in his business and claimed to be surnamed Yang, a detective from the French Concession's gambling squad. He said that he was patrolling and saw Madam Yi in fancy clothes and makeup and suspected that she was a prostitute, so he wanted to arrest her. Hong asked if he had a detective license. Yang replied that he did not have his license with him, and he took out a handgun and handcuffs to prove his identity. Hong also showed his handgun for self-defense. Yang then realized his mistake and left angrily. Section Chief Yi was extremely angry when he heard about the incident. He thought that since the detective was a public official of the police department, he should have undergone some training and have the appropriate judgment and knowledge to perform his duties. Now, the detective was not carrying a license while on duty and was only carrying a handgun. He could not distinguish between good and bad and stopped the car on the road. If someone suspected him of being a highway robber and an accident occurred, who would be responsible? Moreover, Madam Yi is plump, over thirty years old, and with a girl. It is obvious that she is a respectable woman. Now, the detective did not even have this basic knowledge. In the future, whenever a respectable woman passes through the French Concession in fancy clothes and makeup, everyone will feel insecure and have no protection. Therefore, Section Chief Yi translated a formal letter into French a few days ago (last Saturday) and sent it directly to the French Concession police authorities, requesting a thorough investigation and attention to this matter.</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Fierce Competition in the Petroleum Industry Will Tend Towards Compromise and Equal Sales <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The Price of Kerosene May Rise Slightly</p>
<p>The three major companies that control the petroleum industry, namely Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum Company, and Deutsche Vacuum Oel AG, have branch companies and agencies throughout the country since they started selling in China. However, recently, Russian oil has been dumped in China, and the Guanghua Oil Company, managed by Chinese, has been appointed as the agent, thus starting a fierce competition. Currently, the price of gasoline in this port is uniformly marked at 8 cents per gallon by Mobil and the other three major companies, but the net price is only 6.8 cents when purchased wholesale from Guanghua, while Mobil and the other three companies sell it at 7 cents. Guanghua is 2 cents cheaper than other companies. Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Guanghua specifically. According to the director of its gasoline department, the company's sales performance in the first six months of the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933) was 1.4 million gallons of gasoline and 1.5 million boxes of kerosene (10 gallons per box). The source is entirely from the Russian Oil Export Company, with production originating in Batum, Russia. Recently, the company has divided the country into four central regions: first, Shanghai, which includes the surrounding provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang; second, Hong Kong; third, Hankou; and fourth, Qingdao. The reason why the North China center is located in Qingdao instead of Tianjin or Beijing is because the North China kerosene business is currently contracted to the Dahua Company. The company now prices its products the same as other companies. In reality, other companies cannot further reduce prices to compete. Therefore, in the near future, gasoline prices are unlikely to fluctuate drastically, while kerosene prices may rise slightly. The reporter asked if Guanghua had signed an agreement with other companies to equalize sales and stop lowering prices in order to reach a compromise. The response was that there was no written agreement, but there had been considerable verbal negotiation. Therefore, they will seek a compromise through understanding and temporarily stop competing to avoid further losses.</p>

It also includes a practical handbook, making it a reference book needed by people from all walks of life. Since its publication, it has been extremely popular in society. The Shen Bao Yearbook Society is deeply concerned that the scope of the book is too broad, and errors are inevitable. It has separately requested review and correction from national political organizations, social groups, and specialized scholars in order to make corrections. The Society has now received more than 200 replies from various parties, mostly expressing satisfaction. For example, the Secretariat of the Legislative Yuan replied, "The collection is extensive, the editing is meticulous, and it is truly a monumental work." The Examination Yuan replied, "Overall, it is appropriate and requires no supplementation." The Ministry of Communications replied, "The content is rich, the tables are detailed, it is a monumental compilation, and it is a valuable reference." Other central government agencies, provincial governments and civil affairs departments, and organizations have also responded. Recently, several experts and readers of the Yearbook have directly questioned discrepancies between statistics published in the Yearbook and those found elsewhere. In addition to carefully verifying the basis and replying separately, the Society has also found errors due to careless proofreading in the book. Therefore, it is specifically re-checking and preparing to print an errata sheet to distribute to readers, as well as conducting its own review under more than 1,500 detailed items. However, omissions may still be inevitable. Therefore, this advertisement is published to solicit criticism from experts and readers, and to inform them of any errors they find.</p>

<p>To the Editor: The news item published in today's edition of your newspaper, under the "Local News" column, regarding the relocation of the Marine Products and Sundries Association back to its original address, is inaccurate. The building at Dianchun Hall, located at the City God Temple, is owned by our association. On the 29th of this month, a group claiming to be members of the Marine Products Industry Association forcibly entered the premises. Our association is currently seeking legal remedies. The original article contained inaccuracies. We respectfully request that you publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column to correct the record. Sincerely, Shanghai Sugar Industry Association. July 31.</p>
<p>To the Editor: On July 21st, your newspaper published a news item about a fire at Yao Xingchang Machinery Factory on Xiaoshadu Road. In fact, the fire occurred at a business next door to Yao Xingchang, and thankfully, the fire trucks arrived quickly and extinguished the fire. Yao Xingchang suffered no losses whatsoever. We are deeply concerned that the outside world may misunderstand and that our business will be affected. Therefore, we are writing to your newspaper to request that you publish a correction in the "Letters to the Editor" column. Sincerely, Yao Xingchang. July 31.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Important News: Jiangxi Province's Junior and Senior High School Entrance Examinations Proceed Smoothly <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Elementary School Results Better than High School; Schools Outside the Provincial Capital Worse than those in the Capital.  Cheng Shih-kuei, Director of the Jiangxi Provincial Department of Education, was ordered to handle the graduation examinations for elementary and secondary schools. Due to thorough preparation and strict security measures, the process has been proceeding smoothly.  The province's high schools were divided into six districts, and five provincial supervisors, Xiao Qian, Ouyang Kui, Zhou Ke-gang, Tu Lin, and Long Cheng, were appointed to head the examination offices at each district's testing location.  Principals of various secondary schools and magistrates of the counties where the districts were located were also appointed as supervising commissioners to assist in the process. However, due to inconvenient transportation in the fourth district, Yichun and Pingxiang were divided into two testing locations.  Provincial Supervisor Shao De-ji was specially dispatched to Pingxiang to oversee the proceedings. The entire province uniformly conducted the examinations on the 26th of last month.  The first district, Nanchang, was divided into four testing venues. The first venue, located at the Women's Vocational School, was for the high school students from various schools. The second, third, and fourth venues were located at the Second Middle School, the First Women's Middle School, and the Second Vocational School, and the Third Vocational School respectively, serving as testing locations for junior high school students.  Representatives from the provincial government and the court were also invited to supervise the venues. The junior high school examinations lasted three consecutive days, and the high school examinations lasted four consecutive days.  Over 800 junior high school students and over 140 high school students in the first district were able to submit their papers on time. Reports from other districts have also been successively sent back to the province.  The elementary school graduation examinations were held on the 29th and 30th. A total of 650 students from 36 elementary schools in Nanchang participated in the examinations. Four students, who were temporarily ill, did not take the exam.  Officials at the Department of Education have been extremely busy reviewing the examination results submitted by various elementary and secondary schools, and this process is nearing completion. It is said that elementary school results are better than those of high schools, while the results of high schools outside the provincial capital are worse than those in the capital. Although the results are not entirely satisfactory, the overall order of the provincial examinations was satisfactory, and no other incidents occurred.  This is considered passable.</p>

<h3 id="e227">Important Telegram on the Resolution of the Anhui Education Uprising <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The Provincial Department of Education wired the resolution process: Since the outbreak of this provincial capital education uprising, all parties have attached great importance to it. The newspapers have reported it. Chairman Liu has repeatedly telegraphed the Department of Education from Guangxi to inquire about it and instructed on the handling policy. After investigation, the incident has been handled calmly by the Provincial Government and the Department of Education. The Central Government and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek have dealt with it severely, and it has now been completely quelled. It is reported that the Anhui Provincial Department of Education yesterday reported the handling process to Chairman Liu by telegram. The original telegrams of Chairman Liu and the Department of Education are extracted as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman Liu's Respectful Telegram to the Department of Education: "To Governor Ma and Director Yang of the Provincial Government, I have received the telegrams and attachments from Brothers Lingfu and Haodian, and Brother Simo and Xiaodian. They are stored in secret. Because the communists are rampant and I am engaged in the suppression, I have no time to take care of Anhui's political affairs, so I have repeatedly telegraphed, advocating a peaceful settlement. Recently, I received a telegram from Brother Simo and Xiaodian, and learned about the entire process. The accommodation and compromise have been meticulous, and the sabotage of a few individuals is a disgrace to the education community of Anhui. Brother Lingfu's telegram reported that Xie Jiaxi and other faculty and staff of the high school actually destroyed the Director's office and injured the staff. Such out-of-bounds actions are obviously a violation of criminal law and should be handed over to the court for legal action. Fortunately, the examinations have been completed and do not affect the students. The two high schools, No. 1 Middle School, can be reorganized calmly. The future of education is cause for celebration. This is a special reply. Respectfully, Liu Zhenhua."</p>
<p>The Department of Education's Grateful Telegram to Chairman Liu: "To Chairman Liu in Guangxi, I have received your secret telegram, and I am very grateful for everything. Since I took office, I have followed your instructions to be pragmatic and realistic in Anhui's education, and strive for rectification. At the beginning of taking office, I immediately handled the examination matters. All measures were carefully considered according to laws and facts, and strived to be implemented without obstruction. Although I relied on your virtue and power to enable the vast majority of students to take the exam willingly, due to my lack of virtue and prestige, the disturbances were inevitable. I have served without any similarity and have not had time to wait for punishment. I am very grateful for your praise in the telegram. After reading it, I only increase my shame and fear. After that, I should work harder to live up to your expectations. Now the examination matters have been completely concluded, and the aftermath of the disturbance has also been handled carefully in accordance with acting Chairman Ma. The principals who failed to handle the examinations have been dismissed by the Provincial Government meeting. The new principals are also taking over in order. Xie Hongsheng and other faculty and staff who disrupted the office have been ordered by the Provincial Government to be arrested. Li Guansan has been arrested and handed over to the court for legal judgment. Now the new academic year is about to begin. Because I have received telegrams from Chairman Chiang of the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Education and your order to rectify education in a timely manner to eliminate accumulated malpractices, I have reported to the Provincial Government and made appropriate changes to the principals of provincial schools, in order to make people worthy of their posts. In the future, all reforms are being planned comprehensively, and I will report to acting Chairman Ma for handling at any time, and ask you to give instructions when you are free from military affairs, so that I can follow and avoid being negligent. The original telegram of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek was sent to you. The original text is: "To Chairman Liu Xueya of Anqing, the educational elements in Anhui Province are complicated and the content is not good. The situation below middle schools is even worse. Now it is the summer vacation. I hope you will instruct Director Yang of the Education Department to seriously rectify and strive to improve, which is very fortunate. Zhongzheng Yuanji Gu Yin." It should be reported to you by acting Chairman Ma. The details may have been reported to you by acting Chairman Ma. Combine the statements, Minister of Education Yang Lian respectfully."</p>

<h3 id="e233">Chinese Open Tennis Singles Today, Yu and Wang Compete for the Final Spot <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>At 4 PM this afternoon at the Chinese Tennis Court. Yesterday's makeup match: Wang Wenzheng defeated Sun Linfang. Zheng Zhaojia's semi-final was postponed due to illness yesterday. In the Chinese Open Tennis Singles, Zheng Zhaojia vs. Ma Anquan was originally scheduled to hold the semi-final yesterday, but Zheng Zhaojia was unable to attend due to illness. The match was postponed. Wang Wenzheng and Sun Linfang's third week makeup match, Wang Wenzheng won 3-1. Today at 4 PM, Yu Tianguang and Wang Wenzheng will hold the semi-final, details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e234">Wang Wenzheng Defeated Sun Linfang <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Wang Wenzheng was originally the ball court manager of the tennis department of the Citibank General Association, he gave up his professional qualification last year and requested the All-China Athletic Advancement Association to restore his amateur election right. He was granted a one-year recuperation permit by the Athletic Advancement Association. Mr. Wang was able to participate in the competition with amateur qualifications again. He has repeatedly shown his skills in the Green Light Team of the Xianfang Cup, and his ball skills have been appreciated by the general public. In this Chinese Open Singles Tournament, he had a bye in the first week, and Zheng Zirong withdrew in the second week, so Wang entered the third week (semi-final) without laboring. He met Sun Linfang, which was originally scheduled to be played on Thursday last week, but was changed to yesterday due to other matters. Wang lost the first set, and then won three consecutive sets and won. Today he will meet Yu Tianguang in the semi-final week. Yesterday's results are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng 3|6 6|1 6|3 6|1 Sun Linfang</p>
<h3 id="e235">The Situation of the Competition between Wang and Sun <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>In the first set, Wang Wenzheng showed quite a bit of timidity. Hu Xiansheng, a member of the Chinese Tennis Committee and the donor of the grand silver cup award for the competition, criticized that, given his seniority, he should not have the problem of timidity. At the same time, Sun Linfang fought with special humility and had few mistakes. When Wang Wenzheng went online, Sun broke through his defense line on the boundary and returned with a score of 6 to 3, giving Sun the victory. In the second set, Wang's left and right diagonal shots were full of vitality, making Sun tired of running around. Although he tried hard to cheer up, he couldn't get it. Wang easily won the second set with 6 to 1. In the third set, both sides made mistakes, but Wang Wenzheng's skillful left and right diagonal shots still made Sun Linfang suffer. Wang won again with 6 to 3. In the fourth set, Sun Linfang had nothing to offer, and the balls that were very easy to return often touched the net, making Wang Wenzheng win five consecutive games without much effort. After Wang gave away one game, he won with 6 to 1.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Talking about Today's Battle between Yu and Wang <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>After Wang eliminated Sun Linfang, he will play the semi-final with Yu Tianguang at the Chinese Tennis Court at 4 PM this afternoon. Mr. Yu is one of the best among the new young players, and Mr. Wang is an old veteran, but he is still a "dark horse" in the championship for the first time. According to the criticism of the general public, Wang is not only likely to win Yu Tianguang, but also has the possibility of defeating Zheng Zhaojia. Because he is rich in experience, he rarely commits suicide, which is also reasonable. Judging from Wang's technique, he is good at being steady and has few suicides. He has a good grasp of diagonal shots. When there is an opportunity, he will be able to control the enemy to an irreparable situation. His backhand is slightly weaker, and his online play has no special features. His serve is sure and has little hard work. However, if Yu Tianguang can go online and get the right method, he may be able to win Wang. If he uses baseline shots, Wang can definitely win. In any case, there will be a fierce battle between Yu and Wang today.</p>

In this year's competition, if Ke Xian defeated Pan Lai on the first day, he could continue to maintain his victory. British players such as Austin and Pan Lai have excellent skills and are considered top-notch. They have their own way of winning. Unfortunately, the United States has many famous players, but they were defeated by Britain in the intercontinental final, which was not expected by the public. The details of today's competition are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e238">Ke Xian Defeated Austin <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Each won two sets. In the first group of the competition, in the first three sets, the score was 5-7, 6-4, 4-6. Austin took the lead, and the situation was unfavorable for Ke Xian. At the beginning of the fourth set, both sides were cautious and took a defensive stance. However, if the other side showed a slight weakness, they would immediately take the opportunity to attack. Austin won two games first. Ke Xian won the ball in the third game, and Austin also won the fourth game. At that time, the score was 3 to 1. Ke Xian tried his best to cheer up and managed to tie the score to 3 to 3. Austin forced Ke Xian to stay at the baseline with a deep forehand, so he was able to take the lead with 4 to 3. Ke Xian then made it 4 to 4 and took the lead with 5 to 4, and finally</p>
<p>won with 6 to 4.</p>
<p>In the final battle, at the beginning of the last set, both sides won one game each. Austin took the lead with 2 to 1, followed by 3 to 1 and 4 to 2. Austin's victory seemed to be beyond doubt. However, Ke Xian made every effort to attack and made Austin run around the field, not having time to return the attack. Austin wanted to intercept online, but Ke Xian stopped him with a high ball. Ke Xian was cheered by the audience and aroused his spirit, so he was able to save the dangerous situation with 4 to 4, and then took the lead with 5 to 4, and finally won with 6 to 4.</p>
<h3 id="e239">Pan Lei Defeats Mo Lin <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>In the final match of the first set, Mo Lin faced Pan Lei. Both sides won two games each. Mo Lin then won three consecutive games, taking the lead at five to two, and eventually won the first set six to four.</p>
<p>In the second set, the two sides formally contended. Pan Lei began with an aggressive attack, shifting the momentum. However, Mo Lin did not lose hope, returning every ball sent his way, earning applause from the audience for his brilliant plays. In the second set, Mo Lin initially led with two to zero, then three to one. However, Pan Lei launched a fierce counterattack, using powerful forehand shots to tie the score at three to three, followed by four to three. Mo Lin then won two consecutive games, taking the lead again at five to four, and had two opportunities to win the set, but unfortunately missed both. Pan Lei seized the opportunity to win two consecutive games, taking the lead at six to five. Pan also had three opportunities to win, but Mo Lin managed to win back one game, tying the score at six to six. However, Mo's performance declined from then on, and Pan eventually won the second set eight to six.</p>
<p>Third Set. In the third set, Mo exerted himself too much, inevitably becoming fatigued, resulting in a significant decline in performance. Despite his best efforts, Pan Lei proved to be the superior player. Mo Lin won the first game, but Pan Lei then won four consecutive games, taking the lead at four to one. Mo won back one game, making it four to two, but Pan Lei eventually won the third set six to two.</p>
<p>Fourth Set. After a break, the match continued. Pan Lei's skill was clearly superior to Mo Lin's, but Mo did not lose heart and continued to return every ball to the best of his ability. After each side won one game, Pan Lei used long-distance forehand shots to hit the corners of the court, forcing Mo Lin to run around and make difficult returns, giving Pan a four to one lead. At this point, Mo Lin returned a ball, but the landing point was not very clear, and Pan Lei was unable to return it, showing signs of frustration. Mo Lin seized the opportunity to tie the score at four to four, then five to five, but his strength was exhausted at this point. Pan gradually won two consecutive games, ultimately winning with a score of seven to five.</p>

<h3 id="e241">National Games Organizing Committee to Take Over Site This Morning <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>Chief Director Chu, Deputy Chief Director Zhang Xinfu, Deputy Chief Director Wu Yunrui, and members of the organizing committee Hao Gengsheng, Yuan Dunli, Shen Siliang, Ma Xun, Zhang Jiong, Xu Yusheng, Du Tingxiu, and heads of various departments including Lei Zhen (General Affairs), Wu Zhuozhi (Transportation), Xu Yanzi (Prizes), and Peng Baichuan (Documentation), totaling more than ten people, traveled to the Central Stadium by Jiangnan Changsui car at 7:30 AM on the 30th to inspect the site. The purpose was to decide on issues such as the installation of water and electricity, as well as how to repair and renovate the facility. Director Zhang led the inspection of the various competition venues and the track. They finished around 10:00 AM and returned to the city. The current condition of the Central Stadium is briefly described below:</p>
<p>(1) The Central Stadium is located at the southern foot of Zhongshan Mountain, in the southeast corner of Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum, about eight li from the city. It can be reached directly by public bus, which takes about 25 minutes. Construction of the stadium began in 1930 and was completed in 1931, costing approximately 1.6 million yuan. After the 1931 National Games were cancelled, the entire facility fell into disuse. Only the swimming pool was open briefly last summer. This year, due to insufficient water supply, it has not reopened. The Mausoleum Management Committee spends 2,000 yuan per month to maintain the facility, and employs a number of staff to manage the site. The minutes of the third working meeting of the stadium on July 25 are supplemented below, which show a general picture of the work + situation: Attendees included Lin Huguang, Hua Guangli, Fu Huangguang, Huang Ziquan, Fei Jizong, and Wang Rulin. Matters decided upon: (1) Regarding gardens, grass laying, and sunflower fertilization, the matter will be submitted to Chairman Lin for handling. The weeds in the entire stadium are too overgrown and should be removed selectively. The garden engineering work for the 22nd National Games will commence on August 1. (2) Regarding engineering, dredging of the drainage ditches around the football field will continue, as well as repairs to the sidewalks on the main road. (3) Regarding general affairs, a general register of furniture for the venue should be created and submitted to the Mausoleum Committee to discuss how to lend it to the 22nd National Games.</p>
<p>(2) The venue is oval-shaped, with concrete stands all around. There is no damage, and it can accommodate approximately 30,000 to 50,000 spectators. The grass on the track in the middle is overgrown, which will be removed urgently, and the track will be re-laid. Both ends of the track are surrounded by wire mesh, which will serve as the finals venues for volleyball, basketball, and national martial arts.</p>
<p>(3) The athletes' dormitories are located under the east and west stands. Each room can accommodate 24 people, and the beds are fully equipped. Running water, bathtubs, and flush toilets are all readily available.</p>
<p>(4) The basketball court is very close to the venue, located northwest of the stadium entrance. It is an open-air court in a sunken style. The concrete stands around it are still in good condition, but the floor is damaged. The National Games Organizing Committee will re-surface and paint it. The martial arts court is located south of the basketball court and has a similar style, but it is circular. The court is made of dirt, and the grass is several feet deep. Measures must be taken to clean it up. There are a total of twelve tennis courts. Except for the court used by the stadium staff, which is still in good condition, the rest all need to be resurfaced. North of the basketball court is the swimming pool. Although the pool is not damaged, there is no water supply. It is reported that the National Games Organizing Committee plans to build a large artesian well to fully supply water to the venue. This project will cost more than 10,000 yuan and must begin construction within days. Opposite the swimming pool is the baseball field. The field is small and may not be suitable for use. In addition, the race track and football field are currently planted with soybeans, which are growing vigorously. It would be a pity to cut them down before they are ripe. It is said that they will be repaired after the harvest.</p>
<p>(5) 136 silver prizes were received for the 20th National Games, and a clear register has been created. Director Xu Yanzi of the Prizes Department has inspected them once, and they will be officially inventoried and transferred for use as prizes for this year's event on August 1. The remaining medals and badges for the organizing committee staff, etc., will all be those already made in 1931, in order to reuse waste and save expenses.</p>
<h3 id="e242">Discussion of Water Supply and Other Issues <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>After the inspection, the standing committee members held a standing committee meeting in the Ministry of Education. The heads of each group also participated in the discussion on the water supply for the venue. It is estimated that the total number of athletes and organizing committee staff during the Games will be no less than 2,000 people. Each person needs at least 50 gallons of water per day (including [drinking] [use]), so the daily water demand must be around 100,000 gallons. In addition, there is also a lack of water source for the swimming pool. Although there are five artesian wells at the venue, only two are usable, which is far from the required amount. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to immediately send a letter to the Ministry of Interior's Health Department requesting them to send personnel to test the well water at the venue. If it is drinkable, the artesian wells will be dredged one by one for drinking. At the same time, a letter will be sent to the municipal government to rush the connection of tap water pipes. However, the estimated cost is over 10,000 yuan, and efforts will be made to save money. Regarding the swimming pool, it is planned to borrow the newly built swimming pool of the Central Military Academy.</p>
<h3 id="e243">Site to be Taken Over Today <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the takeover of the site, the organizing committee has agreed with the Mausoleum Management Committee to borrow it for three months starting from August 1, and has appointed Zhang Xinfu, Lei Zhen, and Peng Baichuan to handle the takeover matters. Zhang and others are scheduled to officially take over today. It is said that the first step after the takeover is to handle the water connection and cut the weeds, and delineate the area. The organizing committee's office has decided to temporarily set up two locations. One is the old site of the Ministry of Education's Compilation and Translation Bureau, because the bureau is located within the Ministry of Education. In order to facilitate communication and coordination before the Games, it is planned to borrow the location to handle documentation matters. The other location is the Central Stadium, where the person in charge will handle the site arrangement. They will rush to start working there tomorrow. On September 1, the secretariat will be officially established at the venue.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, July 31) The National Games Organizing Committee held a standing committee meeting on the evening of the 31st to discuss the post-takeover arrangements and issues such as sports rules and funding. The site takeover is scheduled for the morning of the 1st, with Zhang Xinfu and two others going.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Games Budget Must Be Increased <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>The provisional budget for the National Games was originally set at 93,000 yuan by the organizing committee. When it was submitted to the central government for review, it was reduced to 50,000 yuan in view of the current difficult financial situation of the national treasury, and the need to host everything economically. Yesterday, according to Chu Minyi, the organizing committee has only received 5,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance so far. The organizing committee has budgeted the entire cost at 50,000 yuan, which is definitely not</p>
<p>enough. Furthermore, the site takeover is imminent, and funds are urgently needed. He has telegraphed Chairman Chiang, President Wang, and Minister Zhu, requesting them to find ways to increase the amount to the previous figure, so as to avoid running out of funds when the event arrives.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Hao Gengsheng Talks About the Success of the North China Games <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Newspaper Association hosted a banquet last night for Hao Gengsheng, Chief Director of the recently concluded North China Games. He recently traveled from Qingdao to Beijing on official business, and arrived in Shanghai from Beijing yesterday. He will return to Qingdao today. The Shanghai Newspaper Association, in recognition of the exceptional cooperation between the North China Games and Shanghai newspapers, especially the contributions of Mr. Hao, specially hosted a banquet at Yizhixiang to welcome him and express gratitude. Sports reporters from various newspapers accompanied him. During the banquet, Mr. Hao reported on the efforts made in organizing the North China Games and some of its successes. His words were sincere and thought-provoking. A brief summary is as follows:</p>
<p>Three years ago in Shenyang, the North China Games were held this time in Qingdao. At that time, given the critical situation in North China, it was like Shenyang three years ago. Although the North China Games had fourteen units, the four northeastern provinces had already fallen into the hands of the Japanese. However, in this difficult situation, colleagues were even more determined to strive for success. They were cautious and worked together in a spirit of cooperation. The success of the North China Games this time was due to the full cooperation of all parties. The spirit of cooperation can be recorded as one.</p>
<p>The result of "foolish" hard work. Many people expressed doubts about holding the North China Games in Qingdao. Especially since Qingdao does not have many schools and is a mixed community of Chinese and foreigners, improper measures could damage the entire North China sports. In terms of venues, after some painstaking negotiations, they were obtained from foreigners. Therefore, all measures were taken carefully and carried out according to plan to avoid giving people excuses. The opening ceremony, awarding of prizes, and all ceremonies were modeled after the Olympic Games. From the opening to the closing, everything was orderly, leaving a good impression. Therefore, after the closing ceremony, a Western newspaper in Qingdao, which had previously launched attacks, wrote a long and favorable review, praising it extensively. The conclusion only said that what was lacking was weak performance. The success of the North China Games is said by some to be the result of our "foolish" hard work.</p>
<p>A glimpse of the results. The results achieved by the North China Games this time are incomparable to the Far East and the world. Foreigners will laugh when they hear it, and Chinese people will laugh when they see it. However, as a result of hard work, eight national records were broken, twelve North China records were broken, two equaled national records, and thirty-five individuals broke records. This is still somewhat comforting in the midst of disappointment. Shanghai's sports have more opportunities to come into contact with foreigners, so progress is easier than in North China. We deeply hope that we will all promote it and work together to raise our country's records day by day.</p>

<p>— Runiu</p>
<p>There are legends about Zhang Xianzhong everywhere in China, which shows that everyone considers him to be quite unique. I was also one of the people who considered him to be quite unique.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I saw a book called "Wushuang Pu" (Table of Peerless Heroes), which was written by people in the early Qing Dynasty. It took extremely special and unique figures in history, drew a portrait of each, and wrote some poems on one side, but there seemed to be no bad people. Therefore, I later thought that I could choose the most special figures in history, who actually represent a kind of Chinese character, and write a Chinese "History of People," like Carlyle's "Heroes and Hero Worship" in England, and Emerson's "Representative Men" in America. However, it must include both good and bad, there are Su Wu who endured hardships by eating snow, Xuanzang who sought the law at the risk of his life, and Zhuge Liang who "exhausted himself to the utmost, and died only after death," but there are also Wang Mang who stubbornly believed in ancient methods and "died only after death," and Wang Anshi who half seriously and half jokingly reformed the law; Zhang Xianzhong was certainly also included. But now I have no intention of writing it at all.</p>
<p>Books like "Shu Bi" (History of Sichuan) record Zhang Xianzhong's murders in great detail, but they are also scattered, making it seem as if he was like "art for art's sake," specializing in "murder for murder's sake." He actually had other purposes. He did not kill many people at first, he certainly wanted to be the emperor. Later, he knew that Li Zicheng had entered Beijing, followed by the Qing army entering the pass, and he was left with only the road to decline, so he began to kill, kill... He clearly felt that the world no longer had anything of his own, and now he was destroying other people's things. This is exactly the same as the mood of some emperors in the late dynasties,</p>
<p>who burned the books, antiques, and treasures collected by their ancestors or themselves before they died. He still had soldiers, but no antiques, so he just killed, killed, killed...</p>
<p>But he still had to maintain the army, which was actually just maintaining the killing. He killed so many people that there were no common people left, so he sent many of his more trusted subordinates to the soldiers to eavesdrop. If there was any complaint, they would jump out, arrest him, and execute his entire family (his soldiers seemed to have families, perhaps they were captured women). He used killing to govern the army, and used the army to kill. He himself was finished, but he wanted to achieve the end of mutual destruction. Don't we also not cherish other people's or public things very much?</p>
<p>So Zhang Xianzhong's actions, although seemingly bizarre at first glance, are actually very ordinary. What is bizarre is how those people who were killed would always stretch out their necks and wait for him to kill, and only when Prince Su of the Qing Dynasty came to shoot him to death, did they become slaves and be saved, and even say that this was predestined, which is the so-called "playing the flute without bamboo, an arrow pierces the chest."</p>
<p>But I think that this prophecy poem was made up by later generations, and we don't know what people really thought at that time.</p>
<h3 id="e251">War and Peace <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Fei</p>
<p>Japan has occupied the Eastern Provinces and is now expanding its military in a frenzied manner, preparing for the final decisive battle to divide China. The reason is said to be "for the peace of the Orient." At the same time, according to recent reports, Kato Kanju, Akita Ryosuke, and others have launched a "Friends of Far East Peace Association" to support the anti-war conference convened by the world's writers Barbusse and others in Shanghai in September.</p>
<p>In the end, is the peace said by Party A the same thing as the peace said by Party B?</p>
<p>Obviously, the imperialists mean that if you give me everything I want, there will be peace. Otherwise, I will have no choice but to take "self-defense measures." To put it plainly, the peace they speak of is equivalent to war. The reason why they mention "peace" is just to create a smokescreen. Everyone knows that a smokescreen is a kind of weapon. But there are also people who truly love peace and oppose war, that is, the working masses under the heavy pressure of life. They know from the cruel experience of real life who the war is for, and who really suffers in the war are themselves and their fellow workers. They oppose war, and oppose those who incite war for their own benefit. Of course, this kind of understanding will lead them to a more active struggle.</p>
<p>However, in today's newspaper, a gentleman published a brilliant opinion in an article discussing the "Japanese Agricultural and Industrial Revolution" (?!): saying that the Japanese working farmers can only be liberated in a world war, and that opposing war will</p>
<p>"lead to the ridiculous conclusion of opposing world war, that is, opposing the Japanese agricultural and industrial revolution."</p>
<p>How is it? Is this conclusion ridiculous or not?</p>
<p>However, this gentleman has even more brilliant insights: saying that the Japanese people's opposition to war "is just pretending (?), and hypocritically expressing sympathy for Chinese friends, and showing that they are unwilling to lag behind," advising the Chinese people not to be "deceived" by them. Of course, we do not deny that there are many people who verbally say they oppose war to deceive people, just as we do not deny that there are many people who create reasons to "deceive" people into participating in war. But the genuine anti-war movement launched by the Japanese working masses is unrelated to this. Just</p>
<p>according to the Japanese government's announcement, in the past year alone, more than 7,000 Japanese revolutionary activists who took anti-war as one of their central tasks were arrested. And we know that dozens of these literally died. The Japanese masses want to use their freedom, blood, and lives to deceive the Chinese people, that deception is really stupid. It is far less effective than our smart people, who only need to write black characters on white paper.</p>
<p>Who is for war, who is for peace, the facts can testify for us.</p>
<h3 id="e252">"Letting Off Steam"-ism <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Among the very sparse audience, we watched Lubitsch's "Million Dollar Legs."</p>
<p>Some time ago, the Shanghai petty bourgeoisie had many answers to the question of "What would you do if you won 500,000 yuan?" But Lubitsch's ten answers to "If I Had a Million" were not liked by the Shanghai petty bourgeoisie, even though the aviation lottery was about to be drawn. Two of Lubitsch's answers were particularly profound: a prisoner about to be executed suddenly received a check for a million dollars; he walked to the execution ground, shouting "I am a millionaire." Then, three soldiers lightly used a check for a million dollars as payment for an old debt at a grocery store, watching the grocery store owner turn into a millionaire out of nowhere, while they stared blankly at the railing. The rest of those answers mostly wrote about the desires suppressed in the subconscious, which were greatly vented under the opportunity of a million-dollar check. A clerk in a porcelain shop, because of the compensation for breaking porcelain on weekdays, smashed the porcelain in the shop to his heart's content on this day; fashionable girls decorated their living rooms and bedrooms to their heart's content, turning the lights on and off; a small employee who had been feeling resentful for too long swaggered into the manager's office and scolded the manager before leaving; a couple who were upset that their new car had been hit bought eight cars and crashed them until they were all crashed. This is like Freud said, satisfying our desires in dreams; being oppressed by the economic system on weekdays, once we get the opportunity, we explode into a happy revenge, which is called "letting off steam"-ism.</p>
<p>Not only the chance of economic good luck, to make the suppressed desires erupt into a happy revenge; but the chance of power good luck will also play the same happy revenge. Usually hungry, we watch others eat steak and pigeon eggs outside the restaurant, swallowing our own taste; once we get rich, we must at least spit saliva on the waiter's face and eat the expensive dishes over and over again. People who are usually trampled on and insulted and dare not resist, once they have power in their hands, settle their grievances, someone is a high official in the court, someone is beheaded and exiled, stringing together a book of returning home in glory, giving the old friends a little color to see. The opposite of heroism seems to be "letting off steam"-ism. Since heroes are people who win the jackpot of the power lottery, the object of venting is of course our ordinary people. The power lottery must be constantly drawn, and the heroes who win the jackpot must be constantly produced. Our ordinary people are like the big and small porcelain in the porcelain shop, smashed batch after batch.</p>
<p>After letting off steam, then what? Soda water loses its fizz, leaving only a bowl of cold water; shochu loses its alcohol, leaving only a bowl of cold water. Porcelain shop clerks, fashionable girls, small employees, and couples, they all rented foreign buildings, bought cars, and hired many male and female servants, playing cards, and taking rides, and that's it. Will the heroes who win the power jackpot have other tricks?</p>
<p>So Lubitsch, he never dares to do a certain kind of experiment: either divide thousands of yuan to 10,000 people, or divide 10,000 yuan to a thousand people. Because if he did that, not only would the interweaving of tragedy, comedy, and tragicomedy be beyond the scope of several types, but it would also imply another major meaning.</p>
<h3 id="e253">Reading "An Outline of Literary Creation" <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>— Hanqi</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw someone advocating for adaptations based on original works in "Free Talk," and I wholeheartedly agreed. Previously, there were popular versions adapted from literary masterpieces like "Destruction" and "The Iron Flood." Later, I heard people say that the popularity of "Revolutionary Literary Giant Gorky," compiled and translated by Tao Fen, was due to the compiler's accessible and popular writing style. Now, "An Outline of Literary Creation," compiled and written by Mr. Hua Di, who aims to make theory accessible, has also been published. The compiler tells us that this book is largely adapted from Hiroshi Kawaguchi's "An Outline of Emerging Literature."</p>
<p>First of all, we must admit that the work of adaptation itself contains the meaning of popularization. Because, at least reading adapted works or theories can save us from memorizing names like "Dostoevsky," which are far removed from our lives, and from looking at the rather laborious words "circumstance" and "emphasis," as well as long sentences and complex grammar "that may be revised." This is the benefit of adaptation in terms of "form." At the same time, another main reason for adaptation is, taking "An Outline of Emerging Literature" as an example, it is certainly a good book in general, but if the original were selected and translated as is, it would cite many unfamiliar Japanese works, which would not only be incomprehensible to readers but also genuinely "uninteresting." Therefore, as long as the adapter has a deep understanding of the original text and replaces it with precise examples that do not conflict with the principles of the original, '...in China, such as Lu Xun's "The True Story of Ah Q"; and the recently published Mao Dun's "Midnight," etc.... can also be called a large-scale novel.' Like this sentence, readers who have read the book can understand it at a glance, and those who have not read it will not feel unfamiliar because the examples cited are "Chinese." This citation will further ignite the desire to read "the novels in the examples," and a sense of intimacy will arise spontaneously. Therefore, I acknowledge that Mr. Hua Di's adaptation work is extremely meaningful.</p>
<p>When reading translated books on literary theory, even if I try my best to follow the context word by word, I sometimes still feel "strained." Saying this, I dare not have the slightest disrespect for the translator of that book. For example, when I recently finished reading the article "Plekhanov's Criticism" with great "effort" and felt "refreshed," my first thought was: "If someone could adapt this article... its impact would probably be greater, and there would probably be more readers."</p>
<p>I remember Mr. Lu Xun admitting in "On Translation" that there are different levels of readers. I think, based on experience, advanced readers are the translators, intermediate readers are those who can fully understand the translation with effort, and low-level, that is, the majority of readers, are those who cannot understand or have difficulty understanding the translation, but who are hungrily in need of "spiritual food." If this classification is roughly correct, then here, we can see the great significance of "adaptation" work.</p>
<p>Before discussing "how to adapt," we must first admit that adaptation is an extremely difficult task. To adapt a work or theory in a way that is "deep and easy to understand," the first thing is to completely and thoroughly "understand" the content of the original book, and then talk about how to express it simply and accurately in one's own plain language. Honestly speaking, I dare not ask for advice from some of the recent book compilers (not to mention those who copy). Cutting out a certain translated passage and adding "Plekhanov said:" above it, or cutting out a section of a work and adding a few sentences of "concept" above it: "This expresses the consciousness of the petty bourgeoisie," without fully "grasping" the "positiveness of the theme," so-and-so's work "lacks understanding of materialistic dialectics," he must "learn" dialectics, "fight for the method of dialectics"... Such "adaptation" is not only a waste, but simply "lazy." In technical terms, it only proves that this person has "no understanding" and "no digestion" of the original theory. Even if an "author" wants to prostrate himself, he cannot accept this critic's "advice." "Learn," yes, how to learn? Honestly speaking, "learning" from someone who himself has "no understanding" and cannot "inspire respect" is really a bit "cannot help but speak out." It seems that that tone and that manner are also a bit difficult to "convince" people.</p>
<p>I've digressed; let's get back on track. Finally, I hope that adapters with this kind of "conceptual" and "preachy" approach will not continue to "develop" their faults, although I dare not "emphasize" their "learning." If, during these difficult years, more popular versions of works and theories that have been painstakingly adapted can appear, I will be their loyal reader and supporter.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Buzzing Sounds <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Nanjiao</p>
<p>On a sweltering summer night, while listening to friends chatting, the buzzing of mosquitoes disturbs the surroundings, making one feel depressed and feel that these days are not going well.</p>
<p>To extend this feeling, although there are few disturbances from the buzzing of mosquitoes during the day, when one occasionally takes a moment to open the newspaper, where is there not some buzzing sound that makes one feel uncomfortable after reading it?</p>
<p>Starting from the world, the World Economic Conference is ringing the death knell amidst this buzzing sound. Originally, the words of diplomats and politicians were so loud, but when they gathered together, they were like the buzzing of mosquitoes. Just look at from the Washington Conference to this World Economic Conference, has there ever been a time when a sentence was said that made the world feel happy?</p>
<p>Looking back at the situation in China, this country is even more pitiful. The warlords armed millions of homeless people without clothes or food, aiming at each other, but none fired the first shot; the bureaucrats sharpened their heads to earn people's wealth, silently embracing women or opium pipes to live their days.</p>
<p>Then there are the urban monks buried in the cities, who have all kinds of tragic events of fighting for love and jealousy, and hacking and shooting every day; in another corner, the victims of disasters are selling their wives and children and eating raw meat and blood, reflecting how obvious the contradictory phenomena of this social life, this dying period of capitalism, are, and how uncomfortable this state of neither life nor death is!</p>
<p>In the contradictory social life of the dying period of capitalism, the war drums for justice were silent for a while, and the buzzing sounds and the蝇营狗苟活响 everywhere. People who felt uncomfortable in life also abandoned social justice, sought stimulation, and went astray; the darkness in the political arena and the fraud in the market stirred up people throughout the whole society, making a never-ending commotion. This is a dark picture covered by buzzing sounds.</p>

<p>(1) The continued manuscript of "Ordinary Things" has not arrived, so it will be suspended for one day.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, over thirty sources of supply arrived. Both retail and wholesale demand remained good. Although the situation was slightly tight, the market remained stable. Prices for thick glutinous rice such as Changbang Su, Tongbang Nangang, and thin rice such as Qingjiao Songjiang continued to rise for higher grades. Medium and lower grades remained unchanged. Duyang Jian rice, due to a shortage of goods, showed a slight increase. Ordinary rice remained flat and weak. The overall market for Northern Jiangsu packaged rice remained just over a thousand packages. Prices for factory-fresh Dongxin glutinous rice turned soft again, with prices reduced by two cents. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, approximately twenty sources of supply arrived from various routes in the lower reaches of the river. Demand for white glutinous rice remained strong, and the market price was stable. Medium and lower grades remained weak. Thin rice arrivals were small and sales were flat, with prices showing a slightly soft trend. Early rice also showed a weak trend. Dujian rice prices dropped slightly by one cent. Although the amount of Yangbu Jian rice arriving was not large, demand was sluggish and prices continued to decline. White Yuan rice was stable. Shipments of Dongxin glutinous rice increased, causing prices to drop by two cents.</p>
<h3 id="e270">Passenger Xiang Rice Sales Active in Zhejiang <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's passenger Xiang rice market saw very good demand in the Wen, Tai, and Ning routes of Zhejiang Province going north. Tianjin continued to inquire about machine-processed red rice. Local merchants inquired about foreign rice, and the market was quite active. There was hope for further gains in the future. However, the stock of passenger Xiang rice was gradually diminishing, and there were no high-quality goods available, making it difficult to match prices at the end. There was very little transportation. With both stock and arrivals low, even if passenger merchants had demand, it would not be possible to procure goods. However, various early rice varieties were coming onto the market, and rice prices at the production areas were also low. In the future, there might be some opportunities for coordination and application. Yesterday, the market was active, but prices were stable. Ningbo purchased 270 packages of Jiangxi machine-processed late rice at 7 yuan 2 jiao 1 fen per package, 671 packages of Hunan machine-processed oil rice at 7 yuan 2 jiao 7 fen per package, and 250 packages from Jing at 6 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen per package. Tianjin merchants purchased 122 packages of machine-processed red rice at 7 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen per package. Wen and Tai merchants purchased 760 packages of Nanjing Xiang rice at 5 yuan 6 jiao 4 fen per package. Wuxi rough Xiang rice was 600 packages at 5 yuan 4 jiao 5 fen per package, and machine Xiang rice was 500 packages at 6 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen per package, and one week of rough Xiang rice at 5 yuan 3 jiao 7 fen. Local merchants purchased 400 packages of Saigon No. 1 rice at 8 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday was the delivery day for July futures flour. It was reported that the delivery volume for July was over 500,000 packages.

Only Fuxin received 104,000 packages from the warship, China Green Samsung 22,000 packages, Huafeng Green Wheat Root 1,000 packages, and Xinda Green Cannon 3,000 packages. On the receiving side, hedging still accounted for the majority. Local merchants only received a few thousand packages.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a total of over one hundred packages of new green mung beans arrived from Shashi, and over two hundred and twenty packages from Hunan. During this time of sluggish demand, Shashi's bright, mixed-quality green mung beans were difficult to sell. Only Hunan's full-quality green mung beans were fortunate to have a route to Xiamen, but the market price was down two cents from the previous first round of sales, with a price of five yuan, selling ninety packages. A price of four yuan nine jiao was offered for over one hundred packages.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw firm increases in margin calls and a slight contraction in the Dutch exchange rate, leading to a tight and bullish trend. The association traded ordinary grade 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 20 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen, up five cents from the previous day.

Zhenxing's own factory opened for sale 100 packages of crystal flower green sugar at 16 yuan 5 jiao 5 fen, up about one jiao from the previous day. Jian merchants opened for sale Five Blessings white crystal sugar at 17 yuan 2 jiao per unit, and the inventory was sold out. The next batch is expected to arrive soon.</p>

<p>New peanut seeds initially saw a promising harvest, with the highest price for the first batch of goods at only about twenty-eight yuan. According to reports from Zhangzhou, the harvest was greatly reduced due to damage from wind and rain along the way, with a total of no more than four hundred dan. Therefore, only a few dozen pieces arrived yesterday. If the quality of the goods is high, there should be good prospects.</p>

<p>Recent tinplate transactions have not seen much progress. Factories have stopped production, and merchants have little demand, causing the market to be almost at a standstill. Arrivals are frequent, and inventories are quite high, causing widespread panic. Buyers are increasingly offering low prices to secure deals. Therefore, the trend is very different from last spring. Current market prices are: 90-pound British goods are offered at 16 yuan 6 jiao, 100-pound at 17 yuan 5 jiao, double-linked 90-pound at 33 yuan, 100-pound at 36 yuan, 90-pound American goods are offered at 18 yuan, 100-pound at 19 yuan 5 jiao, double-linked 90-pound at 36 yuan 5 jiao, 100-pound at 40 yuan, Huitong Sitie Old Steel Factory at 34 yuan, New Steel Factory at 32 yuan 5 jiao, and wild chicken goods at 32 yuan.

<h3 id="e278">A Glimpse of Seafood Production Areas by Cao Wenhai <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>Our country has thousands of miles of coastline, encompassing cold, temperate, and tropical zones. Yet, we still rely heavily on imports for seafood, incurring significant annual losses. This is alarming. The low production is due to poor fishing practices. Fishermen lack knowledge and adhere to outdated methods, making them unable to compete with scientific advancements. The quantity of catches and the distance of voyages are not properly calculated, making their inefficiency clear. Furthermore, while other countries have organized and well-funded fishing fleets, our investors are unwilling to invest, and those who could organize are unwilling to do so. Coastal areas are plagued by banditry, robbery, and kidnapping. The government fails to protect, and the people fail to advance. How can we avoid being outcompeted by foreign fishermen? The variety of seafood is vast. What I will discuss here is a general overview of their production areas.</p>
<p>(1) Shark fins are produced in Fujian, China, and abroad in Japan and the islands of Southeast Asia. (2) Sea cucumbers are produced in Vladivostok, Japan, and the islands of Southeast Asia. (3) Dried scallops are produced in Yantai, China, and abroad in Japan. (4) Abalone is mostly from Japan, followed by the United States. Guangdong, China, has a small production. (5) Squid is produced in Guangdong, Fujian, and coastal provinces. Foreign countries such as Japan, the United States, and Russia also produce large quantities. (6) Dried shrimp is produced in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Yantai, but imports from Japan and the islands of Southeast Asia are more common. (7) Shrimp roe is produced in Jiangbei, Jiangsu Province, with little production elsewhere. (8) Mussels from Ningbo, Zhejiang Province, are of good quality, but the market is dominated by Japanese goods. (9) Laver seaweed is produced in Ningbo, Zhejiang, but Japanese imports dominate the market. (10) Tribute dried goods are produced in Ningbo and Yantai, China. (11) Cuttlefish are unique to China and produced in Ningbo and Yantai. (12) Fish skin is produced in Xiamen, Fujian, and in Japan and the islands of Southeast Asia. (13) Fish maw is produced in Ningbo and Yantai, China, and in San Francisco and the islands of Southeast Asia. (14) Cuttlefish (dried cuttlefish) is produced in Daishan, Zhoushan, Shengsi, Sijiao, Liuheng in Zhejiang Province, and in Yantai in Shandong Province, and Liansi in Jiangsu Province. The annual production volume ranges from 20,000 to 30,000 dan, with a minimum of 10,000 dan. The main sales regions are Sichuan, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Fujian. Local demand in Shanghai is limited. The largest production comes from Yantai in Shandong Province. Japan is the only other country that produces this product. (15) Kelp is only produced in Japan and Russia. (16) Sea swallows are produced in Ningbo and Wenzhou, as well as in Japan. (17) Clam dried goods are produced in Yantai, Shandong, and in Japan. (18) Jellyfish skin is unique to China and produced in Ningbo and Fujian. (19) Red algae is only produced in Japan. (20) Seaweed is only produced in the islands of Southeast Asia.</p>

<h3 id="e279">Eyes Open, Mouth Closed <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>"Eyes Open, Mouth Closed" is a thoroughly authentic colloquial expression, unlike "Eyes Open and Closed," which doesn't quite fit as a common saying. Don't underestimate it; though only four characters, it holds numerous clever strategies, worthy of being tucked away in Zhuge Liang's or Qing Tian's brocade pouch. It's a secret to navigating the world, a subtle method for dealing with people, and can be considered a "golden rule" or "inviolable principle." See the annotation below:</p>
<p>A renowned British headmaster, recently deceased, once imparted this wisdom to his students: "If you wish to enjoy the pleasures of life, then your eyes must be wide open, and your mouth must be tightly shut." Now, following the ancient practice of shortening phrases, we condense it to "Eyes Open, Mouth Closed." "Eyes Open" or "Your eyes must be wide open" doesn't mean using them to fend off beggars or confront extortionists; it means using them to discern people, recognize things, and observe expressions. Evidence follows:</p>
<p>A British expatriate living in Italy adhered to the first half of this esteemed headmaster's instruction, leading to a valuable invention. During a holiday, he and a few friends went hiking in the mountains, an area known for its marble. As he wandered through the mountains, his eyes wide open, he carefully observed his surroundings. His gaze happened to fall on a small patch of rock that appeared to be a pale red color. He approached, picked up the stone, and examined it closely, scrutinizing it repeatedly. The more he looked, the more he admired it, delighting him so much that he began to dance with joy, leaving his friends utterly bewildered. What he held was a piece of exceptionally beautiful, pale red marble. As a result, he opened a quarry there, exclusively mining this rare marble, yielding a substantial quantity.</p>
<p>As for the esteemed headmaster's second half of the instruction, it isn't entirely novel. Our ancestors had already articulated similar maxims. While the wording may not be groundbreaking, the meaning is profoundly insightful. "Your mouth must be tightly shut" certainly doesn't mean clamping your lips, clenching your teeth, refusing to eat or drink, and becoming a "mute monkey." It undoubtedly teaches the importance of "speaking cautiously" and aligns with the idea of "eating more and talking less." In these chaotic times, when right and wrong are blurred, speaking carelessly could land you in a terrifying situation. Therefore, it is crucial to keep your mouth tightly shut.</p>
<p>In closing, here are four nonsensical, incongruous, and modern verses: Eyes wide open, never fear being unprosperous in this life; mouth tightly shut, no need for life insurance!</p>
<h3 id="e280">Wives and Sons <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>"Other people's wives are better, one's own sons are better." If this isn't entirely wrong, then, aren't we Chinese, with our eyes fixed solely on the "foreign" word, destined to be cursed with only "better wives" and "better sons" from other people?</p>
<p>"Mountain songs" and "folk tunes"—don't we Chinese have "Five Watches Tune," "Eighteen Touches," "Little Nun," and other widely circulated melodies? More fashionable ones like "Drizzling Rain" and "Three Butterflies," or even more "suitable for refined ears" ones like "Tears on the Barren Mountain" and "Crying for My Wife"? Some are "vulgar without being offensive," others "sorrowful without resentment"—how wonderful! But alas, "Dearest," "Darling," are said to be no match for the Western classic "I Love You."</p>
<p>Even in music, the "erhu" is for fortune-telling and storytelling, the "huqin" is what beggars play for money, and "sheng, xiao, guan, and di" flutes are only for sending off monks, spirits, and conducting rituals. So, even though it's a tune for the "dressing table" or "mourning the dead," when played with Western drums and trumpets, everyone finds it "meaningful." Holding a "violin" case, even if it's empty, is considered "modern" and commands respect. When it comes to food and drink, foreign things are even better. Even if it's meat from the same pig, if it's cooked into "four happiness meatballs" or "steamed pork with rice flour," it feels pointless. But if it's cooked half-raw and placed on a "plate"—aha! "Pork chops, foreigners eat that." Similarly, "wine" brewed from wheat with a high "alcohol" content—"brandy," "beer," "cocktail"—is so noble! "Yuanliang" and "gaoliang" spirits are only for rickshaw pullers and Russian beggars to drink. As for "wheat spirits," it's impossible not to add the word "stinky."</p>
<p>In conversation, one simply must sprinkle in a few phrases of "pidgin English"; in writing, one must sprinkle in a few unnecessary English words. This demonstrates the "speaker's" or "writer's" level of sophistication, proving they've at least nibbled on the "edge of bread" and are worthy of being called a "high-class Chinese." If one can replace the "robe and gown" with "foreign clothes," that's even more of a "thumbs up."</p>
<p>In short, everything is "better from other people," nothing is "better from oneself." As long as the "wife" doesn't have a "son," that's truly terrible.</p>
<h3 id="e281">Memories <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>Though my head was covered with a bamboo hat, my torso and waist were draped in a short shirt and shorts made of rough cloth, my skin, unaccustomed to hardship, ultimately couldn't withstand the relentless, penetrating sunlight and began to peel.</p>
<p>Though my bare feet weren't submerged in the three or four inches of mud, the parts above—knees, calves, shins, and fibulas—were constantly kissed by the scorching sun. My fair skin gradually transformed into a coarse yellow.</p>
<p>Though I knew that my entire hide would soon become as impervious to the sun as Old Wang's rough skin, resembling black cowhide, the heat and stinging sensation was almost unbearable for this child who had just left school and was now practicing in the fields. Moreover, the sharp awns of the rice plants, symbolizing swords, continuously slashed at my shins and fibulas.</p>
<p>The sun was so intense, the sky so clear, that this weather persisted for almost half a month. The soil gradually hardened from being waterlogged. The rice seedlings in the fields turned from lush green to withered yellow. Naturally, I had to follow my eldest, second, and third elder brothers, driving the dragon bone waterwheel day and night, constantly sucking up small amounts of clear water from the distant streams or springs and laboriously leading it to our own cultivated fields to irrigate the soil and save the wilting rice seedlings.</p>
<p>The water in the springs and streams wasn't inexhaustible. Once they dried up, we had to wait for them to slowly refill. Sometimes, when everything else in the world was asleep, we would sit or lie by the stream, pond, or field path, waiting for water.</p>
<p>When the rice was harvested, dried, and winnowed, the landlords would unceremoniously take away most of what we had harvested, leaving us with only enough to sustain us for two months. "Warm in winter, yet children cry from cold; abundant harvest, yet wives weep from hunger"—this wasn't unusual for us tenant farmers.</p>
<p>Though I am now living a wandering life, I shudder to recall the time I had to suspend my studies and farm at home. I dare not echo the high-sounding rhetoric of writers sitting in tall buildings with electric fans, advocating "going to the countryside," because the countryside is deteriorating year after year, something they in Shanghai, the Paris of the East, cannot imagine!</p>

<p>Qingdao Seaside</p>
<p>A road of poetic and artistic scenery stretches,</p>
<p>Silk whips, hat shadows, and carriages fragrant.</p>
<p>The waves care not for human affairs,</p>
<p>But busily carry guests away, surging and flowing.</p>
<p>The domineering aura of Jiaodong is silently extinguished,</p>
<p>Heroes washed away by the waves.</p>
<p>Heaven leaves behind the picturesque青山,</p>
<p>Forever accompanying the poet in solitude.</p>
<p>Visiting Laoshan</p>
<p>A giant rock blocks the sky, seemingly a dead end,</p>
<p>A path reappears where the spring flow is interrupted.</p>
<p>The mountain peaks seem to smile and compete to greet guests,</p>
<p>I love the 青山 and cannot bear to leave.</p>
<p>The rugged and treacherous path is hard to walk,</p>
<p>The nine wonders of the water are all clear.</p>
<p>I want to move my home to live in the valley,</p>
<p>Morning and evening, washing my ears and listening to the sound of the springs.</p>
<p>Night at a Seaside Residence</p>
<p>Jagged rocks clash with the tide daily,</p>
<p>Seemingly crying out against injustice.</p>
<p>The angry waves fill the sky and silence everything,</p>
<p>The heavenly wind roars like a dragon every night.</p>
<p>Morning at a Seaside Residence</p>
<p>After the snow, the sky opens up clear blue,</p>
<p>Sails and masts bring the dawn brightness.</p>
<p>Ten thousand mountains have just emerged from their bath,</p>

<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 12</p>
<p>A Poor Man Joins the Army, A Sick Man Falls Behind, A Sacrifice Willingly Discharged, A Tenderhearted Soldier Makes a Promise. It was probably about two hours before Jiang returned. Gui then complained, "You're not seventy or eighty years old, why does talking to you go on and on without end?" Jiang said, "It's not that I like to talk, but listening to what he said, it's so pitiful, so we just kept talking. Usually, when we see soldiers, we're already unhappy in our hearts. But according to the soldiers themselves, their plight is simply inhuman. In the future, when you see soldiers, you should pity them more." Gui Zhi said, "You're talking in such a roundabout way, what are you talking about anyway? I don't understand." Jiang thought for a while and smiled, saying, "I have a bellyful of things to say, I can't hold it in, so I said it as soon as I saw you. Guess what?" Alas! Before she had said what was on her mind, she sighed in such a pathetic way. Gui Zhi knew that her mother was a softhearted person, so it must have been that person who said some bitter things, which aroused her mother's compassion. If she just kept asking her mother, the story would definitely be even longer, so she lowered her head and stopped talking to her mother. That evening, Jiang went to the back courtyard again to see the sick man, and also found a pair of old cotton socks in the box and gave them to Sheng Shimin, because they were men's socks and were just lying in the box unused. Today, they ran into the Zhao family cooking mutton dumplings, and they insisted that Jiang eat there, and also called Gui Zhi to go. Sheng Shimin had rested in the warm room for half a day, and his spirits were much better. Soldiers don't get to see meat once a month, and when they saw dumplings, their mouths watered. Zhao also let him half-lie and half-sit on the rattan chair and eat two bowls of dumplings. After he had filled his stomach, his illness was even more reduced. Having nothing to do, he talked to everyone about the hardships of the army. After he had talked for two or three hours, not only did he talk about how Jiang and her daughter felt sorry for the soldiers, but also Zhao's idea of letting his son join the army to protect the country became somewhat cold.

The old woman replied, "If God allows, next year's birthday will be the 116th anniversary." Her name is Heihua Kovez. She has been widowed four times in her life. Although she is old, her spirit is still strong, and she can walk on her own.</p>
<p>American savings banks are now allowing people to deposit money using fingerprints instead of signatures. This is to prevent forged signatures. A twenty-pound piece of quartz fell on a miner's head while he was mining in California. In retaliation, he broke the stone with a hammer. To his surprise, there was a layer of pure gold on the surface worth 700 pounds.</p>
<p>A farmer in Sofia was very worried when his cow fell ill. One night, he heard a sound that he thought was the cow moaning, wanting something. He got up quickly, but soon after he left the bed, the cow was robbed by the guerrillas in gunfire.</p>
