<p>日昨中宣會招待首都報。界内政部科長余明長亦被邀作。陪竟于席上公然肆其詆毁。謂中國新聞記者專以營利要挾爲目的。不配侈談言論自由。因是引起多數記者之憤慨。而有請求内部罷斥余某之舉。吾人以客觀的態度。作平允之討論。覺其事絶非單純性質可比。實應分析兩點言。之第一。爲賓主間禮貌上之闗。係第二爲全體記者與余長明個人之闗係。</p>
<p>第一點因爾日之會。爲出于中宣會之鄭重召。集則應柬蒞臨者。固皆中宣會座上之嘉賓也。乃于酬酢之頃。突來叱責之。聲寗不楞人視。瞻駭人聽。聞在來賓無端遭受侮辱。固宜不勝其懟恚。在主人亦有所不。安而至引疚道歉。余之不識禮貌爲何如也。且其人旣身居吏職。應識大體。乃于招待新聞記者之席上。而發侮辱新聞記者之言詞。其慒憒舛謬。自不待論。若以嚴格言之。則余某於當庭失態而外。且充分掬示其立場認識之不足。與夫理解能力之低微。更由此而推知其平日辦事之不能無　頇。應付之難免乎操切。故在主管方面。果欲明其糾察之嚴。應課兩重之罰。蓋就當日失儀之責任言。固以記過爲巳足。就平素才識之衡量。言詎宜以記過爲止境。然此爲政府之内部問題。要無煩吾人之借箸矣。</p>
<p>第二點爲全體記者與余明長個人之闗係。曷言乎個人。余明長之有此言。不問其發于何時。發于何地。不問其身分何如。立塲何如。要之有此一言出于其口。即應由其個人負責是也。曷言乎全體。全體云者。不限于爾日在塲之記者。亦不限于首都一地之報界。凡爲國人而操新聞業者。胥應領略此一言之敎訓也。余某謂中國新聞記者專以營利要挾爲目的。其爲出于籠統之誣衊。固已章章明甚。惟吾人雅不願爲法理之執著。亦不欲爲無謂之糾纒。今且撇開一切不問。而祗以明白簡單之兩語。舉以質諸余某。即余某所發之言論。爲有所實指歟。爲無的放矢歟。信有所實指也。則應明白舉出其人。使吾新聞界知有此敗類。而與衆共棄之。若爲無的放矢。則亦當于書面引咎之餘。加以委婉詳盡之詮釋。以消泯社會人士因彼一言而引起之疑翳。蓋報紙爲社會之讀物。而新聞記者爲主持報紙之中心。新聞記者固應求充分之知識與才具新聞記者尤須有健全之人格與操守。其所負之使命旣大。其所取之步調彌艱。其行動旣足以移轉社會之視聽。其影響亦常能左右習俗之變遷。新聞記者若不受社會之尊重。即報紙失其誘導之效能。故吾人平日于硜硜自守之中。唯恐蜚言之横相加遺。個人毁譽之得失猶小。社會觀聽之闗聯實大。此吾人所以對于余某之言。不能默爾而息也。</p>

<p>（但倘使一國旣已爲人所征服、復欲以此種辯論、永久使居于被征服者之地位、則余應明白聲明、德國决不能忍受此種待遇若各國旣有强盛之軍備艦隊飛機隊等、猛欲以傲慢之態度、欺凌已經解除武裝及剥奪自衛能力之德國、爲各國計、亦非良策也、故今後惟有于二者之中、擇一途徑而行、一爲各國均等减軍之實現、一則爲軍縮問題之完全瓦解是也、）</p>

<p>首由主席社會局代表吳桓如報告、吳氏略謂、今天爲上海市九個機闗所發起的土布運動大會開幕之期、我们發起此會、有甚重大之意義、尤其在上海這個地方、我们更要提倡土布爲什麽呢、因爲好闊綽好奢華好撑塲面的上海社會、把都市的劣點、暴露凈盡了、我们要使上海市民覺悟中國的農村經濟破產、全國經濟巳陷於極危險的時期、再要崇洋貨而鄙土布、中國只有立向毁滅的路上走去如何來補救呢、自然只有提倡中國農村裹自己所出產的土貨了、土貨　中、以土布爲最要、但是土布業的前途發展如何、全視吾國人民自己肯用不肯用、欲使土布業發達、依個人的管見所及、其擴展銷路的方法、約有三端、（一）土布商應有奮鬥的决心、農家所生產的土布、雖然品質堅牢、價值便宜、但是和不經用　洋布相比較、質地不及他的细、顔色不及他的美、並且他的價值、也很便宜、一般購用的人们、祇顧到目前的美觀、就舍土布而用洋貨了、我们的土布商店、應具有奮鬥的决心、不惜任何犠牲、去同洋布業對抗、勸導一般顧客試用、使他们漸漸地知道土布的好處、銷路就可以慢慢推廣了、（二）土布業者、力求土布的改良、土布的質地、不及洋布的細緻、花色不及洋布的合時、已如前述、所以我们要想推廣銷路、非在這兩點設法改良不可、土布業者、應當聯合起來、聘請有學識有經騐的技師、指導監督、以求發展、例如鐵機的改良、門面的加闊、用途的推廣、在在應予以深切之研究、方可有濟、（三）政府的提倡奬勵、土布業旣爲農家唯一的副業、在此農村經濟破產的時候、政府對之、　當竭力提倡奬勵、以求其發展、其辦法、一、令飭各所屬機闗學校職員學生、所用制服、儘先購用優良土布、以樹模範、二設土布奬勵金、制定奬（龔叔賢攝）</p>
<p>勵規則、以資鼓勵、此外如土布展覽會之贊助、及其他宣傳方面、與以便利等、均需要政府的恊助、總布言之、土布業要求發展、需要政府土布商和土布製造者之共同努力、</p>

<p>草地網球會之羅泊杯國際雙打錦標、中華亦自一九三零年起、來勝三年矣、且歷年决賽、法商總會球場上之觀衆、必滿坑滿谷、擁擠非凡、惟今年之景况、遠非昔比、寥寥二三百人、備覺蕭條、察其原因、實由於中華之對手英國兩選手史篤克與柯爾巧、均非上流之材、加以中華起用老衰之江道章與邱飛海搭配、不足以號召也、且觀乎中日複賽、中華以五盤劇戰始淘汰日本、以爲與曾勝美國史規亞史密斯之英國組史柯二人决賽、必凶多吉少、但交綏之下、英選手精神淹没、處處造成不可原諒之錯誤、使邱江連取三盤、十分容易、此非始料所及者、然表則平淡無味、興趣索然、</p>

<p>英選手失誤頻逞、邱江得一而再、連取六局、容易非凡、各局分數（Ｐoints）之總比爲二十六比十一、第二盤中華以滑四失邱之發球局、繼以滑四奪回柯爾巧之發球局、再取第三局成二比一、英選手稍露鋒芒、施以高壓、連得兩局、二比三　花一現、佔居上風、往後中華一氣呵成四局成六比三終、分數爲三十一比二十五、第三盤上、第二局及第八局、戰情頗見緊張、成平手者多次、且第八局上成六次平等之多、中華先勝兩局、英國還敬兩局、中華以滑四連勝第五六局、英國苦戰又成四比四比手、邱江再加兩局、成六比四結束直落三之一面倒局勢、是盤分數爲四十比三十一、賽畢、由草地網球會會長葛林姆旭給奬而散、</p>

<p>— 楊時</p>
<p>聽說遺物者是上帝，他六天造成世界，以人類爲萬物之鑒，命作地球的主人，把地球佈置得很完美，目的是使得人類生活美滿，無憂無盧，無爭無奪。</p>
<p>六天過了，他張了眼睛看一看：　！這地球有土地，有植物，有水，有火，有礦產。（呵！好了，你们丨人類丨從今可最快活的享受這美滿的賜予了，你们可安逸的作你们的人了，他笑着呌了一聲，而後，第七天，人们便作來紀念他禮拜他，呌做禮拜日週而復始着，他微微地笑，享受道些禮拜。</p>
<p>可是，我们的上帝當時祗張大了眼看一看，却未用他的心細察一會；或許他是急於要享福，六天疲勞之後立刻要謀一番享樂，故他祗張大眼一看，以爲一切都圓滿了，他便休息了。看，現在，這土地，植物，礦產，……人類是在爭奪了，爭奪而鬥爭了，人類流着血，一個一個的死去，這美滿的賜予他们不能享受了，他们不能作他们安逸的人了。</p>
<p>嗟呼上帝！誰敎你那時不仔細一番，以致你所一手造成的世界現在是破壞了無遺，你使命的作地球的主人翁萬物之靈的人，互相殘殺着，殘殺着禮拜你將要無暇了呵！你這時微微地笑着嗎？我想你　定凄慘的在天上痴立着；你爲這世界在傷心着了。但是現在我祇是請求你，你不要無濟於事的痴立着了，你且運一番神通，把世界再改造一會，再費一天精神，來一個禮拜七，那時，人類不流血了，眞正的安逸的做人了，那麽再來禮拜你，虔誠的禮拜你，永遠的贊頌你。</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>上海人大都喜歡着皮鞋，如果經濟可能的話，就是勉强也得着還其西裝：當然，西裝是離不掉皮鞋的。不過也有人喜歡用長袍罩着條西裝褲，這就比較藝術而寫意得多；當然，他们也是離不掉皮鞋的。</p>
<p>皮鞋之於我，除雨天外，可說没有旁的緣份。因爲我的皮鞋是一種比十九世紀的（釘鞋）略爲進步一些的粗坯，輕易不願上脚；我是認爲只有雨天才用得着皮鞋的。</p>
<p>可是我聽說來路貨的皮鞋就經不起雨，雨天照例要套上橡皮鞋的；這豈特僅是滑稽，而且也就夠麻煩啦！是不是？上海人旣富有（皮鞋熱，）而且不是來爲了皮鞋盛行的緣故，就有人把擦皮鞋當做職業。我们知道女性的眼光大都先接觸到男性的脚部，當然，皮鞋是有擦得光而且亮的必要的。所以擦皮鞋的在上海簡直是必不可少，於是此業也就推進得很快。不過以抗日英雄而流落到上海來擦皮鞋，却是一件新鮮而動人的事情！</p>
<p>我们看到江民聲君對本報記者的談話：（抗日英雄到京滬後，率多高樓大厦，豐衣足食，出必汽車，侍從如雲，時而莫干山，時而蘇杭，舉止闊綽，竊爲心痛！）稚的心是早就死了！不覺得痛，而頭却脹得異常厲害。但想到居然還有人能不慕虚榮，不上莫干山，不住洋房，不坐汽車，靠着雙手擦皮鞋度日，我也就興奮起來。我的眼前仿佛還能看到一線微弱的曙光！</p>
<p>上海是一個華洋雜處的所在，我爲江君設想，假使擦到日本人脚上的皮鞋，似乎無庸上得油的，因爲涙水可以洗掉皮鞋上的灰磨，祇要你的手不顫，擦上幾擦，也就完工了丨</p>
<p>上海有年青的英雄在擦皮鞋，遼寗有六十歳的老敎員被逼赤着膊在擦地板。（五日本報遼寗通信幂相映之下，爲之一歎！</p>

<p>— 錢澐作文棟良作畫</p>
<p>里衖不太平，說是妖孽作崇，凡屬活人，都該盡賄鬼工作；於是居然有錢出錢，無錢出力，某姓太太也爲着愛孫福官却病起見，迅速地寫上助洋十元；更奇妙莫測的是某先生因麻雀連日敗北面捐寫二元，生意經做到了鬼身上，滑天下之大稽。</p>
<p>妖　是誰呢。天曉得，死鬼明白，也有人較爽快點說：爲太平公醮直接間接得以維持生計的不知幾許，這還是無形中之義舉，再說中國人大部份除了此等處，肯化錢也决無如此爽的，言盡於此，那末助洋者固然呆子，查根底者更是呆子，似是而非，似非而是。</p>
<p>若說公醮有靈騐的，願爲這社會，這國家，打上三十三天，豈不眞正功德無量。</p>
<p>敎育不普及要使太平公醮之類的事絶跡，休想！</p>
<p>路貨就覺得穿不出去，所以（大英皮）在上海確有相當的誘惑力，而皮鞋業也就</p>

<p>— 烟</p>
<p>中國的交通，可算得最複雜了。並且保守性也非常强烈·除非爲瑕境所迫，不能不落伍，儘是在大都市裹，可以看見幾千年以前的故物，在那裹和科學化的東西並行不廢。像上海的一一輪明月，）他的年紀至少要四千歳以上，黄帝所創製的，或者已經有這個模樣，到現在未必經過多少改進罷。但他居然和電車汽車等最時代的，日新月異歳不同的東西，在坦平地，滑溜地，柏油馬路上並駕齊驅。我们爲什麽不驚奇呢？譬如戴方巾穿海青的，和西裝朋友一起走着，我们見了，怎樣的觀感呢？天下之大，無奇不有，内地交通的因難，更非邵市中人所能夢想得到。我的朋友金侣琴先生，他到長沙去，在益陽地方，瞧見黄包車，有巨大的包篷，把黄包車夫也包括在内，好像古代詩人所形容的油壁香車，倘然落雨，非常實惠，車夫不至成落湯雞，不過覺得臃腫些。</p>
<p>還不算奇，奇事處處有，此處大不同，因着資水没有橋梁，必須擺渡，他们坐的是汽車，當然不能絶馳而過，只得也放在擺渡船上擺過去。我们記得美國什麽地方有火車在船上開駛過河去的，誰知東方古國，也有這相近的玩意。那位金先生說，他坐過上山電車，架空電車，單是汽車過河，還是破題兒第一遭，因此他詩興勃發，來了一首詩道：（益陽山川本清奇，况復香車油幕低；最是耐人尋味處，汽車擺渡過河西。）聽說湖南省還有木炭汽車，酒精汽車，那麽應有盡有的上海，未免對之有愧呢。</p>

<p>第十五回　客去含羞柔情蕩微笑人來訪舊惡信啟愁懷</p>
<p>趙自强看着他那個樣子，也是禁不住心裹一陣奇癢，就對着人家也是一笑。正在這個時候，有一羣人在路上走着，趙自强才省悟過來，不要在人面前露出什麽破綻來了，只得掉轉身就忽忽的走去。桂枝靠了門框站定，望了趙自强的去影，只管呆呆的傻想。一會兒工夫，江氏由裹面走出來了，向他道：喲，我那裹没有把你找個夠，你一個人在大門口站了作什麽。桂枝道：一天到晚，老在屋子裹闗着嗎？我也該出來透透空氣呀！江氏笑道：喲！我们姑娘眞也有個新鮮勁兒，居然會說出來透透空氣。桂枝道：透空氣這句話也很普通呀！這算得了什麽新鮮呢？江氏和姑娘說着話的時候，眼睛可就望着人行路。見那土路上，一路大皮鞋印，正是由自己大門口走了出去的。心裹轉着念頭一想，豈不是趙自强走去，留下來的脚印嗎？自己的姑娘，自己是知道的，雖然不怎樣的頑固，可是像女學生好一樣，出來談戀愛自由，那也辦不到。現在看他和趙自强這一分情形，那就去談戀愛的那句話也差不多了。據現在的時髦人說，經過戀愛而成的夫妻，那是圓滿的婚姻，這樣看起來，將來自己的姑娘姑爺，也是一對圓滿夫妻，自己總是怕姑娘找不着好女婿爲他焦心，如今照大體看起來，就用不着爲姑娘焦心了。娘兒兩個都站在門口，望了向西去的大路，有些發楞。正在這時，他娘兒倆一同贊成的劉家媽，恰是由大門口經過，却笑道：天氣還凉啦，你娘兒倆倒在門口站着。江氏母女都說不出一個所以然來，爲什麽要站在大門口。、一八九）</p>

<p>兒童的樂園　愛國的少年少女</p>
<h3 id="c237">意大利少年 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 楚</p>
<p>意大利首相常常對童子軍說道：一要想國家强盛，全靠你们少年，你们曉得從前有一位少年是　國家而死的。一這少年名呌巴里拉今日意人利全國的童子軍，都是用巴里拉命名，原來意國的童子軍，可分爲幼年團，少年團，少女團，女子青年團等，除搜以皆育，體育，德育外，並有軍事敎育，講演會，山林　單生活，乘車艦赴海外遊歷等，這是意國根本上培植軍國民敎育，確爲各國所不及的。</p>
<p>說到巴里拉Ｂallila這位少年，當六十三年前，奥大利的軍隊，占領了意國的極諾伐Ｇenq</p>
<p>va村莊，武裝的敵兵，横行無忌，那時巴里拉非常慎慨，暗中流涙嘆息。某日，敵兵推了大砲，通過街市，那砲車的輪子，忽然陷入泥中，敵兵的上官，要大街上的人帮助他起出車輪，可是極諾伐村上的人，都恨國土已爲敵軍佔領，不肯出力，敵兵便大駕道：（混蛋的亡國奴，若不服從命令，就要你们的性命。）中有一位軍官，穿了高統的皮鞋，把一個鄉民用脚亂踢，巴里拉正在人叢中，怒火中燒，不能再忍，大聲怒駡那軍官道：（畜生，你這樣强　無禮，我吃了你的肉，也不甘心。）說罷，拿起拳大的石塊，看準軍官的頭，猛力投去，那軍官受了重創，旁邊護衛的兩三兵士，立卽用槍亂射，巴哩拉應聲而倒，但不能起立，仍忍痛大駡軍官而死，於是全村的人，大呌巴里拉的名；（巴里拉，巴里拉；我们定爲你報仇！）四散回家連回家中婦女，拿刀持斧而來，勢如怒濤，奥軍見勢不佳，急棄了砲軍，逃出村外。從這消息傳出後意大利全國國民，都債怨填胸，效巴里拉的愛國紛紛而起，成立救國軍，向奥大利軍反攻，奥軍連戰連敗，不得已，提出講和，至是，素爲奥大利墨國的意大利，遂成爲獨立國了。</p>
<h3 id="c238">日本的少女 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>日俄戰爭的時候，有一位年僅十六歳的名呌　太田明子的少女，伊父親是任排長的，當他出發的前一夜，回　家中，與家人話别，到了第二日，就怱怱的走了。這時朋子心中已有從父同死的决心，可是母親在堂，不敢明說，過了半個月，他父親有信回來，說已率兵到了釜山上陸，不久就要開到前線去作戰，明子看了這信，秘密的出家去了，星夜乘車趕到東三省，假扮了女丐，潛入俄國司令部的附近，凑巧有一位俄國軍官，在營門外巡視，看見這少女容貌美麗，起了歹心，就帶到了營中，這時日本聯合艦隊司令官東鄉隆盛，乘了旗艦三笠到了朝鮮，第二師團兵士已在鎭南浦上陸，明子在營中打聽得消息，秘密將俄國軍中情形報告鴨綠江畔的日本第一軍黑木大將司令部，於是日俄兩軍的最初衝突，得明子的報告，竟大勝俄軍，同時俄國艦隊，妨碍日軍的計畫，亦完全爲明子所漏洩，日軍才得把旅順口封鎖，同時把旅順與遼陽的俄軍截斷，俄軍首尾被脅迫，無心應戰，明子聞日軍已佔優勢，逃出俄營，再把俄軍作戰情形報告日軍，日軍急將第一第二第四三軍連絡一氣，互相呼應，擊破俄軍總司令克羅白得金的大軍，進佔旅順背後的砲台　俄軍到了這時，已無法應付，守將斯德舍爾，向日軍乃木大將乞和了。這是日本打勝俄國的原因。其後明子因在途中患病而死，其父親得其偵探敵情之功，陞爲少將。這種内幕，日本的正史上，都諱莫如深，然而日本的靖國神社中，到現在還供有一位護國女神的神位，而且一般婦女们，也常常談到這故事的。</p>

<h3 id="c269">說態度 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 林微音</p>
<p>對於一件事，人總會有一個態度。比如現在秋來了，有的人會對它表示好感，有的人會對它表示反感，有的人會對它無所感。對它表示好感的人會崇讚它，說它多麽幽美：對它表示反感的人會非難它，說它多麽蕭條：對它無所感的人，什麽都不會對它說，讀它自然地來，又讓它自然地去。對它崇讚是一種態度，對它非難也是一種態度，對它什麽都不說也不可說不是一種態度。</p>
<p>要是你是一個崇讚秋的人，非難秋的人也許會非難你：要是你是認清了你自己的見地的，你不會因那非難便改變了你的崇讚它的態度。Ｖice　uersa。</p>
<p>要是你是一個對於秋無所感的人，也許你會受到崇讚它與非難它的雙方的不滿；要是到那時你對於秋還是感到無所感，你也只有聽着，正如你讓秋自然地來，又讓秋自然地去一樣。</p>
<p>可是要是你是一個聰敏的人，你就可不用這樣呆版，你可圓渾一些：你看到崇讚秋的人多的時候，你也就崇讚它一兩句，少，就趁勢非難它。那樣你便永遠是多數人中的一個，就是你永遠是勝利的</p>
<p>或者你是有你自己的見地的，比如說你是非難秋的，可是你看到崇讚它的人多，你便不肯門顯地這樣承認，因爲肯這樣明顯地承認的决不是聰敏人。可是你看到有人在崇讚秋你總心有所不甘，你總想說幾句非難的話。你知道這話又不能正面說，要旁敲側擊，藉以轉移人家的視線。你便會說，他，那崇讚秋的人，買月餅的錢都没有，怎麽配崇讚秋？在反應來了以後，你又可把話移動一些，說，吃不到月餅是他自己的事，怎麽來尋到你？或者告訴他怎樣才可得到買月餅的錢。</p>
<p>這樣，人家看不清你的態度，終於也許會無法應付，或者不願意再應付，於是你就可看你自己做勝利者了。</p>
<h3 id="c270">愛書狂者之話 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 阿英</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>宋牧仲（筠廊偶筆）又載：李玉衡國瑾，窮到没有錢買書，日取國學經史版，摩挲讀之，手爪盡黑，久而淹貫，爲世名儒。玉衡窮得很，住在廟中，日僅一食。多夜没有火的時候，和兩老僕共披敝裘而坐。像這樣（取版摩挲讀之）的讀書人，眞是難得。</p>
<p>（六）</p>
<p>宋代的錢思公，生長富貴，而只好讀書。他讀書的時間分配，是最有趣味的，據他自己說，是（坐則讀經史，臥則讀小說，上厠則閱小詞，）他什麽時候都不肯釋卷。歐陽永叔所記如此。同記又說，宋公垂在史院，每走厠，必挾書以往，諷誦之聲琅然，聞於遠近。至於永叔自己，則所作文章，都在（三上），所謂（馬上），（枕上），（厠上）也。</p>
<p>（七）</p>
<p>說到歐陽永叔，想到了蘇東坡。幾月前，讀明李日華的（紫桃軒雜綴），有一條闗於東坡抄書的事。（雜綴）說，東坡曾自抄（兩漢書）一部，當抄完的時候，自己高興的了不得，自誇以爲貧兒暴富，東坡對於書籍之高，是於此可以想見了。（雜綴）叙述以後，是發着感慨說；今人買印成書，連屋充棟，竟亦不讀，讀亦不精。書日多而學問日疏，子弟日愚，可歎也。</p>
<p>買書是一件好事，但買而不讀，徒供虫蛀，或留給子孫拍賣，這樣的愛書狂者，是毫無意義的。</p>

<p>— 李萬居</p>
<p>基本英語之荒謬絶倫，我想凡是見過林語堂先生的拿去我臉上的毛）（見本月十日自由談）那一篇文章的人，總多少有些明白，不會再去上當的了。從自由談上所發表的幾篇文章看來，拚命主張基本英語可作國際語用的錢歌川先生，似乎連那用八百五十個字寫成的，似通非通，使人笑痛肚子的奇書Ｃarl　and　Anna，並還不曾看到。錢先生大概祇在日本的什麽刋物上，偶然見着有介紹基本英語的文字，便驚爲創見，居爲奇貨，不暇深究，連忙拿到中國來大吹大擂，滿以爲可以轟動一時，却不料倒成了林語堂先生的幽默的資料，弄巧成拙，眞是何苦！</p>
<p>基本英語之拙劣可笑，不用說了；而錢歌川先生把自己並没有深刻認識的東西，像煞有介事的搬到中國來遺寗青年，其大膽也確是可驚的。這事如果是什麽無知市僧所爲，我们還可不去說他，但旣是一個在日本受過高等敎育的人做出來的事，那自然應當受到比較嚴重的批評。</p>
<p>從學理方面指責錢歌川君及其所擁護的基本英語之無意思，那工作已有權威的英語學者林語堂先生及許多世界語者担任了，我不想再說什麽。我現在所要指出來的是錢先生在十一日自由談上發表的一篇文章裹面的幾句毫無根據的謊語。</p>
<p>錢先生因爲要證明基本英語可作國際語用，便一則曰：（基本英語爲什麽可作國際語用呢？因爲歐美各國，英語是可以通行的，甚至日本都可以，）再則曰：（東西洋都能通用，還不算國際語嗎？一姑不論基本英語和普通英語是截然不同的兩樣東西，聽得懂接吻的人，不見得就聽得懂（拿嘴唇），卽讓一步算是凡懂得英語的人都極頴悟，聽人提到（令眼出水之白根）便知道說的是（葱）。但英語在歐美各國究竟是不是可以通行的呢？英語是不是東西洋都能通用呢？</p>
<p>我没有到過美洲，我不知道英語在美洲的拉丁語系國家是不是和在合衆國及加拿大一樣通行；我没有到過日本，我不知道英語在日本是不是和在上海租界上一樣通行；但歐洲呢，我是去過的，而且在那裹度過將近七年的悠長的歳月，名都僻邑，游踪所及的地方也着實不少，憑着我自己的經騐，我可以肯定的說，除開英國本土外，英語在其他各處是並不通行的。雖然在瑞士那樣游客衆多的地方，英語有時還行得通，但在那種地方通行的並不祇是英語，你如果懂得法語和德語，也可以暢游無阻。其餘吸收旅人最多的處所像巴黎那樣的大都會，英語就全不通行。除非你是幾百萬的大富翁，住得起那些專給達官貴人歇脚的大旅館，那裹面有懂得各種語言的辦事人做你的通　外，像錢先生這樣小布爾喬亞，跑到了這種大都會，如果單祇曉得說英語而不懂得當地的語言，又找不到一個在那裹的中國留學生做招待時，那便不單問路買東西全不方便，連住宿都要發生大問題的。錢先生如果以爲柏林或巴黎的電車買票人，巡捕，商店夥計等等，都像上海的一樣能說幾句洋涇浜，那便大錯而特錯了。並且歐洲人都是非常尊重自己的國語的，尤其是法德等那種對於本國的文化感得非常驕傲的國民，他们就是懂得英語，但看見黄面孔的人到了他们的國度裹，不說他们的話而說英語，他们是很不高興，而要拒絶和你說英語的。這種情形，我想錢先生是做夢也不曾想到的罷？</p>
<p>錢先生要證明英語是（東西洋都能通行），那便應當先到西洋去看了一通再說。歐洲還不曾去遇，却坐在編輯室的　字桌前信口開河，拿着東方殯民地和日本那樣後進國家的情形推論到歐洲的許多文明古國，以爲那些國家的人民也和黄種人一樣以能說英語爲榮，眞是錯誤之至！</p>
<h3 id="c272">新秋雜識 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 旅隼</p>
<p>（秋來了！）</p>
<p>秋眞是來了，晴的白天還好，夜裹穿着洋布衫就覺得凉颼颼。報章上滿是闗於（秋）的大小文章：迎秋，悲秋，哀秋，責秋……等等。爲了趨時，也想這麽的做一點，然而總是做不出。我想，就是想要（悲秋）之類，恐怕也要福氣的，實在令人羨慕得很。</p>
<p>記得幼小時，有父母愛護着我的時候，最有趣的是一點小毛病，大病却生不得，旣痛苦，又危險的。生了小病，懶懶的躺在牀上，有些悲凉，又有些嬌氣，小苦而　甜，實在好像秋的詩境。嗚呼哀哉，自從流落江湖以來，靈感捲逃，連小病也不生了。偶然看看文學家的名文，說是秋花爲之慘容，大海爲之沈默云云，只是愈加感到自己的麻木。我就從來没有見過秋花爲了我在悲哀，忽然變了顔色；只要有風，大海是總在呼嘯的，不管我愛鬧還是愛靜。</p>
<p>某女士告訴我们：（晨是學科學的，但在這一刹那，完全忘掉了他的志趣，存在他腦海中的只也一個盡量地享受自然美景的目的。……）這也是一種福氣。科學我學的很淺，只讀過一本生物學敎科書，但是，牠那些敎訓，花是植物的生殖機闗呀，蟲鳴鳥囀，是在求偶呀之類，就完全忘不掉了。昨夜閒在荒場，聽到蟋蟀在野菊花下鳴呌，覺得好像是美景，詩興勃發，就做了兩句新詩丨野菊的生殖機闗下面，</p>
<p>蟀在弔膀子。</p>
<p>寫出來一看，雖然比粗人们所唱的俚歌要高雅一些，而對於新詩人们的由（煙土披離純）而來的詩，還是（相形見絀）。寫得太科學，太眞實，就不雅了，如果改作舊詩，也許不至於這樣。生殖機闗，用嚴又陵先生譯法，可以謂之（性官）；（弔膀子）呢，我自己就不懂那語源，但據老於上海者說，這是因西洋人的男女挽臂同行而來的，引伸爲誘惑或追求異性的意思。弔者，掛也，亦即相挾持。那麽，我的詩就譯出來丨</p>
<p>野菊性官下，</p>
<p>鳴蛩在懸肘。</p>
<p>雖然很有些費解，但似乎也雅得多，也就是好得多。人们不懂，所以雅，也就是所以好，現在也還是一個做文豪的秘訣呀。質之新詩人邵洵美先生之流，以爲如何？</p>

<p>— 英國約瑟康拉德作侍桁譯</p>
<p>他停住了講話，耳朶對着門口靜聽了一會，　後摇摇頭又繼續講下去。</p>
<p>（我的哥哥想大呌一聲對他们挑戰丨只呌一聲丨好使那些人们曉得，我们是自由生長的海盜，完全靠着我们的武器和那巨大的海。可是我以我们的愛請求他不要響。我不是正在聽見她在我身邊的喘息的麽？而且我知道，他就是不呌，他们馬上也會追來的。我的哥哥眞愛我。他毫不激起水聲地摇着漿。他只是說，（現在你只剩了半個人丨那另外的一半是在那個婦人的身上了。我可以等候着。當你再變成一個整個的人的時候，你將會同着我再到這裹來挑戰。我们是一個母親生的兒子呀。）我没有回答他。我的全身的氣力和我全部的精神，是在我把着槳的手裹，因爲我在竭望着同她逃到一塊爲男人的憤怒與女人的嫉妬所不能達到的安全的地方去。我的愛情是那麽火熱，能使我想如果我能夠脫開印枝·米妲的激怒和我们的首領的劍下，這愛情會引領我到一個不知死亡的國度裹去。我们急忙地摇着漿，從牙間喘着氣。漿身深深地浸在平滑的水裹。我们走出河外來；我们飛行在淺瀨間的運河裘。我们繞過了黑海岸；我们繞過了那海水對着土地囁嚅着的砂灘；發光的白砂擦着我的小船閃爍着，船是飛得那般地快。我们都不講話。只有一次我說，（睡吧，黛亞美倫，因爲不久就要你拿出全身的氣力了。）我聽見了她的甜蜜的聲音，但我總没有轉過頭看。太陽昇起來了，我们仍然前進着。從我的面上落下的水，像是從雲彩裹落下的雨一樣。我们在光與熱之間飛跑着。我永不回頭看，但我曉得我的哥哥的眼睛，在我的背後，是凝視着前方的，因爲那隻船筆直地飛像離開了弦的箭一樣。没有人橈船比我哥哥繞得更好了。許多次，我们一起，在那隻小船裹，獲得競賽的勝利。但是我從來没有像這一次那麽用盡了我的氣力，這一次，是我们最後在一起的橈船了。在我们的故鄉，也没有人比我的哥哥更勇敢更强壯的。我分不出氣力來回頭看他，可是在我的背後我時刻都聽見他的呼息聲更高了起來。但他仍是不講話。太陽高高地懸在天上。那黏在我的背上的熱氣像是一團火熖。我的肋骨都要鬆開了。但我還是吸不夠氣息進我的胸裹。於是我覺得我必需用我最後的一口氣呌了，（我们休息一下吧！）（好的！）他回答；他的聲音是堅固的。他是强壯的。他是勇敢的。他不曉得恐怖，也不曉得疲倦……我的哥哥！</p>
<p>一種囁嚅，强壯而柔和，渺茫而微弱，像顫抖的樹葉的，像動蕩的樹枝的囁嚅，穿過了樹林的豐茂的深奥處，穿過了淺湖的平靜的水面，而且那在杭木間的湖水突然激起來衝打着那細薄的木材。一種温煖的微風拂着兩個人的面孔，發着悲哀似的聲調吹過去，這好像是夢之國土的不安的嘆息的短促而發響的氣息。</p>

<p>回頭看看我们自己的情形怎樣呢？簡括的說一句，處處表示出：屈服，妥恊，苟安，善忘與不要臉的事實！在去年（九一八）一周紀念的日子，政府猶不時表示（長期抵抗）的决心，社會與個人則更盡力踴躍資助東北義勇軍，繼續抵制劣貨，雖氣勢之熱烈，己較（一二八）上海停戰恊定之前爲大减，然奮發的精神，固仍覺大有存在者在。但到了這又一周年丨自華北停戰恊定以來丨却是景象大非了丨景象大非了！失地是比上一周紀念日格外增多了！熱河全境與多倫榆開均在太陽旗的招摇之下了，日人在華北的威風與實力更是一天擴大似一天了。在事實上，國難的嚴重，環境的危迫，比較（九一八）當年與去年的一周時期，也不知更要嚴重了若干倍，更加添了多少困難的事實，但是這種更嚴重困難的現狀反使我们政府與人民的態度安閒起來了。凡是過去所大聲疾呼的：抵抗呀，經濟絶交呀，都似乎是有漸漸沉寂而幻滅的趨勢了，政府人員的薪金是恢復到（九一八）以前的原狀了，這也可說是（長期抵抗）與（忍辱負重）的更長更忍的表示嗎？至於我们民衆方面，則以前在東北領導義勇軍的抗日將領有多數是巳被迫的逃入闗内，現在所存在的義軍，亦因接濟的日見缺少，於是不能作大規模的反抗，而一班民衆所僅持有的唯一武器丨抵制劣貨丨也不能堅持的運用。唉！我们撫今追昔，實令人萬分的感到這空前的（九一八）國難紀念，眞是一年不如一年的了！</p>
<p>有人說：（人類的天性善忘，而愚昧低劣的民族則更善忘）。我们中國人雖不爭氣，但如不自承認爲一愚昧低劣）的民族，那我们在今後這國内國外的大難日益嚴重的環境下，應如何發奮覺悟的來打破這粉飾太平的沉寂現狀呢？我们要深切的理解，目前這種種沉寂的現狀，也就是亡國滅種的現狀，如此的一年不如一年的下去，結果就祇有做聽人宰割的亡國奴！</p>
<p>看哪！我们的敵人，是如何的整軍經武，脚踏實地的做準備第二次大戰的工作，我们若果有救亡的志氣，殺敵的决心，則今後無論政府方面或是人民方面，應從（事的實行上）表現給人看，這是我们紀念二周（九一八）紀念的唯一希望。否則，若是僅僅空言長期抵抗，或是玩一些不澈底的抵制劣貨的把戲，那末，不客氣說，這就犯了（出賣民衆），（獻媚敵人）之嫌！</p>

<p>每天，當晨光熹微的時候，我就化了十二個銅板買工兩對（元寳蠟燭）（兩個大餅夾兩條油炸燴），吃過了以後，即向着白蓮涇ＸＸ碼頭出發。船，偉大而壯觀的儎滿外國貨物的總統船，像一座山似的停泊在碼頭的邊沿了。</p>
<p>六點鐘巳經敲過，宋小三子像個排長般的點過名以後，於是（鬼呌你窮！頂硬上！）的咕喱（即小工）生涯又開始了。（文治）（起貨棧）一乘一乘的從船裹的貨艙攪到碼頭上來，一堆一堆的貨物：棉花，麥粉，東洋鹹魚，汽車，飛機……都搬到碼頭上的水門汀上來。我们的伙計，有的用小車，一車一車的推向貨艙裹去，有的用肩膊一担一担的担起，有的兩個人一起也用肩膊抬起，也有的四個人或六個八個人一起推，拉，都是向貨倉裹去。然而，手，不久就被擦傷皮，流血，肩膊也很快的就紅腫，疼痛。然而這些都是小事體。在船的貨艙底裹，在（文治）之下，在巍巍乎摇蕩的跳板上行動着的時候，這是最容易有生命的危險的，但是有誰去顧及呢？像前水船丨世界班ＸＸ總統船到的時候，我们的伙計，小福子從甲板上（不慎）（？）而跌下艙底裹，立即遭了粉身碎骨之禍，唉！他死得眞慘啊！但是又有誰去顧及呢？要求公司方面去撫恤嗎？但他们會這樣的答覆你：（這於我们公司無闗，他的（不慎）恕本公司不能負責。但公司對於他的不幸也非常（可惜）……。）太陽已走到了中央，猛烈的光線　火般的射下來，把我们的背脊曬得像廣東燒豬皮似的。吃中飯了，每人扣四百鈿，四號糙米飯，冬瓜煑豆腐湯，一碟咸蘿蔔，唉！我们（咕喱），下流人，祗配吃這樣的伙食。</p>
<p>下午一黥鐘到了。（文治）轟轟地又響了，任你肩膊如何的紅腫，疼痛，是死也不得休息的，否則小頭腦的拳頭馬上就會送到你的胸口來，甚至要把你一天的工鈿充公（其實是充在小頭腦自己的荷包裹去）。這樣，直到太陽西下，六點鐘的時候，那時貨艙巳像小山似的堆滿貨物了，我们的工作才得算爲一工。於是我们的（老友）小三子就像難民容所的先生们一樣的發給我们一條竹籌，除了扣四白鈿中飯錢以外，還可以到老頭子家裹領得一千兩百鈿。</p>
<p>（不是一塊四角半一工嗎？）我持着竹籌去領過工鈿以後，向着我们的一位伙計問着。他四顧望了一下才回答我：（那裹有這麽好的世界呢？唉！老哥丨從前公司發下來是一塊八角半一工的，現在已减了四角，且由包工頭全部判工，而一判，二判，三判。老哥，不錯呀丨一塊四角半一工，頭判抽了四角</p>

<p>(Beijing) After Zhao Dengyu's troops were stationed in Guyuan, Li Shouxin's bandit troops shifted eastward. Zhao's troops going to Guyuan to suppress bandits had previously been agreed upon by the Japanese Kwantung Army. On the 14th, the Japanese suddenly dispatched aircraft to Zhangjiakou to scatter threatening leaflets. The Pingfang sent personnel to negotiate with the Japanese. Chaisan has telegraphed the Kwantung Army to request a stop. Awaiting the reply before Beijing decides on a response. General speculation suggests that this matter may not be the intention of the Kwantung Army and may be an individual action by Matsumuro, so the situation should not escalate. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Japanese Embassy Chargé d'affaires Yano Makoto, accompanied by Counselor Harada, visited He Chengjun at Jurenhall this morning for half an hour. It is rumored to be about the matter of our troops being stationed in Guyuan and Japanese aircraft scattering leaflets. Yin Tong spoke about Japanese aircraft scattering leaflets in Zhangjiakou. Yesterday, he met with Japanese military attaché Chaisan, who agreed to immediately telegraph the Kwantung Army to stop it. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Zhangjiakou telegram: Ruan Xuanwu telegraphed on the 15th that Kangbao is peaceful. Zhao Dengyu's division and Yu Ling's brigade are stationed in Guyuan awaiting orders and have not advanced. Japanese aircraft did not pass over Zhangjiakou on the 15th and 16th. Zhi Zunhan arrived in Zhangjiakou on the evening of the 15th. Song Zheyuan telegraphed Zhao Dengyu on the 16th, ordering him to temporarily station in Guyuan, delay the advance for now, pay attention to the people's hardships, and protect the local area.

<p>(Beijing) Sun Dianying telegraphed from Baotou to Beijing, reporting that he has dispatched an engineering team from Baotou to inspect the transportation situation in the Ninghe area in preparation for departure. There are no roads for cars between Baotou and Ninghe. Although there is a car road from Baotou to Wuyuan, the Yellow River has overflowed in recent days. The Jin army stationed in Wuyuan is preparing to depart and plans to open the river water. Sun has sent personnel to contact the Jin army stationed in Wuyuan to extend the date of the water release. However, there are many difficulties in marching. The car road is covered with mud in many places for two days and tents cannot be set up. Measures are currently being taken. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Japan Refuses Our Troops to Enter the East; Only Allows Sending More Security Teams to Suppress Bandits; It Is Difficult for All Counties to Restore to the Original State <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beijing) The bandit forces are rampant in various counties of the eastern war zone. It is rumored that the Japanese side has rejected our request to send troops into the war zone and only allows us to send more security teams to suppress bandits. The quota for the security teams that we sent into the war zone was originally set at 9,000 men, and only about 3,000 have arrived so far, which is only one-third of the planned number. The remaining quotas are being actively trained. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) It is reported that the Japanese side has forcibly assigned Yuguan to the puppet state and sent personnel to take over the post and telecommunications bureaus. Although our authorities have not yet received a formal report, it is likely to be true based on the situation there. Our side has specially dispatched representatives to Changchun to negotiate the takeover of Yuguan and various passes of the Great Wall, and they will soon return to Beijing. At that time, the details will be known. However, since the ceasefire, the Japanese side has completely maintained all wartime arrangements in the war zone for three months. Recently, the entire 6th Division of the Japanese Army was ordered to be transferred back and another new division was sent to fill the defense. After the departure of the Suzuki Brigade Commander in Miyun, a man named Yamaji was sent to succeed him. The county magistrates of each county are subject to various constraints under the watchful eyes of the Japanese army. Therefore, if the war zone cannot quickly restore the pre-war peaceful state, it is difficult to expect local security and administration to recover and develop. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Miyun is now sending 120 security team members of the 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the Hebei Provincial Government Security Team, led by Mou Zisan, to Miyun, stationed in the county government. Japanese soldiers stationed in Miyun have been conducting live ammunition shooting demonstrations in recent days, with special guard day and night, and the people are quite uneasy. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) A Japanese military camp stationed in Pingjin sent a military officer, Inokami, and six Japanese soldiers in two cars to Miyun this morning to discuss public affairs with the Japanese troops stationed in Rehe. The Pingjin Public Security Bureau sent two policemen to escort them. (16th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beijing) Regarding the issue of suppressing bandits in Luandong, after the receiving committee had sincere negotiations with the Japanese side, because the Japanese side expressed opposition to sending troops, it was decided to change to transfer security teams. They are now stepping up training. The departure date is undetermined. The handover of the passes of the Great Wall has not yet been agreed upon, and it may be difficult to realize it for a while.

Three Japanese soldiers were killed. The Yokonaga garrison commander heard the news and rushed to the scene with troops at 9:20, but the guerrillas were nowhere to be seen. He immediately ordered the Japanese army to pursue. It was later discovered that 120,000 yuan in cash was robbed, and two passengers were killed. (16th China United News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Insulting Incident of Newspaper Reporters in the Capital <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>The Propaganda Committee recently hosted a gathering of the capital's newspaper reporters. Yu Mingchang, a section chief from the Ministry of Interior, was also invited to attend. However, during the gathering, Yu openly slandered the journalists, claiming that Chinese newspaper reporters were solely motivated by profit and blackmail and were not worthy of talking about freedom of speech. This aroused the anger of many reporters, who requested that the Ministry of Interior dismiss Yu. We, with an objective attitude, offer a fair discussion, feeling that this matter is by no means a simple one and should be analyzed in two points. The first is the relationship of etiquette between host and guest; the second is the relationship between all the reporters and Yu Mingchang personally.</p>
<p>The first point: because the gathering that day was solemnly convened by the Propaganda Committee, those who were invited should all be honored guests at the Propaganda Committee's table. Yet in the midst of the conviviality, a sudden accusation was launched. Isn't that frightening to hear? It is only right that the guests are indignant at being insulted for no reason, and the host is also uneasy and even apologizes. Yu does not know what etiquette is like. Moreover, as a government official, he should be aware of the big picture. Yet at the gathering of newspaper reporters, he uttered words insulting newspaper reporters. His confusion and error need no discussion. Strictly speaking, in addition to his undignified behavior in court, Yu also fully demonstrated his insufficient understanding of his position, his low level of comprehension, and from this, we can deduce that his usual handling of affairs is inevitably clumsy and his response is inevitably reckless. Therefore, the supervisor, if he wants to clearly enforce his discipline, should impose a double penalty. In terms of responsibility for the day's misconduct, a demerit is sufficient. In terms of the usual assessment of talent and knowledge, it should not end with a demerit. However, this is an internal government matter, and we do not need to interfere.</p>
<p>The second point is the relationship between all reporters and Yu Mingchang personally. Why do we say personally? Regardless of when Yu Mingchang said this, regardless of where he said it, regardless of his identity, regardless of his position, in short, since these words came out of his mouth, he should be personally responsible for them. Why do we say all? The term "all" is not limited to the reporters present that day, nor is it limited to the press in the capital. All Chinese people who work in journalism should take this lesson to heart. Yu said that Chinese newspaper reporters are solely motivated by profit and blackmail, which is a blatant slander. However, we do not want to adhere to legalistic arguments, nor do we want to engage in meaningless entanglements. Now, let's put everything aside and simply use two clear and simple questions to question Yu: Are Yu's remarks based on factual evidence or are they unfounded? If there is factual evidence, then he should clearly point out the person, so that our journalism community knows that there is such a degenerate person and discards him with everyone. If it is unfounded, then in addition to a written apology, he should also add a euphemistic and detailed interpretation to dispel the doubts caused by his words among the public. Because newspapers are reading materials for society, and newspaper reporters are the center of managing newspapers. Newspaper reporters should seek full knowledge and talent. Newspaper reporters must have sound character and integrity. The mission they bear is great, and the steps they take are difficult. Their actions are enough to shift the public's attention, and their influence can often influence changes in customs. If newspaper reporters are not respected by society, then newspapers lose their guiding effect. Therefore, in our daily pursuit of self-discipline, we are most afraid of being unjustly slandered. The gain or loss of personal reputation is small, but the connection to social perception is large. This is why we cannot remain silent about Yu's words.</p>
<h3 id="e12">German Foreign Minister Neurath Explains Attitude Towards Disarmament <a href="#e12" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c12" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">12</a></h3>
<p>Germany Is Determined to Maintain Independence and Security and Will Never Tolerate Unequal Treatment in Armaments</p>
<p>There Is No Destructive Attempt Towards Austrian Internal Affairs; It Is Hoped That Other Countries Will Not Interfere Unreasonably</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, German Foreign Minister Neurath gave a very important speech, expounding the new significance of the new German foreign policy. When Neurath spoke about the disarmament issue, he said: "The views of public opinion in various countries seem to be that countries that have already disarmed should first be subject to preliminary management before disarmament is implemented in various countries. It can be seen that the distortions of the views of public opinion circles in various countries have reached an unparalleled point. It is unnecessary to delve into how likely this type of disarmament plan is to be established. Moreover, only other countries talk about war, and no one in the German people has ever dared to dream of armed aggression. Germany today has no other request but to maintain its independent dignity and the security of its territory. Furthermore, if it is said that the reason why Germany needs several years of peace is simply to allow its country and people to achieve their goal of reproduction and recuperation, so that Germany can once again restore its former national strength, and then adopt a strong policy to compete with the world, etc., these are all nonsense in the ideal and have no factual basis."</p>
<p>(But if a country has already been conquered and then wants to use this kind of argument to permanently make it stay in the position of the conquered, then I should clearly state that Germany will never tolerate this kind of treatment. If various countries have strong armaments, fleets, and air forces, and are intent on arrogantly bullying Germany, which has been disarmed and deprived of its ability to defend itself, it is not a good policy for various countries. Therefore, from now on, there is only one path to choose: one is the realization of equal disarmament for various countries, and the other is the complete collapse of the disarmament issue.)</p>
<p>Neurath then discussed the Austro-German incident, saying: "Germans can only be indifferent to the progress of Austria, because the Austrian government treats its German citizens as if they were its own citizens. However, because the Austrian government opposes the National Socialist movement of the German people, the German government sympathizes with Austria. The German government has no intention of interfering in Austria's internal affairs, but other countries cannot interfere without reason in the dispute between Germany and Austria.) Neurath concluded by saying: "The re-establishment of peace and good faith depends on whether the one-sided treaties that have deprived various rights of Germans and other countries that have been exploited by the Treaty of Paris can be abolished, and whether international relations can be rebuilt on the principles of justice, balance, and mutual respect. Therefore, meaningless remarks in various countries now, such as those concerning the so-called Jewish problem, will immediately stop after the facts are clear in the future.)

The outside world interprets this move as Germany will adopt an offensive stance when participating in discussions, especially regarding the issue of ethnic minorities. Since Germany joined the League of Nations, successive representatives, such as the late Foreign Minister Stresemann, former Foreign Minister Curtius, and former Prime Minister Brüning, have invariably raised the issue of ethnic minorities in the League of Nations General Assembly every year and demanded that new protection measures be adopted. At this moment, the German National Socialist Party government has taken excessive actions against the Jewish minority in the country, which has caused a bad impression in world opinion. It is generally believed that Germany will no longer act as a protector of ethnic minorities. However, during the upcoming session of the League of Nations General Assembly, the Hitler government will not abandon the traditional policies of previous German governments, and it is even feared that it will intensify, which is beyond everyone's expectations.

<p>Consistently Protecting the Independence of the Puppet State</p>
<p>Special Attention Is Paid to Relations with China and Russia; Seeks to Promote Coordination with European and American Countries</p>
<p>(Tokyo) New Foreign Minister Hirota today issued the following notice to foreign reporters:</p>
<p>"At a time of fundamental changes in Japan's international position and the general situation of the world, I was appointed to succeed Foreign Minister Uchida because of his unsatisfactory health. The fundamental policy that Japan should adopt has been clearly and unambiguously stated in the imperial edict of March, which is to respect the independence of (Manchukuo), build a foundation within its jurisdiction, and further deepen friendly relations with various countries, and to strengthen world peace and uphold its own duties. Yesterday was the anniversary of the recognition of (Manchukuo). How should this new country contribute to human well-being and universal prosperity? I am convinced that as the world gradually gains a better understanding, external misunderstandings will naturally dissipate. Today, the political and economic interdependence of the world has become more complex, and Japan cannot but maintain the best relations with various countries. Special attention must be paid to the relationship with Japan's three major neighboring countries, namely China, Soviet Russia, and the United States. It is also necessary to conclude an economic agreement with the United Kingdom. This agreement is indispensable to strengthening the traditional friendship between the two empires. The concrete link of Japan's foreign policy is based on a close examination of relations with other countries and should be determined to adapt Japan to its international position and mission." (16th Denstu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) New Foreign Minister Hirota issued a brief statement to the newspapers this afternoon, stating three most important goals, one of which is to advocate economic coordination with Britain, saying that economic coordination with Britain is essential, so that the maintenance of the inherent friendship between the two countries can be stronger. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota replied today to a question from foreign reporters asking whether the Foreign Minister intends to conclude a non-aggression treaty or an arbitration treaty with the United States, saying that he must study the relationship between the two countries to find out whether there is a need to conclude this treaty. However, he believes that the actual situation between the two countries does not make this special move necessary. Hirota continued to speak about the non-aggression treaty with Russia, saying that there should be no conflict between Soviet Russia and its two neighbors, Japan and (Manchukuo), which is a key point. He admitted that there are some outstanding issues between Russia and Japan, but if they are resolved peacefully, there is no need to conclude a non-aggression treaty. However, he personally does not oppose the conclusion of this treaty. Hirota then spoke about the China issue, saying that most of the outstanding issues between China and Japan are caused by the Manchurian Incident. If China has a correct understanding of (Manchukuo) and the current situation, then Sino-Japanese relations will definitely become more friendly. He expressed sympathy for the Chinese leaders, because many of the Chinese leaders are his close friends. He wished them success in their efforts to govern the country. (16th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) After Hirota took office as Foreign Minister of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, he intends to actively break through isolated diplomacy, strive for cooperation with the United States, Britain, and European countries, and seek to resolve various outstanding issues with China and Russia. Hirota himself is fully focused on Russia, and Shigemitsu is focused on China, taking a division of labor and cooperation. It is reported that Hirota will transfer major ambassadors stationed abroad. It is rumored that among the major ambassadors, Hirai stationed in Britain, Nagaoka stationed in France, and Debuchi stationed in the United States will be transferred within the year. Other ambassadors stationed in small countries and counselors of embassies will also be transferred to inject fresh air. Ariyoshi stationed in China will be ordered to return home to report on the diplomatic situation and discuss China policy. According to diplomatic sources, Ariyoshi is scheduled to return home at the end of the month or the beginning of next month. (16th China United Telegram)</p>

<p>Preparing to Connect International Air Routes; Will Negotiate Agreements Separately with Various Countries</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government, in order to control air rights in East Asia, has reportedly ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to prepare to contact various countries for air links and sign separate air agreements, using Fukuoka and Dalian as centers to connect with North China and Russia, using Taiwan as the center to connect with South China, Nanyang, and Australia, and using Sapporo in Hokkaido as the center to connect with the United States, in order to obtain air hegemony in East Asia. (16th China United News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Britain, the United States, Germany, and other countries are striving to expand international air routes with China as the center, which has evolved into a competitive situation. Japan also deems it necessary to establish a fundamental aviation strategy and must urgently seek cooperation between military and civilian aviation. In particular, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, from the standpoint of safeguarding peace in the Orient, believes that it is necessary for Japan's aviation trunk lines to connect with the air routes of various foreign countries and will soon begin negotiations with related countries, namely the six major air trunk lines to Europe, the United States, Australia, China, Manchuria, and Soviet Russia, extending from Fukuoka, Taiwan, Dalian, Rasin, Sapporo, and the Nanyang Islands to connect with foreign international air routes. Separate air agreements will be signed with China, Soviet Russia, the Netherlands, and Australia. New Foreign Minister Hirota has ordered the authorities to prepare. As soon as preparations are completed, negotiations with related countries will begin. (16th Dentu News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Claims that Once the U.S. and Russia Resume Diplomatic Relations, It May Facilitate the Opportunity for War</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a telegram from Ambassador Matsudaira stationed in England to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Morning Post of the 14th carried a communication from a special correspondent in Khabarovsk as follows:</p>
<p>"Soviet Russia is using the coastal region as an operations base. Recently, it has prohibited merchant ships from sailing in the bays near Vladivostok and has issued gag orders to shipbuilding workers, believing it is organizing submarines. Russian officials are also repairing dry docks and building defense works on the border. They are also building airports where aircraft land from time to time, and using the Heilongjiang River and the Ussuri River to transport weapons and military supplies. This fact clearly shows that Soviet Russia has intentions in the Far East. Although the strength of the Red Army in the Far East is unknown, it is certain that it has increased sharply compared to the Sino-Russian War, as seen from the military parade in Khabarovsk and Blagoveshchensk in May. Rumors of a Russo-Japanese War are prevalent in the area. Although there may not be any action between Japan and Russia at the moment, the situation will be determined within the next three months. If the United States recognizes Russia, it may facilitate the opportunity for war." (16th Dentu Telegram)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The aviation team led by French Air Minister Cot has arrived here today and was warmly welcomed by Soviet officials. Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov also personally attended to welcome them. Renowned French aviators Rossi and Codos are expected to fly here from Poland soon. It is reported that the French aviation team's visit is due to the Soviet Union's desire to seek new friends after Hitler's rise to power in Germany and his rejection of communism, and to seek France's assistance in organizing the Soviet Union's civil and military aviation industries. Because France is an ally of the Little Entente, the Franco-Soviet rapprochement will further enhance peace in Eastern Europe. (15th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government gazette, Izvestia, in welcoming the arrival of French Air Minister Cot, expressed the hope that Cot's visit would further promote mutual understanding and trust between France and the Soviet Union, as this understanding and trust is not only related to France and the Soviet Union but also to the promotion of world peace. The newspaper stated that Soviet public opinion is very pleased with Cot's visit, as it will help in the exchange of aviation technology experience between France and the Soviet Union and also enhance the political relations between the two countries based on mutual trust. According to the newspaper's opinion, Daladier is now showing great political foresight, as he has long understood the need to view the Soviet Union as a growing and powerful factor in world peace. The newspaper concluded, (Therefore, we will accept with more sincere willingness Mr. Cot's wish to inspect our country. We firmly believe that the result of mutual research will be mutual understanding and trust.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the national policy of the national defense plan under the new situation, Araki, Takahashi, and Osumi have exchanged opinions and clarified the policies of the army and navy. However, the national defense policy at the national policy level is not a separate proposal by the army and navy but is a comprehensive unification with other related policies (such as the petroleum national policy should also be included, and it is necessary to establish a fundamental national defense plan. Recently, Finance Minister Takahashi, Army Minister Araki, and Navy Minister Osumi are determined to hold fundamental consultations, but this issue does not directly conflict with the financial plan. The discussion is limited to the outline of the national defense plan, and this outline will be attached to the cabinet meeting after the three ministers have decided, and the fundamental policy will be established. It is also heard that the army and navy budgets will be determined based on this policy. According to Finance Minister's words to people about this matter yesterday, he said that he has heard the opinions of the army and navy regarding the national defense plan, but the national policy should be based on the establishment of a complete national defense plan. The policy is to invite Araki and Osumi to exchange opinions in the near future. We are in today's new situation, we should pay attention to national defense, it has been said many times, but even if we recognize this importance, we cannot say that the budget proposed by the army and navy will be fully approved. I sincerely hope that all sectors will not misunderstand this point, which is very fortunate. (16th United Telegram)</p>

<p>Reuters, Washington, 16th. The index of unionized workers in August was the highest in the past two years, and the wage figures for August were also the highest since December 1931. This is a bright prospect in the urgent stage of President Roosevelt's recovery movement. Because of the movement to reduce working hours, 750,000 unemployed people re-entered the industrial sector in August. Labor Secretary Perkins, referring to the importance of this number, warned the public not to be complacent about this, saying that compared with the average number in 1926, the number of employed people is still 28 percent lower, and the difference in wages is even greater. General Johnson claims that the coal industry regulations can be drafted tonight for presidential approval, so the future of the coal industry has seen the light. It is heard that the American President is still abiding by the text of the Recovery Act that allows collective bargaining. Except for special events, no other interpretation of labor provisions is allowed.

<p>Havana, Cuba. The third Cuban revolution has begun. Although the rebel government in Pinar del Río Province claims to have been quelled, according to tonight's news, government troops and new revolutionary troops are still fighting. It is also heard that the new revolutionary army is commanded behind the scenes by former President Menocal and Colonel Mendieta, and Captain Garcia Alan leads the battle. It first broke out in the Consolación del Sur area and has now spread to several provinces. According to reports, Colonel Mendieta fled abroad during the Machado era and lived in New York for a long time. During the first revolution, various factions wanted to support him as the interim president, but for the sake of reaching an agreement between the Machado government and the revolutionaries, Cespedes was promoted instead. Therefore, although Colonel Batista, who commands all government troops, claims that the revolutionary equipment is poor and not a cause for concern, in reality, its momentum cannot be ignored. American Ambassador Welles has reported this situation to Washington. Soon, an American warship sailed from Guantanamo Naval Base (leased by the United States within Cuba) to Santa Cruz del Sur because nine American sugar factory employees there were in a dangerous situation. (15th National Telegram) Havana. American Ambassador Welles admitted tonight that he had reported to Washington that the Cuban situation was becoming increasingly unstable and that riots had occurred in three provinces. It is also heard that although the Cuban government claims that the rebels are not a cause for concern and that American expatriates in various provinces are protected, the people in the American embassy do not believe this. According to the news received here, the armies that have risen up in various provinces are quite radical in nature. The riots in Santa Cruz del Sur in the southern part of Camagüey Province have obvious communist overtones and are particularly opposed to Americans and Spaniards. The Mancanillo area in Oriente Province is actually controlled by agitators. If Cong Zeng attempted to seize sugar factories operated by Americans and ice factories and shoe factories operated by Spaniards, American warships are now anchored not far from Mancanillo. Another warship has been ordered to sail from Guantanamo to Santa Cruz del Sur. If American expatriates voluntarily leave the country, they will be moved to warships. The claim that the new military revolution in Pinar del Río Province has been resolved without bloodshed has also been denied by revolutionary agencies here. It is also heard that wounded soldiers have been transported from the province to Havana by trains and cars, indicating that the government's claim that the rebels surrendered without fighting is not true. According to private news, some government troops have defected and joined the revolutionaries. The two armies are fighting in Consolación del Sur and Quivicán, 100 miles from here. It is also heard that Mendieta and former President Menocal are plotting behind the scenes in the uprising in Pinar del Río Province. The province is closest to the small island where Menocal's party members store weapons. It is heard that they are currently being transported and supplied by small boats. Furthermore, there is a good highway from the province to Havana, which is conducive to marching. Therefore, they chose it as a base for the uprising in order to advance into the capital. At present, within the capital, military defenses have been strengthened, and troops have been added outside the National Hotel, carrying machine guns to surround it. Strangers are not allowed to enter, and the hotel's telephone lines have been cut. Batista has also ordered that if Menocal's party members appear near the hotel, they should be arrested immediately.

<p>(Washington) Although American Secretary of State Hull is determined to avoid intervention in Cuba as much as possible, those with good sources of information here believe that the danger of intervention is imminent. According to reports from American Ambassador Welles, the situation has become increasingly unfavorable in the past 48 hours. Therefore, many have predicted that the frequent disturbances of radical elements on the island and the increase in anti-American sentiment will force the United States to take active action. Currently, the United States has 11 warships besieging the entire island. If military intervention occurs, the American Navy will be able to quickly control the situation after landing.

On the evening of the 2nd of this month, a storm caused a disaster. The dikes collapsed, the thatched houses drifted away, people and animals drowned, and the crops were submerged. The disaster is severe, and words cannot describe it. The fifth district is the most affected. Occasionally, I personally went to the disaster area and found that some fathers and sons could not take care of each other, some mothers and daughters died together, some hugged wood and drowned, fortunately avoiding disaster, some climbed up the roof to escape, but ultimately did not survive. The west village is like this, and the east village is also like this. The south village is the same, and the north village is also like this. Now, there is no shelter to live in, no grain to eat, no complete clothes to wear, no medicine to treat illnesses. Half of the dead are decaying, and the living are waiting for relief. Therefore, I have been planning day and night, purchasing cooked food, and hiring sampans to drive to the disaster area to distribute it separately. Not only do I neglect one thing and lose sight of another, and miss one and hang on to another, but I also have a long heart for relief, but I lack the ability to find money. I am in despair day and night, unable to handle the aftermath. I can only appeal to the authorities and charitable organizations to share the feelings of compatriots and rescue the starving and drowning masses. Allocate huge sums of money, generously resolve righteousness, and treat both the symptoms and the root causes. Provide urgent relief to Ding and Ding, and let the benevolent wind spread and the millet valley be like spring. Remote decrees of virtue are issued, and the disaster-stricken people are saved.

<p>Russia Deploys Large Troops to Defend Along Heilongjiang Province Border; Guerrilla Forces Intercept 200 Japanese Supply Vehicles</p>
<p>The Heilongjiang Province guerrilla forces have recently become active again. A certain gentleman from Heilongjiang Province has recently arrived from Heilongjiang Province through a roundabout route. According to him, the activity of the Heilongjiang Province guerrilla forces and the active war preparations by Japan and Russia in Northern Manchuria are as follows: (Since the September 18th Incident, Japan first occupied Southern Manchuria. In order to manipulate the economy of the Northeast, it coerced the Japanese people in Northern Manchuria and disregarded everything, using its military power to eliminate our guerrilla forces and Soviet Russian influence in Northern Manchuria. However, Soviet Russia has never shown weakness. Although there have been several minor conflicts, there has been no major war. Recently, both Japan and Russia have been actively preparing for war. The Russian side has sent heavy troops to defend along the Heilongjiang Province border, frequently dispatching aircraft to various fortresses in Manchuria to observe the actions of the Japanese puppet troops. At the same time, the Japanese side has also dispatched a large number of troops and deployed them in key locations such as Manzhouli and Heihe in two directions, constructing fortifications in the Nenjiang Beidaling. Both sides are at daggers drawn, and a major war will break out soon. As for the guerrilla forces, since General Ma Zhanshan left Heilongjiang Province, the guerrilla leader Huo Long led his troops to retreat and defend Dongshan, waiting for an opportunity to act. Recently, guerrilla forces have risen in various places, making activity possible. Huo Long then led his troops of more than five thousand people to destroy the construction work of the Japanese puppet government in Tongbei County, more than three hundred miles from Heihe. On the evening of the 2nd of this month, the Japanese army used more than two hundred trucks, fully loaded with supplies and ammunition, to transport them to the county. While passing near Keshan Town, they were ambushed by Huo Long's troops. The two sides fought fiercely for a day and a night. As a result, the Japanese army was unable to withstand the attack and was surrounded by the guerrilla forces, killing more than seventy enemies, capturing more than seventy Arisaka rifles and nine heavy machine guns. Only thirty or so Japanese soldiers escaped, and all the supplies and ammunition were captured by the guerrilla forces. It is also reported that since obtaining this large batch of ammunition and supplies, the number of guerrilla forces has increased to more than eight thousand people, with great momentum. It is planned to attack Heihe along the Qike Road.) (Northeast News Agency)</p>

(2) Military officers and newly appointed personnel of the rank of Major General and below will be subject to examination when summoned, and the examination will be conducted by the Examination Committee of the Third Department of the Xingying. (3) The Xingying examinations are divided into two types: periodic and temporary. (A) Periodic examinations are held for officers of all units of the rank of Major General and below in the spring and autumn of each year. (B) Temporary examinations are held for officers of the rank of Major General and below when summoned by the Chairman or when the unit commander recommends them for promotion or transfer. (4) The principal officers of each unit should also conduct examinations for their subordinates. (A) Each division commander or independent brigade commander should conduct examinations for their subordinates once every quarter. (B) Each regimental commander should conduct examinations for their subordinates once a month. (C) Each battalion commander should conduct examinations for their subordinates once a week.

<p>Situation on the Guangdong-Fujian-Jiangxi Border Eases</p>
<p>A communication from Shantou states that after the Jiangxi bandits occupied Changting and Liancheng in western Fujian, they learned that large forces were gathering on the Guangdong-Fujian border, so they moved all the grain from the bandit areas to Ruijin as much as possible, concentrating their main forces in Jianning and Taining. In the Ting and Lian areas, only miscellaneous Red bandits were left to act as feints to obstruct the pursuit of the Fujian and Guangdong armies. Recently, the Guangdong Army's Huang Renhuan Division received a telegram from Yan Yingyu's Brigade, stationed in Shanghang and Wuping in western Fujian, stating that about a thousand Red bandits from the 1st Regiment of the pseudo-1st Army, with sufficient ammunition and equipment, had fled from Longkeng to Zhaoxin and were digging trenches on Luobaiding. The bandits use pseudo-Farmers and Workers Bank banknotes to buy things. Zeng Youren's Brigade also reported that several days ago, hundreds of pseudo-Farmers and Workers Corps and Peng Yang student bandits fled from Tufang to Nanyang and occupied the Nanyang Baisha area. A unit of the pseudo-Independent 8th Division, about several hundred people, also fled from Huangtan. The bandits originally stationed in Dahe have fled back to Jiangxi, and there are no bandit traces in Dahe. Deng Shizeng, the 19th Route Army's commander in Longyan, telegraphed that there were only about three thousand bandits near Liancheng, most of whom seemed to be fleeing towards Lichuan and Guangchang. There were mixed-color communist bandits (referring to Peng Yang pseudo-student soldiers and pseudo-Farmers and Workers Departments, etc.) numbering over a thousand people in Baisha, Lanjia Ferry, and Nanyang on the border of Shanghang and Yongding. The anti-communist civilian army of Fu Baicui has recovered Miaoqian Zhixi. The Guangdong Army's intelligence relayed from the 19th Route Army's Liu Heding Division in northern Fujian is as follows: There are four or five thousand bandits in Mingxi County, and the pseudo-army is stationed all over the Longhu to Tongling area in northeastern Mingxi, claiming to attack Bailian in Jiangle. The advance troops of about a hundred people have arrived at Shuinan and are shooting across the river at Liu Shangzhi's Brigade. Lu Xingbang's report from Xiamu Huangying states that a thousand bandits who fled from Xiayang are in contact with Huangying. Another unit of Red bandits is moving from Tuwei towards Fukou. Zhou Zhiqun's Brigade reports that the Red bandits of Xiao Jingxian's troops are invading Jiangle County from two routes, Shida. Xiao is leading two thousand people and has arrived in Wan'an. Liu Shangzhi's Brigade Commander reports that a large number of Red bandits have arrived in Chong'an and are preparing to invade Jiangle in Fengpo. There are many refugees fleeing from Fengpo. Lu Xingbang also telegraphed that Red bandits are attacking Yongan in three routes: one route is through Songkou Pingjing Ansha, one route is through Liancheng Xiaotao, and one route is through Mingxi Hudi. Zhu De personally leads the bandits of the Third Company, with five rows of mobile machine guns, and is commanding the pseudo-independent division, regiment, and battalion near Pengkou, Liancheng, to invade northern Fujian. The bandits in Songxi Linshe have all fled to Mingxi.</p>
<p>According to the above information from various sources, the situation in western Fujian has indeed eased. Zhu De entered Mingxi from Pengkou, Liancheng, and advanced towards Yanping. There is a fierce battle near Yanping. It seems that they will flee from northern Fujian to the Zhejiang border, because the bandits in southern Jiangxi are also retreating towards Guangchang. There are only a few Red bandits at Junmenling. The pseudo-independent regiment of three hundred bandits on the ridge attacked Xitou, Wuping, a few days ago but were repelled by the civilian army. This is just the bandits deliberately making a show of strength. (September 9)</p>

<p>The Northern Fujian Bandit Suppression Army Begins General Offensive, Water Traffic Between Yanping and Fuzhou Has Resumed</p>
<p>A communication from Fuzhou states that the northern Fujian Red bandits have been besieging Nanping (i.e. Yanping) and Shaxian without success, and the reinforcements of Tan Qixiu and Mao Weisou's two divisions have arrived in Nansha County. The bandits retreated to Shunchang Jiangle. The Pacification Commissioner has ordered Tan and Mao's two divisions to cooperate with Liu Heding and Lu Xingbang's two units to launch a general offensive against the bandits in Shunjiang from the 11th. Tan and Mao are responsible for the main force battle in the front and rear, and Liu and Lu are responsible for the left and right flanking attacks. Five aircraft were dispatched to bomb them. There are no traces of bandits in Gutian and Youxi Counties below Yanping, and the area is very peaceful. Water traffic from Yanping through Shuikou to Fuzhou has also been fully restored. Since the establishment of the City Defense Command in Fuzhou, troops have been dispatched to dig trenches and set up electric fences in the northwestern suburbs. On the afternoon of the 9th, a joint meeting of party, government, military, and civilian representatives was convened to discuss city defense equipment. It was resolved that the local area would raise 200,000 yuan within two months to build twenty bunkers in the near suburbs surrounding the city. In the first phase, 60,000 yuan would be raised within twenty days to select and build six locations. City defense fundraising, financial maintenance, and ideological guidance committees were immediately organized on the spot to be responsible for handling the matters separately. The food and fire prevention issues are jointly handled by the Public Security Bureau, the County Chamber of Commerce, and the Firefighting Federation. The liaison units in each shop and village in the city and suburbs have been established uniformly and patrol every night. Lights are seen from one house to another, and people's hearts are gradually stabilizing. Those who had moved to Mawei Guantou have returned one after another.</p>
<p>After the Navy's First Fleet, led by Commander Chen Jiliang, arrived in Fujian, they were all stationed in Majiang. Currently, the warships Haichou, Yongji, Yongjian, Jing'an, Haining, and Suining are berthed in Majiang. There are also two Japanese warships and one warship each from Britain, the United States, and France. The Chuqian and Funing are berthed in Taijiang, the Chutai is berthed in Guanjiang, the Haifu is berthed in Nangang, and the Jiangning is berthed in Wulongjiang. (September 11)</p>
<h3 id="e78">He Jian Departs for Pingxiang <a href="#e78" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c78" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">78</a></h3>
<p>First Inspecting Defenses in Eastern Hunan, Then Heading to Pingxiang; All Party, Government, and Military Positions are Delegated to Commissioners</p>
<p>A communication from Changsha states that He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route Bandit Suppression Army of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Hunan, and Hubei, took office on June 1. His three columns, totaling fourteen divisions and two independent brigades, have been deployed in the area of western Jiangxi, northern Jiangxi, eastern Hunan, and southern Hubei, waiting for orders before September 1. He Jian decided to advance to Pingxiang, preparing to join the bandit suppression armies on the northern and southern routes to encircle and suppress the Western Route. The personnel of the headquarters began to depart for Pingxiang on the 10th, to be completed by the 18th. The headquarters will be located in the Pingxiang Wenchang Palace. He Jian himself was originally scheduled to go to Pingxiang on the 16th, but due to unfinished business, he changed his departure to the 18th. He will first go to the border area of Liling, Chaling, and Youxian in eastern Hunan to inspect the defenses and fortifications, and then go to Pingxiang. The date of his arrival in Pingxiang should be on the 21st or 22nd. He Jian concurrently holds various party, government, and military positions. Due to his imminent departure, he has separately delegated them as follows: (1) The position of Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Government is delegated to Cao Bowen, Director of the Department of Civil Affairs. (2) The position of Commander of the Fourth Route Army is delegated to Wu Jialu, Director of the Staff Office. (3) The position of Standing Committee Member of the Provincial Party Committee is not delegated due to unresolved party affairs disputes, and party affairs are suspended. (4) The position of Chairman of the National Military Training Committee is delegated to Xiang Hongjun. (5) The position of Commander of the Hunan Provincial Security is delegated to Li Jue, Commander of the 19th Division. (6) The position of Director of the Hunan National Martial Arts Training Institute is delegated to Xiang Kairan (i.e. Bu Xiaosheng). (7) The position of Commander of the Fourth Route Army Training Brigade is delegated to Chen Yuxin. (8) The position of Principal of the Qunzhi Political and Legal School is delegated to Yin Deyang. (9) The position of Principal of Dalush Middle School is delegated to Yan Jun. A Rear Headquarters of the Western Route Bandit Suppression Army was established in Changsha, with Deputy Chief of Staff Wu Jialu as director, remaining in the province to preside over all matters. Although the Western Route Army's jurisdiction covers more than forty counties in the adjacent areas of eastern Hunan, western Jiangxi, and southern Hubei, there are only two major bandit forces: Kong Hechong and Xiao Ke (i.e. the original troops of Li Tianzhu), totaling more than twenty thousand guns, twice the number of personnel. Now that He is leading an army of one hundred and forty to fifty thousand soldiers to surround them, it should not be difficult to annihilate them.</p>
<p>Before his departure, He delegated all his concurrent positions to different people, indicating that he intended to return only after the bandit suppression mission was completed. Due to the need to coordinate with the Southern Route Army in this bandit suppression operation, Zhang Qixiong was specially appointed as a representative, stationed in Guangdong. All sectors in Pingxiang, hearing that He was going to Pingxiang, have prepared a warm welcome. It is reported that after arriving in Pingxiang, He will visit Chairman Chiang to discuss everything in person and request military funds. It is reported that Liu Jianxu, Commander of the First Column, has advanced and stationed in Lianhua, and Chen Jicheng, Commander of the Third Column, has advanced and stationed in Damushan. The Commander of the First Column is also He himself, and he will advance into Pingxiang at the same time as the Western Route Headquarters. Appended below are four departure orders issued today (14th): (1) The headquarters will advance into Pingxiang on the 18th of this month. The various departments and directly subordinate units of the headquarters should depart in the order of the Office, Party, Deputy, Economic, Transportation, Ordnance, Law, Medical, and Special Forces, and take vehicles to Pingxiang. The departure time and detailed methods will be determined separately by the Adjutant's Office. However, each department should have one-third of its personnel, led by Deputy Chief of Staff Zheng Zhaoxi, depart in advance on the 16th to deploy everything. (2) Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of the Staff Office of the Fourth Route Army Wu Jialu is appointed as the Director of the Rear Headquarters of the headquarters, responsible for all rear affairs of the headquarters. However, regarding important documents and telegrams, please consult for instructions at any time.</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>(3) Zheng Zhaoxi, Deputy Chief of Staff, and Wu Jialu, Director of the said Rear Headquarters, shall be mutually responsible for handling the liaison matters of all official documents between the front and rear headquarters on a daily basis to avoid conflicts. (4) All military orders within Hunan Province shall be handled by the Hunan Provincial Security Headquarters. (September 14)</p>
<h3 id="e79">Waves of Factional Strife in Hunan <a href="#e79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>The Pi Dao Faction and the Zuan Zi Faction Mutually Exclude Each Other; Huang Jiasheng Laments the Decline of Party Morality</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: In Hunan Province, party affairs have been at a standstill for several months due to the rift between the Pi Dao (i.e., government faction) and Zuan Zi (i.e., non-government faction) factions, which have gone to extremes. In July of this year, the Central Committee specially sent Chen Lifu to Hunan to inspect and seek a solution. After staying in Hunan for a week and investigating the situation, Chen reported to the Central Committee, which issued four measures on August 6th to resolve the factional strife in Hunan: (1) Executive and Supervisory Committee members Xie Zuyao and others (all from the Zuan Zi faction) should resign without discussion to avoid internal disputes. (2) The Road Association (i.e., the Pi Dao faction's organization for manipulating party affairs), as one of the mass organizations, is still allowed to exist. However, the local party branches should send personnel to participate in and guide the Road Association branches in each county. Any Road Association branches in counties where disputes in local party affairs have already been caused and there is evidence of this should immediately cease activities. Liu Yuehou, the chairman of the Provincial Road Association (from the Pi Dao faction), is one of the alternate supervisors of the provincial party branch. He instructed the Road Association branches in various counties to recruit party members and participate in election activities, thereby losing the position of supervisor who should remain unbiased. This is highly inappropriate and should be seriously addressed to the Central Committee to correct past mistakes. (3) The election of representatives to the National Congress should be handled by the Central Committee in conjunction with the provincial party branch after the above two items have been implemented. The date and method of the election will be determined by the Central Committee. (4) The Changsha newspapers are exaggerating the party affairs issue, creating a bad environment and causing the expansion of disputes. In the future, newspapers run by party members that slander the party branch or attack comrades will be disciplined by the party branch and punished by the government. Other newspapers that provoke negative feelings between the party and the government or cause internal party disputes will be stopped by the government. The above four measures reflect the Central Committee's painstaking efforts to take both sides into consideration and to reconcile the feelings of the two factions. Unexpectedly, in practice, it is still difficult to achieve this, and it is becoming more and more chaotic. The Zuan Zi faction is most concerned about the second item, which calls for the abolition of the Road Association to fundamentally eliminate the Pi Dao faction's organization for recruiting party members and manipulating party affairs. The Pi Dao faction is concerned about the second and third items. In addition to ensuring the existence of the Road Association, they also want to take advantage of the fact that many party members in various counties have been recruited to handle elections and achieve absolute victory, convene the National Congress, elect new executive and supervisory committee members according to the regulations, and create a purely Pi Dao party branch, overthrowing the Zuan Zi faction's power in Hunan's party affairs. The solution formulated by the Central Committee failed to fully accommodate the hopes of both sides, so the dispute could not be resolved. More than a month has passed since the order arrived in Hunan. Except for Liu Yuehou, who complied with the second measure and formally submitted a written reply accepting it, Xie Zuyao and others have still not resigned. He Jian has also not entered the party branch for several months. The executive committee of the provincial party branch originally had seven members. Except for Tan Changkai, who was recalled by the Central Committee and whose replacement has not yet been resolved, there are only six members left. Among these six, Zhang Jiong and Wang Qi (both from the Zuan Zi faction) are serving in the Central Committee, and He Jian (from the Pi Dao faction) and Xie Zuyao (from the Zuan Zi faction) are also absent from meetings. Only Zhu Haohuai (from the Zuan Zi faction) and Huang Jiasheng (from the Pi Dao faction) remain, which is not enough for a quorum, so nothing can be handled. The five supervisors, Peng Guojun, Xiao Fengwei, Peng Yunbin, Meng Qingxuan (all from the Zuan Zi faction), and Liu Baoshu (from the Pi Dao faction), are mostly in the provincial capital, but except for Liu, the others have all submitted their resignations and refuse to attend meetings, so the supervisory committee has also stopped meeting. Hunan's party affairs can be said to be completely at a standstill. Therefore, the party affairs workers, having nothing to do during this period, are becoming restless and starting small newspapers to attack each other. The one founded by the Zuan Zi faction is called "Changsha Zheng Bao," and the one founded by the Pi Dao faction is called "Qian Feng Bao." They spare no effort in slandering and scolding each other, and the "Changsha Zheng Bao" is particularly sharp in its attacks on Executive Committee member Huang Jiasheng. As a result, the antagonism between the two factions has deepened. Huang Jiasheng, extremely indignant, reported to the Central Committee for leave and stated that he would not be responsible for party affairs from the 13th onwards. Hunan's party affairs are not only at a standstill but also disintegrating. Attached is Huang Jiasheng's telegram to the Central Committee:</p>
<p>(To the esteemed Nanjing Central Executive Committee: The provincial party branch, since the resignation of Peng (Guojun), Xie (Zuyao), and other committee members, has been suspended for several months. I, Jiasheng, initially believed that it was inappropriate for the highest leading body of party affairs in a province to be suspended during this time of national crisis, causing a bad impression among the people. Furthermore, party affairs should be promoted in conjunction with military affairs during the suppression of bandits, and should not be interrupted for a single day, leaving subordinates at a loss. Therefore, I forgot my own foolishness and, with my status as a standing committee member, tried to maintain the committee's affairs and waited for your committee to resolve the matter, so that there would be a clear direction to follow. Subsequently, Committee Member Chen Lifu personally came to inspect, and then promulgated a clear solution. I was overjoyed, hoping that the resigned committee members could return to their posts from then on, and that the disputes could be eased from then on. However, for more than a month, the committee's affairs have remained in a stalemate, and have recently become even more degraded, specializing in publishing a newspaper that fabricates facts and confuses right and wrong to attack individuals, especially me. While my own innocence remains unharmed, I deeply lament the decline of party morality, which has a significant impact on the party's prestige. I have the party at heart, but I am unable to salvage the situation. In addition, my old illness has recurred and I urgently need to rest. From the 13th of this month, I am requesting leave to recuperate. I am unable to be responsible for all internal and external affairs of the committee. I am sending this telegram to you, hoping for your consideration.) (September 14th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Magistrate of Hua County Begs for Relief <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>The Disaster Area Covers More Than 5,000 Square Li</p>
<p>There Are More Than 300,000 Disaster Victims</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: Xie Suian, the magistrate of Hua County, yesterday submitted a request for disaster relief to the Provincial Government's Department of Civil Affairs, the Provincial Relief Association, and other organizations. The original petition stated: (The tragic situation in the disaster area caused by the Yellow River flood in Hua County has been reported by telegram. The Provincial Government sent Committee Member Wan Xichun and the Provincial Relief Association sent Committee Member Zhang Tianfang to the county with funds for emergency relief. Special Commissioner Fang of the Third District sent Technician Wang Chaofan to investigate. Inspector Wang Deqing of the Control Yuan also inspected. The association has recently sent personnel to conduct district-by-district surveys. It has been reported that more than 600 villages have been flooded, with only more than 20 villages remaining unaffected. The large dikes in the Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Districts have been eroded into deep gullies, with mud and sand added to the sides, reaching depths of more than ten feet. As for the First, Second, Third, Fourth, and Eighth Districts, the water depth in the flatlands still reaches from three to eight feet, and it rises and falls from time to time. The water level has not decreased slightly. Although shelters have been set up for accommodation and funds have been raised for relief, there are too few boats and the sand is silted up, making rescue extremely difficult. To this day, most of the villages have not been able to rescue a single person. In addition, there is a shortage of relief grain and a large number of disaster victims. Each person in the shelter cannot be fully fed every day. The disaster victims in the water cling to green trees or lie prone in collapsed houses, exposed to the wind and dew. They long for rescue and have been looking forward to it for a long time. Unexpectedly, Heaven did not show mercy, and the rain continued, causing the water level to continue to rise. The disaster victims in the water are suffering from cold and hunger, and deaths are reported from time to time. They are either drowning or starving to death. In addition, locusts have reappeared, covering the sky and the earth. The crops in the unflooded areas have also been eaten away. What crime have the people of Hua committed to suffer such a calamity? The tragic situation is truly heartbreaking. Now that these disaster victims are orphaned and waiting to be fed and are on the verge of death, since the large amount of relief funds has not yet arrived, we can only raise funds locally. We have selected villages that have not been flooded and have a small amount of surplus grain to provide a temporary solution. We have already raised funds many times, but all sources have been exhausted. Ultimately, there is not enough porridge for everyone, making it difficult to provide universal relief. Now, with more than 300,000 disaster victims, each person needs three "he" of rice per day, which requires 1,000 "shi" per day. The future is long, how can we continue? Therefore, we have to implore the superiors to quickly allocate the relief grain and funds to save our disaster victims from death and prevent them from ending up in the ditches. Furthermore, the breach dug by the Yellow River this time is both wide and deep, unlike other overflows. Even if the water level drops again, it will still be difficult to avoid flooding Hua County. If the province of Hebei does not quickly block the breach, then there will be no end to the water, and it will be difficult to plant wheat for the next season. Long-term relief will be even more difficult. The old and weak will inevitably sit and wait for death, while the strong and cunning will number more than 100,000. If there are reactionaries who incite them, it will inevitably become a continuation of Jiangxi's situation. If we suppress them, the hungry people are pitiful; if we listen to them, the public order will be worrying. At present, there is talk of equalizing grain in Puyang, which is not unfounded. Our Central Government, the Provincial Government's Relief Association, and various charitable organizations are concerned and compassionate. They must have already planned a large amount of relief funds and properly drafted long-term strategies to save the survivors and protect the people's lives. In addition to publicly recommending representatives Mao Binru, Zhang Tianfang, Wang Yaoshan, and Zhang Jingzhou to take the disaster area maps and photos to Beijing and Bianjing to appeal for help, we beg our magistrate to consider the severity of the disaster and ask the superiors to quickly allocate a large amount of funds to bring the dead back to life and save the hungry from the other shore. We are extremely anxious and await orders.)</p>
<p>The situation in the disaster area of Hua County, according to the county government's investigation, is as follows: (1) Date and process of the flooding: On August 3rd, the dike at Shitou Village in Changyuan, Hebei, was breached by bandits, and the water entered Hua County, reaching a depth of three to five feet. It dropped one foot on the 9th, rose sharply again by more than five feet on the 11th, dropped two or three feet on the 20th, rose more than two feet again on the 21st, dropped more than one foot on the 24th and 25th, rose more than three feet again on the 27th, 28th, and 29th, and dropped more than two feet again on the 1st and 2nd of September. (2) Area of the disaster area: Approximately 5,000 square li. (3) Number of disaster victims: More than 300,000. (4) Number of mu of farmland flooded: More than 5,000 square li, estimated to be worth more than 8 million yuan at 1,500 yuan per square li. (5) Loss of property and livestock: The loss of property and livestock is estimated to be worth more than 10 million yuan. Approximately 15,000 heads of livestock drowned, estimated to be worth approximately 750,000 yuan. (6) Number of houses flooded: Approximately 450,000, estimated to be worth approximately 13 million yuan at 30 yuan per house. (7) Number of deaths: Approximately 10,000. (8) Remarks: The total number of deaths is approximately 10,000, and the property loss is approximately 30 million yuan. In addition, the Hua County Party Branch sent an express telegram to various organizations requesting relief, with extremely earnest words, stating: (This time, the Yellow River breached its banks, flooding more than 600 villages in Hua County. The loss reached more than 30 million yuan, and there are 200,000 disaster victims. The disaster is extremely severe, unprecedented in history. The survivors are waiting for relief, which is urgently needed. However, from August 3rd to the present, only less than 10,000 yuan of relief funds have been received from various sources. Using this small amount to rescue such a large number of people is like a drop in the bucket. As a result, those who are calling for help in the water have exhausted their voices and dried their tears, without seeing a single grain of righteous rice or half a bowl of benevolent porridge. Alas, these disaster victims will die before the rescue arrives and will eventually become drowning ghosts. Some who are unwilling to sit and wait for death risk their lives to escape, but die in the mud because they have no boats to cross. Young women mistakenly board bandit ships and commit suicide by jumping into the water. Such cases are numerous. Alas, these disaster victims are either drowning ghosts or starving ghosts. They do not die in the mud and sand, but die at the hands of thieves. Alas, how tragic! The dead are gone, but the living cannot survive without relief. Our association lacks the ability to create money, so we sincerely call for help and wipe away our tears to ask for assistance. We hope that your association will embody the beautiful virtue of Heaven and Earth and spread the benevolent spirit of disaster relief, generously contributing to the cause and universally helping the disaster victims, so that they can be freed from this long-lasting catastrophe and celebrate their rebirth as soon as possible. We are extremely anxious and await your prayers. The Hua County Party Branch kowtows.) (September 11th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Feng and Pei Counties Hold a Meeting on Blocking the River and Releasing the Dams <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>It Was Resolved to Start Work on October 1st; Contact Teng and Yu Counties to Assist; Xuzhou Circles Telegraph the Province to Request a Halt</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Feng and Pei Counties plan to block the Dasha River mouth and simultaneously release the Erba dams to divert the Yellow River eastwards through its old course. This has aroused opposition from Xiao and Dang Counties. Various circles in Xuzhou also attach great importance to this matter. Through the liaison of the Farmers' Association, they have jointly presented a report to the Provincial Peak, requesting that it be stopped. However, Feng and Pei Counties are very insistent on the plan to divert the water. However, since the proposed blocking of the Sha River mouth is in Gaozhai, Dang County, they have not been able to immediately cross the border to act on their behalf. Therefore, they invited Feng, Pei, and Dang Counties to a joint meeting on Yellow River defense. Dangshan refused to attend. Feng and Pei Counties, believing that this plan must be implemented, held a meeting at the Feng County Government on the 9th. Attendees included Feng County Magistrate Yang Liang, Party Committee Member Li Futing, Director of the Property Office Dong Yujue, Director of the Farmers' Association Peng Shiheng, First District Chief Li Xuchen, Technical Director Feng Shouxin, Pei County Magistrate Hu Zhahe (represented by Wu Shijia), Party Committee Member Tang Tongshu, and representatives of organizations Zhang Jingmin, Li Ting, and Li Dayong. Observers included Feng County Supervisor Huang Tirun, Sixth District Chief Han Shaojiu, Director of the Education Bureau Wang Zilan, and Feng County Government Secretary Jiang Sitong. Yang Liang chaired the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Should the meeting be postponed due to the absence of the Dangshan representative? Resolution: No postponement. (2) The Gaozhai breach has two channels, the first channel has two sections, each approximately 1,000 meters long, and the second channel is 3,000 meters long. How should they be repaired and blocked? Resolution: Repair the first channel first. (3) Establish a dike repair committee. Resolution: Each county will nominate three people to form the committee. (4) How should the work of blocking the Gaozhai breach be distributed? Resolution: The dike repair committee will allocate the work. (5) Should the provincial departments be requested to send personnel to investigate? Resolution: Request the province to send personnel to investigate. (6) Determine the start and completion dates. Resolution: Start work on October 1st and complete it by the 15th. (7) Should supervisors be appointed? Resolution: Each county will nominate ten people. (8) Estimate the number of laborers needed. Resolution: Feng and Pei Counties will each provide 8,000 laborers per day. (9) How should the materials for blocking the breach be procured? Resolution: The committee will plan the procurement. (10) How should the dike construction costs be shared? Resolution: Feng and Pei Counties will each bear one-half, and request the provincial departments to allocate one-half as a subsidy. (11) Propose to telegraph the provincial government and the provincial party branch to forward to the Central Government a request to build a stone dam to block the Yellow River mouth in Lanfeng. Resolution: Approved. (12) Contact Yutai and Teng Counties to assist in blocking the Gao breach. Resolution: Pei County will be responsible for contacting Teng County, and Feng County will be responsible for contacting Yutai County. Based on the observations of the resolutions, Feng and Pei Counties are determined to implement the water diversion plan and are countering the opposition of Dang, Xiao, and Tong Counties by contacting Teng and Yu Counties to assist in the project. Therefore, disputes may be difficult to resolve in the future. The petition from the Xuzhou Farmers' Association, led by the provincial government and the Xuzhou Garrison Headquarters Special Commissioner's Office, is appended below: (As reported in the Xuzhou Daily on the 11th, Feng and Pei Counties sent personnel to measure the area around Gaozhai Erba and are preparing to mobilize police and armed forces to supervise the work, block the Dasha River, excavate the old course of the Yellow River, and divert the Yellow River eastward. Upon hearing this, we were extremely shocked. The eastward flow of the Yellow River, diverting from the Dasha River to the Weihu Lake, is a natural phenomenon that has been impossible to change for nearly a hundred years. Moreover, the river channel is wide and deep, connecting to the lakes and returning along its original course without causing any major harm. The old course, on the other hand, has been gradually raised due to the accumulation of sand over time and has long been transformed into fertile land, supplying national taxes. Villages and towns are densely populated along the coast, and the commercial port of Tongshan County City and the Jinpu and Longhai Railways are particularly vulnerable. If the water is allowed to flow freely and destroy the Erba dams, it will surely rush eastward, flooding cities and towns and creating an unprecedented catastrophe. Furthermore, Xiao and Dang are resisting and are preparing to fight with weapons. The tragic spectacle of a bloody drama should be prevented before it unfolds. As representatives of the farmers of the entire county, responsible for protecting the lives and property of our people, we cannot remain silent. In addition to submitting separate reports, we are sending this urgent telegram to directly report the situation, requesting that you quickly stop this plan to protect the people and prevent a major disaster. We are extremely anxious and await orders.) (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e82">Li Yizhi Discusses the Fundamental Solution to Governing the Yellow River <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The Fundamental Project Lies in Reorganizing the Downstream River Channel; Personnel Are Sent in Four Teams to Measure the Entire Yellow River</p>
<p>Beijing Correspondence: Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, went north from Beijing on the 8th to inspect the river works. On the afternoon of the 12th, accompanied by An Lisen, a surveying engineer from the commission, he arrived in Beijing from Kaifeng and is scheduled to go to Tianjin today (the 14th) to attend the North China Water Conservancy Commission meeting tomorrow. Chief Engineer Xu Xinwu arrived in Beijing a few days ago. However, because Liu Ruiheng, Gu Xiangxian, Xi Dejiong, and others are flying to Bianjing today (the 14th) for inspection, he took the Pinghan train to Bianjing last night to meet them in order to discuss everything. According to Chairman Li, he said the following about the measurement of the Yellow River: (I and surveying engineer An Lisen set off from Beijing on the 8th of this month, arrived in Bian on the 9th, and inspected the breaches in Lanfeng and Kaocheng on the 10th. The breach in Lanfeng has been surveyed and can be blocked immediately. Kaocheng is being surveyed. On the 11th, we traveled west along the south bank of the Yellow River, inspected the bridge over the Yellow River, and then inspected the north bank. That evening, we took the Pinghan express train north and arrived in Beijing on the afternoon of the 12th. Because I am weak and ill, I rested in Beijing for two days. Today (the 14th), I am going to Tianjin with engineer An Lisen to borrow instruments from the North China Water Conservancy Commission and transfer personnel to organize a survey team to measure the two banks of the Yellow River and plan the post-disaster reconstruction project. I will also attend the commission's meeting on the 15th. On the 17th, I will go to Ji'nan, but on the 13th, I received a telegram from Nanjing informing me that the Yellow River Flood Relief Association has sent Liu Ruiheng, Zhou Xiangxian, and Xi Mingjiu to inspect Ji'nan and Bianjing. Therefore, I sent Xu Xinwu on the Pinghan express train to Bianjing to discuss everything. The measurement of the dike construction and post-disaster reconstruction will begin immediately. As for the measurement of the entire Yellow River, four teams will be sent out. The first survey team will start on October 1st, measuring downstream from the Zhengzhou Iron Bridge. The second team will start on October 15th, measuring upstream from the Tongguan Pass. The third team will start on January 1st of next year, measuring upstream from the Zhengzhou Iron Bridge. The fourth team will start on February 1st of next year, measuring upstream from Baotou. In addition, there is the Daowei Engineering Office, which is measuring the Wei, Jing, and Beiluo Rivers. This has already begun. The fundamental plan for governing the Yellow River cannot be discussed in empty words. We must have a deep understanding and familiarity with the entire Yellow River, its important tributaries, and the mountains, soil, climate, and other conditions within the basin before we can determine the plan. The fundamental project can only start with reorganizing the river channel and rationalizing the dikes in the downstream area. To control the flood flow and prevent sediment, we must start in the upstream area. For example, the flood that breached its banks this year reached Shanxi on August 8th, with a flood flow of more than 14,000 cubic meters per second. The flood of the Jing River reached the Dazhou on August 5th and the Jinghui Canal Dam on the 6th, with a flow rate of nearly 10,000 cubic feet per second. When it reached the Jingkou Pass, it met with the flood of the Wei River and entered the Yellow River, resulting in a terrible disaster. The amount of mud in the Jing River during the flood period exceeded 50%. It can be seen that if a large reservoir can be built in the Jing Valley to control the flood flow and prevent sediment, then the Yellow River control project will be more than half completed. Other tributaries have the same relationship. It can be seen that the fundamental plan should not be limited to the Yellow River itself. To determine this plan, we must first measure and study the sediment of each river clearly. The Yellow River's measurement and hydrological observation have not been done before, so it will take at least three years to complete. The fundamental plan can also be determined in the fourth year. However, during this period, the temporary projects must still be emphasized to maintain the current course of the Yellow River and prevent the flood from changing its course. Then the fundamental facilities can be effective. If we do not treat the symptoms, then there is no way to treat the root cause. (14th)</p>
<h3 id="e83">Anhui, Hubei and Jiangxi Provinces Request Dredging the Xiaogushan Channel of the Yangtze River <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>丨Jiangxi-Jiangxi Engineering Bureau Completes Surveying and Mapping丨</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The riverbed of the Yangtze River has been gradually rising due to the lack of dredging for many years. Every summer, when the floodwaters are large, the waterways are blocked, often causing floods and overflowing water, causing disasters. The Yangtze River Waterway Management Committee has repeatedly received requests for dredging and repair from various provinces along the river and local people, but the project is huge and cannot be carried out without huge funds, so it is difficult to implement. Recently, people from Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, in view of the great flood in the Yangtze River the year before last and the Yellow River disaster this year, once again stated the reasons and requested the Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission to first repair the Xiaogushan section of the Yangtze River channel, so that the water can be discharged without obstruction and reduce disasters, and navigation can be made easier and safer. Xi Dejiong, Director of the Engineering Department, believes that the Xiaogushan Riverway is subject to the impact of Poyang Lake and is within the scope of the Jiangxi-Jiangxi Engineering Bureau. He ordered Lin Youlong, Director of the Bureau, to send engineers to investigate. Recently, the work has been completed. According to Engineer Ke of the Bureau, the Jiangway section is narrow, and Xiaogushan was originally isolated in the river. Now it is gradually connected to the land, and the riverbed has increased greatly. The waters of Hanchuan and other rivers in the upper reaches are blocked whenever there is a flood in midsummer, making it difficult to discharge. As a result, the water level between Jiujiang and Anqing differs by several feet, and the waterways near Xiaogushan are also constantly changing. The Customs Office changes its routes several times a month for safety reasons. In previous years, Poyang Lake could be used for storage, but now the lake has also become silted and shallow, causing mutual harm. Therefore, the principle of dredging should be to carry out both the river and the lake, so as to make a long-term plan. The on-site survey has now been completed, and a repair plan is being drafted and submitted to the Engineering Department of the National Economic Commission for review. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">The Main Culprit in Mengcheng's Drug Case Threatens the County Government <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>丨Li Mingxun Has Been Released丨</p>
<p>Bengbu Correspondence: Chen Zaigong, the perpetrator of Mengcheng County, Anhui Province, who manufactured the drug heroin, was previously released by the Fengyang County Government. After hearing the news, various legal groups in Mengcheng believed that the handling was improper and recommended representatives to appeal to the Headquarters of the Three Provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui to Suppress Bandits. The headquarters then sent Geng Zisheng to secretly arrest Li Mingxun in Mengcheng. After capturing the main culprit Li Mingxun and Chen Zaigong fled, Li Mingxun was handed over to the county government for custody and waited to be handed over to the headquarters for legal action. Unexpectedly, after Li was arrested, Li's remaining accomplices bought more than 100 hooligans outside, claiming to be representatives of the people, and rushed to the county government to guarantee Li's release. If they were not allowed to guarantee Li's release, they would rob him by force. Qin Liangzao, the magistrate of the county, and Geng Zisheng, a member of the committee, feared that a major change would occur, so they released Li Mingxun. As a result, the two criminals, Li and Chen, were at large, and their accomplices, seeing that the demonstration was effective, claimed that they must kill the original plaintiff representatives Wang Jianhu and Shao Yabin. They found Wang and Shao in the dark of night, forced them to go to the county government, and forced the county magistrate to take them into custody. Magistrate Qin knew that the local people were strong and feared that a riot would occur, so he temporarily put Wang and Shao in prison. Liu Ya'san, Wu Yaofu, and others went to the county government to reason with the magistrate and asked him to release Wang and Shao. Li and Chen found out and sent their accomplices and hooligans to lie in ambush on both sides of the county government with wooden sticks, waiting to insult Liu and Wu when they went out. Geng Zisheng learned about this and ordered Deputy Captain Chu of the Security Brigade to lead Liu and Wu to the brigade headquarters, where they were lucky enough to escape. It is reported that Geng has sent a telegram to the headquarters to request instructions. (September 15th)</p>

<p>Yu Quanxi, a patrol chief at the First Sub-Station of the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau, harbored a secret love for Song Zhu's daughter, a concubine's daughter. After being rejected, he held a grudge. On the afternoon of the 16th, around 7 PM, he carried a pistol to Song Zhu's residence near Wangxian Bridge and fired a shot, hitting Song Zhu in the left breast. She was severely wounded and taken to the hospital by neighbors for treatment. Yu then seized the opportunity to commit suicide. Song Zhu did not receive timely treatment and died en route.</p>

<p>The first and second installments of the land price tax for the 21st year of Wu County have long passed their collection deadline. However, due to the recent economic ruin of farmers, a significant amount remains unpaid, totaling approximately over 20,000 yuan. Strict collection efforts are currently underway. With the approval of both the Civil Affairs and Finance Departments, the county government has set the collection of the 22nd-year land price tax to begin on the 21st of this month, with a deadline of two months. Late payments will incur a surcharge of 10%.</p>

<p>Qin Wu, the stepmother of Qin Tianfu, a villager from Dazhu Village, Xishan, Dongting, had a romantic nature. She became acquainted with Yang Zhangfa, a boatman from a neighboring village. Qin Tianfu was secretly informed, but lacking evidence, he could do nothing. Qin and Yang had once engaged in a mutual brawl, leading to a lawsuit in court. Qin was fined 30 yuan, causing him to deeply resent Yang. Consequently, Qin, along with a person named Liu, armed with a weapon, ambushed Yang in a mulberry orchard about a li away from the village the day before. On the afternoon of the 14th, around 7 PM, Yang hurriedly passed by. Qin and Liu stopped him, and Qin stabbed him violently in the abdomen with a knife. Yang's abdomen was torn open, his intestines spilled out, and he died instantly. On the afternoon of the 16th, Qin surrendered himself to the local prosecutor's office. After interrogation, he was immediately taken into custody pending investigation and handling. Personnel were also dispatched to the village for examination.</p>
<h3 id="e89">Election Dispute in Wuxi Dayao Township <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>The election dispute in Dayao Township, outside the South Gate, has caused contention and remains unresolved. At the time, a citizen of the township, Pu Shuying, went to register, but was rejected by Qiu Boying, the township head, who designated him as a resident of Bodugang Town. Pu argued that he had moved from Shichang, Kaihua Township, to Shangpu Alley in the township and built a residence there almost 600 years ago, demonstrating his full citizenship in Dayao Township, which no one could arbitrarily deprive him of. He felt it was inappropriate for the Civil Affairs Department to be most capable of interpreting the residency issue. There were also issues with the First District Office's handling of citizen registration. For example, Feng Xishan clearly built a house and resided in Bodu Town, yet became the deputy head of Dayao Township. Shao Shenle was the deputy head of Qingming Town, yet became a citizen and candidate in Changjie Town. Jiang Huanqing lived in Huangniwa outside the South Gate, yet became a supervisory committee member of Daqiao Town outside the North Gate. Such examples were difficult to enumerate throughout Wuxi. Now, being deprived of citizenship, he was unwilling to accept it. Yesterday, he specially stated his reasons and submitted them to the Civil Affairs Department, requesting a strict order to the Wuxi County government to approve his registration in order to uphold civil rights.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 5:05 PM, freight train number 401, departing from Jing, was about to pass the eleventh telegraph pole at the 247-kilometer mark (between Gaozi and Zhenjiang) when a cow was found lying across the tracks. At that time, the train was traveling at high speed, and the cow was unable to avoid it. The driver was also unable to stop the train in time, causing the train to run directly over the cow, killing it. Due to the cow's height exceeding the tracks, the train's front was pushed off the rails, preventing it from moving. It stopped at the site. Upon learning of this, Stationmaster Zeng of Zhenjiang Station, along with the chief and deputy engineers and Inspector Tian Fuxiang of the machine department, went to investigate and ordered flying squad workers to repair it with all their might.

<p>The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial silkworm cocoon prices for this autumn have been resolved by the joint committee of the two provinces' silkworm industry control, using 83 yuan of 20/22 silk at a uniform price of 770 yuan as the standard. This includes 250 yuan for reeling costs, leaving a decision capital of 620 yuan. Assuming a yield of 500 silk per kilogram and 290 kilograms of dried cocoons, with an expenditure of 24 yuan per dan, this is approximately equal to a wholesale price of 29 yuan per dan in the market scale, or 35 yuan per dan in the Sima scale. The reeling yield can be adjusted based on the above standard. Yesterday, the Construction Department issued this proposal to all counties in the province for their information.</p>

<p>Wang went to Huang's residence on Qiqi Road at 3:20 PM yesterday afternoon to meet with Huang Fu, talking until 4:30 PM when Wang finally took his leave. It is said that the conversation concerned various issues such as reorganizing political and financial affairs in North China, and urging Huang to return to the north as soon as possible to preside over political affairs, as bandit activity in the North China war zone has recently been spreading and urgently needs to be addressed.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Receiving Reporters, Contents of Meeting with Song <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>According to what Wang said at his residence yesterday afternoon when meeting with a group of reporters, he came at the invitation of President Sun to attend the board of directors of the Zhongshan Cultural Education Center. He also planned to visit many old friends along the way. His meeting with Finance Minister Song was to discuss the issue of expanding the National Economic Committee. The expansion of the National Economic Committee had already been decided at the Lushan Conference. The first point was the issue of personnel selection. Chairman Chiang was originally the chairman of the National Economic Committee. Chairman Chiang was deeply concerned that outsiders would misunderstand that the loan for American cotton and wheat would be diverted for military spending, so he strongly requested to resign and recommended President Sun, Minister Song, and himself as standing committee members. As for the selection of committee members, they were originally the heads of the relevant ministries and well-known financiers. It is currently undecided whether additional members need to be hired. The second point was the issue of supervision. It was decided to establish a supervisory organization to exist alongside the executive organization. Mass organizations should also send representatives to join and supervise all uses. The third point was the determination of the uses of the American cotton and wheat loan, which was entrusted to the National Economic Committee to be responsible for the distribution. It was originally planned to be used entirely for production, but now it has been decided to narrow the scope and ensure that it is entirely used for cotton and wheat themselves. In other words, this money will be used to improve the production of cotton and wheat in our country.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Diplomatic Policy is National Salvation and Survival <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>There is absolutely no change in the central diplomatic policy. However, the methods of dealing with it must be based on adapting to the environment. This is a very realistic issue. Since no one can come out and recognize (Manchukuo) or abandon the four northeastern provinces, there is no so-called division between the pro-European and American faction and the pro-Japanese faction. Only through joint cooperation and hard work can we focus on the four words of national salvation and survival.</p>
<h3 id="e110">North China's Finances Maintain Credibility <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Since the tightening of finances in North China, monthly expenditures still require more than 4.5 million, while income is still less than 3 million. Currently, war-time agencies are being abolished to save expenses, and efforts are being made to increase revenue to make up for the deficit. The only task for Chairman Huang's visit to the south this time, apart from reporting on the aftermath of receiving the war zone, was to visit Finance Minister Song and consult on the financial problems of North China. There has been considerable progress, and Chairman Huang will return to the north within days. Bao Yulin, director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, has been transferred to the position of committee member of the Beijing Military Sub-Committee. Yu Jinhe, director of the Qingdao Public Security Bureau, has been appointed to fill the vacancy. Director Yu has achieved excellent results during his tenure in Qingdao. This transfer from Qingdao to Beijing was first agreed upon by Mayor Shen Honglie after obtaining Chairman Huang's consent. Furthermore, Chairman Chiang still plans to use Bao in other capacities. Unexpectedly, a movement to retain Bao and reject Yu occurred in Beijing, which is extremely regrettable. Currently, the security in Beijing is temporarily being handled by the district director of the first district, Zhu Ruilin. The central government can express its agreement on this, but will not reverse its decision, maintaining the central government's credibility.</p>

<p>Unless absolutely necessary, there will be no changes to the heads of various ministries of the central government. Minister Gu Mengyu went north to inspect the railways in the war zone and, after returning to Beijing, suffered a cold, resulting in a pseudo-wind illness. Therefore, he took a few days of leave to rest slightly. As for important documents, they are still sent to his official residence for him to personally review. Rumors of his resignation are all speculation. It is also not certain that Minister Chen Gongbo will go abroad. Mr. Jiang Zuobin, the ambassador to Japan, previously went to Lushan for a short stay to rest due to physical discomfort and high blood pressure. Now, according to Ambassador Jiang's telegram, he came down the mountain today (the 16th) and took a boat to Beijing. He is expected to arrive in Beijing the day after tomorrow. When Ambassador Jiang will return to his post will be decided after meeting him in Beijing.</p>

<p>Wang was originally scheduled to return to Beijing last night, but since there were still some trivial matters to be resolved in Shanghai, he decided to take the night train back to Beijing at 11:00 PM tonight.

<h3 id="e113">Huang River Disaster Relief Meeting <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Liu Ruiheng and Others Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Attend</p>
<p>Report on the Inspection of the Disasters in Lu and Yu</p>
<p>The Use of 4 Million Yuan in Relief Funds Has Been Decided</p>
<p>Liu Ruiheng, Standing Committee Member of the National Government's Yellow River Flood Relief Committee and Director of the Health Group; Zhou Xiangxian, Director of the Work Relief Group; and Xi Dejiong, Director of the Disaster Relief Group, and others, were ordered to fly to Lu and Yu to inspect the disaster situation. They completed their tasks and returned to Beijing the day before yesterday. They took the night express train to Shanghai that night, arriving at the North Station at 7:30 AM yesterday. They immediately drove to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance on West Aixiens Road in the French Concession to pay their respects to Song Ziwen, Chairman of the committee, and report on the inspection process and discuss relief methods. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e114">Inspection Process <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Xi Dejiong, Director of the Disaster Relief Group of the committee, took Euro-Asia Airlines' Euro-Asia No. 8 aircraft from Shanghai's Hongqiao Airport at 6:30 AM on the 13th and flew to Beijing. He immediately met with Liu Ruiheng, Director of the Health Group, and Zhou Xiangxian, Director of the Work Relief Group, who were staying in Beijing, and flew northwest along the old course of the Yellow River from Beijing North, passing through Feng County, Juye, Jiaxiang, Zhancheng, and Jining to inspect the flood situation in western Shandong. They then flew along the banks of the Yellow River, passing through Changqing and reaching Jinan on the 14th. They took off from Jinan and flew west along the north and south banks of the Yellow River, inspecting Pu County, Fan County, Shouzhang, and Changyuan and Dongming in Hebei Province, as well as Kaocheng and Lanfeng in Henan, and arriving in Kaifeng on the 15th. From Kaifeng, they went east along the old course of the Yellow River to Jiangsu, passing through Dangshan and Xiao County, and returned to Nanjing.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Relief is Difficult <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>According to reports, the Yellow River flood this time has flowed and flooded the provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Although the flood is not as great as the one in the 20th year, the disaster-stricken area is even more tragic. Because the residents of the counties along the river did not avoid the flood when it came, most of them were swept into the whirlpool. This is because the terrain in the north is very flat, unlike the south where there are high and low areas. Even if there are one or two high places, they cannot accommodate many people. In addition, the Yellow River carries silt, and even after the water recedes, it is still a wet land. There are few boats and carriages, and land and water transportation is difficult. The refugees cannot move and are bound to sit and wait for death. Even if relief supplies are transported, it is quite troublesome. This is why relief feels difficult.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Relief Meeting <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Liu, Zhou, and Xi went to the Ministry of Finance's office to pay their respects to Chairman Song and report. Song originally intended to hold a relief meeting immediately to discuss relief methods. However, because President Wang Jingwei and President Sun Ke had scheduled a visit, it was postponed until 11:10 AM to begin the meeting. In addition to Chairman Song, Liu, Zhou, and Xi, those present included Zeng Rongpu, Director of the General Office of the Committee, and Qin Fen, Director of the Finance Group. During the meeting, Liu Ruiheng reported on the results of the inspection, stating that the most severely affected areas included 67 counties, and the next most severely affected included 20 counties in Shandong, 11 counties in Henan, and 3 or 4 counties in Hebei. There were approximately more than 100,000 disaster victims in need of immediate relief, and so on. After the report was completed, they immediately began discussing relief methods and adjourned at 12:20 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Decided Methods <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>After detailed discussions, it was decided to establish relief offices in Jinan and Kaifeng, and to request the provincial governments to invite local gentry to organize flood relief committees to work together for greater efficiency. The plan to establish an office in Hebei was canceled because the disaster area in Hebei was far from the provincial capital. The 4 million yuan in relief funds allocated by the government was generally decided to be allocated as follows: (1) 1 million yuan for disaster relief, (2) 1.9 million yuan for work relief, (3) 400,000 yuan for purchasing and distributing seeds, and (4) 1.1 million yuan for health, transportation, expenses, and repayment of advances from various provinces. It was also decided to proceed as soon as possible to save the people.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Written Report <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Yellow River Flood Relief Committee released the written report of Liu Ruiheng, Xi Dejiong, and others on the inspection of the disaster area yesterday. The Yellow River Flood Relief Committee, in order to investigate the damage in the various disaster areas, previously sent members Liu Ruiheng, Xi Dejiong, Zhou Xiangxian, and others to Jinan, Kaifeng, and other places to inspect the Yellow River disaster. They have completed their tasks and returned to Beijing by the original aircraft at noon on the 15th. This time, the inspection of the disaster area was carried out along a triangular route. On the first day, they took off from Beijing and passed through Jinxiang, Jiaxiang, Chengwu, and Jining, and then flew northwest to Dong'a and Jinan. On the second day, they took off from Jinan and flew west along the Yellow River, passing through Dong'a, Shouzhang, Pu County, and Changyuan to reach Kaifeng. On the third day, they flew east from Kaifeng, passing through Lanfeng, Kaocheng, Heze, and Dingtao, and returned to Beijing via Xuzhou. In addition to inspecting the disaster situation and taking photos along the way, they also discussed relief matters with the authorities in each disaster area. During the aerial inspection, although they traveled thousands of miles in an instant, they circled over each county they passed through for one or two weeks to conduct a detailed inspection. Therefore, the results were still good and could serve as a basis for implementing relief. Upon investigation, in the Shandong area, such as Shouzhang, Yanggu, Fan County, and Pu County, the flooded land was still a vast expanse of water. In Henan Province, the moon embankments and people's embankments outside the dikes of Kaocheng had been washed away. From the foot of the dikes all the way to the east of the county seat for dozens of miles had been flooded. Countless houses had been washed away, the mud was up to the ankles in high places, and the accumulated water was very deep in low places. The disaster victims gathered in the highest places and slept in the open, a heart-wrenching sight. Changyuan in Hebei, Hua County in Henan, and Pu County in Shandong were particularly severely affected. Although the disaster area south of the Yellow River was vast, the disaster was not as severe as that on the north bank. In total, the area of the disaster area was not as large as that of the Jianghuai River basin in the 20th year, but the tragedy was actually worse. It will also be more difficult to carry out disaster relief in the future. The land routes in the affected areas have become piles of mud, and the waterways lack through-navigation routes and lack ships for transportation. Disaster relief is indeed difficult. As for Hebei, the disaster area is far from the provincial government, which causes many obstacles. Regarding the implementation of relief matters, the three committee members have consulted with Chairman Han of Shandong, Chairman Liu of Henan, and other local officials. This committee will establish relief agencies in Shandong and Henan provinces, and work with local governments, chambers of commerce, emergency relief associations, and Chinese and foreign gentry and merchants to handle the matter. This committee will be responsible for guidance. Relief materials will first be distributed for three urgent needs: clothing, food, and shelter. In areas where fields have been flooded, grain seeds will be distributed. Dikes that have been washed away should be repaired in the shortest possible time. Investigations have now begun to facilitate progress. In terms of work relief, it is planned to first close the breaches, then divert water sources, and build dikes.</p>

<p>Bound for Kaifeng and Luoyang to Distribute Aid</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations' Joint Emergency Relief Association for the Yellow River Flood Disaster, after its previous meeting, resolved to raise 50,000 yuan for emergency relief to the disaster victims. It is learned that the funds have been fully raised, and a special inspection team, headed by Hong San, director of the investigation group, and Jian Wei Dehao, along with eight others, are departing from Shanghai today carrying cotton clothing, medicines, and 20,000 yuan in relief funds to Kaifeng and Luoyang in Henan Province. They will consult with local government agencies to determine the distribution methods and will distribute aid according to the severity of the disaster areas. The incoming telegrams requesting aid from various parties are recorded below:</p>

<p>Regarding the Shandong Provincial Government's telegram, the contents are acknowledged. Your telegram is acknowledged. We have already approved the previous telegram from the Shanghai Charity Organizations' Joint Emergency Relief Association for the Yellow River Flood Disaster, dispatching personnel to investigate and provide 30,000 yuan in emergency relief, and have replied with thanks in our gray telegram, and have also instructed disaster-stricken counties such as Jiaxiang to protect and assist accordingly. Regarding the previous reasons in the telegram, we are enclosing a letter to inform the Relief Affairs Committee of our province. We are replying specifically. The contents have been received by the association. Regarding this case, your previous telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has been separately forwarded with our telegram to the governments of Henan and Shandong provinces, instructing them to assist and protect accordingly. Now, regarding the previous information, we are issuing a corresponding letter. We respectfully hope that you will take note of this. Respectfully addressed to the Shanghai Charity Organizations' Joint Emergency Relief Association for the Yellow River Emergency Relief, Relief Affairs Committee bows.</p>

<p>Brother Zikuan respectfully forwards to Mr. Zhu Ziqiao: During this Yellow River flood, Nan Zhangyuan, Dongming, and Puyang counties were simultaneously breached, with floodwaters reaching a height of two zhang, instantly turning everything into a watery land. The water came too quickly, catching people off guard, resulting in countless deaths of humans and animals, and all belongings were swept away. Over a thousand villages were completely wiped out, and fertile land was transformed into desert. The devastation is far worse than that in Shandong and Henan. Currently, the million disaster victims in these three counties are exposed to the elements, struggling to survive, and are in dire need of food. If emergency relief is not raised, they will inevitably starve to death. Remembering your compassionate heart and our shared concern for the hungry and drowning, your call will be answered by all. Please quickly find a way to raise donations to provide relief to the disaster victims. Our gratitude will be endless. The Jinnan Three Counties Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief Association sends this urgent telegram.</p>

<h3 id="e128">Chairman's Address <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>First, Wu Huanru, representative of the Chairman of the Social Bureau, gave a report. Wu stated, "Today is the opening of the Native Cloth Movement Conference initiated by nine organizations in Shanghai. We have initiated this conference with great significance, especially in Shanghai. Why do we need to promote native cloth? Because Shanghai's society, which loves extravagance, luxury, and showing off, has exposed all the shortcomings of the city. We want to make the citizens of Shanghai realize that the rural economy of China is bankrupt and the national economy has fallen into a very dangerous period. If we continue to admire foreign goods and despise native cloth, China will only go down the road to destruction. How can we remedy this? Naturally, we can only promote the native products produced by our own rural areas in China. Among native products, native cloth is the most important. However, the future development of the native cloth industry depends entirely on whether our people are willing to use it or not. If we want the native cloth industry to develop, according to my personal opinion, there are about three ways to expand sales: (1) Native cloth merchants should have the determination to struggle. Although the native cloth produced by farmers is of solid quality and cheap in price, compared with the durable foreign cloth, its texture is not as fine, its color is not as beautiful, and its value is also very cheap. People who buy and use it generally only care about the current beauty and abandon native cloth for foreign goods. Our native cloth stores should have the determination to fight, not hesitate to make any sacrifices, to confront the foreign cloth industry, and persuade customers to try it, so that they gradually know the benefits of native cloth, and sales can be slowly expanded. (2) Native cloth producers should strive to improve native cloth. The texture of native cloth is not as delicate as that of foreign cloth, and the patterns are not as fashionable, as mentioned earlier. Therefore, if we want to expand sales, we must find ways to improve these two points. Native cloth producers should unite and hire knowledgeable and experienced technicians to guide and supervise in order to develop, such as the improvement of iron looms, the widening of storefronts, and the promotion of uses, all of which should be deeply studied in order to be effective. (3) Government promotion and encouragement. The native cloth industry is the only sideline of farmers. At this time of rural economic bankruptcy, the government should do its utmost to promote and encourage its development. The methods are: first, order all subordinate agencies, schools, officials, and students to give priority to purchasing high-quality native cloth for their uniforms to set an example; second, establish a native cloth bonus fund and formulate bonus rules to encourage. In addition, the government needs to help with the sponsorship of native cloth exhibitions and other publicity aspects. In short, the development of the native cloth industry requires the joint efforts of the government, native cloth merchants, and native cloth manufacturers."</p>
<h3 id="e129">Speeches and Entertainment <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>After the chairman's report, seven or eight people, including Mao Yun, representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Chen Kecheng, representative of the Nan Government, and Chen Bai, representative of the Municipal Education Bureau, spoke in succession. The meanings of the words were similar and are omitted. After the speeches, there was entertainment to add to the fun. Participants included the harmonica group from the People's Education Center, as well as costume speeches. In addition, Mr. Shen Zhisan and Mr. Zhang Shuzhen, two staff members of the center, performed a double act. Guest Mr. Li Zhaoxiong performed magic tricks, which were quite brilliant and won a lot of applause. The performance by the kindergarten students of Lin Yin Elementary School was also lively, agile, and delightful.</p>
<h3 id="e130">A Glimpse of the Exhibition <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>The Native Cloth and Thrift exhibitions were visited. There were two rooms, designed and arranged by Li Yanqing of the native cloth store. All materials were also supplied by the store. Upon entering, there was a wooden spinning machine. The types of items displayed included various cotton fiber specimens, main cotton crops, insect pest specimens, cotton chemical fertilizer specimens, cotton natural fertilizer specimens, the entire plant specimen of Jiangyin white-seed cotton, the entire cotton plant specimen from the Farmers' Education Center, various native cloth raw materials from the Municipal Agricultural Experiment Field. On the walls were displayed over twenty specimens and charts from the Municipal Garden Field, various three-dimensional drawings of the thrift movement from the Shanghai Municipal People's Education Center, which were quite eye-catching. Other items, such as comparative charts of cotton and rice experiments over two years, showing the yield per hectare, as well as tables of thrift facts of emperors of past dynasties, tables of thrift facts of literati of past dynasties, and family expenditure budget tables, were all of great value.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Representatives from All Sectors of the City to Hold September 18th Memorial Meeting Tomorrow <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters Issues a Notice to the Public</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau Maintains Strict Alert</p>
<p>Tomorrow is the anniversary of the September 18th Incident, the national humiliation day when Japan invaded and occupied our Northeast. In addition to appointing Committee Member Jiang Huaisu as the chairman of the meeting, the Municipal Party Headquarters has notified all agencies, organizations, and schools in the city to send representatives to participate at that time and has also printed and distributed a notice to the public. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, fearing that reactionary elements would take the opportunity to cause trouble, has instructed its subordinates to maintain strict alert. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Meeting Notice <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the matter of notification, September 18th is the second anniversary of the day the Japanese invaders occupied the Northeast. All our compatriots should uniformly suspend entertainment, lower flags to half-mast to express grief, cease work at 11:00 AM, stand up for five minutes, silently swear to wash away the national humiliation, and express deep condolences to the martyrs in the three northeastern provinces, Rehe, the Great Wall passes, Luandong, and Songhu, and the generals and soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the country. Our association will also convene representatives from all walks of life at 9:00 AM on the same day in the auditorium on the third floor of our party headquarters to hold a memorial meeting. A special notification is hereby issued, hoping that all agencies, organizations, schools, and party headquarters at all levels in the city will hold meetings separately in accordance with the above methods and send two representatives with a letter to attend the meeting. A notification is hereby issued for the purpose of the above.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Strict Alert <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Tomorrow is the second anniversary of (September 18th). Municipal Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen fears that reactionary elements will take the opportunity to plot unrest, using the memorial as a pretext to disrupt order. Therefore, he has specially instructed all districts, stations, and teams under his command to implement a uniform alert throughout the city tomorrow (September 18th). On this day, those who have not been approved by Party and government agencies shall not hold meetings or parades without authorization. Those who violate this will be arrested. On one hand, he instructed his subordinates to increase the number of double-person posts on all major roads and streets. In areas bordering the Chinese and French Concessions, personnel were dispatched to carry out inspections. All inspectors and detectives were mobilized for security. It is reported that the police authorities of the Public and French Concessions also have similar arrangements to prepare for any eventuality.</p>

<p>| Preparing to Add Fourth-Class Passenger Cars |</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways' Purchasing Committee previously purchased 70,000 American pine sleepers from Xiangtai Lumber Company on behalf of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway. The company delivered the first batch of 4,713 sleepers some time ago. The second batch has also arrived at the Zhanghuabang Railway Wharf and has been unloaded. After deducting those that did not meet the requirements, the actual number of sleepers received was 10,622. The Ministry of Railways sent Zhang Yuandong, chief of the Engineering Section of the Transportation Department of this railway, to inspect and accept the delivery. It is reported that the Shanghai-Nanjing section urgently needs these sleepers, and the Wusong Materials Factory has notified the Transportation Department to prepare cars immediately and transport 10,000 sleepers to the Shangbei and Suzhou sections for use. The third batch, estimated to arrive at the port around the 17th of this month, will be more than 40,000 sleepers. Furthermore, to facilitate passenger transport, the two railways are preparing to add six fourth-class passenger cars to meet the needs. It is reported that the lumber required for the construction of these cars was ordered from Jiuji Lumber Company, and it was transported to Wusong the day before yesterday. It included one-inch, three-inch, and six-inch tongued and grooved boards and American pine squares, which were also inspected and accepted by Section Chief Zhang Yuandong. (Xin Xin News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e143">On Foreign Rice and Wheat Dumping <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Oilcake Trade Association telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan's Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "In recent years, the prices of rice, wheat, and flour have plummeted, causing hardship for both farmers and businesses. The main reason for this is the dumping of foreign rice, wheat, and flour in our domestic market. Imposing an additional tax on foreign rice, wheat, and flour is the primary solution to alleviate the plight of farmers and businesses. For months, people's organizations in various regions have been appealing, and the chairmen of the six provinces of Lu, Wan, Gan, Xiang, E, and Yu have been requesting intervention. People from all walks of life are eagerly hoping for its implementation, but it has not been adopted. Then, how can the so-called rural revitalization achieve tangible results? This year's wheat harvest is abundant throughout the country, and the new grain is about to enter the market, and prices are continuing to decline. Blocking the dumping of imported rice and wheat is an urgent matter. We sincerely request that you respect public opinion and implement it quickly to satisfy the people's hopes. It is to be greatly hoped. Chairman Gu Xinyi of the Shanghai Grain, Oil, and Oilcake Trade Association respectfully bows."</p>
<h3 id="e144">Chen Wenlin Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Accompanied by Workers, He Leaves for Xuzhou to Repair the Aircraft the Same Night</p>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports: Chen Wenlin, director of the Naval Aviation Department, flew from Nanjing to Jinan in the Jiangque aircraft the day before yesterday. Unfortunately, the oil pipe malfunctioned near Xuzhou, forcing a landing, and the aircraft body was damaged. Chen arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning from Nanjing. After arriving in port, he went to the aircraft department to visit Director Zeng Yijing and requested that workers be sent to Xuzhou to repair the aircraft. According to Chen, the damage to the Jiangque aircraft was caused by the exhaustion of gasoline in the upper part of the engine, while the oil in the lower part could not be pumped up. When the gasoline in the upper part was exhausted, the engine made a sound. At that time, it was very close to Xuzhou, and for safety, he landed at Sanbugu. However, although the area was flat, the ground was loose and slippery due to heavy rain in the previous days. When the aircraft landed, the wheels sank into the soil, causing it to overturn. Fortunately, the damage was not significant, and it can be repaired in about four days and fly north as usual. After arriving in Shanghai, Chen immediately purchased a new rotor blade that he had previously purchased in Shanghai, along with four workers, and took some repair materials and left for Beijing by car last night, en route to Xuzhou for repairs.</p>
<h3 id="e145">The Municipal Bureau of Public Safety Ordered to Protect Newspaper Reporters <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday Issued Instructions to Subordinates</p>
<p>The Kuomintang News Agency reports that the Shanghai Municipal Government, in accordance with a consultation from the Ministry of Interior, has ordered the Public Safety Bureau to earnestly protect all personnel in the news industry. The order reads: (Regarding the matter of instructions, based on the Ministry of Interior's consultation, which was based on the Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 3921, which was based on the Kuomintang Government's Civil Affairs Office's Public Letter No. 3667, which was based on the Central Executive Committee Secretariat's Letter No. 12966, which was based on the Standing Committee's referral of the Jiangsu Provincial Executive Committee's request to order all levels of government and military throughout the country to earnestly protect news industry personnel, etc., which was approved and forwarded to the Kuomintang Government, etc., requesting review and handling, etc., which was then forwarded and His Excellency the Chairman instructed it to be handled by the Executive Yuan, etc., and a letter was sent to inform them to investigate, etc. It is hereby noted that, according to the law, people may not be arrested, detained, interrogated, or punished, and people have the freedom to express opinions and publish writings, which may not be stopped or restricted except in accordance with the law. Articles 8 and 15 of the Provisional Constitution for the Period of Political Tutelage have already clearly stipulated this. Now, based on the previous report, the Provincial Party Headquarters has noted that local governments often do not cherish news industry personnel, and in some cases even arbitrarily destroy them, and has specially requested that a general order be issued for their protection, which is deemed feasible. The Ministry of Interior should issue a general order to all provincial and municipal governments and the Ministry of Military Affairs, ordering all military units or military agencies to earnestly protect all news industry personnel. In addition to sending a reply and separate orders, the original report is copied and sent for review and compliance. The original report is attached. (It is noted that newspaper reporters have the responsibility of disseminating culture and reforming society. Therefore, all countries in the world have special provisions for the protection of newspaper reporters, providing them with convenience. China's news industry is still in its infancy. Local governments not only fail to fulfill their duty to protect them, but even disregard legal protections and arbitrarily destroy them, as in the cases of Liu Yusheng and Wang Weisan, which are particularly prominent. Therefore, many people with aspirations in the news industry view the news industry as a dangerous path, and public opinion is depressed, which has a significant and profound impact on society and the public, not only on the news industry itself. For the sake of developing the news industry and improving public opinion, it is necessary to earnestly protect the safety of newspaper reporters. This has been decided at the first meeting of the News Industry Committee of this association, and a report has been submitted to the Central Government requesting that the National Government issue a general order to all levels of government and military throughout the country to earnestly protect news industry personnel. It is hereby recorded and submitted for review and approval, which is a convenience for the party. Respectfully submitted to the Central Executive Committee, the Jiangsu Provincial Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Standing Committee Members Zhou Shao, Lan Weibin, and Niu Changyao. It is reported that after receiving the order, Wen Hong'en, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Safety, has issued a general order to all districts, offices, and teams under his jurisdiction to earnestly protect all personnel in the news industry in order to maintain culture.</p>

<p>Effective from September 15th, for a period of three months</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic cement has suffered a major blow due to the dumping of foreign goods. The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations consider the China Cement Company to be one of the major industries along the railway lines, with a large annual volume of transportation. In order to adopt a mutual assistance approach, it is proposed to reduce the freight rate for China Cement by 10% compared to ordinary freight rates, in order to benefit both parties. This proposal has been submitted to the Ministry of Railways and approved under Instruction No. 16221. It is now scheduled to be implemented from May 15th for a period of three months, and the bureau has ordered the Traffic Department to comply.</p>

<h3 id="e150">Reports Received by the Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee Regarding the Henan-Shandong Disaster <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Famine Relief Committee, in view of the severe flooding along the Yellow River, has sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations and is raising funds for relief. Yesterday, it received reports from Henan and Shandong, which are particularly distressing. They are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>A letter from the Wuzhi Relief Association states that on August 9th of this year, the Yellow River swelled, and the water level was higher than the embankment, resulting in the flooding of ninety villages southwest of Wuzhi. Houses collapsed, livestock was swept away, crops were destroyed, and countless people drowned. The old and young are living in the wild, exposed to the elements, crying all night, which is unbearable to hear. The first district has a low-lying terrain, surrounded by the Yellow River dike in the south, the Qin River dike in the east, and the Qin River dike in the north. The water has no way to escape and remains a vast expanse of water. In dozens of villages, including Li Houzhuang, not only were the autumn crops flooded, but it is also difficult to sow spring wheat. The people are in dire straits, lamenting at the sight of the water, which is heartbreaking. This is the disaster situation in the southwest. In the southeast corner, the iron bridge and railway run across the area. Over the years, too much stone has been piled up in the riverbed to protect the bridge, resulting in poor drainage downstream. When the Yellow River suddenly rose, the water was level with the bridge, and the water ravaged the area. Houses were swept away. The town of Zhan Dian, more than ten miles from the river, was flooded, destroying thousands of houses, as well as more than twenty villages, including Lao Tian'an and Wei Zhuang. This is the disaster situation in the southeast. In addition, locusts are everywhere, devouring the autumn crops, and there is no hope of a harvest.</p>
<p>A letter from the Yanzhou Catholic Church states that the disaster situation in the southwest of our district, such as Changfen, Dongming, Heze, Chengwu, Wen Shangpo South, Juye North, Jincheng Wuxiang, Yutai, and Yanggu Shouzhang Puyang Fanxian, is particularly serious. The autumn crops have been completely destroyed. Not to mention the villages that have been turned into plains and the houses that have been submerged in mud. Those who died were buried in the bellies of fish, and those who survived were displaced, suffering from hunger and cold, crying everywhere. The general state of misery is unbearable to hear. If it comes to winter, it will be even more unimaginable.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Appeals Must Be Decided by Ruling <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Safety recently received instructions from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, which stated that, in accordance with the order of the Judicial Yuan, it has been found that when administrative agencies in various provinces and cities handle appeals, they often fail to serve the ruling in accordance with the law and only issue instructions and orders, making it impossible for appellants to file further appeals, resulting in delays and losses. Therefore, after administrative agencies handle appeals, they must prepare a ruling in accordance with Article 10 of the Appeals Law and serve it on the appellant so that the appellant can file a further appeal within the ten-day statutory period if they have any objections, and they must not issue instructions and orders. In addition to issuing separate orders, it is ordered that subordinate agencies comply with this. After receiving the order, Director Wen has ordered subordinate agencies to comply.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Declaration of Donation Relief for the Typhoon Disaster in Southern Chuansha <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>The Southern Chuansha Typhoon Relief Committee of the Pudong Association issued a declaration yesterday stating:</p>
<p>Crossing the Huangpu River to the east, at the end of the Shanghai urban area, Chuansha is to the north and Nanhui is to the south. In Chuansha County, there are three larger sandbars: Hengsha, Gaoqiao, and Yuanyuan Sha. The total population of more than 10,000 has built dikes to form fields, with villages facing each other and the sounds of chickens and dogs audible. The land is suitable for cotton and wheat, and there is a considerable amount of production each year to supply the food for the entire society. On the night of September 2nd this year, a hurricane struck, and the tide suddenly rose. Residents woke up from their dreams to see the flood raging. Climbing on the roofs, the roofs collapsed, and trees were broken. Men, women, old, and young, cried in the wilderness. In an instant, almost the entire sandbar was submerged. Chuansha County Magistrate Li Zihan and the gentlemen of the Yuanshan Hall, including Lu Wenmei, were immediately informed and went to inspect. All the dikes were broken. Some families were missing. Some were more than ninety years old, alone, on the verge of death but not yet dead. Some were three or four-year-old children crying for their mothers. Most were drifting about, hungry and unable to eat, cold and shivering, unable to clothe themselves. The number of those who were buried in the bellies of fish is uncountable. In the reed clumps, people and animals were piled up dead, and the stench was overwhelming, making it impossible to pass. One farmer's wife climbed on the roof, unable to hold on, grabbed a piece of wood, and clung to it until she died, drifting with the current for a day and a night to the coast of Ningbo, where she was rescued and returned home. Apart from this, the number of families who were destroyed and died is unknown. It is estimated that more than 7,000 people were affected by the disaster. The autumn harvest is hopeless, and they will not be able to live on their own until the spring harvest next year. Alas, are those who died piled up and those who survived are barely breathing in the cold wind and rain, in the clumps of reeds and broken docks, not our compatriots of the Republic of China? Are they not our peaceful, patriotic, and productive pure and good people? The clothes we wear and the food we eat, when we trace their origins, all come from their years of toil and labor. Now, those who normally clothe and feed us are dead. Those who have not died are also on the verge of death. Can we close our eyes to their misery and turn a blind eye to their suffering? Can we plug our ears to their cries and pretend not to hear them? Our government and well-intentioned people in our society are vigorously advocating for the revitalization of rural areas and the relief of farmers. If we abandon this most productive rural area, where the disaster is most serious and the need for relief is most urgent, without providing relief, it would be a loss of conscience in morality and a miscalculation in politics. The officials of Chuansha and the local public groups have done their best to provide emergency relief. The population in need of food is estimated at 5,000, with a monthly food cost of two yuan per person, totaling 10,000 yuan. Until the spring harvest next year, for eight months, 80,000 yuan is needed. The number of households without homes is estimated at 2,000, with aid for building houses at 1,000 yuan per household, requiring 20,000 yuan, for a total of 100,000 yuan. Half of this amount is needed for immediate relief. The needs of the coastal areas of the mainland are not included in this. In the coastal areas of the mainland, such as the dikes in the first, second, and fourth districts of Nanhui, which have collapsed, submerging more than 30,000 acres of fertile land, more than 200 houses have been blown down or destroyed, more than 1,000 stones of grain have been flooded, and more than 1,000 people have climbed on roofs to escape the water. To the north, the fourth and fifth districts of Chuansha are largely similar and are still under investigation. The members of this association do not dare to be private about their hometown friendship. For the sake of humanity, we dare to ask benevolent people and righteous people in the world, public and private legal entities, to generously assist us, to save one more disaster victim, to preserve one more good farmer's life, and to maintain one more source of production. Vast floods, floating white bones, living as toiling farmers in the summer fields, dying as flowing corpses in the autumn tide, we use our tears to plead for the release of benevolent purses. Office: Pudong Association, Intersection of Jiangxi Road and Sijing Road, Shanghai. Donation Address: Pudong Bank at the same address. September, 1933, Southern Chuansha Typhoon Relief Committee of the Pudong Association, Du Yuesheng, Mu Ouchu, Huang Renzhi, Shen Menglian, Lu Yuequan, Qin Yanqi, Wang Yiting, Jiang Zhuoyun, Zhang Xiaoliang, Fu Zuoheng, jointly declare.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Red Cross Relief for the Yellow River Disaster <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>The World Red Cross Society is handling the emergency relief for the Yellow River flood. The Beijing General Association is coordinating with the Jinan Red Cross Society to provide emergency relief to the disaster-stricken provinces. The Shanghai General Office of the Association received a report from the Jinan Red Cross Society yesterday on the emergency relief situation. The report was very detailed. It is hoped that all Red Cross Societies and charitable organizations will go there as soon as possible to continue the relief efforts. At the same time, the Southeast Red Cross Society has also sent a letter reporting on its active efforts to raise cotton clothing to help the victims keep warm. The original letter is recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Report from the Jinan Red Cross Society to the Shanghai General Office of the World Red Cross Society: Respectfully, the Yellow River in Hebei and Henan breached its banks in August of this year, affecting various counties in western Shandong. The eight counties of Heze, Puyang, Fanxian, Shouzhang, Yanggu, Cao County, Juye, and Dong'a were the most affected, with a wide disaster area and a particularly severe disaster situation. The six counties of Jiaxiang, Shan County, Chengwu, Dingtao, Dongming, and Jicheng were less affected. The five counties of Jinxiang, Yutai, Jicheng, Feicheng, and Changqing were secondary. Although the situation is different in each of the above nineteen counties, the people are displaced, the autumn crops have completely failed, and the collapse of houses and the drowning of people and animals are all too common. Although the water has now subsided, it is autumn, and the victims have no clothes or food, and are exposed to the wind and rain. The heartbreaking and tragic situation is extreme. The situation is particularly severe in Heze and other counties. The association regards relief as its duty. When the Yellow River first breached its banks, the Jinan Association immediately telegraphed the various counties of Beijing, Shanghai, Yantai, and Qingdao to coordinate preparations. Upon hearing of the Heze disaster, it immediately invited Mr. Yu Fuhe and team members Liu Miaojue, Xiang Junlin, etc. to carry relief funds and various medicines to distribute as the first batch of emergency relief. It then convened a fundraising conference, and representatives from various associations gathered in Jinan to discuss fundraising. More than 10,000 yuan was collected on the spot. The Qingdao, Yantai, Shanghai, Xichang, and Tai Associations remitted funds to Jinan. Yu Jingsi, team leader, etc., were designated to go to Puyang Shouzhang, and Chairman Wang Biankui and team members Li Yuxiao and Wang Hongzhao were designated to go to Fengpei Dangshan in Jiangsu Province, carrying relief funds and medicines to distribute as emergency relief. Chairman Han Weixu was also designated to go to Dong'a Dongping. At that time, the General Association also sent President Su Jinglin Lu Xuanda and four team members with funds to Jinan. It was decided that Lu Jinxuan from the Association, Jing Weiyi, and two team members would carry relief funds and medicines. President Su and Zhang Suwei from the Association and two team members carried funds and medicines and went to Juye Yang Fan Shou and other counties to investigate and distribute. The General Association also sent President Cao to investigate and distribute emergency relief in the counties under Cao's jurisdiction, and President Nie to investigate and distribute emergency relief in Puyang, Hebei. The above has already been relieved by the Association, a total of ten counties in western Shandong and one county in Hebei. The remaining counties are currently being raised and will continue. However, the disaster is serious and the area is vast, which is not something that a few associations can handle. It is still hoped that various associations and charitable organizations will quickly take action, generously contribute, and work together to save this catastrophe. Attached are fourteen photos of the situation in Heze, which are for your review.</p>
<p>Letter from the Southeast Association: Respectfully, Heaven is unforgiving and has brought disaster again. The Yellow River has broken its banks, and the floodwaters have spread. Hundreds of thousands of victims in the riverine areas of Henan, Hebei, and Shandong provinces have suffered the same tragedy. The people are displaced, and the livestock has been drowned. The old and weak are swept into the quicksand and turned into insects and cranes. The young and strong climb to the tops of trees, barely alive. The dead are gone, but what about the living? The association, whose duty is relief, cannot bear to sit idly by and watch them perish. It has already raised relief funds and remitted them to the Beijing Association. The General Association and its branches have organized a large-scale relief team and rushed to the disaster area to distribute emergency relief to temporarily relieve the immediate crisis and to plan for continued relief. Now that the golden winds are blowing and autumn is coming, the disaster victims have neither food nor clothing, and are suffering from both hunger and cold, making it difficult for them to survive. The association now intends to purchase and prepare 10,000 sets of cotton clothing to be transferred to the disaster area for use as winter protection. However, the association is deeply ashamed of its meager strength and the difficulty of providing universal relief. It can only rely on the great philanthropists to be compassionate and to generously contribute to this righteous cause. Not only will the disaster victims share the benevolence of those who have helped them, but the association will also be grateful for their great kindness. If you are willing to donate relief funds, the association will issue an official receipt to show your great faith. I respectfully submit a brief outline, and I hope that you will give it your consideration.</p>

<p>Public safety should be maintained, but beatings and violence are not appropriate.</p>
<p>When people are desperate, they will hang themselves, and violence cannot suppress them.</p>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, on behalf of the insurance claimants in the disaster area, wrote a letter to the Municipal Council regarding the beating of a detective. The letter stated: Dear Sirs, We have received a letter from the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Claim Advancement Association on September 14th (the original letter has already been seen in this newspaper on September 15th). It has been found that this matter is very complicated. Only the insurers and the insured can find a suitable solution themselves. Even if the impartial agency has no intention of being biased, if it appears to be biased, it will only make the matter more complicated and create other problems. If the insured's claim movement goes beyond the scope of a debt collection, and disrupts public safety, the impartial agency should handle it according to the law. Beatings and violence are not appropriate. It must be known that when people are desperate, they will hang themselves, and violence cannot suppress them. As the ancient philosophers said, "Those who suffer a great loss are bound to be heartbroken," which is not a deceptive statement. Therefore, we are writing to your council to request appropriate disciplinary action to avoid further complications. Respectfully, to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the Public Concession.</p>
<h3 id="e155">News from Yesterday Regarding the Fire Insurance Claim Tide in the Disaster Area <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>A Meeting Was Held and a Telegram Was Sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Requesting Negotiations</p>
<p>The Fire Insurance Claim Advancement Association of the Zhabei Disaster Area has been unable to obtain compensation for fire insurance claims in the disaster area for days. There has been an unexpected twist. Association member Song Liangcai was beaten and injured. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. A meeting was held again at 2:00 p.m. yesterday at a certain general association on Edward Road to discuss the continuation of the claim process and a telegram was sent to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs requesting negotiations and strict punishment for the detectives who committed the assault. The details are divided as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e156">Meeting Results <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The results of yesterday's meeting were decided as follows: (1) Telegram the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to request negotiations and strict punishment for the detectives who committed the assault; (2) Write a letter requesting the prompt issuance of fire insurance public bonds; (3) Continue to claim compensation, awaiting a reply from the Insurance Trade Association; (4) Appoint Wang Binyan and Ye Xiaoshan as representatives to comfort the injured committee member Song Liangcai; (5) Confidential.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Nanjing, Regarding the negotiations on fire insurance compensation in the Shanghai 128 disaster area, although the insurance companies previously agreed to issue bonds as compensation, they have still not been resolved. The disaster victims are displaced and lack the means to make a living, and have no choice but to continue to claim compensation from the insurance companies. However, on the 14th of this month, when the insured went to Fengsheng Insurance Company at No. 38 Edward Road to claim compensation, the police station sent more than 20 Chinese and foreign detectives, who beat the claim committee member Song Liangcai without asking any questions, causing him to spit blood and suffer serious injuries. The insured in the disaster area, who have no weapons in their hands, are claiming compensation from the insurance companies and have not violated any laws. The association had previously sent a letter to the police station asking for their protection, so why did the detectives who were sent beat the insured instead? This is completely disregarding justice and is inhumane. Now, more than 100,000 victims are determined to die with the insurance companies. If this continues, the May Thirtieth Incident may be repeated. The association is in a leading negotiating position and cannot remain silent. The above is a report of the beginning and end of the matter. We respectfully request that your ministry promptly negotiate with the Shanghai Concession authorities, strictly punish the detectives who committed the assault, and ensure the safety of all disaster victims in future claims so as to prevent the expansion of disputes. We are extremely ashamed and look forward to your support. The Standing Committee of the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Compensation Advancement Association, Yu Qiaqing, Fang Jiaobo, Chen Songyuan, Tang Youwei, Wang Binyan, Ye Xiaoshan, etc., and the claim association Wang Zhixiang, Ma Rugen, Zheng Shaojin, etc., bow their heads.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Sharp Decline in U.S. Far East Trade in June <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Officially Announced by the U.S. Department of Commerce</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reports that the local office has received a telegram from the U.S. Department of Commerce, reporting that U.S. exports to and trade with the Far East in June totaled US$53,247,000, an increase of US$11,872,000 over the previous month's total of US$51,375,000. However, it was still 0.2% lower than the same month last year. Among them, U.S. exports to the Far East in June were worth US$20,073,000, a decrease of 2.3% compared to the same month last year. Exports to China decreased from US$5,068,000 to US$4,610,000. Exports to Japan increased from US$6,635,000 to US$7,720,000. Exports to Australia were worth US$2,360,000, an increase of US$353,000 compared to the total value for the entire last year. Exports to the Philippines decreased from US$3,516,000 to US$3,063,000. The value of Far Eastern goods imported into the United States in June was US$33,174,000, a slight decrease compared to US$33,540,000 in the same month last year. Purchases from China increased from US$2,610,000 to US$3,035,000. Purchases from Japan increased from US$8,542,000 to US$11,467,000. Purchases from the Philippines increased from US$8,061,000 to US$10,082,000. Comparing the trade figures for June with those for May, U.S. goods exported to China increased from US$3,749,000 to US$4,610,000. Exports to Japan decreased from US$8,267,000 to US$7,720,000. Exports to Australia increased from US$1,847,000 to US$2,360,000. The total for the first six months of this year was far lower than that for the same period last year, with the total export value decreasing by 22% from US$37,776,000 to US$23,269,100. Among them, U.S. exports to the Far East were worth US$123,786,000 in the first half of the year, a decrease of 31% compared to the same period last year. This is mainly because trade with China has been affected by the fluctuating exchange rates, low silver prices, and the unstable situation in China since the Sino-Japanese conflict, which has made merchants hesitant to purchase more goods. Japan has faced financial difficulties and failed in the neighboring cotton yarn and cotton cloth markets, resulting in a sharp decrease in U.S. cotton exports to Japan. India has also had internal political problems, resulting in a sharp decrease in the sales of U.S. goods.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Requests Customs to Adopt New Weights and Measures <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>So That the Implementation of the New System of Weights and Measures May Proceed Unhindered</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Customs Administration, etc., requesting that orders be given to the Customs to adopt new weights and measures. The original text is as follows: To the esteemed Ministry of Finance, Customs Administration, and Ministry of Industry. It has come to our attention that this Chamber previously received a letter from the Qimen Tea Industry Association, complaining that the Shanghai Foreign Tea Traders Association did not comply with the use of new weights and measures, causing tea merchants to suffer unbearable losses, and requesting government support. In response, after the implementation of the new system of weights and measures, various places have been using both new and old systems, leading to commercial disputes, which is not in line with the principle of consistent orders. Therefore, we sent personnel to investigate and found that the reason why foreign tea firms in Shanghai have not yet adopted the new weights and measures is that Shanghai, Hankou, and Fuzhou are major trading ports that conduct business with foreign merchants. They have always used the "pound" system, with 75% converted into Chinese "quan," which is equivalent to 16 taels and 8 qian on the "sima" scale. All customs offices in Hunan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Shanghai are directly under the government and still uniformly use the old "sima" scale system without adopting the new system. The foreign tea trade has direct relations with the customs. If the customs can take the lead in implementing the new weights and measures, the industry will naturally change without any problem. This matter was submitted to the 49th meeting of the Standing Committee of this Chamber, which resolved to telegraph Your esteemed Ministries/Administrations to order all customs offices nationwide to uniformly adopt the new system for all weighing instruments. This is hereby recorded and reported to Your esteemed authorities for review and approval, and we request that you promptly issue an order to comply, so that the new system of weights and measures can be promoted smoothly, which would be for the public convenience. Respectfully, Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce.</p>

<p>Towed Back to Hong Kong for Major Repairs</p>
<p>Cargo Transferred to Shanghai for Shipment to Tianjin</p>
<p>The Jardine Matheson-owned ship "Hengsheng" originally operated on the Shanghai-South China route but recently switched to the North-South routes, sailing directly from Hong Kong, Guangdong, Xiamen, and Shantou to Tianjin. On this trip from Hong Kong and Guangdong to Tianjin, the ship was fully loaded with passengers and cargo, with over 10,000 pieces destined for Tianjin. Unexpectedly, when the ship arrived in Xiamen, due to foggy weather, the navigation was careless and collided with another ship. The "Hengsheng" ship was hit, and the iron plates on the outer hull were ruptured. The damage was also below the waterline. Although there was no major breach, it was no longer able to sail. For the sake of safe navigation and passenger safety, the company immediately suspended the voyage and unloaded the cargo and passengers in Xiamen, arranging for another ship to transport them to Tianjin. The "Hengsheng" ship was towed back to Hong Kong for major repairs. All 10,960 pieces of cargo destined for Tianjin were transferred to Shanghai yesterday and will be reloaded onto the "Dingsheng" ship this morning for shipment to Tianjin.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Bandits Collude with Japanese Ronin to Commit Robbery <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Pre-arranged Automobile Waits at Bank Entrance</p>
<p>Fortunately, Escort Personnel Did Not Arrive; Bandits Dispersed</p>
<p>Police Arrested Them, Handed Over to Court for Interrogation Yesterday</p>
<p>On August 14th, a certain traveler planned to deposit a large sum of money at the Bank of China on Huangpu Road. This matter was learned by bandits Shi Ruichang from Tongzhou and Xu Fengqing from Shanghai. They colluded with Japanese ronin Nishi Eiichi and Hosoya Naoto, explaining their plan to rob the large sum of money. After reaching an agreement, they also invited Hu Hanshan from Haimen, who could drive a car. Thus, at around 8 a.m., the two Japanese each prepared a pistol, lead wire, and towel, and together with Shi and others, hired a car from the Far Eastern Company at No. 1 Pingliang Road, driven by driver Wu Songshan. When passing a remote area of Chunjiang Road under the jurisdiction of the 5th District of the Chinese area in Yangshupu, they ordered the car to stop. The group pulled out pistols, threatened Wu Songshan not to make a sound, stuffed his mouth with a towel, tied his hands and feet with lead wire, and threw him on the grass. Then, Hu Hanshan drove the car rapidly to the Bund on Fuzhou Road and parked, waiting near the bank. By noon, the traveler had not appeared. Fearing that the matter would be exposed and they would be arrested, they dispersed and fled. Driver Wu Songshan was found by a patrol officer at the scene, who untied him, took him to the 5th District Public Security Bureau, and interrogated him about the situation. He was then released. Wu immediately reported to the company, which in turn reported to the police for arrest. Although the Chinese and foreign authorities conducted a thorough investigation, they could not find any clues. The case stalled for a month until the other day, when the Hongkou police obtained confidential information from an informant about the bandits' hideout. Thus, Detective Shi Enjian and Inspector Wang Runhe went to 102 Zhexing Lane, Disui Road, at around 8 p.m. and arrested Shi Ruichang. Then, they went to 18 Haining Road and arrested Japanese ronin Nishi Eiichi, seizing a pistol loaded with six bullets from his person, and took him to the police station. The police chief ordered the two Japanese to be sent to the Japanese Consulate for interrogation, while Shi and others were detained. Yesterday morning, they were handed over to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Local Court. Judge Wu Zehan conducted the interrogation. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the case, saying that although the defendants confessed at the police station, the evidence in the case was still held at the 5th District Public Security Bureau and that accomplices needed to be arrested. He requested a postponement. Then, Wu Songshan, the car driver from the Far Eastern Company, testified that the defendants Shi Ruichang and others came to hire the car, and he drove it. Unexpectedly, when they reached a remote area in the Chinese area, Shi and others threatened him with guns, and the two Japanese tied him up with lead wire and stuffed his mouth with a towel, preventing him from making a sound. Shi confessed that Nishi Eiichi initiated the plan, the pistol was held by the Japanese, and after tying up Wu, they intended to rob the money. When they arrived at the Bund on the Fourth Road, they waited for a long time without success and dispersed. Three days before, they discussed the plan at the Japanese's place on Haining Road. Xu Fengqing confessed that he was invited by the Japanese to help. After verifying the confession, Wu ordered them to be detained and adjourned the hearing to investigate further.</p>

<p>Blocking Cargo Ships on the Caojiadu River</p>
<p>Arrest Those Who Rely on Numbers to Assault People and Rob Goods</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, in response to incidents of thugs blocking ships and extorting money or assaulting people and robbing goods in the Jidun area of Pujiatu Canal, sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting a prompt investigation and prohibition by the water patrol team. The original text reads: "To the esteemed Sirs, on the 14th of this month, we received a letter from the Municipal Local Goods Trade Association, stating that recently, in the Jidun area of the Caojiadu Canal, ships transporting local goods have been blocked by thugs and vagrants who extort money or rely on numbers to assault people and rob goods, causing great harm to merchants. They requested that measures be taken to stop this. In response, we believe that the act of vagrants robbing cargo ships and extorting money is a blatant disregard for the law. Therefore, we hereby request Your esteemed Association to promptly request the Public Security Bureau to order the water patrol team in that area to patrol and investigate day and night to suppress banditry and ensure safe transportation. The Pujiatu Canal in western Shanghai is located in a remote area, and if the police force is weak and unable to reach it, how would these people dare to be so reckless? This matter concerns the hindrance of the transportation of goods, and this trend must not be allowed to continue. We hereby request the Bureau to investigate and strictly prohibit those who rely on assaulting people, robbing goods, and extorting money and to apprehend them according to the law." It is heard that after reviewing the letter, the Bureau has already ordered each district and team to investigate and arrest those who rely on assaulting people, robbing goods, and extorting money and to handle them according to the law.

<p>List of Stolen Items Submitted to Police for Investigation</p>
<p>Chen Yiqin, a native of Wuxi, 45 years old, formerly operated the "Yiji Customs Brokerage" in the Weiwencheng area of Zilai Street in the French Concession. His business flourished, and he accumulated considerable savings over the years. Recently, he built more than a dozen shikumen houses in the Wujia Lane, Houjiabang Road, in the old North Gate city of the Nanshi area. Chen and his family live in No. 5, which is elegantly decorated and somewhat aristocratic, attracting the attention of bandits. At around 6:30 a.m. yesterday, five bandits, dressed in mismatched clothes and speaking the local dialect, suddenly appeared. One of them carried a pistol, while the other two held axes and daggers. The bandits used a trick, shouting "The chamber pot is overflowing!" Chen's maid, believing it to be true, opened the door, and the bandits rushed in, went straight to Chen's bedroom, and forbade her to make a sound. They robbed her of a set of jewelry, a gold locket, four gold rings with stones, two wedding gold rings, a fox fur coat, a gray squirrel female robe, and many other silk and satin clothes. Only a little over 100 yuan in cash was taken. After the robbery, the bandits carried the loot and left leisurely. The victim submitted a list of stolen items to the First Precinct of the Second District, requesting an investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e167">("Jing Bao") Yu Daxiong Sues ("Shiri Tan") Shao Xunmei <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Yu Daxiong, Director of Jing Bao, recently retained three lawyers, Dong Yu, Wang Yintai, and Tang Mingshi, to file a lawsuit with the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Local Court, accusing Shao Xunmei, the organizer of the tabloid Shiri Tan, of spreading rumors and damaging his reputation, requesting a strict investigation. The main points of the lawsuit are as follows: The defendant's Shiri Tan (a bi-weekly publication) published in its second issue an article titled "Zhu Jiqing Will Also Announce Donations," which stated in the latter part: "(The newspaper reported the other day that Mr. Zhu Ziqiao telegraphed General Li Du, citing Jing Bao's publication of Li's interview, which contained receipts issued by the volunteer army, showing that only 60% of the actual amount was received, and ridiculed it as a 'four-six split.' However, I believe that General Li would never make such a statement. It must be unfounded talk from a tabloid reporter, and the tabloid reporters in Shanghai are mostly worthless scumbags who often engage in extortion. The purpose of publishing this article is for this, not for that." Jing Bao's August 8th news report of the interview with General Li Du was sent by a responsible member of the newspaper and published with his name. General Li Du's telegram to Zhu Qingjia also confirmed this (see the Shanghai Times of August 17th). However, the defendant, in the Shiri Tan published on August 20th, arbitrarily asserted that there was no such interview, affirmed that it was unfounded talk from a reporter, scolded the reporter as a scumbag, falsely accused the newspaper of extortion, and presumed that the purpose of Jing Bao publishing this news was for this, not for that. The 'this' refers to extortion. This can be understood by reading the context. However, Jing Bao has been established for fourteen years. Although its size is smaller than that of major newspapers, it strives for accuracy and fairness in its news gathering and has never used it as a tool for extortion. Even regarding the donation of the volunteer army, it published General Li Du's interview and General Zhu's telegram (see Jing Bao of August 11th) and General Zhu's interview (see Jing Bao of August 19th). If there was even a slight intention of extortion, it would not have adopted such an impartial attitude. Now, the defendant knowingly made false accusations and intentionally did so, which constitutes the crime of aggravated defamation under Article 328 of the Criminal Code and the crime of damaging credit under Article 330 of the same law. He should be prosecuted for both crimes. As for the losses suffered, a separate lawsuit will be filed later." The court, based on the lawsuit, summoned the plaintiff Yu Daxiong and his lawyers to the Second Criminal Court at 11:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Judge Wu Fanglian. The defendant claimed illness and sent a lawyer to appear on his behalf. The lawyer stated that the plaintiff's age and address were unknown. According to the defendant's lawyer, the defendant requested a postponement due to illness and stated that the tabloid Shiri Tan was not organized by the defendant and that the subject of the plaintiff's accusation was incorrect. The plaintiff Yu Daxiong stated that the tabloid Shiri Tan was indeed organized by the defendant and that there were witnesses to prove this. After verifying the statements, the court adjourned and will summon the defendant for interrogation on a later date.</p>

<p>Eight Arrested and Sent to Court for Trial</p>
<p>Recently, robbery cases on the streets of Shanghai (commonly known as "stripping the pig") have become prevalent. A type of rogue youth, wearing blue cloth shirts or blue cloth robes, specifically form gangs and wait in secluded places for passersby. When a person passes by alone, they rush out and rob them. These gangs call themselves the "Blue Shirt Gang" and are led by a leader who distributes the loot. Such robberies often occur in the French Concession in the early morning and evening. Based on reports from victims, the police even received several cases in one day. Chief Detective issued an order to special agents to conduct a thorough investigation in an effort to eliminate the roots of evil and protect the good. At noon on the 15th, French police officers Yuan Zhonghe and Chen Lishun received a tip that a group of robbers would be passing through Jixiang Street on Avenue Edward VII at 1:00 PM to discuss committing a robbery somewhere.

<h3 id="e169">Hu Xiyuan Discusses the Current Situation of the Light Bulb Industry <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>Electric light bulbs are one of the emerging industries in my country in the last ten years. Since the January 28th Incident, many new factories have been established, but recently, many have been unable to sustain themselves. The truth of the matter is not well understood by the outside world. According to Hu Xiyuan, who is involved in the industry, the manufacture of electric light bulbs requires the expertise of chemical, electrical, and mechanical experts to produce fine products. In 1920, foreign merchants once fiercely competed, causing the market price to plummet. The domestic light bulb industry, except for one or two with thicker capital, barely struggled, and almost no one dared to try again. After the Shanghai war last year, the Chinese people felt a strong stimulus and purchased domestic goods in droves. As a result, the domestic light bulb supply could not meet demand, and enthusiastic people opened factories one after another to meet the needs of the Chinese people. However, during August and September of last year, Japanese bulbs were dumped in large quantities, and this year the market situation is not good, sales are sluggish, and some factories have temporarily stopped production to wait for the opportunity to reorganize. Before the Shanghai war, there were only four domestic light bulb factories, large and small. Now, there are fifteen, producing an average of about 60,000 to 70,000 ordinary bulbs per day. If they can unite, study each other, reduce costs, and improve products, there is hope for the future. Hu also stated that domestic light bulbs must work hard on equipment, raw materials, and production in order to set a low price within the possible range. If they only seek to reduce prices and produce shoddy goods, which leads to a loss of customer confidence, they will all perish together. Regarding the recent price drop of foreign bulbs, he said that it would only provoke Chinese resentment and was not a good policy.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern, On the 16th of this month, your newspaper published a message (China Merchants Steam Navigation Company shipping manager refuses to hand over the unloading, the bureau enforced it), saying that several associations expressed opposition. After checking, our association was not initially aware of this case, so the handling of the negotiation was entirely by the Shanghai Seamen's Union Temporary Steering Committee. Because the news report is inaccurate, we hereby request a correction. Please investigate. Sincerely, The Preparatory Committee of the Chinese Seamen's Union, September 16.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I read in yesterday's newspaper about the incident of wounded soldiers causing trouble at the station, the content of which included (fists and feet flying, even scolding and beating the police chief). The facts are far from the truth. At the time, the wounded soldiers wanted to cause trouble, but there was no use of force. However, the report has already published this message, and I am truly guilty, so I hereby send this letter, asking for a correction.

<p>Qianghua Beats Moore (Men's)</p>
<p>The basketball opening games, a total of three games for men and women, were held in the Chinese Basketball Hall starting at 7:00 PM. As the lights came on, men and women, dressed in red and green, flocked in, no less than four or five hundred people. Nanyang Commercial rose unexpectedly, giving Shanghai a major scare. Therefore, the situation was tense and the interest was high, making it one of the most important battles of the night. However, the result ultimately went to Shanghai. The other two games were one-sided. The results were: (1) Shanghai beat Nanyang Commercial 44-31, (2) Xia Guang beat Nanyang Commercial (Women's) 79-8, (3) Qianghua beat Moore 50-29. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e191">Shanghai Beats Nanyang Commercial (Men's) <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>The Nanyang Commercial basketball team has just returned from a tour of the Philippines. With the help of others, their skills have greatly improved. The wind-swept passing and soft, comforting shooting surprised Shanghai. They were temporarily at a disadvantage, but with a surge of energy, a second decline, and then exhaustion, Nanyang Commercial finally succumbed to Shanghai. The score was 31-43. Looking at the Nanyang Commercial team's talent, they are tall and average, with front and rear offense and defense complementing each other, holding great hope of resisting Shanghai. Therefore, a large number of supporters came to threaten Shanghai unexpectedly. Unfortunately, they lacked the spirit of long-term combat, leading to failure. In the first half, the Nanyang Commercial team was strong and accurate in shooting, with the score often above Shanghai, leading by four or five points, at most winning by 15-9. Under this severe situation, Shanghai worked hard to struggle and gradually achieved a 15-15 tie. Nanyang Commercial paused to find another way. Chen Jinzhi added two points for Nanyang Commercial, taking the lead again. But from then on, the Nanyang Commercial record stagnated. Shanghai's Feng Nianhua pounced like a mad tiger, hitting three balls. Qian Jingguo scrambled like a runaway rabbit, scoring one ball. The score was reversed, and Chen Jinzhi shot two more points for Nanyang Commercial. Lu Zhonghui created a 23-19 first-half situation. Shanghai led by four points. As the second half began, the Nanyang Commercial lineup was scattered and no longer as active as before. On the contrary, Shanghai was in full swing. The veteran Lu Zhongen made a comeback, replacing his younger brother on the court, making the lineup even more solid. Seeing good fortune upon entering, he scored the first ball. Zhao Xikang shot accurately from afar. Nanyang Commercial also scored two points, but the gain did not outweigh the loss. A cup of water could not save a cartload of firewood. Shanghai's momentum was overwhelming, and Wu Guolin's skills became more and more adept, scoring points repeatedly. By the last seven or eight minutes, the game was already set. The situation passed peacefully in a calm state. In the end, Shanghai won 44-31. Referee was Wu Jiatang.</p>

<p>The game between Qianghua and Moore was much less exciting than the previous one. Qianghua is the incarnation of John from Brahma Temple, all famous generals of the time.</p>
<p>In the first ten minutes of the game, they actually succumbed to Moore. Fortunately, the adjustment of Xu Wenkui turned the tide. Both sides charged straight in, attacking with long shots, especially shooting under the basket, which was rarely seen. Except for Xu Wenkui, all the shots were completely missed, which was very disappointing. After Chen Xianglong scored the first goal for Qianghua, Moore scored successively by Huang Yourui and Song Qifu, 3-2, 5-2, and then 7-2, taking the lead. Seeing that the situation was not good, Qianghua replaced Tao Nan with Xu Wenkui, gradually making it 10-11, still one point behind. At this time, Xu scored three consecutive goals, completing it in one breath, and Qianghua took the lead for the first time at 16-11. They took a four-point lead in the first half at 20-16. Starting in the second half, they maintained this situation. Qianghua gradually became more comfortable and eventually entered the second week with a score of 50-29. Referee was Shu Hong.</p>

<p>The women's basketball game was only between Xia Guang and Nanyang Commercial, and it was completely one-sided. In the end, Xia Guang won by a large margin of 79-8, a rare record in women's basketball. Xia Guang relied on two tall forwards, Liu Mali and Zhuang Lingzhao, to block the small Nanyang Commercial team, who could only sigh in admiration and let them do as they pleased. The record was first opened by Ye Yuzhu of Nanyang Commercial, and after 4-4, the entire game was in Xia Guang's hands. Two of the guards were penalized, and in the second half, Zeng, who was the movie star Li Lili, was replaced, which attracted much attention, but her skills were too poor, and Nanyang Commercial only scored one point in each of the two quarters. Liu Mali and Zhuang Lingzhao of Xia Guang scored 35 and 31 points respectively, and can be called strong players. Referees Shao Jinying and Shu Hong.

<p>Huahua Beats Southeast 6-0</p>
<p>Xingguang Beats Chenguang 9-2</p>
<p>Mediocre and Quietly Passed</p>
<p>Both soccer games were held at the baseball field. As a result, Huahua beat Southeast 6-0 and Xingguang beat Chenguang 9-2. The battle situation is briefly described below.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Huahua Beats Southeast <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>Huahua is the incarnation of Qinghua, such as Fu Zhibin, Zheng Zhiyun, Li Wenqing, etc., all of whom are emerging figures in soccer, and the teamwork of the entire team is very strong. Southeast is a combination of the Dongguang and Nanshe teams, and although their strength is not weak, their coordination is lacking. After the start of the war, Jiang Chao and Huang Guorong made contributions one after another. The third goal was a gift from the Southeast goalkeeper, who was seen by the referee turning around with the ball, so it was judged to be a goal. Jiang Chao and Fu Zhibin then made contributions. Southeast was under pressure from Huahua everywhere, and could hardly breathe. After Huang Guorong made it 6-0, Southeast was brutally eliminated.</p>

<p>Xingguang took the stage after Huahua and Southeast, and Xingguang was aggressive, with Hua Shaozhi and Li Dongliang scoring three goals in a row, their arrogance soaring. Before long, Xu Jingcheng sneaked in twice and achieved his goal, scoring the fourth goal. Chenguang launched several counterattacks and had a penalty kick opportunity, but failed to score, which was unlucky. Xu Jingcheng took the opportunity to advance again. Chenguang was discouraged a lot. Li Dongliang was unforgiving, breaking through with a single knife and scoring the fifth goal. After the break, Li scored two goals in a row with lightning speed, and Hua Shaozhi added fuel to the fire, completing a large score of 9-0 in one breath. Chenguang's three armies were angry and speechless. They launched a fierce counterattack, and Zhang Zhonghe broke out of the battle, regaining a fortress. Chen Boxian made another contribution in the midst of the raging waves, and their momentum was greatly strengthened. They intended to take back all the lost ground in one go, but time did not allow it, and the bell rang to end the game.</p>

<p>Today's Afternoon Match Against Shanghai University</p>
<p>The Hanzhong volleyball team arrived with great momentum. Since invading Shanghai, they first defeated Yinghua, then Dongya. Yesterday, they went to Zhongshan Road and defeated Datong in a clean sweep, with scores of 21-9, 26-24, and 21-16. In the first set, Datong was frequently pressured and had little to show. The second set was intense, with fierce competition. Both sides displayed high-pressure tactics, making it difficult to separate them, resulting in a large score of 26-24. In the third set, Hanzhong led all the way, and Datong tried hard to catch up but failed. Today at 4:00 PM, Hanzhong will play against Shanghai University at the China Football Field. Tomorrow, they will face the Jiangnan powerhouse Fudan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, China defeated England, winning the Shanghai International Tennis Doubles Championship Robber Cup for the fourth consecutive year. China's Qiu Feihai and Jiang Daozhang easily defeated England's Stokes and Colechu in straight sets, with scores of 6-0, 6-3, and 6-4. In the junior singles final, Ma Da defeated Forbes 6-2, 6-4, 6-4 to win the championship. The matches were all held at the French Chamber of Commerce. There were only over two hundred spectators, making it the day with the fewest spectators for the Robber Cup final in four years. This afternoon, the open advanced singles semifinals will be held at the same venue. All four participants are Chinese, making it the first time in the history of Shanghai tennis. They are Qiu Feihai vs. Yu Tianguang and Zheng Zhaojia vs. Wang Wenzheng. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e209">Junior Singles Championship - Ma Da's Excellent Performance <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Open Junior Singles Championship has been won by Chinese players since 1930. The first was Yu Tianguang, the second was Qian Wenshi, and the third was Sun Linfang. This year, there were four Chinese participants. Three were eliminated in the preliminary round. Guo Yujie, the only survivor, unfortunately lost to Ma Da in the semifinals, resulting in the championship being awarded to a foreigner this year. Yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM, Ma Da and Forbes held the final. Ma Da is a strong football player from Las, good at running. He controlled Forbes with ease. His shots and net play were skillful, and his attitude was generous, his swing was natural, skilled, and crisp, and he rarely made mistakes. He is truly a rare talent among new players, but his backhand and serve are relatively weak. Forbes lost three sets in a row, and Ma Da won the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e210">Robber Cup Doubles Match - Bland and Uninteresting <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The Grass Court Tennis Club's Robber Cup International Doubles Championship has been won by China for three years since 1930. In previous years, the stands at the French Chamber of Commerce court were always packed with spectators. However, this year's situation was far from what it used to be. There were only two or three hundred people, making it feel very desolate. The reason for this is that the two English players, Stokes and Colechu, are not top-notch, and China used the aging Jiang Daozhang and Qiu Feihai as a pair, which was not enough to attract spectators. Furthermore, after China narrowly defeated Japan in a five-set battle in the semifinals, it was thought that their final against the English pair, who had defeated the American pair Squire and Smith, would be unfavorable. However, in the match, the English players were mentally defeated, making unforgivable mistakes everywhere, allowing Qiu and Jiang to win three sets easily. This was unexpected, but the performance was bland and uninteresting.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Straight Set Victory <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>After the start, the description was light and simple.</p>
<p>The English players made frequent mistakes, and Qiu and Jiang scored again and again, winning six consecutive games with ease. The total score of each game was 26-11. In the second set, China slipped on Qiu's serve, but then took back Colechu's serve, then took the third game to make it 2-1. The English players showed some edge, applying high pressure and winning two consecutive games, 2-3. It was a flash in the pan, taking the lead. Afterwards, China completed four games in one go, ending at 6-3. The score was 31-25. In the third set, the second and eighth games were quite tense, with many ties. The eighth game had as many as six ties. China won the first two games, and England returned the favor with two games. China then won the fifth and sixth games in a row, and England fought hard to tie it again at 4-4. Qiu and Jiang added two more games to end the one-sided situation with a clean sweep of 6-4. The score for this set was 40-31. After the match, the chairman of the Grass Court Tennis Club, Grimmshaw, presented the award and the event ended.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Advanced Singles Semifinals - All-Chinese Affair <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Open Advanced Singles Semifinals, an all-Chinese affair, will be held at the French Chamber of Commerce starting at 2:30 PM this afternoon. The order is as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng vs. Zheng Zhaojia 2:30 PM</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai vs. Yu Tianguang 4:00 PM</p>
<p>In the previous China Open Singles Final, Wang Wenzheng defeated Zheng Zhaojia in five sets. This time, the two are meeting again in a different location, and the outcome is of great interest to the general public. However, Zheng's recent losses in the Youyou Cup have diminished his sharpness, which will affect today's match. Therefore, Wang Wenzheng has a better chance of winning. In the Qiu Feihai vs. Yu Tianguang group, Qiu is undoubtedly the favorite to win. However, considering Yu's sharpness in defeating Zheng Zhaojia in Youyou, he will surely give Qiu fierce competition.</p>

<p>The Pacific Ocean is the focus of contention among the great powers in the future, and Japan is undoubtedly a key player in the Pacific. Japan is a maritime nation, and the Japanese are a maritime people. The navy is of great importance to the country's destiny. It is essential for the Chinese people to understand the state of its navy and how it compares to other powers, especially the United States. The Navy of Japan, compiled by Sun Gongdu, is the best reading material to meet this need. The book details the history, geography, organization, personnel, administration, warships, air force, second defense line, and relationship with the Washington and London conferences of the Japanese Navy.

<p>Zheng Hongnian, Wang Xiaoying, and others, together with leaders from all walks of life, initiated the China Women's Middle School and recommended Ms. Wang Xiaoying to be responsible for the planning. The January 28th Incident occurred, and Ms. Wang was unable to leave her important duties in both Beijing and Shanghai for a time. This ideal women's middle school was not realized in time. This summer, the board of directors, considering that the school has been preparing for more than two years and that various circles in the city have been inquiring about it, decided to open the school this fall and recommended Ms. Wang Xiaoying as principal. It is reported that Ms. Wang is temporarily unable to shake off all her duties, so she has temporarily asked Ms. Xu Yuanpu, the former Zhejiang Education Department Commissioner, to be the acting principal. The school has also rented a building at the intersection of Fangxie Street and Linyin Road in Nanshi as the school building. The faculty and staff have also been fully appointed, and the curriculum management is strictly based. This year, only one first-year junior high school class will be offered, enrolling 50 students. A supplementary course will also be offered for students of high and junior high school levels, so that they can have the opportunity to improve their major subjects outside of regular class time. Registration begins today. The entrance exam will be held on the 29th. School starts on October 1st.</p>

<p>—Yang Shi</p>
<p>It is said that the one who bestows relics is God. He created the world in six days, using humanity as the mirror of all things, ordered them to be the masters of the Earth, and arranged the Earth perfectly so that humanity could live a fulfilling life, free from worry, strife, and plunder.</p>
<p>After six days, he opened his eyes and looked: Ah! This Earth has land, plants, water, fire, and minerals. (Ah! Good, you humans can now most happily enjoy this perfect gift. You can peacefully be yourselves.) He laughed and shouted, and then, on the seventh day, people began to commemorate and worship him, calling it the Sabbath, repeating week after week. He smiled slightly, enjoying these worships.</p>
<p>However, our God only opened his eyes wide at the time and looked, but did not carefully observe with his heart; perhaps he was eager to enjoy himself and immediately sought enjoyment after six days of exhaustion. So he only opened his eyes wide and thought everything was perfect, and he rested. Look, now, the land, plants, minerals... humans are fighting for them, fighting and struggling. Humans are bleeding, dying one by one. They cannot enjoy this perfect gift. They cannot be their peaceful selves.</p>
<p>Alas, God! Who taught you not to be careful at that time, so that the world you created with your own hands is now completely destroyed? The masters of the Earth, the spirits of all things, whom you ordered, are slaughtering each other. Slaughtering each other, you will have no time to worship you! Are you smiling slightly at this time? I think you must be standing in heaven in despair, mourning for this world. But now I only ask you, don't stand in despair to no avail. Please exercise your supernatural powers and remodel the world. Spend another day of energy, and another week of seven. Then, humanity will not bleed, and truly peacefully be human. Then come to worship you, sincerely worship you, and praise you forever.</p>

<p>— Yang Yuesheng</p>
<p>Most people in Shanghai like to wear leather shoes. If their finances allow, they will even try to wear a Western suit. Of course, Western suits are inseparable from leather shoes. However, some people like to wear a long robe over Western trousers, which is much more artistic and freehand. Of course, they are also inseparable from leather shoes.</p>
<p>Leather shoes and I have little connection, except on rainy days. Because my leather shoes are a slightly more advanced rough type than the 19th-century (hobnail boots), I am reluctant to wear them. I believe leather shoes are only useful on rainy days.</p>
<p>But I heard that imported leather shoes cannot withstand rain. On rainy days, rubber shoes must be put on. Isn't that not only funny but also quite troublesome? Is it not? Shanghai people are wealthy (and have a craze for leather shoes), and because leather shoes are popular, some people make a living by shining leather shoes. We know that women's eyes often first come into contact with men's feet. Of course, it is necessary to polish and shine leather shoes. Therefore, shoe-shiners are simply indispensable in Shanghai, so this profession has developed rapidly. However, it is a new and moving thing for an anti-Japanese hero to end up shining shoes in Shanghai!</p>
<p>We saw Mr. Jiang Minsheng's conversation with our reporter: (After anti-Japanese heroes arrive in Beijing and Shanghai, they often live in high-rise buildings, have plenty to eat and wear, travel by car, have servants like clouds, sometimes go to Mogan Mountain, sometimes to Suzhou and Hangzhou, and behave extravagantly, which is heartbreaking!) My childish heart died long ago! I don't feel pain, but my head is unusually swollen. But when I think that there are still people who don't admire vanity, don't go to Mogan Mountain, don't live in foreign-style houses, don't ride in cars, and make a living by shining shoes with their own hands, I get excited. I can still see a faint glimmer of dawn in front of me!</p>
<p>Shanghai is a place where Chinese and foreigners live together. I imagine for Mr. Jiang that if he were shining shoes on a Japanese person's feet, it seems unnecessary to apply oil because tears can wash away the dust on the leather shoes. As long as your hands don't tremble, a few wipes will do the job.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are young heroes shining shoes, and in Liaoning, there are sixty-year-old old teachers being forced to wipe the floor bare-chested. (The Liaoning correspondence of this newspaper on the 5th casts a sigh in contrast!</p>

<p>— Qian Yun writes, Wen Dongliang draws</p>
<p>The alleys are not peaceful. It is said that monsters are causing trouble, and all living people should do their best to bribe ghosts. So some contribute money, and others contribute effort. Mrs. So-and-so quickly wrote down a donation of ten yuan for her beloved grandson Fu Guan's recovery from illness. Even more wonderful and unpredictable is that Mr. So-and-so donated two yuan due to repeated defeats at mahjong, doing business with ghosts, making a great joke.</p>
<p>Who is the monster? Heaven knows, the dead understand, and some people say more frankly: I don't know how many people directly or indirectly maintain their livelihoods for the sake of the Taiping Public Sacrifice. This is still an invisible righteous act. Moreover, most Chinese people, except for this kind of occasion, are willing to spend money so readily. Enough said, then the donors are of course fools, and those who investigate the roots are even more fools. It seems right, but it is not; it seems wrong, but it is right.</p>
<p>If the public sacrifice is effective, I would like to use it to build thirty-three heavens for this society and this country. Wouldn't that be truly immeasurable merit?</p>
<p>Without the popularization of education, don't even think about eradicating things like the Taiping Public Sacrifice!</p>
<p>imported goods feel unwearable, so (British leather) indeed has considerable appeal in Shanghai, and the leather shoe industry is therefore</p>

<p>— Yan</p>
<p>China's transportation can be considered the most complex. And its conservatism is also very strong. Unless forced by the environment, and unable to avoid being backward, one can still see objects from thousands of years ago coexisting with scientific things in the big cities. Like Shanghai's (one bright moon,) its age is at least four thousand years old. Emperor Huangdi created it, or it already had this appearance. It may not have undergone much improvement to this day. But it actually runs alongside the most modern, ever-changing things like trams and cars on flat, smooth asphalt roads. Why aren't we surprised? For example, if someone wearing a square scarf and a monk's robe walks with a friend in a Western suit, what are our feelings? The world is so big, there is nothing strange. The difficulties of inland transportation are even unimaginable to people in Shaoshi. My friend Mr. Jin Lüqin, when he went to Changsha, saw rickshaws in Yiyang with huge canopies that also included the rickshaw puller, like the "oiled carriage" described by ancient poets. If it rains, it is very practical, and the puller will not become a drowned chicken, but it feels a bit bulky.</p>
<p>That's not even strange. Strange things are everywhere, but here it's very different. Because there is no bridge over the Zi River, they must take a ferry. They are riding in cars, of course, they cannot drive straight across, so they have to put them on a ferry to cross over. We remember that somewhere in the United States, trains are driven onto ships to cross rivers. Who knew that the ancient country of the East also has something similar. That Mr. Jin said that he had taken a mountain tram and a cable tram, but this was his first time seeing a car crossing a river, so his poetic inspiration exploded, and he wrote a poem: (Yiyang's mountains and rivers are naturally beautiful, especially with the perfumed carriage and low oil curtains; the most thought-provoking part is when the car crosses the river by ferry.) I heard that Hunan Province also has wood-burning cars and alcohol-fueled cars, so Shanghai, which has everything, is inevitably ashamed of this.</p>

<p>Zhao Ziqiang looked at him like that, and couldn't help but feel a strange itch in his heart, so he smiled at him too. Just at this moment, a group of people were walking on the road, and Zhao Ziqiang realized that he shouldn't reveal any flaws in front of people, so he turned around and hurried away. Guizhi leaned against the door frame and stood still, staring blankly at Zhao Ziqiang's departing figure, thinking foolishly. After a while, Mrs. Jiang came out from inside and said to her, "Oh, I didn't look for you enough inside. What are you doing standing at the gate alone?" Guizhi said, "Am I always locked up in the house all day long? I should also come out for some fresh air!" Mrs. Jiang laughed, "Oh! Our young lady is really full of new ideas and can actually say 'come out for some fresh air'." Guizhi said, "The phrase 'fresh air' is very common! What's so new about it?" While Mrs. Jiang was talking to her daughter, her eyes were watching the pedestrian road. She saw large leather shoe prints on the dirt road, going out from her own gate. She thought to herself, "Isn't this Zhao Ziqiang walking away, leaving these footprints?" She knew her own daughter, although she wasn't very stubborn, she wasn't like the female students who talked about love and freedom. Now, seeing this situation between her and Zhao Ziqiang, it was almost the same as talking about love. According to the fashionable people nowadays, couples who have gone through love are a perfect marriage. Looking at it this way, her future daughter and son-in-law will also be a perfect couple. She was always worried that her daughter wouldn't find a good son-in-law, but now it seems that there's no need to worry about her daughter. Mother and daughter stood at the door, staring blankly at the road leading west, a little dazed. Just then, Mama Liu, whom both mother and daughter approved of, happened to pass by the gate and said with a smile, "The weather is still cool, but you two are standing at the door." Mrs. Jiang and her daughter couldn't explain why they were standing at the gate. (189)</p>

<p>Children's Paradise – Patriotic Young Boys and Girls</p>
<h3 id="e237">Italian Boy <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>The Italian Prime Minister often said to the Boy Scouts: "If you want the country to be strong, it all depends on you young people. You know that there was a boy who died for the country." This boy was named Barilla. Today, the Boy Scouts throughout Italy are named after Barilla. Originally, the Italian Boy Scouts were divided into junior groups, boy groups, girl groups, and young women's groups. In addition to general education, physical education, and moral education, there were also military education, lectures, mountain forest solitary living, and overseas travel by ship. This is Italy's fundamental cultivation of military-national education, which is indeed unmatched by other countries.</p>
<p>Speaking of Barilla, this boy, sixty-three years ago, when the Austrian army occupied the Italian village of Genqva, armed enemy soldiers rampaged unchecked. At that time, Barilla was very concerned, secretly shedding tears and sighing. One day, enemy soldiers pushed cannons through the streets. The wheels of the cannon carriage suddenly sank into the mud. The enemy officer wanted the people on the street to help him lift the wheels, but the people of Genqva hated that their homeland had been occupied by the enemy and refused to help. The enemy soldiers shouted: "Damn slaves of a fallen country, if you don't obey orders, you will lose your lives." Among them, an officer wearing high-topped leather shoes kicked a villager indiscriminately. Barilla, who was in the crowd, was burning with anger and could no longer bear it. He loudly scolded the officer: "You beast, you are so tyrannical and rude. I wouldn't be content even if I ate your flesh." After saying that, he picked up a fist-sized stone, aimed at the officer's head, and threw it forcefully. The officer suffered a serious injury, and two or three soldiers guarding him immediately fired their guns wildly. Barilla fell to the ground, but unable to get up, he still endured the pain and scolded the officer to death. Thereupon, the whole village shouted Barilla's name: "Barilla, Barilla! We will avenge you!" They scattered and returned home. Even the women at home came with knives and axes, like a raging tide. Seeing the situation was bad, the Austrian army quickly abandoned the cannons and fled out of the village. After this news spread, the people of Italy were filled with righteous indignation. They followed Barilla's patriotic example and rose up one after another, forming a national salvation army to counterattack the Austrian army. The Austrian army was defeated in successive battles. It had no choice but to propose peace. As a result, Italy, which had been a colony of Austria, became an independent country.</p>

<p>During the Russo-Japanese War, there was a sixteen-year-old girl named Ota Akiko. Her father was a platoon leader. The night before he set off, he returned home to say goodbye to his family. The next day, he left in a hurry. At this time, Akiko had already resolved to die with her father, but because her mother was still alive, she dared not say it openly. Half a month later, her father sent a letter back, saying that he had led his troops to Busan and would soon go to the front line to fight. After reading the letter, Akiko secretly left home and became a nun. She took a train to the Northeast overnight, disguised as a female beggar, and sneaked into the vicinity of the Russian headquarters. Coincidentally, a Russian officer was patrolling outside the camp gate. Seeing that the girl was beautiful, he had evil intentions and took her into the camp. At this time, Japanese Combined Fleet Commander Togo Heihachiro took his flagship Mikasa to Korea. The soldiers of the Second Division had already landed at Zhennampo. Akiko learned the news in the camp and secretly reported the situation in the Russian army to the headquarters of General Kuroki of the Japanese First Army on the Yalu River. As a result, the initial conflict between the Japanese and Russian armies, thanks to Akiko's report, resulted in a great victory for the Japanese army. At the same time, the Russian fleet, which was hindering the Japanese army's plan, was also completely leaked by Akiko. The Japanese army was then able to blockade Port Arthur and cut off the Russian army in Port Arthur and Liaoyang. The Russian army was coerced at both ends and had no intention to fight. Akiko heard that the Japanese army had gained the upper hand and escaped from the Russian camp. She then reported the Russian army's battle situation to the Japanese army. The Japanese army quickly connected the First, Second, Fourth, and Third Armies, echoed each other, and defeated the Russian army's commander-in-chief Kuropatkin's army, occupying the forts behind Port Arthur. At this point, the Russian army was unable to cope. The garrison commander Stoessel begged General Nogi of the Japanese army for peace. This is the reason why Japan won the war against Russia. Later, Akiko died of illness on the way. Her father was promoted to major general for her merit in scouting enemy intelligence. These inside stories are deeply avoided in Japan's official history. However, in Japan's Yasukuni Shrine, there is still a position for a national protection goddess, and women often talk about this story.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Financial Gold Prices Turn Stable <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>

Gold Exchange forward silver prices contracted by 0.015 and 0.03 points respectively, London spot gold also rose by 11 pence, US cotton and wheat rose slightly, and stocks fell by 2.03 yuan. People's hearts were thus stabilized. The opening gross price was as high as 967 yuan. Although it fell later, the increased spread was calculated on the advanced price from the long side, still rising after the retreat. After the opening, it rose due to the good digestion of banks. Subsequently, the banks took advantage of the high prices to supply. Reuters reported that Holland denied the 1929 covenant to abolish all trade import and export bans, because this move could enable it to fully govern its own economic policy. There was then a rumor in the market that the French gold standard was in danger. The foreign exchange and gold markets turned sharply downward, and there were various rumors of a US inflation bill. However, this was discussed in Reuters' weekly report on the New York Stock Market, and there was no shadow. When the gold price broke through the 90 yuan barrier, those covering short positions were eager, and the banks took advantage of the low prices to vigorously buy. At noon, the situation turned around. The offered price was added to 280 yuan. The mid-day market situation is recorded below: The morning opening was 792 yuan, which was higher than the previous closing. If a spread of 8 yuan is added, it rises by approximately 5.3 yuan. Goods opened at 2.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market opened with a recent selling price of 1 shilling 3 pence 375 for the British exchange rate and 30 yuan for the US exchange rate. At first, it hovered. Later, Mitsui bought US dollars for January at 875, and Fuyu, Hengyu, and Hengxing all advanced. Retail investors vigorously raised the price. The Yokohama Specie Bank bought US dollars for January at 8115. Although Yuanmao, Yongzhi, and Fengyong sold, they were still able to rise. It was learned in advance that HSBC's listing shilling fell by 125, and the US exchange rate did not move. Shanghai bought US dollars for January at 75. Yuanmao, Qianchangxiang, and others bought aggressively, rising to 6.5 yuan. Citibank offered half a yuan for December and fell slightly. Hengyu, Zhifengyong, Yuanshengyong, and Tongyi advanced again. Shanghai bought US dollars for January at 75, and Citibank bought 25 for November, then rising to 7.4 yuan. China-Belgium Bank and HSBC offered 375 US dollars for December, Shunli and Neixing sold, and gradually went downstream. Foreign news was unfavorable, and the foreign exchange market gradually loosened. Mitsui offered 4375 US dollars for December, and soon offered half a yuan again. Many retail investors sold off one after another. Qianchangxiang and Hengyu also sold. China-Belgium Bank offered 5625 US dollars for December, then falling to within 1 yuan. Bingxing vigorously bought. At this time, there was a slight struggle, but people's hearts were even more tired and the news was still bad. Qianchangxiang, Hongxing, Hengxing, Yuan, Yuanmao, and Yong all came to sell off, breaking through 90 yuan and falling to 88.8 yuan.

As a result, it rose by 4.6 yuan compared to the previous closing (plus a spread of approximately 8 yuan for the long side).</p>
<p>The announced price was due to the fact that HSBC Bank's US dollar listing did not move, still at 29.275 yuan, which combined for a gold price of 817 yuan. According to the closing price, it was approximately 25 yuan below, which was more than 2 yuan lower than the previous closing. The registered prices for this month were 805 yuan, 799 yuan for October, and 791 yuan for November. The morning supplementary water was 805 yuan, and the offered price was added to 280 yuan. There were not many transactions. Although there were buyers outside 1090 yuan, the Tianjin gang sold a small amount of spot goods, adding 295 yuan to the offered price, for 1087 yuan.

<p>丨Slight Price Declines: Slight Increase in Trading丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, trading was slightly less, and fluctuations remained minimal. Initially, there were threats from the Japanese, leading to selling pressure. Rumors circulated that the government would issue new public bonds, causing market sentiment to initially weaken and prices to drop slightly. Subsequently, due to stronger demand, prices recovered somewhat. Ultimately, the market remained in a confused and uncertain state, hovering without a clear direction. The trend appeared to be weakening. At the opening in the morning, sentiment was relatively weak, and various syndicates made slight gains, leading to a rebound. After the afternoon opening, the market returned to chaos, with prices fluctuating up and down, but only by very small amounts. Several types of stocks closed steady without any changes.

<p>A report from the Sino-Foreign Trading Company stated that the New York stock market opened higher on the 15th, but subsequently fell sharply due to large-scale selling. The cause of the decline was not immediately apparent, possibly triggered by rumors that France would abandon the gold standard. Foreign exchange rates fluctuated greatly, with speculation being more active than ordinary trading. The downward trend appeared to be nearing its end. The total daily trading volume was 2,450,000 shares. Wheat was in strong demand due to rising exchange rates. Cotton faced headwinds due to October long positions being liquidated and Southern hedging. The transfer of large sums by the Financial Rehabilitation Corporation and the National Recovery Program suggested that the government would not make any changes to its current monetary policy. The silver market was mixed and uncertain. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market fell in the morning but rebounded in the afternoon, remaining weak. The deterioration of the overall environment and the spread of rumors caused widespread anxiety. Merchants claimed that there were no practical solutions for the yarn market, leading sellers to aggressively dump their holdings. Many floating positions were abruptly liquidated. In the afternoon, news that a key figure in the national government would broadcast a message emphasizing efforts to maintain Chinese industry caused a slight stir in the market.</p>

<p>Sichuan 10 Inland 210 Shantou 5</p>
<p>Wuhu 10 Peers 165 Changsha 20</p>
<p>The cotton market initially fell but then rebounded, remaining weak. Panic reached extreme levels due to numerous rumors circulating in the market, claiming that a large batch of US cotton would soon be shipped to Shanghai by the national government and sold at low prices. This triggered a sudden wave of selling. The trading floor was filled with calls to sell, while buyers, fearing the volatile situation, hesitated to enter the market. However, Yuan Da continued to aggressively buy and add to their positions. Overall, the weather was favorable, but the yarn market remained sluggish, and speculative activity was limited. However, the number of sellers was increasing daily, and the accumulation of chips by both sides suggested that there would be significant changes in the future.</p>

Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 2 points. The Bombay cotton market was firm due to excessive rainfall and damage to Oomra cotton.

<h3 id="e252">US Cotton Is Driven Up by Inflation Concerns <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>丨The Situation Over the Past Week丨</p>
<p>A telegram from New York on the 15th reported on the cotton market over the past week, stating that the cotton market had turned upward due to renewed talk of inflation. Brisk cloth trading and strong wheat and bond markets contributed to improved sentiment in the futures market, which in turn increased demand for spot cotton. Reports of damage to the new crop and increased boll weevil activity were attributed to recent rains. Statistics suggest that the position of cotton is gradually strengthening, as authorities are currently planning to manage next season's cotton production, reportedly limiting acreage to 25 million acres. Based on the average production over the past decade, the harvest is expected to be around 8.8 million bales. Japanese traders are still procuring cotton in the Southwest. Currently, raw cotton prices are quite firm, but conservatives remain cautious, fearing a slight increase in the movement of new cotton.</p>

<p>Branded Flour Hits New Low Price</p>
<p>The flour market is in a state of irreversible decline, with prices continuing to fall. This month, prices suddenly fell by 2.2 yuan, reaching a low of 2.1925 yuan. Distant contracts were pressured by imported flour and wheat, and various factories aggressively sold, exacerbating the decline. The price of 2.1925 yuan for this month is a newly discovered low. This is due to the current ample supply of flour, sluggish actual sales, stagnant stockpiling, and added new short positions. Manufacturers have no choice but to sell standards to hedge their positions. Buyers can only wait for opportunities. News from Tianjin indicates that standard brands have fallen to 2.29 yuan. Local inventory is high, and sales are slow, making packaging and shipping unprofitable. The closing prices were down 1.5 cents for this month, down 1.75 cents for next month, down 1.25 cents for October, down 2 cents for December, down 1.5 cents for January, and down 2.25 cents for February.</p>
<h3 id="e254">Wheat Futures: Major Players Contend to Exit the Market <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>The wheat market saw imported wheat rise by about 10 cents. Spot wheat supply and inventory were both low, which supported market stability. However, a major player unwound their long positions, while new short sellers sold distant months, anticipating that the dumping of imported wheat and the arrival of borrowed wheat would lead to changes in the market. They sought to exit their positions early to achieve their goals. As a result, various parties covered their short positions after the opening, and prices for all months rebounded by 1-2-3 cents. In the afternoon, competition between major players and new shorts caused the market to suddenly fall again. However, prices for this month did not decline as much as distant months due to the tight spot wheat supply. The closing prices were unchanged for this month, down 1 cent for October and November, and down 5 cents for December and January. The opening price for spot wheat was higher. Fuxin purchased 4,000 bags of wheat from Gaoyou and Yangzhou at the previous market price.</p>
<h3 id="e255">River Hulls Rice Prices Remain Downstream <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's supply came from over forty firms, with limited transactions. Purchase appetite remained at only over 800 bags. Prices for various types of rice, including thick japonica, thin indica, Doyang pointed, and new pointed, continued to decline slightly, and transactions in silver dollars also showed signs of weakening. Prices for new river bottom japonica and new factory Dong rice remained stable. Fragrant japonica also showed no change.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday's supply came from thirty-three or thirty-four firms. The market showed a decrease in appetite for all types of rice. The morning market continued to decline, while the afternoon market was sluggish. Prices for broken white japonica, white round, early thin indica, new and old port pointed, and new and old guest pointed rice were stable. Old Yang Doyang pointed rice showed signs of weakening. Prices for East and West new japonica rice were stable.</p>
<h3 id="e256">New Guest Indica Rice Slowly Ascending <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>High-Quality Rice Demanding Higher Prices...Min-Style Flavors Very Strong</p>
<p>Yesterday's guest indica rice market saw Min-style buyers maintain their appetite, but the market had slightly stabilized. After several days of price increases, there had been some activity from guest buyers. Apart from a small batch of newly arrived Hunan rice, there were also sporadic shipments arriving en route. However, current inventory in the market was low, especially for high-quality rice. Therefore, sellers were uniformly demanding higher prices for high-quality Hunan rice, close to one jiao. Importers found the price increase too steep and were unwilling to trade. Two new Jing varieties were not traded due to unsuccessful price negotiations. Only the local street merchants bought 104 bags of the second Jing variety at a price of 6.12 yuan per bag. Quanzhou merchants bought 500 bags of rough Jing rice at a price of 5.75 yuan per bag, which was of higher quality but was 5 cents higher than the previous day. More than 1,000 bags of Nanjing machine-milled rice were purchased by Fuzhou and Quanzhou buyers at a price of 6.56 yuan to 6.50 yuan, which was 1-2 fen higher than the previous day. Lower-quality rice sold for 6.34 yuan and up. Yong-style buyers purchased 210 bags of old Jiangxi machine-milled late rice at a price of 7.40 yuan, which was 5-6 fen higher than the previous week. The market has temporarily stabilized. Future trends will depend on the arrival of supplies and market absorption. There were still no transactions involving foreign rice due to disagreements between the two sides.</p>

<p>The strike by silk mill workers in New York City has not been fully resolved, leading to a significant decrease in raw silk consumption and a sharp increase in inventory. Yesterday's telegram from New York stated that the city's total silk inventory had reached over 63,800 bales, of which Japanese silk accounted for slightly less than 50,000 bales, and Chinese silk accounted for only over 5,800 bales.</p>
<h3 id="e259">The Artificial Silk Market Turns Flat and Weak <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>The sales of artificial silk have come to an end. Yesterday, the market turned quiet. Only the local silk merchants purchased 30 boxes of Peacock, One Tree, and Liu Hai brands for immediate and future delivery at prices ranging from 176.25 yuan to 169.75 yuan net.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Foreign Firm Silk Sales Remain Difficult <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>With the US dollar exchange rate increasing, New York silk prices showed an apparent increase but a hidden flatness. Prices in England and France remained flat and weak. Foreign silk telegrams continued to be sent out yesterday morning, and confirmation is expected next week. Yesterday, only Dachang and others purchased 20 bales of Huangbai factory silk at flat and weak prices.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Gongxi Green Tea Exports to Russia Are Strong <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market in Shanghai saw strong interest from the Russian Cooperative Foreign Firm for Gongxi green tea from Wuyuan and Tunxi. Over a thousand boxes were traded in the city at a top price of 68 yuan, which was slightly firmer than before. The production of Gongxi tea in the Tunxi region has largely shifted to the production of needle-shaped and fine-eyebrow teas for export, resulting in a significant reduction in the quantity of Gongxi tea available. As a result, the market inventory is exceptionally low, with a supply shortage. In addition, there was also some activity in the European sales of earth tea, precious eyebrow tea, and pearl tea yesterday, but the market trend continued to decline.</p>

<p>Sales of Longkou noodles have been slow recently, and market prices have weakened. Guest buyers were offering 19 yuan, and local prices were also easing. According to a letter, the price per bag was 24.56 yuan, similar to the Shanghai opening price. Yesterday, market traders were selling at 19 yuan, and southern traders were selling at 18.5 yuan. The market was flat and weak.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the delivery of peanut oil goods arrived. Given the current sluggish market conditions, it was difficult to push prices higher. Sales in various regions were gradually decreasing, and the low price of sesame oil further contributed to the price decline. Yesterday, prices fell by another 3 cents. A total of 300 pieces of warehouse-grade oil were sold at a price of 14.7 yuan, and 50 pieces of Boer oil were sold at a price of 15 yuan.</p>

<p>After white tung oil from Hankou was sold by foreign firms for 25 yuan per dan, there were still few transactions, leaving the market unchanged. Prices in the southern branches of the trade were also around 20 yuan. There had been little change for a week. However, yesterday there was a sudden telegram from Hankou stating that the market had undergone a drastic change, with foreign firm oil trading at 26 yuan, a sudden increase of one yuan. It is likely that foreign firms had made large purchases, indicating a rapid shift in market sentiment. Zhejiang tung oil has traditionally followed the Hankou market. In recent days, Hangzhou traders have been selling in Shanghai, but upon hearing of the change in the Hankou market, they all returned to Hangzhou. As a result, Hangzhou buyers were absent from the Shanghai market today. The inventory of local firms in Shanghai was already low. As a result, those needing to purchase oil have been sending telegrams to both Hankou and Hangzhou.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Piece Goods: Broadcloth and Serge Prices Fluctuate <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Broadcloth and serge are needed for making Chinese and Western-style suits and overcoats. The market is currently in the selling season. Local merchants and guest buyers are making purchases, but prices are fluctuating. For example, Kongshi's 1005 brand is selling at a net price of 8.1 yuan due to limited supply, and there are many buyers competing to purchase it. Deji's 1005 brand is selling at 7.85 yuan less commission due to ample inventory, but sales are sluggish, and buyers are seeking to lower the price. The second-best brand, Haohua, is selling at 6.5 yuan, also up 2 cents. Most other brands range from 6 yuan to 7.56 yuan. Japanese goods are only selling for 4.25 yuan.</p>

<p>Ribbed steel bars are an essential item for the construction industry. Recently, the industry has shown strong buying interest. The market inventory has been almost completely depleted, and standard bars are becoming scarce and popular due to rolling shortages. The price has reached about 110 yuan per ton, which is 2-3 yuan higher than before. However, overseas prices have been very firm recently, so it is unlikely that the Shanghai market will ease in the short term.</p>

<p>Over the past two days, gangs from Qingdao and Yantai have been purchasing old iron goods such as foreign silver heads and foreign square heads in the market. They have purchased a total of 3,000 to 4,000 dan of these items, causing prices to rise by 1-2 cents. Recently, gangs from Fujian and Chaozhou, seeing the Shandong gangs' purchases, have also been aggressively buying, so the upward trend in market prices is just beginning and shows no sign of slowing.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Miscellaneous: Rice and Flour Are Shipped North and South Daily <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>(Yangtze River) There were very few imports yesterday, with only a small amount of tung oil. Exports included only over 700 pieces of piece goods and cotton yarn, over 2,000 bags of flour, and over 1,000 bags of sugar, which were shipped to Jiujiang and Hankou. However, it is said that since the January 28th Incident, sugar has been shipped exclusively by Japanese ships, either directly or after being transferred. Therefore, the amount shipped from Shanghai to the Yangtze River is very small. However, piece goods are also likely to have some Japanese goods mixed in.</p>
<p>(Northern Ports) Shipments from Shanghai to northern ports have been dominated by flour, rice, and other food products. Since the invasion, the poor market conditions in the north have led to low prices, which have negatively impacted grain merchants in Shanghai, especially flour merchants. As a result, guest buyers have stopped purchasing. Although a large batch of flour has been shipped to the north recently, it has been shipped by manufacturers themselves for market power reasons, absorbing the losses themselves. Yesterday's shipments to Tianjin included over 35,000 bags of flour and over 5,000 bags of rice. Another 25,000 bags are being shipped out today. The ports of Niuzhuang, Dalian, and Andong are all controlled by Japanese merchants, so there are no further shipments of piece goods and cotton yarn on Chinese and British ships. Imports yesterday included only 1,000 loads of soybean oil from Yingkou. The rest were all scattered.</p>
<p>(Southern China) Buyers from Guangdong and Shantou, seeing that there was a good harvest of rice, have been directly chartering ships to Wuhu to purchase rice. Yesterday, a ship from Niuzhuang departed, and another ship from Ningbo is waiting to depart. Therefore, shipments from Shanghai included only piece goods, cotton yarn, paper, peanuts, and a small amount of flour. Fuzhou was once affected by rumors of Red bandits, and guest buyers temporarily stopped purchasing. The situation has now improved. Today, over 10,000 pieces of flour, rice, paper, hardware, and other miscellaneous goods are being shipped out on the Wanyang ship. Guangdong also received over 2,000 bags of peanuts and over 300 pieces of piece goods and cotton yarn this morning.</p>

<h3 id="e269">On Attitude <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Huiyin</p>
<p>Regarding any matter, people always have an attitude. For example, now that autumn has arrived, some people will express a favorable impression of it, some will express a negative impression of it, and some will have no feeling about it. Those who express a favorable impression will praise it, saying how beautiful it is; those who express a negative impression will criticize it, saying how desolate it is; those who have no feeling about it will say nothing about it, letting it come naturally and letting it go naturally. Praising it is an attitude, criticizing it is also an attitude, and saying nothing about it is also an attitude.</p>
<p>If you are someone who praises autumn, those who criticize autumn may criticize you. If you are clear about your own views, you will not change your attitude of praising it because of that criticism. Vice versa.</p>
<p>If you are someone who has no feeling about autumn, you may be dissatisfied by both those who praise it and those who criticize it. If you still feel nothing about autumn at that time, you can only listen, just as you let autumn come naturally and let it go naturally.</p>
<p>However, if you are a clever person, you don't have to be so rigid, you can be more flexible: when you see that there are many people who praise autumn, you can also praise it a little; if there are few, you can take the opportunity to criticize it. That way you will always be one of the majority, which means you will always be the victor.</p>
<p>Or you may have your own views, for example, you may criticize autumn, but you don't want to admit it openly when you see that there are many people who praise it, because those who are willing to admit it openly are definitely not clever people. However, when you see someone praising autumn, you always feel unconvinced, you always want to say a few words of criticism. You know that you can't say these words directly, you have to be indirect, using them to divert people's attention. You might say, he, that person who praises autumn, doesn't even have the money to buy mooncakes, how is he worthy of praising autumn? After the reaction comes, you can shift the words a little, saying, not being able to eat mooncakes is his own business, why should he come looking for you? Or tell him how to get the money to buy mooncakes.</p>
<p>That way, people can't see your attitude clearly, and may eventually be unable to cope, or unwilling to cope, so you can watch yourself become the victor.</p>

<p>Song Muzhong (Yunlang Anecdotes) also records: Li Yuhuang Guojin was so poor that he had no money to buy books. Every day, he would take the printing blocks of Confucian classics and histories, caress and read them, making his fingernails black. Over time, he became fluent and became a famous Confucian scholar of his time. Yuhuang was very poor, living in a temple, with only one meal a day. Many nights when there was no fire, he and two old servants would sit together wrapped in worn-out fur coats. Such a scholar (taking printing blocks and caressing them while reading) is truly rare.</p>
<p>(6)</p>
<p>Qian Sigong of the Song Dynasty was born into wealth and could only read. His time allocation for reading was the most interesting. According to him, he would "read classics and histories when sitting, read novels when lying down, and read short lyrics when in the toilet." He was never willing to put down his book. Ouyang Yongshu recorded this. The same record also says that Song Gongchui, when in the History Academy, always carried a book with him when he went to the toilet, and the sound of his reciting could be heard far and wide. As for Yongshu himself, all his articles were written "on the three [places]," namely "on horseback," "on the pillow," and "in the toilet."</p>
<p>(7)</p>
<p>Speaking of Ouyang Yongshu, I thought of Su Dongpo. A few months ago, I read Li Rihua's (Zitaoxuan Miscellany) from the Ming Dynasty, which had an entry about Dongpo copying books. The (Miscellany) says that Dongpo once copied a complete copy of (The Book of the Two Hans). When he finished copying, he was so happy that he boasted that he was like a poor man who had suddenly become rich. Dongpo's high regard for books can be imagined from this. After the (Miscellany) describes this, it expresses the sentiment: Nowadays, people buy printed books, filling entire rooms, yet they do not read them, or they do not read them carefully. Books increase day by day, but learning decreases day by day, and children become more foolish day by day. It is lamentable.</p>
<p>Buying books is a good thing, but buying them without reading them, only to have them eaten by worms or left for future generations to auction off, such a bookworm has no meaning.</p>

<p>— Li Wanjü</p>
<p>The absurdity and outrageousness of Basic English, I think anyone who has read Mr. Lin Yutang's article "Take Away the Hair on My Face" (see the "Free Talk" section of the 10th of this month) will understand to some extent and will not be fooled again. Judging from the articles published in "Free Talk," Mr. Qian Gechuan, who desperately advocates Basic English as an international language, seems not even to have seen that strange book "Carl and Anna," written with 850 words, which is neither clear nor understandable, and makes people laugh until their stomachs hurt. Mr. Qian probably just happened to see some text introducing Basic English in some Japanese publication, and was amazed as if it were a groundbreaking idea, regarding it as a rare commodity. Without delving into it deeply, he hastily brought it to China to boast about it, fully expecting it to cause a sensation. Unexpectedly, it became material for Mr. Lin Yutang's humor, a case of trying to be clever but only making a fool of himself, truly regrettable!</p>
<p>The clumsiness and ridiculousness of Basic English go without saying; and Mr. Qian Gechuan’s act of bringing something he himself did not deeply understand to China to mislead young people, as if he knew what he was doing, is indeed astonishing in its audacity. If this were done by some ignorant monk, we might not bother to comment, but since it was done by someone who received higher education in Japan, it naturally deserves more severe criticism.</p>
<p>As for criticizing Mr. Qian Gechuan and the Basic English he advocates from a scholarly perspective, the authoritative English scholar Mr. Lin Yutang and many Esperanto speakers have already undertaken that task, so I don't want to say anything more. What I want to point out now are a few baseless lies in an article published by Mr. Qian in the "Free Talk" section on the 11th.</p>
<p>Because Mr. Qian wanted to prove that Basic English could be used as an international language, he stated: (Why can Basic English be used as an international language? Because in European and American countries, English is commonly spoken, even in Japan.) And again: (If it can be used in both the East and West, isn't that an international language?) Even if we disregard the fact that Basic English and ordinary English are two completely different things, someone who understands "kiss" might not necessarily understand "lips." Even if we concede that everyone who understands English is extremely clever, and hearing someone mention "the white root that makes your eyes water" they will know it is referring to "onion," is English actually commonly spoken in European and American countries? Can English really be used in both the East and West?</p>
<p>I have not been to America, so I don't know if English is as commonly spoken in the Latin American countries there as it is in the United States and Canada; I have not been to Japan, so I don't know if English is as commonly spoken in Japan as it is in the Shanghai concessions. But Europe, I have been to, and I spent nearly seven long years there. I have traveled to many famous cities and remote towns, and based on my own experience, I can say with certainty that, apart from the British Isles, English is not commonly spoken in other places. Although in touristy places like Switzerland, English is sometimes useful, it's not just English that is spoken there. If you know French and German, you can travel freely without any problems. In other places that attract a lot of tourists, such as the metropolis of Paris, English is not spoken at all. Unless you are a multi-millionaire and can afford to stay in those large hotels that cater exclusively to dignitaries, where there are staff who understand various languages to assist you, someone like Mr. Qian, a petit bourgeois, who goes to such a metropolis and only knows how to speak English without understanding the local language, and cannot find a Chinese student there to help him, will not only find it inconvenient to ask for directions or buy things, but will also have major problems finding accommodation. If Mr. Qian thinks that the ticket collectors, police, shop assistants, etc., on the trams in Berlin or Paris can all speak a few words of pidgin English like those in Shanghai, then he is completely mistaken. Moreover, Europeans highly respect their own national languages, especially those nations like France and Germany who are very proud of their own culture. Even if they understand English, they are unhappy when they see yellow-faced people in their countries speaking English instead of their language, and they will refuse to speak English to you. I think Mr. Qian never even dreamed of such a situation, right?</p>
<p>If Mr. Qian wants to prove that English "can be used in both the East and West," then he should first go to the West and see for himself before speaking. He hasn't even been to Europe, yet he sits at his desk in the editor's office and talks nonsense, using the situation in Eastern colonies and backward countries like Japan to extrapolate to many civilized ancient countries in Europe, thinking that the people of those countries are as proud of being able to speak English as the yellow race are. This is truly a grave mistake!</p>
<h3 id="e272">### New Autumn Miscellany <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— A Traveler</p>
<p>(Autumn is coming!)</p>
<p>Autumn has truly arrived. The sunny days are still fine, but at night, wearing a cotton shirt, you feel a chill. The newspapers are full of articles about "autumn," big and small: welcoming autumn, lamenting autumn, grieving autumn, blaming autumn... etc. To keep up with the trend, I also wanted to do a little of that, but I just couldn't. I think, even wanting to "grieve autumn" requires good fortune, which is truly enviable.</p>
<p>I remember when I was young, when my parents were taking care of me, the most interesting thing was a little ailment. I couldn't get seriously ill, as that would be painful and dangerous. When I had a minor illness, I would lie lazily in bed, feeling a little sad and a little spoiled, a small bitterness mixed with sweetness, truly like the poetic atmosphere of autumn. Alas, ever since I began wandering the world, my inspiration has fled, and I don't even get minor illnesses anymore. Occasionally, I read famous essays by literary figures, saying that autumn flowers change color sadly and the sea falls silent, but I only feel my own numbness more and more. I have never seen autumn flowers turn color sadly for me; as long as there is wind, the sea is always roaring, regardless of whether I want to be lively or quiet.</p>
<p>A certain lady told us: (Chen is studying science, but at this moment, he completely forgot his interests. All that existed in his mind was to enjoy the beauty of nature to the fullest...) This is also a kind of fortune. I studied science very superficially, having only read a biology textbook, but I can't completely forget those teachings, that flowers are the reproductive organs of plants, that the chirping of insects and the warbling of birds are for courtship, and so on. Last night, while idly in a deserted field, I heard crickets chirping under wild chrysanthemums, and I felt like it was a beautiful scene. Inspired by the poetic mood, I wrote two lines of new poetry:</p>
<p>Below the reproductive organs of the wild chrysanthemum,</p>
<p>The cricket is courting.</p>
<p>Looking at it after writing it, although it is a bit more elegant than the vulgar songs sung by the common people, it is still overshadowed by the poetry of the new poets that comes from "opium withdrawal purity". Writing too scientifically and too truthfully is not elegant. If it were rewritten as old poetry, perhaps it wouldn't be like this. The reproductive organs, using Mr. Yan Fu's translation method, can be called the "sexual organs"; as for "courting," I myself don't understand its etymology, but according to those who are familiar with Shanghai, it comes from Western men and women walking arm in arm, and is extended to mean seducing or pursuing the opposite sex. Courting means hanging, that is, holding each other. Then, my poem translates to:</p>
<p>Below the wild chrysanthemum's sexual organs,</p>
<p>The chirping cricket is hanging an elbow.</p>
<p>Although it is a bit difficult to understand, it seems much more elegant, which is to say, better. People don't understand it, so it's elegant, which is to say, so it's good. This is still a secret to becoming a literary giant. What do you think, Mr. Shao Xunmei and others of the new poet class?</p>

<p>He stopped speaking, listened quietly at the door for a while, then shook his head and continued.</p>
<p>(My brother wanted to shout and challenge them—just shout once—to let those people know that we are free-growing pirates, relying entirely on our weapons and the vast sea. But I begged him with our love not to shout. Wasn't I hearing her breath beside me? And I knew that even if he didn't shout, they would come after us soon. My brother truly loved me. He rowed without making a splash. He simply said, "Now you only have half a person left—the other half is with that woman. I can wait. When you become a whole person again, you will come back here with me to challenge them. We are sons of the same mother." I did not answer him. All my strength and all my spirit were in my hands holding the oars, because I was desperately hoping to escape with her to a safe place that men's anger and women's jealousy could not reach. My love was so fervent that I thought if I could escape from the wrath of Indji-Mitta and the sword of our leader, this love would lead me to a land unknown to death. We rowed urgently, panting between our teeth. The oars were deeply immersed in the smooth water. We rowed out of the river; we flew along the canals among the shallows. We rounded the dark coast; we rounded the sandy beach where the sea whispered to the land; the glittering white sand grazed my boat, flashing brilliantly, the boat was flying so fast. We did not speak. Only once did I say, "Sleep, Diamelen, for soon you will need to exert all your strength." I heard her sweet voice, but I never turned my head. The sun rose, and we were still moving forward. The water falling from my face was like rain falling from the clouds. We were flying between light and heat. I never looked back, but I knew that my brother's eyes, behind me, were staring ahead, because the boat flew straight like an arrow leaving the string. No one rowed better than my brother. Many times, together, in that little boat, we had won the race. But I had never used all my strength like this time, this time, it was our last time rowing together. In our homeland, no one was braver or stronger than my brother. I couldn't spare the strength to look back at him, but behind me, I constantly heard his breathing becoming louder. But he still did not speak. The sun hung high in the sky. The heat sticking to my back was like a ball of fire. My ribs were about to come loose. But I still couldn't get enough air into my chest. Then I felt that I had to use my last breath to shout, "Let's rest for a moment!" "Good!" he replied; his voice was firm. He was strong. He was brave. He knew neither terror nor fatigue... My brother!)</p>
<p>A kind of murmur, strong and gentle, faint and weak, like trembling leaves, like swaying branches, passed through the luxuriant depths of the forest, passed over the calm surface of the shallow lake, and the lake water between the pilings suddenly stirred up, striking the thin wood. A warm breeze brushed the faces of the two men, blowing past with a mournful sound, as if it were the short and resounding breath of an uneasy sigh from the land of dreams.</p>

<h3 id="e274">Each Week Worse Than the Last: The Second Anniversary! Public Servant <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>What day is tomorrow? If we are speaking in terms of the total population of China, then I dare to believe that not many people know or remember what is special about tomorrow's date. But we believe that most Japanese and many Chinese in the three northeastern provinces and Jehol have known it for a long time, because all kinds of ceremonies to celebrate the success of the "September 18th Incident" began to be planned a month ago in major cities in Japan and the three northeastern provinces. In the past week, they have even more loudly announced to the public to participate in the promotion: what reviews of the army, navy, and air force! The order of the "September 18th Incident" celebration! Reports on the achievements of the puppet state of Manchuria since its establishment! In addition, there are memorial services to arouse even greater patriotic emotions of hostility and hatred among the Japanese people to mourn the Japanese soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the conquest of China!</p>
<p>Looking back at our own situation, what is it like? To put it simply, everything shows the facts of: surrender, compromise, complacency, forgetfulness, and shamelessness! On the day of the first anniversary of the "September 18th Incident" last year, the government still occasionally expressed its determination to "resist for the long term," and society and individuals did their best to actively assist the Northeastern Volunteer Army and continue to boycott inferior goods. Although the enthusiasm was greatly reduced compared to before the "January 28th Incident" and the Shanghai truce agreement, the spirit of striving was still felt to be largely present. But by this second anniversary—since the North China truce agreement—the scene has changed greatly! The territory lost is even greater than on the first anniversary! The entire territory of Jehol and Duolun Yukai are under the sway of the Rising Sun flag, and the power and strength of the Japanese in North China is expanding day by day. In fact, the severity of the national crisis and the urgency of the environment are many times more serious than in the year of the "September 18th Incident" and the first anniversary, adding many more difficult facts. However, this more serious and difficult situation has instead made the attitude of our government and people leisurely. Everything that was loudly called for in the past—resistance, economic severance—seems to be gradually fading and vanishing. The salaries of government personnel have returned to the state before the "September 18th Incident," which can also be said to be a longer and more enduring expression of "long-term resistance" and "bearing humiliation and carrying heavy burdens"? As for our people, most of the anti-Japanese generals who led the Volunteer Army in the Northeast in the past have been forced to flee into the customs. The existing Volunteer Army also cannot carry out large-scale resistance due to the decreasing supply of relief. The only weapon held by the general public—boycotting inferior goods—cannot be insisted upon. Alas! Looking at the past and comparing it to the present, it truly makes people feel that this unprecedented "September 18th Incident" national disaster anniversary is truly getting worse every year!</p>
<p>Some people say: "Human nature is forgetful, and ignorant and inferior nations are even more forgetful." Although we Chinese are disappointing, if we do not admit that we are an "ignorant and inferior" nation, then how should we strive to awaken and break the silent status quo of whitewashing peace in the increasingly serious environment of national and international disasters in the future? We must deeply understand that the current silent status quo is also the status quo of national subjugation and racial extinction. If things continue like this, getting worse every year, the result will only be to become slaves to a conquered country, at the mercy of others!</p>
<p>Look! Our enemies, how are they building up their military and preparing for a second world war in a down-to-earth manner? If we have the ambition to save the country and the determination to kill the enemy, then in the future, whether it is the government or the people, we should show it to others through practical actions. This is our only hope for commemorating the second anniversary of the "September 18th Incident." Otherwise, if we only talk empty words of long-term resistance or play some half-hearted tricks of boycotting inferior goods, then, to put it bluntly, this is tantamount to "selling out the people" and "flattering the enemy"!</p>

<h3 id="e275">### Dock Coolie <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>Every day, when the morning light is faint, I spend twelve copper coins to buy two pairs of worker's (ingots candles) (two large pancakes sandwiched with two fried dough sticks), eat them, and then set off towards the Bailianjing XX dock. The ships, great and magnificent presidential ships loaded with foreign goods, are moored like mountains along the edge of the dock.</p>
<p>Six o'clock has already struck. After Song Xiaosanzi calls the roll like a platoon leader, the coolie (i.e., worker) life of (the devil is calling you poor! Endure it hard!) begins again. The "Wenzhi" (goods warehouse) winches one load after another from the ship's cargo hold to the dock, piles of goods: cotton, wheat flour, Oriental salted fish, cars, airplanes... all moved to the cement on the dock. Our fellow workers, some use trolleys, pushing them load after load into the cargo hold, some carry them on their shoulders one load at a time, some carry them together with two people, also on their shoulders, and some push and pull them together with four, six, or eight people, all going towards the warehouse. However, soon, their hands are scratched and bleeding, and their shoulders quickly become red, swollen, and painful. However, these are all minor matters. In the bottom of the ship's cargo hold, under the "Wenzhi," and when moving on the swaying gangplank, this is where there is the greatest danger to life, but who cares about it? Like the time the pre-water ship, the World Class XX Presidential Ship, arrived, our fellow worker, Xiao Fuzi, fell from the deck (carelessly) (?) into the cargo hold, and immediately suffered the misfortune of being crushed to pieces, alas! His death was truly tragic! But who cares about it? Ask the company for compensation? But they will answer you like this: (This has nothing to do with our company. His "carelessness" is not the responsibility of our company. But the company is very "sorry" for his misfortune...). The sun has reached the center, and the fierce light shines down like fire, baking our backs like Cantonese roasted pig skin. It's time for lunch, each person deducts four hundred cash, coarse No. 4 rice, winter melon and tofu soup, a dish of salted radish, alas! We (coolies), low-class people, are only worthy of eating such food.</p>
<p>One o'clock in the afternoon has arrived. The "Wenzhi" roars again, no matter how red and swollen your shoulders are, no matter how painful, you must never rest, otherwise the foreman's fist will immediately be sent to your chest, and even your day's wages will be confiscated (actually, it goes into the foreman's own pocket). Like this, until the sun sets in the west, at six o'clock, by which time the cargo hold is piled high with goods like a small mountain, our work is considered to be one day's work. Then our "old friend" Xiao Sanzi issues us a bamboo slip like the gentlemen in the refugee camp, and in addition to deducting four hundred cash for lunch, you can also get one thousand two hundred cash from the old man's house.</p>
<p>(Isn't it one dollar and forty-five cents a day?) After receiving my wages with the bamboo slip, I asked one of our fellow workers. He looked around and then replied to me: (Where is there such a good world? Alas! Old brother—in the past, the company issued one dollar and eighty-five cents a day, but now it has been reduced by forty cents, and it is all judged by the contractor, and after one judgment, two judgments, three judgments... Old brother, that's right—one dollar and forty-five cents a day, the first judgment takes away forty cents, the second judgment takes away twenty cents, and the third judgment also takes away twenty cents. After the stripping and drawing, isn't there only one string and six hundred cash left?) After hearing these words, I suddenly felt enlightened. I stroked my red and swollen shoulders, but could only swallow a sigh that I dared not utter. Then I thought again: we will only have work to do when the ship arrives next Monday, but what about life?</p>

<p>, the second judgment took away two corners, and the third judgment also took away two corners, after stripping and drawing, wouldn't it be only left with a sling of six hundred copper coins?)

So I thought again: we will only have work when the ship arrives next Monday, but what about life?</p>
