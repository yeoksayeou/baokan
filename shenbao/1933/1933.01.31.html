<p>㈠國聯之新形勢</p>
<p>國聯對中日爭端之調解。事實上自日本强行佔據東北僞造「滿洲國」以來。即已宣告失敗。矧再加以山海關失陷。凌源開魯。屢被轟炸。據此事實作證。中日問題。已非折衝樽爼之間。空言維持和平所能了結。不過國聯尙欲憑藉歷史的虚名支持其暫時塲面。而徒空言和平。高倡調解其所注意者又僅爲日本一方面所謂之事實。此種事實。完全爲軍事力量所造成。距離和平前途固甚遥遠。即於英法各國所理想之均勢亦恰背道而馳。一年半以來。我國對國聯未嘗稍加蔑視。而主持國聯之英法兩大國。其對華好意何在。吾人迄今。仍未能理解。雖細密思量。除就均分利得欲打破日本在東亞獨占之局以外。吾人殊難承認其有所謂公道正義之存在。且日本軍國主義者肆其鐵腕。撕碎華盛頓九國公約。非戰公約等國際條約。不顧國際信義。藐視人類公理。惟有依恃武力以遂行其所謂「東亞門羅主義。」換言之即實行「大陸政策」是也。我國未能積極從事於鐵血戰爭。固處於失敗地位。而國際聯盟一再遷不日本所謂之事實。以爲有謂解希望以情實而論。國聯亦不免屈服於日本軍國主義鐵蹄之下苟且求全。</p>
<p>蓋前年十月二十四日國聯理事會。尙能决議勸告日本撤退擾亂東北之日本軍隊。雖無力執行。但尙敢於正視東北事變之正體。今則惟有遇事敷衍并華盛頓九國公約而抺殺之以爲回復東三省之原狀爲不可能。英國代表且以爲「宣布調解失敗爲極不合宜之舉。」是故九國分科起草委員會。并開會精神亦甚散漫。遑論裁制日本暴力侵略行動耶。總而言之。欲以「和平勸告」說服瘋狂達於極點之日本軍閥。實等於「對牛彈琴。」絶無是處。</p>
<p>所不幸者厥爲左右國聯行動之大國。如英國者縱未必如報紙所傳與日本訂有秘密協定。然至少於日本之罰情多。於我國之善意少也。此種情勢。就目前而論。或爲一時苟安之想。冀以敷衍暫時之和平。然而日本旣獨占東北。則各國在遠東勢力均衡。已經打破戰爭之突發。乃愈不可避免矣。列國所得者幾何哉。</p>
<p>㈡日軍侵略乃愈急劇</p>
<p>國聯態度愈遷就。我國愈温和。則日本軍國主義施行其「大陸政策。」對華侵略。且意猛烈。丙田廉哉外相　　貴族院演說。竟公言𤍠邊爲「滿洲僞國」之領土。日本將根據「日滿議定書。」實行對華用兵。於國聯盟約十五條第四項之適用與否。日本陸軍當局。竟發出如下談話。</p>
<p>「國聯輕視自己本來任務。而週旋於與遠東問題無甚大關係之小國不承認（側重其理論）此風如長。則日華紛爭將益見擴大。益加惡化。至如至於是惡劣情勢時。雖退出國聯。亦毫不足懼且亦無躊躇之必要。然吾人仍當繼續努力····啓發國聯。并糾正其謬見····」</p>
<p>日本用武之態度。已至明顯。且在國聯委任統治之馬利亞納及步琉二島建築海軍要塞。近又放出「縱退出國聯而代管之太平洋羣島可不交還」之空氣。其意何居。亦不用吾人之解剖。其侵略之步驟。在目前固集中全力於東北。將來恐將次第及於南洋。印度澳洲。未必不演成現時東北同樣之事實也。遼遠之將來。姑勿置論。今日之急。則不容不問。吾人已大禍臨頭。生死决於俄傾。安危定於轉瞬之際必須審度當前局勢。日本軍隊已强占山海關九門口。進而迫脅凌源開魯矣。𤍠河幅員六十萬方里。如我仍不起而作必死之鬭爭。恐將不免爲達吉黑第二。設再不幸而𤍠河失守。則華北門户全被拆毀。敵方任何時期。均可長驅直入矣。今後匪特收復東北北。渺不可期。而黃河流域。且將陷於不可收拾之境矣。</p>
<p>時至今日。我國於一切和平方法。均不適用。呼求他人之帮助。亦敢决其毫不濟事惟一途徑。即時奮起以自己之血與鐵聲破敵人輕蔑横暴之心理。喚起友邦之同情。振作自身之頽廢。</p>

<p>第一日本政治非但未復「常態」、且其非常之現象、愈加緊急、在國内在左傾的潛行運動、特别盛旺、革命的理論、已深入一般工農羣衆、且浸入各師團體中、右傾各團體中、到處皆有赤化之痕跡、例如赤色秘密組織所用之槍械、多來自右傾團體、如何上肇博士大塜金之助博士、皆係學術界一時之選、現皆牽入赤色雰圍中、神聖之司法界、近亦發生赤化案件、東京地方裁判所判事尾崎正道、坂本忠之助均已赤化、此事震動日本全國、使日本現政治發生根本動摇、</p>
<p>第二軍人專政愈見露骨、去年度預算又復增加三千五百餘萬元日金、今年度除八億二千萬元預算案之外、新近六師團調動又增加二千萬元、此種龐大軍事費之支出、即表現日本侵略之積極、亦即加緊其所謂非常時之一端、</p>
<p>第三農村經濟恐慌益加深刻、一般物價、雖因通貨澎漲政策而提高、然工資所得及農産收入相對比較、反現低落、所謂時局匡救、純爲對資産家之救濟、於平民毫不相干、</p>
<p>第四對華北用兵、已開端緒、設使中國萬一抵抗、如戰爭相持至一兩年之久、則日本將因不堪負担軍費而至於發生變動、即任日軍佔領熱河灤東、勢必再行增加陸軍兩師團以至五師團、方足防守、軍費担負、必較現時增加一倍、日本軍人一時的興奮作用、更延長其所謂之非常時期、有此四者、則齋藤非常時内閣、遂略帶自己滿足之氣味、現議會且不能不自重重矣、蓋「預算案」爲齋藤内閣最大之難關、儘多可以批評指摘之點、足供議塲之論戰、例如時局匡救費大而無當、軍事費徒苦人民、買得國際間之非難、然而時局匡救費如經削减、則政友會一部份社會基礎｜地主及高利貸者、將羣起反對、致政友會根本地盤發生意外、故對時局匡救費、决不敢有異詞、軍事費則較時局匡救費更加有力、掛保護日本帝國招牌之軍備、誰敢出而招致軍部帶有槍劍氣之憤怒、</p>
<p>此外則决無「有價值之問題」、足以難到政府、足以取得日本人民之信賴、故政友會縱欲積極取得政權、捨棄其自重主義、然迫於環境、除自重之外、决無更有效之辦法、</p>
<p>六十四蒞會中、政友會如亟起打倒齋藤内閣、雖非不可能、但齋藤内閣倒後、如政權可以歸諸政友會之手、則政友會無論如何、亦必拚命一擊、取齋藤而代之、但依目前日本政治之情勢、一切皆須由軍部支配、政友會組閣之希望、極其微小、恐齋藤倒後、繼任者將較現時之齋藤更爲專横、政治情况、將此現狀更壞、或由大部分受軍部支配、而至於全部受軍部支配、甚至純爲軍人内閣、亦未可知、故政友會民政黨爲保存憲政之一綫希望起見、乃不得不遇事愼重、以高橋是溝之年高德重、猶須仰承軍部鼻息、其他更無論矣、如政友會興民政黨肯聯合一致、共同組閣、或尙可能、然政民兩黨皆受命於財閥、極爲多數青年軍官所不滿、而議會政治之衰頽、又爲當世必然之趨勢、加以日本政黨、信用掃地、即使組閣、亦不過軍部之爪牙而已、况政友會擁有絶大多數議席、兩黨合作、殊難有繼續之可能、是故齋藤内閣、雖不能克服非常時期、不能符合資本主義者之希望、現時仍有渡過六十四議會之可能、日本政局將不免長此在動摇中、由軍部支配、以敷衍其國政也、至於對外則依然繼續　預、肆行侵略而已（一月二十七日寄自東京）</p>

<p>復興計劃鐵部正在縝密研究</p>
<p>鐵道部長顧孟餘氏、因洽商復興兩路等要務、業於前昨由京抵滬、昨日即分赴各處商洽、並定二三日内即返京、中央社記者、昨晨驅車往訪顧氏於其寓所、詢以復興兩路計劃等、據談如次、</p>

<p>兩路因年來經營不善、致虧空甚鉅、去年兼受滬戰影響、損失更鉅、若不立加整頓、勢將不堪收拾、復興兩路計畫、鐵部正在縝密研究中、目下最要急務、厥惟鞏固兩路經濟、其方法開源與節流並行、俾收入增而開支減、經濟得以鞏固、然後計議復興路政、例如㈠兩路機頭車輛、盡係三十年舊物、須立即添購、㈡兩路鐵軌枕木等、亦均已破舊、須即調換、㈢兩路來往客商、以三四等乘客爲多、但對三四等車輛内一切設備、均未注意、茲將立即改革、以重衛生而安行旅、至要求減低三四等票價、因關國庫收入、未能實行、㈣京滬路來往乘客擁擠、鐵部决將該路添築雙軌、俾增開班次、以免擁擠、並先將上海至蘇州一段先行鋪設、因該段已有添築雙軌路基、俟鐵軌枕木等購就後、年内即可動工、其餘各段雙軌、因路基關係、當展緩添築、至兩路各項欠欵、現正設法歸償、</p>

<p>歷述不服者四項</p>
<p>蘇州通訊、前招商局總經理李國杰、因於去年九月間、將上海招商局所有之房地碼頭、簽訂合同、分别典押於美商中國營業公司　以周息九厘、訂借上海規銀二千萬兩、並交付前招商局監督陳孚木墊欵銀七十萬兩一案、經上海地方法院以背信凟職等罪判處有期徒刑七年後、李奉判不服、仍延張一鵬·沙訓義·江一平·三律師撰狀、來蘇上訴高院、茲悉已定二月十五日開庭審理、茲探錄其上訴書全文如左、</p>
<p>刑事上訴狀上訴人李國杰、辯護人張一鵬律師·沙訓義律師·江一平律師·爲不服上海地院判處罪刑提具</p>
<p>上訴理由　事、竊上訴人因招商局事檢察官起訴、經上海地院地字八七二號刑事判决主文内開、李國杰共同違背任務意圖加不法損害於招商局一罪、處有期徒刑二年、褫奪公權四年、又對於公務員違背職權、交付賄賂一罪、處有期徒刑二年、褫奪公權三年、定執行有期徒刑三年、褫奪公權四年、裁判確定前覊押日數、以二日抵有期徒刑一日、陳孚不停止審判、賄賂規銀七十萬兩没收、如已消失、應追徵之等因、上訴人對於全部判决、均有不服、業於不變期内、提起上訴、茲特詳陳不服理由於下、</p>
<p>責任問題　爲季罪要素之一　上訴人爲招商局總經理、驟觀此項名義、似有行政全權、然總經理之上有監督、監督之上有交通部、總經理受監督處之指揮、無直接交通部之權、簡言之、卽監督對於交通部負責、總經理對於監督負責　此皆見於監督處章程及總經理組織大綱之規定、職務權限、統係分明、原判以上訴人奉命簽訂各合同及交付墊欵七十萬兩、爲上訴人背信凟職之罪案、無論合同並不違法、交欵亦非行賄、（詳情下節說明）縱加原判之曲解認爲實係背信凟職、然亦僅得加諸監督、而與上訴人無干、何則　借欵合同及租約備忘錄之簽訂、無一不奉有監督命令、在第一審早經抄呈法院、倘不見信、儘可以職權調查、（原本交美商存查曾於庭訊中供明、）墊欵七十萬兩、亦屬奉監督面諭交辦、雖未有正式令文、然報載陳孚不通電已有保管七十萬兩之承認、並由檢察處查明、均爲陳孚不收取該欵後、化名指存各銀行、卽原審亦認確當、苟非監督交辦、何以全數在其手中、此種特定事項、已臻明瞭、自無另行舉證之必要、（見刑訴法二九五條）夫奉行長官命令及下級官吏之義務以履行義務之忠實、而判爲共犯、則行政威信何以維持、刑法第三十四三十五條等於虚設、上訴人於原審黏呈各項證據、又經　護律師當庭反覆陳述、乃判决理由全不予以採取、且其不予採取或另有反證之理由、始終無一字之釋明、此其不服者一也、其次</p>
<p>借欵成立　經過、在上訴人幾經研究、幾經磋商、經歷萬難、排除隐禍、就主觀立塲、固認爲對於招商局本身、實已有利無害、今更離去主觀、以客觀意旨觀察之、夫使招商局業務恢宏、資本優裕、無債權之逼勒、無破産之危險、而竟無故借此巨欵受種種條件之束縛、是則苟非大愚卽爲狂妄、此時之招商局何如破船二十餘艘、客貨視爲異途、急債千七百萬、周轉久經絶望、求助於股東、股東則相咨嗟、呼籲於政府、政府則空言整理、上訴人一方爲股東代表、一方爲政府命官、重任集於一肩、安忍聽其没落、所幸交通部總次長允許於前、陳孚不以次長兼監督又批准於後、美商中國營業公司素有情感竭意交儀、且書面商榷十餘次、口頭交涉若干時、僅乃定局、原判輕輕以擅借外債四字罪之、試問招商局處此環境、能不借債而維持吾國僅有航業耶、國内行莊、久無往來、則不得不借外債、監督批准、方始執行、又何得謂爲擅借、此其不服者二也、又其次</p>
<p>各項合同　之内容、（第一）利息及折扣問題、原判引據起訴書所稱二千萬兩借欵、實收之數、减少三百五十萬之多、因斷定加害出於意圖、不知折扣與利息、有想互輕重之作用、今定利息爲九釐、故折扣爲八五、假令利息爲九釐八毫四忽、則折扣可删、故當局者認八五實收爲不合算、則改增不及一曁之息息、卽可十足收欵、（計算式已於原審列入證據）况世界金融互有關係、上海市政府復興公債照票面八折收欵、以彼例此、伺爲功罪相反耶、灍自改歸國營以來、零星借欵、期短客多、東縛重重、近且水盡山窮、舍利用外資、别無生路可尋、試閱美商初次來函、（該函譯文、已於原審列入證據、）其要求之利息折扣、較合同所定、固已核减甚多、倘加害出於意圖、何必費許多筆墨爲哉、（第二）收買及變賣之優先權問題、此項規定、不論中外借欵、已爲普通一律之條件、自非上訴人所獨創、至其利害、全屬事實問題、茲就合同全文言之、一千萬兩之建築合同、及同額之盋頭合同、其本利償還方法、均經詳載無遺、所有新建房屋及出租碼頭之租金、又碼頭公司半數股本之收益、無一不收入招商局存賬、以備償付本息之用、綜計二十年中有盈無絀、則出售該産之全部或一部以及到期不能履行之各種附屬條件、永無實現之可能、卽優先權亦永無執行之後患、原判以條件附契約視爲單純契約、抑亦不思之甚矣、（第三）法律適用及掛號旗註册問題、同國人間之任何契約、雖無法律適用問題、然尙有所在地法契約地法種種選擇自由、况一方爲華人、一方爲美商、自不能不預行約定、故用中國法與用美國法並無高下優劣之分、若謂中國招商局不應舍本國法而不用、試查國際私法所規定適用本國法者不一而足、皆外國法也、其又何以自解、至註美國册掛美國旗、此皆在貸欵未清以前、所有權未經移轉之結果、一經付清、自然消滅、事例</p>

<p>｜社會局定下星期公佈｜</p>
<p>華東社云、滬戰之後、所有戰區民營工廠完全毀損無遺　實業部前爲謀統計起見、行令本市國際貿易局會同市社會局·及會計師公會·共同調查、所有民營工廠損失情形、經數月之工作、業已全部工竣、刻方從事方區分業統計中、昨據社會局工廠調查股主任田和卿君、譚調查經過及目下結束情形頗詳、茲錄如下、</p>
<p>調查完竣　據田氏談、在去歲一二八戰事結束後、本局即從事調查各民營工廠、於戰事中損失情形、其調查手續、則分爲三種㈠直接損失、㈡間接損失、㈢人事損失、惟以事先各該廠或因經理尙未明瞭調查意義、或因無負責人答復、致辦理上殊多棘手、嗣經數度解釋與探查、目下業已全部結束、</p>
<p>定期公佈　此次調查雖已竣事、惟本局爲求詳細報告起見、故目下尙須將各項表格、予以分區分業分類、此項工作、雖于短時期内即可完畢、但本局日常工作、重要者正多、致不克耑一從事於此、故須俟至下星期内、始可全部竣事公佈</p>
<p>損失略數　至此次災區中、究竟損失幾何、以前報載、實屬不確、據本局之調查結果、總計約四百餘家以上、内中以商務印書館一家損失爲最鉅、約一千萬元以上、次爲閘北水電公司、連同其餘織布廠紗廠等、共約四千萬元弱、按此次調查範圍、係屬包圍上海市、其寳山·嘉定·各縣、不在其内、倘連同各縣統計、或可在一萬萬元以上也、</p>
<p>昭然毋庸多贅、其急應說明者、卽以上各條件是否損失局産妨害航政是也、查去年郭專員外峰經手購置腦威輪船兩隻、命名海祥海瑞、價欵未清以前、仍掛腦威國旗、條件載在合同、此固世界買賣船隻之通例、亦非上訴人所獨創、招商局歷年營業失敗、原因固我、而迭次内戰、疲於徵調、亦未始非致病之一、萬一不幸再以未經付價之船、重遭挫折、其何以堪、旗册之識别、旣得以原有之船、儘量供政府之用、又得以新船所入、接濟局用開支、對於招商局固維持於不敵、卽對於政府亦益盡其輸將、設遇對外戰爭、且足爲國航之屏障、固不獨債權者得以維護其權利、上訴人所謂有利無害者此也、原判不諒苦心、務盡其吹毛求疪之能事、此其不服者三也、</p>
<p>其次墊欵　七十萬兩之交付、上訴人當庭明係營業公司表示其信用、該欵卽由陳孚木保管、此皆眞實之供述、而原判乃武斷爲均屬飾詞、但按照借欵合同、公司付欵、在債劵發行之後、苟非表示其信用、公司何爲而預墊、又此七十萬兩確由陳孚木分存銀行、苟非陳孚木自任保管、何以該欵均由伊一人支配、憑此事實之證明、斷無否認之餘地、謂爲飾詞、果何所據、原判謂上訴人交付純係賄賂性質、查賄賂者於正項之外、秘密要素、結果必化爲烏有、今公司以墊欵名義繳納、上訴人亦以墊欵名義收受、（有收據爲憑已列入證據呈案、）且時間爲下午三時、地點爲辦公廳、公開授受、名正言順、此而視爲賄賂、誠古今中外所罕聞、若以陳孚木接受此欵、是否妥爲保管、抑有侵佔行爲、是則别一問題、烏可倒果爲因、至在偵查庭所供、不惜小費等語、此皆上訴人事後揣測陳孚木之心理、筆錄簡略、詞與意違、且依上述說明、賄峈之說不雖成立、按諸刑訴法二百八十條之規定、仍以事實爲前提、斷不能以含糊之筆錄爲金科玉律也、原判明知其非賄賂、而以性質强爲附會、此其不服者四也、</p>
<p>又查刑法第三百六十六條之背信罪、以不法爲要件、上訴人簽訂各合同、旣遵依政府頒布之法令縱令實有損害、根本上已與條文不合、若因招商局爲股分有限公司、應得股東會之同意、則招商局股東之權利久已名存實亡、公司法已失其効、爲經理者舍服從行政長官之法令外無他途也、準此以淪、原審引用背信罪旣有未當、而引用凟職罪尤絶對出於周内、上訴人亦知政府威權實足影響一般之心理、第念司法獨立、方在萌芽、必有公理重伸之一日、迫請鈞院撤銷原判、宣告無罪、實爲德便、謹狀江蘇高等法院公鑒、</p>

<p>東流江擱淺　三北公司之長江船鳳浦輪、上次在滬赴漢、由南京帶載伏龍輪卸起之貨物旅客上水、至本月二十二日開回滬上、乘客希望到上海度廢歲、詎二十三日行到九江附近地名東流、因江水銳退而遭擱淺、當由漢口分局派拖駁多艘、駛往失事地駁去貨物、經過三天之久、方得將船身曳出、</p>
<p>太子磯遇險　該輪由東流救出、已經誤期多日、船主即行開駛下水、詎料在二十九日夜中九時、鳳浦行到安慶附近之太子磯江面、又遇淺水難航、時當深夜、該輪復又擱入太子磯之淺灘上、第二度失事、鳳浦船身深陷沙泥之中、自身又不能移動、船主用再度求救、</p>
<p>青浦往救護　鳳浦二次發出求救電告後、爲停泊南京之該局青浦輪得悉、立即駛往助救、船到時已經夜中十一時黑暗難辨、無法拖曳、青島乃發電至滬報告、擬俟昨日漲潮時往救、大致可望曳出、唯鳳浦兩度遭擱、輪底恐有損傷、現擬返滬後勘騐修理、但班期已經躭誤至六天矣、</p>

<p>引擎爆出火星燃燒棉花</p>
<p>天寒水管冰凍無從撲救</p>
<p>損失約十餘萬元</p>
<p>昨晨七時三十分、新閘路北成都路新閘橋南堍顧天盛棉花廠、因棉花着火、突肇焚如、經中央新閘及閘北各段救火會極力灌救、始於傍午救熄、損失不貲、茲將詳情紀後、</p>

<p>顧天盛棉花廠、係專營絲尾棉頭、經機製後、再行發售、爲本地人顧天盛新開設、廠址在新閘橋南堍北成都路一零八六弄四十號内、係自建三層水泥屋、内有男女工人一百七十餘人、經理名陳泰生、該廠曾於廢歷十二月二十三日停工、至昨日方始開工、故各工人於七時左右、均陸續進廠、内中專管機器及漂洗工人、即動手試車、詎轉未數匝、引擎内突有火星爆出、落於已經漂洗之棉花上、頓時着火延燒、</p>

<p>據該廠工人云、平日彼等將已經漂洗之棉花上機時、該引敬内每月火星爆出、着棉即燒、以漂洗須用硫磺、而硫磺又易引火之故、曾由該廠在每車之旁裝有水管、遇有火警、灌救即滅、當昨日起火時、機器工人等急爲平、水管内部已成冰凍、滴水不下、因此未及數分鐘、火勢竟被蔓及機間全部、時各工人齊集屋内、一見火勢掑大、無可收拾、乃均紛上屋頂、高聲呼援、同時由鄰近廠家電告各段救火會告警、</p>

<p>閘北各段救火會首先趕到、見勢成燎原、而各工人尙踞屋頂、勢及危殆、乃亟用雲梯先將各工人救下、同時公共租界方面中央及新閘救火會亦聞訊驅車趕到、乃帮同灌救、總計約有四十餘水管齊向該廠灌射、但因天寒自來水來源稀少、幾乎供不應求、同時該廠牆壁高聳、施救爲難、各救火員乃在水管旁燃燒木料、俾水管結冰鎔化、一面升架雲梯、登高灌射、未幾水巡捕房救火輪亦趕到、乃即在蘇州河内開機抽水供給、各救火車水勢轉盛、火乃稍殺、直灌至傍午十一時許、始完全撲滅、該廠全部被毀、</p>

<p>｜汪礎厚君來信</p>
<p>我在高小讀了三年書，對於科學，素肯細心研究。有位女同學，和我情同意合，兩人訂了婚約，我滿擬畢業後，就往中學讀書，以期完成我的事業後，再與她正式結婚。不料去歲畢業後，父親便呌我出外做學徒了。我在没有進店的時候，自己總想在做事時，也能求點學問，然而進店後第二天，老板竟就發佈我的奴僕工作了！一直到現在，還是忙於奴僕的工作。對於學問，不消說是一天一天的退步啊！至於婚姻，實係終身幸福所關，但是做父母的，祇要爲子女完成婚娶，就盡了父母的責任，所以我父親也爲我配定了一個鄕村的女子，她呢，一字不識，天天祇曉得做那煮飯洗衣的工作！現在我是毫無人生樂趣，請問如何解决？</p>
<p>答··來書誦悉。你的問題没有什麽大不了。你旣然與一位女同學情投意合，訂了婚約，那你就守之勿渝，至於父母代你配的一個鄕村女子，你就寫封信給他們說明婚姻須由自主的道理，堅决地拒絶他們的「越俎代謀」好了。這是一。不過有一層，在你，以爲你那位女同學自然要比「一個鄕村的女子，一字不識，天天祇曉得做那煮飯洗衣的工作」要好得多，其實這也要看你是怎樣的看法。以我們的經騐，都市中的所謂女學生固然識得字，甚至還寫得信，說得幾句「平等」「自由」等等好聽的名詞。然而他們除了這些本領以外，祇餘下終日跑着摩登女郎的「摩登」裝束走，打扮得雖然花枝招展，飄飄欲仙，縱或不然，今天要到這裏看次電影，明天要到那裏看一次跳舞；今天看人家的大衣好，要敎你買，明天又看見人家的皮包好要請你辦，那你將應接不暇，疲於奔命。你若不應的話，那她便把愛情漸漸降低了，再有比你有錢的能應她的需要，那她便會「琵琶别抱，」顧而之他。結果，你或許只落一塲空，還不如「那煮飯洗衣」的鄕下女子好。我們不過是就一般的經騐說說，聊供足下的參考，自然足下的女成不是這樣一種女子，未可一槪而論也。這是二。你對於科學旣然肯細心研究，總要忙裏偷閒去讀書，只要你天天不放過，時時不放過，總有機會給你讀書，雖然是極短的時間，譬如一點鐘便好，再不然三二分鐘也是好的，天天早上起床後十分鐘，天天晚上就寢前二十分鐘，同事的大家夥兒聯起名來要求老閭，給這少少時間，做爲你們讀書報的時間，我想一定是可以辦得到的。這是三。</p>

<h3 id="c227">除夜 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 董筱枚</p>
<p>「一番心上温韾過，覓我意心廿六六年！」</p>
<p>我集了龔　人的這兩句詩，寫在昨天剛從照相館拿來的一幀相片上面，因爲今晚是舊曆的除夕，過了這一個晚上，我便是二十七歲的人了！</p>
<p>固然，過去的確獲得了心上的温　，現在呢，只有在回憶中遺留些冷香罷了！回憶也許是多情的，牠時刻在誘惑着我，有時候我總這樣想。</p>
<p>童心最最容易消失去的東西、兒時的歡樂也一樣。五六歲時是快樂的，然而現在就儘在追憶着也没有用，因爲太糢糊了。人一至九歲，本是最快樂的時期，并且自己也知道一些，可是愛我的父親偏於那年逝世了！在年少時便失去了樂園的鎖錀的我，還有什麽可說呢！</p>
<p>自己認爲曾得到一些兒快樂的，當然是年將弱冠的那幾年，現在回憶起來，却只足以使自己惋惜，因爲那樣的歡娛，在現在恐怕不會再有了！近來我總是這樣惆悵着！</p>
<p>昨天立民用韋浣花的「騎馬倚斜橋，滿樓紅袖招」詞意爲我繪了一幅畫，我細細地把玩，不禁起了一種黯然的情緒，便在上面繫上一闋踏莎行詞；</p>
<p>「紅袖招人，翠　解語，爲伊喚得青騐住；廻畔　　，斜橋倚　銷魂苦！春色依然，心期却誤，　春怕到　　路；樓的𨔠柳自　　，樓頭無復人延　　」</p>
<p>寫好了這闋詞，眞只有惘然之感！過去的一切，到現在完全是夢一樣的虚幻。易寒看見了立民的畫及我的詞，知道我又因此有所感觸，他一時興來，也就跟着塡一闋珍珠簾詞，爲我題在畫端，他的詞是這樣的··</p>
<p>「江南三月斜陽暮，騁　鞍，踏遍章台歸路；風疾馬蹄輕，掣繡窮朱户，猛一抬頭紅袖舉，又按　欲行還住，且住，聽　　簾前，爲伊傳语。　莫道舊日清遊，曾三生誓約，幾番雲雨。裘馬敝春風，甚飄零如許！公子歸來芳意歇，更白了髪絲千縷，千縷，對摇落垂楊，頻添凄楚！」</p>
<p>我讀了他的詞，越發想起了當年的歡娛和而今的零落，感傷的情緒不住地湧上心頭來了！我也不管給友人們看見會駡我又帶着「遺少」的神氣，或給我以别的更不好聽的詬言，就把這一幅畫粘在壁上。</p>
<p>明朝將是二十七歲的人，所謂華年歡樂，心上温馨，除了在壁上的畫圖中，深夜的夢寐間，糢糊的記憶裏可找到一些兒陰影之外，什麽都不會有了。</p>
<h3 id="c228">觀闘 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>我們中國人總喜歡說愛和平，但其實，是愛闘爭的，愛看别的東西闘爭，也愛看自己闘爭。</p>
<p>最普通的是闘鷄，闘蟋蟀，南方有闘黃頭，闘畫眉鳥，北方有闘鵪鶉，一羣閒人們圍着呆看，還因此賭輸贏。古時候有闘魚，現在變把戲的會使跳蚤打架。看今年的「申報月刋」，才知道金華又有闘牛，不過和西班牙是兩樣的，西班牙是人和牛闘，我們是牛和牛闘。</p>
<p>任他們闘爭着，自己不與聞，只是看。</p>
<p>然而軍閥們也不是自己親身在闘爭，是使兵士們在闘爭，所以頻年惡戰，而頭兒個個終於是好好的，忽而誤會消釋了，忽而杯酒言歡了，忽而共同禦侮了，忽而立誓報國了，忽而······。不消說，忽而當然不免又打起來了。</p>
<p>但我們的闘士，只有對於外敵却是兩樣的。近的，是「不抵抗」，遠的，是『負弩前驅』。</p>
<p>『不抵抗』在字面上已經說得明明白白。『負弩前驅』呢，弩機的製造法久已失傳了，必須待考古學家研究出來，製造起來，然後能夠負，然後能夠前驅。</p>
<p>還是留着國産的兵士和現買的軍火，自己闘爭下去罷。要這樣，自然，有時就一定非「愛和平」不可。</p>
<h3 id="c229">戰線（二） <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 朱雯</p>
<p>這夜裏他們三個就被派做哨兵，周三保是班長，他自家兒做了代班的。哨兵兩個人一班，第一班就是阿根和大發。風刮得那麽大，呼呼的帶着嘯子發響，碰在身上還有點兒麻竦竦的刺痛，裹在身上的大　也抵不了這種寒氣。不過寒冷也並不能威脅他們，兩個人都在心裏想着一些事，這種戰綫上的樣兒，使他們想到若果能夠把帝國主義在世界上毀滅。像大砲和炸彈把附近許多屋子毀壞了的一樣，他們更覺得興奮了。</p>
<p>「喂，你平時不是專講打倒帝國主義跟許多壓迫人家的人嗎，阿根？」</p>
<p>大發這個話，把想得正有勁兒的阿根倒嚇了一跳。</p>
<p>「是啦，這種東西是不能不打倒的！」</p>
<p>「我總說打仗這事情總不是好事，這一回打倒帝國主義，自然是兩樣的，不過日本當兵的，難道也是帝國主義的嗎？我想想就好像是說不大明白的。」</p>
<p>「帝國主義壓迫了他們，利用了他們，那末，我們爲要打倒帝國主義，也不能再顧到這些事。不是聽說過日本兵看見這兒衝過去，十次有九次向後逃走嗎？」</p>
<p>「咚···拍達，拍達，···痴···」，在遠遠的機關槍聲中間，一個大砲忽地響了起來，黑夜裏就是隔得遠也仍然那麽清楚，把阿根溜在嘴邊的話打住了。</p>
<p>隔三四分鐘又照樣的來了一個，機關槍仍舊不斷的響着。</p>
<p>「噍！那一邊燒得多厲害！」</p>
<p>大發跟着阿根在糢糊中指着的手看去，黑暗的空中在一角亮着一大塊一大塊的紅光。大發就呆呆的看了好一會，這是日本兵放火燒着老百姓的房子，已經燒過幾天了，消防隊也不會趕去撲滅的。</p>
<p>風一陣陣更緊啦，聽着遠遠的槍聲，兩個人也不再說話。到了换班的時候，他們就把三得跟周三保呌醒了，三得揉了揉眼睛，把棉大𣰉王</p>
<p>裹緊，很小心着踏痛伙伴們的頭脚，就往放哨的地方走去了。</p>
<p>許多雜亂的聲音把他們睡着的全鬧醒了，睜眼一看就明白是什麽會事；耳朶邊只聽得比昨夜更多的砲聲和槍聲，伙伴們都從氈子裏跳起來，忙着把東西收拾了。連長和連附都忽忽忙包圍的。</p>
<p>敵人的機關槍彈像雨點那樣飛過來，大砲也「痴···痴···」的在他們頭上飛過。但是這兒的機關槍自動步槍也一點兒不放鬆地送去，他們背後的砲隊，也發着小鋼砲。耳朶裏就一刻不停的鬧成了一片，兩手也是一刻没停的把子彈上膛，忙着撥動槍扭。</p>
<p>一個大砲開花彈剛巧落在陣地左邊的屋子上，那磚頭和瓦片像粉末一樣從四面飛志，地面好像給摇着的震動起來。</p>
<p>就在這時候，他們要在雙方的砲火底下銜上前去，因爲砲火是過分猛烈的，連長命令着各人俯倒了身子在地上爬，爬得又像跑那樣的快。到接近最前線的時候，大家又抬高一點身子，把步槍和輕機關槍都洒水一樣的噴出去，正好右邊的聯隊也到了相當的地點，便順利地衝向前去。對面的大砲接連着飛過他們的頭頂，敵人也擺着散兵線陣向前衝着。一見到這兒的隊伍可就有點兒驚惶，也不再前進了，把他們的自動步槍撥足了機扭掃射。這兒的隊伍並不給那些子彈阻擋着，却把刺刀挿上了步槍，衝到他瘊跟前去了。</p>
<p>這樣兒，開槍也是没用的，敵人的刺刀也上了。</p>
<p>「殺吧！殺···殺盡日本人！」</p>
<p>「打倒帝國主義！」</p>
<p>这一片震天的喊聲，掩着亮晃晃的刺刀，兩邊的人便肉搏起來。血流過了制服，淌在地上，給無數的脚跟踐踏着。倒下去的人，又掙扎着跳了起來。</p>
<p>「打倒一切帝國主義！」</p>
<p>那樣的喊着，拚命把刺刀向敵人那邊戳去。敵人有五小半已經丢了槍溜了，只有包圍在中間的纔爲了生的衝動，瘋狂樣的反抗着。</p>
<p>可是後邊退却的命令來了。這命令反而激起更響的喊聲，把敵人緊緊的包圍着。被逼到只能往後退的時候，大家又痛快又懷恨似的咒駡着，瞧着自家兒刺刀上的鮮紅的血跡。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c230">一二八戰蹟展覽會一瞥 <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 振甫</p>
<p>在南市的文廟，自經市政府改造以後，内部特設一二八戰蹟展覽會。遊客非常之多。我因祇怱怱一過，對於這些痛定思痛之創痕，不能作詳盡的叙述，祇好簡略的說一說。</p>
<p>踏進階石，第一個映入眼簾的，就是暴日殘殺我國同胞的利器。天井中間建着一個方木亭，亭中懸着一個六百磅重的飛機大炸彈，大炸彈的前面放着一隻半桌，桌上置的是被炸燬的吳淞大砲的殘鐵。右邊木架上裝着一個野戰砲的開花彈，右邊放着小號飛機炸彈。這些僥倖還未炸裂的炸彈，都是日帝國主義用來殘殺我國同胞的利器，我們對之究竟作何感想！大炸彈後面有兩個藥水玻璃瓶，左邊的一個浸着一隻受達姆毒彈炸毀的腿，右面的浸着一個受開花彈繫傷的手臂，浮腫的皮肉，可怕的裂痕，使我們見着更加痕恨敵人的殘酷。但這不過是千百中之一二呢，我們同胞實際所遭的殺害，還可以計數麽！</p>
<p>正對着天井的一間屋子，兩旁陳列着許多照片··如戰事發生前中日兩方交涉的文件，戰事爆發後，商務遭刦，東方圖書館被焚，和標着「蹂躪」「火」「暴行一班」等等的照片。此外充分表現我國軍民奮力抗敵的，則有我國軍隊抗敵的寫眞，和軍事工程的攝影，民衆義勇軍和女子救護隊等等。又戰爭停止後，各處殘椽頽壁，被敵人毀壞的遺跡，也都攝有照片。</p>
<p>室的左邊有許多日本小學生的慰勞作品，有文字和圖畫二種，這兒所表現的是帝國主義的傳統思想··忠君，愛國，武力侵略，凱旋勝利一類的話。</p>
<p>在這些小學生的書畫的那一端，就是胡立夫常玉清一班人的文件照片印章等等，我們看敵人的小學是怎樣的鼓勵愛國，而胡常一班國賊是怎樣的毫無心肝。相形之下，眞使人不勝慨嘆！</p>
<p>天井左邊的一間屋子，同樣陳列着幾張女義勇軍和看護的照片。玻璃架内陳着陣亡將士的小影和一二八事變的叙述，以及報告書的摘要等等。壁下掛着一件日人的僧衣，和同德紅十字會的戰地救護牀。牀布上血蹟殷然，上面標着驚心的字句，是「骨埋何處？血蹟常留！」</p>
<p>我們在紀念一二八的巨創奇恥時，我們當想想··我們應該用怎樣的禮物來酬報我們的敵人？我們有什麽準備去洗滌我們的恥辱？我們更應該怎樣盡後死者未盡的責任以無負於死難的同胞？</p>

<h3 id="c231">時代與愛的歧路（續稿） <a href="#c231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>他說着便想起那天晚上唐耀星帶他去會見有名的革命文學大家陳華民的情形來了。由陳華民向他輸入了許多革命的理論。他想把自己所輸入的一知半解的革命理論向鶴子夫人販賣。但翻想一下，又覺無聊，便忍住了。</p>
<p>那天晚上在任家裏怱怱地吃過了晚飯後，便趕到唐耀星的寓裏來，再由唐耀星帶他到一家小咖啡店裏，會見了四五位摩登文學家。他平素是頗崇仰這幾位文學家的。但見面之後，又覺得他們和自己一樣的平凡。當下他便發生了一個感想··</p>
<p>「大槪人類本身就是最凡庸的動物。」</p>
<p>他從他們領敎了許多革命理論和文藝理論，把頭腦都裝滿了。但走出來給冷風一吹，便像漏了氣的輕氣球一樣了。剩下來的只是他們的歎聲，｜｜這個說窮那個說困的歎聲。</p>
<p>想到那些文學家之稱到道苦，他便聯想到自己的荷包之不充實了。他又感着一種無理由的悲哀。</p>
<p>「今晚上又要一筆意外的開銷了！」</p>
<p>他又想吁一口氣，但忙忍住了。他伴着鶴子夫人一路走着，覺得她今夜裏是從那個日本佬手裏奪了回來，今後的她，全歸他獨占了般的。他又感着一種畸形的富於刺激性的快感了。</p>
<p>「自己完全是一個最下等的動物。大槪這是中國人特有的氣質吧。對於鶴子夫人明明抱有」</p>
<p>一種越軌的慾望，這是無恥，但已經和她出來了，一路游覽也算不得是犯罪。何以又那樣怕給他人看見，這是卑怯。想游樂便要花錢，捨不得錢便不要出來游樂。但自己儘顧着荷包，這是鄙吝。自己不長進，不能澈底地努力，只是羨拓他人的勞作的成果，這是最劣的椳性，嫉妬。······自己那裏是像俩珠所想像的那樣崇高，那樣有爲的青年呢？</p>
<p>海泉想到這裏，便覺得自己滿身都是染著了臭惡的穢物，除了馬上跳入黃浦江以外，實在無法把自己從卑劣的泥沼中拯救起來了，</p>

<h3 id="c232">一韻對與秋千對 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>「屋北麗獨宿，溪西羅齊啼，這是相傳的一韻對。其實，下聯確乎同在上平八齊韻，上　並非一韻，只爲這個北字，只爲這個北字，不在入聲一屋，而在十三歲。去年汪精衛和張漢卿爲着湯玉麟的糧餉問題，發生意見，幾乎成爲僵局；吾曾戲撲一個同韻的出聯，呌做··「汪張商量湯糧，僵僵僵··」徵求下聯，尙無應徵的人。最近接到雲間一鶴的來函，他便尋得一個同在一屋韻的下聯，呌做··「陸視撲逐竹屋，育育育。」他說··「看了唐祝文周四傑傳，才想出這個下聯，陸祝便是陸昭容和祝枝山，撲逐竹屋，便是陸昭容撲到祝屋中去，竹和祝是借用的諧聲字，育育育，是祝枝山呼痛的聲，只爲鬍鬚被陸昭容拔去一部分也。」這個下聯，眞對的匪夷所思。</p>
<p>秋千對是倒來倒去，一句成爲兩句的意思；相傳的出聯，呌做··「客上天然居，居然天上客；」一時無人覓到下聯。後來，有人對道··「人過大佛寺，寺佛大過人。」大佛寺，國中止一處；最著名的是甘州大佛寺，異常偉大和壯麗。正殿，有大佛像，任偃臥狀，長可十丈；背後，列小佛像數大尊。大佛頭枕蓮花，身披金袈裟，法像倍覺尊嚴。寺後有塔，修於唐時；寺碑建立年歲，是明萬歷二十九年；塔形下方，中圓，上尖，中藏小佛像數十尊，塔基四角，各有同樣的小塔一座。</p>
<h3 id="c233">馬尿沙土 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 定</p>
<p>｜請大衆辨辨滋味｜</p>
<p>我在市上，彷彿有人這樣說··</p>
<p>「所謂東北者，東弱而已矣！這個東北，大槪不是中國的東南西北的東北，而是另一世界的東北；假使我的話是錯，那麽爲什麽暴日鐵蹄踐踏了一年多，我們還不去奪回一寸一分的失地呢？·······」夠了我不願意再聽下去，再聽下去時，連我所站的這塊土地或許也會因而震顫起來｜</p>
<p>所謂東北，千眞萬確是中國的領土。東北二字，是包括了遼寗，吉林，黑龍江，𤍠河四省，那處的土地，比暴日大了二倍，礦産森林，都是豐富得使它們埀涎！至於人口，也有三千多萬。現在因各該地的工農們，給暴日搗亂得無工可做，無田可種；大家抱了絶大的雄心，紛紛投入義勇軍，奮力殺賊，那麽，纔有自生之路。但是他們雖然是勇敢，善戰，没有利器來作他們的抵抗。他們所有的，不過是舊式槍械和大刀，然而也足夠他們的襲擊了。聽說他們在斷絶乾糧和冷水的時候，餓了是吃沙土，渴了是喝馬尿！哟！他們也是圓顱方趾，同是我們的同胞。雖然他們是爲了想恢復各該地而奮鬥，他們正大的目的，是想恢復整個的民族！哟！醉生夢死的同胞，當他們喝馬尿，吃沙土的時候；正是你們左擁右抱，一杯葡萄汁，一客番茄桂魚的當兒呢！我謹代東北義勇軍請命，勸君省一些口腹的微資，作一點東北的救濟費！</p>
<h3 id="c234">「中」字新釋 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 施子琴</p>
<p>｜一己根本摇動了｜</p>
<p>我没有研究過文字學，對於文字學上所謂象形，會意，轉注，假借，形聲，指事，根本上不知道，至於金文甲骨更無論矣。但偏像煞有介事的來解釋這「中」字，未免要給文字學者所竊笑。不過我雖是没有這種幸運，能在書堆甲骨裏，像玩古董樣地來研究文字的演進。而我現在所要解釋的這「中」字，祇不過覺到這「中」的解釋已根本摇動，把我所見到的加以叙述而已。</p>
<h3 id="c235">病起 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 庚白</p>
<p>連日輕陰伴病中，晴光乍喜滿簾攏，。榆關昨夜軍書急，喚起詩魂更向東。</p>
<p>悄無人語一樓深，負盡星期獨擁衾，我愛定公揮涕語「英雄遲暮感黃金。」</p>
<p>「中」字的地位，在我國殆已最有威權的了。國家的名稱就是中國，最高的集權機關稱之曰中央，</p>
<p>漢代的許愼釋「中」从中从｜。這「中」字形式上雖依舊不變，然而它的解釋現在已不能再維持中立了。譬如「中」字在以前可以釋爲不偏不倚，故稱居間之調解人爲中人，然而現在自任爲中日糾紛的調解人國際聯盟，竟是偏護着日本。這不是「中」字已失去了牠不偏不倚的本義了嗎？所怪者，以中庸爲國之吾國，偏是要倚賴着這紙老虎。</p>
<p>近來劣貨傾銷吾國市塲，平民貪其價廉，均購用之。故一般提倡國貨者非常懊惱。懊惱，吳諺爲「甕中」。（此名詞这準確否，尙待瞻廬先生考證。）嗚呼！當此提倡國貨年頭，民衆如不再奮起採用國貨，一旦我國經濟破産，則非但提倡國貨之志士爲之「甕中」，而凡我國民殆亦將爲「甕中之𪔀，」而國家亦將爲「甕内之中國，」那時懊惱而「甕中」亦已晚矣。</p>
<p>以「中」字談國際，談國家，今更談一般國民。吾國民衆以不識字者居多。然而能夠識這「中」字的恐怕不在少數，或者隔壁的張木匠，對門的小弟弟看見了也會識。倘使你拿了三張各樣的「中」「發」「白」麻雀牌放在一起，他們决不會認「發財」當「中風」的。</p>
<p>總而言之，「中」字的新解釋。已非不偏不倚，而是東倒西坍了。此中國之所以稱中，實在已不中用，已成爲衆矢之的，難張虎口中的犧牲品了。</p>

<p>這一次空前國難，失地至三百餘萬方里，海外華僑非常關心，紛紛集資匯助抗日軍隊。照一般人的理想··以爲華僑總是富的，只要不慳吝，愛捐多少就捐多少，毫不爲難··可是事實上又何嘗這般容易呢？不要看報紙上迭見某處華僑捐數萬，某處華僑捐數千，就當做證實了這種理想··事實上華僑捐欵，却竟爲難得很！第一，華僑中富於資的固多；可是捐欵匯到國内的，富翁所出反佔少數，甚至一毛不拔，和國内富翁，一樣地醉生夢死，只知個人享樂，置國難於腦後。倒是小商人和勞国，能𤍠心愛國，匯到國内的捐欵，多數是這一等人的汗血金凑集而成。南洋星加坡一帶，就是如此。第二，華僑捐集欵項時，又是不易；因非少數富翁悄悄地拿出，必須有人發起捐募，便惹起各地外人政府之注意。即如南洋各屬，外人政府多不民開罪日本，惟有中國人可隨意壓迫；所以這一次國難，華僑捐募欵項及抵制日貨，都遭嚴厲取締。華僑不得已，只好改換名義，不說是集欵匯助抗日軍隊，崦謂爲救濟戰地同胞；否則固然不准募集，就是有了錢，也匯不出。華僑捐欵如是之難，豈非與一般人的理想相反嗎！論原因··自然是我國太弱的緣故，海外僑民所受痛苦，又何止這一端｜</p>

<p>鴉片，舒氣安神，生命之源。希望父親作最後一試的心，又活躍起來，母親是眼涙汪汪坐在床沿，紅葉同哥哥，遠遠跪在地上。父親掙扎了一次，兩次，三次，終於幽幽地嘆了口氣··</p>
<p>「好，你們旣有這片心，我姑且試一試。」</p>
<p>父親這一諾，彷彿求得濟顚活佛的靈丹。大家高興得走路都有了生氣。哥哥立刻雇洋車借傢伙。母親外興奮，一連呌破了四個西瓜，給傭人孩子們吃。</p>
<p>傢伙來了，父親忽生變卦。他不喜歡看見黑黝黝　髒的槍。只肯裝點泡在母親的旱烟斗裏吸。因爲他從來不曾吃過旱烟，吸了兩口，就大嗆大咳。不曉得又經過幾番苦口的敎勸，方由哥哥上斗對着火，勉强强吸了大半筒。到晚上，紅葉在油盞下看書，只聽父親搥着床，</p>
<p>「哎！愈加睡不着了！我知道是提神的東西，」</p>
<p>滿房木屑製的蚊蟲藥的濃烟，薰得紅葉只是流涙。不過，蚊子的眼，當然特别的小。依舊歡欣鼓舞而嚶鳴相求，來親近這久客他鄕的故雨。父親在床上睡不着，嚷着氣悶。紅葉替他掛上帳子，坐在床沿上，蠅拂輕輕趕着蚊子，燈光下，望父親的憔悴的臉，連眼睛都腫得只有一線。翻來覆去，只是睡不安穏，紅葉想了半天，陪着笑臉，</p>
<p>「爹，聽個笑話嗎？」</p>
<p>父親摇摇頭，「替我拿根烟來。」</p>
<p>紅葉點上一根雪茄，父親吸了兩口。覺得苦澀，丢了烟又閉上眼。滿房除了滴搭滴搭的小閙鐘，萬籟都寂。油燈盞的燈蕊，結了個大燈花，只發些綠幽幽的光。盞上的豆油，也被吸收得只剩盞底上淺淺的一暈。忽地窗子外咚的一聲，跳進毛烘烘一件東西來！紅葉嚇得汗毛直竪，妙呼的一聲，父親睜開眼，</p>
<p>「什麽東西？」</p>

<p>— 悄悄</p>
<p>黃警頑先生，誰也知道他是震動海上的交際博士；他那一舉一動很敏捷，很靈活，純任自然，不拘拘於小節，放浪形骸之外。比方說··在夏天和你周旋，便會笑嘻嘻地洽着腰，一手拿着草帽旋轉着，同時怱怱地一面鞠躬，一面跑。有時急了，會慕的兩眼一瞪，同時只見他摇摇頭，擺擺手，怒氣冲冲，大有不得了的樣子。有時病了，便和小孩子一般，懶洋洋地皺着眉頭，低聲悄語。朋友們無不以爲他是個樂天派的人生觀的人；其實他那滑稽的態度中常常含有新的創造性。</p>
<p>但是，黃先生早逾「而立」之年，還没有終身伴侶，知道的人是很少；雖然他的女友如雲。然而，朋友，告訴您！去年一二八事變以後，博士竟然和一位金陵閨女柏靜如女士，常如鶼鶼緤緤的在兆豐花園裏排演愛幕；有的朋友知道了，問他幾時訂婚，他總是含糊其詞，甚至於極端否認；在交際塲中破題兒大放其烟幕彈，可是知道這種情形的人，還是很少很少！</p>
<p>前天我忽然從綠衣人手裏接到他寄的一件印刷品，總以爲是照常的介紹文化消息，拆開一看，哦哟！原來是他和有虎畫中郎之似的那柏小姐結婚的通知書。原文很長，現在摘錄幾小段在下面··</p>
<p>「話說男大當婚，女大當嫁，我俩男也大，女也大，於是定於公元一九三三年一月二十四日在首都安樂飯店結婚。</p>
<p>我俩在這時代澎湃的怒潮中，從成婚起，誓站在人類愛的觀點上，生活平民化，······互助畢生；加入青年奮鬥的集團，改造新世界，達到人生眞正的自由平等的樂園。</p>
<p>萬分慚愧，在愛的過程中，我俩没有那哥兒小姐的風流艷史！</p>
<p>或許先生不贊成我俩的結婚式，不請證人，也不定婚約；笑駡由人笑駡，我俩結婚還是結婚。</p>
<p>我俩的結合，原非細交，却不願意大鑼大鼓驚動人家；現在敬用無限大的敬物，對先生表示，禮不收，酒也不請！靜如心邨同啟。」</p>
<p>朋友！看呀！看這一對生面别開的新婚夫婦如生龍活虎般出現在人生之大舞臺了！</p>

<h3 id="c240">賣官 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 哭</p>
<p>「吾」君曾談過賣國，我今天來談談賣官，賣國問題重大，賣官問題較小。賣國是整個國家的問題，賣官不過是局部問題，故賣國可談。賣官未始不可談</p>
<p>其實拿事實來講，我國全國之人，尙無賣國之資格，所謂賣者，一方出錢，一方出貨，必有相當之代價，試問我國任何一土地權之損失。有博得相當的代價否。我們祇有送國讓國。人爲刀俎。我爲魚肉。任人宰割之國。那裏有賣國可言</p>
<p>故我不談賣國，且談賣官，「賣官鬻爵」。原是我國傳統一貫的政策。「殷因夏禮。」損益可知但是青出於藍，大有後來居上之槪，故賣官雖同，而方法不同從前某省賣官。有知事一萬局八千。劃一不二之定價。現在此種方法。已成過去。我國别種政治没有進步。而賣官的方法則有一日千里之勢</p>
<p>現在賣官的方法奈何？</p>
<p>有所謂賣舊不賣新者，怎樣呌賣舊不賣新？其中有無窮的妙處，倘然欲出賣一官，須要估量到受主的困難。假定受主是窮措大呢。没有許多造孽錢去投資。若有造孽錢的。恐投資下去。没有相當的保障與代價。所謂「偷鷄不着蝕把米。」到也不敢輕於一擲。若用賣舊不賣新的方法。幾位縣長先生。局長。老爺。身邊已是「麥卡麥卡」普通收入若干額外搜刮若干。早已成竹在胸。自然容易投資去幹。這是一種賣舊不賣新的妙用</p>
<p>此外還附帶一個精密的件條。就是縣缺一年一萬。半年五千。倘然賣了缺。就給你長期幹下去。未免太覺便宜。所以加上了時間的限制。出五千的。祇准半年。一萬的方許一年。時間愈長。照例類推。這種賣官的方法。總算道地透了。旣可博不事紛更之名。又可居坐地分贓之實。這種計劃是何等精密而核實呢</p>
<p>官旣是出相當的代價買來。天然不顧一切拚命地搜刮。以後雀掘鼠。無微不至結果仍是老百姓的該死。官旣有相當的條件賣去。即使該官作奸犯科。枉作枉爲。老百姓雖欲至上峰去哭訴。天然也不生效力。結果也是老百姓該死</p>

<h3 id="c242">睡眠的原因 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 以玲</p>
<p>二十世紀的自然科學可算發達了，其中尤以生理學一門，百年來眞有氣熖萬丈之慨！可是，事實上尙有許許多多的生理現象我們還是莫明其妙的，現在單拿一個最普通而又極重要的生理現象｜睡眠的原因來談談··</p>
<p>假如一個人有六十歲壽命的話，那末他的一生至少有二十年的時間在睡鄕裏，睡眠對於動物的重要，是任何人都知道的，我們絶食可以支持十多天，絶飮也可以支持三四天，可是我們不能三天無睡眠。不過，「睡眠的原因安在？」就没有幾個人答得出來了！</p>
<p>『睡眠的原因何在？』這一個問題不但普通人不大明瞭，就是世界的生理學家也議論紛紜，没有一個人敢下肯定的答案，其中較有勢力的解釋是··腦缺血說，疲倦素說，和遺傳的習慣說等等。現在分别提出來談談。</p>
<p>（甲）腦缺血說｜這派解釋睡眠是由於腦缺血。爲什麽腦子裏的血會無故減少呢？據說是因爲腦動脈管縮小，腦組織因而得不着充足的營養，所以就昏昏思睡了。莫索（Mosso）氏曾就失去一大塊頭骨的人，用精密的儀器測騐的結果，證明腦脈｜即腦血管的跳動，在睡眠時較平常爲低，還有人用一種極簡單，極準確，而又饒有趣味的試騐，證明睡眠時腦子的確呈貧血現象的就是令一人挺直仰臥於一丁字形的蹺板上，同時呌他閉着眼睛，擯除一切思念，（至好睡下去），然後把蹺板移平；最後把他呌醒，同時以一简單的算學呌他計算，（r2Xr5‖？。）這時他雖未曾稍動，可是蹺板的平衡破壞了··靠頭的一端微向下傾。</p>
<p>這樣看來，好像睡眠的原因舞疑的是腦缺血了，腦缺血由於腦動脈管收縮，但是這些血管又爲什麽無故收縮，有些人睡眠的時間很有一定，何以腦血管不先不後，一至睡眠的時間便收縮起來？總之，上面的兩種試騐，僅僅證明了睡眠時的生理現象｜腦中衆液減少，而没有解釋睡眠的原因。</p>
<p>（乙）疲倦素說··疲倦素是什麽？｜是身體組織工作，（例如走路時下肢的肌肉收縮和弛張）後發生出來的一種廢物｜乳酸和炭酸氣。本來，這些廢物是隨生隨時給血液帶去的，但是，如果肌肉運動過度，廢物的産生過多，血液來不及完全把牠冲去，一部份便積蓄在肌肉裏，於是我們便感覺着疲倦了。有些生理學家便假定說··「我們所以要睡眠，是中樞神經受皮倦素刺激的原故」。曾有人用從極疲倦的肌肉裏提取出來的一種液體注射到一平常動物身上，不久這個動物便表示疲倦的現象，和昏昏欲睡的狀態。</p>
<p>可是問題來了··照疲倦素論的人講來，「勞働生乳酸」，神經被　刺激，便想睡眠；但是，初生的嬰兒絶少勞働，他的神經應該不受乳酸刺激了換言之他應當很少睡眠了，但事實上完全相反，初生嬰兒要睡二十小時，一月以後，還要睡十五六小時，以後逐漸減少，總之；年齡和睡眠的時間成反比例。疲倦素論者又何以自圓其話呢？</p>
<p>（丙）習慣說··人類在穴居野處時代，爲防野獸认間襲擊。所以一到天黑便躱伏在穴巢裏，保持着絶對的靜寂，以免被野獸聽見，久而久之變成一種一到天黑非睡不可的習慣了。</p>
<p>但是，有些人要白天睡覺的，這又怎樣解釋呢？並且此說脫離了生理學的範圍，更難令人相信了！</p>
<p>睡眠的原因何在？｜我們還不知道！</p>
<h3 id="c243">元寳茶和打抽風 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>廢歷的口號，雖已呼號了多年，但國歷直到如今，依然尙未奉行，而陰歷年也到如今没有廢除。到了陰歷的歲尾年頭，一般的人們便會用元寳茶來打抽風你如果在那時節到親戚人家或是茶坊酒館走走那非得要破鈔幾文不可。</p>
<p>上海本來是繁華的都市，唯其繁華，所以一切的費用，也比較别處來得高貴，到了廢歷的年底；你如果踏進了一家浴堂，而這家浴堂，平時你是常去的，堂倌便會笑咪咪的拿了一黃籃橘子，一荷包橄欖，放在你的前面，另外除了一壷茶之外，又有一碟橘子，和橄欖，浴罷了身，臨走的時候，你如果要棒着橘子橄欖非得要賞他們一張五元的鈔票不可，就是橘子橄欖不去拿他們，賞</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>他們堂信一元，擦背一元，茶資一元，這些堂倌還不像心而要攙你白眼，拿錢去買氣吃，想想眞寃枉呢，</p>
<p>在上海除了浴室之外，茶館之中，一般的堂倌，到了歲尾年頭，也有這套巴戲。你如果是老茶客，那麽在歲尾年頭，也要請你破鈔兩三塊的元寳茶錢，所以奔走於茶坊酒館和浴堂裏的人，到了一個年頭多少要破費些額外的費用呢。</p>
<p>抛開了上海，來一說我們的鄕下，茶館裏的元寳茶，向來是有的，不過今昔不同價格懸殊就是了，從前鄕村茶館，到了年頭，一壷元寳茶，共有十枚橄欖，你祇要給他們一二百文，四百文已非常出客，但現在非四角八角不可，高尙一些的茶館，平常名士風人所涉足的從前幾角錢，現在也要一兩塊錢呢，元寳茶的價值，也隨着物價而增高呢，</p>
<p>從我們的鄕下說到城市之中，近來故鄕松江，也倣照了上海的法子，本來元寳茶，除了十枚橄欖之外另無他物，而現在也加上一黃籃橘子，一荷包橄欖，你如果是個老茶客，這兩樣禮物，代價非二三元不可呢，都市和鄕村裏面，又顯然有一種不同的色彩，</p>
<p>在年頭的時節，你如果走到親戚的家裏，那娘姨們也會送上一碗元寳茶來，你臨走的時候，客氣一些，也要破鈔四角錢，如果平時常常去的，那非得要一元錢不可呢，至於我們鄕下，大槪是兩角錢，四角嗎，已是很出客的了，在娘姨們的眼光之中，上海的娘姨，兩角四角錢，看得很輕，但鄕下的娘姨，却已看得很重，生活的不同，結果使她們對於金錢方面眼光也是不同了，</p>
<p>橄欖爲何可作元寳，橄欖茶爲何可當元寳茶？這啞謎兒我總打不破，一般的堂倌們，娘姨們，無非是把橄欖當做了一種打抽風的利器，到了歲尾年頭，利用了橄欖說句好話，但可得一筆意外的收入，而一般的人，也都把元寳茶當做了好口彩，吃了元寳茶便可發利市，財帛進門的，所以也很願意破鈔幾文，至於那些堂倌和娘姨，我想起來他們和她們，心裏總是巴望着一年三百六十五日之中，天天是大年初一呢，這樣便可天天得獲外快了啊，</p>
<h3 id="c244">破涕錄 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 淡生</p>
<p>（一）覓寳者</p>
<p>勞林以爲這個預光不應用不注意了，三次他夢得許多貴重的東西藏匿在他室中。</p>
<p>『你是對的，勞林』，他的夫人說··「我們應該來搜尋一下」</p>
<p>那天晚上，他們費了許多時間，去敲擊牆壁，找尋可有空洞的地方，最後，居然被他們找到了，經過了一番鎚和鑿子，技巧的使用，勞林發現他是成功了，當他拆去數塊磚頭以後，那裏邊藏着的正是他夢中實現之物，排列着的銀器｜祇等着他們去搬動。</p>
<p>他們是怎樣的獰視他瘊的發現！但是當他們正議論着這些寳物變賣後的使用，當然門鈴聲大作，隔壁的鄰人跳了進來。「你們這是什麽原故，破牆到我餐室中的碗櫉内」？他喘息着說。</p>
<p>（二）援救</p>
<p>房子中已是在燒起來了，救火會人員，正在努力灌救。</p>
<p>忽然有一個女子奔到一個救火員的面前。</p>
<p>「啊」她呼着「給我救救啊」！她指着窗口··救火員就立刻飛也似的奔到房子裏去了。</p>
<p>「有多少日子了」？一個旁觀者問他。</p>
<p>「祇一個月」！那女子悲傷地回答，『看他』！｜｜當那個救火員正在回來｜｜「他没有得到」</p>
<p>那救火員走了過來說道··</p>
<p>「對不起，我没有找到那個孩子」</p>
<p>「孩子」？那女子呼起來「誰說過小孩的」！</p>
<p>「那麽｜這是什麽」？</p>
<p>「這是我的脚···脚踏車」！她啜泣起來，「我祇有了一個月」。</p>
<p>（三）模範青年</p>
<p>一個好事的老人在火車中對一個同車間的女子說··「你有子女嗎」？</p>
<p>「有的先生｜一個兒子」</p>
<p>「好福氣，他吸烟嗎」？</p>
<p>「不他從没接觸過一根香烟」。</p>
<p>「更好了，夫人，烟是有毒的。他喜歡賭博嗎」？</p>
<p>『他從未賭博』</p>
<p>「那麽我要恭賀你了。他晚上回家夜深嗎」？</p>
<p>從來没有。他在晚飯之後，就上牀安睡了」。</p>
<p>「他眞是個模範青年，多少年紀了」？</p>
<p>「至今七個月」。</p>
<p>（四）誤會</p>
<p>甲板上起了極大的騷動，奔起聲往來不絶，然後又起了一種軋軋的機器聲，引擎又好像在停下來了，那膽小旅客忙從艙内奔出來，正和船主撞了個滿懷。</p>
<p>「發生了什麽？他喘息着問，</p>
<p>「以防萬一」，船主壯嚴地說，</p>
<p>「救···命圈在那裏」？</p>
<p>「那現在和你没用了」，船主說，「從現在起你要自己防禦了，因爲我們已　　上里下　上輕下</p>
<p>盡了我們的責任。</p>
<p>他呌那膽小的乘客到艙邊說道··</p>
<p>「現在你看各人都管各人的了」。</p>
<p>那膽小的人雙手掩住了眼睛，身體戰慄起來。</p>
<p>「不不」，他呼起來；「告訴我到底怎樣了」。</p>
<p>「我們已進了港了」，船主說。</p>

<p>風刮得緊，雪花在空中飛舞。這濘滑的小道上不見人影。三五人力車，靜悄悄的停在一排草舍門前。景像是悽凉極了，如其有踏雪尋梅的詩人，一定能做出清幽絶俗的好詩來；但是這樣的景地，徧徧屬於祇知賺錢養家的勞動者。沿小道數去，第五家草舍的門半開着，似乎在等候一個人的來到。果然小道的盡頭，走來一個人影，看他走路傾斜的姿勢，就知道他心中急忙着想趕路，但又提防着别爲了不小心而跌倒。</p>
<p>人影漸漸地近來，是一個小脚婦人，手中提了一包東西，身上的一襲破舊棉衣，已完全被雪花佔領了，她好像不知道風雪的冷氣侵人，祇低着頭，在小道上跑來，衝進了那半開着的門裏。</p>
<p>屋角是張小床，睡着一個病人，不住的呻吟，似乎受不住某種苦痛的襲擊。小脚婦人走近床前，手掌輕輕的在病人額際撫摩，以推測病人的𤍠度。病人還是呻吟，並没有注意至害房裏多了一個人。小脚婦人伸手離開病人時，一雙苦眉竟深深的鎖了起來，將頭摇摇，露出無可辦法的情形；但是總還把跑了幾里路買來的一包藥，拆散了放在一隻瓦罐裏，生了一個煤球爐子，慢慢的煎着。自己移了一張破櫈，靠近煤爐，隨手取過一件男子的破衣來綴補。這時候她反而覺得身上寒冷起來，手指已經僵硬，無可奈何把破衣向櫈旁一塞，兩手反覆的就着藥罐中上升的水蒸氣取暖；但不時又跑近床前去按按病人的額際，面上老是滿團苦臉的驚嘆。</p>
<p>她想起丈夫已經病了七天，像她們這樣的人家，不做一天不没有飯吃，虧得兩個仔節省，還多着幾塊錢，預備謝年。第一回送到那個慈善醫院去醫治，號金雖祇兩角，藥費却化了一元多；看了第二回後，丈夫已不能起床了。自己每天跑幾里路，靠口頭的報告醫生配了藥方，吃下去依舊不見好，謝年的幾塊錢，當然用光了。今後的生活怎樣呢！······</p>
<p>她想着，想着，藥罐裏的藥汁却一怒氣的跑了出來，她才急忙瀘進瓦碗，捧到床前去。</p>

<p>編者先生··自從先生替我們介紹之後，我們彼此昭面過幾次；眞是傾蓋如故，相見恨晚，現在竟成爲莫逆交了。我們因爲各有各的職業的緣故，所以見面的機會很少；可是魚來雁往，書信是常相往還的。質疑問難，討論研究，差不多没有間斷過··不知不覺的中間，我們得到了不少的解决和樂趣。</p>
<p>古語說··「獨學而無友，則孤陋而寡聞」。我們做店員的青年，終年交接的朋友，常然也有幾個。但或則階級懸殊，拒人於千里之外；或則思想不同，語言無味。欲求其以學問道德相切磋者，實不多覯。現在我們兩人，雖則彼此稱得上「相交以道義」，但是兩個人的智力，畢竟有限；那末前途的成就，也就可想而知其爲渺小了。同時想到思想正確，學識豐富的青年店員中，同樣感有這種「友難」之嘆的，當然不在少數。</p>
<p>逕一再討論的結果，擬發起組織一「互助通訊社」。宗旨是想聯络一班有志上進的工商界裏的青年，互相策勵，以求自身學問道德的厲進；同是利用「羣力」，來向惡社會奮鬥，並謀一班被壓迫同志的解放。我們深知一般店員没有空閑時間的緣故，所以避免很費時間的「開會」，用通訊方法來討論問題。至於詳細章程，社員人數稍多時，經彼此討論後决定之。</p>

<p>編者按··自從本欄一再提倡「青年應組織團體」以後，就有『學術研究社』等幾個團體的設立；但是加入的人數，終覺不很踴躍。考其原因，大槪因爲開會的時間太多··各店員或因往返不便，或因格於店規，無從加入。陳洪兩君有鑒於此，想出用通主的辦法來解除這個困難，將來加入者，勢必踴躍無疑。但是天下事，有利必有弊；通信的方法，當然可使一般不能離店的店員，有加入的可能。但是日後社員一多，一個問題的提出，勢必要寫許許多多的信，偏發各社員，微求意見，豈不又成了一個困難問題罷？所以我們以爲應該出一種定期刋物，將所有的問題和答案載入；一方可免寫詐多信的手續，同時還可使一班會衆，都可見到解答的結論。不知陳洪兩君的意見怎樣？</p>

<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>㈣睛不見心不煩</p>
<p>睜開眼睛請看··馬路上來來往往的許多油頭粉面，穿羅着緞的女子，她們是靠甚麽生活的？揭開了說一句｜｜她們無非是洩慾的機器而已！再仔細觀察一下··大槪面孔長得比較標緻的女性，生活也比較的優越，坐汽車，戴金鋼鑽的女子，醜陋的極少，四肢五官，就是女子的資本，只要天賦她們一肢一官有動人的特點，就可以一生吃着不盡了。</p>
<p>女子以姿色性慾去易男子的歡心，去博一生的幸福，青年時代因出賣性慾的緣故，偶而結胎生子，那末到了年老不能供人洩慾的時候，便能倚靠兒子度日，所以女子盼望生育之心，總比男子更切，婦女過了四十歲以後，鷄皮鶴髪的醜態逐漸呈露，維繫男子愛情的力量已完全消失，自己膝下又無兒女，將來毫無指望，人生至此便絶無生趣了！</p>
<p>夏太太就到了這步田地！她想着從前青春時代，也曾與丈夫度過甜蜜的生活來，現在眼看他迷戀着一個年輕的妖精，將自己不睬不瞅的乾擱在一邊，心裏那有不氣之理。她一天天的憂鬱積壓在心中，肚子裏便積成一個氣胚。只要胃氣痛發作，就會牽動氣胚，一直上升，緊頂着胸口，連氣都喘不過來。性命就中呼吸之間。</p>
<p>她初發病的時候，仲南看了也很驚慌··後來十天半月必發一次，所謂「長病無孝子』，也就見得平常了。遇到她發病的時候，仲南得了信，祇命人去把醫生請來打一針止痛的醉麻劑，自己推說有事，竟連幾句敷衍的假安慰都不願到床前來說了。她的病因此越發越厲害。</p>
<p>幸虧她身邊有個貼心的丫頭，名呌阿麗，常常用話去安慰她，並且勸她··與其在外面看他們的嘴臉，不如回家鄕去享幾年清福，落得個耳根清淨。</p>
<p>大太太說··『我豈有不知道回去享福？祇是被人家說起來，明白的人知道我是謙她，不明白的還說是我怕她呢，再說··我走了之後，讓她獨當一面做太太，我也是不大甘心的。』</p>
<p>『太太，您回去把身子養好了可以再來的呵。』</p>
<p>『在家裏愈想愈氣，毛病更難好了。』</p>
<p>『眼不見，心不煩！總比在此地天天瞪眼受氣清淨些。』</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>普朶敷金（PudofginB·E）</p>
<p>普朶敷金生於一八九三年，畢業於莫斯哥大學。一九一四年，仍爲畫家，至一九二零年，才開始電影生活。</p>
<p>普朶敷金在電影界中，比埃森坦因更爲努力，更能從事於科學的研究。他很相信靈感（Inspiration），同時亦信賴手段(Mithod)。有人說；埃森坦因的電影有如呐喊，而普朶敷金的作品却是歌唱。</p>
<p>普朶敷金常由於劇本之要素的適當的選擇，以及由於人間的感表與人間的觀念中而産生出一種生動的力。特别是關於演出有着大的天才。這在「母親」「聖比德之臨終」中，都能引起觀衆的共鳴而達表現之最高峯。</p>
<p>如前述，他以嚴格的科學精神來製作電影，加之，他有着天賦的音樂聰慧，所以在他的作品中，常湧出着一種純粹的情緒。他努力將電影的Composition接近音樂Composition。他完全懂得；在電影中與在音樂中同樣，運動是由於影象之表現而生的。而其運動所整頓的律動，乃由影象之順序與影象之持續時間而生。所以他認定律動之重要性，在於使其效果與普通的空間藝術完全相反，使觀衆的精神作用與是影片打成一片。</p>
<p>他在「聖比德之臨終的作品中，起初很有力的攫住三個主題，這三個主題都是相對的，開始以同樣的力量鬥爭，但是在必然的展開之後，最初的二主題聯爲一線，而第三者却終於勝利。這勝利者便是革命。</p>
<p>普朶敷金的指導演員表演，那種科學簡直是無可比擬的適當。這一科學是難於輕下定義的。當然這也是他的偉大處。</p>
<p>普朶敷金在他自己的細心管理之下，常能夠展開自己而將自己表現出來。這是其他人們的失敗之點，而在普朶敷金却是成功之理由了。但是他有一唯一的弱點，那就是他過於相信了電影的Composition與他自己的學識，而不願信賴攝影機。這一點是與埃森坦因相反的。但是，普朶敷金的靈感（Inspiration）實是豐富，一切表現與感情Muaioe常從這靈感中得來。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c249">㈠自由之花 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 素以</p>
<p>鄭正秋導演的「自由之花」已在中央開映。劇本取材，隠射項城稱帝，蔡松坡設計逃出北京，到雲南去起義的一段故事。正秋是一位善唱愛國腔調的話劇專家，所以他導演這齣聲影，似乎將他生平話劇的作風完全運用到銀幕上了！他具有在通俗之中，可以激發情緒的作風，自然能引起觀衆的讚許，「自由之花」可算是明星的成功作，也就是正秋的成功作</p>
<p>以光線論，全片尙稱清晰匀衡，間有一二黯淡的片段，還不能算大疵；以發音論，雖則南腔北調，還能聽得清清楚楚，間有一二處好像演員死讀脚本，有些背誦書本的樣子，還不使人聽了討厭。全片情節非常緊凑，有集中觀衆注意力的效用。這幾點都可以說是導演，攝片，和收音三方面的成績。</p>
<p>至演員方面，胡蝶可算是成功的角色。她飾女偵探金意鴻，活顯出聰明乖巧，善於交際而心術未壞的女子，設美人計謟媚陳公岳將軍從擒陳到縱陳，那種喜，怒，哀，樂，潑辣，慈悲，啼笑皆非的矛盾情緒都能如潮湧般，在面部，胸部以及全身的姿勢上面閙潑無餘，胡蝶能這樣認眞下一番苦功夫，將來很有希望。其餘角色，如飾林大平的鄭小秋，描寫一個純潔勇敢的愛國青年軍人，妙在戇態可掬，悶坐吹簫，歎唱長歌，一種英雄義憤的氣槪已染得正秋話劇之三昧。飾陳公岳之龔稼農，裝聾作疾齋飾刁滑的配角，原是他的專長，惟飾陳將軍夫人的夏佩珍過於呆板，有些美中不足。</p>
<p>總之像這種入情入理的國産片，比較近來粗製濫造的舶來片反勝一籌，較不合理的「西洋花」國産片也高明些「自由之花」可算是值得欣賞的一張國産片</p>
<h3 id="c250">㈡霓裳仙子（Ronny） <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>這眞可以算烏發公司的大貢獻了。新光銀幕上兩小時Ponny的演出，黑暗中不絶的有人讚美。一大批歐洲的明星，雖然我們素來很隔膜，不過良好的印象是永久不會泯滅的。從故事上講，當然這是一齣尋常的喜劇，但是牠却是不尋常的影片。導演的技術很有可誇的地方。其餘如攝影等等，也不失爲完美。特别精彩的當然屬於表演了。飾王　　阮玲玉近影滬江攝現代贈</p>
<p>子的MarcDantzer眞是純粹大陸派的小生，雖然不是什麽美男子，但是非常討人喜歡。女郎KateDeNagy珠圓玉潤，唱得可以和麥唐娜比美。配角們没一個不是上駟之材。也許這劇是有一些兒戲，因爲一個王子，這樣戲迷，未免是太昏庸；而且素日以金錢玩弄女性的人，這樣結局，也好像未完似的。不過一切我們不管，牠在藝術上是超然的。全部的歌唱，歡舞，清妙的音樂，給我們無上的快感，我相信，烏發由這片起，一定能暢銷中國了。還有一點，必須聲明，牠是全部法文的。不過牠中心維繫在歌舞上，所以法語對於我們更會覺得新頴有趣，而且膠片上帶了英文譯意（每句對白都有），對於法文一無所知的人，看這片子，也不會減少興味的。</p>
<h3 id="c251">㈢活財神（IfIHadaMillion） <a href="#c251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— 靄</p>
<p>光陸蘭心同時公映的活財神，與其說是一部，不如說是七個片段凑成的。牠述一個富豪，病危的時候，用新巧的方法，把鉅量的遺産，分給若干不相識的市民。在影片中我們看見有七個不同的人，每人平空得了一百萬美金。在不同的環境中，發生了不同的結果，於是分成了各不相關的七片段。</p>
<p>末尾是反照上幕也可算一段。一個老人院中的貧婦，得了一張支票，她能利用這巨欵組了一個最完善的老人院，爲一般貧民造主。而她本人却也和那富豪交成莫逆。而富家也就不病了，「如果我得一百萬」固然不能成爲事實，但是神妙的組織，不愧是伯拉蒙劉别謙等七位導演合作的結晶品。小穿挿以及影片的技術，都不是任何一個導演所能辦到的，因爲牠太精緻了。演員有著名明星二十多人，不過每人只作短短的一段，如加昨柯柏只飾三水兵之一而已，我只好說每人都很好很盡職。</p>
<h3 id="c252">㈣「喜臨」PackupYourTroubles <a href="#c252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— 心</p>
<p>這一對明星｜勞萊和哈代｜的作品，說一句上海話，永久是「血頭」的，而且多一半是硬滑稽，這次國泰的喜臨門，眞是應時而迎合心理的片子了，所以萬頭鑽動，大家看這「喜臨門」去，情節是說他們兩個人被强迫拉入軍隊，反無意立功放回，於是多管閒事代軍隊中一個友人的孩子找祖父母受了種種困難，才無意遇着，在這兩個無意的幸運和短短的本事中，造成了無數的笑料，本來他錯盡錯絶兩片中的成績，差不多，但也没有新的進步。</p>
<p>滑稽片雖然是多一半無理取鬧，但這劇本中還有兩點淺薄的寓意，第一是美國人民對於從軍的惡恨，表示出一般作戰的心理，第二是有許多事不可强求使盲人瞎馬，胡往前追求的人，知爲警惕。</p>
<p>我想，固然是許多人認爲看了這片子，没有多笑一笑，由劇名上，得一個彩頭，我以爲去笑兩個小時對於你所付的代價，是没有吃虧，</p>

<p>他們談論着待决的婚姻問題，以及他們同到坎拿大去等等，雪妮却認爲在她母親和葛雷結婚之前也許不能就去。</p>
<p>「他們將在新年中舉行婚禮吧」，凱雷抱着𤍠望問。</p>
<p>「大槪是的，凱德；你以爲我們在坎拿大仍舊會相愛嗎！人家說地方和環境是足以改變情愛的。」她似笑似笑地說。</p>
<p>「什麽地方，什麽環境能改變我佩的愛呢？」凱德的眼睛顯示出他對這美貎小姐的愛忱。他把手挿入衣袋，拿出一隻指鐶盒子。「看，雪妮，我給你把這指鐶帶來了。你快要做我家第五代戴牠的新娘了。」</p>
<p>「凱德，你母親的訂婚指鐶！」</p>
<p>雪妮麻醉在他的懷裏，一切她所冀希的，如今已實踐了。</p>
<p>當其時，唱聖誕頌詩的歌者們。對着許多賓客們正奏樂。瑪格麗，葛雷和海絲德姑母都站在靠近他們的窗畔，欣賞那美的歌聲。爲首的歌者忽然向瑪格麗說，「范非爾夫人，我們願意特地爲人同葛雷先生唱一支頌詞呢。」</p>
<p>海絲德姑母對于他們把葛雷的名字同瑪格麗聯稱，臉色變得很嚴厲了，可是瑪格麗含笑地已問他們願唱什麽。</p>
<p>「假使你喜歡，范非爾夫人，我們就唱那「上帝保佑這家的主人｜上帝亦保佑那女主人｜」</p>
<p>瑪格麗很歡喜，似乎亦含羞。</p>
<p>他們抑揚的歌聲，引起了海絲德姑母的反響　。不得自制而隠忍到唱完，他已抱了瑪格麗離開衆人。</p>
<p>瑪格麗！你怎的許他們唱那支頌詞？希拉雷才是這裏的家主，誰都不是，祇有你的丈夫希拉雷！」</p>
<p>翌日，聖誕的早晨，桌上照常安排了三個人的早餐。海絲德姑母和瑪格麗坐着在吃，雪妮走進來，愉快地呌着··「賀你們聖誕快樂！」······</p>
<p>海絲德姑母挿嘴，「多謝我送給我的名片盒子，雪妮。」</p>
<p>「哦，那是一隻香烟盒子哟，親愛的姑母。假使今年你又送我一本禱告書，我們，大有」</p>
<p>用處呢。」她展開了放在她左道的紙包，接着說，「嘿，我早就料到了。非常多謝姑母。又贈我一本禱告書！」</p>
<p>「你把女兒敎得竟然這般對我無理嗎，瑪格麗？」海絲德姑母怒不可過了。</p>
<p>「雪妮！」瑪格麗警戒她。</p>
<p>「她以爲我同你一般的容易駕駑嗎？」</p>
<p>瑪格麗又虚張聲勢地斥責她，「那可未必，親愛的。」</p>
<p>「你想，從你同父親離婚之後，給你受苦的不是她嗎？阻撓你嫁葛雷的不亦是她嗎？」</p>

<p>Tension in Kailu and Suidong</p>
<p>Japanese Troops in Tongliao Attack Kailu Again</p>
<p>Fierce Fighting with Volunteer Army in the Dashuyingzi Area</p>
<p>Five Japanese Planes Drop Heavy Bombs on Two Counties</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Chengde reports that at 7:00 AM on the 29th, Japanese troops in Tongliao dispatched over 500 cavalrymen and 600 Mongol bandits, carrying several steel cannons and four tanks, along the Tongliao Avenue directly towards Kailu. They are now engaged in fierce fighting with the volunteer army in the Dashuyingzi area. Simultaneously, five Japanese planes flew over Kailu and Suidong counties, each dropping over ten heavy bombs. Kailu city and the nearby Majiawopu suffered heavy losses. The situation in Suidong and Kailu is tense. Various civilian groups along the Jehol border are coming to the province one after another to request Tang Yulin to issue firearms and organize civilian militias, determined to resist Japan to the death, due to the wanton bombing by Japanese planes in the Jehol area, which has left the villages of farmers completely destroyed. There was also fierce fighting between Li Haibiao's volunteer army and Japanese puppet troops in Lama Cave, Fuxin. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese 6th Division and Li Haifeng's troops are engaged in mixed combat in Majiawopu, Kailu County. The Japanese are hastily building defensive works in Kailu County and forcing our people to help dig trenches. The Suidong County Magistrate warned yesterday that the Japanese are planning to provoke Suidong again to contain our forces. The Japanese are extensively buying off Mongol bandits in Jingpeng and transporting them to Suidong and Kailu. The front lines of the Japanese army are manned by Mongol bandits and puppet troops. It is reported that the Japanese army will launch a full-scale three-pronged attack on Jehol within a week. We have already taken strict precautions. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the 25th and 26th, the Japanese army launched three fierce attacks on our Cui Brigade's positions, about 50 li from Kailu. After being repelled by our troops, they did not advance further. The front lines have been calm for the past few days. We are actively replenishing and preparing for a major offensive. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army bombed Kailu, and our Foreign Ministry lodged a protest with the Japanese ambassador. It is reported that the Japanese side has responded to our protest, stating vaguely that the Japanese army's attack on Kailu was launched in accordance with the Japan-Manchukuo Protocol, as a measure to maintain security in the Jehol River area. The wording is extremely absurd. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese have established a general command headquarters for attacking Jehol in Tongliao. After the failure to attack Kailu, they have recently transferred the "Hitomi Detachment" from Harbin, which arrived from Dahushan and disembarked in Tongliao, then proceeded to Pengguan Ridge, more than 70 li from Kailu. The Japanese army is actively making military deployments in northern Jehol and will launch a second attack soon. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The volunteer army of Feng Zhanhai, stationed in Kailu, Jianping, Xiawazi, and other places, is still replenishing and preparing for war. A portion of Ma Zhanshan's troops has arrived in Linxi and is actively reorganizing, preparing to continue the anti-Japanese work. (Ancient 10th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army has transported more than 30,000 puppet police and insurgent troops of Yu Zhishan and Zhang HaiPeng from Tongliao to Dahushan for several consecutive days, intending to use them as vanguards for attacking Fuxin. The Japanese army uses Mongol bandits as guides, puppet troops in the middle, and the Japanese army supervises the battle from behind. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain military agency received a telegram from its liaison staff in Kailu, stating that Kailu has been repeatedly bombed by the Japanese army in recent days, but the morale of the troops is extremely high, vowing to fight the Japanese army to the death. Furthermore, the volunteer army is fighting extremely bravely, and there is a great possibility of recovering lost territory. They request the central government to provide immediate assistance.

Japanese troops are engaged in fierce fighting with the volunteer army outside Jiukoukou. Artillery fire was heard in Qinhuangdao on the night of the 29th. Tsuda, the commander of the Japanese fleet stationed in Qinhuangdao, returned to Qinhuangdao from Yuguan on the evening of the 29th and is residing on a Japanese warship. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Enemy planes scouted Shimentai yesterday afternoon and dropped seven bombs, only hitting four houses. Two houses were destroyed, and no one was injured. Shortly after, over a hundred enemy cavalrymen attacked. Our troops defended the strategic Hei Shitou and used machine guns to strafe the enemy, killing six or seven before they retreated. Enemy sentries provoked our lines, intending to attack Shimentai. Enemy cavalry attacked Hei Shitou, Yinmaquan, and other places last night. Our troops resisted valiantly, and the enemy, unable to withstand the attack, retreated at 11:00 PM. The front line at the Shi River is also tense. The enemy is using military training dogs to scout our positions. Over ten of them were killed by our forces. Three enemy armored vehicles are parked inside the Yuguan Iron Factory. The number of Japanese troops in Yuguan, including Korean police, has reached over 5,000. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo telephoned last night, saying that the enemy has not made any significant moves in the past two days, with only minor contact between front-line sentries. Our positions are solid, and we are determined to fight to the death if the enemy attacks. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>

Japanese planes have been flying to the 3rd and 4th districts for several consecutive days, dropping bombs and destroying many civilian houses. Japanese planes frequently scout and drop bombs in Fuxin, Kailu, and Jianping, causing heavy losses to the people. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain party received a report from Li Zanting, the Chief of Staff of the Jehol River Garrison Headquarters, stating that over 1,000 daredevils from Geng Jizhou's volunteer army at Chaoyang Temple repelled the Japanese troops of the 3rd Keng Zheng Unit on the 29th. The two armies are still facing each other. The volunteer army of Li Haifeng and Meng Zhaotian in Fuxin clashed with the Japanese army on the morning of the 28th and are still fighting hard. Tang has been sleepless for several nights, discussing anti-Japanese plans with his subordinates and has reported to the central government and requested assistance. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Jehol Province to Ping reports that the enemy is constantly provoking us in Nanling, Chaoyang, and other places. There have only been minor contacts between sentries from both sides. Our defenses are solid. (30th Day Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Over 1,000 volunteer soldiers of Xiao Chengzhong's unit are stationed in the Lingnan area. Recently, Japanese troops mixed with puppet soldiers have been provoking the unit.

<p>(Beiping) People from Xiuyan reported that Deng Tiemei's volunteer army of over 4,000 soldiers has been repeatedly besieged by Japanese troops, but all attempts have failed.

Suzuki's brigade commander may go to Jinzhou, leaving a detachment leader stationed in Yuguan. Currently, Japanese soldiers come and go in Yuguan City day and night.

<p>1.  The New Situation of the League of Nations</p>
<p>The League of Nations' mediation of the Sino-Japanese dispute has, in fact, been declared a failure since Japan forcibly occupied the Northeast and fabricated the "Manchukuo." Moreover, with the fall of Shanhaiguan and the repeated bombing of Lingyuan and Kailu, these facts prove that the Sino-Japanese problem cannot be resolved through diplomatic negotiations and empty talk of maintaining peace. However, the League of Nations still wants to maintain its temporary facade by relying on historical empty names and only speaks of peace and advocates mediation. What it pays attention to is only Japan's so-called "facts." These facts are entirely created by military force and are very far from the prospect of peace. They also run counter to the balance of power ideal of the United Kingdom and France. For a year and a half, our country has never slightly despised the League of Nations, but what is the good intention of the United Kingdom and France, which preside over the League of Nations, towards China? To this day, we still cannot understand. Even after careful consideration, apart from wanting to break Japan's monopoly in East Asia by evenly distributing profits, it is difficult for us to admit that there is any so-called fairness and justice. Moreover, Japanese militarists wield their iron fists, tear up international treaties such as the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the Kellogg-Briand Pact, disregard international credibility, and despise human justice. They only rely on force to carry out their so-called "East Asian Monroe Doctrine." In other words, they are implementing the "Continental Policy." Our country has failed to actively engage in iron-blood warfare and is in a failed position. The League of Nations has repeatedly succumbed to Japan's so-called facts, believing that there is hope for a solution. In reality, the League of Nations cannot help but succumb to the iron hooves of Japanese militarism and seek temporary survival.</p>
<p>In fact, on October 24th of the previous year, the League of Nations Council was still able to resolve to advise Japan to withdraw the Japanese troops that were disturbing the Northeast. Although it was unable to execute it, it still dared to face the true nature of the Northeast Incident. Now, it only perfunctorily deals with matters and obscures the Washington Nine-Power Treaty, believing that restoring the original state of the three northeastern provinces is impossible. The British representative even believed that "declaring the failure of mediation is a very inappropriate move." Therefore, the spirit of the Nine-Power Drafting Committee and its meetings is also very scattered. Let alone sanctioning Japan's violent aggression. In short, it is equal to "playing the lute to a cow" to persuade the Japanese warlords, who are driven to extremes by madness, with "peaceful persuasion." There is absolutely no hope.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the major countries that control the actions of the League of Nations, such as the United Kingdom, may not necessarily have a secret agreement with Japan as reported in the newspapers, but at least they sympathize more with Japan's punishment and less with our country's good intentions. In the current situation, this may be a temporary idea of ​​appeasement, hoping to perfunctorily maintain temporary peace. However, since Japan monopolizes the Northeast, the balance of power of various countries in the Far East has been broken, and the outbreak of war is becoming increasingly inevitable. What will the nations gain?</p>
<p>2.  Japanese Military Aggression Becomes More and More Urgent</p>
<p>The more the League of Nations appeases, the more moderate our country is, and the more vigorously Japanese militarism implements its "Continental Policy" and aggression against China. Foreign Minister Uchida Yasuya publicly stated in a speech in the House of Peers that the border is the territory of the "Manchukuo." Japan will implement military force against China based on the "Japan-Manchukuo Protocol." Regarding the applicability of Article 15, paragraph 4 of the League of Nations Covenant, the Japanese Army authorities issued the following statement:</p>
<p>"The League of Nations despises its original mission and mediates between small countries that have little relationship with the Far East issue and does not recognize (emphasizing its theory). If this trend continues, the Sino-Japanese dispute will become increasingly expanded and aggravated. As for when the situation is so bad, even if we withdraw from the League of Nations, there is no fear at all, and there is no need to hesitate. However, we should continue to work hard to enlighten the League of Nations and correct its fallacies."</p>
<p>Japan's attitude of using force has become obvious. It is also building naval fortresses on the Mariana and Palau Islands under the mandate of the League of Nations. Recently, it has released the air that "even if we withdraw from the League of Nations, the Pacific Islands that are administered on our behalf may not be returned." What is the intention? It does not require our analysis. The steps of its aggression are currently concentrated on the Northeast. In the future, it may gradually reach the South Seas, India, and Australia, and it may not evolve into the same facts as the current Northeast. Let us not discuss the distant future for the time being. What is urgent today is that we must ask questions. We are in great danger, and our life and death are decided in an instant. We must assess the current situation. The Japanese army has forcibly occupied Shanhaiguan and Jiumentou and is further threatening Lingyuan and Kailu. If we do not rise up and fight to the death, I am afraid that we will not be spared from becoming Daji and Hei the second. If we are unfortunate enough to lose our border, the gateway to North China will be completely destroyed, and the enemy can drive straight in at any time. In the future, it will be impossible to recover the Northeast. The Yellow River Basin will fall into an irreparable situation.</p>
<p>To this day, all peaceful methods are not applicable to our country. Calling for help from others is also absolutely useless. The only way is to immediately rise up and use our own blood and iron to break the enemy's contemptuous and tyrannical psychology, arouse the sympathy of friendly countries, and revive our own decadence.</p>

<p>Japanese Cabinet Convenes Emergency Meeting to Discuss Instructions</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to a communiqué received by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs from the Japanese delegation in Geneva on the 30th, the Nine-Power Drafting Committee will roughly draft the recommendation case before the 4th of next month, notify China and Japan around the 6th, submit it to the Nineteen-Power Committee on the 8th, which will be explained by Secretary-General Drummond, and convene a general meeting on the 11th or 13th to discuss the matter. (30th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Drafting Committee of the Nineteen-Power Committee is scheduled to reconvene on Tuesday afternoon. It is expected that it will be able to complete the report and submit it to the Nineteen-Power Committee for deliberation at that time. Today, the secretaries are using typewriters to transcribe the first two chapters of the draft, while revising them based on the amendments and changes that the Drafting Committee has already agreed to. However, the two important issues of Chinese mortgages and Japan's September 18th actions are still suspended and have not been drafted. They will be discussed by the Drafting Committee tomorrow. It is expected that once the Drafting Committee considers these two matters, its work can be completed quickly. When these two chapters are drafted, the discussion of the third chapter will proceed. If there is enough time on Tuesday, this third chapter is also expected to be drafted. The Nineteen-Power Committee will discuss the recommendations in the final chapter on Wednesday. The staff of the Secretariat now believe that the conclusions of the third chapter will largely adopt the drafts prepared by the Secretariat, and the original plans of the Secretariat closely follow the conclusions of the Lytton Report. As for what the Drafting Committee will add, there should be conclusions on the attitudes of China and Japan towards the Covenant in the dispute, and there will also be conclusions on "Manchukuo." (30th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, people in the League of Nations said that the League of Nations General Assembly is expected to adopt the report on the Manchurian case drafted by the Nineteen-Power Committee within two weeks. As for the report, it can be roughly drafted tomorrow. At present, there are rumors that some people oppose adding the suggestion of not recognizing "Manchukuo." It is said that British Foreign Secretary Simon is also one of the opponents. The reason is that there may be several countries that want to recognize "Manchukuo." Therefore, for this matter, these people should be allowed to act according to their own wishes. Simon's speech at the League of Nations General Assembly greatly confirms the trend of the rumors that the British had hinted during the Shanghai negotiations that if the Japanese army withdrew from Shanghai, they would consider the Japanese Manchurian plan with a more friendly eye. It is also rumored that the Chinese delegation feels that the tone of the report is barely satisfactory, except for the section on recognition. (29th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Cabinet convened an emergency meeting today to deliberate on the request of Representative Matsuoka and the advice of the British envoy. Matsuoka's request asked for the Japanese government to make concessions. The British envoy also actively advised Japan to make concessions. However, in the cabinet meeting, the army's claims were very fierce, saying that if they show weakness again, the position of Japan after the establishment of the Harmony Committee will be even more difficult. It will inevitably expand the power of domestic peace advocates. At present, it is better to cut it off with one knife, hold on to the end, and prepare to fight the League of Nations. Because the army expressed it too fiercely, the Japanese government succumbed to its remaining power, adopted a tough policy, and attempted a final struggle. It also decided to entrust Foreign Minister Uchida to properly handle the situation in the future. Uchida entered the palace in the afternoon to report to the Emperor, and then convened a departmental meeting to discuss the content of the instructions. It is said that Uchida will go to Okitsu tomorrow to visit the elder Saionji to report on the process and the government's determination and seek his understanding. (30th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs commented today on the news that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had decided to order the Japanese delegation not to try to prevent the possible application of Section 4 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, saying that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet drafted the instructions to the Japanese representatives in Geneva regarding the recent developments in the Sino-Japanese dispute. According to Section 4, "If the dispute cannot be resolved in this way, the Executive Council, by a vote of all or a majority, shall issue a report stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations that the Executive Council considers fair and appropriate." What the subcommittee is currently drafting is the report mentioned in Section 4. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unwilling to confirm the rumors that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided not to oppose the application of Section 4, but said that in his personal opinion, he would welcome this move, because the uncertain situation can be ended by this. The spokesperson continued, saying that if the recommendations made by the League of Nations based on Section 4 do not meet Japan's wishes, the matter is very simple, that is, Japan and the League of Nations both recognize that their opinions are different, and then Japan can freely carry out its policies and restore the security of "Manchukuo" according to the agreement signed by Japan and "Manchukuo," without being interfered with by others. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to newspaper reports, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs telegraphed to Geneva, stating briefly that what Japan insists on is the maintenance of the status quo of "Manchukuo." If this principle is not affected, the Japanese delegation can freely conduct negotiations. However, the Japanese government is now indifferent as to whether the League of Nations will adopt Section 4 of Article 15. Officials believe that what the newspaper reports is quite accurate. It is also heard that the Japanese government has instructed its representatives to inform the League of Nations that the issue of whether Japan will remain a member if the League of Nations adopts Section 4 of the Covenant will depend on the nature of the League of Nations' recommendations.

<p>Disseminating Maps and Documents</p>
<p>Insulting Our Government</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the Japanese Embassy here in the United States began an anti-China propaganda campaign, distributing multiple maps with lengthy documents attached to American officials, political and diplomatic figures, important people, and semi-official newspapers. The intention is to support the Japanese-propagated fallacy that Manchuria has never been directly governed by the central government of Peiping or Nanjing from 1921 to 1931. Therefore, the maps sent indicate the sphere of influence of various warlords and local governments in China during these ten years, and there is a note stating that China has been turbulent in the past twenty years, and one million square miles of land is directly similar to a state of anarchy, etc. The attached documents are similar to the declarations made by the Japanese government spokesperson in Tokyo in recent months. It is nothing more than to deceive the ears and eyes of the Americans. Although it is not clear whether the Japanese dissemination of maps and documents this time also intends to support the absurd speeches made by Japanese representative Matsuoka Yosuke at the League of Nations, it is clearly visible that it is an attack on the Chinese government.

<p>Focuses on Developing Markets</p>
<p>But Labor Circles Declare Opposition</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Senator Borah recently spoke at length before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on the issue of recognizing Soviet Russia, saying that he believed this move would help salvage the world's economic depression, and would be particularly beneficial to the Far Eastern situation. After discussing in detail the issues caused by Japan's Manchurian policy and the establishment of a puppet government, Borah stated that if the United States established diplomatic relations with Soviet Russia, few important world events would remain unaffected. We must pay attention to world peace, disarmament, economic recovery, increased trade, and reduced unemployment. Recognizing Russia is related to all of these. Furthermore, establishing diplomatic relations between the U.S. and Russia would bring many important benefits. First, it would directly benefit the issues of peace and disarmament. Second, it would directly influence the recovery of trade and the economy. Russia is the largest undeveloped market in the world for American goods. Other countries are seizing various opportunities to increase trade with Russia. We often hear of disputes between this country or that country and Soviet Russia, but upon investigation, the resolution of these disputes often involves increased business relations. If the U.S. can sell more goods abroad, we can provide more jobs for our people. I heard a few days ago that a major New York merchant lost a large amount of trade with Russia to Germany, England, and France in the past two years. Now, Soviet Russia and China are the two largest undeveloped markets for American goods. I wonder what we will do when public works construction is completed, roads are all built, and the national treasury is exhausted. If we do not find markets to sell goods, the unemployment problem will remain unresolved. Therefore, we must make every effort to focus on expanding foreign trade. China has 400 million people, and Russia has 150 million people, truly the largest undeveloped markets in the world. Since we can no longer expand markets in Europe, we can only cultivate business relations with Russia to gain a large market in the future. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) American Federation of Labor President Green stated today that the AFL still opposes formally recognizing Soviet Russia until it publicly abandons "world revolutionaryism." The AFL will adhere to this principle without compromise. He stated that because leaders in American politics and business have recently launched a fierce campaign to recognize Soviet Russia, he is issuing this statement on behalf of the labor community, solely to correct the mistaken impression that labor's attitude has changed. He emphasized that all such rumors are false and that the American labor community firmly upholds this position. Green also mentioned the recent speeches by Senator Borah and Walsh advocating for the recognition of Soviet Russia, stating that while the current situation for American workers is extremely difficult, recognizing Soviet Russia would not help.

<p>National Socialist Party Leader Hitler Appointed Chancellor</p>
<p>Papen Appointed Vice-Chancellor and Prussian Administrative Commissioner</p>
<p>Blomberg Appointed Minister of Defense, Neurath Remains Minister of Foreign Affairs</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 30th – National Socialist Party leader Hitler has been appointed German Chancellor as a result of a meeting between President Hindenburg, National People's Party leader Hugenberg, National Socialist Party leader Hitler, and former Chancellor Papen. It is reported that Papen stated during the meeting that forming a government based on the principle of a parliamentary majority was impossible. Political circles expect the President to grant Hitler the power to dissolve the Reichstag and arrange new elections. The new members of Hitler's government are expected to be Frick as Minister of Interior, Neurath remaining as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Seldte, the leader of the Stahlhelm, as Minister of Labor, and Hugenberg as Minister of Economics and Agriculture. It is widely believed that Reichstag President Göring will be a minister without portfolio, in charge of Prussian defense affairs, and General Blomberg will be Minister of Defense. Hitler's efforts to form a new cabinet with a Reichstag majority failed due to the opposition of the Centre Party, which demanded that the National Socialist Party leader provide constitutional guarantees to prevent actions exceeding the constitution. Hitler insisted on appointing National Socialists to the most important ministerial positions and advocated formally recognizing the National Socialist Party's Storm Troopers, following the example of the Italian Fascist Party.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 30th – The previous telegram about the new cabinet members has now been confirmed. In addition, Papen has been appointed Vice-Chancellor and Prussian Administrative Commissioner, and Krosigk has been appointed Minister of Finance. The first cabinet meeting is scheduled for 5:00 PM today. Although the cabinet does not have a strong foundation, its members can gain the support of the Stahlhelm and the National Socialist Party's Storm Troopers. Organized labor parties strongly disapprove of this cabinet.</p>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 30th – The formation of Hitler's cabinet has resolved a crucial stage of Germany's internal political crisis. Since the spring of last year, the issue of the National Socialist Party's participation in the government has occupied an important position in domestic politics. Every change of cabinet has triggered the entire issue of the National Socialist movement within the country. The downfall of the previous Brüning, Papen, and Schleicher cabinets was due to the unresolved nature of this issue. The nature of this new cabinet is a right-wing coalition cabinet, formed by the three leaders of the right wing: Hitler, Hugenberg, and Schleicher, united to form a new mixed cabinet. Hitler being appointed Chancellor is a great success for him, and his previous repeated refusal to participate in a cabinet without him as Chancellor has now proven his strategy correct. Due to the pressure from the National People's Party and Hugenberg, Hitler finally relinquished the position of Prussian Administrative Commissioner, but because Göring was appointed acting Minister of Interior of the state of Prussia, Hitler can still maintain his influence in Germany's largest state (Prussia). The organization of the new cabinet was initiated by Papen, thus enhancing Papen's personal position. Since the famous meeting between Hitler and Papen in Cologne, Papen has continued to utilize President Hindenburg's sympathy and trust, concentrating his efforts to promote the downfall of the Schleicher cabinet, while simultaneously organizing a right-wing coalition cabinet to replace it. Although this cabinet has Hitler as Chancellor, the nationalist right-wing parties still possess considerable power. Compared to a cabinet formed solely by Hitler and Papen, this should still be considered a "presidential cabinet," as the new cabinet still lacks a sufficient foundation in the Reichstag. However, it is claimed that Hitler will conduct negotiations with the Centre Party and the People's Party within this year, to at least gain the tolerance of the Catholic parties, as these two parties have a significant influence in the Reichstag. The Centre Party's initial impression of the new cabinet is not very favorable, as the new cabinet did not include the Centre Party platform, but it has not yet issued a final decision. Hitler's cabinet will hold its first cabinet meeting at 5:00 PM today, and the new cabinet members will take their oath to the constitution at 12:00 PM noon.</p>

<p>Striving to Enlist Cooperation from the Socialist Party</p>
<p>Herriot and Paul-Boncour Agree to Support</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 29th – Daladier has been tasked with forming a cabinet today. Upon leaving the Presidential Palace, he said, "I am deeply aware of the urgency of the situation, and the solution lies in determination and resolve."</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, 30th – Daladier claims that he hopes to form a new cabinet tonight. Herriot and Paul-Boncour have both agreed to fully support him. Daladier, of the Left-Wing Radical Party, served as Minister of War in the Paul-Boncour cabinet. When President Lebrun asked him to form a cabinet, he readily accepted the task. Initially, it was reported that he had reserved his answer, which would have been a common occurrence, but it was later learned that Daladier agreed to take office immediately.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Paris, 30th – Daladier's invitation to the Socialist Party to join his new cabinet, which he is currently forming, has become the most heated topic of discussion in political circles. Daladier is willing to offer several seats in the new cabinet to leading figures of the Socialist Party, and this is a tempting offer that could cause a split within the Socialist Party. However, staunch Socialist Party members such as Blum insist on not cooperating with any other party. Unless the government's power is entirely handed over to the Socialist Party, the Socialist Party is unwilling to share any minor responsibilities within the government. It is said that many in the Socialist Party crave fame and fortune, and whether Blum's views can outweigh the selfish desires of his fellow party members remains to be seen.</p>
<h3 id="e64">U.S. Naval Construction Plan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Adding One Hundred Warships Within Eleven Years</p>
<p>Requiring an Expenditure of 610 Million U.S. Dollars</p>
<p>Navalists Seeking Passage Through Congress</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington Correspondent – U.S. navalists have now decided to vigorously promote the U.S. naval construction plan, seeking to expand the U.S. naval force within the limits of the London Naval Treaty. It is reported that senior officials of the U.S. Navy Department will seek to pass Lawrence's $610,000,000 eleven-year naval construction plan in the next Congress. This plan was previously proposed in the last Congress but failed to pass. The plan stipulates the addition of 120 warships, including cruisers, destroyers, submarines, and aircraft carriers. Among these, the construction of 18 should begin immediately (requiring a construction cost of $130,000,000). If this new plan can be passed in the next Congress, the 120 warships will be constructed sequentially, and the entire plan can be completed by 1943. Naval authorities claim that, according to the Naval Intelligence Office, based on the current strength of the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Navy can no longer be on equal footing with the British Navy, nor can it maintain a one-third advantage over the Japanese Navy (according to the ratio of the London Naval Treaty). By 1936, the U.S. Navy will drop to third place. Therefore, the U.S. Navy must urgently catch up in construction. Otherwise, when the Naval Treaty expires on December 31, 1936, the tonnage of destroyers available to the U.S. will be only slightly less than one-quarter of that of Britain and one-sixth of that of Japan. At that time, Japan's submarines will be three times as powerful as the U.S.'s, and Britain's submarine tonnage will also be superior to the U.S., exceeding it by 17,000 tons. Although U.S. aircraft carriers are superior to Japan's, they are about 36,000 tons less than Britain's. Only the 8-inch gun cruisers of U.S. warships conform to the tonnage stipulated in the London Naval Conference. According to Lawrence's proposal, what is planned to be built in the next fiscal year will be one aircraft carrier, two light cruisers, one destroyer leader, eight destroyers, and six submarines, to be built within three to four years, costing a total of $130,000,000.</p>
<h3 id="e65">Huge Military Expenditures: Japan's Budget Difficult to Balance <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 30th – The large budget for the emergency situation has been debated in the Diet for days. As of today, the most obvious points from the questions and answers between the Diet members and the government authorities are summarized as follows: 1) Although the measures to address the emergency situation and the relief measures are limited to a certain period, there is no guarantee that relief measures will not be needed after that. 2) Although there is hope to reduce the costs of the Manchurian Incident from Showa 10 (1935) or Showa 11 (1936), a considerable amount will still be required regularly. 3) The improvement of military equipment will be carried out within the scope of the remaining 412 million yen from the Defense Enhancement Continuing Expenses, after deducting the 101 million yen budgeted for the 8th fiscal year. However, this continuing expense will continue until the Showa 21 (1946) fiscal year. Even if it is accelerated, it must be completed by the Showa 10 (1935) or Showa 11 (1936) fiscal year at the latest. After that, a flexible national defense plan must be established. 4) Low-interest refinancing of public bonds cannot achieve the ultimate effect on finance. 5) Due to the inflationary policy, prices are rising, and the budget expenditures are bound to increase. The current Minister of the Navy intends to propose an additional budget for this reason. From this, it can be seen that there is little sign of Japan's finances recovering to balance in the next few years, and on the contrary, expenditures are likely to increase gradually. In particular, the budget for the 9th fiscal year is bound to be more inflated than this year's. At the same time, there is a tendency for revenue to increase the deficit.</p>

<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 30th – Hatta, the president of the South Manchuria Railway (Mantetsu), who is currently in Tokyo, is in discussions with the government regarding the Mantetsu capital increase plan. Once decided, it will be submitted to the Diet for approval. Regarding the amount of the capital increase, Mantetsu, the military, and the Ministry of Colonial Affairs advocate doubling it, for use in railway construction and various industrial development projects. At a minimum, it should be increased by more than 800 million to meet current urgent needs. Some believe that the industry of Manchuria is the reason for this, and therefore Mantetsu should be made independent. External matters require caution, so the funds need not be raised entirely through capital increases, but can be obtained through corporate bonds within a certain range.</p>
<h3 id="e67">Colonial Affairs Minister Nagai Impeached for Attending Funeral <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 30th – The Japanese House of Peers learned that Colonial Affairs Minister Nagai had attended the funeral of Sakai Toshihiko, a former elder of Japanese socialists, which caused great indignation. It was decided to summon Nagai to the House of Peers on the 31st to question him. The reason is that although Sakai Toshihiko was a member of the Tokyo City Council before his death, and Nagai was his old friend from his time as a professor at Waseda University, Sakai was an elder of socialists who was arrested for participating in the first Japanese Communist Party incident in 1923. Although he later left the Communist Party, his historical activities cannot be erased. For the Colonial Affairs Minister to pay respects to the soul of a socialist in public is tantamount to aiding and abetting the development of socialist thought. Under the current state of ideological deterioration, he should not have acted so carelessly and disgracefully. The stubbornness of the Japanese nobility has reached such a degree, showing how difficult it is to be a Japanese official in 1933.</p>

<p>Peruvian Government's Reply Note Fails to Satisfy the U.S.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Lima, 29th – Today, Peru and Colombia began direct negotiations. Colombian Special Envoy Dr. Ortiz arrived here today and immediately met with Peruvian President Cerro. It is reported that the two countries have agreed not to open fire in Leticia and to resolve the matter peacefully. However, while the meeting was in progress, it was reported that Colombia's main fleet, consisting of three gunboats and one transport ship, had reached the confluence of the Amazon River and the Putumayo River, only a short distance from Leticia, and was continuing to sail upstream. However, according to unconfirmed reports, the commander of this fleet has been ordered not to advance westward without further orders.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Lima, 28th – The Peruvian government tonight replied to the U.S. State Department, stating that the Peruvian military will not violate the Kellogg-Briand Pact in resolving the Leticia issue, but insists that Peruvian residents in the city must be protected if Colombian troops attack it.</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency, Washington, 28th – Today, the U.S. State Department believes that the Peruvian reply note is unsatisfactory because it still fails to eliminate the possibility of armed conflict. The U.S. government previously sent a note to Peru, pointing out that its occupation of Leticia by force and its refusal to return it violates the Kellogg-Briand Pact. However, Peru's attitude is that it will not withdraw from the city until negotiations have been conducted and conditions have been exchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e70">The Fate of the Saito Cabinet in Japan (Japan Communication) <a href="#e70" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c70" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">70</a></h3>
<p>The 64th Diet of Japan has officially opened. How the Saito national unity cabinet is managing affairs has been well known to the Japanese people for the past six months. Its lifespan also depends on this Diet session. The most pressing problems facing Japan are its domestic politics, which are in extreme turmoil, in addition to its aggressive military aggression. Since the assassination of Prime Minister Inukai by young army and navy officers on May 15th of last year, Japan, a so-called constitutional state, has entered a state of instability and emergency. At the upper echelons of politics, control is purely in the hands of the old clans; at the very least, it is a joint dictatorship of the Satsuma and Choshu clans and the army and navy. In general society, the unemployed clog the streets, and starvation prevails. Even if the government tries its best to smooth things over, stimulating industrial prosperity with military industries and hoping to restore the market and alleviate unrest, the results are ultimately limited. Thus, the government calls upon the people, saying, "In this time of emergency," we must implement emergency policies. The Saito Makoto cabinet is a cabinet for this emergency. The general ostrich-like capitalists and liberals in Japan believe that the sole mission of the Saito cabinet is to overcome the emergency state and return to normalcy, and that Japan's politics over the past six months have returned to normalcy and can enter the "constitutional norm" of parliamentary politics, with the Seiyukai, which holds 299 seats, emerging to take power. The answer to this question is extremely simple.</p>
<p>First, Japanese politics has not only not returned to "normalcy," but its emergency state is becoming more urgent. The underground leftist movement within the country is particularly thriving. Revolutionary theories have deeply penetrated the general working class and peasant masses, and have even infiltrated various military groups. Everywhere in right-wing groups, there are traces of communism. For example, the firearms used by red secret organizations mostly come from right-wing groups. Figures like Dr. Kinunosuke Otsuka, who are among the best in academia, are now all drawn into the red atmosphere. The sacred judiciary has also recently experienced red cases. Judge Masamichi Ozaki and Chunosuke Sakamoto of the Tokyo District Court have both been communized. This incident shook the entire country and fundamentally undermined Japan's current politics.</p>
<p>Second, the military dictatorship is becoming more blatant. This year's budget has increased by more than 35 million yen. In addition to the 820 million yen budget, the recent deployment of six new divisions has added another 20 million yen. This huge expenditure on military affairs demonstrates Japan's aggressive intentions and intensifies its so-called emergency state.</p>
<p>Third, the economic panic in rural villages is becoming more severe. Although general prices have risen due to the inflationary policy, wages and agricultural income have relatively declined. The so-called measures to address the emergency situation are purely for the relief of the propertied class and have nothing to do with the common people.</p>
<p>Fourth, the use of troops in North China has begun. If China were to resist, and the war were to last for a year or two, Japan would be unable to bear the burden of military expenses and would undergo a transformation. Even if the Japanese army occupies Jehol and eastern Hebei, it would still be necessary to add two to five divisions to the army to defend them. The military expenditure burden would be double what it is now. The temporary excitement of the Japanese military is further prolonging its so-called emergency. With these four factors, the Saito emergency cabinet has become somewhat complacent. The current Diet session cannot but be cautious. The "budget bill" is the greatest hurdle for the Saito cabinet. There are many points that can be criticized and pointed out, providing ample material for debate in the Diet. For example, the measures to address the emergency situation are large but ineffective, and the military expenditure causes suffering for the people and earns international condemnation. However, if the measures to address the emergency situation are reduced, some of the Seiyukai's social base – landlords and usurers – will rise up in opposition, causing an accident in the Seiyukai's fundamental base. Therefore, they dare not have different opinions on the measures to address the emergency situation. The military expenditure is even more powerful than the measures to address the emergency situation. Who dares to challenge the army's anger, which is armed with guns and swords, by raising the banner of protecting the Japanese Empire?</p>
<p>Besides this, there are no "valuable issues" sufficient to challenge the government and win the trust of the Japanese people. Therefore, even if the Seiyukai wants to actively seize power and abandon its self-respecting stance, it is forced by the environment to have no more effective method than self-respect.</p>
<p>In the 64th Diet, if the Seiyukai urgently rises up to overthrow the Saito cabinet, it is not impossible. However, if the power can be handed over to the Seiyukai after the Saito cabinet falls, the Seiyukai will definitely make a desperate attempt to replace Saito. But according to the current political situation in Japan, everything must be controlled by the military. The Seiyukai's hope of forming a cabinet is extremely small. It is feared that the successor after Saito falls will be even more authoritarian than the current Saito, and the political situation will be worse than it is now, or it will be largely controlled by the military, or even completely controlled by the military, or even a purely military cabinet. Therefore, the Seiyukai and the Minseito must be cautious in everything to preserve a glimmer of hope for constitutionalism. Even Takashi Hara, who is old and respected, must still rely on the military's nod of approval. The situation is even worse for others. If the Seiyukai and the Minseito are willing to unite and form a cabinet together, it may still be possible. However, both the Seiyukai and the Minseito are controlled by the zaibatsu and are extremely dissatisfied with most young military officers. The decline of parliamentary politics is an inevitable trend of the times. In addition, Japanese political parties have lost all credibility. Even if they form a cabinet, it would only be a puppet of the military. Moreover, the Seiyukai has an absolute majority of seats, making it difficult for the two parties to continue to cooperate. Therefore, although the Saito cabinet cannot overcome the emergency state and cannot meet the hopes of the capitalists, it still has the possibility of surviving the 64th Diet. The Japanese political situation will inevitably continue to waver, and the military will continue to control it in order to muddle through its national affairs. As for foreign affairs, it will continue to be aggressive. (Sent from Tokyo on January 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e71">Japanese Attempt to Disturb Shandong <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Using Chinese Traitors Disguised as Refugees</p>
<p>Secret and Deceptive Movements of Japanese Police</p>
<p>Sakakibara's Suspicious Visit to Qingdao</p>
<p>A Shanghai South communication: Since the September 18th Incident, Chairman Han Fuqu of the Shandong Provincial Government has been deeply concerned about maintaining order, given that the province is at the forefront of defense, borders the Northeast, and is home to a mix of Chinese and foreigners, especially Japanese. Recently, with the fall of Yu Pass, precautions have become even stricter. However, in recent days, the Japanese have indeed been plotting against Shandong. Their method remains the use of Chinese traitors, such as Cheng Guorui, to send people disguised as refugees, under Japanese protection, from Dalian to Qingdao by disguising as overseas Chinese. Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie has been on guard against this and has already captured several people, but they are all second or third-rate figures and lack the ability to cause any disturbance. Major General Sakakibara of Japan recently followed Duan Qirui to Beijing, and his trip from Beijing to Shanghai was to secretly observe what negotiations Duan had with the government. A few days ago, Sakakibara again took the Fengtian Maru from Shanghai to Qingdao, anchoring for four days but not coming ashore. However, many Japanese people went to visit him. On the 27th, Sakakibara took the same ship to Dalian, reportedly planning to go to Tianjin and then return to Shanghai, with some hidden agenda. The authorities are on high alert, and morale has not died. People sent by Cheng Guorui have already informed the authorities, and their plans for causing trouble are fully known. Japanese police in Qingdao and Jinan have recently been frequently traveling along the Jiaoji Railway in plain clothes, their movements unusually secretive. What their intentions are remains unknown. Japanese people in Zhangdian, Fangzi, and other places along the Jiaoji Railway also frequently hold secret meetings, but the details are unclear. Furthermore, officials have repeatedly received reports that many people claiming to be commanders of the National Salvation Army are active in Shandong. The authorities have ordered military police in various locations to pay close attention. Just yesterday, a certain Wang, who falsely claimed to be the commander-in-chief and division commander of the pseudo-National Salvation Army, was arrested in Qufu. Subsequently, another division commander was arrested. According to their confessions, they intended to contact the Wuji Tao Red Spear Society and others in the Tai'an and Qufu areas of southern Shandong to plot something. In addition, four other pseudo-division commanders have also come to Shandong. Han Fuqu has ordered these criminals to be sent to Jinan for detailed interrogation and then dealt with accordingly.

<h3 id="e72">Shantou Organizes Public Air Defense Committee <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>Auctioning Confiscated Enemy Goods to Raise Funds</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee Members Already Selected from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>A Shantou communication: Since the establishment of the Anti-Japanese Association, the people of Shantou have registered and sealed up all enemy goods in various shops, prohibiting their sale. For more than a year, this has been very effective, and shops selling enemy goods have gradually closed down. Occasionally, unscrupulous merchants secretly transport cloth, miscellaneous goods, Korean ginseng, alcohol, white sugar, etc., but they are caught and punished by the National Salvation Association, either by sealing the shop and parading the people through the streets, by burning their goods, or by sinking the enemy goods into the sea, in large quantities. Unscrupulous merchants are increasingly frightened. Merchants who generally transport enemy goods have repeatedly created [spaces in original] enemy goods [spaces in original] in the past six months. On the 16th of this month, the Municipal Party Department suddenly received an order from the Provincial Party Department, instructing it to notify the Anti-Japanese Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to allow all the soybeans and bean cakes previously sealed up by the Anti-Japanese Association to be unsealed and sold. After this order was issued, all sectors of the city were shocked. The Federation of Labor Unions, the Federation of Students' Unions, the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, and other organizations all sent telegrams opposing it, with very strong wording. However, the Provincial Party Department still did not want to change its original intention and immediately sent Secretary Huang Linshu and Zhou Tang, a secretary of the Provincial Government, to Shantou, seemingly on a reconciliation mission. Huang also told people that public opinion should be taken into account regarding the unsealing matter, but since it had been decided by the Provincial Party Department and the Southwest Executive Committee, the principle could not be changed. Huang's remarks show the intention of the Provincial Party Department. At the same time, the call for the organization of a public air defense committee in Shantou has risen, following Guangzhou. On the evening of the 20th, people from all walks of life held a discussion meeting at Lizhe Society, and on the afternoon of the 21st, they organized a public air defense committee. About one hundred representatives attended the meeting that day, discussing various proposals and debating fiercely. In the end, they still passed the proposal to unseal all enemy goods in the city, and the proceeds from the auction would be allocated 50% to air defense expenses. In addition, they would borrow two months' rent from the citizens, collected in two installments, borne by the owners. Shops must pay a commercial license tax, calculated at 5% of the capital. There are no statistics on the value of the enemy goods sealed up in Shantou, but it is said to be roughly about one million two hundred thousand yuan. If 50% is allocated, it would be at least five million yuan. On the same day, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Hotel Association, the First Municipal High School, Tongji High School, the Telegraph Workers' Union, the Iron Workers' Union, the Overseas Chinese Mutual Aid Society, the Municipal Education Association, and various National Salvation Associations were elected as members of the public air defense committee. It is expected that the committee will be established in the near future.</p>

<p>The Martyr is Suspected to be Han Shupeng</p>
<p>= Pursued by the Enemy, He Escaped into the Mountains and Became a Farmer =</p>
<p>= After Living for Two Months, He Disguised Himself as a Taoist Priest and Escaped the Lion's Den =</p>
<p>A Beiping communication: Han Deming, the nephew of Han Liru, the former acting chairman of the Heilongjiang Provincial Government, came to Beiping with Han's family the day before yesterday. According to Han Deming, the details of Han Liru's escape are as follows:</p>
<p>"Chairman Han (Liru) is my uncle. He previously served as the magistrate of Luobei County. In addition, I escorted the Chairman's family to Beiping. I did not know about the rumors of my uncle's martyrdom when I was in Heilongjiang. It was only after arriving in Beiping that I learned that people in Beiping believed my uncle had died in Heilongjiang long ago. In fact, after Chairman Ma was surrounded by the Japanese army in the battle of Daqingshan, his Chief of Staff Han Shupeng disappeared in Heilongjiang and has not been found since. My uncle's name is Shuye, so when the telegram was sent to the mainland, it was mistaken for my uncle's martyrdom. At that time, my uncle was pursued by the Japanese army and escaped into the mountains. He lived in the mountains for two months, changed into farmer's clothes, and lived with opium-smoking bandits and those who gathered mushrooms and fungus. The suffering was indescribable. Later, he disguised himself as a Taoist priest and left the mountains alone. At that time, there were Japanese soldiers stationed at all the mountain passes, but when they saw my uncle dressed as a Taoist priest, nothing unexpected happened. After escaping, he went to find Chairman Ma, who was in Nehe at the time. When Han was in the mountains, Chairman Ma's subordinates mistakenly believed that my uncle had defected to Ding and Li, so when Ma sent a telegram from Nehe, he said that Chairman Han Liru had absconded with funds and issued an arrest warrant, sealing up all the family's belongings. After escaping from the mountains, he sent Deng Wen to see Chairman Ma to explain the misunderstanding. Therefore, after seeing Ma, he remained Ma's secretary-general. Ma immediately revoked the arrest warrant and returned the sealed property. When Su and Ma failed and entered Russia, my uncle accompanied Su and Ma into Russia. He disguised himself as a soldier in Russia and is now in Moscow. It is said that someone received a telegram stating that Su, Ma, and others have already departed from Russia. My uncle should also return to the country to continue the fight against Japan. This time, sending the family to Beiping was also his idea, as he informed Heihe by telephone when he met Ma in Nehe, and so on."</p>

<p>Lu Yongxiang Also Donates 6,000 Pairs of Wool Socks</p>
<p>A Beiping communication: Feng Yuxiang is one of the strongest advocates for armed resistance against Japan. Concerned about the soldiers on the front lines, who are defending against a strong enemy in freezing weather, he has personally raised 50,000 yuan from various sources to purchase 10,000 military leather vests, distributing 3,000 to Zhang Xueliang's troops, 2,000 each to Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, and Sun Dianying's troops, and 1,000 to Gao Guizi's troops. Feng also sent a letter to Zhang Xueliang, expressing his condolences. The original text is as follows: "To Brother Hanqing, With the fall of Yu Pass, North China is in danger. The ambition of the violent Japanese is growing. I am deeply comforted to hear that you are planning to defend and support in difficult times. I am living in seclusion on the frontier, with national worries on my mind, and I cannot express my grief and indignation. Recently, I saw in the newspaper that the soldiers on the front lines who are killing the enemy are braving bullets and severe cold, and dying not only in battle but also from the severe wind and snow. This is extremely painful. With a formidable enemy at hand, I cannot share the hardships with the soldiers on the front lines. I am ashamed and remorseful. I have recently raised a small amount of money and rushed to make 10,000 long leather vests, entrusting comrades Deng Zhongzhi and Li Shifu to send 3,000 of them. Please inspect and accept them and distribute them to the soldiers on the front lines for warmth. The remaining 7,000 have been distributed to the troops led by Comrades Meiming, Zhegeng, and Chen Pei Wu. This small contribution is not enough, but if I can raise more funds, I will continue to do so. This is only the utmost of my ability in a desperate situation. Furthermore, the wounded soldiers in this Yu Pass battle are tragic and glorious sacrifices. I cannot personally express my condolences, but I cherish my admiration. I have prepared some gifts to be sent together, and I hope you will pass them on to the brave soldiers. These humble items are a token of my respect. The enemy's ambition is deepening, and national hatred must be avenged. I hope you will take care of yourself for the future. The letter does not express all my thoughts. Respectfully wishing you effort, Feng Yuxiang, the 19th day of the 1st month of the 22nd year."</p>
<p>Lu Yongxiang, the former governor of Zhejiang, has been living in seclusion in Tianjin since he resigned from office, devoted to Buddhism and indifferent to worldly affairs. However, his patriotism is as strong as ever. After the Yu Pass disaster, the He Brigade fought bravely against the enemy, sleeping on their weapons and shedding blood in the freezing weather. Their divine power, loyalty, and bravery are admirable. Seeing that various National Salvation Associations are collecting donations for consolation, and those who contribute are extremely enthusiastic, he generously donated 3,000 yuan and personally purchased 6,000 pairs of high-quality wool socks, specifically designated for the He Brigade. This shows that the Chinese people are extremely united in their resistance against Japan, regardless of their social status. (25th)</p>

<p>Valued at 70 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Transported by 100 Ships</p>
<p>Australia had an excellent wheat harvest last year. Due to excessive inventory, the country sold it to China at a low price. It is reported that the Australian wheat purchased by various flour mills in China totals 1.38 million tons, valued at 68 million yuan at 50 yuan per ton. The reporter of this newspaper believes that the import of foreign wheat has a significant impact on the diet of our people, so we went to various parties to conduct a thorough investigation and will record the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Purchase Quantity In order to provide relief to the national flood disaster last year, the Ministry of Finance purchased 400,000 tons of American wheat for the construction of the Jianghan-Huaihe levee as a work-for-relief program. Australia had a bumper wheat harvest last year and had excess inventory, so it sold it to China at a low price. Flour mills in China rushed to sign orders, and the total number of transactions reached 1.38 million tons, totaling 23.135 million stones. The quantity is one and a half times more than the American wheat purchased by the national government. At the average low price of 50 yuan per ton, it also requires 68 million yuan, and the actual price is likely to be even higher.</p>
<p>Shipment After the Australian wheat was purchased by various flour mills, it was chartered by Australian cargo owners for shipment. It is reported that both parties have agreed to ship it to Shanghai in one hundred shipments. All shipments are loaded at the port of Sydney, Australia. Australian cargo owners have chartered one hundred British and Nourished Lun ships for shipment. The Shanghai side is responsible for carrying this large quantity of wheat to Shanghai by Tianxiang Shunheng and other companies. The freight per ton is calculated at 13 shillings. The freight alone requires 15 million yuan.</p>
<p>Arrived Wheat The first batch of Australian wheat shipped from Sydney to Shanghai totaled approximately 140,000 tons. Fifteen Nourished Lun ships were dispatched to Shanghai for shipment. According to the reporter's detailed investigation, the following ships have already arrived in Shanghai: ㈠ Dar Yin arrived with 7,778 tons, ㈡ Eng Luo Kannada arrived with 9,109 tons, ㈢ Dar Kelos arrived with 7,384 tons, ㈣ Dar Fanluo arrived with 7,699 tons, ㈤ Xuetini arrived with 113,990 bags, totaling 9,050 tons, ㈥ Eng Luo Panwei arrived with 7,500 tons, ㈦ Gelinweishi arrived with 7,714 tons, the above seven ships totaled 56,234 tons. According to yesterday's telegram, the Basweishi and Aisilehua ships are also carrying more than 15,000 tons of Australian wheat and are scheduled to arrive on February 2nd and February 6th, respectively, all unloaded in Shanghai. It is heard that the United Company is responsible for handling all the handling and unloading of the Australian wheat. The remaining large quantities of wheat are being shipped continuously.</p>

<p>Yesterday, a joint letter from the Shanghai Woolen Fabric Industry, Paper Industry, and Silk Fabric Industry, and other 41 trade associations stated that the Sino-Japanese Tariff Reciprocity Agreement signed in 1930 is about to expire and requested that the government not continue it. They sent a telegram to the Chambers of Commerce in various provinces and cities, unanimously advocating this position. The original telegram stated: "We have already telegraphed the government regarding this matter, advocating that it should not be renewed after the expiration. The subsequent letters from various trade associations point out the advantages and disadvantages from both political and commercial perspectives, and the arguments are very clear. They state that there is no possibility of continuing negotiations until the invaded land is returned. In today's diplomatic situation, the only way to seek containment is to do so. Otherwise, if Japan has already encompassed the land of the three northeastern provinces, and we continue to use the interests of our commerce, there is no such way of serving the country in ancient or modern times, at home or abroad. There are only three months until the expiration date, and we are deeply afraid of missing the opportunity. We are urgently informing you of the situation and hoping that you will unanimously advocate that the government adopt and implement it. We are extremely grateful."

<p>Regarding the approaching expiration of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement, they sent a telegram to the National Government, requesting that a new treaty with true reciprocity be negotiated. The original telegram states: "To Chairman Lin of the National Government in the capital, Chairman Jiang of the Military Committee, Acting President Song of the Executive Yuan, Minister Song of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry, We have investigated the Sino-Japanese Tariff Reciprocity Agreement and found that it benefits them greatly and us very little. It provides substantial benefits to them but only nominal benefits to us. It is completely beneficial to them and harmful to us. A major mistake has already been made, and our country is suffering endlessly. Fortunately, the agreement is about to expire. We sincerely request that you resolutely abolish it and negotiate a new treaty with extreme equality and true reciprocity to save our precarious industries and benefit the livelihood of our people. We are extremely eager and expectant." Printed by Wang Jie'an, Wang Hanqiang, and Wang Xingyi, standing committee members of the China National Goods Maintenance Association.</p>

<p>Increase Revenue, Reduce Expenditure, and Solidify the Economies of the Two Railways</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways is Diligently Studying the Restoration Plan</p>
<p>Minister of Railways Gu Mengyu arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday from Beijing to discuss important matters such as the restoration of the two railways. Yesterday, he went to various places to discuss matters and is scheduled to return to Beijing within two or three days. A reporter from the Central News Agency drove to Mr. Gu's residence yesterday morning to ask about the restoration plan of the two railways. According to his account, it is as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e90">Shanghai-Suzhou to Lay Double Tracks <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>The two railways have suffered huge losses due to poor management in recent years. They were also severely affected by the Shanghai War last year, resulting in even greater losses. If immediate rectification is not carried out, the situation will become unbearable. The Ministry of Railways is diligently studying the restoration plan for the two railways. The most urgent task at present is to consolidate the economies of the two railways. The method is to increase revenue and reduce expenditure simultaneously, so that income increases and expenses decrease, and the economies can be consolidated. Then, the railway restoration can be discussed. For example, ㈠ The locomotives and vehicles of the two railways are all 30 years old and need to be purchased immediately. ㈡ The rails and sleepers of the two railways are also old and need to be replaced immediately. ㈢ Most of the passengers on the two railways are third- and fourth-class passengers, but no attention has been paid to the equipment inside the third- and fourth-class carriages. We will immediately reform this to improve hygiene and comfort for travelers. Regarding the request to reduce third- and fourth-class fares, it cannot be implemented due to its impact on national treasury revenue. ㈣ The Jinghu Railway is crowded with passengers. The Ministry of Railways has decided to add double tracks to the railway to increase the number of services and avoid crowding. We will first lay the section from Shanghai to Suzhou, as the roadbed for adding double tracks has already been built. After the rails and sleepers are purchased, construction can begin within the year. The double tracks of other sections will be delayed due to roadbed issues. The various debts of the two railways are currently being repaid.</p>

<p>Due to the construction of new railway stations, the seizure of civilian land has repeatedly been opposed by the villagers of Pengpu Township, who have sent representatives to Beijing to petition. This issue remains unresolved. The matter has now been transferred to the joint handling of the four ministries of the Interior, Military Affairs, Industry, and Railways, as well as the Shanghai Municipal Government. A meeting was held in Beijing at the beginning of the month, but no conclusion was reached. A second meeting will be convened soon to continue discussing solutions, so as to complete the Ministry of Railways' plan as soon as possible, while also taking into account the interests of the villagers. It has not yet been decided whether representatives from Pengpu Township will be invited to attend the second meeting.</p>

<p>Regarding the Shanghai Municipal Government's previous request to transfer the Songhu Railway to municipal management, the Ministry of Railways has carefully considered the matter and deems it impossible. This is because the railway was built with loans from British merchants, which have not yet been fully repaid. Moreover, there are significant outstanding payments for materials purchased over the years, which also remain unsettled. Due to these reasons, it is not possible to transfer the railway to municipal management.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Sir Miles Lampson, the British Ambassador to China, arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Mayor Wu hosted a banquet at his residence on Haig Road yesterday afternoon to welcome the ambassador. Former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, former Ambassador to the United States Wu Chaoshu, British Embassy Counselor Ingram, Secretary Teichman, and British Consul-General Brenan were also invited to attend. The banquet concluded in high spirits around 2 PM. The ambassador, accompanied by Ingram, Teichman, and several attendants, boarded the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s "Suiho" steamer last night and set sail for Beijing this morning to visit with Chinese foreign affairs authorities. He will stay in Beijing for about a week before heading to Peiping. During his stay in Shanghai, the ambassador met with Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi Akira twice for lengthy discussions. It is reported that the British ambassador was instructed by his government to inquire about Japan's views on the draft report being prepared by the League of Nations and to urge Japan to make some concessions so that the League of Nations could save face. It is also rumored that a secret understanding was reached between Britain and Japan during the signing of the armistice agreement last May, but both the British and Japanese diplomatic authorities in Shanghai have vehemently denied this. As for the ambassador's visit to Beijing, rumors suggest that he is tasked with facilitating direct negotiations between China and Japan. This is purely speculation, as the entire Sino-Japanese issue has been submitted to the League of Nations for resolution. Before the three northeastern provinces are returned to China, direct negotiations between China and Japan are impossible. According to information from the Japanese Embassy, Japanese Ambassador Ariyoshi Akira is also scheduled to enter Beijing today.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Full Text of Li Guojie's Appeal <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Listing Four Points of Objection</p>
<p>Suzhou Dispatch: Former General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC), Li Guojie, was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the Shanghai District Court for breach of trust and dereliction of duty for signing a contract in September of last year to mortgage the real estate and wharves of the Shanghai CMSNC to the American China Corporation at an interest rate of nine percent per week, borrowing two million taels of Shanghai silver, and delivering 700,000 taels of silver in advances from former CMSNC Supervisor Chen Fumu. Li Guojie, dissatisfied with the verdict, retained lawyers Zhang Yipeng, Sha Xunyi, and Jiang Yiping to draft an appeal to the High Court in Jiangsu. It is now known that the court hearing is scheduled for February 15. The full text of his appeal is transcribed below:</p>
<p>Criminal Appeal Petition Appellant: Li Guojie. Defense Attorneys: Zhang Yipeng, Sha Xunyi, Jiang Yiping. Submitting this appeal due to dissatisfaction with the sentence imposed by the Shanghai District Court.</p>
<p>Grounds for Appeal: The appellant was prosecuted by the prosecutor for matters related to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. The judgment of the Shanghai District Court, Di Zi No. 872, stated in the main text: "Li Guojie, in conspiracy, violated his duty with the intention of unlawfully harming the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, is sentenced to two years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for four years. Furthermore, for the crime of violating his authority as a public official and offering bribes, he is sentenced to two years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for three years. The combined sentence is three years of imprisonment and deprivation of public rights for four years. The number of days detained before the judgment is finalized will be used to offset the imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day. Chen Fumu's trial is suspended, and the 700,000 taels of silver in bribes are to be confiscated. If it has disappeared, it should be recovered." The appellant is dissatisfied with the entire judgment and has filed an appeal within the specified period. The reasons for dissatisfaction are detailed below:</p>
<p>Question of Responsibility: An Essential Element of Guilt. The appellant was the General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. At first glance, this title seems to imply full administrative power, but above the General Manager is the Supervisor, and above the Supervisor is the Ministry of Transportation. The General Manager is under the direction of the Supervisory Office and has no direct authority to the Ministry of Transportation. In short, the Supervisor is responsible to the Ministry of Transportation, and the General Manager is responsible to the Supervisor. All of this is specified in the regulations of the Supervisory Office and the organizational outline of the General Manager. The functions and powers are clearly defined. The original judgment held that the appellant was guilty of breach of trust and dereliction of duty for signing various contracts and delivering an advance of 700,000 taels. However, the contracts were not illegal, and the delivery of funds was not bribery (explained in detail in the next section). Even if the original judgment's distorted interpretation deemed it to be a breach of trust and dereliction of duty, it should only be applied to the Supervisor and not to the appellant. Why? The signing of the loan contracts and lease memorandums were all done under the Supervisor's orders. This was submitted to the court in the first instance. If the court did not believe it, it could have investigated using its authority (the original documents were deposited with the American merchant for verification, as stated in the court hearing). The advance of 700,000 taels was also handled under the Supervisor's verbal instructions. Although there was no formal order, reports indicated that Chen Fumu's telegram had already acknowledged the safekeeping of 700,000 taels, and the prosecutor's office verified that Chen Fumu had deposited the funds in various banks under different names. The original trial also recognized this as true. If it were not for the Supervisor's instructions, how could all the funds have been in his hands? This specific matter is clear and does not require further proof (see Article 295 of the Criminal Procedure Law). To convict someone as an accomplice for carrying out the orders of a superior official and fulfilling the duties of a subordinate official with loyalty is to undermine administrative authority. Articles 34 and 35 of the Criminal Law would be rendered meaningless. The appellant submitted various pieces of evidence in the original trial, and the defense attorney repeatedly stated them in court, but the judgment did not adopt any of them. Moreover, there was no explanation as to why they were not adopted or if there were any opposing pieces of evidence. This is the first reason for dissatisfaction. Secondly,</p>
<p>Establishment of the Loan: Process. After numerous studies and consultations, the appellant overcame numerous difficulties and eliminated hidden dangers. From a subjective standpoint, he believed that it was beneficial and harmless to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Now, moving away from subjectivity and observing it with objective intent, to revitalize the business of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, increase its capital, eliminate debt pressures, and avert the danger of bankruptcy, to needlessly borrow such a large sum and be subject to all kinds of restrictions would be foolish or insane. At this time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company was like more than twenty dilapidated ships, passengers and cargo were treated differently, debts amounted to 17 million, turnover had been desperate for a long time, shareholders were consulted and sighed, the government was appealed to, but only offered empty words of reorganization. The appellant, as both a representative of the shareholders and an official appointed by the government, bore a heavy responsibility and could not bear to see it decline. Fortunately, the Vice Minister of Transportation had previously approved, and Chen Fumu, as both the Vice Minister and Supervisor, had also approved. The American China Corporation had a long-standing relationship and showed sincerity. After more than ten written consultations and numerous oral negotiations, a final decision was reached. The original judgment lightly accused the appellant of unauthorized foreign debt. In this situation, could the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company maintain the only shipping industry in our country without borrowing debt? Domestic banks had not been in contact for a long time, so foreign debt had to be borrowed. The Supervisor approved it before it was implemented, so how can it be called unauthorized? This is the second reason for dissatisfaction. Furthermore,</p>
<p>Contents of Various Contracts: (1) Interest and Discount Issues. The original judgment cited the prosecution's claim that the actual amount received from the 20 million tael loan was reduced by more than 3.5 million, and determined that the harm was intentional. However, it did not understand that discounts and interest have an interactive effect. If the interest rate is set at nine percent, the discount is 85%. If the interest rate were 9.84 percent, the discount could be eliminated. If the authorities believed that receiving 85% was not cost-effective, then increasing the interest rate slightly would allow for receiving the full amount (the calculation formula was submitted as evidence in the original trial). Moreover, world finance is interconnected. The Shanghai Municipal Government received public bonds at 80% of the face value. Comparing this example, why is the merit and crime reversed? Since the change to state ownership, fragmented loans, short terms, and many clients have resulted in many restrictions. Recently, the water has dried up and the mountains have run out. Other than using foreign capital, there is no other way to survive. Read the initial letter from the American merchant (the translated version of the letter was submitted as evidence in the original trial). Its requested interest and discounts were already much lower than those specified in the contract. If the harm was intentional, why waste so much ink? (2) Right of First Refusal for Purchase and Sale. This provision is a common condition in both Chinese and foreign loans and was not created solely by the appellant. Its benefits and harms are entirely a matter of fact. Considering the full text of the contract, the repayment methods for both the 10 million tael construction contract and the same amount of the "盋頭合同" contract are detailed and complete. All rental income from newly built houses and leased docks, as well as half of the profits from the dock company's shares, are deposited into the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's account to repay the principal and interest. In total, there will be a surplus rather than a deficit in twenty years. Therefore, the sale of all or part of the assets and various subsidiary conditions that cannot be fulfilled upon maturity will never be realized. The right of first refusal will also never be executed. The original judgment regarded the conditions attached to the contract as a simple contract. It is not thoughtful. (3) Application of Law and Registration of Flag. Although any contract between compatriots does not have a legal application issue, there is still freedom to choose the law of the location and the law of the contract. Moreover, since one party is Chinese and the other is an American merchant, it is necessary to agree in advance. Therefore, there is no superiority or inferiority between using Chinese law and using American law. If it is said that the Chinese China Merchants Steam Navigation Company should not abandon domestic law and not use it, try to find that international private law stipulates that the application of domestic law is not sufficient, it is all foreign law. How can it explain itself? Registering in the United States and flying the American flag are all results of ownership not being transferred before the loan is repaid. Once it is paid off, it will naturally disappear.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Shanghai War Resulted in Factory Losses of Over 400 with 40 Million Yuan <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>| Social Affairs Bureau Scheduled to Announce Next Week |</p>
<p>According to the East China News Agency, after the Shanghai war, all privately-owned factories in the war zone were completely destroyed. The Ministry of Industry, in order to compile statistics, ordered the International Trade Bureau of this city to jointly investigate the losses of all privately-owned factories with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Accountants Association. After several months of work, all work has been completed. Currently, they are dividing and classifying statistics by industry. Yesterday, Mr. Tian Heqing, director of the factory investigation section of the Social Affairs Bureau, spoke in detail about the investigation process and current closing situation. It is recorded below.</p>
<p>Investigation Completed: According to Mr. Tian, after the end of the January 28th Incident last year, the bureau began investigating the losses of various privately-owned factories during the war. The investigation procedures were divided into three types: (1) direct losses, (2) indirect losses, (3) personnel losses. However, because the managers of the factories had not understood the meaning of the investigation in advance, or because there were no responsible persons to respond, the handling was very difficult. After several explanations and investigations, all work has now been completed.</p>
<p>Scheduled Announcement: Although this investigation has been completed, the bureau must classify each form by region, industry, and category in order to obtain a detailed report. Although this work can be completed in a short period of time, the bureau's daily work is very important, so it is not possible to devote oneself to this. Therefore, it must wait until next week before all can be completed and announced.</p>
<p>Slightly Approximate Loss: As for how much was lost in the disaster area this time, the previous reports were inaccurate. According to the results of the bureau's investigation, the total is about more than 400 factories. Among them, the Commercial Press suffered the greatest loss, about more than 10 million yuan. The second is the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company, together with other weaving mills and yarn mills, totaling about 40 million yuan. According to the scope of this investigation, it is surrounded Shanghai. The counties of Baoshan and Jiading are not included. If the statistics are combined with the counties, it may be more than 100 million yuan.</p>
<p>It is clear that no further elaboration is necessary. What urgently needs to be explained is whether the above conditions harm the bureau's production and hinder shipping. It was found that Guo Waifeng, a specialist last year, purchased two Norwegian ships, named Hai Xiang and Hai Rui. Before the price was cleared, the Norwegian flag was still flying. The conditions were written in the contract, which is the general practice in the world for buying and selling ships. Also not uniquely created by the appellant. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has failed in business for many years. The reason is solid, and repeated civil wars and fatigue from conscription are also a disease. If it is unfortunate that the unpaid ships will suffer setbacks again, what can be done? With the identification of the flag registry, it is possible to use the original ships as much as possible for government use, and the income from the new ships can be used to support the bureau. It maintains the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in an unequal position, and it also does its best to serve the government. If there is a war against foreign countries, it is enough to be a barrier to national navigation. It is not only the creditors who can protect their rights. The advantage or disadvantage of the appellant is this. The original judgment did not understand the painstaking effort and tried its best to find fault. This is the third reason for dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Secondly, the Delivery of 700,000 Taels in Advances. The appellant clearly stated in court that the business company expressed its credit, and the funds were kept by Chen Fumu. These are all true statements, but the original judgment arbitrarily determined that they were all embellishments. However, according to the loan contract, the company paid the funds after the bonds were issued. If it did not express its credit, why would the company prepay? Moreover, Chen Fumu actually deposited the 700,000 taels in banks. If Chen Fumu did not keep it himself, how could the funds be controlled by him alone? Based on the proof of this fact, there is no room for denial. If it is said to be an embellishment, what is the basis for it? The original judgment stated that the appellant's delivery was purely bribery in nature. Bribery has secret elements in addition to the normal items, and the result must be nothing. Now the company pays in the name of advance payments, and the appellant also accepts it in the name of advance payments (there is a receipt as evidence that has been submitted), and the time is 3:00 pm, the location is the office, open acceptance, justified, this is rare in ancient and modern China and foreign countries, if it is regarded as bribery, it is truly rare. If Chen Fumu accepts this money, whether it is properly kept, or there is embezzlement, it is a separate issue, and the cart can be put before the horse. As for what was provided in the interrogation court, such as the term petty fee, these are all the appellant's subsequent speculations about Chen Fumu's psychology. The records are simple, the words and meanings are different, and according to the above explanation, the bribery claim is not even established. According to the provisions of Article 280 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the facts are still the prerequisite, and the vague records cannot be used as a golden rule. The original judgment knew that it was not bribery, but it forcibly attached the nature to it. This is the fourth reason for dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the crime of breach of trust in Article 366 of the Criminal Law requires illegality. The appellant signed various contracts in accordance with the laws and regulations promulgated by the government. Even if there is actual damage, it does not fundamentally comply with the provisions of the article. If the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is a limited liability company and should obtain the consent of the shareholders' meeting, the rights of the shareholders of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company have long existed in name only, the Company Law has lost its effect, and the manager has no other way than to obey the laws and regulations of the administrative officers. In view of this, the original trial's citation of the crime of breach of trust was inappropriate, and the citation of the crime of dereliction of duty was absolutely based on the heart. The appellant also knows that the government's authority is actually enough to influence the general psychology, but the judiciary is independent, justice must be emphasized one day, urgently request your court to revoke the original judgment and declare innocent, it is really convenient. The document is respectfully submitted to the Jiangsu High Court.</p>

<p>Recently, the Yangtze River is very shallow, and the six company Yangtze River ships often have delays in schedules and grounding during the journey between Shanghai and Hankou. The Sanbei "Fengpu" ship has run aground twice in four days, and the hull may be damaged. The situation is recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Grounded in Dongliu River: The Yangtze River ship "Fengpu" of Sanbei Company, the last time in Shanghai to Hankou, brought the cargo and passengers from the "Fulong" ship unloaded from Nanjing upstream. It returned to Shanghai on the 22nd of this month. Passengers hoped to spend the New Year in Shanghai. On the 23rd, when it reached Dongliu, a place near Jiujiang, it ran aground due to the sharp decline in river water. The Hankou branch sent several tugboats to the accident site to remove the cargo. After three days, the ship was pulled out.</p>
<p>Encountered Danger at Taiziji: The ship was rescued from Dongliu and had already been delayed for many days. The shipowner set sail downstream. On the 29th at 9:00 pm, the "Fengpu" ran aground again in the shallow water of the Taiziji River near Anqing. It was late at night when the ship ran aground again on the shallow beach of Taiziji. The "Fengpu" ship was deeply mired in the mud, unable to move by itself. The shipowner used it to call for help again.</p>
<p>Qingpu Went to the Rescue: After "Fengpu" issued a second call for help, the "Qingpu" ship of the same bureau, which was parked in Nanjing, learned about it and immediately sailed to assist. When the ship arrived, it was already 11:00 pm at night, and it was difficult to distinguish, so it could not be dragged. Qingdao telegraphed to Shanghai to report, intending to wait for the tide to rise yesterday to rescue. It is generally expected to be pulled out. However, "Fengpu" has been stranded twice, and the bottom of the wheel may be damaged. It is now planned to return to Shanghai for inspection and repair, but the flight has been delayed for six days.</p>

According to Mr. Guo Weibai of the International Trade Bureau, the exhibits from various provinces and cities have been arriving in Shanghai one after another, but several provinces have not yet been shipped. It has now been telegraphed to urge them to ship as soon as possible. As for the shipment of exhibits to Shanghai, the Ministry of Industry has ordered that all taxes be exempted.

This plan had been approved by the Central Political Council, hence the convening of today’s general assembly of representatives of Jiangsu and Zhejiang fishery groups to establish the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Fisheries Improvement Committee. A total of twelve fishery groups, totaling thirty-one people, registered from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions, and twenty-four people were present today, exceeding the legal quorum, so an election could proceed.

<p>Letter Sent to Shanghai-Minhang Company</p>
<p>To Plant Trees Along the Road</p>
<p>The Shanghai County Agricultural Education Hall, in view of the unsightly appearance of the countryside within its jurisdiction and the urgent need for improvement, and noting the unevenness of the trees along the Shanghai-Minhang Motor Road, which detracts from the view, yesterday (30th) sent a letter to the Transportation Company and the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Long-Distance Bus Company, requesting them to replant trees. The letter stated: "Planting trees along roads serves to embellish the scenery, enhance human aesthetics, provide shade from the sun, and reduce water evaporation. Therefore, road builders must plant trees, and uniformity in tree planting is especially valuable. In the western suburbs of Shanghai, forests have already provided shade, and the trees along the roads to Nantong are also quite magnificent. The beautiful appearance of the countryside truly enhances the spirit of the region. We have observed that the roadside trees along the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Motor Road leased by your company are uneven, which detracts from the view. This road, having been connected to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway and the Songhu Highway, has become a major transportation artery. If the scenery along the way is beautiful, it will be even more attractive, which is related to the future business prospects of your company. Your company should take timely action to replant trees and regularly maintain them, so that they can grow into a forest and create a model road in the suburbs. Thereafter, your company's business will flourish day by day, and you will not begrudge this small effort. We are sending this letter in the hopes that you will investigate and provide a reply."</p>

<p>Letter Responds to National Salvation Association Regarding the Situation of Various Armies</p>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that the Shanghai Associations National Salvation United Association previously sent a letter to the Northeastern Volunteer Army Rear Support Association, requesting prompt fundraising to purchase bedding and clothing to supply the front-line soldiers fighting bloody battles in the Yuguan Danfu area. The association has now received a letter from the Rear Support Association, stating: "We acknowledge receipt of your letter of January 21st. The points raised are indeed important. However, the cash and materials raised by this association to support the Northeastern Volunteer Army have been continuously provided to various units, leaving little in storage. The recent invasion of Yuguan by the violent Japanese, and the tenacious resistance of the defending troops, while resulting in defeat, has boosted morale. It has been decided to allocate 10,000 yuan to慰勞the front-line soldiers, which has been remitted to the Tianjin Local Association for dispatch to Commander He Zhuguo. Recently, the Ningbo Current Affairs Gazette remitted 6,000 yuan in donations, specifically designated for the military expenditure of He Zhuguo's troops, which will also be remitted to encourage them. However, the provisions and clothing for the troops within the Pass are funded, which is vastly different from the Jihei Volunteer Army, who lack clothing and food. It is the duty of this association to consider the urgency and provide full support. Currently, for the Jilin Feng Zhanhai, Heilongjiang Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, Tai Binshan, and Tan Zixin units, who have retreated to the Jin River, in addition to providing ammunition, over 5,000 pieces of donated cotton clothing, military blankets, tents, bedding, etc., have been allocated to each unit for their use and are already being transported. The number of donations is small, and the Jin River is in a critical situation, with 200,000 volunteer soldiers awaiting support. We are unable to fulfill your request for the time being. We are sending this letter in the hopes that you will investigate."</p>

<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a document to the Municipal Government yesterday, urging them to correct the excessive dock dues as soon as possible. The original text stated: "Regarding the excessive rate of dock dues in this city, we are submitting this document to urge you to correct it as soon as possible to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. On the 25th of this month, the Shanghai Cotton Trade Association wrote to us, stating that regarding the dock dues case, our association had previously written to your association to appeal to the government. However, as no relief has been seen from the government, we have repeatedly sent letters urging you to take action. We are extremely concerned about this matter and are eagerly awaiting relief, so we are sending this follow-up letter to beg you to alleviate our distress and promptly urge action to maintain our precarious business. We are very grateful." According to this, we found that on December 2nd of last year, the association stated the previous situation in a letter, and we submitted it to your government as Document No. 139 to request that the Customs be asked to correct the increased dues in accordance with the collection agreement. Subsequently, on the 27th of the same month, we submitted a follow-up letter as Document No. 155 to urge action. According to the previous situation, the excessively high dock dues are causing severe pain to the sugar industry, and they are urgently requesting relief. They have repeatedly asked for reductions, and their situation is dire. We are submitting this follow-up letter to beg your government to investigate and ask Jianghai Customs to promptly reduce the dock dues in accordance with the agreement to alleviate the difficulties of merchants for the public good.</p>

<p>According to Guomin News Agency, Yuan, a native of Jinan, Shandong, aged thirty-nine, who formerly worked as a translator for the Japanese-Chinese Cotton Mill, took the opportunity during the January 28th incident last year, when Japanese troops invaded Shanghai, to gather bandits and set fires, looting, and disrupting the rear in Zhabei. After the war subsided, Yuan feared punishment and fled, remaining at large. The Military Affairs Commission secretly ordered the Songhu Garrison Headquarters to order the Shanghai Public Security Bureau Chief Wen Hongen to have Detective Captain Lu Ying strictly arrest and prosecute Yuan. After receiving the order, Captain Lu ordered detectives Ni Shoutian, Chen Liangfu, Rong Bingchen, Wu Tianxiang, and Sun Shucheng, disguised as civilians, to rush to the Sixth District General Office in Caoyang Road, West Shanghai, and together with District Chief Tan Baoshou, dispatched additional police officers to secretly arrest Yuan at house number three in Hefeng Lane on Bailinan Road at 1:00 PM on the 29th.

<p>- Photograph Affixed to Business Card -</p>
<p>At around 5:00 AM yesterday, Lin Xingli, a Ningbo native who was responsible for cleaning the alley at Fuyuan Lane, Kangding Road, in West Shanghai, discovered a middle-aged man, about thirty years old, sitting stiffly in front of No. 6, Third Lane. Blood was continuously flowing from his mouth and nose. He was wearing a short wool overcoat, padded jacket and trousers underneath, and velvet shoes. The person in charge of the alley, upon seeing this, remembered that No. 6 had been uninhabited for a long time, realized something was wrong, and rushed out of the alley to report to the nearby patrolmen. They also reported to the Gordon Road Police Station, which dispatched a large number of detectives to the scene. After examining the body, they found a wallet, several business cards with different names, and two passports. One of them was filled in with the name Shao Yuangen and stated that he was a detective in the Taicang County Public Security Bureau. A photograph of the deceased was affixed to the upper corner. After reading the documents, the detectives immediately transported the body to the morgue for examination and took the items to the police station for investigation.

<p>Smashing Teacups On the 25th of this month, at around 11:00 AM, a woman went alone to the Da Wan Hotel at No. 20, Mingguo Road, in the French Concession and checked into a room. She was reported to be Yang Dongying, 40 years old, from Ningbo. She was led to Room 18 upstairs by a tea server. Shortly after, the woman had a mental breakdown, cursed incessantly, and smashed several teacups on the floor. The tea server tried to stop her in vain and reported to the Xiaodongmen Police Station, which sent officers to arrest the woman. The officers questioned her about her residence, but she gave irrelevant answers and spoke incoherently. They were instructed to detain her temporarily until relatives could claim her. By the 28th, no family members had been found. The police chief ordered her to be sent to the Xinpu Yutang Mental Asylum in Nanshi for care and treatment. The woman had short hair, combed back, and was wearing a dark blue satin cotton-padded jacket and trousers, with a fake wool vest and black socks and gray velvet shoes. If any relatives are found, they can contact the French Concession General Police Station or Xinpu Yutang to claim her.</p>
<p>Tearing Up Banknotes Wu Hougui, a Ningbo native, 44 years old, used to be a boatman. He lived at No. 5, Huaixianfang, Fujia Street, in the city. In the spring of last year, Wu suffered a major shock, which led to mental illness. He cried and laughed unpredictably every day. Sometimes he danced and sang loudly at home, or he frowned and sat silently in a corner. He often secretly tore banknotes into small pieces and threw them into the sky, making them fly like butterflies. Then he laughed wildly at the sky. Sometimes he rubbed silver dollars on the ground until they were half-worn, treating money as waste. Yesterday morning, at around 10:00 AM, Wu started an argument with his wife, Yang, for no reason and beat her severely. Zhou Songyang, the local patrol officer, heard the commotion and came to separate them. When he asked for the reason, Wu, without any consideration, grabbed Zhou's left hand and bit his index finger hard, causing it to bleed. The officer took Wu to the First District, Second Precinct Police Station. During the preliminary interrogation by the station chief, Wu Hougui's answers were also irrelevant. Since he was considered insane, his actions were excusable, and he was handed back to his wife, Yang, to be sent to the hospital for proper treatment.</p>

Recognizing the abundance of foreign goods in the city and the lack of a large-scale national goods company, they united well-known national goods manufacturers to provide high-quality, pure national goods for compatriots to choose from. It offers a wide range of daily necessities, divided into more than twenty departments, and is rightly called a national goods store. It is said that the store will open in the near future.</p>

<p>The Yellow River is in crisis again. Every Chinese citizen has a responsibility to save the nation. To save the nation, we must first help the Northeast Volunteer Army, who are resisting the enemy's planes and cannons in the freezing cold. Artists are representatives of the nation's culture and also have a responsibility for "saving the nation through art." Our association is now soliciting art works for the second time. We hope that artists and talented women both at home and abroad will donate the crystallization of their life's efforts, whether it be calligraphy, painting, sculpture, photography, embroidery, Western painting, or other handicrafts. If art collectors both at home and abroad could part with their cherished antiques, calligraphy, and paintings to enthusiastically participate in the unprecedented national art exhibition that will officially open at the Chen Yingshi Memorial Hall on Guizhou Road, Shanghai, on February 12, we would be even more grateful!</p>

The manager is named Chen Taisheng. The factory had stopped work on December 23rd of the lunar calendar and only started work yesterday. Therefore, the workers entered the factory one after another at around 7:00 AM. The workers in charge of the machinery and bleaching immediately started the machines. Unexpectedly, after only a few rotations, sparks erupted from the engine and landed on the bleached cotton, immediately igniting it.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Water Freezes, Fire Spreads <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>According to the factory workers, sparks often erupted from the engine when they put the bleached cotton into the machine. The cotton would catch fire immediately because bleaching requires the use of sulfur, which is easily flammable. Therefore, the factory had installed water pipes next to each machine. In the event of a fire, the water could be used to extinguish it. However, when the fire broke out yesterday, the inside of the water pipes had frozen, and no water came out. Therefore, within a few minutes, the fire spread to the entire machine room. All the workers gathered in the room, and seeing that the fire was uncontrollable, they climbed onto the roof and shouted for help. At the same time, the factory and nearby factories telegraphed the fire brigades to report the alarm.</p>

<p>The Zhabei fire brigades arrived first and saw that the fire was spreading rapidly and that the workers were still on the roof, in imminent danger. They quickly used ladders to rescue the workers first. At the same time, the Central and Xinzha fire brigades of the Public Concession also heard the news and drove to the scene to help extinguish the fire. In total, more than forty water pipes were aimed at the factory to spray water. However, due to the cold weather, the supply of tap water was scarce and almost insufficient. At the same time, the factory walls were high, making it difficult to extinguish the fire. The firefighters burned wood next to the water pipes to melt the ice in the pipes and raised ladders to spray water from above. Soon, the fireboat of the Water Police Station also arrived and began to pump water from the Suzhou River to supply the fire engines. The water pressure of the fire engines increased, and the fire was slightly reduced. It was not completely extinguished until around 11:00 AM at noon. The entire factory was destroyed.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Losses Estimated at Over 100,000 <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>After the fire was extinguished, an investigation was conducted into the losses of the factory. It is understood that there were nine cotton ginning machines in the factory, each worth more than 4,000 yuan. There was also a motor, worth about 40,000 yuan, and a pile of cotton silk waste, worth about 30,000 yuan. The total loss was estimated at over 100,000 yuan. A large amount of gasoline was stored inside the factory, but fortunately, it was rescued by the firefighters before it was burned, otherwise the consequences would have been even more unimaginable. At the same time, the Yikang Warehouse on the left side of the factory and the warehouse of the China Merchants' Gauze Exchange on the right side were not affected, which can be said to be a great stroke of luck. It is also understood that the factory only had 40,000 yuan of fire insurance.</p>

<p>~ Transporting Two Million Stones of Rice to Shanghai ~</p>
<p>~ Loading to Begin on February 1 ~</p>
<p>Last year's autumn harvest in Hunan was very abundant, and there was a large stock of rice in various places. At that time, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Hunan Provincial Government agreed to transport two million stones of Hunan rice to Shanghai for sale. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company also assigned the Jiangda and Jiangjing ships to transport the rice to Changsha. Unexpectedly, the Hunan Provincial authorities required the payment of export passport fees and other taxes for each stone, resulting in excessive costs. At that time, only 700 bags were transported to Shanghai before loading was stopped, and Hunan rice has not been able to leave the province since. Until the beginning of this month, the Hunan Construction Department learned that Jiangxi and Anhui provinces were exempting rice taxes and exporting rice in large quantities. Two special commissioners were sent, one to Shanghai and one to Guangzhou, to negotiate transportation and sales matters. Wang Qunhui, the representative in Shanghai, negotiated with various local steamship companies on ways to reduce freight rates, temporarily using silver as foreign currency to collect freight. The Hunan government also agreed to waive taxes. Taking advantage of the high rice prices in Shanghai, they plan to load two million stones of rice to Shanghai. Various Chinese shipping companies have expressed their sympathy and have agreed to send ships to Hunan to start loading on February 1. Foreign river steamers, upon hearing the news, have also dispatched ships to Changsha to compete to transport rice to Shanghai. It is reported that the first batch of Hunan rice may arrive here this week.</p>

<p>The number of citizens traveling back and forth between the east and west banks of the Huangpu River is estimated to be over 150,000 per month, according to statistics from three years ago. However, the privately-run ferries are poorly equipped, and crossing the river takes at least fifteen minutes and up to twenty minutes to half an hour. Moreover, the ships are old and often cause accidents, which is not uncommon. In order to develop the Pudong area and facilitate public transportation, the municipal government ordered the Public Works Department to establish cross-river ferries at key locations. Since its opening, the citizens have found it convenient. Taking the Dongmen Road-Lujiazui line as an example, nearly 10,000 people travel back and forth each month. Now, further improvements have been sought, and two new-style ferries that travel in both directions have been ordered and completed. On the 25th of this month, the municipal government appointed Secretary Zhang Tingrong, together with Tan Boying, the chief of the Ferry General Management Office of the Public Works Department, to inspect and accept the ferries. The ferries are 63 feet long, 15 feet wide, with a draft of 4.5 feet, 75 horsepower, and an average speed of 8 knots. They can carry two large cars. Because the ferries travel</p>

<p>Family Members of Crew Extremely Anxious</p>
<p>Various Parties Speculate Ill Omens Are Likely</p>
<p>|| Manager Helplessly Travels to Qingpu to Seek Divine Intervention ||</p>
<p>The Yu Long ship, belonging to the Tongyu Shipping Company, which disappeared on December 8 last year after loading coal in Hongji and sailing to Shanghai, has been gone for two months. After customs offices in various locations sent telegrams to inquire, there is still no news. Various parties predict that it may have sunk. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>No News The Yu Long ship loaded 2,400 tons of coal in Hongji on December 8 and sailed to Shanghai, suddenly disappearing. After the company telegraphed the Hong Kong radio station to relay the call without a response, the Ying Ping Feng Xiang ships of Hong Kong Yanzhou Island passed by on the 3rd of this month and discovered the Yu Long's bizarre radio signal. The company then telegraphed customs offices in Hongji, Hainan, Hong Kong, Shantou, and other places to investigate on their behalf. Now, the customs offices in various places have replied that telegrams have been sent to inquire, but there is still no news.</p>
<p>Ill Omens Are Likely The entire crew of the Yu Long ship consisted of about 40 people. After the families of the crew received the news of the ship's disappearance, they all went to the company to inquire about the truth and request relief. Manager Chen Yisheng first issued one month's salary to the families of the crew to comfort them. Now, the families have not received any news to date. According to various predictions, ill omens are likely. They have been going to the company to inquire for days. The reporter met with the families of the crew yesterday, and they all wept bitterly when they talked about the ship's disappearance. Their situation was very tragic.</p>
<p>Various Predictions The reporter from Xinsheng News Agency spoke with the company's accountant, who said that the disappearance of the Yu Long ship was a rare occurrence in the shipping industry. The company sent telegrams to various places to investigate, but there was no news. On December 8, three ships from the Sanbei Company, the Taishan ship, the French ship, and a Japanese ship, set sail at the same time from Hongji, but none of them saw the Yu Long ship's trail. It is predicted that it was either robbed or sunk in a hurricane. It is said that the manager has already gone to Qingpu to seek divine intervention. However, according to the reporter's inquiry in the shipping industry, the ship has not been found to date. It is believed that it encountered a hurricane and crashed after sailing from Hongji and before passing Hainan Island.</p>
<p>Sailing, eliminating the trouble of turning around. Therefore, the ferry can cross the river once in just two minutes. The sailing is not only not shallow, but also stable, fast, and comfortable, which is an innovation in our country. It is reported that the Public Works Department is planning to build a wharf on the opposite bank of the river and another ferry in order to prepare for the convenience of crossing the river. The pace will be accelerated, and after it is launched in the future, the convenience of traffic on both sides of the river will be no different from sailing.</p>

<p>— Regarding the Issue of Amending the Yangjingbang Regulations —</p>
<p>— The Municipal Government Yesterday Consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for Approval —</p>
<p>The case of the Shanghai Public Concession Taxpayer Association requesting the addition of two Chinese land committee members has been negotiated several times and a conclusion has been reached. However, the amendment of the Yangjingbang Regulations still needs to be submitted to the National Government for approval and confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in consultation with representatives of relevant countries before being submitted for review and implementation. Therefore, the association sent a letter to the municipal government yesterday requesting it to carry out the procedures. The municipal government also consulted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday for review and approval. The consultation is as follows: This is a matter for consultation. According to the Shanghai Concession Taxpayer Association's letter, it is stated that in the case of adding two Chinese committee members to the Shanghai Public Concession Board of Directors' land committee, the two newly added Chinese committee members must be appointed by the Taxpayer Association. Those appointed must not be owners or representatives of owners. The other person is to be appointed by the Chinese Owners Association (the association, together with the original Western committee members, will total five people). It also states that the Taxpayer Association and the Owners Association must exchange opinions with the Chinese Directors of the Board of Directors when selecting Chinese committee members. All parties have now agreed. However, with regard to the amendment of the Yangjingbang Regulations, it should be submitted to the National Government for approval, following the precedent of the Board of Directors joining and adding Chinese Directors, and confirmed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in consultation with representatives of relevant countries before being submitted for review and implementation. Based on this, it was previously approved that the US Consul General in Shanghai and Concession Leader Consul Kenningham has sent letters successively, stating that the Board of Directors has agreed to the Taxpayer Association's wishes regarding the selection of Chinese committee members, and hoping that your Mayor will provide written confirmation of agreement to the Board of Directors' proposed amendment (Clause 9A of the Yangjingbang Regulations must be amended, following Article 28 of the Yangjingbang Regulations). If it is necessary to amend the Yangjingbang Regulations, the right to submit opinions to the Diplomatic Corps is granted. This has been forwarded to the Taxpayer Association for review and reply. Based on the previous situation, it is appropriate to consult your Ministry for review and approval.</p>

<p>Scheme to Slander Devised in Discord with a Friend</p>
<p>Reporting the Sale of Opium Leads to Exposure and Arrest</p>
<p>| Sentenced After Clear Testimony |</p>
<p>Zhang Cimin, a local resident, became acquainted with Hua Gen (transliteration), a Chinese detective at the Xisandoutou station of the British Naval Volunteers, last year while working at the British Naval Volunteers Association. They became close friends. Zhou Fuchu had a dispute with Wang Youzhang, who resided at No. 90, Lane 17, Longmen Road. Zhou harbored resentment and sought to slander Wang, knowing that Wang possessed opium paste and related paraphernalia. Zhou secretly conspired with his friend Wu Xixian. Wu, being friends with Zhang Cimin, enlisted Zhang's help. On the 26th of this month, Zhang telephoned Hua Gen, claiming that Wang Youzhang was secretly trafficking opium from Fuzhou, Hankou, Shantou, and other places to Shanghai for clandestine sale. He claimed Wang was currently selling opium at his residence and urged Hua Gen to assist in a search and seizure, adding that Wang had two thousand dollars in cash in his drawer and that a profitable deal could be made if Wang, fearing arrest, sought release. Hua Gen, a detective from the Xisandoutou station, suspected Zhang was not a good person upon receiving the call. He feigned agreement while secretly reporting to Chief Detective MacDonald. He then contacted Zhang and arranged a meeting at Room 351 of the Dongfang Hotel at 9 PM on the 27th to proceed together. Hua Gen went to the Dongfang Hotel alone and found Zhang Cimin, Xie Jifang, Zhou Fuchu, Wu Xixian, and four others gambling. After introductions, Zhang, Xie, and Zhou accompanied Hua Gen to Longmen Road. Zhang knocked on Wang's door and entered to conduct a search. Unbeknownst to them, the police had already devised a clever plan to trap them. The Chief Detective had telegraphed Detective Hunter of the Xinzha Police Station, instructing detectives Tang Jian and Huierkekaosi to lie in wait at Wang's residence. Upon the arrival of Zhang and his companions, they were immediately arrested. A complete set of opium paraphernalia and a jar of opium were found under Wang's bed and taken to the police station. After questioning, it was revealed that Wu Xixian had instigated the incident. The Chinese and Western detectives then went to Room 351 of the Dongfang Hotel and apprehended Wu, along with suspected accomplices Jiang Liugen, Yang Honggen, Xu Shiying, Xu Yongli, Shen Jichang, Wu Binglin, and a total of ten others. They were taken to the police station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were all brought before the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Wang Yaotang, the police lawyer, began by detailing the above circumstances, stating that the police were prosecuting the four defendants, Zhang, Xie, Zhou, and Wu, under Article 370 of the Criminal Law for extortion and fraud. The remaining five defendants, Yang, Xu, Ji, Shen, and Wu, were found to have no connection and should be released. However, Jiang Liugen was suspected of conspiracy with Zhang and the others because he had booked the room at the Dongfang Hotel and should be interrogated. The defendants jointly retained two lawyers, Fan Gang and Du Jimei, to defend them. Hua Gen, the Chinese detective from the Xisandoutou station, then testified to everything. Wang Youzhang also claimed that he only knew Zhou Fuchu among the defendants because he had previously recommended business to him. Zhou had visited his home twice, at 10 AM and 7 PM that day, to inquire. He came again at 9 PM, but Wang was out, so he was unaware. However, the opium paraphernalia that was found belonged to his sister, who had set them up because she was sick. She had passed away on December 19th, and the paraphernalia had been left under the bed. When questioned, Zhang Cimin claimed that Hua Gen had asked him to report any leads on the private sale of opium. He had only reported that Wang Youzhang's family was selling opium and had no intention of extortion. Xie, Zhou, and Wu gave evasive testimonies. The others denied the accusations. After mutual arguments from both parties’ lawyers, Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the evidence and sentenced Zhang, Xie, and Zhou to three months imprisonment each. Wu Xixian was sentenced to five months imprisonment. The other six defendants, including Jiang Liugen, were found not guilty and released. It is said that Zhang and the others expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and will appeal. The opium paraphernalia was confiscated.</p>

<p>| Still Negotiating with the Concessions |</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government had planned to implement an entertainment tax for disaster relief early on, but the implementation was delayed because the tax collection methods had not yet been finalized. The Municipal Bureau of Finance recently drafted the methods, which were submitted to the Municipal Government and have now been approved. According to reliable sources, the entertainment tax in the Chinese-controlled areas will be implemented by the various tax collection offices of the Bureau of Finance starting February 1st. As for the French Concession and the International Settlement, negotiations are still underway, but it is expected that they will also be implemented soon. In the future, the tax will likely be levied simultaneously in the concessions. The collection methods are listed below: 1. All cinemas and entertainment venues shall, in accordance with central government orders, collect a disaster relief donation of 10% on their ticket or seat prices. Unless otherwise specified by the central government, these methods shall apply. 2. To avoid practical difficulties and facilitate the procedures for the collection venues, receipts will not be issued. 3. The aforementioned disaster relief donation shall be collected and reported by the cinemas, theaters, and entertainment venues and a disaster relief tax paid stamp shall be affixed to the tickets (if only seat prices are charged and no tickets are issued, the donation shall be calculated based on the actual seat price). 4. The disaster relief donations collected by the cinemas, theaters, and entertainment venues shall be settled daily and reported on a weekly basis, along with the donation funds, to the various tax collection offices of the Bureau for verification and collection. The weekly report form will be determined separately. 5. The various tax collection offices shall submit the aforementioned donation funds to the Bureau on the same day for forwarding to the Central Bank for disbursement. 6. The various tax collection offices shall compile a summary table of the weekly donations from the cinemas, theaters, and entertainment venues and submit it to the Bureau for review. 7. If the number of donations reported by cinemas, theaters, and entertainment venues does not match their business income, the main ledgers of the venues may be inspected. If concealment or underpayment is discovered, it shall be reported and dealt with according to law. 8. These methods may be revised at any time if there are any omissions. 9. These methods shall be implemented after being approved by the Municipal Government.</p>

<p>| Letter from Wang Chuhou</p>
<p>I studied at a higher primary school for three years and have always been keen to study science carefully. A female classmate and I were in agreement with each other, and we became engaged. I intended to go to middle school after graduation to complete my studies, and then officially marry her. Unexpectedly, after graduating last year, my father called me to go out and be an apprentice. Before I went into the shop, I always thought I could learn something while working, but the day after entering the shop, the boss actually announced my servant work! Up to now, I am still busy with servant work. Needless to say, I am falling behind in my studies day by day! As for marriage, it is related to lifelong happiness, but parents only need to complete the marriage for their children to fulfill their parents' responsibility. So my father has arranged a village woman for me, who does not know a single word, and only knows how to cook and wash clothes every day! Now I have no joy in life, may I ask how to solve it?</p>
<p>Answer: I have read your letter. Your problem is not a big deal. Since you and a female classmate are in agreement with each other and have an engagement, then you should keep it and not change it. As for the village woman your parents have arranged for you, you should write a letter to them explaining that marriage must be independent, and resolutely reject their "meddling." This is one. However, there is one thing. You think your female classmate is naturally much better than "a village woman who does not know a single word, and only knows how to cook and wash clothes," but this also depends on how you see it. In our experience, the so-called female students in the city certainly know how to read, and even write letters, and say a few nice words like "equality" and "freedom." However, apart from these abilities, all they have left is to run around in the "modern" dress of modern girls all day long. Although they are dressed up in a flamboyant and ethereal manner, or if not, they want to go to the cinema here today and go dancing there tomorrow. Today they see someone else's coat is good, and they want you to buy it, and tomorrow they see someone else's leather bag is good, and they want you to get it. Then you will be overwhelmed and exhausted. If you don't agree, then she will gradually reduce her love, and if someone richer than you can meet her needs, then she will "switch to another lute." As a result, you may only end up with nothing, and it is better than "the village woman who cooks and washes clothes." We are just talking about general experience, for your reference, of course your female friend is not such a woman, so we cannot generalize. This is two. Since you are keen to study science carefully, you must steal time from your busy schedule to study. As long as you don't let go every day, and don't let go at any time, there will always be opportunities for you to study, even if it is a very short time, such as an hour, or even three or two minutes. Ask the boss in the name of your colleagues to give you this little time to read newspapers. I think it can be done. This is three.</p>

<h3 id="e155">Educational Progress in Fujian Province <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>〓Restoring the Original Education Budget of 120,000〓</p>
<p>〓Universities Coordinate and Collaborate〓</p>
<p>The original education budget for Fujian Province was 120,000, which was allocated from salt tax revenue and had been in place for a long time. Due to various reasons last year, only 100,000 was paid. Although various economizing measures were taken, the actual amount needed was still more than 109,000, with the difference to be covered by the provincial treasury. However, the situation this year is completely different. The counties in southern Fujian have fallen into the red disaster, and local education has gone bankrupt. Although the 19th Route Army has gradually recovered them, the subsequent construction of school buildings, training of teachers, and replenishment of equipment all require funds. Other primary and secondary schools in various counties are also facing difficulties due to the impact of the local economic downturn and have requested subsidies. Furthermore, many planned projects are waiting for funds to proceed. It is heard that the new Director of Education, Zheng Zhenwen, immediately proposed to the provincial government to strive to restore the original budget of 120,000 to cope with the situation and request the Auditing Office to allocate the funds accordingly. However, Liu Shumei, the manager of the Auditing Office, is still delaying.</p>
<p>Also, Fujian Director of Education Zheng Zhenwen is striving to rectify school education and has been visiting various schools under his jurisdiction for inspection and guidance for several days, sparing no effort. Recently, in order to seek cooperation among the province's private universities, he specially convened a discussion meeting at the Department on the afternoon of the 13th of this month, inviting Xiamen University President Lin Wenqing, Secretary Zhan Rujia, Fujian College President He Gonggan, Dean of Academics Ruan Xiang, Secretary Guo Mengsong, Union College President Lin Jingrun, Dean of Academics Chen Xi'en, and Department Secretary Wei Xianzhang, Section Chief Tang Shouqian, Inspector Wen Yunong, and Chen Kezhong, an inspector dispatched by the Ministry, to attend. After mutual discussion among the college presidents, it was decided to connect the current universities so that they can become a comprehensive university in the near future, cooperating with each other, assisting each other, and avoiding duplication of departments and systems while developing their unique spirits so that they can each become a complete university in the future. For example, Fujian College has recently added a library where many ancient books are stored by various parties, which is enough to provide for the application of Union College's liberal arts. Union College's original natural science equipment is enough to assist Fujian College in planning for the establishment of an agricultural science department. Xiamen University focuses on the study of aquatic organisms, while Union College focuses on the study of terrestrial organisms. As for medical science, engineering science, and mining science, which are essential but not available in the three schools, it was decided that Union and Xiamen would expedite the planning of all specific methods, which will be discussed at the next meeting, the second session of which is scheduled to be held during the spring break. It was also decided that the Department of Education will publish a special issue on higher education in February, classifying and publishing the past management and future plans of each university to serve as a basis for the next meeting.</p>

<p>At Least One to be Established</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Department of Education issued an order to each county in May regarding the establishment of township primary schools, requiring each county to complete the establishment of township primary schools within twenty-one years. After examining the reports from each county, it was found that many had complied with the order, but some had not yet complied due to special local circumstances or the inability to raise funds. Now that the second semester of this year has begun, the establishment of township primary schools in each county can be prepared and established, and the deadline is extended to the end of the twenty-first year for complete establishment. The provincial party headquarters has sent a letter requesting that the provincial government issue an order to all county governments to achieve the establishment of at least one primary school in each township within a time limit, which was submitted by the fifth provincial representative conference of the province. Yesterday, a separate order was issued to each county government to comply with the order and report.</p>

<p>The Guoxiang Women's Vocational School, founded by Ms. Yang Huaxun Yang, had previously leased No. 3, Lane 177, Luban Road as its school address and had advertised for enrollment on the 20th of this month.

Therefore, it has leased a foreign house at No. 486, Intersection of Saposai Road and Poba Road, French Concession, as the school address. The school will be relocated soon. The place is spacious, the classrooms are wide and bright, and the practice and sports are convenient. It can accommodate 300 students.

<h3 id="e184">Yesterday's Football Friendly Match: Agaar Defeats Youyou <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Result: 7-1</p>
<p>Liu Mao, Li Youshi, and Shi Will Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Because the Youyou football team has not had a match for two weeks, they are deeply concerned that their skills will become rusty. Therefore, they specially invited the British Army Agaar team for a friendly match at the Zhonghua Baseball Field yesterday to practice. There were about 2,000 spectators. Youyou's Huang Ruihua was unable to attend due to illness, and goalkeeper Liang Guanlian was also absent, so Wang Caigao took his place. The midfield line was quite weak, and the forwards were led by Sun Tiejiao, but there was no coordination, and he could not support himself. In addition, Agaar is the only strong team in Shanghai, so Youyou was inferior in comparison. Except for a penalty kick scored by Sun Jinshun in the first half, there were no other achievements. Agaar, on the other hand, galloped horizontally and vertically, and was extremely brave, scoring a total of seven goals. As a result, Youyou lost 1-7. The lineups are as follows:</p>
<p>Agaar</p>
<p>Heng Tou, Tao Houdan, Haisti, Bailandon, Yumen, Ge Lanhan, Mike Wei, Haimengtuo, Kelange, Maikedawi, Weili</p>
<p>Youyou</p>
<p>Wang Caigao, Wang Shusen, Qian Yaoyao, Wang Zhangbao, Mao Honggui, Ye Jinmian, Shi Jinsheng, Sun Huipei, Cheng Yize (Second Half), Hu Youcheng (First Half), Sun Yongshun, Xi Qiaosheng, Shen Baigui</p>
<p>According to reliable sources, Liu Mao, the vice-captain of the Hong Kong Inter-Port team, and Li Youshi, a famous player from the Chongzheng Association, will arrive in Shanghai on January 3rd to join Youyou. Then, in the future, Youyou's lineup will definitely be refreshing and advocate for the Chinese football scene in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Wavering Around Ten Taels from High to Low</p>
<p>Only Three Taels Better Than Before the Border Closure</p>
<h3 id="e186">Bird's-Eye View of the Whole City <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>During the Spring Festival holiday, there was a sudden drop in overseas silver markets. In four days, the London large bars rose a total of 25, the New York silver price rose a total of 625, the British-American exchange rate rose 675, and the US dollar exchange rate fell by more than one cent. It should have opened sharply higher, but the bank's private telegram only fell by half a cent, giving the gold market a small blow. The morning opening was 793 taels. The market once flourished, reaching 794.5 taels. However, the bank's appetite was not good. The exchange market opened with a near-term British exchange rate of 1 shilling and 8 pence. The US dollar was 28.25 yuan. Although it was tighter than before the border closure, it was not much compared to the decline in the silver market. Although people's hearts did not show a trend of weakening, the exchange market gradually hardened, and it turned downward. First, Huabi sold March US dollars at 3125 and could no longer rise. Later, Huabi sold May half-yuan again. Citibank also stuffed out March, already 375, heading downward. HSBC listed British shrinking 125 and American falling 25. At this time, the gold price had dropped by a little more than four taels, so it didn't matter much. After entering, because the gold was 625 in May, the banks were willing to sell it, and it broke 90 taels. Furthermore, because the May US dollar 6875 was also unattended, it fell to 88 taels and two cents. The noon closing was 788 taels and eight cents. Although the Central Bank had opened spot trading several times, it was only a little more than two taels in return. The exchange market was looser in the afternoon, and the gold price was even more unable to support it. May transactions were at 875. The bank tended to sell, and it dropped to 84 taels and three cents. Later, it gradually leveled off. The gold market was even more inflated due to the double closing price relationship, so it closed at 786 taels. The situation went from high to low in one day. The market situation was bleak. The trading among peers was mediocre. The Central Bank opened a total of about 420 bars in this city, with prices ranging from 90 taels to 90 taels and 05 cents, which were done on behalf of Dadexing, Qianchangxiang, Tongfenghheng and other spot trading houses. The swap was extremely quiet. No transaction was heard. The premium was generally still around one tael. Now I will record the market situation during the day,</p>
<h3 id="e187">First Trade Jumps Ten Taels <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>The morning opening rose by ten taels compared to before the border closure, at 793 taels. People's hearts were still stable. First, I saw two taels and five cents, which was a sale of goods (the goods opened at 792.5 taels). Fuyu and others initially entered at about three taels. Hengxing also came to buy fiercely, and it rose to four and a half taels. However, the exchange market tended to loosen. Huabi issued March US dollars at 28.3125 yuan. Wanxing, Yongfeng, and Yuanmaoyong all came to sell. Qingfayong also issued, falling to three taels. Huabi issued even more half a yuan for May US dollars. Citibank also issued 375 for March. Yifengyong and Qingfayong continued to sell, falling by two and a half. Zhaofengchang bought in a little at this time, rising a few cents, but it still saw a decline. Hengyu and goods were all sold. Retail investors even went to 90 taels and 02 cents. Yuanmaoyong came on behalf of Bingxing to buy in, returning to two taels. Hengxing only then accepted, rising to two taels. But Fuyu issued a price limit of two taels, so the price could not rise, and it circled around. By the time of HSBC's foreign exchange, there was no special change. April US dollars were 5625, and May was 625, and it could be settled. The sale was recorded, breaking 90 taels and becoming 89 taels and two cents, but it was inevitable to hover. After this, news came that the Central Bank had opened 245 bars of spot trading, with a price of 90 taels and 05 cents. Dadexing and Qianchangxiang all came to enter bars, returning to 90 taels and 07 cents, but the exchange market was still loose. May US dollars 625 could not be sold, falling within 590 taels. The Central Bank had another move to open 70 bars, with a price of 90 taels. Dadexing went to the market to buy bars, and again to 90 taels and 09 cents, but when it reached its quota and withdrew, it still returned to within 90 taels. The exchange market also had no transaction. The market situation was calm for a long time. May's gold 6875 also could not be sold, and it became 88 taels and two cents. Hengxing still bought, adding one tael to nine taels. Retail investors still issued at eight and a half taels. Majiali ate half a yuan for February US dollars, rising to nine taels and six cents. Zhejiang stuffed out 6875 for May, and it fell back a little. By the time of the closing, it was 788 taels and eight cents. The goods were auctioned at eight taels and five cents.</p>
<h3 id="e188">Afternoon Has Been Supported <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon opening was 788 taels and seven cents. Tongfenghheng sold first, and it retreated from nine taels to eight taels. Retail investors bought in, starting a few cents. Richang sold a little, still at about eight taels. Yongfeng came to enter, at eight taels and four cents. At this time, there were few transactions, and the table was calm, only a few cents up and down. Hengyu and Qianchangxiang sold, breaking eight taels. Qingfayong and Yuanmaoyong sold seven taels. May US dollars were 75, because the bank was willing to issue them. Tianfengyong also sold, at six taels and six cents. Hengxing came to enter to seven taels, and Fuyu issued bars within seven taels. But Hengxing bought again and saw seven taels and four cents. Citibank stuffed out March US dollars 625, and Hengyu sold it, falling to six taels. Ruixing fiercely sold to within six taels. At this time, it hovered slightly around six taels. By the time Citibank continued to issue, February US dollars 625, May 875, the bank seemed willing to issue them. Dalian Gang Shunli came to sell, falling two taels to 84 taels and three cents. Dadexing entered to five taels, and Hongxing sold at Wang Liang. Hongli and others bought in a little, and the price was pulled up, and the competition lasted for a long time. The sales were sporadic. By the time Hengyu and Taifengcheng bought to five taels and five cents, but there were also a few cents up and down, because it was close to the closing, the multi-party and the short-selling party were both paying attention because of the double-opening price relationship, but because there were very few transactions, they were able to pull up. It once picked up to six taels and three cents. The situation was set, and finally fell back by three cents. The closing was 786 taels, and the goods were also auctioned at 86 taels. The highest price of the day was 794.5 taels, and the lowest price was 784 taels and three cents, with a difference of 10 taels and 02 cents. As a result, it rose by three taels compared to before the border closure.</p>

<p>Because of the four-day border closure, the transactions on the table were still prosperous yesterday when it opened. After entering, it was a little deserted. Hengxing, Fuyu, Yongfeng, Dadexing, Bingxing, Yuanmaoyong, Hongli, Shengda, and Daxingyong all entered. Hengyu, Wanxing, Qingfayong, Zhifengyong, Yifengyong, Qianchangxiang, Ruifeng, Yingfenghheng, Hongxing, and Shunli all issued. The Dalian gang Wanxing and Shunli all issued. Guang gang Hengxing bought in from beginning to end, about 600. Shengda also entered a small number. Yifeng was quiet.

<h3 id="e193">Exchange Market is Flat for British, Tight for American <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's exchange market stepped loosely. At first, because of the four-day border closure, the London large bars shrank a total of 125. The British-American and American-British exchange rates both fell, but the near-term asking price for the British exchange rate was 1 shilling and 8 pence, which was 125 tighter than before the border closure. The New York silver price shrank a total of 625, and the forward silver price also fell by more than six percent. But the bank's private telegram only reported a small half cent, so the opening US exchange rate was tight but not much. The near-term asking price was 28.25 yuan. After entering, it gradually hardened. HSBC listed British small 125, American small 25. The bank's appetite was still weak and they sold one after another. Huabi Citibank sold very hard. Zhejiang suddenly had a whole batch of US dollar heads being successively stuffed out, and the market situation became even harder. Some peers (gold industry) scraped in a little. In the afternoon, except for Citibank and Zhejiang, each bank had entries and exits from time to time. When it tended to harden, the April shilling was done at 25, and the May US dollar was done at 8125. The swap shilling was done for the February to May premium of 09375.

<p>Yesterday was the Five Roads Day of the abolished calendar. Qianzhuang started business. In the early morning market, the red plate was opened. Yangli was 7 cents, 1 point, 2 li, and 2 hao and a half, which was exactly the same as the morning market on January 25. The silver dismantling was white borrowing, and remittance bills were made. The early market was 890,000, and the banknotes were 120,000. There was no transaction in the noon market. In terms of dismantling bills, there were only 600,000 to 700,000 in the early market. In the afternoon, there were 300,000 to 400,000 transactions in the small general meeting. The bank bought and sold foreign exchange because the bank staff did not come to the market to trade, so most people who wanted to trade went to the door to ask for advice, so the amount could not be estimated. As for the collection and release news, it was only heard that the remittance collection and release was 300,000 to 400,000. Because the qianzhuang had just started business, there was no collection and release for other types of bills. The qianzhuang yang public single collection and release was hundreds of thousands, and the silver public single collection and release was less than one million. The small qianzhuang opened Jiangnan small foreign, and the early market was 6 cents and 2 points, with 5,000 corners traded.

<p>■The price suddenly rose firmly, ranging from one to two yuan■</p>
<p>■The transaction was more than 4.3 million yuan■</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Huashang Securities Exchange has resumed market transactions, but only the morning half-day market. In the afternoon, because the brokers said that the customers were not complete, it was decided to temporarily stop collecting. Therefore, although the exchange will open as usual in the next day, there is no market. Looking at the transaction situation in the half day, the futures are firm and rising, and the entry and exit are still prosperous. The transaction between the two markets was 4.36 million, of which only 65,000 yuan was accounted for by the tax in the February period. Although the spot goods were all opened, the total was only 9,000 yuan. In addition, the stock of the Huashang Securities Exchange, which has been in the coal market for a long time, also suddenly traded 10 shares, and the price was quite high. The market buying air was smooth, and the demand was greater than the supply. The one-way rise was quite strong. Among them, the futures for the disarmament skyrocketed by 2.7 yuan, and the unified tax of the 19th and 20th level also rose by about 2 yuan. Other also rose by about 1 yuan. Especially speaking of the current environment, its future trend is still in the middle of speech.</p>

<p>The Futures Market is Full of Desolation</p>
<p>The Current Sales Have Moved a Little to Embellish</p>
<p>Yesterday, the yarn was after the final settlement, and all industries started business, commonly known as the red plate transaction. The yarn market should have had a wave of hope. However, the war in the Northeast is full of clouds, foreign insults are urgent, financial exhaustion, and commercial special pheasant development, so the futures market is extremely bleak, and the market situation is still not free from weakness, and there is no revival of the atmosphere, but the real need is still called lively.</p>

<p>The pre-market opening situation of the people's standard was absolutely dull. Because in the abolished lunar new year, speculators still have no interest, resulting in very little business. Each month fell by one, two, three, and four cents. The afternoon opening rose slightly. Because the actual needs in the first half of the day were still good, but the lack of new buyers in the market became more and more scarce, and the business hours were very short, only 35 minutes, which is enough to see the coldness of the transaction. The total daily transaction was 8,700 packs. It was found that Yichang sold 700 packs, Changfeng 600 packs, Chunji 300 packs, Zhenda 300 packs, Yikang bought 500 packs, Jifeng 400 packs, Rongxing 450 packs, Xincheng 450 packs, and Tongyu 350 packs.

<p>The outlet for current yarn still needs to be smooth. After a week of holiday, various guilds have made slight progress, but it is greatly reduced compared to previous years. This is because of the economic emergency and the difficult livelihood of the villagers, resulting in a lack of purchasing power. According to the statistics of various guilds, 2,250 bales were traded. The market rose by 5 qian to 1 liang in the morning, and fell back by about 1 liang in the afternoon. The purchase amount from various parties is listed below:</p>
<p>Inland 680 Guangdong 585 Northern Guild 10 Xiamen 40</p>

<p>The cotton market is gradually entering a state of fatigue. During the seven-day holiday, the spot price of American cotton fell by 5 pound sounds compared to before the market closed, and Indian cotton fell by 45 rupees. However, the exchange rate has not changed, which has led to a decline in confidence. As for the inventory in various producing areas, they all have it, but the market price is not willing to relax. The bullish pulling force is still strong. It was heard in the afternoon that several hundred pieces of Indian cotton were being traded, and it was said that they would be shipped to Shanghai immediately, resulting in a sudden fatigue in morale and a decline in the market.</p>

<p>The Zheng Biao market opened earlier, but the decline in foreign cotton led to a lack of confidence. There were fewer buyers in the market, and prices for each month fell by 5 fen to 2 qian. In the afternoon, it was heard that foreign cotton was coming, and the bulls closed out their positions, causing the market to fall further. Prices for each month fell by another 5 fen to 2 qian. The total transaction volume for the day was 24,900 dan. It was found that Gengfeng sold 2,500 dan, Renfeng 1,000 dan, Changfeng 1,000 dan, Yu Chang 1,400 dan, and Yuanxingchang 1,700 dan.

<p>(Mumbai) There was not much speculation last week, and the market was calm. Initially, it was weak due to the progress of currency prices, and exports and factory demand failed to revive. Later, it was firm due to the frost in the Kojuora area. The demand in Yuedong and Europe is still inferior. The cloth head of Mumbai and Lamuda White is in stagnation, and there is no great hope in the cloth market. Manufacturers only buy cotton for urgent needs. The statistics for last week are attached below (unit: 1,000 bales):</p>
<p>1932 1932</p>
<p>Cumulative collection of levy from September 1 746 Exports to Europe 158</p>

<p>(Liverpool) Spot sales were quiet last week, and futures were bleak. The Mumbai gang sold out, and hedgers and peers bought in. The low market price was due to the currency price. The Egyptian cotton market was bleak and followed the overall market trend.</p>
<p>(Lancashire) Most cloth merchants, in view of the possibility of falling raw cotton prices, are unwilling to purchase except for essential needs. India continues to wait and see, and China is completely outside the market due to their New Year. In terms of activity, West Africa and Australia have concluded large quantities of goods, while South America has only a few transactions. A small number of yarn factories have sold at high prices.</p>

<h3 id="e205">Flour and Wheat Turn Weak <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>｜Flour Exchange New Year Only Trading for Half a Day in the Morning｜</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market, after opening in the morning, showed a preliminary steady and then falling trend in each month. Because the market was closed for a few days, the quotation for foreign wheat was better by two, three, or four jiao, so the morale was relatively stable at the beginning. However, because the actual sales guilds were waiting and watching, and there were few inquiries in the spot flour market, it was heard that only 2,000 bags were traded for the warship in the morning, adding 7.5 fen to the standard, and miscellaneous brands generally added 5 fen, which seemed to be much cheaper than the closing price in January of the previous year. Moreover, foreign wheat was still being touted endlessly. Australian wheat for January, February, and March shipment was only shouting 3 liang, 5 qian, and 8 fen, and manufacturers were offering 6 fen. Canadian wheat No. 3, it was heard that Xinda had traded 1,000 tons at a price of 3 liang, 5 qian, and 3 fen. Therefore, morale gradually became sluggish, which was very different from before the market closed. According to this situation, the later steps may have to turn weak. As a result, this month fell by 1.5 fen compared to before the market closed, March fell by 1.5 fen, April fell by 2 fen, May fell by 1.75 li, and June fell by 1.5 fen.</p>
<p>The Flour Exchange issued a market announcement that from today until February 4, trading will be held as usual in the morning, with two additional sessions, and trading will be suspended in the afternoon. Trading for July will also begin on February 1.</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the wheat futures market in the morning and afternoon, the prices of all months showed a consistent downward trend. Although the quotation for foreign wheat was slightly better by a few jiao compared to before the market closed, spot foreign wheat was still quoted at low prices. Although there are few problems in the near term, the long term is affected. Moreover, the chips in the hands of the traders have already been continuously fixed, and only about two-thirds of those who hedge have reached their targets. There is still a surplus, and they all want to take advantage of the situation to release their positions. Therefore, morale is very soft, and the opening price falls immediately, but the trading volume in the morning and afternoon is still sparse. As a result, this month was not opened, March fell by 6 fen, April fell by 8 fen, and there was no comparison for the rest.</p>

<p>14,000 Bags Arrived This Week</p>
<p>Yesterday's Hakka indica rice market was extremely desolate. Although it is customary for red-plate trading to realize prosperity, due to the current unstable situation, floating morale, and the financial sector's failure to release loans, the transactions of the Hakka guilds have not yet been launched. It is expected that there will be an opportunity for prosperity around the Lantern Festival. Only the Beiyang Guild and the Fujian Province handled 551 bags of Jiangxi machine-made rice, priced at 9 yuan, 2 jiao, and 5 fen to 9 yuan and 1 jiao, which is a drop of nearly jiao compared to the last high price of last year. The Hakka indica rice inventory is slightly available. In the week at the end of the year and the beginning of the year, a total of 14,000 new bags arrived, all loaded from Hunan and Jiangxi provinces. There has been no proper handling of foreign rice, and the inventory has been rejected by foreign firms and account holders, and there has been no sale.</p>

There are more than 20 Su Tong guilds at the Nanshi wharf, 6 or 7 Nangang guilds, and more than 10 Qingjiao guilds, totaling more than 40 guilds. The rice stalls have been set up, and it is immediately approved to change to the market bushel from the opening of the bushel. Each market bushel is one shi, which is calculated at 85% of the sea bushel market price at the time of the big settlement.</p>

<p>The miscellaneous grain red plate market is still stable and lively. The Guangdong guild is searching for 5,000 bags of Niuzhuang black soybeans, priced at 3 liang and 5 qian. The market temporarily looks stable, with no great honor or disgrace. Factories are waiting and watching on soybeans, and the Guangdong guild is also handling them, and the market situation is fair. It is expected that there will be little change in the future. Yesterday, the Guangdong guild handled five carts of Dalian soybeans and Andong soybeans. The traders matched three carts of Xicheng soybeans from the inland guilds and 600 bags of Chongming sand yellow. The green beans from Dalian were picked up by this street for 200 bags. Mung beans are still actively sold, and about 1,000 bags have been traded for shipment to Hong Kong and Luzon via the Guangdong guild. Quanzhou guilds are inquiring about Jiujiang black sesame seeds, but because there is not much goods and the profits are extremely thin, the market is stable. Foreign firms are not moving on white sesame seeds, and only a small number of traders on this street are picking them up. Raw red sorghum is rising, and the Guangdong guild is trading for red plate social events, so the market is spared from expansion. Medium and inferior goods are stable, and a total of more than 3,000 bags were traded yesterday. Only the rural villages are moving on red grains, with no major changes. Hong Kong also has outlets for kidney beans, and the market is stable. The oil market has no market because it has changed to a new system and must wait until the market opens on February 1.</p>

<p>｜The Number Plate is Still Not Open Due to the Implementation of the Market Scale｜</p>
<p>Yesterday's North Goods market, although there was a plan, the transaction was still sparse. The prices of all goods have increased compared to before, but it is feared that the actual market may not be able to follow the prices exactly. The details will be provided tomorrow. The dried longan market is expected to increase by two or three liang differently. For example, Jiechun Zheng Er is set at 65 liang, the rest of the top-grade screened Zhuang is 31 liang, Tianji is 18 liang, Tianhong is 13 liang, Chuban is 9 liang, Shangdang Yuanzhi is 24 liang, and Bianzhi is 27 or 28 liang. The number plate is still not open due to the implementation of the market scale.</p>

<h3 id="e227">New Year's Eve <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Xiaomei</p>
<p>"Once the heart is warmed, seeking my will for twenty-six years!"</p>
<p>I collected these two lines of poetry by Gong Zizhen and wrote them on a photo I just picked up from the photo studio yesterday, because tonight is Lunar New Year's Eve, and after this night, I will be twenty-seven years old!</p>
<p>Indeed, in the past I did get warmth in my heart, but now, only some cold fragrance remains in my memories! Memories may be sentimental, they are always tempting me, sometimes I always think like this.</p>
<p>Childhood innocence is the easiest thing to disappear, and so is the joy of childhood. I was happy when I was five or six years old, but now it's no use just reminiscing, because it's too blurry. People aged one to nine are the happiest, and they know it themselves, but my loving father died that year! What else can I say when I lost the key to paradise at a young age!</p>
<p>What I think I've gotten some joy from is, of course, the few years when I was nearing adulthood, but now looking back, it's only enough to make me regret it, because such joy probably won't exist anymore! Recently I've always been melancholic!</p>
<p>Yesterday, Limin used Wei Huanhua's "Riding a horse and leaning on a slanting bridge, the whole building beckons with red sleeves" to paint a picture for me, I carefully played with it, and couldn't help but feel a sense of sadness, so I tied a stanza of "Stepping on the Sand" to it;</p>
<p>"Red sleeves beckon people, emerald tongues understand, calling for the green horse to stop; turning the reins, leaning on the slanting bridge is a painful loss of soul! The spring scenery remains, but the heart's desire is mistaken, fearing to reach the road; the weeping willows in the building sway, and no one at the top of the building prolongs..."</p>
<p>After writing this stanza, I really only feel lost! Everything in the past is completely illusory like a dream. Yi Han saw Limin's painting and my lyrics, and knew that I was touched by it again, so he also filled in a stanza of "Pearl Curtain" and titled it on the end of the painting for me, his lyrics are like this...</p>
<p>"In March in the south of the Yangtze River, the slanting sun sets, galloping with a saddle, traversing the road back to Zhangtai; the wind is swift, the horse's hooves are light, pulling the embroidered curtains of vermilion doors; suddenly raising his head, the red sleeves are raised, and then holding back, wanting to go back; let's stay, listen to the words in front of the curtain, conveying words for her. Don't say that in the old days, we had a clear tour, a three-life vow, and several times of clouds and rain. The fur coat and horse are tattered in the spring breeze, so drifting! The young master returns, the fragrant intentions cease, and the hair turns white in thousands of strands, thousands of strands, facing the swaying weeping willows, adding to the sadness!"</p>
<p>After reading his lyrics, I thought even more of the joys of the past and the desolation of today, and a sense of sadness kept welling up in my heart! I don't care if my friends see it and scold me for having the air of a "leftover young master" again, or give me other, more unpleasant criticisms, I just stick this painting on the wall.</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will be twenty-seven years old, and the so-called beautiful years, happiness, and warmth in my heart, except in the paintings on the wall, in the dreams of the deep night, and in the vague memories, I can find some shadows, nothing else will be there.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Watching a Fight <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>We Chinese people always like to say that we love peace, but in fact, we love to fight, we love to watch other things fight, and we also love to watch ourselves fight.</p>
<p>The most common are cockfights and cricket fights. In the south, there are fights with yellow-headed birds and thrushes, and in the north, there are quail fights. A group of idle people surround and stare, and even gamble on the outcome. In ancient times, there were fish fights, and now magicians can make fleas fight. Reading this year's "Shenbao Monthly" made me realize that Jinhua also has bullfights, but it's different from Spain. In Spain, people fight bulls, but we have bulls fighting bulls.</p>
<p>Let them fight, not getting involved ourselves, just watching.</p>
<p>However, the warlords are not fighting in person either, they are making the soldiers fight, so there are frequent years of war, but the bosses are all fine in the end, suddenly misunderstandings are resolved, suddenly they drink and laugh, suddenly they defend against foreign insults together, suddenly they swear to serve the country, suddenly... Needless to say, suddenly they will inevitably fight again.</p>
<p>But our fighters are different when it comes to foreign enemies. The recent one is "non-resistance", and the distant one is "carrying crossbows to lead the way".</p>
<p>"Non-resistance" is already clearly stated in the words. "Carrying crossbows to lead the way", the method of manufacturing crossbows has long been lost, and must be researched by archaeologists and manufactured before they can be carried and lead the way.</p>
<p>Let's just keep the domestically produced soldiers and the currently purchased weapons and continue fighting ourselves. If we want to do this, naturally, we must sometimes "love peace".</p>
<h3 id="e229">Frontline (2) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Wen</p>
<p>That night, the three of them were assigned as sentries. Zhou Sanbao was the squad leader, and he himself served as the acting squad leader. Sentries were assigned in pairs, and the first pair was Agen and Dafa. The wind was blowing so hard, whistling and roaring, and it felt a little numb and prickly on the body, and the thick cotton coat couldn't resist the cold. However, the cold couldn't threaten them. Both of them were thinking about something in their hearts. This kind of appearance on the front line made them think that if imperialism could be destroyed in the world, like the cannons and bombs that destroyed many houses nearby, they would feel even more excited.</p>
<p>"Hey, don't you usually specialize in talking about overthrowing imperialism and many oppressed people, Agen?"</p>
<p>Dafa's words startled Agen, who was thinking hard.</p>
<p>"Yes, these things must be overthrown!"</p>
<p>"I always say that fighting is not a good thing. This time, overthrowing imperialism is naturally different, but are the Japanese soldiers also imperialists? I think about it and it doesn't seem to make much sense."</p>
<p>"Imperialism oppressed them and used them, so, in order to overthrow imperialism, we can no longer care about these things. Haven't you heard that when Japanese soldiers see us rushing over here, they run away nine out of ten times?"</p>
<p>"Dong... Pa Da, Pa Da,... Chi..." In the middle of the distant machine gun fire, a cannon suddenly sounded, so clear in the black night even from a distance, stopping Agen's words on the tip of his tongue.</p>
<p>After three or four minutes, another one came in the same way, and the machine gun continued to fire.</p>
<p>"Wow! It's burning so fiercely over there!"</p>
<p>Dafa followed Agen's hand pointing in the vague direction, and a large patch of red light was shining in a corner of the dark sky. Dafa stared blankly for a long time. This was the Japanese soldiers setting fire to the houses of the common people, and it had been burning for several days, and the fire brigade would not rush to put it out.</p>
<p>The wind was getting stronger and stronger. Listening to the distant gunfire, the two of them stopped talking. When it was time to change shifts, they woke Sande and Zhou Sanbao. Sande rubbed his eyes, wrapped his cotton coat tightly, and carefully stepped over his comrades' heads and feet, and walked to the sentry post.</p>
<p>Many chaotic sounds woke them all up from their sleep. Opening their eyes, they understood what was happening. They could only hear more cannon fire and gunfire than last night. The comrades all jumped up from their blankets and hurried to pack their things. The company commander and deputy company commander were also hurrying and surrounded.</p>
<p>The enemy's machine gun bullets flew over like raindrops, and the cannons also flew over their heads with a "chi... chi..." sound. But the machine guns and automatic rifles here also sent back fire without letting up, and the artillery behind them also fired small steel cannons. Their ears were filled with noise all the time, and their hands were also busy loading bullets and turning the gun knobs.</p>
<p>A cannon shell exploded right on the house to the left of the position, and the bricks and tiles flew in all directions like powder, and the ground seemed to shake.</p>
<p>At this time, they had to advance under the fire of both sides, because the fire was too fierce, the company commander ordered everyone to lie down on the ground and crawl, crawling as fast as running. When they approached the front line, everyone raised their bodies a little, and sprayed the rifles and light machine guns like sprinkling water. Just then, the regiment on the right also reached a similar location, and they smoothly rushed forward. The enemy's cannons flew over their heads one after another, and the enemy also rushed forward in skirmish lines. When they saw the troops here, they were a little panicked and stopped advancing, turning their automatic rifles to full automatic and sweeping. The troops here were not blocked by the bullets, but instead fixed bayonets on their rifles and rushed to their faces.</p>
<p>In this way, shooting was useless, and the enemy's bayonets were also fixed.</p>
<p>"Kill! Kill... kill all the Japanese!"</p>
<p>"Down with imperialism!"</p>
<p>This earth-shattering shout covered the shining bayonets, and the people on both sides engaged in hand-to-hand combat. Blood flowed over their uniforms and onto the ground, trampled by countless feet. The people who fell struggled to jump up again.</p>
<p>"Down with all imperialism!"</p>
<p>Shouting like that, desperately stabbing the bayonet towards the enemy. Five-sixths of the enemy had already dropped their guns and slipped away, and only those surrounded in the middle were resisting frantically for the sake of survival.</p>
<p>But the order to retreat came. This order instead aroused louder shouts, tightly surrounding the enemy. When forced to retreat, everyone cursed with a mixture of pleasure and hatred, looking at the bright red bloodstains on their bayonets. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e230">A Glimpse of the January 28th Battle Exhibition <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenfu</p>
<p>In the Confucius Temple in the Nanshi district, after the city government transformed it, a January 28th Battle Exhibition was specially set up inside. There are many tourists. Because I only passed by in a hurry, I can't give a detailed account of these wounds that are so painful to reflect on, so I can only briefly talk about them.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the stone steps, the first thing that catches the eye is the weapon that the violent Japanese used to kill our compatriots. In the middle of the courtyard, a square wooden pavilion is built, and a 600-pound aircraft bomb is suspended in the pavilion. In front of the bomb is a half table, and on the table is the scrap iron from the destroyed Wusong artillery. On the wooden frame on the right is a bursting shell of a field gun, and on the right is a small aircraft bomb. These bombs that have fortunately not exploded are all weapons used by Japanese imperialism to kill our compatriots. What do we really think about them! Behind the bomb are two glass bottles of liquid medicine. The one on the left is immersed in a leg destroyed by a dumdum bullet, and the one on the right is immersed in an arm injured by a bursting shell. The swollen flesh and terrible cracks make us see even more hatred for the enemy's cruelty. But this is only one or two out of thousands. Can we count the actual killings suffered by our compatriots!</p>
<p>In a room directly facing the courtyard, many photos are displayed on both sides...such as the documents of the negotiations between China and Japan before the war, the plundering of businesses after the outbreak of the war, the burning of the Oriental Library, and photos labeled "trampling", "fire", and "atrocities". In addition, there are photos of our army resisting the enemy and photos of military engineering, the People's Volunteer Army and the Women's Ambulance Team, etc., which fully demonstrate our military and civilians' efforts to resist the enemy. Also, after the war stopped, photos were taken of the ruins of broken walls and the relics destroyed by the enemy.</p>
<p>On the left side of the room are many consolation works by Japanese elementary school students, including texts and drawings. What is shown here is the traditional thought of imperialism...loyalty to the emperor, patriotism, military aggression, and triumphant victory.</p>
<p>At the end of these elementary school students' paintings and calligraphy are documents, photos, seals, etc. of Hu Lifu, Chang Yuqing and other people. We see how the enemy's elementary schools are encouraging patriotism, and how the traitors Hu and Chang are so heartless. In contrast, it really makes people sigh!</p>
<p>In a room on the left side of the courtyard, there are also several photos of female volunteers and nurses. Inside the glass case are small portraits of the fallen soldiers and descriptions of the January 28th Incident, as well as abstracts of the report. A Japanese monk's robe and the Red Cross field ambulance bed of the German-Chinese Medical Association are hanging under the wall. The bed cloth is stained with blood, and the startling words are marked on it: "Where is the bone buried? The bloodstains remain!"</p>
<p>When we commemorate the great wounds and strange humiliations of January 28th, we should think...what kind of gifts should we use to repay our enemies? What preparations do we have to wash away our shame? How should we fulfill the unfinished responsibilities of the dead to be worthy of our compatriots who died?</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>As he spoke, he remembered the scene when Tang Yaoxing took him to meet the famous revolutionary literary master Chen Huamin that night. Chen Huamin had instilled many revolutionary theories into him. He wanted to sell the half-baked revolutionary theories that he had learned to Madame Hezi. But after thinking about it, he felt bored again and held back.</p>
<p>After hurriedly eating dinner at the Ren family's house that night, he rushed to Tang Yaoxing's residence, and then Tang Yaoxing took him to a small cafe where he met four or five modern writers. He had always admired these writers very much. But after meeting them, he felt that they were as ordinary as he was. At that moment, he had a feeling...</p>
<p>"Probably human beings themselves are the most mediocre animals."</p>
<p>He learned many revolutionary theories and literary theories from them, filling his head. But after walking out and being blown by the cold wind, it was like a deflated balloon. What was left was only their sighs, the sighs of this one saying he was poor and that one saying he was trapped.</p>
<p>Thinking of those writers lamenting their suffering, he thought of the emptiness of his own wallet. He felt a kind of inexplicable sadness again.</p>
<p>"Tonight there will be another unexpected expense!"</p>
<p>He wanted to take a breath again, but quickly held back. He walked along with Madame Hezi, feeling as if she had been snatched back from that Japanese guy tonight, and from now on she would be his alone. He felt a kind of deformed and stimulating pleasure again.</p>
<p>"I am completely the lowest kind of animal. Probably this is a unique temperament of the Chinese people. I obviously have "an improper desire for Madame Hezi, which is shameless, but having come out with her, touring around can't be considered a crime. Why am I so afraid of being seen by others, this is cowardly. If I want to have fun, I have to spend money, if I can't bear to spend money, then I shouldn't come out to have fun. But I only care about my wallet, this is stinginess. I don't make progress, I can't make thorough efforts, I just envy the fruits of other people's labor, this is the worst, jealousy... Where am I the noble and promising youth that Liangzhu imagined?</p>
<p>When Haiquan thought of this, he felt that his whole body was stained with foul filth. Besides jumping into the Huangpu River immediately, there was really no way to save himself from the mire of baseness.</p>

<h3 id="e232">A Rhyme Pair and a Swing Pair <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>"The north of the house is beautiful and sleeps alone, the west of the stream is like a magpie, this is the legendary rhyme pair. In fact, the second line is indeed in the same rhyme of the eighth level tone of the upper level, but the first line is not in the same rhyme, only because this word "north" is not in the entering tone of "one house", but in "thirteen years". Last year, Wang Jingwei and Zhang Hanqing had disagreements over Tang Yulin's military pay, almost becoming a stalemate; I once jokingly made a rhyme couplet, called... "Wang Zhang discussed Tang's rations, stiff, stiff, stiff..." soliciting the second line, but no one has responded. Recently, I received a letter from Yun Jianyi He, who found a second line in the same rhyme of "one house", called... "Lu Shi rushed to chase the bamboo house, nurturing, nurturing, nurturing." He said... "After reading the Four Heroes of Tang, Zhu, Wen and Zhou, I came up with this second line. Lu Zhu is Lu Zhaorong and Zhu Zhishan. Pushing and chasing the bamboo house means Lu Zhaorong rushed into Zhu's house. Zhu and Zhu are borrowed homophones. Nurturing, nurturing, nurturing is Zhu Zhishan's cry of pain, only because part of his beard was pulled out by Lu Zhaorong." This second line is really an incredible match.</p>
<p>The swing couplet is the meaning of turning back and forth, and one sentence becomes two sentences; the legendary first line is called... "Guests go up to the natural residence, surprisingly guests in heaven;" for a time no one could find the second line. Later, someone replied... "People pass the Great Buddha Temple, the temple Buddha is greater than people." The Great Buddha Temple is only one place in the country; the most famous is the Great Buddha Temple in Ganzhou, which is unusually grand and magnificent. In the main hall, there is a large Buddha statue, lying down, ten feet long; behind it, there are several large Buddha statues. The head of the Great Buddha is pillowed on a lotus flower, and the body is draped in a golden cassock, and the Dharma image is particularly dignified. There is a pagoda behind the temple, built in the Tang Dynasty; the year of the temple stele was the 29th year of the Wanli period of the Ming Dynasty; the shape of the pagoda is square at the bottom, round in the middle, and pointed at the top, and the middle contains dozens of small Buddha statues. There is a small pagoda of the same shape at each of the four corners of the pagoda base.</p>

<p>| Please the Public Differentiate the Taste |</p>
<p>I was in the market, and it seemed that someone said...</p>
<p>"The so-called Northeast is just weak in the East! This Northeast is probably not the Northeast of China's Southeast, Northwest, but the Northeast of another world; if I am wrong, then why haven't we taken back an inch of lost land after more than a year of being trampled by the violent Japanese iron hooves? ......" Enough, I don't want to listen anymore. If I listen any longer, even the land I'm standing on may tremble because of it |</p>
<p>The so-called Northeast is definitely Chinese territory. The word Northeast includes the four provinces of Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, and Rehe. The land there is twice as large as the violent Japanese, and the minerals and forests are so rich that they drool! As for the population, there are more than 30 million people. Now, because the workers and peasants in those areas have been disturbed by the violent Japanese and have no work to do and no land to cultivate; everyone has embraced great ambitions and joined the Volunteer Army one after another, fighting hard to kill the bandits, so that there is a way to survive. But although they are brave and good at fighting, they don't have sharp weapons to resist. All they have are old-fashioned guns and broadswords, but that's enough for them to attack. I heard that when they run out of dry food and cold water, they eat sand when they are hungry and drink horse urine when they are thirsty! Oh! They also have round heads and square feet, and they are all our compatriots. Although they are fighting to restore those areas, their just purpose is to restore the entire nation! Oh! Drunken and dreaming compatriots, when they are drinking horse urine and eating sand; it is when you are hugging left and right, a glass of grape juice, a serving of tomato mandarin fish! I humbly plead on behalf of the Northeast Volunteer Army, and advise you to save some of the meager funds for your appetite and make a little contribution to the Northeast relief fund!</p>

<p>｜One's Own Foundation is Shaken｜</p>
<p>I have not studied philology, and I fundamentally know nothing about the so-called pictographs, ideographs, derivative cognates, phonetic loans, compound ideographs, and self-explanatory characters in philology, let alone bronze inscriptions and oracle bone inscriptions. But I still presumptuously come to interpret this character "中" (Zhōng - Middle), inevitably inviting ridicule from philologists. However, although I am not fortunate enough to be able to study the evolution of characters like playing with antiques in piles of books and oracle bones, the "中" (Zhōng - Middle) that I want to explain now is simply because I feel that the interpretation of this "中" (Zhōng - Middle) has been fundamentally shaken, and I am merely describing what I have seen.</p>
<h3 id="e235">Beginning of Illness <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Gēng Bái</p>
<p>Continuous light overcast days accompany my illness,</p>
<p>A sudden joy as the clear light fills the curtain's folds.</p>
<p>From Yuguan last night, urgent military dispatches arrive,</p>
<p>Awakening the poetic soul to turn further east.</p>
<p>Quietly, no one speaks in this deep, solitary building,</p>
<p>Forsaking the week, I embrace the quilt alone.</p>
<p>I love Ding Gong's tearful words,</p>
<p>"A hero lamenting his twilight years feels the weight of gold."</p>
<p>The status of the character "中" (Zhōng - Middle) is probably the most authoritative in our country. The name of the country is China (中國), and the highest centralized authority is called the Central Government (中央).</p>
<p>Xǔ Shèn of the Han Dynasty explained "中" (Zhōng - Middle) as "centering, from ｜." Although the form of this character "中" (Zhōng - Middle) remains unchanged, its interpretation can no longer maintain neutrality. For example, the character "中" (Zhōng - Middle) could previously be interpreted as impartial and unbiased, hence the mediator was called 中人 (zhōng rén - middle person). However, the League of Nations, which now assumes the role of mediator in the Sino-Japanese dispute, is actually biased towards Japan. Hasn't this "中" (Zhōng - Middle) lost its original meaning of impartiality? What is strange is that our country, which advocates moderation (中庸) as its national philosophy, still relies on this paper tiger.</p>
<p>Recently, inferior goods have been dumped on our country's market. Ordinary people, greedy for their cheap prices, all buy and use them. Therefore, those who advocate for national goods are very frustrated. Frustrated, in the Wu dialect, is "甕中" (wèng zhōng - in a jar/urn). (Whether this term is accurate or not still awaits Mr. Zhān Lú's verification.) Alas! In this year of advocating for national goods, if the people do not rise up again and adopt national goods, once our country's economy collapses, not only will the patriots who advocate for national goods be "甕中" (wèng zhōng - trapped in a jar), but all of our citizens will probably be "甕中之𪔀" (wèng zhōng zhī biē - turtles in a jar), and the country will also be "甕内之中國" (wèng nèi zhī zhōng guó - China inside a jar). At that time, regretting and being "甕中" (wèng zhōng - trapped in a jar) will be too late.</p>
<p>We have talked about the character "中" (Zhōng - Middle) in terms of international affairs and the country, and now let's talk about the general public. The majority of our people are illiterate. However, there are probably quite a few who can recognize this character "中" (Zhōng - Middle). Perhaps the carpenter next door or the little brother across the street can recognize it when they see it. If you put three mahjong tiles, "中" (Zhōng - Middle), "發" (fā - fortune), and "白" (bái - white), together, they will definitely not mistake "發財" (fā cái - to get rich) for "中風" (zhōng fēng - to have a stroke).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the new interpretation of the character "中" (Zhōng - Middle) is no longer impartial, but rather collapsing to the east and west. The reason why China is called "中" (Zhōng - Middle) is because it is really useless, has become the target of public criticism, and is a sacrificial victim in the tiger's mouth.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Regarding Donations from Overseas Chinese <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>

<p>｜Contrary to the Ideal of the Average Person｜</p>
<p>In this unprecedented national crisis, with the loss of over three million square li of land, overseas Chinese are very concerned and have been actively raising funds to assist the anti-Japanese armies. According to the ideal of the average person, overseas Chinese are always rich, and as long as they are not stingy, they can donate as much as they want without any difficulty. But in reality, how can it be so easy? Don't think that just because you see in the newspapers that overseas Chinese in a certain place donated tens of thousands, or in a certain place donated thousands, you can take it as proof of this ideal. In fact, it is very difficult for overseas Chinese to donate! First, there are indeed many wealthy overseas Chinese, but the donations remitted back to the country come mostly from small merchants and laborers, who are wholeheartedly patriotic, and the majority of the donations remitted back to the country are collected from their hard-earned money. This is the case in the Singapore area of ​​Southeast Asia. Second, it is not easy for overseas Chinese to collect donations, because it is not a few wealthy people quietly taking out money. As soon as someone initiates a donation campaign, it will attract the attention of foreign governments in various places. For example, in the various regions of Southeast Asia, foreign governments mostly do not want to offend Japan, but they can arbitrarily oppress the Chinese. Therefore, in this national crisis, the overseas Chinese's fundraising and boycott of Japanese goods have been severely suppressed. Overseas Chinese have no choice but to change the name, not saying that they are collecting funds to assist the anti-Japanese armies, but saying that they are providing relief to compatriots in the war zones. Otherwise, not only will they not be allowed to raise funds, but even if they have money, they will not be able to remit it out. It is so difficult for overseas Chinese to donate, isn't it contrary to the ideal of the average person! The reason, of course, is that our country is too weak, and the suffering of overseas Chinese is far more than this!</p>

<p>Opium, relieves qi and calms the nerves, the source of life. The hope in Father to make a final attempt became active again. Mother sat on the edge of the bed with tearful eyes, and Hongye and his elder brother knelt far away on the ground. Father struggled once, twice, three times, and finally sighed quietly...</p>
<p>"Alright, since you have this intention, I'll give it a try for the time being."</p>
<p>Father's promise was like obtaining the elixir of the living Buddha Jigong. Everyone was so happy that they walked with energy. Elder brother immediately hired a rickshaw and borrowed the equipment. Mother was so excited that she cut open four watermelons in a row for the servants and children to eat.</p>
<p>The equipment arrived, and Father suddenly changed his mind. He didn't like seeing the dark and dirty gun. He was only willing to load a bit and soak it in Mother's dry tobacco pipe and smoke it. Because he had never smoked dry tobacco before, he coughed violently after taking two puffs. It was only after repeated persuasion that elder brother lit the pipe and he reluctantly took a large puff. In the evening, Hongye was reading a book under the oil lamp, and only heard Father pounding the bed,</p>
<p>"Ai! I can't sleep even more! I know it's a stimulating thing."</p>
<p>The thick smoke from the mosquito repellent made of wood chips filled the room, causing Hongye to shed tears. However, the mosquitoes' eyes were certainly particularly small. They still happily buzzed and sought each other, coming to be close to this old rain that had been a guest in a foreign land for a long time. Father couldn't sleep in bed and complained of feeling suffocated. Hongye hung up the mosquito net for him, sat on the edge of the bed, gently fanning away the mosquitoes, and in the lamplight, looked at Father's haggard face, with his eyes swollen to only a line. He tossed and turned, unable to sleep peacefully. Hongye thought for a long time, and with a smiling face, said,</p>
<p>"Dad, want to hear a joke?"</p>
<p>Father shook his head, "Get me a cigarette."</p>
<p>Hongye lit a cigar, and Father took two puffs. Feeling bitter, he threw away the cigarette and closed his eyes again. The room was silent except for the ticking of the small alarm clock. A large flower had formed on the wick of the oil lamp, emitting only a faint green light. The bean oil on the lamp was also absorbed, leaving only a shallow ring at the bottom. Suddenly, with a thud outside the window, something furry jumped in! Hongye was so frightened that his hair stood on end, and with a soft cry, Father opened his eyes,</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"A tabby cat." (6)</p>

<p>Mr. Huáng Jǐngwán, everyone knows that he is a social butterfly who shakes the sea; his every move is very quick and agile, purely natural, not adhering to trivialities, and unrestrained. For example, when dealing with you in the summer, he will smile and lean on his waist, holding a straw hat in one hand and spinning it, while bowing hurriedly and running. Sometimes when he is anxious, his eyes will widen suddenly, and at the same time, you will see him shaking his head, waving his hands, and looking angry, as if something terrible has happened. Sometimes when he is sick, he will be like a child, frowning lazily and speaking softly. Friends all think that he is a person with an optimistic outlook on life; in fact, his humorous attitude often contains new creativity.</p>
<p>However, few people know that Mr. Huáng has passed the "thirty" age but does not yet have a lifelong partner; although his girlfriends are like clouds. However, friends, let me tell you!

<h3 id="e240">Selling Official Positions <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Kū (Cry)</p>
<p>"My" lord has talked about selling the country. Today I will talk about selling official positions. The issue of selling the country is major, while the issue of selling official positions is minor. Selling the country is an issue for the entire country, while selling official positions is only a local issue. Therefore, selling the country can be discussed, and selling official positions is not impossible to discuss.</p>
<p>In fact, based on the facts, no one in our country has the qualification to sell the country. The so-called seller must have one side giving money and the other side giving goods, with a corresponding price. I ask, has the loss of any land rights in our country earned a corresponding price? We are only giving away the country, letting the country. People are the knives and cutting boards, and we are the fish and meat. We are a country at the mercy of others. Where is there any selling of the country to speak of?</p>
<p>Therefore, I will not talk about selling the country, but rather about selling official positions. "Selling official positions and titles" has always been our country's traditional policy. "The Yin Dynasty followed the rites of the Xia Dynasty." We can know the gains and losses. However, it is a case of azure coming from indigo, but surpassing it. Therefore, although selling official positions is the same, the methods are different. In the past, a certain province sold official positions. The fixed price was 10,000 for a zhīshì (prefect), and 8,000 for a bureau. Now this method has become a thing of the past. Our country has not made progress in other types of politics, but the methods of selling official positions have progressed at a rate of a thousand miles a day.</p>
<p>What are the current methods of selling official positions?</p>
<p>There is the so-called selling the old but not the new. What does it mean to sell the old but not the new? There are endless wonders in it. If one wants to sell an official position, one must consider the difficulties of the receiver. Suppose the receiver is a poor scholar? He does not have much sin-making money to invest. If he has sin-making money, he is afraid that after investing it, there will be no corresponding guarantee and price. So-called "trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice." He doesn't dare to make a hasty move. If one uses the method of selling the old but not the new, then a few county magistrates and bureau chiefs, sirs, already have "mǎikā mǎikā" (money, money) at their sides. They already know the ordinary income and the extra squeezes like the back of their hand. Naturally, it is easy to invest and go to work. This is one of the wonderful uses of selling the old but not the new.</p>
<p>In addition, there is a detailed condition attached. That is, a county vacancy costs 10,000 per year, and 5,000 per half year. If you sell the vacancy, and let you work for a long time, it would be too cheap. Therefore, a time limit is added. Those who pay 5,000 are only allowed to work for half a year, and those who pay 10,000 are only allowed to work for a year. The longer the time, the more the price is extrapolated. This method of selling official positions is considered thorough. It can both gain a reputation for not changing things easily, and it can also occupy the position of dividing the spoils while sitting. How precise and practical is this plan!</p>
<p>Since the official position is bought with a corresponding price, naturally one will do everything possible to desperately squeeze. Afterwards, every detail will be examined, and in the end, it is still the common people who deserve to die. Since the official position is sold with corresponding conditions, even if the official commits crimes and abuses his power, even if the common people want to go to the superiors to cry and complain, naturally it will not be effective. In the end, it is also the common people who deserve to die.</p>

<h3 id="e242">The Reason for Sleep <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Yǐ Líng</p>
<p>Natural science in the 20th century can be considered developed, especially the field of physiology, which has truly shown a great momentum in the last century! However, in fact, there are still many physiological phenomena that we are still unclear about. Now, let's just take one of the most common and most important physiological phenomena - the reason for sleep - to discuss...</p>
<p>If a person has a lifespan of sixty years, then he will spend at least twenty years of his life in the land of sleep. Everyone knows the importance of sleep for animals. We can survive more than ten days without food, and three or four days without drink, but we cannot go three days without sleep. However, "What is the reason for sleep?" Few people can answer!</p>
<p>"What is the reason for sleep?" Not only is this question unclear to the average person, but physiologists around the world also have many different opinions, and no one dares to give a definitive answer. The more influential explanations include the brain ischemia theory, the fatigue substance theory, and the hereditary habit theory, and so on. Now, let's discuss them separately.</p>
<p>(A) Brain Ischemia Theory: This school of thought explains sleep as being due to brain ischemia. Why does the blood in the brain decrease for no reason? It is said that it is because the cerebral arteries constrict, and the brain tissue is therefore not getting enough nutrition, so one becomes drowsy. Mr. Mosso used precise instruments to test a person who had lost a large piece of his skull. The results proved that the brain pulse (that is, the pulsation of the blood vessels in the brain) was lower than usual during sleep. Someone also used a very simple, very accurate, and very interesting experiment to prove that the brain is indeed anemic during sleep, that is, they had a person lie straight on a T-shaped seesaw, and at the same time told him to close his eyes and eliminate all thoughts (until he fell asleep), then moved the seesaw to a level position; finally, they woke him up and asked him to calculate a simple math problem (r2Xr5‖?.) At this time, even though he had not moved at all, the balance of the seesaw was broken - the end near the head tilted slightly downward.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, it seems that the reason for sleep is undoubtedly brain ischemia, and brain ischemia is due to the constriction of the cerebral arteries. But why do these blood vessels constrict for no reason? Some people's sleep time is very fixed. Why do the cerebral blood vessels constrict at the time of sleep, neither earlier nor later? In short, the above two experiments only proved the physiological phenomenon of sleep - the fluid in the brain decreases, but did not explain the reason for sleep.</p>
<p>(B) Fatigue Substance Theory: What is a fatigue substance? - It is a kind of waste produced by the work of body tissues (for example, the contraction and relaxation of the muscles of the lower limbs when walking) - lactic acid and carbon dioxide. Originally, these wastes are carried away by the blood at any time, but if the muscles are exercised excessively and too much waste is produced, the blood cannot completely flush it away, and part of it accumulates in the muscles, so we feel tired. Some physiologists have hypothesized that "we want to sleep because the central nervous system is stimulated by fatigue substances." Someone once injected a liquid extracted from extremely tired muscles into an ordinary animal. Soon, this animal showed signs of fatigue and drowsiness.</p>
<p>But the problem comes... According to the fatigue substance theory, "labor produces lactic acid," and the nerves are stimulated, so one wants to sleep; but newborn babies rarely labor, so their nerves should not be stimulated by lactic acid. In other words, they should sleep very little, but the opposite is true. Newborn babies need to sleep for twenty hours, and after a month, they still need to sleep for fifteen or sixteen hours, and then gradually decrease. In short, age and sleep time are inversely proportional. How can fatigue substance theorists explain this?</p>
<p>(C) Habit Theory: In the era when humans lived in caves and the wilderness, in order to prevent attacks by wild animals, they would hide in caves at night, maintaining absolute silence to avoid being heard by wild animals. Over time, it became a habit of having to sleep at night.</p>
<p>But how do you explain some people who need to sleep during the day? Moreover, this theory deviates from the scope of physiology and is even more difficult to believe!</p>
<p>What is the reason for sleep? - We still don't know!</p>
<h3 id="e243">Yuánbǎo (Ingot) Tea and Asking for Lucky Money <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Yǐng Dāi</p>
<p>Although the slogan of abolishing the old calendar has been shouted for many years, the national calendar has not yet been implemented, and the lunar New Year has not been abolished to this day. When it comes to the end of the year in the lunar calendar, the general public will use Yuánbǎo (Ingot) tea to ask for lucky money. If you visit relatives or tea houses and taverns at that time, you will have to spend a few cents.</p>
<p>Shanghai is originally a prosperous city. Because it is prosperous, all expenses are more expensive than elsewhere. When it comes to the end of the year in the abolished calendar; if you step into a bathhouse, and this bathhouse is one you usually go to, the waiter will smile and bring you a yellow basket of oranges and a sachet of olives, and in addition to a pot of tea, there will also be a plate of oranges and olives. After bathing, when you are about to leave, if you want to take the oranges and olives with you, you will have to reward them with a five-yuan bill, even if you don't take the oranges and olives, reward</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>them with one yuan for the waiter, one yuan for the back rubbing, and one yuan for the tea. These waiters will still not be happy and give you a dirty look. It is really wrong to spend money to buy anger.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, in addition to bathhouses, the waiters in tea houses also have this set of tricks at the end of the year. If you are a regular tea customer, then at the end of the year, you will also be asked to spend two or three yuan on Yuánbǎo (Ingot) tea money. Therefore, those who run around in tea houses, taverns, and bathhouses will have to spend some extra expenses at the end of the year.</p>
<p>Leaving Shanghai, let's talk about our countryside. Yuánbǎo (Ingot) tea in tea houses has always existed, but the prices are vastly different from the past. In the past, in rural tea houses, a pot of Yuánbǎo (Ingot) tea had a total of ten olives. You only had to give them one or two hundred cash, and four hundred cash was already very generous, but now it costs four or eight cents. In more upscale tea houses, where literati and elegant people frequent, what used to cost a few cents now costs one or two yuan. The value of Yuánbǎo (Ingot) tea has also increased with prices.</p>
<p>Speaking from our countryside to the cities, recently, my hometown of Songjiang has also imitated the methods of Shanghai. Originally, Yuánbǎo (Ingot) tea had nothing but ten olives, but now it also adds a yellow basket of oranges and a sachet of olives. If you are a regular tea customer, these two gifts will cost you two or three yuan. There is obviously a different color between the city and the countryside.</p>
<p>During the New Year, if you go to the home of relatives, the maids will also send you a bowl of Yuánbǎo (Ingot) tea. When you leave, if you are polite, you will have to spend forty cents. If you go there often, you will have to spend one yuan. As for our countryside, it is probably twenty cents, and forty cents is already very generous. In the eyes of the maids, the Shanghai maids think twenty or forty cents is very little, but the rural maids think it is very important. The difference in life results in them having different perspectives on money.</p>
<p>Why can olives be used as Yuánbǎo (Ingots)? Why can olive tea be called Yuánbǎo (Ingot) tea? I can never solve this riddle. The general waiters and maids are just using olives as a tool to ask for lucky money. At the end of the year, they use olives to say good words, but they can get an unexpected income. And the general public also regards Yuánbǎo (Ingot) tea as a good omen. Eating Yuánbǎo (Ingot) tea can bring wealth and prosperity into the house, so they are also willing to spend a few cents. As for those waiters and maids, I think they are always hoping that every day of the year is the first day of the new year, so that they can get extra money every day.</p>

<p>— Dan Sheng</p>
<p>(1) Treasure Hunters</p>
<p>Loring believed that this premonition should not be ignored, as he had dreamed three times of many valuable things hidden in his room.</p>
<p>"You're right, Loring," his wife said. "We should search around."</p>
<p>That night, they spent a lot of time tapping on the walls, looking for hollow spots. Finally, they actually found one. After some hammering and chiseling, with skillful use, Loring found that he had succeeded. After removing several bricks, what was hidden inside was exactly what he had seen in his dreams. Rows of silverware were just waiting for them to move.</p>
<p>How fiercely they stared at his wart-like discovery! But as they were discussing what to do with the proceeds from selling these treasures, the doorbell rang loudly, and the neighbor next door jumped in. "What's the matter with you, breaking through the wall into my dining room's cupboard?" he said, panting.</p>
<p>(2) Rescue</p>
<p>The house was already on fire, and the firefighters were working hard to put it out.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a woman ran up to a firefighter.</p>
<p>"Ah!" she cried, "Save me!" She pointed to the window. The firefighter immediately rushed into the house as fast as he could.</p>
<p>"How many days has it been?" an onlooker asked her.</p>
<p>"Only a month!" the woman replied sadly. "Look at him!"—as the firefighter was coming back—"He didn't get it!"</p>
<p>The firefighter walked over and said,</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I couldn't find the child."</p>
<p>"Child?" the woman exclaimed. "Who said anything about a child!"</p>
<p>"Then... what is this?"</p>
<p>"This is my foot... my bicycle!" she sobbed. "I've only had it for a month."</p>
<p>(3) Model Youth</p>
<p>An officious old man said to a woman in the train compartment, "Do you have any children?"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir—a son."</p>
<p>"Good fortune! Does he smoke?"</p>
<p>"No, he has never touched a cigarette."</p>
<p>"Even better, madam, smoking is poisonous. Does he like to gamble?"</p>
<p>"He has never gambled."</p>
<p>"Then I must congratulate you. Does he come home late at night?"</p>
<p>"Never. He goes to bed to sleep after dinner."</p>
<p>"He is truly a model youth. How old is he?"</p>
<p>"Seven months so far."</p>
<p>(4) Misunderstanding</p>
<p>There was a great commotion on deck, with sounds of running back and forth, followed by a grating machine noise. The engine seemed to be stopping. A timid passenger hurriedly rushed out of the cabin and bumped into the shipowner.</p>
<p>"What happened?" he asked, gasping.</p>
<p>"Just in case," the shipowner said solemnly.</p>
<p>"The... life preservers, where are they?"</p>
<p>"Those are useless to you now," the shipowner said. "From now on, you have to defend yourself, because we have already done our duty."</p>
<p>He called the timid passenger to the side of the cabin and said,</p>
<p>"Now you see, everyone is taking care of themselves."</p>
<p>The timid man covered his eyes with both hands and trembled.</p>
<p>"No, no," he cried, "Tell me what's going on!"</p>
<p>"We've entered the port," the shipowner said.</p>

<p>— Qun</p>
<p>The wind was blowing hard, and snowflakes were dancing in the air. No people were seen on the muddy path. Three or five rickshaws were quietly parked in front of a row of thatched huts. The scene was extremely desolate. If a poet seeking plum blossoms in the snow were present, he would certainly be able to write a refined and detached poem. However, this kind of scenery strictly belongs to laborers who only know how to earn money to support their families. Counting along the path, the door of the fifth thatched hut was half-open, as if waiting for someone to arrive. Sure enough, a figure came walking at the end of the path. Judging from the slanted posture of his walk, one could tell that he was eager to hurry on his way, but was also careful not to fall due to carelessness.</p>
<p>The figure gradually approached, and it was a small-footed woman, carrying a package of things in her hand. Her tattered cotton clothes were completely covered in snowflakes. She seemed unaware of the cold air of the wind and snow, and just kept her head down, running along the path and rushing into the half-open door.</p>
<p>In the corner of the room was a small bed, where a patient was sleeping, moaning incessantly, seemingly unable to withstand the attack of some kind of pain. The small-footed woman walked up to the bed and gently stroked the patient's forehead with her palm to gauge the patient's temperature. The patient was still moaning and did not notice that there was another person in the room. When the small-footed woman took her hand away from the patient, her pair of bitter eyebrows were deeply furrowed, and she shook her head, revealing a helpless situation; but she still disassembled the package of medicine she had bought after running several miles and placed it in an earthenware pot, lit a coal briquette stove, and slowly simmered it. She moved a broken stool close to the coal stove and casually picked up a man's tattered garment to mend. At this time, she felt cold again, her fingers were already stiff, and she had no choice but to toss the tattered garment aside and repeatedly warm her hands with the rising steam from the medicine pot; but from time to time she ran to the bedside to press the patient's forehead, her face always filled with a bitter expression of astonishment.</p>
<p>She thought that her husband had been sick for seven days. For families like theirs, there would be no food to eat if they didn't work for even one day. Fortunately, the two of them were frugal and still had a few extra dollars, preparing to thank the gods at the end of the year. The first time, they sent him to that charity hospital for treatment. Although the registration fee was only twenty cents, the cost of medicine was more than one yuan. After the second visit, her husband was unable to get out of bed. Every day, she ran several miles, relying on verbal reports to the doctor to prescribe a prescription. After taking the medicine, he still didn't get better. The few dollars they had for thanking the gods at the end of the year were naturally used up. What about life from now on?…</p>
<p>As she thought, the medicinal liquid in the medicine pot overflowed in a burst of anger. She hurriedly strained it into an earthenware bowl and carried it to the bedside.</p>
<p>Letters</p>
<p>Mr. Lüshuang, I have read the "Manufacturing Method of Artificial Ivory" in the Shanghai Daily Supplemental Edition and have done one experiment. Because I do not know the following questions, I have not succeeded. I very much hope that you will give guidance.</p>
<p>(1) Where to buy milk casein?</p>
<p>(2) What is the composition ratio of various raw materials?</p>
<p>(3) Is the original color yellow before adding color?</p>
<p>(4) Are there any reference books on the manufacturing method of artificial ivory? Please provide the title and place of publication. If you reply, please send it to Chen Kuihe, Kai Luan Sales Office, No. 6 Sichuan Road, and please also indicate your address.</p>

<p>Editor: Since you introduced us, we have met several times. It is true that we have become good friends at first sight, and we regret not meeting sooner. Now we have become close friends. Because we each have our own occupations, there are very few opportunities to meet; however, we exchange letters frequently. Questioning, discussing, and researching have been almost uninterrupted. Unknowingly, we have gained a lot of solutions and joy.</p>
<p>As the ancient saying goes, "Studying alone without friends leads to shallowness and ignorance." As young shop assistants, the friends we make throughout the year are often few. Some have disparate social statuses and keep people at a distance, while others have different ideas, and their words are dull. There are really not many who seek to improve each other in learning and morality. Although we two can be called "friends in righteousness," the intelligence of two people is ultimately limited; therefore, the achievement in the future can be imagined to be small. At the same time, thinking of the young shop assistants with correct thinking and rich knowledge, there are certainly not a few who feel the same sigh of "difficulty in finding friends."</p>
<p>After repeated discussions, we plan to initiate the organization of a "Mutual Aid Correspondence Society." The purpose is to connect a group of young people in the industrial and commercial sectors who aspire to progress, to encourage each other in order to improve their own learning and morality; at the same time, to use "collective power" to struggle against the evil society and to seek the liberation of a group of oppressed comrades. We know that shop assistants generally do not have free time, so we avoid time-consuming "meetings" and use correspondence to discuss issues. As for the detailed regulations, the number of members will be decided after mutual discussion when there are more members.</p>
<p>Although our abilities are very limited, we are confident that this motive will not be completely misguided. Editor, please publish this letter publicly in your column as the origin of organizing this organization. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Please give our regards. Chen Ruren (Tian Tai Chang Hang, No. 6 Hong Fu Xing, North Henan Road)</p>
<p>Hong Mingchang (Qun Yi Bookstore, No. 128 Qipan Street)</p>
<p>Editor's note: Since this column repeatedly advocated "Young people should organize groups," several groups such as the "Academic Research Society" have been established; however, the number of people joining has never been very enthusiastic. Examining the reason, it is probably because there is too much time for meetings... Shop assistants are unable to join because of inconvenience in commuting or because of store regulations. Chen and Hong, in view of this, came up with the idea of ​​using correspondence to solve this difficulty, and in the future, there is no doubt that those who join will be enthusiastic. However, in everything in the world, there are advantages and disadvantages; the method of communication can certainly allow general shop assistants who cannot leave the store to have the possibility of joining. However, in the future, when there are more members, the introduction of a question will inevitably require writing many letters, sending them to each member, and asking for opinions, wouldn't this become another difficult problem? Therefore, we believe that a regular publication should be published, with all questions and answers included; on the one hand, it can avoid the procedure of writing many letters, and at the same time, it can allow a group of people to see the conclusions of the answers. I wonder what Chen and Hong think?</p>

<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>(4) Out of Sight, Out of Mind</p>
<p>Open your eyes and look... the many women with greasy hair and powdered faces, wearing silk and satin, who come and go on the street. What do they live on? To be frank, they are nothing more than machines for venting lust! Observe them carefully... generally, women with more attractive faces live a relatively better life. Women sitting in cars and wearing diamonds are rarely ugly. Limbs and facial features are women's capital. As long as they are endowed with a moving feature, they can eat inexhaustibly for a lifetime.</p>
<p>Women use their appearance and sexuality to win men's hearts and to gamble for a lifetime of happiness. In their youth, they occasionally conceive and give birth to children because of selling their sexuality. Then, when they are old and can no longer provide an outlet for lust, they can rely on their sons to live. Therefore, women's desire to give birth is always more urgent than that of men. After women pass forty, the ugly appearance of wrinkled skin and white hair gradually emerges. The power to maintain men's love has completely disappeared, and if they have no children under their knees, there is no hope for the future. Life at this point is absolutely boring!</p>
<p>Mrs. Xia had reached this point! She thought that in her youth, she had also spent a sweet life with her husband. Now, seeing him infatuated with a young enchantress, leaving herself aside without paying attention, how could she not be angry? She accumulated depression in her heart day by day, and a gas embryo accumulated in her stomach. As long as the stomach pain occurred, it would affect the gas embryo, which would rise straight up, pressing tightly against her chest, making it difficult to breathe. Life was in between breaths.</p>
<p>When she first became ill, Zhongnan was also very alarmed... Later, it occurred every ten days to half a month. As the saying goes, "There are no filial sons when one is ill for a long time," and it became commonplace. When he received news of her illness, Zhongnan only ordered someone to ask the doctor to give her a pain-relieving anesthetic injection. He excused himself by saying that he had something to do, and he was unwilling to come to her bedside to say even a few perfunctory words of comfort. Therefore, her illness became more and more serious.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she had a close maid named Ali by her side, who often used words to comfort her and advised her, "Rather than looking at their faces outside, it is better to go back to your hometown to enjoy a few years of leisure and gain peace of mind."</p>
<p>Mrs. Xia said, "How could I not know to go back and enjoy happiness? But when people talk about it, those who understand will know that I am being humble, and those who don't understand will say that I am afraid of her. Besides... after I leave, letting her take over as the mistress, I am also not very willing."</p>
<p>"Madam, you can come back after you have recovered at home."</p>
<p>"The more I think about it at home, the angrier I get, and the harder it is for the problem to get better."</p>
<p>"Out of sight, out of mind! It's better to be clear than to stare and get angry every day."</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Pudovkin (Pudovgin B.E.)</p>
<p>Pudovkin was born in 1893 and graduated from Moscow University. In 1914, he was still a painter. He did not begin his film career until 1920.</p>
<p>Pudovkin is more diligent and more engaged in scientific research in the film industry than Eisenstein. He believes in inspiration and also relies on method. Some say that Eisenstein's films are like shouts, while Pudovkin's works are like songs.</p>
<p>Pudovkin often produces a kind of vivid power due to the appropriate selection of the elements of the script, and due to the feeling and concept of human beings. He has a great talent, especially for acting. This can evoke the resonance of the audience and reach the highest peak of expression in "Mother" and "The End of St. Petersburg."</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, he makes films with a strict scientific spirit. In addition, he has a natural musical intelligence, so a pure emotion often gushes out in his works. He strives to make the film's composition close to musical composition. He fully understands that in film as in music, movement arises from the expression of images. The rhythm that is organized by its movement is generated by the sequence of images and the duration of images. Therefore, he believes that the importance of rhythm lies in making its effect completely opposite to that of ordinary spatial art, and making the audience's mental function one with the film.</p>
<p>In his work "The End of St. Petersburg," he initially firmly grasps three themes. These three themes are relative and begin to struggle with the same strength, but after the inevitable development, the first two themes are linked together, and the third finally triumphs. The victor is the revolution.</p>
<p>Pudovkin's direction of actors' performances is incredibly appropriate and scientific. This science is difficult to define easily. Of course, this is also his greatness.</p>
<p>Under his own careful management, Pudovkin is often able to develop himself and express himself. This is the point of failure for other people, but for Pudovkin, it is the reason for success. However, he has only one weakness, and that is that he overbelieves in the film's composition and his own knowledge and is unwilling to trust the camera. This is the opposite of Eisenstein. However, Pudovkin's inspiration is truly rich, and all expressions and emotions often come from this inspiration.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e249">(1) Flower of Freedom <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Su Yi</p>
<p>Zheng Zhengqiu's film "Flower of Freedom" has been released at the Central Theater. The script is taken from the story of Yuan Shikai claiming the title of Emperor and Cai E escaping from Beijing to start an uprising in Yunnan. Zhengqiu is a drama expert who is good at singing patriotic tunes, so it seems that he has fully applied his lifelong drama style to the silver screen! He has a style that can arouse emotions in the popular, which can naturally arouse the praise of the audience. "Flower of Freedom" can be regarded as a successful work of the Star Film Company, and it is also a successful work of Zhengqiu.</p>
<p>In terms of light, the whole film is clear and balanced. There are one or two dim fragments, which cannot be regarded as a big flaw. In terms of pronunciation, although it is a mix of southern and northern accents, it can still be heard clearly. There are one or two places where the actors seem to be reading the script dead, looking like they are reciting textbooks, but it does not make people feel annoying. The plot of the whole film is very compact and has the effect of concentrating the audience's attention. These points can be said to be the achievements of the director, photographer, and sound engineer.</p>
<p>As for the actors, Hu Die can be regarded as a successful role. She plays the female detective Jin Yihong, vividly showing a smart, clever, sociable, and not-evil-hearted woman. She sets up a beauty trap to flatter General Chen Gongyue, from capturing Chen to releasing Chen. All kinds of contradictory emotions such as joy, anger, sorrow, happiness, shrew, compassion, crying, and laughing are like a tide, stirring endlessly on her face, chest, and the posture of her whole body. Hu Die is able to put in so much hard work and will be very promising in the future. Other roles, such as Zheng Xiaoqiu, who plays Lin Daping, depicts a pure and brave patriotic young soldier, who is wonderfully sincere. Sitting silently and blowing the flute, sighing and singing long songs, the heroic indignation has been stained with the essence of Zhengqiu's drama. Gong Jianong, who plays Chen Gongyue, pretends to be deaf and feigns illness and specializes in playing cunning supporting roles. However, Xia Peizhen, who plays General Chen's wife, is too rigid, which is a bit of a flaw.</p>
<p>In short, this kind of national film that is reasonable and affectionate is better than the recent crudely made imported films, and it is also better than the unreasonable national "Western Flowers" films. "Flower of Freedom" can be regarded as a national film worth watching.</p>
<h3 id="e250">(2) Nymph Errant (Ronny) <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>This can really be regarded as a great contribution of Ufa Company. For two hours on the New Light screen, Ponny's performance was constantly praised in the dark. Although we have always been very alienated from a large group of European stars, a good impression will never be obliterated. From the story, of course, this is an ordinary comedy, but it is an unusual film. The director's technique is very commendable. Other things such as photography are also perfect. Of course, the most exciting thing is the performance. Marc Dantzer, who plays the prince, is a pure continental-style young man. Although he is not a handsome man, he is very likable. The woman Kate De Nagy is round and jade-like, and her singing can be compared with MacDonald. None of the supporting roles are top-notch. Maybe this play is a bit trivial, because a prince who is so obsessed with the theater is too fatuous; and people who usually play with women with money, such an ending, seems unfinished. But we don't care about anything, it is transcendent in art. All the singing, dancing, and beautiful music give us unparalleled pleasure. I believe that Ufa will definitely sell well in China from this film. One more thing must be stated, it is all in French. However, its center is maintained in singing and dancing, so French will feel more novel and interesting to us, and the film has English translations (every line has it), so people who know nothing about French will not reduce the interest in watching this film.</p>
<h3 id="e251">(3) Living God of Wealth (If I Had a Million) <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Ai</p>
<p>The Living God of Wealth, which is shown simultaneously in Guanglu Lanxin, is more like seven segments pieced together than a movie. It tells the story of a rich man who, when he is critically ill, uses a novel method to distribute a huge amount of inheritance to several unfamiliar citizens. In the film, we see seven different people, each of whom gets one million US dollars out of thin air. Different results occur in different environments, and then they are divided into seven unrelated segments.</p>
<p>The reflection on the screen at the end can also be regarded as a segment. A poor woman in an old people's home gets a check, and she can use this huge amount of money to organize the most perfect old people's home and create a place for the general public. And she herself also becomes a close friend with that rich man. And the rich man is no longer sick. "If I had a million" certainly cannot become a reality, but the wonderful organization is worthy of being the crystallization of the collaboration of seven directors such as Paramount and Lubitsch. Small insertions and the technology of the film cannot be done by any one director, because it is too exquisite. There are more than 20 famous stars, but each person only makes a short segment, such as Jia Zuo Kebo, who only plays one of the three sailors. I can only say that everyone is very good and very responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e252">(4) "Happiness Arrives" Pack up Your Troubles <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Xin</p>
<p>This pair of stars｜Laurel and Hardy｜'s works, to say a Shanghai word, are always "bloody," and more than half of them are hard slapstick. This time, the "Happiness Arrives" in Cathay is really a timely and psychological film. Therefore, there is a lot of commotion, and everyone is going to see this "Happiness Arrives." The plot is about the two of them being forced to join the army, but unintentionally making meritorious service and being released. Then, they meddle in other people's business and look for the grandparents of a friend's child in the army, encountering all kinds of difficulties, only to meet them unintentionally. In these two unintentional good fortunes and short abilities, countless jokes are created. Originally, his achievements in the two films are almost the same, but there is no new progress.</p>
<p>Although slapstick films are more than half unreasonable, there are still two shallow allegories in this script. The first is the American people's hatred for joining the army, expressing the general psychology of war. The second is that many things cannot be forced, so people who are blind and blindly pursue them should be vigilant.</p>
<p>I think that many people think that after watching this film, they didn't laugh much. From the title of the play, they get a good omen. I think that going to laugh for two hours is not a loss for the price you paid.</p>

<p>It is reported that Ms. Yang Liuqing, who was accidentally shot and killed while acting in the film "Lone Army," had been out of touch with her family for three years and had not returned to her hometown. After Ms. Yang's death, the Da Zhong Company found the residence of her parents in Ms. Yang's luggage and sent three telegrams urging them to come to Suzhou to take care of everything. As a result, her mother came to Suzhou. However, regarding the issue of her afterlife, Ms. Yang's mother said that this matter must be negotiated directly with her father.</p>
<p>Now that the film is about to be completed, the negotiation issue must be resolved first. Therefore, last week, representatives were sent to Hangzhou to handle the matter, but they did not get anything. The second negotiation was held a few days ago. As a result, a cash compensation of 3,000 was set as the minimum amount. The company was satisfied and signed a contract to settle the matter. However, it is heard that there is still a clause in the contract that stipulates that a certain percentage of the business income will be taken out as a supplementary condition, which the company also recognized.

<p>They were talking about the pending marriage issue and their going to Canada together, but Sydney felt they might not be able to go before her mother and Gray got married.</p>
<p>"They will hold the wedding in the New Year, right?" Kit asked hopefully.</p>
<p>"Probably, Kit; do you think we will still love each other in Canada! People say that places and environments are enough to change love." She said with a half-smile.</p>
<p>"What place, what environment can change my love for you, Pei?" Kit's eyes showed his deep love for this beautiful young lady. He put his hand into his pocket and took out a ring box. "Look, Sydney, I brought this ring for you. You will soon be the fifth-generation bride in my family to wear it."</p>
<p>"Kit, your mother's engagement ring!"</p>
<p>Sydney was numb in his arms, everything she had hoped for had now come true.</p>
<p>At that time, the carolers were playing music for many guests. Margaret, Gray, and Aunt Hester were all standing near their windows, admiring the beautiful singing. The lead singer suddenly said to Margaret, "Mrs. Fairfield, we would like to sing a special hymn for you and Mr. Gray."</p>
<p>Aunt Hester's face became stern when they associated Gray's name with Margaret, but Margaret smiled and asked them what they wanted to sing.</p>
<p>"If you like, Mrs. Fairfield, we will sing "God Bless the Master of this House | God Also Bless the Mistress of this House |""</p>
<p>Margaret was very happy, and seemed a little shy.</p>
<p>Their rhythmic singing aroused Aunt Hester's reaction. Unable to restrain herself and忍忍 to wait until the singing was over, she took Margaret away from the crowd.</p>
<p>"Margaret! How could you allow them to sing that hymn? Hilary is the master of this house, no one else, only your husband Hilary!"</p>
<p>The next day, Christmas morning, the table was set as usual for three people's breakfast. Aunt Hester and Margaret were sitting and eating, and Sydney walked in, cheerfully exclaiming, "Merry Christmas to you!"</p>
<p>Aunt Hester interjected, "Thank you for my calling card case, Sydney."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's a cigarette case, dear Aunt. If you give me another prayer book this year, we'll have plenty of"</p>
<p>She unwrapped the package placed on her left, and continued, "Hey, I expected it. Thank you very much, Aunt. Another prayer book for me!"</p>
<p>"Have you taught your daughter to be so rude to me, Margaret?" Aunt Hester was furious.</p>
<p>"Sydney!" Margaret warned her.</p>
<p>"Does she think I'm as easy to control as you are?"</p>
<p>Margaret again feigned a reprimand, "Not necessarily, dear."</p>
<p>"Don't you think it was she who made you suffer since you divorced your father? Isn't it she who is preventing you from marrying Gray?"</p>
