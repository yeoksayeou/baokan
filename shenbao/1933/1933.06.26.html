<p>時評</p>
<h3>水災之善後處置</h3>
<p>明</p>
<p>我國水患。近二千餘年來爲害最烈者。莫如黃河。其潰决地域。多在洛陽以至山東。每逢夏季沿河居民。類都惴惴不安。滿淸初葉。設河道總督以專管河工。而仍無補於水患。迄乎近今。黃河水患匪特並未消除。其汜濫較前尤甚。且鄭州沿河而東。而開封·而考城以至山東之東阿·長淸·齊河等沿河諸地。旣不·能得灌漑之利。反常受水災之威脅。以故開封附近區域。已有多種植物不能在彼種殖。大有化爲沙漠之險象。吾人細究現勢。追察往古。黃河流域原爲我國文明之中心區域。中國民族。曾得黃河之種笙利益。何以衰頽如此。其根本原因河在。吾人姑置政治上之因素不論。而祇就經濟上原因言之。人事之摧殘爲第一。譬如治水工作。四千餘年來。除大禹實行疏濬而外。上焉者力主堵塞。惟知加高堤防以禦水於是堤防愈高。水勢愈緩如封之黃河河身。且高於城垣一丈有奇。然而堤防之增築人仍與年俱加。故五十年以至七十年間。必發生一次大水患。其下焉者專圖數衍目前。更不足道矣。近來我國政治重心。以國都南移而遷至長江流域。即經濟主流亦轉移於長江。而水患亦若隨政治經濟而同至長江。前年之巨大水災。幾遍長江各省。農村元氣。迄猶未復。今年僅在黃梅時節。尙非眞正發水期間。漢口水標。已達四十七尺。爲近百年來所未有之現象。倘由此日漲不已。則江漢各地。勢將盡成澤國。今後農民又將何以生活耶。言救災者第一着重救水患次爲修理堤防。又次爲振濟難民。此等政策。誠爲當前之急務。然祇能救濟於一時。并非根本解决之道。現在之長江上遊江身。皆爲石底。不同於黃河多帶泥沙。設使任其自然發展。而不思疏濬。沿江各地。又復修築堤壩。以開闢田畝。大之如洞庭鄱。陽小之如洪湖曹湖以至湋源　湖等。類多以人工限制其瀦蓄之本職。從事於田疇之開闢。而不注意於疏濬。則正蹈黃河以前之故轍。堤防之束縛愈緊。江水之流行愈艱。一旦雨量稍多。遇剩之水。即無處消納。於是汎濫橫溢。衝堤潰防。而到處皆成洪水矣。</p>
<p>現在災象已成。武漢三　。幾成澤國。臨時救濟之道。固不容稍緩。然若爲根本救濟計不當僅注意於建築新堤。而當注意於揚子江之積極疏濬·蓋建築新堤之效果。祇能得暫時若干年之平安。疏濬則爲根本消弭災害。不過茲事體大。必須長久之日月。遠大之計劃。堅毅不拔之耐苦精神。乃克舉之·慛爲國家百年大計。應不惜此巨大之犧牲。以奠定將來之基礎。長江源流長遠。宜昌以下。江流遲緩。河床旣易淤塞。兩岸成爲冲積地。尤易釀成水災。築堤防水之法。已不宜續用而潴水湖沼。更不可少。故於疏濬長江。除本身工作而外。凡洞庭鄱陽曹湖湯家湖等大小湖沼。亦須開挖。務使其能蓄大量一時不能出海之山洪。然後水患方可消彌。否則不待百年。長江又將步黃河之後而爲中國之大害矣。</p>

<h3>赫爾正式聲明</h3>
<p>與羅斯福總統意見不相左</p>
<p>美國計劃與國際合作脗合（倫敦）近來歐洲方面頗信美總統與國務卿赫爾對於經濟會議計畫意見相左、今日赫爾爲　釋此種觀念起見、特發一正式聲明聲、稱此種觀念足以阻止完全實現會議之希望、目下國際合作之程序與美國減少失業　提高物價之國内計畫、並無不能脗合这處此時一再盛傳代表團内部　見　　之說、大足以阻礙會議之進步、今夫提高物價以保障經濟利益、乃各國所必要者、故不問其採用何種改善狀况之計畫、凡欲增高物價與在貿易上國際合作者、皆當予以最完滿之贊助各國提高物價、或將採用不同計畫、苟其計畫係屬健全、則當受一般之贊助、國際間合作程度、當擴充至調和此種計畫、俾可共同努力、以策貿易之復興、赫爾嗣乃答復報紙可載、渠因與總統衝突頗甚、意欲辭職之說、謂美國提出會議之關稅提議、其中措辭悉係會議開幕前在華盛頓所擬定、此間與華盛頓種種經過、俱未有足以變更此種局面者、美代表團信外傅美總統與國務卿意見相左之、說由於美政府前旣將安定幣價問題列入會議討論事項之内、後又拒絕加入安定幣價臨時協定而起云、（二十四日國民電）</p>
<h3>法國態度堅决</h3>
<p>對大會前途悲觀</p>
<p>（巴黎）法財長龐萊曾於星期五日報告關於世界經濟大會進行情形、内有法政府對於世界經濟大會之態度、一言以蔽之曰、如各種協定僅可於匯兌穩定後發生效力、則法國準備在經濟範圍内繼續合作等語、當局雖有文告聲明内閣會議一致贊同龐氏之言、但聞法政府對於大會之結果、殊不抱樂觀、法政府仍將力主英鎊美元之穩定、蓋視此爲大會一切建設之唯一基礎也、法國之退出大會、固不成問題、惟國内一般人士則以爲大會之繼續會議、徒費光陰耳、衆院中之反對黨曾提出動議主張法政府應申請大會延會至非金本位圜幣已確切穩定而後已、此項動議似不致成立、惟在表露姿勢上殊有關係也、（二十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>意輿論亦悲觀</h3>
<p>麥唐納樂觀不符事實</p>
<p>（羅馬）意大利輿論對於倫敦經濟會議希望絕少、咸視其不能得到實用之結果、　在經濟會議開幕之前一月、意大利人士已頗懷疑、謂如此會議、聚六十餘國代表於一堂、發言盈庭焉能奏效、嗣四强條約簽訂、乃有人以爲倫敦會議所抱之精神與之相同、或者經濟會議因該約之成立而得收效、亦未可知、意大利人士又謂近日美國所取之態度、實令人大爲失望『斯丹巴』報談及英首相麥唐納最近發表關於經濟會議之宣言、謂此宣言不啻一種『樂觀之注射、此不過表示麥唐納之善於樂觀而已、與事實眞相固不相合也、』同一報紙又謂經濟會議所設之小組委員會名目繁多、令人無從分辨、該會不得不將各種委員會列一圖解、以備新聞記者之參考云、又有數報發表一種消息、頗爲得意、略謂美國之消極態度、將促成區歐洲各國經濟上之結合、意大利對於此種結合、僅於萬不得已時始承認之、然亦不願出而反對也、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德拒絕俄抗議</h3>

<p>奥全國千餘山頭舉火</p>
<p>反希特勒運動大示威</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十五日維也納電據加林蒂地方所傳消息似屬可靠、謂奥國希特勒派活嚴份子决定另有舉動、其目的在使國社黨在奥國得到勝利任、何代價均所不惜、國社黨委員會將設在匃德邊境、志在擾亂秩序、及實施恐怖主義、上星期六林資地方發現飛機、即係國社黨新舉動之發端云、</p>
<p>哈瓦斯社二十五日維也納電奥國對于希特勒黨之活動加以抵抗、博得人民多數之同情、此間有人聲稱、國社黨間題可在内部解决、倘奥國國社黨不得到外國之援助則、彼等勢必完全失敗、統觀全局此次國社黨这重新進攻、一切均在德國境内預備、並得德國國社黨之公開協助、有人且謂希特勒本人、曾稱對于奥國國社黨之運動與以充分援助、此言曾由巴維耶内務部長口中國說出僧城現成爲國社黨之大本營、專爲指揮對、奥國之動作上星期六、林茲地方之飛機、即係國社黨再度進攻之發端、至國社黨捲土重來、將在何處活動、尙難確定大約將在德奥邊界一帶、集中其力量、按最近陶爾斐斯曾發表宣言、表示决心、將保衛奥國以防國社黨之進攻、但此項宣言之用意此間認爲不能解作、遇有破壞條約時、奥國將訴諸任何方式之外援、因奥國無論如何、總屬日耳曼民族之國家、凡一切視爲背叛日耳曼民族利益之行動、奥國均不欲輕易出之、但觀察將來形勢、德奥見解日趨睽異、勢必向國際方面提出、此乃事勢發展使然、而爲奥國所不能阻止者也、『聯邦郵報』謂德國政府領袖所採取之政策、欲將奥國國社黨改變成爲柏林國社黨之支部、因此德功政府領袖對於奥國國社黨一切行動、均應負責云、又謂目前德國所冒之危險甚爲鉅大、其性質之嚴重蓋已越出兩國爭議之範圍云路透二十四日維也納電奥國國家社會黨領袖柏羅克志駕飛機在林資擲下傳單、解除奥國國社黨職員之任務、此舉顯圖使國社黨黨員、於將來奥國發生暴動時有卸罪地步、傳單中且載有德總理希特勒將向奥政府挑戰並隱含煽亂之文字、奥國特於今夜在人國千餘大小山頭舉火以答之、此爲奥總理杜爾夫斯豫、示及國社黨計畫中愛國大示威之一部分、杜氏在林資演說、謂奥政府决不爲威嚇之函所動、奥人準備保衛祖國至流其最後一滴之血云、維也納國社黨領袖佛洛恩菲爾德今日在赴意途中之某村被阻、押回維也納已国逮捕、</p>

<h3>德胡根培辭職</h3>
<p>路透廿四柏林電德經濟部長胡根培刻已謂出辭呈、但興登堡總統尙未接受、路透二十四日柏林電胡根培因辭職事上書興登堡總統、謂三月二十三日國會所通過之法案、許國社黨在德轼政府中有全權者、今隨渠之辭職而失效力、因此種權力、僅以目瓣内閣之禱命爲限也云但國社黨方面則謂目前内閣係以希特勒名義著聞、故胡根培之退出希特勒内閣、並不碍及内閣本身之地位云、</p>
<h3>但澤希特勒化</h3>

<h3>歐局新醞釀</h3>
<p>捷克外長活動</p>
<p>意國方面重視</p>
<p>哈瓦斯二十五日羅馬電捷克外長彭納斯在倫敦巴黎兩地與英法政府曾商一事、意國報紙雖不加以評論、然已引起意國方面之大注目、且因彭納斯與經濟會議意國代表亦曾經會商、故更爲此間所重視、按諸四强公約簽約前後之談話、則捷克對於中歐改造問題之主張、並未與意國對於此問題之主張、澈底衝突在四强公約舉行草簽之前、彭納斯曾經數次發表重要演說、意國對於此等演說最爲注意者、即其妥協熊度意國雖不能採納彭納斯之主張、但頗希望覓得能使各方面滿意之解决方法、意國各報指出捷克有組織多瑙河諸國同盟之擬議、此則爲意國所不願聞之點、意國深恐其鄰國結成强大之聯盟、故寗願中歐各國互訂雙方條約、以互相聯絡關於此、節意國之主張、似無並未與捷克之主張絕對衝突、此際意國對於小協商三國之政策、各不相同意國對於巨哥斯拉夫取反對態度、對於羅馬尼亞取妥協態度、對於捷克則又期望獲得較善之相互理解云、</p>
<p>國民廿五日巴黎電總理達拉第今日延見捷克外長皮尼士博士、互談政治問題歷時頗久、</p>

<p>羅斯福今日實行</p>
<h3>提高棉價計劃</h3>

<h3>代表訓詞</h3>
<p>市黨部陶百川云、今天日市商會召集第四次會員代表大會兄弟代表市黨部、曾經參加市商會第一第二第三次大會、連今天巳經第四次了、向與各業領袖共參盛會、甚爲榮幸、剛才聽到主席報告中、有一句『本位救國』的新口號、兄弟對於這句話、很表贊同、値得與各位討論一下、所謂『本位救國』這句話、可以說不僅是商人、就是全國任何一個國民、也都要共同努力、作爲一個救國的自救、因爲惟其能夠從本身的地位上、把應該做的事盡心做去得到了圓滿結果、這就足以盡其本位的一個救國責任、談到商人的本位、就應該有二個本位、一個是其自已的商人本位、第二個就是國民本位如果商人但知一個商人本位、而不知有第二個國民本位、這就是彷彿猶太商人一般、祇我認自已的本位而巳、無絲毫的國家思想、民族思想除了自已之外、簡直和沒有國家一様、然而他們終於因之失去國家對於國民的應有保障、吾人知道、凡是國家民對於國家都有參加政治組織、和參加社會組織的機能、關於參國社會組織、不論是農工商學各界、都各有基本位、可以盡其救國的一分責任、現在就國民本们位、最重要的一件工作、就是廢止内戰問题、如果内戰不能廢止、可以說國内的工商業、永遠不會發達、日人侵略的野心、將益加無巳、社會經濟、愈趨於破産窘境、無法補救記得兄弟在這一次總理蒙難紀念會、在某處演說、其時曾經有個人、問我何以我們國内的叛變、要較任何一國爲多呢、我就把這個原因告訴他、第一是吾國固有民族道德的墮落、新的道德未合軌道、舊的巳被屏棄不取、第二是民權問題、國民太沒有政治的智識能力、興趣的緣故第三就日民生問題、國内生産的發達、經濟的崩潰破産、而交互形成了這個不良趨勢、現在吾們是商人、從商人本身能力所及、祇有以發展生産爲一個救國的有效方法、所以吾們從消極方面、說是廢止内戰、積極的便是謀永遠的和平、從上面的結論、可以得到第一個是國民本位、對于政治盡國民責任、廢止内戰的工作、第二個是商人本位、從經濟上盡力提倡國貨、發展生産、這是兄弟對于王主席剛才報告中所得到『本位救國』的一個貢獻、㈡社會局吳恒如云、今日市商會開第四屆會員代表大會兄弟的代表社會局參加、非常榮幸、現在就兄弟所希望的幾點、略爲諸君貢獻、上海是中國最繁盛的區域、亦是全國經濟之重心、舉凡一切事業、均爲各地各處所憑式、尤其是商人的一舉一動、可以代表全國、本市自從去年一二八事變以後、滬民切身所受的痛苦、至深且鉅、其後受災地方、雖由政府逐漸恢復、中間還仗商人的助力、此點當爲政府表示感謝的、在目前世界各國經濟都處於不景氣的時代、我們更其覺得自身的危險、在從前時代、素以地大物博自豪的中國、尙可以拿自已的土産、輸出去向國外換回製成品、勉强維持過去、但是外國因爲科學的發達、本國生産的落後、以致重受外國過剩品大量輸入的影響、考諸每年海關進口報告册、入超則與時俱增出超則無不逐年减低、所謂一個國家可從入超與出超上看出强弱來、吾國旣遭受這個潮流的侵襲、農村經濟、於是破産往往一個農民、終日勤懇、結果還是不得一飽、還有農産品的低落、亦爲造亂之一大原因所以吾們欲成爲一出超國、必須㈠多量生産、㈡維持貨價、㈢杜塞漏巵、而此三點、尤在仰仗政府主持、利用關稅政策來保護、但是我們因外交上或條約上的關係、使政府仍有其無可帮助之原因、所以還是在國民地位、容易盡其責任、努力增加生産、抵制外貨爲國家抵禦列强侵略之助希望商界本諸良心、從這幾點努力做去、化除同業間一切意見、互相聯絡、站在一條戰線、上向外發展、俾國民經濟、可以恢復寛裕、國運前途、實深利賴云云、</p>

<p>經濟恐慌聲中</p>
<h3>兩路營業銳减</h3>
<p>四個月短收一百萬元</p>
<p>京滬滬杭甬兩路管理局、鑒於兩路營業銳减、如民國二十二年自一月份至四月份止、比較民國二十年同月份、京滬路短收銀八十七萬餘元、滬杭甬路减收銀十一萬餘元、兩路合計已埀百萬元、至於京滬路六月份預測須虧短六十萬元、原因爲各業不景氣、農村經濟破產、以致貨運减少、、局長黃伯樵詳細研究設法、力謀補救、如减低絲繭等運價、以謀運輸發達而增收入</p>
<p>天放晴後</p>
<h3>長江區域愼防水漲</h3>
<p>上游因融雪仍高漲未已連日江水大漲、武漢三鎭江、水已與岸齊、堤岸建築較低之處、已有數處潰决、江水若高漲未已則民國二十年大水之災、又將重演、全國經濟委員會已責令江漢工程局負責、分段堵防槍險茲據該會工務處消息、分誌如次、</p>
<h3>努力防災</h3>
<p>武漢以下沿江堤岸、自民國二十年大水後、即增高堤身、俾免大水冲入爲災、堤身最高處爲四十八尺、自五日起霉雨連朝、江漢上流積雪融化、水勢飛漲不已、據最近報告、江水距岸僅六寸左右、堤岸較短之處、已被冲入、目前天雖放晴、但上流高山積、雪因天氣關係、正在融化時期、預測江漢水勢、尙有高漲之可能、本年水勢已高出民國二十年紀錄、若再高漲不已、則能否避免水災、任何人不能預測防水機關、責職所在、自當竭力防禦但地區廣大、工程殊非易易、所幸地方人士、都能協助防禦、故關於工程上之物質供給等、均不感困難、</p>
<h3>下流危急</h3>
<p>長江上流（宜昌以西）高山重重江流遄急、因時届融雪時期、雪水奔騰而下、會灌長江、故中流（自宜昌至漢口）江水暴漲、該段江面極狹、又爲漢水湘江等會合之處、一時不能下瀉、漲勢遂較甚、自漢口武穴以下、則江面廣闊支流較稀、漲勢遂形少殺、倘上流水漲不已、則下流地屬平但堤身較低亦必波及、蕪湖一帶江水業已到岸、、</p>
<h3>分段預防</h3>
<p>江堤建築愈高、則堤内平地益形低窪、設江水日漲不已、得隙冲入、則爲害之烈、必將較甚於前年、蓋江水冲入後、因堤内低窪、不易洩退故也、防務工程、業已劃定地區、分段預防俾不致有顧此失彼之虞也、</p>

<p>申報醫藥週刊上海市近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）  龐京周第五章醫藥之行政第二節醫藥界名稱與團體我們中國向來對於醫者，沒有專門確定的名稱，北方稱大夫先生，南方稱郎中或醫生··還都是客觀的稱呼·醫家自稱，至多冩某醫士，而大部份招牌上，祇冩某某人男婦大小方脈，或什麽科·乃是名字以下緊接着所執何業·使人一望而知，所以沒有另外自稱的必要。後來外國人到華執業，都自稱醫生，中國人習了新醫，也有稱醫生，或稱西醫的，再後來從外國得了學位回來，又拿Ｄｒ·譯爲博士，而自稱某博士·或醫學博士的·也有因所學的醫學用某國學系，遂稱德醫，法醫，美醫的。但是在社會上人們，用對象的眼光來看，却一例稱之謂西醫，或者俗稱呌外國醫生，以别於舊時的郎中大夫，相沿成俗，倒也混過去了。可是後來北京内政部衛生避頗想整理醫界，當言道　··『名不正·则言不順』不得不先將龐雜的醫界定出分門别類的名稱來？於是那時候就定了三項名稱··（甲）凡是國内外正式學校畢業的，擬定爲醫師，這醫師兩字，出於周禮，雖則界說不同，然而足見當時當局對於正名定分，還下過一番思索，不像如今亂帶帽子，弄出什麽古怪的名辽來。（見下）（乙）凡不是學校出身而已用新法爲人治病開業多者，統稱之曰醫生，以示區别。（丙）凡是全用古法切脈開方，以及推拿針炙諸科醫者。統稱之曰醫士。細玩上三項的字義，旣沒有高下軒輊之分，又沒有門户褒眨之意··而北京警廳與内務部衛生司考騐資格，給予證書，仍以呼該項的技術學問爲準·用意至善，立法至公，對於此三項人物的生活事業，並無什麽侵損壓迫·但是後來政局杌揑，衛生司的政績，不能遍及各省，各地尙不能都設立衛生局，以致直到如今，其間政令若斷若續，弄得這一盤散沙，愈難收拾。且說當時政府旣有這種政令，於是遠在上海的醫界，就有一部份正式醫校畢業的醫者，先將市招改爲醫師，隨後來又於民國十四年十一月一日成立了一個醫師公會，那時候海上許多正式醫者，尙以爲此會可有可無，並不踴躍加入，根本不如律師公會的嚴厲，不入會不許出庭，所以懶得换招牌的，還是照舊稱着醫生，西醫，法醫·德醫之類·也不去管他，而且其時上海警察廳初有衛生科，一時尙管不到醫界。租界上呢，工部局始終沒有加以取締·故而無人問信，一直到了民國十五年十一月，淞滬商埠衛生局舉辦醫師登記，遂由非學校畢業的醫者組成了一個中華西醫公會，遙遙與醫師公會對峙，並且當時似乎颇不以醫師公會爲然。好像說醫師公會有些身價自高的態度，其實醫師公會的章程上，入會資格限定學校畢業，也人上述北政府令上的線索可尋，並不是故意排斥他人，如今經我把來源說明，大約西醫公會的諸君也可以自問鹵莽了吧。（此外詳以下政令節）到了十八年七月，國民政府時代，又因醫師公會的進步，而成立全國醫師聯代合會，從此對於衛生行政上醫業保障，多有所建議，可惜環境不良，成績還不能達我們最初的期望。寸口診脈的討論（二）  余霴岫（三）扁鵲的人格和其脈學的價値我說寸口診脈的法兒，是出於難經這部書，這部難經是誰做的呢，就是大名鼎鼎的扁鵲，這位扁鵲先生是江湖醫第一滑頭貨，諸君請讀讀史記的扁鵲倉公傳，就可以曉得他的行醫秘訣。他到了趙國，知道趙國是貴重女人，他就做起婦人科醫生··到了周邦，知道周人愛養老人，他就做起耳聾眼花的醫生來；到了咸陽，知道泰人愛小兒，就做起兒科醫來。這種行爲，從一方面看起來，似乎十八件武藝件件皆能，就一方面看起來，不過迎合社會，及收病人，江湖上一種糊口的滑頭手段，和現在男女大小方脈内外全科的招牌一様就是了。扁鵲　又說道··『特以脈爲名耳，』又說道··『越人之爲方也，不待切脈』，到了末後，太史公說道··『至今天下言脈者，由扁鵲也，』諸君想想，這幾句話是什麽東西？就是，扁鵲的行醫，另外有幾種診察疾病的方法，絲毫用不着診脈，他的診脈，是做作腔調，裝璜門面，完全是欺詐行爲，所以他所著的書，所講的脈象，完全是撒謊造謠，現在天下關於脈的言論，都是從扁鵲一派來的，這就是太史公明明白白告訴人說，現在天下關於脈的言論，都是醫生做作腔調，裝璜門面的欺詐行爲，撒謊造謠，狗屁不如，請國人思最思量，我的話對麽？（四）寸的三部九候分配五藏，不全是扁鵲創造人，進一步說，扁鵲做了難經，創造單診寸口的脈法，雖然已經是狗屁不如，但是還沒有明目張瞻，說那一部是肝脈，那一部是肺脈，虚造寸口地方的三部九候，來分配五藏六府，其第十八難分寸關尺三部，明明說是測候從頭到胸，從膈到臍，從臍到足的病證，並不說左右兩手公做六部，一部候一藏的話，其第四難用呼吸來分候五藏，用浮沈來分候心肺和腎肝，用浮而大散和浮而短𥜎，來分候心肺，用牢而長和按之濡舉指來實，來分候肝腎，第五難用持脈的輕重，來分候五藏，第九難用脈的遲數，來分候藏府，第十五難用弦鈎毛石，來分候肝心肺腎，都不是分左右寸關尺來分候的，第十六難肝脈心脈等的話，也是指鈎弦等而言，並沒有說明是左寸左關的脈，第十八　說『肺脈雖不見，右手當沈伏·』也只深說右手，並不指明右手寸部屬肺，所以單診寸口的法·難經　確實是有的。至於左手寸關尺是心肝腎，右手寸關尺是肺脾命門的話，就是現在貴國醫們所通行的脈法，在難經裏面，完全沒有根據可以找着，諸公可以明白這個腿法，固然不是黃帝岐伯的方術，也不是完全扁鵲的方術請敎國人想一想，我的話對麽？（五）寸口的分部候藏是起於緯書河圖王叔和脈經卷一，兩手六脈所主五藏六府陰陽順逆第七，引用脈法讚的文字說道，『肝心出左·脾肺也右，腎與命門，俱出尺部』這幾句文字，就是現今貴國醫所通用的寸口脈不法，但是隨朝的陽城郡開國公蕭吉所撰的五行大義，引用河圖的文字，完全和脈法讚一様。不過『俱』字換作『並』字就是了，意義總是一様的。據此，可以曉和脈經所引的脈法讚文字，他的外婆家，還是出於河圖，五生大義中引用河圖的文字狠多，吾們可以證實他是兩漢講災異的緯書，就是陰陽五行學說的流派，現在國人已經曉得陰陽五行，是無根據的玄學，我們那貴國醫館，也已經　悟到非放棄玄學不可，非用科學方法來淸理不可。那末河圖所産的這幾句分配五藏脈法，當然也應該在放棄之列，何以貴國醫們把這個巫瞽式，星卜式的老戲法，一句也沒有人敢批評他，懷疑他，和反對他這是什麽緣故呢，老實對諸公說，恐怕就是扁鵲以脈爲名的意思，若把這個診脈的勾當也放棄了，簡直是赤手空拳·那裏還可騙飯喫。要曉得古人說『工欲善　其事，必先利其器』·這個脈法，是我們貴國醫二千年來欺詐行爲的利器·單靠着這點戲法，來欺瞞無知　的愚民，半開化的知識界，和有遺傳性發昏病的時髦人物，所以死也不肯被棄，諸公請透底想一想，可笑不可笑呢。（未完）藥業这眞善美  宋國賓醫藥評論百期紀念專號，余曾爲『醫家之眞善美』文，以明夫醫家之所以爲醫，不僅在其學術要必有眞誠之人格，慈善之心腸，可觀之容止，然後足以行其這而有濟於人，非是者舉不得謂之良醫也。余友周君夢白，以余言醫德，乃亦倡言藥德，曾爲『藥德』一文以實本刋，剴切詳明，鈎深頤隱，其於藥家應守之道德，發揮無餘，余與周君，雖操業有别，而旨趣攸同，舉世滔滔之際，道德淪喪之秋，而吾兩人者獨言人之所不欲言，可爲戆矣。因君高論，啓予深思，不揣淺陋，著爲斯篤質之周君，其亦有以敎我耶？孟子曰，『大人者不失其赤子之心者也，夫赤子云者，言其知識雖幼稚，言其心術則眞誠，故語某小則一赤子之天眞，推其極則古賢哲立功之大本也，懦家之所謂『誠意，』佛家之所謂『眞如』，舉未能出此也，商之爲業，本以不欺爲極則，矧長所謂藥業者，又與他業不同，稍涉欺詐，則有關於人命矣。年來國内藥界，言僞行辯，不可究極，誇張其詞，昻貴其價，甚者假冒倣造，無所不爲，自欺欺人，莫甚於此，故居今之世，而言『藥德』，舍『眞』之外，别無他求，此其一。『善』之爲言，含義有二，謙謙君子，是曰善人，其義一也，；精益求精，俾底盡善，其義二也；以藥家言，凡製一藥，必求其精，而無一毫苟且之心焉，須知藥能救人，爲之不善·亦足以害人，故一藥不能盡善，斯有害於病家，仁者之心，必不出此，蓋慈善觀念，固匪醫家所獨有也。至於交易之際，尤須以</p>

<p>謙忝待人，購者有所詢問，當竭誠以告之，有所疑惑，當娓婉以陳之，夫如是社會人士，乃不致爲舊藥業所迷誤，而賓至如歸也，此其二。『美』有内外之别，言其内，則製造之精良也，言其外，則裝飾之宏麗也，舶來品物之所以暢銷於中土者，大半有賴於外表之美觀，則美之爲用，亦云鉅矣。自國産新藥之聲浪日高，而吾國人自辦之藥廠，亦遂應時而起，其内容如何，則别有論列，至其外表，則多模倣舶來，夫一國有一國之美術，新藥旣云國，正可以中國之美術，爲外表之裝璜，　旣可以自别於外來之貨品，尤可以表現吾國民族固有之精神，惟善　惟美，足以抵制舶來而有餘矣，此共三。余醫也，而言藥，自知不免於疏陋之譏，惟所舉數事，似甚淺鮮，一得之愚，又鳥在其無小補也。科學的達生篇（二十一）  俞松筠㈩㈦床上生活的時間（甲）三個星期在床上産褥中須有二十一天的就床，因爲在此時間，子宮與體力還未充分恢復，决不可無故離床，此時如果常時起立，長時行動，那末，子宮與産道的組織，勢必弛緩，同時，子宮的恢復機能，必起障碍，或竟子宮内面，易患出血。自從妊娠與分娩，歷經疲勞以來，産婦全身浮腫，體内各種臟器，以及子宮周圍等部位，不無損傷，倘無特殊原因，大槪在這三個星期以内，漸漸可以恢復元氣。（乙）六個星期産褥期子宮自起收縮，須在四個星期以後，方可大體復舊，漸次縮小，同時，血液混惡露而排洩，在此時期，最宜入浴，或行局部的洗濯，但離床入浴，須在産褥期末，心身的健康，須俟六個星期，方可完全恢復，産褥期内，對於親友的訪問，日常的家務，均須特别加以限制，尤其嚴禁房事。（丙）床上的禁忌産褥期中，在床上看書縫衣，完全要禁絕，因爲容易惹起眼病，甚至有終身眼患之累，例如眼翳視力衰弱等患，不可不加戒備。産褥中一星期内，會客談話，徒擾産婦的安靜，並易惹起頭痛或體温加高之患，如尚未滿六個星期，切勿任意外出，以防危險。㈩㈧産褥中的食養（甲）飲食的注意産後如無意外的變化，那末，飲食仍從舊日的所好，不必多事變更，祇求易於消化，不逾其量，就很妥善，在産褥初期·進以牛乳鷄蛋米湯薄粥，最爲適宜，口渴可飲已沸的温水，尋常在二星期後，可以恢復常食。牛肉有碍子宮的收縮，其餘肉類，食之可以促進自然的通便，如係自己授乳，應當多吃滋養料豐富的食物，牛乳湯汁，易增乳量，允宜多飲。産婦在産褥期中，每天應需食量，平均計之，大約蛋白質一○○	克，脂肪料五○克，含水炭素三○○以至五○○克。（乙）食物營養的原則食物營養之法，非但對於産褥熱疾患的治療，很關密切，即使非産褥熱的治療，亦當注意，因爲食物所含各種物質，在消化器中，由化學作用，變成種種化合物，吸入血中再由循環作用，流入四肢，以供組織臟器的消耗，而爲維持生活的要素，尤其是受有疾患痛苦的人們，更當注意食物的營養，以謀抵抗病菌之侵略。（丙）急性熱病的食養急性熱病人的食養品，大抵是用粥湯粟粉牛乳蛋白蛋黃肉汁糜粥等物，較爲適宜，但在粥湯中，最好加牛乳卵黃果汁等物之一種，糜粥中加酒鹽或白糖爲善，所有飲料，在已沸之淸水中，加葡萄酒果汁，但須根據下列症候，分别取捨。㈠消化機能，完全消失，或很衰弱時，宜用果汁澱粉糖汁，並在水中，稍加葡萄酒等類。㈡消化機能，受有障碍時，宜用粥湯栗粉中，稍加牛乳，或在肉汁中，稍加蛋黃等物。㈢興奮性飲料，如酒類，宜於急性熱病。（丁）慢性熱病的食養慢性熱病人，須用易於消化食物，因患有此病的消化機能，雖較佳良，但究不十分康强，此種食品，不外下列各種。㈠汁牛乳乳製品牛乳湯乾酷牛酪湯肉醬鷄蛋蛋黃蛋白汁果汁㈡湯栗粉麥粉糜粥麵包豆粉㈢其他酒咖啡食鹽苦扁桃等急性熱病人者，雖这宜多食脂肪，但在慢性熱，反可制止身體蛋白質的消耗，而含水炭素，亦具此功，故宜多進，病人進食的時刻，不能和普通健康人一様，最好一日分五次，例如午前八時十一時，午後一時四時八時，按時分食，除遇病人的習惯，熱度的昇降，稍宜變更外，總以嚴守各時的規則，較爲妥善。忠告專講包醫的醫家  葉植生海上繁華居世界第三，醫家之多，冠於全國，其中有資格，講道德，憑良心，固然多數，但是不學無術專以秘術騙人，包醫害人者，實不乏人。彼輩祇知自已收入豐富，不問病家之預后生死，一入其門，動輒包醫，不察其内外因外原，都以毒目之，爲淋爲梅，槪以六○六注射之，病人有腦病心病腎病，皆不顧也。要之病變無常，遇極微之小恙，常有惡性經過，重篤之病症，時有佳良之轉歸，即以淋病梅毒而論，其毒實屬兩原，故治淋病之藥，不能治梅毒，治梅毒之藥，不能治淋病。再證諸個人臨床所見，淋疾性橫痃，注射六○六，的反促其加劇，軟性下疳亦然，病家不察，往往墮醫者術中，至增加自身之痛苦，雖病家無醫學知識，而醫家應本其本能，憑其道德良心，絕對不能以術欺人，以包醫騙人，以秘方藥誤人，則對人對己，均告無愧矣。『癱癆鼓向膈』新釋（二）  胡嘉言（五）脊髓性麻痺症本病有急性慢性之别，急性以小兒患者最多，故有小兒麻痺之名。初起時與急性傳染病相仿彿，發高熱，譫語，嘔吐，時發猩紅熱性紅疹，全身筋肉痙攣，至熱退醒覺則現運動麻痺。但突然發現麻痺，在事前毫無特殊症象也有的。其麻痺常發現於下肢，因炎症位置之不同，故或爲偏癱，或爲截癱，或爲頸性截癱（兩上肢麻痺），此種情形，在數日後徐徐减退，然此例殊不多，大多數則筋肉瘦削，陷於高度萎縮，其睫反射亦因以消失。本症在小兒流行時，成人亦易侵害，其症象大致仿彿。惟麻痺常侵襲兩足兩腕，或四肢，故爲廣汎性。慢性本症則多發於成年男子，無急性高熱等前驅症候，其麻痺狀態則同。治療··急性病者須隔離，與急性傳染病同。對症療法，電氣療法，在麻痺時可使用，但無卓效。（六）痙攣性脊髓麻痺，本病發生原因，半由於梅毒及急性傳染病，半由先天性側索錐體道之變性。其主徵爲運動性不全麻痺，筋肉過度緊張，及痙攣腱反射亢進。其麻痺始發於下肢，漸蔓延於軀幹上肢，步行時覺疲勞及衰弱。劇者下肢筋肉緊張，膝部强直難屈，行時趾端常膠着地上，百常困難，所謂攣麻痺性步行是也。數年後則致完全麻痺。本症如係先天性，則每發於一家族中。本症如係原發性者，時能全治。治療除梅毒原因療法外，其對症療法與他症同。（七）急性向上麻痺本症一名Ｌａｎｄｒｙ氏麻痺。其脊髓並無解剖上之變化。起時惡寒發熱，背部四肢疼痛，下肢感覺萎弱；未幾陷於完全麻痺，更侵及腹背胸及上肢諸肌，患者完全不能行動，甚至呼及言語咽下亦感困難。數日或兩週内，大半由呼吸或心臟麻痺而致死。本症預後不佳，治療除梅毒行原因療法外，其他均未能奏效。（八）進行悸麻痺（麻痺狂）本病爲精神病之一。其主徵爲智慧减退。蝉曈孔反射强直，言語障害。患者初呈神經衰弱狀，漸次發生精神障害，終則爲完全痴呆。其經過途程中，常現卒中或癱　様發作，因此而發生偏癱單癱者不少；但此症象大半短期即消失。本症經過，大半至二三年後漸成白痴而死。其原因與梅毒極有關，在患者脂中變化處可發見螺旋菌。治療以注意梅毒療法爲要；溴素以及安眠劑，並爲對症療法之一。（九）歇司得里症神經系機能的疾患之一。解剖方面無顯著變化。多發於女子。其症象較最複雜，舉不勝舉；關於知覺運動精神血管運動各方面，都有顯著的障礙。時發痙攣及痲痺症象，麻痺或完全性，或不完全性，或爲單癱，或爲偏癱截癱。但忽隱忽現，爲本症所固有，臂如在床内足部運動如常，而不能起立步行，所謂起立不能症是。本症直接發生生命危險殊少，但全愈極不易。治療以心理原因療法最要；砒劑鐵劑臭素劑内分泌劑等時亦有效，惟須長期方行。（十）軟骨症本症患者以婦女爲多，有謂係内分泌障礙而發生，故行卵巢切除術時有效。其骨組織内石灰質非常缺乏。症象頗爲緩慢，初時於篤骨大腿等處發無規則之疼痛，肌肉障礙，因之步行失其常度，結果骨部軟化，不能支持自體之重量，步行困難，致長期偃臥牀第，其情形與下肢麻痺頗相類似。（十一）脚氣病在本症因腿肌萎縮，致步履惟艱，其情况與下肢麻痺頗相似，尤以萎縮性一種最顯著。其原因爲營養缺乏乙種維他命所致。治療亦以此種製劑及營養偏重爲最有效。上面所舉出的幾種病症，他們共同的結果，大致不外下肢麻痺（截癱）和半身麻痺（偏癱）二種，這和一般人所目爲風癱症的主徵是狠符合的。另外像軟骨症是另有原因，歇司得里的症象是一時的，和偏癱截癱是本不相干，但我覺得外表情形是很像的，所以也列舉在此處作一比較，因這是大多數人所錯認的。關於預後一方面，除去脚氣病軟骨症歇司得里症各有其特殊的原因和療法外，其他並不是絲毫沒有辦法的。尤以帶梅毒原因行專門療治法助力最大。但第一時間需要很長久，差不多須數月一年計算的，像脊髓癆是一個例。第二治療時間愈早愈好，痙攣性脊髓固然是這様，軟骨症也是一様的。内中不治的當然也有的；像急性向上麻痺短期間即發生生命危險，脊髓炎到了慢必性也無全愈之望。總結一句，所謂風癱症須分别觀察；我們先要診斷他所患是什麽病，纔可以答覆能治愈與否一問題。（未完）五洲固本皂藥廠近况之調查（三）  知四·人造自來血之製造家産藥股之主要工作，爲人造自來人造自來血包裝室之一部血之製造，聘有專門技師，專司其事，每日平均出一千磅，其主要原料，枸橼酸鐵液之製造，亦爲該股之附帶工作。其法即用該廠所出之硫酸鐵，先製成過硫酸鐵，再以　水製成氫氱化鐵溶，入枸櫞酸中，加以適量　水，濾過蒸濃，塗於玻璃版上，低温乾燥，即得赤褐色有光澤之薄片，每日可出二十磅，專供人造自來血製造之用。五·臭藥水製造工塲室中有蒸鍋六只與臭水貯槽多具，室外設有蒸溜塔四座，供蒸取可列所兒之用，製臭水原料，即以煤氣廠所廢棄之柏油膏，蒸取出油，除去納夫他林，配以一定量之氫氯化鈉，松脂水等，通水蒸汽攪；製成，冷後濾過，分裝於四十介侖，一介侖，半介侖，四分之一介侖之容器中，即坊間所謂亞林防疫臭水是也。出産數量歷年增加，已自數千介侖增至十萬介侖矣。六·納夫他林之提取即由上項中油析出之粗塊乾燥後，用昇華法精製，其法即取粗塊，置於鐵製鍋中，低温加熱，所發生白色蒸汽，導入圓形布袋中透空泠却，疑爲白色鮮片狀結晶，該品爲製造臭水之副産物，産量不多，每年平均出三千磅。七·木塞工塲木塞工塲之設備，有刨車，切車，拉車，磨光，搖箱等共二十餘件，每日平均可出大小不同之木塞四萬枚之譜。八·糖精工場此處設備有攪在酸化裝置八座，瓷質中和器四架，螺旋眞空機兩座，大型遠心分液機兩座，小型耐酸遠心機一座，以及結晶槽蒸發鍋多具，每日可出五十餘磅，但市銷甚巨，供不應求，現又設冷氣裝置低温結晶室，及其他應用機械，一俟佈置完竢，其生産能力，當可多多增加也。九·亞林沙而工場亞林沙而即中華藥典之複方，煤溜　礅溶液，爲醫院及家庭必備之殺菌消毒要藥，向由國外輸入，一歲漏巵，亦殊可觀。該廠有鑒於此，乃自行製造，工塲設備，有容量一千磅之蒸煮碱化鍋三具外，尙有高壓過濾機一座，每日可出一千磅，手續悉合最新方法，故行銷未久，已蜚聲於醫藥兩界矣。十·成本計股成本會計，爲工廠管理治中最重大之一項，蓋原料進價及操作損失等項，屬於直接之成本計算，尙是簡單，至廠屋之占居，人工之分配，械之折舊，燃料之消耗等項，則係間接之成本，關係甚巨。而其計算甚難，巳爲近世工業經濟　專門學問，該股有專家二人主其事，助理人員七八人，可見其重要與複譍也。五洲固本皂藥廠研究室之一部㈢研究部該公司自皂藥設廠製造以來，營業更形發達，出品愈見增加，因之對於原料之選擇，與出品之改良，自有研究之必要。故於民國十五年秋添設研究部，將原有化騐工作，如藥品之鑑定，原料之審查，以及出品質料之檢騐等項，併入該部，主其事者，有藥學博士，化學碩士，理學士，工學士，以及專家技師多人，分門研究，且受私人公家委託化騐等事，設備上除一般通用之電氣乾燥箱，分析天秤，顯微鏡，白金鍋，折光鏡，旋光鏡，公光鏡，氣壓表，以及其他精細玻璃皿以外，近復添置煤氣發生裝置，水素游子測量器，洛氏比色鏡，高速率遠心機，水力振　機，顯徵攝影機，以及原素公析等項之特殊裝置，應有盡有，對於生物試騐細菌檢查等，亦有具體設備，該部之積極擴充，原爲事實上所必要，將來該廠之生物製造，與血淸痘苗等之製造，該部亦有重大之使命也。㈣設計部該部係本处五月間添設，由沈濟川君主持其事，舉凡製藥方面，關於機械之配置；工塲之設計；國内原料之調查；以及新出品之規畫進行，槪歸該部。至關於藥用原料之製造，尤加深切之注意，如無機原料中之藥用純鹽，碘鹽，溴鹽，等藥品

<p>春秋劉·三妹  瞻廬兩粤崇拜的歌仙粤歌的哀感　　，誰都承認的。『綠豆難相思』，『江水作媒人』等名名，載在梁晋竹『兩般秋雨　隨筆』，誰都讀了要『輒喚奈何』的。其實梁氏隨筆中的『粤歌』一條，是從李雨村的『南粤筆記』中摘取下來的，只是團轉載，不是創作。兩粤歌曲的祖師，據說便是歌仙劉三妹；粤人很崇拜伊的，什麽『讀詩便是劉三妹』，什麽『三妹唱歌博少年』，伊的名字眞博得婦稚皆知，伊的偉大可和屈原比　，只爲，屈原是楚國辭章之祖，劉三妹是兩粤歌曲之宗。三妹是廣西貴縣水西村人，生於唐景龍年間，处十二，歌曲絕倫，往來兩粤之間，所有諸　及村民到結婚，跳月，需要歌曲時，都來請敎於伊，甚至，有不遠千里而來的。三妹在當年，已成了兩粤歌曲中的權威。關係劉三妹的神話頗多，最普徧的便是王漁洋『池北偶談』中的一則，據云··『三妹與邕州白鶴秀才登西山高　爲三日歌，秀才歌芝房曲』，本妹答以『紫鳳歌』··秀才歌『桐生南獄』三妹答以『蝶飛秋草』··秀才變歌『朗陵花』，三妹答以『南山白石』詞都哀切；竟七日夜，兩人均化爲石。三妹與秀才的互歌，世都不傳；寳山沈萝塘替他們作補亡六章，詞人之筆，總不免有些斧鑿痕，不能和『出於天籟』者相比。就中『南山白石歌』最合歌謠體裁，其詞如左··西山低，南山高，望郎三暮連三朝；蛛有絲兮水不斷，妾有心兮石不轉；明年春色朗陵花，花開花落無人管！說殺  淸癯殺！本是一個不祥的名詞，考說文，作『戮』这解。然而周禮春官内史掌王之八柄之法。以詔王治。五曰殺。疏支『太宰有誅無殺。此有殺無誅。誅與殺相因。見爲過不正，則殺之也。』不過法有分别，而誅與殺，同爲戮人之意，沒有什麽兩様，又秋官掌戮斬殺，諜而搏之，註『斬以斧鉞，殺以刀刃』，那末斬和殺，就有些不同了，其實殺之一字，並不是狹義，春秋隱元年，公羊傳曰『克之者何？殺之也！』是殺有克的意思，禮王制『天子殺則不緩，諸侯殺則下小緩，大夫殺則止佐車，』註殺『獲』也，是殺又有得的意思，不但這様，孟子七篇中有『凶年不能殺』，則殺字代替死字用，後漢吳祐傳，『欲殺靑簡以冩經書』·以火炙簡，令，取其靑·易書·後竟不　，呌『殺靑』，亦呌『汗靑』，同一殺字，而用法却各有所取，亦看用的人有當有不當罷了。到了現在這一個『殺』字，也就像跟著國家政治上一切的變遷而進化，那前淸的梟首，這種酷刑廢除以後，頭可不殺了，以外不操刀而殺人的東西，不好說沒有，畢竟殺字，不離乎死字範圍，若眞提起刀來，加在自己身上，恐怕不是病狂，和受萬分重大的刺激，是决不會自戕的，就呌『自肉割勿痛』，這是很正確的，那知上海地方『自殺』的人，近年來偏是一天多一天，倘拿市府裏所調查的自殺統計表一看，眞是要驚人哩！實在都不是死在刀鋒之下，而一切一切的殺人用品，也就見得比以前厲害，不止萬倍呢？『自殺』或者一個人出於末奈何，以致陡生短見，而圖一瞑不視以自了，在這種情形之下，沒有不嘆口氣，說一聲『可憐』啊？豈知又有極貴重的生命，一旦無端的被人所算，出其不意，目之爲『暗殺』砰然幾響，就倒臥在血泊之中，一縷冤魂，竟飄入枉死城裏，這是甚麽道裏，唉！近點算，三十年來，金琴生後，最大的『暗殺』案，就是宋敎仁，被武士英狙擊於車站鐵欄之旁，其他小的案件，眞是不少，國家『明殺』的極刑廢除，呌是進化，社會上『暗殺』的列人日多，難道也算進化麽？且尤其是像上海最繁盛的都市，偏常會發生這不幸的事件，給人聽了，不由得要提心吊膽，就是路上行走，也好似步荆棘一般，你想！好不危險啊！子樓詩存偶感  庚曰少卑吾論或行今，花近高樓百不禁。翻爲無營躭美睡，政緣晚出愛輕陰輕陰。憂深漸變尋常態，憤甚難温過去心。兒女風懷階級感，憐渠四海有呻吟。夏夜無寐  庚曰夜半聞人籟，招凉閏五天。跳　貓喚急，入枕萝來偏。漸曉風絲細，初晴鳥語圓。相呼車過市，海屋幾桑田？　色明　際，率懷冷腰多。艱難中歲事，浩　酒人歌。質勝儒冠賤，民窮國論訛。危邦生聚盡，蛇豖爾如何？東北四連長  張恨水第十回聞語警芳心封侯願渺聽歌現羡色報國身閑假使我要娶親的話，雖不能請一個月期有的假，在這兩個星期之中，我不要糊裏糊塗的過去了，必得要好好的快活一下子。桂枝在　海甸這街上，總算是數一數二的姑娘，娶得這様美麗的姑娘，也就心裏滿足的了。他想到了這裏，在公共汽車上的賣票生，是他的熟人，就問道··趙連長，您心裏有什麽高興的事情呢？怎麽一個人想着笑起來了呢？趙自强道··我笑了嗎？我自己倒不知道。賣票生道··這就可以知道您正在想着什麽得意的事了。趙自强微笑道··有什麽得意，我想我若是有孫猴那個能耐就好了。招來天兵天將騰雲駕霧，殺到日本去。全車乘客因爲他是個軍人，他說了這話，大家就都笑了。賣票生道··到了海甸了，您下不下？趙自强道··時候不早了，我要回營了，不下了。他說着這話時，海甸的街屋，巳經在窗子外，他想着，回家去一趟，只躭擱十分八分鐘，那也不要緊。回空的時候，一定可以看到桂枝的，看他今天對我的感情，究竟有什麽特别之處沒有。於是向賣票生道··停車停車，我要下，我要下。賣票生笑道··還沒有到站呢，趙連長今天一定有什麽好事，要不然，不能夠這様了樂大發了。趙自强微笑着，始終是不作聲。說時，汽車已經停了，車子上有兩個客人下去。賣票生，見他兩手按着膝蓋，抬頭看了汽車棚頂，一句别的話也不說。賣票生笑道··趙連長，都下去了啦，您下不下呢？趙自强忽然回轉頭來，看到車門是開的，笑道··不下罷。下下。他說着話，巳經跳下了車。但聽到車子上的人，哄然大笑。自己也不敢回頭，只管向家門口走着去了。（一一一）戀妓的故事  賢賢日本岡山縣葛成村警察駐在所巡警小川郁夫氏，因爲和該縣玉島町的妓女發生了愛情，互擬嫁娶。但是小川氏是一員巡警，怎來量珠之資，於是利令智昏，竟闖進安田銀行的玉島町分銀行，把行長渡邊卓夫勒死，而刦去三萬四千元。在我國，社會上流傳很廣，而頗膾炙人口的，有『賣油郎獨占花魁女』的一個故事。『花魁女』是一位名妓，『賣油郎』是一個窮鬼。以一個混身都是油光膩味的窮鬼，而能獨占花枝招展的絕世佳人，寗百非奇事。據說，賣油郎因爲欲一親花魁女芳澤，特地節衣縮食，凑成了夜　資，更做了一套新衣服，與忽忽地上花魁女香巢。眞不巧，花魁女給人招出去侑酒了。直到夜漏更殘，花魁女回來巳醉得不省人事，而且哇的一聲，五臓　裏的黃酒白米飯，山珍海味湯，都倒了出來。賣油郎生怕錦衾繡褥，沾上了油汚，便舉起袖來，承住了櫻口中的穢物。待到花魁女酒性旣退，問知底　，感恩知己，便脫却烟花籍，嫁了賣油郎。從這二個故事的上半段看來，『窮光蛋戀妓』，小川郁夫氏，　可賣油郎拜得把，換得『金蘭譜』。但是下半段，就分出手段來了。賣油郎千種温柔，百般憐愛，一夕辛勤，成就了百年好合。小川氏舍正路而勿由，貪從心上起，惡自胆邊生，殺人刦財，只落得捉將官裏去，成就了百年長恨。從此看來，究竟是賣油郎該做大哥哥。有人說，賣油郎可代表中國的民族性，善於『博取人憐』，小川氏可代表日本的民族性，凡事『一味曫幹』。那倒也有幾分意思。力量  雙紅現時代要想出來找事，或找到了事而要謀位置的永久，那末第一要靠你的力量怎様？氣力大，不是力量，本領高，不是力量；藝術學識都好，更不是力量；什麽是力量？背後有人，纔是力量！手頭有錢，纔是力量！你若是背後旣沒有人，手頭又沒有錢，那末勸你切勿胡思亂想！婦女樂團歡迎女飛行家林鵬俠  定明好　似乎是我的天性··好見奇奇怪怪的人，好聽奇奇怪怪的事，郤是我的本能。『林鵬俠，林鵬俠，』前幾天報紙上的新聞，副刋上的稿料，點綴着，點綴着；『林鵬俠，林鵬俠。』『女飛行家林鵬俠！』前晚友聲旅行團同人和愛好旅行的同志們，聯合歡宴林鵬俠女士；約摸七點一刻鐘的當兒，忽然『丁零零』地　聲突到，在聲隊童子軍團長華明聲轉達常委的電話來了；徬彿調軍遣將上戰場的一通『動員令，』臨時要我到；我就約了同事管一鳴像出發的戰士般趕快前去。踏上四川路大中華，長長的西餐筵上，橫　兩邊坐滿了人；東頭友聲常委姚元幹君，滿面春風，坐在主人位，靠左的南端是上客林鵬俠和一位女友，女友左是新婚的新人貴人黃警頑君，黃側露出來個臉龐，原來是寛眉大眼有虎　中郎之似的黃新夫人柏志安女士，偏眼尖，伊首先笑嘻嘻地向我點點頭；我同一鳴敬陪西邊北端的末座；一回兒，姚先生起立致歡迎辭，林女士纰纰繼續起立演講；我遠遠地地電燈光下回顧，見鵬俠女士如舊小說裏所說的黃人黃衣秦瓊般　糾糾地站着，但耳朶裏緊緊波進來銀鈴似地聲音；一口流利爽脆的北平語··我坐的雖遠，聽得郤很明白··『·····去年十一月二十四日動身·····上海······南京·····徐州·····從潼關坐公共汽車·····』路　　······苦極······到西安······和騎兵二師參謀長一批軍隊大家乘四大四小汽車······高山峻嶺，偶一下　，溝深萬丈，十分危險，但我淡然置之。······到蘭州······很好，不過路太壞；匪氛不靖······就我一人······到店夜深一點餘。······到西寗······靑海。』『到靑海想去遊海心山，都勸不要去，以爲天太冷；過去有人因天冷凍掉耳朶鼻子，我辯豈外國人能去，我不能去。·····但我一定要去·····駐軍派當地女代表兩位······踏冰海上山，一路山靑水秀，非常高興·····天冷極·····在荆氏表零度以下······睡草地上覺得很有意思。······到山上，水苦，沒辦法，山　幸有雪，於是掬雪化水煮茶，大家還爭多嫌少······』『回到魯沙···西寗······往北到甘州······洒泉······嘉峪關······新疆因亂未去。······回蘭州到定遠驛······看達理扎雅王爺。······渡黃河乘皮筏子到寗夏去，中途經大峽口之牛巴子，頂頂危險。······從寗夏到阿拉善額······仍是坎肩長　。······寗夏······黃牛非常多。·····乘騾車到五原······吃炒麵，他們以爲好，我郤以爲又···上當了。·····改乘長途汽車到包頭···乘平綏鐵路到歸綏。······到張家口，日本人怎様，國難是什麽，人人都不知道；男男女女，熱熱閙閙，一點不覺得危險。·····北平······天津·····搭輪船······六月三日回上海。』『·····西北情形很嚴重要緊。······開發西北，有種種的辦法。······從不海到南京······首先向交通部報告，開發西北以交通爲當務之急。』我不能學能言的鸚鵡，人云人云；也不慣說違心的話，出世以來並不曾。先是友聲月刋上載了黃警頑君一篇關於林女士的文章，裏面有一段說陜西災民的慘狀；並陸陸續續拿林女士的旅途通信給我瞧；我滴涙，熱涙沾襟；我爲陜西的前途，西北的前途，中國華民族的前途，人類的前途和在一起，暗暗呑聲飲泣。『奇女子！難得！難得！·····希望伊在空航界有大表現！』我們遲一刻慢步在淡淡的電燈光下縮着，縮着，縮着回社的路線的中途說。</p>

<p>自由談世界人  豈凡我們中國人，常常受着不正當的　笑··什麽沒有團結力像生盤散沙，什麽沒有國民思想不。或個國家，什麽不懂公德，缺少愛國心，無秩序，無組織，利己的個人主義的色彩太　厚，貪得無厭，又務盧名要面了··凡此種種，都是國民性的　點，而國家的所以褒頽，也是因此之故云云。把中國人作爲一種國民看，的確是成績不良，應加　頓的。東隣說我們還沒有近代國家的組織，也是應受的　悔。但人生於世界之上，立足们天地之間，一定要做一　國家的國民嗎？倘使我們的眼光再放大一點，對於國家的組織社會的權成有更徹底的認　之後，把觀點改變一下，就可知道中國人是世界頂優秀的民族了。因爲中國人都是世界人。我們中國，一向不是一個國家而是天下世界，皇帝是天子，率土之濱莫非王臣，四海之内皆兄弟也，政治的理想是進世界於大同，那偏狹的國家主義，素來不是我們所知道所企求的·數千年來旣有這様傳統的下想，所以不必經什麽宣傳倡導而我們都是天生的世界人。這徵諸於我民族的酷愛和平，不尚殺伐，就可知道。世界人對於國土疆域是不關心的，而目標只在能安居樂業，所以國内的割據局面，日人的侵占東北，政權的攘奪，内戰的循環，我們並不怎様開心，卽使開心到，也只是在人民生命財産之是否安全及能否安居樂業上着想而己。因爲人民認定這些統治者，不過是些滑稽有的人物抱敬鬼神而遠之的想度素來不想去參加的。中國人對於政治的一無興味，就因爲根本不承認他的重要，中國不是老早就有『日出而作，日入而息，鑿井而飲，耕田而食，帝力於我何有哉！』的歌謠嗎？一方面中國人自治的能力極好，因爲根本不信任官僚，所以一切要自己來維持，只就華人以前在南洋開拓的成績來想，就可知道，而現在國内許多事情，也還是人民自理，並不依賴什麽官力，却頗能有點成績的。所以他人的侮蔑之言，我們大可置之不理，更不必因此氣短，我們中國人前途是大有可爲的。最重要的一點，全在把觀點改變過來。明白世界大勢所趨，確定世界理想的在於大同，那麽我們前途决沒有可以悲觀的地方。只要想到有這一大羣的天定世界人，一旦起來作世界大同的積極行動，豈非莫能抗禦的嗎？不要因爲目下的厄運悲觀消沈，我們有光榮的前途在前面呢。文豪飛行隊  沈起予在『聚而殱之』『雖賸至一兵一卒，亦必抵抗到底』等等聲浪中·復有『航空救國』的口號，實在是使人欣快的事情。現在『聚而殱之』雖已功成圓滿，『抵抗到底』亦旣事實昭著，但『航空救國』的壯舉，在五十萬元的頭彩萝中，還是幹得非常起勁。那末，我來給諸君報告一個『文豪飛行隊』的消息，也未始不可給熱心救國的先生們添些興罷。這文豪不是中國的小白臉『胡博士』·而是俄國的土老兒高爾基。據說俄國正在製造一架大飛機來裝載印刷機和電影的攝影機等·並且這不過是實現高氏所提倡的文化運動中之一部，這祇是民間航空隊所創設的『高爾基飛行隊』的先導機。這個『高爾基飛行隊』係由四十人乘機一架，九人乘機一架，小型飛機數架，空積六千五百立方米突的飛行船艘組成。或者有人說··現在飛機之慘酷，已盡人皆知，以大文豪來提倡飛機，豈非成了『大武豪』麽？我說··　不用担心！因爲這飛行隊之目的，祇在飛到偏僻之區去作普及文化的工作，飛到那些做夢也不曾見過飛機的人們的地域去隨時散布傳單，去請他們看電影，至於小型飛機，也不外拿來帮助土老兒們做『播種』或『收穫』等事罷了。因爲這和日本人及中國人自己用來在中國各地抛擲炸彈的飛機稍異其趣，所以據我的意思，這倒確乎値得熱心提倡『航空救國』的先生們注意一下。雨夜  程雲萍夜色侵入了我們的小房間，門外，雨在瀟瀟地下着。『媽媽，點土燈罷，夜啦·』孩子靠在妻的膝上，呌着。坐在對面的妻的影子，漸漸模糊起來。妻沉默着，顯然是在思索什麽。孩子以爲媽媽沒聽到，接着呌··『媽媽，暗啦，我怕暗，給點上油燈罷！』在黑暗中坐着的妻，這纔嘆了一口深長的氣，回答··『我的好孩子，爸爸沒有買油，不要鬧罷！』『爸爸爲什麽不買油呢？』『你看，老天爺天天下着大雨，爸爸怎能夠上山去打柴賣！』『那兒來的錢買油，不要多嘴罷！』妻不耐煩了。孩子也許心裏仍在疑惑，但是他不敢再問下去了。唉，孩子怎能知道大人的苦處呢？接着，妻向我說··『家裏眞的』個錢也沒有啦，再下幾天雨，我們怎麽辦？我想，無論怎様，你明兒還是到城裏去走一趟，向林叔公借借看。空走一趟也說不得，在家裏總不會有辦法的！！唉，看情形今年又不得了，禾苗全給雨水沖壞了。去年榖賣不起價錢，今年連榖也沒得吃呢！···』妻這様嘆息着。孩子又嚷起來了··『甚麽東西呌？我怕，我怕暗，媽媽·抱抱我！』在黑暗中，我聽見一巴掌拍在頭上的聲音，接着我們可憐的孩子哭起來了。在孩子的哭聲中，我咀咒着我，我的妻子和我們的孩子所同有的這悲苦無告的運命。除了運命，我們還能咀咒什麽呢？『·····』我沒有做聲，在心裏嘆息着。門外，雨仍在瀟瀟地地下着。中國藝術界  猛克一向寂的中國藝術界，最近一年來，怱然頗爲熱鬧了。當局者于『共赴國難』的百忙中，也特别熱心來提倡藝術。革命蠁家梁鼎銘先生的『沙基慘案』巨　，就是靠了這様的　　，才迅速地在三年的短期内完成的；據說，不久還要在我們的首都，爲這不朽之作建造一所巍峩的大畫堂呢。今年中央研究院不是又派遣徐　鴻到法蘭西去舉行中國美展麽？明年或者再明年，派出國的藝術家恐怕還要多呢。要增進國際的感情，藝術確是再好沒有的工具··在戰爭的科學利器趕不上列强之前，也唯有反過來提倡藝術，才足以拯救中國。物質方面不够的時候，便以精神濟之中國直至今日，到底還不夫爲一個文明的古國。上海，是各帝國主義在遠東的唯一大商塲，而中國的『文代中心』，也正是這大商場的上海　　全中國的大藝術家，　　事在這中國的『文化中心』地。不過往日，中國的藝術家總是『懷才不遇』，在喊着苦悶的；現在當局者忽然風　起來，捧戲子似的捧他們了，這眞是千載一時之積，說起來，倒要感謝日本飛機的。新近，在上海産生的『名正言順』的藝術社，眞如『雨後春筍』，一天多似一天。而第每一個月中，至少有一兩個展覽會的廣告在報紙上出現；那些廣告，總少不了名人們的介紹或題問；最奇的，是在這些名人鋒中，竟有不少商界軍界的領袖。至於新出的藝　刋物，最莊　而神聖的，當推藝屬和藝術旬刋，那　邊，滿是『爲藝術而藝術』的高深學理。不過他們並不合作，而且簡直還有些敵對行爲，『同行生嫉妒』原是人之常情，也難怪的，其實所謂敵對行爲，也不過止于敵視。可哀的是··藝術旬刋不外擴充爲藝術月刋，而藝術月刋只出兩期，就忽然由擴充而縮緊到沒有了。　刋物，的確是一件艱事，倘抓不住讀者，雖有巨額的經費，也等如不出。所以大藝術家們常痛惜地說··『中國靑年不專心研究學問，眞危險透了！』藝術究竟是高尚的，惟有名流學者才能懂得，惟有資本家才有資格欣賞，平常人，那是不敢也不能隨便走入·『藝術之宮』的。譬如展覽會吧，就都開在門禁森嚴的洋樓上。你如果一身襤褸，只要看守門巡捕的眼色，便得趕快　　，即使你　　溜進　　　　　　　　明其妙的溜出來，　了　邊　大　　子，是找不到一件你所熱悉的東西的·然而你不能　　，因爲你不幸是個平常人·沒有錢，沒有聽過大藝術家有講演，沒有見過米格朗，達文西，馬帝斯，比加索諸大師的　作，所以你不能懂，你沒有資格欣賞。但中國靑年眞危險透了，竟有一夥靑年術學徒，居然敢在暗中幹起平常人都不屑幹的下賤工作，在他們的作盡是一些衣不蔽體的難看的怪物；而最可怕的，是這些難看的怪物都凶很地圓睜着眼睛，張開大口狂吼。並且這一夥叛逆的靑年，始終在壓迫之下存在，工作，而且發展。去年的春笛社雖然失敗，繼之又有ＭＫ木刻社的組織，最近兩次在某校舉行的木刻展覽會的成績，就是一種大量的收獲！『怎麽辦呢？』大衆本身的，熟悉的，所感到興趣的東西，到底有多數的大衆來擁護。自然，在技巧上他們是幼穉的，譬如他們作品上的人物的面目，大都像外國人的臉。這顯然的，是多看了外國木刻集的影響，但是，正因其幼穉，就證明還是年輕，最有希望。誰顧意丟開自己熟悉的東西，去看那些金邊大架子呢？紅蘿蔔鬚  ＪｕｌｅＫｅｎａｒｎ林取譯反叛（　）（二）紅蘿蔔鬚閉了嘴不響，但他站着不動。『瞧啦，這竟是一個革命啦！』雷辟克家的在樓梯上呌說，高舉着兩臂。不錯，紅蘿蔔鬚回答她一個『不』字，這確是第一次。如果她打擾了他，那猶可說！如果他正在玩着，那猶可說！但他却坐在地上，仰着頭，閉着眼睛，在無聊地空想着。而現在他竟大胆一凝視着她。她完全莫明其妙了。她好像呌别人來救命似的，把大家喊來。『爰勒絲丁，菲利克斯，這麥出了新聞！快點同你們的父親和亞伽持一塊來看啦。什麽人來都不會嫌多的。』甚至連街上稀有的過路客都可停下來。紅蘿蔔鬚兀自立在院子裏，奇怪自己竟能很鎭定的臨對危艱，尤其吃驚的是雷辟克家的竟忘記打他。事情是那麽嚴重，竟使她一時手足無措。她對着那銳利的像一個紅點般的燃燒着的眼光，自然而然抛棄了平素那種威嚇的手腕。可是她雖盡力忍耐着，但她的嘴唇被一種内心的狂怒壓迫着，吐出了一種哨音。『列位朋友，聽我說啦，』她說，『我很客氣地請紅蘿蔔鬚給我盡一個很小的義務，呌他散步時順便到磨坊去一下。你們猜他怎様回答我的；請你們問他自己罷，不然還會以爲是我揑造的呢。』每個人都猜着了，祇看他的態度就知道，用不着要他再說的。温柔的愛勒絲丁走近去，低低地在他耳邊說道··『當心啦，你會遭到禍害的。服從罷，聽你姐姐的話罷，她是疼你的。』大哥菲克斯像在看把戲一様。他是不會把他的位子讓給任何人的。他並沒有想到如果紅蘿蔔鬚免除了役使，那麽一部分差事照理會要輪到長兄身上來的··看來他還在鼓勵他呢。昨天，他還輕視他，把他看作卑怯的東西。今天，他却以平等的眼光注視他，並且尊重他起來。他跳躍着，高興極了。『這旣像是已經臨着世界的末日，那末我可不管這事了。』雷辟克家的頽喪地說，『我現在抽開身子。請另外一個人來說說看，來使得這野獸馴服起來罷。現在父親兒子都在這裏。請他們把這事弄淸楚一下罷。』『爸爸，』紅蘿蔔鬚說，喉嚨像被絞着一般，因爲他還缺少習慣呢，『如果你要求我到磨坊去買這斤牛油，我可以爲着你去一趟，單單爲着你。我不會爲着我的母親去走這一趟的。』雷辟构對於他這偏愛，不單不感着高興，反像感着厭煩。這様一來，他便不好行使他的權力了，因爲爲着一斤牛油，紅蘿蔔鬚這様和他母親閙着，爲敷衍許多看客起見，他是不能不給他幾句敎訓的。但他泰然地在草地上走了幾步，聳聳肩，翻轉身走進屋裏去了。事情暫止於此。末了的話晚邊，乃過了夜膳，雷辟克家的氣病了，睡在床上，沒有出來用膳；在餐桌上，各人都沉默着，一則習慣如此，二則大家都有點窘，雷辟克把飯巾結好，丟在桌上，說道··『沒有一個人願意和我到靠近舊路的畢基仰去散散步嗎？』</p>

<p>经济專刋第廿八期每逢星期一出版中國紡織業之將來朱仙舫···衣爲人生四大需要之一，用之以章身也；生民無論如何困難，章身則不可無衣。成衣之物，不一其頽，而棉布爲最普徧，於是棉織工業亦因棉布　要之殷而愈見重要。吾國自淸季以機械從事紡織，積四十餘年之歷史，所或就者僅紗錠二百五十餘萬枚。國土之内，外人經營之廠，則有紡錠二百萬枚，日人占錠一百八十萬枚，近且有就上海靑島各建三十萬錠新廠之計劃，駸駸與吾相埒，將駕而上之矣。而吾國已往，上自政府下及社會人士，每視紡織廠爲利蔽，苛捐雜稅，直接間接徵之於廠者，疊床架屋，不勝縷　；其服務於廠者，自員司至工人，以爲大利歸於廠，每不肯努力於所務；其主持廠務者，又不知爲緊縮改進之圖，致不能保有其廠，更易者比比；其幸而主持得人，固有其相當發展，然發展之度，終不若政府之能出於保護，社會組織完密，各業能相維繫之國之顯著。故吾國紡織業雖有悠久經歷，而距衣能自給程度猶甚遠也。廻以農村經濟崩潰，購買力低降，加之日貨傾銷，東北三省旣絕華紗銷售之路，華北市塲亦幾爲日紗所占有，華北紗廠所産之紗，反而南來求售，上海一埠所積之紗，乃達　年未有之巨額。遂不得不出於减少工作，减少生産之一逾，免致多量存積，價値跌落，則至成本以下，業務衰弛，尤岌岌不可終日。然則　長此偃伏，不别謀出路可乎？若然，彼傾銷政策得逞其圖，吾則將永無復興之日。况少工作，因而消費之得减省者，僅勞工工資·物料消耗·動力用費·三項，而利息·保險·捐稅·及職員等項·支出，仍不得稍减，每件成本，轉以此而加重，故减少工作之時期愈外久，虧折之度愈高，事亦愈不可爲。故惟有推究紗銷所以不振之因何在，今以農村經濟崩潰購買力弱爲其理由者，猶是表面之因也。蓋吾國現有錠數與人數比，可决其求過於供，不嗼過剩。所以積滯不銷，正爲有『附骨之疽』之日紗，充斥市塲貶價傾銷所致也。自新稅則頒行，進口棉貨稅率提高，但彼得在華設廠，爲馬開條約所特許又得其政府之援助，金融業之接濟，恃其組織之完善，技術之精良，仍可以最低之價，傾銷於市塲。故吾如欲作持久抵抗，求一出路，以圖發展，固應由紡織業自身之奮鬭，但亦需政府社會之力，茲分别言之。甲　於紡織廠自身者㈠老廠厲行合理化改革吾全國紡織廠之由國人自營者，共八十二所，成立於三十年前者五之二，成立於十年前者半。三十年以上之機械，其效能，不可與二十年以上者较；二十年以上之機械，其效能不可與十年以上者較，晚近機械更有顯著之進步。蓋自各工業先進國倡行合理化工作後，於工程之繁複者簡單之，生産則力求增加，消費則力求節縮，機械準是製成，效能益著，故得以價廉質美之成品，暢銷市塲。老廠機械無其精美，欲求同一步趨勢必爲合理化之改革。卽將機件磨滅於長時間運轉者更換之，工程之不合理化者簡單之，舉凡有礙生産，與品質者精密整理之，設備之不完善者補充之，以及勞力動物料，不使爲無益之消費，能致力於此，老廠不難得新廠之實，而可免於淘汰。㈡新廠擇産銷紗之地創設並請富有經騐之專家設計原料取給，成品銷售，爲發展工業之要件。吾國紡織廠集中上海，錠數達一百十餘萬，合外人所設之廠，幾占全國總錠數三分之二，已有膨脹之象。故今後宜轉移目光於内地，新廠擇産棉銷紗之地創設之，原料取給旣易，成品銷售亦便，工人易僱，運輸省費，尙其餘事。惟於創設之際，一切須請富有經騐之專家，本生産合理化原則，爲之設計。務求减少固定資金負擔運轉後，在能以至少努力發揮最大生産；更須有完善設備？使紡織工程不受天氣影響减少産額；有機械完備之試駖室，使從事紡織工作人員，能就出品精密試騐，致力技術，以進於精良。㈢添設整理漂染印花廠整理漂染印花，爲布疋織成後必經之工程。試取輸入之棉織物觀之，莫不賴整理染印之功，增其艷　，高其價格，面得人樂用，此整理染印工程，有助長紡織工程之效，不可忽視也。新稅則於色染織物提高稅率，國産織物，必將因色之染印，而增其暢銷之度，吾國紡織廠，有整理染印設備者，須從事推廣，未設者亟一謀增設，或更合組大規模之漂染印花廠，以適應此種需要也。乙屬於政府者㈠推廣棉植改進棉質吾國原則棉産量，據華商紗廠聯合會報告，最近二年平均，每年爲七，二五二，七○八擔，銷費量爲八，九一二，九二五擔，輸入量則由民國八年之二三九·二一八擔進而爲四　五八四一○○○擔，二十一年且居入　貨　第二位。外棉輸入愈多，卽國棉供給愈少，而國棉供給所以减少其量者，雖有其他原因，但織維粗短，末然撚廻數少，不適高支紗棉之紡製，尤爲重大原因。故細紗細布之消費量日增，國棉之需要量則日减，而取給外棉以爲細紗細布之原料，則爲量日多，盈虚消長，非無因也。生民慾望由質而文，旣不能復返於質，卽不能减少細紗細而布之消費。則吾國棉産，於質的方面，應改進棉種，産生織維細長原棉，以供紡製精細紗棉之需。量的方面，爲大量生産，俾紡織業原料可以自給，無待外求。深望政府運用政治力量，提倡督促，以實現之也。㈡致力保護提高棉貨輸入稅率，已於新稅則中見之矣，國内紡織業已得一保障。但外商仍得在華設廠，挾其優良技術，新式機械，雄厚資本，仍非吾可與敵。故必增加統稅，而於華廠，則將所增加者發還，作爲獎勵金，然此又將牽涉其他問題，政府能否有此决心此其一再則華廠爲外廠壓迫，發展維艱，失敗堪虞，而視投資紡織爲畏途。政府如眞誠獎掖紡織事業，須行俣息政策，此張南通長農工商部時曾倡行之。他如低减運費，制止地方抽收雜捐，以及年來工潮蓬勃，動輒發生糾紛，影響業務至匪淺鮮，當局應飭令地方當局從發展實業上改善勞資間關係無左右袒，亦無爲本國廠商多加桎梏摧折，無異間接助外廠之發展也。㈢增進紡織敎育敎育所以作育人才以知識技能於以取給者也。吾國紡織工廠八十二所需用技術人員達四千人爲之培成者，及今猶僅南通紡織專校一所。該校成立二十所，畢業十六屆，凡三百四十一人。服務工廠者僅二二九人。合留學歐美日本專攻紡織，歸任工廠技術，及由其他工校紡科畢業者計之，不足五百人，是技術人員之有相當學歷者，僅十之一·二五。以視各棉業國之工作人員，能各本所學而運用之，其程度相去爲何如乎？故欲充實各誻技術内容，必先增進紡織敎育，而爲人才之培成。下走曾力倡其說，且具有計劃，爲紡織當業及實業部言之。并不自量力，由中國紡織學會就滬西·東·區各設紡織夜校一所，以應從事紡織工務者補習技術之需。爲内地紡織廠職員及有志紡織業者修學計，更有函授學校之籌設，但學會力量棉薄，不能暢行所願，是必有賴於政府爲積極之設施矣。交通大學末學年有紡織學系之增設，其他工科學校，倘能繼之而行，是尤充實紡織人才，發展紡織之要圖。顧紡織原料，有棉·毛·絲·麻·四種，依原料分類研究紡織之學科，有棉紡織，毛紡織，及絲麻紡織。適應吾國需要，亟待推進之紡織工業，則爲棉毛。培植人才，推行此重要工業，則爲棉毛紡織。他若整理漂染，有助長紡織工業之效，均須爲之培植。使事業界不感人才不充，此尤望於從事增進紡織敎育者籌及之也。丙屬於社會者㈠服用國産紗布一國之消費，能自給並以給人者則國恒富，反之而仰給於人者則恒困。吾國自通商以還，消費取給於國内所産者，則年隘其量；取給於國外輸入者，則年增其數。其他姑不論，製衣之布，爲量尤多。日人且利用吾民愛用廉價貨物之心理，故貶其價，以相傾銷，使吾紡織業蒙受巨創，幾難自存。經濟侵略之險毒，固不稍亞於飛機大砲也。吾民如不欲爲亡國之民，宜嚴厲力行，物非吾産者勿用，布非吾産者勿服，更努力發展工業，使國内生産能供消費之需，不虞不足。蓋能服國産之服，則國人以錢易布，紡織廠卽以易得之錢，購買國産原棉，製爲織物，金錢可常循環吾農工商之間，而不外溢，其理至淺，華廠織物不僅不致滯銷，且必擴充産量以應消費，是則願國人鑒於國難之殷，服用轼國産紗布，自培國力，兼以煦育紡織工業也。㈡金融界予以切實維護年來水旱頻仍，匪共肆暴，　之富裕者，不能樂其業，安共居，挾其所有，遷居都市，以銀行較爲可靠也，儲其資金於銀行，於是現金集中都市，而感過剩。農村則愈見窮因，而購買力愈减少商業以農民購買力之薄弱而愈肅條。故欲繁榮今後之工商業，必先復興農村，助其生産，使能以所産易取金錢，恢復其購買力，則商可因貨物易銷而復興，工可因生産增加而復榮。但農村之復興也，必有金融業爲之調劑，工商之復歸繁榮也，必賴金融業爲之維護。紡織工業關係民生恭切，當此外貨傾銷，業務受嚴重脅迫期，使歸於安定。進而以圖發展，以求自給，尤非金融業共爲有力之協助，不能竟其功。人方協以謀我，唇亡齒寒，我金融業當亦不忍袖手也。上列各端，係合政府社會及紡織當業之力，打破現時險惡之環境，而謀紡織業之安定，更於奮鬥中求出路。誠以吾國人民四萬萬與現有紡錠二百四十萬枚　比率，爲每一　五十人占錠一枚，以較英國人口與錠數爲一一七·一○○之比；日本爲九·一○○之比；瞠乎其後。徒因歷受資本主義國家經濟侵略，及國人不　力紡織之故，而致外貨輸入，年愈關銀二萬萬兩，居進口進貨物第一位。倘國有能服國産之服，能用國産之棉，則農業興盛，工商繁榮同，蓋亦相聯而至之結果也。不侫　爲衣被計，曾草有推進棉業三三計　，陳諸院部，於推廣棉植，增加機械，規定棉紡區域，培養技術人才，籌集資金，均有　列，其大要在增加國産原棉，能應全國紡織機械銷費之需，而紡織機械之産物，能應全國衣被之需，三期推進，期各三年，國人在國難方張，痛定思痛之餘，其各奮所能，各致其力，中國紡織業之將來，實利賴之。救濟絲兩業與鐵路運輸之關係鄭寳照···（一）紗業危機之由來吾國紗廠之興衰，一以棉價與紗價之變遷爲轉移。棉賤紗貴，則獲利；棉貴紗賤，則虧折；就表面上觀之，此固理所當然者；然紗廠營業何以一任市價變遷之支配，而不克自拔，此則必非理之所當然，而爲人事未盡環境不良之所致也。今上海華商紗廠又以減工聞矣。其危機之迫切，似較襄時之所遇者爲尤甚。究其致此之由。則仍爲棉貴紗賤也。考棉貴紗賤之原因固多，而其所以造成紗業之危機者原因亦夥。舉其著者，則本國棉花品質不良，供給不足，不得不仰於外棉，而金貴銀賤，外棉之換算價格自昂一也；本國棉花之産於陜西湖北等地者，運輸轉輾，水脚甚昂，以致棉價亦隨之提高，二也；門户洞開，日商設廠於上海及其他内地，與我競爭遂致生産過剩，相率貶價傾銷，三也；華商紗廠財力不如日廠之厚，管理不如日廠之善，出品不如日廠之良，事事後人相形見絀，立足之難，當可想見，四也；華商紗廠借貸，利息甚重，高者達一分五六厘之巨，返觀日廠，則有其本國銀行爲後盾，能得低利之貸欵，是以華商之開繳，因是亦增多不少五也，華商紗廠以屯積爲能事，紗貴則居奇待沽，以期紗價之再漲，紗賤則脫手爲難，羣望紗價之回升，以致存貨山積，週轉不靈，六也；年來國中工商凋敝，農村衰頽，人民購買力滅低，致紗布之銷路亦滯，七也，國家缺乏保護之方，對於外商營業，未能與以差别之待遇，以資維護，臂諸弱小之花木，常受暴雨之侵凌，欲其發榮滋長，勢有未能，八也。以上所舉，或爲近因，或爲遠因，其爲紗業危機之成因則一。今上海華商紗廠均於星期六星期日兩日停工，外埠則多減工百分之二十三，以期度此難關，然減工者，減少生産之一法也。紗業苦困之原因如是其複雜，而今欲用減少生産之法解除其痛苦，其非根本之計，顯然可見。　諸人身，因内部組織之不健全，外部保養之不周密，而時有積食不化之患，今若僅僅減少其飲食，必不能治其病原，或竟因此而缺乏營養，陷於　弱不治之境，其理至明，其事甚顯也。故除減工一法外，非速謀其他治本治標之策，不足以挽紗廠之厄運也。㈡絲業衰頽之原因吾國絲業失敗之原因，與紗業頗有異同。蓋紗之銷路以國内爲主，而絲之市塲則遠及國外。吾國生絲之出口，向爲大宗，自受日絲競爭後，一落千丈。年來日絲生産過剩，價格大跌，加諸人造絲充斥於市，可供代用，天然絲之銷路愈受打擊。　人之繅絲者，固不數其成本，而絲廠之倒閉，亦層見迭出，其處境之危急實在紗布業之上。夷考吾國絲業之所以衰敗，原因亦甚明顯。養　業墨守舊章，規模狹小，以致蠶繭之生産成本不能減低，此其一。土絲製法固属不良，卽廠絲这能合國外標準者，亦不多見，品質如此，銷路可知，此其二。吾國絲廠之組織，除少數外，大都根基薄弱，管理無方，甚或僅有租用廠其以圖一試者，欲求出品之有標準，又烏可得？此其三。生絲出口，均由生産者而絲棧，由絲棧而洋得，層層間接，成本自昂，獲利自微，此其四。年來日本意大利之絲業突飛猛進，海外市塲幾盡爲其所奪，此其五。國中經濟淍殘，人民購買力減低，國産絲綢銷胃不佳，此其六。舶來絲織毛織物品，源源輸入，國人歡迎，置國産絲綢於不顧，銷數因之減少，此其七。近年以來，救濟絲業之聲浪不爲不高，終以戰勝環境之困難，而鮮有成效。其收效之不易，實遠過於紗業。蓋生絲以國外爲市塲，其生絲之多寡，價格之漲落，非吾所能控制者也。（三）絲紗兩業運輸之現狀今欲挽救絲紗兩業之厄運，一方在自身之努力，一方賴政府之維護，固不待言。然此皆非本文之所欲論者。本文討論之範圍，以運輸及運價爲限，期以各種鐵道運輸方法救濟絲紗兩業於萬一。惟在籌謀救濟方法以前，不得不一究絲紗兩業現有之運輸狀况，而後能知緩急，定取捨，决從違，爰爲簡要分述如次··紗業紗業之原料爲棉花，其製品爲紗布。棉花除來自外洋者外，多産於陜西　·湖北·河南·河北·山西·山東·江西·浙江·江蘇諸省，陜西棉有由水道運滬者，有由鐵道運滬者。後者係由　海路而至徐州，經津浦京滬兩路而達上海。其由産地運至鐵道車站之費用，往往甚巨。湖北棉花大都取道長江，由漢至滬。河南之棉集中鄭州，亦有水陸现道；走水道者，由鄭運漢，沿長江至滬；取陸路者，由鄭州而徐州，沿津浦而南下。河北所産之棉，則彙集於石家莊及天津二埠，但南運者無多。魯棉則多數取道靑島，輪運至滬，但亦有經津浦·京滬·而來者。浙産之棉，或由杭州，或由平湖運滬，或由寗波運滬，　有經行滬杭　漢路者。江西棉由九江運由，多取水道。江蘇怕産者，有通州棉·太倉棉·上海棉等，鐵路所運者，固所在多有，而取道水路者亦復不少。此紗業原料運輸情形之大概也。製成之紗布運銷外埠者，如廣東·四川·天津·漢口·汕頭·厦門·九江·長沙·靑島·寗波諸地，幾全部取道水路，由報關行代各帮莊客報開起運。此外僅行銷上海附近曁徐州等處者，能爲鐵路所吸收，然爲數無多，大都係不滿整車之貨物耳。絲業絲業之原料爲蠶繭，而製品爲生絲。蠶繭産於江蘇·浙江·廣東·四川·安徽·湖北·河南·山東·湖南·廣西·河北·諸省。就中以江浙·廣東·四川·安徽·山東·等小爲巨擘。廣東·四川·山東·之繭，大都就近製絲，鮮有遠運者。江·浙·皖·三省之蠶繭，則頗多運滬製絲者。江蘇之繭，産於無錫·江陰·震澤·常州·宜興·溧陽·鎭江·通州·丹陽·如　·泰興·金壇·金山·等地，有由水路運滬者，有由京滬鐵路運滬者，然爲數遠不及浙江之多。浙繭産地甚夥，著者如嘉興·嘉善·蕭山·海寗·海鑒·諸曁·餘杭·德淸·石門·於濳·湖州·分水·硤石·南潯·奉化·嵊縣·新昌·餘姚·昌代·富陽·武康·平湖·等縣，每年由滬杭甬鐵路運出者爲數不少。皖省之繭産，遠不如江浙之富，其取道鐵路運出者，數量有限也。製成之生絲可分　種，一爲廠絲，一爲土絲。廠絲多産於上海·廣東·及四川，除四川外，直接運出外洋，無須經由鐵路輸送。由四川輸出之黃廠絲，亦多取道長江，爲鐵路所不能達。土絲之中，有白絲，黃絲，白經絲，黃經絲之分。白絲産於江浙及廣東，上海市場上之白絲，都爲江浙産，浙江著名産地爲湖州·菱湖·南潯２鳥鎭·璉市·海寗·硤石·嘉興·平湖·等地，大多數可取道滬杭甬鐵路運出。江蘇産地，以無錫·溧陽·震澤·爲最著，乃京滬鐵路通過或附近之地，一部分亦可由鐵路輸送者也。白經絲盛産於浙之南潯，蘇之震澤。黃經絲則産於四川山東及湖北，能爲鐵路所運輸者甚微也。綜上兩業之運輸情形觀之，足見紗業之原料棉花，頗有一部分利用鐵路運送者；而其製品紗布，則以取道水運者爲多，因各口岸間尙缺乏鐵路之聯貫也。絲業之原料蠶繭，則雖産於各地，而眞能運出，并經由鐵路輸送者，尚以浙繭爲巨擘，而蘇繭次之。至於絲業之製品上生絲，則廠絲大都直接由口岸輸出，與鐵路無甚關係。土絲之江浙産者，則有一部分取道鐵路，其他則均由水道輸送。由是可見鐵路運輸與絲紗兩業雖有相當關係，然皆不甚密切，欲從鐵路運輸救濟　業之困難，深恐有隔靴掻瘠之嫌。雖然，吾人在路言路，本吾盡吾心之旨，不妨就鐵路運輸之各方面，籌謀相當挽救之法，雖不能認爲收效必宏，而要不失行救濟中之一策。若能與其他根本大計相輛而爲，當亦不無促其成功之效也。（四）鐵路運輸對於救濟兩業之貢獻就鐵路運輸而謀救濟之策，則可分三方面言之··一爲運價之修訂，二爲務之改良，三爲設備之擴充。茲爲分别論列於后··㈠减輕運價鐵路之運價。原不能較運輸成本爲低，亦不能較運輸價値爲高。過低則鐵路不敗開支，過高則貨物不勝担負，均非所宜也。然運輸成本云者，有廣義狹義之分；廣義者，包括一切之費用在内；狹義者，則僅指直接之營業費而言。鐵路對於某種貨物，往往因其不能担負較高之運費，不得不照狹義的成本取費，以資吸引。今欲救濟絲紗兩業，似亦可循此原則而行，藉以輕其負担。　就棉紗繭絲四種物品之等級及運　陳述如次。（甲）棉花國有鐵路貨物分等表規定生棉花進口者爲三等，國産者爲四等。而滬杭甬路則有特價，較四等不滿整車運價加徵百分之五十五或一百。然津浦則反較普通運價减百分之四，無論整車零担均適用之。故自徐州至上海，每噸整車運價（連負責運價一成在内）須十二元一角五分。按津浦路之每噸每公里之營業直接費，約爲八釐毫，京滬約三釐四毫，若照此種狹義成本，制定原棉之運價，則自徐至上海每噸整車祇須四元，卽再加百分之五十亦僅六元而已，較諸現行運價每噸約能省廉六百有奇。（乙）棉紗棉紗　等者爲三等貨，普通者爲四等貨。雖曾有分别中外之　，卒未採用，然其意則一，因外貨多以細紗爲主也。今由上海運至南京照四等不滿整車價收費，每噸須付五元（連負責一成在内）若照該路狹義成本收費，則祇須二元一角五分。卽使再加五成，亦祇三元二角五分，較諸現有運價每噸約省一元七角五分之多。（丙）蠶繭蠶繭爲二等貨，列等甚高，盡以其質輕體大也。而滬杭甬路以蠶繭爲大示之貨運，且規定有較高之特價。例如由閘口運繭至申，即使適用二等普通零擔運價，每噸巳須八元七角五分，若按該路狹義成本（約每噸每公里五厘一毫）收費，自閘至申，每噸零擔僅一元七角五分而已。而現有之運價，適爲比數五倍有奇。（丁）生絲生絲爲二等貨，以其價値甚貴也·鐵路所運者，以东浙産之生絲爲多，故京滬滬杭甬兩路之運價，特宜加以注意。　時京滬路對於生絲訂有本路特價，即照一等運價加四倍以零擔爲限，厥後改爲二等加百分之四百。其收費之昂，不言可喻。今已將四倍之加價取銷，當可低廉甚多也。雖然鐵路之狹義的成本，僅指直接營業費而言，其他維持費，車務費，總務費，利息等等均未計入。鐵路不能坐視工商業之垂敗而不救，但亦不能因救濟工商業而自遭破産。年來各路財力空虚。尤不堪再遭摧折，今爲保全雙方起見，關於酌减運費一層，擬作下列之建議。㈠棉照各路每噸每公里之營業直接費（即狹義的成本）加五成收費。㈡紗亦照各路每噸每公里之營業直接費加五成收費㈢繭將現有之等級酌予低减定爲三等。（稿成鐵部己有改爲三等之令實與作者之意不謀而合）上述辦法，可作爲一種臨時救濟辦法，暫以若干時日爲限。一俟兩業情形較好，再行改訂可耳。㈡頒訂專價查紗廠收買國産棉花，往往由掮客而花號而花行，間或派人赴産地直接收買，因風險較大，辦理頗少。今則各廠似應團結一致，組織一種直接購棉機關，從事購買合作。再與鐵路訂立專運合同，凡鐵路可通之地，交由鐵路專運。年達規定數量以上者，得適用一種低廉之專價，較上述之物價爲尤低。至絲廠之收購蠶繭，亦同様辦理，在鐵路則化零爲整，亦不無便利可言。㈢寛放免費保管期限棉花絲繭，往往經過存棧期間，以便轉售於廠商，故貨物到站，與以相當之存棧期間，勢必另覓堆棧增加耗費。現在國有鐵路對於到達貨物，除另有規定者外，一律給以六辦公時或二十四小時水免費保管期間，自到達之時刻起算，未免太嫌短促。對於不能直接售去之貨物，尤不相宜。擬請今後將棉紗絲繭四種貨物之免費保管期間，延長至七十二小時，卽爲二十四小時之三倍，亦即三日。俾貨商得從容求售，無另覓堆棧或損耗保管費之必要，亦一减輕絲紗兩業負擔之一法也此外則擇要趕辦水陸運以及同免費保管期間之延長，及水陸聯運之擇要舉辦，因之貨棧之設備，而有擴充之必要。貨棧擴充後，則雖貨物已過免費保管期間，亦得征取低廉之保管費，任其囤存，以免另覓堆棧之煩亦减輕客商負擔之一道也。商業新聞金融洋拆又弱二分昨爲星期封關日、银行照例無收解及交易可言、市塲中洋拆亦小二分、計爲五分、早午相同拆票交易、早市轉賬四百三十餘萬、新交易九十餘萬、午市交易三十餘萬、小總會中交易四十餘萬、各路匯欵四十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收　解三千九百餘萬、因是日値比期、故收解較平常星期爲繁、辅幣江南小洋高一元、計早午市同爲八百四十八元、交易早市六千角、午市無市、廣東小洋早市爲七百七十二元五角、午市爲七百七十二元四角、結果較前日改小九角、交易早市四萬角、午市三萬角銅元三百十七千五百文與前日復同、交易四萬一千九百餘串文、早午洋拆五分五分江南八百四十八元八百四十八元廣東七百七十二元五角七百七十二元四角拆兌一二九四角五○一二九四角六○銅元三百十七千五百三百十七千五百衣牌三千一百七十五文三千一百七十五文角坯二百四十五二百四十五貼水七十二七十二證劵上週公債頻創新高價整六漲勢最猛九六交易突旺今日爲本月份期貨最後一日上週六月十九至二十四日、華商證劵交易所、爲六月份期貨買賣最後之一週、交易存賬數目、爲數雖鉅、而準備實行交割、者數量亦頗可觀、此番實行收解者、數量旣鉅、故市上傾軋之風、遂不甚劇烈、多空雙方在和平過程中、互相掉期、故市價波浪甚細、絕不若以前軋多軋空之熱烈、致有大起大落、時局方面、初則頗爲沉悶而僞軍旣未能解决、察事復尚有問題、華北情勢仍甚紊亂、人心因此稍見虚弱、祇以交割期近空方掉期亦不少、市價爲其所牽制、乃有忽高忽低、閃爍不定之象、市價雖高、已覺無力週一較爲混沌、交易最淸、市價高低互見、週二各帮似有招價之狀、空方略起恐慌頗有抵　、計漲數角至一元二角、週三多頭期、略小七八角、整六跌一元有餘、週四又有英國借欵之謠、略漲三五角、週五稍有軋空、績漲數角、九六　漲一元半、週六華北　勢未定、略跌半元左右、一週市價結果、計漲起數角至一元餘、然數雖不甚鉅、而市價本在高峯、故上週竟疊見最高新紀錄、交易亦頗熱閙、其中最堪注意者、爲整六漲勢恃勁、九六交易　旺、空穴來風、謠言卽起、惟價高則危、反動之來、當愼防之也、成交總數計共六千七百八十五萬一千五百元、内現貨五萬六千五百元、期貨統鹽稅共二千二百七十二萬、裁兵佔九百五十四萬、一九關善佔九百十四萬、廿捲廿關佔一千三百六十七萬、九六亦有五百二十五萬、餘則數十萬至二百餘萬不等、紗花外棉一致趨漲昨日美棉因旱區缺雨西部預測不佳、投機家買進而漲、結果現貨漲十磅音、期貨漲八九磅音、利物浦棉市現貨漲五點、期貨漲六七點、埃及棉市現貨漲五點、孟買棉市、先隨美棉而堅、後以日商賣出、及多頭獲利了結而跌、結果白羅溪不動、平加爾漲二角半、奥姆辣漲半羅比、原電錄左、（二十四日電）美棉比上日合國幣英棉比上日合國幣七月九四六漲九四八·五○七月五九六漲六五三·九○十月九七四八五○·○○八月五九六七五三·九○十二月九八九九五○·七○十月五九六七五三·九○一月九九八八五一·二五一月五九九七五四·二○三月一○一四九五二·○○三月六○二六五四·四○五月一○二八八五二·七○現貨六一三五五六·三○現貨九六○一○四九·一○埃及八二五五七四·六○平加爾一五五·五○漲○·二五三二·五○奥姆辣一九二·二五○·五○四○·一○白羅溪二○七·七五平四三·四○糧食米市續跌一二角（滬南）昨日來源三十餘號本街去路更見平庸、綠天時酷熱、售方以謀急脫、兼之包胃呆滯、故人心散淡、其蘇同常帮及南港厚、糧高者修削角砠、中次均跌二角之譜、杜洋尖亦小近角、客帮僅烟台帮採取靑角松江黃橋等薄稻五六百包、故價除高者疲修角砠外、餘如中關貨亦都跌落二、角陰變元亦見帶、疲常帮白更七·四○至六·九五陳墓更六·四五常帮頂更七·八五蘇州白更六·七○常帮變元八·三五至八·○五靑角特稻七·七○同里白更六·五○靑角冲稻六·七八同里洋尖七·○○靑角蘆尖六·九○至六·八五同里蘆尖六·八○至六·七○西塘薄稻六·三至六·二五吳江白更六·九五至六·四○練塘薄稻六·二○吳江羊尖七·○○航船薄稻六·九○至六·三○北　白更六·八五至六·八○貨船包胃六·八○至六·七　黎　白更六·六○至六·五○黃橋薄稻六·

<p>電影專刊女性的啓示和呐喊  胡說［女性］影片是現代世界徘徊於絶滅感復興的歧路上的一種啓示是人性向機械奮鬥自由主義向專制主義反攻的一種呐喊·不僅是一種同性戀愛淺近的故事自上古斯巴達滅亡後，普魯士便是近代嚴格紀律化的中堅·蘇俄便是現代嚴格機械化的大本營，墨索里尼和希特勒便是專制主義的魔王在這嚴格紀律化，機械化，與專制主義的統治下，人性成爲一種犧牲品。現代世界因之顯然徘徊於專制主義與自由主義兩大思潮之中。［女性］影片所發揮的含義是各個人性能否絶對的犧牲於紀律，機械化和專制主義的磨石之下。它的結論是個否字。人生性是活動的富有彈力的。人應當有相當的訓練和相當的組織，然而人性，活的人性難於永久的絶對的置於鐵的紀律死的機械之下。［女性］影片以嚴格紀律化的普魯士爲背影，影片的動作則集中於一個普魯士的女學校。面孔鐵板的女校長代表紀律化，機械化，與專制主義。好辦學校的精神是紀律，嚴格的紀律。這點也是我國太散漫太無紀律的學校應當相當的效法的。然而在這鐵的紀律下的普魯士女校裏，那一羣活潑年輕的女學生處處流露着她們不能絶滅的人性。看她們在上课的時候，或見着女校長的時候多麽嚴肅，然而在下課之後，或在女校長剛回轉身去之後，又多麽頑皮　後來·[個女學生同一位女敎員發生了同性戀愛，於是學校裏面紀律和人性兩大勢力，就發生经正面衝突。女學長以紀律責備那女敎員和女學生。兼顧人性的女敎員，就回答說愛性有種種性質和形式，像她（指女學生）這樣年齡應當有一個仰慕的目的物。一般内心潛伏着人性的女學生一齊爲那人性暴發的女同學發出擁護的共鳴。那女學生因受壓迫過甚，這女學生便爲如痴如狂·不有一般女同學的追尋，校中幾乎發生墮樓的慘劇。那不顧人性一味嚴格紀律化的女校長　悟之下·方才悄然離校。這樣自由主義，顯然佔了最後之勝利。至於這部影片的技術方面，已有專家做了許多好評·不贅影片談評評一美人情重NOMOoreorchids  凌鶴當我看了這一部中國譯名極有號召力的[美人情重]以後，我覺得有先行叙述劇情然後進行批判的必要。一個銀行家的女兒突然愛上了一個小資產者，雖然她的祖父要她嫁給一個皇子·但是她却不願意。然而爲了要救濟她父親快要倒閉的銀行，因爲她父親必須求助於她的祖父，却毅然答應祖父的意旨而絶其所愛。可是她的祖母和父親並不能忍受女兒的悲哀，决心讓有情人成了眷屬。最後是父親自殺，而以其壽命保險費救濟銀行。假如說·哥倫比亞公司的製片者能夠虚心的以金融恐慌作爲眞實而主要的主題，那末也許這部作品雖然在技巧上不一定都敎人完全滿意，可是多少總會有他存在的價値。譬如說罷，銀行家爲了企圖挽回那種難於挽救的經濟崩潰的厄運，難是自殺亦在所不惜，那末即使强制一次自己的女兒的愛情，也並不是何等罪大惡極。何况女兒嫁了皇子難道還不夠幸福嗎？所以在這裏很可以看出本片的作者對於戀愛至上主義的迷戀。同時他們又不肯敎一個理想中的銀行居然倒閉，而說是祇有自殺一途。這不僅是圖滿女兒的愛情，而且也以生命的保險費挽救了營業上的危機。所以作者的苦心，眞是可憫。很明顯的，他們作者並不以金融恐慌爲主題，最主要的是變愛的超階級性的超物質的至高無上，而眞實性的銀行倒閉不過是劇中一個關鍵而已。當然他們所創造的都是一些非現實的。現在再就事論事的來檢討導演，表葛萊泰嘉寳在倫敦的一霎那  福倫葛萊泰嘉寳在未返美國之前，曾去過一趟倫敦。她係和她的朋友渥希邁斯脫伯爵夫人一齊去的，但她却裝扮了伯爵夫人的一個侍女。她們住在倫敦一家大飯店裏，那飯店裏的侍者，亦是電影迷。他看的這位伯爵夫人的侍女，有些像那位瑞典怪明星，他就加以注意了。大槪在外國大飯店裏而住，晚上一定要將皮鞋放在門外，等侍者去刷的。這位侍者那天拿了伯爵夫人侍女的鞋去拭的時候，發見了那鞋係好萊塢某大公司的出品，於是他就斷定那位侍女一定係嘉寳裝扮的。這個消息如同野火般傳了出去，新聞記者們的鼻子眞靈，他們如同獵犬尋到了野味似的，聚攏起來。但是他們到了飯店裏，伯爵夫人和她的侍女，已經上了船到法國去了。他們撲了一個空，並且歎息嘉寳的鼻子比他們的還要尖演及其他方面首先我們不滿意的便是導演的調度失當。就上述的故事而論，假如能夠以沉痛情調的悲劇形式演出，也許本片會因此獲一部份的眞價。即使我們相信了在現實社會中還有情願犧牲皇子夫人的地位而屈身於一平凡男子的女性，那末這銀行家女兒一定是别具慧眼的所謂神秘的人物，好有着不平凡的熱情，同時這一男性也是在金錢的條件之外而另有一種魔力攫住了她的心。但是這一節劇中沒有熱戀的塲面，都是平凡的普通情愛的描寫，而且男性也似乎是視愛情爲身外物的，陜了鍜練着體格一無所長。其後她爲了拯救父親而决心埋葬自己的愛情，那末這時内心的痛苦一定使她戀態的瘋狂。可是劇中又不如此，一點也看不出她的特殊情感。所以本劇的缺點·除了故事結構上的各點之外，便是導演對於劇情沒有充分的把握。全篇是快樂的情調，連那一個終於自殺的父殺也充分流露着快樂的人生。以喜劇的形式來配合沉痛的劇情，究竟是最容易失敗的了。至於情調上的鬆懈，自然導演必然的結果。當然我們並不說凡是[緊張]者都是美國的成功作品·可是本片如能以緊凑而沉痛的情調演出·一定會多少獲得成效。如上所述，那末便决了主角CaroleLombaId表演的運。也許她並不擅悲劇，即就她在本片中如此快樂的表演亦不見何等特殊風味。主要的缺乏面部表演情。假如這種角色以瑙瑪奇拉擔任，一定很爲動人。主角配角中除飾父親頗爲認眞之外，其外諸人均不足稱道。攝影佈景各方面不見破綻亦不見精采。整個的都是平平而已。野貓主演漁光曲  佈景板銀幕上這一頭野貓丨王人美，好久沒有她的消息了。野貓那副天眞爛漫和蹤蹤跳跳的形像，留在我們的腦際，始終不能磨滅丨她是勞動者的靈魂，她會使辛苦到了極點的人快樂，她眞是一頭很好的野貓。野貓是瀏陽人，今年還只有二十歲，平時··她總是像小孩子一般的嘻嘻哈哈笑着。她不歡喜如時下女星一樣的奢華，她身上不需要綢緞與脂粉，只需要國產布。她雖然因條件不合出了聯華，但是··蔡楚生那部[漁光曲]却請她主演，大槪商量結果，野貓總不致於不答應吧丨天一拍他們的靈魂太康天一公司近因出品過於遲緩，故現在特積極羅致人才。此後對於出品上·每月至少出影片二部至三部。而以後不再單拍有聲片，採取無聲與有聲并兼制。該公司屢接内地各埠戲院來函，要求該公司拍無聲影片，因内地戲院有聲放映機者尙少故也。現該公司在拍攝中之影片·有[前進]，[飛絮]兩片俱爲無聲，及有聲片，一他們的靈魂]。按[他們的靈魂]的劇本，係外間所投。導演爲邵醉翁，陳玉梅主演·袁美雲·陸麗霞等合演。陳玉梅之[掙扎]  星星丨已由李一鶴携京檢查丨陳玉梅演[生機]方竣，接連又即被任[掙扎]主角。按[生機]由邵醉翁導演，乃一以婦女出路爲題材的影片，[掙扎]原名[黃昏]，由裘芑香導演，片述一農女與一靑年之一叚戀愛式奮鬥故事，爲環塡而奮鬥，爲生活而奮鬥，爲出路而奮鬥，最後挿以一二八滬戰事件，此靑年即投身便衣隊，卒爲羣衆與　家之奮鬥，光榮而死，全劇意識極强烈，結構頗緊張。此片現已攝竣，即由該公司發行部職員李一鶴君携京檢查，公映期當不遠也。影訊二則  周敬之（一）明星公司的[滿江紅]可說是繼[脂粉市場]後的大傑作。戲開拍到現在已經快將完竣，惟外景却需要拍攝，前數天由導演程步高率領着一行人員赴蘇州拍攝外景。這次女明星去的計有，電影皇后胡蝶·嚴月閒，朱秋痕，等。這許多美麗明星光臨到蘇州，該地人士誠可爲蓬蓽生輝，眼福不淺。現一行人已反滬上了。（二）蔡楚生的[漁光曲]，好久便預備開拍，可是因爲男主角高占非的關係而躭擱到了現在，聽說高占非已返滬了，（聯合公司的合同雖未滿期，但他的戲已拍完了。）預料漁光曲開拍之期即將開始云。電影小說關睢之歌TheSongotSongs（二）  思蘋瑪琍黛特藜希主演派拉蒙出品描寫孤女求戀所遇非人的痛史藜莉又是獨自一個了，她把面龐緊貼着窗子向外看，但見街心燈光搖曳。[柏林呀丨]她柔媚地艶羨地喊了一聲。街過邊光亮的大玻璃窗裏隱約顯露出一家雕刻室。用布包着的石像散雜陳列着。瞥見一人跑過窗，一忽兒不見了。藜莉拾起聖經鑽入被　。藜莉柔聲背誦着關睢之歌。藜莉自從寄居在她姑母家裏之後，雖覺寂寞寡歡，有淚無處洒，但仍强作歡笑幫助姑母在書店工作。一日，好蹲在高凳上揩拭玻璃窗，有一少年從雕刻室遇街跑來。他身體瘦長，面容和藹可親。藜莉隔窗注視着他。她心猿意馬地猜他呌什麽名字，他會不會跑到店裏來。他停了步看一孩童堆雪人。他又傴着身去替那孩童修飾　。他抬起身來，剛要轉去，他的眼睛然在同藜莉凝視着的媚眼相遇。他走近窗邊，隔着被她呵氣吹得糊塗的玻璃對她微笑。她把玻璃揩拭乾凈的時候，他已去了。門鈴一響，書店門開了。藜莉在高凳上旋轉身子張望進來的誰。就是他呀！她便端莊着問他有何見敎。他驚喜交集地端詳她美麗的姿態，呌他不要動。但是藜莉却堅持着莊重的形態爬了下來，問他要買書嗎。那少年一口氣說可惜她糟塌了，問她來了多久。藜莉不知不覺的歎口氣說來此已兩月了。那少年驚奇地說怎麽沒有見過她，一面告訴她他名呌華爾獨，是她的隣居，他的雕刻室就在對門。他又問她店裏的老妖怪在那裏。藜莉身不由主的笑了一笑，說她上市去了。那少年纔放心問她曉不曉得她姿首姘艶。他說要替她鐫一鋼像，說她天生麗質，須出他手筆，然後能相得益彰，問她是否有意。藜莉問他究竟要不要買書，又說素昧平生說那套話發痴。他笑着說他也不認識她，不過是一心要替她刻像。他又說他不是替隨便什麽女人雕刻的，惟對美人不肯輕易放過的，問她今夜可否降臨。藜莉搖頭說否，却仍是身不由主的對他笑。（未完）</p>

<p>Chiang Responds to He's Telegram, Deciding to Appoint Sun as the Commissioner of Qinghai New Reclamation</p>
<h3>Fang Zhenwu Leads Troops to Depart, Liu Guitang Negotiates Surrender</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang sent representatives from Zhangjiakou to Beiping to visit Song Zheyuan, Qin Dechun, and others, expressing a more sincere attitude than before. The hope for peace, which had been stalled, has some room for recovery. If necessary, Song will send Zhang Jiyong and others to Zhangjiakou three times for a final mediation. As for the central government hoping that Feng would leave Zhangjiakou, the mediators have no way to suggest this to Feng, only to prepare houses in Wanquan and let Feng choose a place to live, without restricting his freedom. Feng's representatives are still in Beiping negotiating with all parties. (25th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The central government's reply telegram regarding the method of resolving the Chahar situation has arrived, still advocating peaceful resolution. All parties also believe that although the Chahar situation has become deadlocked, they still hope it will not lead to a breakdown. Song Zheyuan is currently still working hard to mediate. (25th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Chahar Bureau issue, after the Beiping authorities and Song telegraphed the central government for instructions yesterday, the Jing and Gan sides have not yet sent reply telegrams to Beiping this morning, thus forming a standstill. Song gathered Qin Dechun, Zhang Jiyong, etc., at his private residence this morning for a two-hour meeting, but there were still no results. He Yingqin is scheduled to convene a discussion with all the generals related to the Chahar Bureau again tonight to discuss everything. (25th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding Sun Dianying's transfer to Qinghai for reclamation, He Yingqin repeatedly telegraphed the central government and Chiang Kai-shek to request a clear order for announcement. Today, a reply telegram from Chiang was received, and the central government has decided to appoint Sun as the Commissioner of Qinghai New Border Region Reclamation. It is expected that the Political Council will approve it this week, and it can be officially announced. Sun, after receiving the government's clear order, will lead his troops westward from Shacheng, concentrate in Baotou along the Ping-Sui Railway, and move along the Bao-Ning Avenue.

<p>Between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan</p>
<h3>International Train Decided Not to Run</h3>
<p>Qian Zongze Sends Representatives to Negotiate with the Japanese Side on the Issue of Traffic</p>
<p>Negotiations on the Handling of Puppet Troops Are Underway</p>
<h3>Puppet Troops in Tangshan Prepare to Withdraw</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The international train between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan will not run because of the Japanese side's inconsistency. One engineering train and one traffic train are currently being prepared. The director of the transportation department, Si Tiru, leads more than 20 road mechanics and workers to Tangshan and Luozhou first. As soon as the puppet troops withdraw, passenger and freight cars will be opened to Luozhou. Qian Zongze, the director of the Beining Railway Bureau, sent Chief Secretary Gu on a special train to Tanggu on the 24th. He changed to a Japanese military transport ship to Dagu Estuary and boarded a Japanese warship to negotiate traffic matters with a representative of the Kwantung Army. The representative promised to have the puppet troops withdraw from Tangshan first, then from Luozhou. Mr. Gu and the representative took a special train from Tanggu to Beiping at 6 p.m. on the 15th. When the special train passed through Tianjin, Qian Zongze also boarded the train to go together. According to traffic sources, the puppet troops in Tangshan are preparing to withdraw. (25th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Qian Zongze and Gu Chengzeng arrived in Beiping at 10:30 tonight and went to Jurentang to meet He Yingqin to report on the negotiation with the Japanese representative in Dagu regarding the withdrawal of the puppet troops from Luodong and the opening of the Beining Railway. (25th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the Railway Bureau, only the section between Tianjin and Tanggu of the Beining Railway is still operating normally. The number of trains between Tanggu and Lutai has been reduced. The section from Lutai to Tangshan is currently occupied by puppet troops and has long been closed. The section from Tangshan to Shanhaiguan is in the Japanese occupied area and is currently managed by the puppet Fengshan Railway Bureau. The number of trains is also restricted. Therefore, railway traffic between Tianjin and Tangshan, Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan has actually been cut off. Tianjin's commercial losses are huge. Not only is the income of the Beining Railway Bureau affected, but Tianjin, which cannot repay its debts, may face a shortage of coal throughout the city. The Tianjin consulates believe that the development of this situation affects the business of various countries in North China and will raise the issue of restoring traffic on the Beining Railway based on the Boxer Protocol.

<p>(Beiping) Yongjin, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, has gone to Changchun to meet with Mutō and has not yet returned to Beiping. Therefore, there is still no clue as to how to resolve the puppet troops. The Japanese side intends to delay the situation in Luodong in order to cultivate a special force of puppet troops such as Li Jichun and others to occupy various counties, forming a disguised demilitarized zone for a long time. The Chinese side is waiting for the Japanese side's reply before starting to resolve the matter. (25th Special Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The authorities are currently keeping the handling of the puppet troops issue strictly confidential. Urgent negotiations are reportedly underway. Colonel Yongjin, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, has gone to Changchun for this matter. Beiping is also discussing it, but the results are not yet known. However, many believe that the Japanese side is still insisting that Li Jichun's puppet troops should remain stationed on the Beining Railway. (25th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>The Earth Dam in Xiaguan is Gradually Collapsing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The river water is rising sharply and unabated. Although Nanjing has been very hot for the past two days, the water level along the river is still rising due to the influence of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. According to Hu Weiyuan, an official from the Xiaguan Office of the Public Works Bureau, today is one of the largest tides in a month. The river water is rising very strongly, and it is affected by the southwest wind. Coupled with the surge from the upper reaches, the earth dam is gradually collapsing. At 2 p.m. on the 25th, the earth dam from the Mobil Oil Street to the Sun Yat-sen Pier suddenly showed signs of collapse in Jiujiawan. Although the river water was low and did not rush in, the dangerous situation was very serious. The Public Works Bureau ordered Xiaguan to complete the construction that night and notified more than 1,000 households in the area to send one person per household to help block it. At 6 p.m., the lowest layer of the dam was filled with straw, soil, and mud. It was found that the cracks in this breach were about 200 meters long. 2,000 hemp bags and more than 20 zhang of foreign pine wood piles have been prepared, and 200 workers have been transferred from the city to rush to the site to build. It is scheduled to be repaired completely before 12 o'clock that night. The Nanjing flood 20 years ago was caused by this breach, and the river water flowed in, causing great damage, so we must make every effort to block it. (25th Special Telegram)</p>
<h3>Headquarters Urges Flood Prevention Work</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The headquarters, according to the report of Xi Dejiong, said that dikes are vital to Hubei Province. At this time of rising water levels, we should strengthen prevention to avoid negligence in rescue work. All levels of personnel should have the same determination and be serious about their duties. They should be diligent, cautious, and agile in surveying dikes, patrolling, reporting dangers, and recruiting laborers, without the slightest negligence. If the water level rises sharply, they will personally supervise the dikes and bravely rush to the rescue in case of emergency, following orders as if they were in the military and not allowing retreat. In recent days, as the water level has risen, some flood prevention officials have asked for leave and resigned, hoping to avoid responsibility. The Jianghan Engineering Bureau and the Provincial Government have been ordered to strictly prohibit this to emphasize the importance of dikes. (25th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>Banque Industrielle de Chine</p>
<h3>Protest of the Liquidation Office</h3>
<p>Zhu Boquan Declares to the Russian and Japanese Ministers</p>
<p>Any Disposition of the Chinese Eastern Railway is Invalid</p>
<p>Zhu Boquan, the liquidator of the Banque Industrielle de Chine in China, protested because the talks on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway by Soviet Russia were about to begin within days. He submitted a protest a few days ago and sent it to the Soviet Russian Ambassador Bogomolov and the Japanese Minister Ariyoshi Akira. The content roughly stated: For the protest, the liquidator of the Banque Industrielle de Chine in China respectfully requests that Your Excellency forward the following protest to your government. According to the contract signed with the Chinese government on September 8, 1896, the Banque Industrielle de Chine was the original transferee of the concession for the construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway. In order to implement the aforementioned contract and in accordance with the charter approved by the Imperial Russian government on December 18, 1896, the Chinese Eastern Railway Company was organized, with a total capital of 5 million gold rubles, all of which was borne by the Banque Industrielle de Chine. Since then, the bank has become the owner and holder of all the railway stock certificates. Subsequently, on May 21, 1924, the Chinese and Soviet governments signed the Beijing Agreement, agreeing on several principles for the Chinese Eastern Railway, and stipulating in Section 4 of Article 9 that "the Soviet government agrees to be responsible for all claims of shareholders, bondholders, and creditors of the Chinese Eastern Railway before the revolution of March 9, 1917." This provision clearly implies that the Soviet government recognizes the Banque Industrielle de Chine as the holder of the Chinese Eastern Railway Company's shares and understands that it will compensate the Banque Industrielle de Chine after the Chinese and Soviet governments take over the railway. By September 25, 1926, the Banque Industrielle de Chine ceased operations. On September 30, the Chinese government ordered the organization of a Liquidation Office to liquidate the bank in China, and this liquidator is the currently legally appointed director of the Liquidation Office. The responsibilities of the Liquidation Office, in accordance with Article 6 of the Liquidation Regulations, are to receive the assets of the Banque Industrielle de Chine in China and distribute them to the various creditors. Now that the Soviet government has neither fulfilled its promise to pay the Banque Industrielle de Chine as the holder of the Chinese Eastern Railway Company's shares, nor has it officially announced that it is negotiating the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway with the authorities of the so-called "Manchukuo" through the mediation of the Japanese government, this Liquidation Office, for the benefit of the bank's creditors, asks the Soviet government to first resolve the issue of compensation for the Banque Industrielle de Chine, the shareholder of the Chinese Eastern Railway, and warns the Soviet government that if it disregards this protest, any sale or other disposition of the Chinese Eastern Railway will not be considered valid (this warning does not preclude other objections raised by the Chinese government). The content sent to the Japanese Embassy is completely the same. (National Daily)</p>

<h3>Post-Disaster Relief for Floods</h3>
<p>Ming</p>
<p>Among the most severe water disasters in our country over the past two thousand years, none compares to the Yellow River. Its breaches mostly occur from Luoyang to Shandong. Every summer, residents along the river live in constant fear. In the early Qing dynasty, a Director-General of River Works was appointed to specifically manage river projects, but this did little to alleviate the flooding. Even today, the Yellow River's water disasters have not only persisted but have become even more rampant than before. Areas east of Zhengzhou, including Kaifeng, Kaocheng, and even Dong'e, Changqing, and Qihe in Shandong, not only fail to benefit from irrigation but are constantly threatened by floods. As a result, many types of plants can no longer be cultivated in the areas near Kaifeng, posing a significant risk of desertification. Examining the current situation and tracing back to ancient times, the Yellow River basin was once the center of our country's civilization, and the Chinese nation benefited from the Yellow River's cultivation. How did it decline to such a state? What is the root cause? Setting aside political factors for now, let us focus solely on economic reasons. Human destruction is the primary factor. For example, in water management, for over four thousand years, apart from Yu the Great, who implemented dredging, those in positions of power primarily advocated for obstruction. They only knew to raise embankments to control the water. Consequently, the embankments grew higher and higher, slowing the water flow. For example, the Yellow River embankment near Kaifeng is more than ten feet higher than the city walls. However, the construction of embankments continues to increase annually, leading to a major flood every fifty to seventy years. As for those of lower rank, they only focus on short-term gains, which is even less worth mentioning. In recent times, our country's political center has shifted south to the Yangtze River basin, and the economic mainstream has also shifted to the Yangtze River. The water disasters seem to have followed politics and economics to the Yangtze River as well. The massive flood of the previous year nearly affected every province along the Yangtze River, and the vitality of rural areas has yet to recover. This year, only during the plum rain season, which is not the true flood season, the Hankou water level has already reached forty-seven feet, an unprecedented phenomenon in the past hundred years. If the water continues to rise unabated, the Jianghan region will inevitably become a vast swamp. How will farmers survive in the future? Those who talk about disaster relief prioritize flood control, followed by repairing embankments, and then providing aid to refugees. These policies are indeed urgent tasks, but they only offer temporary relief and are not fundamental solutions. The upper reaches of the current Yangtze River are mostly stone beds, unlike the Yellow River, which carries a lot of sediment. If we allow it to develop naturally without considering dredging, and continue to build dams along the river to reclaim farmland, large areas like Dongting Lake and Poyang Lake, and smaller areas like Hong Lake, Cao Lake, and Weiyuan Lake, are mostly limited in their water storage capacity by human intervention. They are used for farmland reclamation without attention to dredging, which is repeating the mistakes of the Yellow River. The tighter the embankments, the more difficult the river flow becomes. Once the rainfall is slightly higher, the excess water has nowhere to go, leading to overflow and breaches, causing floods everywhere.</p>
<p>Now that the disaster has already occurred, Wuhan is almost entirely flooded. Temporary relief efforts cannot be delayed, but for fundamental relief, we should not only focus on building new embankments but also on actively dredging the Yangtze River. Building new embankments can only provide temporary peace for a few years, while dredging can fundamentally eliminate disasters. However, this is a major undertaking that requires a long period, a far-sighted plan, and an unwavering spirit of perseverance to achieve. It should be considered a major national project for the next hundred years, and we should not hesitate to make this enormous sacrifice to lay the foundation for the future. The Yangtze River has a long source and a slow flow downstream from Yichang. The riverbed is prone to siltation, and the banks become alluvial lands, making it easier to cause floods. The method of building embankments to prevent floods is no longer suitable, and reservoirs are indispensable. Therefore, in addition to the dredging of the Yangtze River itself, all large and small lakes such as Dongting Lake, Poyang Lake, Cao Lake, and Tangjia Lake must also be dredged to ensure that they can store large amounts of mountain floods that cannot reach the sea immediately. Only then can water disasters be eliminated. Otherwise, in less than a hundred years, the Yangtze River will follow in the footsteps of the Yellow River and become a major disaster for China.</p>

The proposal by the US representative to reduce wheat production by 15% has been endorsed by Canada and Argentina. However, Australia's response is still unknown. The subcommittee on production and marketing of the World Economic Conference will receive the report from its drafting committee before meeting on Monday. The report outlines the following principles that must be followed in commodity agreements: (1) The commodity for which production and marketing are harmonized must be one of the world's important commodities, and its production or inventory must exceed demand, requiring special concerted action. (2) Any measure must have detailed regulations for the commodity to be adjusted and the producers themselves. (3) If necessary or needed, cooperation from non-producing but exporting countries should be stipulated to ensure the success of the plan. (4) Any measure must consider the interests of both producers and consumers, showing fairness. Its purpose is to seek and maintain fair and profitable prices, without harming any country. Such measures should be implemented with the willing cooperation of the consumer side of the importing country, as consumers have the same interest as producers in maintaining adequate supply and stable prices. (5) The measure should be administratively feasible. (6) It should have a sufficient duration. (7) Adequate attention should be paid to the need to promote efficient production in various countries.

<h3>Hull Issues Formal Statement</h3>
<p>Opinions Not Opposed to President Roosevelt's</p>
<p>US Plans Align with International Cooperation (London) Lately, there has been a widespread belief in Europe that the US President and Secretary of State Hull have conflicting views on the plans for the economic conference. To dispel this notion, Hull issued a formal statement today, saying that such a notion could hinder the full realization of the conference's hopes. The current process of international cooperation is not incompatible with the US domestic plans to reduce unemployment and raise prices. Rumors of internal differences within the delegation could greatly hinder the progress of the conference. Raising prices to protect economic interests is necessary for all countries. Therefore, regardless of the plan adopted to improve the situation, all those who want to increase prices and engage in international cooperation in trade should be given the fullest support. Countries may adopt different plans to raise prices, but if their plans are sound, they should be generally supported. The level of international cooperation should be expanded to harmonize these plans so that they can work together to promote the revival of trade. Hull then responded to the newspaper's claim that he intended to resign due to a severe conflict with the President, saying that the tariff proposals submitted by the United States to the conference were all drafted in Washington before the opening of the conference, and nothing has happened between here and Washington to change this situation. The US delegation believes that the rumor that the US President and Secretary of State have conflicting views is due to the US government initially including the issue of currency stabilization in the conference's agenda and then refusing to join the temporary agreement to stabilize currency prices.

<h3>France's Firm Stance</h3>
<p>Pessimistic About the Future of the Conference</p>
<p>(Paris) French Finance Minister Bonnet reported on Friday on the progress of the World Economic Conference, including the French government's attitude towards the World Economic Conference. In a nutshell, he said that if various agreements can only take effect after exchange rate stability, then France is prepared to continue cooperation in the economic sphere. Although the authorities issued a statement declaring that the cabinet unanimously agreed with Bonnet's remarks, it is said that the French government is not very optimistic about the outcome of the conference. The French government will still strongly advocate for the stability of the pound and the dollar, considering this the sole foundation for all construction of the conference. France's withdrawal from the conference is not a problem, but the general public believes that the continued meetings of the conference are a waste of time. The opposition party in the Chamber of Deputies has proposed a motion arguing that the French government should apply for the conference to be postponed until non-gold standard currencies have been firmly stabilized. This motion is unlikely to pass, but it is significant in expressing its position. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<h3>Italian Public Opinion Also Pessimistic</h3>
<p>MacDonald's Optimism Does Not Match Reality</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian public opinion has little hope for the London Economic Conference, viewing it as unable to achieve practical results. A month before the opening of the economic conference, Italians were quite skeptical, saying that such a conference, gathering representatives from sixty countries in one hall, speaking endlessly, how could it be effective? Later, the signing of the Four-Power Pact led some to believe that the spirit of the London Conference was the same as it, or that the economic conference could be effective due to the establishment of the pact. Italians also said that the attitude taken by the United States recently is very disappointing. "Stampa" talked about the British Prime Minister MacDonald's recent declaration on the economic conference, saying that this declaration is nothing more than a "shot of optimism, which only shows MacDonald's optimism and does not correspond to the truth." The same newspaper also said that the subcommittees set up by the economic conference are so numerous that it is impossible to distinguish them. The conference had to list the various committees in a diagram for the reference of journalists. Several newspapers also published a piece of news with great satisfaction, saying that the passive attitude of the United States will promote the economic integration of European countries. Italy only recognizes this integration as a last resort but is unwilling to oppose it. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<h3>Germany Rejects Russian Protest</h3>
<p>Russian Newspaper Discusses Hugenberg Incident Again</p>
<p>(Berlin) The Soviet Union protested to Germany because the German representative Hugenberg submitted a memorandum to the World Economic Conference, saying that Russian Asian land was suitable for German colonization. However, the German Foreign Ministry has now rejected this protest, saying that there is nothing in Hugenberg's memorandum that can be protested. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Although the Soviet government has formally protested Hugenberg's memorandum to the World Economic Conference because it suggested that Soviet territory could be used for German colonization, the Soviet press initially did not mention the German government's denial and slightly relaxed its commentary. This Soviet public opinion was not misled by the German government's denial, as expressed by "Izvestia." The newspaper pointed out that Dr. Hugenberg was not a private individual but the German Minister of National Economy. His being sent to London was not like a scientist attending a scientific conference, but as a member of the German delegation participating in the World Economic Conference. The conference wanted to hear the official views of the government represented by the representatives, not personal opinions. The newspaper also detailed a document published by the German Foreign Ministry's official newspaper "German Foreign Policy Communication" regarding Hugenberg's memorandum, saying, "If Mr. Hugenberg did not formally raise the issue of colonizing Eastern Europe and especially colonizing Soviet territory, why should he state that this is purely his personal view?" Izvestia continued, "In politics, we must measure facts that exceed declarations." Here, the newspaper mentioned the anti-Soviet negotiations conducted by Dr. Rosenberg, the diplomatic advisor to Hitler. The newspaper also discussed the declaration published by the Nazi Party's official newspaper "People's Observer," which meant that if British conservatives could pay a considerable price, the Nazi Party would be prepared to openly provoke the Soviet Union. Izvestia concluded, "The Soviet public's strong aversion to Hugenberg's memorandum is aroused by the anti-Soviet nature of the document. For the past ten years, German fascism has been carrying out propaganda to prepare for intervention in the Soviet Union. It has proposed its plan to divide Soviet territory, and since the Nazi Party gained power, various declarations of willingness to maintain German-Russian relations in the spirit of the Rapallo and Berlin Treaties have not prevented the expansion of anti-Soviet propaganda, nor have they prevented Hugenberg from proposing his intervention plan."

<h3>India's Tariff Policy</h3>
<p>Conditionally Agrees to Reduce Tariffs</p>
<p>(London) The Indian delegation issued a memorandum tonight, stating that India is prepared to join any declaration passed by the World Economic Conference that explains the need to reduce tariffs, but for practical financial reasons, the date and extent of tariff reduction must be determined by the government with tariffs. As for future measures, the Indian delegation welcomes the conference's declaration of the importance of tariff policy not being aimed at protecting industries. Regarding the exercise of the right to increase tariffs in response to changes, the Indian delegation is prepared to agree to negotiations by the countries concerned whenever possible to find ways to eliminate difficulties and avoid using tariff tools.

<h3>Japan Plans New Tariff System</h3>
<p>Will It Counterattack in the Economic War?</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Recently, the economic struggle between countries has gradually intensified. Countries are adopting extreme nationalistic policies to reform existing trade treaties. Japan's current tariff system was formulated when it restored tariff autonomy during the Meiji era and is very immature compared to European and American countries. Its shortcomings are threefold: (1) The current system has almost no nationalistic cartel tariff characteristics, so its tax rate is quite low compared to European and American countries. (2) The current system is not completely resistant to preventing foreign goods from dumping policies. The need to reform tariffs has been repeatedly felt, but because there are no such regulations in the tariff rate law, it has not been realized. (3) Because retaliatory measures against foreign government tariff wars are bound by existing trade treaties, it is inconvenient to apply this situation, which is equivalent to being powerless in international economic warfare. After the British economic alliance recently raised tariffs on Japan, Japanese officials and the public were greatly shocked by the lack of preparation and incompleteness of the Japanese system. Japanese authorities, because most of the various trade treaties are about to expire, are aware of the economic war in future treaty negotiations, abandon the idea of consultation, and are determined to establish a fundamental tariff system. Now that the World Economic Conference is discussing ways to remove various obstacles to trade, the government will organize a council composed of the Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and Ministry of Colonial Affairs to study the new system of tariffs based on the results of the economic conference. (United News, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Privy Council of Japan met yesterday morning to deliberate on the inquiry on the tariff truce agreement. Three advisors, Suemasa, Kawai, and Kubota, questioned Foreign Minister Uchida, saying (1) What kind of benefits does Japan get from participating in this agreement? (2) The conditions reserved by various countries are very numerous, and the reason for participation is almost eliminated. (3) Can retaliatory measures be limited to trade measures? (4) What are the contents of the reserved conditions of India and other participating countries? Foreign Minister Uchida replied that retaliatory measures can only be used in domestic legal systems. It can also be said that there is no need to worry about the countries that are subject to the agreement. If they express something unfavorable to Japan, the government can protest. The Privy Council has approved the original plan. According to reports, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a statement participating in the agreement, the main points of which are (1) For participating countries with reserved conditions, Japan believes that this agreement cannot take effect between Japan and these countries. (2) During the agreement period, the Japanese government still maintains the right of self-defense. (3) For countries other than the signatory countries to the agreement, the Japanese government retains the freedom of tariffs. (China United Press, 25th) (Tokyo) Regarding the Japan-India Trade Treaty issue, a divergence of opinion has arisen between the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the commercial groups. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is urging its representatives abroad to contact the British and Indian governments to resolve the dispute through diplomatic means. However, the commercial groups advocate boycotts to make the British and Indian governments repent and restore the original treaty. There is no need to yield to seek temporary peace and lose permanent benefits. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Commerce and Industry will hold meetings every day for a week starting tomorrow to deliberate on the countermeasures for the negotiations with India with the Japanese merchants. It is heard that the Ministry of Commerce and Industry advocates restoring the original treaty and abolishing the Indian Industrial Protection Law as the goal. If this goal cannot be achieved, then a new trade agreement will be signed, specifying the goods and mutually guaranteeing their import and export quantities, and abandoning the dumping policy. Commerce Minister Nakajima will meet with the chairman of the Textile Federation tomorrow to discuss this matter. (China United Press, 25th)</p>

<p>Japan's Next Year's Budget</p>
<h3>Will Exceed 2.3 Billion Yen</h3>
<p>Army Expenses Break Through 600 Million Yen</p>
<p>(Tokyo) As usual, the provinces have made new requests to the Ministry of Finance due to the emergency. However, no matter how much the Ministry of Finance reduces, it seems to be the same as this year, and the total budget will exceed 2.3 billion. The expansion of expenditure has become chronic. However, the biggest reasons for the budget expansion are the independence of the special accounting of the communication business, the emergency rescue expenses, the Manchurian Incident expenses, the exchange rate loss, and the national defense expenses of the army and navy. Military expenses are the biggest difficulty in preparing the budget. (Dentsu, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Ministry deliberated on the budget yesterday afternoon. The first review has been completed, and it has been decided to organize the fixed numbers on the 25th and 26th. The second review will begin on the 27th. The meeting adjourned at 6 pm. Whether the full amount of 250 million yen for the material reorganization fee will be included in the 9th year, or whether it will be divided into two years, 9th and 10th years, remains to be seen in the second review. However, it is said that the current target has broken through 600 million yen. (Dentsu, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The general account's budget estimate requests from each province for compiling next year's budget are limited to the end of July, and the special account is limited to the end of August to submit to the Budget Bureau of the Ministry of Finance. However, the compilation policy of the Ministry of Finance is as follows: (1) The approval of new businesses is limited to emergency expenses, and the appropriateness and effectiveness of its use must be carefully reviewed. (2) The emergency rescue expenses are a fixed policy that will continue for three years. Recently, the rural situation has seen some easing, so the rescue expenses can also be slightly reduced. (3) The Manchurian Incident expenses can also be slightly reduced starting this year because Rehe has been pacified and the ceasefire agreement has also been established. (4) The navy's second replenishment plan and the army's material reorganization fee are related to the overall national defense situation, and the political resolution of the Ministry of Finance and the military must be waited for. (5) Some tax increases can be expected, but the issuance of deficit bonds is inevitable. However, the tax increase is the plan of the Tax System Revision Preparation Committee, so the tax increase is to fill the deficit. (Dentsu, 25th)</p>
<p>Japanese Young Army Officers Plot</p>
<h3>Republic of North China Theory</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the news obtained by our special correspondent, the young and middle-aged officers in the Army Department and the Kwantung Army are very dissatisfied with the ceasefire agreement, saying that they have given up the great opportunity to implement the mainland policy and do not obey the control of Commander Mutō. They arbitrarily do what they want, vigorously assist the rebel armies of Li Jichun and Ding Qiang, etc., incite the bandits who were reorganized in rebellion, expand their military strength, occupy Hebei Province, and seek opportunities to declare the organization of the Autonomous Republic of North China. However, it has been resolved to welcome Puyi and merge with the pseudo "Manchukuo." Since the North China Ceasefire Agreement, it has been nearly a month so far. The problem of the puppet army has not yet been resolved, and the Japanese army has also withdrawn. This is because Commander Mutō has no ability to control the internal departments.

<h3>Japan Establishes Manchuria-Mongolia Bureau</h3>
<p>Armed Immigration Plan of 1,000 People</p>
<p>Difficulty in Implementing Due to Financial Reasons</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In view of the complexity and importance of Japan-Manchuria relations, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs is currently planning to establish the Manchuria-Mongolia Bureau and enrich the content of the Changchun Office to implement its policy towards Manchuria. It will also change the number of armed immigrants to Manchuria from 500 to 1,000 and move 500,000 people to Manchuria within 15 years. However, this plan of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs is related to finance, and its realization seems to be difficult. (United News, 25th)</p>

<h3>Conspiracy to Assassinate Zaibatsu</h3>
<p>Dentsu Tokyo, 25th A man with suspicious behavior was arrested by the Minami-Senju police station on the night of the 15th. As a result of the investigation, according to his confession, he had planned to assassinate the financial giants Ginjiro Fujiwara and Heisaburo Okawa and destroy the Chamber of Commerce and Industry. He is from Fukuoka Prefecture, named Kai Ogami, 38 years old. In the eleventh year of Taisho, he joined the Yamato Labor Association and then transferred to the prison rooms of Hokkaido and Sakhalin. Later, the May 15 Incident occurred, and he was deeply stimulated. He witnessed the Sakhalin workers suffering all kinds of abuse, and the zaibatsu filled their own pockets. He was very indignant, so he made bombs and wanted to carry out the above-mentioned conspiracy. Recently, because the world has calmed down, he decided to stop, and the bombs have been thrown into the Uzutagawa River.</p>

<p>Japanese Puppets Use Tricks</p>
<h3>Buy Over Mongolian Hearts</h3>
<p>Issuing Loans and Exempting Miscellaneous Taxes</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to people related to Mongolian and Tibetan affairs, since the establishment of a puppet state, Eastern Mongolia has fallen into a war zone, and people have fled, lost their jobs, and suffered unspeakable misery. Japanese puppets are buying over Mongolian hearts, chanting the slogan of rescuing the Mongolians, and issuing loans of 120,000 yuan or 60,000 yuan in gold notes to each banner at an annual interest rate of 6%. The distribution method is based on the amount of land, 20 yuan for every 10 mu of land. Now, various banners have sent personnel to Jilin, Liaoyuan and other places, intending to go to Changchun to receive them. 2. The puppet state is about to divide Rehe Province and the Josutu League and the Zhaowuda League into three provinces. The method of division is to redivide the counties and banner police districts. The counties are under the jurisdiction of Rehe, and the banners are under the jurisdiction of the new provinces of the Josutu and Zhaowuda Leagues. 3. The puppet state has appointed Shou Minga, the Director of Political Affairs of the Xing'an General Administration, and four others as members of the preparatory committee for the Josutu and Zhaowuda Leagues. Shou and the others are now at the Zhaowuda League's League Chief's Office, working on dividing the county and banner areas. 4. The Japanese puppets are doing their best to buy over the common people and exempt them from miscellaneous taxes, but they are extremely rewarding those who plant opium. All civil servants are allowed to smoke opium. 5. The Japanese puppets are doing their best to provoke the feelings of the Mongolian and Han nationalities. On the one hand, they are chanting slogans to allow the Mongolians to govern themselves. 6. The Japanese puppets are now recruiting Mongolians to work in various league agencies, giving them preferential treatment to buy over their hearts. The Mongolian and Tibetan personnel stationed in Beijing here today hosted a banquet for people from all walks of life, publicizing the above situation and hoping that the government would quickly prepare relief measures so as not to lag behind others.

<h3>The Sichuan War is Being Halted</h3>

Deng Xihou telegraphed Tian Songyao and Yang Sen, requesting that they follow the Central Government's telegram order, jointly dispatch troops to the war zone to monitor Liu Wenhui's withdrawal and return to defense, and implement forceful prevention, so that true peace can be achieved. Consequently, each army will draw a large portion of troops to jointly suppress the Red Bandits and further seek the unification of Sichuan's administration. 2. Yang Sen left Chongqing on the 23rd. Yang told people that suppressing the Red Bandits and pacifying Sichuan should be carried out simultaneously. First, eliminate obstacles to unification, and then internal strife can be permanently resolved, and the Red calamity will not be difficult to eliminate. 3.

<p>The Ministry of Justice Revises</p>
<h3>The Civil and Criminal Procedure Laws</h3>
<p>The Revision of Criminal Procedure Law is Completed</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter, recognizing the great significance of the Ministry of Justice's revision of the Civil and Criminal Procedure Laws, specifically visited Minister Luo Wengan to inquire about everything. According to Luo, the Ministry of Justice revised the Court Organization Law last year, which was submitted to the National Government and promulgated, changing the traditional four-level, three-instance system to a three-level system. This is a major reform in China's legal system. Moreover, the legislative principles of the 231st Central Political Conference in the 19th year of the Republic of China clearly stated that the scope of private prosecution should be expanded, and the legislative ideology should also undergo major changes. Therefore, the current Civil and Criminal Procedure Laws must be revised accordingly. The current laws' provisions regarding litigation procedures are not comprehensive and have many inconveniences in application, so they have been specially revised. The Criminal Procedure Law has now been revised and submitted to the Executive Yuan and will soon be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. As for Civil Procedure, because it is more complex, it will take until the end of the year to complete the revision. Before the revision is completed, to expedite the handling of cases by the courts, two items have been formulated: "Supplementary Measures for Civil Execution" and "Matters to be Noted in Handling Civil Litigation Cases," which will be promulgated and implemented by ministerial order.

The Ministry of Finance is currently striving to raise 70% of the total amount, 15.54 million yuan, and issue it on schedule. In the future, when financial resources are slightly more abundant, it may be possible to gradually increase the amounts, but at this time, the national treasury really cannot bear the burden.

<h3>The US-Soviet Diplomatic Relations are About to be Realized</h3>
<p>US Senators Take the Position of Promoting American Goods</p>
<p>Advocating the Early Restoration of Trade Relations with Russia</p>
<p>(Washington) After the news from London that the resumption of diplomatic relations between the US and Russia seems likely in the near future, US Senator Norris issued a statement today, urging the US to fully restore business relations with Russia as soon as possible. Norris stated that he is not against recognizing the Soviet Union, but he is also not making a specific recommendation for recognition, but rather wants to open up many institutions to the criticisms of the Soviet system and its abolition of religion. He does not agree with those who hold such anxieties, believing that today, we should break away from the traditional concepts left by religious beliefs and observe the reality of things. He also said that he has reliable information that the Soviet Union plans to purchase 50 million yuan worth of machinery, wheat, and cotton and is willing to purchase them from the US. Therefore, he advises the full restoration of business relations with Russia, taking the opportunity to promote American goods. He also said that he has studied the Soviet economic situation and seen its lack of cattle and sheep feed and will soon purchase it from abroad, and that the rapid progress of the Soviet Union in industrialization has eliminated the possibility of US-Soviet competition in agriculture to a significant extent. At the same time, the US Department of Commerce reported that the Soviet collective farm plan has not shown clear evidence of increased production compared to the old system. This report is for the President's reference in studying the recognition issue. It is said that its content has eliminated much of the terror that Americans held a year ago that the Soviet Union would disrupt the world market as an agricultural exporting country.

<h3>Disarmament Conference Scheduled to Convene</h3>

The Steering Committee is scheduled to meet in Geneva on June 27, and the General Assembly is scheduled to convene on July 3. Regarding the adjournment issue, a vote must be taken when the General Assembly convenes. (Reuters Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Bureau of the Disarmament Conference is scheduled to meet on Tuesday, and the General Committee is scheduled to convene on July 3. However, if the agenda cannot be determined, few delegation leaders are willing to come to Geneva. When the General Committee adjourned on June 2 this year, it entrusted the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, Henderson, to conduct negotiations on the following issues that are still in dispute: (1) Definition of aggressor; (2) Disarmament supervision; (3) Sanctions for violators of the disarmament convention; (4) Military organizations; (5) Naval disarmament; (6) Proportion of arms manufacturing; (7) Restriction of military budgets, etc. Henderson's trip to London was intended to take advantage of the gathering of representatives from various countries in London for the Economic Conference to conveniently consult with them. Unexpectedly, the authorities of various countries were busy with the Economic Conference and had no time for disarmament, so Henderson's mission could not begin. Most governments advocated postponing the Disarmament Conference to a more appropriate time, or perhaps until the beginning of October. However, the German government requested that the second reading of the British disarmament be held quickly and did not want to postpone the meeting. (Havas Telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3>Chiang Orders Five Provinces to Strictly Prohibit Sheltering Opium Smoking</h3>
<p>(Nanchang) Chairman Chiang telegraphed the chairmen of the five provinces of Henan, Hubei, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Jiangsu and the military commanders stationed there on the 24th, strictly ordering their subordinates not to harbor privately established opium dens. The telegram said: "All kinds of anti-opium regulations promulgated by the headquarters were originally intended to correct customs and seek practical results, so that addicts can gradually quit and those who are not addicted can be prevented from falling into addiction. All private purchases of opium and open opium dens are absolutely prohibited." (Omission) "Recently, it has been reported that in various rural towns and villages in the provinces, they are using the name of implementing anti-opium laws to openly establish opium dens, luring people to fall into depravity. This illegal behavior is extremely hateful. Therefore, I reiterate the laws and hope that you will strictly order your subordinates to comply with the regulations when handling anti-opium matters. If anyone violates the law, acts fraudulently, or takes advantage of the situation for personal gain, once discovered, in addition to the military law punishing the handlers, the authorities and supervisors of the province will be held accountable for failing to supervise strictly."

<h3>The Establishment of a Newsprint Factory</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry is also promoting the establishment of a newsprint factory, with a budget of 8 million yuan. Chen Gongbo went to Shanghai to contact the financial community and changed it to a joint public-private venture, with capital of 5 million yuan. Approximately 3 million yuan will be subscribed for, and the remaining 2 million yuan will be borne by the government. The location of the factory, whether it will be in Wenzhou, has not yet been determined. The main purpose is to specialize in the production of wood pulp for newsprint. Previously, Hangzhou Paper Industry Lai produced eight items of improvement on paper production and requested to establish a paper mill in the Xugan Xu Village Fan Village area of Hangzhou. China's annual demand for paper is estimated to be more than 20 million yuan, all of which are leaks. There are no domestic manufacturers of newsprint. The establishment of a newsprint factory is necessary to solve this major problem. (Special Dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>The Austro-German Conflict Has Become</p>
<h3>A Major Problem in Europe Today</h3>
<p>Hitler Intentionally Disrupts Austria</p>
<p>Fires Light Up More Than a Thousand Hilltops Across Austria</p>
<p>Mass Demonstrations Against Hitler</p>
<p>Havas Telegram from Vienna, 25th: According to reliable sources from Carinthia, hardliners from the Austrian Hitler Party have decided to take further action, aiming to ensure the victory of the National Socialist Party in Austria at any cost. The National Socialist Party Committee will be based on the German border, aiming to disrupt order and implement terrorism. The discovery of aircraft in Linz last Saturday was the beginning of the National Socialist Party's new actions.</p>
<p>Havas Telegram from Vienna, 25th: Austria's resistance to the activities of the Hitler Party has won the support of the majority of the people. Some here claim that the National Socialist Party issue can be resolved internally. If the Austrian National Socialist Party does not receive foreign aid, they will inevitably fail completely. Overall, this re-attack by the National Socialist Party was prepared entirely within Germany and openly assisted by the German National Socialist Party. Some even said that Hitler himself said that he would provide full assistance to the Austrian National Socialist Party movement. This statement was made by the Bavarian Minister of the Interior. Munich has now become the base of the National Socialist Party, specializing in directing actions against Austria. The aircraft in Linz last Saturday was the beginning of the National Socialist Party's re-attack. It is still difficult to determine where the National Socialist Party's comeback will be active. It will probably concentrate its forces in the German-Austrian border area. Recently, Dollfuss issued a declaration expressing his determination to defend Austria against the National Socialist Party's attack. However, the intention of this declaration is considered here to be not interpreted as Austria will resort to any form of foreign aid in the event of a violation of the treaty. Because Austria is, in any case, a German-speaking country, Austria does not want to easily take any action that is considered a betrayal of the interests of the German nation. However, observing the future situation, the views of Germany and Austria are becoming increasingly divergent and will inevitably be submitted to the international community. This is the inevitable result of the development of the situation and cannot be prevented by Austria. The "Federal Mail" stated that the policy adopted by the German government leader is to transform the Austrian National Socialist Party into a branch of the Berlin National Socialist Party. Therefore, the German government leader should be responsible for all actions of the Austrian National Socialist Party. It is also said that the danger currently faced by Germany is very great, and its severity has exceeded the scope of the two countries' dispute. Reuters Telegram from Vienna, 24th: The leader of the Austrian National Socialist Party, Blaschke, drove an airplane and dropped leaflets in Linz, removing the duties of Austrian National Socialist Party officials. This move is obviously intended to allow National Socialist Party members to have a way to excuse themselves when Austria experiences riots in the future. The leaflet also contained words from German Chancellor Hitler challenging the Austrian government and implying incitement to chaos. Austria specially lit fires on more than a thousand large and small hilltops across the country tonight in response. This is part of the patriotic demonstration pre-shown by Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss and the National Socialist Party's plan. Dollfuss said in a speech in Linz that the Austrian government will never be moved by threatening letters and that Austrians are prepared to defend their homeland to the last drop of blood. The leader of the Vienna National Socialist Party, Froehnfeld, was stopped in a village on his way to Italy and escorted back to Vienna, where he was arrested.</p>
<h3>Germany Trains White Russians</h3>
<p>(Havas Telegram from Berlin, 24th) The London "People's Voice" reported that 2,000 White Russians are currently receiving military training in Germany, and that the number will soon be expanded. The Konti News Agency denied this news.</p>
<h3>Hugenberg Resigns in Germany</h3>
<p>Reuters Telegram from Berlin, 24th: German Minister of Economy Hugenberg has already submitted his resignation, but President Hindenburg has not accepted it. Reuters Telegram from Berlin, 24th: Hugenberg wrote to President Hindenburg regarding his resignation, saying that the bill passed by the Reichstag on March 23, which allowed the National Socialist Party to have full power in the German government, will become invalid with his resignation. Because this power is limited to the fate of the current cabinet. However, the National Socialist Party said that the current cabinet is famous in the name of Hitler, so Hugenberg's withdrawal from the Hitler cabinet does not affect the position of the cabinet itself.</p>
<h3>Danzig is Hitlerized</h3>
<p>National Telegram from Danzig, 24th: The Danzig Parliament today passed a motion with 50 votes against 19, authorizing the government to promulgate and implement laws without having to submit them to Parliament for approval. It is said that this move is actually a sign of Hitlerizing the Free City of Danzig. All political changes in Danzig follow Germany's lead. Today's move was expected before the May 28 election. The city's security forces are all composed of members of the National Socialist Party, and the parliament is also controlled by the National Socialist Party. Some say that today's move is a prelude to declaring Danzig's re-integration with the law. However, the Danzig constitution is guaranteed by the League of Nations, so political leaders mostly believe that this may not happen for the time being.</p>
<h3>New Brewing in the European Situation</h3>
<p>Czech Foreign Minister is Active</p>
<p>The Italian Side Attaches Importance</p>
<p>Havas Telegram from Rome, 25th: The matter of Czech Foreign Minister Beneš meeting with the British and French governments in London and Paris has attracted great attention from the Italian side, although Italian newspapers have not commented on it. Moreover, because Beneš also met with the Italian representatives at the Economic Conference, it is even more important here. According to the conversations before and after the signing of the Four-Power Pact, Czechoslovakia's position on the Central European reconstruction issue has not completely conflicted with Italy's position on this issue. Before the Four-Power Pact was initialed, Beneš made several important speeches. What Italy paid the most attention to in these speeches was his compromising attitude. Although Italy cannot adopt Beneš's position, it hopes to find a solution that satisfies all parties. Italian newspapers pointed out Czechoslovakia's proposal to organize a Danube countries alliance, which Italy does not want to hear. Italy is deeply afraid of its neighbors forming a powerful alliance, so it prefers that Central European countries conclude bilateral treaties to contact each other. Regarding this, Italy's position seems to have not absolutely conflicted with Czechoslovakia's position. At this time, Italy's policies towards the three countries of the Little Entente are different. Italy takes an opposing attitude towards Yugoslavia, a compromising attitude towards Romania, and expects to obtain a better mutual understanding with Czechoslovakia.</p>
<p>National Telegram from Paris, 25th: Prime Minister Daladier met with Czech Foreign Minister Dr. Pinič today and had a long discussion on political issues.</p>
<h3>A Turning Point in British-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>Reuters Telegram from London, 24th: Today, Lord Privy Seal Baldwin said in a speech in Glasgow that if the Soviet Union releases the Vick Electric Company technicians, Sommer and Macdonald, who are imprisoned in Russia, and abandons its retaliatory actions against the British, then Britain can cancel its boycott of Russian goods. The old British-Soviet trade agreement was too biased, giving the Soviet Union most-favored-nation treatment in Britain, while Britain gained nothing. At the same time, trade between the two countries is mostly in the import of Russian goods, while exports are few. Therefore, the principle of equality between exports and imports will be used in the conclusion of new trade agreements in the future.</p>
<p>Roosevelt Implements Today</p>
<h3>A Plan to Raise Cotton Prices</h3>
<p>Advising Farmers to Destroy a Quarter of Cotton</p>
<p>National Telegram from Washington, 24th: President Roosevelt will attempt to raise cotton prices next Monday, starting by destroying a large portion of the ripening cotton crop. Starting next Monday, committees will go to the southern cotton-producing areas and distribute leaflets signed by the President to farmers, advising them to destroy a quarter of their harvest. The leaflet explains that although the matter belongs to destruction, the merit is actually equal to construction, and explains that cotton experts all believe that there is no other way to restore the proper position of the cotton industry. If it is not implemented accordingly, the South will continue to suffer from famine due to the tragic fall in cotton prices and will hinder general agriculture. According to the new emergency agriculture, farmers who destroy their harvests can receive government subsidies and have the right to purchase from sales cooperation agencies the right to deliver goods at any time when cotton prices rise. The government will allocate funds to organize agencies to receive this cotton harvest to compensate farmers who destroy their harvests. It is reported that the general farm families all agree with this strategy, considering it feasible, and many say that it should have been implemented earlier during the economic downturn, and it is expected that after the implementation of this strategy, there will be no oversupply of cotton, and the annual harvest can be equal to the needs of yarn mills. It is reported that President Hoover did not implement this strategy because he believed it set a dangerous precedent. President Roosevelt also hesitated at first, but has now decided. It is now heard that when propaganda begins tomorrow, farmers will be told that there is no concern about foreign cotton dumping into the US to reap the benefits of rising cotton prices, because the President can levy subsidized tariffs when necessary to subsidize farmers who have suffered sacrifices. As for how much to raise wheat prices in the future, neither the President nor the Department of Agriculture has made any firm promises, only that they will indicate during propaganda that after greatly reducing the cotton harvest, cotton prices will definitely rise. The income from this increase, together with the government subsidies, should be able to compensate the farmers' losses. As for wheat, it seems that the US government may not take such drastic measures, because the Department of Agriculture's investigation shows that extreme heat and rain have damaged a lot of the wheat harvest, and barley, oats, sugarcane, etc. have also suffered the same losses and will be harvests unseen for many years.</p>
<h3>A Bomb Exploded in the Roman Catholic Vatican</h3>
<p>National Telegram from Vatican City, 25th: A bomb suddenly exploded in the doorway of the Basilica of St. Peter in the Papal State this afternoon, injuring four people. The bomb was placed in a handbag. Two people placed it in a small room where guests can store handbags, canes, umbrellas, cameras, etc., when entering the Vatican with the crowd. Then, there was a loud bang, and the people nearby were extremely frightened. Fortunately, the damage was not huge, and the injuries of the four people were not serious. Afterwards, the Vatican immediately closed its doors, and the Vatican police, assisted by the Italian authorities, searched the entire city. After more than an hour, they found nothing, and the doors were reopened.</p>
<h3>Intensifying Anti-Japanese Sentiment in Zhangjiakou</h3>
<p>Dada</p>
<p>Feng Declares Recapture of Dolon, Temporarily Will Not Abolish Anti-Japanese Army</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan Postpones Return to Chahar, He and Huang Telegraph Central Government for Instructions</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Since various parties have been working actively on the Chahar issue, progress towards a peaceful resolution has gradually emerged. The Central Government has been handling the Chahar matter step by step, and orders for Song Zheyuan to return and preside over Chahar’s administration and for Pang Bingxun to serve as the Commander-in-Chief of bandit suppression in Chahar have been issued successively. However, due to the complex relationships among various parties and the potential for unforeseen circumstances, the atmosphere in Zhangjiakou has suddenly changed, and the prospect of peace has encountered new complications. Zhang Jiyong and Lei Jishang, who went to Zhangjiakou to meet with Feng, returned to Beiping yesterday morning. Zhang and others arrived in Zhangjiakou on the 21st and met with Feng that night in Xincun, reporting on the progress of negotiations in Beiping and the steps for resolving the Chahar issue. Feng neither approved nor disapproved. The next morning, he convened a meeting with Fang Zhenwu and others, with Zhang Jiyong and others also in attendance. During the meeting, there were diverse opinions regarding abolishing the name of the Anti-Japanese Army and the local issues of Chahar Province. At night, Feng separately invited Zhang Jiyong and others to discuss the matter individually. Subsequently, he telegraphed Song, welcoming him to lead his troops back to Chahar immediately. He also drafted a personal letter to be brought back to Beiping by Zhang and others to report back to the Central Government. The letter expressed four points: 1. Hoping that Song would lead his troops back to Chahar as soon as possible, personal advancement or retreat is not a problem. 2. Since raising the banner of anti-Japanese resistance this time, he is determined to focus on external rather than internal conflicts. To implement anti-Japanese action, he has mobilized his troops to Zhang-Duo Avenue, preparing to recapture lost territory and aiming to recover Dolon in the shortest possible time. 3. Sun Dianying has contributed to the anti-Japanese cause, Fang Zhenwu has sacrificed his family to serve the country, and Deng Wen, Li Zhongyi, and other armies have fought for thousands of miles. He hopes that methods will be found to properly handle them. 4. He has not considered his personal reputation and appreciates the friendly concern of others who intend to grant him the position of National Forest Reclamation Director. He expresses deep gratitude, but his personal actions must be cautious. He started for the sake of anti-Japanese resistance, and it would be inappropriate for him to abandon the anti-Japanese banner and seek high office and honors. From this perspective, Feng’s opinions have already changed from what he expressed earlier and are in contradiction with the solution sought by various parties in recent days. Therefore, this trip by Zhang and others can be said to have yielded no results. However, after Zhang and others returned to Beiping and got out of the train, they immediately went to Song Zheyuan’s residence to report the progress. Song then convened a meeting of Qin Decun, Ge Dingyuan, Feng Zhi’an, Liu Ruming, and other senior personnel that afternoon to discuss the matter in detail. After the meeting, Qin Decun and others presented Feng’s original letter without comment to He Yingqin at Jurentang. He invited Song, Pang, Shang Zhen, Xu Yongchang, and others to discuss the matter at around 7 PM last night (the 23rd), deciding to telegraph the Central Government and Chairman Chiang for instructions while still seeking solutions based on the initial intention of peace. As of this morning (the 24th), the Central Government’s response had not yet arrived in Beiping. The authorities here will consult with all relevant parties after the response arrives. Song Zheyuan had originally planned to go to the front lines today to prepare to lead his troops back to Chahar, but due to slight changes in the situation, the discussion of returning to Chahar has been temporarily postponed.</p>
<p>The sudden changes in the Chahar situation are due to complex reasons. 1. Feng’s raising of the anti-Japanese banner in Chahar this time was preceded by contacts and negotiations with various parties. Monthly expenses were estimated at 1.1 to 1.2 million, and 980,000 had already been distributed by various parties in the first month. Various parties will continue to assist in the future. The situation was tense a few days ago, and various parties intervened, slightly easing the situation. However, the true intentions of Zhangjiakou differ slightly from what has been reported externally. Recently, representatives from the southwest have been stationed in Tianjin, plotting and communicating with Zhangjiakou. The change in the atmosphere in Zhangjiakou has been influenced by the complex relationships of various parties. 2. Fang Zhenwu does not want to leave the army and requires at least the title of Commander-in-Chief of bandit suppression in Chahar to command his troops. However, the Central Government only agreed to grant him titles such as Forest Reclamation Conference and Provincial Committee. More recently, Pang Bingxun was appointed Commander-in-Chief of bandit suppression in Chahar, extinguishing his hopes. As a result, Fang has become quite extreme and sent a telegram on the 21st with extremely激昂claims. This is also related to the changes in the Chahar situation. 3. Sun Dianying’s position as Director of Qinghai Reclamation was opposed by Ningxia Chairman Ma Hongkui and Qinghai Chairman Ma Lin. The Mas telegraphed the Central Government to express their views. At the same time, Qinghai natives in Beijing also appealed to the National Government. Although Chiang approved Sun’s new position, the Central Government is unlikely to pass it in reality. Sun’s inability to settle down is also related to the Chahar situation. 4. Feng has expanded and reorganized a large number of troops in Chahar, and it is extremely difficult to handle them. This is also sufficient to affect the peaceful resolution of the Chahar situation. Due to these factors, the Chahar situation has fallen into a state of entanglement again. It is difficult to predict the future. Feng and others are still singing the praises of anti-Japanese resistance in their actions. Liu Guitang has repeatedly sent representatives to meet with Feng to discuss surrender, and Feng has agreed. Liu expressed his sincere support to Feng and is willing to cede the defense of the Guyuan area to Feng to facilitate the capture of Dolon. Feng has now appointed Fang Zhenwu as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northern Route Anti-Japanese Army and Ji Hongchang as the Commander-in-Chief of the Forward. The day before yesterday (the 22nd), Ji visited Zhangbei to inspect the defenses. Deng Wen and other volunteer armies have also been ordered by Feng to station on the Zhang-Duo line, preparing to move out. Feng and others claim to recover Dolon in the shortest possible time and will at least recover a part of the lost territory. Zhangjiakou convened a mass meeting of citizens the day before yesterday, with slogans. It will be difficult for Feng to abolish the title of Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army for a while. (June 24)</p>
<h3>Puppet Government Established by Puppet Troops in Eastern Luan</h3>
<p>Da</p>
<p>Japanese Protection Prevents Resolution</p>
<p>Yongjin’s Negotiations in Changchun Stalled</p>
<p>Puppet Troops Active in Ninghe and Lutai</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Since the signing of the truce agreement, the withdrawal of Japanese troops has been extremely slow. The puppet troops in the war zone, protected by the Japanese army, are increasingly rampant. These puppet troops numbered only a few during the war, waving flags and shouting slogans, acting as accomplices. Recently, negotiations on reorganization have yielded no results. They are recruiting refugees and vigorously expanding their ranks. With the manipulation of disillusioned military personnel and politicians, and the formation of complex relationships, their momentum is growing. Recently, Hao Peng, Li Jiasan, Du Yi, and Bai Jianwu, the masterminds of the Tianjin Incident, have gone there and actually established the puppet organization of the “North China People’s Autonomous Allied Army Military Government” a few days ago (the 21st). They have set up the highest military and political organs in Tangshan and Qinhuangdao and issued preposterous and absurd telegrams. Upon investigation, the members of these puppet troops are complex and have divergent opinions. There are roughly two factions: one is the Tangshan faction, including Li Jichun, Zhao Lei, Cheng Guorui, and the newly joined Hao Peng, Li Jiasan, and Du Yi, who call themselves the Autonomous Army; the other is the Qinhuangdao faction, led by Ma Tingfu, Shi Yousan, Bai Jianwu, and Yang Dianyun, who call themselves the An Guo Army. The number of puppet troops was initially only two to three thousand, but after expansion, it has reached more than ten thousand. The salaries are taken from local areas, and the weapons are still secretly supplied by the Japanese. The Japanese have repeatedly claimed that they will no longer supply the puppet troops, which is a lie. The area occupied by the puppet troops has reached eleven or twelve counties, covering more than seven thousand square miles east and west of the Luan River, arbitrarily trampling on the people, leaving them in dire straits. Although the puppet troops are so rampant, they are a ragtag bunch. Without the protection of the Japanese army, suppression or pacification would not be a problem. However, the Japanese army on the south bank of the Luan River has not yet shown any signs of withdrawal. At the same time, the Japanese troops on the Tongdong and Pingbei roads, which are in the process of withdrawing, are also at a standstill. Without the withdrawal of the Japanese troops, resolving the issue of the puppet troops cannot be started. Therefore, in fact, it cannot be accomplished without the assistance of the Japanese. The Japanese have been secretly protecting the puppet troops all along for various reasons: on the one hand, they waved flags and shouted slogans for them during the war; on the other hand, they can still be used in the future. Currently, they are purely using delaying tactics on this matter. After Jixuezhong and others came to Beiping to discuss the solution, Huang negotiated with the Japanese representative Yongjin. Yongjin agreed to telegraph the commander of the Kwantung Army, Muto, for instructions. After several days, the Japanese have not responded. The day before yesterday, Yongjin went to Changchun from Beiping, and this negotiation has fallen into a state of stagnation. Whether it can be resolved smoothly in the future depends on the intentions of the Japanese and our diplomatic skills. In recent days, the puppet troops in the Ninghe area have been rotated. Zhao Lei’s puppet troops have been transferred to Xugezhuang and the railway line in the Ninghe area, and Cheng Guorui’s reverse troops have taken over the defense. More than 100 of Cheng’s troops have entered Ninghe City. The situation near Lutai is tense. The puppet troops actually notified the residents of Lutai yesterday to move out as soon as possible, for unknown reasons. More than 20 Japanese troops are stationed at Jiangwakou in northern Ninghe and have not shown any signs of withdrawal. New recruits recruited by the puppet troops in various counties in eastern Luan are being sent to the Yuguan area to form the Jing’an Guerrilla. The transportation is currently underway. The Japanese and puppets will hold a grand meeting for the war dead on the Great Wall line in Yuguan tomorrow. The chief of staff of the Japanese Kwantung Army Headquarters, Koiso, will go to Yuguan as a representative to pay tribute, and it is planned to convene a meeting of puppet rebels. After the director of the Niulanshan Public Security Bureau in Pingbei was driven away by Japanese soldiers, the Japanese army has completed the dispatch of Zhao Yudong from Huairou County, which is being occupied, to Niulanshan to take over the position. The Shunyi County Government is currently seeking instructions from the Provincial Government. The recent actions of the Japanese army are clearly contrary to the truce agreement. It is hoped that the authorities will earnestly negotiate with the Japanese. (June 24)</p>
<h3>Li Yongxiang Was Kidnapped by Japanese Police in Beiping</h3>
<p>Jin</p>
<p>Li Was the Commander-in-Chief of the Sino-Korean Allied Army</p>
<p>Recently Came to Beiping to Promote the Anti-Japanese Movement</p>
<p>Contacted the Korean Independence Party in Shanghai</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: At about 8:00 AM on the 23rd, a car with the license plate number 630 stopped in front of the Shoushan Apartment in the Canzheng Hutong in Xuannei. Six people got out of the car, four in Western clothes and two in Chinese clothes. After getting out of the car, they entered the front desk. The one in Chinese clothes, claiming to be surnamed Li, said he was looking for Mr. Li Yongxiang at number 25. The clerk replied that Mr. Li had not yet gotten up and that he would go and see. Li said there was no need to see and went in together. When they arrived at number 35, Li had indeed not gotten up. The clerk called him and said someone was looking for him. Li got up and invited them in. Because he did not recognize them, he could only say, “Please sit down, please sit down.” The clerk thought they were close friends and immediately left. In less than ten minutes, Li followed the six people out and got into the car. When the six people entered the house, the lawyer Gu Zhenhe, who lived in the next room, was in his room. He said that after the six people entered the house, they all spoke Japanese and there was a sound of turning over boxes and intimidating. At noon, the person who was looking for Li came again with one person in a car. After getting out of the car, they went to the accounting room and said they had a letter signed by Li Yongxiang to collect his luggage and settle the account. After speaking, they produced Li’s letter, which read, “To the Shoushan Apartment accounting room: Please trouble this person to bring my luggage. I will send it all here immediately. Do not discuss any other matters. Sincerely, Li Yongxiang,” followed by an English signature. When the accounting room staff saw the letter, they settled the account and handed over the luggage. While they were taking the luggage, several apartment staff were standing in front of the door. The driver said, “What crime did your guest commit?” The staff said, “How would we know?” The driver said, “Do you know who we are?” The staff replied that they did not know either. The driver finally said, “We are from the Japanese Police Department.” At this time, the luggage was moved and they drove away again. At 4:00 PM, the person surnamed Li came again and said he wanted to take a look at room 35 and broke in directly. He saw two staff cleaning the room and picked up two envelopes from the pile of waste paper and left. It is learned that Li Yongxiang is the Commander-in-Chief of the Sino-Korean Allied Army. He came north in March to engage in work. He was betrayed and kidnapped. Li Lingran, who lived in the same room, had a lawsuit with Sun Guanying and had gone elsewhere and was not arrested.</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 24th, detectives from the Beiping Gendarmerie Headquarters received the news and went to Shoushan Apartment to inquire about Li Yongxiang’s whereabouts. The accounting room, Xie Ying, replied that after Mr. Li left, someone settled the account he owed. According to the apartment rules, all travelers can move out after settling their accounts. The person who moved the luggage gave the staff a tip of one yuan and one dime. Mr. Li moved in on May 25th of this year and lived in the apartment quietly. At 3:00 PM that afternoon, two female students came to Shoushan Apartment to visit Li. The accounting room said that Li had been kidnapped by the Japanese, and the two female students left in disappointment. According to Ms. Tang Qin, a resident of Shoushan Apartment, the kidnapping of Li Yongxiang occurred as follows: Mr. Li originally lived in room 14, which cost nine yuan. Due to financial difficulties, he moved into room 35, which cost six yuan. He was usually taciturn and quite honest. Suddenly, at about 8:00 AM yesterday, two Japanese and Chinese vagrants came and said they were looking for Mr. Li Yongxiang. After entering the room, Li said, “Please sit down.” Not long after, the Japanese searched many letters of appointment in Mr. Li’s box. The two sides argued in Japanese. Finally, they took him into the car and went to a certain place in Dongjiaominxiang. Mr. Li is Korean. He came to Beiping on May 25th of this year. On the apartment registration book, he wrote Li Yongxiang, from Kunming, Yunnan, 39 years old. Four years ago, he made a living selling medicine in Shanghai. The year before last, he sold medicine in Liaoning. After the Northeast Incident occurred, Mr. Li was unwilling to operate under the rule of the puppet state, so he came to Beiping and opened a pharmacy. The business was flourishing.</p>
<p>According to foreign sources, Li Yongxiang is an important figure in the Korean Independence Party. He advocates that Korea should break away from Japan and become an independent country. He has written many works and promoted the independence movement in Shanghai and Liaoning. After the Northeast Incident, Li came to Beiping to engage in the anti-Japanese movement. Later, after the Japanese detectives learned about it, he remained silent and moved from Dongcheng Yanle Hutong to Shoushan Apartment in Dingxi City, pretending to be in the academic circle and claiming to make a living selling medicine. He was a fake doctor because he wanted to treat Korea. After Li took office as Commander-in-Chief of the Sino-Korean Allied Army, he contacted the Shanghai Independence Party.

<h3>Discovery of Anti-Tax Army</h3>
<p>Spreads Across Qionglai, Dayi, Pengpu, Danling, and Jiajiang Areas</p>
<p>Organization Deeply Penetrates the People, Momentum Extremely Strong</p>
<p>Possesses the Potential to Become an Uncontrollable Wildfire</p>
<p>Dispatch from Chengdu: Since the outbreak of the war in western Sichuan, it has had a huge direct and indirect impact on the entire province. In the corner of northern Sichuan, the Red Bandits have made a comeback and re-occupied Ba Nan. In western and southern Sichuan, bandit groups have risen and order is in great disorder, making it impossible to clean up. The military authorities only know how to exploit the people’s wealth to fund the war effort, so the people often resort to desperate measures, and cunning people take advantage of this, which is how the Anti-Tax Army in southern Sichuan arose. When the Sichuan war occurred last year, there were signs of an anti-tax movement in southern Sichuan, but before it could be officially launched, the war had already stopped, so the military was able to nip the problem in the bud. Most of the counties in southern Sichuan are areas with barren land and poor people. The 24th Army used to have a relatively wide defense area. At the financial meeting of the army in the 17th year, it was decided to collect grain twice a year, which was slightly lighter than the defense areas of other armies. However, in recent years, due to the expansion of the army’s strength and huge expenses, the number of pre-collection times has been repeatedly increased to three or four times. There are also so-called national defense donations and other names. As a result of the war last year, the army’s defense area suddenly shrank, and it became even more difficult to provide meals. Therefore, there is a new rule of eight collections a year, divided into four quarters, with each quarter calculated in three months, and grain is collected twice on average each quarter. This year, the third and fourth collections have already begun, and the people of various counties have long been suffering from the supply. The officials who urge the collection are eager and do not make any loans. During this military period, the collection of funds in various counties is becoming more urgent. Regardless of whether the people are unable to bear it, even the local militia personnel cannot collect it. They want to resign but cannot. In addition, the people of the barren land are fierce and unrestrained. Nying and Ya are known as bandit dens. Deserters and scattered bandits are lurking everywhere, and the influence of the Gelaohui is particularly deep in the people. The helmsmen with high prestige can summon a large number of followers with guns and weapons in an instant. Initially, only a small number of people were engaged in the anti-tax movement. After revealing the purpose and slightly promoting it, sympathizers followed one after another, like ants clinging to something smelly, gathering more and more people. In addition, during the war, most of the local garrison troops were transferred, and the troops left behind were not enough to suppress them. As for the militia in various counties, most of them secretly communicated with the Anti-Tax Army. On this day, this emerging force has become increasingly powerful due to the opportunity. In the beginning, only most of the towns and villages in Qionglai County were occupied by them. After Chen Jun, the magistrate of Qionglai County, led the military group to suppress them, the Anti-Tax Army adopted guerrilla tactics, attacking here and fleeing there. Chen was appointed by the 24th Army to be the commander of bandit suppression, and then he was appointed as the rear garrison commander of the 24th Army. He also ordered the teams from the four counties of Qionglai, Pujiang, Dayi, and Mingshan to be transferred to the command. After Chen was appointed, although he successively recovered the towns and villages in Qionglai, similar organizations were found in the neighboring counties at the same time. The situation in Ya’an is particularly rampant. The Wushenkou, which belongs to the county, was burned down, and one group flowed across the Zike Street and occupied Zhongshanping, preparing to invade Daba. Those in Qionglai were initially entrenched in Jiajie, which is located in the middle of four mountains and has always been a gathering place for outlaws. Since last winter, more than 3,000 people have gathered there. The burning of Wushenkou in Ya’an was also done by this group. Secondly, the borders of Danling, Pujiang, Mingshan, and Dayi counties also frequently reported alarms. The 24th Army has transferred a part of the Gaoyu Cong Brigade stationed in Qionglai and the Qing Han Nanbu of the Tuntian Army to cooperate with the militias of various counties to carry out a large-scale suppression. However, the Anti-Tax Army has a large number of people, sometimes dividing into small groups to meet the government army, and sometimes dividing into small groups to flee into the deep mountains. Such as the Tiantai Mountain Maxianling area, are their bases. Recently, the Anti-Tax Army in Dayi County is particularly rampant. It is heard that its internal organization is quite similar to the Red Bandits, and slogans are posted everywhere it passes. It is also heard that Yang Ren’an (formerly the brigade commander of Liu Wenhui) has joined, and it is gradually spreading to Ningyuan and the seven counties. The 24th Army did not dare to underestimate this kind of organization, fearing that once its strength grew, it would be enough to subvert the army, so it decided to draw four brigades of troops from western Sichuan to suppress it. The two brigades of Gaoyu Cong and Yu Lanhai have already set off. Other troops such as Xu Guangfu and Shi Zhaowu are also preparing to set off. As for Qingshen, Pengshan, Hongya, Jiajiang and other counties connected to Qionglai, they are now responding one after another. It is recently rumored that the magistrate of Jiajiang County has been harmed by bandits. After checking its content, it is actually the Communist Party secretly instigating it, and the general small landlords also cannot live due to the excessive taxes, and are persuaded by the Communist Party, so they take the risk. Therefore, most of the Anti-Tax Army in various counties are militias, and there is no so-called doctrine. This incident was purely driven by interests. Its highest authority is the Anti-Tax Datong League jointly formed by the seven counties, divided into four general commanders. Initially, there were more than 5,000 people, but now it is expanding its strength and colluding with bandits on a large scale, so its momentum has become more fierce in recent days and has the potential to become a prairie fire. Therefore, it also affects the war between the 24th and 28th armies. Originally, the 24th Army planned to attack the 28th Army again while the 29th Army sent rear troops to reinforce it after the two counties of Tongnan were recaptured by bandits. However, this change occurred in the rear, and it had to transfer the Yu and two brigades back from the front line to quell the bandits. The original plan was temporarily suspended. Therefore, the front line has been quiet in the past few days, which is the reason. (June 18)</p>

<h3>Second Security Regiment Departs for Province</h3>
<p>Since Commander Cao of the Second Security Regiment stationed in Songjiang led the troops to Suining and other places in northern Jiangsu to suppress bandits last year, only Vice Commander Fan Xijun concurrently served as the company commander of the military academy company, guarding the regiment headquarters in Songjiang. Now the military academy company has completed its training in early June. Commander Cao personally attended the graduation ceremony. Now, according to the provincial order, the Second Regiment is transferred to Zhenjiang, and the Third Regiment is transferred to Songjiang to take over the defense. The two battalions of the Third Regiment, led by Battalion Commander Jiang, came to Songjiang and stationed in the Fucheng Chenghuang Temple. The military academy company of the Second Regiment, led by Vice Commander Fan, departed by car today (the 25th). It is said that the regiment headquarters of the Second Regiment is stationed in Jinshan Temple in Zhenjiang.</p>
<h3>Reward Offered for Arrest of Culprit in the Xi Family Tragedy</h3>
<p>After the tragic murder of Xi Yongda, chairman of the Weiquan Rice Shop in Huayang Bridge, and his wife and servant, the son of the deceased invited relatives and friends to inspect the house. More than 2,000 yuan, which Weiquan had prepared to buy fields, and scattered sums of money in various places were still in their original places. The deed contracts and account books were also not lost, which aroused suspicion among the people in society that the case seemed to be a revenge killing. Now, the water and land public security agencies are using various means to investigate. The Xi family relatives jointly decided to offer a reward of 1,000 yuan for the arrest of the culprit. I don’t know when they will be able to catch him.</p>

<h3>Female Student Commits Suicide Due to Love Affair</h3>
<p>The private Jingzhi Girls’ School in Beichan Temple Alley in the city was founded by Hou Baosan, a local resident, and has been the oldest girls’ school in the city for more than 20 years. Xu Dongping, the director of school affairs and accountant, is 37 years old and Hou Baosan’s nephew. He is fond of women and appreciates his own romanticism. Three years ago, he suddenly had an affair with Zhu Zhenru, a first-year student in the school’s senior high, who is 19 years old now and is a beauty in the school and the captain of the school’s volleyball team. Since the relationship with Xu, the feelings between the two sides have been deep. However, recently Xu Dongping suddenly had an affair with another female student, Jiang Yansen from Kunshan, causing a sea of ​​jealousy. The school’s classmates have also detected their secret and ridiculed Jiang. Jiang was not only betrayed by Xu, but also not understood by her classmates, and became increasingly regretful. At 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, she left the school alone and drowned herself in the East Pond. Fortunately, she was rescued by passers-by and was revived. Since the occurrence of this case, all the teachers and staff of the school have expressed dissatisfaction. The matter concerns the reputation of all teachers and students of the school, and they immediately unanimously submitted their resignations to the principal. At that time, Zhu and Jiang also left the school yesterday and returned to their homes separately. I don’t know what the outcome of this triangle love affair between teachers and students will be.</p>
<h3>Madman Kills Wife and Commits Suicide Out of Fear of Crime</h3>
<p>Ren Qinghe, a resident of No. 4 Dong Street, Hengjie Township, Beixizhang, District 5, used to be the boss in the Zhenjiang class of the Taichang Shipping Company and was trusted by the company. In January of this year, Qinghe suddenly went mad and spoke incoherently. His wife, Sun, lived with him in Zhenjiang. Although he was treated by a doctor, he did not get better. In February, he suddenly jumped into the river from the ship to commit suicide. After being rescued by his colleagues, he held a knife to commit suicide, and his colleagues rescued him again. The suicide failed. At this point, the bureau gave him a bonus and asked Ren’s wife to accompany her husband back to Xixi for treatment. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning (the 24th), Qinghe suddenly took a kitchen knife and slashed Sun’s left throat, which was about three inches long. Sun ran out in pain and called for help, and then died. At this time, Qinghe also took a knife to commit suicide out of fear of crime, slashing himself five times in the neck and also died from serious injuries.</p>

He was taken to the bureau by the chief police officer. After preliminary interrogation by the branch director Xu Ke, he confessed that he had committed many major cases and had repeatedly committed crimes in Wuxi. The Wuxi Investigation Team is also hunting him down. He has many accomplices, and several have been arrested and imprisoned by the county government. The branch bureau believed that the suspect was indeed a notorious bandit, so it dispatched many police officers on the morning of the 25th to escort him to the County Public Security Bureau and transfer him to the county for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Apprentice in Loom Workshop Electrocuted to Death</h3>
<p>Huang Shangsheng, an apprentice in the Yao Zhongyue loom workshop at No. 2 Guancai Lane, Zhaobaotang, Dongjie Road, Hangzhou, is from Shaoxing and is 25 years old. He has been in the workshop for only three months. At 9:30 last night, the apprentice wanted to read a newspaper on the edge of the bed after finishing work. He pulled the electric light hanging on the machine to the edge of the bed. Unexpectedly, because it was hot, Huang Gaosheng was not wearing any clothes, so the flower touched the meat and was sucked by the electricity. He fell to the ground and was sent to the hospital for treatment by his roommate. Two injections of cardiotonics were given, but both were ineffective, and he died.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Address</h3>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai delivered the opening remarks, stating that the chamber has been established for four years and, in accordance with regulations, holds a general meeting of member representatives once a year. This meeting marks the fourth time, and he is deeply pleased to meet with everyone. He explained that the purpose of convening the general meeting of member representatives is twofold: firstly, to determine the direction of chamber affairs for the year; and secondly, to assess whether elected officials have fulfilled their duties diligently. Commercial organizations in our country have a long history, and even with the adoption of modern European and American organizational structures and new regulations, they have existed for over thirty years. However, whether their efficiency matches that of chambers of commerce in other developed European and American countries is a matter of common knowledge and need not be elaborated upon. The nation faces grave difficulties, especially now. Enemies who slander us often criticize our nation for lacking unity and organization. Where can the strength of unity and organization be demonstrated? The sound and progressive development of group endeavors serves as an accurate measure. Therefore, Wang Xiaolai and others believe that to save the nation from disaster and prevent powerful enemies from coveting it, we must first focus on uniting occupational groups at our service, and earnestly work to achieve this, which is what modern people call patriotic actions at one's post. Wang Xiaolai and his colleagues are committed to this principle, adhering to their oaths, and dedicating themselves to their work, hoping not to betray the public's trust and to contribute to alleviating the current difficulties, even in the smallest way. Over the past year, we have handled various matters, and only a dozen or so have been resolved satisfactorily. The pain of the business community has largely not been alleviated, and the promotion of domestic goods has yielded minimal results. While this is partly due to environmental constraints, it is also due to our limited ability and resources, which have prevented us from meeting the expectations of merchants. Therefore, on the occasion of today's meeting, I would like to express my feelings of remorse to all representatives and ask for your assessment and support.</p>
<h3>Representatives' Remarks</h3>
<p>Tao Baichuan from the Municipal Party Headquarters stated, "Today, I am attending the fourth general meeting of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. As a representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, I have participated in the first, second, and third meetings of the chamber, and today marks the fourth time. I am honored to participate in this grand event with leaders from various industries. I heard Chairman Wang mention a new slogan, 'Patriotism at One's Post,' which I strongly agree with and would like to discuss with everyone. The so-called 'Patriotism at One's Post' is something that not only merchants but every citizen in the country should strive for, as a way to save the nation through self-help. Only by diligently fulfilling one's duties in their respective positions and achieving satisfactory results can one fulfill their patriotic responsibility. When it comes to merchants' positions, there should be two: one is their own position as merchants, and the other is their position as citizens. If merchants only know their position as merchants and are unaware of their position as citizens, they would be like Jewish merchants, who only recognize their own position and have no national or ethnic consciousness, as if they have no country. However, they ultimately lost the protection that a country should provide to its citizens because of this. We know that citizens of every country have the ability to participate in political and social organizations. Regarding participation in social organizations, whether in agriculture, industry, commerce, or academia, each sector has its basic position and can fulfill its share of responsibility in saving the nation. Currently, the most important task in the position of citizens is the issue of ending civil wars. If civil wars cannot be stopped, it can be said that domestic industry and commerce will never develop, the Japanese imperialists' ambitions will intensify, and the social economy will move further towards bankruptcy, making it impossible to remedy. I remember that at a memorial meeting for the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen, I gave a speech in which someone asked me why there are more rebellions in our country than in any other country. I told him that the first reason is the decline of our country's inherent ethnic morality, with new morality not yet in place and old morality being discarded. The second reason is the issue of civil rights, with citizens lacking political knowledge, ability, and interest. The third reason is the people's livelihood issue, with the development of domestic production and the collapse and bankruptcy of the economy interacting to form this negative trend. Now that we are merchants, the only effective way we can save the nation within our capacity is to develop production. Therefore, from a passive perspective, we advocate for ending civil wars, and from an active perspective, we strive for lasting peace. From the above conclusion, we can derive that the first is the position of citizens, to fulfill our civic responsibility in politics and work to end civil wars; and the second is the position of merchants, to do our best to promote domestic goods and develop production economically. This is my contribution to the 'Patriotism at One's Post' concept mentioned by Chairman Wang earlier." (2) Wu Huanru from the Social Affairs Bureau stated, "Today, I am very honored to attend the fourth general meeting of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce as a representative of the Social Affairs Bureau. I would like to offer a few points for your consideration. Shanghai is the most prosperous area in China and the economic center of the country. All undertakings serve as models for various places, especially the actions of merchants, which can represent the entire country. Since the January 28 Incident last year, the people of Shanghai have suffered deeply and greatly. Afterwards, the affected areas were gradually restored by the government, with the help of merchants. The government should express its gratitude for this. In the current era, when the economies of all countries in the world are in recession, we feel our own danger even more. In the past, China, which has always prided itself on its vast land and abundant resources, could still export its native products and import manufactured goods from abroad, barely maintaining its existence. However, due to the development of science in foreign countries and the backwardness of domestic production, we are heavily influenced by the massive import of foreign surplus goods. Examining the annual customs import reports, imports exceed exports, with the gap increasing year by year, while exports decrease year by year. A country's strength can be seen from its trade balance. As our country has suffered from this trend, the rural economy has gone bankrupt. Often, a farmer works diligently all day long but still cannot get enough to eat. The low prices of agricultural products are also a major cause of unrest. Therefore, if we want to become an exporting country, we must: (1) increase production; (2) maintain commodity prices; and (3) block loopholes. These three points depend on the government's leadership and the use of tariff policies for protection. However, due to diplomatic or treaty relations, the government is still unable to help. Therefore, we should still fulfill our responsibilities as citizens, work hard to increase production, and resist foreign goods to help the country resist foreign aggression. I hope the business community will act in good conscience, work hard on these points, eliminate all differences among colleagues, and unite with each other, stand on the same front, and develop outwards, so that the national economy can be restored to prosperity, and the future of the nation is deeply dependent on it," and so on.</p>
<h3>Report on Chamber Affairs</h3>
<p>Next, Wang Yansong reported on chamber affairs, stating, "In the past year, the chamber, in view of the increasing foreign aggression and shrinking territory since the January 28 Incident, and the national economy falling into a state of recession, proposed two major tasks: abolishing civil wars and promoting domestic goods, as the common goals of our merchant community, in order to remedy the situation. Although progress has been made, significant results have not been achieved, but we remain committed to these goals and will continue to work tirelessly. This is what all the members of the chamber dare to pledge, and it is the shared belief of all merchants. As for the daily chamber affairs, there are many categories, and it is not difficult to review them. Here, I will highlight the ones that have been handled with considerable success: (1) At last year's general meeting of member representatives, the sauce and wine, paint, and silk thread industries, among others, proposed that all companies, factories, and stores in the same industry should join the industry association, so that the organizational foundation could be strengthened. The chamber, based on the situation and in accordance with the law, submitted a request to the government, departments, and ministries, and sent representatives to the capital to petition for the amendment of the Industry Association Law. As a result, in October of last year, the Social Affairs Bureau issued an order, which was forwarded by the National Government, approving the amendment of Article 7 of the Industry Association Law, changing the word 'may' to 'should,' so that all companies, firms, and stores in the same industry 'should' be members of the industry association. (2) Civil boats from Suzhou, Jiaxing, and other places, traveling to and from Shanghai, carrying local goods, no longer needed to report to customs and pay taxes after the abolition of the regular customs. However, the Shanghai Customs detained and fined civil boats from these places for transporting goods. The chambers of commerce in Suzhou, Jiaxing, and other places, as well as various industry associations in this city, requested assistance. Based on the Regulations on Chinese Ships Traveling Between Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Shanghai Carrying Passengers and Goods, we repeatedly telegraphed requests for rectification. In December of last year, the Jianghai Customs issued a notice approving the abolition of the regulations, and civil boats carrying local goods are exempt from transit taxes when passing through customs. (3) The coal and stone barge industry and other associations complained that the Navigation Administration Bureau was charging repeated registration fees for inland river vessels and requested relief. According to the Maritime Law, the Navigation Administration Bureau's management of ships has limited restrictions. We submitted separate reports to the Executive Yuan and the Municipal Government, requesting prompt relief. Later, it was reported that the Ministry of Communications, noting that the Navigation Administration Bureau's registration offices were established throughout the interior, and that the central and local authorities' powers were indeed confusing and causing pain to the people, ordered that the scope of jurisdiction and organizational structure be reduced, and that all ships not subject to the Maritime Law should not be under the Bureau's jurisdiction, and all registration offices should be abolished. (4) The Municipal Health Bureau's implementation of inspection fees for meat entering the city was repeatedly requested to be abolished by the preserved meat and ham industries. We repeatedly submitted reports and sent Wang, Standing Committee Member Yansong, along with representatives from the industry, to Beijing to petition. As a result, it was approved to reduce the fee from five jiao per hundred to one jiao. We are still submitting requests to the Executive Yuan and the ministries to completely abolish the fee, or otherwise, we request that the ministry handle it. (5) The Shanghai County Tooth Tax Office forced brick and tile companies to receive two tax licenses. The industry association repeatedly requested that they still receive one license as before. We checked the original case approved in the previous year, in which they were temporarily allowed to receive one license, and sent telegrams to the ministry and departments for approval. As a result, we received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance last month, approving that the matter should still be handled in accordance with the previous case. (6) Jiangxi Province implemented a special tax on the production and sale of goods. The porcelain association of this city, as well as the various industry associations in Jiangxi Province and the porcelain merchants of Jingdezhen, stated that this production and sales tax was actually a disguised likin tax, and that porcelain ships were even detained and forced to pay donations on the way. We earnestly requested a remedy and repeatedly submitted reports to the Executive Yuan and the ministries, ordering its abolition. The chairman of the chamber and Wang, Standing Committee Member Yansong, along with representatives from the porcelain industry, visited Chairman Xiong in Jiangxi and repeatedly pleaded for relief. As a result, the tax rate was determined, and the porcelain merchants were allowed to handle the business tax themselves. (7) The Wusong branch office stated that the commerce in the town was booming in the spring and autumn seasons, relying entirely on the locals' own manpower and small carts to transport goods. Now, the Finance Bureau's Vehicle Donation Collection Office strictly collects donations, causing the small carts to avoid the vehicle donation and refrain from going to Wusong Town, causing commerce to decline. We earnestly requested a transfer to request exemption. The request was forwarded to the Municipal Government and approved, and the vehicle donation for the small carts was postponed for six months. (8) More than one hundred associations, including the paper industry, the woolen industry, and the mercerized cotton weaving industry, jointly stated that the Shangbao Stamp Tax Bureau's inspection of stamps exceeded the scope of authority, arbitrarily searched, and punished without legal basis, causing merchants and people to suffer. We requested that the current rules for punishing stamp tax violations be amended. Based on the Shandong Stamp Tax and Liquor Tax Bureau's document instructed by the Ministry of Finance, we submitted a report requesting that Article 4 of the Regulations of the Stamp Tax Adjudication Committee of Jiangsu Province be amended, granting merchants and people who have been punished for stamp tax violations the right to request the provincial bureau to issue a review. (9) Yin Jiayan, Zhu Wenrong, Yang Yongfu, and other merchants and people in the Yinxing District stated that members of the district's defense corps and police officers from the Public Security Bureau had clashed over a case. The merchants and people came forward to mediate, but were resented by the police, who arrested them everywhere. As the end of the year was approaching, the merchants and people fled to Shanghai and dared not return home. They appealed to the chamber to describe the true situation of the incident and submitted a report to the Municipal Government, as well as a letter to the Public Security Bureau, requesting that the matter be handled impartially. Later, the Municipal Government issued an order, stating that the director and patrol officer of the Seventh District had mishandled the matter and ordered the Public Security Bureau to severely punish them. The merchants and people were then able to return home for the New Year. (10) The Chinese General Chamber of Commerce in Sumatra stated that Liang Rongsun, the consul stationed in Medan, had used various pretexts to destroy the chamber's affairs and anger the overseas Chinese because his request for a loan was not granted. We earnestly requested that justice be upheld and that the station be withdrawn for investigation. We repeatedly telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, detailing the facts of Consul Liang's slander and requesting that he be replaced in order to rectify the discipline of diplomatic officials. Soon after, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs sent a telegram stating that Consul Liang had been dismissed for being greedy and derelict of duty. The above ten matters are a summary of the handling process, highlighting the ones with greater impact, in order to let the member representatives understand the actual situation of chamber affairs and to know that the relief of merchants' pain still requires constant effort. We hope to receive guidance and assistance in the future. However, there is one matter that is of great importance and must be reported separately: the entire assets of the Shanghai Arsenal are guaranteed by the chamber to inherit the previous General Chamber of Commerce's military advance payment of principal and interest of approximately 1 million yuan after the Qi-Lu War, holding the approval documents of the former Ministry of the Army and Ministry of Finance to allocate guarantees. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of Finance replied in a letter, approving the maintenance of the original letter, and the Executive Yuan was reported to have handled it as planned. However, on the sixteenth of this month, the Ministry of Military Affairs批issued a批saying that the Shanghai Arsenal is a central government industry and is managed by the Ministry, and no local civil or military officials may dispose of it. The so-called allocation as a loan guarantee is an illegal measure, and the Ministry should not hastily recognize it, etc. The chamber believes that this order destroys the previous loan case, which is a matter of great importance to credit, and in addition to rejecting the Ministry of Military Affairs, it also submitted a report to the lower court, requesting that the Ministry be ordered to perform the original case. At the same time, in the name of the chairman of the chamber, we detailed the establishment process of the guarantee case, citing laws and regulations, and based on the facts, sent separate letters to Chen Cixia, Deputy Minister of Military Affairs, and Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, earnestly requesting that the established case be maintained in order to consolidate credit. This is a rough outline of the chamber's efforts to fight for this loan. I have written this in detail for your information."</p>

<h3>Publication of Telegrams</h3>
<p>(1) To the Central Party Headquarters of Nanjing, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Southwest Political Committee, Mr. Hu Hanmin of Hong Kong, and Mr. Feng Huanzhang of Zhangjiakou: In recent years, party committees have each formed their own political groups and established their own systems. All their actions have not been based on the interests of the whole people. They have been quick to serve local interests and sectional divisions. The signs are obvious, and the authorities have not denied it. Although there is no formal split, they have become alienated in reality. Not only is there no organization to take advantage of the enemy, but politics can never be on track, military preparations can never be improved, and all rescue plans are based on the present situation and cannot be discussed. Four provinces have fallen in the past, and it is feared that the whole country will follow suit. Today, to save the country, we must first start with psychological transformation. All my party and national leaders should remember the difficulty of building the country and the urgency of foreign aggression. Over the years, national affairs have been ruined by suspicion and discord. One mistake is too much, and we must quickly unite in spirit, seek unification through construction. Power and position are not disdained by the wise, and the merits and demerits are left to future generations to judge. This is the urgent task of all of you today. In the past, the Ming Dynasty was destroyed, and the Donglin Fushe also disappeared with the country. Thinking of this, the mood can be calmed. National crisis comes first. I hereby express the sentiments of merchants and citizens based on the resolution of today's member representative conference. It is hoped that the party and national heroes will adopt it. Sincerely, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>
<p>(2) To the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Military Affairs of Nanjing: During the 14th year of the Republic of China, the Ministry of the Army and the Ministry of Finance of Beijing designated all the land and property of the Shanghai Arsenal as collateral for the former General Chamber of Commerce to pay for the demobilization of Han soldiers and the transportation of supplies. There were official letters and land deeds as proof. In May of the 18th year, the Ministry of Finance again reported to the Executive Yuan to maintain the case and ordered the Ministry of Military Affairs to inform the legal procedures. Everything was complete. Recently, there has been talk of selling the factory land, and the Ministry of Military Affairs suddenly said that it was inconvenient to recognize the previous agreement, violating legal principles and court orders, and damaging the country's credibility with merchants. Since hearing the news, business circles have been greatly shocked. This amount was collected by the Chamber of Commerce from various industries in small amounts, and mostly from public funds of trade associations. If the previous case is overturned, it is tantamount to confiscating the property of merchants and citizens. Therefore, in the name of today's member representative conference, it is resolved to telegraph the Executive Yuan and the Ministry to strictly follow the case to reassure the whole country. Sincerely, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce.</p>

The daily minting of new currency reaches hundreds of thousands of yuan. The Inspection Committee of the Central Mint has also carefully examined the weight and fineness in accordance with the provisions of the examination regulations, and they are all in accordance with the statutory requirements. It is specifically set to be issued on July 1st of this year. All receipts and payments of public and private funds and all transactions shall be exercised uniformly. In addition to reporting to the Executive Yuan through the Ministry for filing, it is necessary to announce it to all. Ministry of Finance, June 23rd, 22nd Year of the Republic of China."</p>
<p>Amid Economic Panic</p>
<h3>Sharp Reduction in Business on Two Railways</h3>
<p>A Shortfall of One Million Yuan in Four Months</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations, in view of the sharp reduction in business on the two railways, such as from January to April of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, compared with the same months of the 20th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway had a shortfall of more than 870,000 yuan, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway had a shortfall of more than 110,000 yuan, totaling nearly one million yuan for the two railways. As for the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, it is predicted that there will be a shortfall of 600,000 yuan in June. The reason is the economic downturn in various industries and the bankruptcy of the rural economy, resulting in a reduction in freight transportation. Director Huang Boqiao studied in detail and tried to find ways to remedy the situation, such as reducing freight rates for silkworm cocoons to promote transportation and increase revenue.</p>
<p>After the Weather Cleared</p>
<h3>Be Careful of Rising Water in the Yangtze River Region</h3>
<p>Due to Snowmelt Upstream, the High Tide Has Not Ended. The River Water Has Been Rising Sharply for Days. In Wuhan, the River Water in the Three Towns Has Reached the Shore. Several Sections of the Levees with Lower Construction Have Been Breached. If the River Water Continues to Rise, the Disaster of the Great Flood of the 20th Year of the Republic of China Will Be Repeated. The National Economic Commission Has Ordered the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to Be Responsible for Section-by-Section Prevention and Gun Safety. The Following Is a Report from the Engineering Office of the Association:</p>
<h3>Efforts to Prevent Disasters</h3>
<p>The Levees Along the Yangtze River Below Wuhan Have Been Raised Since the Great Flood of the 20th Year of the Republic of China to Prevent the Flood from Rushing In and Causing Disaster. The Highest Point of the Levee is 48 Feet. Since the 5th, Mildew Rain Has Continued. The Accumulated Snow in the Upper Reaches of Jianghan Has Melted, and the Water Level Has Been Rising Rapidly. According to the Latest Report, the River Water is Only About Six Inches Away from the Shore. Some of the Shorter Sections of the Levee Have Been Rushed In. Although the Weather Has Cleared at Present, the Snow Accumulated on the High Mountains Upstream is Melting Due to Weather Conditions. It is Predicted That the Jianghan Water Level May Still Rise. This Year's Water Level Has Exceeded the Record of the 20th Year of the Republic of China. If it Continues to Rise, No One Can Predict Whether a Flood Can Be Avoided. The Disaster Prevention Agency is Responsible and Should Do Its Best to Defend, But the Area Is Vast and the Project Is Not Easy. Fortunately, Local People Can Help With the Defense, So There Is No Difficulty in Supplying Materials for the Project.</p>
<h3>Downstream Is Critical</h3>
<p>The Upper Reaches of the Yangtze River (West of Yichang) Are Surrounded by High Mountains, and the River Flow Is Rapid. Because It Is the Snowmelt Season, the Snow Water Rushes Down and Will Irrigate the Yangtze River. Therefore, the Middle Reaches (From Yichang to Hankou) of the Yangtze River Have Risen Sharply. The River Surface in This Section Is Extremely Narrow and Is Also the Meeting Point of the Han River and the Xiang River, So It Cannot Be Discharged Downstream for a While, and the Rising Trend Is Worse. Since Hankou, Wuxue, and Below, the River Surface Is Wide and the Tributaries Are Relatively Sparse, and the Rising Trend Has Been Reduced. If the Upper Reaches Continue to Rise, the Lower Reaches, Which Are Flat, but the Levees Are Lower, Will Also Be Affected. The River Water in the Wuhu Area Has Already Reached the Shore.</p>
<h3>Section-by-Section Prevention</h3>
<p>The Higher the Levee Is Built, the Lower the Flat Land Inside the Levee Is. If the River Water Rises Indefinitely and Rushes In, the Disaster Will Be More Severe Than in the Previous Year. After the River Water Rushes In, It Is Not Easy to Discharge Due to the Low-Lying Inside the Levee. The Defense Project Has Been Divided Into Regions and Section-by-Section Prevention Has Been Made to Avoid Taking Care of One Thing and Losing Sight of Another.</p>

<h3>Sheshan Lighthouse Radio Beacon</h3>
<p>Broadcasting in Coordination with the Huaniao and Dajishan Radio Beacons</p>
<p>The beacon's wavelength is 1,000 meters with the call sign "○"</p>
<p>Jianghai Customs General Affairs Department Seamanship Division issued Announcement No. 1044, stating: Regarding the announcement, the Inspector General of Customs has opened, investigated, and found that the Sheshan Lighthouse under the jurisdiction of Jianghai Customs should be equipped with a radio beacon to facilitate navigation. All matters related to the installation should be listed separately and ordered to be followed by the Engineering Department. Therefore, this announcement is issued, and the order is transcribed below for the information of foreign merchants. This is specially announced, including: ㈠ Installation Location: Sheshan Lighthouse. ㈡ Installation Date: Around July 20th of this year. However, from July 20th to January 20th of the following year, it is a trial period. The broadcasting work may be intermittent, and no further announcements will be made. After the trial period, the beacon will be permanently installed, and no further announcements will be issued. ㈢ Beacon Characteristics: The beacon transmits using interrupted continuous waves with a wavelength of 1,000 meters. Its call sign is "○," transmitted repeatedly according to the Morse telegraph code for one minute and forty seconds. ㈣ Transmission Schedule: In hazy or foggy weather, the beacon signal is transmitted every six minutes, i.e., the transmission of the code () lasts one minute and forty seconds. The pause lasts four minutes and twenty seconds. The above signals are transmitted twice every hour according to China Coast Time (i.e., 120 degrees East longitude) at four minutes, ten minutes, sixteen minutes, twenty-two minutes, twenty-eight minutes, thirty-four minutes, etc. In clear weather, the beacon signal is transmitted twice every half hour, i.e., the transmission of the code () lasts one minute and forty seconds. The pause lasts four minutes and twenty seconds. The code () is transmitted again for one minute and forty seconds. The pause lasts twenty-two minutes and twenty seconds. The above signals are transmitted once every hour according to China Coast Time (i.e., 120 degrees East longitude), starting at four minutes and thirty-four minutes. ㈤ Other Matters: The Sheshan radio beacon will broadcast in coordination with the already installed Huaniao radio beacon (see Customs Seamanship Division Navigation Announcement No. 1040) and the Dajishan radio beacon (see Customs Seamanship Division Navigation Announcement No. 1039) to create a continuous system of operation for the three radio beacons. Each beacon's signal will be transmitted separately according to China Coast Time (i.e., 120 degrees East longitude). If the weather is hazy or foggy, the Huaniao radio beacon with the call sign "XNS" will transmit once every hour from zero to two minutes, i.e., the transmission of the code (·····) lasts one minute and forty seconds. The pause lasts twenty seconds. The Dajishan radio beacon with the call sign "Z" will transmit once every hour from two to four minutes, i.e., the transmission of the code (····) lasts one minute and forty seconds. The pause lasts twenty seconds. The above related signals are transmitted continuously every six minutes, i.e., starting at zero minutes, six minutes, twelve minutes, eighteen minutes, etc., of each hour. For the above three radio beacons, regardless of location, when transmitting hazy or foggy signals due to weather conditions, they can be initiated independently when necessary without acting in unison with the other two locations. In clear weather, the above related signals are transmitted only twice every half hour, i.e., continuing transmissions starting at zero minutes, six minutes, thirty minutes, and thirty minutes of each hour. ㈥ Relevant Charts: Hydrographic Charts of the Ministry of the Navy of the Republic of China Nos. 505 and 1011.</p>

<p>After the Death of Famous Doctor Qin Heqi</p>
<h3>Family Dispute over Inheritance</h3>
<p>Qin Meifang Claimed His Father Was Infected With Syphilis</p>
<p>None of the Others Were His Father's Biological Children</p>
<p>The Sealed Property Is Complex</p>
<p>After the death of Qin Heqi, a famous doctor specializing in injuries, his substantial estate and numerous children led to unequal distribution, resulting in litigation. The matter has been briefly reported. Qin had four sons and seven daughters. The eldest and second daughters were born to his first wife, Gu. Four daughters, namely the fourth, fifth, seventh, and ninth, and his son, Meifang, were born to his first concubine, Zhang. The remaining one daughter and three sons were born to his second concubine, Chen, and third concubine, Xia. The three sons, named Zhisheng, Zhiying, and Zhiren, since Qin took Chen as a concubine in the twelfth year of the Republic, the family lost harmony, and lawsuits were frequent. Their residence was originally on Gordon Road. At this time, Qin did not want to hear the sounds of discord every day, so he moved to Rue Amiral Courbet in the French Concession with Gu and Chen, one wife and one concubine, and built a separate residence on Chongqing Road to house Xia. Last winter, Gu died of illness, and Qin deeply mourned her death, causing his old illness to relapse. This spring, his illness worsened daily. On the night of the first day of the fourth month of the lunar calendar, in his dying moments, he summoned relatives to bid farewell. Meifang, born to Zhang, learned of this and rushed to Rue Amiral Courbet to carry Qin back to the old house on Gordon Road, where he soon passed away. Zhang and her son concealed the funeral and hastily seized property deeds. Later, Chen, Xia, and their children learned of the news and rushed to the old house to mourn, but were refused entry. Therefore, after the funeral, they hired lawyers Li Ni, Yang Ruinian, etc., to file a lawsuit against Zhang and Qin Meifang for property division and requested a preliminary declaration to attach the property. This has been approved. The properties on Gordon Road and Jiaozhou Road were sealed last month. Recently, Judge Yang of the First Special District Court summoned Qin Meifang for questioning. Qin Meifang also hired lawyer Jiang Yiping to defend, claiming that his mother, Zhang, was actually Heqi's wife, with a marriage certificate to prove it. Chen and others were merely in a cohabiting relationship. He was Heqi's son and had not been adopted, as evidenced by the family genealogy. Furthermore, all the others were not his father's biological children because his father suffered from syphilis and had lost the ability to have children long ago. Therefore, he requested confirmation that he was Heqi's biological son so that he could inherit the property according to law. Before this identity issue is resolved, all requests to analyze the estate should be suspended. The statements of both parties were held separately, and the content was extremely complex. The court adjourned for another hearing.</p>
<p>The Corpse is Not Yet Cold</p>
<h3>The Widow and Children Have Already Been Deceived</h3>
<p>The Son-in-law and Nephew of Huang Have Engaged in Embezzlement</p>
<p>Ge Peiyuan, the local owner of the Five Millet Rice Shop at 39 Tiantong Road, is the son-in-law of the late Huang Jinhe, while Huang Maolin, the owner of the Mao Da Foreign Goods Store at 412 Route Robert, is Huang Jinhe's nephew. Jinhe was quite wealthy before his death, having married one wife and one concubine. His wife, Liu, only had one daughter, who married Ge. His concubine, Yang, gave birth to a son named Yongling, who is now only six years old. On January 27th of this year, Jinhe passed away. The evidence of his property was originally placed at his concubine Yang's residence on Qipu Road. The entire family, wanting to dispose of the estate, immediately</p>
<h3>Held a Post-Mortem Meeting</h3>
<p>It was decided to appoint Ge Peiyuan, Huang Maolin, Fei Kuisheng, and Fei Runsheng as the four property custodians, and a custody agreement was signed, stating that all property would be kept by the custodians until Jinhe's son, Yongling, turned twenty. Yang's brother, Yang Fengchun, and other relatives, Sheng Zhongheng and Yang Zuoyao, were invited to witness the agreement. Three copies of the agreement were held by each of the four custodians, and one copy was held by Huang Liu. Yang was immediately ordered to hand over all title deeds, receipts, deposit receipts, IOUs, etc.,</p>
<h3>To the Custodians</h3>
<p>To be sent to the Associated Banking Corporation for safekeeping. If withdrawal was required, it needed the joint signature of the custodians and Yongling. Yongling's seal was also decided by public vote to be kept by his biological mother, Yang. However, just after the deeds were deposited on February 21st, they were suddenly withdrawn completely on March 20th, claiming that a title deed was needed to exchange the business license at the Land Bureau. But it has been three months, the business license has not been obtained, and all the deeds have not been sent back to the bank for safekeeping. Huang Yang, seeing this sneaky trick, feared that</p>
<h3>The Property Would Be Reduced to Nothing</h3>
<p>She, on the night of the 16th, questioned her son-in-law Ge Peiyuan and nephew Huang Maolin, telling them that the deceased's bones were not yet cold, and they should not act on their own initiative and change the agreed-upon arrangements, betraying the deceased's trust. Unexpectedly, Ge and others repeatedly deceived Yang for being weak and ignorant, and Yongling for being young and without knowledge, scolding and abusing the mother and son. Afterwards, they falsely accused them at the Huisi Police Station.</p>
<h3>Standard System Must Be Used for Weights and Measures</h3>
<p>Order from the Ministry of Interior to be followed by health and other organizations.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Medical Association recently received a dispatch from the Social Affairs Bureau forwarded by the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Interior, stating that medical institutions, schools at all levels, and sports organizations currently use the Imperial system for weights and measures, such as pounds for weight and miles or feet for length. Even when using the metric system, the names are often incorrect, such as calling meters "mi" instead of "gongchi" (metric meter) and calling grams "wa" or "ke" instead of "gongfen" (metric gram). This clearly contradicts the regulations of the Weights and Measures Law. Strict enforcement is necessary to achieve uniformity. In the future, all medical institutions, schools, and sports organizations must use the standard system, i.e., the metric system, for body examinations or sports equipment and their names. All original Imperial system equipment should be eliminated to comply with the law. A corresponding letter is issued for notification and compliance to facilitate the administration of weights and measures.</p>
<p>Dutch Java</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Delegation Visited Beijing Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>A group of eight people, including Ye Weiheng of the Dutch National Salvation Relief Association, overseas Chinese merchants Shi Ruizhen, Chen Ruiji, Shi Weikang, and Mrs. Xu, organized a Nanyang Dutch Java Overseas Chinese Industrial Delegation to return to China for investigation to understand the industrial situation of the motherland. The delegation took a boat from Java to Hong Kong some time ago and transferred to Shanghai. They stayed at the Dadong Hotel on Nanjing Road. All the members visited Hangzhou and returned to Shanghai the day before yesterday. It is learned that the delegation took the Beijing-Shanghai Express to Beijing at 7:00 yesterday morning. Wang Peiyuan, medical director of the Chinese Red Cross Society, and others came to the station to see them off. It is reported that the delegation plans to stay in Beijing for a week to conduct investigations before taking a boat to Japan, the Philippines, and other places before returning to Java.</p>

<h3>Deceiving the Widow and Children</h3>
<p>The atmosphere of greed was burning hot. Yang was indignant and decided to resort to the law, filing a lawsuit against Ge and Huang with the First Special District Court for breach of trust, requesting punishment according to the law to deter cunning. On Saturday afternoon, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court to hear the case. All those listed in the custody agreement, except the two defendants, were subpoenaed to appear in court to testify. At the appointed time, only Yang's brother, Yang Fengchun, appeared in court. The others, Fei Kuisheng, Fei Runsheng, Sheng Zhongheng, Yang Zuoyao, and Huang Liu, all suspected of protecting the defendants and being in cahoots, evaded appearance. The plaintiff, Huang Yang, first</p>
<h3>Explained the Facts of the Matter</h3>
<p>Her lawyer, Peng Qi, supplemented that the defendants, under the pretext of adjusting the business license, took away all the deeds and boxes. If they were really adjusting the business license, it would have been sufficient to take the relevant title deed. This proves that the defendants had other intentions. When questioned, both defendants claimed that the deeds were now in Huang Liu's hands and denied having a custody agreement. Yang Fengchun then presented a partially copied paper from the original agreement, stating that this was a draft he wrote at the time. Although it was not complete,</p>
<h3>Even This Fragment</h3>
<p>Could prove the viciousness of their methods and the bias of their actions between the lines. After inspecting this fragment of the agreement, Judge Wu understood that the custody agreement was indeed a fact. He criticized the defendants for continuing to evade and deny the facts in court. He was greatly angered and sternly rebuked them, saying that he had hoped they would not betray the trust of the deceased and would keep the property until Yongling turned twenty. Now, only a few months later, they had hidden the agreement. What were their intentions? Both defendants bowed their heads and had nothing to say, appearing meek and frightened. The plaintiff's lawyer immediately requested that the defendants be released on bail. Judge Wu immediately approved the request, ruling that Ge Peiyuan and Huang Maolin each pay a bond of 500 yuan, and adjourned for another hearing.</p>

<p>Fang Zhenwu</p>
<h3>Sent a Telegram for Apprehension in the Yang Case</h3>
<p>General Fang Zhenwu of Chahar Province was greatly angered after hearing about the assassination of Yang Xingfo. He sent a telegram to the whole country, asking to uphold humanity and do everything possible to apprehend the murderer. The original telegram is recorded below (title omitted): Having read the newspaper report that Mr. Yang Xingfo was assassinated in Shanghai, the terrible news came, and I was deeply shocked. Under the flag of the clear sky and white sun, axes and shadows flickered, and ambushes were rampant. With no discipline, what kind of system is this? In addition to sending a telegram to console Mr. Yang Xiaofo to restrain his grief, I specially request that humanity be upheld and all efforts be made to apprehend the murderer, bring him to justice, and appease the ghost, without delay. Fang Zhenwu bows, Ma.</p>
<h3>Enthusiastic Participation in the Qingdao National Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Qingdao Municipal Government, in order to promote the national goods and national salvation movement, held a national goods exhibition and specially sent Mr. Fu Gentian to Shanghai to consult with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to collect new and innovative national goods from various industries and factories to participate. The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products and the Chinese National Products Maintenance Association were appointed to be responsible for the event. The two associations have repeatedly convened meetings, appointed personnel from various departments, actively prepared, collected separately, and advertised in various newspapers. It is learned that the national goods factories are very enthusiastic about participating in this Qingdao National Exhibition because it coincides with the North China Games, which are also being held in Qingdao. The Qingdao ladies will be more numerous than usual. As of yesterday, the number of registrants at the two associations has exceeded the original quota. Since the opening date of the exhibition is approaching, the two associations urgently need to discuss important matters and conduct reviews. Therefore, it was decided to convene the second preparatory committee at the Zhengyi Society at noon today to jointly discuss and resolve the progress, so as to participate as scheduled and jointly achieve this grand event.</p>
<h3>National Products Association Discussed Participating in the Weihaiwei Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for the Promotion of National Products received a public letter No. 110 from the Weihaiwei Management Office, which stated: In response to your association's letter No. 5705 from Chiang, inquiring about the methods of the National Products Exhibition and requesting instructions. Having received this, a license for tax exemption and reduced transportation fees has been issued by the Ministry on the 13th of this month. Certificates of tax exemption and transportation fee reduction slips for railways and ships have been sent with the letter. The venue has been drawn and sent with the letter. At a minimum, it can accommodate more than 100 factories and has considerable expansion space. The subsidy from this office can be handled by referring to the Qingdao precedent. The preparatory procedures shall be determined by the preparatory committee. It is hoped that your association will quickly appoint two people to Weihaiwei to discuss everything to facilitate progress. In addition to a telegram response, a corresponding letter is sent for your information. After receiving the letter, the association will wait for a discussion by the Standing Committee before appointing representatives to Weihaiwei for negotiations.</p>
<h3>Cereal Industry Rectifying Domestic Wheat</h3>
<p>Foreign Wheat Arrives Continuously</p>
<p>Farmers Should Improve</p>
<p>Most of the members of the Shanghai Cereal, Oil Cake Trade Association are engaged in the cereal business. In recent years, due to the sale of foreign wheat in Shanghai, domestic wheat from Jiangbei has become unsuitable for use, and the outflow of profits is regrettable. After receiving reports from its members, the Cereal Association convened a meeting to maintain domestic production and rectify the situation. It specially organized a wheat group and a wheat research association. Wheat transported from various producing areas must first be inspected and qualified before it can be sold. The association also notified its counterparts in various producing areas and traders, instructing farmers not to add water or mix mud into the wheat and to thoroughly reform the goods. Yesterday, a meeting of counterparts was specially convened to discuss rectification measures. When the cereal industry was at its peak, the annual sales of wheat amounted to more than 10 million yuan. However, since the import and sale of foreign wheat, domestic wheat has deteriorated, and sales have gradually decreased, leading to the extinction of farmers' livelihoods. After discussion, now that new wheat is arriving in large quantities, the wheat research association is notified to inspect the goods. If there are goods that are watered or mixed with mud, unqualified goods, or damp, hairy, or impure goods, they will be identified, and the samples will be handed over to the wheat group for joint review. If unqualified, the goods will be returned and not sold by the traders. Counterparts who go to the producing areas to handle goods must also pay special attention so that farmers dare not add water or mix mud. Only in this way can domestic production be improved, and the source of foreign wheat can be cut off without resistance. The association will issue another warning to counterparts in various places, urging farmers and traders to implement rectification measures.</p>
<p>Military Officers from Ma and Su Departments</p>
<h3>Resolved to Go North to Reorganize Troops</h3>
<p>Have Telegraphed Ma and Su and Requested Instructions to Comply</p>
<p>Since Ma Zhanshan, chairman of Heilongjiang Province, and Su Bingwen, commander-in-chief of the Anti-Japanese Army, returned from overseas, their former troops stationed on the Chahar border and in Xinjiang have repeatedly telegraphed Ma and Su, requesting them to go north to take charge of everything in order to continue the anti-Japanese resistance. However, Ma and Su themselves, after meeting with Chairman Chiang, still need to rest in Lushan for some time before they can make a decision. Therefore, they first sent military commander Tai Binshan to Shanghai, who convened a meeting of military officers from the Ma and Su departments stationed in Shanghai yesterday to discuss the matter. As a result, it was decided that one or two people would remain in Shanghai to handle everything, and the remaining personnel stationed in Shanghai would be allowed to go north first to reorganize their troops. After the decision was made, a telegram was immediately sent to Ma and Su requesting instructions. As soon as a reply is received in Shanghai, they will set off to the north.</p>
<h3>Shangsong Company Stopped Collecting Tolls</h3>
<p>Collected Tolls Were Ordered to be Returned</p>
<p>The Shangsong Highway from Beiqiao to Songjiang was built by the two counties through requisitioned labor. A merchant-organized Shangsong Long-Distance Bus Company operates long-distance buses. After the company started operating, it collected tolls on the road. All vehicles other than those of the company had to pay one yuan to the company each time they used the road. However, this action was not approved by the local government, and it involved the private collection of taxes. Local groups opposed it. Later, Zhao Zukang, standing committee member of the Five Provinces Highway Committee, raised a question, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government ordered the Shanghai County Government to order the company to immediately stop collecting tolls and to issue a notice to investigate the facts and report them. The collected fees should be returned to the original owners. Last week, the county government followed the order and complied. The company has also stopped collecting this toll. However, because not all payers have come to claim the refunds, they have not yet been fully reimbursed.</p>
<h3>Municipal Federation Branch Inspected Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>The Second Branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation held its fourth executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Zheng Dongshan, Chen Jinzhang, Zhang Guoying, Zhang Maosheng, Ge Futian, Chen Shude, Fei Shenzhai, and more than ten other people attended. Zhang Guoying was elected chairman. ㈠ Inspecting enemy goods to show economic severance and adhering to the end, it was resolved: (A) To organize an enemy goods inspection committee; (B) To elect Zheng Dongshan, Chen Jinzhang, Zhang Guoying, and Wu Ziliang as inspection committee members; (C) To start the inspection immediately and notify all departments and stores; (D) To seal up any enemy goods found in the stores; (E) To issue certificates after inspection to prove it; (F) To handle the inspection work in conjunction with the general association. ㈡ Assisting the case of collecting donations beyond the boundary on North Sichuan Road, it was resolved: To request the general association to uphold justice. The meeting adjourned at 4 pm.</p>
<h3>Chinese Industrial Factory Stopped Operations and Liquidated, Paying Wages</h3>
<p>Lawyer Tong Yuwen Liquidating</p>
<p>The Chinese Industrial Factory on Baileinan Road, Caojiadu, Shanghai West, due to declining business and excessive losses, could not continue to operate. It stopped operations on the first of this month. All the male and female workers, concerned about their livelihood, demanded that the factory continue to operate, but to no avail, resulting in a dispute. It was sent to the party and government agencies to send personnel to mediate, but it was ineffective. This has been reported previously. It is now learned that the factory, after being discussed at a board meeting, has decided to suspend operations for a long period, and all workers will be dismissed, with each person receiving a certain amount of subsidy, depending on the length of time they worked. As the factory urgently needs to liquidate and close, it has entrusted lawyer Tong Yuwen to start the liquidation. Yesterday, lawyer Tong notified all workers to quickly go to the original address of the company's wholesale department in Baowanfang on Nanjing Road to collect their wages within the notice period. The notice is transcribed below: For the announcement, the Chinese Industrial Co., Ltd. has been declared dissolved, and this lawyer has been elected by the shareholders' meeting as the liquidator to handle the liquidation matters. All outstanding procedures of the company should also be handled by this liquidation office according to law. Upon taking over the files, the factory workers had already been reported by the company to the Social Affairs Bureau on the 8th of this month for dismissal. In addition to the original part of the workers who were given prior notice of dismissal, the factory will issue subsidies to all workers until the 15th of this month. This liquidation office is now urgently seeking to conclude the current affairs of the company in order to proceed with the liquidation. It has, in accordance with Articles 27 and 29 of the Factory Law, settled the wages for the notice period that each worker should receive. Therefore, all workers are notified to go to the original address of the company's wholesale department in Baowanfang on Nanjing Road within ten days starting from June 16th to collect the above-mentioned wages for the notice period, so as to conclude the matter. Please do not delay and cause yourself inconvenience.</p>
<p>After the French Mail Ship Hit a Reef</p>
<h3>Passengers and Mail Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Delayed Due to Fog Encountered by Lighter in Mid-Journey</p>
<p>The Ship Remains at the Original Site for Repairs</p>
<p>The French Mail Ship Company's Marseille-bound Arimistis mail ship, which encountered fog and hit a reef in the Putuo waters off Zhejiang Province on the morning of the 23rd of this month, has been salvaged after plugging the hole, but remains anchored near the island. Passengers and mail arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon. The ship is being repaired. Details are noted below.</p>
<h3>Passengers Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The British firm Butterfield &amp; Swire's lighter, Ai Lai Changdala, dispatched by the Shanghai French Mail Company for rescue, first transported 101 passengers, luggage, and mail to Shanghai the day before yesterday, scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 9 pm that night. Unexpectedly, it encountered fog after departing, causing it to be delayed until 11 am yesterday morning when it entered the Wusongkou, and finally arrived at the new customs pier at 12:15 pm. The company's special commissioner was at the pier to take care of the situation.</p>
<h3>Repairs in Progress</h3>
<p>The Arimistis remains anchored next to Simitipu Island. The French warships Balimaga and Alguo are also anchored next to the ship for protection. As for the engineers from the Erban Mieriasi and the Sino-French Qiuxin Factory, Baibu, and the laborers who went to survey, they all remained on the mail ship. The hole in the fourth cargo hold that hit the reef is being repaired. If the repairs are successful, it will be sailed to Shanghai immediately to unload 3,400 pieces of cargo before entering the Japanese shipyard or departing on schedule between Shanghai and Marseille. However, as of last night, the Shanghai company had not received a telegram regarding the extent of the repairs.</p>
<p>British Public Bus</p>
<h3>Ticket Sellers Automatically Rectify Bad Habits</h3>
<p>Organizing the Business Improvement Self-Governance Association</p>
<p>The Company Authorities Have Given Their Support</p>
<p>Dagon Society reports that the British China Public Bus Company is financially sound and large-scale, employing more than 1,000 workers, with ticket sellers accounting for more than 400. Their treatment is quite harsh. Last year, they requested the company to increase wages but were not approved, resulting in a strike. The company suffered considerable losses. Moreover, due to low salaries, the ticket sellers often engaged in fraudulent activities, causing even more intangible losses to the company. Now, the ticket sellers believe that defrauding fares is detrimental to their character. Therefore, they have decided to both request the company to improve their treatment and automatically rectify and eliminate the bad habit of "skimming oil." Gu Guanlin No. 6, Li Guangyu Wang Xilin No. 105, Ren Heming No. 228, and others initiated the organization of a ticket seller business improvement self-governance association, formulated rules, and engaged in rectification. After negotiating with the company authorities, they agreed to provide support. If the results are good, they will decide to increase wages and improve treatment. The rules are recorded below: ㈠ After joining the association, members should behave themselves and set an example. They should not engage in any more private fraud. If discovered, they will be subject to the following penalties: first warning, second warning, third expulsion from the association, and report to the company authorities for handling. ㈡ Members are responsible for supervising each other and must not violate the association rules due to personal relationships. ㈢ If the rules of this association are not perfect, they can be amended at any time.

<p>Creditors of the Riyue Bank Urge Auction of Huang Chu-jiu's Estate. After the Riyue Bank and the Great World Amusement Savings Department went bankrupt after the death of their founder, Huang Chu-jiu, the creditors filed lawsuits in the former French Concession Court. After allocating 20% of the debt amount, there were still debts that had not been allocated for a long time. Before the Dragon Boat Festival, the creditors urgently needed money and entrusted lawyer Yan Luqing to file a lawsuit with the Second Special District Local Court, requesting the speedy auction of Huang Chu-jiu's estate in order to compensate the creditors as soon as possible. However, after more than a month, the court had not yet held an auction. The creditors specially entrusted lawyer Yan to file another petition, the main idea of which was to urge the speedy auction of Huang Chu-jiu's estate to compensate the creditors. Since the filing of this case, nearly three years have passed, and the poor and helpless creditors have only received 20% from the former French Concession Court. Since the case was taken over by your court, it has been two years, and no money has been returned. The petitioners urgently needed money before the Dragon Boat Festival, but Huang Chu-jiu's real estate has been delayed in being auctioned. Moreover, Huang's real estate has been mortgaged. The only thing that ordinary creditors can hope for is the remaining amount after the auction price offsets the mortgage. The sooner the remaining amount is returned depends on when your court holds the auction. The petitioners have repeatedly filed petitions urging the auction before the Dragon Boat Festival, but your court has not actively proceeded. Therefore, they specially filed another petition, requesting your court to consider the petitioners' extreme poverty, speed up the auction, and no longer delay.</p>

<p>Communist Suspect Detained in Panic Attempts Suicide, Injured and Sent to Hospital for Treatment. According to a tip-off received by Wen Hongen, Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, several communists were plotting wrongdoing in a certain place. He immediately sent officers to arrest a suspect named Zheng Ming and took him to the first squadron of the Investigation Brigade for detention. Unexpectedly, Zheng attempted suicide at about 11 o'clock the night before, using a foreign nail from the detention center to hammer it into the wall, and violently撞ing his head against the door, immediately causing blood to flow like a river. The guard soldier Guo Zhenshan caught a glimpse of this and immediately reported it to the head of the accommodation section, Lin Kechang, who immediately sent Zheng to Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>

<p>The Beginning of a Coffee Factory Created by Chinese People Can Be Realized Next Spring. Coffee beverages have been selling very well in China in recent years, but they are all imported, resulting in huge losses every year. Recently, overseas Chinese Huang from Java and others, in view of this, plan to set up a coffee factory in Shanghai in order to recover the rights and interests. Huang returned to China and arrived in Shanghai at the end of last month and immediately went to the Guidance Section of the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry to inquire about the situation and request guidance. The director of the section, Ji Jinze, collected information on the number of coffee sales in China over the years and the main points of establishing a coffee factory and handed it over to Huang. According to Ji Jinze, the reporter of the Central News Agency, Ji Jun has discussed the points shown with Cantonese businessmen in this city and has made a decision. They are now raising funds and preparing separately, and it is expected that it can be realized next spring. This is indeed the beginning of a coffee factory created by Chinese people.</p>

<p>Lu Ge Ruizhen Denies Establishing Lu Zongyuan as Heir and Sues the Court to Confirm No Mother-Son Relationship. Lu Xiting, a local resident living at No. 300 Qipu Road, forcibly adopted his only son, Zongyuan, as the son of his widowed sister-in-law, Lu Ge Ruizhen, hoping to inherit the property, but Lu Ge Ruizhen absolutely did not admit it. He has now hired lawyers Wang Chang and Wu Kun to sue Lu Xiting and his son in the First Special District Local Court, requesting confirmation that there is no mother-son relationship with Zongyuan. He said that his deceased parents-in-law, Lu Xitai and Lu Zhou, only had one son, named Yongchang. In the second year of the Republic of China, he married the plaintiff as his wife. Two months after the wedding, Yongchang passed away. Therefore, the deceased father-in-law chose Xiting, the son of his younger brother Hengfu, to succeed him. The deceased father-in-law's estate was inherited separately by the plaintiff and Xiting. Recently, in order to manage debts, he sold the real estate on Qipu Road left by his late husband to Hengyu Company. However, Xiting tried to get involved in the property price obtained by the plaintiff, claiming that his only son, Zongyuan, had inherited and succeeded the plaintiff. Therefore, he filed a lawsuit in the name of Zongyuan against Hengyu Company to confirm that the deed of sale was invalid. The only evidence was Lu Xitai's will. The original text of this will had not been seen by the plaintiff before, so there was no way to know its authenticity. Although the content stated that the first grandson born by Xiting in the future would be归ed to Yongchang, according to the laws at the time, the right to choose an heir was exclusively vested in the woman who kept her chastity, and the elders could not choose an heir on behalf of the woman who kept her chastity. That is, the will was indeed true and the heir was established in advance without the plaintiff's consent, which was also inconsistent with the law. Moreover, if there is no son to establish an heir, it must be agreed by both the successor and the heir before it can take effect. If the heir has no intention of establishing an heir, it is difficult to force the establishment of a succession relationship based solely on the actions of the successor. Zongyuan is Xiting's only son, and according to the law, he cannot succeed to another family. The plaintiff, of course, does not want to cut off Xiting's descendants. Therefore, since Zongyuan was born, there has never been any act of establishing an heir, nor has a succession document been signed. As for兼祧, it is even more necessary to have the consent of both parties and the甘結 of the clan. Since the plaintiff did not agree to the defendant's establishment of an heir, there is no question of willingness to 兼祧. It is obvious that there is no mother-son relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff. However, the defendant arbitrarily interfered with the plaintiff's disposal of property, which easily caused misunderstandings. The system of establishing an heir has a long history, but the world is often used as a means to compete for property, neglecting filial piety and sacrifices. Therefore, the National Government promulgated the Inheritance Law of the Civil Code and resolutely abolished the inheritance of ancestral temples. This lawsuit is to prevent the competition for property, and it is also a sigh for the legacy of establishing an heir. Therefore, I扶病起訴状 to request a summons trial to determine that there is no mother-son relationship between the defendant and the plaintiff, etc. Yesterday, Judge Mo Runhua of the First Special Court opened a court hearing. The plaintiff insisted that he never admitted Zongyuan's establishment as an heir, while the defendant said that the act of establishing an heir was carried out in accordance with Lu Xitai's will and invited Yu +, who participated in Xitai's funeral affairs that year, to testify in court. Judge Mo ordered a reschedule for another hearing as the case still needed investigation.</p>

<p>Dispute over the Sale of Houses in Hou Deli. Tao Rangqing (also known as Tao Jinji) from Chuansha recently purchased 17 houses located at No. 1678 Meicetao Road, Hou Deli, Gansu Road from Yu Wenhua, a local resident, for a price of 40,500 taels of silver. The transaction was completed on May 27. After the transfer of ownership, on the 5th of this month, lawyer Lin Yingqing was entrusted to issue a notice, ordering the tenants in the lane to move out of the houses in order to rebuild them, and five Jinji boundary stones were sent to replace them. Unexpectedly, the old owner, Yu Wenhua, instructed Qian Ali, a Jiangbei native who was looking after the gate, to tear down the notice and destroy four of the boundary stones. On the 10th of this month, he posted a notice himself, saying that recently some unscrupulous people had been collecting rent under false pretenses, but the owner had sold the property and, according to a statement in the owner's letter, had not yet transferred the property rights. Therefore, the matter had been sued in court, requesting a legal solution. During the pending litigation, the rent would still be collected by this accounting room. At that time, Tao Rangqing went to question him and扭扭ed Qian Ali into the police station. The police chief said that it was a dispute over the sale of real estate and ordered him to sue in court. Tao still hired lawyer Lin Yingqing and filed a criminal lawsuit against Yu Wenhua and Qian Ali, accusing them of defamation and destruction in the First Special District Court. Yesterday, Judge Liu Yugui visited the Fifth Criminal Court for research. The plaintiff, Tao Rangqing, complained that Qian Ali said at the time that tearing up the notice and destroying the boundary stones were all done on the orders of the owner, and he presented the torn notice for inspection, and requested to attach part of the civil suit to demand compensation for this month's rent of 522 yuan and the boundary stone fee of 20 yuan. When questioned, the defendants denied tearing up the notice and destroying the boundary stones, and hired a lawyer to appear in court and stated that the property had been mortgaged to Changgu Real Estate Company. At that time, the plaintiff paid the款, which was deducted by the company, leaving only more than 200 taels, and the Xiehe Qianzhuang came forward as the buyer. The plaintiff was欺騙ive. A criminal lawsuit was filed in your court before, but although the result was not established, the civil case was still in progress. Then, the plaintiff's lawyer submitted the defendant's sales receipt and receipt簽辽据, and the witness Ye Fanglin testified that the property was成交ed at Changfeng Company. At that time, both parties were in the accounting room, and Tao Rangqing paid the silver to Yu Wenhua, and Yu转付ed it to Changfeng. The procedures were quite clear. Finally, 　造律帥互　 concluded, and the official谕 scheduled a sentence.</p>

In accordance with the elementary school curriculum guidelines, the association provides introductory classes for Grade 3 and above.

The material for this competition consists of 100 characters, with 50 characters used to form 25 words. The words are connected into five sentences.

Except for a few common characters used in everyday speech, the characters chosen are ones that elementary third grade students have already learned. The pronunciations of the various characters encompass all thirty-seven phonetic symbols. Each symbol appears twice to twenty-five times.

Fortunately, the Chinese players are cautious.

Philippine Tennis Star Performance, Day Three, Lin and Zheng Lost in Doubles as Well, Two Philippine Generals, Lin Baohua Re-Challenges Jia Weiya to a Tie, Bao Lindan Loses to Machida Again, Leaving Shanghai for Japan on Thursday Philippine tennis champion Jia Weiya and his partner Bao Lindan gave their third performance at the Shanghai Grass Tennis Club. Jia Weiya was originally scheduled to play against Qiu Feihai but the order was changed temporarily. It was initially intended to have him play against Zheng Zhaojia but it was then decided that he and Lin Baohua would play a set. The result was a tie. In the singles match between Machida and Bao Lindan, Machida won 2-0. In the final doubles match, Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia also beat Jia Weiya and Bao Lindan 2-0. The results of the three matches are as follows: Lin Baohua 3-6, 6-0 Jia Weiya Machida 6-4, 6-3 Bao Lindan Lin Baohua 6-4 Jia Weiya Zheng Zhaojia 6-1 Bao Lindan The Competition Was Tedious and Boring Yesterday's competition was the most tasteless and boring of the three days of performances. The two Philippine generals had been fighting for three consecutive days and were exhausted. After one set, Bao Lindan seemed completely exhausted. After the first set, Jia Weiya stopped the match because he was too tired. One could say that it was not a very exciting show. It was only the doubles match that was interesting. Leaving for Japan on Thursday Jia Weiya and Bao Lindan's competition in Shanghai has come to an end. After resting for three days, they will leave for Japan on Thursday. However, based on the skill of the two, Jia Weiya may still be able to compete. Bao Lindan, however, is unlikely to put up much of a fight in Japan. With so many talented people in Japan, he can only fight with their fifth or sixth rate players. Lin Baohua and Jia Weiya Three to six, six to zero Jia Weiya came from behind Jia came to Shanghai and lost to Qiu but won against Lin. Lin had the shame of losing. At the start, Lin demonstrated willpower and showed his talents, hitting the left and right corners of the court, and won the first game. A victor will inevitably be high spirited. In the second round, Lin played calmly and strategically, causing Jia to be in a difficult situation. In the fourth game, Lin took the win and in the fifth game, he fought hard and took the victory. The last game was done in the blink of an eye. In the second round, Lin won six clean games with little effort. Machida defeated Bao Lindan Six to four, Six to three Machida and Bao Lindan then played a singles match. Machida has improved his skills over the last three years and yesterday's victory was a testament to his great skill. The two were evenly matched. Machida was only slightly better. The match was boring. Machida won the first set with a score of 6 to 4 and the second set 6 to 3. Bao Lindan had to give up because of his inability to score. Lin and Zheng won the final doubles match Six to four, Six to one Lin Baohua and Zheng Zhaojia were then able to win the next match. The match was still boring. Zheng Zhaojia made a lot of service errors in the first set, but was able to improve in the second set. In the Philippine players, the situation grew worse. Zheng Zhaojia was able to serve the ball near the edges of the court and win the points. The London World's Longest Race 104 Miles in 18 Hours, 53 Minutes, 7 Seconds (Reuters, London, 24th) The world's longest race was held today, from London to Brighton and back to London, a total of 104 miles.

The Donghua Football Team's Philippine Campaign, First Match Draw with Spain, Last Match Lost 0-1 (Special Correspondent Wenchu from Manila) The Donghua football team has fought against the strong enemies after the oath, and the first five battles were all victories. The excellence of the entire team's football skills and the noble actions have left a deep impression on the Chinese and foreign people here. It has increased the glory of the overseas Chinese and improved the international status a lot. Yesterday was the sixth game, which was the last battle in the Philippines. The opponent was Spain. This battle was not ordinary. In the event that Donghua wins, it can protect the title of the ever-victorious army. In the event that Spain is victorious, it can win the beauty of the Philippine football world. Since the competition is very serious, both sides have decided to use all their strength. After a general, the players repeatedly observed the Donghua combat plan and were convinced that they had hoped to defeat Donghua today. The overseas Chinese women mostly came to help the team. Today there are the best performances. Therefore, the seats in the audience are crowded and extremely tense. When the sound of the silver flute reached the enemy's ear at five o'clock, it had the advantage of being against the sun and downwind. Donghua was also attacking several times. The audience was a bit shocked. With Donghua being down by zero to one, Donghua’s team was stronger and launched a large-scale attack. Therefore, after the first half, Donghua won one to zero. No goals were made. During a very intense battle, the referee penalized them with a twelve-yard penalty. It was too late. The spirit has not yet fully recovered. Therefore, the goal was not made in the city gate. After not being able to attack, they gave up the opportunity automatically. Lin Zheng won at last 6-4. This was the first time. The number of shots that Zheng Zhaojia had missed in the first round was innumerable. During the second game, there was slight progress made, but the success was still difficult. Jia and his team are in a situation of constant trouble, not being able to advance. In the past, the team would have taken on a more aggressive stance. Donghua won by a score of 1 to 0. Since then, the silver award, which had been suspended for a long time, had been won by our army. From the number of battles, the soldiers used collaboration in a smart manner so that there were great honors and victories. The enthusiasm was great. There are a number of people that have not returned to collect. The Shanghai municipal government and local community were eager to make plans to meet to discuss this issue.</p>

<p>Of Venomous Words and Poisoned Arrows Little One I went to the [XX Market] and came back丨It's been a long time since I stepped into a movie theater. Of course, this is because I'm watching the poor, but running around tired all day, even if I have money, I don't have the time or energy to buy that temporary happiness丨No, maybe it's temporary anesthesia. Therefore, I know that the words [busy being poor] are the most ticklish to me; I also understand that in the dictionary of a poor person's life, apart from busy being poor, there is absolutely no such term as [entertainment]. My friends on summer vacation are sure to squeeze into my small house every day to have a good time. Today, they advocated going to the company to watch a movie, and asked me to participate丨No, they didn't even give me time to refuse, and finally they dragged me into [Star] in a kidnapping manner. 丨What is showing here is the domestic sound film [XX Market], which is exposing the dark secrets and crises of women's jobs丨The screenwriter very smoothly assumed two beautiful female clerks with absolutely different temperaments in the story, one of whom gained the love of the company supervisor because of her flirtatious charm丨No, it's actually a prostitution deal, and she lives in a gorgeous and exquisite Western-style house (this is my understanding, because in today's society, a single female clerk relies solely on her legitimate income, and besides decorating herself, she can live in such a big house without going hungry, which is really unique丨)··Another one was unfortunately shattered because she firmly rejected the despicable and beast-like pursuit of the [manager's son]. ····Finally, the screenwriter so smoothly preached to the unfortunate girl··[Be brave, leave this den of beasts, you still have your paradise! Remember·[Suffering ends] will naturally [sweetness comes].] So she prepared to suffer, she went to [pick tea], she went to [connect lines], and she also worked as a female secretary; slowly, she actually took two hundred yuan to the bank to save, and finally she started her own [shop] smoothly as a [boss]. So she gave her old lover丨the old lover with a wife and children read with envy and admiration [It's really not easy!]丨Maybe everyone in this society reads it like this. Regarding the criticism of this film, Cong said that many [film critics] had given detailed reviews during the premiere at [New Light]·So here, I don't need to say any more about the skills and performances, I just feel that··the exposure in the first half is too excessive, and the preaching at the end is not enough, and it is distorted! Please see, in this transitional era, in this deformed and contradictory society, is it only this female clerk who is like this? Many working people are groaning, wailing, and screaming under the venomous whip of life on the one hand, and on the other hand, their minds are filled with it all day long, or even for life (it is simply what they consider the only comfort and way out, and the preaching in this film is exactly the same)··[Earn money to buy eggs, eggs hatch chicks; chicks grow up and lay eggs again, and then hatch chicks; slowly buy yellow cows; slowly and slowly buy land, buy fields, open shops, build houses, and then he will also succeed in the blessings of a [boss] and [rich man] who once dreamed of sitting and enjoying·······] In [XX Market], the so-called successful girl who tells us about perseverance and finally wins the sympathy of the current society is the typical selfish and self-interested worm! Because we want to ask··Where do people who are struggling under the [venomous whip] and have almost only a last breath left get the money to buy eggs? Even if every egg can hatch a chick, where can they get rice to feed the chick? When the chicken grows up, is it very easy to sell for a lot of money? ····Like this, isn't our [XX Market]'s heroine the same? Let's just say that she rose from [tea picker] all the way to [female secretary], and that position could give her a deposit of 200 yuan in the bank? Has she already made up her mind to let her weak and sick old mother, her infertile widowed sister-in-law, and herself all tie up their stomachs and not eat in preparation for becoming [bosses], [rich people], and [landlords] who sit and enjoy the blessings in the future? ····Has the social problem been finally and completely resolved because of her success alone? ····If not, this, this is····At least, we have to admit that this is a poisoned arrow that anesthetizes, deceives, and eases our hearts丨Also, I would like to tell the enthusiastic Mr. [Liang]  Yi Since [My Letters to Wei] was published in this column, followed by the feelings and advice of Mr. Huan Yi and Mr. Yi Hua, etc. to advise Mr. [Liang], but after a few days, I did not see Mr. [Liang]'s answer to the advice, but saw the re-posting of advertisements to recruit (in the film special edition on the 18th)··I think this is a social problem, and it is necessary to advise Mr. Liang again. All the phenomena of injustice and discontent in society are based on the shackles of the social system and the inequality of real life, and all the truth is blinded by the earth. We put aside everything else and only focus on [love], and we don't know how many fresh and beautiful flowers have been crushed by this social system! In fact, only passionate love and the struggle with this evil system can best stir people's emotions. [Love] needs to be nurtured by real life and has a very close relationship with real life; for the sake of real life, we cannot make up our minds, or even dare to express our love for the people we want to love; for the sake of real life, we have to endure the pain of leaving the people we love and who also love us; aren't there too many such disappointing facts, such painful facts? Isn't the young Werther a good example? Lotte couldn't help but be moved by Werther's unrestrained and passionate love, and also knew that there was no other girlfriend besides herself who could match Werther, but Werther's fiery passion only got a strong kiss, a painful death, and only got Lotte's tearful tears··This heartbreaking thing was also caused by real life, and the puppet-like Albert was more victorious than Werther, who was married off to others. The glamorous girls in the car, the golden threads in the Western-style houses; to describe it in the words of the inverted Eroshchenko··[Although she is cute and beautiful, she is a slave] She is a slave who sells her soul and body. Mr. Liang, blissful and sweet love can only be obtained in a rich real life. Your Wei has already gone to enjoy the material temptations. This is the truth of her soulless person. Anyone with a little scientific knowledge cannot deny it. And from Mr.'s sentence [Even if you are pregnant, I will still love you even more], it seems that you are also a person with scientific knowledge. In the published letter, you asked her··[Have you ever met such a gentle and docile heart], and her enthusiastic response to you was to leave without saying goodbye, putting you in such a painful situation, which is really too black-hearted. Even this alone is not worth your enthusiastic pursuit, but should be resented, but what tempts her to this point is entirely the evil social system丨Mr. Liang, if you are angry, if you have the courage to take revenge, the only goal should be the social system, not a woman who is floating in this social system. Your whole life is not just for a soulless woman, and there are more and more tragic events under this social system. For these, I sincerely hope that your passion will be transferred to the correct direction. Shop Assistant Correspondence Punishing Without Teaching Editor Sir··We are a few shop assistants in a large and famous industrial company in this city··In order to tightly hold on to this bitter rice bowl, we have exhausted our stubborn nature and become a group of the most cowardly people··We have some grievances in our hearts, we will only vaguely tolerate them, and dare not spit them out. But this time, the stimulation we received was too sharp, and it caused a deep sorrow in our hearts··I dare to beg for a seat in your esteemed publication, to make a weak person's [unjust cry] We are employed in the company, all employees, the positions are high and low, and the salaries are high and low, but there is no such feudal class nature among colleagues, which is very comforting. However, since the company hired an assistant manager not long ago, the positions have gradually become hierarchical··It seems that a senior employee should have the need to exercise his authority over junior employees. In order to meet the needs of the times, the company also hired five or six female employees··In today's society, larger merchants know that female employees are an important factor in developing business. And the female employees themselves, because of their fate, also regard themselves as rare goods, and our company is no exception. Although they are employees like us, their status is much more honorable, they are [guest officials] who transcend class in the company, and our assistant manager has two faces for male and female employees··He is so serious and demanding of male employees, but so kind and generous to them. Therefore, everyone in the company gave him a nickname··丨Yellow mold weather丨Among the female employees, there is a very fashionable young girl. It is said that she is also a top student in a certain middle school, and she can write some articles and publish them in tabloids. Her photo has also been published in a certain pictorial, and she has been praised as a [female writer]. She is a rare flower among all kinds of flowers, and she was soon discovered in the eyes of the assistant manager, and everyone will inevitably associate with the scene in the [rouge market] when they are flattered with smiles丨That Supervisor Lin and Miss Yan丨The thing is, a few days ago, a young trainee in the company, due to his technical immaturity and lack of experience, packed a package of goods sold by the [female writer] in a way that was not very beautiful; this female writer condemned him sternly without any scruples. The trainee did not understand the ways of the world, and argued with her a few words, she immediately put on a sullen face and walked nimbly into the assistant manager's office. After a while, the assistant manager called the trainee in. 丨[Go back to your home?] It was just such a disdainful sentence. The trainee's eyes were full of clear tears as he went to pack his bedding, and the female writer's beautiful face overflowed with a triumphant smile. Sir, would you believe this is true? But we dare not fabricate it·Our souls have been cruelly whipped, and we can only come to you to tell you about it. Please give a fair verdict! Please also give us your reply to the following questions··(1) According to the ordinary trainees of our company, they are directly under the jurisdiction of the minister together with the salesmen; above the minister, there are also directors; the assistant manager is above the director·His position is similar to that of a supervisor. Now, if a trainee makes a mistake, is it worth the assistant manager's personal review and execution? Is it appropriate for a certain lady to report directly to the assistant manager without reporting to the minister or director in order? (2) This trainee made a slight flaw in his work due to a lack of technical experience··Should he be dismissed? The words are too long, and they have cost your publication a lot of valuable space, and you a lot of valuable time, which is very sorry. Several young fellows respectfully present ×××× The editor said··The positions of employees are high and low, and the salaries are high and low, but there is absolutely no class concept among them. This kind of atmosphere·Of course, it is ideal. However, this [no class] and [equality]·Refer specifically to the personality of each individual; as for when serving, since each person is different in terms of knowledge and experience, and the positions and duties cannot but be high and low; the responsibilities cannot but be light and heavy; then the junior employees, of course, have the need to obey the guidance of the senior employees··Moreover, colleagues of the same rank should also have the obligation to supervise and encourage each other. This is entirely based on the development of the entire business, and there is no meaning of who should obey whom, or who can command whom, so it does not hinder the equality of personality between each other. The conflict between a certain lady and the trainee is probably because they both cannot understand this meaning. Therefore, a certain lady's expression and speech inevitably have the airs of a high-ranking employee, making this trainee uncomfortable; and the trainee, in turn, mistakenly believes that obeying her is to damage his personality, so not only does he not listen, but he also quarrels with her. The error in the concepts of both parties formed this unfortunate event, which is truly a so-called difference of a hair's breadth, a difference of a thousand miles. Speaking of employees and trainees, there is a minister above them; above the minister, there is a director··Above the director, there is the assistant manager··So the suggestion that employees cannot directly appeal to the assistant manager; this level is quite valuable for research. No matter how large the scale of the store is, it is not as complex as the administrative organs, so it seems impossible to absolutely prohibit appealing above the level. If you don't meet the minister and the director, and you go to the assistant manager to complain; then you can imagine that a certain lady has no one in her eyes. We want to advise the female comrades who serve in the workplace, you should achieve a state where you are not inferior to men. Being oppressed and excessively favored are equally insulting! There is one more thing that we believe that the so-called relevant minister and director in this incident should also be responsible. You shouldn't have stood by and watched, and let them quarrel to this point. When they first quarreled, you came out and reprimanded the trainee a few words, and it would have been over, how could she still quarrel like this. As for this trainee, who was dismissed because of this; our opinion is that it is too much. You should know that dismissal in a store is the same as expulsion in a school, and it cannot be easily applied. Unless he is really a scourge of the group, and there is no possibility of improvement in his life, this kind of punishment should not be used as a rule. For this kind of thing, he should be repeatedly taught and guided to repent. You can't punish him without teaching him, and dismiss him rashly.

I respectfully wish you good health, Ma Jiajun, No. 223 Ruili, Shanhai Pass Road, this city, June 22, 22nd. Novel Red and Green Lights (10)  Xi Lin (7) To what hotel was the third concubine, this bone lover, pulled by Yang Jiefu? Li Shiqiao borrowed Wu Ziqing's car with a pass to return home. The time was three or four o'clock in the morning. On this curfewed night, there was no one on the road, only the armed police standing in the dark shadows at the corners. The first wave of cold morning wind pierced his face as he came out of the heated lobby of desire. At that time, the sound of artillery fire from Zhabei clearly shattered the lingering sound of jazz music. He vaguely remembered that the outline of the plan to organize the Student Volunteer Army had not been completed. It is most uncomfortable to regret after being intoxicated. Early at seven o'clock, Zhang Honglie and Zhou Shaozeng hurried over. They didn't ask about the outline of the plan, but excitedly said··[There are already more than 200 students, but we have no experience. Independent organization is not possible, and we still have to find a way to get guns. Shiqiao, get up quickly. Let's go to the 19th Route Army together to negotiate. Don't you know that chief of staff? We plan to organize and let them dispatch it.] Shiqiao's eyes were bloodshot. It was obvious that he didn't get enough sleep last night. He casually washed up, and then went to Longhua with Zhang and Zhou to find a certain chief of staff. The chief of staff listened to their intentions with a smile. At first, he greatly praised them, but later he frowned, showing the nature of a thoughtful staff officer. He said··[This war is very fierce! Last night, our army occupied their Hongkou headquarters, and a more cruel counterattack is inevitable·····Yes, your patriotic enthusiasm is commendable·····Are you all students? If you have no experience, you must have considerable training before going to the front line·····Of course·You can organize if you want to organize, but, but you must be cautious!] [Yes·We are all students, we are all students who have had considerable military training and are willing to go to the front line to gather. Of course, students without experience will not come, so there is no need for training. Of course, we are very willing to accept the command of your army, but we must go to the front line anyway, our purpose is to go to the front line! Please consider our patriotic sincerity, please give us guns, we can start immediately!] Zhou Shaoping was so excited that he forgot all the polite greetings and due respect in the officialdom. Maybe he was right. Under the great enemy, compatriots were closer. [Don't rush to do things!] The chief of staff was not moved by Zhou Shaoping. Obviously, the reason for [don't rush] was not as simple as Zhou Shaoping thought, and the chief of staff was searching for how to deal with these fiery young people? In any case, there are too many radical elements among the students. Yesterday, someone reported that there were students in the arsenal inciting workers to seize guns, arm themselves, and automatically resist Japan, etc.? [Okay, I'll send someone to discuss this matter with you. He can also help you organize and make a thorough plan. We'll talk about it another day.]</p>

<p>Film Special Edition Women's Inspiration and Cry  Nonsense [Women] The film is a kind of inspiration for the modern world to wander on the fork in the road between the sense of annihilation and revival, a cry for humanity to fight against machinery, and liberalism to counterattack authoritarianism·It is not just a simple story of homosexual love After the demise of ancient Sparta, Prussia was the mainstay of modern strict discipline·Soviet Russia is the base camp of modern strict mechanization, and Mussolini and Hitler are the devil kings of authoritarianism Under this strict discipline, mechanization, and the rule of authoritarianism, human nature becomes a victim. Therefore, the modern world is obviously wandering between the two major trends of thought of authoritarianism and liberalism. The meaning of the film [Women] is whether individual personality can be absolutely sacrificed under the millstone of discipline, mechanization, and authoritarianism. Its conclusion is no. Human nature is active and resilient. People should have considerable training and considerable organization, but human nature, living human nature, is difficult to permanently and absolutely place under iron discipline and dead machinery. The film [Women] takes strictly disciplined Prussia as the background, and the film's actions focus on a Prussian girls' school. The stern-faced female principal represents discipline, mechanization, and authoritarianism. The spirit of running the school well is discipline, strict discipline. This point is also something that our country's too loose and undisciplined schools should emulate. However, in this iron-disciplined Prussian girls' school, that group of lively and young female students everywhere reveal their indelible human nature. See how serious they are in class, or when they see the female principal, but how naughty they are after class, or after the female principal just turns around Later·[A female student had a homosexual love affair with a female teacher, so the two major forces of discipline and human nature in the school clashed head-on. The female principal rebuked the female teacher and female student with discipline. The female teacher, who took care of human nature, replied that love has various qualities and forms, and that at her (referring to the female student) age, she should have an object of admiration. The female students who generally had human nature latent in their hearts all issued a chorus of support for the female classmate whose human nature broke out. The female student was so crazed by the excessive pressure that she almost had a tragic accident of falling from the building if it weren't for the pursuit of the general female classmates. The female principal, who only cared about strict discipline regardless of human nature, quietly left the school after realizing it. In this way, liberalism clearly won the final victory. As for the technical aspects of this film, experts have already made many good comments·I will not repeat the film review A Beautiful Woman Values Love NOMOoreorchids  Ling He After watching this Chinese translation of [A Beautiful Woman Values Love] with a very appealing name, I feel that it is necessary to first narrate the plot and then conduct criticism. A banker's daughter suddenly fell in love with a petty bourgeois, although her grandfather wanted her to marry a prince·But she was unwilling. However, in order to save her father's bank that was about to collapse, because her father had to ask her grandfather for help, she resolutely agreed to her grandfather's wishes and broke off her love. But her grandmother and father could not bear the sadness of their daughter, and decided to let the lovers become married. In the end, the father committed suicide and used his life insurance money to save the bank. Suppose·If the producers of Columbia Company could humbly use the financial panic as the real and main theme, then perhaps this work, although not necessarily completely satisfactory in terms of skill, would still have its value to some extent. For example, if a banker is willing to commit suicide in an attempt to reverse the economic collapse that is difficult to save, then even if he forces his daughter's love once, it is not a heinous crime. What's more, isn't it happy enough for a daughter to marry a prince? So it can be seen here that the author of this film is obsessed with the supremacy of love. At the same time, they are unwilling to let an ideal bank go bankrupt, and say that suicide is the only way out. This is not only to fulfill the daughter's love, but also to save the business crisis with life insurance money. So the author's painstaking efforts are really pathetic. Obviously, the authors do not take the financial panic as the theme. The most important thing is to change the super-class and super-material supremacy of love, and the real bankruptcy of the bank is just a key in the play. Of course, what they create are all unrealistic. Now, let's examine the director, performance, and other aspects. Greta Garbo in London for a moment  Fu Lun Greta Garbo had been to London before returning to the United States. She went with her friend, the Countess of Wessermester, but she dressed up as a maid of the countess. They lived in a large hotel in London, and the waiters in that hotel were also movie fans. He saw that this maid of the countess was a bit like that Swedish strange star, so he paid attention to her. Probably when staying in a large hotel abroad, you must put your shoes outside the door at night and wait for the waiter to brush them. When this waiter took the countess's maid's shoes to wipe that day, he found that the shoes were produced by a certain major Hollywood company, so he determined that the maid must be Garbo disguised. The news spread like wildfire, and the noses of the reporters were really sensitive. They gathered like hunting dogs looking for game. But when they arrived at the hotel, the Countess and her maid had already boarded a ship to France. They were empty-handed and sighed that Garbo's nose was sharper than theirs First of all, what we are dissatisfied with is the improper scheduling of the director. Judging from the story mentioned above, if it can be performed in the form of a tragic tragedy with a heavy tone, perhaps this film will therefore obtain a part of the true value. Even if we believe that there are still women in the real society who are willing to sacrifice the position of princess and condescend to an ordinary man, then this banker's daughter must be a so-called mysterious person with unique insight and extraordinary enthusiasm. At the same time, this man also has a kind of magic that grabs her heart beyond the conditions of money. But this episode does not have a scene of passionate love. It is all a description of ordinary and ordinary love, and the male seems to regard love as something external, and he is not good at exercising his body. Later, in order to save her father, she decided to bury her love, then her inner pain must make her love-crazy. But the play is not like this, and you can't see her special emotions at all. Therefore, the shortcoming of this play, in addition to the various points in the story structure, is that the director does not have a full grasp of the plot. The whole article is a happy tone, and even the father's suicide in the end fully reveals the happy life. After all, it is easiest to fail to combine a comedy form with a tragic plot. The slackness in the tone is naturally the inevitable result of the director. Of course, we don't say that all [tense] films are American successes·But if this film can be performed with a compact and heavy tone·It will definitely achieve some success. As mentioned above, then Carole LombaId's performance as the protagonist is doomed. Perhaps she is not good at tragedies, even if her happy performance in this film does not see any special flavor. The main thing is the lack of facial expressions. If this role is played by Norma Shearer, it will be very moving. Among the protagonists and supporting roles, except for the father's quite serious performance, all the others are not worth mentioning. There are no flaws in photography and setting, nor are they brilliant. The whole thing is just mediocre. Wildcat Stars in Song of the Fishermen  Scenery board This wildcat on the screen丨Wang Renmei, it's been a long time since we heard from her. The image of the wildcat's innocence and jumping and jumping has remained in our minds and cannot be erased丨She is the soul of the workers, she can make people who are extremely tired happy, she is really a good wildcat. The wildcat is from Liuyang. She is only twenty years old this year. Usually, she always laughs like a child. She does not like the extravagance of the current actresses. She does not need silk and satin and cosmetics. She only needs domestic cloth. Although she left Lianhua because the conditions were not suitable, Cai Chusheng invited her to star in [Song of the Fishermen], and I guess the result of the negotiation is that the wildcat will not disagree, right?丨The Souls of Tiantianyikang Tianyi Company Recently, the production has been too slow, so it is now actively recruiting talents. After that, at least two to three films will be produced every month. And in the future, it will no longer only make sound films, and will adopt a combination of silent and sound films. The company has repeatedly received letters from theaters in various inland ports, requesting the company to shoot silent films, because few inland theaters have sound projectors. The films currently being filmed by the company include [Forward] and [Feixu], both of which are silent, and a sound film, [Their Souls]. According to the script of [Their Souls], it was submitted from outside. Shao Zuiweng is the director, and Chen Yumei stars·Yuan Meiyun·Lu Lixia and others co-star. Chen Yumei's [Struggle]  Stars丨Li Yihe has taken it to Beijing for inspection丨Chen Yumei finished performing [Vitality] and was immediately appointed as the protagonist of [Struggle]. According to [Vitality], directed by Shao Zuiweng, it is a film with the theme of women's way out. [Struggle] was originally named [Dusk], directed by Qiu Qixiang. The film tells the story of a farmer girl and a young man's love-style struggle, fighting for the environment, fighting for life, and fighting for a way out. Finally, the January 28th Shanghai War is inserted, and the young man joins the plainclothes team and finally becomes the struggle of the masses and the country. He dies gloriously. The consciousness of the whole play is extremely strong and the structure is quite tense. This film has now been completed and will be taken to Beijing for inspection by Li Yihe, an employee of the company's distribution department. The public screening period should not be far away. Two Film News  Zhou Jingzhi (1) The Star Company's [Man Jiang Hong] can be said to be a great masterpiece after [Rouge Market]. The play has been filmed to the end, but it needs to be shot outdoors. A few days ago, director Cheng Bugao led a group of people to Suzhou to shoot outdoor scenes. The female stars who went this time included the film queen Hu Die·Yan Yuexian, Zhu Qiuhen, etc. The arrival of these beautiful stars in Suzhou can be said to be a great honor for the local people and a feast for the eyes. The group has now returned to Shanghai. (2) Cai Chusheng's [Song of the Fishermen] has been prepared for a long time, but it has been delayed until now due to the male protagonist Gao Zhanfei's relationship. It is said that Gao Zhanfei has returned to Shanghai (although the contract with the United Company has not expired, his play has been filmed). It is expected that the filming of Song of the Fishermen will begin soon. Film Novel Song of Songs TheSongotSongs (2)  Think Ping Marie Dette Reishi stars Paramount's description of the painful history of an orphan girl seeking love and encountering inhumanity Lily is alone again. She presses her face tightly against the window and looks out, but sees the lights swaying in the center of the street. [Berlin丨] She cried out softly and enviously. In the bright glass window on the side of the street, a sculpture room is faintly revealed. Stone statues wrapped in cloth are scattered and displayed. I saw a person running past the window, and disappeared in a moment. Lily picked up the Bible and got into bed. Lily softly recited the Song of Songs. Since Lily lived in her aunt's house, although she felt lonely and unhappy, and had no place to shed tears, she still forced herself to smile and help her aunt work in the bookstore. One day, she squatted on a high stool to wipe the glass window, and a young man ran from the carving room across the street. He was tall and thin, with a kind face. Lily stared at him through the window. She speculated what his name was, and whether he would run to the store. He stopped to watch a child build a snowman. He bent down again to decorate it for the child. He raised his body, just about to turn away, his eyes met Lily's glamorous eyes. He walked to the window and smiled at her through the glass that she had breathed on. When she wiped the glass clean, he was gone. The doorbell rang and the bookstore door opened. Lily turned around on the high stool and looked at who came in. It's him! She asked him what she could do for him in a dignified manner. He looked at her beautiful posture with surprise, and told her not to move. But Lily insisted on climbing down in a dignified posture and asked him if he wanted to buy a book. The young man said in one breath that it was a pity that she was wasted, and asked her how long she had been here. Lily sighed unconsciously and said that she had been here for two months. The young man said in surprise why he had never seen her, and told her that his name was Huaduo, her neighbor, and his carving room was across the street. He also asked her where the old monster in the store was. Lily smiled involuntarily and said that she had gone to the market. Only then did the young man ask her with peace of mind if she knew that she was beautiful. He said he wanted to engrave a steel statue for her, saying that she was born beautiful, and only his work could complement her, and asked her if she was interested. Lily asked him if he wanted to buy a book after all, and said that she was speaking nonsense out of thin air. He smiled and said that he didn't know her either, but he just wanted to carve a statue for her. He also said that he didn't carve for just any woman, but he wouldn't easily let go of a beautiful woman, and asked her if she could come tonight. Lily shook her head and said no, but she still smiled at him involuntarily. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Joint Meeting to Discuss the Gao Case</h3>
<p>Establishing the Gao Case Support Association</p>
<p>The Yangzhou Eight Counties Sojourners Association in Shanghai convened a joint meeting of representatives from various hometown associations yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, inside Renji Lane on Shanhai Pass Road, to discuss the handling of the aftermath of the Gao Letouzi tragic case. The details of the meeting are as follows:</p>

Over thirty people in total. The meeting commenced at 3:30 PM with the ringing of a bell.</p>
<p>Meeting Proceedings: At the start of the meeting, Song Shi was publicly elected as chairman, and Tong Lizhang as secretary. After customary formalities, the chairman reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the tragic case of Gao Yatouzi of their hometown had occurred over forty days ago, and although various organizations and groups had offered assistance in negotiations, no results had been achieved due to legal jurisdiction issues, which was deeply regrettable. He continued that while the deceased was gone, the danger to the lives of everyone else was now unimaginable. Therefore, he was honored to invite representatives to attend today, gather together, and discuss the aftermath of the Gao case, and he requested everyone's guidance. Next, physician Chen Bangping rose and reported that the court's autopsy report omitted critical aspects regarding the body, details of which were in the autopsy report. He emphasized that this case was a matter of national survival, and hoped legal experts would provide guidance on all legal strategies. Lawyers Yang Shuchun, Zhang Tianbai, and Qian Shusheng then spoke in succession, generally agreeing that the autopsy report by Dr. Chen still offered hope for legal remedies, and that the case should be pursued both legally and diplomatically. Subsequently, representatives Jiao Dingkai, Tong Lizhang, Weng Guoxun, Peng Yuncen, and others successively spoke, advocating for a simultaneous legal and diplomatic approach, along with harnessing the power of public solidarity to fight to the end. They declared that the struggle would not cease until the Gao case was resolved, to demonstrate the spirit of national self-determination and provide support for the government's diplomatic negotiations. They also proposed various countermeasures, which were summarized by the chairman and put to a vote, and passed.</p>
<p>Resolutions on Important Matters: 1. Legal Matters: In addition to the continued handling by lawyers Qian, Song, E, Zhu, and Wu, Yang Shuchun and Zhang Tianbai were added as legal research committee members to conduct lawsuits based on Dr. Chen's autopsy report. The full text of the court agreement would be retrieved and submitted to the legal research committee for discussion, and a meeting of the research committee would be scheduled. 2. Representatives would be sent to the Municipal Government and Municipal Party Headquarters to inquire about the progress of the negotiations and request a prompt response. 3. Representatives would be sent to Mr. Du Yuesheng to inquire about the progress of his mediation efforts. 4. Gao Case Support Associations would be organized in various hometown associations to expand the effort. All attendees would be representatives, working in groups to ensure a satisfactory resolution of the Gao case. 5. When necessary, a large petition would be jointly stamped by various organizations. 6. When necessary, a declaration would be issued detailing the Gao case, translated into French, and sent to domestic and foreign newspapers, as well as the French government and public. 7. When necessary, a city-wide public meeting would be convened to discuss specific strategies. 8. The organizational charter and date of regular meetings would be decided at the next general meeting. The responsible heads of each group were appointed on the spot, with the following list:</p>
<p>Appointed Heads: General Affairs Group: Song Shi, Legal Group: Qian Shusheng, Petition Group: Jiao Dingkai, Social Affairs Group: Weng Guoxun, Investigation Group: Zhou Yinting, Documentation Group: Wang Zhuru, Economic Group: Peng Yuncen, Liaison Group: Wang Jian'e, Publicity Group: Tong Lizhang and Gu Gongda.
