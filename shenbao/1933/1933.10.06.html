<h3 id="c13">領事裁判權與互惠關稅率 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 實</p>
<p>日本交政策。自内田康哉氏高倡［焦土外交］而後。。在國際方面又退出國際聯盟。一意主張以武力實行侵略。當時非特引起太平洋彼岸美國之不快。即其舊日同盟之英國。亦發生極度反感。太平洋印度洋風雲激盪大有最後解决惟恃鐵血之情勢。但日本軍閥雖横行一時。然亦自知一旦英美聯合彼在海軍方面勢必有所不敵。論經濟實力。彼固不及美國之厚。論操縱市摥之術亦不如英國之熟。設使繼續硬趕不已。則第二次大戰爆發之後。日本除踏襲德意志在歐戰當時之後塵外。别無出路。以故廣田上臺而後乃不能不高標其所謂道理外交。以圖緩和英美聯合對日之空氣。對俄亦以忽　忽硬之態度。示人以莫測。其實日本之外交方針。一如其舊。不過略變其應付環境之方法而已。</p>
<p>吾人於廣田登臺之初。即認定其必仍步武軍閥後塵。沿襲内田故智。蓋日本政府後臺主動者爲軍部軍部。之主張不變。即日本外交之方針不變。内田爲軍閥工作具。尙未盡滿軍部之意。不得已而托病去職。則今日廣田之起而繼任。當然一秉軍部之意旨。其所標榜之新方針。亦不過僅及於政治上之技術工作而止。最近宣布主張撤廢中國領事裁判權者。即彼技術工作之表現亦即日本軍閥所施放之一種烟幕而已。</p>
<p>日本國内經濟恐慌之深化。原不亞於歐美諸國。表面上就工業生産數字論。並未十分低落。販賣物價指數。且反而顯示提高。失業工人通國不過四十五萬。然吾人細察其究竟。即知其工業生産指數之所以提高。在於軍事工業之激剌。物價高漲。則爲通貨價值低落之結果。失業工人之數。僅據官方片面調查所發表並非全部。至於軍事工業之膨脹。乃爲暫時現象。其不能長久支持。自在意中。况軍事工業之爲純粹的消費事業。尤爲盡人皆知者。在戰爭期中。或戰爭之恢復時期。容或能發揮其剌激作用。然在目前世界經濟疲極之際。農業恐慌更加劇烈。日本農村以米價低落之故。農人困苦益甚於是軍事工業。乃漸失其效用。本年五月以後。工業生産指數。已向下低落此虛僞之［好景氣。］將不免於揭穿。故日政府竭其全力以圖挽救經濟上之危機。而欲挽救此危機。則不得不以商業之全力向我進展。此所以旣以撤廢領事裁判權之空名相誘。而復以互惠關稅率爲交換也。</p>
<p>吾人於中日間外交問題。誠不以深閉固拒爲然。惟造成今日之殭局。引起兩民族間糾紛者。日本實應負其全責。將來如何解决。姑置勿論即以領事裁判權一事論。固爲吾人數十年來所亟欲爭回者。今日本自願退遠。我人自無拒絶之理。惟日本在取消領事裁判權之前。先有互惠。關稅之交換條件。在目前中國之經濟情况。即能關稅自主。尙難阻遏日本之就地傾銷。設使互惠約成恐中國原料産品之輸出。仍舊不能增加。而日本製品之輸入。將如潮而至也。况日本軍隊强駐中國。沿江沿海以至於東北四省境内。或名爲保僑。或任意强佔。其有損我國主權。不知凡幾。則此區區領事裁判權之撤廢與否。又島足論哉。</p>

<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>都市中的少年和農村中的老鼠，是風馬牛一般各不相干的，怎麽好相提並論呢？那麽耶穌自有道理，且請看下面的說明··</p>
<p>比較富足一些的農民，大都不肯把收穫的米糓，當年就糶出，總是當當心心，鄭重其事的藏之倉間，以待來年；因爲在新米上市的時候，米價多少要下降的。如果不是等錢急用的話，那麽農民總是等米價高漲的時候，方才出售。［善價而沽］的貿易策略誰也會利用的。不料處此糓賤而又豐收的年頭，米價竟每况愈下，沉頭没腦的降，望漲毫無想頭，弄得農民越等越不對了。非但如此，再有耗子作對，有意來摀亂，以致多藏一天，多請耗子吃一頓。往年藏的日子少，損失不其大，今年藏的日子多，損失卻大了。農民眼見兩層損失—一是米價日日下降，一是老鼠夜夜偷吃—與日俱增，倒不如忍痛的把米糶出，變了洋錢再說。［榖賤傷農］之外，再加一樣［老鼠害農］的惡劣現象，害得農民呌苦連天。農村中的老鼠，竟做定了農村中的害物。</p>
<p>至於都市中的少年—這輩祇會千方百計浪費，而不會一絲半毫生産的麽登少爺，摩登姑娘，把祖宗流了血汗，或担了干系，或費了心計積聚錢財，絶不經意，全不心痛地任意揮霍，儘量花費。在社會上只受其害，未得其利。生活程度一天一天的高，他們的浪費一天一天的大，社會的受害一天一天的深，結果弄得不堪設想，不可收拾。那麽祖宗的錢袋和洋箱，好比農民的倉間；前者希望錢財逐漸增加，後者希望米價逐漸增高。不料同遭厄運，非但不見增加，反且逐漸减少。偷米的是萬惡的老鼠，用錢的是摩登的少年；前者是去减少倉間中的米糓，後者是去减少錢袋和洋箱中的錢財。老鼠是農村中的害物，那麽摩登少年是都市中的害物了。都市少年農村鼠，二者都是壞東西。</p>
<h3 id="c197">秋扇 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 賢賢</p>
<p>颶風，一次，二次，把摇曳着的蟬聲，吹得寂然。於是詩人們也像道士的發起［太平公醮］般的［不忘季節］，而［初秋即景］，［秋感］，［秋興］，一秋夜不寐］等絶妙好辭，便一首一首，取之無盡的從嗓子裏跳出來。不用說得，除了有瘧疾性的［内戰英雄］，大可趁此人壯馬肥的時候一顯身手外，誰都對於秋，不免有垂頭喪氣的神情。你瞧，於是素以趨炎附勢著名的蒼蠅，蚊子，臭蟲，怎一個不是藏的藏，躱的躱。在暑天最出風頭的［扇］，據說，也是不幸者之一。</p>
<p>在暑天，［扇］，眞是人們的恩物。當黄狗的舌頭拖出有二三寸長的時候，誰都［寗勿吃飯，不可無扇］。但是秋風一起，二百磅重的大胖子，身上已一點汗無存］，誰還希罕招風用的扇子。於是絹扇，紈扇，綾裱的，錦裱的扇，白辛苦了一夏，只得哭哀着臉，被主子藏進箱子去。至於那些蒲扇，油單扇之類，摇頭擺尾了一夏，早已鞠躬盡瘁的了，到這時候，便被主子丢進垃圾桶，或被作爲搧風爐之用。這便呌作［秋扇之捐］，這是最傷心的一回事。</p>
<p>社會上有很多有地位者，都是靠人捧出來的。當其尙未成功時，自然對於捧者十分要好，猶諸大伏炎天，對於扇子，是不肯須臾離手的。一旦給人捧成功了，那不啻已由近百度的天氣，一降了到五六十度的季節，見了［扇］，覺得怪累贅的，於是隨手一丢，扇就完了。［秋扇雖躺在垃圾桶裏淌眼抺淚，或是躱在煤球爐後，暴跳如雷，也是徒然。最好的例子，就是［滿洲國］的那些［開國元動］。爲虎作倀，假造民意，在在討主子的歡心，這猶如大六月裏的扇子，［清風徐來］，多麽受人歡喜。但是，留心呀，一過盛暑，天氣一天凉爽似一天，一旦日本的［吞滿計劃］成熟之後，所謂［開國元勳］，便不免被藏被丢，有成爲被捐的［秋扇］的危險哪。</p>

<p>這是長官的軍令。</p>
<p>軍士聽了命令，都奮勇衝向前去，没有一個違背命令的，爲什麽呢？因爲國家請他吃飯，養活他的命，所以應該拚命殺敵。否則無衣無食，仍舊是個死，與其餓死，不如爲國効力，他們爲的是吃飯。</p>
<p>［香水精—高跟鞋—衣料—］</p>
<p>這是情人的命令。</p>
<p>誰聽了情人的命令，没有一個敢違背的，都是唯唯從命，即使無錢購買，當了衣服也要照辦，否則老實不客氣就要愛上另一個人，他爲的是情人。</p>
<p>［一鞠躬—二鞠躬—三鞠躬—］</p>
<p>這是在結婚時司儀的口令。</p>
<p>任何人結婚，都肯服從司儀的口令，原因爲的老婆，所以寗可蠻腰曲背的鞠躬，不敢違背司儀的口令。</p>

<p>— 烟橋</p>
<p>［腰纏十萬貫，騎鶴上揚州。］在六七百年前的詩人，已經有這麽一個奢望了。逕過了清初鹽商的潤飾，自然更動人了。鄭板橋說··［千家養女先敎曲，十里栽花當種田。］雖覺得過火些，但至少有一點可以象徵之處，還有徐拙葊說··［萬姓何知奢願同，齊驅嬰武唱春風，可憐忍把無瑕玉，換得黄金富阿翁。］恐怕還是幾十年前的事，現在的揚州的［無瑕玉，］換得的黄金，未必能夠使阿翁作富翁呢。至於過江而到海上的［嬰武，］更不堪設想，伊們換得黄金，都是去富假母的。揚州！揚州！不是每况愈下麽。</p>
<p>我在若干年前揚州！到金陵，到毘陵，到鎭江，没有一次不想上揚州去一回，總是不能。直到今年的清明節，方始如願以償。從十二圩到緑楊城郭，顚簸在灰塵裏的汽車，先使我老大不快。到了瘦西湖，雖是士女如雲，可是喇嘛塔。五亭橋，小金山，徐園，一覽無遺，眞感到疲得可憐，只有城河對面的堤上，鬖鬖如髮的垂柳，柔媚比所見的揚州女兒來得藴藉。一個兼有大明湖遊船模槎的竹篙，在榖紋的水上儘劃，那船慢慢的躺過來，微風吹醒我的餘醉，聽着岸際一老丐，唱着［國民革命成功］的歌，伸着一隻布袋來乞錢。揚州！揚州！—只有他是抓住了時代的輪齒了麽？</p>
<p>［江南看去江北好，到了江北就懊恅］。罷了，罷了，總算我二十年没有間斷的日記上，有上揚州去的一頁。</p>

<p>— 之餘</p>
<p>我想讚美幾句一些過去的人，這恐怕並不是［骸骨述戀］。</p>
<p>所謂過去的人，是指光緒末年的所謂［新黨］，民國初年，就呌他們［老新黨］。甲午戰敗，他們自以爲覺悟了，於是要［維新］，便是三四十歲的中年人，也看［學算筆談］，看［化學鑑原］；還要學英文，學日文，硬着舌頭，怪聲怪氣的郎誦着，對人毫無愧色，那目的是要看［洋書］，看洋書的緣故是要給中國圖［富［强］，現在的舊書攤上，還偶有［富强叢書］出現，就如目下的［描寫字典］［基本英語］一樣，正是那時應運而生的東西。連八股出身的張之洞，他託繆荃蓀代做［書目答問］也竭力添進各種譯本去，可見這［維新］風潮之烈了。</p>
<p>然而現在是别一種現象丁。有些新青年，境遇正和［老新黨］相反，八投毒是絲毫没有染過的，出身又是學校，而又並非國學的專家，但是，學起篆字來了，塡起詞來了，勸人看［莊子］［文選］了，信封也有自刻的印板了，所詩也寫成方塊了，除掉做新詩的啫好之外，簡直就如光緒初年的雅人一樣，所不同者，缺少辮子和有時穿穿洋服而已。</p>
<p>近來有一句常談，是［舊瓶不能裝新酒］。這其實是不確的。舊瓶可以裝新酒，新瓶也可以裝舊酒，倘若不信，將一瓶五加皮和一瓶白蘭地互換起來試試看，五加皮裝在白蘭地瓶了裹，也還是五加皮。這一種簡單的試騐，不但明示着［五更調］［攢十字］的格調，也可以放進新的内容去，且又證實了新式青年的軀殼裏，大可以埋伏下［桐城謬種］或［選學妖孽］的嘍囉。</p>
<p>［老新黨］的見識雖然淺陋，但是有一個目的··圖富强。所以他們堅决，切實。學洋話雖然怪聲怪氣，但是一個目的··求富强之術。認眞所以認眞，熱心。待到排滿學說播布開來，許多人就成爲革命黨了，還是因爲要給中國圖富强，而以爲此事必自排滿始。</p>
<p>排滿久已成功，五四早經過去，篆字，詞，［莊子］，［文選］，古式信封，方塊新詩，現在是我們又有了橷的企圖，要以［古雅］立足於天地之間了。假使眞能立足，那倒是給［生存競爭］添一條新例的。</p>

<p>中國隋唐之世，亞拉伯人自立爲大食國。彼等極重希臘醫藥，以治諸疾，所用各藥，鴉片亦在内。希臘古代董家丢利哥斯低斯所著萬種藥料集成，固當言鴉片有安神止疼，使人多眼獲愈之成效也。</p>
<p>大食國於唐太宗時已來中國通商，故亞拉伯人航海至廣州等處海口，携來象牙，乳香，賓鐵，綿花，白龍腦，白沙糖，琉璃器，薔薇水等貨，並各種藥材，相與交易，瞿粟或亦在藥材中。揆歐情形，彼時之先，中國殆未當嘗有罌粟花也。一稱爲米襄花香，則以其結實如囊，其子如米，故云然也。</p>
<p>唐明皇時，陳藏器述嵩陽子言曰，罌粟有四葉，紅白色，上有淺紅暈，子具囊形，髇頭箭中有細米。又唐郭　駝種樹書云，鶯栗九月九日及中秋種之，花必大，子必滿。（見圖書集成博物彙編草木典鶯粟部彙考並花部）按柳宗元有郭彙駝傳，可證郭亦生於盛唐，與陳藏器年代殆相及。自太宗至明皇，時距百年，大食國通商中國久矣，中國已知自種罌粟，是固可有之事也。</p>
<p>宋太祖開實六年，命尙藥奉御劉翰，道士馬志等九人，參訂開寳本草，呼罌粟曰罌子粟，一名米囊子，又名御米。並言其米主治丹石發動，不下飲食，和竹瀝煮作粥食極美芙。又宋仁宗詔天下郡縣，圖上所産藥物，用唐高宗命英國公修成英公唐本草故事，專命太常博士蘇頌譔述，或圖經本草。其書中云，罌粟花處處有之，人多蒔以爲飾，種有紅白二花，微有腥氣，其實形如瓶，子有米粒極細。圃人隔年糞地，九月布子，涉冬至春，始生苗，極繁茂，不爾卽不生，生亦不茂。俟瓶焦黄，乃采之。又云，治反胃吐食，有罌粟粥，用白罌粟米三合，人參末三錢，生山芓五寸細切，研三物，以水二升三合，取六合，入生　汁，及鹽花少許，和匀分服，不計早晚，亦無妨别服湯丸。又宋徽宗政和中，醫宫通直郎宼宗奭譔本草衍義，略云罌粟子性寒，多食利二便。研此水煮，加蜜作湯，飲之甚宜。他如楊士灜直指方，王璆之百一選方，王碩易簡方，均云罌粟壳治痢有特效。根據以上諸說，可證宋人已以罌粟子或其外壳煮湯製丸治疾，且以爲治痢之珍	品也。至宋詩有詠及罌粟者，於乎前舉蘇軾蘇轍之詩外，尙有謝遇詠罌粟花七絶一首，詩云··</p>
<p>鉛膏細細點花梢，</p>
<p>道是春深雪未消。</p>
<p>一斛千囊蒼玉粟，</p>
<p>東風吹作米長腰。</p>
<p>金劉河開宣明方，治欬嗽多年自汗者，用罌粟殼二兩半，去蒂膜，醋炒，取一兩，烏梅半兩，焙爲末，每服二錢，臥時白湯下。又李杲云，罌粟榖收斂固氣，能入腎，故治骨病尤宜。又危亦林得效方，治久泄不止，粟殼去筋，蜜炙爲末，每服五分，蜜湯下，卽效。又朱震亨曰，今人虛勞欬嗽，多用粟殼，止刼；及濕熱泄痢者用之，止澀。其治病之功雖急，殺人如劍，宜深戒之。根據以上諸說，可知金元時代。罌粟殼不僅用以治痢。且有用以治欬嗽，治骨病者。至朱震亨謂其殺人如劍，宜深戒之，可見彼時已有因鴉片中毒而死之人也。至其見於文學者，馮子振十八賦云，或簪烘霽之罌粟，或霬凝霜之菊英，則　粟花尙有觀賞之用也。</p>

<p>你煩悶嗎？</p>
<p>［煩悶又怎樣？］你也許會反問。</p>
<p>只要你肯反問，我就有話好說，因爲我是知道煩悶了該怎樣的，我有一個解除煩悶的方案。</p>
<p>比如你萬分地覺得疲倦而無聊，不曉得要做些什麽事才好，只是悶悶的，那你可出門，門外是不會没有不煩悶的榜樣的。</p>
<p>在剛出門的時候，你的脚步，不用說，是沉重的，你得用力地拖。可是拖丁不久，你會忽然聽到一個聲音，一個很幽閒的聲音，在從不知什麽地方輕妙地飄來，於是你抬頭探望，一看前面有一個賣胡琴的在走來。你看到他手在拉着，肩上還背着許多大大小小的胡琴。雖然在那樣的鬧市中，他却旣不看東西，又不看人地只是拉着清亮流利的調了，是一副滿不在乎的樣子。</p>
<p>［要是我也有這樣的一只胡琴，］你會突然頴悟地想，［我自然也可滿不在乎了。］</p>
<p>旣然如此，你爲什麽不該也有那樣的一只胡琴呢？你是没有不該也有一只的理由的，於是你也有了一只。</p>
<p>於是，從此你也拉你的胡琴，你的煩悶也就此被驅除了。你也可旣不看東西，又不看人地只是拉着，滿不在乎地。　［學一個賣胡琴的樣子，］你最後肯定，［决不是一件什麽難事；爲什麽放着這樣容易學的不學，而還儘去煩悶？］</p>
<p>因爲你自已是已感悟了的，你會想不出人家爲什麽還要煩悶的所以來。也許是因爲人家没有你看得穿，在斤斤於衣食的得失。看得穿的，除你自已之外，只有那個賣胡琴的，你相信。你相信他也是萬分地覺得［疲倦］而［無聊］，才在街上幽閒地，［滿不在乎］地拉着胡琴的　還有，能驅除煩悶的，不只胡琴，還有書本，愛人，天上的雲霞，路邊的閒花。今天你對於甲失了信仰，明天你可信仰乙··只要你善轉，你是總會有一個使你不再煩悶的對象的。</p>

<p>兩個團丁押着春生的屍首，遠遠地抬進屋子襄來，少雲嬸的心肝像給人家挖去了。她猛的一聲，口襄噴出一灘鮮血。</p>
<p>［我的苦命的兒呀！······］</p>
<p>她祇呌了這麽一句，便抱着那血綢的屍身打滾。死者的頭頗老遠的抛在旁邊。</p>
<p>半响她還没有聲息。團着看的親鄰大半都偷偷的彈着淚珠兒。没有一個人言語，眼瞧着少雲嬸婚仆在那死屍的身邊。</p>
<p>［怎麽？］族長從人叢中跑出來，很命的在少雲嬸的身上踢了一脚··［你還不起來嗎，誰敎你自家養出這樣不肖的兒子？］</p>
<p>少雲嬸呆着眼珠子不能作聲。</p>
<p>［拿水來！］族肯吩咐着。</p>
<p>輕輕的一噴，少雲嬸又哭起來了··</p>
<p>［我的兒呀！······］</p>
<p>［不要哭！］族長威嚇着··［這兒還有兩位副爺在等候着你的回音呀！］</p>
<p>少雲嬸當眞不敢哭出聲來了。她凝望着族長　［副爺說，］族長特别的提高了聲音··［總局裏的規定··每斬决一名本地的犯人，要二十元的刀手費······］</p>
<p>［刀手費？］少雲嬸的眼前又是一音。她現在連春生的棺材錢都還没有。</p>
<p>［還有，］族肯接着告訴她··［春生監禁了二十三天，每天的伙食三角，九元九。連刀手費一共三十元錢。得一齊交出來給副爺們帶去！一</p>
<p>少雲嬸更加說不出話來了。她爬起來對族長叩三個響頭··</p>
<p>［長三公公呀！我那裏來的錢呢？現在春生的棺木還······］</p>
<p>［誰敎你養出這種不肖的兒子？］</p>
<p>少雲嬸的心窩像要炸開。她想咬還個族長一口，可是······</p>
<p>［没有嗎？］兩個團丁也站將起來！［那麽你就先交一個親人給你們帶去吧！等你們的錢到了再放他回來。······］</p>
<p>［長三公公呀！］</p>
<p>族長的臘袋連忙摇了幾下··</p>
<p>［我也没有法子啊！］</p>
<p>於是小的一個兒子泰生，又被團丁從人業中拖出來了。</p>
<p>［走！］團丁們在泰生的不肯走的腿子上搥了一下；回頭來對着少雲嬸··［請你趕快送錢來，不然一天又是三角！······］</p>
<p>少雲嬸完全發瘋了··她喊族長，她呌天，她抱着大兒子春生的屍身打滾。</p>
<p>親鄰都流着悲傷的眼淚。</p>
<p>夜晚，親鄰又都來替她將大兒子收殮了。爲了小兒子，爲了三十元錢刀手費和伙食費，少雲嬸越痛越瘋。</p>
<p>天哪！</p>
<p>終於··她在三更時分上吊了！</p>
<p>二十二年九月，姨母逝世的第三週年。</p>

<p>— ＨenrideＲeguier著李萬居譯</p>
<p>在四點鐘喝茶的時候，每天我都在旅館的大廳裏看見都爾蘭質夫婦，老是坐在離門不遠的那兩個老位子上，這張門好像使都爾蘭質先生很感興味似的。到將近六點鐘的時光，門開了；門房拿着郵件進來，把一束報紙放在都爾蘭質先生面前，而他便連忙攫在手裏。他是怎樣疾忙地撕掉封條並展開那篇幅闊大的印刷物啊！···當他很快的看着報的時候，他的女人便留心地凝視着他。有時候都爾蘭質先生遞過一張報紙給她，並用指頭指出幾行新聞給她看。這對夫婦使我驚異，當我每次看見這情形的時候。這位對於時事關心到這樣程度的都爾蘭質先生到底是誰呢？難道世界上眞有一些人除去對於失掉了的幸福的想念之外，一切都不是與他無開的嗎！</p>
<p>然而，在里華的勾留漸漸使我壓煩了，我决定再繼續我的旅行。在出發的前一天，我租了一隻小船，在湖中過了一部份時間。我覺得櫂聲似乎緩和了我的苦痛和懊惱。我直到喝茶的時候才回旅館，當我踏進大客廳的當兒，那門工正把一束報紙交給都爾蘭質先生。他才展開一張，祇看了幾個字，我便看見他的顔色突然變成蒼白。他的兩手顫動着。一種激烈的情緒把他完全擾亂。驟然間，他站起身出去了。都爾蘭質夫人跟在他後面。報紙留在桌子上面。我走近去。這是一份［政治新聞］。第一頁上面用大號字的標題，記載着議會裏一塲紛擾的開會的情形。外交總長演了一塲說，結果是使得内閣倒了。一些對外的難題釀成了這閣潮，也卽是一個影響到全國的政潮。</p>
<p>都爾蘭質夫婦都没有出來吃晚飯。把飯吃完了，便去湖濱吸一支紙烟。夜間的天氣是温煖而柔和的，我在那兒聽了好久蕩漾的波聲，並瞧着一輪黄色的滿月徐徐從地平線上昇起。我的紙烟吸完了，便向旅館走回。大客廳廳裏有兩個當天早晨才到的英國人，在喝着［威士忌］酒。我没有驚醒那正在打盹的門了，扒上了寛闊的樓梯，沿着那條從都爾蘭質夫婦的住室前面經過，直通到我的臥房的過道走去。當我走近他們的住室時，便隱約廳見一些激越的不常聽見的語聲。我停了脚，側耳細聽。這是都爾蘭質先生的聲音，但他的聲音變了，變得粗大了。靜寂的空間充滿了這聲音的回響。這是一種演說家的，雄辯家的，雄壯，老練，爲着激動羣衆而發的聲調。我可以向你斷言··在這荒凉而無人的客棧裏，這樣從這關着的門外聽見這種聲音，確是奇怪的事情。</p>

<h3 id="c274">文憑與麫包 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 光漢</p>
<p>文憑會和麫包發生關係，並不是偶然的事。</p>
<p>一個人由家庭踏進學校，之乎者也的呢？ABCD呢？三加六等於九呢？茫茫然，混了幾多歲月；家裏的父兄，花了幾白或幾千塊錢，了却一重培植子弟的心願；學校中由校長敎職員以至於茶房，個個領到薪水，亦卸下幾分敎育學子的責任；而我們自已，得到一紙寤寐求之的文憑，也算盡了辛苦讀書的義務。大家功德圓滿，萬事大吉！</p>
<p>當一個人挾着一紙文憑，由學校滾入社會中去，第一件要事，就是謀生活。謀生活就是搶麫包的别名。於是乎文憑便和麫包發生起瓜葛來。某烟紙店要僱用學徒，程度須小學畢業；某公司欲招考書記，學識須中學畢業；某書局擬聘請編輯，資格須大學畢業。所謂程度，學識，資格，代表物當然就是文憑。</p>
<p>因爲吃麫包要有文憑，由是社會上騙文憑，買收文憑，僞造文憑，販賣文憑的事，就應運而生。蓋所以供給社會的需求也。</p>
<p>但是有文憑不一定就有麫包吃。在這種情形之下，文憑不免成爲一張不兌現的廢紙。藏之無用，棄之可惜，又好像鷄肋。查有文憑而吃不到麫包的原因有種種··社會上供過於求，不善鑽營，牽引乏人，無背景，有眞文憑而没有眞本領等等。</p>
<p>的確的。文憑會和麫包發生關係，並不是偶然的事。</p>
<h3 id="c275">解决吃飯問題的一幕滑稽劇 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 笠笠</p>
<p>吃飯問題，凡是要吃飯和會吃飯的人，都是個最切身的急要解决的問題。憑學校生活的我們，雖可不必自已找飯吃而有飯吃——因爲未入成人之途·經濟不能獨立，大可以張開嘴吃父母的血汗，像雛燕待哺般的。我們還小啦！？　　在通學生的我們，午飯是件可成問題的問題，雖是母親早煑熟了飯，笑迷迷的等候着我們回去狼吞虎嚼的大吃。但，路途迢遠，往返太不便啦！在校午膳吧？實在吃不慣那没味的飯和菜，於是乎，吃飯遂成問題矣！</p>
<p>最初幾天帶些麵包餅干等才點心充充飢腸，可是甜膩膩乾卜卜的實在難以下咽，只有拚命的喝水，硬把麵包餅干如黄河决口似的冲進咽喉。</p>
<p>經一位舊同學的指引，呌校役買了餛飩麵等類濕點心在敎室中大嚼——因女孩兒臉嫩，在膳堂内給敎師看見了很不好意思——一起提倡，羣相步趨，於是敎室一變膳堂··［湯匙與碗筷齊鴻，啜湯與吸麵相應。］</p>
<p>人數一多難免緩遲，時常有上課鐘已敲，尙有据案大嚼的，聞鐘鳴面心驚，遂致手足無措，潑湯落筷的閙得一團糟。牛性一拗就走上門去了，在僻陋的斜橋，有精雅小座供你細酬緩酌？只有那二葷舖式的小麵館，帶買餛飩　子，没有飯的——這是勞動階級解决吃飯的所在，價廉物多——味不美——十二個銅元的一碗老麵，十個銅元的一碗錕飩，三個銅元的一個肉饀　子，化不了二毛錢，吃了三個花樣，肚子可以裝得滿滿的回去。</p>
<p>老實講，這又髒又窄的小麵館，平日正眼兒也瞧一下，不要說去吃東西了可是在不得意，没辦法，不能解决吃飯問題，而又禁不起肉鬨——肚飢——的我們，終於踏進了這又矮又窄又不清潔的小麵館，仗着人多蓋了臉，到也不覺得難堪，就你要餛鈍我要麵他要湯　，百鳥和鳴的嚷了一陣。坐下了又狹又　的長凳，拈起了又粗又糙的毛竹筷，捧起了藍花粗瓷的碗，呼啦呼啦的吃起來，到也别有風味。冷落骯髒的小麵館，給一羣天眞活潑的小天使一點綴，是這樣的活耀燦爛有生氣，惹得行人注目了。</p>
<p>這是午飯的時候，在小麵館解决吃飯問題的勞動階級，按着老例拖着疲乏的笨重的身軀，踱進了小麵館。任慣了有破綻的藍布衫褲的方桌長凳，竟換上了白衫黑裙，這在他們是奇跡，失神的驚疑的目光，掃了我們的一遍，就在近門的桌子上坐下來，要了一碗加三的麵——加三者加鹹菜也——風捲殘雲一會兒就完了，這小小的一碗麵，恐不能塡滿那給勞動壓榨得乾　的肚子。　氣的我，呆呆的望着他們，讓餛飩上面上騰的白氣，慢慢的低下去。</p>
<p>嬌貴（？）的小姐，和粗野（？）的勞動階級在一起吃飯。在階級觀念没有打破的現社會，是怪異的現象？</p>

<p>記不起是某年的一個緑了芭蕉的秋爽時候。</p>

<p>夜半了！冷僻的街上，靜寂的絶少聽得細碎的脚聲。</p>
<p>［阿順，早些睡吧，明天三娘舅一清早就要來和你到ＸＸ商店去啊！］老年人的破竹似的聲音，</p>
<p>睡，年輕的阿順，他想··好像眼前並不需要的一回事！雖然他的眼皮有些感到被厭着沉重的東西一般，但他終不願意他的娘在這夜色蒼茫中，獨自做一活計。］</p>
<p>［睡啊！啊順，］老年人不耐煩的摧促了，終放使他縐緊了眉梢的離開他的娘的懷抱，在床上，閉住了眼，翻來覆去的睡不着，</p>
<p>煩惱的情懷，傷感的遭際，在他的複雜的憶念中，使他勾引起悽切的憂思！他想··幾年來的無意識的漂泊，流浪！一切像被染上了深灰的色彩！淚，這曾似相識的淚，在枕畔，在阿順的眼裏，忍不住的流淌了！一棵棵好像帶着慘笑的混的晶瑩的珍珠！</p>
<p>第二天的早晨，三娘舅已來他的家了，</p>
<p>［三娘舅，早啊，請坐坐，］睡眼朦膜的老年人在拭抺着凳上的微塵，從檯上倒了杯剛由老虎灶泡來的滾熱的茶給三娘舅，她的眼角上含掛了一些微微的笑，然而老年人的深刻了縐紋的蒼白的臉上，更顯着［龍鍾］了！她的削去了肉的面頰，突出的可怕的罐骨，乾　得有些程度的兩耳，像這樣的一個線條錯縱的輪廓，明透的，是象徵着患失眼症的暗示。</p>
<p>［好啦，阿順娘，］三娘舅伸了個長時間的懶腰，</p>
<p>老人年懇切的凝視着移動，在她面前的阿順的瘦弱的身子。</p>
<p>［阿順，你到那裏該聽人家的話啊！］她說··</p>
<p>［你的脾氣也該和柔些啊！］</p>
<p>［你的············</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>［媽，我都明白的，你放心好了！］阿順的幼稚的心懷，情感地簡直說不出話，</p>
<p>離家，在行人道上踏着輕爽的脚步。</p>
<p>大都會的晨曦，在長鼻子烟囱的怒吼聲中，從黑暗的墳墓裏爬出來，吐着光明的火燄，</p>
<p>携帶的一張破蓆，一個包袱，一條用麻繩綑緊的舊棉絮被，這些東西，在阿順的復活的生命上，開始結識了［新的良伴。</p>
<p>ＸＸ商店是Ｘ埠一個熱鬧街市上的最有名望的大百貨店</p>
<p>在那裏，從早晨［開牌門］起到晚上［打烊，］十五個鐘點的度着［小夥計］的刻板生活，一些没有空閒的機會給你高談闊論，雖則ＸＸ商店有些時候，營業比較清淡些，然而聰明的精幹的老問，他會呌你做些例外的工作，好像抱他的那位一歲半的千金小組咧，　柴爿咧，或者帮　　　　　　　　　　　等等。這樣辛考的　　　　　　　三個半月了！</p>
<p>可　，一個　　生活的輪齒中被剥榨着出賣軀榖的骨髓的迷戀者！</p>
<p>天底下的［順逆］的原理，有時候也矛盾得發笑，我們這位年輕的阿順，在他克勤克儉的工作下，從夢裏都料想不到，他是失業了！</p>
<p>據說失業是因爲貪懶的緣故，但阿順對於這失業的不幸，好像非常憤懣，懶，他是最憎惡的，他明瞭他的失業是根據於下　人情世故的原因，他不會奉承，不會拍馬，偏偏他的老關最愛奉承，最愛拍馬，丨阿順是失敗了！</p>
<p>當他羞澀的低了頭，携帶了一張破蓆，一個包袱，一條用麻繩綑緊了的舊棉絮被，但覺他的周遭，有許多冷酷的譏笑，猙獰的白眼，使他恐慌的趕緊滾出ＸＸ商店！</p>

<p>— 蘋</p>
<p>在一位女作家的創作小說中，她說過兩句話，現代女子的人生哲學，是［憑相青春，抓住享樂一，來做　們的目標的。</p>
<p>的確，她底這兩句短短的格言，誰也相信，她是用了攝影機一般的目光，把現代一部份女子底内心的動向，絲毫不爽的攝到她的筆底，然後又把他表現到紙面上。但是，我們若果細心的把這兩句話體會一下，許多歷史上的事蹟，已經證明了［憑藉青春，抓住享藥］的人生哲學，不惟是　代一部份女子處世的寳筏，同時也是古代一部份女子做人的圭泉。</p>
<p>談到早藥，據我個人所知道的，不外有兩種思想··一種是精神上的享受，一種是物質上的享受。藝術的欣賞，自然的感應，愛情的陶醉，是屬於前者的。肉慾的追求，烟酒的剌激，金錢的刦掠，是屬於後者的。</p>
<p>這類粗淺的道理，我們若果單從字面上去研究，旁髴精神的享受較物質的享受要求得高明··然面事實上却極端的大謬不然。全世界的芸芸衆生，　論男的，女的，老年的，小孩的，誰　不是在睁大下眼晴，握緊了拳頭，跟在物質的屁股後面，拚命的去追逐她。</p>
<p>一部份的哲學家，認定物質　　　是宇宙中的兩種互相因果的現象。要求精神的愉快，第］一步還須要求到物質的滿足；否則，勿論你是高據在象牙塔上，或是倚猥在愛人的懷中，只要三天不給你飯吃，你依然一樣底會餓死的。</p>
<p>古老的喧們中華民國，男子在社會上的地位，不論在任何場方，都比一般女子來得重要。在敎育不普及和女子職業尚未發達的現在，經濟大權幾乎完全是操在男子手中。男子可以利用他優裕的經濟地位，去誘惑女子，欺騙女子，使女子毫無抵抗的屈伏在他的黄金下面。</p>
<p>這種畸形的發展，一方面固然是要怪男子無理性，而另一方面也就是女子太遇相信［憑藉青春，抓住享樂］底人生哲學，而生出來的一　壞環象。</p>
<p>據普通的說法，一個女子的青春時期，充其景不過從十六歲到廿六歲，在這短短的十年當中，女子雖然可以驕傲好用她青春的麽力，來使男子們傾到，懲慕，而達到她享樂的目的；但是到了十年之後，美麗的青春，已漸漸地隨年華而消失，一轉眼就　她戀做一個雞皮鶴髮的老嫗。那時色　　弛，男子們　她的心理，她能把握制住，還是一個同題。</p>
<p>因此我認爲憑藉青春，而抓來的享樂是絶對底不可靠的。未了，我敢以誠懇的態度，奉勸一般沉醉在這種錯誤觀念中的女子，希望你們切不要自已看不起自已，因爲圖一時的享樂而貽誤了你們的終身。你們推一的出路，只有靠自已的努力，把一切的一切都趕到男子的前面去。</p>

<p>世界上的［眞］唯有孩子們是眞，所以大人們的事情，他完全不曉得，這一响，他在兩眼常常注視着母親和不相識的父親談笑的時候，他充滿着天大的氣問。</p>
<p>［媽，爸爸怎麽幾個星期不回來呵？媽，那天爸爸爲什麽大電音的鬧？媽，連我的糖也長遠没有吃了。媽，你替我去買。］他目的要吃糖，說了幾句呆話。</p>

<p>［媽，那個天天夜裏來的男人，爲什麽要我呌他爸呢？我的爸爸是買糖我吃的，是戴眼鏡的，穿外國人一樣的衣裳的。眼遠隔壁菱兒來，呌我爸爸也呌爸，你同爸爸不是笑她怎麽有兩個爸爸呢？媽，我怎樣有兩個爸爸呢？］</p>
<p>［孩子，你不要多嘴，你小啦，不知的。］她羞答答的好像芒剌在背。</p>
<p>他的疑問，依然是不了解的疑問，他又想起以前同爸媽一起睡在那張大銅床上，現在爲什麽呌我獨自睡在沙發椅呢？他又發話了；</p>
<p>［媽，你怎麽同那個男人］横頭睡呵？不是從前爸爸說的，鄉下表哥娶了嫂嫂，嫂嫂同别的男人睡在床上，被表哥看見了，不是駡了頓，打了一塲吧！爸爸說後來離婚的。媽，怎麽呌做離婚？］</p>
<p>［媽，爸爸學校放假回來的吧？］他又疑問的論根到果的問。</p>
<p>她在這時候，心靈上，同丈夫怎麽的淘氣，怎麽的到律師前離婚，怎麽的兒子呌我養，一切的一切，像電影映入眼簾，又加了她可憐的兒子的一句句疑問地呆話，酸溜溜那裏話得出來！祇有··</p>

<p>失業是人生歷程中的常事，也是職業界中應有的遭遇，無是稱奇，也無周愁悶，人遇失業雖然是一件不幸事情，如能利用失業時期，　　自身如以修養，加以反省，極易尋得已往的錯誤，能急流勇進的加以自修，極易獲得顯著的進步，將來一遇得業機會，就能得着更好的待遇和快樂，所謂吃得苦中苦方爲人上人，鄙人是遭遇失業的過來人失業時期的艱難困苦，當然不能例外，現在所以能重獲枝棲者，一由於友朋的帮忙介紹，一由於自已利用失業時期修養之功，失業的朋友們，你們感覺失業的痛苦難受嗎？你們要想將來獲得較前更好的職業嗎？要是對的，那末請你們注意下列數點。</p>
<p>一，在失業的時期，切不可因失業而灰心進取，也不可因閒居而作不良消遺。</p>
<p>二，常常加以反省以往的不是，加以糾正，痛改前非。</p>
<p>三，常看有益於自已所希望之書籍，以補學力之不足。</p>
<p>四，忍受失業時期的痛苦，養成降心靜氣的良好習慣，</p>
<p>失業並非絶對的不幸，吾人如能利用失業時期加以修養，實爲失業人之目新機會，深望受失業打擊的同胞們，味吾言而實踐之，則失之東隅，收之桑榆，可拭目而俟矣。</p>

<p>第三幕　和平禮讚</p>
<p>金融巨頭··是的，每次軍政當局在華北籌欵的時候，兄弟總很盡職。我這個人很梗直，做得到就說做得到，盡力做去，直到我說做不到的時候，那未這事情一定没有辦法。所以前天部長跟我談到這問題的時候，我就說没有辦法，到現在也還是没有辦法。</p>
<p>機要秘書··可不是，從前張少帥在這兒的時候，張先生的爲華北財政的努力，那眞是令人欽佩。現在假使張先生還是那樣肯爲政府出力，我想是别說二千萬，就是再多些，五千萬，一萬萬，在張先生也不費吹灰之力。</p>
<p>議和代表··哈哈，是極是極！張先生在財政上的手腕，那眞是全　皆知，令人欽佩之至！</p>
<p>金融巨頭··承部長和諸位誇奬，漸愧得很。這一次發行的二千萬戰債戰債，眞是没有辦法。這並不是我們懷疑政府的信用問題，而是天津的銀行界都拿不出錢來，無人承銷，這是事實問題，並不是兄弟不肯帮忙。</p>
<p>軍事當局··喂，我想這一定要弄清楚，這决不是替政府帮忙的問題，而是替你們自已做事。爲什麽呢？政府對於抗日，早具决心，雖至一兵一卒，仍得長期抵抗。難道張先生忘記了嗎？這次要求停戰，是你們銀行界首先提出的呀，並不是政府先有停戰的决心。假如現在却一味說是替政府帮忙，那未我們　以不必　　停戰；繼續　　　　　看那一方面損失最大？何况保守國土，爲國損軀，本是我們軍人的天職，難道我們還怕抗日嗎？眞是笑話！</p>
<p>企業家··不過據我所知道，軍事上的失利，也是急忙停戰的主要原因之一。正如剛在部長說，我們不必受無謂的犧牲。</p>
<p>機要秘書··這樣說，劉先生的意思，以爲是我們軍人首先要先要求停戰了？那太笑話了。劉先生素來眼光遠大，難道這樣繼續打下去，影響到市面如此蕭條，劉先生的棉紗還能夠像以前一樣的生　興隆嗎？這是很明顯的事實了。</p>
<p>企業家··旣然賀秘書這樣說，那末我也很有理由來回答他的。不錯，市面蕭條，影響到中國工業的發展，但是在另一方面說，站在我們工業立塲上說，我們狠可以忍受目前戰時的犧牲。因爲我們希望擴大這民族戰爭，甚而至於收復東北失地，奪回我們原有的市塲。同時，戰爭繼續下去，抵貨運動自然也得繼續，那末這對於我們工業當然是極好的時機。但是，事實上並不能如我們所願，老實說，中國軍人還不能蟾當保障和發展民族資本的重任；雖然衛國守土是中國軍人的天職。這是鐵一般的事實，不是强辯可以掩飾的。至於擴充海外市場到外國去，都更是我們的夢想。正因爲如此，所以不如　時　　一不　　　　苟延殘喘的再呼吸一口氣。我們同　　　　　　　說不出　苦。</p>

<h3 id="c283">（四）［生機］導演邵醉翁（上） <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>一提起這位先生，我想諸位讀者一定很感興趣的。［爲付麽呢？］假使你們這樣問··那末我就要說··［你看過［生機］没有？］的確，［生機］這一部作品，眞是不至於敎我們忘記的。</p>
<p>正因爲如此，於是當我去拜訪他的時候，也就下意識的來注意他了。不知你們見過他没有，我想你們很容易在他臉上發現一個特點··當他滿臉堆着笑容的時候，你瞧！那左眼大，右眼小。說句笑話，假使邵先生也肯［犧牲色相］來主演一部影片的話，只要那雙眼睛，我想他是非常適宜來做一個反派角色的。</p>
<p>爲了讀者的光陰和申報篇幅的寳貴，以下便記録他的談話了。在周圍掛滿了影片呆畫的會客室中，他坐在我面前笑笑的，操着寗波口音的官話說··</p>
<p>［就目前中國電影的作風來說，一般的都是暴露現社會的黑暗，一點也不求解决。換句話說就是專事破壞而不圖建設。殊不知現在的中國已不堪再破壞了。所以，我個人覺得，中國電影應當是改應當是改良，建設，同時也不談戀愛。這自［生機］而後，有着具體的表現。</p>
<p>［又如我現在開始攝製的［吉地］，那裏面是說一個農民有一塊風雨很好的吉地，某富人欲以重價購去。農民爲了地下葬的是先人骨肉，自然不忍遷移。然而在他並非迷信，他却要富人出資開一小河，導湖水入村以救旱災爲交換條件。這就是說打破迷信，爲大家謀利益。現在農村旣然如此破産，應當力謀建設。這便是我的主義··不破壞而改良。］</p>
<p>在這簡單的言詞中，我們不難看出邵先生整個的思想。的確，中國社會已經是如此腐爛不堪，還不應當建設嗎？這是千眞萬確的。但是在理論上說，應當先有舊的破壞而後有新的建設。好像翻造房屋似的根本改造。假使就原有的修補［改良］，那末這基礎動摇的房屋終於不能安如磐石的吧。所謂［不破壞而改良］，到底不免枉費了仁人君子的一片婆心。然而在他的地位，是應當這樣說的，我們可在以下的言詞中得着證明。</p>
<p>［天一公司完全是我個人獨資創辦的。］他說··［十年前資本爲一萬元，及後漸增至十萬元，再加上七八萬元的流動金。現在連各項生財在内全部估價，約爲五十萬元。事實上是賺錢的。天一公司有一特點，便是不欠債，即如一切材料，都以現欵購買，這是其他影片公司没有的現象。］（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c284">評［死光］ＣhandutheＭagician <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 南京映—里人</p>
<p>近代科學的發達，是逐漸消滅宗敎及其他迷價神怪的唯心觀念的。因此一切根據科學精神而出現的一切文學藝術，那構成牠們的意德沃羅基和情節，總應該不容情地排除那些非科學精神的各種因素。</p>
<p>科學的發明，牠的眞實目的是帮助人類進一步克服自然界，就是說，給人類造福利。但是少數的世界統治者們却利用了牠—科學的發明—去製造戰爭，去屠殺無辜的人羣。在目前各帝國主義國家的競造軍艦，飛機，以及化學工業，這就是很明顯的利用科學去殺人的例子。因此，在各帝國主義戰爭競備底下，科學家也跟着來發明一切殺人的利器，從坦克到毒瓦斯，不斷的發明着，據說死光也已經有了發明。</p>
<p>福斯公司採取這樣的發明事件，來攝製影片。照理，這應該是一部貫注着近代科學精神的出品，可是事實上竟大謬不然。然事中的死光發明者，在開始出現的時候是給我們一個電機工程師的像貌，那圍繞在他身旁的完全是機械化的模型。但在另一培地却有許多［鬼迷張天師］的地方。我們看見有魔術師在那兒供繩子昇天，入火不燒等道法，和章多的架風回家，這兩種不同的精神，竟可以把牠們配合起來，這不能不要佩服好萊塢的製片老板們的手腕大；但如果有［封神榜］，［西游記］，［七劍八俠］的咱們貴國製片老板來看了，一定要說［好萊塢也學起中國來了。］</p>
<p>故事是没有什麽特别的結構，只是運用許多危險驚人的盡面來攝取觀衆的注意力，如開始時章多的回家，密赴羅克索的堡去探聽消息，許多機關的恐怖，羅克索的恐嚇羅柏，······</p>
<p>等，而這些又全是極其怪誕的，假如一部影片是用這樣的方法來吸引人的話，那未免空虛得太可憐了。是的，資本主義文化，本來就是極其空虛的。他們的作者可以虛構一個故事，造作許多令人驚心動魄的培遇，而解决這一切危難的是荒渺不可稽的魔術，符咒。因此在［死光］這片襄，章多可以在打進鐵箱，沉人尼羅河底，以後還浮上水面來，終於制服了羅克索，因爲他是有法術的；但是有人如果這樣說。［章多旣是確實有制服羅克索的法術，爲什麽不早就把他消除呢？］這問題的答案在我們聰明的說明書編撰者會說是一還没有惡貫滿盈］，總明的編劇者會說，［要這樣會没有戲做了］。</p>
<p>演員的表情，都没有什麽特出的地方，演女兒的ＪuneＶlaiek恐怖的表情還不夠。劇中穿插的滑稽角色比較的好些。兒子這脚色在這劇中没有什麽必要。</p>
<p>總結起來說，這部影片是極其荒誕神怪無稽的出品，在現在這科學世紀牠是反科學的，而目牠有意無意的宣傳着魔術，魔術在牠是解决一切困難的方法，藉這影片更可以使帶有封建觀念的半殖民地民衆，加深他們對於神道的觀念，使他們不要進步，不要科學，更愚蠢，更麻痺，好役使，好處分。</p>
<h3 id="c285">評蠻牛渡戇王Tra　Diavolo <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>勞萊哈台能夠號召觀衆，乃是不成問題的。因此，他們便成爲製片家的摇錢樹了。現在爲了供給生活過於疲倦的人們的急迫的需要，也就得加緊生産，於是乎他們的笑片，幾乎是充塞了電影市塲。</p>
<p>關於他們的作品，我們每次都有同樣的感覺·淺薄的，輕鬆的，决不能找出少許比較嚴重的意義。如以卓别麟或是雪尼霍特相比，更見這種評斷之正確。這是因爲他們修養功淺之故，同時生活决定了他們的意志，而且市塲上所需要的是這些，不，生活得過於疲倦的人們所要求於他們的，就是這些淺薄的歡笑，所以他們也只得如此這般。</p>
<p>如此說來，他們的作品是禁不了嚴格檢討的，特别是當他們同時主演影片的時候。反之，如以他們純焠爲了製造笑料而使用，未始不足以增加作品的笑料，因爲他們祇能製作一些淺薄而無骨子的噱頭。因此，在這一作品中，他們祇站在配角的地位，担當着小丑的任務，倒是非常適宜的。然而仍不免有胡鬧的地方，如因一條牛的衝來跌碎了轎子以及酒窖中的一些等。至於搶刦别人反爲被刦者所感動與後面的一場大笑，都是非常好的。</p>
<p>主角台尼斯金過去在歌劇中就有很好的成續，在這片中他飾那大盜FraDiavolo，　英雄，又瀟洒，就劇情來說，確是非常煦合的。此外那個貴族婦人賽爾瑪駝德，也很能表現出貴婦人之醜態，可是有些小地方却嫌過火一些。</p>
<p>關於故事的本身，我們能夠說些什麽呢？有兩個被强盜搶去了僅有的金錢，乃憤而爲盜，冒名大盜弗拉立亞伏洛之名。誰知正遇此人，好像水滸中眞假李逵似的，但立亞伏洛並不殺害他們，反而敎他們化裝僕人而謀盜取某貴婦人之財物。結果，三人被捕，處刑槍决，幸虧戇人自有戇福，終因一牛而拯救他們於臨刑的時候。這故事的勉强和不通，自不待言。如精幹的大盜與二戇大爲伍，如許多有槍的兵士不能殺死一條牛，終至使犯人免脫。</p>
<p>然而我們批判的重心並不在此，因爲有許多劇作者就不一定是Realit，雖然現在的電影至少應當在寫實主義中發展。那末我們現在所說的，却是爲什麽不使大盜正法？我們在好些美國影片中，他們寫大盜的時候，結果必定是死於［大公無私］的國法之下，否則也定是大盜者回心轉意，改過自新，而得着國法的［不咎旣往。］但在這裏却是前後二者之例外，而使大盜們逍遥法外。那末可以解釋這大盜輩都是刦寓濟貧，但除在哈台口中聽着這末一句以外，却完全没有表現於盡面之上。反之，作者却將立亞伏洛，寫成風流潇洒，將戇大寫成純樸天眞，都能得着觀衆的同情。所以，以其說因他們刦富濟貧而該不死，倒不如是爲了博取觀衆的同情面極力討好吧。</p>
<p>不過，這是法國歌劇改編的，是否原劇也是如此，不得而知，同時舞台劇如此改編，除了在旅店中大盜唱歌的一塲，稍有原劇之痕迹以外，全部都是很好的。這當然是因爲電影這東西可以十分靈活運用的原故，就是可見導演之高明。雖然有些笑料未免庸俗，然而全劇的調子確是一貫的活潑而生動。正確的說，這是一部毫無意思而演出甚有趣味的喜劇，一部無内容而極求形式趣味化的歌劇。知然，這趣味是没有何等價值的了。</p>

<p>(Beiping) Tangshan Telegram: Yesterday evening at 8:00 PM, Fang Ji's troops, numbering approximately six to seven hundred, launched an attack on Large and Small Tangshan from Xiangtun Village, Xiao Village, Niufang, and other locations, with reinforcements arriving continuously. They made contact with the National Army at Zhaijiazhuang, a short distance from the Tangshan marketplace. Fang Ji's troops briefly disturbed the vicinity of Tangshan Park, with bullets raining down on the streets and constant gunfire. Order was disrupted. Zhu Hongdong, the 130th Division Commander stationed at Baxianzhuang, immediately dispatched Zhao's regiment as reinforcements. The intense fighting continued until 3:00 AM this morning when Fang Ji's troops began to falter and retreat towards Dongbanbidian, Shangxiayuan, and other areas to the northeast. However, scattered units continued to harass the area near Tangshan. Gunfire was still heard in the marketplace at 8:00 AM this morning. The Ping-Tang telephone line was temporarily out of service last night.

After printing, the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai office and the Central Bank will begin issuing them, paying off old debts to the banking community according to 89% of face value.

<h3 id="e13">Consular Jurisdiction and Reciprocal Tariff Rates <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>—Shi</p>
<p>Japanese diplomatic policy, since Mr. Uchida Yasuya vigorously advocated [Scorched Earth Diplomacy], and then withdrew from the League of Nations internationally, stubbornly insisted on using force to carry out aggression. At that time, it not only aroused displeasure in the United States across the Pacific, but also caused extreme resentment in its former ally, Britain. Storms raged across the Pacific and Indian Oceans, with the final resolution seemingly relying solely on iron and blood. However, although Japanese warlords ran rampant for a time, they were also aware that once Britain and the United States joined forces, they would inevitably be somewhat inferior in terms of naval power. In terms of economic strength, they were indeed not as rich as the United States, and in terms of manipulating the market, they were not as skilled as Britain. If they continued to push forward relentlessly, after the outbreak of World War II, Japan would have no other way out but to follow in the footsteps of Germany during the European War. Therefore, after Hirota came to power, he had to adopt the so-called diplomacy of reason to ease the anti-Japanese sentiment of the British-American alliance. He also adopted a fluctuating and tough attitude towards Russia to show people that he was unpredictable. In fact, Japan's diplomatic policy is the same as before, but it has slightly changed its methods of dealing with the environment.</p>
<p>At the beginning of Hirota's rise to power, we recognized that he would still follow in the footsteps of the warlords and follow Uchida's old ways. The driving force behind the Japanese government is the military. If the military's views do not change, then Japan's diplomatic policy will not change. Uchida worked for the warlords, but he did not fully satisfy the military's intentions, so he had no choice but to resign due to illness. Therefore, Hirota's rise to succeed him will naturally follow the military's intentions. His touted new policy is only limited to political technical work. The recent announcement of advocating the abolition of consular jurisdiction in China is a manifestation of his technical work and a smokescreen released by the Japanese warlords.</p>
<p>The deepening of the economic panic in Japan is no less than that in European and American countries. Superficially, judging from the figures of industrial production, it has not fallen sharply. The selling price index even shows an increase. There are only 450,000 unemployed workers in the country. However, if we examine the essence of the matter carefully, we will know that the increase in the industrial production index is due to the stimulation of military industry. The rise in prices is the result of the decline in the value of currency. The number of unemployed workers is only based on the official one-sided survey and is not the whole picture. As for the expansion of military industry, it is a temporary phenomenon that cannot be sustained for long. Moreover, everyone knows that military industry is a purely consumer undertaking. During wartime or the recovery period of war, it may be able to exert its stimulating effect, but at a time when the world economy is exhausted and the agricultural panic is more severe, the Japanese rural areas are suffering even more due to the low price of rice. Therefore, the military industry is gradually losing its effectiveness. After May of this year, the industrial production index has been declining. This false [boom] will inevitably be exposed. Therefore, the Japanese government is doing its best to try to save the economic crisis. To save this crisis, it has to use its full commercial power to advance into China. This is why it first entices with the empty name of abolishing consular jurisdiction and then uses reciprocal tariff rates as an exchange.</p>
<p>We do not think that deep closure and rejection is the way to deal with diplomatic issues between China and Japan. However, Japan should bear full responsibility for creating today's stalemate and causing disputes between the two nations. How to resolve it in the future is left aside for the time being. Taking the matter of consular jurisdiction alone, it is something that we have been eager to win back for decades. Now that Japan is voluntarily withdrawing, we have no reason to refuse. However, Japan has the exchange condition of reciprocal tariffs before canceling consular jurisdiction. Given China's current economic situation, even if it has tariff autonomy, it is still difficult to stop Japan's dumping of goods. If a reciprocal agreement is reached, I am afraid that China's export of raw materials will still not increase, while the import of Japanese products will arrive like a tide. Moreover, the Japanese army is stationed strongly in China, along the Yangtze River and the coast, and even within the four northeastern provinces, either in the name of protecting overseas Chinese or arbitrarily occupying them. I don't know how many violations of our national sovereignty there are. Then, what is the point of abolishing this trivial consular jurisdiction?</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Shen Baixian, the Director of the Department of Reconstruction of Jiangsu, stated that: (1) After Chairman Chen received his appointment, he prepared to assume his new post. Gu Renfa, the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs, is currently in northern Jiangxi, and Secretary-General Cheng Tianfang is still in Shanghai. He has telegraphed Gu and Cheng to rush to the capital, and they will gather in the capital within days. They will go to Zhenjiang together before the Double Tenth Festival to take over. (2) Chairman Chen is not very clear about the Jiangsu opium public sale, but since opium harms the race and is of great importance, he will strongly advocate strict prohibition in the future. As for the implementation of the "Bu Lian" (joint defense), he will consult with Director Gu in person within days before making a decision on the plan. (3) During Chairman Gu's tenure in Jiangsu, the Department of Finance issued an order to reduce the land tax. This year's summer harvest has already been implemented. This is indeed a great benefit to the farmers. However, the government's income must also be taken into account in order to enrich the provincial treasury and strive for construction. Therefore, it is not yet known whether this matter can maintain the original proposal. It must be investigated by Director Zhao of the Department of Finance, who will make overall arrangements, with the most emphasis on organizing the plan. (4) Regarding the reconstruction of Jiangsu Province, I will follow the central government's intentions and focus on revitalizing the rural areas, vigorously promoting agriculture, so as to increase all production capacity. Among rural undertakings, water conservancy is the most important. This matter should actively promote water conservancy in various areas of the Huaihe River basin in northern Jiangsu, while investigating the conditions of the rural areas, promoting afforestation, and gradually seeking to complete various constructions in Jiangsu Province. (5) As for the position of Deputy Director of the Huai River Management Committee, the government believes that the Huai River is largely important to Jiangsu Province. Therefore, during the period when a successor has not been determined, Chairman Chen must still concurrently manage it in order to be familiar with it. As for the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Committee, after I go to Jiangsu, Vice Chairman Chen intends to request He Yushu, the former Jiangsu Provincial Committee member, to succeed him. Yesterday, the Central Committee has already announced him as a member of the Huai River Management Committee. (5th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) Negotiations on British and American war debts are about to begin, and rumors and speculations are rampant. However, there are several distinctive features among them. Britain's view has always been that the solution to the war debt problem must be based on its own interests. What London is currently worried about is that the United States may use war debts to force Britain to adopt attempts similar to the American New Deal, which would hinder the country's current trend of natural recovery of British industry. As for the United States' current hope, it is only for Britain to make another credit-worthy repayment. What the United States is most concerned about is its own domestic problems, with war debts being secondary. At the same time, American farmers, dissatisfied with the slow rise in prices, are now calling for currency inflation, but the American Federation of Labor opposes this move, as it will hinder the demand for higher wages. American bankers are now unwilling to easily extend loans, because they are uncertain about the future value of the loans currently being issued. U.S. dollars are still flowing out steadily. (Thousands of Americans are opening accounts with Swiss banks.) Washington's opinion is that the issue of currency stability and British tariff concessions to the United States are more important than war debt negotiations. However, the decision on the war debt issue rests with the Congress, which will convene in a month, and it is expected that its previous firm attitude will not change. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Ambassador to Japan Jiang Zuobin has decided to return to his post on the 7th aboard the Chichibu Maru from Shanghai. Foreign Minister Hirota, after Ambassador Jiang returns, will advocate the following points and strategies for breaking the deadlock in Sino-Japanese relations:</p>
<p>(1) Persuade China to recognize the fact that the fundamental interests of China and Japan are consistent, and abandon the policy of "using barbarians to control barbarians," which is harmful and useless to peace in the East.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding the relationship between China and Manchukuo, persuade China to recognize the fact that the sound development of Manchuria is beneficial to China's own political and economic interests, and adopt a generous attitude of frankly acknowledging the established facts.</p>
<p>(3) Indicate that Japan will provide assistance to China's own construction work based on pure friendship and affection.</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota will begin to act autonomously towards China based on the above policies, and will also express to Ambassador Jiang his ambition to jointly strive to break the Sino-Japanese relations.</p>

Chief Cabinet Secretary Horikiri strongly denied the resignation of Naval Minister Osumi, but many in the Navy admitted the resignation theory. As a result, they will wait for the opportunity to complete the judgment of the May 15th Incident at the end of this month, and resign before the formation of the budget for the next year in November.

Also, the draft is currently being kept strictly secret.

As for the complete abolition of consular jurisdiction, it has always been our country's consistent diplomatic policy, and the government authorities have repeatedly declared its recovery. It cannot be attached with conditions. Therefore, those who want to use the abandonment of consular jurisdiction as an exchange condition for obtaining special tariff treatment are truly dreaming.

<p>(Tokyo) According to the telegram from the Imperial Representative Sawada to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at the Simla Conference on the 3rd, Director-General Bowyer asked the Japanese side the following questions: (1) Does Japan intend to protect and purchase a certain amount of raw cotton? (2) Should restrictions on export quantities also apply to competing products other than the cotton industry, such as rayon fabrics and cotton-wool fabrics? (3) How about measures against low exchange rates? In addition, he requested that export control consider both quantity and price. Representative Sawada replied: (1) If Japan restricts export quantities, India should naturally reduce tariffs. (2) Restricting prices is unnecessary because Japanese cotton cloth only accounts for 10% of the total exports to India and does not affect the Indian market. (3) Judging from the current situation in Japan, it is difficult to suppress the refusal to buy Indian cotton, and it is impossible to guarantee a certain amount of purchase, etc., requesting India's reflection. However, there is still a gap between the two sides' claims, so the future seems to be full of difficulties. (5th Denstu Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Harbin) The dispute over the China Eastern Railway is intensifying. On September 26, the Manchukuo side sent Cui Guilin as the director of the Manchouli Railway Materials Office, learning Japanese. Rudy, the director of the railway bureau, also appointed the Russian Revizsky to this position. When the Manchukuo personnel arrived in Manchouli, Revizsky did not allow them to take office.

After this case occurred, Rudy telegraphed all officials on October 1st and 2nd, ordering them not to follow the orders of the Manchukuo-appointed acting director of the transportation department. Thereupon, Deputy Director Zhang Mingqi (translation) also sent a telegram to resist Rudy's orders. According to news from the Manchukuo side in Harbin, Rudy's telegram was issued immediately, while Zhang's telegram was only issued at midnight on October 3rd. The Manchukuo side also pointed out that Soviet Russia is now relying on the strength of the Red Army to continue implementing illegal policies. The [Manchukuo] judicial authorities have stated to the press that the rumors that [Manchukuo] plans to release the four Russian officials of the China Eastern Railway arrested on September 24th are not true. According to reports, these four Russian officials were arrested for being accused of driving 79 locomotives from Manchukuo into Russian territory.

<h3 id="e38">The Philippine Permanent Neutrality Plan: After the Pacific Relations Countries Conclude a Treaty, the United States Will Return Sovereignty to the Filipinos <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) The Philippine political leaders are determined to reject the Philippine Independence Act and send another committee to Washington to petition. Several members of Congress here do not agree, saying that the independence issue may not be easily re-listed on the agenda of both houses of Congress. It is expected that if the Filipinos send a new delegation to the United States, they will be coldly received by the Americans. However, it is currently heard that the leaders of the Philippine independence faction have proposed a completely new plan, advocating that Congress authorize the government to withdraw from the island as soon as it concludes a neutrality treaty for the Philippine Islands with the countries related to the Pacific, and return sovereignty to the Filipinos without having to enact another bill through Congress. At this time, people in the government are quite puzzled by the actions of the Philippine Kuishun faction. A certain high-ranking official claimed that the government supports the existing Philippine Independence Act and considers it fair and impartial. He believes that Congress can be asked to pass a preferential tariff so that the island's goods can continue to be sold in the American market, just like Cuba. He considers this the fairest way. Once the preferential tariff is formulated and the neutrality treaty is concluded, the United States can withdraw from the Philippine Islands. However, the high-ranking official predicted that although a majority in Congress may be willing to give up the Philippine Islands, it is doubtful whether they will agree to the preferential tariff, because the three most powerful agricultural groups in the country are demanding that all goods from the Philippine Islands be subject to full tariffs. As for the neutrality treaty, it is appropriate to negotiate with the six countries of Great Britain, Japan, France, the Netherlands, China, and Russia first, and then invite other countries to join. It does not matter whether they are concluded separately or a multilateral convention is concluded. Furthermore, a survey of members of Congress today revealed that most of the members who have advocated giving the Filipinos independence for more than ten years do not approve of the Filipinos' behavior. In addition, they advocate unconditional independence after the conclusion of the neutrality treaty, and then levy the same tariffs on Philippine goods as on goods from other countries. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) It was just learned that people in the U.S. Congress had anticipated that the Filipinos would give up the opportunity given by the Philippine Independence Act. At present, all members of Congress say that since the Philippine dignitaries do not want to submit the case to the people for a referendum, the entire independence issue has been transferred from the legislative branch to the executive branch. Congress will no longer discuss Philippine independence until the President makes a recommendation. As for the U.S. President's attitude, there is still no indication at present, but it is expected that he will take a holistic view of Philippine independence and strive to coordinate various policies such as territorial islands, agriculture, and navy, and will not necessarily satisfy the wishes of Philippine politicians.

<p>Vienna - The motive of the assassin of Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss, Teitel, for shooting Dollfuss is still uncertain. Teitel himself does not admit to being a member of the National Socialist Party and claims that he has no affection for members of the National Socialist Party. The assassination of the Prime Minister was a recent decision made by him personally, and no one else instigated it, he said. Teitel appears to be a person with an unclear mind and is also very foolish, it is said. Furthermore, it has been learned that Teitel is the illegitimate son of an old spinster. Later, the old spinster married a man named Gonder. Teitel claimed that his stepfather could save the country from danger, so his shooting of Dollfuss was also intended to draw national attention to Gonder. After the incident, the police searched Teitel's residence and found many political writings, but they could not prove any relationship between him and the National Socialist Party. During the interrogation, Teitel was very calm. When asked about the assassination, he repeatedly said that he wanted to draw people's attention to his stepfather, Gonder, because Gonder was the only talent who could save Austria. Gonder, who currently lives in Schleiming, has been questioned by local authorities. However, Gonder proved that he had nothing to do with Teitel's actions, so he was released immediately. Teitel's mother was also questioned and released. Both husband and wife claimed that they had never known Teitel to join any political party. Therefore, the general opinion is that Teitel is a young man with a boring life, and his behavior is also incomprehensible. (4th National Telegram)</p>

<p>Havana - Order in Cuba is gradually being restored. British expatriates who had sought refuge in hotels during the period of panic and bloodshed have now returned home. Some women are now begging newspapers to help them find their missing relatives and friends. The losses suffered by the National Hotel due to the bombing are estimated at $150,000. During the bombardment, the President's armored car was hit 30 times. President San Martin has announced a plan to restore order and said that the government is willing to guarantee the lives of the 368 military officers currently in detention. Washington is still taking a wait-and-see attitude, but many Americans believe that President San Martin's power is gradually waning and that a military dictator will succeed him.

<p>Quantico - The U.S. Marine Corps has a battalion heading to Hampton Roads today, possibly because the base here is not enough for training, or for other reasons. They will board the battleship USS Wyoming and immediately sail to the Caribbean for training. An officer said that this trip was only for training purposes and, as far as he knew, had nothing to do with intervention in Cuba. But when a reporter asked if the USS Wyoming would not be in a more convenient position in case of major disturbances in Cuba, the officer smiled and did not answer. (4th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Havana - The major hurricane that swept through Cuba yesterday has weakened slightly this morning. Wherever it passed, small boats were washed ashore, houses collapsed, traffic was blocked, and rubble was everywhere. Last night, after dark, looting occurred, so troops were dispatched to patrol the streets. A team saw people looting a store on a main thoroughfare, arrested two people, briefly conducted a military trial, and executed them immediately. Many thugs rushed into the American shipping company Grace &amp; Co. and robbed them of hundreds of dollars. Upon hearing the news, the government's Army Commander Batista immediately went to the U.S. Embassy and met with the U.S. Ambassador. The U.S. Ambassador demanded that the Cuban government explain the looting and provide further guarantees for the safety of the lives and property of American citizens. The U.S. Ambassador's tough attitude and the news that a battalion of U.S. Marines was heading to the Caribbean for training have revived fears of American intervention here. The search for opposition leaders continues, even in the midst of wind and rain, but has yielded no results. Yesterday afternoon, rumors spread that former President Menocal was hiding on a U.S. warship, but this was denied by U.S. authorities. The center of the hurricane is now heading towards the Gulf of Mexico, approaching the southern tip of Florida in the United States. (5th National Telegram)</p>

<p>(London) Former Commander of the British Fleet in China, Sir Kelly, spoke here today to British businessmen with ties to the Far East about the strong developments within China, saying that China has moved from absolute autocracy to a democratic system for which it is not prepared. In his opinion, there can be no hope of a unified China until its language is unified, its currency is standardized, and its transportation is adequate. Not all Chinese cabinet members can manage state affairs on their own. Often, the pressure of public opinion prevents them from implementing the events they support. He believes that China's future depends on the safety of life, industry, and capital. What is currently needed is to seek security and a stable government. The political system currently suitable for China is a federal government that allows each province and region to enjoy full autonomy. (5th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The National Coal Merchants Association had requested the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to levy a dumping tax on foreign coal to save the industry. The Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to deliberate on the matter. After the representatives of the three ministries studied the matter, they all agreed that if the levy was implemented at this time, the price of domestic coal would inevitably increase at any time. At the same time, major domestic factories would also increase their costs, which would hinder industrial development. The discussion situation has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. The Executive Yuan attaches great importance to this matter and is now hiring experts to study it further. No hasty decision will be made at this time. (5th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>The history of the Japanese Army's aviation predates that of the Navy. In 1910, Lieutenant Tokugawa (now promoted to Major General and Principal of the Army Flying School) brought back an Henri Farman biplane from France. This marked the beginning of military aircraft imports, and he was also Japan's first aviator. In the same year, Major Hino brought back a Grade monoplane with 25 horsepower from Germany, and flew it at the Yoyogi training ground in Tokyo on December 19, 1910. These two aircraft were the first military aircraft of the Japanese Army. The following year, a Rad biplane and a Pralia monoplane were purchased. In 1912, the Army Flying School was established. In the same year, Major General Tokugawa personally copied a biplane equipped with a Gnome engine and flew it between Tokyo and Tokorozawa. Since then, Japanese-made military aircraft have gradually appeared. In 1913, two Maurice Farman biplanes (Renault 70 horsepower) and one Nieuport monoplane (50 horsepower) were purchased from France. Soon after, the Army adopted the Farman aircraft as the standard model and manufactured it at the Army factory using Japanese materials. This Maurice Farman type is the Nakajima-manufactured biplane, equipped with a 150-horsepower Hall-Scott engine, and used in the Army flying squadrons. During the European War, Japan only dispatched one army corps to attack Qingdao and sent some aviators to the Western Front. However, at that time, it was considered that there was a lack of practical experience. After the war ended, in order to remedy the deficiencies, Colonel Foulques, a famous French Air Force officer, was invited to Japan to teach. The progress of the Japanese flying squadrons today is entirely due to the French. After the war, a large number of British and French aircraft were purchased again. The first Army fighter jets were imported from France in 1922, namely SPAD S.XIII and Nieuport 29C (300 horsepower). Later, the Nakajima Aircraft Manufacturing Plant copied many Nieuport models. Since 1925, the standard of aircraft used by the Army has been the Salmson 230-horsepower reconnaissance aircraft manufactured by Kawasaki and the Army Factory (total weight 2552 pounds, maximum speed 112 miles, climb speed to 3300 feet in 4 minutes, to 9800 feet in 13 minutes 10 seconds, endurance 3 hours), and the Nakajima-made Ise-Hispano 300-horsepower fighter aircraft (total weight 2552 pounds, maximum speed 130 miles, climb speed to 3300 feet in 3 minutes 20 seconds, to 9800 feet in 10 minutes 50 seconds). The following is a list of the main types of aircraft currently used by the Japanese Navy.</p>

<p>The Japanese Army Aviation Department has been working very hard on inspecting aircraft performance and research over the years, and is particularly interested in large all-metal bombers. In 1927, the Kawasaki factory manufactured an aircraft equipped with two Kawasaki Tern-Dornier 450-horsepower BMW engines, which has been adopted by the Army. Other aircraft, such as the light bomber with a Nakajima-made biplane and an Ise-Hispano 450-horsepower engine manufactured by Mitsubishi Aircraft Co., Ltd., are also considered to have excellent performance. The performance of the aircraft currently used in the Army airfields is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Kawasaki Ternier heavy bomber, equipped with two Kawasaki BMW 450-horsepower engines (weight 9680 pounds, total weight 16823 pounds, maximum speed 106 miles, climb speed to 3300 feet in 10 minutes 55 seconds, to 9800 feet in 44 minutes 10 seconds, endurance 5 hours)</p>
<p>(2) Mitsubishi-made light bomber, equipped with an Ise-Hispano 450-horsepower engine (weight 4088 pounds, total weight 7320 pounds, maximum speed 112 miles, climb speed to 3300 feet in 9 minutes 50 seconds, 9800 feet in 56 minutes 45 seconds, endurance 3 hours)</p>
<p>In 1928, the Army Flying Squad held a flying competition. The Ishikawa-jima T-3 biplane (Kawasaki BMW 450 horsepower), the Nakajima N-35 (Nakajima Lorraine 650 horsepower), the Mitsubishi biplane (Mitsubishi Ise-Hispano 450 horsepower), the Kawasaki Type 88 biplane (Kawasaki BMW 450 horsepower), etc., were combined for reconnaissance and bombing battles. The Kawasaki aircraft was the most outstanding, so the Type 88 reconnaissance bomber was adopted. This Kawasaki aircraft is equipped with a Kawasaki BMW 450-horsepower engine. It is an all-metal biplane with the following performance (weight 3872 pounds, total weight 6270 pounds, maximum speed 124 miles, minimum speed 59 miles, climb speed to 3300 feet in 4 minutes 50 seconds, to 9800 feet in 15 minutes 45 seconds, to 16400 feet in 35 minutes 15 seconds, endurance 4-5 hours). It has been modified many times since then, becoming the Type 88-2, and its performance is even greater. In 1930, a Japanese-initiated fighter competition was held, and the Nakajima-made monoplane (Cubitt 450 horsepower) was adopted as the Type 90 fighter. In 1932, the Kawashima-made biplane (500 horsepower Kawasaki BMW engine) was adopted as the Type 92 fighter. In the same year, the Mitsubishi monoplane light reconnaissance aircraft (Mitsubishi Argyle 420 horsepower) was adopted as the standard aircraft. The Japanese Army Air Force now has a supply of domestically produced aircraft, and its air power can gradually compete with the world. Recently, during the Manchurian Incident, taking advantage of China's lack of air force equipment, it greatly exerted its power. According to the Army's current [preparation for patriotism], the latest Type 1933 two-seater fighters and liaison aircraft are currently being urgently manufactured by private companies entrusted by the military. Mitsubishi Aircraft Manufacturing Co., Ltd. is also imitating the Junkers G.38 all-metal super heavy bomber in order to strengthen the first line of air defense, but its contents are not detailed. The following is a list of the general outline of the first-class aircraft currently in use by the Japanese Army.</p>

<h3 id="e74">Chairman Chiang Strictly Prohibits the Army from Press-Ganging <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Chairman Chiang believes that the army's press-ganging is most likely to arouse public resentment, and has repeatedly issued orders to strictly prohibit it. However, there are still several armies that knowingly violate the ban. He has issued another order to the Commanders-in-Chief of the various routes to suppress bandits to relay the order to all departments and strictly prohibit it. The original order is as follows: [For your obedience, it is found that forced press-ganging is most likely to arouse popular resentment and hinder military operations, and has been strictly prohibited in the past. Recently, according to reports from the county magistrates and inspectors of various counties, the various armies and units still often engage in press-ganging, or change the method to forcibly ask local governments to provide a certain number of laborers, which often makes local governments unable to cope and have to send police to forcibly press-gang. In this situation, although the press-ganging comes from the local government, the resentment is still directed at the army, which is extremely detrimental to the suppression of bandits and has a great impact. If this is not changed drastically, the future danger is unbearable to describe. Therefore, I reiterate my stern warning that hereafter, whether in the process of suppressing or clearing bandits, the troops can only use the original laborers. If there are not enough, they can only carry less baggage or have soldiers help with transportation. Press-ganging is absolutely not allowed, and no means are allowed to be changed to forcibly instruct others to carry out press-ganging. Anyone who violates this will be punished according to military law to serve as a warning. Furthermore, these incidents are often committed by lower-ranking officers, and higher-ranking officers are negligent in detecting them, resulting in the deterioration of military discipline and public resentment. The various senior and middle-ranking officers are still ignorant, which is far from the main point of my repeated instructions to see, speak, act, and move. The harm is extreme. As for the political training personnel of the various units, they have the responsibility of connecting military-civilian feelings, assisting local governments, and reducing public suffering. If the various units do not abide by military discipline and harass the people, they should immediately conduct a detailed investigation, take responsibility for stopping them, and secretly report to this headquarters for verification and handling. Local governments, in the face of national crisis, can also report the matter to senior officers as much as possible, and should not protect their positions and engage in practices that harm the people. In addition to separate orders, this order is hereby issued for your obedience and relay to your subordinates. Be sure to obey this order.]</p>
<h3 id="e75">Henan Province, Fengqiu and Chenliu Request Disaster Relief. Disaster Situation is Also Severe in Both Counties. Disaster Victims Have No Clothes or Food. <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Kaifeng Communication: This year, the Yellow River has caused harm. In Henan Province, the most severely affected counties are Hua County, Kaocheng, Lanfeng, and Wen County. Few people pay attention to Fengqiu and Chenliu, which are relatively lightly affected counties. Now it is deep autumn, and the people in the disaster areas have no clothes or food. Although the government has repeatedly stated that it will provide emergency relief, it is only a drop in the bucket, and it is difficult to keep them alive. In addition, the epidemic has recurred, and the people are living in dire straits. Every day, there are several requests to the provincial relief association for relief and medicine. The petitions from Fengqiu and Chenliu counties are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e76">Fengqiu Requests Construction Relief <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>The construction relief methods proposed by Fengqiu County: (1) Digging ditches. It is found that there are three old ditches in the county, namely Wenyang, Tianran, and Zhiju. The Wenyang ditch starts from Sanlizhuang in the northwest of the county, connects with the ditch in Yanjiin County, and ends at the Zhifang Cliff in Changyuan County in the northeast, with a total length of more than 60 li. The Tianran ditch starts from the DaCunji in the west of the county, connects with the Yangwu ditch, and enters the Wenyang ditch at the RanGuzhuang north of the city, with a total length of more than 30 li. The Zhiju ditch starts from the XiaoSunzhuang in the southwest of the county and enters the Tianran ditch at the Sangcun north of the county, with a total length of more than 40 li. There are 13 important bridges on the upstream and downstream of each ditch. All of them have been silted up due to years of disrepair, the channels are blocked, and the bridges have collapsed. Once there is accumulated water, there is nowhere to discharge, and it floods and causes disasters. It is proposed to recruit disaster victims to the three ditches and provide construction relief separately to dig and repair the bridges, a total of 13, to facilitate travel. It is found that the total length of each ditch is more than 130 li. Each li requires 300 workers, and each worker is paid 30 cents a day, totaling 10,700 yuan in relief funds. Each of the 13 bridges requires 10,000 bricks, and the labor cost is 30 yuan. Each brick costs 1 cent, totaling 100 yuan. The total cost of labor and materials for each bridge is 130 yuan. The 13 bridges require a total of 1,690 yuan. The total calculation above requires 12,390 yuan, which can accommodate 5,000 disaster victims. It is requested to start construction relief quickly to provide relief and eliminate floods. (2) Repairing the city and digging moats, repairing and reinforcing dikes. It is found that Fengqiu County City has been in disrepair for a long time. The city towers, city shrines, city parapets, and foundations have many defects and collapses. Pedestrians enter and exit as if walking on flat ground. The moats outside the city have all been silted up. The protective embankment has also been damaged due to years of construction. In 1930, the garrison dug trenches all over the embankment, which was bumpy and uneven, causing further damage. If it is not repaired, it will not be enough for defense. Now is the year of famine, the atmosphere of bandits is restless, and floods occur frequently, so it cannot be regarded as a slow plan. It has been carefully estimated that repairing the city embankment and digging the city moat will require 8,000 yuan in relief funds, to provide relief through construction, which can achieve several benefits at once. (3) Establishing factories. It is found that Fengqiu is a remote small town, and most people are engaged in agriculture. Once there is a natural disaster, they are almost helpless. They do not pay attention to crafts, and there are many idle people. Now is the autumn of commercial warfare, and crafts should be the foundation. Without paying attention to crafts, there is no way to save the people's livelihood. It is proposed to establish factories, hire male and female technicians, and divide them into dyeing, weaving, woodworking, bamboo work, grass hat braiding, soap, and candle making. Recruit young men and women from the disaster victims, and learn by category. In the present time, construction relief can be provided. In the long term, industry can be developed, and everyone can be self-reliant in the future, and there will be fewer idle people. As the saying goes, [It is better to have a skill than to have millions of family assets]. It is not an exaggeration. It is estimated that the purchase of machinery, materials, and office expenses will require about 10,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Chenliu Requests Allocation of Disaster Relief Funds <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Chenliu County submitted a document stating, [I have secretly investigated that the fourth district of this county, which is located within the Yellow River embankment, has suffered a severe flood, submerging more than ten villages, destroying hundreds of acres of farmland, and flooding no less than two hundred people. The houses buried are estimated to be in the tens of thousands. All of these miserable situations have been truthfully reported by the former Executive Committee, and the council approved and transferred the matter to the Henan Province Relief Association for verification and handling. The county government has also approved the provincial committee to re-investigate the cases. It is reasonable to wait for the implementation of relief, how can there be room for repeated appeals? However, thousands of bereaved people in the disaster area are exposed to the wind and dew, and cannot withstand the cold and hunger. Due to the mixed atmosphere, there has been an outbreak of epidemics. The sick are still under the open sky, and those who are hungry are pale and emaciated. All the so-called disasters of soldiers, bandits, drought, and locusts do not have such a miserable appearance. All the needs of rice, grain, and miscellaneous items have been swept away by the east. The remaining old and weak are only breathing. Only a breath remains, and they are still hoping to continue their lives. Although the headquarters has discussed with the county government and various agencies to raise 90 stones of relief grain in advance, and rushed to the area to distribute emergency relief, the average distribution is less than two liters per person, which is equivalent to a value of less than one cent. It is a drop in the bucket, and it is difficult to help. The righteous grain and benevolent soup are urgently awaited to be issued. Therefore, I once again request the council to reply to the flood relief agency and quickly allocate relief funds and medicine to expand the relief. The gratitude of the disaster victims will not be in vain. (October 2nd)</p>

<p>—The Department of Construction Has Planned and Surveyed—</p>
<p>Xi'an Communication: The Shaanxi Provincial Government previously received a telegram from Chairman Chiang instructing it to construct the Xilao Highway (from Xi'an to Laohekou), which connects this province to Hubei and Henan, and the Fenglong Highway (from Feng County to Malu Town in Long County), which connects this province to Longnan. It was ordered that the Department of Construction should first conduct surveys and designs. The Department of Construction has now drafted an outline for the organization of the survey team and a budget for survey and mapping fees, and submitted them to the provincial government for approval and allocation of funds in order to actively carry out the work. The original presentation stated, [In accordance with your government's Order No. 1580, Chairman Chiang sent a secret telegram ordering the construction of highways in this province connecting Gansu, Hubei, and Henan. We are ordered to provide detailed plans and surveys. While we were complying with the order, we received your government's Order No. 1644, which stated, 'For your compliance, it is found that at the 24th meeting of the committee of this government, the chairman proposed that highways in this province connecting Gansu, Hubei, and Henan should be quickly planned in detail, surveyed on the ground, and funds should be raised for the survey first. The decision was made to hand it over to the Department of Construction to first survey the two roads from Xi'an to Laohekou and from Xi'an to the border of Southern Gansu, and to draw up a plan and estimate the survey expenses and submit them for review, etc., as recorded in the minutes. I have investigated this case and found that I previously received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, which I have complied with and reported back to the Department of Construction for compliance. Therefore, I urgently order the department to immediately comply, quickly conduct surveys on the two roads mentioned above, formulate a plan for the dirt road and several roads separately, and estimate the survey expenses and submit them for review in a consolidated case. This is for your observation and decision. In accordance with this, I have found that the section of the highway connecting Gansu and Qingshui in this province is more important. This road is 270 li long, and the budget requires 500 yuan for survey and start-up expenses, and 5,652.5 yuan for survey and mapping expenses, totaling 6,152.5 yuan. It will take two and a half months to complete. In addition, the main road connecting this province to Hubei is the Xijing Road, which starts from Xi'an, passes through Lantian, Shang County, Shangluo, and reaches Jingziguan, with a total length of 660 li. The budget requires 500 yuan for survey and start-up expenses, and 12,453.5 yuan for survey and mapping expenses, totaling 12,953.5 yuan. It will take five and a half months to complete. Before the actual survey is conducted, it is difficult to accurately design the project. A detailed design should be made after the actual survey. In accordance with the order, I have drafted an outline for the organization of the survey team and a budget for survey and mapping fees, and submitted them for your approval and allocation of funds for actual measurement, which is for the public good.] The outline of the survey team's organization is omitted.

<p>—Implementing a Unified Policy to Improve Sericulture—</p>
<p>—Improving Cotton Industry and Breeding Millions of Cotton Seeds—</p>
<p>Zhejiang Province has always been an agricultural area, but in recent years, the province's annual output of grains and wheat has been less than 24 million dan, and the output of cotton has been less than 600,000 dan, which has a significant impact on people's food and clothing. Even sericulture, which has a good reputation, is also declining. The rural economy is increasingly declining, and the industrial and commercial sectors are also in danger. In view of this, the Department of Construction has taken separate measures to improve and promote it. The following is an overview of its work in recent years.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Revitalizing Agriculture <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>For the improvement of agriculture, the Department of Construction formed an agricultural committee last summer, invited experts to study, and set up a training institute for agricultural extension workers in Wenjiayan, Xiaoshan this spring to train agricultural extension workers in various counties, encourage people to afforest, and promote bee keeping, horse raising, sheep raising, and the protection of cattle and other sideline occupations. These are all active work. A Bureau of Entomology was established to take charge of pest control, and a training institute for pest control personnel was established to train pest control personnel. In addition, in order to address the damage to rice and wheat caused by farmers' unlimited use of chemical fertilizers, a management office was established to ban it. These are all passive work. The more important of its active works are the following:</p>
<h3 id="e81">Improving Sericulture <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>In view of the decline of sericulture, the Department of Construction urged the sericulture farm to produce high-quality original seeds, supervised private seed farms to produce non-toxic silkworm seeds, and banned native species. In the autumn of last year, the first model area for improving sericulture was established in Nansha, Xiaoshao, to promote excellent varieties and guide farmers to raise autumn silkworms. This year, a second model area for improving sericulture was added in Lin'an, and sericulture improvement areas were established in Wuxing, Jiaxing, Haiyan, Haining, Changxing, Hangzhou, Deqing, Shengxian, Wukang, Zhuji, Yuhang, and other counties to facilitate promotion. In order to unite all sectors to thoroughly improve sericulture, the department also organized the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Sericulture Unified Control Committee with the Jiangsu Department of Construction and leaders of the sericulture industry in the fall of last year to implement a unified policy. The purchase and sale of silkworm seeds, the amount of seed rearing, disinfection, and cocoon collection should all be subject to its control. This is about the improvement aspect. However, the decline of silk industry, the active improvement of the treatment is a radical cure, and the sales of old silk and old cocoons is even more urgent. For this reason, the Department of Construction repeatedly discussed with the Ministry of Industry, the Jiangsu Department of Construction, and the Shanghai financial industry this spring to organize the Jiangsu-Zhejiang Committee for Old Silk and Old Cocoon and the Committee for Promoting the Sales of Old Silk, and tried to promote sales. The National Government issued a short-term public bond of 3 million yuan for the silk industry in Jiangsu and Zhejiang to subsidize exports. In May, it also met with the Department of Finance and the financial industry in Hangzhou to decide that the financial industry would organize the Zhejiang Provincial Silver and Money Industry Joint Committee for Releasing Cocoon Funds to raise 1.8 million yuan in cash for relief. Although all these methods are temporary solutions, they are beneficial to the silk farmers in various counties.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Improving the Cotton Industry <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>According to a survey in 1931, the area planted with cotton in Zhejiang Province totaled 1,981,187 mu, and the annual output of ginned cotton was 519,644 dan. However, the province's total consumption is about 1.1 million dan per year, a shortage of 600,000 dan. In view of this, the Department of Construction specially invited cotton industry experts, representatives from various yarn factories and banks to hold a cotton production meeting in November last year, and ordered the cotton farms and related cotton-producing counties to comply with the resolutions. The Provincial Cotton Farm itself propagated millions of cotton seeds, estimated at 18,820 jin. In addition, more than 60,000 jin were collected from the private sector. After strict selection, about 1,220 jin of good seeds were obtained, which can be promoted to more than 10,000 mu of cotton fields. At the same time, the cotton industry institutions were also improved. The Hangzhou Breeding Farm was changed to the Qibao Breeding Area, expanding the cotton fields to 160 mu, specializing in the cotton production improvement project along the Yangtze River in western Zhejiang. The Xinpu Coastal Branch and the Zhuxiang Branch were both changed to breeding areas, specializing in the cotton industry improvement project along the coast of eastern Zhejiang. In addition, more than 300 mu of new cotton fields were opened in the Toutang area of Xiaoshan to establish the Toutang Breeding Area, which also handles the cotton production improvement project along the Yangtze River in eastern Zhejiang. The original Yuyao, Cixi, Pinghu, Shangyu, Xiaoshan, and other branch farms and breeding areas were changed to cooperative cotton farms, jointly managed with the county governments.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Adjusting Finance <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The establishment of the Department was due to the increasing bankruptcy of the rural economy. As a plan for reforming the economy, in May of the seventeenth year, it guided the organization of cooperatives and established a training program for cooperative business guidance personnel to cultivate such personnel. There were two phases, totaling seventy-six people. As of the end of June this year, a total of 720 societies had been reported to the Department and approved for registration, with 19,558 members, a total share capital of 89,561 yuan, and a guarantee amount of 124,518 yuan. In order to arouse farmers' interest and belief in cooperative businesses, a rural cooperative business experimental area was established in Qibao, Hangzhou, in March of this year to set up a cooperative model. It is also planned to set up a second rural cooperative business experimental area in Yongjia, which is currently under preparation. Furthermore, in order to regulate farmers' finances, the provincial government allocated 500,000 yuan of capital from the summer of the seventeenth year to the autumn of the eighteenth year as shares in the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank, establishing a branch in Hangzhou, and successively allocating 327,000 yuan of farmer loan funds to lend to various rural cooperatives for agricultural production purposes. As for farmer financial institutions in various counties, those that have established county farmer banks include Jiaxing and six other counties, with a total capital exceeding 400,000 yuan; those that have established farmer lending offices include Jiashan and twenty-one other counties, with a total capital of more than 257,000 yuan; those that have established farmer bank preparatory offices include Wuyi and nine other counties, with a total capital reaching more than 19,000 yuan; and Tonglu is the one county that has established a farmer lending office preparatory office, having raised 5,000 yuan. In total, farmer financial institutions have been established in 37 counties throughout the province, with a total capital reaching more than 682,000 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Prospecting for Minerals <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province is rich in mineral deposits in various counties. The Mineral Products Office under the Department has divided the province into five zones for investigation, collecting various mineral products, specimens, and displaying and testing them separately. It has also organized a drilling team to drill and prospect for geological mineral deposits. The areas that have been investigated include the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway line in the first district in the nineteenth year; the second district from Lanxi to Xiaoshan and from Jiande to Suian in the twentieth year; the Xuanping silver mine, Yiwu coal field, and mineral products in various counties along the Xin'an River basin in the third district from Yongjia via Qingtian, Lishui, Yunhe and other six counties in the twenty-first year. The places that have been drilled successively include the Xucun water source, the coal fields of Jiangshan and Yiwu, the geology of the Haining Tang'an, and the bridge foundation of the Jinhua River Bridge.</p>

<p>Zhejiang Province was originally a prosperous place, but in recent years, internal and external troubles, and the squeeze of civil strife have led to the increasing decline of the rural economy. Not only is it difficult to start new businesses, but even existing businesses are in jeopardy. The authorities are therefore encouraging, protecting, guiding, and assisting, taking into account all aspects. For manufacturers, they promote domestic goods. Since the nineteenth year, they have held domestic goods exhibitions every year. For laborers, they send personnel to inspect factories. If there are any factories that do not comply with the Factory Law, they will be severely punished, and it is stipulated that all factories, companies, shops, etc. that employ 50 to 200 workers must set up labor education or labor classes. Currently, 44 counties and cities have reported the situation of handling labor education to the Department of Construction.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Electrical Businesses <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>The electrical business is of great importance to the development of industry and commerce. After the electrical business in Zhejiang Province was taken over by the government, the Electrical Bureau was established. In the winter of the nineteenth year, the provincial government vigorously implemented austerity measures, and in order to save more than 60,000 yuan in administrative expenses each year, the bureau was abolished. All electrical businesses were handled by the Department of Construction. Later, in order to complete the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, the authorities entrusted the operation of the four public power plants in Hangzhou, Haining, Yuhang, and Si'an to the Qixin Banking Syndicate with an overdraft limit of 3 million yuan in national currency. The syndicate returned the collateral paid by the former government, totaling 1.9 million yuan in face value of construction bonds, and repaid the principal and interest of the government shares in installments. During the entrustment period, the Department of Construction successively supervised and ordered the Qixin Banking Syndicate in the twenty-first year to complete the equipment of the new Hangzhou power plant and the main line project of the electrical grid. In July of the twenty-first year, the authorities continued to raise funds for the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, and transferred the entire assets of the plant and its affiliated power plants, as well as the exclusive electrical rights, to the Qixin Banking Syndicate for a price of 6.6 million yuan. After clearing everything, there was still approximately 1 million yuan left. Since these four power plants were transferred to the syndicate, all power plants in the province were privately operated. Currently, there are more than 120 power plants in the province. There is a lack of both capital and talent. The Department of Construction should send personnel to investigate and provide on-site guidance in order to improve them. In the twentieth year, local administrative organs were instructed to strictly pursue users who owed fees, and requests to add small surcharges were rejected. Protection, guidance, and rectification of private power companies are being taken care of in all aspects.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Rectifying the Fisheries Industry <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Zhejiang Province has a coastline of more than a thousand miles, with rivers crisscrossing the interior, and lakes, ponds, and pools scattered everywhere. The richness of aquatic products is the best in the Southeast. Dinghai originally had a fisheries school and a aquatic product manufacturing factory. In the past three years, in addition to allocating 10,000 yuan to purchase instruments and build aquaculture experimental pools for the fisheries school, the authorities have also hired experts to give lectures, and allocated funds to send students to various fishing vessels for internships and to investigate coastal aquatic products to improve the students' level. The admission qualification has been changed from graduation from elementary school to graduation from junior high school. The study period has been changed from five years to three years, and an aquaculture department has been established. For the aquatic product manufacturing factory, the organization has been improved, a factory director has been appointed, the Minsheng fishing vessel has been transferred to the factory, and another guarantee has been given to raise funds, and 15,000 yuan has been overdrawn from the Dinghai Local Bank for the purpose of collecting fresh and refrigerated products. A total of 16 fishing trips were made in one year, with a catch of 363,732 catties. Up to the end of June in the twenty-second year, 12 fishing trips were made, with a catch of 177,302 catties.</p>
<h3 id="e88">Songjiang: Approving the Widening of Streets <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Songyi is located at the intersection of Shanghai and Hangzhou, and land and water transportation can be reached in an instant. Since the opening of automobile traffic between Songjiang and Shanghai, people from all over have come to Songjiang to visit in an endless stream. The bridges in the city have gradually been rebuilt and are now passable. However, the roads are still extremely narrow, and cars cannot enter the streets, which is very inconvenient. There was a proposal to widen Changqiao Street, but it has not been implemented due to the difficulty in raising funds. County Magistrate Jin believes that road transportation is a key factor in the appearance of the city, and he believes that it is necessary to widen the streets. Based on the actual measurement of the city's street map by the Technical Office, it was submitted to yesterday's county government meeting for discussion. It was decided to appoint Public Security Bureau Chief Shen Jing, Education Bureau Chief Zhu Zhaosheng, District Chief Zhong Taishi of the First District, and Chief Li Zuhua of the Property Department to conduct a detailed review at the county government at 1:00 p.m. today (the 5th). They all agreed that the old streets in the city were less than three meters wide, and transportation was indeed inconvenient. Based on the map measured by the Technical Office, only the area within the city circle was considered. It was decided to stipulate the widening degree according to the needs of the situation. The main street was set at 12 meters, including the sidewalks, and the secondary ones were divided into 9 meters, 7 meters, and 4 meters. It was noted on the map where to start from which street, and how to raise the funds. The plan will be submitted to the meeting for approval and implementation.</p>

<p>At 4:00 p.m. on the (4th), a teenage boy wearing a dark blue striped serge suit, white serge pants, yellow leather shoes, and a bronze felt hat, carrying a white raincoat on his arm and a leather suitcase in his hand, a copy of the newspaper, and a guest registration card from the Garden Hotel, arrived at the hotel in a horse-drawn carriage. He asked the front desk to pay the carriage fare of four dimes. Then he opened room number 25. He wrote his name on the guest form as Yu Nengrong, a student, 21 years old, from Tianjin. He paid a room fee of three yuan. He then strolled around the garden for a week. At around 5:00 p.m., he ordered half a catty of Huadiao wine, a preserved egg, and a plate of shredded pork for solo drinking. After dinner, he went to bed at around 8:00 p.m. He told the bellboy to wake him up at 8:00 or 9:00 a.m. the next morning. At around 8:00 a.m. yesterday (the 5th), the bellboy opened the door to wake him up, seeing that the time had arrived. He was shocked to see the guest lying on the bed, barely breathing. There was vomit of food next to his head, and three empty bottles and an empty box of Great Britain cigarettes next to the bed, with traces resembling opium. Knowing that the guest had taken poison, he quickly reported to the front desk and sent Yu Nengrong to Suyong Hospital. Dr. Gu examined him and determined that he had swallowed too much opium and tranquilizer, and had delayed for too long. He gave him three injections of cardiac stimulant and gave him an enema. However, his throat was blocked and water could not enter. It was feared that he could not be saved.</p>

<p>Shen A’kui and Shen A’mao of Xinzizhen, Liudu, Shiqu of Wujiang County, owed Sun Senyu more than 50 shi of rent for more than ten years for more than seven mu of rented land. They returned the land last winter, but the rent was not paid in full. As a result, Sun Senyu filed a civil lawsuit in February, but the defendants ignored it and intensified their efforts. When the plaintiff hired workers to pump water to prepare for transplanting rice seedlings, they aggressively went to the field to prevent the plaintiff's workers from entering the field. Fearing that there would be trouble, they tried their best to avoid it. Unexpectedly, A’kui and others thought they could be bullied and planted the cultivated land without permission. Sun Senyu had no other choice but to file a criminal lawsuit again. Who knew that A’kui and others still ignored it, causing the case to be suspended for eight months without resolution. Therefore, A’kui and others regarded 霸租and rent arrears as their due right. They boasted to the tenants in the neighboring zhen that the government now does not protect the owners, and everyone can not pay the rent. Even if they are sued, it is nothing more than that. They hoped to mobilize the tenants to follow suit and support them. Those who heard it envied their benefits and were all excited. Therefore, there will inevitably be problems with the rents in the zhen now. However, the authorities have heard about it, and I don't know if they can eliminate the hidden dangers.</p>

One person was on the bow acting as a lookout, and two people entered the cabin to search and rob. All the goods on the boat and the passengers' silver were completely robbed. Yesterday (the 4th), the victim reported the case to the county government. The county government ordered the Hangyou Boat Association to instruct all Hangyou boats to prohibit sailing at night to avoid danger, as the Hangyou boats have been robbed repeatedly at night. At the same time, it also ordered the police to strictly arrest the robbers in this case and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Yu Fusong, a member of the Jiaxing Lengyan Temple-based County Security Regiment's cadre team, was a native of Chongde County, 25 years old. He was recommended by the Seventh District and enrolled in the regiment. Yu was usually taciturn and extremely disciplined, but he occasionally showed a lack of interest in life to the other members of the regiment, which no one paid attention to. The 4th was the ancient Mid-Autumn Festival. Yu bought cigarettes and distributed them to the other members of the regiment, and then bought food from the restaurant and ate a lot. At about 6:00 p.m., Yu replaced Wu Zhenji, who was on guard duty at the gate, and ordered Wu to have dinner. Unexpectedly, in less than five minutes, Yu shot himself with his gun, the bullet piercing his chest. Hengshan, a monk from the temple, heard the sound and came out to look. Yu had already fallen to the ground. The regiment immediately carried Yu to the Gospel Hospital for treatment, but he died due to his serious injuries. He was then carried back to the regiment. At 3:00 p.m. on the 5th, Wang Bangyan, the prosecutor of the local branch court, went to the Lengyan Temple team headquarters to examine the body.

<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen, accompanied by League of Nations expert Dr. Leith-Ross, went to Beijing to participate in the founding meeting of the National Economic Council. Because the Ministry of Finance urgently needed to discuss the issuance of 100 million yuan of new customs treasury bonds with the banking community in Shanghai, Song flew from Beijing to Shanghai by private plane at 8:30 yesterday morning, accompanied by Dr. Leith-Ross, Tang Hai'an, and Leith-Ross's secretary, Max, totaling four people. At 10:30 yesterday morning, they landed safely at the Hualong Airport. After disembarking, Song and his party took two cars. Song returned to his residence on Qiqi Road, while Leith-Ross and others returned to the Huamao Hotel to rest. Kong Xiangxi, the governor of the Central Bank, originally planned to fly back to Shanghai on the same plane as Song and his party yesterday morning, but because his wife, Ms. Song Ailing, had a slight cold in Beijing, he had to postpone his departure for a day or two. Regarding the issue of the 100 million yuan of new customs treasury bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance, it is rumored that Vice Minister Bu Lin and Director Xu Kan of the Monetary Department of the Ministry of Finance have separately contacted the banking community in Shanghai to mortgage 50 million yuan of the treasury bonds in advance to meet the urgent needs of current military and political expenses. It is said that the payment can be completed within one or two days. Yesterday, a reporter from the Xinxin News Agency specially asked Tang Shoumin, the general manager of the Jiaotong Bank, about everything. According to Tang, Finance Minister Song had not contacted the banking community after arriving in Shanghai today (i.e., yesterday). As for the rumor that 50 million yuan of the 100 million yuan of new customs treasury bonds will be mortgaged in advance, I have not heard of it so far, or it is based on a speculation.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education ordered the Peking Library in July to prepare for the reproduction of rare books to promote our country's inherent culture. The library immediately contacted major libraries and book collectors in the country, all of whom expressed their full support because it was a matter of promoting academics. The library and the Commercial Press drafted a contract. Now we have found the library's submission to the Ministry of Education with two sets of measures and thirteen articles of the contract, which are extremely important, so we transcribe them as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e105">Submission <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The director of the Peking Library submitted to the Ministry of Education, stating that the Ministry sent a letter on July 19th commissioning the library to be responsible for preparing for the printing of rare books. A plan was drafted and reported to the Ministry for record. The Ministry's intention to promote culture and benefit scholars is greatly appreciated. The library immediately repeatedly reviewed and protected the plan with public and private collectors and the Commercial Press, and drafted two sets of measures, which are now recorded on separate paper and submitted for review, along with a volume of the proposed catalog of Siku Rare Book Series (other existing catalogs and uncollected proposed catalogs will be submitted after compilation). A draft contract between the library and the Commercial Press is submitted for review and record, which is for the public convenience. Respectfully submitted to the Minister of Education, with one copy of the proposed catalog, one copy of the draft contract, and one copy of the measures. Cai Yuanpei, Director of the National Peking Library, Yuan Tongli, Deputy Director (September 25th)</p>
<h3 id="e106">Measures <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Two sets of measures are attached: (1) The books selected for the Rare Book Series are not limited to those recorded in the Siku Quanshu. Generally speaking, they can be divided into three categories: (A) Old carvings and old transcriptions that are better than the Siku editions; (B) Those that were not included when compiling the Siku Quanshu; (C) Those recorded in the Siku existing catalogs. The editions not found when compiling the Siku have been emerging one after another in the past few decades. In addition to the Peking Library and the National Studies Library, collectors at home and abroad, such as Qu Qijia of Changshu, Li Shengduo of Dehua, Chuan Zengxiang of Jiang'an, Liu Chenggan of Wuxing, Pan Mingxun of Panyu, and Mo Tianyi of Dongguan, are all worthy of being called outstanding for a generation. In addition, there are countless lost books from Dunhuang and Japan, which should be investigated separately and reproduced in the best condition. In addition, the books recorded in the Siku existing catalogs, as well as the Ming Shilu, and the banned books during the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, which were all discarded due to taboos when compiling the Siku, should also be published separately to supplement the omissions of the official history and satisfy the scholars' wishes. It is planned to first publish the books of category A, and then gradually extend to categories B and C, to show the Ministry's intention to promote culture. (2) The aim of reproducing the books is to circulate them. Each book should be sold at a low price as a separate edition after printing, and then combined into a series, so that each book is a separate book, so that poor scholars can easily purchase them, and the rare books can be widely spread, so as not to betray the Ministry's original intention of promoting academics and benefiting scholars.</p>

<p>Mr. Ariyoshi Akira is scheduled to go to the capital within days, and will travel via Peiping. According to what he knows, the Japanese ambassador's trip is purely for inspecting embassy affairs and socializing with the mission, and there are no special tasks, it is said. The New Voice News agency said that the news that Japan will use reciprocal tariffs as an exchange condition and is willing to automatically revoke consular jurisdiction in China has attracted the attention of those who are quite concerned about international issues.

The pawnshop industry raised objections to this. Recently, the Finance Committee of the Public Works Department considered the matter and the Finance Department proposed a revised method: fees would still be collected based on each shop's annual turnover. The calculation method would use the annual turnover for the twelve months up to the end of September as the standard for the following year's tax payment (January to December). Payments would still be collected in four quarterly installments. After discussion, one committee member stated that large pawnshops and small pawnshops operate completely differently and each has its own guild. For example, large pawnshops generally do not charge storage fees except for extremely large items, while small pawnshops charge storage and other fees even for small items like jewelry. It was then resolved that the Director of Finance should consult with the pawnshop guilds to reduce the current license fees to two per thousand of annual turnover for large pawnshops and four per thousand for small pawnshops, effective January 1, 1934. This proposal was approved by the Board of Directors on October 3 and will be implemented accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Two Groups Petition the Court to Severely Punish Unscrupulous Merchants in the Case of Japanese Yarn Passed off as Domestic Goods; Request that They Be Charged with Forgery of Official Documents and Fraud <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The Hua Dong News Agency reports that the sensational case of ten factories, including Gong Zu and Ding Xin, privately selling enemy goods, passing off Ren Zhong brand domestic yarn from Shen Xin No. 5 Factory, and forging tax invoices to deceive the tax authorities for shipping purposes, is scheduled for continued trial today. However, since Shen Xin and Gong Zu, Ding Xin, etc., have reached a settlement, today's hearing may be resolved immediately. Therefore, He Zicheng, Executive Committee Member of the Zhijiang Shipping Guild of Hangzhou, and Li Qiaozhi, Executive Committee Member of the United Associations of Various People's Groups in Shanghai, out of patriotic fervor, yesterday requested lawyer Zhang Juansheng to draft a petition to the First Special District Court, criminally charging the unscrupulous merchants Yu Xifan, Chen Zhongxian, Wang Liwei, Sun Xinzu, Yu Yuxin, Zhou Songmao, Chai Zhixiang, Zhao Bingnan, Wang Gengsheng, Guan Bingqing, etc., with the crimes of forging official documents and fraud, in order to prevent wrongdoing and uphold national law. The petition states: "Regarding the matter of using fraudulent methods and forging official documents to harm public and private interests, we request strict punishment according to law. The ten factories, including Gong Zu Sock Factory, used the tax certificate of the Da Kang Yarn Factory's 'Standing Horse' brand of Japanese merchants to forge it into Ren Zhong brand of Shen Xin and other five factories, and also forged the consolidated tax certificate of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Tax Bureau. This was discovered by the Tax Bureau, which notified Shen Xin No. 5 Factory. The factory then filed a private prosecution. Your court has already held a hearing and set a deadline for retrial. The aforementioned circumstances have been publicly tried and reported, causing widespread consternation. Since the September 18th Incident, when the violent Japanese invaded Northeast China, all our countrymen have hated the brutality and ferocity of the island nation, and without exception, have shared the same hatred and determination to save the country. We have unanimously boycotted enemy goods and adhered to passive resistance, hoping to stem the tide. At this time of national crisis and unrecovered territory, all compatriots should embrace the fervent spirit of boycotting Japanese goods. However, the unscrupulous merchants, Gong Zu Sock Factory and other ten factories, are so deranged and recklessly risked disgrace by daring to use the means of forging official documents to commit fraud in an attempt to gain illegal profits. Although only Shen Xin No. 1 Factory is directly harmed, those who are indirectly harmed without knowing it are deeply and greatly affected. Such corrupt, vile, and deceitful merchants who cheat the people of the country cause all those with blood to be outraged. We look forward to the national law punishing them. We deeply grieve the arrogance of the powerful enemy and worry for the country. We have held anti-Japanese posts in Shanghai and Hangzhou. We have no way to completely eliminate these unscrupulous merchants who cheat and seek profit in order to save the country and alleviate the difficulties. Now, fortunately, we have witnessed a large number of incorrigible unscrupulous merchants being uncovered, and their clearly criminal acts with conclusive evidence can be placed under national law and punished with appropriate penalties to deter wrongdoing and warn others. Recently, we have repeatedly read reports that Shen Xin No. 5 Factory has accepted a settlement regarding the damage caused by counterfeiting and is said to be completely withdrawing [the case]. We cannot help but feel great regret. If the outcome of the trial is as reported, it will not only encourage others to follow suit and open the door to counterfeiting and fraud but also disregard the credibility of national law. Out of patriotic fervor, how can we continue to tolerate such a situation and allow [these merchants] to go unpunished outside the law? Therefore, we specially request your court to separately detain the defendants for the forgery of official documents and fraud, and severely punish them according to law, in order to prevent wrongdoing and uphold national law for the benefit of both public and private interests. Respectfully submitted to the First Special District Court of Shanghai."</p>

<p>Xu Leqing, a broker at the Cotton Cloth Exchange, was walking from his residence at 167 Yu Yuan Road at 9:30 AM on September 1st to take a bus at the intersection of Haig Road and Jing'an Temple Road to go to the exchange for business. He was suddenly attacked by kidnappers. When the kidnapping attempt failed, he was shot and killed. The kidnappers fled in car number 6669. Subsequently, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui, detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Dong Zhaobin, etc., of the General Inspection Department successively arrested eight kidnappers, including Wu Youshan, Wu Ziqiu, Dong Zilian, and Gu Dakang, and seized two handguns. They were sent to the First Special District Court for repeated interrogations. Because Gu was suspected to be less involved, he was allowed to be released on a bail of 1,000 yuan. The others were remanded in custody. This has been reported in the newspaper. Now, Chief Detective You Agen and Detective Liu Junqing of the Lao Zha Police Station, etc., apprehended the main suspect, Wang Laojiu (i.e., Wang Jinlan, also known as Wang Xiaomei), from Shaoxing in room 59 of the</p>
<h3 id="e133">Champagne Hotel <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>on Yunnan Road on September 26. They also arrested Yao Zhifa (i.e., Little Monk) from Shaoxing at the intersection of Dalian Bay Road and Huade Road, and took them back to the police station. After investigation, it was found that Wang and Yao, in addition to the kidnapping and shooting of Xu Leqing, had also kidnapped Shen Jixiu, the owner of the Xiang Kang Wood Firm in Southern Guanqiao, for a large ransom at 10 PM on April 22 at the entrance of 93 Pingle Lane on Jiujiang Road, and had unsuccessfully kidnapped Xiang Shengwu, the son of Xiang Songmao, the former manager of the Wuzhou Pharmacy, at 270 Anarquin Road in the French Concession at 9 PM on January 23. Therefore, yesterday afternoon, the police station combined</p>
<h3 id="e134">Wang and Yao <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>into the Wu Youshan case and sent them to the Criminal Division 8 of the Special Court at the same time. Judge Wu Tingqi took the bench for continued interrogation. First, police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated the circumstances of the arrest of Wang and Yao, saying that the two defendants had confessed in detail at the police station that they were both present at the time of the kidnapping of Xu Leqing. Wu Ziqiao prepared the car and issued two handguns, one to Yao Zhifa and one to Zhang Ziping (nicknamed Bao Fa Ma Pi), who was still at large. Wang was on the lookout. Yao even shot Xu, killing him. However, when Yao boarded the car to escape, he tore the</p>
<h3 id="e135">Right Cuff <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>of his white long shirt on the iron hook on the car door due to panic. Afterwards, in order to conceal the evidence, he had the tear repaired and dyed black, and pawned it at a pawnshop on 346 Mintini Ying Road in the French Concession for 1.6 yuan. The police station has retrieved the original object from the pawnshop and investigated the car number 6669 used by the kidnappers, confirming that it was purchased by Wu Youshan. The check paid by Wu at the time has also been retrieved by the police station from Youbang Bank. After reviewing them, [the lawyer] requested they be returned. He then presented the</p>
<h3 id="e136">Check and Clothing <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>as evidence. Next, Western Detective Huai Tuo of the Lao Zha Police Station testified about the circumstances of the arrest of Wang and Yao and the investigation. Western Detective Ge Bobo of the General Inspection Department added that on the 29th of last month, the police station ordered all the witnesses in the case to re-identify [the suspects] at the police station. Constable No. 671 still pointed out the third defendant, Hua Zhengnan, and the thirteenth defendant, Yao Zhifa. Liu Ziren, a clerk at a wood shop on Beijing Road, told the police station that the furniture in the kidnappers' den at 84 Bi Xun Road was rented from him. The fifth defendant, Dong Zilian, seemed to be the one who rented the furniture, but he could not be sure. When questioned, the defendant Yao Zhifa confessed that the retrieved black clothing was indeed his. The court then ordered Yao to put it on, and the</p>
<h3 id="e137">Size and Length <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>were perfect. Yao also confessed that the shirt was originally white, but because the right cuff was torn by a car at Jing'an Temple at 9:00 AM on the day of the incident, he had it repaired and dyed black, and pawned it for 1.5 yuan to spend. However, the instigator of this case was actually Wu Ziqiu. Because I lived in Room 21 of the Tiansheng Hotel in the concession, Wang Laojiu came to me beforehand to discuss and ask me to help, and instructed me to wait at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Avenue Foch on September 1. A car would arrive. When the time came, I waited there. Before long, a car arrived with only Bao Fa Ma Pi Zhang Ziping inside. He gave me a handgun, and Zhang also held one. The car drove to the front of the Jing'an Temple Post Office and we got out. Zhang ordered me to stand there and not to do anything but to follow his instructions. Zhang went forward. Before long, I saw Zhang try to drag Xu Leqing into the car. Xu fell to the ground and refused. Seeing the urgency, Zhang asked me to come forward to help, but Xu still refused to get up. Zhang then ordered me to shoot, and I fired a shot.</p>
<h3 id="e138">The Bullet Hit His Waist <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>At that time, my gun was jammed by the bullet and could not continue to fire. I quickly boarded the car with Zhang, me on the right and Zhang on the left, and the driver sped away. Confessing to this point, the court then had Yao identify the two seized handguns and which gun he fired. Yao immediately identified the handgun numbered 219894. At this point, police lawyer Wang Yaotang also stated that after the police station seized the handgun, it was sent to the Identification Office for inspection, which confirmed that the gun was the one that killed Xu Leqing and that the gun was indeed damaged. Yao Zhifa then continued, "Zhang and I returned to the Tiansheng Hotel in the car. At 12:00 noon, Wang Laojiu came and asked me how things went. I answered him that</p>
<h3 id="e139">The Person Had Been Knocked Down <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>I also asked Wang where he was at the time. Wang replied that he was on the west side of the scene. Everything I have said above is the actual truth and there are no falsehoods. I did not see Wu Youshan, Hua Gongnan, etc." When questioned, Wang Laojiu confessed, "My father, Wang Zhaoxiang, is friends with Wu Ziqiu, so I often went to Wu's house at 7 Xiude Lane on Avenue Eugène Péreire to play. I did not know at first that Wu was kidnapping. As for Yao Zhifa, he was a colleague in the 5th Regiment of the Zhejiang Provincial Security Team, so we knew each other. Five or six days before the incident, I went to Wu's house. Wu asked me if I wanted to do a kidnapping case and if I would go with him. I said no. Wu then asked me if the monk (i.e., Yao Zhifa) was in Shanghai and asked me to find him (Zhang Ziping and a Tang person were also present at Wu's house). If I found him, I could tell him to meet Zhang at the intersection of Route Muro and Avenue Foch that morning. I then went to the Tiansheng Hotel to meet Yao and told him what Wu said. On September 1, Wu ordered me to go to Jing'an Temple Road to</p>
<h3 id="e140">Observe the Situation <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>to see if it was successful and report back. I dared not disobey, so I went there and saw Zhang and Yao take action. Afterwards, I heard a gunshot, so I turned back and reported to Wu. I don't know anything else." Wu Ziqiu also confessed, "I have heard what Wang Laojiu and others have said. Please don't ask me any more questions and just punish me according to law. But the actual matter was handled by Zhang Ziping through Wang Laojiu, and we talked on the veranda in my house. On September 1, I did send Wang Laojiu to Jing'an Temple to check if there was any danger, but I did not go. Wu Youshan and Hua Zhengnan did not know about it. Although Wu Youshan paid for a car on my behalf, he did not know it was for kidnapping. Both handguns belong to me." Constable No. 271 testified that he saw the defendant Hua Zhengnan</p>
<h3 id="e141">Definitely at the Scene <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>without any doubt. He could not be sure about Yao Zhifa. Hua Zhengnan vehemently denied it, saying that he was a waiter in the Far East Silver Company on the upper floor of the Hong Kong National Bank on Jiangxi Road and could not leave his post at will, fearing that the constable had mistaken him. A Russian ticket collector from the Public Omnibus Company, A-qu-ge-shi, testified that he only saw a kidnapper wearing a suit, black glasses, and a felt hat, whose cheeks resembled the defendant Wu Youshan. He could not be sure whether Yao Zhifa was present. At this point, the defendants Yao Zhifa and Wang Laojiu both stated that the person wearing a suit was actually Zhang Ziping, who had glasses, a round face with pockmarks, and a rather tall figure, taller than Wu Youshan. Since it was already 5:30 PM, there was no time to continue the interrogation. Defendant Dong Zilian's lawyer, Ye Fokan, requested that Dong be allowed to be released on bail. Judge Wu ordered that the case be adjourned to the afternoon of the 17th for further interrogation. Dong was allowed to be released on bail of 5,000 yuan, Gu remained on his original bail, and the others were remanded in custody. The court then adjourned.</p>

<p>—Strange Name Cards and Addresses of Important People Found on His Person—</p>
<p>Liu Shuiling, a native of Pudong, 31 years old, was a leather wallet worker at the Xinhau Leather Factory owned by the Chai brothers, Xinpu and Shunpu, from Ningbo in Furun Lane, Nanshi, Jiujiudi. Liu took advantage of the Mid-Autumn Festival holiday the day before yesterday to visit a friend at Xiaonanmen in the evening. At 10:30 PM that night, he mistakenly took the newly established No. 2 loop tram at 543 Nanyang Bridge Tram Station on Yuan Road, passing through the Old West Gate Station. He failed to transfer to the No. 3 loop tram, which led to a dispute when the ticket inspector discovered it. Liu was detained at the Second District General Station. After District Chief Li questioned him, his answers were vague. At the same time, four red-bottomed, gold-lettered name cards were found on his person, printed with [Jiang Jieyan] [Ge Gang] with the inscription "Jiangsu Province, Songjiang Prefecture, Nanhui County, Liuzao Township." Two of them had red name chops. There were also two red paper, gold letter cards printed with [Your Excellency Jieshi], [Jiang Ge Gang], [Jieyan] "Jiangsu Nanhui Heaven-Sent Zhuangyuan, Seven-Province Inspector Censor." On the back were white printed characters meaning "Zhuangyuan and Younger Brother". A total of five strange name cards were found, which contained the addresses of important Party-state figures, such as: (1) [Zhongzheng, 1543 Maojia Lane, Zhongshan East Road, Nanjing; Lishi Society, Central Park, Nanjing; 3655 Gangshan Hot Springs Road, South Gate, Nanjing; 1367 Lane 147, Wutong Village, Zhajiayuan, Hangzhou], (2) [Feng Yuxiang, Zi Huanzhang, Taian County, Shandong; Yongping and others in Mount Tai], (3) [Yan Xishan, Zi Bochuan, 167 Duck Village in Taiyuan City, Shanxi], (4) [Chen Mingshu, 75 Shanzhong Road, French Concession, near Haig Road]. The strange cards were presented as evidence. At the same time, Liu made absurd claims, saying that he had recognized Soong Mei-ling as his stepmother in June of the 19th year of the Republic of China, met her at the Popular Cinema in Nanshi, and was introduced in a dream by Nantze Lu Bohong. District Chief Li, seeing that his words were incoherent, ordered him to be temporarily detained for investigation. It was also learned that in November of last year, Liu had also been found with similar strange cards in Nanjing by the Capital Public Security Bureau. They had ordered the provincial government to instruct the Water Police Team to go to Liuzao Township, Nanhui, for investigation. However, there had been no incidents of external fraud, proving that he suffered from mental illness, and he was released.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Villains Stop at Nothing: Defrauding Even Brothel Keepers, Kidnapping Prostitutes, Violating Their Bodies, and Daring to Publicly Demand Ransom <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Recently, a type of villain has emerged who, knowing that prostitution is illegal, exploits this weakness by targeting privately run brothels, intimidating and defrauding them. They even forcibly kidnap prostitutes for ransom. After these brothel keepers have their money-making trees kidnapped, they are well aware that they themselves are violating the law, so they mostly dare not publicize it and silently prepare the funds to redeem them. This has emboldened the bandits, and this disguised form of kidnapping has become increasingly prevalent. Another case occurred the day before yesterday. The victim was Wang Aihua, a prostitute in the Zhi Ji Court at 7 Dingyu Lane, Zhifu Road. The prostitute Wang was only 19 years old and originally from Shaoxing. At 7:00 AM the previous morning, she was still asleep when several people suddenly broke into the brothel. Among them, a man from Wuxi named Hui Baoquan went alone into the inner room and woke Wang, saying, "Come with me to the guildhall," forcing her to put on her clothes. The prostitute was terrified and didn't know what to do, and was unable to resist. She was arranged to be carried out of the brothel by the group of villains. First, she was hidden in room 103 of the Tianjin Road Ning Shang Hotel. Then, fearing that the location was inappropriate, they moved her to room 12 of the Tibet Road Xizang Hotel. After they arrived, Hui Baoquan forced the prostitute to have sexual relations with him. After the affair, Hui ordered his accomplices Wang Zulin and Kang Xinqiang to watch over Wang while he sent Xu A'gen to notify the brothel to pay the ransom. Wang Xiaomao, the brothel keeper of the area, came out to negotiate. Xu demanded a huge ransom, but then reduced it to ten yuan, but the prostitute Wang only agreed to ten yuan. As a result, Xu guided the prostitute to discuss with Aihua. On the way, Wang Xiaomao suddenly said to Xu, "I will sue the constables." Xu was horrified and quickly ran away. Xiaomao screamed. Yang Yongfu happened to be passing by and helped to subdue Xu. He was handed over to constables Nos. 211 and 238 and taken to the police station. According to Xu, his accomplices were hiding in room 321 of the New World Hotel. The police chief sent detectives Shen Jinwen and Qiu Sijiu to arrest Shen Sibao, Yang Guoxiang, Lu Yikun, Xiao Guifang, Zheng Linlin, Jiang Heshang, and six others. They then went to the Xi Yin Hotel, where Hui Baoquan and Wang Xianglin were still lying in bed with the prostitute, and Kang Xinqiang was sleeping alone. They were all arrested together. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Feng Shide interrogated them. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu explained the case, saying that the defendants were mostly recidivists and requested a postponement for investigation. He also requested that the two prostitutes come to court to testify about their violent experiences. Judge Feng questioned the defendants and ordered them to be remanded in custody for further interrogation.</p>

<p>The wife was six months pregnant, the police said the killing was cruel and ruthless.</p>
<p>Xi Shengcheng (aka Ji Gucheng), a 42-year-old man from Funing living in a flat on Zhoushan Road, was a rickshaw puller by profession, and was of a violent disposition. He married Ms. Gu, 34 years old, who came from Yangzhou, and they had a daughter named Xiaomao, 15 years old. Recently, due to poverty and inability to support his wife and daughter, there were frequent quarrels between the couple. In mid-April, Ms. Gu and Mr. Xi agreed to divorce and marry Liu Yuqing, a fellow villager, for 120 yuan. A contract was drawn up and a public announcement was made in the newspaper. Later, Mr. Xi was distressed and once tried to bring his wife back home unsuccessfully. He was humiliated and angered. Ms. Gu was recently working at the Gongqi Cigarette Factory on Pingliang Road. At 6:40 AM on the morning of the 28th of last month, Mr. Ji purchased a sharp knife and waited near the factory. As Ms. Gu walked out of her home on Dalianwan Road to go to work, she was stopped by Mr. Ji. Without asking questions, he stabbed</p>

<p>Afterwards, he attempted to escape, but was captured by Liu Xiaolin, a road foreman from Yancheng. He was handed over to Constable No. 1205 and Detective Huang Fugen of the Huishan Police Station, along with the murder weapon, and detained at the Huishan Police Station. The injured woman was sent to the hospital for treatment, but died due to her injuries. The prosecutor went to the scene to examine the body. The next morning, Mr. Ji was sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation of the details. He was ordered to summon witnesses for further verification. This has been reported in the newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Fenfen continued the trial in Criminal Court 3. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated, "The previous defendant's claim that the murder weapon was a knife he recently used when selling pears as a peddler is untrue. During the postponement, detectives went to his home to search and found no</p>
<h3 id="e148">Pear-Selling Baskets <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>or other items. The knife was recently purchased and intended to kill his wife. The police are now prosecuting him for premeditated murder under Article 284, Paragraph 1, Item 2 of the Criminal Law. The fortuneteller who wrote the divorce contract and the defendant's daughter, Xiaomao, are now in court." Wang Jiyu, an elderly fortuneteller from Gaoyou, testified, "At that time, the defendant, the deceased Ms. Gu, and another old man were present. After I finished writing, I was paid one yuan. The defendant's fingerprint on the contract was applied later. I did not see the 120 yuan deposited." Xiaomao, the defendant's daughter, said, "My mother (i.e., the deceased) left home on the evening of April 17. I do not know anything about the divorce or remarriage to Liu Yuqing. However, Liu often came to our house beforehand and took my mother out. I do not know where my mother was staying. My father used to pull a rickshaw. I recently heard that he was selling pears because</p>

<p>I live with my aunt." Ms. Wu, Ms. Gu’s relative, testified: “Gu's husband, Baogui, used to work on a wharf in Nanjing. The divorced and remarried affairs, and has no familiarity with Liu Yuqing, The couple's divorce is unknown to me, but Liu often calls Mother went out, but I didn’t know where she was staying." The defendant insisted, "The fingerprint on the divorce certificate was placed by two men holding my hand against my will. I was not selling pears, and had no basket. I was just selling the pears when I met her. She refused to go home and because of anger, the first knife</p>

<p>The Public Works Department Music Committee, at its meeting last month, decided that this year's Sunday symphony concerts will be performed at the Grand Theater starting on October 8. Regarding ticket prices, it is proposed to follow the common practice of various theaters and provide a 60 cent option to attract a larger audience and make full use of the theater's seats. This matter was submitted to the Board of Directors on October 3 and was approved by the Board. The ticket prices are set at 1.5 and 2 yuan for the upstairs, and 60 cents and 1 yuan for the downstairs. The detailed arrangements will be planned and implemented by the Music Team Leader.</p>

<p>Because he seized the knife, the second thrust was into the abdomen, a total of two knife wounds, which is the truth. The court asked you at the autopsy site to admit there was only the murder weapon and no such items as a fresh pear basket. The reply was that the previous statement was forgotten and the rest of the testimony was evasive. The court ordered the start of the debate. The police lawyer said that the defendant premeditated the murder, which is very clear. His admission that the divorce fingerprint was forced is also nonsense. In short, at first he agreed to the separation, and then he saw Liu Ren living together in pairs, which was really hard to bear. He regretted it too late. He also saw that the woman's abdomen was bulging and knew she was pregnant. It was found that the woman was six months pregnant, so he first killed the mother and then killed the child. The means were extremely cruel. He should be given a severe sentence, etc. Judge Xiao instructed the lawyer to defend the defendant once and ordered him to be remanded in custody pending a scheduled sentence.</p>

<p>Wang Gang, a fourth-class police officer of the Yinhang Branch of the Seventh District of the Jiangwan District Public Security Bureau, was 25 years old, from Hebei Province, and had only been a police officer for three months. However, this person was usually very haggard, with a sad face, and secretly shed tears. Therefore, colleagues often asked about the reason, but he refused to reveal it, only saying that his home was broken and it was difficult to reunite. He thought that it was due to foreign aggression and domestic worries that his home could not be completely reunited, and he was allowing everyone to go their own way. On the 4th of this month, the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the old lunar calendar, the beautiful scenery and good festival made him even more homesick. Therefore, Wang was heartbroken. At 12:00 noon, after his shift at the gate, he took the rifle he was carrying to the toilet, aimed it at his head, and fired with a loud bang, falling to the ground and dying. Someone heard the sound and went to inspect, and found that Wang had already died. The bullet entered from the left eyelid and exited from the back of the head. He was already dead. They reported it to the chief of the office and reported it to the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday, they transferred and ordered third-class police officer Han Yaowang to report to the local court for an autopsy. After the commissioner Prosecutor Li and the autopsy officer arrived at the scene to examine and clarify, it was determined to be suicide, and an order was issued to collect the body.</p>
<h3 id="e153">Shen Yangchun - Missing After Being Kidnapped - Kidnapper Gu Junshan Interrogated Yesterday - Gu Junshan Said He Was a Wang Detective's Orderly - Investigation by the French Concession Police Found No Such Person <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>—The Court Must Summon Plaintiff Zhao Liansheng for Further Interrogation—</p>
<p>Zhao Liansheng, a Ningbo native residing at No. 10 Bubergh Lane, at the intersection of Rue Lubin and Route Bubergh in the French Concession, is known by everyone as Xiao Liansheng. On the morning of the 17th of last month, at about 8:00 AM, he left his residence with his wife, Cao, and a fellow villager, Shen Yangchun (a jockey at the Race Club, living at No. 4 Tongan Lane, Chenjia Lane, in the Chinese district). The three went out, first to the residence of a friend surnamed Jia in Sande Lane across the street to pay their respects after a death. On their way back, when they arrived at the intersection of Route Bubergh and Rue Lubin, intending to board their private car No. 6996 parked there, they were suddenly attacked by several thugs with guns, who tried to kidnap them. Zhao, fortunately alert, quickly ran away and escaped danger. The bandits immediately dragged Zhao's friend Shen Yangchun into the car and ordered the driver, Chu Youwen, to drive away. The person and the car were kidnapped and have not been found since. At that time, Chinese and Vietnamese patrol officers No. 101 and 111 patrolling nearby heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, capturing a bandit named Gu Junshan from Jiangbei, and escorted him to the Second Special District Local Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been recorded in previous reports. The police investigation of this case has been completed. At 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Li Changnian continued the trial in the First Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer Yuan Huang stated the police investigation process, saying that according to the defendant Gu Junshan's confession, he is currently serving as an orderly at Commander Wang's place in the Headquarters. He came to Shanghai with Wang on the 8th of last month and resided in the Longhua Gendarmerie Camp. On the 16th, he was ordered by Wang to go to the intersection of Route Bubergh in the French Concession at 8:00 AM the next morning with his colleague Wang Junsheng and others to arrest a Communist leader. Someone else was waiting there to point them out. When they set off, Wang issued each of them a live ammunition pistol in the office of the military camp, etc. The police investigation of the Wang Detective confessed by the defendant seems to be dedicated to arresting Communists. The police sent personnel to the Longhua Headquarters to investigate, but there was no such person as Wang Detective, and the people in the Headquarters did not know the defendant's name. Therefore, the police are now prosecuting the defendant for the first article and first clause of the Provisional Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits and the two crimes of conspiracy to kidnap and attempted murder by assembling a crowd under Article 284, Paragraph 1, Clause 1 and Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, requesting a trial in accordance with the law, etc., and submitting the pistol seized from the defendant and nine special bullets to the court. The plaintiff Zhao Liansheng did not arrive. A lawyer representing him stated that Zhao suffered excessive stimulation at the time of the incident and has now left Shanghai to recuperate in Mogan Mountain, Qingdao, etc., so our lawyer is here to present the statement, etc. Then Shen Sun, the wife of the victim Shen Yangchun, and Chu Jin, the wife of the driver Chu Youwen, arrived at the court, complaining that their husbands had been kidnapped and there was no news of them. They requested a strict investigation into the whereabouts of their husbands. The defendant Gu Junshan, 27 years old, from Funing, confessed that he came to Shanghai in December of last year, lived near Longhua with a person surnamed Zhou, pulling a rickshaw for a living. At the beginning of April of this year, he joined the army in the Sixth Platoon, Third Company, First Battalion, Eighty-Eighth Division in Longhua. After a month, he went to Nanjing and stayed for about two months. His fellow villager Zhou Jinsheng recommended him to work as an orderly at Wang Detective's place, with a monthly salary of 16 yuan. After a few days of work, he followed Wang and nine colleagues to Yangzhou for about half a month, where they arrested a Communist. Zhou and another colleague escorted him to Beijing. He and Wang and others returned to Shanghai, eight people in total, and stayed in the Longhua Gendarmerie Camp. Wang lived in a bungalow next to a tea house across from the barracks. On the evening of September 16, at 7:00 PM, Wang called him and his colleague Wang Junsheng to the office and said to them, "Tomorrow morning at 8:00 AM, you two go to the intersection of Route Bubergh and Rue Lubin to arrest a Communist leader." He replied that he did not know him and how could he arrest him. Wang said that another detective familiar with Wang Junsheng would be waiting there to point them out. The next morning, Wang issued each of them a live ammunition pistol in the office and they took a car to the intersection of Rue Lubin and Route Delfosse, got out of the car, and walked to the intersection of Route Bubergh. At about 8:00 AM, Wang Junsheng pointed at a person and said, "That's him." The detective ordered me to wait in the northeast corner. Not long after, I saw two men, a woman, and a child walking out of Bubergh Lane. Wang Junsheng waved to me to help him capture them. One of the two men was the Communist leader that the detective said he was. Just as I was about to step forward, I don't know why Wang Junsheng suddenly fired two shots and captured one person into the car and drove away. When I heard the gunshots, I ran east along Route Bubergh and was arrested by the patrol police. I don't know what happened afterwards. If we could have captured the Communist and not been arrested by the police, we would have escorted him to Wang Detective's place in Longhua, etc. At this point in the interrogation, the court, because the plaintiff Zhao Liansheng had not arrived, announced a postponement and ordered the plaintiff to be summoned for further interrogation. The defendant was still remanded in custody.</p>

<p>Car to……Babao</p>
<p>Train to……Haining</p>
<p>Babao The time flies quickly, and it's time to watch the tide again. However, most people only know to gather in Haining, and few know to go to Babao to watch the tide. Babao is more than ten miles east of Haining, and it is indeed an excellent place to watch the tide. Twenty miles east of Babao, the riverbank suddenly becomes towering, and the raging waves rush in and are suddenly counterattacked, dividing into two. The one that is blocked is called the East Tide, and the one that is not blocked is called the South Tide. The two tides surge westward and converge at Babao, then swirl and surge, forming a curved shape before rushing to Haining. Therefore, the tide of Haining is actually the tail of Babao. The China Travel Service, in view of this, has specially organized a Babao Tide Watching Tour this year, and the company has set up a very comfortable enclosure on the seawall there. Take a car from Shanghai along the Haihang Highway directly to Babao. There will be special cars for three days, and you can return to Shanghai that night. It was originally scheduled to start yesterday (5th), but because it happened to be the day after the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the old lunar calendar, people from all walks of life were busy with affairs, so they asked the company to postpone it until today. Yesterday, many people booked tickets, and the continuous driving will continue until Sunday.</p>
<p>Haining The Haining Tide Watching Special Train of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration is scheduled to start today. It departs from Shanghai North Station. After the car arrives at Xieqiao, it will be transferred to a civilian boat and towed by a ship. A viewing platform will be built next to the Haining seawall, and you can return to Shanghai on the same day. On the 6th, it will depart from Shanghai at 6:50 AM, on the 7th, it will depart from Shanghai at 7:10 AM, and on the 8th, it will depart from Shanghai at 7:45 AM. According to those who are familiar with the Haining tide, this year's tide will be large, especially when the weather is cloudy and rainy. On the 6th, the tide will rise at 12:40 PM, on the 7th, the tide will rise at 1:00 PM, and on the 8th, the tide will rise at 1:30 PM.</p>

<p>According to the spokesperson of the Railway Bureau yesterday, recently, passengers on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo line have been disembarking at the North Station with the return portion of round-trip tickets departing from Shangnan Station, which is not in line with the railway regulations.

<h3 id="e156">The Municipal Bureau of Public Works Sets a Deadline for Filling-in Registration - This Month, the 20th <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Various construction projects in the city center of this city are progressing daily. In addition to devoting its full efforts to the construction of roads, ditches, bridges, etc. in the area, the Municipal Bureau of Public Works believes that land adjacent to roads cannot be constructed without filling in soil. After drafting measures for filling in soil on behalf of the users, it was submitted to the municipal government for approval and implementation. It is now learned that since the implementation of these measures, many industry users have gone to the Bureau of Public Works to register. As of recently, the amount of soil required to be filled in by the registered users has been no less than 100,000 cubic meters. The bureau is now planning to invite tenders to start construction. However, because the scope of the project is determined after the bidding, it will be difficult to request filling in soil again during construction. Therefore, it has been decided to end registration on the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>—Wonderful Programs Are Countless—</p>
<p>The Haijingbo Grand Circus, which will open tomorrow, has many world-renowned technicians. It is said that the famous Ma Saishi has also come this time. He can enter the cages of ferocious beasts and engage in various amazing fights with fourteen Bengal tigers. Finally, he carries a roaring tiger out of the arena. There is also the great artist Bai Tuolai, who can perform various amazing skills with sixteen saddled strange horses. In addition, there is the Kaxue family of nine, who will perform slippery-backed horse riding and two very funny clown scenes. There are also the world's smallest and most refined strange man, Pomi, and the Mashah who leads tigers and elephants to perform together, and the equestrian Wutusi Tan. Finally, Haijingbo personally leads fourteen well-trained Shetland ponies to perform various amusing performances. The above strange performances are divided into sixteen acts and performed once in two hours. Tomorrow is the opening day, with only evening performances. Admission tickets can be purchased at the Moteli Foreign Company at prices ranging from six corners to five yuan. What is most satisfying about the troupe is that each act can be performed continuously without interruption, which eliminates the disadvantage of causing boredom.</p>

<p>There is now a whale that is 55 feet long and weighs 6 tons. This fish was seen by us in the movie "Moby Dick," starring John Barrymore, and was captured when filming the movie. It is now on display in the open space between the Great World and the Nanjing Grand Theater. The fish has been exhibited in New York and other places, causing a sensation for a time, with everyone rushing to see it. It is easy to see tigers, leopards, lions, and elephants, but it is a rare opportunity to see the true face of a whale with your own eyes. Since the exhibition in this port, the audience has also been very enthusiastic, praising it as a way to increase knowledge, which is of great educational significance. Admission is only five dimes, in order to compensate for the huge transportation costs of bringing the fish to Shanghai. It is also heard that from tomorrow, the Wing On Company will give away tickets to visit the Great Whale.</p>

<h3 id="e159">The Electric Power Labor Strike Interrogated Yesterday - Foremen and Temporary Workers Joined the Work Slowdown <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>The Dagong News Agency reported that the Shanghai Electric Power Company labor strike had the following news yesterday:</p>
<h3 id="e160">Foremen Left the Factory Yesterday Morning <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Since the workers of both the new and old factories declared a total work slowdown and were refused entry to the factory by the factory, the foremen of the new factory also left the factory voluntarily. Yesterday, all fifty foremen and one hundred temporary workers, according to the decision of the foremen's meeting the day before, joined the work slowdown, so the Chinese workers of the Electric Power Company, except for the power generation workers, have completely slowed down, and the situation is becoming more serious.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Strict Order to Maintain Power Generation <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Labor Union yesterday ordered the Fourth District Water and Electricity Labor Union, saying, "In order to comply with the order, since all members of the union have been slowing down due to the unreasonable oppression of the Electric Power Company, they are still considerate of social tranquility and maintain power generation, which is commendable. Recently, the union reported that three shifts of workers (i.e., power generation workers) have repeatedly requested to leave the factory and join the work slowdown, and the union has been unable to stop them. The power generation workers have been suffering deeply and have decided to take unified action. However, once the power is cut off, the society will inevitably suffer a huge panic. If this leads to other changes, although it is caused by the company's oppression, it will have too great an impact on the local area. In addition to already telegraphing the central and municipal party and government authorities to quickly find a way to deal with and resolve the matter as soon as possible, we hereby strictly order the union to immediately relay to the power generation workers to explain the greater good, and not to stop power generation unless absolutely necessary, in order to maintain social order, which is of utmost importance. This order is urgent."</p>
<h3 id="e162">Company Notice to Employees <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Electric Power Company printed a notice to employees, which was distributed to various employees yesterday. The following is an excerpt of the translation: "Regarding the recent labor dispute at the new and old factories, the news in the Shanghai newspapers said that the Public Works Bureau previously stipulated a 5% pension, which was quite favorable, but now it is thought to be 1% or 2%, which is not accurate. The pension stipulated by the former Public Works Bureau required 20 years of service to be eligible for payment. The current revision by the company stipulates that 15 years or less is eligible for payment, so the method is more favorable than before. However, those who are entrusted with passing or dismissed for cause are not subject to this rule. The three workers who were recently dismissed all committed offenses, and the workers unreasonably requested payment of pensions. The company is unable to accept it. Therefore, the company is not affected by the workers' strike. It is actually the workers who are cutting themselves off from the company. It is hoped that all employees will make a fair judgment and not take any action." Signed, Vice Chairman and Manager Shelt, October 5, 1933.</p>
<h3 id="e163">The Attitude of the Employees <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>After the company issued the notice to employees, the Dagong News Agency reporter, in order to understand the attitude of the employees, specially visited the person in charge of the Employees' Union, who said, "Today, the employees have received the company's written letter, the content of which is completely disguised, in an attempt to anesthetize people's hearts. Although the 5% pension stipulated by the former Public Works Bureau required 20 years of service to be eligible for payment, the bureau did not easily dismiss employees, and the other benefits were extremely generous. Nowadays, the company dismisses workers at every turn and uses the excuse of having made mistakes to evade pensions. The treatment of Chinese employees has not only not improved, but has lowered the salary increase measures and successively laid off employees of the Electricity and Gas Department, and recruited new employees with lower salaries. After repeated negotiations, they have ignored them. Recently, five people who have been serving for a long time, Wang Guoxin, Wu Zengyu, Gao Zixin, Zhu Xingsan, and Zhang Xusheng, have been dismissed for no reason. The meter readers requested the company to issue coats and uniforms because of the cold winter, but they have not been allowed. The harsh treatment is evident. Therefore, the situation of the employees being forced is no different from that of the two. The employees are very sympathetic to the workers' declaration of a work slowdown and will not be confused by the company's one-sided notice."</p>

<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng was injured in the waist when his car crashed into a roadside power pole. Although he was treated by Dr. Bumei, he still felt pain in his waist yesterday. Therefore, he did not go to the city government to work yesterday. Li Ting'an, the director of the Municipal Health Bureau, also went to the city government's guest house yesterday morning to visit Mayor Wu and provide medical treatment.</p>

<p>Many batches of South American Argentine wheat have arrived in Shanghai. Now, another 8,600 tons of wheat loaded from the port of Buenos Aires in that country have arrived in Shanghai. The ship is managed by the British merchant Tianxiang Foreign Company, and the wheat is handled by Defu Foreign Company. The wheat was ordered by Chinese flour mills.</p>

<p>Chongming suffered extremely severe damage in the two typhoons. The Chinese and Foreign Relief Society has organized a temporary office on the spot and has sent two commissioners, Chai and Zheng, to carry out emergency relief. It is heard that the Chengtiansi steamboat has assisted twice, transporting 1,657 bags of white rice, broken rice, and corn free of charge. They have been distributed as follows: 60 bags of corn and 75 bags of broken rice in the first district, 44 bags of corn and 55 bags of broken rice in the second district, 116 bags of corn and 145 bags of broken rice in the third district, 67 bags of corn and 50 bags of broken rice in the fourth district, 200 bags of corn and 275 bags of broken rice in the fifth district, 12 bags of corn and 15 bags of broken rice in the sixth district, and 108 bags of corn and 135 bags of broken rice in the seventh district. However, the broken rice is broken from the best white rice, and the quality is the best and the nutritional value is rich. It is a pity that there is too little rice and too many victims. A drop in the bucket cannot save the situation. It is hoped that all sectors will provide continuous assistance in order to popularize it and avoid regret.</p>

<p>The western Ningjiang District of Yinxian County, with its overlapping mountains, is the place where the mountains and rivers of Siming Mountain converge. In 1921 and 1922, two floods relied entirely on the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Association to raise funds for relief. This time, after two typhoons passed, the disaster was extremely severe. Many bridges and roads were washed away, and the dikes and waterways were silted up. Land and water transportation were cut off, and the residents were extremely anxious, repeatedly telegraphing Shanghai for assistance. After summoning a meeting with fellow villagers from Shanghai, the deputies Xu Yongyan, Tong Binwei, Zhuang Honggao, and more than 30 others, resolved to organize the Ningjiang Flood Relief Association, and nominated Mr. Zhang Shenzhi as the director, and Mr. Xu Yongyan and Mr. Zhuang Honggao as the deputy directors. It was reported to the Yinxian County Government for record, and it was requested that the monthly donation for road repairs from the rickshaw industry in Ningjiang be fully allocated to provide financial assistance.</p>

<p>The Great Beauty Evening News reported that Zhao Kong, the monk (i.e., Lincoln), today (5th) vehemently denied the claim that a secret meeting of the Anti-War Congress was held at his home at No. 131, Route Daixi. He said that after the Anti-War Congress's committee first discussed sponsorship, he refused and has not had any relationship with the congress since then. Lord Marley's secretary, Hamilton, once said that he could not deny that a meeting was held at Zhao Kong's home, but at the same time, he refused to believe this statement slightly. Hamilton's move was probably because he did not attend in person or did not know the location of the meeting. If his intention is misunderstood, it would be a big mistake to regard it as holding a meeting in his home.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Judges Should Respect Human Rights - Defendants Should Not Be Arbitrarily Detained - The Ministry of Justice Ordered All Provincial High Courts to Comply Yesterday <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Justice believes that various courts often arbitrarily order bail for defendants who should not be detained, and the accompanying bailiffs take the opportunity to demand and make things difficult. Yesterday, it specially instructed the presidents and chief prosecutors of the high courts of all provinces to comply with the following: in the future, defendants should not be ordered to post bail unless there are special circumstances, and judges must not have the intention of evading responsibility and forgetting the way of human rights. The reporter of the Daily News learned that the original order was as follows: "The case of untried detainees is related to the security of conduct. The National Government has previously issued a clear order, and this Ministry has already issued a circular to comply with it. The so-called bail is a guarantee under the Criminal Procedure Law. Permitting bail and suspending detention should be ordered to pay a security deposit in accordance with the law. However, the amount of the security deposit must be considered carefully and a reasonable amount must be determined. It must not be excessive. It should be allowed to be replaced by valuable securities or a guarantee in accordance with the law. If the relevant valuable securities are submitted, or a guarantee is issued by a person or business with considerable financial resources, it should be approved. According to the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, detainees may also be entrusted to their relatives or other appropriate persons without ordering bail, and they may only restrict their residence and suspend detention. Although this order only mentions bail, in the case of untried detainees, the intention of the National Government to sympathize with ordinary prisoners should be fully understood, and it should be handled in a practical manner, without waiting to be said. The measures for suspending detention stipulated by law should be strictly followed, and the implementation of detention for criminal defendants must be carried out with caution. Detention must not be arbitrarily carried out unless there are the circumstances stipulated in Articles 41 to 43 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and it is considered necessary. This is the instruction of this Ministry No. 1438 of this year, which has been repeatedly warned by Liu. Article 86 of the Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that a defendant who does not have the circumstances stipulated in Articles 41 to 43 may also be ordered to post bail or be entrusted, but it clearly states that it is limited to when it is necessary. However, it is found that the courts often abuse this article, and arbitrarily order bail for defendants who should not be detained, regardless of whether it is necessary or not. It is not easy for the defendant to find bail, and the accompanying bailiffs may take the opportunity to demand and make things difficult, so there are those who are illegally detained because they have no bail. This kind of long-standing habit must be thoroughly corrected. In the future, defendants who do not meet the conditions for detention must not be ordered to post bail unless there are special circumstances. When this kind of necessity arises, the method of entrustment should also be considered. Whether the person posting bail or being entrusted is appropriate should be determined by the relevant judicial officer, and must not be completely delegated to the servant. In short, whether the current regulations on detention are properly applied is of great importance to the defendant's freedom rights. As a judicial officer, one must not have the intention of evading responsibility and forgetting the way of respecting human rights." Therefore, this order is given to the President and Chief Prosecutor of the Court for information, and to be relayed to all subordinates for information. This order.</p>
<h3 id="e170">The British, American, and Russian Gasoline War - Car Owners Benefit Greatly <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The Great Beauty Evening News reported that the gasoline sales war between the British, American, and Russian sides is still continuing. Car owners in this port can still enjoy great benefits. It is heard that the Soviet Russian Oil Everywhere Company is currently considering lowering prices again to compete. The main reason is that the Mobil, Asiatic, and Texaco companies previously agreed on a sales volume and established a gentlemen's agreement. If there are excess sales, the three companies will share them. The Soviet Russian Oil Everywhere Company wants to join this agreement and make the excess sales shared by four companies, so it is putting as much pressure as possible on the three companies to force them to agree. It is currently expected that the three companies will not be able to sustain this price competition for long, so the proceeds from the sale of oil will not be able to cover transportation costs, the interests of distributors, and taxes. The situation is different for Soviet Russia. It is heard that it only charges the Guanghua Company two corners per gallon, and the interests of distributors and taxes are borne by Guanghua. Because Soviet Russia is state-owned, its crude oil cost is only the value of the oil workers, so it is heard that the Oil Everywhere Company is willing to temporarily lose money on oil shipped to China for advertising purposes. It is currently building oil storage tanks in Hankou and is engaging in negotiations to establish distribution centers in Hong Kong. It is found that the consumption of gasoline in China is about 9 million gallons per month, and Shanghai accounts for about 1 million gallons, which is one-ninth of the national total. There are more than 25,000 cars in the city.</p>
<h3 id="e171">Foreign Steamer Smashes Cargo Ship - Eighteen Fall into Water - Speeds Away Without Stopping <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>A cargo ship from Xuanzhou, Chaohu, recently loaded 800 dan of wheat bearing the Xie Ji mark in Jiangbei, intending to transport it to Shanghai to deliver it to a flour mill. On the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, as it was sailing past Waisha, Chongming, due to unfavorable winds, it dropped anchor. At that time, a foreign steamer fully loaded with coal came speeding from behind. Upon seeing it, the cargo ship immediately steered towards the shoal to give way and avoid a collision. Unexpectedly, the steamer did not turn its course but continued to sail on. Seeing the steamer approaching, the cargo ship shouted to stop it, but the steamer ignored the warnings and sailed straight on, violently ramming the stern of the cargo ship. The stern was smashed and immediately flooded, and the hull also capsized. The cargo ship cried for help, but the steamer, having caused the accident, still did not stop to provide assistance but increased its speed and sped eastward. The cargo ship had a total of eighteen people on board, including family members and crew, all of whom fell into the water. Fortunately, a Qidong steamer passed by and immediately stopped to provide assistance, rescuing eleven people. The wife and children of the captain were rescued by a pig boat, which transported the rescued wife and children of the captain, along with the crew, to Wusong. The captain discovered that four crew members were still missing. The captain took a train to Shanghai in the afternoon to report the incident, and the flour mill offered to negotiate. According to reports, the steamer had no Chinese characters, and after causing the accident, it did not stop when they cried for help, but continued sailing away. The factory has instructed them to investigate the ships that passed by that day to facilitate negotiations, and is also chartering a ship to inspect whether the cargo can be salvaged. The ship and cargo are valued at 13,000 to 14,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Mr. Yu Binqi, a swimmer in Shanghai, has long been fond of mechanical research and is deeply accomplished. He has made numerous inventions. Years ago, he studied abroad, interning in major factories for many years. After returning to China, he used his experience to create a Chinese typewriter, a steel stencil printer, and an exquisite steel travel pillow-chair. Since their launch, they have been well-received by society and have been repeatedly commended by the Ministry of Industry in accordance with the Special Industries Incentive Regulations promulgated by the National Government and granted patents. Among them, the travel pillow-chair has the greatest utility and the widest sales. The pillow-chair is made of pure steel wire and white canvas and can be used as both a pillow and a chair. As a chair, it is 9.5 inches high and 4.5 inches wide and can withstand 300 pounds of pressure. On pleasant spring and autumn days, it is perfect for a garden rest. As a pillow, it is only half as high, and the steel has elasticity, making it very comfortable to sleep on. When not in use, it can be folded and stored in a bag, weighing only about forty copper coins. Recently, Wang Xiaolai, chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, saw it and greatly appreciated it, believing it to be a necessity for military travel and post-exercise recovery. He urged that its production be increased to supply the public and provided financial assistance to Mr. Yu. A distribution center has been established at No. 266 Beijing Road, Shanghai, Dalai, offering both wholesale and retail and is very welcome. The price is also low, making it affordable for the common people.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Branch of the Shanghai Cigarette Dealers Association issued a notice to its members yesterday to strictly guard against counterfeit cigarettes. The notice stated that the branch has repeatedly received reports from members that many people are selling various counterfeit cigarettes door-to-door, with "Da Zhong Nan" being the most prevalent. Although the counterfeit operations have been repeatedly destroyed by the tax authorities, many smaller dealers have been deceived and harmed, which is countless. All dealers should pay close attention to the above-mentioned situations at all times. In the future, if cigarettes are sold door-to-door, the original sealed oil paper of the carton should be checked for the stamp and the sealed seam marks. If not, it is a fake and should be immediately handed over to the local police station for legal action. At the same time, report to the branch so that it can be submitted to the authorities for strict investigation to prevent future troubles and avoid being implicated and punished. Do not mislead yourselves, this notice is hereby issued.</p>

<p>The houses in Delifang on Route Conty in the French Concession have been owned by the Delifang Company. Since 1928, when the Yixing Company took over the management, the rent has been increased three times. In July of this year, the company wanted to increase the rent again and notified the tenants that the rent would be increased by 30% across the board from July 1st. Those who do not agree should move out. Upon hearing the news, the tenants were all panic-stricken, believing that the original rent was already more expensive than any neighboring area, and now the landlord, regardless of everything, keeps increasing it endlessly, which they cannot afford. Therefore, they unanimously expressed their opposition and held a meeting of all tenants at the Fifth District Branch of the Citizens' Association the day before, deciding that in addition to unanimously opposing the rent increase, Tian Guangquan and others would be appointed as representatives to submit the situation of the landlord ignoring the commercial and social decline and the comparison of rents in neighboring areas to various party and government agencies and the Citizens' Association of the Second Special District, requesting them to take measures to prevent the rent increase.</p>

<p>Some time ago, Feng Mengyun of the Da Jing Bao and Cai Jun, a member of the Long Bao, had a major dispute due to a misunderstanding, which even went to court. However, Feng and Cai were originally friends, but at the time they were driven by anger and neither would give way, resulting in a stalemate that was difficult to resolve. Now, Xie Baosheng and Huang Yuzhai have acted as mediators, and both parties have forgiven each other. However, the rift in their friendship was deep, so Xie and Huang specially hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Western Restaurant last night, inviting more than 200 celebrities and journalists in Shanghai to have a social gathering. Feng and Cai shook hands and spoke with joy, and during the banquet, old grievances were completely dispelled. Both men were committed to friendship and did not dwell on trivial matters. After Xie and Huang mediated further, there were no more misunderstandings. Therefore, the newspaper dispute ended with everyone rejoicing amidst the clinking of glasses.</p>

<p>Xuan Ziye, a wealthy merchant from Gaoyou residing at No. 41 Malong Road, passed away in the winter of 1931. His second wife, Huang, recently accused his eldest son, Xuan Qi, of forging a will in the Second Special District Court. The case was heard by Judge Li Liang in the Seventh Tribunal. The plaintiff was represented by lawyers Zhang Shizhao and E Sen, who stated that the plaintiff married Xuan Ziye as his second wife in 1917 and had two sons and two daughters, all of whom are still young. Xuan Qi was born to the first wife. When Xuan Ziye was dying, he did not make a will. Until August of last year, Xuan Qi suddenly handed Huang a copy of the will, which she found very strange. When she questioned him, the defendant verbally promised to reconcile, but he was insincere. Examining the contents of the will, the defendant, in the position of an heir, in addition to receiving a gift, actually received half of the entire estate, while Xuan Huang and her four children, totaling five shares, only received half of the estate. Moreover, the procedure completely violated legal formalities, which undoubtedly proved that Xuan Qi had forged it after the fact. The defendant Xuan Qi did not appear, and lawyer Gong Yuanbiao appeared on his behalf, stating that the defendant is currently employed at the Nanjing Shanghai Bank and should be under the jurisdiction of the Jiangning Local Court. The plaintiff's lawyer objected and presented many exhibits. After both parties debated once, Judge Li ruled in court that the case should be under the jurisdiction of the Second Special District. The defendant's lawyer then requested a postponement due to issues with his power of attorney, which the court granted, ordering a postponement for further summons.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Urban Youth and Rural Rats <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>Urban youths and rural rats are as different as horses and cows, so how can they be compared? Jesus has his reasons, so please see the explanation below...</p>
<p>More affluent farmers are generally unwilling to sell the harvested rice grains in the same year; they always carefully and solemnly store them in the barn to wait for the coming year, because when new rice comes on the market, the price of rice will decline to some extent. Unless they are in urgent need of money, farmers always sell when the price of rice rises. Everyone will use the trade strategy of "selling at a good price." Unexpectedly, in this year of cheap grain and bumper harvest, the price of rice is going from bad to worse, sinking without end, with no hope of rising, making farmers wait more and more wrong. Not only that, but also rats make trouble, intentionally messing things up, so that storing it for one more day means feeding the rats one more meal. In previous years, the storage days were few, and the losses were not significant. This year, the storage days are many, and the losses are greater. Farmers, seeing the two-fold losses - one is the daily decline in the price of rice, and the other is the nightly theft by rats - increasing day by day, might as well sell the rice and change it into foreign money. In addition to "cheap grain hurting farmers," there is also a bad phenomenon of "rats harming farmers," causing farmers to cry out in pain. Rural rats have become the scourge of the countryside.</p>
<p>As for the urban youths - these young masters and modern girls who only know how to waste in every possible way and do not produce even the slightest bit, they squander the money accumulated by their ancestors' blood and sweat, or by taking responsibility, or by scheming, without the slightest care or heartache, as much as possible. They only harm society and do not benefit it. The standard of living is getting higher day by day, their waste is getting greater day by day, and the harm to society is getting deeper day by day, resulting in unimaginable and irreparable consequences. So, the money bags and foreign boxes of the ancestors are like the barns of farmers; the former hopes that the money will gradually increase, and the latter hopes that the price of rice will gradually rise. Unexpectedly, they suffered the same misfortune, not only failing to increase, but also gradually decreasing. Those who steal the rice are the evil rats, and those who use the money are the modern youths; the former reduce the rice grains in the barn, and the latter reduce the money in the money bags and foreign boxes. Rats are the scourge of the countryside, then modern youths are the scourge of the city. Urban youths and rural rats, both are bad things.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Autumn Fan <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Xian Xian</p>
<p>Hurricanes, one after another, blew the swaying cicada sounds into silence. Therefore, poets are also like Taoists launching a [Peaceful Public Offering], [not forgetting the season], and [Early Autumn Scenery], [Autumn Sentiment], [Autumn Interest], [Sleepless Autumn Night] and other exquisite words, one after another, jumping out of their throats endlessly. Needless to say, besides those [internal war heroes] with malaria, who can take advantage of this time when people are strong and horses are fat to show off their skills, everyone inevitably has a dejected look towards autumn. You see, therefore, flies, mosquitoes, bedbugs, all of whom are famous for following the powerful, how could one not hide or dodge? The [fan], which was the most prominent in the hot weather, is said to be one of the unfortunates.</p>
<p>In hot weather, the [fan] is truly a blessing to people. When the dog's tongue is two or three inches long, everyone [would rather not eat than be without a fan]. But when the autumn wind rises, [even a big fat man weighing two hundred pounds doesn't have a drop of sweat on him], who still cares about the fan used to attract wind? So silk fans, round fans, silk-mounted fans, brocade-mounted fans, have worked hard all summer, but they have to cry and be put into the box by their masters. As for those cattail fans, oilcloth fans, they have shaken their heads and tails all summer and have already given their all, so at this time, they are thrown into the trash can by their masters, or used for fanning the stove. This is called [Autumn Fan's Donation], which is the most heartbreaking thing.</p>
<p>There are many people in society who have status and are all propped up by others. When they have not yet succeeded, they are naturally very good to those who support them, just like in the hot summer, they are unwilling to let go of the fan even for a moment. Once they are propped up to success, it is as if the weather has dropped from nearly 100 degrees to the 50s or 60s. Seeing the [fan], they feel it is cumbersome, so they throw it away, and the fan is finished. [Even if the autumn fan lies in the trash can crying and wiping tears, or hiding behind the coal stove, raging, it is in vain. The best example is those [founding heroes] of [Manchukuo]. They act as accomplices for the tiger, fabricate public opinion, and try to please their masters in every way, which is like a fan in the hot June, [a gentle breeze], how pleasing. But, be careful, once the summer is over, the weather becomes cooler day by day, and once Japan's [swallowing Manchu plan] matures, the so-called [founding heroes] will inevitably be hidden or thrown away, and there is a danger of becoming a donated [autumn fan].</p>

<p>No one who hears the order from a lover dares to disobey. Everyone obeys completely. Even if they have no money to buy it, they will pawn their clothes to do so. Otherwise, the lover will bluntly and impolitely fall in love with someone else. He does it for the lover.</p>

<p>This is the emcee's command at a wedding.</p>
<p>Anyone getting married is willing to obey the emcee's command. The reason is for the wife, so they would rather bend their backs and waist to bow and dare not disobey the emcee's command.</p>

<p>— Yanqiao</p>
<p>[With ten thousand strings of cash around his waist, he rides a crane to Yangzhou.] Six or seven hundred years ago, poets already had such extravagant hopes. After the embellishment by the salt merchants of the early Qing Dynasty, it naturally became even more touching. Zheng Banqiao said, "Thousands of families raise daughters, teaching them music first; planting flowers for ten miles is like farming the fields." Although it feels a bit excessive, there is at least something symbolic about it. Xu Zhu'an also said, "How could the myriad people know of such extravagant wishes? They all rush to sing 'Spring Breeze' in the style of the infant's babbling. It's pitiful that they have to exchange flawless jade for gold to enrich the old men." I'm afraid this was still a matter of decades ago. Now, the "flawless jade" of Yangzhou, when exchanged for gold, may not be able to make the old men rich. As for the "infant's babbling" that crosses the river to the sea, it is even more unthinkable. The gold they exchange for goes to enrich the fake mothers. Yangzhou! Yangzhou! Isn't it just getting worse and worse?</p>
<p>In my past years, whenever I went to Yangzhou, Nanjing, Biling, or Zhenjiang, I always wanted to visit Yangzhou, but I never could. It wasn't until this year's Qingming Festival that my wish finally came true. From Twelve Forts to the green willow-lined city walls, the car bouncing in the dust made me feel unhappy to begin with. When I arrived at Slender West Lake, although there were crowds of men and women like clouds, the Lama Temple, the Five Pavilion Bridge, Little Jinshan, and Xu Garden were all clearly visible. I truly felt pitifully tired. Only the weeping willows on the opposite bank of the city moat, like loose hair, were more gentle and restrained than the Yangzhou women I saw. A bamboo pole with a makeshift boat resembling a sightseeing boat on Daming Lake was vigorously pushed across the textured water. The boat slowly drifted over, and the gentle breeze awakened my lingering drowsiness. I listened to an old beggar by the shore singing the song "The National Revolution is Successful" while holding out a cloth bag to beg for money. Yangzhou! Yangzhou! — Is he the only one who has grasped the gears of the times?</p>
<p>[Jiangnan looks good from Jiangbei, but once you get to Jiangbei, you regret it]. Enough, enough. At least my diary, which I have kept without interruption for twenty years, has a page about going to Yangzhou.</p>

<p>The word "success" means money, which also means ease and happiness. The magic of these two words constantly lures all of humanity.</p>
<p>There are three times when people can tell secrets: first, when they are drunk; second, when they are in love; and third, when they are both drunk and in love.</p>
<p>A weakness of humankind is to consider what belongs to others as the best.</p>
<p>Life is all about putting on a show. Once you realize that others are also struggling to put on a show, then you can boldly put on your own show.</p>
<p>The employed class and the employing class have one thing in common: the whip. The handle of the whip is in the hands of the employing class, and the stripes of the whip are on the backs of the working class. This can symbolize the relationship between the two classes forever.</p>

<p>Chapter Sixteen: Bitterness and Sadness Held in the Heart, Blessings Given Before Departure; Busy with Military Affairs, Troops Secretly Moved.</p>
<p>He sat in his own room, thinking blankly. Suddenly, he heard someone outside the door say, "Is Old Zhao in?" As he spoke, the person walked into the room. Then, he clapped his hands and said, "Ha! A volley of guns and cannons brings ten thousand taels of gold." Old Zhao, why do you look so listless? It turned out to be Company Commander Yin Deren, who had walked in. Zhao Ziqiang stood up and smiled, "You are single. Hearing about the departure, you will first not have your meals deducted, and second, get a bit of departure pay. Why wouldn't you be happy?" Yin Deren laughed, "I know, you can't put down that fiancée of yours. What's the big deal? Just take her with you." Zhao Ziqiang said, "Taking a married wife is already a burden. How can I take a fiancée who isn't yet married? Besides, our departure this time is probably to go back and fight in Fengtian. That's no joke. Would they even let us take our families with us to live a comfortable life?" Yin Deren laughed, "So you're here worrying all by yourself, because you can't take your wife with you to fight a war. What's the big deal? Just consider that you haven't gotten engaged to the Yang family girl yet. You're still single, and you'll be free wherever you go. Then there won't be any big problems." Zhao Ziqiang said, "Although that's how you put it, but..." He pondered for a long time, and he couldn't say the sentence. Yin Deren laughed, "People's hearts are made of flesh. You're such a good wife, just about to be in your hands, and now you have to leave her. Tell me, who wouldn't be sad?" Having spoken, he lightly gave a "haha." Zhao Ziqiang said, "I'm not joking. Think, how unfortunate is this situation? The day after I got engaged, there was a separation. First, my father can't bear to part with me. Second, he and the Yang family live in the front and back courtyards, and he can't avoid seeing them morning and night. If he hears any gossip about them, I'm afraid it will make him even more upset in his heart." (207)</p>

<h3 id="e204">Gansu and Ningxia Athletes Arrive in Beijing; Encounter Bandits En Route, Plead Repeatedly, Pay 60 Yuan in Total for Safe Passage <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Liaoning Swimming Athletes Arrived in Beijing First —</p>
<p>A total of fifteen athletes from Ningxia and Gansu provinces arrived in Pu at 8:00 AM yesterday morning. The reception team from the organizing committee sent cars to welcome them to the Central Stadium. After completing the registration procedures, they were assigned to the athlete dormitory at Yuan Zi No. 1. According to the team, which departed from Ningxia on September 18, they encountered many bandits at Xishan Mouth, about 800 li away. After repeated negotiations, the bandits saw that they were all poor students without many possessions. The Gansu and Ningxia teams paid a total of 60 yuan, and they were allowed to pass safely. After arriving in Ping, they were stranded for another five or six days and only arrived in Beijing this morning. The province is far away in the border region, and transportation is inconvenient. They felt quite tired after many days en route. Therefore, when reporters visited, they were all sound asleep in the dormitory. It was said that it was easy to come, but it would take at least more than a month to return to the province. The only newspaper in the area is the "Republic Daily" run by the provincial party headquarters, which publishes only two small sheets daily. News from the central government is received via radio broadcasts. The "Shen Bao" and "Xin Wen Bao" newspapers from Shanghai arrive 15 to 20 days later. Since Chairman Ma came to the province, education has been vigorously promoted. There is now one middle school and one normal school, which are combined into one location, with about 300 students. The Second Middle School is under preparation, with only 50 students. In addition, there is a girls' normal school and an attached elementary school with about 100 female students in total. When they set off, it happened to be when the elementary school teachers were on strike due to unpaid salaries. Since school education is like this, there is even less to talk about in terms of sports. Only Wu Jiujiu on this team has relatively good sprinting results. In the Northwest Games, his results were 11.6 seconds for the 100 meters, 22.4 seconds for the 200 meters, and 54 seconds for the 400 meters. It is hard to be sure if he will be able to score points in the future. It was also said that three of the seven members of the team are Muslims. Fortunately, the organizing committee has made preparations for halal food, so there should not be any dietary difficulties.</p>
<p>Gansu: A total of eight people, led by Wang Dehou, secretary Sun Yatian, athletes Yang Junlin, Wang Yuchun, Men Shenglin, Zhang Qian, Zhang Weihui, and Qiang Jingbang. Among them, Zhang Qian's javelin results are better. Zhang Jun participated in the Northwest Games held in Ningxia on the 10th of last month and won first place in the javelin with a result of 34.50 meters.</p>
<p>Liaoning: The athletes Shi Xingteng, Shi Xinglu, and Shi Ruisheng (female) have already arrived yesterday, with Shi Xing serving as the leader. They are all swimming athletes. The remaining athletes are expected to arrive in Beijing this morning. The team is currently residing in rooms 2 and 3 of the Yuan Zi building. The three Shis are all famous swimming experts. The sister of Shi Xinglong proves that they come from a family with a long tradition of scholarship. They are sure to achieve satisfactory results in swimming.</p>

<p>The Yunnan athletes participating in the National Games, a group of eleven people, led by Luo Xueyuan, arrived in Shanghai the day before yesterday. The Shanghai Yunnan Association hosted a special banquet last night. They will take a train to Beijing at 8:00 AM this morning.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Recent Developments in Yunnan Sports <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>According to team leader Luo Xueyuan, Yunnan is located in a remote border area and has inconvenient transportation, so sports development is lagging behind. However, as a result of recent vigorous promotion efforts, it is gradually flourishing. Recently, the Yunnan Sports Association has been established, and Kunming, the provincial capital, has also built new swimming pools and public sports fields. In addition, the provincial chairman has a keen interest in sports and has strongly promoted them. The athletes this time were selected by the provincial games. Compared to others, their results are slightly worse. However, they have come from afar and aim to observe and learn.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Banquet by the Yunnan Association <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Last night at 6:00 PM, Xu Yunzhi, principal of Pudong Middle School in this city, specially hosted a banquet at the Jieerjing Yunnan Restaurant on Lüyan Road on behalf of the Yunnan Association to welcome all the athletes. Those present included Song Chongjiu, Hu Zhongming, Zhou Hanzhang, Feng Ruji, and team leader Luo Xueyuan, administrator Zhao Guanghan, and athlete Liu Cuncun, as well as many famous people from Yunnan who are living in Shanghai. Xu and Song each gave speeches, wishing the athletes victory and saying that this arduous journey to participate in the National Games has opened a new era for the sports community in Yunnan, and the achievements of these gentlemen cannot be erased. Team leader Luo gave a reply, and the guests chatted happily until 9:00 PM. The results of the nine members of the athlete team are as follows:</p>
<p>Team Leader Luo Xueyuan, Captain Liu Cunzhong, Administrator Zhao Guanghan.</p>
<p>Yang Wenbiao: Long Jump 5.70 meters, Triple Jump 12 meters</p>
<p>Lin Guozhu: Triple Jump 12 meters, High Jump 1.60 meters, Hurdles 19 seconds</p>

<p>Zhao Yinzu: Decathlon 4020 points</p>

<h3 id="e208">Swimming Match: Fujian Loses to Shanghai College; Results Average, Fujian Lacks Outstanding Talent; Wen Jingling of Shanghai College Excels in Short Distances <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>The Fujian swimming team participating in the National Games competed against the Shanghai University swimming team at 4:00 PM yesterday at the Shanghai University swimming pool. As a result, Shanghai University won. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>50-yard Freestyle: (1) Wen Jingling (Shanghai), (2) Ye Desheng (Fujian), (3) Lin Jiangshui (Shanghai) 28.2 seconds</p>
<p>100-yard Freestyle: (1) Wen Jingling (Shanghai), (2) Lin Jiangshui (Shanghai), (3) Wang Honglong (Fujian) 66.9 seconds</p>
<p>400-yard Freestyle: (1) Wang Honglong (Fujian), (2) Lin Huitian (Shanghai), (3) Zhu Zhenxiang (Shanghai) 6 minutes 24.9 seconds</p>
<p>100-yard Backstroke: (1) Chen Tianqing (Shanghai), (2) Chen Demin (Fujian), (3) Zhang Yifa (Shanghai) 1 minute 27.9 seconds</p>
<p>200-yard Breaststroke: (1) Deng Chonghuang (Fujian), (2) Xu Xifan (Shanghai) 3 minutes 17.2 seconds</p>
<p>1500-yard Freestyle: (1) Wang Honglong (Fujian), (2) Zhang Yifa (Shanghai) 26 minutes 26 seconds</p>
<p>200-yard Relay: (1) Shanghai University, (2) Fujian 2 minutes 6 seconds</p>
<p>In yesterday's competition, the short-distance results of Wen Jingling of Shanghai University, a National Games athlete from this city, were the most outstanding in the 50-yard and 100-yard freestyle, with a wide gap between him and the second place. The remaining results were average. Fujian Province lacks outstanding talent. Although Wang Honglong won in the long distances, Shanghai University lacks long-distance talent, so there is nothing remarkable about it. Wang's results still need to improve. The Fujian athletes had a high speed in the backstroke event, but they did not know how to turn. Every time they turned, they lost a lot of time. The third place was a Fujian athlete, but he was disqualified for not complying with the turning rules, and the fourth place was promoted. Liu Lingci, the only swimming athlete from the Philippines to attend the National Games, participated in the 200-meter breaststroke as a performance, but ended up in fourth place. The relay race was completed after the lights were turned on.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Nanjing Has Rain All Day; Construction of National Games Venue Halted; Organizing Committee Members All Worried About the Prolonged Rain; Prizes Include a Gold Spear from Chairman Lin, Which Is Very Valuable <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The organizing committee received telegrams from Hunan, Shanxi, Anhui, and Shandong provinces, stating that the representative teams from each province have departed. Nanjing has had continuous rain for days, and it rained heavily all day on the 5th. The roads are muddy, and the unfinished projects at the National Games venue cannot continue. With only five days left until the Games, the members of the organizing committee are all worried about the prolonged rain, but there is no way to remedy it. According to those in charge of the organizing committee, the issue of rain during the Games period has not yet been considered. The publicity regulations for all news of the Games will be handed over to consultants Song Gengcun and Qian Xiaohe from the 6th. Song and Qian will be working full-time at the Central Stadium starting on the 6th, and the publicity team will assign personnel to be responsible for interviewing each group.</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 5th) The various preparations for the National Games are being rushed in full swing. Most of the staff members from various groups have moved into the sports field to work. Athletes from all over the country have also set off for Beijing. The list of Yunnan athletes arrived on the 5th, totaling 25 people. A total of 15 male athletes from Gansu and Ningxia arrived in Beijing on the morning of the 5th and are staying in the designated dormitory at the sports field. The athletes from these two provinces will participate in track and field events. Before their departure, they participated in the Northwest Games and won many track and field titles. The schedule for the national martial arts competition and performances has been arranged. Although the order of various competitions for the National Games has been published in the newspapers, there are still many changes. It will not be announced until the 8th. The guest passes and invitations for the conference have also been made and sent out. The special guest passes are blue with white letters, and the ordinary guest passes are red with white letters. The invitations are divided into two types: red with black letters and white with blue letters. The dormitories for the athletes and referees have all been allocated.

<h3 id="e219">Attendees <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Included the Mayor's wife, Director Pan of the Municipal Education Bureau, Section Chief Chen, Huang Tiren of the Municipal Party Headquarters, Jin Keying of the Land Bureau, Zheng Xigu, principal of Shanghai Provincial High School, Zhang Qidong of the Chinese Sports Association, Ma Chonggan and Rong Qizhao of the Municipal Games, athletes attending the National Games, and more than 300 award-winning athletes.

<h3 id="e220">Director's Address <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>The meeting commenced at two o'clock. The chairman was Director Pan, the emcee was Yuan Zengyu, and the recorders were Ding Shoutang and Chen Guangling. The rituals were duly performed. Mayor Wu was unable to attend due to other engagements, so Director Pan delivered the address on his behalf. He stated, in brief, that today's gathering, holding both the oath-taking ceremony for the city's delegation to the National Games and the awards ceremony for the City Games, is a glorious and solemn occasion. Mayor Wu was unable to attend due to other engagements, so he has sent a representative to deliver the speech. The relationship between sports and the nation is clear to everyone, but it is hoped that everyone will not only pursue their own physical fitness but also use their strength to spread the spirit of valuing sports throughout the country, so that all the people can participate and strengthen their bodies to undertake arduous and difficult tasks. Shanghai occupies an important position in China and should make greater efforts to promote sports. We know that the current situation is extraordinary. In the fifteen years since the European War, the world has experienced first a period of reform, then a period of recovery, and in the last five or six years, a period of intense crisis. All phenomena, and the intensity of competition, have returned to the state before the European War. Scholars who study world issues deeply believe that the outbreak of a second world war is imminent, and it will certainly involve China. When great calamity befalls us, China's land will become a battlefield, its people will become sacrifices on the battlefield, and China's products will be used to supply the needs of the battlefield. In this period, China has only two paths: revival or destruction. If we want to revive, we must prepare for all aspects of a second world war, using manpower to develop land and create wealth, so that at least at that time, we can support resistance on our own land and have a chance of revival. Therefore, the importance of sports is not only for the individual but is related to the survival of the entire nation. You are all strong members of the sports community and will be at the forefront of national sacrifice in the future. In this National Games, it is hoped that first, you will have a spirit of cooperation, taking care of the entire delegation; second, you will uphold sportsmanship, absolutely abide by the regulations and discipline of the conference, and obey commands. Then, even if you do not win medals, you can increase the glory of our city.</p>

<p>The international convention on international mobile educational film measures and its guarantee implementation measures were sent by the League of Nations to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and forwarded to the Ministry of Education for review and approval. As the League of Nations meeting is approaching, our country has sent Minister Hu Shize to attend the meeting regarding educational films. Because the meeting is scheduled to open on October 5th, the draft treaty and measures must be signed. Our country has expressed its approval of the draft treaty, but when educational films produced by various signatory countries apply for exemption from customs duties upon import, our country must still retain the right of inspection to prevent abuses. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in response to Minister Hu's telegram requesting instructions from Beijing, has telegraphed the minister to sign the treaty in accordance with the Ministry of Education's review opinion to retain the right of inspection.</p>
<p>The following is an excerpt of the main points of the draft treaty on international circulation of educational films related to education:</p>
<p>The League of Nations' protocol on the international circulation of educational films stipulates that educational films may circulate freely internationally.</p>
<p>The signatory countries, members and non-members of the League of Nations, (1) firmly believe that educational films can enhance mutual understanding between nations and promote military cooperation, which is in line with the purpose of the League of Nations; (2) firmly believe that educational films are an effective tool for promoting progress in intellectual, moral, and physical education, and therefore it is essential to have free circulation internationally; (3) are well aware that educational films are not yet widespread and that the scope of their distribution internationally is too narrow; (4) feel that customs duties are a major obstacle to the popularity of educational films, and that the financial benefits gained by various countries as a result cannot compensate for the educational losses incurred.</p>
<p>Therefore, the following clauses are agreed upon. These clauses aim to clarify the meaning of educational films and to adopt the method of exempting customs duties, so that they can circulate freely internationally (Our country must still retain the right of inspection to prevent abuses). (Article 1) According to the meaning of this treaty, films that conform to educational principles are defined as international educational films: (1) Films that accurately convey news of international organizations recognized by member states of the League of Nations and other countries that have been formally recognized by member states of the League of Nations; (2) Films that are prepared for schools of all levels; (3) Films that aim to provide vocational training, vocational guidance, and for the work of scientific organizations; (4) Films that relate to scientific research or technical research, or aim to promote scientific knowledge; (5) Films that relate to health issues, physical exercise, public welfare, and charitable undertakings. (Article 2) Within six months of the entry into force of this treaty, each signatory country shall, in accordance with the provisions of this treaty, exempt educational films produced by film companies or film organizations within the territory of other signatory countries from customs duties and all surtaxes, except for postage, registration fees, and transportation costs for import and export.</p>
<p>The countries agreed that educational films conforming to one of the following clauses shall be subject to the preceding provision of this article: (1) The negative has been shot and developed; (2) The positive has been shot and printed.</p>
<p>As for sound films, dialogue films, and sound commemorative films, the provisions of this treaty shall also apply.</p>
<p>Each signatory country, in accordance with the provisions of the preceding paragraph of this article, shall further agree that the inland tax on the sale or transfer of educational films produced in other signatory countries shall not exceed the amount collected by the country of origin.</p>
<p>(Article 3) Films applying for exemption from customs duties in accordance with the provisions of this treaty must be sent to the International Educational Film Association for review. If the association recognizes the film as an educational film in accordance with the provisions of Article 1 of this treaty, it may issue a license (omitted below).</p>
<p>(Article 4) (1) If the authorities of the importing country deny that the film is an educational film and reject the request for exemption from customs duties, and the government of the producing country believes that the circulation of the film is very beneficial from the standpoint of a country's culture, then the government of the producing country may kindly inform the government of the importing country, and the two governments shall jointly discuss the issue. (2) (3) Omitted. (4) If the authorities of the importing country believe that the film does not conform to the meaning of education, educational principles, or reject exemption from customs duties for other reasons of public interest, then the preceding articles shall not be cited. (Article 5) (Omitted). (Article 6) This treaty stipulates that it shall not interfere with the laws and regulations of each signatory country regarding the inspection of films, or the plan to crack down on the import or transfer of films for the sake of social security.</p>
<p>(Article 7) For educational films stipulated in accordance with Article 1, each signatory country shall formulate special preferential tax reduction and freight exemption measures.</p>
<p>(Article 8) Within six months of the effective implementation of this treaty, each signatory country shall notify each other and report to the International Educational Film Association of the following two clauses: (1) The names of the organizations that are exempt from customs duties in accordance with Article 3; (2) Detailed measures for implementing the various articles of this treaty.</p>
<p>(Article 10) Omitted. (Article 11) This treaty shall be based on the English and French source texts as the standard. Member states or non-member states of the League of Nations may approve it within six months.</p>
<p>(Article 12) This treaty shall be effective only after ratification. The instruments of ratification shall be deposited with the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, and the Secretary-General shall notify the member states and non-member states of the League of Nations of the deposit and the effective date of the deposit.</p>
<p>(Article 13 Article 14) Omitted. (Article 15) (1) This treaty shall expire three years after the date of its implementation; (2) The expiration of this treaty shall be notified by the signatory country to the Secretary-General of the League of Nations, and the Secretary-General shall notify all member and non-member states of the League of Nations of the notice and the date of receipt of the document; (3) This treaty shall expire one year after the receipt of the notice.</p>
<p>(Article 16) (1) (2) (3) (4) Each clause is omitted. (Article 17) This treaty must be registered by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations before it can be effectively implemented.</p>
<p>The plenipotentiaries of various countries signed this treaty in Geneva. A copy of the signature book is now kept in the archives of the Secretariat of the League of Nations, and after being reproduced in the same way, it will be distributed to the member and non-member states of the League of Nations.</p>

<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities on the 4th, stating that "The Executive Yuan's Instruction No. 4547 states, [The National Government's Instruction No. 446 states, [The Central Executive Committee's Letter states, [Upon investigation, regarding the improvement of Party Ideology Education, the Ministry of Education's proposed method for consolidating Party Ideology textbooks for primary and secondary schools was approved by this committee last year. Recently, it was found that the Ministry of Education has issued a notice to all primary and secondary schools across the country to discontinue Party Ideology courses from the first semester of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, and to adopt social textbooks such as Civics, History, and Geography for primary and secondary schools that have been re-edited by the Ministry, which incorporate the Party Ideology of this Party. Although Party Ideology will not be set up as a separate course from now on, the aforementioned subjects such as Civics, History, and Geography are closely related to Party Ideology, and it is still necessary to pay attention to the selection of teachers who are responsible for these courses, especially Civics, which is the most important. Except for primary schools, which do not have a Civics course and do not have full-time teachers, it is necessary to review the qualifications of Civics teachers and deans of students in all secondary schools in accordance with the method of reviewing the qualifications of Party Ideology teachers. Therefore, the Regulations on Reviewing the Qualifications of Civics Teachers in Secondary Schools, the Regulations on Reviewing the Qualifications of Deans of Students in Secondary Schools, and the Organizational Regulations of the Committee for Reviewing the Qualifications of Deans of Students and Civics Teachers have been formulated and submitted to the 86th Standing Committee of this Committee for approval. Furthermore, primary school teachers are related to the enlightenment of children's thinking, and they should all have a correct understanding of the Three Principles of the People. Therefore, it was resolved at the same meeting that primary school teachers should pay attention to their understanding of Party Ideology when they are examined or tested. Except for those who have studied Party Ideology courses at school, they should be examined. If the test results are not good, they should be ordered to take supplementary lessons. The detailed methods will be formulated by the Ministry of Education as soon as possible. In addition to issuing a notice to the party departments of various provinces and cities to comply with it, and abolishing the previously issued Regulations on Reviewing the Qualifications of Party Ideology Teachers, the Regulations on Reviewing the Qualifications of Civics Teachers in Secondary Schools, the Regulations on Reviewing the Qualifications of Deans of Students in Secondary Schools, and the Organizational Regulations of the Committee for Reviewing the Qualifications of Deans of Students and Civics Teachers are attached in one copy each and sent for your records.

<p>—Date to be Determined Separately—</p>
<p>The city's fifth Scouting Grand Review and Grand Jamboree, originally scheduled to be held in the downtown area on the National Day of October 10th, has been postponed due to continuous rainfall, which has made the ground loose and muddy. Furthermore, the Japanese Municipal Security Team, Police Headquarters, Defense Corps, and Fire Brigade are all holding reviews at the same location, making it inconvenient for the Boy Scouts to camp. Yesterday, Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao), Leng Xueqiao, Qu Yue, Yu Kuaiyuan, Gong Jingyuan, Zhang Xunfang, Luo Lie, and others from the organizing committee went to inspect the campsite and all felt it was not suitable for camping. Therefore, it was proposed at the fourth preparatory meeting and unanimously decided that if it continues to rain on the 6th, the event will be postponed. The date will be determined separately. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter met with Luo Lie, the secretary of the association, and learned that it had been decided to postpone the event.</p>

<p>— and More</p>
<p>I want to praise some people of the past, which is probably not [a love of skeletons].</p>
<p>The so-called people of the past refer to the so-called "new party" in the late Guangxu period. In the early Republic of China, they were called the "old new party." After the defeat in the Sino-Japanese War, they considered themselves enlightened and wanted to "reform." Even middle-aged people in their thirties and forties were reading [Practical Arithmetic Talks] and [Chemical Mirror Origins]. They also wanted to learn English and Japanese, reciting with stiff tongues and strange voices, without any sense of shame. The goal was to read [foreign books] because they wanted to bring [wealth and power] to China. Even now, old book stalls occasionally have [Wealth and Power Series] appearing, just like the current [Descriptive Dictionary] [Basic English], which were products of that era. Even Zhang Zhidong, who came from the eight-legged essay, also asked Miao Quansun to compile [Booklist Answers] for him and tried his best to add various translations, showing the intensity of the [reform] trend.</p>
<p>However, the current phenomenon is different. Some new youths have a situation that is exactly the opposite of the [old new party]. They have not been contaminated by the eight-legged essay at all, and they come from schools, but they are not experts in national studies. However, they have begun to learn seal script, fill in lyrics, and encourage people to read [Zhuangzi] and [Literary Selections]. Their envelopes also have self-carved printing plates, and their poems are also written in square characters. Except for their fondness for writing new poems, they are simply like elegant people in the early Guangxu period, except that they lack braids and sometimes wear Western clothes.</p>
<p>Recently, there is a common saying: [Old bottles cannot hold new wine]. This is actually inaccurate. Old bottles can hold new wine, and new bottles can also hold old wine. If you don't believe it, try swapping a bottle of Wujiapi and a bottle of brandy. The Wujiapi in the brandy bottle is still Wujiapi. This simple experiment not only shows the style of [Wugeng Tune] [Zan Shi Zi], but also allows new content to be put into it, and it also confirms that the shell of the new youth can hide the minions of [Tongcheng Heresy] or [Literary Deviants].</p>
<p>Although the vision of the [old new party] was shallow, they had one purpose: to seek wealth and power. Therefore, they were firm and practical. Although their foreign language was strange, they had one purpose: to seek the art of wealth and power. Their seriousness was genuine and enthusiastic. When the anti-Manchu theory spread, many people became revolutionaries, still because they wanted to bring wealth and power to China and believed that this must begin with anti-Manchuism.</p>
<p>Anti-Manchuism has long been successful, and the May Fourth Movement has long passed. Seal script, lyrics, [Zhuangzi], [Literary Selections], ancient-style envelopes, and square-character new poems. Now we have new attempts to establish ourselves in the world with [classical elegance]. If we can really establish ourselves, that would add a new example to [the struggle for survival].</p>
<h3 id="e246">Re-Discussing Opium <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Zhan</p>
<p>Yesterday, I visited Mr. Zhao Yuchuan, and he showed me the ninth volume of the Wan Guo Gong Bao (The Chinese Recorder) from 1889. It contained an article about opium, written by someone named Joseph Edkins. This gentleman discussed opium from the perspectives of Greece, Latin countries, and Arabia, to China. The article was quite long, five or six thousand words, with numerous references. I suspect he is a Westerner with a deep understanding of Chinese studies. If he is Chinese, then he is also quite knowledgeable in Western learning.</p>
<p>During the Sui and Tang Dynasties in China, the Arabs established the Great Arabian Empire. They highly valued Greek medicine for treating various diseases, and opium was among the medicines used. The ancient Greek pharmacologist Dioscorides, in his compilation of ten thousand medicinal materials, indeed mentioned that opium had the effects of calming the nerves, relieving pain, and aiding eye recovery.</p>
<p>The Arabian Empire began trading with China during the reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang. Arab merchants sailed to Guangzhou and other seaports, bringing goods such as ivory, frankincense, pig iron, cotton, borneol, white sugar, glassware, rose water, and various medicinal materials for trade. Poppy seeds were likely among the medicinal materials. Based on the situation in Europe, it is likely that China had not yet encountered poppy flowers before that time. It is also called "Mi Xiang Hua" (Rice Fragrance Flower) because its fruit resembles a sac, and its seeds resemble rice, hence the name.</p>
<p>During the reign of Emperor Minghuang of Tang, Chen Zangqi mentioned the words of Song Yangzi, saying that poppies have four petals, red and white, with light red halos. The seed pod is shaped like a sac, and the arrows used by archers contain fine grains. Additionally, Guo 　Tuo's "Book on Planting Trees" of the Tang Dynasty states that planting poppies on the ninth day of the ninth lunar month or during the Mid-Autumn Festival will result in larger flowers and fuller seeds (see the Compilation of Illustrations and Writings from the Complete Collection of Ancient and Modern Books, Section on Plants and Trees, Examination of Poppy Seed Department and Flower Department). According to Liu Zongyuan's biography of Guo 　Tuo, it can be confirmed that Guo 　also lived during the prosperous Tang Dynasty, around the same time as Chen Zangqi. From Emperor Taizong to Emperor Minghuang, a century passed, and the Arabian Empire had been trading with China for a long time. China already knew how to cultivate poppies, which is entirely plausible.</p>
<p>In the sixth year of the Kai Bao era of Emperor Taizu of Song, he ordered Liu Han, a pharmacist, and nine Daoist priests, including Ma Zhi, to revise the Kai Bao Materia Medica. They referred to poppies as "Ying Zi Su" (Poppy Seed Millet), also known as "Mi Nang Zi" (Rice Sac Seed) and "Yu Mi" (Imperial Rice). It was also stated that its grains mainly treat the movement of Dan Shi (cinnabar), loss of appetite. It can be cooked with bamboo sap into a porridge that is extremely delicious. Furthermore, Emperor Renzong of Song ordered all counties and prefectures to illustrate the medicinal materials produced locally, following the example of Emperor Gaozong of Tang who ordered the Duke of Ying Guo to compile the Tang Materia Medica. He specifically instructed Su Song, a doctor of the Imperial Academy, to compile and narrate the illustrated Materia Medica. This book stated that poppy flowers are found everywhere, and people often plant them for decoration. There are two types, red and white flowers, with a slight fishy smell. The fruit is shaped like a bottle, and the seeds are extremely fine like grains of rice. Gardeners fertilize the soil every other year, sow the seeds in the ninth month, and the seedlings begin to grow after winter and into spring, growing very lushly. Otherwise, they will not grow, or they will not thrive. They are harvested when the pods turn yellow. It also stated that poppy seed porridge can be used to treat vomiting and regurgitation, using three he of white poppy seeds, three qian of ginseng powder, and five cun of finely chopped fresh yam, grinding the three ingredients together. Add two sheng and three he of water to extract six he, then add fresh ginger juice and a little salt, mix well, and take in divided doses, regardless of the time of day, without interfering with other decoctions or pills. Moreover, during the Zhenghe era of Emperor Huizong of Song, Kou Zongshi, a medical official, wrote "Danyan Yanyi Materia Medica," briefly stating that poppy seeds are cold in nature, and excessive consumption can lead to bowel movements. Grind and boil them in water, add honey to make a soup, which is very suitable for drinking. Other works, such as Yang Shi Ying's "Zhi Zhi Fang" (Direct Pointers), Wang Qiu's "Bai Yi Xuan Fang" (Hundred and One Selected Prescriptions), and Wang Shuo's "Yi Jian Fang" (Simple Prescriptions), all state that poppy shells are effective in treating dysentery. Based on the above statements, it can be proven that people in the Song Dynasty already used poppy seeds or their shells to boil soup and make pills to treat diseases, considering it a precious product for treating dysentery. As for Song poems that mention poppies, in addition to the poems by Su Shi and Su Zhe mentioned earlier, there is also a seven-character quatrain by Xie Yu, praising poppy flowers:</p>
<p>Lead paste delicately dots the flower tips,</p>
<p>It is said that spring is deep and the snow has not melted.</p>
<p>A hu of a thousand sacs of pale jade millet,</p>
<p>The east wind blows, making the rice grow long waists.</p>
<p>Jin Liuhe's "Xuan Ming Fang" treats chronic coughs and night sweats with two and a half liang of poppy shells, removing the stems and membranes, stir-fried with vinegar, taking one liang, and half a liang of black plum, baked into powder. Take two qian per dose, taken with white soup at bedtime. Furthermore, Li Gao said that poppy capsules have the effect of astringing and solidifying qi, and can enter the kidneys, so they are especially suitable for treating bone diseases. Additionally, Wei Yilin's "De Xiao Fang" treats chronic diarrhea that does not stop, using poppy shells to remove the tendons, roasted with honey into powder, taking five fen per dose, taken with honey soup, which is effective. Moreover, Zhu Zhenheng said that nowadays people with consumption cough often use poppy shells to stop bleeding, and those with damp-heat dysentery use them to stop astringency. Although its curative effect is urgent, it kills people like a sword, so caution should be taken. Based on the above statements, it can be seen that during the Jin and Yuan dynasties, poppy shells were not only used to treat dysentery but also used to treat coughs and bone diseases. As for Zhu Zhenheng's statement that it kills people like a sword, so caution should be taken, it can be seen that at that time, there were already people who had died from opium poisoning. As for its appearance in literature, Feng Zizhen's "Eighteen Rhapsodies" states, "Some wear poppies after the rain, or frost-covered chrysanthemum flowers," indicating that poppy flowers were also used for ornamental purposes.</p>
<h3 id="e247">A Way to Relieve Boredom <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Bi</p>
<p>Are you bored?</p>
<p>[What if I am bored?] you might retort.</p>
<p>As long as you are willing to retort, I have something to say, because I know what to do when bored. I have a plan to relieve boredom.</p>
<p>For example, if you feel extremely tired and bored, and don't know what to do, just feeling listless, then you can go out. Outside the door, there will always be examples of people who are not bored.</p>
<p>When you first step out, your steps will undoubtedly be heavy, and you will have to drag them. But after dragging for a while, you will suddenly hear a sound, a very leisurely sound, floating lightly from who knows where. So you look up and see a huqin seller walking towards you. You see him pulling the bow, with many huqins of various sizes on his back. Although he is in such a busy city, he doesn't look at anything or anyone, just playing a clear and fluent tune, with an attitude of complete nonchalance.</p>
<p>[If only I had such a huqin,] you might suddenly realize, [I would naturally be able to be nonchalant too.]</p>
<p>Since that's the case, why shouldn't you also have such a huqin? You have no reason not to have one, so you get one too.</p>
<p>And so, from then on, you also play your huqin, and your boredom is dispelled. You can also not look at anything or anyone, just play, with an attitude of nonchalance. [Learning to be like a huqin seller,] you finally confirm, [is definitely not a difficult thing; why not learn something so easy and continue to be bored?]</p>
<p>Because you have already realized this yourself, you can't understand why other people are still bored. Maybe it's because they don't see through things like you do, and they are preoccupied with the gains and losses of food and clothing. The only ones who see through things, besides yourself, are the huqin seller, you believe. You believe he also feels extremely [tired] and [bored], which is why he plays the huqin on the street in such a leisurely and [nonchalant] way. Also, it's not just the huqin that can dispel boredom, but also books, lovers, the clouds in the sky, and the wildflowers by the roadside. If you lose faith in A today, you can have faith in B tomorrow... as long as you are flexible, you will always find an object that will make you no longer bored.</p>

<p>She only cried out this sentence before rolling around, hugging the blood-soaked body. The deceased's head had been thrown far away to the side.</p>
<p>For a long while, she remained silent. Most of the relatives and neighbors who had gathered to watch secretly wiped away tears. No one spoke, watching Aunt Shao Yun collapse beside the corpse.</p>
<p>"What's going on?" The clan chief ran out from the crowd and kicked Aunt Shao Yun forcefully. "Aren't you getting up yet? Who told you to raise such an unfilial son?"</p>
<p>Aunt Shao Yun stared blankly, unable to speak.</p>
<p>"Bring water!" The clan chief ordered.</p>
<p>With a gentle spray, Aunt Shao Yun began to cry again.</p>
<p>"My son!..."</p>
<p>"Don't cry!" The clan chief threatened. "There are still two deputy masters waiting for your reply!"</p>
<p>Aunt Shao Yun truly dared not cry out loud anymore. She stared at the clan chief. "The deputy masters say," the clan chief raised his voice, "according to the regulations of the headquarters... for each local prisoner executed, there is a headsman's fee of twenty yuan..."</p>
<p>"Headsman's fee?" Aunt Shao Yun was stunned again. She didn't even have enough money for Chun Sheng's coffin.</p>
<p>"Also," the clan chief continued, "Chun Sheng was imprisoned for twenty-three days, with a daily food cost of three jiao, totaling nine yuan and nine jiao. The total cost, including the headsman's fee, is thirty yuan. You must hand it all over to the deputy masters to take away!"</p>
<p>Aunt Shao Yun was even more speechless. She got up and kowtowed three times to the clan chief.</p>
<p>"Clan Elder Chang San, where am I going to get the money? I don't even have money for Chun Sheng's coffin yet..."</p>
<p>"Who told you to raise such an unfilial son?"</p>
<p>Aunt Shao Yun's heart felt like it was about to explode. She wanted to bite the clan chief, but...</p>
<p>"Don't have it?" The two militiamen also stood up. "Then you can hand over a relative for us to take away first! We'll release him when your money arrives... "</p>
<p>"Clan Elder Chang San!"</p>
<p>The clan chief shook his head repeatedly.</p>
<p>"There's nothing I can do!"</p>
<p>So, her younger son, Tai Sheng, was dragged out of the crowd by the militiamen.</p>
<p>"Go!" The militiamen struck Tai Sheng's unwilling legs; then turned back to Aunt Shao Yun. "Please send the money quickly, or it will be another three jiao a day!"</p>
<p>Aunt Shao Yun had completely gone mad. She shouted at the clan chief, she cried to the heavens, she rolled around hugging her eldest son Chun Sheng's corpse.</p>
<p>The relatives and neighbors all shed tears of sorrow.</p>
<p>At night, the relatives and neighbors came to help her prepare her eldest son for burial. For her younger son, for the thirty yuan headsman's fee and food expenses, Aunt Shao Yun became more and more distraught.</p>
<p>Heavens!</p>
<p>Finally... she hanged herself in the middle of the night!</p>
<p>September of the twenty-second year, the third anniversary of my aunt's death.</p>

<p>— By Henri de Régnier, translated by Li Wanjv</p>
<p>Every day during tea time, I saw the Tourlans sitting in the lobby of the hotel, always in those two old seats not far from the door. This door seemed to interest Mr. Tourlan very much. Around six o'clock, the door opened; the porter came in with the mail and placed a bundle of newspapers in front of Mr. Tourlan, and he quickly grabbed them. How quickly he tore off the seal and unfolded the large printed sheets! ... As he quickly looked at the newspaper, his wife attentively watched him. Sometimes Mr. Tourlan would hand a newspaper to her and point out a few lines of news for her to read. This couple amazed me every time I saw this scene. Who was this Mr. Tourlan, so concerned with current events? Did some people in the world really have nothing to do with everything except for the memories of lost happiness!</p>
<p>However, the stay in Riva gradually made me feel depressed, and I decided to continue my journey. The day before departure, I rented a small boat and spent some time on the lake. I felt that the sound of the oars seemed to soothe my pain and annoyance. I didn't return to the hotel until tea time. As I stepped into the main hall, the porter was handing a bundle of newspapers to Mr. Tourlan. He had only unfolded one and read a few words when I saw his face suddenly turn pale. His hands trembled. A violent emotion completely disturbed him. Suddenly, he stood up and went out. Mrs. Tourlan followed him. The newspaper remained on the table. I walked over. It was a "Political News" section. The front page had a large headline describing a tumultuous parliamentary meeting. The Foreign Minister gave a speech that resulted in the downfall of the cabinet. Some external difficulties led to this cabinet change, which also meant a political upheaval affecting the whole country.</p>
<p>Neither Mr. nor Mrs. Tourlan came out for dinner. After finishing my meal, I went to the lakeside to smoke a cigarette. The weather at night was warm and gentle, and I listened to the sound of the rippling waves for a long time, and watched a round yellow full moon slowly rise from the horizon. After I finished my cigarette, I walked back to the hotel. In the main hall, there were two Englishmen who had just arrived that morning, drinking "whiskey." I didn't wake the dozing porter, and climbed the wide stairs, walked along the corridor that passed in front of the Tourlans' room and led directly to my bedroom. As I approached their room, I faintly heard some excited, unusual voices. I stopped and listened carefully. It was Mr. Tourlan's voice, but his voice had changed, becoming rough and loud. The silent space was filled with the echoes of this voice. It was the tone of a speaker, an orator, magnificent, practiced, and uttered to incite the masses. I can assure you... in this desolate and deserted inn, hearing such a voice from behind this closed door was indeed a strange thing.</p>

Although there was a brief dip at one point, it was able to remain steady because banks took the opportunity to buy at low prices. Reuters reported that Roosevelt's speech did not mention the currency policy that the country eagerly awaited.

Consequently, the price of gold rose, but did not exceed the large threshold of eighty yuan because banks came in to sell. The afternoon market was extremely calm, with limited fluctuations. However, because people's confidence had been strengthened and rumors were favorable, it was ultimately able to break through the eighty yuan mark.

Yuan Mao Yong, Zheng Chang, Yuan Sheng Yong, Xiang He, and Zhi Feng Yong all bought, and it rose to eighty-one yuan and nine jiao (Ren Fa Yong had previously bought two yuan). HSBC sold a December US dollar at zero six two five. Hong Li, Fu Chang, Da De Cheng, Wan Xing, and others sold to zero one jiao, but the bank still wanted the January US dollar at three one two five. Shun Li Heng Yu took the opportunity to buy. The closing was at seven hundred eighty-one yuan and five jiao.

<p>—Issuing New Bonds Does Not Conflict At All—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange and the market in general were quite firm and rising, and did not fall due to the issuance of 100 million in new bonds.

The market instead rose due to short covering, although the amount was limited, the trend was extremely stable. The morning opening indicated a slight decrease in troop reduction bonds, followed by short covering or new long positions in issues 31, 38, and 47, and the market price gradually turned firm. After noon, the demand from large accounts remained undiminished, and prices rose across the board. Consolidated tax futures rose by as much as six jiao, and the rest also rose by three or four jiao. In the afternoon, the market price was slightly mixed due to some profit-taking by long positions. Generally, the market was firm before the opening and weak afterward, and weak before the closing and firm afterward, with limited fluctuations. The possibility of a continued upward trend remained.

<p>The New China Trading Company reported that on the 4th, the New York stock market rose by as much as six points because courageous speculators drove their favorite securities upward. Moreover, it was believed that there were many short positions in the market, coupled with good business reports, increased steel and electricity production, and more stable currency. Those who had given up hope for inflation now believed that a stable dollar was beneficial to long positions, so for all of the above reasons, the market rose before the expected correction. The total volume of trading for the day was 2,230,000 shares. The resistance shown by [wheat] was quite noteworthy, with increased buying. Good news seemed likely to appear. The situation in the [cotton] market was strong in the spot market, with continued increases in forward purchases.

<p>The yarn market is trending firm, and the situation is slightly stable. Because the cotton market has risen, the interdependent yarn market is supported.

<p>Zhenjiang 10, Northern Guild 5</p>
<p>The cotton market is rising, and the situation is quite strong. The upward trend in October is becoming more intense. Because the weather is bad, general retailers are dumping too much. Sellers in the market are panicking, and only buyers are active, so the market price is trending higher and higher. However, the spot market price outside is still flat. At the time of the new cotton entering the market, there is a squeeze. This situation is rare throughout history. In fact, there are excessive short positions, so there is this contradictory phenomenon.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the U.S. cotton market was quiet and firm. Wall Street was powerful, and the same industry was buying and rising. As a result, spot prices rose by ten pounds and futures prices rose by nine pounds to twelve pounds. Liverpool cotton spot prices fell by three points, near-term prices fell by one point, and far-term prices were unchanged. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by seven points. The Bombay cotton market was firm at first due to short covering, but then fell due to profit-taking by long positions and selling by speculators. As a result, Pinga'er Aomu La both fell by two and a half jiao, and Bairoxi fell by one rupee, three and seven and a half fen. The original telegram is on the left (4th electricity).</p>

<p>New York, 4th. The Fuxike Bureau's estimate of the current new cotton is 62.3 percent of the normal annual production, totaling 11,750,000 bales, an increase of 67,000 bales compared to the last estimate (September 6). Also, the Commercial Daily's estimate of the current new cotton is 65.4 percent of the normal annual production, totaling 11,710,000 bales, an increase of 630,000 bales compared to the last estimate (September 6).</p>
<h3 id="e265">Grain New Top-Grade Rice Arrives, Prices Drop by More Than One Jiao <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) More than 70 boats arrived for various guilds, of which new top-grade rice accounted for two-thirds, while broken japonica rice was still scarce. Therefore, although the retail market is more active than before the festival, there is too much new top-grade rice arriving, and supply cannot meet demand, and the price has fallen by more than one jiao. Broken japonica rice is scarce and quite popular, although the order volume is not much, only 400 to 500 bags, its market price has risen by nearly one chi. De-Yin-Yuan goods are in short supply and continue to be popular, with a price increase of two jiao. New japonica rice is average, neither good nor bad. All Qingjiao Yaozhong Sijing Red Rice Fengjing Baige Xintai Baige have now been listed, and today is still the first day. The market color is quite popular. The prices of Yaozhong and Red Rice are each opened at 7 yuan and 7 jiao, while Baige is opened at 7 yuan and 3 jiao to 2 jiao and a half.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There are about 40 sources, and the market sales are average. The market situation is that high-quality broken japonica rice, western new japonica rice, and Bai Yuan are tightly rising by nearly one chi. New Yangbu Dujian Kejian, Bo Rice, Chen Yang Dujian Kejian have not risen or fallen much. The price of East New Japonica rice has increased by two jiao. New Yaozhong has now been listed, and the price is opened at 8 yuan and 4 jiao to 7 yuan and 6 jiao to 7 jiao.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Head Rice Arrivals Are Strong, and All Wheels Are Prosperous <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of head rice was very strong, and Yangtze River trains were all loaded. The market originally had a continuous downward trend, but this batch of arrivals was all transported after the price increase in Shanghai, and the cost was already high. It was difficult to make a profit according to the market, so many were sold at a limited price, and the market was subsequently rejected. Subsequently, merchants in this street took the opportunity to buy small amounts, and the Guangdong guild also had purchases, and the appetite was slightly stronger than before. Fuzhou and Ningbo both had inquiries, and the market turned to a flat station situation. A total of 1,500 bags of Hunan unpolished Jing were sold out, priced at 5 yuan and 7 jiao to 5 yuan and a half, and were divided up by this street and the Guangdong guild. The Fuzhou guild continued to purchase 370 bags of Nanjing machine rice, priced at 6 yuan and 6 jiao and a half to 5 jiao and 7 fen. The Ningbo guild took 150 bags of Jiaxing Yangjian, priced at 7 yuan and 5 jiao and 2 fen. There were no other imports or exports. The market price of foreign rice followed suit, but the owners rejected it, and there was still no transaction.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Sharp Short Selling, Both Flour and Wheat Fall <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>After hearing the market report in the morning, the market situation for each month still showed a smart appearance. Foreign wheat quotations fluctuated in and out for two days, but the result was little change. When it first opened, people's sentiment was still flat. Subsequently, because of a part of the non-industry floating long, it was reported that a part of the factories would be forced to stop production, and the standard situation was feared to be driven. Therefore, they took advantage of the situation to purchase, and floating shorts also covered, so the market situation for each month compared to the rebound of one fen and zero. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, the smart trend of a flash in the pan suddenly plunged, with a great potential to fall without end. Large and small factories sold together, and the quantity was quite huge, while the recipients were extremely indifferent. Therefore, the lowest new record was discovered in this month, falling to one jiao and a half. The sluggish fatigue of the flour market is actually due to the large reduction in sales, the low price of rice, and the accumulation of flour in each factory, which is becoming larger and larger, so even if they want to maintain it, there is no proper way. This kind of environment cannot be changed in a short time. As a result, this month fell by one fen and two and a half li, November and December fell by one fen and two and a half li, January fell by one fen and a half, February fell by one fen and two and a half li, and March fell by one fen.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, each month only showed a hovering situation. Foreign wheat quotations did not rise or fall much in two days. As for the non-industry floating long, although the environment was not good, they still thought of rejecting it hard, so the opening price of each month was only hovering and not moving forward. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, it was still stable at first. Subsequently, because the flour market was not good, the degree of decline exceeded the morning's rise, so the selling households in the long term became surging, and this foreign wheat pricing was close, and the multi-party was even less hopeful. There was no reason why it was not easy to attract buyers. As a result, this month fell by three fen, November fell by four fen, December fell by three fen, and January and February fell by five fen. The current wheat has been rejected for several days. Yesterday, because Huafeng moved slightly, it reluctantly opened. It is estimated that Qingjiangpu wheat is 3 yuan and 9 jiao and 6 fen, Yaowan wheat is 3 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, followed by 9 jiao, Yangzhou wheat is 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 3 fen, Gaoyou wheat is 3 yuan and 6 jiao, followed by 5 jiao and 8 fen, totaling 1,400 bags.</p>

<p>Since the new soybeans of Jinpu Road have been listed, the situation is still stable. Recently, although there have been inquiries from exporting and this street, the eating price is quite tight, so the market situation has been reduced by two or three jiao compared to the previous selling price. However, the source is still not enthusiastic, and the situation is temporarily in a situation of raising high and killing low. Yesterday, the market sold six cars of car beans, which were taken by Fuzhou and Wenzhou guilds on this street.</p>

<p>Wuhu Communication. According to the customs trade register, the export of rice and grain from southern Anhui is estimated to be as much as 15 to 16 million shi per year by private boats to Jiangsu and Zhejiang. In addition, the miscellaneous grains produced in northern and central Anhui are not included. Although there have been repeated floods in recent years, there is still a surplus. However, due to the establishment of rice donations in Anhui Province, exports have been restricted, and Anhui rice sales have always been dominated by Guangdong, Chaozhou, Ningbo, and Yantai. Since the intrusion of foreign rice, Anhui rice has been greatly affected. This year's harvest is very rich, and the initial lack of outlet and the cheap price of shells have become even worse. Recently, since the Guangdong provincial government resolutely levied import duties on foreign rice, the Guangdong and Chaozhou rice industry in Wuhu has let go of procurement, and the dead rice market has been greatly activated. The market finance has also gradually become active. In the past half month, large quantities of rice and grain have been concentrated in Wuhu from Xuanzhou and Nanling. Therefore, there are many stocks here, and the daily shipping exports are always in the range of 15 to 16 thousand bags. It is expected that after the Mid-Autumn Festival, when the money market is loose, the exports will be several times this number. The recent rice prices are as follows: top machine rice is 4 liang and 3 qian, second machine rice is around 4 liang and 2 qian to 4 liang and 1 qian, top unpolished rice is between 3 liang and 7 qian and 5 qian, and top colored rice is 2 yuan and 3 jiao or 4 jiao (3rd).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market turned firm due to the increase in customs duty and the micro-shrinkage of the Dutch exchange rate. The association's division of the market called for an increase of five fen for ordinary grade sand white of the 24th group, to 21 yuan and 6 jiao and a half. This was not achieved. There was no great change in No. 20 medium sand and Hechi. Taikoo Sugar called for an increase of five fen, with B-mark at 21 yuan and 7 jiao. Zhonghua Guohua cotton white top number was 20 yuan and 8 jiao and a half, and No. 1 was 20 yuan and 6 jiao and a half, with the rest according to retreat. Yesterday, more than a thousand bags of Chaoqing continued to arrive. It is estimated that more than 300 bags of Longgangqing will be sold out, at 14 yuan and 9 jiao and a half to 9 jiao. There was a slight transaction in unified hand ice sugar, at 16 yuan and 8 jiao per zhui.</p>

<p>This year's Shima sun-dried longan is due to the poor harvest of longan, and the number of exports is small. The initial market land price was 75 yuan. Some insiders purchased it and sold it for more than 90 yuan. It is heard that the land price has risen by 20 yuan before and after. The application must be more than 100 yuan.

<p>(Shanghai Silk Factories Are Shutting Down One After Another) There are a total of 113 single and double palace silk factories in Shanghai. Since the government has taken measures to provide relief, a total of 63 have started operations this spring. Since entering the autumn, European and American silk sales have returned to sluggishness, and silk prices have plummeted. The price of B-grade white factory silk is less than 700 yuan, plus foreign firms are nitpicking and scrutinizing silk harshly, reducing prices and returning goods at every turn, causing the operating silk factories to be unable to support themselves and shut down one after another. 15 factories had already shut down before the Mid-Autumn Festival, and another three factories have shut down after the festival and are still lacking preparations for resumption of work. It is currently estimated that there are only 45 silk factories operating in the Chinese and French Concessions.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Are Unlikely to Improve) Since entering autumn, artificial silk sales in this port have been difficult to progress.

However, most of the goods traded were pure second and third batch sub-teas, and the quality was not good, and the selling price was also cheaper than before. As for Zhenmei Green Flower, Tunxi, Suian and other goods have been lacking, and the source of worker colored tea, Yihe and Long and other firms have large amounts under negotiation.

<h3 id="e274">Diplomas and Bread <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Han</p>
<p>It is no accident that diplomas are related to bread.</p>
<p>A person steps from home into school, what about the Book of Poetry? What about ABCD? What about three plus six equals nine? Vaguely, muddling through so many years; the fathers and brothers at home spent several hundred or several thousand dollars, fulfilling a wish to cultivate their children; from the principal to the teachers and staff to the tea boy in the school, everyone received a salary, and also unloaded some of the responsibility of educating students; and we ourselves, obtained a paper diploma that we had been dreaming of, and also fulfilled the obligation of studying hard. Everyone achieved perfect merit and everything was auspicious!</p>
<p>When a person with a diploma rolls from school into society, the first thing to do is to make a living. Making a living is another name for grabbing bread. Thus, diplomas become related to bread. A certain cigarette paper shop wants to hire apprentices, the level must be elementary school graduation; a certain company wants to recruit clerks, the knowledge must be middle school graduation; a certain bookstore intends to hire editors, the qualification must be university graduation. The so-called level, knowledge, and qualification, the representative object is of course the diploma.</p>
<p>Because eating bread requires a diploma, the things of society cheating diplomas, buying diplomas, forging diplomas, and selling diplomas arise in response to the times. In order to supply social demand.</p>
<p>But having a diploma does not necessarily mean having bread to eat. Under these circumstances, the diploma inevitably becomes an unfulfilled piece of waste paper. It is useless to hide it, and it is a pity to abandon it, and it is like chicken ribs. There are various reasons for having a diploma but not being able to eat bread... supply exceeds demand in society, not being good at promotion, lacking traction, no background, having a real diploma but no real skills, etc.</p>
<p>Indeed. It is no accident that diplomas are related to bread.</p>
<h3 id="e275">A Farce of Solving the Problem of Eating <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Li Li</p>
<p>The problem of eating is the most important and urgent problem for anyone who wants to eat and can eat. We who rely on school life may not have to find food ourselves to have food to eat—because we have not entered the path of adulthood and cannot be economically independent, we can open our mouths to eat our parents' blood and sweat, like chicks waiting to be fed. We are still young!? For us commuting students, lunch is a problem that can become a problem. Although the mother cooks the rice early and smiles as she waits for us to go back and gobble it up. But, the journey is far and it is too inconvenient to go back and forth! Let's have lunch at school? It is really difficult to get used to the tasteless rice and vegetables, so eating becomes a problem!</p>
<p>In the first few days, we brought some bread and biscuits to fill our hungry stomachs, but the sweet and dry taste was really difficult to swallow, so we desperately drank water, and forcibly poured the bread and biscuits into our throats like the Yellow River bursting its banks.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of an old classmate, we asked the school janitor to buy wontons, noodles and other kinds of wet snacks to chew on in the classroom—because the girls are tender-faced, it is very embarrassing to be seen by the teachers in the dining hall—together to promote, everyone followed suit, so the classroom became a dining hall... [Spoons and chopsticks qi Hong, sipping soup and sucking noodles correspond.]</p>
<p>When the number of people increased, it was inevitable to be slow, and often the class bell had already rung, and there were still people eating at the table. When they heard the bell ringing, they were shocked and at a loss, spilling soup and dropping chopsticks in a mess. If the cow is stubborn, it will go to the door. Is there an elegant small seat in the secluded inclined bridge for you to drink slowly? Only that small noodle restaurant in the style of a two-meat shop, buying wontons, steamed buns, no rice—this is where the working class solves the problem of eating, cheap and plentiful—the taste is not good—a bowl of old noodles for twelve copper yuan, a bowl of wontons for ten copper yuan, and a meat filling steamed bun for three copper yuan, which cannot be turned into two maos, and after eating three patterns, the stomach can be filled to the brim to go back.</p>
<p>Honestly, this dirty and narrow little noodle restaurant, I wouldn't even look at it on weekdays, let alone eat anything. But in desperation, there is no way, can't solve the problem of eating, and can't stand the meat riot—hunger—we finally stepped into this short, narrow and unclean little noodle restaurant, relying on the large number of people to cover our faces, and it didn't feel embarrassing, so you want wontons, I want noodles, he wants soup, and we yelled for a while like a hundred birds singing. We sat down on the narrow and crowded long bench, picked up the rough and unpolished Maozhu chopsticks, held up the blue flower coarse porcelain bowl, and ate it with a hula hula sound, which was also unique. The deserted and dirty little noodle restaurant, decorated with a group of innocent and lively little angels, is so lively, brilliant and energetic, attracting the attention of passersby.</p>
<p>This is the time for lunch. The working class, who solved the problem of eating in the small noodle restaurant, dragged their tired and heavy bodies into the small noodle restaurant as usual. The familiar table and benches with holes in the blue cloth shirt and trousers were replaced by white shirts and black skirts, which was a miracle for them. They scanned us with lost and suspicious eyes, sat down at the table near the door, and asked for a bowl of noodles with three additions—the three additions were pickled vegetables—and finished it in a whirlwind. This small bowl of noodles probably cannot fill the dry stomach that has been squeezed by labor. Annoyed, I stared at them blankly, letting the white air rising above the wontons slowly lower.</p>
<p>A delicate (?) young lady is eating with the rude (?) working class. Is it a strange phenomenon in the current society where class concepts have not been broken?</p>

<p>— Unknown</p>
<p>I can't recall which year it was, but it was an autumn time when the plantain trees were green and the air crisp.</p>
<p>Home—in the floating of the night, a small corner of a cramped, dim pavilion. Ah Shun's mother, an elderly woman with a bald spot and thinning white hair, sat alone under the dim light of a kerosene lamp, hunched over, her back curved. Her ten withered fingers stitched away at Ah Shun's worn-out, earth-toned short coat, the sleeve of which was torn. Fatigue had seized the elderly woman's deeply wrinkled, pale face. Her unnatural yawns… labored coughs; faint sighs, intermittent at the edges of her bloodless lips, sounded like a low, fragmented, chaotic dirge at the bottom of the night!</p>
<p>It was midnight! On the deserted streets, the sound of footsteps was rarely heard in the stillness.</p>
<p>[Ah Shun, go to sleep early. Uncle San will come first thing tomorrow morning to take you to the XX store!] The elderly woman's voice, like cracking bamboo, urged.</p>
<p>Sleep, young Ah Shun thought… as if it were something he didn't need right now! Although his eyelids felt as if they were being weighed down by something heavy, he ultimately didn't want his mother to be doing work alone in the dimness of night.</p>
<p>[Sleep! Ah Shun,] the elderly woman urged impatiently, eventually causing him to wrinkle his brow, leave his mother's embrace, go to bed, close his eyes, and toss and turn, unable to sleep.</p>
<p>Worried feelings, sorrowful experiences, in his complex memories, stirred up deep melancholy! He thought… years of unconscious drifting, wandering! Everything seemed to be dyed a deep gray! Tears, these seemingly familiar tears, on the pillow, in Ah Shun's eyes, uncontrollably flowed! Each one like a clear, mixed pearl carrying a bitter smile!</p>
<p>The next morning, Uncle San had already arrived at his home.</p>
<p>[Uncle San, good morning, please sit,] the sleepy-eyed elderly woman wiped the dust off the stool, poured a cup of scalding hot tea from the hot water vendor for Uncle San from the table, a slight smile on the corners of her eyes, yet the elderly woman's deeply wrinkled, pale face looked even more [feeble]! Her fleshless cheeks, protruding, frightening cheekbones, and somewhat dry ears, like a crisscrossing outline, clearly hinted at the onset of an eye disease.</p>
<p>[Alright, Ah Shun's mother,] Uncle San stretched in a long yawn.</p>
<p>The elderly woman stared earnestly at Ah Shun's thin body moving before her.</p>
<p>[Ah Shun, when you get there, you must listen to people!] she said…</p>
<p>[You should soften your temper a little!]</p>
<p>[Your…]</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>[Mom, I understand everything, don't worry!] Ah Shun's childish heart, emotionally, simply couldn't speak.</p>
<p>Leaving home, stepping lightly on the sidewalk.</p>
<p>The dawn of the metropolis, in the roars of the tall factory chimneys, crawled out of the dark grave, spitting flames of light.</p>
<p>Carrying a worn-out mat, a bundle, an old cotton quilt tied with hemp rope, these things, in Ah Shun's resurrected life, began to become acquainted with [new companions].</p>
<p>XX Store was the most famous department store on a bustling street in X Port.</p>
<p>There, from the time of [opening the gate] in the morning to the time of [closing shop] in the evening, fifteen hours were spent living the rigid life of a [shop assistant], with no opportunity to engage in lofty discussions. Although business at XX Store was sometimes relatively slow, the clever and capable boss would ask you to do some extra work, such as holding his one-and-a-half-year-old precious daughter, chopping firewood, or helping with… and so on. It was a strenuous three and a half months!</p>
<p>Alas, an addict whose marrow was being squeezed out and whose body was being sold in the gears of life!</p>
<p>The principle of [fortune and misfortune] in the world is sometimes laughably contradictory. Our young Ah Shun, through his diligent and thrifty work, never dreamed that he would be unemployed!</p>
<p>It was said that the unemployment was due to laziness, but Ah Shun seemed very indignant about this misfortune. Laziness was what he hated most. He understood that his unemployment was based on the ways of the world and human relations. He couldn't flatter, couldn't brown-nose. Unfortunately, his old boss loved flattery and brown-nosing. Ah Shun had failed!</p>
<p>As he lowered his head in shame, carrying a worn-out mat, a bundle, an old cotton quilt tied with hemp rope, he felt many cold taunts and hideous glares around him, which frightened him into quickly rolling out of XX Store!</p>
<p>On the way home, he walked heavily, sluggishly, as if lacking courage, on the smooth Water Gate Road.</p>
<p>The setting sun trailed its blood-red shadow, jumping into the brocade quilt of the clouds!</p>

<p>— Ping</p>
<p>In a novel by a female writer, she said two sentences that represent the modern woman's philosophy of life: [Relying on youth and seizing pleasure] is their goal.</p>
<p>Indeed, everyone believes that in her two short aphorisms, she used camera-like vision to capture the inner workings of a segment of modern women without missing a beat, and then expressed it on paper. However, if we carefully understand these two sentences, many historical events have already proven that the philosophy of life of [relying on youth and seizing pleasure] is not only a guiding principle for a segment of modern women, but also a guiding principle for a segment of ancient women.</p>
<p>Speaking of early pleasure, as far as I personally know, there are no more than two kinds of thinking… one is spiritual enjoyment, and the other is material enjoyment. Artistic appreciation, natural response, and love's intoxication belong to the former. Pursuing carnal desire, the stimulation of smoking and drinking, and the looting of money belong to the latter.</p>
<p>If we study these shallow principles from the literal meaning alone, it seems that the enjoyment of the spirit requires a higher level than the enjoyment of material things… However, in fact, it is extremely wrong. In the whole world, everyone, regardless of whether they are male, female, old, or young, isn't opening their eyes wide, clenching their fists, and chasing desperately after the ass of material things?</p>
<p>Some philosophers believe that matter and spirit are two phenomena in the universe that are mutually causal. To seek spiritual pleasure, the first step is still to seek material satisfaction; otherwise, no matter whether you are perched on an ivory tower or leaning in the arms of a lover, you will still starve to death in three days if you are not given food to eat.</p>
<p>In our ancient Republic of China, men's status in society is more important than that of ordinary women in any field. In the present situation where education is not universal and women's occupations have not yet developed, economic power is almost entirely in the hands of men. Men can use their superior economic position to seduce women, deceive women, and make women succumb to their gold without resistance.</p>
<p>This deformed development, on the one hand, is certainly due to men's irrationality, and on the other hand, it is also due to women's excessive belief in the philosophy of life of [relying on youth and seizing pleasure], which results in a bad situation.</p>
<p>According to general opinion, a woman's youth lasts at most from the age of sixteen to twenty-six. In these short ten years, although a woman can proudly use the power of her youth to make men fall in love, admire, and achieve her goal of enjoyment, after ten years, her beautiful youth will gradually disappear with the passage of time, and in the blink of an eye, she will become an old woman with wrinkled skin and white hair. At that time, her beauty will be exhausted, and whether men still obey her will is still a question.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believe that the pleasure gained by relying on youth is absolutely unreliable. Finally, I dare to advise women who are intoxicated with this erroneous view with a sincere attitude, hoping that you will never underestimate yourselves, and that you will not ruin your whole lives for the sake of temporary pleasure. Your only way out is to rely on your own efforts and drive everything in front of men.</p>

<p>— Ning Ying</p>
<p>The only [truth] in the world is children, so they don't understand adult matters at all. At this moment, when he often saw his mother talking and laughing with an unfamiliar father, he was filled with great questions.</p>
<p>[Mom, why hasn't Daddy come home for several weeks? Mom, why did Daddy make such a big fuss that day? Mom, I haven't had any candy for a long time. Mom, buy it for me.] He just wanted to eat candy, so he said a few silly things.</p>
<p>[I'll go out tonight and buy it for you.] She tasted the flavor of preserved plums.</p>
<p>[Mom, why doesn't Daddy come home? When will he come back?] The child always kept asking to the bottom of things.</p>
<p>Her eyes turned red, and she remained silent, pretending not to hear. He seemed puzzled. Why did his mother's eyes turn red and not say anything when his father was mentioned? Why did that man who came often want me to call him Dad?</p>
<p>[Mom, why does that man who comes every night want me to call him Dad? My dad buys me candy, wears glasses, and wears clothes like foreigners. Ling'er from next door called me Dad too, and you and Dad laughed at her for having two dads? Mom, how can I have two dads?]</p>
<p>[Child, don't be nosy. You're little, you don't know.] She said shyly, as if thorns were on her back.</p>
<p>His question was still an incomprehensible question. He also remembered sleeping with his parents on that big brass bed before. Why did they make him sleep alone on the sofa now? He spoke again:</p>
<p>[Mom, how can you sleep with that man [sideways]? Didn't Dad say before that when a country cousin married a sister-in-law, the sister-in-law slept with another man in bed, and the cousin saw it, and he scolded her and beat her up! Dad said they got divorced later. Mom, what does divorce mean?]</p>
<p>[Mom, will Dad come back when school is out?] He asked again, questioning to the end.</p>
<p>At this moment, in her heart, how she had been naughty with her husband, how they had divorced in front of a lawyer, how the son had been given to her to raise, everything, like a movie projected into her eyes, plus her poor son's silly questions, she couldn't say the sour feelings! Only…</p>
<p>[Child, it's getting late. Shall we go out together to buy candy? What kind of candy do you want to buy?]</p>
<p>As soon as the child heard about the candy, he forgot everything and shouted as he jumped…</p>
<p>[Mom, I want to eat chocolate candy.]</p>
<p>[Ah!] In her answering voice, she led her son out of the door. He jumped and ran, already reaching the entrance of the alley. Suddenly, he saw his father wearing glasses and a Western suit like a foreigner. He hurriedly walked away without looking back. He went up, grabbed the corner of his father's clothes, and his active, clear little voice filled the air…</p>
<p>[Dad, why haven't you come back for a long time?] Then he quickly turned his head and shouted to his mother…</p>
<p>[Mom, Dad is back. Ask Dad to buy my chocolate candy.]</p>

<p>— Zhiqin</p>
<p>Unemployment is a common occurrence in life and an experience that should be had in the workplace. There is nothing to be surprised about or to be depressed about. Although encountering unemployment is an unfortunate thing, if you can use the period of unemployment to cultivate yourself, reflect on yourself, and it is easy to find past mistakes, you can quickly improve yourself and easily achieve significant progress. When you encounter an opportunity for employment in the future, you will be able to receive better treatment and happiness. The so-called "one who eats bitterness among bitterness becomes a man above men." I am a person who has experienced unemployment. The difficulties and hardships during the period of unemployment are, of course, no exception. The reason why I am now able to regain my employment is partly due to the help and introduction of friends, and partly due to my own efforts to cultivate myself during the period of unemployment. Friends who are unemployed, do you feel the pain of unemployment? Do you want to get a better job than before in the future? If so, then please pay attention to the following points.</p>
<p>First, during the period of unemployment, you must not be discouraged by unemployment, nor can you engage in bad pastimes because you are idle.</p>
<p>Second, often reflect on past wrongs, correct them, and repent.</p>
<p>Third, often read books that are beneficial to your desired profession to make up for insufficient academic ability.</p>
<p>Fourth, endure the pain of unemployment and develop good habits of calming down.</p>
<p>Unemployment is not absolutely unfortunate. If we can use the period of unemployment to cultivate ourselves, it is indeed a new opportunity for the unemployed. I deeply hope that compatriots who have been hit by unemployment will remember my words and put them into practice, so that what is lost in the east will be gained in the west, and we can wait and see.</p>

<p>— Ling Hong</p>
<p>Act Three: Ode to Peace</p>
<p>Financial Tycoon: Yes, every time the military and political authorities in North China raised funds, I have always been very dutiful. I am a very upright person. If I can do it, I will say I can do it, and do my best until I say I can't do it. Then there is definitely no way to do it. So when the minister talked to me about this issue the other day, I said there was no way, and there is still no way now.</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: That's right. When Young Marshal Zhang was here, Mr. Zhang's efforts for the financial affairs of North China were truly admirable. Now, if Mr. Zhang is still willing to work for the government like that, I think it would be easy for Mr. Zhang to raise not only 20 million, but even more, 50 million, 100 million.</p>
<p>Peace Negotiator: Haha, that's right, that's right! Mr. Zhang's financial skills are well known and admirable!</p>
<p>Financial Tycoon: Thank you, Minister, and everyone for your praise. I am very ashamed. There is really no way to issue the 20 million war bonds this time. It is not that we doubt the government's credit, but that the banking industry in Tianjin can't come up with the money. No one will underwrite them. This is a matter of fact, not that I am unwilling to help.</p>
<p>Military Authority: Hey, I think this must be clarified. This is definitely not a matter of helping the government, but of doing things for yourselves. Why? The government has long been determined to resist Japan, even if it means one soldier at a time, and will continue to resist for a long time. Has Mr. Zhang forgotten? This request for a truce was first proposed by your banking industry, not that the government had the determination to stop the war first. If you now insist on saying that you are helping the government, then we don't have to truce; let's continue to see which side loses the most? Besides, it is the duty of our soldiers to defend our homeland and sacrifice our lives for the country. Are we afraid of resisting Japan? What a joke!</p>
<p>Entrepreneur: However, as far as I know, military setbacks are also one of the main reasons for the hasty truce. As the minister just said, we don't need to suffer unnecessary sacrifices.</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: So, Mr. Liu means that our soldiers were the first to ask for a truce? That's a joke. Mr. Liu has always had great vision. Can Mr. Liu's cotton yarn still be as prosperous as before if we continue to fight like this and the market is so depressed? This is a very obvious fact.</p>
<p>Entrepreneur: Since Secretary He said so, then I have a very good reason to answer him. Yes, the market is depressed, which affects the development of Chinese industry, but on the other hand, from the standpoint of our industry, we can very well endure the current wartime sacrifices. Because we hope to expand this national war, and even recover the lost territory in the Northeast and take back our original market. At the same time, as the war continues, the boycott of foreign goods will naturally continue, which is of course an excellent opportunity for our industry. However, in fact, things cannot go as we wish. To be honest, Chinese soldiers cannot yet bear the heavy responsibility of protecting and developing national capital; although it is the duty of Chinese soldiers to defend the country. This is an ironclad fact that cannot be concealed by strong arguments. As for expanding overseas markets to foreign countries, it is even more of a dream for us. It is precisely because of this that it is better to stop in time and take another breath to prolong our lives. We cannot express our bitterness.</p>

<p>— Mr. Huang Binhong's Calligraphy (Brief Biography)</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Binhong has been touring famous mountains and rivers in recent years to enhance his poetry and painting drafts. Last autumn, he entered Sichuan and went up the river, passing through the Qutang and Wu Gorges to Bayu, and then went to Jiading via Luzhou and Xuzhou to climb Mount Emei to view the snow-capped mountains and the beauty of red leaves. He stayed in Chengdu for several months and had the opportunity to see a large number of ancient objects in public and private collections. In the spring and summer, he went to Qingcheng, climbed Xuanyuan Peak, came out of Guanxian, and viewed the Dujiangyan irrigation project where the river is divided and dikes are built. He passed Longquanyi, crossed the Jialing River, went down the Qu River, and returned to Chongqing from Hechuan. He returned to Shanghai from Sichuan and gained more than a hundred poems and nearly two hundred paintings. The other day, I went to visit Mr. Meng and was allowed to publish several landscape paintings of Sichuan, all of which are realistic works by the teacher.</p>

<h3 id="e282">Interview with Chinese Film Artists (8) (Continued from the 3rd of this month) <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Shaqi</p>
<h3 id="e283">(4) [Vitality] Director Shao Zuiweng (Part 1) <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>When mentioning this gentleman, I think all readers will be very interested. [Why?] If you ask like that… then I will say… [Have you seen [Vitality]?] Indeed, this work, [Vitality], is truly unforgettable for us.</p>
<p>Because of this, when I went to visit him, I subconsciously paid attention to him. I don't know if you have seen him, but I think it is easy for you to find a characteristic on his face… When his face is full of smiles, look! His left eye is big and his right eye is small. To put it jokingly, if Mr. Shao is willing to [sacrifice his looks] to star in a movie, as long as he has those eyes, I think he is very suitable to play a villain role.</p>
<p>For the sake of the readers' time and the value of the Shen Bao's space, the following is a record of his conversation. In a reception room full of film stills, he sat in front of me smiling, speaking Mandarin with a Ningbo accent…</p>
<p>[As far as the current style of Chinese films is concerned, most of them expose the darkness of the present society without seeking any solutions. In other words, they specialize in destruction without trying to build. As everyone knows, China today cannot withstand any more destruction. Therefore, I personally feel that Chinese films should be changed, should be improved, should be constructive, and should not talk about love. This has been concretely expressed since [Vitality].</p>
<p>[For example, in [Auspicious Land], which I am now starting to produce, it tells the story of a farmer who has a piece of land that is very good for farming, and a wealthy man wants to buy it at a high price. The farmer naturally cannot bear to move the bones of his ancestors buried in the ground. However, he is not superstitious. He wants the rich man to fund the construction of a small river to divert lake water into the village to save the drought as an exchange condition. This means breaking superstition and seeking benefits for everyone. Now that the countryside is so bankrupt, we should strive to build. This is my principle… to improve without destroying.]</p>
<p>From these simple words, we can easily see Mr. Shao's entire thought. Indeed, Chinese society is already so corrupt, shouldn't we build? This is absolutely true. But in theory, there should be destruction of the old before there is new construction. It is like rebuilding a house from the ground up. If we just repair [improve] the existing one, then the house with the shaky foundation will not be as safe as a rock after all. The so-called [improving without destroying] will inevitably waste the good intentions of benevolent gentlemen. However, in his position, he should say this, which we can prove in the following words.</p>
<p>[The Tianyi Company was founded entirely by me personally with my own capital,] he said… [Ten years ago, the capital was 10,000 yuan, and then it gradually increased to 100,000 yuan, plus 70,000 to 80,000 yuan in working capital. Now, including all kinds of assets, the total value is estimated to be about 500,000 yuan. In fact, it is making money. Tianyi Company has a characteristic, which is that it does not owe debts. For example, all materials are purchased with cash, which is a phenomenon that other film companies do not have.] (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e284">Review of [Death Ray] Chandu the Magician <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Resident of Nanjing</p>
<p>The development of modern science is gradually eliminating the idealist concepts of religion and other superstitious beliefs. Therefore, all literature and art that emerge based on the spirit of science should relentlessly exclude all non-scientific elements in their themes and plots.</p>
<p>The true purpose of scientific inventions is to help humanity further overcome nature, that is, to create benefits for humanity. However, a small number of world rulers have used science – scientific inventions – to create wars and slaughter innocent people. The current race among imperialist countries to build warships, airplanes, and chemical industries is a clear example of using science to kill people. Therefore, under the war preparations of various imperialist countries, scientists are also constantly inventing all kinds of killing weapons, from tanks to poison gas. It is said that the death ray has also been invented.</p>
<p>Fox Company adopted such an invention event to produce a film. In principle, this should be a product that is imbued with the spirit of modern science, but in fact, it is far from it. The inventor of the death ray in the story initially gives us the image of an electrical engineer, surrounded by completely mechanized models. But in another place, there are many elements of ["Ghost-Obsessed Zhang Tianshi"]. We see magicians performing rope ascension, invulnerability to fire, and other Taoist magic, and Chandu returning home on a gust of wind. These two different spirits can actually be combined together. One can't help but admire the skills of the Hollywood studio bosses. But if the studio bosses of our country who made ["Investiture of the Gods"], ["Journey to the West"], and ["Seven Swordsmen and Eight Heroes"] were to see it, they would definitely say, "Hollywood is also learning from China."</p>
<p>The story does not have any special structure. It simply uses many dangerous and astonishing scenes to capture the audience's attention, such as Chandu's return home at the beginning, secretly going to Roxor's castle to inquire about information, the terror of many traps, Roxor's intimidation of Robert, etc. And these are all extremely bizarre. If a film uses such methods to attract people, then it is inevitably too empty and pitiful. Yes, capitalist culture is inherently extremely empty. Their authors can fabricate a story, create many thrilling encounters, and solve all these crises with vague and unverifiable magic and spells. Therefore, in the film "Death Ray," Chandu can be locked in an iron box and sink to the bottom of the Nile River, and then float to the surface and finally subdue Roxor, because he has magic. But if someone says, "Since Chandu really has the magic to subdue Roxor, why didn't he eliminate him earlier?" The answer to this question is that our clever scriptwriters will say, "He hasn't committed enough evil yet." The clever screenwriters will say, "If that were the case, there would be no movie to make."</p>
<p>The actors' expressions do not have any outstanding features. June Vlaleik, who plays the daughter, doesn't have enough terrifying expressions. The comedic characters interspersed in the play are relatively better. The son's role is not necessary in this play.</p>
<p>In summary, this film is an extremely absurd, supernatural, and unfounded product. In this scientific century, it is anti-scientific, and it intentionally or unintentionally promotes magic. Magic is its method of solving all difficulties. Through this film, it can further deepen the feudalistic concepts of the semi-colonial masses, deepen their belief in the supernatural, prevent them from progressing, prevent them from believing in science, and make them more foolish and more paralyzed, easier to use and easier to control.</p>
<h3 id="e285">Review of The Devil's Brother Tra Diavolo <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Laurel and Hardy's ability to attract audiences is unquestionable. Therefore, they have become cash cows for film producers. Now, in order to meet the urgent needs of people who are too tired of life, production has to be stepped up, and their comedies almost fill the film market.</p>
<p>Regarding their works, we always have the same feeling: superficial and lighthearted, and it is impossible to find a little more serious meaning. Compared with Charlie Chaplin or Sydney Olcott, this judgment is even more accurate. This is because their cultivation is shallow, and at the same time, life determines their will, and what the market needs is this. No, what people who are too tired of life ask of them is these superficial laughs, so they have to do it this way.</p>
<p>That being said, their works cannot withstand strict scrutiny, especially when they star in films at the same time. On the contrary, if they are purely used to create jokes, it may not be enough to increase the jokes in the work, because they can only make some superficial and boneless gags. Therefore, in this work, it is very appropriate for them to stand in the position of supporting roles and take on the task of clowns. However, there are still some absurdities, such as the smashing of the sedan chair and some of the wine cellar due to the impact of a cow. As for robbing others but being moved by the robbers and the big laugh at the back, they are all very good.</p>
<p>The protagonist, Dennis King, had a very good record in opera in the past. In this film, he plays the bandit Fra Diavolo, who is heroic and dashing. In terms of the plot, it is indeed very suitable. In addition, the aristocratic woman Selma Todd is also very capable of expressing the ugliness of an aristocratic woman, but some small details are a little too much.</p>
<p>What can we say about the story itself? Two people had their only money robbed by bandits, so they were angry and became thieves, impersonating the great bandit Fra Diavolo. Who knew they would meet this person, like the real and fake Li Kui in the Water Margin. But Diavolo did not kill them, but instead taught them to disguise themselves as servants and plot to steal the property of a certain aristocratic woman. As a result, the three were arrested and sentenced to be shot. Fortunately, fools have their own blessings, and finally a cow saved them from execution. It goes without saying that this story is far-fetched and unreasonable. For example, the capable bandit joins forces with two fools, and many soldiers with guns cannot kill a cow, which ultimately allows the prisoners to escape.</p>
<p>However, the focus of our criticism is not here, because many playwrights are not necessarily Realit, although current films should at least develop in realism. So what we are saying now is, why not bring the bandit to justice? In many American films, when they write about bandits, the result must be death under the ["selfless"] national law, or the bandit must repent and start anew, and get the national law's ["no blame for the past." But here, it is an exception to the former and the latter, and the bandits are allowed to roam freely. Then it can be explained that these bandits are robbing the rich to help the poor, but except for hearing this sentence from Hardy's mouth, it is completely absent from the screen. On the contrary, the author portrays Diavolo as suave and the fool as simple and innocent, which can win the audience's sympathy. Therefore, it is better to say that it is because they rob the rich to help the poor and should not die, than to say that they are trying their best to please the audience in order to win their sympathy.</p>
<p>However, this is an adaptation of a French opera. Whether the original play was also like this is unknown. At the same time, this adaptation of the stage play is very good, except for the scene where the bandit sings in the inn, which has a slight trace of the original play. This is of course because the film can be used very flexibly, which shows the director's brilliance. Although some of the jokes are inevitably vulgar, the tone of the whole play is indeed consistently lively and vivid. To be precise, this is a comedy that is meaningless but very interesting to perform, an opera that has no content but seeks to make the form interesting. Of course, this interest is of no value.</p>

<p>— Bolun</p>
<p>Ronald said disdainfully, "[I don't do that kind of office work]." Everyone was stunned. Ronald said to Elizabeth, "[You go and tell them]." Elizabeth reluctantly said, "[He doesn't want to do that kind of monotonous life. He's writing a novel now]." Kenneth said, "[Can't he put the novel aside for a few weeks?]" Ronald said, "[Put down my novel? That's impossible. Not even for an hour. It's my life]." Everyone was silent, but the unhappiness in their hearts was clearly written on their faces. Elizabeth's face was red, and she felt that they were too insensitive. She shouted angrily, "[He's a genius writer. If you send him out, you'll be destroying his talent!]" Kenneth said, "[Then what do we do?]" Eddie said, "[I don't understand why you're asking him to work. Doesn't he know our situation? I'm starving every day. If this goes on, I'll starve to death]." Elizabeth called out her brother's name and stood in front of him, but when she saw her brother's bloodless face, she felt heartbroken. She also felt that Ronald's suggestion was not wrong. Ronald's deep blue eyes looked at her, begging for her understanding. Elizabeth felt extremely uncomfortable. What should she do? Finally, she said to Ronald, "Ronald, we wanted to support you properly, but something happened at the factory today and I can't go back to work. Can you sacrifice for me?" Ronald sighed in resignation and asked, "[Where?]" So Stephen wrote down an address and gave it to him. Stephen added, "[Why don't you go see him now? He lives upstairs from his bookstore]." Ronald said resentfully, "[Elizabeth, I have to do this for you. Love is a trap that often harms oneself]."</p>
<p>Okay, Ronald left, and Elizabeth was extremely tired. She should stay awake, should plan how to find a job tomorrow, should wait for Ronald to come back; but she was extremely tired. She lay on the sofa and dozed off hazily. She felt Stephen standing in front of her, looking at her with a gaze of pity and love. She felt at ease, having someone as wise and brave as Stephen living in the same house; she felt in her dreams how reliable he was. She was in a daze when suddenly there was a loud bang that startled her awake. Then something seemed to roll down the stairs. Stephen rushed up the stairs in a hurry, and Douglas's big box rolled straight down, almost knocking Stephen down. When Stephen reached the top floor, Eddie was lying stiffly on the ground. Douglas said, "[I'm afraid he's dead]." Elizabeth came up immediately. She touched Eddie's face, which was as cold as ice, and the pulse on his head had also stopped. Elizabeth was shocked and shouted wildly, "[He's dead! He's dead!]" She hugged Stephen's arm tightly. Stephen wanted to push her away, but she hugged him even tighter. Stephen shouted, "[Let go!]" But Elizabeth's nerves were already deranged and she refused to let go. He used all his strength to push her away, and then opened his hand and slapped her heavily on the face. Only then did he wake her up. He silently watched Stephen gently pick Eddie up, carry him into the bedroom, and put him on the bed. (To be continued)</p>
