<p>日内瓦　十九國特委會今晨開會、認日本之新提議滿紙遁詞、不可捉摸、决函日代表團請明白答覆、下列兩問題、㈠日本是否承認中國在滿洲之主權㈡日本能否停止攻熱軍事運動、前一問題必須用書面答覆、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>日内瓦　九人起草委員會今日下午繼續討論建議草案、（九日中央社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）今晨十九國委員會舉行會議、對於日本新提議、認爲不甚確切、因於討論之後、决定向日本代表團提出兩項問題、要求用書面答覆、其一即［日本是否承認中國在滿洲之主權］、其二係口頭提出、即［日本爲表示妥協精神起見、是否準備停止進攻熱河之軍事行動、］一般人推想、日本代表團對於此兩問題、當有徵求日本政府意見之必要、十九國委員會頃已决定延會至下午五時、（九日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）九人小組會八日晨開會時、逐條討論建議案首四項、然後始議定第五項、因第五項在若干點上最關重要也、首四項據可恃消息、大旨如下、</p>

<p>第二項言及國聯對於中日爭議之　般態度、尤注重國聯盟約、此節切實說明對於條約之義務、及尊重土地完整與獨立之必要、</p>

<p>丨結果如何丨</p>
<p>（一）山窮水盡之［講理］</p>
<p>我國自九一八事變以來。即隠忍屈從以將就所謂和平公理。吾人爲和平所出之代價不可謂不大。爲公理而支付之犧牲不能謂不多東北三省延至榆關。論地積至少有三百七十八萬方里。論人口則在三千萬以上。因日軍暴行而損失之生命不下三十萬。財產損失（以我國官方向乏統計）。估期概數當超過百憶圓。據此。我國爲和平爲公理之誠意不可謂爲不充分。然而荏苒迄今。所得者如何耶。尤憶去年十二月國聯大會時。捷克瑞典愛爾蘭西班牙四國之提議對公道正義具確切認識。於今鐵拳横行時代。洵爲空谷足音也。本月六日十九國委員會對非常大會所提之建議草案最重要之點。係在事實上法律均反對承認［滿洲國。］但同時爲顧全日本起見。又以爲回復九一八事變以前原狀爲不可能。此種提議就平面觀察似乎於我有利。［公理和平。］似已得紙上之勝利。然吾人於此殊不能認爲滿足。且爲國聯過事遷就日本所謂之事實。深致惋惜。殊不知更有甚者六日　已討論告一段落漸漸一致之點。至於八日竟未着手起草。而會場空氣亦極消沉。坐待日本新提議提出後之發展。　當前東北三省之被蹂躪。山海關之流血。以致熱河之將遭兵燹於不論。而所謂新提議者撮其主要内容約有以下三點。</p>
<p>第一根據李頓報告書之精神。力求調解。</p>
<p>第二調解之基礎。須先承認［滿洲（傀儡）國］。丨［日本甚至高唱［日支滿］和恊怪論）。</p>
<p>第三調解手續須以德魯蒙杉村案爲本據。</p>
<p>否則日本即將訴諸［世界民衆］之前以求［公判］云云。嗚呼。日本之所謂［民衆］其日本軍閥心目中之貴族閥閱耶。抑已受日本軍國主義完全麻醉之盲目者耶非然者。世界上恐再無衷心贊成帝國主義之獨占侵略而助以殘酷殺人者也。然則國聯盟約明載不得以［戰爭］牽動國際和平。［非戰公約］亦謂任何國際糾紛皆不能以［戰爭］　［解决］之手段。而日本之侵略東北。擾亂上海。强奪榆關。轟炸熱邊。何一而非［戰爭。］何一而不逞其陸海軍之暴力。國際聯盟於此。竟充耳不聞。有目不見者何耶。徒以英法兩大國過於顧忌對日友好重視其眼前之利得。而忘却我國被侵略之事實也。</p>
<p>（二）大兵壓境空言公道何益</p>
<p>國際聯盟中主張以公道抑制暴力之諸友邦。如捷克如瑞典如愛爾蘭等。吾人均深致敬意。然彼皆國小力微。且又道遠莫及。縱令國聯大會容納其主張。恐亦無法可以制止日本軍國主義者之武力侵略也。矧國聯原爲英法兩大國所運用之工具。本與公理正義和平無多大關聯是故自始對中日糾紛之和平解决。即爲一種［敷衍塲面之和平］。一言以蔽之曰。［并無裁制日本决心。］雖。然國際聯盟誠曲意遷就。盡和事老之能事矣。而日本所報答國聯者則何如。一則曰國聯者歐洲之國際聯盟也。上自握政治實權之軍部。下至金融資本閥以至御用學者皆同此意。乃大倡其大亞細亞門羅主義。再則曰滿洲之於日本有特殊關係。國聯未常理解及此。於是瀋陽事變蔓延至於北滿近且禍及熱河。牽動平津矣。長此以往。日本勢非完全吞併中國不止。是故吾人則曰國際聯盟各大國因利益關係致無抑制日本暴行之决心。而日本軍閥又復明悉世界趨勢。不肯一口鯨吞中國。而爲逐步之蠶食遂有欺騙世界。玩弄國聯之企圖。蓋日本之眞意非必俗國際聯盟承認其一乎製造之［滿洲（傀儡）國］也其所大欲者乃事實上之延宕。俾便展佈其侵略網耳。國聯會員各國其勿爲日本軍國主義者所口頭倡導。之［門户開放。機會均等］所迷。須防備數年之後東北三省眞爲日本所兼併。遠東均勢之局悉爲日本所破毁。</p>
<p>我國處此［百難］當前。已往之失敗無可諱言。縱欲捨棄一切以祈求不可捉摸之和平亦不得矧日本調集大兵。如第八師團十師團。十四師團二十師團。十九師團騎兵第一旅團。以及其他各特種部隊。甚至［初年兵］皆徵調赴熱河邊境。估計人數不下十萬。其欲乘機一逞昭然若揭。此種蠻横舉動豈遠在日内瓦湖邊之國際聯盟一紙决議書所能阻遏。我國又何所取於［空言自慰。］今日禍已迫於眉睫。萬難偷安。豈容苟活。目今爲我民族生存計。惟有背城借一作最後之决鬭。</p>

<p>英皇與首相電賀英飛行家成功</p>
<p>法美飛行家將急起直追</p>
<p>（九日馬賽電）法國著名飛行家波索特羅與羅西握世界環繞飛行長距離之紀錄、二人曩嘗飛行六千五百八十七哩、茲已爲英國空軍軍官加福與尼古拉資以五十七小時又廿五分取直徑飛行五千三百四十哩之新紀錄所打破、今日聞上述二法飛行家擬即開始作直線飛行、以與加福等二人爭勝、</p>
<p>據開浦鎭消息、加福等二人所駕之飛機、昨夜降落非洲西南之華爾維斯灣、其地距出發地克蘭威飛行塲五千三百四十哩、而去開浦鎭僅八十五十哩、原擬一氣直達、但因大氣不佳、故爲謹愼計、不得不在白晝降地、二飛行家旣着陸、即入旅社以圖飽睡、二人精神健旺、修容頗整潔、絶不類曾居空中五十七小時者、</p>
<p>據加福致航空部之報告稱、一路天氣晴朗、迨抵尼其里亞、始遇濃霧、妨害飛航、高一萬三千呎之加瑪倫山、全爲雲蔽、第二夜暴雨時作、天空多雲、自動控制器因氣候惡劣之故、失其效用、後遂未用云、</p>
<p>此行航程、大約近六千哩、原定速率每小時平均九三哩三、但因尼其里亞發生滯碍、故每小時速率、須超過百哩、</p>

<p>中央八日日内瓦　裁軍會議今日下午開會、以法代表彭古有演說、即將原定我國工表顏惠慶博士之演說取消、顏代表當即離塲、以爲會議此舉、有損中國國體、蓋法國軍備甲於世界、裁軍會若尊重軍備較强之國、則其前途成功、絶少希望也、</p>

<p>互相關聯、不可分離、謂此意係以國聯會盟約第八條爲根據、此條規定、裁軍應以國家安全及在國際上所應盡之義務爲比例、而各國之特殊情形、亦須顧及之、照此意義、則裁軍當採</p>
<h3 id="c79">逐漸進行辦法 <a href="#c79" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e79" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">79</a></h3>
<p>而不必强定額數、但若以與凡爾賽和約第五部之序言與盟約第八條相配合、則普遍裁軍之諾言、即包括在内、而裁軍與安全相聯之關係、亦即樹立於此種基礎之上、彭古追述國際間</p>

<p>路透八日倫敦電航空部今日發表文告、宣布長距離飛行之成功、文中稱讚駕駛員、及飛機製造家、蓋飛行之成功、製造家與有力焉、又謂英國現握有世界航空三大紀錄、即速力·距離·高度是也、</p>
<p>速力、一九三一年九月航空中尉史台福在加爾旭每小時飛行三百五十七哩、後增至四百零七哩、</p>
<p>高度、一九三二年九月上尉恩文在白里斯托爾升高至四萬三千九百九十六呎、（在八哩以上）</p>
<p>長距離此次隊長加福與航空中尉尼古萊資所造成之新紀錄、</p>
<p>文中又稱造成新紀錄、甚有價値、因旣足證明英國航空材料之佳、更可决定何種飛機最適用於帝國遠地也、</p>
<p>部條約、或以各洲爲範圍、而訂立條約法國計劃中所建議者、即此種條約也、在軍縮會議開會之始、各國和平唯一保障、僅存於盟約第八條之規定、其中所載者、</p>
<h3 id="c82">不過限制軍備 <a href="#c82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>

<p>日本開疆拓土、攻城掠地、無論就　國主義的立場、就資本主義的立場、都不能不說是日本帝國之福、何以日本全國上下又到處聽到高呌［國難的危急呼聲、向左走的共產黨、在日本社會裏繁殖起來、誠然是有莫大的危險、使日本根本動搖、然而共產黨原來是非合法的政黨、匪特要受警察阿端嚴重的取締、并且還要受右傾各團體壓迫、即在鄉軍人會也要對牠施行龔擊、所以共產黨在日本雖然算是一個嚴重的問題、雖然對日本軍閥的統治有種種的妨害、可是事實上的表現、最多也不過給日本帝國主義統治有一種威脅、說得輕一點、只有思想上的威脅、而沒有實際行動上的叛亂、足令日本政治發生危險、然則日本之所謂國難、又在那裏呢、</p>
<p>這是誰都知道的、日本自從停止金本位制度、守行［通貨澎脹政策］以來、產業界似乎是受了物價高漲的激刺、略現活潑景色、可是一般平民生活、反而因爲物價高漲感受生活困難更大的痛苦、所以都市上［不景氣］之聲、依照到處聽得到、農村中的苦况、更是日甚一日、生活困難的壓迫、逼得農民大衆連氣也喘不過來、因此無論是工傾是右傾各種類的人、（除開軍事上層的統治者與少數的貴族、）對今日現狀都表示極端的不滿、</p>
<p>這種不滿於現狀呼聲、從一般人民以至在職的海陸軍中下級軍官、都普遍的流行着、其中最厲害而且有力的羣集作用、要算血盟團爲第一、過去一年當中、［血盟團］的確是日本的一個怪物、也是日本社會的一個難於猜透的謎、雖然我們曉得這是一個右傾團體、這是一個在軍部指揮之下活動的集體、但牠的内容何如、行動怎樣、是一般人所不知道的、</p>
<p>殊不知主持血盟團的中心人物纔　個和尙、在他指導之下除了直接行動者之外、有許多陸海軍現役下級軍官、所以他們的工具有來源、同時他們的同道出有很安　藏匿的處所、血盟團的領袖、名呌井上昭、（又名日召）其團結的主旨是、</p>
<p>現下我國（日本）的狀態、無論思想上經濟上及其他諸機構都有很多的缺限、政黨財閥、以及其他特權階級相與結納、沒頭（滿足）其私慾、貪圖其私利、以致誤國家存立之大義、紊亂國政、是以須职圖其革正···］、</p>
<p>這樣的說法很是轟動一部分人、引起一部分青年的同情、在承平日久、生活困窘的日本社會、確實能夠激起一種反抗的行動、所以在去年上海戰爭正激烈、選舉運動剛要舉行的時候、前財政大臣井上準之助突然被剌、相距不過一月光景、三井的忠僕團琢磨男爵、也被暗殺、首相犬養毅、且被擊殺於其官邸、這都與血盟團有直接的關聯、并且他們要殺人還不止此數、現據日本官方所已發表的人物、丨血盟團所預備要剌殺的名單如下、</p>

<p>丨周君來信丨</p>
<p>我有一個困難的問題，請你給我一個明家的指示。我想你的事情很忙，我該簡單點說吧：我是一個高中將行卒業的學生。家庭雖清塞，但目前還已父兄們在生利、所以還可以過去。我的年齡已有二十歲了。父母總是呌我把婚姻的問題，早早解决。過去的時候，他們曾經爲我說了許多的地方，！丨有些有錢或有勢的人的女兒！！但我總覺這種賣買式的制度，是不願去幹的。因此父母就把這事呌我自己去辦了。但是這種黃金迷的世界，沒有［大拉］的窮酸，又那裏有資格去談戀愛呢？所以這件事情，一直擱到去年，都以［且慢］二字去回答他們。可是去年暑假的時候，一個從前曾經和我相愛過的女子，她又和我［冷灰復燃］了。她在過去的時候，人們都說她是一個浪漫，墮落，極壞的女子。朋友們都勸阻我不要和她再行親近。父母們都責備我，說我不該那樣自暴自棄。但我覺得她不是那樣的人。她過去的生活。誠然是很墮落、但不是她的錯，完全是因好的年齡太輕，受人家的欺騙。他們不該責備她。我們應該原諒她！丨不，我們應該對她表同情。現在她旣　然的覺悟，我們怎可不去帮助她呢？所以我就下了很大的决心，立刻接受她的愛情了。同時她也對我非常地感激，所以我們的愛情已經到了最高的熱度。不過我們的困難，也就隨此而來了。原來她的你母，並不贊同我們的戀愛、這是最近我從他們對付她的態度方面看出來的。因爲最近幾個月來，他們對她的監視，非常的嚴密、凡是我所給她的信件，都要經過他們嚴密的檢查，甚至於不　交到她的手裏。（這種事情，過去是沒有發生過的）。使得我們的感情，都非常地隔膜了。同時，聽說我的家庭方面，看到我們已有密切的意思，也想爲我玉成此美。曾經托人到他家裏去說過。雖然我的父親和她的父親，都是多年的朋友！可是不得　領而還。所以這事，也就一直地擱下來了。從這兩點看來。她的父母，不贊成我們的事，是顯然的。這樣我們應該怎麽辦呢？我們就自動嗎？但又沒有方法呌她離開家庭？一因爲她是被他們監視着的。呌我親友們再去說情嗎？過去的事實，已經告訴我們了。再去碰釘子，又有什麽意思？那麽，就去掉她嗎？這種違背良心的事，我是不會做的！但是到底怎樣辦呢？還有一層，就是</p>
<p>先生能有辦法使她脫離家庭的束縛？但是我們以後的事情，又該怎麽進行呢？關　問題？生活問題？丨丨因爲我的家庭，最近發生了兄嫂不睦的事情，不久一定　破裂了。破裂之後，不是連我自己個人的生活。都要發生問題了嗎？那裏還有能力維持她呢？關於這點，</p>
<p>先生或許要說：［如果到了眞無辦法的時候，你們者　做事體去！］是的！這出是一個很妙的門路呀。但是在這人浮於事的社會，找事又那裏可有這樣容易呢？况且我們都無專門的技能，我不過是個高中的學生，她不過是個　桑學校畢業的學生，！丨絲業已經破產的中國，早早沒有事體給她去做了。丨丨我們又無有勢的人，那裏可以找到我們的飯碗呢？自然如果脫下袍子，到地底下去做牛馬的生活，那裏會沒有工作呀？但是這種早被優游生活養壞了的我們的身體，那裏能够作得下呢？所以這些在我們沒有進行此事的先頭，的確都有考慮的必要，你說是嗎？素念</p>
<p>高明的先生！對於這些困難的問題，一定能夠給我一個完美的答覆的。我很急地盻望着！</p>
<p>覆：讀罷來信，我們很有一點感慨，這戌慨不是說什麽舊社會的壓迫等等，而是覺得我們中國青年是多麽欠缺自立能力。像足下，在沒有發生戀愛問題之前，靠着父母過［優遊生活］，還不感覺到什麽欠缺；待到現在，爲了戀愛，相獨立生活，就立刻感到了種種困難，這正是十足暴露了青年依賴性的弱點！這雖不是我們所要答復足下來問的要點，然却値得特别提出，和足下商量商量。然後我們再談戀愛問題：足下對於曾經失足的她，能夠原諒她的受人之欺，對於她的覺悟表同情，並能决定去接受她的愛，這破除一切的見解，是値得我們贊成的。可不知對方的覺醒，是否是眞的，而你的對於她的觀察，是否眞切，有無爲感情所蔽之處？這就還要足下去仔細考慮一下。假使你對於她的觀察，確是眞切的，則此項戀愛，完成極易。照來信所說，足下家長，對此項婚姻，已表同意，而對方家長，則又反對，這頗有些奇怪；對方旣曾經失足，照理該是你的家長出來反對此項婚姻，對方家長，大概會有什麽不願的，現在則反之，實在有點不合常理。不知對方家長所反對者何事？就是他反理這婚姻是什麽理由之這方面，足下宜回开究，研究結果，無論其有理無理，在這有理無理之中，你總可找出一個解决方法，這方法就是善意的解釋對方父母之誤會，假若對方家長竟固執到底，則你們兩人如自問有和社會鬥爭的勇氣，至少有獨立生活的能力、你們不妨脫離家庭，另組小家庭。依照法律，男女　届成年（足二十歲），就可自由與人訂婚結婚，無論何人，都不得加以干涉的，這一點，你不必怕人壓迫你。（惟應注意對方己否成年）脫離家庭後的生活問題，自然應該自己想法，假使怕臨時找不到職業，可在沒有實行同居之前，先行去找尋，待至找到一定職業，生活不發生問題，就不妨照你目的去做。你說身體已被一優遊生活一養壞了，那也不過是一種託詞。你身體縱然不十分强健，總還不至於做不得事，就是苦工不能做，普通不大勞力的事體總不至於磨折壞了你。假若你根本怕做事，只想依賴人家過活，那你根本不配做現代青年，根本不配談戀愛，還是去聽人擺布好吧！假若你有勇氣和社會鬥爭的話，則這種起碼的獨立生活，係是應該有方法使之實現的。社會上還有更大的困難待你去打開呢。你若處處畏縮怕事，以［嬌養慣了］這名話自辯，怕一輩了沒有然望。强健的體魄，勇敢的精神，正該在艱苦萬難中磨練出來的，你怕磨練，光明那得來？這里，足下應該有些深刻的認識！在此，記者以爲：目前重要問題，似尙不在［怎樣完成］這問題，而在［要不要完成］這問題，換句話說：就是你要戀愛成功很容易，而對方的是否眞可愛？她也是否眞在愛你？將來的結查是否能圓滿？這些問題，你却還要下一番研究的工夫。不要逞一時之感情，到將來　塲沒結果。道是記者願在來信所問之外，再爲足下進一言者，願三思之！</p>

<p>學校敎育及社會敎育的概况</p>
<p>現在要簡略報告各級　　的現狀如下：</p>
<p>一幼稚園學校敎育的第一階段、是幼稚園、對於兒童的培養爲重要、本市幼稚園獨立設置、極少、人多數　是附設於小學校、只有市　第一糼稚園、是一個獨立的糼稚園、一九二九年創辦的、市立小　附設幼稚園的共有十二校、此外私立立安的幼稚園、有五所、再加上私立未立案的有廿所、以及省立上海中學幼稚園、總計起來、本市共有二十九所幼稚園、照一九三一年度的統計、這些幼稚園兒童、合共有一八五六人、敎師共有一一○人、</p>
<p>本市幼稚園、大多設主任一人、率同敎員保姆若干人、分担一切敎學管理事務、如學生數在五十人以下的、就編爲一敎室、如學生有百名左右、那就分爲兩敎室、園内設備、有遊戲、音樂、工作·智識、裝飾各種　需之模型、以及表格、器具鋼琴·玩具等、他們的課程、大概分爲唱遊運動作業三大部分、根據兒童要求、用設計法、引起兒童動機、然後因勢利導、使得兒童身心都得到適當的發展、</p>
<p>小學校本市人口稠密、學齡兒童當然應該極多、諸位試想究有多少眞慚愧、據一九三一年度第二學期、（卽一九三二年夏）的統計、祇有六二四校、其分配如下、</p>
<p>㈠國立一、㈡部立二、㈢省立一、㈣市立一八六、㈤公共租界工部局立八、㈥法租界公董局立一、㈦他種公立三、㈧私立立案一四六、㈨私立未立案　七六、總計六二四、</p>
<p>以言經費、據一九三一丨丨一九三二年度統計、本市市立小學經費總數爲五二七、七九七元、而全市公私立小學經費之總數則爲二、二四八、一三六元、比一九二九丨一九三○年度二、一四五、二一一元、却已增加一○二、九二五元了、一九三一年冬季本市小學兒童總數爲㈠男丨丨八○、一一一人、㈢女十七三三、四九三人、共計一一三、六○四人、女　生幾達男學生的一半、可見女子敎育也已較前進步多了、講到年齡分佈的概况、大約初級生最大十九歲、最小四歲、而完全小學校的　生、最大二十歲、最小八歲、敎師的總數、據一九三一丨丨一九三二年席第一學期統計、共四、七八七人、大概每一敎師平均敎學生二十四人、這個比例、較之西洋各國、似乎太少、可見學校設備及敎師效率應該力求增進、希望能達到至少每學生五六十人、分配一個敎師、</p>
<p>至於學校的學級編制、大概市區小學入學兒童衆多、百分之八十以上、都是單式編制、也　有複式編制、鄉區小學、百分之八十以上係單級編制、有少數參用複式編制、而單式編制却百不得一、敎學方法、大都中高年級採用日學輔導、低年級採用設計、於班級敎學之中、順及個性差異、此外特設第　實騐小學、前年試騐導爾頓制、本年度試行生活本位整　敎育、</p>
<p>講到小學畢業生狀况、也　有興味、據一九三○丨一九三一年度統計、全市市立小學畢業生共一、二三一人、其中升學者占百分之六二、七一就業者占百分之二三、○八、賦閉者占百分一八、六一、其他占百分之五、六○、</p>
<p>此外、關於小學課程、都是照敎育部所規定的、至於設備、市區學校比較鄉區學校完全、市區小學差不多都有敎室、工作室、集會室、體育塲、學校園、合作社、書報室、消防衛生的設備、多數學校均已設置、鄉區小學及私立小學、設備較市區的市立學校稍差、</p>
<p>㈡中學校本市小學旣有六百以外、當然中學校的需　、也極其迫切、本市中學校雖然不能算是發達、但比較從前已是很進展了、現在把大概狀况、分述如左、</p>
<p>（甲）全市中學總數全市中學分兩種、㈠初級中學、國立一、市立二、私立立案一一、私立未立案二四、共計三八、㈡完全中學（兩級）國立一、省立一、市立二、工部局立五、公董局立一、私立立案三八、私立未立案二五、共計七四、</p>

<p>— 瘦鵑</p>
<p>無論那一國的文學家小說家，單單做一國聞名的文學家小說家不算希罕，必須做成一個世界聞名的文學家小說家，纔是難能可貴。俄羅斯的高爾基氏，ＭａｘｉｍＧｏｒｈｉ就是當代世界聞名的文學家小說家之一，俄羅斯人的敬愛他；崇拜他，尤過於執掌全國政權的史大林氏，他那一枝律，眞的是勝於十萬毛　了，高爾基實在是一個筆名，他的眞姓名呌做潘希考夫，Ｈ·Ａ·Ｍ·Ｐｙｅｓｈｄｏｆ知道的人却是很少，而高爾基三字，那是家喻户曉，無人不知的，他的故鄉是尼尼奴夫高洛ＮｉｊｎｉＮｏｖｇｏｒｏｄ地方。他的生日是一千八百六十八年三月十四日，到今年恰是六十五歲。他生平執業很多，時常變換，打破一切文學家與小說家的紀錄。據他自傳中的節目說：一千八百七十八年，做鞋匠的學徒。一午八百七十九年，做畫師的學徒。一千八百八十二年，在一艘汽船上做洗濯餐具的工作。一千八百八十三年，做麵包師。一千八百八十四年，給人家守門。一千八百八十五年，重又做麵包師去。一千八百八十六年，做樂隊裏唱歌的人。一千八百八十七年，做蘋果小販。一千八百八十八年，因活得不耐煩起來，投身在自殺會中，預備自殺。一千八百九十一年，做律師的書記。一千八百九十二年，無事可做，就做了個無業的游民，游遍俄羅斯全國。一千八百九十三年，在鐵路上當工人。看了他這種種經歷，正好似吾國唱蘇灘的口頭演唱出來的那個十棄行的馬浪蕩。然而他却因此見多識廣，終於做成了一位善寫平民疾苦的文學家小說家，他的文章，都是用他的筆尖兒蘸著他自己的血；汗；和眼淚寫出來的。一千八百九十四年，他開始刋行他的第一種短篇小說，以後就做了許多長篇；短篇；與劇本，行間字裏，充滿了悲天憫人之念，所以他至今還做著新俄羅斯文壇上的權威者。我譯過他兩個短篇小說，一：［綠貓］，二：［薄命女。］</p>

<p>— 郭蘭馨</p>
<p>嚴重的國難開展在眼前，但都市中的人們還是在醉生夢死般過着那胡帝胡天的生活，大家以爲東北邊塞的槍砲聲，終不及去年淞滬之役的緊張害怕，於是國難讓它國難，享樂我自享樂；現在我們來巡禮到舞塲中去。</p>
<p>在天滬跳舞廳裏，音樂鏗鏘，舞女如雲，燈紅酒綠，這樣陶醉的享樂的地方，發現不少熱心救國的志士，在白天曾經激昂慷慨的演說，只不過演說罷了。晚上就埋葬在白天所痛心唾駡的地方去，啊這是怎樣一個大的矛盾呢？</p>
<p>大辣斐花園，發見幾個擁護跳舞救國的同志，我不相信摟着軟玉温馨懷抱，按着綿綿之音的曲調，在光滑的地板上舞着，隔絶了外面饑寒窮苦充滿的世界可以寓娛樂於救國？</p>
<p>在月宫，在大東，在新新，那一處留着國難的影子，那一塊抱有救國的激憤，燕幕危巢，魚游釜底，這樣享樂下去，大好的中華民國會輕而易舉的滅亡。物必先腐而後蟲生之：人必自侮而後人侮之，國必自伐而後人伐之：願享樂的人們憑自己的良心，三復這幾句話纔好！</p>
<h3 id="c258">東南風 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 臥佛</p>
<p>西北風才是救國的，東南風就只有亡國！</p>
<p>我說這話：並不是發瘋，實在因爲我的感觸太深了，看了這一次河河流冰凍。　　前幾天，鎭天鎭夜價刮着如椎如剪的西北風，寒暑表天然降到了零度。雖則這由西北風送來的禮物，拿義軍們的在浴血的關外來比較，還是相去不可以道里計，可在温暖慣了的江南人，恰夠受用了。不過，我們在打着寒噤中會感覺到興趣，尤其是孩子們，因爲丈來開闊的溝渠的水，都凝凍了寸來的冰，瞧上去正像一面大鏡子。可惜這裏除了一般天眞爛漫的孩子們競在冰上賽跑外，恰沒有北平式的青年男女，要是不，那這一番溜冰的興高彩烈，定然造成新紀錄。　西北風是不住的刮，冰是不住的結，船舶都泊在灘旁，一天，二天，三天，老是動彈不得。朗照大地的太陽，雖則儘量發揮它的熱力，可何曾損及毫末！　　第四天的早上，風還是從西北刮來，水出自然又敎人刮目相看，一忽兒，太陽似乎因爲羞慚而退避了，可那冰的上層，恰泛出了一派油光色，又像美人一般含着兩眶清淚。到了下午，竟自悄沒聲兒的支解了。待到暮色蒼茫，欵乃之聲，一陣陣送入耳鼓，原來，這天十時起，西北風轉換了東南風，冷，依然如故，冰，却是無抵抗地都給東南風吹到了烏有之鄉。太陽在汗顏着下山的當兒，害然的發射出萬道金光，似乎故同大地誇示它的勝利，掠人之美，它倒一點也沒有愧色。</p>
<p>雫馬燈，獅子燈，飛機燈，拿在幾個摩登姑娘的手裏，更學得玲瓏而又美觀。　　一對一對的情侣，在黃昏時分的觀前大街踱着，擁擠着，手中提了葉受和的粮菓，采芝齋的瓜子····這是蘇州的好現象嗎？</p>
<p>［出關援助］［枕戈待命］［請纓殺敵］［負駑前驅］［武力抵抗］［收復失地］［····］［······］這就等於冰，西北風凝凍，東南風消滅。</p>
<p>［老北風］才是名副其實。善於　營的東南風，到此也將自嘆黔驢技窮，縱敎挿了雙翅，也不會給飛出關外一步，衝破西北風的壁壘，更休夢想！</p>
<p>西北風格是救國的，東南風就只有亡國！</p>

<p>一座宫殿式巍峨壯麗的玄妙觀，每日下午，人潮總擁進擁出的浮動，有仙鶴般的挺秀男子，有蛇一般妖媚的女人，更有小妹妹和小弟弟····擁擠罷！波動罷！熙熙攘攘，却實惠了點心店，雜貨攤，耍戲法，唱灘黃，磁舖，鳥店·····女人儘在皮篋中挖，男子儘在身畔摸，走出了廟門，乞丐釘在後面娘娘小姐少奶奶少爺的呼喚，但是捨不得摸出一個銅子！</p>

<p>又是一陣機關聲以後，子彈照例又是雨點似的洒在他們身上。跟着又是一陣呻吟，哀痛，哼聲，殷紅的鮮血流，流，流，不停的流着······</p>

<p>［啊····啊····啊····啊］</p>

<p>無錫的泥玩偶確實不錯，至少是細緻而句　，色調反差强烈，容易惹起孩子們的注意。所塑的孩子的臉蛋都可愛，都是江浙區域孩子的典型相貌：細眼，長眉，圓滿而突出的臉蛋，增咧着笑嘴，就可惜家家所做的個個孩子的臉相都是一模一樣。假如敎育的效果也成爲這個狀態的話，那末人類眞可以用機械來驅駛了。</p>
<p>以前經過無錫多次，每次都因爲許多烟囱而認識這是無錫，以爲到了無錫便不啻置身烟囱之林，不免有要繞着烟囱轉圈子之慮。等到眞個到了無錫。才放心了烟囱不如我預料的那麽多，雖然無論在何處都看得見。</p>
<p>惠泉的水高過杯品半分許而不溢瀉，據說這算是一種奇績。後來我們在萬前路的一家飯館試把它們的茶斟在杯子裏，也是高過杯口半分許而不溢。這家飯館所用的並非惠泉的水。然而你還可以這樣辯護說：這到底是無錫的水。回到上海，斟了一滿杯茶，一樣地可以高過杯口半分許而不溢。據他們說，惠水的水有較多量的鐵質，體積也比較别處的水來得重。我想水質與别處不同，也許是對的，但是與溢不溢恐怕不很有關係。</p>
<p>在惠泉附近有一口小小的方池，大約三四尺方的口徑，三四尺深的水，游人把銅板丢下去，因爲銅板不直沉到底，一定作曲折線狀下去，於是便承認這裏的水是神奇了。游客把銅板丢下去之後，當然不去撈起來，因爲顯示出吝嗇事情還小，對於這有神聖意味的泉水的不虔敬則事大。我記得杭州的龍井或是虎跑也有這麽一個也，韜光上頭有一個小池也有人像這樣地丢銅板進去，至於銅板何以不會多得堆積到滿起來，給誰人收拾了去，則是一件莫可究詰的事。今天在家裏寫到這一段，想着了，投下了筆，帶了兩個銅元，放了一滿鉛桶的自來水，等水波靜止之後，把兩銅元逐一丢下去，其曲折下沉的情狀，竟同那名山聖泉的情影無甚二致。　是名勝古蹟總要保持着一點神秘才夠味兒，我這樣倔强執着地將它們戳穿，眞是有點煞風影，罪過罪過！寫至此處，應念［南無阿彌陀佛］三百遍。</p>

<p>— 李英</p>
<p>[好？]我就回去，你讓我再散一點點好不好妻那樣温柔，那笑臉，那話題，使阿勞沒辦法了，再看了看快五個月的大肚子，走回河浜去，一面叮囑的說：</p>
<p>［不等我再挑泥回來，你可一定要先回去呀。］說着，走着，不住的回頭。</p>
<p>吃過晚飯，天已經黑了，阿勞聽了妻說肚子有點痛，楞了一下，忽然他眼前伏上一片黑，但，他一冷眼就過去，對着妻說：</p>
<p>［你上床躺罷，我去洗碗。］</p>
<p>於是妻上床，阿勞把妻應該做的事一一做過了。心是那樣的慌，自己不知道做些什麽東西。然後，點上燈，跑到妻的床邊。</p>
<p>妻的肚子，說是越來越痛，起先還能同他說些話，回答他問的話，後來竟在床上滾了起來，只是痛喲］［痛喲］的呌着。</p>
<p>阿勞眞是沒有辦法了。想說：［我要你早點回來，你不聽話，看哪····看弄到這個樣子·······］但他不能說，說，妻更難過了。並且也怨不得她，要怨她不如怨自己　，有錢僱人，不是什麽事都沒有了麽！</p>
<p>他怕那不幸事情發，他祈求着，請醫生，不但沒有錢，而且鄉間還請不到！</p>
<p>他祈求着，只有這麽辦了。</p>
<p>妻到後痛的翻，滾，哭，呌，怎樣做那不好過。他簡直要哭！妻一句怨他的話也不說，更使他難受，他想至少妻也該說：［你這個窮鬼！</p>
<p>過了好久時候，妻似　好了些，阿勞也稍爲安心了。他想那不幸事件大概不會發生罷。他祈求着，祈求上天保佑。</p>
<p>但上天是不管這些事的。過了一會，妻的肚子更厲害的痛起來。極榮慌張了。</p>
<p>一切事情不是上天或是上帝可以保佑到的，而是順應自然的條件的。就如：阿榮沒有錢，妻所以帶着大肚子到田裏做活，累着了，肚子裏的生物起了變化，那，到後來，經過幾番的劇痛，終於流產了，血水染滿了一床。看着那辨不清楚的肉團子，還沒有送了生命的阿榮的妻，對着在細收服侍自己的丈夫，終於傷心的說出了好幾句憤話：</p>
<p>［我們就不能有個孩子麽？窮啊，窮人眞不是人呀。可是，爲什麽我們會窮呢？我們不是一天到晚在做活麽？爲甚麽那些閑着不做一點事的人，可以有錢，生子又生孫；我們這樣拼命做活的人，倒窮得連孩子都不能生呢？你告訴我，窮人眞不是人麽？······］</p>
<p>阿榮只是靜聴着，緊緊的抓着妻的手，眼眶裏吊着兩行熱淚。過了一會，憤然的說：</p>
<p>［不管！窮人也是人，也要活，一定要生孩子。偏要多生呢！總有一天，我們會翻過身來的！］</p>
<p>妻點着微弱的頭，到後用乏力的手，緊緊的把阿勞抱住了，斷續的說：［成功·····要生·······孩子！窮人也·····是····一條！偏要生·····孩子···］兩痛創的心上，似乎都閃動着一絲微光。（完）</p>

<p>— 玄</p>
<p>英國文壇老將蕭伯訥近在環游世界的途由，不久就要到上海。</p>
<p>中國智識界大概還沒忘記這位蕭老先生在十年前的五四運動時代曾被熱烈地介紹過罷？一提起易卜生，大概會聯想到蕭伯訥罷？大概就會想到［華倫夫人之職業］一劑中所提出的問題丨丨資本主義文明下所包孕的矛盾，在五四當時曾經引起青年們如何熱烈的注意罷？</p>
<p>蕭老先生的全部著作是批判資本主義文明的。他的風格兼含幽默和冷諷。我們看了［武器與人］中間那個把朱古律糖在子彈盒裏的［少爺兵］的行涇，我們一定要笑的，可是我們在笑中一定也要感到一縷的酸冷罷？在這偉大的劇本裏，蕭老先生暴露了帝國主義代言人對於近代戰爭的一切阿諛粉飾！一切騙人的大謊丨丨什麽爲世界文明而戰，爲公理而戰，蕭老先生輕輕地笑着就一古腦兒戳穿！</p>
<p>他和新近去世的同在英國劇壇負盛名而且得了去年諾貝爾文學獎的高司華綏是不同的。高司華綏的作品雖然表面上似乎亦是抉發現代資本主義社會的矛看腐敗，可是根底裏他還肯定着現制度並且替現制度辯護的。</p>
<p>自歐戰以來，許多曾以人生戰士自居的歐洲老文豪都開了倒車了：不開倒車而更向光明猛進的，在法有羅曼羅蘭，在英有蕭伯訥。兩位都指斥帝國主義的暴行。在這太平洋上風雲險惡，帝國主義加緊準備瓜分中國和進攻蘇聯的世界大戰時；我們對於蕭伯訥來游中國表示歡迎，並且希望他以夠參加不久亦將到中國的世界反帝國主義大同盟所組織的調查團！</p>

<p>我認爲［偉人］不是英雄］，更不是權貴］或［豪富。］只有一個能爲［大衆］謀福利，爲［大衆］而犧牲，或其言行足以影響歷史甚至推進歷史的人，纔能被推爲［偉人］。依據此一原則，我所擬定的［現代世界十大偉人］，是下列十個：</p>
<p>㈠甘地太戈　會說：［甘地一生就是犧牲的别名］。這眞是甘地全部人格的寫照。他領導印度的一殖民地革命運動。］爲求被壓迫民族獨立解放而堅决奮鬥，雖說他的和平的［不合作主義］有可非議之處，但在他領導之下，印度的民族獨立運動之急劇展開，則爲很顯然的事實。</p>
<p>㈡史達林他是現在世界唯一的［社會主義國家］的領導者。在他的領導之下的五年計劃之成功。已使蘇聯的經濟基礎更臻於穏固，使資本主義列强都驚惶錯愕莫知所措。</p>
<p>㈢愛因斯坦這是一個偉大科學家，他所發明的［相對論，］修正了牛頓的［力學的法則］，成功了科學界一大革命。雖然他自己曾說目前世界上能完全了解他的學說的人不到一打之數，但無論如何，他的工作是爲了全人類的福利，則毫無可疑。　　㈣凱末爾他是新土爾其的建設者，土耳其人在他的領導之下，曾以三年持久的苦職，敗退希臘軍，挽回土爾其的末運。</p>
<p>㈤莫索里尼莫索里尼是什麽？是惡魔，也是怪傑，他所領導的［法西運動，］是阻滯時代車輪前進的一個障碍，然而他能使戰後紛亂疲弱的意大利躋於强國之林，究不失爲一個［偉人。］</p>
<p>㈥高爾基高爾基是蘇聯，不，全世被虐待大衆的代言人，他不但說出被虐待大衆的］切苦楚，他並且鼓勵，勸誘，指導［下層］的文學活動　　㈦居理夫人她是　的發現者，曾兩次得到諾貝爾物理學獎金。</p>
<p>㈧托落斯基他曾手創紅軍。在蘇聯革命初期，他曾指揮十二條戰綫，雖說他現在因變節而被逐放，但他底創造蘇聯的偉績，究不可沒。</p>
<p>㈨蕭伯訥他是一個最急進的帝國主義國有的一個反帝國主義的文人，他具有横溢的天才，和豐富的學識。他的作品饒有幽默的意味。</p>
<p>㈩胡佛他是快要卸任的美國大總統，前年他的連環停付戰債與賠欵一計劃，多少曾給予世界一個比較有力的反應。</p>

<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>［他倆疲倦了，熟睡下去了吧。眞該殺！！！只剩自己到這三更半夜，還睡不着！不錯，那個日本佬是在三樓曾教授書房裏睡的。今晚上並沒見他上去。眞是大胆！］</p>
<p>他偷聽了一下，仍然是不得要領，便又頽喪地回到三樓上來。他再走到曾先生的書房門首，輕推了一下門，像從裏面　住了，于是緊壓在他胸口的一塊石頭，輕鬆下來了。</p>
<p>［她一定來看了我的，因爲我睡着了，沒有驚動我，就走了吧。］</p>
<p>他這　地自寬自慰着睡進被窩裏來了，他感着他的腦神經又似　麻又似微微的在作痛。他</p>
<p>自己是十分願意　了，但無論如何總是睡不着。再看了一下手錶，三點半了。</p>
<p>他於第二天早晨醒來時，已經七點多鐘了。望了望窗口，不見陽光，只是滿窗的灰白色。他想，天氣又轉變低氣壓了，和昨晚上的鶴子夫人的臉色一樣。</p>
<p>近幾天來，他對於校課比初進校時放鬆，常常缺課。所以今早上起來，來得及上第一課與否，他是並不十分在意。他只是思念着鶴子夫人的事。</p>
<p>［自己在精神上已經做了她的俘虜！］</p>
<p>他剛從被窩裏翻身坐起來，正在揉眼眼。娘姨送了一封信上來給他，他接在手裏看了一下，封面上並沒有貼郵票。</p>
<p>［誰送來的？不是郵差？］</p>
<p>［不是郵差，一個後生他送來的，把信丢了下來，就走了。］</p>
<p>他覺得封面的筆跡是他常看見過的，不過一時想不起是誰寫來的。他忙拆開來看。</p>
<p>［海泉兄，陳君約你於今晚八時去會他。關於文藝討論會的事，有所磋商。希於七時半來弟處，一同前往。知弟字，七日早。］</p>
<p>雖然在信末沒有署名，但他知道了這封信是唐耀星寫來的。他看了信後，心裏又有些不快起來。第一，因爲革命文學家陳澤民先生總不肯把他的住址告訴他，第二，是唐耀星時常鬼鬼祟祟，總沒有痛快地把他們的底藴告知他。第三，在這封信後面，他竟不肯署眞姓名。這些疑問終於引起了海泉對他們的反感。他看了後，把那張信紙揑成一團，向字紙簍裏一摔。他的思索又轉向到鶴子夫人身上來了。同時，他感着一種不可言喻的懊惱。</p>
<p>他拿着牙刷和毛巾，懶懶地走到二樓來。剛進洗澡間，忽然看見鶴子夫人的房門打開來了他再禁遏不住了，放輕脚步，走前去，想睞一下裏面，看她到底在房裏做些什麽事體。</p>
<p>他不看猶可，一看見房裏面的情狀時，他的　妬之火便爆發了。</p>
<p>鶴子夫人還是頭髻蓬鬆的裹在被窩裏，只是伸出一隻雪白的臂膀在被窩外面。她的食指和中指之間夾着一根香烟，從她的嘴裏也噴出一陣陣的白烟來。那個日本佬還是穿着中國的長棉袍兒，手裏也拿着一枝香烟坐在她的足部那頭的床沿上，斜依着床欄，好像是在和鶴子夫人說笑，</p>

<h3 id="c268">怎樣避免結婚後的悲劇？（二） <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 顧鳳城</p>
<p>第三，各人思想與行動的不調和。在戀愛時期中，雙方往往以一時熱情的衝動，或專抱了［戀愛是沒有條件的］主張，少有注意到相互的思想與行動的。祗要看怕有的情書中，偏於思想的討論的是極少數，大多數的完全是情感的抒寫，有時各人或許也注意到思想方面。不過他們的討诠是很浮泛的，不切實，反不若與朋友的討論來得切實。而且在戀愛時他們的思想極容易趨向一致。比如說男的是基督敎徒，女的因爲愛他的關係，往往也變爲一個基督敎徒或準基督敎徒，或者男的木來是一個很積極的參加革命的一個青年，但女的不贊成他這種帶有危險性而又不安定的生活，那時男的往往會放棄了一切的工作而與女的過一種頽廢逸樂的生活。所以，在戀愛時假如他們的思想不一致，結婚後可發生二種可能的悲劇：第一種是結婚後發見出各人的思想與行動的絶對不調和或大大的不調和。二人因此而破裂或離散；第二種是結婚後男的敵應於女的，或女的適應於男的，結果二人同走到頽廢或縱慾的路上去。致於因爲思想與行動的分歧，而結婚後反能一同走到正確的人生積極道上去的，這種人雖然也有，但是是佔很少數的份也。</p>
<p>第四，結婚後性的機能的不調和，往往也是發生悲劇的一種重大原因。我們知道：性慾是人類本能的一種，性的生活，是佔據結婚生活中的重要部分。在戀愛時，對於性的方面往往最忽略。各人簡直完全不能知道對方的性的方面的情形。但是在結了婚後，往往他們一切的條件者適合了。而性的方面的不能調和，因而發生悲劇的是很多的。結婚是靈肉一致的結合。我們不是唯心論者，當然不能完全靠靈的結合而忽視了性的調和。性慾因爲是人的本能，所以往往各人的强弱的程度不同；女的不能恰恰適應於男的要求，男的也不能恰恰適應於女的需要，在這一點上，對於他們前途的幸福是有很大的關係的。還有關於生育方面，女的或許不願意爲了小孩子而犧牲自己底青春，犧牲自己的精神，而男的却很希望着有一個孩子出來，在這一點上，他們也是不能調和的。</p>
<p>結婚後所可能發生悲劇的原因當然還有，我這裏不過舉出幾種最普通最容易發生而可最被人忽視的幾點出來。</p>
<p>怎樣纔可避免結婚後的悲劇的發生呢？請大家來討論吧！（完）</p>

<p>打倒廉恥的口號揭　後，［廉］和［恥］本來不成問題，任何寡廉鮮恥的事。儘可大胆去幹，原沒有話說，話雖如此，但是［羞惡之心，人皆有之，］到了不好意思的時候。總覺有些難爲情故以後有沒有談的價値我不能講。現在總還可以一談。</p>
<p>昨見報載，土爾其女浴堂一幕趣劇，頗是令人發噱，今轉錄如下。</p>
<p>土爾其阿答納地方。當某女浴堂正當顧客盈門之際，有一女客，狂呼［速逃命，屋將坍］一時秩序大亂，女客不及穿衣，全部裸體，沿馬路狂奔，於是馬路上因爭看模特兒游行，秩序亦爲之大亂，事後調查，該浴室並未傾倒，係其女客之惡作劇云。</p>
<p>的確，這一幕模特兒游行的趣劇，必在煞是好看。許多赤身裸體女子，沿街奔跑，羞人答答，必定有一副不好意思的態度，假定我在土爾其說不定亦在駐足傍觀拍掌大笑大呼好看之列。</p>
<p>但是，不，倘然遇有慣於日光浴的朋友和主張露體游行白女同志倒也不在乎此一定面不改色决不改於愴惶失揩本來赤身赤慣裸體裸慣有什麽希罕尤其是中國的女同志還要不在乎在爲什麽呢？我有報紙爲證</p>
<p>去年報載，香港某西人，發起裸體大會。中西女士加入者，頗爲踴躍，惟西女名雖加入，尙少實行，而中國女子，加入頗多，且亦能親身試騐，故該會會務之發達，得力於華女者不少去。</p>
<p>若照此看來，中國女子畢竟開通一些不但能說而且能行我更有兩件事足爲證據，近來西婦，暑天時髦赤足，故晨光希微或夕陽在樹各公園中即見不少中國摩登赤足女子蹀躞其中此足見中國女子摹仿性之厲害此爲一事又各國男子多剪髮，而女子剪髮者甚屬寥寥，而中國女子自近年以來十之八九已將三千煩惱絲斬草除根不留餘地此又一事。</p>
<p>語曰，城中好高髻四方高一尺，揣摩風氣變本加厲眞是中國女子特有的長技若使中國女子碰着這樣一套把戲我想决不會面紅耳赤儘可大踏步走上馬路不必飛步狂奔而土女惡作劇之技倆恐亦不値方家一笑矣。</p>

<p>今試取凸透鏡，放在燭火及紙上之間，則生燭火之倒像，映於紙上，若以此鏡裝入圓筒之内，使其所生倒像，通入暗箱即成照相器具，以玻璃片置箱底，上塗以藥，此藥遇光變化，能使所映之像留於玻面，照物體而攝其影，但以綠化銀感光過速，不易保存久遠，故以碘化銀或溴化銀代之，塗於玻片，置暗箱之内，以受光線，其用碘化銀爲灦片，用溴化銀爲乾片。</p>
<p>製濕片法先於哥路弟恩（Ｃｏｌｌｏｄｉｏｎ）</p>
<p>中加碘化鉀或碘化錏少許，塗於玻片之面，使成薄膜一層（以棉花火藥溶解於火酒及以脫之合液中稠膩如膠謂之哥路弟恩塗於玻面則以脫及酒精化散而哥路弟恩成爲薄層，）次將玻片携至暗室，浸入硝酸銀溶液則銀及碘化合，爲碘化銀，沉澱於玻片之膜内，放暗箱中。以之照相，則因物體反射之光線。較他處爲强，其碘化銀即起分解，兼收養氣，變爲養化銀，取出浸於硫酸鐵，或焦性沒食子酸液中，則碘養化銀，遇之反元，即有銀之細點，作暗黑色，附著於物像之上，而其餘感化弱處，因其質仍爲碘化銀，而不還元，於是顯出物像，名曰現像。俟其像明暗適宜，以光洗凈，浸於　化鉀或次亞硫酸鈉液中，則碘化銀遇之深解，而其還元之銀不變化而殘留，能使其像更爲堅定，是曰定像。此像與實物明暗相反，但可爲正像之基底，而不能供用，俗稱底片。（或稱陰畫又稱片）</p>
<p>製乾片法則用直辣的尼（Ｚａｒａｔｉｔｅ）和以溴化銀溶液，塗於玻片之上，用片照相，其感光變化，較碘化銀爲速，故近人皆用此片，名曰快片，其現像及定像之法，則與濕片略同。</p>
<p>欲從底片得正像，則宜用蛋白紙覆印一次，此蛋白與綠化錏相和，塗於紙面，浸入硝酸銀液，使成綠化銀，置暗室中乾之，上覆底片，晒於日光中，則綠化銀還元。變爲綠養化銀，呈紫褐色，而生物體之正像。</p>
<p>陽畫是曰晒像，洗滌之，浸於鍍金液中，（以綠化金少許溶解於水稍加炭酸鈉使成　性，）則綠養化銀，能收�</p>
<p>綠化金中之綠氣，使金還元，而有金之細點，爲暗紫色，附着紙面，使物像鮮明。是曰鍍像。</p>

<p>㈢同樣同是槍在上海有許多吸大烟的人，他們都有一根槍（烟槍）因爲那槍是必須之物，沒了牠就不能吸烟了，再講講東北的義勇軍吧，他們因爲沒有得到政府的津貼，他們的抗日，是完全出於愛國的思想，所以他們的槍（殺敵的槍）也是有限的，但是沒有槍是不能抗日的，我想最好全上海吸大烟的人，都棄了烟槍不吸，而把買烟的錢都去買殺敵用的槍，豈不是好麽？但是我想事實是决不可能的，（酬移助東北義勇軍）</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我們因了智識之不足，及其他種種問題，覺得有互相團結互相研究之必要。因此集合了幾個同志，組織成一個［業餘學術研究社一，其間經過了先生的扶植和指導，使我們的社務得漸漸的發逹起來，我們眞是莫名的感激！現在有志研究學術的男女同志丨丨有自動報名加入的，也有自社員介紹的丨丨加入我們這團體的，至今已有四十八個人了。但我們爲了［組織之前要鄭重］起見，對於本社的正式成立，還須經過相當的籌備。</p>
<p>在以前的籌備期中，我們也曾開過好多次的籌備會議，每次會議也常能得到確個新的提案，使我們的組織益臻完善；雖然也不免有小小的波折發生，但我們並不因此而遲疑而灰心，始終抱着再接再厲的精神，努力奮鬥下去。</p>
<p>最近我們議决了兩個　　，分頭進行：㈠爲謀本社法律地位上的鞏固，推由社員朱寳琳君負責辦理登記手續；㈡因多數新社員之要求，先把本社的研究會提前成立，在上次（五日）的會議中，决定暫時設立農學，工學，商學，文學四組，並且因爲願研究商學的很多，因此成立商學組公推社員謝宗源君倪子　君分任正副組長，至下次本社會期丨丨本月十二日即星期日下午二時丨丨即須開始從事研究，非特希望本社社員届時出席，並且歡迎各界至本社丨丨新閘路大通路小菜塲東斯文里新閘小學丨丨旁</p>

<p>聽。</p>
<p>以上便是本社的第過及現在情形的簡略報告，我們想：先生旣［樂於贊助］也一定樂於知道的，以後能進行至如何程度我們再繼續報告給先生聽，制是時我們却渴望着先生的指導和糾正。</p>

<p>編者按：自從本欄提倡［組織團體］之後，接着就有好多團體組織起來：但其中進行最速，成效最好的，却要推［業餘學術研究社］了。據來信看來，加入的男女同志，已經有四十八位：但他們還不自滿足，想繼續努力，實願將成立會延緩下去。這一點，我們的意見，略有不同。中國人大都是沒有組織習貫的，說句不客氣的話，該社諸同志，當然不能例外。倘使一方儘量的把社員人數擴充，而另一方面，却不能切實把團體組織起來：那末日後人數愈多，意見龐雜，無法團結，是不能免了。况且這樣遷延下去，各社員入社時的一團高興，難保不因之而渙散。我們以爲在社員達到五十人以上時，應暫時停止在社員人數上的擴大，劃出一兩個月來，專門討論充實内部的問題，等到這五十餘人，大家有了組織的訓練和組織的習慣之後，再行公開徵求社員。到得此時，因爲有了這五十餘人，作爲中心人物的緣故，即使有若干沒有組織習慣的人加入，也就不妨了。我們的意見是這樣，不知該社各同志以爲對不對？</p>
<p>至於最近的兩個决議案：第一個［登記］問題，當然是要辦的，不過沒有多大討論的價値。第二估［研究會］問題，就重要極了，因爲這是該社精神所寄的地方呀！討論這個問題，應當從［分組適宜與否］及［方法有效與否］兩點上着想。對分組的意見。當然以能分門别類爲上：但是也要顧到人才問題，每一組當中，至少要有一二位稍有學識而熱心負責的做領導，方能引起大多社員的濃厚興趣：否則寗缺毌濫。至於研究的方法一層。我們希望該社將這次研究會的記錄，寄給我們：我們能不能發現些意見，供獻給你們參考。</p>
<p>在［研究會］的時候，能容許外人旁聽，這層是再好沒有了。非但可使你們［帮助他人］的精神，充分發揮；而且在停止徵求會員時期，借此可使外界發生信仰。到得公開徵求的時候，就可以儘量的發揚了。</p>

<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>他與牆門間裏的幾個裁縫司務最要好，因爲他們能說跳老蟲的故事給他聽，他常在家裏弄了錢來請他們喝酒，嬲着他們講故事，擾得他們不能作工，桑阿强說了他幾句，他便翻起眼睛來駡道：</p>
<p>［你這家裁縫舖子都是我們挑你開的，這是我家的地方，我是家裏裏大少爺，誰敢來干涉我？你再要像煞有介事，明天趕你搬塲！］</p>
<p>桑阿强聽他的說話眞是有氣，要與他認眞辯理吧，他是一個小孩子，與他講不出理來，只得對他乾笑道：</p>
<p>［好少爺，但願你一輩子做府上的大少爺！］</p>
<p>［怎麽啦？你氣不服我做大少爺嗎？］茂生强着脖子，雙手撑在腰裏，横行到桑老板身邊去尋釁，桑老板輕輕的將他一推，他便倒在地下大聲哭呌起來，老板娘阿麗聞聲出視，急心將他扶了起來，大駡了桑老板一頓，哄了他半天，他總是不肯罷休，後來他趕過去，在桑老板的背上拼命的捶了幾十下，他才破涕爲笑，從此以後，桑老板喚他［小爺］，再也不敢愆他。</p>
<p>若華回家以後，茂生的氣燄稍减，因爲這個娘沒有好面孔給他看，他家裏不願意待，整天躱在裁縫店裏胡鬧，裁縫司務見幼中出入甚勤，故意敎茂生進去偵察幼中的舉動，茂生掩到裏面去俞窺了出來，便告訴他們：有時候娘摟着王叔得面孔，有時候他們在一個盆裏洗澡，有時關緊了房門不看見什麽，裁縫司務聽了也以爲是新鮮話靶，時時的拍着茂生的馬屁，向他打聽新聞，像外勤記者釘着要人家新聞一樣。</p>
<p>有一天，茂生偷到内室去採訪新聞，順手牽羊在房裏帶了一塊幾角錢出來，不幸事機不密，被丫頭看見了，一把將他抓住，當塲搜出原贓，丫頭去報告了太太，將他提來審問了一遍，證據確實，再也抵賴不抻，幼中在傍邊看了，也主張非嚴加懲罰不可，於是茂生被按在春凳上，由若華親自動手，打了他十幾下屁股，打得他殺猪般呌起來。</p>
<p>茂生受了責打，便去哭訴阿麗，他把偷洋錢的事隠瞞起來，只說後母無端將他毒打，並要將他弄死，阿麗受過大太太托孤之責，有監護茂生之權，聽了茂生一面之詞，覺得若華虐待得他太出過份，她便帶了他同到裏面去見若華太太。</p>

<p>Japan's New Proposal is Considered Ambiguous</p>
<p>The So-Called "Existing Situation" Directly Contradicts the Lytton Principles</p>
<h3 id="e2">Letter Questions the Japanese Delegation on Two Issues: Sovereignty Over Manchuria and Cessation of Attacks on Rehe [Yes] or [No] Demanding Clear Answers <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Geneva - This morning, the Committee of Nineteen convened and deemed Japan's new proposal to be full of evasions and ambiguities. It was decided to send a letter to the Japanese delegation requesting clear answers to the following two questions: (1) Does Japan recognize China's sovereignty in Manchuria? (2) Can Japan cease military operations attacking Rehe? The former question must be answered in writing. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>Geneva - The nine-member drafting committee continued to discuss the draft proposal this afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the Committee of Nineteen held a meeting. Regarding Japan's new proposal, it was considered not very precise. After discussion, it was decided to present two questions to the Japanese delegation, requesting written answers. One is [Does Japan recognize China's sovereignty over Manchuria?]. The second, presented orally, is [To show a spirit of compromise, is Japan prepared to cease military operations attacking Rehe?] It is generally assumed that the Japanese delegation will need to seek the opinion of the Japanese government on these two questions. The Committee of Nineteen has decided to extend the meeting until 5:00 PM. (Havas News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This morning, the Committee of Nineteen considered the Japanese proposal for two hours. The Committee considered this a possible basis for understanding, but felt there were ambiguities, fearing that the value of Principle 7 of the Lytton Report, namely regarding Chinese sovereignty, would be obscured by it. Therefore, it was decided to send a letter to Japanese representative Matsuoka, asking whether they did not consider the Manchurian situation, which they had already recognized as an independent state, as a solution. They requested a clear [Yes] or [No] answer. If the Japanese representative answers [Yes], the Committee of Nineteen is prepared to accept Japan's reservations and proceed with mediation in accordance with Section 3 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. If the Japanese representative answers [No], the Committee will proceed with Section 4. At the same time, the Committee instructed Secretary-General Drummond to discuss the situation in the Rehe province area orally with the Japanese representative and to state the serious consequences of invading Rehe and expanding the situation. They were told that if such an action were taken, mediation would naturally be impossible. Several members wanted this to be included in the letter to Matsuoka, but it was finally decided that an oral statement would be sufficient. The Committee considered the Japanese proposal a major step forward. However, the proposal repeatedly mentioned "the existing situation" in two places, so the Committee was unable to view this as a satisfactory basis for a solution. This point can be regarded as contradicting the principle of not recognizing "Manchukuo." The Committee decided to clearly stipulate that Principle 7 of the Lytton Report must have full guarantees. The sentiment in the meeting was that there must be no further delays, so the nine-member drafting committee was instructed to continue drafting the proposal. This afternoon, after the main leaders of the Disarmament Conference met, a small group may have to meet if there is time.</p>
<p>(Geneva) After the Committee of Nineteen met this morning, Spanish representative Madariaga, according to his statement, believed that the decision of the Committee of Nineteen to reject Japan's recent proposal was not far off. The Committee now appeared disappointed in its efforts to get Japan to accept a compromise. Its recent letter to the Japanese representative reiterated Principle 7 of the ten recommendations in Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report, asking Japan whether it could accept it, which was tantamount to asking Japan whether it could recognize China's nominal sovereignty in Manchuria. The Committee of Nineteen met at 11:07 AM this morning in the Secretariat. It was heard that the situation created by the Japanese's preparation for military action to invade Rehe was discussed seriously for the first time. However, this is the latest development in the Sino-Japanese dispute, and its consideration cannot be completed in a short time. However, in the initial discussion, the members frankly expressed their extreme concern about the future development of the situation in Rehe. As for whether Japan's recent proposal could be accepted as a basis for mediation, they did not want to make a decision lightly until they received a response from Tokyo to the written and oral inquiries from the Committee. However, according to Madariaga, the Committee will decide not to delay any longer once it receives Japan's response. The meeting adjourned at 1:00 PM this afternoon. Speakers included Secretary-General Drummond, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, British Under-Secretary of State Eden, German representative von Keller, Swiss representative Motta, and Turkish representative Hüsrev. (National News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<p>Public Bulletin: The Committee of Nineteen issued the following bulletin after its meeting this morning. This morning, the Committee of Nineteen considered the new proposal submitted by the Japanese delegation, which was submitted in response to the draft proposal and the Chairman's declaration submitted by the Committee to both parties on December 15 as a possible basis for mediation. The precise scope of this new proposal raised some questions. In order to eliminate any misunderstandings, the Committee decided to send a letter to the Japanese delegation requesting a clearer response to explain its position on Principle 7 of Chapter 9 of the Lytton Report. The text of the said Principle 7 is as follows: [The government of Manchuria should be modified so that it obtains a high degree of autonomy sufficient to adapt to the local conditions and characteristics of the three provinces within the scope of Chinese sovereignty and administrative integrity. The organization and management of the new civil administration must satisfy the requirements of good government.] At the same time, the Committee requested the Secretary-General to orally urge the Japanese delegation to pay attention to the news of Japan's continued electrical preparations and actions. The Committee believed that such actions could make the situation more serious and, even if not destructive, would endanger mediation efforts. The drafting committee will meet this afternoon after the leaders of the Disarmament Conference meet to continue discussing the report to be submitted to the Committee of Nineteen.

<p>Geneva - There has been no change in the situation since yesterday. This morning at 11:00 AM, the Committee of Nineteen met to discuss the new proposal submitted by Japan aimed at mediating the Sino-Japanese dispute. This proposal has gradually become a cliché. One of its contents is [Seeking a solution that is suitable to the current situation]. When a representative of a certain small country who loves to speak entered the meeting this morning, he asked, [How can peace be made to suit the current situation?] This shows the doubts of the representatives regarding accepting Japan's proposal. Representatives who looked profound did not want to criticize the proposal, but said that the Committee would give it extremely careful consideration. (Reuters dispatch from the 9th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic circles, although the Committee of Nine met on the 8th, it did not begin drafting the recommendations in the report, apparently waiting for the results of Drummond's final mediation with Japan. It is heard that the Japanese side intends to accept the draft solution, but this kind of mediation is only conducted unilaterally with the Japanese side, and it gives Japan a chance to make reservations regarding non-recognition of the puppet organization. We resolutely oppose it. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>

<p>Geneva - If the League of Nations abandons its efforts at reconciliation under Section 3 and moves to Section 4, forcing Japan to break with the League of Nations, Japan will issue a statement clearly declaring Japan's beliefs. Therefore, Representative Matsuoka, if the Committee of Nineteen decides on the 9th not to recognize Japan's final concessions, will issue a statement to foreign reporters by the representatives of the delegation immediately or tomorrow, explaining Japan's position.

<h3 id="e6">Committee of Nine Decides on Outline of Draft Recommendation <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) When the nine-member small group met on the morning of the 8th, it discussed the first four items of the recommendation case by case, and then began discussing the fifth item, because the fifth item was the most important in several respects. According to reliable sources, the main points of the first four items are as follows:</p>
<p>The first item mentions the general principles involved in this case, such as those stipulated by the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Nine-Power Treaty.</p>
<p>The second item mentions the general attitude of the League of Nations towards the Sino-Japanese dispute, especially focusing on the League of Nations Covenant. This section clearly explains the obligations of the treaty and the need to respect territorial integrity and independence.</p>
<p>The third item also mentions general principles, determining that the current problem cannot be resolved by force and must be handled in accordance with the general principles contained in the League of Nations Covenant.</p>
<p>The fourth item mentions the procedures to be taken to resolve this case, and determines that it is neither possible to recognize the existing political system in Manchuria, nor possible to restore the situation before 1931. The fifth item mentions the negotiating mechanism between the League of Nations member states, non-member states, and the two organizations in dispute in the development after the failure of mediation. Although the discussion of the fifth item has not yet been completed, the attendees all believed that it was appropriate to organize such a mechanism to monitor the implementation of the recommendations. The above five items account for half of the recommendation case. The rest can be prepared with about two more meetings. However, when the Committee of Nineteen meets tomorrow to discuss Japan's new proposal, the entire situation may change. After Japan made its recent proposal, the general atmosphere was better than before, but Japan's proposal may not be fully acceptable, and China's opposition to any concessions by the League of Nations must not be ignored. (Reuters dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The nine-nation drafting committee yesterday decided on the outline of the third part of the recommendation, consisting of eleven articles. The content is as follows: (1) Since the Manchurian Incident, the League of Nations has acted as a mediator, spending a total of sixteen months, but military actions have actually increased. Manchuria is Chinese territory, which is clearly recognized by the Nine-Power Treaty and other treaties, and Japan had no objection to this at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese dispute. (2) There were previously waves of autonomous movements in Manchuria. For example, on September 20, 1914, Zhang Zuolin declared his intention to protect the territory and its people and appointed himself commander-in-chief. However, this was a temporary act for local interests and was not officially announced as a separation from mainland China. By 1928, Zhang Xueliang was actually cooperating with the central government. (3) After the September 18th Incident, Manchuria and mainland China were completely integrated, with no distinction between inside and outside the passes. During this period, Japan used various tactics to prevent the unity and cooperation of the Chinese people. (4) Before September 18th, there were many outstanding disputes between China and Japan. For the benefit of their respective countries, they engaged in many diplomatic negotiations, but they did not achieve results. Japan then decided to use force to get what it wanted. (5) China still needs the assistance of various countries in its national reconstruction. At the Washington Conference, all countries recognized this in advance. (6) Before the September 18th Incident, there were various disputes, and China had also implemented boycotts of Japanese goods. Therefore, the boycott of Japanese goods after September 18th should be regarded as a retaliatory measure against the use of force, and can also be regarded as the ultimate implementation of the non-resistance doctrine. (7) The various principles cited in the Lytton Report are considered to be in the spirit of mediation and are fully based on the records of Articles 11 and 12 of the League of Nations Charter. (8) On the night of September 18th, Japanese officers may have claimed that their military actions were out of self-defense, but the military actions expanded from Shenyang to Changchun, and then to Jilin and Heilongjiang. The expansion of the military actions was increasing. The actions of the Japanese army after September 18th cannot be regarded as self-defense actions. (9) After September 18th, the Japanese military controlled everything. From military affairs, they advanced to seizing political and financial power. The independent state of Manchuria was entirely created by the Japanese General Staff Headquarters. Without Japan's military protection, independence would be impossible. Chinese celebrities are merely tools used by the Japanese. The Chinese do not submit to the independent state. (10) After the establishment of "Manchukuo," all political power is in the hands of the Japanese. (11) Before September 18th, China and Japan should each bear their responsibilities for the Sino-Japanese disputes. After September 18th, because China has always adopted a policy of non-resistance, China has been relieved of its responsibility. (China United News Agency dispatch from the 9th)</p>

<p>Representing the Opinions of Twenty Million Koreans</p>

<p>(Geneva) A leader of the Korean independence movement submitted a declaration to the League of Nations today, requesting the facilitation of Korean independence in order to build a foundation for the successful future of permanent peace in the Far East. (Central News Agency dispatch from the 8th)</p>
<p>Geneva - League of Nations Secretary-General Drummond received a request from Dr. Li Xinmin (transliteration), the Provisional Grand President of the Republic of Korea, representing the opinions of 23 million people in Korea, Manchuria, Japan, Siberia, Hawaii, Mexico, and the United States. He requested that the League of Nations Secretariat distribute it to various member states, requesting the League of Nations to pay attention, saying that the Korean issue is closely related to the current Sino-Japanese dispute. If the Korean issue is not properly resolved, the Manchurian issue will be difficult to resolve. The request cited the facts listed in the Lytton Report to show the relationship between the majority of Koreans residing in Manchuria. The request pointed out Korea's geographical relationship with China, Russia, and Japan, and said that Japan's annexation of Korea in 1910 violated treaties. Japan's annexation of Korea was the first step in the invasion of Manchuria, and the invasion of Manchuria was part of Japan's policy of conquering Asia by force. It also said that the tide of Korean nationalism has risen and is irresistible, and cannot be ignored any longer. (Havas dispatch from the 9th)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Japanese Army Ministry Issues Statement on Invasion of Rehe <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>Can Be Described as Utterly Absurd</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Army Ministry issued a statement today on the invasion of Rehe, the content of which is extremely absurd. It said that the Japanese army's attack on Rehe was to maintain internal security in Manchukuo. Since September 18th, the security of the three eastern provinces has gradually recovered, but Rehe has not yet been stabilized, and Chinese troops have infiltrated the territory to disrupt security and loot food everywhere, causing unrest throughout the province. In order to maintain its sovereignty and prestige, Manchukuo has decided to eliminate the Chinese troops in the Rehe territory. The Japanese military, in accordance with the Japan-Manchukuo agreement, has a joint mission. The Manchukuo army is suppressing the rebels, and this kind of action has precedents from Britain and France and is definitely not a war of invasion of China by the Japanese army.

<p>(Nanjing) Zheng Pu and others from Hubei in Beijing stated that the embankment works relate to the lives of the people in 36 counties in central Hubei. Yesterday, they telegraphed the General Headquarters for Bandit Suppression in the three provinces of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui, stating, "Your department's order on the 31st directs the Hubei Provincial Government that all matters concerning water conservancy and embankment defense should be directly handled by the Jianghan Engineering Bureau through the National Economic Council, in order to clarify the system and avoid disputes. The water conservancy and embankment defense are entirely local affairs. If they are placed under the direct jurisdiction of the National Economic Council, it will hinder the legal system and will not benefit the facts. The representatives of the fellow villagers associations in Hubei Province have telegraphed and requested the Third Plenary Session to propose the revocation and submit the order to the Hubei Provincial Party Department for reconsideration. Now reading the previous order, we are shocked. The powers of the Provincial Government are endowed by the Outline of National Reconstruction and should not be arbitrarily reduced. The shortcomings of the Hubei Embankment Engineering Bureau in the past cannot be denied. However, there are many ways to remedy this according to the law. Changing jurisdiction will only deepen the shortcomings. The matter concerns the lives of the people in 36 counties, and our colleagues cannot remain silent. Therefore, we appeal to have the Hubei water conservancy and embankment works be properly handled by the Hubei Provincial Government. The people of Hubei will be fortunate."

<p>丨What Will Be the Result?丨</p>
<p>(I) The End of the Road for [Reasoning]</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our country has been enduring and yielding, attempting to accommodate the so-called peace and justice. The price our people have paid for peace cannot be considered small, and the sacrifices made for justice cannot be considered few. As for the three northeastern provinces, extending to Yuguan, the land area is at least 3.78 million square kilometers. The population is over 30 million. The loss of life due to the Japanese military's atrocities is no less than 300,000. Property losses (since our government lacks statistics in this regard) are estimated to exceed 100 million yuan. Based on this, it cannot be said that our country's sincerity for peace and justice is not sufficient. However, how have we been rewarded? We still remember last December, when the League of Nations General Assembly, the proposals of the four countries of Czechoslovakia, Sweden, Ireland, and Spain showed definite recognition of fairness and justice, which was a voice of hope in these times dominated by iron fists. The most important point of the draft proposal submitted by the Committee of Nineteen to the Extraordinary Assembly on the 6th is that both factually and legally, it opposes the recognition of [Manchukuo]. However, at the same time, in order to accommodate Japan, it considers it impossible to restore the situation before the September 18th Incident. This kind of proposal seems beneficial to us on the surface. [Justice and peace] seem to have won a paper victory. However, we cannot be satisfied with this, and we deeply regret that the League of Nations has over-accommodated Japan's so-called facts. What is even worse is that on the 6th, discussions had reached a stage where points of agreement were emerging, but on the 8th, drafting was not even started, and the atmosphere at the meeting was extremely depressed, awaiting the development of Japan's new proposal. Currently, the three northeastern provinces are being ravaged, blood is being shed at Shanhaiguan, and Rehe is about to suffer the ravages of war. Regardless of all this, the main content of the so-called new proposal can be summarized as follows:</p>
<p>First, to seek mediation based on the spirit of the Lytton Report.</p>
<p>Second, the basis of mediation must first acknowledge [Manchukuo (puppet state)]. [Japan is even touting the absurd theory of Sino-Japanese-Manchu cooperation].</p>
<p>Third, mediation procedures must be based on the Drummond-Sugimura case.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Japan will appeal to the [world public] to seek a [public trial], etc. Alas, is Japan's so-called [public] the aristocracy in the eyes of Japanese militarists, or the blind masses completely anesthetized by Japanese militarism? If not, then there is probably no one else in the world who sincerely approves of the imperialistic monopoly and aggression and aids in cruel killings. However, the League of Nations Covenant clearly states that [war] cannot be used to affect international peace, and the [Kellogg-Briand Pact] also states that any international dispute cannot be [resolved] by means of [war]. However, Japan's invasion of the Northeast, the disturbance of Shanghai, the forcible seizure of Yuguan, and the bombing of Rehe are all [wars]. Each and every one demonstrates the violence of its army and navy. The League of Nations is deaf to this. What is the reason for not seeing with its eyes? It is merely because the two major powers of Britain and France are too concerned about friendly relations with Japan and value their immediate gains, and have forgotten the fact that our country is being invaded.</p>
<p>(II) What Good Is Speaking of Justice When Great Armies Are Pressing the Border?</p>
<p>We deeply respect the Allied nations in the League of Nations that advocate restraining violence with justice, such as the Czech Republic, Sweden, and Ireland. However, they are all small and weak, and the road is long and out of reach. Even if the League of Nations General Assembly accepts their proposals, it may not be able to stop the armed aggression of Japanese militarists. Moreover, the League of Nations was originally a tool used by the two major powers of Britain and France, and it has little to do with justice, fairness, and peace. Therefore, from the beginning, the peaceful resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute has been a kind of [perfunctory peace]. In a word, it is [no determination to restrain Japan]. Although the League of Nations has indeed made every effort to accommodate and do its best as a mediator, how has Japan repaid the League of Nations? On the one hand, it says that the League of Nations is a European League of Nations. From the military department, which holds real political power, to the financial and capital cliques, and even the scholars employed by the government, all have the same opinion. It vigorously advocates its Pan-Asian Monroe Doctrine. Furthermore, it says that Manchuria has a special relationship with Japan, which the League of Nations has never understood. As a result, the Shenyang Incident has spread to northern Manchuria, and recently the disaster has affected Rehe, involving Tianjin and Peiping. If this continues, Japan will definitely not stop until it has completely annexed China. Therefore, we say that the major powers of the League of Nations, due to their own interests, have no determination to restrain Japan's atrocities, and the Japanese militarists are well aware of the world's trends. They are unwilling to swallow China whole, but instead adopt a gradual policy of encroachment, with the aim of deceiving the world and playing with the League of Nations. Japan's true intention is not necessarily to have the League of Nations recognize the [Manchukuo (puppet state)] that it created. What it desires is to delay the matter in fact, so as to facilitate the expansion of its invasion network. The member states of the League of Nations should not be deluded by the [open door, equal opportunity] that the Japanese militarists advocate in words. They must be prepared for the fact that in a few years, the three northeastern provinces will truly be annexed by Japan, and the balance of power in the Far East will be completely broken by Japan.</p>
<p>Our country is currently facing [countless difficulties], and past failures cannot be denied. Even if we want to give up everything to seek an intangible peace, we cannot. Japan has amassed great armies, such as the Eighth Division, Tenth Division, Fourteenth Division, Twentieth Division, Nineteenth Division, First Cavalry Brigade, and other special units. Even [first-year soldiers] have been conscripted to the Rehe border. It is estimated that the number of people is no less than 100,000. Their desire to take advantage of the opportunity is obvious. This kind of barbaric action cannot be deterred by a resolution from the League of Nations by Lake Geneva. What do we get from [self-consolation with empty words]? Today, disaster is imminent, and it is impossible to live in peace and tranquility. How can we allow ourselves to live in humiliation? For the sake of our nation's survival, we must risk everything and fight to the death as a last resort.</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Zhou Junyan, Director of the Zhejiang Finance Department, stated that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek instructed Zhejiang Province to implement inheritance tax. This tax is still a pioneering effort in our country. The various committees of the Provincial Government are currently studying in detail the inheritance tax regulations established by the Central Government in the 17th year of the Republic. The tax amounts are divided into four classes. After drafting the methods and submitting them to the Executive Yuan for approval, the investigation and registration will begin. However, the investigation of movable property and cash is difficult, and whether it can be realized is unpredictable. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e75">New World Flight Record <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The British King and Prime Minister Send Telegrams to Congratulate the British Aviator on Success</p>
<p>French and American Aviators Will Hasten to Catch Up</p>
<p>(Marseilles, 9th) French renowned aviators Bossoutrot and Rossi are striving to grasp the world record for the longest distance around-the-world flight. The two once flew 6,587 miles. Now, British Air Force officers Gayford and Nicholetts have broken this record by flying a straight-line distance of 5,340 miles in 57 hours and 25 minutes. Today, it is heard that the aforementioned two French aviators plan to immediately start a straight-line flight to compete with Gayford and others.</p>
<p>According to news from Cape Town, Gayford and others' aircraft landed at Walvis Bay in southwest Africa last night, which is 5,340 miles from the starting point, Cranwell Aerodrome, and only 850 miles from Cape Town. Originally, they intended to reach their destination in one go, but due to poor atmospheric conditions, they had to land during the day out of caution. After landing, the two aviators immediately went to a hotel to get a full night's sleep. The two are energetic and well-groomed, not at all like people who have been in the air for 57 hours.</p>
<p>According to Gayford's report to the Air Ministry, the weather was clear along the way. It was not until they reached Nigeria that they encountered heavy fog, which hindered the flight. Mount Cameroon, at 13,000 feet, was completely obscured by clouds. During a heavy rainstorm on the second night, the sky was cloudy, and the automatic controller lost its effectiveness due to the adverse weather conditions, so it was not used afterward.</p>
<p>The journey was approximately nearly 6,000 miles, with an originally planned average speed of 93.3 miles per hour, but due to the obstacles encountered in Nigeria, the speed had to exceed 100 miles per hour.</p>
<p>The British King, Prime Minister MacDonald, Air Minister Londonderry, and the Air Defence Committee have all sent telegrams of congratulations. Pole Llewellyn B. Bubb, who with Boardman established a new record of 5,012 miles for long-distance flight from New York to Constantinople in 1931 (Boardman is American), also sent a congratulatory telegram, stating that he and his colleague Boardman will attempt to recover the lost record soon. This is because Boardman's record has also been broken by Gayford and Nicholetts' new record of 5,340 miles. (Reuters)</p>

<p>Representative Yan Withdraws from the Venue to Maintain National Dignity, Paul-Boncour Speaks on the Relationship Between Security and Disarmament</p>
<p>Geneva, Central News Agency, 8th The Disarmament Conference opened this afternoon. Due to a speech by French representative Paul-Boncour, the scheduled speech by Chinese representative Dr. Yan Huiqing was cancelled. Representative Yan immediately left the venue, believing that this action by the conference damaged China's national dignity. Because France's military strength is the strongest in the world, if the Disarmament Conference respects countries with stronger military power, there is little hope for its future success.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Paul-Boncour Defends the French Plan <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>Geneva, Havas, 8th At the General Committee meeting of the Disarmament Conference this afternoon, French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour delivered a speech to respond to criticisms from various parties regarding France's disarmament and security construction plan. Paul-Boncour believed that the French proposal should follow the organizational methods of the General Committee and be supplemented and studied by a special organization composed of representatives from all countries. Paul-Boncour stated that the French proposal was not a temporary decision, nor did it show favoritism towards certain friendly nations. It was based on the principles already achieved by the conference and integrated into one. Paul-Boncour repeatedly</p>

<p>are interconnected and inseparable, stating that this idea is based on Article 8 of the League of Nations Covenant. This article stipulates that disarmament should be proportional to national security and the obligations to be fulfilled internationally, and the special circumstances of each country must also be taken into account. According to this meaning, disarmament should adopt</p>

<p>rather than forcibly setting quotas. However, if coordinated with the preamble to Part V of the Treaty of Versailles and Article 8 of the Covenant, the promise of universal disarmament is included, and the relationship between disarmament and security is established on this foundation. Paul-Boncour reviewed the</p>

<p>stating that it had been decided that countries should assist each other to organize peace, leading to the appearance of the Geneva Protocol, but the signatory countries failed to unanimously approve it.

<p>London, Reuters, 8th The Air Ministry issued a statement today announcing the success of the long-distance flight. The statement praised the pilots and aircraft manufacturers, as the success of the flight was also due to the manufacturers. It also stated that Britain now holds three major world aviation records: speed, distance, and altitude.</p>
<p>Speed: In September 1931, Air Lieutenant Stainforth flew at 357 miles per hour in Garsh, later increased to 407 miles per hour.</p>
<p>Altitude: In September 1932, Captain Uwins in Bristol ascended to 43,996 feet (over 8 miles).</p>
<p>Long Distance: The new record created by Captain Gayford and Air Lieutenant Nicholetts this time.</p>
<p>The statement also stated that creating new records is of great value, as it proves the quality of British aviation materials and determines which aircraft are most suitable for remote parts of the Empire.</p>
<p>regional treaties, or establish treaties covering entire continents. The French plan suggests this type of treaty. At the beginning of the Disarmament Conference, the only guarantee of peace for all countries existed in the provisions of Article 8 of the Covenant, which</p>
<h3 id="e82">Only Limited Armaments <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>The French plan seeks</p>
<h3 id="e83">Other Guarantees <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>besides Article 8. Only with new guarantees can disarmament be effectively achieved. It is difficult to reduce military strength without first seeking a balance of power between countries or without first seeking uniformity in the military strength of countries. The Navy has already reached a compromise, so why can't other armaments be handled in the same way? Paul-Boncour also stated that the proposal to transfer offensive armaments to international ownership, if fair, would be unfair to countries threatened by aggression if they were not allowed to have the necessary defensive armaments. The French plan advocates a conscription system with a short term and slow mobilization, so that the League of Nations can act in time in the event of a conflict. Regarding the conscription of troops, if we decide to adopt a militia system, then countries cannot simultaneously adopt a professional army system outside of the militia system. However, this reform must first have a climate of security before it can be realized. Paul-Boncour reiterated the plan's advocacy of</p>
<h3 id="e84">Partial Treaties <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>are based on the proposals of the various committees of the League of Nations and past conferences. France believes that European countries should establish partial treaties to provide new guarantees for the security of all countries. Otherwise, demanding large-scale disarmament is impossible. After European countries establish partial treaties, they can seek supplements from countries outside of Europe. Countries that are not members of the Disarmament Conference are already bound by the Kellogg-Briand Pact and can gradually negotiate this treaty with them.</p>
<h3 id="e85">The Kellogg-Briand Pact <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>is theoretically insufficient, but its spiritual effect is great. Paul-Boncour stated that the evolution of the American mentality has become favorable. The French plan also takes into account the</p>
<h3 id="e86">Consultation Treaty <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>and the Soviet Union has also agreed to it. This is known to the world. Paul-Boncour also stated that the</p>
<h3 id="e87">Mutual Assistance Treaty <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>has encountered difficulties after being signed by a majority decision. The definition of "aggressor" is also sufficient to cause difficulties and is by no means insurmountable. For example, Soviet representative Litvinov's definition of "aggressor" is similar to the definition advocated by France. Paul-Boncour concluded that the level of disarmament must be based on the level of security.</p>

<p>London, Reuters, 8th The British debt to the United States currently totals approximately US$4,500,000,000. Today, a member of the British House of Commons proposed paying the United States a batch of ready money amounting to £100,000,000, approximately US$339,000,000, as a final and complete settlement.</p>
<p>New York, Reuters, 8th American figures are paying close attention to the news that Britain plans to pay the United States US$1,250,000,000 to US$2,000,000,000 in ready money to clear its debt to the United States. Senator Borah stated today that he would fully oppose any cash settlement method that does not include commercial concessions. Any plan must contain a scheme to address currency issues and other events that hinder the opening of the world market and the recovery of industry and commerce, otherwise he would not be willing to hear it. However, the New York World-Telegram stated that even if the ready money that Britain can pay is US$1,000,000,000, it can make up for the insufficiency of the American budget. Although this amount is small, it can eliminate resentment, which is more cost-effective than paper debts, which are ten times this amount, are gradually becoming worthless.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 9th According to information obtained by Reuters reporters today, the British government plans to send Prime Minister MacDonald, Trade Minister Runciman, and Finance Minister Chamberlain to Washington to conduct debt negotiations.</p>
<h3 id="e90">American Proposition <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Washington, National News Agency, 8th Although factions within the U.S. Congress who firmly oppose revising or canceling war debts are still active at this time, many more members are seriously considering two major points of organizing war debts. It is reported that a portion of senators believe a clear distinction should be made within the war debts between funds used for wartime destructive actions and funds used for post-war relief, reconstruction, and the purchase of necessities. These groups also believe that prior to resolving the war debts, the currency prices of major debtor nations must first be stabilized and methods must be adopted to prevent the dumping of goods from countries with the lowest currency prices in order to hope for successful modification of the war debt agreements. According to several congressmen, the main obstacle to modifying war debts at present is the extreme devaluation of currencies, which has led to a sharp increase in the exports of nations. Friends of President Hoover have also voiced identical opinions today, stating that President Hoover believes that the current decline in global prices is due to currency devaluation. This issue must be dealt with quickly and effectively, after which the economy will have hope for recovery. Renay, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, also stated that he is unwilling to pay attention to any war debt modification proposal that does not include organizing currency prices and other factors that hinder the advancement of commerce. As Renay is known as a leader of the faction opposing discussion of war debt modification, the public believes Renay's attitude has made a noticeable concession. However, Renay still opposes the method of settling with a lump sum, especially opposing the issuance of such bonds in the United States, stating that he believes this method is meaningless. Senator Borah, who has always advocated complete cancellation of war debts, has also reiterated his position, stating that if the current issues restricting international trade are not organized first, then proceeding directly with canceling the war debts would not be helpful to either the debtor nations or the United States. As for the lump-sum settlement method, it will also not necessarily bring permanent benefits, because we must first find markets and restore the purchasing power of the people, and then can war debts be satisfactorily organized.</p>

<p>As for the discussions on the situation of war debts by key figures in the British government, little has been heard here. American official circles believe that the British will first carefully consider all aspects and then make concrete proposals to the American Democratic Party government.</p>
<p>London, Reuters, 8th Today, the Cabinet Committee reported to the full Cabinet meeting on the results of the Committee's discussions with the British Ambassador to the United States, Sir Ronald Lindsay, on the war debt issue. The Cabinet Committee held another discussion with Sir Ronald Lindsay this afternoon. According to the Committee, the understanding of American public opinion on war debts obtained by Sir Ronald is extremely valuable, and the relationship between Sir Ronald and President-elect Roosevelt is also extremely important for the Cabinet's preparations to deal with the future war debt conference.</p>

<p>Hitler States He Will Not Suppress Public Opinion</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 9th—Since Hitler assumed the position of Prime Minister, political conflicts have erupted in various parts of Germany, resulting in a death toll that has now reached thirty-four. Yesterday, two more individuals succumbed to their injuries. Although no serious conflicts have occurred in the past twenty-four hours, unrest persists in various locations. In the town of Wilsen, two members of the National Socialist Party, who severely injured two police officers during a street fight, have been expelled from the party. There is widespread speculation that the Communist Party and the Socialist Party may form a labor alliance to resist the common enemy of Fascism. However, reaching a consensus on the overall strategy of this policy is proving difficult for both parties. The Communist Party advocates for an immediate general strike, even if it results in bloodshed, while the Socialist Party seeks only to utilize the propaganda tools permitted by the government and to strive to compete against their political opponents in the upcoming general election.</p>
<p>National Society, Berlin, 8th—Prime Minister Hitler met with several prominent German and foreign journalists this afternoon to explain the government's intention to restrict the freedom of the press. He denied claims that the government intends to suppress public opinion, adding that the newspapers of the National Socialist Party have been suspended more times than probably any other newspaper. He concluded by stating that Marxism would no longer exist in Germany after ten years. All actions of the current government are premised on the nation's interests. Anyone willing to cooperate in saving the motherland can rest assured that he will not resign until his mission is accomplished.</p>

<p>Parties Fear Offending Military, Decide to Agree Conditionally</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th—The deliberations of the House of Representatives' Budget Subcommittee concluded yesterday. To decide their stance on the budget proposal, the Seiyukai Party held a joint meeting of executives and budget committee members at the Shiba San'entei this morning. The Minseito Party and the Kokumin Domei Party also held discussions within the Diet. As each faction intends to approve the proposal without amendments, after the discussions and decisions by the subcommittees this morning, the final budget plenary session will be held at 2:00 PM to make a final decision. It is anticipated that the budget proposal will be submitted to the main session at 1:00 PM on the 13th for discussion and passage.</p>
<p>Hualian News Agency, Tokyo, 9th—Japanese political parties held representative meetings today to discuss their stance on the military budget. It is reported that the Seiyukai Party has decided not to make any amendments but will unanimously pass it with the following hopes: (1) [Financial Issues] The government must fundamentally address national defense issues and reorganize the financial and tax systems to ensure financial stability. (2) [Industrial Issues] The government should promote industry, stabilize exchange rates, implement low-interest rate policies, and pursue inflationary policies to facilitate the smooth flow of capital in the financial sector. (3) [Other] It is deeply hoped that the government will take a fair stance in resolving the Meiji Sugar tax evasion issue and devise caring countermeasures.</p>
<p>The Minseito Party's representative meeting also resolved to pass the budget proposal without attaching conditions. Their key hopes are as follows: 1. Implement market control policies to prevent inflationary policies from becoming extreme and guard against exchange rate declines. 2. To consolidate finances, the government must reorganize the financial and tax systems. 3. For deficit bonds, a separate fixed source of revenue must be found as a debt repayment fund to maintain the credit of public bonds.</p>
<p>The demands of the two parties are not significantly different. The massive new budget is likely to pass safely through the Lower House on February 13. Japanese political parties dare not express the slightest dissent towards the new budget for fear of offending the military, which might prevent them from gaining power in the future.</p>
<p>Dentsu News Agency, Tokyo, 9th—At 2:30 PM today, the Kokumin Domei Party held a meeting of Diet members to exchange opinions on the budget proposal. The results of the discussion were as follows: The government budget is fundamentally contrary to the Kokumin Domei's economic policies, but in light of the current situation, it is conditionally approved. Furthermore, at the main session on the 13th, Kato Choichi and Koyamadani Zo will take the stage to explain the party's position in detail and express their support.</p>

<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 9th—A Japanese naval airship, the largest of its kind, crashed in Tokyo Bay last night while carrying ten people. The engine suddenly malfunctioned as the airship was flying over Tokyo Bay, causing it to fall into the sea. Three officers drowned, while the remaining seven managed to climb out of the airship and swim to shore.</p>
<p>Reuters, Tokyo, 9th—The crashed airship was ordered from Britain and was the largest of all Japanese airships. It was destroyed while landing 350 yards from the coast. The aircraft was named Airship No. 2 and could accommodate eleven people. Of the seven survivors, three were injured.</p>
<p>Japan United News Agency, Tokyo, 9th—The Tateyama Naval Air Station conducted a night flight training exercise starting at 5:00 PM on the 8th. Around 7:00 PM, Japan's largest naval airship, Type 90, crashed during landing 300 meters northwest of Tateyama Bay due to negligent piloting, causing significant damage to the airframe. Among the crew members, three are missing. The Japanese Navy has three Type 90 airships, one of which was destroyed in Tateyama Bay during a typhoon last autumn. This is the second loss.</p>

<h3 id="e99">Blood Brotherhood Reveals Inside Story (Japan Communication) <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Japan's expansion of territory, its conquests, whether viewed from a nationalistic or capitalistic standpoint, cannot be denied as a blessing to the Japanese Empire. Why then do cries of "national crisis" resound throughout Japan? The proliferation of the leftist Communist Party within Japanese society undoubtedly poses a significant danger, threatening to fundamentally destabilize Japan. However, the Communist Party has always been an illegal entity, subject to severe crackdowns by the police and oppression by various right-wing groups, including the veterans' associations. Therefore, while the Communist Party is indeed a serious problem in Japan and poses various obstacles to the rule of the Japanese militarists, its practical manifestations, at most, only present a threat to the Japanese imperialist regime, a mere ideological threat with no actual rebellious actions sufficient to endanger Japanese politics. Where, then, does the so-called national crisis lie?</p>
<p>Everyone knows that since Japan abandoned the gold standard and adopted an "inflationary policy," industry seems to have been slightly invigorated by rising prices. However, the general populace has suffered even greater hardships due to these rising prices. Consequently, cries of "economic downturn" are heard everywhere in the cities, and the plight of the rural areas worsens daily. The pressure of difficult living conditions has left the masses of farmers barely able to breathe. Therefore, people of all persuasions, whether leftist or rightist (excluding the ruling military elite and a small number of aristocrats), express extreme dissatisfaction with the current state of affairs.</p>
<p>This dissatisfaction with the status quo is prevalent among the general population and even among junior officers in the active-duty army and navy. Among these groups, the most formidable and potent collective force is the Blood Brotherhood. Over the past year, the "Blood Brotherhood" has indeed been a monster in Japan, an enigma difficult for Japanese society to decipher. Although we know that this is a right-wing group, a collective operating under the direction of the military, its content and actions are unknown to the general public.</p>
<p>Unknown to most, the central figure leading the Blood Brotherhood is a Buddhist monk. Under his guidance, in addition to those directly involved in action, there are many active-duty junior officers from the army and navy. Therefore, their tools have a source, and their comrades have safe places to hide. The leader of the Blood Brotherhood, named Inoue Akira (also known as Nissho), has as its core tenet of unity:</p>
<p>"The current state of our country (Japan) has many shortcomings in terms of ideology, economy, and other institutions. Political parties, financial cliques, and other privileged classes collude with each other, satisfying their selfish desires and pursuing their private interests, thereby neglecting the great cause of national survival and disrupting national governance. Therefore, we must seek its reform..."</p>
<p>Such statements have resonated with a segment of the population, evoking sympathy among a portion of the youth. In a Japanese society long accustomed to peace and plagued by economic hardship, it can indeed spark a kind of rebellious action. Thus, last year, during the height of the Shanghai War and as the election campaign was about to begin, former Finance Minister Inoue Junnosuke was suddenly assassinated. Barely a month later, Mitsui's loyal servant, Baron Dan Takuma, was also assassinated. Prime Minister Inukai Tsuyoshi was even killed at his official residence. All of these incidents are directly related to the Blood Brotherhood. Moreover, their planned killings were not limited to these numbers. According to the Japanese government's publicly released information, the list of figures the Blood Brotherhood intended to assassinate is as follows:</p>
<p>Assassinated:</p>
<p>Inukai Tsuyoshi (Former President of the Seiyukai Party, Former Prime Minister)</p>
<p>Inoue Junnosuke (Former Finance Minister, Executive of the Minseito Party)</p>
<p>Dan Takuma (Loyal Servant of Mitsui, Financial Clique)</p>
<p>Not Yet Assassinated:</p>
<p>Saionji Kinmochi (Duke, Elder Statesman)</p>
<p>Shidehara Kijuro (Former Foreign Minister, Son-in-Law of Mitsubishi)</p>
<p>Makino Nobuaki (Current Lord Keeper of the Privy Seal)</p>
<p>Suzuki Kisaburo (Current President of the Seiyukai Party, Former Home Minister)</p>
<p>Tokonami Takejiro (Elder Statesman of the Seiyukai Party, Former Railway Minister, Home Minister)</p>
<p>Wakatsuki Reijiro (Former President of the Minseito Party, Former Prime Minister)</p>
<p>Maeda Toshisada (Count, Elder Statesman, Former Minister of Agriculture and Commerce)</p>
<p>Tokugawa Iesato (Duke, President of the House of Peers)</p>
<p>Ikeda Seihin (Director of Mitsui)</p>
<p>Go Seinosuke (President of Tokyo Electric Light Company, Member of the House of Peers)</p>
<p>Mitsui Hachiroemon (Baron, Representative of Mitsui Gomei)</p>
<p>Kimura Hisayata (Executive Director of Mitsubishi Goshi)</p>
<p>Kagami Kenkichi (President of Nippon Yusen, Member of the Mitsubishi Board of Directors)</p>
<p>Iwasaki Koyata (Baron, President of Mitsubishi Goshi)</p>
<p>Sumitomo Kichizaemon (Baron, President of Sumitomo Goshi)</p>
<p>Okura Kihachiro (Baron, President of Okura Gumi)</p>
<p>Yasuda Zenjiro (President of Yasuda Shoji)</p>
<p>The above twenty individuals were the targets of the Blood Brotherhood's assassination plot. However, in reality, only three were killed before their leader was arrested. But their method involved one comrade killing one of their "targets." Although fourteen people have now been arrested, the foundations they secretly planted in the army, navy, and general society still exist, and their background has not been eliminated. It is feared that the unrest in Japanese society will not necessarily turn from danger to safety due to the arrest of a portion of the Blood Brotherhood. Moreover, the military is "exhausting its resources in military pursuits," sending people to the front lines in waves, further exacerbating the people's suffering. (February 4, Tokyo)</p>

<p>Feng Yuxiang Resolves to Resist Japan, Will Come to Beijing Soon</p>
<p>Special Envoy Huang Shaogu Informs the Central Government of His Opinions</p>
<p>North China's Situation Becomes Increasingly Urgent, Military and Civilians Unite in Resistance</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Faqin, specially appointed by the Central Government to go to Zhangjiakou to urge Feng Yuxiang to come to Beijing to jointly resist foreign aggression, returned to Beijing from Ping at 8:00 AM on the 8th. Accompanying him was Huang Shaogu, Feng Yuxiang's representative. After entering the city, they did not stay at the Central Hotel. Central figures such as Zhang Ji, Liu Shouzhong, and Zhao Piqian all visited them. In the afternoon, an important discussion was held. According to Mr. Wang's account of the situation in North China and Feng Yuxiang's attitude, he stated briefly: 1. Mr. Feng expressed to me that as long as the Central Government resists violence and relieves the national crisis, he is willing to make any sacrifice. Because he was originally a Central Committee member, a National Government Committee member, and a Military Affairs Committee member, he bears a major responsibility to the country and the people. Since the 9/18 and 1/28 incidents occurred and continue to this day, he has long been determined to resist Japan and save the country. Mr. Feng is currently in Zhangjiakou, and I also met with him in Zhangjiakou. It has now been decided that he will come to Beijing, but the date of departure is undecided, but it should not be far off. At this moment, he has specially appointed Huang Shaogu as his representative to accompany me to Beijing to inform the Central Government of various opinions. As for what task and title the Central Government will give Mr. Feng, this matter is being carefully considered by the Central Government and has not yet been concretely decided. Mr. Feng himself has no demands or conditions. However, the Central Government must give him a practical and appropriate task and title so that Mr. Feng can do his best to serve the country. This is a matter of fact. In my opinion, since Mr. Feng is determined to resist Japan, the Central Government should give him the task of resisting Japan so that Mr. Feng can be happy to accept it, and the Central Government can also achieve twice the result with half the effort. As for the recent situation in North China, in my observation, Japan is determined to take Rehe. The situation in North China is becoming increasingly urgent, but the military and civilians, both high and low, are determined to resist. This is a good phenomenon. There are two points that prove the psychology of national self-determination: (1) The army is united in heart and mind, waiting only for the order to move out and can depart at any time without any hesitation. (2) Although military pay is insufficient, there are many donations from all sides to aid and support the country. Even officers of all ranks are willing to empty their pockets and contribute their private savings to cover expenses, with no instance of loving money and forgetting the country. When I was in Beiping, I met with many important generals in North China, and I also made detailed inquiries among the people. From Zhang Hanqing to peddlers, all hold the determination to rather be a shattered jade than a whole tile.] Mr. Wang also stated that since Huang Shaogu represents Mr. Feng, he will first go to Gan to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to convey Mr. Feng's intentions.</p>

<p>Yesterday (the 9th) morning, four bandit ships carrying more than thirty bandits and equipped with box guns and other weapons were discovered near Tingzi Port in Suzhou. They intended to rob nearby villages. After police detectives learned of this, the Water Public Security Bureau dispatched a team to pursue and suppress them. However, since the area is close to Taihu Lake, the pursuit is proving difficult.</p>

<p>The Suzhou-Changshu Road in this area was ordered to be built by the Construction Department in mid-March of last year, with the Construction Bureau of this area and Wu County jointly undertaking the construction. Work began immediately, starting with the construction of bridges. Currently, the bridges in the Changshu section have been completed. The entire road is approximately ninety li long, with this area responsible for fifty li, including the construction of twenty-seven bridges, the largest of which is twenty-eight meters long, and the smallest fifteen meters. However, the road surface has not yet been paved, so it is not yet open to traffic. Because the Construction Bureau will be ordered to merge, they rushed to complete the roadbed earthworks and culverts. Yesterday, Director Gu telegraphed the county government, requesting that it be forwarded to the Construction Department for the rapid dispatch of personnel to Changshu for acceptance and inspection.</p>

<p>The Grain Management Committee of this area held a committee meeting yesterday in the county government conference room. Li Tiping, Feng Junyan, Zhao Zixin, Wang Li, Chen Zhanru, and others attended, chaired by Chen Chuande. Matters discussed included: (1) This county previously planned to collect five cents per mu for grain storage expenses, but it was ordered to be reviewed and it conflicted with the one-hundredth limit. Another method of raising funds was suggested. Please immediately consider and draft a proposal for approval. (2) A letter from the fifth section of the Civil Affairs Department, transferred by the county government, contained an electric message from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, ordering each province to report the details of grain storage by the end of January for dispatching personnel to check. The above two cases were discussed together. It was resolved that, upon examination, the suggested method of raising funds involved complex procedures and was difficult to implement. A letter was still sent to the county government, requesting that the original proposal to continue collecting grain storage expenses per mu be approved. Before approval is received, in order to cope with emergencies, the committee sent a letter to the County Funds Property Office, requesting that the surplus funds from the flood relief committee last year, which were raised to repair dikes, be reallocated from the relief funds for each district, totaling more than 26,000 yuan, to be collected in full as soon as possible. It also requested the county government to withdraw four-tenths of the two-five treasury bond items from each district and allocate them to grain storage expenses. After the funds are received, grain will be purchased and stored immediately.</p>

<p>Luo Talks about the Sino-Dutch Boxer Indemnity Negotiations in Progress</p>
<p>Agreement to Extend the Special District Court for Three Years</p>
<p>Song Returned to Beijing Last Night, Luo Returns Today</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Luo Wengan arrived in Shanghai by train from Beijing at 5:50 PM yesterday. Yu Ming, Director of the Foreign Ministry's Shanghai Office, and Section Chief Zhao Zhang and others personally welcomed him at the station. Mr. Luo alighted from the train and went directly to the Song residence on Qiqi Road to meet with Acting Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen to inquire about diplomatic matters, financial matters, and dined at the Song residence, talking at length until after 10:00 PM, when Luo took his leave and returned to his residence to rest. This newspaper's reporter visited Mr. Luo last night to inquire about recent diplomatic issues. Mr. Luo's remarks are divided as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e107">Coming to Shanghai to Visit Song <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Luo first stated that his visit to Shanghai was solely to meet with Acting Executive Yuan President Song Ziwen to discuss important matters. Since Mr. Song has been delayed in Shanghai due to illness for two weeks without meeting, he had no choice but to come in person to report everything. However, the political affairs in Nanjing are also complex and numerous, and it is inconvenient to stay in Shanghai for a long time, so he plans to return to the capital tomorrow (today).</p>
<h3 id="e108">Yan Will Arrive Shortly <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Luo also stated that regarding the League of Nations, our chief representative, Dr. Yan Huiqing, has been reporting to the Foreign Ministry via telegram at any time. Dr. Yan will depart for Moscow to assume his post as Ambassador to Russia after the meeting closes. When the reporter asked whether the League of Nations' handling of the Sino-Japanese dispute would yield substantial results, Mr. Luo smiled slightly without saying anything.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Dutch Boxer Indemnity Negotiations <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then inquired about the Dutch return of the Boxer Indemnity. The minister has been negotiating with Dutch Envoy Du Rijck in Beijing. Can the results be heard? He replied that regarding the Sino-Dutch Boxer Indemnity issue, negotiations have been held repeatedly in Beijing. The country advocates that the use of the returned indemnity should be entirely used for water conservancy projects in Nanjing, such as dredging the Huai River. The Dutch envoy insists that it should be used for the construction of a port in Haizhou. The Dutch envoy has agreed to telegraph his government for instructions. After I return to Beijing, I will continue negotiations with the Dutch envoy.</p>

Mr. Song, accompanied by guards, went to the North Station at 11:20 PM and took the night train back to Beijing at 11:45 PM to resume his duties. According to another source, Foreign Minister Luo's trip to Shanghai, in addition to visiting Song, also had the task of urging Military Affairs Minister He Yingqin to return to Beijing as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Joint Declaration of Ma Xiangbo and Zhang Taiyan <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Using history and anecdotes to prove that the Three Eastern Provinces belong to China</p>
<p>Zhang Taiyan, a master of Chinese classical studies, and Ma Xiangbo, a 94-year-old elder, in view of the League of Nations conference not having reached a resolution on denying the "Manchukuo" state, specifically from the standpoint of Chinese scholars, use historical and anecdotal evidence to prove that the Three Eastern Provinces belong to China. The joint declaration, the full text of which is found below, (it is heard that it will be telegraphed to Geneva to Chief Representative Hui Qing to ask him to announce it to the world):</p>
<p>The Three Eastern Provinces are called Manchuria, but this is only a common name, not the proper name. Manchuria is only a kind of tribe, not the whole of the Three Eastern Provinces. Speaking of ancient history, during the Han Dynasty there already existed Liaodong (now Jinzhou) and Xuantu (now the Eastern Border Region), and in the Ming Dynasty, the Liaodong Regional Military Commission was established, stationed in Shenyang. These were originally inland territories of China, not like vassal states. Considering today's population, there are more than 20 million Han Chinese in the Three Eastern Provinces, and only more than 1 million Manchus. If we talk about national self-determination, the three provinces should belong to the Han people, not to the Manchus. Although the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties entered and ruled China, and Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty signed the Treaty of Nerchinsk with Russia, (among which one kind was in Latin, all recognized as Chinese land), and their ethnicity has long been assimilated with China. It is still remembered that during the Xianfeng era, Western historians recorded that there were special deer in Chinese Sakhalin Island used to pull carts and cultivate land. Until the Tongzhi era, the island still presented sable pelts, etc. There is no doubt that the Three Eastern Provinces belong to China. Japan's attack on the Three Eastern Provinces clearly knew that the taking was not rightful, so they evaded the charge, calling it self-defense. This was also unacceptable, so they embellished the crime and created the "Manchukuo" state. The people did not submit, and thus there were the Volunteer Armies. Is this not plainly a fabrication?</p>
<p>It is reported that this action, being a joint declaration to the outside world by first-class Chinese scholars, will be able to represent their thousands of disciples, famous professors, scientists, and people in education who are currently serving, to make a public announcement to the world in support of China's inherent sovereignty, proving that the Three Eastern Provinces should belong to China. It is hoped that all compatriots in the country will rise up to save themselves.</p>

<p>All Sectors Respond to Saving the Nation Through Aviation</p>
<p>Ge Jing'en, Director of the Aviation Administration, because all sectors are very enthusiastic about the movement to save the nation through aviation, in order to plan for aviation construction by civil aviation organizations and aviation authorities, and to have unified steps, specially left Hangzhou the day before yesterday (the 8th) at around 9 a.m. He arrived in Shanghai at 2 p.m. and immediately drove to Mayor Wu's residence to discuss matters in detail with Mr. Wu. Lin Xijiang, executive director of the China Aviation Association, had already been waiting at the Wu residence. After a while, he visited the executive directors of the Aviation Association, Wang Zhengting, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, Lin Kanghou, and others, and also met with the former Director of the Aviation Administration, Zhang Huichang, to discuss the construction policy of aviation national defense. Yesterday morning, the executive directors of the Aviation Association again talked with Mr. Ge, and also met with the former Director of the Aviation Administration, Huang Bingheng, for detailed discussions. He took a car back to Hangzhou at about 3 p.m. Before leaving, he told reporters briefly that before the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95, the tonnage of our country's navy was ranked fourth in the world. It was not that we didn't work hard on construction, but because there was no meticulous plan and we expanded blindly, so the entire army was wiped out in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-95. Today, in building the air force, we must learn from the mistakes of the navy, and there must be a meticulous plan in advance. This time, I met with the two former Directors, Zhang and Huang. Both of them are aviation experts, and they gave sincere advice on the choices of the aviation construction policy, which was very beneficial. He discussed with the directors of the Aviation Association the policy of the government and the people working together, so that the government and people's organizations can understand each other, and the facilities will naturally tend to be consistent. The future of aviation construction is very promising. The result of my trip was very good.</p>

<p>Hu Rihua, a trainee at the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank at 64 Hankou Road, yesterday donated a monthly salary of nine yuan and sent a letter to Mayor Wu, which said, "Respected Mayor of Iron City, remembering the violent Japanese invading Shanghai, the airplanes wreaked havoc, the essence of the whole city turned to ashes, and the suffering of the people was beyond description. Now that the pain has subsided, we should make efforts in aviation to save the country as the most urgent task at hand. I am delighted to hear that you, sir, have risen up in a timely manner, initiated the movement to save the nation through aviation, organized associations, and raised huge sums of money. All of us Chinese people should unanimously support it and save ourselves from danger together. I am a trainee at the Shanghai Silk Industry Bank, with little wealth and ability, but witnessing the inhumanity of the violent Japanese, my heart has long been cut like a knife. I dare not lag behind others in my humble heart to save the nation. Therefore, I have worked hard to collect five yuan from my monthly salary and respectfully offer it for the purchase of airplanes. I know that this small amount is of no practical help, but as the ancient saying goes, ['Trickles do not refuse to join rivers, and fine dust does not refuse to form mountains.'] If all compatriots in the country who are in the same situation as I can donate this amount, it will not be difficult to purchase an airplane to fly to the Three Islands to kill the enemy and serve the country. I am overwhelmed and cannot express all that I want to say. I respectfully wish you good health. Sincerely, Hu Rihua."</p>

<p>Gao Weisong, the car driver of Mr. Wang Xiaolai, donated ten yuan yesterday, and sent a letter to Mayor Wu saying, "Mr. Mayor, I am the car driver of Mr. Wang Xiaolai. The other day, I saw in the newspaper vivid accounts of the loss of Yuguan, the emergency at Jiugmenkou, and the bombing by enemy planes. After reading them, I felt very angry and heartbroken. As the ancients said, 'The rise and fall of a country is the responsibility of every citizen.' People like me, living in this world, cannot contribute to the country, and I am truly ashamed. Therefore, I am now donating ten silver yuan saved from my hard-earned money to the Aviation Association, and I also ask you, sir, to persuade car drivers in all industries to jointly donate a sum of money to purchase a fighter plane, named 'Shanghai Automotive Drivers No. 1,' and use it to attack the Japanese imperialists. I am only twenty years old now, and I hope to become an aviation driver in the future, go to the front line and kill all the unreasonable and inhuman Japanese dwarfs. I am willing to sacrifice everything to fulfill my duty as a member of the great Chinese nation. Donor, Gao Weisong, respectfully."</p>
<h3 id="e119">Absolute Freedom to Transfer National Troops within Our Territory <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Japanese Representative Lodges Unreasonable Protest with City Government Yesterday</p>
<p>Our Representative Has Refuted Sternly Based on the Ceasefire Agreement</p>
<p>China Internal News Agency reports that the Japanese representative of the Joint Committee, Consul General Ishii, and Naval Lieutenant Commander Kakuda, visited the Shanghai Municipal Government at 11 a.m. yesterday to see the representative of our side, Secretary General of the Municipal Government Yu Hongjun. Regarding the passage of Chinese troops through Shanghai on the evening of the 7th, they considered it to be a violation of the ceasefire agreement of May 5, 1932, specifically questioned it, and lodged a protest. Secretary General Yu answered that Article 3 of the ceasefire agreement stipulates, "Before a method for the normal recovery of Chinese troops in the area involved in this agreement has been decided, the troops will remain in their current positions." However, the Chinese troops referred to in this agreement refer only to the Chinese troops fighting the Japanese army at that time. When the Japanese army withdrew, this provision was made to avoid conflicts. Therefore, the so-called "Chinese troops" in this agreement cannot include other Chinese troops, otherwise all Chinese troops will be bound by this agreement, which is unreasonable. The Japanese interpretation is neither legal nor reasonable. In short, the Chinese government has absolute freedom and sovereignty to transfer troops within Chinese territory and is not subject to interference from any party. Therefore, China not only considers the troop movements on the 7th not to be a violation of the agreement, but also considers them to be unrelated to the agreement. Firstly, even if we take a step back and acknowledge the Japanese representative's interpretation of Article 2 of the ceasefire agreement (but it is impossible to acknowledge it in fact or in theory), this clause can only be applied before the normal state of the area involved in the agreement has been restored. Now the normal state of the area has long been restored, and it is of course not applicable. Secondly, the Japanese side has repeatedly expressed its desire to restore Sino-Japanese relations. It is regrettable that they are now taking this attitude. They should consider it. At this point, Ishii argued slightly, but ultimately ran out of words, agreed to reconsider, and left.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Initially, When Abandoning Taels and Adopting Yuan, Taels and Yuan Will Be Temporarily Allowed to Be Used Together <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Regulate Exchange Rate, Silver Taels Will Be Abolished When They Are Used Up</p>
<p>Those Holding Silver Taels Can Freely Request to Mint New Coins</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of abandoning taels and adopting yuan, the Ministry of Finance has decided to implement it on March 1. The money industry will also be changed to the yuan standard at the same time. In the initial implementation, silver yuan and silver taels will be used together. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Weight and Fineness of New Currency <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with leaders in the banking industry. According to them, after the Ministry of Finance decided to abandon taels and adopt yuan, the weight of the currency will be 16.6971 grams (equivalent to 7 mace and 2 candareens of Kuping taels), and the fineness will be 88, with 23.493448 grams of pure silver (equivalent to 6 mace, 3 candareens, and 1 li of Kuping taels).</p>
<h3 id="e122">Taels and Yuan Temporarily Allowed to Be Used Together <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>When abandoning taels and adopting yuan, in the initial implementation, in order to take into account the difficulties in converting silver taels into silver yuan for various industries, the Ministry of Finance has specifically stipulated that the legal silver yuan price is 7 mace and 1.5 candareens, and the silver tael price is 1 yuan and 4 jiao. In the initial implementation, silver yuan and taels will be allowed to be used together until the silver taels are used up.</p>

<p>Among the Chinese banks, those issuing silver tael banknotes are now only the Bank of Communications. Among the foreign banks are the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Chartered Bank, etc. After the abandonment of taels is implemented, the banknotes issued will be canceled. Regarding the implementation of silver tael clearing and silver tael remittances by the bank clearing house, it is heard that it will be submitted to the committee for discussion and cessation.</p>

According to the Third Article of the People's Republic Ordinance, pure silver is 6 mace and 4.8 candareens, 23.9775048 grams, and the fineness is 89, but it has not been minted. The Sun Yat-sen coins and Yuan Shikai coins currently circulating in the country have been minted to an amount of over 300 million yuan.</p>

<p>The League for the Protection of Civil Rights Cannot Be Called Illegal</p>
<p>Since Madam Sun Yat-sen, Soong Ching-ling, and Cai Yuanpei, among others, initiated the organization of the China League for Civil Rights, the people of the country have been very sympathetic to this organization. However, when the Peiping branch of the League was established on the 30th of last month, the Peiping Municipal Party Department sent letters to the Municipal Government, etc., considering it an illegal organization and asking them not to accept any requests from the League. Yesterday, regarding this matter, the reporter specifically visited Cai Yuanpei, vice chairman of the League, at the Academia Sinica to inquire about his attitude towards this matter. According to him, the organization of this League is based on the rights given to the people by the Provisional Constitution. The purpose of the organization of this League is to protect human rights and promote the rule of law. Its purpose is pure and its attitude is open and aboveboard. It absolutely cannot be called "illegal." On the contrary, all opposition to the League's claims is "illegal." Furthermore, in terms of facts, when the Peiping Municipal Party Department sent a letter to the Municipal Government, denying the establishment of the Peiping branch of the League (January 31), the League had already received an official letter from the Peiping Municipal Government regarding the rescue of anti-Japanese youths in Peiping. This shows that the League has already been recognized as a proper and legitimate organization in fact.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Xingfo was also present. Mr. Yang also said that the previous news reports about his speech, saying that the "Anti-Imperialist League" would send representatives to the Far East to investigate the Manchurian Incident, was actually a mistake for the "World Anti-War Conference" and should be corrected. The conference is organized by scholars from all over the world and will investigate the Manchurian Incident from a position of justice and fairness.</p>

<p>The China League for the Protection of Civil Rights yesterday sent a telegram to Han Fuju, Chairman of Shandong Province, requesting the release of Yuan Chunting and more than 30 other people arrested on suspicion of participating in the Kuomintang Action Committee, and sent a telegram to the Ministry of Communications to release postal workers arrested in Peiping for resisting Japan, and to punish Ba Lidi, the postmaster who abused his power. Yesterday, the League also received an explanation from the Peiping Municipal Government regarding the arrest of anti-Japanese students, which is also recorded on the left.</p>

<p>"Respected Chairman Han of Jinan, according to the report from Feng Junwu and others from Shandong residing in Peiping, their friends Yuan Chunting, Xu Zhe, Pu Lan, Xin Renli, Zian, Lv Zibin, Zhao Tianze, and more than 30 others were arrested in Shandong in April last year on suspicion of participating in the Kuomintang Action Committee and have been subjected to torture and interrogation and are still being held by the military law review committee. It is said that the Kuomintang Action Committee has long been eliminated. Therefore, it is hoped that those arrested, such as Yuan Chunting, will be released immediately or given a fair and public trial in accordance with the law to uphold human rights and fairness. Chairman Song Qingling and Cai Yuanpei of the China League for the Protection of Civil Rights."</p>

<p>"Respected Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications in Nanjing, according to a letter from the Peiping Postal Workers' Union, the Peiping Postmaster Ba Lidi colluded with military police on January 2 to detain 12 executive committee members of the Union's Anti-Japanese Association. They have not been brought before the court or released. Since postal workers are also citizens, how can they be guilty of resisting Japan? Human rights are clearly recorded in the law, and arbitrary trampling is especially inappropriate. It is hoped that the Peiping authorities will be immediately ordered to release the detained postal workers and that Postmaster Ba Lidi, who abused his power, will be punished to uphold civil rights. Chairman Song Qingling and Cai Yuanpei of the China League for the Protection of Civil Rights."</p>
<h3 id="e129">Collision Between Two Jiangnan Vessels <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>"Ningbo" and "Taiping" Vessels Collide Head-On</p>
<p>Ten or More Sha Ships and Civilian Vessels Suffer</p>
<p>Many Boatmen and Passengers Drowned</p>
<p>At about 12:00 noon yesterday, the "Ningbo" steamship of the Taikoo Company, after leaving the Yitaixing Wharf in Dongjiadu, Pudong, after unloading coal, suddenly collided head-on with the "Taiping" steamship. The "Taiping" vessel immediately reversed, then moved forward again, intending to stop the vessel, but unexpectedly damaged six sand ships moored along the Pudong waterfront, and sank two rowing boats, one yellow vegetable boat, and one sailing vessel. The number of boatmen and passengers drowned is estimated to be more than thirty. The results of the investigation are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Circumstances of the Accident <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>South of Dongjiadu, south of the Pudong waterfront, in addition to various civilian vessels usually moored, there are also various sand ships, numbering several hundred, divided into rows of seven or eight, moored in sequence. At about 12:00 noon yesterday, the "Ningbo" steamship, after unloading the coal it transported at the Yitaixing Coal Depot in Pudong, raised anchor and sailed north. At that time, the "Taiping" steamship was speeding south, intending to turn around there to enter and moor at the wharf. The two vessels collided head-on with slight carelessness. But hearing a loud bang, after the bows of the two vessels came into contact, the bow of the "Ningbo" vessel skewed towards Pudong. The "Taiping" vessel turned and sped diagonally towards Puxi. The engineers on the "Taiping" urgently reversed, but then went forward again, wanting to correct the vessel's position before proceeding. Unexpectedly, the bow of the vessel skewed directly towards the Puxi side, and collided with the Shandong sand ships moored there. After the sand ships were hit, they shifted to the side. Several other sand ships parked next to them, unable to withstand the pressure, all shifted backwards. The row of sand ships behind, having been squeezed by the sand ships in front, also fell back along with the force. They fell in sequence until they stopped at the Santae Wharf. Among them, the sand ships that were hit and damaged on the bow, stern, and body due to the pressure numbered six in total. About a dozen others were slightly damaged. There were also two rowing boats, one yellow vegetable boat, and one sailing vessel, all crushed by the sand ships.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Capsizing Vessels and Injuring People <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>At the time, because the rowing boats and other vessels were small, they were unable to save the sand ships, resulting in them all being crushed and sinking to the bottom of the river. When the rowing boats capsized, the passengers and boatmen on board, numbering more than fifty, all drowned with the vessels. Seeing this, neighboring vessels rushed forward to try to rescue them. The water patrol team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, hearing the alarm, also dispatched police officers Jiang Bin, Zhang Kefeng, and others to make efforts to rescue them. As a result, only a dozen boatmen were rescued. More than thirty others could not be rescued and drowned tragically. Their bodies floated away without a trace. According to statistics, the losses suffered by each vessel were numerous. Among them, the most severely affected was the sailing vessel. The sailing vessel was moored near the Laiyi Wharf and had loaded more than twenty passengers yesterday, setting sail at about 12:00 noon. At that time, it happened to encounter the sand ship squeeze, resulting in it being immediately hit and overturned. All the passengers on board fell into the water. Only five or six people were rescued on the spot. Among them, Sun Guanxi, although rescued, suffered serious injuries. He was sent to the Shanghai Hospital for treatment, and it is said that his life may be in danger. After the two rowing boats sank, only one boatman was rescued. After the yellow vegetable boat sank, everyone on board drowned completely, without a single survivor. As for the sand ships, Yang Hua Da's vessel had a giant hole smashed into its stern, with a diameter of over two feet. Yang Junchen's vessel had a huge hole smashed into its waist, and water quickly entered the bottom of the vessel. Six or seven other vessels of unknown names had their bows and sterns smashed in to varying degrees.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Aftermath <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>After the incident, the "Ningbo" steamship of the Taikoo Company, although it collided with the "Taiping" steamship, its bow was not damaged, so it continued to sail north. The bow of the "Taiping" vessel was damaged, so it sailed to the Pudong China Wharf to moor for repairs. However, more than twenty boatmen and others who sank to the bottom of the river had not yet surfaced as of 7:00 p.m. It was only heard that a drowned corpse, already divided into two sections, had been recovered from the Pudong waterfront near the South Wharf. It was indeed tragic.</p>

<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special District Court Agreement expires on April 1. Regarding the issue of modification after the expiration, the British Ambassador Lampson and the Dutch Minister Dr. Beelaerts van Blokland have exchanged views with Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Mo in Beijing. According to a Beijing telegram yesterday, the agreement will continue to be effective and need not be modified. However, the British side has requested improvements regarding the slow court proceedings and the inability to immediately enforce civil judgments. In order to understand the details of the case, the reporter specifically visited Zhang Dachun, chief clerk of the Special District Court, yesterday morning. According to him, the court has not yet received a part regarding whether the Shanghai Special District Court Agreement will continue to be effective, only seeing reports. As for the inability to immediately enforce civil judgments, this was a matter from last spring, and we have been working hard to improve. Since the appointment of President Shen Jiaxuan, we have been working hard to find ways to reform in order to satisfy all parties.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Disputes Over Water Fee Issues: Water Company Proposes Alternative Solution <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Real Estate Association Requests Three Items, Ningbo Compatriot Association Sends Letter Requesting Negotiation</p>
<p>The National News Agency reports that the Shanghai Waterworks Company, a British company, has changed its water meters, and the water fees have exceeded the previous price by seven or eight times. The Real Estate Association has therefore resolved to refuse to pay unanimously, and the company has implemented water cuts, causing conflicts with users. The reporter visited both sides yesterday and learned that the company has proposed an alternative solution. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Real Estate Association Says Water Fee Exceeds Rent <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>According to Dou Yaoting, a representative of the Real Estate Association, who spoke to reporters, the water company has always charged water fees according to 6% of the rent, that is, a rent of 100 yuan, a water price of 6 yuan. Later, the water company stipulated that shareholders' interest should be at least 9%, so it was not enough to cover expenses, and it was increased to 7.5% of the rent, charging 7.5 yuan per 100 yuan. Both sides were at peace until June of last year, when the water company suddenly used the excuse that users were overly wasteful, and with the approval of the Public Works Department, changed to installing water meters and charging 6 jiao and 2.5 fen per 1,000 gallons. But after this change, water fees for large mansions and buildings were reduced compared to before (because large mansions have fewer people and use less water), while water fees for commoner residences increased greatly. Especially in places where factories were gathered, even for each building, the rent was only 30 yuan, while the water price was more than 40 yuan. In this way, the landlords not only had no rent, but had to subsidize some. Although the building had twenty or more households, if each person used 10 gallons of water per day, the total monthly amount would be more than 7,000 gallons, and the fee would be quite large. Therefore, the landlords could only unanimously refuse to pay.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Stop Water Cuts, Propose Three Requirements <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Now the water company, disregarding people's lives, is implementing water cuts, and the conflict that occurred the day before yesterday was expected. If it is not resolved, it is inevitable that other more unfortunate incidents will occur. The Real Estate Association has appointed me (Dou himself) as a representative to visit Jones, director of the Public Works Department, to promptly stop this illegal action of the water company. However, yesterday's newspaper reported that I had met with Jones the day before yesterday and talked for half an hour, which is inaccurate. I only had one discussion with the chairman of the Western Property Owners Association. Yesterday afternoon, I went to the Public Works Department with the chairman of the Western Property Owners Association to meet with Jones. First, I requested that the water company no longer continue water cuts to maintain people's lives, and proposed three requirements: (1) It would be best if the previous charge of 7.5% of the rent could be restored; (2) Otherwise, install a water meter for each user (now only one general meter is installed per lane), and the water fee will be borne by the tenants, and the landlord is willing to reduce the rent; (3) Even if the tenants bear the cost, the water company should also reduce the water price to sympathize with the lives of commoners. Later, Jones agreed to discuss it at the Public Utilities Committee before leaving.</p>
<h3 id="e137">The Company Expresses Its Difficulties and Has Proposed an Alternative Solution <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then visited the water company to inquire about everything. A Westerner from the company's business section came out and said that the company installed water meters in accordance with the instructions of the Public Works Department and spent more than 1 million yuan on purchasing these water meters. The reason for the water cuts was that since last June, after the company changed to charging according to the water meter system, the fees for large mansions and buildings were less than before, and real estate companies paid happily. Water fees for commoner residences increased, and the Real Estate Association resolved to refuse to pay unanimously. For more than half a year, not a penny has been collected. If this continues, the company will not be able to maintain it, so it has to take the method of water cuts as a response. But the company also knows that the water price is too high, even more than the rent, and a remedy must be sought. Therefore, the company has now proposed an alternative solution, that is, to base the standard of water price on the level of rent. Assuming the rent is more than 100 yuan, the water fee is 6 jiao per 1,000 gallons, and if it is less than 50 yuan, it is only 3 jiao. But the detailed prices have not yet been determined. The program has been submitted to the Public Works Department to be forwarded to the Real Estate Association. If it can be allowed, other details will be discussed again.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Ningbo Compatriot Association Asks to Open Water Pipes in Ningbo Lane <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The National News Agency reports that the Ningbo Native Place Association of Shanghai, due to the fact that the drinking water needed every day was cut off by the Waterworks Company on the 3rd of this month, the chairman of the Association, Yu Qiaqing, sent a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Ratepayers Association, asking them to negotiate with the Bureau of Works to open the water pipes, etc. The Association immediately forwarded a letter to the Bureau of Works: "To the honorable ones, we are writing to you as per a letter received from Mr. Yu Qiaqing, chairman of the Ningbo Native Place Association of Shanghai: Since the Shanghai Waterworks Company installed water meters, the water fees have been more than doubled compared to before, and therefore the water fees have not been paid to this day. We already sent a letter to your Association on August 5, protesting to the Bureau of Works to reduce the water fees. Half a year has passed and it has not been resolved, and the Waterworks Company has not collected the water fees from our Association. Unexpectedly, on the 3rd of this month, the Waterworks Company suddenly closed the drinking water supply to Ningbo Lane on Lloyd Road, causing panic among the residents. We are writing to ask your Association to quickly negotiate with the Bureau of Works to resolve this issue as soon as possible, reduce the water fees, and formally open the drinking water supply to Ningbo Lane on Lloyd Road to maintain the livelihood of the people.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, everyone knows that people cannot live without water and fire, and that the purpose of water meters is to control waste. The current method of installation only increases the revenue of the water company, which is not in line with the purpose. The water company is not planning on controlling waste and not increasing fees, but instead is cutting off the water to achieve its arbitrary claims, and does not value, or perhaps does not know, the relationship between water and human life. Our Association is extremely worried about public safety. For the reasons stated in the letter above, we are writing to ask your Bureau to quickly order the Waterworks Company to formally turn on the water to maintain people's lives and await a resolution.</p>
<p>And to the Ningbo Native Place Association of Shanghai: We are replying to your letter of February 4 regarding the Waterworks Company's illegal water cut. Upon investigation, water is indispensable to people's daily life, and it hinders both life and fire safety. It seems that the emergency self-defense method that the law does not permit can be adopted. Apart from writing to the Bureau of Works to order the Waterworks Company to formally turn on the water to await a resolution, we are replying accordingly. Please investigate."</p>

<p>Please Note Proof from Two National Goods Organizations</p>
<p>Zhanghua Woolen Mill, Yifeng Enamel Factory, Nanchang Copper Factory, Yaguang Manufacturing Company, Dachina Match Company, Tianchu MSG Factory, Xiaofang Photographic Paper Factory, Zhaofeng French Factory, Guohua Chemical Industry, Zhonghua French Factory, Dafeng Industrial Factory, Huafu Hat Factory, Wuhe Weaving Factory, Ruihe Brick and Tile Factory, Kangcheng Liquor Factory, China Iron Factory, Huayang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Dafeng Raw Material Factory, Huaguo Glass Factory, Shanghai Organ Factory, China Chemical Industry, Dacheng Weaving Factory, Dahua Iron Factory, Ruihe Crucible Factory, and forty-five other national goods factories, jointly sent a letter yesterday to the China National Products Maintenance Association and the Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association, emphasizing merchants who sell goods and requesting proof of national goods. The original letter stated, (part omitted above) Our national goods factories each have a fixed registered trademark, but merchants often like to create their own trademarks and order various goods from national goods factories. There are many types of these trademarks, with no standards at all. Moreover, merchants prioritize profit. Today, they order goods from national goods factories, but if they cannot satisfy their desire for profit due to the cost of raw materials, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not order the same kind of goods from foreign factories tomorrow. Because they first ordered from national goods factories, they also promote their products as national goods. When they later order from foreign factories due to various reasons, they still pretend to sell national goods. This kind of deceptive tactic is seen and heard from time to time, and it is difficult for outsiders to detect. In order to prevent this from happening, the government requires customs to investigate national goods factories every six months to clarify whether the trademarks used are their own products. This method is well-intentioned and thorough. However, it does not treat goods with trademarks created by merchants the same as the national goods factories' own products. Therefore, fearing that these merchants will seek proof from national goods organizations to promote their products, we have jointly stated the contents and sent a letter to your association, requesting that you refuse to provide proof for such goods to avoid being exploited and to protect the interests of national goods factories' own products (part omitted below).</p>

<p>The First and Second Phases are the Implementation Period for the Members Themselves, and the Third Phase is the Expanded Implementation Period</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a notice yesterday, stating, "To Whom It May Concern: The Fourth National Products Promotion Committee of this Chamber discussed the 'Program for Promoting National Products' drafted by Committee Members Wang and Xu and submitted it for public resolution. The original proposed measures included: The first phase is six months, the implementation period for the committee members themselves: (A) Committee members and branch committee members should reduce or eliminate daily necessities related to personal clothing, food, and daily activities, such as decorations and extravagant expenses. Otherwise, for other types of necessities, if national goods can be substituted, they should first be promoted and practiced as an example. (B) At the same time, each branch should conduct a thorough investigation of the national goods and non-national goods components of each industry within these six months, and report to this Chamber. (C) Sales businesses must uniformly mark national goods and non-national goods when selling goods to attract the attention of consumers and make it easy to identify. (D) This Chamber or its branches should organize propaganda sessions and national goods weeks in their affiliated factories, businesses, and organizations to give regular lectures. The second phase is six months, the implementation period for the members' affiliated factories and businesses: (A) Manufacturing industries must substitute national goods for anything that does not harm the quality of the manufactured products. (B) The businesses and shops affiliated with the sales industry should designate one day each week to sell national goods exclusively. The third phase has no fixed time period and is the expanded implementation period. If there are no national goods to substitute for the raw materials and machinery of the manufacturing industry, each industry should find its own way to research and manufacture them. If the strength is insufficient, it should be reported to this Chamber to request joint assistance from each industry. Within a possible scope and a reasonable period, it is necessary to gradually provide domestic products in order to achieve the goal of complete national goods. Secondly, (A) Production aspects are divided into one program: First step: research and reward the export of existing national products; second step: research the manufacturing methods of foreign goods and actively imitate them; third step: research the semi-finished products of imported raw materials. (B) Consumption aspects are divided into two programs: First, request the government to issue a clear order to encourage government agencies, schools, the military, and the public to use national goods and punish them for using foreign goods. Second, request various social groups to encourage ladies from all walks of life to take pride in using national goods and feel ashamed of using foreign goods," etc. The above were discussed and passed, and separate letters were sent to the branch associations of each industry for reference and implementation. In addition to sending separate letters, we are correspondingly recording the case and sending this letter to your association for your review and careful handling.</p>

<p>A Central News Agency report stated that Ma Yubao, former military advisor to the National Government and former military governor of Jiangxi Province, whose courtesy name was Yuanliang, passed away at the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road on the day before yesterday at Maoshi (5-7 AM) due to illness. Mr. Ma was very friendly with Chairman Lin of the National Government and Mayor Wu of this city. They were colleagues who shared hardships during the revolution and were among the first soldiers to respond to the Wuchang Uprising. He was also the first person appointed as military governor by the Premier when he took office as the provisional president. He was honest, simple, and sincere, and truly a revolutionary hero. When Mayor Wu heard the news, he was extremely saddened and has telegraphed the central government and sent personnel to handle the funeral arrangements. The remains have now been sent to the China Funeral Home, and the coffin will be sealed at 11:00 AM on the 11th.</p>

<p>The General Labor Union Specially Sends a Letter to the Chamber of Commerce to Eliminate Disputes and Save the Nation Together</p>
<p>The City General Labor Union believes that labor-management disputes in various industries are greatly hindering the development of industry and affecting social order. Therefore, based on the resolutions of the Second Congress of Representatives, it sent a letter to the City Chamber of Commerce, requesting it to notify all factories and businesses not to close factories or dismiss workers on the pretext of the national crisis. At the same time, it also ordered all labor unions to uphold the spirit of labor-management cooperation and instruct all workers to step up production. The letter to the City Chamber of Commerce is recorded below: "To Whom It May Concern: According to the resolution of the Second Congress of Representatives of this Union, please send a letter to the national goods factories and organizations, and inform all members not to close factories or dismiss workers on the pretext of the national crisis during this national crisis, but to embrace the spirit of labor-management cooperation to save the nation together, etc. According to this, this city's factories and businesses, on the part of the employers, often harbor prejudices and resent workers organizing labor unions, often dismissing workers on pretexts, and even not hesitating to close factories to dismiss workers. Therefore, serious disputes have been caused more than once. If they are not corrected, they will harm the lives of workers and affect social order. In view of the foregoing, in addition to ordering all labor unions to instruct all workers to work hard and increase production in the spirit of labor-management cooperation during this national crisis, we are correspondingly sending a letter to your association to notify all members to implement and cooperate sincerely to eliminate disputes and save the nation. This is our sincere hope. To the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai General Labor Union."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday notified the three sub-offices, the 197 trade associations, and the 22 store members: "Regarding the matter of notification, it has been found that merchants often fail to attach delivery slips to goods delivered to customers due to temporary oversight. This leads to local detectives mistaking them for peddlers and detaining them, which is no small matter as it affects business reputation. In order to ensure commercial safety, this Chamber has specially issued this notification. We hope that all members will, when transporting goods in the future, clearly indicate the quantity of goods and the names and addresses of the recipients on the delivery slip and carry it with the goods to avoid unnecessary complications. This is of utmost importance."</p>

<p>Guangli Crew Members Request Retirement Pay, China Merchants Public School Students Petition Again</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company held its twelfth board meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday. Zhang Chouyong, Ye Zhuotang, Zhang Gongquan, Wang Xiaolai, Liu Hongsheng, Sheng Pingchen, Du Yuesheng, and others attended. Zhang Shouzhang presided over the meeting to discuss important company matters and the direction for business development. When the meeting adjourned at 6:30 PM, the crew members of the Guangli ship, which had been suspended by the company, petitioned for retirement pay, representatives of merchants claiming outstanding debts, and students of the China Merchants Public School petitioned to revoke the decision to close the school. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e145">Guangli Crew Members Petition <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company decided to suspend the Guangli ship because it was old and unsuitable for navigation to avoid danger. The entire crew of the ship, such as sailors, stokers, and stewards, had already been given retirement pay by the company, which was collected and distributed by the Seamen's Union. However, the business department had not yet received this retirement pay. Therefore, yesterday, the business director, Yang Zesheng, led 16 people, including clerks, to petition General Manager Liu Hongsheng to issue the entire business department two and a half months of severance pay, totaling 1,635 yuan. Mr. Liu sent Jiang Jingrong, an employee of the general affairs department, to receive them. Jiang promised that General Manager Liu would submit it to the board of directors for discussion. After the meeting, Director Zhang replied that he would consider the matter further.</p>

<p>Yesterday, more than 20 representatives of merchants to whom the company owed outstanding debts submitted a document to the board of directors requesting a definite date for payment. Director Chen Shouyong received them and promised a formal reply regarding the payment date on the 20th of this month. The representatives were satisfied and left.</p>

<p>Four students from the navigation department of the China Merchants Public School also petitioned the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company yesterday, requesting the revocation of the decision to close the school. According to reports, the students of the first and second classes of the school had already graduated in order. According to the China Merchants Public School regulations, after graduation, students would receive ten rounds of practical driving courses. After two years, they would be officially promoted and employed and receive a stipend. Now, the graduates of our first and second classes have spent a long time and considerable money. Today, the company suddenly canceled their studies, which is extremely painful. Therefore, for the sake of their future, they requested that the board of directors revoke the decision and give the students the opportunity to navigate, etc. It is said that the board of directors is also considering the matter.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Yu Yan Discusses the Reorganization of Railway Operations (Continued) <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>丨Contributing Two Points for Future Direction丨</p>
<p>(II) Streamlining Passenger Transportation (A) Regarding the use of trains by personnel from various agencies, in the past, they could arbitrarily keep accounts, which was chaotic. I immediately worked with the chief accountant to draft six reorganization measures, which were submitted to the academy for approval and filed, and distributed to various railways for implementation to eliminate abuses. (B) Ordering measures for academic groups to travel by train. In the past, there was no fixed standard for preferential treatment for academic groups to travel by train, and there were many abuses. Nine measures have been revised, stipulating that they must be statutory academic groups and submitted by the Ministry of Education or the provincial and municipal governments to this Ministry for processing, and restrictions have been added to prevent abuses. (C) Reorganizing free tickets and the cleanliness and heating of passenger car equipment. Orders have been issued to strictly limit the daredevilry of free tickets on various railways. As for the precautions for passenger cars and the service of on-board staff, orders have been issued to various railways for compliance at any time. (III) Reorganizing Military Transportation. For matters such as military relief and public goods transportation, the railways were almost regarded as doing errands. This concept is fundamentally wrong. Railway transportation has original costs and is of a commercial nature. The prosperity or decline of business is of utmost importance to the future of the railways and the income of the country. Regarding military transportation, in the past, all accounts were kept.</p>
<p>This has been specially noted when implementing military transport regulations and handling them strictly. In the past six months, there have been no less than hundreds of cases where various parties arbitrarily requested transportation and were rationally rejected by this Ministry. Because the original military transport regulations were already very generous, it was inappropriate to accommodate them arbitrarily. (IV) Rectifying Disaster Relief Transportation. The loss of freight costs for various railways regarding disaster relief transportation reaches more than two million yuan each year. There have been rumors that the disaster relief transportation itself is not true or complete, so reorganization is inevitable. Since Yan took office, strict handling has been ordered. The free transportation of relief goods has been submitted to the academy for cancellation, and the flat-rate price reduction measures for rice and grain have also been stopped. (V) Restricting Public Transportation. The charging method for public special materials has been used for a long time, and many parties have exceeded the scope of requests for transportation, which is inevitably chaotic. An explanation has been added, and an order has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for filing, limiting it only to the central and local directly affiliated agencies and the articles needed for office use, which can be transported at half price in cash. Many parties have been rejected for their requests for transportation based on this. (VI) Developing Freight Transportation (A) The running time of freight cars on various railways is mostly uncertain, which goes against the spirit of scientific management. Orders have been issued to various railways to improve this immediately, open regular freight cars every day, and run mixed trains every day, and facilitate the transportation of fresh goods, and limit large packages to promote business. (B) The railway package business is closely related to the postal parcel business, and the number of postal parcels transported is of great importance to the package income of various railways. In 1921, the loss of freight costs for various railways transporting postal parcels reached more than 26 million. This postal parcel was originally a railway business itself. The post office used a special low freight rate, so the railway had no way to compete. The losses suffered have been calculated by statistical methods and submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for consideration of adding postal parcel freight costs, and efforts have been made to improve the package transportation of various railways to compete.

<p>The Effectiveness of Shell Aviation Gasoline</p>
<p>Those who care about the progress of aviation know that Britain has broken three world records for speed, height, and non-stop long-distance flight. The speed record was broken in September 1931 at Calshot at a rate of 407.5 miles per hour. The height record was broken in September 1932 at Bristol at a height of 43,976 feet. The non-stop long-distance flight record was broken from February 6 to 8 this year from Cranwell to South Africa, covering a total distance of 5,340 miles. When the world height record was broken, the pilot used Shell aviation lubricant oil, which contributed to the success. The non-stop long-distance flight was achieved with Shell aviation gasoline.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Red Pills Made Upstairs in a Restaurant <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Four Men and Women Arrested, Countless Red Pills Seized</p>
<p>Song Bingzheng and Chen Yaoting, Chinese detectives of the Public Concession Anti-Smoking Department, learned that the upstairs of Weishunxing Restaurant, a well-known pork rib restaurant at No. 313-314, opposite the Sanshan Guild Hall on Fuzhou Road, was a red pill manufacturing facility. Therefore, at 2:30 PM on the day before yesterday, they secretly went to search the place with West Detective Park Bobo and Detectives Ye Yusi and Xu Guirong. They arrested four people, including Yin Guoliang, Zhang Xiaodi, Huang Delin, and the woman Yin Wangshi, all from Wuxi. They seized numerous bags of red and white pills, countless red pill manufacturing raw materials, five manufacturing machines, and equipment such as printing and boxing tools, as well as more than 40 yuan in cash. The remaining money, estimated at six or seven thousand yuan, was also taken back to the Laozha Gate Police Station and detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the First Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu prosecuted them in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law, and said that the police had not yet chemically tested the drugs and raw materials seized due to time constraints, so they could not determine their names. He requested the court to postpone the hearing once after interrogation to facilitate chemical testing. Subsequently, Detective Chen submitted a report on the search process. Yin Guoliang had</p>
<p>mutually accused and shirked responsibility. Qian Hongye, the chief of the criminal court, reviewed the report and ordered all defendants to be remanded in custody for another hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Female Abductor Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Xiangsheng, owner of Shunxing Iron Shop at 276 North Sea Road, has a daughter named Guilin, who is 29 years old and still unmarried. Her aunt, Xu Jiangshi, harbored intentions of abduction and sale, and repeatedly enticed her with sweet words, saying that if she was willing to run away from her father, she would be chosen a satisfactory husband, with whom she could entrust her life, which would be better than guarding an empty room alone, shadows keeping each other company. The daughter, originally lovesick, agreed with her aunt and conspired. On December 27th, she took gold jewelry and fled with her aunt.  The aunt colluded with a woman named Zhu Zhangshi, who resided at 116 MikeGaoLuo Road in the French Concession, and abducted the daughter to Songjiang, selling her to Zhao A'quan's wife, obtaining 50 yuan in silver for the sale. Jiang, after losing his daughter, immediately posted rewards in newspapers seeking her whereabouts. It was not until the 6th of this month that a so-called "Songjiang boss" reported to Jiang.  He went to Songjiang to investigate, but Zhao A'quan had already fled. He only brought the daughter back. After questioning her about the details, he rushed to 77 Defen Lane to negotiate with his sister, Xu Jiangshi, and demand the return of the stolen gold jewelry. Xu Jiangshi, in accordance with the date set by her brother Jiang Xiangsheng, went to Zhu Zhangshi's home. While they were arguing, Xu Jiangshi also took the opportunity to escape. She was subsequently discovered by French police, who took everyone to the French Concession police station and transferred them to the Old Gate police station. Yesterday, they were sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Qian interrogated them and sentenced Zhu Zhangshi to two years of imprisonment.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Tax Bureau Inquires to Greyhound Racing Association <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Our government has never collected taxes from the greyhound racing track</p>
<p>The greyhound association claims to have paid stamp duty, to whom did it actually pay?</p>
<p>The greyhound association investigation opened for the third day yesterday</p>
<p>Xie Qijun, Director of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, because the Greyhound Racing Association case involves stamp duty, which is currently under the jurisdiction of the department, specially sent a letter to the association. The original text of the letter is as follows: To the Greyhound Racing Association,</p>
<p>It is noted that in the past two days, the British Consular Court has held a hearing on the case of your association suing Martin, the former Deputy Chief of the Public Works Department, and McNaughten, the former Chairman of the Board. Mr. White Ayes, during the court questioning, replied that your association had deducted 11 percent from the prize money of the dog ticket, of which 1 percent was used to pay the Chinese government stamp duty, and stated that this amount was paid secretly as a political event, etc. Now, under government orders, we solemnly request that you clarify to whom the aforementioned tax was actually paid, on what date it was paid, and the number of the check used to pay the money, item by item. Furthermore, the national government has never collected taxes from the greyhound racing track. If your association does not truthfully disclose the aforementioned details, the public will inevitably regard it as extortion. Then, your association and the recipient of the money will certainly bear the responsibility.</p>
<p>Therefore, we specially ask you to investigate and reply. With best wishes,</p>
<p>Xie Qi, February 9th, 22nd year.</p>
<p>The Greyhound Racing Association's lawsuit against Martin, the current acting Extra Chief of the Public Works Department, and McNaughten, the former Chairman of the Board, after the plaintiff's evidence was heard the day before yesterday, the defendant's lawyer, Hoberu, immediately requested the court to dismiss the case, saying that the plaintiff's statements were unfounded and that the defendant had no need to respond. When the trial opened for the third day yesterday morning, Hoberu made a statement on legal points, saying that the plaintiff alleged that the police prevented a member of the Greyhound Association from entering the garden on the night the Ming Garden was ordered to be closed, and that the member referred to was the plaintiff's lawyer, Harris, but the plaintiff has not yet proven that Harris is a member of the association. Now, the defendant has answered all the plaintiff's evidence one by one in the defense, so there is no need to order the defendant to testify in the witness box. Then, he read out Knachten's defense, saying that whether McNaughten was in a private capacity or as a director of the Public Works Department, there were no grounds for prosecution.</p>

<p>Wang Nengxiang sentenced to life imprisonment</p>
<p>Li Minghui's lover, Feng Deqian, and Zheng Guoyou, in March last year, became enemies in Hong Kong due to a love triangle. Zheng instigated Wang Nengxiang, a carpenter from Tongzhou in Hong Kong, and others to assassinate Feng on the way at night. Afterwards, Zheng was arrested by British officials in the area, interrogated, and found guilty, and sentenced to death. Now, his family is pleading with Hong Kong gentry to beg the British officials to spare Zheng's life, so the execution has been postponed. The murderer, Wang Nengxiang, fled to Shanghai after killing Feng, hiding in the Xiexu Road in Nanshi. He was later arrested by Lu Liankui, the chief detective of the Public Concession Police Department, and handed over to the First Special District Local Court. After obtaining the confession of the accomplice from the British Consular Court in Hong Kong, Li Minghui was summoned, and the court repeatedly held hearings and reached a conclusion. Yesterday morning, when the time for the sentencing arrived, Judge Qian Hongye ascended the seat in the First Criminal Court at 9:00 AM, ordered the defendant Wang Nengxiang to be brought to the court, and after questioning him, immediately announced the verdict: Wang Nengxiang was sentenced to life imprisonment for premeditated murder and deprived of public rights for life. After the verdict, the prisoner was taken by the police back to the police station for detention, awaiting execution after confirmation.</p>

<p>Chinese child in Anqing suddenly suffers from rabies</p>
<p>Life cannot be guaranteed if not treated in Shanghai within 24 hours</p>
<p>Western pilot flies to Beijing at risk in dense fog</p>
<p>The child arrived in Shanghai for medical treatment within 24 hours</p>
<p>On the morning of the day before yesterday, the plane of the China National Aviation Corporation from Hanzhong to the east was piloted by Western pilot Norris and Chinese pilot Pang. There were only two passengers in the plane, one was a child named Huisheng, who was only seven years old, and the other was an old woman, who was the child's grandmother. When the plane was less than a few miles away from Hanzhong, the weather suddenly deteriorated, and</p>
<h3 id="e166">The dense fog was extremely thick. <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, when the plane arrived at Anqing Airport, Hanzhong Company telegraphed the director of the airport, instructing him to stop the eastward flight to avoid danger. So the child and the old woman stayed at Anqing Airport. About one o'clock in the afternoon, the child suddenly fell ill, and his condition looked like rabies, trying to bite people around him. The grandmother immediately asked the doctor at the airport to diagnose him. The result of the diagnosis was that the child's illness required</p>
<h3 id="e167">Immediate injection in Shanghai. <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>If it exceeded 24 hours, it would be incurable. Then the old woman was very frightened. At that time, Western pilot Mr. Norris saw the situation and felt pity, and resolutely decided to fly the child and the woman to Nanjing, regardless of the difficulties, and decided to take the night train to Shanghai that night, so that they could arrive in Shanghai within 24 hours. After the plan was decided, he mustered his courage and set off,</p>
<h3 id="e168">Advancing in the dense fog. <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>When he arrived in Beijing at 3:00 PM, he immediately telegraphed Dr. Qiaodai, the director of the Seventh Bureau of Health in Shanghai, to report the matter and ask for a solution. And Mr. Norris himself, at 11:00 PM that night, personally accompanied the old woman and the child on the night express train from Beijing to Shanghai. He arrived in Shanghai at about 8:00 AM yesterday morning, and Dr. Qiaodai, the director of the Public Works Department Health Department, had already sent an ambulance to wait at the North Station. When Mr. Norris and others arrived at the station, they immediately took the car and sent the child and the old woman to the Western Isolation Hospital on Bazilu Road, where the hospital doctor gave them treatment. It is said that the situation is still good. Mr. Norris is truly worthy of being a person who sees righteousness and courage.</p>

<p>The Da Mei Evening News reported that yesterday (the 8th) a seven-year-old child, Wei Shan, was suspected of being bitten by a rabid dog. Accompanied by his grandmother and doctor Wang, he took a China National Aviation Corporation plane from Hankou to Shanghai for treatment. However, not long after departing from Hankou, he encountered a strong wind and rain. After flying over the wind and rain zone, he encountered dense fog, making the voyage extremely difficult. When he arrived in Anqing at noon, the pilot Norris received a telegram instructing him not to advance any further. Later, at 2:00 PM, the child's condition worsened, and the doctor claimed that only by rushing to Shanghai and injecting rabies serum within 24 hours could there be any hope of rescue. Norris, with a chivalrous heart, was not afraid of danger and obstacles, and then tried to set off at 3:00 PM, hoping to arrive in Beijing in the evening and catch the night train to Shanghai. The journey was extremely difficult. At times, he could only be a few feet away from the river surface, and even had to fly along the water surface. Finally, he was able to reach Nanjing as scheduled, and the child arrived safely in Shanghai this morning, and was notified in advance by Associated Press reporter Mr. Jin in Ning and telegraphed to Qiaodai of the Public Works Department Health Department in this area, who sent an ambulance to meet him at the station and immediately sent him to the Western Isolation Hospital for treatment. It has just been heard that the child's condition has greatly improved, but it is currently undetermined whether he is suffering from a rabid dog bite. The fact that Norris and Pang (transliteration), the pilots of the China National Aviation Corporation, disregarded the strange dangers of wind, rain, and fog, could stop but did not stop, and took saving the child's life as their goal, and were able to arrive in Shanghai on time and save his condition, their benevolent heart and chivalrous spirit is truly commendable.</p>

<h3 id="e175">The True Calligraphy of Song Wenxin, Duke of the State of Xin, Embodies the Great National Character of China <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Exhibited publicly at the Ningbo Native Place Association on the 12th. A calligraphy piece personally written by Song Wenxin, Duke of the State of Xin, in the sixth year of Xianchun, featuring the sayings of Monk Hui, is several feet long. The calligraphy is well-preserved and contains inscriptions by famous figures throughout history, including Yuan Wang Meng, Ming Wen Zhengming, Wen Zhenshen, Qing Ye Shaoben, and Li Yanzhang. During the Daoguang era of the previous Qing dynasty, a certain traveling official encountered the Hui-Han War in Yunnan, which lasted for eighteen years. Somehow, the calligraphy piece ended up in the collection of Imperial Censor Luo Pingbao in Yunnan Province. Now, his descendant, Mr. Dou Shao Huai, who harbored ambitions since childhood and studied military affairs, during the September 18th Incident and the Songhu Battle, Mr. Dou delivered speeches in Yunnan, constantly encouraging the public to preserve the national territory and support the Northeast by aiding the volunteer army. He was recommended by the Yunnan Provincial Anti-Japanese Support Association to represent and comfort the volunteer army in the Northeast. Upon returning home and packing, he unintentionally discovered a calligraphy piece of Song Wenxin, Duke of the State of Xin, from the old collection of Imperial Censor Dou. He earnestly requested Mr. Chen Xiaopu of Kunming, the former Shandong Chief Education Officer (i.e., Chen 　Sou), to examine and verify it. Mr. Chen recognized it as a rare treasure, of great relevance to China's history and culture. He added an inscription to record the event. While leaving Yunnan and passing through Hong Kong, Mr. Hu Zhantang, the former President of the Legislative Yuan, appraised it and deemed it a valuable item. After arriving in Shanghai, he entrusted friends to seek detailed appraisal from famous figures in Beijing and Shanghai, including Xie Huisheng, Yang Cangbai, Sun Bolan, Chu Huiseng, Shi Liangcai, Li Dahao, and Shanren Shi Linghan. All considered it a national treasure, not suitable for individual preservation, and suggested it should be made public or preserved by the state, to inspire the spirit of the nation and save the precarious Republic of China. Mr. Dou deeply agreed. Starting from 1 PM to 5 PM on the 12th of this month, it will be exhibited for several days at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Xizang Road, participating in a calligraphy and painting exhibition. The tentatively set price is ten thousand yuan, with five thousand yuan earmarked for expenses for working in the Northeast. Regardless of the amount sold, the remaining proceeds will be donated to the volunteer army. Anyone who admires the great national character of Duke of the State of Xin and supports resisting Japan to save the country, please come and view it quickly.</p>
<p>The stream of visitors never ceased, and the threshold was worn through. It was truly the grandest scene since the establishment of the National Goods Company in Shanghai. Guests included Wang Xiaolai, Qin Runqing, Pan Gongzhan, Xu Peihuang, Bei Songsun, Wen Lanting, Qian Chengxu, Chen Pingcheng, Fang Jiyang, Pan Xulun, Guo Shun, Kuang Zhongmou, Xu Xinliu, Chu Huiseng, Chen Songyuan, Shi Jiu'ao, Zhang 　Bo, Fang Jiaobo, Jin Lüqin, Zou Bingwen, Jing Runshi, Shen Tianxin, Feng Shaoshan, Zhao Shuyong, Yu Zuoting, Lao Jingxiu, and over a thousand others.

<p>Zhang Hongdou Sentenced to Two Months, Suspended</p>
<p>The Chief Detective of the Old Zhabei Police Station recently received confidential information that a human trafficking organization was operating at No. 70 Xiangfen Lane, and that it was also harboring assassination suspects. Therefore, the detective, along with Detectives Liu Junqing and Zhou Guisen, rushed to the location for a raid the day before yesterday afternoon. Upon arrival, they found the double doors tightly closed. After knocking for a long time, a woman named Lin Wangshi opened the door. Detective You and others immediately detained the woman and an eleven-year-old girl named Zhang Aidi. Upon searching the house, Lin Wangshi's paramour, Lin Wenming, who was hiding under the bed, was also found and brought back to the police station. After questioning, it was learned that Aidi lived at No. 165 Zhengjia Wood Bridge in the French Concession with an elderly woman named Zhang Chenshi, who was nearly seventy years old. Zhang Chenshi had bought Aidi as an adopted daughter when she was six years old. Recently, Zhang Hongbao, a prostitute from the Heyi Lane No. 6 brothel on Guangxi Road, lured Aidi out and forced her into prostitution. Although Aidi was not yet an adult, she had been sexually involved with several men. Since Zhang Hongbao had deceived her and Aidi dared not return home, Zhang Hongbao housed her at Lin's residence. The detectives also learned that Lin Wenming, in December of last year, along with his accomplice Lu Xuedao, had abducted a young woman named Zhang Adou, who was just over a year old, at the Xian Shi Amusement Park and took her to a hotel for sexual relations. Later, Lu took her to a brothel in Tianjin, where she was sold for eighty yuan, which was then split between them. However, Lu is now missing and cannot be traced. Only Zhang Hongbao was arrested. Yesterday morning, along with the Lin Wenming couple, they were sent to the First Special District Local Court, and Aidi was summoned to testify. Judge Qian Hongye conducted the trial. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu explained the case and questioned Zhang Aidi, who stated that she had voluntarily received guests and was not forced. The Lin couple stated that Aidi was brought to their residence by Hongbao. Hongbao admitted to housing Aidi at Lin's residence. After the trial, Judge Qian sentenced Zhang Hongbao to two months in prison, suspended for two years due to being a first-time offender. Lin Wenming and Lin Wangshi were found not guilty in the Aidi case. As for the case of abducting Zhang Abao, it did not comply with the procedures and should not be accepted. Zhang Aidi was taken home by her family.</p>

<h3 id="e178">How Can We Complete Our Love? <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Zhou丨</p>
<p>I have a difficult problem, please give me a clear instruction. I think you are very busy, so I’ll make it short: I am a high school student about to graduate. Although my family is not wealthy, my father and brothers are still earning a living, so we can manage. I am already twenty years old. My parents always tell me to resolve the issue of marriage early. In the past, they introduced me to many families, some with daughters from wealthy or powerful families. But I always felt that this kind of transactional system was not something I wanted to do. Therefore, my parents told me to handle this matter myself. But in this world obsessed with money, how can a poor scholar like me be qualified to talk about love? So, this matter has been put off until last year, and I always answered them with "Let's wait." But last summer vacation, a woman who I used to be in love with reignited our romance. In the past, people said she was a romantic, depraved, and extremely bad woman. Friends advised me not to get close to her again. My parents scolded me, saying that I shouldn't be so self-destructive. But I don't think she's that kind of person. Her past life was indeed very depraved, but it wasn't her fault. It was entirely because she was too young and was deceived by others. They shouldn't blame her. We should forgive her! No, we should sympathize with her. Now that she has realized her mistakes, how can we not help her? So, I made a big decision and immediately accepted her love. At the same time, she is very grateful to me, so our love has reached its highest intensity. However, our difficulties have also come with it. It turns out that her parents do not agree with our love. I realized this recently from their attitude towards her. Because in recent months, their surveillance of her has been very strict. All the letters I give her have to go through their strict inspection, and some are not even delivered to her (this has never happened before). This has made our feelings very distant. At the same time, I heard that my family, seeing that we have a close relationship, also wants to facilitate this good thing. They once asked someone to speak to her family. Although my father and her father have been friends for many years, they were turned away. So, this matter has been put off. From these two points, it is clear that her parents do not approve of our relationship. So, what should we do? Should we elope? But there is no way to get her out of her family because she is being watched. Should I ask my friends and relatives to plead again? The past facts have already told us the answer. What's the point of running into a wall again? Then, should I give her up? I would never do such a thing that goes against my conscience! But what should I do? There is another layer, can</p>
<p>Mr. have a way to get her out of her family's restraints? But how should we proceed with our future? What about the question? The question of living? Because my family has recently had discord between my brother and sister-in-law, and it will definitely break down soon. After the breakdown, wouldn't even my personal life be affected? How would I have the ability to support her then? Regarding this point,</p>
<p>Mr. might say: "If there is really no way, you can find work!" Yes! This is indeed a wonderful way out. But in this society where there are more people than jobs, how can it be so easy to find work? Moreover, we have no specialized skills. I am just a high school student, and she is just a graduate of a sericulture school. With the silk industry already bankrupt in China, there are no jobs for her. We have no powerful people, so how can we find our rice bowls? Of course, if we take off our robes and go underground to live like cattle and horses, there will be no shortage of work. But our bodies, which have long been spoiled by a life of leisure, how can we do that? So, these things definitely need to be considered before we proceed with this matter, don't you think? I have always admired the</p>
<p>Brilliant sir! You will surely be able to give me a perfect answer to these difficult questions. I am eagerly waiting!</p>
<p>Reply: After reading your letter, we have a lot of emotion. This emotion is not about the oppression of the old society, but rather that we Chinese youth lack the ability to be independent. Like you, before the love issue arose, you relied on your parents for a "life of leisure" and didn't feel anything lacking. But now, for the sake of love, you want to live independently, and you immediately feel all sorts of difficulties. This is a complete exposure of the weakness of youth's dependence! Although this is not the main point you asked us to answer, it is worth mentioning specifically and discussing with you. Then we will talk about the love issue: You can forgive her for being deceived by others, sympathize with her awakening, and decide to accept her love, breaking all prejudices. This kind of understanding is worthy of our approval. But I don’t know if the other party's awakening is real, and whether your observation of her is genuine, and whether there is anything concealed by emotions? You still need to consider this carefully. If your observation of her is indeed genuine, then this love is very easy to complete. According to what is said in the letter, your parents have agreed to this marriage, while the other parents are against it. This is quite strange; Since the other party has stumbled, it stands to reason that your parents should be the ones opposing this marriage. The other parents probably have something they don't want, but now it's the opposite, which is really a bit contrary to common sense. I don’t know what the other parents are against? That is, what is the reason for their opposition to this marriage? In this regard, you should go back and study it. Whatever the result of the study, whether it is reasonable or unreasonable, in this reasonable or unreasonable, you can always find a solution. This method is to kindly explain the misunderstanding of the other party's parents. If the other party's parents are stubborn to the end, then if you both ask yourself if you have the courage to fight society, at least have the ability to live independently, you may wish to leave the family and form a small family. According to the law, men and women who are of age (full 20 years old) can freely engage and marry, and no one may interfere. You don't have to be afraid of people oppressing you on this point. (However, you should pay attention to whether the other party has reached adulthood) The problem of life after leaving the family should naturally be thought of by yourself. If you are afraid of not finding a job temporarily, you can go to look for it before you actually live together. Wait until you find a definite occupation and there is no problem with life, then you can do it according to your purpose. You said that your body has been spoiled by a life of leisure, but that is just an excuse. Even if your body is not very strong, you will always be unable to do things. Even if you can't do hard work, ordinary and not very laborious things will not torture you. If you are fundamentally afraid of doing things and just want to rely on others to live, then you are simply not worthy of being a modern youth, and you are simply not worthy of talking about love, so you should listen to others! If you have the courage to fight society, then this basic independent life should have a way to make it happen. There are even greater difficulties in society waiting for you to open up. If you are timid and afraid of things everywhere, and defend yourself with the name "spoiled", you may not have hope for a lifetime. A strong physique and a brave spirit should be honed in hardship and difficulty. If you are afraid of honing, how can light come? Here, you should have some deep understanding! Here, the reporter believes that the important issue at present does not seem to be in the question of "how to complete", but in the question of "whether to complete", in other words: It is easy for you to succeed in love, but whether the other party is really lovely? Does she really love you? Will the future ending be satisfactory? You still need to do some research on these issues. Don't indulge in temporary emotions, and it will end up being a waste.

<h3 id="e188">City Education Bureau Director Pan Gongzhan's Speech [Shanghai's Education] (2) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Overview of School Education and Social Education</p>
<p>Now, I will briefly report on the current situation of various levels as follows:</p>
<p>I. Kindergarten School education's first stage is kindergarten. Cultivating children is important. There are very few independently established kindergartens in the city. Most are attached to primary schools. Only the Municipal First Kindergarten is an independent kindergarten, founded in 1929. There are a total of twelve municipal kindergartens attached to primary schools. In addition, there are five private Li'an kindergartens, plus twenty private, unregistered ones, and the Shanghai Middle School Kindergarten of the Provincial Level, totaling twenty-nine kindergartens in the city. According to the 1931 statistics, these kindergartens had a total of 1,856 children and 110 teachers.</p>
<p>Most kindergartens in the city have one director who leads several teachers and nannies to share all teaching and management affairs. If the number of students is less than 50, they are organized into one classroom. If there are about 100 students, they are divided into two classrooms. The facilities in the kindergarten include various models and forms, instruments, pianos, toys, etc., required for games, music, work, knowledge, and decoration. Their curriculum is roughly divided into three parts: singing and playing, sports, and work. According to the children's needs, the project method is used to arouse the children's motivation, and then they are guided according to the situation, so that the children's physical and mental development can be properly developed.</p>
<p>Primary schools: The city has a dense population, and the number of school-age children should of course be extremely large. How many are there? According to the statistics of the second semester of 1931 (i.e., summer of 1932), there were only 624 schools, distributed as follows:</p>
<p>(1) National: 1, (2) Ministerial: 2, (3) Provincial: 1, (4) Municipal: 186, (5) Public Concession's Municipal Council: 8, (6) French Concession's Municipal Council: 1, (7) Other public: 3, (8) Private registered: 146, (9) Private unregistered: 276, Total: 624.</p>
<p>In terms of funding, according to the 1931-1932 statistics, the total funding for municipal primary schools in the city was 527,797 yuan, while the total funding for public and private primary schools in the city was 2,248,136 yuan. Compared with the 2,145,211 yuan in 1929-1930, it has increased by 102,925 yuan. In the winter of 1931, the total number of primary school children in the city was: (1) Boys: 80,111, (2) Girls: 33,493, totaling 113,604. The number of female students is almost half of the number of male students, which shows that women's education has also made much progress compared to the past. Speaking of the distribution of ages, the oldest student in the primary level is about 19 years old, and the youngest is 4 years old, while the oldest student in the complete primary school is 20 years old, and the youngest is 8 years old. According to the statistics of the first semester of 1931-1932, the total number of teachers was 4,787. On average, each teacher teaches 24 students. This ratio seems too small compared to Western countries. It can be seen that school facilities and teacher efficiency should be increased as much as possible, and it is hoped that at least 50 to 60 students can be assigned to one teacher.</p>
<p>As for the school's grade organization, most primary schools in the urban area have a large number of children entering the school, and more than 80% are single-grade organizations. There are also complex-grade organizations. More than 80% of rural primary schools are single-grade organizations, with a small number using complex-grade organizations, while single-grade organizations are rare. As for teaching methods, most middle and high grades use Japanese-style tutoring, and lower grades use project-based learning. In class teaching, attention is also paid to individual differences. In addition, the First Experimental Primary School was specially established. The Dalton system was tested the year before last, and life-based integrated education is being implemented this year.</p>
<p>Speaking of the situation of primary school graduates, it is also interesting. According to the statistics of 1930-1931, there were a total of 1,231 graduates from municipal primary schools in the city, of which 62.71% went on to higher education, 23.08% were employed, 18.61% were unemployed, and 5.60% were in other categories.</p>
<p>In addition, the primary school curriculum is all in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Education. As for facilities, schools in the urban area are more complete than schools in the rural area. Almost all primary schools in the urban area have classrooms, workshops, meeting rooms, gymnasiums, school gardens, cooperatives, reading rooms, and fire and health facilities. Most schools have already installed them. Rural primary schools and private primary schools have slightly worse facilities than municipal schools in the urban area.</p>
<p>II. Secondary schools: Since there are more than 600 primary schools in the city, the demand for secondary schools is also extremely urgent. Although secondary schools in the city cannot be said to be developed, they are much more advanced than before. Now, the general situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Total number of secondary schools in the city: Secondary schools in the city are divided into two types: (1) Junior secondary schools: national 1, municipal 2, private registered 11, private unregistered 24, total 38. (2) Complete secondary schools (two levels): national 1, provincial 1, municipal 2, Municipal Council of the Public Concession 5, Municipal Council of the Public Concession 1, private registered 38, private unregistered 25, total 74.</p>
<p>(B) The total expenditure of secondary schools in the city is shown in the following table:</p>

<p>Total 15,013 4,630 15,910 5,940</p>
<p>The grade organization of secondary schools in the city mostly follows the new school system promulgated by the Ministry of Education in the 11th year of the Republic of China, dividing it into three years of junior high school and three years of senior high school. Municipal secondary schools, except for Yangjing Middle School, which is temporarily using part of the school buildings of Zhenxiu Primary School, are about to be rebuilt. The school buildings and equipment of the other four schools, such as Wuben, Jingdui, Wusong, and Xinlu, are still usable. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e190">News from Various Schools <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>Shenmei Girls' High School After Shenmei Girls' High School moved to its new address on Maigen Road, the school buildings are spacious and the scale is grand. The internal organization strives for perfection. This semester, many specialized teachers in various subjects have been newly hired. They are all well-known people in the country and are currently engaged in inviting experts in various subjects in the country to give lectures in rotation every week to increase students' interest. Classes officially start on the 6th.</p>
<p>Bai'e Painting Tutoring School The Bai'e Painting Tutoring School affiliated to the Bai'e Painting Association, which is filed with the Ministry of Education and registered with the Shanghai Education Bureau, is the only painting tutoring school in Shanghai. Since moving to the Western-style house at No. 714, the intersection of Aiven Road and Kader Road, it has opened winter tutoring classes, and many people have joined. It is now known that the school's spring semester will officially start on January 15th, and registration will begin one week in advance. Recently, the number of applicants has been very enthusiastic. However, due to the limited school buildings, the school has decided to only accept 60 students each. No more will be accepted when the quota is full, regardless of gender. Anyone who is interested in studying art, whether they have studied it or not, can quickly register to join. In addition, the school recently added a practical fine arts crash course from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 a.m. due to the lack of practical art talents in the current society and the requirements of various scholars. Whether you have a painting foundation or not, you can complete it within half a year, and use practical skills for production to meet the needs of the society. The class is personally taught by the famous painter Xue Hu, and the teaching is meticulous and detailed. The subjects are divided into four types: sketching (cartoons, satire books, advertising paintings, and decorative paintings, etc.), patterns (color, monochrome, crafts, and decorative patterns, etc.), painting (book cover paintings, advertisements, and various decorative paintings), and art writing (various writing methods in Chinese and Western languages). It is the only good opportunity for those who are limited by economic time but are uneasy about applied art. Exquisite details are available, and a four-point stamp is required for information.</p>
<p>Yangxing Primary School The private Yangxing Primary School on Datong Road, Zhabei, has been approved by the Municipal Education Bureau to conduct a trial run. The number of students in the current semester has increased sharply by nearly a hundred. Yesterday, the school held an opening ceremony.

<p>Although there were no special circumstances in the last Group A match between Xiqing and Youth, the situation was quite tense. The Youth team's spirit was commendable, and their efforts and achievements were remarkable. They had a very good chance of winning, but they lost due to the expulsion of defender Tao Zunan. However, the final score difference was only five points. Youth lost, but with this result, they can be proud. At the beginning of the contact, the Youth team's ball momentum was smooth, and they once took a 5-1 lead, then 7-4. Xiqing rested and devised another strategy. Qi Ershimis successively scored, and the Youth team fell behind 7-8 by one point. Center Cheng Jingxing then created a 9-8 advantage. From then on, Xiqing's momentum was overwhelming, taking the lead. The Youth team did not show weakness and chased after them. Although they could not catch up, the score difference was not much. At the end of the first half, Xiqing had 20 points, and Youth had 15 points. As the war began again, the Youth team's Cheng Jingxing added three points, making it 18-20, only two points behind. Xiqing took advantage of the victory and became more and more energetic. Qi Er increased by five points alone, and Bai Nait repeatedly scored three goals. The Youth team was chased by Wu Youliang and Cheng Yingxing, with a score of 26 to 16. At that time, the situation was tense, and the Youth team had a very good chance of surpassing. Unexpectedly, defender Tao Zunan had four violations and was expelled, allowing Xiqing to score several more goals, making it 29-26. The Youth team was devastated by this heavy blow and became frustrated, but they continued to work hard without discouragement. Wu Youliang performed well, Cheng Jingxing worked hard, and Zhou Xuejin had remaining courage, winning a lot of applause. After working hard, they still lost by five points. Xiqing won 39 to 24.</p>

<p>The gold price continues to rise, with thin spot inventory. The central bank frequently absorbs spot gold. Speculators lack resistance and adopt a hedging policy. The swap market is dominated by long positions, with the power to drive up prices.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Moving Forward Calmly, Up 3.4 Taels <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, according to reports, near and deferred contracts rebounded by 125. Exchange rates did not fluctuate much. New York silver prices also rose sharply by .25. Deferred silver prices rose by more than 1%. American cotton also did not fluctuate much. Although bank private cables were large, they were not numerous. In addition, the market sentiment remained firm. The opening price was 795.3 taels. Although it fell, it did not fall excessively, reaching 794.5 taels, and then continued to rise. Although the foreign exchange market opened slightly firm, it then became sharp, and the gold price gradually rose. HSBC's listing remained unchanged. Sanjing even bought May and June US dollars at 28.375 yuan, breaking through the 800 tael mark and reaching 800.008 taels. Afterwards, it remained flat and retreated within 800 taels. The foreign exchange market opened at 68.75 for this month's British pound and 28.125 for the US dollar, and closed at 797.9 taels. In the afternoon, buying interest spread, and Qian Changxiang and others repeatedly purchased aggressively, believing that they were acting on behalf of the central bank. Bills of exchange also tightened accordingly. The March US dollar traded at 28.125 yuan, once rising to 802.5 taels. Mumbai rose and then fell back. The final closing price was 800.05 taels. Although the gold market opened low, it closed high. Although the trend was good, it did not break out of the range, mainly because the swap was approaching. The general psychology is that long positions are extremely dominant in this swap. Short positions are weak and lack resistance. Spot inventory is lacking, and the central bank frequently absorbs spot gold, all of which gives the long positions the power to drive up prices. Small-time speculators, seeing the situation unfavorable, rushed to cover their positions. Large players pulled up the market with considerable force, and the foreign exchange market tightened further. Qian Changxiang aggressively bought futures in the afternoon, and the market rumored that it was on behalf of the central bank. Short sellers believed that this swap would cause even more panic, but this has not been confirmed. However, the central bank is a financial institution, not a speculator, and does not make profits or losses itself, and may not intentionally drive up prices. The swap (February to March) premium continued to rise, reaching 3 taels, and it was not easy to swap. The market was slightly more active in the afternoon. Hengxing once opened 140 spot contracts on behalf of the central bank, priced at 801.5 taels. Today, the day's situation will be recorded in detail below.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Initial Decline, Gradual Rise Afterwards <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The morning opening price was 795.3 taels, down 1.8 taels from the previous close, which was not excessive, mainly because market sentiment remained stable. The opening price of spot goods was lower, at 794.5 taels, so general arbitrageurs came to sell contracts, falling to 4.5 taels. The foreign exchange market opened the same as the gold price. Although it was firmer than the previous close, it was not much. The near-term British pound was quoted at 1 shilling 7.75 pence, and the US dollar at 28.35 yuan. Dadecheng first bought contracts, and then rebounded. Banks had good appetite. Although HSBC offered the March US dollar at 3.125, Zhejiang was willing to buy, and Zhifeng Yonglai bought at 6 taels, slightly rising and fluctuating, falling back a few cents, but still showing improvement. Zhifeng Yongshun competed to buy, reaching 6.7 cents. Holland bought this month's US dollar at 1.875, which was tighter than the opening. Yuanheng Dadecheng bought to 7.5 taels, and Hengyu Qian Changxiang Yuanheng bought to 8 taels. This month's US dollar at 1.875 could not be settled and reached 8.5 taels. Afterwards, it gradually hovered, fluctuating for a long time around 8 taels. HSBC's listed British and US exchange rates did not change. Qian Changxiang bought contracts, and Mitsui also bought the May US dollar at 3.75, so the Dalian gang sold off, and Zhaofeng Chang also bought at this time. The gold price then broke through the 800 tael mark. Mitsui even bought the June US dollar at 3.75. Hengyu Zhifeng Yonglai came up to add positions, and the price reached 800.008 taels. The foreign exchange market stopped here. Banks then tended to spit out positions, and Zhaofeng Chang Wanxing sold off at around 800 taels, then hovered and entered the 800 tael mark again. The May US dollar at 3.75, no one wanted to take it, and Zhifeng Yonglai sold off, to 8 taels. Dadecheng and others came to buy, and it slightly rebounded. Before long, Yuan Mao Yonglai sold, and retail investors rushed to sell contracts, once retreating to 7 taels. But because the foreign exchange market remained flat, the market saw a rise. Hongli bought to around 8 taels, and trading was less, fluctuating between 8 taels and 8.5 taels. There were no transactions in the foreign exchange market. This month's British pound at 68.75 and the US dollar at 1.25 could be settled. Fuyu slightly offered at 7.7 cents. Afterwards, Dadecheng and Qian Changxiang were buyers, and Yuanheng was the seller. The gold price was supported around 8 taels, and the market was about to close. Trading was not active, and the price was stable. The final closing price was 797.9 taels, and spot goods were slightly higher, selling at 8 taels and 2 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Peak of 802.5 Taels in the Afternoon <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>The afternoon opening price was 798.1 taels. At first, it was extremely quiet, fluctuating only a few cents. Then, Qian Changxiang Fuyu successively bought contracts, and the price soared from 7.5 taels, breaking through 800 taels to 003 taels. But the change was extremely rapid, and in an instant, it retreated by 1 tael, to 99.2 taels. Citibank bought the lower half of this month's US dollar at 28.125 yuan. Qian Changxiang Hengyu Zhifeng Yong Zhaofeng Chang Fuyu continued to compete to buy, and the May US dollar at 3.75 could not be settled, and the price rose to 801.3 taels. Ruixing came to sell off, and Hengxing also came to limit the sale, falling back slightly, to 800 taels. But Qian Changxiang aggressively bought several times, and the market believed that it was the central bank buying futures on their behalf. This swap was not favorable for short sellers, and they rushed to buy contracts. Large players such as Zhaofeng Chang Hengyu all bought, jumping up 2 taels, to 2.1 taels. Afterwards, Bingxing aggressively covered their short positions. Although the price was not high, it was supported around 1.5 taels for a long time. When Yuanheng came to sell, it fell to 1 tael. Meifeng bought the March US dollar at 1.25. Fushun Zhifeng Yong Dadecheng all bought, reaching 802.5 taels and stopping. Then, it began to fluctuate, and then Mumbai telegraphed to not move, and the price rose by 3 annas, and the price went downstream, retreating to 008 taels, because Hongli Fuyu slightly sold contracts. Huabi also bought the March US dollar at 1.25, Hengyu first bought, and Qian Changxiang continued to buy to 2 taels, and Zhifeng Yong also bought, and it saw 2.5 taels again. Shengda came to sell off, returning to within 2 taels. Afterwards, trading was less, but the trend was downstream, going lower and lower, to around 1 tael. Hengxing opened spot goods on behalf of China Finance. Citibank sold the March US dollar at 1.25. Yongfeng slightly sold off, and the price dropped to 004 taels. At this time, retail investors all sold, and spot goods slightly pulled in, rising to 006 taels. The closing price was 800 taels and 005 taels, and spot goods sold for 3 cents higher, at 800 taels and 007 taels. The highest price of the day was 802.5 taels, and the lowest price was 794.5 taels, with a difference of 8 taels. The result was a further increase of 3.4 taels compared to the previous close.</p>
<h3 id="e207">Listed Price Less Reduced by 3 Taels and Strong <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>The listed price was reduced because HSBC's listed British and US exchange rates did not change. The US exchange rate was still calculated at 28 yuan, and the combined gold price was 857.114 taels, which was about 56 taels more than the closing price, about 3 taels less than the previous close. The registration price for this month was 799 taels, and the registration price for March was 798 taels. The water replenishment price in the morning was 800 taels, and in the afternoon it was 803 taels.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Qian Changxiang's Purchases Were the Largest <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>On the trading floor, the balance was balanced in the morning, and demand exceeded supply in the afternoon. Statistics show that Zhifeng Yong, Qian Changxiang, Zhaofeng Chang, Hengyu, Bingxing, Dadecheng, Fuyu, Hengxing, etc. were all buyers, among which Qian Changxiang's purchases were the largest, with about 1,000 contracts bought before and after the market. Bingxing only covered their short positions in the afternoon, with about 400 contracts. The sellers included Yuan, Ruixing, Yuan Mao Yong, Yuan Chun Shunli Tianfeng Yong Wanxing, etc. Spot arbitrageurs were in short positions. There was still little trading in the Dalian gang, and the Guang gang rarely squeezed in.</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Crackling Was Extremely Quiet, With Colleagues Going Through the Motions <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The crackling market was still silent yesterday, without any movement. It was delayed for a long time, and in the end, colleagues did it against each other, just to go through the motions. It was calculated at 12 taels, but in reality, even if it was done at 13 taels, it was unlikely that there would be a transaction.</p>
<h3 id="e210">The Swap Premium Reached as High as 3 Taels <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>The swap face was stuck. There were no transactions in the morning. Short sellers once shouted a premium of 3 taels to 3.5 taels, but the spot contract numbers remained silent. There seemed to be a slight activity in the afternoon. Spot contract numbers Tongfengheng once swapped 203 contracts to Hengxing, with Hengxing offering a premium of 3 taels, indicating that the spot contract turnover was more flexible today.</p>
<h3 id="e211">The Foreign Exchange Tightened After Loosening <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>

<p>Copper Coins Suddenly Retreated</p>
<p>Yesterday, the silver and dollar market was flat, and the situation was no different from the past. However, its receiving and settling scene seemed slightly more active than before the Lantern Festival. Observing its general trend, business was quite prosperous. The situation yesterday will be distributed as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e214">Foreign Exchange Slackens <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>[Foreign Exchange Premium] In the morning, banks still had a slight appetite for buying, but only the central bank was more enthusiastic, and the rest were generally slack, so the premium rate dropped slightly by 2.5 hairs, to 7 qian 1 fen 4.5 hairs. The afternoon market had no opportunity for a meeting as usual, and trading will not begin until today. [Silver Loans] Because the needs of all sectors are still weak and there are few uses, there seems to be no possibility of tight silver funds. In the end, it was still the same as before, all borrowed for free. The small general meeting also opened a free draw for the first lot.</p>

<p>On the money shop side, every year before the Lantern Festival, for five or six days, visiting cards are sent out to customers. As a rule, only real customers and employees with connections are likely to be approved. Now, due to changes in current affairs, the opposite is true. Money shops, in order to be cautious in their operations and avoid danger, are reluctant to send out cards indiscriminately. In the end, there are quite a few who open the cards but dare not send them out. As for those who have already sent them out, they have only reached about one-third. This is a general overview of the opening and sending of cards in the past five or six days. As for the bank side, in recent years, they have not only been engaged in banking business as before. Now, they are also engaged in money shop-like lending business and are also asking employees to solicit business in various ways. Although banks such as the Bank of Communications and the Bank of Communications do not do this at their headquarters, all branches have this major plan for operation. Therefore, most of the important business of money shops has now been robbed by banks.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the public debt market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was slightly more active, and trading also increased slightly. However, market prices still rose and fell erratically, and the range of fluctuation became narrower and narrower. Market sentiment was still due to the lack of progress in the diplomatic situation. Supply and demand were quite balanced. Trading was more energetic in the two morning sessions. In the first session, retail investors bought quite a bit, and Nos. 11 and 32 were also bought a bit. Market prices increased by 34 cents. In the second session, long positions were swapped, and there were several signs of low near-term and high deferred positions. Trading was lighter in the afternoon, and market prices fluctuated without certainty, generally fluctuating between 12 cents. Major players did not come on the market to buy or sell. The market price results were mixed, with some rising and some falling. Among them, reorganization bonds fell slightly by 2 cents, salt tax bonds fell slightly by 1 cent and 5 hairs, and the rest rose slightly by 23 cents. The total number of transactions was 5,079,000 yuan, of which 4,000 yuan was in spot goods, and salt tax futures accounted for more than 3.5 million yuan. The rest ranged from 230,000 to 500,000 yuan. Only 18 customs bonds and Jin Chang 96 bonds each traded for 5,000 yuan.</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Wednesday (8th), the New York stock market rose because short positions feared that AT&amp;T would continue to pay dividends, so they covered their positions. At the same time, the January report of General Motors was good, and market sentiment was quite good. According to the Steel Century magazine, the steel workload this week is about 19%, but there will also be a large demand from the railway industry in early March, and the trend is more promising. The total turnover for the day was 720,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<p>Indian Cotton Opens at 2,000 Pieces, Price Drops Another 7.5 Cents</p>
<p>The yarn market is becoming weak, and the wind of decline is gradually intensifying. Because it has been brewing and fluctuating for a long time, customer sales are still stagnant, and market sentiment is weak, and scattered long positions are showing anxiety. In addition, the cotton market is unstable, and the yarn market, which is closely related, is even more difficult to stabilize. As for the real demand, because the commercial situation in the interior is depressed, it is difficult to improve for a while. In addition, the smoke of war is thick in North China. It can still be maintained for the time being. If spot yarn is suspended for a long time, there will be a drastic change.</p>

<p>The Human Mark market opened in the morning, with American cotton stable and Indian cotton very weak, which softened market sentiment, and selling pressure was stronger. Prices for each month fell 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8 cents. In the afternoon, there were reports of cheap Indian cotton being made to order, and the market situation was even weaker. Prices for each month fell another 4, 5, 6, and 7 cents. The total transaction for the day was 19,800 bales. It was found that Chunji sold 1,550 bales, Tongfu 800 bales, Gengfeng 550 bales, Changyu 500 bales, Senkang 500 bales, Rongxing 450 bales, Renfeng 400 bales, Yiyu 500 bales, and Xiesheng 550 bales.

<p>The off-take of spot yarn is still slow. It was found that all gangs bought a total of 431 bales for the day. Prices fell by 2.5 cents to 5 cents. 32-count and 42-count yarns fell by 5 cents to 1 tael. The buying amount of each gang is as follows.</p>

<p>The flower market is falling sharply, and the situation is very panicked. Because the Indian cotton market is falling, new lows are gradually appearing, so each foreign firm is vigorously selling in the market, and prices are very willing to compromise, seeking a way out. Today's market price is 7.5 cents cheaper than the previous day, and 230 pieces are opened. As a result, market sentiment suddenly became alarmed, but some people are still absorbing and going long. However, judging from the world trend, there is still a drastic change to be realized in the future.</p>

<p>The Zheng Mark market opened in the morning, with Indian cotton falling again, and market sentiment was even weaker. New sellers were also seen to increase, and prices for each month fell by 1.5 cents to 2 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that 2,000 pieces of Indian cotton were being made to order, and the market situation suddenly declined, and the wind of decline became more intense, falling by 1 cent to 1.5 cents, and the deferred contracts fell by 3.5 cents. Only the Gengfeng absorbed 3,000 dan in the current month, so the market situation brought about a rise, but the deferred contracts were weak. The total transaction for the day was 62,100 dan.

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was calm. At closing, it was weak due to profit-taking by bulls and selling from the South. Futures prices fluctuated by one pound. Spot prices remained unchanged. English cotton futures rose 7-8 points, and spot prices rose 5 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose 7 points. Indian cotton initially rose along with American cotton, but later weakened due to selling by Japanese merchants. Pingguoer fell by one rupee, Aomula fell by 0.75 rupees, and Bairuo溪 fell by 0.5 rupees. Recorded by Yuan Dianlu Zuo (8th dispatch).</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 20 to 30 shipments from the river-bottom. Sales were sluggish. Package deals were disastrously low due to prices in other regions. Merchants were unwilling to buy much, with only 300-400 shi being traded. The market was quiet, and transactions were scarce. Sutung and South Port Qing rice fell slightly by two to three jiao. Changbang and Duyangjian followed suit with a decrease of one to two jiao. Standard silver dollars remained stable. No factory goods were traded.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, all river-bottom groups had over ten shipments. White polished rice sales were sluggish. Those that cut prices sold a little better. The market price dropped slightly by one to two jiao. The arrival of thin paddy rice was limited, and sales were flat. The market price remained constant. There were a few retail sales of early rice at a slightly lower price. The arrival of Dugu tips was limited, and sales were sluggish. The market price was stable. The arrival of Yangjian continued, but sales were slack. The market price was weak by about one chi. Silver dollars were stable. White dollars were down slightly by two to three jiao. Premium customers were sluggish.</p>
<h3 id="e227">More Arrivals of Ke Xian Than Sales <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, Ke Xian rice continued to arrive, and a small number of Ke Yuan also arrived in Shanghai. Statistics show there were another 4,000 to 5,000 bags. Due to the unstable situation and poor financial conditions, cargo owners mostly wanted to sell quickly. Although there were local and Minbang groups continuing to purchase, arrivals exceeded sales, and prices continued to fall by about five fen. Ke Yuan and Min-style substitutes were still active, and the market could temporarily stabilize. Because of consecutive days of decline, later arrivals could be reduced, and Min-style sales were becoming smoother. The local market traded 150 bags of Hunan oil rice at 8.65 yuan per bag. 823 bags of late Jiangxi machine rice were traded at 8.89 yuan per bag. The Minbang group purchased 454 bags of Wuhu machine rice from the weeds at 9.80 yuan to 9.50 yuan per bag. 50 bags of Nanjing machine rice were traded at 9.75 yuan per bag. 700 bags of Hunan machine red unfinished rice were traded at 8.56 yuan per bag, and 200 bags of late Jiangxi machine rice were traded at 8.90 yuan per bag. It is thought that future market activity from local buyers might lead to a return to level prices, but with too much rice stored in production areas, or continued shipments, the market price is difficult to predict.</p>

<p>Yesterday, sales of interior yellow soybeans in carload lots were seen. However, the market situation showed little improvement. In short, cake sales have not surged, and the oil market is weak. Therefore, everyone is eager to sell. However, inventories are not thick, and the market is slightly firmer within the weakness. Green beans saw balanced arrivals and sales, and the market situation was somewhat established. The Ningbo group purchased 600 bags of Gaoyou green beans. 1,500 bags of black beans were traded, down 7 fen, purchased by the Guangdong group. Mung beans remained weak, and high-quality goods continued to sell. The rest were generally flat and weak.</p>

Chaoqing was opened in small quantities, with prices similar to before. Jianbing's inventory was thin, and the listed price was firm, showing no sign of loosening. Due to the inverted relationship between the local price of Zhangdiaoqing and the Shanghai market, a message was received yesterday stating that it was slightly looser, but still not cost-effective.</p>

<p>— Shou Juan</p>
<p>No matter which country's literary writers and novelists, it is not uncommon to be a nationally famous literary writer or novelist. It is rare and valuable to become a world-renowned literary writer or novelist. Maxim Gorky of Russia is one of the world-renowned literary writers and novelists of the present era. The Russian people respect and adore him even more than Stalin, who is in charge of the national regime. His pen is truly mightier than ten million spears. Gorky is indeed a pen name; his real name is Peshkov, which few people know. However, the name Gorky is well-known to every household. His hometown is Nizhny Novgorod. His birthday is March 14, 1868; he is exactly sixty-five years old this year. He has held many professions in his life and often changed them, breaking all records for literary writers and novelists. According to the items in his autobiography: In 1878, he became an apprentice shoemaker. In 1879, he became an apprentice painter. In 1882, he worked as a dishwasher on a steamer. In 1883, he became a baker. In 1884, he was a gatekeeper for others. In 1885, he returned to baking. In 1886, he became a singer in a band. In 1887, he was an apple peddler. In 1888, because he became impatient with life, he joined a suicide society and prepared to commit suicide. In 1891, he worked as a lawyer's clerk. In 1892, with nothing to do, he became an unemployed vagrant, traveling all over Russia. In 1893, he worked as a worker on the railway. Seeing all his experiences, it is like the oral performance of the Su Tan singers of our country, the wandering rogue who abandoned ten professions. However, he has thus become knowledgeable and finally became a literary writer and novelist who is good at writing about the suffering of the common people. His articles are written with the tip of his pen dipped in his own blood, sweat, and tears. In 1894, he began to publish his first short stories, and later he made many novels, short stories, and plays, filled with compassion between the lines, so he is still an authority in the new Russian literary world. I have translated two of his short stories: 1: [Green Cat], 2: [Ill-fated Woman].</p>

<p>— Guo Lanxin</p>
<p>A serious national crisis is unfolding before us, but the people in the city are still living a life of drunken stupor as if in a dream. Everyone believes that the sound of guns and cannons in the northeast border is not as tense and frightening as the Battle of Shanghai last year. Therefore, the national crisis remains a national crisis, and I continue to enjoy myself. Now let's go on a pilgrimage to the dance halls.</p>
<p>In the dance halls of Shanghai, the music is loud, the dancers are numerous, the lights are bright, and the alcohol flows. In such intoxicating places of enjoyment, many patriotic people who are enthusiastic about saving the country are found. During the day, they made passionate and慷慨speeches, but that's all they were. At night, they are buried in the places they condemned during the day. Ah, what a great contradiction!</p>
<p>In the Grand LaFayette Garden, several comrades who advocate saving the country through dancing were found. I don't believe that holding a soft and warm jade embrace, following the melody of the gentle sound, and dancing on the smooth floor, isolated from the outside world full of hunger, cold, poverty, can save the country through entertainment?</p>
<p>In the Moon Palace, in the Great East, in the New New, which place retains the shadow of the national crisis, which place holds the indignation of saving the country? A bird's nest in a dangerous building, fish swimming in a boiling pot. Continuing to enjoy ourselves like this, the great Republic of China will easily perish. Things must first rot before worms grow; people must first insult themselves before others insult them; a country must first attack itself before others attack it. May the people who enjoy themselves examine these words with their conscience!</p>

<p>— Sleeping Buddha</p>
<p>The northwest wind is what saves the country, while the southeast wind only destroys it!</p>
<p>I say this not because I am crazy, but because my feelings are too deep. I have seen the ice freezing on the river this time. A few days ago, the northwest wind blew like a hammer and scissors day and night, and the thermometer naturally dropped to zero. Although this gift from the northwest wind is incomparable to the bloody battles of our volunteer soldiers outside the customs, it is still enough for the people of Jiangnan, who are accustomed to warmth, to endure. However, we can feel interest while shivering, especially the children, because the water in the ten-foot-wide ditch has frozen into an inch of ice, which looks like a large mirror. Unfortunately, there are no young men and women in the style of Beiping here, except for the innocent children competing in races on the ice. Otherwise, this exhilarating ice skating will surely create a new record. The northwest wind keeps blowing, and the ice keeps freezing. The ships are all parked on the shore, unable to move for one day, two days, three days. The sun, which illuminates the earth, exerts its heat as much as possible, but it has never damaged it in the slightest! On the morning of the fourth day, the wind still came from the northwest, and the water source naturally taught people to look at it with new eyes. Suddenly, the sun seemed to retreat in shame, but the upper layer of the ice showed a patch of oily color, like a beauty with tears in her eyes. In the afternoon, it quietly disintegrated. By the time dusk was dim, the sound of oars was sent into the eardrums in bursts. It turned out that from ten o'clock that day, the northwest wind changed to the southeast wind. The cold remained the same, but the ice was all blown by the southeast wind to the land of nothing without resistance. While the sun was blushing and setting, it proudly radiated ten thousand rays of golden light, seemingly deliberately boasting its victory to the earth, and it was not ashamed to take the beauty of others.</p>
<p>Spinning horse lanterns, lion lanterns, airplane lanterns are even more exquisite and beautiful in the hands of several modern girls. Pairs of lovers strolled on Guanqian Street at dusk, crowded together, carrying Ye Shouhe's pastries and Caizhizhai's melon seeds... Is this a good phenomenon in Suzhou?</p>
<p>[Going out to aid] [Ready to fight with spears as pillows] [Volunteering to kill the enemy] [Advancing forward with a crossbow] [Armed resistance] [Recovering lost territory] [……] [……] This is equivalent to ice, condensed by the northwest wind and eliminated by the southeast wind.</p>
<p>[Old North Wind] is truly worthy of its name. The southeast wind, which is good at management, will also sigh here that its skills are exhausted. Even if it were given wings, it would not fly a step out of the customs, break through the northwest wind's barrier, and dream even more about it!</p>
<p>The northwest wind is what saves the country, while the southeast wind only destroys it!</p>

<p>The magnificent Xuanmiao Temple in the style of a palace always has a fluctuating crowd flowing in and out every afternoon. There are crane-like handsome men, snake-like charming women, and even little sisters and little brothers... Crowded! Fluctuating! Bustling, but it actually benefits the dim sum shops, grocery stalls, magic tricks, Suzhou operas, porcelain shops, bird shops... Women dig in their leather bags, and men grope around their bodies. Walking out of the temple gate, beggars nail themselves behind them, calling out to ladies, young ladies, young mistresses, young masters, but they are reluctant to take out a copper coin!</p>
<p>The [Journey to the West] scenery is really good, and the film of The Comedy of Marriage is also good. The prices of both places are very cheap. Get drunk, get drunk in the theater, in the cinema.

<p>— Mo Yi</p>
<p>After another burst of gunfire, bullets, as always, rained down on them. Then came another series of groans, sorrows, and hums. Bright red blood flowed, flowed, flowed, flowed incessantly...</p>
<p>Da... Da da... Da da da... Da da da da da da da... Da da da da da da... Da da da da da... Da da da da da da da... Da da da... Da da... Da...</p>
<p>Zhang Rongji seemed to hear a command, and the machine gun stopped firing.</p>
<p>[Ha... Haha... Hahahaha...]</p>
<p>[Ha... Haha... Hahahaha...]</p>
<p>In a burst of leather shoes, there was a burst of crazy laughter.</p>
<p>[This kid is not dead yet, he's moving, give him a bayonet!]</p>
<p>[This kid is still humming, come, give him a bayonet too!]</p>
<p>[Ah... Ah... Ah... Ah]</p>
<p>[Yo... Yo... Yo... Yo]</p>
<p>Several people who were not dead from the bullets were now stabbed a few more times with bayonets and involuntarily let out miserable exclamations; then they fell silent: they were probably all dead.</p>
<p>[This guy is covered in blood, really beautiful in red!... Hey, that's strange, how come this guy doesn't have any holes in him!...]</p>
<p>Zhang Rongji first felt that there were two people standing beside him, and then he suddenly felt lighter on his body. He understood that the people who were pressing on him had all been kicked away by the enemy. After a while, his legs were replaced by two feet, and he heard the enemy say these words. He thought, [Alas, it's over, there's no way I can live...] (9)</p>

<p>— Yi An</p>
<p>The clay figurines of Wuxi are indeed good, at least they are delicate and concise, with strong contrast in colors, which easily attracts the attention of children. The faces of the sculpted children are all cute, and they are typical appearances of children in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions: narrow eyes, long eyebrows, round and prominent faces, grinning smiles, but it is a pity that the faces of every child made by every family are exactly the same. If the effect of education also becomes like this, then mankind can truly be driven by machines.</p>
<p>I had passed through Wuxi many times before, and each time I recognized it as Wuxi because of the many chimneys. I thought that once I arrived in Wuxi, I would be in a forest of chimneys, and I would inevitably have to worry about walking around the chimneys in circles. It wasn't until I actually arrived in Wuxi that I was relieved that there weren't as many chimneys as I had expected, although they could be seen everywhere.</p>
<p>Huiquan water is about half a cent higher than the cup's edge without overflowing, which is said to be a miracle. Later, we tried pouring their tea into cups at a restaurant on Wanqian Road, and it was also about half a cent above the edge of the cup without overflowing. The restaurant did not use Huiquan water. However, you can still argue like this: this is still Wuxi water after all. Back in Shanghai, I poured a full cup of tea, and it could be about half a cent above the edge of the cup without overflowing in the same way. According to them, Huiquan water has a higher amount of iron and is heavier in volume than water from other places. I think it may be true that the water quality is different from other places, but it may not have much to do with whether it overflows or not.</p>
<p>Near Huiquan, there is a small square pond, about three or four feet square and three or four feet deep. Tourists throw copper coins down, because the copper coins do not sink straight to the bottom, but must go down in a zigzag line, so they admit that the water here is magical. After the tourists throw the copper coins down, they certainly do not pick them up, because showing stinginess is a small matter, but irreverence towards this sacred spring is a big matter. I remember that there is also one in Longjing or Hupao in Hangzhou, and there is also a small pond on top of Taoguang where people throw copper coins into it like this. As for why the copper coins do not accumulate so much that they fill up and who cleans them up, it is an incomprehensible matter. Today, as I write this passage at home, thinking about it, I put down my pen, took two copper coins, filled a bucket with tap water, and after the water ripples stopped, I dropped the two copper coins one by one. The zigzag sinking situation was not much different from the shadows of the famous mountains and holy springs. The famous scenic spots and historical sites must always maintain a little mystery to be interesting. It is a bit煞风景 for me to stubbornly expose them like this, sin sin! At this point, I should recite [Namo Amitabha] three hundred times.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Basic English of 850 Words <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>A famous British psychologist and ethicist, Professor Ogden of Cambridge University, invented a basic English. This basic English only needs 850 words. The inventor firmly believes that these 850 words are sufficient for all applications. If foreigners can learn these 850 words and some simple sentence structure methods, they can use English freely and without obstacles. Among the 850 words, there are 600 nouns, including concrete and abstract ones; 150 adjectives; and 100 other miscellaneous words. Among these 100 miscellaneous words, there are only 14 verbs. In order to prove the possibility of this basic English, Ogden used these 850 words to narrate the entire famous work The Gold Bug by Edgar Allan Poe, and the result was extremely fluent. In this basic English, there is no word [fly], so it is replaced by [go into the air]; there is no word [shout], so it is replaced by [say loudly]; there is no word [sing], so it is replaced by [make sweet sounds], etc. It is easier than our country's Civilian Thousand Character Lesson.</p>

<p>— Li Ying</p>
<p>[Okay?] I’ll go back, can you let me wander around a little bit more? His wife was so gentle, her smile, her words, left A-Lao with no choice. He looked again at her five-month-pregnant belly, and walked back towards the riverbank, saying as he went:</p>
<p>[You must go back before I come back with more mud.] He said, walking and turning his head back repeatedly.</p>
<p>After dinner, it was already dark. A-Lao heard his wife say that her stomach hurt a little. He was stunned for a moment, and suddenly a wave of darkness washed over him. But, he brushed it off with a cold glance and said to his wife:</p>
<p>[You go to bed, I’ll wash the dishes.]</p>
<p>So his wife went to bed, and A-Lao did all the things his wife was supposed to do. His heart was so flustered, he didn't know what to do. Then, he lit the lamp and ran to his wife's bedside.</p>
<p>His wife's stomach, she said, was hurting more and more. At first, she could still talk to him and answer his questions, but later she started rolling around in bed, just moaning [It hurts!][It hurts!]</p>
<p>A-Lao really didn't know what to do. He wanted to say: [I told you to come back earlier, you didn't listen, look what's happened….] But he couldn't say it, it would only make his wife feel worse. And it wasn't her fault either, he should blame himself. If he had money to hire someone, none of this would have happened!</p>
<p>He was afraid something bad would happen. He prayed, to get a doctor, but not only did he not have money, but there were none to be found in the countryside!</p>
<p>He kept praying, that was all he could do.</p>
<p>His wife writhed in pain, rolling, crying, screaming, how unbearable. He almost cried! His wife didn't say a word of blame to him, which made him feel even worse. He thought that at least his wife should say: [You poor wretch!]</p>
<p>After a long time, his wife seemed a little better, and A-Lao felt a little relieved. He thought that maybe nothing bad would happen. He prayed, praying for God's blessing.</p>
<p>But heaven does not care about these things. After a while, his wife's stomach started hurting even more severely. A-Rong panicked.</p>
<p>Everything is not something that heaven or God can protect, but rather something that follows the conditions of nature. For example: A-Rong had no money, so his wife had to work in the fields with a big belly, getting tired. The creature inside her changed, and in the end, after several bouts of severe pain, she finally miscarried, and the bed was stained with blood. Looking at the unrecognizable lump of flesh, A-Rong's wife, who had not yet lost her life, finally said several angry words to her husband, who was carefully attending to her:</p>
<p>[Can't we have a child? Poverty, poor people are really not human. But why are we poor? Aren't we working from morning till night? Why can those who are idle and do nothing have money and have children and grandchildren, while we who work so hard are so poor that we can't even have children? Tell me, are poor people really not human?….]</p>
<p>A-Rong just listened quietly, holding his wife's hand tightly, two lines of tears hanging in his eyes. After a while, he said angrily:</p>
<p>[No matter what! Poor people are also people, they also want to live, they must have children. We'll have more! One day, we will turn things around!]</p>
<p>His wife nodded weakly, and then used her weak hands to hug A-Lao tightly, saying intermittently: [Success… Want to have… a child! Poor people are… also… a life! Must have… a child…] On their two aching hearts, there seemed to flicker a glimmer of light. (The End)</p>
<h3 id="e265">George Bernard Shaw Visits China <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Xuan</p>
<p>The veteran of the British literary scene, George Bernard Shaw, is currently on a world tour and will soon arrive in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Chinese intelligentsia probably haven't forgotten that this old Mr. Shaw was enthusiastically introduced during the May Fourth Movement ten years ago, right? Mentioning Ibsen will likely bring George Bernard Shaw to mind, right? You'll probably think of the question raised in "Mrs. Warren's Profession" – the contradictions inherent in capitalist civilization. How enthusiastically did it draw the attention of young people during the May Fourth Movement?</p>
<p>All of Mr. Shaw's works are a critique of capitalist civilization. His style combines humor and cold satire. When we read about the "gentleman soldier" who puts chocolate creams in his bullet box in "Arms and the Man," we will definitely laugh, but in our laughter, we will also definitely feel a thread of bitterness and coldness, right? In this great play, Mr. Shaw exposed all the flattery and embellishment of modern warfare by spokesmen for imperialism! All the big, deceitful lies – what fighting for world civilization, fighting for justice – Mr. Shaw punctures them all with a light laugh!</p>
<p>He is different from Galsworthy, who recently passed away, who also enjoyed great fame in the British theater scene and who won last year's Nobel Prize in Literature. Although Galsworthy's works seem on the surface to also expose the contradictions and corruption of modern capitalist society, at their root he still affirms the current system and defends it.</p>
<p>Since the European War, many old European literary giants who once regarded themselves as warriors of life have reversed course. Those who have not reversed course but are advancing more vigorously towards the light include Romain Rolland in France and George Bernard Shaw in England. Both have denounced the atrocities of imperialism. At a time when the Pacific Ocean is fraught with danger, and imperialism is stepping up its preparations for the division of China and the attack on the Soviet Union in a world war, we welcome George Bernard Shaw's visit to China and hope that he will be able to participate in the survey mission organized by the World Anti-Imperialist League, which will also soon arrive in China!</p>
<h3 id="e266">Ten Greatest People of the Contemporary World <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Xue Dakang</p>
<p>I believe that [great men] are not [heroes], and even less are they [powerful officials] or [wealthy people]. Only those who can seek welfare for the [masses], sacrifice for the [masses], or whose words and deeds are sufficient to influence history or even advance history, can be regarded as [great men]. Based on this principle, the [Ten Greatest People of the Modern World] that I have proposed are the following ten:</p>
<p>(1) Gandhi Tagore once said: [Gandhi's life is synonymous with sacrifice.] This is truly a portrayal of Gandhi's entire personality. He led a colonial revolutionary movement in India, and resolutely struggled for the independence and liberation of oppressed peoples. Although his peaceful [non-cooperation movement] has its flaws, the rapid development of India's national independence movement under his leadership is an obvious fact.</p>
<p>(2) Stalin He is the leader of the only [socialist country] in the world today. The success of the Five-Year Plan under his leadership has further consolidated the economic foundation of the Soviet Union, causing capitalist powers to be alarmed and at a loss.</p>
<p>(3) Einstein This is a great scientist. His invention of the [theory of relativity] corrected Newton's [laws of mechanics] and brought about a major revolution in the scientific community. Although he himself once said that there are less than a dozen people in the world who can fully understand his theory, there is no doubt that his work is for the benefit of all mankind. (4) Kemal He is the builder of New Turkey. Under his leadership, the Turkish people, through three years of sustained hard work, defeated the Greek army and saved Turkey from its doom.</p>
<p>(5) Mussolini What is Mussolini? He is a demon and also a maverick. The [Fascist movement] he leads is an obstacle to the progress of the wheels of the times. However, he was able to bring Italy, which was in chaos and weakness after the war, into the ranks of strong countries, and he is ultimately not a [great man.]</p>
<p>(6) Gorky Gorky is the spokesman for the abused masses in the Soviet Union, no, the whole world. He not only speaks out about all the sufferings of the abused masses, but he also encourages, persuades, and guides the literary activities of the [lower classes]. (7) Madame Curie She is the discoverer of radium and has won the Nobel Prize in Physics twice.</p>
<p>(8) Trotsky He personally created the Red Army. In the early days of the Soviet revolution, he commanded twelve fronts. Although he is now exiled for betraying his cause, his great achievements in creating the Soviet Union cannot be denied.</p>
<p>(9) George Bernard Shaw He is a anti-imperialist writer in the most radical imperialist country. He has overflowing talent and rich knowledge. His works are full of humor.</p>
<p>(10) Hoover He is the soon-to-be-out-of-office President of the United States. His plan to suspend war debts and reparations in installments a few years ago gave the world a relatively strong response.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>[They’re tired, they’ve fallen sound asleep. Damn it!!! Only I’m left here in the middle of the night, unable to sleep! That’s right, that Japanese guy is sleeping in Professor Zeng’s study on the third floor. I didn’t see him go up there tonight. How bold!]</p>
<p>He eavesdropped for a while, but still couldn’t make sense of it, so he returned to the third floor, dejected. He walked to the door of Mr. Zeng’s study again, and gently pushed the door. It seemed to be locked from the inside, so the stone that had been pressing on his chest lightened.</p>
<p>[She must have come to see me, but because I was asleep, she didn’t want to disturb me, so she left.]</p>
<p>He comforted himself in this way and went to bed. He felt that his nerves were a little numb and a little throbbing. He</p>
<p>really wanted to sleep, but no matter what, he just couldn’t fall asleep. He looked at his watch again, it was half past three.</p>
<p>When he woke up the next morning, it was already past seven o'clock. He looked out the window and didn't see any sunlight, just a gray-white sky. He thought, the weather is changing to low pressure again, just like Mrs. Tsuruko's face last night.</p>
<p>In recent days, he had relaxed his schoolwork compared to when he first entered the school, and often skipped classes. So when he got up this morning, he didn't really care whether he would be able to make it to the first class or not. He was just thinking about Mrs. Tsuruko.</p>
<p>[I have already become her prisoner in spirit!]</p>
<p>He had just rolled over and sat up in bed, and was rubbing his eyes. The maid brought him a letter, and he took it in his hand and looked at it. There was no postage stamp on the envelope.</p>
<p>[Who brought it? Not the postman?]</p>
<p>[Not the postman. A young man brought it, dropped the letter, and left.]</p>
<p>He felt that the handwriting on the envelope was familiar, but he couldn't remember who it was from. He hurriedly opened it.</p>
<p>[Brother Haiquan, Mr. Chen invites you to meet him at 8 o'clock tonight. There are matters regarding the literary discussion group that need to be discussed. Please come to my place at half past seven to go together. Knowing this, your brother, the 7th morning.]</p>
<p>Although there was no signature at the end of the letter, he knew that it was written by Tang Yaoxing. After reading the letter, he felt a little unhappy again. First, because the revolutionary writer Mr. Chen Zemin always refused to tell him his address; second, because Tang Yaoxing was always sneaky and never frankly told him their bottom line; third, he refused to sign his real name at the end of this letter. These questions finally aroused Haiquan's antipathy towards them. After reading it, he crumpled the letter into a ball and threw it into the wastebasket. His thoughts turned back to Mrs. Tsuruko. At the same time, he felt an unspeakable annoyance.</p>
<p>He took his toothbrush and towel and walked lazily to the second floor. As he entered the bathroom, he suddenly saw Mrs. Tsuruko's door open. He couldn't restrain himself any longer, and walked forward quietly, wanting to peek inside to see what she was doing in her room.</p>
<p>If he hadn't looked, it would have been better. When he saw the situation in the room, his jealousy exploded.</p>
<p>Mrs. Tsuruko was still wrapped in bed with her hair disheveled, only her snow-white arm was stretched out outside the quilt. She was holding a cigarette between her index and middle fingers, and puffs of white smoke were coming from her mouth. The Japanese guy was still wearing a long Chinese cotton robe, holding a cigarette in his hand, sitting on the edge of the bed at the foot of the bed, leaning against the bed railing, as if he was talking and laughing with Mrs. Tsuruko.</p>
<p>[This is outrageous!]</p>
<h3 id="e268">How to Avoid Tragedy After Marriage? (2) <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Fengcheng</p>
<p>Third, the disharmony of each person's thoughts and actions. During courtship, the two sides often rely on momentary impulsive passion or hold the view that [love has no conditions], and rarely pay attention to each other's thoughts and actions. Just look at the love letters, those that focus on the discussion of ideas are a very small minority, most of them are completely the expression of emotions. Sometimes, people may also pay attention to ideological aspects, but their discussions are very superficial and unrealistic, not as practical as discussions with friends. Moreover, during courtship, their thoughts are very easy to converge. For example, if the man is a Christian, the woman, because of her love for him, often becomes a Christian or quasi-Christian. Or if the man was originally a very active youth participating in the revolution, but the woman does not approve of this dangerous and unstable life, then the man often gives up all his work and lives a decadent and hedonistic life with the woman. Therefore, if their thoughts are inconsistent during courtship, two possible tragedies may occur after marriage: the first is that after marriage, it is discovered that each person's thoughts and actions are absolutely or greatly incompatible. The two therefore break up or separate; the second is that after marriage, the man adapts to the woman, or the woman adapts to the man, and as a result, the two go down the road of decadence or indulgence together. As for those who, because of differences in thought and action, can instead go together on the path of a correct and active life after marriage, although there are such people, they are a very small minority.</p>
<p>Fourth, the disharmony of sexual function after marriage is often a major cause of tragedy. We know that sexual desire is one of the human instincts, and sexual life occupies an important part of married life. During courtship, the sexual aspect is often the most neglected. People simply cannot know the other party's sexual situation at all. But after marriage, often all their conditions are suitable, but because the sexual aspects cannot be reconciled, many tragedies occur. Marriage is a union of body and soul. We are not idealists, so of course we cannot rely entirely on the union of souls and ignore sexual harmony. Because sexual desire is a human instinct, the degree of strength of each person is often different; the woman cannot exactly adapt to the man's requirements, and the man cannot exactly adapt to the woman's needs. In this regard, it has a great impact on their future happiness. Also, regarding childbirth, the woman may not want to sacrifice her youth and spirit for the sake of children, while the man very much hopes to have a child. In this regard, they are also incompatible.</p>
<p>Of course, there are other possible causes of tragedy after marriage. I am only listing some of the most common and easily occurring points that are most easily overlooked.</p>
<p>How can we avoid the occurrence of tragedy after marriage? Let's discuss it! (The End)</p>

<h3 id="e269">Turkish Women's Bathhouse <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Xiangci</p>
<p>After the slogan of overthrowing shame and decency was raised, [shame] and [decency] were originally not a problem. Any shameless act could be done boldly, there was originally nothing to say. Although that’s the case, but [a sense of shame and dislike, everyone has it]. When it comes to being embarrassed, one always feels a bit awkward, so I can’t say whether there’s any value in discussing this later on. But we can still talk about it now.</p>
<p>I saw in the newspaper yesterday a funny scene at a Turkish women's bathhouse, which is quite amusing. I will transcribe it below.</p>
<p>In Adana, Turkey, just as a certain women's bathhouse was packed with customers, a female customer shouted wildly [Run for your lives, the building is collapsing!] The order was immediately disrupted. The female customers didn’t have time to put on their clothes. All naked, they ran wildly along the road. As a result, the order on the road was also disrupted by the crowds vying to see the model parade. After investigation, the bathhouse had not collapsed. It was a prank by the female customer, it was said.</p>
<p>Indeed, this funny scene of a model parade must have been quite a sight to see. Many naked women running along the street, shy and embarrassed, must have had a look of embarrassment. If I were in Turkey, I might also be standing by and watching, clapping, laughing, and shouting, [Good show!]</p>
<p>But, no, if I were to meet friends who are accustomed to sunbathing and white female comrades who advocate nude parades, they wouldn’t care about this. They certainly wouldn't change color or lose their composure. They’re accustomed to being naked, so what’s so rare about it? Especially Chinese female comrades, they shouldn’t care, but why is that? I have newspaper evidence.</p>
<p>It was reported in the newspaper last year that a Westerner in Hong Kong initiated a nude convention. Many Chinese and Western women joined enthusiastically, but while Western women nominally joined, few actually did it, while many Chinese women joined and were able to personally try it out. Therefore, the development of the association was largely due to the help of Chinese women.</p>
<p>If we look at it this way, Chinese women are, after all, more open-minded. They can not only talk but also act. I have two more things as evidence. Recently, Western women have been fashionable to go barefoot in the summer, so in the parks at dawn or dusk, one can see many Chinese modern women walking barefoot among them. This shows how strong the imitative nature of Chinese women is. This is one thing. Also, men in various countries mostly cut their hair, while very few women cut their hair, but Chinese women, since recent years, have cut off eighty or ninety percent of their three thousand strands of sorrow, leaving no room for hope. This is another thing.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, [When the city loves a tall bun, those from all directions will raise theirs a foot higher.] Imitating trends and intensifying them is truly a special skill of Chinese women. If Chinese women were to encounter such a trick, I don't think they would blush or turn red. They could just stride onto the road without having to run wildly. The Turkish women's prank wouldn't be worth a smile from an expert.</p>

<h3 id="e270">Photography <a href="#e270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— Zhidao</p>
<p>Now, if we take a convex lens and place it between a candle flame and a piece of paper, a inverted image of the candle flame will be produced and projected onto the paper. If we insert this lens into a cylindrical tube, so that the inverted image it produces enters a dark box, we have a photographic apparatus. A glass plate is placed at the bottom of the box, coated with a chemical. This chemical changes when exposed to light, which enables the image projected upon it to remain on the glass surface. It photographs an object and captures its image. However, silver chloride is too sensitive to light and is not easily preserved for a long time, so silver iodide or silver bromide are used instead, coated on the glass plate, and placed inside a dark box, to receive light. The ones using silver iodide are wet plates, and the ones using silver bromide are dry plates.</p>
<p>To make a wet plate, first, add a little potassium iodide or ammonium iodide to collodion.</p>
<p>Apply it to the surface of the glass plate to form a thin film (collodion is cotton gunpowder dissolved in alcohol and ether, viscous like glue. When collodion is applied to the glass surface, the ether and alcohol evaporate and the collodion becomes a thin layer.) Next, take the glass plate to a dark room and immerse it in a silver nitrate solution, so that the silver and iodine combine to form silver iodide, which precipitates in the membrane of the glass plate. Place it in a dark box. When taking a picture, the light reflected from the object is stronger than elsewhere, and the silver iodide decomposes, absorbing oxygen and turning into silver oxide. Take it out and immerse it in ferrous sulfate or pyrogallic acid solution. The iodine silver oxide is reduced, resulting in fine silver spots, which are dark black, adhering to the object image. The rest of the sensitized area, because its substance is still silver iodide, is not reduced, thus revealing the object image, called the development. After the image's brightness is suitable, wash it with light, and immerse it in potassium cyanide or sodium thiosulfate solution, then silver iodide dissolves deeply when it encounters it, but the reduced silver does not change and remains, which can make the image more firm, which is called fixing. This image's light and dark are opposite to the real object, but it can be the base of the positive image, and cannot be used for supply, commonly known as the negative. (or called negative image or plate)</p>
<p>To make a dry plate, use gelatin and silver bromide solution, and apply it to the glass plate. Using this plate to take photos, its photosensitive change is faster than silver iodide, so modern people all use this plate, called fast plate. Its development and fixing methods are slightly the same as wet plates.</p>
<p>To get a positive image from the negative, it is advisable to overlay and print with albumen paper once. The albumen is mixed with ammonium chloride, coated on the paper surface, and immersed in silver nitrate solution to form silver chloride. Place it in a dark room to dry it, cover it with a negative, and expose it to sunlight, so that silver chloride is reduced. Turns into silver oxide, showing a purplish brown color, and the positive image of the organism.</p>
<p>The positive is called the printed image, washed, and immersed in a gold plating solution (dissolve a small amount of gold chloride in water and add a little sodium carbonate to make it alkaline), then silver oxide can absorb</p>
<p>the chlorine gas in gold chloride, making gold reduced, and having fine gold spots, being dark purple, adhering to the paper surface, making the object image clear. This is called plating the image.</p>

<p>(1) The same thing is that although the weather is cold, and goose feather-like snow is falling non-stop, if you step into the door of a movie theater, you only hear a chorus of voices shouting "Ice cream! Ice cream!" But at the same time, what about the Northeast? The pitiful and loyal volunteer army, they are resisting stubborn enemies and puppet troops in snow several feet deep, with water freezing into ice. They have no support, and soon, when they have no food to eat, they will probably have to eat ice like the people eating ice cream in the movie theater.</p>
<p>(2) The same thing is that in the old Lunar New Year's Eve and New Year's Day, you only hear the sound of firecrackers popping and banging! But at the same time, in the Northeast, the enemy's artillery fire is making the same banging sounds! And what about our loyal volunteer army? Because of the lack of ammunition, they can only make less noise. I wonder why those people who set off firecrackers don't use the money to buy firecrackers to buy ammunition and help the Northeast to make some noise?</p>
<p>(3) The same thing is that in Shanghai, there are many people who smoke opium, and they all have a gun (opium pipe) because that gun is a necessity, without it, they cannot smoke. Now let's talk about the volunteer army in the Northeast. Because they have not received subsidies from the government, their resistance to Japan is entirely out of patriotic thought, so their guns (guns for killing the enemy) are also limited. But without guns, they cannot resist Japan. I think it would be best if all the people in Shanghai who smoke opium abandoned their opium pipes and used the money to buy opium to buy guns for killing the enemy. Wouldn't that be great? But I think it is definitely impossible in reality. (Moving funds to help the Northeast volunteer army)</p>
<h3 id="e273">Profound Performance <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>

<p>Yuguan has fallen; Old Chen, who considers himself a zealous patriot, bought several extra newspapers and pasted them on the door of the dormitory, writing the five large white characters of "Public Reading Place" beside them in pencil. He also wrote things like "[Fellow students! It's time for us to serve the country!]" and other slogans that didn't quite seem like slogans. Quite a few students were reading the newspapers, so Old Chen was very pleased with himself.</p>
<p>One day, Old Chen saw a passage in the newspaper that read, "Volunteer soldiers engage in hand-to-hand combat with the enemy, flesh and blood flying everywhere..." So Old Chen put on his military uniform, put on the iron helmet he picked up as a Boy Scout during the Shanghai Anti-Japanese War, and dragged Old Zhang, insisting that he accompany him in performing this scene.</p>
<p>"The area outside the pass is snowy and icy; it won't be very realistic to perform it here," Old Zhang hesitated.</p>
<p>"That's fine." Old Zhang came up with an idea. "I'll sacrifice a little." Old Zhang tore up his almost-finished calendar page by page, scattering them upwards, covering the entire room with paper scraps. It immediately looked like a snowy field, and they began to perform.</p>
<p>After a while, Old Chen got bored with the acting. He suggested that they teach Old Zhang to play General Ma Zhanshan, with him playing a Japanese spy, and Old Mao and Old Cheng playing sentries.</p>
<p>The drama began again with profound performance.</p>
<p>Old Zhang sat majestically on the bed, while Old Fan and Old Cheng, with Old Chen's hands tied behind his back, brought him to see Old Zhang.</p>
<p>"Are you a Japanese spy?" Old Zhang said in Mandarin. "You are indeed a spy. General Ma, you are fighting a desperate battle. What madness is this? I think you should surrender to us."</p>
<p>"Bullshit!" Old Zhang, enraged, raised his hand and slapped Old Chen twice, very hard.</p>
<p>"Damn it! We were just playing a role; why did you hit me so hard?" Old Chen revealed his true colors.</p>
<p>"That's what I call a profound performance!" Old Zhang laughed.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Due to our lack of knowledge and other various issues, we feel the need to unite and study together. Therefore, we have gathered several like-minded individuals and formed an "Amateur Academic Research Society." During this process, we have been supported and guided by you, making our society gradually develop. We are truly grateful beyond words! Currently, there are male and female comrades who are interested in academic research—some have volunteered to join, and others have been introduced by existing members—joining our group. So far, there are forty-eight people. However, for the sake of "prudence before organization," the formal establishment of our society still requires considerable preparation.</p>
<p>In the previous preparatory period, we have also held many preparatory meetings, and each meeting has often yielded new proposals, making our organization more perfect. Although there have been minor setbacks, we do not hesitate or become discouraged because of this; we always maintain a spirit of perseverance and strive to move forward.</p>
<p>Recently, we decided on two tasks to be carried out separately: 1) To ensure the legal status of the society, member Zhu Baolin is responsible for handling the registration procedures; 2) Due to the request of most new members, the society's research group will be established in advance. At the last meeting (the 5th), it was decided to temporarily establish four groups: agricultural science, engineering, commercial science, and literature. Furthermore, because many people are willing to study commercial science, the commercial science group has been established, and members Xie Zongyuan and Ni Zi have been elected as the leaders. By the next society meeting—this month's 12th, which is Sunday afternoon at 2:00 PM—research must begin. We not only hope that society members will attend at that time, but also welcome people from all walks of life to our society—located at Xin Zha Road, Da Tong Road, Little Vegetable Market, East Siwen Lane, Xin Zha Elementary School—to listen.</p>
<p>The above is a brief report on the past and present situation of our society. We think: Since you are "happy to support" us, you must also be happy to know. We will continue to report to you on how things progress in the future, but at the same time, we are eager for your guidance and correction.</p>

<p>Editor's Note: Since this column advocated "organizing groups," many groups have been formed in succession. However, the one that has progressed the fastest and achieved the best results is the "Amateur Academic Research Society." According to the letter, there are already forty-eight male and female comrades who have joined. However, they are not satisfied with this and want to continue their efforts, actually wishing to postpone the establishment meeting. On this point, our opinion is slightly different. Most Chinese people do not have the habit of organizing. To put it bluntly, the comrades of this society are no exception. If one side expands the number of members as much as possible, while the other side cannot effectively organize the group, then in the future, the more people there are, the more complex the opinions will be, and it will be impossible to unite. This is unavoidable. Moreover, if things are delayed in this way, the initial excitement of each member joining the society may be dissipated because of this. We believe that when the number of members reaches more than fifty, the expansion of the number of members should be temporarily stopped, and one or two months should be set aside to focus on discussing and enriching internal issues. After these fifty-odd people have received organizational training and organizational habits, they can then publicly solicit members. At this time, because there are these fifty-odd people as central figures, it does not matter even if some people without organizational habits join. That is our opinion. We wonder if the comrades of this society think it is correct?</p>
<p>As for the two recent resolutions: the first issue of "registration" must of course be handled, but it does not have much value for discussion. The second issue of the "research group" is extremely important, because this is where the spirit of the society lies! The discussion of this issue should focus on two points: "whether the grouping is appropriate" and "whether the method is effective." The opinion on grouping should of course be based on being able to categorize, but the issue of talent must also be considered. In each group, there must be at least one or two people who are somewhat knowledgeable and enthusiastic to take the lead, in order to arouse the strong interest of most members; otherwise, it is better to have quality over quantity. As for the method of research, we hope that the society will send us the records of this research group. We will see if we can find some opinions to offer for your reference.</p>
<p>It is best to allow outsiders to attend the "research group" sessions. Not only can this fully demonstrate your spirit of "helping others," but also, during the period when membership recruitment is suspended, it can create faith in the outside world. When it comes to publicly soliciting members, you can then fully promote it.</p>

<p>To whom it may concern: In the Science section of the Local Supplement of your newspaper on November 21, 21, Mr. Zhong Jun (signed) published a method for manufacturing calcium carbide. I have repeatedly tried to study and research the published procedures, but have not been able to achieve the finished product. I earnestly request your newspaper to forward to the former student to provide more detailed instructions and all kinds of original settings, which is my sincere hope. I have two questions and sincerely request Mr. Zhong Jun to provide detailed guidance to my company so that we can complete the process to resist the import of foreign goods into our country. 1) Where exactly does "dry coal" come from? Is it a mineral plant like the bituminous coal produced in Shanxi in the north, the Tangshan coal in Hebei Province, or the hard coal in Beiping? Or is it charcoal produced in various counties? 2) After grinding and mixing with quicklime, is cold water used for mixing? Or is water not used for mixing? Please provide detailed guidance on the above two points. Although I am not talented, I am determined to achieve success and will never turn back, fulfilling the duty of promoting domestic goods, so I venture to state this directly to your newspaper, troubling you to forward it to Mr. Zhong Jun. Please provide instructions as soon as possible so that I can proceed early. I hereby send this message and await your reply. Respectfully, Guo Aipu. If you would provide instructions, please let my company know through your newspaper.</p>

<h3 id="e276">A Scholarly Family (Continued 16) <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>He was very close to several tailors in the alley, because they could tell him stories about jumping insects. He often brought money home to treat them to drinks, pestering them to tell stories, disrupting their work. Sang Aqiang said a few words to him, and he rolled his eyes and scolded:</p>
<p>"This tailor shop was opened by us picking you. This is my place. I am the eldest young master of the family. Who dares to interfere with me? If you continue to act so seriously, I will drive you away tomorrow!"</p>
<p>Sang Aqiang was really angry listening to him, but to reason with him seriously, he was just a child, and he couldn't reason with him. He could only smile dryly at him:</p>
<p>"Good young master, I hope you will be the young master of this house for the rest of your life!"</p>
<p>"What's wrong? Are you angry that I'm being the young master?" Maosheng stuck out his neck, propped his hands on his waist, and swaggered to Sang's boss to provoke him. Sang's boss gently pushed him, and he fell to the ground and cried loudly. The boss's wife, Ali, came out to see what was happening, quickly helped him up, scolded Sang's boss for a while, and coaxed him for a long time, but he still refused to stop. Later, he rushed over and punched Sang's boss in the back dozens of times before he stopped crying and smiled. From then on, Sang's boss called him "Young Master" and dared not offend him again.</p>
<p>After Ruohua came home, Maosheng's arrogance diminished slightly, because this mother did not give him a good face. He did not want to stay at home, and spent the whole day messing around in the tailor shop. The tailors saw that Youzhong came and went very frequently, and deliberately taught Maosheng to go in and spy on Youzhong's movements. Maosheng snuck inside and peeped out, and then told them: sometimes his mother hugged Uncle Wang's face, sometimes they bathed in the same basin, and sometimes they closed the door tightly and couldn't see anything. The tailors also thought it was a fresh topic, and constantly flattered Maosheng, asking him for news, like an outside reporter sticking to someone for news.</p>
<p>One day, Maosheng stole into the inner room to gather news, and took advantage of the opportunity to steal a few cents from the room. Unfortunately, the plan was not airtight, and the maid saw it, grabbed him, and searched for the stolen goods on the spot. The maid reported it to the Madam, and brought him in for questioning. The evidence was conclusive, and he could no longer deny it. Youzhong, who was watching from the side, also advocated that he must be severely punished. So Maosheng was pressed on a bench, and Ruohua personally took action, hitting his buttocks more than a dozen times, making him scream like a slaughtered pig.</p>
<p>Maosheng was punished and went to complain to Ali. He hid the fact that he stole the money, only saying that his stepmother beat him cruelly for no reason and wanted to kill him. Ali had been entrusted by the late Madam to take care of Maosheng and had the power to supervise Maosheng. After listening to Maosheng's one-sided story, she felt that Ruohua was abusing him too much. She took him to see Madam Ruohua.</p>
