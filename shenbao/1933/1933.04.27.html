<p>[P猺王出世的幻夢</p>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>未開化的人民，依舊迷戀着帝王出世的幻夢，希冀奉天承運的基業，從幾柄切菜刀幾桿舊式烏槍　傳來；高唱着（興猺滅漢）的熱烈口號，以爲，在這口號上，便可以喝斷了漢人的魂，驚破了漢族的膽。結果，一和正式軍隊接觸，正如黄集遇見了秋風，一陣呌苦連天中，正不知喪失了多少生命？我對於桂省的漢陽，義寗，興安，全縣等處猺人叛變，便知道十一世紀的戰爭不論曲直，只論物質，物質不如人，却要希圖一逞，只可偶爾致勝，結果，没有不失敗的，桂省猺民，便是前車之鑒。</p>
<p>桂省猺民叛變的原由，都出於漢人激成，甘居化外的猺民，一向和漢人相安無事，爲什麽無端叛變呢？只因近三十年來，世界愈文明，人心却愈狡黠，遇見了渾沌未鑿的猺民，便如洋塲滑頭對付鄕下阿木林，專在侮辱壓迫中博取利益。因此，猺民便和漢人結下了深仇，宣言猺王出世，以資號召。又有興安縣漢人劉炳文，拉攏漢人中敗類，投機加入猺軍，一時聲勢頗壯。猺人見漢人附和，野心愈熾，立時祭旗舉事，以作大規模的猺人革命分撲各村，連陷縣邑，以實現其（興猺滅漢）的計畫。後來，十九師移軍征猺，分遣五十六，五十七兩團負責剿辦；說也可憐，仗着切菜刀掮着舊式烏槍的猺人，一排一排的中彈倒地而死了！一塲猺王出世的幻夢，都被猛烈的槍砲轟破，没奈何只有屈服於創深痛鉅之下了！</p>
<p>斬木爲兵，揭竿爲旗，只有物質不文明的秦始皇時，才許陳涉吴廣横行一世；假使，秦始皇也擁有了海陸空軍，那麽斬木揭竿的叛衆，來兩個，死一雙，試問可有幸成的希望麽？現在擁有海陸空軍的國際秦始皇正在那裹耀武揚威，知道舊時斬木揭竿的方式，是奈何他不得了，於是乎自空世界了。</p>

<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>西施大姑娘，是中國歷史上有名的美人兒。據說，西施大姑娘的美，就美在有心痛病而兩條柳眉兒打結。在那時候，可巧有一位東施大姑娘，本没有心痛病的，異想天開，也把二手捧着心，眉兒打着結，想合西施大姑娘賽一賽誰俊。豈知西施大姑娘的捧心，正如我們東亞病夫般的病得自然的，東施大姑娘的捧心，一派做作，敎人見着打噁心。所以有一個古典，呌做（東施效顰，）笑人（畫虎不成反類狗。）</p>
<p>歐風東漸，西方的蜜施與蜜雪施，大夥兒的向中國開拓。西方的蜜施與蜜雪施，六寸膚圓上，都吊着一雙高跟鞋，走起路來，乳兒在前面抖，臀兒在後面聳，果然好看。東方的蜜施與蜜雪施門，看得眼紅，也在初解放的金蓮上，吊上高跟鞋，拐呀拐的，來一下子。於是乎翻跟斗，扭脚筋等把戲，大觀洋洋不一而足。西方的蜜施與蜜雪施，生就是鬈頭髮，長睫毛，東方的蜜施與蜜雪施，又覺得别有風緻，忙也把黑髮兒　曲，眼圈兒塗黑，想賽一下子誰俊。無奈皮膚黄黄，眸子烏黑的，没有洗染成（白皮），（碧眼）（黄髮）以前，平拘效顰得怎樣道地，總掩不盡東施眞嘴臉。</p>
<p>西方的蜜施與蜜雪施，都談一個（社交公開），（自由戀愛），（女子獨立），（男女平等），可是東方的蜜施與蜜雪施效顰這一手，又得了（同途）之因，（異婦之果）一切都變成了（浪漫），（放縱），没籠頭的野馬。</p>
<p>西子捧心，東施效顰，成爲一個千古的笑柄。東方蜜施蜜雪施的事事效法西方蜜施蜜雪施，是否學到了恰到好處？還請效顰者　以語我來。</p>

<p>— 仲琴</p>
<p>我每走過這條熙熙攘攘的四馬路時，我總自己對自己說着··（朋友，在這兒是領導你到光明的路，滿足你的知識之慾，同時，在這兒也可以誘惑你，消磨了你的青年墮落！同在一條路上，却分了二條歧路，你走到這裏應當注意你的前面！那邊有無限的寳藏期待着你，但是那邊也有比毒蛇還毒比猛獸還猛的動物吸引着你！）尤其是在晚上我走過四馬路時要這樣的自言自語一番從東向西的走着，河南路開始，就是許多開啓知識之門的寳鑰掛在那邊，等待着牠的主人去拿，商務印書館，中華書館，世界，大東，開明，現代：：：等等，是寳鑰的安身之所，你可以去拿下來，青年們應當常常去找各人所需要的寳鑰。</p>
<p>再向西，在世界書局面前的水門汀行人道上，或者青光書局面前的行人道上，青年的行人走過時，尤其是學生模樣的青年走過時，那邊鵠立着的穿一件破長衫手裏拿着香烟屁股的便在青年的旁邊，鼻孔裏哼着··（春Ｘ要買？）這是第一步的引誘青年們入墮落之道。</p>
<p>再向西過去，一直到西藏路爲止，這一段中間，就是使青年失足的大本營，一到銀燈初上的時候，一羣的裝着小電燈的事中的動物，往來如梭，開始她們殺人工作，青年們偶一迷惑，依紅儇翠，失足墮落，是唯一的結果，然而現代的許多大學生，以至中學生，正不知多少沈溺於其間，雖死不悟，</p>
<p>總之四馬路是文化事業的中心點，同時也是罪惡的製造總廠，同在一條路上，一東一西，便顯出了絶對的相反，</p>

<p>— 洪慶</p>
<p>因爲敵人的兇鋒悍然闖入關内，其目的不僅在平津，連魯閩也在囊括之列的風傳，便想起福州來。福州，和臺灣只隔一水，自臺灣被割，早就在鷹瞵鶚視之下了；所以在福州的日僑，都帶點兒侵略性··雖然他們都是經商的　　日僑以南臺泛船浦爲最多，最大的商業是大坂商船株式會社，國輪遠不能及。例如國輪自馬尾羅星塔停泊下來，丨開赴福州的船不能直達内江丨用小輪駁運客貨至南臺，須另收每人五角，日輪則不另取費，自然旅客要樂乘日輪了。日僑又辦了一種閩報，爲輿論機關，最初本用中文，後來竟改爲中日合璧··這張報，在福州是超勢力，直言無忌，自然又是博得人愛看，爲國人自辦的報紙所不及。此外尚有博愛醫院，廬山軒照相館，都很有名。賣淫婦也不少。</p>
<p>福州的日僑帶有侵略性，不比他國僑民以經商爲本分，是很容易看得出的。他們把聚居之地造成櫻花色彩，走過那裏，好似不在福州，更覺可怕！特别還有許多臺灣人，都忘了祖國，爲虎作倀，常常發生侮辱國人的舉動。在方聲濤主政時代，遇事妥洽，希望省中無事；而終於不能無事。現在，敵人的兇鋒已闌入關内，魯閩都在野心囊括之列，一屆其時，南臺泛船浦一帶的日僑，少不了都是先鋒隊，這就在於現當局如何準備了。</p>

<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>我有一位朋友，他生平最怕到店裏去買東西，能夠不勞親自出馬，總是委託他人。有一次我問他，爲甚麽怕到店裏去買東西，是不是爲了怕麻煩？是不是爲了貪省力？他却嘆了一口氣道··都不是，都不是！我不情願去看這種店員的（晚爺面孔）和冷淡態度，所以怕到店裏買東西。的確有許多商店店員的面孔和態度，很容易趕走顧客，得罪顧客，莫怪我的朋友要望之生畏，不敢請敎，付之一漢了。莫怪一般從歐美日本走一趙回來的人，口口聲聲讚美歐美日本的商店店員，對於顧客如何如何客氣，謙和，有禮貌，有耐心，會做生意了。最近看到一本美國雜誌上，載着一篇很有價值的文字，我國商人值得一讀的。現在把大意述譯如下··</p>
<p>美國北部某鐵道的餐車，都是某老闆包辦的，營業非常發達，吃客個個滿意。據一、般的乘客說，他們的滿意，不在肴饌的精美可口，而在侍者的招待週到。</p>
<p>從前，某老闆不過在車站上開設一爿小酒排間。在此酒排間中，除了一切應有的設備和裝飾以外，還貼着一張非常醒目的標語，道··（主顧總是對的。）</p>
<p>某老闆一方面設法在肴饌上精益求精，另一方面却付全力於訓練侍者。訓練的方法非常神妙，每天抽出空閒的一二小時來，敎侍者做主顧，他老人家做侍者。怎樣招呼，怎樣端菜，怎樣對話，怎樣收錢，怎樣送客，一一的親自敎導他們。</p>
<p>在此當侍者的，除了把標語上的一句話時時刻刻記在心頭以外，還得隨時隨地的實行。倘使有位主顧以爲某菜做得不行，（其實很好，他却說不行）一定要換，侍者不允，那麽某老闆，知道了，馬上要敎這個違命的侍者（出夥，）全無交涉餘地；因爲進店時所訂的合同上早有（得罪主顧，立卽開除）的一項罰則。</p>
<p>因爲某老闆始終遵守了（主顧總是對的）一句標語，所以他永遠能夠得到（營業總是好的）的效果。假使我上面講到的這位朋友，見了這篇東西之後，一定又要嘆口氣道··我國有一部份的商店，不顯著地貼着（主顧總是錯的）的標語，所以他們永遠得到（營業總是差的）的報應。</p>

<p>商業廣告在帝國主義家中，列入大學學程，何等神聖莊嚴，商界鈎心鬭角，技巧者百出，發揚光大，大知到何等程度。可是在共產主義已由理想而達實行時期和我國已由理想而達實行復交的蘇俄，對於廣告，已成過去的名詞，簡直是不需要。因爲產物公有政策一日存在，廣告便一日成爲廢物。</p>
<p>蘇俄現在報紙中，銷路最廣者呌Ｐａｒｖｄａ，（案其義卽Ｔｒｕｓｔ信用）每天銷額二百萬份，當然是政府的機關報。所謂廣告者，祗有像申報的分類廣告，像房屋召租咧；招僱職工咧；傢具出讓咧，聲明遺失咧，此外遠有政府佈告民衆避免肺癆症的方法，以及警告飮酒，結果怎樣使人窮乏，這是毫無商業廣告性質之可言。</p>
<p>那末話又說回來了，蘇俄對於商業廣告的眞正意義，並非是不理會得，他們所有輸出的工業口，糧食海產等，他們對於包紥的整潔妥善，裝璜印刷的美觀講究，說明詞句的新頴别緻，都非常合乎廣告的原理，備具廣告的條件，這種克已厚人的精神，眞是民族性偉大的表現呀，</p>

<p>百米二百米及四百米二項賽跑、因參加人數衆多、特於昨日下午四時半起在中華田徑塲先行决斠、久雨乍霽、陽光普照、觀者十分踴躍、計百米男乙組共二十四次預賽、二百米甲乙組共十四次預賽、四百米共分四組預賽、直賽至暮色蒼茫、萬家燈火始畢</p>
<p>▲觀衆三千　春雨浹旬、不肯放睛、羣料將必影響及大會比賽、庸知天公格外做美、昨日清晨愁雲頓歛、麗日高昇、可愛之陽光、照遍曠大戰塲、午後二時許、聞風而來作壁上觀者、可得三千餘人、雖非重要節目、而吸引觀衆之力、已如此之宏、預料今日正式開幕、必然萬頭攢動鬨動一時矣、</p>
<p>▲會塲佈置　冷落已久之中華田徑塲、昨日頻增不少顏色、塲之東、北、正北搭設運動員臨時休息之兵房爲蘆蓆所製、各房門前均懸有各校校徽、五光十色、臨風飄動、氣象威嚴、兵房之側面、夾以童子軍之帆布營幕、互相輝映、益覺頰上添毫、司令臺在塲之西陲、就搭於看臺之上、龐大可容百人登臺四矚、全塲盡收眼底、殊爲得勢、</p>
<p>▲成績一瞥　觀昨日三項預賽成績、百米以十二秒正爲最佳、造成者爲民立劉嘉獻、其餘均在十二秒五分二以上、二百米最佳成績、爲光華董寅初之二十五秒、四百米均在五十八秒以上、預賽但求錄取、成績不加深究、或猶未盡量發展技術耳、</p>
<p>▲如是我覩　諸選手中、光華之董寅初、與南方中學之關長發、成績雖未見出色、然其身材適宜、盜勢優美、衝剌工夫、已至爐火純青、却係可造之才、複决賽中、二人可望良好青演、</p>
<p>▲偷跑者罰　昨日預賽、偷跑者甚衆、每次起步、時有先後之序、召回重跑之事、是以因偷跑罰出者、頗不在少、推其原因、可分二點、（一）訓練不功、平素練習、缺少純熟之起跑訓練、故不能聞槍起步、恰到妙處、（二）存心偷跑、欲藉希冀之心、僥倖獲勝、對此兩點、均非良好現象、亟　戒之、</p>

<p>▲三呼老爺　昨日雖係預賽、然各校爲爭複賽决賽計、故重視之不亞於决賽、所有之聲援隊、掃數到塲助威、民立同　尤覺烈熱、在百米甲第三組劉嘉猷造成良好紀錄以後、民立事生欣喜欲狂、至第五組開始、民立唐維俊、切齒搶得第一、同學在彼撞破光榮線三呼老爺、聲衝霄漢、</p>
<p>▲奈河狗洞　四百米告終、羣衆因天已入暮、近籃球房之塲東北緣邊、有水一　、寬及七尺中横一板、以當橋梁、板窄人多、羣衆大苦、遂有不得過者呼之奈河、旣過奈河、籃球房東邊有一竹籬笆、小門僅容一人進出、尚須微低其頭、此時竟如小鷄生蛋、擠軋非常、於是又被喻之爲狗洞、亦可謂趣而謔矣、</p>

<p>— 潘仰葊</p>
<p>提倡國貨，服用國貨，人人知之，人人言之，人人行之。而默察現狀，國貨前途，有兩大障碍，在此國貨年中，非努力掃除設法解决不可。</p>
<p>（一）爲農村經濟之衰落　國貨最大之來源，爲農村，而國貨最大之出路，亦爲農村。今中國農村到處現衰落之象，寗非國貨前途莫大之隱憂。今試考查各地農村，則農民十之八九缺乏購買力，國貨勢力雖漸漸深入内地，國貨之價廉物美，人人知之，中國人應用中國貨，人人能言之，其如室如懸磬，家徒四壁，無此購買力何？故國貨年中提倡國貨，而在此當前最急切之農村經濟衰落尚未解决以前，無論宣傳如何努力，工作如何緊張，恐事倍功半，成效式微。目前先决問題，惟有希望全國金融界實業界一致以救濟農村爲己任。如何研究種子與種植之改良，農具與肥料之精進，農村生活之改善，農村合作之實施，以及農民借貸，農民娱樂，農民敎育農民副業等等，均當出最大氣力下最大决心，竭誠救濟，全力協助。農村經濟，果能解决，則農民之生產力自增，而原料之來源，自感便利，農民之購買力自强，而出品之去路當然廣大。金融界之流通靈活，實業界之營業發展，救人即自救，利人即利己，此其一。</p>
<p>（一）爲日貨之無形暢銷　抵制劣貨，人人知之，人人能言之，人人能行之，而獨無法使劣貨之不銷行，無法使奸商之不販賣，無法使劣貨之不致深入内地。言集會以抵制，則反日會抗日會之前車，令人不寒而慄。因噎廢食，是用痛心，試往市場，明明日貨也，而標明製自英倫，製自德意志，製自意大利。明明日貨也，而改頭換面，以太陽商標，而改爲中華牌號矣。凡人而汨没良心，何事不可爲，奸商之肉可食，奸商之心可誅，願我商人從此不聞不問，任劣貨之勢如破竹，如入無人之境乎？此自殺之道。究其極，我國貨前途，必呈黯淡無光之象。故今日國貨界同人，毋以爲抵制劣貨，此政府事，此社會事，只知製造國貨，只願自己營業，而置劣貨之充斥不問，奸商之狡詐不願，此大誤也。目前唯一問題應一致集合公正人士，有正當之組會，作整個之對付，非達驅盡劣貨於中國市塲之目的不止。嗟乎，國難深矣，一般人往往言，政府不足恃，兵力因不能與抗，惟經濟上制其死命，則出自國民，自屬可能。今則併此經濟力之抵抗而不能乎？尚何言哉丨尚何言哉丨</p>

<p>施行科學管理之宗旨，爲謀管理之精密及效率之增加，以達到更大之目的，換言之，即爲使社會經濟進步，穩固而健全也。實業界之領袖須具有爲社會服務之精神，始能導實業於正軋，而收勞資合作之效。此項使命極其偉大，斷非使用不正當之手段，以謀一時之小利，而不顧勞資　方共同福利者，所能達到也。</p>
<p>在施行科學管理之計畫中，有若干制度及步驟，務須先行規定，以樹立事業之基礎與管理之根本。此種制度與步驟如下··</p>
<p>（一）規定組織系統Ｐｌａｎ　ｏｆ　Ｏｒｇａｎｉｚａｔｉｏｎ，自總理起至工人止，其各個之功能，權限與責任，以及彼此相互間之關係，務須一一明白規定，以免在辦事上有誤會與衝突之虞，並避免不負責任及推諉之弊。</p>
<p>（二）規定一種事業之簡單表記及號碼（Ｍｎｅｔｎｏｎｉｃ　Ｃｌａｓｓｉｆｒｃａｔｉｏｎ）以定名稱，而省抄寫之工作。</p>
<p>（三）規定期之報告制度（Ｓｙｓｔｅｍ　ｏｆ　Ｒｅｐｏｒｔｓ），以使經理明悉事業進行之况狀，爲改良之確實根據。</p>
<p>（四）規定會計制度（Ａｃｃｏｏｎｔｉｎｇ　Ｓｙｓｔｅｍ），適合管理之各部份，爲管理之利器。　　（五）規定有標準之活動預算制度（Ｆｌｅｘｂｌｅ　Ｂｅｄｇｅｔａｒｙ　Ｓｙｓｔｅｍ），其標準務須符合生產之標準，以及各部份間接消耗不同之標準。</p>
<p>（六）規定採辦　度（Ｐｕｒｃｈａｓｉｎｇ　Ｓｙｓｔｅｍ），以便符合製造工程及經濟之需要。</p>
<p>（七）規定市塲及推銷之分析制度（Ｍａｋｅｔ　ａｎｄ　Ｓａｌｅｓ　Ａｎａｌｙｓｉｓ），以便啣　推銷之計畫及管理制度。</p>
<p>（八）規定對於生產改良之計畫及管理制度（Ｐｌａｎｎｉｎｇ　＆　Ｃｏｎｔｒｏｌ　ｏｆ　Ｐｒｏｄｕｃｔ）</p>
<p>（九）規定工程方面之計畫管理制度（Ｐｌａｎｎｉｎｇ　＆　Ｃｏｎｔｒｏｌ　ｏｆ　Ｅｎｇｉｎｅｅｒｉｎｇ）</p>
<p>（十）規定機械之標準（Ｓｔａｎｄａｒｄｉｚａｔｉｏｎｏｆ　Ｅｑｕｉｐｍｅｎｔ）</p>
<p>（十一）規定各種材料收發及存儲之制度（Ｓｙｓｔｅｍ　ｆｏｒ　Ｒｅｃｅｉｐｔ，Ｓｔｏｒａｇｅ　＆　Ｄｅｌｉｖｅｒｙ　ｏｆ　Ｍａｔｅｒｉａｌｓ）</p>
<p>（十二）規定製造之計畫及管理制度（Ｐｌａｎｎｉｎｇ　ａｎｄ　Ｃｏｎｔｒｏｌ　ｏｆ　Ｐｒｏｄｕｃｔｉｏｎ），自定貨起到出貨爲止，不論存貨或特製者</p>
<p>（十三）規定機械之修理製度（Ｍａｉｎｔｅｎａｎｃｅ　ｏｆ　Ｐｌａｎｔ），以便檢查及修理，庶免有臨時停頓之損失，及危險之發生。</p>
<p>（十四）規定分級薪工制度（Ｇｒａｄｅｄ　Ｓｃｈｅｄｕｌｅ　ｏｆ　Ｓａｌａｒｉｅｓ　ａｎｄ　Ｗａｇｅｓ）憑工作之性質，緊要及責任而定。</p>
<p>（十五）規定鼓勵花紅制度（Ｉｎｃｅｎｔｉｖｅ　Ｐａｙ），其標準須用動作及時間分析以定之。</p>
<p>（十六）規定職工功過紀綠制度（Ｅｍｐｌｏｙｅｅ　Ｒｅｃｏｒｄ），以便培植人材與升級及加薪等事。</p>
<p>以上所言十六種制度，尤須彼此互相啣接，如同鐘錶之機件，息息相連，否則只有其形式，而不得其精神，即等於虚設矣。因此無論任何國貨工廠欲採納科學管理，須先視其本來之管理程度如何，而加以整理，以樹立根本。然此亦非易事也，即就以上各種制度之規定而言，至少亦需數載之時光，方能就緒。至一工廠原來之管理情形本係凌亂不堪，而一旦驟然欲施行科學管理，以收速效，則實爲難事也。</p>

<p>— 谷園</p>
<p>民衆所用的物品，自產自給，尚無使用外貨的觀念。我們只消看老式商店裏的設備，就可明白。上收下付的帳簿，硯台筆墨，算盤書夾等用具，都是本地風光的土產。但自改革以後，這種陳舊的東西，隨着管理制度變更而廢棄。最能表現這種現象的，要算幾家簇新的銀行了。銀行記帳是新式簿記，因爲横寫且用國際數字的關係，不得不用洋紙。布裝或皮裝的封面，以及與之有連帶關係的鋼筆鉛筆墨水紙張，無一而非洋貨不可。甚至我國特產的算盤，也代以來路貨的計算機。這樣，管理制度，固然是十足的新式了：可是廢置國貨改用洋貨因而增加貿易的入超，却是一個很嚴重的同題。甚至管理制度愈新式，使用的物品愈洋化。所以在某種意義上，管理制度的變態的革新，是很不合算的一件事。其實，當事者也並不是有意要洋化，實在覺得在新式管理制度下，一切用品，自以西式較爲便利。這樣看來，問題還是在我們不能自己制造用具這一點上　　中國人素來散漫成性，舊式的管理，專重（人），有許多大規模的商店，一切辦事手續，全無單證記錄，以憑稽考，習慣相沿，也不覺不便。新式管理，側重（制度）；例如每付一帳，即有一傳票，依次傳遞，使各經辦者簽字負責。又如售出貨品，自下貨至送貨，中間每一手續，有一單證。且單證往往須用鉛筆複寫，國產紙張，質柔易碎，不得不用洋紙。這樣，制度愈周密，使用洋貨也愈多。年來工商界改新管理制度，在時代的意義上，不能不說是進化的現象；但因此而增加銷費洋貨數量的流弊，我們不能否認是中國特有的變態。</p>
<p>我們認爲我國固有的管理制度，散漫鬆弛，决無保存的價值，研究改良，乃爲當務之急。但一切設備，認爲仍有儘量採用國貨的必要。最好把舊式的用具，設法改良，使仍可適用於新式制度，或將新式用具，設法自造；這樣，制度雖新，仍能適應本國的環境，没有流弊。我們希望研究管理制度和提倡國貨的人們加以注意。</p>

<h3 id="c274">國貨事業之新生路 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— 金頌唐</p>
<p>晚近以來，國貨事業之進展，頗有一日千里之勢，誠屬至可樂觀之現象，然一考何以有若是之新趨勢，當歸功於國貨界諸位先知先覺之舊勉圖進，歷盡艱難困苦之相當代價耳。訌觀去年以來，國貨各工廠之力謀團結協調，種種新的結合，確開我國貨前途之新生命。他日發揚光大，當依此爲鵠的也。兹再分别陳之，爲我新興生產工廠告。</p>
<p>產銷合作協會的設置　實爲生產界與販賣商互助之開始，且爲解决民生問題之基本工作，努力物產建設的唯一捷徑，防止舶來進攻的最强利器，負此重大使命的產銷合作協會，一面已集國内英才濟濟於一堂，苦思焦慮，研究若何杜塞舶來，如何推廣國產，一面注意改良產品，力求物質形式之進步，聚精會神，每次集會，往往費半日之韶光，仍娓娓不倦也。</p>
<p>中國國貨公司之成立　產銷協會鑒於國内有數之大公司小商店，莫不以舶來炫耀，撩人耳目，他們都以爲國貨不易推銷，利益枯薄爲口頭禪，目光短淺，殊難覺醒也，乃有純粹完美的中國國貨公司之組織。聚全國精華於一堂，以副民衆之期望，草創伊始，營業已能蒸蒸日上，足徵以前國人愛國有心，購買無地之苦。我們希望市民服用國貨，須痛下决心，扶植此新興的國貨事業，更希望國貨公司之服務人員，一方雖注意生產界的出品，還希望顧到消費者的需要，所以中國國貨公司在國貨運動史上，實屬一頁有價值的記載也，是產銷合作協會第一幕的成功。</p>
<p>國貨介紹所之計劃　產銷協會在萬國矚目之上海，已有一相當局面之經濟壁壘，理想促進效力，深入各地計，因有各地國貨介紹所之設，而以上海總所集其成。所抱任務，以生產品經介紹而遍佈於各地市塲，調查消費情况，羅列國貨樣品，務達國人認識國貨，辨别國貨，採購標準，使生產者無待沽之苦，銷售者省選擇之煩。各地商人，得一如是健全的機關，省却許多麻煩及時間與精神，這可說產銷合作協會所負的使命　　流動推銷團之動機　產銷合作協會，對於大都市之設立國貨公司，各地之分設國貨介紹所，可謂思想週到，逐步次第進行，已盡十二分之能事矣。然歷年以來，輒見外人之推銷手段與官傳政策之雷厲風行，每由都會而市鎭，由市鎭而村落，雖窮鄕僻壤，亦已達到，可謂無微不至，無遠不屆。回顧國人僅知着眼於通都大邑，而忽視僻壤之區，坐見鄕鎭村落大好市塲，悉被外人勢力侵佔無遺，實爲國產前途障碍之一大原因。故有流動推銷團之動機，以耐勞任苦的人員，分僱船隻遊行各地，到處宣傳，隨意銷貨，使鄕姑村女，亦得一見國貨之眞而目，法至善也。</p>
<p>以上所述，確爲中華產銷合作協會一年來之新貢獻，即所以謀國貨工廠事業之穩固與進步，故欲求進步，端賴集合同志，團結精神，共謀建立健全之基礎，力求健全之設施，用副各方屬望之</p>

<p>其他各個内部之整頓與充實，益當奮勉有加，更希望新興工廠急應互通聲氣，各地民衆羣策羣力以赴之，利人利己，總以團結集中爲要素，不難同登光明之路，救國之道，庶乎近之。</p>
<h3 id="c275">國貨運動應有的助力 <a href="#c275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— 白雪女士</p>
<p>國貨運動在表面上看起來，似乎已經到了相當具體相當成功的時期了，大工廠和大國貨公司都紛紛興起，已屢見不鮮了。但是我們考察其實際，還覺得在萌芽期間。像製造國貨的工具，就是製造物件的物件丨機械，大都要靠外國供給。有些原料（像最細的細紗人造絲等）也有是購自外洋者。工商業的管理制度也都是免强効法外國的皮毛，能否適合我們的國貨運動的環境與需要，還是一個值得討論的問題。</p>
<p>國貨運動應當實事求是，適合民族的需要；不可專事洋化，因爲這樣也許會阻礙國貨運動的前進。</p>
<p>然則什麽是國貨運動的助力呢？</p>
<p>（一）科學生助力　二十世紀是科學的時代，没有科學的國家，必定要漸漸衰滅，以致民族淪亡。試看我們中國，科學等於零，大規模的事業（像電氣工程化學工程製造機械等）没有一樣不要仰給於外國；所以國貨運動首先要培養偉大的科學家，發明並創造一切機械，化學等大工程。這樣，國貨運動才能成功，中華民族才有國貨的國家。</p>
<p>（二）政府的助力　政府的助力除培養及奬勵科學家外，還要幫助及建設大工業，應當把全國通盤計劃，怎樣抵制外貨？怎樣使國貨運動成功，造成一個完全國貨的國家？怎樣能夠把國貨推銷到國外去？···這都是政府的責任丨</p>
<p>（三）民衆的助力　如今我們已被帝國主義壓迫得透不過氣來了，而一部份民衆們依舊替洋貨推銷，而置國貨於不顧，這是自取滅亡的途徑丨所以民衆應當覺悟起來，個個不買洋貨，完全服用國貨，使中國人製造的國貨，中國人自己來享用。</p>
<p>以上三者是聯帶關係的，不能分開單獨進行；要三者同時合一的向前進展。</p>

<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>（模仿是中國人的惡習！）這一句話，友邦人士，常常這樣譏笑着我們。就是我們中國人自己，也常常這樣互笑着，竊論着。</p>
<p>在知道：（模仿）二字，是最不妥當的字眼，祗要你是模仿，就無論什麽事都不會成功。因爲充其量，不過是模仿罷了！</p>
<p>萌芽時代的國貨界，犯着這（模仿）二字的毛病，雖然不能說是多數，可是以我的目光來觀察，倒不在少數呢！這也有個原因，我深深地能夠知道。外國貨每有一樣來華的時候，行在上海流行着，慢慢地内地也有了。到了内地也有的時候，也可說某種外貨普遍的時候，我們的國貨的製造者，那纔模仿着的把那某種出品來問世。那時候，我們中國人，某種外貨，已經是用慣了，就是國貨的模仿品，如保的相像，如何的牢固，他們是不會有需要的時候，同是眼光深刻一些的人，似乎也不會來光顧。要知道這個並不是中國人不信任中國貨，實在是中國的國貨製造者，太蔑視了自己，而爲外人作牛馬的原故。以至有些資本短小的國貨廠商，每因一二種的模仿外貨的出品，得不到（銷數驚人，）而半途停止。這種情形，已是數見不鮮了。</p>
<p>我以爲要不蹈覆轍，必先要聘定專</p>
<p>門人才，着意於（創造。）</p>
<p>（創造）的出品，定能使我們中國人的贊同。試一看某一種外國貨的來華，一定是見所未見的，所以好奇的中國人，你也買，我也買，於是外貨的出品者，一舉而成效大見，迅速地一批一批的進口，而我們中國人，也不惜以大好的國寳，整千整萬的去孝敬外國人。</p>
<p>别的不舉，把ＸＸ電筒來說，當他初次來華的時候，不過上海人去買來用用，現在呢，窮鄕僻壤之間，差不多是十人之中，祗少一人有一個了。中國人雖然模仿，出品者也不至一家，可是模仿白模仿，那外貨的銷路，依然不弱於前呢！</p>
<p>從這個小小的電策着想起，我們中國的出品者，如其再專事模仿，這樣地因循下去，而不再在（創造）一方面去着想，我看祗有退化的現實而没有進展的可能！</p>
<p>喜歡模仿而没有成效的國貨出品者啊！這是我的忠告，千萬不要把他怱促地看過。假如實行我的話，在今後革除了模仿實方創造，把出品製造得絶端的摩登化，這是我可操左券的，你的出品定能迎合國人的心理，那時眞個能達到：（銷數驚人）呢！但是你不要忘了這最後的幾句話！</p>
<p>（一）初次出品，有不妥的地方，須請求購用者的意見，加以改良。</p>
<p>（二）出品要始終如一，祗有改進而不得退化。</p>
<p>（三）假如原料因時價關係，成本加重，也不得故意抬高定價，因爲可以相互牽匀。</p>
<p>（四）廣告是輔助出品的推銷，不可把他輕視，必要請一個專門人才担任。</p>

<p>— 英</p>
<p>（一）當前危機　中國國貨工廠，向極幼稚，當此經濟戰爭短兵相接白刃相加之時，我國貨工廠，宜如何悉心將護，加意栽培，使此方茁壯芽，蔚爲喬木，徒以平時聯絡未盡得法，仇貨乘之，施其縱横　　之術，用其挑撥離間之計，而我國貨工廠盡墮彀中，猜忌之心生，傾軋之風起，遂不惜競事跌價以相號召，濫放貨賬以廣招徠，運閥内戰未已，國貨内戰又生，相持無已，不數年而人將索我枯魚之肆矣。</p>
<p>（二）救濟方法　國貨危機，已迫眉睫，欲謀救濟，首當立起自責，共圖聯合，顧聯合云者，不尚空談而重實際，不尚形式而貴精神，聯合販賣，前此已有行之者，短長之效，大略可見，爲今之計，惟有更進一步爲最澈底之聯合，泯除畛域，合爲一家，對外營業彼此一幟，觀聽旣一，氣象自新，每種國貨工廠，各擇信譽較優之牌號利用之，以收事半功倍之效，各廠資產公平估計，就其定值，各給股票，戰陣旣一，軍容自振，故障旣去，清明自來。</p>
<p>（三）經營方策　經營工業槪貴出品精美，尤貴供求相應，因地制宜，設立分廠，星羅棋布，聲氣相能，出品推銷，各就近地，運費旣省，成本以輕，較之麕集一隅，陳貨山積，陸運海航，動需經月，乘時趨利，我無能爲者，相去奚啻天壤。</p>
<p>（四）利益預測　同業聯合，實力自雄，仇貨來侵，足以一戰，一利也。同業聯合放賬，至少年每年利息，數至可觀，二利也。零星購買原料，索值較巨，自經聯合，可以躉購八折計算，獲利非細，三利也。同業各廠彼此分立，機械設備，俱不經濟，自經聯合，諸弊悉除四利也。各廠職工，每易流動，自經聯合，心思專一，而訓練易成，五利也。</p>
<p>同業工廠實行聯合，織綢工業，已見其端，其他各廠，或多懷疑，用述大槪，藉當鼓吹。</p>

<p>— 陳森甫</p>
<p>今下走介紹雪恥布之前，先叙述其起因與發源：南通因農產品以棉爲大宗，故鄕人多以織布爲唯一副業，其布色澤潔白，質地耐牢，因此宿著聲名，其最大市塲爲關東數省，所以通城之布莊，亦名關莊。自九一八日宼侵陷東北：銷路一落知丈，及僞國成立，關稅自主，對於通布稅率，加高三倍以上，以故銷路絶跡。若長此無所着想，南通各織户之生計，豈非盡絶乎？然各織户並不因此挫折而自餒，乃多數將舊有織機，自動加寛，改織闊門面之平紋色布，尤能精心研究，更得各布號積極提倡，一時遂風起雲湧，經過迭次之研討，致有今日之成績。取名雪恥以示誓雪國恥之意。此布原料係大生紗廠出品之二十支紗，此紗爲通花所紡，考通花之之纎維長度有十六分之十五英吋强，堪紡卅二支紗。現大生正在添辦漂染廠，擬將紡出之紗用科學方法染成色紗，專售給織雪恥布之用，以期顏色鮮明，品質一致。此項布疋規定長度（舊制度量）七丈五尺，重量五斤十兩左右，門面二尺二寸，價值四元六七角，業已行銷於大江南北及浙之嘉湖等處，即閩粤之厦門汕頭亦有大批定貨，現日須運出一二千疋。近聞躉批之貨，統由大生紗廠整理裝包出運，故該廠批發所亦有躉批出售，並聞其滬事務所亦可定批。下走因此布爲純粹國貨，且命名頗足激勵人心，特草此篇，以作介紹。</p>
<h3 id="c279">華商紗廠减工 <a href="#c279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— 周成勛</p>
<p>最近一星期來，本埠實業界爆發了一件劇烈的事：就是一年以來的華商紗廠雖在極度掙扎的狀態之下，依舊站不穩脚跟而宣告減工　　减工的理由：是因爲營業慘敗，生產過剩，强受外貨傾銷的影響，不得不出此節制生產苟延殘喘的下策，在紗廠本身說來，這減工舉動，仍不失爲眼前鬆動緩謀蘇復的辦法，但這種絶對消極的矛盾的空前現象，終究是國產事業史上黯淡的一頁。</p>
<p>紗業中人云，華紗較外紗，價旣居昻，質又大遜，眼下這種不景氣的事實，眞是中國人不求改進事事落後的一個引證。不單是紗業如此，其他實業也是如此，事後憑政府派員來洽商援助，實在無補實際，根本問題，還全在生產者本身的自决自覺。</p>
<p>實行減工，這僅僅是短期過渡的階梯，决不能診救紗業積弱的沉閜，甚至天天餉奸商以炸彈，也决不能硬拉回他們專販仇貨唯利是圖的獸性，華紗能夠迅速地下一番苦工，减低本錢，精良品質，外貨傾銷乏力，生產决不過剩，到那時恐惶運增工也來不及了，那裏再會減工？</p>
<p>希望最近的將來，紗業能夠展啓一個新興的局面。</p>

<p>是根據兩大觀點：（一）葉氏昆仲，對於國貨開發，確有切實的供獻，最明顯的，有以嫦娥牌牙粉，肅清傾銷全國的仇貨金剛石牙粉的殘跡。（二）袞袞諸公，萬貫商人，其中頗不乏有幸運造成之業，而永和實業公司，則爲葉氏昆仲，白手成功，着工人粗服，日夜操作的最後結晶</p>
<p>記者且公開一曲線重重的故事，追叙他們的幼年生活，從此，讀者也能確信，因苦環境，便是將來的生機，只在你能化阻力爲助力，那末，痛苦就能轉移爲幸福了。</p>
<p>鍾廷先生江陰青暘鎭人，父親業米，也是清苦的人。某一個的新年，鍾廷君還很小，得了一角小洋的壓歲錢，他那裏肯化費，連忙珍藏起來，約模又過半年，合家忽爲買物問題而躊蹰，他就掬出他唯一的私蓄。這豈是普通孩子們所能辦到。</p>
<p>最初來上海習業，簡直是學習娘姨，淘米燒飯拘小孩，無事不做，他狠能忍耐過去，毫無怨言，三年期滿，升爲跑街，心地老實，作事負責，所以生意拉攏，也特别的多。有一位尊長，不願湮滅他的長才，供給他數百元資本，力勸他獨創事業，他那時正目擊日本化妝品，獨占我國市塲，就開辦一小規模的家庭工業，取名永和，大槪是（世世永和，共紹大業）的意思。然而，我們也可以想像到當時的昆仲妯娌，已足含括僱主和僱工的兩大階級了。</p>
<p>吉廷各，起初在江蘇三師畢業，後來小手業已變爲小工塲局面，經濟有了辦法，并且希望在化妝品界，獨樹一幟，終於留學德國，得化學博士學位，現在行銷全國的永美霜，撲同粉，就是他多年試騐的成績。祥廷君更其精明强幹，樸實耐勞，假設我們參觀他們的工廠，簡直看不出他是手創永和的一員。</p>
<p>記者更欲在他們的私德方面，略述一二，這確是現代暴發户的唯一針灸，他們對待業師，眞是惟恭惟敬，每節送禮，或加訪問，絲毫没有得意忘形的惡習，此次工廠失火，被難工友的恤金，也比較其他工廠增加一倍，厚棺豐殮，體貼工人無微不至。</p>

<p>途哲民是一個很漂亮的富人之子，整天在優閑而舒適的環境裏沉醉着，雖然現在已到了中華民國的生死關頭，每個人都在担心着要做亡國奴了，可是他却依舊鎭靜得像與中華民無關的法蘭西人，意大利人一樣，盡量的消受着他父親所獻給他的一切物質上底供應；他夫人丨柳珊女士丨倒是一個思想很高尚的新女子，常把她自己的錢去捐助義勇軍，很關心地注意着前方的戰訊。</p>
<p>（我打算去做一套新衣服）。某一天的午後，這一對志趣各别的賢伉儷，在南京路上一家飮食店裏吃過了點心退出來，正沿着人行道在慢慢地散步，哲民忽然看見有一家洋服店的櫉窗裏，掛着一疋極精美的細呢，便有意要定制一套新的洋服。</p>
<p>柳珊對於他這個主張，並不表示可否，便隨着他走進店去。</p>
<p>（好！就給我裁一套吧！）質地輕，顏色好，余大少爺已經是心滿意足了，也不再向伙計請問價格，便準備付定洋了。</p>
<p>夥計堆着一臉的笑，用一盤皮帶尺給他很小心地量算尺寸，突然，余大少爺想到了一個疑問：</p>
<p>（這是中國貨嗎）？</p>
<p>（是的，東西比洋貨好，價錢比洋貨巧，先生，包你滿意）！夥計很眞誠地答復着。</p>
<p>（啊！中國貨嗎？靠不住！靠不住！一穿就皺，我不要了！）哲民把已經掏出來的鈔票，又藏回了衣袋裏去，表示决意不要了！</p>
<p>（但是，先生，你没有試過，怎麽知道呢）？夥計竭力挽勸着。</p>
<p>（不用試，一定會皺！中國貨有什麽好貨）！哲民極武斷的批評。同時，同時，他已挽了柳珊的手臂，打算要走了。</p>
<p>（哲民，我請問你姓什麽）？柳女士突然發出了這個奇怪的問題來。</p>
<p>（我當然姓余）！</p>
<p>（姓余嗎？余是中國人的性啊！你爲什麽換上一個（華盛頓）（羅斯福）的姓呢）？</p>
<p>柳女士的銳利的文駁，已使哲民窘得臉都紅了，夥計們却在很得意地笑着。</p>
<p>（姓余嗎？你是中國人啊！你爲什麽不愛中國貨呢？你爲什麽毫無理由的厭惡中國貨呢，可憐的亡國奴坯子）！柳女士是恨極了，她覺得哲民今天的舉動，已很顯著地證明他對於自己平日所作的種種勸告確無接受的誠意；不禁無限硽憤，駡了幾句，便獨自氣冲冲地走了　　第二天，柳女士便極堅决地和余大少爺辦妥了離婚的手續，隻身北上，投入戰地救護隊的隊伍中去了。</p>

<h3 id="c283">國農村去！ <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>我和玄，楊幸之兩先生的意見稍有不同，我是褊袒（回農村去）的。</p>
<p>中國現在有三種方式的農村（甲）河南陜西一帶的農村，早已成爲（無農之村）；縣長勒令種烟，交不出烟捐便打屁股。城裏公子少爺吃茄力克香烟，鄕下大姑娘没有褲子穿。這種（無農之村）當然無從回去。（乙）江浙湘皖一帶的農村，有大地主，有佃農；資本主義吃大地主，大地主再吃佃農；這種臨於潰滅的農村，也還無法回去。但是中國還有第三種農村｜（丙）自耕農爲中心的農村。即如我的家鄕｜錢塘江上流的鄕村，絶少萬金以上的富户，自耕農佔十分之八。並不是世外桃源，英雄大有用武之地，我們若能回去，絶對不會失望的。</p>
<p>回到鄕村去做什麽呢？我們去組織自耕農作自衛戰。目前資本主義把甲種農村的精液已經吸乾，乙種農村也没有甜頭可得，惟有丙種農村被他們看作肥肉，其欲逐逐。若是農業電氣化這類新名詞成爲他們踏進農村的手段，自耕農將立刻踏在他們的脚底。我們要帮助自耕農，組成强有力的團體，以集體農團來實現農業電氣化；我們使自耕農能保持自己的器械，則資本主義即失去抓奪的機會。機運一轉，乙種農村也有轉機的希望。</p>
<p>新社會的建立，不論用什麽過程，破壞以後，必須繼之以建設。替丙種農村增中實力，即是替農村經濟奠了基石；從飢荒中逃過來的新社會，其社會秩序方能恢復得快，所以爲自耕農作自衛戰，即是爲新社會作自衛戰。且看消費協作社在蘇俄革命進程所盡的力，我們不能看輕丙種農村的力量。</p>
<p>丙種農村當然也有紳士痞棍之類，那是容易對付的。紳士痞棍要假虎威而後行，對於自耕農没有直接約束的力量，我們和自耕農站在一起，即不鬭爭也可以取勝了。</p>
<p>最後，我也說兩句近於口號的話：（我們回農村去！我們帮助自耕農去！）</p>
<h3 id="c284">三子的爸爸 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>三子一張開眼睛，看見他爸爸剛從床上爬起，手裏拉着一根褲帶，上半身還是光光的，那件藍布褂子圍在蓆子上面。他不知道爸爸昨夜是什麽時候回來的。他每天一倒在床上立刻就睡去，不到天亮也不會醒來。三子揉了揉眼，跟着也下了床。</p>
<p>（這個，你今兒帶出去，貼在牆壁上，丢在街上，或者人家的屋子裏都好。）爸從蓆子底下拿了一疊印着字的紙。　　（爸，這就是你說過的，你們自己做的什麽報嗎？）</p>
<p>（不是，你放在籃裏油紙下面，好好的不要給陌生人看見。）</p>
<p>三子提着燒餅油條的籃子，走到火車站那邊的空地，五六個孩子已經比他先到了。他們每天在這地方聚會的。那五六個孩子都没有家，有的因爲爸爸在工廠裏給機器軋死了，有的大熱天拉車在路上倒斃了，娘没法活下去，就抛了孩子逃走，有的就尋死了。三子走近了他們，把籃裏那張油紙揭起了一角，把他爸爸的話告訴了們們，就每人分給了一點。</p>
<p>（三子，我們告訴你一件事，）阿狗悄悄地說，裝一個鬼臉。（前天說的那個大洋房裏張老闆的兒子，我們打算在手裏。）</p>
<p>一個個小黑臉子上都閃着光，便四散了。三子提着籃子走得最慢，他在心裏巴望爸爸再有這種事敎他幹，他有許多同伴，一定會幹得很好的。</p>
<p>今天三子眞高興，爸爸要他幹的事，眞的幹得很好。並且太陽還没有到那個大牆壁上天天吸着烟的那個男子的脚，他一籃燒餅和油條就賣完了。算起來，也比平日少走了好多路，那火燙的太陽他是最恨的。</p>
<p>滿心歡喜地，跨着大步拐一個彎，不防一輛黄包車很快的撞過來，他來不及躱避，那車輪早把他的脚趾碾痛了。他正要駡出口，却聽得說：（三子，幹嗎要跑得這麽急急的？）他一聽聲音就知道這拉車的也是他的同伴小二。他忙轉過頭去看，眞的没有錯，那車子上坐着一個漂亮的女人，女人手裏還擎着一頂怪好看的小傘。他看看小二的背影，覺馛自己賣燒餅還比他有福氣多了。</p>
<p>他這麽高興着回到了家。可是這一天地爸爸没有回來。第二天早上一張眼，房裏也只有他一個。他去問隔壁小七子的爸爸，這滿臉黑痣的人告訴他，說他爸爸已經給捕房抓去了。</p>
<p>三子的爸爸從此就再不回來了。</p>
<h3 id="c285">吃刀飯的人 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 李</p>
<p>金華人除了黨，敎，官，農，工，商，學，兵等八流以外，還有（吃刀飯）的一種特等營生。（吃刀飯）的都是好漢，吃好的，穿好的，捻香灰，拜巴子，都有一羣英雄做同路。這些英雄好漢，居民順之者昌，逆之者亡。從前（吃刀飯）的，第一須殺人不眨眼。第二須被殺不討饒。最重要的條件是和人生氣，抽出雪白的刀來削下自己身上一大塊肉，不縐一縐眉，不抹一抹血，不哼半個痛字。這樣，（吃刀飯）的資格旣備，便可任意横行，到死受人敬仰。可是近年來這樣的好漢已不多見了。</p>
<p>如今的好漢雖然殺人一般不眨眼，但割下自己的肉的蠢事却决不做，並且一旦將被殺，也决不不討饒。如今（吃刀飯）的終南捷徑，第一須拼命巴結頭目。第二須對比自己弱的逞威風，對比自己强</p>
<p>的賠小心。這兩個條件做到了，於是投個豪紳，五十元八十元的賞賜之下，替他去殺無財無勇而又不幸冒犯了豪紳的笨人。</p>
<p>據說：能十刀八刀，致人殘廢，使欲生不得求死不能的受上賞。在刀五刀殺得人口不能聲，手不能動，輾轉血泊，三數日而後氣絶的次之。若白刀進，紅刀出，人便氣絶，死得痛痛快快的最下。</p>
<p>重金錢，薄友誼，（吃刀飯）的人雖爲無產階級，然而他們的主人是有錢的，而且他們的意識也和有產階級的一樣，頂討厭窮人，所以他們不會反動。</p>
<p>吃刀飯的人對於一班豪紳是狠有用處的。所以他們是英雄。</p>

<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>丨給我的哥哥丨</p>
<p>你的車七鐘開，我不到六點三刻就離開了月臺，我並不是害怕趕不上浦口渡輪，那小火輪要到七點二十分纔開的。你也許注意到了罷，臨行時我只和你鬆鬆地握了握手，淡淡地笑了一下就轉身走了，我不曾回頭再看你一眼。可是出了車站我却不肯走向江邊，我和惠一起在那長廊上慢步走着，我們往返地走了好幾次，我們彼此都不說話。突然火車放汽聲尖銳地衝進了我的耳裏，車輪駛動的聲音又接着響了起來。我知道你開始往北方走了。我的眼前糢糊地現了你的瘦臉，我的心隱隱地痛楚起來。我没有流淚，但我的聲音已經有些啞了。</p>
<p>（走罷），惠在催促，他的聲音也和我的一樣。我們就這樣離開了浦口。於是這十天來的生活就完全消失在後面，我彷彿從一個長夢中醒了過來。</p>
<p>你是回到天津去了。你還没有上車的時候，别人都說那地方有些危險，勸你不要回那里去，我却没有說一句勸阻的話。並不是我不知道這幾天來所謂抗日軍事的變化，並不是我不顧念到你的安全。但我更知道一件事情：你和我一樣，你也是一個註定了在危險困苦中掙扎的人，你也没有偷安的機會和權利。生活的負擔壓在你的青年的肩頭上，八十元一月的薪水就買去了你的全部光陰，你没有一點思想的自由，你更没有一點行動的自由。從這十天來的談話中我已經了解你的平淡而苦痛的生活的全部了。</p>
<p>自然你前年也有過兩次的經騐。你自己决不會不知道你去的那地方在很短時間内就會改變了顏色，也許你在那里甚至會被人强迫着把你改變了國籍。但你有什麽辦法呢？人家在長期抵抗的名義下打破了失地的紀錄，人家在裝運字畫出洋，人家在搬運古物，人家在向你徵收航空捐，人家天天在報紙上宣布戰勝的消息，人家在提倡（航空救國），（跳舞救國），（娱樂救國），（戀愛救國），人家服務黨國之暇，在賭博玩妓，人家：：：，你却不得不爲了八十元的月薪回到那就要被囗囗放棄的地方了。</p>
<p>（這又有什麽辦法呢）？你微笑地說出來的這句話裏一定藏得有很大的悲哀。當你想到上面的那些事情的時候，你的心會因悲憤而痛楚罷，但是你如果再一思索，想到在那一帶的地方還有被長期抵抗的諸公忘掉了的千千萬萬的民衆在槍砲炸彈下面呻吟掙扎，你也許會覺得你自己的命運倒不是怎樣可悲的了，你也許還會捨棄你的平淡的，苦痛的生活而投身在他們中間爲他們做一點事情罷。我想你是會這樣做的，因爲我看出來，在談到那千千萬萬的民衆在鐵蹄下面呻吟掙扎的時候，你的被生活摧毁了的面容忽然發了光，你的疲倦的身子忽然充滿了生氣。我知道如今還有什麽東西可以鼓動你的衰弱的心。但是我怕，我怕再一個大的打擊就會把你整個地打碎了。（未完）</p>

<p>— Ｊｕｌｅｓ　Ｒｅｎａｒｄ作　林取譯</p>
<p>尿鉢（一）</p>
<p>在床上闖下禍事，旣然不止一次，於是紅蘿蔔鬚便每晚很留心地從事預防。在夏天，這是很容易的。九點鐘時候，當雷辟克家的打發紅蘿蔔鬚去睡時，他便心甘情願地到外面去一轉；而這一晚便得发然無事地過去。</p>
<p>在冬天，這種散步却成爲一種苦役。天剛黑，他去關鷄的時候，雖然做過第一次的預防功夫，可是這是没有支持到第二天早上的可能的。吃完晚餐，再閑坐一會，已經是九點鐘了，天已黑了很久，而這黑夜還要無窮盡地一直延長下去。紅蘿蔔鬚自非有第二次的預防功夫不可。</p>
<p>這天晚上，正同以前許多夜晚一樣，他在考慮着。</p>
<p>（我有需要嗎？）他在想；（還是没有需要呢？）</p>
<p>通常或則因爲確實没有退縮的餘地，或則因爲輝的月光鼓起了他的勇氣，他總是回答（有的）。偶然雷辟克和大哥斐利克斯也做着榜樣給他者。而且他的需要並不每次强制他遠離住宅，跑到幾乎是在曠野的道路旁的溝渠那邊去。平常他多半是停立在樓梯下面；這是要看他的需要情形而定。</p>
<p>可是今天晚上，繁密的雨點篩着玻璃窗，風已吹熄了星光，胡桃樹在牧塲上呼呼怒吼。</p>
<p>（這並不覺得怎樣，）紅蘿蔔鬚從容考慮了一番之後，這樣下着結論，（我没有需要。）</p>
<p>他和大家道過晚安之後，點了一支蠟燭，跑到走廊盡頭右邊他那間四壁蕭然的孤寂的房内去。他脫下衣服，睡在床上等街雷辟克家的進來查看。她祇一下便給他把被窩塞緊，把燭吹滅。她把蠟燭留給他，却不留下一根火柴。於是她把他關在房内，在外面用鑰匙把門鎖了。丨丨這是因爲他害怕的綠故。紅蘿蔔鬚起初玩味着屋内祇有自己一個人的那種樂趣。他高興在黑暗中思想。他回憶起日間的種種，他慶幸自己安然地逃過囝許多難關，他希望明天再得着同樣的幸運。他希望接連兩天，雷辟克家的不會注意到他身上來，於是他想帶着這幻夢安然入睡。</p>
<p>他剛剛合眼，便感到一種經歷過的不快。</p>
<p>（這是早就逃避不了的，）紅蘿蔔鬚暗想。</p>
<p>在别的人這時便會爬起來。可是紅蘿蔔鬚知道床底下没有尿鉢。雷辟克家的雖然會賭咒否認，可是她却老是忘記給他一個尿鉢。并且紅蘿蔔鬚旣已從事預防，這尿鉢又有什麽用處呢？</p>
<p>於是紅蘿蔔鬚在本當起床的當兒，却又推想着。</p>
<p>（遲早我總師要讓步的，）他心裏想。（我越忍耐，我便積蓄得越多。可是如果我現在馬上解出來的話，我不過解出一點點，我的被窩還有時間給我的體温烘乾的。根據經騐，我决信媽媽一點也不會看出來的。）</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚把他的不快緩和下去了，他非常安寗的得又閉上眼睛，開始熟睡。</p>

<p>日軍侵熱以來，似乎又是舉國驚惶，（請纓抗日）（决心抵抗）之類的通電固然忙得一塌糊塗，尤其是達官貴人們的東逃西竄，更是忙得滿頭是汗，最近熱河總算又是完全了結，本可以（告一段落），偏生日帝國主義還不滿足，由於北平搬走了古董國粹之後，又來請古書逃難的一點上看來，便知道平津確是危急，在最有成效的（一貫政策）之下，大槪也是靠不大住的，於是帝國主義御用之擴音機的士大夫而兼博士之流，又不能不誠惶恐的忙將起來，甚而至於公然發表所謂（不過如此）的一（意見）。</p>
<p>關於這位博士，我們知道得確是非常清楚的，（前年十一月曾主張政府當局應該接受日本政府在國聯提出的五個基本原則，開始交涉），又於（去年六月曾作文主張政府表示願意依據上述五項原則，進行與日交涉），現在又一再聲明：（我深信，對日交涉無論取何種方式，必須不違背國聯在今年二月二十四日的大會上通過的報告書與建議案的原則）。這裏眞是說得最爲明白，簡單一句話，就是說除了應當心悅誠服的和日帝國主義（直接交涉）之外，則無他法。而且更不可（冐死拚命作戰），所以他說（我不能昩着我的良心出來主張作戰）。</p>
<p>當然，這種（意見）在目前（戰略）而後（誘敵），而後（退守），而後（準備反攻）的情形之下，很是可以邀功的，假如果然中意了有道明君，少不了是官居大宰。帝宏才濟世，覆雨翻雲，海晏河清，普天同慶。</p>
<p>然而最可惜的是（擴大民族革命戰爭）已成了全國最有力的論調，廣大的羣衆都國識了祇有革命戰爭才是中華民族唯一的出路，唯有像他一羣的高等華人才會這樣的委曲求全，摇尾乞憐的舐着主人的唾沫。天然，那些誓死抵抗的英雄們，到底不敢馬上掩旗息鼓，至少在報紙上總還要堂皇其詞的（與敵周旋）。所以此公的說法，少不了爲人們所掩鼻而不敢聞。</p>
<p>那末，他爲什麽要這樣的大放厥詞呢？一句話，唯恐中國不亡。</p>
<p>唉唉！此所謂（國之將亡必有妖孽）也歟？</p>

<p>— 文</p>
<p>｜洗不了人間的污漬｜</p>
<p>在滬北，一條滿散着垃圾，溺臭剌鼻了弄堂殿尾的小房間，便是洗衣婦辛苦掙扎的所在。</p>
<p>每早，遠處嗚嗚傳來的工廠汽笛聲，是她的準確的時計，工作開始的信號，從門角裏提出先晚打好了肥皂的大鉛桶衣裳，放近自來水管，轉身才再把衣扣扭扭好，兩手辭抓着蓬得像麻雀窠似的花白頭髮，再提起另一隻鉛桶，踏着落寞的晨曦，到弄口的老虎灶泡開水，昔年，連這幾枚開水錢都捨不得，只須把衣裳隔時浸在冷水裏，然後略略擦上一些肥皂，把衣刷用勁一刷也就乾凈了，可是現在這氣力是没有了，只有用開水冲。</p>
<p>等到太陽升上，弄口有了菜販的呌喊，糞車已在石砌的馬路上咚咚價響的時候，她便一走一歇的提了兩桶色質不齊的衣裳，到弄外右邊的空坪裏去搭曬，搭曬停當了，頭腦一暈，在她左右前後的房屋，便好像在旋轉，於是她便右手抹住額角，慢慢兒坐上一塊木方，深深的抽轉兩口氣，才有力仰觀天空，看有不有雨象的雲翳，每次下雨了，她總是慌脚慌手的來不及收拾，害得跌交，有時她帶了破衣裳，就便綴補，自從有一天陡下驟雨，把老光眼鏡跌破了以後，她也就不得不停止這綴補的附帶工作。</p>
<p>到了下午，臨晚以前，把衣裳收回去，細心的折疊好，排清主子，她的皺得像鷄皮似了的臉孔，總會現出一些辛苦的笑容，總算又完畢了一天的工作，減少了人生的一段旅程，她用了土黄色的包頭，端端的包好，挾着彳亍的走出門，走出弄堂，上門去分送，人家拿過去仔細一看，喝她一聲一好，洗得還算乾凈！）她接着便是這麽一句：（還有洗麽？就便好帶去！）不分質料的好歹，凡屬衣褲，都取七枚一件，襪子，枕頭套，背心之類則是每件三枚，只要不是算錯了，她從不會爭嚷，她兩眼放着安分的光芒，伸手微顫着領錢，錢到了手，便是一聲：（謝謝！）</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>時局冬令，天氣驟寒，誰都有些瑟縮，衣裳也就更換得稀少了，而她却還是一樣期望操作，只是略略頸頸項有點縮，當她沿門喚收　衣的時候，</p>
<p>在問談時，或者有人問她爲什麽這樣不怕冷，這樣耐得勞苦，便可聽到她這樣的回答：（家鄕的飢荒把我驅來這兒？人家說這兒是天堂，而我却是一樣的要挨餒，到了這時候，（冬天）便眞的中有北風喝了！夫主拉黄包車，也只了得住他一己的嘴巴，眞的，窮人只有喝北風的份兒呵！唉！）</p>
<p>事實上果然有些像，冬天臨了誰都有些瑟縮，衣裳也就更換得稀少了，好像有這麽一個意思：</p>

<p>（謎）是高鼻子給咱們中國人的一個尊號。大槪他們以爲中國的民族性，中國人做的事情，多和他們不同，或超乎理智常情之外，因此他們對中國人的觀察，也莫明其妙，而這一（謎）的尊號也就成爲高鼻子們嘲笑的好材料了。</p>
<p>的確，中國人的事情是有些不可捉摸的。譬如：本來是精神團結，共赴國難，而自己徧徧大演其全武行。前線上血肉横飛，而後方却來個跳舞救國。今天通電殺敵，而明日却悄悄的一溜烟。說得越嚮亮，花樣也就越多，光怪陸離，自家也不免感覺滑稽。即高鼻子見之，也許將喊一聲：孺子滑之尤者也，老子的眼睛也看花了啊！</p>
<p>可是，東洋人畢竟聰明，他猜透解謎的秘訣是大砲，於是久爲人所不了解</p>

<p>最近，神秘的葫蘆似乎在隱約地放出一些幽細的聲息，好像說：灤東難陷，於大局尚無妨碍，何况勝負乃兵家常事，逆來順受，不妨持之以靜，雖未見歡於敵人，然長者揖讓之風固早播揚於天下也。</p>
<p>於是更進而誡曰：狄人侵邠，太王遷岐，强而不抗，古有明訓。彼以剛，我以柔，彼以動，我以靜；坐待十年，三島地震，東京革命，幸運之來，最後勝利舍我其誰屬哉！</p>

<p>編者先生；</p>
<p>每見先生在貴報上解釋店員們的疑問，不覺使我幾月來所積下的憂鬱，湧躍在心頭；所以我不揣冒昩的，來請求先生指敎：</p>
<p>我是本埠某公司裏的一個小職員，每月收入尚豐。五年前（十六歲），由家中的主意，並經我本人同意，與陳女士訂婚。陳亦曾經同我相見過幾次；雙方的性情，同家境等，亦頗相當。不料在訂婚的那年，我因爲受了家中繼母的烏氣，同學校裏的過於繁忙，起了癧子頸病症。現在我已經二十一歲了，在這帶病延年的五年裏頭，雖經各埠醫生診治，畢竟毫無見效。去年春間，對方因爲年齡關係，屢次請求舉行結婚。我爲了顧惜殘身起見，幾次推托。今年的春裏，我感於各方的慰勸，乃本着堅毅的决心，進本埠白克路某醫院開刀。雖然經過二次手術，但據醫生的論斷，一時難望痊愈，並且一定需要安心調養。我爲保重身體健康起見，當然不能在最近舉行結婚；不過如果對方來繼續請求的時候，那末我用什麽方法，可使對方滿意呢？眞使我爲難到十三分了。我本着十二萬分的誠意，期望着先生在短期間内，給我一個圓滿的辦法，那眞是感激不盡了。敬祝</p>

<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：顧君的病體，旣據醫生斷定，一時難望痊愈，當然以不結婚爲宜。因爲結婚的結果，不但對於你的病體，有絶大的危險，而且對於陳女士方面，也是有害無利。你覺得她們來要求結婚的時候，無可推托；這完全因爲你的觀念錯了的緣故。你祇知道不結婚爲（保重身體健康起見，）所以覺得不免自私，不便啓齒。你應當知道，不結婚的緣故，大半還爲了顧惜對方，那你就諍諍有詞了。萬一她們眞的堅持一見，定要結婚，你祇有寗可解約的一法。性命交關，不容屈服。</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>裏面一總有十六七張桌子，桌子上照例堆着些筆墨紙張，却不見有一個人，所有的人，像蟻聚似的緊擠在一個角子上，幾個在手舞足蹈的笑，幾個在數錢，幾個在（老寳）（夾花）的議論着，大家都全神貫注地望着中間的東西，誰也没有知道後面來了個伍逸。伍逸也不願意驚動他們，便背着手，悄悄地走過去，混進了他們的一羣。</p>
<p>在這些人包圍着的中間，也是一張尋常的公事檯，不過檯上却没有文房四寳，祗舖着一張白紙，紙上用紅墨水寫着阿拉伯字的一，二，三，四，四個大字，還有（一三）（二四）四個略小一倍的字，這些字上，都安着相當的錢，角子，銀元，鈔票全有；桌子的横頭，坐着一個神氣很嚴重的脚，他的前面，除掉一大堆鈔洋之外，還有一口倒覆着的磁缸，這個人的雙手，便牢地壓在缸上。</p>
<p>（齊了没有）？</p>
<p>（齊了！開！）四面的人，同時帶着一種（先死各聽天命）的神氣催促着，這個人便一鬆手·把那覆着的磁缸揭了開來；這一揭，禍可不小，頓時使四周的人一齊矮了三寸，每一個都灣了腰，搶先伸出了頭頸，望桌子上的東西看着，伍逸也忙挨在一個罅縫裏，用心瞧去。</p>
<p>覆在缸裏的原來是一堆雙毫一般大小的（全國各大學敎授抗日救國協會）的磁質徽章，約摸有二三十枚上下；坐在中央的一個人，便把牠們每四個分爲一組，一組一組地分着，分到結果，當然有了一個零數。</p>
<p>（一！哈哈！吃重配輕！）這一回的零數是一。於是中央那人便擄進了許多的錢，很滿意地笑着；有許多把錢安在（二）（三）或（四）字上的仁兄，便一個個的垂頭喪氣，不住的在發出種種極下流的咀咒。</p>
<p>（哈哈！老黄！三塊錢到手了！）有一個大槪是把錢壓在（一）字上，因此而得利的仁兄，一時高興得忘了形，旋過身來，也不瞧瞧清楚，理伸手抓住了伍逸的肩頭，拚命的撼着，笑着。</p>
<p>（朋友！對不起！吾們說一句話行吧？）伍逸拉高了嗓子，說了這三句話，立刻便把狂賭着的一羣救國協會的職員驚醒了過來；抓住着他的那一位先生，不用說，自然是早就鬆手了。伍逸臉上，却也全無怒意，一味儘笑。（鄙人姓伍，名逸，居然也是這會裏的執行委員之一！可是向來從不曾到過，竟不知道諸位常在這裏消遣：現在難知道了，也無力干涉。不過，我有一個請求，希望你們代我轉達常務委員李博士，請他看在我的面上，打今天起，就把大門上的那一方横匾摘了下來吧！）</p>
<p>伍逸突如其來的光臨和他這一番尖利的冷話，眞使這一羣醉生夢死的先生們　夠了，誰也不知道怎樣對付才好？</p>
<p>（再會吧·祝你們快樂·）老博士懷了一肚子的失望，跨着很細小的步子走了。</p>

<h3 id="c295">倫敦試映（春江花月夜）趣聞 <a href="#c295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— 馨甫</p>
<p>一百位未來新娘同蒞戲院</p>
<p>當烏發高蒙聯合出品（春江花月夜）Ｔｅｌｌ　Ｍｅ　Ｔｏｎｉｇｈｔ在倫敦某戲院試映的一天晚上，忽然有一百位未來的新娘子，先後蒞臨。而對方的未來新郎，就是該片主角傑克蒲拉Ｊａｎ　Ｋｅｉｐｕｒａ他是一位非常著名的波斯歌星。結果，傑克蒲拉因爲被别的事情牽住，未能蒞止，祗得另行函約會晤日期。這樁神秘的事情，究竟是怎樣發生的呢？且聽下回分解。</p>
<p>先是傑克蒲拉，在攝製這部片子的時候，有一位記者，到攝影塲裏去訪問他。他在無意中漏出了一句話，說是他很願意徵求一位英國女子和他結婚。不料那位記者，就把他的談話，在報紙上發表出來了。你想，以他的聲譽和豐采，加上每年還有三萬五千金鎊的進欵，那得不呌歐洲姑娘們崇拜和眼熱呢？於是乎應徵的信，紛至沓來，一共竟有一萬七千餘封之多。内中是英格蘭姑娘也有，蘇格蘭女士也有，愛爾蘭小姐也有；並且大部份的應徵信内，都附着各人美麗的照片。這一下，傑克蒲拉竟比開大照相館還要闊了。</p>
<p>後來等到片子拍好，接剪舒齊，預備在倫敦某戲院試映的時候。傑克蒲拉恰巧在别處奏藝，可是那一萬七千封信，還是携帶在身邊的。他就在這許多信中，挑選了一百封。把這一百位女士的姓名和住址，抄寫下來，寄給他的倫敦代表。告訴他，在試映（春江花月夜）的時候，必須要把這一百位女士，請來參觀，並且在片子映畢後，他還打算到倫敦來和她們見一見面。</p>
<p>但是，在傑克蒲拉的來信中，並没有把這事的詳情，告訴出來，所以當時就是影片公司和他的代表，都猜不出他爲什麽要請這許多女客。可是他旣有信來，祇好糊裏糊塗，遵照他的說話辦理。試片的那天，果然所請的女客都來了。不料傑克蒲拉，没有工夫來，於是這一百位女士，在片子映畢後，不見有人招待，祗好怏怏不樂的歸去了。後來傑克蒲拉，對人說了，大家方才明白。但據他自己說，這一次的舉動，並不是完全開玩笑，他的確很想在這一百位女士當中，找着一位他理想中的未婚妻呢！</p>

<h3 id="c296">評情偷　Ｄａｎｇｅｒｏｕｓｌｙ　Ｙｏｕｒｓ <a href="#c296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— 磊</p>
<p>故事是這樣的：一個衣冠楚楚的珠寳賊偷了一個老寡婦的首飾，當時祗有一個少女盡知其隱，但因愛賊故，而與賊偕遁。其後雖力勸其交出贓物，反被賊禁錮。某日於海中乘機逃出。從此賊因感女賢而良心發現，將首飾盡還原主，而終與女偕老。</p>
<p>像這樣的一個故事，當然是毫無意義的。但是也祇有美國的電影業者才肯爲之耗去如許金錢和精力。在這樣的情形之下，我們正可看出美國電影没落到何等地步。</p>
<p>講到導演，自然不能在一個平庸的本事中，創造出一個偉大的作品來。但是雖然如此，不過他在演出方面，連故事的叙述，亦不能清楚的告訴我們，這一點不能不說是導演的幼稚。全篇一律的没有詳明的系統，不注意表演而着重於不必要的對話。可是對於鏡頭的運用，倒也不是如何坯的，幾個海面的外景也很不錯。還有少女在船上兩次呼救，都以不同的方法庶蓋過去，這一點却是導演聰明的地方，也是劇中的精采。他如心靈學家作法時的鏡頭也很可以。</p>
<p>至於表演，可謂極其平庸。主角是那樣懶懶的全不賣力，女主角又是以一個半老徐娘來飾少女，都是令人感覺不快的。配角中亦無精采可言，祗有抛撲克的那一位極不重要的女角，倒還有一點特殊的風采。至於那一丑角，我們在（璇宮艷史）似乎見過一面，但是在這裏的幾個表情，雖然不是何等生硬，却亦不能令人發笑。所以本劇的幾個（噱頭）也是不收成效的。</p>
<p>其他方面：燈光的空間和時間的分别，都很逼眞。尤其是那心靈學家作法的兩個塲面，都很美麗。佈景平平，没有特色破綻。收音總算純凈得可以過得去。但是雖然有了這等成績，總到底是不能使本劇提上水準的吧。</p>

<p>— 思蘋</p>
<p>日前在美國總會放映中西人士參觀者甚衆</p>
<p>美國商會星期一晚上假花旗總會演映美國公路有聲影片，中外政商學各界領袖被邀前去參觀的盛極一時。公路影片開映之前，美國商會會長富朗樞及美國商務參贊安諾德發表簡短的歡迎詞和介紹詞。其中最切要的一句是說公路發展現代中國的交通佔着非常重要的地位，美國大造公路以利交通，同時也希望帮助别國做這樣的建設事業。演說完畢便接着演映公路影片；這影片把一九三○年美國公路計劃完成，五十一國代表被邀前往參觀時的情形供獻給我們。各國代表自華盛頓出發分乘長途汽車沿途參觀，一段一段都有字幕說明。美國公路共三百萬英里。有聯邦政府資助築成的，有各州政府資助築成的，有地方政府築成的。北自加拿大邊境到極南墨西哥邊境，東自大西洋海岸到南面太平洋海岸，縱横貫通各州各市各鄕村，有汽車的人可以隨心所欲自駕汽車四通八達隨便開到什麽地方。美國人眞幸福丨影片裏面把從前遲緩的人工築路進步到後來迅速的機器築路的情形，三合土硬面的幹路以及輕便的支路一條條一層層建築的情形統統告訴給我們。有幾處上面是鐵路下面是公路，或者上面是公路下面是鐵路，十字形的交叉着。最後，影片裏把各州的公路網作成統計式的映出眞是密密層層的象一個網。看了之後眞是不勝艷羨，並且想到中國二十餘年來，送到外國去買軍火助長内亂的金錢，能拿來築路或興築其他的公益事業，那亦就很可觀了。</p>

<p>— 訥</p>
<p>喬易經過幾次戰爭，幸未遇有意外。自一九一四年，一九一五年，直至一九一八年，他在這種昏天黑地的歲月中，還時時回到倫敦尋着他的愛侶蘩妮，過他們愛情的生活。那天是一九一八年的一個晚上，喬易和蘩妮一同晚餐後，回到蘩妮的化妝室裏。當時喬易又要出發上前敵了。他們依依惜别難分難解。蘩妮將一枚金鎖片贈給喬易，内中嵌了自己一張小小的倩影，叮嘱他好好地掛在身邊。喬易叮嘱她要天天寫信給他。化妝室的外面，奏着音樂。台上幕啟幕閉，一齣一齣地過去。蘩妮化妝室的門，已經敲了好幾次，催她出去。到最後一分鐘，蘩妮還是依依不捨地和喬易說着綿綿的情話。外面又喊着（勃烈吉斯小姐，快些吧）！這樣她不能不出去了。喬易在臨别的一霎那間，仔細向蘩妮的臉端詳着，她的笑容，她的勇敢，她的淚痕，她内心的沉痛，都已深深地印入他的心坎，一直到他的死。不過再有一兩個月，一切都完結了！</p>
<p>這天係一九一八年的休戰日，琪茵的侍女回說：（勃烈吉斯夫人來拜訪）。琪茵驚疑不定的請了她進來。愛倫氣槪高傲得很，穿了巴黎式的時裝，手中拿了看戲用的望遠竟，氣槪凌人，絶不似僕婦對舊日主婦的樣子。琪茵伸出手來說道：（愛倫，我做夢亦想不到是你）。愛倫亦不和她握手，她說（我有很要緊的事，不能不來和你商量）。琪茵說（好極了，我很想見你。請坐下，告訴我一切的事情，蘩妮好嗎）？愛倫氣咻咻地說：（我來就是爲她的事，爲她和喬易的事）！琪茵很驚異地問（喬易）？愛倫說：就是。他們：：：我亦不用隱瞞了，他們已經有了關係了。我想：：：）（你想什麽）？琪茵一天因爲休戰而生的快樂都冰消了。愛倫說：（現在戰事停止了，喬易快要回來了，我想他們應當結婚了）。琪茵問愛倫，蘩妮知道不知道她來。愛倫搖搖頭。琪茵心中好似寬慰了好些，幸　蘩妮不是那拆白一類的女子，不然喬易會和這種女子發生關係，太不知自愛了。她向愛倫說道：（這事祇好等喬易回來了再說吧。我是向來不管我兒子的閒事的。你未來之先，亦應當和蘩妮商量一下。這個問題，祇好日後再討論罷。再會，愛倫）。</p>
<p>愛倫聽了，祇好徐徐地向客室的門退出去。但她忽然地又回轉身來，盛氣向着琪茵道：（你不要以爲蘩妮不配嫁你的兒子吧？你要是這樣想，你就差了！蘩妮是到處受歡迎的人，所交際的都是第一流的人物。况且現在已不比從前，一切都變換了。不過有人隨着時代向前走，有人自甘落後吧了）。（未完）</p>

<p>The enemy army retreated eastward from Beidaihe last night. He Zhuguo's troops advanced and occupied Changli Railway Station. Weng's division made contact with the enemy at Lugaozhuang. The Pingjin Military Council discussed military plans.</p>
<p>(Beiping) News on the 26th stated that enemy troops on both sides of Xifengkou and Lengkou are confronting our forces outside the passes. There is no official confirmation of the recovery of Changli. However, Japanese troops in that area have retreated, leaving only one or two thousand puppet soldiers. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Luanzhou Telegram: Last night, the enemy continued to retreat from Beidaihe along the Nandasi-Qinhuangdao line, and is expected to retreat to the east bank of the Shihe River by tomorrow. Our vanguard troops from Shi's regiment are following up and advanced, having entered Changli last night and pushing eastward. This morning, they reached the vicinity of Liushouying. Part of our cavalry has reached Xilizhuang west of Beidaihe. Refugees from various counties are returning to their homes. This morning at dawn, an enemy plane scouted the Changli area but did not drop any bombs. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo will personally go to eastern Luan to supervise the army. A special train is waiting at Luan Station for departure. There were fierce battles this morning between Lulong and Funing. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the evening of the 24th, the enemy's 16th Division was discovered in the Tuchengtou and Majialing area northwest of Xinglong County, and appeared to be invading Xinglong County. We are on high alert in Huangyaguan and Malanyu. At 10:00 AM on the 25th, four enemy planes dropped seven bombs on Huangyaguan. Dou Zonghan, the magistrate of Xinglong County, has reported to the provincial government. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo's army, Shi Shian's regiment, entered Changli Railway Station this afternoon. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

More than twenty people attended, including He Yingqin, Jiang Bocheng, Wan Fulin, Wang Shuchang, Bao Wenxue, Rong Zhen, Xu Yongchang, Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Shang Zhen, Yu Xuezhong, and Fu Zuoyi. He Yingqin chaired the meeting and gave a report, followed by reports from various generals on the progress of the operations. A detailed discussion was held on the overall military situation in North China, administrative issues, the current retreat of the Japanese army, and our army's future deployments. The meeting adjourned after 12:00 PM. Afterwards, He invited the generals to a luncheon at Jurentang. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The railway tracks between Luanzhou and Changli and the Beining line have been completely repaired. Telephone and telegraph lines are being repaired urgently. Passenger trains on the Beining line can now reach Anshan Station and will extend to Changli in a day or two. Only a small number of Japanese and traitorous troops are currently in Beidaihe and Qinhuangdao, and they appear to be retreating. The various passes along the Great Wall are all in a state of confrontation. Enemy troops at Lengkou are still guarding the pass. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

On the night of the 24th, the enemy brought twenty cars and five tanks from outside the pass to Koucheng, but did not advance, apparently for the night shift change of the guarding troops. The front lines have been quiet for several days, but Japanese planes occasionally fly into the pass to bomb. On the 24th, three planes flew to Santunying and dropped bombs, almost completely flattening the houses there. The bombs have both explosive and incendiary functions, causing great damage. Song brought back a bomb, which is conical in shape, two to three feet high, and can blast to a depth of over a zhang and a diameter of fifteen or sixteen zhangs. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong came to Beiping from Tianjin at 8:30 AM this morning to attend the routine meeting of the Military Council and is scheduled to return to Tianjin tonight. According to him, the reasons for the Japanese army's retreat outside Luanzhou and the various passes of the Great Wall are: first, the Japanese army's forces on the front lines are not very strong, and they fear that the truth will be revealed after a long time, so they retreat to concentrate their forces and focus on defending the various passes, while also indicating to the international community that they have no intentions towards North China; second, the enemy army has always used the method of defeating us individually. This time, the attack on eastern Luan clearly intended to threaten the hinterland of North China. Recently, they may have decided that the detour was too long, so they concentrated their forces and advanced from Xinglong to peep at Sanhe and Miyun, threatening Beiping and Tianjin, which is easier than attacking from eastern Luan. Two hundred enemy troops have already been discovered near Xinglong and have been repelled by our army. Today, approximately one battalion of enemy troops outside Gubeikou are shelling us, but the other passes are all confronting each other near the outside of the passes. Because the reasons for the enemy army's retreat are unclear, we have decided to first send small units to search forward to observe the changes. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central People's Movement Association has decided on six measures to help Chinese cotton mills from the perspective of taking into account the pain of both labor and management and the future of the national economy: (1) The central government should coordinate with the banking sector to provide low-interest loans to various cotton mills to stabilize their operations and, to the extent possible, shorten construction time and take care of the workers' lives. (2) Strictly order party headquarters at all levels to inform the people of the country to actively promote domestic goods and to effectively sell accumulated domestic cotton and cloth. (3) At present, the policy base for foreign goods dumping is the interior of our country. In order to facilitate transportation and reduce costs, Chinese merchants should produce in different locations and quickly unite various cotton mills to form temporary, more monopolistic organizations in order to develop together. (4) Seek fundamental solutions to eliminate all motivating factors that harm industry. (5) Reduce the tax rate on domestic cotton to the extent possible to provide protection. (6) In addition to reducing taxes on various domestic light industries, quickly implement production controls to make consumption and production a normal ratio and avoid wasting manpower and financial resources.

<p>(Peiping) The Northeast territory is two and a half times the size of Japan. Japan has decided to develop resources to fulfill its ambitions of aggression. The first step is to implement a 20-year survey plan for Manchuria and Mongolia with 10 million yuan. A 150-member suicide squad from the Japanese Army Survey Department will travel fully armed to remote areas of Manchuria and Mongolia with the latest surveying equipment to conduct surveys. In the first year, Japan will bear 400,000 yuan for surveying expenses to survey the large forests along the railway. Fearing attacks from the volunteer army, three light machine guns and an aerial surveying team with Type 88 reconnaissance aircraft will be used to coordinate land and air operations. The survey area is estimated to be more than 77,000 Japanese square miles. It is expected that upon completion of the survey, the most accurate map of Manchuria and Mongolia in the world will be produced. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenhui and Deng Xihou are fighting fiercely in the Chengdu area of Sichuan. The person in charge of the Sichuan representatives in Nanjing was summoned to Jiangxi, so the staff left behind have not received any reports and mostly deny the matter. However, people from Sichuan received airmail from Chongqing, detailing the causes and consequences, stating that the situation has escalated and the forces participating in the battle are more than 100,000. It is currently the time for planting spring opium, and in the most recent quarter, seven counties can collect opium taxes of 1.1 million yuan. Liu and Deng are using all their strength to compete for these seven counties. Furthermore, three units of a certain friendly army have also been dispatched to mediate the dispute with armed force, requesting Liu and Deng to make concessions and allow the friendly army to station troops in the seven counties. Liu Xiang ostensibly claims not to be involved, but slightly favors Deng. (Special dispatch on the 26th)</p>

It is undecided whether he will return to Nanjing and then go north or go north from Jiangxi to Wuhan. The date of his departure north may not be far off. Song Zheyuan has not yet recovered from his back pain. In view of the urgent situation at the front, he has gone to the front line despite his illness.

<h3 id="e48">War News - Sigh <a href="#e48" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c48" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">48</a></h3>
<p>In recent days, after the Japanese military announced its withdrawal, Japanese troops have been withdrawing to the east of the Shi River. Today, the commanding general of the forward troops returned to Peiping and reported at the Peiping branch that the Japanese side was withdrawing its troops, indicating that there should be no fighting on the front line. However, on the one hand, telegraphic news indicates that the fighting at Gubeikou and Xifengkou is still very fierce and frequent, and there are frequent warnings of Japanese troops attacking Peiping and Tientsin. Is it a withdrawal, an attack, a truce, or a fierce battle? This contradictory news is truly bewildering. However, in our opinion, even if the Japanese side withdraws its troops, it is by no means without a reason, and it does not mean that it will stop its ambitions of aggression. We must vow to exert our utmost efforts to fight them to the death, but it is unexpected that so-called scholars and celebrities are criticizing the loyal and brave soldiers who are (taking off their shirts and wielding the big knives forged in the blacksmith's shop) (using flesh and blood to fight against the most cruel and modern weapons) as being contrary to modern civilization, or even saying that they are overestimating their abilities, and therefore advocating waiting for fifty years. We truly cannot understand this kind of view.</p>
<p>Moreover, since the abandonment of Rehe, Peiping has been under the enemy's overlooking gaze, and the people are in a state of constant anxiety. The situation in North China is also extremely complex, and crises are lurking. Even if the Japanese side withdraws its troops, it is only to lure our side into compromise in order to take a temporary rest and wait for an opportunity to advance again. If we are fooled by them and do not make the final determination to resist, then the result will be that even if we can enjoy temporary peace today, the crisis will eventually be unimaginable. If we say that today's Washington conference, where the great powers of Britain, France, and the United States are all eager to seek to stabilize the world's finances, and that in order to stabilize the world's finances, it is necessary to first restore peace in the Far East, and that Japan will inevitably take some action, and that our country still has a glimmer of hope, this kind of mentality is no different from the previous reliance on the League of Nations. What will the effect ultimately be?</p>
<p>As for our people, during the January 28th Incident, donations were extremely enthusiastic, and whatever was needed at the front, the rear would immediately provide. This time, the battle line along the Great Wall is 1,800 miles long, ten times longer than the battle line in Shanghai, and the spring cold is biting, the ash and sand are blowing in the face, and the mountain roads are rugged, making marching extremely difficult. The hardship is several times greater than the Shanghai battle. However, our people's donations are less than one-tenth of what they were during the Shanghai battle. This is truly something we cannot understand. Alas, the orioles are flying, the swallows are dancing, and the variegated flowers are blooming. The spring scenery in the south of the Yangtze River is indeed beautiful, and the wind is clear and the sun is bright. Our people can indeed enjoy themselves and forget their worries. However, the loyal and brave soldiers at the front are enduring hunger and cold, risking their lives, and fighting with their flesh and blood to protect the survival of our nation. Can we not feel a pang of conscience when we reflect on ourselves? Moreover, can we continue to watch from the sidelines for long? In short, today, the matter has become urgent. Should we fight or not? Our government and people must think about it thoroughly.</p>

<p>Leave Guo Taiqi in Geneva to Preside</p>
<p>Soviet Union Tends to Support Our Country's Position</p>
<p>(Geneva) After meeting with key figures in France and Britain in Paris and London, Chinese representative Gu Weijun returned to Geneva this morning. He stated that he will take a ship to New York on Saturday to confer with Finance Minister Song Ziwen and US officials on various issues. Gu believes that if the Far East is not stabilized, efforts to restore world trade and large-scale disarmament will be futile. Therefore, this trip will ask the US government to take swift and decisive action on the Manchurian issue. It is reported that after Gu arrives in the US, he will first report to Song Ziwen on his recent talks with key European figures, and then the two will meet with US President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull to discuss everything. Since Roosevelt and British Prime Minister MacDonald will discuss disarmament and general peace, as well as the world economic situation, Gu plans to take the opportunity to strongly emphasize the importance of resolving the Manchurian issue for restoring the world economy, so as to avoid further bloodshed in North China, and to make an agreement on disarmament possible. Moreover, according to Gu's opinion, if military activities in North China are not stopped, China and Japan will have to sever diplomatic relations. As for the Soviet Union's attitude, diplomatic circles here generally believe that it agrees in principle with China's view that economic recovery can only be achieved after world peace. Therefore, the Soviet Union will support China's position at the London Economic Conference in the future. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>

It may be sent to the advisory committee members at the end of this week, and it is expected that a full meeting of the advisory committee will be convened thereafter. There is an impression here that the major powers are not eager to implement an arms embargo, preferring to intensify world public opinion against the non-recognition of puppet organizations. League of Nations members and other diplomats are closely watching the talks in Washington to see if the Far East issue will be raised. It is generally believed that the League of Nations members will not be able to take any concrete action against Japan and Manchuria until they see the results of the Washington talks.

Afterward, experts from France and the US gathered with Secretary of State Hull at the State Department to discuss matters. At noon, Hull hosted a banquet for MacDonald, Herriot, and Canadian Prime Minister Bennett. It is reported that Bennett's visit to the US, in addition to general talks, is also to prepare to negotiate a reciprocal trade agreement with the US for many items not included in the Ottawa Agreement. The first trilateral meeting between US President Roosevelt, MacDonald, and Herriot will be held tonight. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of State Hull has given a strong indication today that Britain, the US, and France now believe that a guarantee of peace is a necessary condition for the world's economic recovery. Hull stated that the US is willing to sign a consultation treaty with other countries under certain limitations, and indicated that signing this treaty would encourage international trade. However, while the US is willing to sign this treaty, it does not want to bear the actual responsibility of intervening. According to the State Department's disclosure today, this attitude is sufficient to confirm the previous rumors that talks between the US President, the British Prime Minister, and the former French Prime Minister discussed the issue of restoring international trust.

British Prime Minister MacDonald is scheduled to return to London tomorrow, but the British experts who came to the US with the Prime Minister will remain in Washington to complete the few remaining items.

<h3 id="e54">Understanding Reached on War Debt Issue Between Britain and US <a href="#e54" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c54" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">54</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) According to an official announcement released this afternoon, President Wisforth and British Prime Minister MacDonald discussed the war debt issue today, and both sides have reached a clear understanding of the issues involving Britain and the US. Although a solution has not yet been decided, there has been good progress, and these negotiations will continue in Washington and London in the future. (Reuters Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Progress has been made on a satisfactory solution to the war debt issue and efforts will continue in London and Washington after MacDonald leaves the US. This statement was released in a joint communiqué issued tonight by Roosevelt and MacDonald, who held a trilateral meeting with Herriot tonight before suddenly summoning the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the White House at about 10 p.m. The communiqué was issued after the Foreign Relations Committee went to the White House to consult on opinions. The attitude of the senators was not disclosed in the communiqué, but it is expected that they generally agree with the understanding reached by the three leaders thus far. However, this understanding should not be regarded as an agreement to amend the war debt structure. It only means that the US President and the British Prime Minister have found a possible path to a solution. The fact that the communiqué was signed only by Roosevelt and MacDonald is because Herriot did not participate in all the talks. However, Herriot stated when meeting with reporters that he fully agreed with what has been discussed at the White House so far, which can also reveal his attitude. The US President's sudden summons of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the White House is expected to consult on the opinions of the Senate on the war debt issue and some economic proposals. It is reported that a certain proposed solution was presented to the senators, and several expressed their support. However, former Chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee Borah did not go to the White House and did not state the reason for his absence. Although it is now believed that Borah must have been invited beforehand and asked to explain the reason for his absence, as there is no excuse to refuse the White House's summons, it is estimated that a new precedent will be set in official etiquette. Borah's usual attitude is to advocate exchanging special trade rights for war debts. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Washington) It is heard that the issues considered by the US authorities and the British and French representatives include bimetallism, so as to use more silver as a monetary base.

However, this plan may not be implemented unless it is agreed to by other countries. (Reuters Telegram on the 25th)</p>

The progress made has exceeded the expectations of both sides before the British Prime Minister arrived in Washington. It is heard that a general basis of understanding has been established, and a solid basis for consolidating the currency system is also included. It is heard that the talks between the French and US representatives are the same as those between the British and US representatives, and they also discussed adopting a bimetallic system and reducing the gold reserve by a certain percentage and replacing it with silver.

<p>(New York) The New York Tribune's Washington dispatch stated that, according to appearances, if the US wants to lower the value of the US dollar, the Canadian authorities are prepared to follow the US's monetary behavior and are prepared to support the US experts' informal proposal to include a certain percentage of silver in the central bank's gold reserve.

<p>(Washington) The British budget does not include the provision to repay the debt owed to the US on June 15. This move was expected by the Americans, as the previous year's budget also did not have this provision. Although officials are paying attention to this matter, they do not attach much importance to it. France's attitude towards the debt due in June is still undecided. Some here say that Britain's open disregard for the issue of debt repayment is influenced by the Farm Relief Act of the US, the Thomas Amendment, which advocates allowing the President to allow debtor countries to repay debts with silver up to 100 million yuan. India has a large amount of silver reserves, and the method of repaying debts with silver is very convenient for Britain. (Reuters Telegram on the 25th)</p>

Republicans say the move is unconstitutional and shakes the public's trust. Democrats, on the other hand, support it, saying it is a cautious plan and not unlimited inflation. Government leaders expect the bill to pass tomorrow without changes, while there are rumors that several compromise solutions are being considered, one of which aims to remove the power to reduce the gold content of the currency and replace it with the minting of more silver coins or the purchase of silver.

<p>(Washington) It is rumored tonight that Republicans and Democrats who advocate the use of silver are now planning to form a mixed group to eliminate the clause in the inflation bill that reduces the gold content of the US dollar and replace it with an amendment for the free minting of silver coins. The proposed ratio between gold and silver, according to unconfirmed sources, is 25 to 1. The Washington correspondent of the Wall Street Journal pointed out that the mixed action of Republicans and Democrats is a plot by those who oppose the Thomas proposal to use silver bullets to kill this bill, but it is expected that their plot will fail, and the Thomas proposal will be passed by 60 votes. From the perspective of the government-appointed senators, the reduction of the gold content of the US dollar is legal, so they will strongly resist any changes. The Thomas proposal is an amendment to the Farm Relief Act, authorizing the Treasury Department to consult with the Federal Reserve Board to purchase 300 million yuan of government bonds. If the purchase of government bonds cannot be negotiated, the President can directly issue 300 million yuan of Treasury bills. The President can also reduce the gold content of the US dollar, but not by more than 50%. The US can allow other countries to repay debts with silver, up to a value of 100 million US dollars, and the price of silver cannot exceed 50 cents per ounce. The US can issue silver certificates based on the amount of silver it receives from foreign governments. The above is the plan in the Thomas proposal. Now some people are advocating to increase the amount of silver allowed for foreign repayment of debts to 250 million yuan. (Reuters Telegram on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The opinion in the business community is that unilateral trade is impossible. If India refuses to buy Japanese goods, then Japan will have to retaliate. Someone inquired with the Commerce Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs whether Japan would buy raw cotton from the US. The spokesperson of the bureau replied that he did not know, but everything depends on what India wants to do. The official also mentioned the commercial relations between India and Japan, saying that except for last year, they have always been beneficial to India. If the Indian government had given Japan a chance to discuss everything before implementing the strict plan to cancel the India-Japan commercial treaty, it would have greatly benefited the long-term friendship between the two countries. The Japanese business community claims that the depreciation of currency is temporary. As for trade barriers, once they are erected, they are difficult to remove. When the yen depreciated by 20%, India had already increased the import tax on Japanese goods from 30% to 50%. (Reuters Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Although some people in the Japanese cotton textile industry advocate that Japan should boycott Indian cotton when the London Seymoura talks fail, as a retaliatory plan for the abolition of the Japan-India commercial treaty, officials believe that this boycott is harmful and useless to Japan. This is because Japan's move will cause the price of Indian cotton to fall, allowing competitors to purchase cheaper cotton, and the raw cotton that Japan needs to purchase from other places will inevitably rise in price. Officials now have high hopes for the world economic discussions in both Washington and London, but the government seems to expect that a solution can always be established along the lines of an agreement to regulate exports.

<p>The US Sets the Reorganization of Old Russian Debts as a Condition</p>
<p>Congressional Members Tend to Recognize Russia with Increasing Force</p>
<p>(Washington) The restoration of diplomatic relations between the United States and Russia, according to tonight's situation, is expected to be still far off. Reliable sources say that the Soviet government has yet to express its willingness to reorganize or consider the debts owed to American officials and businesses before the establishment of the Soviet government. It is said that someone informally inquired about this matter with the Soviet Union some time ago, but there has been no reply. As for the attitude of the United States, although it does not insist that the entire amount of 768,583,000 gold dollars owed to American officials and businesses during the old Russian era must be repaid in full, it strongly advocates that the Soviet Union must recognize and reorganize this debt to avoid setting an unprecedented historical precedent. It is also heard that the US State Department anticipates that the Soviet Union will propose a counter-proposal after the start of negotiations,</p>
<p>demanding compensation for losses and damages caused by the US military's intervention in Siberia. It also anticipates that the Soviet Union will propose repayment over a long period after recognition, and pay it together with the interest on new debts borrowed thereafter. The US government also has answers to this, but Russia has so far made no indication of recognizing the old debts. At present, the forces in the US Congress who support recognizing the Soviet Union are quite strong, and there is hope that diplomatic relations can be restored before the London Conference. The government is also willing to handle it in the manner of the restoration of diplomatic relations between Britain and Russia in 1924. As for the issue of communist propaganda after recognition, the US government is not afraid, and it is expected that mutual agreements can adequately prevent mutual interference in internal affairs. Moreover, the Communist Party only had 102,000 votes in the last presidential election in the United States, indicating that its power is gradually declining. (National Telegram, 25th)</p>

According to the spokesman for the Ministry of the Army, the Japanese army south of the Great Wall has completed its work of driving the Chinese army out of the Great Wall front line and eliminating the pressure of the Chinese army on the border of Rehe. Therefore, it has been ordered to stop the pursuit. If the Chinese army rushes into the neutral zone after the Japanese army withdraws, the Japanese army aircraft will attack them. Japan wants to withdraw a portion of the Japanese army participating in the Rehe and North China battles back to their original defense in northern Manchuria. Japan has no intention of helping (Manchukuo) expand its territory south to the Great Wall. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Recently, people from Jiangsu and Anhui have heard that Henan Province intends to divert the Yellow River into the Huai River, and the public is very worried. According to the Huai River Guidance Association, the association has sent a letter to the Henan Provincial Government to inquire about the truth. Now, it has been replied that Henan Province recently dredged the original river course due to the siltation of the Huiji River in order to drain the accumulated water in the city of Kaifeng. In the past, there was a proposal to divert the Yellow River into Shandong, but it has not yet been surveyed. Even if it is necessary, it should be discussed in detail with the relevant provinces downstream before making a decision. As for the rumor that construction has already started in northern Henan, it is even more untrue. (Special Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>▲Reuters Geneva Telegram, 25th: The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference reconvened today. China, Turkey, France, Russia, Poland, and Norway all submitted amendments to the British draft. Dr. Gu Weijun, the Chinese representative, explained the purpose of the Chinese amendments, saying that the effect of these amendments is to strengthen the restrictions on the use of force. Therefore, the numbers (using war or force to resolve international disputes) have been revised in order to prevent various armed acts that endanger world peace and the safety of the people. Other points of the Chinese amendments are aimed at the early conclusion of the Disarmament Convention and making it effective so as not to undermine existing peace tools. Dr. Gu also proposed a clause as follows: (The signatory countries, which are also members of the League of Nations, hereby declare that the existing form of the convention shall not prejudice the rights and obligations of the members of the League of Nations, nor shall it conflict with the powers of the Executive Council under the League of Nations Covenant). After the other five countries successively stated the scope of their amendments, the General Commission adjourned until tomorrow. The British disarmament plan was submitted to the General Commission last month, suggesting numerical limits for European troops and quantitative limits for tanks and mobile heavy artillery. It also suggested that the Maritime Disarmament Convention should be popularized as far as possible. All aerial bombardments, with a few exceptions, should be prohibited. The British disarmament plan also mentioned chemical, bacteriological, and incendiary warfare, naval and air aircraft, and advocated that Germany should be exempt from the naval restrictions in the Treaty of Versailles, but its existing status should continue until the end of 1936.</p>
<p>▲Havas Geneva Telegram, 25th: The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference was able to start its work. The French delegation specifically published a document on a part of the British proposal related to the security issue, stating that France advocates submitting the issue of consultation treaties to the General Commission. France will express its opinions on this matter after waiting for countries outside the League of Nations to explain their views. The Political Committee had previously decided to organize a sub-committee to draft the European Mutual Assistance Treaty. France intends to submit a complete proposal on the issue of local treaties after this sub-committee is organized. However, France intends to propose the following claims immediately, namely (1) Publish a declaration of non-use of violence to bind all European countries, (2) Conclude a general treaty to promote methods of preventing war, (3) The following two types of countries have the right to enjoy assistance, (A) Countries participating in the general treaty, when encountering various situations stipulated in existing security treaties or security treaties that are about to be signed, (B) European countries, when subjected to obvious violations. What constitutes obvious infringement should be determined within the European scope according to the suggestion of the Soviet Union, (4) Establish supervisory committees in the capitals of various countries, (5) The mutual assistance measures agreed upon by European countries shall be implemented, (6) Conclude a financial mutual assistance treaty, all European countries shall be bound.</p>
<p>▲Havas Geneva Telegram, 25th: The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference reconvened. Chairman Henderson and US Representative Davis, on behalf of his colleagues, congratulated Mr. Henderson on his new Carnegie Endowment for International Peace Prize. The committee immediately discussed the part of the British proposal related to security issues.</p>
<p>The Polish representative proposed three amendments: (1) Argued that the League of Nations Covenant and the Paris Non-Aggression Pact should be included in the future disarmament convention as part of the convention, (2) Argued that the obligations stipulated in the British proposal regarding (prohibiting engagement in war) should be extended to (prohibiting the use of violence), (3) The signatory countries of the future disarmament convention, whether or not they are members of the League of Nations, may initiate the convening of consultation meetings in accordance with a procedure in the event of an incident. This procedure will be determined separately. The Polish representative specifically requested the United States to participate in the consultation treaty.</p>
<p>▲Reuters Geneva Telegram, 26th: When the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference met this afternoon, US representative Davis announced the US's attitude towards security issues, saying that although the US supports (the policy of mutual consultation), the provisions of the British draft regarding mutual consultation are too strict. The United States will announce its acceptable methods of mutual consultation later, but this method is tied to the degree of disarmament achieved and is especially related to the reduction of aggressive armaments. After a general discussion, it was felt that the British plan was not well received, so it was decided not to put it to a vote. The General Commission then adjourned. The meeting was very short, and it will reconvene tomorrow.</p>

<p>▲Reuters London Telegram, 25th: Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain said in his budget speech that the beer tax would be reduced, but retail prices must also be reduced, and the wine trade must be improved. Therefore, the beer tax will be completely changed so that those who improve the quality can reduce the price by one penny per item. It is estimated that the reduction in the beer tax will reduce government revenue by 14 million pounds. He also said that there is absolutely no reason to be pessimistic about Britain's financial prospects. If guided by sound and experienced principles and policies, there will be no danger to Britain's finances. Income tax cannot be reduced at present. The payment of income tax has always been divided into two times a year. In the previous term, three-quarters of the total annual income tax had to be paid at the first payment. Now, this method is inconvenient and it is still changed to be paid in two equal installments. Other than that, there are no other changes. Chamberlain announced that the final estimated income was 698,777,000 pounds and the expenditure was 697,486,000 pounds. The estimated surplus was 1,291,000 pounds. The Chancellor's speech lasted two hours and seven minutes before it was finished.</p>
<p>▲London Telegram, 26th: Chamberlain's second budget after taking office as Chancellor of the Exchequer was stable and without brilliance. Even those who support the government are not very interested in it. The Times pointed out that the Chancellor of the Exchequer lacked imagination. It is generally believed that the stability of the financial situation and the shrinkage of tax sources should be a reason for making extra efforts to help trade recover. The only thing that can be noted is that the changes in tax rates in the budget are political rather than financial in nature. The increase in the tax on heavy oil is to protect the coal industry, and the new tax on motor vehicles is to help poorly performing railways, while the reduction in beer tax is to encourage breweries to use more domestic buckwheat.</p>

<p>Will Conclude a Treaty of Friendship with Poland</p>
<p>▲Havas Prague Telegram, 25th: Foreign Minister Benes said in a speech to Parliament that when Germany and Italy adopt a policy of amending treaties, the Czech Republic has two purposes. First, small countries being sacrificed to the mutual jealousy of strong countries is a thing of the past. The Czech Republic will do its best to prevent it from being seen today. Second, the coordination of various small countries will ensure that the governments of European countries are still based on democracy and oppose modifying the procedures of the League of Nations by arbitrary methods, and part of the affairs under the jurisdiction of the League of Nations will be removed and not allowed to be handled. Benes mentioned the amendment of treaties, saying that no independent country can allow other countries to use political and spiritual power to arbitrarily decide on its territory, or mutually compromise. Benes recalled that when he was previously in Geneva, he had told British Foreign Secretary Simon that he could not force certain countries to correct their borders. He said at the time, "If anyone plots against the Czech Republic, no matter what he plots, this person must come armed to seek the land he covets." Benes also said that even if the clauses on land in the treaty do need to be amended, it must be done after a long period of preparation, with fair compensation, and after direct compromise and free recognition by the countries concerned. The Foreign Minister believes that there is only one way to seek sound and fair cooperation among countries, that is, all countries, regardless of size, should compromise directly and frankly and exchange views with each other. As Benes's speech was coming to an end, he announced that the Czech Republic hopes to sign a treaty of friendship with Poland soon.</p>

<h3 id="e105">Jin Shuren's Improper Measures The Hui Rebellion Has International Backgrounds The Future of Xinjiang Province Is Extremely Dangerous <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The occurrence of the Hui Rebellion in Xinjiang coincided with the urgent invasion of North China by the Japanese, which has aroused the attention of the Chinese people. Recently, a certain important person from Xinjiang living in Beiping talked about the course of the Xinjiang Incident and the recent situation in Xinjiang Province. It is described as follows for the reference of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Causes of the Incident <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Xinjiang is located in the northwest of our country, spanning thousands of miles. It is a vast land with abundant resources and rich products. On the southern route of the Tianshan Mountains, there are tens of thousands of acres of fertile land and millions of residents. It is indeed an important area on the northwest border of our country. During the tenure of Yang Zengxin as the governor of Xinjiang Province, the old system was maintained, and the government and the people were able to live in peace. The current authorities are oppressing them very urgently, and the people are becoming more and more alienated. The people of Xinjiang Province are mostly Hui people, and they are strong and united. The feelings between the two sides are getting worse day by day, leading to the rebellion.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Loss of Hami <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The region of Hami is a crucial town in the eastern part of Xinjiang. During the late Qing Dynasty, it had a Hui King (Muslim King) overseeing its governance. After the establishment of the Republic of China, the position was still hereditary, managing the rental of its enclosed lands and trivial matters of the Hui people. The king enjoyed considerable influence due to the deep faith of the masses. When it came to the reign of Shamo Husuote (called "Prince Sha" by the Han people), his tyranny and arrogance gradually alienated the people. Last spring, when Shamo Husuote passed away, the Hui people, dissatisfied with the behavior of the young Hui King Niezi'er, sent representatives to meet with Chairman Jin Shuren, requesting that the Hui King position not be succeeded. They offered to pay all due taxes directly to the provincial government to alleviate their suffering. Jin initially agreed, but later, influenced by his subordinates, he broke his promise and confiscated all the Hui people's enclosed lands, stirring up popular resentment. At the beginning of this month, the people rose up, disarmed the provincial army stationed in Hami, and occupied the city of Hami.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Distress Call from Dihua <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Jin Shuren was originally from Didao in Gansu province. The majority of his troops were his fellow townsmen. They had a full nominal roster, ostensibly five divisions, but were understaffed, lacked training, and were extremely weak. Once an incident occurred, dealing with it would be exceedingly difficult. In this recent Hui rebellion in Hami, the Hui people's weapons were mostly supplied by a certain country and were exceptionally sophisticated. After capturing Hami, they advanced westward and occupied the Gongdao Ridge in Zhenxi (west of Hami). The Hui people of Kashi, Kashgar, and other areas of the southern route of the Tianshan Mountains, as well as the Mongol people of Alxa, rose up in response. It is rumored that Ma Zhongying's troops, stationed in Gansu, have also departed from Jiayuguan (the end point of the Great Wall and a strategic point for transportation between Gansu and Xinjiang) and are advancing towards Hami. Their intentions are yet to be confirmed. Currently, Dihua (Urumqi, a major town in the northwest) is in extreme danger. If the central government does not swiftly devise a good plan, the situation may escalate.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Soviet Russian Aggression <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Xinjiang has a vast territory and abundant resources, long coveted by the great powers. After Outer Mongolia's defection, Russia focused nearly all its efforts on Xinjiang, first with economic aggression and then with cultural offensives. Other countries such as Turkey, England, and Japan also had plans. When Yang Zengxin was in power, he traded with Russia but strictly prohibited direct transactions between merchants and citizens. All imported goods were handled by the government, which then distributed them to merchants and citizens. The price levels and import quantities were strictly limited, causing great distress to Russia. Now, these restrictions are gradually being relaxed, and foreign goods flood the new province, with low prices. Domestic goods are almost ignored. The loss of economic rights is imminent, and the future is dire. As for the province's education, it is extremely rudimentary. Newspapers are mostly run by Russians. Thinking of this, one cannot help but feel a chill.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Japanese Scheme of Intervention <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The various forms of Soviet Russian aggression are already alarming, but Japan is even more ambitious and aims to intervene. Although its distance makes economic aggression difficult to advance, its intentions are far-reaching, and it has many sinister schemes. In addition to establishing various newspapers in the new province as propaganda tools, it also actively connects with the Hui people to expand its influence in the new province. Recently, it has built a large-scale mosque in Tokyo, granting Japanese people permission to worship Islam to show goodwill. Currently, there are over 250 Hui students studying in Japan. The expansion of Japanese influence in the new province should not be ignored. Furthermore, the Hui people have developed a great aversion to the Russian coercion in Tashkent regarding pig farming, creating a favorable opportunity for the Japanese to advance. The international backdrop of this Hui rebellion is extremely prominent. It is hoped that our government authorities will quickly devise a good rescue plan to prevent a repeat of the Outer Mongolia and Northeast incidents and prevent our great land from falling under the iron hooves of foreign races.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Bai Zili's Conversation <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to Bai Zili (Chief of the Confidential Section of the Newly Compiled Thirty-sixth Division), representative of Ma Zhongying, Ma Zhongying's division has indeed sent troops out of Jiayuguan and stationed them in Anxi, Dunhuang, Yumen, and other counties. It is unclear whether this is to guard against the Hami unrest or to join the Hui-Mongol army in Hami to confront Jin Shuren. However, I received a telegram from Ma Zhongying on the 19th, which did not mention this matter, and it confirmed that Ma himself was still in Suzhou within Jiayuguan and had not left the pass. However, Chairman Ma Hongkui of Ningxia recently gifted our division with wireless telegraphs and multiple machine guns for military use (24th).</p>
<h3 id="e112">Situation After the Defeat of the Jiangxi Bandits <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Chiang to Go North after Completing Military Arrangements</p>
<p>Jiangxi West and South to Be Separately Handled by Hunan and Guangdong</p>
<p>Jiangxi East Military Affairs to Be Completely Commanded by Liu Zhi</p>
<p>A telegram from Nanchang reports that after Chairman Chiang went north the other day, the communist bandits, believing they had an opportunity, came out in full force. Zhu Mao's pseudo-First Front Army, Fang Shao's pseudo-Tenth and Eleventh Armies, Li Tianzhu's pseudo-Eighth Army, Kong Hechong's pseudo-Sixth Army Corps, and various pseudo-guerrilla teams and pseudo-independent divisions, brigades, and battalions, moved towards Nanchang via the Gan River, Fu River, Xin River, attempting to invade the city. Later, Chiang rushed back to Nanchang to take command, driving the bandits out of Qingjiang, Jinxian, Linchuan, and other areas near the provincial capital. Xingan and Dongxiang were gradually recovered, and Yongfeng and Lean were relieved from siege. The bandits were thus thwarted. Currently, the pseudo-First, Third, and Fifth Army Corps of Zhu, Mao, and Peng have all retreated south. Headquarters received a telegram from Chen Cheng, stating that "the pseudo-Third Army Corps has fled from Zhaoxie Shanhe south of Lean, hoping to reach Wangxian, Nancun, and Taipingxu, with a part fleeing to Gugang, intending to attack Yihuang. The pseudo-Fifth Army Corps of Niutian (southern Lean) and Shuinan is moving west. The pseudo-Twentieth Army has fled from Liukeng to Taipingxu, and Luo Binghui's pseudo-Twenty-second Army has fled from Xingan to Tengtian in Yongfeng." As for the recent bandit situation, on the Xin River front, Fang Shao's pseudo-Tenth Army, led by Wang Ruchi, is still in the Yujiang, Wannian, and Yiyang areas, holding onto Zhoufang and Hengfeng. After retreating to Jinxi, the pseudo-Eleventh Army intends to circle around the Fujian border and flee back to Hengfeng. On the Jiangxi West front, after the Hunan Army's Chen and Wang Divisions recovered Lianhua, Yongxin, and Ninggang, Li Tianzhu's pseudo-Eighth Army, in part, fled towards the Yuan River, attempting to join up with Li Tianzhu's troops, while another part fled east, attempting to cross the Gan River and join up with Zhu Mao's troops. The Hunan Army, fearing that the bandits would flee back, has constructed fortifications in the three counties of Lian, Yong, and Ning to defend key areas. On the Jiangxi North front, Kong Hechong's pseudo-Sixth Army Corps repeatedly launched counterattacks on the old nest of Xiaoyuan, but were repelled by the Hunan Army's Peng Weiren Division. These bandits are also trending towards fleeing northeast and are being blocked and suppressed by Tan Dao and Guo Rudong's troops on the Jiangxi-Hubei border. Overall, the situation of bandit suppression is better than before. However, since Chiang's arrival in Jiangxi, the military situation in North China has become increasingly strained. All sides are eagerly awaiting Chiang's trip north. Chiang, seeing that all of Luan East has been lost and that Pingjin is in danger, is also anxiously seeking solutions. In addition to ordering the dispatch of certain units to the front lines, he is also hastily arranging the bandit suppression affairs in the southeast in order to go north. In the past week, a basic framework has been established. Abstractly speaking, the Kong and Li bandits west of the Gan River, bordering Hubei and Hunan, will be completely suppressed by He Jian, who has been appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of Bandit Suppression in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi. Liu Jianxu has been stationed in Pingxiang to command everything. In the Jiangxi South region, the upper reaches of the Gan River above Ji'an will also be suppressed by the Guangdong and Guangxi armies, and there is also a plan for Chen Jitang to take full responsibility for bandit suppression. In the Jiangxi East region, the military affairs of the Fu and Xin Rivers will be completely commanded by Liu Zhi. With the above three routes generally determined, as long as there is coordinated action, the elimination of the communist scourge can be expected soon. Chiang can then let go of the rear and go north to command the anti-Japanese military affairs (April 21).</p>
<h3 id="e113">Groundbreaking Ceremony for the Wuhu-Zhaopu Railway <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Engineering to Be Put Out for Bids Immediately</p>
<p>Survey of the Huainan Railway Completed</p>
<p>A report from Wuhu states that Zhang Jingjiang, General Manager of the Jiangnan Railway Company, along with Manager Pang, Zhang Xiaolin's representative Ma Yingfu, Secretary Zhou Junmei, and engineers from the Construction Committee, traveled from the capital in four cars via the Nanjing-Wuhu Road this morning. At one o'clock in the afternoon, they arrived at the Nanjing-Wuhu bus station. Gao Tie, the Administrative Commissioner of Wuhu, Ma Weilong, the Battalion Commander of the Third Training Battalion, and Mei Fo'an, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, led soldiers, patrol cars, and security teams to welcome them at the station. Many committee members of the Chamber of Commerce and representatives from the education sector also attended. Upon arrival, Zhang was introduced by Hong Shuxing, the Chief Engineer of the Wuhu-Zhaopu Road from the Construction Committee, who shook hands with the welcomers one by one. They then boarded the cars and rested at Puren Hospital. According to Zhang's speech, the Wuhu-Zhaopu Railway is very important to the transportation between Zhejiang and Anhui. It has been decided that the groundbreaking ceremony will be held tomorrow (25th) at 3 PM at the Wuhu Railway Wharf, after which bids will be solicited. Construction will begin soon. It is expected that the section from Wuhu to Sunjiapu can be opened to traffic within ten months, barring any other problems. Seventy passenger and freight cars have already been prepared. It is said that after the groundbreaking ceremony, Zhang will personally inspect the Xuanzhou-Sunjiapu route and then return to Nanjing via Wuhu. Liu Yiwu, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, also rushed to participate in the groundbreaking ceremony. It is also reported that the Huainan Railway, founded by the Jiangnan Railway Company, has now completed its survey and is also preparing to begin construction. The route starts from Bengbu, connects to the Jinpu Railway, passes through Zhengyang along the Bengbu-Hefei Highway to Hefei, and then follows the Hefei-Chaoxian Highway to the Erba Town opposite the Jiang River in Wubu. It will then connect with the Wuhu-Zhaopu Road via ferry. In the future, when all the roads are completed, the rural economy will benefit greatly (April 24).</p>

<p>Huangpu Town in Suzhou was looted by bandits last month, and two people were kidnapped: Xu Yunfan, the owner of a southern goods store, and Sun Xu, the wife of an iron shop owner. At that time, all the shops in the town closed. After persuasion by the District Office, the shops reopened as usual. Subsequently, the river and land police set out to search and suppress the bandits and rescue the kidnap victims. On the 25th, they rescued Xu Yunfan and Sun Xu in the southern Taihu area and seized a bandit boat.</p>

<p>Slight Turnaround in Silk Market Sales</p>
<p>This month, the silk market in this county has been sluggish due to the suspension of foreign firms and the wait-and-see attitude of users. After the United States abolished the gold standard last week, silver prices soared, and Europe and the United States started purchasing actively. Prices suddenly rose by fifty to sixty taels. Foreign firms like Zhenyi Silk Factory and Jinshuangying saw prices of up to six hundred taels. American firms opened at five hundred and sixty taels for eighty-three points of Ivannas. The benchmark silk price on the Japanese Raw Silk Exchange was 850 yen per dan. Therefore, about five hundred dan were traded last week. The price of user silk also rose with the foreign silk market, and trading was not dull.</p>

<p>Zhong Pin of Lanling Township in the Sixteenth District of Wuyi, has usually been disobedient to his birth mother. The other day, he flogged his mother and injured her. Later, Zhong and his wife took advantage of the rain and the unpreparedness of the villagers to push his mother into a ditch next to the village. Villagers heard her cries for help and used long poles to pull her out of the ditch, but she was already barely breathing. It took a long time for her to recover. Madam Xu, who is already in her sixties, could no longer bear it and filed a complaint with the court yesterday, accusing her unfilial son of attempted murder. After examining the wounds and clarifying the situation, the unfilial son will be arrested and interrogated within days.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Land Bureau, in order to facilitate land consolidation and improve facilities, previously ordered the county magistrates of Taicang, Danyang, Wujin, Nantong, Rugao, Nanhui, Songjiang, Jiading, Shanghai, Peixian, Wujiang, Wuxi, Changshu, and other counties to concurrently serve as preparatory members of the County Land Bureau. Now that the county magistrates of the counties have been ordered to transfer their positions, replacements must be appointed in order to take responsibility. Therefore, the newly appointed county magistrates of the counties have been appointed to concurrently serve in the positions, in order to continue operations and facilitate progress.</p>

<p>Dispute Arises over Adding Scheduled Ships</p>
<p>The existing routes between the county and Suzhou are served by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Ltd., with scheduled ships departing in the morning and evening. In the past year, additional mid-day and Huimin Bureau ships have been added, providing great convenience for travelers. Recently, someone has applied to the Construction Department to add early morning ships, departing at 6:30 AM from both locations. Preparations are already in place, and the ships will begin service soon. However, the original China Merchants Steam Navigation Company believes that adding an early morning ship will cause scheduling conflicts and lead to accidents due to competition. Therefore, the manager of the company has applied to the Construction Department to stop the addition of the ships. At the same time, a man named Hu Hezhou has also made a similar application. The Construction Department has submitted the applications to the provincial government, which has instructed the county to investigate and verify.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Letter Received <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor, the news report that an employee of the Kailuan Mining Company had a dispute with a Japanese officer in Changli and subsequently opened fire is completely unfounded, according to a message from the General Manager in Tianjin. Please correct this. Sincerely, Manager of the Kailuan Mining Company, Shanghai Office.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I recently read an article in your newspaper entitled "The Situation in Xinjiang is Becoming Increasingly Serious," which included a statement by Shi Qingyang, a member of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, regarding the Hui rebellion in the new province. A correction is urgently requested. (1) There are approximately 500 naturalized Russian and Japanese residents in the new province. The provincial government has filed a report with the Ministry of the Interior. Among them, no more than 200 are technicians employed by the provincial government. Mr. Shi's statement that the new province has recruited over 3,000 White Russians and formed an army is completely unfounded. (2) Mr. Shi's statement that the provincial authorities have placed eight Hui Kings under house arrest is also untrue. Xinjiang is too far from the mainland, and the rumors are often inaccurate. Mr. Shi may have misunderstandings, and his statements are questionable. However, those who spread rumors and create trouble may exploit Mr. Shi's words, take advantage of the opportunity to create confusion, and plot to undermine the situation on the border. The fact that the Gansu-Xinjiang highway is not open to postal traffic and that mail must be forwarded via Siberia dates back to 1931, when Ma Zhongying disturbed the new province. Although he was later defeated, he still occupied Suzhou, blocking traffic. Therefore, central government agencies often entrusted our office to forward documents to Xinjiang via Russia. This has been going on for two years, not just recently. The main reason for this Hui rebellion in the new province is Ma Zhongying's agitation, with the aim of occupying the northwest and sowing discord among the ethnic groups. The two reasons cited by Mr. Shi are inconsistent with the facts. The central government has decided to appoint a senior official to inspect the Hui rebellion in Xinjiang soon. The truth will be clearly revealed. Please publish this letter to avoid misleading the public. Sincerely, Xinjiang Provincial Government Office in Beijing. April 25.</p>

<p>Will Return to Shanghai After Staying in Beijing for a Few Days</p>
<p>Soviet Russian Ambassador to China Bogomolov, accompanied by Counselor Baikoff and others from the embassy, a total of five people, took a specially prepared train car on the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) Railway to Beijing at 9:25 yesterday morning to visit the various authorities of the National Government and to discuss the date for presenting his credentials with Foreign Minister Luo. Bogomolov will stay in Beijing for at most two or three days and then return to Shanghai.

<p>Soviet Russian Ambassador Bogomolov and his party of more than ten people arrived at the North Station at 9:10 yesterday morning in two cars provided by the Soviet Embassy in Shanghai on Xinzha Road. They were then led to the platform and boarded the train car by Chief Zhao of the Foreign Affairs Office and receptionists from the Railway Bureau.

<p>A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency also boarded the train car and met with the Soviet Russian Ambassador. Bogomolov was wearing a dark gray suit and had a pleasant smile on his face as he shook hands with the reporter. Reporter: When will you return to Shanghai from this trip to Beijing? Ambassador: This trip to Beijing is purely to visit Foreign Minister Luo and discuss the date for presenting my credentials. I will return to Shanghai in a few days and then go to Beijing again to present my credentials according to the procedure. Reporter: Will you go to Beiping (Beijing) for this trip? Ambassador: I plan to be stationed permanently in Beijing and Shanghai and will not go to Beiping for the time being. Reporter: Has a decision been made on the selection of consuls general for your country in various locations? Ambassador: The selection of consuls will be the responsibility of the Consular Department of the embassy in the future and will be officially announced after I present my credentials. Reporter: Is it true that Director Angeski of the Consular Department will also serve as Consul General in Beijing? Ambassador: Perhaps. The Consul General in Shanghai is still en route to China. Reporter: Are you planning to establish consulates in other places besides Nanjing and Shanghai? Ambassador: We plan to establish consulates in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Tianjin. As there is no immediate need for other locations such as Beiping, Hankou, and Guangzhou, it has been decided not to establish consulates there.</p>
<h3 id="e129">First Envoy <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Since the National Government revoked recognition of the Russian Embassy in China in December 1927, relations had been in a state of change. In July 1929, war broke out over the Middle East Railway incident, and diplomatic relations between the two countries were completely severed. On December 12, 1932, diplomatic relations were restored when our representative Yan Huiqing and Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov exchanged documents in Geneva. This lasted for five years. This is the first time that a formal Soviet envoy has entered Beijing since the establishment of the National Government. Although Borodin and Galen were stationed in Guangzhou when the National Government was established in Guangdong, they were employed by the government and were not envoys.</p>

<h3 id="e131">Shanghai Municipal Council Held a Board Meeting Yesterday, Chinese Directors Opposed Inspection of Factories in the Concession <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Because They Had Not Received Notification from the Consular Body</p>
<p>The Matter Was Temporarily Postponed for Discussion</p>
<h3 id="e132">Municipal Government Declares It Will Not Give Up the Entire Labor Administrative Power <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Public Concession Ratepayers Meeting's passage of the amendment to Article 34 of the by-laws of the Foreign Mixed Court's Land Regulations, regarding the management of factories in the concession, is not only an overreach of authority but also a destruction of our country's sovereignty, a division of our country's laws, and a violation of international law. The Shanghai Municipal Government has declared its resolute opposition to this kind of excessive expansion of authority. The Chinese ratepayers in the Public Concession have also united to argue their case on the basis of reason. The Shanghai Municipal Council held a board meeting at 5:00 PM yesterday. All the Chinese directors raised a statement opposing the amendment to Article 34 of the by-laws. Because the Municipal Council had not yet received notification from the Consular Body regarding this matter, it was decided to postpone the discussion temporarily. It was only after the Municipal Council received notification from the leader of the consular body that the matter would be brought up for discussion again. According to Mayor Wu, in a conversation with a Central News Agency reporter yesterday, the municipal government is firmly opposed to this matter and will not give up the entire labor administrative power of the Chinese government.</p>

<p>Shang Commander-in-Chief and Weng Division Commander, Luanzhou division, greetings. We read in the newspapers yesterday that our army is launching a counteroffensive on all fronts and that your units are crossing the river and advancing bravely. The news of the recapture of Qian and Lu has been welcomed by all. We send this telegram to congratulate you and to express our sincere gratitude. Now that the suffering of the enemy is deep, everything depends on the gentlemen at the front lines to be brave and advance. Defending will never lead to victory; counterattacking will surely establish great merit. This campaign is a clear proof of that. We hope that you will continue to persevere and actively advance. Our association pledges to be your support. The Northeast Righteous Army Support Association, bowing,</p>

<p>Sent to the 41st Army Office in Beiping to forward to Sun Commander Dianying. The Japanese invaders are insatiable in their greed. Your army's patriotic fervor has moved you to assist Rehe. After fighting for two months, you have repeatedly defeated the enemy's offensive. We have heard that you have recaptured Fengning, which the people of the country deeply rejoice over. At a time when our army is launching a counteroffensive on all fronts and making progress on all routes, your army should seize the opportunity to advance directly to Chengde. Opportunities are hard to come by. We eagerly await the good news. The army blankets, raincoats, and cotton clothing that our association previously donated have arrived at the military sub-association. The additional 5,000 yuan in comfort funds that have been allocated have been used to purchase 1,260 dozen pairs of galoshes, which will be transported to Beiping by the Military Commission for forwarding. This information is hereby reported. We pray for your consideration. The Northeast Righteous Army Support Association, bowing,</p>

<p>Demanding Exemption from Land Requisition</p>
<p>The Shanghai West Caojing District Municipal Committee Office recently issued a notice stating that it had been ordered to expand the Longhua Airport, requiring the relocation of more than 30 acres of cemetery land in the area within two weeks, or it would be forcibly leveled. This caused panic among the landowners being expropriated. Yesterday morning, they sent representatives Tang Muquan, Tang Xiuchang, Wang Dianchen, Shi Bocun, and others, more than ten people in all, to the municipal government to petition. They were received by Dai Jiagu, a staff member of the Second Section. The petition representatives stated that the airport requisition was unnecessary because the military training ground of more than 100 acres in the middle of the area could be expanded. Now, they are requisitioning cemetery land. They requested that measures be taken to stop this. Mr. Dai said that he would accept the petition and forward it to the mayor for review. They then went to the municipal party headquarters to petition, where they were received by Dai Youheng of the Civil Movement Section. After inquiring about the details, he promised to investigate the facts and handle the matter jointly with the municipal government. They also went to the municipal farmers association to petition, requesting assistance.</p>

<p>The China National Aviation Corporation dispatched Huang Bao Xian, director of the company's business division, to Sichuan to negotiate matters concerning the Chongqing-Chengdu section of the Shanghai-Chengdu route. After the negotiation and progress, everything is basically in order, and the obstacles that existed before the Sichuan war are no longer a problem. Mr. Huang's mission has been successfully completed, and he will depart from Chongqing today to return to Shanghai. The company will wait for his report upon his return to Shanghai and then proceed to dispatch personnel for test flights. Reports stating that he arrived in Hankou yesterday and will arrive in Shanghai today are inaccurate. According to company sources, the company's expansion of the Longhua Airport is being handled by personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Communications in Shanghai, together with the municipal government. The acquisition of civilian land will also be done by the company at a favorable price. The expansion will be approximately 40% wider than the original. As for the talk of Sino-American aviation, it is not yet possible because the domestic routes have not been fully completed.</p>

<p>Cai Yuanpei's Letter to Wang Jingwei: "Dear Mr. Jingwei, Luo Zhanglong, a student of Peking University, was recently arrested at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Library on suspicion of being a Communist. He is currently detained at the Municipal Public Security Bureau. The lawyer requested by the Civil Rights League to visit him was told by the Public Security Bureau that the case was serious and was not allowed to see him. Luo was expelled by Communist cadres in the 18th year due to political disagreements. In recent years, he has devoted himself to writing, completing a 1.2 million-word History of Chinese Industry. I have seen the manuscript, and it is a vast collection and a great work of Chinese economic history. For the past two years, his time and energy in Shanghai have been spent mostly in various libraries, and the location of his arrest was also at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Library. It does not seem appropriate to harm him with the crime of endangering the Republic of China based on reports from informants who were once Communists. I hope that you will order the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to release Mr. Luo Zhanglong immediately, or transfer him to the Shanghai Local Court for a public trial. Respectfully, Cai Yuanpei."</p>
<h3 id="e144">Health Bureau Prevents Epidemics <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Organizing Cholera Vaccination Teams</p>
<p>Scheduled to Start on May 1st</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Municipal Health Bureau, recognizing that epidemics such as cholera are prevalent in summer and autumn, posing a significant threat, is organizing cholera vaccination teams to protect the health of citizens and prevent infection. The program is scheduled to start on May 1st. Due to the increasing population density in the urban area, in addition to actively preparing to establish municipal hospitals, it will also take over the China Public Hospital. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Preparing to Establish Municipal Hospitals: The funding for municipal hospitals has long been approved by the municipal government. The location has been decided in the central area of the city, with a site of over 87 mu. Mayor Wu Tiecheng, recognizing that the establishment of municipal hospitals is a matter of urgency, has decided to allocate 400,000 yuan within the year. Therefore, the Health Bureau has drafted the hospital building styles and internal layout plans and plans to start construction in March of next year.</p>
<p>▲ Taking Over the Public Hospital: The China Public Hospital on Tongji Road in Zhabei was founded by Guangdong native Chen Bingqian and others and has a considerable history. It was almost completely destroyed during the Songhu War. Although efforts were made to restore it, it never regained its former glory. The bureau is eager to establish an isolation hospital in the Zhabei area to benefit the citizens. The hospital also intends to transfer it to the Municipal Health Bureau for takeover. Therefore, the Health Bureau is very willing to take it over. However, the hospital's annual expenses require about 60,000 yuan, and its income is only 10,000 yuan from the Junpu Bureau wharf donation. Therefore, the annual expenses after the takeover still need to be planned.</p>
<p>▲ Preventing Cholera: The bureau is organizing cholera vaccination teams to prevent cholera, advising citizens to get vaccinated to prevent disease. Its announcement states: "For the matter of announcement, cholera is a prevalent disease in summer and autumn, posing a significant threat. In order to maintain the health of citizens and prevent epidemics, we have organized cholera vaccination teams to provide vaccinations. This has been promoted for many years, and many citizens believe in it, but there are also many confused people who are unwilling to receive vaccinations. We have decided to start preventive vaccinations on May 1st and set up branches widely to achieve universality. All citizens should receive vaccinations to increase the body's resistance and protect individual health and social security. Whether individuals or groups, those who wish to be vaccinated can go directly to the branch or come to the bureau. Groups of more than 30 people can write to the bureau to request personnel for vaccination, all free of charge. Let all know."</p>

<h3 id="e147">Astronomical Telescope Shipped from Germany to Beijing <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>China has a long history of research in astronomy. The Nanjing Qintianshan Meteorological Observatory has a history of 1,500 years. Recently, the Academia Sinica has paid particular attention and will build a very large observatory on Zijin Mountain. Its main astronomical work is the relationship between world meridians, solar activity, and continental magnetism, as well as the changes in short-term constellations. The establishment of the Nanjing Observatory is the initiative of the Far East and leads all parties to cooperate with the world in research. The astronomical telescope recently purchased by the Academia Sinica from the German Zeiss factory is a reflecting telescope. The lower part of the telescope tube has a silver-plated parabolic reflector with a diameter of 24 inches and a focal length of 16 feet. The front part of the telescope tube has a small flat reflector placed at 45 degrees to the optical axis. The image of such a large mirror is reflected laterally, allowing for direct observation. Secondly, a similar convex lens can be used instead of the flat reflector, allowing the image to be emitted from the central hole to the observation point behind the large mirror, which is the lower part of the telescope tube. The focal length of the reflector system is 33 feet. Next to the large telescope tube, and parallel to it, is a smaller telescope with an 8-inch lens and a 10-foot focal length. This auxiliary mirror is still used to observe constellations when the large telescope tube is taking photographic exposures. There is also a specially made movable table and chair that uses electric machinery to move simultaneously with the celestial body. It has extremely precise machine buttons and everything else, operated entirely by electricity, accurate and ingenious, unparalleled. At the same time, it can be used by many people to observe celestial phenomena. It is the most advanced astronomical telescope in the world and the only one in the Far East, worth more than 120,000 marks. The large mirror is specially designed to capture images of celestial bodies and spectroscopic records. It has now been shipped to Beijing and can be used once the Zijin Mountain Observatory is completed. In addition to the telescope, the Academia Sinica has also widely placed many other astronomical instruments, such as an 8-inch equatorial reflector, a 6-inch astronomical camera, also manufactured by the German Zeiss factory, a 5.5-inch meridian gauge with an automatic micrometer, produced by Societe Genevoise, a 4-inch Ross camera with equatorial mount, produced by Lundin &amp; Harvard, a spectroscopic astronomical mirror, produced by Mount Wilson, a Shortt non-pendulum clock, produced by Riefler, several low-power telescopes, and accessories, all sold by the local resident general manager of the factory, Rehe Yangxing. The picture on the right shows Minister Liu Wendao visiting the factory and taking pictures.</p>

<p>Dispatched to Various Countries for On-Site Study of Postal Services</p>
<p>In order to improve China's postal service, the Ministry of Communications decided to select five postal workers from across the country and dispatch them to countries such as the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, France, Italy, and Russia to study the achievements of postal services in various countries on-site, so as to serve as a basis for future reforms. Yesterday, the Postal Administration has issued orders to local post offices, requiring postal workers above the second grade and fourth class to participate in the examination. The test questions will be sent by the Postal Administration to local post offices. It is reported that postal workers participating in the examination must be proficient in at least two languages. Postal workers selected by local post offices still need to gather in Shanghai for a retest, which will be handled by the Shanghai Postal Administration. The most outstanding will be selected, and then sent to Beijing for an oral examination by personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Communications. As a result, only five people were selected. They will first inspect the various departments of the Postal Administration for 40 days, so that they can first understand the current situation of domestic postal services. After the inspection, they will take a ship and go abroad to study in various countries, and are scheduled to return to China after six months. Currently, local post offices that have received the Postal Administration's order have begun preparing for the examination.</p>

<p>The Chamber of Commerce and Others Urged Action in a Letter Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the National Society, the Nanjing Road Merchants' Association and the First Branch of the Citizens' Association have repeatedly notified the stores on Nanjing Road to quickly go to the association to fill out voluntary forms promising not to sell inferior goods, in order to encourage merchants to love the country and protect the safety of stores. However, after receiving this notice, many of the stores on the road went to fill out the voluntary forms promising not to sell inferior goods, but there were also not a few who turned a blind eye and did not fill them out. Therefore, the two associations jointly sent a letter yesterday notifying the stores that had not filled out the forms. The original letter stated: "(Respected Sirs, This association has repeatedly notified the stores on this road to quickly come to the association to fill out voluntary forms promising not to sell inferior goods, in order to encourage merchants to love the country and protect the safety of stores, so that this association and others can jointly issue a certificate card. However, your store has not expressed any intention so far. We are sending a special letter as a final notice. Please give a reply before April 30, otherwise, when the major newspapers are officially announced, your store will be listed as uncertified, which will affect your store's reputation and business. If your store specializes in selling domestic goods, this association intends to make a separate certificate card (specializing in selling domestic goods) for issuance, and we hope you will write a letter to claim it.)"

<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession, based on a letter from the Gongping Accountants and Lawyers Office, requested the Public Works Department to correct the overestimation of rent, which led to the donation rate exceeding the original amount, and requested that it not be paid in order to protect legal benefits. The original letter is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e155">Letter to the Public Works Department <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>"(Respected Sirs, According to a letter from the Gongping Accountants and Lawyers Office on the seventh floor of No. 6 Sichuan Road, the concession housing donation is collected at 14% of the rent. Our office has also handled it in the same way for many years, and we have been at peace with each other. However, we recently received a donation ticket from the Donation Office, which has arbitrarily increased it from 58 taels and 2 qian to 63 taels, 5 qian, and 6 fen. It is reported that the housing donation of the neighboring house has also increased at the same time. Such arbitrary estimation and addition, without any standard, is very unfair. We should ask your association to strongly negotiate and order to maintain the status quo to protect the rights of citizens. The donation of municipal revenue should be based on the actual rent as the standard. No matter what, in law and in fact, there is no room for change. Otherwise, although it is proclaimed to the public that donations will not be increased, the budget is passed, and taxes are not increased, the actual increase in donations is increasing day by day, becoming a kind of insincere and unexplained behavior. The rent for the office is 1,644 taels and 1 qian and 4 fen per year, including the water and wharfage fee. However, last year's donation ticket was counted as 1,672 taels and 1 qian. Even if the water and wharfage fee is not removed, it is 27 taels and 8 qian and 6 fen higher than the actual rent. The taxpayer has already borne 3 taels and 9 qian more than the obligation outside the law throughout the year. This year, it is 171 taels and 8 qian and 6 fen higher than the actual rent, and he wants to bear 24 taels and 6 qian of non-obligatory expenses every year. According to the donation rate, it is not 14%, but more than 15%. According to the letter, we should send a letter to your bureau asking you to correct it as soon as possible. This is to the General Office of the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department."</p>

<p>"(Respected Sirs, I have received your letter of April 21 regarding the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department's assessment of rent and collection of donations, which I have fully understood. The Public Works Department collects donations, and if there is an actual rent that can be used as a standard, it should be calculated based on the actual rent. Otherwise, arbitrarily estimating the rent rate, although it is still 14%, the actual increase in donations is an act of increasing donations. Your office's actual rent is 1,644 taels and 2 qian and 4 fen per year, and the water and wharfage fee must be removed. However, the bureau has already occupied 27 taels and 8 qian and 6 fen higher than the actual rent last year, causing your office to bear 3 taels and 9 qian of non-obligatory expenses. The overestimation this year is 171 taels and 8 qian and 6 fen, and you have to pay 24 taels and 6 qian more per year. The donation rate has been increased to more than 15%. You should not pay it to protect legal benefits and to protect the rule of law of the Public Works Department. We should reply to you for your reference. Gongping Accountants and Lawyers Office."</p>

<p>Waiting for Water and Electricity to be Fully Connected</p>
<p>The strike by the bicycle repair industry in the French Concession against increased special donations has been mediated and compromised. However, because the water and electricity companies had not received notice from the French Municipal Council, the water and electricity lines had not yet been fully connected. Therefore, the industry had not fully resumed business. Yesterday, more than 40 industry representatives continued to hold their fifth general meeting at the Trade Association at 2 p.m. They elected Xu Ruoyu, Han Baotai, and Ji Mingnian as chairmen. The chairmen first reported on the process of contacting Cheng Zhusun, chairman of the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the French Concession, to resolve the issue. Everyone expressed satisfaction. The following solutions were then discussed: (1) Fully accept and express satisfaction with all aspects of the solution; (2) Regarding the resumption of business, because some have not yet had their water and electricity lines connected, everyone will resume business after full connection; (3) Send letters to the French authorities and the Chinese Ratepayers Association expressing satisfaction and gratitude; (4) Send documents or replies to various agencies and groups, stating that the issue of levy collection has been resolved and cease negotiations; (5) Send letters of gratitude to various groups and individuals who have assisted in upholding fairness; (6) Schedule a public banquet to thank representatives from all walks of life; (7) Expenses to be shared by all members; (8) The French Concession office will be closed after full resumption of business.

<p>Chai Yanxu, son of wealthy merchant Chai Bingsheng, filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court against Pan Xiangsheng (owner of Panhe Maoxiangji Lake Crepe Shop), his uncle by marriage, and Ji Zhongren (resident of Hou Zai Li on Baker Road, formerly silk manager at Shenchang Foreign Firm) for encroaching on a large amount of property and refusing to hand it over. Jiang Yiping, Qin Liankui, and Yang Zhihao were hired as three lawyers in the case. After several court sessions, which have been reported in this newspaper, the defendants requested reconciliation at the last hearing (the eleventh of this month). Judge Liu instructed that the case be postponed for two weeks. Yesterday was the date of the continued hearing. Lawyer Jiang stated that although the defendants' lawyer sent someone to the law firm this morning to request reconciliation, due to the short timeframe and the hearing date, they requested another postponement of several days to facilitate reconciliation. If reconciliation is not possible within several days, they requested that a special court session be held to conclude the trial, as the case had already been heard four times. Judge Liu earnestly instructed the two defendants, Pan Xiangsheng and Ji Zhongren, that they were close relatives of the plaintiff, and should return the property they had encroached on. The court ruled to allow a postponement to facilitate reconciliation outside of court.</p>

<p>The troops of General Song Zheyuan of the 29th Army fought a bloody battle at Xifengkou Luowenyu and Saheqiao, killing tens of thousands of enemies. The news of the victory boosted the morale of the whole country. However, the defense area was vast and transportation was difficult. Shanghai gentleman Du Yuesheng specially ordered four Buick trucks from the American Buick Motor Company and generously donated them to General Song's army. General Song telegraphed his thanks yesterday. The Guangdong Compatriots Relief Association also donated a Horsch truck, which was handed over to Song's representatives Xiao Zhenying and Sun Longji for transportation to the front.

<h3 id="e170">Traditional Chinese Medicine Groups Oppose Fee Collection on Prescriptions <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Jointly Petitioned the Municipal Party Headquarters to Stop It Yesterday</p>
<p>Legitimacy of Traditional Chinese Medicine Depends Entirely on Payment</p>
<p>Violates the Declaration Exempting Taxes and Miscellaneous Levies</p>
<p>The Shanghai Traditional Chinese Medicine Association, the Traditional Chinese Medicine Society, and the All-China Traditional Chinese Medicine Society, along with all executive supervisors, filed a petition to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Headquarters regarding the Shanghai branch of the National Traditional Chinese Medicine Hall collecting fees per prescription, requesting that they immediately stop it nearby, and forward it to the Central Party Headquarters to consult the Executive Yuan to order the Hall to cancel it. The petition concerned the Shanghai branch of the Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Hall illegally levying fees per prescription from Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners. It requested investigation and approval, earnestly requesting immediate stoppage nearby, and forwarding it to the Central Party Headquarters to consult the Executive Yuan to order the Hall to cancel it. The association stated that it received a letter from the Shanghai branch of the National Traditional Chinese Medicine Hall on March 25 of this year, stating that all prescriptions used by Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners practicing in the city should be submitted to the Traditional Chinese Medicine branch for stamping and pay a branch fee of one dollar, and that the payment rules for medical prescriptions were distributed to the association. After the announcement, the association's members believed that the branch's collection of fees per prescription was a form of taxation, which had no legal basis, was excessively detailed, and was difficult to implement. After conveying this to the branch, the branch director Lu Zhong'an disregarded public opinion and insisted on his own way. The Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Hall is an organization to assist in the development of Chinese medicine, and is absolutely a medical and health organization. The significance is stated in the first article of the organizational charter of the Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Hall. The branches in various provinces and cities are subordinate institutions, and their nature should not be different. The acquisition of its funds should first request the local government to allocate subsidies, and if it is insufficient, then the branch board of directors may raise funds. The collection of these funds is the duty of the branch board of directors, not the right of the Traditional Chinese Medicine branch. Therefore, it can only be persuaded by the board of directors to help with expenses. To levy it in the name of the branch and enforce it by force is illegal. Its own organization is only responsible for organizing academics and does not have any administrative power. The regulations are clear and do not allow distortion. Branch director Lu Zhong'an has neither applied to the local government for subsidies in accordance with the law (according to the original letter from the branch) nor announced a budget. How can he know in advance that the subsidy will be insufficient in the future, and levy taxes without fear of distorting the law and openly suppressing it? According to the regulations on the exercise of governance promulgated by the National Government on July 10, 1929, even if the branch is indeed an administrative agency, it may not independently formulate and implement it. According to Article 6 of the branch's payment rules for medical prescriptions, pharmacies will recognize physicians that have the branch's seal as legitimate Chinese medicine physicians, and dispense medicine according to the prescription. Otherwise, it will be considered a violation of the rules. That is, Traditional Chinese Medicine practitioners who are recognized as legitimate and licensed by the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau can be given the name of illegitimate Chinese medicine practitioners simply by not paying one cent of expenses. Furthermore, according to Article 9 of the rules, prescriptions written by patients themselves without the name and seal of a physician are not subject to this restriction, which is tantamount to organizing the agency of Traditional Chinese Medicine and assisting in the popularization of divining prescriptions and immortal prescriptions, secretly cultivating superstitious psychology among the people. All of this not only disrupts the administrative system, but also openly violates the declaration of the National Government in 1928 exempting miscellaneous taxes and levies, as well as the intention of the Ministry to eliminate injustice and protect the lives of the people. It is extremely illegal and beyond authority. The Central National Traditional Chinese Medicine Hall did not examine the situation and correct it. I hope that the Ministry will be concerned about the people's grievances and see far and wide. In addition to filing a complaint with the Executive Yuan in accordance with the law, we should jointly file a petition for investigation and approval, and earnestly request that the illegal original order be immediately stopped nearby, and forwarded to the Central Party Headquarters, and consult the Executive Yuan, to order the Hall to cancel the illegal original order, which would be a great kindness.</p>

<p>Unforeseen Disaster, Brother Dies, Brother Injured</p>
<p>Yuchenghe Fur Shop, No. 112 Jixiang Lane, Jixiang Street, French Concession, has been in business for more than 30 years and has developed quite well. At around 7 p.m. last night, just after the shop had finished dinner, two customers from Zhenjiang, Tang Jingen (36 years old) and Tang Jinbiao (27 years old), brothers, suddenly arrived to inquire whether a batch of goods shipped from Tianjin had arrived in Shanghai. However, just as the Tang brothers sat down and the tea boy was serving tea, three robbers broke in from outside the door. One was wearing a white-gray robe and two were wearing black gowns. All were around 30 years old. One of the robbers, speaking imperfect Shanghai dialect, first asked if the surname was Wen and if they had come here. At that time, Tang Jingen felt that the three men were flustered and their actions were erratic, and remembered that they were definitely not good people. He wanted to get up and close the door. Seeing that the situation was not good, the three robbers turned around and ran out, trying to escape. The Tang brothers followed and chased them out, shouting for the capture of robbers. When they chased to the entrance of Jixiang Lane, No. 120, in front of the Mori Yuen Hing glass shop, one of the robbers turned around and fired three shots at the Tang brothers. Jingen was shot in the chest and fell to the ground. Jinbiao was shot in the right arm. When nearby detectives heard the alarm and rushed to the scene, the three robbers had already disappeared. The detectives were dispatched by the police station to send the Tang brothers to Renji Hospital. Jingen died in the hospital at 8:10 p.m. due to serious injuries. Jinbiao was not seriously injured. The hospital notified the police station, which in turn instructed the Tongren Fuyuan branch to send undertakers to carry Jingen's body to the autopsy room, and report to the Second Special District Court tomorrow for a gun examination.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, a Chinese Policeman = British Soldier, Comrades Kill Each Other</p>
<p>Both Use Poisonous Hands Due to Grievances and Revenge</p>
<p>Chinese and British Killers Both Commit Suicide in Fear of Punishment</p>
<h3 id="e173">Chinese Policeman Shoots and Kills Police Chief <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Song Huchen, from Feicheng County, Shandong Province, was 38 years old and lived on Haifang Road, Gordon Road, West Shanghai. He was the Chinese policeman No. 322 in the third patrol of the Disraeli Road police station in the Public Concession. At around 11 a.m. yesterday, as it was the time for the Chinese policemen to change shifts, Song led more than a dozen Chinese policemen to the team from the police station. When they approached No. 1408 Disraeli Road near North Sichuan Road, a Chinese policeman No. 1889 in the team suddenly shouted, "Slow down, Song!" When Song looked back and was about to question him, the Chinese policeman No. 1889 had already pulled out the pistol provided by his superior, secretly loaded a bullet, and fired four shots at Song, all hitting vital points. Song still hoped to escape and ran forward with all his strength, to the entrance of Changxing Laundry, No. 1410, at the intersection of Disraeli Road and North Sichuan Road, and finally fell to the ground due to exhaustion. Seeing this, the other Chinese policemen in the team quickly surrounded the Chinese policeman who had committed the crime. In desperation, the policeman turned his hand and fired a shot at his own head, and fell to the ground. Seeing that the disaster was expanding, the policemen quickly returned to the police station to report, and sent the injured police chief and the Chinese policeman who committed the crime to the Municipal Council Hospital on Ward Road for treatment. However, both died of their injuries on the way. The two bodies were then sent to the Phalen Road autopsy room to be reported to the court for examination. After investigation, reporters learned that the cause of this disaster was actually due to the fact that at around 7 p.m. on the 24th, when Song was patrolling near Disraeli Road, he saw that the policeman No. 1889 was not on duty. After inquiring, he learned that the policeman had entrusted his attendance diary to a nearby police officer, and then went to gamble nearby. Song found him at the gambling place and reported it to the police chief. After discussion by the superiors, the policeman was demoted. The announcement was posted at 10 a.m. yesterday morning. When the policeman No. 1889 saw it, he harbored resentment and plotted revenge, but he did not expect that he would take such a poisonous hand. Song's family only left behind a wife and a daughter, and his death was very sad. The Chinese policeman No. 1889 who committed the crime was named Li Chunhe, from Tianjin. At the same time, the police station was very saddened by the fact that policeman Song was killed due to a public grievance, and was planning for the aftermath.</p>
<h3 id="e174">British Soldier Shoots and Wounds Officer <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>According to the North China Daily News, a British duty soldier, Glover, shot and wounded an officer in the YMCA shack near the Jiaozhou Road barracks yesterday morning and threatened the soldiers of the regiment, preventing them from approaching. When detectives tricked him into being arrested, he shot himself and died in the British Military Hospital on Central Road. The British police court sent someone to examine the body yesterday afternoon and scheduled a trial for Saturday. When the case occurred, the vicinity of the Jiaozhou Road barracks was greatly shaken, and the British community regarded it as an unusual event. Several people tried to persuade him to release the gun and surrender, but Glover did not listen. The details of the case suggest that there may have been unexpected grievances. It is believed that the truth will come out after the trial. According to the report, Glover was a young soldier, only 26 years old, who had only been in Shanghai for over a year. He is currently assigned to the Second Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment of the British Army. He was assigned to the British Miqin team to escort cars, so he received a pistol and six bullets every day when he went from the Jiaozhou Road barracks to the car parking lot. As usual, he went to the duty team barracks with a gun to serve on a car yesterday morning. At 10 a.m., the car went out, but Gray could not be found. He called the military lawyer of the Jiaozhou Road barracks, Pinard, and began searching. It is said that Glover had been summoned to Pinard's office for reprimand for violating the rules, but it seemed that there was no hard feeling afterward. Later, when Pinard found the YMCA shack, Glover saw him approaching and knew that the purpose was himself. He immediately opened fire, wounding Pinard's right hand. Pinard then withdrew and called other soldiers to assist. The staff of the YMCA also went to persuade him, but all were ineffective. A few minutes later, Glover saw that the British soldiers had surrounded the outside of the shack and fired two more shots. As Glover had no way to escape and the other soldiers did not want to be targets, they had no intention of entering to arrest him, and a stalemate was formed. Later, the authorities decided to ask the patrol to assist and called the Gordon Road police station. At around 11 a.m., a Western detective in a bulletproof vest rushed to the scene, walked into the shack, and persuaded Glover to release the gun and surrender. He was about to achieve his goal when Glover suddenly aimed the muzzle at his forehead and pulled the trigger, committing suicide. However, he did not die at the time. It was not until 12:30 p.m. that he was sent to the British Military Hospital on Central Road, and he died at 1:10 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Friend Inside, Husband Blocked Outside <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Liu Suqin's Romance Is Evident</p>
<p>Wife Elopes at Night, Husband Sues Mother-in-Law</p>
<p>Fu Shiyan, from Anhui, was serving in the military. His wife, Liu Suqin, is the daughter of Liu Wangshi from Jiangbei, currently 31 years old. She has been married to Fu for eight years and has three children, both sons and daughters. They originally lived in Dingfeng Lane, Fujian Road. Last winter, because Fu's friend was working in Hunan Province, Fu also went to Hunan on October 16th to seek employment. He frequently entrusted household affairs to his mother-in-law, Liu Wangshi, for care. Shortly after, his venture failed, and he returned to Shanghai on November 19th of the lunar calendar. Unexpectedly, upon arriving home, his wife and children were nowhere to be found. He inquired of the neighbors and learned that after he left, his wife, instigated by her mother, had completely changed her behavior. She had mingled with prostitutes, turning the home into a brothel and using the residence as a temporary meeting place, which led to the landlord's disapproval and eviction. Therefore, she had moved to the remaining rooms of Dasheng Hospital near Sanma Road and Yunnan Road. Fu immediately rushed there to find her. According to a Dr. Yi at the hospital, although there had been tenants recently, none were named Fu, but they had heard the surname Zhang. At this moment, a maid came downstairs. Fu recognized her as the one he had hired before he left. Believing that a breakthrough was possible, he decided to ascend the stairs, hoping to have a heartfelt conversation with his wife, whom he was apart from. Unexpectedly, the maid physically blocked him, preventing him from entering the room. At that time, Liu Suqin also emerged from the room, looking drowsy with her robe half-undone. Seeing this, Fu suspected she had just woken up from a daytime nap. He questioned her about the reason for preventing him from entering. The woman said that a friend was inside and it was inconvenient for him to see. Fu listened to her words and observed the movements inside the room. In an instant, he suddenly saw a man wearing an overcoat escape from the window. By the time Fu rushed into the room, he was long gone. Fu then severely scolded his wife, and the sounds of his reproaches did not cease until midnight. That very night, Liu Suqin abandoned her children, left the house alone, and disappeared without a trace. Fu, believing that his wife's departure was due to his mother-in-law's instigation, filed a criminal complaint of interference with marriage against Liu Wangshi. The First Special District Court has already issued a summons for a hearing. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui continued the trial. After the plaintiff, Fu Shiyan, described the circumstances of the case, he also stated that the defendant escaped that night while he was out bathing and that all his valuables and clothes were taken away. He also stated that his marriage with Liu Suqin had been arranged through a matchmaker and that a marriage certificate existed. Dr. Yi was also brought to court to testify about Liu Suqin renting the room from him, saying that he did not know her background since she only lived there for five days. When questioned, the defendant, Liu Wangshi, claimed ignorance of the charges, saying that her daughter had eloped with Fu. She added that now that a formal son-in-law had taken her daughter away, it had nothing to do with her, and that her daughter was already in court. Liu Suqin also confessed to eloping and denied being a prostitute while Fu was away, as well as denying any theft this time. The judge, deeming further investigation necessary, adjourned the hearing.</p>

<p>Friend Wightman Threatens with a Gun</p>
<p>Davis' Quick Thinking Saves the Day</p>
<h3 id="e177">English Police Court Hearing Yesterday <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Ta Mei Wan Pao reports that Englishman Wightman, accused of breaking into the home of Davis, Managing Director of the North China Daily News, and threatening him with a gun, was heard again in the English Police Court this morning (26th). Lawyer Livingstone, who had represented Davis and the police on Monday, stated that he was unable to continue due to other matters and was replaced by Mustard. Mustard then read the original charge, adding two more counts: one for assaulting Davis and one for intending to injure Davis with a gun. Mustard elaborated on the case, saying that the defendant and Davis had known each other for many years and had a good relationship. Before Christmas last year, the defendant visited, and after Davis came out to see him, the defendant behaved rudely, showing a section of the North China Daily News commentary from December 16th, pointing out hidden satire and insinuations against the defendant, and making threatening remarks, demanding satisfaction. In fact, the defendant's accusations were completely imaginary and unfounded. Davis explained this, and the defendant seemed quite satisfied and left. Not long after, the defendant visited again, asking for help in finding a job. Davis told him he would keep an eye out. The defendant left happily again. Then, the day before the incident, which was the 21st of this month at 8 a.m., the defendant visited Davis again. Previously, the defendant had visited Davis three times, but he was not in. This morning, when he saw Davis, he spoke quite aggressively, took out a document, and asked Davis to sign it. Davis read it over once but did not understand it very well and refused to sign. According to what Davis had learned, the defendant was suffering from a mental illness at the time. Although there was a slight dispute, Davis still comforted him and told him to leave. At 8:30 p.m. that evening, he came again, but Davis told him that he had a banquet to attend and left. The next morning at 5:45 a.m., Davis was awakened by the sound of footsteps and saw the defendant approaching his bed, followed by a servant. The defendant took out another document and threatened loudly, saying that if Davis did not sign it, he would blow up the whole house. He also took out a revolver and pointed it at Davis' head, only inches away, threatening to shoot if he did not sign. Davis, just awakened from his dream, took the paper and glanced at it. He picked up a pencil from the table beside the bed and pretended to sign, hoping to take the opportunity to seize the gun. Then he said that he should sign with a fountain pen and asked the defendant if he had one. The defendant was about to untie the buttons of his raincoat to take out the pen, but because he was in a hurry, he could not untie the buttons and placed the gun on the table. As he took the pen from his pocket, Davis cleverly stretched out a foot and knocked a long gown from the end of the bed to the floor. Then, while the defendant was looking down, he quickly grabbed the gun from the table and hid it under the blanket. The defendant looked back and saw that the gun was gone, and he shouted loudly, saying that Davis had hidden his gun. Davis pretended that the servant had taken it. The two argued for a long time. Davis then quietly put the gun in his sleeve, got out of bed, and went downstairs before the defendant. The defendant followed, punching and kicking Davis no less than five or six times. When they reached the bottom of the stairs, Davis pretended to ask the servants, "Who took this gun?" After a long time, as the gun could not be found, the defendant cursed and left. After that, Davis reported to the police and had the defendant arrested. Inside the defendant's gun were five bullets, one of which was already in the chamber, and the safety was not on. Davis secretly put the safety on and then handed it over to the police.</p>

<h3 id="e180">The Fresh Pork Industry Responds to the Social Bureau with Proposed Measures to Crack Down on Inferior Coins <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The Use of Auxiliary Currency Should Be Limited by Law</p>
<p>The Fresh Pork Industry Association of this city, due to the prevalence of inferior coins in the market, in meat transactions, often calculates silver coins into silver dollars, but when converting them, a heavy discount is required, resulting in significant losses in a single transaction. They have submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department, the Social Bureau, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward it to the government for a crackdown. Subsequently, Chairman Zhang Jitang of the association was summoned by the Social Bureau and consulted on effective measures to crack down. He then continued to present measures, stating in the original report: "Submitting this report for continued submission of measures to crack down on inferior coins, hoping for your review. The association previously received a report from member Chunyuan Xing, stating that inferior coins are rampant in the market, resulting in significant losses in a single transaction for merchants. They have submitted a request to your bureau, requesting strict orders to crack down, and requesting the government to uniformly mint, recover, and recoin, and at the same time, send a letter to the customs to strictly investigate smuggling and prevent it from spreading. However, the proposal for unified minting involves cumbersome procedures and is likely to be slow to provide relief, and the ban on imports has been requested by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce in a telegram to the Ministry of Finance. This ban has been in effect to this day and has not changed. This means that even with meticulous measures, omissions are inevitable, and the effectiveness is not certain. The association has been thinking about this repeatedly and believes that the only way is to set a limit on the amount of auxiliary currency that can be used. The types of currency are divided into main currency and auxiliary currency. The main currency is also called the standard currency. In transactions, no matter how large the amount, the receiver cannot refuse it, hence the name 'unlimited legal tender.' Auxiliary currency is used to assist in the circulation of the main currency, in order to facilitate small payments. It was originally intended to alleviate the scarcity of the main currency and cannot be considered an essential means of payment, so its use can be limited by law. Beyond this limit, the receiver can refuse it, and the creditor must refuse it, hence the name 'limited legal tender.' In countries around the world, such as England, the United States, Germany, and Japan, the amount of auxiliary currency that can be used is regulated by law, with a certain limit. For example, the use of British silver coins cannot exceed two gold pounds, in the United States it cannot exceed ten dollars, the use of German silver coins is limited to within twenty marks, and the limit for the use of Japanese silver coins is ten yen. Because the composition of auxiliary currency is low and the nominal price is greater than the actual price, if it is allowed to be used without limit, people will compete to use auxiliary currency to exchange for goods, and prices may fall as a result. Those who receive large amounts of payment not only face various inconveniences in calculation and transportation but also suffer unexpected losses, such as the heavy discount in this industry. All of this adds up over the year, and the amount is not small. Therefore, a legal limit is set on the amount of auxiliary currency that can be used in order to avoid disturbing the market. The prevalence of inferior coins in Shanghai is due to the uneven market price of silver coins and the profits that traffickers can make, but the lack of restrictions on acceptance is also a major reason. Because there is no limit on the amount of auxiliary currency that can be used, the sales of inferior coins are wider, and the profits are greater. The greater the profits, the more traffickers there are, and this is a reciprocal relationship, resulting in the proliferation of inferior coins in the market. If the amount of auxiliary currency that can be used can be limited by law, setting an appropriate limit as a standard, so that the receiver can refuse payments that exceed this limit, then there will not be many silver coins paid, and there will be no way for inferior coins to mix in. Traffickers will also give up on inferior coins because there is no profit to be made, and the number of inferior coins will decrease day by day without being explicitly banned. Therefore, limiting the amount of auxiliary currency that can be used is an effective way to crack down on inferior coins. Whether this is appropriate is respectfully submitted to your bureau for review, as it is for the public good."</p>

<h3 id="e184">Dock Thugs Forcibly Collect Insurance Fees <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Claims to be Named Li Yichang</p>
<p>Flees When the Police Arrive</p>
<p>The thugs on the docks along the South City Bund not only extort money from travelers on various pretexts but also demand insurance fees of two or three yuan per month from various civilian ships and sailing vessels operating on the Bund, under the name of insurance. If any of the boat owners are reluctant to pay, the thugs will find excuses to cause trouble, even gathering a crowd to beat them or sending assassins in secret, so that all boat owners operating on the Bund regard the thugs as tigers and wolves. Even if they are extorted, they dare not resist in the slightest. Therefore, the thugs are becoming increasingly reckless. Yesterday afternoon at around 1 p.m., a boat owner named Zhou Afu happened to arrive in Shanghai from Chuansha with passengers and cargo. After arriving at the port, he docked at the Shengyi Wharf on the South City Bund. Suddenly, one of the above-mentioned dock thugs, claiming to be named Li Yichang, came to collect the insurance fee of one yuan and five jiao for this month. Zhou replied that he had no money to pay. Li, upon hearing this, became very angry and immediately grabbed Zhou, punching him. Zhou, unwilling to accept this, handed him over to Liu Fang, the guard of the 16th Gang in that area, and brought him to the 1st Precinct, 1st Station, where Chief Yi conducted a preliminary hearing. Considering Li's misconduct and assuming his ignorance, he was leniently detained for ten days as a warning. Unexpectedly, after Zhou left the station and was about to return to his boat, he saw Li's father, Li Changyong, and his younger brother, Xiao Ningbo, and a dozen others pre-ambushed on the roadside. Upon seeing Zhou, they rushed forward and took out axes and other weapons, intending to harm him and vent Li's anger. Zhou was shocked by the sight and quickly turned around and fled, narrowly escaping. He immediately reported the situation to Chief Yi of the station, who immediately sent patrols to arrest them. However, the thugs had already fled without a trace. He then ordered a formal document to be prepared and sent to the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau for a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Interrogation of Kidnappers from Xiaoshan <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Kidnapper Shen Yun, from Shaoxing, colluded with accomplices in the first month of this year's lunar calendar and went to Tangshan Bay in his hometown of Xiaoshan County to kidnap Chen Zhurong, the 14-year-old only son of the wealthy Chen Tianyou. They brought him to Shanghai and hid him in the home of Chen Shiying, a fellow villager, at 3 Ping'an Fang, Xuehuali Road, in the French Concession. They sent a letter to the victim, demanding a large sum of money for his release. On March 10th, they opened a room at the Huhai Hotel in Baoyu Lane, and ordered their accomplices to negotiate the ransom with the victim's representative at the entrance of Baoyu Lane on Caishi Street. This was discovered by Inspector Jin Jiulin of the French Police, who rushed there with uniformed detectives and arrested Shen and his accomplices Zhang Baichuan, Wang Achang, Lu Ruigao, Zhou Ruifu, Liu Xichen, Chen Shiying, his wife Chen Shengshi, and suspects Gao Bin, Wang Chenshi, Wu Wangshi, and Fu Lanying, totaling twelve men and women. They rescued the hostage and sent them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Chen Zhurong, the hostage, was sent by his family to Shanghai to be reunited with them. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. This case has been investigated and concluded by the police. Yesterday, Judge Li Changnian visited Criminal Court One and ordered the defendants to be brought in for further trial (Gao Bin, the seventh defendant, was not brought in because he was being treated in a hospital for illness). First, Fei Xizhen, the police lawyer, stated the circumstances of the police solving and investigating the case, saying that it was found that the first defendant, Shen Yun, had acted on the instructions of the fugitive leader Shen Chuangou, colluding with the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth defendants to go to Tangshan Bay in Xiaoshan County, Zhejiang Province on February 11th. The next evening, upon arriving at their destination, they broke into the home of the victim, Chen Tianyou, and kidnapped Chen's son to Shanghai, hiding him in the residence of the eighth defendant, Chen Shiying. Afterwards, he received instructions from Shen Chuangou to negotiate with the victim's representative at Room 5 of the Dongchang Hotel on Avenue Joffre on March 4th and received 100 yuan. On March 9th, he went with the third defendant, Wang Achang, to open Room 33 at the Changxing Hotel on Caishi Street, and negotiated with the victim's representative, receiving 200 yuan. After the incident, the defendants were arrested one after another. Now the police are prosecuting the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and eighth defendants according to Article 1, Clause 1 of the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. The remaining defendants are also suspected, and a legal trial is requested. In court, after verifying the words, he ordered the defendants to be interrogated separately. The seven defendants, including Shen, confessed to colluding in kidnapping, concealing, and extorting ransom. The remaining defendants either claimed to have been arrested while visiting friends at the hotel or were arrested with the defendants in the case due to cohabitation. By the time the interrogation was completed, it was past noon. The court ordered a change of date to May 2nd and designated a defender to come to court for further interrogation. The defendants were still sent back for separate detention.</p>

<p>Sheng Bao states that Jin Shanyuan used to run the Tongyuan Pawnshop on Yutong Road, Zhabei. Due to business losses in 1920, it was transferred to Cheng Yu Ji and renamed Tongyuan Yu Ji, which was reported to the Social Bureau. However, the Tongyuan Yu Ji pawnshop declared its closure due to the impact of the Shanghai War and deposited all its pawned goods in the Baoyu Pawnshop at the intersection of Niuzhuang Road and Yunnan Road in the Public Concession to be redeemed. Unexpectedly, someone recently opened the Tongyuan Xinji Pawnshop at the entrance of Yucheng Li, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei, falsely using Jin Shanyuan's name to report to the Social Bureau the relocation of the address and the change of manager, seeking to avoid registration and operate without authorization. The Social Bureau discovered the falsehood and confirmed that it was true. Because it violated the city's pawnshop business regulations, it has ordered the pawnshop to immediately cease operations, only allow redemption, and imposed a fine in accordance with the regulations.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Wen Ying's Mother Sues Diao Ao Ke and Ling Qing Case <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Involves Feng Mengyun to a Great Extent</p>
<p>Wen Ying's Mother Was Also Countersued in Court</p>
<p>The case of Jianghu fortune teller Diao Ao Ke (also known as Cheng Meixian) and his divorced wife, Cheng Lingqing, along with Feng Mengyun, editor of Da Jing Bao, being sued by Huang Wushi, the mother of the murdered female fortune teller Wen Ying, for offenses such as disruption of the family, was previously tried by the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan continued the interrogation. The defendant Ling Qing also surrendered herself and waited to be questioned along with the other two defendants. Judge Wu instructed the plaintiff to state in detail the circumstances of Cheng Lingqing in this case, in addition to what she had already stated in the previous hearing regarding the two defendants Cheng Meixian and Feng Mengyun, which did not need to be repeated. Huang Wushi said that she was accusing Ling Qing of inducing her daughter to engage in prostitution. Her daughter was taken to the Xinhuizhong Hotel and other places by Ling Qing to have her fortune told or to engage in prostitution countless times since she was fourteen years old. Last June, after her daughter told her and after hearing people talk about it after her daughter's death, she went to Xinhuizhong to inquire, and the tea server said that it was indeed true. When questioned, the defendant Ling Qing stated that Wen Ying learned fortune telling at the age of fifteen. At that time, she and Diao Ao Ke were not yet divorced. Diao's fortune telling studio was located in Xinhuizhong, so she often went there with Wen Ying. Later, she felt that the actions of Diao Ao Ke and Wen Ying were irregular. On one hand, she divorced Diao, and on the other hand, she ordered Wen Ying to drop out of school. In total, she was only in her place for a year and a half and did not induce her to engage in prostitution. Huang Wushi, upon hearing her testimony, responded with abusive words. The court then asked the woman about the situation after her daughter was brought to Shanghai from Hangzhou by Cheng et al. However, the woman's answers were not very coherent. She generally said that at first, every time she came to Shanghai to see her daughter, she was accompanied by either Ling Qing or Diao Ao Ke, and the mother and daughter could not talk. She asked Cheng why her daughter was wearing makeup since she was learning photography, and Cheng said that she had to dress like that to take photos with foreigners. Later, her daughter sent a message through someone saying that Diao Ao Ke was very abusive and asked her to find a way to bring her back. When she asked Diao for her daughter, he demanded a certain amount of money for food and lodging. She then asked a battalion commander in Hangzhou to send a letter to Diao Ao Ke, who replied with a photo of Feng Mengyun and her daughter side by side, and said that he would make Feng her son-in-law. The affair between Feng and her daughter happened when she was fifteen years old. Feng Mengyun denied this absolutely and orally stated that he was filing a countersuit against Huang Wushi for defamation, requesting that the woman be placed on bail. Cheng Lingqing also stated that she was filing a countersuit against Huang Wushi. The court then ordered the woman to stand in the defendant's position and asked if she had any defense against the countersuit. Huang Wushi said, "Who is destroying whose reputation? Please investigate clearly." Then, after the lawyers on both sides debated each other, the court stated that the plaintiff still had an ancillary private suit seeking 36,000 yuan in damages from Cheng Meixian and Cheng Lingqing, and ordered the lawyers on both sides to debate this point before announcing that the case would be sentenced on the morning of April 29th. As for Feng Mengyun's request that Huang Wushi be placed on bail, the court stated that it was not necessary.</p>

<p>Bi Jiugao, a Ningbo native residing at a certain address on Dengtuo Road, aged twenty-six, married Wang from the same village last July. After their marriage, their relationship was generally harmonious. However, in January of this year, due to Wang's absence from home for four nights, a quarrel ensued. Wang then returned to her mother's home at 54 Longqing Lane, Dongxi Huade Road. On the fourteenth of that month, Bi went to persuade his wife to return home, but she refused. He then used a razor to wound her neck. After mediation by relatives and friends, Wang was sent back to her husband's house, with promises of reconciliation. However, within a week, another disagreement arose, and Wang left without notice, returning to her mother's house, determined not to return. From then on, the house was empty, and Bi was unable to bring his wife back. Later, through an introduction, he worked as a bathhouse attendant at a hot spring pool on Aiduya Road to earn a living. However, he constantly thought about his wife's infidelity, suspecting she had another lover, which caused him increasing distress. On the evening of the nineteenth of this month, at 11:30 PM, he and two friends secretly went to his mother-in-law's house with a sharp axe to provoke a quarrel with Wang. After a brief argument, he pulled out the axe and砍wounded his wife in the forehead and feet, causing her to fall to the ground. Seeing that their objective was achieved, Bi and his friends fled. Wang's sister, Wang A'mei, reported the incident to the Huishan Police Station, which sent detectives to investigate. Wang was sent to Shanghai Sanitarium and Hospital for treatment. The detectives apprehended Bi Jiugao a few days ago, and yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Xiao Xie-fen presided over the hearing. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that the defendant had confessed at the police station to wounding Wang's feet in four places with the axe. Currently, Wang is in the hospital, and according to doctors, she will need a week to fully recover. It was found that Wang suffered one wound to the forehead and four to the feet. The police are prosecuting him for severe injury under Article 294 of the Criminal Code and requested an adjournment. Witness Wang A'mei testified that she is the defendant's sister-in-law. In January, her sister went to her in-laws' house for the New Year's festivities and stayed for several nights. Unexpectedly, the defendant suspected her sister of impropriety and used a razor to wound her neck, leading to a breakdown in their relationship. Fearing his violence, she returned to her mother's house and worked in a cigarette factory to earn a living. On the evening of the nineteenth of this month, the defendant suddenly came to their house with two others to provoke a quarrel. He stopped her mother, and his friend Fu Sheng used an axe to wound her sister in the forehead and feet before fleeing.

<h3 id="e201">The Only Way to Remedy the Cotton Mill Industry <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>The crisis in the cotton mill industry did not begin today, nor did the industry's appeals for help. After maintaining a struggle and being forced to reduce labor, the government and society began to pay attention. China is an agricultural country, but cotton production is not abundant. Most Chinese people's clothing is made of cotton textiles. However, domestic cotton cloth has no foothold because it is squeezed by imported goods and domestic and foreign merchant cotton mills. This did not happen overnight. (A) Remote causes: (1) Most Chinese cotton mills are undercapitalized and heavily indebted. (2) Bank interest rates are too high. (3) Factories lack public reserves. (4) Technology is not refined. (5) There is a lack of direct buying and selling of cotton yarn and cloth. (6) Transportation is inconvenient. (B) Recent causes: (1) The Manchurian Incident and the Japanese occupation of Northeast China promoted rural bankruptcy, making farmers' purchasing power weaker. (2) There are many heavy taxes on cotton yarn and cloth. (3) Cotton yarn transportation costs are too high. (4) It has become more difficult to manage workers in recent years. (5) Inland cotton mills are often regarded as fat meat. (6) Gold prices are too high, and imported goods are very expensive. (7) There are too many workers (Japanese factories in China have recently hired many Japanese workers. Each 10,000 spindles only uses 180 to 240 workers, while domestic Chinese factories use 750 workers per 10,000 spindles). (8) There is a worldwide recession, and Japanese cotton goods are being dumped. Most domestic cotton mills suffer from these two causes. The situation is so urgent that if the government only pays lip service to research, investigation, and encouragement, it will be irrelevant. If it really wants to help domestic industries, there is no other way than the following measures. (A) Actively promote and improve cotton planting with a nationally planned and systematic approach. China is short about 3 million piculs of cotton each year, worth more than 130 million silver dollars. Because of the cotton shortage, it has no choice but to buy foreign cotton. Because gold is expensive and silver is cheap, foreign cotton is expensive, and Chinese cotton is also expensive. Cotton yarn depreciates because of slow sales. Expensive cotton and cheap yarn is the biggest crisis in the cotton mill industry. This crisis cannot be fundamentally reversed without actively promoting cotton planting to achieve self-sufficiency. (B) Passively: (1) Eliminate all kinds of heavy taxes on cotton yarn. (2) Revise the unified tax grade and return a few points of the unified tax to Chinese factories as a bonus. (3) Appropriately reduce cotton yarn transportation costs. (4) Reduce loan interest rates. (5) Implement machine consolidation, worker training, cost reduction, and elimination of ineffective employees. If the above items can be implemented one by one, then even in the worst global state, China's cotton mill industry may be able to maintain itself, otherwise it will not only reduce labor by 20% or 30%. In recent years, gold has been expensive and silver has been cheap, and domestic cash has been flowing out. Since the United States abandoned the gold standard, the price of silver has gradually increased, and silver has gradually flowed out. I am afraid that if we do not take preventive measures in the short term, domestic cash will also flow out completely. Then paper money will be rampant, and prices will inevitably soar. Germany's economic situation after the European war will soon be seen in our country. Looking around the country's industry and commerce, everything is in danger. At this time, the government's major policies cannot be changed, otherwise, those who directly suffer are those in industry and commerce, and those who indirectly suffer are the entire Chinese people. The government should actively and vigorously promote the principle of creating production. No matter what kind of industry, as long as it is directly or indirectly beneficial to the whole people, we should do our best to protect it. If there are any destructive or harmful industries that harm the people, we should try our best to eliminate them. Otherwise, even if there is an Adam Smith or someone like him in China today, there will be no way to do well later. I hope that the government officials will start planning quickly.</p>

<p>The Delusional Dream of a Yao King’s Birth</p>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Uncivilized people still cling to the delusional dream of an emperor's birth, hoping that a foundation built on divine mandate will arise from a few kitchen knives and old-fashioned muskets. They loudly chant the fervent slogan of "Uplift the Yao and Destroy the Han," believing that this slogan alone can terrify the souls of the Han people and shatter the courage of the Han race. However, when they come into contact with a regular army, they are like leaves encountering the autumn wind, and amidst cries of suffering, countless lives are lost. Regarding the Yao rebellions in Hanyang, Yining, Xing'an, Quanxian, and other places in Guizhou Province, I know that the wars of the eleventh century, regardless of right or wrong, are fought with material resources. If one's material resources are inferior but one still insists on trying to win, one may achieve occasional victories, but ultimately, failure is inevitable. The Yao people of Guizhou Province serve as a warning.</p>
<p>The reason for the Yao rebellions in Guizhou Province stems from incitement by the Han people. The Yao people, content to live beyond the pale of civilization, have always lived in peace with the Han. Why would they rebel for no reason? It is only because in the past thirty years, as the world has become more civilized, people's hearts have become more cunning. When they encounter the uncarved Yao people, they treat them like smooth operators dealing with country bumpkins, seeking profit through insult and oppression. As a result, the Yao people have forged a deep hatred with the Han people, declaring the birth of a Yao king to rally support. Moreover, Liu Bingwen, a Han man from Xing'an County, has colluded with degenerate Han people, joining the Yao army for opportunistic gains, and their momentum has become quite strong. When the Yao people saw the Han people echoing them, their ambitions grew even stronger, and they immediately raised their flags and launched a rebellion on a large scale, attacking various villages and even capturing county towns in order to realize their plan of "Uplifting the Yao and Destroying the Han." Later, the 19th Division moved its troops to suppress the Yao rebellion, dispatching the 56th and 57th Regiments to take charge of the pacification. It is pitiful to see the Yao people, relying on kitchen knives and shouldering old-fashioned muskets, fall to the ground dead in rows from the bullets! The delusional dream of a Yao king's birth has been shattered by the fierce gunfire, and they have no choice but to succumb to the profound and painful loss!</p>
<p>Cutting wood into weapons and raising poles as flags may have allowed Chen She and Wu Guang to run amok in the uncivilized era of Qin Shi Huang. However, if Qin Shi Huang had possessed a navy, air force, and army, then for every two rebels who cut wood and raised poles, one pair would die. Is there any hope of success? Now, the international Qin Shi Huang, who possesses the navy, air force, and army, is flexing his muscles, knowing that the old methods of cutting wood and raising poles cannot defeat him, and so he prides himself on his power.</p>

<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>Miss Xi Shi was a famous beauty in Chinese history. It is said that Miss Xi Shi's beauty lay in her having a heart condition, which caused her eyebrows to furrow. At that time, there happened to be a Miss Dong Shi, who did not have a heart condition but, in a flight of fancy, also held her heart with both hands and furrowed her brows, trying to compete with Miss Xi Shi to see who was prettier. However, Miss Xi Shi's holding her heart was like our East Asian weaklings, naturally ill, while Miss Dong Shi's holding her heart was artificial, making people sick to their stomachs. So there is a classic story called "Dong Shi Imitates Xi Shi," which mocks people for "drawing a tiger but ending up with a dog."</p>
<p>With the eastward spread of Western culture, Western misses and missies have begun to expand into China. Western misses and missies all wear high heels on their six-inch bound feet, and when they walk, their breasts shake in front and their buttocks sway in the back, which is indeed beautiful. Eastern misses and missies, seeing this, are envious and also put on high heels on their newly liberated feet, hobbling and twisting. As a result, they fall over, sprain their ankles, and perform countless other tricks. Western misses and missies are born with curly hair and long eyelashes. Eastern misses and missies feel that this is particularly charming, so they also perm their black hair and blacken their eyes, trying to compete to see who is prettier. Unfortunately, without bleaching their yellow skin and dyeing their black eyes and hair, no matter how closely they imitate, they cannot hide their true Dong Shi face.</p>
<p>Western misses and missies all talk about "socializing publicly," "free love," "female independence," and "gender equality." However, Eastern misses and missies, when imitating this, have achieved the cause of "different paths leading to the same goal," but the result of "different women" is that everything has become "romantic" and "indulgent," like wild horses without reins.</p>
<p>Xi Shi holding her heart and Dong Shi imitating her has become a joke for the ages. Are Eastern misses and missies imitating Western misses and missies in everything in a way that is just right? Please tell me if the imitators have succeeded.</p>
<h3 id="e203">East and West of Fourth Avenue <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Zhongqin</p>
<p>Every time I walk along this bustling Fourth Avenue, I always say to myself, "Friend, this is the road that leads you to enlightenment, that satisfies your desire for knowledge, and at the same time, it can also tempt you, squandering your youth and leading you to depravity! On the same road, there are two different paths, and you should pay attention to what lies ahead! Over there, infinite treasures await you, but over there, there are also animals more venomous than snakes and fiercer than beasts attracting you!" Especially at night, when I walk along Fourth Avenue, I repeat these words to myself, walking from east to west. Starting from Henan Road, there are many precious keys hanging there, waiting for their masters to take them, keys to open the doors of knowledge. The Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, Datong, Kaiming, Modern Publishing House, etc., are where these precious keys reside. You can go and take them. Young people should often seek the keys they need.</p>
<p>Further west, on the cement sidewalks in front of the World Bookstore, or on the sidewalks in front of the Qingguang Bookstore, when young pedestrians pass by, especially young people who look like students, there stands someone wearing a tattered long gown, holding a cigarette butt in his hand, and he hums beside the young people, "Want to buy *spring* [pornography]?" This is the first step in leading young people down the path of depravity.</p>
<p>Further west, all the way to Xizang Road, this section in the middle is the main camp for leading young people astray. Once the silver lights come on, a group of creatures adorned with small electric lights shuttle back and forth, beginning their deadly work. Young people are occasionally bewildered, drawn to the allure of beauty and pleasure, and the only result is to lose their footing and fall into depravity. However, many modern university students, and even middle school students, are unknowingly indulging in it, not realizing their peril until it's too late.</p>
<p>In short, Fourth Avenue is the central point of cultural undertakings, and also the main factory for manufacturing sin. On the same road, one east and one west, they show absolute opposites.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Fuzhou Under the Gaze of Hawks and Owls <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Hongqing</p>
<p>Because the enemy's fierce offensive has brazenly broken into the pass, with rumors spreading that its aim is not only Tianjin and Hebei, but also Shandong and Fujian, I can't help but think of Fuzhou. Fuzhou, separated from Taiwan by only a narrow stretch of water, has long been under the gaze of hawks and owls since Taiwan was ceded. Therefore, the Japanese expatriates in Fuzhou all carry a certain air of aggression, even though they are all doing business. The largest concentration of Japanese expatriates is in Nantai Fan Chuanpu, and the largest business is Osaka Shosen Kaisha, which domestic shipping companies cannot match. For example, when a domestic ship docks at Luoxing Pagoda in Mawei, the ships traveling to Fuzhou cannot directly reach the inland river. Small boats are used to transport passengers and goods to Nantai, charging an additional five jiao per person. Japanese ships do not charge extra, so naturally passengers prefer to travel on Japanese ships. Japanese expatriates also run a newspaper called "Min Bao," which serves as a mouthpiece for public opinion. Initially, it was written in Chinese, but later it was changed to a Chinese-Japanese bilingual format. This newspaper has a strong influence in Fuzhou, speaking frankly and without restraint, which naturally makes it popular among readers, surpassing the newspapers run by the Chinese themselves. In addition, there are also the Bo'ai Hospital and the Lushanxuan Photo Studio, both of which are very famous. There are also many prostitutes.</p>
<p>It is easy to see that the Japanese expatriates in Fuzhou have an air of aggression, unlike the expatriates from other countries who are mainly engaged in business. They have created a cherry blossom atmosphere in their residential area, and walking through it makes one feel as if they are no longer in Fuzhou, which is even more frightening! In particular, there are also many Taiwanese people who have forgotten their homeland and act as accomplices for the enemy, often engaging in acts of humiliation against the Chinese people. During Fang Shengtāo's administration, he handled matters properly, hoping that the province would be safe, but in the end, things still happened. Now that the enemy's fierce offensive has already broken into the pass, and Shandong and Fujian are within their ambitious grasp, when the time comes, the Japanese expatriates in the Nantai Fan Chuanpu area will undoubtedly be the vanguard. It all depends on how the current authorities prepare.</p>

<p>Chapter 5: Brewing Tea to Pass the Long Night, Holding Guns Thinking of the Year's End, Raising High the Banner of Resistance Against Tyranny, Shouting Loudly</p>
<p>Gui Zhi smiled, "I'm not leaving, I'm pouring tea." Zhao Weng said with a smile, "That's good, let's not be strangers, we should be like family." As he spoke, he stroked his beard and nodded. Gui Zhi poured three cups of hot tea, and everyone shared them. Zhao Weng put down his cup, listened intently for a while, and said absentmindedly, "Am I drunk?" Yang Old Woman. Jiang Shi said with a smile, "You're not drunk." Zhao Weng hesitated and said, "Am I not drunk? If you say I'm not drunk, then this is really something new. How come tonight, on New Year's Eve, I can't hear a single firecracker?" Gui Zhi said, "Have you forgotten? There's martial law this year, and firecrackers are not allowed on New Year's Eve." Zhao Weng then stroked his beard, shook his head, and said, "I've lived in Beijing for fifty years, and this is the first time that firecrackers are not allowed on New Year's Eve." Gui Zhi pouted and said, "It's all because of those damn Japanese, they're causing trouble, so the government won't allow us to set off firecrackers." Zhao Weng shook his head and said, "This isn't the fault of the Japanese, it's because you Chinese people don't stand up for yourselves. I see on the map that Japan is ten times smaller than China. According to Ziqiang [son], Japan's population is only one-fifth of ours. Why are we letting them bully us? My Ziqiang is stupid. When he comes back, he always talks to me about the current situation, saying that he wants to be a commander and this and that. I tell him that a company commander should just fulfill his responsibilities as a company commander, and not talk about the things a commander does. Old woman, I'm different from other old men. I don't want my son to be a division or brigade commander, and I don't want to make millions or tens of thousands of silver dollars. Think about it, I'm so old, I'm almost in the grave, what use do I have for wealth and glory? But I just have this one son, and my son is a soldier. In a country on the verge of collapse like this, the fate of a soldier is really uncertain. I just have one selfish wish, to hold a grandson soon. If he can carry on the Zhao family line, I can die in peace." As he spoke, he poured himself another cup of tea and sat down to drink it. Jiang Shi said with a smile, "Isn't that an easy thing to do? You should find a young lady for the company commander as soon as possible." Zhao Weng took a sip of tea and sighed. "You don't know, my son has two friends with new ideas, and he reads newspapers and magazines himself. He says that the saying 'There are three unfilial acts, the greatest of which is to have no descendants' is not valid. As long as he is filial to his father, that's enough. It doesn't matter if he has a son or not." (May Fourth Movement)</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Customer Is Always Right <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>I have a friend who is most afraid of going to stores to buy things in his life, and he always entrusts others to do it if he can avoid going himself. Once I asked him why he was afraid of going to stores to buy things, was it because he was afraid of trouble? Was it because he wanted to save effort? But he sighed and said, "Neither, neither! I don't want to see the (unpleasant faces) and indifferent attitudes of these shop assistants, so I'm afraid of going to stores to buy things." Indeed, the faces and attitudes of many shop assistants can easily drive away customers and offend them, no wonder my friend looks at them with dread and dares not ask them anything, dismissing them entirely. No wonder people who come back from Europe, America, and Japan often praise the shop assistants in Europe, America, and Japan, how polite, humble, courteous, and patient they are to customers, and how they know how to do business. Recently, I saw a very valuable article in an American magazine, which is worth reading for Chinese businessmen. Now I will translate the gist of it as follows:</p>
<p>The dining cars of a certain railway in the northern United States are all contracted by a certain boss, and the business is very prosperous, and every customer is satisfied. According to general passengers, their satisfaction is not in the exquisiteness and deliciousness of the dishes, but in the thoughtfulness of the waiters' service.</p>
<p>In the past, a certain boss only opened a small tavern at the station. In this tavern, in addition to all the necessary equipment and decorations, there was also a very eye-catching slogan pasted on it, which read: "The customer is always right."</p>
<p>The boss on the one hand tried to improve the dishes, and on the other hand, he devoted all his efforts to training the waiters. The training method was very ingenious. Every day, he took one or two hours of free time to teach the waiters to be customers, and the old man acted as the waiter. How to greet, how to serve dishes, how to talk, how to collect money, how to see off guests, he personally taught them one by one.</p>
<p>The waiters here, in addition to keeping the sentence on the slogan in mind at all times, had to implement it anytime and anywhere. If a customer thought that a certain dish was not well done (in fact, it was very good, but he said it was not well done), he must change it. If the waiter did not allow it, then the boss, knowing it, would immediately (fire) the disobedient waiter without any room for negotiation, because the contract signed when entering the store already had a penalty clause of (immediate dismissal for offending customers).</p>
<p>Because a certain boss always adhered to the slogan "The customer is always right", he can always get the effect of "business is always good". If the friend I mentioned above saw this article, he would definitely sigh again and say: "Some stores in our country inconspicuously paste the slogan "The customer is always wrong", so they will always get the retribution of "business is always bad".</p>
<h3 id="e207">Advertising in Soviet Russia <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Fo</p>
<p>In imperialist countries, commercial advertising is included in university courses, how sacred and solemn, businessmen intrigue and fight, and there are hundreds of techniques, which are promoted and expanded to what extent. But in Soviet Russia, where communism has been transformed from an ideal to a reality, and in our country, which has restored diplomatic relations after moving from an ideal to a reality, advertising has become a thing of the past, simply unnecessary. Because as long as the policy of public ownership of products exists, advertising will become a waste.</p>
<p>The most widely circulated newspaper in Soviet Russia now is called Pārvda (meaning Trust), with a daily circulation of two million copies, and of course it is a government organ. The so-called advertisements are only like the classified advertisements in Shen Bao, such as house rentals, job recruitment, furniture sales, and statements of loss. In addition, there are government announcements to the public on how to avoid tuberculosis, as well as warnings about drinking, how it makes people poor. There is nothing of a commercial advertising nature to speak of.</p>
<p>Then again, Soviet Russia is not unaware of the true meaning of commercial advertising. For all of their export industries, grains, seafood, etc., they pay great attention to the cleanliness and tidiness of packaging, the beauty of decoration and printing, and the novelty and uniqueness of the explanatory phrases, all of which are very much in line with the principles of advertising and possess the conditions of advertising. This spirit of selflessness is truly a great expression of national character.</p>

<p>▲ When Li's coffin passed Xisi Pailou, students propagated communism</p>
<p>▲ Jiang Menglin said the principal could not interfere with student activities</p>
<p>(Beiping Special Dispatch) The 23rd was the date for the funeral and burial of the coffin of former Peking University Professor Li Dazhao. The coffin departed from the Miaoguangge Zhejiang Temple in Xiaxiejie at 9:00 a.m. and went directly to the Wanan Cemetery in Xiangshan for burial. When passing Xisi Pailou, hundreds of students blocked the road to pay their respects and distributed leaflets along the way, chanting slogans. Because there were many people and the police were unable to maintain order, Yang Enhua, the captain of the Fourth Reconnaissance Squad of the nearby police, and Wang Dehua, the captain of the Fourth Team, led their troops to maintain order. Li's coffin then passed safely. Twenty students were arrested. The situation from various parties is recorded as follows:</p>

<h3 id="e214">Jiang Mengling's Talk <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Li Dazhao was an old professor at Peking University. Out of friendship and affection, the school's president, Jiang Menglin, allowed fundraising to handle Li's funeral and burial. Unexpectedly, when the funeral took place, the students took actions outside the boundaries of the school. The reporter interviewed Jiang to inquire about the truth. He replied as follows: When Mr. Li Dazhao's coffin passed Xisi Pailou, suddenly more than a hundred students came and blocked the road to offer sacrifices, give speeches, and distribute leaflets. The military police stepped forward to stop them, so twenty students were arrested. I live in Maojiawan, which is close to Xisi Pailou. The car traveled to Xisi Beidajie, and I learned about this matter. So, I inquired with the military police about what happened, but I didn't get any results. I have now sent someone to inquire. The school authorities cannot interfere with students' actions outside the school. In recent years, the thinking of young students has leaned to the left, which is really dangerous. Spreading doctrine on the street is too stupid. Knowing that the military police are strict, why bother to throw yourself into the net? When Mr. Li's coffin passed Xizhimen, only Mrs. Li and her children and relatives were sending the coffin, and there were no students. By the time it was buried at the Wanan Cemetery in Xiangshan, it was already sunset. Mr. Li was lonely after his death, and his children were still young and studying in middle school, unable to support themselves. Because Mr. Li was an old professor at Peking University, his owed salary has already been paid in full, and a pension of 40 yuan per month will be issued for 20 months. The family's living expenses now depend on this. As for the cost of handling the funeral, it was raised by friends, totaling more than 600 yuan, and more than 300 yuan was used for the funeral. Because Li's coffin was parked in Miaoguangge, the parking fee had not been paid for many years. According to the person serving the spirit, more than 100 yuan in parking fees are owed, and they are currently discussing with the Zhejiang Tongxiang Association.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Preliminary Notes <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>Due to the large number of participants in the 100-meter, 200-meter and 400-meter races, the preliminary rounds were held at the China Athletic Field yesterday afternoon starting at 4:30 PM. After a long period of rain, the weather cleared up and the sun shone brightly, and the spectators were very enthusiastic. A total of 24 preliminary rounds were held for the men's Group B 100-meter race, 14 preliminary rounds for the Group A and B 200-meter race, and four groups of preliminary rounds for the 400-meter race. The races continued until dusk, and all the lights were on before they were completed.</p>
<p>▲3,000 Spectators: After ten days of continuous spring rain, the skies finally cleared. It was generally believed that it would affect the competition. However, the heavens unexpectedly favored us, and the clouds dissipated yesterday morning, with the sun rising brightly. The lovely sunlight illuminated the vast battlefield. At around 2:00 PM, more than 3,000 people came to watch the events. Although it was not an important program, it attracted such a large crowd. It is expected that the formal opening today will be a spectacular event with a huge crowd.</p>
<p>▲Venue Arrangement: The China Athletic Field, which had been deserted for a long time, was given a new look yesterday. Temporary barracks for the athletes, made of reed mats, were set up on the east, north, and due north sides of the field. Each barrack had the school emblem hanging in front of the door, in various colors, fluttering in the wind, and creating a majestic atmosphere. The sides of the barracks were interspersed with scout canvas tents, complementing each other and adding to the beauty of the scene. The command platform was located on the west side of the field, built on top of the stands, and was large enough to accommodate hundreds of people to stand on the stage and look around, with a panoramic view of the entire field, which was very advantageous.</p>
<p>▲A Glimpse of the Results: Looking at the results of the three preliminary races yesterday, the best time for the 100-meter race was 12.0 seconds, achieved by Liu Jiaxian of Minli, while the rest were above 12.2 seconds. The best time for the 200-meter race was 25.0 seconds by Dong Yinchu of Guanghua. All the times for the 400-meter race were above 58.0 seconds. The preliminary rounds were only for qualification, and the results were not investigated in depth, or perhaps the athletes had not fully developed their skills.</p>
<p>▲As I Saw It: Among the athletes, Dong Yinchu of Guanghua and Guan Changfa of Nanfang Middle School, although their results were not outstanding, their body shapes were suitable, their postures were graceful, and their sprinting skills were superb, making them talents worth cultivating. It is hoped that they will perform well in the repechage and final rounds.</p>
<p>▲Penalty for False Starts: There were many false starts in yesterday's preliminary rounds. Each time the race started, there were always some runners who started too early, and the race had to be recalled and restarted. As a result, many runners were penalized for false starts. There were two main reasons for this: (1) Insufficient training: the athletes lacked thorough starting training during practice, so they could not start precisely when the gun fired; (2) Intentionally trying to get a head start, hoping to win by taking a chance. Both of these are not good phenomena and should be strongly discouraged.</p>
<h3 id="e231">Tidbits <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>▲Calling Out "Old Master" Three Times: Although yesterday was only a preliminary round, each school attached great importance to it as they were vying for the repechage and the finals. All the cheering squads came to the venue to cheer on their teams. The students of Minli were particularly enthusiastic. After Liu Jiayu of Minli achieved a good record in the third group of the 100-meter Group A race, the students of Minli were overjoyed. When Tang Weijun of Minli clenched his teeth and won first place in the fifth group, the students smashed through the finish line and shouted "Old Master" three times, with voices soaring into the sky.</p>
<p>▲River of No Return and Dog Hole: After the 400-meter race ended, the crowd, because it was getting late, headed towards the northeast edge of the field near the basketball room. There was a ditch of water about seven feet wide, with a board across it to serve as a bridge. The board was narrow and there were many people, so the crowd suffered greatly. As a result, some people who could not pass called it the "River of No Return." After crossing the River of No Return, there was a bamboo fence on the east side of the basketball room, with a small door that only allowed one person to pass through at a time, and one had to lower their head slightly. At this time, it was as crowded as chickens laying eggs. Therefore, it was also jokingly referred to as the "Dog Hole," which can be said to be both amusing and satirical.</p>
<p>(Note) The school names listed under the athletes' names are often difficult to interpret. The following is a summary of the main ones, with annotations as follows: (Zhizhong) refers to Zhonghua Vocational Middle School, (Model) refers to Nanyang Model Middle School, (Shangzhong) refers to Provincial Shanghai Middle School, (Private Shang) refers to Private Shanghai Middle School, (Qingzhong) refers to YMCA Middle School.</p>

<p>▲Medina 1,000 Points ... Li Gongying 992</p>
<p>The second day of the final will be held this afternoon</p>
<p>Chinese and Portuguese masters Li Gongying and Medina met again yesterday in the finals of the Shanghai Amateur Group A event. The two men's skills were outstanding. The battle was announced and the spectators gathered. A total of one thousand points were played in two sessions, rising and falling, and with you ahead of me and me ahead of you, the ability to change was exhausted. As a result of the competition, Medina first reached one thousand points, and Li Gongying had nine hundred and ninety-two points, with only a slight difference. Today is the second day of the final. There is only one session at 5:30 PM, with a total of five hundred points. Who comes out on top depends on the efforts of the two men today.</p>

<p>At the start of exchanging shots, Li showed an initial burst of brilliance. Beginning with the third shot, scoring 20, 75, 5, 55, and 55, he totaled 156 points. At that time, Medina was under pressure and only scored 14 points. After several more shots, Li continued to dominate. Medina had no choice but to switch his gun and fight again, hoping to recover. By the fifteenth shot, the score was 212 to 70 in Li's favor. Medina began to improve, at one point reaching 139 to 227. Then Li scored a massive 30 and 48 consecutively, widening the gap again to 155 points.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Returning Hand-in-Hand <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Medina's luck turned, and his shots and tactics were both excellent, just like Li's ease at the start of the game. He progressed continuously and became unstoppable. Li's golden age had faded. He resorted to a scorched-earth strategy to trap his opponent, but the enemy's momentum was strong and always successful. After 26, 60, and 24, he scored another massive 32 on the 48th shot, surpassing Li with 393 to 368. At this point, Li furiously sped up, scoring 38 in one shot, bringing them neck and neck. Soon, they both reached 499 points. It was Medina's turn, and he reached 500 points first, ending the first half.</p>
<h3 id="e239">An Eight-Point Difference <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>In the second half, Medina played strong moves first, scoring 27 and 22 in two shots, leading by 50 points. Li responded with 28 and 26 in two shots, bringing them back to a level playing field. They first saw a tie at 693, then another at 787. Medina used his amazing technique and scored a massive 83, leading again with 874 to 791. Li was unconcerned, focusing on advancing.

<h3 id="e240">Finance: Gold Market Steady and Continues to Rise at Six Yuan <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Although the news is bad, what can be done when there are so many short coverings?</p>
<p>The gold market is extremely stable, and sentiment is very good. Early in the morning, because of foreign dispatches, London's spot and forward prices both rose by 3.75, the exchange rate for US dollars against British pounds fell by 1.75, US dollars against British pounds fell by 3, the forward silver price fell by 1.3 li and 8 li respectively, the New York silver price shrank by 1.25, and private dispatches shrank by 1.125. The decline was less than expected by the industry. The gross market opened and immediately retreated to 345 yuan. The Yifeng Yongjin bars gradually rose, breaking through 423 yuan. Daxing, Yongbing, and Xing all sold, but still returned to within 40 yuan. Tongyi sold bars on the market, opening at 935.5 yuan. The foreign exchange market gradually hardened. August US dollars were sold from 24.875 yuan to 25.125 yuan and were still difficult to sell, retreating to 29 yuan. Afterwards, the domestic market gradually tightened, and the same industry continued to close positions, so the gold price stabilized. Although there were declines because China had silver exports and US Bank Reuters predicted that it would rise by 3 points, it soon rallied. Major players in the market aggressively covered their short positions, successively breaking through the 30 and 40 yuan marks. Reuters reported that the inflationary plan (reducing gold content, more silver coins, or silver purchases, etc.) had a hope of being passed. Although it rose to above 40 yuan, it still fell back. Finally, banks sold "stomach roads" (likely a type of hedging), and the gold industry relentlessly covered their positions, so the noon closing was 945 yuan, with "cooked red" (premium for immediate delivery) calculated at 40 yuan. During the half-day, Daxing, Yongbing, and Xing tried their best to cover their short positions. Now the half-day market situation is recorded:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 935.5 yuan, slightly lower than the previous close by 3.5 yuan. Goods opened at 6 yuan, and the foreign exchange market was initially flat, but at this point it has seen a slight hardening. The recent offer price for British exchange was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 0.0625, and US exchange was 24.125 yuan. Wanxing was the first to enter bars, reaching 9 yuan, but because August US dollars at 24.875 yuan were difficult to sell, Fuyu, Richang, Hengyu, Fuchang, Daxing, Yong, etc. all sold, leading to a downstream situation. August US dollars at 25 yuan were difficult to sell, and Fuchang, Hengxing, Daxing, Yong competed to sell, resulting in 0.3 yuan. Hua Bi ate August US dollars at 25 yuan, returning up to 2 yuan, but because Meifeng continued to block August at 0.0625, Fuchang, etc. continued to sell, retreating to 29 yuan. Bingxing vigorously bought in, and Yuanxing, Yongtian, and Fengyong also purchased, reaching 33 yuan. The foreign exchange market remained firm. August US dollars at 1.25 were difficult to unload, and Shunli sold out at 30 yuan. Sentiment was stable. Yuanchun was the first to take over, gradually rising, June US dollars at 4.375 were difficult to close out, and Qingfa, Yongheng, Yu Fuyu came up to enter bars, reaching 7 yuan. Also, August US dollars at 25 yuan had no sellers. Yuankang, Xiangfu, Fuchang, and Yuanheng came out and entered again, improving to 43 yuan. Rumors circulated about silver exports and US Bank's bullish trend. Yuankang and Xiang suddenly unloaded, and Zhifeng, Yongheng, Yu Fuyu sold a little, falling to 29 yuan. Daxing, Yonghong, and Li Zelian entered, pulling up 2 yuan. HSBC's listing revealed that British was flat and US was slightly 0.25. Hua Bi came out with July US dollars at 0.5 yuan, and Hefeng also came out with June at 3.125. Yuankang, Xiang, etc. still came to sell bars, and the decline was quite rapid. Hengxing, Hongli, Hengyu, Zhaofeng, and Chang also sold, reaching 34 yuan. Hua Bi came out with July US dollars at 0.625 too. Daxingyong and Yongfeng both entered. Ruixing successively sold bars, and the situation wavered. By the time Bingxing and Fuchang took over again, it reached 9.5 yuan. Hua Bi came out with June US dollars at 3.125, Citibank continued to block the same month at 3.75, and Zhifengyong sold bars, reaching 6 yuan. Although Mitsui had eaten August US dollars at 0.875 (Dalian gang came out), it rose slightly for a time. No matter how much Hengyu, Zhaofengchang, Yuanshengyong came to sell, it fell to 2 yuan. Yuanheng then entered, Fuyu, Hengyu, and Shunli also entered. In addition, August US dollars at 0.875 were required by the bank, and they poured to outside 40 yuan. Yuanshengyong entered to 42.5 yuan. HSBC came out with August US dollars at 0.75, and Yuankangxiang Yifengyong sold again. Foreign telegrams reported that the inflation case seemed to have passed, and retail investors sold out one after another, reaching 36.5 yuan. After that, it hovered for a long time, and the trend was still stable. Panggen ate August US dollars at 0.8125, which Dalian gang came out with, and Shunli then entered the term index, and Hengyu also took it, breaking through to outside 40 yuan. Hongli, Tianfengyong entered to 45 yuan. Sentiment was excellent. Zhaofengchang also purchased, reaching outside 7 yuan. Bingxing vigorously covered their short positions. HSBC's listing preview showed that the change was shortened, with British at a small 0.25, US at a small 0.375, reaching 9 yuan. Although there was a pullback, Yuanaoyong also vigorously purchased on behalf of Bingxing, and it rose again to 49.5 yuan. Hua Bi sold to Zhongnan July US dollars at 3.125, and Qianchangxiang sold bars and fell. Before long, Hua Bi blocked June again at 1.25, and Wanxing sold again, so the closing was 945 yuan. In the afternoon, there was no market on Wednesday. Goods were auctioned at 4 yuan. It was found that the highest price in the half-day was 49.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 29 yuan, a difference of 20.05 yuan. As a result, it rose by another 6 yuan compared with the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price was due to the HSBC bank's listing of US dollars, which was shortened by 0.625 in total, to a gold price of 23.125 yuan for gold alloys of 1021 yuan and zero. According to the closing price, it was about 76 yuan pressed, more than 20 yuan more than the previous close. The registered amount for this month was 972 yuan, May was 966 yuan, June was 945 yuan, and the water supplement was 970 yuan. The cooked red was chaotic. The initial calculation was based on an increase of 423 yuan, but no transaction was seen. Generally, an increase of 40 yuan was used as the standard. Inferior goods in the market (Xuzhou gang) once traded with an increase of 35 yuan. There were also a few transactions, calculated as an increase of 48 yuan, which were taken over by small silver shops (April public orders). Run Changyong released 35 bars, Dafengheng 35 bars, and Yingfengheng 21 bars. The receiver was Tongfenghang 91 bars. Swaps were never officially heard of. The premium (May-June) was roughly 245 yuan. Dealers of spot numbers, Yingfenghang, Dalian gang, and Wanxing seemed willing to swap out, but there was a lack of counterparts. 266 April bars are still left, and 11,445 May bars. Trading in the market was extremely lively. The flames of covering short positions were exceptionally excited in the half-day. To sum up, Bingxing Daxingyong Yuanheng Hongli Fuchang Yongfeng Fuyu Yuanaoyong Tianfengyong Yuanchun Qingfa Yong etc. were all buyers. Shunli Yuankangxiang Richang Yuanshengyong Zhifengyong Yifengyong Ruixing Zhaofengchang Hengyu etc. were all sellers. The Dalian gang squeezed out. There were not many transactions in Guangbang Hengfeng. The total number of June bars was 23,702.</p>

<p>The April Term has Already Stopped Auctioning</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the April futures period has been stopped, and two days are being organized in preparation for settlement on the 28th. Temporarily, one month of May is being done in the market, and June futures will be added for auction starting today. Because Japanese troops are withdrawing from various routes and there are various related rumors on the market, short sellers suddenly panicked. The northern gangs and financial circles in the market both have needs, so the opening session surged vigorously due to short covering, with most rising by 1 yuan, and the least by 45 jiao. Sentiment was quite high, but its trend was almost determined in this first session throughout the day. After that, although trading in each session was not deserted, almost all used the opening session market price as the standard. For example, the ups and downs of the next session were mostly 23 jiao for those with more, and only 5 fen for those with less, with ups and downs being mutually visible among them. The afternoon opening mostly seemed to pull back a small 1 jiao or 1 jiao and a half, while the consolidated tax rose 5 fen, and demobilization rose 3 jiao, to make up for the deficiencies of the previous two sessions. The closing was still mutually visible high and low, with a difference of mostly 12 jiao, and only demobilization pulled back a small 4 jiao.

<p>The yarn market is slightly firm and the situation is still flat. Because of sluggish real demand, all parties feel economic difficulties, and purchasing power has greatly declined, resulting in increased inventories in various factories, and sentiment is trending lower. However, a portion, because the market has fallen for a long time, has a slight rise in the idea of ​​doing more. Inland factories slightly cashed out when it rose. In short, current yarn consumption is sluggish, and the world situation is not good, so there is still little optimism for the future.</p>

<p>The man-made cotton market opened the previous market, and the market atmosphere was slightly flat. There were fewer new throwers in the market, and each month fell by 2358 jiao. In the afternoon, there was a slight receipt of goods this month, rising by 1 yuan and 8 jiao. The forward period was driven and also rose by 467 jiao.

<p>The cotton market situation is slightly higher. Because after the delivery this month, the bulls' minds are at ease, and large households have bought in to do more, and the market atmosphere is slightly stronger. However, the yarn market is sluggish, and the factory's procurement of spot cotton is extremely sluggish. As for the situation of foreign cotton, it is flat, but because the exchange rate is constantly changing, the calculation of the silver market is still trending cheaper.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Zheng Cotton Market is Slightly Hot <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>

<p>Yesterday, US cotton initially fell due to foreign merchants selling out and bulls settling profits. Later, it returned due to a portion covering short positions.

<p>Yesterday, foreign silk prices suddenly turned down again. The New York Exchange opened at $1.45. The rise and fall of foreign silk prices per Chinese silk is always offset by the exchange rate, so there is no honor or disgrace. Today's transactions included 50 dan of Shandong Yellow Factory warp (13.15), priced at 670 yuan, and 100 dan of ordinary white factory warp (20.22) 78 uniformity degrees, priced at 672 yuan. The former was purchased by Lianna, and the silk was purchased by Ganli. The price rose slightly compared to the previous. Also, according to the Commodity Inspection Bureau's report, the total export of raw silk last week was 622 dan, and 378 dan of waste silk, for a total of 1,000 dan. However, the US bank last week paid nothing. The United States, which uses the most raw silk, is gradually reducing Chinese silk transactions, which is really not a blessing for the silk industry.

<h3 id="e255">Early and Late Silkworm Seasons in Zhejiang Are Both Unfavorable <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>(Jinhua) The silkworm season in Jinhua, Jianxi, Yiwu, Fenshui and other places is the earliest. This year, farmers have failed in silkworm farming for consecutive years. Due to economic bankruptcy, they have no funds to purchase seeds. Most of them hatch native species from their own reserves. After receiving the ants, the weather was strangely cold, with continuous rain. The development of the silkworm ants was delayed, and silkworm diseases broke out frequently. The early-season silkworms were mostly damaged due to the cold rain. White muscardine and black death disease were found. All types are supplemented with late silkworms. Currently, the first batch of early silkworms has completed the third molt, and the second batch of late silkworms has also completed the first molt and have been feeding on leaves for many days. However, after the weather turned sunny and warm, there were several days of cloudy and rainy weather, coupled with sultry heat. The silkworm rooms were unusually humid and hot, and silkworm jaundice started. The transmission was very rapid. The patients' silkworm bodies showed black spots and died. Occasionally, black water was excreted and rotted to death. They died with a strange odor. Silkworm farmers felt pessimistic.</p>
<p>(Tongxiang) The silkworm season in the four villages is relatively late. In the past two years, farmers have suffered heavy losses due to poor harvests of silkworm cocoons. Therefore, this year's breeding parties are very disheartened. Coupled with the cold weather and slow germination of mulberry leaves, this year's silkworm season is even later, and the economy is bleak. They have no funds to purchase seeds. Now, only those who retain soil stability in Jingtang Bridge Yuxi and Gujia Port are engaged in hatching. Few people raise silkworms in Xinqiao and Tingzi Bridge. The weather was extremely cold during hatching, and thermal power was used to supplement the temperature (commonly known as fire silkworms). The collection of ants was uneven. The early gang had just started feeding after the first molt, and the late gang had just come out of the ants. The weather has been changing in recent days, sometimes sunny and sometimes rainy. The humidity is high, and the development of silkworm ants is not healthy.</p>
<h3 id="e256">Suian Rough Tea Has Been Weighed <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>Suian green tea has been picked one after another in various mountain gardens in recent days. According to a letter from Suizhuang yesterday, this year's new tea is unusually fine and tender, and the aroma is even better than in previous years. The first batch of rough tea has been weighed sporadically, and the price per load ranges from 90 yuan to 95 yuan, which is not much different from last year on average. However, local tea shops are very eager to advance, and many guest gangs have gathered to rush to handle it, so the market outlook is expected to rise.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Six More Tea Houses Added in Yushan <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Yushan green tea in Jiangxi Province. Last year, many merchants in various villages made considerable profits. As a result, tea shops and tea houses are extremely interested in this year's business. Currently, in addition to the original 24 tea houses, six more have been added, and the situation is quite lively.</p>
<h3 id="e258">Foodstuffs: Polished Rice Prices Increase by 10-20 Cents <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Over twenty wholesale houses have been sourcing rice, and local shops are moderately stocked. However, the market cannot be described as thriving. As sources continue to be scarce, market conditions are gradually tightening. Rice prices from Suzhou, Tongzhou, and the southern ports have risen by five cents to a dime. Although there is some demand for the new crop in the local shops, the majority is pre-ordered. Around 1400-1500 bags are being handled by agents from Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and other areas, as well as goods from Qingjiao, Songjiang, and Lianxiang. As a result, the situation is favorable, and prices are rising by the dime. Specifically, premium goods from Qingjiao and goods from Western Lianxiang are the most sought-after. The outflow of rice remains robust, with prices rising by two dimes. However, market sentiment suggests it is becoming sluggish, as there is concern that prices may not continue to rise significantly in the near future. The price of "Du Yang Jian" rice is similar, with mixed-quality goods slightly inferior in price to the previous session. However, "Yin Yuan" rice, particularly the fragrant variety, is in short supply, and the market is brisk, with prices rising by a dime.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, sixteen or seventeen wholesale houses supplied the market from various routes along the river. White polished rice shops were cautiously engaging in limited transactions. The market appeared stable at high prices, with mid-range qualities slightly softer. Early new rice arrivals and sales were balanced, with prices holding steady. There were no significant gains or losses. "Yin Bian Yuan" remained at its original price.</p>
<h3 id="e259">Foreign Rice Sales Remain Weak <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Foreign traders are keen to sell; importers are hesitant.</p>
<p>Wenzhou agents are buying Jing rice, with prices rising by eight cents.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was quiet, and customer rice also appeared soft due to hesitant purchases by customer agents. Foreign traders are primarily focused on selling. Foreign rice inventories remain high, and after continuous promotions, all foreign traders are interested in selling. Yesterday, "Xiang Mao" was also willing to sell, but customer demand was weak. Agents from Ningbo tentatively sold a small batch of 100 bags from "Xiang Mao" at a price of 7.3 yuan. No other transactions were opened. With ample customer rice stocks and the pressure from foreign traders seeking to sell foreign rice, importers are hesitant, indicating they will only import in small quantities. Subsequently, sellers lowered prices by three to five cents, and transactions began to pick up. It is estimated that 760 bags of late Jiangxi rice from Fuzhou were sold at prices ranging from 8.09 yuan to 8.02 yuan. 2200 bags of Hunan coarse red rice were sold at prices ranging from 7.02 yuan to 7.00 yuan. Another 70 bags of red rice were sold at 7.10 yuan. Agents from Wenzhou purchased 400 bags of Nanjing Che rice for the second time at a price of 7.28 yuan, which is eight cents higher than the previous week.</p>
<h3 id="e260">Flour Futures Decline <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, prices turned flat and weak again for all months. Quoted prices for foreign wheat fell by around five, six, or seven dimes. Despite the price increase in foreign wheat in the previous days, sentiment remained unfavorable. Yesterday, the price of foreign wheat had already fallen, making the market weak, as can be imagined. However, factories were unwilling to sell due to the decline in the price of foreign wheat. Therefore, although the situation was unfavorable, the decline was not significant. When the market opened in the afternoon, prices for the current month suddenly declined sharply because the end of the month was approaching, and most outside buyers had to close their positions. Factories, on the other hand, were confident and remained calm. As a result, prices declined step by step, eventually falling to 2.415 yuan. Sentiment for May, June, and July was also unfavorable, while prices for August and September remained stable because factory selling was slow. However, the price of Argentinian foreign wheat continued to fall, reportedly reaching as low as 4.4 yuan. Therefore, the outlook for the long term remains uncertain. As a result, the price for the current month declined by 1.25 cents compared to the previous day. The price for May declined by 0.75 cents, June and July by 0.25 cents, and August and September remained unchanged.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Foreign Wheat Prices Decline, Domestic Wheat Temporarily Lacks Appeal <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market trended towards flatness and weakness again. Trading in the current month was slow due to the approaching settlement, and it is rumored that several truckloads of foreign wheat will be delivered. There was no trading in May and June. Due to the decline in foreign wheat prices, sentiment in July, August, and September was depressed, but selling was not heavy, and the decline was not significant. Given the current weakness of foreign wheat, domestic wheat prices temporarily lack appeal. At present, it is not only economical, but Argentinian wheat is even cheaper than the standard, so the timing for the new wheat harvest should be studied. As a result, the price for July declined by two cents, August by three cents, and September by one cent. There were no other changes.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Oil Market Rises with Production Prices <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>The bean market is stable, with limited supply and some movement in demand from factories. Export traders from Fujian and Guangdong are making occasional purchases, so the market is stable. However, sales are not strong, and there are concerns about overstocking. Soybean oil sales in various regions this spring are good. Listed prices are slightly lower, so transactions are smooth. Recently, prices in the production areas have risen, leading to a slight decrease in supply, so wholesale prices have also risen by one or two dimes in response.</p>
<h3 id="e263">North and South Goods: Orchid Bamboo Branches are Expensive and Scarce <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>The arrival of orchid bamboo branches has been limited recently. However, most of the arrivals are of ordinary quality, so they are difficult to price. Recently, the listed price for assorted brands was 22.4 yuan, but the price of later arrivals has not been announced. Trade prices for carefully selected good quality goods are reportedly 27-28 yuan.</p>

<p>Recently, various types of thick and thin raincoat fabrics have sold briskly in the market, especially single-sided "Kai Shui Mei". However, the market remains weak because there is an oversupply of inventory in Shanghai, and traders are competing to cut prices. Yesterday, the wholesale price of first-quality "Yuan Chang" blue-gray elephant skin lined thin raincoat fabric was reduced to 3.9 yuan per yard, second quality to 3.45 yuan, "4026 Zheng Zhen" first-quality war surface "Kai Shui Mei" was sold at 4.9 yuan, ordinary first-quality at 4.75 yuan, second quality at 4.6 yuan, and third quality at 4.15 yuan.</p>

<p>The tinplate market has been excellent recently due to limited arrivals and strong demand, so prices are rising steadily. As a result, all traders dealing in this product are making substantial profits. However, overseas orders have increased as a result. Since factories cannot supply enough to meet demand and exchange rates have increased, prices continue to rise. The prices quoted by foreign firms are listed below for reference:</p>

<h3 id="e268">Two Major Obstacles to the Future of National Products <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Yang'an</p>
<p>Promoting national products, using national products, everyone knows it, everyone talks about it, everyone does it. But observing the current situation, there are two major obstacles to the future of national products, which must be actively removed and resolved during this National Products Year.</p>
<p>(1) The Decline of the Rural Economy: The largest source of national products is the countryside, and the largest outlet for national products is also the countryside. Today, the Chinese countryside shows signs of decline everywhere, which is a major hidden worry for the future of national products. If we examine the rural areas everywhere, eight or nine out of ten farmers lack purchasing power. Although the influence of national products is gradually penetrating the interior, everyone knows that national products are inexpensive and of good quality, and everyone can say that Chinese people should use Chinese goods. But what can be done when they are as empty as a chime and have nothing but bare walls? They lack the purchasing power. Therefore, promoting national products in the National Products Year, before the most urgent problem of the decline of the rural economy is resolved, no matter how hard the publicity is, no matter how intense the work is, I am afraid that the result will be half the effort and minimal results. The immediate prerequisite is to hope that the national financial and industrial circles will take it as their responsibility to help the rural areas. How to study the improvement of seeds and planting, the improvement of agricultural tools and fertilizers, the improvement of rural life, the implementation of rural cooperation, as well as farmer loans, farmer entertainment, farmer education, farmer side business, etc., should all be done with the greatest effort and the greatest determination, wholeheartedly to help, and fully assist. If the rural economy can be resolved, then the farmers' productivity will naturally increase, and the source of raw materials will naturally feel convenient. The farmers' purchasing power will naturally be strong, and the outlet for products will naturally be large. The financial sector's circulation is flexible, and the industrial sector's business development is saving people is saving oneself, and benefiting people is benefiting oneself. This is one.</p>
<p>(2) The Invisible Best-Selling of Japanese Goods: Everyone knows how to boycott inferior goods, everyone can talk about it, everyone can do it, but there is no way to prevent the sale of inferior goods, no way to prevent unscrupulous merchants from selling, and no way to prevent inferior goods from penetrating the interior. Speaking of gatherings to boycott, the previous examples of anti-Japanese associations and anti-Japanese associations are chilling. Giving up eating because of choking is heart-wrenching. Try going to the market. It is clearly a Japanese product, but it is labeled as made in the United Kingdom, made in Germany, made in Italy. It is clearly a Japanese product, but it has changed its appearance, changing the sun logo to the Chinese brand. If people abandon their conscience, what can't be done? The flesh of unscrupulous merchants can be eaten, and the hearts of unscrupulous merchants can be punished. I hope that our merchants will no longer hear or ask, and let the inferior goods be like a broken bamboo, as if entering no one's land? This is the way of suicide. In the end, the future of our national products will be bleak. Therefore, today, people in the national products industry should not think that boycotting inferior goods is the government's business or society's business. They only know how to manufacture national products, only want their own business, and ignore the prevalence of inferior goods and the cunning of unscrupulous merchants. This is a big mistake. The only problem at present is to unite fair people, have a legitimate association, and make a whole counterattack, and not stop until the goal of driving out inferior goods from the Chinese market is achieved. Alas, the national disaster is deep. People often say that the government is not reliable, and the military power cannot resist it. Only economic strangulation is possible from the people. But now, even this economic resistance is impossible? What else can be said? What else can be said?</p>
<p>Scientific Management</p>
<h3 id="e269">The Prerequisite Steps for Implementing Scientific Management <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Yunxiang</p>
<p>The purpose of implementing scientific management is to seek precision in management and increase efficiency in order to achieve greater goals. In other words, it is to make social economy progress, stable and healthy. Leaders in the industry must have the spirit of serving the society in order to guide the industry to the right path and achieve the effect of labor-capital cooperation. This mission is extremely great and cannot be achieved by using improper means to seek temporary small profits without regard to the common welfare of both labor and capital.</p>
<p>In the implementation plan of scientific management, there are several systems and steps that must be stipulated in advance in order to establish the foundation of the business and the foundation of management. These systems and steps are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Stipulate the Organization System (Plan of Organization), from the general manager to the workers, their respective functions, powers and responsibilities, and the relationship between each other must be clearly stipulated to avoid misunderstandings and conflicts in handling affairs, and avoid the abuse of irresponsibility and evasion.</p>
<p>(2) Stipulate a simple notation and number (Mnemonic Classification) for a business to determine the name and save the work of copying.</p>
<p>(3) Stipulate a periodic reporting system (System of Reports) to enable the manager to understand the progress of the business and to have a reliable basis for improvement.</p>
<p>(4) Stipulate an accounting system (Accounting System) suitable for all parts of management as a tool for management. (5) Stipulate a standard activity budget system (Flexible Budgetary System), the standard must meet the standard of production, as well as the different standards of indirect consumption between the various parts.</p>
<p>(6) Stipulate a procurement system (Purchasing System) to meet the needs of manufacturing engineering and economy.</p>
<p>(7) Stipulate a market and sales analysis system (Market and Sales Analysis) to facilitate the implementation of sales plans and management systems.</p>
<p>(8) Stipulate a plan and management system for production improvement (Planning &amp; Control of Product)</p>
<p>(9) Stipulate an engineering plan management system (Planning &amp; Control of Engineering)</p>
<p>(10) Stipulate the standards of machinery (Standardization of Equipment)</p>
<p>(11) Stipulate a system for the receipt, storage and delivery of various materials (System for Receipt, Storage &amp; Delivery of Materials)</p>
<p>(12) Stipulate the production plan and management system (Planning and Control of Production), from the order to the shipment, whether it is in stock or customized.</p>
<p>(13) Stipulate the mechanical repair system (Maintenance of Plant) for inspection and repair, in order to avoid the loss of temporary stagnation and the occurrence of danger.</p>
<p>(14) Stipulate a graded salary system (Graded Schedule of Salaries and Wages) based on the nature, importance and responsibility of the work.</p>
<p>(15) Stipulate an incentive bonus system (Incentive Pay), the standard must be determined by motion and time analysis.</p>
<p>(16) Stipulate an employee merit and demerit record system (Employee Record) to cultivate talent and promote and increase salaries.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned sixteen systems must be connected to each other, like the parts of a clock, closely connected, otherwise only its form will be obtained, but not its spirit, which is equivalent to being useless. Therefore, any national product factory that wants to adopt scientific management must first look at its original level of management and reorganize it to establish a foundation. However, this is not easy either. Just taking the stipulation of the above systems as an example, it will take at least several years to complete. As for a factory whose original management situation is chaotic, it is really difficult to implement scientific management suddenly in order to achieve quick results.</p>

<h3 id="e271">Management System and National Products Movement (Part 2) <a href="#e271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— Gu Yuan</p>
<p>The people's supplies are self-produced and self-sufficient, and there is no concept of using foreign goods. We only need to look at the equipment in the old-fashioned stores to understand. The account books for collecting and paying, the inkstone, pen, ink, abacus, book clips and other supplies are all local products. However, since the reform, these old-fashioned things have been abandoned with the change of the management system. The banks can best show this phenomenon. Bank accounting is new-style bookkeeping, and because of the horizontal writing and the use of international numbers, foreign paper must be used. The cloth-bound or leather-bound covers, as well as the related fountain pens, pencils, inks, and paper, are all foreign goods. Even the abacus, a special product of our country, is replaced by a computer of foreign origin. In this way, the management system is completely new: however, abandoning national products and using foreign goods to increase trade deficits is a very serious issue. Even the newer the management system, the more Westernized the items used. Therefore, in a certain sense, the abnormal reform of the management system is a very uneconomical thing. In fact, the people concerned did not intentionally want to Westernize, but really felt that under the new management system, all supplies were more convenient to be Western-style. From this point of view, the problem still lies in our inability to manufacture equipment ourselves. Chinese people have always been casual in nature. The old-fashioned management system focused on (people). Many large-scale stores had no documents or records for all handling procedures to rely on. They were accustomed to it and did not feel inconvenient. The new management system focuses on (system); for example, each payment has a voucher, which is passed on in order, so that each person in charge can sign and be responsible. Another example is the sale of goods, from unloading to delivery, there is a document for each procedure in the middle. And the documents often have to be copied with a pencil. Domestic paper is soft and fragile, so foreign paper has to be used. In this way, the more rigorous the system, the more foreign goods are used. In recent years, the industrial and commercial circles have reformed the new management system, which cannot but be said to be an evolutionary phenomenon in the meaning of the times; however, we cannot deny that the abuse of increasing the amount of foreign goods sold is a peculiar abnormality of China.</p>
<p>We believe that our country's inherent management system is scattered and lax, and there is no value in preserving it. Research and improvement is the most urgent task. However, all equipment is considered to have the necessity of adopting national products as much as possible. It is best to improve the old-fashioned equipment so that it can still be applied to the new system, or to manufacture the new equipment ourselves. In this way, although the system is new, it can still adapt to the domestic environment without abuse. We hope that people who study the management system and promote national products will pay attention to it.</p>

<h3 id="e274">The New Path for National Products Enterprises <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Songtang</p>
<p>In recent times, the progress of national products has been rapid. It is a very optimistic phenomenon. However, if we examine why there is such a new trend, we should attribute it to the old efforts of the pioneers of the national products industry to make progress and the considerable price they paid for their hardships. Observing since last year, the national product factories have strived to unite and coordinate, and various new combinations have opened up a new life for the future of our national products. In the future, we should promote it and follow this as the goal. I will now describe it separately for my newly emerging production factories.</p>
<p>The establishment of the Production and Sales Cooperation Association is actually the beginning of mutual assistance between the production industry and the merchants, and it is the basic work to solve the people's livelihood problems. It is the only shortcut to strive for property construction, and the strongest weapon to prevent the invasion of imported goods. The Production and Sales Cooperation Association, which bears this important mission, has gathered domestic talents in one hall, racking their brains and worrying, studying how to block imported goods, and how to promote domestic products. On the one hand, they pay attention to improving products and strive for the progress of material forms. They concentrate their energy. Each meeting often takes half a day, but they are still tirelessly.</p>
<p>The Establishment of China National Products Company: The Production and Sales Association has seen that the major companies and small shops in the country all show off imported goods to attract people's attention. They all think that national products are not easy to sell and the benefits are thin. Their eyes are short-sighted and difficult to wake up, so there is an organization of a purely perfect China National Products Company. Gather the national essence in one hall to live up to the people's expectations. At the beginning of the start-up, the business has been booming, which is enough to show that the Chinese people had the heart to love the country but had no place to buy in the past. We hope that the citizens will resolutely use national products to support this emerging national product business. We also hope that the service personnel of the National Products Company will pay attention to the output of the production industry on the one hand, and also hope to take care of the needs of consumers. Therefore, the China National Products Company is indeed a valuable record in the history of the national products movement. This is the success of the first act of the Production and Sales Cooperation Association.</p>
<p>National Products Introduction Institute Project: The Production and Sales Association has established a considerable economic barrier in Shanghai, which is attracting worldwide attention. In order to promote its efficiency, it plans to penetrate into various places, so there are national products introduction institutes in various places, and the Shanghai General Institute is the culmination of its efforts. The task is to distribute the products to the markets in various places through introduction, investigate consumption conditions, list national product samples, and strive to make Chinese people recognize national products, distinguish national products, and purchase standards, so that producers do not have to wait for sale, and sales personnel save the trouble of selection. Merchants in various places will have such a sound organization, saving a lot of trouble, time and energy. It can be said that the mission of the Production and Sales Cooperation Association is the motive of the mobile sales team. The Production and Sales Cooperation Association has been thoughtful and has proceeded step by step in establishing national products companies in major cities and establishing national products introduction institutes in various places, and has done its best. However, over the years, we have often seen the aggressive sales methods and official propaganda policies of foreigners, which are carried out from the metropolis to the town, from the town to the village. Even the poor and remote areas have been reached, which can be said to be meticulous and far-reaching. Looking back, the Chinese people only know how to focus on the metropolis and ignore the remote areas. They sit idly by and watch the good markets in the towns and villages being occupied by foreign forces, which is one of the major reasons for the obstacles to the future of national products. Therefore, there is the motive of the mobile sales team, with hard-working personnel, hiring boats to travel around, promoting everywhere, and selling goods at will, so that the village girls can also see the truth of national products, which is a very good method.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned is indeed a new contribution of the China Production and Sales Cooperation Association in the past year, which is to seek the stability and progress of the national products factory business. Therefore, in order to seek progress, it depends on uniting comrades, uniting spirits, and jointly establishing a sound foundation and striving for sound facilities, in order to live up to the expectations of all parties.</p>

<p>Indeed, in order to be suitable for the trend of the times.</p>
<p>We should work harder to consolidate and enrich the internal aspects of each individual. We also hope that the emerging factories should communicate with each other, and the people in various places should work together to benefit others and themselves. The key is to unite and concentrate. It is not difficult to reach the road to light together and get closer to the way to save the country.</p>
<h3 id="e275">The Support That the Domestic Goods Movement Should Have <a href="#e275" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c275" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">275</a></h3>
<p>— Ms. Bai Xue</p>
<p>On the surface, the domestic goods movement seems to have reached a considerably concrete and successful stage. Large factories and large domestic goods companies have sprung up one after another and are no longer uncommon. However, when we examine the reality, we still feel that it is in its infancy. For example, the tools for manufacturing domestic goods, that is, the objects for manufacturing objects—machinery—mostly rely on foreign supply. Some raw materials (like the finest yarn, rayon, etc.) are also purchased from abroad. The management systems of industry and commerce are also reluctantly imitating the superficial aspects of foreign countries. Whether they can adapt to the environment and needs of our domestic goods movement is still a question worth discussing.</p>
<p>The domestic goods movement should be practical and realistic and meet the needs of the nation. It should not be exclusively westernized, because this may hinder the progress of the domestic goods movement.</p>
<p>So, what is the support for the domestic goods movement?</p>
<p>(1) Scientific Support: The 20th century is an era of science. A country without science will inevitably gradually decline, leading to national subjugation. Look at our China: science is equal to zero. Large-scale enterprises (like electrical engineering, chemical engineering, manufacturing machinery, etc.) all rely on foreign countries for support. Therefore, the domestic goods movement must first cultivate great scientists to invent and create all kinds of machinery, chemical, and other large projects. In this way, the domestic goods movement can succeed, and the Chinese nation can have a country with domestic goods.</p>
<p>(2) Government Support: In addition to cultivating and rewarding scientists, the government should also help and build large industries. It should plan the whole country comprehensively: how to resist foreign goods? How to make the domestic goods movement a success and create a completely domestic goods-based country? How can we promote domestic goods to foreign countries? ···These are all the responsibilities of the government.</p>
<p>(3) Public Support: Now we are so oppressed by imperialism that we can hardly breathe, but some people still promote foreign goods and disregard domestic goods. This is a path to self-destruction. Therefore, the people should wake up and not buy foreign goods, but completely use domestic goods, so that Chinese-made domestic goods can be enjoyed by the Chinese themselves.</p>
<p>The above three are interrelated and cannot be separated and carried out independently. The three must advance together in unity.</p>
<p>Discussion of Domestic Goods</p>
<h3 id="e276">A Word for the Domestic Goods Industry <a href="#e276" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c276" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">276</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>(Imitation is a bad habit of the Chinese!) Foreign friends often mock us like this. Even we Chinese ourselves often laugh at each other and gossip about it.</p>
<p>You should know that the word "imitation" is the most inappropriate word. As long as you are imitating, you will never succeed in anything. Because at best, it's just imitation!</p>
<p>The domestic goods industry in its infancy is committing the fault of "imitation." Although it cannot be said to be the majority, in my observation, it is not a small number! There is also a reason for this, which I deeply understand. Whenever a foreign product comes to China, it is popular in Shanghai, and gradually it also appears in the inland areas. When it appears in the inland areas, and it can be said that a certain foreign product is widespread, our domestic goods manufacturers then imitate that product and put it on the market. At that time, we Chinese are already accustomed to using that certain foreign product. Even if the imitation of domestic goods is as guaranteed to be similar and as solid, they will not have a need for it. Those with more discerning eyes also seem unlikely to patronize it. You should know that this is not because the Chinese do not trust Chinese goods, but because Chinese domestic goods manufacturers despise themselves too much and work as slaves for foreigners. As a result, some domestic goods manufacturers with small capital often stop halfway because the imitation of one or two foreign products does not achieve "amazing sales." This situation is not uncommon.</p>
<p>I believe that in order to avoid repeating the same mistakes, it is necessary to first hire specialized</p>
<p>talents and focus on "creation."</p>
<p>"Creative" products will definitely gain the approval of our Chinese people. Just look at a certain foreign product coming to China. It must be something never seen before, so curious Chinese people, you buy it, I buy it, and thus the producer of foreign goods succeeds in one fell swoop and sees great results, importing batches of them quickly, and we Chinese do not hesitate to use our great national treasures, thousands and tens of thousands, to pay tribute to foreigners.</p>
<p>Let's not mention anything else, let's take the XX flashlight as an example. When it first came to China, only people in Shanghai bought it for use. Now, in remote rural areas, almost ten people have one each. Although the Chinese imitate, and there is not just one producer, the sales of that foreign product are still not weaker than before, even with the imitations!</p>
<p>Thinking about this small example, if our Chinese producers continue to specialize in imitation and continue in this way without thinking about "creation," I think there is only the reality of regression and no possibility of progress!</p>
<p>Domestic goods producers who like to imitate but have no results! This is my advice. Please do not overlook it hastily. If you implement my words, eliminate imitation in the future and implement creation, and manufacture products that are extremely modern, I can guarantee that your products will definitely cater to the psychology of the Chinese people, and then you can truly achieve "amazing sales"! But don't forget these last few words!</p>
<p>(1) For the first product, if there are any inappropriate places, you must request the opinions of the purchasers and improve it.</p>
<p>(2) The product must be consistent from beginning to end, only improving and not deteriorating.</p>
<p>(3) If the cost of raw materials increases due to market prices, the pricing must not be deliberately raised, because it can be mutually balanced.</p>
<p>(4) Advertising is to assist the promotion of products and cannot be underestimated. It is necessary to hire a specialized talent to be in charge.</p>
<h3 id="e277">The Entire Economic Strategy of Domestic Goods Factories <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Ying</p>
<p>(1) Current Crisis: Chinese domestic goods factories are extremely immature. At this time of economic warfare, with short weapons meeting and blades crossing, how should our domestic goods factories carefully protect and cultivate them, so that this sprout can grow into a tall tree? Because the usual communication has not been proper enough, enemy goods take advantage of it, using their tactics of horizontal and vertical alliances, and their tricks of instigation and division, and our domestic goods factories all fall into the trap. Suspicion arises, and the trend of infighting begins, so they do not hesitate to compete in price cuts to attract customers, and indiscriminately release credit to broaden their reach. Internal war is not over, and domestic goods internal war arises again. If this continues, in a few years, people will be searching for my dried fish in the market.</p>
<p>(2) Relief Methods: The crisis of domestic goods is imminent. To seek relief, the first thing to do is to establish self-criticism and jointly plan for unity. However, unity does not advocate empty talk but emphasizes practicality, and does not value form but cherishes spirit. Joint sales, there have been those who have done it before, and the effect of the length is roughly visible. For the current plan, only further and most thorough unity is the best way to eliminate boundaries and unite as one family. The external business is the same for each other, the observation and listening are unified, and the atmosphere is naturally new. For each type of domestic goods factory, select a brand with better reputation and use it to achieve twice the result with half the effort. The assets of each factory are fairly estimated, and stocks are issued according to their value. The battle formation is unified, the military appearance is revitalized, the fault is removed, and clarity comes naturally.</p>
<p>(3) Management Strategies: The operation of industry generally values the exquisite production, especially the corresponding supply and demand, adapting to local conditions, establishing branch factories, scattered like stars, able to respond to each other, promoting the products, each near the ground, the freight is saved, and the cost is lighter. Compared to gathering in one corner, piles of old goods, land and sea transportation, often takes months, seizing the time and tending to profit, I have no ability to do it, the difference is not like heaven and earth.</p>
<p>(4) Profit Forecast: The united strength of the same industry is naturally powerful. When enemy goods come to invade, it is enough to fight a battle, the first benefit. The same industry united lending, at least the annual interest rate is considerable, the second benefit. Retail purchase of raw materials, the value is relatively large, since the united, you can buy in bulk at 80% discount calculation, the profit is not small, the third benefit. The same industry factories are separated from each other, the mechanical equipment, are not economical, since the united, the disadvantages are eliminated, the fourth benefit. The staff of each factory, often easy to flow, since the united, the mind is focused, and training is easy to become, the fifth benefit.</p>
<p>The same industry factories implement the union, the silk weaving industry, has seen the end, other factories, or more doubt, use the general description, by when the advocacy.</p>
<p>Domestic Goods Introduction</p>
<h3 id="e278">Nantong's Flourishing "Avenge Shame" Cloth <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Senfu</p>
<p>Before introducing the "Avenge Shame" cloth, I will first describe its cause and origin: Nantong's agricultural products are mainly cotton, so the villagers mostly use weaving cloth as their only sideline. The cloth is white in color and durable in texture, so it has long been famous. Its largest market is the northeastern provinces, so the cloth shops in Tongcheng are also called "Guandong Shops." Since the September 18th Incident, when the invaders invaded and occupied the Northeast, sales plummeted. When the puppet state was established, customs duties were autonomous, and the tax rate on Tong cloth was increased by more than three times, so sales disappeared. If this continues without any consideration, wouldn't the livelihood of Nantong's weavers be completely cut off? However, the weavers did not lose heart because of this setback, but most of them automatically widened their old looms and changed to weaving plain-colored cloth with wide doorways. They were also able to carefully research and were actively promoted by various cloth shops. For a time, it became a whirlwind. After repeated discussions, today's achievements were made. The name "Avenge Shame" is taken to show the determination to avenge the national shame. The raw material for this cloth is 20-count yarn produced by the Dasheng Yarn Factory. This yarn is spun by Tonghua. The fiber length of Tonghua is 15/16 of an inch, which can spin 32-count yarn. Now Dasheng is adding a bleaching and dyeing factory, planning to dye the spun yarn into colored yarn using scientific methods, specializing in selling it for weaving "Avenge Shame" cloth, in order to make the colors bright and the quality consistent. This cloth is specified to be 7.5 zhang (old system of measurement) in length, about 5 jin and 10 liang in weight, 2.2 chi in width, and 4.67 yuan in value. It has already been sold in Jiangnan and Jiangbei and Jiahu in Zhejiang. There are also large orders in Xiamen and Shantou in Minyue. Now 1-2 thousand pi are shipped out every day. Recently, it has been heard that the wholesale goods are all sorted, packed, and shipped by the Dasheng Yarn Factory, so the wholesale office of the factory also sells wholesale. It is also heard that its Shanghai office can also place bulk orders. I wrote this article to introduce this cloth because it is purely domestic and its name is quite inspiring.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Chinese Cotton Mills Reduce Labor <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Chengxun</p>
<p>Recently, in the past week, a drastic event broke out in the local industrial community: that is, although the Chinese cotton mills have been struggling to the extreme for a year, they still could not stand firm and announced a reduction in labor. The reason for the reduction in labor is because of disastrous business failures, overproduction, and the influence of strong foreign goods dumping. They had to take this policy of controlling production to survive. For the cotton mills themselves, this reduction in labor is still a way to ease the immediate situation and slowly plan for recovery. However, this unprecedented phenomenon of absolute passivity and contradiction is ultimately a bleak page in the history of domestic industries.</p>
<p>People in the cotton industry say that Chinese cotton is both more expensive and of much lower quality than foreign cotton. The current state of depression is really an example of how the Chinese do not seek improvement and lag behind in everything. It is not only the cotton industry that is like this, but other industries as well. It is really useless to have the government send people to negotiate for assistance after the fact. The fundamental problem lies entirely in the self-determination and self-awareness of the producers themselves.</p>
<p>Implementing a reduction in labor is only a short-term transitional step and cannot cure the long-standing weakness of the cotton industry. Even throwing bombs at traitorous merchants every day cannot force them to return to their bestial nature of specializing in the sale of enemy goods for profit. If Chinese cotton can quickly put in a lot of hard work, reduce costs, and improve quality, foreign goods will lack the ability to dump, and production will definitely not be excessive. At that time, there will be too late to increase labor, where will there be a reduction in labor?</p>
<p>I hope that in the near future, the cotton industry can open up a new situation.</p>
<p>Interview</p>
<h3 id="e280">The Zhong Ting Brothers <a href="#e280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— Lu Fengshi</p>
<p>Ten years ago, Yonghe Industrial Company was not yet of any scale. The situation was similar to the family industrial system of the Middle Ages. The entrepreneur occupied the dual position of employer and employee. It can be seen that this achievement cannot be called small.</p>
<p>Zhong Ting is the eldest, followed by Jiting, and then Xiangting. Perhaps they are practical people who are willing to hide their talents and do not want people to know about them. The reason why I wrote this article can be said to be</p>
<h3 id="e281">The Pyrethrum Farm of the Chinese Chemical Industry Society (Matsuzeng) <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>is based on two major viewpoints: (1) The Ye brothers have made practical contributions to the development of domestic goods. The most obvious example is the use of "Chang'e" brand toothpaste to clear away the remnants of "Diamond" toothpaste, an enemy product that was dumped across the country. (2) Among the many wealthy merchants, there are quite a few who have made their fortunes by luck, while Yonghe Industrial Company is the final crystallization of the Ye brothers' success from scratch, working day and night in rough workers' clothes.</p>
<p>I will also make public a story with many twists and turns, tracing back to their childhood life. From this, readers can also be sure that a difficult environment is the future opportunity, as long as you can turn resistance into assistance, then pain can be transformed into happiness.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhong Ting is from Qingyang Town, Jiangyin. His father was in the rice business and was also a poor man. One New Year's Day, Mr. Zhong Ting was still very young and received a small silver dollar as New Year's money. He was unwilling to spend it and quickly treasured it. After about half a year, the family suddenly hesitated over the issue of buying things, and he took out his only private savings. How could ordinary children do this?</p>
<p>When he first came to Shanghai to learn a trade, he was simply learning to be a nanny, washing rice, cooking, and looking after children, doing everything. He was able to endure it and did not complain at all. After three years, he was promoted to be a salesman. He was honest and responsible, so he attracted a lot of business. An elder, unwilling to bury his talents, provided him with several hundred yuan of capital and strongly advised him to start his own business. At that time, he witnessed Japanese cosmetics dominating the Chinese market, so he started a small-scale home industry, named Yonghe, which probably meant "Eternal Harmony for Generations, Sharing Great Business." However, we can also imagine that the brothers and sisters-in-law at that time were enough to encompass the two major classes of employer and employee.</p>
<p>Jiting graduated from the Jiangsu Third Normal School. Later, the small handicraft industry had become a small factory. He had a way to manage the economy and hoped to stand out in the cosmetics industry. He finally studied in Germany and obtained a doctorate in chemistry. The "Yongmei" cream and powder that are now sold throughout the country are the result of his many years of experimentation. Xiangting is even more shrewd and capable, simple and hardworking. If we visit their factory, we simply cannot tell that he is one of the founders of Yonghe.</p>
<p>I would also like to briefly describe one or two aspects of their private virtue. This is indeed the only acupuncture for modern nouveau riche. They treat their teachers with true respect. They send gifts or visit every festival, and there is no bad habit of being carried away with success. This time, when the factory caught fire, the compensation for the affected workers was also doubled compared to other factories, with thick coffins and generous funerals, caring for the workers in every possible way.</p>
<p>Written plainly, readers will probably have some feelings. Throughout my life, I have never wanted to write flattering words, and the main motivation for this article is entirely based on the idea of "using the facts of untouched innocence to arouse readers' interest in business."</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Tu Zhemian was a very handsome son of a rich man, indulging in a leisurely and comfortable environment all day long. Although it was now a critical moment for the Republic of China, and everyone was worried about becoming a subjugated slave, he was still as calm as a Frenchman or an Italian who had nothing to do with the Republic of China, enjoying all the material supplies that his father had offered him to the fullest. His wife, Ms. Liu Shan, was a new woman with very noble thoughts, often donating her own money to the volunteer army and paying close attention to the war news at the front.</p>
<p>"I'm planning to make a new suit of clothes." One afternoon, this worthy couple, with different interests, came out of a restaurant on Nanjing Road after having snacks, and were slowly strolling along the sidewalk. Zhemian suddenly saw a piece of extremely exquisite fine tweed hanging in the display window of a tailor shop, and wanted to have a new suit made.</p>
<p>Liu Shan did not express whether she agreed or disagreed with his proposal, so she followed him into the store.</p>
<p>"Okay! Make a suit for me!" The texture was light and the color was good, and Young Master Yu was already satisfied. Without asking the shop assistant for the price, he prepared to pay the deposit.</p>
<p>The shop assistant, with a smile on his face, carefully measured his size with a tape measure. Suddenly, Young Master Yu thought of a question:</p>
<p>"Is this a Chinese product?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the quality is better than foreign goods, and the price is cheaper than foreign goods, sir, I guarantee you'll be satisfied!" the shop assistant replied sincerely.</p>
<p>"Ah! Chinese goods? Unreliable! Unreliable! It wrinkles as soon as you wear it, I don't want it!" Zhemian put the money he had already taken out back into his pocket, indicating that he was determined not to buy it!</p>
<p>"But, sir, how do you know if you haven't tried it?" the shop assistant tried his best to persuade him.</p>
<p>"No need to try, it will definitely wrinkle! What good things are there in Chinese goods!" Zhemian criticized extremely arbitrarily. At the same time, he had already taken Liu Shan's arm and intended to leave.</p>
<p>"Zhemian, may I ask what your surname is?" Ms. Liu suddenly asked this strange question.</p>
<p>"Of course my surname is Yu!"</p>
<p>"Surname Yu? Yu is the surname of the Chinese! Why do you change to a surname like "Washington" or "Roosevelt"?"</p>
<p>Ms. Liu's sharp rebuttal had already made Zhemian's face turn red, but the shop assistants were smiling triumphantly.</p>
<p>"Surname Yu? You are Chinese! Why don't you love Chinese goods? Why do you hate Chinese goods for no reason, you poor piece of subjugated slave material!" Ms. Liu hated him extremely. She felt that Zhemian's actions today had clearly proven that he had no sincerity in accepting the various exhortations she had given him on weekdays. She couldn't help but feel infinitely indignant, scolded a few sentences, and left angrily. The next day, Ms. Liu resolutely completed the divorce procedures with Young Master Yu, went north alone, and joined the ranks of the battlefield rescue team.</p>

<h3 id="e283">Go to the Countryside! <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>My opinion is slightly different from those of Mr. Xuan and Mr. Yang Xingzhi. I am biased towards "going back to the countryside."</p>
<p>There are now three types of countryside in China: (A) The countryside in Henan and Shaanxi has long become "villages without farmers." The county magistrate orders the planting of tobacco, and if you can't pay the tobacco tax, you get beaten. The young masters in the city eat Camel cigarettes, and the big girls in the countryside have no pants to wear. This kind of "village without farmers" is of course impossible to return to. (B) The countryside in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Anhui has big landlords and tenant farmers. Capitalism eats the big landlords, and the big landlords eat the tenant farmers again. This kind of countryside, which is on the verge of collapse, is also impossible to return to. But there is also a third type of countryside in China: (C) The countryside centered on self-cultivating farmers. For example, my hometown, the countryside in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River, has very few wealthy households with more than ten thousand gold. Self-cultivating farmers account for eight out of ten. It is not a utopia, but there is plenty of room for heroes to use their talents. If we can go back, we will absolutely not be disappointed.</p>
<p>What do we do when we return to the countryside? We organize self-cultivating farmers to fight a self-defense war. At present, capitalism has sucked the essence of Type A villages dry, and Type B villages have no sweetness to be had. Only Type C villages are seen as a fat piece of meat, and they want to devour it. If new terms like agricultural electrification become their means of stepping into the countryside, self-cultivating farmers will immediately be trampled under their feet. We must help self-cultivating farmers form strong groups and realize agricultural electrification through collective agricultural groups. If we enable self-cultivating farmers to maintain their own equipment, then capitalism will lose the opportunity to grab it. Once the opportunity turns, Type B villages will also have hope of a turnaround.</p>
<p>The establishment of a new society, no matter what process is used, must be followed by construction after destruction. Increasing the strength of Type C villages is laying the cornerstone for the rural economy. A new society that has escaped from famine will be able to restore its social order quickly, so fighting a self-defense war for self-cultivating farmers is fighting a self-defense war for a new society. Look at the power that consumer cooperative societies have contributed in the progress of the Soviet revolution. We cannot underestimate the power of Type C villages.</p>
<p>Of course, Type C villages also have gentry and scoundrels, but those are easy to deal with. Gentry and scoundrels need to borrow the tiger's power before they can act. They have no direct power to restrain self-cultivating farmers. If we stand with the self-cultivating farmers, we can win even without fighting.</p>
<p>Finally, I would also like to say two sentences that are close to slogans: (We go back to the countryside! We help self-cultivating farmers!)</p>
<h3 id="e284">Sanzi's Dad <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>As soon as Sanzi opened his eyes, he saw his dad just getting out of bed, holding a belt in his hand, his upper body still naked, and his blue cloth coat wrapped around the mat. He didn't know when his dad had come back last night. He fell asleep as soon as he lay down on the bed every day, and wouldn't wake up until dawn. Sanzi rubbed his eyes and got out of bed.</p>
<p>"This, you take it out today and paste it on the wall, throw it on the street, or in people's houses, whatever." Dad took out a stack of paper printed with words from under the mat. "Dad, is this what you said, the newspaper you guys made yourselves?"</p>
<p>"No, you put it under the oil paper in the basket, and don't let strangers see it."</p>
<p>Sanzi carried the basket of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks and walked to the open space near the train station. Five or six children had already arrived before him. They met in this place every day. None of those five or six children had a home. Some were because their dads had been crushed to death by machines in the factory. Some had collapsed and died on the road from pulling carts in the hot weather, and their mothers couldn't survive, so they abandoned their children and ran away, and some had committed suicide. Sanzi walked closer to them, lifted a corner of the oil paper in the basket, told them what his dad had said, and gave them a little bit each.</p>
<p>"Sanzi, we'll tell you something," Agou said quietly, making a funny face. "The son of the Zhang boss in that big Western-style house we talked about the other day, we plan to get him."</p>
<p>Little black faces were flashing with light, and they scattered. Sanzi carried the basket and walked the slowest. In his heart, he hoped that his dad would have this kind of thing for him to do again. He had many companions and would definitely do a good job.</p>
<p>Sanzi was really happy today. The thing his dad wanted him to do was really done well. And the sun hadn't reached the feet of the man who smoked every day on that big wall, and he had sold out his basket of sesame cakes and fried dough sticks. Counting it up, he also walked a lot less distance than usual. He hated the scorching sun the most.</p>
<p>Full of joy, he took a big step and turned a corner, but a rickshaw quickly bumped into him. He didn't have time to dodge, and the wheel had already crushed his toes. He was about to curse when he heard someone say, "Sanzi, why are you running so fast?" As soon as he heard the voice, he knew that the rickshaw puller was also his companion, Xiao Er. He quickly turned his head to look, and he was right. A pretty woman was sitting in the rickshaw, and the woman was holding a pretty little umbrella. He looked at Xiao Er's back and felt that he was luckier to sell sesame cakes than him.</p>
<p>He went home so happily. But his dad didn't come back that day. The next morning, as soon as he opened his eyes, he was the only one in the room. He went to ask the dad of Little Qizi next door. This man with a face full of black moles told him that his dad had been arrested by the police.</p>
<p>Sanzi's dad never came back from then on.</p>
<h3 id="e285">The Rice-Bowl-Eating Knives <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>In Jinhua, besides the eight classes of people—Party members, clergy, officials, farmers, laborers, merchants, students, and soldiers—there is also a special class who “eat rice with knives.” Those who "eat rice with knives" are all good fellows, eating well and dressing well, burning incense and worshiping deities, with a group of heroes as their comrades. These heroes and good fellows: those residents who obey them prosper, and those who defy them perish. In the past, those who "eat rice with knives" first had to kill without batting an eye. Second, they had to be killed without begging for mercy. The most important condition was that when angered, they would draw a snow-white knife and cut off a large piece of flesh from their own body, without even wrinkling their brows, wiping away blood, or uttering a single word of pain. In this way, once the qualifications for "eating rice with knives" were met, they could run rampant at will and be revered even after death. However, in recent years, such good fellows have become rare.</p>
<p>Nowadays, although these fellows still kill without batting an eye, they would never do the foolish thing of cutting off their own flesh, and they would certainly beg for mercy if they were about to be killed. The shortcut to "eating rice with knives" nowadays is first to desperately curry favor with the boss. Second, to flaunt their power against those weaker than themselves, and to be extremely cautious towards those stronger than themselves. Once these two conditions are met, they can then attach themselves to a wealthy gentleman, and for a reward of fifty or eighty dollars, go and kill a foolish person who is without wealth or courage and has unfortunately offended the wealthy gentleman.</p>
<p>It is said that the highest reward goes to those who can inflict ten or eight knife wounds, crippling a person so that they wish they could neither live nor die. Next is those who can inflict five or six knife wounds, rendering a person unable to speak or move their hands, writhing in a pool of blood, and dying after several days. The lowest reward goes to those who stab once, causing instant death, allowing the victim to die quickly and painlessly.</p>
<p>Valuing money and devaluing friendship, those who "eat rice with knives," although belonging to the proletariat, have wealthy masters, and their consciousness is the same as that of the propertied class, utterly disliking the poor, so they will not rebel.</p>
<p>Those who "eat rice with knives" are very useful to a group of wealthy gentlemen. Therefore, they are heroes.</p>

<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>丨To My Brother丨</p>
<p>Your train leaves at seven o'clock, and I left the platform before six thirty. It wasn't because I was afraid of missing the Pukou ferry, as that small steamer doesn't leave until seven twenty. You may have noticed that when leaving, I only shook your hand loosely and gave a faint smile before turning away. I didn't look back at you even once. But after leaving the station, I was unwilling to head towards the river. Hui and I walked slowly along that long corridor, walking back and forth several times without saying a word to each other. Suddenly, the sharp sound of a train whistle pierced my ears, followed by the sound of train wheels moving. I knew you were starting your journey north. Your gaunt face appeared vaguely before my eyes, and my heart began to ache faintly. I didn't shed tears, but my voice was already somewhat hoarse.</p>
<p>"(Let's go)," Hui urged, his voice sounding the same as mine. And so, we left Pukou. Thus, the past ten days of life completely disappeared behind us, and I felt as if I had awakened from a long dream.</p>
<p>You are returning to Tianjin. Before you boarded the train, others said that place was somewhat dangerous, advising you not to return there, but I didn't say a single word of dissuasion. It wasn't that I was unaware of the changes in the so-called anti-Japanese military situation these past few days, nor that I wasn't concerned about your safety. But I knew something else even better: you, like me, are destined to struggle in danger and hardship, and you have neither the opportunity nor the right to seek an easy life. The burden of life weighs upon your youthful shoulders, and a monthly salary of eighty yuan buys all your time. You have no freedom of thought, let alone freedom of action. From our conversations over the past ten days, I have already understood the entirety of your mundane and painful life.</p>
<p>Of course, you had two experiences like this the year before last. You yourself cannot fail to know that the place you are going to will change its colors very quickly, and perhaps you will even be forced to change your nationality there. But what can you do? In the name of prolonged resistance, people are breaking records for losing territory, people are shipping paintings and calligraphy overseas, people are moving antiques, people are levying aviation donations from you, people are announcing victory news in the newspapers every day, people are advocating "(aviation to save the nation)," "(dancing to save the nation)," "(entertainment to save the nation)," "(love to save the nation)," people, when not serving the Party and the nation, are gambling and playing with prostitutes, people... but you have to return to that place that is about to be abandoned for a monthly salary of eighty yuan.</p>
<p>"(What else can be done)?" There must be great sorrow hidden in the words you uttered with a smile. When you think of the things above, your heart must ache with grief and indignation, but if you think further, remembering the tens of thousands of people in that area who have been forgotten by the prolonged resistance and are groaning and struggling under guns and bombs, you may feel that your own fate is not so miserable after all. Perhaps you will even abandon your mundane and painful life and throw yourself into their midst to do something for them. I think you will do this, because I saw that when you talked about the tens of thousands of people groaning and struggling under the iron hooves, your face, which had been ravaged by life, suddenly glowed, and your weary body suddenly filled with vitality. I know now what can still stir your weakening heart. But I am afraid, I am afraid that another big blow will shatter you completely. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e287">Carrot Top <a href="#e287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— By Jules Renard, Translated by Lin Qu</p>
<p>Chamber Pot (1)</p>
<p>Having made a mess in bed more than once, Carrot Top was very careful to take precautions every night. In summer, this was easy. At nine o'clock, when the Lepic family sent Carrot Top to bed, he would willingly go out for a stroll; and the night would pass without incident.</p>
<p>In winter, however, this walk became a chore. As soon as it got dark, he would take his first precaution when going to shut up the chickens, but this would not last until the next morning. After dinner, and a little more idle time, it was already nine o'clock, and it had been dark for a long time, and this darkness would continue endlessly. Carrot Top had to take a second precaution.</p>
<p>This evening, like many evenings before, he was considering.</p>
<p>"(Do I need to)?" he thought; "(or don't I need to)?"</p>
<p>Usually, either because there was indeed no room for retreat, or because the bright moonlight had bolstered his courage, he would always answer "(yes)." Occasionally, Lepic and his elder brother Felix also served as examples for him. Moreover, his need did not always force him to go far from home, to the ditch almost beside the road in the wilderness. Usually, he would mostly stop under the stairs; this depended on the nature of his need.</p>
<p>But tonight, dense raindrops sifted the windowpane, the wind had extinguished the starlight, and the walnut tree roared angrily in the pasture.</p>
<p>"(It doesn't feel like much)," Carrot Top concluded after careful consideration, "(I don't need to)."</p>
<p>After saying goodnight to everyone, he lit a candle and ran to his desolate and lonely room at the end of the corridor on the right. He took off his clothes, lay in bed, and waited for the Lepic family to come in to check on him. She tightened the blankets and blew out the candle in one go. She left him the candle, but not a single match. Then she locked him in the room, locking the door with a key from the outside. 丨丨 This was because he was afraid of the dark. Carrot Top initially savored the pleasure of being alone in the room. He enjoyed thinking in the darkness. He recalled the events of the day, he was glad he had safely escaped many difficulties, and he hoped to have the same luck again tomorrow. He hoped that for two days in a row, the Lepic family would not notice him, and he wanted to fall asleep peacefully with this fantasy.</p>
<p>He had just closed his eyes when he felt an unpleasantness he had experienced before.</p>
<p>"(This was inevitable)," Carrot Top thought to himself.</p>
<p>Others would get up at this time. But Carrot Top knew there was no chamber pot under the bed. Although the Lepic family would swear and deny it, she always forgot to give him a chamber pot. And since Carrot Top had already taken precautions, what use would a chamber pot be?</p>
<p>So Carrot Top, at the very moment he should have gotten up, continued to speculate.</p>
<p>"(Sooner or later I will have to give in)," he thought in his heart. "(The more I endure, the more I accumulate. But if I release it immediately, I will only release a little bit, and my body temperature will have time to dry the blankets. Based on experience, I am absolutely certain that Mom won't notice at all)."</p>
<p>Carrot Top alleviated his discomfort, very peacefully closed his eyes again, and began to fall asleep.</p>

<h3 id="e288">Only Afraid That China Will Not Perish <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>Since the Japanese army invaded Rehe, it seems that the whole country has been in a state of panic again. The telegrams such as "(requesting to fight against Japan)" and "(determined to resist)" are certainly busy, especially the officials and dignitaries who are fleeing east and west, even more busy and sweating profusely. Recently, Rehe has finally come to a complete end, which could have "(come to an end)," but the Japanese imperialists are still not satisfied. Judging from the fact that they asked for ancient books to be evacuated after the antiques and national treasures were moved out of Beiping, we know that Tianjin and Beijing are indeed in danger. Under the most effective "(consistent policy)," they are probably not very reliable, so the mouthpiece of imperialist hirelings, the literati and doctoral students, cannot but be sincerely fearful and busy, and even publicly publish so-called "(nothing more than that)" (opinions).</p>
<p>Regarding this doctoral student, we know him very clearly. "(In November of the year before last, he advocated that the government authorities should accept the five basic principles proposed by the Japanese government in the League of Nations and begin negotiations)," and "(in June of last year, he wrote an article advocating that the government should express its willingness to conduct negotiations with Japan based on the above five principles)," and now he has repeatedly stated: "(I firmly believe that no matter what method is adopted for negotiations with Japan, it must not violate the principles of the report and recommendations passed by the League of Nations at its General Assembly on February 24 this year)." This is said most clearly. In simple terms, it means that there is no other way except to sincerely and willingly "(directly negotiate)" with Japanese imperialism. Moreover, it is absolutely not allowed to "(fight desperately at the risk of death)," so he said "(I cannot go against my conscience and advocate war)."</p>
<p>Of course, this kind of "(opinion)" is very commendable under the current situation of "(strategic)" followed by "(luring the enemy in)," followed by "(defending)," followed by "(preparing to counterattack)," and if it really pleases the enlightened monarch, he will inevitably be appointed as a high-ranking official. The emperor is talented and saves the world, turns clouds into rain, and the sea is calm, and the world celebrates together.</p>
<p>However, the most regrettable thing is that "(expanding the national revolutionary war)" has become the most powerful argument in the country. The broad masses of people have recognized that only revolutionary war is the only way out for the Chinese nation, and only his group of high-level Chinese people will be so humble and lick the master's spittle with a wagging tail. Naturally, those heroes who swear to resist to the death will not dare to immediately cover up their flags and cease their drums. At least in the newspapers, they still have to solemnly "(deal with the enemy)." Therefore, people cannot but cover their noses and dare not smell this public opinion.</p>
<p>So, why does he make such a big fuss? In a word, he is only afraid that China will not perish.</p>
<p>Alas! Is this what is called "(when a country is about to perish, there must be monsters)?"</p>

<h3 id="e289">Laundress <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>｜Cannot Wash Away the Stains of the World｜</p>
<p>In the north of Shanghai, a small room at the end of an alley, full of garbage and the stinging stench of urine, is where the laundress struggles hard to make a living.</p>
<p>Every morning, the distant, wailing sound of the factory whistle is her accurate timepiece and the signal to start work. She pulls out a large lead bucket of clothes soaked in soapy water from the corner of the door, puts it close to the tap, and turns around to button her clothes. With both hands grabbing her bushy, sparrow's nest-like gray hair, she lifts another lead bucket and treads the desolate morning light to the tiger stove at the entrance of the alley to make hot water. In the old days, she couldn't even bear to part with the few coins for hot water. She only needed to soak the clothes in cold water from time to time, then lightly rub some soap on them, and brush them hard with a clothes brush, and they would be clean. But now she no longer has the strength, so she can only use hot water.</p>
<p>When the sun rises and there are cries of vegetable vendors at the entrance of the alley, and the manure cart is rumbling on the stone-paved road, she carries two buckets of clothes of uneven texture, walking and resting, to the open space on the right outside the alley to hang them out to dry. Once they are hung up, her head spins, and the houses around her seem to be spinning. So she wipes her forehead with her right hand, slowly sits on a piece of wood, takes two deep breaths, and then has the strength to look up at the sky to see if there are any rain-like clouds. Every time it rains, she is always in a fluster and doesn't have time to tidy up, causing her to stumble and fall. Sometimes she brings rags to patch, but since she broke her old glasses in a sudden rain one day, she has had to stop this incidental work of patching.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, before evening, she takes the clothes back in and carefully folds them, sorting out the owners. Her face, wrinkled like chicken skin, always shows some hard-won smiles. She has finally completed a day's work, reducing a journey in life. She uses a yellowish-brown turban, neatly wrapped, and walks out of the door, out of the alley, to deliver them to the door. When people take them and look carefully, they shout at her, "(Not bad, washed fairly clean!)" She then replies with one sentence: "(Are there any more to wash? It would be good to take them along!)" Regardless of the quality of the material, she takes seven coins for each piece of clothing and pants, and three coins for each piece of socks, pillowcases, and vests. As long as she doesn't calculate incorrectly, she never argues. Her eyes shine with the light of contentment, and she reaches out with a slight tremor to receive the money. When the money reaches her hand, she says, "(Thank you!)"</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>During the winter season, the weather is suddenly cold, and everyone is a little shivering, so the clothes are changed less frequently, but she still expects to work the same way, only her neck is a little shrunk. When she goes door to door to collect clothes,</p>
<p>When asked, or someone asks her why she is so unafraid of the cold and so able to endure hardship, she can be heard answering: "(The famine in my hometown drove me here? People say this place is paradise, but I still have to go hungry. When it comes to this time (winter), there is really only the north wind to drink! My husband pulls a rickshaw, but it can only feed his own mouth. Really, the poor only have the north wind to drink! Alas!)"</p>
<p>In fact, it is indeed somewhat like that. When winter comes, everyone is a little shivering, and clothes are changed less frequently, as if there is such a meaning:</p>
<p>Ah, poor laundress, you can only wash away the stains of the world?)</p>
<h3 id="e290">The Birth of the Silent Gourd <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Han</p>
<p>"(Mystery)" is a title given to the Chinese by Westerners. Probably they think that the Chinese national character and the things that Chinese people do are mostly different from theirs, or beyond reason and common sense, so their observations of the Chinese are also inexplicable, and this title of "(mystery)" has become good material for Westerners to laugh at.</p>
<p>Indeed, Chinese affairs are somewhat elusive. For example: it was originally spiritual unity to jointly face national disasters, but we ourselves put on a full martial arts performance. On the front line, blood and flesh fly everywhere, but in the rear, we have dancing to save the country. Today we send telegrams to kill the enemy, but tomorrow we quietly slip away. The more loudly we speak, the more tricks there are, and the more bizarre and colorful it is, so much so that we ourselves cannot help but feel comical. Even Westerners, when they see it, may shout: "This child is the most slippery of them all, my eyes are blurred!"</p>
<p>However, the Japanese are smart after all, and they guessed that the secret to solving the mystery is artillery, so the "(mystery)" that has been misunderstood for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Cheap Price, the Buyers Are Always Thinking Like This <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>The veil on his face was torn off with a loud bang on "(September 18th)," and oh! "(Mystery)" turned out to be just that.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese are ultimately difficult to understand. The old mystery has already been exposed, but a new silent gourd has been born. At present, the deep meaning of this silent gourd is profound and far-reaching, and the little ones are ignorant and dare not speculate rashly, but the Westerners may only know one or two, and the mystery of the matter lies in what medicine is hidden, and outsiders should not easily peek into the secret. However, according to routine calculations, there may not be another brilliant trick, and when the signboard is uncovered, I am afraid it is just a dark mass.</p>
<p>Recently, the mysterious gourd seems to be faintly releasing some faint sounds, as if saying: "It is difficult for eastern Hebei to fall, which does not hinder the overall situation, and besides, victory or defeat is a common thing for military strategists. Accepting adversity calmly, it is better to hold on to tranquility. Although it has not been welcomed by the enemy, the style of yielding and giving way by the elders has long been promoted throughout the world."</p>
<p>Then, it further warned: "When the Di people invaded Bin, King Tai moved to Qi. Being strong but not resisting is an ancient teaching. They use strength, we use gentleness; they use movement, we use stillness; sit and wait for ten years, the three islands will have earthquakes, and there will be a revolution in Tokyo. When luck comes, who will the final victory belong to but us!"</p>
<p>The author heard this and couldn't help but jump for joy three hundred times and shout wildly, "Long live the birth of the new silent gourd!"</p>

<p>Editor Sir;</p>
<p>Every time I see you explain the doubts of the clerks in your newspaper, I can't help but feel the depression that has accumulated in my heart for several months surge to my head; so I venture to ask for your guidance:</p>
<p>I am a small employee in a company in this port, and my monthly income is still considerable. Five years ago (at the age of sixteen), with the idea of ​​my family and with my own consent, I got engaged to Miss Chen. Chen has also met me several times; both sides' temperament and family circumstances are quite suitable. Unexpectedly, in the year of the engagement, because I was bullied by my stepmother at home and was too busy at school, I developed scrofula. I am now twenty-one years old, and in these five years of living with the disease, although I have been treated by doctors in various ports, it has not been effective after all. Last spring, because of her age, the other party repeatedly asked to get married. For the sake of my remaining body, I declined several times. This spring, I felt comforted by all parties, so I made a firm decision and went to a certain hospital on Baker Road in this port for surgery. Although I have undergone two operations, according to the doctor's diagnosis, it is difficult to recover in a short time, and I definitely need to rest and recuperate. For the sake of my health, of course, I cannot get married in the near future; but if the other party continues to ask, then what method can I use to satisfy the other party? It really makes it difficult for me to the utmost. With twelve thousand points of sincerity, I hope that you can give me a satisfactory solution in a short period of time, that would be truly grateful. Sincerely wish you</p>
<h3 id="e293">Health, Gu Yousan respectfully <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's note: Gu Jun's illness, as the doctor has determined, is difficult to recover in a short time, so it is of course advisable not to get married. Because the result of marriage is not only extremely dangerous for your health, but also harmful and unprofitable for Miss Chen. You feel that when they come to ask for marriage, there is no way to refuse; this is entirely because your concept is wrong. You only know that not getting married is "(for the sake of protecting health)," so you feel that it is inevitable to be selfish and inconvenient to speak. You should know that the reason for not getting married is mostly for the sake of taking care of the other party, then you will be justified. If they really insist on meeting and must get married, you only have the method of rather terminating the engagement. A matter of life and death does not allow submission.</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Inside, there were about sixteen or seventeen tables. As usual, the tables were piled with writing brushes, ink, paper, and the like, but there wasn't a single person in sight. All the people were crowded tightly together in one corner like ants. Several were laughing and gesticulating, several were counting money, and several were discussing with avid interest. Everyone was focused intently on something in the middle. No one noticed that Wu Yi had arrived from behind. Wu Yi also didn't want to disturb them, so with his hands behind his back, he quietly walked over and mingled into their group.</p>
<p>In the middle of the crowd was an ordinary office table, but there were no writing materials on the table. There was only a piece of white paper spread out, and on the paper, the Arabic numerals one, two, three, and four were written in large red ink, as well as the numbers (one three) and (two four), each a bit smaller. On each of these numbers, there was a considerable amount of money – coins, silver dollars, and banknotes were all present. At the head of the table sat a clerk with a serious demeanor. In front of him, besides a large pile of banknotes and silver, there was also an overturned porcelain jar. This person's hands were firmly pressed on the jar.</p>
<p>"Is everything ready?"</p>
<p>"Ready! Open!" The people around simultaneously urged him with a sense of fatalism. The person then let go of his hands and lifted the overturned porcelain jar. This reveal was no small matter. It immediately made everyone around shrink three inches. Each person bent over, eagerly stretching out their necks to look at what was on the table. Wu Yi also busily squeezed into a gap and peered intently.</p>
<p>What was under the jar turned out to be a pile of enamel badges, about the size of two dimes, of the "(National Universities Professors' Anti-Japanese National Salvation Association)." There were approximately twenty or thirty of them. The person sitting in the center then divided them into groups of four, distributing them one group at a time. After the division, of course, there was a remainder.</p>
<p>"One! Haha! Picking the heavy with the light!" This time, the remainder was one. So the person in the center grabbed a lot of money and laughed contentedly. Many of the kind folks who had placed money on the numbers (two), (three), or (four) hung their heads dejectedly, muttering all sorts of vulgar curses.</p>
<p>"Haha! Old Huang! Three dollars in the bag!" One fellow, who had probably bet on the number (one) and profited from it, was so excited that he forgot himself for a moment. Turning around, without looking carefully, he reached out and grabbed Wu Yi's shoulder, shaking him vigorously and laughing.</p>
<p>"Friend! Excuse me! May I say a few words?" Wu Yi raised his voice and said these three sentences, immediately waking up the group of National Salvation Association staff members who were wildly gambling. The gentleman who had grabbed him, needless to say, had long since let go. Wu Yi's face, however, was without any sign of anger, just smiling. "My name is Wu Yi. I happen to be one of the executive committee members of this association! But I've never been here before. I didn't know that you all often relax here. Now that I know, I can't do anything about it. However, I have one request. I hope you will convey it to Executive Committee Member Doctor Li. Please ask him, for my sake, to take down that horizontal plaque above the door starting today!"</p>
<p>Wu Yi's sudden appearance and his sharp, cold words truly made this group of reveling gentlemen feel quite uneasy. No one knew how to deal with it.</p>
<p>"Goodbye! I wish you happiness!" The old doctor, filled with disappointment, walked away with small steps.</p>

<h3 id="e295">Interesting Anecdotes from the London Screening of "Moonlight Serenade on the Spring River" <a href="#e295" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c295" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">295</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Fu</p>
<p>One Hundred Prospective Brides Attend the Theater</p>
<p>On the evening of the London screening of "Tell Me Tonight," jointly produced by Gaumont and British International Pictures, one hundred prospective brides suddenly arrived one after another. Their prospective grooms were none other than Jan Kiepura, the male lead in the film, who is a very famous Polish singer. As it turned out, Jan Kiepura was held up by other matters and could not attend, so a new date was set. How did this mysterious event come about? Listen to the explanation next time.</p>
<p>It started when Jan Kiepura was filming this movie. A reporter went to the studio to interview him. He inadvertently let slip that he would very much like to find an English woman to marry. Unexpectedly, the reporter published his words in the newspaper. Imagine, with his reputation and charm, plus an annual income of thirty-five thousand pounds, how could he not be admired and envied by European girls? As a result, letters of application flooded in, totaling more than seventeen thousand. Among them were English girls, Scottish ladies, and Irish misses; and most of the letters included beautiful photographs of the applicants. Jan Kiepura was now richer than if he had opened a large photography studio.</p>
<p>Later, when the film was finished, and ready for a screening at a theater in London. Jan Kiepura happened to be performing elsewhere, but he still carried the seventeen thousand letters with him. He selected one hundred letters from the many. He copied the names and addresses of these one hundred ladies and sent them to his London representative, telling him that he must invite these one hundred ladies to attend the screening of "Moonlight Serenade on the Spring River," and that he also planned to come to London to meet them after the film.</p>
<p>However, Jan Kiepura did not give the details of this matter in his letter, so at the time, neither the film company nor his representative could guess why he wanted to invite so many female guests. But since he had sent a letter, they had to follow his instructions in a confused state. On the day of the screening, all the invited female guests did arrive. Unexpectedly, Jan Kiepura did not have time to come, so these one hundred ladies, after the film, not being greeted by anyone, had to leave in disappointment. Later, Jan Kiepura told people the story, and everyone understood. But according to himself, this action was not entirely a joke. He really wanted to find an ideal bride among these one hundred ladies!</p>

<h3 id="e296">A Review of "Dangerously Yours" <a href="#e296" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c296" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">296</a></h3>
<p>— Lei</p>
<p>The story is as follows: A well-dressed jewel thief steals jewelry from an old widow. At the time, only a young girl knows his secret, but because she loves the thief, she runs away with him. Later, although she strongly urges him to hand over the stolen goods, she is imprisoned by the thief. One day, she seizes an opportunity to escape into the sea. From then on, the thief, touched by the girl's virtue, has a change of heart, returns all the jewelry to its original owner, and eventually lives happily ever after with the girl.</p>
<p>A story like this is, of course, meaningless. But only American film professionals would be willing to spend so much money and energy on it. In this situation, we can see how far American cinema has fallen.</p>
<p>Speaking of the director, he naturally cannot create a great work from a mediocre script. But even so, in terms of the performance, he can't even clearly tell us the story. This must be said to be the director's immaturity. The entire film uniformly lacks a clear system, and it pays no attention to acting but focuses on unnecessary dialogue. However, the use of the camera is not so bad. Several exterior shots of the sea are also very good. Also, the way the girl's two cries for help on the boat are covered up in different ways is a clever point of the director and a highlight of the play. Like the scene of the spiritualist performing magic, is also very good.</p>
<p>As for the performances, they are extremely mediocre. The male lead is so lazy and unenthusiastic, and the female lead uses a middle-aged woman to play a young girl, which is unpleasant. There are no brilliant performances among the supporting roles. Only the unimportant female character who throws the cards has a bit of special charm. As for that clown, we seem to have seen him in "The Merry Widow", but his few expressions here, although not so stiff, cannot make people laugh. So the play's few "gags" are also ineffective.</p>
<p>Other aspects: The light’s spatial and temporal distinctions are very realistic. Especially the two scenes of the spiritualist performing magic, are very beautiful. The sets are mediocre and lack distinctive loopholes. The sound recording is pure enough to pass. But even with these achievements, it still can't bring the play up to standard, can it?</p>
<p>The Yueming Film Company is famous for producing martial arts films. Recently, it has changed its style. The image on the right is a scene from the company director Ren Pengnian’s new work "Blood Letter", starring Little Star Xiao Wulizhu, who is Ren’s beloved daughter. It is said that this film will be released at the Central Grand Theater soon.</p>
<h3 id="e297">The Famous Film "Desire" Premieres Tonight (Thursday) <a href="#e297" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c297" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">297</a></h3>
<p>— Niao</p>
<p>丨At the Paris Grand Theater丨</p>
<p>The latest production from the French Gaumont Film Company, "Desire"</p>
<p>Princess Tarakanova is an unprecedented historical masterpiece, depicting the licentiousness of the Russian Empress Catherine II during her reign, the greed of the Gypsy girl, and the aloofness of Princess Tarakanova, all of which are deeply moving. The female lead, Edith Jehanne, is most skilled in inner performance. In the play, she plays two characters with different personalities (namely, the Gypsy girl and Tarakanova), and both of them match the identities of the characters in the play. The costumes and sets throughout the film are rich and magnificent, and the harmony and melodiousness of the music are unique since European films began. It was created under the guidance of French master musicians, combining the strengths of Germany and Russia. Anyone with a special fondness for music will definitely feel its greatness. The film will premiere at the Paris Theater starting tonight at 9:30.</p>
<h3 id="e298">American Highway Film <a href="#e298" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c298" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">298</a></h3>
<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>Recently screened at the American Club, with many Chinese and Westerners attending</p>
<p>The American Chamber of Commerce screened an American highway sound film at the Citibank Club on Monday evening. Leaders from Chinese and foreign political, business, and academic circles were invited to attend, making it a grand occasion. Before the highway film was screened, American Chamber of Commerce President Frank Hsu and American Commercial Counselor Arnold gave brief welcome and introduction speeches. The most essential sentence was that highway development occupies a very important position in modern Chinese transportation. The United States builds highways to facilitate transportation and also hopes to help other countries do such construction. After the speeches, the highway film was screened. The film showed us the completion of the American highway plan in 1930, with representatives from fifty-one countries being invited to visit. Representatives from various countries set off from Washington, D.C., traveling by long-distance bus, and were shown each section with subtitles explaining it. American highways total three million miles. Some are funded by the federal government, some are funded by state governments, and some are built by local governments. From the Canadian border in the north to the southernmost Mexican border, from the Atlantic coast in the east to the South Pacific coast, they run horizontally and vertically through states, cities, and villages. People with cars can drive wherever they want, going anywhere they please. Americans are so happy! The film shows us the progress from the slow manual road construction of the past to the rapid machine road construction of the present, as well as the construction of concrete hard-surfaced main roads and convenient branch roads, layer by layer. In some places, there is a railway above and a highway below, or a highway above and a railway below, intersecting in a cross shape. Finally, the film shows the highway network of each state in a statistical form, which is densely layered like a net. After watching it, one can't help but be envious and think that if the money that has been sent abroad to buy military supplies to fuel internal strife in China for more than twenty years could be used to build roads or build other public welfare projects, it would be quite impressive.</p>

<p>Hu Die, who was selected as the 1933 Chinese Film Queen, has two more works coming out after starring in "Raging Tides." One is the sound film "Powder Market" directed by Zhang Shichuan, and the other is "Spring River Love Wave" directed by the old master Zheng Zhengqiu. The currently filming "Manjianghong" (directed by Cheng Bugao) is also starring her.</p>
<p>Chen Kenran and Xu Qin Fang, a couple who recently joined the Star Film Company, and the old woman Xuan Jinglin, have all completed their first films: The Chen couple collaborated on "The Road to Fitness," and Xuan Jinglin starred in "Future."</p>
<p>Ai Xia's "A Modern Woman," in which she broke the film industry record (as a screenwriter and star), and Hu Ping's "Sister's Way Out," have both begun filming; the former is more than halfway through production.</p>
<p>Recently, Star Film Company produced a mixed film of music and scenery: On one hand, it recorded various beautiful national music from the Datong Music Society, such as the pipa, erhu, and sanxian; on the other hand, it filmed famous mountains and scenic spots that fit the mood of the music, such as High Mountain Flowing Water and Moonlight Serenade on the Spring River. This can be said to be a rather poetic creation.</p>

<p>— Ne</p>
<p>Joe had gone through several wars and fortunately had not encountered any accidents. From 1914, 1915, until 1918, in these dark years, he still returned to London from time to time to find his lover, Fanny, and live their life of love. That day was an evening in 1918. Joe and Fanny had dinner together and returned to Fanny's dressing room. Joe was about to leave for the front again. They were reluctant to part. Fanny gave Joe a gold locket with a small portrait of herself inside, instructing him to keep it close to him. Joe instructed her to write to him every day. Outside the dressing room, music was playing. The curtain on the stage was rising and falling, one play after another. Fanny's dressing room door had been knocked several times, urging her to go out. At the last minute, Fanny was still reluctantly saying sweet words to Joe. Outside, they were shouting, "Miss Bridges, hurry up!" So she had to go out. At the moment of parting, Joe carefully looked at Fanny's face. Her smile, her courage, her tears, her inner pain, had all been deeply imprinted in his heart, until his death. But in another month or two, everything would be over!</p>
<p>On this day, Armistice Day in 1918, Keien's maid returned and said, "Mrs. Bridges is here to visit." Keien suspiciously invited her in. Ellen was very proud, wearing Parisian fashion, holding opera glasses in her hand, and was imperious, not at all like a servant to her former mistress. Keien reached out and said, "Ellen, I never dreamed it was you." Ellen did not shake her hand. She said, "I have a very important matter to discuss with you." Keien said, "That's great, I've been wanting to see you. Please sit down and tell me everything, how is Fanny?" Ellen said angrily: "I came for her, for her and Joe"! Keien asked in surprise, "Joe?" Ellen said: Yes. They:::I don't have to hide it, they already have a relationship. I think::: (What do you think)? Keien's happiness born from the armistice had all disappeared. Ellen said: "Now that the war has stopped, Joe will be back soon, I think they should get married." Keien asked Ellen if Fanny knew she was coming. Ellen shook her head. Keien felt relieved. Fortunately, Fanny was not that kind of gold digger, otherwise Joe would have a relationship with this kind of woman and would not know how to love herself. She said to Ellen: "This matter can only be discussed when Joe comes back. I never interfere in my son's affairs. You should have discussed it with Fanny before you came. This question can only be discussed later. Goodbye, Ellen."</p>
<p>Ellen heard this and had to slowly retreat towards the door of the guest room. But she suddenly turned around again and said to Keien in anger: "Don't think that Fanny is not worthy of marrying your son? If you think that way, you are wrong! Fanny is popular everywhere, and all the people she associates with are first-class figures. Moreover, it is not like before, everything has changed. However, some people move forward with the times, and some people are willing to fall behind." (To be continued)</p>
