<p>時評</p>
<h3>助國人認識東北問題之一席談話</h3>
<p>— 梓</p>
<p>日來東京方面。又以中日局勢轉變之消息向外散放矣在此有作用的新聞傳播中。日外相廣田。更利用通訊社。非正式發表所謂打開僵局三要點吾人讀其［勸中國認識中日兩國根本的利害一致之事實］［勸中國認識於中國政治的經濟的有益之事實］兩語。覺其所挾誘惑力量足以迷惑國内一部人對於東北問題之認識。正思有以關其謬。適有何君來自遼東向本館報告最近東北實况。何君曾留學法國。歸國後參加鄧鐵梅義勇軍此次雖失敗南來。其所談却甚質實。有異於一般宣傳氣分過於濃厚之談話殊有助於國人對於東北問題之認識也兹録載重要問答數段於次。。</p>
<p>記者問　東北義勇軍最近實况如何。</p>
<p>何君答　自關内抗日活動銷沉後義勇軍旣無法活動又斷絶接濟無以維持。各部紛紛散伏。甚有用不得已方法以求食者。日人對僅有之有組織義勇軍。必以兵力攻除對其散伏求食則極端放任。迫使義勇軍全部匪化與住民不兩立。現除吉林民氣沉着之一部分地方外。義勇軍少有整部存在者。</p>
<p>記者問　日人控制東北之手段如何。</p>
<p>何君答　日人目前控制東北之進行。其最狠辣之手段爲人心之控制現在各中小學校。每週必授日語十餘小時。每校皆以一日本敎員任監督訓育。自小學校起。所讀歷史。皆自滿清入主中國開始。即所謂滿洲歷史也循是以往。數年以後。不難使東北人民完全忘却其故國。加以數萬之鮮民以［老亡國民］之資格壓迫人民。更使東北人不敢提起中國最近東北人民有一種特殊心理。見自關内往者。必加以秘密歡迎藉以探問政府有無拯救彼等之消息。甚有見日飛機之翺翔誤認爲中國空軍出征關外者將來此種心理因失望而銷滅以後。日人對東北人民之心理控制即可告成功何君並言　華北停戰後日吏對自内地赴東北者。認定其已無從活動檢察不如從前之嚴。只須於日吏詢問國籍時答以［滿洲國人民。］日吏必照例報以［好好國民。······中國人眞壞想擾亂滿洲國］等語後握手慰勞以收其心。</p>
<p>記者問　日本移民東北之成績如何。</p>
<p>何君答　日本移民現尙只是第一步。在東北八十餘萬日本人多集居城市。瀋陽長春哈爾濱等地。雖滿街木屐兒。鄉間則絶少日人對鄉村則威脅利誘以大量移殖鮮民。此類鮮民。有强種當地人民墾熟稻田之權利人民如拒絶强佔。日軍必以武力相壓迫。</p>
<p>綜核上載問答之詞。可以得到一根本認識。即中日問現狀之持續。已授日本以從容進行其統治方策之機會。若再退一步則東北反日之人心必全銷滅。反日之勢力。必被剷除將。來即有恢復失土之時機亦不能利用去年此時。松岡洋右正大言將於國聯大會作六十年來滿洲問題之總結算。今則此總結算之舉。乃轉移中日外交壇坫上矣。吾并揭兩義。以報廣田。</p>
<p>（一）中國人認識在東北失地未復以前。中日兩國根本的利害實相衝突。</p>
<p>（二）中國人認識東北爲中國領土。東北不收復。則所受政治的經濟的損害。均太重大。</p>

<h3>石井談話　避免美日戰爭</h3>
<p>（東京）今日上午九時歸抵東京車站之石井全權、對前往歡迎之記者、談話如下、經濟會議决裂當時、一時似甚興奮、但不能謂今難立即召開此種會議、且多數有各國必須恊調之空氣、至於會議停止後之對日狀態、曾有諸說、惟此際日美兩國之衝突事、實應忌避者也若日美發生戰事、其結果或將發生世界大戰之慘事、故由此點觀之、如日美仲裁裁判條約等、依余個人之私意、固甚佳事、又歡洲對日之空氣大槪良好、至於英國等、於經濟的雖抱不平、而於大局則因有舊日之友誼關係、如滿洲問題、在始雖　有和平主義者之非難、但最近殆已逐漸諒解日本之立塲、至於法國、因對日抱有好感、故如所傳之對滿投資、僅係一部份資本家之策畫、毫無政治的意味也、又德意同盟、現尚未成事實、</p>
<h3>深井談話提倡經濟聯絡</h3>
<p>又深井全權之談話如下美國於經濟會議、最初似欲議决大綱、後因會議時情形變化、乃悵然、且各國全權均顧及各本國之立塲、而有所主張、經濟會議因此失敗、如是則若一意主張本國之利益、無論第二次或第三次、均無開會可能、况今後各國間之問題、無由國際的解决之希望、而不能不由特殊國、經特殊的討論、於當事國間解决之也、即各國均行獨特的統制經濟、而於日本亦應鞏固統制經濟、謀與特殊的關係國、爲經濟的聯絡、向共存共榮之目標進行也云、（六日電通電）</p>

<h3>英美戰債重開議　範圍擴大等於經濟會議　兩國復興進展不加阻碍</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）英美戰債問題、業於今晨在美財政部開始談判、由英代表李斯羅士與美財次阿哲森及其他代表專家等、談話三十分鐘、未定下次會議期而散、聞英代表於散會後、立即電達本國政府、料似商榷今後談話之趨向、又聞雙方代表曾研究美國金融狀况、略事討論國際貿易情况、世界主要金融國家問黄金流動情形、及有關英國還債之其他經濟事件、英代表未曾提出修改戰債特别計劃、僅提議先行研究、足以影響英國還債能力之一切事件、及美國一般金融狀况、外間多謂雙方代表今日第一次會議、即研究貨幣事件與黄金流動、足覘此番債務會議勢將漸變爲貨幣談判、兩日前美政府某要人曾預料英美談話、將辦理日後在倫敦開貨幣會議之基礎工作、觀於今日會議情形而益信、今晨偕英代表李斯羅士出席者、有英大使林德賽與英財政專家皮胡萊、觀於散會前未定下屆會期一層、足見此次談判、將徐徐進行、俾英代表可常與本國政府交換意見云、（五日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）　現此間對於戰債問題之注意、已超過一切重要問題之上、頃聞美政府關於戰債談判、曾向此間著名銀行家徵詢意見、而今日會議情形、似英代表李斯羅士·英大使林德賽·與美財次阿哲森、皆不欲亟亟於討論修改提議、而願先行研究足以影響戰債之經濟狀况、此種態度、亦爲此間大多數銀行家贊同、據垣街所接私家電訊、李斯羅士與阿哲森俱同意、對於兩國目下在復興方面所有之進展、不當加以阻碍、故此次談話、較之歷屆戰債談話、最饒有兼顧雙方之空氣、現財部雖未有表示、足以徵實漸將趨向穩定貨幣之消息、而紐約銀行家、皆信穩定貨幣、將爲其結果之一、蓋若輩仍認安定金元與金鎊匯價、大足以鼓勵國際貿易、而使工商各業發生信任心云、（五日國民電）</p>
<h3>軍縮問題德國提出答案　墨索里尼另擬新計劃</h3>

<p>羅馬　意首相墨索里尼爲調和各方面意見、及挽救軍縮會議於危殆起見、特草就一種軍縮新計畫、此消息現已由墨氏自草之論文、在今日之意大利民報公布、該文首先陳述軍縮會議當前之困難、以及國聯威信因日本之行爲所受之損失後、墨氏即稱、現在尚未到毁無藥之時期、但須設法袪除相互間之不信任及誤會而已、墨氏繼謂、所謂［和約之保護人、］及直接受和約影響之諸國、雙方感情之不良、確爲無庸諱言之事實、但戰敗國之不滿、確亦有理由存在、蓋彼等爲和約所束縛而解除軍備、而戰勝國則不受和約之限制、不顧其同等减軍之信誓、至今尚未完成其義務也、再則、現在德國已獲有同等地位之待過、而四强公約亦已成立、故今後欲繼續對於德國加以歧視、實屬萬難、但在他一方面、則其他國家之特殊複雜情形、亦不能不加以考慮云、該文之結論、爲欲克服上述之種種困難、墨氏已草就一新軍縮草約、預備數日之内、即可向各國提出云、（五日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）　昨日保守黨常年大會、通過邱吉爾之動議案、主張政府應增加英帝國國防、本日保守黨機關報［晨報］、評論此事、力陳英國陸海軍實力與其他强國比較、已相形見絀、凡縮减軍備之企圖、實屬喪心病狂、此皆由於社會主義者與國際主義者影響及於内閣、乃有此不幸之事實云、結論則謂一九一四年之大戰、法比兩國難領士被人佔領、但英國所受痛苦、亦不遜於法比、故英國縮减軍備之謬論、在社會主義之政綱中不能容忍、在國民内閣中、更無立足之可能、最近歐洲之事變、足以顯示英國久已鑄成大錯、此層當使政府及國人力戒前非、實爲保守黨所負之歷史使命云、（六日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日每日郵報力主英國當擴張空軍、俾在世界和平中復可佔仲裁人之地位、該報故反對日内瓦縮減空軍之建議、謂英國商用飛機之數、今已降至第四位、美國逾萬架、法國有一千八百二十一架、德國有一千二百架、而蘇俄尙未計入、蘇俄有商用飛機八千至一萬之間、且每月添造百架云、（五日國民電）</p>

<p>哈伐那　據可靠方面消息、參謀部長巴底斯達上校與大學生一派、發生裂痕、此外巴底斯達上校、以已與美國大使威爾斯會晤數次、據此間解釋、由此種事實、可見古巴政府不久將與美國妥恊、而各黨集中内閣之組織、亦頗有進展、惟大學生始終反對集中内閣耳、古巴政府以爲國家主義派雖反對組織集中内閣、但如能邀其代表參加組閣、或可消除障礙云、（五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>宋子文談話　關稅庫劵歸還舊欠　棉業統制會陳光甫任主席　全國經濟會在滬設辦事處</h3>
<p>財政部長宋子文、前晨偕國聯專員拉西曼返滬後、昨晨十時、在西愛咸斯路財部辦事處、接見各報社記者、對外傳一萬萬元新關稅庫劵、先行向銀行界抵借五千萬元一節、力加否認、兹將宋氏談話、分誌於次、</p>
<h3>庫劵抵借不確</h3>
<p>宋氏首謂、外傳財政部此次發行之關稅庫劵一萬萬元、先行向本市銀行界抵借五千萬元之說、并非事實、蓋以此次庫劵、完全用以償還積欠、事前經接洽妥當、過去之五六個月來、財部向銀行界挪借、已達六各餘萬、此種借欵、大都是臨時性質、此時須先行還清此項借欠、</p>
<h3>收支力求平衡</h3>
<p>中央財政刻雖極度拮据、但吾人正在設法謀打破此難關、其第一問題、務使收支適合、對於軍費方面、如華北已由七百餘萬、减至四百五十餘萬、嗣後中央軍費亦須縮減、惟目下中央各軍、正在努力剿匪、在事實上言、此點尚未可能、</p>
<p>棉業會即成立</p>
<p>全國經濟委員會中之棉業統制委員會、刻已籌備就緒、日内即可成立、委員人選約十餘人、兹已聘定陳光甫·唐星海·李升伯·鄒秉文·謝祺等五人、陳爲主任、其餘委員人選、尙在物色中、將來一切經費、當由政府盡最撥給、</p>
<h3>各會按步組織</h3>
<p>其他如絲業·礦業·食糧·等各委員會之組織、自亦不容稍緩、當按步進行、惟政府方面、對於各該會主持人選、擬多聘各該業經騐豐富之人物擔任、而政府則從旁輔助、作一種後盾、但政府對一切用人、則主特别愼重、以免爲人操縱、</p>
<h3>在滬設辦事處</h3>
<p>全國經濟委員會爲求辦事上之便利起見、决在滬設立一辦事處、刻正找尋房屋、一俟擇定、即可成立、全國經濟委員會之工程處、决改爲水利處、即將遷往南京、至於美棉美麥之推銷、則仍歸中央銀行附設之貨購美棉麥辦事處主持、拉西曼爲國聯特派之中國技術合作聯絡員、屬於全國經濟委員會之下、監督國聯特派來華之技術人員、繼拉西曼氏而來華者、尚有技術人員多人、將來須視需要何種技術人員、再行通知國聯派遣、拉西曼氏個人、則無設置辦事處之必要也、</p>
<h3>關稅互惠未詳</h3>
<p>記者旋以日電傳稱日方欲以關稅互惠爲條件、取銷在華領事裁判權事、叩諸宋氏、　答、本人亦僅見諸報載、不知其詳、恐不過談談而已、或係彼方之宣傳作用、亦未可知云、</p>

<h3>麵粉業公會昨議救濟辦法　麵粉交易所昨起停拍</h3>
<p>本市麵粉廠同業公會、因鑒於國内麵粉業日漸衰落、最近更不景氣有全滬麵粉廠停車之勢、特於昨日下午五時、在銀行俱樂部公開會議、到會廠家代表、計有福新·阜豐·華豐·信大祥·新中華·申大·等廠十餘人、推顧韾一爲主席、即由主席致報告詞云、我麵粉廠同業、近年來營業衰頽、達於極點、故召集會議、討論救濟方針、次由各廠代表、分述麵粉滯銷粉價日賤、每包售價、不敷成本、尤其下色粉毫無銷路、自從東北失陷、麵粉大宗銷售之地失去、我麵粉廠業即受一大打擊、而天津市揚、洋粉充斥、最近仍有洋粉成交、蓋我國政府、雖已加征進口稅每包一角餘、惜嫌太輕、目下外國匯票鬆跌、此區區一角餘之稅洋、不值其傾銷之一顧、故北洋帮（即天津帮）之銷售、無法恢復、而南洋帮如福州·厦門·等又爲兵匪所擾、客商不敢購運、交易所多頭無人問津、致市面愈趨愈下、故不得已陸續停工、爲消極之救濟、旋即决議六種辦法、（一）洋粉進口關稅、應請再加征一元至五角、因日本之洋粉進口稅約洋一元、小呂宋之進口稅約洋五角也、（二）請在棉麥借欵中撥借一千萬元、輕利出貸、分期償還、（三）請全國經濟委員會從速組織糧食統制委員會、（四）對於内地小規模之機製麵粉業應與廠家同樣徵收統稅、（五）減收麵粉運輸費用、（六）全國軍需請儘各廠麵粉購辦、以減少積滯、</p>
<p>又本市麵粉交易所、昨起忽然停拍、因日來麵粉業之衰頽、日甚一日、麵粉大跌、因而空頭須追加保證金、追加之欵、須達三十餘萬、而已加者祇有十餘萬、尚有大半之數未加、不得已停拍、今日如果保證金再不繳足、將再行停拍、</p>

<h3>電力工潮昨訊　市商會昨發宣言</h3>
<p>上海電力公司工潮、各部工人仍繼續怠工、並有離廠者、新聲社記者昨特分往各處調查、並承電力公司副總裁兼總理薛爾德發表談話、兹分誌如下、</p>
<h3>爲養老金</h3>
<p>薛爾德語新聲社記者云、上海電力公司洞庭路新廠工人、因反對公司開除工人三名、於上月二十九日晨怠工後、復於本月二日、聯合斐倫路老廠工人、同時離廠罷工、前日又牽動新廠臨時工及老廠頭目加入罷工、因公司不允給付養老金、故新老兩廠罷工工人、一千四百名、昨日仍繼續罷工、餘如寫字間及新老廠職員發電工人一千一百人、仍照常安心工作、</p>
<h3>照合同辦</h3>
<p>又稱、此次開除之三工人、内有二人平日品行不端、一人則有過、而又自動辭職、依照公司與工部局所訂之合同、不能照給、况公司並無過失、故未能以工人額外之需索、而違背固有之規定、查此次兩廠工人之罷工、實係受人煽惑、勞方所傳公司派捕拒工進出、純屬謬說、</p>
<h3>不良誘惑</h3>
<p>又據稍、電力公司平日對待工會、甚爲優厚、因不良份子之煽惑罷工、致不少良好工人、受其威嚇而不能工作、此公司所引爲遺憾者、内有不少良好工人、在廠工作、因恐罷工工人之滋擾、故要求公司請捕保護、並住食於廠、蓋恐罷工工人之作難也、依此可知工人意旨未趨一致、</p>
<h3>發電無碍</h3>
<p>記者又詢以發電工人及職員、將加入罷工、公司將作何處置、據答、並未前聞、然公司爲公共事業、爲社會服務計、如果至此地步、則决另雇工人替代、况滬埠如電機廠麵粉廠等、全恃持電力工作、公司爲業務上利便起見、爲各界之需要、縱使三班工等全體罷工、亦决招雇工人、使電力流通、故發電不生問題、至於罷工工人如欲進廠工作、公司决仍准其繼續服務、其已復職之剪線工人、實係工人自動來廠工作者、</p>
<h3>頭目會議</h3>
<p>本市社會局對於此案、甚爲重視、曾會同市黨部派員一再調停無效、誠恐事態再行擴大、昨已專文呈市府請示核辦、俾糾紛早日解决、又四區水電工會以工人離廠多日、尚未能解决、定八日下午三時開頭目會議、討論應付辦法</p>
<h3>商會宣言</h3>
<p>市商會爲上海電力公司解僱工友、資方不遵官廳法令調解、形勢擴大、有妨公用事業、該會以公正之立塲、特發宣言去、上海電力公司、前因解雇工友倪根富等、以及發給養老金問題、迭經發生爭執、曾由黨部及工部局華董數次調解、均無成議、乃突於九月二十七日、公司方面又將薛阿寳·戴仁恒·印炳根·等三人、予以解雇、且未照給養老金、遂致新廠方面全部工人、於二十九日宣告怠工、嗣以廠方拒絶工友要求、迫令離職工人一律解雇、因之老廠工人羣起援助、形勢益復擴大、本會以爲勞資糾紛、依法本有解决塗徑、乃公司因其國籍關係、拒却官廳之合法調解、以致日久相持、對於公用事業之立場、以及勞資恊調之重要、似均未曾顧及、不能不引爲遺憾、用特發表宜言如左、冀喚起該公司之注意、</p>
<h3>公司通告</h3>
<p>公司昨發告工友云、近日在本埠報上、發現許多不正確之言論、本公司乃不得不將事實詳爲縷述、以免被虛謬說詞所誘誤、（一）工人養老金前在工部局時代所發百分之五者、兹已減爲百分之一或二矣、更有進者、此項減低之養老金、公司可任意取消之、蓋對於解職工人、可詭言工人因過失而被歇、養老金公司卽可拒絶發給、上述正確事實如下、當本公司未脫離工部局之時、對工作已滿二十年之職工、不論因何緣故而去職者、皆給一種退職金、卽照其服務年數、以年俸百分之五推算、惟不滿二十年而去職者、例不得享此權利、蓋此係工資額外之獎金、其用意無非欲感動職工等、常同公司合作、所以此項辦法、本公司同意接受、而繼續施行、嗣公司曾會同工部局、將此次退職金章程修改、按公司辦法、凡職工服務在十五年以上者、無論因任何理由、離去工作、擬照年數、給予其年薪百分之五之退職金、此外職工服務在十五年以下、井非因本人過失被公司解僱、亦得按照其服務年限、比例給予該項退職金、除此規定以外、槪不給予退職金、查職工服務在十五年以下、因本人過失被公司解僱、或因服務不勤、或因工作時睡覺、或因逮章、擅離職守、致被公司開除者、卽不得享受此項退職金、此等職工、不論在工部局時代、或本公司時代、皆不能享受退職金、本公司對於上開定章、從未進背、此次工人薛阿寳於九月十三日請病假、其病狀曾經華藉醫生查視、因其可疑、故該醫生主張祗須給予病假兩日、至九月十五日、薛卽歸廠上工、并聲明其病症業已全愈矣、但十五日後、薛又離去、并不到廠上工、至九月廿五日晨、薛到楊樹浦廠牌子間聲稱、彼須告退、要求公司算給工資、但當工資發交彼具領時、薛因并無上述退職金一併支付、卽拒絶領取、職工戴仁恒、則擅離工作地點、卽將其開除、職工周炳根則於工作時間離去工作地點、而私自睡覺、乃將其開除、以上各事、顯然不能享受退職金、又此次罷工、公司事前未得預告、二人代表亦從未進見公司當局、（下略）</p>

<p>春秋</p>
<p>— 湧森</p>
<h3>黄禍</h3>
<p>— 虎頭</p>
<p>說起黄禍，简直要使人害怕！距今六百五十七年前，那時剛巧在宋朝寗宗帝時，蒙古族有個呌鐵木眞的，在斡難河上獨自稱帝，號成吉思汗，滅宋而有中國，改國號呌元，自稱世祖。那時候，建都燕京，便是現在的北平。他的疆城，東至日本海，南達安南，北及西伯利亞，西盡亞洲，西北跨歐洲。地界的寬廣，要算中國歷朝所未見。那時候歐洲人，看見黄色人的大中國民，害怕得什麽似的？所以稱中國人呌做黄禍！回想到想在，處處受强鄰的壓迫，弄得國土日蹙，國勢日弱，眞要不堪回首了！</p>
<p>與黄禍諧聲而現在一般人視同大禍的，便是［黄河］，黄河近正閙着何水汛瀾。據和平社調查··受災區面積共三四四三二方公里，被災區域至二十七處之多。京黎遍地，哭聲震天，大人先生東奔西走，忙着賑災堵口，報紙上也天天長篇累牘。這黄河水災之黄禍，简直比成吉思汗横跨亞歐兩洲的黄禍，還要厲害好幾倍哪！</p>
<p>其實［黄］字本來就有些可怕，鄉下博士測這個黄字，呌··一廿一畝田裡，種八把秧］。試想··廿一畝田，只種八把秧，這八把秧的量容，可也不小了。再看清制··凡領侍衞内大臣，護軍統領等官員，都得穿黄馬褂。遇皇上巡幸時，扈從坐着車子，前呼後擁，以壯觀瞻；此外文武大臣，或以大射中侯，或以行陣功烈，也都特賜黄馬褂。這黄馬褂又何等威風呢？</p>
<h3>吃</h3>
<p>— 邢廣益</p>
<p>學校裏辦事最感棘手的，不是敎法或課程怎樣的改進，乃是飯廳的風潮，鬧的無非是吃·</p>
<p>外國人對死人是獻花圈的，而中國的鬼是非吃不可的，有時死後的飯碗比活的更重要，所以有儒家［不孝有三，無後爲大］的倫理，爲的大槪是怕死後没有冷猪肉吃吧！不但鬼要吃，神也要吃，外國人對神是做禮拜的儀式的，也可以說是唯心論者，中國人對神是唯物的，這也許是主張馬克斯學說吧！</p>
<p>外國人的寒喧，總是問［早安］，［午安］，［晚安］，可是中國人的應酬，總是問··［吃了早飯没有］？［吃了中飯没有］？［吃了晚飯没有］？好像中國人一天到晚對吃飯是念念不忘的，其實飯碗問題的確比任何問題爲重要啊！</p>
<h3>漫話漫畫</h3>
<p>— 錢澐作文　棟良作畫</p>
<p>···可怕的兒童敎育···</p>
<p>我們與其把一般的文丐或畫匠說是無聯，毋寗直截痛快講明白他爲經濟，爲吃飯，被迫的寫那許無聯作品，神怪盡像，把中華無數小國民心靈迷惑了去；散學回家，亟亟的向街頭小書攤找那些租費一銅元一本的飛仙劍客，這種小册子每部常有八本至十餘本，一輩少知識的婦女也搶着消遺··害得他們夜裏夢到勝雲駕霧，日裏又將毛竹管吹射鷄毛箭，果然孩子有孩子的總敏，接着乾電筒一亮，自然··這當作大俠吐出的劍光了！</p>
<p>每個孩子正如一根嫩苗，要成大器，全持良好的敎育來灌注，如果孩子老是談着學着口吐飛劍，百里外隨意取人首級，這種深印怪象，家長們該怎樣的痛心你的孩子入迷至此；再從大處說··你願意見到中華的小國民都在吐劍？　假使偷賊無飯吃，我們是否夜中預先開着後門？</p>
<h3>羅曼斯之謎</h3>
<p>— 王慈</p>
<p>幾年來中國文壇上大衆文藝的呼聲，總可以說是很厲害的了；可是，呐喊儘你去呐喊，大衆們墊着梯子都夠不上，前三四年大衆們被［普羅列塔利亞］和［布爾喬亞］之謎纒得莫明其妙，前幾月大笔們被蕭伯納一來又對於［幽默］一詞起了懷疑··最近又流行着什麽［羅曼斯］，這種巧妙的詞句，眞使大衆們有［啼笑皆非］之感矣！</p>
<p>因爲要打破［羅曼斯］之謎，打開英漢大辭典，找到Ｒomance其詞，解曰··</p>
<p>（一）想像的小說，傳記，稗史，虛構的故事·（二）可視作小說之事蹟，才子佳人之事蹟，風流之事蹟，艶事，（三）虛構，荒誕，（四）妄想，痴情，小說心·········</p>
<p>我讀完了以後，替大衆們呼了一口冷氣，不禁有所感觸丨伏望日海外歸來之海内文豪，在著文的時候，少冩幾個［羅曼斯］，以及［波爾雪惟克］［羅曼諦克］等詞，使大衆們容易明白，則功德勝過背誦［阿彌陀佛］千萬遍矣丨即使萬一忍耐不住，即希多寫幾個［蜜絲］［蜜絲脫］，以及［非洋傘］［朋友ＡＢＣ］等，因此種詞句，大衆們墊着梯子尙能夠得上也！</p>
<h3>挨次序怡</h3>
<p>— 怡館主</p>
<p>挨次序，又可說是［守秩序］。如果要洋來洋去的話，也可說是［英奥特］（ＬnＯrder）。然而，我是中國人，吃的是中國飯，這篇寫的又是中國文，還是老老實實說聲［挨次序］，倒雅俗咸宜，婦孺皆知。</p>
<p>據說，不知是那一位說？［挨次序］，是黄髮碧眼的外國人，所最講究的。黑髮黑眼的中國人，是莫明其妙的。區區只爲是中國人，所以起先聽了這話，無名火高十丈，覺得未免太欺人了丨以爲黄髮碧眼的外國人，和黑髮黑眼的中國人，顔色上雖則不同，但是，［兩個肩膀扛個頭］，却没有兩樣，同是人類。爲什麽，外國人知道講究［挨次序］，而中國人却不知道講究［挨次序］呢？這些話，豈不是太看輕了我們中國人嗎？</p>
<p>然而，細想起來，惱什麽，事實擺在我們的面前，你瞧，一隻船剛攏了岸，船艙裏的乘客，便一窩蜂似的，都好像個個熟諳了［游泳術］，不怕失足跌下水去，什麽女人小孩是弱者，大家不知道。只知道爭先恐後，搶上了岸再說，眞是好看丨如果，是一部車子到來，那一陣擁上擠下的鳥亂，也是和船到一樣的熱鬧，交關有趣丨至於其它如車站，或是電影院裏，買票時的你搶我奪，大家都要爭一個先。於是氣力大的，後來居上。氣力小的，只好拿了角子鈔票，望着興歎丨唉！諸如此類，不知道講究［挨次序］的事實，的確，在我們中國，到處可以瞧見，是無可諱言的。</p>
<p>本來觀察一國的政治，是否上軌？社會的一切，是否健全？只要看他的國民，到處是否［挨次序］？就可得而知了。像我國的政治不上軌，社會一團糟，看在國民到處不知道講究［挨次序］，也許是這許多原因之一吧？</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十六回　　酸楚褾懷當前還祝福　倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍</p>
<p>殷得仁用手拍着他的肩膀道∶别那样傻想了。咱們接着命令，就只有趕快的照着命令行事，你坐在這裏發愁，那都是白找急，當連長總得當連長，開拔總得開拔，誤了事情不能辦，那還是悉上加悉，這又何苦呢。趙自强想了一想他的話却是不錯，只好打起精神來，告訴上士王士立趕快的造表册，當天就送到營部裏去。他私下依然找着殷得仁談話，揣度着不知還有幾天就要走。殷得仁道··你别視他們催表册催得那樣緊，那完全是一塲黑幕。有了這個表册，照着這個數目向司令部裏一報，給養費就下來了。遲一天開拔，咱們的頭兒，就從中多得一瓍的好處，爲什麽不多擱住幾天。所以你有什麽事的話，别忙，儘管從從容容去辦。五天以内，我想着還决不至於走。趙自强將兩隻手挿在褲袋謿，在屋子裏，連連的打了幾個轉身，自言自語的道··這件事，眞夠呌我爲難的，我還是馬上就告訴我們老爺子呢？還是到了臨走，才來告訴他呢？殷得仁笑道··有道是，清官難斷家務事，這一層我們就不能夠胡亂出主意了。照着這件事看起來，那豈不是我們做光桿兒的好嗎？趙自强聽了他的話，心裏是加上了一層混亂，更是來回的在屋子裏走了個不歇。這一天，心裏徘徊不定，也没有抽得及身回去。因爲營部裏在一日之間，却把造表册的事，催促了好幾回，没有法子，在當日下午，就把這表册趕造着，送將去了。到了次日上午團部却來了電話，召集營連長會議。趙自强一得了這個消息，更覺得這開拔的時期，一定就在目前。（二○八）</p>
<p>兒童的樂園</p>
<h3>童話　大蛇的谷</h3>
<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>會稽山的山麓，有一個很小的材莊。村莊裏住有一個獵人與一位樵夫，獵人名呌王四，樵夫名呌張三，這兩個人，都是很懶的，但是他們都發着大財，一天到晚，幻想發財的事。有一天，兩人一塊見正在談說怎樣可以發財的方法，凑巧來了一位老人，那老人聽到他們的話，微笑的對他們說道··[你們想發財，何不到那邊的山中去，我從的聽說那道邊的山谷内，有金銀寳貝很多，這財寳是洪楊亂時，有一位富翁，逃難到山谷時，藏下來的，可是這些財寳，很不容易取出，因爲有一條大蛇守護谷口，從前有人去探寳，都被大蛇咬死的，所以近數十年内，没有人敢再去。］王四張三齊聲答道··［那是很容易的，我們兩人身邊，都備有刀斧槍彈，不怕什麽猛獸蛇，倘若眞有這事，就是犧牲生命也甘願的，請你老人家告訴我們那財寳的地方罷。］那老人對他們說道··［過了這山的山崗，再向右轉灣，向前約五六十步有二十餘株大松樹，在松林的北方，有一深谷，道谷就是大蛇護寳的谷了。］王四與張三聽到這句話，狂喜雀躍，急忙的辭别了老人，搶步上山去了。他們一面走，一面說道··［倘若我們得了財寳，應當平均分配，不能私自欺隱。一二人對天立誓，不多時看見前面有一松林，來到松林的北方，霧氣瀰漫，遍地找尋，果然看見一深谷，二人大喜，各自預備槍刀，向山谷中奮勇而進，約走了二三丈地方，發見了無數的金塊銀條，二人眉飛色舞，呆然相對，王四對張三說道··［那老頭子說這裏有大蛇守護，我們進谷以來，却没有什麽東西阻礙；眞使我不懂極了。］張三道··［這是老頭子想獨占這裏的財寳，故意欺騙我們的。］王四道··［我們趕緊把這財寳搬運出去罷。］那張三看了如許財寳，忽然起了歹心，就是他人想獨得這洞内的財寳，因對王四說道··［你看如許財寳，我們二人不能運回去，請你先歸家中，做好了飯，再牽了驢了來，我在這裏收拾好金銀，等到你牽驢子來時，就可在谷口一同裝載驢背上了。］王四道··［你一個人在這裏，倘若大蛇出來時，怎樣好呢？］張三道··［我有大斧在身邊，儘可放心，你的槍彈放在這裡，也可以預防大蛇來時抵抗之用。］王四諾諾而去，到了家中，他又起了歹心，他自已先吃好了飯，用毒藥放在給張三吃的飯菜中，暗地裏想道··［張三狗賊的命運，就在我手掌中了。］他忽忽的牽了驢子上山來，這時張三正在松林下伺候王四，看見王四走到半山，卽忙對準了放槍，砰的一聲，那王四便飲彈而死。張三見王四已死，遂走到王四身邊，牽子驢子到了谷口，獨自坐在石上，呵呵大笑道··［這許多財寳，都爲我人所得，終身享受不盡了。］一面說一面在驢背上解下飯菜，狼吞虎嚼的吃完，剛欲起身去搬運金銀，却突然的腹痛如絞，中毒倒地而死。這樣循環的報應，都是由貪得無厭互相嫉忌而起，害人反害已，眞是一椿痛快的故事啊。</p>

<h3>銅元又縮二千五百文</h3>
<p>—江廣兩角平穩—</p>
<p>昨日江南小洋、早午兩市交易稀少、故市價無甚升降、收盤同爲八百三十七元、較前日午市跌小五角、做小交易早市九千五百角、午市竟無交易、廣東小洋、早市爲七百八十六元七角、午市爲七百八十六元二角、結果較前午僅好四角、做出交易早市四萬五千角、午市六萬五千角、銅元因連日天雨、電車上收入不多、不能大宗應市、致無貨可供、交易轉寥、市價於是奇縮二千五百文、爲三百零五千文、做出交易二萬七千九百五十串、計代價洋九千元、</p>

<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市面平穩而稍見混沌、大户交易已稀、散户買賣頗不寂莫、觀測市場人心、仍屬堅張、因買方猶作困獸之　、多頭稍有結出、故市價略見疲象、上午開盤、大致平疲、中問因掉期關係、如一九善後遠期、及廿關統稅尚略好五分至二角五分、其餘則均小去五分至一二角不等、次盤除編遣略好五分或一角外、其他均又小去五分至三角、午後兩盤、多空掉期交易爲多、平穩無甚榮辱、市價結果、亦漲跌互見、大槪跌多漲少、惟爲數基小、不出五分至一角五分範圍、趨勢恐不易遽跌、因存積數目卽鉅、且浮空亦不少、目下或將有一度盤旋也、成交總數、計共五百八十五萬八千元、内現貨八千元、期貨統鹽稅共一百九十六萬、裁兵佔八十四萬五千、一九關善共六十二萬五千、廿播廿關共一百四十五萬、九六做四十五萬、餘則數萬至十餘萬而已、市塲通告雙十節停市一天、</p>

<h3>紗花　美棉跌風襲擊標紗花</h3>
<p>紗市趨疲、且跌風尤熾、因有二十支人鐘、富貴紗解進倉庫中、一方面在期貨市塲套賣、由此人心又虛、賣風突起、但某廠之多頭、仍購進加碼、實需尚好、前途情形殊乏把握</p>

<p>棉市轉落、因美棉下跌、人心稍軟、有一部份獲利多頭了結、但氣候仍惡劣、且各路出貨受其影響、故對於市價看高之念未絶、漢口有大暴雨、該帮亦稍有購進、現棉銷路尚堪維持</p>

<h3>糧食　河下米節後銷塲大動</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三十餘號、市况績呈生氣、近以節前店户存底不多、今則節關已過、相繼採備、故初市開手形勢就見活躍、後以到船有限、一路見俏、雖客帮未動、毫無影響、直至收市未見稍有挫風、惟各貨行情、上下參差不一、計各破粳上升二角之譜、薄稻則高一二角不等、各新尖略好角許、至窰中百哥等價亦提高角外、陰元仍俏、變元無市、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各帮來源三十一二號、市上各種去路懈勢、惟破粳續化、市形中次白破粳變元埠尖加起近尺、中次新粳稍帶緊勢、新陳羊杜客尖團尖茭白尖等價無甚上落、薄粳窰種價小近尺、東新粳又加兩角、</p>
<h3>中次客秈疲跌角許</h3>
<p>—高秈到少銷活—</p>
<p>昨日客秈因車輪到申甚多、存底又充、去路不及日前之旺、故存到兩多之中次各檔、一律疲落角許、中關以上者頗爲閩粤及本街問津、市面仍可站住、但目下粤省需要甚旺之各屬、均直接向湘皖採辦、而産地亦在計劃盡量搬運來申、故此後客秈市况、尚難預料、惟冀閩浙及本街暢銷之外、再開闢北洋去路、方可得以繼續上展也、昨日閩帮辦去京機秈七百包、湖南糙靖三百多包、本街去南京糙米五百包、及少數湖南糙米、甬帮祗去江西機晚一百包、汕頭稍爲問津湘糙、售開江西晚米七元四角半、湖南糙米五元七角半至四角半、南京機米六元六角半至四角九分、又糙米五元四角半至三角八分云、</p>
<h3>標粉爲追證停拍　今日是否開拍全視集議結果</h3>

<h3>洋麥活動斯麥直落</h3>
<p>昨期麥市面、上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平寂之態、以洋麥報價、芝加哥又跌四五角左右坎拿大小四分不等、故開價後、各月份人心、均見平平、遠期因環境所趨、尤感不利、故市氣尤形虛弱、迨至下午開盤、各月份市面、又見急轉直下、洋麥方面、對於兜售洋麥、異常活動、向廠家抛賣價格、又落至四元三角半、而各廠因粉銷停頓、一時尚無意接受、惟國外傾銷之空氣、則已滿佈市塲、所以遠期之跌度、遂愈有力也、結果本月份較前日跌五分、十一月份跌五分、十二月份跌七分、一月份跌七分、二月份跌九分、三月份跌一角四分、現麥市面、交易仍不見暢、廠家大多無胃、祗福新應酬做開、貨多中次、價亦平值、聞高郵麥三元七角半、　潼麥三元七角半、大橋麥三元七角二分、露筋麥三元七角、計四千</p>
<p>餘包、</p>
<p>絲茶　海外絲價一落千丈</p>
<h3>里昻廠經又跌一法郎</h3>
<p>昨據信孚洋行傳出確訊、里昻生絲市塲、近因日絲濫跌傾銷、致華絲價難立住、白廠經Ａ級（加金雙鹿廠房圖金銀猫等牌）每基羅祗開九十一法郎、較週五又跌一法郎、扯合華幣每包價祗九百元强云、</p>
<h3>黄絲頭運德寥落</h3>
<p>黄絲頭德銷久無起色、出口寥落、昨日德郵寳司盤號由滬開出、祗福來德等裝往亨堡、計江北尾巴及川巾子等五十四件云、</p>
<h3>歐美絲銷無生氣</h3>
<p>邇來紐約等處絲織廠等工潮蔓延、生絲銷費日减、一般囤户咸將手中存絲積極競銷、里昻英倫日絲傾銷如故、致絲價一落千丈、電轉絲價益小、紐約Ｂ級廠經來價祗六百二·三十元、廠方益難抛售、市氣沈靜、昨祗達豐等進黄白廠經三十包、價益不振云、</p>
<h3>糖市　青糖做開二百餘包</h3>
<p>昨日糖市以關金略小、菏滙徵長、趨勢轉平、公會划盤二四組砂白普通貨划二十一元五角八分、稍有成交、二十號中砂折呌二十元九角、十八號二十元七角、荷赤高貨ＭＫＧＢ嘜呌十六元九角、ＮＴ嘜呌十元六角、均未成交、中華國華振記一號棉白呌二十元六角、太古Ｂ嘜二十一元六角半、潮帮號家開出提莊青十六元、以次爲十五元八角至十五元三角、共百餘包、建帮號家開出油包刁青一百包、十四元七角、上檔潮青號存不多、而地價頗堅、故開價有轉緊之勢轼</p>
<h3>南北貨　泉州大粒元略有開出</h3>
<p>日前建帮所到首批、泉州大泡桂圓、昨已見樣、頂大粒貨品高超者開八十元許、以次差二三元至四五元不一、惟中下檔以有别路貨軋脚、頗難發展、故不易善沽、大約今日可以續開云、</p>
<h3>五金　會司鐵供過于求</h3>
<p>會司鐵新近到貨充斥、而出路寥少、大有供過于求之槪、標準逐步鬆動、現市祗開三十元、比前小五角、聞大批買賣尚可便宜一元光景、</p>
<h3>油市　柏油趨勢日疲</h3>
<p>柏油銷塲、自入秋後清淡異常、而各處存積、漢口爲最厚、如麻城油總數在一萬以上、連重荆·平荆·枝江·津市等油、共有三萬餘件、而銷路則僅屬零星、蓋皂廠用度、因牛油及椰子油較廉、故對於柏油久不過問、所靠燭淘所用、數極有限、故荆宣枝津麻等處運漢銷售者、數亦不少、致漢市存積、反較春夏兩季爲厚、若以往年而衡、每屆秋令、因新貨將出、陳油到處漸銷漸少今漢市反厚、市面自非猛跌不可、近一月來之一再跌價、實由於此、乃連日適在中秋、均忙忙於結賬、交易更寥、而江浙兩省存雖較薄、然産新以前、恐亦不能銷罄、致漢市向以江浙爲出路者、漸趨絶望、聞漢市重荆祇售二十元尚弱、而麻城油十九元恐尚難立足、如是一落千丈之勢、已屬顯然、惟中秋後尚有一批淘銷、不識能否藉此中流砥柱也、本埠行家存積本已不多、乃因銷太清淡、不能不再跌售價、或冀引動淘户興味、計定重荆每擔二十四元五角、平荆二十四元至二十三元五角、麻城每檐二十二元五角、但此等定價、亦是虛有其名、暗中降落不一、總因市面不佳、表裏互異、積習如是、無足爲怪也、</p>
<h3>輕皮生油慘淡一元</h3>
<p>花生油自夾倉泊兒膠州油跌價後、惟輕皮生油因買方不貪、且到積兩稀、故至今有月餘未開、市塲中除生油呆木、豆油亦然僵擯、所以賣方將輕皮生油賤售三百件、以振市塲人心、其價開十三元一角、較前之末盤慘跌一元有奇、</p>

<p>服裝特刊　第伍期</p>
<h3>時裝及其經濟之影響　奇特的志趣　狂亂的裝飾</h3>
<p>— 許弢</p>
<p>衣服的入時裝飾的華麗，幾乎爲一個摩登女子的必需品。式樣，顔色，圖案，迅速不斷的變遷，使人莫測，不知其來源，更不知其去處，愛好摩登的女子，只知流行什麽，穿着用着什麽；連自已也不知其所以然。但是社會由時裝的更替，日趨浮華洋化，引起了無數的讚美毁謗的輿論；所以在目前，對於這個問題，確有討論的趣味。</p>
<p>表面　看，以爲這是個很簡單的問題；但細細的研究，就可覺到無限的困難。我對此實無研究，不過借他人的所見，來一談罷了。爲簡明起見，暫把這問題，分三部份來討論。</p>
<p>（一）什麽是時裝</p>
<p>（二）怎樣創造流行時裝</p>
<p>（三）時裝的經濟影響</p>
<p>我們可以說，時裝是種慣常需要的變化，是動的，决不固定的，又是無關緊要的；並且對於最瑣碎的花樣和形狀的變化，使人不知其究竟了。法國Voliaire曾經這樣的說··</p>
<p>它是個無恒，不慣，絶熙的美女。</p>
<p>奇特的它的志趣，狂亂的它的裝飾。</p>
<p>好像逃去了，但仍姗姗而回，時時永遠的生存着。</p>
<p>它的父親就是無主見者，它的名字，就是時裝。］</p>
<p>我們只得自已承認人類是時裝的奴隷，時裝隨着了人間的偏情，是最無理最狂亂的新式花樣的媒介物</p>
<h3>旗袍的硬領</h3>
<p>其實時裝不過老舊得像世界一樣，假使把頭回過去一看，同時也是永遠的更始。可是去後的再來，修改過一副面目罷了。至於證物，只須把滿人的旗袍，和近年女子的服裝來比較，已可瞭然。就是現在時行的高而硬的領，和二十年前的元寳領，也很近似。雖是這樣，可是女子的時裝，却是十二分的複雜，而又不可捉摸的。旣不聽命於規則，又不受處於法律。我們竟可把時裝歸納到Ｖ，irgite所說的話裏去··　　［幸福的，能認識世物原因的人。］</p>
<p>其實時裝有她自已的原理，但眞理並不認識的。</p>
<h3>裸臂露腿與高跟鞋</h3>
<p>那末究竟怎樣創造流行時裝呢？</p>
<p>各時代所經過的時裝歷史，對我們常帶指着··因了什麽瑣碎的原因，變故和偶然的事件，往往牽連了某種傳滿世界的時裝，並且在時紀裏還留印了特殊永遠的遺跡。有時時裝的出現，往往由公主的奇形，皇后的娱樂，或由一戲劇以及政治的變化而産生，如下面所述的幾個例子··</p>
<p>法王路易十一的女兒，因爲脚生得太大，所以創做了拖到脚上的長衣·</p>
<p>美麗的，Ferronnicre，在面額的正中，却有個燒疤，佩帶了細線做練的寳石，遮蔽着這個傷痕。</p>
<p>奥國的Ａnne皇后，她的手臂生得十二分的潔白豐滿，所以創行了露臂無袖的衣服。</p>
<p>Ｍadame　de　pampadour，身腰阿娜如柳，創行了没有後帮的高底拖鞋。</p>
<p>在國内，朝代的更換，服裝同時起了變化，更不必說。就是最近革命成功，中山裝就將時盛行。　有曲線　美等名目一起，貼身露腿的衣服隨之而生；同時足登高跟皮鞋，剪髮蓬燙</p>
<h3>二二秋式之新縀桂與襇襇袍</h3>
<p>— 玄相女士</p>
<p>我向來不顧把自已的服裝，完全靠託裁縫司務，更不願慕仿時下流行的服裝；　　因爲上海女子的服裝，以前很多是由妓女們首先創製，而奶奶小姐們，反去慕仿。</p>
<p>秋天的衣服，最難，因爲當有風雨，尤其是晚上，比較的很凉。所以衣服要求美觀而過宜於天氣，裁製是很難的。</p>
<p>在［已凉天氣未寒時］的秋天，假使携帶一件秋大衣，似乎還嫌早；假使穿一件絨線半臂，也覺得並不十分美觀。</p>
<p>現在我自已裁製了一套衣服，一件呌做［桂］（卽短披肩）一件是普通的旗袍·略加變化。旗袍用乣縵縐爲材料，兩袖很長大，但是袖口，均用寬緊帶，以便懸套在肩下，（與今年流行的女西裝袖一樣）只因衣又開得很長，旣嫌太凉，又覺不雅觀，所以選擇與札縵縐色澤相仿的素喬其紗儼細襇，織在衣义裡，使衣的下擺，特别寛大，走路的時候，星　逸有致。</p>
<p>那件［桂］是用二重緞所製，也是單的。二重　是正反面相同，一面是紅色，一面是黑色，隨便那一面，都可以做正面或反面，領圈上縫一條三寸半　的一條長飄帶，可以圍在頸項謿，當作園巾用，垂在背上，或胸前，都不成問題，假使天氣稍爲暖一些，便可以脫下，放在臂上，也不討厭；天氣稍爲東些，或在晚上，便把他穿上，他十分美觀。自從我裁製穿上了身，許多女友及姊妹們，都已仿製了。我自以爲一些也不俗，而且氣派是非常莊重與高貴，毫無　佻之意，而且是道樣的美麗。</p>
<p>。</p>
<h3>打襇的褲子與軍裝女大衣</h3>
<p>不過在現代的歐美稍有不同一切的時裝、幾乎都由幾家大的縫衣店所創作包辦。現在上海，時裝公司也有不少，大半還是抄弄歐美的樣本。這些店家，聘有專門的人才，設想圖樣出來，再由作模形的女子，穿着宣傳於公衆，好像上海的時裝大會；或由廣告，雜誌，戲院，電影，以及浮華的宴會來推廣。世界聞名的時裝雜誌，Ｖogue就是在滬上也可購得到。在那預告着各季時裝的才料顔色奇形的式樣。</p>
<p>到此，我們又將發生這樣的疑問··這些專門創作時裝的人，究竟從那裡受到了感影呢？其實有很多的源泉，使他們在想像上發生了影響··最先，就是目前的事實，特殊的事件，戰爭等，都能形成某時裝或某時裝的借身。所以在Ｌouis-philippe時，全巴黎的風流公子，都想穿着膝部打　的褲子，好像非洲的獵兵一樣。就是國内近年男子服裝的洋化，多少受了歐美的影響。有的時裝，也由文學上受到感影的；例如從前繼續的戴着Atapa領和Ｍarie-stuart無邊帽子·浪漫主義，曾表顯着特殊的性質，就是返原國家的習慣，中古時代式，例如在金銀細工裏，首飾都成峩特式，粗大的鐵手戒，衛從戴着蛾毛高聳的帽子，盔兜，國章，盾形，勛章，整個的封建製造局，完全用金銀雕刻和琺瑯質所造成。最近報上也登着，立體派的人，在羅馬戴着奇形怪狀的帽子。而我們國内，在去冬起，女子的大衣形式與軍官們的外衣一樣，身前，身後，綴滿了許多黄的白的銅鈕子，至少從璇宫艶史影片裏的希佛來漂亮服裝一樣，我以爲也要受着［九一八］［一二八］兩次戰事的影響，女子們，也有從軍的想像。（未完）</p>
<h3>棉衣淘汰論</h3>
<p>— 一縷</p>
<p>十年前，女子都穿短衣，到了初冬，就得用棉絮衣。考究的，用綫切成各種花紋。蘇州行聘的五時吉衣，棉夾單紗，棉是少不掉的。自從旗袍進化以後，棉絮就漸歸淘汰。因爲棉衣無論襯得少，總有些臃腫的。取而代之，却是襯絨和駱駝絨。</p>
<p>襯絨自然最熨貼，要是已凉未寒天氣，或是暴冷暴熱，單夾太寒酸，駱駝絨太燠暖，用襯絨最適當了。到了深冬，皮太重，就得用駱駝絨。就經濟問題說，這兩種也是最合算。</p>
<p>還有襯布的，比襯絨更便宜，並且可以把褪色或是陳舊的布衣襯進去，而其效用，和襯絨不相上下的。</p>
<p>這們一來，棉衣就不能不退避三舍了。不過，晚妝，在繡闥裏，卸去長衣，穿上一龔嬌艶的短棉衣，或是薄棉半臂，倒很有詩意的。白居易詩··［桂布白似雪，吳綿軟如雲，布重綿且厚，爲裘有餘温。］可見棉衣比皮衣好得多。所以我以爲棉衣不適於對外，而適於對内，不必完全淘汰。</p>
<h3>現代女裝之配色法</h3>
<p>— 儀翔</p>
<p>（續）</p>
<p>白　主色</p>
<p>白爲色類之最潔品，素而有威，凈而有艶，濯濯出塵，因爲色中之無上品，亦爲顔色之始祖，故歐美女士夏秋兩季之衣服，以此爲之，取其潔凈超羣，不染塵沙故也。且附屬色以鮮艶爲宜，蓋潔而帶艶，如出水芙蓉，更具美觀矣。兹將合宜附色書之，</p>
<p>（附合色）青　玫瑰紅　漢黄　黑品藍</p>
<p>黑　主色</p>
<p>黑爲色中之最沉者，其容靜穆，其意深濃，占色中之最重地位，故歐美女士樂製爲衣，以其雅而宜，得大方之態度故也，然正色旣沉，其佐色須凈，以附賓主之位，愈見精彩矣。</p>
<p>（附合色）紅　青　白　灰色　品藍</p>
<p>深灰色　屬黑</p>
<p>章華眞駱駝毛雙層冬大衣呢織造圖</p>
<p>深灰一色，不染塵埃，故常服多用之，其配色如左。</p>
<p>（附合色）青　玫瑰紅　藍</p>
<p>灰色　屬黑</p>
<p>灰色亦老成色之一種，鄭重而雅，故人多樂用之，配宜如左。</p>
<p>（附合色）品藍　玫瑰紅淡藍青蓮</p>
<h3>鴻翔公司十七週紀念　舉行時裝表演會</h3>

<h3>家庭日新會與服裝標準</h3>
<p>— 仰芬</p>
<p>三年以前，爲改良服裝問題，家庭日新會同人，在史量才先生府上開會討論，到會的會員··</p>
<p>男會員二四人，女會員四○人，男學生十五人，女學生二十一人，男會員二十四人中，六十歲以上者一人，五十歳以上者三人，四十歲以上者七人，三十歲以上者五人，二十歲以上者八人，女會員四○人中，五十歲以上者二人，四十歲以上者五人，三十歲以上十一人，二十歲以上者二十二人，男女學生三十六人，大都是在十五歲以上二十歲以下。還有不滿十五歲的，吾也記不清楚了。討論的情形，大部份爲四種，一是普通服裝，二是西裝，三是女子服裝，四是童裝。討論的標準，分爲四項··</p>
<p>一質科　國産的，經濟的。</p>
<p>二形式　美觀的，勇武的。</p>
<p>三顔色　樸素的，文雅的。</p>
<p>四體裁　靈便的，適用的。</p>
<p>在這年紀不同性别不同，思想不同，觀念不同的許多會員中間，居然公定了這四個標準，大家没有異議，眞正是一件難得的事情。當時大家還拍過一張照，因爲個個人穿的布衣，有人便稱做布衣大會。展覽了各家所别出心裁的服裝，有人便釋做服裝展覽會。個個人都認爲在家庭方面，開一個新紀元。當時鴻新染織廠的出品，居然出色當行，博得不少贊美的。吾偶然從日記中見到這段記載，再把四個標準，也來申說一下··</p>
<p>一質料方面　國産的衣料，可說樣都有，綢緞當推美亞，呢絨，要算章華，布疋當推鴻新，都是價格便宜，合於經濟的原則。</p>
<p>二形式方面　美觀似乎没有準繩，但第一要避俗氣，第二要避火氣，第三要避邪氣。要　　以壯美健美爲主旨，綫可稱爲勇武。記得鴻新，美亞兩家爲這一點，費去不少研究工夫。</p>
<p>三顔色方面　以樸實，素淡，文雅爲主旨，不取奢侈，煊染，嬌艶。認定了這目標，那麽綢緞也好，呢絨也好，布疋也好。這種配色鴻翔公司是富有老經騐了。</p>
<p>四體裁方面　禦寒當取呢絨，輕盈當採綢緞，尊嚴而大方，當推國布。而總以靈便適體爲指歸。大家都知鴻翔公司，在此中是煞費苦心的。</p>
<p>這一次討論會以後，家庭服裝，改革了不少，最容易看得到的；</p>
<p>一都是採用了國貨，被美亞，章華，鴻新三家，多做了許多的生意。</p>
<p>二穿妖艶服裝的，完全没有了。</p>
<p>三小孩服裝　都是雄糾糾氣昻昻的。寬袍大袖的小老頭子，居然絶跡於各家家庭。</p>
<p>四各家服裝　都有一定準繩，一年的衣服費，有了簡制，於家庭經濟上，得到很大的效益。</p>
<p>現在家庭日新會的小會員，都大起來了，大家還記得那天討論時；你們的小手，還是舉得很高高的嗎？</p>

<h3>人之所以異於禽獸者</h3>
<p>— 致立</p>
<p>反戰會的代表已經紛紛離滬了，前幾天的一種英文報上便出現了一幅漫畫，一艘出口的船，一艘進口的船，出口的船上載着幾個反戰會的代表！人，進口的船上戴着許多獅象虎豹丨獸。</p>
<p>眞可謂大快人心。無中生有，弄得人心惶惶的什麽馬萊爵士等等出口了，讓他們到［太平洋上］或者［海底］去開［反戰大會］罷！而這回是，德國海京堡的大馬戲班到滬了·世界聞名的！</p>
<p>上海是要大大地熱鬧了，上海人是要大大地開心了，看呀，看呀！</p>
<p>戰爭，我們爲什麽要反對？不必說二十四史是相斫書，就是近十年來，我們那一天不曾看到戰爭？說慣，我們久已慣了，至於說可怕，只要炸彈不落到我們的頭上，也有何可怕，誰曾在戲臺上看到羅通盤陽大戰而覺得可怕呢？而且，那還是多麽有趣喲！拉斯庚（Ｒuskin）不是說過麽？［戰爭是人類所舉行的一切競技（Ｇame）中規模最大價值最高的一種。］戰爭原來是Ｇame，是Ｓhort，那是多麽開心的一回事喲！誰不願意看看西班牙的鬥牛戲，誰不希望見見古羅馬的Ｇladiator？遠東運動，全國·全省運動會已是那麽熱鬧了，何况那世界戰爭的［大觀］？何况當第一次世界大戰的時候，我們豈不是從容地作壁上觀，而且事後還不是成了戰勝國之一麽？</p>
<p>戰爭，我們爲什麽要反對？而且海京堡大馬戲班，不是爲全世界所歡迎麽？那裏面全是獅象虎豹，野蠻的獸類。人類比獸類還野蠻麽？人類的大規模的競技比獸類的大規模的競技還不如麽？</p>
<p>去罷，你們馬萊爵士的一行，到别處去罷！</p>
<p>Ｗolcome，德國海京堡大馬戲班！</p>
<p>上海是要大大地熱鬧了，上海人是要大大地開心了，看呀，看呀！</p>

<h3>論劉克莊的詩</h3>
<p>— 何如</p>
<p>南宋時代有所謂江湖詩派，這是因爲有一個書店老板陳起，編刻了江湖集而得名的。這派詩人雖然也和同時的四靈派詩人一樣，詩學晚唐，但不甚注意字句鍜鍊。好做諷剌詩，好用近事做詩料。而且有人借詩去干謁鑽營，大敲竹槓，如宋謙夫投謁賈似道，得楮幣二十萬緡，用造華屋之類。這等詩人眞夠得上［走江湖］了！</p>
<p>江湖派詩人著名的有劉克莊，樂雷發，戴復古，葉紹翁，劉過姜夔，方岳諸人，其中以劉克莊的詩名爲最大。劉克莊一生作詩很多，數量在陸游楊萬里之間，有他自已的詩爲證··</p>
<p>八十吟（十首録一）</p>
<p>誠翁僅有四千首，惟放翁幾滿萬篇。老子胸中有殘錦，問天乞與放翁年。原來他是極其佩服揚誠齋陸放翁的，這也有詩爲證··</p>
<p>題放翁像</p>
<p>三百篇寂寂久，九千首句句新。</p>
<p>譬宗門中初祖，自過江後一人。</p>
<p>題誠齋像</p>
<p>歐陽公屋畔人，呂東萊派外詩。</p>
<p>海外咸推獨步，江西横出一枝。</p>
<p>他到老不忘趕上陸楊的地位，他的病起一詩道··</p>
<p>變風而下世無詩，初學西崑壯恥爲。老去僅名小家數，向來曾識大宗師。百年不覺皤雙鬢，一字誰能斷數髭？誠齋放翁幾日死，著鞭萬一肩相隨。　　他的詩有兩個特點，一是好做六言絶句，一是好用本朝故事。從來詩人隸事，以爲愈古愈妙，他偏好用當時一般人都熟悉的近事。例如［每嘲介甫行新法，常恨歐公不讀書。］［迂叟相邀入眞率，乖崖安肯慕輕肥。］［康節易傳於隱者，濂溪學得自高僧。］［野人只識羹芹美，相國安知食筍甘！］（自注·富鄭公事。）這類句子都可做例·他曾有詩句道··</p>
<p>憂時元是詩人職，</p>
<p>莫怪吟中感慨多。</p>
<p>這似乎也是他好用近事入詩的一個理由罷。但他已捱受［詞病質俚，意傷淺露·］或是［油腔滑調，江湖末流］的識評了。</p>
<h3>古事記</h3>
<p>— 小雪</p>
<p>要說一九三三是一個國貸年，那麽，凉秋九月，也是抵得一個［古物復興月］的。古物，什麽時候都在從灰土裏［努力望上爬］（敬用適之博士詩句），何以獨特的對這個月要冠上［復興］二字呢？這原故，就是因爲復古似乎已經形成運動，而近月來，連空氣也頗有些古味也。</p>
<p>謂予不信，何妨一讀凉秋九月的［古事記］··</p>
<p>（一）曰··建孔廟，剏經書學堂（新嘉坡，路透社電）。</p>
<p>（二）曰··限用毛筆，抵制外國文具（廣州，路透電）。</p>
<p>（三）曰··古墓源源發現（南昌，山東專電）。</p>
<p>（四）曰··金質婚書，特别放盤（天津，中央社電）。</p>
<p>［懿歟聖哉］，一月成績，竟然如此，這樣努力下去，［漢代衣冠］旣不會［成古邱］，我［泱泱大國］也眞要復興有望了。閒來無事，想到這裏，總是高興。並非遐想，我認爲那時的人，一定穿着戲台上的花衣服，在官道上擺來擺去，見人拱手，高呌［相公請了］。而過有情殺事件時，一定是那英雄拖着雪亮的什麽刀，大踏步走上［鴛鴦樓］，再來幾回［血濺］，使Ｘ報記者更能寫得有聲有色，香艶肉感一點。</p>
<p>洋鬼子呢？那時是不會像現在這樣［猖獗］的，這些夷狄之邦，一定會震於［漢國盛］，每年進貢來朝，以恢復往昔盛事。想到他們那時從午門一直膝行到金龍殿，伏地高呼萬歲不敢抬頭；連憶及現在他們對中國的壓迫，他們的醜態，眞是會呌我有飄飄然之感。雖說也擔心那時再來一個金兀术或者安禄山。</p>
<p>根據歷史的事實看去，復古終竟是好的，中國除掉復古也［别無話說］。不過，一想到歷代皇后的［金質婚書］終不免爲［夷狄］買去，指定用毛筆而仍不能不主張用自來水筆［寫英文］，以至［聖廟］雖收到錢迄未興造，［古屍見風即成灰燼］，却又不免有些［色變］了。嗚呼！崇今固不可，復古多少又有些渺茫，寫罷了［古事記］，祇有把我自已擱在［動摇］的架上了，［追求］云乎哉！</p>
<h3>怒吼罷中國</h3>
<p>— 董每戡</p>
<p>黑的夜幕籠罩着大地，僅有的幾　星星在　　中閃　着，銜燈吐出興　的光芒，我在銜燈的光芒中走着，難說時候才是初秋，夜寒却很夠勁兒了，穿着單薄的衣服，徽感寒氣侵人，我懷着滿肚子的熱誠，沉默地走着，走向劇塲去，在喧鬧的市聲還没有疲乏的街道上。</p>
<p>一路走去，街上的一切在我的無意中溜了過去，　然，我想起四年前某夜在東京，一怒吼罷，中國］的情形。</p>
<p>記得那是一個初冬的晚上，東京的空氣已是非常寒冷了，我受了兩位朋友的約，在半夜時分，跑到新築地劇塲去看［怒吼罷，中國］的預演。</p>
<p>時間到了，工作的人們懷着熱烈的情緒和果敢的精神在工作着；觀衆們也興奮地瞪着眼睛聚精會神地在看着，戲劇的釁園氣漸次緊張起來，同情的憤怒漲滿了各個人的心丨演員的心，觀衆的心，怒吼起來了，劇塲中的人們，頓時整個劇塲被吼聲充滿了，幾乎要　破了劇場的四壁。</p>
<p>我們足足看了半夜，一直到第二天清晨，極興奮地走出了劇塲，回到自已的寓所，那玫瑰色的太陽已爬上東方的天際了。我滿想再去看他們的公演，可是晚上就是我的歸期，没法，就在夜裏離開了東京。</p>
<p>想着，想着，劇塲到了，講票進去，　大的塲所，已坐滿了看戲的人，我向四周看了一下，竟在每一排座位中，幾乎都有認識的朋友坐着，就是那些不是我的朋友的人們，也都覺得頗爲面熟似的。</p>
<p>幕啟，一羣在苦難之中掙扎着次殖民地——中國的民衆們，在受着所謂白種人的外國商人的叱駡，鞭撻，事件漸次展了開來，這善苦力們和某帝國的順民起了交涉，爲的是次殖民地中國的苦力打死了和他們一樣有着白色皮膚的外國商人，於是在舞臺上燃起了償悵的烈熖，産生出虐待，壓迫，絞殺，鬥爭等種種姿態，現在我們目前的是這些，這些次殖民地國家常受的苦痛，時種在我們心謿的是償悵，反抗，鬥爭的種子。同樣地，戲劇恊社的同志們在臺上緊張的工作着，觀衆們　奮地聚精會种地看着，戲劇的零　氣濃厚起來了，觀衆的心跟着緊張起來了，終於同樣地現出了償恨的怒吼聲，我們，整個劇塲裡的人，只要是人，都怒吼起來了，立刻，吼聲漲滿了整個劇塲，四壁幾乎脹破了。</p>
<p>這時候，黄金大戲院中的人們在怒吼着，也許中國的各地也像這裏一樣地在怒吼着，帝國主義者一天一天地只管在侵略，半殖民地的民衆也早已捲入反帝的浪潮中儘在喊呌着，怒吼罷！中國！怒吼罷！是的，中國是終究會怒吼起來的。</p>
<p>舞臺上射出了鮮麗而熱烈的光明，悲壯的戲就此終了，觀衆的秩序起了混亂，向門口潮湧般擠了出去，債恨，反抗，鬥爭，脹滿各人的熱烈的心，—你的心，我的心，他的心，一切次殖民地奴𨽻們的心！</p>
<p>我很興奮地向我的寓所走去，心謿的熱血在沸騰着，耳中仍未消失去剛才羣衆的吼聲，我想··中國是終要怒吼的，怒吼罷，中國！怒吼罷，中國！</p>
<h3>關着的門（三）</h3>
<p>— Henri　de　Regnier著　李萬居譯</p>
<p>下面就是這聲音所講的··</p>
<p>［啊！那些可憐虫·他們竟不知道他們幹的是什麽事。這班人裏面，竟没有一個人顧盧到祖國的命運！他們爲着他們目前的微之又微的利益·犧牲了一切。難道他們竟不知道未來是要用那無情的天秤來秤量他們的行爲嗎！難道他們裡面竟没有一個人肯把他們的行爲向他們自已告發，並使他們顧到廉恥　？啊！假使我在那兒，我會把他們所奔赴的恥辱的深淵指給他們看，他們會採納我的話，因爲從前大家是聽我的話的呀。但是·現在，完了。我用自已的手勒死了自已。我的生命之門是永遠關閉了。並且現在誰還會想起我，想起郎維耶，想起摩理斯·郎維耶呢！啊！可慘唷！可慘唷！······］</p>
<p>粗暴的一拳，撞在一樣傢具上，這傢具馬上嘩喇剌地倒下了，同時我還聽到一個婦人的温咽欲絶的噎聲。</p>
<p>摩理斯·郎維耶！突然·我明白了。摩理斯·朗維耶！這相隔二十年的穢聞　又浮上了我的腦中。我記起了我小時聽着人家談論的這和一宗著名的醜事有關的名字。朗維耶，這便是那燦爛的前途忽然沉　在一個無可救藥的失敗中的政治家。郎維耶·他原是一個巧練而有權威的演說家，他是　會裡面一個重要的派别的領袖·他是曾經有過他的光榮時代的，那曇花一現的光榮時代。並且我還想起了那時情勢的嚴重·外國人的猛烈的威脅，國家的混亂·和受着朗維耶的熱烈的言詞所激勵，在一種爘爛的愛國運動中·重橷　議的，一次值得紀念的國會的開會。後來，在那勝利的第二天，當衆人的希望都歸向那似乎被目爲［時代的主人］的當兒·朗維耶突告匿跡·我想起了他那奇怪的失蹝，秘密的逃遁。朗維耶抛棄了一切··家庭，責任·祖國·而挾了一個他所愛的但不能結婚的少女走了·爲了她，他憑着愛情犧牲了名譽和光榮。</p>
<p>我在門後所聽到的就是道位變名爲都爾蘭質先生的摩理斯·朗維耶，他在懷想起他過去的生涯，他那演說家的權威，同時並在懊悔在以前在一個熱情的瞬間做下的那無意思的犧牲。於是我不禁凄然想着現刻在兩重靜默中默一言的這婦人，剛才發出來的那一個嗚咽的噎聲。她付了多少的痛苦和怎樣的内疚來換那一時被愛的陶醉呢？啊！可憐的人們唷　當他們把那著名的艶事隱匿在一個假名之下，過着這樣飄泊和被放逐的生活的時候，他們的愛情還給他們留下了什麽呢！這是怎樣的命運啊，每天報紙送到的時候，團坐一家普通旅館裏的一張茶桌帝，在屋華這塊偏僻地方，他們組成了一對［耐人尋味的夫婦］，人家從這兒經過時，都帶着他們那憂　的影像走了。</p>
<p>假如大客廳裏那兩個英國人回房裏去的時候，没有喚醒我現在已是回房睡覺的時候了，我還會很久的站在他們那關着的門前冥想着呢。因爲我第二天清早就得動身，是應當早點去睡的。（完）</p>

<h3>眞空管使用須知</h3>
<p>— 明襄</p>
<p>號爲無　靈魂的眞空管，在一切無綫電機中所居地位，最爲重要，價值亦昻，所以使用時須極端審愼，稍不合法，輕則減短壽命，影響全機效率，重則毁之頃刻，姑列使用須知數則，以作玩好無綫電同志的座右銘。</p>
<p>一·眞空管銅脚·須保持十分清潔燈座彈簧片亦如此，銅脚與燈座接觸處，尤須緊貼嚴密，否則極易發生障礙。二·絲極電壓，切勿超過所規定者，如對於收音效果，無甚影響時，最好僅用至規定值的四分之三，此點可使眞空管壽命增長。</p>
<p>三·供給栅負電位的C電池（在交流機多利用電阻上的電壓降）電壓必須凖確，否則極易失眞。</p>
<p>四·屏電壓不宜過低，否則將使音量減弱，如電源係得自整流部電壓分位器上者，測量時必須必電阻極高的電壓表，太約每伏脫1000歐姆，方可凖確。</p>
<p>五，眞空管在無綫電機内所担任的工作，亦須依照製造廠商所規定者。不合宜的工作，萬難勝任。</p>
<p>六放大率極高（HiginMu）的眞空管，不可用於變壓器交連放大的綫路中，因此項配合，必使音質失眞。</p>
<p>七，乾電池式眞空管（俗稱省電燈炮如199，109，074等）絲極電壓，絶對不可超過規定值，因其燈絲最易燒斷。　　八，交流眞空管，屏栅回路，最好接至電源變壓器上供給燈絲電壓次級線圈的中心接頭，或用中分電阻亦可，如此連接可減少交流聲的騷擾。</p>
<p>九，眞空管不能受劇烈的震動，在絲極燃熱使用時，尤須平穩，故燈座之考究者，多裝有彈簧，以避免眞空管之因震動而損壞其燈絲。</p>
<p>十，少數釷層（ThoriumCoat）絲極的眞空管，如201A199222等，偶因使用不愼或使用過久後，絲極雖未燒斷已不能發射電子（俗稱啞子燈炮），仍可用適當方法，使之復活，復活方法，另文再述。</p>
<h3>單行天綫的本身波長</h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>常聞人說，我的天線長度是七十五呎，收聽甲電台發音很好，但把牠換了一百呎的，則收聽乙電台的發音，又較甲電台的響了·這是什麽緣故呢？原來天綫本身亦如扼制圈之有自感量，電容量，和電阻，所以自已就有一本身波長　　（Naturalwavelength）倘你收聽的那電台波長，恰與你天綫的波長相合時，則諧振最銳敏，感應電力亦最强；你的收音機輸入訊號電壓大，音量自然響亮了·</p>
<p>天綫的自感量，電容量和電阻，可以圖表示之··A爲天線。C爲地綫，L示其自感量，R示其電阻，C示其電容量。</p>
<p>單行水平天線的自感量公式爲··</p>
<p>L=2L（23logto2h1+14）X10-3·····（mh）</p>
<p>單行水平天線的電容量公式爲</p>
<p>C=L-46log102hrx1-9·····（mmf）</p>
<p>L爲自感量，單位爲兆分亨利（uh）C爲電容量，單位爲　　法拉（uuf）Ｉ爲天綫之長，r爲導線之半徑，h爲導綫與地面之距離，</p>
<p>由上二公式中可見··天綫的本身波長與天線的長度，高度，及電線直徑之大小有絶對關係。如大綫加長，則自感量，電容量與電阻，均有增加，天線加高，則僅增加其自感量，而减其電容量，電阻則不變·若天線减短其長度或减低其高度，則適相反，一根靈敏的天綫，須自感量大，而電容量與電阻小；所以天綫的高度愈高則愈佳。</p>
<p>單行天線的本身波長測算稍覺麻煩，兹從略。今介紹其已算出的波長表，摘録於下，以供參考·</p>

<p>有許多裝置收音機的人，以爲祇要天線裝得考究，便能得到優良的成績。因此他們對於地綫，是認爲無關重要的。其實，地線在收音機内所負的使命，並不較低於天線。</p>
<p>不良的地線，不僅對於收音成績會發生重大的影響，並且最易引起各種雜聲。——尤其是在交流機内，更易增加交流音或是發生許多奇怪的呌聲。</p>
<p>地線的良好與否，是以牠的本身電阻多少爲轉移的。測騐地綫電阻的方法，固然很多，但是如果没有精良的儀器，一時便無從下手。</p>
<p>普通外來的電源綫，（電燈綫或是電力綫等）大槪有一根是接通地綫的。（見附圖左方）倘若利用這一點裝置，便能解决上述的困難。</p>
<p>先將電壓表照常法測量外來的電壓，（見圖虛綫所示）假如測得的數值爲Ei，次將電壓表一端改接收音機的地綫，一端仍接電源綫A，（AB兩線，不能預知孰爲地綫，可換接之。）此時電壓表指針所示的數值（E2），如果··</p>
<p>（一）降至零點，即證明地綫已斷。</p>
<p>（二）顫動不已，即證明地線接觸點不良，或即將告斷。</p>
<p>（三）與E1相差極多，即證明地線本身電阻甚大。</p>
<p>（四）較E1略小，即證明地線本身略有電阻。</p>
<p>（五）與E1相近或相等，即證明該地線本身電阻極低。</p>
<h3>紀念愛迪生</h3>
<p>— 克銘</p>
<p>明天十月八日是愛迪生逝世的二週紀念日。這一天，是誰都應該記着的，愛迪生一生的事蹟和他的人格是多麽值得我們年青人的欽敬和模倣。他所發明的東西不知有多少。他曾試過［空間電報］到造［以太力］道一個名詞，他又在試騐電燈明發現熱絲上有電子發出，就是所謂［愛迪生効應］這於後來眞空管之發明是很有帮助的。</p>
<p>愛迪生在五十五歲前，每天工作時間平均十九小時半，在發明留聲機時，且有一次竟工作到五畫夜之久。他年青時喜歡把書中的實騐一一試過，對於衣服和修飾是不注意的，但對於書籍，儀器，藥品的購買，却毫不吝借。</p>
<p>因爲紀念愛迪生，我們就感到自已國内多麽需要發明的人，我們的國家已處於内憂外患的嚴重時勢中，所以我們希望也能有一個愛迪生生在中國以偉大的發明救濟民間疾苦而置國家於磐石之安。</p>
<p>末了，我們引一句愛迪生的名言，［天才是百之一靈感，百分之九十九血汗。］</p>
<h3>電力電容器之修造理與改造官</h3>
<p>— ]質冰</p>
<p>凡無線電交流機，在它的電力供給線路内，有濾波器（Ｆiltor）之名，它的組織，是拓制圈（Ｃhoke）和固定電容器二者合組而成。這種電容器，其容量較大，並且還要能勝任高電壓的荷載，因比它的構造很難，價值也就很高，因爲它的位置在高電壓的綫路内，又非常容易損壞，所以研究無線電的人，每每因爲它損壞了不易修復，多棄擲不用，實在是一件可惜而又無能爲力的事。</p>
<p>現在有一種修復和改造的方法，寫在下面，研究無線電的同志們，請照着這種法子去試做試做，或者能挽回你已失的金錢之一小部份。</p>
<p>要知道怎樣去修復，就先要明瞭它的構造，這種電容器的構造非常簡單，就是兩條很長的錫箔，間隔夾着三條很長的蠟紙捲屈而成的（有些是二組或三四組的捲屈所成的電容器並聯而成的）這三條蠟紙的作用是使兩條錫箔絶緣。　　它的損壞的原因，是某一小部份的絶緣不好或破壞，致兩錫箔成了短路，而失掉了容電的作用。</p>
<p>修復方法應先將外面金屬或紙板壳了留心的拆開，并留心的將其周圍附着蠟質或火漆等刮去，再次將此三層蠟紙二層錫箔所捲屈而成的電容器展開，在蠟紙的外端伸出錫箔之剩餘的部份剪下一方，將其損壞地方蠟紙破處，一層一層的粘貼起來，依舊捲屈如前，如此裝回原處而試，則作用當仍前不變。兹再將展開修理，和重捲時應注意之事項録後··</p>
<p>（一）展開時應注意之點··</p>
<p>一·外壳拆開後，附着於電容器四週之蠟質物，須留心刮去而不能傷損電容器之蠟紙與錫箔。</p>
<p>二·愼勿用火來溶化蠟質以妨燒毁蠟紙及溶化錫箔。</p>
<p>三·展開電容器時，須慢慢地留心着蠟紙撕破和兩邊沿拉缺，不易捲復原狀。</p>
<p>四·展至電容器燒毁之處，須視察其共燒毁幾層，將其燒毁各層悉行拆出，但展至最後一層爲止，不必全行展出。（未完）</p>

<h3>The Suzuki Brigade of the Japanese Army Stationed in Yushu Retreats; Puppet Organizations in the City Cease Operations</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the withdrawal of the 14th Suzuki Brigade of the Japanese Army stationed in Yuguan, after repeated negotiations between the Receiving Committee and the Japanese side, it was originally scheduled to withdraw completely to Jinzhou by the 6th of this month. Brigade Commander Suzuki originally intended to order the troops to gradually withdraw from the 1st, completing the withdrawal by the 6th. However, due to the rampant banditry in Luandong, the brigade only began boarding trains eastward from Yuguan on the 5th. The brigade headquarters moved to Jinzhou, and its subordinate units should complete their withdrawal by the 6th. In the Yuguan area, only the Luoha garrison team originally stationed there will remain. Most of the puppet organizations in Yuguan city are also rushing to cease operations. Once the closure is completed, the county government can be moved back to Yuguan. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

The combined infantry and artillery of Fang and Ji's forces reached more than 16,000 men. The fighting continued until after 2:00 PM, with the villages of Xiaotangshan on the front lines almost completely burned down. At 3:00 PM, Fang and Ji's main force again reinforced their troops, attacking the left wing of Zhu's division. That regiment retreated due to insufficient strength and moved to its original position in Baishe Town, confronting Fang and Ji's troops. In this battle, Fang and Ji's troops suffered 600-700 casualties, while Zhu's division suffered over 200. After 4:00 PM, the Nationalist army east of Xiaotangshan and Fang and Ji's troops engaged in intense artillery fire, the sound of which reached dozens of miles away. The battle was the fiercest in recent days, and most of the Xiaotangshan market was destroyed by Fang and Ji's artillery fire. Around 7:00 PM, Fang and Ji's main force pressed Zhu's division in Xiaotangshan with renewed force, and the two sides were still engaged in fierce fighting as of 8:30 PM. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 7:00 PM on the 5th, Fang and Ji's troops issued a general attack order, using more than 4,000 troops to press on the artillery battalion of the 129th Division stationed at Mafang Tengpai Camp, bombarding them with mortars throughout the night. At 10:00 PM on the 5th, it was discovered in the Gaoling area that about 300 of Fang and Ji's troops intended to bypass Taipingzhuang and attack Lishui Bridge. The 230th Division discovered this and launched a head-on attack, resulting in fierce fighting. At dawn, the enemy retreated to Gaoling and held its position. As of 9:00 AM, they were still in confrontation. Gaoli Camp is currently defended by Zhao's regiment. Fang and Ji's troops are about 5-6 miles away from Gaoli Camp in the areas of Da and Xiao Dongliu. Last night, small units of Fang and Ji's troops harassed them but were repelled. Zhou Fucheng, the commander of the 129th Division, went to the front lines of Baxianzhuang and Langou this morning to command. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News: Gaoli Camp reports that Fang and Ji's remaining troops intend to disrupt northern Beiping. They were repeatedly intercepted and engaged in fierce fighting by our army in the areas of Da and Xiao Dongliu. The bandits were unable to withstand the attacks and retreated in disarray at dawn. They are now hiding in the mountains about ten miles northwest of Gaoli Camp. Our army has decided on a plan to encircle and annihilate the bandits, and we expect to eliminate them soon. This morning, a Japanese aircraft came to scout the Gaoli Camp area and then flew away. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) It was learned yesterday that Da and Xiao Dongliu, Fenzhuang, and other places near Gaoli Camp were occupied by the remaining forces of Fang and Ji, but they did not dare to occupy Gaoli Camp because Japanese troops were stationed nearby, maintaining strict vigilance. Yesterday afternoon, starting from 4:00 PM, the two armies engaged in fierce fighting again in the areas of Mafang Banzietu, Baimiao, and Baxianzhuang. The sound of gunfire continued throughout the night. Both Beiyuan and outside Andingmen heard the sound of artillery very clearly. Beiyuan was still under martial law as of 6:00 AM this morning, and the sound of gunfire had not subsided much. The two armies are currently confronting each other across the Jiamafang River.

<p>(Beiping) The remaining forces of Fang and Ji are now gathered in Daliushuzhuang, about 2-3 miles north of Mafang. Our army's main position is in Mafang, and we are still pursuing and suppressing them. Because Fang's troops have very few firearms, they often use hand grenades and broadswords to fight, suffering extremely heavy losses. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

Currently, the forward troops of Fang and Ji have broken into Wan's front, and they are being monitored by the left and right wings. We expect to resolve the situation within days. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guan Linzheng's troops were dispatched to Lishui Bridge, Liuwangzhuang, Taipingzhuang, and other areas to establish a strict blockade. The left and right wings of the front lines, Zhou Fucheng and Zhu Hongxun's divisions, established contact with Guan's division, forming an arc-shaped defense line, intending to lure Fang and Ji's troops deep into the hinterland before encircling and eliminating them. Last night, Fang and Ji's troops attacked south, and Wan's two wings firmly defended Tangshan Gaoli Camp. This morning, Fang personally supervised a division to command at Fuxinzhuang, while Ji supervised the battle two miles northwest of Xiaolangou Village. The fighting was extremely fierce from this morning until evening. The artillery fire near Baxianzhuang was extremely intense. Part of Fang and Ji's troops retreated to Dongliu, and most of them remained in Gaoling, still planning to attack south tonight. Fang sent a representative with a personal letter to Wan, hoping to pass through, but Wan replied that he had received orders from the Military Sub-Committee and could not make an exception. The Lishui Bridge area is heavily guarded by Pu Xiaoxian's battalion of Guan's division, and pedestrians are being strictly inspected. (Special dispatch, 6th)</p>

<h3>A Talk to Help Chinese People Understand the Northeast Problem</h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>Recently, Tokyo has again been spreading news of a change in the Sino-Japanese situation. In this news dissemination, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota has further used news agencies to unofficially publish so-called three key points for breaking the deadlock. Reading the phrases "persuading China to recognize the fundamental unity of interests between China and Japan" and "persuading China to recognize the beneficial nature of Chinese politics and economy," I feel that the alluring power they wield is enough to confuse some people within the country's understanding of the Northeast problem. Just as I was thinking of refuting their fallacies, Mr. He came from Liaodong and reported the recent situation in the Northeast to this newspaper. Mr. He studied in France and returned to participate in Deng Tie'mei's volunteer army. Although he failed and came south this time, his conversation was very realistic, different from the heavily propagandistic talks in general, and very helpful to the Chinese people's understanding of the Northeast problem. Here are some excerpts of important questions and answers.</p>
<p>Reporter asked: What is the recent situation of the Northeast Volunteer Army?</p>
<p>Mr. He replied: After the anti-Japanese activities within the Guan were suppressed, the Volunteer Army had no way to operate and could not maintain itself due to the severance of supplies. The various units dispersed and went into hiding, with some resorting to desperate measures to seek food. The Japanese military must use force to eliminate the only organized Volunteer Army, and extremely permissive to those scattered and seeking food, forcing all the Volunteer Army to become bandits and irreconcilable with the residents. Except for a part of Jilin where the popular sentiment is calm, there are few Volunteer Armies that exist in whole units.</p>
<p>Reporter asked: How do the Japanese control the Northeast?</p>
<p>Mr. He replied: The most ruthless means by which the Japanese currently control the Northeast is the control of people's hearts. Now, in all primary and secondary schools, Japanese language must be taught for more than ten hours a week. Every school has a Japanese teacher serving as a supervisor and educator. Starting from primary school, the history taught begins with the Qing Dynasty's entry into China, which is the so-called history of Manchuria. If this continues, it will not be difficult to make the people of the Northeast completely forget their homeland after a few years. In addition, tens of thousands of Korean people oppress the people with the qualification of "old subjugated people," making the people of the Northeast afraid to mention China. Recently, the people of the Northeast have a special mentality. They secretly welcome those coming from within the Guan, using it to inquire whether the government has any news of rescuing them. Some even mistakenly believe that the Japanese aircraft soaring in the sky are Chinese air forces going on an expedition outside the Guan. In the future, after this kind of mentality disappears due to disappointment, the Japanese can declare the psychological control of the Northeast people a success. Mr. He also said that after the truce in North China, Japanese officials believe that those who go to the Northeast from the mainland have no way to operate, and the inspection is not as strict as before. As long as they answer "People of Manchuria" when Japanese officials ask about their nationality, Japanese officials will routinely respond with "Good citizens...Chinese are really bad and want to disturb Manchuria," and shake hands to comfort them in order to win their hearts.</p>
<p>Reporter asked: How is the Japanese immigration to the Northeast progressing?</p>
<p>Mr. He replied: Japanese immigration is only the first step. Most of the more than 800,000 Japanese in the Northeast live in cities such as Shenyang, Changchun, and Harbin. Although there are wooden clogs everywhere in the streets, there are very few Japanese in the countryside. They are threatening and bribing the countryside to relocate a large number of Korean people. These Korean people have the right to force the local people to cultivate rice fields. If the people refuse to be forcibly occupied, the Japanese army will suppress them with force.</p>
<p>Summarizing the words of the above questions and answers, we can get a fundamental understanding, that is, the continuation of the status quo between China and Japan has given Japan the opportunity to calmly carry out its ruling policies. If we take another step back, the anti-Japanese sentiment of the people in the Northeast will disappear completely, and the anti-Japanese forces will be eliminated. Even when there is an opportunity to restore the lost land in the future, it will not be possible to use it. At this time last year, Yosuke Matsuoka was proclaiming that he would make a final calculation of the Manchuria problem in the League of Nations General Assembly in sixty years. Now, this final calculation has been transferred to the Sino-Japanese diplomatic arena. I also reveal two meanings to report to Hirota.</p>
<p>(1) The Chinese people recognize that until the lost land in the Northeast is recovered, the fundamental interests of China and Japan are actually in conflict.</p>
<p>(2) The Chinese people recognize that the Northeast is Chinese territory. If the Northeast is not recovered, the political and economic losses suffered will be too great.</p>

<h3>Japanese Assertion: They Will Exert Power Over the Chinese Eastern Railway; Puppet Ministry of Communications Railway Director Morita Goes to Harbin; Russian Newspapers Report Japanese Military Plans in Puppet Organizations</h3>
<p>(Changchun) Morita, the (puppet) Director of the Railway Department of the Ministry of Communications, departed from Changchun on the morning of the 6th to Harbin, ostensibly to actively resolve the Chinese Eastern Railway dispute. Director Morita (puppet) told reporters regarding policy that the Soviet employees who were reported were due to their violation of [national law]. The North Railway reform that the Ministry of Communications intended was to fairly allocate the main cadre positions between the Russian and Manchu people. If the Soviet Union consistently and stubbornly opposes this, [Manchukuo] will have the necessity to exercise strong power. (6th Dispatch by Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The [Manchukuo] side, on the grounds that the Soviet authorities of the Chinese Eastern Railway are hindering the [Manchukuo]-appointed Acting Chief of the Bureau, Tian, from exercising his duties, has made a serious demand to the Director of the Lude Administration to cease this illegal behavior. If the Soviet side still does not reflect on this, they have resolved to exercise force. (6th Dispatch by Telegram)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Last night, Li Shaogeng, the Supervisor of the Chinese Eastern Railway, made an important statement to reporters, severely attacking the Russian employees of the railway. It is claimed that the Russian employees of the railway seem to continue their strike. The [Manchukuo] authorities have ordered the unsealing of the private office of Gu Bilei, the Russian accountant of the Central Eastern Railway who was arrested the other day, so that the authorities can inspect the accounts managed by Gu. If the Railway Bureau does not comply, the authorities will have to order the police to forcibly unseal it, it is said. Li also said that the responsibility for the current difficulties should be borne by the Russian side. This morning, Li Shaogeng will meet with newspaper reporters again, at which time an important statement may be issued. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Boli The Soviet Consul General in Harbin, Sravtsky, during a meeting with [Manchukuo]'s diplomatic representative in Harbin, Shi Liuming (transliteration), demanded the immediate release of the Soviet officials of the Chinese Eastern Railway who were arrested on false charges and the abolition of the plan to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway. According to news from Harbin, when Sravtsky met with Shi, he pointed out that the indictment against the arrested railway employees has not yet been completed, and it is also unknown under what legal clauses the arrest was based. Sravtsky demanded that the indictment be created immediately and specified what legal clauses the arrested personnel had violated. Shi avoided answering this, only saying that what he hoped would be forgiven was that the examination process was still in progress, so the indictment had not yet been drafted, and the clauses violated could not be stated. He further explained that he could not agree with the essence of this report; he could only apply to the prosecutor to explain. Sravtsky then asked whether the crime committed by the detained personnel was of a personal and private nature or in the capacity of railway employees. Shi could not give any answer to this. Sravtsky then replied to this explanation, saying that his desire to use the requirements of the audit director as the basis for the arrest was a worthless act. At the same time, the prosecutor's interference with the work of the legitimate administrative department of the railway was completely illegal. Sravtsky demanded the immediate release of the arrested personnel, the cessation of fabricating false accusations, and the invention of unfounded crimes, and at the same time abandoning the adventurous and intolerable plan to seize the Chinese Eastern Railway.

<p>(Moscow) It is reported that the railway in northern Korea that connects the ports of northern Korea with the Jihai Railway has been transferred to the management of the South Manchurian Railway. The Zhenli Bao, in its report on this, pointed out the enormous military significance of this move, because the Jihai Railway is a fundamental element of the Japanese military authorities' military plan in Manchuria. The Zhenli Bao further described that Manchuria is simultaneously constructing several railways with military value, and stated that the Japanese General Staff has a tendency to concentrate the entire Manchurian railway administration under the control of the South Manchurian Railway. According to the opinion of the Zhenli Bao, special attention must be paid to this move, because the South Manchurian Railway is a weapon of the Japanese imperialist warlords and fascist group's aggressive policy.

<h3>League of Nations Tightens Expenses: Sends Letters to Countries in Arrears to Urge Payment</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations' budget system will be considered at the next session of the League of Nations Assembly, but currently only 150,000 francs can be saved.

<h3>Assassin of Austrian Prime Minister Confirmed as Fascist: Austrian Prime Minister Has Resumed Duties as Normal</h3>
<p>Vienna The assassin of Prime Minister Dollfuss, Der Dill, has now been proven to be a member of the Austrian National Socialist Party, which was banned months ago. Der Dill has admitted this, but said that he had already left the party six months ago. The assassin did not admit any relationship with the National Socialist Party during the first interrogation. Later, because the evidence was conclusive and there was no way to deny it, he claimed that his relationship with the National Socialist Party was a past fact. The assassin's strategy was to mislead people into thinking that he was acting on his own initiative, not under the direction of a certain group. In addition, the [Evening News] photographed and published the evidence of the assassin joining the National Socialist Party. This evidence was found in the case of the Austrian National Socialist Party. The date on it was November 2, 1932, proving that the assassin had joined the National Socialist Party since January 16, 1932. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Japan's Second Five-Minister Conference: The Civilian and Military Factions Still Confront Each Other; Araki Advocates Tax Increase and Military Expansion; Takahashi Hopes to Strive to Change the Situation; Hirota Adopts Multilateral Cultural Diplomacy</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The second Five-Minister Conference was held in the Prime Minister's official residence starting at 1 p.m. today after the regular cabinet meeting. First, Prime Minister Saito stated his hope that before the specific budget for the next year is compiled, a precise decision must be made on national defense countermeasures, countermeasures against various countries, and the basic tone of foreign policy towards China and Russia. Therefore, he hoped to frankly exchange opinions to investigate national defense and foreign policy. Next, Naval Minister Osumi explained that in preparation for the 1936 Disarmament Conference, he listed the necessary items and explained in detail the content of the second supplementary plan. Later, Army Minister Araki spoke about the current situation in [Manchukuo] and the progress of the Russian industrial plan, and explained the recent Russian tactics on the [Manchu]-Russian border, and also spoke about countermeasures against China's creation of an air force. Foreign Minister Hirota then spoke about changing Sino-Japanese relations and stated his aspirations for foreign policy towards various powers, the United States, and Russia. He further stated that from now on, he would move from economic diplomacy to adopt multilateral cultural diplomacy, and the reasons why it is necessary to establish new embassies abroad and other cultural facilities. At that time, Army Minister Araki and Naval Minister Osumi strongly argued that Japan's international situation must adhere to the principle of national defense first and move forward. However, if this continues the current state of deficit public bonds, it will have to implement tax increases in response to the emergency of the situation to strive for national defense and security. Finance Minister Takahashi opposed this, saying that in the future, through the work of peaceful diplomacy, he hopes to strive to change the situation. As for increasing taxes to raise national defense funds, it will have a significant impact on domestic industries and must be considered. Therefore, the conference failed to reach an agreement and will continue to hold the Five-Minister Conference after the cabinet meeting on the 10th. The meeting adjourned at 4:30 p.m. (6th Dispatch by Telegram)</p>
<h3>Ishii and Fukai Returned to Tokyo Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ishii and Fukai, the Japanese representatives who attended the London Economic Conference, returned to Tokyo this morning. Prime Minister Saito, Foreign Minister Hirota, and others greeted them at the station. Ishii told newspaper reporters his impressions of traveling in Europe, saying that many people in Europe are suffering from commercial depression and deeply hope for a war in the Pacific so that they can seize the markets currently held by Japan and the United States. Ishii also said that Japan and the United States will definitely not go to war. The United States will never repeat the mistake of the Russian fleet being completely annihilated in 1905. Politicians of both countries should not be puppets of others. If Japan and the United States decide not to start a war lightly, both sides have plenty of ways to resolve their outstanding issues, such as mediation and arbitration treaties. Ishii continued to talk about France, saying that many bankers and businessmen in France are currently studying the possibility of investing in Manchuria, and some politicians in France advocate a Franco-Japanese alliance, but this view is not yet widespread. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Ishii's Talk: Avoid a US-Japan War</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Ishii, the plenipotentiary, who arrived at Tokyo Station at 9 a.m. today, spoke to reporters who came to welcome him as follows: At the time when the economic conference broke down, it seemed quite exciting for a while, but it cannot be said that it is difficult to convene such a conference immediately. Moreover, the majority have an air that various countries must cooperate. As for the state of affairs with Japan after the conference was suspended, there have been various theories. However, the conflict between Japan and the United States at this time should really be avoided. If a war breaks out between Japan and the United States, the result may be a world war. Therefore, from this point of view, such as the Japan-US arbitration treaty, etc., in my personal opinion, are very good things. Also, the air towards Japan in Huanzhou is generally good. As for the United Kingdom, although it harbors unfairness in terms of economics, it has old friendships in the overall situation. For example, on the Manchurian issue, although there was criticism from pacifists at the beginning, recently they have gradually understood Japan's position. As for France, because it has a good impression of Japan, so such as the rumored investment in Manchuria, it is only a plan of some capitalists and has no political meaning. Also, the German-Italian alliance has not yet become a reality.</p>
<h3>Fukai's Talk Advocates Economic Liaison</h3>
<p>Fukai's talk is as follows: At the economic conference, the United States seemed to want to decide on an outline at first, but later, due to changes in the situation at the conference, it was disappointed, and all the plenipotentiaries considered the positions of their respective countries and made claims. The economic conference failed because of this. If one insists on the interests of one's own country, whether it is the second or third time, it is impossible to hold a meeting. Moreover, in the future, there is no hope of resolving the issues between countries internationally, and they can only be resolved by special countries through special discussions between the countries concerned. That is, each country implements unique controlled economy, and Japan should also consolidate controlled economy, seek economic liaison with countries with special relationships, and proceed towards the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity.

<h3>Simla Conference Prospects Become Darker</h3>
<p>Simla At the Simla Conference on the 5th, the Japanese imperial representative expressed opposition from the front to the long-planned distribution and export system of the Indian side. Therefore, if it is difficult to discover any compromise point before the next meeting, the Japanese-Indian conference will be temporarily suspended. However, this conference has only just begun, and the enemy quantity issue has not yet been discussed, so it is feared that there will be no progress within this month. Also, if a solution point is not reached within this month, the Indian Provisional Assembly will be convened on the 13th of next month for a session of three weeks, and it will inevitably be suspended during that time. Therefore, the completion of the conference will be at the end of the year at the earliest, or it will be postponed to next year. (6th Dispatch by Telegram)</p>
<h3>Anglo-American War Debt Reopens for Discussion: Expanded Scope Equals Economic Conference; Progress of Reconstruction in Both Countries Not Obstructed</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Anglo-American war debt issue began negotiations at the US Treasury Department this morning. The British representative, Lees-Rose, and the US Undersecretary Atcheson and other representative experts spoke for 30 minutes, adjourned without setting the next meeting date. It is heard that the British representative immediately telegraphed the domestic government after the adjournment, seemingly to discuss the future trend of the talks. It is also heard that the representatives of both sides studied the financial situation of the United States, discussed the international trade situation, the flow of gold among the major financial countries of the world, and other economic events related to British debt repayment. The British representative did not propose a special plan to amend the war debt, but only proposed to study everything that could affect Britain's ability to repay debts and the general financial situation of the United States. It is widely said that the representatives of both sides studied monetary events and gold flows at the first meeting today, indicating that this debt conference will gradually turn into monetary negotiations. Two days ago, a certain US government official predicted that the Anglo-American talks would handle the groundwork for a monetary conference to be held in London in the future. The situation at today's meeting is even more convincing. Accompanying British representative Lees-Rose this morning were British Ambassador Lindsay and British financial expert Pichulei. The fact that the next meeting date was not set before the adjournment shows that the negotiations will proceed slowly so that the British representative can constantly exchange views with the domestic government. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Currently, attention to the war debt issue here has exceeded all other important issues. It was recently heard that the US government consulted well-known bankers here regarding war debt negotiations. The situation at today's meeting seemed that the British representative Lees-Rose, British Ambassador Lindsay, and US Undersecretary Atcheson did not want to discuss the amendment proposal urgently, but were willing to study the economic situation that could affect the war debt in advance. This attitude is also endorsed by most bankers here. According to private telegrams received in Wall Street, Lees-Rose and Atcheson both agreed that the progress that both countries are making in reconstruction should not be obstructed. Therefore, this talk has the most considerate atmosphere for both sides compared to previous war debt talks. Although the Department of Finance has not expressed any news that can verify that it will gradually tend towards stable currency, New York bankers all believe that stable currency will be one of the results. These people still believe that stabilizing the exchange rate between the gold dollar and the gold pound is sufficient to encourage international trade and generate confidence in industry and commerce.

<h3>Germany Submits Answer on Disarmament Issue: Mussolini Drafts New Plan</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The latest development in the disarmament issue is that the German representative has submitted the German answer to the representatives of the UK, France, and Italy. The content is not yet known, but it is known that Germany has made some suggestions regarding the proposal of the UK, France, and Italy to resolve the disarmament issue. It is heard that France is not very satisfied with this answer, but the UK believes that it can be used as a basis for discussion. (6th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Rome Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, in order to reconcile the views of all parties and save the disarmament conference from danger, has drafted a new disarmament plan. This news has now been published in today's Italian People's Newspaper in an essay drafted by Mussolini himself. The article first states the current difficulties of the disarmament conference and the loss of credibility of the League of Nations due to Japan's actions. Mussolini then said that it is not yet time to destroy the medicine, but we must find ways to eliminate mutual distrust and misunderstandings. Mussolini continued, "The so-called [protectors of the peace treaty]" and the countries directly affected by the treaty, the poor feelings between the two sides are indeed undeniable facts, but the dissatisfaction of the defeated countries is indeed justified. They are bound by the peace treaty and disarmed, while the victorious countries are not restricted by the peace treaty, and have not yet fulfilled their obligations despite their vows of equal reduction of troops. Furthermore, now that Germany has obtained the same status, and the Four-Power Pact has also been established, it is extremely difficult to continue to discriminate against Germany in the future, but on the other hand, the special and complex situation of other countries cannot but be taken into consideration. The conclusion of the article is that in order to overcome the above-mentioned difficulties, Mussolini has drafted a new disarmament draft, which will be submitted to various countries within a few days.

<h3>The Long-Standing Franco-German War Cannot Be Resolved: Talk by the Prussian Prime Minister; Germany Does Not Harbor Revenge</h3>
<p>(Paris) Prussian Prime Minister Goering, one of Germany's most famous aviators during the European War, met with a reporter from the Paris Evening News today and said that speaking as a soldier who has been in the army for many years, the Germans really do not want to fight. He also said that France and Germany cannot destroy each other. In the past wars, they have never accomplished this feat, and it will definitely be the same in the future. The year of promoting this kind of bravery is still in our memory, but the disaster is also very terrible. Unless it is for the purpose of revenge, who would want to be subjected to this test again? Now the only legitimate reason for starting a war is that the land is invaded by other countries, or the people are enslaved and humiliated, and the people rise up to resist. Goering concluded that Germany does not harbor revenge. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British Conservative Party Advocates Strengthening National Defense: Annual Meeting Passes Churchill's Proposal</h3>
<p>(London) The Conservative Party held its annual convention in Birmingham today. During the meeting, three issues will cause fierce debate: the German Jewish issue, the national defense issue, and the Indian issue. At the opening today, 20,000 representatives of the party arrived at the meeting. The Indian issue will be discussed tomorrow. The extremists of the party, who support British Imperial Unity, have become increasingly consolidated within the party. Then, all members unanimously passed Churchill's motion, declaring that the procedures established by Britain are insufficient to consolidate the national defense of the Empire. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Yesterday, the Conservative Party's annual convention passed Churchill's motion, advocating that the government should increase the national defense of the British Empire. Today, the Conservative Party's newspaper [Morning Post] commented on this matter, arguing that the strength of the British army and navy has been dwarfed compared to other powerful countries. All attempts to reduce armaments are insane. This is all due to the influence of socialists and internationalists on the cabinet, which has led to this unfortunate fact. The conclusion is that in the great war of 1914, the territories of France and Belgium were occupied, but the suffering suffered by Britain was no less than that of France and Belgium. Therefore, the fallacy of British arms reduction cannot be tolerated in the socialist program, and there is no possibility of a foothold in the national cabinet. Recent events in Europe are sufficient to show that Britain has long made a big mistake. This should make the government and the people guard against past mistakes. This is the historical mission of the Conservative Party. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Today's Daily Mail strongly advocates that Britain should expand its air force so that it can regain its position as an arbiter in world peace. The newspaper therefore opposes the Geneva proposal to reduce the air force, saying that the number of British commercial aircraft has now fallen to fourth place. The United States has over 10,000 aircraft, France has 1,821 aircraft, Germany has 1,200 aircraft, and Soviet Russia is not included. Soviet Russia has between 8,000 and 10,000 commercial aircraft and is adding 100 aircraft every month. (5th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Romania and Turkey Conclude Treaty of Friendship: Balkan Situation Becomes Increasingly Moderate</h3>
<p>Romanian Capital It is officially announced here that Romania and Turkey have concluded a treaty of friendship and arbitration, which will be signed when Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu travels to Ankara, the Turkish capital, this month. The Foreign Minister stated that the content of this treaty is similar to other treaties of friendship and arbitration concluded within the scope of the League of Nations. However, what we should especially pay attention to is that the situation in Southeastern Europe has been becoming increasingly moderate for some time. After the establishment of this treaty, it will be even more moderate, and the negotiations currently underway regarding the Black Sea Convention will also be greatly facilitated.

<h3>Paraguay and Panama Recognize the New Government of Cuba; U.S. Ambassador Offers No Comment</h3>
<p>Havana – This afternoon, the Cuban government formally announced that Uruguay and Panama have recognized the San Martín government. U.S. Ambassador Wells declined to comment on the matter. When asked what attitude the United States might adopt in response, Wells also gave no definitive answer. Upon hearing the news of the two countries' initial recognition, Cubans who support the new government rejoiced and formed a parade, marching through the streets to celebrate. The city of Havana is now more peaceful than it has been since the overthrow of the Cespedes government. (5th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Havana – Opponents of the government are threatening to destroy British industries in Cuba, aiming to force Britain to pressure the United States to intervene in Cuban domestic affairs. Cuban authorities have dispatched troops and police to protect British industries. The storm with winds of eighty-two miles per hour, which sank several small boats in the harbor and injured twenty people, has passed, but looting continues. Soldiers opened fire, killing two looters. However, in the process of expulsion, one soldier from both the army and navy died, and one civilian was injured. (5th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Havana – U.S. Ambassador to Cuba, Welles, met with Colonel Batista, Chief of Staff of the Cuban Army, twice yesterday evening and this morning to discuss the political situation. The Havana branch of the American Legion will hold a meeting on Friday afternoon to discuss the Cuban situation and decide what attitude to take towards future events. This meeting is very important and may influence U.S. policy towards Cuba. Since the National Hotel massacre, the feelings of conservative parties towards the U.S. Ambassador to Cuba have greatly diminished. (5th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Havana – According to reliable sources, a rift has developed between Chief of Staff Colonel Batista and the university student faction. Furthermore, Colonel Batista has met with U.S. Ambassador Welles several times. According to interpretations here, these facts suggest that the Cuban government will soon reach a compromise with the United States, and there is progress in organizing a coalition cabinet. However, the university students consistently oppose a coalition cabinet. The Cuban government believes that although the Nationalists oppose forming a coalition cabinet, inviting their representatives to participate in the cabinet might remove obstacles.

<h3>Tensions Rise Again in Spain; Political and Labor Unrest Loom</h3>
<p>Madrid – Electrical and gas workers in Catalonia have gone on strike. Tonight, the authorities have announced a "prevention status," which is a preliminary step towards declaring martial law. Political turmoil has not subsided, and the entire nation is on edge. The Socialist Party is now demanding a revolution to the end, while the right-wing party, backed by public opinion, advocates dissolving the parliament. The president is in a dilemma. The Lerroux government continues to handle government affairs temporarily until a new cabinet is formed. (Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid – Today, the Spanish President instructed Independent Republican member Laumon to organize a coalition cabinet, thereby dissolving the parliament and holding new elections. In the afternoon, Montchen reported to the President that after consulting with national leaders, he felt it was difficult to form a new government based on the current outline, and therefore requested the appointment of another capable person. The President briefly discussed the matter and then appointed former Royalist Premier Petrocerril to form a cabinet. Petrocerril has tried to do so. (5th National Dispatch)</p>
<p>Madrid – Three days have passed since the cabinet organized by Radical Socialist leader Lerroux resigned. Given the current situation in parliament, it is anticipated by most that no party can form a majority, making it difficult to resolve the political turmoil. As a result, there is a growing number of people advocating the dissolution of parliament. Since Lerroux resigned, President Mora has entrusted the legal expert Lueman to try to form a new cabinet, but Lueman quickly declined. Yesterday, the President again invited Beth, a former member of the reformist cabinet, to form a cabinet, but Beth faced the same difficulties as others and has also given up the idea. The President then invited Dr. Marenon to try to form a new cabinet. Dr. Ma is a famous Republican, and he played a significant role in the overthrow of the Portuguese monarchy. However, since the establishment of the Republic, Ma has rarely been involved in politics, consistently maintaining a neutral stance in various political disputes. Therefore, Ma seems to be the most qualified person to organize a "national reconciliation" cabinet at this time. (6th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Matters Requiring Attention in Preparing Local Budgets</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) At the thirty-third meeting of the Legislative Yuan on the morning of the 6th, the Finance Committee reported that it had examined ten draft general budgets for ordinary revenue and expenditure for the twenty-first year of the Republic from the five provinces of Henan, Anhui, Hubei, Hebei, and Guangxi, the four cities of Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, and Qingdao, and the Weihaiwei Administrative Office, totaling ten cases. They were submitted for discussion at the seventh meeting on September 20th. Considering that China's budget system is newly implemented and local governments face difficulties in implementation, which is an unavoidable reality, it was resolved that the above ten cases should be passed as drafted. However, to improve local budgets in the future, Chen Changheng, Shi Weihuan, and Liu Tong were also nominated to formulate improvement suggestions to be submitted. These suggestions have also been drafted at a meeting and are presented separately. The committee members discussed the results and decided to change the title "Suggestions for Improving Local Budgets" to "Matters Requiring Attention in Preparing Local Budgets" and to revise the articles. The entire assembly passed the changes unanimously. The "Matters Requiring Attention in Preparing Local Budgets" are recorded as follows: 1. All national tax revenues and expenditures must not be included in local budgets. (Explanation) National and local revenues and expenditures have long been divided, and the financial system must not be confused. Therefore, future local budgets should not include national tax revenues and expenditures to clarify the system. 2. Evils such as "false revenue and real expenditure," "real revenue and false expenditure," and "revenue and expenditure mismatch" must be eliminated. (Explanation) To achieve a true match between financial revenues and expenditures and to put local finances on track, all inaccurate or improper revenues and expenditures must not be included in the budget to avoid difficulties in preparing the final accounts. 3. Funds from central government subsidies to local governments or local government assistance to the central government must be listed separately under special items, and the amounts must be consistent with those listed in the national general budget. Central government subsidies to local governments should be allocated directly by the central government. (Explanation) Funds from central government subsidies to local governments are local revenues, and funds from local government assistance to the central government are local expenditures. Therefore, both must be listed separately under special items in each local government's general budget, and the amounts listed must be consistent with those listed in the national general budget to ensure that these funds have a firm legal basis and that the true state of local finances can be understood. 4. The preparation of local budgets must take into account the people's ability to bear the burden. (Explanation) Although current financial policy adopts the principle of "measuring expenditure based on revenue" for budget preparation, it is important to consider the people's ability to bear the burden at a time when the national economy is extremely depleted to avoid exhausting resources and depleting both the public and private sectors. 5. Local governments at all levels must strictly abide by the revised Interim Law on Supervising Local Finance. (Explanation) Currently, provinces and cities sometimes violate the provisions of the Interim Law on Supervising Local Finance when handling local finances, especially Articles 3 to 7, such as changing tax items and tax rates, privately issuing public bonds, and establishing improper taxes. Furthermore, the monthly and annual reporting procedures stipulated in Article 9 have not been earnestly followed. Therefore, they should be ordered to strictly comply to ensure that the central government can effectively supervise local finance. 6. Operating budgets must be prepared separately, and both the estimated and general budgets must be explained in detail. (Explanation) Items of an operating nature in local budgets must be prepared separately as operating budgets to clarify the true situation and cannot simply list the profit and loss in the ordinary budget. Furthermore, local estimated and general budgets must be explained item by item in detail to provide a basis for review. 7. All special revenues must be included in the budget, reported accurately, and audited and written off. Those deemed to conflict with laws and regulations upon review must be abolished on schedule. (Explanation) Improper revenues that conflict with laws and regulations should be strictly ordered to be abolished on schedule. However, if such revenues have not been completely abolished within a fiscal year, this type of revenue and its use should also be included in a separate budget, reported accurately, and audited and written off; otherwise, the true situation will be unclear, and the abuses will be greater. 8. The dates for preparing and submitting the estimated and general budgets must comply with the provisions of laws and regulations. (Explanation) In recent years, the review and publication of local budgets have often been carried out after the end of the fiscal year, which is equivalent to a mere formality, and the legislative body has no way to fulfill its legislative oversight responsibilities. In the future, they should be ordered to prepare and submit estimated and general budgets in accordance with the time periods stipulated by laws and regulations and must not delay. 9. A chapter on the preparation of the budget for the twenty-second year of the Republic should be separately established, and all provinces and cities should be notified to uniformly prepare and submit budgets starting from this year. (Explanation) The twenty-second year of the Republic has already begun three months ago. Before the Budget Law is officially implemented, the Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics should be ordered to quickly draft a chapter on the preparation of the budget for the twenty-second year and submit it to the National Government for promulgation and implementation so that all local governments can start preparing the budget for the twenty-second year as soon as possible. All provinces and cities should be notified to uniformly prepare and submit budgets starting from this year and must not violate the law again. 10. Preparations should be made to implement the Budget Law starting from the twenty-third year of the Republic. (Explanation) The Budget Law was promulgated in September of the twenty-first year and has been in effect for one year. The Directorate General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics should be ordered to make preparations quickly and set a date to implement it starting from the twenty-third year; otherwise, remaining in a wait-and-see attitude would defeat the original intention of the legislation.

<h3>Huang Fu Returns to Beiping; Japanese Representatives Arrive in Succession to Discuss Everything; North China Diplomatic Disputes Will Seek Resolution; Huang Advocates Revitalizing Morale and Working Hard to Move Forward</h3>
<p>— Correspondent</p>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: Huang Fu, who is responsible for the political and diplomatic affairs of North China, previously went south after receiving a telegram to discuss strategies for dealing with the current situation. Now, a considerable result has been achieved, and he has returned to the north to preside over the affairs. In the future, the political and diplomatic affairs of North China will be handled by Huang, and Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations will evolve under the theme of amity and peace. It is learned that Huang arrived in Beiping yesterday (the 4th) at 1:05 PM. Kita Seiichi, a representative of the Kwantung Army, arrived with him. Japanese Ambassador Arima and Kwantung Army Chief of Staff Okamura will also arrive in Beiping within the next two or three days to discuss various issues between China and Japan in North China with Huang Fu in detail. It is reported that after Huang's return to the north, his first priority is to seek the permanent stability of North China and gradually promote its prosperity. The second priority is to quickly resolve all current disputes. There are approximately several aspects to the current disputes: (1) After the war zone was taken over, the security forces were weak, and bandits took the opportunity to rise up, wreaking havoc at will, and threatening to spread like wildfire. In order to stabilize the local area and eliminate bandits, our side sent representatives to consult with the Japanese side to send troops to the front line to clear the countryside. After many days of negotiations, no results were obtained. As a last resort, the security forces permitted in the ceasefire agreement were quickly organized and sent to deal with the emergency. Unexpectedly, when the security forces departed from Luanzhou, they were blocked by the Japanese army on the way and forced to return. The reasons given by the Japanese side were: firstly, that our security forces had long since entered the war zone, and that those dispatched this time were additional; and secondly, that the security forces dispatched this time were reorganized from the army, which violated the agreement. In fact, our security forces, due to incomplete training and the hasty takeover last time, temporarily dispatched a portion to maintain order, and the rest were planned to be dispatched successively after training was completed. The Japanese side's claims were purely a misunderstanding. In recent days, representatives have been sent to Yuguan to negotiate with Kita, the representative of the Japanese army, and Suzuki, the brigade commander, and gradually obtained understanding. Yesterday, Kita arrived in Beiping. Today (the 5th), Huang Fu and He Yingqin hosted a banquet in Jurentang to entertain them. After the banquet, Huang, He, Kita, and Shibata, the military attache of the Japanese embassy, discussed this matter and reached a solution. The security forces will be able to go to eastern Luanzhou within a few days to engage in bandit suppression. (2) The takeover of various passes along the Great Wall has been under negotiation for a long time, but has not yet been resolved. This matter is quite complicated. There are about sixty or more passes, large and small, along the Great Wall. Except for the five major passes of Xifengkou, Gubeikou, Yuguan, Jiumenkou, and Lengkou, the remaining small passes are not currently garrisoned by the Japanese army, and the takeover is relatively easy. However, the takeover of these five major passes is quite difficult, especially Yuguan, which is an important gateway for travel between the three northeastern provinces and the interior. The puppet state has established various institutions there, and even the establishment of a customs office is proving to be extremely difficult. Since Dalian is a free trade port, in the current situation, if our side does not establish a customs office in Yuguan to collect taxes, goods from all countries can enter the interior through Dalian. In this way, not only will North China be greatly affected, but the foreign trade of the entire country will also be hit. As a result, the national tax revenue will also be sharply reduced. However, if a customs office is established in Yuguan, it seems to tacitly acknowledge that this is the boundary, and there is a tendency to tolerate the existence of the puppet organization. This is just one example; there are many other similar problems. Therefore, the takeover of various passes along the Great Wall cannot be done without considerable research and negotiation. (3) Since the troops of Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang entered the war zone, the Japanese side has again used the pretext of military force to drive them out, and they have entered Huairou and other places. At the same time, the troops of Fang and Ji are actively advancing south on the border of the war zone. A solution to this complex situation needs to be found urgently. According to Huang, after returning to Beiping, he is discussing solutions with various parties.</p>
<p>Huang returned to Beiping yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. At 5:00 PM, he met with reporters at Fengzeyuan and issued the following statement: [I (Huang referred to himself) went south in early July and am only now returning north, which has been two months. During these two months, I am ashamed to have accomplished nothing. What I can report is approximately three points: (1) After going south, I reported the situation in North China to the central government and discussed various issues related to the aftermath. The central government has a deep understanding and appreciation of the environment in North China and the various complex situations. (2) The most difficult problem currently facing North China is finance. After consultation with the central government, a considerable solution has been found. It has been decided that the military expenses of North China will be restored to the original budget of 4.5 million yuan, which will be maintained by the central government. The military expenses of North China were originally 4.5 million yuan before the war, and were later increased to 5.7 million yuan due to military reasons. After the war, great efforts were made to reduce them, reducing them to 5 million yuan. Since the central government decided to restore the original budget, the Beiping Military Branch has repeatedly held meetings to reduce expenses, and has now reached a considerable level, which is not much different from what the central government intended. Minister Song believes that if the financial situation in North China remains in its current chaotic state, there is no solution. He advocates that it should be completely under the central government, and find ways to reorganize it, so that it can be saved. I have no preconceived notions about this. It has now been decided that the financial affairs of North China will be completely under the central government, which should be more manageable in the future. (3) Relief for war victims is a major problem in North China. The central government has changed its plans for relief in the war zone several times. The initial plan was to allocate 20 million yuan for relief, but due to various reasons, it was changed to 5 million yuan, of which 1 million yuan was in cash to handle emergency relief, and 4 million yuan was in public bonds to relieve rural areas. The cash has already been remitted before I went south. The public bonds must wait until the regulations are passed before they can be issued. These regulations have long been reported to the central government, but have not yet been passed by the Legislative Yuan. I do not know the reason. Only after going south did I learn that there were some disputes over the public bond fund. It has now been completely resolved. It should be passed this week or next week, and the issuance date is not far away. The above three points are the most important issues that I can report. In addition, I have also participated in the discussion of the overall national problem because it is related to North China, and generally have considerable results. As for personal feelings, I have talked about them when passing through Nanjing, Jinan, and Tianjin. Recalling the day I first arrived in Beiping on May 17th, enemy planes soared over Beiping, and the sound of enemy cannons shook the suburbs. The tension was so great that there was no room for delay. In order to comfort the people of the country, I put forward the slogan of stabilizing people's hearts. Although the situation is now more relaxed, it has not yet reached a stable level. The word "stability" should be changed to "revitalization." In the current difficult environment, there is no other way but to revitalize people's hearts and work hard to move forward. There was a slight misunderstanding between China and Japan regarding the suppression of bandits in eastern Luanzhou. Now, after negotiation, there is complete understanding. The security forces will be able to go there soon to eliminate bandits, which can be expected. The takeover of various passes along the Great Wall is no longer a problem for the small passes. The five major passes are complicated and still require a considerable period of negotiation and research to be resolved.] (October 5th)</p>
<h3>Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang Invade Northern Beiping; Fierce Fighting in the Gaoliying Area; People from Northern Beiping Flee to Beiping for Refuge; Japanese Troops Increasingly Active in the War Zone</h3>
<p>Beiping Special Dispatch: The troops of Fang Zhenwu and Ji Hongchang have repeatedly attacked Changping since the 1st of this month, plotting to cut off the Ping-Sui Railway. On the 3rd, they retreated from the vicinity of Qincheng and Daxiaohongmen in the northeast of Changping to Tangshan Gaoliying. One route attacked Datangshan from Xingshou Qincheng, and the other route passed through Mayu, Yulin Garden, Xiangtun, and other places, and occupied the vicinity of Gaoliying. The troops in Tangshan suddenly occupied Datangshan yesterday (the 4th). This morning (the 5th), a detachment advanced from Pingzhuang towards Xiaotangshan. A certain regiment stationed in Xiaotangshan gathered its forces in Langou, Tangtou Village, Suanzaoling, and other places, and tried its best to defend. At 7:00 AM this morning, Fang Ji's cavalry was also discovered in Mafang, four or five li south of Xiaotangshan. It clashed with the stationed troops. After an hour of contact, Fang Ji's troops retreated slightly. Then, more than 1,000 infantrymen counterattacked, and fierce fighting broke out again. In the afternoon, the fighting subsided somewhat, and the two sides were in a stalemate, with occasional clashes. Yesterday, Fang Ji's troops were also discovered in Dadongliu and Xiaodongliu, west of Gaoliying. The stationed troops were alerted and immediately went to block them. After a day of fierce fighting, Fang Ji's troops finally retreated to Gaoliying, but then used surprise troops to approach Lishui Bridge, south of Gaoliying. Due to strategic reasons, the stationed troops temporarily abandoned Gaoliying and returned to attack. At the same time, the authorities here believed that Lishui Bridge was only more than 30 li away from Beiping, which was of great importance, and sent a large army to reinforce it. Only then were Fang Ji's troops repelled. Today, fierce fighting is still taking place in the vicinity of Gaoliying and Lishui Bridge. The national army is densely deployed north of Lishui Bridge, in Taipingzhuang, Lishuyuan, and in the vicinity of Xiaotangshan, Mafang, and Baxianzhuang, forming a large encirclement. There should be developments within a few days. Wan Fulin personally went to the front line yesterday to make arrangements because the military situation at the front was tight, ordering the divisions of Zhou Fucheng and Zhu Hongxun to coordinate the defense line. The Pingbei Avenue has been cut off again in recent days. The Tangshan telephone line has also been experiencing problems since yesterday. People fleeing to Beiping for refuge are constantly arriving, and the situation is very tragic. The Japanese army has used the pretext of driving out Fang Ji and entered the war zone. Not only have they not withdrawn in recent days, but they have also added more than 700 troops to Miyun, Huairou, and other places. The Fourth Brigade has established its headquarters in a certain salt shop in Miyun City, and Brigade Commander Saeda is stationed there. After the fighting broke out in Gaoliying yesterday, the Fifth Regiment of the Japanese army stationed in Huairou sent more than 50 Japanese soldiers by military vehicle to Xishuiquan Village, about five li north of Gaoliying, at 10:00 AM this morning. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, more than 100 more arrived, claiming to prevent Fang Ji's troops from retreating into the war zone. Japanese planes have been constantly scouting and dropping bombs in recent days. This morning, a Japanese plane flew to the Gaoliying area and dropped three bombs west of Gaoliying.

<h3>General Situation of the Jiangbian-Lanxi Section</h3>
<p>The entire section is 200 kilometers long. From the date of the first survey of the Jiangzuo line in the 17th year of the Republic to the date of the completion of the entire project in May of the 22nd year of the Republic, it cost a total of 6,623,903.29 yuan. In June of the 20th year of the Republic, traffic was opened from Jiangbian to Jianshan. In July, traffic was opened to Zhuji. In December, traffic was opened to Yiwu. By February of the 21st year of the Republic, traffic was opened to Jinhua. In March, traffic was opened to Lanxi. There are a total of 21 stations. All station buildings, platforms, fences, and temporary water supply equipment along the line were completed in the 20th year of the Republic. A machine factory was also established in Xixing. There are now nine locomotives, thirty passenger cars, and eighty freight cars, which are sufficient for current use. Initially, passenger cars traveled back and forth daily, with one mixed train running each way. Subsequently, one express train and one local train were added each way daily. After traffic was opened to Lanxi, two express trains and two local trains ran each way daily. In terms of business, when traffic was opened to Jianshan in the 20th year of the Republic, monthly passenger and freight revenue was approximately 15,000 yuan. When traffic was opened to Yiwu, monthly revenue increased to more than 28,000 yuan. After traffic was opened to Jinhua and Lanxi, monthly revenue increased from 54,000 yuan to 100,000 yuan. Passenger traffic was even busier at the end of the year, reaching 130,000 to 140,000 yuan per month. In October of the 21st year of the Republic, through transport with the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway was implemented, making travel more convenient.</p>
<h3>The Jin-Yu Section Will Soon Be Completed</h3>
<p>The Jin-Yu section, from Jinhua to Yushan Bingxi, is 164 kilometers long and requires approximately 6 million yuan. Besides the authorities raising 1 million yuan in cash and borrowing 200,000 pounds from the Boxer Indemnity fund to purchase materials (approximately 3.5 million yuan in national currency), another 2.5 million yuan was borrowed from a banking consortium of four banks including the Bank of China in Hangzhou. In the winter of the 21st year [of the Republic], the entire section was re-surveyed. The roadbed officially commenced construction on November 21 of the same year. The roadbed width is 4.0 meters, the track gauge is 1.435 meters, and it is a single track. The earth and stone volume of the roadbed is 3,182,000 cubic meters, divided into eight sections, contracted by the Far East Consortium and the China Industrial Development Company. Major bridges include the Jinhua River, Qingyang, Houda Creek, Xinban Creek, Zhu Creek, Mabaoxia Mountain Creek, Lingshan Port, Shangshan Creek, Dongji River, Jiangshan River, and Dukou Bridges, totaling 1605 meters. Minor bridge construction is 382 meters, culverts are 355, telephone and telegraph lines are 164 kilometers, and tracks are 174 kilometers. The entire section will have fourteen stations. The first phase will add six locomotives, 24 passenger cars, and 40 freight cars. Most bridges are of a permanent nature. Station buildings, water supply, and other facilities are temporary. All projects are scheduled to be completed by the end of the 22nd year [of the Republic]. The section from Jinhua to Tangxi was opened to traffic on September 11. Construction between Tangxi and Longyou is actively underway, and the entire line is expected to be open to traffic by the end of the year.</p>
<h3>Installation of Telephone Lines</h3>
<p>The long-distance telephone service in Zhejiang Province was planned and prepared in the 17th year [of the Republic]. The Hangzhou City telephone service was also taken back and managed by the province in the winter of the 18th year [of the Republic], planning the establishment of automatic telephones. The effectiveness of wireless telephones throughout the province is especially great and is also described here.</p>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephones</h3>
<p>Up to the 18th year [of the Republic], the main lines of Hangzhou-Fengqiao, Fengqiao-Shanghai, Hangzhou-Changxing, Hangzhou-Changshan, Hangzhou-Pinghu, and Hangzhou-Qingyuan, totaling more than 2,750 li, have been completed. After the 19th year [of the Republic], there was even greater progress. The main long-distance lines were either completed or had long-distance lines added, and rural branch lines were installed. In the 19th year [of the Republic], more than 1,736 li of telephone lines were completed, in the 20th year [of the Republic], 1,517 li were completed, and in the 21st year [of the Republic], the provincial-county cooperation method was adopted, and progress was smoother. A total of 2,045 li of telephone lines were completed, including 345.5 li of vehicle telephone lines built along with highways, and 210.5 li of branch lines under construction, with 1,489 li of actual lines built. In three years, a total of 4,742 li of lines were built, and together with the previous two years, a total of 8,165 li of lines were built. A total of 58 counties throughout the province have telephone service. There are currently seven branch bureaus (Jiaxing, Wuxing, Ningbo, Lanxi, Linhai, Shuijia, and Lishui), nineteen first-class branch bureaus, twenty-four second-class branch bureaus, and over one hundred acting offices.</p>
<h3>Automatic Telephones</h3>
<p>The original telephone system in Hangzhou City had outdated equipment, chaotic wiring, and was limited by the capacity of the original switchboard, failing to meet the needs of the city. After being taken back and managed by the province in the winter of the 18th year [of the Republic], the planning for automatic telephones began immediately. A rotary automatic exchange with 3,000 lines was selected. In June of the 20th year [of the Republic], the city's main exchange building was completed, and in November, the Gongchen Bridge sub-exchange building was completed. Machines were installed, underground cables were completed, and users' telephones were modified. In April of the 21st year [of the Republic], the entire project was completed and telephone service began.</p>
<h3>Wireless Telephones</h3>
<p>In the spring of the 17th year [of the Republic], preparations began for a broadcasting radio station. At that time, the power of the transmitter was only 250 watts. Afterwards, it increased annually, reaching 1,000 watts in the winter of the 20th year [of the Republic]. All 75 counties in the province are equipped with radios. In the summer of the 19th year [of the Republic], to strengthen defense, a telegraph station was added to the radio station. Branch stations were established in the four remote counties of Pingyang, Taishun, Qingyuan, and Longquan. Last year, branch stations were also established in Shipu, Yongjia, and Zhenhai. In addition to communicating with the branch stations, the main station also communicates with radio stations in Beijing, Shanghai, Fuzhou, Hekouzhen, Zhenjiang, Luoyang, Beiping, and Guangzhou at fixed times. Recently, a cooperative method of wired and wireless electricity has been established, using Longquan as the center, which has a great effect. In total, the 32 counties in the province far from the province and without power plants use Model 18 machines, the 40 counties near the province or with power plants use Model 16 machines, 2 counties use Milo machines, and 1 county uses an AC motor.</p>
<h3>Kunshan: Change of the County Public Security Bureau Chief</h3>
<p>Since Qin Jieren, the chief of the Kunshan County Public Security Bureau, was promoted to county chief of Suining, the vacant position has been concurrently held by County Chief Cheng Ruji under provincial order for many months. It is now learned that the provincial order has appointed Hua Shijun, a local resident, as the chief of the county Public Security Bureau. Hua is currently the chief of the First Branch Bureau of Public Security in this county. After receiving the order, he is scheduled to report to the bureau on the 6th and take the oath of office on a set date.</p>
<h3>Chongming: Organization of Disaster Relief Corps in Xideyi Village, Fourth District</h3>
<p>When the hurricane struck the river mouth, Chongming was the first to bear the brunt. On the third day of the eighth month of the Yisi year of the Guangxu reign [1905], the tidal wave at the end of the great flood had already caused a major disaster. This year, both tidal waves occurred at the beginning of the great flood. The coastal embankments have been repeatedly eroded by waves and suffered heavier damage. The destruction of houses and agricultural products is even more difficult to count. Thanks to the benevolent gentlemen at sea and various charitable organizations who have raised donations and provided food to help our compatriots. Their benevolence is truly admirable. However, it is important to remember that emergency relief can only alleviate hunger and cold for a short time, and a fundamental plan is needed for repairing embankments. The technical director of the county government estimates that the cost of construction around the perimeter is more than 500,000 yuan. After this major disaster, the people's strength is definitely not enough to bear it. The Maritime Relief Association has been established, calling out loudly, and there will surely be a response. However, even if a large sum of money is raised, it must be allocated to various counties and cannot be exclusively used for Chongming. The scale of the project is so large, and the money is so difficult to obtain. Thinking about the future, I cannot help but shudder. Qingmu returned home yesterday, and the villagers eagerly asked how to deal with the aftermath. He told them that the current emergency relief, in addition to the county relief association, relies on the continuous supply from the Sino-Foreign Relief Association. Although there is no certainty about raising funds for work relief, it must be done, like resisting the enemy, with no retreat. The elders were pleased and comforted when they heard this, and took the opportunity to propose organizing a disaster relief corps within the scope of Deyi Village, selecting 200 able-bodied men to assist in the construction of embankments along the north and south coasts. All expenses will be raised by the village itself. After discussion, everyone agreed. If the areas in Chongming that have not been affected by the tidal surge are divided into 30 groups, 6,000 people can be obtained, which would be of some help to the progress of the embankment project. This is what is meant by Chongming people helping Chongming people, and Chongming people assisting Chongming people. Only with this spirit of self-help and mutual assistance will we not fail the great philanthropists at home and abroad who are saving and helping us. Qingmu has more to say: land is immovable property, but Chongming is constantly eroding, making it no different from movable property. Therefore, embankment construction must ensure prevention of erosion to achieve consolidation. Qingmu has suggested full-scale erosion prevention and has petitioned the county government. He hopes that the elders and brothers will pay attention to this.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Policeman Flees with a Gun</h3>
<p>The area under the jurisdiction of the Second Branch Bureau of Public Security in this county, which covers the main roads, is of important location. At about 2:00 AM the day before yesterday, the police chief Zheng Yaoqing of the bureau went out to check the posts as usual. To his surprise, he could not find the on-duty auxiliary policeman Zhao Jian at the post in front of Qitai Inn. He searched the surrounding area, but there was no trace. He then found a uniform worn by Zhao Jian and a wooden gun case in the sentry box. However, the insignia on the uniform had been torn off. Police Chief Zheng knew that the policeman had fled with the gun, and immediately reported to Wang Xiezhong, the chief of the branch bureau. After receiving the report, Wang sent patrol officers in different directions to search the roads, hotels, stations, and wharves, but to no avail. Yesterday, Chief Wang reported the information to the head bureau. Director Wu of the bureau sent Second Section Chief Cheng Du along with Wang Xiezhong to the Second Branch Bureau for a detailed investigation. It was found that two wooden gun cases and one pistol were missing from the armory. At 1:00 PM, Chief Cheng, accompanied by Wang Xiezhong and Sun Zhongjie, an official of the branch bureau, returned to the bureau to report. Director Wu kept Wang and Sun at the bureau for questioning and appointed Chief Cheng to temporarily take over the duties of the Second Branch Bureau. According to Wang Xiezhong, the guns had been missing from the armory for three days, but he had not reported it because he was in the process of investigation. The armory is next to the employees' room. The police officer in charge of the armory is Yu Wenhao, who has been serving for many years and also handles telephone duties on weekdays, and sleeps in the telephone room at night. The armory is only locked and not guarded, so no one knows how the guns were stolen. He also requested punishment. Director Wu then summoned police chief Zheng Yaoqing and Yu Wenhao, the police officer in charge of the armory, to the bureau and had them guarded by the special service squad. It was also discovered that the escaped policeman Zhao Jian had sent a package to the home of Qiao Liu at the Laohu Zao in Zhongzheng Road the day before yesterday afternoon. Therefore, the police were dispatched to search Qiao's house and found the package. Six suspects, including Qiao Liu, Qiao Shoulang, Xu Xiaoguizi, Bai San, Wu Xu, and Qiu Shunzao, were brought to the bureau for interrogation. It is also reported that Zhao Jian is from Jiading, 28 years old, and had just started working at the bureau two weeks ago after being introduced by Official Sun, who also acted as his guarantor.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Three Counties Urge Zhang Xianyi to Stay</h3>
<p>Zhang Xianyi, the chief of the Fourth District of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police, was recently ordered to wait for reassignment before the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and Chi Yaozhong was appointed to succeed him. The party, government, business, and public organizations in the counties of Tong, Ru, and Hai, appreciating his service, have sent urgent telegrams to the provincial government and departments to urge his retention. Excerpts from several telegrams are listed below.</p>
<p>Telegram from the Nantong County Fishermen's Association to the Zhenjiang branch and the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government: "Our district's maritime bandits rely on Chief Zhang of the Fourth District of the Provincial Public Security Bureau for effective suppression and are loved by the people. This time, the maritime bandit leader Jiang Si was captured, and the ships and loot were recovered, which is heartening. We have heard of his transfer and feel as if we have been deprived of our parents. We are willing to have him sit in town to deter the bandits. Please withdraw the order. We await your command."</p>
<p>Telegram from the Nantong County Party Headquarters: "Since Chief Zhang Xianyi of the Fourth District of the Water Police took office, he has been effective in defense and suppression, and the security of the waterways is deeply reliant on him. We are alarmed by the news of his replacement, and the public is bewildered. We hereby urgently request the withdrawal of the order to comply with public opinion."</p>
<p>Telegram from the Public Organizations of Rugao: "Since Chief Zhang of the Fourth District of the Water Police took office, he has disciplined the army and led his subordinates. The territory is peaceful and the people are safe. We are horrified to hear of his transfer. Please withdraw the order to reassure the people."</p>
<p>Telegram from the Nantong County Chamber of Commerce: "Since Chief Zhang of the Fourth District of the Water Police took office, he has strictly suppressed maritime bandits, and the banditry has been slightly quelled. Chief Zhang is upright, brave, strict, and fair. He is attentive to the order and defense of the waterways. The people of all counties love and support him. We are alarmed by the news of his transfer. We hereby urgently request commendation to encourage others."</p>
<p>Telegram from the Public Organizations of Haimen: "Since Chief Zhang of the Fourth District of the Water Police took office, he has spared no effort in reorganizing the defenses. Especially in the suppression of maritime bandits, he has personally faced dangers, so that the bandit nests in the Daan and Lingdian ports along the coast of our county, which have existed for many years, have been cleared once and for all, and the locality has been peaceful. We are alarmed by the news of his transfer to the province. Please comply with public opinion and quickly withdraw the order. We await your command."</p>

<h3>The New Municipal Building in the City Center: Completion Ceremony to Be Held on Double Tenth Festival; Grand Ceremony Followed by Mayor Wu's Military Review; City Government Decides to Move to New Location on New Year's Day Next Year</h3>
<p>The new municipal building of the Shanghai Municipal Government in the city center has been completed and is scheduled to hold its completion ceremony at 10:00 AM on the Double Tenth Festival [October 10th]. The municipal government will move in on New Year's Day next year. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>The New Municipal Building</h3>
<p>The municipal government is located in the center of the city, between Fudongnei Road and Fuxinei Road. The entire project and interior decoration have been completed. The architectural model of the municipal government is an ancient palace. The lower level has four doors, and the circular beams can be followed.</p>
<p>Follow it straight up to the second floor. The stone steps on the left and right hang down like ribbons, with the city flower and the three characters of the Municipal Government engraved in the middle. Below the ring-shaped cave is the entrance to the ground floor. An elevator is installed here. The entire building is golden yellow, interspersed with red and green. The colors are elegant, quiet, and solemn, giving it a distinctly antique flavor. The painted buildings soar, the eaves are high and extended, beautiful and magnificent, and extremely spectacular. Entering the room and ascending the hall, the interior layout is seen, which incorporates the advantages of both Chinese and Western styles. The window frames and doors use Western styles, while the carved beams and painted walls are purely ancient Chinese rules. The auditorium on the third floor is particularly colorful, with a green painted ceiling, grand and gorgeous. The mayor's office is on the east side of the auditorium, and the secretary-general's office is on the west side. The rest are the secretariat and office of various departments on the second floor. The lower level has a reception room, a conference room, and a cafeteria. The top floor is used as a storage room and a rest room for the police. Below the front eaves, a firm plaque bears the words "Municipal Government." The surroundings have observation decks. The outer circle of the new building is surrounded by grass, which has also been completely arranged, with green grass and small flowers interspersed with flower beds. In front of the gate of the municipal government, flagpoles stand tall on the left and right, ready for hanging the party and national flags. The square corner lights along the road are silver with gold-yellow copper edges, which complement the color scheme of the new municipal building and are also extremely spectacular. Behind the new building, only separated by a road, is the bronze statue of Sun Yat-sen. The base has been completed. If it can be rushed, it will be moved there on the 10th. Behind it is the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, which has begun the foundation filling. The two municipal museums and libraries that the municipal government is currently building will be located on the left and right sides of the memorial hall in the future.</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of the Bureaus</h3>
<p>The office buildings of the bureaus are the same as the original architectural plan of the new municipal building, but on a smaller scale. Due to the impact of the January 28th Incident [Shanghai Incident], financial constraints, and the lack of time, temporary office buildings were built for the bureaus. They have now all been completed. The Bureau of Land and the Bureau of Public Works are combined into one office, located to the east of the government. The Bureau of Social Affairs, Education, and Health are in one office, located to the west of the municipal government. The Bureau of Finance and the Bureau of Public Utilities are temporarily located in the new municipal building. They will be moved after the new buildings of the bureaus are built. The Public Security Bureau is still located in the Nanshi area and will be moved to the old site of the Shanghai County Government on January 1st next year when the bureaus are relocated. As for the police affairs in the city center, a new office of the Second Sub-Bureau of the Seventh District of the Public Security Bureau has been built on Qimei Road, which is larger than other police stations. After the municipal government moves in in the future, police forces will be expanded to maintain the security of the city center.</p>

This hypothetical five-story building is built in front of the new municipal building.</p>
<h3>Aviation Administration Cables: Nine Aircraft Will Fly Around the City on the Double Tenth Festival to Promote National Attention to Aviation; All Shanghai Aircraft Arrived in Shanghai on the 9th</h3>
<p>The Chinese Aviation Association received a reply from Xu Peigen, director of the Hangzhou Aviation Administration, stating, "Aviation Association: Approved your letter requesting to send aircraft to Shanghai to distribute leaflets. Now, to encourage public enthusiasm for aviation, the Aviation Administration has specially dispatched all Shanghai aircraft, including Shanghai, Shanghai Business, Shanghai School, Shanghai Shang, Shanghai Boy Scouts, and Ningbo No. 6 aircraft, as well as Zhejiang Salvation and two training aircraft to Shanghai. The aircraft will arrive in Shanghai on the 9th at Hongqiao Airport. They will take off from there the next morning and fly around the entire city. Welcome all circles to visit. Please inform the entire city. Xu Peigen, respectfully."</p>
<h3>Song Ziwen Discusses: Customs Bonds to Repay Old Debts; Chen Guangfu Appointed Chairman of Cotton Control Association; National Economic Council to Set Up Office in Shanghai</h3>
<p>After returning to Shanghai from the Finance Department office on West Yanan Road yesterday morning with League of Nations Commissioner Rajchman, Finance Minister Song Ziwen met with reporters from various newspapers at 10:00 AM yesterday morning and strongly denied the rumor that 100 million yuan of new customs bonds would be used to borrow 50 million yuan from the banking community first. Song's remarks are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Bond Lending is Incorrect</h3>
<p>Song said first, "The rumor that the Ministry of Finance's issuance of 100 million yuan of customs bonds will be used to borrow 50 million yuan from the banking community is not true. These bonds will be used entirely to repay arrears and have been negotiated in advance. In the past five or six months, the Ministry of Finance has borrowed more than 60 million yuan from the banking community. Most of these loans are temporary. At this time, we must first repay these debts."</p>
<h3>Strive for Balanced Revenue and Expenditure</h3>
<p>Although the central government's finances are currently extremely tight, we are trying to find a way to overcome this difficulty. The first issue is to ensure that revenue and expenditure are balanced. For military spending, for example, in North China it has been reduced from more than 7 million yuan to 4.5 million yuan. In the future, central military spending will also have to be reduced. However, the central armies are currently working hard to suppress bandits. In fact, this is not yet possible.</p>
<h3>Cotton Association to be Established Soon</h3>
<p>The Cotton Control Association of the National Economic Council is now ready and can be established within days. The committee will consist of about a dozen people. Chen Guangfu, Tang Xinghai, Li Shengbo, Zou Bingwen, Xie Qi, and others have been hired. Chen will be the director. The remaining committee members are still being sought. In the future, all expenses will be allocated by the government to the greatest extent.</p>
<h3>Various Associations Organized Step by Step</h3>
<p>The organization of other committees such as silk, mining, and food will also not be delayed and will be carried out step by step. The government intends to hire people with extensive experience in each industry to serve as the heads of these associations, while the government will assist from the sidelines as a backing. However, the government will be particularly cautious about all personnel matters to avoid being manipulated.</p>
<h3>Office to be Established in Shanghai</h3>
<p>For the convenience of handling matters, the National Economic Council has decided to set up an office in Shanghai and is currently looking for a building. Once it is selected, it can be established. The Engineering Office of the National Economic Council will be renamed the Water Conservancy Office and will be moved to Nanjing soon. The promotion of American cotton and American wheat will still be managed by the Office for Purchasing American Cotton and Wheat, which is affiliated with the Central Bank. Rajchman is the League of Nations' special liaison for technical cooperation in China and is under the National Economic Council, supervising the technical personnel sent to China by the League of Nations. There are more technical personnel coming to China after Rajchman. The League of Nations will be notified to send them again depending on the need for technical personnel. There is no need for Rajchman to set up an office himself.</p>
<h3>Reciprocal Tariffs Not Detailed</h3>
<p>When reporters asked Song about reports that Japan wanted to use reciprocal tariffs as a condition for abolishing consular jurisdiction in China, Song replied, "I have only seen it in the newspapers and do not know the details. I am afraid it is just talk, or it may be a propaganda effort on their part."</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu's Injury Slightly Recovered, Immediately Resumes Duties</h3>
<p>Since Mayor Wu was injured in the waist in a car accident some days ago, he has been treated by the director of the Municipal Health Bureau, Li Tingan, in consultation with doctors Niu Huisheng and Bu Mei, using electrical therapy. He has recovered slightly and immediately resumed his duties. Doctors Niu and others will continue to treat him.</p>
<h3>The Flour Industry Association Discussed Relief Measures Yesterday, and the Flour Exchange Suspended Trading Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Flour Mill Association of this city, in view of the gradual decline of the domestic flour industry and the recent downturn that threatens to shut down all flour mills in Shanghai, held a public meeting at the Banking Club yesterday at 5:00 PM. Representatives from Fuxin, Fufeng, Huafeng, Xinda Xiang, Xin Zhonghua, Shenda, and other mills, totaling more than ten people, attended. Gu Xin-yi was elected as chairman. The chairman gave a report, stating that the flour mill industry has been declining in recent years, reaching an extreme point, hence the convening of the meeting to discuss relief strategies. Representatives from various mills then described the sluggish sales of flour and the daily decline in flour prices, with the selling price per bag not covering costs, especially for lower-grade flour, which had no sales at all. Since the loss of Northeast China, a major sales area for flour, the flour mill industry has suffered a major blow. Furthermore, Tianjin has been flooded with foreign flour, and foreign flour transactions have continued recently. Although the Chinese government has increased import taxes by more than one dime per bag, it is regrettably too light. With the recent depreciation of foreign exchange rates, this small tax is not enough to deter dumping. Therefore, sales in the Beiyang gang (Tianjin gang) cannot be restored, while the Nanyang gang, such as Fuzhou and Xiamen, are plagued by soldiers and bandits, and merchants dare not purchase and transport goods. The exchange market is deserted by long positions, causing the market to decline further. Therefore, it is necessary to gradually suspend work as a passive relief measure. Subsequently, six resolutions were passed: (1) The import tariff on foreign flour should be increased by another one to five dimes, as Japan's import tax on foreign flour is about one yuan, and the import tax on Little Luzon is about five dimes. (2) Please allocate 10 million yuan from the cotton and wheat loan, lend it out at a low interest rate, and repay it in installments. (3) Please organize a national food control committee through the National Economic Council as soon as possible. (4) Small-scale mechanized flour mills in the interior should be subject to the same unified tax as the factories. (5) Reduce flour transportation costs. (6) National military supplies should purchase flour from various factories as much as possible to reduce inventory.</p>
<p>In addition, the Shanghai Flour Exchange suddenly suspended trading yesterday. Due to the daily decline of the flour industry, the price of flour has fallen sharply, requiring short positions to increase margin calls. The amount to be added reached more than 300,000 yuan, but only more than 100,000 yuan has been added, with a large portion still unpaid. Therefore, trading was suspended. If the margin call is not fully paid today, trading will be suspended again.</p>
<h3>Record of Contemporary Figures' Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Yu Youren, Chen Shaokuan, Chuan Rulin, and Liu Weizhi took the night train from Beijing to Shanghai last night and are expected to arrive this morning.</p>
<p>Japanese Minister Ariyoshi Akira will take the night train to Beijing on the 8th.</p>
<h3>American and Japanese Warships Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>The U.S. Asiatic Fleet, which had sailed to Qingdao and the Bohai area to escape the summer heat, has now been redeployed to Shanghai. It arrived in Shanghai at 4:30 PM yesterday, including the submarine tender Canopus, the gunboat Pigeon, and six submarines: 27, 36, 38, 39, 41, and 40. They all sailed into the Huangpu River after 5:00 PM. After the destroyers in North China arrive in Shanghai today, a date will be set to sail to Little Luzon. The 27th Destroyer Division of the Japanese Third Fleet, including the destroyers Ashi, Dong, Fuji, the gunboat Katata, and the cruiser Tenryu, a total of ten ships, have been conducting large-scale maneuvers off the coast of Zhapu since the 4th, inspected by General Yamamoto. The inspection was completed yesterday, and they sailed back to Shanghai together at 1:00 PM, still anchored at Yangshupu. The Myoko battleship, on which Yamamoto was aboard, also entered the port at noon. Starting today, Japanese residents will be publicly invited to board the ships for a visit.</p>

<h3>Shipping Merchants Held a General Meeting Yesterday, Requesting That Water-Land Intermodal Transport Include Private Ships</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Railways and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) signed a national railway-water intermodal transport contract. Before the contract was signed, Yu Qiaqing of the Sanbei Company telegraphed the ministry, requesting that the operating rights of private shipping lines be taken into consideration. The Ministry of Railways replied that the intermodal transport contract signed by the Railway Administration and the CMSNC was also a preliminary trial measure. Later, Yu sent another telegram, arguing that intermodal transport should not be exclusive to one company and that the establishment of the program should be carefully considered, taking all factors into account to ensure fairness. After this telegram was sent, a reply was received from the ministry, stating that it was difficult to comply with the inclusion of private shipping companies in intermodal transport. Upon receiving this news, Shanghai shipping merchants rose up in opposition, arguing that the transportation of state-owned railways being exclusive to CMSNC would leave other shipping companies with no business. Therefore, yesterday at 3:00 PM, the Shanghai Shipping Association convened an emergency general meeting of all private shipping companies at No. 10 Guangdong Road, where each company sent responsible representatives to discuss breaking the monopoly of water-land intermodal transport and fighting for inclusion, in order to determine a course of action. Around 3:00 PM, representatives from various shipping companies (excluding CMSNC) arrived at the meeting one after another. Yu Qiaqing, Chen Bogang, and representative Le Zhenbao, and other members of the executive committee of the Shanghai Shipping Association first discussed many precedents. Then, they proposed that the railway-water intermodal transport contract signed by the Ministry of Railways and the CMSNC for all national railway lines, especially the freight transport of the Longhai Railway, was particularly important. Once implemented, companies such as Dazhen and Hezhong would have no cargo to transport. They discussed this for a long time, generally agreeing that the opposition of private shipping companies to the intermodal transport contract signed by the Ministry of Railways was not against CMSNC monopolizing the profits, but rather against the Ministry of Railways not taking into account the majority of shipping companies and rashly assigning the freight transport of all national railway lines to one company. Regardless of whether CMSNC's tonnage was insufficient</p>
<p>to meet the demand, it was unfair to deprive the majority of shipping companies of the same treatment of state-owned railway transportation. The entire body unanimously decided to petition the Ministry of Railways again, requesting that private merchant ships be included in the water-land intermodal transport contract and that no single company should monopolize it. After the decision was made, the shipping association drafted a document in the name of all shipping companies, strongly protesting to the Ministry of Railways.</p>
<h3>News of the Electrical Workers' Strike Yesterday, Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Issued a Declaration Yesterday</h3>
<p>Regarding the strike by workers at the Shanghai Power Company, workers in various departments continued to slow down work, and some left the factory. A reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency made separate investigations at various locations yesterday and was given a statement by the vice president and general manager of the Power Company, Mr. Xierde, as follows:</p>
<h3>For the Pension Fund</h3>
<p>Mr. Xierde told the reporter from the Xinsheng News Agency that the workers at the new factory of the Shanghai Power Company on Dongting Road, in protest against the company's dismissal of three workers, slowed down work on the morning of the 29th of last month. On the 2nd of this month, they joined the workers at the old factory on Feilun Road and left the factory to strike at the same time. The day before yesterday, temporary workers at the new factory and foremen at the old factory also joined the strike. Because the company refused to pay the pension, 1,400 striking workers from the new and old factories continued their strike yesterday. The remaining 1,100 people, such as the staff in the office and the electricity generation workers in the new and old factories, continued to work as usual.</p>
<h3>Handling According to Contract</h3>
<p>He also stated that of the three workers dismissed, two had been of bad character and one had been at fault and had voluntarily resigned. According to the contract signed between the company and the Municipal Council, they could not be paid. Moreover, since the company was not at fault, it could not violate its established regulations in order to meet the workers' additional demands. It was found that the strike by the workers at the two factories was instigated by others, and the labor side's claim that the company sent police to prevent workers from entering and leaving was purely fabricated.</p>
<h3>Unfavorable Temptation</h3>
<p>According to reports, the Power Company has always treated the labor union very well. However, due to the instigation of unscrupulous elements, many good workers were intimidated and unable to work. The company regrets this. There are many good workers working in the factory who have asked the company to ask the police for protection and to live and eat in the factory for fear of disturbance by the striking workers. This shows that the workers' intentions are not unified.</p>
<h3>Power Generation Unhindered</h3>
<p>The reporter also asked what the company would do if the power generation workers and staff joined the strike. According to the reply, this had not been heard before. However, as a public utility, for the sake of serving society, if it came to this point, the company would definitely hire other workers to replace them. Moreover, Shanghai relies entirely on electricity for factories such as electrical machinery factories and flour mills. For the convenience of business and the needs of all sectors, even if all three shifts of workers went on strike, the company would definitely recruit workers to keep the electricity flowing. Therefore, power generation will not be a problem. As for the striking workers, if they want to enter the factory to work, the company will still allow them to continue to serve. The line cutters who have returned to work are actually workers who voluntarily came to the factory to work.</p>
<h3>Foremen's Meeting</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs attached great importance to this case and had sent personnel to mediate with the Municipal Party Department several times without success. Fearing that the situation would further escalate, they sent a special report to the Municipal Government yesterday to request a review and handling so that the dispute could be resolved as soon as possible. In addition, the Water and Electricity Workers' Union of the Fourth District, because the workers have been away from the factory for many days and the problem has not been resolved, decided to hold a foremen's meeting at 3:00 PM on the 8th to discuss countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Declaration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce issued a declaration regarding the Shanghai Power Company's dismissal of workers and the capital side's failure to comply with government regulations and mediation, which has led to the expansion of the situation and hindered public utilities. The Chamber of Commerce, taking a fair stance, issued a special declaration stating that the Shanghai Power Company had repeatedly experienced disputes over the dismissal of workers such as Ni Genfu and the payment of pension funds. The Party Department and the Chinese directors of the Municipal Council had mediated several times without success. On September 27, the company suddenly dismissed Xue A'bao, Dai Renheng, Yin Binggen, and others without paying their pension funds, causing all the workers at the new factory to declare a slowdown on the 29th. Later, because the factory refused the workers' demands and forced the dismissed workers to be dismissed altogether, the workers at the old factory rose up in support, and the situation further escalated. The Chamber of Commerce believes that labor-capital disputes can be resolved legally, but the company, due to its national status, refused to comply with the government's legal mediation, resulting in a prolonged stalemate. It seems that the company has not taken into account the position of public utilities and the importance of labor-capital cooperation, which cannot but be regretted. Therefore, a declaration is specially issued as follows, hoping to arouse the company's attention:</p>
<h3>Company Notice</h3>
<p>The company issued a notice to the workers yesterday, stating that many incorrect statements have recently been found in the newspapers in this city. The company has no choice but to describe the facts in detail to avoid being misled by false statements. (1) The 5% worker pension fund previously issued during the Municipal Council era has now been reduced to 1% or 2%. Furthermore, the company can arbitrarily cancel this reduced pension fund. For dismissed workers, the company can falsely claim that the workers were dismissed due to misconduct, and the pension fund can be refused. The correct facts are as follows: When the company was not separated from the Municipal Council, employees who had worked for 20 years or more were given a severance payment regardless of the reason for their departure, calculated at 5% of their annual salary per year of service. However, those who left before 20 years of service were not entitled to this right. This was an extra bonus to the salary, and the intention was to encourage employees to cooperate with the company. Therefore, the company agreed to accept this method and continue to implement it. Later, the company, together with the Municipal Council, revised the severance payment regulations. According to the company's method, employees who have worked for 15 years or more will be given a severance payment of 5% of their annual salary per year of service, regardless of the reason for leaving the job. In addition, employees who have worked for less than 15 years and are dismissed by the company not due to their own fault will also be given the severance payment proportionally according to their length of service. Except for these regulations, no severance payment will be given. Employees who have worked for less than 15 years and are dismissed by the company due to their own fault, or because they are not diligent in their service, or because they sleep during work, or because they are arrested for leaving their posts without authorization, will not be able to enjoy this severance payment. These employees, whether in the Municipal Council era or in the company era, cannot enjoy the severance payment. The company has never violated the above-mentioned regulations. Worker Xue A'bao took sick leave on September 13 this time. His condition was examined by a Chinese doctor, and because it was suspicious, the doctor suggested that only two days of sick leave should be given. Xue returned to the factory on September 15 and stated that his illness had fully recovered. However, after September 15, Xue left again and did not go to work. On the morning of September 25, Xue went to the Yangshupu factory sign room and claimed that he had to resign and asked the company to calculate his salary. However, when the salary was handed over for him to sign, Xue refused to receive it because the above-mentioned severance payment was not paid together. Employee Dai Renheng left his work place without authorization and was dismissed. Employee Zhou Binggen left his work place and slept during work and was dismissed. Obviously, none of the above can enjoy the severance payment. Also, the company did not receive prior notice of this strike, and the two representatives never met with the company authorities.

<h3>Various Cotton Mills Gathered to Discuss and Contribute Opinions on Cotton Industry Control</h3>
<p>Because the National Economic Council has been formally established and has officially published a letter to the people regarding the cotton industry control issue, the cotton mills were extremely excited about this news. They held a dinner party at the Yiyou Society the night before last, with more than 20 factories such as Shenxin, Yong'an, Dasheng, Zhentai, Puyi, Dacheng, and Sanyou attending to discuss various issues related to saving the cotton industry in order to contribute to the cotton industry control committee for adoption. According to people in the industry, the government is determined to save the industry and has already prepared considerable measures. As soon as the committee is formally established, it can be implemented immediately.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs the Ministry of Communications, Requesting the Recovery of the Telephone Installation Rights in the Concession, Which Were Not Permitted to Be Operated by Foreign Merchants According to the Concession Regulations, and the Root-and-Branch Solution Should Be That Our Country Recovers Them at a Reasonable Price</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Communications the day before yesterday, stating: To the Ministry of Communications: We believe that telephone service is a public utility and should be based on fair charges and convenience for the common people. However, the Public Concession Telephone Company, due to its foreign-owned company status, has not taken into account the morality that should be observed in this matter. For example, after converting to automatic switchboards, it raised prices just one year ago and is now proposing to raise prices again, violating its contract with the Municipal Council. Also, after the five-cent call fee was abolished in the Chinese area, users have repeatedly requested that the concession be handled uniformly, but the company has brazenly ignored this. All these situations have caused great indignation among the citizens. For the sake of public interest, the national authorities should correct this. We believe that although the company is located within the concession area, most of its users are Chinese. According to the Yangjingbang Concession regulations, there is no regulation that public utilities in the area should be permanently operated by foreign merchants. The root-and-branch solution should be that our country recovers them at a reasonable price, which will benefit the people and promote unification. Recently, there have been precedents for recovering the right to install water lines. We request that your ministry resolutely uphold justice and bring it to fruition. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce respectfully pleads.</p>
<h3>Industrial Safety Association Decides to Conduct Boiler Inspections</h3>
<p>The Industrial Safety Association held its fifth board meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday. Directors Hu Xiyuan, Li Xinfu, Su Gongxuan, Zhu Ligong, Yang Yongnian, Fang Jicheng, etc. attended. Boiler inspection experts Liang Zhongjian and Lu Jicang, etc. were present.

First, boiler expert consultant Liang Zhongjian issued an inspection plan, and then the directors discussed it. It was decided that (A) the budget for the inspection plan, instrument equipment costs, and inspection fees should be drafted by experts Liang Zhongjian and Lu Jicang. (B) The equipment costs required for boiler inspection will be raised by the association, or first advanced by the members, and then returned later. (C) After the equipment is purchased, a trial inspection will be carried out in the factories of the members first, and then the promotion will be planned. It is heard that the association's boiler inspection work is highly appreciated by the factories, and the government and the factories will be able to reduce the burden in the future. The association will also convene the cleanliness instructors of the member factories at 2:00 PM today to organize a cleanliness guidance committee to discuss the implementation plan.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin to Go to Japan This Morning</h3>
<p>Jiang Zuobin, the minister of our country stationed in Japan, has now been ordered to go to Japan and return to his post as minister. Yesterday, he sent his secretary Ding Shaoji to the Japan Post Office to book two second-class rooms on the postal ship Chichibu Maru. He is scheduled to board the ship at the Huishan Wharf in Yangshupu at 7:00 AM today, accompanied by two servants. Takata Toshihiko, the Japanese consul stationed in Hankou, has been summoned back to his country this time. He arrived in Shanghai from Hankou yesterday. Because he is on the same ship to Japan as our country's Minister Jiang, he specially changed his passenger seat on the Chichibu Maru and will also leave Shanghai this morning. The Hubei Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association held a public farewell banquet yesterday afternoon at the Ping'an Hotel Building on Zhubao San Road, with more than 100 fellow villagers from Hubei attending.

<h3>Li Jingcong Talks About Eurasia Aviation, the Guangdong-Hankou Line Will Be Officially Opened Soon, the Gansu Authorities Detain the Plane Without Receiving a Telegram</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Li Jingcong, the manager of Eurasia Aviation, told reporters: (1) The company increased its capital by 210,000 yuan. The shareholders decided through consultation that our side should pay 140,000 yuan, which has been approved by the Ministry of Communications and will be paid whenever the company needs funds. (2) The Guangdong-Hankou line has already been tested and preparations are underway. It will be officially opened on a scheduled basis after the success of the Eurasia joint transport. (3) The Eurasia joint transport is unlikely to be implemented in the short term due to the recurrence of the Xinjiang incident. (4) The report that the Gansu authorities detained Plane No. 1, the company did not understand the truth. The plane was chartered from the company by a certain agency, departed from Shanghai, and is currently detained in Suzhou. Whether it was detained has not been reported by telegram. The company never inquires about the nationality or passport of passengers when purchasing tickets, which is no different from all transportation agencies. However, private planes are not easily contacted unless they are responsible government agencies or social celebrities. This time, Plane No. 1 was responsible by a certain agency, so the passengers and their tasks were not questioned. It was also unknown whether Japanese people were on board when they left Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Yu Ming and Zhao Tiezhang Visited Consul General Mack Yesterday Morning, They Talked to Each Other for Ten Minutes Before Leaving</h3>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Guangdong Line Will Be Opened Soon, the Shutdown Rumor Is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation's newly opened Shanghai-Guangdong line has not yet been opened to traffic due to the fact that the facilities such as wireless telegraph, weather report, and seaplane airport along the route have not been completed since the successful test flight in July. As a result, rumors have spread, leading to the misunderstanding that it has been temporarily shut down. In fact, this news is completely inaccurate. According to Deng Junjialian, the person in charge of the company yesterday, the line is expected to be opened to traffic in the shortest possible time and is currently being actively prepared. All kinds of rumors are completely unfounded. Because the places along the line, such as Ningbo, Wenzhou, Xiamen, Fuzhou, Shantou, and Guangzhou, are all major coastal trading ports, and after the opening of the line, it will be of great benefit to the national transportation. Guangdong will certainly express its approval, and it is expected that after the opening of the line, the business will be very developed and the income will increase. Therefore, the company also very much hopes that the line can be opened to traffic as soon as possible, which will not only benefit transportation but also increase income.</p>
<h3>The Raw Materials for the Ninghai Aircraft Were Shipped to Shanghai Yesterday, It Can Be Completed in Two Months After All Are Shipped</h3>
<p>When the Ninghai ship was ordered, there was originally one aircraft. Now, in order to enhance its strength, a reconnaissance aircraft was ordered from the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office. The office has already started work, and all the wood materials have been purchased. The wood part has been manufactured first. As for the metal raw materials, they were ordered from foreign countries and will be shipped to Shanghai in three batches. Except for the first batch that has already been shipped to Shanghai, the second batch was also shipped to Shanghai yesterday. However, it is not yet determined when the third batch will be shipped to Shanghai. According to Zeng Yijing, director of the Naval Aircraft Manufacturing Office, the Ninghai aircraft can be completed in full within two months after all the metal raw materials are shipped.</p>
<h3>Zhuang Songfu Plans to Establish the Zhejiang Provincial Fishermen's Autonomous Federation, He Passed Through Shanghai from Hangzhou Yesterday and Talked About It</h3>
<p>Zhuang Songfu of the Zhejiang Provincial Autonomous Committee went to Zhenhai, Xiangshan, Yin County, Cixi, etc. last month to investigate the local autonomy situation. After returning to the province, he expressed some views on the Zhejiang Provincial Autonomy Plan. Yesterday, Zhuang passed through Shanghai from Hangzhou and took the Hongxing ship to Yong, then to Nantian and Ninghai counties to investigate autonomy. Zhuang told visitors yesterday that he recently plans to establish a Zhejiang Provincial Fishermen's Autonomous Federation. The people on land have autonomy, and the people on the water may also have autonomous groups. Now, fishermen are being robbed by pirates and exploited by fishermen and merchants, which is becoming increasingly bankrupt. The reasons are: (1) Fishermen are not united. When one ship encounters thieves, other ships avoid and do not help, relying on fate and not thinking about remedies. (2) The fishing boats and fishermen of each gang are of uneven quality. They are not inspected at ordinary times, so thief ships are mixed among them, and no one interferes. (3) Fishermen do not have a joint organization, so there is no fixed price regulation in terms of sales, and it is monopolized by fishermen and merchants. The above reasons are the fundamental reasons for the direct damage suffered by fishermen. Therefore, it is planned to establish a fishermen's autonomous federation, with five blood ships compiled as a row, ten rows compiled as a class, and each gang compiled as a risk. Each team has an office, and the offices are jointly formed into a general autonomous group. The group will establish fishermen's self-defense corps, production and marketing cooperatives, etc., so that they can help each other from beginning to end and form a cohesive whole, which is the fundamental method to maintain the fishery. If this proposal can be adopted, it is planned to start in Zhejiang Province first.</p>
<h3>CMSNC Leases Three Seaships and Cancels</h3>
<p>The state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company (CMSNC) leased the Pu'an ship from the Ministry of the Navy to operate jointly, traveling between Qingdao and Putuo. Since July 17th this summer, the three-month term expired on the 16th of last month and operations were suspended. However, the Qingdao Municipal Government, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Jiaoji Railway Bureau, in view of the fact that the Shanghai-Qingdao sea line was mostly monopolized by Japanese ships, repeatedly wrote letters requesting that the Pu'an ship resume the Shanghai-Qingdao line as soon as possible in order to restore rights. The CMSNC responded to the requests from all parties and decided to discuss with the Ministry of the Navy to continue the lease. In order to expand its business, it planned to rent the Jing'an and Ke'an ships at the same time. However, the Ministry of the Navy planned to sell the Jing'an to the Sanbei Company, and the price had been agreed upon. Therefore, the CMSNC's plan was difficult to implement. Now, the CMSNC has received a letter from the Ministry of the Navy stating that the Pu'an ship has other uses and will be taken back. The Ke'an ship is also too deep in draft, and the CMSNC's docking at the wharf after leasing it would be very difficult, so it is not planned to lease it alone. The bureau's three-ship lease plan with the Ministry of the Navy has been completely cancelled.</p>
<h3>Pudong Pier Workers Petitioned the Municipal Government Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>A dispute occurred among the workers at the Dade Xing Warehouses pier in Yangjiadu, Pudong, and has repeatedly been</p>
<h2>Page 14</h2>
<p>mediated by the Pier Party Affairs Office without success. The office then petitioned the municipal government for a solution. At 10:00 AM yesterday, about 100 pier workers went to the Wulin Bridge Municipal Government to petition, and four representatives, Gao Guanghui, Feng Jiansheng, Song Guilin, and Sheng Sanyou, were selected to request an audience with the mayor. The mayor was ill and did not come to the government, so the secretary-general sent the second section member Mai to meet them. The representatives stated their intentions, saying that the workers had been working at the Yuan Yi Warehouses, the CMSNC New Warehouses, and the Dade Ao Warehouses, etc., but recently foremen Yu Desheng, Zhang Yunpeng, etc. hired other workers to the Dade Xing Warehouses to transport goods, causing the workers to feel the pain of unemployment. Although the Pier Party Affairs Office had proposed a compromise solution, instructing each to work half a day at the pier or to work together, the other party did not accept it and still forcibly occupied the pier to transport goods. The workers were forced by livelihood and asked for a prompt resolution to avoid accidents. Section member Mai expressed acceptance of the workers' demands and said that he would solve them as soon as possible within the possible scope. The workers left around 11:00 AM.</p>

<h3>Key News on Disaster Relief for the Southern Sichuan Flood</h3>
<p>Two hurricanes were discovered last month, causing significant damage to coastal counties, especially Chuansha and Nanhui counties, which were the most severely affected. Therefore, disaster relief efforts have been quite busy. Key news is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Mu Jichu and Others Arrive in Chuansha to Inspect</h3>
<p>Mu Jichu, Zou Bingwen (represented by Ye Yuanding), Xu Jishi, inspectors of the Shanghai Pudong Storm and Flood Disaster Relief Committee, and Shen Zijian of the Pudong Fellow-Provincials Association, arrived in Chuansha from Shanghai at 10:00 AM on September 29th. After lunch, County Magistrate Li Leng and Cui Xilin, a member of the disaster relief committee, accompanied them to inspect the disaster situation along the coast of the fourth and fifth districts. According to Mu, the disaster situation in Chuansha County was indeed more severe than in Nanhui County. After returning to the committee and reporting, it was decided that clothing, rice, and other relief supplies would be provided continuously. Because Mu and others had other important matters, they were unable to inspect Hengsha and other places. They returned to Shanghai by long-distance bus at 9:00 AM the next morning.</p>
<h3>Third Committee Meeting Convened</h3>
<p>The third committee meeting was held at 10:00 AM on the same day. In addition to reporting items, the most important of the discussed items were (1) to distribute the cotton clothing purchased by the committee to the disaster victims in the fourth and fifth districts. Four committee members, including Lu Rong'an, were assigned to work with the district heads to handle this. As for the cotton clothing for the disaster victims in the sixth district, a telegram was sent to the Shanghai Pudong Storm and Flood Disaster Relief Committee to allocate it quickly. (2) The Shanghai Pudong Storm and Flood Disaster Relief Committee delivered 260 bags of relief rice during the meeting. It was immediately decided to allocate 140 bags to the fourth and fifth districts and 120 bags to the sixth district, to be managed by the district offices. Six committee members, including Xue Songgan, were assigned to supervise the process.</p>
<h3>Two Health Teams Arrive in Chuansha to Work</h3>
<p>Furthermore, the health team sent by the Relief Committee, totaling 18 doctors and nurses, arrived in Chuansha at 1:00 PM on October 1st. They were divided into two teams. One team of eight people was stationed in Bailonggang Town in the fifth district, and the other team of ten people was stationed on Gaodunsha Island in the sixth district. Zhu, the general affairs director of the disaster relief committee, and Yu, the chief inspector of the public security bureau, took care of them. After dinner, the team stationed in Bailonggang was sent to their destination by hired car on the same day. The team stationed on Gaodunsha Island stayed overnight in the city due to ferry connections and were sent by hired car the next day. With these saviors, the lives of the disaster victims should be secure.</p>
<h3>Relief Home Requests Sustained Charitable Acts</h3>
<p>The Xinwei Relief Association of this city received a telegram from Xu Naibing, Chuan Zuoheng, and others of the Nanhui County Relief Home, requesting continued support and assistance. The original telegram is recorded as follows: To the esteemed Xinwei Relief Association: Nanhui has been hit by two hurricanes, and along the coast, from Sanzao in the fourth district in the south to Qituan in the second district in the north, about seven miles long, more than 20 sections of dikes have been destroyed. The water is deep and submerging, and houses have been turned into ruins. The plight of the disaster victims has been reported in detail by County Magistrate Yuan and investigators from Shanghai charitable organizations. We are extremely grateful that major philanthropists have raised funds for emergency relief. However, this year's extraordinary disaster has not only affected coastal residents, but also the Relief Home. The Relief Home has approximately 18,000 mu of land, all located in the Ligongtang area along the coast. We rely entirely on collecting rent to maintain the annual operating expenses of 30,000 yuan. This year, we have been repeatedly affected by windstorms, and the Ligongtang dikes have been destroyed. The Relief Home's land has been the first to bear the brunt, and a vast expanse has become a swamp. This year's rent is not to be expected. Then, from where will come the funds for the current reformatory, old-age home, orphanage, women's shelter, orphanage, and monthly external care programs? If we want to stop, the livelihood of thousands of helpless poor people will be cut off. If we want to maintain, we have no way to borrow the huge sum of 30,000 yuan. We are in a dilemma, with no good solution. In addition to sending telegrams to various charitable organizations to seek relief, we hereby send a telegram to your esteemed association, requesting that you treat us equally and consider us at the same time, and provide us with appropriate assistance to maintain charitable acts. We are eagerly awaiting your instructions. Xu Naibing, Chuan Zuoheng, Ji Difan, Yang Binru, Zhao Xinmei, Pan Kejun, Zhang Jianqian, Pan Ziping, and Xia Chuankun of the Nanhui County Relief Home kowtow together.</p>

October 5, 1933, Ning Huaian, Supervisor; Bolaisen, Customs Commissioner.</p>
<h3>Major Changes in the Shanghai-Based Japanese Marine Corps</h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun yesterday, there will soon be major changes in the naval officers stationed in Shanghai. In particular, the officers of the Marine Corps, such as Commander Sugisaka, Staff Officer Kakuda, Staff Officer Iizumi, Adjutant Onuma, Battalion Commander Kawashima, 4th Company Commander Fukumoto, and Tank Unit Commander Iwaki, will all be replaced. However, Commander Sugisaka's replacement will be in December.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association Purchases Clubhouse at 32 Avenue Conty, French Concession, for 74,425 Yuan</h3>
<p>Since Tang Haian took office as chairman of the Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, he has worked actively and tirelessly. A large Western-style house at No. 32 Avenue Conty in the central area of the French Concession, complete with a garden and garage, has now been purchased. The hall is spacious, making it the most suitable place for gatherings of fellow provincials. The price of the house and land is 74,425 yuan. A deposit of 10,000 yuan was paid on the second of this month, and the remaining price will be paid within one month. The Guangdong Fellow-Provincials Association, which has been repeatedly discontinued and revived, has finally established a permanent foundation.</p>
<h3>Requests from Two Hospitals for Increased Subsidies and Tax Exemption Submitted to the Municipal Council for Discussion</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sanitarium and Health Hospital requested the Municipal Council to increase its annual subsidy by 5,000 taels in addition to the existing 5,000 taels due to increased treatment costs. According to the Director of Finance, it would not be convenient to increase the subsidy this year, but it could be considered next year. After deliberation by the Finance Committee, it was proposed that the subsidy should not be increased this year. If the hospital provides a detailed explanation of the situation, it could be considered in detail in next year's budget. This proposal was adopted by the Board of Directors on October 3rd.</p>
<p>The newly established Shanghai Mental Hospital requested that its address, Nos. 22-26, Lane 208, Kuling Road, be exempted from municipal taxes because the hospital is maintained by charitable donations and provides free treatment, and is recognized by the local court. According to reports from the Tax Bureau and the Health Department, the annual tax amount for this address is 675.50 yuan. However, the nature of the building is not suitable for severely ill patients and is prone to fire hazards. However, the hospital's work in receiving patients delivered by the court is necessary, and the Municipal Council's mental hospital has not yet been established. It seems that a tax exemption can be granted, but the Fire Department and the Health Department should supervise it at any time, and the matter should be reconsidered after six months. After reconsideration by the Finance Committee, it was proposed to approve the request. This proposal has been adopted by the Board of Directors.</p>
<h3>Wuhua Industrial Trust Bank Opens on October 12th</h3>
<p>The Wuhua Industrial Trust Bank was founded by prominent overseas Chinese. The head office is located in Guangzhou and has been in operation for more than ten years. There are branches in Hong Kong, Taishan, Xinchang, and other places. It has strong capital and a solid reputation. It is the most prestigious in the Guangdong financial community. Its total assets reach tens of millions. Due to the sharp increase in depositors at the Taishan branch, current deposits are even restricted from being accepted. Its greatness can be seen from this. Now, due to the flourishing business, a Shanghai branch has been added at the corner of Ningbo Road and Henan Road in this city, with a paid-up capital of one million yuan. Mr. Fan Shaoliang, who holds a master's degree in economics from Columbia University in the United States, has been appointed as manager, and Ye Haitian as deputy manager. Mr. Fan and Mr. Ye have held important positions in the banking industry for many years and are known for their excellent management skills, truly worthy of being called outstanding talents of their time. As for the bank's advisors, such as Mr. Tang Shoumin, Mr. Chen Bingqian, and Mr. He Shizhen, all are famous in Shanghai. With such a concentration of talent, the speed of future development will surely be rapid. The bank building is in Roman style (as pictured), with a solemn appearance and modern equipment. The groundbreaking ceremony will be held on the 12th of this month. All commercial banking services, as well as savings and trust services, are fully available. In particular, the ability to handle goods on behalf of customers is a unique feature that no other bank in Shanghai has, providing unparalleled convenience to customers. Invitations have been sent to various sectors to visit. It is expected that there will be a lively and grand occasion on that day with many guests.</p>

<h3>Case of Dancer Chen Hailun Against Xu Guannan and Son Resolved</h3>
<p>—Court Approves Withdrawal of Charges—</p>
<p>Xu Guannan, a wealthy merchant, has a son named Qi Zhong, a handsome young man, who is particularly fond of entertainment in singing halls and dance halls. He often lingers in these places. Chen Hailun, a dancer in a Shanghai dance hall, has a beautiful face and figure. She and Qi Zhong are deeply in love, appearing to be a married couple. Recently, for some unknown reason, their passionate love has turned sour. Hailun resented his abandonment halfway and could not accept it. She filed a lawsuit in the Second Special District Court accusing Qi Zhong of seduction. At the same time, she and her elderly mother, Chen Sha, went to the Xu residence at No. 61 North Zhejiang Road to demand living expenses. Unexpectedly, Xu Guannan, blinded by excessive love, did not value his son's defilement of women. Instead, he tried to protect him by beating Chen and her daughter. Chen, realizing that she could not withstand the power, endured the injury and humiliation and returned. She then hired a lawyer and filed a criminal self-accusation in the First Special District Court against Xu Guannan and Xu Qi Zhong, father and son, for assault, requesting that the case be summoned for trial. The Xus, after being sued, regretted their previous rashness and realized that they could not suppress the matter by force. They hired someone to mediate. An agreement has now been reached. Yesterday afternoon was the scheduled date for the trial of the case. The plaintiff had already submitted a request to withdraw the charges in advance. Therefore, neither party was present. Judge Wu Zehan announced that since the plaintiff had withdrawn the charges, the case would not be accepted.</p>

<p>Lu Ying, the captain of the detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, suddenly received an anonymous tip the day before yesterday, stating that a well-known female rogue, Lu Laoqi, had colluded with accomplices Xu Laosi, Xu Laowu, Xu Binggui, Jin Abin, and others to secretly set up a large flower association factory in the coffin shop warehouse at No. 97 Xitangjia Lane inside the Dananmen, luring people to gamble. Three rounds were opened every day, and the amount of winning or losing was very large. Furthermore, the day before yesterday, a dispute over the distribution of spoils almost led to a murder. Please arrest them quickly. After receiving the report, Lu secretly instructed team leader Chen Caifu to lead a large number of detectives disguised as gamblers and to cooperate with many police officers from the Second Precinct of the Second District to surround the house at No. 97 Tangjia Lane. However, Lu Laoqi had already fled after hearing the news. Only Jin Abing, Xu Laosi, Xu Laowu, and Xu Binggui were arrested, and many gambling slips, gambling funds, and other evidence were seized. After a preliminary interrogation of the team, he immediately prepared a document and submitted it to the Judicial Section for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Yao Xiaoyong Commits Suicide</h3>
<p>Yao Xiaoyong, a local resident, 26 years old, went to Room 15 of the Xiangxing Small Inn on Baliqiao Road in the French Concession at around 1:00 AM last night. Due to misappropriation of disaster relief funds, which caused trouble for the guarantor, he felt a sudden pang of conscience and had the thought of death. He secretly ingested opium paste and committed suicide. After being discovered by the teahouse, he was sent to Renji Hospital by car. The treatment was ineffective, and he died at around 4:00 AM. He left a suicide note addressed to his brother, named Borong, who lived at No. 47 Changan Lane, Maite Husted Road. The content stated that since serving in the French-owned Coal Company, several years had passed in a flash. Now, the disaster relief funds were used privately and there was no way to make up for it, and he had no face to see anyone. Recently, he heard that the company had detained the guarantor in the police station to investigate the accounts, and he felt deeply uneasy about the guarantor suffering on his behalf. He was ashamed to live in the world, and he only had one death to end it all, hoping to repay his life in the next life.</p>
<h3>Foreman Cuts His Throat Due to World-Weariness, Fear of Life-Threatening Danger</h3>
<p>Lu Xiangwang, a native of Haizhou, 58 years old, worked as a foreman in the Changxin Construction Factory on Xindagu Road. He had not married and felt lonely, which led to thoughts of world-weariness. Suddenly, at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning, he took a kitchen knife in his bedroom and slashed his throat twice. He immediately fell to the ground in extreme pain, bleeding profusely. After being discovered by colleagues, he was sent to the hospital for treatment. It is said that the injury was very serious and there was fear for his life.</p>
<h3>Gold Bracelet Stolen in City God Temple</h3>
<p>Zhu Xiaomei, a woman from Changzhou in her early twenties, lived in Wankang Sauce Garden on Hankou Road in the Public Concession. At around 10:30 yesterday morning, Xiaomei and four other female companions went to the City God Temple in the city to offer incense. A bandit had been secretly following the women and, when they reached the entrance of Yijintang Mounting Shop on Yu Garden Road, one of the bandits, wearing a black short shirt, took out a pistol, forbidding any noise. The other bandit snatched the gold bracelet on Xiaomei's arm and fled. Xiaomei suddenly grabbed the bandit with the gun and shouted for help. The bandit was anxious and fired a shot at the ground. Zhu then released her hand, and her companions scattered and fled. The two bandits calmly disappeared without a trace. After the police of the Second Precinct of the First District heard the alarm and rounded up, the bandits had long since disappeared.</p>
<h3>Astor House Ballroom Reopens for Autumn</h3>
<p>The ballroom of the Astor House Hotel at No. 7 Huangpu Road in this city has always been a gathering place for upper-class Chinese and Westerners. Now that the weather is turning cooler, high-class tea dances will resume daily from 5:00 PM to 7:00 PM starting on October 11th. The Huitaifu Grand Music Band has been hired to play modern dance music at the venue, which is extremely interesting. The entrance fee is only one yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Flower Associations Cracked Down On in French Concession</h3>
<p>Xue Dapao and Wang Zhiliang, both from Tianjin, have recently been engaged in the red pill business. They set up a sales organization at No. 9 Yuqing Lane, Xixinqiao Street, French Concession, and hired local resident Shi Gengsheng and Zhenjiang resident Zhu Jinsheng as partners. They also set up a manufacturing organization at the home of Xu Yuntang, a local resident, at No. 40 Linjiagang, Caojiadu. At 5:45 PM the day before yesterday, Shi Gengsheng and Zhu Jinsheng hired taxi No. 3625 from the Shijie Auto Repair Shop at No. 399 Edward Road, driven by driver Chen Aqihe, to go to the Caojiadu factory to retrieve three large blue cloth bags of red pills, containing 122 small bags, worth more than 1,000 yuan. They then returned to the Yuqing Lane organization in the same car to sell them. Unexpectedly, when the car was passing the intersection of Edward Road and Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession, a Western policeman from the French Concession Police Station No. 20 saw them and suspected that their actions were suspicious. The red pills were discovered, and the personnel were taken to the police station. After confessing the previous situation, detective Lu Zhulin, deputy detective Wang Rusong, Zhang Daorong, and detectives Liu Jinrong and Shen Jinshu went to arrest the leaders, Xue and Wang. However, they had already fled after hearing the news. Then, they reported to the Sixth District Public Security Bureau and requested four police officers to go to Xu Yuntang's home. Xu was arrested, and four large and small wooden barrels, three blue cloth bags, 100 small cloth bags, a pill-making board, two bags of white powder, a small bag of paint, a stone seal, a bag of sealing wax, and two iron trays were confiscated. They were taken to the Sixth District Office, and the evidence was temporarily stored. The arrest document was filed first, and Xu was taken back to the police station to await interrogation by the court. The same detectives, Lu and others, patrolled to the intersection of Minguo Road and Maidiean Road at 11:00 PM the night before and arrested Wang Zhihao, a Shaoxing native, for selling red pills. Six bags of red pills, totaling 6,000 pills, were found on his body. He confessed that he lived at No. 9 Ailaige Road, and the manufacturer was Xia Jisheng, nicknamed Xiaoshaoxing. The manufacturing organization was located upstairs in Xia's house. The detectives took Wang to No. 9 to arrest Xia. However, Xia fled from the roof after hearing the door knocking. Only two accomplices, Fan Jinyi from Jiangbei and Yuan Shunzi from Zhenjiang, were arrested, and all manufacturing equipment, red pill ovens, etc., were confiscated. They were taken back to the police station. The police chief ordered the three main criminals in the two cases, Xue, Wang, and Xia, to be brought to justice for interrogation. Yesterday afternoon, the police station escorted the criminals in both cases to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the interrogation. According to Gu Shouxi, the police station lawyer, the police station had not yet investigated the case, and the main criminals were still at large. He requested a postponement to investigate and file a lawsuit for interrogation. The court approved the request after verifying the report and questioning the defendants. The defendants were sent back to custody separately.</p>

<h3>Judge Liu Yugui Upholds Justice and Integrity, Investigates Corrupt Merchants According to Law, Believes That the Ten Corrupt Merchants Are Suspected of Infringing Upon Public Interests of Society, In Addition to Notifying Police Station for Investigation, Also Asks Unified Tax Bureau to Submit Evidence</h3>
<p>—Case of Dingxin Cloth Factory Suing Du Yifang to Be Tried Today—</p>
<p>Destroying the national unified resistance movement, specializing in privately selling enemy goods disguised as domestic goods, deceiving tax authorities, falsely obtaining transport permits, and secretly transporting and selling goods in various places, the famous corrupt merchants Gongzu Socks Factory, Sanyang Cotton Weaving Factory, Jiuyi Weaving Factory, Dingxin Cloth Factory, Yudong Socks Factory, Junchang Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yingzhou Dyeing and Weaving Factory, Yongyuan Mercerizing Factory, Yixinghao Shishi Dyeing and Weaving Factory, and other ten factory names, this time again changed the head and face of Japanese yarn, pretending to be Ren Zhong brand domestic yarn of Shenxin Fifth Factory, confusing the United Tax Bureau of the Su, Zhejiang and Anhui Regions of the Ministry of Finance, fraudulently obtained tax certificates, and openly started transportation. Soon after being discovered by the tax bureau, the inside story was completely exposed. All Chinese people thought that the corrupt merchants dared to risk all kinds of notoriety and act as accomplices for tigers, and they rose up to attack them. Shenxin Fifth Factory thought it was inconvenient to sit idly by, and Manager Rong Weiren made a complaint, requesting that the managers of Gongzu and other companies, Jin Xifan, Chen Zhongxian, Wang Liwei, Sun Xinzhu, Yu Yuxin, Zhou Songmao, Zi Zhixiang, Zhao Bingnan, Wang Gensheng, Guan Bingchu, and other ten corrupt merchants be punished with</p>
<h3>Deserved Punishment</h3>
<p>and ordered to compensate for losses of 200,000 yuan. After each defendant was notified, they knew that their crimes were inescapable and were extremely frightened. They had knelt down and begged Du Yuesheng and Wang Xiaolai to mediate for them, and they were willing to donate money to the Yellow River disaster relief association, which has been repeatedly recorded in this newspaper. At that time, Shenxin agreed to reconcile because it was a stumbling block to mediation, and formally submitted a statement to the First Special Court the day before yesterday (5th), requesting the withdrawal of the criminal self-accusation, but it has aroused the righteousness of various groups. Therefore, on the day before yesterday (5th), a statement was made to the Special First Court, requesting strict handling to prevent traitors and promote national law. At the same time, Liu Yugui, the criminal court judge of the First Special Court, which was hearing the case, even more</p>
<h3>Upholding Righteousness and Integrity</h3>
<p>A final and thorough investigation will be conducted, and all details have been extensively reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, at 2:00 AM, the third court hearing was held, presided over by Judge Liu in the first courtroom. The Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Unified Tax Bureau was notified in advance and requested to send a representative to the court. Consequently, the Bureau dispatched Chen Shaobo, a first-class clerk from the third section, carrying official documents from the Bureau to the court for consultation. However, all defendants still failed to appear as summoned, and their defense lawyer, Hu Chongji, was also absent. Therefore, Judge Liu briefly questioned the representative from the Unified Tax Bureau, Chen Shaobo, about his name, age, origin, and position. He then declared that although the plaintiff had submitted a request to withdraw the case, the matter was of great importance and could not be compared to ordinary cases. Furthermore, a portion of it concerned a</p>
<h3>Forgery</h3>
<p>incident. As such, it could not be freely withdrawn by the plaintiff. Moreover, the court believes that this case involves the suspicion of infringing upon public interests and social welfare. Therefore, the court has notified the police to investigate and verify the case in accordance with the law before further action. The Judge also requested that if the Tax Bureau had any opinions or relevant evidence, they should be presented to the police for investigation and verification, and that this message should be conveyed to the Bureau. After the Judge finished speaking, Judge Liu issued an order to adjourn the court, pending further investigation and verification in accordance with the law. Later, reporters learned that when Gongzu Shichang and others reached a settlement, they</p>
<h3>Sent a Letter to Shenxin</h3>
<p>Fifth Factory. The original letter is recorded below: [To Mr. Rong Weiren of Shenxin Fifth Factory, with respect: This is to inform you that the various factories represented by us, due to the negligence of our staff, were deceived by Zhu Jinhua. The fact that your factory's tax invoices were fraudulently used has been reported to the authorities by your factory. We cannot escape the responsibility for criminal punishment. However, we are mindful that, apart from Yongyuan Silk Factory which has closed down as a result, and the person in charge of Yixing Yarn Company who has gone into hiding, the eight factories employ a total of over 3,000 workers. The total annual production volume of the eight factories amounts to over 3 million yuan. If we do not seek proper solutions, and the eight factories unfortunately follow the fate of Yongyuan, we would not only be sacrificing the shareholders' capital but also bear the responsibility of increasing unemployment and destroying production to society. The shareholders of the eight factories, in view of this, are determined to</p>
<h3>Strive for Self-Renewal</h3>
<p>and uphold the principles of maintaining production and livelihoods. We earnestly request Mr. Du Yuesheng, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Mr. Zhang Zilian, Mr. Zhu Wenqi, Mr. Ge Shengru, and others to serve as mediators. Mr. Du, Mr. Wang, and others, taking pity on the livelihoods of over 3,000 workers and emphasizing the annual production capacity of over 3 million yuan, decided to donate funds for disaster relief and purchase domestic yarn as the principles for self-reproach and self-improvement of the eight factories. They agreed to have Mr. Zhang Ziying, Mr. Zhu Wenqi, and Mr. Ge Shengru invite both parties to mediate. An agreement was reached with a donation of 30,000 yuan and regulations for purchasing domestic yarn. We take this opportunity, in addition to punishing negligence, to guide the eight factories that are striving to survive to follow the path of controlled raw materials and be incorporated into the right track of fighting for the country.</p>
<h3>Rescue from Danger and Encourage Goodness</h3>
<p>Your kindness is deeply appreciated. We are not insensible and dare not fail to renew ourselves. Following the agreement, we have already collected 30,000 yuan for donation and deposited it with Mr. Du Yuesheng for disaster relief. We have also initiated the Domestic Yarn Purchase Center, intending to expand the scope of the purchase center by associating with our fellow tradesmen, based on the determination of the eight factories. Thanks to your factory's forgiveness, the encouragement of the mediators, and the joint participation of other tradesmen, the scope is expanding day by day. Your factory's cause of forgiving the past today will surely lead to the vigorous promotion of domestic yarn in the future, yielding boundless harvests. This will not only benefit the eight factories but also benefit the livelihoods of the eight factory workers and the future of domestic yarn production. We sincerely write this letter, hoping to receive your blessings. With hurried writing, we cannot express all our thoughts. We respectfully send this message, wishing you peace and security. Respectfully submitted by the eight factories including Gongzu. ] It was also learned that Sun Xinzu of Dingxin Cloth Factory, who was implicated in the case due to the discovery that Shichang Company was</p>
<h3>Selling Enemy Goods</h3>
<p>passing off as domestic yarn, forging documents, filed a criminal self-prosecution and an attached civil lawsuit against Du Yifang of Lichang Chunji Yarn Company on Aidao Ya Road in this port, accusing him of using forged tax invoices and demanding 10,000 yuan in damages. The case was heard on September 22nd and 29th. However, the defendant Du Yifang failed to appear on both summonses, making it impossible to conduct the hearing. Therefore, during the previous court session, the plaintiff's attorney, Min Ganghou, applied to the court for an arrest warrant to prevent the defendant from escaping. The court adjourned the hearing and set a new date. It is now known that this case is scheduled for a public hearing at 2:00 PM today in the Criminal Court of the First Detention Center.</p>
<h3>Yuan Songshan, Accountant of Dingtong Company, Sentenced for Smuggling Red Pills - A Large Batch of 420 Pounds of Red Pills Seized - The Main Culprit Zhao Shancai Fled with His Entire Family in Fear of Punishment</h3>
<p>—Yuan Songshan Sentenced to One Year of Imprisonment; Two Accomplices Sentenced to Six Months Each—</p>
<p>Zhao Shancai, who established a factory in the countryside west of Shanghai, specialized in manufacturing red pills and secretly transporting them for sale inland. The transportation was planned by a Mr. Yu residing at No. 33 Aidao Ya Road, a Mr. Feng residing at No. 28 Aierjin Road, and Yuan Songshan (nicknamed Yuan Shikai), an accountant from Dingtong Transportation Company on Jie Road, who was from Wuxi. They had never failed before. At 2:00 PM on the 29th of last month, Zhao and others hired Yin Zuoyu's cargo truck to drive to the border between the Chinese and French concessions, where they loaded three large boxes of red pills, intending to transport them to the North Railway Station and then by train for sale inland. However, the secret plan was discovered by Liu Junjie, an investigator from the General Inspectorate, who, along with Detective Liu Shaokui, Deputy Detective Song Bingzheng, and Ping Zhiming, waited at the bridge on North Xizang Road, which was a necessary route. They soon saw a</p>
<h3>Cargo Truck</h3>
<p>coming from the south and heading north at high speed. The detectives immediately ordered the truck to stop and arrested Yin, the driver Fang Ajiu, and the two workers Zhang Agen and Liu Burong, along with Yan Baoqi. Upon inspecting the boxes, they found that each box contained seven large bags of Silver Horse brand red pills, and each bag was divided into forty small bags. They took the truck back to the police station along with the arrested individuals. The total weight was 420 pounds. After interrogating Yin and others, Yin confessed that the red pills were to be delivered to Jiang Afu at the station, who was still waiting there. The detectives then took Yin to the North Station and arrested Jiang Afu. Jiang confessed that he was a</p>
<h3>Foreman at Dingtong</h3>
<p>and that the company's accountant, Yuan Songshan, had ordered him to load the red pills into the cargo room, so he was waiting there. The detectives then arrested Jiang and Yuan. The next morning, they were taken to the First Special District Local Court, where Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the case. Except for the driver Fang Ajiu and the three workers Zhang, Liu, and Yan, who were confirmed to be unaware that the goods being transported were prohibited drugs, they were allowed to post bail and wait for further questioning. Yin and Jiang were detained, and Yuan Songshan was released on 3,000 yuan bail, pending further investigation. Later, the investigating detectives found that the main culprit, Zhao Shancai, lived at No. 24 Julai Da Road in the French Concession. When they went to investigate the address along with detectives from the French police, they found that Zhao had already heard the news and</p>
<h3>Fled with His Entire Family</h3>
<p>leaving behind little furniture. After searching, they found many wrapping papers and towels. The trademark on the towels was the same as the trademark on the towels seized from the truck that was used to wrap the red pills. They then searched the residences of Mr. Yu and Mr. Feng, but only found a contract signed by Feng with the Zhongxing Coal Mine Company for transporting coal. Yesterday morning, the case was continued. The police brought the defendants to court for questioning. Judge Qian presided over the hearing. First, the police lawyer, Qian Xunjiu, explained the progress of the ongoing investigation and presented the towels, the contract, and other items as evidence. Then, the detective Liu Junjie reported the</p>
<h3>Investigation Work</h3>
<p>and the results he had obtained. An employee surnamed Wang from the Zhongxing Coal Mine Company also appeared in court to prove that the contract signed with Mr. Feng was for transporting coal. At this point, lawyer Qian presented another letter, stating that the police had received this letter after solving the case and that the court could understand the relationship between Dingtong Company and the case after reading it. Judge Qian then questioned the defendant Jiang Afu, but Jiang denied everything and retracted the facts he had confessed during the initial hearing, claiming ignorance. Judge Qian then read his previous statement [Yuan Songshan told me that there were several</p>
<h3>Oriental Goods</h3>
<p>and ordered me to load them into the cargo room, giving me one yuan per piece. A few days later, Yuan said that the goods had arrived, and I asked him what kind they were. Yuan said they were red pills and would give me one hundred yuan per box] for him to hear. Jiang then lowered his head and said nothing. The defendant Yuan Songshan also completely denied everything, saying that he was falsely accused by Jiang. However, Yin Zuoyu had previously confessed that he knew the items being loaded were red pills. Now, he suddenly recanted his confession, claiming that he did not know they were red pills at first, and only found out after the case was solved. The court had already learned the truth and immediately ordered the start of the debate. After the police lawyer and the defendants' lawyers had completed their arguments, Judge Qian sentenced Yuan Songshan to one year of imprisonment, Yin Zuoyu and Jiang Afu to six months of imprisonment each, and Fang, Zhang, Liu, and Yan were released. The red pills and other items were confiscated.</p>
<h3>A Woman Died Tragically - Saving One Yuan through Hardship - Enduring Abuse and Humiliation, She Ended Her Life</h3>
<p>—Mrs. Ye Can Be Said to Have Indirectly Caused the Death—</p>
<p>Sun Buyao, a 25-year-old Ningbo native from Fenghua, residing at No. 41 Xisanli Bridge, South Pier, Pudong, in the house of landlord Mrs. Wang Ye, worked as a carpenter. His family was very poor. His wife, Mrs. Pan, was 19 years old, and the couple had a very good relationship. However, Mrs. Pan saved some money every day when buying groceries and deposited it with the landlord, Mrs. Ye. Recently, she had accumulated a total of one silver dollar. Mrs. Ye told Sun that his wife had saved one silver dollar from her grocery money and deposited it with her, and that she would deduct this one dollar, so Sun only needed to pay back five more dollars. Sun was moved to tears by his wife's frugality. However, Mrs. Pan, knowing that Mrs. Ye should not have revealed her secret, fearing that her husband would blame and scold her, argued with Mrs. Ye. Mrs. Ye even slapped her twice. Mrs. Pan, humiliated and feeling like she did not want to live, took advantage of her husband's inattention and ran alone to the shore of the South Pier around 8:00 PM, jumping into the river to commit suicide. Because it was dark, she could not be rescued in time and drowned. Her body sank and its whereabouts are unknown. Others informed Sun, who rushed to report to the Third Precinct of the Third District. Director Dong ordered the police to summon Mrs. Ye to the station. The plaintiff claimed that although his wife did not die at Mrs. Ye's hands, Mrs. Ye caused her to seek death and requested justice. The defendant confessed that the deceased argued with her during the day and that she slapped her twice, but she did not expect her to seek death. The Director, considering the tragic circumstances of the case, ordered Sun Buyao to hire someone to find and retrieve the body for an autopsy, and also sent the plaintiff and defendant to the Local Court for questioning.</p>

<h3>Ferry Overloaded with Passengers - Several Female Workers Drowned - Ferryman Still Trying to Shirk Responsibility - Female Worker Appeared at the Scene to Testify</h3>
<p>Between Xiaonanyang Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong, and the Fair Road Wharf in Hudong across the river, there is a type of wooden ferry that specializes in carrying male and female workers who live in Pudong and work in factories such as the Nanyang Tobacco Factory in Hudong back and forth across the river. According to the regulations of the Customs, this type of ferry is only allowed to carry 30 passengers at a time. However, because workers are concerned about the time when they go to work, and are eager to return home after work, they all rush to get on and off the boat, causing extreme crowding. In addition, the ferrymen are greedy for profit, carrying as many as 70 to 80 passengers each time. The deck and cabin are so crowded that there is no place to stand. When sailing in the river, it is extremely dangerous. In March of last year, a boat was sunk by the Customs' Jingguang Steamboat at night, resulting in the tragic drowning of more than 30 female workers. Incidents of passengers falling into the river due to crowding are also common. At around 6:00 AM yesterday, Ferry No. 4357 was loaded with more than 70 female workers from the Nanyang Tobacco Factory at the Pudong Wharf, heading towards the opposite bank. At that time, it was misty with light rain. When the ferry approached the wharf on the opposite bank, a wave suddenly rolled in, causing the boat to tilt slightly. About six or seven female workers standing at the bow of the boat fell into the river at the same time. The captain and crew of the boat, seeing the trouble they had caused, tried to rescue them. They immediately rescued four people, but two or three others were not seen resurfacing. The crew sent the rescued workers ashore, allowing them to return home on their own. After the accident, the captain and crew fled in fear of punishment. The Yangshupu Water Patrol Police learned of the incident and quickly dispatched Detective Shen Changshan and Xu Juelu to investigate. They arrested the captain Wang A'er and the crew member Sun Liujiu, and summoned Pu Fenying, a female worker from the Nanyang Tobacco Factory, as a witness. According to Wang and Sun, a small steamship passed by at the time, causing a surge of waves, which caused the boat to tilt slightly and four female workers to fall into the river. However, they had rescued them all and denied that anyone had drowned. Pu Fenying, who lives at No. 8, Lane 35, Tutitang Street, Lujiazai, Pudong, and works at the Nanyang Tobacco Factory, stated that she boarded the boat at Xiaonanyang Wharf with her sister-in-law Wang A'mao and her roommate Zuo Yuezhen at around 6:00 AM this morning to cross the river. When the boat tilted, she saw seven or eight women fall into the river at the same time. Zuo Yuezhen and her sister-in-law were among them. The crew rescued her sister-in-law and three strangers, but Zuo Yuezhen did not resurface. After being rescued, her sister-in-law drank a lot of water, had difficulty breathing, and even coughed up blood. She took her home for treatment, and her life was generally out of danger. After the police obtained the testimony, they sent a detective to summon Zuo Yuezhen's daughter Zhao Di to the police station. Zhao Di stated that her mother was 34 years old and from Siyang, Jiangbei. Her father, Zuo Yuzhang, was farming in their hometown. Only her mother, her younger sister, and herself were in Shanghai. She was 14 years old and also worked at the Nanyang Factory. She crossed the river earlier this morning and did not expect her mother to die tragically. The police head noted that the witness Pu Fenying had testified that she saw seven or eight people fall into the water, only four were rescued, and it was confirmed that one person had died. It would not be difficult to find out about the other two or three people. The defendants had violated the Customs regulations by overloading passengers and endangering public safety. He ordered them to be sent to the Local Court for questioning. Family members hired three fishing boats to search for the deceased Zuo Yuezhen all day, but had not found her by last night.</p>
<h3>Gang Leader Bi Xiaowuzi Exposed - Forcibly Seized Embroidered Indian Silk - The Gang's Hideout and Stolen Goods Were Found</h3>
<p>Zhao A'er, a 35-year-old native of Haimen, worked as a sailor on the Taizhou steamer. Yesterday morning, Zhao brought 25 packages of embroidered Indian silk, totaling 650 pieces, worth a considerable sum, from Haimen on behalf of a customer. He divided them into two hemp bags. After disembarking, he hired a rickshaw and placed the hemp bags on the hood and footboard of the rickshaw, intending to deliver the goods to the customer in Zhabei. However, when he arrived at the entrance of Baodai Lane in Xiaodongmen, a robber suddenly came from behind the rickshaw, first used a sharp knife to cut open the hemp bag on the hood, and then forcibly seized 50 pieces of embroidered Indian silk, carrying the stolen goods and fleeing into the small alley. Zhao, noticing the theft, quickly got off the rickshaw and shouted "Catch the thief!" However, considering the remaining goods on the rickshaw, he dared not chase after the robber and could only watch him go. He then reported the situation to the Second Precinct of the First District and requested that the police track down the robber. After receiving the report, Director Liu ordered Police Chief Li Fuyi to go to the scene and secretly investigate. They learned that the stolen goods were currently in the home of Bi Changxi, a native of Yangzhou, at No. 7 Yutang Lane in Baodai Lane. Bi, also known as Xiaowuzi, was the leader of a gang that specialized in robbing travelers' luggage near Minguo Road. The robbers under his command had to send the goods they robbed to Bi's house first, where he would divide the spoils. The robber who seized the Indian silk this time was also one of Bi's men. They immediately went to Bi's house and arrested Bi Xiaowuzi. On the spot, they found 16 pieces of the stolen Indian silk in his house. They also brought Wang Heshang, a native of Changzhou, who was also in the house, back to the precinct. After a preliminary hearing by the Director, considering that the robbery occurred in broad daylight, he ordered them to be temporarily detained for further investigation.</p>
<h3>The Sea-Beijing Circus Opens Today</h3>
<p>The Sea-Beijing Great Circus will open at 9:15 PM tonight at the former site of Dahua on Jing'an Temple Road and Gordon Road, with all arrangements completed yesterday. The circus will meet the eager Shanghai residents. The continuous rain has turned the entire venue into a pond, making it impossible to set foot. The circus's general manager, Mr. Sai Hui, and the owner, Mr. Hai Jingbo, spent all day personally directing workers to fill the entire venue with soil and coal slag, transforming it into a grand circus arena. On Thursday afternoon, the tall masts for the big top were erected, and the stakes were driven in. Finally, the big top was raised. At that time, there were hundreds of curious onlookers surrounding the camels, elephants, and other animals. The entire venue was surrounded by the circus's large vehicles. Some of these vehicles served as living quarters for the performers and as offices for the circus, making it extremely convenient. Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Hai Jingbo reported that regardless of the weather, the big top must be raised in time, and the first performance will proceed as scheduled tonight. The XQMA radio station will report on the interesting facts about the circus's various wild animals and their training methods. It is said that the most important secret is to use a kind attitude to win the animals' affection, and then they can be trained as desired and at will. Tigers and elephants, which seem to have deep-seated hatred and fight each other when they meet, can also be made to perform after being trained with appropriate methods. On Sunday afternoons, there will be three performances at 2:30 PM, 5:30 PM, and 9:15 PM. Next Tuesday is National Day, and to entertain the citizens, there will also be three performances at the same times as on Sunday. On other days, except for Sunday, there will be two performances each day. The circus's zoo, which has over 200 lions, tigers, and other wild animals, will be open from 10:00 AM on Sunday. Tickets are 50 cents for adults and 20 cents for children and can be purchased at the entrance to the zoo. Before each circus performance, there is usually a parade through the major streets, but due to local traffic regulations, this is not possible. To compensate, the circus will have all the animals parade around the arena in formation before each act. Once the curtain rises, there will be no intermission, ensuring that the audience leaves satisfied. On Thursday evening, Mr. Hai Jingbo rode a tiger on the back of a giant elephant, which will also be performed by the circus. Mr. Hai continued, "The polar bear may seem very gentle on the outside, but it is actually the most cunning. It lives in the Arctic and does not encounter other animals to compete with. However, once it encounters its own kind, it will fight to the death, displaying the animal's cruel and combative nature."</p>

<h3>### Visit Records of Athletes from Five Provinces: Sichuan, Shanxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Yunnan; Shanxi Women's Tennis Shows Promise</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th Dispatch) The Shanxi delegation of sixty-two people, led by General Team Leader Wu Yunlong and Manager Wang Songqiao, departed from Taiyuan on the 2nd of this month and arrived in Pu yesterday morning at 8:00 AM. The delegation includes eight male staff members, two female staff members, forty-seven male athletes, and five female athletes. The province brought 5,000 yuan for travel expenses for the National Games. However, because the exchange rate differs from other provinces, the entire amount was exchanged for "ring dollars" (環洋). When reporters arrived at the dormitory, everyone was organizing a large number of silver dollars in their suitcases, the clanging sound reaching outdoors. According to Mr. Wu, the province held preliminary trials in Taiyuan on the 14th of last month. Inland provinces generally do not pay much attention to sports, resulting in lagging results in various events. Among the athletes participating in this National Games, women's tennis is the most promising. The Wang Chunqing and Wang Chuncang sisters, whose mother is American and father is a returned student from America, have a completely Americanized family education. They have a strong interest in tennis. The two ladies' amazing achievements are truly a gift of their family education. In addition, there are twelve athletes from the Zhengtai Railway Guard, including one soccer player, two basketball players, and nine participating in track and field events, with Gu Desheng and Yang Hongjun's 10,000 meters being the most promising, with a time of 36 minutes and 9 seconds. The team is currently staying in dormitories Huang No. 3 and 4.</p>
<h3>### Sichuan Province's Javelin is on Par with the National Level</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th Dispatch) The Sichuan athletes, ninety-six men and women, and nine staff members, a total of one hundred and five people, departed from Chengdu on the 24th of last month, stayed in Chongqing for three days, and arrived in Beijing yesterday morning at 8:00 AM. They were welcomed to the Central Sports Field by Jiangnan Motors, specially hired by the Games. According to representatives from the province, the athletes from the province feel they have no chance of winning at this National Games, but they will participate diligently. The athletes with relatively promising daily results are as follows: (1) In the men's division, Jiang Shungui's javelin has a result of 47 meters, which is equal to the national record; (2) Liu Dalin's 10,000-meter time is 36 minutes and 57 seconds; (3) Luo Tongsong's shot put is 12.67 meters; In the women's division: (1) Xiao [blank space]’s 50-meter time is 7.2 seconds; (2) Wu Suyun's 100-meter time is 14.1 seconds; (3) Wu Suyun's 80-meter hurdles time is 15 seconds; (3) Wang Yongbi's discus result is 22.40 meters. The provincial delegation is currently staying in dormitories Yuan No. 5 and 6 and Huang No. 1, a total of three rooms, at the Central Sports Field.</p>
<h3>### Anhui Province's Shot Put is More Promising</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th Dispatch) The Anhui delegation of one hundred and one people arrived in Beijing at noon on the 6th, including sixty male athletes, twenty-four female athletes, ten instructors, and six managers, led by General Team Leader Wang Duren. They are staying in the Central Sports Field, Song No. 6 and Gong Nos. 1 to 5 rooms. The province's travel expenses totaled 2,500 yuan, less than any other province. All athletes are able to save money and fight hard, which is commendable. In addition to baseball, volleyball, and softball, all other events will be participated in for the National Games championships. Only the women's tennis players Liu Lianfang [blank space] and the men's shot putter Shen Weishan are relatively promising, with Shen achieving 11.45 meters.</p>
<p>(Anqing, 5th Dispatch) The Anhui Province men's and women's athletes for the National Games, led by General Team Leader Wang Shuzhi, took the Jiangshun Wheel on the evening of the 5th to Beijing to attend.</p>
<h3>### Yunnan Team Leader Talks in Beijing</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th Dispatch) The Han delegation of one hundred and one people arrived in Beijing from Shanghai in the afternoon of the 6th, led by General Team Leader Luo Guangming, one manager, and nine athletes. According to reports, they departed from Kunming on the 21st of last month and were repeatedly subjected to unreasonable searches while passing through Annam and Hong Kong, fully experiencing the flavor of a weak nation, which was deeply distressing. Yunnan's position is similar to that of the Northeast, with the constant threat of losing the province. The enthusiastic participation of various provinces in this National Games shows the unity and struggle of the national masses, honing their skills to strengthen the physique of the masses to face the outside world. This team has been deeply touched and hopes even more for the success of the Games. School sports in Yunnan were presided over by military personnel until 1924, not knowing what ordinary sports were. After 1924, attention was gradually paid to various competitions. Currently, thanks to the advocacy of Chairman Yunlong in the province, the Provincial Sports Association has been established, with Yun serving as the chairman and Hall Director Gong Zhizhi serving as the vice chairman. Sports facilities have been slightly improved. The provincial capital has two sports fields, one sports school, and one people's education center, with small-scale basketball and volleyball courts, as well as a newly built swimming pool. Regarding the promotion of the province's sports plan, it is planned to first cultivate sports talents and gradually extend to various counties. The travel expenses for the team to Beijing are 300 yuan in national currency per person. After arriving in Beijing, the team deeply felt that the Central Sports Field is large-scale and fully equipped, and the staff of the Games are warm and helpful, for which they are immensely grateful.</p>
<h3>### Hunan Province's Results Are Still Difficult to Predict</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th Dispatch) The Hunan delegation of over one hundred and fifty people, including ninety-one male athletes and thirty-six female athletes, departed from Changsha on the 3rd, arrived in Hankou on the 4th, and arrived in Beijing today. According to the team, they are participating in all championships, but whether they can achieve satisfactory results depends on their actual strength and cannot be predicted.</p>

<h3>The Four Knights Arrive in Hong Kong to Help Chen; South China Crushes China Four to One; South China Crushes China Four to One; The First Battle of the Open Ordinary Cup; The Two Chinese Teams Make First Contact; The Victory is Decided in the Wind and Rain</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondence) The Hong Kong Open Ordinary Cup football match began on Saturday, with the first week of competition involving three groups in Divisions A and B. The twenty-four teams fought fiercely. However, because Division A did not have a Chinese team playing against a foreign team, it did not attract much attention from the general fans. Despite the longing for several days, few spectators attended the match that day. However, yesterday, when the two Chinese teams clashed at the Carrellin Hill Stadium, the crowd was so crowded that even though the Hong Kong Observatory hoisted Storm Signal No. 3, the enthusiasm was undiminished. Especially in the hilltop area, it was even more congested, thus affecting the match between Welsh and St. Joseph in So Kon Po. Except for some reporters, the rest were all foreigners. The details of yesterday's competition are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The South China-China match was one of the most watched football matches by Chinese and Westerners. At around 4:00 PM, the two Chinese teams came out of the changing room one after another and practiced briefly in front of their respective goals. Before the players took the field, the general audience had already determined that South China was strong and unstoppable, and that China, which had been silent for a long time, had recently been thriving and should not be underestimated. No one dared to make a definitive judgment on who would win. Then, the whistle blew and the game began. The two sides clashed, and it was difficult to tell who was better. The China team was weakened because Black Head Chen Zhenhe did not come due to unforeseen circumstances, Li Hongqing's foot injury had not healed, and veterans Chen Xipei, Liang Yutang, and Lin Yuying did not appear, compared to South China, which had four knights and ten soldiers to help Chen. About fifteen minutes into the first half, Bao Jiaping scored a goal for South China. The China team did not lose heart because of the failure and tried their best to counterattack, and Lai Zhaohan returned the favor with a goal, resulting in a tie. Then, Tan Jiangbai scored again for South China, and the first half ended with a score of two to one. In the second half, the two sides changed places to fight again. The China team's defense was exhausted. Bao Jiaping took advantage of the situation and scored another goal. At the end of the game, Huang Meiyuan scored another goal. As a result, South China won by four to one. Watching this match between the two Chinese teams, there was not much brilliant performance in the game, perhaps due to the rain and slippery mud on the field. The number of free kicks awarded by the referee was also rare in ordinary matches.</p>

<h3>The Grass Tennis Singles and Doubles Finals Are Postponed to the 21st and 22nd Due to Rain and the National Games</h3>

<h3>The Chinese Walking Association Will Participate in the National Games Performance; Currently Negotiating the Route and Date</h3>
<p>The Chinese Walking Association held a general membership meeting yesterday (5th) at its headquarters in Moore Hall. About fifty people attended, including Shi Jinsheng, Zhou Yuyu, Zhang Zaojiu, Zhou Ruquan, and Zhang Zhihe. The main organizer of the association, Shi Youhui, was unable to attend temporarily due to important matters, so Lu Yutian was elected as chairman and Zhang Xianlun as recorder, and the meeting was immediately convened to discuss matters such as the men's and women's open race, the international race, and participation in the National Games performance. The results were good. Finally, Shi Jinsheng and Zhou Yuyu gave speeches successively, explaining in detail the posture of walking and the points that should be paid attention to during practice. The listeners were moved. The meeting adjourned at 8:45. The decisions are as follows:</p>
<h3>Regarding the Men's and Women's Open Race</h3>
<p>(1) The competition date (29th of this month) is approaching, and various tasks need to be carried out urgently. In addition to Shi Youhui, Lu Yutian, and Zhang Zhaoxiang being responsible, Zhang Zhihe, Cheng Guan, Zhang Xianlun, and three others will be added to assist in everything. (2) In addition to Honorary President Cheng Yize being the ex officio chairman of the Awards Committee, Zhou Yuyu, Shi Jinsheng, Zhang Zaojiu, Ge Zhonggao, and Xu Aichen will be added as members to raise prizes. (3) It is decided to hold a full-length practice session once a week, with the association sending people to guide and hiring a horse-drawn carriage to follow in case of accidents.</p>
<h3>Regarding the International Walking Race</h3>
<p>(1) Since participating in the International Race, the Chinese team has won the championship for five consecutive times, which is not easy. It has added a lot of glory to the international community. Since this year's race is preparing for the 50,000-meter race at the World Games, the speed and pace may not be suitable. In addition, veterans Shi Jinsheng, Hou Genren, and others cannot practice, and their strength will inevitably be weak. They may not join the race, but those with excellent results should still join the competition. (2) After the closing of the open race, practice for the seventeen-mile race will begin immediately.</p>
<h3>Regarding the National Games Performance</h3>
<p>(1) This National Games will be attended by provinces and cities from almost all over the country. Take advantage of the Games to participate in the performance for publicity, in preparation for participating in the 1936 World Games in the future. The Games Organizing Committee believes that this walking event has considerable results and has approved the performance. (2) The expenses for going to Beijing to perform will be mostly settled. Shi Youhui will find a way to handle the accommodation and meals externally, and the local Bureau of Education has provided extra subsidies for travel expenses, which is greatly appreciated. (3) The performers' costumes should be Western-style dark blue tops and gray trousers, regardless of the material. When performing, they should wear blue short-sleeved T-shirts, white shorts, and white socks and black shoes to show neatness and to look good. (4) The association's emblem should be affixed to the upper left corner of the Zhuangqing top for identification. (5) Except during the performance, the performers are not allowed to wear walking shoes at ordinary times. (6) The date, route, and route of the performance will be announced after Lu Yutian is sent to Beijing in advance to negotiate. (7) The performers have been practiced once, but in order to ensure a good performance, another practice will be held at 7:00 AM this Sunday (tomorrow) morning to determine the performers.</p>
<h3>Registration of City Examinees for the National Examination in This City Will Close on the 10th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Central National Arts (Guoshu) Examination is approaching. The city's preparation for the city examination and selection of candidates to be sent to the examination may be insufficient. Yesterday, the Municipal Bureau of Education, the Public Security Bureau, and the Municipal National Arts (Guoshu) Museum consulted and decided to release a bulletin: The martial artists who passed the second city examination in this city should register at the Municipal First Public Sports Field on Rulin Road in the South City before the 10th of this month to be selected and sent to Beijing for the examination.</p>

China has also been catching up quickly. Li Shizeng and others established the Chinese National Library in Geneva as the initial foundation for international cultural cooperation. Domestically, the Sino-Polish Cultural Association and the Sino-German Cultural Association have been established one after another, which has also attracted considerable attention. It is recently learned that Chinese and British figures, recognizing the long history of Sino-British relations (nearly three hundred years) and the highly developed commercial ties, believe that since the British returned the Boxer Indemnity, it is necessary to support each other in cultural and academic fields on this occasion. Although most of the refund has recently been used for construction investment, such as loans for the Yuehan Railway, the Yellow River project, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, which are similar to technical cooperation, the fundamental principle has been stipulated in the exchange of letters regarding the refund that the interest from this fund will be used entirely for education and cultural undertakings. This year, the Board of Trustees for the Management of the British Boxer Indemnity Fund in China has already started sending government-funded students to study in the United Kingdom, and will continue this work in the future, hoping to develop the culture of both countries. As British Minister to China, Sir Miles Lampson, is approaching his return to his country, he is eager to make a final effort in such mutually beneficial and helpful endeavors. He specially invited more than a dozen British individuals, including Meyler and, Marshall, Egland, Hughes, to initiate the Sino-British Cultural Association, which was endorsed by twenty to thirty famous figures from Chinese political and academic circles. The English prospectus has already been printed and distributed, while the Chinese prospectus is currently being translated and revised. At the same time, members are being widely recruited to enrich the internal structure. The inaugural meeting is expected to be held in the capital around the National Day. However, according to what the reporter knows, most of the initiators on the list are individuals who studied in the United Kingdom and have returned to China, such as Zhang Daofan, Chen Jian, Wang Shijie, Tao Menghe, Chen Xigeng, Hang Liwu, Li Shengwu, Qian Changzhao, Wang Xinggong, Shi Ying, Zheng Tianxi, Luo Wengan, Wu Chaochu, Song Ziliang, Ge Jingen (and Li Siguang, Ding Bianlin, Zhou Gengsheng, Chen Yuan, Xu Xinliu, Zeng Rongfu, Lu Xingyuan, Liu Haiping, Li Yingong, Ye Yaoying, etc., are all in the same category), which seems to be slightly different from other international cultural organizations. In the future, when soliciting members, this may also be used as a standard, gathering people with similar academic interests and ways of handling affairs into one group, which will be more convenient for the promotion of association affairs. After the association is established, it is heard that its main work will focus on exchanging professors, establishing libraries, exchanging publications, guiding Chinese students to study in the United Kingdom, and receiving British people to travel, study, or investigate in China, striving to achieve mutual understanding and good neighborly relations between the people of the two countries, and to benefit the cultural future of both countries.</p>

<h3>The Boy Scout Review Has Been Postponed. The Defense Corps Has Been Selected to Conduct Preliminary Exercises.</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng originally scheduled to review the city's Boy Scouts and the City Security Team Defense Corps on October 10 after the completion ceremony of the new City Hall building in the city center. The Boy Scouts have been rescheduled due to muddy camping conditions after the rain. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Boy Scouts Rescheduled</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng had ordered the City Security District Defense Corps Boy Scouts to hold a review ceremony in the city center at 10:00 AM on October 10. The City Boy Scout Council, after receiving the order, had already notified its affiliated regiments to gather in the city center at that time to await the review. However, due to muddy camping conditions after the rain, a request has been submitted to the city government to postpone the event.</p>
<h3>Review Troops</h3>
<p>City Defense Corps (a total of fifty-odd regiments). Because there were many troops to be reviewed on that day, the Defense Corps plans to select 648 elite members from each regiment, divided into brigades, with 208 people in each team. Each team will have a captain, three squad leaders, and a commander, who will be appointed by the Security Department.</p>
<h3>Preliminary Exercises</h3>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency went to the headquarters of the Defense Corps and was received by the staff. According to them, Mayor Wu Tiecheng's scope of review on Double Ten Day was too broad, so the corps decided to select a total of six elite teams, with the chief commander being appointed by the training officer of the Security Department. The six teams of this corps will be led by instructors Zhu Yuanhui and Li Ling. As for the review ceremony, it is being drafted by the Security Department. The corps has scheduled to go to the exercise at 7:00 AM on the 8th and depart at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 10th to await the review. It is also rumored that the police of the Public Security Bureau will also be reviewed on that day. According to the chief inspector of the Public Security Bureau, the Public Security Bureau has not yet received an order, and the rumor is not accurate.</p>

<h3>Yellow Peril</h3>
<p>— Hutou</p>
<p>Speaking of the Yellow Peril, it is simply terrifying! Six hundred and fifty-seven years ago, during the reign of Emperor Ningzong of the Song Dynasty, there was a Mongol named Temujin who declared himself emperor on the Onon River, called himself Genghis Khan, destroyed the Song Dynasty, and had China, changing the country's name to Yuan and calling himself Emperor Shizu. At that time, the capital was in Yanjing, which is now Beijing. His territory stretched from the Sea of Japan in the east to Annam in the south, Siberia in the north, Asia in the west, and across Europe in the northwest. The breadth of the territory was unprecedented in Chinese dynasties. At that time, Europeans, seeing the great Chinese people of yellow race, were terrified! So they called the Chinese the Yellow Peril! Thinking back to now, being oppressed by strong neighbors everywhere, with the territory shrinking day by day and the national power weakening day by day, it is truly unbearable to look back!</p>
<p>Homophonous with Yellow Peril and now generally regarded as a major disaster is the [Yellow River], which is currently experiencing severe floods. According to a survey by Heping News Agency, the affected area totals 34,432 square kilometers, with as many as 27 affected areas. The people are starving everywhere, and the cries are shaking the sky. Adults and gentlemen are running around, busy with disaster relief and damming breaches. Newspapers also carry lengthy reports every day. This Yellow River flood, this Yellow Peril, is simply several times more terrible than the Yellow Peril of Genghis Khan straddling Asia and Europe!</p>
<p>In fact, the word [Yellow] itself is somewhat scary. A rural scholar, when deciphering this word, said, "One, two, one mu of land, planted with eight handfuls of seedlings." Just imagine, 21 mu of land, planted with only eight handfuls of seedlings, the capacity of these eight handfuls of seedlings is also quite large. Furthermore, during the Qing Dynasty, all officials such as grand ministers of the Imperial Guard and commanders of the Imperial Guard had to wear yellow jackets. When the emperor went on inspection tours, he was escorted in a carriage, with shouts and entourages in front and behind, to enhance the spectacle. In addition, civil and military ministers, either for hitting the target in the great archery competition or for meritorious service in battle, were also specially awarded yellow jackets. How majestic were these yellow jackets!</p>
<h3>Eating</h3>
<p>— Xing Guangyi</p>
<p>The most troublesome thing in running a school is not how to improve teaching methods or curriculum, but the turmoil in the dining hall, which is all about eating.</p>
<p>Foreigners offer wreaths to the dead, but Chinese ghosts must eat. Sometimes the rice bowl after death is more important than when alive. Therefore, there is the Confucian ethic of "There are three unfilial acts, of which having no descendants is the greatest," probably because they are afraid of not having cold pork to eat after death! Not only ghosts have to eat, but gods also have to eat. Foreigners perform rituals for gods, which can be said to be idealism. Chinese people are materialistic towards gods, which may be advocating Marxism!</p>
<p>Foreigners' greetings are always asking "Good morning," "Good afternoon," and "Good evening," but Chinese people's social greetings are always asking "Have you had breakfast?" "Have you had lunch?" "Have you had dinner?" It seems that Chinese people are always thinking about eating from morning till night. In fact, the rice bowl problem is indeed more important than any other problem!</p>
<h3>Random Talk about Comics</h3>
<p>— Qian Yun (Writing), Dong Liang (Drawing)</p>
<p>...Terrifying Children's Education...</p>
<p>Rather than saying that general writers or painters are irresponsible, it is better to frankly and clearly state that they are forced to write those irresponsible works for economic reasons, for food, with gods and monsters fully portrayed, confusing the minds of countless young Chinese citizens. After school, they eagerly go to street stalls to find those Flying Immortal Swordsmen, which cost one copper coin to rent. Each of these pamphlets often has eight to more than ten volumes. A generation of women with little knowledge also scramble to pass the time...harming them to dream of riding the clouds at night, and blowing chicken feather arrows with bamboo tubes during the day. Sure enough, children have the total sensitivity of children. Then, when a dry battery lights up, naturally...this is taken as the sword light emitted by the great hero!</p>
<p>Every child is like a tender seedling. To become great, it depends entirely on good education to nurture them. If children are always talking about and learning to spit flying swords, taking people's heads at will from a hundred miles away, how heartbroken should parents be that your children are so obsessed with these deeply imprinted monstrous images. To speak from a larger perspective...do you want to see all the young Chinese citizens spitting swords? If a thief has no food to eat, should we leave the back door open in advance at night?</p>
<h3>Mystery of Romance</h3>
<p>— Wang Ci</p>
<p>For several years, the call for popular literature has been very strong in the Chinese literary world. However, no matter how loud you shout, the masses are not able to reach it even with ladders. Three or four years ago, the masses were confused by the mysteries of "Proletariat" and "Bourgeoisie." A few months ago, with the arrival of George Bernard Shaw, they began to doubt the word "Humor"...Recently, there has been a popular thing called "Romance." These ingenious words make the masses feel "laughing and crying"!</p>
<p>In order to break the mystery of "Romance," I opened the English-Chinese dictionary and found the word Romance, which is explained as:</p>
<p>(1) Imaginative novel, biography, unofficial history, fictional story. (2) Events that can be regarded as novels, events of talented scholars and beautiful women, events of romance, love affairs. (3) Fiction, absurdity. (4) Delusion, infatuation, novel mind...</p>
<p>After reading it, I breathed a sigh of relief for the masses and couldn't help but feel something. I humbly hope that domestic literary giants who have returned from overseas will write fewer "Romances," as well as words such as "Bolshevik" and "Romantic" when writing, so that the masses can easily understand them, then the merit will be greater than reciting "Amitabha" tens of millions of times! Even if you can't help it, I hope you will write a few more "Miss," "Mister," as well as "Non-umbrella," "Friend ABC," etc., because the masses can still reach these kinds of words even with ladders!</p>
<h3>In Orderly Fashion</h3>
<p>— Yiguan Owner</p>
<p>"In orderly fashion" can also be said to be "following order." If you want to use foreign language, you can also say [In Order]. However, I am Chinese, I eat Chinese food, and this article is written in Chinese, so it is still honest to say "in orderly fashion," which is both elegant and popular, and known to women and children.</p>
<p>It is said, but I don't know who said it? "In orderly fashion" is what fair-haired and blue-eyed foreigners pay most attention to. Black-haired and black-eyed Chinese people are at a loss. I am just a Chinese, so at first I was furious when I heard this, feeling that it was too欺人! I thought that fair-haired and blue-eyed foreigners and black-haired and black-eyed Chinese people, although different in color, [carry their heads on their shoulders], are the same. Why do foreigners know how to pay attention to [in orderly fashion], but Chinese people don't know how to pay attention to [in orderly fashion]? Aren't these words too condescending to us Chinese?</p>
<p>However, thinking about it carefully, why be angry? The facts are right in front of us. Look, as soon as a ship docks, the passengers in the cabin, like a swarm of bees, all seem to be familiar with [swimming skills], not afraid of accidentally falling into the water. What women and children are the weak, everyone does not know. They only know to rush to the shore first, which is really good-looking! If a car arrives, the chaotic pushing and shoving is as lively as when the ship arrives, very interesting! As for other places, such as train stations or movie theaters, everyone is fighting for tickets, and everyone wants to be first. So, those with great strength come from behind. Those with little strength have to sigh while looking at the change. Alas! Facts like this, not knowing how to pay attention to [in orderly fashion], can indeed be seen everywhere in China, which is undeniable.</p>
<p>Originally, to observe whether a country's politics is on the right track and whether everything in society is sound, just look at whether its citizens are [in orderly fashion] everywhere? And you can find out. It seems that our country's politics is not on the right track, and society is a mess. Looking at the citizens everywhere who do not know how to pay attention to [in orderly fashion], maybe this is one of the many reasons?</p>
<h3>Northeast Four Company Commanders</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Sour Feelings and Breast Complaints in Front of Us Are Still Blessings; Busy Military Horses Secretly Transfer Troops</p>
<p>Yin Deren patted him on the shoulder and said, "Don't think so foolishly. We have to follow the orders quickly. If you sit here and worry, it's all in vain. Being a company commander is still being a company commander, and leaving is still leaving. If things are delayed and cannot be done, it will be even more terrible. Why bother?" Zhao Ziqiang thought about it and his words were correct. He had no choice but to cheer up and tell the sergeant Wang Shili to quickly make the tables and send them to the battalion headquarters that day. He still talked to Yin Deren privately, wondering how many days it would be before he left. Yin Deren said, "Don't look at them urging the tables so urgently, it's all a cover-up. With this table, the subsidy will come down from the headquarters based on this number. If the departure is delayed by one day, our boss will get a lot of benefits from it, why not delay it for a few more days? So if you have anything to do, don't worry, just take your time to do it. I don't think we'll be leaving in five days." Zhao Ziqiang put his hands in his trouser pockets and turned around in the room several times, talking to himself, "This matter is really embarrassing for me. Should I tell my old man right away? Or should I tell him when I'm about to leave?" Yin Deren smiled and said, "As the saying goes, an honest official can hardly judge family affairs, we can't give random advice on this matter. Looking at this matter, wouldn't it be better for us to be single?" Zhao Ziqiang felt even more confused after hearing his words and walked back and forth in the room non-stop. This day, he hesitated and couldn't find time to go back. Because the battalion headquarters urged the making of the tables several times in one day, there was no way but to rush to make the tables in the afternoon and send them away. The next morning, the regimental headquarters called and summoned the battalion and company commanders to a meeting. Zhao Ziqiang felt even more that the time of departure must be imminent as soon as he got this news. (208)</p>
<p>Children's Paradise</p>
<h3>Fairy Tale: The Valley of the Great Serpent</h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>At the foot of Mount Kuaiji, there was a very small lumber village. In the village lived a hunter and a woodcutter. The hunter was named Wang Si, and the woodcutter was named Zhang San. Both of these people were very lazy, but they were both getting rich, fantasizing about getting rich all day long. One day, the two of them were talking about how to get rich when an old man happened to come along. The old man heard their conversation and smiled at them, saying, "If you want to get rich, why don't you go to the mountains over there? I've heard people say that there are many gold, silver, and treasures in the valley over there. These treasures were hidden by a wealthy man who fled to the valley during the Taiping Rebellion. However, these treasures are not easy to retrieve because there is a large serpent guarding the valley entrance. In the past, people who went to search for treasure were bitten to death by the serpent, so in recent decades, no one has dared to go there again." Wang Si and Zhang San replied in unison, "That's easy. We both have knives, axes, guns, and bullets, so we're not afraid of any ferocious beasts or snakes. If this is true, we're willing to sacrifice our lives. Please, old man, tell us where the treasure is." The old man said to them, "Pass over the ridge of this mountain, then turn right, and go forward about fifty or sixty steps. There are more than twenty large pine trees. To the north of the pine forest, there is a deep valley. That valley is where the great serpent guards the treasure." Wang Si and Zhang San were overjoyed when they heard these words. They hurriedly bid farewell to the old man and rushed up the mountain. As they walked, they said, "If we get the treasure, we should divide it equally and not secretly cheat each other." The two of them swore an oath to heaven. Before long, they saw a pine forest ahead. They came to the north of the pine forest, where mist was everywhere. They searched all over the ground and, sure enough, saw a deep valley. The two were overjoyed. They each prepared their guns and knives and bravely entered the valley. After walking about twenty or thirty feet, they discovered countless gold ingots and silver bars. The two of them were ecstatic, staring at each other in a daze. Wang Si said to Zhang San, "The old man said that there was a great serpent guarding this place, but we haven't encountered anything blocking our way since we entered the valley. I really don't understand it." Zhang San said, "That old man wanted to monopolize the treasure here and deliberately deceived us." Wang Si said, "Let's quickly transport these treasures out." Zhang San, seeing so much treasure, suddenly had a wicked thought. He wanted to get all the treasure in the cave for himself, so he said to Wang Si, "Look at so much treasure. The two of us can't carry it all back. Please go home first, prepare the food, and then bring the donkey. I'll pack up the gold and silver here. When you bring the donkey, we can load it on its back together at the valley entrance." Wang Si said, "If you're here alone, what will happen if the great serpent comes out?" Zhang San said, "I have a large axe with me, so you can rest assured. Your gun and bullets are here, and you can use them to defend against the serpent if it comes." Wang Si agreed and left. When he arrived home, he had another wicked thought. He ate his own meal first, then put poison in the food that was meant for Zhang San, thinking to himself, "Zhang San, you dog thief, your fate is in my hands now." He hurriedly led the donkey up the mountain. At this time, Zhang San was waiting for Wang Si under the pine forest. Seeing Wang Si walking halfway up the mountain, he quickly aimed and fired the gun. With a bang, Wang Si died from the bullet. Zhang San saw that Wang Si was dead, so he walked to Wang Si's side, led the donkey to the valley entrance, and sat alone on a stone, laughing loudly, "All these treasures are mine now, and I'll enjoy them for the rest of my life." As he spoke, he unwrapped the food from the donkey's back and devoured it ravenously. Just as he was about to get up to transport the gold and silver, he suddenly experienced severe abdominal pain, was poisoned, fell to the ground, and died. This cycle of retribution all stemmed from insatiable greed and mutual jealousy. Harming others harms oneself. It is truly a satisfying story.</p>

<h3>Financial: American Silver, Prices Fall; Gold Market Stable, Up Slightly by Two Cents; Foreign Telegrams Initially Grim, Then Favorable; Market Fluctuates and Rebounds</h3>
<p>The gold market remained stable yesterday, with a relatively calm outlook. The morning began with the overseas silver market showing an increase in London and a decrease in the U.S., with fluctuating exchange rates. The forward silver price at the Metal Exchange decreased by between 1.5 and 3 cents. London spot gold decreased by 3.5 pence. The price of new U.S. mined gold was $31.50, slightly down by 2.4 cents from the previous day. Stocks fell by 5.5 cents, U.S. cotton decreased by 20 points, and U.S. wheat decreased by 1.5 cents. The market opened lower due to a Reuters telegram reporting that President Roosevelt would return from New York to Washington today, with new developments in the recovery situation, but then fell. However, the situation stabilized slightly after Senator Robinson, a Democrat, declared that inflation would hinder the recovery movement, and that the dollar price should be reset and prices strictly adjusted. The opening situation was flat, with HSBC postings unchanged, resulting in no upward or downward movement. Subsequently, due to strong bank appetite, the Bank of East Asia and the Bank of Communications bought up U.S. dollars. Foreign telegrams stated that the U.S. indicated a fixed gold standard at the war debt conference, driving prices up to over $80. The market then fell again, and the market was quiet, with Guangdong banks supplying the market. Raw gold was priced at $1,120. The Double Tenth Gold Exchange will also be closed for one day. Today's market conditions will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was $779.60, down $1.90 from the previous closing. Goods opened at $9.70. The exchange market opened with near-term selling prices of 1 shilling and 3.5 pence for British pounds and $30.6875 for U.S. dollars. The market was very stable in the first ten minutes, hovering steadily. The market then retreated to $778.50 due to news that HSBC postings were unchanged. The Yokohama Specie Bank bought January U.S. dollars at 31.125 and remained stable. Yung Feng, Yuan Hsing, and Yung Hong Lee all entered the market, while the Bank of East Asia bought December U.S. dollars at 31.125 and 30.0625. Mitsui then bought January U.S. dollars at 31.125, pushing prices up to $81. The Yokohama Specie Bank sold December U.S. dollars to HSBC at 30.0625. With the supply of goods and Bing Hsing, the price retreated to $779.50 and then rebounded. Later, as settlements tightened, the Yokohama Specie Bank sought to settle January U.S. dollars at $2. Heng Yu, Chi Feng, Yung Fu, and Yu all entered the market around $82. Although the Central Exchange Company sold January U.S. dollars at 31.25 to Mitsui, Bing Hsing sold aggressively at the same time, causing a slight struggle. However, due to strong demand from banks for December at 31.125 and January at 31.25, Han Heng, Heng Yu, Cheng Chang, Yi Feng, Yung Da Hsing, Yung Yuan Heng, and others jointly entered the market, pushing prices up to $784. The noon closing price was $783.60 after some fluctuations. Goods were priced at $783.50.</p>

Yi Da, Yung Fu, Yu Tong, and Yi and others slightly bought, pulling prices up $1.12, due to Macquarie buying January U.S. dollars at 31.125.

<h3>The Financial Industry's Market Vigor is Gradually Developing</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the financial industry's market atmosphere was quite prosperous and thriving. Not only were the banks busy with collections and disbursements, but also the circulation of various commodities was more extensive than usual. Therefore, financial circulation naturally increased. Yesterday, the silver and money industries experienced a slight uptick in business. The price of foreign exchange in the market remained the same. The early and noon markets were both at 9 cents.

<h3>Copper Coins Decrease Another 2,500 Cash</h3>
<p>—Jiangnan and Guangdong Prices Stable—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading volume of Jiangnan small silver coins was sparse in both the early and noon markets, so the market price did not fluctuate much. The closing price was the same at 837 yuan, down 5 cents from the previous day's noon market. The trading volume of small transactions was 9,500 small dollars in the early market, and there were no transactions in the noon market. The Guangdong small silver coin price was 786.7 yuan in the early market and 786.2 yuan in the noon market. As a result, it was only 4 cents better than the previous noon. The trading volume was 45,000 small dollars in the early market and 65,000 small dollars in the noon market.

<h3>Securities and Bond Market: Many Forward Transactions</h3>
<p>—Decreases Outnumber Increases, with Slight Margins—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market in the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was stable but slightly chaotic. Trading by large firms was scarce, while buying and selling by retail investors was quite lively. Observation of the market's sentiment still showed a firm uptrend, as buyers were still in a besieged state, and bulls slightly liquidated their positions, so the market price showed a slight fatigue. The opening price in the morning was generally flat and fatigued. In the middle of the day, due to forward transactions, such as the 1920s Relief Fund (一九善後) forward and the 20% Customs Surtax (廿關統稅), the prices were slightly better by 5 cents to 25 cents. The rest all decreased slightly by 5 cents to 12 cents. In the second session, except for the Disbandment Loan (編遣), which was slightly better by 5 cents or 1 cent, the others all decreased slightly by 5 cents to 3 cents. In the afternoon sessions, forward transactions were more common, and there were no significant gains or losses. As a result, the market price also showed mixed increases and decreases, with decreases generally outnumbering increases, but the numbers were small, not exceeding 5 cents to 15 cents. The trend may not be easy to fall sharply, as the accumulated number is huge, and there are also many floating positions. There may be a period of consolidation in the near future. The total transaction volume was 5,858,000 yuan, including 8,000 yuan in spot goods, 1,960,000 yuan in forward consolidated salt tax, 845,000 yuan in the Disbandment Loan, 625,000 yuan in the 1920s Customs Fund, 1,450,000 yuan in the 20% Broadcast Customs Fund, 450,000 yuan in the 96 Bond, and the rest were only tens of thousands to over ten thousands.

<h3>New York Stock Market Slightly Declines</h3>
<p>New Feng Yang Line reports: On the 6th, the New York stock market was dull and slightly declined because speculators could not stimulate the market. Previous rumors that Washington would have good news about currency and lending conditions failed to materialize, causing great disappointment. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 1,660,000. [Wheat] prices fell due to light trading. [Cotton] prices were flat and featureless because speculators lacked interest, Southern parties sold, and there was no good absorption. The talk of currency stabilization was becoming more prevalent, and the cotton production report was imminent, so everyone was in a wait-and-see bearish attitude. [Silver] market closed steadily. The U.S. Treasury Department's gold price was $31.55 per ounce. The Dow Jones Index is listed below.</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn and Flowers: American Cotton Price Fall Affects Standard Yarn Flowers</h3>
<p>The yarn market is becoming fatigued, and the price fall is even more intense because 20 strands of Indian yarn (人鐘) and Fuguisha yarn are being delivered to warehouses, and one party is selling forward on the futures market. As a result, people's hearts are even more empty, and a selling frenzy has suddenly arisen. However, the bulls of a certain factory are still buying and adding to their positions. Actual demand is still good. The future situation is very uncertain.</p>
<h3>The Atmosphere of Spot Cotton is Vigorous</h3>
<p>The spot cotton market opened with a weakness in popularity due to the downward trend in American cotton, with each month falling by $1.10 to $1.30.

<p>Shantou 50, Jiangxi 75, Guangdong 945, Changsha 40, Ningbo 5</p>
<p>The cotton market has turned down because American cotton has fallen. People's hearts are slightly softened. Some bulls have closed out their profits, but the weather is still bad, and shipments from various routes are affected, so the idea of seeing higher prices has not been abandoned. There was a heavy rain in Hankou, and that bank also made some purchases. The sales channels for existing cotton can still be maintained.</p>
<h3>The Price of Standard Flowers in Each Month Decreased by Four and a Half Cents</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard market opened, and the market atmosphere changed due to the poor performance of American flowers. Buyers were lacking, and each month fell by 4.5 cents to 3.5 cents.

<h3>Grain: Rice Shipments to He Xia Significantly Increase After the Holiday</h3>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 30 sources, and the market continued to show vigor. Recently, due to the small amount of inventory in stores before the festival, they are now preparing to purchase successively after the holiday. Therefore, the opening market was very active. Later, due to the limited number of arriving ships, the price has been seeing increase. Although the guest banks have not moved, it has no impact. There was no sign of any decline until the close. However, the market prices of various goods varied. The price of each broken indica rice (破粳) rose by about 2 cents, while the price of thin rice was higher by about 1 to 2 cents. Each new tip rice (新尖) was slightly better by a cent. The price of kiln-dried Baige and other types also increased by more than a cent. Yin Yuan (陰元) is still popular, while Bian Yuan (變元) has no market.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday, there were 31 or 2 sources in He Xia. All kinds of destiations were weak. However, the shipment of broken indica rice continued, and the market price for medium-grade white broken indica rice was close to one foot higher. The medium-grade new indica rice showed a slight tightening trend. The prices of new and old Yangdu customer tips (羊杜客尖), group tips (團尖), water chestnut tips (茭白尖), and other types did not fluctuate much. The kiln type of thin indica rice (薄粳窰種) was close to one foot. Dongxin indica rice (東新粳) increased by another 2 cents.</p>
<h3>Inferior Rice Weak and Declining in Price</h3>
<p>—High-Quality Rice Sales Decreasing—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of inferior rice declined because a large number of rice carts arrived in Shanghai, the inventory was full, and sales were not as brisk as before. Consequently, the various grades of middle and inferior rice generally fell in price. Rice of above-average quality was sought after by merchants from Fujian, Guangdong, and local businesses, maintaining a stable market. However, the provinces of Guangdong are now directly procuring from Hunan and Anhui, and these regions are also planning to transport as much rice as possible to Shanghai. Therefore, the future market conditions for inferior rice are difficult to predict. It is hoped that sales will increase in Fujian, Zhejiang, and locally, and that new markets in Northern China can be developed to sustain the upward trend. Yesterday, Fujian merchants purchased 700 bags of processed rice for transport to Beijing, and over 300 bags of coarse Jing rice from Hunan. Local businesses sold 500 bags of coarse rice to Nanjing, along with a small amount of Hunan coarse rice. Ningbo merchants only purchased 100 bags of late-season processed rice from Jiangxi. Shantou showed slight interest in Hunan coarse rice, with late-season Jiangxi rice selling for 7.45 yuan, and Hunan coarse rice selling for 5.75 to 5.45 yuan. Nanjing processed rice sold for 6.65 to 6.49 yuan, and coarse rice for 5.45 to 5.38 yuan.</p>
<h3>Flour Auction Suspended for Margin Call Issues; Today's Auction Depends on Negotiation Results</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market exchange was forced to suspend auctions due to margin call issues. With the price of flour falling sharply, there were concerns that both long and short positions were at risk. The exchange is currently gathering flour merchants to discuss ways to maintain stability. Whether the market will open today depends on the outcome of the margin call negotiations before the auction can resume as usual.</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat Active, Si Wheat Falling</h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw a generally quiet opening in the morning for all months. The price of foreign wheat from Chicago fell by about 45 cents, while Canadian wheat fell by a smaller amount. Consequently, market sentiment was generally flat. Distant months were particularly weak due to unfavorable conditions. In the afternoon, the market saw a sharp decline across all months. Foreign wheat sellers were extremely active, offering wheat to factories at a price that fell to 4.35 yuan. However, factories were hesitant to accept due to the stagnation of flour sales. The atmosphere of foreign dumping had filled the market, causing distant months to fall even further. As a result, the current month fell by 5 cents compared to the previous day, November fell by 5 cents, December fell by 7 cents, January fell by 7 cents, February fell by 9 cents, and March fell by 14 cents. The current wheat market is not active, and most factories have no appetite. Only Fuxin is engaging in some trading, mostly in medium and inferior grades at cheap prices. Gao You wheat is selling for 3.75 yuan, Tong wheat for 3.75 yuan, Daqiao wheat for 3.72 yuan, and Lujin wheat for 3.70 yuan, totaling over 4,000 bags.</p>
<p>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk Prices Plummet</p>
<h3>Lyon Raw Silk Declines Another Franc</h3>
<p>According to reliable information from the Sin孚 Foreign Firm, the Lyon raw silk market has been weakened by the massive dumping of Japanese silk, making it difficult for Chinese silk prices to hold. White filature A-grade silk (including brands such as Golden Double Deer and Golden Silver Cat) is now only 91 francs per kilogram, a drop of one franc compared to Friday. When converted to Chinese currency, the price is only slightly above 900 yuan per bale.</p>
<h3>Export of Yellow Silk Waste to Germany Languishes</h3>
<p>Sales of yellow silk waste to Germany have been sluggish for a long time, and exports are dwindling. Yesterday, the German postal ship sailed from Shanghai to Hamburg, carrying only 54 pieces of Jiangbei tail silk and Sichuan scarves from firms such as Fulaide.</p>
<h3>Silk Sales to Europe and America Lacking Vigor</h3>
<p>Recently, labor strikes have spread among silk weaving factories in New York and other places, leading to a decrease in raw silk consumption. General hoarders are actively competing to sell their stocks. The dumping of Japanese silk in Lyon and England continues unabated, causing silk prices to plummet. Telegraphic silk prices are also falling. New York B-grade filature is priced at only 620.30 yuan, making it even more difficult for factories to sell. The market is quiet. Yesterday, only Dafeng and others imported 30 bales of yellow and white filature, with prices continuing to decline.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: About 200 Bags of Green Sugar Traded</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight decrease in customs gold and a slight increase in Dutch exchange rates, leading to a trend towards stabilization. The Association's clearing price for 24-grade sand white ordinary goods was 21.58 yuan, with some transactions. 20-grade medium sand was quoted at 20.9 yuan, 18-grade at 20.7 yuan, high-grade Dutch red sugar MKGB was quoted at 16.9 yuan, and NT mark at 10.6 yuan, but no transactions occurred. China Guohua Zhenji No. 1 cotton white was quoted at 20.6 yuan, and Taikoo B mark at 21.65 yuan. Chaozhou firms quoted village green sugar at 16 yuan, followed by 15.8 to 15.3 yuan, totaling over 100 bags. Jianbang firms offered 100 bags of oily package green sugar at 14.7 yuan. The inventory of high-grade Chaozhou green sugar is not large, and land prices are relatively firm, leading to a tightening of prices.</p>
<h3>Dried and Fresh Produce: Some Quanzhou Large Longans Sold</h3>
<p>The first batch of Quanzhou large blister longans, which arrived recently via Jianbang, was displayed yesterday. Top-grade large-sized goods are priced at around 80 yuan, with subsequent grades varying by 23 to 45 yuan. However, the lower grades face competition from other routes, making it difficult to develop and sell well. It is expected that sales will continue today.</p>
<h3>Metals: Union Iron Oversupply</h3>
<p>The Union Iron has recently been overstocked with new arrivals, but sales are limited, leading to an oversupply. Standards are gradually being relaxed, and the current market price is only 30 yuan, a decrease of 5 cents compared to before. It is rumored that large-scale transactions can be made for about 1 yuan cheaper.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Asphalt Trend Weakening Daily</h3>
<p>The asphalt market has been unusually sluggish since autumn, with the largest stockpiles in Hankou. For example, the total amount of Macheng oil is over 10,000 pieces, and the total amount of Chongjing, Pingjing, Zhijiang, and Jinshi oil is over 30,000 pieces. However, sales are only sporadic. Soap factories are not interested in asphalt because beef tallow and coconut oil are cheaper. The amount used by candle makers is extremely limited. As a result, many merchants from Jing, Xuan, Zhi, Jin, and Ma are transporting oil to Hankou for sale, leading to a larger stockpile in Hankou than in spring and summer. In previous years, the old oil would gradually sell out as new oil was about to be produced in autumn, but now the stockpile in Hankou is larger, making it inevitable that the market will fall sharply. The repeated price drops in the past month are due to this. Recently, the Mid-Autumn Festival has been busy with settling accounts, further reducing transactions. Although the stockpiles in Jiangsu and Zhejiang are relatively thin, it is unlikely that they will be sold out before the new production. Therefore, Hankou's hope for sales to Jiangsu and Zhejiang is fading. It is rumored that Chongjing oil in Hankou is only selling for 20 yuan, and Macheng oil may not be able to hold at 19 yuan. The trend of prices plummeting is obvious. However, there may be some candle sales after the Mid-Autumn Festival, which may help to stabilize the market. Local merchants already have limited stockpiles, but due to sluggish sales, they have to further reduce prices to stimulate interest from candle makers. The listed price for Chongjing oil is 24.5 yuan per dan, Pingjing oil is 24 to 23.5 yuan, and Macheng oil is 22.5 yuan per dan. However, these prices are nominal, and the actual prices are falling in secret. The disparity between listed and actual prices is a common practice due to the poor market conditions.</p>
<h3>Light-skinned Peanut Oil Plunges One Yuan</h3>
<p>After the price drops in Jia Cang, Boer, and Jiaozhou peanut oil, light-skinned peanut oil has not been traded for over a month because buyers are not interested and the stockpiles are small. The market is stagnant for both peanut and soybean oil. Therefore, sellers are selling 300 pieces of light-skinned peanut oil at a low price to boost market confidence. The price is 13.1 yuan, a sharp drop of over one yuan compared to the previous closing price.</p>

<p>Fashion Special Issue, No. 5</p>
<h3>Fashion and Its Economic Impact: Peculiar Interests, Wild Decorations</h3>
<p>— Xu Yunshou</p>
<p>Fashionable clothing and luxurious decorations have become almost essential for a modern woman. Styles, colors, and patterns change rapidly and constantly, making them unpredictable. People do not know their origins, nor where they are going. Women who love fashion only know what is popular and what to wear, without knowing why. However, society is becoming increasingly extravagant and Westernized due to the changes in fashion, which has sparked countless praises and criticisms. Therefore, discussing this issue is of interest today.</p>
<p>On the surface, it seems like a simple problem, but a detailed study reveals endless difficulties. I have not researched this topic, but I will discuss it based on the views of others for clarity, I will divide the discussion into three parts:</p>
<p>(1) What is fashion?</p>
<p>(2) How is fashion created?</p>
<p>(3) The economic impact of fashion</p>
<p>We can say that fashion is a habitual need for change. It is dynamic, never fixed, and unimportant. It makes people unaware of the changes in the most trivial patterns and shapes. The French Voltaire once said:</p>
<p>It is a beautiful woman without constancy, without habit, and without peace.</p>
<p>Peculiar are its interests, wild are its decorations.</p>
<p>It seems to have fled, but it still returns slowly, always living forever.</p>
<p>Its father is the indecisive, and its name is fashion.</p>
<p>We must admit that humans are slaves to fashion. Fashion follows human whims and is the most unreasonable and chaotic medium for new patterns.</p>
<h3>Hard Collars on Qipao</h3>
<p>In fact, fashion is as old as the world, and also eternally new if we look back. However, the return is only a modified appearance. To verify this, we only need to compare the Manchu qipao with modern women's clothing to understand. Even the high and hard collars currently in fashion are similar to the ingot collars of twenty years ago. Despite this, women's fashion is extremely complex and elusive. It does not obey rules, nor is it subject to laws. We can summarize fashion in the words of Virgil:</p>
<p>Happy is the one who knows the causes of things.</p>
<p>In fact, fashion has its own principles, but the truth is not recognized.</p>
<h3>Bare Arms, Exposed Legs, and High Heels</h3>
<p>So how is fashion created?</p>
<p>The history of fashion throughout the ages often points out that trivial reasons, changes, and accidental events often involve a fashion that spreads throughout the world, leaving special and permanent traces in history. Sometimes the appearance of fashion is often caused by the eccentricity of a princess, the entertainment of a queen, or by a drama or political change, as in the following examples:</p>
<p>King Louis XI of France's daughter created long clothes that dragged on the feet because her feet were too big.</p>
<p>The beautiful Ferronnicre had a burn scar in the middle of her forehead, so she wore a jewel attached to a thin thread to cover the scar.</p>
<p>Queen Anne of Austria, whose arms were extremely white and full, created the fashion of bare-armed, sleeveless clothes.</p>
<p>Madame de Pampadour, with her graceful waist, created high-heeled slippers without backs.</p>
<p>In China, the change of dynasties brought about changes in clothing. Not to mention the recent success of the revolution, which led to the popularity of the Zhongshan suit. With the names of curvy beauty and others, close-fitting, leg-revealing clothes came into being. At the same time, women wore high-heeled leather shoes and permed their hair.</p>
<h3>Autumn Style New Crepe Gui and Pleated Qipao</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xuanxiang</p>
<p>I have never relied entirely on tailors for my clothing, nor have I wished to imitate the fashionable clothing of the moment, because women's clothing in Shanghai was often first created by prostitutes, and the ladies and misses would imitate them.</p>
<p>Autumn clothes are the most difficult, because there will be wind and rain, especially at night, when it is relatively cool. Therefore, it is difficult to make clothes that are both beautiful and suitable for the weather.</p>
<p>In the autumn when it is cool but not cold, it seems too early to carry an autumn coat, and it also does not seem very beautiful to wear a woolen half-sleeve.</p>
<p>Now I have made a set of clothes for myself, one called "Gui" (i.e., short cape) and the other is an ordinary qipao, with slight changes. The qipao is made of silk crepe, with very long sleeves, but the cuffs are all made of elastic bands so that they can be hung under the shoulders (like the sleeves of this year's popular women's suits). Because the slits in the dress are very long, it is too cool and not elegant. So, I chose plain chiffon of a similar color to the silk crepe and intricately pleated it into the dress's slits, making the hem of the dress particularly wide, so that it is starry and stylish when walking.</p>
<p>The "Gui" is made of double-layered satin, and it is also unlined. The double-layer is the same on the front and back, one side is red and the other side is black. Either side can be used as the front or back. A three-and-a-half-inch long ribbon is sewn on the collar, which can be wrapped around the neck and used as a scarf, hanging on the back or chest, there is no problem. If the weather is a little warmer, it can be taken off and placed on the arm, which is not annoying. If the weather is a little colder, or at night, it can be worn, which is very beautiful. Since I made it and wore it, many girlfriends and sisters have imitated it. I think it is not vulgar at all, and the style is very dignified and noble, without any frivolity, and it is so beautiful.</p>
<p>。</p>
<h3>Pleated Pants and Military Uniform Coat</h3>
<p>However, modern Europe and America are slightly different. Almost all fashion is created and packaged by a few large sewing shops. There are also many fashion companies in Shanghai now, most of which still copy European and American samples. These stores hire specialized talents to come up with designs, and then have model women wear them to promote them to the public, like the Shanghai Fashion Conference; or they promote them through advertisements, magazines, theaters, movies, and extravagant banquets. The world-famous fashion magazine Vogue can also be bought in Shanghai. It previews the materials, colors, and strange styles of each season's fashion.</p>
<p>At this point, we will have the following question again: Where do these people who specialize in creating fashion get their inspiration? In fact, there are many sources that influence their imagination. First of all, it is the current facts, special events, wars, etc., that can form a certain fashion or a certain fashion's incarnation. Therefore, during the Louis-Philippe era, all the fashionable young men in Paris wanted to wear pleated pants, like African hunters. Even the Westernization of men's clothing in China in recent years has been influenced by Europe and America to some extent. Some fashions are also inspired by literature; for example, wearing Atapa collars and Marie-stuart brimless hats. Romanticism has expressed special characteristics, that is, restoring national customs and medieval styles. For example, in gold and silver filigree, jewelry has become Gothic, with thick iron hand rings, guards wearing towering moth hair hats, helmets, coats of arms, shields, medals, and the entire feudal manufacturing bureau, all made of gold, silver, carving, and enamel. Recently, the newspaper also reported that Cubists were wearing strangely shaped hats in Rome. And in China, since last winter, the style of women's coats has been the same as that of military officers' coats, with many yellow and white copper buttons sewn on the front and back. At least, like the beautiful clothes of Hifer in the film The Merry Widow, I think it is also influenced by the two wars of [September 18th] [January 28th], and women also have the imagination of joining the army. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>The Elimination of Cotton Clothing</h3>
<p>— A Thread</p>
<p>Ten years ago, women all wore short clothes, and in early winter, they had to wear cotton-padded clothes. The more elaborate ones were sewn into various patterns with thread. The five auspicious clothes given by Suzhou when betrothing, cotton-padded, lined, unlined gauze, cotton-padded clothes were indispensable. Since the evolution of the qipao, cotton-padded clothes have gradually been eliminated. Because cotton-padded clothes are always a little bloated, no matter how little they are lined. Instead, they are replaced by flannel and camel hair.</p>
<p>Flannel is naturally the most fitting. If the weather is cool but not cold, or if it is suddenly cold or suddenly hot, single-layered clothes are too shabby, and camel hair is too warm, so flannel is the most suitable. In deep winter, leather is too heavy, so camel hair must be used. From an economic point of view, these two are also the most cost-effective.</p>
<p>There are also lined clothes, which are cheaper than flannel, and you can line faded or old clothes, and their effect is comparable to flannel.</p>
<p>In this way, cotton-padded clothes have to retreat. However, in evening makeup, in the boudoir, taking off the long clothes and putting on a delicate short cotton-padded jacket or a thin cotton-padded half-sleeve is very poetic. Bai Juyi's poem: [Gui cloth is as white as snow, Wu cotton is as soft as clouds, the cloth is heavy and the cotton is thick, and the fur has residual warmth.] It can be seen that cotton-padded clothes are much better than leather clothes. Therefore, I think that cotton-padded clothes are not suitable for external wear, but suitable for internal wear, and should not be completely eliminated.</p>
<h3>Color Matching Method for Modern Women's Clothing</h3>
<p>— Yixiang</p>
<p>(Continued)</p>
<p>White (Primary Color)</p>
<p>White is the purest of all colors, simple and dignified, clean and beautiful, and free from worldly dust. Because it is the highest grade in color, it is also the ancestor of colors. Therefore, European and American ladies use it for their clothes in summer and autumn, taking its cleanliness and superiority, and not staining the dust. Moreover, the accompanying color should be bright and beautiful, because cleanliness with beauty is like a lotus emerging from the water, which is more beautiful. The suitable accompanying colors are listed below:</p>
<p>(Suitable Accompanying Colors) Blue, Rose Red, Han Yellow, Black-Blue</p>
<p>Black (Primary Color)</p>
<p>Black is the most沉of all colors, its容is静穆, its meaning is深濃, occupying the most important position in color. Therefore, European and American ladies like to make it into clothes, because it is elegant and appropriate, and has a generous attitude. However, since the正色is沉, its佐色must be凈, in order to match the position of guest and host, the more brilliant it looks.</p>
<p>(Suitable Accompanying Colors) Red, Blue, White, Gray, Blue-Violet</p>
<p>Dark Gray (Belongs to Black)</p>
<p>Pattern of double-layered winter coat fabric woven from Genuine Camel Hair by Zhanghua</p>
<p>Dark gray is not stained with dust, so it is often used for everyday clothes. Its color matching is as follows:</p>
<p>(Suitable Accompanying Colors) Blue, Rose Red, Blue</p>
<p>Gray (Belongs to Black)</p>
<p>Gray is also one of the mature colors, dignified and elegant, so people often like to use it. The color matching is as follows:</p>
<p>(Suitable Accompanying Colors) Blue-Violet, Rose Red, Light Blue, Light Purple</p>

<h3>Home Daily Update Association and Clothing Standards</h3>
<p>— Yangfen</p>
<p>Three years ago, in order to improve the clothing problem, the members of the Home Daily Update Association held a meeting at Mr. Shi Liangcai's residence to discuss. The members who attended the meeting:</p>
<p>24 male members, 40 female members, 15 male students, 21 female students. Among the 24 male members, one was over 60 years old, three were over 50 years old, seven were over 40 years old, five were over 30 years old, and eight were over 20 years old. Among the 40 female members, two were over 50 years old, five were over 40 years old, eleven were over 30 years old, and twenty-two were over 20 years old. The 36 male and female students were mostly between 15 and 20 years old. There were also some who were under 15 years old, I don't remember clearly. Most of the discussions were about four types: one was ordinary clothing, the second was Western clothing, the third was women's clothing, and the fourth was children's clothing. The standards of discussion were divided into four categories:</p>
<p>One quality material, domestic, economical.</p>
<p>Two forms, beautiful, brave.</p>
<p>Three colors, simple, elegant.</p>
<p>Four styles, flexible, applicable.</p>
<p>Among these many members of different ages, genders, thoughts, and concepts, these four standards were actually agreed upon, and everyone had no objection, which is really a rare thing. At that time, everyone also took a photo, because everyone was wearing cloth clothes, some people called it the cloth clothes conference. The clothing that each family created was exhibited, and some people interpreted it as a clothing exhibition. Everyone believed that a new era was opened in the family. At that time, the products of Hongxin Dyeing and Weaving Factory were actually outstanding, and won a lot of praise. I accidentally saw this record in my diary, and then I will explain the four standards:</p>
<p>In terms of one material, domestic fabrics can be said to have everything. Silk and satin should be pushed to Meiya, wool should be counted as Zhanghua, and cloth should be pushed to Hongxin, all of which are cheap and in line with economic principles.</p>
<p>In terms of two forms, beauty seems to have no standard, but the first is to avoid vulgarity, the second is to avoid anger, and the third is to avoid evil. The main goal is to be magnificent and healthy, and the lines can be called brave. I remember that Hongxin and Meiya spent a lot of research effort on this point.</p>
<p>In terms of three colors, the main goal is to be simple, plain, and elegant, and not to be extravagant, flamboyant, or charming. Once this goal is identified, then silk and satin are good, wool is good, and cloth is good. Hongxiang Company has a lot of old experience in this kind of color matching.</p>
<p>In terms of four styles, wool should be used for warmth, silk and satin should be used for lightness, and national cloth should be used for dignity and generosity. And the overall goal is to be flexible and suitable. Everyone knows that Hongxiang Company has put a lot of effort into this.</p>
<p>After this discussion, family clothing has been reformed a lot, and the easiest to see is:</p>
<p>One is that domestic goods have been adopted, and Meiya, Zhanghua, and Hongxin have done a lot of business.</p>
<p>Two, there are no more people wearing妖艶clothing.</p>
<p>Three children's clothing is all雄糾糾氣昂昂. The little old men with wide robes and large sleeves have actually disappeared from each family.</p>
<p>Four, each family's clothing has certain standards, and the cost of clothing for one year has been simplified, and the family economy has benefited greatly.</p>
<p>Now the small members of the Home Daily Update Association have grown up. Do you still remember the day of the discussion; were your little hands still raised very high?</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>What Separates Humans from Beasts</h3>
<p>— Zhi Li</p>
<p>The representatives of the Anti-War Association have already left Shanghai one after another. A certain English newspaper recently published a cartoon: a ship going out and a ship coming in. The ship going out was carrying several representatives of the Anti-War Association! People, while the ship coming in was loaded with lions, elephants, tigers, leopards - beasts.</p>
<p>Truly gratifying to the people's hearts. Fabricating something out of nothing, causing anxiety, what Marquis Marais and others have exited, let them go to [the Pacific Ocean] or [the bottom of the sea] to hold an [anti-war conference]! And this time, the German Hagenbeck Circus has arrived in Shanghai, world-renowned!</p>
<p>Shanghai is going to be very lively, and Shanghainese are going to be very happy, look, look!</p>
<p>War, why should we oppose it? Needless to say, the Twenty-Four Histories are a book of mutual slaughter. Even in the last ten years, what day have we not seen war? Being used to it, we have long been accustomed to it. As for saying it's scary, as long as the bombs don't fall on our heads, what's so scary about it? Who has ever felt scared watching Luo Tong and Pan Yang fight a great battle on stage? Moreover, that's so interesting! Ruskin didn't say, [War is the largest and most valuable kind of sport (Game) conducted by mankind.]? War is originally a Game, it's a Sport, that's such a happy thing! Who doesn't want to see the Spanish bullfight, who doesn't want to see the ancient Roman Gladiator? The Far East Games, the National and Provincial Games are already so lively, let alone the world war [spectacle]? Besides, when the First World War was happening, didn't we calmly sit on the sidelines, and didn't we become one of the victorious nations afterward?</p>
<p>War, why should we oppose it? Besides, the Hagenbeck Circus is not welcomed by the whole world? Inside are all lions, elephants, tigers, leopards, savage beasts. Are humans more savage than beasts? Is mankind's large-scale competition not as good as beasts' large-scale competition?</p>
<p>Go, you Marquis Marais and your group, go elsewhere!</p>
<p>Welcome, German Hagenbeck Circus!</p>
<p>Shanghai is going to be very lively, and Shanghainese are going to be very happy, look, look!</p>
<p>Mencius said, "[What separates humans from beasts is but a trifle]?"</p>
<p>Someone replied, "[It lies in one going out and one coming in]."</p>
<h3>On Liu Kezhuang's Poetry</h3>
<p>— He Ru</p>
<p>During the Southern Song Dynasty, there was the so-called Jianghu Poetry School. This was because a bookstore owner, Chen Qi, compiled and printed the Jianghu Collection, hence the name. Although this school of poets, like the Four Spirits School of poets at the same time, studied the late Tang Dynasty in poetry, they did not pay much attention to the refinement of words and sentences. They liked to write satirical poems and use recent events as poetic material. Moreover, some people used poetry to seek patronage and engage in self-promotion, severely exploiting others, such as Song Qianfu visiting Jia Sidao and obtaining 200,000 strings of paper money to build luxurious houses. These poets were truly worthy of being called "[traveling the Jianghu]"!</p>
<p>The famous Jianghu poets include Liu Kezhuang, Yue Lefa, Dai Fuguo, Ye Shaoweng, Liu Guo, Jiang Kui, and Fang Yue, among whom Liu Kezhuang's poetry is the most famous. Liu Kezhuang wrote many poems in his life, with the number between Lu You and Yang Wanli. He has his own poem to prove it:</p>
<p>Ode at Eighty (One of Ten Poems Recorded)</p>
<p>Cheng Weng only has four thousand poems, while Fang Weng nearly fills ten thousand. The old man has remnant brocade in his chest, asking Heaven to grant him Fang Weng's years. Originally, he greatly admired Yang Chengzhai and Lu Fangweng, and this is also proven by his poems:</p>
<p>Inscription on Fang Weng's Portrait</p>
<p>The Three Hundred Poems have been silent for a long time, and the nine thousand poems are all new.</p>
<p>Like the First Ancestor in Zen Buddhism, the only one since crossing the Yangtze River.</p>
<p>Inscription on Chengzhai's Portrait</p>
<p>A man beside Ouyang Gong's house, poetry outside the Lu Donglai school.</p>
<p>The world unanimously praises him as unparalleled, and a branch emerges from Jiangxi.</p>
<p>Even in his old age, he did not forget to catch up with Lu and Yang's status. His "Rising from Illness" poem says:</p>
<p>Since the changed customs, there has been no poetry in the world. Initially learning Xikun, I was ashamed of being pretentious. In old age, I am merely known as a minor figure, having once known the great masters. In a hundred years, I unknowingly have white hair at the temples. Who can sever countless whiskers? How many days will Chengzhai and Fangweng die? I will whip myself ten thousand times to follow them. His poems have two characteristics: one is that he likes to write six-character quatrains, and the other is that he likes to use stories from the current dynasty. Poets have always believed that using ancient events is better, but he prefers to use recent events that are familiar to everyone at the time. For example, "[Often mocking Jie Fu for implementing new laws, often hating Ou Gong for not reading books]." "[U Sou invited me to enter Zhen Shuai, but Guaiya would not admire a light carriage]." "[Kangjie's Book of Changes was passed down to hermits, and Lianxi learned it from eminent monks]." "[Villagers only know the beauty of celery soup, how can Prime Minister know the sweetness of eating bamboo shoots!] (Self-note: Fu Zheng Gong's affair)." These kinds of sentences can all be used as examples. He once had a line in a poem that said:</p>
<p>Worrying about the times is originally a poet's job,</p>
<p>Don't blame the many emotions in the poems.</p>
<p>This seems to be one of the reasons why he likes to use recent events in his poetry. However, he has endured criticisms such as "[poor quality of language, shallow and exposed meaning]" or "[glib and frivolous, the last of the Jianghu]."</p>
<h3>Records of Ancient Matters</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xue</p>
<p>If 1933 is said to be a year of national debt, then cool autumn September is also worth a "[month of ancient object revival]". Ancient objects, at any time are [striving to climb up] from the ashes (respectfully using Dr. Hu Shi's poem), why specifically add the word [revival] to this month? The original reason is that reviving the past seems to have formed a movement, and in recent months, even the air has a bit of an ancient flavor.</p>
<p>If you don't believe me, why not read the [Records of Ancient Matters] in cool autumn September:</p>
<p>(1) It says... Build a Confucius Temple, create a Classics School (Singapore, Reuters telegram).</p>
<p>(2) It says... Limit the use of brushes, boycott foreign stationery (Guangzhou, Reuters telegram).</p>
<p>(3) It says... Ancient tombs are discovered one after another (Nanchang, Shandong special telegram).</p>
<p>(4) It says... Golden marriage certificate, special release (Tianjin, Central News Agency telegram).</p>
<p>[How glorious and holy], a month's achievements are like this. If we continue to work hard in this way, [Han dynasty clothing] will not [become an ancient hill], and our [great nation] will truly have hope of revival. When I'm free and have nothing to do, I always feel happy thinking about this. It's not a fantasy. I think that the people at that time must have been wearing flowery clothes from the stage, swaggering on the official roads, bowing to people, and shouting loudly, "[Greetings, sir]". And when there was a love affair, it must have been that the hero dragged a shiny sword, strode onto the [Mandarin Duck Tower], and had a few more rounds of [blood splattering], so that the X newspaper reporter could write more vividly, erotically, and sensually.</p>
<p>What about the foreign devils? At that time, they wouldn't be as [rampant] as they are now. These Yi and Di countries would definitely be shocked by the [Han Kingdom's prosperity], and would come to pay tribute every year to restore the past glory. Thinking of them crawling on their knees from the Meridian Gate all the way to the Golden Dragon Hall, prostrating and shouting "Long live!" without daring to look up, and even recalling their oppression of China now, their ugliness, it really makes me feel elated. Although I also worry that there will be another Jin Wuzhu or An Lushan at that time.</p>
<p>Judging from historical facts, reviving the past is ultimately good. China has [nothing else to say] besides reviving the past. However, when I think of the [golden marriage certificates] of the empresses of the past dynasties inevitably being bought by [Yi and Di], and even though it is specified to use brushes, it is still unavoidable to advocate using fountain pens to [write English], to the extent that although the [holy temple] has received money, it has not yet been built, and the [ancient corpse turns to ashes as soon as it sees the wind], I can't help but [change color] a little. Alas!崇崇 the present is certainly not possible, and reviving the past is also somewhat vague. After writing the [Records of Ancient Matters], I can only put myself on the [shaking] shelf, [pursue] what?</p>
<h3>Roar, China!</h3>
<p>— Dong Meikan</p>
<p>The black curtain of night covers the earth, only a few stars twinkle in the darkness, holding lanterns and emitting the light of excitement, I walk in the light of the lanterns, it's hard to say it's early autumn, but the night is quite cold, wearing thin clothes, I feel a slight chill, I walk silently with a belly full of enthusiasm, walking towards the theater, on the streets where the noisy city sounds have not yet tired.</p>
<p>Walking all the way, everything on the street slipped past me unintentionally. Suddenly, I remembered the scene of [Roar, China] in Tokyo four years ago on a certain night.</p>
<p>I remember it was an early winter evening, the air in Tokyo was already very cold. I was invited by two friends to run to the new Tsukiji Theater in the middle of the night to watch the preview of [Roar, China].</p>
<p>When the time came, the workers were working with enthusiasm and courage; the audience were also excitedly staring and watching attentively. The atmosphere in the theater gradually became tense, and sympathetic anger filled everyone's hearts - the actors' hearts, the audience's hearts, roaring, the people in the theater, suddenly the entire theater was filled with roars, almost breaking the four walls of the theater.</p>
<p>We watched for half the night, until the next morning, and walked out of the theater extremely excitedly, returning to our own residence, the rose-colored sun had already climbed onto the eastern horizon. I really wanted to see their public performance again, but the evening was my return date, there was no way, so I left Tokyo at night.</p>
<p>Thinking, thinking, the theater arrived, I entered with a ticket, the huge venue was already full of people watching the play, I looked around, and found that almost every row of seats had friends sitting there, even those who were not my friends seemed quite familiar.</p>
<p>The curtain opened, a group of people in the colony - China struggling in suffering, being scolded and beaten by the so-called white foreign merchants, the incident gradually unfolded, these coolies had contact with the compliant people of a certain empire, because the coolies of the colony China had beaten to death foreign merchants who had white skin like them, so on the stage there burned the flames of repayment, producing various postures such as abuse, oppression, strangulation, and struggle. Now what we are seeing are these, these sufferings often suffered by colonial countries, what is planted in our hearts are the seeds of repayment, resistance, and struggle. Similarly, the comrades of the drama troupe are working tensely on the stage, the audience are watching enthusiastically and attentively, the atmosphere of the drama is getting thicker, the hearts of the audience are becoming tense, and finally, similarly, there appeared the roaring sounds of repayment. We, the people in the entire theater, as long as we were people, all roared, and immediately, the roar filled the entire theater, and the four walls almost burst.</p>
<p>At this time, the people in the Golden Grand Theater were roaring, and perhaps all parts of China were roaring like this. The imperialists are only invading day by day, and the people of the semi-colonial countries have long been involved in the anti-imperialist wave and are only shouting, Roar! China! Roar! Yes, China will eventually roar.</p>
<p>Brilliant and passionate light shone on the stage, and the tragic play ended here. The order of the audience became chaotic, and they swarmed out towards the entrance, Repayment, resistance, struggle, filling everyone's enthusiastic hearts - your heart, my heart, his heart, the hearts of all colonial slaves!</p>
<p>I walked to my residence very excitedly, the hot blood in my heart was boiling, the roars of the crowd had not yet disappeared from my ears, I thought... China is destined to roar, roar, China! Roar, China!</p>

<p>— Written by Henri de Regnier, Translated by Li Wanju</p>
<p>Below is what the voice said:</p>
<p>[Ah! Those poor worms, they don't even know what they're doing. Among this group of people, not one of them considers the fate of the motherland! They sacrifice everything for their current, insignificant benefits. Don't they even know that the future will use that merciless scale to weigh their actions! Is there not one among them who is willing to denounce their actions to themselves and make them consider their decency? Ah! If I were there, I would point out to them the abyss of shame they are rushing towards, and they would adopt my words, because everyone used to listen to me. But, now, it's over. I strangled myself with my own hands. The door to my life is closed forever. And now, who will still think of me, think of Lanweier, think of Maurice Lanweier! Ah! How miserable! How miserable! ......]</p>
<p>A rough punch, hitting a piece of furniture, which immediately crashed down, and at the same time I heard a woman's sobbing, choked with sobs.</p>
<p>Maurice Lanweier! Suddenly, I understood. Maurice Lanweier! This scandal twenty years apart floated into my mind again. I remembered the name I heard people talking about when I was a child, related to a famous scandal. Lanweier, this was the politician whose brilliant future suddenly sank into an irreparable failure. Lanweier, he was an eloquent and authoritative speaker, he was the leader of an important faction in the parliament, he had his glorious era, that fleeting glorious era. And I also remembered the seriousness of the situation at that time, the fierce threats from foreigners, the chaos in the country, and the enthusiastic words of Lanweier that inspired a brilliant patriotic movement, re-debating a memorable meeting of the congress. Later, on the day after the victory, when everyone's hopes were pinned on the one who seemed to be regarded as [the master of the era], Lanweier suddenly disappeared. I remembered his strange disappearance, his secret escape. Lanweier abandoned everything... family, responsibility, motherland... and eloped with a young woman he loved but could not marry. For her, he sacrificed his reputation and glory with love.</p>
<p>What I heard behind the door was Maurice Lanweier, who had changed his name to Mr. Duerlan Zhi, reminiscing about his past life, his authority as a speaker, and regretting the meaningless sacrifice he made in a moment of passion in the past. So I couldn't help but sadly think about the woman who was now silent in two layers of silence, the sobbing choke she just made. How much pain and what kind of guilt did she pay to exchange for that momentary intoxication of being loved? Ah! Poor people, when they conceal that famous love affair under a pseudonym, living such a wandering and exiled life, what has their love left them? What a fate, when the daily newspapers are delivered, sitting around a tea table in an ordinary hotel, in this remote place in the countryside, they formed a pair of [thought-provoking couples], and people who passed by here left with their sad image.</p>
<p>If the two Englishmen in the large living room hadn't woken me up when they went back to their rooms, it was already time for me to go back to sleep, I would have been meditating in front of their closed door for a long time. Because I have to leave early in the morning the next day, I should go to bed early. (The End)</p>

<h3>Vacuum Tube Usage Guide</h3>
<p>— Ming Xiang</p>
<p>Vacuum tubes, known as the soul of wireless radios, occupy the most important position in all wireless radios and are also of high value, so extreme caution must be taken when using them. If they are not used properly, it will lightly shorten their lifespan and affect the efficiency of the entire machine, and seriously destroy them in an instant. Here are a few notes on usage as a motto for wireless radio enthusiasts.</p>
<p>1.  The copper pins of the vacuum tube must be kept very clean, and so must the spring pieces of the lamp holder. The contact point between the copper pin and the lamp holder must be tightly sealed, otherwise, it is very easy to cause problems. 2. The filament voltage must not exceed the specified value. If it does not have much impact on the radio reception effect, it is best to use only three-quarters of the specified value. This point can extend the lifespan of the vacuum tube.</p>
<p>2.  The voltage of the C battery that supplies the grid negative potential (in AC machines, the voltage drop on the resistor is often used) must be accurate, otherwise, it is very easy to cause distortion.</p>
<p>3.  The plate voltage should not be too low, otherwise, it will reduce the volume. If the power source is obtained from the voltage divider of the rectifier section, it must be measured with a voltmeter with extremely high resistance, approximately 1000 ohms per volt, to be accurate.</p>
<p>4.  The work that the vacuum tube undertakes in the wireless radio must also be in accordance with what the manufacturer has stipulated. Inappropriate work is difficult to handle.</p>
<p>5.  Vacuum tubes with extremely high amplification factor (HiginMu) cannot be used in transformer-coupled amplification circuits, as this combination will inevitably distort the sound quality.</p>
<p>6.  For dry battery vacuum tubes (commonly known as power-saving light bulbs, such as 199, 109, 074, etc.), the filament voltage must absolutely not exceed the specified value, as their filaments are most easily burned out. 8. For AC vacuum tubes, the plate grid circuit is best connected to the center tap of the secondary coil of the power transformer that supplies the filament voltage, or a center-divided resistor can also be used. This connection can reduce the interference of AC noise.</p>
<p>7.  Vacuum tubes cannot be subjected to severe vibrations. They must be stable when the filament is heated and used, so lamp holders with meticulous designs often have springs installed to avoid damage to the filament of the vacuum tube due to vibration.</p>
<p>8.  A small number of thorium-coated filament vacuum tubes, such as 201A199222, etc., may occasionally fail to emit electrons after being used improperly or for too long (commonly known as silent light bulbs). They can still be revived with appropriate methods. The revival method will be described in another article.</p>
<h3>The Natural Wavelength of a Single-Wire Antenna</h3>
<p>— Yi Zhi</p>
<p>It is often heard that my antenna is 75 feet long, and it receives the sound from Station A very well, but if I change it to 100 feet, the sound from Station B is louder than that from Station A. What is the reason for this? It turns out that the antenna itself, like a choke coil, has inductance, capacitance, and resistance, so it has its own natural wavelength. If the wavelength of the station you are receiving matches the wavelength of your antenna, then the resonance is the most sensitive, and the induced power is the strongest. The input signal voltage of your radio receiver is large, and the volume will naturally be louder.</p>
<p>The inductance, capacitance, and resistance of the antenna can be represented by the diagram: A is the antenna, C is the ground wire, L shows its inductance, R shows its resistance, and C shows its capacitance.</p>
<p>The formula for the inductance of a single-wire horizontal antenna is:</p>
<p>L=2L（23logto2h1+14）X10-3·····（mh）</p>
<p>The formula for the capacitance of a single-wire horizontal antenna is:</p>
<p>C=L-46log102hrx1-9·····（mmf）</p>
<p>L is the inductance, the unit is megahenry (uh). C is the capacitance, the unit is microfarad (uuf). Ｉ is the length of the antenna, r is the radius of the wire, and h is the distance between the wire and the ground.</p>
<p>From the above two formulas, it can be seen that the natural wavelength of the antenna is absolutely related to the length, height, and wire diameter of the antenna. If the antenna is lengthened, the inductance, capacitance, and resistance will all increase. If the antenna is raised, it will only increase its inductance and decrease its capacitance, while the resistance will remain unchanged. If the length of the antenna is shortened or its height is lowered, the opposite is true. A sensitive antenna must have a large inductance and a small capacitance and resistance, so the higher the antenna is, the better.</p>
<p>Calculating the natural wavelength of a single-wire antenna is a bit troublesome, so I will omit it here. Now I will introduce a wavelength table that has already been calculated, and excerpt it below for reference:</p>
<p>Antenna Natural Wavelength Table</p>
<p>100 143 151 162 185</p>
<p>75 113 121 128 157</p>
<p>60 95 104 113 136</p>
<p>30 59 69 80 102</p>
<p>Horizontal Length (feet) Natural Wavelength (meters) Height (feet) 20 30 40 60</p>
<h3>Ground Wire Testing Method</h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Many people who install radios think that as long as the antenna is installed meticulously, they can get excellent results. Therefore, they think that the ground wire is unimportant. In fact, the mission of the ground wire in the radio is no less important than the antenna.</p>
<p>A bad ground wire will not only have a significant impact on the radio reception results, but also easily cause various noises - especially in AC machines, it is more likely to increase AC hum or generate many strange noises.</p>
<p>Whether the ground wire is good or not depends on the amount of its own resistance. There are of course many ways to test the ground wire resistance, but if there is no sophisticated instrument, it is impossible to start for a while.</p>
<p>Ordinary external power lines (electric light lines or power lines, etc.) probably have one wire connected to the ground wire. (See the left side of the attached diagram) If you use this point to install, you can solve the above difficulties.</p>
<p>First measure the external voltage with a voltmeter as usual (see the dotted line in the figure). If the measured value is Ei, then change one end of the voltmeter to receive the radio ground wire, and the other end is still connected to the power line A (it is impossible to know which of the AB lines is the ground wire, so you can switch them). At this time, the value (E2) shown by the voltmeter pointer, if...</p>
<p>(1) Drops to zero, it proves that the ground wire is broken.</p>
<p>(2) Trembles incessantly, it proves that the ground wire contact point is bad, or it is about to break.</p>
<p>(3) Differs greatly from E1, it proves that the ground wire itself has a large resistance.</p>
<p>(4) Is slightly smaller than E1, it proves that the ground wire itself has a slight resistance.</p>
<p>(5) Is close to or equal to E1, it proves that the ground wire itself has extremely low resistance.</p>
<h3>Commemorating Edison</h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>Tomorrow, October 8th, is the second anniversary of Edison's death. This day is one that everyone should remember. Edison's life deeds and his personality are so worthy of respect and emulation by our young people. It is not known how many things he invented. He once tried [space telegraph] to create the term [etheric power]. He also discovered that electrons are emitted from the hot filament when experimenting with electric lights, which is the so-called [Edison effect]. This was very helpful for the later invention of vacuum tubes.</p>
<p>Before the age of fifty-five, Edison averaged nineteen and a half hours of work per day. When inventing the phonograph, he even worked for five days and nights at a time. In his youth, he liked to try all the experiments in books one by one. He did not pay attention to clothes and decorations, but he was not stingy at all when it came to buying books, instruments, and medicines.</p>
<p>Because of commemorating Edison, we feel how much our country needs inventors. Our country is already in a serious situation of internal and external troubles, so we hope that there can also be an Edison born in China to save the people from suffering with great inventions and place the country in a state of stability.</p>
<p>Finally, we quote one of Edison's famous sayings: [Genius is one percent inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.]</p>
<h3>Repairing and Reconstructing Electrical Capacitors</h3>
<p>— ]Zhibing</p>
<p>In all radio AC generators, within their power supply circuits, there exists something called a filter. Its composition is a combination of a choke coil and a fixed capacitor. These capacitors have a large capacity and must be capable of handling high voltage loads. Therefore, their construction is difficult and their value is high. Because they are located in high-voltage circuits, they are very prone to damage. Therefore, people who study radio often discard them because they are difficult to repair, which is a pity and a helpless situation.</p>
<p>Now, there is a method for repairing and reconstructing them, written below. Fellow radio enthusiasts, please follow this method and try it out, and you may be able to recover a small portion of your lost money.</p>
<p>To know how to repair them, you must first understand their construction. The construction of these capacitors is very simple: two long strips of tin foil are rolled up with three long strips of waxed paper in between (some are parallel combinations of two, three, or four sets of rolled-up capacitors). The purpose of the three strips of waxed paper is to insulate the two strips of tin foil. The cause of their damage is that a small portion of the insulation is poor or broken, causing the two tin foils to short-circuit, thus losing their capacitance function.</p>
<p>To repair them, carefully disassemble the outer metal or cardboard casing, and carefully scrape off any wax or sealing wax adhering to its surroundings. Then, unfold the capacitor, which consists of three layers of waxed paper and two layers of tin foil rolled up. Cut off a square from the remaining part of the tin foil extending from the outer end of the waxed paper. Patch the damaged area of the waxed paper layer by layer, roll it up again as before, and reinstall it in its original place and try it. The function should remain unchanged. The following are some points to note when unfolding for repair and re-rolling:</p>
<p>(1) Points to note when unfolding:</p>
<p>1. After the outer casing is disassembled, the wax adhering to the capacitor must be carefully scraped off without damaging the waxed paper and tin foil of the capacitor.</p>
<p>2. Do not use fire to melt the wax, as this may burn the waxed paper and melt the tin foil.</p>
<p>3. When unfolding the capacitor, be careful not to tear the waxed paper or pull and break the edges, as it will be difficult to roll it back to its original shape.</p>
<p>4. When unfolding to the burnt area of the capacitor, check how many layers are burnt and remove all the burnt layers. However, do not unfold all the way, only to the last layer. (To be continued)</p>
