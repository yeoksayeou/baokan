<p>命該車夫折往引翔港軍工路、司機吳春山、當即依言轉向軍工路而去、詎車將駛至軍工路春江路口時、後面四人中、突有一人用蔴繩套在吳之喉間、用力猛勒、同時由穿西装者袖出手槍、向吳威嚇、禁止聲張、斯時吳春山心知不妙、乃急將車煞住、但身旁又有一人用毛巾一方、塞入車夫口内、並將其由車曳下、用繩將其手足綑縛、推在路旁後、重復登車、自行駕車、向租界方面而去、吳春山目見車已去遼、乃極力掙扎、良久始得脫縛、並取出口内毛巾、即拔步飛奔、至附近五區四分所報告、</p>

<p>該所得報、立即撥派大批長警、四出追緝、惟以時間過遲、竟無所獲、當即回所報告、同時車夫吳春山亦電話至該行報告經過、因此當時該行即投報匯山等各捕房、請求偵緝、五區四分所亦急分電總局及各區所法租界等請予協助追查、一時偵騎四佈、形勢嚴重、直至正午十二時、尙無線索、詎至下午四時左右、該車突在四馬路外灘附近發現、由崗捕瞥見後、亟返中央捕房報告、當由捕房撥派中西探員前往查看、則僅一空車停留、再檢察車中足跡及手印等、亦無慌忙雜亂狀態、乃設法將車中所留指足印等印下、携歸捕房存案、以便追查、更通知遠東汽車公司於五時許、派車夫將該車開回、惟該四人旣行刦車、勢必有所企圖、乃今一無下文、殊屬不解、實業部進行合併</p>

<p>假使具有［圓顱方趾］的，一律是做[無條件的人］那全世界都能［和氣霝霝］的了，但是［人］還有種族的差别。</p>
<p>例如同樣是高鼻，碧眼，黃頭髮的，硬分出［大英人］與［花旗人］來。同是在歐洲大陸上的［人］又分出［求門人］，［佛來西人］，［西洋人］，［羅宋人］，而且同是［求門人］，還有一老牌求門人］與［猶太人］的分别，眞好要子。</p>
<p>再說我們亞細亞洲上的［人］，果然也都是［圓顱方趾］的，但是皮膚墨黑，鬍子光光的，呌做［小呂宋人］，皮膚墨黑，于思于思的，呌做［印度人］，短小精悍的，呌做［東洋人］，大而無當的，呌做［友那人］。</p>
<p>現在就吸說［支那人］，也就［五花八門］，弄不大淸楚。通常所接觸的，有［廣東人］，［寗波人］，［江北人］，［山東人］，［浦東人］，九一八後，又見到了許多進關來的［滿洲人］，打着幾句膽舌頭的，自命爲［北京人］，但是說話儘說得［上海人］都聽不懂的，也要硬做［上海人］。　　在横的方面是如此，在蹤的方面，也［洋洋乎大觀］。</p>
<p>同是［上海人］，還有［上等人］與［下等人］之别，在［上等人］之上，更有［大偉人］，在［下等人］之下，更有［起碼人］。在［上等人］與［下等人］之間，還有不上不下的［中等人］。在上中下三等之外，無法歸類的，還有一種［白相人］。</p>
<p>［人］除了上中下三大等級之外，條分縷析的更分爲［福氣人］，［享福人］，［讀書人］，［聞人］，［要人］，［窮人］，［苦人］，［亂人］，［尴尬人］，［能幹人］，［無用頭人］，［時髦人］，［晦氣人］等等數不淸，說不盡的［人］。而更其新奇的，一塊土上生長的，還有［城裏人］與［鄉下人］之别。</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>［二房東］，在上海，眞是不可一世，三房客，果然畏之如虎，大房東，也不免見了要對之汗毛站班。</p>
<p>二房東對於大房東，常年拖欠房租二三個月，是客氣不過的了，但是三房客要拖欠二房東十天半個月，對不住，［白眼相向］還嫌不夠，通常是［勒令遷移］。</p>
<p>華界發生了戰事，租界上也减租三月。大房東唖子吃黃連，二房東合不攏嘴的哈哈笑，因爲亭子樓二十元三層擱十八元，召租上漿糊没乾，空房子已給逃難人租掉了。若是三房客也妄想要减租，二房東準會鼻子裏哼一聲［不加租，已很客氣了］。</p>
<p>自來水費是大房東包付的·所以二房東每天洗地板之外，每夜還得旋開了自來水龍頭，放到天亮，不浪費，白便宜了大房東。但是三房客的電燈，海關上大鐘，只敲了十二點鐘的第一響·二房東實行［防空演習］，已反［總門］關妥了。若是三房客把二十五支燭光的燈泡換了三十二支光的，一經二房東覺察，便會立刻駡上門。</p>
<p>公共的弄堂·二房東因灶間出租了，就佔着燒飯洗衣服，據說，這是佔大房東的便宜，不干人家事的三房客若到客堂裏放了一隻擱脚凳·二房東便會把凳接着鷄驚爭食似的簇擁上一羣蓋布短褂的補缺者；二等電車的廂位本不算小，但因便宜了三個銅子的關係，便擁得水洩不通，賣票先生須得獻出趙子龍長坂坡前救阿斗的武藝，繼可殺出一條血路賣幾張票子；一位身穿杭紡的長衫，頭戴哥侖比亞帽的朋友，也擠在汗臭薰蒸的人叢裏·就表面看去·無疑的·他是鷄羣中的獨鶴·</p>
<p>頭等電車裏呢？坐着兩個蓬髮，裸腿的摩登密斯，一個百站七十磅的中年婦人，和五六個面容煥發，神氣活現的中等華人（注···高等華人坐汽車），空得懶坯們可以伸長腿兒擱在坐凳上打瞌睡；電車中間的一扇門，不啻一道鴻溝，很明顯地分出貧與富的兩個階級，不，無產與中產的攸分·這是何等的不平啊　　然而頭等火車，輪船官艙，常常覺得冷靜的可怕，同時，四等火車，跑進四五統艙，則每苦無挿足的所在‘跑進四五層的洋房，有時·兜上一個大圈子找不着半個人影兒，而一幢鴿籠式的舊房子，却要安排五六個住户；『朱門酒肉臭，途有凍死骨』，人類不平等的事實，幾於觸目皆是·豈獨電車爲然？</p>
<p>從前美利堅由華盛頓市經過曼温特發隆村，到逹波逹麥河左岸９喬治華盛頓的故里）的電車，分出白種人和黑種人的座位，界限極嚴，不可逾越，不幸的黑種人，竟做了民族不平等社會下的被侮辱者；我們頭等二等的電車座位，有錢便可以自由乘坐，不受任何約束，一脚踢到大門外。</p>
<p>大房東的立塲，便好似大太太身份。二房東，便是潑辣兇悍的姨太太身份。年頭兒，自然是姨太太得勢。至於三房客，說也可憐，竟是處於姨太太淫威之下的老爺，要長便長，要短便短。有時姨太太給大太太訓斥了一頓，那自然又是老爺晦氣。</p>
<p>在上海做三房客的，總末有見了二房東不吐舌頭的，更其是新從三房東，升起來的二房東，猶如淌白一躍而爲姨太太，甚麽都幹得出來。</p>
<p>一日不打倒二房東三房客一日不能安枕。</p>

<p>關耀武嘴裏正啣着一枝烟捲靜靜的向下聽，聽到了這裏，再也忍耐不住了。於是手按了桌子角，身子一挺，大有要站起來說話的意思。江氏這就搖搖手道：不用說，你的意思，我完全明白了。我對你實說，昨天晚上，我就得了消息，知道趙連長爲了這頭親事，情願把連長辭掉來。我們那丫頭，你别瞧他那僇孩子，倒是有心眼的。服說，這可使不得，什麽人也不應該爲了親事，把前程丢了，做女孩子的誰也不肯擔這個罪名。只憑趙連長這一句話，也就讓人家聽了很樂意。再說，我們去年不得過年，身上扖下棉襖來當，多虧人家帮了忙，算是在當舖櫃台、上把棉襖拿了回來。現在明白了，人家也是當皮袍子來的錢呢。關耀武道：怪呀！這些事你怎麽全知道呢？江氏聽說，微笑了一笑道：你别問我是怎知道的？我說的這些話，究竟是對與不對呢？關耀武道：一點不錯，你是怎麽樣子，會摸得這樣的淸楚？江氏微笑道：這條路子，我不能告訴你，告訴了你，以後就會得不着消息啦。關耀武笑道：你倒打算以後還行着消息，這樣子你對於這頭親事是願意啦。江氏道：照說呢，像趙連長這種人，我可没有什麽話說的了。我也就是想着當軍人的只有公事，没有私事，我這孩子出了門子，還是當姑娘一樣，一個人過日了，我又何必要他出門子呢？因爲這樣，所以這一程子，我心裏老是不能决定。現在我聽到說，他也覺得我們這一層顧慮是對的，願意丢了連長不幹。這不但我們姑娘，覺得恩情太厚了。就是我想着，那也不敢當（一五八）</p>

<p>— 冰玉</p>
<p>因爲唇的形狀，厚有薄，口的構造，有大有小，例如喇叺口，鯉魚口，大小闊狹，千差萬别，而且唇與口。很有密切的關係，而唇的色澤，也有種種，若是不用人工來補救他，就要牽動眉目鼻各部分的美。現在我把搽唇的方法來說一下：大凡唇的色澤，各人是不同的，有黝黑色，蒼白色，灰紅色，這種唇色，外觀非常難看，當然不能吸引對方的熱情，所以不得不把唇的顔色改造。改造的手術，先看口的大小，唇的厚薄，若是厚唇口大的人，可在唇的外側，用極淡的紅色搽上一半，口唇的内側，要用深紅色塗抹，那末；口大的人，看起來好像口小了。若是口小唇薄的人，那不論唇的内外兩側，都要用濃淡平均的鮮紅色塗遍，自然可以變成厚而大了。但是不可塗得太闊，應當斟酌連宜，倘若是一張喇叺口，那上唇的上半與下唇的下半，可以不塗，惟在上唇的下半，與下唇的上半，用深紅色搽上，就可以補正口的缺點。所以化妝的時候，切不可忘記唇的個性。說到搽唇的臙脂，有不會褪色的紅薔薇色臙脂，這種臙脂，本來爲美國楊葛博士當外科手術時消毒用所製造，名爲Ｍｅｒｃｕｒｙ·Ｃｈｒｏｍｉｕｍ，當時不過爲代用沃度丁幾的東西，後來經過幾回試用，雖然着水，也可以經過三四日，不會褪色。到了現在，愈加進步，不但顔色美艶，而且有消毒防腐的功效，所以與愛人接吻時，更能發揮他的吸引力。以上所述搽唇的要訣，請有閑夫人摩登小姐們，特别注意。</p>
<p>染指甲的要訣</p>
<p>染指甲的方法，非常簡單，但是有許多要點，不可不注意的，現在所流行的指甲式樣，大槪爲鋤形Ｓｈａｄｅ與鐵石形Ｄｉａｍｏｕｄ兩種銳角形，用桃紅色的琺瑯質Ｅｎａｍｅｌ美爪藥塗上後，就會發生美艶的光澤，可是妝飾指甲，應當先把自己手，忖度一下，是否於妝飾的？換句話說，就是看自己的指形，是否有装飾的資格？爲什麽呢？因爲許多人的手，皮膚粗黑，指形闊扁，指頭粗短，這種手，無論怎樣妝飾起來，總不能使人引起美感的，應當具備［玉指纖纖］［嫩如春筍］的要件，方値得妝飾。我常常看見婦女們的手，指甲内積滿垢污，指頭上爲烟氣薰得黃黑，而在指甲上，染了桃紅色，這眞是矛盾極了。所以請婦女們，先從根本上解决淸潔後，才談得到妝飾呢。至於染色時，有一點我們應當特别注意，因爲有許多病毒，往往從修指甲而起的，就是醫學上所謂一種瘭疽蟲，竟有把手指的關節，成爲瘭瘋麻木的，又因黴菌從指甲内侵入，發生化膿痰症的，所以修剪指甲的時候，應當消毒，現在普通的消毒法，先用微温的肥皂水洗凈垢污，再用千倍的昇乘水浸五分鐘，把指頭揩乾，再浸在百分之七○酒精溶化液中，使指甲上的表皮，漸漸剥脫，最後塗上桃紅色的琺瑯質美爪藥，那末不會發生危險性的病毒了。</p>

<p>大土地之中國、縱失邊省、縱失大都會、固不能制其死命、固不能杜其再戰、敵人因不能不虞一旦中國全體國民共起以圖反攻、以轉敗而爲勝、靑年的軍事訓練、誰負其責、這當然是中央軍官的責任、中央軍官指終身服務的專門的職業的軍官、有特設的中央軍官學校、茲可不提、國民的最高統帥權、依國民政府組織法之規定、完全屬於國民政府、所有全國陸海空軍之建設保持運用、及關於一切軍政軍令之權、皆完全屬於中央最高軍事機關掌握、務期軍事絕對統一、國家不蹈從前軍權旁落割據相循之覆轍、而立國權鞏固國防充實之基礎、故民間軍官上則受中央軍官之教育與指揮、下則教育民衆與指揮民衆、民間軍官兼有教育與指揮兩種責任、蓋能教育而不能指揮、則原則與應用勢難連續、學校與部隊截爲兩途、能指揮而不能教育、亦難以完善其指揮、蔣百里先生說道、一稱譽人而曰文武全才、祇有中國人如此說法、歐西人從無此語、鄙人細味此語、似有病徵、中國之不振、根本原因、或由於此、蓋文所以代表智識、武所以代表力量、稱譽人而曰文武全才、無異謂普通人士、文不能武、武不能文、明言之、卽有智識者必無力量、有力量者必無智識、苟兼而有之、則眞難能可貴、試思有智識而無力量、將何以實施、智識何用、有力量而無智識、將何以辨别、力量何貴、人必須智識力量二者兼具、固是全才、然此分内之事、又何譽之有、］</p>
<p>學生之軍事訓練、在平日爲功課所限、尙嫌其不足、故宜利用假期、就會操地點、設立軍事研究班、研究必要的軍事學術、且不僅以地上爲止、又當兼行空中及海上軍事訓練、利用假期、養成學生飛行及學生航海、其演習之時、宜假定其國境地帶爲敵國侵入、而研究因應之方法、如動員之迅速、動作之活潑、皆可就地演習、猶懼民間軍官教育之未足也、可再組織在鄉軍人會、以爲討論軍事問題之中心機關、國民防禦之誠積於中、則發揚蹈厲之槪顯於外、在鄉軍人會之組織、無不公開無不自由、每値政府將立軍事法律、將行一軍事行政、民間軍民不妨自行集會以討論之、而陳述其意見於當局、卽政府已立一法、已行一政、亦莫不從事討論之、是是非非、質續、則於報端登廣告、其集合地點卽在學校、其討論軍事學術、有如討論哲學、歷史、法律、政治等、思想活潑、意志自由、並刋行軍事雜志、以發表學術上之進步、風氣一開、自能爲中國軍事一新其面目與精神、蓋軍事學者、不過人生學識之一部、此、部與他部之連絡、不可不知也、此一部之分析與全體之綜合、不可不知也、往古來今、軍官之能成各將者、無不富於普通學識、能代表時代之思潮、而示人生之正鵠、彼不學無術之徒斷不能成爲名將、</p>
<p>前美國大總統羅斯福在舊金山演說、鼓吹軍國民主義、說不願意美國成中國化（Ｃｈｉｎａｆｉｅｄ）、中國文化是不能永久適存於世界的嘕？這是令人聽了非常傷心的事、但我們現在只能借日本的旣成事實、來辯白羅斯福氏的謬論、那更其是令人傷心的事、中國文化由孔子而興、嗣後二千四百年間、爲東亞諸邦所依據、以其形式言之、則稍似宗教、（日人稱孔學爲儒教）惟孔學多說現世的道德、不似宗教注重於超世的觀念、孔學與科學並行、毫不相背、其器度較宗教爲尤大、據目人井上哲次郎說、孔學爲明治教育之一大要素、忠孝仁義之德義的懇化、從精神上鎔鑄陶冶日本民族之性格者、以孔學之勢力爲最大、孔學之目的在涵養德性、利用其個人之偉大精神、以鼓勵民衆之意志、由今日言之、卽以人格修養爲其要旨、在明治維新之際、處十活動、致力於新文明之開拓者、以孔學之徒爲多、此等志士、非屬於朱子學派、卽屬於陽明學派、陽明學派爲數較少而所出豪傑較多、實爲明治維新之原動力云、陽明學派以良知爲依據、良知所視、苟爲善爲正、則斷斷乎實行之、多偏於主觀的判斷、不顧其所處之境遇、雖非無弊、而富於實行之精神、眞爲痛快矣、杜錫珪氏赴日本考察海軍、嘗訪問海軍次官山梨氏、山梨謂中國古藉中如孫武兵書關於戰略之學、高深精妙、有非德國近代戰略諸書所能望其項背者、現在吾國（指日本）海陸軍學生、研究中國兵書者甚多、東鄉元帥卽爲崇拜王陽明先生者、陽明學說爲日本士大人夫所景仰、杜氏云、聞此語、不覺汗流浹背也、</p>
<p>方今中國民氣頽表、聞魂消滅、非發揚孔學、不能閘宏軍隊的元氣、振作軍隊的精神、孔學爲中國之國魂、亦爲一切改革之原動力、哀莫大於心死、中國國心、已瀕死境、新孔學實爲使此將死之國魂復活之惟一良方、二千餘年來、如王陽明者尙大有人在、歷史上之教訓何限、孔學之在中國、不僅一光榮的遺產、乃一實力的遺產、元氣恢復之方、鼓勇制勝之道、端在於是、國人但知日本佔領我領土、而不知日軍佔領我領土之先、固先佔領我王陽明先生等之戰略戰術、近數十年來、日本學王陽明、而我乃學日本、識爲一大怪事、夫間接學王陽學、何如直接學固有之王陽明、孔子之遺產、自己不知承受、致落他人手、他人反利用之以攻我敗我、棄固有之國寳、拾他人之殘骸、天下可痛之事、寗有過此、軍事教育、日人行之、一舉而戰勝我國、再舉而戰勝强俄、稱雄東亞、我國行之、則徒以造成擾亂顚危之局者、蓋一以爲國、一以爲私、一以統一、一以分散、問其所以然的緣故、不能不太息痛恨於中國一般國民、敝屣舊學、成爲通病、蓋日本民族、雖受西方文化、領會西邦學術、而不可無其素養、這素養是從孔學而來、孔子曰［不憤不啟、不悱不發、］現在大家正在熱心提倡靑年之軍事訓練的時候、我們却不能不大聲疾呼以喚起我垂死的國魂、（完）</p>

<p>第一戰香港八比六勝</p>
<p>第二戰發生毆打風潮</p>
<p>（香港通信）五日下午四時、有一場特别壘球賽舉行於加露連山南華球塲、對壘者爲檀香山歸國華僑隊與本港南華冠軍隊、雙方實力相時、藎檀島隊中有曾爲我國運東代表、如鄭發余伯惠輩、其技術早已深印吾人腦海中矣、至於其他各員、亦屬新自檀埠歸來者、至於兩華隊、除鄭氏兄弟効力檀除外、亦多自外國歸來者、周龍驂、方碩桐、方碩培、陳倫英等回自美國加里福尼亞省、而鮑健宏、鄭慶揚、鄭彪等則歸自日本、觀以上形勢、謂爲勢均力敵、誰曰不然、</p>
<p>六日之戰、南華於九局中卒以八比六勝、是非檀島隊之技術遜於南華、實緣檀島隊瞬息集合、未及南華聯絡之精耳、是次特别比賽、取三塲二勝制、檀隊反攻正大有機會、南華雖勝、亦未可安枕也、七日下午四時、兩隊又相見於南華場矣、以爲兩隊必有更緊張之比賽、不幸竟於中途發生毆打風潮、球賽不歡而散、誠膠遺憾、茲將詳情分誌如下、</p>
<p>第一戰全塲戰情、實無時不在風聲鶴唳中、南華行自日本歸來之鄭慶揚任投手、頗見勝任愉快、周龍驂之技想閱者早已瞭然、鄭彪陳倫英及方氏兄弟善擊善守、不與檀島隊半點機會、吳鎭邦鮑健宏亦見精彩、總之、南華隊實已表学其藝術於衆矣、檀隊因林金友不暇、以鄭發任投手、亦能無忝厥職、高漢恩、余伯惠、鄭瓊仁尤爲隊中之出色者、只任右翼之劉氏失守數次爲憾耳、</p>

<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>ＤｏｎＱｕｉｘｏｔｅ看游俠小說看瘋了，便自己夫做俠客·打不平。他的親人知道是書籍作的怪，就請了間壁的理髮匠來檢查；理髮匠選出幾部好的留下來，其餘的便都燒掉了。</p>
<p>Ｂ女士却因爲要移家，請了我去做［理髮匠］，反她父兄的遺書［檢查］一下，［選出幾部好的留下來］，其餘無用的，也預備［都燒掉］。</p>
<p>當我檢查的時候，檢出一本［高等小學論說文範卷四］，本當歸在［燒掉］之列的，但偶而一翻，看見其中的第二篇是［論東三省］·好奇地看完之後，却不禁［拍案呌絕］了。</p>
<p>全文如下：</p>
<p>［我國之有東三省，猶川之有防也。防潰，則水至，東三省去，則國亡。此無可諱者也。日人自呑滅朝鮮後，急急欲伸其手於東三省，其視之猶囊中物也。今則昌言於衆：或主兵力，或主商隊，必欲得之而後已。甚且野心勃勃，更欲侵及東蒙。嗚呼日人，何甘爲戎首，好自戕其同種也耶│夫世界有何公理？俾斯麥曰：黑鐵耳。赤血耳，吾亦曰：欲保東三省以保中國，舍鐵與血，斷斷無倖。新政府創造經營，於東三省之防務，無暇專顧，獨東三省人民，生於斯，長於斯，衣食於斯·豈忍恝然！是故存東三省者，東三省也。亡東三省者，亦東三省也。思之，思之，鄭重思之，有垂涎於吾者，以生命擲之，擲之而東三省或有幾也。不然，其防一撤，恐全國且隨之以俱盡也。然則，視此七尺軀，又何容顧恤爲耶！]</p>
<p>這本論說文範，是上海會文堂發行的，［中華民國三年七月訂正十六版］，初版發行，是在民國元年，著者是邵伯棠。但據［古越蔡誠䟦]，則邵棠逝世於[楚中倡義］時，不克［目睹共和］，故原著未符時事處·曾經蔡氏［勉易數篇。］這篇［論東三省］，提起［新政府，］則亦爲蔡作可知。</p>
<p>這文章的作成，離開現在已經二十二年了，距東三省淪亡，則恰好二十年。其中所說的［新政府］，還是袁世凱政府。然而。二十年後的政府，不也還是［東三省防務，無暇專顧]麼？二十年後的[世界]，不也還是沒有[公理]麼？至於說日本對滿蒙的野心，東三省與全國的關係，以及當以武力抵抗侵略諸點，無不正確。尤其是[亡東三省者，亦東三省也］一語，足令［生於斯，長於斯，衣食於斯］的張少帥俯首無辭，［豈忍恝然」，而孰知竟恝然了，尙何言哉！</p>
<p>自從九一八事件發生的兩年來，不知有多少鴻篇鉅製，見於書報，然而眞知灼見，要言不煩，孰能有及此二十年前之寥寥二百六十一字者乎？</p>
<p>這樣看來，中國並不缺乏有識之士。但有識之士只能做論說文，心有餘而力不足，國事却是别一種人在管的，所以二十年前眞知灼見了的危機，二十年後終於蹈入二十年後的局面，竟使二十年前的人有［不幸而吾言中］之痛。</p>
<p>但論說文能夠做到這樣，斯眞可以爲［範［矣。</p>
<h3 id="c222">談談中國的所謂［藝術運動］ <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 符一葉</p>
<p>在中國，藝術運動也和政治運動一樣的黑暗，藝術家（？）是不要羣衆的，他們只一意孤行，忙於個人的名利的建設：今天勾結幾位要人名流來當發起人，舉行個人的展覧會，明天再拉攏自己的同帮同行的朋友，辦雜誌，出畫集，自吹自捧，或互吹互捧：接着自己便是大師，畫宗了。所謂藝術運動的成績，僅以我們這些畫宗，大師畫展的門票和畫集的銷售數量的多寡爲標準。因此，今日中國藝術界的腐敗現象並不較政治舞台爲下。</p>
<p>然而眞正的［藝術運動］却因此受着大大的誤解了。社會上只曉得某人是藝術家，大師，畫宗。而這些畫宗，大師便和要人名流一樣的被列爲特殊階級，至於他們在藝術上的造詣如何，藝術給予社會一些什麽影響，我人對於藝術的要求與認識等等，根本可以不談，因爲大師畫宗所要求的是名利，而社會也只要認識某人爲大師，畫宗這就夠了。名利的追求和偶像的崇拜，佈成目前這種藝術運動的塲面。這種滑稽劇一年一年地演下去，除使少數騙子和流氓成名發財外，藝術是將始終與社會絕緣的。這祇看我們有了所謂藝術運動將近二十年，而美女月份牌還仍舊在那裏被人歡迎，從國外歸來的靑年藝術家，還得改業來替人家畫啤酒，香烟的廣告，便可知道。</p>
<h3 id="c223">老闆 <a href="#c223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— 蔡念蓀</p>
<p>半年來，老闆的臉益發陰沉得可怕了　。</p>
<p>以前，老闆雖有一副每一個老闆所有的神氣│威嚴，但那充滿了烟癮的灰白色的臉上，有時却掛上一絲笑容；說話也比較多，而且威嚴中帶着温和的口吻。譬如，去年老郁因爲母親病重，急忙趕回家去，没有通知老闆：回來，老闆祗說：［以後你要先對我說起一聲］。没有别的囉囌的話。</p>
<p>這半年，情形不同了。他的臉，那灰白的臉，全没有笑痕；整個面部都顯得陰沉。而且兩眼放射着憤懣與痛恨交織成的怒燄，望去像要吃人。話，很少，說來總是冷冷的，令人起嚴寒的感覺。　　每個店員，都在戰兢兢地過日子，望着老闆的影子，就害怕。</p>
<p>老闆呢，逢己也不明白爲何這樣陰沉，他只惱恨着，惱恨着布的没有銷路。家裏堆滿了自去年年底半年來陸續收下的布，他望見布就心痛；心痛得不願在家裏，但大半天的時光還是消磨在布莊上。</p>
<p>每天·他照例坐在門檻旁的藤椅上，托着水烟管嘘嘘的吹着。這時·店堂裏鴉雀無聲。櫃前，因半年不放紗，顯得很冷落。有時，難得有一兩個鄉下婦人，拿布上來，店員伸了個懶腰，稍稍打起精神，先量了長短，然後細細的看那布的粗細，在老闆眼光的對照中，還了價：［一吊二！］［一吊七吧！上月······］於是老闆在一旁冷冷地開口了：［尺二頭（莊·就是闊一尺二寸門面的土布）三給你帶了，你還嫌少！］鄉婦幾次呶呶爭辯，終於忍痛賣去了。</p>
<p>鄉婦走出店門，老闆便怏怏的埋怨：［現在的人，有什麽良心，尺二頭，那爿布莊要收？給他帶了，還要爭多嫌少！］</p>
<p>店員們也附和着，其實他們肚裏很明白，那是怎麽一回事。</p>
<p>布没有銷路，非但老闆焦急，他們也着實恐慌。自從東北掛上了太陽旗，銷路便銳滅了。跟着南洋華僑經濟的衰落，布又失去了市塲的一角。現在只有閩廣山東三省了·洋布又這樣便宜，誰高興買小粗劣的土布？這形勢，布業確難於撑持，不倒閉就要大批裁人。</p>
<p>向來會說話的秦和張，也漸漸變得沉默了：這麽一羣店員，祗是整天希望着，希望　老闆的臉上恢復笑容。</p>
<p>但老闆的臉却一天一天地來得陰沉可怕！</p>

<p>— 敷德</p>
<p>世間有些東西最忌平凡，如：詩，音樂，繪畫，演說等是。</p>
<p>英雄們的生活把歷史顯得熱閙，而歷史又把英雄們的行爲顯得漂亮；這樣看來，究竟是寫歷史的人應當感謝那提供他們以如許崇高的材料的英雄呢，還是這班豪傑之士應當感謝他們的歷史家？</p>
<p>一部分人的光榮與功績是在乎寫得好，而另一部分人却在一字不寫。</p>
<p>蠢人讀書，一無所得。凡人讀書，以爲盡解。賢人讀書，有時不能盡解，晦澀處還以晦澀，正如明白處還以明白。才人讀書則常以明白處爲晦澀，十分可解處，固爲不解。</p>
<p>一個優良的細心的作家常是覺得他花了許多時候才尋着的詞句，原是最質樸，最自然，起初便可毫不費力地想到的詞句。</p>

<p>［這樣我就眞對不起了！府上有甚麽事，像是老伯還没有曉得！］</p>
<p>［老兄說那一位？］</p>
<p>［令尊老伯。］</p>
<p>［家嚴？］</p>
<p>［是的，令尊老伯！］</p>
<p>［家嚴那裏會曉得！我整整裏有兩天没有看見他老人家！老兄今天可曾見過？］</p>
<p>［見過的，老伯現在還在舍下。］</p>
<p>［眞的嗎？］伯唐霍地一下立起來，［就是重慶路嗎？我正要找家嚴談幾名話。］</p>
<p>說完他就拉住了子春的袖子：</p>
<p>［我們就可以同走嗎？］</p>
<p>子春立起了，飯堂裏的人也都立起了，大家都像是受到一陣無形的推送力，不知不覺也一齊跟着他們兩個走出了飯堂。</p>
<p>伯唐在上車之後，又伸出頭來高聲說：</p>
<p>［現在還是請你替我管一下，之光；我見了爹老爺，立刻就有回音，佩萸，你先打個電話去罷······］</p>
<p>不到半點鐘，之光和佩萸已經接了伯唐的信，意思就是：</p>
<p>［我已與老人家會面，目下甚麽都已經根本平安，一切無須墨念。接濟的東西，趁早通知廠裏照議交割。兩俞的防線同時撤銷。馬文卿處並應派人通告。我少緩卽回，其餘均候面叙·····］</p>
<p>這座大樓裏裏外外的空氣，立刻復了常軌了；那封信裏的話，也一件由之光和佩萸分别執行。直到伯唐在傍晚回來的時候，大家才曉得雍孫幹的這件奇妙勾當的起原：後來伯唐又述起其中的經過情形：</p>
<p>［他們到今天已經第八天了。據說老五每天可以分到千多洋錢一天的頭錢，頑到前天早上，她已經得到一個很好看的數目。這當然全是爹老爺的面子。子春覺得這種交情│我不好意思說是恩惠│是應當特别報答的，所以前天，他們兩夫婦就决定趁着今天是他的三十三歲的生日，要在爺老爺名下拜做乾兒子，拜做六親公認冠冕堂皇的乾兒子。爺老爺當然無可無不可，所以就約好了日期：後來想到子春究竟比我大一兩歲，將來忽然稱我做我做兄弟，似乎來得不順口，所以又約我到塲，意思就是呌我承認。他們家裏已經擺好了香花蠟燭，預備到了八點鐘││戌時││正式磕頭，我們現在還得趕緊辦禮送過去·····哈哈，可不是滑稽！說到頑錢呢，他們本來預備再頑三四天，過了元宵就要收束，現在當然談不上了······哈哈·聽說大輸家是上海兩個著名的瘟生，一個姓周，一個姓程，他們每人都幹掉兩三萬！］　　伯唐眉飛色舞地說了這樣一大篇，又摳起了皮袍子來整理裏面的衣褲，弄了一會才繼續說道：</p>
<p>［可不是滑稽！在我，幸而運氣還好，只算將來對於馬文卿的謝禮，要着實多花幾個錢！······爺老爺的事總算了了：之光，我們接濟閘北的東西，有没有交割淸楚呢？］　　第二天早上，之光同着邱代表幾個人已走到伯唐家裏，從容拿出×××會的一張印收來。</p>

<h3 id="c245">廣告與現代商業及文化 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 文</p>
<p>坐在火灸的小室裏，胸口是怪煩膩的，腦子是怪混沌的，便漫然的與鄔君閒談一些與己身並無關係的事體，漸漸地談到了現代商業成功的要訣上。第一當然是要資要本雄厚，因爲現代的商業，已是絕對的[大蛙吃小蛙][貓兒捕老鼠]，資本不大，不能獨組[托拉司]，就必然的不但能沾利，壟斷，而且會蝕本坍台。第二就要靠廣告的閉眼瞎吹，炫亂顧客的本能的抉擇力，使其窩心信服。他若所謂［投機］［老牌子］等等，那是無關宏旨的枝節條件。就拿上海的幾種托拉司化的商業來講吧：××糖果店，××洋貨公司，ＸＸ國藥號，××茶店</p>
<p>，都有多至十餘爿，少亦有三五爿的支店，資本旣然雄厚，大幅的廣告更經常的在日報上登刋，於是顧客都向那兒擠，自然利市若干倍，業務非常發逹。其餘同行的一些小店子，我們只見不是這兒的關門召頂，便是那兒的淸底招盤。　　但如××筆墨莊，資本旣然雄厚，（支店無數）牛皮也吹得震天價嚮，却竟像綢緞公司，中式鞋店一樣的衰落了，這就爲的是中土文化衰替的原故：鋼筆頂替了毛筆，洋服頂替了中装，革履頂替了布鞋，這是一個例外的有關國家大計的大問題，此地不能具論。</p>
<p>講到文化，廣告更其成了文化的俘虜，說得賣勁點，現代的文化，幾乎是廣告文化了，若不借助於廣告，便會和小商店一樣的打不開門徑。</p>
<p>××的白濁丸，雖是若干代的祖傳，奏效奇靈，但還需經常的在各報上用特種字樣大登其廣告，要這樣才使得愛國同胞偶患白濁，便撬開錢櫃，趕快去買××的白濁丸，一盒斷根：即使一盒未斷根，（顯然不與廣告所吹的靈）也會這樣自慰：［大槪是病入膏盲，需要再服一盒。］</p>
<p>××大醫士仁心濟世，在未懸壼之前，總要轉挽幾位要人名流先登一張介紹廣告。作者曾在Ｃ城患過一次病，請位醫生來看，他不受酬，只說要我將來在報上登一則鳴謝啓事，可惜他並未診好我的病，啓事我也至今未登。</p>
<p>只看這等醫藥方面的文化的幾則例子，就可知廣告魔力之大了。（醫藥事業是廣義的文化之一）</p>
<p>且瞧，時代是一九三三年暑季，在教育界正是各校忙於招生，在出版界是小學教科書太傾銷以及一般刋物書報的勃興，這不但是「九一八］［一二八］以來的盛况，直是近三四年來所未有的熱閙。</p>
<p>學校招生要登廣告是必需的，但儘可不必在廣告上大吹法螺，董事長是××名流，校長是××博士，校景怎樣，課程如何實用，歷史如何悠久等，統統吹登上去，目的就在炫亂投考者的眼目。更有在教育新聞裏大登其便宜廣告的，這樣才不難拉進學生。</p>
<p>教科書登廣告，必然的要將各方拉來的評語印上去，而且必然的要把作評者的職銜││什麽專家司長教育局長印上去，其實那所謂評語，都是幾句通套話。竟往往在别家的教科書廣告上民同樣看到，這就是一些好老先生把評語給了這家，又塞進那家討要的人的用裏，致有如此笑話。没有别的，傾銷要靠廣告宣傳，外化出路根本在於廣告。</p>
<p>出版刋物書報，必然的要請名人題簽，名畫家畫封面，把老作家的名字特别提出招搖。再版時必然的要編［好評］［束］，僞造讀者褒獎書信，自己拿出來瞎吹瞎捧。</p>
<p>總之，文化要靠廣告招搖，這是現階段文化的特徵，也是現階段上的文化的必然歪曲。</p>

<p>京杭國道一通，往來於此間的旅客，很不少的將火車輪船，改乘汽車，這上海的汽車站，就附設於滬閔南柘的車站内，在下世居松江，就業滬上，上星期一的早上，從松江偕友搭長途汽車到滬，目的地旣到，黃包車夫照例蜂擁着兜攔生意，以兩毫的代價，由他拉到四馬路上，兩輛以人當馬的車，正奔馳向前，在理我寫到這裏，除了寫些華界的建設如何進步和戰後的市面如何恢復外。别的花樣也難描慕的了，其實事不盡然，當車子到華界司法機關以前稱爲地方廳，目下呌做上海地方法院之前，二匹人而馬的車夫，忽將車子停住，對我說，先生：太陽這樣熱烈的晒着，我替你把篷子撑了起來遮了罷，說時遲那時快，他半個身體，已緊壓在我的身上了，眼看他一手撑篷，並聽得他嘴裏嚷着；呀！篷子壞了！同時並覺得我短衫衣袋邊，有一粗笨的外來的力向我那只錢夾進攻·哈哈·在下雖没有闖過三關，開過碼頭，可是到那時便也識透他們玄妙了，便立刻用警告式的語意問他做什麽，豈料事有出人意料的正多着，他當時非但不中止他的行爲竟用强搶式的舉動，欲得那他的目的物（錢夾），這時我便跳下車和他交涉，方斷了他的念頭，同時，我那位朋友也遇到同樣舉動，可是他那篇文章的入題，是以撩長衫爲名，而扒竊是實，事後兩相談及，方知這一段的黃包車夫，大半兼着這一份差使，如故一人得手，被事主呌喊，他們羣來相勸，其主義是將得手車夫放走，而以極低代價拉此失主到老西門，故他們車子上的照會，也祇有華界的，其所以欲接租界上的生意也祇不過欲從中做此手脚之後，再替你拉到華租交界之地，代喚一輛的到租界上的車子而已，至於他們下手的時候，距離巡警的崗位是很遠的·所以即使你呌喊，時耳目也難週的。</p>
<h3 id="c248">他們已能在生活戰綫上得到勝利 <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 傑克</p>
<p>這是天天過路看見的［××居士命相館］的牌子，在門口的兩旁；評着［某要人］的貴造，［××將軍］的貴格，等等字樣。此外還懸掛着時代要人的尊像，五顔六色没有次序的排列着。</p>
<p>隨時過路，至少都有一個給他相着，或在干支裏找着那天·［運轉鴻鈞］？［財帛交順］？奇怪：自政府奠定南京後：中央黨部曾三番五次的命令各省縣市鎭嚴重取締［星卜］［命相］之舉，爲甚麽在這通都大邑；不怕就是國府所在的南京，││現在夫子廟也不少還做着這樣的生意。政府没有眞的取締，不然靠着這生活不少的文人，也祗好到馬路上去求老爺呌太太了。可是眞正的老爺太太們。並在不馬路上，在馬路上走的是一種極平常人</p>
<p>看他的生意還不錯，測字一角，相面二角，談命四角，流年細批一元，······的價目，我也來犠牲一隻角子，無聊的和他談談，也可以探問他的生活狀况。走進去，他看見我：</p>
<p>［先生看個相，請坐，貴姓？·····］我也和他周旋了一套，他開始皺着眉，有仔細的看過一番：</p>
<p>『先生這個相，是「聰敏之相」眞千中無一，但傷尅父母，定是「父在母先亡」是吧』？我㣲點點頭，於是他更驕傲的：</p>
<p>『你對朋友極忠實，可是吃得苦却受不得氣；做事業祇是有虚名，儲蓄不起錢來，今年被小人剥害，主有點口舌；大運要到明年才名利亨通·····』的話。</p>
<p>末了，我在腰包裏搯出一個角子給他：</p>
<p>「先生命相每天可得若干潤資」？</p>
<p>「哈哈！熬煎得很，好來三四元，冷落可得一二塊錢。一二塊錢，這多末夠我們同是絞腦汁的作何感想？但他對被相者，或求批命者的仙言妙語；這是對任何靑年，或另一種人都大致不會差的雙管話。不怪一般愚夫愚婦都稱讚他們是活神仙，無時無刻的去求拜。</p>
<p>據報載：「某某預言家到滬，下榻南京路××旅社，每日乘湃汽車踵門求相卜者；不下數十人」的話。我想：在現代的中國，公然也有這種人在生活戰綫上得到勝利，與一般富貴要人並駕齊軀出入於大旅社，住每月十數元的房間，這可見中國學家（我稱他們是中國科學家）得一般「富翁」「要人」的崇拜了，眞不愧是馳名的「神州古國」。</p>

<p>— 妍妍女士</p>
<p>一天，我和七歲大的妹妹到虹口公園去·</p>
<p>鞦韆架是最値得兒童眷戀的，的確不錯，輕輕地擺盪，大有飄飄欲仙之槪，更有㣲和的夏風吹着，多麼舒暢，快意！</p>
<p>站在鞦韆架旁的孩童己經有五六個，我的妹妹因爲先來，能夠佔行一個位置，她大約要了二十分鐘，旁邊一個日本婦人帶着兩個小孩子，好㣲笑着用很上海口音的話對我說：</p>
<p>「支那小姐！請你的妹妹停一息，讓我的小囡白相一下，等等還把儂！」</p>
<p>我本無可無不可，只是心中略有些踟蹰，因爲在旁邊别的中國兒童也曾向我預約過，現在幾個孩子都想搶着玩，我不知先讓給誰好，</p>
<p>她見我無表示，更進一句說話：</p>
<p>「我比他們先來，這裏是公園啊！」</p>
<p>她說「公園」兩字，來得特别大聲。好像呌我認請那裏是公園，應該懂點規則，不錯，她的確比他們先來照道理應該先讓給她的，只是國家觀念盤旋在我腦中，怎不令我踟蹰不决呢？</p>
<p>終於我呌妹妹讓給那個日本婦人，但是一種責備的聲音即時傳進我底耳中　　「你怎麽讓給她，不讓給自己中國人呢？眞是十足的亡國奴·····」</p>
<p>我給他們這一駡，頓時心中紛亂起來，懺悔不該讓給日人，但打算和他們辯駁，連自己也不知道想些什麽話，只覺得眼前有些發黑，</p>
<p>公園中再不能立足了·我攙着妹妹的手，拼命地跑出公園，跳上一輛將要開的「一路」公共汽車，</p>
<p>車輪在顫動，同時我的心還在忐忑不定，</p>

<p>聾了耳朶就不能做事麽？編者先生：</p>
<p>我有一個很難解决的事，早就就想要寫信來請教你，因爲我不會寫信，恐怕你不能入目；現在的我，整夜徬徨，没有其他辦法了；所以我祇好不厭一切，寫這封來請教你了，諒你總不至於拒絕我的要求嗎？請你不吝珠玉，誠實地指導我的迷途吧！當我在十九歲的時候（即民十九年）曾任烟公司小職員。可是我不幸得很，服務不到半年，遂生了一塲死去復活的大病；後來病終於好了，但是我的耳朶因病致聾·鳴聲隆隆，痛苦不堪。自己懊喪莫名·萬念俱灰的當兒·公司停了我生意。這當然不容分說，祗好去吃我的家鄉米飯了。</p>
<p>荏苒光陰，怱怱地過了三年，在這三年中，曾就過不少名醫的診察。但是一些也没有見效，然所耗已不資矣。無形中添了不少經濟壓迫，家道日落，難免時起糾紛，冷嘲熱諷，非人所能忍。迫不得已，終於今春三月間，來身投親託薦，不料至今百謀不遂，這也許是我老聾的緣故吧？想你先生，見聞多廣，一定可已解釋我這個難題的；未知滬上有没有專科老聾的醫生，請你介紹我吧！倘使能夠脫雖這苦海的一名話，那我就感激五中了；若果已成不治之症，那没我想請教你第二步，對於聾者有什麽事可以服務呢？或在短時間内，有什麽工業可以學？倘若無一能者，這社會就没有我的立足之地了？這是我最後唯一的希望，千萬請你給我一個福音吧。敬請撰安　　任振聲謹上</p>
<p>×　×　×　×　×</p>
<p>編者按；耳聾的原因，大槪可以分爲兩種：第一種爲聽器官之畸形殘缺，障礙，或壞損。屬於這一類的耳聾，除了少數很簡單的症象外，都半是無法治療的。近世雖有人發明一種很精密的擴音器，謂御之者即能返聾爲聰；但尙在試騐時代，未可普徧採用。第二種爲體質虚損，因以影響聽神經，致使聽覺全失者。屬於這一類的耳聾，十九倒有可以治愈的希望。因爲假使我們用了藥石，使體質日漸强壯，聽神經自然會逐漸活躍起來。</p>
<p>任君的耳聾，是否可以治愈，最好要去請教有本領的西醫診斷過：據我們知道本埠四川路靑年對面，人一個德國醫生，名字呌做惡克斯者，對於眼耳鼻舌科很有把握，你大可以去請他診斷一次，問他可有醫治把握没有？</p>
<p>萬一診斷的結果，不幸是［無法治療］，那你也不要灰心，說什麽［世界就没有我立足之地］等絕話。要知道天下配聾子去做的事正多；而且有幾件事情，竟有［非聾不辦］的呢！至於要具體的逐項寫下來，那末非這裏的篇幅所容，而且你能不肥夠如願找到，以及你是否可以勝任，均有問題。所以我在這裏，把你的信公開發表；希望這廣大的社會中的會伸出一只仁慈的手來提挈你！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Feng Yuxiang Goes to Tai'an <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The special train left Zhangjiakou yesterday morning</p>
<p>Song Zheyuan accompanied him to Huangcun</p>
<p>Han Fuju arrived in Dezhou to greet him</p>
<p>Before departure, the personnel of the Zhangjiakou headquarters were dismissed</p>
<p>A speech was delivered to the reporter group in Fengtai</p>
<p>(Beiping) At about 4:00 AM this morning, Feng Yuxiang's special train left Zhangjiakou heading east, accompanied by Song Zheyuan, who also led over a thousand guards. Besides Peng Guozheng's group, there were over two hundred of Feng's guards, heading directly to Tai'an to protect Feng. The special train arrived at Xizhimen Station at 12:55 PM. Liu Zhizhou, Deng Zhexi, Tai Dechun, Yu Zhihan, Li Qi, Zhang Jiyong and others also came along. He, representing Huang Jianqun, Huang, representing He Qigong, and Xiong Bin, Men Zhizhong, Xu Ying, Zhang Zizhong, Feng Zhi'an and others, all came to the station to welcome him. Feng was wearing a blue Chinese-style short jacket, his face slightly dark, holding a large banana leaf fan in his right hand, and a large envelope in his left hand. He bowed to the welcomers in thanks. The train stopped for five minutes and then headed east. Qin Dechun and several others got off the train, and the rest continued with the journey. At 1:30 PM, they arrived in Fengtai. Han Fuju had already sent three armored trains of the "Mount Tai" type, led by Liu Chun'en, the captain of the Second Artillery Team, to Fengtai in advance. Han also sent his adjutant, Meng, to welcome Feng with the armored train. After Feng arrived in Fengtai, he delivered a speech to the Tianjin and Beiping reporter groups. At 2:15 PM, they headed east. Two armored trains went ahead to clear the way, and one followed behind Feng's special train. Song sent a platoon of soldiers to escort them. After Feng left, Song and the others returned to Beiping. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Feng Yuxiang left Zhangjiakou for Tai'an on the morning of the 14th, accompanied by Song. Zhang Weifan of the Construction Department assumed his duties. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Fang Zhenwu is in Zhangbei, and Ji Hongchang has another organization in Duolun. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Han Fuju sent two empty trains to Beiping on the morning of the 14th to welcome Feng, with one armored train attached to each train. Feng's train arrived at Langfang at 2:00 PM on the 14th. Feng got off the train to go to the Northwest Army Martyrs Shrine, where he mourned for a long time. He arrived in Tianjin at 9:00 PM. Deng Zhexi got off the train and said that Feng had a cold, and rejected all welcomers. Then the locomotive was changed, and the train headed south on the Jinpu Railway. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Han Fuju sent a telegram to Beiping this morning, saying that he had arrived in Dezhou to welcome Feng. (14th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Feng said, "I arrived in Chahar on October 10th last year, and it has been ten months. My actions in Chahar this time were aimed at external affairs and had no internal ambitions. Now I have recovered the lost territory in eastern Chahar and returned it to the country. My personal goal has been achieved. The Allied Army fought fiercely in the battle of Duolun, with over 1,600 soldiers killed or wounded. I have built a memorial tower and shrine for the anti-Japanese martyrs on the old site of Zhang Zhijiang's residence in Zhangjiakou, and held a twelfth ceremony of worship. When I left Zhangjiakou, Duolun was still very peaceful. The Japanese army had not yet attacked, only Japanese planes came to scout from time to time. The puppet army stationed near Duolun was Li Shouchun's unit, about seven or eight thousand people. Li sent a representative to Duolun to ask if our army was still attacking Rehe. If we wanted to attack, he was willing to be the vanguard. Japan has recently sent people to Li to try to persuade him, but Li said that he was Chinese and did not want to be bought by Japan, so if we handle it properly, Li will not attack Duolun with the Japanese army." When reporters asked Feng about his thoughts on national affairs, Feng replied, "In these times, it is not good to talk about mutual forgiveness." Finally, Feng said that the military and political affairs of Chahar Province had been completely handed over to Song. Fang Zhenwu lives in Wanquan. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Song Zheyuan left Chahar, the military affairs of Zhangjiakou were jointly handled by Tong Linge and Tian Chunfang, the deputy commander of the 37th Division. The troops of Feng's unit are now all assembled and stationed in Zhangbei, Guyuan, and Duolun. The Central Army units of Guan Linzheng and Wang Jingjiu are stationed south of Xuanhua and in Zunhua and other places. Song has sent personnel to Zhangjiakou and Guyuan to express condolences to Feng's troops, and instructed them to temporarily defend their original positions and await further instructions. Fang's artillery division had already been reorganized, and the reorganization of Zhang Renjie's division has been completed. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Pang Bingxun returned to Beiping from Xuanhua at around 8:00 AM this morning and did not get to meet Feng. After Song left Zhangjiakou to come to Beiping, the government affairs of Chahar Province were handled by Yang Zhennan, the secretary-general of the provincial government. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Feng Yuxiang, Song Zheyuan, and their party left Chahar by special train at 4:02 AM on the 14th, heading to Shandong, accompanied by Guo Zhihan, Tai Dechun, Deng Zhexi, Li Xin, and a company of guards. They made slight stops in Xuanhua and Nankou. At 12:30 PM in the morning, they passed through Beiping and arrived at Xizhimen Station, where over thirty people, including Xiong Bin, He Qigong, Liu Jianqun, Fu Rulin, Men Zhizhong, and Cheng Xixian, were at the station to welcome them. Feng was wearing blue cloth short clothes and pants, with a rich appearance, unkempt hair and no beard, showing a state of dust and travel. After the train stopped, Xiong Bin, Fu Rulin, He Qigong, Liu Jianqun, and others boarded the train to talk. After stopping for ten minutes, they continued on to Fengtai, and then transferred to the Jinpu Railway heading south. Han Fuju sent an armored train of the "Mount Tai" type and a special train, each, which arrived in Fengtai at 5:00 AM on the 14th to welcome them, and also sent Cheng Xixian and artillery team leader Liu Chun'en to take care of them along the way. At 1:15 PM in the afternoon, they arrived in Fengtai, and the party transferred to the special train sent by Han Fuju to go to Ji'nan. Song Zheyuan accompanied them to Huangcun, and then turned back to Beiping to meet with He Yingqin to report everything and ask for instructions on the post-Chahar policy. Whether Feng will reside in Mount Tai will be decided when he arrives in Ji'nan. When Feng's train passed through Fengtai, at the request of the reporters, he personally came out to meet them, holding a cattail leaf fan, and said to the reporters, "Since I arrived in Chahar on the Double Tenth Festival last year, it has been more than ten months, and I have always adhered to the principle of not pointing the gun at our own people, hoping to recover the lost territory and return it to the country. What I said there, I did there. We have about 1,600 casualties in the anti-Japanese war. We have built a monument and a shrine in Duolun, and built a public cemetery to bury the fallen soldiers. The day before yesterday, we held a joint ceremony with the various agencies and groups in Chahar Province, which was quite lively. There are now six or seven thousand people in Li Shouchun's unit near Duolun. Li sent a representative to say to me, 'Mr. Feng, if you attack Rehe, we can be the vanguard.' The Japanese side is now pressuring them to attack Duolun. They said to the Japanese, 'We are all Chinese and cannot point our guns at our own people.' The Japanese said, 'If you do not attack Rehe, Japan will not attack Duolun.' Duolun is still in our hands, but Japan sends planes to drop bombs every day. I personally have no great feelings about the future of China. You reporters understand better than I do, so I don't want to say it. Whether I will reside in Mount Tai on this trip to Shandong has not yet been decided. Fang Zhenwu has gone to Wanquan County, and I have not heard whether he will come to Beiping. The post-Chahar military and political affairs have been handed over to Song Zheyuan. I am here this time like planting a single sorghum stalk on ten acres of land, called a 'unique seedling.'" After Feng finished speaking, he laughed loudly and asked his entourage to take a basket of apples purchased from Nankou and distribute them to the reporters. Feng then stood up at this time, bowed, and said, "Sorry, goodbye!" (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan and others originally planned to accompany Feng to Tianjin before returning to Beiping, but Feng repeatedly stopped them, so they only went as far as Huangcun, where Song bid farewell to Feng, Feng Zhi'an, and Zhang Zizhong. Feng was accompanied to Shandong by Zhang Jiyong, Cheng Xixian, and Li Qi and others. Song arrived in Beiping at about 7:00 PM. Tonight, he will visit He Yingqin with Tai Dechun to report on the situation after the takeover and discuss the post-affairs measures. Song is scheduled to return to Zhangjiakou within a few days. This afternoon at 4:00 PM, a group of Feng's guards, traveling on one train, transferred from the Ping-Sui Railway to Fengtai and headed south to Shandong. The armbands they wore were all changed to the attached number of the Twenty-Ninth Army. After Feng left, the security of the various armies in Chahar Province has been ordered to remain stationed in their original positions and await orders. Currently, Ji's unit is still in Duolun, Fang's unit is in Wanquan, and Sun Liangcheng himself is in Zhangbei. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Zhangjiakou said that Qin, Deng, Li, and others sent a telegram to Han on the morning of the 12th, asking if Feng could return to Mount Tai to reside. Han replied by telegram that evening, and also wired 25,000 yuan from Ji'nan as dismissal expenses for the headquarters. On the morning of the 13th, Feng summoned the personnel of the headquarters to the Zisheng Hall in Xincun to give instructions, and distributed dismissal expenses separately. Qiu Shanning, the chief of general staff of the headquarters, will remain in Zhangjiakou temporarily to handle the post-affairs, and all other personnel will leave Zhangjiakou. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When Feng Yuxiang issued the Shi telegram, his attitude was still quite strong, but by the time of the Ge telegram, it had softened somewhat. According to insiders, there were three reasons: 1) He was threatened by the armies that entered Chahar, 2) internal divisions, and 3) the Communists attacked Feng severely. Feng began to feel the difficulties at this point and suddenly developed the intention to withdraw. However, he still had no determination to leave Zhangjiakou until he issued the Ma telegram. After Pang's army suddenly advanced and stationed in Xuanhua, Song urgently sent Qin Dechun and two groups to Zhangjiakou, and personally went to persuade Feng to leave Zhangjiakou on the 12th. Because Han had already sent a telegram asking Feng to go to Mount Lu to live, and Song also strongly guaranteed his safety when passing through Beiping and Tianjin, Feng decided to head south. The Chahar situation dissipated at this point. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>=There are Still 280 Japanese Soldiers Stationed in Tangshan=</p>
<p>(Tangshan) Liu Shirun passed through Tangshan on the 14th at noon and arrived in Yu at night, where he contacted the Luoge River Garrison Commander. Linyu County has prepared to move back to Shanhaiguan in the next few days, and to take over various agencies. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Liu Shirun went to Shanhaiguan this morning. Xue Zhiheng went to Tangshan this evening to handle all outstanding matters. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Tangshan says that there are currently 287 Japanese soldiers stationed in Tangshan, affiliated with the Tianjin Garrison Headquarters, commanded by Battalion Commander Yamagata. The battalion headquarters is located at Jiaotong University. It was recently heard that Battalion Commander Yamagata will be returning to his country, and Staff Officer Asami, a lieutenant colonel dispatched from Tokyo, has come to replace him.

<p>Dams Everywhere Being Rushed to Repair</p>
<p>Floods Reach the Western Border of Heze</p>
<p>Construction Committee and Jiangsu Provincial Government Send Personnel to Henan for Inspection</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Railway news: The water level of the Yellow River in Henan has dropped, and the danger period has passed. Traffic on the Longhai Railway is normal. A telegram from Dangshan reports that the overflowing water in eastern Henan has also stabilized after entering the Liu River. However, Caoxian in southern Shandong has recently suffered severe flooding due to river breaches, which is quite dangerous, but will not affect northern Jiangsu. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sun Qingze, Director of the Yellow River Bureau, telegraphed the provincial government that the second breach has been blocked, and the first breach is being rushed to block. However, he recently received a telegram from Shaanxi that a water surge of over ten feet high is flowing down, which is alarming. He fears that if this water reaches the territory, there will be unimaginable danger. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) The water level of the Yellow River in Henan Province continued to fall on the 13th and 14th. Many dams along the river have collapsed, and repairs are being actively carried out. Liu Zhi sent the provincial committee member Wan Wu and Liu Yaoshang to the disaster-stricken counties to provide relief with funds. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The breach on the south bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan divided the water into two streams. Today it has reached the western border of Heze. One stream flows northwest from Guanyuanji towards Wudian in the north of the city, and the other flows from Weilou past Gaozhuang towards Wudian. The magistrate of Heze County, together with the principals of agricultural schools and self-defense class students from various townships, are helping the villagers to desperately defend and repair at Liuzhuang and Zhukou on the border between Hebei and Shandong. The water trending towards Caoxian is also divided into two streams, one south of the city and one north of the city. If Kaocheng breaches again and the water reaches Caoxian again, Heze will become a flooded area. Furthermore, the breaches in Kaocheng are one at Yanmiao, over forty zhang wide, and one at Wu Wucai village, over thirty zhang wide, with a very strong flow. The upper reaches of the Yellow River in this province have dropped by 1.37 meters compared to the previous high water, so there is no longer cause for concern. This afternoon, the water level at Luokou was 29.9 meters. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Yellow River water overflowing from Lanfeng in eastern Henan has eased after entering the Liu River as of the morning of the 14th. The amount of water flowing into the old course of the Yellow River is quite small, and the downstream sand is relatively high. With Song arriving in Xuzhou, it is not expected to harm Jiangsu. The people of Xuzhou are at peace. The number of passengers on the Longhai Railway between Xuzhou and Bian has decreased sharply in recent days, all fearing water damage near Lanfeng and Guide. Recently, trains have been running as usual, and the number of passengers is gradually recovering. All submerged telegraph poles are exposed, and communications have not been interrupted. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) The water of the Yellow River continues to recede. The river water overflowing from Lanfeng into Shangqiu territory has come to a standstill. Investigations show that the water depth in Kaocheng is three feet. Liu Zhi has ordered the River Relocation Bureau and the county magistrates along the river to expedite the construction of embankments while the water is receding, without negligence, and to record the merits, dismissals, rewards, and punishments of those responsible for this river management. He has also sent Wan Wu and Liu Yaoshang to inspect Mengjin and the flooded counties, and sent He Fuqing to Lanfeng to distribute emergency relief. (14th Central Telegram)</p>

Wang told reporters that after arriving in Lu, he learned that the Chahar affair had gradually come to an end, but the loss of Duolun on the 7th was a matter of great pain. Now Feng has handed over the political power of Chahar Province to Song for handling, but he has not yet expressed agreement with the titles given by the central government. During this time in Lu, Chairman Chiang and I discussed several times and drafted different positions for him to take on, but we have not been able to satisfy him, so we are still continuing to solicit his opinions. As for whether he will go to Mount Tai for recuperation, I have not heard of it. As for the issue of the southwestern committees participating in the Fifth National Congress, the central government sent personnel to explain it, and they have long been understood. As for the rumor that there is opposition again recently, I have not heard of it in Lu. Furthermore, Tang Youren said that the issues of the allocation and safekeeping of the American cotton and wheat loan will be decided after Song returns to the country. As for Japan's suspicion that we are cooperating with the League of Nations, it is because they fear that our country will use this huge sum of money for military construction or to the detriment of their aggressive policies, but we are actually seeking domestic economic construction, and the facts will soon prove it. As for Rachman accompanying Song to China, the rumor that he has canceled his trip due to Japanese opposition is not true. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Banks Seek to Recover Loans</p>
<p>(Nanjing) When the banks in Beijing closed their accounts last year, the overdraft loans to various money houses reached a huge sum of over two million yuan. The banks are seeking recovery from the money houses, resulting in an extremely tight money market. All the money houses are in a precarious state. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce plans to remedy the situation. The flow of finance is usually from banks lending to money houses, and then from money houses lending to various shops. After the September 18th Incident, the purchasing power of citizens was completely lost, resulting in the goods purchased by the shops being unable to be sold. The money houses, in their position as indirect creditors, have become mostly stranded. The banks still continue to demand repayment based on legal interest rates. The money houses, as the main mechanism for circulating finance, are likely to repeatedly urge the shops to repay their debts. The fundamental monetary market in the capital has been shaken. The Social Bureau has indeed issued two principles for remediation: 1) Banks that have already made loans will temporarily not pursue them. 2) Continue to make loans to temporarily fund the market. However, these have not yet been implemented. The members of the Qian industry have jointly petitioned the reorganization committee of the Chamber of Commerce, requesting a meeting to be convened to jointly seek relief. At this time of transition between the old and the new committee, it is not possible to take care of it. It is now scheduled to hold the second reorganization committee meeting on the 16th, when it will be formally raised for discussion. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>The Seiyukai Persists in Policy Coordination</p>
<p>As a Condition for President Suzuki's Entry into the Cabinet</p>
<p>The Issue of Minister Without Portfolio Encounters Snags</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The reason for the stagnation of the issue of ministers without portfolio entering the cabinet is due to differing opinions regarding the primacy of policy coordination versus the primacy of entering the cabinet. The Seiyukai insists on focusing on policy coordination, while the Minseito is unwilling to coordinate policies. Finance Minister Takahashi also advocates for entering the cabinet without conditions. Judging from this situation, it is difficult for Prime Minister Saito to disregard these various circumstances and propose a compromise on policy coordination to the Seiyukai. Moreover, if the Seiyukai does not coordinate policies, it will naturally not agree to enter the cabinet. In that case, this issue can only be dropped. On the other hand, if Prime Minister Saito continues to raise this issue, it will provoke the issue of Minister of Education Hatoyama's responsibility, or even take advantage of a change in the cabinet's stance toward the Seiyukai, leading to a sudden and significant outcome, which may be detrimental to the political situation. Furthermore, Minister of Education Hatoyama, based on past relationships, cannot bury this issue in ambiguity. Prime Minister Saito also has to consider alternative strategies. Therefore, at today's meeting between Prime Minister Saito and Minister Hatoyama, the government may propose coordinating policies regarding the draft budget for the next fiscal year. However, the issue will become increasingly complicated from this point on. (Fourteenth Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito invited Minister of Education Hatoyama to the Prime Minister's residence at 10:05 AM today, informing him that the issue of establishing a minister without portfolio would be temporarily suspended due to the timing being premature. Minister Hatoyama requested that the matter of ministers without portfolio could be suspended, but policy coordination between the government and the Seiyukai was a separate issue and must be pursued regardless of the minister without portfolio issue. Policy coordination was necessary to strengthen the current cabinet, so he hoped it could be resolved before the budget cabinet meeting. Thus, although the issue of ministers without portfolio has been suspended, the issue of policy coordination will become another obstacle. Furthermore, Minister Hatoyama stated after meeting with Prime Minister Saito that he had strongly emphasized the necessity of policy coordination to the Prime Minister, who fully understood. He also said that he had obtained President Suzuki's understanding on policy coordination, so if the Prime Minister and Finance Minister Takahashi agreed, it could be realized.

<p>(Tokyo) Whether policy coordination between the government and the Seiyukai can be established has become a problem. If policy coordination can be established now, the main policies proposed by the Seiyukai are as follows: (1) In order to foster the development of "Manchukuo," its finances must be actively assisted; (2) Establish a national economic policy based on cooperation between Japan and "Manchukuo"; (3) Establish a national defense plan with the aim of revising the London Treaty in 1936; (4) Establish the fundamentals of fiscal and economic policy; (5) Emphasize industrial monetary policy and thorough measures for low interest rates; (6) Ideological countermeasures; (7) Rectification of official and military discipline; (8) Maintenance of the current political structure; (9) Renewal of independent diplomacy.

<p>(Tokyo) Because the Seiyukai made policy coordination a condition for Suzuki to agree to take office as a minister without portfolio, and the Minseito advocated maintaining the status quo and opposed policy coordination, the views of the two sides differed greatly. Saito, who raised policy coordination as the first step, decided to temporarily not raise the issue to Prime Minister Saito. Today, Hatoyama accepted the proposal on the condition that the Minseito agreed. Hatoyama immediately visited Minister of Agriculture and Forestry Goto to raise the issue of policy coordination. It is expected that the Minseito will oppose it to the end, because the Seiyukai's true intention is to use the policy coordination meeting to put the cabinet in disunity and force Saito to step down voluntarily, in order to achieve the goal of overthrowing the cabinet. The Minseito regards Hatoyama's proposal as a conspiracy to overthrow the cabinet, so its future prospects are still not optimistic. (Fourteenth China United News Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e21">Conflicting Interests Among Factions, Financial Cliques and Military Cliques Engage in Power Struggles <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The issue of Seiyukai President Suzuki taking office as minister without portfolio has been shelved again because both Suzuki and President Wakatsuki have stated that they will not enter the cabinet. Regarding the future of the Japanese political situation, the conflicting interests among the various factions are very intense. The details are as follows: (A) [The Situation on the Seiyukai Side] (1) After the Yang Cabinet fell, the Seiyukai and the Mitsui financial clique behind it suffered huge losses. Compared to Mitsubishi, Mitsubishi has more military industries. Therefore, the war policy of the Araki faction benefits Mitsubishi less. (2) Mitsui's related light industries are numerous and emphasize trade. Due to the military's gunboat diplomacy, Japanese goods have also been greatly resisted overseas. (3) Mitsui controls many special privileges in Manchuria. After the Incident, it was hindered by the military and could not exclusively obtain huge profits. (4) The military oppresses the financial cliques and their tool political parties. Although Mitsui and Mitsubishi are equally subject to its remaining power, Mitsui suffers greater oppression. Finance Minister Takahashi's opposition to the military's tax increase policy is also for this reason. Due to the aforementioned four reasons, the Seiyukai is trying its best to overthrow the cabinet and replace it. Takahashi believes that in the current situation, if the Saito cabinet falls, the successor will definitely not be the Seiyukai. He fears that it will create an opportunity for the military cliques to create a dictatorial political regime. The reason why the Seiyukai supports ministers without portfolio lies in this. (B) [The Position of the Minseito] (1) The Minseito and its backer, the Mitsubishi financial clique, have been oppressed by the military cliques since the September 18th Incident, just like Mitsui and the Seiyukai. However, they have gained a lot from the war policy. (2) If Suzuki enters the cabinet through coordination, the new policy will create opportunities for the Mitsui financial clique. (3) If Suzuki does not enter the cabinet, the Seiyukai will split into factions around the next Diet session, and the party's power can be evenly distributed in the political arena, in order to win equal say in the next regime. The Minseito rejects ministers without portfolio for the aforementioned reasons. (C) [The Position of the Military] The content of the Japanese military is very complex. The views of the Araki faction and the Uehara faction are different, and their interests may not be the same. The Araki faction's position is as follows: (1) Although the military wants to create a military dictatorship, the current domestic and foreign situation is not yet ripe. Regarding domestic issues, if we take the opportunity to overthrow the cabinet and implement dictatorship, the financial cliques and political parties will inevitably resist desperately. Therefore, internal affairs will be in chaos. (2) If Suzuki enters the cabinet, the actual power will still be in the hands of the military, which is beneficial and harmless. (3) If the military hastily pursues dictatorship, international relations will become more difficult, and diplomatic pressure on Japan will inevitably increase, and isolated diplomacy will become increasingly isolated. (4) Taking advantage of the internal disputes in Japan, the diplomatic relations between China and Russia with Japan will become stronger, reducing its pressure. With the above four reasons, the military also agreed to Saito and Takahashi's proposal. Although there are many difficulties at present, the issue of ministers without portfolio will eventually be realized. (Fourteenth China United News Telegram)</p>

He also informed that the board of directors of the Ussuri Railway is willing to temporarily transfer direct transport goods before the issue of direct traffic resumption is resolved. The Soviet Russian directors of the Chinese Eastern Railway had to agree to this temporary measure, and hoped that direct joint transport would be restored as soon as possible. Subsequently, according to news from Khabarovsk, the transfer of import and export goods has been negotiated and agreed upon at the five stations where the Ussuri and Chinese Railways meet. It is reported that foreign exporters in northern Manchuria were very pleased after hearing the news that the two railways had agreed on temporary transfer measures, as this would hopefully restore the convenience of exporting goods through the port of Vladivostok in the past. They also learned that the Soviet Russian directors of the Ussuri Railway and the Chinese Eastern Railway do not object to transporting goods to Vladivostok for export in the future.

<p>The Policy Towards Manchukuo Remains Unchanged</p>
<p>Vowing to Be Buried in a Foreign Land</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The newly appointed Ambassador to Manchukuo and Commander of the Kwantung Army, General Hishikari, departed from Tokyo Station at 9:00 AM today to take office. In addition to the Imperial attendant military officer Ishida dispatched by the Emperor to see him off at the station, there were also Prime Minister Saito, Army Minister Araki, Navy Minister Osumi, Interior Minister Uchida, Minister of Railways Oyama, Minister of Overseas Affairs Nagai, Minister Yuasa, Chief of Staff Ueda, and over a thousand other officials and civilians. Amidst cheers of "Banzai," the train slowly departed. Hishikari will visit the Atsuta, Ise, and Momoyama Imperial mausoleums along the way, and will board the Ussuri Maru, which set sail from Kobe, at noon on the seventeenth to go to Dalian. (Fourteenth Den-tsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) General Hishikari departed from Tokyo Station at 9:00 AM this morning to take office. Councilor Tani Masayuki and other staff members accompanied him. Hishikari told reporters in the train, "I will inherit Marshal Muto's doctrine and policy, and I am determined to be buried in the wilderness of Manchuria. The policy towards Manchuria is completely a blank sheet of paper." The so-called blank sheet of paper means public opinion politics. The policy towards Manchuria should be considered from the perspective of the global situation with China, Russia, Britain, and the United States. I have two thoughts on the Manchuria issue. Japan should prohibit interfering in Manchuria and only be a negotiating partner, and observe the attitude and policy of Manchukuo. That is one. Every time Japan has a political change, it replaces the ambassador to Manchuria, which will definitely not lead to good results. This time, I am going to take office, determined to be buried in "Manchukuo," so I can calmly implement the policy towards Manchuria. That is two. (Fourteenth Japan United News Telegram)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Japan Considers Countermeasures for the Anglo-Indian-Japanese Trade Conference <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the British Proposals as Unfavorable to Itself</p>
<p>(Tokyo) With the Anglo-Japanese and Indo-Japanese conferences about to open, the Japanese Foreign Ministry and other ministries and related people from the private sector have repeatedly held meetings to consider countermeasures. However, because the true intentions of the British and Indian sides are unknown, the Foreign Ministry has issued new basic instructions to the Japanese representatives and will determine the detailed policy depending on the situation of the conference. The general outline of the Japanese countermeasures currently being formulated by the Foreign Ministry is as follows: a joint meeting will be held on the seventeenth to make a final decision. (1) The Indo-Japanese Simla Conference will discuss the sudden problems between the Indian and Japanese representatives, with the content reached being the final conclusion. (2) The Simla Conference will formulate a new treaty due to the expiration of the current Indo-Japanese trade treaty on October 10, with reciprocity as its aim, that is, to prevent the initiation of the Indian Business Protection Act with the new treaty. (3) The main topic of the conference will be cotton textiles. (4) Both Britain and India are excluding Japanese goods. Japan demands its reduction, and at the same time, Japan also expresses its sincerity in increasing purchases of Indian cotton, oil, hides, and other goods. (Fourteenth Japan United News Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British government's reply regarding the Anglo-Japanese-Indian private sector consultative conference to be held in London and Simla was sent to the Foreign Ministry by Ambassador Matsudaira today. The content is as follows: (1) The scope of the consultation includes markets in third countries other than Britain and Japan. (2) The items for consultation are not limited to cotton yarn and cloth, but also include rayon and blended fabrics. (3) The nature of the agreement is not clearly stated, and it seems to be attempting to set up a market agreement for distributing markets. The above three points are not consistent with the main interests and claims of Japanese businesses, and Japan's fundamental claims are: (1) An agreement on the markets of third countries is meaningless because it only concerns the interests of operators in third countries. (2) If competitors in the rayon industry, such as German and Italian rayon manufacturers, are not included, and only an Anglo-Japanese-Indian rayon agreement is concluded, it will be harmful and useless to the Japanese rayon industry. (3) The agreement is limited to the quantity of goods exported to British India and other territories by Britain, India, and Japan, but it opposes non-enforceable market distribution agreements and price agreements. Therefore, Japan is in a position where it cannot but oppose the British proposal, so it will immediately seek the opinions of businesses and become familiar with them.

<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Foreign Ministry plans to submit a list of representatives for the Simla Conference to the cabinet meeting tomorrow, seeking government approval. Tomorrow, Sawada, Morio, and Miyake will be officially appointed as Japanese representatives to India. The content of their instructions will be decided at a joint official-private consultation meeting on August 17, and then handed over to the three representatives.

<p>(Nanjing) The Tax Regulations Committee of the Ministry of Finance has been drafting the Customs Law for nearly half a year. Because our current customs duties are temporary regulations, drafting the Customs Law is a pioneering undertaking. This is a national law, so it is not appropriate to be careless. Although the matter belongs to the government, the interests of merchants must be taken into account. After collecting materials from all parties and investigating the import and export commercial situation, the facts of officials and merchants will be taken into account. Most of the drafting has been completed and is expected to be completed by the end of this year. What was passed by the Central Political Conference last time was the import tariff regulations, not the Customs Law. (Fourteenth Special Telegram)</p>

He is scheduled to visit Cao Haosen on the fifteenth, and then take a steamer to Jiangxi to visit Jiang that evening. Li said that he was going to Guling to visit Jiang to report on the recent situation of the Shaanxi military and government on behalf of Yang Shao. After completing his official duties, he will go to Nanjing. Shaanxi has been suffering from drought for five years, and the countryside is devastated. Recently, there has been a lot of rain, and there could have been a bumper harvest, but due to flash floods and rising water in the Yellow River, it has turned into a major disaster, killing thousands of people and causing huge losses. Fortunately, the local area is peaceful and the scattered bandits have been wiped out. Liu Zishu's group in eastern Shanxi has been annihilated, and bandit leader Wang Jiezi has been captured in western Shanxi. The territory is quite peaceful. Recently, the 17th Route Army is being reorganized. Wang Taiji, the commander of the cavalry regiment, was induced by reactionary elements and rebelled in Yaoxian on July 21, but the officers and soldiers refused to follow the rebellion and came back on their own. The matter has been settled. The Xu bandits in northern Sichuan are currently being jointly suppressed by Sun Weirun's troops in southern Shaanxi and the Sichuan army.

<h3 id="e33">Internal Water Worries and External Troubles <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>Fact</p>
<p>China has historically managed water. There are also so-called internal worries and external troubles. The emergency protection against hazards on the sea dikes is external, while the management of the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers is internal. If these internal and external water worries are not addressed with full force and a fundamental, large-scale treatment to eliminate the source of their disasters, then we will suffer every year, greatly affecting the national economy and the people's livelihood. Recently, there have been reports of urgent crises on the sea dikes in Baoshan and Chongming in Jiangsu Province. After Supervisory Yuan Commissioner Gao Yihan personally inspected the dike construction and witnessed its dangers, he made a special report to the central government. The main points included requesting the central government to allocate funds for emergency repairs, and requesting that a certain tonnage be allocated from the US cotton and wheat loan specifically for river and dike stone works. Furthermore, he ordered the Jiangsu Department of Finance to allocate the dike construction funds listed in the budgets after the 18th year of the Republic in full to prepare for the construction of dikes and embankments. If the country truly wants to defend against sea disasters and manage sea dikes, it must do so as Commissioner Gao said. Only with sufficient funds can we take action. However, at a time when the central government's finances are extremely tight, relying solely on the government's borrowing and allocation to accomplish a major task may be hopeless. Under these circumstances, if the sea dikes do not plan for remedies, the consequences will be disastrous once something happens. The people of Jiangsu Province, in order to protect their lives and property, can only quickly rise up to seek self-defense and exert all their efforts to assist the central government and share this huge responsibility with the government. This is the most important thing to pay attention to in defending against external threats.</p>
<p>As for the so-called major internal worry, the water level of the Yangtze River recently also warned of danger, causing fear among the people, as if the great disaster of the previous year would happen again. Fortunately, the water volume upstream naturally decreased, and it did not become a major disaster. Unexpectedly, the water level of the Yangtze River had just receded, and the water level of the Yellow River suddenly rose sharply. The rapid currents in Luoyang surged, and the northern section of the Pinghan Railway Yellow River Iron Bridge was scoured by the rapid currents. The bridge pier tilted eastward. According to the Railway Bureau, the slope has already tilted eastward by two centimeters, and the situation is already very dangerous. Even if the water level does not increase further, it is feared that it will not be able to be repaired within three to five days. The railway traffic between Pinghan has been greatly affected, not to mention the flooding of residents' fields and the destruction of houses along the river, the losses are incalculable. What we should pay attention to is Caozhou and eight counties in western Shandong besides Zhengzhou and Kaifeng. Several breaches have already occurred there, with water heads reaching a height of more than one zhang and coming with great ferocity. If the water does not flow through Hebei Province but enters Shandong from Caozhou, Shandong may be spared from the disaster. However, if it follows the old course and breaches the dikes between Kaifeng and Lanfeng and goes straight to Huaihai, then the people of eastern Henan will inevitably be buried in the pools of water, and the areas of Xuzhou and Haizhou will also be reduced to swamps. Northern Jiangsu, from Tongshan and Suining to Qingjiangpu, will all be subjected to the disaster. Furthermore, the people of the counties east of Tianjin have suffered greatly in the anti-Japanese war and are still recovering from their numerous wounds. Who would have thought that near Yutian, trenches crisscrossed and mountain torrents suddenly broke out, flooding more than 3,000 hectares of fertile land and submerging more than 200 villages? Baochi and Fengrun were also affected to a lesser extent. The upstream of the Yongding River also simultaneously experienced floods, with Xuanhua and Huailai being the most severe. This is something we cannot bear to describe in detail.</p>
<p>The danger of internal and external water disasters in China is like this. However, these water disasters did not start recently. Throughout history, government officials and people have studied water management plans. The books on this can be said to be abundant, but in the end, they are limited by talent and financial resources, or limited by busy personnel, and they have never considered this century-long plan. Once a disaster suddenly occurs, the so-called good officials can only temporarily work hard and desperately on emergency rescue and protection work. Fortunately, if it is effective, it will only be able to cope with temporary disasters. One of the most important words from water management experts of the past is: "Discharge is more important than defense." Whether it is managing the sea, the river, or the river, we must abandon the old method of building dams and blocking water, and start with guiding and dredging to make the water flow smoothly downstream. Only then can we avoid temporary busyness and lay the foundation for a century-long plan. In recent years, natural science has developed, and river and sea engineering has made amazing progress. If we all truly want to fundamentally manage and eliminate this continuous huge disaster, it may not be impossible. It depends on the determination of the Chinese people.</p>
<h3 id="e34">Central National Government Two Memorial Week Reports <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhenggan ···· Party and Political Power</p>
<p>Yu Youren ···· Rural Revival</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Party Headquarters held a memorial week at 8:00 a.m. on the 14th. Present were Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Chen Lifu, Chu Minyi, Gu Zhenggan, Li Ciwen, and central staff members, totaling about 600 people. Chairman Ye Chucang led the ceremony. Gu Zhenggan reported, stating in brief that in recent years, there have been loud calls for the opening of political power by the party. Party comrades hold different attitudes on how the party should approach political power, either advocating for openness and an early end to the period of political tutelage, or advocating for temporarily not opening up political power according to certain steps of political tutelage and constitutionalism. The reason is to prevent the reactionary faction from seizing political power and repeating the mistakes of the Xinhai Revolution. The starting point is out of love for the party and the country. However, in his personal opinion, he advocates for ending the period of political tutelage and opening up political power as soon as possible. Since the party came to power, it has coincided with domestic and foreign troubles in the country. All political responsibilities are attributed to the party, and the relationship between the party and the people has become that of ruler and ruled. At this time, based on party ideology and objective facts, it is necessary to establish a new policy. It is not necessary to rigidly adhere to the division of the period of absolute political tutelage and constitutionalism. Convening the National Assembly in advance is also a factual need, and opening up political power should not be interpreted as abandoning political power. Any political party that does not want to seize political power and maintain political power certainly does not want to abandon political power. The party is no different. Therefore, the issue is not whether to open up political power, but the party's ability and whether it has the support of the people. Now we should strive to enrich the party's strength and consolidate the party's foundation. Then, after opening up political power, the political power should still belong to the party. Also, when opening up political power, it should not be handed over to the reactionary faction, but to the revolutionary people. As for fearing that the reactionary faction will seize political power, there is no need to worry about it. (Central News Agency, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial week at 9:00 a.m. on the 14th. Present were Yu Youren, Lin Xiang, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Huang Musong, Chu Minyi, Lü Chao, and National Government staff members, totaling about 400 people. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Yu Youren reported, stating in brief that he often went outside Zhongshan Gate and saw many melon growers planting many melons, and the melons produced were also excellent, but the selling price was very low. Melon eaters were happy, but melon sellers were very bitter. Although this principle is not understood by farmers, it is actually a sign of rural bankruptcy. In recent years, our country has encountered domestic and foreign troubles, natural and man-made disasters. After the September 18th Incident, it was followed by the January 28th Incident. Recently, the war in Lai and North China has just ended, and then there were the troubles in Sichuan. The great flood of the 20th year has not yet recovered. This year, the Yellow River has also affected several provinces. The suffering of the people is deepening day by day. The sound of rural bankruptcy has spread throughout the country. The severity of the national crisis should not exceed today. Our country is founded on agriculture, and the foundation of the country is placed on hardworking farmers. The harvest of hardworking farmers is not enough to make a living, or even displaced and unable to live. People's livelihood is exhausted, endangering the foundation of the country, and the pain is deepening. As the saying goes, "Think of the pain after it is over," but just thinking about the pain does not help. We should think and do after the pain is over. We should consider how to do it to restore the pain. In addition, we should have a comprehensive plan for the rural revival plan and seek overall facilities. The government is not unwilling to seek relief, but only piecemeal, resulting in twice the effort and half the result. In the future, I hope that the government and the people of the whole country will do their best to restore the rural plan. The national crisis will eventually be eliminated.

<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that the Guangdong Committee's opposition to convening the Fifth National Congress only represents a part of the opinions of the party, which is a minor issue and does not have any impact on the congress itself. Recently, the Central Government may send personnel to explain the necessity of convening the Fifth National Congress on schedule. Although the war between China and Japan has ceased now, how to seek national unification and enrich national strength in the future to prepare for resisting foreign insults will depend on making an overall plan. It is an urgent matter to decide on such major issues at the Fifth National Congress. Even from this point of view, the Guangdong Committee should not disapprove. If the Guangdong Committee cannot attend at the time, the congress will be held as scheduled, because the number of attendees can meet the legal quorum. As for the number of members of the next Central Executive and Supervisory Committees, it will not be less than the fourth session. According to the fourth session, there were 178 people. If necessary, it will still be increased to expand recruitment. The Central Government is considering this and the final decision will be made at the congress. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) More than ten Guangdong youths formed the China Walking Group, planning to spend ten years walking across the country to investigate the living conditions of people in various places and the development of social undertakings. They departed from Guangdong on January 1, 1931, and walked for more than two years, passing through Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Guangxi, and Sichuan provinces, with a journey of about 27,000 miles. After the group arrived in Sichuan, it divided into two teams: Kangzang, Mongolia and Hui. The Kangzang team has reached the west of Xikang and is currently staying in Ba'an for investigation. The Mongolia and Hui team has reached Hebei province via Tibet, Qin, and Jin, and is expected to leave the Great Wall, passing through Suiyuan, Ningxia, Gansu, Qinghai, and Xinjiang, and meet with the Kangzang team before going to Inner and Outer Mongolia and the Northeast provinces, and then returning to the central provinces. The group is now running out of funds, and the luggage on the way was robbed by bandits. The road ahead is long and expensive, and they are afraid of being trapped by the economy, which will hinder their progress. Therefore, Dong Shuhua, director of the Mongolia and Hui team, and Liu Huifang, a member of the group, were sent to Beijing on the 14th to request assistance from the government and enthusiastic people from the society, so that they can complete their great feat of walking across the country as soon as possible. Dong and others plan to return to Zhangjiakou in about two weeks. (Central News Agency, 14th)</p>

<p>Cuban political leaders did not show significant resentment when they heard the news that the United States had sent warships. People from the faction of former President Machado, who usually most opposed American intervention, did not comment much today. The new president declared that the new government will maintain closer coordination with the United States, especially in economic matters, and broadcast by radio to the people to assure them that the new government will never be at the mercy of the United States, and will eliminate all dangerous forces.</p>

<p>Havana City is relatively peaceful today, and there are still occasional crowds searching for secret police from the former government. However, the fanaticism of the people's celebration has gradually decreased, and it is expected that it will soon return to normal. However, there is no sign of the end of the general strike. The labor unions, having overthrown the autocratic government, then proceeded to seek improvement in labor conditions, demanding increased wages, reduced working hours, and other better treatment. The new president has promised to do his best to seek it, and will live up to their expectations, but because he has no power to manage industry, he cannot directly promise. The authorities admit that persuading workers to resume work is the main problem today. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>Havana The American destroyer Taylor arrived here at 1:30 a.m. this morning. Ten minutes later, the destroyer Claxton also sailed past Moro Castle and entered the port. According to radio news, at that time, the destroyer Armistead had also sailed to a location 100 miles south of Florida and was coming here. Another destroyer, Sturtevant, was opening to Montagnillo from Balboa in the Panama Canal Zone. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The American president today sent three destroyers to Cuba to be stationed there to help maintain order when necessary. However, according to American Ambassador Welles' statement in the Cuban capital, American troops will never land unless the situation is critical and there is a need to land. The American president also explained that sending warships to Cuba has absolutely no intention of interfering, and only wants to help the Cuban authorities restore order. Now the Taylor and Claxton will depart from Charleston to Havana, and another warship will go to Montagnillo in Oriente Province. The name of the warship has not yet been announced.</p>
<p>According to reports, there is no serious disturbance in Cuba at this time, and the capital is peaceful as usual. There are also no reports of unrest in the provinces. Since former President Machado left the country, there have only been riots in Santa Clara and Camagüey, with one death in each location. The troops stationed in both places were able to disperse the rioters and maintain order. The trip of American warships to Cuba is probably intended to suppress. It is heard that the new Cuban President Cespedes is also completely willing to have American warships go to help in an emergency. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>

Although people from the Liberal Party admitted to maintaining the new government, they were unwilling to participate in the formation of a cabinet. However, the new government can still be formed quickly, and the important positions of the army, navy, and police have been given to those who have contributed to overthrowing Machado.

<p>(Washington) Some parties here believe that sending warships is enough to show that the American and Cuban authorities are worried that the revolutionary army in Oriente Province may attempt to seize Montagnillo and Santiago, because these people are not supporters of the current president, and have not yet surrendered and have no desire to surrender. Furthermore, former Cuban President Menocal and his 30,000 followers scattered near Miami have long boasted that they can start a revolution in Cuba as soon as a message is sent, but as of tonight, there is still no indication of support for Cespedes, which shows that he himself still intends to be president, and his followers are not satisfied with obtaining government positions. Therefore, there is still a possibility that there will be an uprising against the new government in Cuba. As for the followers of former President Machado, most of them have submitted to the new dynasty and are unlikely to be resurrected. It is heard that the American government's attitude is that if Cespedes handles state affairs with reasonable progress, the United States will not allow the revolutionaries to disturb him. The American government believes that the purpose of the general strike in Cuba is not only to expel Machado, but also to protest the treatment of workers as the main reason. Therefore, the new government faces great challenges and it is not easy to deal with the aftermath. But if it can be clean, loyal, and progressive, the American government will listen to what it does. According to reports, Cespedes was originally the candidate for acting president first proposed by American Ambassador Welles during the mediation, while former President Menocal did not send a representative to participate in the negotiations between the opposition party and the Machado government.

After arriving in the United States, they will inspect American machines, and several of them will pay special attention to American textile machines. The cotton purchased with the $40 million loan from Russia has already been shipped. Personnel from the Agricultural Adjustment Administration now expect Russia to continue to purchase cotton and textile machines in the United States. At present, the power of those in the United States who stubbornly oppose the recognition of Russia is weakening. The Russian-American Relations Research Committee, organized by General Electric Company's General Manager Moner and Raymond and other businessmen, was originally established to study the possibility of selling goods to Russia, and has now moved on to the study of political recognition.

According to reports, this news was recently spread by Japanese newspapers, saying that the United States is negotiating with the Mexican government to build a naval base there. Several years ago, there was a claim that Japan intended to find a naval base on the western coast of Lower California, but today, Mexican Foreign Ministry officials pointed out that the Mexican government has recently recovered 4,000 acres of land in the bay, most of which was owned by American expatriates. However, the Mexican government did not mention what it would do with the land after recovering it. It is expected that if Mexico uses it as a naval base, it will not be of much value. However, if the United States uses it as a naval base, it will be enough to shield the Panama Canal. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>

This ship was flying the American flag, and the sailors were Chinese speakers who spoke a southern dialect. According to Chinese coolies, this ship unloaded goods. However, according to other sources, this ship smuggled arms into the country, including ten machine guns, several mortars, six automatic rifles, and a large amount of ammunition. It is also heard that these smuggled arms were transported to Phoenix City by small cart, and the recipient of these arms was Li Zuying's Righteous Army, which is resisting Japan in the territory west of Phoenix City. The smugglers told people in the fishing village that the ship was flying the American flag and was under American protection, and the Japanese dared not interfere. They also claimed that the ship was escorted by an American warship and went straight to the Manchurian coast. In view of the frequent smuggling of arms into the country, the authorities have been extra vigilant in monitoring ships approaching the coast. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>Blue Shirts Hold Periodic Memorial for Martyrs</p>
<p>Valera Actively Prevents Disturbances</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 13th - General O'Duffy's National Executive Committee of the National Guard held its first meeting today to discuss the issue of commemorating revolutionary martyrs on August 20th. A unanimous decision was made to proceed as planned. This issue was raised by General O'Duffy, who advocated holding memorial services in churches across the country next Sunday. O'Duffy originally proposed a large parade of Blue Shirts today, but it was prevented by Valera, so the memorial service was rescheduled to be held in churches next Sunday. Last night, some young people gathered outside the National Guard headquarters and suddenly attacked the Blue Shirts as they came out, leading to clashes. However, the troublemakers were quickly dispersed by the police.</p>
<p>National, Dublin, 13th - Today, Sunday, has passed peacefully without any incidents. However, the tension of the situation has not lessened to this day. Police in various places are constantly patrolling fully armed. Armored vehicles are stationed at important locations in various cities. Soldiers in various military camps are also in full readiness. Furthermore, because the Blue Shirts declared that the destination of their march was the Irish Revolutionary Martyrs Memorial in front of the Parliament, Valera's old troops, armed with live ammunition and tear gas, were stationed around the memorial to defend it. Only about 300 people were allowed to pass through the area to lay wreaths at the memorial throughout the day. The families of revolutionary martyrs such as Griffith and Collins did not attend, even though they had received passes in advance. Former President Cosgrave, General O'Duffy, and other anti-government figures also did not appear. The current government has organized a wartime council, presided over by five senior military officers, specifically to deal with the issue of citizens privately possessing firearms. From this, it can be seen that the government is actively trying to prevent future disturbances.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, 14th - Although Valera has banned the Blue Shirts from marching in formation, General O'Duffy has begun recruiting new members on a large scale. O'Duffy has sent officers to major cities in the Free State to increase the momentum of the Blue Shirt movement. According to the National Guard headquarters in Dublin today, the Blue Shirts currently have 40,000 members and are expected to double in number within a week so that they can march in formation across Southern Ireland on the 20th of this month.</p>

<p>National, Berlin, 13th - According to recent reports, former German Chancellor Brüning will soon enter a monastery to live in seclusion and continue his scientific research. Brüning currently holds a seat in the Reichstag, but it is feared that he will resign from that position as well. Brüning is currently 48 years old and has studied history, philosophy, and political science. Before the European War, he obtained a doctorate in economics. From 1914 to 1918, he served in the Western Front as a machine gun squad leader. He was injured in the Battle of the Marne and, after recovering, engaged in labor relief work. In 1924, he was elected to the Reichstag. In 1930, President Hindenburg appointed him as Chancellor, which was the peak of Brüning's career. Last year, Brüning was overthrown by his political enemy, the current Chancellor Hitler, but Hitler unanimously praised Brüning's integrity and dedication to his duties. Furthermore, German newspapers have always referred to Brüning as the "Monk Chancellor." Now that it has become a reality, it is also a good story.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Due to the Feng Yuxiang incident, the Meng Salt Bureau in Koubei has been disrupted in its salt transport. It now plans to borrow and transport 100,000 dan of reed salt annually and has drafted ten measures. It has submitted these to the Salt Affairs Administration for forwarding to the Ministry of Finance for review. However, because the Longlu tax is heavier than that of the Koubei district, in order to prevent backflow and selling along the way, the Koubei Tax Collection Bureau will be ordered to collect surcharges based on the Qing salt tax rate of that district when merchants report their transport. The tax rate for that district will be compared to the highest tax rate within the Longlu area. The difference will be calculated and the merchants will be ordered to pay the corresponding amount at the Longlu branch office as a security deposit. Once the salt arrives at the shore, the bureau will jointly notify the Longlu branch office with the Tax Collection Bureau to refund the security deposit to the original merchant after verifying the quantity, in order to prevent malpractices.

From the 5th to the 8th or 9th, the river water suddenly dropped sharply, a troubling sign. Fortunately, Shandong Province has been actively managing the river works for years, and the dikes are considered solid, which brought some reassurance to the people. Unexpectedly, during this period, a warning was received that several breaches had been dug in the people's dikes in Changyuan County, Hebei Province, by bandits, and the water was tending to flood towards Shandong Province. Han Fuqu, the Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, regularly dispatched Zhang Lianjia, the Director of the River Affairs Bureau, to inspect the Linshengtun area upstream. Zhang set off after receiving the order. On the 10th, Zhang returned from his inspection, saying that the flood (the water discharged from Changyuan) was not large, and there were still more than ninety li from the northern bank of the dike in Puyang County, Shandong Province. All works in our province are extremely solid, and there is no cause for concern. Unexpectedly, the River Affairs Bureau today (12th) connected to the upstream general section chief Chen Wenmo's telegram from the two days, claiming that the No. 2 Fen Village of the first section on the southern bank of the Yellow River in Hebei Province broke at 12:00 noon that morning, and Dongming County in Hebei Province and Heze County in western Shandong Province will be the first to suffer. A special person was sent to Fen Village to check the water situation, and it was reported that the water crest in the river was more than one zhang high, and it was still seven or eight chi from the Shandong border. Wen Ri's telegram also said that he had inquired to Lin Danzhen, the head of the fourth section of Hebei Province, who said that the river water rose sharply by six or seven small chi at one o'clock in the afternoon, and the Stone Village Pass on the north bank (which was previously excavated by bandits in Changyuan County, in the north of the river) was being blocked. After this water discharge, work had been stopped. Above this pass, there were four other breaches, the largest of which was more than five li wide. The main stream was rushing and extremely turbulent, and the disaster in Changyuan Puyang and other counties in Hebei Province was extremely serious. At the same time, the Fen Village Pang Village area of the first duan on the south bank was also inundated into a mouth, overflowing outside the embankment. At first, it was only a few zhang wide, but later it became larger and larger. At this moment, it has reached more than fifty zhang, and the water is also fierce. The water head has passed Dongming County, and the Caozhu area in western Shandong Province will all become marshes. According to this, the River Affairs Bureau is preparing for prevention, and then received a telegram from Sun Zerang, the magistrate of Heze County, saying that the north bank of the Yellow River in Changyuan County had broken several more mouths on the You day, and the mouth was several miles wide. At the same time, the south bank also broke a mouth of more than thirty zhang. At 12:00 that night, the water head had passed Dongming, and this afternoon (12th), it can flow to Heze, etc.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the reasons for the Yellow River's breach this time and the subsequent flooding of Shandong Province are as follows: In the upstream area of Shaanzhou, there was continuous rain, and mountain floods broke out. The river water flowed downwards with the high and low water levels, like a galloping horse. The downstream river channel is narrow and has many bends. The riverbed is higher than the flat ground. The river water comes downstream and is restricted by the bends, so its force is fierce and powerful. In addition, the dikes along the river in the downstream provinces always consider the economic strength of each province and the experience of the river affairs personnel to determine the safety of one area, so the situation is different and the dike quality is different. Moreover, due to years of civil war and foreign aggression, the authorities have never had a unified plan, and even if there is a plan, it has not been implemented throughout the entire river. Only the provinces are governing themselves, mostly using the old method of ○blocking, treating the head when it hurts, and treating the feet when it hurts. This great disaster has been expected by most people for a long time. As for the reason for affecting Shandong Province, it is because Heze is adjacent to Dongming and Changyuan in Hebei, and Fan County, Yucheng, Shouzhang, Yanggu, Puyang, Dongping, and other counties in western Shandong are just within the people's embankment set of Hebei and Shandong provinces, so the Yellow River's breach in Changyuan, Hebei, first flooded the counties in western Shandong. Now the water crest has arrived in Heze, and soon the counties east of Heze will be a vast ocean and become a marsh.</p>
<p>According to a group of experts, this water crest flows to the Fen Shui Long Wu Temple in Dongping County. If it turns to the north, it will flow into the low-lying areas of Linqing and Wucheng, enter the North Canal, and still be discharged into the river channel, causing less harm. If it turns to the south, it will enter the South Canal, pass through the Nanyang and Weishan lakes, and flood directly into the Yangtze River, then the disaster area will expand, and the losses will be difficult to estimate. However, judging from the current trend of the water crest, it is mostly to the south. It is reported that the River Affairs Bureau believes that the Yellow River has already become a disaster, and in addition to reporting to the Provincial Government, it has also sent separate telegrams to the counties to strictly prevent and block it, so as to avoid general flooding. Today (12th), the Yellow River's water levels in Shandong Province vary, with some rising and some falling, and it has eased slightly. (12th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">The Lineup of the Southern Route Bandit Suppression Army <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>│Will Use Surprise Troops to Copy Bandit Rear Areas│</p>
<p>A dispatch from Shantou reports that after the Southern Route Army Headquarters moved to the Dayu Ridge, it immediately began a large-scale bandit suppression operation according to the original plan. The deployment of its forces is roughly as follows: In the Ganzhou area, there are the Li Zhenqiu, Ye Zhao, and Chen Zhangfu divisions of the First Column under Yu Hanmou, with a defense line from Ganzhou to Nanxiong and Xinfeng. From Nanxiong to Sannan, Lianping, Heping, and Longchuan, there are the Wang Zanbin, Zhang Meixin, and Li Hanhun divisions of the Third Column. This route is to protect the upper reaches of the northeastern rivers of Guangdong Province, and it was originally designated as the most important line of operations. From Anyuan, Xunwu, Xingning, Pingyuan, Jiaoling to Wuping and Shanghang, there are the Huang Renhuan, Huang Yanzhen, and Huang Zhiwen divisions of the Second Column. This line is a fortress to protect the border between Fujian, Guangdong, and Jiangxi. If we consider the bandits currently concentrated in Huichang Junmenling, this line can be called the front line in the confrontation. From Yongding, Longyan, Liancheng to Changting, there are the Qu Shounian, Shen Guanghan, and Zhang Yan divisions of the Fourth Column of the 19th Route Army. This line can be called the attacking line of the National Army, because Changting is very close to Ruijin, the Red Capital. If Changting is recovered, it can immediately attack the rear of the pseudo-Central District of Ruijin and Huichang, mutually responding to the defense line of Ganzhou. However, the bandits' tactics are to specialize in the deep mountains on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi, using the dangerous areas of mountains and rivers, attacking the bandit suppression army on one side and holding on to Junmenling on the other. Then, they send a large force into Qingliu and Yong'an in northern Fujian, attempting to disrupt the pre-determined formation of the bandit suppression army. Therefore, in the past half month, the front lines on both sides have changed repeatedly. However, the bandit suppression army has realized that the bandits are trying to invade Fujian, so it has also deployed surprise troops to copy the bandit rear areas. (August 8th)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Henan Defeated Soldiers Surrounded <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>=Henan and Anhui Troops Jointly Suppressing on a Large Scale=</p>
<p>=The Bandits in Huoqiu Are Again Trying to Stir Up Trouble=</p>
<p>A dispatch from Bengbu reports that the defeated soldiers who fled from Henan to Fuyang in northern Anhui Province have colluded with local bandits, causing Yingxian, across hundreds of li, to suffer successively. According to a telephone report from Zhengyangguan by the Changhuai Water Public Security Bureau on the 12th, there are about two or three thousand bandits, with more than one thousand guns, and a reported number of horses. One-third of the defeated soldiers and bandits are wearing military uniforms, while most are in civilian clothes. The flags are bright, resembling a motley army. The bandit flags are red with white borders, the symbols are red on top and white on the bottom, and there are thousands of men and women hostages. After this group of bandits fled to the southeastern township of Fuyang, they harassed the territory of Yingshang County. The county has been placed on strict alert to prevent them from approaching. The military authorities of Henan and Anhui provinces have paid extraordinary attention to this group of defeated soldiers and bandits and have deployed capable troops to jointly suppress them. It is now learned that Cheng Ziyi's troops, the Bandit Suppression Commander of the Henan Army, have arrived at Zhuzhai and, together with Ni Lingge's battalion of the Anhui Provincial Security Force, repelled the defeated soldiers and bandits on the afternoon of the 10th. The bandits fled to the Sixty Mile Store between Fuyang Yingshang and Nan Zhao in the middle. The first and second regiments of the Anhui Provincial Security Force also departed from Zhengyang on the 12th and headed to the front line. At present, the bandit suppression troops have been fully equipped and will take a large encirclement formation to jointly suppress them. Once they advance to a suitable location, they will order a general attack. The water police of the Changhuai Water Public Security Bureau stationed at the Second District Office in Zhengyang are now guarding the upper reaches of the Huaihe River, preventing the bandits from fleeing east by water. The Bureau also dispatched police officers on the 12th, carrying two machine guns, departing from Bengbu on the Huai Ren patrol boat and transporting them to Zhengyang for application to strengthen the water police force. Bureau Chief Jiang Yi sailed back to Zhengyang from Liuzikou on the Chang An warship on the 11th. On the 12th, he accompanied Wu Xijun, the Deputy Director of the Provincial Security Department, on a warship to Yingshang for inspection and to inspect the defense of the upper reaches of the Huaihe River. At a time when the defeated soldiers and bandits in Fuyang and Yingxian were causing trouble, the Red bandits in Huoqiu County were also rampant. Huoqiu is located south of Yingshang County and suffered greatly from the Red bandits last year. It was later recovered by government troops, but the remaining bandits were not completely eliminated. After Xu Tingyao's troops returned in triumph, the bandits stirred up trouble again. Recently, taking advantage of the rampant bandits in Fuyang, they gathered more than two thousand people, with more than one thousand guns, several mortars, and several machine guns, and fled north from Yejiaji, hoping to harass Zhengyang in conjunction with the forces of Zhang Xueliang and Yang Yaode. A few days ago, they were severely suppressed by the Cheng Yi regiment of the Independent 40th Division of Xu Zhongyue's troops stationed in the county in the Maocaodian and Chen Linzi areas west of the Shi River. More than a hundred bandits were killed and countless were injured. The Cheng Yi regiment took advantage of the victory to advance to Sanbuguan Fuginshan, and then defeated the Red bandits. The troops stationed in Huoqiu County City, believing that both the northern and southern bandits have not been eliminated, in addition to sending teams to block and suppress them, have also strictly prepared in the city.

<p>Xu Bingcheng, the Deputy Director of the Road Bureau, and engineers such as Shen Paiwen have come to Wuxi twice to investigate the issue of moving the Nanqi flag station in this county. Although some citizens of the Dayaoxiang area have expressed opposition, Xu and others believe that there will be many benefits after the relocation. However, there are two difficulties: ㈠ The transfer of vehicles, ㈡ Economic problems are not easy to resolve. Chen Yixin, the Standing Committee member of the No. 1 District and No. 3 Branch in this county, wrote to Xu, the Deputy Director of the Road Bureau, and others yesterday to elaborate on the advantages and disadvantages, and to answer the reasons for those who oppose the relocation one by one, and said that the opposition is not the true intention of the villagers, but malicious destruction. If it can be implemented resolutely and the difficulties are resolved, there will be a solution.</p>

<p>The Xicheng Long-Distance Bus Company recently obtained approval from the Construction Department to contract for the road maintenance project of the Xicheng Road, and the company, on behalf of the county, collects tolls from operating automobiles. The Construction Department ordered the magistrates of Xicheng to transfer the road maintenance project and the collection of tolls to the company. The operating small automobile companies were shocked to hear this, because the company has been oppressing the operating automobiles in the past, and now it intends to take this opportunity to control the road administration and monopolize the business, which is close to interfering with the powers of the official government. Therefore, they expressed unanimous opposition. Yesterday morning (14th), Cao Xuemei and others were elected as representatives and took the text to the county government to petition. Zhang Fulin, the director of the technology office, received them. After the representatives stated their opinions, Zhang, the director, said that the road surface in the south section (namely, the Xituan section) is more treacherous than the road surface in the north section (namely, the Chengtuan section). Even if it is necessary to repair the road surface in the north section, the south section cannot be generalized, so he agreed to submit the report to the Construction Department for verification. The representatives felt satisfied and left.</p>

<p>Chen Xiaomao, a resident of Daying, Shaoxing, was beaten to death a few days ago by Sun Azhou and Wu Ayu, two employees of Chen Wanxing's workshop. After reporting the incident, the court sent personnel to investigate. Because the fatal wound could not be found, the prosecutor, Zhao, accompanied by police officers, returned to the burial site on the 13th afternoon to re-examine the abdomen. The result showed that there was an injury in the small intestine, and the intestine was also red and swollen. It is presumed that it was caused by a kick before death. The two murderers in the case also surrendered to the county yesterday and have been taken into custody.</p>
<h3 id="e93">Special Report: Li Zhun's Naval Inspection Record <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the French navy's occupation of nine islands in Hainan has caused international disputes. Now, our country has historically and geographically proven that these nine islands are indeed our territory, that is, belonging to the Xisha Islands, and are subordinate to Qiongya. In April of the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty, Zhang Renjun, the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, fearing that the Japanese were plotting to occupy the Dongsha Islands, sent Li Zhisheng, the Guangdong Naval Admiral, to negotiate. Later, Mr. Li took the warships "Fubo" and "Chenhang" on a southern patrol, departing from Yulin Port in Yai. The next day, they arrived at Coral Island (Mr. Li renamed it Fubo Island). In total, they discovered 14 islands, which are the Xisha Islands. The islands that the French navy is forcibly occupying are also these. Mr. Li wrote a naval inspection record, detailing the journey, which is urgently reprinted here to prove that the Xisha Islands are indeed our territory.</p>
<p>After the Dongsha Island case was settled, I thought that there must be many islands in Guangdong like Dongsha. Lin Jun Guoxiang, the left-wing commander, who was experienced in navigation, said to me, "About two hundred nautical miles west of Yulin Port in Qiongzhou, there are islands, which Westerners call Paracel Islands (that is, PARACEL'S). About four hundred nautical miles from Hong Kong, anyone traveling east from Singapore to Hong Kong must pass this line. However, there are many reefs there, so ships often avoid it." I was eager to explore its details, include it in the nautical chart, and make it Chinese territory. Therefore, I requested Master An (that is, Zhang Renjun, the Governor-General of Guangdong and Guangxi, whose style name was Anpu) to explore this remote island. Master An readily agreed with my suggestion, and other enthusiasts among my colleagues also wanted to go and see it. Therefore, the task of naval exploration was assigned to Lin Jun Guoxiang, who took the warships "Fubo" and "Chenhang." Lin Jun said, "These two ships are too old and slow. If the weather is good, we can guarantee safety, but if we encounter strong winds, it will be very dangerous." I was eager to go, so I did not care about the risks. Therefore, I went on board with Lin Jun to examine the ship's boiler and machinery, repaired what needed to be repaired, and inspected all the masts, sails, and ropes. All the iron chains at the bottom of the cabin were pulled out onto the deck. Lin Jun tapped them with a hammer, and any chains that sounded damaged were marked with a white powder line to prevent them from breaking. Hundreds of dan of rice were prepared, as well as other livestock such as cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens, canned food, and soda water. Various types of rice, sorghum, wheat, and bean seeds were also prepared.</p>
<p>The freshwater tanks were filled with fresh water, and the coal bunkers were filled with bituminous coal. In addition to the crew, one hundred laborers, carpenters, stonemasons, caulkers, and painters were hired, as well as wood, masts, flags, etc. The intention was to find these islands and colonize them. I brought a platoon of guards, led by platoon leader Fan Lianzhong. Wu Jun Jingrong was the captain of "Fubo," and Liu Jun Yikuan was the captain of "Chenhang." I rode on "Fubo," with Lin Jun in charge of navigation, and I listened to his commands. Wang Jun Rentang accompanied us to consult. Those traveling with us were Li Zichuan, the Observer (Zhejuan); Wang Shuwu, the Prefect (Wen ○); Ding Shaosun, the Prefect (Naicheng); Pei Daiyun, the Prefect (Zuze); Wang Daoyuan, the Magistrate (Zongzhu); Shao Shuiqiao, the Circuit Intendant (Siyuan); Liu Ziyi, the Magistrate; Mr. Browns, the German wireless engineer; and Mr. Booth, the manager of the Lihe Foreign Firm. We set off on April 2nd of the 33rd year. On the 3rd, we arrived at the waters of Qiongzhou and purchased fish and vegetables to replenish fresh water. The local officials came to welcome us, and we spent a day and a night socializing. On the 4th afternoon, we set sail and traveled south along Qiongzhou Island. On the 5th, we entered Yulin Port in Yazhou. A gentle breeze was blowing. I was on the deck, observing. I saw that the mountains, water, and terrain of this port were excellent, and the water depth was 20 to 30 feet. The entrance was less than three li wide. After anchoring, we were surrounded by mountains, but there was no water outlet. It was truly a good harbor for sheltering from the wind. However, the area was too small to accommodate many warships. Seven or eight ships would be insufficient for maneuvering. The water in the port was calm, and the surface was clear and vast. I thought that we could sail directly to the Xisha Islands. Guoxiang said, "The weather cannot be relied upon. We must look at the astronomy. We need three to five days of southwest wind to set sail. We also need to replenish fresh water here." A short time later, we went ashore with the other officials, each carrying a wooden stick to lean on while walking and to defend against animals. This was Guoxiang's advice. I thought that it was possible to defend against beasts, but how could birds harm people? Guoxiang said, "There are many large crows on the Xisha Islands. They are not afraid of people and even fight with people. Without these sticks, we cannot defend against them." After going ashore, we walked along the plain into the mountains. All along the way, there were coconut trees everywhere, laden with fruit, some as large as an embrace and about one hundred feet tall. They were as straight as palms, and the leaves were large like banana leaves but split and not connected. At that time, the weather was hot, and the travelers were thirsty. They shot the coconut trees with guns, and the fruits fell one after another. People picked them up, and if they were pierced by bullets, the juice flowed out. They drank it with their mouths, and it was sweet and smooth, a holy product for quenching thirst. After walking about six or seven li, we found residents, with disheveled hair and bare feet, without clothes, using cloth to cover their lower bodies. They were as black as lacquer, with hair all over their chests, backs, elbows, and legs. Their ears were pierced with iron rings, as large as the mouth of a rice bowl. It was easy to distinguish the old from the young, but difficult to distinguish men from women. Their dwellings were made of coconut trees, less than ten feet high and about one or two zhang wide. The beams, doorposts, and pillars were all coconut trees. The roof and walls were all made of thick screens woven from coconut leaves in a herringbone pattern. There were doors but no windows. The floor inside was also covered with coconut mats, several inches thick. There were no tables, beds, or curtains. They ate, lived, and slept there. I took pictures of them with a hand mirror, and they all smiled happily. Then we went to a place where many men and women were dancing in the fields. Old and strong people were playing gongs, flutes, and percussion instruments on the side. There were mostly women dancing, and sometimes men joined them, all young people. Their teeth were white, and their mouths were spitting red foam. We learned that they were chewing betel nuts. If a man and woman dancing liked each other, they would hold hands and return home as husband and wife. Their language was indistinguishable. Guoxiang could understand one or two words, as they were raw Li people from the mountains. Soon, we found a familiar Li person who could speak Chinese to act as an interpreter. According to him, there were many deer in the mountains, as large as horses, which could be used for transportation, so they were called deer-horses. I was eager to hunt, but I had no hunting dogs. The familiar Li person said that Li people could be used instead. I immediately ordered this familiar Li person to find several people to lead the way and drive the deer-horses. The raw Li people held a stick and moved as fast as flying. They stepped over the wooden stakes in the mountains, which were as sharp as knives, as if walking on flat ground. I led many guards to follow behind, extremely exhausted. I sat by a stone to rest for a while and lit a cigarette. A herd of deer rushed out of the forest, as large as cattle and horses. I shot at them with a gun, hitting one, which fell to the ground and got up again. The guards caught it. Its horns were as large as bowls and about three feet long. I shot three or four more times. When it fell to the ground, it broke a horn, and blood dripped out. A guard sucked it with his mouth. Then five or six people carried it back to the ship with a large piece of wood, weighing it at four hundred jin after removing the skin. They divided the meat to eat, and the velvet was hung on the deck to be blown by the wind, thinking it could be preserved. After a few days, it was maggot-infested and rotten, and the stench was unbearable, so it was discarded into the sea. One day after the rain, I was sitting on the deck in a high place, enjoying the cool. Suddenly, I saw a black object coming towards my ship from the sea, raising its head above the water. Its mouth was sharp and long. I asked, "What is this?" Guoxiang said, "This is a sea eel. Han Wengong (Han Yu) wrote an essay to drive them away in Chaozhou. This is the one." As he spoke, the sea eel reached the side of the ship and climbed up the rope ladder. I ordered the guards at the ladder to strike it with a gun, but the guards retreated several steps, not daring to strike. I quickly went down, seized a gun, and struck it. The sea eel fell, its white belly facing the sky, about forty or fifty feet from the ship. I immediately ordered the sailors to launch a sampan to catch it. The sailors used a pole to pick it up, but it was about ten feet long and too heavy to lift. Fearing that it was not dead, they did not dare to touch it. They fired two more shots, and it sank to the bottom of the water and disappeared. For several days, the weather was not good. A halo appeared around the moon, indicating that a strong wind was coming. Guoxiang bought countless firewood here, piled on the deck like a mountain, to be used when coal was lacking. He also bought hundreds of coconut mats from the Li people to build walls, roofs, and floors. On the fourth day, we gathered with our colleagues to visit the salt fields in Sanliao Port, about twenty li from here. We used rattan chairs strung with bamboo poles to walk, and hired Li people to carry us, agreeing to pay each person two mao of silver. The Li people were very strong and walked very fast, but they were not good at carrying, so the journey was very dangerous. In a short time, we arrived at the place. The salt fields were between two mountains, stretching for more than ten li, all salt fields. The water was extremely salty, and salt could be formed in one day. Some took two or three days, but it was not as common as in other salt fields. The price was extremely cheap, only two or three hundred coins per stone. Therefore, the smuggled salt in Hong Kong and Macau was all transported from here. In the forests along the way, there were many red and green parrots, of different sizes. The white ones were larger and fewer. There were also many small monkeys flying around, impossible to catch. After returning to Yulin Port, the Li people who carried the sedan chairs were given two mao of silver each, but they refused to accept it, because they wanted more. We increased it to four mao, but they still refused. After asking, we learned that they thought the price was two mao for each sedan chair shared by two people. Now that they were given two mao more, they refused to accept it. They were so simple and unsophisticated, truly like the people of ancient times. A Li person carried a large python on a bamboo pole to sell, and we gave him two yuan of silver and told him to take it away. They also carried several jars of rice wine, giving them one yuan of silver for each jar. The color was black and the taste was sweet. There were also Hui people from here, speaking a northern dialect, selling stone crabs and flying snakes. Few of the stone crabs were intact. Preserved in vinegar, they could treat sores. Flying snakes could induce labor. People competed to buy them. There was also a kind of coconut bead, like a fish eye, said to be formed inside a coconut shell after hundreds of years. Daiyun bought it. The Hui people said that they were left behind by Ma Fubo during his campaign against Jiaozhi. There were not many people left today, but they still spoke a northern dialect, different from the Cantonese. Guoxiang said that the weather was good and we could set sail. On April 11th, at four o'clock in the afternoon, we lifted anchor and left the port. The wind was calm and the waves were gentle. At seven o'clock, we suddenly saw something like an island in front of us, faintly visible. Guoxiang said, "There are no mountains here. It must be a whale. We should detour to avoid it." I looked at it with a telescope and saw a black shadow stretching across the water, not very high. My colleagues were eager to see it. Soon, it gradually sank. The ship continued to sail straight according to the longitude and latitude. Guoxiang and Jingrong stayed up all night, working on the deck, directing the helmsman. There was also a person on the top of the mast, observing with a telescope. They did not dare to relax at all. Guoxiang said, "According to the ship's speed and the sea conditions, we should be able to see the nearest island by now. If we don't see it, there must be an error in the astronomical measurement. Advancing one degree is very dangerous. This is because the ship's horsepower is insufficient and we have been pushed down by the current. We should be careful. There are many reefs here. If we are not careful, the whole ship will be smashed to pieces." A moment later, the person on the mast reported that he saw a black shadow, but it was upstream. Guoxiang and Jingrong carefully oriented themselves and steered straight towards the shadowy island. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e94">Unemployed Overseas Chinese Return to Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>Government Allocates Funds to Transport in Batches</p>
<p>First Batch of One Hundred and Twenty-Three People</p>
<p>Distressed Return Home Recounting Past Hardships</p>
<p>(Shen Shi News Agency, Local Report) Hundreds of overseas Chinese in Japan, unable to withstand the oppression of that country, have become unemployed one after another. The Executive Yuan ordered the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to work with the local consulate to shelter the unemployed overseas Chinese forced to leave Japan and send them back to their home country in batches. The first batch of one hundred and twenty-three men, women, and children arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning at six o'clock aboard the Changxing Company's "Asia Queen" ship. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e95">Reasons for Repatriation <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Our country's overseas Chinese merchants are being squeezed and hated by the Japanese, and the number of unemployed is increasing day by day. Because they have no money to return home, they are displaced and suffer unspeakable pain. Later, the government initiated a plan in the spring of the 21st year of the Republic to transport unemployed overseas Chinese forced to leave Kobe and Yokohama back to their home country. However, Nagasaki had a larger population and various difficulties, so they were not immediately transported back. Recently, the Nagasaki branch of the Chinese Nationalist Party, seeing that a large number of unemployed overseas Chinese were stranded in a foreign country, with their livelihoods on the verge of collapse, and the Japanese oppression was severe, felt that if they were not quickly transported back, the future would be unthinkable. Therefore, they telegraphed the Central Overseas Party Committee to report everything. The Central Overseas Party Committee then wrote to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, which was approved by the Executive Yuan. The Ministry of Finance allocated more than six thousand yuan to begin transporting more than four hundred unemployed overseas Chinese in that area back to their home country in batches, to be sent back to their original homes separately.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Overseas Chinese Association Sends Personnel to Assist <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the order from the Executive Yuan, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission originally intended to send personnel to Japan to handle all assistance matters. However, due to economic reasons, they had to entrust the Changxing Shipping Company and the Chinese Consulate in Nagasaki to handle the matter. The Commission recently received a reply from the Nagasaki Consulate stating, "To the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Regarding the return of 123 overseas Chinese this time, 109 are going to Fujian, and Yang Hechai and Zheng Xingbang are designated as assistants. Eleven are going to Shandong, and three are going to Shanghai. Wu Zhenting is designated as the assistant. We hereby request that you provide assistance. Zhang Chi, Consul in Nagasaki, August 22nd." After receiving the telegram, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission immediately appointed Zhou Yanming, Director of the Administration Office, Zhao Xuanyang, and Tan Zhonglu to come to Shanghai from Nanjing to prepare all registration, assistance, and repatriation matters.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Situation of Overseas Chinese Arriving in Port <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>This first batch of returning overseas Chinese consists of 123 people, including 56 workers, 15 women and children, and 52 children. They arrived in Shanghai aboard the British-owned Changxing Company's "Asia Queen" ship. The ship entered the port at four o'clock yesterday morning and arrived at the Pudong Wharf at about six o'clock. At about nine o'clock, a small boat transported all the overseas Chinese to the Xinguang Wharf to disembark. Because of the large number of people and their disheveled appearance and mismatched clothing, the overseas Chinese were once interfered with by Western police officers. After the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission sent personnel to explain the situation, they were allowed to pass. After leaving Xinguang, the overseas Chinese took four pre-hired large trucks to the Asia Hotel on Avenue Edward VII, where dozens of rooms were arranged for them to stay. Meals were immediately provided. Because the returning overseas Chinese were all returning with their families, their luggage was extremely cumbersome. It was not until about eleven o'clock that the unloading was completed. The Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will conduct a detailed registration of the returning overseas Chinese, including their place of origin, age, occupation in Japan, family situation, and personal skills. Particular attention will be paid to the skills, so that there is a basis for future relief.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Repatriation to Original Homes Separately <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>They will stay at the Asia Hotel tonight, and starting today, they will be sent back to their original homes in batches as quickly as possible. Most of the returning overseas Chinese this time are from Fujian, and a small number are from Shandong. Once there are ships going to Fujian, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission will purchase tickets for them and send them off. Those going to Shandong will return home by train, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission has written to the Ministry of Railways to allow them to travel for free or at a reduced fare.</p>

<h3 id="e100">Recounting Forced Experiences <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Shen Shi News Agency visited the Asia Hotel to learn the truth about the hardships faced by overseas Chinese in Japan. However, most of the overseas Chinese had been in Japan for many years and could no longer speak their native language. Finally, they found a porcelain repair worker from Fujian who could speak freely. Here is a record of his words: "I am a porcelain worker and have been in Japan for seven or eight years. At first, it was okay there, but in recent years, the Japanese have treated us very badly. They either abuse us or want to deport us back to our home country. For example, when the Japanese buy things from overseas Chinese, they often give us at most five mao for something that is clearly worth one yuan. If you reason with them, they will beat you, and we cannot fight back. Even if we go to the police station, the judgment will always be against us. When we go to the Chinese Consulate to ask for help, the consul also tells us that there is really nothing they can do. Also, in the countryside of Nagasaki, the Japanese often ambush us for no reason. Chinese people in Nagasaki opened a Huile Yuan restaurant. One day, some Japanese came and not only refused to pay for their food and drinks, but also started arguing. They all pulled out knives and stabbed them on the table, saying, "You Chinese killed our Japanese in Shanghai, so we must kill you Chinese in Japan." If it weren't for the fact that the wife of one of the waiters was Japanese, the whole family would have been completely harmed. There are many, many things like this. In short, the oppression we suffered in Japan was really too deep. We can't do business and we'll starve to death if we stay in a foreign country. So we have to return to our home country. We are very happy to be back in our home country, but I heard that Japanese people often kill Chinese people in China. I don't know if it's true. We are very grateful to the government for rescuing us, but we hope the government will also find a fundamental solution for us, because we are unemployed. There's still no solution when we return to our old home..."</p>
<h3 id="e101">Second Batch Coming Soon <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Most of the overseas Chinese returning this time are workers and small business people, especially cloth merchants. Because they are scattered in the four villages of Nagasaki, it took time for the consul to gather them, so they can only come to Shanghai in batches. The rest who have not yet returned are still being notified by the consulate in Nagasaki to gather at the consulate, so that they can continue to be transported back to their home country. According to officials from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, the second batch of overseas Chinese will arrive in Shanghai on the next Changxing Company ship, with about 200 people.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Song Ziwen's Return Date <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Departing from Seattle on the 12th</p>
<p>Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on the 29th</p>
<p>Song Ziwen, Vice President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance, was ordered to go abroad to participate in the Washington World Economic Conference and the London World Economic Conference, and toured European countries, making many observations. Mr. Song originally planned to return to China from Geneva on the Italian mail ship "Conte Rosso", but because of a trip to the United States to meet with President Roosevelt, he changed his plans to return home on the 12th on the Dollar Line's "President Jefferson" ship, departing from Seattle. According to the itinerary, he is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 29th. At that time, the central government and various sectors will send personnel to the pier to offer a grand welcome.</p>

<p>Chen Zongdai Leads Troops to Resist Japan and Recovers Several Counties</p>
<p>Ding Chao Captured by the Japanese and Killed in Changchun</p>
<p>The Northeast News Agency reports that after General Li Du, Commander-in-Chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, withdrew to Russia, Chen Zongdai took over command of his troops and continued to resist Japan. Su Anren, propaganda team leader of Li's army, was summoned by telegram from General Li and entered the country via Mishan. He arrived in Shanghai yesterday. A reporter from the Northeast News Agency interviewed Su at his lodging. He spoke in detail about the activities of the Northeast Volunteer Army and the inside story of the puppet state. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e115">Chen Takes Over Command of Li's Army <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>After General Li Du withdrew to Russia last winter, Chen Zongdai took over as acting commander-in-chief. He led soldiers in the Erdaodaohezi area south of Yilan and continued to resist Japan. He repeatedly engaged in fierce battles with the enemy and stubbornly defended Boli County and Jiamusi. Due to lack of ammunition and reinforcements, he withdrew to Mishan. He contacted Zhang Baohe, Shan Guiting, Gao Baoshan, and other units to besiege Mishan. After more than ten days of hard fighting, he withdrew to the Muling River line due to weakness. Chen was stationed in Hulin, planning a counterattack. He sent personnel to the Russian territory and obtained spiritual assistance from the Russians and sympathy from the Korean Independence Corps. In June of this year, he occupied Heizuizi and Baipaozi. The puppet army Guo brigade in Mishan had the intention of rebelling. The puppet army Tao brigade was defeated in the Battle of Heizuizi. The fact that several counties have not been lost is due to Chen's determination to resist Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Gao's Troops Contact and Attack <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Gao Yushan of the Jilin National Salvation Army Wang Delin's army was originally a commander of the Gouli Brigade. After General Li left the country, Gao's army was authorized to use good firearms. Gao's army killed three Japanese consuls and two translators stationed in Hulin in three days. Russians in Jiangdong congratulated Gao County Jin Baiqi, saying that the hearts of the Chinese people had not died. Gao also led 3,000 troops to attack Mishan, contacted Chen's army, and resolved the Raohe puppet army. Thousands of civilians in the county also helped Gao resist Japan. Chen and Gao's two armies totaled 30,000 troops. Zou's army was stationed in Hulin, with rear defenses in Raohe and Funing, with more than ten artillery pieces, more than twenty machine guns, and a source of ammunition, and could operate victoriously.</p>

<p>In Yilan, Jiamusi, and Nandai Diaoling, there are Zhang Zhichao's Wuwei Team and the Self-Defense Army Li Huatang, totaling more than 10,000 people, with great momentum. Zhang Xihou, commander of the rear of the Self-Defense Army in Jiangbei, together with Sui County Magistrate Chen Dafan, Liu Bin's subordinate Xu Xun, Wuwei Commander Ru Youcai, and Yuan Fushan and Zang Jingzhi, engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese Iizuka Regiment and Obina Detachment in Suidong in March. The Japanese army suffered heavy casualties and are still active in the Suidong area. There are also tens of thousands of volunteer soldiers in Yitong, Shuangyang, Panshi, and Dunhua, led by Mao Zuobin, who have repeatedly frustrated the enemy's advance. Deng Tiemei's troops, who have resisted Japan most vigorously in Liaodong, are now actively disrupting various counties in Liaohai and destroying the South Manchuria Railway.</p>

<p>General Ding Chao, Chairman of the Jilin Provincial Government, retreated to Hezhoubang last winter after Binqing was lost due to his inability to resist. He hoped to withdraw to Russia, but the rear road was cut off by the Japanese army, making it difficult to advance or retreat. He was surrounded by the Iizuka troops of the Japanese army and became a prisoner. More than half of the soldiers surrendered their weapons, while the rest joined the Volunteer Army. General Ding, along with his staff members Tong Heng and Zhang Letian, was escorted by the Japanese to Harbin. After being interrogated by Lieutenant General Hiromura of the Hirose Division, he was escorted to the puppet capital Changchun. In April of this year, he was assassinated by the Japanese in Changchun Park. His staff members were also killed. Alas, how tragic!</p>

<p>The violent Japanese adopted the old strategy of annexing Korea, seizing political, economic, and educational power in the puppet Manchurian state. The main personnel in each department are Japanese. The so-called Emperor Puyi is just a puppet. Regarding the economy of Manchuria, the Japanese indiscriminately issued puppet Central Bank banknotes and issued propaganda to encourage their use. In the puppet state's education, Japanese language is added to all major and minor schools, and the youth are anesthetized with the fallacy of coexistence and co-prosperity. Their methods are known to be vicious.</p>

<p>In the past, the puppet army has now been reorganized and disbanded by the Japanese army. Divisions are reorganized into brigades, and brigades are reorganized into regiments. The ranks remain the same, but the power shifts. A Major General brigade commander only commands two battalions, and a Colonel regiment commander only commands four small companies. The Japanese army is stationed in fortresses, and the puppet army is stationed outside various cities. Ammunition is not issued because the Japanese still have concerns. Each brigade and regiment of the puppet army also hires Japanese chiefs of staff, instructors, and advisors to monitor the actions of the puppet army. The numbers of the puppet army are listed below. In the Yilan Road area, Yu Nicheng and others have a total of 1,500 men. In the Binjiang Road area, Li Niwenbing has 2,500 men. In the Jichang Road area, Xing Nilian has 1,500 men. In the Yanji Road area, there is an independent regiment with 2,000 men. Zhang Nihaipeng has 5,000 men, and Yu Nizhishan has 3,000 men. The military strength cannot be concentrated, and the ammunition is insufficient. Without the cover of the Japanese army, they are not worth a single blow. Recently, those who fill the ranks of lower-level officers and soldiers in the puppet army are all driven by livelihood and have long had the determination to defect and support the advance of the Volunteer Army, which can be shown during combat. They cannot bear to kill each other. The soldiers all have a concept of their homeland. Whenever puppet officials give speeches with words of friendship with Japan, the soldiers scold them endlessly. Therefore, there are many who surrender.</p>

<p>The puppet ships on the Songhua River, except for those forcibly seized by the Japanese army for military use, only have a few small merchant ships left. Whenever military or commercial transport passes through Tongjiang on the Ussuri River, they must raise the Qing Tian Bai Ri flag to pass. If they fly the puppet flag, the Russian side will stop them or detain them. The detention of the Tongshan ship was due to this reason. Recently, the areas bordering Russia on the Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers are neutral zones. The Japanese army cannot invade without authorization, and the Volunteer Army can take advantage of this opportunity to operate.</p>

<p>The puppet government recently sent "pacification" officials to inspect various places, protected by the Japanese army. They also sent Korean secret agents to investigate the families of our Volunteer Army. Those who are discovered are immediately subjected to extreme torture.

They gather together and rise up to resist, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Zhu Jiqing Talks About the Course of the Volunteer Army's Resistance Against Japan <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>This Trip South is to Publicize the Accounts of Donations</p>
<p>Whether to Recover Lost Territory Depends on the Will of the People</p>
<p>Zhu Jiqing, Commander-in-Chief of the Northeast People's Salvation Army, went north to resist Japan last spring and made outstanding achievements in the Liaoxi-Rehe border area. After Tang Yulin abandoned Rehe and surrendered to the puppet Manchuria, Zhu led his troops to retreat to Xiaojiadian and continued to command the volunteer armies in Liaoxi-Rehe, lying in wait in various places on the Liaoxi-Rehe border, waiting for an opportunity to resist Japan. Recently, he decided to publicize the detailed accounts of the donations received from the people so that all sectors could understand the truth. He specially went south a few days ago. When he passed through Beijing, he met with President Wang and the central authorities to request instructions on future plans. Now that the publicity is complete, he arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning to prepare to publicize the various accounts. A reporter from this newspaper specially visited Zhu's private residence last night to inquire about the course of the Volunteer Army's resistance against Japan and its current situation. According to him, he went to the Liaoxi-Rehe border area in January of last year to engage in anti-Japanese work. The volunteer armies in Liaoxi and Rehe are directly under the command of the Northeast National Salvation Army Headquarters, so there are many of them. The first attack on Yixian last spring was undertaken by the troops of Ma Zidan and Li Haifeng. They fought the Japanese puppets and retreated after one day, with no major losses on either side. The second attack on Yixian Jinzhou was undertaken by the troops of Bao Enfu, Ma Zidan, Liu Chunqi, Mi Ziheng, Wang Yuanping, Meng Xiyao, Shi Linge, Li Peizhi, Zhang Zisheng, and Zhan Tao, totaling tens of thousands of people who engaged in fierce battles with the enemy for one and a half days. In the end, they retreated due to lack of ammunition. The third attack on Jinzhou was undertaken by the troops of Song Jiuling, Li Shijun, He Xiangchen, Gu Degui, and others. They fought hard for two days and two nights, but the result was unsuccessful and they retreated. Although our army failed to achieve its goals due to various reasons in the second and third attacks, the damage to the Japanese puppet army was not insignificant. When Tang Yulin abandoned Rehe without a fight, Zhu immediately led a small number of troops to retreat to Xiaojiadian, while the remaining volunteer armies still lay dormant in their original locations to facilitate resistance at any time. Most of the volunteer armies under his command were bandits, followed by the civilian regiments. Among the bandit teams, Gao Pengzhen was the most famous, with more than 5,600 men and more than 5,300 guns. He made outstanding contributions in the battle to attack Xinmin. Zhu returned to Beijing once in July of last year and then went back to work outside the pass. He did not leave Xiaojiadian to go south until June of this year. After Zhu went south, he received reports that the Japanese puppet army in Yixian began to attack the volunteer army on July 6. The volunteer army rose up to resist and fought fiercely until July 18. Both sides suffered heavy casualties. Since the 18th, the fighting has stopped. The reporter asked how many volunteer soldiers there were in Liaoxi. Zhu replied that there were hundreds of thousands of people, and the guns were all ready, but they were all fighting independently, so they failed to achieve great results. The reporter asked, then is there a way to reorganize them? Zhu replied that the way to reorganize them is to gather the leaders of the various troops in one place and then reorganize them. However, the cost is huge, and it is quite difficult to limit resources. The reporter asked about the current situation of the volunteer army in Liaodong. Zhu replied that there were still many volunteer armies in Liaodong, such as the troops left behind by Wang Delin, with more than 20,000 people. In addition, there are many local militias everywhere, currently commanded by Deng Tiemei and Tang Juguwu, and they have all been launched one after another. Local newspapers have also reported on them, but their strength is still limited. Whether the lost territory can be recovered depends on the government's policies and the will of the people. Zhu came south specifically to publicize the accounts of donations received, and he is now scheduled to send them to the newspapers tonight (last night) so that all sectors can browse them tomorrow morning. Shanghai is very hot and he is not used to living there. The northern affairs are heavy and need to be dealt with urgently, so he will return north within a few days. The matters that should be contacted with the central government have been completed in Nanjing, so there is no need to go to Lushan again, and so on.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Maigen Road Dispute Heard Yesterday <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Central People's Movement Committee and the Ministry of Railways Send Personnel to Persuade</p>
<p>Foreman Declares Abandonment of Election and Being Elected Rights</p>
<p>After the loading and unloading workers at Maigen Road Freight Station refused to register because the authorities deprived the four foremen of their right to be elected, the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee and the Ministry of Railways specially sent personnel to Shanghai to try to persuade them. The old foremen Shen Yuqing and others published a letter to the workers, declaring that they would abandon their right to elect and be elected. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e127">Send Personnel to Persuade <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>All the loading and unloading workers at Maigen Station were working as usual yesterday morning, refusing to register, and the order was quite good. Li Renzhu, a member of the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee, and Guo Zhongxing and Yang Ge, commissioners of the Ministry of Railways, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday to guide the establishment of the Maigen Road loading and unloading workers' office. Now, because the workers refused to register, they took on the task of persuasion and stated that 1. The election problem will be reported to the central government for instructions; 2. The temporary rules for the loading and unloading workers' office can be accepted in principle; 3. All loading and unloading workers must first register and wait for a solution.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Attitudes of Both Sides <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>According to the person in charge of the Two Roads Administration, the loading and unloading workers at Maigen Station refused to register this time due to a misunderstanding. The bureau's handling of the registration of the station and the restriction of the election rights of the four general foremen are all in accordance with the orders of the central government. Representatives of the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee and the Ministry of Railways have explained this to the workers, and this matter will be resolved soon. According to the loading and unloading workers, the former general foremen of the cooperative, Shen Yuqing and others, are extremely fair in their work and can be called models for the workers. Now that the railway bureau has exploited their right to elect and be elected, although the four general foremen have made sacrifices for the public and announced that they have abandoned their inherent rights, the workers cannot bear to sit idly by and watch them sacrifice, so they decided to fight for the restoration of their right to elect. As for the central government's order to reorganize the cooperative into an office, the temporary rules really need to be revised, and so on.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Abandon the Election <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The former general foremen of the cooperative, Shen Yuqing and others, in order to absolutely obey the central government's and the Ministry of Railways' resolution methods, wrote a letter to all the loading and unloading workers at Maigen Station, stating: "The loading and unloading workers at the Maigen Road Station of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway previously caused a major dispute due to the railway bureau sending Yang Minzhen to contract the work and canceling the original cooperative. Thanks to the support and supervision of the superior leaders and various groups, we were fortunate not to fail. In addition to being deeply grateful for the kindness of all parties, Yongxing and others are also very fortunate. However, after investigation by the Central Party Department and the Ministry of Railways, this case cannot be directly resolved by our cooperative and the railway bureau, so we should wait for processing. During this process, Yongxing and others only knew to supervise the workers to strictly abide by discipline and work hard, waiting for the superior to clearly judge right and wrong and protect the workers' livelihoods. This heart and this aspiration can be sworn to heaven and earth. Now, fortunately, the Central Party Department and the Ministry of Railways have discussed a solution and sent personnel to Shanghai to seek a solution. The solution is roughly divided into four points: 1. The contractor sent by the railway bureau will be resolutely cancelled; 2. The old cooperative should be reorganized into an office; 3. The office will elect two other general foremen to preside over everything; 4. The original four foremen must not be elected as foremen after the reorganization. We believe that this method is the best. Yongxing and others are very grateful to hear the news. Only this time, unfortunately, Shuixing and others have to fight for the 769 people's livelihoods with the railway bureau. Now, fortunately, the central government and the Ministry of Railways have a solution, which can still preserve the livelihoods and interests of all workers. We are very happy. We have heard that the workers and comrades still cannot let go of the fact that Yongxing and others were innocently deprived of their right to be elected and the question of the departure and retention of Yongxing and others. This is what Yongxing and others think is impossible. Although the comrades are acting out of the sincerity of loving us, we must know that loving us will hinder the path to resolving the dispute. Those who are not virtuous may even use the fact that Yongxing and others are clinging to power and deliberately instigating, so the comrades' love for us is enough to harm us. Moreover, Yongxing and others are already exhausted in this case. We originally hoped for an early and satisfactory solution to unload our burdens and to slightly reduce the suspicions of the railway bureau. This would be beneficial to both the public and the private. Yongxing and others only seek to benefit all workers, and we do not care about any personal sacrifice. Therefore, we hope that all comrades will still follow the orders in good faith, resolve the matter as soon as possible, and realize the reorganization so that all workers can work with peace of mind. We hereby declare our original intentions to dispel future misunderstandings. Yongxing and others have decided to give up their right to elect and be elected when the general foremen are re-elected in order to elect other capable people to seek permanent happiness for all workers. Please do not cling to your own opinions and have disputes, and do not re-elect the old four people to aggravate the guilt of Yongxing and others. We will be very grateful. We hereby declare, Shen Yuqing, Zheng Yongxing, Zhang Yuchang, Song Kaigui, together."</p>

<p>Yesterday Went to Wusong Waters for Gun Testing</p>
<p>The Commander of the British Navy Fleet in China, after approval by the British Admiralty, ordered the construction of a new type of shallow-water warship, named the HMS Sandpiper, which was assembled by the Jiangnan Shipyard. It is scheduled to be handed over to the British Admiralty's representative for acceptance on the 20th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Construction Process <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The design of the ship is the latest type of 1933 drawn by the British Admiralty. The various parts of the hull were assembled in England in hundreds of boxes and shipped to Shanghai in April. The Jiangnan Shipyard was entrusted to assemble them. The British Admiralty sent Lieutenant Colonel Zobt and Lieutenant Colonel Reed to Shanghai to supervise the construction. The shipyard also assigned Mr. Zheng Zhaoling, a quality inspector with shipbuilding experience, as the construction supervisor. After the start of construction, a launching ceremony was held in June. Mrs. Mao Gen, the chief engineer of the shipyard, broke the bottle. It has now been completed.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Gun Testing Yesterday <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>After the completion of the various parts of the project, in addition to going to Longhua four times to test the engine, it sailed to the waters outside the Wusongkou for the first gun test at 6:00 AM yesterday morning. A total of 28 shells were fired from the front and rear guns. The firing force was very sufficient, with each shell reaching a range of 10 miles, about 30 Chinese miles. It did not return to Shanghai until about 5:00 PM. In addition, the engine test results showed a speed of more than 12 knots per hour.</p>
<h3 id="e133">Assignment of Captain <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>After the completion of the ship, the full list of officers for the entire vessel, as learned by the Huadong News Agency reporter, includes Commander Ash, Lieutenant Commander Gullot, Inspectors Mr. Reed and Lieutenant Colonels Hclt, Chief Engineer Guelon, and Second Engineer Cor, all of whom are British naval officers stationed in China and familiar with the situation in China.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Overall Ship Structure <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The total tonnage of the ship is 167 tons, with 30 tons for the machinery and 115 tons for the hull. It is 210 feet long, 30 feet wide, and has a draft of 2 feet. Its speed is 12 nautical miles per hour. It has two cannons, both of which are the latest models from 1933. The front cannon is named the Six-Pound Cannon, and the rear cannon is named the 3.7-inch Cannon. The bottom is black, and the hull is light gray.</p>

<p>According to Mr. Zheng Zhangling, the ship's inspector, speaking to the Huadong News Agency reporter, the ship began construction on April 3rd and is now complete. The engineering aspect was exceptionally rapid. The British side was quite cautious about this project, and in addition to sending me to supervise, they also sent engineer Wang Rong, electrician Gong Zhenfeng, and construction worker Sun Jingyang to work together. The British side highly praised this rapid project. It has now been decided to transfer the ship to British naval personnel stationed in Shanghai on the 20th of this month for acceptance. Furthermore, it is determined that the ship will raise its flag and join the fleet on September 1st.</p>

<p>Expresses regret for irresponsible statements</p>
<p>Lanzhou-Qinghai Branch Line to Have Trial Flight at the End of the Month</p>
<p>The New Voice News Agency reports that Mr. Li Jingcong, General Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, issued a statement denying rumors from Beijing that the Eurasia Aviation Corporation was originally scheduled to begin joint flights with Europe on August 1st, but due to insufficient preparation, it was changed to September 1st. Mr. Li said that Beijing has repeatedly published such irresponsible statements recently, which have affected the company's international credibility. Eurasia Aviation Corporation is an international business organization, and international partners attach great importance to it. The company will never lightly announce the date of operation until it is completely determined, so as not to affect its long-standing reputation. Now, Beijing has made such irresponsible statements, which the company deeply regrets. In addition, Beijing also reported that the Executive Yuan ordered the company to carefully handle the route through the Soviet Union to Germany, which is also not true. The company has never received any instructions from the Executive Yuan regarding this matter, and the company has always been cautious in its work, so such instructions seem unnecessary. Rumors of this kind hinder the company's future development. In fact, the company is actively working to implement joint flights with Eurasia, but the exact date has not yet been determined. However, it is hoped that it can be realized soon. As for the Lanzhou-Qinghai branch line, it will depart for a trial flight at the end of this month, but the exact date has not yet been determined.</p>
<p>Reply from the Tax Bureau to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<h3 id="e140">On the Expression of Fixed-Amount Tax on Local Wine <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>New taxes should be assessed and collected in accordance with regulations</p>
<p>Strikes and cessation of brewing are inappropriate</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received letters from local yellow wine guilds, stating that after the promulgation of the fixed-amount tax, the printing certificates were canceled, and the industry was on the verge of extinction. The general meeting of all members resolved to strike and cease transportation and requested to forward the matter to the Tax Bureau for revision. The Tax Bureau immediately sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance's Taxation Department. The reply from the department, which is transcribed below, is sent directly: Letter No. 482 from your council has been received. The special printing certificate is an evil practice left over from the Beijing lower government era. This revision of the tax system eliminates long-standing abuses and unifies collection. There is no reason to retain the printing certificate. The fixed-amount tax on local goods should be assessed and collected in accordance with regulations. The collecting agency cannot make extra demands, and merchants must not seek to pay less. The guild directly presented a petition earlier, which was refuted in detail by the ministry. The refutation is copied and sent for reference. As for the guild's original letter stating that the new tax hinders business, how it hinders business is not stated, and there is no way to verify it. In short, for the sake of reorganizing tax revenue, the new regulations are imperative. Regarding the difficulties that merchants believe exist in the procedures, all those that do not violate principles have been ordered by the department to be changed as appropriate to understand the merchants' situation. The guild should not insist on its own opinions, regardless of the right and wrong of the matter, and use the cessation of transportation and brewing as unreasonable demands to disrupt the reorganization of the tax system, which is inappropriate. As for freedom of business, it should not be interfered with by others. The guild even declared in a circular to all workers in the workshops to stop working and sent many people to monitor the sections. If this is implemented, it is close to hindering the same industry and obstructing tax administration. It should be known that this kind of action has exceeded the scope stipulated by the Public Association Law and should be corrected immediately. If the guild continues to make trouble unreasonably, the department will only handle it in accordance with the law and will not be lenient. Your council leads the merchants and understands the general situation. Please inform all the merchants accordingly.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Pacific Passenger Ticket Association Reduces First-Class Fares Between Shanghai and Hong Kong <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>The Da Mei Evening News reports that the Pacific Passenger Ticket Association has decided to reduce first-class fares between Shanghai and Hong Kong. One-way fares will be reduced from 150 yuan to 130 yuan, and round-trip fares will be reduced from 270 yuan to 234 yuan. It is heard that the reason for the price reduction is that the fares set by various companies in the Suez Passenger Ticket Association are based on the pound sterling and enjoy exchange rate benefits, so they have also reduced prices to compete. Changxing, Dalai, and American Postal and Japanese Postal companies are all affiliated with the association.</p>

<h3 id="e144">Shaanxi Disaster Relief Association Cables for Emergency Relief to More Than 40 County Disaster Victims <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Temporary Charity Relief Association for Disaster Areas in Henan, Anhui, and Hubei received a cable from the Shaanxi Disaster Relief United Association requesting relief for disaster victims in more than 40 counties and allocating large sums of money for emergency relief. The original cable is as follows: Greetings to the Henan, Anhui, Hubei, and Jiangxi Relief Association. Shaanxi has suffered from disasters for five years, which is rarely heard of at home and abroad. This year's black frost and giant hail have also passed through the entire province, resulting in no summer wheat harvest and many autumn seedlings. We have repeatedly reported this matter and have records to prove it. However, the way of heaven is difficult to know, and recently there has been heavy rain and mountain torrents, causing disasters everywhere. People and animals have been killed, and houses have been submerged. Now, more than 40 counties have requested relief, and more than three million people are dying. Their survival is imminent. Chairman Shao and the Relief Association have been appealing for help. We urgently hope for relief. However, the disaster is getting bigger and bigger, and there is no way to save it. If we do not allocate large sums of money, these millions of disaster victims will either fall into ditches or take risks. Seeing this dangerous situation, we are extremely worried. The Shaanxi Disaster Relief United Association respectfully requests.</p>

<h3 id="e146">Watching the Arrest of the Murderer in the Cased Corpse Case <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>=The Portuguese Consul Only Signed the Arrest Warrant Yesterday Afternoon After the Police Station Presented Evidence=</p>
<p>=The Murderer's Brothers Were Arrested at the Same Time; the Family Members Did Not Seem Alarmed at All=</p>
<p>│Currently Temporarily Detained in the West Prison on Xiamen Road; the Portuguese Consul is Scheduled to Hold a Preliminary Hearing This Morning│</p>
<p>The sensational cased corpse case, after several changes, was not until the 12th that the chief of the Japanese consulate police, Hanari, worked hard to investigate and found the principal offender. Because the Portuguese consul delayed the issuance of the arrest warrant until noon yesterday, the murderer and his accomplice, who moved the corpse to Japan, were arrested under the heavy encirclement of the police station and the Japanese consulate police. The two murderers have been sent to the West Prison on Xiamen Road to await interrogation. The details of the arrest yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e147">It Took One Week from Discovery to Solving the Case <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The cased corpse case discovered in the Shanghai Maru ship occurred on the 7th of this month, and Shanghai's investigation also began on that day. Initially, it was difficult to find clues, and the Russian was initially suspected. Then, Chen Qiaoying was mistakenly identified. It was not until the 10th that Chen Qiaoying went to the Japanese consulate to prove that it was untrue. The chief of the Japanese police station, Hanari, and the police chiefs Aika and Sato, spent more than twenty hours investigating, and as a result, the location of the principal offender and the details of the tragic murder were found. Then they surrounded the location to prevent the criminal from escaping. The speed of solving the case was truly astonishing. However, due to the relationship of extraterritoriality, foreigners could not be immediately arrested for committing crimes in the concession. An arrest warrant must be requested from the consul of their country of residence before they can be arrested. Portuguese Consul Xue Erfo delayed the arrest warrant requested by the police station for this arrest from the 11th until noon yesterday. It took exactly one week from the discovery of the case to the capture of the principal offender.</p>
<h3 id="e148">The Portuguese Consul Signed the Arrest Warrant at Noon Yesterday <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Since the morning of the 11th, the Japanese consulate sent police detectives to surround the house where the murderer lived at No. C-174, Yifeng Lane, Kunshan Road. Hanari immediately reported to the Japanese Consul and transferred the case to the Public Concession Police Station for handling. On Saturday, the Board of Works, based on the report of the chief of the Japanese police station, also presented strong evidence and negotiated with Portuguese Consul Xue Erfo stationed in Shanghai to request the issuance of an arrest warrant for the arrest of the murderer, Bade Lie Limidio. Because the time was late that day, there was no reply. The next day was a Sunday rest and office closed, so the arrest warrant was delayed. Until yesterday morning, after the Board of Works urged, Portuguese Consul Xue Erfo finally issued the arrest warrant at 12:30 in the morning and handed it over to the police station for execution.</p>
<h3 id="e149">A Large Force of Police Arrests the Murderer <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After the police station obtained the arrest warrant, it dispatched a large number of detectives around 2:00 PM, led by Western Detective Chief Weishi with more than 20 people, first to the Japanese consulate to meet with the chief of the Japanese police station, Hanari, and Japanese police officers, and went to No. C-174, Yifeng Lane, Kunshan Road. At that time, the house was still surrounded by Japanese police. At that time, there were three arrest warrants: one for the arrest of the principal offender, one for the arrest of the accomplice's brother, and another for permission to enter the house for search. When Western Detective Chief William Earth led the Chinese and Western detectives into No. C-174, Yifeng Lane, the custodial police of the criminal section of the Japanese consulate released the detectives into the house. The idlers watching there were crowded, with as many as two to three thousand people, blocking traffic. Chinese and Western detectives maintained temporary order and closed the iron gate of Yifeng Lane, driving away the idlers. No. C-174 is in the fifth alley of Yifeng Lane. After the Chinese and Western detectives entered the house, they showed the Portuguese Consul's arrest warrant and arrested both the principal offender, Bade Lie Limidio, and the accomplice, the brother of the principal offender, Qiu Sha Fu Limidio.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Sent to the West Prison on Xiamen Road for Temporary Custody <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>When Western Detective Chief Williams of the police station entered the house and showed the arrest warrant signed by the Portuguese Consul, the principal offender, Bade Lie Limidio, and the accomplice, the brother of the principal offender, Qiu Sha Fu Limidio, did not resist and were willing to go to the police station with the Chinese and Western detectives. At the time of the arrest, the family members of the offenders did not show any panic and were calm. Western Detective Chief Williams took the two murderers to Yifeng Lane and had them escorted to the car by the detectives. It was heard that because the Portuguese consulate had no place for detention, they were sent to the West Prison on Xiamen Road for temporary custody to await interrogation. The murderers were arrested and taken out of the lane at 3:00 PM. The custodial police of the criminal section of the Japanese consulate, who were sent to surround the house to guard the offenders, also withdrew after the murderers were arrested.</p>
<h3 id="e151">The Portuguese Consulate Issued a Statement Yesterday on the Issuance of the Warrant <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the delay in issuing the arrest warrant, the Portuguese Consulate issued a statement yesterday by Mr. Laijie, who signed the warrant, stating that after receiving the notification from the Public Concession Police Station on Saturday, the consulate immediately prepared to issue the arrest warrant. The reason why it was not signed immediately was that the consulate was waiting for the police station to present sufficient evidence. The consulate for arresting the murderer (in black) in the cased corpse case (photographed by Gong Shuxian) should immediately arrest any Portuguese citizen in Shanghai if they commit a crime and will never protect them. Recently, newspapers have reported that the Portuguese consulate deliberately made things difficult, etc. In fact, the reason why the arrest warrant was delayed was not the consulate, but the police station's time-consuming investigation. Now the case has been returned to the Portuguese consulate for interrogation, but because Portugal has no prison in Shanghai and no establishment of the Ancha Envoy Department, it is temporarily kept in the West Prison on Xiamen Road to await the Portuguese consulate's interrogation at any time. It is learned that the Portuguese consulate will interrogate the offender at the consulate at 11:00 AM this morning.</p>

<p>The principal offender, Bade Lie Limidio, and the accomplice, are both of extremely poor character. According to the gatekeeper of Yifeng Lane, the two brothers often committed crimes against vendors in the lane. Not long ago, they beat a vendor in the lane. They had been to the police station, and the case had not yet been closed. In addition, they owed a lot of goods in various stores, and there were often people who came to the door to ask for them and were insulted by the two. Therefore, people in the neighborhood despise the behavior of these two.</p>

<p>The chief of the criminal section of the Japanese Kobe Water Police Department, Mr. Lin, has been dispatched to Shanghai to handle this cased corpse case. Mr. Lin took the Japanese ship Nagasaki Maru, which was scheduled to arrive in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday. The Japanese consulate in Shanghai has received a telegram. It is heard that the body of the victim will also be transported to Shanghai by the Nagasaki Maru yesterday.</p>

<p>=But No Case Has Occurred in This City=</p>
<p>=The Empty Car Was Found on the Bund of Sima Road=</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a taxi rented from the Far East Automobile Company at No. 1 Pingliang Road, Yangshupu, was hijacked on Jungong Road. The empty car was found in the afternoon. After a thorough investigation by the city's police agencies, no case was found. The details are described below:</p>
<h3 id="e155">Four Customers Rent a Car <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>The Far East Automobile Company is located at No. 1 Pingliang Road, Yangpu. At around 8:25 AM yesterday morning, four customers suddenly came to the company. One was wearing a black Xiangyunsha short shirt and pants, and one was wearing a brown suit and white drill pants. They both spoke with Jiangbei accents. There were also two people, one wearing a blue striped silk shirt and pants, and one wearing a blue cloth shirt and pants. They looked like Chinese, but their language was stiff and similar to Japanese. At that time, the person wearing Xiangyunsha went to the company's accounting room and said that he wanted to rent a car to the Yangshupu Electric Light Factory and paid one yuan. The company assigned driver Wu Chunshan, a Ningbo native, to drive a concession license No. 17718 and a city license No. 4370 car out. The four people got into the car one after another and went east.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Hijacking the Car Midway <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, the four people in the car suddenly changed their destination midway,</p>
<p>Ordering the driver to turn to Jungong Road, Yinxiang Port. Driver Wu Chunshan immediately turned to Jungong Road as ordered. When the car was about to drive to the intersection of Jungong Road and Chunjiang Road, one of the four people in the back suddenly used a hemp rope to put around Wu's throat and pulled hard. At the same time, the person wearing the suit took out a pistol and threatened Wu, forbidding him to make a sound. At this time, Wu Chunshan knew that something was wrong and quickly slammed on the brakes. However, another person next to him stuffed a towel into the driver's mouth and dragged him out of the car, tied his hands and feet with a rope, and pushed him aside. They got back into the car and drove it themselves to the concession. Seeing that the car had gone far away, Wu Chunshan struggled hard and managed to break free after a long time. He took the towel out of his mouth and ran to the nearby Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District to report.</p>
<h3 id="e157">Empty Car Found <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>After receiving the report, the precinct immediately dispatched a large number of police officers to search everywhere, but because the time was too late, they found nothing. They immediately returned to the precinct to report. At the same time, driver Wu Chunshan also called the company to report the incident. Therefore, the company immediately reported to Huishan and other police stations, requesting investigation. The Fourth Precinct of the Fifth District also urgently sent telegrams to the General Bureau and various districts, the French Concession, etc., requesting assistance in the search. For a time, detectives were everywhere, and the situation was serious. There were no clues until noon. Unexpectedly, around 4:00 PM, the car was suddenly found near the Bund of Sima Road. After the guard spotted it, he quickly returned to the Central Police Station to report. The police station dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate and found that only an empty car was parked there. They inspected the footprints and handprints in the car, and there was no hurried or chaotic state. They tried to print the fingerprints and footprints left in the car and brought them back to the police station for filing in order to investigate. They also notified the Far East Automobile Company to send a driver to drive the car back around 5:00 PM. However, since the four people hijacked the car, they must have had some intention, but now there is no follow-up, which is very confusing. The Ministry of Industry is Merging</p>
<h3 id="e158">Shanghai-Qingdao Serum Manufacturing Plant <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>=Expand the Scope of Organization; the Plant Site is Still Under Investigation in Shanghai=</p>
<p>=Prepare a Fund of 50 Million Upon Minister Song's Return to the Country to Handle=</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Industry has stated that the domestically produced serum cannot meet the needs of the entire country, resulting in reliance on foreign countries. The number of leaks per year is more than one million. Therefore, it has ordered the Qingdao and Shanghai serum manufacturing plants to proceed with the merger to form a large-scale serum manufacturing plant. The plant site will still be built in Shanghai. As soon as Finance Minister Song returns to the country, a meeting will be held to raise funds to handle it. The news obtained by the Huadong News Agency is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e159">Merger of Two Places <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, animal diseases have been prevalent, and the demand for serum is very high. The Ministry of Industry previously sent letters to Qingdao and Shanghai, each of which has a serum manufacturing plant. However, because the scale is too small and the equipment is lacking, the serum produced is very small. In total, the output of the two manufacturing plants is not enough for the summer season. Now, in order to recover rights and interests and increase serum production, it has been decided to merge the Qingdao and Shanghai plants to form a large-scale serum manufacturing plant.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Sending Personnel to the United States <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the various machines for manufacturing serum, it has been decided to first raise 500,000 yuan to send personnel to the United States to purchase them. This is because the existing machines at the Qingdao and Shanghai manufacturing plants are not only extremely weak in manufacturing capacity, but also mostly no longer applicable. However, this funding matter must await Mr. Song's return to the country before a collective discussion and allocation can be made. At the same time, it will also be decided to hire foreign technicians to improve product quality.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Plant Site Established in Shanghai <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>As for the plant site issue, it has been decided to establish it in Shanghai. The Ministry of Industry will send personnel to Shanghai within days to inspect the site in order to commence construction and proceed with the merger. After this serum plant is officially established, its output quantity must at least be able to supply the entire country's needs, so that it no longer relies on foreign countries. It is estimated that more than a million yuan of foreign outflow can be recovered annually.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Personnel and Administration <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>In addition, all personnel and administrative matters of the plant after its establishment will remain under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry. The position of plant director will be taken over by the director of the Shanghai plant, with the director of the Qingdao plant as his deputy. In addition to the existing personnel from both plants, due to the expanded scale, it is planned to request the transfer of several experienced and knowledgeable officials from the National Health Administration to work at the plant.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Apprentice Starts Fire in the Middle of the Night <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>=Detected by Companion, Prevents Major Disaster=</p>
<p>=Intended to Escape, Resorting to This Last Resort=</p>
<p>│Sentenced to Two Years Imprisonment, Suspended for Five Years│</p>
<p>Zhu Fu'an from Ningbo, only seventeen years old, was an apprentice at the Hexing Machinery Factory at 784 Gongping Road. He has been working at the store for only two months to date. At 1:30 AM on the 13th, while everyone was sound asleep, Fu'an suddenly soaked newspapers in kerosene and placed them in the factory's firewood pile, intending to start a fire. When thick smoke filled the air and flames blazed, fortunately another apprentice in the factory, Xin Xianzhong, woke up and immediately roused everyone. He also reported to the fire brigade. By the time the fire truck arrived, the fire had been extinguished. The incident was reported to the local police station, who took the owner of the factory, Liu Zhixiang, and the apprentices and workers to the police station for questioning. As a result of the investigation, it was discovered that Zhu Fu'an had committed the above-mentioned act, a crime under Article 187 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Wu Zehan presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court. First, the police lawyer reported the above situation, and stated that the police investigation into the reason for Zhu Fu'an's arson revealed that he did not want to work at the factory. However, this reason was not reasonable. He had only been at the factory for two months and wanted to leave. Moreover, even if his wish to leave was granted, he would inevitably be punished by his parents. Therefore, he was still reluctantly working at the factory. However, the factory's mistress, Liu Liu, 20 years old, had a good relationship with the apprentice and treated him very well. All the money for shopping in the store was entrusted to him for safekeeping. Recently, she entrusted him with 25 yuan to purchase items at any time. Later, the factory owner Liu Zhixiang found out that only half of what he had reported had been spent. He severely reprimanded Liu Liu and sent her back to her parents' home. Zhu Fu'an was also reprimanded. The mistress's preferential treatment was also a major reason why Zhu did not immediately leave the factory. Now that the person who treated him well was forced to separate, and he himself had long wanted to leave, he set fire to the store. When questioned, Zhu Fu'an admitted without hesitation. Liu Zhixiang also went to court to testify to everything, and said that the apprentice was young and ignorant. In addition to sending a telegram to his father in Shanghai to take him back and discipline him, he requested the court to be lenient and not impose a heavy sentence. The pro bono lawyer Yan Yinshi rose to defend him. The court sentenced him to two years' imprisonment, suspended for five years, and Judge Wu explained the reasons for the judgment, saying that the defendant's arson only charred the nearby door, and fortunately did not cause a major disaster, so it was treated as an attempted crime. He was still young and his actions were inexcusable. It was hoped that he would repent and start anew, so he was granted a suspended sentence. If he commits another crime during the probation period, it will be executed together.</p>

<p>=Seeking the Most Economical Solution for Short-Term Implementation=</p>
<p>=Negotiations for Electricity Supply in Western Shanghai Temporarily Unresolved=</p>
<p>Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, made the following remarks to people regarding the issue of electricity supply in western Shanghai and other matters.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Negotiations for Electricity Supply in Western Shanghai <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has long paid attention to the issue of electricity supply in western Shanghai. After the central government issued the negotiation principles, the bureau sent personnel to begin negotiations with the Shanghai Power Company. However, the company's views differed greatly from the principles set by the central government, so no results could be obtained for the time being. The problem of the Pujiang water line is that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation is determined to buy it. The Telephone Bureau should meet the needs of the citizens in Pudong, and decided to set up a branch office and expand its business in Pudong. This matter will probably have results soon. As for the five-cent call fee, the Telephone Bureau has started to cancel it since August 1st. Although the Concession uses the temporary contract as an excuse and insists on not allowing it, in order to facilitate traffic in this city, the fee must be canceled. Therefore, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities will continue to assist the Telephone Bureau in negotiating with the Concession telephone company.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Prosperity in the City Center <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>The traffic problem in the city center is related to the prosperity of the city center. Therefore, the municipal government has appointed the directors of the Cai, Shen, and Xu bureaus to discuss the establishment of a tram plan. According to Xu, the plan requires a long period of research, as its route is long and the cost is huge. It is necessary to find the most economical solution so that it can be gradually implemented in the short term. Generally, the construction cost of trams is more economical, so it is planned to lay tram tracks in the future. As for whether it will be operated by business or the city in the future, it is currently difficult to determine.</p>

<p>The Yellow River continues to rise, and has already burst its banks in many places, causing a major disaster. Yesterday morning, a reporter from the Central News Agency asked Zhu Yong, Director of the Public Works Department of the National Economic Commission, about this. According to Zhu, the Yellow River has been rising for days, and has already exceeded the water level of 1931. The association's existing projects in the Mengjin area have reported that the water level in that section is increasing daily, and the situation is extremely dangerous. Labor has already been hired for rescue. According to various predictions, the flood season will pass soon, and the flood may be avoided at that time. However, the association will work with the local water conservancy authorities to do their best to discuss permanent defense measures for current rescue and future prevention.</p>

<p>=Large Number of Opium Pipes Seized=</p>
<p>=Arrested Offenders to Be Punished Separately=</p>
<p>Chief Detective Lu Dagong of the General Police Station learned that someone had privately established an opium den inside No. 258 Jiyi Lane, Nanjing Road, for people to smoke opium. He then reported to the First Special Court and signed a search warrant. At 10:00 AM the day before yesterday, he went to the address with Chief Detective Xing Ziquan of the Chinese police. First, he cracked down on the opium den in the east rear厢房 downstairs, and arrested the owner Chen Baoxiang and four customers, Wang Bingquan, Qian Zongli, Zhang Bingkun, etc. He confiscated 30 gambling books, 77 small boxes of opium, hundreds of empty opium boxes, and many opium pipes and lamps. Then, in the front east厢房, which was a Dingxin Foreign Goods store, he confiscated an opium pipe, an opium lamp, and a jar of opium, and arrested two people, Huang Xiaoquan and Xie Baozhen. In the west廂房 upstairs, which was the Guan Jianji Cloth Store, he confiscated a jar of opium, and arrested one person, Zhu Menggeng. In the west廂房 downstairs, the Fu Cheng Cloth Store, he confiscated a piece of raw opium weighing 31 and a half taels, an opium pipe, and two opium holders, and arrested four people, Song Xianglin, Zhu Ganzhang, Wang Shouming, and Ye Rensheng. All of them were taken back to the police station. Except for Zhu Menggeng, Song Xianglin, Zhu Ganzhang, Wang Shouming, and Ye Rensheng, who were each allowed to be released on bail for 260 yuan, the rest were detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Division of the First Special Court, and the police lawyer Ru Bao Yi explained the case and prosecuted them separately in accordance with Articles 10, 11, and 13 of the Opium Suppression Law. Wang Bingquan and Qian Zongli each hired lawyers Fan Gang and Wu Linkun to defend them. When questioned, Chen Baoxiang denied that the opium den was established by him, and said that it was established by Zhang Bingkun. After a detailed investigation by the court and questioning of the defendants, Court Director Feng Shide then announced the verdict in court, sentencing Zhang Bingkun to one year of imprisonment and a fine of 60 yuan, Chen Baoxiang to two months of imprisonment, Song Xianglin and Zhu Ganzhang each to a fine of 60 yuan, Wang Bingquan, Qian Zongli, and Guan Jianji (i.e. Zhu Menggeng) each to a fine of 30 yuan, Huang Xiaoquan and Xie Baozhen each to a fine of 20 yuan.

<p>The Shenbao-affiliated amateur evening school was established in March of this year. Although it has not been long, its achievements are already quite remarkable. Currently, there are five branch schools in the Mainland Commercial Center, Hongkou, the French Concession, and the western district of the Nanshi area. The day before yesterday (the 13th), at 6:30 PM, the school held a grand gathering of all teachers and students at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, with a common dinner. More than 200 teachers and students from the five schools attended. Principal Shi Liangcai, Vice Principal Li Gongpu, Dean Gu Xuchu, and student representative Luo Youxuan gave speeches one after another. The entertainment included a Hawaiian guitar solo by Mr. Li, two stories and jokes by Guanghua University professor Mang Daling, and a Chinese martial arts performance by Shenbao colleagues Pan, Chen, Xu, and Zhu. Finally, a movie "Raging Torrent" was screened by the Mingxing Film Company. The order was orderly and the group expressed satisfaction. The meeting ended at about 11 o'clock. It was also heard that the first semester of the first school (Mainland Commercial Center) has now ended, and the second semester is scheduled to start on September 1. Russian, Japanese, English and other subjects are all enrolling students. The school also plans to gradually add classes, and each subject must be added to eight classes in order to accommodate students. The fees are also very low and the professors are very serious. The Russian class of the fourth school in Nanshi and the high and primary general classes of the fifth school in the western district are also scheduled to start on the 18th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Ordering Various Editions of Song Dynasty Tripitaka <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>The reprinted Song Dynasty Zhaosha Tripitaka has been selling quite well recently. For example, Mr. Jiang Tesheng from Sichuan, Mr. Mai Taikai from Hong Kong, Mr. Li Shaoye and Mr. Shi Songyan from Tianjin, and the Guangzhou monk from Quanzhou have all mailed money from thousands of miles away to order and reserve from the Reprints of the Song Dynasty Tripitaka Association at 714 Weihaiwei Road, Shanghai. Those who order directly or indirectly in the vicinity are even more numerous. The aspiration and sincerity of Master Xincheng of Pujisi Temple in Gaoyou are particularly rare. The temple is located in Silicun, four miles east of Gaoyou. Master Xincheng raised money to build it. In times of disaster and famine, in a remote place, it actually became a large temple, with magnificent buildings and halls. Every plant and tree comes from the faith and wishes of the four congregations, which is really not easy. One year, bandits came in droves and the whole village was looted, but the temple was not violated at all, and they went to the hall to worship the Buddha. Therefore, the inconceivable power of the Buddha is even more believed and felt by the local people. Master Xincheng has already built a Tripitaka building and personally came to Shanghai to ask for a copy of the Zhaosha Tripitaka to be reserved. He has only raised 100 yuan, which is composed of small amounts of three yuan and two yuan. He will pay in advance, continue to raise money, pay as he receives it, in order to satisfy 525 yuan. However, he needs an extension of the deadline and will use the stored books as collateral. His sincerity and earnestness move everyone who sees it. It is heard that the Song Dynasty Tripitaka Association has approved its accommodating handling.</p>

They witnessed the disaster victims sleeping in the open air and eating in the wind, exposed to the sun and rain, which was extremely miserable. They also learned that a Zhang family child had been burned to death. After investigation, there were a total of 509 households affected by the disaster, with a total of more than 2,500 people, including adults and children. After the meeting, it was decided to provide disaster relief in three grades of four yuan, three yuan, and two yuan.

<h3 id="e173">Revision of Special Price Measures for Cotton Yarn on Two Railways <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>Beneficial to Both Railway and Commercial Parties</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways Approves Trial Implementation for One Year</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways has learned that the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have been transporting cotton yarn and cotton cloth. In the past, due to water transport competition, special prices were set to attract business. It is now found that the special price for this project was originally reported by the merchants for transport, and expired at the end of May this year. However, the special price for this project has been in place for a long time, and it is not applicable. Moreover, the price does not distinguish between high-quality and ordinary cotton yarn, and the freight is charged at 45% less than the third-class less-than-carload freight rate. The freight for精製cotton yarn and cloth is charged at 70% less than the second-class less-than-carload freight rate, and ordinary cotton yarn and cloth are charged at 45% less than the fourth-class less-than-carload freight rate. For example, the freight from Shanghai to Beijing is 1角 per 50 kg for精製and ordinary. This seems to be too much pressure on domestic goods cloth. Therefore, the existence of this special price not only benefits idlers, but also affects the future development of Chinese yarn and cloth. It is really not</p>
<p>The way to promote domestic goods. The ministry has seen this</p>
<p>So it ordered to revise the special price. Recently, the two railway bureaus have submitted a report to the Ministry of Railways for review and abolition of the special price for cotton yarn and cotton cloth, and a revised special price for cotton yarn.</p>
<p>This seems to be beneficial to both the railway and commercial parties. However, the ministry has approved a one-year trial period to observe the effectiveness. The revised special price measures are recorded as follows: 1. High-quality cotton yarn will be reduced by 20% from the third-class freight rate. If the shipper has a certificate from the National Cotton Yarn Industry Association when reporting to the station, it will be reduced by another 20%. For example, the freight for cotton yarn from Shanghai to Beijing without a certificate is 2角 per 50 kg, and the freight for cotton yarn with a certificate is 1角6分. 2. Ordinary cotton yarn will be reduced by 20% from the fourth-class freight rate. If the shipper has a certificate from the National Cotton Yarn Industry Association when reporting to the station, it will be reduced by another 20%. For example, the freight for cotton yarn from Shanghai to Beijing without a certificate is 1角4分 per 50 kg, and the freight for cotton yarn with a certificate is 1角1分. 3. 精製cotton yarn and cloth will be reduced by 20% from the second-class freight rate. If the shipper has a certificate from the National Cotton Yarn Industry Association when reporting to the station, it will be reduced by another 20%. For example, the freight for cotton yarn and cloth from Shanghai to Beijing without a certificate is 2角9分 per 50 kg, and the freight for cotton yarn and cloth with a certificate is 2角3分. 4. Ordinary cotton yarn and cloth will be reduced by 20% from the fourth-class freight rate. If the shipper has a certificate from the National Cotton Yarn Industry Association when reporting to the station, it will be reduced by another 20%. For example, the freight for cotton yarn and cloth from Shanghai to Beijing without a certificate is 1角4分 per 50 kg, and the freight for cotton yarn and cloth with a certificate is 1角1分.</p>
<p>French Concession Citizens' Third Branch</p>
<h3 id="e174">Opposing and Preventing the Operation of Employment Agencies <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>The Guomin News Agency said that the Third District Branch of the Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Union wrote to the French Concession Public Works Bureau yesterday to request that the French police be instructed to order the employment agencies to resume business as soon as possible in response to the French police's prevention of employment agencies from operating. The original letter is as follows: Respectfully, according to a letter from the French Concession Employment Agency Association, the employment agency industry has been operating in the Concession for decades. It has always complied with the Concession rules and there have been no problems. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau has never interfered. Since September of last year, the Public Works Bureau has begun to notify all employment agencies to obtain licenses. Our association followed the rules and paid a registration fee of 2 yuan at the Public Works Bureau on the French Avenue. We have a registration certificate as proof. Up to this year, we have not been urged to renew the license. Unfortunately, yesterday (August 9), the French police prevented the Wan Employment Agency at No. 257 Fuxu Road from operating. Now they are not allowed to open for business and have temporarily suspended operations. However, as it concerns the interests of all citizens in our association, we have to request your association to uphold justice and negotiate strongly so that we can resume business as soon as possible. We are grateful, etc. According to this, since the employment agency industry has paid a registration fee of 2 yuan to your Public Works Bureau in September of last year in accordance with the rules and holds a registration certificate as proof, and has not been urged to renew the license by your Public Works Bureau up to this year, the employment agency association has not violated any regulations. Now the French police suddenly prevented the Wan Employment Agency from operating, which is obviously unwarranted interference. Please trouble your</p>
<p>Public Works Bureau to check the regulations and instruct the French police to order the Wan Employment Agency to resume business as soon as possible to avoid unwarranted losses. The employment agency is fortunate, the citizens are fortunate, (below omitted)</p>
<h3 id="e175">Banning the Giving of Coupons for Cigarette Gifts <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Tax Administration Letter to Cigarette Factory Association</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance Tax Administration has recently seen that cigarette gifts have become increasingly popular. It specially approved the Da Yun Company's request and forwarded a letter to the Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association, notifying all member cigarette factories to stop giving gifts as soon as possible. The letter is recorded as follows: Respectfully, the case according to the repeated approvals of the National Government Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Ticket Office, the method of banning cash gifts from cigarette companies has been communicated to your association to cancel immediately, and to correct the method and order the Tongshui Bureau in the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions to forward the order to the resident factory staff to pay attention to the case. Later, according to a letter from Huadong Company, requesting that the awarding of betel nut cigarettes and empty shells be allowed to end within a limited time, and then the cash would be cancelled and replaced with goods when the lottery tickets were issued next time. After reporting the situation to the Aviation Lottery Ticket Office for review and reply, the reply stated that the company's gift giving was about to expire and it was reasonable to maintain credibility. However, the original letter did not recognize that the company's handling of this lottery ticket promotion affected the promotion of the construction lottery tickets. On the contrary, the original letter stated that the Ministry had prejudices against the company, which was not in the national interest and ignorant of the matter. Now that your department has approved the consultation in the letter, the office can agree to the lenient handling of this matter. The other companies with a long time to give gifts should still be ordered to stop or revise the method first. As for the method of competing for sales when cigarette companies discuss and move sales channels in the future, please also order in advance that the following principles should be strictly observed: 1. No tickets of any kind shall be printed and issued. 2. Cash shall not be used as gifts. 3. The tops of gifts shall not be awarded based on the numbers of formally issued lottery tickets and other tickets. Correspondently, I would like to inform your department for investigation and hope that you will quickly forward the order to all cigarette companies to comply. At the same time, I would like to order the Tongshui Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions to forward the order to the resident factory staff to pay close attention at all times and seriously correct the matter. Aside from directly informing Huadong Company to comply and ordering the Tongshui Bureau of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui regions to inform the resident factory staff, I am writing to your association to inform you for investigation and hope that you will quickly forward the order to all cigarette companies to comply with the matter.</p>

<p>The Zilin News reported that since the local area received a telegram from Hong Kong about the news of 13 Dapeng Bay pirates coming to Shanghai, at 5:30 PM yesterday (13), the Taigu Company's Taiyuan steamer arrived in Shanghai from the south. A large number of detectives from the French Concession police station, together with the customs water police station, guarded the surrounding area of the pier.

<p>Huangshan, near Zhapu, Zhejiang, is located on the coast and has excellent scenery. It is a natural seaside bathing beach. There are many people from all over the world who admire its name and want to visit, but they all feel that transportation is inconvenient, so they cannot get what they want. It is now learned that the Shanghai-Minhang Long-Distance Bus Company has decided to launch a special bus to Zhapu for seaside bathing, starting today, in order to facilitate people from China and abroad to go to seaside bathing. The bus goes directly from Shanghai to Huangshan and departs three times a day. The price is very cheap. It is also heard that the gentry in Zhapu, in view of the fact that a Western youth was washed away by the waves and tragically drowned because he did not know the tide and the depth of the beach, have now set up striking signs to warn all swimmers to prevent future troubles.</p>
<p>120,000 Huge Robbery Case</p>
<h3 id="e177">The Innocent Are Released Yesterday <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The 129,080-yuan mega-robbery case that occurred on Yong'an Street in the French Concession last month has been solved by the French police, who arrested the thieves Zhang Wei-cai, Wang Mao-nan, and Li A-long. They were sent to court for trial. The escaped thief, Da Luo-song, also known as Jiang Gai-yuan, evaded capture, fled to other cities with the stolen goods, and was wanted by the police with a reward. He has not yet been apprehended. Earlier this month, the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau's Detective Squad arrested Da Luo-song's wife, Jiang Qin-shi, and mother-in-law, Qin Zhang-shi, in Zhangjia浜, Pudong, and found 2,000 yuan of the original stolen banknotes in Zhang's home. They were taken to the bureau for interrogation. Subsequently, four men and women, including Da Luo-song's relatives Ma Yong-lian, Ma Yong-chang, Ma Wan-shi, and Da Luo-song's concubine Jiang Ma-shi, were apprehended in Taihe Street, Yangshupu Road, and sent to the First Special District Court. Jin Jiu-lin, Inspector General of the French Police Special Agency, and Deputy Detective Zhou Yao-ting, among others, went to the court and transferred Jiang Qin-shi and Qin Zhang-shi, along with the stolen banknotes and the six men and women including Ma Yong-lian, to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. Details of the case were reported earlier. At 11:30 a.m. yesterday, Judge Li Chang-nian conducted a trial in the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. First, the police lawyer Gu Shou-xi presented the case, stating that the police investigation had found that the first to fifth defendants, Ma Yong-lian, Ma Yong-chang, Ma Wan-shi, Jiang Ma-shi, and Jiang Qin-shi, were not related to the case. Therefore, the police would not prosecute them and requested their release. However, the sixth defendant, Qin Zhang-shi, knowingly received and concealed stolen goods from the robbery. She was charged with receiving stolen goods under Article 376 of the Criminal Code, and the court was requested to handle the case according to the law. The stolen banknotes were presented to the court. Subsequently, Wang Xing-shi, Xu Jin-qing, and Weng Lai-ke, representatives of the Wenzhou banking industry and representatives of the victim, submitted a bond issued by Wu Shao-ting, manager of the Xiaodongmen branch of the Shanghai Bank, requesting the return of the recovered stolen banknotes of 2,000 yuan. The court verified the report, briefly questioned each defendant about their name, and then ordered the five defendants, including Ma Yong-lian, to withdraw. According to Qin Zhang-shi's testimony, she was 45 years old, Da Luo-song was her son-in-law, and the banknotes were sent by Da Luo-song's brother, A-gen, to be temporarily deposited with her. He said he got them from selling forty mu of land in Shandong. The money was placed in a pottery jar in the kitchen and had not been touched. When the Public Security Bureau came to search, the money was still in the jar. She did not know where Da Luo-song was hiding. The court reviewed the testimony and, considering that Zhang-shi was an ignorant woman who did not know the origin of the banknotes and had not touched them afterwards, concluded that she could not be considered guilty. Qin Zhang-shi was acquitted and released in court. The court also ordered that Ma Yong-lian, Ma Yong-chang, Ma Wan-shi, Jiang Ma-shi, and Jiang Qin-shi should be released since the police would not prosecute them. The stolen banknotes were to be returned to the representatives of the victim.</p>

<p>The Chinese First Zhengjia Zhengkai Movable Type Printing Hanwen Zhengkai Printing Bureau, as the first Chinese Zhengkai movable type printing, produces Zhengkai font lead characters that are extremely modern, popular, and artistic. It is especially suitable for printing art publications, bank ledgers, pharmacy inserts, and children's books. Due to the accumulation of printing orders, the bureau is unable to meet the demand universally and has begun selling meticulously cast Zhengkai font lead characters in various sizes. Numerous printing companies in the area, upon hearing the news, have purchased and prepared them. Within a few months, over 160 companies have done so. Generally, customers are benefiting from Zhengkai font lead character printing, especially major banks and pharmacies, which are gradually switching to Zhengkai font typesetting for their ledgers, inserts, and other materials.</p>

<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>Regarding the report in your newspaper on August 8 that five workers from the shipbuilding and woodworking industry, including He Qin and Qu Gen, were detained by the Municipal Party Department after petitioning for their release, it has been found that the Second Branch of the Shipbuilding and Woodworking Workers' Union has repeatedly oppressed workers, and over 200 workers were dissatisfied. They elected He Qin, Qu Gen, Mo Kuan, Su Xiang, and Huo Song as representatives to petition the Municipal Party Department for investigation. Unexpectedly, they were detained. On that day, over 140 workers gathered to petition the Municipal Party Department, demanding the release of the representatives, and the order was excellent. The Public Security Bureau did not send police to suppress them. Dai Youheng, a civil affairs officer from the Municipal Party Department, received them. Finally, Commissioner Lu Jingshi agreed to release them the next morning. The workers were satisfied and withdrew. Now that the Municipal Party Department has investigated and clarified the matter and released them, the details reported in your newspaper are inconsistent with the facts. To avoid confusion, a corresponding letter is sent, hoping that you will investigate and correct it promptly.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Representatives of over 200 Cantonese workers in the shipbuilding and woodworking industry, Huo Yun.</p>
<p>Dated August 14, 1933, Republic of China</p>
<p>Address: No. 553, Dexing Lane, Peng Road</p>
<p>To the Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you on behalf of the abbot of the Sun Temple, Yue Jin, who stated that since the monks have resided in and managed the Sun Temple, they have been dedicated to practicing Buddhism and observing the precepts, and have never deviated from the norms. Unexpectedly, on July 28, the nearby Public Security Bureau, believing false reports from treacherous individuals, suddenly dispatched police officers to the temple and arrested the monks residing there, including Lang Qing, on suspicion of using counterfeit money and participating in gambling flower fairs. After being transferred from the district office to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, they were fortunately found to have no criminal suspicion and were released on bail a few days ago. In its reply to the Shanghai Buddhist Association, the Municipal Public Security Bureau stated, "The case has been fully investigated, and the evidence of guilt against the defendants is insufficient. In addition to complying with the instructions to release them on bail, a corresponding letter is hereby sent." This proves that after the monks were investigated and released, major local newspapers suddenly published news about the case, not only deliberately exaggerating the facts to sensationalize them, but also omitting the fact that the Municipal Public Security Bureau had investigated and determined that the defendants had no criminal suspicion and had allowed them to be released on bail. This situation clearly shows a deliberate attempt to damage the reputation of the temple. Therefore, I have been entrusted to send a letter on behalf of the lawyer to various newspapers, making a clear statement and requesting prompt correction to ensure accuracy.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Lawyer Wu Zhiping</p>

<p>— Xianxian</p>
<p>Everyone knows that things with [round heads and square feet] are [people]. But [people] are not a simple issue and are somewhat mysterious.</p>
<p>If everyone with [round heads and square feet] acted as [unconditional people], the whole world would be [harmonious]. However, [people] also have racial differences.</p>
<p>For example, even if they have the same high noses, blue eyes, and blonde hair, they are divided into [British people] and [American people]. Even among the [people] on the European continent, there are [Germans], [French], [Westerners], and [Russians]. Moreover, even among the [Germans], there is a distinction between [old-brand Germans] and [Jews]. How strange!</p>
<p>Let's talk about the [people] in Asia. Indeed, they all have [round heads and square feet], but those with dark skin and clean-shaven faces are called [Filipinos], those with dark skin and pensive faces are called [Indians], those who are short and wiry are called [Japanese], and those who are large and useless are called [Koreans].</p>
<p>Now let's talk about the [Chinese], who are also [of all kinds] and difficult to understand clearly. The ones we usually come into contact with are [Cantonese], [Ningbo people], [Jiangbei people], [Shandong people], and [Pudong people]. After the September 18th Incident, we also saw many [Manchus] who had entered the Pass. Those who speak a few words of Beijing dialect claim to be [Beijing people], but they speak in a way that [Shanghai people] cannot understand and insist on acting like [Shanghai people].</p>
<p>This is how it is horizontally. Vertically, it is also a [grand spectacle].</p>
<p>Even among [Shanghai people], there is a distinction between [upper-class people] and [lower-class people]. Above the [upper-class people], there are even [great men]. Below the [lower-class people], there are even [minimum people]. Between the [upper-class people] and the [lower-class people], there are also [middle-class people] who are neither upper nor lower. Besides the upper, middle, and lower classes, there is also a type of [loafer] that cannot be classified.</p>
<p>In addition to the upper, middle, and lower classes, [people] are further divided into [lucky people], [blessed people], [scholars], [famous people], [important people], [poor people], [suffering people], [troublemakers], [awkward people], [capable people], [useless people], [fashionable people], [unlucky people], etc., too many to count or describe. Even more strangely, those who grow up on the same land are divided into [city people] and [country people].</p>
<p>[People] are so complicated that they cannot avoid [competing and robbing] and [deceiving each other]. The ideals of [great harmony] and [equality] are only good for deceiving the biggest fools in the world!</p>
<h3 id="e189">Subletter <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Hualing</p>
<p>[Subletters] in Shanghai are truly arrogant. Subtenants fear them like tigers, and even landlords must be cautious in their presence.</p>
<p>Subletters habitually owe landlords rent for two or three months, which is considered polite. However, if subtenants owe subletters rent for ten or fifteen days, they will be met with disdain. A mere [cold shoulder] is not enough; usually, they will be [ordered to move out].</p>
<p>When war broke out in the Chinese area, the concessions also reduced rent for three months. The landlord suffered in silence, while the subletter grinned from ear to ear. Because a three-story building on a kiosk cost twenty yuan, and the top floor cost eighteen yuan, as soon as the rental notice was pasted, the rooms were rented out to refugees before the glue was dry. If subtenants dared to ask for a rent reduction, the subletter would snort and say, "It's already polite not to raise the rent."</p>
<p>The landlord pays for the water bill, so in addition to mopping the floor every day, the subletter must also turn on the tap every night and let it run until dawn, so as not to waste it and give the landlord a freebie. However, for the subtenant's electricity, the subletter implements [blackout drills] as soon as the first strike of twelve o'clock is heard on the Customs bell and locks the [main door]. If the subtenant replaces a 25-candlepower light bulb with a 32-candlepower one, the subletter will immediately come to the door to scold them.</p>
<p>The subletter occupies the public alley for cooking and washing clothes because they rent out the kitchen, claiming to be taking advantage of the landlord. However, if a subtenant who has nothing to do with it puts a footstool in the living room, the subletter will rush to it like chickens fighting for food, accompanied by a group of patching-up workers in cloth short jackets. The seats in second-class trams are not small, but because they are three coppers cheaper, they are packed so tightly that no water can leak through. The ticket seller has to display Zhao Zilong's skills in saving A Dou before Changban Slope in order to cut a bloody path to sell a few tickets. A friend wearing a Hangfang long gown and a Columbia hat is also squeezed into the crowd of sweating and stinking people. On the surface, he is undoubtedly a crane among chickens.</p>
<p>What about the first-class tram? Two disheveled, bare-legged modern misses, a middle-aged woman weighing seventy pounds, and five or six bright-faced, lively-looking middle-class Chinese (Note: Upper-class Chinese ride cars) are sitting there. The lazy people can stretch their legs and fall asleep on the seats. The door in the middle of the tram is like a chasm, clearly dividing the two classes of rich and poor, or rather, the distinction between the proletariat and the middle class. How unfair is this! However, the first-class trains and the officer's cabins of ships often feel frighteningly quiet. At the same time, in the fourth-class trains and the bottom cabins, there is often no place to stand. Running into four or five-story 洋房, sometimes, you can't find half a person in a big circle, but a pigeon-cage-like old house has to accommodate five or six households. "Behind vermilion gates, meat and wine are rancid; on the road lie frozen corpses." The unequal facts of humanity are almost everywhere. Is it only true of trams?</p>
<p>In the past, the trams that passed through Manwete Falong Village from Washington City, USA, and reached the left bank of the Botamai River (George Washington's hometown) separated the seats of white and black people, and the boundaries were extremely strict and could not be crossed. The unfortunate black people became the insulted in an unequal society. Our first and second-class tram seats can be freely taken with money, without any restrictions, and with one kick you are kicked out the door.</p>
<p>The landlord's position is like the position of the first wife. The subletter is like the position of the fierce and shrewish concubine. At the beginning of the year, naturally the concubine has the upper hand. As for the subtenant, it can be said that they are pitiful, being like the master under the concubine's tyranny, as long or as short as she wants. Sometimes the concubine is scolded by the first wife, and naturally it is the master's bad luck.</p>
<p>In Shanghai, subtenants have never been seen who don't stick out their tongues in front of the subletter. What's more, the subletter who has just risen from a subtenant is like 淌白 leaping to become a concubine, and can do anything.</p>
<p>Subtenants will not be able to sleep soundly until the subletters are overthrown.</p>

<p>— Fu Yizhi</p>
<p>The tram on Route 3, "Ding Dong, Ding Dong," is approaching the stop at the intersection of Xinjiao Street. As soon as the iron gate opened, several friends jumped down whom I didn't consciously identify. Compared to black people, isn't it even better? An ancient poem says: "Others ride horses, I ride a donkey, carefully considering it, it's not as good; suddenly looking back at the porter, it's not enough to be better, but it's more than enough to be worse." Friends! May you comfort yourself with this and be patient!</p>

<p>Guan Yaowu held a cigarette in his mouth, listening quietly. When he heard this, he could no longer contain himself. He pressed his hand on the corner of the table, straightening his body, as if about to stand up and speak. Madam Jiang waved her hand and said: "No need to say it, I understand your meaning completely. To tell you the truth, I received the news last night that Commander Zhao is willing to resign his command for this marriage. Don't look down on our girl; she has a mind of her own. She said, 'This is not right; no one should lose their future for the sake of marriage. No girl wants to bear that guilt.' Just Commander Zhao saying this is enough to make people happy. Besides, we didn't have enough to celebrate the New Year last year, and we had to pawn our cotton coats. Thanks to him, he helped us get them back from the pawnshop counter. Now I understand; he pawned his fur coat for the money." Guan Yaowu said: "Strange! How do you know all these things?" Madam Jiang smiled and said: "Don't ask how I know. Are the things I said correct or not?" Guan Yaowu said: "Absolutely right. How can you know so clearly?" Madam Jiang smiled: "I can't tell you the source of my information; if I did, I wouldn't be able to get any more news in the future." Guan Yaowu laughed: "So you plan to keep getting news. Does this mean you approve of this marriage?" Madam Jiang said: "To be honest, I have nothing to say against someone like Commander Zhao. I'm just thinking that soldiers only have public affairs and no private affairs. If my child marries out, she'll still be living like a single woman, so why should I want her to marry out? Because of this, I haven't been able to decide. Now I hear that he also feels that our concerns are valid and is willing to give up being a commander. Not only our girl feels deeply grateful, but I also feel unworthy (158)."</p>

<p>— Bingyu</p>
<p>Because the shape of the lips varies, some thick and some thin, and the structure of the mouth also varies, some large and some small, such as trumpet mouths and carp mouths, there are thousands of differences in size and width. Moreover, the lips and mouth are closely related, and the color of the lips also varies. If artificial means are not used to remedy them, it will affect the beauty of the eyebrows, eyes, nose, and other parts. Now I will talk about the method of applying lipstick: Generally speaking, the color of the lips is different for each person, with some being dark black, pale white, or grayish-red. These lip colors are very unsightly in appearance and cannot attract the enthusiasm of others, so it is necessary to transform the color of the lips. The transformation procedure depends on the size of the mouth and the thickness of the lips. If the person has thick lips and a large mouth, half of the outer side of the lips can be painted with a very light red, and the inner side of the lips should be painted with a dark red. Then, people with large mouths will appear to have small mouths. If the person has a small mouth and thin lips, then both the inner and outer sides of the lips should be painted with a uniformly bright red color, which can naturally make them appear thicker and larger. However, it should not be painted too wide and should be carefully considered. If it is a trumpet mouth, then the upper half of the upper lip and the lower half of the lower lip can be left unpainted, while the lower half of the upper lip and the upper half of the lower lip should be painted with dark red to correct the mouth's shortcomings. Therefore, when applying makeup, never forget the individuality of the lips. Speaking of lip rouge, there is a non-fading red rose-colored rouge. This rouge was originally manufactured by American Dr. Young as a disinfectant for surgical operations and was named Mercury Chromium. At that time, it was only a substitute for iodine. Later, after several trials, even when exposed to water, it would not fade for three or four days. Now, it has become even more advanced, not only with beautiful colors but also with the effects of disinfection and preservation, so it can better exert its appeal when kissing a lover. The above is the key to applying lipstick. Please pay special attention to ladies and modern misses.</p>
<p>The Key to Dyeing Fingernails</p>
<p>The method of dyeing fingernails is very simple, but there are many points that cannot be ignored. The currently popular fingernail styles are roughly the plow-shaped Shade and the iron stone-shaped Diamond, both with sharp angles. After applying peach-colored enamel nail polish, it will produce a beautiful luster. However, when decorating fingernails, you should first consider whether your hands are suitable for decoration. In other words, you should see if your finger shape has the qualification for decoration. Why? Because many people's hands have rough and dark skin, wide and flat finger shapes, and short and thick fingers. No matter how decorated, these hands cannot evoke a sense of beauty. They should possess the elements of "jade-like slender fingers" and "tender as bamboo shoots" to be worthy of decoration. I often see women's hands with dirt accumulated in their fingernails and their fingertips blackened by smoke, while their fingernails are dyed peach red. This is truly contradictory. Therefore, ladies, please first solve the problem of cleanliness from the root before talking about decoration. As for dyeing, there is one point that we should pay special attention to because many viruses often start from manicures, which is a type of whitlow bacteria in medicine. Some even cause the finger joints to become whitlow and numb, and others cause pyogenic sputum due to the invasion of mold from the fingernails. Therefore, when trimming fingernails, they should be disinfected. The current common disinfection method is to first wash away the dirt with lukewarm soapy water, then soak them in a thousand times diluted mercury solution for five minutes, wipe the fingertips dry, and then soak them in a 70% alcohol solution to gradually peel off the epidermis on the fingernails. Finally, apply peach-colored enamel nail polish, so that there will be no dangerous viruses.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Special Article on National Defense Education <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>(IV)</p>
<p>Central University Professor Zhang Qiyun's Speech at Tao Ji's Place</p>
<p>㈣ The greatest purpose of national defense education in rural communities is to enable students to deeply integrate into the people, using the organization of the military to organize society, which we simply call rural covenants. Covenant means restraint or organization. In December of the twentieth year of the Republic, Mr. Ma Xiangbo published a tearful appeal to young people, which expressed this meaning very earnestly. He said, "[The old man believes that the most urgent national salvation strategy today is to imitate the ancient system and implement the Baojia method, linking ten households into one Jia, ten Jia into one Zhongjia, ten Zhongjia into one Dajia, ten Dajia into one Tuan, ten Tuan into one Zhongtuan, and ten Zhongtuan into one Datuan. Extend this further, first creating a register of the population, follow the army's organization, so that its actions are uniform, command is swift, communication is tight, and will is firm. Guiding it to not cooperate with Japan is possible, guiding it to economic severance with Japan is possible, and guiding it to a desperate war with Japan is also possible. The old man has planned it, looking around at the rivers and mountains, I am endlessly saddened, and I hate myself for being old and weak, unable to repay the country, so I place my hopes on you, young students. The old man deeply believes that the country is based on the people, without responsible citizens, the country will have no way to stand. At the same time, I deeply believe that self-help is the only way to save oneself, and only self-help can break through the current difficulties. Seeking help from others, begging for mercy from others, are all in vain. Young people are the backbone of society and the pillars of the future of the country. I hope that we can be of one heart and one mind, and engage in arduous and effective struggle.]" According to Chinese history, it has repeatedly suffered from the invasion of foreign tribes, but the social foundation has been unusually solid, and has never been shaken, and has always achieved the final victory. This cannot but be attributed to the perfection of the ancient rural governance. Ancient rural governance had the Baojia method and the rural covenant method. Baojia was a strict rural organization, and the rural covenant promoted rural morality. This was the foundation of rural governance. There were also community granaries to enrich people's livelihood, and community schools to correct people's morality. Community granaries represented the economic aspect, and community schools represented the educational aspect. In addition, there were village communities representing the religious aspect, totaling five major departments. The undertakings contained in modern local autonomy are only these few, but the names are renewed. Ancient Chinese rural governance attached the greatest importance to the rural covenant system, in order to have leaders with noble character in the countryside, who could use the organization of the army to organize society. I once said in a speech in Chinese Youth China, "[I believe that local autonomy] is an extremely important position in secondary education. Because middle school students are between being able to advance and retreat. If they advance to university, their studies in middle school will be the foundation for further study. Otherwise, if they serve the community, they should also use their knowledge to become the driving force for implementing local autonomy... I believe that graduates of middle schools should become the majority of thoughtful and moral rural people, or leaders of rural people. This is one of the most important missions of China's secondary education." The past cannot be admonished, but the future can still be pursued. Our hope lies entirely in young people, teaching them, educating them, cultivating their noble spirit, patriotic thought, strong will, and deep learning, then the humiliated motherland will have hope of revival.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Lecture Four: Military Training for Young People <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>In recent decades, China will be surrounded by a situation where war is unavoidable, and the whole country must have the determination to reorganize its military equipment and devote itself to the military training of young people. It is necessary to ensure that citizens, when receiving ordinary education, develop the qualifications of soldiers in their hometowns, and these soldiers in their hometowns will then train local reserve forces. Once something happens, no matter where, they will instantly become a formidable enemy. What was most lacking in the European war was manpower. China is not like this now. The number of people who can be and are willing to be volunteers is definitely not small. What is most lacking at present is the talent for military command and organization. A national army is a army of the people, so officers must also be nationalized, that is, in addition to central officers, there must be a large number of local officers or civilian officers to supplement the shortfall. All countries in Europe and the United States have a system of civilian officers, which China can modify and transplant. The time spent by civilian officers accounts for only a small part of their lives, and in the remaining years, they can still indulge in managing their production undertakings, which is called soldiers among farmers or soldiers among workers. In this way, the majority of officers can support themselves, which can reduce the significant burden on national finances. Such soldiers in their hometowns usually promote national defense concepts and strive to bring the military and civilians closer, so that soldiers and the people are integrated into one. When the country is in trouble, spiritual and material support can be endless, and the power of national defense can be infinitely great. Even if the initial war is defeated, and the local defense line is retreated, there is still room for a comeback. Such a large country as China, even if it loses the border provinces, or even if it loses a large metropolis, it cannot determine its death, nor can it stop it from fighting again. The enemy cannot but worry that once the entire Chinese people rise up to counterattack, they will turn defeat into victory. Who is responsible for the military training of young people? This is, of course, the responsibility of central officers. Central officers refer to professional officers who serve for life, and there are specially established central officer schools, which will not be mentioned here. The Supreme Command of the National Army, in accordance with the provisions of the Organic Law of the National Government, belongs entirely to the National Government. All construction, maintenance, and operation of the national army, navy, and air force, as well as all powers relating to military administration and military orders, are entirely controlled by the Central Supreme Military Organ, in order to ensure absolute military unity and that the state does not repeat the past mistakes of military power falling into the hands of others, and establishes a foundation for consolidating national power and enriching national defense. Therefore, civilian officers receive education and command from central officers above, and educate and command the masses below. Civilian officers have both educational and command responsibilities, because being able to educate but not being able to command makes it difficult to connect principles and applications, and schools and troops are separated into two paths. Being able to command but not being able to educate also makes it difficult to perfect the command. Mr. Jiang Baili said, "Only the Chinese say that a person is both civil and military, and Westerners have never said this. I have carefully considered this sentence and it seems to have a symptom. The fundamental reason for China's lack of progress may be due to this. Civil represents knowledge, and military represents power. Praising a person as both civil and military is no different from saying that ordinary people are not good at either, clearly stating that those with knowledge must not have power, and those with power must not have knowledge. If one possesses both, then it is truly rare and valuable. Try to think, if there is knowledge but no power, how can it be implemented, what is the use of knowledge? If there is power but no knowledge, how can it be distinguished, what is the value of power? People must have both knowledge and power, which is a complete talent, but this is an internal matter, so why praise it?"</p>
<p>Due to the limitation of homework on weekdays, students' military training is still not enough, so it is appropriate to use holidays to set up military research classes at the drill sites to study the necessary military academics, and not only on the ground, but also to conduct air and sea military training. Use holidays to train student pilots and student navigators. During the exercises, it is appropriate to assume that the national border is invaded by enemy countries, and study methods of response, such as the speed of mobilization and the agility of action, which can be practiced on the spot. Still fearing that the education of civilian officers is insufficient, the In-hometown Soldiers Association can be reorganized to serve as a central body for discussing military issues. If the sincerity of national defense is accumulated in the heart, then the appearance of heroic courage will be obvious on the outside. The organization of the In-hometown Soldiers Association is public and free. Whenever the government is about to establish military laws or implement a military administration, civilians may gather on their own to discuss it and present their opinions to the authorities. Even if the government has established a law or implemented a policy, it also engages in discussions. If it is right or wrong, continue to ask questions, and then advertise it in the newspapers. The meeting place is in the school, and the discussion of military academics is like discussing philosophy, history, law, and politics, etc. The thinking is active, the will is free, and military magazines are published to publish academic progress. Once the atmosphere is opened, it can naturally give China's military a new face and spirit. Military scholars are only a part of life knowledge, and the connection between this part and other parts must be known. The analysis of this part and the synthesis of the whole must be known. In the past and present, the military officers who can become generals are all rich in ordinary knowledge, can represent the trends of the times, and show the correct direction of life. Those who are uneducated cannot become famous generals.</p>
<p>Former US President Roosevelt, in a speech in San Francisco, promoted military nationalism, saying that he did not want the United States to become Chinafied. Is Chinese culture not permanently suitable for survival in the world? This is a very sad thing to hear, but we can now only use Japan's established facts to defend Mr. Roosevelt's fallacy, which is even more sad. Chinese culture rose from Confucius, and for the subsequent 2,400 years, it has been relied upon by all countries in East Asia. In terms of its form, it is somewhat like a religion, (the Japanese call Confucianism Confucianism), but Confucianism says more about worldly morality, unlike religion, which focuses on transcendent concepts. Confucianism and science go hand in hand without contradicting each other. Its breadth is even greater than that of religion. According to the Japanese scholar Inoue Tetsujiro, Confucianism is a major element of the Meiji education. The cultivation of virtues such as loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, and righteousness, from the spiritual melting and pottery of the Japanese national character, the influence of Confucianism is the greatest. The purpose of Confucianism is to cultivate morality, use the great spirit of individuals to encourage the will of the masses, and today, it is to focus on the cultivation of personality. At the time of the Meiji Restoration, those who were active and dedicated to the development of the new civilization were mostly Confucian scholars. These patriots did not belong to the Zhu Zi school, but to the Yangming school. The Yangming school was smaller in number but produced more heroes, and was the original driving force of the Meiji Restoration. The Yangming school is based on conscience. If conscience sees it as good and righteous, it will definitely implement it. It is more biased towards subjective judgment, regardless of the circumstances in which it is located. Although not without drawbacks, it is rich in the spirit of practice, which is truly enjoyable. Du Xigui went to Japan to inspect the navy, and once visited the naval vice-minister Yamanashi. Yamanashi said that in ancient Chinese books, such as Sun Wu's Art of War, the study of strategy is profound and exquisite, and cannot be compared with modern German strategic books. Now, many students in our country (referring to Japan) study Chinese military books in the army and navy. Marshal Togo is a worshiper of Mr. Wang Yangming. The doctrines of Yangming are admired by Japanese scholars and officials. Du said that when he heard these words, he could not help but sweat profusely.</p>
<p>Today, China's national spirit is declining, and the soul is disappearing. It is impossible to promote the vitality of the army and invigorate the spirit of the army without promoting Confucianism. Confucianism is the national soul of China and the original driving force of all reforms. The greatest sorrow is the death of the heart. China's national heart is on the verge of death. New Confucianism is the only good way to revive this dying national soul. For more than two thousand years, there have been many people like Wang Yangming. How many lessons have been learned in history? Confucianism in China is not only a glorious legacy, but a legacy of strength. The way to restore vitality and the way to encourage courage and victory lies in this. The Chinese people only know that Japan has occupied our territory, but they do not know that before the Japanese army occupied our territory, it first occupied the strategies and tactics of our Mr. Wang Yangming, etc. In recent decades, Japan has studied Wang Yangming, while we have studied Japan. It is a strange thing. Why not directly study our inherent Wang Yangming instead of indirectly studying Wang Yangming? The legacy of Confucius, we do not know how to inherit ourselves, so that it falls into the hands of others, and others use it to attack and defeat us. Abandoning our inherent national treasures and picking up the remains of others is the most painful thing in the world. Military education, the Japanese do it, and they win our country in one fell swoop, and then win the powerful Russia, and dominate East Asia. We do it in our country, but it only creates a situation of chaos and danger, because one is for the country, one is for personal gain, one is for unity, and one is for dispersion. Asking the reason, one cannot help but sigh and hate the general public in China for abandoning the old studies as a common problem. Although the Japanese nation receives Western culture and understands Western academics, it cannot be without its own cultivation. This cultivation comes from Confucianism. Confucius said, "I do not enlighten those who are not eager to learn, nor do I teach those who are not eager to speak." Now that everyone is enthusiastically promoting military training for young people, we cannot help but loudly appeal to awaken our dying national soul. (End)</p>

<p>The National Shanghai College of Commerce in this city, reorganized from the former Business School of National Central University, has always had a good academic atmosphere. However, last autumn, a "Reinstatement Committee" was suddenly organized by the students, and a student strike broke out. Recently, due to the students' excessive actions, the Ministry of Education ordered strict measures to be taken. After deliberation by the college affairs meeting, several students were expelled, which led to attacks on President Xu. Consequently, the Ministry of Education expressed dissatisfaction with Xu, which is the reason for Xu's resignation. It is now known that the newly appointed President Pei Fuheng has arrived in Shanghai and is preparing to take over. Mr. Xu returned to Shanghai yesterday and instructed his staff to prepare for the handover. The text of Mr. Xu's letter to President Pei is reproduced below: [Addressed directly], Received your letter of August 8, informing that you have been appointed by the Ministry of Education as the President of the National Shanghai College of Commerce and instructing me to hand over the affairs, which I have read with respect.

<p>Admission to Read Requires a Reader's Card</p>
<p>The Commercial Library of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has been established for eleven years and has spared no effort in collecting newly published books and magazines. Therefore, more than one hundred people come to the library to read every day. According to the library's usual practice, those who come to the library to read must first fill out an introduction card, which the library exchanges for a reader's card, and then they can enter the library to read. Previously, for the convenience of general readers, the reader's card system was once abolished. However, the library is a public institution, and the people who come to read are from all walks of life, with varying levels of quality, which is unavoidable. It is heard that the library has now restored the reader's card system to show a slight restriction. It is hoped that readers will bring their reader's cards with them when they go to the library in the future to facilitate inspection. Those who do not have a reader's card can ask the library for an introduction card, fill it out according to the format, and exchange it for a reader's card for reading at any time.</p>

<p>The open swimming competition organized by the China Youth Association on Sichuan Road in this city was originally scheduled to be held on the 19th at the association's swimming pool, as reported in this newspaper.

Moreover, the association has always held the principle of popularization, so the reporting deadline has also been changed to 3:00 PM on the 23rd. All Chinese men and women residing in Shanghai who are interested in this sport, regardless of gender or age, can go to the association's sports department to register.

<p>Hong Kong Wins the First Game Eight to Six</p>
<p>Fighting Broke Out in the Second Game</p>
<p>(Hong Kong Correspondent) At 4:00 PM on the 5th, a special softball game was held at the South China Stadium on Caroline Hill. The teams competing were the Honolulu Overseas Chinese team and the Hong Kong South China champions. The strengths of the two sides were evenly matched. Among the Honolulu team members were former representatives of our country's sport, such as Zheng Fa and Yu Bohui, whose skills had long been deeply impressed in our minds. As for the other members, they had also just returned from Honolulu. As for the two Chinese teams, in addition to the Zheng brothers playing for Honolulu, many had also returned from foreign countries. Zhou Longcan, Fang Shuotong, Fang Shuopei, and Chen Lunying returned from California, USA, while Bao Jianhong, Zheng Qingyang, and Zheng Biao returned from Japan. Judging from the above situation, it can be said that the forces were evenly matched, who would say otherwise?</p>
<p>In the game on the 6th, South China finally won eight to six in the ninth inning. It was not that the Honolulu team's skills were inferior to South China's, but rather that the Honolulu team was assembled in an instant and had not yet achieved the same level of coordination as South China. This special competition was a best-of-three series, and the Honolulu team had a great opportunity to counterattack. Although South China won, they could not rest easy. At 4:00 PM on the 7th, the two teams met again at the South China stadium. It was thought that there would be a more intense competition between the two teams, but unfortunately, a fight broke out in the middle, and the game ended unhappily, which is truly a pity. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>In the first game, the entire battle situation was in a state of anxiety. Zheng Qingyang, who had returned from Japan, served as the pitcher for South China and performed admirably. Zhou Longcan's skills are already well known to the readers. Zheng Biao, Chen Lunying, and the Fang brothers were good at hitting and defending, giving the Honolulu team no chance at all. Wu Zhenbang and Bao Jianhong also performed brilliantly. In short, the South China team truly showed its artistry to the public. The Honolulu team, due to Lin Jinyou's absence, had Zheng Fa as the pitcher, who was also able to fulfill his duties. Gao Hannen, Yu Bohui, and Zheng Qiongren were particularly outstanding members of the team. It was only a pity that Liu, who was in charge of right field, lost several times.</p>

<p>In the second game of the Honolulu Overseas Chinese softball team, the original purpose of this special softball competition with the Hong Kong team was to connect feelings and improve skills. However, after the first battle on the 5th, the second game continued at the South China stadium at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Unexpectedly, a fight broke out between the two sides at the beginning of the fourth inning, and a group of people were beaten. Even the peacemakers were affected. As a result, the game ended unhappily. The origin of the incident was that Zheng Qiongren, when at third base, wanted to steal back to his base, but he could not do it, so he returned to third base. At that time, he suddenly pointed at Chen Lunying, saying that he had kicked him. He then got up and beat Chen. Chen resisted, and the two fought each other. At that time, fellow soldiers who saw this wanted to stop it, but it caused misunderstandings among Zheng Xing and others, who thought they were helping Chen, so they suddenly came forward and beat him indiscriminately. Everyone then fought together. The witness, Meifeiao, was also punched in the face while trying to stop the fight. After several attempts to stop the fight, it was finally resolved, but the verbal arguments continued, and another disturbance almost broke out in the locker room. Zhou Longcan was punched in the face, and everyone left in a huff.</p>
<p>After the start of the game, the Honolulu team's first attack was unfavorable, and South China counterattacked. Zheng Biao hit a hit and got on base. Zhou Longcan sent him home, and Chen Lunying sacrificed to hit a home run. Zhou advanced to first base, and then stole third base. Fang Shuopei hit a ball, and Zhou stole home. Fang Shuotong then hit a hit, sending Chen home. Zheng Qingyang also got a hit, and Fang also went home. Bao Jianhong also got a hit, and Zheng also went home. In this inning, South China scored five points. In the second inning, neither side scored. In the third inning, the Honolulu team scored again, while South China scored two points by Fang Shuotong and Deng Qingyang. At the beginning of the fourth inning, Zheng Fa freely advanced to base, stole third base, and took advantage of Zheng Xing's hitting the ball to steal back to home base, but he could not do it, so he returned to third base. He suddenly pointed at Chen Lunying and said that he had kicked him, and a dispute arose, so the game was scattered. At that time, the score was South China winning by seven to one.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Model Essays <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>Don Quixote went crazy from reading chivalry novels, so he became a knight-errant himself, righting wrongs. His relatives knew that it was the books that were to blame, so they asked the barber next door to inspect them. The barber selected a few good ones to keep, and the rest were burned.</p>
<p>Madam B, however, because she was moving, asked me to be the "barber" and "inspect" the books left by her father and brothers, "select a few good ones to keep," and prepare to "burn" the rest that were useless.</p>
<p>When I was inspecting, I found a book titled "Model Essays for Higher Primary School, Volume 4." It should have been in the "burn" list, but I happened to flip through it and saw that the second article was "On the Three Eastern Provinces." After reading it out of curiosity, I couldn't help but "slap the table and exclaim."</p>
<p>The full text is as follows:</p>
<p>"The existence of the Three Eastern Provinces to our country is like a dike to a river. If the dike collapses, the water will come. If the Three Eastern Provinces are lost, the country will perish. This is undeniable. After annexing Korea, the Japanese are eager to extend their hands to the Three Eastern Provinces, regarding them as objects in a bag. Now they openly declare to the public: whether by military force or by commercial teams, they must obtain them. Moreover, their ambition is even more rampant, wanting to invade Eastern Mongolia. Alas, Japanese, why are you willing to be the leader of barbarians, harming your own kind? What justice is there in this world? Bismarck said: "Iron and blood!" I also say: "To protect the Three Eastern Provinces in order to protect China, there is absolutely no hope without iron and blood." The new government is creating and managing, and has no time to devote to the defense of the Three Eastern Provinces. Only the people of the Three Eastern Provinces, born here, growing up here, and living here, how can they bear to be indifferent! Therefore, those who save the Three Eastern Provinces are the people of the Three Eastern Provinces. Those who lose the Three Eastern Provinces are also the people of the Three Eastern Provinces. Think about it, think about it, think about it seriously. Those who covet us, throw your life at them. Throw your life at them, and perhaps the Three Eastern Provinces may have a chance. Otherwise, once the defense is withdrawn, I fear that the whole country will perish with it. In that case, why should we care about this seven-foot body?"</p>
<p>This model essay was published by Shanghai Huiwentang. It is the "revised 16th edition in July of the third year of the Republic of China." The first edition was published in the first year of the Republic of China. The author is Shao Botang. However, according to "Postscript by Cai Cheng of Guyue," Shao Tang died during the "uprising in Chu," and was unable to "witness the republic." Therefore, the original work, where it did not conform to the times, was "reluctantly revised in several places" by Cai. This article "On the Three Eastern Provinces," which mentions the "new government," is also known to be by Cai.</p>
<p>The creation of this article was twenty-two years ago from now, and it is exactly twenty years since the fall of the Three Eastern Provinces. The "new government" mentioned in it is still the Yuan Shikai government. However, twenty years later, isn't the government still "having no time to devote to the defense of the Three Eastern Provinces"? Twenty years later, isn't the "world" still without "justice"? As for the Japanese ambition for Manchuria and Mongolia, the relationship between the Three Eastern Provinces and the whole country, and the need to resist aggression by force, all are accurate. In particular, the phrase "Those who lose the Three Eastern Provinces are also the people of the Three Eastern Provinces" is enough to make the young Marshal Zhang, who was "born here, grew up here, and lived here," bow his head without defense. "How can he bear to be indifferent," but who knew that he would actually be indifferent? What else is there to say!</p>
<p>In the two years since the September 18th Incident, I don't know how many grand and great works have appeared in newspapers and magazines, but who can match these mere two hundred and sixty-one characters from twenty years ago in terms of genuine knowledge and insight, and concise language?</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that China does not lack people of insight. However, people of insight can only write essays. They have more than enough heart but not enough power. National affairs are managed by a different kind of people, so the crisis that was genuinely seen and foreseen twenty years ago finally led to the situation twenty years later, causing the people of twenty years ago to feel the pain of "unfortunately, my words came true."</p>
<p>But if an essay can be done like this, it can truly be a "model."</p>
<h3 id="e221">Talking About China's So-Called [Art Movement] <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Yiye</p>
<p>In China, the art movement is as dark as the political movement. Artists (?) do not want the masses; they are only bent on having their own way, busy building up personal fame and fortune: today, they collude with several important people and celebrities to act as initiators, holding personal exhibitions; tomorrow, they will win over their own cronies and colleagues to run magazines, publish collections of paintings, and brag or mutually flatter each other: then they become masters and painting patriarchs. The achievements of the so-called art movement are only measured by the number of tickets sold for our painting patriarchs' and masters' painting exhibitions and the sales volume of painting collections. Therefore, the corruption in today's Chinese art world is no less than that on the political stage.</p>
<p>However, the real [art movement] is thus greatly misunderstood. Society only knows that someone is an artist, a master, a painting patriarch. And these painting patriarchs and masters are classified as a special class, just like important people and celebrities. As for their artistic accomplishments, what impact art has on society, and our demands and understanding of art, etc., there is no need to talk about it at all, because what the masters and painting patriarchs want is fame and fortune, and society only needs to recognize someone as a master and a painting patriarch, that's enough. The pursuit of fame and fortune and the worship of idols form the scene of the current art movement. This farce is staged year after year, except for making a few swindlers and rascals famous and rich, art will always be divorced from society. This can be seen from the fact that we have had a so-called art movement for nearly twenty years, and beautiful women's calendar posters are still welcomed there, and young artists returning from abroad have to change careers to paint advertisements for beer and cigarettes.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Boss <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Cai Niensun</p>
<p>In the past six months, the boss's face has become more and more gloomy and terrifying.</p>
<p>In the past, although the boss had the air of every boss—majesty, there was sometimes a hint of a smile on his gray face full of smoking addiction; he also talked more, and his tone was gentle with majesty. For example, last year Lao Yu rushed home because his mother was seriously ill, without notifying the boss: when he came back, the boss only said: [In the future, you should tell me first]. No other nagging words.</p>
<p>In the past six months, the situation has been different. His face, that gray face, has no smile; the entire face looks gloomy. And his eyes radiate angry flames intertwined with anger and hatred, looking like he wants to eat people. He speaks very little, and it is always cold, giving people a feeling of severe cold. Every clerk is living in fear, and they are afraid when they see the boss's shadow.</p>
<p>The boss himself doesn't understand why he is so gloomy, he is just annoyed, annoyed that the cloth is not selling. His house is full of cloth that he has received successively in the past six months since the end of last year. He feels heartache when he sees the cloth; he is so heartbroken that he doesn't want to be at home, but he still spends most of his time in the cloth shop.</p>
<p>Every day, he sits as usual on the rattan chair next to the threshold, holding a water pipe and puffing away. At this time, there is silence in the shop. In front of the counter, it looks very deserted because no yarn has been released for half a year. Sometimes, it is rare for one or two rural women to bring cloth, and the clerk stretches lazily, cheers up a little, first measures the length, and then carefully looks at the thickness of the cloth, and in the comparison of the boss's eyes, returns the price: [One string and two! ] [One string and seven! Last month ·······] So the boss coldly opened his mouth aside: [A foot and two heads (Zhuang, that is, a local cloth with a one-foot and two-inch wide facade) I'll take it from you, and you still think it's too little! ] The rural woman argued several times, and finally sold it with heartache.</p>
<p>As the rural woman walked out of the shop, the boss complained sullenly: [People nowadays, what conscience do they have, one foot and two heads, which cloth shop would accept it? I'll take it from him, and they still argue about getting more and think it's too little! ]</p>
<p>The clerks also echoed, but in fact they knew very well in their hearts what was going on.</p>
<p>The cloth is not selling, not only the boss is anxious, but they are also really panicked. Since the Northeast hung up the Rising Sun flag, sales have plummeted. Following the economic decline of overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia, the cloth has also lost a corner of the market. Now there are only the three provinces of Fujian, Guangdong, and Shandong. Foreign cloth is so cheap, who would be happy to buy small, crude local cloth? In this situation, the cloth industry is indeed difficult to sustain, and if it doesn't close down, it will have to lay off a large number of people.</p>
<p>Qin and Zhang, who used to be good at talking, have also gradually become silent: this group of clerks just hope all day long, hoping that the smile on the boss's face will return.</p>
<p>But the boss's face is becoming more and more gloomy and terrifying day by day!</p>

<p>— Fu De</p>
<p>Some things in the world are most taboo to be ordinary, such as: poetry, music, painting, speech, etc.</p>
<p>The lives of heroes make history appear lively, and history makes the behavior of heroes appear beautiful; looking at it this way, should the person who writes history thank the hero who provided them with such lofty material, or should these heroes thank their historians?</p>
<p>The glory and achievements of some people lie in writing well, while others do not write a single word.</p>
<p>A fool reads a book and gets nothing. An ordinary person reads a book and thinks he understands everything. A wise man reads a book and sometimes cannot understand everything. He treats obscurity as obscurity, just as he treats clarity as clarity. A talented person reads a book and often treats clarity as obscurity, and insists on not understanding what is perfectly understandable.</p>
<p>A good and careful writer often feels that the words and sentences he spent a lot of time finding are the most simple and natural, and could have been thought of effortlessly at the beginning.</p>

<p>— Dan Guosun</p>
<p>[Then I'm really sorry! Something happened at your residence, it seems the old gentleman doesn't know yet! ]</p>
<p>[Who are you talking about? ]</p>
<p>[Your respected father. ]</p>
<p>[My father? ]</p>
<p>[Yes, your respected father! ]</p>
<p>[How would my father know! I haven't seen him for two whole days! Have you seen him today? ]</p>
<p>[I have, the old gentleman is still at my house. ]</p>
<p>[Really? ] Bo Tang suddenly stood up, [Is it Chongqing Road? I was just about to talk to my father. ]</p>
<p>After saying that, he grabbed Zichun's sleeve:</p>
<p>[Can we go together? ]</p>
<p>Zichun stood up, and the people in the dining hall also stood up. Everyone seemed to be pushed by an invisible force, and unconsciously followed them out of the dining hall together.</p>
<p>After getting in the car, Bo Tang stretched out his head and said loudly:</p>
<p>[Please take care of things for me for now, Zhiguang; I will have a reply immediately after I see my father. Peiyu, you should make a phone call first······]</p>
<p>In less than half an hour, Zhiguang and Peiyu had received Bo Tang's letter, which meant:</p>
<p>[I have met with the old man, and everything is fundamentally safe now. There is no need to worry about anything. Notify the factory as soon as possible to hand over the supplies according to the agreement. The defense lines of both Yu are withdrawn at the same time. Someone should also be sent to notify Ma Wenqing. I will be back soon, and the rest will be discussed in person·····]</p>
<p>The atmosphere inside and outside this building immediately returned to normal; the words in the letter were also executed separately by Zhiguang and Peiyu. It was not until Bo Tang came back in the evening that everyone knew the origin of Yongsun Gan's wonderful trick: Later, Bo Tang recounted the process:</p>
<p>[They have been there for the eighth day today. It is said that Lao Wu can get more than a thousand yuan a day, and by the morning before yesterday, she had already gotten a very good amount. This is of course all thanks to the old man's face. Zichun felt that this kind of friendship—I'm embarrassed to say it's a favor—should be specially repaid, so the day before yesterday, they decided to take advantage of his thirty-third birthday today to become the old man's godson, and to become a publicly recognized and legitimate godson. The old man certainly had no objection, so they agreed on a date: later, they thought that Zichun was actually one or two years older than me, and it would seem awkward if he suddenly called me brother in the future, so they asked me to be there as well, which meant to ask me to recognize it. They had already set up incense, flowers, and candles in their house, and were preparing to kowtow formally at eight o'clock—that is, at Xu time—we have to hurry up and deliver the gifts·····Haha, isn't it funny! Speaking of gambling, they originally planned to gamble for another three or four days, and they were going to stop after the Lantern Festival, but of course there's no talking about it now······Haha·I heard that the big losers are two famous wastrels in Shanghai, one surnamed Zhou and one surnamed Cheng, and they each lost twenty or thirty thousand! ] Bo Tang said such a long passage with great animation, and then fiddled with his fur robe to tidy up the clothes inside, and continued after a while:</p>
<p>[Isn't it funny! As for me, I'm lucky that my luck is still good, and I'll only have to spend a few more dollars on Ma Wenqing's thank you gift in the future! ······The old man's matter is finally settled: Zhiguang, have we handed over the supplies to Zhabei clearly? ] The next morning, Zhiguang and Representative Qiu and a few others had already walked to Bo Tang's house, and calmly took out a receipt from the ××× Association.</p>

After opening, it was frustrated by the consistent selling of banks, but not much. The HSBC board announced that the UK shrank by .125 and the US dropped by .25. At this time, it was very flat. After entering the market, the exchange market tightened and the gold market also rose. Yuan Mao Yong made the most diligent deliveries and rose. The scope of the increase or decrease in the morning market was not large. The latter market was first low and then hidden. It was only that the internal market of the banks was loose and then flat again. Finally, it was able to recover well because the Bombay telegram reported a drop of four annas. It was found that the daily transactions were due to the relationship between the interbank hedging of US dollars, which seemed to be more supply than demand, but the market was quite firm and people's hearts were better. The potential for short covering was general. The price for delivery today was increased by 190 yuan. The Tianjin gang supplied about 1,000 taels. The forward price for August and September was 4.8 yuan. Today, the forward price for September and October will begin. Now, the market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>

Afterwards, the banks gradually bought in at a low price, and the Chinese merchants were still eager to close, so the situation turned slightly tighter.

<p>Although the summer season has passed and a new coolness has entered the order, it seems that there is a possibility for commerce to start. However, due to the successive natural disasters and man-made calamities in various places, the commercial situation is quite bleak, and the financial business is even more depleted and boring. Therefore, it is difficult for the Shanghai silver and foreign exchange market to have an excellent prospect. Yesterday, the foreign exchange loan interest rate in the market still opened at 5 points, and the head remained white, as if there was no market situation every day, or it was engraved, so it is appropriate that the silver and money industry has no ability to progress.

<p>=Large Investors Have No Activity=</p>
<p>=Retail Transactions are Not Lively Either=</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending upwards, and the situation is somewhat firm. However, real demand has not been seen to be strong. After several days of continuous declines, it has prompted profit-taking short covering, causing a slight surge in the market. However, inferior yarns are being sold at low prices everywhere, which is severely impacting Chinese yarns. The future remains difficult to be optimistic about.</p>
<p>(Renbiao Recovering Over One Yuan) Renbiao opened higher in the morning session, with a lack of sellers in the market causing profit-takers to cover their positions, leading to a rise in the market. The current month rose by seventy-eight cents to one yuan and thirteen cents. The afternoon market was still good, with each month rising by forty cents. The total daily transaction volume was 49,200 bales. It was found that Yuan Da sold 2,950 bales, Ming De sold 1,400 bales, Tong He sold 1,300 bales, Chang Feng sold 1,250 bales, and Xie Sheng sold 1,100 bales.

<p>(Yarn Sales Still Not Weak) Current yarn sales are better. It was found that various guilds bought a total of 685 bales throughout the day, and the market price rose by 50 cents. The purchase amounts of each guild are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 214　Changsha 124　Guangdong 110　Ningbo 15　Shantou 25　Zhenjiang 60　Fellow traders 9　Sichuan 44 The cotton market has declined for several consecutive days, causing short covering, and a sudden rebound has occurred. However, overseas Indian and American cotton markets are inclined downwards. Indian cotton has a bumper harvest this year, so the market sentiment is quite weak and there is still a downward trend. In the afternoon, it was said that the inland Litai factory purchased 8,000 dan of new cotton, which brought a more positive outlook to the market. However, the domestic climate is favorable, and a bumper harvest of new cotton is expected. New Yao cotton from Ningbo arrived in Shanghai and was settled at the exchange for 42 yuan, so there was a large amount of selling from Ningbo.</p>
<p>(Standard Cotton Rebounding by About Forty Cents) Zheng Biao (Standard Cotton) opened in the morning session, with foreign cotton trending downwards, softening the market. Each month only rose by 15 cents. In the afternoon, yarn factories bought in, and it rose by 35 cents, but a large trader dumped as much as possible.

<p>Since the US cotton government report was released, the bulls were shocked and closed their positions one after another. People's hearts inclined to sell. Furthermore, due to public prediction that US cotton would fall again, short positions gradually approached, and the market price plummeted. Spot sales were extremely low. European inquiries were silent. Seasonal rains were still satisfactory, but currently it needs sunny weather adjustment. The statistics of last week are attached below (unit: thousand bales):</p>

<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of each month initially flattened and then continued to rise. The quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago fell back eight or nine cents to one yuan and ten cents, Canada fell two yuan to two yuan and ten cents, so when the opening price, the market atmosphere was quite depressed, but small factories in this and other ports rushed to cover short positions, and also because the Yellow River was flooding, and there was a risk of flooding in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, which made people's hearts quite firm. Although the buying sentiment was strong, this kind of buyer was mostly speculative, and real sales were still rarely inquired. Until the afternoon opening, although it continued to be good for half a cent at first, it then showed a soft trend due to the continuous selling by large factories, especially the long-term. It was found that the current selling price of spot flour must be a separate price, the top-grade brand is three or four cents less, and the second-grade is one cent less, Yangtze River flour and inland flour are as much as one cent and four cents to two cents less, so the hope of over-pricing in the future is unlikely. As a result, this month is good for one cent, September is good for seven and a half li, October is good for two and a half li, November to January is good for five li.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the prices of each month generally showed a weak trend, because the quoted price of foreign wheat fell back, so when the opening price, the recent price fell back by one or two cents, but large short sellers continued to cover, and the chips of new short sellers have not increased greatly, so even though the foreign price has fallen, people's hearts still feel old. Until the afternoon opening, because the flour market turned firm, people's hearts were also good, and the opening price of each month rebounded by three or four cents. However, on the buyer's side, the appetite was very limited due to the low price of rice. As a result, August and September were better for four cents, October was better for three cents, November was better for four cents, December and January were better for three cents. The spot wheat market has seen smooth delivery, but the price is slightly short, Shandong wheat is three yuan and eight cents and seven cents, Yaowan wheat is three yuan and eight cents and a half cents, the second is seven cents and nine cents, Mingguang wheat is three yuan and eight cents and two cents, Taizhou wheat is three yuan and six cents and four cents, Suzhou wheat is three yuan and seven cents and one cent, Chuzhou wheat is three yuan and five cents and one cent, Gaoyou wheat is three yuan and six cents and three cents, the second is five cents and seven cents, Liuhe wheat is three yuan and five cents and four cents, the second is four cents and six cents, Zhenjiang wheat is three yuan and four cents and six cents, the second is three cents and four cents, Qingjiang wheat is three yuan and five cents, Nanjing wheat is three yuan and three cents and a half cents, the second is one cent and a half cents, Qijianyan wheat is three yuan and four cents and nine cents, opening 10,000 bags, handled by Fuxin Xinda.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Rice Market Mediocre Situation <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's source was more than 30 companies. The store appetite on this street was slightly better, and the appetite for bags turned active. However, after a long period of fatigue in the market, it is difficult to improve for a while, and it is still just mediocre. Statistics show that the wholesale appetite is 2,500 or 600 bags, and the prices of thick japonica rice, indica rice, and Dujian rice are not much different. Although there are ups and downs, there are only a few cents of difference. There is no honor or disgrace in the fixed price of the new japonica rice in the factory.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from various roads downstream of the river was about 20 companies. The sales market of each goods in the market is still acceptable. The supply of northern white japonica rice has tightened considerably. Early indica rice and Dongxin japonica rice have all seen a fixed situation. Yangjiandian is strong, and the second is weak. There is a continuous supply of new Kabu indica rice, and the sales appetite is average, and the price is slightly close to a corner. There is not much ups and downs in Chen Kabu indica rice.</p>
<h3 id="e237">Few Indica Rice Goods, Market Stable <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Yangke indica rice market was still stable. Because the stock and arrival of Ke indica rice in the market were small, the cargo owners were unwilling to sell lightly, and the customers disliked the low quality of the goods, and intended to handle the new clean and high-quality rice. There are still more than 200,000 bags of foreign rice in stock. Although foreign merchants have the intention to sell, the price negotiation between the two parties has not been settled, and there has been no transaction so far. Gao Xiaojiao Yangshang is still shouting 7 yuan, and the import household only eats 6 yuan and 7 cents. Therefore, the two sides hold each other, and the market is stagnant. Therefore, if the market is to be active, it must wait until the new Ke indica rice arrives at the port or the price of foreign rice depreciates before it can cause customerization. Yesterday, the whole city handled 95 bags of Hunan Jing rice from Fuzhou, priced at 6 yuan, which was not much different from the previous market. Xiao Jiaojiao had 100 bags of returned goods, priced at 7 yuan, but it cannot be regarded as a formal market.</p>

<p>The source of new yellow beans in Jiujiang has not been surging recently, and the route is still smooth. The Fuzhou and Ningbo gangs in the market have continued to be appetite, but the Zhou Gang has a boat position, so the appetite is healthier. The total sales in the market yesterday were 2,300 or 400 bags, and the selling price continued to rise by 5 cents.</p>

<p>│Other Consistent Continued Increase│</p>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was still strong due to the firm rise in marked gold and the slight contraction in Dutch exchange rates. The public association divided the plate into 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods, which rose by 5 cents to 21 yuan and a half. Slightly higher KW mark was 21 yuan and one cent, 20 medium sand white Gaozhuang P mark was 20 yuan, four cents and seven and a half ordinary triangle, Dutch red KD mark was 10 yuan, six cents and a half, KNG mark was 16 yuan and four cents and a half.

<p>It was initially reported that the harvest of Quanzhou longan fruit would be abundant this year, but it was greatly reduced due to wind damage, turning into a poor harvest. Now it is the first harvest. It was found that the first batch of new goods arrived yesterday on the Fudong wheel, totaling hundreds of boxes.

<p>Jiang Yao, also known as Yu Yu, is produced in the offshore waters. The shell is long and thin, making a right triangle. The surface has scales, arranged in a radial shape. The inside of the shell is black with a slight shimmer. The meat is not edible, but the two pillars before and after it are very delicious. Take it down and dry it in the sun, sell it for food, which is Jiang Yaozhu, commonly known as dried scallops.</p>
<p>Jiang Yaozhu is a must-have item for restaurants, and ordinary people often eat it, and it is often listed as a common dish, so the sales are quite wide, but Japanese goods are the majority. Domestic products include Yantai dried scallops, which are in good shape and the price is relatively cheap. Now it is described in detail, so that consumers can know how to identify when buying and using.</p>
<p>Yantai dried scallops, the color is tender yellow, but there is no bright light, the shape is like a short cylinder, the size is different, the taste is fresh and tender. Japanese goods have round grains, triangular two kinds, produced in Japan Hakone, Kitami, Aomori, etc., the difference between it and Yantai goods, in addition to the triangular dried scallops are irregular polygonal, the shape is obviously different, it can be known at a glance. Round dried scallops, the color is bright yellow, slightly bright, the silk pattern is more delicate, although the shape is the same as a cylinder, but if you look closely, the middle part of the Japanese goods is larger, and the upper and lower ends are slightly smaller, like the gongs and drums in the old medicine reputation, and the Yantai goods are neat up and down, without much difference. If the two types are compared at the same time, it is not difficult to distinguish. The current market price of Yantai goods is about 110 yuan, and Japanese goods increase by about 10% to 20%.</p>
<p>Jiang Yaozhu has many uses, and here is one of them. Half a tael of dried scallops, soaked in water, three fresh eggs, shelled and beaten thoroughly, put in the pot and stir-fry, add one or two scallions, lightly sprinkle yellow wine, add salty heads, and eat it when it is cooked. Its taste is rich, fat and delicious, and incomparable.</p>

<h3 id="e244">Advertising and Modern Commerce and Culture <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>Sitting in a scorching small room, my chest feels strangely greasy and my mind is strangely hazy. I idly chatted with Mr. Wu about things that had nothing to do with me, and gradually we talked about the key to success in modern commerce. The first, of course, is to have strong capital, because modern commerce is absolutely a matter of [big frogs eating small frogs] and [cats catching mice]. Without large capital, one cannot independently form a [trust], and will inevitably not only fail to profit or monopolize, but will also lose money and collapse. The second is to rely on the blind, reckless hype of advertising, which confuses the consumer's innate decision-making power and makes them feel wholeheartedly convinced. As for things like so-called [speculation] and [established brands], these are minor details that are not of great importance. Take the several trust-like businesses in Shanghai: ×× candy store, ×× foreign goods company, ×× national medicine store, ×× tea store, all have many as a dozen branches, and at least three or five branches. Since the capital is strong, large-scale advertisements are frequently published in daily newspapers, so customers flock to them, naturally benefiting several times over and the business is very developed. The remaining small stores in the same industry are either closing their doors and renting out, or selling off their stock. But as for ×× calligraphy and painting supplies store, since the capital is strong (with countless branches), and the hype is deafening, it has declined like silk and satin companies and Chinese-style shoe stores. This is because of the decline of Chinese culture: fountain pens have replaced writing brushes, Western clothing has replaced Chinese clothing, and leather shoes have replaced cloth shoes. This is an exceptional, major issue of national importance, which cannot be fully discussed here.</p>
<p>Speaking of culture, advertising has become even more of a captive of culture. To put it more strongly, modern culture is almost advertising culture. Without the help of advertising, it would be as difficult to open a business as it is for a small store.</p>
<p>××'s White Turbidity Pills, although a family secret passed down for generations, are miraculously effective, but they still need to be advertised frequently in various newspapers in special fonts. Only in this way can patriotic compatriots, if they happen to suffer from white turbidity, pry open their money boxes and rush to buy ××'s White Turbidity Pills, one box to eradicate the root cause. Even if one box does not eradicate the root cause (obviously not as effective as advertised), they will comfort themselves: [It's probably because the disease has penetrated the bone marrow, and another box is needed.]</p>
<p>Before ××, a great physician, hangs up his medicine gourd, he always wants to persuade several important celebrities to publish an introductory advertisement first. The author once suffered from an illness in City C, and invited a doctor to see him. He refused the fee, only saying that he wanted me to publish an acknowledgment in the newspaper in the future. Unfortunately, he did not cure my illness, and I have not published the announcement to this day.</p>
<p>Just looking at these few examples of medicine and culture, one can know the great magic of advertising. (The medical and pharmaceutical industry is one of the broader cultures.)</p>
<p>And look, the era is the summer of 1933. In the education sector, schools are busy enrolling students, and in the publishing sector, elementary school textbooks are selling too much, and general publications and newspapers are booming. This is not only the situation since the [September 18th] [January 28th] incidents, but also the unprecedented excitement of the past three or four years.</p>
<p>It is necessary for schools to advertise for enrollment, but it is not necessary to brag so much in the advertisement. The chairman is a famous celebrity, the principal is a doctoral degree, the school scenery is how, the curriculum is how practical, the history is how long, etc., all of which are boasted up, the purpose is to confuse the eyes of the candidates. There are even those who publish their cheap advertisements in the educational news, so that it is not difficult to attract students.</p>
<p>When advertising textbooks, it is necessary to print the comments drawn from various parties, and it is necessary to print the titles of the reviewers │ │ what expert director and director of the education bureau. In fact, the so-called comments are all a few common phrases. It often happens that the same can be seen on the textbook advertisements of other companies, which is because some kind old gentlemen gave the comments to this company, and stuffed it into the pockets of the people who asked for it from that company, resulting in such a joke. There is nothing else, sales depend on advertising and publicity, and the fundamental way out lies in advertising.</p>
<p>When publishing publications and newspapers, it is necessary to invite celebrities to write inscriptions, famous painters to draw covers, and to specifically bring up the names of old writers for publicity. When reprinting, it is necessary to compile [rave reviews] [collection], forge readers' commendation letters, and blindly boast and praise themselves.</p>
<p>In short, culture must rely on advertising to sway people, which is the characteristic of culture at this stage, and it is also the inevitable distortion of culture at this stage.</p>

<p>— Xu Lichang</p>
<p>Following the Original Rhyme of General Su's Recent Works in Wumen</p>
<p>Sad clouds rise over the Liaohai to the sound of dusk bugles, how many households are there among the sparse millet, to whom can one ask about the rise and fall of mountains and rivers, different dreams in the same bed scatter like sand.</p>

<h3 id="e246">Side Business of Rickshaw Pullers <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Mei Cang</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, many passengers traveling between here have switched from trains and ships to cars. This Shanghai bus station is attached to the Nanbu Station, Songjiang, in the Minhang area of Shanghai. I, who was born and raised in Songjiang and work in Shanghai, took a long-distance bus to Shanghai with a friend on Monday morning last week. Once we arrived at our destination, rickshaw pullers swarmed to solicit business as usual. For the price of two dimes, one of them pulled us to Fourth Avenue. Two vehicles using people as horses were rushing forward. When I write to this point, I can only describe how the construction in the Chinese area is progressing and how the market is recovering after the war. It is not the whole story. When the car arrived at the Shanghai Local Court (formerly known as the Local Office before the establishment of the judicial authorities in the Chinese area), the two horse-powered rickshaw pullers suddenly stopped the car and said to me, "Sir, the sun is so hot, let me put up the canopy for you to shade you." As soon as he finished speaking, half of his body was pressed tightly against mine. I saw him holding up the canopy with one hand, and heard him shouting in his mouth; "Oh! The canopy is broken!" At the same time, I felt a rough, foreign force attacking my money clip at the edge of my short shirt pocket. Haha, although I have never passed three levels or opened a pier, I immediately recognized their mystery at that time, and immediately asked him in a warning tone what he was doing. Unexpectedly, there were many unexpected things. Not only did he not stop his behavior at that time, but he even used a strong grab-style move to try to get his object (money clip). At this time, I jumped out of the car and negotiated with him, and then cut off his idea. At the same time, my friend also encountered the same move, but the entry point of his article was named after teasing his long shirt, and the real thing was stealing. After two discussions, I realized that most of the rickshaw pullers in this section also have this job. If one person succeeds and the victim shouts, they come in groups to persuade them, and their doctrine is to let the successful rickshaw puller go, and pull this victim to Laoximen at a very low price, so their cars only have notifications from the Chinese area. The reason why they want to take business in the concession is only to do this trick and then pull you to the junction of the Chinese and foreign concessions, and call a car to the concession for you. As for when they start, the distance from the patrol police's post is very far, so even if you shout, it is difficult to hear.</p>
<h3 id="e247">They have been able to achieve victory on the battle line of life <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Jack</p>
<p>This is the sign of [×× Layman's Fortune Telling Hall] that I see every day when I pass by, on both sides of the door; commenting on the noble creation of [a certain important person] and the noble character of [×× General], etc. In addition, there are portraits of important people of the era hanging, arranged in five colors without order.</p>
<p>Every time I pass by, there is at least one person having their fortune told, or finding that day in the stems and branches [the universe is turning]? [Wealth and Silk are smooth]? Strange: Since the government established Nanjing: the Central Party Headquarters has repeatedly ordered the serious crackdown on [astrology] and [fortune telling] in various provinces, counties, cities, and towns. Why is it that in this prosperous metropolis; not afraid that is where the government is located, Nanjing││there are also many doing such business in the Confucius Temple now. The government did not really crack down, otherwise many literati who rely on this life would have to go to the road to ask for the masters to call the ladies. But the real masters and ladies. And they do not live on the road, walking on the road is a very ordinary person</p>
<p>Seeing that his business is not bad, fortune telling for one cent, face reading for two cents, talking about fate for four cents, detailed life review for one yuan,······ the price, I also sacrificed a cent, and talked to him boredly, and I can also ask about his living conditions. Walking in, he saw me:</p>
<p>[Sir, please sit down, what's your last name?·····] I also talked to him for a set, and he began to frown, looking carefully for a while:</p>
<p>"Sir, this appearance is a "smart appearance," really one in a thousand, but it hurts parents, it must be "father died before mother" is it"? I nodded slightly, and he became even more proud:</p>
<p>"You are extremely loyal to your friends, but you can endure hardship but you can't stand being angry; you only have a false name for your career, you can't save money, you are harmed by villains this year, and the main thing is a bit of verbal conflict; good luck will only come next year."</p>
<p>Finally, I pulled out a corner from my pocket and gave it to him:</p>
<p>"Sir, how much do you get in daily profit from fortune telling"?</p>
<p>"Haha! It's very difficult, three or four yuan if it's good, one or two yuan if it's deserted. One or two yuan, how can this be enough for us to share our brains? "But his fairy words and wonderful words to the fortune-tellers or the life-seekers; this is a double-barreled word that is generally not too bad for any young people, or another kind of person. No wonder the general foolish men and women praise them as living gods, and go to ask for worship at all times.</p>
<p>According to reports: "A certain fortune teller arrived in Shanghai and stayed at the ×× Hotel on Nanjing Road. Dozens of people come to the door every day by car to ask for fortune-telling." I think: In modern China, there are openly such people who have achieved victory on the front line of life, and are on par with the general rich and noble people who go in and out of big hotels and live in rooms that cost a dozen yuan a month. This shows that Chinese scholars (I call them Chinese scientists) are admired by the general "rich" and "important people," and they are truly worthy of being a famous "Divine State Ancient Country."</p>

<p>— Ms. Yan Yan</p>
<p>One day, I went to Hongkou Park with my seven-year-old younger sister.</p>
<p>The swings are the most cherished by children. Indeed, they are quite good. Swinging gently gives one a feeling of floating in the air. Moreover, the gentle summer breeze is so comfortable and pleasant!</p>
<p>There were already five or six children standing beside the swings. Because my younger sister arrived first, she was able to occupy a spot. She probably used it for twenty minutes. A Japanese woman with two children smiled and said to me in a very Shanghai-accented way:</p>
<p>"China Miss! Please ask your younger sister to stop for a moment, and let my little darling play for a while. I will return it to you later!"</p>
<p>I was neither for nor against it, but I was a little hesitant in my heart, because other Chinese children beside me had also made reservations with me. Now, several children wanted to play. I didn't know who to let go first.</p>
<p>Seeing that I had no expression, she said further:</p>
<p>"I came before them. This is a park!"</p>
<p>She said the word "park" very loudly, as if telling me to recognize that it was a park and that I should know the rules. Indeed, she came before them. According to reason, I should let her go first. However, the concept of the nation hovered in my mind. How could I not hesitate?</p>
<p>Finally, I asked my younger sister to give it to the Japanese woman. However, a reproachful voice immediately entered my ears: "Why did you give it to her? Why not give it to your own Chinese people? You are truly a complete slave of a fallen nation..."</p>
<p>I was scolded by them, and my heart was immediately confused. I regretted that I should not have given it to the Japanese, but I planned to argue with them. I didn't even know what to say. I only felt a little dizzy.</p>
<p>I could no longer stand in the park. I took my sister's hand and ran desperately out of the park, jumping onto a "Route 1" bus that was about to leave.</p>
<p>The wheels were shaking, and at the same time, my heart was still uneasy.</p>

<p>I have a very difficult problem to solve. I have long wanted to write to you for advice, because I can't write well, and I'm afraid you won't like it. Now I am wandering all night and have no other way. So I have no choice but to write this letter to ask you for advice, hoping that you will not refuse my request. Please give me your honest guidance, like precious jade, to lead me out of my confusion! When I was nineteen years old (i.e., 1930), I worked as a junior clerk in a tobacco company. But unfortunately, I didn't serve for half a year before I had a serious illness that brought me back from the dead. Later, I finally recovered, but my ears were deafened by the illness. The ringing in my ears was so loud and painful. I was inexplicably frustrated and disheartened. When the company stopped my business, there was no reason to argue, so I had to go back to eat my hometown rice.</p>
<p>Time flies, and three years have passed in a hurry. During these three years, I have consulted many famous doctors. But none of them have worked, and I have spent a lot of money. Inevitably, it added a lot of economic pressure, the family's fortunes declined, and disputes and ridicule often arose, which were unbearable. As a last resort, I finally came to rely on my relatives for recommendations in March of this year, but so far, all my plans have failed. Maybe it's because I'm old and deaf? I think you, sir, have seen and heard a lot, so you must be able to explain this problem for me. I don't know if there are any specialist doctors for the elderly and deaf in Shanghai. Please introduce me! If I can escape this sea of suffering, I will be grateful. If it has become an incurable disease, then I want to ask you for the second step. What can the deaf do to serve? Or what kind of industry can I learn in a short time? If there is no one who can do it, then there is no place for me in this society? This is my last and only hope. Please give me a gospel. Sincerely yours, Ren Zhensheng</p>

<p>Editor's Note: The causes of deafness can generally be divided into two types: The first is the deformity, incompleteness, obstruction, or damage of the auditory organs. Except for a few very simple symptoms, most of this type of deafness is untreatable. Although someone has recently invented a very sophisticated hearing aid, claiming that those who use it can turn deafness into hearing, it is still in the experimental stage and cannot be widely adopted. The second is the weakness of the constitution, which affects the auditory nerves, resulting in complete hearing loss. Most of this type of deafness has the hope of being cured. Because if we use medicine to gradually strengthen the constitution, the auditory nerves will naturally become gradually active.</p>
<p>Whether Mr. Ren's deafness can be cured, it is best to consult a competent Western doctor for diagnosis. According to what we know, there is a German doctor named Aks across from the Youth Association on Sichuan Road in this city. He is very confident in ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and stomatology. You can ask him to diagnose you and ask him if he has any hope of curing you.</p>
<p>If the result of the diagnosis is unfortunately [incurable], then don't be discouraged and say such absolute things as [there is no place for me in the world]. You must know that there are many things in the world that deaf people can do. Moreover, there are several things that [must be done by the deaf]! As for writing them down item by item, it is not possible within the space here, and there are questions about whether you can find what you want and whether you can be competent. So I am publishing your letter publicly here, hoping that a kind hand will reach out from this vast society to help you!</p>

<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>(28) The Third Mistress greedily looked at his departing figure without answering.</p>
<p>"Ah, Brother Qiao, are you angry with me?"</p>
<p>Still no answer.</p>
<p>"Won't you forgive me?" | "Fortunately... Wang Hua has been kidnapped now!" Shi Qiao wanted to ask for clarification, but didn't.</p>
<p>"He was kidnapped last night, led by that Long Fa. They say it's not just kidnapping for money, his life is probably in danger! Can you find a way to save Jiefu? Only Jiefu and Wang Hua were kidnapped!"</p>
<p>Shi Qiao understood most of it. He was about to leave to call for a rickshaw. The Third Mistress approached him pleadingly, trying to grab his hand:</p>
<p>"I heard last night that Wang Hua said you were coming back in the next few days, so I was going to rush back to see you. Unfortunately, this happened, making me anxious for half the night with no news at all. It's all Jiefu's fault. Last night at Zhao Yishan's house, when they heard firecrackers, some advocated still watching the fun, while others said that maybe the war situation had changed and the discussion of the free market could be slowed down, and that this kind of thing was not guaranteed to work anyway. It was him and Wu Ziqing who insisted on continuing. Well, Long Fa led a dozen people with guns to rush in." Shi Qiao heard everything and secretly felt happy, but he didn't show any expression on his face, which made the Third Mistress unable to be coquettish or seductive. Fortunately, it wasn't quite dawn yet, and she was still able to grab Shi Qiao's hand in the dim light, not afraid of the rickshaw pullers peeking:</p>
<p>"Brother Qiao, forgive me, let's talk in the room!" | "Brother Qiao, from now on, I'll only listen to you, I'm only yours."</p>
<p>But Shi Qiao didn't want to. As if he had been stung by a needle, he fiercely shook off her hand and went forward to shout for a rickshaw.</p>
<p>The car stopped in front of the house a little further away, and the Third Mistress had no choice but to go upstairs in disappointment. It was good to see Shi Qiao's at the door, pretending not to be in the room, and walking to the balcony to look downstairs, pouting, but no one came to buy her account.</p>
