<p>（倫敦）　工黨領袖藍斯堡今日在下院發激昻言論、請英政府重行考慮外相西門在日内瓦軍縮會議所宣佈英國保留天空轟擊用於警備之决議、並問政府是否縱破壞軍縮會議亦不許改變其態度、樞密院主席包爾溫聲稱、政府於一再考慮後、始有此决議、去年十一月即將此議通知國會、渠殊不能承認此種决議可破壞軍縮會議之建議云、（三十日路透電）</p>

<p>羅馬　今日起草四强公約最後稿之專家、删除關於軍縮之第三欵、加入規定修改和約新條欵、因軍縮條文將根據英首相所提軍縮公約草案另行協定、故特删去、修改和約一節係意英德所主張、經向法國保證、不致影響小恊約及波蘭現有地位、與始終經由國聯辦理後、始得法人同意、現料最後草案今日下午可在羅馬草成、（三十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>「侵略國」界說之爭</h3>
<p>法國主張自然運用制裁</p>
<p>英國畏縮不願牽入漩渦</p>
<p>又在覓取折衷辦法</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　侵略國界說問題、因軍縮會議總委員會過去兩日討論之結果、已發現意見大相參差之處、法國及其他若干國欲得確定不移之界說、庶發生侵略案件時即可自然的施用制裁、而英國則欲較有伸縮性之界說、庶不致妨害判斷與行動之獨立、美國雖不直接有關、然以英國見解爲然、希臘代表波立狄斯所擬無保留的處理此問題之草案、爲法代表彭古所接受、中代表顧維鈞亦發言贊助之、其言曰、依吾人之意見、此案乃有益的標準、可决定孰爲侵略國、目前關於侵略國之界說、未有一定的條文、致使議論龐雜、協定不能即時成立、查侵略案件、時間乃一重要原素、如有關於侵略國界說之協定、足以增進守全之觀念、以侵略國有所憚而不爲也、或謂縷舉侵略行爲、未必有益、因人類狡譎、尤以較富於謀略之國爲甚、將閃避其行爲而調節其動作、庶以其手腕行侵略之實、而不居侵略之名、果如此說一則明白的侵略條文、不能增進國際公道與夫世界和平之旨趣、反而破壤之矣、然據中國代表觀之、决定侵略條文、縱不完備、究比毫無條文之爲愈也、爲此理由、中代表團贊成草案有關於侵略國界說之第二條文者之成立云、德匈代表發言反對此草案、最後因主席漢德森之提議、决定舉行一種會議、由希臘波立狄斯主席、並由意見全反之英俄代表出席討論、以期覓取折中辦法、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>軍縮會討論禁止學戰爭</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>我國應對軍縮有保留條件　寶</h3>
<p>我中國代表在軍縮會議席上宣言。「我國海岸　　長　　有海軍　　毘連領海之領土。不時遭受侵略國陸海空軍之武裝侵犯。放我國所遭受之侵略戰爭來有最後解决時。將不受任何束縳。…并保留抵抗侵略。保　領土之權利。…我國對和平解决國際爭　之篇信。竟未獲世界諒解尤可痛心　」誠哉其可痛心也且痛心我人民過於信仰和平不　奮其實力以從事於自衛其領土。自保其主權也。</p>
<p>我國人民素好和平。歴史傳統。由來已久。自淸末以至現今。事實彰明。無容贅述。雖我國現時陸軍兵員。總計超過二百萬。然而交通阻　。領土面積有三千四百餘萬方里。我國又非如日·法·諸國之用徴兵制度。隊常備而外。尙有後。備豫備各種兵役。可供調用。且近代科學兵器日進。舉凡空中飛機。陸行之坦克車。遼距離之列車砲等。在日内瓦軍縮會議上爭論不决者。日軍可任意用以殺戮我東北人民。而我中國則無此種設備更以海軍實力言。我國海軍。類皆三十年前之舊艦偶有新建造。其艦型奇小備砲亦僅限於保持該艦自身航行之安全。最大限度。不過用以防禦盜賊之襲繫。代理水上警察之職務而已。其絕無對外作戰之準備。已可槪見。是以我國保留「保障領土主</p>
<p>權之權利及抵抗侵略之自衛行動。」實最公平而適合於理性者也。</p>
<p>同時在日内瓦高倡軍縮之際。日本陸軍部對於華北軍事行動。乃有奇異聲明。誇耀其可於呼吸之間奪取平津。併又提出「如中國方面負責者。具誠意以臨交涉日方當不吝協間。…但日軍將仍駐現地。爲「和」與「戰」之兩樣。整備。…設使因中國方面之不誠意而致和議不成功。或以挑播行爲而惹起戰爭。其影響至大。想華方當局必充分考慮及之也。」嗚呼是何言哉。自瀋陽事變發生以來。其挑播衅端者。究竟誰屬勿待吾人之聲辯。即日本數十年之老友李頓爵士。亦已明白言之。内田之「焦土外交。」亦在另一方面。自行說明其武力政策。則日本所謂「誠意」之解釋。除軍部槍尖所指而外。别無其他。在此武力萬能公理泯没之時代。軍國主義者誠可任意横行。蔑棄信義而無所顧惜。然而後來之糾紛。則殊未可逆覩也。吾人爲自國前途計。爲世界和平計。第一須知國際爭端。勝負之數。非如個人利祿關係之可定决於俄傾。必賴相當時期之苦鬥與努力。乃可挽轉頽勢而自救。第二應不以遭受當前挫折面自餒。須知「三户可以亡秦／一旋可以中興。一况我國雖日趨削弱。儘多復興之機。要視我國民之努力何如耳。</p>
<p>總之軍備縮小。固吾人所衷心贊同。但須侵略者充分自省。而參與軍縮各友邦。又能以實際制裁專恃武力以爲侵略之工具者。則吾國自當竭盡其力以擁護和平。否則寗保留自徫衛領士之權以圖將來之所以自救也。</p>

<p>主席報告</p>
<p>主席陸京士報告、略謂、各位同志、今天是五卅慘案八週紀念、五卅慘案發生之遠因、即爲中國受不平等條約的束縳、他的近因、就是帝國主義相互勾結、而施於中國人民以空前的壓迫、但是五卅事件、雖有許多羣衆的犧牲、因爲國内軍閥的私鬥、終不能得到勝利、而軍閥的私鬥、都是以帝國主義作背景、帝國主義所以能慫恿軍閥私鬥、完全憑藉不平等條約、所以我們要脫離帝國主義的壓迫、祇有一致對外廢除不平等條約云云、</p>

<h3>俞鴻鈞談籌備自治</h3>
<p>緊縮係暫時稍紓財力</p>
<p>時局稍定　積極進行</p>
<p>中央社云、本市自治籌備委員會、自上星期經市政府二百三十六次市政會議議决、令飭緊縮後、一時外間不明眞相、頗多揣測、甚有謂此次緊縮、即係停辦者、言人人殊、莫衷一是、記者爲此事、特至市政府、訪晤俞秘書長、蒙接談甚詳、茲將俞氏談話錄後、各省市籌備地方自治、係爲訓政期中中央限辦之要政、本市地位特殊、觀瞻所繫、自十九年接奉中央命令、首先創設本市地方自治訓練所、俾養成鉅量自治專門人才、爲地方之用、一面並同時成立上海市政府劃分市區委員會、調查全市區界址、劃十三行政區爲四十自治區、積經年之功、將自治始基完成、此後　正擬繼續辦理户口調查、劃分坊閭鄰、以便進行自治職員各級選舉、不國一二八事變、適於其時發生、市府固定步驟、不得不暫告中輟、迨上年五月滬戰終止、協定告成、於是市府後於同年七月一日、組織上海市自治籌備委員會、將前劃區委員會未竟事項、由該會負責辦理、夫前劃區委員會所掌理者、僅劃區一項、係開自治籌備之始端、自治籌委會、負有全部籌備任務、其繁簡自不可同日而語、故組織一層、特爲稍稍充備、庶利進行、該會成立匝月、即將所有章制草擬呈報、並規定全部籌備、爲準備調查選舉三個時期、自上年七月一日一至本年六月三十一日、一年度中、完成本市自治籌備、成立各區民選區公所及市組織法各級自治機關、當上年七月、正本市一二八事變初定、地方創鉅痛深之際、市府於籌備地方善後蘇救不遑中、成立該會、賡續辦理地方自治籌備、其重視此事、不惜竭蹶以赴之、苦心可以想見、嗣因該會原陳計畫、係定上年八月三十一日前成立、各委任區公所其時因區長人選、市庫財力、均非咄嗟可辦、故遲至上年十二月、始將各委任區長、由内政部核委、呈報行政院備案乃由該會重爲規畫、决定自本年一月一日始、進行組織、各區委任區公所、將原定期限展緩半年、詎料事有意外、不旋踵而華北戰禍忽起、舉國因外侮日急、日常行政猶受影響、何况此上下屬望之自治要政、關係本市萬世基業、豈能於此國事蜩螗中草率從事者、此係事實使然、因不得不暫俟機進行、至上月中旬、市府因目前財力實或不繼、且時局影響、一時或未易恢復、適由該會呈請迅示辦法到府、乃提交第二百三十六次市政會議議决、暫令緊縮、一面呈請行政院核示、按緊縮目的、不過將會中經費縮减、稍紓財力、而自治籌備委員會依然存在、各委員仍將繼續孹畫、一方面靜候行政院指令辦理也、總之、市府對於迅速完成本市地方自治籌備、早具决心、觀於上年戰後之勉力成立自治籌備委員會、可見一斑、只須事實許可無不努力從事、若夫侈口空談、妄加臆測、則非所知矣、</p>

<h3>越界築路案將有新發展</h3>
<p>具體性質尙未明瞭</p>
<p>國聞社云、公共租界所築之越界築路、於去年迭經我市政府秘書長俞鴻鈞·與工部局總裁費信惇·交涉收回、已有解决之望、旋經日人方面阻撓、致該案延擱迄今、已半載有餘、最近方有續商之望、茲誌該案經過、及近訊如左、</p>
<p>交涉經過</p>
<p>市政府秘書長俞鴻鈞、秉承市府春行政院之意旨、與工部局總裁費信惇、秉承工部局董事會之意志、二氏往返磋商、意見頗見接近、並經起草協定草案、詳載越界築路收回之行政問題、經雙方分别向主管機關請示、行政院請得市政府所呈報之協定草案原文、訓令修改字句、俞秘書奉令後、復與費信惇洽商、工部局對我方修改字句、亦有容納之意、詎此時日人方面、卽以種種要挾、阻撓進行、以致無形延擱、</p>
<p>日方阻撓</p>
<p>日人方面之反對我國收回越界築路、初由日董寺井·岡本·二氏、於工部局董事會、持反對態度、然因各國董事多數贊成交回我國、故日董之反對、於董事會中、以絕對少數失敗、旋改由日駐滬總領石射豬太郎、與工部局交涉、由費信惇與石射往返磋商、歴時半年、中間我方與工部局之交涉、即無法進行、乃靜候工部局日領署二方之發展、考日方之阻撓方法、以公共租界越界築路之區、大部爲西北二區、而日人僑滬者之生命財產、俱在西北一區越界築路地段爲大本營、以爲交回市府管轄後、不信任日人之保障、故竭力反對收回、嗣因工部局交回我方之意甚切、交涉頗有眉目、協定草案即將成立、故由日領向工部局表示、日方欲保留警權、然此舉有關我國主權、工部局明知爲我方不能容納、故各就此點磋商、日人初頗堅持此議、嗣後要求設置日籍副警長、及添招日籍特别警務人員等、討論歷時半年、因工部局與日領署俱嚴守秘密之故、外間殊尠傳聞、卽有所聞、亦頗不詳、故關於收回越界築路之消息、報紙上已沉寂半年有餘、</p>
<p>最近發展</p>
<p>聞最近工部局與日領署之交涉、已有新發展、故工部局董事會、於前星期例會中、曾一度重提舊事、加以討論、同時有工部局將與我方繼續之訊、故已證實、日領署方面之讓步惟此項讓步之具體性質、究竟何若、因雙方仍守秘密之故、尙未明瞭、祇工部局將與我方績商之說、副任何方面、俱不否認耳、</p>
<h3>滬日間日輪不敷運貨</h3>
<p>國人抵貨無效</p>
<p>日人自嗚得意</p>

<h3>求學與投軍</h3>
<p>丨紹興周民安君來信丨</p>
<p>編輯先生··</p>
<p>我是個受經濟壓迫，環境支配而失學的靑年！我在兩年前，高小畢業，本來很想就入中學，可是，不能！家裏窮得生活都不能維持下去，那裏有錢求學呢？畢業後，又没有相當職業；於是，便天天遊蕩着，把那寳貴的光陰，一天一天的由遊蕩二字中消磨過去。我的母親，是個深謀遠慮的人，她以爲我這樣玩着，祇有消耗，没有收入；便命我往附近的山前山後，打柴；或替人家帮忙，討人家一餐飯也好，拿人家一角錢也行。却把學問無形中的荒廢了！我有時候雖然想忙裏偷閒去求些學問，可是，我的母親，她老人家竟吵着說我做事到懶惰，却是天天拿着書，有甚麽用呢？可憐我祇好放下書，去幹旁的事。有時候往山上去砍柴，偷偷地在柴筐底下藏幾本已讀過了的敎科書。把柴砍好了，山上坐着讀。等到天將黑了。才罷。這樣的日子，直到去年秋季；後來有人替我薦到上海一所小藥社做學徒。那知該店又因虧本而歇了業；於是，我便又失業回家了。現在呢？祇有仍從忙裏偷閒的每天閱閱（祇有最短期間）貴報外、（因爲我在救學時，當時學校裏也定有一份貴報；課後，我自命貴報是我唯一的伴侶；自從前年九一八事後，便和人家合定了一份貴報。）其餘的時間，爲了吃飯問題，總是替人家做苦工。但是，想求學的心却還没有死，有時在報看了各校招生廣告，幾乎使我傷心得落淚！又眼瞪瞪的看一般紈裿子弟們由小學而人中學！眞羨慕極了！我有時雖自已這樣想：他們也是人，我也是人，我又和他們在同一的社會上，怎麽他們有享受求學的福氣呢？唉！我……我怎麽連函授學校（如開明函授中學及其他等）都不能呢？就是自修吧！天旣不肯賜予我以自修的相當時間，自已又没有能力買普通的自修參考書籍。家裏有的除了從前讀過的幾本敎科書，和東西漢演義薛仁貴征東七俠五義英烈傳等的舊小說外，餘則别無所有！先生，像我處於這種環境之中，有甚麽方法可以求學呢？</p>
<p>又我以爲如果眞的没有求學的機會了，那我已是世界上最可憐的人了！我還有甚麽做人的趣味呢？不如自殺吧？可是，現在國難當頭，自殺不如投軍！况且現在敵人已打進我們河北了，平津又在危急着。投軍北上，爲國而死，總比自殺有價値些！先生，你道投軍可以嗎？請先生以宏博的高才，豐富的經騐，替在下在貴欄内解决這以上的兩個問題。</p>
<p>覆函明日登出</p>
<p>頃有紹興何懼君來信，謂曾以數載之力，耗無限心血，根據學理，發明熱水瓶一種，能保熱十日，保冷一月，其功效遠過市上所售任何熱水瓶之上。惟因缺乏資本，不能自行設廠製造，擬徵求國内實業家合作，或將發明權出售。囑本報代爲介紹。本報以何君有此發明，若不令行世，殊屬可惜，特樂爲登報介紹如上。如國内實業家有意於此，可逕函紹興東關何君接洽可也。</p>

<p>自我國民政府於五月二十二日實行新關稅法，提高關稅率以後，反對最烈者，厥惟日本商人，而以業棉布者爲尤甚。連日召集各埠日商，開會研究對策，甚至竟誣爲變相抵制日貨之辦法，認爲日本貨物，在世界市塲，目前均無伸展之餘地，僅此中國之一條生路，斷斷不可放鬆，提出議案八條，欲向我政府抗議，中有此種稅率，若不修改，不但棉紗商要受打擊，凡屬在華日本工商業，受此影響，結果日本之對華貿易，將從此衰退。此問題比上年之滬變更嚴重，解决不得其法，或將發生可怕的事變。同時呼籲日政府及日本棉紗布出口同業公會，大阪棉布商同業會，予以同樣之援助。慣用槍桿做生意之日人，明明知中國有關稅獨立之主權，在法律上無抗爭之根據，偏欲藉武力　恫嚇，求不正當之解决，東開會，西商議，無理取閙，擴大其無謂之運動，有吉公使向我提出抗議書，有「貴國提高關稅，於日本貿易，打擊甚大，有害中日友交關係，甚爲遺憾，敬求反省。」參加世界經濟會議之日代表石井，指中國之抵制，爲商業上最大障礙，將在經濟大會提出應付計畫，日本上下，對我國早已視爲無物而無所畏懼，所畏懼者，此抵貨問題耳。有日本商人則無中國商人，日貨之利，卽國貨之害，大此生死關頭，奈何我國貨商人，獨不聞不問，漠然無動於中，一任日人出其鬼蜮之伎倆，以摧殘吾奄奄一息之國貨生機。謂吾不信，請言最近誣陷國貨商之事實。本月二十四日上海某日報，大書「上海事變發源之某社突然購動日紗抵制日貨漸見終熄」之標題中有「黄郛入北平而停戰協定將成立，抵制日貨，亦見緩和，前途大可樂觀，自天津帮以及靑島帮秦皇島帮，與本埠商界，雖因滿洲事變以來，尙在抵貨聲中，而近來對日紗日布，漸見購動，最足使人注目者，爲國民黨色彩最濃厚而誘發上海事變直接原因之某社，亦有購動日紗之傳聞，此抵貨之首領，已對日紗獻媚，則上海之抵貨運動，似可終熄」云云。日人明明知某社在杭州自設紗廠，自紡自織，無待外求，所以不惜造此荒謬無稽之蜚語，其目的（一）以誘惑世人之視聽，欺騙無知之華商，以堅其購用日貨之心理，以爲抵貨之首領，已無抵制之勇氣，則此外工廠商號，儘可購動。（二）日本在華商業打擊最重者，無過於棉布業，推原其始，則自民元某社創設以後，棉布工廠風發雲湧，足以抵制日貨於無形，最爲日人所嫉視，故一則曰國民黨色彩最濃厚，再則日抵貨之首領，極盡中傷排斥之能事，兇狠惡毒，無非欲制我國國貨商於死命。正兵奇兵，雙方並進，而我國貨商人，除該社自行與該新聞社交涉外，竟不聞不問一任日人之施其奸計，無所援助無所表示乎；我以爲今日國貨商應下最大决心，堅壁淸野，厲行下列各事，以自救救國。</p>
<p>（一）一致擁護新關稅，向政府表示，絲毫不可損喪關稅之自主權。</p>
<p>（二）自動組織檢查機關，相互檢舉，無使日貨有所蒙混，以損害國貨之發展。亦不使日人有所誣陷，以中傷純粹之國貨商。</p>
<p>（三）注意郵件運送，聞最近日貨侵入内地，多用郵包，聞均由南翔等處寄遞，而長江一帶之外國商輪，多有自辦郵政者。此中倫運，何可勝計。</p>
<p>（四）嗚呼，抗日無力，協定垂成，國運至此，全國痛心，苟我國貨商併此决心而無之，一任日人駡我爲利慾盲目之中國商人，（每日新聞語）則國貨界之生命，卽在此國貨年中壽終正寢，斯眞令人痛哭流涕而長太息也。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>定力</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>「定力」這二字，原是出於佛敎的，他的意思，是先由專門的思想而再持以堅定的决心，這就呌做「定力」，站在新時代上的人們，看了我的這幾句話，要說我是陳腐，那麽我當然是不會承認的，因爲我們大一些來說，上至國家大事，下至家庭瑣屑，莫不有至大的道理存乎這「定力」二字之間，現在政治的混亂，外交的屈辱；以及家庭間紛擾，這原由，却都是負重大責任的人，缺乏了定力之故·</p>
<p>我們具了堅决的意志，去實行某種事情，雖然是不能即刻成功，但是有這樣的决心，就是中間稍微有些挫折，將來的成功，是可必的，假使你在稍微受到挫折的時候，就以爲「前途茫茫，没有希望」而灰心，甚至半途中止，那麽你的失望，會比你没有實行某事，還要苦痛到千萬倍·</p>
<p>國家大事，我們且不必隢舌，現在所要說的，却是當前最大的責任，是關於國貨方面的事，我根本反對「中國人提倡中國貨」這句話，你想一個國家的人，當然要購用他自已國家的出品，使金錢不至流溢出外，這是天經地義的，可是在我們中國，就不能講這句話，自從海禁開後，外國貨成千成萬的裝箱來華，好奇的中國人，趨之苦鶩，積了近百年的悠久歷史，纔造成了現在的局面，「外貨暢銷，國貨遲滯」·一般國貨廠商，與熱心志士，競唱「提倡國貨」的口號，記得民四，日人壓迫袁世凱簽訂二十一條之後，我也曾和朋友組織救國十人團，宣傳着抵制仇貨，那時候，我也就根本反對「偍倡國貨」的「提倡」二字，與其要說是「偍倡」不如說「實用」來得確切些，因爲「偍倡」，是個抽象的名詞，你提倡也好，不提倡也好，講到「實用」二字，你非實用不可，似乎比提倡來得確切些，</p>
<p>再來說「定力」二字，在淸末的時候，乂貨鐵錨牌毛巾，不是市上很流行麽？民初的時候，上海乂乂實業社，鍳於它們的毛巾，在市上這樣的暢銷，就實行的抵制，出一種比較鐵錨牌質料好的毛巾來抵制，果然不到一年，乂貨大受影響，竟至不支，而自絕跡，乂貨還有一種雙貓牌火柴，也曾瘋狂在中華市塲，後來中國的乂乂廠，出貨抵制，也就和鐵錨牌毛巾一樣，受了厄運，單就這兩種日用品而論，在現在的中華市傷上，還有乂貨的仇跡嗎？我想無論如何，都不會再有發現了。</p>
<p>中國乂乂實業社的毛巾與乂乂廠的火柴，爲什麽竟有這樣驚人的異蹟？歸根一句，没有别的，就是他們依據了「定力」去實行的好處。</p>
<p>要知道一件事業的成功，不是很簡單的，曾文正公這樣說過「莫問將來收穫，但問現在耕耘」，收穫是將來的事，不能看到的；耕耘是現在的事，自否勤力，自否耐苦？如其依據定力做去，一絲不懈，是總能達到成功的目的。</p>
<p>關於生產者，需要「定力」有如此的緊要，那麽我們一般消費者，就可隨隨便便一無定力嗎？不然不然，消費者的需要「定力」，也和生產者一樣，你假如隨隨便便的去購買，不是生產者的一個大大阻碍碼？一般的消費者啊！第一要認淸「我們的時代」！第二要負起「我們的責任」！最後就是要把它聯貫起來，呵成一氣，大家來「實行服用國貨」！自</p>
<p>今日起，一直向前這樣切實做去，弗再回過頭來膽望；因爲一瞻望時，會使你前功盡去·丨民四到現在，已有不少絕好的借鏡，這個事實的功效，都是在「定力」二字上　出發的。</p>
<h3>勞働家與資本家</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>現在：絲廠是大衆都知道慘敗了。可是：勞工最多。規模最大的紗廠。又被奸商爲虎作倀，向中國内地傾銷的惡魔丨日紗丨搖動，再加以政府不急行傾銷稅，不减低統稅率和運價。不獎勵植棉，紗廠終於被迫减工，而走向没落之路，數十萬的勞動家生活，漸漸的倒懸起來！唉！多事的五月，我們希望勞動家，要和資本家站在一條戰線上，努力奮鬥，打出一條光明之路，資本家正在苦心計劃，維持你們的生活，誠能勞資合力的抵抗外來侵略，要堅結像鋼骨和水門汀，則中國市塲是中國的，勞働家是國貨的基本隊伍，將來打倒外貨，勞働家就格外有功，而値得大家稱頌了。</p>
<h3>紗廠之减工問題</h3>
<p>— 邱光庭</p>
<p>勞工，工廠僱用之以營生產也，工廠，勞工以勞力換金錢資以生活之所也。工廠賴勞工之力以成其生產，勞工賴工廠生產之所獲以供其生活，勞工不盡其力之所能從事生產，則生產量薄，成品價昂，不可與生產優厚之廠較，而業務趨於衰弛。欲生產進於優厚，則必多僱勞工，勞工人數增，而成品每件工資有定，每人工資必因總人數之增加而減少，工資少，在勞工個人生活固難寬裕，在工廠以須維持個人最低限度生活，必予以相當資給，總其工資所費，恒溢出每件標準工資以外，而較人數少賃率高者爲多。自合理化工作倡行於各工業先進國後，均以節縮消費增加生產爲鵠，羣思竭所能以赴之，於工程之繁複者簡單之，使得以最少努力發揮最大生產，於消費之空費者袪除之，使動力人力節縮。至於極度，於是勞力之所需愈减，需用勞工之數亦愈少，老廠欲同其步趨，免受淘汰，晚近所以有裁汰工人之舉。惟是年來生活程度邁進靡已，工資不增，勞工不能得良善生活，工資增，人數不减，則工資增益其數，成品必因消費加大而不易銷售，又非工廠所能勝其負担。欲求兩全，則惟有發揮勞工本能，减少人數，勞工能竭其能，以一人之力成兼人之事功，工廠高其資給，獎掖其能，在勞工因可能樂於其業，工廠亦可因人數减人，節縮二資之支給。</p>
<p>即以紡織廠而言，全國共有紗錠四百餘萬枚，屬於國人自營者計二百四十餘萬錠，日人經營者一百八十萬錠人，吾以稅制不良，不足保護國人自營之廠，使之致於繁榮，社會組織不健全，不能相與維繫，使紡　業趨於發展，政治不安定，人心浮動，胥爲紡織業不能發揚光大之直接間接原因，而勞工人數之多，工資支給之大，尤違生產合理化原則，不可與在華日廠較，日廠自淸棉至細紡，每萬錠平均須勞工一百四十人，上海華廠須二百二十人，合搖紗保全等工計之，日廠約二百五十人，上海華廠約三百十人，南通某廠萬錠平均，所用勞工數逾八百，近因農村經濟崩潰，購買力弱，加以日貨傾銷，以致各廠存貨量鉅，華商紗廠聯合會因有减少工作，以减少存積，一面整理内部，節縮過度消費，减輕成本之决議，庶不爲彼傾銷政策所逞，而尚有以自存，通廠因時代要求，甫有實現决議之籌劃，而勞工已本率罷工，一時衆議紛紜，有以不顧勞工生計爲言者，不知某廠之裁减工人，實求自身生存，兼以發揮不裁者之本能，而增進其利益也。夫天之降才，固無殊異，惟在善用之耳，善用其才，則愈用而愈著其能，不善用之，則怠惰成性，多又何益。日廠萬錠僅需勞工二百五十人，滬廠須三百人，而謂通廠萬錠勞工八百人之不可裁減，毌亦養成怠惰之習，使之成爲人世之廢人乎。</p>
<h3>國貨運動的成績在那裏</h3>
<p>— 蓮如</p>
<p>雖然有一般人爲了愛國心的衝動，便熱烈的提倡着國貨，但到底有不少喚不醒來的行屍走肉的亡國同胞，不，冷血動物；只要你到街上去統計，不需十分鐘，包管給你一個驚人的數目，穿着洋貨的人，佔十分之九，尤其是自認爲國家中堅份子的靑年。</p>
<p>時間的進展，是留不住的，國貨年也已怱怱的過了五個多月，但國貨推銷的成績怎樣了？洋貨的進口又减少了幾何？這是痛心的事；請看最近海關的報告：</p>
<p>本年三月份入超國幣一○一·七四七·四二○元</p>
<p>去年一月至三月入超國幣一八五·三六四·八六二元</p>
<p>今年一月至三月入超國幣　二○四·五三二·七七○元</p>
<p>在國貨年中，在國家破亡的的日子，祗三個月的時間，已有二萬萬零四百五十萬餘元的入超，照這樣推算到全年，則本年度須流到國外的金錢有八萬萬一千八百十三萬餘元；以此來購飛機，以每架十五萬元來計算，則可購五千四百五十四架。</p>
<p>據各方面之調查，其最大的原因由於一般人樂用洋貨衣料，但是大多數的人，一般要人和他那的姨太太，資本家和社會的商賈，學校的敎師和學生，究竟已否覺悟，還得自已檢點一下。</p>
<p>最後我以個人的熱忱，來請求大人們先生們服用國貨，把我的推算打消，不要再空唱高調，來實行眞正的救國工作，丨提倡國貨，不然的話，還是等着日本兵來時做亡國奴吧！</p>
<h3>我國製造炭酸鈣事業之調查（下）</h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>工業原料調查</p>
<p>（二）大中華製鈣廠　大中華製鈣廠，可算是大中華橡膠廠的附屬事業，廠赴在徐家匯路，資本由十萬元而增至十五萬元，經理薛福基君，曾在日本經商有年，對於化學工業，很有經騐，經理朱渭臣，辦事也很精明果敢。薛福基同時又兼任着大中華橡膠廠的經理，所以對於出品方面，是常有自已檢查和實騐的機會。現在該廠所出的雙錢牌炭酸鈣，色澤潔白，成份也還純淨。該廠的製造方法，是將整個的日本輸入中國，如今總算是達到「成功」兩字了！該廠的產量，每日能出品三百包，（每包裝一百十二磅）重量是三萬多磅。大部份是供給大中華橡膠廠之用，市上行銷的仍是不多。</p>
<p>（三）新業化工廠　新業化工廠，廠址在日暉港兆豐路，另設發行處於牛莊路六九二號，該廠的出產，大部份是供給義生橡膠廠之用，董事長馮蓮生，便是義生橡膠廠的大股東。經理陳筱坪，曾在美孚行任職十餘年，爲人很精明幹練。該廠的製造方法，是倣日本式而參以西歐式，但現在可說是尙未完全成功。該廠的產量，現在每日可出七八十包，（每包重五十磅）重量約四千磅。除供義生廠製套鞋之用外，市上銷行的很少。但據該廠負責人的意見，是預備在添購機器，以謀產額的增加了。</p>
<p>除了以上三廠外，在浙江，湖州，還有一家大利華製鈣廠，在天津有一家渤海化學廠，可是規模並不很大，所以產額也不多。在這　，因爲篇幅的關係，恕不詳述了。</p>
<p>至於日貨在我國行銷的炭酸鈣，因爲𡳞有三分之一的石灰，所以售價低廉，現在還有許多不明化學檢查的廠家，貪圖便宜，在那裏飲酖止渴！據最近的調查，日貨炭酸鈣在華的銷額，每月仍有四五千包之多，佔國貨全部產額約四分之一，這一筆漏巵，一方面是希望我國製鈣廠的繼續努力！一方面尢其希望購買仇貨的工廠，趕快自已覺悟，一致改用本國貨！</p>

<p>貢献意見</p>
<h3>貢獻於國貨公司者</h3>
<p>— 頌唐</p>
<p>中國國貨公司創立以來，轉瞬數月，營業蒸蒸日上，足徵國人愛國心重，可欣可慰。然耳聞目見，尙有未盡善者，眞似骨梗在喉，欲吐爲快，不侫服務國貨工廠，更屬唇齒相關，不得不掬誠奉告：</p>
<p>（一）售價問題　無論何人，一面雖認明國貨，服用國貨，若同式同樣之國貨，而售價高低不同，當然同廉價者購之，此種情形，普通商店尚不以爲奇，同一出品而價格或有高下，此大爲惋惜者也。萬一有此，在顧客之損失尙屬有限，而國發公司之信譽實大有影響。在蒞臨之顧客，均慕名而來，早抱信任心理，購物出門，日見街頭店舖中之同式產品，售價較低，豈不大失所望？欲求營業之接踵再來，其可得乎。在公司方面或因貨品名目繁多，事務粟碌，不及一一細辨之故，國貨公司之標定售價，確係得値注意之事，應當隨時調查市塲上各店售價相比較，再計算進價之若何，因各店可賣者，公司無一不能。如能較低更佳，至少限度亦當依市上各舖之最低價爲標準。</p>
<p>（二）貨品陳列　國貨公司之貨品陳列，零亂不齊，雖云營業繁忙之故，頂好隨時翻閱，即行摺疊整理，養成習慣以後，在觀瞻方面生色不少。且於顧客選擇貨品時，易於應付，即點存貨品，亦省却許多手續，以免浪費時間。</p>
<p>（三）服裝整潔　至於接近顧客之櫃員練習生，除應行遵守之禮貌態度外，對於服裝，不求質之高貴，但求整齊潔淨，亦屬各個應當注意者也。</p>
<p>（四）膳鐘改造　友人某君云，某日午時往國貨公司購辦零物，忽聞鈐聲大振，顧客莫名何故，均現驚惶之狀，詢悉膳食鐘耳，如三公司用八音鐵板，繞道一週，其聲已雅，而電費及裝置等工程亦可省便。目下南部正在擴充中。當可設法改變。</p>
<p>（五）減價問題　减價方式，爲晚近滬上商店公司唯一吸引顧客之法，然整個偉大之中國國貨公司，應有一定之時期，不宜多行减價，抱定寗可價廉，毌多减價之志，免失信仰力也。</p>
<p>他若品質之純粹，整潔，包扎動作之敏捷，收欵手續之迅速與正確，尤爲顧客所希望，而公司當局應加注意者也。</p>
<p>國貨介紹</p>
<h3>介紹國貨流動團</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>在這國貨年中，在上海的表面上，似乎轟轟烈烈，盛極一時，可是大家的目標，似乎都集中於幾個大都市，而最多數的消費者之各地鄕村，反没有顧到。諸位試到鄕村去看看，那欹斜的牆壁上，破敝的籬落間，隨處都是仇貨的廣告，而國貨的宣傳品，反而找不到，眼看仇貨的輸入，源源不絕，鄕村農民服用的棉織品和日用品，屬於仇貨的，要佔到百分之八十以上，這是何等痛心的事。</p>
<p>最近上海有幾位熱心國貨的人士，在中華國貨產銷合作協會指導之下，發起了一個中華國貨流動推銷團，利用船隻車輛，陳列國貨樣品，游行於市鎭鄕村，使國貨暢銷内地。深入民間。現在用了兩隻商船，正向嘉定南翔太倉崑山常熟各處鄕村市鎭次第進行，船上備有最新式的無線電收音機。在行駛或到達某地時，隨時放音，以吸引當地人民的觀聽，商船每到一地，便分發請柬，遍邀當地各界人士及商界領袖到船參觀，欵以茶點，以誘致愛用國貨者之購買慾。推銷步驟，先從調查入手，凡新航行線第一次前往試銷時，每抵一地，推銷員便分赴各商店，調查該處暢銷各貨及其價格記入，以便查考。並請各商店負責人員到船參觀貨樣，欵以茶點，以資聯絡。同時進行現貨及定貨交易。他們决心抛却都會的市塲，儘讓别位同志去做，而他們則專心致力鄕村的宣傅和推銷，把國貨深入民間，使他們對於國貨能淸晰的辨識，更深切了能購用國貨的意義，廠方對於國貨的出品，也力求適合於顧客的需要條件。該團是介居於廠方和顧客的中間，使產銷雙方聲息相通。都得到十分滿意，漸漸達成杜絕一切外貨的願望，該團負着這重大的使命，我樂爲提出介紹的。</p>
<h3>你是那一國人</h3>
<p>— 俞洽成</p>
<p>兒童世界</p>
<p>春天的黄昏，帶着初夏的暖意，西曬的太陽更打進普益社的幼稚園，這一幕已經是舊聞了，但是印象仍舊是很新。</p>
<p>演說，是關於敎育方面的；討論，是關於家庭方面的。老敎育家黄任之，他總不願使那許多隨着姆媽來的小寳寳寂寞，所以有十五分鐘的兒童談話，做了一次有意義有價値而且有趣味的兒童</p>
<h3>兒童國貨歌</h3>
<p>— 難公</p>
<p>好哥哥，小弟弟。互相勉勵，一致奮起！用國貨，穿布衣！旣堅固，又經濟！大家要牢記。</p>
<p>國貨運動。諸位欲知詳情如何，且待在下用記叙式的戲劇用來表明！</p>
<p>時間：一個春天的黄昏</p>
<p>地點：普益社幼稚園</p>
<p>人物：兩排矮橙圍成一個圈子，前排有三十幾個孩子，後排有五十幾個主婦（也許有幾位候補主婦的女士），黄先生站在房子的一端。</p>
<p>幕開時，黄先生已講過「怎樣做父母」。</p>
<p>黄：我現在要拿十五分鐘的時候，和小朋友談談，好嗎？</p>
<p>衆孩：（有的放下了糖果，有的抬起了疲乏的頭，都振作起來，聽候談話的開展。）</p>
<p>黄：你們是那一國人？</p>
<p>衆孩：中國人！</p>
<p>黄：現在中國是强呢？還是弱？</p>
<p>甲：不怎麽强！</p>
<p>黄：中國爲什麽弱的？恐怕你們還不明白我告訴你們，原因雖然很多，中國人不喜歡用中國貨，錢被人家弄去，也是一個很大的原因。</p>
<p>衆孩：（靜默了些時）</p>
<p>黄：去年上海閘北打伏，隆隆的大砲，你們忘記了吧？</p>
<p>衆孩：没有！</p>
<p>黄：那一國人來打我們？</p>
<p>甲孩：東洋人。</p>
<p>黄：他們爲什麽打我們的？</p>
<p>甲孩：因爲我們不買東洋貨。</p>
<p>黄：他們爲什麽要我們買東洋貨？我告訴你們，他們用東洋貨來換我們的錢，使我們窮，他們富，使我們弱，他們强，然後使我們從貧弱而亡國。</p>
<p>衆孩：（再靜默了些時）</p>
<p>黄：你們喜歡那一國的貨？</p>
<p>衆孩：中國貨。</p>
<p>黄：你們爲什麽喜歡中國貨？</p>
<p>衆孩：因爲我們是中國人！</p>
<p>黄：好，小朋友，中國人用中國貨！自後，我們無論衣食住行，多用國貨，國家才可富强，大家才可以不做亡國奴！</p>
<p>衆孩：（一致的呼聲）我們用中國貨！</p>
<p>作者附註：這是事實，因爲有異於一般的紀錄，而且未曾有機會請黄任之先生修正，所以辭句中有未盡善的地方，當然由作者負責。</p>
<h3>弟弟的來信</h3>
<p>— 朱山秀</p>
<p>我每天度了刻板式的工作之後，總歡喜拿我的小弟弟的照片玩玩，或拿他的來信看看；雖然照片不會說話，來信似通非通，但總能消滅我的煩悶於無形。今天照例又是翻看着他上星期給我的信，鄰座的同學李君說：「快去拿罷，你的弟弟又有信來了。還有舊的做什麽？」我立起來預備去拿，門房却已送了進來，拆開來一看，上面是顏體的小楷，幼稚的詞句，整整的寫了兩幅：</p>
<p>秀兄：</p>
<p>又一星期不請安了，掛念得很。我們這幾天眞忙得不得了，敎我們體育的趙先生，帶着我們到各鄕鎭茶店裏去演講服用外貨的害處，我我喉嚨，雖已有些嘶啞，可是，我絲毫不覺得苦惱，反而心中覺得非常愉快；因爲許多人都能被我們感動，點着頭表示附和。我們就藉此組織了一個念二社，這是趙先生定的名辭。社裏訂了許多規約：（一）服用土貨。（二）不吸香烟。（三）不穿西裝。（四）不敷脂粉。規約雖然很嚴，加入的人却不少，他們都宣誓願終身力行。秀兄：你總嫌惡鄕人的無知，上一趟城，定要帶些紅紅綠綠的洋貨回去。現在他們覺悟了，你也可不嫌惡他們了罷？我覺他們個個都是可親的，他們也似乎對我很親熱。誰說中國人心已死了呢？我們現在除自身做人家的模範外，仍繼續的在課餘向鄕人勸告，希望有一天會使虚僞的外貨絕跡。秀兄：我很希望你也能集合同志組織起求。</p>
<p>宣傳隊又要出發了，再會罷。</p>
<p>你的親愛的弟弟西農</p>
<p>我看完了這封信，簡直使我忘記了腹中的飢鳴。他是一個多麽可愛的安琪兒！我還記得他在六歳時，看見鄰家的普生玩着外貨的洋囡囡，他也閙着要買，不得已，買了一個給他，他歡天喜地的抛了他的茅山喇叭，和洋囡囡做朋友了；不多時，不意跌了一交，他的洋囡囡也被壓扁了。他非常懊惱，我的父親說：「這是不經用的外貨，你還要嗎。」他很快的拾了抛棄的茅山喇叭，掉頭不顧的没看牠丨洋囡囡丨一眼。此後，他聽到洋貨二字，總現出鄙屑的神情，還常常告戒他的小朋友不要買洋貨。這事離現在已七年了。他那知道我們早已有了念二社的組織，念二社的名辭又那裏是他們趙先生定的。可是，他那懇摰的態度，充滿在他的詞句之中。我的愛他，實也就在這一點上。</p>
<p>同胞們，當你看完了這雖不甚通順的短信，總應有所感動罷。</p>
<h3>小問答一束</h3>
<p>— 宜菊</p>
<p>問：爲什麽我們要用國貨呢？</p>
<p>答：因爲我們是中國人，所以要用國貨。</p>
<p>問：國貨未必如外貨那樣使人滿意吧？</p>
<p>答：不錯，國貨固有不如外貨的地方，但是就耐用一層講，外貨就比較要遜色得多了，况且，最近國貨，都逐漸地在改良進步，將來總有能和外貨作並駕齊驅的一日，這是在我們預料中的。</p>
<p>問：有幾樣東西，國貨是没有的，這怎講呢？</p>
<p>答：有國貨，用國貨，無國貨，用國貨代用品，卽使價格稍高，亦應咬定牙根，忍痛一時。</p>
<p>問：實在没有，那怎麽辦呢？</p>
<p>答：可以不用，勉强把它省去，實在不能省却的時候，只好去買外貨，只是我們要認淸，我們目前最大的敵人丨日本。他們的貨品，無論如何，必不可去買用，這是要記牢的。</p>
<p>問：國民都能買用國貨，果是有助於國家的嗎？</p>
<p>答：當然，這是絕對不能懷欵的！我相信，如果國人都能一心買用國貨，堅决意志，不出三年，一定可收絕大的功效，這要看國人如何努力了！</p>
<p>問：用了國貨，就算了嗎？丨還應怎樣呢？</p>
<p>答：用國發滿意時，應向親友間廣宣傳其優點，勸令試用，較之廣告效力，高出萬倍，久後必將外貨擠出市場，不滿意時，應向出品廠家指摘其劣點，督促改良，庶使貨身抬高，行銷無阻，這是我們國民應有　　的態度，亦都是表示我們國民提倡國貨的熱心程度。</p>
<p>問：提倡國貨應從何處　起？</p>
<p>答：先從本身，家庭，而後推及親戚好友。</p>
<p>問：謝謝你，承你指點許多良意，使我異常感激。</p>
<p>答：這是不必說的，我卽是在提倡國貨呢！</p>
<h3>無錫的一種國貨時裝</h3>
<p>— 朱山秀</p>
<p>在無錫丨小上海的無錫丨你的鼓膜能不斷地被雄偉的汽笛聲所振動，這種聲音大半是從紗布廠中所發出的，這樣似乎無錫一般人的服裝應是舶來品絕跡了，可是，事實不像我們所想像的，當我們走到街上時，那種奇異的服色丨尤其是西裝丨也不斷地剌進你的眼簾，使你想到國貨的前途丨這實是非常痛心的一回事。所幸現在已有一件差强人意的消息，我來把牠介紹一下；</p>
<p>一般西裝少年中一部份尙有血性者，他們都自承過去的罪惡，他們說他們每人每年爲服裝至少流出國幣七八十元，現在已立志服用國貨了。所以最近在街上可以看見上身士林布襯衫下身黄斜紋布西裝褲丨布料是採申新慶豐廣勤等廠之出品，内穿五和廠的衛生衫，脚穿兄弟公司之籃球鞋之靑年，三三兩兩的來往著。已冷了的熱度復高了。本來，用國貨最好也用國裝式樣，可是，要原諒他們，他們已習於西服，要聚然轉變過來，不是頃刻的事。總之，這種國貨時裝的舉動，未始不是國貨界前途的一線曙光；退一步講，也總聊勝於無了。</p>
<p>簡訊　紹鼎秉鉞二先生鑒：加減秉除計算機製造處，在靜安寺路哈同路口一四四七號，該機以正在改進製造之中，故尙未定價格也。（編者）</p>
<h3>對於國貨工廠的願望</h3>
<p>— 許難公</p>
<p>國貨提倡了許多年，洋貨的充斥於市塲依我然有增無减，每年海關統計入超額的數量，祇有上漲而没有絲毫的低落，其所以如此者是否國貨生產缺乏，或因價昂質劣所致，但我們試到各處國貨市場去觀察，其内部陳列的各種貨品，如綢緞布疋，家庭用品，呢絨織物，一切的用具，其質料的優越，售價的低廉，雖未必盡滿人意，但足與舶來品相抗，故其癓結不在於生產而在乎服用的不廣，所以不廣的原因，是製造廠推銷的不力，没有團結的精神，是爲不可否認的事實。</p>
<p>在過去製造廠大都侷促一隅，不事對外發展，因此合許多同業於一處，爲利害的關係而引起互相傾軋，將全部精力用之於同業間的明爭暗奪，無暇顧及對外，此種弊病足以分散力量，因内部暗鬥不休而洋貨乘機侵入，所以國貨的不能普遍，雖有種種原因的阻碍，但製造廠應負相當責任。</p>
<p>所以我們見到過去的訛誤而要矯正於未來，移同業爭鬥的精力於對外擴展，實爲國貨工廠的急切需要。因缺少向外推展而致人民無從認識，雖欲採購也因不知國貨的有無出產，甚至被奸商以改頭換面所曚蔽，因此現在的國貨工廠，除了出品的精益求精之外，尤其需要的是力事宣傅，如組織國貨集團，分赴各地展覽，使民衆得以認識，多立門市零售，予購買者的便利，不致蒙受奸商欺騙，須謀產銷連成一氣相輔而行，使國貨川流不息而得以暢行全國。</p>
<p>當此提倡國貨的呼聲，彌漫於全國的時期，深願我們的國貨工廠，要掉轉方向從闊的路上走，深入内地去推銷，尋覓吾們的廣大市場，不要儘在牛角尖裏互相火进！</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>風</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>蓋聞牢騷跡近反動、理合不宜多發；風月有點腐化，此事也要當心。西薈初年，八王大動干戈，閙得天翻地覆；劉曜石勒一聲呼嘯，十入洛陽。把晉書翻開一薈，看史家有什麽褒貶？阿呀！朝廷原來普無過失，禍魁都在王（弼）何（宴）身上。王何提倡淸談，好談風月，就咬定他們「遂令仁義幽淪，儒雅蒙　，禮壤樂崩，中原傾　。」將來史臣咬定熱河失守，平津危急，都是自由談編者多談風月之故，要明正典刑以伸國法，看你如何辦法！還有一個談風月的名手丨王夷甫，大家咬定西晉之亡，都是他的「口過」；石勒捉住他，申叙他的罪狀；「亂天下者此人也！」將來王師南下，萬民歸順，聖王要正兩觀之誅，自由談記者且無所逃罪於天下，所以多談風月，竊期期以爲不可！</p>
<p>然則不談「風月」，單獨談「風」可乎？翻開詩經一看，啊呀丨更不得了！詩大序云；「風，風也。…上以風化下，下以風上，主文而蹫諫，言之者無罪，聞之者足以戒，故曰風。」辱在下民，只能以風剌上；只怕頭不高興，心中的話，彎彎曲曲說了一些，拼命在主文而譎諫上做工夫；結果仍是言之者有罪，聞之者不戒。還惹得正統派思想家大大不高興，說「以風剌上」，「主文譎諫」的這樣那樣不光明磊落，這樣那樣要不得，牙癢癢地想咬一口才痛快。所以單獨談「風」，余有戒心。</p>
<p>並且「風」之一字，還有别一含義。費誓；「馬牛其風」，左傳：「風馬牛不相及」，服虔注；「牝牡相誘謂之風。」廣雅及釋名釋「風，放也。」漢書藝文志注；「放，蕩也。」說「牝牡相誘」，說「放」，說「蕩」，都有淫蕩莽放之含義；方令廉恥之敎，著於令册，風化修關，决不容檢蕩逾閑；「風」之不可談者又如此。</p>
<p>或曰：「南風之薰」「仁風廣被」，「風調雨順」，吉祥之字甚多，何不頌堯舜之聖明，贊文武之仁政？奚以風剌爲也？曹子曰：「唯唯，吾將頌之矣：」詩曰：</p>
<p>「北風其喈，雨雪其霏：惠而好我，携手同歸，其虚其邪，旣亟只且！</p>
<p>莫赤匪狐，莫黑匪烏，惠而好我，携手同車，其虚其邪，旣亟只且！」</p>
<p>（詩北風）</p>
<h3>解僱</h3>
<p>— 彭雪珍</p>
<p>這天早上，榮子出去了不多時便愁眉苦臉地轉回來。</p>
<p>母親在門檻上補綴衣裳，瞧着榮子進們，心裏一跳，差點兒没拿針剌破了指頭。</p>
<p>「怎麽，眞的不能織下去了嗎？」</p>
<p>「早對你說了，去年一塊多錢一担的參葉，賣出去的繭子三十塊錢一担，賣的人心痛，去掉種子人工錢餘不了什麽：可是絲廠裏是織了綢緞賣不出去，大家愛穿洋貨。」</p>
<p>「三姑父那機房就關門了嗎了？」</p>
<p>「這幾年來關了門的可不是不少了？全是什麽人造絲惹出的亂子。」</p>
<p>榮子想起了三姑父那副苦臉：</p>
<p>「今天没有絲了，我這機房從此停工。」</p>
<p>「你又發老病了，我已聽你說過十回？」</p>
<p>「這回可是眞的，我听有的幾塊錢都賠完了，織出來的賣不出去，鴻昇綢緞廠不收了。說東洋人在哪塊跟咱們打仗，運不出去，百姓又窮。」</p>
<p>「可是穿洋貨就不窮了哪！這，咱們可吃什麽？一榮子可眞急了，直瞪着眼。</p>
<p>「問你呀，我想回鄕下，可是田呢，一樣的連還租都不夠，咱們村裏人去年有幾個夠吃來着？」老頭兒的聲音也低了。</p>
<p>榮子還記起五六個向伴埀頭喪氣地打機房裏出來的情景：不再有軋軋的噪音了，那黑黝黝的小屋，那低凹的泥土和破舊的　大的木機，一切都像冬天的陽光般地使人依戀，就連那一陳陳霉臭味，今天都怪　韾的。</p>
<p>然而大家是默默地走了，留下那過雨大也計會被三姑父礕了當柴燒的木機。二姑父茫然地撫着胸脯在門前望着。</p>
<p>一天可眞是不容咱們活下去了似的　秀媽，明天可　　吃底？</p>
<p>女人　開褥子，　板北　　　　們　　的四九十個銅子兒，　　　　，大粒的涙珠兒　在那上面。</p>
<h3>初夏的上海</h3>
<p>— 庶幾</p>
<p>春風好像頑皮的孩子似地斗然間溜走了。</p>
<p>輕鬆的愉快的微笑，從行人的嘴巴上，墮入馬路上的塵埃裏，無聲無息地。陽光射入穿法蘭絨西裝的靑年的背脊上，癢癢地，彷彿是女人的指甲在輕輕地搔着。</p>
<p>正午的時候，行人道上，似乎有點冷落了。靠在玻璃櫃傍邊的小夥計，擦着惺惺的睡眼，厭惡地釘住不知趣的電車。一向沉默着的咖啡店，和一個預備改嫁的寡婦一樣，妝扮得異常美麗，掛在門外的汽水，冰淇淋…的招牌，比一二八時某報的紅字，還要使人注目。窗幃後的淸潔的客座上，坐着一對對的年輕的情侶，含着筆直的麥管，微笑着吮吸刨冰。Boy躱在牆角裏，偷偷地笑。</p>
<p>一路公共汽車的乘客，近來顯得特别擁擠，兆豐公園的遊人，打破了歴年的紀錄。</p>
<p>住在貧民窟裏的窮鬼，似乎得救了，笑咪咪地把冬衣送進當铺。</p>
<p>大肚皮的資木家，開始憂慮起來，連在夢中也緊鎖住了眉頭。</p>
<p>軟禁在洋房裏的少奶奶，無聊地逗着哈叭狗，消麽她們的永晝。靈魂飛出了軀壳，在白雲的底下，尋找她們的……。</p>
<p>天氣一天天地變化着，各個人的心境，也一天天地變化着。</p>
<p>敲過了八點鐘，黑牌子的汽車，發狂似地馳入了法界。莊嚴的英國的紳士，在車廂裏的暗處，偷吻着少女的裸着的胸膛。汽車夫在前面喃喃地咀駡着幾個擁脅鹹水妹在馬路中心唱着歌的喝醉了的水兵。</p>
<p>霞飛路上，海漾着浸在愛情和詩的幻夢裏的靑年男女。　　的白　，靠在電燈桿上，默默地回億一九一七年前的高　的祖國。</p>
<p>廬山？莫于山？……露臺上透下來的洋行買辯和姨太太的爭執。</p>
<p>「我好比：籠中烏？」朝西的亭子問的行客的　息。</p>
<p>電車馳過去，月臺裏擠滿了一堆人，經濟的兜風。</p>
<p>「平津和議告成！」電車站上的賣報的孩子，發出尖銳的聲音。</p>
<p>然而，似一顆石子投入淘湧的波濤裹一樣，誰也不留意。在簿紗裏的抖顫着的女人的乳頭，裸着的大脚，藕似的粉臂，迷住了行人的心。</p>
<p>整個的初夏的上海，沉醉在肉底氣息裏。</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（三十七）　不免吟詩一首</p>
<p>倉聖造書聞鬼哭，</p>
<p>文章招忌豈無由。秀才不畏狂言罪，詩客寗爲感憤休。肯以一脊談水怪，還將十年作山囚。憐羣獨向南荒去，雲海茫茫世路悠。　　芝岡自北平來，將有粤西之行，路過上海，復得聚首數日。以近著「中國水神神話的探討」一書見示，讀之終篇。如此生僻之題材，煩瑣之考證，能使讀者如讀流麗之論文，如讀生動之小說，洵爲中國謠俗學上前無古人之作，將以證諸同好，非予一人之私言也。芝岡瞬將别矣，禮吾聚仁謂宜有詩，予不免先吟一首，以俟諸君喤喤之音。况値中日互相諒解，天下自此太平，亦不可無我輩昏庸老朽之詩人，點綴如此盛世也。</p>
<h3>紅蘿蔔鬚</h3>
<p>— Jules　Kenaro作　林取譯</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚和他的父親往來書信選</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚給　辟克的信（寄自聖瑪克書院）：</p>
<p>親愛的爸爸，</p>
<p>我假期中的釣魚游戲把我的身體弄病了。我覺得我的腿脇上長出了一些大釘子。我現已病在床上。我仰天睡着，着護婦給我貼着膏藥。當那釘子還没有穿的時候，我感著痛楚。穿了以後我便不覺得了。可是這種釘子像小鷄一樣繁殖起來。醫好一個又長出三個新的。但我希望這毛病不久就會好的。</p>
<p>雷許克的回信：</p>
<p>親愛的紅羅蔔鬚，</p>
<p>你現在旣然在準備舉行第一次天主敎人門禮，並要研究數理問答，那你便應該曉得人類並不希望你把釘子帶給他們。耶稣基督的手上和脚上都有着釘子。他的釘子雖是眞的，但他没有半句怨言。</p>
<p>放勇敢些罷！　　　　　　　　　　　　　父識</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚給電辟克的信：</p>
<p>親愛的爸爸，我給你一個喜訊：我生了一個牙齒。雖然還没有到年齡，但我想這是一個早熟的　齒。我相信還有第二個接着生出來的。我會照常用功，守規則，以慰　注。</p>
<p>雷辟克的回信：</p>
<p>親愛的紅蘿蔔鬚，正當你的牙齒生出來的時候，我的一颗牙齒便開始搖動起來。直到昨天它才毅然落下。由此說來。你雖多了一顆牙齒，你你親却少了一顆。所以我們家裏所有的牙齒還是照舊毫無增减的。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚給雷辟克的信：</p>
<p>親愛的爸爸，我告訴你一事，看你能够想像得到不：昨天是我們的拉丁文敎員哲克先生壽辰，同班學生早就全體一致推舉我致祝辭。我受寵若驚，花了許多功夫預備那篇祝辭，我還很適當的在那裏面引用了幾句拉丁文。不客氣的說，這篇祝辭我自已是很滿意的。我用一張羊皮紙把它謄寫淸楚了，到了昨天我受着同學們低聲說着：「去呀，快去呀！」的鼓勵，便趁着哲克先生没有注意我們的時候跑到他的講座前面。可是當我剛剛反祝辭展開，高聲念着：</p>
<p>可敬的先生，</p>
<p>哲克先便憤然立起呌說：</p>
<p>「給我快滚回你的位子上去！」</p>
<p>你可以想到我是怎樣地連心逃回我的位子上坐下了。當我的同學們都把臉藏在書後面時，哲克先生却生氣地命令着我：</p>
<p>「给我把這段拉丁文翻譯出來。」</p>
<p>親愛的爸爸，你對於這事的感想如何？</p>
<p>雷辟克回紅蘿蔔鬚的信：</p>
<p>親愛的紅蘿蔔鬚，等到你做了議員時，你便可以看見很多同樣的事呢。各人有各人的職守。人家旣把你的敎員安置在講座上，那便顯然是要他來演說的，而不是要他來聽你演說的。（未完）</p>

<h3>倩理和麗娃</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>濃抺着許多脂粉，裝扮得嬌嬌滴滴，向着大衆演講抗日救國。被那冷倩理兩字是出於吳贛，含有梳妝打扮的意思。吳中婦女</p>
<p>派說幾句冷話，呌　：「抗日不忘情理，倩理也可抗日。」</p>
<p>，是以古稱蘇城爲「麗娃鄕。」在這國難嚴重的年頭兒，蘇城婦女的麗娃化，比着昔日「有過之，無不及。」麗娃化的紅樸千鑫，麗娃化的紅樸千金，麗娃化的豪門少婦，倒也罷了；還有麗娃化的小家碧玉，麗娃化的小販女郎。甚至，仰仗着倩理萬能，彷彿可以打動伊們年代的倒輸；有忘記二十歳的麗娃式半老徐娘，又有忘記三十歲的麗娃式白鬚婆婆。麗娃不麗娃，且慢理會；只是，麗娃的唯一使命，無非做了仇貨的推銷員，種種愛倩理的麗娃身上，多少總得推銷些「九人」牌出品。</p>
<p>女菩蕯，女菩蕯，向你們合十進言：你們愛倩理，便倩理；愛做麗娃，便做麗娃；這是你們的自由，無所用其反的。但，要曉得，從國貨上研究你們的倩理方法，才是眞倩理；在國貨上造成你們的麗娃，才是眞麗娃。女菩蕯，女菩蕯，信從此言，無量功德。</p>
<h3>讀史雜寫</h3>
<p>— 龍騷</p>
<p>明代顛覆純爲了朝廷上執權者充滿了庸臣腐吏所致。馬士英和阮大鋮，借了偏安的局面，用福王的名義，行使敵對復社名士頋杲等，終於專權昏憒，名器猥濫，一等到淸兵打到南京，馬被殺，阮大鋮乞和，從攻仙霞嶺，也就死了。宿遷女子倪瑞琄駡道：「賣國仍將身自賣，姦雄兩字惜稱君！」痛快之至。若比曹操的老奸巨滑，氣宇寬闊，眞是不能同日而語了。但世界上一直到現在。還有馬阮之流的國賊！</p>
<p>那時候姚雪菴大司馬，目擊明祚將絕，題友人的「猴兒抱籐眠枯樹圖」，有句道：猴兒要醒而今醒，莫待籐枯樹倒時丨丨丨但猴兒倒底不醒，樹倒之後，誤國的馬阮，終於死了。柄政賣國的殷鑒，如是如是。</p>
<p>史學家房龍（Hendrik　Vanloon）在人類的故事裏，叙述羅馬的滅亡最扼要地說：大部份的人民，都貪吃懶做，恣意縱樂，對於國家的行將滅亡情形，是全不知道；國内的靑年，爲了負不起苛稅，都從軍去爲野心帝皇謀利益，他們自生至死，在戰爭裏生活，第二第三世紀的皇帝，都當兵出身，靠了營盤裏弟兄們的力量，趕掉前任皇帝，起而代之；不久，自已也被另一個武人從宮中攢出去；於是都市變成了廢墟，人民飢餓搶掠，商業也停止了，……國便被附近的小民族所瓜分！我們讀了這段文章，轉眼來檢閱自已的國家，人民對政治不但不知道，而且不能知道，不許知道；靑年人飄流在都市裏無事可做，便丢掉筆，拿着槍，充實内戰的工具；只要一看各方面的情形，也無異於四七六年薄暮的羅馬！</p>
<h3>憑弔五卅烈士公墓</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>在下因爲五卅期届，而這個五卅公墓，又和在下的蝸居，望衡對字，所以在某一個黄昏裏，踱過去憑弔一番。目覩那黄土裏的舊創；懷念到長城邊的新痕，眞呌人感嘆無方，啼笑皆非。</p>
<p>說到那五卅公墓，是在八字橋北首不上半里路。在前年一二八的時候，這墓的四周，正是兩軍鏖戰的地方。至今還遺留着草長没脛的壕溝；像蜂窠般的彈痕。公墓佔地十餘畝，四周圍着矮墻。進門便是一隻置放碑銘的高壇，正中題着四個擘窠大字「來者勿忘」，是已故行政院長譚延闓的手筆。旁邊還有一篇銘文，是蔡元培先生撰，嚴愼予先生書。文中無非追悼死者，勗勵來茲，恕在下不贅述了！</p>
<p>再進數十步，便是烈士的墓穴了。那個墓穴，造得很别緻。用水泥砌造高有丈許的平壇，正中有石級，可以登臨。那壇縱有五六丈，横有六七丈，兩旁設有石凳，可以憇坐。正中便是高起的墓　。頂上　立着一　　　，向東引吭　鳴。它在呌醒東隣武力的迷夢呢？還是呌醒我們的醉生夢死？可是我敢說一聲：雄鷄呀！未免辜負你的美意吧！</p>
<p>石級的後面，隱藏着一個洞穴，可以直達置棺的所在。不過裏面照暗無光，必須秉着電炬和燭火，方可以進去。而且不甚通風，霉濕之氣，中人欲嘔。中間横列着十二具棺木，便是南京路上殺身成仁的烈士呀！</p>
<p>墓旁有一並排三間的平房，是作祭祀用的。門口坐着一個看墓的老嫗，倒也很喜歡講話。伊向我說道；「前年的一二八時候，我因没有逃難的資本，成日成夜的躱在墓穴裏。那墓穴的四周，厚厚的水泥塗着，像堡壘一般的堅固，槍彈和小炮彈，不能動其分毫。裏邊只要有食糧和燃料，眞一些也不擔心。後來有一隊軍士，在裏頭作了臨時指揮部，吃·喝·唱·說·倒也很熱閙，我便替他們煑飯，眞忘掉墓外正在子彈横飛咧。後來我軍退了，日軍來了，他們瞧我年老孤焭，倒也一些不難爲；而且對於墓中的英魂，深深的致了一番敬禮。</p>
<p>墓中的英魂呀！你們長眠地下，目瞑心死嗎？前年閘北的蹂躪，已經使你們不安了。現在回首北望，更使你們痛恨咧！哭呀！哭呀！綠草白楊，也在肅蕭肅蕭悲泣；暮鴉池蛙，也在嗚嗚的哀嗚！</p>
<h3>劉海粟先生歐游作品展覽會圖目序</h3>
<p>— 孫科</p>
<p>中西畫家皆重傳授，惟重傳授，故有宗法，弟子不必不如師，神而明之，存乎其人，故由一宗而衍爲若干派，由一派而又衍爲若干支，派中有派，支中有支，殆如佛家之衣鉢焉。使欲於藝苑中嶄然露頭角，而上無所承，亦必自以其作近于何支何派者而依傍之，非如是則不足以服人，人亦將譏爲無源之水，無本之木矣。海粟劉君，天材卓犖，獨以爲此乃寄人籬下，卽成名而名非我名，卽成家而家非我家也，于是養其氣凝其神而默運之，涵其性歛其情而淵思之，遠其足于東西洋而肆觀之，舉凡獸之走，禽之翔，魚之游，草木之賁華，雲霞之蒸蔚，高崖深壑古戍寒城宇宙間一切可玩可娛可驚可愕可歌可泣者，一一蓄之于胸，蓄之旣久，豁然有會于心，乃沛然脫之于手，有度無度，因物與合，不知有宗，何論支派，遂自號日藝術叛徒。聞名者或疑其不古不今，不中不西，而無所于成，不知君正欲無古無今無中無西，而自成其爲我也。西方詩聖拜倫有言，人間是大，而自然更大，君之自成爲我，乃以我與自然爲一，其爲大也，超于人間矣。孟子曰：待文王而後興者，凡民也。彼囿于宗法支派者，何足以語此？吾聞佛家又有頓悟法，君其頓悟者歟？願以告世之讀君畫者。</p>

<h3>東北四回連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第八回　憤語激靑年辭官遁去</p>
<p>熱心憐少女挾纊親來</p>
<p>桂枝搖着頭，將耳朶上兩隻長耳墜子，搖擺得在臉上打了幾下，鼓了嘴笑道：我不曉得！說完了這四個字，他就走進裏面屋子裏去了。江氏和關連長，隔了一張桌子坐着，將茶杯又推了一推笑道：到我們家來，眞是待慢得很，吃没有吃的，喝没有喝的。關耀武道：我在後面院子裏，吃也吃了，喝也喝了，現在都用不着，我是特意拜年來了。江氏說着話時，手只管在身上去掏銅子，笑道：不吃不喝，烟捲總要抽兩根。關耀武連連搖着手道：烟捲也不要抽，等着我們表妹出閣的日子，我再來喝你一杯喜酒罷。江氏笑道：你老是提到這句話上來。還是眞有心跟你表妹作媒呢？還是開開玩笑的？關耀武道：眞的呀！怎麽會是光開玩笑呢？桂枝一個人坐在屋子裏坑上，兩手正互相剝着指頭，聽外面說些什麽。現在聽到關耀武說眞個作媒，這就不由得他心裏，卜通跳了兩下。於是坐着靠近了牆一點，側了耳朶，再向隔壁聽了去。這個時候，關耀武的聲音，忽然小了起來，卿卿噥噥，不知他說些什麽。因爲他的聲音小了，於是乎自已母親的聲音也小了。彷彿聽到江氏這樣說了一句，我們還有什麽不願意的呢？桂枝聽了這話，心裏頭更是砰砰亂跳。不過自已没有把話聽出個頭緒來，究竟是不是說到息已頭上還不得而知，在這個暗昧的情形之下，就是要反對也反對不得，若是母親不承認時，倒要說是自已多心。作姑娘的人，對婚姻問題多心，這可是不體面的事。因之自心在怎想聽而又不便公然聽的時候，就横躺在坑上，側了臉，靜靜的睡着，事實上他也是在聽屋子外面人說話。（八六）</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>初夏的魚</h3>
<p>— 朱靑藝</p>
<p>「魚我所欲也。」那位寄食孟嘗君門下的馮老先生，因眼瞧着整條鮮美的魚，袛送到别人桌上，自已魚湯也嘗不到一滴，不由不大發牢騷，倚着柱，大彈其劍鋏，呐喊着：「長鋏歸來乎？食無魚！」是的，魚，確是美味；那松江的鑪，黄河的鯉，眞是名聞全國的名魚，杭州的醋魚，更是西子湖頭著名的嘉餚。在這初夏時候，正是錦鱗上市的時候，下面所記的，都是江南食譜中，應時的魚。</p>
<p>甲魚　甲魚，是　的俗稱。在牡丹開花的時候，是甲魚最吃香的時期，他的滋味，正是鮮腴肥美，恰到好處，呌做「牡丹甲魚，」過了這時，就老不可食，變成「人老珠黄不値錢」了。甲魚雖呌做魚，却是有甲有脚的爬蟲，他的裙邊，不但肥腴可口，并且還是滋陰補品。煮食的時候，須先在沸水中剝去他的黑皮。食法有兩種。和火腿淸煮，雖然淸腴適口，然而和鮮肉紅燒，却更來得肥膩有味。甲魚紅肚皮的，傳說是由蛇蛻變的，有毒，不可吃。</p>
<p>黄魚　黄魚，亦呌夏魚，蘇州人家，在立夏那天，都要家家煮食，以應時景。黄魚的肉，鮮肥適口，並且魚骨很少，尤便於大嚼。黄魚共有大小兩種，出產在浙江南海裏面，在春江水暖的時候，魚就成陣的由南而來，在這時候，魚船就結夥前往捕捉了。黄魚的食法，最簡便的，是和着醬油酒燉食；紅燒也可以，紅燒拆去魚骨，煮成魚羹，和麵一同煮食，吃起來眞是其味無窮哩！</p>
<p>鰣魚　鰣魚出產在常熟和鎭江大江裏面，浙江富春江頭，也有產生的。鰣魚是江南人家端牛節禮物中不可或缺的應時珍品，往往魚已變了味，兀是由傭僕們拎着，送來送去。鰣魚的食法，大都和南腿，猪油，一同淸燉。他的魚鱗下脂肪很多，所以吃起來，並不把魚鱗除去，是食魚中别緻的事兒。鰣魚貴新鮮，所以講究吃食的人，往往到金山下面，等鰣魚出水，立卽煮食，聽說在鮮美中另有一種淸香，非普通鰣魚，能够比並；因爲鰣魚一離水，立時卽死，非就地煮食不可了。</p>
<p>䰾魚　䰾魚也是初夏時上市的鮮魚，他的形狀，好像小的河豚，黄色黑斑；白色的肚皮，能够漲得很大，光緻緻的很是别緻。䰾魚吃的時候，須把魚皮撕去。䰾魚的肺，很好吃，在初上市的當兒，宛似豆瓣一般，嫰肥鮮美，入口卽酥，確是别有風味。于右任先生在木瀆石家飯店吃到了䰾肺湯，竟大發詩興，在壁上寫下贊美詩句；後來因李根源先把「䰾」改了「魞」，于老先生大爲不滿，竟重把他的詩，寫在紙上，寄給石家，至今在木瀆留下一件韻事　　鮝魚　鮺魚的味很鹹，是飯菜中最能下飯的菜肴。他的食法燉食，紅燒，都很不差；和麵粉同煮，更是津津有味。鮝魚頭上的魚骨，可以做成一令飛翔的仙鶴，和蟹蝶同樣是别緻的玩物。</p>
<p>初夏的魚，除了上面幾種，還有「考予魚」「烏賊魚」等等。「釣於水，鮮可食」，儘够饕餮家的大嚼哩。不過我寫到這裏，忽的想起一件關於魚的故事；「宋城門失火，國人搶救，汲池水以滅火，水涸，池魚盡死」。在北平敵機飛繞，東北範障盡失的當兒，我們小百姓，終有一天做遭殃的池魚。可是環顧國内，靑年們是在跳舞救國，商人們在娼妓救國，乂乂們是在鴉片救國，－－賭博救國，兀是悠游於燃着薪的釜中。除了聽做爼上魚肉，任人宰割，還有什麽出路！眞要應那句「我其魚乎」的話哩！</p>

<h3>目下靑年應有的態度</h3>
<p>— 錦質</p>
<p>可敬愛的是靑年、可賤惡的亦是靑年，思想純正的是靑年，思想卑鄙的也是靑年、誤入歧途勇於作惡的是靑年，最激烈會犧牲的也是靑年，總之，靑年一切的一切，都在可愛和可惡之間，而人類社會的進化·或退化，亦以靑年轉移之力爲最大。</p>
<p>一般人都這樣想吧，未來的人類幸福生活，要靑年去尋覓，未來的和平天國，要靑年去創造，靑年是純正潔白，有良心的，照此看來，靑年多麽有希望，靑年的責任何等重大，靑年要照着良心，說經正潔白的話，做潔白公正的事，當然是無疑了，無如目下社會的狀態，眞是五花八門，無奇不有，一切舊的惡習慣惡勢力，雖回光反照般在那裏張牙舞爪，一般有志靑年，都未必放牠在眼裏，惟「言僞而辨，行非而僻」的快樂和自由主義，」確是靑年的大敵，牠亦是靑年的引誘者，利用靑年放浪的弱點，急功近利的心裏，以金錢美女，惑得你頭昏目眩，且「貪而無厭」的日本人，也利用靑年喜升官發財的弱點，來惑你作漢奸，使你聽得神迷心癢，死心場地供軀策，雖死亦無後悔，只要你能搗亂，行牠的政策，你便可升官發財，靑年們假使踏上牠的迷途，誰不興高彩烈，以爲享盡人間之福，做了人間權力之王？但是，我們自負有良心的靑年，自稱思想純正潔白的靑年，大家承認這是對嗎？這就算是社會革命嗎？我們要是承認牠，那麽自已早向惡的路上跑，使國家向着亡國滅種的路前進，社會向着退化的道上走了呀！</p>
<p>我們靑年應有的願望，要偉大的，普遍的，希望大家都來做生產的工作，使全人類都過自由平等的幸福，世界上一切的人類都發展本能，世界上一切的人類都有永久性的互助博愛，造成一極樂的世界。這是我們靑年應走的大道，目下一切略奪式的，强權的，是倒行逆施的，背乎人道的，所以我旣做目下的靑年，非持愼重研究的態度不可，登山須用步行，投水只消一跳，所以我們非特爲眞理而犧牲，不爲近功小利所惑的堅忍態度不可。</p>

They will go to Jurenhui to meet He Yingqin to report on the ceasefire negotiations. The Japanese representative, Okamura, etc., will also return to Changchun tonight. Xu stated that the Japanese side was quite sincere about the ceasefire, and did not make things difficult on minor issues, so the process went smoothly. The issue of the Manchurian army was mentioned during the meeting and needs to be resolved through private negotiations between the two parties in Peiping. There are no restrictions on the number of our personnel stationed in the areas from which both sides are withdrawing. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Sino-Japanese ceasefire negotiations held their first official meeting at 4:00 PM on the 30th at the Japanese Osaka Shosen Co. in Tanggu. Security was very tight. The two sides held a second round of talks at 10:00 AM on the 31st. Because all issues had been agreed upon verbally beforehand, there was no lengthy discussion, and the formal signing took place at 12:00 noon. It is reported that the content of the agreement is very simple, covering only the military scope and not touching on politics. The key points of concern for both sides are the handling of the puppet troops and the handover of the occupied areas. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Outline of the Agreement Contents</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The ceasefire agreement is announced as follows: The ceasefire agreement between the representatives of the North China Army and the Kwantung Army in Tanggu was signed at 11:10 AM on the 31st.

<p>(3) When the Japanese army confirms that the Chinese army has withdrawn to the line agreed upon in item 1, it will not pursue further beyond that line, and will automatically return to the line of the Great Wall.</p>
<p>(4) The maintenance of law and order in the area south of the Great Wall line and north and east of the line agreed upon in item 1 will be the responsibility of the Chinese police.</p>
<p>(5) This agreement shall take effect immediately upon signing. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>First Meeting</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since the Sino-Japanese ceasefire agreement was scheduled to be discussed in Tanggu on the 30th, the representatives of both sides, totaling twenty people, arrived safely at Tanggu Station at 2:25 PM on the 30th on a special train prepared by the Beining Railway Bureau. Temporary, strict precautions were taken. After the representatives got off the train, they went to the Yongli Alkali Factory to rest. At about 3:00 PM, Jiuda Fine Salt Company prepared lunch and hosted the representatives from China and Japan. After the representatives finished their meals at about 4:00 PM, the first meeting was held at the Japanese Osaka Shosen Co. During the meeting, only opinions were exchanged, and no concrete decisions were made on the troop withdrawal issue. It is expected that the second meeting will continue at 9:00 AM on the 31st. It is reported that the scope of the discussion is limited to military affairs and does not involve political issues. Our side is determined to stick to the established policy and deal with everything. The situation is quite good. According to military sources, the first meeting of Chinese and Japanese representatives was held at the Osaka Shosen Co. in Tanggu at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th. The representatives of China and Japan were as follows: The highest representative of the Chinese side was Xiong Bin, Chief Counselor of the Beiping Military Branch. The staff members were Qian Zongze, Counselor, Lei Shourong, Advisor, Xu Yanmou, Staff Officer of the Military Branch, Yin Rugeng, Staff Officer, Zhang Xiguang, Chief of Staff of the First Army Corps, and Li Zeyi, Counselor. The highest representative of the Japanese side was Okamura Neiji, Deputy Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army. The staff members were Kita Seiichi, Colonel of the Infantry, Nagatsu Sabijiro, Military Attaché of the Embassy, Lieutenant Colonel of the Infantry, Kawano Etsujiro, Staff Officer of the Division, Major of the Infantry, Endo Saburo, Army Staff, Fujimoto Tetsugoro, Major of the Infantry, Okabe Eiichi, Captain of the Cavalry, Staff Officer of the Division, Translator, Hayashide Kenjiro, Adjutant to the Military Attaché, Ito Akira, Captain of the Artillery, and Military Staff Officer, Shizishi Yukinori, Captain of the Army Artillery. The participants were Oki Kumao, Staff Officer of the North China Garrison Army, Lieutenant General of the Infantry, Fujiwara Kiyoshou, Naval Major, Attaché of the Embassy, and Nakayama Shoichi, Secretary of the Embassy. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Second Meeting</h3>
<p>Tanggu: The second ceasefire meeting was held at 8:40 AM today. The Japanese representatives, led by Major General Okamura, first left the Fuji Hotel, and were photographed by photographers in front of the main gate of the Japanese garrison. The Chinese committee members stayed inside their cars, guarded by Chinese military police. Before 8:00 AM, all the committee members gathered in the first-class car of Chief Representative Xiong Bin to prepare for the agreement. At 8:55 AM, Xiong and others got out of the car, went around the Baihe Wharf, and arrived at the meeting place through the back door of the Japanese garrison. The second formal meeting began at 9:00 AM. The area around the meeting place was guarded by Japanese military police. The atmosphere at the meeting was very calm, and the proceedings went smoothly. The meeting ended at 11:20 AM. The Chinese representatives and Lieutenant Colonel Nagatsu left the meeting room with happy expressions, from which it can be inferred that the atmosphere inside the meeting room was harmonious. When asked about this by a certain staff member of the Japanese side, he said that the Japanese army's purpose was not to destroy China, and asked people to infer the state of today's meeting from this statement. His words were full of meaning. Judging from the attitude and expression of Major General Okamura, it can be known that ceasefire cooperation has been fully achieved. Although the fundamental solution to the Sino-Japanese dispute in the past three years still requires twists and turns and time, the war clouds over North China have dissipated, and the prelude to the complete peace of China and Japan is being played in Tanggu. (31st Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Change of Garrison Largely Completed by Our Army</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) After the ceasefire negotiations showed some progress, our army has been transferring troops to the south of Changping, Shunyi, Gaoliying, Tongzhou, Xianghe, Baodi, Linting, and Ninghe. This has been largely completed. The Japanese army is also in the original occupied areas and has not advanced further. However, their so-called special work, such as the unrest caused by puppet troops in plain clothes, does not seem to have stopped. Our side is paying close attention to the disturbances caused by these rebels, and when the ceasefire negotiations began, we hoped that the Japanese side would take effective measures to suppress them. However, the Japanese side seems to be very insistent on temporarily designating a non-militarized zone in the designated area, which we are particularly opposed to. It is still difficult to speculate on how it will be decided. (30th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization Issue Not Discussed</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to reliable sources on the Chinese side, the Chinese and Japanese sides have agreed that the issue of "Manchukuo" will not be discussed within the scope of future meetings. The official gazette published this year stated that the Japanese warship carrying Japanese representative Iso arrived in Tanggu yesterday, and is now docked outside the port, while Iso is stationed in the Japanese barracks. This morning, another Japanese warship equipped with 7.5 cm cannons arrived. (30th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Military Police Protect Representatives' Special Train</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The special train carrying the representatives to the ceasefire conference arrived in Tianjin at 11:00 AM on the 30th. The local authorities, because someone threw a bomb when Huang Fu's northbound special train passed through Tianjin last time, took special precautions this time. Soldiers were dispatched to guard and patrol the bridges and railways along the way from Peiping to Tanggu. In this city, from 10:00 AM, Dongma Road, Beima Road, Dahu Tong, Dajing Road to Xin Zhan, the military and police were lined up and traffic was cut off. There were also similar precautions from Wanguo Bridge to Lao Zhan. Yu Xuezhong boarded the special train, had a conversation for two hours, and sent Zhang Peiwen, Chief of Staff, to accompany him to the east. There was a pilot train in front of the special train, and the police escort was strict, making people recall the time when Marshal Zhang Da entered the pass, which was no more than this. At 2:10 PM, he arrived in Tanggu. The representatives went to the Yongli Company to eat. The negotiation location was in the Japanese military club. The Japanese destroyer No. 16 arrived in Tanggu at 11:00 AM on the 30th. When the special train of the peace talk representatives arrived in Tianjin, the Japanese side sent three people including Staff Officer Oashi to Xin Zhan to welcome them. Our representative X went to the Japanese barracks to visit Nakamura for a period of time. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Personnel Attending from Both China and Japan</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The first meeting of Chinese and Japanese representatives was held at the Osaka Shosen Co. in Tanggu at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 30th. (A) Chinese side: (1) Highest representative Xiong Bin; (2) Staff members Qian Zongze, Lei Shourong, Xu Yanmou, Yin Rugeng, Zhang Xiguang; (3) Advisor Li Zeyi. (B) Japanese side: Highest representative Okamura Neiji; (2) Staff members Kita Seiichi, Nagatsu Hiju, Kawano Etsujiro, Endo Saburo, Fujimoto Tetsugoro, Okabe Eiichi, Ito Akira Shizishi Yukinori; (3) Participating members Oashi Kumao Fujiwara Kiyoshiro, Nakayama Shoichi; (4) Translator Hayashide Kenjiro. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Side's Troop Withdrawal Location Issue</h3>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain source, the key issues in this agreement have been discussed quite thoroughly by both sides beforehand. The most important disputes are the location of the Japanese troop withdrawal and the handling of Li Jichun's puppet troops in the Guannei area. If the location of the Japanese troop withdrawal is specified, it seems to be detrimental to sovereignty. If it is not specified and the term "Great Wall line" is used indiscriminately, the Great Wall line is too long and prone to misunderstandings, and the Great Wall cannot be regarded as a false national border, so the wording is quite difficult to consider. Regarding Li Jichun's troops, the Japanese side initially believed that they were Chinese anti-Japanese forces and had nothing to do with Japan. Our side believed that Li was a traitor to our country under the instructions of the Japanese side, and must be withdrawn by the Japanese side and not allowed to remain in the area after the withdrawal of troops from both sides. It is reported that the Japanese side is not very insistent on these two points, and it is hoped that a subtle provision can be made in the meeting. The agreement can be signed within a few days, and the Japanese side will formally withdraw its troops after the meeting, completing the peace in North China. Official sources formally deny that a third party participated in the peace talks. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>He Zhuguo Arrives in Peiping from Yangcun</h3>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo said that he took a train from Yangcun to Peiping this afternoon. Reports that he accompanied the special train of the Sino-Japanese armistice negotiation representatives to Tianjin yesterday were inaccurate. After his troops were ordered to move from Luanxi, they are now concentrated in the area west of Lutai to Yangcun. This time, he came to report the troop transfer process to He Yingqin and ask for instructions on everything. He will return to the defense area within a few days. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Zhuguo arrived in Peiping by special train from the defense area this afternoon at 5:00 PM with his family members. He will visit He Yingqin to ask for instructions on defense issues. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Qun's Trip to Tanggu is Inaccurate</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Zhang Qun is still in Peiping. Reports from Tianjin that he has gone to Tianjin and then to Tanggu are inaccurate. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Forty-Seven Generals in North China Deny Being Listed in Telegram</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The forty-seven generals in North China, Wan Fulin, Yu Xuezhong, Liu Yifei, Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, etc., issued a telegram saying that the radio station received two telegrams on the 30th, falsely using the names of Mr. Zhang Zuoxiang and Fulin, etc., to slander the government, and the wording was absurd. Fulin and others are military personnel and only know how to obey orders. All the previous telegrams were purely falsely used names, with the intention of provoking discord. Fearing confusion, they specifically stated this in a telegram. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are now two telegrams broadcast from Tianjin, one opposing the suspension of work meetings, led by Zuoxiang, and the rest are division and brigade commanders, responding to Feng Youdian, also led by Zuoxiang, and the rest of the listed names are North China generals Wan Shang Song Pang and others. It is heard that Shang and others denied participating in the listed telegrams, and telegraphed tonight to deny them. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>19th Route Anti-Japanese Army Ordered to Postpone Advance North</h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) Because China and Japan are brewing a compromise and North China has ceased fire, Cai Tingkai telegraphed Zhang Yan and Yi Qixiu, ordering the various units arriving in Chenzhou to postpone their advance north and await further orders. The Guangdong office of the 19th Route Army also temporarily suspended donations for anti-Japanese military expenses. The Guangdong Anti-Japanese Army Zhang Haodong Regiment was also ordered to return to Shaozhou from Lechang. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Central Government Replies to Jiang and Cai by Telegram</h3>
<p>(Fuzhou) The Central Government replied to Jiang and Cai by telegram, saying that the temporary ceasefire in Peiping and Tianjin is not a humiliating compromise. The ceasefire method is limited to local military affairs and does not involve the political scope. If Japan uses this to come, it will be strictly rejected. (29th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Circle and Reconnoiter in Tongzhou, Gaoliying, and Other Places</h3>
<p>(Beiping) One Japanese plane came to Tongzhou this morning, circling and reconnoitering over the county town for a long time. Two Japanese planes flew from Changping to Gaoliyingzi this morning, circled for several weeks, and flew south. At 3:00 PM yesterday, four or five Japanese people reconnoitered for a long time at the Bliwubanqiao bridge in the north. Also, every morning, many cavalrymen go to our defense line and reconnoiter from time to time. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Langfang reports that the few Japanese scout soldiers in Luofa area the day before yesterday left that night. It is now peaceful. There is no change in Shunyi. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Aircraft Reconnoiter Peiping</h3>
<p>Communication Tube Dropped in Japanese Barracks</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese side previously notified our military and police authorities, roughly saying that Japanese aircraft will still fly to Peiping for inspection within a few days. Please do not shoot them and tell the citizens not to be alarmed. At about 9:00 AM this morning, a Japanese plane flew over the northern suburbs of Peiping for inspection and flew from northwest to southeast. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese aircraft came to Peiping twice this morning. The first time was at about 5:00 AM. It was a reconnaissance plane that flew over the northeastern suburbs of the city and then went east. The second time was at 11:15 AM. It was a large twin-wing aircraft, which flew from the aircraft carrier in Tanggu. The altitude was very low, only about 300 meters. A communication tube was dropped in the Japanese embassy's barracks. The content was roughly a report on the Sino-Japanese armistice agreement in Tanggu yesterday. Then it circled twice and flew east. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zheng Guilin's Troops Recapture Tianzhuangtai</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Yesterday afternoon, a Japanese armored vehicle shelled our Tianzhuang line, covering the advance of the puppet troops, and came into contact with Zheng Guilin's troops. Tianzhuangtai was once occupied by the puppet troops, but Zheng personally led the guards in a brave counterattack. After holding out until 3:00 or 4:00 PM, the rebellious troops were unable to withstand the defeat and retreated. Zheng's army then recovered its original position. (30th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Peiping Military Branch Regular Meeting</h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Peiping Military Branch held its ninth regular meeting at Jurenhui at 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the 31st. The attending committee members included Wan Fulin, Bao Wenxun, Jiang Bocheng, Wang Shuchang, Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Xiao Zhenying, Liu Yifei, Men Zhizhong, Zheng Zuohua, Pang Bingxun, Wei Zonghan, Fu Zuoyi, Gao Weiyue, Ji Yiqiao, Hu Yukun, etc., chaired by He Yingqin. Many routine cases were passed, and the military supply team reported on the receipt and expenditure of military expenses. The meeting adjourned at 6:00 PM. (31st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At about 5:00 AM this morning, the military branch sent Counselor Zhao Xun by special train to Lutai to convey military orders. (31st Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tangyu Line to Be Opened to Traffic</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) After the Kailuo Mining Bureau requested that traffic be opened on the Tangyu line, the Beining Railway Bureau specially sent engineer Mr. Niusun to supervise more than 600 workers to repair the track west of Changli. It has now been completely repaired. The mining bureau plans to allocate three trains to restore passenger and freight trains between Tangyu and Lutai. Before the Beining line is opened to traffic, all income will be kept in a separate account and will be implemented within two or three days. Rumors that the false Fengshan line will be directly opened to traffic are inaccurate. (30th Central Dispatch)</p>

On the morning of the 29th, they discussed issues related to the central party and government. That evening, Huang Shaoxiong arrived and reported on the situation in North China. After final consultations, they unanimously agreed on a policy of partial détente, in order to allow the long-suffering troops and impoverished people to recuperate. However, the principle of non-capitulation and unconditional terms would be adhered to in the armistice negotiations, which would be limited to military matters and not involve political or legal issues. They immediately telegraphed Huang Fu to comply with the negotiation process and to report to the Central Government for instructions at any time. The meeting also decided to maintain the status quo of the central political structure. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>

The meeting adjourned at 2:00 AM on the 30th. The content was not disclosed due to its confidential nature.

As Wang was leaving, he told a Central News Agency reporter that he had come to discuss central political affairs and the policy for dealing with the North China issue with Chiang, and that he had also discussed important central matters. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Wang Issues Written Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After Premier Wang arrived in Nanjing, he issued the following written statement: "The Hebei armistice negotiations are limited to military affairs and do not involve politics. The representatives sent by the military authorities at the front are sufficient proof of this. Military representatives, of course, have no power or ability to negotiate political issues. People say that we lost territory in the past through non-resistance, and now we are losing territory through resistance. This is indeed true. If one measures the existing national strength, it is clear from the outset that resistance cannot achieve victory. Knowing this, we still resist, only to do our utmost and to satisfy our conscience. Since March, our troops have fought bitterly with the enemy along the Great Wall. The enemy possesses the most advanced offensive tools of modern times, such as heavy artillery, tanks, and aerial bombardment, which our troops lack. Even when we have some, the quantity and quality are far from being a match for the enemy. We rely only on our spirit of loyalty and bravery, and our flesh and blood. When a position is destroyed, our lives end with it. After suffering casualties, we make strategic retreats. The tragic and heroic facts are obvious and cannot be concealed. In addition, there are the disturbances of the Red bandits in various places and other constraints, and reinforcements do not arrive in time, which prevents the entire military plan from being implemented. The exhausted supply of the people in the war zone, and the displacement and suffering caused by the war, are also witnessed by the entire nation. All these sacrifices are a resolute expression of the nation's struggle for its personality and the people's search for survival. As for success or failure, we have never considered it from the beginning. At this moment, the government and the troops under its command will not abandon their determination to make a final sacrifice as long as there is a breath of life left. Therefore, as for the speculation from the outside world that there will be a signing of a treaty acknowledging the cession of territory, I dare to guarantee to the people at home and abroad that there will be no such thing. As for partial détente, which does not affect territorial sovereignty or the international status we have achieved, the government will resolutely take responsibility for it for the sake of allowing the long-suffering troops and impoverished people to rest and recuperate. We will appeal to the people with right and wrong, benefits and harms, and rely on true and lasting judgment." (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Central Government Convenes Important Meeting</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 3:00 PM on the 31st, the Central Government convened an important meeting. Those in attendance included Wang Zhaoming, Sun Ke, Luo Wengan, Lin Sen, Dai Chuanxian, Ju Zheng, Gu Mengyu, Ye Chucang, Chen Guofu, Chen Shaokuan, Zhu Peide, Chen Shuren, Chen Yi, Chen Gongbo, Chu Minyi, Huang Musong, Shi Qingyang, He Yaozu, Liu Ruiheng, and more than 20 others. Wang reported on his journey to Xunyang and Huang Fu's recent report. All committee members unanimously agreed with the results of the Lushan meeting. The meeting adjourned at about 5:00 PM. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Sun Ke and Others Fly from Xunyang to Nanjing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke, Ma Chaojun, and Huang Shaoxiong flew from Xunyang at 9:00 AM on the 31st aboard a China National Aviation Corporation plane and arrived in Nanjing at 12:30 PM. Liang Hancai and Zhu Jiahua changed their plans and returned to Nanjing on the 1st. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Sun Ke told reporters on the 31st that the details of the journey to Xunyang were covered in Premier Wang's statement. Whether the temporary National Congress will be held as scheduled was discussed at the Lushan meeting, but it must be decided by the Central Standing Committee. The draft constitution will be completed as scheduled. The organization of the central government will remain unchanged. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Luo Wengan Denies Resignation Rumors</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign Minister Luo said that Premier Wang's statement was quite detailed about the journey to Xunyang, so he would not comment further. In short, the central leaders will never yield to Japanese military force. However, armistice negotiations are aimed at achieving partial détente, so that exhausted troops and the people can rest and recuperate, and will be limited to military affairs and not involve politics. All committee members agreed on this. As for the rumors that he was resigning, he did not know where they came from. He accepted his appointment during a time of crisis, determined to sacrifice himself and fight for the country. Although he was exhausted mentally and physically, he would not hesitate to do so. Now that the national crisis is pressing and the future is perilous, how dare he seek leisure and comfort? In the future, diplomacy will continue to be carried out actively in accordance with the will of the Central Government. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong Declines Appointment to Beiping Political Affairs Committee</p>

He has decided to decline the position on the Beiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee. If he is in Beiping, he can assist in everything at any time. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Chiang Still Goes to Nanchang to Supervise Bandit Suppression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Reporters have learned that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will stay in Xunyang for one or two days and then go to Nanchang to supervise the suppression of Red bandits. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Wang Attends Central Political Conference and Reports</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Jingwei returned to Nanjing on the morning of the 31st and immediately attended the 59th meeting of the Central Political Conference. Wang reported on his journey to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang, saying that decisions had been made on military affairs in North China and the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi. The armistice in North China is a local military issue and will not involve political issues or any diplomatic issues. As for the bandit suppression work, Chiang has established a new plan and is implementing it step by step. It is hoped that a general conclusion can be reached in the near future. Wang also reported and explained on the diplomatic policy to be followed after the armistice and the issue of the Southwest. (Special dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3>The Four-Power Pact May Be Signed Today</h3>
<p>Rome Preparing Grand Ceremony</p>
<p>A Prelude to the Conclusion of the Disarmament Convention</p>
<p>(Paris) The Four-Power Pact has been drafted and is expected to be initialed in Rome on Thursday, June 1, in the afternoon by Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the ambassadors of France, Britain, and Germany to Rome. The full text of the pact is prepared to be published simultaneously in the capitals of the four countries: Britain, France, Germany, and Italy. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Rome: The Italian government has prepared a grand signing ceremony for the Four-Power Pact, which may be signed within 48 hours. The venue is the Palazzo Venezia, where Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and the ambassadors of Britain, France, and Germany will each sign the first letter of their names as proof. Mussolini's plan is for the major powers to guarantee each other to ensure the security of Europe. However, British Prime Minister MacDonald interprets this pact as hoping that smaller countries can also participate. Mussolini's initial proposal stipulated compelling Germany to demand the revision of the peace treaty, but it is heard that the final draft has been amended to gradually, rather than immediately, revise the peace treaty. It is recognized here that the four countries' agreement to this pact is an indication that the dispute over the British disarmament plan in Geneva has been largely resolved. There are also expectations that a disarmament convention can be agreed upon before the opening of the London World Economic Conference. (National dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>France Weakens the Power of the Pact</p>
<p>(Paris) France is still secretly working to reduce the real value of the Four-Power Pact, hoping to adapt it to its own needs and maintain its hegemony in Europe through military alliances. A correspondent for Le Matin in Geneva reports that French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour intends to supplement the Four-Power Pact with guarantees, and the original text of the meeting minutes contains four main points: (1) The Four-Power Pact does not harm existing treaties between France and its allied countries. (2) France cannot agree to any attempt to raise territorial issues defined by treaty revisions. (3) All procedural issues must be submitted to the League of Nations, the only appropriate international body, for resolution. (4) France will uphold the principle of unanimous agreement within the League of Nations, which should also include the countries concerned. According to Le Matin, these meeting minutes will be sent to the governments of the four contracting states and the Little Entente countries on the day the Four-Power Pact is signed. (National dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>German Government Has Announced Its Support</p>
<p>Rome: The German government announced today its support for the full text of the Four-Power Pact, which has been accepted by Italy, France, and Britain. It also supports the application of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant on sanctions, and the pact will be valid for ten years. The provisions of the Four-Power Pact have been revised and are currently being proofread. As for the language used in the pact, it may be in French only, or in both English and French as requested by Britain, or in all four languages: English, French, German, and Italian. In case of doubt, French will prevail. It has not yet been decided which of these three methods will be used. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German officials were still expressing doubts yesterday about the impending signing of the Four-Power Pact, but this morning they appeared optimistic, saying that diplomatic negotiations were proceeding smoothly. Berlin expects the Four-Power Pact to be signed soon. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Little Entente Countries Express Understanding</p>
<p>Prague, Czechoslovakia: After a meeting of the Political Standing Committee of the Little Entente countries this afternoon, a communique was issued stating that the ministers of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Romania declared that their respective countries had exchanged ratification documents for the treaty signed by the Little Entente countries in Geneva on February 16, 1933. Regarding the Four-Power Pact, the Political Standing Committee believes that the newly proposed provisions are in line with the spirit of the memorandum submitted by the French government on April 10 of this year, namely, that the Four-Power Pact can only involve the interests of the signatory states themselves. The Political Standing Committee believes that the Four Powers have satisfied the important objections raised by the Little Entente countries, and the signatory states of the Four-Power Pact themselves recognize the limitations of what they will do. The Little Entente countries have taken note of the guarantees given by the Four Powers in this regard. The so-called limitations are: (1) The authority of the League of Nations will not be changed in any way. (2) The principle of unanimous agreement must be applied to the application of Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant (i.e., the General Assembly of the League of Nations may at any time request member states to review treaties that are no longer applicable and consider international situations that may endanger world peace). In addition, France has also explicitly assured the Little Entente countries that the Four Powers will not make any attempts to modify the treaties based on prior agreement. Therefore, the Four-Power Pact, whether directly or indirectly, cannot become an agreement to modify the current borders of the Little Entente countries. After studying the issue of revising the territorial clauses in the peace treaties, the three ministers formally and definitively stated their views on this matter as follows: namely, that the issue of revising the current borders of the Little Entente countries will not be raised, as mentioned above. However, in principle, the three countries should still declare that any oppression of any country to force it to recognize the modification of borders will not be recognized by the Little Entente countries. Regarding the Geneva disarmament issue, the three ministers continue to hope that it will achieve concrete results. The three countries support the British disarmament plan as the basis for a future disarmament convention. They also support the principle of unifying the military systems of the European continent and the principle of reducing armaments. As for the principle of equality in armaments, it is also supported by the three countries within the scope that can guarantee the security of all countries. The Little Entente countries have also decided to firmly demand that the Disarmament Conference make detailed regulations on the effective supervision system of disarmament and entrust this power to the Permanent Disarmament Commission. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Poland Declares Extreme Opposition</p>
<p>Warsaw: Political circles here declare that Poland is extremely opposed to the Four-Power Pact, and that no matter what the attitude of the Little Entente countries is, it will never allow Poland to be affected by it. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is Taking Countermeasures</p>
<p>Rome: Soviet Russian Ambassador to Rome, Potemkin, has departed for Geneva to meet with the Soviet Foreign Affairs Commissioner, Litvinov, before going to Moscow. It is generally believed that the Russian envoy's trip is related to the Four-Power Pact. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Disarmament Conference to Draft a Separate Security Agreement</p>
<p>(Geneva) The matter discussed in today's Disarmament Conference is that after the conclusion of the future disarmament convention, a security agreement will be drafted again to conclude the Disarmament Conference. The draft agreement will include the exclusion of violence, the interpretation of aggressors, and the management of the joint responsibilities that countries should bear when one country is invaded by another and the Council of the League of Nations unanimously decides to enforce the judgment, etc., as stated in the disarmament convention. During the meeting, US Representative Davis raised the issue of whether the exclusion of violence would be applied to the whole world or only to a part of Europe. According to Davis' observation, if such matters can be universally implemented throughout the world as stated in the draft agreement, it would be quite in line with Roosevelt's suggestion. However, Roosevelt also pointed out that the first task of the Disarmament Conference is to establish an agreement for the substantial reduction of armaments. (National dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) Labor Party leader Lansbury made a passionate speech in the House of Commons today, asking the British government to reconsider Foreign Minister Simon's resolution announced at the Geneva Disarmament Conference that Britain would retain sky bombardment for policing purposes, and asking whether the government would not allow its attitude to be changed even if it destroyed the Disarmament Conference. Lord President Baldwin said that the government had made this resolution after repeated consideration, and had notified Parliament of this proposal last November. He could not admit that this resolution could destroy the suggestions of the Disarmament Conference. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Four-Power Pact</h3>
<p>Rome: According to reliable sources, the Four-Power Pact contains an introduction and five or six articles, which mostly stipulate that the signatory states formally agree to maintain peace for ten years, and agree to resolve economic issues. The pact will mention Articles 10, 16, and 19 of the League of Nations Covenant, and recognize the equal rights of the Four Powers on disarmament, but with the understanding that such equal rights will not be implemented temporarily during the agreed time. This pact stipulates the general revision of protective tariffs and the promotion of commercial exchange, and stipulates the period for maintaining peace as ten years. The pact also specifies the method for revising the pact. News from Prague, Czechoslovakia, is that the Administrative Council of the Little Entente countries announced that France's views on the Four-Power Pact can be accepted, because the signatory states are prepared to guarantee the limits of their actions, the continuation of the League of Nations' capacity, and the unanimous implementation of Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant. In addition, France has formally guaranteed that it will not support any modifications based on previously agreed upon provisions. (Reuters dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>Rome: Experts drafting the final draft of the Four-Power Pact today deleted the third clause on disarmament and added new clauses stipulating the modification of the treaty, because the disarmament clauses will be negotiated separately based on the draft disarmament convention proposed by the British Prime Minister, so they were specially deleted. The section on modifying the treaty was advocated by Italy, Britain, and Germany, and after assurances to France that it would not affect the existing positions of the Little Entente and Poland, and that it would be handled entirely through the League of Nations, France agreed. It is now expected that the final draft can be drafted in Rome this afternoon. (National dispatch, 31st)</p>
<h3>The Dispute Over the Definition of "Aggressor Nation"</h3>
<p>France Advocates Natural Application of Sanctions</p>
<p>Britain Shrinks Back, Unwilling to Be Drawn into the Vortex</p>
<p>Seeking a Compromise Solution Again</p>
<p>(Geneva) The issue of defining an "aggressor nation," as a result of the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference's discussions over the past two days, has revealed significant differences of opinion. France and several other countries want a firm and unshakeable definition so that sanctions can be applied naturally in the event of aggression. Britain, on the other hand, wants a more flexible definition so as not to hinder independent judgment and action. Although the United States is not directly involved, it agrees with the British view. The draft resolution proposed by Greek representative Politis for the unreserved handling of this issue has been accepted by French representative Paul-Boncour. Chinese representative Wellington Koo also spoke in support, saying, "In our opinion, this case is a beneficial standard for determining who is the aggressor nation. Currently, there is no fixed provision regarding the definition of an aggressor nation, which leads to complex discussions and the inability to reach an agreement promptly. In cases of aggression, time is an important factor. An agreement on the definition of an aggressor nation would enhance the concept of security, as the aggressor nation would be deterred from acting. It is argued that listing aggressive acts may not be beneficial, as humans are cunning, especially countries that are more strategic. They will evade their actions and adjust their movements so that they can carry out acts of aggression in reality without being labeled as aggressors. If this is the case, a clear article on aggression will not promote international justice and the purpose of world peace, but will instead undermine it. However, according to the Chinese representative, deciding on an article on aggression, even if it is incomplete, is better than having no article at all. For this reason, the Chinese delegation supports the establishment of the second article of the draft concerning the definition of an aggressor nation." German and Hungarian representatives spoke against this draft. Finally, at the suggestion of Chairman Henderson, it was decided to hold a meeting, chaired by Greek representative Politis, with representatives from Britain and Russia, who hold completely opposing views, to seek a compromise solution. (Reuter's dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>Disarmament Conference Discusses Banning Chemical Warfare</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference held only two meetings and completed the first reading of the three chapters of the British disarmament draft. These three chapters are (1) Proof of Aggressive Acts, (2) European Security Treaty, and (3) Prohibition of Chemical Warfare. The General Commission still intends to continue the meeting, but it was stopped by a declaration issued by French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour. Paul-Boncour said that France will submit important amendments to the general provisions of the monitoring system and the disarmament convention tomorrow. It is reported that the amendments France intends to propose will advocate strengthening the restrictions on military expenditure budgets and the supervision of arms manufacturing. During today's discussion, representatives of several countries requested that the Security Treaty be applied to all countries in the world. US representative Davis pointed out that the meaning of prohibiting the use of force can be extended to the whole world, which is in line with the US view. French representative Paul-Boncour expressed France's unreserved support for the draft Security Convention, but said that the main point of the European Security Convention is to conclude a tighter agreement and add mutual assistance in addition to the prohibition of the use of force. The General Commission then discussed Chapter 4 of the British proposal, namely the chapter on the prohibition of chemical warfare. The spokesperson of the Little Entente, Titulescu, with the assistance of Paul-Boncour, argued that chemical warfare should be completely prohibited, without exception, and that retaliation should also be prohibited. If retaliation is necessary in the future, it should be limited to the joint sanctions stipulated in the Disarmament Convention. Chairman Henderson announced that the Presidium will set the agenda for the next few days tomorrow afternoon. Henderson's intention seems to be to ask the Disarmament Conference to continue the meeting, even if it extends to after the opening of the World Economic Conference on June 12, it will not be stopped. This matter was fiercely opposed by several delegations. Soviet Russian representative Litvinov has arrived here. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>The Puppet State Under Japanese Protection</p>
<p>Spit Upon by the Whole World</p>
<p>The League of Nations Plans to Forbid Its Participation in International Sports</p>
<p>Revised Report to Be Submitted for Discussion Next Week</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretariat of the League of Nations today issued the revised draft of the report prepared by the subcommittee on non-recognition of "Manchukuo." This revised draft summarizes and reiterates the original report, and adds one or two paragraphs, such as not allowing representatives of "Manchukuo" to participate in international sports events, such as the Davis Cup tennis tournament. The subcommittee is scheduled to meet on Thursday this week, and it is expected that this revised report will be submitted to the plenary meeting of the Advisory Committee next week. (Reuter's dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The "Manchukuo" authorities are eager to participate in the 1936 Olympic Games to be held in Berlin, but the first step is to have the Olympic Committee recognize "Manchukuo" as an independent country. "Manchu" Prime Minister Zheng Xiaoxu has entrusted Japanese representative Kana, who is attending the Olympic Conference, to find a way to do so. It is reported that the Japanese representative has promised to do his best to help. (Reuter's dispatch, 31st)</p>

(Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin, President Dai, and his party went to Shaanxi at the beginning of the month to inspect the construction of the capital. They left Shaanxi a few days ago and returned to Nanjing. They inspected the Central Plains Cultural and Educational Center and various projects in the capital while passing through Luoyang. They also visited Langya Mountain and Zuiweng Pavilion in Chuzhou. They arrived in Nanjing at 11:00 am on the 30th by car from Chuzhou. A large number of people welcomed them at the station, and the police and military were also on guard at the station. Lin and Dai got off the car and crossed the river, and took a car to the official residence to rest. Chairman Lin told reporters that during this trip to Shaanxi, the disaster in the province was severe and should be relieved. Relief is divided into treating the symptoms and treating the root cause. Speaking of treating the symptoms, there are wailing everywhere in Shaanxi, and it is urgent to remit money for relief. It is also planned that the government will work with the Chinese and foreign charity associations to allocate funds to purchase seeds so that there is hope for the autumn harvest. To treat the root cause, the first priority is to build water conservancy projects. The Jingwei Canal project has been half completed and irrigates thousands of acres of farmland. If it is fully completed, the effect will be even greater. The Koukou Er River should also be dredged as soon as possible. In addition, it is planned to set up grain storage methods, divided into community granaries and official granaries. The second is to cultivate forests to regulate the climate. As for the construction of the capital, during the national crisis, we should strive to be thrifty. We are now surveying streets and developing transportation. The Longhai Railway has been laid to Weinan, and we hope that it will be open to Xi'an within the year. Dai said that the disaster in Shaanxi is very tragic. If relief is not given urgently, the victims will be everywhere and even become uninhabited. The Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College is now actively preparing for the school site, and it is planned to set up the Wugong Central Plains Cultural and Educational Center, which is also actively progressing. I have no other opinions on the current political situation other than hoping that the whole country will unite to overcome the difficulties. It is not yet decided whether I will go to Jiangxi to meet Chiang. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>Our Country Should Have Reservations About Disarmament Bao</h3>
<p>Our Chinese representative declared at the Disarmament Conference, "Our country's coastline is long, and the territory adjacent to its territorial waters is constantly subject to armed invasion by the land, sea, and air forces of aggressor nations. Until the aggressive wars suffered by our country are finally resolved, we will not be subject to any restrictions... and reserve the right to resist aggression and protect our territory... It is regrettable that our belief in the peaceful settlement of international disputes has not been understood by the world." It is indeed regrettable, and it is also regrettable that our people have too much faith in peace and do not strive for their own strength to engage in self-defense of their territory and to protect their sovereignty.</p>
<p>The people of our country have always loved peace, and this historical tradition has a long history. From the late Qing Dynasty to the present, the facts are clear and need no further elaboration. Although the total number of soldiers in our country's army currently exceeds two million, transportation is difficult, and the territory covers an area of more than 34 million square miles. Our country is not like Japan, France, and other countries that use a conscription system. In addition to the standing army, there are also various reserves for military service that can be called upon. Moreover, modern scientific weapons are advancing day by day. Everything from airplanes in the air to tanks on land to long-distance train guns, which are being debated at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, can be used arbitrarily by the Japanese army to kill our people in the Northeast, while our country does not have this kind of equipment. Furthermore, in terms of naval strength, our country's navy is mostly composed of old ships from thirty years ago. Even if new ships are built, their size is very small, and the guns are limited to maintaining the safety of the ship's own navigation. At most, they are used to defend against pirate attacks and act as water police. It can be seen that there is absolutely no preparation for foreign warfare. Therefore, our country's reservation of the "right to protect territorial sovereignty and the right to resist aggression and self-defense" is the most fair and reasonable.</p>
<p>At the same time, while advocating disarmament in Geneva, the Japanese Army Department made a strange statement regarding military operations in North China, boasting that it could seize Beiping and Tianjin in the blink of an eye, and also proposed "If the responsible parties on the Chinese side are sincere in negotiations, the Japanese side will not hesitate to cooperate... but the Japanese army will remain stationed in the area, preparing for both "peace" and "war"... If the peace talks are unsuccessful due to the Chinese side's insincerity or if the war is provoked by inciting actions, the impact will be great. It is thought that the Chinese authorities will fully consider this." Alas, what is this saying? Since the September 18th Incident, who is ultimately responsible for inciting the conflict? There is no need for our people to argue. Even Lord Lytton, a decades-old friend of Japan, has clearly stated this. Uchida's "scorched earth diplomacy" also explained its military policy in another aspect. Therefore, the Japanese so-called "sincerity" is nothing other than that pointed at the tip of the military's spear. In this era when military power is almighty and reason is obliterated, militarists can arbitrarily act rampantly, disregard credibility, and have no regard for anything. However, the subsequent disputes are still unpredictable. For the sake of our country's future and for the sake of world peace, the first thing we must know is that the outcome of international disputes is not like the relationship between personal interests and rewards that can be determined in an instant. It must rely on a considerable period of hard struggle and effort to reverse the decline and save ourselves. Second, we should not be discouraged by the current setbacks. We must know that "three households can destroy Qin / one turn can restore the dynasty." Moreover, although our country is becoming weaker day by day, there are many opportunities for revival. It depends on how hard our people work.</p>
<p>In short, the reduction of armaments is something we wholeheartedly support. However, it is necessary for aggressors to fully reflect on themselves, and for the friendly nations participating in disarmament to be able to actually sanction those who rely solely on military force as a tool of aggression. Then our country should do its best to uphold peace. Otherwise, it is better to reserve the right to self-defense and protect our territory in order to plan for the future of self-rescue.</p>
<h3>The Middle East Railway Problem is Serious, Pseudo-Implements Blockade of Suifenhe Station</h3>
<p>Russian Gunboats Fire on Pseudo-Manchu Vessels</p>
<p>The Pseudo-Regime Actually Changed the Name of the East Railway</p>
<p>(Harbin) Sato, the railway officer of the (pseudo) Manchukuo Railway Department, forcibly sealed off the Suifenhe Station on the Russian-Manchu border at 6:00 am this morning. (Dentsu dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Soviet Russian authorities' detention of cargo trains on the Middle East Railway has not stopped to this day. The (pseudo) Manchukuo Ministry of Transportation is very angry and has decided to cut off the Russian-Manchu connection line in Suifenhe. This blockade will be implemented at 2:00 pm on the 31st. The Ministry of Transportation issued a statement today, saying that Soviet Russia continues to detain cargo trains on the Middle East Railway and transport them into Russian territory. Although the "Manchukuo" has repeatedly warned them, they have not stopped their actions. This attitude of Soviet Russia violates the agreement and is an illegal act of abandoning the Middle East Railway Ussuri connection agreement. "Manchukuo" cannot tolerate this illegal act in the position of jointly operating the Middle East Railway. The Russian-Manchu connection point is now cut off in order to seek the reflection of Soviet Russia. (Japan Allied News dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) According to news from the Manchukuo Ministry of Transportation in Changchun, from June 1, the Middle East Railway will be renamed the "North Manchuria Railway." This is the second discussion by the Ministry of Transportation on the renaming event. The Ministry will immediately notify the Russian Director of the Middle East Railway of the renaming. (Reuter's dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Soviet warships near Tongjiang detained "Manchukuo" ships. The Magistrate of Tongjiang County reported to the authorities here on the 28th, stating (1) that there were several Soviet Russian gunboats patrolling at the intersection of the Songhua River and Heilongjiang River, and (2) that ships traveling between Tongjiang and Boli were fired on or detained by Soviet Russian gunboats. Therefore, the residents of the upstream area lack food and are very poor. (Japan Allied News dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>If Japan Protests the New Tariff Rates</p>
<p>Our Side Decides to Refute</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Foreign news reports that the Japanese government has decided to protest our newly promulgated import tax. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has not yet received the protest letter. According to an official, the Sino-Japanese tariff agreement expired on May 16. Our country has the autonomous right to collect customs duties, and Japan has no right to interfere. Moreover, the tax rate levied by our country on Japanese goods is completely equal to the tax rate levied on goods from other countries. The Japanese government's protest is obviously unreasonable. Furthermore, our country's increase in tax rates is entirely based on the fundamental principle of economic hardship. Since the September 18th Incident, the Japanese army has occupied our four provincial territories, gradually and completely plundering the customs, salt, and postal rights of each province, causing great impact on our country's financial income. However, our payment of foreign debts, such as the Boxer Indemnity, has not been delayed or shortened as a result. Our country has increased tax rates in order to relieve financial difficulties, and this is an unavoidable hardship that should not be interfered with by other countries. Therefore, if Japan protests to us, it will be refuted. (Central News Agency dispatch, 31st)</p>

<h3>Opening of the Economic Conference</h3>
<p>Roosevelt's Instructions to the Delegation</p>
<p>Strive for Currency Stability</p>
<p>And Hope to Stop International Trade Wars</p>
<p>War Debt Issue to be Discussed Outside the Conference</p>
<p>Japan Opposes Moving the Conference to Geneva</p>
<p>(Washington) The US delegation to the World Economic Conference is about to depart for England. President Roosevelt has compiled a series of instructions. According to these instructions, the US delegation should strive for currency stabilization and tariff reduction simultaneously. The US government believes that these two issues are closely related. If currency is stabilized without stopping trade wars, currency stabilization cannot be sustained. Conversely, if currency remains chaotic, signing trade agreements is meaningless. Regarding currency issues, the US delegation should strive to increase the price of silver and adopt a gold and silver bimetallic standard. The White House has stated that news reports regarding Roosevelt's solution to war debts are "purely speculative." Roosevelt does not intend to request full authority from Congress on this matter but plans to take responsibility and resolve it during the congressional recess, seeking congressional ratification afterward. Roosevelt intends to provide significant convenience to debtor nations regarding the war debts due on June 15, the day the World Economic Conference closes on June 12, to alleviate various difficulties. (31st Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, US President Roosevelt denied reports that he intended to use the treaty-making powers granted by Congress to resolve the war debt issue. Congress had authorized the President to negotiate reciprocal trade agreements and adjust tariffs. Recently, newspapers have speculated that Roosevelt would also address the war debt issue when negotiating trade agreements, allowing countries to reduce principal and pay a portion of overdue debts. The White House denied this today, stating that it was purely speculative and that the President has no intention of using this power to modify the war debt. Moreover, apart from negotiating reciprocal trade agreements, all of the President's treaty-making powers are shared with the Senate, which has not yet taken any measures to modify the war debt repayment schedule. Therefore, the war debt issue, under the current circumstances, seems likely to be discussed outside the London Economic Conference, with various proposals and the President's recommendations submitted to Congress for independent decision-making. (30th National News dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The League of Nations Secretariat proposed that the World Economic Conference be moved to Geneva to be held simultaneously with the Disarmament Conference. Japan currently opposes this proposal. Political circles claim that the convocation of the World Economic Conference is to achieve economic relief and has nothing to do with the Disarmament Conference. (30th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<p>Ishii's Radio Address</p>
<p>Pleads Friendship, Seeks US Understanding</p>
<p>Indulges in Arbitrary Attacks on China and Russia</p>
<p>(New York) Ishii, the Japanese delegate to the World Economic Conference, gave a radio address here tonight, praising President Roosevelt as astute and compassionate, resolute and fair, and continuing the traditional friendship between Japan and the United States, unchanged by recent events. He continued to describe the special difficulties in dealing with the situation in the Far East, stating that the forces of corruption and chaos are gradually encroaching upon a region of utmost importance to us, affecting our survival. We must resist them, and we must know that this region is adjacent to a large country whose aim is to destroy all the creeds, organizations, and institutions that you, we, and most of the civilized world deem necessary or even sacred. We must also know that this region is adjacent to another large country where turmoil is the norm, illegality is law, and bad governance is governance. Unfortunately, we are neighbors with these two great powers, and Heaven knows the difficulties of dealing with them. We will continue to deal with them, but the difficulties and incidents are endless. (29th Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>U.S. House Passes Bill Abolishing Gold Standard</h3>
<p>Treasury Secretary Woodin Indicates He Will Remain in Office Temporarily</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (National Telegram). The U.S. Gold Standard Act is expected to be completely abolished before the end of this week. The House of Representatives passed the abolition bill today, and the Senate is also expected to pass it within the next day or two. Once the Gold Standard Act is abolished, the U.S. President can set the price of gold at any time without fear of anyone bringing it to the Supreme Court. According to the final report of the House Banking and Currency Committee, this bill only legalizes the emergency power given to the U.S. President and is not in itself a means of inflating currency. It also stated that abolishing the Gold Standard Act is tantamount to declaring that fulfilling the gold clauses in bonds is contrary to the public interest. Today, the Republican Party argued during the debate that this procedure was unconstitutional, but the Democratic Party responded that the Constitution authorizes Congress to issue currency and set its value, but does not prohibit delegating this power to executive agencies. It is expected that this bill will immediately absorb gold coins hidden by the public, as the value of these gold coins can no longer be higher than any legal currency. As for the composition of gold coins, it will remain the same for the time being, but it may be changed in the future after the President consults with foreign politicians.</p>
<p>Washington, 29th (National Telegram). Friends of U.S. Treasury Secretary Woodin stated today that Woodin does not want to resign during this turbulent period, but will resign from the cabinet after the turbulence subsides.

<h3>U.S. and Russia Exchange Products</h3>

The main U.S. products will be cotton and livestock, while the Soviet Russian products will be manganese, chromium, pulp, and asbestos. Former Senator Brookhart has recently been appointed as a special assistant to the Department of Agriculture to study the possibility of exporting U.S. products to Eastern Europe. According to Brookhart, he will closely monitor trade between the U.S. and Russia. In 1932, the volume of trade between the two countries was only one-tenth of the previous year.</p>
<h3>Gandhi's Fast Breaks Class Discrimination</h3>
<p>Famous Temples Open to Untouchables</p>
<p>Nairobi, East Africa, 29th (Reuters). Today, an Indian temple here allowed untouchables to enter, which is unprecedented in East African history. The doors of the temple were locked by the custodian, but today they were opened to allow a woman from a higher-class Indian family to enter. Then, a large team organized by the Arya Gandhi Association arrived at the temple, including many untouchable men and women, all of whom were invited to enter the temple. Most of the custodians agreed with this unprecedented move, but a few still opposed it. After the untouchables entered the temple, they did not express anything and remained orderly. In addition, an Indian organization held a tea party, where several Indian leaders entertained some untouchables. All of this was moved by Gandhi's fast.</p>
<p>Poona, 30th (Reuters). Gandhi's 21-day fast ended yesterday. Although he is very weak, he was very pleased to receive a telegram today stating that the famous Shiva temple in Rishikesh, India, has now been opened to untouchables. Although Gandhi's fast has ended, he is not yet out of danger and can only take some nourishing substances such as fruit juice and honey water. It is estimated that he will not be able to eat other foods for the next ten days. Doctors examined Gandhi today and forbade him from participating in politics and reading letters.</p>
<h3>Persian Parliament Approves Anglo-Persian Oil Agreement</h3>
<p>Tehran, 30th (Reuters). The Persian Parliament today approved the Anglo-Persian oil agreement. It will take effect after the Persian King signs it. The new agreement allows the oil company to explore oil fields in southwestern Persia, with the area reduced by about half compared to the original. It also stipulates that the company must abandon any parts of the area that it fails to explore by 1938, with the total area not exceeding 100,000 square miles. According to this agreement, the company does not have the exclusive right to install oil pipelines. In addition to paying a tax of four shillings per ton, the company should pay one-fifth of its net profit to the Persian government. If the British exchange rate falls, the company must compensate for the exchange losses. This concession is valid for sixty years, after which Persia can recover all of the company's assets. The company agrees to hire as many Persians as possible and to pay 100,000 pounds of British gold annually for the expenses of Persian students studying engineering in the UK. If the company is willing to liquidate or fails to comply with the provisions of this agreement, the Persian government has the right to cancel this concession, but such cancellation must be notified two years in advance.</p>
<h3>Diplomatic Dispute: Austria Retaliates Against Germany</h3>
<p>Vienna, 30th (Havas). The Austrian government's cold shoulder to German cabinet members visiting Austria has caused a diplomatic dispute between the two countries. Germany has taken retaliatory measures in response, requiring Germans who want to travel to Austria to pay a passport fee of 1,000 marks, as a way of imposing a prohibition through taxation. This law has been announced and will take effect on June 1st. Various Austrian ministries have jointly formed an economic committee to study countermeasures. This afternoon, the committee drafted various proposals, such as (1) Austrians traveling to Germany must have passports, (2) Restrictions will be placed on German imports to make their quantity equal to Austrian exports to Germany.</p>
<h3>Japanese Reporter Explores the Mystery of the Volcano Bottom</h3>
<p>Tokyo, 30th (Japan United Press). The recent suicides at Mount Mihara on Izu Oshima have caused people to have a mysterious sense of terror. The Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun has decided to explore the mystery of the bottom of the crater and has been making concrete preparations since the end of April. On the 4th, animals such as monkeys and rabbits were lowered into the crater to conduct animal experiments. The results proved that the human body could be lowered to 1,000 feet. Therefore, the deputy chief of the social department, Iwata Tokunosuke, the photography department chief, Magara Toku, and Westerners formed an expedition team and stayed near Mount Mihara to study the weather every day. On the 29th, all preparations were completed, and this unprecedented adventure was carried out at 2:30 p.m. The wind speed was 7 meters per second that day, and the weather was quite clear. Department Chief Iwata entered the crater and descended to a position of 1,250 feet, where he discovered a dead body of a suicide victim. After inspecting the tragic eruption situation inside the crater, he came out safely. Next, Photography Department Chief Magara descended and photographed many desolate scenes.</p>
<h3>North China Peace Talks in Progress: Central Government Leaders Hold Important Meeting in Lushan</h3>
<p>Wang, Sun, Luo, Huang, and Others Arrive in Lushan One After Another to Meet Chiang</p>
<p>Concrete Decisions Made on Domestic and Foreign Policies</p>
<p>Jiujiang Communication. Since Huang Fu arrived in Ping, a truce atmosphere has permeated the country. The authorities believe that this matter is of great importance and must be handled with caution. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, who is fully responsible for military affairs, could not return to Nanjing due to the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi. Therefore, he arranged to meet with various leaders in Lushan to discuss everything. Chiang arrived in Xun from Nanchang a few days ago and immediately ascended Lushan. Premier Wang Jingwei, President of the Legislative Yuan Sun Ke, Foreign Minister Luo Wengan, Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan, Education Minister Wang Shijie, Secretary-General of the Central Political Committee Tang Youren, Vice Minister of Railways Zeng Zhongming, and a group of seven people took the Chu You warship west from Nanjing on the 27th and arrived in Xun on the 28th to climb the mountain. That evening, they discussed all major domestic and foreign policies and the military and political issues in North China. The general points include: (1) Hangzhou-Japan military affairs, (2) Central government's support and response methods for the situation in North China in the midst of the Pingjin crisis, (3) Diplomacy after the truce, (4) Joint military plans with the Southwest to suppress the Communists on a large scale and funding issues, (5) The upcoming convocation of the Provisional National Congress, planning important proposals, and explaining to the Southwest to promote their unanimous participation, (6) All important issues related to the Central government's current domestic affairs, foreign affairs, and finance. On the 29th, Interior Minister Huang Shaoxiong also arrived by plane to join the discussions. It is said that decisions have been made on everything, generally based on the Central government's established policies to respond calmly. Wang and others are unable to stay for long due to their busy national affairs and are scheduled to return to Nanjing by the Chu You warship on the 30th. (29th)</p>
<p>Another communication. After returning to Nanjing from Beiping, Interior Minister Huang Shaoxiong flew from Nanjing to Jiangxi by plane at 10:00 a.m. on the 29th. Before Huang came to Jiangxi, he received news that Wang, Sun, and Chiang were going to meet in Lushan. Therefore, when he flew to Jiujiang, he originally planned to land at the Xun airport. However, due to the deep accumulation of water at the airport, there was a risk of danger when landing. So, he drove directly to Nanchang and landed safely at the airport outside Shunhua Gate at 1:35 p.m. Few people knew about it beforehand, so there were not many welcomers. Only the headquarters received a phone call and sent people to take care of everything at the airport. After getting off the plane, Huang immediately took a car prepared by the headquarters and rushed to the ferry, took the Naxun Road transport across the river, and transferred to a Naxun Road special car to Xun to rush to Lushan, arriving at around 6:00 p.m. He immediately met with Presidents Wang and Sun and Chairman Chiang to report on the situation in North China and the recent military actions of the Japanese and puppet forces. That evening, various leaders in Lushan, at Chiang's residence in Guling, held lengthy consultations on important issues such as Sino-Japanese negotiations, Communist suppression, and the Provisional National Congress, in order to formulate a response plan after returning to Nanjing. As for whether the leaders will leave Lushan tomorrow, there is no confirmed news yet. (29th)</p>
<h3>Decision on Representatives for Sino-Japanese Ceasefire Negotiations</h3>
<p>Our Main Personnel are Xiong Bin</p>
<p>Location Decided at China Merchants Bureau in Tanggu</p>
<p>Difficult Issues Still in Negotiation</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping. Since the four principles were agreed upon on the morning of the 23rd, both sides have begun to proceed accordingly. The first step is to implement an actual ceasefire. Both sides sent representatives to the agreed location to discuss in detail the provisional defense areas of the two armies and all ceasefire procedures. On the 25th, it was completely completed. The representatives of both sides expressed their satisfaction in an oral form, shook hands with each other, and the ceremony was completed. After this step was completed, the troops of both sides withdrew to the appropriate locations and implemented the ceasefire. In recent days, more in-depth negotiations have been underway, and everything is going smoothly. Yesterday (28th), there was an important meeting in Ju Ren Tang. Except for Yu Xuezhong, who was unable to arrive due to busy government affairs, Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, Pang Bingxun, Fu Zuoyi, Wan Fulin, Zhang Qun, Jiang Bocheng, and others all attended. Huang Fu personally discussed with everyone and generally reached a conclusion. Military affairs are still emphasized in dealing with Japan. The first step is to resolve the war issue, and diplomacy and politics will not be involved for the time being. Within the next few days, military personnel from Japan will jointly discuss ceasefire steps. The Japanese side initially suggested that the negotiation location be in Qinhuangdao, while the Chinese side considered Tanggu to be appropriate. After several consultations, the Japanese side finally agreed, and the meeting place was decided to be at the Tanggu China Merchants Bureau. Both sides have each appointed six representatives. It is said that the main personnel on our side is Mr. Xiong Bin, and the Japanese side is Mr. Okamura. Both are military personnel. Okamura is currently serving in the Army Headquarters, participating in military affairs, and is Koiso's deputy. Regarding the ceasefire measures, he will be based on Mutō's orders. The cessation of hostilities will inevitably involve detailed discussions. Japanese Ambassador Arima will arrive in Ping from Shanghai within the next few days, but will not attend the meeting. He is only an advisor, and his mission is only to report everything to the Japanese government.</p>
<p>Today (29th), Huang, He, and military and political leaders such as Jiang Bocheng and Zhang Qun held another meeting in Fengze Garden to discuss all issues in more detail. There are many difficulties in these peace negotiations: (1) The Japanese side has never forgotten the recognition of Manchuria and directly demands that our country recognize it, which is difficult to do. It is feared that they will use roundabout methods to reveal this intention and may ask to add the words "Japanese troops withdraw to the Manchurian border" in the withdrawal text in the future. If we do not pay attention and rashly sign, it will be tantamount to disguised recognition of Manchuria. (2) Even if the "Manchurian State" is not specified in the withdrawal text, if the Japanese and Manchurian armies are used together, it will be tantamount to disguised demand for recognition of Manchuria. (3) Since the Japanese army invaded the mainland on a large scale, it has bought a large number of traitors and organized puppet troops to make trouble in the mainland. The aftermath of these puppet troops is very difficult. (4) In order to ensure the safety of their military occupation areas, the Japanese side has made extravagant demands on the scope of the demilitarized zone. All of these are extremely difficult issues in the peace negotiations and require careful consideration. The front-line war has subsided since the 24th. Tongzhou and Shunyi have each withdrawn several miles to avoid conflicts. Although the puppet army in eastern Tianjin is still active, it is not very strong. Today, the front line is very peaceful. The Japanese army in Tongzhou is still stationed in the areas of Xixia and Yanxiao, more than 30 miles away from Tongzhou County. Most of our army is west of Tongzhou, and only a small number of troops are stationed in the city, confronting each other. In Shunyi, the Japanese army is stationed north of Niulanshan, and our army is defending Shunyi and both sides, without any movement. In Lutai, the Japanese army is in the Yangshizhuang area, and the Japanese army east of the Ninghe River is in the Miaojiazhuang area. Our army is still stationed in its original position. As for the plainclothes team found north of Langfang and Luobao, it is the disruptive behavior of the puppet army and has nothing to do with the overall situation.</p>
<p>The internal organization of the Executive Yuan's Beiping Political Affairs Consolidation Committee has been completed. It was originally scheduled to be formally established on June 1st, but because the time is too short and the preparations are insufficient, it is expected to be established before June 10th. Huang Shaoxiong rushed to Nanjing the day before yesterday to visit Wang, Luo, and others to report on the recent situation in North China. When he arrived in Nanjing, he learned that Wang and others had already gone to Jiangxi. Huang also went to Jiangxi to participate in the meeting. It is expected that the opening day of the Political Affairs Consolidation Committee will be after Huang returns north. As for the important generals in North China, they will also attend the routine meeting of the Military Affairs Branch on Wednesday this week to discuss military matters. The Japanese planes did not arrive in Beiping today (29th). The Japanese aircraft carrier Notoro, which was anchored outside Dagukou, set sail on the evening of the 27th. (May 29th)</p>
<h3>After Feng Yuxiang Issued a Circular Telegram</h3>
<p>The Delays on the Ping-Sui Railway Caused by the Impact of Inspection</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping. After Feng Yuxiang, who had been living in Zhangjiakou for a long time, took office as the Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army, he issued a circular telegram detailing his personal views. His headquarters has begun to be organized, headed by Ji Hongchang. Feng also sent Liu Zhizhou, the former Governor of Shaanxi Province, to Tianjin on the 29th to explain the anti-Japanese process in the circular telegram to the generals to avoid misunderstandings. The generals all took a serious attitude and have not yet expressed their opinions. According to a member of the Central Committee in Beiping, Mr. Feng's anti-Japanese circular telegram and self-appointment as the Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Japanese Allied Army are admirable for his patriotism. However, Mr. Feng holds an important position in the Central Committee and still uses the name of the people to resist Japan, which is thought-provoking. Its impact is difficult to predict. As for the participation of Fang Zhenwu and Liu Guitang, this may be possible, etc. It is also heard that after Mr. Feng took office, in addition to making some arrangements in the military, he also appointed Tong Lin'ge as the Chairman of the Chahar Provincial Government and Ji Hongchang as the Commander of the Chahar Garrison and the Director of the Public Security Bureau. The transportation between Ping and Chahar was once obstructed but has been restored immediately and is still normal. However, the inspection north of Xuanhua is stricter, and all parties are paying close attention to Feng's actions this time. Last night, a meeting was convened in Ju Ren Tang to discuss the defense areas of the various armies in the future and the issue of Mr. Feng. As for the obstruction of the Ping-Sui Railway, the general situation is as follows: The Ping-Sui Railway was once obstructed a few days ago, and all passenger trains were delayed. The second train to Xizhimen, which should have arrived at 3:20 p.m. on the 29th, was delayed for two hours. The Pingbao special express train, which should have arrived at the Qianmen Railway Station at 11:00 a.m. on the 29th, only passed Nankou at 7:00 p.m. and arrived in Ping at about 10:00 p.m., delayed for as long as ten hours. The situation along the way is normal. Zhangjiakou and Xuanhua strictly inspect passengers. The Zhangyuan area is peaceful, but the railway station is plastered with Feng Yuxiang's inauguration announcements. The Ping-Sui Railway Bureau previously sent Chen Hongbin, the assistant of the Transportation Department, to Datong to arrange the relocation of the head office, but he has not yet returned to Ping. Shen Chang, the Chairman of the Purchasing Committee of the Ministry of Railways, arrived in Ping from Nanjing a few days ago to meet with Huang Fu, the Chairman of the Political Affairs Consolidation Committee stationed in Ping, to discuss official business. According to Shen, he was ordered to go north to handle the purchasing affairs of the Ministry of Railways and to contact the state-owned railways of various countries to draw purchasing funds. The rumors that he came north to take over the position of Director of the Ping-Sui Railway Bureau are purely rumors. (30th)</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu's Remarks on the Current Situation</h3>
<p>Resist Strong Enemies Externally and Suppress Bandits Internally</p>
<p>No Other Claims Made</p>
<p>Jinan Communication. The Pingjin ceasefire negotiations are in progress, and Chiang and Cai issued circular telegrams before, and Feng Yuxiang issued circular telegrams after, all using opposition to the ceasefire as a slogan. Moreover, the transportation between Ping and Zhang was once interrupted, so rumors abounded and people's hearts were shaken. The future of North China does not seem to be optimistic. The reporter specially visited the Chairman of the Provincial Government, Han Fuqu, today to ask for his opinion on the current situation. I was granted an audience, and the conversation was as follows (below is the reporter's questions and Han's answers): Question: Have you seen Feng's circular telegram? Answer: Yes, I have. Question: What are your opinions? Answer: I dare not comment. Question: Have representatives from all parties come? Answer: Many people come and go, but they just meet and talk casually. Question: What is Shandong's attitude? Answer: All parties attach great importance to Shandong. In fact, Shandong can only do its best to maintain local security and dare not express any attitude towards all parties. Question: What happened to the 19th Route Army after they arrived in Hunan? Answer: The 19th Route Army has passed through Chenzhou and is very welcomed by the locals. Rumors are not credible. Question: Have you seen Chiang and Cai's circular telegram? Answer: I saw a brief excerpt, only saying opposition to compromise, etc. I have no opinion to express on this either. Question: How will the Central Government respond to this? Answer: I think they are planning response measures. Question: Negotiations or force? Answer: I don't know. Question: How will Shandong respond to this situation? Answer: Shandong has preparations, resisting strong enemies externally and suppressing bandits internally, with no other opinions. Question: What are the basic armies of Feng's Anti-Japanese Allied Army? Answer: Fang Zhenwu's troops, Sun Dianying's troops, Feng Zhanhai's troops, etc. Question: What about Song Zheyuan, Shang Zhen, etc.? Answer: I'm not clear. Question: Can the situation in Pingjin be temporarily considered better? Answer: It seems that it can be temporarily considered better. Question: Are there any changes in Shandong Province's internal politics and military affairs? Answer: Everything is as usual. (May 30th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>Wedding Guests Mishandle Gun, Causing Disaster</p>
<p>Peng Qifu, a local villager in the 15th and 16th districts of Xin Zhuang, was a member of the local defense corps. He held a wedding on the 26th, and the guests gathered, making it a grand occasion. The next day, the newlyweds returned home, and the wedding guests had not yet dispersed. Someone, Peng Yuhou, and other relatives, motivated by curiosity, dismantled and inspected the gun of the defense corps. Unexpectedly, there was a bullet left in the chamber. When the mechanism was accidentally moved, the bullet fired and hit the abdomen of a female guest, Ma Yingdi. The bullet passed through her abdomen, and blood flowed like a river. Her injuries were quite serious. Her family accompanied her to Shanghai for treatment at the Tongde Hospital. It is said that she is still in danger.</p>
<h3>Editor of the People's Daily Acquitted</h3>
<p>The case of the construction of a monument to the general manager in Ximen Yuecheng has caused disputes among local people. After the provincial government decided to move the monument to Zhongshan Park, the original monument construction site in Ximen Yuecheng was reserved for future public construction, and the county was ordered to preserve it and announce it. Later, Wu Boyang built a fence there. The People's Daily, organized by the local county party headquarters, accused him of disobeying orders and acting like a local bully. After the county government ordered the Public Security Bureau to strictly limit Wu's removal, Wu believed that Yang Yunwen, the editor of the People's Daily, defamed his reputation and filed a lawsuit in the county court, requesting legal action and attaching a private lawsuit to compensate for the loss of reputation. Later, he also prosecuted Ye Dingchu, the county executive member and president of the People's Daily, for the crime of inciting defamation. This afternoon (31st) at 2:00 p.m., Judge Zhang Yihuang of the court summoned both parties for interrogation. The plaintiff Wu Boyang stated the intention of the lawsuit, and the defendant hired lawyers Yang Heng and Gu Shouyi to appear in court to defend him. Regarding the point of the local bully in the article, it was said that the plaintiff knew the provincial order and still built a fence, disobeying the order, which was beyond doubt. After the county ordered its removal, it can be seen that the construction of the fence was illegal. The plaintiff's lawsuit is groundless, etc. Both parties argued vigorously and endlessly. After the interrogator ordered the debate to end, he declared Ye Dingchu and Yang Yunwen not guilty and withdrew.</p>
<h3>Suzhou</h3>
<p>Two Shops in Huguan Town Robbed</p>

They robbed separately and fired a shot when they left, heading towards the railway. After inspection, the loss was about 100 yuan. They immediately reported to the waterway police team to pursue the robbers, but there was no trace of them.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Joint Conference of the Silk Cocoon Industry</p>
<p>Tan Xihong, the Director of the Land Reclamation Department of the Ministry of Industry, believes that Wuxi is the richest cocoon-producing area in Jiangsu Province. Now that new cocoons are on the market, at a time when the rural economy is extremely depressed and silk cocoons have failed for years, it is necessary to conduct inspections and investigations. He specially invited Dong Xiujia, the Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, to come to Wuxi at 1:00 p.m. on the 30th. He telegraphed the two silk cocoon trade associations in advance to convene the industry to hold a joint conference to consult on matters. After Director Tan and Director Dong arrived in Wuxi, they first had a conversation with County Chief Yan Zuoyi and then participated in the silk cocoon industry conference. More than 40 industry leaders attended that day. Chairman Hua Shaochun first reported the reasons for the failure of silk cocoons in Wuxi, which was the opening of cocoon shops. There are now 368 cocoon shops in Wuxi County that have joined the association, and there are also more than 100 that have not joined the association, totaling more than 500. However, there is not much silk cocoon production, so the supply and demand cannot correspond, which has led to difficulties for both farmers and merchants. The opening of the new cocoon market was decided by this conference to be on June 1st. Unexpectedly, a few merchants, under the pretext of testing the reeling yield, took the liberty of starting earlier, having already opened the market three days ago. As for the cocoon price, according to the original plan decided by the Silk Industry Unified Committee, it was agreed to be 35 yuan for improved varieties and 25 yuan for local varieties based on the European and American silk markets. Now, it has been repeatedly reported that some shops that have opened the market have released prices of up to 45 and 50 yuan. Such destruction of the agreed rules is obviously intentional disruption and should be discussed at length, and the government should punish those who disrupt the overall situation as a warning to others. After Director Tan, Director Dong, and the two county chiefs expressed their opinions successively, and the silk cocoon industry had detailed consultations, the results of the discussions were as follows: (A) Cocoon price issue: (1) Because the weather in Wuxi is good and the reeling yield is shorter, the highest price for improved varieties of new cocoons is approved to be 40 yuan. (2) If there is any release of prices or scales, once verified, a request will be made to the government to immediately revoke the shop license, and all losses of the shop owner will be borne by the operating merchants. (B) Opening date: (1) According to the conference decision, it will be June 1st. No opening will be allowed on the 31st. The industry attending the meeting today will be responsible for complying with this and request the County Government Public Security Bureau to telegraph each branch to strictly investigate. If anyone opens the market without authorization, they will be ordered to stop. Those who do not comply will have their cocoon scales reported to the County Bureau for punishment. (2) If the industry discovers that neighboring shops are opening the market ahead of schedule, they can only advise them to stop and cannot blindly follow. If they do not comply, they will report to the association and forward the report to the County Government for punishment.</p>

<p>Cocoon Industry Association Holds General Meeting</p>
<p>The Wuyi Cocoon Industry Association, with the upcoming fresh cocoon season, specifically convened a general meeting of all members at approximately 1:00 PM on the 29th. Forty-five cocoon trading firms reported their presence. The meeting was chaired by Zhao Songping, and the following matters were discussed: (1) It was resolved that each cocoon trading firm should first register with the Business Tax Bureau, obtain a certificate for verification, and simultaneously register with the association for record-keeping and future coordination. (2) It was resolved that each firm should purchase and use stamp tax independently from the Stamp Tax Bureau. (3) It was resolved that the opening date for purchasing would be June 1st. (4) It was resolved that the price of cocoons would be set at thirty-five to forty yuan per dan (unit of weight) for improved varieties and twenty-five to thirty yuan per dan for local varieties.</p>
<p>Robbery Occurs in Suburban Area</p>
<p>At approximately 10:00 PM on the 28th, a group of armed bandits suddenly raided the residence of Bai Kun, located at Baijia Bridge, Xiatang, east of Wuyi city.

<p>Notorious Thieves Apprehended in the Fifteenth District</p>
<p>Zhou Daonan, an assistant officer in the Fifteenth District of Wuyi, learned on the 29th that bandits were hiding near Lüshi Bridge. He led district guards and the local defense corps to the area. Zhou moved ahead and encountered the notorious bandit Yang Zhengda near Benniu. He immediately seized Yang and brought him to the district office. Under interrogation by District Chief Zhang Renhe, Yang confessed to several crimes and implicated accomplices, including Li Jinsheng. Subsequently, Li Jinsheng was also captured. He admitted to participating in robberies of boats at Sanli'an and Yangqiao, among other places. The two criminals were handed over to the county authorities on the 31st for interrogation and legal proceedings.</p>

<h3>Hangzhou</h3>
<p>Murder Case at Zhendong Building</p>
<p>Song Baofu, a 28-year-old resident of No. 44 Zhendong Building in Hangzhou, originally from Shaoxing. His wife, Li, was only nineteen years old. Song himself was serving as a captain in the Fenghua Defense Corps. His wife lived with her mother, Li Xu. Lü Guanzhe, a 35-year-old man from Sheng County and a close friend of Song, was an official in the surveying team of the Department of Civil Affairs. Since Song was not often at home, Lü frequently visited under the guise of checking in. He engaged in an affair with Li, which had lasted for over a year. Recently, Lü heard rumors that Song's wife had formed a new relationship. Consumed by jealousy, he went to Song's house on the evening of the 30th to spend the night. At around 5:00 AM yesterday (the 31st), he secretly took a kitchen knife from the kitchen and, while Song's wife was fast asleep, struck her head with a fierce blow. The woman, in extreme pain, woke up and cried out as she tried to escape. Lü then wildly slashed at her head, arms, hands, and chest more than a dozen times. The woman immediately collapsed in a pool of blood. Neighbors heard the commotion and promptly reported it to the police station. Police officers rushed to the scene. The perpetrator, realizing that he could not escape the law, repeatedly struck his own head with the kitchen knife, causing blood to flow profusely. Patrol Officer Zhou Chunshou urgently sent the injured to the nearby Gulou Hospital for treatment. Doctors stated that Song's wife was in critical condition due to severe injuries and excessive blood loss. Lü's injuries were relatively minor. Ke Shiming, an officer from the Second Division of the First District, briefly questioned Lü, who confessed to the crime of passion. He was then transferred to the Hangzhou District Court for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Suicide by Drowning After Prolonged Illness</p>
<p>Zhu Yutang, a shop assistant at the former Xinkang Shoe Store in Hangzhou, suffered from typhoid fever for a long time without recovery. With a poor family background, he became despondent about his life. On the afternoon of the 30th, at 1:00 PM, he secretly threw himself into a well. He was discovered and rescued, still showing faint signs of life. He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment, but it was too late to revive him. The store manager, Yun Duansheng, provided a coffin and prepared the body for burial.</p>

On the 26th of this month, at around 3:00 PM, they encountered the pirates east of Jinmao Port. A fierce exchange of fire ensued, lasting until 3:00 AM on the 27th, when the bandits finally lost ground and fled in disarray. Four pirates were killed on the spot, and one wounded pirate, Lin Erdi, was captured. The police also seized three quick-firing rifles, one Mauser rifle, one carbine, and one wooden-holster pistol.

<h3>On the Different Views Regarding the Ceasefire in North China</h3>
<p>City Chamber of Commerce Sends Telegram of Advice</p>
<p>Central Government and Provinces Should Prepare for a Last Stand</p>
<p>Do Not Engage in Empty Accusations and Mutual Blame</p>
<p>In response to the recent debates regarding the ceasefire in North China, the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce sent a special telegram of advice. The telegram reads: "To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Military Affairs Commission, the Guangzhou Southwest Political Committee, the Peiping Military Affairs Commission Branch, the Fuzhou Fujian Provincial Government, Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong, and Mr. Feng Huanzhang in Chahar. Recent discussions regarding the ceasefire in North China have sparked varying viewpoints, leading to widespread rumors and anxieties, creating a 'boiling beans' scenario where people are uncertain and fearful. Our country boasts a military force of over two million, with only about twenty divisions tied down by military engagements in Jiangxi Province. If all parties can prioritize the overall situation and promptly send reinforcements north, how could the battles at the various passes of the Great Wall have resulted in such a disadvantageous situation, surrendering thousands of miles east of the Liao River to the enemy? The current ceasefire issue stems from this situation. Both the front lines and the rear guard should bear their respective responsibilities. At this time, the Central Government and various provinces should earnestly prepare for a last stand should negotiations fail. Empty accusations and mutual blame should be avoided. During the late Ming Dynasty, with the Qing army poised to cross the river, Zuo Liangyu was still raising troops in the upper reaches, leading to internal strife and the eventual collapse of the dynasty. This historical lesson is a clear warning for today. To repeat this would leave the people with nowhere to die. We respectfully offer this advice, hoping for your consideration. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce bows in respect."</p>
<h3>Two Important Telegrams from the University Federation</h3>
<p>Telegraph to Huang Fu: Negotiations Must Not Involve Politics</p>
<p>Request National Government to Severely Punish Traitors Disrupting Peace in Tianjin and Peiping</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Students' Federation telegraphed Huang Fu yesterday, stating that negotiations must not involve politics. They also telegraphed the National Government, requesting that it not accept conditions that would cede sovereignty and humiliate the nation, and that it severely punish the traitors who are disrupting peace and security in Tianjin and Peiping. The original telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>To Huang Fu, Chairman of the Peiping Administrative Yuan's Resident Political Affairs Committee, Peiping: The current ceasefire negotiations in Tianjin and Peiping are purely a temporary and local military issue and must not involve permanent and comprehensive political matters. Therefore, the content of the negotiations should absolutely adhere to this standard. We hope you will uphold this principle, strive for resolution, not sign humiliating conditions, and not make any agreements that would lead to the destruction of our country. The students of Shanghai pledge their support. The Shanghai University Students' Federation bows in respect.</p>
<p>Telegram to the National Government, Nanjing:</p>
<p>The enemy has penetrated deeply and is now at its limit. Only active resistance can secure our survival. Although the current ceasefire negotiations in Tianjin and Peiping are limited to local military matters and do not involve political conditions, this does not impede the future of resistance against Japan. However, the intentions of the Japanese invaders are unpredictable. Whether it is peace or war, we must be fully prepared to have a chance of victory. As for the traitors who are disturbing the peace and security of Tianjin and Peiping, they are acting as accomplices for the enemy and their crimes are unforgivable. They must be severely punished to uphold the law and prevent further chaos. We earnestly hope for this. The Shanghai University Students' Federation bows in respect.</p>
<p>Commemoration of the May 30th Incident Held the Day Before Yesterday</p>
<p>City Party Headquarters Convened a Commemorative Meeting</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM on the 30th, the Shanghai City Party Headquarters convened a commemorative meeting for the eighth anniversary of the May 30th Massacre in the auditorium on the third floor of the City Party Headquarters. Executive Committee member Lu Jingshi presided over the meeting. The Second District Police Station dispatched a team of police officers to provide security at the venue. The meeting adjourned at 11:00 AM.</p>
<p>Commemorative Ceremony</p>
<p>(1) All stood in solemn silence. (2) The Party anthem was sung. (3) The national flag and the portrait of the Founding Father were saluted with the highest respect. (4) The chairman reverently recited the Founding Father's last will and testament. (5) Three minutes of silence were observed to commemorate the martyrs of the May 30th Incident. (6) The chairman gave a report. (7) Speeches were delivered. (8) Slogans were chanted. (9) The ceremony concluded.</p>
<p>Participating Representatives: Li Zemin from the City Public Security Bureau, Zhang Menglin from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ma Jiazhen from the City Education Association, Jiang Zongjian from the Jianghai Customs Superintendent Office, Lu Bolian from the Shanghai Branch of National Medicine, Zhu Xuefan from the General Labor Union, Zhang Huichun from the Shanghai South District Farmers' Association, and over three hundred people from various schools, Party branches at all levels, and people's organizations.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Lu Jingshi reported, in brief, that the remote cause of the May 30th Massacre was China's subjugation to unequal treaties. Its immediate cause was the unprecedented oppression of the Chinese people by the collusion of imperialists. However, although the May 30th Incident resulted in the sacrifice of many people, the internal strife among warlords prevented it from achieving victory. This infighting was backed by imperialism, which relied on unequal treaties to encourage this internal strife. Therefore, to escape the oppression of imperialism, we must unite to abolish unequal treaties, etc.</p>
<p>Commemorative Slogans</p>
<p>(1) The spirit of the May 30th martyrs will never die! (2) Down with Japanese imperialism!</p>
<p>(3) Eliminate the Chinese Communist Party! (4) Long live the Chinese Nationalist Party! (5) Long live the Republic of China!</p>
<h3>Conclusion of the City's Aviation Fundraising Drive</h3>
<p>Total Amount Raised Exceeds 1,390,000 Yuan</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association's fundraising drive in Shanghai, which began in early March, was originally scheduled to end at the end of April. Due to the results not meeting the target, the deadline was extended by one month. On the afternoon of the day before yesterday, at 5:00 PM, a concluding report was made at the Youth Association Building on the ninth floor of the Bāxiānqiáo. Over forty people attended, including Wu Tiecheng, Lin Kanghou, Yu Hongjun, Lin Wojiang, Wang Xiaoying, Zheng Tonghe, Wu Shan, and Li Dachao. Mayor Wu chaired the meeting, and the total amount raised was reported as 1,394,870 yuan, 9 jiao, 1 fen, 1 li. Although the fundraising drive has concluded, donations will continue to be accepted. At the end of the meeting, Lin Kanghou, representing the Aviation Association, thanked the general team leaders and the team leaders for fundraising before it adjourned. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Wu, the General Team Leader, stated in his address: "Today marks the conclusion of the China Aviation Association's fundraising drive in Shanghai. The total amount raised in three months is 1,394,870 yuan, 9 jiao, 1 fen, 1 li. Although this only amounts to two-thirds of the original target, this achievement is commendable given the current circumstances. This is due to the enthusiastic efforts of the fundraising team leaders and members in supporting the national defense plan. The China Aviation Association has already ordered eighteen Hawk fighter planes from the United States and donated them to the government. One plane has already arrived and will be named on June 1st in Jiangwan. We hope that all team leaders and members will actively participate. The remaining seventeen planes will arrive in the next three months of June, July, and August. The naming rights will be given to organizations or individuals who have donated over 100,000 yuan, and the order of priority will be determined by the speed of payment. Although the fundraising team has concluded its work today, donations will continue to be accepted, partly because many wealthy families and influential organizations in Shanghai are enthusiastic about national defense and will continue to be asked to donate, and partly because the value of the eighteen fighter planes, even with 2,000,000 yuan raised, is still insufficient. Therefore, we still need to continue to solicit donations."</p>

<h3>Yu Hongjun Discusses Autonomy Preparation</h3>
<p>Retrenchment is Temporary, Slightly Relieving Financial Strength</p>
<p>The Situation is Slightly Stable, Actively Proceeding</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Shanghai Municipal Autonomy Preparatory Committee, after being ordered to retrench following the 236th municipal administration meeting of the Municipal Government last week, caused many outside to be unclear about the truth, leading to much speculation, with some even saying that this retrenchment meant suspension of the committee. Opinions differed, and no consensus was reached. For this reason, this reporter went to the Municipal Government to interview Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, who kindly spoke in detail. Mr. Yu's remarks are recorded below. The preparations for local autonomy in various provinces and cities are a crucial task that the central government has limited time to complete during the tutelage period. Shanghai's special status is of great importance. Since receiving the central government's order in the 19th year (of the Republic), the city first established the Shanghai Municipal Local Autonomy Training Institute to cultivate a large number of specialized autonomy talents for local use. At the same time, the Shanghai Municipal Government's Municipal District Division Committee was established to investigate the city's district boundaries, dividing the 13 administrative districts into 40 autonomous districts. After years of work, the foundation for autonomy was completed. Subsequently, the city was planning to continue carrying out household surveys and dividing neighborhoods to facilitate the election of autonomy officials at all levels, but the January 28th Incident happened at that time. The Municipal Government's established steps had to be temporarily suspended. When the Shanghai war ended in May of last year and an agreement was reached, the Municipal Government, on July 1st of the same year, organized the Shanghai Municipal Autonomy Preparatory Committee to take charge of the unfinished matters of the previous District Division Committee. The former District Division Committee was only in charge of the district division, which was the beginning of the autonomy preparation. The Autonomy Preparatory Committee is responsible for the entire preparation task. The complexity is self-evident. Therefore, the organization was specially augmented to facilitate progress. Within a month of the committee's establishment, all the articles of association were drafted and reported, and the entire preparation was divided into three periods: preparation, investigation, and election. From July 1st of last year to June 31st of this year, within one year, the city's autonomy preparation was to be completed, and the elected district offices and all levels of autonomous organs of the municipal organization law were to be established. In July of last year, when the January 28th Incident had just ended in the city and the local area suffered greatly, the Municipal Government established the committee amid efforts to prepare for local post-war recovery and relief, showing its emphasis on the matter and its willingness to do its utmost. The original plan submitted by the committee stipulated that the district offices should be established by August 31st of last year. At that time, the selection of district chiefs and the Municipal Government's financial resources were not something that could be done hastily. Therefore, it was delayed until December of last year that the appointed district chiefs were approved by the Ministry of Interior and reported to the Executive Yuan for record. Then the committee re-planned and decided to start the organization from January 1st of this year, postponing the original deadline for the establishment of the district offices by half a year. Unexpectedly, before long, the war in North China suddenly broke out. The whole country was affected by the increasing foreign aggression, even in daily administration. How much more so for this important autonomy task, which was hoped for by both the upper and lower levels and related to the foundation of Shanghai for generations to come? How could it be done hastily in the midst of this national crisis? This was due to the circumstances, and it was necessary to wait for an opportunity to proceed. In the middle of last month, the Municipal Government, due to the current lack of financial resources and the impact of the situation, which would not be easy to recover in the short term, received a request from the committee for instructions, which was submitted to the 236th Municipal Administration Meeting. It was decided to temporarily retrench, and at the same time report to the Executive Yuan for approval. The purpose of the retrenchment was only to reduce the expenses of the committee and slightly relieve the financial resources, while the Autonomy Preparatory Committee would still exist, and the members would continue to plan. On the one hand, they would quietly wait for instructions from the Executive Yuan. In short, the Municipal Government has long been determined to quickly complete the preparation for local autonomy in Shanghai, as can be seen from the efforts to establish the Autonomy Preparatory Committee after the war last year. As long as the circumstances permit, every effort will be made. As for empty talk and wild speculation, that is not known.</p>

<h3>The Extraterritorial Road Construction Case Will Have New Developments</h3>
<p>The Specific Nature is Still Unclear</p>
<p>Guowen News Agency reports: The extraterritorial roads built by the Public Concession had been negotiated for recovery last year by Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of our Municipal Government, and Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Works Department, and there was hope for a solution. However, due to obstruction from the Japanese side, the case has been delayed until now for more than half a year. Recently, there is hope for continued negotiations. The history of the case and recent news are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, acting on the instructions of the Municipal Government and the Executive Yuan, and Mr. Fessenden, Director-General of the Public Works Department, acting on the instructions of the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department, held consultations back and forth, and their opinions were quite close. A draft agreement was also drafted, detailing the administrative issues of recovering the extraterritorial roads. Both parties separately requested instructions from their competent authorities. The Executive Yuan requested the original text of the draft agreement reported by the Municipal Government and instructed that the wording be revised. After receiving the order, Secretary Yu consulted with Mr. Fessenden again. The Public Works Department also intended to accommodate our amendments to the wording. Unexpectedly, at this time, the Japanese side obstructed the process with various demands, causing it to be delayed indefinitely.</p>
<p>Japanese Obstruction</p>
<p>The Japanese opposition to our country's recovery of the extraterritorial roads was initially expressed by Japanese directors Terai and Okamoto at the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department. However, because the majority of the directors from various countries supported the return to our country, the Japanese directors' opposition failed as an absolute minority in the Board of Directors. They then changed their tactics and had the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, Ishii Jūtaro, negotiate with the Public Works Department. Mr. Fessenden and Mr. Ishii consulted back and forth for half a year, during which time our negotiations with the Public Works Department could not proceed. We then quietly waited for the development between the Public Works Department and the Japanese Consulate. Examining the Japanese methods of obstruction, the area of the extraterritorial roads in the Public Concession is mostly in the Northwest Two Districts, and the lives and property of the Japanese living in Shanghai are mostly based in the extraterritorial road section of the Northwest One District. They believe that after the area is returned to the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government, the protection of the Japanese will not be trusted. Therefore, they have tried their best to oppose the recovery. Later, because the Public Works Department was very eager to return the area to our side, the negotiations were quite promising, and the draft agreement was about to be finalized. Therefore, the Japanese Consul expressed to the Public Works Department that the Japanese side wanted to retain police power. However, this move concerns our national sovereignty, and the Public Works Department knew that it could not be accommodated by our side. Therefore, the two sides consulted on this point. The Japanese initially insisted on this proposal, and later demanded the establishment of a Japanese deputy police chief and the recruitment of Japanese special police officers. Discussions lasted for half a year. Because the Public Works Department and the Japanese Consulate kept strict secrets, there were few rumors outside. Even if there were rumors, they were not very detailed. Therefore, news about the recovery of the extraterritorial roads has been silent in the newspapers for more than half a year.</p>
<p>Recent Developments</p>
<p>It is heard that there have been new developments in the recent negotiations between the Public Works Department and the Japanese Consulate. Therefore, the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department once again brought up the old matter for discussion at the regular meeting last week. At the same time, there is news that the Public Works Department will continue with our side. Therefore, it has been confirmed that the Japanese Consulate has made concessions. However, the specific nature of this concession is still unclear because the two sides are still keeping secrets. Only the Public Works Department's statement that it will continue negotiations with our side has not been denied by any party.</p>
<h3>Insufficient Japanese Cargo Ships Between Shanghai and Japan</h3>
<p>Chinese Cargo Rejected</p>
<p>Japanese Self-Satisfaction</p>
<p>According to yesterday's Japanese-language Shanghai Daily News, the cargo ships of the Japanese Deng Chuan Shipping Company that travel between Japan and Shanghai, in addition to the designated route ships Dajia and Zhujun between Tokyo, there are also the Seiko and Mikasa between Osaka and Kobe. In the past, there were also the Kasagi and Yahata between Osaka and Kobe to receive and transport goods. Since the outbreak of the Manchurian Incident, the shipping industry has suddenly declined, and the transportation of goods has also suddenly decreased. Therefore, the number of cargo ships was also reduced by two. Today, the export of goods to Japan is very strong, and ships are insufficient. Commodities such as broad beans, rapeseed, cottonseed, pomace, bran, and beef bones are in large quantities. The outbound cargo of companies such as Mitsui, Yongfa, Yoshida, and Masuyuki in this port averages around 25,000 tons, but the capacity of the above two ships is only 3,600 tons, and they only travel back and forth twice a month. Therefore, transportation is quite difficult, and all parties hope to restore the previous ships to meet the demand. At the same time, the import of miscellaneous goods from Japan to this port is 1,500 to 2,000 tons per ship, and transportation is still insufficient.</p>
<h3>Export Subsidy for Stored Silk Stopped Yesterday</h3>
<p>More than 19,000 Bales Sold</p>
<p>The Reorganization and Promotion Associations End at the Same Time</p>
<p>The governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, in order to relieve the silk industry, issued a short-term public bond of 3 million yuan in the 21st year of the Republic (1932), and established the Stored Factory Silk Promotion and Stored Factory/Stored Cocoon Reorganization Committees to handle promotion and registration matters. For each bale of stored silk exported, the government subsidized 140 yuan of public bonds. The two committees were ordered to stop issuing subsidies at the end of May and stipulated a method for exceeding 20,000 bales. Yesterday was the deadline, and it is estimated that more than 19,000 bales have received government subsidies. This has been reported to the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and the governments of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces. As for the two committees being ordered to end, it has been decided that they will handle various unfinished procedures starting today.</p>
<h3>Municipal Party Headquarters Cables Tang Shaochuan and Others to Unite Against the Enemy and Save the Crisis</h3>
<p>Also Cables Hu Hanmin in Hong Kong</p>
<p>Please Release Private Grievances and Work Together to Overcome Difficulties</p>
<p>The Municipal Party Headquarters, because the Southwest Tang Shaochuan and others fabricated conditions and issued telegrams indiscriminately, destroying the national position, sent a cable of encouragement yesterday. At the same time, a cable was sent to Mr. Hu Hanmin to overcome difficulties together. The telegrams are excerpted as follows: (1) Respectfully to Committee Member Tang Shaochuan of Xizhou, Committee Member Su Focheng, and all Central Committee members: Recently, we saw Reuters reports that comrades fabricated conditions in telegrams to the League of Nations, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, and the representatives of various countries in China, slandering the Central Government, which is deeply shocking. Now, when a strong enemy is pressing down and the country is in a critical state, all Chinese people should unite from top to bottom to resist the enemy and save this critical situation. However, the comrades, as Central Committee members, are far away in southern Guangdong, talking empty words about resisting Japan, but not immediately sending troops north. They are talking loudly about suppressing the Communists, but not sending troops to encircle them. They are only using provocative means to spread rumors, discouraging the courage of the Communist suppression army, alienating the feelings of the anti-Japanese generals, holding a bystander's mentality, and scheming for schadenfreude. They do not know that the enemy is using this point to slander us as an unorganized country. The comrades are even more unaware and are indiscriminately sending telegrams to the international community, destroying the national position, giving people opportunities, and affecting diplomacy, which is most serious. We especially send a telegram of advice, hoping that they will repent and take warning from the danger of a destroyed nest and broken eggs, embrace the ambition of sharing the same boat, unite to resist the enemy, and save the crisis together. Time waits for no one, and we hope they will act quickly. Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee Seal. (2) Respectfully to Mr. Hu Zhantang in Hong Kong: Previously, because the national crisis was becoming increasingly urgent and unity was imperative, we and the party headquarters of 21 provinces and cities, including Jiangsu and Nanjing, sent a telegram requesting you to return to the capital as soon as possible to relieve the national crisis together. We meant that with your past love for the party and loyalty to the country, it would not be difficult to resolve private grievances and live up to the expectations of the people. We did not expect that after more than ten days, you would still be lingering on the Miaogao Terrace. At this time, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee fabricated the conditions for a compromise between China and Japan, created slanderous rumors against the Central Government, and spread them not only domestically but also to the League of Nations, the signatory countries of the Nine-Power Treaty, and the representatives of various countries, exposing the weaknesses of disunity and giving the enemy excuses to insult our country. Although this is not your direct responsibility, with your ambiguous attitude and passive actions, those who do not know will certainly think that it is under your direction. Is this not something that will be greatly grieved by loved ones and gladdened by enemies? Alas, national hatred is still tolerable, but private hatred is the most difficult to eliminate. The house of Ming Society is actually born from this. Could it be that a wise man cannot avoid it? Then it is believable that the country cannot be saved. We weep as we send this telegram, awaiting your clear instructions. Shanghai Special Municipal Executive Committee of the Kuomintang.</p>
<h3>The Red Swastika Society Shelters More Than 50,000 Refugees in Beijing and Tianjin</h3>
<p>Maintaining Relief Requires Huge Funds</p>
<p>Hoping That All Sectors Will Quickly Raise Funds for Assistance</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Office of the World Red Swastika Society is extremely concerned about the relief situation in North China, as the situation there is changing daily and many refugees are flocking to the Beijing-Tianjin area. The office previously sent a telegram to the Beijing and Tianjin Red Swastika Societies asking about the relief situation. Yesterday, it received a reply from Beijing and Tianjin, stating that the Swastika Society has currently established more than 30 refugee shelters in the Beijing, Tianjin, and Letang areas, sheltering more than 50,000 refugees. The ongoing maintenance and relief work in the shelters requires huge funds, and the economy is gradually becoming exhausted. They requested a quick fundraising effort for assistance and consultation with all sectors on relief methods. The telegrams are excerpted below:</p>
<p>Beijing Telegram: To the Shanghai Red Swastika Society General Office, Danshui Road, British Concession: Your telegram has been received. Since the military situation has changed, refugees are still flocking to Beijing. The shelters previously established by this society have been overcrowded, so we have expanded to 25 shelters, housing more than 20,000 refugees. From the 20th to the 28th, this society dispatched more than 30 cars, day and night, to transport refugees to Beijing for separate shelter. It is estimated that 3,230 people were temporarily sheltered in Lan Dianchang and Qinglongqiao, 2,562 people were sheltered in Longquansi, 1,860 people were sheltered in Lejia Garden and Zhangjia Garden, 429 new people were sheltered in the New World in addition to the 263 people previously sheltered, 156 people were sheltered in Qinglongqiao, 75 people were sheltered in the Haidian Wanping branch, 349 people were sheltered in Guanghuasi, and 280 people were sheltered in Jijiayao. All refugees rescued from Changping and Gaobeidian to Beijing are temporarily resting in the shelters and then going to relatives or dispersing to various dance halls in the southwest of Beijing, totaling 7,325 people. The refugees are supporting the old and carrying the young, which is very pitiful. We are still continuing relief efforts, which are in full swing. The expenses are huge and are gradually exhausting. The current maintenance costs of each shelter are already difficult to sustain for long. When the refugees return to their hometowns in the future, they will have nothing, and we must make great efforts to plan for relief so that they can survive to the end. Please raise funds for relief from the various societies in the southeast and consult with all sectors on relief methods for refugees and wounded soldiers. We are eagerly awaiting your help. General Society, World.</p>
<p>Tianjin Telegram: To the Shanghai Red Swastika Society General Office: Your telegram has been received. In recent days, we have sent relief teams to Funing, Wuqing, Yangcun, Meichang, and Maidi to rescue refugees from various places to Tianjin, totaling 6,795 people, who have been sent to the East Bureau and Tangjiakou for shelter. In addition, the tenth team has set up four shelters in the east and west of Tangshan, sheltering more than 3,700 refugee women and children. In recent days, more and more refugees have been coming to Tianjin. It has been decided to contact various charitable organizations to jointly expand the shelter and to contact the Department of Civil Affairs to find suitable housing for shelter. In addition, the commissioner of the fourth relief team stationed in Le County reported to Tianjin that after the withdrawal of the garrison, the residents of the four villages had fled into the city. The team had set up four shelters one after another, sheltering more than 4,000 people. This is a telegram reply. Please note. Tianjin Red Swastika Society.</p>

<h3>Two Associations Raise Aviation Donations</h3>
<p>Shipping Association: For the matter of raising the Aviation Patriotic Fund, the association's executive committee passed a fundraising method yesterday. The resolution is recorded as follows: "Each shipping company will donate 2 yuan in national currency per month for every 100 tons of its ships. The seamen of each ship and the staff of each company will donate 1% of their monthly salary, starting from June 1st of this year to May 31st of the 23rd year of the Republic (1934)." The association has notified all members to act accordingly.</p>
<p>Restaurants and Wine Shops: Notice No. 16 on Fundraising 100,000 Yuan for the Aviation Patriotic Fund: We are writing to you regarding the case of the China Aviation Association raising funds to save the country. On May 15th, we received a letter from Mayor Wu stating, "The construction of the Air Force is the center of modern national defense planning, and our country's military backwardness is in particularly urgent need of it. The leaders of all sectors in this city, in view of this, have initiated the organization of the China Aviation Association, with the aim of gathering popular support to assist the government in expanding the construction of the Air Force and air defense, and have begun to solicit members and raise funds in this city. I am incompetent, but have been nominated by all sectors as the commander of the fundraising team. For two months, I have worked hard to raise funds, and the results have only reached half of the original amount. I am deeply grateful for the trust. I have always admired the enthusiasm and patriotism of all of you in your association. When you are moved by an event, you will collect a large sum of money. I am writing to your association to request that you raise 100,000 yuan for the Aviation Patriotic Fund, so that we can gather a large sum of money to purchase warplanes. I have sent Mr. Hong En, Director of the Municipal Government's Cultural Bureau, to contact you in person. The matter concerns saving the country, and I hope that you will sincerely negotiate on my behalf." Based on this, the chief of the second section of the Public Security Bureau, Mr. Hong, came to the meeting on the 19th of this month to consult on the fundraising method. If necessary, the Public Security Bureau will help in the progress. We urge members and non-members to abide by the regulations and donate as much as possible to save the country. We also hope that you will actively participate in the Aviation Association and assume the amount of donations. The matter concerns saving the country and brooks no delay. If you have any insights or recognized donation amounts, as well as well-planned fundraising methods, please send them to the meeting for progress and reach the goal. Otherwise, we will only be able to jointly distribute the funds among non-members and members. Please do not delay. We are recording this case and sending it to you for your reference and reply. To members and non-members,</p>
<h3>Unemployment Issue of Workers at Japanese-Owned Taishan Factory Resolved</h3>
<p>Female Workers Transferred to Da Zhongyang Factory, Male Workers Dismissed</p>
<p>National News Agency reports that the Taishan Rubber Factory in Hongkou, owned by Japanese merchants, specializes in manufacturing Taishan rubber overshoes for sale in our country. After the September 18th Incident, Chinese people unanimously rejected Japanese goods, and the factory's business plummeted. It was then taken over by Huashangren Zhongyang Rubber Factory, which dispatched workers to continue working. The original 70-odd male and female workers of the factory were all unemployed and repeatedly requested the party and government authorities to provide relief. It is now learned that the case has been mediated by the Fourth District Rubber Industry Trade Union, which has reached an agreement with the Da Zhongyang Factory to allow all female workers to transfer to the factory for work, but all male workers will be given severance pay and dismissed. The workers have also expressed their agreement, and the dispute has been resolved.</p>
<h3>Reply from Tung Wah Hospital to Kwong Siu Public Hall</h3>
<p>To Fund the Return of Displaced Overseas Chinese Expelled from Mexico</p>
<p>Reply from Pan Xiaochu to Kwong Siu Public Hall: Revered Chairman Qin Fu of the Shanghai Kwong Siu Public Hall: I have received your letter stating that Chinese living in Mexico have been expelled and are returning to their home countries. Recently, more than 50 people have passed through Shanghai, and you have given them 1,000 yuan in aid. In addition, when they arrive in Hong Kong, if the investigation is clear and they lack travel expenses, you will be able to find a way to fund their return to their home countries. If donations are needed, this hospital is also happy to donate a portion, etc. This shows your public hall's concern for the expelled overseas Chinese and your enthusiastic relief, which is deeply admired. It has been found that the overseas Chinese expelled from Mexico who passed through this port the other day have been properly taken care of by our hospital. It is estimated that more than 80 people have been funded to return to their hometowns. This is all because we cannot remain indifferent and our duty does not allow us to refuse. If there are any more who pass through Hong Kong or need to raise donations for relief, then we will send a letter to request your assistance. Special reply, and wish you well. From Pan Xiaochu and others, Directors of Tung Wah Hospital, Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>Two Exchanges to Merge Today</h3>
<p>Increase Capital Stock and Brokers</p>
<p>Inaugural Meeting to be Held in July</p>

<h3>Maritime Administration Bureau Stipulates Restrictions on Foreign Crew Members on Chinese Ships</h3>
<p>Otherwise, Customs Will Not Allow Departure</p>
<p>National News Agency reports that the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications recently issued an order stipulating that Chinese crew members should be used as a principle for all Chinese ships. If it is necessary to hire foreign crew members, a certificate issued by the Ministry must be obtained, otherwise Customs may not allow the ship to depart. The Bureau has now ordered all shipping companies in the city to implement this regulation. As a result, companies such as Datong Renji Shipping Company and Haichang Shipping Company, where most of the shipmasters and first and second officers are Japanese, are deeply concerned that Customs will not allow them to travel on Shanghai, so they have dismissed all Japanese crew members and replaced them with Chinese crew members.</p>
<h3>Businessmen and Residents of the North Sichuan Road War Zone Petitioned Party and Government Agencies Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Present to the Central Government for Request</p>
<p>North Sichuan Road and North Laobazi Road are located in the extraterritorial road areas. For decades, there has been no imposition of house tax. In the past, the Public Works Department compiled house numbers. In the 16th year of the Republic (1927), citizens demolished the blocked roads and blocked the main roads, automatically prying off the house numbers and re-nailing the Chinese house numbers. It is unknown that yesterday, Director Liang of the Tax Collection Office of the Zhabei Finance Bureau, disregarding the hardships of the merchants and residents, rashly sent two tax collectors, leading six policemen, to each shop to forcibly collect house tax, with great fanfare, threatening to arrest the employees. Therefore, at 3 pm, representatives of each shop gathered for a meeting and decided that more than 300 shops would jointly prepare a report and push Guan Qichuan, Jin Yongxiang, Wei Langxuan, Ye Qichang, and Hu Zhaoying to take the joint report to the Municipal Government to petition, requesting that the rights be recovered first and the house tax be collected later. Xu Shaoxiu was received, stated the intentions, and expressed his sympathy, promising to forward the above to the mayor to order the collection to stop. The representatives then said goodbye and went to the Municipal Party Headquarters, where Zhang Zhixiao, the representative, promised to forward it to the higher authorities for review. The representatives considered it satisfactory and withdrew. It is also heard that each shop has prepared another petition to the Central Party Headquarters and the Executive Yuan, requesting a ban.</p>
<h3>Zhabei Fire Fighting Joint Association Ambulance Begins Service</h3>
<p>Since the Zhabei District Fire Fighting Joint Association suffered losses in the Shanghai War, in order to seek a return to the original, in addition to moving the association to Baoshan Road and Qiujiang Road for convenience, it has recently been learned that the Zhabei citizens are in danger of life when they encounter fire or fall and break. In order to strive for relief, each member of the association, under the leadership of Standing Committee Member Wang Binyan, etc., has purchased an ambulance in accordance with the methods of the South City Concession to specialize in internal escort and rescue of the wounded. Preparations have been made for a long time and are now ready. It is scheduled to start service on June 1st and has been reported to the Municipal Government for record. If Zhabei citizens have the above situation, they can report by phone number 42476 (Chinese Automatic Machine) so that they can rush to the scene as soon as possible and do not charge any fees.</p>
<h3>Record of the Annual Meeting of the British-owned Four Seas Insurance Company</h3>
<p>The British-owned Four Seas Insurance Company at No. 17 on the Bund held its third annual shareholders' meeting the day before yesterday. All shareholders and directors attended, and Mr. Smith was publicly elected as chairman. In addition to reporting the purpose of the meeting and reading the business situation and various accounts of the previous year, the chairman made the following brief report: "Last year (1932), under the global economic downturn, various businesses showed no signs of recovery, and the Far East was no exception. Consequently, the insurance business also suffered a major blow. Fortunately, with the guidance of the board of directors and the efforts of the staff in various departments, the company was able to achieve special progress under this severe situation, which is gratifying for all shareholders. The company's various business revenues increased sharply last year (detailed figures can be found in the business report), especially in life insurance. During this year, the effective insured amount increased from 202,480 taels to 2,513,280 taels. The total profit of various businesses was 104,819 taels, which is sufficient to demonstrate the company's business progress. The deposit of various reserves has also increased by more than double compared to the past, totaling 259,990.64 taels, which is even more sufficient to prove that the company's foundation is becoming increasingly solid. During this year, in addition to the Shanghai head office, branches were established in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Peiping, Tianjin, and other places to operate various insurance businesses in these areas. In order to enhance the awareness of the Chinese people regarding the benefits of life insurance and to promote business development, the company, together with the responsible persons of various life insurance companies, established the Chinese Life Insurance Advancement Association, providing it with financial support to fulfill its mission of promoting the theories and benefits of life insurance and developing the Chinese life insurance industry, and writing various texts and books on life insurance science to educate the Chinese people about the understanding and investment of life insurance. In addition, the company's colleagues, considering the need for life insurance in China, in addition to the various policies already issued, plan to issue group insurance, industrial insurance, and other policies at low prices to meet the needs of the Chinese people. This is the general situation of the company in the past year. Although the company was established not long ago, its business situation has improved year by year, and future prospects are promising. It is not difficult to become the only financial institution in the Far East." After the chairman's report, the company continued to discuss various ongoing plans and passed the following resolutions: (1) The current surplus of 104,819 taels, together with the balance of 51,542.48 taels carried over from the previous year, after deducting the ordinary reserve of 140,187.51 taels to meet the requirement of 250,000 taels, the remaining balance of 16,171.97 taels will be carried over to the next year's calculation. (2) Approve the accounts of the board of directors and auditors for the current term. (3) Ratify the appointment of Mr. Madden and Mr. Xu Xinliu as directors of the company. (4) Elect V. Meger, M. Speelman, and A. J. Welchill as directors of the company. (5) Appoint Lowe, Bingham, and Matthewsill as auditors of the company. After the various resolutions were passed, a gathering was held and then adjourned.</p>

<h3>Debate on Li Guojie Case Concluded</h3>
<p>Public and Private Lawsuits Both Concluded, Sentencing on June 5th</p>
<p>Lawyers on Both Sides Eloquently Debated for Two Hours</p>
<p>Westerner Sutterly Called as Witness</p>
<p>Li Guojie, the former general manager of the China Merchants Bureau, was originally sentenced to three years in prison by the Shanghai District Court for allegedly breaching trust, harming the interests of the bureau, committing fraud in borrowing foreign debts, and bribing Supervisor Chen Fumu with 700,000 taels. Li refused to accept the sentence and appealed. The Criminal Division 1 of the Jiangsu High Court, with Presiding Judge Lin Zhechang, Judges Fang Wen and Si Wen, Prosecutor Hong Guifen, Clerks Qian Zemin and Li Wang, and others, came to Shanghai to hear the case in the District Court. Yesterday afternoon at 1 p.m., the trial continued in the first courtroom. The head of the China Business Company was summoned.</p>
<p>Sutterly testified that he was 73 years old and an American. He knew Li Guojie. (Question) Did Li Guojie, as manager of the China Merchants Bureau, sign a contract with the China Business Company? (Answer) Yes. (Question) Was it for borrowing money for docks, building storage, and buying ships? (Answer) Yes. (Question) How much money was borrowed? (Answer) 3,000 taels. (Question) What was the interest rate? (Answer) 9% per week. (Question) Was there a commission? (Answer) Usually 2.5%. This loan was for issuing bonds, and the actual receipt was 85%, which is different from ordinary loans. It's like the city's bonds being sold at 80% of their face value. However, it would take ten years to repay the full face value. However, this loan plan was very large, and as soon as a floor was built, the China Merchants Bureau could develop on this land. As for the harsh conditions, this is the usual practice in Shanghai, the same for everyone, so that they know the restrictions. Moreover, the China Merchants Bureau couldn't even pay for the two Norwegian ships it bought, and tried to evade payment, so we had to set up retention rights, etc., to wait for payment. (Question) Did it also infringe on ownership? (Answer) Bonds, that is, issuing bonds for ships, must have the ships as collateral, so there is ownership. (Question) When were the bonds issued? (Answer) Early September. (Question) Was there an advance payment? (Answer) 700,000 taels. (Question) What was it for? (Answer) Checks. (Question) Who told you about it? (Answer) Li Guojie said that according to us, it was to fulfill the debt payment, but they wanted to borrow 700,000 first, and said it again and again, so they paid 700,000. (Question) Did you know it was paid to Chen Fumu? (Answer) I paid the money to the China Merchants Bureau, and handed over the bank certificates to us, so that we could redeem them in the future. We took the receipt from the China Merchants Bureau. (Question) Did Li Guojie say that there would be a contract after the payment? (Answer) No. If there were such words, we wouldn't allow him to come. (Question) Who delivered the 700,000 taels? (Answer) Comprador Dou Yaoting. (Question) What did you say when you handed it to Dou? (Answer) I told him to send it to the China Merchants Bureau. (Question) Did Dou say anything? (Answer) He didn't say anything, just handed me a package. (Question) How did you deliver the 710,000 taels? (Answer) With checks. (Question) Was there any cash? (Answer) No. (Question) Was there a commission in the 1.5 million taels? (Answer) Absolutely none. (Question) Was the 2.5% commission shared? 0 (Answer) No, we believed that Mr. Li was cautious and never defaulted on a penny. Later, Nanjing telegraphed me, and I went to Nanjing to see Minister Song, only to learn about this matter, and immediately explained the situation, how I didn't like it, and that it could be resolved. Now we are sincerely negotiating, etc. At this point, the official (questioned)</p>
<p>Li Guojie: What about Sutterly's testimony? (Answer) Just that he is older and confused 20 million with 30 million. The prosecutor Zhan Guifen then gave his opinion, believing that Li was guilty, but that the legal provisions had to be changed, etc. Then, the defense lawyers Zhang Yipeng, Sha Xunyi, Jiang Yiping, etc. gave their arguments on the legal facts, which lasted for about two hours. The questioning official then declared the conclusion of the public prosecution debate, and the sentencing was set for 11 a.m. on June 5. Then, he began to interrogate the attached civil lawsuit. Liu Hongsheng, the legal representative of the China Merchants Bureau, appointed lawyer Wang Youling as his agent, stating that regardless of whether there was a criminal offense, the 700,000 taels was taken by Li Guojie, and there was no proof of whether it was handed over. According to the provisions of the Civil Code, he requested a judgment ordering the return of the money, and requested a provisional execution to seize private property, etc. The official questioned Li, who refused to compensate, and said that the money was taken by Chen Fumu and had nothing to do with him. His defense lawyers also stated that the government sent a supervisor to restrict Li's exercise of his duties, and the supervisor was the manager, while the manager was like an employee and could not be held responsible. They also compared various matters, such as the case in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, where the head of the trial court, Mei Yigu, absconded with the money, and the receiving and dispatching clerks and accountants who did not transfer the money were sentenced to pay compensation, and refuted that the China Merchants Bureau was not an ordinary store, etc. At this point, the lawyers on both sides had a great debate. The official again declared the conclusion of the private lawsuit debate, and also set the sentencing for June 5 at the same time, and then adjourned the court.</p>
<h3>Continuous All-Out Brawl on the Samsung Stage</h3>
<p>Zhao Ruquan First Performed Twenty Episodes of the Peng Gong Case</p>
<p>General Audience Continued to Fight Each Other</p>
<p>[A Disturbance After Zhao Ruquan Was Detained]</p>
<p>Zhao Ruquan, a famous actor on the Samsung stage, was in charge of the backstage manager of the stage. Zhou Bingchen was the front-stage manager, and each was originally responsible for their own duties. However, Zhao and Zhou had deep differences and could not cooperate, and were mutually exclusive. Recently, Zhou reported to the Laozha Police Station that Zhao had embezzled more than 30,000 gold coins of public funds. However, after investigation, only 1,240 yuan of embezzlement was found. The police station transferred the case to the First Special District District Court to issue an arrest warrant. On the night of the 29th, detectives Chen Yonggui and Yang Guanying rushed to the Samsung Stage Theater on Niuzhuang Road to arrest him. Zhao was playing Ouyang De in the twenty episodes of the Peng Gong Case drama, showing his skills on stage. When Chen and Yang arrested him, the audience suddenly saw Ouyang De being taken away by the officials, and there was a great uproar. Although the play ended, the audience did not leave. Because they had spent money but had not seen the whole picture, they demanded refunds. The director of the stage said that the play had ended and the customers had not suffered any losses, and refused to refund the tickets. This aroused public anger, and an all-out brawl broke out again. Teapots and teacups flew around, and chairs and stools were destroyed and thrown. For a time, the order was chaotic. The Laozha Police Station was notified and immediately ordered a large team of armed detectives to suppress the disturbance, and arrested Lu Huiquan and Hu Shoufu on the spot. The rest scattered and fled. The next morning, the police station sent Zhao Ruquan, Lu, and Hu to the First Special District Court. Presiding Judge Feng Shide interrogated them. Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the police station explained the case. Then, Zhou Bingchen, the plaintiff, appointed lawyers Chen Tingrui and Yuan Yang'an to appear in court to defend him. Zhao Ruquan, the defendant, also appointed lawyer Jiang Yiping to briefly defend him. After the presiding judge Feng ruled that the defendant Zhao Ruquan should be remanded in custody and rescheduled for a hearing on Saturday. As for the two defendants Lu and Hu, who were accused of destroying the stage, Judge Wang Ren heard the case. Lawyer Jiang Baolian of the police station stated that the stage suffered a loss of about 1,000 yuan. When questioned, the defendants shirked their responsibilities. Judge Wang ruled that each should be fined 50 yuan as a warning.</p>
<h3>Co-Tenant Suddenly Turns Thief</h3>
<p>Gangs Up with Bandits Under the Guise of Mahjong</p>
<p>Howls Upstairs in the Middle of the Night to Commit Robbery</p>
<p>No. 22 Jubao Lane, Chengdu Road, is a one-story building with four households. The sub-landlord is Huang Weimin, who lives in the front building and rents out the pavilion to He Changbao from Zhenjiang. He used to be a battalion commander under Xing Shilian, but resigned to recuperate in Shanghai due to a foot injury. The back of the lobby downstairs is rented to Mo Baosheng, and the back building is rented to a Chen family. All was peaceful. Unexpectedly, Mo Baosheng was actually a member of a gang. Although his usual behavior was illegal, the co-tenants were unaware of the details. On the night of May 25, he gathered six accomplices and went to his home to play. After 10 p.m., they became interested in gambling. Mo invited He Changbao and two of his accomplices to play mahjong, while the other four watched. By the time the twelve rounds ended, it was already 3 a.m. All the co-tenants had fallen asleep. Seeing that the time had come, Mo let out a yell to notify his accomplices. They each took out pistols, warning everyone not to make a sound. They first tied He with ropes and kept him under surveillance in the back room. Then they went upstairs and entered He's bedroom. He's wife, Chen, and daughter, Chunxiang (16 years old), were awakened from their sleep. They were ordered not to make a sound, forced to hand over the key, and robbed of a gold bracelet, a gold chain, a gold sheet, as well as 80 yuan in cash, clothes, and other items, estimated to be worth 751 yuan. They took the stolen goods and escaped with Mo's wife. Later, He's wife managed to untie her husband's ropes and reported to the Xinzha Police Station. Detectives Tao Rubing and Sun Jishan were dispatched to investigate and brought back a mahjong set and a rope to the police station. Because a similar case had occurred on Ma Huo Road a few days ago, a strict investigation was started. He Changbao's daughter, He Chunxiang, was taken to various public places, tea houses, and hotels to investigate. It wasn't until 9:40 a.m. the day before yesterday that Zhou Shaoqing, a thief from Changzhou, was found in the Liyuan Tea House in the City God Temple in the city. He's daughter identified Zhou as the thief who had held a gun and robbed them at the time. He was arrested by the Zhengan Bureau police and taken back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Division 8 of the First Special District Court. Lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station detailed the circumstances of the case and requested a postponement to apprehend the accomplices. He Changbao, along with his wife Chen and daughter Chunxiang, testified that they were robbed by Mo Baosheng, a co-tenant, under the pretext of playing mahjong. The defendant who was arrested was indeed a thief holding a gun. Defendant Zhou Shaoqing confessed that he had visited Mo's house once in February, which allowed him to meet He, but that he neither gambled nor robbed that night. Please investigate. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and ordered Zhou to be remanded in custody for seven days for further investigation.</p>

<p>According to a reporter from Xinsheng News Agency, the Lian'an Company announced yesterday that two water police officers were killed and four passengers and teahouse staff were injured, and one passenger was kidnapped in the robbery of the Taizhou ship. The Haiment Taizhou Steamship Head Office immediately telegraphed to strictly apprehend the pirates and rescue the kidnapped passengers. The Second Brigade of the Water Police stationed at Jinqing Port in Huangyan and the Wenling Water Police Bureau immediately dispatched armed water police to jointly pursue the pirates. On the evening of the 26th, a fierce battle broke out with the pirates in the pirate den east of Jinqing Port. A small headman of the pirates, Lin Erdi, was captured alive and sent to the headquarters for strict punishment. Several pirates were killed and three guns were seized. Two water police officers, Huang Zhengqi and Li Chang'an, were killed.</p>
<p>Sailing to Shanghai Tomorrow</p>
<p>As for whether the kidnapped passenger Jin Ziqing has been rescued, the Haiment Head Office report did not mention it. Details will be available when the Dahua ship arrives in Shanghai on June 1. However, the Taizhou ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 2nd. The notice is recorded as follows: The Taizhou ship is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on June 2 and sail to Dingpu, Shipu, and Haiment on the 3rd. It will continue to operate as usual afterwards. For fear that it has not been fully informed, this notice is given.</p>
<p>Telegraphic Request for Strict Apprehension</p>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association sent a fast mail telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government in Hangzhou, the Zhejiang Provincial Security Department, the Zhenhai Zhejiang Offshore Water Police Bureau, and the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, stating that the member Taizhou Xinji Shipping Company stated in a letter that the company's Taizhou ship sailed from Haiment to Shanghai on the 24th of this month and arrived at the waters of Nanbei and Bamen. Suddenly, pirates disguised as passengers opened fire and robbed the ship. Two water police officers and a girl on board were killed, and a tea attendant and two water police officers were injured. One passenger was kidnapped. The robbery lasted about 23 hours, and dozens of searches were carried out. The silver dollars and ship documents stored in the ship's accounting room, as well as the silver dollars, clothing, luggage, etc. carried by the crew and passengers, were all looted. Finally, they were forced to sail to Langqishan to land and escape. In addition to the company in Haiment dividing the Zhejiang Offshore Water Police Bureau, the Zhejiang Provincial Government, and the military and police agencies stationed in Haiment to strictly apprehend and encircle the bandits, it is appropriate to write to the association to forward the letter to the Shanghai Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications for the record, and to send it to the military and police agencies in Zhejiang to strictly investigate and deal with it, so as to pacify the bandits and ensure the safety of travelers.

<h3>Zhao Weixian, Suspect in the Wei Tingrong Kidnapping Case, Released to the Garrison Headquarters</h3>
<p>Zhao Weixian, the sixth battalion commander of the Tax Police Special Service Regiment of the Ministry of Finance, a native of Zhengzhou, Henan, was previously involved in the kidnapping case of Wei Tingrong, the former commander of the Chinese Volunteer Corps in the French Concession, in July of the eighteenth year. He was arrested and sent to the Second Special Court by the French police in the autumn of the year before last. Because Zhao was an active-duty officer, he was ordered to be sent to a military court for trial. Because of the issue of jurisdiction, after three trials, it was ruled that he should still be sent to a military agency for review. The details have been recorded in the previous official records. The Judge Guo Dezhang of the Third High Court executed the transfer at noon the day before yesterday. Zhao was brought to the court and briefly questioned. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen stood up and stated the police's opinion. According to Zhao's defense lawyers, Shan Yuhua and Ge Zhaoji, they stood up and claimed that Zhao was only suspected in the case and had no major responsibility. They requested that Zhao be allowed to provide a reliable shop guarantee and go to the headquarters to await interrogation after the court transferred him. The official said that the court today executed the final judgment of the third trial, and ruled that there was no time limit for the handling. It was allowed to be released on bail, and Zhao said that the military prosecutor's office here belongs to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters. You can go to the headquarters to request it. After finishing speaking, he handed over a public document and a package of files, along with Zhao Weixian, to the bailiff in court for transfer, and then adjourned the court. In the afternoon of the same day, he was sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for review.</p>
<h3>Socialite's Car Lawsuit</h3>

The defendant Xue Jinyuan appointed lawyer Jiang Yiping to appear in court to respond to the lawsuit. After Judge Mo questioned them, he ordered a postponement for further review. It is reported that Ms. Xue has now decided to return the car to the Madi Company, which will resell it and use the proceeds to offset the previous debts.</p>
<h3>A Local Thug Claiming to Be a Communist Stabs a Police Officer</h3>
<p>Shan Wen, a police officer from the Third District of Pudong, was stationed at the intersection of the new Lan Ni Du street around 10:30 PM on the 29th. At that moment, a middle-aged man reported to him that communist bandits were secretly meeting in the back street and requested an arrest. The officer, considering the matter of sedition, followed him to investigate. Unexpectedly, upon reaching a dark area near the Li family residence on the north side, the youth pulled out a sharp blade, proclaiming himself a member of the Communist Party. He then stabbed the officer violently in the back, penetrating deeply, and fled the scene. The wounded officer collapsed unconscious. A passerby discovered him and urgently reported it to the neighboring station. The injured officer was carried to Pudong Hospital for treatment, leaving a trail of blood. After being rescued and awakened by the doctor, the wound was cleaned and bandaged. District Chief Zhang Wuqin, upon receiving the report, immediately instructed the police to apprehend the culprit. He also telegraphed each precinct and team to cooperate in the capture. By midnight, Police Chief Guo Yongliang had arrested a suspect, the culprit's aunt, Ms. Dai, at No. 20, Lane 162, the site of the incident, and brought her to the district for questioning. She claimed her nephew, Ling Houlang, suffered from mental illness. Moments later, the suspect's uncle, Lu Chuanlin, also arrived at the district to report, volunteering to assist in the arrest of his nephew. By 7:00 AM the next morning (the 30th), Chuanlin arrived at the Dada Wharf in Nanshi, where he spotted the suspect preparing to flee back to his native Chongming. He immediately reported it to the wharf police, who apprehended him and brought him to the First District. Subsequently, Police Chief Guo from the Third District transferred him back for interrogation by District Chief Zhang. The suspect confessed that he was 31 years old and from Chongming, working as a mate on an iron barge at No. 156, Huide Li. He claimed that the previous night he had a dream where his cousin (the son of his uncle) forcibly violated his wife. The next morning, he questioned his uncle, but was scolded for being unreasonable. Therefore, the previous night, he took a knife intending to kill his uncle to relieve his anger. Suddenly, he saw a police officer walking towards him with a gun, assuming it was his uncle who had reported him. As a preemptive measure, he wounded the officer. The District Chief found his confession quite absurd, as if he were truly mentally ill. He was to be charged with assaulting a public security police officer and sent to the General Bureau for interrogation. During the escort, the suspect murmured incoherently, declaring that he had joined the Communist Party and was very happy, while also displaying a bitter smile, which was quite pathetic. As for the injured officer, his injuries were severe, and he had been transferred to Shanghai Hospital in Nanshi for medical treatment.</p>
<h3>Jade Merchant Tian Jitang's Home Robbed</h3>
<p>A Detective Captures a Thief</p>
<p>Tian Jitang, a 66-year-old man from Suzhou, lived at No. 3, Xiecheng Lane, behind the Liyuan Guild Hall on Fangbang Road in Nanshi. He ran a jade business and was of modest means, which attracted the attention of robbers. Yesterday at 5:45 PM, five robbers suddenly arrived. One of them was armed with a pistol. Upon entering, they herded everyone in the house into one room, preparing to rob the place. However, the mistress of the house, Tian Pan (a 40-year-old woman from Nanjing), pounded loudly on the adjacent side door with her fist several times. Upon hearing the noise, the robbers knew things were not going well and quickly rushed to escape. The robber with the gun struck Pan on the head with the pistol butt, causing a head wound and profuse bleeding. As the five robbers fled, they ran eastward along Jiumu Di in a panic. After escaping past the Jiumu Di intersection, they were spotted by Yang Huiji, guard No. 19 at the police kiosk there, who recognized them as suspicious characters. He immediately joined forces with patrol officers Liu Wenhai, Qian Mengjiu, and Lei Jieqing to chase after them. They chased them all the way to the Mingguo Road intersection, where they were intercepted by the French Concession police. One robber was captured on the spot, and a six-inch Browning pistol with serial number 9748 and seven bullets were seized. He was taken to the Grand Clock Tower police station and then transferred to the Special Agency on Songshan Road. After a detailed interrogation by the detective chief, the suspect, named Mai Ying, confessed without hesitation to conspiring to rob. Subsequently, Shen, the chief of the First Branch of the Second District, ordered Inspectors Wang Zhongqing and Qi Bin to rush to the French police station to take custody of the robber and interrogate him strictly. The search for his accomplices is currently underway.</p>
<h3>Lost and Found: Stolen Stoves</h3>

<h3>Zhao Shaojing Overwhelmed with Emotions on the Dragon Boat Festival, Drowns Himself in the Huangpu River</h3>
<p>A Heartbreaking Suicide Note · A Pitiful Situation</p>
<p>| Luckily Rescued by a Boatman and Saved from Death |</p>
<p>Yesterday at 2:30 PM, a middle-aged man boarded the No. 9 ferry at the Chunjiang Wharf in Pudong and crossed to the center of the river. He suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. Captain Dai Lanfang managed to rescue him and sent him to the Customs Water Police Station. He identified himself as Zhao Shaojing, styled Pihua, 30 years old, from Jiangbei, residing at his mother-in-law's house in Zhujiaqiao, Jiangwan. He used to work at the Shunyu Money Shop on Tiantong Road in Hongkou, which has since closed down. He had been unemployed for three years and had experienced the hardship of economic pressure. He had also been looked down upon by relatives and friends. Therefore, before the Dragon Boat Festival, he left home and stayed at a small inn in the Caishi Street area. He had attempted suicide by swallowing opium, but it was ineffective. On the Dragon Boat Festival, seeing families gathering happily, he was overcome with emotions. He secretly wrote two suicide notes and waited until today to resolve to drown himself. Two letters were found on his person, one to his father and one to his wife. The detective chief instructed Bao Tan Yao Guofa to summon his family to the station and allow them to take him home. The letter to his wife is transcribed below: "To my beloved wife Qin: What day is today? A day when families gather to celebrate the Dragon Boat Festival, but also the day when we, husband and wife, are forever separated. The thought of suicide has been with me for many days. I tried swallowing raw opium the other day, but it didn't work. I suppose I'm not meant to die by fire, but by water. How sad! Every day I live, you suffer another day. People live to be a hundred, but must eventually die. I'm not afraid to die early, and it's better for you to start planning for your future. I hope you will send our child to be raised by my mother and remarry as soon as possible to find happiness. I'm always sorry to you. Your foolish husband, Zhao Yu."</p>

Please correct it in your newspaper as soon as possible. Sincerely, The Sixth District Office of Shanghai County, May 30th.</p>

<h3>Seeking Education and Joining the Army</h3>
<p>丨Letter from Mr. Zhou Min'an of Shaoxing丨</p>
<p>Dear Editor,</p>
<p>I am a young man who has lost the opportunity to study due to economic pressures and environmental constraints! I graduated from elementary school two years ago, and I really wanted to go to middle school, but I couldn't! My family is so poor that they can't even make a living, so how can they afford to send me to school? After graduation, I didn't have a proper job, so I wandered around every day, wasting my precious time in the word "wandering." My mother is a thoughtful person, and she thought that if I kept playing like this, I would only be consuming and not earning. So, she ordered me to go to the mountains near our home to collect firewood, or to help others, even if it was just to get a meal or a dime. But my education was neglected! Sometimes, I would try to steal some time from my work to study, but my mother would scold me, saying that I was lazy and that reading books was useless. Sadly, I had to put down my books and do other things. Sometimes, I would go to the mountains to chop wood, secretly hiding a few textbooks that I had already read under the firewood basket. After chopping the wood, I would sit on the mountain and read. I would only stop when it was getting dark. This continued until last autumn. Later, someone recommended me to work as an apprentice in a small pharmacy in Shanghai. However, the store closed down due to losses, and I lost my job and returned home. Now? I can only steal some time from my work to read your newspaper every day (for the shortest period of time). (Because when I was in school, the school also subscribed to your newspaper. After class, I considered your newspaper my only companion. Since the September 18th Incident two years ago, I have been sharing a subscription to your newspaper with others.) The rest of the time, I work as a laborer to solve the problem of food. But my desire to study has not died. Sometimes, when I see the recruitment advertisements of various schools in the newspaper, I almost cry! And I stare enviously at those纨绔 children who go from elementary school to middle school! I am so envious! Sometimes, I think to myself: They are human beings, and I am a human being, and we live in the same society. How can they have the blessing of receiving education? Alas! Why can't I even afford a correspondence school (such as the Kaiming Correspondence Middle School and others)? Even if I want to study on my own, Heaven doesn't give me enough time, and I don't have the ability to buy ordinary self-study reference books. Besides the textbooks I read before and old novels such as Romance of the Eastern and Western Han Dynasties, Xue Rengui Conquers the East, Seven Heroes and Five Gallants, and Biography of the Loyal Martyrs, there is nothing else in my home! Sir, in my situation, what methods can I use to study?</p>
<p>Also, I think that if I really don't have the opportunity to study, then I am the most pitiful person in the world! What is the point of living? I might as well commit suicide. However, now that the country is in crisis, it is better to join the army than to commit suicide! Moreover, the enemy has already invaded our Hebei, and Peiping and Tianjin are in danger. Joining the army and going north to die for the country is more valuable than committing suicide! Sir, do you think joining the army is okay? Please use your vast talent and rich experience to solve these two problems for me in your column.</p>
<p>Reply will be published tomorrow.</p>
<p>Recently, Mr. He Ju of Shaoxing wrote a letter, saying that he had spent several years and countless efforts to invent a kind of thermos bottle based on scientific principles, which can keep heat for ten days and keep cold for one month, and its effect is far better than any thermos bottle sold on the market. However, due to lack of capital, he cannot set up a factory to manufacture it by himself. He intends to seek cooperation from domestic industrialists or sell the invention rights. He asked this newspaper to introduce it on his behalf. This newspaper believes that it is a pity if Mr. He's invention is not made known to the world, so it is happy to publish the introduction as above. If domestic industrialists are interested in this, they can directly contact Mr. He in Dongguan, Shaoxing.</p>

<h3>The Year of Domestic Goods at a Critical Juncture</h3>
<p>— Yang Yun</p>
<p>Since our National Government implemented the new tariff law on May 22 and raised tariff rates, the most vocal opponents have been Japanese merchants, especially those in the cotton cloth business. They have been holding meetings with Japanese merchants in various ports for days to study countermeasures, even falsely accusing it of being a disguised method of boycotting Japanese goods, believing that Japanese goods have no room for expansion in the world market and that China is the only way out, which must not be let go. They have proposed eight resolutions to protest to our government, stating that if these tariff rates are not revised, not only will cotton yarn merchants be hit, but all Japanese industrial and commercial enterprises in China will be affected, and as a result, Japan's trade with China will decline from now on. This problem is more serious than the Shanghai Incident of last year, and if it is not resolved properly, terrible incidents may occur. At the same time, they are calling on the Japanese government and the Japan Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exporters Association and the Osaka Cotton Cloth Merchants Association to provide the same assistance. The Japanese, who are accustomed to doing business with guns, clearly know that China has the sovereign right to tariff independence and has no legal basis for protest. They insist on using force to intimidate and seek improper solutions, holding meetings here and negotiating there, making unreasonable demands and expanding their unwarranted movement. Minister Yoshizawa has lodged a protest with me, stating that "Your country's increase in tariffs has greatly impacted Japanese trade and harmed Sino-Japanese friendly relations, which is regrettable and respectfully requests reconsideration." Japan's representative to the World Economic Conference, Ishii, pointed out that China's boycott is the biggest obstacle to commerce and will propose a response plan at the Economic Conference. The Japanese, from top to bottom, have long regarded our country as nothing and have nothing to fear, except for this boycott issue. There are no Chinese merchants for Japanese merchants, and the benefit of Japanese goods is the harm of domestic goods. At this critical juncture, why are our domestic goods merchants indifferent and unmoved, allowing the Japanese to use their ghostly tricks to destroy the dying vitality of our domestic goods? If you don't believe me, please tell me about the recent false accusations against domestic goods merchants. On the 24th of this month, a Shanghai newspaper published a headline saying "A Certain Society, the Source of the Shanghai Incident, Suddenly Purchased Japanese Yarn, and the Boycott of Japanese Goods Is Gradually Coming to an End," which stated that "Huang Fu entered Beiping and the ceasefire agreement is about to be established, and the boycott of Japanese goods is also easing, and the future is promising. Since the Manchurian Incident, the Tianjin Gang, the Qingdao Gang, and the Qinhuangdao Gang, as well as the Shanghai business community, are still in the midst of boycotting goods, but recently, they have gradually started purchasing Japanese yarn and cloth. What is most noteworthy is that a certain society with the strongest Kuomintang color and the direct cause of the Shanghai Incident has also been rumored to have purchased Japanese yarn. If the leader of this boycott has flattered Japanese yarn, then the Shanghai boycott movement seems to be coming to an end." The Japanese clearly know that a certain society has its own yarn factory in Hangzhou, spinning and weaving by itself, without the need to seek outside help, so they do not hesitate to create this absurd and unfounded rumor. Their purpose is (1) to seduce the public and deceive ignorant Chinese merchants, so as to strengthen their psychology of purchasing Japanese goods, thinking that the leader of the boycott has no courage to boycott, then the other factories and shops can purchase them. (2) The cotton cloth industry has been the hardest hit by Japanese commercial attacks in China. Tracing back to the beginning, since a certain society was founded in the early years of the Republic of China, cotton cloth factories have sprung up like mushrooms, enough to boycott Japanese goods invisibly, which is most hated by the Japanese. Therefore, they say "the strongest Kuomintang color" and "the leader of the boycott," doing their best to slander and exclude them, and their fierce and vicious purpose is to put our domestic goods merchants to death. Regular troops and surprise troops are advancing simultaneously, but our domestic goods merchants, except for the society itself negotiating with the newspaper, are indifferent and let the Japanese use their tricks without any assistance or expression? I believe that today's domestic goods merchants should make the greatest determination, stand firm and clear the fields, and strictly implement the following measures to save themselves and the country.</p>
<p>(1) Unanimously support the new tariffs and express to the government that the autonomy of tariffs must not be compromised in the slightest.</p>
<p>(2) Automatically organize inspection agencies and report each other to prevent Japanese goods from being smuggled in to damage the development of domestic goods. Nor should the Japanese be allowed to make false accusations to slander pure domestic goods merchants.</p>
<p>(3) Pay attention to mail delivery. It is heard that recently Japanese goods have invaded the interior, mostly by mail, and it is heard that they are delivered from places such as Nanxiang, and many foreign commercial ships along the Yangtze River have their own postal services. This kind of transportation is countless.</p>
<p>(4) Alas, the anti-Japanese war is powerless, and the agreement is about to be concluded. The fate of the country is at this point, and the whole country is heartbroken. If my domestic goods merchants do not have this determination and let the Japanese scold us as Chinese merchants who are blinded by greed (as the Daily News says), then the life of the domestic goods industry will end in this Year of Domestic Goods. This is truly a cause for weeping and sighing.</p>
<p>Talks on Domestic Goods</p>
<h3>Stability</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>The word "stability" originally came from Buddhism. Its meaning is to first have specialized thought and then hold on to a firm determination. This is called "stability." People in the new era who read these words of mine will say that I am outdated. Then, of course, I will not admit it, because, to put it more broadly, from national affairs to family trifles, there is a great truth between these two words "stability." The current political chaos, diplomatic humiliation, and family disputes are all due to the lack of stability of those who bear great responsibility.</p>
<p>If we have a firm will to carry out something, although it may not be successful immediately, but with such a determination, even if there are some setbacks in the middle, future success is certain. If you feel disheartened when you encounter a slight setback, thinking that "the future is bleak and there is no hope," and even stop halfway, then your disappointment will be ten thousand times more painful than if you had not carried out something.</p>
<p>We don't need to talk about national affairs. What I want to talk about now is the greatest responsibility at the moment, which is the issue of domestic goods. I fundamentally oppose the saying "Chinese people should promote Chinese goods." You would think that people of a country should naturally purchase products from their own country to prevent money from flowing out. This is a matter of course, but in China, you cannot say this. Since the opening of the sea ban, foreign goods have been shipped to China in thousands of boxes. Curious Chinese people have flocked to them, accumulating a long history of nearly a hundred years, which has created the current situation: "Foreign goods sell well, domestic goods are sluggish." Ordinary domestic goods manufacturers and enthusiastic patriots compete to chant the slogan of "promoting domestic goods." I remember in 1915, after the Japanese forced Yuan Shikai to sign the Twenty-One Demands, I also formed a patriotic ten-person group with my friends, promoting the boycott of enemy goods. At that time, I fundamentally opposed the word "promote" in "promoting domestic goods." It would be more accurate to say "practical use" rather than "promote," because "promote" is an abstract noun. Whether you promote it or not, when it comes to "practical use," you must use it practically. It seems to be more accurate than promotion.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the word "stability" again. In the late Qing Dynasty, wasn't the Anchor brand towel very popular in the market? In the early years of the Republic of China, the XX Industrial Company in Shanghai, seeing that their towels were selling so well in the market, implemented a boycott and produced a towel with better material than the Anchor brand to boycott it. Sure enough, in less than a year, Anchor products were greatly affected and eventually became unsustainable and disappeared. Anchor also had a Double Cats brand of matches, which also went crazy in the Chinese market. Later, the Chinese XX factory produced goods to boycott it, and it suffered the same fate as the Anchor brand towels. Just looking at these two daily necessities, are there still traces of Anchor goods in the Chinese market today? I think no matter what, they will not be found again.</p>
<p>Why do the towels of the Chinese XX Industrial Company and the matches of the XX factory have such amazing miracles? In the end, there is nothing else, just the benefits of implementing based on "stability."</p>
<p>You should know that the success of a cause is not simple. Zeng Wenzheng Gong said: "Don't ask about future harvests, but ask about current cultivation." Harvest is a future matter that cannot be seen; cultivation is a present matter. Whether you are diligent or not, whether you are patient or not. If you do it based on stability, without the slightest懈怠, you will always achieve the goal of success.</p>
<p>Since "stability" is so important for producers, can we consumers be casual and without stability at all? No, no, consumers need "stability" as much as producers. If you buy casually, isn't that a big obstacle for producers? General consumers! First, recognize "our era"! Second, take on "our responsibility"! Finally, connect them together and complete them in one breath, and everyone "actually use domestic goods"! From today onwards, keep doing this in a practical way, and never look back. Because one glance will make you lose all your previous efforts. From the 4th year of the Republic of China to now, there have been many excellent examples. The effect of this fact is all based on the word "stability."</p>
<h3>The Laborer and the Capitalist</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Now: Everyone knows that silk factories have been defeated miserably. However: There are the most laborers. The largest-scale yarn factory. It is also being stirred up by evil merchants acting as accomplices, the demon of dumping into the Chinese mainland 丨Japanese yarn丨. Coupled with the government's failure to promptly implement dumping taxes, reduce unified tax rates and freight rates, and encourage cotton planting, the yarn factory is finally forced to reduce work and move towards decline. The lives of hundreds of thousands of laborers are gradually hanging upside down! Alas! In the eventful month of May, we hope that laborers will stand on the same front as capitalists, work hard, and create a bright path. Capitalists are painstakingly planning to maintain your lives. If labor and capital can work together to resist foreign aggression, and be as strong as steel and cement, then the Chinese market belongs to China, and laborers are the basic force of domestic goods. In the future, when foreign goods are defeated, laborers will be especially meritorious and worthy of everyone's praise.</p>
<h3>The Problem of Reducing Work in Yarn Factories</h3>
<p>— Qiu Guangting</p>
<p>Laborers are employed by factories to engage in production; factories are places where laborers exchange labor for money to support their lives. Factories rely on the strength of laborers to complete their production, and laborers rely on the gains from factory production to supply their lives. If laborers do not exert their ability to engage in production, the production volume will be thin, and the price of finished products will be high, making them incomparable to factories with superior production, and the business will tend to decline. If you want production to advance to superior, you must employ more laborers. When the number of laborers increases, and the wages per piece of finished product are fixed, the wages per person must decrease due to the increase in the total number of people. If wages are low, it is difficult for laborers to have a good life individually. If factories need to maintain a minimum standard of living for individuals, they must provide considerable wages. The total cost of wages always exceeds the standard wage per piece and is more than those with fewer people and higher wages. Since the rationalization of work was advocated in various advanced industrial countries, everyone has been striving to reduce consumption and increase production. They have simplified complex projects so that they can maximize production with the least amount of effort, and they have eliminated wasteful consumption to reduce power and manpower. To the extreme, the need for labor has been reduced, and the number of laborers needed has also decreased. Old factories want to keep pace with them to avoid being eliminated, so there has been a recent trend of laying off workers. However, the standard of living has been advancing over the years, and if wages do not increase, laborers cannot have a good life. If wages increase and the number of people does not decrease, the increase in wages will increase the number of people, and the finished products will inevitably be difficult to sell due to increased consumption, which is also a burden that factories cannot bear. To seek both, the only way is to give full play to the ability of laborers, reduce the number of people, laborers can exert their ability to achieve the success of both people with the strength of one person, factories give high wages, encourage their ability, laborers may be happy in their work because of the possibility, factories can also reduce the number of people and reduce the payment of wages.</p>
<p>Taking textile factories as an example, there are more than 4 million spindles in the country, of which 2.4 million spindles are operated by Chinese people themselves, and 1.8 million spindles are operated by Japanese people. I believe that the imperfect tax system is not enough to protect factories operated by Chinese people themselves, causing them to prosper. The imperfect social organization cannot maintain each other, causing the spinning industry to develop. Political instability and fluctuating public sentiment are all direct and indirect reasons why the textile industry cannot be promoted. The large number of laborers and the large payment of wages violate the principles of rationalization of production and cannot be compared with Japanese factories in China. From cleaning cotton to fine spinning, Japanese factories require an average of 140 laborers per 10,000 spindles, while Chinese factories in Shanghai require 220 laborers. Counting the work of shaking yarn and maintenance, Japanese factories require about 250 people, and Chinese factories in Shanghai require about 310 people. A certain factory in Nantong requires more than 800 laborers per 10,000 spindles on average. Recently, due to the collapse of the rural economy and weak purchasing power, coupled with the dumping of Japanese goods, the inventory of each factory has been huge. The Chinese Cotton Yarn Factory Association has resolved to reduce work to reduce inventory and to reorganize internally, reduce excessive consumption, and reduce costs, so as not to be exploited by their dumping policy and still be able to survive. Tongchang has just started planning to realize the resolution due to the requirements of the times, but the laborers have already started a strike. For a while, the public opinion is divided, with some saying that they do not care about the livelihoods of the laborers. They do not know that Mou Factory's layoffs are actually seeking its own survival, and also to give full play to the abilities of those who are not laid off, and increase their benefits. The talents bestowed by heaven are not different, only in the good use of them. If you use your talent well, the more you use it, the more obvious your ability will be. If you do not use it well, you will become lazy, and what is the use of being many? Japanese factories only need 250 laborers per 10,000 spindles, Shanghai factories need 300 laborers, and to say that the 800 laborers per 10,000 spindles in Tongchang cannot be laid off, wouldn't it be cultivating the habit of laziness, making them become useless people in the world?</p>
<h3>Where Are the Achievements of the National Products Movement?</h3>
<p>— Lian Ru</p>
<p>Although some people, driven by patriotic fervor, enthusiastically advocate for national products, there are indeed many unawakened, walking-dead compatriots, no, cold-blooded creatures; if you go to the street to take a survey, it won't take ten minutes, and I guarantee you'll get a shocking number: nine out of ten people are wearing foreign goods, especially those who consider themselves the backbone of the nation – the youth.</p>
<p>The passage of time cannot be stopped. More than five months of the National Products Year have already hurried by. But what are the achievements of promoting national products? How much have imports of foreign goods decreased? This is a painful matter. Please see the recent customs report:</p>
<p>This Year's March Excess of Imports: National Currency 101,747,420 Yuan</p>
<p>Last Year's January to March Excess of Imports: National Currency 185,364,862 Yuan</p>
<p>This Year's January to March Excess of Imports: National Currency 204,532,770 Yuan</p>
<p>During the National Products Year, in these days of national demise, in just three months, there has been an excess of imports of more than 204.5 million yuan. If this is extrapolated to the whole year, then this year, more than 818.18 million yuan will flow out of the country. If this money were used to buy airplanes, calculated at 150,000 yuan per plane, then 5,454 planes could be purchased.</p>
<p>According to investigations from various sources, the biggest reason is that people are happy to use foreign fabrics. But have the majority of people, the important figures and their concubines, capitalists and social merchants, teachers and students, truly awakened? They still need to examine themselves.</p>
<p>Finally, with personal enthusiasm, I implore the adults and gentlemen to use national products, to dispel my calculations, to stop just paying lip service, and to implement genuine national salvation work – promote national products. Otherwise, just wait to become slaves of a fallen nation when the Japanese soldiers arrive!</p>
<h3>Investigation of Our Country's Calcium Carbonate Manufacturing Industry (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>Investigation of Industrial Raw Materials</p>
<p>(2) Da Zhonghua Calcium Factory: The Da Zhonghua Calcium Factory can be considered an affiliated business of the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory. The factory is located on Xujiahui Road, with capital increased from 100,000 to 150,000 yuan. Manager Xue Fuji has been doing business in Japan for many years and has considerable experience in the chemical industry. Manager Zhu Weichen is also very capable and decisive in his work. Xue Fuji also serves as the manager of Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory, so he often has the opportunity to inspect and experiment with the products himself. Currently, the Double Coin brand calcium carbonate produced by the factory is bright white in color and relatively pure in composition. The factory's manufacturing method was entirely imported from Japan, and now it can finally be said to have achieved "success"! The factory's output is 300 bags per day (each bag weighs 112 pounds), totaling more than 30,000 pounds. Most of it is supplied to the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory for use, and not much is sold on the market.</p>
<p>(3) Xinye Chemical Factory: Xinye Chemical Factory is located at Zhaofeng Road, Rihui Port, with a separate distribution office at 692 Niuzhuang Road. Most of the factory's products are supplied to the Yisheng Rubber Factory. Chairman Feng Liansheng is a major shareholder in Yisheng Rubber Factory. Manager Chen Xiaoping worked at Mei Foo for more than ten years and is very shrewd and capable. The factory's manufacturing method is modeled after the Japanese style with some Western European elements, but it can be said that it has not yet been fully successful. The factory's output is currently 70 to 80 bags per day (each bag weighs 50 pounds), weighing approximately 4,000 pounds. In addition to being used by the Yisheng Factory to manufacture galoshes, very little is sold on the market. However, according to the factory's负责人, they plan to purchase more machinery to increase production.</p>
<p>In addition to the above three factories, there is also a Dali Hua Calcium Factory in Huzhou, Zhejiang, and a Bohai Chemical Factory in Tianjin, but their scale is not very large, so their output is also small. Due to space constraints, I will not describe them in detail here.</p>
<p>As for Japanese calcium carbonate sold in our country, because it contains one-third lime, the selling price is low. There are still many factories that do not understand chemical testing,贪图便宜, and are drinking poison to quench their thirst! According to a recent survey, the sales volume of Japanese calcium carbonate in China is still as high as 4,000 to 5,000 bags per month, accounting for about one-quarter of the total output of domestic products. On the one hand, it is hoped that our country's calcium factories will continue to work hard! On the other hand, it is especially hoped that factories purchasing enemy goods will quickly awaken themselves and switch to using domestic goods!</p>

<p>Contributing Opinions</p>
<h3>Contributions to the National Products Company</h3>
<p>— Song Tang</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the China National Products Company, several months have passed in the blink of an eye, and the business is thriving, which is enough to show that the people of the country have a strong patriotic heart, which is gratifying and commendable. However, what I have heard and seen still has shortcomings, and it is like a bone stuck in my throat, eager to spit it out for relief. I humbly serve in a national products factory, and I am even more closely related, so I have to sincerely offer my advice:</p>
<p>(1) Pricing Issue: No matter who it is, even if they recognize and use national products, if the same type of national products have different prices, they will of course buy the cheaper one. This kind of situation is not considered strange in ordinary stores, but it is a great pity that the same product has different prices. If this happens, the customer's loss is limited, but the reputation of the National Products Company is greatly affected. Customers who come are all here for the name, and they already have a sense of trust. When they buy something and go out, they see the same type of product in the street shops selling for a lower price, wouldn't they be greatly disappointed? How can they be expected to come again? The company may not be able to carefully distinguish each item because of the many items and the busy affairs. The pricing of the National Products Company is indeed a matter of attention, and the prices of various stores on the market should be investigated and compared at any time, and then the purchase price should be calculated. If other stores can sell it, the company can do the same. It would be better if it could be lower, but at the very least, it should be based on the lowest price of each store on the market.</p>
<p>(2) Display of Goods: The display of goods in the National Products Company is messy and uneven. Although it is said that this is due to the busy business, it is best to browse through them at any time and fold and organize them immediately. After developing this habit, the appearance will be much better. Moreover, when customers choose goods, it is easier to deal with, and it also saves many procedures for inventory, so as to avoid wasting time.</p>
<p>(3) Neat Attire: As for the counter clerks and trainees who approach customers, in addition to the courtesy and attitude that should be observed, for the attire, it is not necessary to be expensive, but to be neat and clean, which should also be paid attention to by everyone.</p>
<p>(4) Meal Bell Reform: A friend of mine said that one day at noon, he went to the National Products Company to buy some odds and ends, and suddenly heard the bell ringing loudly. The customers didn't know why and were all panicked. When asked, it turned out to be the meal bell. If the three companies used an eight-tone steel plate, circling around once, the sound would be more elegant, and the electricity and installation costs would also be saved. The south is currently expanding. Ways should be found to change it.</p>
<p>(5) Discount Issue: Discount methods are the only way for stores and companies in Shanghai recently to attract customers. However, the entire great China National Products Company should have a certain period of time and should not give discounts too often. It should adhere to the principle of preferring low prices to frequent discounts, so as not to lose credibility.</p>
<p>Moreover, the purity and cleanliness of the quality, the agility of the packaging, and the speed and accuracy of the payment procedures are what customers hope for, and the company should pay attention to them.</p>
<p>National Products Introduction</p>
<h3>Introducing the National Products Mobile Promotion Team</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>In this National Products Year, on the surface in Shanghai, it seems to be booming and at its peak, but everyone's goals seem to be concentrated in a few large cities, and the most numerous consumers in the villages of various places have been ignored. If you go to the countryside, you will see advertisements for enemy goods everywhere on the leaning walls and broken fences, but you can't find any propaganda for national products. Watching the import of enemy goods flowing in continuously, the cotton textiles and daily necessities used by rural farmers belong to enemy goods, accounting for more than 80%. This is such a painful thing.</p>
<p>Recently, several people enthusiastic about national products in Shanghai, under the guidance of the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperative Association, initiated a China National Products Mobile Promotion Team, using ships and vehicles to display samples of national products, traveling through cities, towns, and villages, so that national products can be sold well inland and penetrate into the people. Now, using two merchant ships, they are proceeding successively to the villages and towns of Jiading, Nanxiang, Taicang, Kunshan, and Changshu. The ships are equipped with the latest type of wireless radio. When traveling or arriving at a certain place, they play music at any time to attract the local people's attention. Every time the merchant ship arrives at a place, it distributes invitations, inviting people from all walks of life and business leaders to visit the ship, offering tea and snacks to induce those who love to use national products to buy. The promotion steps start with investigation. When first going to a new route for trial sales, every time it arrives at a place, the promoters go to various stores to investigate the best-selling goods and their prices and record them for reference. They also invite the people in charge of each store to visit the ship to see the samples, and offer tea and snacks to facilitate contact. At the same time, spot and order transactions are carried out. They are determined to abandon the metropolitan market and let other comrades do it, while they focus on the propaganda and promotion in the countryside, bringing national products into the people, so that they can clearly identify national products and more deeply understand the meaning of purchasing and using national products. The factories also strive to make the national products suitable for the needs of customers. The team is in the middle between the factories and the customers, so that the production and sales sides can communicate with each other. They are all very satisfied and gradually achieve the desire to eliminate all foreign goods. The team is carrying this important mission, and I am happy to introduce it.</p>
<h3>What Nationality Are You?</h3>
<p>— Yu Qiacheng</p>
<p>Children's World</p>
<p>The spring dusk, with the warmth of early summer, the setting sun shines into the Puyi Society's kindergarten, this scene is already old news, but the impression is still very new.</p>
<p>The speech was about education; the discussion was about family. The old educator Huang Renzhi, he never wanted to make those little babies who came with their ayis feel lonely, so he had a fifteen-minute children's talk, which was a meaningful, valuable, and interesting children's</p>
<h3>Children's National Products Song</h3>
<p>— Nan Gong</p>
<p>Good brothers, little brothers. Encourage each other, rise up together! Use national products, wear cloth clothes! Both strong and economical! Everyone must remember.</p>
<p>National products movement. If you want to know the details, please wait for me to use a narrative drama to illustrate!</p>
<p>Time: A spring dusk</p>
<p>Location: Puyi Society Kindergarten</p>
<p>Characters: Two rows of low stools are arranged in a circle, with thirty children in the front row and fifty housewives in the back row (perhaps a few ladies who are prospective housewives), Mr. Huang stands at one end of the room.</p>
<p>When the curtain opens, Mr. Huang has already talked about "How to Be a Parent."</p>
<p>Huang: I am now going to take fifteen minutes to talk to the children, okay?</p>
<p>Children: (Some put down their candy, some raised their tired heads, and all cheered up to listen to the development of the talk.)</p>
<p>Huang: What nationality are you?</p>
<p>Children: Chinese!</p>
<p>Huang: Is China strong or weak now?</p>
<p>A: Not very strong!</p>
<p>Huang: Why is China weak? I'm afraid you don't understand. Let me tell you, although there are many reasons, one of the biggest reasons is that Chinese people don't like to use Chinese goods, and the money is taken away by others.</p>
<p>Children: (A little silent)</p>
<p>Huang: Last year's battle in Zhabei, Shanghai, the rumbling cannons, have you forgotten?</p>
<p>Children: No!</p>
<p>Huang: Which country came to attack us?</p>
<p>Child A: The Japanese.</p>
<p>Huang: Why did they attack us?</p>
<p>Child A: Because we don't buy Japanese goods.</p>
<p>Huang: Why do they want us to buy Japanese goods? Let me tell you, they use Japanese goods to exchange for our money, making us poor and them rich, making us weak and them strong, and then making us perish as a poor and weak nation.</p>
<p>Children: (Silent for a little longer)</p>
<p>Huang: Which country's goods do you like?</p>
<p>Children: Chinese goods.</p>
<p>Huang: Why do you like Chinese goods?</p>
<p>Children: Because we are Chinese!</p>
<p>Huang: Good, children, Chinese people use Chinese goods! From now on, whether it's clothing, food, housing, or transportation, we will use more domestic goods, so that the country can be rich and strong, and everyone can avoid being slaves of a fallen nation!</p>
<p>Children: (Unanimous shout) We use Chinese goods!</p>
<p>Author's note: This is a fact, because it is different from general records, and there has been no opportunity to ask Mr. Huang Renzhi to revise it, so there are some imperfections in the wording, which the author is of course responsible for.</p>
<h3>My Younger Brother's Letter</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shanxiu</p>
<p>After spending my days with monotonous work, I always like to play with my little brother's photos or look at his letters; although the photos don't speak and the letters are seemingly coherent but not quite, they always eliminate my boredom invisibly. Today, as usual, I was flipping through the letter he gave me last week when my classmate Li said next to me, "Go get it, your brother has another letter. What are you doing with the old one?" I stood up to go get it, but the porter had already sent it in. Opening it up, it was written in Yan style calligraphy, with childish words, neatly written on two pages:</p>
<p>Brother Xiu:</p>
<p>Another week without greetings, I miss you very much. We have been very busy these days. Mr. Zhao, our physical education teacher, is taking us to tea shops in various villages and towns to give speeches about the harms of using foreign goods. My throat is already a little hoarse, but I don't feel any pain at all. On the contrary, I feel very happy because many people can be moved by us and nod their heads in agreement. We took this opportunity to organize a Nian Er Society, which is the name Mr. Zhao gave us. The society has established many rules: (1) Use local goods. (2) Do not smoke cigarettes. (3) Do not wear Western suits. (4) Do not apply cosmetics. Although the rules are very strict, many people have joined, and they have all sworn to practice them for life. Brother Xiu: You always dislike the ignorance of the villagers. Every time you go to the city, you must bring back some red and green foreign goods. Now that they have awakened, you can stop disliking them, right? I think they are all amiable, and they seem to be very affectionate towards me. Who says the hearts of Chinese people are dead? In addition to being role models ourselves, we continue to advise the villagers during our spare time, hoping that one day the false foreign goods will disappear. Brother Xiu: I really hope that you can also gather comrades to organize a</p>
<p>The propaganda team is about to set off again, goodbye.</p>
<p>Your beloved brother Xinnong</p>
<p>After reading this letter, I simply forgot the hunger pangs in my stomach. What a lovely angel he is! I still remember when he was six years old, he saw Pusheng from the neighbor's house playing with a foreign doll, and he also made a fuss about buying one. I had no choice but to buy one for him. He happily threw away his Maoshan trumpet and became friends with the foreign doll. Not long after, he accidentally fell, and his foreign doll was also crushed. He was very annoyed, and my father said, "This is a useless foreign product, do you still want it?" He quickly picked up the discarded Maoshan trumpet and turned his head without looking at the foreign doll. It has been seven years since this happened. Whenever he hears the word foreign goods, he always shows a contemptuous expression and often warns his little friends not to buy foreign goods. How could he know that we already have a Nian Er Society organization, and where did their Mr. Zhao come up with the name Nian Er Society? However, his earnest attitude is full of his words. My love for him lies in this point.</p>
<p>Compatriots, when you finish reading this short message that is not very smooth, you should be moved, right?</p>
<h3>A Collection of Small Q&amp;As</h3>
<p>— Yi Ju</p>
<p>Q: Why should we use national products?</p>
<p>A: Because we are Chinese, so we should use national products.</p>
<p>Q: National products may not be as satisfactory as foreign products, right?</p>
<p>A: That's right, national products do have shortcomings compared to foreign products, but in terms of durability, foreign products are much inferior. Moreover, recently, national products have been gradually improving and progressing. In the future, there will always be a day when they can compete with foreign products, which is what we expect.</p>
<p>Q: There are some things that national products don't have, how do you explain that?</p>
<p>A: If there are national products, use national products. If there are no national products, use national product substitutes. Even if the price is slightly higher, you should grit your teeth and endure the pain for a while.</p>
<p>Q: If there really isn't any, what should we do?</p>
<p>A: You can not use it and try to save it. If you really can't save it, you have to buy foreign goods, but we must recognize our biggest enemy at present - Japan. No matter what, their goods must not be bought and used, and this must be remembered.</p>
<p>Q: If the people can all buy and use national products, will it really help the country?</p>
<p>A: Of course, this is absolutely unquestionable! I believe that if the people can all buy and use national products with one heart and firm will, in less than three years, they will definitely achieve great results, which depends on how hard the people work!</p>
<p>Q: Is it enough to just use national products? What else should we do?</p>
<p>A: When you are satisfied with using national products, you should widely promote their advantages among relatives and friends and persuade them to try them. The effect is ten thousand times higher than advertising. After a long time, foreign goods will inevitably be squeezed out of the market. When you are dissatisfied, you should point out the shortcomings to the producing factories and urge them to improve, so that the goods can be improved and sold without obstacles. This is the attitude that our people should have, and it also shows the degree of enthusiasm of our people in advocating national products.</p>
<p>Q: Where should the promotion of national products start?</p>
<p>A: Start with oneself, the family, and then extend to relatives and friends.</p>
<p>Q: Thank you, I am very grateful to you for pointing out so many good intentions.</p>
<p>A: It goes without saying, I am promoting national products!</p>
<h3>A National Products Fashion in Wuxi</h3>
<p>— Zhu Shanxiu</p>
<p>In Wuxi - the little Shanghai of Wuxi - your eardrums can be constantly vibrated by the majestic sound of steam whistles, most of which are emitted from yarn factories. In this way, it seems that the clothing of ordinary people in Wuxi should be devoid of imported goods. However, the reality is not what we imagine. When we walk on the street, the kind of strange clothing - especially Western suits - also constantly stabs into your eyes, making you think of the future of national products - this is really a very painful thing. Fortunately, there is now a somewhat satisfactory news, and I will introduce it to you;</p>
<p>Some of the Western-suited young people who still have blood in their veins have admitted their past sins. They say that they each spent at least seventy or eighty yuan of national currency a year on clothing, and they have now resolved to use national products. Therefore, recently, on the street, you can see young people wearing Shilin cloth shirts on the upper body, yellow twill Western-style trousers on the lower body - the fabrics are produced by factories such as Shenxin Qingfeng Guangqin, etc., wearing sanitary shirts from Wuhua Factory inside, and wearing basketball shoes from Brothers Company on their feet, coming and going in groups of two or three. The coolness that had already cooled down has risen again. Originally, it would be best to use national clothing styles when using national products, but please forgive them, they are already accustomed to Western clothing, and it is not an instant matter to suddenly change over. In short, this national products fashion movement may not be a ray of dawn for the future of the national products industry; to put it another way, it is better than nothing after all.</p>
<p>Brief News: To Mr. Shao Ding and Mr. Bing Yue: The Adding and Subtracting, Multiplying and Dividing Calculator Manufacturing Office is located at No. 1447, Hartung Road, Jing'an Temple Road. The machine is currently being improved and manufactured, so the price has not yet been determined. (Editor)</p>
<h3>Hopes for National Products Factories</h3>
<p>— Xu Nangong</p>
<p>National products have been promoted for many years, but the flood of foreign goods in the market has increased rather than decreased. The amount of excess imports in the annual customs statistics has only risen without the slightest decline. Is this because there is a lack of national product production, or because the price is high and the quality is poor? But if we go to various national product markets to observe, the various goods displayed inside, such as silk fabrics, household goods, woolen fabrics, all utensils, their superior quality and low prices, although may not be fully satisfactory, are enough to compete with imported goods. Therefore, the crux of the matter is not in production, but in the lack of widespread use. The reason for the lack of widespread use is the manufacturers' lack of effort in promotion and the lack of a spirit of unity, which is an undeniable fact.</p>
<p>In the past, most manufacturers were confined to one corner and did not engage in external development. Therefore, when many businesses gathered together, they caused mutual infighting due to conflicts of interest, using all their energy for overt and covert struggles among themselves, and had no time to take care of the outside world. This drawback was enough to disperse their strength. Because of the continuous internal strife, foreign goods took the opportunity to invade. Therefore, the inability of national products to be widespread, although there are various reasons for obstruction, manufacturers should bear considerable responsibility.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must correct the past mistakes in the future and shift the energy of fighting among businesses to external expansion, which is an urgent need for national product factories. Because of the lack of external promotion, the people have no way of knowing, and even if they want to purchase them, they do not know whether national products are produced, or even are deceived by unscrupulous merchants by changing their appearance. Therefore, the current national product factories, in addition to striving for excellence in their products, especially need to focus on publicity, such as organizing national product groups, going to various places to exhibit, so that the public can recognize them, and establishing more retail outlets to give buyers convenience, so as not to be deceived by unscrupulous merchants. They must seek to integrate production and sales to complement each other, so that national products can flow continuously and be sold throughout the country.</p>
<p>During this period when the call for promoting national products is permeating the country, I sincerely hope that our national product factories will change direction and take the broad road, go deep inland to promote sales, and seek our vast market. Don't just be mutually 火进 in a narrow space!</p>

<h3>Annual Meeting of the Chinese Economic Society to Discuss</h3>
<p>Methods for Improving and Resolving the Chinese Economy</p>
<p>The 10th annual meeting of the Chinese Economic Society is scheduled to be held in Qingdao from August 21st to 28th. The board of directors has appointed Li Zhaoshi as the chairman of this year's thesis committee, with Liu Dajun and Li Shi as vice-chairmen, and Ma Yinchu, He Dekui, He Lian, Fang Ting, Shou Jingwei, Liu Binglin, Yang Duanliu, Zhu Shikang, etc. as members. The various committee members have recently agreed on a general outline for theses, which is on issues related to the improvement of the Chinese economy and their solutions. The committee's first notice has been distributed to the members, and is transcribed as follows: Since the 19th century, the European and American industrial revolutions have developed rapidly, and economic aggression has become increasingly rampant. All political and religious forces have also expanded accordingly. Our country's closed-door policy was impacted and could no longer be maintained. Seventy or eighty years ago, if the authorities had been able to clearly understand the general trend of the world, adopt new learning and advanced ideas, such as the proposals of Mr. Rong Hong, reform education, revitalize industry, seek to increase social production, and build a national economy, then our country's revitalization efforts would not have lagged behind our eastern neighbor. Moreover, if the social elites of that day had not been preoccupied with fame and wealth, but had engaged in the overall transformation of productive enterprises, and the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors had obtained sufficient talent to actively promote development, then in the world's economic evolution, our Chinese nation would not have fallen behind to this extreme. Only Korea, which had regarded the national economy and people's livelihood at that time, eventually suffered from the oppression and aggression of imperialists and could do nothing about it. This is something we cannot help but feel deeply saddened about. In the past, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, recognizing this, advocated the Principle of People's Livelihood and promoted the Industrial Plan, deeply desiring to fundamentally remedy this collapsing national economy, but he passed away before seeing its implementation. Those in the know say that his plan has recently been tested in Soviet Russia and has achieved obvious results. In our country, it is even more urgent to seek its realization. Economy is the driving force behind all undertakings. All aspects of livelihood, politics, education, construction, and national defense rely on the economy for advancement. Therefore, in modern times, countries often use economic aggression to develop their national power. The importance of the economy has surpassed that of politics. Now, within our country, the people's livelihood is in decline, and externally, we are surrounded by strong enemies, and the economic decline is indescribable. We do not need to talk about international development, but to seek appropriate survival and establish ourselves in the world's progress, the transformation of the economy cannot be delayed. These are all the responsibilities of us economists. Therefore, we propose that the general outline of the annual meeting's theses be "Issues and Solutions for the Current Economic Transformation of China." We hope that the members of the society will express their great opinions on this issue for discussion, so that we can use it to establish a great cause of economic revolution and lay the foundation for a strong and prosperous nation. We earnestly urge you to do so. This announcement.</p>
<p>It is reported that all correspondence from the society's thesis committee is received and forwarded by the National Jiaotong University on Haige Road in Shanghai. As of today, more than ninety members of the society have registered with the headquarters to attend the meeting. At that time, the members from the South will gather in Nanjing to travel north together, and the members from the North will gather in Jinan to travel east on the Jiaoji Railway with the members from the South. It is also reported that the society will take the opportunity to inspect the rural construction in Shandong, which has achieved remarkable results, and will invite Qingdao Mayor Shen, Liang Shuming, Wu Dingchang, and Chen Guangfu, the organizers of rural construction in Shandong, to give speeches. The society's headquarters will also present a thesis entitled "Utilization of Foreign Capital and Technology," which will be read by the president's representative. The Hangzhou branch will present a thesis entitled "The Pathological Conditions of Zhejiang's Rural Economy and Their Remedies," which will be read by the branch's directors. However, the topic proposed by the Shanghai branch is still unknown. The majority of the society's members are in Shanghai, and it is expected that they will also present a similar thesis.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Bans Huxi Elementary School in Shanghai</h3>

<p>丨Men's Tennis: District One Wins Over District Three</p>
<p>The men's tennis singles were held at 2:00 PM on the 31st. The first match was between Xu Yubo of District Three and Lu Shunqing of District One. Lu excelled in both smashes and serves, with fast and powerful serves. Xu was small and weak, and his returns were steady, but his strength was limited, making recovery hopeless. As a result, he lost the entire match. The championship also went to District One. The referee was Deng Jiaxiang. First set: 6 to 1, Second set: 6 to 3, Third set: 6 to 1. The second singles match was between Chen Naixin of District One and Shi Zhongxiang. Shi was a student from Provincial Seventh Middle School, while Chen was a veteran tennis player. Shi's skills were shallow, and he was completely defeated. The referee was Zhong Renzhe. First set: 6 to 4, Second set: 6 to 2, Third set: 6 to 2.</p>
<p>Preliminary Round: District Two Forfeits In men's tennis, on the afternoon of the 30th at 3:00 PM, there were originally to be three matches: first singles, doubles, and second singles, all between District One and District Two. However, District Two did not show up at the last minute and forfeited, giving the victory to District One. The players from District One were Wang Guanghan, Ouyang Xuhui, Chen Naixin, Huang Wulong, Shi Geng, and Deng Haodong.</p>
<p>丨Football: District One Wins Big Over District Two</p>
<p>Only District One and District Two participated in the football competition, and the outcome would determine who won the championship. The match started at 3:00 PM sharp on the afternoon of the 30th. District One's team was a selection of elite players from the Aviation and Zhejiang University, full of talent, all of whom were college students, making their strength formidable. District Two centered around the Linhai Public Team, supported by strong players from Baima Lake Chunhui Middle School on either side, making their strength also quite considerable.</p>
<p>First Half: 4 to 0　About ten minutes into the game, Liu Shizan, a short and stout general from District One, received a pass from the rear and scored the first goal with one kick, greatly boosting morale. Facing this dangerous situation, District Two still worked hard to hold on. After about twenty minutes, the stout Liu, again aided by Xue Yongyuan's pass, scored the second goal. Xue Yongyuan then scored a third goal, but it was disallowed due to offside. District Two's goal was fraught with danger, and Xue Yongyuan took advantage again, continuing to hit the target twice. At halftime, District One led 4 to 0.</p>
<p>Second Half: 3 to 3　After the break, District Two regrouped and returned to the field with renewed spirit. After ten minutes of intense play, Jin Huaizhi of District One dribbled deep into the field and scored another goal with a powerful kick. District Two, having traveled from afar, feared being shut out and losing face, so they tried to counterattack. Jian Jiang Qiu Fei of District Two, with the support of Wang Xinxing, shot directly into the net. District Two's team felt like they had taken a dose of stimulant, and their voices shook with vigor, scoring another goal. Jin Huaizhi, District One's speedy forward, was furious and charged forward, successfully scoring a goal. District Two, not wanting to be outdone, launched another attack, shooting fiercely from the corner. Wang Shiduo, District One's goalkeeper, saved five or six dangerous shots, making invaluable contributions. Finally, Wang Xinxing of District Two scored with a long-range shot that the goalkeeper couldn't save. In the second half, District Two had the upper hand with a score of 3 to 2. Overall, District Two maintained a consistent spirit and deserved praise even in defeat. The final score was 6 to 3, with District One winning the championship. The referee was Gao Shangzhi.</p>

<h3>Women's Tennis Demonstration: Three Matches Played</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association: Chinese Team Achieves Victory</h3>
<p>Thirteen to Two Victory Over South Lawn</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles Registration Deadline Today</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Association's A-League opened yesterday afternoon. The Chinese Tennis Association achieved a winning start, defeating South Lawn by a score of thirteen to two. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Qiu Feihai and Liang Deguang (China) defeated Weitma and Hull (South) 6 to 1, 6 to 2, 6 to 0.</p>
<p>(2) Jiang Daozhang and Yu Tianguang (China) defeated P. Madas and Stist (South) 1 to 6, 6 to 2, 6 to 4.</p>
<p>(3) Zheng Zhaojia and Qian Yaobin (China) defeated Ho and Hosmeier (South) 6 to 1, 6 to 2, 6 to 3.</p>

<p>(5) Zheng Zirong and Zhou Huanan (China) defeated Little Weit and Baselie (South) 6 to 1, 6 to 1, 10 to 8.</p>
<p>Chinese Team's Balanced Talent　The Chinese team's talent allocation yesterday was extremely balanced, especially the third group of Zheng and Qian. The first group of Qiu and Liang had no worthy opponents. Liang's serve was excellent, and Yu Tianguang was also good. Jiang Daozhang ultimately lacked finesse. Zhou Guanjun is still from Germany and a follower of Sun Linfang. South Lawn's talent has been scattered, and their strength has been greatly reduced. It was fortunate that they won two sets.</p>
<p>Yesterday's Results　Yesterday, there were a total of four matches, all with one-sided results. It was particularly shocking that the Japanese team defeated the Xiqiao General Association by a score of 14 to 1.</p>

<p>Lin Baohua Goes to Tianjin　Lin Baohua went to Tianjin for some business, so he did not appear yesterday. He will return to Shanghai in about one or two weeks.</p>
<h3>19th Route Army Football Team</h3>
<p>Battle Order Issued</p>
<p>Tomorrow's Battle Against Fudan University</p>
<p>Shanghai United Team Will Prepare for the Match</p>
<p>The 19th Route Army football team came to Shanghai to play a friendly match with the Western League to exchange skills. However, the Western League teams, due to the season being over and difficulty in gathering players, were unable to respond to the challenge. Now, the National Sports Advancement Association is arranging for the Shanghai university teams to compete instead. Yesterday, Fudan University replied, agreeing to hold a competition tomorrow (2nd) at 4:30 PM at the Chinese Baseball Field. Next Tuesday (6th), the Shanghai football stars will form a united team to compete with the 19th Route Army team. It is expected that there will be an excellent performance at that time.</p>
<h3>American Invents Unbreakable Javelin</h3>
<p>(Washington Electric News) The wood used to make javelins for track and field competitions in various countries around the world is not uniform and is not strong, so it is easy to break in the middle of the competition, which is very uneconomical. Now, an employee of the University of Washington in the United States has invented an unbreakable javelin made of fir wood. It has been used several times by the school's track and field coach, Mr. Yan Mengte Sun, who threw it on cement and brick ground for testing, and it was not damaged at all. Now the school plans to request the World Athletics Federation to recognize this javelin and order countries around the world to imitate and use it.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Sports Field Amateur Basketball Team Wins乙Group Championship</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Sports Field Amateur Basketball Tournament held its final match yesterday, with the best team in乙Group One, Kang Yuan, and the best team in乙Group Two, Jianmei, competing for the championship and runner-up of the乙Group. The first half was 8 to 4, and the second half was 11 to 5, for a total of 19 to 9. Jianmei won the final victory and won the championship, while Kang Yuan was the runner-up. The referee was Zhang Longhai.</p>
<h3>Fudan Baseball Team Overcomes John</h3>
<p>Ten to Five</p>
<p>Last year, the Fudan baseball team lost to John. Since then, they have been determined to avenge themselves. The other day (30th), they specially arranged with John's University in Fanwangdu to compete at their field in Jiangwan. After seven innings, in the final inning, Fudan had already defeated John by a score of ten to five, so they stopped playing. It is said that this year's Jiangnan University Baseball Tournament will only be attended by Jiaotong University and Fudan University, and Fudan is most likely to win the championship this year.</p>
<h3>Another Old Man Football Team: The Qingbai Football Club Was Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wu Kaixian Was Elected President</p>
<p>Tong Xingbai and Cai Hongtian Were Elected Secretaries</p>
<p>The staff of the Municipal Party Department, due to the need for exercise during their spare time, initiated the organization of a football team. Although they thought their skills were clumsy and they could not be called outstanding, they were ambitious and invincible, and used it to exercise their bodies and promote health, which is a good thing. Previously, He Yuanming and Feng Guangjia were appointed as preparatory members, and each committee member worked hard to assist, and the process was very smooth. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, a general meeting of members was held on the third floor of the department to formally establish the Qingbai Football Club, pass the articles of association, elect Wu Kaixian as president, Tong Xingbai and Cai Hongtian as secretaries, Lai Zhiwen and Wang Deyan as the captain and vice-captain of the football team, and Tong Mu, Ge Fang, and Wei Ren as managers. It is said that the team plans to start practicing immediately and meet on the battlefield, which will surely lead to a series of jokes.</p>
<h3>Preparation of the Shanghai Cycling Association</h3>
<p>Recently, Henry A. G. Keates, Parcy J. G. Bew, and William A. G. Waters, considering that cycling is used for exercise in Western countries and is a very popular sport, but it is rarely promoted in China, in order to encourage people from all walks of life to develop an interest in cycling, they initiated the Shanghai Cycling Association. The preparatory meeting was held at the Ann Lun Company at No. 39 Tongfu Road at 6:00 PM the other day. Tang Yijun was elected as president, Mr. Kcates as honorary secretary and treasurer, and it was decided that the association's office would be temporarily located in the Ann Lun Company. The membership fee is provisionally set at 3 yuan for this year until the end of the year, and 5 yuan per year from next year. All members will be able to enjoy free participation in the association's social events or competitions in the future. On that day, new members joined one after another, totaling more than 20 people, including two female members from the West. It is said that a formal inaugural meeting will be held soon, to be held in a public place. People from all walks of life who are interested in cycling, regardless of gender, age, or occupation, are welcome to join the association. Please contact Mr. Tang Guanyi at Ann Lun Company, No. 39 Tongfu Road.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>Wind</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>I have heard that complaints are close to being reactionary, and it is not appropriate to express them too much; wind and moon are a bit corrupt, and this matter must also be taken seriously. In the early years of the Western Jin Dynasty, the Eight Princes fought fiercely, causing turmoil in the world; Liu Yao and Shi Le shouted, and they entered Luoyang ten times. If you flip through the Book of Jin Dynasty, what kind of praise or criticism do you see from the historians? Alas! The imperial court was originally free from mistakes, and the troublemakers were Wang (Bi) and He (Yan). Wang and He advocated pure talk and liked to talk about wind and moon, so they were accused of "causing benevolence and righteousness to decline, scholars to be disgraced, rituals to collapse, and the Central Plains to fall apart." In the future, if the historians accuse the loss of Rehe and the crisis in Tianjin and Beijing, it is because the editors of Free Talk talk too much about wind and moon. To correct the law and extend the national law, what will you do? There is also a master of talking about wind and moon, Wang Yifu, everyone accuses the demise of the Western Jin Dynasty as his "verbal fault"; Shi Le caught him and stated his crimes; "This person is the one who disturbs the world!" In the future, if the king's army goes south and all people submit, the holy king will punish the two opinions, and the Free Talk reporters will have nowhere to escape their guilt to the world, so talking more about wind and moon, I am quite skeptical!</p>
<p>So, is it okay not to talk about "wind and moon" and only talk about "wind"? When I open the Book of Songs, oh my god, it's even worse! The Great Preface to the Book of Songs says; "Wind is wind... The superiors use wind to transform the inferiors, and the inferiors use wind to satirize the superiors, focusing on the text while indirectly admonishing, those who speak are not guilty, and those who hear are enough to be cautious, so it is called wind." We lowly people can only satirize the superiors with wind; I'm afraid that the superiors will be unhappy, and the words in my heart are spoken in a roundabout way, desperately working on focusing on the text and indirectly admonishing; as a result, those who speak are still guilty, and those who hear are not cautious. It also makes the orthodox thinkers greatly unhappy, saying that "satirizing the superiors with wind" and "focusing on the text and indirectly admonishing" are not open and aboveboard, and are so unacceptable that they itch to take a bite. So, I am cautious about talking about "wind" alone.</p>
<p>Moreover, the word "wind" has another meaning. The Oath of Fei; "Horses and cattle in the wind", Zuo Zhuan: "Horses and cattle do not meet in the wind", Fu Qian noted; "Females and males attract each other is called wind." Guangya and Shiming explain "wind, release." Han Shu Yiwen Zhi notes; "Release, dissolute." Saying "females and males attract each other", saying "release", saying "dissolute", all have the meaning of licentiousness and recklessness; When moral education is written in the orders, customs are cultivated, it will never tolerate excessive and unrestrained behavior; the reasons why "wind" cannot be discussed are like this.</p>
<p>Some say: "The southern wind is warm", "benevolent wind is widely spread", "good weather and good harvest", there are many auspicious words, why not praise the holiness of Yao and Shun, and praise the benevolence of Wen and Wu? Why satirize with wind? Cao Zi said: "Yes, yes, I will praise it:" The poem says:</p>
<p>"The north wind is roaring, the rain and snow are falling: Show kindness and love to me, hold hands and go home, how empty and evil, how urgent and just!</p>
<p>Nothing red is not a fox, nothing black is not a crow, show kindness and love to me, hold hands and go by car, how empty and evil, how urgent and just!"</p>
<p>(Poem: Northern Wind)</p>
<h3>Dismissal</h3>
<p>— Peng Xuezhen</p>
<p>This morning, Rongzi went out and returned with a sad face not long after.</p>
<p>Mother was mending clothes on the threshold, watching Rongzi enter the house, her heart skipped a beat, and she almost pricked her finger with the needle.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, can't you really weave anymore?"</p>
<p>"I told you long ago, the silkworm leaves that cost more than a dollar a load last year, the cocoons sold for thirty dollars a load, the sellers are heartbroken, and after deducting the cost of seeds and labor, there's not much left; but the silk factory is weaving silk and can't sell it, everyone loves to wear foreign goods."</p>
<p>"Did Uncle San's workshop close down?"</p>
<p>"Haven't quite a few closed down in recent years? It's all the mess caused by rayon."</p>
<p>Rongzi remembered Uncle San's bitter face:</p>
<p>"There's no more silk today, my workshop will stop working from now on."</p>
<p>"You're having an old episode again, I've heard you say it ten times?"</p>
<p>"This time it's true, I heard that some have lost all their money, the woven silk can't be sold, and Hongsheng Silk Factory won't take it. They say the Japanese are fighting us somewhere, it can't be transported out, and the people are poor."</p>
<p>"But wearing foreign goods doesn't make them poor! What, what are we going to eat? Yirongzi was really anxious, staring straight ahead.</p>
<p>"Ask you, I want to go back to my hometown, but the fields, even paying the rent isn't enough, how many people in our village had enough to eat last year?" The old man's voice was also low.</p>
<p>Rongzi also remembered the scene of five or six companions coming out of the workshop with their heads downcast: there was no longer the rattling noise, that dark little room, that low-lying mud and dilapidated large wooden machines, everything was as nostalgic as the winter sun, and even that musty smell was strangely endearing today.</p>
<p>But everyone left silently, leaving behind the wooden machines that Uncle San would probably chop up for firewood when it rained heavily. Second Auntie vaguely stroked her chest, looking at the door.</p>
<p>It seems that one day won't let us live, Xiuma, what will we eat tomorrow?</p>
<p>The woman opened the quilt and dug under the bed a little. A handful of copper coins, 490 of them, scattered on top, and big tears fell on them.</p>
<h3>Early Summer in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Perhaps</p>
<p>The spring breeze seems to have mischievously slipped away like a naughty child.</p>
<p>Light, joyful smiles fall from the lips of passersby, silently, imperceptibly, into the dust of the road. Sunlight shines on the backs of young men in flannel suits, tickling them as if women's fingernails were lightly scratching them.</p>
<p>At noon, the sidewalks seem a little deserted. The shop assistants, leaning against the glass counters, rub their sleepy eyes, glaring disapprovingly at the oblivious trams. The usually silent coffee shops, like widows preparing to remarry, are adorned with unusual beauty, and the signs outside the doors for soda, ice cream... are even more eye-catching than the red characters in a certain newspaper during the January 28th Incident. Behind the window curtains, in the clean seating area, pairs of young lovers sit, sucking shaved ice with straws, smiling. The boy hides in the corner, secretly laughing.</p>
<p>The passengers on the bus route have been particularly crowded recently, and the number of visitors to Zhaofeng Park has broken all previous records.</p>
<p>The poor ghosts living in the slums seem to have been saved, smiling as they take their winter clothes to the pawnshop.</p>
<p>The pot-bellied capitalists are beginning to worry, even furrowing their brows in their dreams.</p>
<p>The young mistresses, confined in their Western-style houses, idly tease their Pekingese dogs, wasting their endless days. Their souls fly out of their bodies, searching for their…… beneath the white clouds.</p>
<p>The weather changes day by day, and everyone's mood changes day by day.</p>
<p>After eight o'clock, black-plated cars rush madly into the French Concession. Dignified English gentlemen, in the darkness of the carriages, steal kisses on the bare breasts of young girls. The drivers mutter and curse the drunken sailors who are embracing saltwater sisters and singing in the middle of the road.</p>
<p>On Avenue Joffre, young men and women are immersed in dreams of love and poetry. The white…, leaning against the lamppost, silently recalls the Gao… of his homeland before 1917.</p>
<p>Mount Lu? Mount Mogan? … The quarreling of the compradore and his concubine drifts down from the terrace.</p>
<p>"Am I like a bird in a cage?" The weary sigh of a traveler asking at the western pavilion.</p>
<p>The tram speeds past, the platform crowded with people, taking an economic joyride.</p>
<p>"Peace talks in Peiping and Tientsin have been concluded!" The newspaper boy at the tram stop cries out in a shrill voice.</p>
<p>However, like a stone thrown into surging waves, no one pays attention. The trembling breasts of women in thin gauze, bare feet, and lotus-like pink arms captivate the hearts of passersby.</p>
<p>The entire early summer Shanghai is intoxicated with a carnal atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Random Jottings from Qu Lu</h3>
<p>— Zi Zhan</p>
<p>(Thirty-Seven) I Can't Help But Write a Poem</p>
<p>When Cangjie created writing, the ghosts were said to have wept,</p>
<p>Is it not without reason that writing invites jealousy?</p>
<p>Scholars do not fear the crime of wild words,</p>
<p>Poets would rather not cease their feelings of anger and indignation.</p>
<p>Willing to talk about strange water creatures with a single spine,</p>
<p>Still willing to be imprisoned in the mountains for ten years.</p>
<p>Pitying the masses who go alone to the southern wilderness,</p>
<p>The sea of clouds is vast, and the path of the world is long.</p>
<p>Zhigang came from Peiping and is about to travel to western Guangdong. He passed through Shanghai and we were able to meet again for a few days. He showed me his recent book, "An Exploration of the Myths of Chinese Water Gods," and I read it to the end. Such an obscure subject, with such tedious research, can make the reader feel like they are reading a fluent essay or a vivid novel. It is truly an unprecedented work in the study of Chinese folklore, which will be validated by peers, and is not just my personal opinion. Zhigang is about to leave. Li Wu Juren said that I should write a poem, so I can't help but recite one first, to await the sounds of others. Moreover, with mutual understanding between China and Japan, the world will be at peace from now on, and it is also indispensable for we muddle-headed and senile poets to embellish such a prosperous age.</p>

<p>Selected Correspondence Between Carrot Top Whiskers and His Father</p>
<p>Carrot Top Whiskers' Letter to Di Bick (Sent from Saint Mark's Academy):</p>
<p>Dear Dad,</p>
<p>My fishing game during the holidays has made me sick. I feel like some big nails have grown out of my sides. I'm now sick in bed. I'm lying on my back, and the nurse is putting plasters on me. When the nails haven't broken through yet, I feel pain. After they break through, I don't feel it anymore. But these nails are breeding like chickens. After healing one, three new ones grow out. But I hope this problem will be gone soon.</p>
<p>Lei Xu Ke's Reply:</p>
<p>Dear Carrot Top Whiskers,</p>
<p>Since you are now preparing to celebrate your first Catholic initiation and studying mathematical catechism, you should know that humanity does not want you to bring nails to them. Jesus Christ had nails on his hands and feet. His nails were real, but he didn't complain.</p>
<p>Be brave! Your Father</p>

<p>Dear Dad, I have good news for you: I grew a tooth. Although it's not the age yet, I think it's a precocious tooth. I believe a second one will grow next. I will continue to work hard and abide by the rules to comfort you.</p>
<p>Lei Bick's Reply:</p>
<p>Dear Carrot Top Whiskers, Just as your tooth was growing, one of my teeth began to shake. It didn't fall out resolutely until yesterday. Therefore, although you have one more tooth, your father has one less. So the total number of teeth in our family remains the same, without any increase or decrease.</p>
<p>Carrot Top Whiskers' Letter to Lei Bick:</p>
<p>Dear Dad, I'll tell you something, see if you can imagine it: Yesterday was the birthday of our Latin teacher, Mr. Zhe Ke, and the whole class had already unanimously elected me to deliver a congratulatory speech. I was flattered and spent a lot of effort preparing the speech, and I appropriately quoted a few Latin sentences in it. To be immodest, I was very satisfied with this speech myself. I copied it clearly on a piece of parchment. Yesterday, encouraged by my classmates whispering, "Go, go quickly!" I ran in front of his podium while Mr. Zhe Ke wasn't paying attention. But as soon as I unfolded the congratulatory speech and read aloud:</p>
<p>Respected Mr.,</p>
<p>Zhe Ke stood up angrily and shouted:</p>
<p>"Get back to your seat!"</p>
<p>You can imagine how I ran back to my seat with a broken heart. While my classmates were hiding their faces behind their books, Mr. Zhe Ke angrily ordered me:</p>
<p>"Translate this passage of Latin for me."</p>
<p>Dear Dad, what are your thoughts on this matter?</p>
<p>Lei Bick's Reply to Carrot Top Whiskers:</p>
<p>Dear Carrot Top Whiskers, when you become a member of parliament, you will see many of the same things. Everyone has their own duties. Since people have placed your teacher on the podium, it is obvious that he is there to speak, not to listen to you speak. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Qian Li and Li Wa</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Heavily made up with a lot of powder, dressed娇娇滴滴娇娇滴滴, giving speeches to the public to resist Japan and save the country. The two words "Leng Qianli" are derived from Wu Gan, meaning to dress up and beautify. Women in Wu</p>
<p>The school said a few cold words, calling out: "Resisting Japan does not forget emotions, Qianli can also resist Japan."</p>
<p>Therefore, the ancient name of Suzhou was "Liwa Township." In this year of severe national crisis, the Liwa transformation of Suzhou women is "greater than, and not less than" in the past. The Liwa transformation of the red and plain daughters, the Liwa transformation of the red and plain daughters of the wealthy families, the Liwa transformation of the young women of the rich families, that's all; there are also the Liwa transformation of the Xiaojia Biyu, and the Liwa transformation of the small vendors. Even, relying on the omnipotence of Qianli, it seems that it can move the retrograde of the era; there are Liwa-style middle-aged women who forget that they are 20 years old, and Liwa-style white-bearded grandmothers who forget that they are 30 years old. Whether Liwa is beautiful or not, let's deal with it later; but, Liwa's only mission is nothing more than being a salesman for enemy goods. On the bodies of various Liwa who love Qianli, they must always sell some "Nine People" brand products.</p>
<p>Female Bodhisattvas, female Bodhisattvas, I put my hands together and offer a word: You love Qianli, then Qianli; you love to be Liwa, then be Liwa; this is your freedom, which is useless. But, you must know that studying your Qianli method from domestic products is true Qianli; creating your Liwa on domestic products is true Liwa. Female Bodhisattvas, female Bodhisattvas, believe in this statement, immeasurable merit.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Reading History</h3>
<p>— Long Sao</p>
<p>The collapse of the Ming Dynasty was purely due to the court being filled with mediocre and corrupt officials. Ma Shiying and Ruan Dacheng, taking advantage of the situation of partial peace, used the name of Prince Fu to act against the famous scholars of Fushe, such as Gu Gao, and finally monopolized power and became昏憒昏憒. Once the Qing army reached Nanjing, Ma was killed, and Ruan Dacheng sued for peace and attacked Xianxia Ridge and died. Ni Ruixuan, a woman from Suqian, scolded: "Selling the country still sells oneself, it's a pity to call a traitor a gentleman!" Extremely painful. Compared with Cao Cao's cunning and smoothness, and his broad spirit, he is really not on the same level. But in the world, there are still traitors like Ma and Ruan!</p>
<p>At that time, Grand Sima Yao Xuesen, seeing that the Ming Dynasty was about to end, wrote on a friend's "Monkey Holding Vine Sleeping on a Dead Tree Picture", there is a sentence: The monkey should wake up now, don't wait until the vine is dry and the tree falls 丨丨丨But the monkey didn't wake up after all, and after the tree fell, Ma and Ruan, who ruined the country, finally died. The mirror of selling the country is like this.</p>
<p>Historian Hendrik Vanloon, in The Story of Mankind, most succinctly describes the fall of Rome: Most of the people were gluttonous, lazy, and indulgent, and they didn't know at all about the country's impending destruction; the young people in the country, because they couldn't afford the heavy taxes, all joined the army to seek the interests of ambitious emperors, they lived in war from birth to death, the emperors of the second and third centuries all came from the army, relying on the strength of the brothers in the barracks, they drove out the previous emperor and replaced him; soon, they were also ousted from the palace by another warrior; thus the city became ruins, the people starved and plundered, and commerce also stopped, … the country was divided up by the nearby small nations! After reading this passage, we turned to examine our own country, the people not only don't know about politics, but also can't know, and are not allowed to know; young people drift around in the city with nothing to do, so they drop their pens, take up guns, and fill the tools of civil war; just looking at the situation in all aspects is no different from Rome in the twilight of 476!</p>
<h3>Remembering the Martyrs Cemetery of the May Thirtieth Movement</h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>Because the May Thirtieth period is approaching, and this May Thirtieth Cemetery is opposite my humble abode, so on a certain evening, I strolled over to pay my respects. Seeing the old wounds in the yellow earth; remembering the new scars on the edge of the Great Wall, it really makes people feel indescribable叹无方叹无方, and they don't know whether to laugh or cry.</p>
<p>Speaking of the May Thirtieth Cemetery, it is less than half a mile north of the Eight Character Bridge. During the January 28th Incident two years ago, the area around this tomb was the site of fierce battles between the two armies. Even today, there are still grass-covered trenches left; like honeycomb-like bullet marks. The cemetery covers an area of more than ten acres and is surrounded by low walls. At the entrance is a high altar where inscriptions are placed. In the center are four large characters "Those who come, do not forget," written by the late President of the Executive Yuan Tan Yankai. There is also an inscription next to it, written by Mr. Cai Yuanpei and written by Mr. Yan Shenyu. The article is nothing more than mourning the dead and encouraging them to come, so I will not repeat it!</p>
<p>After taking a few dozen steps further, there is the martyrs' tomb. That tomb is built very delicately. A flat platform more than ten feet high is built of cement, with stone steps in the middle for climbing. The platform is five or six feet long and six or seven feet wide, with stone benches on both sides for resting. In the center is the raised tomb. At the top of the tomb stands a…, crowing towards the east. Is it calling out to awaken the dreams of military force in the eastern neighborhood? Or is it calling us to wake up from our drunken lives? But I dare to say: Rooster! It's a waste of your good intentions!</p>
<p>Behind the stone steps, there is a hidden cave that leads directly to the place where the coffin is placed. However, it is dark and light inside, and you must hold an electric torch and candlelight to enter. Moreover, it is not very ventilated, and the moldy and humid air makes people want to vomit. Twelve coffins are arranged horizontally in the middle, which are the martyrs who sacrificed themselves on Nanjing Road!</p>
<p>Next to the tomb is a row of three-room bungalows, which are used for sacrifices. An old woman who guards the tomb is sitting at the door, and she is very happy to talk. She said to me: "During the January 28th Incident two years ago, because I didn't have the capital to escape, I hid in the tomb day and night. The tomb is surrounded by thick cement, as strong as a fortress, and bullets and small shells cannot move it in the slightest. As long as there is food and fuel inside, there is really nothing to worry about. Later, a team of soldiers used it as a temporary headquarters, eating, drinking, singing, and talking were very lively, so I cooked for them, and I really forgot that bullets were flying outside the tomb. Later, when our army retreated and the Japanese army came, they didn't make things difficult for me because I was old and alone; and they paid deep respect to the heroic souls in the tomb.</p>
<p>Heroic souls in the tomb! Are you sleeping soundly underground, with your eyes closed and your hearts dead? The ravages of Zhabei two years ago have already made you uneasy. Now looking back north, it makes you even more resentful! Cry! Cry! Green grass and white poplars are also weeping sadly; crows and frogs are also呜呜地哀呜呜呜呜呜呜呜地哀鸣!</p>
<h3>Preface to the Catalogue of Mr. Liu Haisu's European Tour Works Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Sun Ke</p>
<p>Chinese and Western painters both value transmission, and because they value transmission, there is a patriarchal system. Disciples do not necessarily fall behind their teachers. Understanding it is up to the individual. Therefore, one sect can be derived into several schools, and one school can be derived into several branches. There are sects in schools and branches in branches, almost like the Buddhist inheritance. If you want to stand out in the art world, but there is nothing to inherit from above, you must rely on which branch or school your work is close to. If you are not like this, you will not be able to convince people, and people will also criticize you as water without a source or a tree without roots. Mr. Liu Haisu is a genius, but he believes that this is living under someone else's roof. Even if you become famous, the name is not my name, even if you become a family, the family is not my family. Therefore, he cultivates his energy, concentrates his spirit, and silently operates it. He gathers his nature and restrains his emotions, and thinks deeply about it. He goes far to the East and West Oceans to watch it wantonly. Everything that the beasts walk, the birds fly, the fish swim, the grass and trees are beautiful, the clouds and clouds are steaming, the high cliffs and deep valleys, the ancient garrisons and cold cities, everything in the universe that is playable, entertaining, surprising, appalling, singable, and weeping, is stored in the chest. After storing it for a long time, there is a sudden understanding in the heart, and then it is generously released from the hand. With or without measure, it merges with things, without knowing there is a sect, let alone a branch. Therefore, he called himself an art rebel. Those who hear the name may doubt that he is not ancient, not modern, not Chinese, not Western, and that he cannot achieve anything. They don't know that you want to be neither ancient nor modern, neither Chinese nor Western, but to become yourself. Western poet saint Byron said, man is great, but nature is greater. Your becoming yourself is to make yourself one with nature. Its greatness is beyond humanity. Mencius said: Those who wait for King Wen to rise up are ordinary people. Those who are limited by patriarchal branches, how can they talk about this? I heard that there is also a sudden enlightenment method in Buddhism. Are you an enlightened person? I would like to tell this to those who read your paintings.</p>

<h3>The Northeastern Fourth Company Commander</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Episode 8: Angry words inspire the youth to resign from office and escape.</p>
<p>Enthusiastically pitying the girl, he comes to hug her.</p>
<p>Gui Zhi shook her head, shaking the two long earrings on her ears, and hit her face a few times, pouting and smiling: I don't know! After saying these four words, he walked into the inner room. Mr. Jiang and Company Commander Guan sat across a table, pushing the teacup again and smiling: It's really slow to come to our house. There's nothing to eat or drink. Guan Yaowu said: I ate and drank in the backyard, and I don't need it now. I came here specifically to pay a New Year's visit. Mr. Jiang was tapping copper coins from his clothes while saying: If you don't eat or drink, you should smoke two cigarettes. Guan Yaowu shook his hand repeatedly and said: I don't want to smoke cigarettes either. I'll wait for the day when our cousin gets married, and I'll come back to drink a glass of happy wine with you. Mr. Jiang smiled and said: You always mention this sentence. Do you really want to be a matchmaker for your cousin? Or are you just joking? Guan Yaowu said: Really! How could it be just a joke? Gui Zhi was sitting alone on the pit in the room, peeling his fingers with both hands, listening to what was being said outside. Now that he heard Guan Yaowu say that he was really acting as a matchmaker, he couldn't help but feel his heart jump twice. So he sat a little closer to the wall, tilted his ears, and listened to the next door. At this time, Guan Yaowu's voice suddenly became quieter, whispering, and he didn't know what he was talking about. Because his voice was low, his own mother's voice was also low. It seemed that Mr. Jiang said something like, what else are we unwilling to do? When Gui Zhi heard these words, his heart was beating even more. However, he didn't figure out what he was saying, and he didn't know if he was talking about himself. In this ambiguous situation, he couldn't object even if he wanted to. If his mother didn't admit it, he would be said to be thinking too much. As a girl, thinking too much about marriage is indecent. Therefore, when he wanted to listen but couldn't openly listen, he lay horizontally on the pit, turned his face, and fell asleep quietly. In fact, he was also listening to the people outside the house. (86)</p>
<p>Small Recipe</p>
<h3>Early Summer Fish</h3>
<p>— Zhu Qingyi</p>
<p>"Fish is what I want." Mr. Feng, who was a boarder under Lord Mengchang's door, couldn't help complaining because he watched the whole fresh fish being sent to other people's tables, and he couldn't even taste a drop of fish soup. Leaning on the pillar, he flicked his sword and shouted: "Should I return with my long sword? I have no fish to eat!" Yes, fish is indeed delicious; the perch of Songjiang and the carp of the Yellow River are really famous fish known throughout the country, and the vinegar fish of Hangzhou is an even more famous delicacy on the shore of West Lake. In this early summer season, it is the time when brocade scales are on the market. What is recorded below are all seasonal fish in the Jiangnan cookbook.</p>
<p>Soft-shelled turtle Soft-shelled turtle is the common name for 鳖. When peonies are blooming, it is the most popular time for soft-shelled turtles. Its taste is fresh, rich, and delicious, just right, and is called "Peony Soft-Shelled Turtle." After this time, it will be too old to eat and become "Old and yellowed pearls are worthless." Although soft-shelled turtles are called fish, they are reptiles with shells and feet. Its skirt is not only rich and delicious, but also a Yin-nourishing tonic. When cooking, you must first peel off its black skin in boiling water. There are two ways to eat it. Boiling it with ham is fresh and delicious, but braising it with fresh meat is even more greasy and delicious. It is said that the red belly of soft-shelled turtles is transformed from snakes, and it is poisonous and inedible.</p>
<p>Yellow Croaker Yellow croaker, also known as summer fish, is cooked and eaten by every household in Suzhou on the day of Lichun to celebrate the season. The meat of yellow croaker is fresh and delicious, and there are very few fish bones, which makes it easier to eat. There are two sizes of yellow croaker, produced in the South China Sea in Zhejiang. When the spring river warms, the fish come in droves from the south, and at this time, the fishing boats go to catch them in groups. The simplest way to eat yellow croaker is to stew it with soy sauce and wine; it can also be braised. Braised, remove the fish bones, cook it into fish soup, and cook it with noodles, it is really delicious!</p>
<p>Hilsa Herring Hilsa herring is produced in the Yangtze River in Changshu and Zhenjiang, and there is also production in the head of the Fuchun River in Zhejiang. Hilsa herring is an indispensable seasonal delicacy in the Dragon Boat Festival gifts of Jiangnan families. Often the fish has changed its taste, but it is still carried around by servants. The way to eat hilsa herring is mostly to stew it with South Leg and lard. There is a lot of fat under its scales, so you don't remove the scales when you eat it, which is a special thing about eating fish. Hilsa herring is precious and fresh, so people who are particular about eating often go to the bottom of Jinshan to wait for the hilsa herring to come out of the water and cook it immediately. It is said that there is a kind of fragrance in the freshness, which ordinary hilsa herring cannot compare; because the hilsa herring dies as soon as it leaves the water, it must be cooked and eaten on the spot.</p>
<p>Cocktail fish Cocktail fish is also a fresh fish that is on the market in early summer. Its shape is like a small puffer fish, yellow with black spots; the white belly can swell very large, and it is smooth and delicate. When eating cocktail fish, you must tear off the fish skin. The lungs of the cocktail fish are very delicious. When it is first on the market, it is like broad beans, tender, fat, and fresh, and melts in your mouth, which is indeed a special flavor. Mr. Yu Youren was greatly inspired by poetry when he ate cocktail lung soup at the Shijia Hotel in Mudu, and wrote a poem of praise on the wall; later, because Li Genyuan first changed "cocktail" to "魞", Mr. Yu was very dissatisfied, and he rewrote his poem on paper and sent it to Shijia, leaving a romantic story in Mudu to this day. 鮝鱼 The taste of 鮝鱼 is very salty, and it is the most appetizing dish in the meal. The way to eat it is to stew it, braise it, both are not bad; cooking it with flour is even more delicious. The fish bones on the head of the 鮝鱼 can be made into a flying crane, and it is as delicate as the crab and butterfly.</p>
<p>In addition to the above types, there are also "Exam Fish" and "Squid" in early summer. "Fishing in the water is fresh and edible," which is enough for gourmets to feast on. However, when I write here, I suddenly think of a story about fish; "The Song City gate caught fire, and the people rescued it. They fetched water from the pond to put out the fire. When the water dried up, all the fish in the pond died." When enemy planes are flying around Peiping and the northeast fan barrier is completely lost, we ordinary people will one day be the fish in the pond that will suffer. But looking around the country, young people are saving the country by dancing, businessmen are saving the country by prostitution, and 乂乂们乂乂 are saving the country by opium, and gambling to save the country, and are still swimming in the cauldron with burning firewood. Except for listening to being fish and meat on the table, and being slaughtered by others, what way out is there! It's really going to be the sentence "Am I a fish?"</p>

<h3>Finance: US House of Representatives Supports Bimetallism</h3>
<p>Gold Price Drops Another $12.80</p>
<p>On May 30th, the gold market fell because of rising silver prices abroad, appreciating exchange rates, and significant gains in stocks and US cotton. The market opened in the morning at $945.70. The foreign exchange market also opened strong, with recent quotes showing British exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence, and US exchange at 25.9375. The exchange market then tended to strengthen, causing gold prices to fall. The situation was very calm, and then the market began to rise again, due to declines in Bombay. The daily high was $47.20 and the low was $39, closing at $947. In the foreign exchange market, the British exchange closed from 1 shilling 3 pence to 1.25, and the US exchange closed from $25 to $75. The "烚赤" (a type of bullion) price was increased by $61, with Yongfeng selling 70 taels to Tongfengheng. June/July swap spreads were priced at a discount of $13.80, with Ruikang offering it to Yingfengheng at 18 "條" (a unit of account). Yesterday, overseas cables reported that the Bank of England would not move, and the Bank of America was closed. However, British-US exchange rates continued to rise. The future of abolishing the gold standard in the US looks promising, and people remain fearful. The market opened lower again. A Reuters report from Washington indicated that the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee today passed a directive for US representatives attending the World Economic Conference to support a bimetallic system based on a fixed gold-silver ratio. Despite the downward pressure, the market recovered due to HSBC maintaining its quotes. However, the foreign exchange market was able to stabilize, people were nervous, and prices edged down step by step. The central government intervened with a large number of near-term US dollar sales, but the downward pressure persisted. The "烚赤" price was increased by $60, and June/July swap spreads were around $13. The half-day market conditions are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>The market opened in the morning at $943.90, $3.10 lower than the previous close. "物品" (Goods) opened at $4.20. The foreign exchange market opened with both British and US rates slightly weaker than the previous close. Recent selling prices for British exchange were 1 shilling 3 pence (or 0.0625), and US exchange was $25.0625. Hengyu and Bingxing bought "條" (a unit of account), betting on the June US dollar at 1.25, rising from $3.20 to $5.50. Mitsui then sold the August US dollar at 5625. Zhifengyong, Yuanshengyong, and Dadecheng competed to sell. A Reuters report about the use of both gold and silver caused the price to drop to $2. Macgary bought the September US dollar at 8125. Hengyu and Yifengyong also entered the market, gradually rising. However, the situation was stable, hovering around $4. When HSBC posted its rates, both British and US rates remained unchanged, and people seemed more confident, improving to around $6. At this time, interbank trading was quite frequent, and the process was slightly tight. The June US dollar was at 0.0625, and Hengyu, Qianchangxiang, Wanxing, and Zhaofengchang bought at $7. After fluctuating, Yuanheng entered the market, pushing it up to $7.80. HSBC came out with the August US dollar at half a dollar. Shunli, Wanxing, and Fuchang sold to within $5. Zhengjin and HSBC both sold the September US dollar at 75. Wahbi also offered the July rate at 375. Richang, Fuchang, and Hongli all sold, and the price retreated to within $3. Macgary bought the September rate at 8125, but was still held back. After much delay, the situation changed. The foreign exchange and gold markets reversed, and bank appetites were not good, causing the gold market to decline. Daxingyong and Yuanshengyong both sold. The September US dollar at 875 was difficult to sell, breaking the $40 mark. Soon, there were no buyers at 9375. Richang, Zhifengyong, [blanks], Yuanchun, and others sold, retreating to $36.20. Shanghai bought the September US dollar at $25. Zhaofengchang and Daxingyong went up to over $8. Finally, the domestic market continued to weaken, with unfavorable rumors. The [blanks] June US dollar at 0.0625 was still difficult to sell. Shunli, Zhifengyong, and others sold off. Meifengyong also sold, falling to $33.10. HSBC once bought the September US dollar at 0.0625, and Daxingyong took the opportunity to increase its position. The noon closing was $934.20. After the market closed, Fuchang and Zhaofengchang continued to supply, making it difficult to find buyers, and it fell to around $30. "物品" (Goods) were trading at $2.50. The daily high was $947.80 and the low was $933.10, a difference of $14.70. The result was a decrease of $12.80 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The quoted price remained at $24.625 due to HSBC's unchanged US dollar rate, equivalent to a standard gold price of $974.625. Based on the closing price, this was approximately $40 above the quoted price, a premium of slightly less than $13 compared to the previous close. The recorded price for this month was $974.60 (settled according to the US dollar exchange rate), $946 for June, $934 for July, and a "补水" (water supplement) price of $966. The "蛤赤" (a type of bullion) price was increased by $60. There were no formal transactions, mainly because there were few outlets and little incoming supply, resulting in a stagnant market. Swap spreads for June/July were offered at a discount of 63 "條" (a unit of account) by Fuyu to Yuanchun, at $13, and 105 "條" to Hengtai, at $13.50. Ruikang and Hengtai also traded 112 "條" against each other. There are still 1,414 "條" remaining for this month (to be settled today), and 5,453 "條" for June.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was slow. Each firm had frequent ins and outs, mostly going long first and then shorting, as there was no afternoon market today and the situation was not good. Many small investors painfully closed their positions. In summary, Shunli, Hengxing, Zhifengyong, Yuanshengyong, Yuanchun, Dafengyong, Fuchang, Hongli, Dadecheng, and Richang were mostly on the selling side, while Hengyu, Bingxing, Ruikang, Wanxing, Zhaofengchang, Daxingyong, and Yifengyong were mostly on the buying side. Zhaofengchang and Yifengyong went long first and then shorted. Daxingyong and Fuyu shorted first and then went long. The Ningbo traders had quite frequent ins and outs, with little overall difference. Shunli was slightly short, while Wanxing was slightly long. The Guangdong traders, Hengxing, did not sell much. There were a total of 22,953 July "條" (a unit of account). The total number of transactions the previous day was 38,549 "條" in the morning session and only 11,704 "條" in the afternoon session.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange: Excessively Weak</h3>
<p>[Blanks] Rumor: The Central Bank Sells Large Amounts of Recent US Dollar [Blanks]</p>
<p>According to yesterday's foreign cables, London's major rates, both near and far term, remained unchanged. New York silver prices were closed. British exchange against the US continued to rise by 875. The foreign exchange market opened with a slight weakening trend. Recent selling prices were 1 shilling 3 pence (or 0.0625) for British exchange and $25.0625 for US exchange. The market tightened briefly after opening, after HSBC announced its rates, showing no gains or losses for either British or US exchange. Afterwards, the gold market sought to sell, and bank appetite seemed sluggish. It was rumored that the central bank had sold a considerable amount of recent dollars, gradually turning the market firmer. There was a lot of interbank trading, and the process was extremely tight, with gains or losses of around 3125 (US dollars). Trading in shillings was scarce. By the noon close, the recent selling price was 1 shilling 3 pence 0625 for British exchange, and $25.3125 for US exchange, which was firmer by 0625 for British exchange and weaker by 3125 for US exchange compared to the previous close. In the banking sector, Citibank, Chase, Shanghai, and Andar all went long, while Mitsui and HSBC sold. The gold market also sold. There was a rumor that the central bank had sold a large amount of recent US dollars. The half-day bank transactions are recorded as follows.</p>
<p>The recent selling price for British exchange at the morning opening was 1 shilling 3 pence (or zero) 625. Transactions were scarce, with only Citibank selling the June rate at 3 pence 0625 to HSBC. By the close, the selling price had risen from 0625 to 1875. The buying price was increased by 0625.</p>
<p>The recent selling price for US exchange at the morning opening was $25.0625. Yue Li bought the June rate at 125. Mitsui sold the August rate at 625 to Andar. Mitsui also sold the same month's rate at 5625. Macgary bought the September rate at 8125. HSBC sold the August rate at 625 to Chase. Macgary offered Zhengjin, and Wahbi offered Chase, the June rate at 0625. Citibank went long on the August rate at 5625. HSBC sold the same month's rate at half a dollar. HSBC sold the July rate at 3125 to Shanghai. Zhengjin sold the September rate at 75 to Dutch Bank. Macgary bought the September rate at 8125. Wahbi sold the July rate at 375.

The buying price ranged from $25.4375 to $26.125.</p>
<h3>Major Rates Rebound by 125</h3>
<p>National News Agency, May 31, London Cable: Major rates rebounded again, closing at 19 pence 0625 for the near term and 19 pence 125 for the far term, each up 125 from the previous day. The British-US exchange rate opened at $4.02.</p>
<h3>Interbank Lending Rates Are Expensive, Month-End Settlements Are Extensive</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the month-end settlement period, and the complexity of settlements in the banking industry was naturally unmatched at any other time. However, due to the recent poor business conditions, the situation was relatively calm, unlike the prosperous conditions of last year. The interbank lending rate in the market was extremely loose, with both morning and afternoon sessions opening with unsecured lending, and "汇头头衬" (discounted drafts) were abundant, almost unprecedented. However, the lack of "劃頭頭襯" (demand drafts) was the opposite. As a result, "加水" (premium interest) remained consistently high, still at 3%, and was impossible to find.

Therefore, the total monthly interbank lending rate was only $1.47. Calculated over 30 days, it was only slightly less than 4.9 points per day. Given the fixed deposit interest rate of $2, it is expected that the upcoming daily meeting will discuss the deposit interest rate, and it will likely remain at the fixed rate of $2.95 after deduction.</p>
<h3>Securities: Internal and External Troubles</h3>
<p>The Bond Market Enters Another Period of Chaos</p>
<p>Trading Also Decreases Significantly</p>
<p>Disaster Relief Bonds To Be Auctioned Today</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange's bond market showed signs of disorder. Due to increasing rumors in the market the previous day, various groups rushed to sell, resulting in a drop of $1. The peace talks seemed to be progressing smoothly yesterday, and in the morning session, various groups slightly increased their purchases, and the Northern group also made some replenishing purchases, causing the market price to suddenly rise by $0.20-$0.65. In the second session, prices fell back $0.30-$0.40 due to some large investors releasing funds. In the afternoon session, sentiment remained weak, and the Northern group and number 50 both sold, causing a further drop of $0.30-$0.40. At the close, prices rebounded slightly by $0.30-$0.40 due to desk coverage, resulting in mixed gains and losses. Among them, the "編遣裁兵" (Disbandment and Troop Reduction) bonds fell by $0.15-$0.30, the "統稅" (Consolidated Tax) recent issues and the "鹽稅" (Salt Tax) distant issues, and the "整六" (Consolidated 6%) bonds all fell by $0.05-$0.10, while the rest rose by about $0.10-$0.30. The current bond market faces considerable changes in foreign affairs, and tax revenue is expected to increase after tariff autonomy. However, external troubles have not been resolved, and internal troubles cannot be avoided. Whether all parties can unite is still brewing. Therefore, due to nervousness, the bond market has entered another period of chaos, and trading has also decreased. The total number of transactions yesterday was $8,375,000, including $5,000 in spot transactions. Futures trading in the consolidated salt tax accounted for $2,350,000, troop reduction bonds accounted for $1,540,000, the 1929 Customs bonds accounted for $1,400,000, the 2020 Customs bonds accounted for $1,270,000, and the rest ranged from $30,000-$40,000 to over $200,000. The exchange announced that the first issue of the 20th year disaster relief bonds, totaling $30 million, is approved to be traded in the market from today onward, according to customary spot and futures trading practices.</p>

<h3>After Cotton Yarn Settlement, Cotton Yarn Prices Soar</h3>
<p>The yarn market is strengthening and prices are soaring, driven by continued demand for spot yarn in the southern ports.

<p>Hankou 450 Inland 405 Shantou 40 Nanjing 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is quite tight, due to a lack of bottom goods, and there is still news of rising US cotton prices, causing confidence to increase. There are many buyers, so the upward trend is intensifying. However, the gold market is falling, and the future depends on the progress of foreign cotton. The amount of cotton delivered on the previous day was 13,200 dan, and the delivery price was $46.50. Most of it was coarse cotton.</p>
<p>(Zheng Standard Buying Sentiment is Strong, Up $0.70-$0.80)</p>

Egyptian cotton spot prices fell 2 points. The Bombay cotton market initially rose due to purchases by European exporters and Japanese traders, but then fell due to profit-taking by bulls.

<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>Combined Records of Both Silk Cocoon Markets</p>
<p>(Supply of High-Quality Yuyao Cocoons Increasingly Scarce)</p>
<p>New Yuyao cocoons have been on the market for over a week. This year's breeding varies, and cocoon production is still low. The quality of improved varieties is the best, and various firms are competing to purchase high-quality cocoons. The supply has become increasingly scarce in the past two days. The highest cocoon price is $40, and the lowest is $25.</p>
<p>(Xinchang Cocoon Market Nears End)</p>
<p>The cocoon shops have been open for almost ten days, and inspections are strict. The market is preparing to close due to recent poor quality deliveries. The average cocoon price for this session is expected to be around $30.</p>
<p>(Sheng County Cocoon Production Only 30-40%)</p>
<p>Not many people are breeding foreign varieties this year. There was a sudden change in weather during the major sleep, causing 40% to be abandoned. The overall cocoon harvest in the entire county is only 30-40%. The cocoon price for improved high-quality cocoons is $35-$40, and native varieties are $25-$26.</p>
<p>(Few Danyang Cocoon Shops Open)</p>
<p>Only about ten cocoon shops are open. The shops have been open for three days, and the market supply is not strong. The cocoon price for improved varieties is $32.30-$34.50, and native varieties are $24.50-$26.70.</p>
<p>(Yangzhong New Cocoon Harvest Is Difficult to Be Abundant)</p>
<p>Farmers in the riverside markets and villages of Yangzhong have suffered damage to their native silkworms bred by Changbang this year. The remaining silkworms are limited, and the number of improved varieties bred as replacements is also small. The cocoon harvest is unlikely to be abundant. New cocoons have already been on the market. It is estimated that the overall new cocoon harvest for this session will be only 40-50% of a normal year. The cocoon price is $25-$26, and improved high-quality cocoons are $30-$32.</p>
<p>(Chenri Silk Factory Actively Declares Shipments)</p>
<p>The Jiangzhe Chen Factory silk subsidy ended yesterday (May 31). Various manufacturers are actively selling their silk inventory and declaring shipments for export. On the day before yesterday (May 30), another 300+ pieces were shipped to Europe via the British mail ship Nai Di La.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales Slow and Difficult)</p>
<p>The end of the month has arrived, and both Chinese and foreign parties are busy settling forward silk contracts. Sales are sluggish. In the past two days, only Zhejiang and Shanghai silk merchants have purchased 22 boxes of Shuangxing, Sanxing, Peacock, Jinlu, and other brands of June silk, priced from $175.25 to $169.50 net.</p>
<p>(Foreign Exchange Weak, Silk Sales Firm and Active)</p>
<p>The foreign merchant silk market in the local market in the past two days was affected by the abolition of the gold standard in the United States, and Yokohama silk prices rose to $850. New York silk prices also tended to rise. Yesterday, French exchange also fell back by 7 French francs, and European and American merchants all calculated the exchange rate and bought in batches. In the past two days, a total of 180 bales of Shanghai white factory silk, 100 bales of Sichuan yellow factory silk, and 30 bales of Zu Huang silk were traded, and the prices were firm.</p>
<h3>Needle, Eyebrow, Pearl Tea Sales to France Become More Active</h3>
<p>Yesterday, tea firms such as Sui'an, Wenzhou, Tuzhuang, Jinlong, Yihe, Tongfu, and Yongxing in various areas were actively arranging transactions and sales became more active due to telegrams of demand from Morocco. However, the selling price was reduced by $10. Zhenmei green tea was quiet in the market, and the Tuncun spot price had fallen to $200, and it was difficult to avoid further falls. Qimen black tea had 1700+ boxes purchased by foreign firms such as Yihe, Jinlong, Tianyu, and Xingcheng the day before yesterday, and the market was desolate again yesterday. The trend of the tea market is still unchanged.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>Thin Rice Rises by $0.20</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of 20-30 号 (numbers) was active, and the retail and wholesale routes were both active. The source was also relatively scarce, and the market situation was revitalized. Shops on this street sequentially purchased goods, and there were more Su and Tong japonica arrivals, so the market price could only increase by a few points. The price of good Nangang rice rose more than $0.10, and there were more bulk sales, but the supply was insufficient, with only a few thousand bags. The mindset for Yantai and Tianjin routes was upward due to the sudden opening of Tianjin帮(gang), and the prices of Qingjiao, Songsi, Xilian, and Bo rice also rose sharply by $0.20. This is the first sign of improvement after the holiday. Duyangjian arrivals and sales were both balanced, and the situation was quite optimistic. The Yinbianyuan route was sluggish, and the market situation was depressed. Chang bang situation was stable without gains or losses.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from the various waterways of Hexia ( 河下) was over 20. Baigeng sales were weak, and the market situation was fatigue by a few points. There was a continuing source of Bo rice, and it was slow to remove it. 客帮 (Ke Gang) bought about 1,000 bags, and the market situation was close to small angle. Chang rice was stable and fixed, 秈 (Indica) rice was upright, Bai Yuan's was little, sales could be accepted, and the price also showed a tight trend.</p>
<h3>Wenzhou Group Purchases Foreign Guest Indica Rice</h3>
<p>Not Many Arrivals - Market Turns Attractive</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Fuzhou group's purchases were not strong, and the total market catered to less than 2,000 bags. However, there have been few arrivals of "客秈" (foreign guest indica) rice in recent days, but the arrivals are only a few scattered quantities. The floating foreign rice inventory has been exhausted. Although foreign merchants have inventory, they are unwilling to sell at a lower price, so the situation is tight. High-quality goods are not being sold. Yesterday, the Wenzhou group went to the market to search for purchases, and the market appeared even tighter. The Wenzhou group purchased 1,400 bags of Xiaojiao rice throughout the day. The Min group purchased 100 bags of Hunan machine oil at $8.30, 550 bags of rough oil at $7.50-$7.40, 400 bags of rough Jing at $6.78, and 700+ bags of Nanjing Che Indica at $7.75. Medium and low grades were sold at correspondingly lower prices, and the goods that were sold were not particularly high quality.</p>
<h3>New Rapeseed Futures Already Thrown Open</h3>
<p>Oilseed Cakes Highly Sought After</p>
<p>New rapeseed from various ports has already appeared this year, but it has not yet been shipped to Shanghai, due to the impact of the price not meeting expectations. Producers and 车坊 (car workshop) in the producing areas have successively started operations, but there has been no shipment to Shanghai yet. It is currently heard that 2,000 packages of the July futures were thrown open with the price at 5 Liang. Oilseed cakes are enjoying the soaring market prices, and the local market has an upright mentality. The market atmosphere is swaying straight upwards. The biscuit market is flatter than the oil market. Medium quality yellow soybeans have increased the fastest. It is temporarily difficult to predict whether the future will go up or down.</p>
<h3>Hardware　Water Cement Still Looks Bullish</h3>
<p>Since the price increase of water cement, buyers are still very enthusiastic. Due to various environmental factors, manufacturers are still looking at a bullish market. Yesterday, the estimated price for the "Horse" brand was $7.30, and the "Elephant" brand was $7.35. For large transactions, there is still no spot stock. Because of this, construction workers are complaining because they cannot purchase any stock.</p>
<p>Galvanized Iron Sheets Practically Frozen</p>
<p>Judging from past years, galvanized iron sheet sales should be at their peak right now. However, due to the extremely tight monetary situation this year and the impact of the war in the north, sales have decreased significantly. Business for local construction workers and factories is also stagnant. Yesterday's market price for standard size 24 was only $14.70 per dan (unit), size 26 was $15.35, and size 28 was $17.00. Transactions were only sporadic.</p>

<p>Discussions</p>
<h3>The Attitude That Young People Should Have Now</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhi</p>
<p>Youth is both admirable and despicable; youth can have pure thoughts or base thoughts. Youth can go astray and do evil, and youth can be the most passionate in sacrificing themselves. In short, everything about youth exists between the adorable and the detestable, and the power of youth to shift the course of human society toward evolution or devolution is the greatest.</p>
<p>Most people think that the future happiness of humankind must be sought by young people, and the future peaceful paradise must be created by young people. Young people are pure and have conscience. In this view, young people are full of hope, and their responsibilities are of utmost importance. Young people will undoubtedly speak with honesty and purity and do things with integrity and justice. However, the current state of society is truly diverse and full of strange things. Although old bad habits and evil forces are flashing back with a dying glow and brandishing their claws, most ambitious young people may not pay attention to them. However, "false words and eloquence, non-compliant actions and eccentricity," the happiness and liberalism, are indeed the greatest enemies of young people. They are also the tempters of young people, exploiting the weaknesses of youth's indulgence and desire for quick success and instant benefits, using money and beauty to dazzle them. Moreover, the "greedy and insatiable" Japanese also exploit young people's weakness of wanting to get promoted and get rich, to bewitch them into becoming traitors, making them listen with fascination, and wholeheartedly offering themselves up for exploitation. Even if they die, they will have no regrets, as long as they can cause chaos and carry out Japanese policies, they can get promoted and get rich. If young people step onto this path of delusion, who wouldn't be overjoyed, thinking that they are enjoying all the blessings of the world and becoming the king of power in the human world? However, we, the young people who pride ourselves on having a conscience, who claim to have pure and clean thoughts, do we all agree that this is right? Is this considered a social revolution? If we acknowledge it, then we are already running down the path of evil, leading the country towards national ruin and the society towards regression!</p>
<p>The aspirations that we young people should have should be great and universal, hoping that everyone will engage in productive work, so that all humankind can live in freedom, equality, and happiness. All people in the world should develop their innate abilities, and all people in the world should have permanent mutual assistance and universal love, creating a world of ultimate bliss. This is the great path that we young people should take. All current forms of plunder and power are regressive and inhumane. Therefore, as a current youth, I must maintain an attitude of careful study and research. Climbing a mountain requires walking step by step, while jumping into the water requires only one leap. Therefore, we must not only be willing to sacrifice for the truth, but also have a firm and patient attitude that is not confused by short-term gains and small benefits.</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Fundraising</h3>
<p>— Qi Ling</p>
<p>For the sake of aviation to save the country through donations, the Boy Scouts of various schools have set off to serve. And so, I am also one of the members of a certain school.</p>
<p>On a breezy and clear morning, our team of six, carrying flags, donation boxes, and receipt books, set off with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>"Sir! Please donate as you wish."</p>
<p>The first person we encountered was a middle-aged merchant, and we stopped him.</p>
<p>"Okay!" Then a silver dollar was dropped into our donation box. He seemed very generous.</p>
<p>We walked into the back door of a certain house.</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Who are you looking for?" An old woman with gray hair showed a panic expression on her face when she saw us uninvited guests.</p>
<p>"We are students, because our China wants to buy airplanes to fight the Japanese, so we are out fundraising. Old lady! Would you be willing to donate something here?" I quickly explained to her.</p>
<p>"What? Are you fundraising again? Wasn't there fundraising when the revolutionary army was fighting before? No, no."</p>
<p>"Donate as much as you want, whatever you can." Old Wu said.</p>
<p>"Alright, alright, take these four copper coins, what a bother."</p>
<p>The old woman dropped four copper coins into my hand. "Four copper coins!" I thought. But it was not good to refuse.</p>
<p>Literature and Art</p>
<h3>Sentiments</h3>
<p>— Jin Zhi</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper for consecutive days fills me with tears,</p>
<p>Every page proclaims the sound of national crisis.</p>
<p>The Communist bandits spread and invade Jiangxi Province,</p>
<p>The Japanese bandits rage and press on Beijing.</p>
<p>The disaster victims' blood and sweat are exhausted in the entire region,</p>
<p>The bones of brave warriors lie scattered across the fields.</p>
<p>Looking back at those officials whose pockets are privately full,</p>
<p>They are too heartless to contribute even a hair.</p>
<p>News of war losses makes my dreams fearful,</p>
<p>I hate that I don't have a swift sword to cut down the long whale.</p>
<p>Indecision loses us thousands of miles of land,</p>
<p>Aggressors swallow up four provinces.</p>
<p>Relying on the League of Nations, they are all afraid to die,</p>
<p>Requesting the government, they also steal life.</p>
<p>Why not unite with all our comrades,</p>
<p>And strive to support the front in Beiping.</p>
<p>"Good young people, instead of staying in school and studying peacefully, they insist on running around, fundraising for what?" We still heard the old woman mumbling indistinctly as we left the gate.</p>
<p>We then encountered a young man dressed in fancy clothes.</p>
<p>"Please donate, sir!"</p>
<p>"What will you use the donations for?" he said with a smile.</p>
<p>"Sir, don't you know? This time we are raising money for the aviation to save the country fund. Haven't you seen the news in the newspapers?" I said with a tone of contempt.</p>
<p>"You also want me to donate something, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, as much as you want." Old Wang replied.</p>
<p>"Oh! I have money, but I won't donate. Are you going to scold me for being a cold-blooded animal?"</p>
<p>"..." We thought this person was mentally ill.</p>
<p>"You bunch of..." He said indifferently: "Aviation to save the country fund, let me ask you, will the money you donate be used to buy airplanes? Will you be able to fly the airplanes yourselves? Old [I] say, before you set out to fundraise, Shanghai</p>
