<h3 id="c26">日本調整外交關係（健） <a href="#c26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>
<p>日本廣田外交。新近特高標調整對華對美對蘇之外交關係。一方面大倡其所謂親善論。他方面則改組其外務部内之部務同時更迭駐外大使。務使與對手國間外交關係。暫趨圓滿。使以前之種種隔閡。得因日本外交之刷新。而轉換目前殭化之局。以脫去其孤立之境遇也。其實日本外交之所以形成今日孤立之局者。並非太平洋沿岸各國對日有何挑撥。乃由日本軍國主義者肆意蜜幹故也。日旣已發動九一八瀋陽事變。占據我東北三省。復又進據熟河窺伺華北。我國民縱無力與之拚持。亦安能俯首忍辱而與之言親善。故此種敵對關係。須有事實上之變革。而非徒恃空言與巧妙之手段所能轉換也。美國與日本之經濟競爭。亦由於遠東市塲之爭奪。日欲獨占太平洋海上之霸權。故到處表現衝突之實在性。至於蘇聯對日之戒備。亦由於日本急急進行其併呑中東路之政策。由是可知其更換大使刷新外交等等表面工作之爲徒勞。而不能減緩其當前對立之根性。</p>
<p>且也。日本外務之改組。於歐亞外交。於對美關係。均一一重新估價。而其着重之點。實不在乎革新日本對美之外交關係。而在乎奬勵保護日本對南北美洲之移民。欲借以解决其隱而未顧之經濟恐慌也。日本所感受世界經濟恐慌之激盪。自彼盛倡其非常時期而後。軍需工業之剌戟。雖可掩過一般之弱點。但現在世界形勢。旣不許日本一再挑戰。日軍閥亦不敢再盲目冒險。向世界宣明戰意。即對蘇聯亦止於奪取中東略實際權力。而不爆發眞實之戰爭。是以新設之調查部。在注意調查亞細亞洲各國之關係同時復加意調查南北美洲。則其用意固甚明顧也。</p>
<p>日本自侵略東北三省得手以後。進占熱河之易。竟出日閥意外。則今日何以不再繼續其硬幹政策歟。蓋至現在。彼亦自知國際關係太惡。勢不能再以防赤先鋒自居而取得列國之同情。故軍事行動。不能不暫時停頓。矧美蘇兩國旣已復交。而歐洲諸國。又多與蘇聯成立不侵犯條約。日本欲再運用以往之外交手腕。取得實際利益。恐不可能。更有進者。日英間亦以遠東市場之爭奪。與夫印度南洋諸島貿易競賽。惹起空前未有之糾紛。雖日印會議。或有求得暫時恊定之可能。然而英日兩國間不恊調之事實。已洞若觀火。矣則日本此時之所謂道理外交。所謂日美親善所謂中日問題之解决等等。皆不過爲一種外交上之烟幕而已。</p>
<p>吾人試就近來事實證之。第一日本新近借剿匪爲名。與傀儡國合兵進襲察東。其用意所在。固不僅止於圖謀察東。而爲侵略内蒙之先聲。特以窺探我國之心理。與各國之態度。以便再作第二步之行動也。第二日本軍閥近兩年來軍事冒險之結果。洞悉日美戰爭一時不至實現。英日衝突尙未到若何緊張。日本可操發動遠東戰爭之關鍵而單爭之可能性最大者。莫如蘇聯。日本欲保持其旣得勝利。祇有先行扼住中東路。以限制其在遠東方面之活動。故對他國佯爲表示好意。以緩和其敵對行爲。彼乃可增兵北滿。實行獨占滿洲一切利益。然則日本之所謂刷新外交。特借外交之名以粉飾和平。爲進一步之戰爭凖備耳。</p>

<p>來滬邀商界參加</p>
<p>國人當作何感想</p>
<p>東北被奪、瞬經三載、國聯宣布不承認僞國文告、亦已徧達全世界、乃僞國反自詡其成績、組織所謂觀光團、來滬、誘致滬上中外各行商、加入該團、國人痛心亡省、當然無心加入、即各友邦行商、怵於國聯正義、當亦不願加入也、茲誌其消息如次、</p>
<p>組織滿洲視察團　僞滿當局因九一八至今、已三年餘、與關内斷絶商業經濟、現在自謂秩序恢復、義軍肅清、遂由日本旅行社名義、發起組織「滿洲」視察團、此爲九一八後之第一次、其集合團員、在長春·瀋陽·而經大連灣·來滬、其目的之主重者、厥在請求上海方面各商行號加入、至滿洲考察日期在國歷新年、乘各界休息機會、請赴東北視察、</p>
<p>邀請滬商界加入　此事在半個月前、「滿洲國」即有消息到滬、請求駐滬日本總領事協助、希望上海各洋商行號、均派出代表一二人、加入此視察團内、同赴東北、觀察僞國三年來治理成績、故過去一旬以前、滬日本旅行社、即請各商行派員加入、並將辦法示告、而駐滬日領署、亦贊該社代爲邀請、</p>
<p>旅費等項均免除　聞「滿洲國」對今次第一回考察團到東北、一切特别優待、自上海動身、由水道到大連、從大連灣轉火車至瀋陽、所有各團員水陸旅行應用旅費、統予免除、概歸「滿洲國」担負、蓋其目的、重在使滬上各國商行有代表至東北、以爲「滿洲國」商務經濟發展之起點也、</p>
<p>滬商加入者無多　上海各商行、對於視察團、雖爲「滿洲國」組織後第一次舉行、但本年各業均不景氣、殊無意往東北考察、對於要求加入該團、即使不費川貨、亦多婉言拒却、而同意加入該團者僅少數某國在滬各行號代表、華人參加者、更屬絶無僅有、</p>
<p>滿洲團即將來滬　從滿洲出發來滬視察之觀光團、昨日滬上得訊、已離瀋陽即赴大連灣轉海道到上海、約星期日可以抵此、團員中日人居多、東北人居少數、該團本擬在滬加入大批上海團員同赴滿洲、聞在滬留停日期甚促、仍須由海道往大連轉至東北、</p>

<p>蔣廷黻不推薦及格學生出洋</p>
<p>朱延豐向校長評議會說理由</p>
<p>（北平特訊）清華大學研究院第一届畢業生經敎授會審核成績及格、准予畢業者、已依照研究院章程第十四條之規定、推薦於評議會、准予派送出國者計陸學善邵循正邵循恪三名、該校研究院本届畢業生朱延豐、因此次派送留學生、敎部命令派遣五名、而適合研究院章程第十四條者僅四人、朱延豐亦在内、照章應同時派送出國、曾兩次上呈評議會及校長梅貽琦、現得評議會答覆、因主任導師蔣廷黻未予通過、仍不照准、全校師生對此、空氣緊張、記者特赴清華大學訪問、茲分誌各方情形如次、</p>
<p>派遣留學内幕　清華大學此次派遣國外研究生、係根據該校研究院章程第十四條之規定卽「凡研究院畢業生三年學分成績至一·○五、畢業考試及論文成績均在上等以上者、得由各系主任推薦於評議會、」今年研究院畢業生六人、而適合此三項標準者僅四人、敎部命令該校派遣者則有五名之多、事前校内一股輿論、均以將派遣國外研究者、非五名卽四名、絶無三名之理、歷史研究所畢業生爲朱延豐邵循正二人、成績均合規定推薦標準、照章均應由系主任推薦於評議會、乃該系主任蔣廷黻未將朱延豐推薦、及朱向蔣質問、蔣云、章程上「得由」亦可「不由」彼推薦、朱爲維護法律及保障學生權益計、不得已將章程解釋聲訴於評議會、評議會批復云、「關於研究院畢業生成績、均在上等以上者、推薦於評議會一節、業經上週評議會討論、僉認手續應逕系主任之審核、非成績在上等以上者、均必推薦於評議會、」因此、仍無結果、</p>
<p>朱延豐申訴狀　爲申請事、頃悉國外研究生已由各系推薦於評議會、但生並未被歷史系主任提出、不勝驚異、查生之成績、足够推薦標凖、而竟未被推薦、不知據何理由、生曾函詢蔣廷黻主任、請予補救、據蔣主任之表示、此系法律之解釋問題、研究院章程旣云「得由」系主任推薦、卽可不由系主任推薦、故主任有决定之權、但如校長或評議會認爲另有解繹、須補行推薦時、卽可照辯、據多數同學之意見「得由系主任推薦」一語、應作如下之解釋、「得由」之反面、爲「不得由」而非「不由」、「不由」係「由」之反面、「得由」係承上文而云、蓋謂如成績够上標凖時、始「得由」主任推薦、否則「不得由」故「得由」「不得由」係依學生之成績爲轉移、而非從一二人之專斷、換言之、卽應憑客觀的臆斷究從道也、故「得由」存字面上雖不能謂等於「應由」、然實含有「應由」之精神、蓋成績如達到「得由」之法律標凖時、則主任卽無法律的理由、認爲可以「不由」彼推薦也、深望校長、鈞會主持正義、糾正歷史系主任之誤解、俾得重於補薦不勝盼禱之至、專此謹呈評議會梅校長、學生朱延豐謹呈、</p>

<p>並發表節儉救國宣言</p>
<p>上海各大學敎育職員聯合會褚民誼·張壽鏞·翁之龍·鄭洪年·顏福慶·李登輝·胡樸安·康選宜·林衆可·雷國能·張季信·丘漢平·江鎭三·陳繼列·隴體要等四十餘人、發起組織之節儉救國會、經第十次執監聯席會議一致通過、茲錄其宣言如下、</p>
<p>節儉救國會之宣言　自九一八以還、東北淪陷、平津垂危、國人痛心、國難日亟、咸思有以挽救、然禦侮之舉、屢起屢獗、推原其故、蓋因平日無充分之準備（一旦事急、乃倉卒應敵、以血肉之軀、當銳利之器、成啟利鈍、固不待智者而後知也、敵人步步爲營、得隴望蜀、其不以今日所旣得者引爲滿足、殆爲世人所共喻、美之三年造艦計劃、俄之沿疆築壘屯軍、皆鑒於我國兩年之内、喪地數千里、而暴力侵凌、猶無底止、遂亦感受間接之威脅、而不能不積極籌備國防、自固其圍、近日美俄之間、成立恊定、互相携手、以準備應付最近將來太平洋上驚天動地之惡風雲、彼美俄者、素以强盛見稱於世、一旦感受間接脅威、尙且急起直追、若恐不及、然以反視積弱衰病直接當衝之我國、其國防之設備、則何如乎</p>
<p>籌備國防首重經濟　而經濟最後之來源、則在國民、故充實國民經濟、實爲今日救國之第一要務、至其方法、要亦不外開源與節流兩端、顧源之道、至爲艱鉅、遠大計劃、絶非一時之所能辦、惟節流一事、輕而易舉、凡我國民、苟具决心、隨時隨地、皆可實行收效、同人不敏、竊欲先從事於消極之節流、以漸進於積極之開源、此節儉救國會之所緣起也、其簡略辦法、卽在節省吾人非必需之用費、以充實一般國民經濟、使多數國民、不感受生活之壓迫、庶幾各有餘力、以從事於救國之途、惟是節流之道、至爲繁複、勢難逐一列舉、而同人所注意者、厥爲</p>
<p>最淺近最簡單數事　非謂卽此數事、已盡節儉之道、良以嚴格節儉、必非盡人之所能堪、茲先擇人人皆能遵守者數事、範以廣大信條、期其普及、果使行之有效其成績當亦可觀、至於能在本信條以外、更能刻苦撙節者、固爲同人所最韾香禱祝者也、抑更有進者、節儉之道、不僅在今日國難發生以後、應積極進行、而欲免除將來國難發生之根本原因、亦當力崇節儉、方今社會、奢靡成風、競尙浮華、公務人員所入之薪俸、動輒不敷其支出、於是貪贓枉法之事、日有所聞、廉潔之風掃地以盡、此而欲澄清仕途、烏可得乎、再就普通公民而論、亦因社會奢侈環境之引誘與束縛、生活日形窘迫、作奸犯科者、遂以日夥、社會日見墮落、迄無昭蘇之望、因政治之腐化與社會之凋敝、</p>
<p>其影響更及於農村　數千年來吾人依爲生命源泉之農村、今亦時有破產之虞、於是自通都大邑以至於邊鄙村落、無人不感受生活壓迫之苦、金融枯竭、購買力日以减削、舊有之工商業、猶岌岌無以圖存、新事業之發展、更無論矣、長此以往、卽無外侮、亦難自持、矧强鄰之日伺其側耶、準是以談、吾人對於節儉任務、不僅在應付當前之國難、且須振飭未來之惡習、以確立穩固之國基、其組織宜長久、其範圍宜廣大、所望邦人君子、不吝指示、踴躍參加、庶幾衆擎易舉、國家社會幸甚云、又該會簡章從略、</p>

<p>推進婦女敎育　推進農村婦女敎育案、（理由）據最近調查農村識字人數、占百分之一六·三、不識字人數占百分之八三·七、尤以女子爲多、故農村婦女敎育極關重要、統觀我邑已設立之民衆學校、女生數恒不及男生數、非有特殊設施殊不能推進、用擬辦法、敬請公决、（辦法）訓練農村婦女敎育師資、專設婦女學校、課程以日用爲主、如紡織裁縫編結醫藥識字記賬等、借村中民房爲敎室、備置應用工具、敎師能力不足、則請專材恊助、</p>
<p>確定敎育中心　確定二十三年份敎育中心案、（理由）國家敎育局苟無一定中心、則其國民之思想、自必散漫、而繁歸宿依國家社會現狀與我邑情形而論、開展民生富厚國力、甚屬急要、可否確定二十三年份敎育中心爲生產敎育之處、尙候公决、（辦法）由縣敎育局延集專家訂定實施方案、呈省備案切實進行、</p>
<p>指定領袖學校　指定三四五六區爲領袖學校案、（理由）本縣第一第二兩區中心制業已實施、其三四五六區因敎育經費和環境關係、尙未有中心學校之設置、爲謀一區敎育聯合和促進計、有指定領袖學校之必要、（辦法）由縣敎育局就三四五六區原有學校中、選擇一校爲領袖學校訂定辦法、遇事共策進行、</p>

<p>—全部秩序僅剩暨南對復旦—</p>
<p>江大足球賽中央及金陵兩校來滬比賽、已誌本報、昨日兩隊分别與交通及復旦比賽、客軍均遭慘敗、結果交通以四比一勝金陵、復旦以三比零勝中央、</p>
<p>交通勝金陵　下午二時半在交通大學舉行、交大全線整齊、鋒芒極盛金陵雖亦人馬强壯、但交綏之下、金陵關見不支、一刻鐘時、交大周光中首開紀錄、往後交大攻勢愈猛、時擾金陵腹地、周光中再中第二球、温聯東射入第三球、上半時就此結束、再戰聲中、薛文繡亦中一只、金陵於大負之下、力謀振作、入後形勢、尙欠平均、交大雖又有幾次機會、均失之交臂、金陵抵抗强悍、屢興問罪之師、卒於最後尙餘一分鐘時、由林堅學攻入一球、免遭全軍覆没、陣線如下、</p>

<p>復旦勝中央　復旦與中央之戰、在市中心區市政府球塲舉行、該塲地面平坦廣擴、草皮波厚、不下於棒球塲、交綏之下、形勢頗見緊張雙有互有機會、均未命中、復旦實力、原甚精悍、一時竟不能取勝、上半時各無建樹、休息過後、復旦振作精神、志在必勝、而中央驟覺招架不暇、門前敵踪密佈、復旦打家刦寨、勢極猖旺、卒被余順章先後連中兩球、中大雖層次欲圖反攻、但終覺前鋒力量薄弱、且限於關老爺之關防森　、無隙可乘、復旦於再接再厲中、安樂生亦中一球、以三比零擊敗中央、</p>

<p>下半時中華連中三元反敗爲勝</p>
<p>西聯隊雖爲明星缺欠合作屈服</p>
<p>拍賣皮球竟得五百元之鉅</p>
<p>昨日申園足球場開幕賽之中西慈善足球大戰之結果、中華隊以四比二壓倒西聯、觀者萬餘人、手舞足蹈歡欣雀躍、眼看西聯明星隊、爲中華健兒擊敗、中華隊在上半時完畢、以一比二落後、卒能奮發有發於下半時中、連下三城、反敗爲勝、遂奪得此麥令大銀杯、吳市長親自蒞臨、行開球禮、賽畢、由吳市長執行拍賣皮球、共充善舉、愚園路顧立仁君慷慨解囊、竟以五百元之鉅欵購去、開慈善足球賽之新紀錄、見義勇爲、殊堪欽偑、</p>
<p>戰情緊張精彩不多　雙方皆爲中西足球之精華、表演自屬上乘、惟中華隊以傷者傷有事者有事、萬象華仍以江大比賽之故不能出場、故中華陣綫、不能稱爲最滿意、而西聯臨時集合、合作甚難、故以精彩言、不甚多見、然戰情始終緊張、尙富興趣、中華隊在上半時中、落於人後、且時受攻擊、故已在驚險之中、下半時上塲二分鐘卽射中敵門後、再而成三比二、於是由驚險變而爲狂歡、西聯猛烈反攻、終成弩末、局勢復由激烈而趨於疲乏、最後五分鐘李義臣之再中、平淡之局面、又得興奮、造成最後之美滿結局、</p>
<h3 id="c203">中華隊隊長孫錦順手棒銀杯（啓昌攝） <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>西聯之敗出於意外　因中華陣線之不全、且西聯悉爲精兵、故事前之預測、咸爲中華躭憂、甚至有謂其結果將成四比零或六比二之鉅、豈知適得反、西聯之失敗、可作如下之分析、後衛失誤太多、中線右輔過弱、前鋒完全不能合作、許德與陶樂惠不注意兩翼、失足太多、如第五球卽許德之誤、史篤克不善作中線之外翼、昨功用太少、前鋒之中、兩翼行動遲緩、毫不能與華塞斯之兩名將茂林阿巧合作、於是合作陷於粉碎、華特不能跑、威利之送球、皆落線外、以個人表演論、史密斯鶴立鷄羣、守門赫勃脫救險亦殊不少也、</p>
<p>中華健兒滿意表演　回顧中華隊、得此成績、殊非容易、小心作戰、全力應付、爲得勝主因、表演亦出於意外、徐亨守門、日見進步、兩後衛小疵有之、不足爲病、中線徐亞輝仍然明星、陳鎭祥尙能應付、果甚努力、前鋒以右翼陳家球最稱出色、獨覇一方、孫錦順雖有鐵腿、射門無的、戴李射門、不减其色、顧尙勷以衛改翼、不能言其不盡職、稍嫌慢耳、</p>
<p>西聯氣燄先開紀錄　吳市長行開球禮後、中華開球、遠傳家球、西聯回攻、阿巧射門、旣救出、顧尙勷遂在左邊猛進、陶樂惠二次失足、皆無成就、中華隊之進攻機會仍多、一次家球傳中、麟經欲射未得、義臣截得、對門而射、竟飛木外、戴得家球之送、再射球門、赫勃脫接住而一滑、仍未得中、一料西聯之反攻、柯萊脫在右邊射門、徐亨撰住彈出、阿巧遂砰然進網、時已半句鐘、</p>
<p>拔回一城又告失守　旣失一球、中華進攻殊烈、圍住敵門、大施壓迫、家球得亞輝接濟、義臣接來攻門、許德回身送出、球去不遠、孫錦順再射、不中用之史篤克、竟於此時發生效力、球恰巧彈於史身、再彈門木而出、否則中矣、混戰之中陳鎭祥遠送一脚、遂又解圍、再五分鐘、孫錦順越位之後、李載臣傳顧尙勷、顧回送中、戴中鋒此刻乃一舉而中、一波方平、一波又起、華特在左邊龔進、球至右區、李江兩衛、因互相一呆、柯萊脫攻入不備、輕輕一撥、徐亨以爲出界、不知恰巧進門、上半時遂以此完結、</p>
<p>中華中興連發連中　下半時上塲、阿巧史密斯卽開始猛撲、圍解、中華健兒、又見活動、顧尙勷得球直進、許德來阻、一避而過、傳中送戴、再而與李義臣帶之、入無人之境、一衝進門、在此二分鐘内、頓時造成和局、中華由此中興、氣燄頓盛、兩翼極爲活動、西聯處境甚窘、五分鐘後、李義臣得孫錦順之傳、又中紅鵠、三比二成爲勝局、歡聲雷動、</p>
<p>日暮途窮戴又進　西聯由此注意後守、史密斯監視戴中鋒、寸步不離、雷米迫亦後退不出、改攻爲守、前鋒益陷於零落不堪用、途窮日暮、全告絶望、最後之五分鐘、家球攻門、李趕上頂球、與守門互撞、球被撰出、小戴隨後一送、成此四比二之結果、</p>
<p>拍賣皮球大洋五百　比賽完畢、吳市長與西人會會長格烈姆旭先後致詎、勗勉塲内健兒、感謝塲外來賓、致詞後、吳市長卽將碩大無朋之麥令盃、捧授與中華隊長孫錦順、在萬人歡呼之後、吳氏高托皮球、立於椅上、朗聲拍賣、方在數論價值時、地皮商人顧立仁君、卽挺身認購、其出價爲五百元、全塲無與之爭議、遂定、較舊年慈善大賽之球價、又超出三百元之鉅、可見海上人士、關心慈善事業之程度、誠與日俱進矣、</p>

<p>貞信杯乒乓賽舉行以來、已入决賽時期、南陽以其三戰三捷之餘威、今晚再戰泉星、雖擁有鄧·黃·王·顧·王·五虎將、但泉星之華以閎等、均係一時名將、故勝負尙難逆料、預料届時二隊相遇、必出全力以爭、以卜錦標之誰屬、</p>

<h3 id="c212">碰 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>紅頭阿三躱得三丈高，執掌着十字街頭的紅綠交通燈，於是乎電車不碰汽車，馬車不碰場車，人力車不碰自由車，雖然馬路如虎口，鄉下人背起了釘鞋雨傘，一樣地可以履險如夷，而避免了「碰」的危險。</p>
<p>「碰」是世界上最危險的一回事，因爲碰的結果，總是不忍說與不可說的。</p>
<p>軟的碰硬的，是螳臂擋車，不自量力。所以乖人不吃眼前虧，老遠地瞧見風馳電製的汽車，便站在人行道上等汽車過了再穿過馬路。眼見三道頭舉着棍子打人，還是及早拔腿奔避。玩筆桿兒的，對於玩槍桿兒的，得讓道而行，因爲筆桿兒是竹製的，槍桿兒是鐵製的，硬度大有分别。這些，都是「避磁南針」。</p>
<p>其實，「避碰南針」，不待提倡，早已家諭户曉的了。而且軟的對於硬的，卽使無可避免，或不及避免，而不得不一碰，至多也不過碰得軟的頭破血流，筋斷骨折而已，是對於大衆，不發生影響的，所以對於社會治安前途所極堪憂慮的，却是釘頭碰鐵頭，硬碰硬。</p>
<p>炸彈是硬的，泥土是軟的。炸彈掉在泥土襄，泥土顯出一個大窟窿，太平無事。但若硬的炸彈，掉在硬的水泥建築物上，不客氣，炸彈爆烈，建築物倒毁，人物牲畜，同歸於盡，這是硬碰硬的恐怖。</p>
<p>巡捕捉小販，硬的棍碰軟的肉，軟的肉對硬的棍避碰，一世不會閙亂子。巡捕捉强盜，大家都有硬的手槍彈，誰都不肯對誰避開硬的那一碰。這一碰之下，二敗俱傷，自然是意料中事，而無辜的行人，犧牲於這一碰之下，也並非是不可能的。所以我們希望盜匪絶迹，免得我們拐了二條腿在虎口般的馬路上走，旣要對車馬避着「碰」，還須留意着硬的流彈碰上來。</p>
<h3 id="c213">夢 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 傳朝陽</p>
<p>夢境是偉大的，不可思議的。在夢境裏，我們可以做五十萬頭奬的得主；我可以在夢境裏殺掉我們所憎恨的仇人。假使我們感到生活太平淡，夢就可以給我們一個曲折的奇異的境地。假如我們感到不滿意的事，夢就可以給我們一個十二萬分的滿足。夢是神聖的！</p>
<p>爲了夢有這樣的好處，所以没有一個人不想做夢。人人都盡他們所有的力是去做夢。他們可以犧牲了財力，人們的尊敬，自己的道德，甚至拉自己的生命去求夢的滿足。</p>
<p>然而，我們都知道夢是不會繼續到無窮遠的，夢總有一個時候會醒的。在夢中所得的滿足在醒後就會成爲電影，消失在一瞬間的。可是人們總那樣地追求着夢。</p>
<p>中國，是夢的世界。中國的人們没一個不在夢中生活着。他們想把自己成爲富翁；他們想把自己做爲要人；他們想把自己沉浸在幸福裏。他們忘了夢醒時的悲哀，他們只顧着夢中的一些極微細的快樂。</p>
<p>炸彈炸不醒中國人的迷夢；砲彈也轟不醒中國人的迷夢。似乎，只要有夢，中國人便會那樣滿足了的，其外的事可以一些都不必管。</p>
<p>然而！夢總是要醒轉來的！丢開夢中那一些些可憐的快樂吧！我們不要在敵人的槍口對準了我們的胸口之後才醒回來啊！</p>

<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑　剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>桂枝這才省悟過來，因笑道：我瞧見臉上黃瘦得這個樣子了，老是害病，我心裏就發急。實在這呌無理取鬧，發一陣子急，病就好了嗎？江氏笑道：哦！你自己也明白，那我也就不用說了。桂枝心裏忽然想着，我自己振作起精神來罷。於是自己舀了一盆熱水，將臉洗擦得乾凈了，在臉上抺了一層雪花膏之外，還把抽屜裏久藏未用的兩塊胭脂拿了出來，在兩腮上，塗着兩個紅暈。將頭髮梳得光光的，那掩着到臉邊的短髮，彎曲着扶到耳朶後去，用細小的頭髮夾子夾住。再對鏡子照時，容光煥發，就没有一些子病容了。自己爲了打扮齊整起見，索興把身上的藍布褂子脫了，更換一件洗灑乾凈了的。江氏在一邊看到，以爲他要出門去，便道：對了，你出去溜兩個灣回來也好，别悶出病來了。桂枝笑道：我那裏也不去，我怕人家見着我就没有病，所以擦一把臉。江氏道：你出去一也趟好，睡多了覺的人，應該出去透透空氣。桂枝也是覺得心裏慌悶，旣是母親如此說了，兩隻脚不由自己作主的，走上大門口來。可是他一到大門口，甘家的大門，正正的對了他，他立刻就是一征。本來是要向甘家門口這條路上走去的，於是就背過臉去，向另一方面走着。走了兩步路，自己不知不覺的歎了一口氣，搖了兩搖頭道：眞是寃孽，我這心裏怎麽老放他不下呢？他一步一步的向前走，眼睛看了脚底下的路，那裏有一叢草，那裏有一塊石頭，幾乎都辨白得出來。偶然一抬頭，只見一個穿半舊西裝的少年，將一頂闊檐毡帽，微微斜戴着。手上拿了一根細竹手杖，在身前兩邊搖幌着，一脚高一脚底的走着，也好像很無聊。桂枝身子突然的站定，咦了一聲，那人也猛然抬起頭來，彼此打個照面。原來他正是甘積之，要避開他偏偏遇着了他，瞎！這不是寃家路窄嗎？（二七七）</p>
<h3 id="c216">不倒翁 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 錢雪邨</p>
<p>不「倒翁，翁不倒；眠汝汝即起，推汝汝不倒。」</p>
<p>這幾句是我在小學時代讀到的；但是現在回想起來，倒有十二分深切的意義在。</p>
<p>講到不倒翁的本身，是一個蠟殻做成而專給人家玩弄的玩具。可是，你們倒不要因此而輕視它；它有和顏悅色的面孔，無論人家怎樣欺侮它，它總是不會發怒，還是笑態盈盈。它十足是個慈善家，又可說是大政治家。尤其，當人家眠它，那宋它就眠，不過眠後即起；人家推它，它就側向，可是它不倒。這樣，而它又是一個英雄好漢；它能屈能伸，有不屈不撓的大無畏精神，在古今中外的烈士和將軍，也只如此。</p>
<p>至於中國呢，有幾萬萬方哩的面積，那是要比不倒翁的蠟殻好得千萬倍。而中國對待人家，總是和顏悅色，任憑别國怎樣欺侮，它也總是和藹地，仍舊笑容可掬的對着人家。這樣看來，中國是一個大慈善的國家；而大政治國家可談不上。但是，當人家眠它，那麽它便長眠；人家推它，而它倒後不能爬起。如此，則中國是一個懦弱者，那裏有不倒翁般的能屈能伸和不屈不撓的大無畏精神呢？</p>
<p>唉！可以中國而不如不倒翁乎？</p>
<h3 id="c217">銅鈿銀子 <a href="#c217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>「銅鈿銀子，」，誰不歡喜？雖然，有種人口口聲聲說：「銅鈿銀子不可看得太重，」這話是不錯的。但是，說也奇怪，往往越是說「銅鈿銀子不可看得太重」的人，越是見了「銅鈿銀子，」眼烏珠越會張得大，突得出。這是甚麽緣故？有人說：這一句「銅鈿銀子不可看得太重」的話，原是對人而說的「風凉話！」如果，對自己也是這樣，眞的把「銅鈿銀子」，看得無足輕重。那麽，恐怕在這個勢利的世界裏，打起了燈籠，敲破了脚爐蓋，要找這麽一個傻瓜，有點兒難！</p>
<p>本來，芸芸衆生，所爲何事？說穿了，還不是爲的「銅鈿銀子！」没有「銅鈿銀子」的「窮人，」固然對於「銅鈿銀子，」不能放鬆一步，甚而至於夢寐以求之。你瞧，一年到頭，一天到晚，馬路上不能坐車子的，或走路的，熙來壤往，誰不爲「銅鈿銀子」而忙！</p>
<p>至於富有「銅鈿銀子」的「富人，」照理應該可以不逐逐於利了。然而不然，一樣還要忙，甚且更忙！一面十三檔算盤珠，滴裏答臘，一天撥到夜。一面腦經裹轉着『銅鈿銀子』多多愈善的念頭。像這種人，自然囉，「銅鈿銀子」，看得這般重，你如果請他拿點出來，做做慈善公益的事情，休想！因爲，他發誓也不會想到，一旦撒手歸天，「銅鈿銀子」任是怎樣寳貝，萬萬不會跟了一塊兒去的啊！就是說：遺留給兒孫們，結果，是徒供兒孫們擇霍作惡罷了！那又何苦呢</p>
<p>唉！但是，天是間擾擾攘攘，能彀看透了這一點的，有幾個人喲？</p>

<p>— 天恨生</p>
<p>十五年前，李阿泉的五歲女兒小玲，經媒人姜四爹說合，配給了俞明發的七歲兒子龍生；在姜俞兩家同意締烟之後，纔由明發請出左鄰開小米店的朱長春做帮媒，爲的是媒人必須成雙的緣故。</p>
<p>那時，李阿泉窮得很，就䞉了一條年齡已老，快要破裂的舊船，作爲謀生工具。一家三口，生活在那條舊船上，什麽都是因陋就簡，食，連盛飯的碗都有了缺角，買不起新的碗；宿，連褥子也没有，只有一條裏和面都補綴了無數的補釘，而棉花胎也有了不少的洞眼，挺硬得幾無暖氣的被單，三個人蓋着，在一片汪洋之夜，不等到冬天，那寒風夾着水的冷氣直入艙中，已經要索索地顫抖了。在阿泉的父母未死時，陸上本有三間租屋，船也不僅一條，阿泉的父親並不常親自操舟出門，只要把幾條船租給别人，收些租金，就夠一家開支，很有餘裕的了。不料父母先後逝世，又　了一把火，燒掉了三間祖屋，便不得不賣船；賣到只䞉最後一條舊船時，自己要靠它謀生，纔忍着没有賣，寗可受僓權人囉唣和自己不能温飽。於是阿泉就從此在水面上作生涯，給人家裝儎貨物，或東或西，没有一定。女兒小玲旣已許字了俞家，他就想過門童養。他以爲女兒終於是人家人，現在窮到這個樣子，何必也敎伊吃苦。而且他這條船，是要給人家裝儎貨物的，有一個小孩子，多少不便。他請姜四爹做媒的動機，也就是想做親後過門童養，以免女兒吃苦，也免了父母忱心，水上爲家到底不如陸上安全，小孩子容易遇到危險。可是烟緣締就後，他請姜四爹向俞家表示時，俞家竟不願童養；同時小玲的母親，也忽然捨不得這唯一的掌珠離開自己，而且對俞家拒絶童養有點憤憤然，冷擱了些時，有人租他的船，裝運幾百包麵粉，這問題便就此打銷了。</p>
<p>一年半後，阿泉的船纔回到故鄉來。上岸見過他的新親家俞明發，被新親家留着吃了一頓酒，談了些别後情形，倒還不差。阿泉雖不識字，人却是很爽氣，他告訴明發：所見王長興的一笨洋十元借欵，和其他幾處小債欵，都已經備好了償還了。他這回本來不必回鄉，爲的就是還清這幾笨債，和會一會親家翁，看看新女婿。的確，他是很歡喜這個女婿的，特地從遠處帶來了幾件玩具，見面時又給了銀塊錢；這一來，親家母也歡喜了。第二天，他又去會見了姜四爹朱長春這兩個媒人；帶錢到各處去還了債；連幾家親戚那裏都不及去拜望，第三天又開船走了。這一去，直過了二年多，方纔回來，光景也還和二年前差不多。</p>

<h3 id="c219">略談英雄 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 風子</p>
<p>自有歷史以來，中國是代代都有英雄的。而且也一定能夠改造時勢，故昔人曰：「英雄造時勢」。</p>
<p>這大概是眞的。天下大亂，必有妖孽，而蕩平妖孽的大功，則務須劃到英雄名下。所以李自成張獻忠之後，就得來一個清世祖·平流寇·伐有明·經略中原，於是百姓「簞食壼漿，以迎王師」。</p>
<p>「簞食壼漿」，所迎的照例是王師，而王師也還是一樣的殺人統率這王師的，不消說，是英雄。</p>
<p>英雄領著王師，浩浩蕩蕩，殺進關來，不但殺了一陣，而且還撒下種子，凖備世世代代殺下去。漢族眞不愧是「忍辱負重」的臣民，死幾個人總不介意。何况殺人乃英雄天職，而死者也還是應遭刦數。</p>
<p>應遭刦數的固然是該死，殺人得諸天賦的據說也有些來歷。所以英雄大都屬於星宿。紫薇星，武曲星，白虎星之類，只要凡心一動，便得謫往下界，去做一回英雄。所以凡人只是凡人而已，英雄的條件是必須與生俱來的。</p>
<p>謫限一滿，星宿歸位。於是又另有一批下來。</p>
<p>但中國人大都不欽仰當代偉人，而喜歡先朝英雄。羅通盤腸大戰，武松獨手擒方臘，以至於黑旋風拿著二條板斧，殺進江州城，不問官兵百姓，逢人便砍。說起來總覺得有些痛快，好像並没有血淋淋這一回事。可是羅通武松，郤因此喪命：黑旋風殺了一陣，也還不能不逃上梁山泊去。獨有清世祖旣殺得堂皇，而於已非但無損，反倒有益。可見英雄可爲，方法郤不能不講究。最講究做英雄方法的。是曹孟德。他曾特地跑到星相家那里去請敎，星相家明知他是好雄，郤加了一句，說他是「治世能臣，亂世好雄」，孟德也明知當時是亂世。心頭便禁不住非常高興。金聖嘆大概漏了一筆，因爲這恐怕正是爲後文煑酒論英雄「張本」。</p>
<p>此外還有一個「不能流芳百世，亦當遺臭萬年」的桓温。</p>
<p>但我所談及的，郤是清世祖。</p>
<h3 id="c220">關於批評 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 侍桁</p>
<p>最近在雜誌或報紙副刋上，談論關於批評的文字是有了不少。但歸納這些文字的意見，大抵不外於此；希望批評者不要講個人的意氣的話，應當只就着著作的本身而論，更不應當的是以批評作了人身攻擊的利器。像這樣的文字裏無形中表示出來的意見是，雖然對於現今的批評文章非常不滿，而又十分熱烈地希望批評，希望那能使人滿意的公正的批評。這可以說是代表了大多數人的意見，——没有人不在這樣希望着。</p>
<p>使作家或讀者對於目前的批評感到十分地厭惡，而不能不出來抱怨一番，目前的批評家們是不能不負責任的。但在如今的中國文壇，其所以不能有較好的批評文字出現的客觀條件的不充份，我想，寫批評文字的人也應當提出來供給一般抱怨者作參考的。</p>
<p>第一，把人身攻擊的膞駡的文字一般都看作批評於是便來非難批評，這對於批評是最不利的事，因爲這種看法是容易使人養成一種不正確的觀念，以爲在批評裏本來就有謾駡的這一門，而謾駡者自己也以爲是在作着批評。於是謾駡越多而批評也越不會出現了。其次我們應當不應當反省一下，在過去的評壇上，我們是不是一面歡迎，一面在間接地鼓勵着謾駡呢？——看過去批評的論爭，我們不能不說愈是那屬於無味的謾駡式的，而愈是有人喜歡來參加，來觀戰，而較有意義的大家倒緘口無言了。而且甚至有人雖然一面不時地在駡着，而另一面却也非難批評，非難謾駡的批評！謾駡者和非難批評者形成了合體，結果使我們只看見批評的毁壞者，而尋不到批評的建設的人了。</p>
<p>再講，眞實的批評目前雖屬少數，但也不能說是絶對没有的：爲什麽我們不拿這些作論題，而反倒盡是談論着那些我們不認爲是批評的批評呢？置眞實的批評於不顧，而只以謾駡的批評爲論題，使眞實的批評者感到寂寞，而使謾駡者益形活躍，這無異是奬勵謾駡的。</p>

<p>找到了一片空廢的廣塲，賣解的放下了肩上背着的變戲法的傢伙放下了手裏的舊式兵器，並且也放下了幾年來相依如命的孩子。</p>
<p>從年青時起就在江湖上飄蕩，一直到自己的額上刻滿了生活的皺紋，眼睜睜的瞧着老婆死掉，女兒跟人逃走，而自己也從打拳頭賣膏藥的地位降落到靠變戲法和舞刀弄棒度日，每一想起這没有幸福的一生，賣解的心裏就要隱隱的作痛。</p>
<p>「昌！昌！」賣解的敲起了他唯一的獨手鑼，鑼聲裏帶得有他生命的哀呼，那音節是悲壯而又凄凉。</p>
<p>圍着瞧熱鬧的人漸漸多起來了，終於圍成了拷拷大的一個圈子。</p>
<p>站立在圈子的中心，賣解的照例抱拳打拱，說着江湖上的門面話。話在他口裏是已說過了不知多少次數，差不多滾瓜爛熟的了。每次重嚼着這些話語，他的心就給他帶來了難過。多麽難擺脫的生活的得擔呵！</p>
<p>獨自在觀衆前戲起了武藝，賣解的心裏是寂寞的。同時，那兵器上的鐵銹更引起他的感傷：這彷彿象徴着他現實的生命，過去的光芒熌爍的時代是過去了，現實所遺留給他的就只有這些鐵銹。他把兵器倒插在地上，絶望的呼聲幾乎衝出他口來。</p>
<p>戲完了所有的本領，回答的報酬却只是一些鄙夷的「嘘嘘」，没有人扔下一個銅子兒來。在這樣的場合下，賣解的只有忍氣呑聲的倒拖着兵器，走回放傢伙的地方。「人老珠黃不值錢」的念頭很快的在他心上一閃，使他完全喪失了開口乞錢的勇氣。</p>
<p>經過了這最初的失敗，於是便換了孩子來出馬了。孩子是只有八九歲光景，身材很矮小，却用盡了吃乳的氣力揮舞着拳脚，並且咬緊了牙關在地上翻觔斗豁虎跳竪靖蜓。瞧着爲了生活使這未成年的孩子拚着性命的玩把戲的形狀，賣解的眼裏開始有了眼淚。</p>
<p>然而看衆的慾望却滿足了。他們是把别人的痛苦當做一種樂趣的。如若這孩子能因用力過度而流血死在他們面前。那他們一定會發狂地扔着銅子。就因爲他暫時還不至於到那地步，所以喝采聲雖響成一片，扔銅子的却只有疏疏落落的幾個。</p>
<p>爲了要想多得幾個錢，也爲了要想滿足觀衆殘酷的心理，賣解的開始命孩子在寒風裏精赤着上身，伏在一口變戲法用的大　上，而他自己則執着一把銹了的青龍刀，用刀背在孩子背脊上重重的打着，刀背是厚而且冷，每一次打下，孩子便發出一障痛苦的呻吟，背上的皮膚由白而紅而變成青紫。立刻，觀衆都怪聲呌起好來了，銅子如雨點般扔滿了一地。然而賣解的却像没有瞧見似的，他只覺得手裏的刀背打的不是孩子，却是自己一顆心，每一次打下，心就像被砍了一刀般痛楚得難受。</p>
<p>天黑下來了，觀衆漸漸的散了開去，賣解的也用他那一套爛熟的門面話結束了這一個場面。他滿足地收拾起地上的銅子，重新把傢伙背上肩頭，把兵器揑在手裏，另一隻空着的手却不自主的慈愛地伸出來，撫摸着正在穿衣服的孩子受傷的背脊。</p>
<p>「辛苦了！孩子，咱們走吧！」</p>
<p>說出了這短短的幾句，賣解的眼裏隱藏了多時的眼淚，終於忍不住滾下面頰來了。</p>

<p>— 俊之</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>嘉靖中，有進士朱大韶，性好藏書，特殊是歡喜宋時鏤版。某次，他訪得吳門故家，藏有宋　袁宏「後漢記」，是陸放翁，劉須溪，謝疊山三家的手評本，他很想獲得。無如對方不賣，弄得他無可如何。最後總算談好了，就是用一個美婢去換。這婢女是會做詩的，臨行時，她寫一首詩在牆上道；</p>
<p>無端割愛出深閨，猶勝前人換馬時；</p>
<p>他日相逢莫惆悵，春風吹盡道旁枝。</p>
<p>大韶讀此，雖覺着惋惜，爲着宋版書，他也祇好「割愛」了。此事見「遜志堂雜抄」，類公曾引入其所作「嫩窩筆記」中。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>朱彛尊（竹垞）也是一個愛書狂者。他曾做過一回很有趣味的「竊鈔」的事。那是錢牧齋手鈔秘本甚多，出入自隨，不輕易給人看，竹垞累謀不得。有一晚，牧齋到外面赴宴會，竹垞就趁這個時候，買通牧齋的「侍書小史」，「啓鐍預置楷書生數十於密室，半宵寫成，而仍返之。」這件事後來當然拆穿了。竹垞「竊鈔」之事，就因此哄傳於大江南北。</p>

<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>「不，我的孩子，這是不可能的。這樣便會把我們兩人都判到地獄裏去。這一個月來，我已嘗到這種刑罰的味道了。你現在感動着，可是當這種感動之情過去了的時候，當你看着我像　爾看着我一樣的時候，當你記起我所告訴你的話的時候……啊……我的小哲安，你試想想……你試想想我是你的母親呀！……」</p>
<p>「我不願你離開我，媽媽，我祇有你了。」</p>
<p>「可是我的孩子你得想想我們再不能看見了彼此不會紅臉，我不會感着羞得要死，而你的眼睛不會使得我的眼睛垂下來。」</p>
<p>「這不是眞的，媽媽。」</p>
<p>「是的，是的，這是眞的！啊！我懂得你那可憐的哥哥的一切内心的爭鬭，從第一天起所有的一切内心的爭鬭。現在，當我聽到他走進屋時，我的心便跳到要把我的胸脯都衝破了，當我聽到了他的聲音時，我便覺得我會要暈了過去。那時我還有着你呢！現在你也没有了。啊！我的小哲安，你以爲我能夠和你們兩個一塊生活嗎？」</p>
<p>「啊！啊！這那裏是可能的事呢！」</p>
<p>「是的，這是可能的。」</p>
<p>「你怎能要我看見你們兩人時不再想起這事呢？難道你們會不再想起這事嗎，你們？」</p>
<p>「我嗎，我可以發誓！」</p>
<p>「可是你每天會時時刻刻想起這事的。」</p>
<p>「不會，我向你發誓。並且，你聽我說啦：假如你走了，我便會自殺。」她簡直被他這種幼稚的威脅嚇倒了，她摟緊他，帶着一種熱情的温柔撫摸着他。他接下去說道：</p>
<p>「我愛你的程度實在超過了你的想像，超過了狠多。來，不要胡鬧罷。你祇試着留住八天看看。你答應給我留住八天嗎？你總不能拒絶我這個要求罷？」</p>
<p>她把兩手擱在哲安的肩上，伸直手臂抓着他的臂膀說：</p>
<p>「我的孩子……讓我們寗靜點不要感動。先讓我說罷。假使我有一次聽到你的嘴裏說出我這一個月來從你哥哥的嘴裏聽到的話，假使我有一次從你的眼睛裏看出了我從他的眼睛裏看到過的意思，假使我從一個字或一個眼色猜到了我在你的心目中也像在他的心目中一樣可憎的話……一個鐘頭以後，你聽到嗎，一個鐘頭以後……我便會一去永不再返了。」</p>
<p>「媽媽，我向你發誓……」</p>
<p>「讓我說罷……一個月來我已經受着了一個人所能受着的痛苦。從我懂得你的哥哥，我的另一個兒子在懷疑着我，並且他一分鐘一分鐘地猜着了事實的那刹時起，我一生的任何時間都成了我不能對你解說的一種苦難。」</p>
<p>她的聲音是那般沉痛，竟使哲安感染了她的痛苦，兩眼孕滿着淚水。</p>
<p>他想抱吻她，可是她把他推開說：</p>

<h3 id="c260">談氣量 <a href="#c260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— 墨徒</p>
<p>氣量，中國人是一向偑服着的。</p>
<p>在歷史上打你左臉，再給以右臉的敎條雖没有，而「唾面自乾」等一類格言，却早就傳爲美談的。這種氣量只中國人的此雅度。</p>
<p>但在外國則不然，能有如此慷慨的人可就少，豈待没有這般寛宏大量的，而且小得可以。只須看了近來荷印政府的限制我國爆竹入口的禁例就可知道。其所限制入口的理由，據說是因爲一多數含有猛烈火藥，殊屬危險的緣故，（原文見三月二十一報載）。</p>
<p>爆竹，誰都知道不過是一種玩意兒，内中雖「多數含有猛烈火藥」，但爲數有限，充其量，也不過是用來嚇嚇想像中的鬼魅罷了，從不曾聽見爆竹有代替了開花砲手榴彈的效用過。它那花花綠綠的外表，與轟然像煞有介事的聲音，是即使小孩見了也不畏懼的。何况放的又大都是中國人，與荷印人的經濟無關。然而荷印政府却這樣小心，認爲「殊屬危險，」而限制入口了。這倘如不是洋大人的不識貨，那便是氣量的關係了。</p>
<p>返觀我國，每年由外洋輸入「多數含有猛烈火藥」的槍砲，計達千百萬左右，然而我們一般民衆雖天天生活在砲火之下，却像習慣了似的，對此每年鉅額輸入的殺人利器，絲毫不覺得「危險」，也從未加以禁止過。反之，則頗有買獻了汗血給一般人做這賣買的本錢的，四川省的錢糧不是已有預徴到民國六十年以上，而遭到了四百七十八九次（據上海週報統計，虚一位者，轟停筆時又有新紀錄出現也。）的内戰嗎！出了錢，買「多數含有猛烈火藥」的槍砲來轟戰，更陪上了自己的身體做靶子，這氣量，還夠不上說得大？</p>
<p>但氣量小的，也未始没有。那就是玩槍砲者流，往往「告化子耐不得討飯」一不客氣，就須較量一下的，這自然是說的國内，對外則仍然會還到「他要什麽，就給什麽」的氣量上去的，我們原是酷愛「和平」的民族啊！</p>
<h3 id="c261">李先生們的悮會 <a href="#c261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>— 雨</p>
<p>朋友李君之渡進熱戀生活，是最近一月以内的事。因爲在他腦海裏突然樹立了一個無上權威一，所以他的生活顯然是比從前有條理，豐富多了。那一向是亂七八糟的前樓，現在變成了佈置井然；茶几上添了插着鮮花的花瓶，墻壁上掛着稀疏有緻的畫片，案頭玻璃鏡框裏面，已經由他自己的影子，變成拈花微笑的安琪兒，枕頭套子也是去舊更新，而且上面很精緻地剌繡着Ｍy　Ｄear的字樣，並附綴着省略成爲字母的上下欵了。</p>
<p>那滿屋改頭換面的佈置，無往而不給與一個只要有三分聽明的人以有力的暗示：這房屋主人的生活，近來是無疑地「在愛情中」了！</p>
<p>在一個星期六的晚上，李君吻别了他的愛人之後，充滿了快樂，回到自己寓所來。時鐘已表示着去九點不遠，他點燃一支香烟，一面很從容的吸着，一面悠然神往地回憶那整個下午他從她那方面所領受的温韾和甜寗。</p>
<p>「篤篤」的高跟鞋在下面弄堂裏由遠而近，終於敲着他自己寓所的門。那夜晚的訪問者對於他是一點也不能引起注意的。因爲他的她這時是絶對不會來，此外更没有會在這時來過訪的女友。他接着聽見那敲門者在樓下和娘姨講話，找「李先生」。然而這一點也不足奇，二樓另外眞是有一個「李先生」，不過那一「李」，這時却正在醫院裏割鼻子。</p>
<p>但是，今晚的來客却出乎他的意料之外，「篤篤」的皮鞋一直闖上了三樓！進一步在他房門外輕輕地敲了兩下「密士突李！」</p>
<p>「奇哉！怪哉？」——他一面在頭腦裏劃着「？」和「！」符號，一面開門去應付那個「不速之客」</p>
<p>「找誰」？他一面在打招呼，一面對於那女訪問者上下觀察一番。洋紅的嗶嘰裙子，上面是穿的一件華僑學生常穿之有條子紋路的，軋在褲腰裏的洋絨襯衫，圓的領口，中間伸出來一段很細腻的粉頸，團團的面孔，雖然不很漂亮，但是給她那兩顆黑白分明，水汪汪的眼珠一陪襯，「總平均」的分數，却不應在七十分以下。</p>
<p>「密士突李在不在家？」</p>
<p>「他是住在二樓，前天進醫院去了。你有甚麽話，可以……」</p>
<p>「呵！進醫院去了？是的，他一向是很瘦弱而多病的……」</p>
<p>這一位姓「李」的朋友知道那女客是鬧了「雙包案」的錯悮，因爲他分明知道住醫院的一位密士突「李」，是一個一點也不「瘦弱」的「大塊頭」。但是也不便說明，只好含含糊糊，拿幾句話好打發她走路。</p>
<p>「他恐怕一兩天不會回來，你有話可以留下條子，或者明天到醫院去找他，那醫院是在……」</p>
<p>「唉！我有很急的事，因爲在住儉德學社，欠了六塊錢的房租——都是出門的人，不怕你先生見笑——（說時，勉强做了一點羞澀的表情），今天茶房竟拒絶爲我開門！那位李先生從前答應帮助我，現在偏偏又生病，弄得我今晚就成問題……」</p>
<p>「你可以明天去找他……」</p>
<p>「但是，今晚……先生是不是可以帮我一點忙？……」</p>
<p>「萬分對不起！我一共只剩了十五個銅板！」</p>
<p>「那麽……我今晚住宿問題就解决不了！可不可以在先生這裏借住一晚，我是在難中！何况你我都是上流社會的人，男女關係是不成問題的……」說時，面部表面由「莊嚴」而漸轉紅暈。</p>
<p>「這個……本來是不成問題，但是，我是結過婚的人，内人在蘇州敎書，每逢星期六的晚間就一定到上海來，所以没有法子，對不起……」他一面說謊，一面把像片指給　　。</p>
<p>那奇怪的女訪問者，由九點鐘一直纒到十點半，才一無所獲，失望而去。</p>
<p>這姓李的朋友充滿了驚奇，馬上去找一個住在同一弄堂的姓趙的朋友，告訴他今晚的「奇遇」。</p>
<p>「那女的我是知道的，可是不曉得姓名，她曾在電影院裏「吊」上了老「雷」，老雷走了，她在老雷寓所裏又纒住了老「李」，幾次三番向他要錢，老李爲她退避三舍，後來又在街上遇着那女子，信口開河，說他搬在「ＸＸ里十九號」……」</p>
<p>「糟糕」！十九號，她就找到我這也是一個老李了！」</p>
<p>第二天，老李遇着他的愛人「達爾林！謝謝的像片，簡直是有「姜太公在此諸神遠避的魔力……」</p>
<p>「甚麽！小鬼頭！拿我比姜太公？豈有此理！</p>
<p>當他把昨晚的一段「艷遇」赤裸裸地告訴給她時，她竟笑得喘不過氣來！</p>
<h3 id="c262">裁判員被毆事件 <a href="#c262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— 之</p>
<p>這兩天的報紙介紹給我們兩個好新聞；一是「日本皇軍」又在進攻察東，一是江大體育恊會裁判員被交大學生毆傷。</p>
<p>這個年頭兒，體育提倡的特别厲害，球大王特别出風頭，球賽的號召，也比什麽都有力，這自然要歸功於報紙的鼓吹，敎育家的奬勵，纔造成這個虚榮風習，披靡一時，裁判員之被毆傷，也正是這虚榮之風醖成的結果。</p>
<p>一年有一回江大足球比賽，一年就有一回毆傷事件—或則球員受傷，或則裁判員被毆，傷害别人的生命，是何等殘忍的行爲，不幸學府裏面的那些未來的學士們爲了一時的虚榮而大家都以殘忍對待，江大比賽的盛况，就是這麽一回事。</p>
<p>然而，全然責備學生們之野蠻，那是不應該的。辦敎育的人專以提倡體育爲榮譽，學校的設備，學生的學業，都是次要的賽球可以稱王號覇，那才是頭等要緊的事，那末，收買選手，也是勢所必然。選手一身爲學校榮譽之所關，自可洋洋得志，目空一切，到了比賽關頭，也自然必拚命取得勝利，否則，身價掃地，那是不值得的。再則報紙宣揚，球迷傾倒，也是使選手們担着胸膛，握着拳頭的一個誘惑力。</p>
<p>中國的一切，都向着歪的方向發展，整個社會的心，都浮動在虚榮兩字上面，這原因是負着虚榮的人，纔可在這個社會里找活路，選手比賽勝利了，經學校一奬，報紙一吹，球迷一棒，那就是有聲有色，天字第一號的人物了。這樣還有誰不捨身赴戰，還有誰不以戰勝爲第一義！自然戰敗的，會由懊喪而憤慨，而發洩，而漫駡，而拳脚交加。</p>
<p>這種事件之發生，自然值得有心的人們嘆息一番，但我可以簡切的說，這是一般人追求虚樂的結局，這是中國社會環境因循演變必然產生的現象。敎育家看了這件事要嘆息，中國敎育破產了，但請向敎育家們爲什麽在那提倡錦標比賽的時候，舉行什麽誓師，慶祝……等典禮，把「爲學爭光」的榮譽去鼓動那些選手們的熱情呢？輿論家看了這件事也大家責難這種野蠻的行動，但請問輿論家們爲什麽平日提倡虚榮那麽起勁，宣揚選手們的神武，那樣舖張？革命家看了件事，也許要傷心民族的私鬥太勇，而公敵太怯了，可是，革命家呵，環繞於今日青年之週圍的，盡是虚榮，欺詐，誘惑的勢力，激於公憤的事，從何而生。</p>
<p>今日的野蠻行動充滿了全社會，我們不能夠獨只責難大學生太野蠻，今日的敎育全是這麽一套，也說不上敎育破產了，今日國人的心理全是懷抱着私鬥的憤勇，更不能獨怪這些大學生們怯於公敵。我們如果要責備，只能責備今日的中國社會太壞，社會與個人一天天地分離，個人與國家一天天地分離，即是說，社會，國家和個人成爲三個利害衝突的東西，在今日中國現實生活裏表現着。</p>
<p>中國，眞的没有一件事是合理的，是握着正義之旗的，我們要詛咒，也只能詛咒整個的社會。那麽，就讓我們詛咒一下，詛咒那些收買球員做爲「爲校爭光」的敎育家！詛咒那鼓動一般人走向虚榮之路的輿論家！</p>
<p>那位身遭傷害的裁判員，也應在詛咒之列，詛咒他甘做虚榮的傀儡！</p>

<p>— 一蘋</p>
<p>ＸＸ：</p>
<p>從商務印書館買了幾本書出門來，一輛被陽光照耀着電光閃閃的汽車從我面前飛過。喲，ＸＸ，是你？我幾乎喊出聲來。但是汽車早已向北駛去，一陣汽油臭味的烟還停留在空氣中，兩顆腦袋印在車後的玻璃窗上被　迷糊了，最後是瞧不見什麽而僅能嗅到汽油的臭味了。</p>
<p>ＸＸ，那位坐在你身旁的紳士，大概就是你的丈夫了。他有令人悚然起敬的態度，他有代步的汽車，在我幾秒鐘的一瞥中，他整個的人是那樣可愛，你母親壓迫着你去嫁他是有十足的理由的，對於那時你的堅决反對，幾乎放過一個終身的好機會，我認爲你也太不會替自己打算了。</p>
<p>你母親僅有你一個女兒，她貴煞心機爲你徴求着遣樣條件適合的婆家，即使你不爲自己打算，也得體諒牠老人家的苦心。知道嗎？女婿有半子之靠；如其我是個像你母親那般的老婦人，我心目中的女婿或者有更苛求的條件，否則我寗願我的女兒做老姑娘的，這是女孩兒家的終身大事，何况做母親的還有半子之靠！</p>
<p>那輛汽車已無影無踪了，就是汽油的臭味也在空氣中溶化了，我還在呆呆地扶着幾本書思這着這些不干我的事。我是個男子，永遠没有做母親的那般的心理，即使做男子的愛他的女兒更甚於做母親的，我是個未婚的男子，離結婚的奬幾千萬里，即使退一萬步說（因爲我的條件是不適合於每個女兒的母親）有一個母親出乎意外的肯將女兒嫁給我，不過是否我能做一個女兒的爸爸，是誰都不能預料的事。</p>
<p>歸到自己的小樓，我呆望着你給我的照像，我想出了神，我悔恨我不是個女兒身，我可以掛了許多條件，徴求我終身大　的伴侶，像你身旁的紳士一樣，他有令人悚然起敬的態度，他有代步的汽車，他是那樣的可愛。讓我的母親歡喜歡喜，他有那般的半子之靠的女婿，他吃素誦經之餘，談起來豈笑歪了嘴？可憐啊，我是個男子！</p>
<p>天色漸漸的昏暗下來，小樓中瞧不見數尺以外的事物了，你的照片也逐漸糢糊，我頭向後一仰，雙脚放到寫字檯上，學着紳士的風度痴想起來，可惜嘴唇邊缺乏一枝氣派十足的雪茄。</p>
<p>我是一個男子已無可辦的事了，然則我應該有令人悚然起敬的態度，有代步的汽車，使人一見了那樣的可受。我旣不能使自己的母親歡心，也要使人家的母親歡心，做一個每個母親心中條件適合的半子之靠的女婿。然而——我什麽都没有，僅僅是一個男子——一個不能使自己母親歡心和人家母親歡心的男子啊！</p>
<p>於是我感傷起來，我這個男子生到世界上來對誰何都没有利益，我每天工作，每天吃飯，爲着什麽呢？而且是那樣的努力！</p>
<p>ＸＸ，你或者認爲我太『情感』，不過我好久没聽見『情感的東西』的嬌駡聲了。嗨，大概是罷，我是個『情感的男子』！</p>
<p>那我應該每天工作，每天吃飯，爲了『情感』兩個字的尊稱。</p>
<h3 id="c264">「逐臭之夫」？ <a href="#c264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— 賓符</p>
<p>天氣一天天的冷了起來，人們都貪戀着暖熱的被窩。誰高興大清早就起來做事呢？可是，天下偏偏有『不受享福』『不識相』的人，無論是冷到『天冰地凍』，每天一到了天光剛將發白的時候，便大聲的『啊——喔』的來將堂衖尾呌擾了，這正是人們睡味最濃的時候！不要說是老爺合太太，就是王媽跟張媽之流，也正要合眼將息呢。可是他們却偏要『呀——喔』地來噪擾，那無疑是『被窩裏的人們』所厭惡的，他們是誰？他們就是倒馬桶的工人。</p>
<p>倒馬桶的工人有男有女，有老有少，大概每一輛的糞車總是一男一女搭檔着，一個推，一個拉，而這一男和一女的關係，父女母子固然也有，比較的以夫婦爲最多。</p>
<p>假如說新聞記者的工作時間是在晚上，銀行洋行……職員的工作時間在於白晝，而那倒馬桶的工人的工作時間就在於晚上以後白晝以前的清晨。</p>
<p>他們在每天未發亮的時候，就從被窩中鑽了出來，推着或拉着『馬桶』車到街上來了。妻赤着脚，夫也赤着脚，妻的胸前縛着『糞車』的索子，用力把脚托着地，身子前撲得和地面平行一般，這樣的使盡氣力拖拉着；夫的身子也屈得和妻子平行的，用力前推着；有的時候也許拉的是夫，推的是妻。這樣的到東到西，夫呌了聲『呀』，妻應了聲『喔』，去叩打每個人家的後門，去載取每個人家的男女老幼的排泄物。</p>
<p>倒馬桶的工人他們難道没有看愛情？他們難道没有像太太老爺們般的在暖熱的被窩裏多睡一忽兒的心情？外而限制他們這種心情的是他們的職務，逼迫他</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>們着這職務的是他們的生活。</p>
<p>對於排泄物的厭惡是人們的天才。於是，間接地使人們對於倒馬桶的工人也没有好感了。假如不幸而在馬路上碰了倒馬桶車，人們簡直没有不是露着『若恐挽焉』的驚惶神氣而『悻悻然去之的』。</p>
<p>難道倒馬桶的男女都是天生的『逐臭之夫』嗎？聽明的人總該知道這是『未盡然也』罷。</p>
<p>他們的感覺正同普天下的人們一般，然而在生活的皮鞭之下，他們不得不違反着他們的天性這麽幹。</p>
<p>『排泄』是動物自然的結果，假如没有他們去幹這工作，後患眞是不堪設想—他們的工作是艱難辛苦的，他們的報酬却是微薄的，他們多偉大—他們難道是『逐臭之夫』？『逸居無敎』只知投機營利的人們纔眞是『逐臭之夫！』</p>
<p>我每看到拉馬桶車的夫婦常傾偑羡慕着他們合作的精神，而覺得一個完美的家庭，應當建築在這種精神的上面的。</p>
<h3 id="c265">雨整日夜的餓 <a href="#c265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— 列火</p>
<p>很僥倖的，一二八滬戰時竟没有挨到餓，却在遺芳百世的淞滬停戰恊定之後，回到原籍去，在湘鄂的火車道上餓了兩整日夜，這是永遠不會遺忘的生命一頁。</p>
<p>當東洋兵開始向天通庵砲擊之夜，我又與方先生由待遇的刻薄而衝突而决裂了，方先生也知道已是萬難挽回了的事——太太，老太爺全都向我進過勸言，我還是捲起被包要走，却不料方先生的好朋友奚先生在樓下緊急的敲起門來了。</p>
<p>奚先生田螺似的忙轉上小樓，没頭没腦的亂說；「Ｘ先生，打起來了，哎，不得了！方先生睡了吧？方先生睡了吧？」我還没有回答，嗅覺聽覺像貓狗一樣靈敏的方先生，居然毫無差誤的知道是他的好朋友奚先生來了，前廂房的樓門口，顯出半個油頭，乾脆的這麽五個字：「奚先生，請進！」</p>
<p>奚先生上樓去了，我重新估量我的渺茫的前路。東洋兵打起來了，這，就整個的民族國家講，無疑的又會倒幾千年代黃胄祖宗的𢰲：但放我却總是一個　脫這囚籠的好機會。風聲確是很緊，離此以後，也許全無生路；然而我有把握，我可虫當義勇軍，老錢已經去了，他準可介紹我去，舍了條命不要，去打日帝國主義，去打一切帝國主義，我决然要離開這囚獄，一年來我夠寃　了。</p>
<p>正在這樣估量，奚先生進來了；「方先生誠懇的要我來挽留，風聲是這麽緊，Ｘ先生，留請住下，住下！」說着說着他就爲我解被包，這當然是方先生指點他的。在生疏的奚先生面前，我到底有些不便扳面孔，不由得唯唯的「唔」了一聲，原來方先生就站在門外，伸脚就踏進了小樓，笑嬉嬉的說：「一切都請原諒！感謝你帮忙，帮忙！」</p>
<p>這樣，恐怖的滬戰期間，很僥倖的，又没有挨到餓。停戰恊定了，交通上已恢復了常態，於是我又進行另一方式的逃監，就是；請假一月，回籍省親，方先生居然承應了，只說請假萬萬不要超出一個月。</p>
<p>在我的迢迢的歸程中，從上海到漢口是平安的，恐怖是在湘鄂道上，爲了要趕路，漢口上坡之始，我就同芸　商定，我們乘火車回去；因爲坐輪船，最快也要一天兩夜，火車則不要一天。還記得開車是傍晚七時，預定明早可到長沙，却不料開出去了兩段十五里的小站，又倒開轉來，據說是煤和水没有上足，但也有人說是前頭出了亂子。後來車還是欲進欲退的開出去，到了蒲沂，再不前進了，而且頭等二等廂裏忽然混亂起來，說是匪怖滿了鐵路的兩旁，大批的傷兵只管向我們的四等廂裏撞來，這是我們必然要挨的苦，頭等二等廂裏雖是空空的，但傷兵是要向我們這已擠得水洩不通的四等廂裏撞來的。</p>
<p>傷兵的血淚儘管流，沙喉儘管亂呌，他們是在夢裏完結了人生的意義呵！</p>
<p>就此停上了兩整日，平日多着的小販，都不知到那裏去了，我下車去小解，發現旁路上有一具賣大餅的死屍。</p>
<p>足足餓過整兩日夜，我們才在恐怖中抵達長沙，滬戰時没有挨到餓，却在停戰恊定之後，遭受了這一幕，天乎人乎？</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（四十）現在不是我們的戀愛的時候</p>
<p>那信上寫的是：</p>
<p>弟弟，</p>
<p>老實說到上海來將近一年，所給我的回憶是太使我悲痛，我的走也是出於不得意，弟弟，我永遠記着現在不是戀愛的時候，而况我是個不能結婚的女子</p>
<p>在鄉下受叔父的壓迫，並不是使我不能順受，我毅然决然犧牲了我的名譽投到上海的抱懷中來，但是上海給我的是什麽呢？雖然我自己没有貫澈所定的主意，也担任一分過失的。弟弟我並不是個戀愛至上主義者，說什麽戀愛就是人生，我也並不想把你攫取過來作爲我的俘虜；不過我愛你是不能瞞過你的事實。在火車上，在旅館中，最後我們一同踏進正誼社，你並没有拒絶我的輸愛，這也你瞞不過我的事實。至於慧琴出現在我們面前，我以爲是不值得和人家爭勝負的，然而想不到一個男子的心是那樣容易的改變。弟弟，我永遠永遠記着現在不是我們戀愛的時候，從你最初的一句到最後的一句，所以我走了。</p>
<p>女子是天賦的嫉妬性，我想我的一走，或者將這樣判定莫須有的罪名的。我自己却不承認是個女子，爲了我太不知女子的天性是嫉妬，我失敗了。雖然我可以盡我的全力把你奪過來，我自信有這把握，這種强人之所難的行爲，我却不願意幹，因爲我不是一個女子，没有女子天賦的嫉妬性。並且—弟弟，現在不是我們戀愛的時候？</p>
<p>我走了，我將獻身比戀愛更重要的工作，帝國主義的鐵蹄已虎視眈眈的擇人而噬，我希望正誼同人努力你們所定的宗旨，或者我們在某一個塲合再有遇見的時候。記着吧，我將大臉的對正誼社會的同人說：「現在不是我們戀愛的時候！」</p>
<p>别了，弟弟，别了，正誼社同人。</p>
<p>「好！我是從此不做女人的夢，現在不是我們戀愛的時候！」小黃將信紙一摔，站起身來像宣誓似的那樣扮着正經面孔。　　「我們的忠實同志！」我拍拍他的肩頭，對於敏姊的事已風平浪靜了。</p>
<p>「同志！」他脚跟一并，舉起手來，行軍禮對於他再自然没有的樣子。</p>
<p>「現在不是我們戀愛的時候！」我將信紙撕的粉碎，向空中一揮，紙屑蝴蝶似的舞起來。</p>

<h3 id="c267">却爾斯法雷現在在那裏？ <a href="#c267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>— 廣道</p>
<p>他已重返銀幕拍攝新片</p>
<p>還有段極有價值之談話</p>
<p>前幾天在大上海看珍妮蓋諾（IanetGaynor）主演的「小妹妹」（PaddytheNextBestThing），和她一同主演的，是位華納裝士德（WarnerBacter）。看完了就有許多人想起了和珍妮蓋諾合作八九年的老搭擋却爾斯法雷（CharlesFarrell），很開心地問，却爾斯法雷這許久没有看見，到底上那裏去了。因此，我想這個消息是大家所急要知道的，我就將他最近的消息和談話，報告一下。</p>
<p>據最近的消息，却爾斯法雷經過了一次長期休息之後，現在已經回到好萊塢，重新開始拍戲了。他重返銀幕後的第一張片子，是呌“ＡggieAppleby”，是雷電華出品。聽說他自從脫離狐狸公司之後，他不願和任何公司簽訂長期合同。他祇要有好的劇本給他，他就肯做。不然的話，他寗可犧牲金錢上的收入，不願意隨便拍戲。這是他要對於觀衆，不使他們失望的緣故。他從前曾一次脫離華納兄弟公司，和最近的脫離狐狸公司，都是因爲公司方面，没有滿意的角色給他做，使他不得不拂袖而去。現在他重回銀幕，頗有堅持他的主張，不濫拍片子，不受長期合同的拘束的意思。以下就是最近發表的一些談話：</p>
<p>「我以前太忠厚了，太隨便了。因此他們都呌我「好說話却利」。但是在好來塢，這是很吃虧的。你自己要不認眞，人家亦就看得你不值錢了。在好萊塢求成功，須如在戰場上，要建立一條前綫。」以上係法雷的感想。他已經認清了他過去的錯誤。他這次重返銀幕，是帶了一副戰鬥的精神來的。他又說：「我從前實在太和善了，對外没有一道防綫。這種和平之德發達得過份了，就引出許多弊病來，凡人家不肯作的角色，我都肯作。所以許多别的演員，都搶在前頭去爭奪好的片子，對於公司方面，還有種種挑揚，獨有我在後面等人家挑選完了。剩下的歸我，毫無怨言，久而久之，公司方面明白却爾斯法雷是一個無可無不可的好好先生，亦就漸漸不加重視了。」</p>
<p>大凡世界上的事，都是如此。至於和平之德，謙讓的精神，固然是好的；但是「過猶不及」，過於謙恭了，往往自召悔辱。在國家方面，不抵抗主義的可以喪家亡國，固然已經得到了一個證例，而在私人方面，一個人處於社會，倘若一味退後讓人，毫無前進的精神，也不是個好事情。所以過於爭競也不好，過於退讓也不好。却爾斯法雷的話，實在有許多社會處世的哲理，在乎其中。他又說：</p>
<p>「如果我稍爲堅强一點，自己拿自己當作一位大明星看待，對待外人能有一個確定立塲，不一味專講明友情面，那末公司方面就不敢，亦不肯，將那些人家不要的角色給我了。我眼看著許多不及我的演員們，在和分司方面爭論之中，得到了勝利。什麽道理呢？就是公私界限要分得清楚。事業歸事業，决不讓情感攙雜其中的緣故」。以上的話，不一定對於却爾斯法雷，或是一個電影演員於此，無論什麽人，都是如此。所謂「尊其觀瞻，人亦望而敬之。」不然，自視卑卑，人亦從而卑卑之矣。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c268">評「囚鳳笑史」 <a href="#c268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— 摩爾</p>
<p>“The　Misleading　Lady”</p>
<p>電影當局常喜歡拿「禁映」兩字來宣傳，這種抓緊觀衆心理的方法，自然十分有效的，但是在上海因爲有租界與非租界之分，往往有許多不能在租界放映的影片，就在非租界的戲院開映。于是這被租界當局禁映的「囚鳳笑史」就在放映過蘇聯名片「生略」「金山」的上海大戲院放映了。</p>
<p>實在的，在「囚鳳笑史」裏，我們找不出什麽禁映的理由來。它只是一張普通的戀愛喜劇，在世界紀未的人們，因爲他們意識着自己的没有未來，而在目前還没有没落的時候，盡量的娱樂一下，這種「今我不樂，日月其逝」的心理的反映，就是一般醇酒婦人影片產生的主因。自然，因爲種種事實的限制，他們即使想盡情娱樂，還是不可能的，于是他們只能幻想出種種出乎意料之外的奇遇。至於合理不合理，是不去管他的，同時也只有不合理纔符合他們的幻想。「囚鳳笑史」不消說就是這樣的，它把這種故事寫成笑劇，更是必然的結果，因爲他們的創作這種故事是不會寫成悲劇來使自巴悲苦的，所謂「遇酒且呵呵，人生能幾何」！</p>
<p>當然，在「囚鳳笑史」裹，是宣洩了他們生活的無聊，不過這并不是有意的</p>
<p>眞正優秀的舊藝人是很清楚的了解自己的命運而不能掩飾他的悲哀，其他效模糊一點的就不是這樣了，現在歐美影片的喜劇多而悲劇少，就是這個關係。</p>
<p>克勞黛在「羅宮春色」中獲得成功，是在大導演指導之下的原因，而在「囚鳳笑史」中就減色得多了。她旣不活潑，同時也極無面部表情，而劇中却是隨處需要面部表情的。</p>
<h3 id="c269">好萊塢的耶誕節 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>好萊塢的耶誕節總覺得太温暖了，好像是穿着皮大衣啜着冰淇淋似的，可是事實却不盡然，外面儘管是照射着暖烘烘的日光，但是屋子裏面却下着片片的雪！白棉花製成的雪人，也隨着滿載醉客的汽車面到。</p>
<p>倍巴利山上的禮拜堂敲着耶誕節鐘的時候，一齊襲擊明星的是：從影迷們寄來，而堆積如山的禮物箱，和Party和Party間打電話的鈴聲，繼續不斷的鈴鈴鈴……</p>
<p>除此之外，今年還有在晚上宴會遊玩的一種驚人箱。這箱子是用五彩的顏色紙製成的，兩旁掛着細長的紙筒，將這紙筒的兩端用力一拉，碰的一聲會飛出一頂寫着：「英雄拿破倫」的軍帽，跟着出現的是載着這軍帽的，玩偶的人頭，口中還含着雪茄。又是碰的一聲，跳出一張寫着：「今年的拉，法倫鐵耐」的卡片。圍在四周的宴客就都像「傻子的狂笑」似的，哈哈哈……的笑個不停，</p>
<h3 id="c270">「青春之火」的號外 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 聖誕老人</p>
<p>年底在卡爾登演出</p>
<p>並送主演簽名照片</p>
<p>天一公司同人選舉爲一九三三之冠軍作「青春之火，」確係該公司之努力作。該片自上月攝竣後，卽運京審查。刻已審畢，已由京運滬。現定於本月二十九號在卡爾登大戲院公演。主演陳玉梅在該片中之表演成績有特殊之猛進。陳女士自認爲得意作品。導演裘芑香亦有頗多驚人之貢獻。小聽每與暗示亦十分精彩。加之影壇新發現之東方模範美人葉秋心合演。更爲該片生色不少。攝影技巧與光綫，均較天一前期作品進展。該片主演陳玉梅爲酬答愛觀伊作品之觀衆起見，特印就精美之賀年片三千張，分寄本埠各界。凡接得陳玉士之賀年片，持該片往卡爾登「觀青春之火」者，當可向該院兌換陳玉梅女士簽名之最近小照一張，以示與「青春之火」之觀衆紀念云。</p>
<p>在這裏讓我們把話轉向明星們的賀耶誕節的明信片吧。下面就是關於幾位明星們明信片圖樣的叙述：</p>
<p>賈克奥凱的是：一個女傭人正和冰店的夥計親嘴的當兒，冰溶化了，猫驚跳着，花束跳到空中。</p>
<p>瑙瑪希拉的是：一片銀世界中，二隻赤色的小鹿跳舞着的模樣，這不是完全表現出她的心境麽？</p>
<p>賈克古柏的是：SantaClaus乘着一隻小船，越過像山那麽高的波浪，向着「兒童的世界」進行。</p>
<p>珍妮蓋諾的是：做雪人的少女，樹林上掛着一輪明月，雪人上寫着：「這是很冷的雪人，但是我以很大的熱情，敬賀你們快樂的耶誕節」！</p>
<h3 id="c271">方沛霖是「小灣」 <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 碧碧</p>
<p>佈景師方沛霖，大概是寗波人的緣故，所以許多人都呌他阿方哥。</p>
<p>據說：阿方哥今年二十有七，却還是使君無婦，在某一次談笑席上，阿方哥的同鄉應雲衛提議，說大家以後呌方沛霖都呌「小灣」（寗波音即小孩）」。</p>
<p>許多人問他是什麽緣故？他回答：</p>
<p>「寗波人規矩，凡是未曾娶妻的，不論他是六十歲或者七十歲，都一概呌「小灣的。」當時，把席上的人都引得笑了起來。</p>
<p>然而，阿方哥明春要討家主婆了。那末，做「小灣」的時間至多也不過幾十天哩。</p>
<h3 id="c272">袁美雲練習大楷 <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>談瑛說：「女明星應該要識幾個字，否則，隨便到什麽地方那是很不方便的。」所以，現在有幾位女明星，像王人美黎莉莉談瑛等，都還在求學時代。</p>
<p>「中國海的怒潮」主角袁美雲，天資非常聰頴，她雖在學校的時日並不怎樣長久，但學識却已大有可觀，即平日有空的辰光，她爸爸時常敎她讀書，因此她的文學也就日有進步。最近袁美雲每天早晨起來，必練習大楷一頁，從不間斷，我曾見過她的大字，確實是大有進步了。</p>
<p>這眞是一個難得的女明星，——我想。（却酬）</p>

<p>聯華二廠自從開攝「體育皇后」以來，得了敎育界和體育界很多人的帮忙，所以連日在金殿大排盛宴，由體育皇后御手親賜旨酒，略表慰勞。日前又宴請省立上海中學及兩江女子體育師範學校，該兩校對於聯華攝製這一部提倡體育普及，發揚體育眞精神的影片，極力贊助，曾由上海中學於攝取運動大會外景時，選派男女童子軍百人，軍樂隊二十人，救護隊二十人，童軍帪篷二座，到塲維持秩序和參加表演。兩江方面，亦選派女健將四十人到塲贊助。聯華公司方面，對於該兩校和其他新聞界，敎育界，體育界這種的勇敢慷慨的贊助，表示萬分的感激，因爲在歐美各國，影業公司常能得各界的全力恊助，在中國還算是難得呢。</p>

<p>— 田夫</p>
<p>喝！好家伙！偷了東西居然拿錢慷慨做好人，這是「犯罪」的行徑！可惜這行徑没有被買辦或買辦太太看見，要不然他還能夠這樣「逍遙法外」嗎？</p>
<p>但自然買辦和太太都不會看見老趙的，他們永遠不會在一起。這時候太太在公館裏睡得正甜蜜。而買辦這時候也正在紗廠裏忙碌着辦公。——半點鐘以前，買辦還被召在紗廠的大班的公館裡。那大班鼻子底下留着一撮小鬅鬚，矮矮的，是一種「異國情調」的人。態度莊嚴，凛凛然的，似乎比買辦更神氣。而買辦在他面前却顯得非常謙卑恭順了。</p>
<p>大班說：「北方一帶近來已恢復了戰前的狀態，可是上海和長江流域的營業那是不行：這是你的責任呀！」</p>
<p>這敎訓的語調，買辦聽着並不生氣。「是，是，」嘴巴子裏儘「是」着，心裏想着替大班推廣營業的妙計。——現在這妙計是已經得到大班的同意，回到廠裏來實行了。</p>
<p>這時候買辦正忙碌：指揮着廠裏的職員，把所有的紗包上原來的招紙揭去，再貼上另一張新的招紙——招紙上皇皇地印着道：「完全國貨」。由於買辦忠心，這許多標明一完全國貨」的外國紗包，不久就會源源不絶地流進國貨市塲，再濟到購買者（當然是中國人）的手裡去。可是誰知道這裡面會有「妙計」的秘密？</p>
<p>（九）受罰的靈魂</p>
<p>時間一秒一分向前爬。受傷的童丁的生命越過短促了。他的身子直僵僵地躺着，一動也不動；胸口却猛劇地起落：喉嚨像位風箱似的，困難而迫促的呼吸。眼睛半張半閉，眼珠子不知到那兒去了，剩下一綫灰色的眼白。</p>
<p>被買辦公館歇了生意的病孩的嫂嫂坐在旁邊，瞧着這情景，心裏像有什麽在一針一針用力剌。老趙的醫生是請來了，可是醫生祇看了看躺着的孩子，半句話也不說，失望地搖了幾下頭就走了。孩子的神色越看越不對，似笑非笑地，那麽半睜着眼。陳大的女人證着急了，祇是喊救命似的呌着「弟弟，弟弟！」</p>
<p>呌罷，可是呌破了喉嚨也没用：弟弟一翻眼就落了氣。</p>
<p>嫂嫂哭得仰不起頭來。站在旁邊一語不發，賠着流眼淚的是剛才請了醫生來的老趙。（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan told a Central News Agency reporter on the morning of the 25th that fierce naval battles are inevitable at the front today, and he will personally command everything if necessary. The Changmen Fortress and the naval agencies at Mawei were entirely recovered by Li Mengbin, the commander of the Mawei naval port, on the 20th.

<p>(Nanjing) According to information from British and American consulates, the rebel army advancing towards the northern border of Fujian numbers approximately 30,000. They have caused considerable disturbance along the way. Foreign missionaries who failed to evacuate earlier have retreated to Pucheng, passing through Xianxia into Zhejiang to seek refuge. Foreigners south of Jian'ou, including Yanping, have all retreated to Xiamen, or traveled to Shanghai via Fuzhou. All foreigners in northern Fujian have completely evacuated. Central government planes have been sighted in recent days for reconnaissance purposes. The puppet government is putting on a facade of calm, issuing announcements to reassure the people and strictly prohibiting them from relocating. However, in reality, those relocating are still doing so in an endless stream. The people are extremely panicked. The Fuzhou Consular Corps is closely monitoring the development of the situation. Both Britain and America have one warship each, and Japan has three warships stationed outside the mouth of the Min River, preparing to protect their citizens. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Jiang Zhiying, acting commander of the First Column of the Zhejiang Security Forces, telegraphed the provincial government stating that on the evening of the 22nd, over a thousand bandits, half of them armed, raided Linhu Jiang. The local regiment was isolated and outnumbered, retreating to defend Fangtou. Commander Gao led Yang's battalion by car on the 23rd to suppress the bandits, occupying a position on the high ground south of Yang's residence at noon. The bandits then increased to over a thousand, totaling about three thousand, occupying the high ground north of Yang's residence and launching a fierce attack. After four hours of intense fighting, they charged three or four times, still attempting to resist stubbornly. After Regiment Adjutant Wang led his troops to attack the bandits' right flank, the bandits finally collapsed at 6:30 PM, fleeing in disarray towards Zaoxi Ridge and Zhangcun. There is no longer any trace of bandits in the Linhu Jiang area. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hangzhou) Yu Jishi, Director of the Zhejiang Security Bureau, reported yesterday based on a report from Regiment Commander He of Yushan that at Chou time (1-3 AM) on the 22nd, five to six hundred Red Bandits, armed with over a hundred rifles, came from the direction of Hekou, hoping to disrupt the rear and destroy communications. On the morning of the 22nd, they gathered at Dao Shitou. The Qianshan militia heard the news and went to intercept them, but fearing they were outnumbered, they requested assistance from the Second Battalion. Battalion Commander He immediately dispatched troops, but the bandits had already fled, intending to still cross the river north. Later, the Second Battalion blocked the river crossing points and sent out scouts to track them. On the 23rd, it was reported that the bandits had fled to Zungong Bridge. Orders were issued to suppress them, but the bandits still fled back to Dao Shitou. A company was then dispatched to intercept them, occupying positions in the southwestern mountains of Dao Shitou and putting up fierce resistance against the He River battalion. After holding out for three hours, the officers and soldiers bravely climbed up, finally capturing the bandits' position, seizing 24 rifles and spare parts for automatic rifles, as well as many rifle bullets, and capturing over twenty people. Battalion Commander He's squad leader and one private were killed in action. Because it was already dark, they did not pursue them and continued to block the river crossing points. More troops were dispatched on the morning of the 24th to pursue them. The suppression is still ongoing. Yu has telegraphed a commendation. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e19">Central Government Holds Memorial Service for Yunnan Uprising <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>Ju Zheng Reports on the Purpose of the Yunnan Uprising</p>
<p>Huang Shaoxiong Reports on the Reasons for Inner Mongolia's Autonomy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held the 110th weekly memorial service at 9:00 AM on the 25th, and at the same time held a memorial service for the 18th anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. The event was attended by over 600 people, including Central Committee members Ye Chucang, Ju Zheng, Ding Weifen, Chen Lifu, Gu Zhenggang, Miao Peicheng, Li Ciwen, Chu Minyi, Xie Zuolin, Chen Shuren, Hong Ludong, Ji Liang, He Yaozu, Li Zonghuang, Wang Qi, Xiao Jishan, and representatives from various agencies and working comrades. Ju Zheng chaired the meeting, leading the attendees in paying their respects and then delivering a speech on the significance of the memorial, stating briefly that the purpose of the Yunnan Uprising was to punish Yuan Shikai because Yuan betrayed the Republic and declared himself emperor. All comrades of the party were indignant and united in condemning him. Although this campaign achieved little military success, the idea of punishing Yuan and the spirit were able to be thoroughly implemented, so in the end Yuan was overthrown and the Republic was restored. This is the significance of our memorial today. Next, Huang Shaoxiong reported on his inspection of the situation in Mongolia, stating briefly that the reasons for Mongolia's autonomy were: (1) The Japanese want to implement their Manchuria-Mongolia policy and also want to convene Mongolians in Duolun to exploit them, so the princes want to solve the problem of autonomy themselves, unwilling to be puppets, reducing the general Mongolian psychology towards the outside. It was originally a self-help method. (2) Since the Republic, Inner Mongolia has often been affected by military affairs, and Mongolians are unwilling to suffer this way any longer. (3) The princes of Inner Mongolia want to maintain the service of local youths in the local area, so they united to make this request. (4) The Mongolians feel that they were treated favorably by the Qing Dynasty, so they have a conceited psychology. With these four points, the brewing of autonomy began. He then described the process of autonomy, saying that it was launched in April and did not start meeting at Bailing Temple until September, but most of the representatives did not know the motive and only attended the meeting. So the result was many mistakes, resulting in the so-called 32-article autonomous government organization. This time, Yu investigated the actual situation and explained to the princes their mistaken idea of autonomy as independence. They also realized their mistake and accepted the central government's plan, agreeing to set up an autonomous region under the governments of the provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan. What is published in the newspapers is one-sided news and not entirely consistent with the facts. After this tour, Yu had several impressions: (1) The government should first understand the actual situation before handling border affairs, and then study it. (2) Opposing religion is not very good, but the Central Government should weigh the pros and cons of politics and religion in border affairs. (3) The Central Government must increase the number of pastures and livestock epidemic prevention offices in Inner Mongolia to benefit the Mongolian economy. (4) The education of Mongolia, Tibet and the border areas should be studied and adapted to the actual situation. (5) The Mongolian flag's judicial system is different from that of the interior, and should be specially planned. (6) The Mongolians have a very strong belief in religion, but people should not suffer because of their belief in religion, and the Central Government should urgently devise methods to improve it.

<p>(Beiping) Former Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Jiazhen arrived in Peiping this afternoon from Beijing. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Jiazhen arrived in Peiping on the 25th to inspect the recent situation in North China. He will return to Shanghai within days to welcome Zhang Xueliang. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Jiazhen discussed his impressions of his tour of Europe, stating briefly that he was sent abroad before the September 18th Incident to attend the League of Nations General Assembly. After the September 18th Incident, he handled diplomatic issues with Japan in Europe. After the League of Nations recess, he went to the United States for inspection. When the Northeast was lost, we in Europe were extremely saddened. After the League of Nations General Assembly accepted this major issue in the Far East, it sent the Lytton Commission to China to conduct an on-site investigation. After the Commission's report was published, it garnered international sympathy and obtained a just position. As for the second step of implementation by the League of Nations, although there are regulations, the European and American countries are unable to resolve their own problems and are unable to take care of the Far East incident, so although world justice can be upheld, the four northeastern provinces are still left to be brutalized by Japan. However, the Northeast is our territory, and the restoration of lost land still depends on our own efforts. If we cannot unite against foreign enemies, it will be difficult to recover. Yan Huiqing, Gu Weijun, and Guo Taiqi are still in Europe, constantly working diplomatically to recover lost land. However, European and American countries are now focused on their own problems and fear any actions that may involve war. I hope that my countrymen will not hold on to the idea of relying on foreigners and should bury themselves in hard work, otherwise the future will be unthinkable.

Transportation between Nanba and Xuanhan has been restored. Liao's Sixth Route Army is attacking Fengcheng and is currently engaged in fierce fighting. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chongqing) Fan Shaozeng telegraphed on the 20th that after Suicheng was released and occupied, the bandits retreated to Phoenix Mountain, relying on the terrain to resist. Zeng ordered Meng's Brigade to attack Phoenix Pass from Wenjia Liang, attacking the bandits' main position on Phoenix Ridge. Fan's Brigade and Fan Ziliang attacked Phoenix Pass, flanking the bandits on the left, and ordered Liao's Brigade to launch a fierce attack on the bandits' position at Jade Emperor Temple to divide the bandits' forces. From Shen time (3-5 PM) to You time (5-7 PM), there was fierce fighting for eight hours. Fortunately, the officers and soldiers were willing to fight, pushing forward one after another, and finally defeated the bandits occupying the entire line, occupying the positions of Phoenix Ridge, Wangjia Mountain, and Jade Emperor Temple. The bandits fled in disarray towards Pujia Village, Shuanglong Village, Lijia Village, and Tiel Mountain. Our army is temporarily guarding each position, and will continue to suppress the bandits separately tomorrow. (25th Dispatch)</p>

(2) When Sui and Liu retreated, they were extremely panicked. All male and female students in the schools and young men and women, except for a few who escaped, were unable to cross the river. Tens of thousands were killed by the bandits, either openly or secretly, their corpses lying all over the fields, buried in pits everywhere. There were hundreds of bodies of men and women. The old, weak, and poor cried out in hunger and cold, which was unbearable to hear. (3) Young men and women in all villages and towns were forced to serve as vanguards, guerrillas, Red Guards, laundry seamstresses, and other teams. The old, weak, and those who resisted were all killed. Grain and food were all moved away. The disaster was so severe that the villages were reduced to ruins, even worse than when Huang Chao and Zhang Xianzhong rampaged through the country. The former prosperity has now become rubble, and the scene is desolate. It is painful to talk about, and it will be difficult to recover for ten years. (25th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e25">Japan Adjusts Diplomatic Relations (Jian) <a href="#e25" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c25" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">25</a></h3>
<p>Japan's Hirota diplomacy has recently made a special effort to adjust its diplomatic relations with China, the United States, and the Soviet Union. On the one hand, it has strongly advocated its so-called goodwill theory. On the other hand, it has reorganized the internal affairs of its Ministry of Foreign Affairs and replaced its ambassadors abroad in order to temporarily bring the diplomatic relations with its counterparts to a satisfactory state, so that the various previous discords can be transformed from the current state of stagnation due to the revitalization of Japanese diplomacy, in order to escape its isolated situation. In fact, the reason why Japan's diplomacy has formed today's isolated situation is not because of any provocation by the countries along the Pacific coast, but because of the arbitrary actions of Japanese militarists. Japan has already launched the September 18th Incident in Shenyang, occupying our three northeastern provinces, and then advanced to Rehe, coveting North China. Even if our people are unable to fight against it, how can they bow their heads in humiliation and speak of goodwill with it? Therefore, this kind of hostile relationship must have a de facto change, and cannot be transformed by mere empty words and skillful means. The economic competition between the United States and Japan is also due to the competition for the Far Eastern market. Japan wants to monopolize maritime hegemony in the Pacific, so it shows the reality of conflict everywhere. As for the Soviet Union's vigilance against Japan, it is also due to Japan's rapid implementation of its policy of annexing the Chinese Eastern Railway. From this, it can be seen that its replacement of ambassadors and revitalization of diplomacy are all in vain and cannot alleviate the root of its current opposition.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan's reorganization of foreign affairs, in terms of European and Asian diplomacy and relations with the United States, has been re-evaluated one by one. The focus is not so much on reforming Japan's diplomatic relations with the United States, but on rewarding and protecting Japanese immigrants to North and South America, in order to solve its hidden and unaddressed economic panic. The impact of the world economic panic felt by Japan, since it strongly advocated its emergency period, the stimulus of military industry can cover up general weaknesses. But now the world situation does not allow Japan to challenge again and again, and the Japanese warlords dare not blindly risk proclaiming war to the world again. Even against the Soviet Union, it only takes the actual power of the Chinese Eastern Railway without triggering a real war. Therefore, the newly established Research Department, while paying attention to investigating the relations of Asian countries, also pays attention to investigating North and South America, so its intention is very clear.</p>
<p>After Japan successfully invaded the three northeastern provinces, the ease of occupying Jehol was beyond the expectations of the Japanese warlords. So why does it not continue its hard-line policy today? Because until now, it also knows that international relations are too bad and it can no longer claim to be the vanguard of anti-communism to gain the sympathy of the powers. Therefore, military action cannot be temporarily suspended. Moreover, the United States and the Soviet Union have resumed diplomatic relations, and many European countries have concluded non-aggression treaties with the Soviet Union. It is impossible for Japan to use its previous diplomatic skills to obtain actual benefits. What is more, the competition between Britain and Japan in the Far East market and the trade competition in the Indian and South Seas islands have caused unprecedented disputes. Although the Japan-India Conference may be able to obtain a temporary agreement, the fact that Britain and Japan are not coordinated has been clearly seen. Then Japan's so-called diplomacy of reason, so-called Japan-US goodwill, and the solution of the China-Japan problem are all just a kind of diplomatic smoke screen.</p>
<p>Let us try to verify it based on recent facts. First, Japan has recently borrowed the name of suppressing bandits to attack eastern Chahar with the puppet state. Its intention is not only to plot eastern Chahar, but also to be a prelude to the invasion of Inner Mongolia, especially to probe our country's psychology and the attitudes of various countries in order to take the second step. Secondly, as a result of the military adventures of the Japanese warlords in the past two years, it is clear that a Japan-US war will not be realized for a while. The conflict between Britain and Japan has not reached any tension. The greatest possibility that Japan can control the key to launching a war in the Far East and fight it alone is the Soviet Union. Japan wants to maintain its existing victories, so it can only first hold the Chinese Eastern Railway to limit its activities in the Far East. Therefore, it pretends to show goodwill to other countries to ease its hostile behavior, so that it can increase its troops in northern Manchuria and implement all the interests of occupying Manchuria alone. Then Japan's so-called revitalization of diplomacy is to decorate peace in the name of diplomacy, as a preparation for further war.</p>

<p>The President Personally Visits the Scene of the Accident to Offer Condolences</p>
<p>The Number of Fatalities Exceeds Two Hundred</p>
<p>(Paris) After the collision between two express trains in La Garenne last night, rescue workers worked through the night under the light of torches. As of this morning, two hundred bodies have been recovered. It is anticipated that the total number of deaths will be between two hundred and thirty and two hundred and forty. When firefighters and police climbed into the wreckage, the tragic scene was unbearable to witness. Many of the victims were still clutching Christmas food packages. The cries of parents searching for their children and children searching for their mothers were even more heart-wrenching. Due to a shortage of stretchers, the injured were mostly carried on wooden boards and benches to makeshift emergency rooms set up in nearby buildings for immediate treatment. Cargo trucks and private cars were requisitioned to serve as ambulances. Among the dead were two members of parliament who were returning home for Christmas. The engineer of the Paris-Strasbourg express train, Tao Dini, was detained by the authorities this morning for questioning. It was learned that the signals for the preceding train were not faulty. (National Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The special express train between Paris and Strasbourg and the special express train between Paris and Le Raincy collided in La Garenne the day before yesterday. The number of fatalities has now reached one hundred and ninety-five. However, as more than ten of the injured are in critical condition, the total death toll is expected to exceed two hundred. Fifty bodies have not yet been identified. President Lebrun, accompanied by many officials, personally visited the Gare de l'Est this morning to offer condolences to the victims. The last batch of bodies was recovered from under the overturned carriages. Burned flesh and charred wood were mixed together in a horrific sight. Today, the damaged carriages and locomotives have all been cleared and transported to the storage yard at La Garenne station.

Newspapers, which would normally have been suspended from Sunday to Wednesday morning for Christmas, also issued special editions yesterday to report on the incident. "The Daily Mail" said that France has suddenly suffered a tragedy during this Christmas season, and everyone who hears about it expresses their condolences. Christmas is originally a time for human enjoyment, but this unfortunate event has caused hundreds of families to face each other with sorrow. At this time, who would be in the mood to enjoy themselves? The cause of the accident is under investigation. What we can know is that the La Garenne incident was an act of God and could not have been foreseen by humans. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)</p>

<p>(Paris) An editorial in "The Times" discussing the Italian-Austrian issue, mentioning the upcoming visit of Italian Undersecretary of State Suvich to Vienna, states that strengthening Austria's independent status is a new condition indispensable for securing Italy's safety. This is not only the foundation for understanding between Italy and Austria but also the foundation for understanding between Italy and other countries. If other countries have a little reason, they will know that the solidarity of Central European countries, free from German hegemony, is the most necessary thing for maintaining peace. Therefore, all countries and Italy can seek understanding on the position of maintaining Austria's independence. (Havas Telegraph, 24th)</p>

A war between Japan and the United States and Japan and Russia is inevitable. If this war occurs, Manchuria and Mongolia will be devastated. People's hearts are greatly shaken because of this.

<p>Primarily Based on Maintaining Peace</p>
<p>Will Utilize the Enemies of the Enemy Against Japan</p>
<p>Osaka Asahi Shimbun, dated the 19th of this month, reported that the Moscow "Izvestia" published a long article on the 16th by Soviet Russian diplomatic expert Mr. Garlat of the Craig, entitled "The Foundation of Soviet Russian Foreign Policy." The main points of its contents are as follows: Soviet Russian foreign policy is based on maintaining peace. Therefore, it proposes the conclusion of non-aggression treaties. All countries respond to Russia's proposals according to their convenience. However, Japan, with its freedom of will, is unwilling to conclude such a treaty. The world is now divided into two major camps, Europe and the Far East, sharply opposed to each other and preparing for war. However, Soviet Russia will maintain neutrality. However, a certain power fears that the Soviet Union's neutral attitude will be detrimental to it and is gradually beginning to attack the Soviet Union. Therefore, Russia has no choice but to go to war against a certain country. If other powers indicate their willingness to provide assistance to the Soviet Union, Russia will naturally utilize them. If it is believed that the enemy of the enemy is in its interest, it should cooperate with it, regardless of which country it is. However, what kind of purpose or intention the country that indicates its willingness to cooperate with Soviet Russia has is not known to Russia. The above clearly refers to the relationship between the United States, Russia, and Japan, predicting the measures that the Soviet Union should take in the future, that is, if something happens to the Soviet Union, it will utilize the enemy of the enemy to determine its foreign policy to deal with Japan.</p>

<p>Vigorously Rejecting Militarism</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In order to cope with the extraordinary diplomacy of 1935 and 1936, Foreign Minister Hirota is, on the one hand, inheriting the legacy of Uchida's scorched earth diplomacy and newly establishing the American Bureau and the Research Department, and expanding the organization of the Commercial Bureau and the European Bureau. On the other hand, he is convening a meeting of important figures from both Japan and the United States in Tokyo to find a new path for diplomatic relations with the United States. Today, he studied diplomatic strategies toward the United States with Information Minister Amau and former Ambassador to the United States Debuchi. It is reported that Debuchi vigorously rejected militarism, and said that the gap in relations between Japan and the United States is due to the September 18th Incident and the Shanghai War. After the September 18th Incident, the military and political work of intensifying the colonization of Manchuria and Mongolia made the United States believe that Japan is difficult to be a friend. Therefore, the key point of the policy toward the United States is to ease the monopolistic policy of dominating Asia. It is reported that Foreign Minister Hirota also admitted that the advice of former Ambassador Debuchi is reasonable and will carefully consider it. (Hualian Telegraph, 25th)</p>

<p>Decide to Persistently Negotiate with the Government</p>
<p>Military Dictatorship Starts in Manchuria</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army Central Department, regarding the South Manchuria Railway reorganization plan, based on the so-called on-site plan brought to Tokyo on the 18th by First-Class Accountant Hirai, solicited the opinions of relevant generals in the ministry. Also, Major Akimizu, Artillery of the Army Department, who went to Manchuria with Accountant Hirai, will also return to Beijing in a few days. Therefore, the army leadership, including the Army Minister, will listen in detail to the situation in Manchuria from the Major before the end of the year, report on the situation on the ground, and conduct preparatory negotiations with the Ministry of Colonial Affairs and other relevant authorities next spring. Once these negotiations come to an end, the army's plan to reconcile the on-site plan with the Central Department's plan will be established, and formal negotiations will begin. (Dentsu Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) This morning, rumors spread that the Army Central Department had ordered the Kwantung Army to rewrite the South Manchuria Railway reorganization plan. The Army Department stated this afternoon that this news was not accurate, and said that the reorganization plan determined in Changchun had already been agreed to by the vice president of the South Manchuria Railway Company. Although this original plan can be modified, its outline cannot be changed. The military department expressed its intention to adhere to its original intention. However, the three ministries of Colonial Affairs, Finance, and Foreign Affairs have expressed their opposition to fundamental reorganization. The attitude of the president and vice president of the South Manchuria Railway, Hayashi and Hatta, has attracted much attention from all circles. It is said that the real purpose of the military department's reorganization plan is to implement military dictatorship. If the reorganization is successful, the control over important domestic industries will also be taken over by the military department, and dictatorship will be implemented in the mainland. (Hualian Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported on the 18th that regarding the specific plan for the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway, the Kwantung Army and the executives of the South Manchuria Railway have repeatedly met in Changchun. Both parties agree that the economic value of the reorganization of the South Manchuria Railway should remain unchanged in principle. In order to absorb funds and implement the national policy of economy, it will be convenient for substantive and rational management. It is found that the fundamental revision of the on-site plan will maintain the Kwantung Army's original plan regarding the joint operation of coal mines and railways by holding companies, with each being an independent company. As for the local departments of the attached land that are responsible for local administration, extraterritoriality will be abolished. At an appropriate time, "Manchukuo" will inherit the administrative facilities of the attached land. The name of the holding company will be changed to Manchuria Industrial Development Company. Before the industrial and economic control of the entire Manchuria, the name of the military commander will not be used for the supervision of the canning industry. Under the supervision of the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, one-dimensional supervision rights will be granted, or a governor will be appointed to control it. This development company is the highest control and supervision agency of the empire in Manchuria, and also the advisory agency of the highest agency of the empire in Manchuria, so that the economic policies of Japan and Manchuria, regardless of reality and form, can be completely consistent. The company has the power to decide on important economic policies in Manchuria. Its main staff members will be appointed by the highest representatives of the Japanese and Manchurian empires stationed in Manchuria: the commander of the Kwantung Army, or the chief of staff, the president of the South Manchuria Railway, the director of the General Affairs Department of "Manchukuo", the director-general of the Industry Department, and the director-general of the Transportation Department will be members to form the Japan-Manchuria Economic Committee.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Tonight, Minister of Commerce Nakajima hosted a banquet at Momijitei for the leaders of the Seiyukai and Minseito parties to discuss cooperation between the two parties. It is said that the steps within the Seiyukai are still not consistent. Many members advocate monopolizing the key positions of the House of Representatives and excluding the Minseito party.

<p>Barcelona, Spain: Colonel Masia, President of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, was one of the leaders of the Spanish Revolution. He recently underwent emergency surgery for acute appendicitis, but due to his advanced age, it was difficult to sustain him. He suddenly collapsed early this morning. After a blood transfusion, his physical condition improved slightly. All members of the provincial government were at his side. Mr. Masia was seriously ill, but his spirit was still clear. He still did not forget the country and called out, "If the province of Catalonia does not unite, there is no hope for the future." The doctor comforted him not to be afraid, and he replied, "I have never been afraid in my life." Then he pointed to the nine doctors next to him and said, "I am afraid that there are too many of you." Then he talked with his wife for a long time and finally told his daughter, "Everything in the province of Catalonia is hopeless." At six o'clock, Mr. Masia's energy was exhausted, and he gradually entered a state of dying. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)</p>
<p>Madrid: Colonel Masia, President of the Autonomous Government of Catalonia, died at 10:55 am this morning. His family and dignitaries were present at his deathbed. The poet Gassal, a lifelong friend and collaborator of Masia, also personally said goodbye. The members of the Catalan Provincial Government immediately convened a meeting at Masia's residence. As soon as the bad news spread, a large number of men and women gathered in front of Masia's residence and the Provincial Government to express their condolences. All members of the Catalan Provincial Government extended their condolences to the family of the late President. (Havas Telegraph, 25th)</p>

<p>Capital of Uruguay: The Pan-American Conference will close on Tuesday afternoon. It was decided to invite the commissioners of the League of Nations to deal with the Chaco dispute to attend the last meeting of the Investigation Group. The Pan-American Conference decided that the League of Nations Investigation Committee would consult with Bolivia and Paraguay to find a solution and provide assistance. The diplomatic policies of the countries participating in the Pan-American Conference will not be affected by this. No one doubts that the League of Nations Investigation Committee will succeed, but people generally believe that the committee will have to go through serious difficulties to establish an arbitration agreement acceptable to both parties. In addition, the French representative at the Pan-American Conference put forward a draft multilateral treaty stipulating that the signatory countries should treat each other preferentially and not give most-favored-nation treatment to countries outside the treaty. There were many opponents of this case, especially Mexico and Argentina. It was called the "Ottawa Agreement of the Americas." After being revised and reducing its righteousness, it was passed on the condition that it be studied in the future. (Havas Telegraph, 24th)</p>

<p>Stabilizing the Turmoil of the Political Situation</p>
<p>And Completing the Communist Suppression Work</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held its memorial week on the morning of the 25th. Ju Zheng, Yu Youren, Chen Shaokuan, Li Yuanding, Lin Xiang, Lu Qu, Wei Huai, and more than 400 National Government officials attended. Chairman Lin led the ceremony. Ju Zheng gave a report entitled Stabilizing the Turmoil of the Political Situation and Actively Completing the Bandit Suppression Work. The original words are as follows: Today, brothers want to report on two points. One is to stabilize the turmoil of the political situation, and the other is to actively complete the bandit suppression work. Regarding the first point, the central government has always used the four words "sincerity and unity" to hope that all comrades in the party who bear important military and political responsibilities will give up their prejudices and support the central government in overcoming the current difficulties together. Therefore, on the one hand, it is striving for the stability of the political situation, opening up a way out, and giving the country an opportunity to gradually implement all construction plans. Because the Chinese political situation is often in turmoil, just like the ripples caused by throwing a stone into a pool of clear water, there is a limit. If stones are constantly thrown down, the pool water will be in a long-term state of turmoil. The current Chinese political situation is like the pool water that has been thrown stones into. There are many people throwing stones, and the turmoil of the political situation is even worse. Therefore, the greatest obstacle to China's political reform is in this state of throwing stones. It is even more obstructed. We can imagine that any ideal of political reform must take unity and stability as its premise for implementation. Otherwise, all the nice-sounding political terms will be empty talk. In recent years, the government's painstaking efforts to seek unity and stability have been based on this principle. However, the facts obtained are very contrary. If it is said that Chinese politics is truly in a state of unity and stability, then even if there are many different doctrines and political parties opposed to each other, such as the current situation in Britain and the United States, it can also constrain and summarize all political struggles within the scope of the law, and build a country that is more perfect than China is at present. This is very obvious. But does China's current situation have these conditions? Can all the doctrines of Europe and the United States be moved out for political struggle? If not, then we must first create a situation of unity and stability for political transformation. This is the consistent position of the central government. But how can we achieve unity and security? This depends on whether the comrades in the party who are responsible for the military and political affairs can attach importance to the party's doctrine and believe that the wrong idea of harming the nation by throwing stones is wrong. Otherwise, the future turmoil of the Chinese political situation will only have a hopeless future and will inevitably cause the entire nation to perish together. Therefore, at this time, the central government can only seek perfection and hope that the comrades in the party will be tolerant and support the central government so that the turmoil can move toward stability. Regarding the second point, actively completing the bandit suppression work is the fact that the government has been working with all its strength in recent years. The scourge of the Communist bandits in China lies not in their own rampant power, but in the fact that our government and comrades are not properly suppressed. We must actively use the political line and goals of the Three People's Principles to eliminate that group of bandits who have long been ignorant of what politics is. The past work of suppressing the Communists has achieved good results, and the generals who suppressed the Communists have long put forward the proposition of 30% military and 70% politics. This is truly saying that the struggle between nationalism and anti-nationalism is, in other words, not only a military struggle, but also a political struggle. Therefore, to complete the fundamental task of suppressing the bandits, the struggle in military and politics must be attached to a supreme rule at the same time. At the same time, as an aspect of the political struggle, such as the bloody battles of the armed forces in the front, it should be carried out with the slogan of 30% military and 70% politics. Then, the cultural contention in the rear should also be carried out with the slogan of 30% thought and 70% politics. The reason is that communism is spreading in China, and only by eradicating this ideological poison can we eradicate it. But we can also know that the communist scourge in China is manifested in ideology on the one hand, and in action on the other hand. Only the struggle of action can eradicate this poison of action. We must assume the responsibility of suppressing the bandits with this point of view, so that the military and political work will not fail. Only in this way can we have the hope of unity and stability. The armed comrades in the front and the long-shirt comrades in the rear, the national crisis is imminent, and everyone should work hard to complete this work to save the last fate of this country and nation.

<p>(Nanjing) The Jin Shuren case is being investigated by the High Court according to law. Ma Bufang, the commander of the Ninth Division, interceded with Chairman Jiang and President Wang when he came to Beijing last time. After returning to the defense, he also joined Deng Baoshan and the representatives of the three provinces of Min, Gan, Qing, and Ning to present a request to the central government to temporarily release Jin on bail. The government is considering it. The most forceful opponent of Jin Shuren, Chan Hui Aisha, was originally a student in Soviet Russia. Because he was familiar with the situation in Russia, he was appointed by Jin as the Russian translator of the provincial government. Later, he was dismissed and wanted by the new government for a certain case. Ai came to Beijing and audited at the China University. At that time, the General Staff Headquarters happened to think that the new thing was urgent. Aisha offered his services and claimed to work in the headquarters. He also went to Xinjiang with Huang Musong once. Now, the Hui people of the three provinces of Gan, Qing, and Ning deny that Ai is a representative stationed in Beijing, so he has gone elsewhere.

<p>Requests the Central Government to Provide Favorable Resettlement for Sun Dianying's Troops</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Liang Hejun, Director of the Finance Department of Ningxia Province, arrived in Beijing on the 25th from Ningxia at the invitation of Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi. He visited President Wang Jingwei and reported on the recent administrative situation in the province. He said that since Ningxia became a province, the administrative situation has improved. The stationed troops in the province do not interfere in politics, which is rare in other provinces. On the revenue side, there has been a gradual increase. The annual tax revenue of the entire province is about 3.5 million yuan, with fur accounting for more than 60-70%. Payment of military and government expenses is still slightly surplus. Ma Hongkui's 15th Route Army receives an additional 80,000 yuan per month from the Central Government, so it feels more stable. Although agricultural crops have been abundant in recent years, prices are too low, so the entire province's rural areas are showing signs of bankruptcy. Sun Dianying's troops from the Central Government entered Qinghai to reclaim land. After arriving in the area from Qinghai to Suiyuan, the people of Qinghai could not bear the burden and protested, requesting the Central Government to withdraw the order. The discipline of Sun's troops is still good. Currently, Suiyuan is below zero degrees Celsius, and Sun's army does not take a single blade of grass or tree from the people. This time I came to Beijing, in addition to reporting to the Central Government, I also ask the Central Government to pay attention to Sun's troops and give them favorable resettlement.

<p>Qu Shounian and Zhao Yijian Have Come to the Province One After Another</p>
<p>Cai Tingkai Will Be Able to Return to the Province in About Ten Days</p>
<p>A visitor from Fuzhou talked about the situation between Fujian and Zhejiang. The recent situation has become more peaceful. In the northern part of Fujian, the 19th Route Army has not advanced towards Jianou. The Central Government troops under Liu Heding in Jianou have not taken any military action. In the eastern part of Fujian, the 19th Route Army is still holding Lianjiang, Fuqing, and the area east of Luoyuan, which is still the defense area of the Marine Corps. Qiu Zhaochen's vanguard commander has not set a date to depart. However, the troops of the Third Army have recently been coming to the provincial capital from the Tian area. Commander Qu Shounian also arrived in the province on the 18th. It is rumored that the army is concentrated in Yanping and moving towards Jianou, which is not true. According to Qu, he will stay in the province temporarily, waiting for orders to go to the front. Based on this situation, military developments still need to wait until Cai Tingkai returns to the province. Zhao Yijian, the newly appointed commander of the Fifth Division, arrived in Fuzhou yesterday from Xiamen. Zhao will go to Yan from the province, so there is news that military operations can be developed at the front after Zhao arrives. Cai Tingkai's current inspection of the army started in Xinghua, then Quanzhou, then Zhangzhou, and then Longyan. It is said that they are all related to the troop deployment issue. It is said that Cai's return to the province will be within this month. At that time, the military situation in Fujian may break this stagnant atmosphere. (December 12, 21)</p>

<p>——Chiang Kai-shek Orders Various Units to Pursue and Suppress the Communists in Fujian——</p>
<p>A Nanchang dispatch reports that since the Fujian Incident, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has been actively suppressing the pseudo 1357 Army Corps gathered on the border between Jiangxi and Fujian, without any relaxation, in order to break the cooperation between the bandits and the Fujian side. The bandits in Zixi and Lichuan have already been defeated and retreated into Fujian. The focus of the bandit suppression has shifted from eastern Jiangxi to northern Fujian. Recently, Chiang Kai-shek personally went to the front line to command and supervise the troops to closely pursue the bandits in northern Fujian. Various units captured Guangze on the 11th. Except for a small part of the pseudo 7th Army Corps retreating to Guangchang, a large part of it fled into the area of Tai Ning and Shunchang in Fujian. After the North Road Army recovered Guangze, the Guande Pass was under control. In Jiangxi, the intrusion of the Red Army can be prevented, and in Fujian, it can stand together with the Central Army of Chong'an and Shaowu, and cooperate with various units on the Zhejiang border. If the Fujian army invades Zhejiang, the Central Army can cut off its rear. Moreover, the terrain of Fujian is high in the west and low in the east, and the Central Army can attack the back of the Fujian army. Therefore, the Fuzhou Camp has been moved to to facilitate command. (December 20)</p>

<p>19th Route Army Air Force Mobilizes Northward</p>
<p>A Significant Number of Red Bandits Secretly Arrive in Changting and Liancheng</p>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: Following the Fujian Incident, the Guangdong side actively consolidated its border defenses. Currently, the forwardmost patrols of the Guangdong army along the Guangdong-Fujian border have crossed into Fujian. They can reach Zhangzhou and Longyan within 24 hours. The entire 19th Route Army is moving towards Fuzhou and northern Fujian. In the Xingquan area, there are only some newly formed militia units under Weng Zhaoyuan. Zhangzhou also only has the 49th Division under Zhang Yan, at most no more than three regiments. The Guangdong army patrols along the Zhao'an road every night, with patrols only a little over ten li from the county seat. It is said that He Shijun, the Magistrate of Zhao'an County, went to Macau for medical treatment last month. The Fujian Provincial Government then appointed Yang Shaokai as the new Magistrate, but Yang has not yet taken office. With no one in charge of county affairs, the county soldiers and militia suddenly mutinied due to some suspicion. Personnel from the county government and various agencies completely scattered and fled. This occurred on the 13th of this month. It is also said that the County Magistrate was newly replaced. With the old Magistrate gone, local order is also quite chaotic. The Guangdong-Fujian border benefits from convenient road transportation, with a round trip from Shantou to Zhao'an possible in one day. Deep villages in Guangdong, such as Huanggang south of Fenshuiguan and 20 li along the road on both sides of the villages, all have troops stationed. These are all situations on the Guangdong-Fujian border.</p>
<p>In the Changting and Liancheng areas of western Fujian, a large number of bandits and communists have recently arrived from the Jiangxi border. These bandits are also afraid of aircraft reconnaissance and often move out at dusk, returning to camp by noon the next day. As soon as they set up camp, they guard the road intersections, cutting off transportation. Each leg of the bandits' journey is 150 li, and they travel light, eating only fried rice along the way and not cooking meals. It is said that a large contingent of communist bandits has also arrived in the Yunmenling and Huichang areas. Their journeys can be calculated at 150 li per leg, suspected of coming from Shicheng and Ruijin. The bandits do not use military telephones for their movements. They establish a communication and intelligence network every five square li. In the event of military action, this network is distributed to various areas, using the method of running on foot to transmit information between A, B, C, and D. News from Liancheng can be sent to Ruijin within a few hours. It is said that the direction of the bandits is moving towards the Jiangxi-Fujian border. This intelligence network is also set up in various bandit areas and at the border between red and white areas. The garrisons in the various counties of southern Fujian are weak, and the people's self-defense capabilities are low. The prospects for public safety are extremely worrying, which is also a negative phenomenon following the Fujian Incident.</p>
<h3 id="e102">The Course of Resolving the Mongolian Autonomy Issue <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Mongolian People's Demands Were Too High; The Central Government Set a Compromise</p>
<p>Principles and Organizational Laws Can Be Implemented After Approval</p>
<p>Chiefs of Leagues and Banners in Inner Mongolia requested the organization of an Inner Mongolian Autonomous Government. Deliberations began on October 9 and continued until November 11. The Minister of Internal Affairs Huang Shaojun and Vice Chairman of the Mongolian Committee Zhao Pilian went to Bailingmiao to consult with various princes several times. They combined the central government's decided plan with the Mongolian people's demands to formulate six principles. Minister Huang has now submitted these to the central government for a final decision. Based on the account of someone who participated in the meeting, the following details the before and after of this matter, the central government's original plan, the Mongolian people's initial demands, the finally drafted principles, and the organizational outline of the Mongolian League and Banner Chiefs' Autonomous Conference for the reference of those concerned about border affairs.</p>
<p>Meeting Process: The Inner Mongolian League and Banner Chiefs' Preparatory Conference for Autonomy held five meetings from October 9 to October 24 of this year. The first was on October 9, the second on October 15, the third on October 19, the fourth on October 22, and the fifth on the 24th of this month. As a result, 36 articles of the Organization Law of the Mongolian Autonomous Agency were passed. When Minister Huang and Vice Chairman Zhao arrived in Bailingmiao on November 11, the first three days were purely for banquets, horse racing, and chanting scriptures. From the 14th to the 17th, Minister Huang formally consulted with the Mongolian princes on the issue of Mongolian autonomy. At that time, the demands of the Mongolian people and the central government's plan differed greatly, making it impossible to reach an agreement. Therefore, on the morning of the 17th, it almost broke down. Minister Huang and others planned to return to Sui immediately. Later, through the mediation of the Panchen Lama and a group of young people, the final six principles were decided until 2 a.m. on the 18th. On the 18th, Minister Huang and others happily returned to Sui.</p>
<p>Central Government Plan: Plan A formulated by the central government changes the organization of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission: (1) The central government will establish a Border Affairs Department (or Mongolian and Tibetan Department) directly under the Executive Yuan as the highest central authority for handling Mongolian and Tibetan administration. It will have one Minister and two Vice Ministers to oversee the department's affairs. (2) The Border Affairs Department will establish various divisions and sections to manage affairs and various committees to be responsible for discussion and implementation. (3) The Border Affairs Department shall determine appropriate times to separately convene leaders with administrative responsibilities and individuals with virtue and prestige from various border regions to hold meetings in Beijing. (4) The Border Affairs Department shall consult with other departments and committees on matters of national administration that are mutually related and decide on how to proceed. B. A plan to reform the Mongolian local administrative system: (1) The administrative regions where provinces and counties have already been established shall not be changed. (2) Provinces with Mongolian people residing in them shall establish Mongolian Local Political Affairs Committees separately as special management agencies within those provinces to handle local administration. Each committee shall have a number of members and elect a Chairman and a Vice Chairman, all of whom shall be filled by Mongolians with virtue, prestige, political knowledge, and experience. (3) In provinces where ten local political affairs committees have already been established, except for military, diplomatic, and other national administrative matters, which shall still be handled by the central government or by the local provincial government authorized by the central government, the remaining local administration of areas where Mongolian people reside shall be the responsibility of the Mongolian Local Political Affairs Committee and shall be under the command and supervision of the Central Border Affairs Department. (4) The Mongolian Local Political Affairs Committee may, depending on the situation, divide into departments or sections to handle various administrative affairs. (5) The Mongolian Local Political Affairs Committee may, when necessary, allocate funds from the central government to subsidize various local construction projects according to the needs of each locality. (6) The Mongolian Local Political Affairs Committee may formulate local special regulations and issue orders within the scope of not violating national laws and regulations. (7) The Mongolian Local Political Affairs Committee shall also establish a Mongolian People's Representative Conference as a civil agency of the Mongolian people, which shall meet regularly once a year. The representatives shall be generated by leagues, banners, and groups as units and may use the election method. (8) The various departments and counties under the provincial government shall consult with the local political affairs committee at any time to decide on the local political affairs involving the scope of Mongolian administration, which shall be resolved by the provincial government committee or submitted to the central government for resolution. (9) The Chairman and Vice Chairman of the Mongolian Local Government Committee may attend meetings of the local provincial government committee as non-voting participants. (10) The table of Mongolian administrative system is as follows:</p>
<p>Departments and Committees: Various Departments</p>
<p>Administrative Pivot: Provincial Government</p>
<p>Border Affairs Department: Mongolian Local Political Affairs Committee</p>
<p>C. Standards for Employing Personnel in Mongolian Administration: (1) Central or local Mongolian administration should accommodate as many Mongolians as possible. (2) The central government should establish branches of the Central Military and Political School in appropriate locations, staffed by those familiar with the Mongolian situation as instructors, to cultivate Mongolian national talent in various specialties and find ways to employ them. A concrete plan to reform the Mongolian administrative system is explained in the following: According to the fourth article of the Premier's Outline of Nation-Building, the government should support the small and weak ethnic groups within the country to enable them to decide on their own affairs and achieve autonomy. The Premier solemnly declared that he recognized the right of self-determination of all ethnic groups within China. After the victory of the revolution against imperialism and warlords, a free and unified Republic of China would be organized. The Third National Congress also resolved that we must correct the evil policies of fooling Mongolia and Tibet during the Qing and warlord eras and sincerely support the economic, political, and educational development of all ethnic groups, striving to advance together towards the realm of civilization and progress. The party advocates supporting the autonomy of various ethnic groups within the country, which has long been announced to China and abroad. In order to eliminate misunderstandings among border residents and increase their interests, all Mongolian and Tibetan administrative systems, whether central or local, should be based on this spirit of self-determination and autonomy to achieve the practical results of support and development. Taking Mongolia as an example, the connection between the central organization and the Mongolian local organization in the past was loose, and the customs of the Mongolian people were different. Within the provincial region, because there was no special management agency, it was easy for misunderstandings to occur in the provincial administration, which gave those who coveted the opportunity to sow discord. On the one hand, the princes and chiefs who bear the heavy responsibility of the clan, as well as the young Mongolians who have received political training, have not been able to find political outlets, which often disappoints them. The outbreak of Inner Mongolian autonomy this time, although the cause is complex, is mainly due to the fact that the system and politics cannot fully satisfy the demands of the Mongolian people. Based on the above reasons, a concrete plan to reform the Mongolian local administrative system is proposed, and its main points are explained as follows: First, reform the Mongolian local system, with the principle of not destroying its original administrative regions and administrative system for places where provinces and counties have already been established. The establishment of provinces in the border areas is based on special regions, and the original administrative regions have long been clearly defined with the terms of a certain province and a certain county. Public and private documents have been used for a long time. The twenty-eight provinces of China are especially well-known to people in China and abroad. If they are suddenly divided, the relationship will not be superficial. Therefore, this plan advocates that the administrative regions of provinces such as Chahar and Suiyuan should not be changed due to the Mongolian people's advocacy of autonomy. As for the local administrative organization, it may be slightly supplemented to suit the actual needs. Second, although provinces have been established in places where Mongolian people gather, because of different customs, habits, languages, and religions, the past local governments have often neglected the study and reform of the Mongolian people's internal affairs, resulting in various estrangements. This is undeniable. Now, in order to remedy the defects, it is proposed to add a local political affairs committee under the provincial administrative region and the provincial administrative system, under the command and supervision of the Border Affairs Department, to specifically manage Mongolian local administration, to assist the provincial government, and to achieve the effect of separate governance. This will not only make Mongolian administration specialized, but also make the relationship between the central government and the border areas closer. Third, in order to increase the actual interests of the border people, the central government must plan and proceed with various construction projects, both material and spiritual, step by step. However, the local public and private economies are exhausted. When necessary, the Border Affairs Department should consider the needs of each locality and formulate construction plans and budgets, which should be submitted to the central government for the allocation of large amounts of money to assist, in order to appease the border people and consolidate the border defense. Fourth, various ethnic disputes occur frequently in various localities. The provincial government presides over the political affairs of the entire province and originally had a quota of Mongolian members. In the event of disputes between various departments and counties and the people, the provincial government committee can be responsible for resolving them. If necessary, the central government should be asked to handle them for the sake of convenience.</p>
<p>Mongolian People's Demands: Organization Law of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Government. The chiefs of the Inner Mongolian leagues and banners, in order to meet the actual needs of Inner Mongolia, should invoke the provisions of the Outline of Nation-Building of the National Government on self-determination and autonomy of various ethnic groups within the country, convene a plenary meeting of the chiefs of the Inner Mongolian leagues and banners, and establish the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Government under the leadership of the National Government, and formulate the Organization Law of the Inner Mongolian Autonomous Government, which is promulgated as follows: Chapter I, Autonomous Government.

<p>Through Ups and Downs: After the five princes proposed the organizational methods of the autonomous government, Minister Huang believed that their demands were too extravagant and seemed to have a tendency to break away from the central government. After repeatedly explaining the central government's intentions and the central government's original plan, the chiefs of the leagues and banners gathered to discuss the central government's plan in detail and agreed on eleven articles, expressing a step back. However, Minister Huang still believed that it was not in line with the central government's intention to guide Mongolian autonomy, and he further instructed them on the close relationship between Han and Mongolian, and the interests and harms involved. The princes then discussed again and decided on six principles.</p>
<p>Final Principles: The six principles finally decided on the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy: (1) Name: It shall be named the First Autonomous Region Government of Mongolia, the Second Autonomous Region Government of Mongolia, and so on. (2) Region: The Silingol League and the Chahar Banner shall be compiled into the First Autonomous Region of Mongolia, and the Yiwu and Yi leagues and the Tumote Alashan and Ejina leagues shall be compiled into the Second Autonomous Region of Mongolia. Other leagues and banners shall be compiled according to the ratio. (3) Subordination: The Mongolian autonomous region governments shall be directly under the Executive Yuan. In the event of incidents involving provinces, they shall be handled in consultation with the provincial government. (4) Powers: The Mongolian autonomous region governments shall manage all political affairs of the leagues and banners within their respective regions. (5) Funding: The expenses of the Mongolian autonomous governments shall be allocated by the central government on a monthly basis. (6) Liaison: A joint conference shall be established between the Mongolian autonomous halls, organized by one representative from each banner in each autonomous region, to discuss and decide on common matters between the autonomous regions.</p>
<p>Autonomous Conference: The organizational outline of the Inner Mongolian League and Banner Chiefs' Autonomous Conference. Article 1, In order to realize Inner Mongolian autonomy, the Inner Mongolian League and Banner Chiefs shall convene an Inner Mongolian Autonomous Conference in Bailingmiao.

<p>Connecting Eastern Zhejiang, and Reaching Jinhua, Quzhou, Yan Prefecture, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Taizhou, Wenzhou, and Chu Prefecture</p>
<p>Many Scenic Spots Along Each Prefecture, Future Tourists Will Surely Be Numerous</p>
<p>The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has been fully completed and is scheduled to open on the 28th. Afterwards, not only will Zhejiang Province be connected, and culture and economy develop evenly, but the province's prosperity plan will also be gradually realized.</p>
<p>According to the planned Hangzhou-Jiangshan route, it was originally a section of the Southeast Railway system personally designated by Sun Yat-sen. In the future, with extensions, one end can pass through the Eastern Great Port, and the other end can extend to Nanchang, connecting to the Nanxun Railway, and then to Pingxiang, connecting with the Yuehan Railway, and can directly reach Guangzhou. It is heard that the authorities' plan to prosper Zhejiang Province takes Hangzhou as the hub for commodity exports, and Zhapu, the Eastern Great Port, as the main center for attracting foreign investment. Therefore, the construction of highways is based on this principle. Many highways in the upper reaches of the Qiantang River are connected to the stations along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway. Moreover, due to the completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, transportation is convenient to the famous scenic spots in various places of the Upper Yangtze, and the number of tourists will increase. The benefit to future prosperity is as expected. The reporter will now describe the authorities' prosperity plan and the relationship between the completion of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and prosperity, in the following, which should be welcome news to those who care about the construction of Zhejiang Province.</p>
<p>The Plan to Prosper the Whole Province: Creating an Oriental Switzerland. The Provincial Highway Bureau believes that Zhejiang Province has many scenic spots. If transportation can be improved and tourists attracted, the number of visitors will increase, and revenue will increase daily. This will directly benefit people's livelihoods and indirectly regulate finance. Therefore, a plan was drafted and submitted to the department for review. The preliminary plan is: (1) To construct branch roads, rest pavilions, etc., in the scenic spots and historical sites near the completed highways within the possible scope. (2) To preserve historical sites. (3) To set up telephones, bathhouses, sports fields, and gasoline emergency relief stations in various scenic areas. The second step of the plan is to establish a tourist visiting agency, divided into six sections. Those who can fluently speak several foreign languages ​​will be assigned to the guiding section. Those who are familiar with the characteristics of various scenic spots and have thoroughly studied the province's history will be assigned to the publicity section. The trust, security, relief, and general road sections are all related to the safety and convenience of travelers. If it can be implemented according to the plan, Zhejiang Province becoming an Oriental Switzerland is as expected. The construction of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is actually the hub for the connection of various highways.</p>
<p>Completion of Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Connects Transportation in Eastern Zhejiang. Now that the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has been completed, the Construction Department is proceeding with the construction of the Xingqun Qiantang River Iron Bridge, and has agreed with the Ministry of Railways to connect the Hangzhou-Ningbo section of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. In the future, Hangzhou can directly reach Ningbo and transfer to the Yin-Feng Highway, Yin-Zhen-Ci Road, Fengxin Road, Xin-Tian-Lin Road (Xinchang from Tiantai to Lin'an), and the stations along the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway are mostly connected to various highways, such as Hangzhou-Shaoxing Road (Hangzhou to Shaoxing), Pu-Zhong Road (Pujiang to Zhengjiachang), Yi-Chang Road (Yiwu via Dongyang to Changle Town, Sheng County), Jin-Yong-Wu Road (Jinhua to Yongkang and Wuyi), Yong-Jin Road (Yongkang to Jinyun), Jin-Man Road (Jinyun to Suichang), Li-Qing Road (Lishui to Qingtian), Qing-Wen Road (Qingtian to Yongjia), Yong-Rui-Ping Road (Yongjia via Rui'an to the Fujian border), Long-Sui-Chang Road (Longyou via Suichang to Songyang), Lan-Shou Road (Lanxi to Shouchang), Tun-Jian-Shou Road (Jiande to the Anhui border and Luotongbu to Shouchang), Chun-Sui Road (Chunan to Suian), Jiang-Chang-Kai Road (Jiangshan, Changshan, Kaihua), Sui-Kai Road (Suian to Kaihua), Qu-Guang Road (Quzhou to Guangfeng), etc., are all interconnected. Therefore, although the route only passes through the counties of Shaoxing, Jinhua, and Quzhou old prefectures, it actually connects the old prefectures of Eastern Zhejiang, Jinhua, Quzhou, Yan Prefecture, Ningbo, Shaoxing, Taizhou, Wenzhou, and Chu Prefecture, all interconnected and accessible. The completion of this road and its relation to the future prosperity of Zhejiang Province can be seen from this. Hangzhou's transportation in western Zhejiang is known to be developed, including the Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway, the Hangzhou-Hui Highway, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, the Hangzhou-Fuyang Road (Hangzhou to Fuyang), the Fu-Xin Road (Fuyang to Tonglu), the Tong-Jian Road (Tonglu to Jiande). The Beijing-Hangzhou National Highway has a branch road to Mogan Mountain, and the Hangzhou-Hui Highway passes through Tianmu Mountain in Yuqian, both of which are scenic areas. Zhapu is the location of the Eastern Great Port personally designated by Sun Yat-sen. Since the construction of the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway, foreigners flock there during the summer to swim and escape the heat, and land prices have soared. If it can be actively promoted, Zhapu will become a prosperous area.</p>
<p>Mountains Meander into Zhejiang, Many Scenic Spots Along the Route. Zhejiang Province's mountains belong to the Nanling Mountain system. The Xianxia Ridge stretches along the Zhejiang-Fujian border, and the Huaiyu Mountain stands on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi border. From here, it meanders into Zhejiang, forming the Kuocang, Dapen, Tiantai, Kuaiji, and Fengling mountain ranges. Therefore, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road east of Zhuji has undulating hills and forms strange peaks and beautiful scenery. The scenic spots near the stations along the route are the Tingxiang Lake, Yue Wang City, Yijian Pavilion, and Xiandang Mountain at Xiaoshan Station; the Zilu Village, Jia Cliff, and Wuxie at Zhuji Station; Shengyan, Zhugongyan, and Baiyun Cave at Yiwu; the North Mountain and Fangyan at Jinhua Station; the Fuzhen Temple and Dongfeng Pavilion at Lanxi Station; the Jiufeng Mountain at Dongyuan Tangxi Station; the Sandie Mountain at Huzhen Station; Xiaonanmei (also known as Tongdadian) and Zhaoqing Temple at Longyuan Station; Longshan Temple at Hecun Station; Sanpian Stone at Jiangshan Station; Huaiyu Mountain at Yushan Station; Wuan Mountain Heling Temple. Among them, the most praised by tourists are Wuxie North Mountain, Fangyan, and Xianxia Ridge. The height of the Donglongtan waterfall in Wuxie is equal to the height of the hidden pool in Xuesai. The North Mountain has Chaozhen Water Jug, Shuanglong and other caves. Fangyan is in Yongkang, 200 zhang high, and the Hugong Temple is located there. The surrounding mountains have many caves of different sizes. Xianxia Ridge is eighty or ninety li away from Jiangshan, and can be reached by car. It is known for its majestic grandeur.</p>

<p>A Ningbo teenager, surnamed Dai, aged 25, arrived in Suzhou from Jiaxing on the 23rd and stayed at No. 75 Dongwu Hotel. On the 24th, he took a carriage to Tiger Hill for sightseeing and returned. Suddenly, he secretly took Lysol solution to commit suicide. He was sent to Su Yong Hospital, but his breath was faint. According to the doctor, there was little hope of saving his life. He left a distorted poem with a slight hint of pessimism. However, the cause and origin were not mentioned. On the Dongwu Hotel guest book, only the surname Dai was registered without a first name. Therefore, it is difficult to find his family.</p>

Afterwards, Fang had a vegetarian meal at Guangfu Temple and did not return to the hotel until dusk. He is scheduled to leave Wuxi for Shanghai today.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Wage Disputes After the Closure of Two Silk Factories <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Due to the extreme decline of the silk market, various silk factories in Wuxi have successively closed down. Workers have repeatedly filed disputes over wages, which are heard almost daily. The turbulent situations of the Taixin and Qingfeng factories are recorded below. (1) Qingfeng Silk Factory outside the South Gate of Jiacheng owed more than 7,000 yuan in wages after its closure. The factory owner and manager, Mr. Yao Juncheng, hid in Shanghai. Factory employees Shen Guoying, Yan Zichen, and Hui Jizhi went to Shanghai to search for him. Unexpectedly, Yao had abandoned his luggage and fled. Shen and others had no choice but to return to Wuxi. Because Yao was a wealthy merchant in Changzhou, with enough property to cover the factory's owed wages, they specially sent a letter to the Wujin Chamber of Commerce yesterday, urging Yao to come to Wuxi to handle the matter. (2) Taixin Silk Factory in Zhoushanbang ceased operations after the warehouse was burned down on the 24th of last month, using this as an excuse. The staff in the factory lived by mortgaging their belongings. Now there is nothing left to pawn. The wages owed have also been defaulted repeatedly. Manager Xu Junjie is hiding near Yong'an Bridge. Yesterday, more than 40 male and female workers went to surround him, demanding wages. Xu had no way to respond, so he jumped over the wall and fled. The workers waited for a long time in vain, so they obtained several dou of white rice from his family to satisfy their hunger. They will continue to sit and demand payment in the future.</p>

<p>Shen Jiang, the county magistrate of Chongming, has been transferred from Dongtai County to Chongming for more than two years. He has been indifferent to local affairs, and local people have long been dissatisfied. Recently, due to ineffective disaster relief and the withholding of 5,000 yuan allocated by the province for disaster relief for twenty years, as well as the red pill manufacturing case in Xixiang, the situation has become even more uproar. Local residents Wang Zenglu, Qu Jiyang, Cheng Qixia, and Huang Jinping separately filed accusations with the province. The disaster victims also reported to the Jiangsu, Chuan, Nan, Chong, Bao, and Qi Five-County Flood Relief Association that County Magistrate Shen was ineffective in disaster relief. The Shanghai gentry Lu Caifu and Wang Qingmu also filed an impeachment with the Flood Relief Association, which has already forwarded it to the provincial government for investigation and punishment. The day before yesterday, Wang Qingmu submitted a separate petition to the province, accusing County Magistrate Shen of withholding disaster relief funds and requesting his removal.</p>

Zhou Mingfu's house in Xiaqin Village was also visited by more than 10 bandits at about 1 o'clock the night before last. They jumped over the wall and entered, overturning boxes and chests and searching everywhere. They tied up the owner and extorted money. Fortunately, the family members were alert and went out to beat the gong and call for help. The bandits fled with the loot.</p>

<p>Zhang Wenhua, a carpenter living at No. 26 Xiaolu North, Xiatang Street, Jiaxing, is 32 years old. Now that he is unemployed and has no way to make a living, he came up with a fantastic idea to use sulfur and other materials, mixed with bowl shards, lard, and fish meat, to make granules. He would throw them on the ground in the countryside so that wild cats and other animals would eat them and be blown to death, and then he would skin them and sell the skins for money. At noon on the 24th, Zhang was again preparing in the house as usual. Due to careless smoking, the sulfur caught fire and exploded, making a loud noise and causing smoke and mist to fill the air. Nearby residents were quite frightened. Zhang Mingsu, who lived with him, was injured in the explosion. The first police station arrested Zhang and sent him to the Public Security Bureau on charges of endangering public safety. On the 25th, he was transferred to the court for interrogation.</p>

<p>Dear Editor, I recently read the Nanjing dispatch on page 24 of your newspaper of this month, which said that Central Committee member Huang Shi was traveling to Jiangxi on the China Merchants Jiangshun wheel, and that Huang Yun, who was staying in Shanghai, and other Central Committee members, etc. I came to Nanjing for a meeting, and then I knew it was postponed, so I rested in Suzhou on the 33rd, and did not meet with reporters or have any conversations. What was published in the newspaper was inaccurate. Please correct it as a prayer. Sincerely, Huang Shi, 24th.</p>

<p>Released a Joint Statement Detailing the Trip South</p>
<p>Fourth Plenary Session Will Discuss Concrete Reform Plans</p>
<p>Zhang and Wang Went to Nanjing Last Night to Report to the Central Government</p>
<p>Central Committee members Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Wang Luyi, Chen Zhaoying, and others, who were dispatched by the Central Government to the Southwest to exchange views on the current situation and discuss various issues of national salvation, returned to Shanghai on the Jefferson President Wheel from Hong Kong at 8:30 yesterday morning. Zhang Ji and Wang Luyi took the night train at 11 o'clock last night to return to Nanjing first to report to the Central Government. Ma and Chen are scheduled to return to Nanjing today or tomorrow to attend the Central Standing Committee meeting to be held on the 28th to report everything. After Zhang and others arrived in Shanghai, in addition to issuing a written statement, they also met with reporters from various newspapers at the hotel to discuss the trip in detail. Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a banquet at the Foreign Guests Reception Center on Xialong Road at noon yesterday. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Together Yesterday Morning. Zhang Ji, Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, and Wang Luyi boarded the Asia President Wheel of the Dalai Company on the 9th and went south, traveling to Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Guangxi successively, enduring hardships for half a month. They completed their official duties on the 23rd and boarded the Jefferson President Wheel of the Dalai Company from Hong Kong to return south. At about 6:30 yesterday morning, they entered the Wusongkou. At 7:30, they docked near the No. 16 and 17 river piers in Bailianjing. Mayor Wu specially sent secretaries Huang Jianfen, Tang Shixuan, and others to welcome them by police boat. The Municipal Public Security Bureau also sent many water police officers to be on guard at the wharf. After Zhang, Ma, Chen, and Wang disembarked, they were accompanied by Huang Jianfen and others to take a police boat across the river. At 8:20, they arrived at the Xinguang Wharf and went directly to the East Asia Hotel to rest. In addition to the representatives of Mayor Wu, those who went to welcome them also included Legislative Yuan member Chen Jianru and reporters from various newspapers. Representatives of the Municipal Wharf Workers' Union and various industrial and commercial groups led hundreds of workers, holding colorful small flags, to line up to welcome them at the Xinguang Wharf.</p>
<p>Mayor's Welcome Banquet at Noon. The four committee members, Zhang, etc., were all wearing dark brown leather overcoats, their spirits were unusually full, and they were smiling. After landing amidst the cheers of the crowd, except for Ma, who took a car to his private residence on Jufu Road, Zhang, Wang, and Chen took a red car at 8:30 to the East Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road, entered rooms 701 and 703 reserved by the municipal government, and rested. Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city hosted a banquet at the Foreign Guests Reception Center on Xialong Road at noon yesterday to welcome Zhang and other four committee members, who ran for peace this time and worked for the country. He exhausted the landlord's friendship. During the banquet, he talked freely about the current situation for about two hours before the guests and hosts dispersed with joy.</p>
<p>Released a Written Statement. Zhang, Ma, Wang, Chen, and other four committee members jointly released a written statement yesterday morning as follows: We were dispatched by the Central Government to go south to Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Guangxi to discuss various national salvation issues with the Central Committee members in the south. We are sincerely concerned that the current situation is serious, and we should shoulder the heavy responsibility of the country. We are concerned that there is no way to stabilize internal and external conflicts, and to resist external aggression, in order to live up to the expectations of the people. As for the major issues of the party and government, we still need to discuss them. Therefore, the Central Government ordered us to go south, one to fully convey the Central Government's will to unite all comrades to save the country with sincerity and to exchange views on the current situation. Third, regarding the Fujian Incident, their actions of betraying the party and the country, soliciting foreign forces to sell out internal chaos, must be jointly and strictly corrected. This matter has also been discussed with comrades in the south. Furthermore, the Fourth Plenary Session will be held. In order to rectify and clarify party affairs and politics, the Central Government eagerly expects comrades in the south to express their opinions. We first went to Hong Kong to meet with Committee Member Hu Hanmin, and then went to Guangzhou to visit the Executive Department members Xiao Focheng, Deng Zeru, Chen Jitang, Zou Lu, Lin Yunga, Lin Yizhong, Liu Jiwen, Qu Fangpu, Huang Jilu, and other committee members and comrades, and conveyed the central government's intentions one by one. Then, from Guangzhou, we went to Nanning to meet with Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, and other Central Committee members in Guangxi. After returning to Guangdong, we met with Tang Shaochuan again. We went to Hong Kong again to visit Committee Member Hu Hanmin and Committee Member Wu Chaoshu. Committee Member Sun Ke went to the Philippines via Hong Kong and was able to meet in Hong Kong. This time, we have carefully achieved the mission entrusted to us by the Central Government. The situation of the talks everywhere was very cordial and harmonious. This Fourth Plenary Session will definitely have precise and practical plans that will be jointly proposed for discussion, in order to break the current crisis faced by the country and the nation, and to develop a new life in party affairs and politics. As for the Fujian Incident, comrades in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and the two Guangdongs unanimously believe that it is absurd and incomparable and must be strictly corrected. Otherwise, the life of the country and the nation will be cut off and exhausted by the rebels. We will now turn to Nanjing to report our mandate. At this point in national affairs, the people's expectations of those who shoulder the burden of the party and government are extremely strict and urgent. It is our hope that we can work together to achieve success and discuss a path to revival together.</p>
<p>Zhang Ji Meets Reporters. After the three Central Committee members, Zhang and others, arrived at the East Asia Hotel, reporters from various newspapers visited one after another, and Zhang met with them one after another, talking eloquently, without any tiredness. Zhang first described the journey, saying that when we first arrived in Hong Kong by boat, we met with Mr. Hu Zhantang twice, and when we returned via Wusong, we met with Mr. Hu again. In Guangdong, we had in-depth conversations with Xiao Focheng, Deng Zeru, Chen Jitang, Tang Shaoyi, Zou Lu, and other members. In Nanning, we met with Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Huang Xuchu, and other comrades. We only stayed in Guangxi for two days, but the journey to Guangdong and Guangxi took four days, as we traveled 1,130 li from Wuzhou to Nanning by public bus.</p>
<p>Severe Sanctions Against Fujian. The Southwest believes that Chen Mingshu and others are absurd and do not approve of the Fujian rebellion. The method of dealing with the Fujian rebellion should be to impose sanctions. However, the opinions of each person on the method of sanctions were not consistent. National political facilities are not entirely satisfactory to people. This is not unique to China. There is always room for discussion with Mr. Hu and the opinions of the Southwest people. In a word, the Southwest is not absolute to the Central Government, but relative, well-intentioned, and not malicious. Everyone in the Southwest advocates unity, because the country is in danger, and disunity is not enough to save the country. Unity has power, and power is enough to save the country. If there is no unity, nothing can be accomplished. Even Li Zongren said in his telegram to us that at this point in national affairs, unity is essential.</p>

<p>Sun Zhesheng to Return North Immediately. Zhang also said that Mr. Sun Zhesheng will return to Hong Kong from the Philippines in a few days, and then meet with Mr. Hu Zhantang and other members in Guangdong to discuss everything, and then return north. Because Sun's visit to Hong Kong last time was very hurried, he only met with Mr. Hu and did not have a long conversation, so he planned to stay in Hong Kong for a few days on the way back to have a thorough conversation.</p>
<p>Very Good Impression of Guangxi. Zhang finally said that we were impressed by the construction of Guangxi Province on this trip. The efforts of Mr. Li and Mr. Bai are worthy of admiration. They have implemented the urgent task of supporting the people's power and implemented the principle of subordinating soldiers to the regiment and subordinating generals to the school, so that all people have militia training, and military officers will become students, training the people's military strength, so that military strength is in the hands of the people. We hardly saw a soldier in Guangxi, and the so-called soldiers were mostly the people. According to statistics, the population of Guangxi Province is 13 million, and it is expected that after the success of the ten-year plan, the standing militia can be increased to 3 million, and now there are 300,000 people. Zhang praised the spirit of Guangxi at the end, calling it the spirit of Sparta (an ancient Greek country that advocated martial arts). If all provinces in China can follow suit and strengthen their own strength, there is no need to worry about external troubles.</p>
<p>Visited Xu Chongzhi and Others Separately. After the four representatives, Zhang and others, arrived in Shanghai, in addition to attending the banquet hosted by Mayor Wu, they first visited Central Committee member Xu Chongzhi in Shanghai at about 4 PM and talked for about an hour. Then they visited Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to discuss the results of the trip south, talking until about 7 PM before returning to their residence to rest. The two representatives, Zhang Ji and Wang Luyi, took the night train to Nanjing at 11 o'clock last night, while Ma Chaojun and Chen Zhaoying stayed in Shanghai for a while and will go to Nanjing today or tomorrow.</p>

<p>Municipal Party Headquarters Convened a General Assembly Yesterday</p>
<p>Li Liejun Hosted a Banquet for Old Comrades</p>
<p>Municipal Party Headquarters　Yesterday marked the eighteenth anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising. A commemorative meeting was held at 10:00 AM, convening representatives from all walks of life. Attendees included Wang Zongjian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs.</p>
<p>Cleanliness Slogans　The Municipal Health Bureau posted slogans for the twelfth cleanliness campaign in various streets and alleys, including "Maintain Street Cleanliness," "To Maintain Health, Pay Attention to Cleanliness," "Do Not Dump Garbage Anywhere," "Do Not Spit Anywhere," "Do Not Urinate or Defecate Anywhere," "Pay Attention to Public Hygiene," "Damaging the Streets Hinders the City's Cleanliness," "To Keep the Streets Clean, First, Refrain from Damaging Them," and over ten other common slogans with easily understood meanings.</p>
<p>Garbage Disposal　The Health and Public Safety Bureaus jointly posted a notice the day before yesterday to pilot a new garbage disposal method in the Second Precinct of the Second District. If successful, it will be gradually implemented citywide. Yesterday, the precinct dispatched patrol officers and two police officers to investigate door-to-door, removing old wooden and cement garbage bins at the entrances of the lanes. Eighty to ninety percent of shops and residents in the area had prepared new-style garbage bins. Those who had not were immediately urged to build them. Starting this morning, from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM and from 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM, sanitation workers from the Health Bureau will ring bells to notify the shops to dispose of their garbage.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Notification　The Bureau of Social Affairs yesterday instructed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify all shops and factories to carry out a major cleaning and assist in the sanitation campaign. The original recorded text is as follows: "Approved Health Bureau official letter No. 5904 states, 'The twelfth sanitation campaign in this city has been scheduled for the 25th of this month. Special attention will be paid to uniting citizens to carry out the cleaning of dirt and grime. Therefore, please inform the various industrial and commercial groups to notify all factories and shops to carry out a major cleaning and wash all walls, doors, and windows clean, arousing a sense of cleanliness and beauty in everyone to promote this. According to our country's old customs, each household originally had the act of sweeping the eaves, but most were unable to effectively implement it. This major cleaning is originally intended to awaken implementation. Please inform all factories and shops to earnestly implement it.' and so on. Approved, it is hereby ordered that the Chamber of Commerce be notified and instruct all trade associations to comply. This order." It is heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has already forwarded letters to the various trade associations in the city, instructing members to implement it.</p>
<p>Qiu Yunming of the Land Bureau, Zhang Yichen of the National Association for the Study of Confucian Teachings, Huang Zaoxiong of the Municipal Education Association, Wang Shunfa of the Second Special District Citizens' Federation, Mao Yun, He Yuanming of the Accountants' Association, Zhou Xuexiang of the General Labor Union, and over two hundred representatives from various labor unions, schools, and levels of party headquarters, chaired by Tong Xingbai, recorded by Zhu Xiaochun, and emceed by Zhang Hanyun, performed the rituals as usual. The chairman then reported on the Yunnan Uprising, stating (1) that we should follow the Premier's call to instill genuine democratic ideas into the masses and establish a genuine democratic nation. To achieve this goal, we must go through the period of political tutelage to avoid repeating the mistakes of the Xinhai Revolution. (2) The purpose of the Yunnan Uprising was to support the Republic of China and overthrow the imperial system. Recently, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, etc., under the guise of public opinion, changed the era name and established a system, which is the same as Yuan Shikai's self-amusement of proclaiming himself emperor. Both are acts that endanger the Republic of China. It is hoped that the people of the whole country will unanimously condemn them to establish a democratic nation and be worthy of the martyrs of the Yunnan Uprising. The meeting ended with slogans.</p>
<p>Li Liejun　Seventeen years ago, during the Yunnan Uprising, Li Liejun, along with Cai Songpo, Tang Jiyao, Luo Rongxuan, etc., led the troops to fight against Yuan Shikai and save the Republic of China from crisis. His contribution was great. Yesterday, on the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, Li Liejun, remembering his comrades who had risen up together in the past, now few and far between, and the deaths of Cai Geng and others, was deeply moved by the past and the present. Therefore, he specially gathered his old friends and colleagues at his residence on Rue Massenet yesterday at noon for a luncheon. Among those present were Xu Yuangao, former Secretary-General of the Second Army of the National Protection Army, Zhong Dong, Chief Counselor, Jin Weiqian, Chief of Staff, and Chen Rongsheng, and over twenty others. At the beginning of the meal, everyone observed five minutes of silence in memory of the martyrs. Then, they drank heartily and talked about the vicissitudes of life. After the meal, they showed each other correspondence and memorabilia, reminisced for a long time, and sighed endlessly. In the past two days, Li Liejun had received dozens of letters and telegrams of condolences from various parties, praising Li Liejun's efforts to overthrow Hongxian's imperial system and rebuild the Republic of China, wishing Li Liejun well for the country. Li Liejun was extremely grateful for the kindness of all parties and ordered his secretary Zhang Mi Gong to reply to each and express his gratitude. Li Liejun also spoke to reporters from various newspapers yesterday, saying that today is the anniversary of the Yunnan National Protection War against Yuan. Looking back on the past, it has been seventeen years. At that time, in the early days of the revolution and nation-building, everyone had great enthusiasm for implementing democracy and revitalizing China. Military and civilian leaders in various provinces were also able to solemnly protect their personal concepts and did not willingly submit to the powerful and become vassals. They sought only freedom and equality for the people of the whole country, without any discrimination. Therefore, when we called for justice, the response was overwhelming. Although we raised troops in remote areas, we were able to strip Yuan Shikai of his courage and ensure the safety of the republican system. This was not something that mere strong soldiers and brave generals could achieve, but was due to the support of the people. If the party members of today could still maintain the spirit of nation-building in the past, and enable the party to return to unity, and the people of the country to fully realize their intelligence, then the ruined national affairs can still be saved. I am old and unable to help with the difficulties of the times, and I am ashamed to face Cai Songpo, Tang Diying, Liu Ruzhou, and Luo Rongxuan underground.</p>

<p>Hopes for Prompt Dispatch of Senior Officials to Tibet</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Mr. Tan Yunshan, who previously went to Tibet to express condolences, has recently been employed by Visva-Bharati University in India and will soon go to India again to teach and study philosophy, and to carry out the affairs of the Sino-Indian Society. When reporters heard the news, they visited him at the Huda Academy. Tan expressed his grief over the death of the Dalai Lama, saying that the Dalai Lama had not caused any major harm to the country during his lifetime and had been quite beneficial to Tibet. His ambition and intentions, the highest of which was to restore the original state of Tibet in the fifth generation and make it independent and autonomous. Fortunately, he was unwilling to sever relations with the Central Government and wanted to achieve autonomy within China, without betraying the country or causing chaos, which did not conflict with the current policy of the Central Government and could cope with strong neighbors and preserve the territory. Tibet is not the Northeast or Outer Mongolia, which cannot be said to be the merit of the Dalai Lama. It is hoped that the Central Government will handle it well, promptly dispatch capable senior officials to Tibet to appease the people, and resolve various outstanding cases on the spot. At the same time, they should urge the Panchen Lama to enter Tibet to preside over religious affairs, to镇 [zhen] the place and appease the people, so that they can make one effort and achieve lasting peace, so that Tibet can have long-term stability and security, so as to consolidate the frontier.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Ministry of Finance Announces Issuance of Types A and B Factory Ingots Starting Next New Year's Day <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Central Mint Already Working Day and Night to Cast Them</p>
<p>Exchange of Silver Bullion for Silver Coins Exempt from Minting Fees</p>
<p>After our country implemented the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, the Central Bank was ordered to announce that all domestic and foreign silver houses and money shops must report and register their stored silver bullion within one month and exchange it for silver coins. The Central Mint began casting Types A and B factory ingots, which will be issued starting next New Year's Day. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Notice to Collect Silver Bullion　The Central Bank notified all banks and money shops in Shanghai that, "The Ministry of Finance has sent successive letters requesting that this bank forward a letter to the silver houses and money shops, both domestic and foreign, in Shanghai, to report the amount of silver bullion that was in circulation on the market before April 6 of this year within one month to this bank, which will then be forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for registration. After the Ministry sends personnel to verify it, it will be allowed to exchange it for silver standard coins from this bank at a rate of 715 per month." This should be complied with. In addition to having already sent a letter to the Silver Houses and Money Shops Association to forward a letter to all member silver houses and money shops to report the amount of silver bullion stored on April 6 and December 15 of this year (silver stored in other silver houses and money shops should be excluded, but silver stored in other silver houses and money shops should be included and noted), all banks and money shops that do not belong to the Silver Houses and Money Shops Association are also requested to investigate and report to this bank for forwarding. Special notice is hereby given.</p>
<p>Exemption from Minting Fees for Silver Coins　After the Ministry of Finance ordered the silver houses and money shops to report the silver bullion stored in the Central Bank within a time limit and exchange it for silver coins at a rate of 715, according to Article 11 of the Silver Standard Coinage Regulations, anyone who requests the Central Mint to cast silver standard coins with silver that can be used for coinage or old silver coins, such as old one-yuan silver coins that meet the original weight and silver content, will be exchanged for silver standard coins of the same value and will be exempt from minting fees. For silver with matching fineness, a minting fee of 2.25% of one yuan must be paid. If the fineness is too mixed, in addition to the minting fee, a refining fee will be added. Therefore, the exchange of silver bullion for new coins is subject to minting fees according to regulations. Now, all registered silver bullion is exempt from minting fees. This minting fee is recognized by the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<p>Notice to Issue Factory Ingots　The Ministry of Finance announced that, "The revised Article 12 of the Silver Standard Coinage Regulations states, 'The Central Mint may cast factory ingots, divided into Types A and B. Type A weighs 23.493448 grams, and its fineness is 999 per thousand. Type B weighs 26.6971 grams in total, with 880 parts silver and 120 parts copper, equivalent to 1,000 yuan in silver standard coins, and all are marked on their faces.' " This has been promulgated and implemented, and the Ministry has approved the forms of the two types of factory ingots and presented them to the Executive Yuan for submission to the National Government for record, and ordered the Central Mint to cast them. It is now scheduled that January 1, 1934, will be the date for the commencement of the issuance of Types A and B factory ingots to meet the needs of the market. However, Type B factory ingots are originally intended to facilitate the receipt and settlement between silver houses and money shops and are not applicable to the transfer of private individuals to show restrictions. In addition to separately informing and ordering the Silver Houses and Money Shops Association to instruct all silver houses and money shops to strictly abide by the Type B factory ingots' transfer restrictions and not to interfere with external conduct, this notice is hereby announced for all to know.</p>
<p>Rushing to Cast Types A and B Ingots　The Central Mint's casting of new coins is all issued by the Central Bank. Now, it has been circulated throughout the country. After the Review Committee decided to issue Type B factory ingots for the convenience of the silver houses and money shops, the Ministry of Finance approved the casting. Once the quantity is reached, it will be submitted to the Review Committee's chemist for review and handed over to the Central Bank for issuance. As for Type A factory ingots, by the end of November, 951 ingots had been inspected and qualified and sent to the Central Bank for storage, waiting for issuance on New Year's Day next year. The factory has been working day and night to rush to cast Types A and B factory ingots.</p>

<p>Central Commissioners Have Returned to Nanjing to Report Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, after the entire workforce of the Wusong Zhang Huabang Road Machinery Factory and the Materials Factory went on strike on the 18th of this month, the Central Organization Committee and the Ministry of Railways sent personnel to Shanghai to mediate, and two resolutions were reached that were agreed upon by the workers. They announced a complete resumption of work yesterday morning. The Central Commissioners also returned to Nanjing by train yesterday morning to report.</p>

<p>Over 1,200 workers at the Two Road Machinery Factories and the Materials Factory declared a work slowdown on the 18th of this month to protest against Mo Heng, the Chief of the General Affairs Office and concurrent Chief of the Materials Office. After the Railway Bureau and the Party Headquarters of the Two Roads submitted petitions to the central authorities requesting intervention, the Central Organization Committee dispatched Luo Meihuan, Director of the General Affairs Section, and Wang Wenbin and Zhang Weici, Counselors of the Ministry of Railways, to Shanghai to join the Railway Bureau, the Party Headquarters, and the Labor Union in persuading the workers and to reach two resolutions. With the workers' agreement, the Wusong Office and all foremen led all the workers to resume work at 7:00 AM yesterday. By 7:30 AM, the workers in each section were working as usual, and the order was quite good. The Party Headquarters and the Labor Union of the Two Roads also posted notices urging the workers to work with peace of mind. The Mo Heng issue will be investigated and handled by the Party and the Labor Union within one week and submitted to the Central Government.</p>

Now that a resolution has been announced, the commissioners sent by the Central Government took the train to return to Nanjing yesterday morning to report. After the Central Government thoroughly investigates the truth, the part of the workers' accusation against Mo Heng will be handed over to the Ministry of Railways for handling.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Party Headquarters Announcement <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The Executive Committee of the Special Party Headquarters of the Nanjing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway issued an announcement yesterday, stating that the Wu Song Machine Factory sub-office workers alleged that the director of the general affairs and material department, Mo Heng, used his position for personal gain, mismanaged affairs, undermined the labor movement, and attacked the Party Headquarters, requesting his removal from office and investigation, and advocating perseverance in waiting for a resolution. The Executive Committee expressed deep regret for the occurrence of this incident. Considering the current situation of suppressing bandits and punishing rebellion, the stability of the rear is extremely worrying. The railway is a national transportation organization, and any imprudent action can confuse public opinion. Workers have been serving in state-owned industries for a long time and have a deep love for the Party and the country and even greater enthusiasm. It is hoped that they will overcome the difficulties together and work as usual with peace of mind from now on. It should be known that supporting labor is a consistent policy of the Party. The Executive Committee should accept the workers' report of Mo Chong's undermining of the labor movement and attacking the Party Headquarters and undertake to request the Central Government to dismiss and investigate him within one week as a special announcement. All workers are hereby notified to be aware of this and not to make mistakes. This announcement.</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of the Labor Union of the Nanjing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Directly Under the Ministry of Railways announced that all members of the Wusong Machine Factory sub-office belonging to the Labor Union alleged that the director of the general affairs and material department of the Railway Bureau, Mo Heng, undermined the labor movement, engaged in malpractice for personal gain, and attacked the Party, and his behavior was extremely erratic, and requested the Labor Union to request his removal from office and investigation. The attitude of the members was firm and they waited for a resolution. The Labor Union was extremely saddened by the occurrence of this incident. At the time of the Fujian rebellion, the situation was extremely tense. Our two railways are the lifeline of the national industry, and any imprudent action is likely to confuse public opinion. The members have been serving on the road for a long time and have a special enthusiasm for safeguarding the labor movement. They must overcome the difficulties together and work with peace of mind from now on. The reporting of Mo Heng's various malpractices should be accepted and submitted to the higher-level Party Headquarters for submission to the Central Government, and he will be dismissed and investigated within one week. This announcement is hereby issued, and all members are notified that there should be no violations. This announcement.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Salvaging the Yuji Steamer <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Problems with the Cargo in the First and Second Holds</p>
<p>The Yuji steamer of the Yu Da Company, which ran aground on Donggua Mountain in Wenzhou, has been reported in this newspaper several times. Salvage work is currently underway, but negotiations have taken place regarding the jettisoning of cargo losses. Further news is provided below.</p>
<p>Survey of Damage　The Yu Da Company and the Joint Insurance Office jointly dispatched the Sanjiang steamer, carrying engineers, divers, and workers, who have started inspecting the extent of the damage to the hull of the sunken ship at the scene. Divers entering the sea to investigate found two holes in the bottom of the first and second holds. Fortunately, the area is not large, and it is hoped that they can be filled. However, the hull is half-aground on the reef and half-floating on the sea surface, and there is deep concern that it may break off over time. The hull may also be in danger. Therefore, the shipowner used the thickest steel wire to temporarily secure the front of the hull to avoid accidents.</p>
<p>Proceeding with Salvage　According to telegrams from the shipowner and engineers, it is hoped that the Yuji can be salvaged. It may take about a week or ten days to complete the filling of the two holes in the bottom of the hold, then the accumulated water in the ship will be pumped out, so that the front hold can float to the sea surface, and it can then sail to Shanghai because the machinery between the engine rooms is not damaged at all. Currently, from the shipowner down, they are staying on Donggua Mountain to proceed with salvage work and are not taking the Sanjiang steamer back to Shanghai first.</p>
<p>Cargo Jettisoning Issue　The cargo loaded in the first and second holds of the ship is all olives and oranges. After running aground, they were immersed in water and completely damaged. Now, in order to repair the holes in the bottom of the ship and proceed with the pumping of water, all the water weeds in the first and second holds must be removed and jettisoned, otherwise it will be impossible to start work. Regarding the issue of jettisoning the cargo in the two holds, the shipping company notified the merchants, and the cargo owners, who had water insurance, had to notify the underwriters. This move is of great importance. The merchants have begun to negotiate with the insurance companies. The merchants' intention is that, regardless of whether the cargo is jettisoned or not, the underwriters should be liable for compensation. If the insurance companies agree, the salvage work can be carried out. As for the cargo in the rear hold, it is still intact.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Puppet State Organizes a Tourist Group <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Invites Shanghai Business Community to Participate</p>
<p>What Will the Chinese People Think?</p>
<p>The Northeast has been seized for three years in an instant. The League of Nations' declaration of non-recognition of the puppet state has also reached all over the world. The puppet state, on the contrary, boasts of its achievements and organizes a so-called tourist group to Shanghai to entice Shanghai's domestic and foreign merchants to join the group. The Chinese people, heartbroken by the loss of their province, naturally have no intention of joining. Even foreign merchants from friendly countries, fearing the League of Nations' justice, will not want to join either. Its news is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing a Manchurian Inspection Group　Since the September 18th Incident, the puppet Manchu authorities have been isolated from commercial and economic relations with Guannei [Inner China] for more than three years. Now, they claim that order has been restored and that the volunteer army has been cleared, so the Japanese Travel Agency has initiated the organization of a "Manchurian" inspection group. This is the first time since the September 18th Incident. Its members are gathered in Changchun and Shenyang and come to Shanghai via Dalian Bay. The main purpose is to request Shanghai's merchants to join. The date for the inspection in Manchuria is the Chinese New Year, taking the opportunity of the rest of all sectors to ask them to visit the Northeast.</p>
<p>Inviting the Shanghai Business Community to Join　Half a month ago, there was news in Shanghai that the "Manchukuo" had requested the assistance of the Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai, hoping that all foreign merchants in Shanghai would send one or two representatives to join the inspection group to observe the achievements of the puppet state's governance over the past three years. Therefore, more than a week ago, the Japanese Travel Agency in Shanghai asked all merchants to send personnel to join and notified the method, and the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai also supported the agency to invite on their behalf.</p>
<p>Travel Expenses and Other Items Are All Waived　It is heard that "Manchukuo" will offer special treatment to the first inspection group to the Northeast, and all travel expenses for the round trip from Shanghai to Dalian by waterway, and from Dalian Bay to Shenyang by train, will be waived. The "Manchukuo" will bear all the expenses. Its purpose is mainly to have representatives of various merchants in Shanghai go to the Northeast as the starting point for the development of business and economy of "Manchukuo".</p>
<p>Few Shanghai Merchants Joined　Although the Shanghai merchants were the first to inspect the group after it was organized by "Manchukuo," the economy of all industries this year is in recession, and they have no intention of going to the Northeast for inspection. Even if there is no travel expense, most of them politely decline the request to join the group. Only a few representatives of certain foreign firms in Shanghai agreed to join the group, and there were very few Chinese participants.</p>
<p>Manchurian Group Will Come to Shanghai Soon　The Shanghai side received news yesterday that the tourist group departing from Manchuria to Shanghai has left Shenyang and is going to Dalian Bay to transfer to the sea route to Shanghai. It is estimated that it will arrive here on Sunday. The majority of the group is Japanese, and the minority is from the Northeast. The group originally planned to join a large number of Shanghai members in Shanghai to go to Manchuria together. It is heard that the stay in Shanghai is very short, and they still have to go to Dalian by sea and then transfer to the Northeast.</p>

<p>The company stated that despite the war,</p>
<p>flights will not be suspended unless absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>China National Aviation Corporation's routes, due to yesterday being the Yunnan Uprising Memorial Day and coinciding with Monday, had no flights arriving or departing on any routes. According to the company spokesperson, the Shanghai-Guangdong route, since the Fujian Incident, has not encountered any obstacles passing through Xiamen and Fuzhou, as the airline is purely a commercial entity. Although war has broken out recently, it has not been affected, so it continues to operate as usual. The company, for the convenience of transportation and to maintain operations, will not suspend flights unless absolutely necessary. It is expected that there will be a three-day holiday for the New Year, but flights on all routes will operate as usual during the holiday.</p>

<h3 id="e138">End of Fundraising by the Aviation Association <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the China Aviation Association held a fundraising campaign for membership funds, and donations were very enthusiastic. However, the hotels, fresh pork industry, and Nanyang Tobacco Company have yet to agree on a method or have not yet paid the donations. The fundraising team office is actively negotiating to achieve results before the office closes. The information obtained is as follows:</p>
<p>Hotel Industry: The Shanghai Hotel Industry had previously pledged to donate 200,000 yuan. The office had already reported it to the Aviation Association, and the office sent personnel to negotiate the collection method, but no agreement has been reached. It is now known that Chief Commander Wu Tiecheng and Chairman Wang Xiaolai of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will invite the standing committee of the hotel industry association and the owners of hotels that have not joined the association to discuss the method at the Bankers Association this afternoon, and a decision can be made at that time.</p>
<p>Fresh Pork Industry: The municipal fresh pork selling industry pledged to donate 20,000 yuan for aviation, and collection has already begun. However, the industry had offices in Wusong, Nanshi, and Yangjing, and the office expenses used were not small. It had previously sent a letter to the Chief Commander's office requesting a subsidy. It is now known that the office has agreed to allocate a subsidy of about 100 yuan.</p>
<p>Nanyang Company: Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company pledged to donate 100,000 yuan, designated for the training of flight personnel. The Aviation Association had plans to organize a flying club at the time, but it was delayed due to lack of funds for preparation. According to Lin Kanghou, a standing committee member of the Aviation Association, the planning for the flying club has been going on for a long time, and various budget plans have also been published. In order to actively proceed, Chief Commander Wu Tiecheng has sent a letter to the company to pay half of the amount first for the purpose of preparing for the establishment, but no reply has been received yet.</p>

<p>Twenty-seven villages in Dachang have suffered severely from the Japanese army.</p>
<p>The villagers are starving and freezing, hoping for immediate allocation of funds for relief.</p>
<p>Zhu Qinglan sent a letter to the Xinwei Relief Society yesterday, saying: "I am honored to have received a letter from Mr. Tao Xingzhi stating that the 27 villages where the Shanhai Industrial School is located are close to Dachang and have suffered severely from the Japanese army. The people's lives are very difficult. After a preliminary investigation by our school, more than 100 families are cold and have no clothes, and are hungry and greedy. Colleagues cannot sit idly by. In addition to saving clothes and food to provide some relief, the weather is already cold, and the wind and frost are deadly. There is an urgent need for 100 sets of cotton clothes and 30 sets of cotton quilts to alleviate the current situation. We hope you will appeal for donations to help them survive, etc., and attach an investigation form. The school's work is very practical. I have personally visited the area and know that the residents of the 27 villages suffered from the Japanese army during the January 28 Incident, and the poor farmers listed in the survey need cotton clothes and quilts, which are all true. They are nearby in Shanghai, and the number is not large, so it is appropriate to allocate them to save lives. I specially forward this to you, hoping that you will show compassion and preside over the implementation, with utmost anticipation."</p>

<h3 id="e141">Lu Zhixin Sues Prostitute Yang Wenjuan <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Yang sends letter to Lu demanding living expenses</p>
<p>Lu sues for attempted fraud</p>
<p>Yang Wenjuan, whose stage name is "Mei," was a prostitute in Minhe Lane. Because she was acquainted with local Lu Zhixin, Lu often visited her when Yang was working as a prostitute, so their friendship had a tendency to develop further. On the 14th of this month, Yang specially hired a lawyer to send a letter to Lu Zhixin, stating that Lu owed 2,030 yuan in cohabitation living expenses, and a diamond ring worn by Lu, worth 1,500 yuan. In addition, he also owed a loan of 1,000 yuan, totaling 4,530 yuan, which must be paid off within three days. He also demanded 20,000 yuan in alimony in the future. If he did not pay, he would be pursued according to law. After receiving the letter, Lu completely denied that there was any such entanglement, and immediately hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to reply in addition to the letter, and filed a criminal self-accusation against Yang Wenjuan for fraud. It was pointed out that when Yang Wenjuan was setting up a brothel in Minhe Lane, she often accompanied her friends to socialize. The defendant learned that the plaintiff had some assets and asked someone to express her willingness to commit herself as a concubine and rented a house as a place for the two to live together. The plaintiff refused because she was from a brothel and it was not appropriate to collude and tarnish her reputation. After that, he never invited guests to socialize again. The so-called "cohabitation," "living expenses," "diamond ring," "loan," etc., are not only not facts, but also have no impact. The various sections in the letter are obviously the defendant's prior fabrication of facts, hoping to intimidate out of thin air in order to achieve her intention of fraud. Her behavior is in violation of Article 363, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Law, the crime of attempted fraud. Please summon the case and investigate it according to law, etc. Yesterday afternoon, judge Wu Jiazhu of the First Special District District Court opened the Fifth Court to summon the case. The defendant Yang Wenjuan was absent, and the plaintiff Lu Zhixin appeared in court with his lawyer to state the intention of the prosecution. The court then ordered the defendant to be summoned to court again for questioning at a later date.</p>
<h3 id="e142">The Big Disturbance of Searching and Copying Flower Clubs <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Gao Maosheng boarded the building and searched without authorization</p>
<p>Li Ming's flower club has human evidence</p>
<p>—Both parties have been prosecuted by the prosecutor—</p>
<p>In this city, the flower club is rampant, no less than a flood and beast, so the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Bureau Affairs Conference severely investigated and handled it. Therefore, senior police officers and the Inspectorate Office were also assigned special inspectors to work. The inspector Gao Maosheng usually works hard to catch gambling. At 10 AM on the 13th of last month, he brought his assistants and the police chief to search for flower clubs in the six or seven evening restaurants opened by Fujianese Li Ming at the Gaochang Temple Jiangbian Wharf in the Nanshi. He went straight into the inner room to search, and as a result, he found more than 300 pieces of paper from the flower club. However, he did not take anyone with him at the time, and when Li Ming returned home, he lost more than 800 yuan in banknotes and many valuable ornaments such as gold bracelets, gold rings, and gold rings. Therefore, he separately presented it to the Public Security Bureau and the District Court, requesting an investigation. The prosecutor Xie Lian summoned Gao Maosheng and Li Ming to be arrested and detained, and did not dislike seeking detailed investigation and summoning police chief Ma Rongsheng to prove that Gao Maosheng went upstairs to search alone, and as a civil servant, the search should be carried out with the defendant or his family members present to be legitimate. Now Quan searched for stolen goods and did not take anyone with him. He argued that there was no one present at the time, so he did not take anyone with him. However, since no one was present, the search was illegal and there was a suspicion of theft. Regarding Li Ming's part, although Li Ming said that the inspectors were accustomed to throwing stolen goods to frame him, the stolen goods were discovered, so he made up a note to resist. He also summoned his wife Li Linshi, who said that her husband used to be a flower club listener and has now changed.</p>

<p>Secretary Wang of the Zhejiang Construction Department Notified the Route Order Yesterday</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway will hold a full-line opening ceremony on the 28th of this month. More than 40 Chinese and foreign journalists participated in the grand event. On the Shanghai side, Secretary Wang Yingbin of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department was preparing everything in Shanghai. The route order has already been notified. It is scheduled to gather at the Daily News Association at 7:30 AM on the 27th. Later, due to the large number of people, it was changed to gather at the News Newspaper Building. At 8 AM, take the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company's car to depart, and Cheng Zhou Xiang Sheng gave special discounts, charging half the price. At 9 AM, after crossing the Minhang Ferry, the Zhejiang Construction Department will have long-distance highway buses waiting to meet you in Minhang.

Western reporters will be provided with accommodation at the Xiling Hotel. Along the way, Huacheng Tobacco Company will donate cigarettes.</p>
<p>It is also reported that the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway will hold a full-line opening ceremony in Jinhua on the 28th. The Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department is actively preparing and has sent letters to invite people from all walks of life to participate. It is now known that the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau has appointed Secretary Fan Shouchi as its representative to participate.</p>
<p>He said that even if it was illegal to possess opium, silver notes and banknotes would never be prohibited. Moreover, he mistakenly sent him a letter to Chairman Jun, requesting a thorough investigation, etc. After receiving the presentation, Director Wen immediately instructed Director Zhang of the Pudong Third District to reply. Director Zhang secretly discussed the method with Patrol Officer Cui, the petitioning police officer at the wharf, because the matter concerned the reputation of the police, and entrusted the patrol officer to be responsible for the investigation. Patrol Officer Cui only had Cui Zhaozong, a police officer under his command, but he was convinced that his usual behavior was loyal and he would never dare to confiscate opium, silver oceans, etc. Therefore, without making a sound, he took the police officer to a secret place to question him, asking if there were any enmities outside. After thinking for a long time, police officer Cui seemed to realize something, and then said that only one Yao Hongsheng had previously stolen food at the wharf and bribed me. I did not allow it and intercepted the stolen goods, so I formed an enmity, which is also unknown. Yao is located at No. 120 Taoyuanzhai Road, etc. Patrol Officer Cui reported the situation to the district chief. District Chief Zhang sent plainclothes police to secretly investigate and learned that Yao was illiterate, but there was a Li Sen who had been a cook in the Third District, who was quite literate and had no occupation. He was very friendly with Yao and often boarded and lodged at Yao's place.</p>
<p>For eight years, asked, how many people are in the family, answered, mother, sister, wife, brother, daughter-in-law, four women, and three buddies, two children, at ten o'clock in the morning on the 13th of last month, they brought seven or eight people, mostly plainclothes, rushed into the room, rummaged through the boxes and searched. At that time, because the 14th was my mother's birthday, I went to Hongkou to meet relatives and was not at home. My family's mother, wife, and relatives had already arrived in large numbers. They entered the room and were not allowed to enter by family members. Afterwards, they did not take anyone away, and it was not that there was no one, so the money and banknotes were stolen, so I reported it to the bureau. Asked, are you a flower club listener? Answered that I really don't do it. Asked, then where did more than 300 flower club papers come from? Answered, I don't know where he got it from. Between, why didn't you appear in court in the Public Security Bureau? Answered, they never summoned me once from beginning to end, and this time I appeared in court, it was the court's subpoena. At this point, the official asked if you have a wife named Li Linshi, answered, yes, the official asked if there was a Li Linshi in the audience, and the woman responded and came out. The official, because she was related, ordered her to leave the seat, and then asked Li Ming, your wife Li Linshi, he said that he used to be a flower club listener, and now he doesn't do it, etc. Then his defense lawyer immediately defended that, regarding this point, Li Linshi said that there used to be a tenant who did it, and now the tenant has moved out and doesn't do it anymore, etc. The official said, this is recorded in the minutes, how can it be mixed up? At this point, the official Tieben's content of the case has not been investigated clearly, and the hall will wait for clarification before proceeding with the trial, and the lawyers on both sides rose up and requested bail, all replied that they were ill, the official said, in this case, before the investigation is clear, whether the defendants are guilty or innocent, cannot be determined, but the circumstances are very large, and the prosecution is also heavy, and bail cannot be granted, if there is a disease, the detention center has its own medical officer, or sent to the hospital for treatment, it is nothing more than serving the line only, so the court ordered not to allow it, so he ordered the defendant to sign, then Gao Maosheng said, I am illiterate, I can't write, the official said that the inspector of senior police officers is illiterate, it is really a waste of people, so he ordered to take fingerprints together, scolded the court soldiers to take them down for detention, and then continued to investigate and find out the truth, so he adjourned the court.</p>
<p>The situation of Chu, the district chief, sent personnel to find Li's handwriting, and after comparing it with the original presentation, the handwriting was exactly the same. Then he confirmed that the secret presentation was Yao's suspicion and instructed Li to draft and submit a presentation to the bureau for false accusation, and immediately sent police to Yao's residence yesterday, and took Yao and Li to the district at the same time. District Chief Zhang interrogated them separately. According to Yao's confession, he was 37 years old and from Shandong. He flatly denied the incident of fabricating a false accusation against Cui police officer. According to Li's confession, he was 47 years old and from Hebei, and lived at No. 40 Shenyuli. At first, he firmly denied that he had written a presentation for others to accuse Cui police officer. Later, after the district chief compared the original presentation with his handwriting, Li admitted that recently, a wharf rascal stole salted fish and was stopped by Cui police officer. The rascal held a grudge and asked someone to draft a presentation and hand it over to me to write. Afterwards, he gave me eight dimes, so the presentation was not instructed by Yao to write, etc. The district chief immediately asked Li how the rascal had someone write a presentation on his behalf, why should he entrust you to write it again, which is obviously untrue. Li was speechless at this point, so he confessed the truth, claiming that because I have been unemployed for a long time, I have been materially helped by Yao and cannot repay him. Last year, Yao planned to marry a young girl, but the girl was suddenly interfered with by Cui police officer and betrothed to Cui's nephew as his wife. Yao and Cui police officer had a feud on this matter. Yao waited until a year later, and only recently instructed me to fabricate the facts and falsely create the name Zhang Yuji, and submitted it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to falsely accuse the police officer in order to vent his hatred, etc. District Chief Zhang obtained the confession, and Qiao mentioned Yao for questioning with Li. Yao still denied the matter. The district chief, with both human and physical evidence, immediately ordered to prepare a document to send the two defendants to the headquarters for disposal.</p>

<p>The International Road Association holds an International Road Conference every three years, convening specially appointed representatives from governments around the world, as well as member representatives, to gather together, study improvements in land transportation, and report on various association affairs and engineering projects. The seventh conference is scheduled to be held in Munich, Germany next September. The German Minister to China has sent a note to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and requested that the Ministry forward it to the Ministry of Railways, the National Economic Committee, and the China National Roads Association, requesting that they send special representatives to attend. It is heard that the local Road Association is a member of the association and has official letters and publications to exchange. Regarding this conference, in addition to distributing the six conference topics to experts and members of the association's road administration for detailed answers, so as to compile and send them, in accordance with the practice of previous conferences, representatives will be sent to Germany to participate, exchange opinions on improving road administration, and observe the implementation of local road administration, so as to provide a reference for road construction and maintenance in our country, and increase international glory.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Two Roads Administration Improves Ticket Selling Methods at All Stations <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Any window can purchase tickets for any station</p>
<p>Tickets for the day can be used on any equivalent train</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administrations have a total of twenty-two ticket windows at the Shanghai North Station ticket office. In the past, certain windows were designated to sell tickets for specific stations. Literate passengers do not have much difficulty, but illiterate passengers often have no way to choose among the twenty-two windows, and they often do not know which stations they want to go to are between. It is very difficult for them to ask back and forth. In order to facilitate travelers, the Administration has decided to adopt the following principles and methods: (1) All ticket windows at all stations on the two lines will not be limited to selling tickets for specific stations. That is, passengers can purchase tickets to any station at any window. (2) All windows will be open for ticket sales all day and night, so that passengers can purchase tickets for any class, any train, and any station at any time. (3) Tickets sold on the day can be used on any equivalent train on the day. (4) Stations with more windows are allowed to distinguish between the locations for issuing tickets according to the class of the ticket. However, in any case, the number of windows issuing third- and fourth-class tickets must not be less than eight-tenths of the total. (5) Ticket sellers will not distinguish between each other in principle, but for the convenience of work, they can also handle them separately according to the special circumstances of each station. The above items have been carefully planned by the Traffic and Accounting Departments, and will be implemented from January 1, 1934.</p>

<p>Since the Ministry of Finance increased the unified cement tax, more than 2,500 construction companies in this city have suffered significant losses, which is obviously worrying. The Shanghai Municipal Construction Association and the Shanghai Municipal Construction Factory Trade Association, because their members have asked for ways to remedy the situation, submitted a petition to the Ministry of Finance yesterday to withdraw the order, so as to promote production and sales and relieve business difficulties. The original text is recorded below:</p>
<p>Petition for increasing the unified cement tax, which hinders progress, and earnestly request to withdraw the order, so as to relieve difficulties, and respectfully request review and approval. We believe that the country has many disasters and the treasury is stretched. Increasing financial resources is indeed a key task. Therefore, when your ministry announced the doubling of the unified cement tax, the associations felt deeply that national goods would be greatly affected, and motivated by patriotic enthusiasm, they convened a meeting and most expressed their approval, and resolved that this sudden increase in the unified tax was not included in the budget and should be borne by the owners, and separately published announcements in various Chinese and foreign newspapers in Shanghai, and since the implementation, many difficulties have arisen. There are several reasons for this: first, only increasing domestic goods will lead owners to abandon domestic cement and use foreign cement sold at discounted prices; second, the implementation is too hasty and there is no time to prepare; third, the sudden increase of one time is unbearable. With these several reasons, disputes will inevitably arise. The associations have insight into the fatigue of industry and commerce and deeply do not want to see social unrest again. In recent days, members of the associations have again said that the losses are very heavy and obviously worrying, and have repeatedly requested remedies. The associations are worried about the unpredictable nature of the requests from fellow industries and the bleak sales of domestic cement, and dare not avoid冒凟, and express their sincere wishes, and petition your ministry to review and approve, and withdraw the order to double the unified cement tax, and still collect six cents as usual, so as to benefit production and sales and relieve business difficulties, which is a great benefit. I am very eager to look forward to it. I respectfully submit,</p>

<p>Two Westerners and the driver injured</p>
<p>The *Continental Daily* reports that Mr. Stokeskin, an employee of the Holland Bank, and another Westerner, Mr. Van Kejtejian, were on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road two kilometers north of Zhapu yesterday (the 24th). Their car suddenly overturned into a ditch. Both of them and the driver were injured. Fortunately, the car had a steel body, and although everyone was crushed inside, the injuries were not serious. Stokeskin and the driver only suffered skin abrasions and returned to Shanghai yesterday. Mr. Fan was admitted to a hospital in Zhapu for treatment. His collarbone was broken and will likely need to be reconnected. He is expected to take the train back to Shanghai last night. It is reported that no other vehicles passed by when the accident occurred. The Mardi Automobile Company has sent a car to transport the accident car back to Shanghai.</p>

<p>The sixth section will begin soon</p>
<p>The sixth section of the Puhuitang Canal project in this city will begin dredging soon. The project requires approximately 115,000 yuan. The Puhuitang Canal Dredging Committee has raised 70,000 yuan for the project, and the Municipal Government has allocated 30,000 yuan. There is still a shortage of 15,000 yuan. The Municipal Government believes that the Songhu Post-War Rehabilitation Committee still has surplus funds in handling Songhu post-war rehabilitation matters, which have been temporarily kept by the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, the Municipal Government has consulted the Ministry of Finance to allocate 15,000 yuan from the surplus funds, so that the funds will be fully available and dredging can begin.</p>

<p>Since the beginning of winter in this city, the weather has been very warm. The temperature on the Fahrenheit thermometer is often between 40 and 50 degrees. Therefore, pedestrians on the road are all wearing camel hair or thin cotton clothes. Few people wear leather clothes. As for Zhu Jingmiao, which is more than seventy li northwest of Shanghai, in the territory of Huahe Town (in the territory of Taicang County), all the wheat planted by a certain surname and others in the northern three li of the town are on sunny highlands, and all of them are blooming and bearing fruit. It is widely spread as a strange story. According to the small wheat, it matures in the spring. It needs to bloom and bear fruit in March and April and be harvested in May. At this time, the severe winter is approaching, but it is like the spring order. It is really a strange thing, so it is specially recorded for the study of botanists.</p>

<p>To relieve the suffering of policyholders</p>
<p>Request prompt handling</p>
<p>Ye Jiaxing, an executive member of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, recently met with Wu Xingya, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, regarding the fire insurance claim in the Zhabei disaster area, and requested prompt handling to relieve the suffering of the policyholders. Mr. Wu accepted the request. Because the weather has been getting colder in recent days, the policyholders are suffering from hunger and cold, and they often come to Mr. Ye's office to inquire about the progress. Mr. Ye Jiaxing sent a special letter to Director Wu yesterday appealing for the policyholders. The original letter is recorded below: Dear Sir, I was recently recommended by the Shanghai Disaster Area Fire Insurance Claim Association to present a letter to you, respectfully requesting your Bureau to handle the claim request of the Association as soon as possible to relieve the suffering of the policyholders. You agreed and instructed the responsible personnel to handle it immediately, showing deep concern for the people and great public gratitude. Now that the severe winter has arrived and the weather is bitterly cold, the first-class policyholders are displaced and facing death. Their situation is particularly pitiful. Representatives of those people often come to my office to inquire about the progress and ask me to forward their request. I am specially sending this message again, and I urge you to hand it over to the department for quick handling to provide relief. I apologize for bothering you again and again. The matter is unavoidable. I believe you will be able to understand. I also ask for good news first, so that I can forward it to comfort the public's expectations. I look forward to it very much. I respectfully wish you well,</p>

<p>Since the establishment of the National Arts Group of the Shanghai Christian Educational YMCA, many non-members have joined. Mr. Wu Yizhao, the general instructor of national arts, is very enthusiastic and sincere in promoting it. He has rich experience in teaching national arts. Recently, the method of leading the three-plate twelve-style with rigid and flexible advance and retreat has aroused the interest of scholars. This boxing style was passed down from Chen Tuan, the first master of Luyi, Henan. In the year of Yiwu, Mr. Wu came to Bianliang with his father and met Chen Shiguang, and began to learn this boxing style. Its skill is based on the mind, combining rigidity and flexibility, and using it appropriately. The world only knows that there is a distinction between internal and external schools, but they do not know that the internal and external schools come from the same path. The principles are the same. It is heard that the Six Harmony Eight Methods boxing style is dynamic and static, spiritual and transforming, and combines internal and external elements. It is now soliciting non-members to join in order to popularize it. The number is limited to 30 people. They must have a legitimate profession and accept men, women, old and young. Those who are interested in national arts and want to improve their health, please register at the National Arts Group of the YMCA at Baxianqiao. The time is from 5:30 pm to 9:30 pm. Brochures are available for collection.</p>

<p>Chen Xingji, the landlord of Qingshun Lane and Ruyi Lane on Beijing Road in this city, has increased the rent by 20% for the tenants. If they do not pay the increase, they will be ordered to move out, which has aroused the opposition of the tenants. At 4:00 pm yesterday, dozens of merchants, including Shengyuan, Hengyu, and Zhiyu, held an emergency meeting. They all said that business has been sluggish recently and the market is depressed. Moreover, there are many empty houses in the same lane that no one cares about. In such a non-prosperous situation, efforts should be made to reduce rent to alleviate business difficulties. There is no reason to increase rent. Therefore, they jointly decided to deposit the original rent separately and make further requests, and entrust a lawyer to negotiate. It is not known how the case will be resolved.</p>

<p>The Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief Association sent more than 20 refugees, old and young, from Hebei and other places who had come to Shanghai due to the disaster. They had no food or clothing and were crying for help. Their situation was very pitiful.

After arriving in Tianjin, they will be sent to their original hometowns in various places.</p>
<h3 id="e156">The Huangzai Disaster in Hua County, Henan Province is Serious <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Liu Zhi instructed the inspection and release office to relocate immigrants to find food</p>
<p>Yang Mingsheng submitted it to the Ministry of Railways for instructions</p>
<p>The Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief Committee reported yesterday that the Henan Inspection and Release Office submitted a request, which was based on the Henan Provincial Relief Committee's Letter No. 1779, which stated that the Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government, Liu, instructed that Hua County suffered the most serious Yellow River flood this year. Tens of thousands of acres of fertile land have become a swamp, and 300,000 people have become destitute. Without relief, as many as 120,000 people will not be able to survive. They have no land to cultivate and cannot return home. They are displaced and miserable. Winter is approaching. If we do not think of ways to provide relief, we will see them all filling the ditches. We plan to temporarily relocate the refugees in the disaster area to various counties along the Pinghan and Daoqing lines to find food. The Pinghan line will use Tangyin, Anyang, Jixian, Huaxian, Xinxiang, Zhengzhou, Xinzheng, Xuchang, Yancheng, and Linying stations as drop-off points, and the Daoqing line will use Huojia, Xiuwu, Boai, and Qinyang stations as drop-off points. The number of people relocated is limited to 50,000. The number of each batch will be notified to the Railway Bureau for verification after it is determined. All disaster victims taking the train will be made into badges by the association, with their names and hometowns filled in, and ordered to wear them on the left lapel to make them easy to identify. In addition to the association drafting a draft chapter and sending it to the Provincial Government for verification and implementation, we should also write to your office for assistance, and ask the disaster relief group to ask the Ministry of Famine and Taoism to order the Pinghan and Daoqing Railway Bureaus to check the immigration methods of the 18th and 20th years, and first Zhou order each road to allocate vehicles, all of which will be transported free of charge, and sent to the designated counties to find food, so as to benefit the disaster victims, and fulfill the public friendship, etc. It is true that the disaster situation in Hua County mentioned by the association is miserable, and it is proposed to check the disaster situation of the 18th and 20th years. The methods of immigrating and transporting disaster victims and sending them to nearby counties to find food, with a limit of 50,000 people, is indeed a key plan for disaster relief and control. Fus is considering the previous handling of the 20th year of the water disaster, and has already approved the allocation of vehicles from Zhengzhou Station to transport disaster victims from various counties in Henan in batches to Tongguan and transfer them to Shaanxi Province to find food, which can be verified. Now, as a result of the previous cause, it is related to the relief of disaster victims in the Yellow River area, so it is not convenient to ignore it. We should submit the facts and earnestly ask you to transfer it to the Ministry of Railways, and allow you to order the Daoqing Pinghan Railway Bureaus to allocate vehicles at any time and transport them free of charge to benefit the disaster victims. If it is possible, please also review and issue instructions for compliance, and consider it for the public good. I respectfully submit to Yang Mingsheng, Director of the Henan Inspection and Release Office, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Flood Disaster Relief Committee of the National Government.</p>

<p>A total of seven houses were burned down</p>
<p>Three fires broke out in Zhabei and Western Shanghai in succession last night and this morning. The situations were different and the losses were quite large. The details of each situation are recorded below:</p>
<p>Zou Yuantian's Home: At about 2:00 am yesterday morning, the home of resident Zou Yuantian on Songjiang Road, Zhabei, within the jurisdiction of the Fifth District of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, was not careful about fire. In an instant, smoke filled the air and the fire was fierce. It penetrated the roof. After the nearby police learned of it, they immediately notified the Zhabei fire brigades. Xun Ji Ji helped pump trucks to rush to the scene and tried their best to put out the fire. About half an hour later, the fire was extinguished. A total of two houses were burned down.</p>
<p>Xu Cui's Home: The home of Xu Cui, who lived at No. , North , Zhabei, was left on fire at 10:30 last night, and it suddenly became uncontrollable.

<h3 id="e160">Zhao Controls Wei Case Resumed Today <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Wei Tingrong, the former commander of the Chinese Killer Brigade in the French Concession and the current Chinese director of the French Engineering Bureau, has been in litigation with his brother-in-law Zhao Wei since the kidnapping case occurred. After Zhao Wei was investigated by the Garrison Command and the Military Law Department, Zhao Wei was declared innocent and released. Zhao Wei then filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court, accusing Wei Tingrong and his son of instigating false accusations and obstructing freedom. The Second Special Court once heard the case. The defendant Wei Tingrong and the plaintiff Zhao Wei both personally accompanied their lawyers to court. However, due to the issue of the participation of the police attorney, the judge believed that the court had never had a police attorney participate in the hearing of self-accusation cases. Therefore, although there was a debate, the judge finally stated that it was not convenient to set this precedent, and announced a postponement and submitted it to a higher level for explanation. It is heard that the Second Special Court has scheduled a second hearing in this case at 2:00 pm today. Both parties have prepared to accompany their original lawyers to court for the hearing. It is expected that there will be a debate at that time. It is also heard that if there are no special circumstances, this case is likely to be resolved.</p>

<p>Zhang Aina, a dancer at the Lian Fei Dance Hall, was lured to a hotel and raped by Xu Jiashi, a young college student from Guangdong living at No. 29 Ruihua Lane, at the intersection of Lian Feide Road and Belle Road last year. At that time, Xu personally wrote and signed a contract stating that he would marry her on a chosen day and would never abandon her. If he violated the previous agreement, he would be willing to compensate for the losses. Zhang was given the contract for safekeeping. From then on, the two of them went in and out of hotels and dance halls like husband and wife. Unexpectedly, flowers do not always bloom and the moon does not always stay round. Recently, Xu had a new love and abandoned Zhang. After searching for Xu, he avoided meeting her. Therefore, Zhang's mother, Zhang Wang, as her legal guardian, accompanied her daughter to hire a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation with the Second Special District Court, accusing Xu Jiashi of略誘遗弃 and attaching a civil suit requesting compensation for losses. After the court hearing, Xu was acquitted. Zhang Wang and Zhang Aina disagreed with the original judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court. The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is heard that after review by the High Court, it has issued summonses to both parties and notified the lawyers to schedule a joint panel hearing at 2:00 pm today.</p>

<p>Lawsuit Appeal Continues Hearing Yesterday</p>
<p>Family Reluctant to Exhume for Autopsy</p>
<p>Yang Ti'an from Haimen, Jiangsu, currently 44 years old, previously worked at the Garrison Headquarters. He resided with his wife, Huang (43 years old this year), at No. 71 Hengde Lane, Dapulu, Xujiahui Road in the French Concession. His son, Yang Songpu, 24 years old this year, currently works at the Municipal Security Office. In October of last year, through a matchmaker, he married Bian Zhen from Lishui (same age as Songpu). After their marriage in Shanghai, the young couple lived with the paternal grandparents. Initially, the couple's relationship was harmonious. In the autumn of this year, a daughter was born. Bian Zhen graduated from a junior high school in the countryside and had some literacy. However, she was naturally lazy and spoiled, gradually disrespecting her paternal grandparents and husband. By mid-October of this year, the couple's relationship completely broke down. Therefore, the young couple agreed to divorce. On the 27th of that month, they invited relatives to witness the signing of a divorce agreement. The daughter born was to be raised by Yang, who would provide Bian Zhen with 200 yuan for travel expenses to return to her maternal home. After signing the agreement, Bian Zhen packed her clothes and luggage that evening, preparing to depart the next day. Unexpectedly, the next day (28th), Bian Zhen went out and met her cousin Zhao Chuan, who lived at No. 124 Taras Road in the French Concession, and her cousin Chuan Rongzhen (siblings). They told her about the divorce from Yang. Upon hearing this, the siblings Chuan and Rongzhen felt that their cousin's divorce only resulted in 200 yuan, which was too cheap for Yang Songpu. Dissatisfied, at 7 PM that evening, Chuan accompanied by Rongzhen and Bian Zhen went to Yang's house to reason with Songpu. As Songpu was out, they spoke with Songpu's mother, Huang, at the staircase entrance. A disagreement arose, and they started arguing. Chuan and the others pushed Huang, causing her to lose her balance and fall down the stairs, sustaining injuries. Chuan Zhao, Chuan Rongzhen, and Bian Zhen immediately fled. Upon learning of this, Yang Songpu and his father returned home and sought medical treatment. On the 29th, Zhao Chuan and her siblings, along with Bian Zhen, went to the police station to report that Yang had forced the divorce. The police station, considering it a civil matter, did not accept the case. Unexpectedly, Huang succumbed to her injuries and died at 10 AM on the 30th of that month. The family placed the body in a coffin and temporarily stored it at the guildhall. Yang Songpu, aggrieved by his mother's death being caused by Zhao Chuan, Chuan Rongzhen, and others pushing her, hired lawyer Zhang Qingyue to file a lawsuit for criminal injury causing death against Chuan Rongzhen and Zhao Chuan at the Second Special District Court, requesting legal action. After the court's trial, due to insufficient evidence presented by the plaintiff, the two defendants were found not guilty. Yang Songpu, dissatisfied with the original judgment, again hired lawyer Zhang to file an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. Judge Sun Yunfu once summoned and investigated, stating that without examining the body, it was impossible to prove whether the death was caused by the injury and that an autopsy was necessary to determine guilt. The appellant claimed that his mother's injury had been certified by a doctor with a medical certificate as evidence, requesting exemption from the autopsy and unwilling to exhume the body again. The judge instructed the appellant to consider the matter further. Yesterday, another summons was issued, and both parties arrived on time. The judge asked the appellant Yang Songpu, "What is your decision after consideration?" Yang replied, "The people's intention is that the doctor has already provided proof, and we do not wish to exhume the body again. My grandmother also opposes another examination. However, legally, clarification is only possible after an examination. The people have no choice but to request the court to decide." Upon questioning, the appellee Zhao Chuan stated, "At 7 PM on the 28th, I sent Bian Zhen home and gave her some advice before returning home. Yang Songpu saw me out and I did not even see his mother, how could I have pushed her?" Chuan Rongzhen stated, "I have never been to Yang's house even once. Please investigate." At this point, the judge ordered both parties to leave and await further review.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Two Red Pill Operations Cracked <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Yang Zhen from Guangdong and Ding Huqing from Changshu recently established large-scale red pill (drug) sales operations at No. 169 Lao Bazi Road and No. 24 Gongyi Fang, Beisichuan Road. Their sales were extensive. The red pills were branded as "Fortune, Prosperity, and Longevity" in red and gray colors. Their customers were mostly acquaintances or brokers specializing in this trade, selling widely in both local and out-of-town markets, yielding substantial profits. A few days ago, Chief Inspectorate Anti-Drug Department Chinese Detective Song Bingzheng discovered this and, accompanied by Western Detective Bo Pu, secretly obtained a court search warrant. They arrested Yang and Ding at their addresses. However, these two locations were merely liaison offices for customers, and no evidence could be found. Upon learning that Yang resided at No. 989 Beisichuan Road, they rushed to his home and confiscated three pounds of red pills, five pounds of gray pills, along with red pill manufacturing molds, materials, and a large quantity of morphine. They were all taken to the Hongkou Police Station early in the morning and sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin described the details, adding that defendant Ding Huqing was also involved in selling morphine for profit. In April of this year, Detective Song, who handled the case, sent an informant posing as a customer to purchase ten pounds of morphine from him. He demanded payment in advance, but the deal fell through due to the lack of such a large sum. There were several other shareholders in the operation who remain at large. An examination of the accounts revealed purchases from the Zhongwai Pharmacy of "three points" and payments to "Hongye" in September of the nineteenth year. The codes "three points" (heroin) and "Hongye" (red pills) indicated that the operation had been running for many years. He requested an extension for further investigation. The exhibits were presented to the judge, who questioned the two defendants. Their responses were evasive. Judge Wu Zehan ordered them to be remanded in custody and scheduled another hearing for further investigation.</p>

<p>Public Criminal Cases Not Handled by the Court</p>
<p>Yesterday was Christmas, celebrated by European and American countries, commonly known as the Foreign Winter Solstice. Foreign officials and merchants in the city all took a day off to hold grand Christmas celebrations. All departments of the Municipal Council also ceased operations. Therefore, yesterday morning and afternoon, all police stations under the Police Department did not send public criminal cases to the First Special District Court for trial. Although the court was scheduled to operate as usual on the anniversary of the Yunnan Uprising, due to the current national crisis, it was ordered to remain open. In the morning, the court only handled private criminal cases, which was relatively less busy than usual.</p>

<p>At 7:20 PM last night, a family surnamed at No. 569 Tongshou Lane, Datong Road, Xinzha Road, was having dinner when four robbers wearing dark blue cloth jackets and pants suddenly broke in through the back door. Each armed with a pistol, they held all the men and women in the house under surveillance, forbidding them to make a sound. One robber guarded the door, while the others ransacked the rooms upstairs and downstairs, looting at will. After about half an hour, they left with their loot. The victims checked their belongings afterward and found that they had been robbed of cash, jewelry, and other items worth over a thousand yuan. They immediately reported the incident to the Xinzha Police Station, which dispatched detectives to investigate and search for the robbers.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Yonghua Store Burglarized After Closure, Goods Worth 20,000 to 30,000 Gold Stolen <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Discovery Made After Half a Year of Closure</p>
<p>Thieves Possess Extraordinary Abilities, Police Intensifying Investigation</p>
<p>The Yonghua Department Store at No. 428 Xinqiao Street, Fadama Road, managed by Tan Huisheng, went bankrupt this summer due to financial difficulties. Creditors filed a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court, and the store was sealed. After half a year, the creditors reached an agreement with the store owner and requested the court to lift the seal so business could resume. The store owner first sent people to clean and tidy the store. However, upon inspection, goods worth 20,000 to 30,000 gold had been stolen. Shocked, they reported to the police, who dispatched Chinese and Western detectives to investigate. They found a large hole in the roof. They also found a large hole dug in the wall of the adjacent Yuantong Shoe Store at No. 91 Xinqiao Street, covered by a wooden cabinet. According to the shoe store owner, the front of the building was rented to a person surnamed Fang in September, who left behind old furniture and belongings last month without saying goodbye. Later, they received a postcard stating that the furniture was used to offset the rent. They then sublet the space to a person surnamed Zhang and were unaware of the theft. The detectives reported the situation to their superiors, who ordered them to apprehend the thieves for investigation. It was reported that when Yonghua Company sent people to clean the store, they also found a pot of freshly cooked rice in the kitchen stove, which had been eaten, and a quilt on the sofa. This indicates that the thieves had been occupying the store day and night, boldly selecting and stealing goods at will. Such a large-scale theft is unprecedented, and it is impossible for only one or two people to have committed it. The police are now conducting a thorough investigation to apprehend the thieves and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Gao Jincheng, a local, lived on Dapulu in the French Concession. Yesterday morning around 11 AM, Gao, along with his mother and wife, went to the China Hotel on Guizhou Road and rented a room to bathe. Around 1 PM, they left the hotel together. Gao had a bicycle, which he could use for transportation. He hired rickshaws for his mother and wife, while he followed behind. When the rickshaws reached Fuzhi Lane near Shantou Road, Guangxi Road, a robber suddenly emerged from the lane and forcibly tore off Gao's wife's gold earrings and fled into the lane. Gao's wife cried out in pain, shouting "Catch the robber!" Gao rode his bicycle and chased after the robber into the lane on Shantou Road. At that time, the robber was escaping from the same location. Upon seeing Gao, he turned back and ran away. Gao noticed a police officer nearby and reported the incident. The officer drew his gun and chased after the robber. As they approached Guangdong Road, the officer was very close to the robber. The officer ordered him to stop, but the robber continued to run. Fearing that he would escape, the officer fired a shot at the robber, hitting him in the leg and bringing him down. The original stolen goods were recovered, and the robber was taken to the police station. Due to the severity of his injuries, he was transferred to the hospital and will be dealt with after he recovers.</p>

<p>Qian Tanglao Caught Stealing Official Clothes</p>
<p>Chen Erlang, a resident of Meimen, who resided at No. 3 Jumei Lane, Bailinan Road in western Shanghai, earned his living working in a biscuit factory. On the morning of the 22nd of this month around 9 AM, while he was out shopping, he saw a man who often visited the Chen family, who were tenants on the same floor, carrying a large bag of clothes, hurriedly leaving the house. At the time, Chen Erlang did not think much of it, assuming he was a friend of the tenants. Unexpectedly, at 12 PM, Chen and his wife returned home for lunch and found that their clothes had been stolen. His wife cried out about the theft and inquired among the other residents. The tenants on the upper floor, surnamed Chen, had also had their silk and leather clothes stolen, totaling more than twenty pieces. Chen Erlang then told them what he had seen and learned that the man was named Qian Tanglao. They went together to Qian's place to investigate, but Qian denied everything. Chen Erlang went to various pawnshops nearby and found that two of the stolen clothes had been pawned at the Qiantai Pawnshop on Robert Road. Under Chen Erlang's name, they had pawned goods worth 15 yuan, and under the name of the tenant Chen, goods worth 25 yuan. They also confirmed that the clothes and appearance of the person were indeed Qian Tanglao. The tenant Chen felt that Qian was a fellow villager and friend, and his reputation was at stake. After Chen Erlang persuaded him, they immediately prepared the pawn money and redeemed all the clothes to put an end to the matter. Unexpectedly, the thief Qian Tanglao did not have the good fortune to enjoy his freedom. Instigated by his accomplice Liu Genliang, he went to the tenant Chen a few days ago to negotiate, forcing him to compensate the landlord Chen Erlang for damages to his reputation in an attempt to extort money. Chen Erlang felt that since he had witnessed him carrying the bag out and the pawnshop had confirmed it, he still dared to come back and extort money. When he loudly rebuked him, it happened to be when Team Leader Tang Bingxiang and Detective Zhou Wenhai from the Sixth District Detective Team were patrolling nearby. After inquiring about the situation, they apprehended the two thieves, Qian Tanglao and Liu Genliang, and took them back to the district. They also searched Qian's home and found the original stolen cash, 38 yuan (only 2 yuan had been spent), all with the pawnshop stamp. After questioning them separately, the district officer considered that the thief had stolen in broad daylight and then tried to extort money, which was truly despicable. He immediately prepared a document to send to the bureau for trial.</p>

<p>Jiang Fengyi, the warden of the Jiangsu Second Branch Prison behind the First Special District Court in this city, has been ordered by the Ministry of Justice and Administration to be transferred to the post of Warden of the Zhenjiang County Prison. The vacancy will be filled by Qiu, the section chief of the Nanjing Jiangsu First Prison, who will come to Shanghai to take over the position. The original Zhenjiang Warden will be transferred to fill the vacancy of Section Chief Qiu in the Jiangsu First Prison. Since Mr. Jiang took office as the warden of the Second Branch Prison in Shanghai in July of this year, he has actively improved the internal operations. When he took over, it was during the hot summer, and the prisoners were extremely crowded. After Mr. Jiang's planning, a temporary detention center was set up on Tiantong Road to alleviate the congestion. He strived for cleanliness in the prisoners' diet, hygiene, and medical care. As a result, although there were hundreds of prisoners, there were few reports of illness. The Second Branch Prison's work aspect for prisoners has never been well-developed. Since Mr. Jiang took office, he has urged progress, and it has seen a rapid increase, exceeding more than double. He also had clear rewards and punishments, not showing favoritism. He is truly a talented person in the prison industry, and Chinese and foreign people have praised him. This winter, fearing that the prisoners' clothing and bedding would be insufficient, he has donated more than one hundred sets of cotton clothes and dozens of cotton quilts from various philanthropists so that the prisoners will not suffer from the cold. Warden Jiang's dedication to prison administration and his guidance of prisoners to repent and reform are truly worthy of public service. It is regrettable to hear that the transfer is imminent. Good officials do not last long. It is also heard that Mr. Qiu has been ordered and will soon come to Shanghai to take over the position.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Ministry of Education Explains Regulations for Secondary School Graduation Examinations <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Regulations for Examination Committee</p>
<p>—Instructions to the Jiangsu Education Department—</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Education Department submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for clarification on ambiguities in the regulations for secondary school graduation examinations and the rules for the examination committee. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education instructed the department, stating, "We have received your submission. We will now address the questions you raised point by point as follows: (1) If secondary schools under the jurisdiction of education departments or bureaus in various provinces and cities have classes that begin in the spring, graduation examinations must be held twice each year. Students who repeat a grade may participate in the subsequent examination. Therefore, repeating a grade twice is equivalent to repeating one academic year. If parents are unable to bear the cost or students do not wish to repeat the grade again, the original school may issue a certificate of completion. (2) Senior high schools are permitted to admit students with equivalent academic qualifications, as explicitly stipulated by the Ministry in the secondary school regulations. There is no need to reiterate this in the examination regulations. Junior high school students who fail one or two subjects may use their equivalent academic qualifications to take examinations for higher education. (3) Graduation examination passing certificates are not graduation diplomas. The school’s certificate will be produced by the department and issued within two weeks after the examination for students who pass to use for applying to higher education. As for graduation diplomas, they should be marked with the words 'Examination Passed'. After verification and stamping by the department, they will still be issued by the original school. (4) Members of the examination paper setting committee and the proctoring committee must not be appointed from the faculty and staff of schools participating in the examination. Please comply accordingly."</p>

<p>Jiang Tingfu Does Not Recommend Qualified Students for Overseas Study</p>
<p>Zhu Yanfeng States Reasons to the University President's Council</p>
<p>(Special Dispatch from Beiping) The first graduating class of Tsinghua University's graduate school, having been reviewed by the faculty and deemed qualified to graduate, has been recommended to the President's Council in accordance with Article 14 of the graduate school's charter for approval to be sent abroad. These include Lu Xueshan, Shao Xunzhen, and Shao Xunge. Zhu Yanfeng, a graduate of the current class of the graduate school, is involved. For this selection of students to be sent abroad, the Ministry of Education ordered that five students be sent. However, only four students meet the requirements of Article 14 of the graduate school's charter, including Zhu Yanfeng. According to the charter, he should also be sent abroad. He has twice appealed to the President's Council and University President Mei Yiqi. The President's Council has now replied that because the director of studies, Jiang Tingfu, did not approve him, his request is still not approved. The entire faculty and student body is tense about this. Our reporter made a special trip to Tsinghua University to investigate, and the situation from all sides is described as follows:</p>
<p>Inside Story of Sending Students Abroad This year's selection of graduate students to be sent abroad by Tsinghua University is based on Article 14 of the graduate school's charter, which states, "Graduate students with a three-year grade point average of 1.05 or higher, and with graduation examination and thesis scores of 'Superior' or higher, may be recommended to the President's Council by the department head." This year, there are six graduate students, but only four meet these three criteria. The Ministry of Education ordered the university to send five students. Beforehand, the general opinion within the university was that the number of students sent abroad would be either five or four, and certainly not three. The history graduate school has two graduates, Zhu Yanfeng and Shao Xunzhen, whose grades both meet the standards for recommendation. According to the charter, they should both be recommended to the President's Council by the department head. However, the department head, Jiang Tingfu, did not recommend Zhu Yanfeng. When Zhu questioned Jiang, Jiang said that the charter states "may be recommended," which also means "may not be recommended," so he has the right to decide. In order to uphold the law and protect students' rights, Zhu had no choice but to appeal to the President's Council for an interpretation of the charter. The President's Council replied, "Regarding the recommendation of graduate students with 'Superior' or higher grades to the President's Council, the Council discussed it last week and generally agreed that the procedure should be subject to the department head's review. Not all students with 'Superior' or higher grades must be recommended to the President's Council." Therefore, there is still no resolution.</p>
<p>Zhu Yanfeng's Petition For the matter of application, I have learned that graduate students to be sent abroad have already been recommended by each department to the President's Council. However, I was not nominated by the history department head, which surprises me greatly. I have checked my grades, and they are sufficient to meet the recommendation criteria, but I have not been recommended. I do not know the reason for this. I have sent a letter to Director Jiang Tingfu, requesting a remedy. According to Director Jiang's statement, this is a matter of interpreting the law. Since the graduate school charter states "may be recommended" by the department head, that means the department head may also "not recommend." Therefore, the director has the power to decide. However, if the president or the President's Council believes that there is another interpretation and a supplementary recommendation is required, then it can be handled accordingly. According to the opinion of most students, the phrase "may be recommended by the department head" should be interpreted as follows: the opposite of "may be recommended" is "may not be recommended," not "not recommended." "Not recommended" is the opposite of "recommended." "May be recommended" is said in continuation of the preceding text, meaning that only if the grades meet the "may be recommended" standard can the director "may be recommended." Otherwise, the director "may not be recommended." Therefore, "may be recommended" and "may not be recommended" depend on the student's grades, and not on the arbitrary decisions of one or two individuals. In other words, it should be based on objective judgment and pursue what is right. Therefore, although the word "may" cannot be said to be equal to "should" on the surface, it actually contains the spirit of "should." If the grades reach the legal standard of "may be recommended," then the director has no legal reason to believe that he "may not" recommend them. I sincerely hope that the president and the council will uphold justice and correct the history department head's misunderstanding, so that I may receive a supplementary recommendation. I am most eagerly awaiting a response. Respectfully submitted to the President's Council and President Mei. Student Zhu Yanfeng respectfully submitted.</p>

Whether this method is feasible is currently being consulted with the Ministry of Education.</p>

<p>Those with excellent facilities and complete curriculum</p>
<p>—May be approved to graduate in two years—</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 25th) The Ministry of Education issued a circular to all provinces and cities on the 25th, stating, "The Midwifery Education Committee previously submitted a request to order subordinate senior midwifery schools to set the length of study to two years. However, the Vocational School Law and Regulations promulgated by the Ministry stipulate that all senior vocational schools graduate in three years. Midwifery schools are of great importance to the health of mothers and infants. Most schools do not have perfect facilities and curricula. Therefore, three-year graduation should still be the standard. If senior midwifery schools in each province and city have excellent facilities and complete curricula, they may be approved to graduate in two years after approval by the Ministry. Please forward this to your subordinates for compliance."</p>

<h3 id="e188">Zhejiang Provincial Library Prepares Cultural Relics Exhibition <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>Celebrating the 30th Anniversary of the Library's Founding</p>
<p>Exhibition of Fine Books, Rubbings, Pictures, and Other Cultural Relics</p>
<p>—December 30th to January 3rd—</p>
<p>In recent years, the Zhejiang Provincial Library has been quite effective in improving facilities and increasing readership. At the same time, it has also been committed to preserving documents and promoting scholarship. Now that the library has reached its 30th anniversary, in order to commemorate the past and encourage the future, it has been decided to hold a 30th anniversary celebration on December 30th. In order to expand viewing and promote scholarship, a cultural relics exhibition will be held for four days from the next day to January 3rd of the new year. The preparatory situation is described as follows:</p>
<p>The founding of the Zhejiang Provincial Library can be said to be at the forefront of the trend in various provinces. The allocation of the Siku Quanshu (Complete Library in Four Sections) of the Wenlan Pavilion 150 years ago (Qianlong 47th year) allowed scholars to view and copy, which opened the precedent for modern libraries. Later, during the Taiping Rebellion, the pavilion was destroyed and the books were damaged. The old rules were restored only after Ding's collection and repair and Tan Fu's construction. However, this was still a special system, and the transmission was not widespread. It was not until the 29th year of Guangxu (1903) that Zhang Hengjia, the Zhejiang academic administrator, at the request of the gentry of the county, founded the Zhejiang Library, hiring Yang Fu as supervisor, widely collecting new and old books, and formulating reading and borrowing regulations, which is the power of today's provincial library. It has been 30 years since then. In order to commemorate the past and encourage the future, the library has decided to hold a 30th anniversary celebration on December 30th, and a cultural relics exhibition for four days from December 31st to January 3rd. The content of the exhibition will focus on fine books, supplemented by rubbings, pictures, ancient artifacts, calligraphy, etc., and special attention will be paid to items related to the sages of this province. Sources of exhibits In addition to various books and rubbings from the library's collection, rare items are also being collected from collectors in the provincial capital. Among them, the fine book section includes the Song edition of Famous Ministers' Tomb Inscriptions Wan Yan Collection recently purchased by the library, old Song, Yuan, and Ming editions, various manuscript copies of Siku Quanshu, Yongle Encyclopedia, and essential books from all sides. The rubbing section includes rubbings related to the anecdotes of this province and other rubbings, Han and Wei stone carvings rubbed by the Shandong Library, rubbings newly purchased from Beiping, and rubbings of calligraphy printed by the Chunbei Ge Tie Stone recently collected. The picture section includes various paintings, cultural relic photos, and exquisite illustrations from British and German documents. The National Art College also has art books in its collection participating in the display. Artifacts and calligraphy are displayed as attachments, and many volumes and albums of inscriptions and inscriptions related to the sages of this province have been collected. In order to highlight the achievements of predecessors and show the progress of the past 30 years, a special library history exhibition is set up to display various old archives and souvenirs. Although the library is unable to expand the scope due to the unstable situation and the heavy workload, it only started preparing one month ago. However, in order to broaden the knowledge of all sectors of society, it deeply feels that the rare books in the collection are too few, so it plans to collect items from collectors in the provincial capital. Yang Fu, Yu Shao, Song Sunjun, Gu Bainian, Wang Xiu, Fan Zhen, and others have responded, and the items from the Wang family in Changxing are the most numerous. According to the exhibition, exhibitions are often held in Pingjin. Exhibitions on cultural relics are rare in the south. The Zhejiang Provincial Library held a Ding Songsheng cultural relics exhibition last autumn to commemorate Ding Songsheng. Now, taking advantage of the library's anniversary, there is this cultural relics exhibition, which is enough to set the tone for Hangzhou. The time coincides with the New Year, and not only will various agencies and schools in the provincial capital be on holiday and easy to visit, but also people from Shanghai can take a short trip to the lake during the holidays and have the opportunity to visit at the same time.</p>

<h3 id="e189">University Education Association Initiates the Organization of a Thrift and National Salvation Association <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>And Issues a Declaration on Thrift and National Salvation</p>
<p>The Shanghai University Education Staff Union, including Chu Minyi, Zhang Shouyong, Weng Zhilong, Zheng Hongnian, Yan Fuqing, Li Denghui, Hu Puan, Kang Xuanyi, Lin Zhongke, Lei Guoneng, Zhang Jixin, Qiu Hanping, Jiang Zhensan, Chen Jilie, Long Tiyao, and more than 40 others, initiated the organization of a Thrift and National Salvation Association, which was unanimously passed by the tenth joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees. The declaration is recorded below:</p>
<p>Declaration of the Thrift and National Salvation Association Since the September 18th Incident, the Northeast has fallen, and Pingjin is in danger. The people of the country are heartbroken, and the national crisis is urgent. Everyone is thinking of ways to save the country. However, the efforts to resist aggression have been repeatedly launched and defeated. The reason for this is that there has been no sufficient preparation in peacetime (once an emergency occurs, we rush to meet the enemy with flesh and blood, facing sharp weapons. The success or failure is known without the need for wise people). The enemy is advancing step by step, getting an inch and wanting a mile. Everyone understands that they will not be satisfied with what they have already obtained today. America's three-year naval construction plan and Russia's construction of fortresses and deployment of troops along the border are all based on the fact that our country has lost thousands of miles of territory within two years, and the violent invasion has no end. They are also indirectly threatened and cannot but actively prepare for national defense and consolidate their surroundings. Recently, an agreement has been reached between the United States and Russia to join hands to prepare for the earth-shattering storms in the Pacific Ocean in the near future. The United States and Russia are known for their strength in the world. Once they feel an indirect threat, they rush to catch up, fearing that they will not be able to do so. However, looking back at our country, which is weak and directly impacted, what is the state of its national defense?</p>
<p>Preparing for National Defense is Primarily About Economy The ultimate source of the economy lies in the people. Therefore, enriching the national economy is the primary task of saving the country today. As for the methods, they are nothing more than two aspects: increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. However, the way to increase revenue is extremely difficult, and long-term plans cannot be done in a moment. However, reducing expenditure is easy, and all of our people, if they are determined, can implement it and achieve results at any time and anywhere. The undersigned is not talented, but wants to start with the negative reduction of expenditure to gradually move towards the positive increase of revenue. This is the origin of the Thrift and National Salvation Association. The simple method is to save our unnecessary expenses to enrich the general national economy, so that the majority of the people do not feel the pressure of life, so that everyone has spare strength to engage in the path of saving the country. However, the way to reduce expenditure is extremely complicated and difficult to list one by one. What the undersigned is paying attention to is</p>
<p>The Most Superficial and Simplest Things It is not to say that these few things have exhausted the way of thrift. After all, strict thrift is not something that everyone can bear. Now, we first choose a few things that everyone can abide by, and use them as broad creeds to promote them. If they are effectively implemented, the results will be considerable. As for those who can be more frugal and thrifty outside of this creed, they are the ones that the undersigned prays for most earnestly. Furthermore, the way of thrift should not only be actively carried out after the current national crisis, but also should be advocated in order to eliminate the root causes of future national crises. In today's society, extravagance is the norm, and competition is for vanity. The salaries of public officials often do not cover their expenses. As a result, bribery and corruption are heard of every day, and the spirit of integrity is completely swept away. How can we purify the officialdom if this is the case? Furthermore, in the case of ordinary citizens, due to the temptation and constraints of the extravagant environment of society, life is becoming increasingly difficult. Those who commit crimes are increasing day by day, and society is becoming increasingly decadent, with no hope of revival. Because of the corruption of politics and the decay of society,</p>
<p>Its Impact Extends to the Countryside For thousands of years, the countryside, which we have relied on as the source of life, is now in danger of bankruptcy. As a result, from large cities to remote villages, no one is not suffering from the pressure of life. Finance is exhausted, and purchasing power is decreasing day by day. The existing industries and businesses are struggling to survive, and the development of new businesses is out of the question. If this continues, even without foreign aggression, it will be difficult to maintain ourselves. How can we avoid the side-eye of our strong neighbors? Based on this, our task of thrift is not only to cope with the current national crisis, but also to correct future bad habits to establish a stable national foundation. Its organization should be long-lasting, and its scope should be broad. We hope that our fellow countrymen will not hesitate to give instructions and actively participate, so that everyone can easily lift the weight, and the country and society will be fortunate. The association's constitution is omitted for brevity.</p>

<h3 id="e194">The County Education Association Urgently Seeks to Develop Rural Education <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>Submitting Proposals to This Year's Education Administration Committee</p>
<p>Promoting Women's Education and Designating Leader Schools</p>
<p>Zhang Yi, representative of the Shanghai County Education Association, has submitted many important proposals to this year's Education Administration Committee in order to develop the county's education. The original proposals are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Promoting Women's Education Proposal for Promoting Rural Women's Education (Reasons) According to a recent survey, the number of literate people in rural areas accounts for 16.3%, and the number of illiterate people accounts for 83.7%, especially women. Therefore, rural women's education is extremely important. Looking at the people's schools that have been established in our county, the number of female students is always less than the number of male students. Without special facilities, it is difficult to promote it. A proposed method is used to request a public decision. (Methods) Train teachers for rural women's education, set up special women's schools, and focus the curriculum on daily use, such as textile sewing, knitting, medicine, literacy, and bookkeeping. Borrow village houses as classrooms, equip them with application tools, and ask for special assistance if the teachers are not capable enough.</p>
<p>Determining the Education Center Proposal for Determining the Education Center for the 23rd Year (Reasons) If the national education bureau does not have a definite center, then the thoughts of its citizens will inevitably be scattered. Regarding the current situation of the national society and our county, it is very urgent to develop people's livelihood and enrich national power. It is up for public decision whether to determine the education center for the 23rd year as the place for production education. (Methods) The county education bureau should invite experts to formulate an implementation plan, submit it to the province for record, and carry it out effectively.</p>
<p>Designating Leader Schools Proposal for Designating the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Districts as Leader Schools (Reasons) The central system in the first and second districts of this county has already been implemented. Due to the relationship between education funds and the environment in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, no central schools have been established. In order to seek joint education and promotion in one district, it is necessary to designate leader schools. (Methods) The county education bureau should select a school from the existing schools in the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts as the leader school and formulate methods to jointly promote the work when things happen.</p>

<h3 id="e198">Yesterday, Jiangda Football, Jiaotong, and Fudan Won <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>Jiaotong Defeats Jinling 4-1</p>
<p>Fudan Defeats Central 3-0</p>
<p>—Only Remaining Match in the Entire Schedule: Jinan vs. Fudan—</p>
<p>The Jiangda football tournament, with the Central and Jinling universities coming to Shanghai to compete, has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday, the two teams played against Jiaotong and Fudan respectively, and both visiting teams suffered crushing defeats. As a result, Jiaotong defeated Jinling 4-1, and Fudan defeated Central 3-0.</p>
<p>Jiaotong Defeats Jinling. The match was held at Jiaotong University at 2:30 PM. Jiaotong's entire line was well-organized and extremely aggressive. Although Jinling also had strong players, under Jiaotong's attack, Jinling was seen to be faltering. After a quarter of an hour, Jiaotong's Zhou Guangzhong scored the first goal. Afterwards, Jiaotong's offense became even more fierce, constantly harassing Jinling's territory. Zhou Guangzhong scored the second goal, and Wen Liandong scored the third. The first half ended there. In the second half, Jinling tried to rally, but the situation was still unbalanced. Although Jiaotong had several more opportunities, they all missed. Jinling resisted strongly, launching several counterattacks. Finally, with only one minute remaining, Lin Jianxue scored a goal for Jinling, avoiding a complete rout. The lineups were as follows:</p>
<p>Jiaotong University:</p>
<p>Fan Jiaju, Chen Gongyu, Li Beiliang, Wan Xianghua</p>
<p>Wang Changying, Shen Guanlan, Gong Yibin</p>
<p>Zhang Jinrong, Zhou Guangzhong</p>

<p>Yu Mingchu, Zhang Zhaoxiang, Chen Shikai</p>
<p>Jin Huaili, Li Jianzi, Ren Shaowei</p>
<p>Liu Zuxiu, Zhang Zhaoxiang, He Xueyao</p>
<p>Fudan Defeats Central. The match between Fudan and Central was held at the municipal stadium in the city center. The field was flat and wide, with thick grass, comparable to a baseball field. The match was quite intense, with both sides having opportunities, but neither scored. Fudan's strength was originally quite formidable, but they were unable to win for a time. The first half ended without any goals. After the break, Fudan rallied and was determined to win, while Central suddenly found itself struggling to defend. The enemy's presence was dense in front of their goal. Fudan raided and pillaged, with extremely rampant momentum. Finally, Yu Shunzhang scored two goals in a row. Although Central tried to counterattack repeatedly, their forward line felt weak, and they were limited by Guan Laoye's impregnable defense, with no opportunity to take advantage of. In a renewed effort, Fudan's An Lesheng also scored a goal, defeating Central 3-0.</p>
<p>Fudan University:</p>
<p>Li Zhonglin, Guan Xun'an, Li Bingcheng, Wang Wenjing</p>
<p>Zhang Rong, An Lesheng, Feng Nianhan</p>
<p>Li Changchi, Yu Yuanzhang</p>
<p>Zhou Fuwen, Lu Xiuwen</p>

<p>Discussion of the Championship Situation. The competition schedule is coming to an end. After Jinan defeated Jiaotong 1-0, achieving five wins in five matches, their hopes of winning the championship are very high. Currently, the only remaining match in the entire schedule is Jinan vs. Fudan. If Jinan does not lose, even if the match ends in a draw, they can secure the championship. The situation for each team is as follows:</p>
<p>Team Name, Matches Played, Wins, Draws, Losses, Points</p>

<p>China Scores Three Consecutive Goals in the Second Half to Reverse the Defeat</p>
<p>West United Suffers Defeat Due to Lack of Cooperation Among Star Players</p>
<p>Auction of Football Raises a Huge Sum of 500 Yuan</p>
<p>In yesterday's inaugural match of the Shenyuan Football Field, a Sino-Western charity football match, the Chinese team defeated West United 4-2. Over ten thousand spectators cheered and danced with joy. The Chinese team defeated the West United All-Star team, and although the Chinese team was trailing 1-2 at the end of the first half, they were able to rally in the second half and score three consecutive goals, reversing the defeat and winning the McKinley Silver Cup. Mayor Wu personally attended the opening ceremony and performed the ceremonial kickoff. After the match, Mayor Wu auctioned off the football to raise money for charity. Mr. Gu Liren of Yuyuan Road generously donated a huge sum of 500 yuan to purchase it, setting a new record for charity football match auctions. His righteous and courageous actions are commendable.</p>
<p>Intense Battle with Few Highlights. Both sides were the elite of Chinese and Western football, and their performances were naturally top-notch. However, due to injuries and other commitments, Wan Xianghua was unable to play for the Chinese team due to the Jiangda competition, so the Chinese lineup was not at its best. West United was assembled on short notice, and cooperation was difficult, so there were not many highlights. However, the battle was intense throughout and was still interesting. The Chinese team was behind in the first half and was under constant attack, so it was already in a dangerous situation. After scoring in the second minute of the second half, they made it 3-2, and the dangerous situation turned into jubilation. West United launched a fierce counterattack but eventually ran out of steam, and the situation went from intense to tiring. In the last five minutes, Li Yichen's goal brought excitement to the otherwise dull situation, creating a perfect ending.</p>

<p>West United's Defeat Was Unexpected. Due to the incomplete Chinese lineup and the fact that West United was made up of elite players, the pre-match predictions were worrying for China. Some even said that the result would be a huge 4-0 or 6-2 score. However, the opposite happened. West United's defeat can be analyzed as follows: too many defensive errors, weak right midfield, and a complete lack of cooperation among the forwards. Xu De and Tao Lehui did not pay attention to the flanks and made too many mistakes. For example, the fifth goal was Xu De's mistake. Stoke was not good at playing as a winger in midfield, and his contribution yesterday was too little. Among the forwards, the wingers were slow and unable to cooperate with the two famous players Maolin and Aqiao from Vasas. As a result, cooperation broke down. Walter could not run, and Willie's passes all went out of bounds. In terms of individual performance, Smith stood out, and goalkeeper Herbert made many saves.</p>
<p>Chinese Players Deliver Satisfactory Performance. Looking back at the Chinese team, it was not easy to achieve this result. Careful play and full effort were the main reasons for the victory. The performance was also unexpected. Goalkeeper Xu Heng is improving day by day. The two defenders had some minor flaws, but they were not a problem. Midfielder Xu Yahui is still a star, and Chen Zhenxiang was able to cope and worked very hard. Among the forwards, right winger Chen Jiaqiu was the most outstanding, dominating his side. Although Sun Jinshun has iron legs, his shots were not on target. Dai Li's shots were just as good. Gu Shangkuang, who switched from defense to wing, cannot be said to have been derelict in his duties, but he was a little slow.</p>
<p>West United Opens the Scoring with Bluster. After Mayor Wu performed the ceremonial kickoff, the Chinese team kicked off. The ball was passed far to Jiaqiu. West United countered, and Aqiao shot. It was saved, and Gu Shangkuang advanced fiercely on the left. Tao Lehui made two mistakes, but both were unsuccessful. The Chinese team still had many chances to attack. Once, Jiaqiu passed the ball to Linjing, who was about to shoot but did not succeed. Yichen intercepted the ball and shot at the goal, but it flew wide. Dai got a pass from Jiaqiu and shot at the goal again, but Herbert caught it and slipped, still not scoring. West United countered, and Keleite shot from the right. Xu Heng caught it and bounced it out, and Aqiao slammed it into the net. It was already half an hour.</p>
<p>Pulling Back a Goal and Then Conceding Again. After losing a goal, the Chinese attack was fierce, surrounding the enemy's goal and applying great pressure. Jiaqiu got help from Yahui, and Yichen came to attack the goal. Xu De turned around and sent it out, but the ball did not go far. Sun Jinshun shot again, but Stoke, who was useless, actually had an effect at this time. The ball happened to bounce off Stoke's body and then bounced off the goalpost. Otherwise, it would have gone in. In the melee, Chen Zhenxiang sent a long kick, which cleared the danger again. Five minutes later, after Sun Jinshun was offside, Li Zaichen passed to Gu Shangkuang, who passed it back to the center. The Chinese center then scored with one shot. Just as one wave subsided, another rose. Walter advanced on the left, and the ball went to the right area. Li and Jiang, the two defenders, were momentarily stunned, and Keleite attacked unprepared and gently deflected the ball. Xu Heng thought it was out of bounds, but it happened to go into the goal. The first half ended there.</p>
<p>China Rallies and Scores Repeatedly. In the second half, Aqiao and Smith immediately started a fierce attack. The defense cleared the danger, and the Chinese players were seen to be active again. Gu Shangkuang got the ball and went straight in. Xu De came to block, dodged past, passed to the center to Dai, and then Li Yichen took it into no man's land and rushed into the goal. Within these two minutes, the score was tied. The Chinese team rallied from this, and their morale soared. Both wings were very active, and West United was in a very difficult situation. Five minutes later, Li Yichen got a pass from Sun Jinshun and scored again, making it 3-2 and taking the lead. Cheers erupted.</p>
<p>At the End of His Rope, Dai Scores Again. West United then paid attention to defense. Smith monitored the Chinese center Dai, never leaving his side. Leimi also retreated and did not come out, switching from attack to defense. The forwards became increasingly isolated and useless. At the end of his rope, they were completely desperate. In the last five minutes, Jiaqiu attacked the goal. Li rushed up to head the ball and collided with the goalkeeper. The ball was punched out, and Xiao Dai followed up with a shot, making it 4-2.</p>
<p>Auction of Football Raises 500 Yuan. After the match, Mayor Wu and Mr. Geli Mu Xu, chairman of the Westerners' Association, gave speeches, encouraging the players in the field and thanking the guests outside the field. After the speeches, Mayor Wu presented the huge McKinley Cup to Chinese team captain Sun Jinshun. After the cheers of ten thousand people, Wu held up the football and stood on a chair, auctioning it off in a loud voice. Just as the value was being discussed, land merchant Gu Liren stepped forward to purchase it. His bid was 500 yuan, and no one in the entire field contested it. It was settled, exceeding the ball price of last year's charity competition by 300 yuan. It can be seen that the level of concern for charitable causes among the people of Shanghai is indeed advancing day by day.</p>

<p>Quanquanxing vs. Nanyang Competing</p>
<p>Since the Zhenxin Cup Table Tennis Tournament began, it has entered the finals stage. Nanyang, with its momentum from three consecutive victories, will play Quanquanxing again tonight. Although they possess Deng, Huang, Wang, Gu, and Wang, five tiger generals, Quanquanxing's Hua Yihong and others are all famous players of the time, so the outcome is still difficult to predict. It is expected that when the two teams meet, they will go all out to compete and predict who will win the championship.</p>

<h3 id="e210">San Francisco Sino-Japanese Rugby Match <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Team Loses 12-13</p>
<p>Old Grievances Unresolved, Overseas Chinese Do Not Support the Competition</p>
<p>Organizer Heavily Criticized and Will Leave to Avoid the Situation</p>
<p>(Havas, San Francisco, 24th) In the rugby match held here between the Chinese and Japanese teams, the Japanese team won 13-12. Historically, there has been a match between the Chinese and Japanese teams every year, but it was suspended after a brawl in 1930. Today, very few overseas Chinese attended the match. Chinese team leader Mr. Lin announced that the Chinese team's defeat made him feel ashamed and that he planned to leave San Francisco immediately. He also said that only 18 of the Chinese team's thirty-odd members agreed to participate, and the overseas Chinese in the city refused to provide assistance. One of the Chinese team members, Mr. Long, a former University of California player, claimed that the game was originally a draw. Although the Japanese team was dominant after the start, the Japanese were leading 13-6 two minutes before the end of the game. At this time, the Chinese team counterattacked and scored a try, thus regaining six points, making it 12-13. According to the rules, each team can kick the ball after scoring a try. If this kick is successful, one more point can be scored, resulting in a tie. Unexpectedly, the Chinese team's final kick, although it fell on the goal line, the referee did not make such a judgment, causing the Chinese team to lose by one point.</p>

<h3 id="e211">Bump <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Only Via</p>
<p>The red-headed Asan dodges three zhang high, wielding the red and green traffic lights at the crossroads. Thus, trams don't bump into cars, horse-drawn carriages don't bump into field cars, and rickshaws don't bump into bicycles. Although the road is like a tiger's mouth, country folk carrying hobnailed shoes and umbrellas can still walk safely and avoid the danger of "bump".</p>
<p>"Bump" is the most dangerous thing in the world, because the results of a bump are always unspeakable and unmentionable.</p>
<p>The soft bumping into the hard is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, overestimating its ability. Therefore, smart people don't take immediate losses. From afar, seeing a fast-moving car, they stand on the sidewalk and wait for the car to pass before crossing the road. Seeing someone raising a stick to hit people, they still run away as early as possible. Those who play with pens have to give way to those who play with guns, because pens are made of bamboo, and guns are made of iron, with a big difference in hardness. These are all "compasses for avoiding magnetic fields".</p>
<p>In fact, the "compass for avoiding bumps" doesn't need to be promoted, it's already well-known to everyone. And even if the soft inevitably bumps into the hard, or doesn't have time to avoid it, and has to bump, at most, the soft will have a bloody head and broken bones. It doesn't affect the public. So what is extremely worrying for social security and the future is nail heads bumping into iron heads, hard bumping into hard.</p>
<p>Bombs are hard, and soil is soft. If a bomb falls into the soil, the soil shows a big hole, and everything is fine. But if a hard bomb falls on a hard cement building, without politeness, the bomb explodes, the building collapses, and people and livestock are destroyed together. This is the terror of hard bumping into hard.</p>
<p>Patrols catching hawkers, hard sticks bumping into soft flesh. If the soft flesh avoids the hard stick, there will never be trouble. Patrols catching robbers, everyone has hard guns and bullets, and no one is willing to avoid that hard bump. Under this bump, both sides are hurt, which is naturally expected, and it is not impossible for innocent pedestrians to be sacrificed under this bump. Therefore, we hope that bandits disappear, so that when we walk on the tiger's mouth-like road, we have to avoid "bumping" into cars and horses, and also be careful of hard stray bullets bumping into us.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Dream <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Chuan Zhaoyang</p>
<p>Dreams are great and unbelievable. In dreams, we can be the winner of a 500,000-dollar lottery; I can kill the enemies we hate in dreams. If we feel that life is too bland, dreams can give us a tortuous and strange world. If we feel dissatisfied, dreams can give us 120,000 points of satisfaction. Dreams are sacred!</p>
<p>Because dreams have such benefits, no one doesn't want to dream. Everyone tries their best to dream. They can sacrifice wealth, people's respect, their own morality, and even their own lives to seek the satisfaction of dreams.</p>
<p>However, we all know that dreams will not continue to infinity. There will always be a time when dreams wake up. The satisfaction gained in dreams will become a movie after waking up, disappearing in an instant. But people always pursue dreams like that.</p>
<p>China is a world of dreams. No one in China is not living in a dream. They want to become rich; they want to be important people; they want to immerse themselves in happiness. They forget the sadness when they wake up from their dreams, they only care about some tiny pleasures in their dreams.</p>
<p>Bombs cannot wake up the Chinese people's dreams; artillery shells cannot wake up the Chinese people's dreams. It seems that as long as there are dreams, the Chinese will be so satisfied, and nothing else matters.</p>
<p>However! Dreams always wake up! Let go of those poor pleasures in dreams! Let's not wake up only after the enemy's guns are aimed at our chests!</p>

<p>Chapter 20: Fortune-telling Brings Smiles to the Old Man's Face for Days; Endless Worry Remains with the Old Friend Across the Street</p>
<p>Guizhi finally realized what was happening and said with a smile, "I noticed your face was sallow and thin like this, and you're always sick, so I got anxious in my heart. It's really just making a fuss, does getting anxious make the illness go away?" Madam Jiang smiled and said, "Oh! You understand that yourself, then I don't need to say more." Guizhi suddenly thought to herself, "I should cheer myself up." So she scooped a basin of hot water and washed her face clean. Besides applying a layer of snow cream on her face, she also took out two long-unused rouge blocks from the drawer and applied two red blushes to her cheeks. She combed her hair neatly, curving the short hair that covered her face behind her ears and securing it with small hair clips. When she looked in the mirror again, her face was radiant, with no sign of illness. To make herself look presentable, she simply took off her blue cloth jacket and changed into a clean one. Madam Jiang, seeing this from the side, thought she was going out, so she said, "That's right, it's good for you to take a walk around the block, so you don't get sick from being cooped up." Guizhi smiled and said, "I'm not going anywhere. I'm afraid people will see me and think I'm not sick, so I just washed my face." Madam Jiang said, "It's good for you to go out for a while. People who sleep too much should get some fresh air." Guizhi also felt flustered and bored, and since her mother had said so, her feet took her to the front door without her own control. But as soon as she reached the front door, the Gan family's gate was directly in front of her, and she was immediately startled. Originally, she was going to walk on the road towards the Gan family's gate, but then she turned her face away and walked in the other direction. After walking a few steps, she unconsciously sighed and shook her head, saying, "It's really a curse. Why can't I let him go in my heart?" She walked forward step by step, looking at the road under her feet. She could almost distinguish every clump of grass and every stone. Occasionally, she looked up and saw a young man in a worn Western suit, wearing a wide-brimmed felt hat slightly askew. He held a thin bamboo cane in his hand, swinging it from side to side in front of him, walking with uneven steps, also looking very bored. Guizhi suddenly stopped and exclaimed, "Huh?" The man also suddenly looked up, and they met each other's gaze. It turned out to be Gan Jizhi himself. She wanted to avoid him, but she ran into him. Darn! Isn't this a case of enemies meeting on a narrow road? (277)</p>
<h3 id="e215">The Tumbler <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Qian Xuecun</p>
<p>"Tumbler, the old man does not fall; nod him, he rises; push him, he does not fall."</p>
<p>These few lines are what I read in elementary school; but now, thinking back, they have a very profound meaning.</p>
<p>Speaking of the tumbler itself, it is a wax shell toy made for people to play with. However, you should not therefore despise it; it has a kind and pleasant face, no matter how people bully it, it will never be angry, always smiling. It is completely a philanthropist, and it can also be said to be a great statesman. In particular, when people nod it, then it nods, but rises immediately after nodding; when people push it, it leans to the side, but it does not fall. In this way, it is also a hero; it can bend and stretch, and has an indomitable spirit of fearlessness, just like the martyrs and generals of ancient and modern times, both domestic and foreign.</p>
<p>As for China, it has hundreds of millions of square miles of area, which is thousands of times better than the tumbler's wax shell. And China always treats people with a kind and pleasant face. No matter how other countries bully it, it is always kind and still smiling at people. From this point of view, China is a great charitable country; but it cannot be called a great political country. However, when people nod it, then it sleeps for a long time; when people push it, it falls and cannot get up. In this way, China is a coward, how can it have the ability to bend and stretch like a tumbler, and the indomitable spirit of fearlessness?</p>
<p>Alas! Can it be that China is not as good as a tumbler?</p>
<h3 id="e216">Copper Coins and Silver <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Yiyi Guan Zhu</p>
<p>"Copper coins and silver," who doesn't like them? Although, some people keep saying, "Copper coins and silver should not be taken too seriously," which is true. But, strangely enough, the more people who say "copper coins and silver should not be taken too seriously," the more their eyes will widen and bulge out when they see "copper coins and silver." What is the reason for this? Some people say: this sentence "copper coins and silver should not be taken too seriously" is originally "words of sarcasm" spoken to others! If they say this to themselves as well, and really take "copper coins and silver" lightly, then I am afraid it would be a little difficult to find such a fool in this materialistic world, even with a lantern and a broken foot warmer lid!</p>
<p>Originally, what do all living beings do? To put it bluntly, it is still for "copper coins and silver!" "Poor people" who have no "copper coins and silver" certainly cannot relax their grip on "copper coins and silver," and even dream of them. Look, all year round, all day long, on the roads, those who cannot take cars, or those who are walking, come and go, who is not busy for "copper coins and silver!"</p>
<p>As for "rich people" who are rich in "copper coins and silver," they should, in principle, be able to stop chasing after profit. However, it is not so, they still have to be busy, and even busier! On one hand, the abacus beads are rattling away, all day and all night. On the other hand, their minds are filled with the idea that "the more copper coins and silver, the better." Naturally, people like this take "copper coins and silver" so seriously that if you ask them to take some out to do charitable and public welfare work, forget it! Because they swear that they would never think that once they leave this world, no matter how precious "copper coins and silver" are, they will never go with them! That is to say: they are left to their children and grandchildren, and the result is that they only provide their children and grandchildren with the means to choose evil and do wrong! Then what is the point?</p>
<p>Alas! But, in this chaotic world, how many people can see through this point?</p>

<p>— Tian Hensheng</p>
<p>Fifteen years ago, Li A'quan's five-year-old daughter, Xiaoling, was betrothed to Yu Mingfa's seven-year-old son, Longsheng, through the matchmaker Jiang Si'die. After the Jiang and Yu families agreed to the engagement, Mingfa invited Zhu Changchun, who ran a millet shop next door, to be the assistant matchmaker because matchmakers had to come in pairs.</p>
<p>At that time, Li A'quan was very poor and relied on an old boat that was about to fall apart as a tool for making a living. The family of three lived on that old boat, and everything was simple and crude. In terms of food, even the bowl for serving rice had a chipped edge, and they couldn't afford a new one. In terms of lodging, they didn't even have a mattress, only a quilt that was patched with countless patches inside and out, and the cotton batting had many holes, making it stiff and offering little warmth. The three of them covered themselves with the quilt during the nights on the vast water, and before winter even arrived, the cold wind mixed with the chill of the water directly entered the cabin, already causing them to shiver. Before A'quan's parents died, there were three rented rooms on land, and there was more than one boat. A'quan's father didn't often personally sail out. He only needed to rent out a few boats to others, collect some rent, and that was enough for the family's expenses, with plenty to spare. Unexpectedly, his parents died one after the other, and a fire burned down the three ancestral rooms. He had to sell the boats; when he sold until he was left with only the last old boat, he had to rely on it to make a living, so he endured not selling it, preferring to suffer the harassment of the lien holders and his own lack of food and clothing. So A'quan started his career on the water, loading and unloading goods for others, sometimes east, sometimes west, without a fixed route. Since his daughter Xiaoling was engaged to the Yu family, he wanted her to be raised in their home as a child bride. He thought that his daughter would eventually belong to someone else's family, and since he was so poor now, why should he let her suffer? Moreover, his boat was used to load and unload goods for others, and having a child was inconvenient. His motivation for asking Jiang Si'die to be the matchmaker was to have her raised in the Yu family's home after the engagement, to spare his daughter from suffering and to ease his parents' worries, as living on the water was not as safe as living on land, and children were prone to danger. However, after the engagement was made, when he asked Jiang Si'die to express his wish to the Yu family, the Yu family refused to raise her as a child bride. At the same time, Xiaoling's mother suddenly couldn't bear to let her only darling leave her, and she was a little resentful of the Yu family's refusal to raise her as a child bride. After some time had passed, someone rented his boat to transport hundreds of bags of flour, and the matter was dropped.</p>
<p>A year and a half later, A'quan's boat finally returned to his hometown. He went ashore to see his new in-laws, Yu Mingfa, and was kept by his new in-laws for a drink and a meal. They talked about what had happened since their last meeting, and it wasn't bad. Although A'quan was illiterate, he was a very straightforward person. He told Mingfa that he had prepared the ten silver dollars he borrowed from Wang Changxing, as well as other small debts, and was ready to repay them. He didn't necessarily have to return home this time, but he did so to pay off these debts, and to meet his in-laws and see his new son-in-law. Indeed, he was very fond of this son-in-law and specially brought a few toys from afar, and gave him a silver coin when they met. As a result, the mother-in-law was also happy. The next day, he also went to meet the two matchmakers, Jiang Si'die and Zhu Changchun; he took money to repay his debts everywhere; he didn't even have time to visit a few relatives, and on the third day, he sailed away again. This time, it was more than two years before he returned, and his circumstances were about the same as they were two years ago.</p>

<h3 id="e218">A Brief Discussion of Heroes <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Fengzi</p>
<p>Since the beginning of history, China has had heroes in every generation. And they are certainly able to reshape the times, so the ancients said: "Heroes create the times."</p>
<p>This is probably true. When the world is in great chaos, there must be evil-doers, and the great achievement of destroying the evil-doers must be attributed to the heroes. Therefore, after Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong, there had to be a Qing Emperor who quelled the bandits, conquered the Ming dynasty, and pacified the Central Plains, so the people "brought baskets of rice and jars of drink to welcome the royal army."</p>
<p>What is being welcomed with "baskets of rice and jars of drink" is usually the royal army, and the royal army is still the same group of killers. The one who commands this royal army, needless to say, is the hero.</p>
<p>The hero leads the royal army, mightily marching into the pass, not only killing for a while, but also sowing seeds, ready to kill for generations to come. The Han people truly deserve to be "bearing the burden of humiliation" subjects, they don't mind a few deaths. Moreover, killing is the hero's natural duty, and the dead are still fated to suffer.</p>
<p>Those who are fated to suffer are certainly supposed to die, and those who are endowed with killing skills are said to have some background. Therefore, heroes mostly belong to celestial stars. Stars like Ziwei, Wuqu, and Baihu, as long as their mortal hearts stir, they will be sent down to the lower realm to be heroes for a time. Therefore, ordinary people are just ordinary people, and the conditions for being a hero must be innate.</p>
<p>Once the term of exile is over, the celestial stars return to their positions. Then another batch comes down.</p>
<p>However, the Chinese people mostly do not admire contemporary great men, but like the heroes of previous dynasties. Luo Tong's great battle with his intestines hanging out, Wu Song single-handedly capturing Fang La, and even the Black Whirlwind, wielding two axes, killing his way into Jiangzhou City, hacking at everyone he met, regardless of officers, soldiers, or civilians. Speaking of it, it always feels somewhat satisfying, as if there were no bloody scenes at all. But Luo Tong and Wu Song lost their lives because of this: the Black Whirlwind killed for a while, but still had to escape to Liangshanbo. Only the Qing Emperor killed with such grandeur, and not only was he not harmed, but he actually benefited. It can be seen that it is possible to be a hero, but the method must be carefully considered. The one who paid the most attention to the method of being a hero was Cao Mengde. He specially ran to an astrologer to ask for advice. The astrologer knew that he was a great hero, but added that he was "a capable minister in times of peace, and a great hero in times of chaos." Mengde also knew that it was a chaotic time at the time. His heart couldn't help but be very happy. Jin Shengtan probably missed a point, because this was probably "setting the stage" for the later discussion of heroes while boiling wine.</p>
<p>In addition, there was Huan Wen, who said "If I cannot leave a good name for a hundred generations, I will leave a bad name for ten thousand years."</p>
<p>But what I am talking about is the Qing Emperor.</p>
<h3 id="e219">On Criticism <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Shiheng</p>
<p>Recently, there have been quite a few articles discussing criticism in magazines or newspaper supplements. But summarizing the opinions in these articles, they are generally nothing more than this: it is hoped that critics will not speak out of personal emotions, but should only discuss the work itself, and even more so should not use criticism as a weapon for personal attacks. The opinion expressed implicitly in such articles is that, although there is great dissatisfaction with the current critical articles, there is also a very strong hope for criticism, for fair criticism that can satisfy people. This can be said to represent the opinion of the majority of people - no one does not hope for this.</p>
<p>The fact that writers or readers feel very disgusted with the current criticism and cannot help but complain about it is the responsibility of the current critics. However, in today's Chinese literary world, the objective conditions for the emergence of better critical articles are insufficient. I think that those who write critical articles should also bring this up for general complainers to refer to.</p>
<p>First, it is most unfavorable to criticism to generally regard personal attacks and scolding as criticism, and then criticize criticism, because this view is likely to make people develop an incorrect view that there is originally a category of scolding in criticism, and the scolders themselves also think that they are doing criticism. As a result, the more scolding there is, the less criticism there will be. Secondly, shouldn't we reflect on whether we have been indirectly encouraging scolding in the past critical world while welcoming it? - Looking at the past critical debates, we cannot help but say that the more tasteless and scolding they are, the more people like to participate in them, come to watch the battle, and the more meaningful ones, everyone keeps silent. And even some people, although they are constantly scolding on the one hand, are also criticizing criticism and criticizing scolding criticism on the other hand! The scolders and the critics of criticism have formed a unified body, and the result is that we only see the destroyers of criticism and cannot find the builders of criticism.</p>
<p>Furthermore, although true criticism is currently in the minority, it cannot be said to be absolutely non-existent: why don't we take these as topics for discussion, and instead only talk about those criticisms that we do not think are criticism? Ignoring true criticism and only taking scolding criticism as a topic, makes true critics feel lonely and makes scolders more active, which is tantamount to rewarding scolding.</p>
<h3 id="e220">The Street Performer <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Lengjia</p>
<p>Having found an empty abandoned square, the street performer put down the magic tricks he was carrying on his shoulder, put down the old-fashioned weapons in his hand, and also put down the child he had depended on for several years.</p>
<p>He had been wandering in the world since he was young, until his forehead was covered with wrinkles from life. He watched his wife die, his daughter run away with someone, and he himself fell from the position of selling medicinal plasters by demonstrating boxing skills to making a living by performing magic tricks and wielding weapons. Every time he thought of this unhappy life, the street performer's heart would ache faintly.</p>
<p>"Chang! Chang!" The street performer struck his only one-handed gong, and the sound of the gong carried the wail of his life. The rhythm was tragic and desolate.</p>
<p>More and more people gathered to watch the fun, and finally formed a large circle.</p>
<p>Standing in the center of the circle, the street performer routinely clasped his fists, speaking the formal greetings of the trade. He had said those words countless times, and they were almost memorized by heart. Every time he re-chewed those words, his heart would be saddened. How difficult it was to get rid of the burdens of life!</p>
<p>Performing martial arts alone in front of the audience, the street performer's heart was lonely. At the same time, the rust on the weapons aroused his sadness even more: this seemed to symbolize his real life. The glorious era of shining was over, and what reality had left him was only this rust. He thrust the weapon into the ground, and a desperate cry almost burst out of his mouth.</p>
<p>After performing all his skills, the reward he received was only some contemptuous "boos." No one threw down a single copper coin. In such a situation, the street performer had no choice but to swallow his anger, dragging the weapon back to the place where he had put down his props. The thought that "old and faded things are worthless" quickly flashed through his mind, causing him to completely lose the courage to open his mouth and beg for money.</p>
<p>After this initial failure, he then had the child take the stage. The child was only eight or nine years old, very short, but used all his strength to swing his fists and feet, and clenched his teeth to do somersaults, tiger jumps, and standing on his hands. Watching the underage child risking his life to perform tricks for the sake of survival, tears began to well up in the street performer's eyes.</p>
<p>However, the desires of the onlookers were satisfied. They treated other people's pain as a kind of pleasure. If this child could bleed to death in front of them due to overexertion, then they would definitely throw copper coins like crazy. Just because he wasn't quite at that point yet, although the cheers were loud, only a few scattered copper coins were thrown down.</p>
<p>In order to get a few more coins, and also in order to satisfy the audience's cruel psychology, the street performer began to order the child to strip off his upper body in the cold wind, lie on a large vat used for magic tricks, and he himself held a rusted green dragon knife, using the back of the knife to hit the child's back heavily. The back of the knife was thick and cold, and every time it hit, the child would let out a painful groan, and the skin on his back would turn from white to red to purplish. Immediately, the audience all screamed "good!" and copper coins rained down on the ground. However, the street performer seemed not to see it. He only felt that the back of the knife in his hand was not hitting the child, but his own heart. Every time it hit, his heart felt as if it had been cut with a knife, and it was so painful that it was unbearable.</p>
<p>As it got dark, the audience gradually dispersed, and the street performer ended the scene with his familiar set of formal greetings. He contentedly collected the copper coins on the ground, reloaded the props on his shoulder, held the weapon in his hand, and the other empty hand stretched out involuntarily, caressing the child's injured back as he was putting on his clothes.</p>
<p>"You've worked hard! Child, let's go!"</p>
<p>After saying these few short sentences, the tears that had been hidden in the street performer's eyes for a long time finally couldn't help but roll down his cheeks.</p>

<p>— Junzhi</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>During the Jiajing reign, there was a Jinshi named Zhu Dashao, who loved to collect books, especially Song dynasty woodblock editions. Once, he visited an old family in Wumen, which had a Song edition of Yuan Hong's "Later Han Records," which was a hand-annotated copy by Lu Fangweng, Liu Xuxi, and Xie Dieshan. He very much wanted to obtain it. Unfortunately, the other party would not sell it, leaving him helpless. Finally, they managed to reach an agreement: he would exchange it for a beautiful maid. This maid could write poetry. Before leaving, she wrote a poem on the wall:</p>
<p>Without reason, I am given up from my deep chamber,</p>
<p>It is still better than when people in the past exchanged horses;</p>
<p>If we meet again in the future, do not be sad,</p>
<p>The spring breeze will blow away the roadside branches.</p>
<p>Dashao, after reading this, felt regret, but for the sake of the Song edition book, he had to "give her up." This matter is seen in "Xun Zhi Tang Za Chao," and Lei Gong once quoted it in his work "Nen Wo Bi Ji."</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Zhu Yizun (Zhuzhai) was also a book lover. He once did a very interesting "stealing copy" thing. That was because Qian Muzhai had many secret manuscripts copied by hand, which he took with him wherever he went and did not easily show to others. Zhuzhai had repeatedly tried to get them but failed. One night, Muzhai went to a banquet outside, so Zhuzhai took advantage of this opportunity to bribe Muzhai's "page," "opened the lock and placed dozens of copyists in a secret room in advance, and they copied it in half a night, and then returned it." Of course, this matter was later exposed. The matter of Zhuzhai's "stealing copy" was therefore spread all over the north and south of the Yangtze River.</p>

<p>— By Maupassant, translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>"No, my child, that's impossible. It would condemn both of us to hell. I've tasted that punishment for the past month. You're moved now, but when that emotion passes, when you look at me the way 　er looks at me, when you remember what I've told you... Ah... my little Zhean, just imagine... just imagine I'm your mother!..."</p>
<p>"I don't want you to leave me, Mother, you're all I have."</p>
<p>"But, my child, you must think about how we'll never be able to look at each other again without blushing, I'll feel ashamed to death, and your eyes will make mine droop."</p>
<p>"That's not true, Mother."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes, it is true! Ah! I understand all the inner turmoil of your poor brother, all the inner turmoil from the very first day. Now, when I hear him come into the house, my heart leaps as if it will burst through my chest, and when I hear his voice, I feel like I'm going to faint. Back then, I still had you! Now I don't have you either. Ah! My little Zhean, do you think I could live with both of you?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Ah! How is that possible!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is possible."</p>
<p>"How can you expect me not to think of this when I see the two of you? Will you not think of it yourselves, you two?"</p>
<p>"Me, I can swear!"</p>
<p>"But you will think of it every moment of every day."</p>
<p>"No, I swear to you. Besides, listen to me: if you leave, I will kill myself." She was simply terrified by his childish threat, she embraced him, caressing him with passionate tenderness. He went on to say:</p>
<p>"I love you more than you can imagine, much more. Come on, don't be silly. Just try staying for eight days and see. Will you promise to stay for eight days? Surely you can't refuse me that request?"</p>
<p>She placed her hands on Zhean's shoulders, straightened her arms, and grasped his arms, saying:</p>
<p>"My child... let us be calm, not emotional. Let me speak first. If I ever hear you say the things I've heard from your brother's mouth this past month, if I ever see in your eyes the meaning I've seen in his eyes, if I ever sense from a word or a glance that I am as hateful in your eyes as I am in his... an hour later, do you hear, an hour later... I will leave and never return."</p>
<p>"Mother, I swear to you..."</p>
<p>"Let me speak... for a month now I have been suffering the pain that one person can endure. From the moment I understood that your brother, my other son, was doubting me, and that he was guessing the truth minute by minute, every moment of my life has become a torment I cannot explain to you."</p>
<p>Her voice was so heavy with sorrow that Zhean was infected by her pain, his eyes filled with tears.</p>
<p>He wanted to embrace and kiss her, but she pushed him away, saying:</p>

<h3 id="e224">Securities Lack Chips, Bond Market Squeezed Higher <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Consistent Increase of 4-5 Jiao to 1 Yuan, 3 Jiao, 5 Fen</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, because the futures for this month only had two days left, those on both the long and short sides with insubstantial positions, although not numerous, experienced a more intense short squeeze than before. During the squeeze, chips did not diminish in their tendency to be squeezed due to their small quantity. This was because in recent days, many of the long positions rolling over had been fully 　 prepared. The short side had demand, but there was little supply, leading to a sense of depletion of chips. The shortage of gold futures in July, when a shortage of 20,000 to 30,000 units raised the off-exchange price to 72 yuan, served as a grim reminder. Therefore, the short side's covering became increasingly difficult the later it was done. This is a situation often seen during a short squeeze. Yesterday, in terms of news, there was not much progress or retreat in the war situation. Since the central government ordered Qiao Min of Fuzhou to withdraw, the war gradually entered the main force battle, entering the third act period since the warlord uprising. Yesterday morning at the opening, most of the activity was helping the short side to cover, and long positions rolling over were rare. Chips suddenly appeared scarce, and market prices increased consistently by several jiao to one yuan. Before the second session, various items in the front row continued to rise by 3-4 jiao due to demand. The back rows fell slightly by 3-5 jiao due to some short selling. There were also many temporary sellers. In the afternoon, because Zhang Ji and others arrived in Shanghai and reported satisfactory results, people's hearts remained firm. Only grain fell slightly by 3-4 jiao, while the rest continued to rise by 2-3-4 jiao. At the close, various groups had sporadic needs, and the short side covered later, market prices increased again consistently by 3-5 jiao, and the upward trend was likely to continue. As a result, market prices increased consistently by 4-5 jiao to 1 yuan, 3 jiao, 5 fen. Trading volume totaled 19,282,000 yuan, including 2,000 yuan in spot goods, futures excise salt tax totaled 6,720,000, 　　accounting for 3,390,000, 19th period totaled 2,370,000, 20　20 open totaled 3,250,000, gold short 　6　 accounting for 2,100,000, and the rest ranged from several tens of thousands to 300,000 to 400,000. Today is the last day for December futures.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Yarn, Cotton, and Standard Yarn are Quiet <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market is quite sluggish, because the end of the year is approaching, all industries are 　 in the midst of closing accounts, and the market situation presents a dismal picture. Customer sales are being done for 3-4 days, and procurement is becoming clearer. In addition, the military situation in Zhejiang is still tense, and people's hearts are particularly weak. Fortunately, this month there is an organized company limiting purchases to 170 yuan, so the market atmosphere is still able to be stabilized.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Human Standard Continues to Fall by 4, 5, 6 Jiao <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The human standard pre-market opening was due to unfavorable current affairs news, and the sales of existing yarn were extremely sluggish, so there were few transactions. Each month fell by 1.2.3.4 jiao. The afternoon market situation was still quiet, and each month fell by another 2.3.5 jiao. Total turnover for the day was 7,700 bales.

<p>The Zheng Standard pre-market opening was due to the suspension of foreign cotton trading, with very little buying and selling, and each month fell by 5 fen.

<p>(Hu Nan) Yesterday, the sources of various groups were only more than 40 numbers (more than 6,000 shi), of which late accounts were even less, but the package stomach went slightly. Although the customer group stopped working due to the customs closure, those who opened the store moved to handle more than 1,000 packages, so the late rice market situation was slightly able to turn fixed, and the market price did not rise or fall much. The various groups of thick glutinous rice have achieved a balance between arrival and sales, but because people's hearts are not firm, the market color seems to be soft in the fixed, Duyang tip is slightly affected by the customer tip, the general situation is still difficult to stand, Bian Yin Yuan, because the zero stomach and wine households have adopted, the situation is slightly transformed,</p>
<p>(Hu Bei) Yesterday, there were more than 60 sources from various roads under the river, and various destinations in the market were very dull, white glutinous rice, early thin rice showed a slightly tired trend, and Yin Yuan, Bian Yuan, and Du Bu Xian were all in a stable pattern.</p>

<p>The soybean market continues to not rise, and general dealers are also taking advantage of the situation, and the market has fallen by another 5 or 6 fen. Downstream goods have fallen to 3 yuan 12 jiao. It is expected that this kind of market price will be slightly adjusted. However, the downward trend of the above-mentioned medium-grade goods makes people feel uneasy. Yesterday, Shantou dealers took more than 100 bags of Zhengyangguan soybeans, priced at 3 yuan 5 jiao 7. More than 400 bags of Zhengyangguan soybeans were traded in this street, priced at 3 yuan 5 jiao half to 5 jiao.

<p>Statistics show that silk cocoon mortgages have reached about 10 million yuan</p>
<p>Foreign firms' silk sales are in a slump. Silk mills in Jiangsu and Zhejiang have accumulated large stocks of silk that cannot be sold. Due to the need for expenses, they have temporarily mortgaged their remaining cocoons and silk to banks and pawnshops. Statistics show that this has reached about 10 million yuan.</p>

<p>Kulun is a commercial center in Mongolia. The tea trade there is controlled by Russians. In recent years, Russian merchants in Shanghai and other ports have handled Zanxi green tea and floral brick tea, which are sold to Mongolia, amounting to no less than 100,000 dan. However, this year, more than 60,000 dan of Japanese green tea have been transported to Mongolia by Russians. The reason is that green tea is expensive, while Japanese tea is cheap and can be completely purchased on credit. In the future, various types of green tea, such as Zhuang Gongxi Yuanzhu, will be greatly affected.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Actively Investigating and Prohibiting Fake Tea in Wenzhou <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>Eradicating the bad habit of adulteration and fraud on one hand</p>
<p>Improving production and sales methods on the other hand</p>
<p>In recent years, our country's tea exports have gradually decreased, and prices have also been declining. Tea farmers have found it unprofitable, and the bad habit of adulteration and fraud has become increasingly prevalent. Farmers in the Pingyang area of Wenzhou annually export fake tea, which, according to investigations, amounts to about 2,000 dan. Although most of this fake tea is sold domestically, it has a significant impact on the reputation of tea in an invisible way. In view of this, the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in addition to prohibiting the export of several batches of tea that were found to be fake this year, also notified the Zhejiang Construction Department to strictly prohibit local officials. On the one hand, it also notified Chinese and foreign tea merchants in this city to pay close attention. At the beginning of this month, it also took advantage of the opportunity of Mr. Lu Yunfu, who was sent by the Rural Reconstruction Committee of the Executive Yuan, to investigate the tea industry in that area, and entrusted him to conduct a thorough investigation. After Mr. Lu arrived in Wenzhou, he immediately went to Beigang, the central area of fake tea production, with Magistrate Zhang of Pingyang County to carry out publicity. The local people have all expressed regret. At the same time, he ordered the tea merchants in the area to organize a tea industry association, which must automatically prohibit fake tea production from next year, otherwise, they will be severely punished. According to Mr. Lu's investigation report, there are many types of fake leaves adulterated in that area, among which the leaves of cold danxin, liujing, hongchaixin, camellia oleifera, and loushanning trees are the most common. The method of prohibition is to passively prohibit it on the one hand, and on the other hand, to continue to find ways to improve production and sales, so that tea farmers can have profits to make, then fake leaves can be eliminated invisibly.</p>

<h3 id="e258">Talking About Tolerance <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Tu</p>
<p>Tolerance is something the Chinese have always admired.</p>
<p>Although there is no teaching in history to turn the other cheek after being slapped on the left, proverbs like "let it dry on your face after being spat on" have long been spread as admirable stories. This kind of tolerance is unique to the Chinese.</p>
<p>But it's not the same in foreign countries. There are few people who can be so generous, let alone have such great magnanimity, and it can be quite petty. Just look at the recent ban by the Dutch East Indies government on the import of firecrackers from our country to know. The reason for restricting imports is said to be because most of them contain powerful gunpowder, which is very dangerous (the original text can be found in the report on March 21).</p>
<p>Everyone knows that firecrackers are just a kind of toy. Although "most of them contain powerful gunpowder", the amount is limited. At best, they are only used to scare imaginary ghosts. I have never heard of firecrackers replacing artillery shells and grenades. Its colorful appearance and loud, impressive sound are not even feared by children. Moreover, most of those who set them off are Chinese, which has nothing to do with the economy of the Dutch East Indies. However, the Dutch East Indies government is so careful, thinking that it is "very dangerous" and restricting its import. If this is not because the foreign masters do not know the goods, then it is a matter of tolerance.</p>
<p>Looking back at our country, millions of "powerful gunpowder" guns are imported from overseas every year, but our general public, although living under artillery fire every day, seems to be used to it and does not feel "dangerous" at all about this huge annual import of murderous weapons, nor have they ever prohibited it. On the contrary, there are those who have offered their blood and sweat to provide capital for this trade for the general public. Hasn't the money and grain in Sichuan Province been pre-levied for more than sixty years of the Republic of China, and suffered four hundred seventy-eight or nine (according to Shanghai Weekly, the author has removed one digit, and there is a new record since the author stopped writing.) civil wars? Paying money to buy guns that "mostly contain powerful gunpowder" to fight wars, and even sacrificing one's own body as a target, isn't this tolerance big enough?</p>
<p>But there are also those with little tolerance. That is, those who play with guns and cannons often "cannot stand beggars asking for food". If they are not polite, they must compete. This is naturally said to be within the country. To the outside world, they will still return to the tolerance of "give them whatever they want". We are originally a nation that loves "peace"!</p>
<h3 id="e259">The Misunderstanding of Mr. Li <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>— Rain</p>
<p>It's only been within the last month that my friend Mr. Li has entered a passionate love life. Because an supreme authority has suddenly been established in his mind, his life is clearly more organized and richer than before. The usually messy front room has now become well-arranged; a vase with fresh flowers has been added to the tea table, sparse and well-placed pictures hang on the wall, and in the glass frame on the desk, his own shadow has been replaced by a smiling angel holding a flower. Even the pillowcases have been replaced with new ones, exquisitely embroidered with "My Dear" and initials as a shortened signature.</p>
<p>The complete makeover of the room unmistakably hints to anyone with a little bit of awareness that the owner of this house is undoubtedly "in love"!</p>
<p>One Saturday evening, Mr. Li kissed his beloved goodbye, full of joy, and returned to his apartment. The clock showed it was almost nine. He lit a cigarette, and as he leisurely smoked, he dreamily recalled the warmth and sweetness he had received from her throughout the afternoon.</p>
<p>The "tap-tap" of high heels grew louder and closer in the alley below, finally knocking on the door of his own apartment. The evening visitor did not arouse any attention in him. Because his beloved would definitely not come at this hour, and he had no other female friends who would visit at this time. He then heard the knocker talking to the maid downstairs, looking for "Mr. Li." However, this was not strange at all; there really was another "Mr. Li" on the second floor, but that "Li" was currently in the hospital getting his nose operated on.</p>
<p>But, tonight's visitor was beyond his expectations. The "tap-tap" of leather shoes went straight up to the third floor! With one further step, there was a gentle knock at his door. "Misty Li!"</p>
<p>"How strange!"—as he mentally drew question marks and exclamation points, he opened the door to greet the "unexpected guest."</p>
<p>"Whom are you looking for?" he asked as he greeted, sizing up the female visitor from head to toe. She wore a magenta serge skirt, with a flannel shirt, commonly worn by overseas Chinese students, tucked into the waistband. The round neckline revealed a smooth, fair neck. Her face was round, and although not very beautiful, the contrast of her clear, watery black and white eyes brought her "overall average" score to no less than seventy points.</p>
<p>"Is Misty Li at home?"</p>
<p>"He lives on the second floor, went to the hospital the day before yesterday. Is there anything I can..."</p>
<p>"Oh! He's in the hospital? Yes, he's always been weak and sickly..."</p>
<p>This friend surnamed "Li" knew that the female guest had made a "double booking" mistake, because he clearly knew that the Misty "Li" in the hospital was a "big guy" who was not "weak" at all. But he couldn't explain it directly, so he could only vaguely say a few words to send her on her way.</p>
<p>"He probably won't be back for a day or two. You can leave a note, or go to the hospital to find him tomorrow. The hospital is at..."</p>
<p>"Alas! I have something very urgent. I live in the Jiande Academic Society and owe six dollars in rent—we're all away from home, don't let your husband laugh at me—" (as she spoke, she forced a shy expression), "Today the servant refused to open the door for me! That Mr. Li used to promise to help me, but now he's sick, leaving me with a problem for tonight..."</p>
<p>"You can go to find him tomorrow..."</p>
<p>"But, tonight... Can you help me a little, sir?..."</p>
<p>"I'm very sorry! I only have fifteen coppers left!"</p>
<p>"Then... my accommodation problem tonight can't be solved! Could I borrow a room here for one night? I'm in trouble! Besides, you and I are both from high society, so male-female relationships are not a problem..." As she spoke, her facial expression gradually turned from "solemn" to flushed.</p>
<p>"This... originally it wouldn't be a problem, but, I am a married man. My wife teaches in Suzhou and always comes to Shanghai on Saturday evenings, so there's no way. I'm sorry..." he lied as he pointed to the photograph.</p>
<p>The strange female visitor pestered him from nine o'clock until half-past ten, leaving disappointed and empty-handed.</p>
<p>Filled with surprise, this friend surnamed Li went to find a friend surnamed Zhao who lived in the same alley, to tell him about tonight's "adventure."</p>
<p>"I know that woman, but I don't know her name. She used to 'pick up' old 'Lei' at the cinema. When old Lei left, she pestered old 'Li' at old Lei's apartment, asking him for money several times. Old Li avoided her in every possible way. Later, he ran into that woman on the street and blurted out that he had moved to 'No. 19, XX Lane'..."</p>
<p>"Oh no! No. 19, she's found me. I'm also an old Li!"</p>
<p>The next day, old Li met his beloved. "Darling! Thank you for the photograph. It has the magical power of 'Jiang Taigong is here, all gods retreat'..."</p>
<p>"What! Little rascal! Comparing me to Jiang Taigong? How unreasonable!"</p>
<p>When he told her about last night's "romantic encounter" nakedly, she couldn't stop laughing!</p>
<h3 id="e260">Referee Beaten Up Incident <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>The newspapers these two days introduce us to two good news; one is that the "Japanese Imperial Army" is again attacking Eastern Chahar, and the other is that a Jiangnan University Sports Association referee was beaten up by Jiaotong University students.</p>
<p>In this day and age, sports are particularly promoted, the king of balls is particularly prominent, and the appeal of ball games is more powerful than anything else. This is naturally due to the newspapers' advocacy, the educators' awards, which have created this vain trend. The beating of referees is precisely the result of this vain wind.</p>
<p>Once a year there is a Jiangnan University football match, and once a year there is a beating incident—either players are injured, or referees are beaten. Harming the lives of others is such a cruel act. Unfortunately, those future bachelors in the academy treat each other cruelly for a moment's vanity. The grand occasion of Jiangnan University's competition is just like that.</p>
<p>However, it is not right to completely blame the students for their barbarism. Those who run education take pride in promoting sports, and the school's equipment and students' studies are secondary. Winning a ball game is the most important thing, then, it is inevitable to buy players. The player's body is related to the school's honor, and he can be proud of himself and look down on everything. When it comes to the competition, he will naturally desperately try to win, otherwise, his value will be swept away, which is not worthwhile. Furthermore, the newspaper's publicity and the fans' devotion are also an enticement to the players to lift their chests and clench their fists.</p>
<p>Everything in China is developing in the wrong direction, and the whole society's heart is floating on the word vanity. The reason is that those who bear vanity can find a way to survive in this society. If a player wins a competition, he will be rewarded by the school, blown by the newspaper, and praised by the fans. That is a colorful, number one figure. Then, who wouldn't give his life for the battle, and who wouldn't take victory as the primary meaning! Naturally, those who are defeated will be frustrated, angry, vent, scold, and fight with fists and feet.</p>
<p>The occurrence of this kind of incident is naturally worthy of sighing for those who care, but I can briefly say that this is the end of the general public's pursuit of vanity, which is a phenomenon that is inevitably produced by the evolution of China's social environment. Educators should sigh when they see this incident, that China's education is bankrupt. But please ask the educators why they promoted the trophy competition, held swearing-in ceremonies, celebrations, etc., to motivate the enthusiasm of those players with the glory of "winning glory for learning"? The public opinionists also condemned this barbaric action when they saw this incident, but please ask the public opinionists why they are so enthusiastic about promoting vanity and publicizing the players' martial arts in such an extravagant way? Revolutionaries may be saddened by the nation's private struggles being too brave and public enemies being too cowardly when they see this incident, but, revolutionaries, what surrounds today's youth is all vanity, deception, and temptation. How can public anger arise?</p>
<p>Today's barbaric actions are full of the whole society. We cannot only blame the college students for being too barbaric. Today's education is all like this, and it cannot be said that education is bankrupt. Today, the psychology of the Chinese people is full of private fighting and anger, and we cannot blame these college students for being cowardly in the face of public enemies. If we want to blame, we can only blame today's Chinese society for being too bad, the society and the individual are separated day by day, the individual and the country are separated day by day, that is to say, the society, the country, and the individual have become three conflicting things that are manifested in today's Chinese real life.</p>
<p>In China, there is really nothing that is reasonable, that is holding the flag of justice. If we want to curse, we can only curse the entire society. Then, let us curse, curse those educators who buy players as "winning glory for the school"! Curse those public opinionists who encourage the general public to walk the path of vanity!</p>
<p>The referee who was injured should also be on the list of curses, curse him for being a puppet of vanity!</p>

<p>— Yiping</p>
<p>XX:</p>
<p>I bought a few books from the Commercial Press and came out, a car shining with electric light, illuminated by the sun, flew past me. Oh, XX, is that you? I almost shouted out. But the car had already headed north, a cloud of gasoline-smelling smoke still lingered in the air, two heads were printed on the rear window of the car, blurred, and finally nothing could be seen, only the smell of gasoline could be smelled.</p>
<p>XX, that gentleman sitting next to you is probably your husband. He has an awe-inspiring attitude, he has a car to ride in, in my few seconds of glimpse, his whole person is so lovely, your mother's pressure on you to marry him is fully justified, for your firm opposition at that time, almost letting go of a lifetime of good opportunity, I think you are too unwilling to plan for yourself.</p>
<p>Your mother only has you as a daughter, she is so clever in soliciting a good family with such suitable conditions for you, even if you don't plan for yourself, you have to understand the hard work of the old man. Do you know? The son-in-law has the reliance of half a son; if I were an old woman like your mother, the son-in-law in my mind might have more demanding conditions, otherwise I would rather my daughter be an old maiden, this is the lifelong event of a girl, not to mention that the mother still has the reliance of half a son!</p>
<p>The car has disappeared without a trace, and even the smell of gasoline has dissolved in the air. I am still staring at these few books and thinking about these things that have nothing to do with me. I am a man, and I will never have the psychology of a mother. Even if a man loves his daughter more than a mother does, I am an unmarried man, tens of millions of miles away from marriage, even if, to take ten thousand steps back (because my conditions are not suitable for every daughter's mother), a mother unexpectedly agrees to marry her daughter to me, but whether I can be a father to a daughter is something that no one can predict.</p>
<p>Returning to my small building, I stared blankly at the photo you gave me. I thought about it ecstatically. I regretted that I was not a daughter, I could hang up many conditions and solicit a companion for my lifelong event, like the gentleman next to you, he has an awe-inspiring attitude, he has a car to ride in, he is so lovely. Let my mother be happy and happy, he has a son-in-law with the reliance of half a son of that kind, after eating vegetarian food and chanting scriptures, wouldn't she smile wryly when she talks about it? Alas, I am a man!</p>
<p>The sky is gradually darkening, and things beyond a few feet cannot be seen in the small building. Your photos are also gradually blurring. I lean my head back and put my feet on the writing desk, learning the gentleman's demeanor and fantasizing, but unfortunately, there is a lack of a stylish cigar on the lips.</p>
<p>I am a man, and there is nothing I can do about it. However, I should have an awe-inspiring attitude, a car to ride in, so that people can see that I am so acceptable. I cannot make my own mother happy, but also make other people's mothers happy, and be a son-in-law with the conditions that are suitable for every mother's heart and with the reliance of half a son. However—I have nothing, only a man—a man who cannot make his own mother happy and other people's mothers happy!</p>
<p>So I felt sentimental. I, a man, was born into the world and have no benefit to anyone. I work every day, eat every day, for what? And it is so hard!</p>
<p>XX, you may think I am too "emotional," but I haven't heard the coquettish scolding of "emotional things" for a long time. Hey, probably, I am an "emotional man"!</p>
<p>Then I should work every day, eat every day, for the honorific title of the two words "emotion."</p>
<h3 id="e262">"Husband Who Pursues Stench"? <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>— Binfu</p>
<p>The weather is getting colder day by day, and people are all greedy for the warm bed. Who is happy to get up early in the morning to work? However, there are always people in the world who "do not enjoy happiness" and "do not know what is good for them." No matter how cold it is to "freeze the sky and the earth," every day when the dawn is just breaking, they loudly "ah—oh" to disturb the neighborhoods, which is exactly when people's sleep is the most intense! Not to mention the masters and mistresses, even Wang Ma and Zhang Ma are just about to close their eyes and rest. But they just have to "ah—oh" to disturb, which is undoubtedly what "the people in the quilts" hate, who are they? They are the workers who dump the chamber pots.</p>
<p>The workers who dump the chamber pots are men and women, old and young. Probably every manure cart is always paired with a man and a woman, one pushing and one pulling, and the relationship between this man and woman, father and daughter, mother and son, of course, exists, but the most common is husband and wife.</p>
<p>If the working hours of news reporters are at night, and the working hours of bank and foreign firm staff are during the day, then the working hours of the workers who dump the chamber pots are in the early morning after the night and before the day.</p>
<p>They crawl out of the quilts every day before it dawns, pushing or pulling the "chamber pot" cart to the street. The wife is barefoot, and the husband is also barefoot. The wife's chest is tied with the rope of the "manure cart," she puts her feet on the ground with force, and her body is prostrate parallel to the ground, using all her strength to drag; the husband's body is also bent parallel to his wife, pushing forward with force; sometimes maybe the husband is pulling and the wife is pushing. They go east and west like this, the husband shouts "ah," the wife answers "oh," to knock on the back doors of everyone's houses, to load the excrement of every household's men, women, old and young.</p>
<p>Don't the workers who dump the chamber pots have a look at love? Don't they have the same mood as the mistresses and masters to sleep a little longer in the warm quilt? What limits this mood is their duty, what forces them to</p>
<h2>Page 17</h2>
<p>them to this job is their life.</p>
<p>The disgust for excrement is the genius of human beings. Thus, it indirectly makes people not have a good impression of the workers who dump the chamber pots. If they unfortunately encounter a manure cart on the road, there is simply no one who does not reveal a look of "being horrified" and "going away in a sullen manner."</p>
<p>Are the men and women who dump the chamber pots all born "husbands who pursue stench"? Those who listen clearly should know that this is "not entirely true."</p>
<p>Their feelings are the same as the people all over the world, but under the whip of life, they have to do this against their nature.</p>
<p>"Excretion" is the natural result of animals. If they don't do this work, the consequences are really unimaginable—their work is difficult and hard, but their rewards are meager, how great they are—are they "husbands who pursue stench"? "Living in leisure without teaching" and only knowing how to speculate and profit are the real "husbands who pursue stench!"</p>
<p>Every time I see a couple pulling a chamber pot cart, I often admire and envy their spirit of cooperation, and I feel that a perfect family should be built on this spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Hungry for Whole Days and Nights of Rain <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>— Liehuo</p>
<p>Fortunately, during the January 28th Shanghai War, I didn't go hungry, but after the everlasting Shanghai Truce Agreement, I returned to my hometown and was hungry for two whole days and nights on the Xiang-E railway line. This is a page in my life that I will never forget.</p>
<p>On the night when the Eastern Ocean soldiers began to bombard Tiantong'an, I once again had a conflict and broke with Mr. Fang because of the harsh treatment. Mr. Fang also knew that it was impossible to recover—my wife and old master all advised me, but I still rolled up my quilt and wanted to leave, but unexpectedly, Mr. Fang's good friend Mr. Xi knocked on the door urgently downstairs.</p>
<p>Mr. Xi, like a snail, hurriedly turned up to the small building, and said in a mess without a head: "Mr. X, it's started, oh, it's terrible! Is Mr. Fang asleep? Is Mr. Fang asleep?" Before I could answer, Mr. Fang, whose sense of smell and hearing was as sensitive as a cat and dog, actually knew without error that his good friend Mr. Xi had come. Half of his oily head appeared at the door of the front厢房, and simply said these five words: "Mr. Xi, please come in!"</p>
<p>Mr. Xi went upstairs, and I re-evaluated my vague future. The Eastern Ocean soldiers are fighting, this, from the perspective of the entire nation-state, will undoubtedly overturn the ancestral graves of thousands of generations: but for me, it is always a good opportunity to escape this cage. The news is indeed very tight, and from now on, maybe there is no way to survive; however, I am confident that I can be a volunteer army. Old Qian has already gone, he will definitely introduce me, give up my life, and fight against Japanese imperialism, fight against all imperialism, I will definitely leave this prison, I have been wronged enough in the past year.</p>
<p>Just as I was evaluating this, Mr. Xi came in; "Mr. Fang sincerely asked me to come and keep you, the news is so tight, Mr. X, please stay, stay!" As he spoke, he unpacked my quilt, which was of course pointed out to him by Mr. Fang. In front of the unfamiliar Mr. Xi, I was a little embarrassed to turn my face, so I couldn't help but "um" vaguely. It turned out that Mr. Fang was standing outside the door, stretched his foot and stepped into the small building, smiling and saying: "Please forgive everything! Thank you for helping, helping!"</p>
<p>In this way, during the terrifying Shanghai War, fortunately, I didn't go hungry again. The truce was agreed, and traffic had returned to normal, so I carried out another form of prison escape, that is; asked for a month's leave to return to my hometown to visit relatives. Mr. Fang actually agreed, only saying that I must not exceed one month's leave.</p>
<p>On my long return journey, it was safe from Shanghai to Hankou. The terror was on the Xiang-E road. In order to hurry, I and Yun商定 agreed that we would take the train back; because taking a steamboat would take at least a day and two nights, while the train would not take a day. I still remember that the departure was at 7 pm in the evening, and it was scheduled to arrive in Changsha tomorrow morning, but unexpectedly, after driving out for two sections of small stations fifteen miles away, it turned back again. It is said that the coal and water were not enough, but some people said that there was trouble ahead. Later, the car still went out wanting to go in and retreat. When it arrived at Puzhi, it stopped moving forward, and suddenly there was chaos in the first and second class carriages, saying that the bandits were full of both sides of the railway, and a large number of wounded soldiers just rushed into our fourth class carriage. This is the suffering we must endure. Although the first and second class carriages are empty, the wounded soldiers are going to rush into our fourth class carriage, which is already crowded with people.</p>
<p>Let the blood and tears of the wounded soldiers flow, let the hoarse throats scream, they are ending the meaning of life in their dreams!</p>
<p>It stopped for two whole days. The usual hawkers who were too many did not know where they had gone. I got off the bus to urinate and found a corpse selling pancakes on the side of the road.</p>
<p>After being hungry for two full days and nights, we finally arrived in Changsha in terror. I didn't go hungry during the Shanghai War, but I suffered this scene after the truce agreement. Heaven or man?</p>

<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>(40) Now is not the time for our love</p>
<p>The letter read:</p>
<p>Brother,</p>
<p>To be honest, being in Shanghai for nearly a year has given me too much grief. My departure is also out of helplessness. Brother, I will always remember that now is not the time for love, especially since I am a woman who cannot marry.</p>
<p>Being oppressed by my uncle in the countryside was not something I could easily endure. I resolutely sacrificed my reputation and threw myself into the arms of Shanghai. But what has Shanghai given me? Although I myself have not fully implemented my set intentions, I also take a share of the blame. Brother, I am not a love-supremacy advocate who says that love is life. I also do not want to snatch you over as my prisoner; but I love you is a fact that cannot be hidden from you. On the train, in the hotel, and finally when we stepped into the Zhengyi Society together, you did not reject my love, which is also a fact that you cannot hide from me. As for Huixing appearing in front of us, I thought it was not worth competing with others, but I did not expect that a man's heart is so easy to change. Brother, I will always, always remember that now is not the time for our love, from your first sentence to your last sentence, so I left.</p>
<p>Women are inherently jealous. I think my departure may be judged with such an unwarranted accusation. I myself do not admit to being a woman, because I am too ignorant of the female nature of jealousy, I failed. Although I can do my best to snatch you over, I am confident that I have this confidence, but I am unwilling to do this kind of behavior that forces people to do what they don't want to do, because I am not a woman and do not have the inherent jealousy of women. And—brother, now is not the time for our love?</p>
<p>I am leaving, I will dedicate myself to work that is more important than love. The iron hooves of imperialism are eyeing people for devouring. I hope that the comrades of Zhengyi will work hard to achieve your set goals, or we may meet again in a certain place. Remember, I will say loudly to the comrades of Zhengyi Society: "Now is not the time for our love!"</p>
<p>Goodbye, brother, goodbye, comrades of Zhengyi Society.</p>
<p>"Good! I will never dream of being a woman again, now is not the time for our love!" Xiao Huang threw down the letter and stood up, posing with a serious face as if making a vow. "Our loyal comrade!" I patted his shoulder, and the matter about Sister Min had calmed down.</p>
<p>"Comrade!" He joined his heels and raised his hand, a military salute that could not be more natural to him.</p>
<p>"Now is not the time for our love!" I tore the letter to pieces and waved it in the air, and the paper scraps danced like butterflies.</p>

<h3 id="e265">Where is Charles Farrell Now? <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>— Guang Dao</p>
<p>He has returned to the screen to film new movies.</p>
<p>And a very valuable conversation.</p>
<p>A few days ago at the Grand Shanghai, I watched "Paddy the Next Best Thing" starring Janet Gaynor, alongside Warner Baxter. After watching, many people remembered Janet Gaynor's old partner of eight or nine years, Charles Farrell, and happily asked, where has Charles Farrell gone, since we haven't seen him for so long? Therefore, I think this news is what everyone is eager to know, so I will report his recent news and conversations.</p>
<p>According to recent news, Charles Farrell, after a long rest, has now returned to Hollywood and is starting to film again. His first film after returning to the screen is called "Aggie Appleby", produced by RKO. It is said that since leaving Fox, he has been unwilling to sign long-term contracts with any company. He is only willing to work if he has a good script. Otherwise, he would rather sacrifice financial income than shoot films casually. This is because he doesn't want to disappoint the audience. He once left Warner Brothers, and recently left Fox, because the company did not have satisfactory roles for him, forcing him to leave. Now that he has returned to the screen, he seems determined to uphold his principles, not to make bad films, and not to be bound by long-term contracts. Here are some recent remarks:</p>
<p>"I used to be too kind and too casual. That's why they all called me 'Easy-going Charlie'. But in Hollywood, that's a disadvantage. If you don't take yourself seriously, people won't value you either. To succeed in Hollywood, you must be like on a battlefield, establishing a front line." These are Farrell's thoughts. He has recognized his past mistakes. This time he returns to the screen with a fighting spirit. He also said: "I used to be too kind, without a defensive line to the outside world. This virtue of peace developed too much, leading to many drawbacks. I was willing to take on any role that others didn't want to do. So many other actors rushed ahead to compete for good films, and even bargained with the company, while I waited behind for people to choose. I took what was left without complaint. Over time, the company understood that Charles Farrell was an easy-going gentleman who was easy to please, and gradually they paid less attention to him."</p>
<p>This is the case with most things in the world. As for the virtue of peace and the spirit of humility, they are certainly good; but "too much is as bad as too little". Being too humble often invites humiliation. In the case of a country, the doctrine of non-resistance can lead to the loss of the country, which has already been proven. In the case of an individual, if a person is in society and only retreats and yields, without a spirit of progress, it is not a good thing either. So being too competitive is not good, and being too yielding is not good. Charles Farrell's words really contain many philosophies of social life. He also said:</p>
<p>"If I were a little stronger, regarded myself as a big star, and had a firm position when dealing with outsiders, not just talking about friendship, then the company would not dare, nor would they be willing, to give me the roles that others didn't want. I have seen many actors who are not as good as me achieve victory in disputes with the company. What's the reason? It is because the boundaries between public and private matters are clearly defined. Business is business, and emotions are not allowed to interfere." These words are not necessarily just for Charles Farrell, or a movie actor, but for anyone. As the saying goes, "Respect his appearance, and people will also respect him." Otherwise, if you look down on yourself, people will also look down on you.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e266">Review of "The Misleading Lady" <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Moore</p>
<p>"The Misleading Lady"</p>
<p>Movie authorities often like to use the word "banned" for publicity. This method of seizing the audience's psychology is naturally very effective, but in Shanghai, because there is a distinction between the concession and non-concession areas, there are often many films that cannot be shown in the concession areas, so they are shown in the non-concession theaters. Thus, "The Misleading Lady," which was banned by the concession authorities, was shown at the Shanghai Grand Theater, which had screened the famous Soviet films "Life" and "Jinshan".</p>
<p>In fact, in "The Misleading Lady", we cannot find any reason for it to be banned. It is just an ordinary romantic comedy. People at the end of the century, because they are aware that they have no future, and while they have not yet fallen, they try to entertain themselves as much as possible. The reflection of this mentality of "If I don't enjoy myself now, the days will pass" is the main reason for the production of general wine and women films. Naturally, because of various factual restrictions, even if they want to enjoy themselves as much as possible, it is still impossible. So they can only imagine all kinds of unexpected adventures. As for whether it is reasonable or not, they don't care, and only the unreasonable fits their fantasies. Needless to say, "The Misleading Lady" is like this. It is inevitable that they turn this kind of story into a comedy, because their creation of this story will not be written into a tragedy to make themselves miserable. As the saying goes, "Meet wine and laugh, how much can life be"!</p>
<p>Of course, in "The Misleading Lady", their boredom with life is vented, but this is not intentional.</p>
<p>Truly excellent old artists clearly understand their own destiny and cannot hide their sorrow. Others who are a little more ambiguous are not like this. The reason why there are more comedies and fewer tragedies in European and American films now is this relationship.</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert's success in "Cleopatra" was due to the guidance of a great director, but in "The Misleading Lady" it is much less successful. She is neither lively, nor does she have any facial expressions, but the play requires facial expressions everywhere.</p>

<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Christmas in Hollywood always feels too warm, like wearing a fur coat and sipping ice cream, but the reality is not entirely like that. Although the outside is bathed in warm sunshine, it is snowing in the house! Snowmen made of white cotton also appear with cars full of drunks.</p>
<p>When the chapel on Beverly Hills rings the Christmas bells, what strikes the stars are: gift boxes piled up like mountains from fans, and the sound of telephones ringing between parties, constantly ringing...</p>
<p>In addition, this year there is also a surprising box for evening banquets. This box is made of colored paper, with slender paper tubes hanging on both sides. If you pull the two ends of the paper tube hard, there will be a "pop" and a military hat with "Hero Napoleon" written on it will fly out, followed by a doll's head wearing the military hat, with a cigar in its mouth. Then, with another "pop", a card with "This year's La, Falentine" written on it pops out. The guests around laugh like "idiot's laughter", ha ha ha...</p>
<h3 id="e268">Extra Edition of "Flame of Youth" <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>— Santa Claus</p>
<p>Performed at the Carlton at the end of the year</p>
<p>And send autographed photos of the stars</p>
<p>The colleagues of Tianyi Company elected "Flame of Youth" as the champion work of 1933, which is indeed the company's effort. The film was sent to Beijing for review after it was completed last month. It has now been reviewed and has been shipped from Beijing to Shanghai. It is now scheduled to be premiered at the Carlton Grand Theater on the 29th of this month. The performance of the star Chen Yu-mei in the film has a special breakthrough. Ms. Chen considers it to be her proud work. Director Qiu Qixiang also made many amazing contributions. The suggestive hints are also very wonderful. In addition, the newly discovered Oriental model beauty Ye Qiuxin co-starred, which added a lot of color to the film. The photography skills and lighting are better than the previous works of Tianyi. For the sake of thanking the audience who love to watch her works, the star Chen Yu-mei specially printed 3,000 exquisite New Year cards and distributed them to all circles in this city. All those who receive Chen Yu-mei's New Year card and bring the card to the Carlton to "watch the Flame of Youth" can exchange for a recent small photo of Ms. Chen Yu-mei, signed by her, to commemorate the audience of "Flame of Youth".</p>
<p>Here, let us turn to the Christmas postcards of the stars. Below is a description of the postcard patterns of several stars:</p>
<p>Jack Oakie's: A maid is kissing the ice store clerk, the ice melts, the cat jumps, and the bouquet jumps into the air.</p>
<p>Norma Shearer's: In a silver world, two red little deer are dancing, doesn't this completely express her mood?</p>
<p>Jackie Cooper's: Santa Claus is riding a small boat, crossing waves as high as mountains, heading towards "The World of Children".</p>
<p>Janet Gaynor's: A girl making a snowman, a bright moon hanging over the woods, with the words "This is a very cold snowman, but I wish you a happy Christmas with great enthusiasm"!</p>

<p>— Bi Bi</p>
<p>Set designer Fang Peilin is probably from Ningbo, so many people call him Brother Afang.</p>
<p>It is said that Brother Afang is twenty-seven years old this year, but he is still unmarried. At a banquet, Afang's fellow villager Ying Yunwei proposed that everyone should call Fang Peilin "Xiao Wan" (Ningbo dialect for "child").</p>
<p>Many people asked him why? He replied:</p>
<p>"The rules in Ningbo are that anyone who has not married a wife, whether he is sixty or seventy years old, is called 'Xiao Wan'." At that time, everyone at the banquet laughed.</p>
<p>However, Brother Afang is going to marry a wife next spring. Then, the time to be "Xiao Wan" is at most only a few dozen days.</p>

<p>Tan Ying said: "Female stars should know a few words, otherwise, it is very inconvenient to go anywhere." Therefore, there are several female stars now, such as Wang Renmei, Li Lili, and Tan Ying, who are still in school.</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun, the star of "The Angry Tide of the Chinese Sea", is very intelligent. Although she did not spend much time in school, her knowledge is already considerable. Usually, when she has free time, her father often teaches her to read, so her literature has improved day by day. Recently, Yuan Meiyun gets up every morning and practices a page of large calligraphy without interruption. I have seen her large characters, and they have indeed made great progress.</p>
<p>This is truly a rare female star, I think. (Que Chou)</p>

<p>Since the Lianhua Second Factory started filming "Sports Queen", it has received a lot of help from the education and sports circles, so it has been holding grand feasts in the Golden Palace for days, with the Sports Queen personally bestowing imperial wine to express her condolences. A few days ago, it also hosted a banquet for the Shanghai Provincial Middle School and the Liangjiang Women's Physical Education Normal School. The two schools strongly supported Lianhua's production of this film, which promotes the popularity of sports and promotes the true spirit of sports. When filming the location of the sports meeting, Shanghai Middle School selected 100 male and female scouts, 20 military band members, 20 medical team members, and two scout tents to maintain order and participate in the performance. Liangjiang also selected 40 female athletes to support the event. Lianhua Company expressed its heartfelt gratitude for the brave and generous support of the two schools and other news, education, and sports circles, because in European and American countries, film companies can often get the full support of all circles, which is rare in China.</p>

<h3 id="e272">Shanghai 24 Hours (6) <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Fu</p>
<p>Wow! Good fellow! He stole something and actually used the money to do good deeds generously. This is a "criminal" act! It is a pity that this act was not seen by the comprador or the comprador's wife, otherwise, would he still be able to "get away with it" like this?</p>
<p>But naturally, the comprador and his wife will not see Lao Zhao. They will never be together. At this time, the wife is sleeping sweetly in the mansion. And the comprador is busy working in the yarn factory at this time. - Half an hour ago, the comprador was summoned to the office of the yarn factory's manager. The manager has a small goatee under his nose and is short. He is a person with an "exotic flavor". His attitude is solemn and awe-inspiring, seemingly more impressive than the comprador. And the comprador seems very humble and respectful in front of him.</p>
<p>The manager said: "The northern area has recently returned to the state before the war, but the business in Shanghai and the Yangtze River basin is not good: this is your responsibility!"</p>
<p>The comprador did not get angry when he heard this lesson. "Yes, yes," he kept saying "yes" in his mouth, thinking about a clever plan to expand the business for the manager. - Now this clever plan has been approved by the manager and he has returned to the factory to implement it.</p>
<p>At this time, the comprador is busy: directing the factory staff to tear off the original labels on all the yarn bales and replace them with new labels - the labels are prominently printed with the words: "Completely Domestic Goods". Due to the comprador's loyalty, these many foreign yarn bales marked "Completely Domestic Goods" will soon flow into the domestic goods market in an endless stream, and then be delivered to the hands of the buyers (who are of course Chinese). But who knows the secret of the "clever plan" in this?</p>
<p>(9) The Punished Soul</p>
<p>Time crawls forward second by second. The life of the injured child laborer is becoming shorter. His body lies stiffly, motionless; but his chest rises and falls violently: his throat is like bellows, breathing difficultly and urgently. His eyes are half open and half closed, and the eyeballs have gone somewhere, leaving only a line of gray sclera.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law of the sick child whose business was suspended by the comprador's mansion sits beside him, watching this scene, and her heart feels like something is stabbing hard needle by needle. Lao Zhao's doctor has been invited, but the doctor only looked at the lying child, said nothing, shook his head disappointedly and left. The child's expression looks more and more wrong, as if smiling but not smiling, with his eyes half open like that. Chen Da's woman is getting anxious and just shouts for help, calling "Brother, brother!"</p>
<p>She shouts, but it is useless even if she shouts herself hoarse: the brother rolls his eyes and dies.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law cries and cannot lift her head. Standing next to her without saying a word, shedding tears, is Lao Zhao, who just invited the doctor. (To be continued)</p>
