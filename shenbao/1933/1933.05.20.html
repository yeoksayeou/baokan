<p>— 青</p>
<p>邇日以來。日人方面。正在力圖擾亂華北。陰謀建樹第二僞組織。興挾溥儂入關。或列强共管等種種方策之際。忽又盛傳中日妥協之謠。而同時華北政委長黄郛氏。則絕對否認妥協之說。謂「華北局勢。危急如斯。如何妥協。誰人敢談妥協。」語氣堅定。則妥協之說。吾人自當信其爲謠傳。</p>
<p>然而就邇日之事實觀察。吾人則又如入五里霧中。十七日以前。當我軍「爲戰略關係而撤退佈置新陣地」之際。敵軍如狂風驟雨。各路猛進。平津時形勢極險。風聲鶴唳。草木皆兵。人心惶惶。不可終朝。舉國爲之震動。然而自黄郛氏到平而後。前線即立時入於休戰狀態。敵軍旣停止前進。平津人心。亦「大爲安定。」據電訊所傳。黄氏曾言此行亦以安定華北人心爲第一着。今果已做到。則至少似已獲得敵之「諒解。」否則黄氏方抵平。何以竟能使猛進之敵。忽爾按兵不前耶。然而妥協之說。又實出於謠傳。此我人之所以認爲謎也。</p>
<p>我國今日一切無組織。無力量。或有人認爲「在今日抵抗爲無意義之犧牲。」吾人認此不過爲片面之理由。但何以致此。即最近數年來内戰不止。政治腐化。大難臨頭而内部不能團結。强寇當前而漠然罔覺。競權奪利者如故。高歌酣舞者如故。吾人於此。固復何言。然而我國人尙謀所以力自振拔。而决不甘心自棄也。</p>
<p>抑尤有進者。最近當局嘗以國難之嚴重喻火坑。以自身跳入火坑爲言。此言似是而實非。蓋所謂跳火坑者。就個人之立塲而言可也。但今日之問題。乃在如何出我民族於火坑。若曰大家都跳入火坑。則惟有同歸於盡耳。跳火坑者又適爲拉人入火坑耳。我人民早已陷於水深火熱之中矣。今日之要求。爲出水火而登袵席。爲謀如何乃能大家跳出火坑。苟當局對於華北。眞有大家跳出火坑之道。則人心自然安定矣。當局之暫時跳入火坑。吾人方將以生佛視之。謠言又安足慮哉。</p>

<p>法德總理有在日内瓦會見說</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日軍縮會議總委員會開會時、主席漢德森發言請各代表互相讓步、務祈成立公約、漢氏稱頌羅斯福總統之宣言、謂此宣言對於軍縮會議之工作、大有貢獻、繼援引星期三日德總理希特勒之演說、以表示德總理現勸軍縮會議同情考慮美總統之宣言、主席發言後、德代表那杜尼聲稱、德國决定接受英首相麥唐納所提出之軍縮計畫、那杜尼以德政府之名義宣告接受英首相計畫、不獨認爲討論之根據、且認爲將來軍縮公約之基礎、渠以爲此種宣布可爲德國溫和精神及和衷辦事之充分證據、希望他國亦竭力在英相計畫範圍内以調節其利益、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）今日美國務院已訓令台維斯、在日内瓦軍縮會議、遵照總統計畫、正式提議不侵略公約、聞美總統致各國元首之籲請和平保障文、將在軍縮總委員會宣讀、而台維斯並將加以解釋、現羅斯福總統通電發出後、各國迅速響應、而德國要求所造成之僵局、亦有化除希望頗爲愉快、（十八日國民社電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）　法德兩國總理有於下星期内會於日内瓦之說、果爾、則軍縮會以定續有生氣矣、聞法總理達拉第之摯友現勸法總理努力與德總理晤商、以此爲澄清緊張空氣之最善方法、據非正式消息、此種會晤之計畫刻正在研究中、現悉美代表台維斯首先創議、兩總理晤談、以解脫法德間窘境、法官塲現未表示意思、但衆信法總理已接受此項建議、美代表台維斯自抵歐洲以來、即在國際幕後從事極重要工作、美總統羅斯福之在德總理希特勒國會致詞以前發出昭告世界之文、亦出於台維斯之請也、（十八日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　此間軍縮會方面對於五月十九日軍縮會總委員會集議時應採之程序、現感覺困難、德方聲稱、德總理希特勒已說明德國之立塲、故德代表那杜尼無須再有申說、現應由法代表披露法國之主張云、但法方未必即準備發言、且在五月十九日以前、法閣員未能即抵日内瓦、是以衆料英代表艾登將屆時致詞、而主席漢德森亦或將發揮意見、（十八日路透社電）</p>

<p>（日内瓦）　軍縮會議總委員會將於午後三點半開會、主席漢特森首將陳述最近事變、繼乃稱贊羅斯福總統之宣言、並提及希特勒之演說、然後要求軍縮會議恢復工作、並從速結束、美國代表台維斯將代表羅斯福總統答謝、德國代表那多尼已於上午十點乘飛機抵此、似欲用「日内瓦式之語調」重述希特勒演說中某部分主張、那多尼並將邀請各國代表團分别說明其意見、英國代表艾登會於今晨與漢特森晤談、渠或將發表演說、據一般推想、德國將用一種手段、由意國加以擁護、俾强令英法兩國對於「德國所作讓步」報以相當之犧牲云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>張垣特訊、自九一八事變救國軍風起雲湧於吉東各地、馮占海將軍、以一團的力量、號召愛國志士、連絡宮·姚等救國軍、轉戰於黑水白山的大平原上、等到去年秋天的時候、因爲子彈後援不繼、無可奈何中、由敵人的飛機重砲火力交相壓迫下、犧牲若干志士、始到達熱河省境、後方對於彈藥給養、還没有補充好、而敵逆又開始攻熱、馮將軍扼守開魯和赤峯之綫、抗戰一週、而喪心病狂的崔劉附逆影響全盤戰局的進退、不得已始間道退多倫、天氣嚴寒、北風吹雪、弟兄們單衣鐵槍、爬山越嶺、集中於多倫、當時敵軍攻察的呼聲又起、馮軍稍事整頓、即準備抵抗、後因物質困難已極、馮軍奉令暫退後方整理、從此多倫防務、歸趙騎兵軍担任、沽源至多倫之郊外、仍歸防守、不久該軍即奉命改編爲□□□師、原有馬匹、皆繳歸北平、一變而成爲步兵、該軍之馬匹、皆爲東北鄕間農民所有、救國軍的弟兄、皆來自鄕間、自備槍馬、始終浴血抗日、每個人的馬、都是出生入死的共同努力着、一旦把馬離開、弟兄們多有落淚者、似乎和那家人離别的情景一樣、馮占海將軍自從改編步兵□□□軍後、駐防的地方、都是在鄕間、但是這些由鄕間來的抗日英雄們、對於當地民衆感情、非常融洽　例如沾源縣境内的平頂堡鎭、向來受敎堂的保護　無論若何軍隊、都不能通過、還用說在那個地方住呵、但是自從馮軍駐防該地後、土兵紀律嚴明、該鎭即請求馮將軍派駐該鎭若干軍隊、以資保護商民、馮將軍不得已、始在平頂堡鎭設一參謀處、爲的是和沽源軍事連絡上比較便當、所以馮占海將軍的部下、也很相安無事、多倫失陷後、趙承綬的騎兵五個團、就背進到張北縣集中、這樣一來、第一綫的軍隊、全是□□□軍、馮占海將軍進駐平頂堡、就近指揮、四五兩日敵逆軍劉桂堂等、約兩千餘名、向「大梁底」試攻、屢被馮軍擊退、每日除有砲兵試射外、並無南下的模樣、馮將軍於此時、認爲有反攻的機會、可以收復多倫、鞏固察東防務、於是籌劃妥貼、攻擊部隊爲一旅零兩團、旅長姓趙、其餘兩團一騎一步、騎兵團團長孫、步兵團長王、於八日夜此項攻擊部隊、即在馮將軍指揮之下、進入攻擊準備位置、附屬砲兵一營、山·野·迫·等外、又有重機關槍十五挺、輕機槍和自働步槍、爲數甚夥、士兵每人附手炸彈六枚、當夜準備完善、於九日拂曉開始前進攻擊、於是「大梁底」一塲血戰、從茲開始矣、</p>

<p>中日雙方均認停戰有可能性</p>
<p>王正廷認中日問題係國際性</p>
<p>新聲社云、新任華北政務委員會委員長黄郛氏、抵北平後、本埠盛傳中日有進行妥協之說、雖黄氏屢曾聲明、絕不簽訂任何協定、本埠日領署、亦曾否認所傳之兩妥協條件、但外間揣測、仍衆論紛紜、熱河旣失、究竟日軍是否將進攻平津、誠爲全國上下所急欲知者、昨據新聲社記者探悉中日雙方爲此事曾一度在滬磋商、惟故將來能否實現、尙難預料、就前外交部長王正廷氏之談話觀之、亦謂有停戰之可能性、惟事實相距尙遠、至將來果有談判之可能時、日方表示將在軍人中派代表、有吉公使暫不北上、茲分誌各情於次、</p>
<h3 id="c115">晤有吉明 <a href="#c115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>昨據傳聞、北方中日軍事之妥協、曾經黄郛與日使有吉明、作數度之磋商、因有「雙方諒解華軍暫駐於灤河以南、則日軍退出長城之外、及不勗勵幷不供給義勇軍擾亂「滿洲國」兩種條件之傳說、但日使館發言人、於談話之際、雖否認黄氏與有吉商及此事、至前日所傳之妥協條件、聞亦係由日使館所傳出、</p>
<h3 id="c116">代表問題 <a href="#c116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>昨日謠傳日使有吉明將俟時機成熟時北上任代表、但該使館發言人、昨日曾否認此說、據謂、此事現尙未聞有何種進展、即令將來時機果然成熟時、日使亦不北上任代表、蓋以其解决之性質、係屬軍事上之地方性質也、且預料中政府必極端避免涉及東北問題、故此次正式外交代表、僅由軍事方面委一代表、如有必要時、或由使館方面、派員輔助、一如上海停戰時日使重光所居之地位也、至軍事代表之人選、再有問題、蓋以日本在華北之軍事而論、實應由華北日軍司令中村負責、但在戰事方面而言、作戰之軍隊、即係武藤司令軍隊、則又應由武藤負責</p>

<p>前任外交部長王正廷、昨日由京蒞滬後、對往訪之新聲社記者發表談話、表示華北軍事、始進行與淞滬類似之停戰、則實有此可能性、但事實上之距離尙遠、蓋中日問題、現下戰不可言戰、和亦無從言和、成爲一種國際性之國際問題矣、故其根本問題、必須我國内部之從速團結、以謀解决、無論如何、所失領土如果三省之浩大、絕不能放棄也、查中日自甲午一戰、迄今已三十餘年、吾人因健忘心甚大、不知勵志圖强、故有今日也、試觀日本侵略之政策如何、王氏繼言及美大總統羅斯福氏之宣言、謂其甚爲公道偉大、然吾人仍須自强、絕不能因羅氏一紙空言、即可說退日軍也、自强之道、應注重生産力、要有生産、非政府與人民合作不可、因政府之責任爲保護人民、而人民之責任、則爲擁護政府、故人民有生産、須賴政府之保護、否則人民無生産、政府亦無保護之力、則國家焉有不亡哉、王氏認爲東北問題、絕非三數年所可能解决、然亦須吾人有堅持之心、即不簽字於任何關於割讓東北土地證據之决心、一如巴黎黎議之所爲、蓋不簽字於任何憑據、則東北之收回仍有望、此點極關重要、而尤須全國人民、有此精神、王氏言時、幷舉山東青島問題與法國之阿爾塞斯勞賴兩事爲例、山東青島問題、自歐戰時起、爲民國十一年、經過八年之久始决、阿爾塞斯與勞賴兩省、經德國佔據三五十年之久、終爲法人收回、故東北問題、只要不簽割讓之憑據、則終可收回、最後王氏談至妥協問題、認爲不可能、蓋雙方即無ＣommonＢases（低度之解决基礎）實無從言妥協、試問日本可依允撤兵至南滿鐵路線否、國人勿以有和緩之氣象、則即可高枕無憂、須知日人可隨時仍來侵犯也、</p>

<p>五月十三日在青年會講</p>
<p>一二八以後，兄弟還没有到任何地方，去演講過，今天來這裏演講，還是一二八以後的第一次。爲什麽這樣長的時候，没有演講過一次呢？兄弟覺得中國人身體上發展的退步委實太厲害了，除掉一張嘴巴之外，其餘皆是無用的。嘴巴能夠講，能够唱高調，然而手不會做。所以兄弟在一二八之後除下决心做點事情外，没有參加過任何演講。</p>
<p>今天我到青年會來講，實有推辭不得的苦衷。</p>
<p>一二八離開我們，在時間上不甚遠，在空間上尤其近；所以如果對諸君講點事實，這是人人都知道的，對諸君講點理論，這又要近乎唱高調了。這裏不過講講我的感想。</p>
<p>大家知道得很清楚，在一二八以前上海人都是高談抵抗的，可是到了一二八之前的一禮拜，因爲禍患在眼前，許多人便又希圖苟安了，一二八的晚上，市政府終於對日本屈服了；日本領事表示滿意。許多人心裏簡直以爲可以苟安了，這眞是最可痛心和可恥的事。我以爲旁人用武力來侵略我們不是恥辱，我們自己的不爭氣纔是頂大的恥辱。</p>
<p>一二八事變爆發之後，大家都以爲十九路軍不能抵抗，但是十九路軍畢竟能抵抗到一個月多！又大家都知道一二八的事變爆發後商務印書館的犧牲是很大的。我認爲商務書館爲能抵抗外侮的十九路軍而犧牲，雖然損失極大，畢竟還算値得。十九路軍這種積極抵抗的行爲在國民敎育上有很大的意義，商務印書館因此而犧牲，比之出十萬部書以貢獻敎育文化其效力尤大。</p>
<p>我常常想，中國的兵是最不怕死的。因爲一船中國人的生活很苦，許多人的房屋比諸墓墳没有高得很多，這種人對於死和活本没有多大分别，所以打起仗來，中國兵本來最不怕死。可是因爲中國的將官太舒服，太有錢，他們便捨不得死。偶然遇着幾個不要錢不怕死的將官，他的部下便成爲無敵的勁旅了。</p>
<p>青年會這星期舉行的演講，目的在使人知道國恥。其實我們的國恥這樣多，那裏會不知道，我以爲與其使人知恥，倒不如使人知錯更爲有用。</p>
<p>我認爲我們的第一大錯，在於所說的話和所做的事相離太遠。一二八事變發生後全市商店都罷市、等停戰協定簽字後纔開市；他們都在店門口貼一張紙，呌做「忍痛開市」。對的！我們是忍耐着悲痛開市的！但是結果怎樣呢！有些人把「忍痛開市」改做「忍痛開心」倒是很切實的，大多數的市民恐怕完全忘掉了先前所受的痛苦了！試看一二八以後社會上的一切不正當享樂，比諸一二八之前减了多少呢？</p>
<p>歐戰時候參戰各國的國民生活都很刻苦，爲着長期作戰的緣故，不獨把一切不必要的消耗都極力免除了，甚至兩日的食物，也分作三日捐用。那時候我國留歐的學生，恐怕還記得每日所吃幾片黑麵包的滋味罷。我國現在全國已陷於戰爭的狀態，而自衛的能力又遠不及那時歐洲的各交戰國。然而我國人，尤其是上海的市民，至今仍没有絲毫减少太平時代的享用。眞可謂莫名其妙了，我國危險到這地步，我們做國民的縱不能積極上做救國的工作，至少消極上也須爲國家保全一點的元氣才好，無意識的消耗物力，便是摧殘國家的元氣，此外還有國民的體力也是國家的元氣所關，歐戰後德國被協約國限制軍備，但是他們國内的男女老幼都特别注重體格的鍛鍊，預備國家一旦和外國戰爭時，人人都可以當兵，可是我們怎樣呢？我們在經濟方面作種種無意識的消耗，而且在體力上精神上也祗管糟塌，說起來眞是痛心和恐懼啊。</p>
<p>我們第二件要知道的錯，就是没有方針。九一八以後，人民只知道唱高調，政府只知道爭面子，前幾日的大晚報有一篇社論，說中國現在不獨没有岳飛，甚至連秦檜也没有。敵人舉國一致，按着固定的方針來對待我。我國却依違於和戰之間，不獨没有全國一致的方針，甚至一個小團體，也是意見紛歧，而且前後衝突。</p>
<p>我們的錯處很多，這二點可算最大。我們倘若回想起來，九一八以來我們的錯處是數不盡的。</p>
<p>我們應該追認我們的錯，把他痛改，政府國民都不要祇管面子，應該確定方針，一致對外，然後能打破嚴重的國難。反之，黑暗正多着。說話也是空的。（葉文雄記）</p>

<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>播音機或是發報機上用的調節度盤，祗要有細微的移動，便不能得到穩定的振蕩。所以對於度盤上的指示點不能不求其十分準確。</p>
<p>本篇所說的指示圖，是利用微分尺（ＶernierＳcale）的原理而做成的。在度盤的後面，糊上一張相當大小的黑紙，用白粉在黑紙上劃成十格，每格的大小，比原來度盤上的格子要小十分之一，總計十格的距離，祗等於原來度盤上九格地</p>
<p>位。（如圖Ｃ）使用時注意卜下兩線合併時的小數字，便是所需要的小數點。如圖Ａ，爲十八度又十分之七，圖Ｂ，爲三十八度又十分之八。</p>
<h3 id="c179">半交流式之單管收音機 <a href="#c179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— 愷</p>
<p>交流式收音機現在確已代替了直流式收音機之位置，但以聲音之清晰而論，交流機終不及直流機，尤于單管中有顯著之區别。不過管理簡易；費用低廉；則爲交流機之所長，若連合二者之長處，在直流方面以極少之更動，作成半交流式之收音機，其他部份仍以電池担任，可兼得上述之優點。</p>
<p>直流機之用電，以甲電池爲費，乙電較省，故甲電池首先屛棄不用，今用傍熱式眞空管，以電鈴變壓器，燃燈絲，則可省費不秒。乙電仍用電池，以保持其音質之清楚。電鈴變壓器大都輸出那十瓦特左右，其次級圈有三弗打至八弗打或四弗打至十二弗打不等，電流均一安培，爲謀適合所用眞空管需要起見，可將次級圈拆下，依下述方法改繞之。</p>
<p>設所用眞空管爲２２７，其絲極電壓爲二弗打半，電流爲一·七五安培，而變壓器原來所繞之次級圈如爲二百八十五圈，其最大輸出電壓爲八弗打時，則應改繞爲八十九圈，如下式：丨</p>
<p>圈數旣得，而變壓器原爲一安培，故宜兩線並行繞入，即可得二安培，綫路可仍用普通再生力式如圖。</p>
<h3 id="c180">簡易的避電裝置 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— 徐潤身</p>
<p>夏季已到，天氣潮熱，不免時有雷雨，凡裝有高大天線的，若受落雷影響，必至損壞收音機件，所以應該注意避雷器的，裝置下列幾種，費用極省不妨一試　　（一）此圖只須用單閘刀一只，照圖連接，雷雨時，向下關好，則天電直接入地。</p>
<p>（二）用雙閘刀開關，照圖連接，雷雨曉向下關好，天線完全通地，且與收音機隔絕，最爲安全。</p>
<p>（三）用裝電燈的開關，及樸落各一只，照上裝置，收音時，只須將揷頭揷入樸落，雷雨時，將揷頭拔去，上面開關關好</p>
<p>（四）可利用燒去燈絲的眞空管、或用舊的燈泡，將天地綫銲住於眞空管ＧＰ二只脚上，然後通入收音機即成避雷器蓋天電電壓極大，能飛越眞空，直通地線也</p>
<h3 id="c181">高壓眞空管 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>目下無線電之眞空管，絲極電壓大抵爲一弗打至六弗打，其絲極電源之供給皆賴變壓器。惟製造變壓機爲困難問題之一，因太大則多占位置，太小則極易發熱燒燬。使購置無線電機者常多出一筆意外之修理費。</p>
<p>幾年以前，歐洲即有人思製造無需變壓器之高壓眞空管，今巳成功，其檢波，放大，振盪，整流，一切效用完全無異於現用之眞空管，惟其絲極之電壓爲一百十或二百弗打，可直接接用家用電源，於收音機之製造簡省少少。</p>
<p>三極管</p>
<h3 id="c182">雙屛整流管 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>其絲極略如電燈中之燈絲，但不至白熾，故熱度比較甚低，電路中雖有電壓變化不生或覺，發音不受影響</p>
<p>而無噓聲，其壽命亦大增，因用於一百十弗打者其絲熱度只在九百度上下，而平常四弗打者則在一千二百度左右，故易損毁也。</p>
<p>絲極在一種稀土製成之筒中，筒外塗金屬養化物一層，槅極爲繞成螺旋狀之金屬絲，屛極非片而爲極細之金屬網</p>
<p>整流管有二對或四對整流器，及製成韋士登橋線路者可使出電成極平整之直流，用於供給眞空管之須較高屛極電壓者，可用特製之「抗壓管」，用一百十弗打時出電在三百十弗打以上，此種眞空管之又一利益，即亦可使用直流電，故製成之收音機，不論所在之處之電源爲直流交流皆可用，堪稱無線電界最近之一大發明也。</p>

<p>— 陸並謙記</p>
<p>四、中國的敎育問題　（一）「敎師訓練」德國對敎師資格很嚴必須大學畢業、才可担任、以前畢業於師範者、都入大學補習、程度提高、做敎師便非易事、凡是大學畢業生、先做助敎三四年、甚而十五年後、才可擔任、中國不然、大學生决不願做小學敎師、更不願做小學助敎、階級觀念很深、外國只須自己的興趣所在、敎育便是他終身的事業、我以前主張中小學敎師應該有相同的訓練、不應在訓練上有所區别、當時還以爲是一種夢想、現在、德國已在那裏實行了、才知道這並非是一種理想、其次是敎師經騐、也很重要、英國對於敎師學識、不很注重、却注重於實習、普通的一個師範生、没有達到畢業的時期、已有實地的經騐、在俄國、近年學校數發達很快、不識字者、以前有百分之八十五左右、現在祗有百分之十一或十二、全國人民差不多都能識字、除了西伯利亞等一部分的地方、因爲學校發達、師資便感缺乏、他們却先辦學校、敎師不够時、便以識字而能敎者充任、等他任敎的時候、再加以訓練、如組織研究會等、使各人服務期間都有進修的機會、中國現在的情形、正需要救急的辦法、那末、俄國便是一個很好的榜樣、方才潘局長說、上海全市入學兒童不過百分之三十、未入學者倒在百分之六十、南京市亦然、學校這樣的少、兒童入學的機會自然不多、這種現象十分危險、要求中國敎育的進步、當然很難、我認爲我們現在儘可多設學校、等到學校數有相當的發達、再去求進步、那也未晚、（二）「兒童養護」歐洲各國對兒童養護、很能注意、大槪因爲大戰以後、人口死亡太多、生殖率減少、同時兒童身體也退化、於是他們不得不注意於此點、奥國維也納對兒童養護更週到、在一個小孩没有生産以前、已很注意、他們把全市分爲幾區、每區設看護若干人、分别從事各家庭的調查、或者設法改造他的環境、將及生産便代他通知工廠准予請假、</p>

<h3 id="c215">知打書的實現 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>說書先生說到什麽「打擩臺」，「盜盟書」，「大破銅網陣」，這一類武俠小說，其名呌做短打書。短打的意義，是和明盔亮甲、寛袍六袖的三國志精忠傳等不同；每逢演講，最合配於一輩穿短打的農工社會，所以短打書的塲子，越是離開城市，做的生意趨好，說到一拳來，一脚去，飛簷走壁用功夫，梅花古椿顯本領；管敎一輩穿着短打的聽客，聽的眉毛根根活動，面皮忽而緊張忽而鬆懈做出種種滑稽的表示。</p>
<p>山東主席韓復榘，旣然行了招賢文書，聘請四方會得飛簷走壁擒拿點穴的奇才異能。吾想「重賞之下，必有勇夫」，山東道上，或者已有了許多奇奇怪怪的人物，來做韓青天的黄天覇。但，没有擺過擂臺，没有把他們的驚人本領在大衆面前表現，那麽短打書中的人物，究竟有没有實現的可能性？這還是一個問題。</p>
<p>山東雖没有設立擂臺，但，在香港，將有梅花椿擂臺出現了。前兩廣國術館長蔡懿恭，是赫赫有名王隱林的門徒，旣會舞刀使劍，又會手去身離，非脈不點諸術。港地紳商羨慕他的武藝超羣，在此國難臨頭的時侯，要請他到香港來提倡國術。而且，擬在新界沙田籌設一古式梅花椿擂臺，歡迎各界人士參加；梅花椿純用大杉造成，臺高一丈二尺，先用大杉五百四七條植立地上，每條距離一尺，配成梅花式樣，以五條爲一朶，全臺一百零八朶，臺下陳列刀槍劍戟諸武器，不設木梯，純用　上落下的工夫，非有上乘國術，便無法可以豋這梅花椿古式擂臺。我見了這段記載，一切「金臺傳」，「七俠五義」種種短打書，益發有實現的具體化了。</p>
<p>提倡國術，不可加以非難，但，在敵人飛機大砲任所欲爲的時候，僅僅提倡國術，只怕緩不濟念吧！一方面提倡舊時代的拳術，一方面還得發明新時代的利器，倘使，大刀隊臨陣萬能，敵人會得猖獗到這般地步麽？吾以爲新時代利器，比着舊時代拳術尤其需要而適用。</p>
<h3 id="c216">「阿三」「阿四」合傳 <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>自從阿大阿二合夥出外唱蓮花落一去不返之後，祇剩下一個阿三和一個阿四。講到阿三的資格，眞可算得一個老上海了。六十多年以前，上海還是一片荒土，阿三就跟着西洋人來上海做闢草萊的工作。那時上海當然不像現今這樣繁華和便利，西洋人工作疲勞之餘，要找張椅子坐着休息都不得，老是直着嗓子喊聲“ＩＳay”、阿三就莫名其妙地跑到他們面前，他們拍着他的背，意思是呌他面向着地蹲下去，於是一張「人造椅」是成功了。據說，西洋人吸烟讀報的時間，大半是在這張人造椅上消磨過去的。</p>
<p>阿三旣立下這種功勞，又因爲他無家可歸，西洋人就特别看待他。那時阿四眞不識相，竟敢和西洋人爲難，大放其殺洋人一類的野話。於是西洋人就利用阿三去收捨阿四，直到如今，阿三還是掛着武裝帶站在十字路口，高興起來就打幾下阿四的耳光解解悶，威風着實來得！</p>
<p>苦惱的阿四，據說還是敗落戶大族一個没出息的子孫。他祖上是世襲的地皮掮客，專和洋人做買賣。在他們手中「出送」的地皮，合算起來，不下幾千萬方里。可是洋人對於這個鞠躬盡瘁的「殺老虎」，並不十分得寵。反說他生成賤骨，没有國家觀念，絕不像阿三來得寵倖，所以家况逐漸式微。直至阿四一代，丨丨或許是末代丨丨洋人奸巧到能用武力去搶地皮，用不着掮客兜攬，阿四世襲的職銜，就此宣告作廢。阿四經此打擊之後，鬱鬱不得志，越發貪吃懶做，萎蘼不振。洋人本說他是病夫，侵陵亦愈甚，他也就愈怕，瞧着洋人的影子就跑。可憐他原本害了二十三年乾血癆，現在貧病交迫，内外夾攻，憔悴得簡直不成人樣。可是他的生性倒非常高傲，他見諸葛道號「臥龍」，他就自比「睡獅」。當然，獅子在沉睡的時候，什麽動物都可欺侮他，但一經醒來，誰也不是他的敵手。阿四抱負之大，於此可見。不過，這隻睡獅究竟何時纔能醒來，阿四自己恐亦没有把握，所以阿四現在仍是一個阿四，一直到他消滅的時候！</p>

<p>王瑚（鐵珊）不愧爲一代的廉吏，他老人家的死，海内人上，一致的痛惜他，鄙人從朋好席上，聽得他老人家的軼事，揀饒有風趣的，記兩椿出來，也許爲茶餘酒後的絕好談助呢。</p>
<p>瑚持躬以儉，雖榮任江蘇省長，依舊守着寒素書生的本色，布衣一襲，樸質無華，常屛從外出，徒步而行，及雙足蹇疲，始雇人力車以代步，有時人力車夫索値過昻，他往往因吝惜數個銅圓故，卒蹣跚而歸，即對於家庭方面的開支，也是抱着節流主義，省至無可再省，他的夫人，依舊井臼親操，養鴨飼鷄，不辭勞瘁，有一天他忽返家，見夫人把白米給雞雛吃，便很不快樂地，責備他的夫人說：雞吃白米，何用此糠粞爲？夫人不服氣，頓時勃谿了一塲，他挾着餘忿，到外邊去糴糠粞，不料祗有白米，篇糴糖粞不得，纔知已的刻舟膠柱，錯怪了夫人，連忙向夫人道歉，夫人也一笑解慍。</p>
<p>他進膳不多備餚，說：旣然是吃飯，當以飯爲主，以餚爲賓，富厚之家，每吃一頓飯，輒肴核雜呈，珍饈滿案，這未免有失吃飯的本意了，他於餚饌中最喜歡的是清燉鯽魚，鯽魚上面舖着火腿，冬菰，葱薑，猪油，視爲無上美味，每逢令節，必啖此藉以自慰，有勸他嗜鯽何不常煑的，他回答道：天下的美味，當留有餘以咀嚼之，若大嚼而盡，是傖楚所爲，且因口腹之故，日殺一生，也非儒家所許呢，有某下屬知道他老人家有嗜鯽癖特地購了多尾的巨大鯽魚來獻媚他。蓄在磁盎裏，兀是活躍不止，不料他老人家瞧了，非但不表歡迎，反而拒絕不受，某下屬固請，他說：承你盛意，却之不恭，那麽我當把你所饋的魚，懸掛幾尾在廳事上，俾賓客們都知道這魚是你所饋的就是了，某下屬大慚，急携魚遁去。</p>

<p>第七回　數語絕恩情閉門痛哭　一肩擔道義酌酒商談</p>
<p>可是他說，他决計不和你說，說也無益，因爲你是不肯聽他的話的，何必白糟踏那一口氣呢？因爲如此，我就對他說，這些話讓我來轉告你好了，免得兄弟兩個人爲了，這些話，倒喪失了和氣。積了聽了這些話，簡直無話可說，低了頭只管不作聲。後來還是基太太道：你也不必爲難，這話一說一了，只要你肯和老姑娘斷絕了來往，你哥哥也就不咎旣往。再說在一個月以前，他已經是讓我們推辭的不再上門了。若不是你昨天去約會伊到乳茶舖去，你們已經是不會有來往的了。老實說，這不都是你自己惹出來的订煩嗎？我不會說話，就只有這幾句，愛聽在你，不愛聽也在你，這盡於此，你自己斟酌罷。說畢，他抛掉了手上那一小截烟捲頭了，又拿了一根烟捲燃着火重吸上了。她昻了頭，靠着椅子背，微微帶了一些笑容。積之坐在堂屋子裏，有許久許久的時候，突然想得了一件什麽事情似的，站了起來，向甘太太作了一個揖道：嫂嫂，諸事都請你維持罷，我現在覺悟了，我照着你的話辦注是了。甘太太口裏噴出一口烟來，向他微笑着。積之看事不妙，又再三的央告着。甘太太對他注視了許久，見他已有軟化的樣子，這才笑道：你果然是覺悟了，我自然會帮你的忙，你放心好了，我决不讓你爲難的。積之見嫂子說這話時，態度是很誠懇的，料着不會戲弄自己，而且哥哥的事，嫂嫂能作八成主，嫂子說了這話，那比哥哥說的還要靈些，這也就大可以放心了。不過爲了這樣一個重大的警告，他軟化到了二十四分，只得由衙門裏回來，就向書房裏一縮。整整有一個星期之久，也不敢走出門來一步。老姑娘心裏，這就有些着急，什麽事把他得罪了，在那天會面之後，突然和我不見面呢？難道說，那天和我說的言語，全是一篇假話嗎？他如此想着，這個疑問，就更加深了。他照着以前的辦法，當四點多鐘的時候，就到大街上去迎候着積之，以便在路上談話。（七五）</p>

<h3 id="c243">中東路問題的輿論 <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 適夷</p>
<p>說是俄國要把中東路出賣了，輿論大爲沸騰，不單報紙上做評論的先生痛斥俄國人不夠朋友，而且有些「工會」「公團」也特地發宣言反對，彷彿東北淪亡，平津危急都可以滿不在乎，祇有中東路出賣才比炸彈丢到頭上還要緊。</p>
<p>中東路是日本猴子跟老熊吵架的最好的導火線、我們正巴望着它們眞的吵起架來，把猴子鬧急了，然後伸過手去，現成的「收回東北」，夠多麽省事。不料這隻熊再狡猾不過，它不願跟人吵，猴子要它的中東路，它就一刀兩斷賣掉，呌猴子要吵也無從吵起。這便急壞了我們等候他力干涉的中國人，大聲的喧嚷起來：</p>
<p>「你老熊不是反對帝國主義的麽，爲什麽又對帝國主義妥協起來！」</p>
<p>連自己曾經駡過「赤色帝國主義」的話也自己否認了。中國人就有這副本領。</p>
<p>但是反對出賣中東路的評論家自己也說：「現在我東北雖爲日本帝國主義所刦制，爲暴力所蹂躪，但終必有最後清算，物歸原主之一日。」這證據便是我們政府還在「一面抵抗，一面交涉。」而且還有「長期抵抗的整個計劃」。旣然整個的東北，現在不過是「寄之外府」而已，便由僞國出面收買了中東路，將來依然是我們的；則俄國的出賣不出賣，有什麽關係呢？如果眞出賣了，倒還可以省掉我們一筆「贖路儲金」，不是反而便宜？然則輿論之所以沸騰，豈不可怪！</p>
<h3 id="c244">天機 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 靜子</p>
<p>說話難，聽話更難，唯說話難，所以語言一天一天的艱澀，說來使你懂，又使你不懂，和讀推背圖燒餅歌一樣，過後才使父明白。唯聽話難，所以一般人便索興不聽，只睜大眼睛看。因爲推背圖和燒餅歌雖說艱澀得難懂，但過後總不會没有事實加以說明的。</p>
<p>不久以前，有人曾說：「因爲不能戰，所以要抵抗；因爲不能和，所以要交涉。」話是說得漂亮極了，八面玲瓏，面面顧到，使主戰者與主不戰者，主和者與主不和者都心滿意足。但究竟是戰呢？還是和呢？這却使人越想越不懂了。又如「長期抵抗」，「一面交涉，一面抵抗，」或「敵來我决抵抗」一類的話，都是在簡練的幾個字裏，含有無限的大文章，唯其有文章，所以艱澀，這便是語言的推背圖化。</p>
<p>最近又有人說：</p>
<p>「現局譬如一條巷中有房十餘所，頭兩所已被火，三四所亦將着，如不速隔斷，其餘將同燼。」</p>
<p>又說：</p>
<p>「人方以利刃逼我頸，不即殺我，惟逼我倒。及茲未倒，尙可挽救，倒則不堪救矣。」</p>
<p>這當然又是大有文章在的推背圖。假如話是這樣說的：「頭兩所房子被火，趕快拿救火機來吸水灌救；」或是「人以利刃逼我頸，我亦還之以利刃，及茲未倒，拚個死活，」那便索然無味，而且無文章可做了。又假如聽的人這樣問：「爲什麽只拆牆而不用救火機灌救呢？」「爲什麽人以利刃迫我我便安坐以待死呢」？這自然也是不會聽話的笨伯。</p>
<p>推背圖的讀法是不從字面的本身去推敲，而應從字以外的事實去體解去應證。那末，拆牆以外的事實是什麽？第一是「奸人」「謠言」對日妥協；第二是「敵」「逆」等過度刺激字面一律屛用；第三是華北軍事暫告結束，全綫入休戰狀態；第四是×××到平後，人心大爲安定，衆信其必有相當辦法。夠了，只就這四點看，推背圖的天機，不也就可以令我們窺破了嗎？</p>
<p>不過窺破天機也究竟是不易的事，大多數的愚民還是只會蒙在鼓裏聽「天」擺佈，等到牆已拆，他們才會知道。知道了又怎樣？人究竟是不能拿起石頭打破天。自然，這又正是「天機」的妙用！</p>
<h3 id="c245">法公園外 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 陶濤</p>
<p>一　暮春的早晨，整個城市在勞動者的工作聲中醒過來了。法公園外的行人道上有兩個舊俄羅斯帝國的臣民，一個四十多歲的女人帶着一個七八歲的孩子丨丨靜靜的走着。她永遠是那麽沉着，好像没有一件事値得她關心的。</p>
<p>走在前面的孩子忽然回過頭來！</p>
<p>「媽！我們看一看公園再走好嗎？」</p>
<p>她没有答應他，似可似不可的，她的孩子却耐不住了，䟡着脚，攀住水門汀做的闌干，像一隻餓鷹獵逐食物那樣貪婪的看着公園裏面。</p>
<p>「媽！有鹿！有鹿！」</p>
<p>她也靠着闌干向裏面看了一看。</p>
<p>她像其餘的白俄婦人一樣，面孔老是扳着，没有一點笑意，頭上紮着一塊花布，寛大的外衣裏面包着兩隻匏瓜一樣的奶子。她從前是一個貴婦人，說起來眞没有幾個人會相信的。她的孩子戴着一頂舊的鴨嘴帽，穿着一套把父親的舊衣改作成的衣裳，很可憐似的。但如果没有那可咀咒的革命的話，他該是一個貴胄，一個世襲，該受人尊敬的，可是現在什麽都完了，什麽都給他們國内的暴徒搗毁了。……</p>
<p>朝朝内看：兩隻大鹿，一隻小鹿，被關在鐵絲網内，是那麽没精打采的走着。她想：</p>
<p>「啊！這也眞可憐呢！」</p>
<p>她再看過去，樹蔭下一對情侣喁喁地談着，走着，男的輕輕地抱着女的腰，臉對着臉，…</p>
<p>「啊！………」</p>
<p>小孩正注視着一個女孩子把洋囡囡放在地上，因此並没有關心到他的母親的嘆氣。</p>
<p>她忽然陷入沉思中了。</p>
<p>一九一八年在巴黎與達考夫結婚時，那時證婚的牧師也說這對年輕夫婦是幸福的。那時確實没有想到會流落到現在的地步的。那時他們相信在短時期内能够驅逐暴徒出境，仍舊平平安安回國去的，誰知現在漂流到上海來了，國内還是被暴徒們佔據着……</p>
<p>「唉！有什麽辦法呢？我們漂流到上海來了。」她獨自想着：「利基的爸爸爲了生活，捨棄了王公的尊戲，背着磨刀機替人家磨洋刀了。唉！這是一件多麽恥辱的事啊！」</p>
<p>「唉！春光在他們身上！」她不禁嘆出聲來了。</p>
<p>「利基！回去呀！」</p>
<p>「嗯！………」</p>
<p>他顯然看上那洋囡囡，看上那小女孩子的洋囡囡了。</p>
<p>她又望着那小女孩子：</p>
<p>小女孩子穿着連裙的大反領衣裳，髮上結了一個蝴蝶飛，她把沙泥一瓢一瓢的掏進洋鐵箱裏去，她旁邊放着一個洋囡囡，那正是利基想要的。</p>
<p>「般生！來！」</p>
<p>「啊！魯以司。」</p>
<p>「你把洋槍帶來！」</p>
<p>「帶來了」</p>
<p>「……」</p>
<p>「………」</p>
<p>她回過頭來看一看利基，她又嘆氣起來：</p>
<p>「春天在他們身上！」</p>
<p>她拉了利基向前走，但利基還朝國中看着；她忽然又想起她的男人替人家磨洋刀的事情，她又嘆氣了：</p>
<p>「春光在有錢的人身上！」</p>
<p>「媽！………」利基不懂得她的意思，張大了眼睛望着她。</p>
<p>「啊！孩子，」她說，「你大起來的時候，得回到祖國去。就和那些暴徒一塊生活也是好的！」</p>

<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（三十）　孔乙巳考</p>
<p>予初讀魯迅先生之「孔乙巳」，髣髴描摹吾鄕之一「書憨子」。湘中俗話，所謂書憨子，恒指不成器之蹩脚文人。此猶爲敬語：稍帶嘲詈，則直以「桐油罐」「破夜壺」稱之矣。予始就學，亦嘗學「上大人孔乙巳」之描紅書，塾師蓋書憨子之流，固較孔乙巳高一等。及讀孔乙巳，以此諢名稱八股文人一流之廢物，視書憨子，桐油罐，破夜壺諸稱，則遠鄙倍，益雋妙矣。頃從友人芝岡先生讀書手册，借鈔明人葉盛水東日記一條云：「上大人，丘乙巳。化三千，七十士。爾小生，八九子。佳作仁，可知禮。尙仕由山水，中人坐竹林。王生自有性，平子本留心。王子去求仙，丹成入九天。山中方七日，世上巳千年。以上數語，凡鄕學小童，臨倣字書，皆昉於此，謂之描朱。爾傳我習，幾徧海内，然皆莫知所謂。或云僅取字畫簡少，無他義；或云義有了了可解者，且有所出也。」此所稱丘乙巳，即孔乙巳，也子名丘，不待詮釋也。明人初學，即習此描紅書，而不知其語從何出。敦煌掇瑣中輯，敎育類有一條云：「上大人，丘乙巳。化三千，七十二。女小生，八九子。牛羊萬，曰舍屯。（編者眉注云，以下字蹟模糊不可讀。）」可知此一描紅語訣，由來甚古，蓋遠在唐宋以前即有之歟？而孔乙巳爲不朽矣。</p>

<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨請你忍耐一下子，媽媽就完了。</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨倒是文縐縐的，但字太壞了，我簡直念不出來。</p>
<p>「好啦，爹爹，」紅蘿蔔鬚連忙說，「現在歸你了。」</p>
<p>當紅蘿蔔鬚挺直的站着，等候他的回答時，雷辟克把那封信一遍兩遍地念着，許久許久地審視着，照着他的習慣，發出幾聲「啊！啊！」隨後便把信放在桌上。</p>
<p>這封信現在毫無用處了，它的使命已經完了。它現在是屬於大家的了。誰都可以看它，拿它了。姐姐愛勒絲丁和大哥菲利克斯依次把它拿起來看，在那上面尋出一些拚綴上的錯誤。這兒紅蘿蔔鬚應該換一個筆頭，别人才可以看得清楚些。隨後，他們把信還給他。</p>
<p>他把信翻來翻去，蠢笑着，好像在問：</p>
<p>「誰要這封信嗎？」</p>
<p>末了，他重又把它塞在自己的帽子裏。</p>
<p>這時雷辟克家的給孩子們分配新年禮物。姐姐愛勒絲丁得着一個很大的洋囝囝，大哥菲利克斯得着一盒預備相打的鉛做的兵士。</p>
<p>「我給你買了一樣意想不到的東西。」雷辟克家的對紅蘿蔔鬚說。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨啊，是啦！</p>
<p>雷辟克家的丨爲什麽說：啊，是啦！你旣然曉得了，那我便用不着給你了。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚丨如果我曉得了，那我便永遠見不到上帝。</p>
<p>他把手高高舉起，一板正經地說。雷辟克家的把碗櫃打開。紅蘿蔔鬚喘促着。她把手伸到碗櫃頂裏面，一直伸到齊肩膀，慢慢地，顯着神秘的樣子，拿出一個用黄紙包好的紅糖做的烟嘴。</p>
<p>紅蘿蔔鬚毫不躊躇地臉上閃耀着喜悅。他知道現在應當怎樣辦的。很快地，他要當着他的雙親，在大哥菲利克斯和姐姐愛勒絲丁的羨慕的眼光底下（可是誰都不能有着一切啊！）抽着烟。他僅僅用兩個指頭撚着那紅糖做的烟嘴，彎着腰，把頭偏向左邊一點。他把嘴唇合成圓形，收緊兩頰，用力吸着，並做着響聲。</p>
<p>隨後，他仰起頭裝着吐出一大口烟的樣子：</p>
<p>「這烟嘴很好，」他說，「它非常通暢。」</p>
<p>來回</p>
<p>兩個小雷辟克和雷辟克姑娘放了假回來。當跳下公共馬車的時候，當他老遠看見他的變親的時候，紅蘿蔔鬚心裏想：</p>
<p>「這時就應當向他們跑去嗎？」</p>
<p>他躊躇着：</p>
<p>「還太早一點，我會跑得喘氣不來，並且凡事不應當表現得太過分了。」</p>
<p>他還遲疑着：</p>
<p>「我從這裏開始向他們跑去…………………，不，從那裏開始……………………」</p>
<p>他自己提出一些問題：</p>
<p>「我應當在什麽時候脫帽呢？兩個人裏面我應當先抱吻那一個呢？」</p>
<p>可是大哥菲利克斯和姐姐愛勒絲丁已經搶在他前面瓜分了那親熱的愛撫。當紅蘿蔔鬚趕到時，差不多一點都没剩下了。</p>
<p>「怎的，你這樣大了，還呌雷辟克先生做「爹爹」？」雷辟克家的說，「你應當對人說「我的父親」，和他握一握手，這才像個男子啦。」（未完）</p>

<p>— 牛</p>
<p>從前寫信的格式，末了往往有「心照不宣」，或「朗照不宣」等字樣，我當時看了，亦不甚措意，以爲是寫信的習慣語罷了，現在看看報紙，恍然大悟心照。不宣的妙用。</p>
<p>心照不宣，就是心心相印的意思，亦就是彼此諒解的意思，你的心事，我已知道，我的苦衷，你也明白，再進一步說，你的心事，非但知道，而且也可以答應我的苦衷，非但明白，而且也可以照辦，不過爲了面子上的關係，或恐。怕傍人說短論長起見，未便顯然有所表示罷了，若以狗男女來講，我們倆的愛。情，已到完全成熟時期，不過因爲家長的反對和傍人的訕笑的緣故，同居儘可。同居。不好意思正式交換飾物和舉行結婚儀式罷了，這就心照不宣的一個例子。</p>
<p>我嘗聽見老於竊玉偷香者說，妻不如妾，妾不如妓，妓不如偷，偷偷摸摸。的事情，最爲有趣，所以人家抛了髮妻，專和人家淫婦私姘，所謂私鹽越禁越。好賣，若照事實來講，這個女子，被人强奸，名譽已經破産，清白已經點汚，就是你去訴訟打官司，也是無用，索性嫁了這個奸漢罷了，但是事實上决不能。如此汚糟，她到底是一個清清白白的好女子呀。</p>
<p>這種。有辱門楣的事。倘然出於素無人格的人。素無聲望的人家。且不必說。但到底是一個閥閱人家的千金小姐。被人强奸。就此不聲不響馬馬虎虎了結。恐怕終有些難。爲　罷。</p>
<p>現在看報的人，程度眞高，往往不去看正面，偏要去找反面，不但要去看反面，並且還要拿事實來印證，眞是討厭得很，其實呢，這也是無非自尋煩惱罷了，最好的辦法，還是「委天任運。」「任人擺布。」所謂不痴不聾，不作阿家。翁，這是我們做小百姓的應有之態度，倘然你要學乖，或强作解人，偏要打穿。他們的後壁，但是你到底無法補救，無法反杭，白白哩自討苦吃。</p>
<p>閒話少說，國事要緊，現在平津如此吃緊，而聞得某分會會長一到，居然。平津人心大定，日本進攻的形勢頓然和緩下來，正如火熱症。吃了一服清凉散。，使人通體爽快，眞有意想不到的效力。</p>

<p>朦朧中被扣門聲驚醒，睜開眼來，已是日影滿窗，朋友跳進門來說：「萬華樓的餚要賣完了，快起來喝早茶去。」</p>
<p>從萬華樓出來，我們步行到金山，時光已近正午，太陽曬到身上，我們把上衣御了，拭着汗大步前進，新的環境確使我忘了掉在上海的悲哀。</p>
<p>金山寺没有杭州的靈隱那般壯麗，大槪爲了白蛇傳水漫金山的故事因而得名。山下有法海洞，據說法海得道的所在，恐怕也是僧人歛財的工具，整箇金山並不如牠的名字那樣使人高興，登金山搭，極目四望，能見白線般的長江，金山的頂點就在這裏了。我們坐在塔頂，披襟當風，由朋友指點我那是焦山，那是甘露寺丨在我們預算之中，就是下半天的遊程，爲了僱不到遊船，我們改遊紫竹林及昭慶寺。對於焦山，甘露寺，金山塔上的一瞥，已後會無期了。</p>
<p>由金山寺前進，經過楊柳夾道的曲徑，直抵天下第一泉。僧人殷勤的招待，天下第一泉冽而且厚，沁人心脾。一行四人，和那主持的僧人講着不三不四的鎭江話，忘其所以的坐上兩個鐘頭。可惜我不能終老是鄕，每天清茶一壺。與老僧作齊東野談。</p>
<p>午後委黄包車遊紫竹山，那是一條鎭江新築的汽車道。車出城後，平坦的大道，像埋在萬山的中間，車蜿蜒的前進，望着那永遠走不盡的大道，坐在車上像做夢似的渺茫。</p>
<p>紫竹林建築在山窪之中，從平地上望去，僅是參天的古木而已，尋石級而上，廟基靠着山勢漸漸增高，最高處爲挹江亭，從這里遙望，遠勝金山寺多多：因爲近處都是不知名的小山，清幽出</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>俗，隱隱的鐘聲過處送來，我們坐在挹江亭上不想跑路。</p>
<p>「蘋，這裏療癢肺病很好，可以向方丈借一間小屋，兩個月後使你的夫人不認識你」。朋友說。</p>
<p>我没有回答，注視着前面，其實並没有瞧見什麽，眼前僅是一方推不開的黑雲。</p>
<p>Ｃ雖然是嬉皮笑臉慣的，但在這樣的塲合，他特别靈敏，見這不妥洽的空氣將開始，拉着我的手說；「快些遊罷昭慶寺，到寳塔林點曲子去。」他還學着洋涇浜的鎭江話，在勉强的笑聲中我們再在大道上前進。</p>
<p>但朋友的那句話還在耳畔和車輪合奏。要人們出高貴的房金生假病，甚至還有中國醫不好的病親躬到外國去，我在車上想起我弟弟的話「窮人不能生病，生病不是窮人！」</p>
<p>自己負病工作，弟弟負病讀書，掉在上海的悲哀，重回到我的記憶裏。對於昭慶寺，我僅是從石級爬上爬下而已。</p>

<p>— 白匐</p>
<p>雖然島國的皇家軍還没有打到北平，但我們北平的有智識的憂國志士，早就把那些貴重的圖書，儀器，標本整批整批的運到南方來了，有些學校也整個的移到南方安全的地帶來讀書了。靠天靠菩薩，他們總算安然退出了。我相信，如果北平搬得動的話，他們一定會把整個的北平搬到南方來。</p>
<p>在這許多的志士們安然後退的時候，獨有北平圖書館不搬，牠總算是一個强者。但不搬的原因，據館長先生說，第一因爲圖書太多，搬不勝搬。第二因爲北平有許多文人志士，要靠他的圖書館來吃飯。在他的圖書館裏抄了書寫成文章，送到報館書局裏去，就可以弄到飯吃。他把圖書一搬走，這班文人志士的飯碗便被他帶走了，而有失業之慮。第三是，我們館長以爲就是島國的皇家軍打到北平來，也祇是政治問題，與文化無關。皇家軍不見得就會破壞他的文化機關丨丨那所文人志士們靠牠吃飯的圖書館。是的，亡國也眞是爲了政治問題。也許皇家軍到了北平的時候，非但不會毁壞他的文化機關，而且要傳令嘉奬我們的館長。因爲他保持文化有心，没有把圖書搬走。</p>
<p>然而北平圖書館總要比那些没有見了皇家軍就駭得溜的志士們强。這些，我們姑且不說，單說那些準備安然退出的憂國志士們。據報載，從前的勞働大學，自經敎育部組織保管委員會以來，久未有處置辦法，北平國立各校，以平津日危，紛紛派代表到京，向敎育部請求指撥勞大校址，爲各校南遷之用，在南方的國立某大學圖謀該校前途發展，亦派代表向敎育部懇洽，各方爭持多日………云云。乖乖，這一塊小小的國土，就有勞我們的愛國志士，知識份子們，紛紛爭持了多日。這其間雖然没有動刀動槍，然而唇槍舌劍的往復，也許就要爭到唇焦舌敝。可是在這一塲紛紛爭持不下的舌戰之後，北平的憂國志士，那些敎育家！失敗了，因此他們怏怏的回到北平，據說，他們因爲時局緊張，平津危急，要提前放暑假了！</p>
<p>那一塊小小的國士，終於是屬於某某大學和西北農林專科學校的了。除掉北平諸憂國志士怏怏不樂外，小子對於西北農林專科學校分得這一塊小小的國土，也深致不滿。據說西北農林專科學校，也是敎育界的憂國志士們，鑑於東西之淪亡，想及早就去開發西北，以固國防的，顧名思義，西北農林專科學校，旣以開發西北爲職志，就歷該辦到西北去。不料他們却一意要爭到洋人充斥的上海來。上海除早已有我國的貴同胞們，在幾千百年之所就開關外，加以洋人的辛苦經營：如今馬路四通八達，大厦連雲櫛比，成了世界上的大商埠之一。難道還需要我們西北農林專科學校的憂國志士們來關闢麽？也許是上海五方雜處，爲也西文開薈萃之處，商業旣然臻於世界大商埠之到，大中小學校也就爲今國之冠，這是中國近代文化的中心。西北農林專科學校也　我們中國新興文化事業之一，自然也得辦到文化中心的地帶　來，藉以宣揚中華民族文化之盛吧？</p>

<p>司愛之神偉呂斯近來很厭煩，她想；「我是神呀！怎麽可以像機械船一天不停地工作的呢」她的工作：當然是引接人類男女間的「愛的金線」：可是近來因爲人間盛倡自由戀愛，以致她的工作，絕不像先前那麽閒散了。她想減輕工作，不惜向世間的男子們懇求般的說：</p>
<p>「全世界的男人們呀，我請求你們！再不要愛那些妖魔式女子吧！他們是會吸盡你們的血吮盡你們的力，和吃盡你們偉大的氣質的。」</p>
<p>她又向世間的女人們說：</p>
<p>「全地球溫存美麗的女人呀！勸你們以後再不要愛那些流氓式的男子們好不好呢！他們是將會摧殘你們的美麗，束縛你們的意志，剥奪你們的自由的；他們像煞一個捕鳥者，祗要你愛上了他們中之一個，那就中了他的阱，你們整個地會變成他的所有物的。」</p>
<p>可是，世間的男女們，像没有聽到她的勸告似的，仍是熙熙攘攘地互相愛着，追求着愛的滋味，戀愛的事件，不但没有絲毫减少，反而天天地增加，愛神是大大地失望了；她所期待看的閒散，不會見諸實現，她是又氣憤，又厭倦，丨丨最後她决計消極的怠工。</p>
<p>從此之後，雖然愛神偉呂斯還在行司她的職務，但决不像先前的認眞了，她常常將愛情的線頭接錯或是中途搖斷，使世間的少男少女們因此而感得不知多少的苦悶和煩惱。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是烟紙店裏，滿師才一月的小夥計。上星期裏，遭遇了一椿極不幸的事情，使我不能自白。有一天早上，店東命我去拆小洋（雙毫）一百元；這是近來很普通的事情。我就將鈔洋點清，望短衫袋裏一塞，就出門去了。經過麥家圈，轉灣向帶鈎橋而來；到了目的地，我就向衣袋裏探取鈔票。不知不摸猶可；這一摸的結果，使我不由自主地哭了。原來我短衫上的衣袋，已經壞了三分之二，祗有二只袋角，還與衣服的本身相連，下面是完全脫離關係了。當時我不知底細，將鈔洋放在裏面，走到路上，所以遺失了。眼見拆小洋是拆不成了，祗得邊哭邊尋的回到店裏；將實情告知店東。那知老板聽到了這個消息，絲毫没有原諒我的口氣；將我大大訓責了一頓，還呌保人寫信給我父親，没法接洽賠償。我父親是在漢口軍醫處當一個下等書記，每月祗有十餘元的收入，還不夠逐月的開支，那裏有錢來替我認這筆賠賬呢！這件事，眞不知怎樣解决呢？所以這幾天，弄得我寢食不安。先生，這件事究屬應該怎樣解决，請你在短時間内，給我一個回音。此請撰安</p>
<p>莊子培謹上</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>編者按：這件事，論理應由莊君負</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>責賠償。因爲店東用了夥計，當然有呌他去辦事的權利；倘使夥計把他職責内應行保管的財物，遺失後可以不負賠償責任，那末這社會的局面，就不能維持下去。不過照來信看來，莊君的店東，態度很好。他的「没有原諒的口氣，」「大加訓責；」這是在一般人都不能免的。他呌保人寫信給你父親，「設法接洽賠償」；雖則以賠償爲目的，但是旣有「接洽」兩字，數目上就有商量餘地；旣有「設法」兩字，交欵的時期和方法，就有伸縮的可能。我們以爲，你也得請你的父親出來，在這「接洽」「設法」四個字上去進行交涉。數目方面，懇求打個折扣；時間方面，要求定一可行辦法，已算是店東的寛大了；要想根本不賠，是做不到的。來日方長，你的前途，究不止値一百塊錢呢！</p>
<p>於此我們要警告一般店員，對於職務内經手的財物，務必小心謹愼。因爲一旦受了損失，即使明知不是你侵佔的，無論在法律上，或人情上，都逃不了賠償的責任。</p>
<p>末了我們還要向大衆說，「對於他人的遺失物，不應該據爲已有。」你要知道，在你方面，原來是意外之財，得不到也能過去；在遺失者方面，每每會因此而陷於絕境。侵佔遺失物，在法律方面，比了竊盜罪輕。但是從道德方面看來，反比竊盜罪重。因爲竊盜的被損害人，大半爲資産階級，而遺失者，則往往包括像莊君般的窮小子在的。被盜的責任，可以用「不可抗力」四字卸脫；而遺失的責任，則百喙難辭也。</p>

<p>十二　生活的片斷之三</p>
<p>春天的下午，暖和的陽光溫軟的瀉進來，最容易使人懶綿綿的疲倦乏力。柳姑娘大槪是因爲過於悶熱的原故，總算是又醒了一次。她無力的將身體移動一下，覺得全身是濕潮潮的，滿身是汗。她伸出手來撳了幾下電鈴，一股凉風透入被裏，接上是一陣激烈的咳嗽，直到女僕荷香走進來的時候，她發見了在痰裏又有鮮紅的血絲。</p>
<p>荷香走近她的床邊，眼睛裏似乎充滿了熱情，只見她眼角邊掛着淚珠，微開着嘴唇壓在枕上喘氣。荷香的確有一付好心腸，自上一個月柳姑娘開始咯血以來，便爲她暗暗的担心，甚至於不只一次。不過現在也不大勸她了，因爲有幾次很誠懇的說過幾回，柳姑娘總是笑笑的，顯然的並不將自己的話放在心裏，而且有一次甚至於苦笑着回答她說：</p>
<p>「别　囌了，我懂得你　好意，但是我就聽了你的話，你能夠跟着我過窮日子嗎？傻孩子！」</p>
<p>像這樣的話，雖然並不是駡她，可是總有一點不大受用。所以現在她只是嘆了一口氣走進洗澡間給柳姑娘預備洗澡水了。</p>
<p>柳姑娘坐在浴盆裏，自己看看身上近來的確瘦了許多。於是她立刻回憶起昨夜顧經理的那種瘋狂態度，眼前不覺發黑，但是她立刻要制止這種想念，她將溫水淋着自己的胸膊。</p>
<p>荷香在門上敲了兩下，其後掀開門幕立在房裏。她低聲的說；</p>
<p>「今天張大少爺在九點鐘的時候來過一次，眞是可笑極了，那末早便跑來。後來在十一點鐘的時候又跑來了，一直望裏面闖，說是一定要看看小姐。…………」</p>
<p>「是那一個張大少爺？」</p>
<p>「就是那一次寄過一張照片來的。」</p>
<p>「寄過照片來的？那末照片多極了，我知道是誰呢？」</p>
<p>「那末我去拿來給你看看好嗎？」說着便向外面跑去，可是柳姑娘却喊住了她；</p>
<p>「誰要看呢？我問你顧老爺是什麽時候回去的？」</p>
<p>「大槪是十一點鐘的光景。他敎我别驚動小姐。他走到門口，張大少爺剛好進來。」</p>
<p>當柳姑娘坐在梳裝台前面對着鏡子的時候，她掛起那串顧行長最近送給她的珠項圈。平心說，像她昨夜那般被蹂躪的程度，這樣的一串珠　，的確不是過分花費的。</p>
<p>忽然　下一陣電話的鈴聲，接上是女　們的快樂的譁笑。其後荷香走進來說：</p>
<p>「小姐丨那個姓張的又打電話來了，說是馬上要來拜訪小姐。」其後她又連上說：「像這樣的男人眞是少見。可是人到是頂漂亮的哩。她們都說又是年青，又是好看。」不久，她巧妙的笑着走出去了。</p>

<h3 id="c255">梅威斯德的私人生活 <a href="#c255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— 文瑛</p>
<p>標榜性惑的拍拉蒙女星</p>
<p>地獄之花中之浪漫主角</p>
<p>近日在光陸蘭心兩院放映的「地獄之花」，在美國曾轟動一時，而使影界有ＧoＷest的口號，當然一般人已爲牠的主角梅威斯德ＭaeＷest傾倒的了。梅威斯德的作風，在美國的影界，已别創一格，足以警駭一般道學先生而顚倒一般豋徒子。她完全超過了香艶肉感的抽象範圍，而專以性的實質誘惑一般男子。而據一般觀察得來的Ｃonviction，梅威斯德所欲打動的目標；還不是那種細皮嫰肉的翩翩少年，而是中年以上，飽經蒼桑的Ｈard－Ｂoileo男子丨她自己已屆中年，而作派又極Ｈard－Ｂoiled的。她在「地獄之花」「片裏扮的ＬadyＬow，有肥大的乳房，有更豐腴的臀部，這些都不是少年男子所眞正需求的丨他們所要的，還不過是秀麗的面龐和苗條的身段呀！</p>
<p>這裏所說的話，當然不是道學先生們所願討論的，因爲梅威斯德和道學先生們，根本係勢不兩立的。梅威斯德在美國和道學先生們已曾有過多少次的接觸，但梅已今還是我行我是，毫不改弦易轍而些微表示屈伏。梅威斯德的口號係「給他儘量的性，也不是簡單平凡的性，而是梅威斯德派的。」所以她在舞台上，或銀幕上，都以性惑爲前提。她因爲表演性惑，不容於小城市的道學派，或敎會派，所以在黑井島上，被監禁了十天；她所演的許多政舞劇，被禁的被禁，被拘的被拘。她儘有逃罪的機會，但她俯首帖耳地，走進監獄門。她的理由是監禁成就了她的名氣。果然的，她的事跡，美國全國報都紛紛爭載，她的好名心，總算因此而滿償了。</p>
<p>但據說梅威斯德本人的天性，並不是這樣淫蕩浪漫的，猶之她在銀幕上，人家看了她豐肥的身體，足足有一百六十磅，但其實她不過一百十八磅重，其餘的却是拍拉蒙衣飾替她裝扮的。她等到離開了覷院與人羣，回到她秘密的私寓，她就恢復了她的本來面目，她還不過一個平常的婦人！並没有什麽過份Ｈard－Ｂoiled的地方。她亦能嬌嗔或悲泣，亦很富於情感，並不怎樣刁鑽古怪。她惟一的嗜好是鑽石。常常手指上，頸項上，以及胸脯上，掛滿上光怪陸離的東西，比狗頸所帶的領圈上的銅釘還多！</p>
<p>梅是有丈夫的。她的丈夫呌傑姆斯提蒙呢，是紐約一位有名的律師，富有機警才能。提蒙尼和梅威斯德都是紐約生長的，都是出身寒微的。梅的最初認識提蒙尼，是由於梅的請敎提蒙尼解决一椿小案件。他們認識之後，就如磁石之與鐵屑，牢粘而不可分了。</p>
<p>梅除演戲之外，還能著作，常常因爲編稿人的底本，不够性惑的程度，而將稿底竄改，或完全更易，以求適合自己的身份。這亦有提蒙尼的不少帮助的地方。而梅威斯德的成名，大半亦由於提蒙尼竭力贊助之功居多。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c256">評「覺悟」 <a href="#c256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— 燕南</p>
<p>如果觀衆不是健忘的話，一定會覺得這一張「覺悟」的影片，是脫化於詹寗氏的「父之罪」（ＴheＳin　of　Ｆather）。中央電檢會褒奬的原因，也就是因爲這影片的各方面都超過了任何小公司出品的紀錄。在這一點上，我的確覺到中國影界大部份的趨向，是走到光明的路上去。</p>
<p>故事是說一位村姑認識了一個小學敎員。後來她因爲父母的强迫婚姻，就不顧一切的和他跑到上海來同居了。爲了物質的引誘，那青年又眷着一個舞星，同時他又失業，他就同舞星一同到北平去了。那村姑已生了一個兒子但是無力贍養，她只得去作了舞女，青年在北平被舞星遺棄了，並且被她捲去了一切的財産。他没有法子，只好沿途乞討回到了上海。那時妻子已經下堂，家中只剩了一個六歲的孤兒，他才大大的覺悟了。他用勞力來換衣食，他已成了一個極忠誠的人。他的兒子也得到帮助，出國留學去了。那個墮落的村姑呢，爲了舞客間的衝突，邇帶受了寃枉，因爲她的一個老客人是一個大盜，所以她也被判了十五年徒刑。她期滿出獄，正是她兒子歸國結婚，全家觀衆的時候。青年終忘不了村姑的情愛，他訪得她已淪爲丐流，即刻到雪地裏去携了她回來。</p>
<p>意識上這張片子的確可以作爲青年們的當頭喝棒，仍破了摩登的假面具，揭開了沉醉的迷戀，同時還發揚出倫理和道德，這種體裁，殊不可多得。</p>
<p>導演文逸民可以說比從前進步了萬倍，不過很好一張影片，而不另走新途，襲用舞塲來形容都市，不免落了俗套，技巧上，導演頗得歐美影片的優長，居然毫不牽强。攝影也很好，而能陰陽剛柔，互相調劑。佈景也頗可觀，屋中紙飛布舞，是因爲没有玻瑙棚的緣故，似可原諒，不過也可以說是疏忽，攝影鏡頭雖好，有一點却是全片大病，就是演員們動作太快，走路像跑，字幕不很多，也有不少警句。</p>
<p>表演以范雪朋最好。表示一個村姑所受的痛苦，努于對于摩登的嚐試，非常動人。特别是「覺悟」以後的懺悔，頗有含蓄配角因爲比較之下，相形見拙，其實都很好。</p>
<p>這片子因爲能夠有諷刺的能力，所以牠不失爲佳作。</p>
<p>嚴格的說意識上，技巧上，還有不少些小的漏洞，爲了維護國片丨特别小公司出品丨起見，我所以不提了，大致上呢？凡是有興趣于國片的人，都可以覺得牠不錯吧。</p>

<p>當然，我們得承認，鮑維爾的表演技巧，確能獨當一面，而在影片中担任着主角的角色　即以這「女人與珍寳」爲例，的確要以他的表演討人歡喜。當他帶領許多强盜在珠寳店肆搜掠的時候，他是那樣的機警靈活，同時也倜儻風流，似乎是要將所謂大盜的特殊風采表現出來。這樣的大盜，我們在銀幕上總看了許多，然而是否就如他所表現的那樣完全一致呢？可惜我們還没有那種經騐，當然不能妄加武斷，然而在Ｒomantic的藝術作品上，常使人們驚嘆不止的。所以鮑維爾在這裏又給與觀衆比較深刻的印象。其後他對女人獻殷勤，拿了許多珠寳在男爵夫人的眼前炫耀，以致於溫柔的定情，關於這些，我們也承認他的「做工」的周到。不過在不懂得「黄金質」的變愛把戲的人們，是不會給他感動的。</p>
<p>記得在幾年以前的默片「繁華夢」中，他曾經飾過一個戴着近視眼鏡而十分忠厚的加油站的小商人，那種忠厚而且誠懇的全部表演，直到如今還使我不會忘記，但是在這裏他却一變而爲風流瀟灑的大盜，然而比較上述的一片却總覺不足。</p>
<p>關於配角，我想没有一一提及的必要。一部好的影片没有好的配角是不會成功的。</p>
<p>然而導演的技巧，也是値得我們注意的。最好的是那些强盜在珠寳店裏搶刧的一個場面。他將那些强盜一個個描寫成精明强幹，同時又不放鬆每一個被刦的人。固然，這些場合完全是在做戲，没有可信的眞實性，然而他能嚴密的注意到極細微的「板眼」，却也不很容易。其次當强盜出現在男爵夫人家裏的時候，有意的擺佈許多疑陣，提高觀衆的緊張的心情，又如把一個嫌疑犯化裝成和大盜彷彿相似，都是導演賣弄聰明的地方。他如導演對於男爵的夫人的譏笑，以及奢侈的暴露，亦可槪見他頗有藝術的修養。</p>
<p>至於故事的本身，很顯明的完全出於虛構，然而在文學上的地位，却有他「譏諷」的特長。不過也祇是對於現實社會出於好意的「嘲笑」，在編劇者的用意，當然是認爲必要的。然而「女人」，「珍寳」，「盜刦」，自然不會因此而改善過來。如此而已。</p>

<h3 id="c258">「脂粉市塲」的我見 <a href="#c258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— 一冰</p>
<p>意識不透切　結構不緊張</p>
<p>確實，近日的國産片已由武俠香艶的體材而轉移到農村方面，都市方面去了。但在最近則又顯然的以婦女解放問題爲影片的對象，這在各公司的廣告上可以看出；而明星公司所攝之「脂粉市場」便是其中的佼佼者。</p>
<p>就全片的意識方面而論，有透切處亦有含糊處。李翠芬是一個尋常的女子，所以在李銘義身死，老母病重，家無炊米的情形下，毅然投身爲女職員，這爲的是什麽？餬口而已，根本没有「認識社會」的絲毫念頭。往後便是翠芬因所受刺激甚深，於是向惡環境奮鬥，卒能開辦一片爲富人享受的小店；固不論事實上是否許可，若是婦女職業而僅是這麽一點點，也就難免管窺蠡測之歉了。</p>
<p>春結稱也不緊張；尤以在末幕國華與翠芬得重見面爲無聊，諒編劇者心中尙存有一絲傳統的「團圓」觀念吧？他如翠芬本一極自重的女子，因不願爲人欺侮戲弄而自動辭職，頗合身分，但後因楊小姐勸以去認識社會，於是再去懇求公司，希望錄用，雖未成功，然面認識社會難道僅有百貨公司一塊地嗎？再若女子職業之種種如接線，抄寫等一幕幕的映過，頗見導演者之匠心；但揷入之處，顯未盡接筍之妙，我以爲全劇之終結處，最好在翠芬說了「咱們還一樣是朋友啊」一包之後。假使在這時黑幕漸漸掛下，那麽觀者的思想中，將要展開着一幅怎樣的景象？惜乎編劇者也忽略了。</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese concession's plainclothes teams were originally scheduled to riot on the evening of the 18th. Symbols and weapons had been distributed. They were divided into three routes: one to attack the Public Security Bureau, one to attack the Provincial Government and Military Headquarters, and one to attack the Guard Battalion. A certain country objected, saying that Huang Fu's arrival in Beiping meant there was a solution. However, the leader of the plainclothes teams, a certain Shi, said, "You have a solution, but we don't!" and insisted on launching the riot. After 10:00 PM on the 18th, the Japanese concession police all withdrew, replaced by Japanese military police and Japanese police on duty. The atmosphere was unusually tense. The riot was scheduled for 3:00 to 4:00 AM on the 19th. At 12:00 AM, the password was "Riot," at 2:00 AM the password was "Love the People," and at 4:00 AM the password was "Success."

<p>Several Bombs Dropped at Niulanshan, Shunyi</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese planes flew over Beiping three times this morning, flying from the north and back over the north and south cities. The first time was at 9:20 AM, the second at 10:00 AM, and the third at around 11:00 AM, circling for about an hour. Our anti-aircraft troops fired machine guns and anti-aircraft guns at various locations. The falling bombs injured three civilians. This morning, there were two Japanese bombing planes and one reconnaissance plane. The one that came to Beiping was the reconnaissance plane. The bombing plane flew to Niulanshan in Shunyi County, northeast of the city, and dropped several bombs at around 6:00 AM this morning. (Special dispatch, 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain military organization announced that the planes that arrived in Beiping this morning were indeed Japanese reconnaissance planes.

<p>(Beiping) At 9:15 AM this morning, a strange plane soared at an altitude of about three to four thousand feet and flew over the eastern city.

Reuters staff and others looked at it with binoculars and could see the observer at the rear of the plane. Anti-aircraft guns in various parts of the city of Beiping fired at it when it flew within range, but none hit. A peddler in the western city was injured by fragments of an exploding shell.

<h3 id="e38">The Riddle of the Current Situation <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>Recently, the Japanese side has been vigorously attempting to disrupt North China. Various plans are being hatched, such as establishing a second puppet organization, coercing Puyi to enter the customs, or having the great powers jointly administer the region. Suddenly, rumors of Sino-Japanese compromise are spreading like wildfire. At the same time, Huang Fu, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, has absolutely denied the possibility of compromise, saying, "The situation in North China is so critical, how can there be compromise? Who would dare to talk about compromise?" His tone is firm, so we should believe that the talk of compromise is just a rumor.</p>
<p>However, observing the facts of recent days, we feel as if we are lost in a fog. Before the 17th, when our army was "withdrawing for strategic reasons to deploy new positions," the enemy army advanced fiercely like a storm. The situation in Peiping and Tianjin was extremely dangerous. The wind howled, the grass and trees seemed to be soldiers, and people were terrified. The whole country was shaken. However, after Huang Fu arrived in Peiping, the front line immediately entered a state of ceasefire. The enemy army stopped advancing, and the people of Peiping and Tianjin also felt "greatly relieved." According to reports, Huang Fu said that his trip was primarily to stabilize the morale of the people of North China. Now that he has succeeded, it seems that he has at least obtained the enemy's "understanding." Otherwise, how could Huang Fu's arrival in Peiping have suddenly caused the advancing enemy to halt? However, the rumors of compromise are indeed just rumors. This is why we find it puzzling.</p>
<p>Our country today lacks organization and strength. Some people believe that "resistance today is a meaningless sacrifice." We believe this is only a one-sided view. But what has led to this situation? It is the endless civil wars in recent years, political corruption, the inability to unite internally in the face of great disaster, and the indifference to the strong enemy. Those who compete for power and profit remain as before, and those who sing and dance merrily remain as before. What more can we say about this? However, our people are still seeking to strengthen themselves and are determined not to give up.</p>
<p>Moreover, recently, the authorities have often compared the gravity of the national crisis to a fire pit, saying that they themselves will jump into the fire pit. This statement seems right but is actually wrong. The so-called jumping into the fire pit is acceptable from an individual perspective. But today's problem is how to get our nation out of the fire pit. If everyone jumps into the fire pit, then there will only be mutual destruction. Those who jump into the fire pit will only drag others into the fire pit. Our people are already in deep water and burning fires. Today's demand is to get out of the water and fire and onto a comfortable mat, to figure out how everyone can jump out of the fire pit. If the authorities truly have a way to get everyone out of the fire pit in North China, then the people's hearts will naturally be stable. If the authorities temporarily jump into the fire pit, we will regard them as living Buddhas. Why worry about rumors?</p>
<p>Roosevelt's Peace Appeal</p>
<h3 id="e39">Our Country Accepts in Full <a href="#e39" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c39" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">39</a></h3>
<p>Reply Sent Yesterday, to be Announced Today</p>
<p>Two Points: Troops Not Crossing Borders, Military Preparations Not Expanding</p>
<p>Japanese Government Expresses Unwillingness to Agree Unconditionally</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The government's reply to President Roosevelt's appeal was meticulously drafted on the 19th. On the evening of the 19th, a telegram in the name of Chairman Lin was sent to President Roosevelt. The full text will be announced on the 20th. Before the official announcement of the reply, the authorities will not issue any opinions. (19th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Lin's reply to the US President is clear and simple. In addition to abstractly expressing full agreement with the four points of Roosevelt's proposal, he particularly praises the fourth step proposed by Roosevelt: that countries around the world should participate in a solemn and definite non-aggression pact, and each country should promise not to send armed forces of any nature beyond its borders. The actual problems of Japan's invasion of our Northeast four provinces and its attack on various parts of North China were not clearly mentioned. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The newspaper on the 19th reported that Foreign Minister Luo had made a statement on the matter. According to Foreign Minister Luo, at the request of a certain American newspaper, the Foreign Ministry issued a short statement in English on the 17th in the name of the Foreign Ministry spokesman, saying that President's declaration is a brave and powerful call for political and economic peace in the world. The reports in today's newspapers are either interpretations of that English statement by a certain agency, but it already has great differences from the original text.

The reply concludes by stating that the Italian government is prepared to join the United States and other governments in pursuing the realization of the US proposals in the most effective way possible.

<p>(Tokyo) Today, according to political circles here, Japan seems likely to endorse President Roosevelt's proposal in principle, but because of the abnormal state of affairs in neighboring countries, it will attach important reservations. Japan seems set to firmly declare that provocative weapons such as boycotts should be banned first, and then Japan can agree to unconditionally endorse the proposal. As for the issue of troops crossing borders, if the world is prepared to recognize the Great Wall as the border between China and "Manchukuo," then Japan can naturally agree. (19th Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) There are two points in President Roosevelt's peace appeal that the Japanese government finds difficult to accept: one is maintaining the status quo and not expanding military preparations, and the other is not crossing borders to advance troops. Because these two major principles are indeed contrary to Japan's continental policy, the Japanese government is unwilling to accept them unconditionally, but it cannot refuse, so it intends to accept them with conditions attached. It is reported that the conditions of reservation planned by the Japanese government are: (1) Recognizing "Manchukuo" as an independent country and drawing the Great Wall as the border between China and "Manchukuo"; (2) Permanently prohibiting China from boycotting Japanese goods. If these two conditions are accepted by the world, then Japan's national policy will not be hindered in any way. If "Manchukuo" is recognized as an independent country, Japan can expand its military preparations as much as possible in the name of "Manchukuo," and if China agrees to abolish the boycott of Japanese goods, Japan's demands will be fully achieved. Within these twenty years, Japan's internal situation will not have the extra strength to invade mainland China, so there is no need to cross borders to advance troops. It is heard that the Japanese Foreign Ministry is drafting a reply based on these two principles, submitting the original proposal to the Army and Navy Ministries for review, and then holding a joint meeting of the three ministries before sending a telegram reply to the US President. It is heard that the wording of the reply is very tactful, expressing its true intentions with the following words: (1) The purpose of the peace guarantee treaty promoted by the United States is only to promote the spirit of the Kellogg-Briand Pact. The Kellogg-Briand Pact recognizes the right of self-defense of all countries, and the new treaty should also recognize the right of self-defense of all countries. The Japanese government has never changed its position on this point. (2) Maintaining the status quo of military preparations is not a new proposal, and it is believed that it cannot prevent the expansion of military preparations permitted by the Washington Naval Treaty. (3) The principle of not crossing borders to advance troops should be limited to the nature of aggression. The dispatch of troops based on treaty obligations (such as the Japan-"Manchukuo" Protocol stipulating joint Japan-"Manchukuo" defense) and the advancement of troops to maintain order (such as invading Shanhaiguan) are naturally not subject to restrictions. Japan uses the above interpretations as principles that the new treaty should recognize, so there is no need to take a confrontational attitude. (19th China United Press dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) President Roosevelt's letter to 54 countries has been sent by the British government to the Prime Ministers of various autonomous territories for review.

<p>(Washington) It has recently been heard that British Prime Minister MacDonald may draft an agreement, including the US President's recommendations. It is said that Prime Minister MacDonald, after his frank talks at the White House, has fully understood the US President's intentions. The State Department is currently eagerly awaiting replies from Soviet Russia, Japan, and South American countries before considering the non-aggression and consultation conventions in Geneva. According to the replies from the thirteen European and American countries to date, none have mentioned any international disputes. The US President's original telegram also did not mention them, but the White House and the State Department are also well aware that such disputes are sufficient to hinder the replies of several countries. Therefore, it is expected that if an agreement is concluded in the future to accept not sending troops abroad, otherwise, the claim of recognizing the country as an aggressor must contain the words "henceforth," because officials all believe that troops already outside the country cannot be withdrawn immediately. As for today's Japanese Ambassador Debuchi's statement that Japan has no intention of advancing to the Peiping-Tianjin area, a good impression has been generated here. It is expected that there will be more clarifications of the situation in the near future. Therefore, US officials are currently awaiting further statements from the Japanese government. People in Washington are even more convinced that the situation in North China can be expected to not expand further because of the news that Chinese Finance Minister Song Ziwen will go to the White House again tomorrow afternoon to meet with the US President.

<p>Japanese Ambassador to the US Broadcasts Atmosphere</p>
<p>Says Japan Has No Intention of Occupying Peiping and Tianjin</p>
<p>San Francisco Japanese representative Viscount Ishii gave a speech to the members of the Chamber of Commerce at the "Federal Club," saying that the recent talks by representatives of various countries in Washington were more than enough to clarify the international atmosphere and eliminate suspicion among countries. He also said that President Roosevelt has great foresight and is worthy of admiration. The points on which Japan and the United States cannot coordinate are few in number. In terms of commerce, Japan ranks third among American cargo customers, second only to the United Kingdom and Canada. Conversely, the United States is also one of Japan's most important customers. Therefore, in addition to some unimportant goods, the commerce between the two countries can supplement each other without competing with each other. On other issues, there are also very few cases where the major interests of the two countries conflict with each other. Japan is working hard to respect American interests in China, Manchuria, and Korea. Japan's overpopulation and the immigration problem are originally very serious, but Japan still respects the United States' views on Japanese immigration to the Americas. (18th Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, after Japanese Ambassador Debuchi visited US Undersecretary of State Phillips, he told reporters that Japan has no intention of entering the Peiping-Tianjin area. People here generally expect that Debuchi has already received new instructions from the Japanese government, so he visited the Undersecretary of State to clarify the situation in North China. According to Debuchi, he hopes to find a way to allow the Japanese army to withdraw immediately, but Debuchi did not say whether this method is already being negotiated, only falsely claiming that Japan recognizes the Great Wall as the boundary between China and "Manchukuo." Japan has long intended to withdraw its troops outside Shanhaiguan, but every time it attempts to withdraw its troops, it is repeatedly stopped due to pressure from the Chinese side. It is heard that Debuchi also discussed Japan's attitude towards the US President's non-aggression pact and general disarmament proposal during his meeting with Phillips.

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Home Affairs recently issued an order to protect and monitor foreign nationals residing in Japan. Japanese police and military police have always monitored the comings and goings and activities of foreign nationals, conducting secret and regular investigations of servants employed by foreign nationals. This monitoring will be further strengthened in the future, fearing that foreigners are acting as spies, especially fearing communist and anti-Japanese propaganda. This kind of monitoring may also contain the role of protecting foreign nationals, because since the activities of Japanese nationalists, incidents such as Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations and the abolition of the Japan-India Commercial Treaty, preparations are being made for an exclusion of foreigners, and the danger of an exclusion of foreigners can actually happen at any time. Therefore, the act of protecting foreign nationals is also necessary. (19th Havas dispatch)</p>

<p>Before the Opening of the World Economic Conference</p>
<h3 id="e61">First Seek to Stabilize Currency Values <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Break Down Obstacles to the Discussion of Tariff Issues</p>
<p>England, America, France, and Germany Have Obtained Considerable Understanding</p>
<p>British King's Speech Will Be Broadcast Globally</p>
<p>(Washington) According to reliable sources, the rulers of the world's major financial countries are currently attempting to stabilize exchange rates, intending to complete the work before the opening of the World Economic Conference. This move is a direct result of the US President inviting politicians from various countries to meet. This movement is currently being led by US President Roosevelt, British Prime Minister MacDonald, French Prime Minister Daladier, Italian Finance Minister Junger, and German Deutsche Bank President Schacht. Although Japanese representative Ishii has not yet met with the US President, it is said that today, when Japanese Ambassador Debuchi visited Undersecretary of State Phillips, he indicated that Japan would join this group and advocate stabilizing the exchange market at prices close to the current exchange rate. It is expected that when the US President meets with Ishii in the future, this will be the first topic to be considered. According to what has been heard here, there has been considerable progress in terms of a general understanding among countries. When President and Prime Minister MacDonald first met, they decided that unless some understanding was reached before the World Economic Conference, the issue of exchange rates would be enough to hinder free and direct discussions on tariff issues. After several talks with MacDonald, they both felt that the exchange market and wheat prices were the two major obstacles to the conference, so they decided to attack these two issues first before the conference opened. Afterwards, politicians from other countries also agreed to this proposal. Therefore, the issue of wheat prices will also be raised at the Central European Grain Conference to be convened in Rome, Romania, on June 3. The conference will ask the representatives to discuss and adopt a method of managing production and prices, and the scope will be expanded. Representatives from all major wheat-producing countries will attend, and issues such as organizing or averaging grain tariffs and agreeing on export quotas that can be accepted by everyone will also be discussed.</p>
<p>▲ Washington Telegram from the National News Agency on the 19th. Today, the US President and Mexican Finance Minister Bini discussed stabilizing currency values for a long time, especially focusing on increasing the status of silver, because both countries are major silver producers. Afterwards, they issued a joint communique stating that the two countries will fully cooperate on economic and financial matters at the World Economic Conference. They also said that the two sides had a very successful discussion on the issue of stabilizing silver prices.</p>
<p>(London) When the British King gives his opening address at the World Economic Conference in London on June 12, he will issue the world's largest radio broadcast. The British King's speech will be transmitted from the Southern Gamsington Geological Museum to the Philadelphia International Telephone Bureau, and from there to the capitals of various European countries. As for the British Empire and the Americas, they can also hear the British King's speech from Rugby. It is estimated that all countries other than China and Japan can also hear this broadcast.

<p>American Representative Formally Proposes Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<p>Rumors of a Meeting Between French and German Prime Ministers in Geneva</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's General Commission meeting of the Disarmament Conference, Chairman Henderson spoke, urging all representatives to compromise with each other and strive to conclude a convention. Henderson praised President Roosevelt's declaration, stating that it greatly contributed to the work of the Disarmament Conference. He then cited German Chancellor Hitler's speech on Wednesday, indicating that the German Chancellor now urged the Disarmament Conference to consider President Roosevelt's declaration with sympathy. After the Chairman's speech, German Representative Nadolny stated that Germany had decided to accept the disarmament plan proposed by British Prime Minister MacDonald. Nadolny, on behalf of the German government, declared acceptance of the British Prime Minister's plan, not only as a basis for discussion but also as the foundation for a future disarmament convention. He believed that this announcement was sufficient evidence of Germany's moderate spirit and willingness to cooperate, and hoped that other countries would also make every effort to adjust their interests within the scope of the British Prime Minister's plan. (Reuters, 19th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Today, the US State Department has instructed Davis, at the Geneva Disarmament Conference, to formally propose a non-aggression pact in accordance with the President's plan. It is reported that the US President's appeal to the heads of state of various countries for peace guarantees will be read at the General Commission of the Disarmament Conference, and Davis will also provide an explanation. Now that President Roosevelt's telegram has been issued, various countries have responded quickly, and the stalemate caused by Germany's demands is also expected to be resolved, which is very gratifying. (National News Agency, 18th)</p>
<p>(Paris) There are rumors that the French and German prime ministers will meet in Geneva next week. If true, the Disarmament Conference will definitely be revitalized. It is said that close friends of French Prime Minister Daladier are now urging the French Prime Minister to strive to meet with the German Prime Minister, as this is the best way to clarify the tense atmosphere. According to unofficial sources, plans for such a meeting are currently under study. It is now known that US Representative Davis first proposed the meeting between the two prime ministers to resolve the dilemma between France and Germany. The French side has not yet expressed its opinion, but it is generally believed that the French Prime Minister has accepted this suggestion. Since arriving in Europe, US Representative Davis has been engaged in extremely important behind-the-scenes work in international affairs. President Roosevelt's announcement to the world, issued before German Chancellor Hitler's address to Congress, was also at Davis's request. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Disarmament Conference here is currently experiencing difficulties regarding the procedures to be adopted at the General Commission meeting of the Disarmament Conference on May 19th. The German side claims that German Chancellor Hitler has already explained Germany's position, so German Representative Nadolny does not need to make any further statements. Now, the French representative should disclose France's position, but the French side may not be ready to speak immediately, and French cabinet members will not be able to arrive in Geneva before May 19th. Therefore, it is generally expected that British Representative Eden will speak at that time, and Chairman Henderson may also express his views. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) People here now believe that when the Geneva disarmament talks resume, France will not have explained Germany's demand for equality as German Chancellor Hitler explained it. What Hitler explained is that German armaments are completely equal to those of other countries in terms of quality and quantity. If France's explanation is not the same as Germany's, then the difficulties of the Geneva conference will be impossible to eliminate, because Germany has already declared its final word on this matter and cannot continue to make concessions. (Reuters, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The White House and the State Department both exchanged messages with Davis, the disarmament representative in Europe, throughout the day. When the Disarmament Conference meets to discuss, Davis will issue a declaration in the name of the United States. The US government and Davis are exchanging messages to finalize the content of this declaration. Although the disarmament issue has major difficulties in terms of political technology, people in American political circles are still optimistic, believing that within ten days or so, before the London Economic Conference convenes, a convention can be concluded stipulating the first step in disarmament measures. The term will be set at five years, and it will stipulate that after the five-year term expires, Germany will enjoy equal rights to armaments in fact and in law. The general opinion is that the success of the convention depends on two facts: first, Germany sincerely promises to postpone the implementation of the principle of equality in armaments for five years; and second, France recognizes the abandonment of offensive weapons such as heavy artillery, bombing aircraft, tanks, and gas. The general opinion is that since Germany has no offensive weapons, it is materially impossible to cross the French border fortifications. It can be seen from this that the abolition of offensive weapons can obviously enhance France's security. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The General Commission of the Disarmament Conference will meet at 3:30 pm. Chairman Henderson will first present recent events, then praise President Roosevelt's declaration, and mention Hitler's speech. Then, he will ask the Disarmament Conference to resume work and conclude as soon as possible. US Representative Davis will respond on behalf of President Roosevelt. German Representative Nadolny arrived here by plane at 10:00 this morning, seemingly wanting to reiterate certain parts of Hitler's speech in a "Geneva-style tone." Nadolny will also invite delegations from various countries to explain their opinions separately. British Representative Eden met with Henderson this morning, and he may deliver a speech. It is generally speculated that Germany will use a means, supported by Italy, to force Britain and France to reciprocate with corresponding sacrifices for "Germany's concessions." (Havas, 19th)</p>

The Central Committee of the Fascist Party will meet tomorrow afternoon to determine Italy's foreign policy. Goering's trip will exchange views with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini on Chancellor Hitler's disarmament policy. Since President Roosevelt's application was published, people's hearts have been calmed, and the Four-Power Pact plan may be reintroduced. (Havas, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Herriot expressed his opinion today, saying that he believes that after Germany demands equality in the army, it will demand equality in the navy. This can be seen in Hitler's speech to Congress on Wednesday. As for France's reaction to the speech, only actions can prove the sincerity of the German people's verbal desire for peace.

<p>Soviet Russia Allows Pseudo-Organization to Inspect Trains</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday drafted a reply to the note presented by Karakhan on April 16 regarding the Middle East Road dispute and sent it to the Soviet government today. (Dentsu, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The content of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' rebuttal to Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan's protest regarding the Middle East Road dispute is as follows: (1) The Japanese government's policy of justly recognizing the Soviet government's interests in the Middle East Road and respecting Soviet interests after "Manchukuo" remains unchanged. (2) However, the Japanese government is not responsible for the actions of Japanese officials in "Manchukuo." (3) The cause of the Middle East Road dispute is that the Soviet Union has illegally oppressed "Manchukuo" in the exercise of its legitimate rights, so the Soviet Union should reflect on itself. (4) The Soviet Union's protest against Japan regarding the issue of unpaid transportation fees is unreasonable. The purpose of the Japanese army's actions is to protect the Middle East Road, so it should naturally transport Japanese troops free of charge. The transportation fees currently unpaid by the Japanese army are for the transportation of vehicles, horses, and food. After the discount rate is determined, the full amount will naturally be paid. (United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) "Manchukuo" believes that it is necessary to inspect various Soviet trains in Manchuria and requests the Russian side to stop its trains at the Outer Baikal Station for inspection by the Manchurian side.

<p>(Tokyo) Matsudaira, the Japanese ambassador to Britain, reported to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday that, regarding the Indo-Japanese Commercial Treaty issue, Matsudaira and the British Trade Minister, the Matsuyama Business Officer stationed in Britain, and the British Business Officer negotiated separately. As a result, the two sides agreed in principle: (1) In order to revise the overall Anglo-Japanese commercial agreement, a council of commercial and industrial representatives from both countries should be convened to discuss the compromise conditions that both sides should take in trade, and a new commercial treaty should be formulated based on the results of the discussion. (2) The agreement should first determine the number of imports and exports of major trade goods and divide the markets for the goods of the two countries to avoid conflicts between the two countries. Negotiations will proceed according to this principle. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received this news and discussed countermeasures with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry this morning. It will send a telegram to Ambassador Matsudaira within days to put forward specific conditions and then proceed with the second step of negotiations. (China United Press, 19th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Spinning Mill Association held a meeting yesterday to continue deliberating on the Indo-Japanese trade issue. The representatives of the factories present were very angry at Britain's hostile attitude towards Japanese cotton yarn and cloth. While the Indo-Japanese trade issue has not been resolved, British West Fife has announced the abolition of the commercial treaty, challenging Japanese cotton yarn and cloth. Britain has no "sincerity," and Japan should not continue to take a wait-and-see attitude and sit idly by. It must change its attitude from now on and resolve to fight Britain. This morning, Miyajima and others were sent as representatives to visit the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to state the opinions of the spinning mills and urge the government to fight against Britain.

<p>Pengu Claims Efforts to Secure Agreement with Italy</p>
<p>▲Reuters, Paris, 18th - The French Chamber of Deputies unanimously passed a motion tonight, supporting the exchange of ratification documents for the Franco-Russian Non-Aggression Pact signed in Paris on November 29th of last year. Former Prime Minister Herriot and Foreign Minister Pengu both attended and delivered speeches. 520 members of parliament were present.</p>
<p>▲Havas, Paris, 18th - The Chamber of Deputies voted to ratify the Franco-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty resolution. 520 members voted, and all were in favor. The Socialist Party spokesman recognized the treaty as a tool for building peace and therefore also supported the motion. Former Prime Minister Herriot then provided some explanations regarding the Franco-Russian treaty, as he was the one who prepared it and signed it. Herriot said, "This treaty can maintain maximum security and effectively eliminate all economic and political aggression." The Little Entente countries and Romania have all recognized this treaty, so it is clear that its purpose is not to oppose any country. Finally, Herriot explained the immediate effects that the treaty can achieve, namely: (1) Soviet Russia has come forward in Geneva to advocate for the definition of "aggressor nations," and (2) Soviet Russia is therefore opposed to revising treaties. Foreign Minister Pengu followed with a speech, stating that we have great confidence in this treaty and have no reason to doubt the sincerity of the other signatory nation. The government attaches great importance to this treaty, which is evident in the changed attitude of the Soviet representative at the Disarmament Conference. Furthermore, France's traditional policy is to continue expanding the scope of its alliances without abandoning previous alliances. The Non-Aggression Treaty concluded between France and Soviet Russia is fully in line with France's traditional policy. Therefore, the French government is now striving to coordinate with Italy. The Foreign Minister further briefly explained the significance of the Non-Aggression Treaty, stating, "We will not adopt any aggressive attitude towards Soviet Russia, nor will we even take economic measures to jointly exclude Soviet Russia. We will absolutely not interfere in Soviet Russia's internal affairs. We also believe, based on the principle of reciprocity, that the other party will also respect its promises and cease all propaganda against our country's policies. Furthermore, our attitude towards any country's exiles will not be changed because of this." In conclusion, the Chamber of Deputies passed the ratification motion, stating that "the Franco-Russian Non-Aggression Treaty can consolidate peace and promote the common interests of European countries. This Chamber of Deputies accepts the exchange of ratification documents with satisfaction."</p>

<p>— Rate</p>
<p>Forming an Arc-Shaped Position from Gubeikou to Lutai</p>
<p>Weng's Troops Defend Fengrun, Japanese Planes Bombard Heavily</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Peiping reports that our frontline troops have been retreating step by step in recent days, and the Japanese army is advancing steadily. The situation in Peiping and Tianjin is extremely tense, with rumors rampant and everyone on edge. However, the fighting has not been intense. West of Luanzhou is mostly flat terrain, and it is almost impossible to defend against the Japanese artillery fire. After our troops in Tangshan retreated westward, a unit of Japanese cavalry was discovered in the Majiakou area. The situation in Tangshan is unclear, and public order is extremely chaotic. Unscrupulous individuals are taking the opportunity to rob, rape, murder, and commit all kinds of atrocities. Wan Fulin's troops suffered heavy losses due to disrupted communication during the fighting, resulting in each unit fighting on its own. Wan himself has already taken a special train west. His troops are extremely exhausted, and it has been decided to withdraw them to the rear for rest and reorganization in Yangcun, awaiting orders to fight the enemy. He Zhuguo is currently in Lutai, with a portion of his troops remaining on guard near Xugezhuang. Our defense line has been reorganized, forming an arc-shaped position from the Gubeikou line to Lutai on the front of the Beining Railway, including Miyun, Pinggu, Jixian, Ninghe, and Lutai, as the foremost line of defense. Since the abandonment of Luanzhou, our army's formation has been renewed. Currently, He Zhuguo's troops are defending the front of the Beining Road, and Wang Yizhe's troops are near Yutian, with considerable strength remaining. As for the Xifengkou line, Song Zheyuan's troops have undergone some changes in their lines due to pressure from the rear, with most of them retreating from Longjingguan and Santunying via Zunhua. Song Zheyuan himself is deploying military forces in Jixian, building new positions between Zunhua and Jixian to continue resisting the Japanese army. The closest line in front of Miyun is still in the Jiusongling area, and there has been no fighting today or yesterday.</p>
<p>Weng Zhaoyuan personally led his troops to defend Fengrun for three days and three nights, eventually withdrawing due to being outnumbered and outgunned. After Weng's troops withdrew, the Japanese army did not dare to advance rashly, sending out advance scouts to reconnoiter. After learning that our troops had retreated, they then drove their army into the city and followed to the east of Yutian, where a small engagement occurred at Liangjiadian. Wang Yizhe's troops are continuing to retreat to the west of Yutian. This reporter went to a Peiping office this morning (the 17th) to gather news and encountered a soldier from Weng's troops who had been slightly wounded on the front line. Disguised as a fried dough stick vendor, he secretly returned to Peiping from Fengrun. According to him, Weng's troops defended Fengrun for three days and nights, with only eighty soldiers in the entire garrison. The Japanese army used fierce artillery fire, attacking the city in shifts. These few defending soldiers were killed and wounded one after another, almost all sacrificing themselves. Only three to five survivors remained. After the Japanese army entered the city, they encountered our wounded soldiers. After inquiring about the situation of the defense, they also sighed and expressed sympathy. They shook their heads in disbelief at the fact that a very small number of people had defended a city for three days. Weng himself escaped alone in a car when withdrawing from Fengrun. He was chased by Japanese planes several times along the way. The road was rugged, and the car traveled slowly on the bumpy dirt road. Weng often got out of the car to push and pull it forward. Later, Weng, fearing danger due to the frequent bombing by Japanese planes, sought another path to escape, thus avoiding disaster. His car driver drove the car back to Peiping this morning. According to him, the Japanese planes bombed the villages near Fengrun indiscriminately, committing inhumane acts. In one place, an old man, seeing a Japanese plane coming, staggered toward a cellar outside the village with his granddaughter. But a Japanese bomb had already arrived. With a loud explosion, they fell to the ground. Grandfather and granddaughter died side by side next to the cellar. A leg flew to the top of a tree, blood dripping and staining the ground red. The corpses were divided into several sections, scattered on the ground. Their clothes were burned by the bomb fire, and a stench filled the air. Passersby covered their noses and passed by. Afterwards, the residents fled, leaving the area deserted, which is also very pitiful. (17th)</p>
<h3 id="e100">Feng Zhanhai's Army Sheds Blood at "Da Liang Di" <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Special Correspondent Guo An</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Zhangjiakou reports that since the Volunteer Army rose up in various parts of eastern Jilin after the September 18th Incident, General Feng Zhanhai, with the strength of a single regiment, called on patriotic volunteers and contacted the Guo, Yao, and other Volunteer Armies, fighting in the vast plains of the Black Water and White Mountains. By the autumn of last year, due to a lack of ammunition and rear support, and under the combined pressure of enemy aircraft and heavy artillery fire, after sacrificing a number of patriots, they finally reached the territory of Rehe Province. Before the rear could replenish ammunition and supplies, the enemy began to attack Rehe. General Feng defended the lines of Kailu and Chifeng, resisting for a week. However, the treacherous actions of Cui and Liu, who had lost their minds and sided with the enemy, affected the overall progress and retreat of the battle. He had no choice but to retreat to Dolon via side roads. The weather was bitterly cold, and the north wind blew snow. The brothers, in single clothing and with iron spears, climbed mountains and crossed ridges, concentrating in Dolon. At that time, the call for the enemy to attack Chahar rose again. Feng's army made some adjustments and prepared to resist. Later, due to extreme material difficulties, Feng's army received orders to temporarily retreat to the rear for reorganization. From then on, the defense of Dolon was taken over by Zhao's Cavalry Army. The outskirts of Guyuan to Dolon were still under defense. Soon, the army was ordered to be reorganized into the □□□ Division. All the original horses were handed over to Peiping, transforming them into infantry. The horses of the army all belonged to farmers in the northeastern countryside. The brothers in the Volunteer Army all came from the countryside, bringing their own guns and horses, and had been fighting bloody battles against the Japanese. Each person's horse was a companion who had worked hard together through life and death. Once they left their horses, many of the brothers shed tears, as if they were parting with family. After General Feng Zhanhai's army was reorganized into the infantry □□□ Army, the places they garrisoned were all in the countryside. However, these anti-Japanese heroes who came from the countryside had very harmonious feelings with the local people. For example, the town of Pingdingpu within the territory of Zhangyuan County has always been protected by the church. No troops could pass through, let alone stay there. However, since Feng's army garrisoned there, the soldiers were disciplined, and the town requested General Feng to station some troops in the town to protect the merchants and residents. General Feng had no choice but to set up a staff office in Pingdingpu Town, in order to facilitate military communication with Guyuan. Therefore, General Feng Zhanhai's subordinates also got along well with the people. After the fall of Dolon, Zhao Chengzhou's five cavalry regiments retreated to Zhangbei County and concentrated there. In this way, the first-line troops were all the □□□ Army. General Feng Zhanhai moved into Pingdingpu to command nearby. On the 4th and 5th, enemy and puppet troops, including Liu Guitang, numbering over 2,000, attempted to attack "Da Liang Di," but were repeatedly repelled by Feng's army. Apart from artillery test shots every day, there was no sign of them moving south. At this time, General Feng believed that there was an opportunity to counterattack, to recover Dolon and consolidate the defense of eastern Chahar. Therefore, he made careful plans. The attacking force consisted of a brigade and two regiments, the brigade commander's surname was Zhao, and the other two regiments were one cavalry and one infantry, with the cavalry regiment commander surnamed Sun, and the infantry regiment commander surnamed Wang. On the night of the 8th, this attacking force, under the command of General Feng, entered the attack preparation position. In addition to a battalion of attached artillery, including mountain, field, and mortar guns, there were also fifteen heavy machine guns, and a large number of light machine guns and automatic rifles. Each soldier was attached with six hand grenades. That night, preparations were completed, and they began to advance and attack at dawn on the 9th. Thus, the bloody battle of "Da Liang Di" began.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>The sound of artillery had already moved and fluctuated with the gray-yellow light of the sky on that vast sandy plain. Army Commander Feng stood resolutely by the earth fortress of the artillery observation post. At this time, the enemy and puppet army was unexpectedly thrown into chaos by the concentrated artillery fire of Feng's army. During that chaotic moment, the enemy and puppet army's mountain and field guns also entered the position, shaking the ground with their bombardment. But under these circumstances, the artillery fire of Feng's army had undoubtedly completed the purpose of suppression fire. Although the enemy frantically fired a barrage of chaotic shots, at this time, the sound of Feng's army's attack advance号suddenly sounded in the yellow sand that covered the sun. Brigade Commander Zhao, holding a broadsword in his hand, urged his brothers forward. The sound of machine guns and rifles was gurgling like boiling water. The enemy and puppet army, watching Feng's army like a tide, although they still dared to ambush in those insecure trenches, after firing a volley of guns into the air, they all rushed to the horse posts, grabbed their horses, and fled towards Dolon. The entire line of the rebel army was shaking. Army Commander Feng saw it very clearly through binoculars. At this time, it was 11 o'clock in the morning. Sun Heqi's cavalry regiment had long been on horseback there, preparing to attack. The order to pursue had just been spoken by Army Commander Feng, but who knew that the broken line of the enemy and puppet army suddenly stopped. It turned out that the Japanese army's reinforcements, sitting in trucks, had rushed from Dolon to reinforce them. So those rebel troops, under the pressure of the Japanese army, had no choice but to turn around and counterattack. At this time, Feng's army's line had already become the pace of attack. Army Commander Feng frowned when he saw this critical situation, and called out for the bugler to continue blowing the charge号. So, the hearts of every younger brother were filled with a chamber of revenge, ready to sprinkle it on this vast battlefield丨Da Liang Di丨. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Researching the Implementation of a Three-Year Governance Plan</p>
<p>With Heads of Military and Civilian Agencies as Members</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province previously formulated a three-year governance plan to be implemented on schedule. However, the beginning of reforms cannot be achieved overnight, and even more so, the implementation requires the cooperation of various military and civilian agencies.

<h3 id="e102">Xuzhou Suffers Torrential Rain Disaster <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>River Waters Overflow, Wheat Seedlings Damaged</p>
<p>County Farmers' Association Submits Petition to County for Relief</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: In recent years, the river channels have been blocked and have long lacked dredging. The residents in the urban area mostly freely fill the river, resulting in a loss of both storage and discharge capacity. Whenever there is heavy rainfall, they suffer from flooding. The torrential rains last summer turned the entire area into a swamp. For the past two years, the authorities have remained indifferent to water conservancy. The rainfall this spring has been more than in previous years. Since the 13th of this month, the heavy rain has not stopped, and today (the 18th) it has still not cleared up. The flood disaster is reported again. According to the investigation, in the first district, the Wenqugou in the city is blocked and impassable. Areas along the river such as the Confucius Temple and Doumu Palace are flooded to the ankles, and transportation is blocked. The Kui River outside the city is overflowing, and the water has flowed back. The amount of water in the former course of the Yellow River has increased sharply. In the second, third, and fifth districts, which are near Weishan Lake, most of the wheat seedlings have been flooded. The water is deeper in the seventh district. Farmlands in the areas of Sanbu Township, Guanqiao Town, Wucun Township, Yuzhuang Township, Zhongshan Township, and Qinzhai Township are flooded, with the water reaching four or five feet deep in low-lying areas. In the eighth district, low-lying fields in Shuanggu Town, Jiuji, Jiazhai, and Dawangji have also been flooded. The twelfth district belongs to the Gaogong River basin. Along the Longhai Railway near Daxujia, the water is one foot deep on the flat ground north of the road. The rainfall this time is very widespread, so the districts have reported disasters one after another. Yesterday, more than a dozen representatives of the disaster-stricken people, including Teng Shaosheng and Liu Guangrun, came to the city to petition the county government, urging them to quickly find a way to provide relief and stating that if the river channels could be dredged, the villagers would be willing to automatically provide labor. The County Farmers' Association also reported the disaster to the county based on the villagers' reports, specifically submitting a document stating, "Submitting a report to relay the disaster situation, earnestly requesting the dispatch of personnel to investigate and coordinate relief to stabilize people's livelihoods. According to Liu Guangrun, the director of the Yumin District Farmers' Association, on the 13th of this month, there was thunder and rain, which did not stop all day. It was even worse in the evening, with torrential rain pouring down. By dawn on the 14th, the water depth in the villages of Sibudun, Sibu Lake, Shanglou, Yanying, Dongshantou, Sanbu, Haihu, Xialou, and Tengzhuang in the southwest of the seventh district was 4 to 6 feet deep on the flat ground, and the wheat seedlings were completely lost to the water. The number of other affected areas is unknown. At this time when the new crop is not yet available, the disaster is sudden, and the farmers are panicked and helpless, appearing to have no way to seek death. Wheat is the people's lifeblood. Once it is flooded, I am afraid that the heavens will stir up thoughts of change, and there will be unrest in social order. I earnestly request that it be quickly forwarded to the county government, sending personnel to investigate and verify, and seek relief, and dredge the river channels to avoid further disasters. Furthermore, according to verbal reports from farmers in other districts who have come to the association one after another, the rainfall this time is extremely heavy, and low-lying fields are all flooded, with the disaster situation being extremely serious. Considering that the national crisis is imminent and banditry is spreading, the rural economy has already fallen into bankruptcy. How can the heavens not have pity and suddenly bring down this calamity? In addition to urging each district by telephone to rush to report the disaster situation in detail, it is appropriate to first prepare a document to forward it for your assessment and approval, and quickly dispatch personnel to investigate and verify and coordinate relief, awaiting orders to the utmost." County Magistrate She Nianci, considering that the disaster situation in the seventh district was particularly serious, took the Jinpu train to Sanbu today (the 18th), got off, and went to conduct an on-site investigation to devise a relief plan. However, the intermittent rain is still a cause for concern. According to the investigation, the main rivers in Xuzhou include the Kui River in the south of the city, which relies on it to discharge the water from the city, the Wangzhou River, which relies on it to discharge the water from the mountains south of the city, and the water from Sibu and Sanbu Lakes also rely on it for discharge. In the north of the city, there is the Jingshan River, which receives water from Weishan Lake and flows down into Pizhou. The Fangting River is used to discharge water from the mountains north of the city. The branches of these main lines have lacked dredging for years. If they are not thoroughly dredged, the flood disaster cannot be eliminated. (18th)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Indictment Filed in the Jiang Pingfan Assassination Case <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Court Prosecutor Indicts for Premeditated Murder</p>
<p>More Than Ten Townships Organize Huang Sandi Support Association</p>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The case of the assassination of Jiang Pingfan, the Superintendent of the Minhai Customs, has been transferred to the Minhou District Court Prosecutor's Office and handled by Prosecutor Xu Guanlan. The investigation has now been completed, and an indictment was filed on the 13th, stating that the murderer Huang Sandi was only back in Fujian from Taiwan for nine days, yet he was able to recognize the victim's chartered car and carried a sharp knife and ash bag, waiting at the scene of the crime for several days. Before the murder, after returning to Fujian, he took a photo in the Guanghua Photo Studio in the costume of a magistrate executing a judge. (According to the plot of this play, a retired judge covets someone's cemetery, forces them to give it up, and then kills them and occupies the land. Later, a new magistrate arrives, learns the truth, and sentences the judge to death as compensation.) Based on the above points, it is concluded that his murderous act was based on the result of deep thought and consideration, and had a definite plan before and after its implementation. He committed the crime of premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code and should be sentenced to death. However, the defendant is a worker with a simple mind, harboring grievances over his father's grave, leading to resentment, which turned into hatred. While his crime deserves punishment, his situation is not without pity. It seems that he should be sentenced in accordance with Article 77 of the same law, which states that if the circumstances of the crime are pitiful, the penalty may be reduced. Currently, the Fuzhou community is paying close attention to this case. Jiang's friends, including Lin Zhiyuan, a member of the Provincial Government Committee, Wang Huaijin, a member of the Provincial Party Headquarters, Lin Yushi, a secretary of the National Government, Shi Jialin, the former Director of the Department of Finance, Huang Zhanyun, the former Director of the Department of Agriculture and Industry, Chen Wei, the captain of the Security Team, and dozens of other important figures in the party, government, and military circles, have initiated the organization of the Jiang Daoyi Comrades Funeral Office to handle the litigation, aiming to achieve the goal of punishing the murderer and avenging the crime. The people of more than ten townships, including Houpu, Qianyu, Xucuo, and Fengban in Dongmen, have also initiated the organization of the Huang Sandi Support Association, submitting public appeals for Huang's defense and raising funds for Huang's legal expenses. The Lawyers Association has also appointed Chen Hengquan, Huang Shang, and Lin Dan to serve as Huang's voluntary defense counsel. The two sides are evenly matched, and the outcome is difficult to predict. (15th)</p>

<p>Cases of robbery and kidnapping in the four townships of this county have been increasing recently. At the beginning of his tenure, Commissioner Jin was very eager to eliminate bandits and maintain local stability. He had repeatedly ordered the land and water police teams to patrol from time to time and had also received a full complement of officers and soldiers of the Sixth Company of the Third National Security Guard sent by the province to Songjiang, in preparation for deployment. But just last night, around twelve o'clock, multiple kidnappers suddenly came to the Peng family, farmers from Shizhuang浜 in Jiaodiaowan. They rushed into the house, dragged away their son-in-law, and robbed him of his clothes before fleeing. The family did not dare to pursue them. The next morning, the local police learned of this, went to investigate, and immediately reported it to their superiors, instructing them to find a way to rescue him.</p>

<p>Wuxi County Magistrate Yan Shenyu believes that the county's defense regiment is related to local security and is determined to thoroughly rectify it, and will not be frustrated by the current achievements. Currently, there are 60 training centers that have been established in the city and countryside, with a total of 2,520 militiamen. In the future, it will be actively expanded to 85 Jia. In addition to reorganizing the merchant regiments, local strong young men will be recruited to serve as militiamen in order to train a strong army to defend the locality. As for the funding issue, in addition to the inherent 21,000 yuan, it has been decided that the store donation will be levied at 10% along with the house donation, amounting to about 50 yuan per year. As for the donations from gentry and wealthy people and special products, it has been decided to postpone the collection for the time being. In addition, the automobile and shipping donations were also decided to be levied first yesterday, and the principles are: (1) 5 Li will be levied per ticket with the ticket price; (2) The two donations are assumed to be 5,000 yuan; (3) Included in the general budget, allocated as the Jia brand business expenses.</p>

<p>At 7:40 PM on the 16th, dark clouds suddenly gathered in Zhezhen Town, and wind and rain swept in, blowing down the houses of seven families, including the Shengpinglou Sauce Garden in Dongzha, injuring more than 70 people and killing five people, including an old woman from the bamboo ware store and an 18-year-old girl from the pastry shop. After the incident, local agencies specially organized a temporary hospital in the Chenghuang Temple to rescue the injured. The disaster caused great losses and was truly a catastrophe for Zhezhen. The other towns of Pingwang and Beizhu were also hit by windstorms. Fortunately, the houses collapsed but no one was injured. In Langdachuan in this city, all the thatched houses of the out-of-town residents were blown down. The long-distance telephone lines from Wujiang to Zhezhen were completely broken, and many of the Suzhou telegraph poles were also blown down. The losses from this incident are shocking.</p>

<p>A railway police officer from the 5th section of the Wuyi Railway Station Police Division arrested a traitor on the evening of the 17th. Upon interrogation, the traitor identified himself as Wang Jinkui. He was carrying a small flag, a mirror, and had a shaved head except for a tuft of long hair on top, about the size of a silver dollar, shaped like a peach. He wore a peaked cap, a gray old coat, and torn shoes. The railway police took him to the division, where he was taken away by the station's military police. The suspect readily admitted to infiltrating the interior as an enemy to gather intelligence. On the 18th, Magistrate Cai brought the suspect to the office for interrogation. The suspect confessed to his past intelligence-gathering activities, including secret codes used by his accomplices, and mentioned visiting Kunshan, Suzhou, Wuxi, and even Changzhou. After the interrogation, he was sent back to the military police camp and will be sent to the Capital Garrison Headquarters for further investigation soon.</p>

<p>The county government received a report from the Daqiao Chamber of Commerce stating that a firewood merchant, Xu Qizhi, hired a sailboat to go to Jiangnan to purchase river firewood. While passing the Sifang Bridge area across from Renfu Township in Xinzhou, they were suddenly attacked by a dozen bandits, all speaking with a Pizhou accent. Armed with knives and clubs, they arrived in two rowing boats and boarded the sailboat to conduct a thorough search, robbing 30 silver dollars. Simultaneously, three Taixing passenger boats were also robbed clean. Fortunately, no one was injured. It has now been discovered that the crime was committed by Xiao Zhang San and ten others who were watching firewood in the area. The Public Security Bureau's detective team was secretly ordered to rush to the scene overnight and arrest Xiao Zhang San, Xiao Liu Kuaizi, Feng Xiaogenzi, Zhang Er, Jing Xiangjiu, Jiang Hongzhi, Wang Qingyuan, Zhang Hongye, and eight others.

<p>The military and police supervisory office here recently cracked down on a large number of traitors in Bengbu. After interrogation, they have been sent to Xuzhou to be dealt with by the Jinpu Garrison Headquarters. According to insiders familiar with the truth from the cracked reactionary organizations, the key arrestees are Ma Yansheng, the head and commander-in-chief of the People's Anti-Japanese National Salvation Army, Zhang Zhongjing, the deputy head, and 14 others suspected of assisting the enemy, including Zhang Xiaolian and Shi Yuewu. Ma and Zhang confessed that they were instructed by a general in Peiping and a chairman of a Buddhist association, but did not mention receiving any official commission. However, based on the facts of secret agent reports and the evidence and testimony, it is believed that the traitors Ma Yansheng and Zhang Zhongjing were indeed swayed by profit and engaged in activities that harmed the country, making them traitors. Their reactionary points are sevenfold: (1) They established titles and summoned bandits without being commissioned by anyone or registering with the government. (2) They created flags and seals without authorization, and the flag style was vastly different from the Party and national flag style. (3) They used cunning names to bewitch the ignorant people. (4) They were instructed by a Siamese named Li Congzhi. (5) They received huge amounts of money from the puppet state. (6) They seemed to follow the orders of the Post-Heavenly Salvation Sect leader and the troops imitated the Qing Dynasty's organization, which involved suspicion of preserving the monarchy. (7) They planned a riot to burn and loot Bengbu, echoing the Japanese invaders. Fortunately, the crackdown occurred early, so the traitors' plans failed.</p>

<p>Amidst the Ceasefire Rumors in North China</p>
<h3 id="e114">News Received from Various Sources in This City <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Both China and Japan Believe a Ceasefire is Possible</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting Believes the Sino-Japanese Issue is International</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, after the newly appointed Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee, Huang Fu, arrived in Peiping, it was widely rumored in this city that China and Japan were moving towards a compromise. Although Huang has repeatedly stated that he will never sign any agreement, and the Japanese consulate in this city has also denied the rumored two compromise conditions, external speculation is still rife. With Rehe lost, whether the Japanese army will attack Peiping and Tianjin is of great concern to the entire nation. Yesterday, a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency learned that China and Japan had once discussed this matter in Shanghai, but it is difficult to predict whether it will be realized in the future. Judging from the remarks of former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, he also said that there is a possibility of a ceasefire, but the reality is still far away. When there is a possibility of negotiation in the future, the Japanese side indicated that it will send representatives from the military, and Minister Yoshizawa will not go north for the time being. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e115">Meeting with Yoshizawa Akira <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, it was rumored that the compromise on the Sino-Japanese military affairs in the north was discussed several times by Huang Fu and Japanese Minister Yoshizawa Akira, because there were rumors of two conditions: "The two sides understand that the Chinese army will temporarily station south of the Luan River, then the Japanese army will withdraw outside the Great Wall, and not encourage or supply the volunteers to disturb 'Manchukuo'." However, the spokesman of the Japanese Embassy, ​​when talking about it, denied that Huang and Yoshizawa had discussed this matter, and the compromise conditions rumored the day before yesterday were also said to have been spread by the Japanese Embassy.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Representative Issues <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday it was rumored that Japanese Minister Yoshizawa Akira would go north to serve as a representative when the time was right, but the spokesman of the embassy denied this yesterday. It is said that there has been no progress in this matter, and even if the time is right in the future, the Japanese minister will not go north to serve as a representative, because the nature of the solution is a military and local nature. It is also expected that the Chinese government will extremely avoid involving the Northeast issue, so this time the official diplomatic representative will only appoint a representative from the military, and if necessary, the embassy will send personnel to assist, just like the position of Japanese Minister Shigemitsu during the Shanghai ceasefire. As for the choice of military representative, there are still problems, because in terms of the Japanese military in North China, the commander of the Japanese army in North China, Nakamura, should be responsible, but in terms of war, the army that is fighting is the army of Commander Mutō, so Mutō should be responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Interview with the Japanese Minister <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Also, according to the interview with the Japanese consulate in this city yesterday, (1) Judging from the current situation, it is indeed possible for China and Japan to seek a buffer zone under mutual understanding. The purpose of the Japanese army is only to consolidate the security of the "Manchukuo" border. If the Chinese army can withdraw to the west line of the Luan River as Commander Mutō declared, and at the same time stop the activities of the volunteers, the Japanese army will definitely withdraw to the Great Wall and delineate a neutral zone, and no other conditions are required. (2) In the past two days, the war on the front line seems to have subsided slightly. In fact, the Japanese army does not need to occupy Peiping and Tianjin. Moreover, since Japan withdrew from the League of Nations, it has been diplomatically isolated. Occupying Peiping and Tianjin will inevitably cause international negotiations. This is not what Japan wants. Moreover, Japan's own economic strength and the current political situation do not allow the extension of the war against China. The reporter asked who is responsible for the negotiation matters between the Japanese Minister Yoshizawa in Shanghai and the Japanese Embassy in Peiping. He replied that Secretary Zhongshan is responsible. Military matters are the responsibility of Commander Nakamura of the Tianjin Garrison. If there are major matters, he will first consult with Commander Mutō by telegram, but there is no sign of diplomatic negotiations in Peiping now.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Wang Zhengting's Talk <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Former Foreign Minister Wang Zhengting, after arriving in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday, gave a speech to a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, saying that it is indeed possible for the military in North China to start a ceasefire similar to that in Shanghai, but the distance from reality is still far. Because the Sino-Japanese issue is now that war cannot be mentioned, and peace cannot be mentioned either. It has become an international issue of an international nature. Therefore, the fundamental issue must be the rapid unity within our country to seek a solution. In any case, the vast lost territory, such as the three northeastern provinces, must never be given up. Wang said that more than 30 years have passed since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, and we have a great tendency to forget and do not know how to work hard and strengthen ourselves, so we have today. Let's see how Japan's policy of aggression is. Wang continued to mention US President Roosevelt's declaration, saying that it was very fair and great, but we still need to strengthen ourselves and never say that the Japanese army can be withdrawn because of Roosevelt's empty words. The way to strengthen ourselves should focus on productivity. There must be production, and the government and the people must cooperate. Because the government's responsibility is to protect the people, and the people's responsibility is to support the government. Therefore, the people have production and must rely on the government's protection. Otherwise, the people have no production and the government has no power to protect, then how can the country not perish? Wang believes that the Northeast issue cannot be resolved in just a few years, but we must have the determination to persist, that is, the determination not to sign any evidence of ceding the Northeast land, just like the Paris Peace Conference. If we do not sign any evidence, there is still hope for the recovery of the Northeast. This point is extremely important, and the people of the whole country must have this spirit. When Wang was speaking, he cited the Shandong Qingdao issue and France's Alsace-Lorraine issue as examples. The Shandong Qingdao issue lasted for eight years from the European War to 1922 before it was resolved. The provinces of Alsace and Lorraine were occupied by Germany for thirty to fifty years and were finally recovered by the French. Therefore, as long as the Northeast issue is not signed with a certificate of cession, it can eventually be recovered. Finally, Wang talked about the issue of compromise, believing that it is impossible, because the two sides have no Common Bases (low degree of solution), so there is no way to talk about compromise. May I ask if Japan can agree to withdraw its troops to the South Manchuria Railway line? The people of the country should not be able to sleep soundly just because there is an atmosphere of relaxation. We must know that the Japanese can still invade at any time.</p>
<p>International Radio Station and Mackay Company</p>
<h3 id="e119">Broadcast Began Yesterday Morning <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Sound is Still Clear</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, the International Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications and the Mackay Wireless Telegraph Company have begun to broadcast. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency went to the International Telecommunications Bureau yesterday morning to inquire. According to the staff of the bureau, the wireless communication between our country and the United States has already been broadcasting. This time, the communication with Mackay Company can be said to be a new route for communication between China and the United States. At a time when the international community is paying attention to the events in the Far East, the addition of this line is also beneficial to our country. The two sides started broadcasting at 3:00 a.m. yesterday, and the received sounds are still clear. It is also heard that this broadcast still uses the station's original motors and does not add any new ones.</p>
<p>Two Civic Associations</p>
<h3 id="e120">Inspection of Enemy Goods Yesterday <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>According to Guo Wen News Agency, the investigation team of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union has been inspecting Henan Road for four days. All stores with inferior goods are willing to seal them up. In addition to filling out a voluntary letter for filing, yesterday there were still dozens of stores on the road that needed to continue working, so Fang Peicheng, Zhu Zhichun, Qiu Pingshan, Chen Shude, Ge Futian, etc. went to investigate. Among them, Zhonghua Bookstore and Minzhi Bookstore were found, especially a foreign goods store, etc., had products from printing companies. The association sealed them all up and issued a notice to pay attention to them, so that national goods stores would not be fooled.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Union has been actively checking enemy goods within its boundaries since it organized the National Goods Promotion Association. Yesterday, it issued another notice saying that since Japan implemented its dumping policy, the number of enemy goods imported is appalling. And some shameless good merchants, burying their heads in the sand, even disguised enemy goods as national goods to deceive the people of the country. How extreme is such a frenzied state of mind? This association is afraid that counterfeit goods cannot be identified, so it has sent letters to national goods promotion organizations in various places. If any suspicious places are found, please report them to this association so that it can conduct an investigation and ensure that enemy goods disappear and national goods sell well. The future of the country really depends on this.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Various Circles Report Enemy Goods <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Enemy Fish According to Yuan Dong News Agency, the Shanghai Fishery Inspection Committee for Enemy Goods recently received a secret report that two fish shops, Xie Xing and Tong Xing, were selling Dongkou dried fish, an enemy good. The committee immediately submitted it to the executive and supervisory committee for discussion, and decided that all the standing committee members would go to the two fish shops yesterday to seal them up. Xie Xing Store sealed up one large bunch and four large bags of Dongkou dried fish, and Tong Xing Store sealed up one large bunch and four large bags.</p>
<p>Enemy Paper The paper industry association sent a letter to the municipal chamber of commerce, which said: Dear Sir, the subordinate association recently received a secret letter from a gentleman, which briefly stated that China Fuxin Cigarette Company commissioned Fuhua Printing Company to print anti-Japanese posters (Pyramid cigarettes). The Iron Blood Group reported the matter, and your association (referring to our association) identified that they were indeed made of white cardboard printed with enemy goods. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce was requested to forward the letters separately to the Cigarette Factory Industry and the Color Printing Industry Trade Association to thoroughly investigate the case. After receiving the letter, the Color Printing Industry Association did not thoroughly investigate it. According to Fuhua Company's own confession that the Japanese goods paper and printing of this poster were all handled by itself, the association decided at a meeting at the beginning of April to report and announce the facts to the association (Color Printing Industry Association) and warn Fuhua for privately using enemy goods, etc. Unexpectedly, this resolution was put on hold. Later, due to the criticism from the outside world, it was inconvenient to put it on hold for a long time, so the previous resolution was changed, and only the printer (Fuhua) was ordered to publish an apology and pay a fine of 100 yuan. The punishment was inevitably too light, but once a bad example is set, the consequences will be endless. The following opinions are attached: (1) Fuhua Printing Company's purchase book clearly states that it received 22 reams of white cardboard from Fuxin Cigarette Company (Japanese goods anti-Japanese posters were printed with white cardboard), which shows that it was not handled by Fuhua. (2) It is absurd and ridiculous to privately use enemy goods for anti-Japanese posters, and it is a laughing stock to the world. (3) The fact of this case is that Fuxin Cigarette Company privately imported Japanese paper and entrusted Fuhua to print it. Now it is reversing the facts, avoiding the important and taking the light, and blaming Fuhua, so Fuxin Cigarette Company can still continue to import enemy goods. (4) It is heard from the staff of Fuhua Printing Company that this Japanese goods white cardboard was sold by four members of the paper industry association, but whether it is true or not remains to be thoroughly investigated. We have always admired your association's impartiality, so we specially wrote a secret report and requested you to quickly investigate and thoroughly investigate, etc. Upon receipt, according to this, since this case involves the subordinate association's colleagues, we have to conduct a thorough investigation. We will send the incoming letter to our industry inspection team for reply. According to the team's reply, they were commissioned to secretly investigate which company of the same industry sold the Japanese goods white cardboard of the anti-Japanese posters printed by Fuxin. A secret report letter was handed over to the team. After the team received the letter, they convened a meeting of cadres and staff on May 12 to discuss the secret letter. The following resolutions were made: (1) If it is as stated in the secret letter, the color printing industry association's handling of this case seems to have avoided the important and taken the light. In order to clarify the truth, it is proposed that you forward a letter to the municipal chamber of commerce, asking it to forward a letter to the color printing industry association, asking it to fully inform the handling of this case, so as to prevent external criticism. (2) It is proposed that you forward a letter to the municipal chamber of commerce, asking it to inquire with Fuxin Cigarette Company whether it issued materials (paper for printing posters) when printing anti-Japanese posters. If it issued materials, where did it buy this Japanese goods paper? (3) It is proposed that you forward a letter to the municipal chamber of commerce, asking it to inquire with Fuhua Printing Company where it bought the paper for printing anti-Japanese posters, or did Fuxin issue materials for printing? etc. The records are in the file. According to the previous reasons, we have recorded the case and replied. Please review and handle it, etc. According to this, the team's proposed method is still correct. For this reason, we have detailed the reasons and prepared a letter to be sent to you. Please review and reply, etc. This is addressed to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The following is omitted.</p>
<p>Enemy Clocks The Clock Industry Association once received a secret report that Hengxingxiang in the French Concession was selling enemy clocks and sent a letter of warning on May 8. At that time, because the matter concerned colleagues, it was not convenient to announce it. Unexpectedly, Hengxingxiang actually slandered all the colleagues in the city who were selling Japanese goods to a reporter of a certain newspaper, and falsely claimed that the De'an Clock Factory, which was solely founded by a Chinese named Gu Haizhen, was run by Japanese people. Its intention to sabotage is clear. After a certain newspaper published the news on May 16, it aroused the attention of the clock and watch industry in the city. (The old stock of Japanese goods had already been sealed by the association). The Nanjing Road Chamber of Commerce Joint Association also believes that Hengxingxiang's selling enemy clocks and falsely claiming that all clock and watch industry in the city are selling enemy goods has hindered the association's work of clearing out enemy goods. It suggested to the industry association that it should be strictly investigated. It is heard that De'an Clock Factory has entrusted lawyer Fang Jifan to negotiate, and the Clock Industry Association has also entrusted lawyer Liu Shifang to handle the matter according to law.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Reasons for the Failure of Chinese Tea <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Adhering to Old Methods and Not Thinking About Improvement</p>
<p>Mixing Fish Eyes with Pearls Leads to Loss of Credibility</p>
<p>According to Xin Xin News Agency, in order to develop international trade, the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry convened a meeting of tea merchant representatives to discuss all methods to restore the inherent status of Chinese tea in the international arena. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency interviewed Ji Zejin, the director of the guidance office of the bureau, yesterday. According to his talk, the reasons for the failure of Chinese tea in Australia in recent years and its remedial methods were explained in detail. The following is an excerpt: Ji said that tea is the largest category of Chinese goods shipped to Australia. In recent years, the tea market has also been occupied by Ceylon and Java. The reasons are nothing more than the following two: (1) Adhering to old methods and not thinking about improvement; (2) Dishonest behavior. According to 30 years ago, there was no other kind of tea in Australia. Later, because the customs found that the tea shipped from China was mixed with leaves and grass roots, and after adding flour paste and dry flushing into the water, there was no taste of tea at all. Only withered branches, rotten leaves and grass roots were seen. Australians greatly rejected Chinese tea, so tea from India and Java came in one fell swoop. To this day, Chinese tea has still failed to restore its credibility. This is the result of dishonest behavior. Secondly, Australians do not like plain tea (green tea such as Yū Qián Dragon Well and Maojian), but like black tea to take its golden color and strong aroma as the best product. Because Westerners drink tea, such as milk and white sugar, which is very different from the plain tea that Chinese people like. However, our country does not pay attention to it when transporting tea to Australia, and it does not know how to bake it with new methods, so it is very different from the preferences of Australians. Even if there is no mixing of grass roots, it may not be able to occupy the Australian market for a long time. Or there are those who change the method of baking tea to cater to the preferences of Australians, but after a long time, they use dishonest methods, such as baking tea with copper green, which is dangerous, or shipping Hui Long tea leaves to foreign countries and being discovered, which affects the reputation of tea merchants across the country. All of these are the reasons why Chinese tea is rejected in the Australian market. Furthermore, Australia imports about 3.5 million pounds of tea each year. To recover this interest, Chinese tea should pay attention to the following points: (1) Tea roasting must cater to the psychology and preferences of foreigners and use scientific methods. (2) Strictly prohibit tea merchants from dishonest behavior and unsanitary methods, mixing fragrant products, mixing fish eyes with pearls, and causing loss of overseas credibility. (3) The packaging must be firm and must not leak or lose its flavor. (4) Send more specialists to foreign countries for inspection to promote it. The above points require the cooperation of tea merchants across the country, and the promotion and guidance of the government, so the future of Chinese tea will not be difficult to restore its former glory.</p>

<p>Has Been Sent to the Capital for Handling</p>
<p>According to Guomin News Agency, Fang Qingjian, a supervisor of the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Industry Union, has been a member of the union for several terms. Recently, the central government suddenly received a secret report that Fang was the person in charge of the Communist Party in Shanghai, so it secretly ordered the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to arrest him. On Sunday, the detective team sent detectives to the Pharmaceutical Industry Union in Yaowang Temple in Xiaonanmen to arrest him. Fang Qingjian happened to be working at the union and was immediately taken to the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Then they went to his residence to search it. It is heard that there were many letters and documents from the Communist Party. Now that the Public Security Bureau has arrested Fang by order of the central government, it sent detectives last night to escort Fang on the Beijing-Shanghai night train to the capital for investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Japanese Cotton Mills in Shanghai <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Mocking the Lack of Patriotism Among Chinese</p>
<p>Resulting in Incomplete Boycott of Goods</p>
<p>Therefore, Japanese Factories Have Bright Prospects</p>
<p>The Osaka Mainichi Shimbun reported on the 91st of this month that in April of this year, Military Attaché Rear Admiral Izumitsu was ordered to visit China to comfort naval officers and soldiers. At that time, the Japanese Emperor was very concerned about the current situation and future of Japanese spinning mills in China. After Rear Admiral Izumitsu's investigation, he reported in detail, and the Emperor approved as follows: "The total investment of Japanese cotton mills in China is estimated to be over 200 million yuan. Most of this investment is from individuals, so their prosperity or decline has a significant impact on the domestic financial world. The rise and fall of the Shanghai cotton mill industry is a very significant issue, whether viewed from the perspective of investment or employees. However, since the anti-Japanese movement, the industry has been at a crossroads. Recent reports from Shanghai indicate 'sluggish sales, increased inventory, and reduced work hours,' leading operators into dire straits. But from a historical perspective, we should strive to avoid such an outcome. The Japanese cotton mills in China are the oldest Japanese overseas investments. Naigaiwata set up a spinning factory in Shanghai in the 44th year of the Meiji era. Thanks to the painstaking management of President Kawamura Rihei, it has achieved today's success. As for Mitsui's investment in the Chinese cotton mill business, it is a joint venture with the British and not a completely independent Japanese enterprise. Over the past 20 years, its development has been no less than that of Naigaiwata. Since the Shanghai Incident, the factory has been closed. Although it has recently implemented appropriate production restrictions, there has been no improvement. There are two major reasons for this: (1) The adverse general social conditions. Domestic spinning benefits from the decline in exchange rates and the impact of reduced work hours, while various parts of China are suffering from the scourge of soldiers and bandits, leading to local desolation and reduced purchasing power. Even Chinese-owned cotton mills are reducing work hours, indicating the growing panic in the economic world. (2) The impact of the anti-Japanese movement. Although it is not obvious on the surface, Chinese goods, despite their low prices, have no sales unless Japanese goods are specially discounted compared to Chinese goods. Currently, the only Shanghai factory that remains closed is the Nichi-Ka Spinning Factory in Wusong. Other factories have also been closed for four or five months. Recently, work hours have been reduced one after another. Fortunately, the dedicated planning of the operators has enabled them to barely maintain operations. The reduction in work hours varies from factory to factory, with Kanegafuchi reducing by about 30%, Nichi-Ka by about 23%, and other companies by about 20% to 30%. This reduction in work hours is primarily to avoid financial pressure. In terms of production, the change of manufacturing materials avoids competition with Chinese cotton mills. Since then, the processing of products has yielded significant benefits, leading all factories to hold optimistic views. However, in the midst of the intense anti-Japanese sentiment, it is necessary to acknowledge the good phenomenon of Japanese products achieving considerable sales. This is because the Chinese seek only cheap goods and are not afraid of anti-Japanese groups. If the Chinese truly thoroughly boycott Japanese products, last year's products would have been impossible to dispose of. It is the Chinese people's inability to discover true patriotism and their pursuit of self-interest that allows our cotton mill industry to proceed without hindrance. In short, since the incident last year, one aspect is that our (Japanese) operators have been able to skillfully maintain operations, which is indeed a stroke of luck in misfortune. Now, the difficult hurdle of adverse conditions has been broken, and there is no need to worry in the future. 1. Protection through tariffs: The current ex-factory tax is lower than import duties. 2. The 400 million Chinese people, no matter how poor, must wear clothes, and Japanese goods are cheaper than other goods. This is evident in the fact that sales increased even during the peak of anti-Japanese sentiment. 3. Remaining operators strive for economical production, which can both compete with Chinese spinning and increase profits. In terms of technology, Chinese spinning is definitely inferior to Japanese spinning, as is efficiency. The same goes for factory equipment. For example, the completeness of the Naigaiwata and Nichi-Ka factories is something that Chinese factories cannot match. The Pudong factory of Nichi-Ka Spinning has 53,000 spinning machines and 500 looms. Its power generation equipment costs only 1.5 sen per kilowatt-hour. The complete water purification system and skilled workers give it an advantage over Chinese spinning in every aspect. Production costs are also lower than those of domestic factories, so the cost of raw materials is very favorable. Due to the above three reasons, the future of Japanese spinning in China is optimistic. The Japanese cotton mills in Qingdao have not been affected by the Shanghai Incident at all. The Manchurian Cotton Mill in Dalian and the Manchurian Spinning Mill in Liaoyang, as well as the Naigaiwata factory in Jinzhou, have achieved unprecedented success in recent years. As for the Tai An Spinning Mill in Hankou, although it is temporarily closed, it will soon resume operations."</p>

<p>Mr. Jia Botao received a telegram yesterday from Guan Linzheng, commander of the 25th Division, from somewhere on the front line, reporting on the movements of his division. The original telegram reads: "Brother Jia Botao, The enemy we faced has shown signs of defeat since being severely attacked by our division. However, they still attack us from time to time, hoping to succeed. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers calmly fought back, and the enemy did not succeed. Subsequently, our division was ordered to protect friendly forces in occupying the position, and we were withdrawn for rest. Now that the task here has been completed, we will begin moving to our destination on [illegible] day. Once everything is organized, we will once again engage in a desperate struggle with the Japanese pirates. Your younger brother, Guan Linzheng, respectfully sends his greetings."</p>
<h3 id="e128">Labor-Management Disputes at Two Tobacco Factories Heard Yesterday <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>British-American Tobacco Factories: The British-American Tobacco Company shortened working hours in various departments due to sluggish business, leading to disputes. After mediation by the Social Affairs Bureau, four temporary measures were agreed upon. Factories One and Two resumed work the day before yesterday. Workers at Factory Three initially expressed their unwillingness to resume work because the arrested workers Zhang Yongsheng, Li Buxiang, Liang Weijin, and Ruan Buxi, had not been released. According to Wang Xianqing, chief of the mediation section of the Third Department of the Social Affairs Bureau, speaking to a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency yesterday, the workers at Factory Three were persuaded and resumed work today (yesterday). The authorities are said to be about to release the four arrested workers, so the strike at British-American Tobacco has temporarily come to an end.</p>
<p>Nanyang Tobacco Factory: A dispute arose at the Nanyang Tobacco Factory because workers' demands that management recognize the labor-management prerequisites were not met, and several workers were arrested. It has not yet been resolved. The labor union has drafted 24 articles, which have been approved by the authorities and submitted to the factory. However, the factory still refuses to accept them. Recently, it was heard that a small number of workers planned to distribute leaflets at the union headquarters, inciting everyone to withdraw from the Nanyang Office. The Fourth District Tobacco Workers' Union, fearing a major incident, requested that the Party and government authorities stop it. At 11:30 yesterday morning, representatives Wu Shiyuan and Zhang Zhang and two others petitioned the Social Affairs Bureau, requesting (1) that the workers be prevented from meeting and that the source of the leaflets be thoroughly investigated; (2) that the 15 dismissed workers be immediately summoned for mediation; and (3) that the newly drafted 24 articles be immediately implemented. They were received by Wang Xianqing, a staff member of the Third Department, who promised to convene both parties for mediation at 9:00 AM on the 22nd.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Madam Li Du Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Remarks by Representative Wang Ziyao</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, Madam Li Xie Yiqing, wife of Li Zhichu (Li Du), commander of the Northeast Border Defense Army and commander-in-chief of the Jilin Self-Defense Army, arrived in Shanghai at 5:54 PM yesterday, accompanied by Madam Jing Wang Dexian, wife of Jing Boan, the adjutant, and Wang Ziyao, the army's representative in Beijing and Shanghai. They travelled from Tianjin by train. They are temporarily staying at a hotel and plan to find a house to await Mr. Li's return to the country. A Guowen News Agency reporter interviewed Mr. Wang Ziyao at his residence yesterday. According to him, tickets purchased in Tianjin on the 13th were already for the 17th. When they departed on the 17th, tickets were already being sold for the 25th. The congestion was evident. The hotels in the Tianjin concessions were especially packed. There are still 30 family members of Li's subordinates in Beiping. They originally planned to come to Shanghai at the same time, but because there were so many people, it was even more difficult to buy tickets. The train station and travel agencies did not have group tickets. Therefore, it is not yet known when they will arrive in Shanghai or whether they will stop coming south. While they were in Beiping, they received excellent treatment from Mr. Qu Wenliu and Mr. Feng Yangshan of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeast Refugees. In addition to providing two months' worth of rice, Qu and Feng also arranged to purchase clothes and bedding for them. They are very grateful and plan to take the time to thank the association on behalf of all the family members. Among Commander Li's family members, there is also Miss Li Xiaofu, who is only five years old. She was separated from them in the chaos of the retreat last year. After sending people to investigate, it was found that she was being led by a female servant and is currently living temporarily in a certain institution in Hulin, Jilin. The situation in Beiping and Tianjin is very unstable. There have been five bomb cases in Tianjin. In Beiping, on the evening of the 14th, a plainclothes team organized by Chinese traitors attempted to sabotage the telephone bureau, telegraph bureau, and radio station. More than 400 people were arrested. Those with symbols and badges on their bodies and solid evidence are said to have been executed.</p>

<p>A Westerner Destroys His Home to Save Our Country's Difficulties, Truly Commendable</p>
<p>The aggression of our country by the violent Japanese not only infuriates our own people, but also causes many foreigners living in China to feel indignant and righteously rise up. The story of [Miner Searle] Bates is a prime example. Now, Mr. Ackfu, a German in this city, is willing to destroy his home to save our country, which is even more commendable. On the 18th of this month, a grand tour was held at Ackfu Garden on the Great Western Road for this purpose. Cai Yuanpei, Xu Jingren, Zhu Ziqiao, Kong Yongzhi, Ye Yuhu, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Yu Qiaqing, Du Yuesheng, Chu Huiseng, Lin Kanghou, Guo Le, Xu Xinliu, Chen Zeqing, Lin Wojiang, Ye Fuxiao, Gui Yanfang, Chen Songyuan, Wang Yansong, Wen Hongen, Li Ting'an, Xu Peihuang, Pang Jingzhou, Liu Yunfang, Guo [illegible], Wang Xiaoying, Zou Wenshi, Li Dachao, Qin Tongli, Gu Jinghan, Liu Tiqun, Wang Junxuan, Bao Ruanxing, Fang Haike, Gao Tongyuan, Tan Bozhi, etc., as well as members of the press Zhang Zhuping, Yan Duhe, Zhu Yingpeng, Yan E'sheng, Wang Yingbin, Yu Kongwo, Jiang Jianhou, Zhou Shoujuan, etc., archaeologists Wu Hufan, Liu Gonglu, Qin Xiangchen, Westerners Coke, German Consulate Dormer, Jin, and Schawelson, German Righto, and others, and Hu Diyi and Lu Yuting, representatives of General Sun Dianying, a total of more than 300 people, unanimously praised a certain Westerner's enthusiasm for China. Chairman Wang Xiaolai briefly stated that a certain Westerner was willing to use his property to help China expand its aviation strength, and would also donate aircraft and military supplies worth millions, which should be a model for the Chinese people. He dared to present this great and passionate intention and the measures we have formulated to all of you present. Then Li Dachao, chief of the Municipal Government Section, reported on the progress. Subsequently, Mr. Xu Jingren, Mr. Cai Yuanpei, Mr. Zhu Ziqiao, and Mr. Chu Huiseng delivered speeches, emphasizing the great significance of the Aviation Patriotic Award and stating that it was different from ordinary lotteries. They hoped that the Chinese people would work hard to promote it and enthusiastically sell it. Those who immediately signed up for the cause were extremely enthusiastic, and the steps for implementation have been decided. Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Yu Qiaqing, Zhang Gongquan, Lin Kanghou, Li Dachao, Bao Junjian, and others were elected as standing committee members, and the persons in charge of each group were appointed. The office will be established immediately to actively prepare for it. The cause and the measures are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Cause <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Since the Japanese pirates invaded and plundered our Eastern Provinces, creating a puppet regime, it has been more than a year. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, gaining an inch and seeking a foot, trapping our Jehol and forcing our Great Wall. Looking out at Yan and Ji, there are already military operations. They are fulfilling their wild ambitions like a wild boar or a long snake, disturbing our rivers and seas, and watching our interior, which is by no means unexpected. This is truly an unprecedented national crisis for China. All citizens should rise up quickly and catch up. Those with strength should wield their weapons and advance, and those with wealth should destroy their homes to relieve the country's difficulties, holding the determination to die and seeking a new path for rebirth. If everyone unites with one heart, the national crisis can be resolved. Now, a certain Westerner, who has lived in our country for more than 30 years, regards China as his second homeland. Seeing the brutality of the Japanese army, he was inspired with a righteous spirit and was willing to donate his properties worth 1.5 million yuan, as well as the proceeds from the sale of his treasured antiques, to purchase aircraft and various military supplies. After investigation by our colleagues, the matter is true, and we admire his enthusiasm and friendship infinitely. If a Westerner can do this, how can we not strive? Therefore, following the example of the Xin Family Garden in this city, we will use real estate and antiques as prizes. After public discussion, we will use real estate and antiques as a foundation to issue an Aviation Patriotic Award of 1.2 million yuan, divided into 120,000 tickets, each costing 10 yuan, with an additional 12,000 bonus tickets. After returning the original price and all expenses, the remaining proceeds will be allocated to the Aviation Patriotic Fund and used to support the front lines. This approach will not only benefit our country's salvation but also comfort the Westerner's grand intention. It is a win-win situation and can be carried out without hindrance. All our compatriots should promote it and widely sell it, and can also use it as an example to become the backbone of national resistance. We have jointly initiated this with leaders from all walks of life and have presented it to the government for joint planning. All our compatriots should enthusiastically compete to purchase it and not let Bu Shi and Xian Gao be the only ones to stand out in the past. We express our sincerity and cannot help but look forward to it.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Measures <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>(1) The Shanghai community initiated the Aviation Patriotic Award and specially presented it to the government for issuance. These measures were formulated. (2) This award is specifically for raising funds to assist the government in strengthening air defense and purchasing aircraft and military supplies. It is named the Aviation Patriotic Award. (3) This award is temporary in nature and does not conflict with or duplicate the Aviation Highway Bonds issued by the central government. (4) The total amount of this award is 1.2 million yuan, with each ticket costing 10 yuan, totaling 120,000 tickets. An additional 10% of bonus tickets, totaling 12,000 tickets, will be added, for a total of 132,000 tickets. For every ten tickets purchased, one bonus ticket will be given. (5) The prizes are a four-story Western-style building owned by a certain Westerner, covering an area of 8 mu, 4 fen, 7 li, and 1 hao, and 2 mu, 4 fen, and 1 li of land, as well as more than 500 pieces of antique art, with a total value of 1.5 million yuan. He is willing to estimate the lowest price, recovering half of the value, 750,000 yuan, and is even willing to donate 250,000 yuan from it to purchase aircraft and various military supplies to strengthen our country's air defense. Therefore, the Westerner actually receives only 500,000 yuan. (6) 300,000 yuan in cash will be allocated as the Aviation Patriotic Fund, and 100,000 yuan will be used as cash prizes. The allocation method is as follows: One special prize, a four-story Western-style building, covering an area of 8 mu, 4 fen, 7 li, and 1 hao, worth 450,000 yuan. One first prize, 2 mu, 4 fen, and 1 li of land, worth 50,000 yuan, antique art worth 30,000 yuan, and 20,000 yuan in cash, for a total of 60,000 yuan. One second prize, antique art worth 40,000 yuan, and 5,000 yuan in cash, for a total of 45,000 yuan. Two third prizes, antique art worth 17,500 yuan and 5,500 yuan in cash each, totaling 40,000 yuan. Two fourth prizes, antique art worth 9,000 yuan and 1,000 yuan in cash each, totaling 20,000 yuan. Two fifth prizes, antique art worth 5,500 yuan and 500 yuan in cash each, totaling 12,000 yuan. Four sixth prizes, antique art worth 1,600 yuan and 400 yuan in cash each, totaling 8,000 yuan. Eight seventh prizes, antique art worth 700 yuan and 300 yuan in cash each, totaling 8,000 yuan. Thirty eighth prizes, antique art worth 400 yuan and 200 yuan in cash each, totaling 18,000 yuan. Fifty ninth prizes, antique art worth 300 yuan and 150 yuan in cash each, totaling 22,500 yuan. Seventy-five tenth prizes, antique art worth 200 yuan and 100 yuan in cash each, totaling 22,500 yuan. One hundred and twenty eleventh prizes, antique art worth 100 yuan and 50 yuan in cash each, totaling 18,000 yuan. Five hundred and fifty twelfth prizes, 20 yuan in cash each, totaling 11,000 yuan. One thousand thirteenth prizes, 15 yuan in cash each, totaling 15,000 yuan. (7) The above prizes total 850,000 yuan, with 300,000 yuan allocated to the Aviation Patriotic Fund, and 5% for expenses, totaling 1.2 million yuan. If there is any surplus, it will all be sent to the Aviation Association. (8) The price of the real estate, antiques, purchased aircraft, and various military supplies donated by the Westerner for prizes should be assessed and decided by inviting Chinese and Western notaries. (9) The deed to this real estate, as well as the selected antiques and drawings and bills of lading for the purchased aircraft and various military supplies, should be deposited in a bank designated by both parties at the time of issuance of this award, to be responsible for safekeeping. (10) The issuance period will be three months after approval by the government, and may be extended with the approval of the government if necessary. (11) The date and location of the draw will be presented to the government for approval. (12) The issuing agency will follow the precedents of previous champagne lotteries and request banks, money houses, and companies in this port to act as sales agents. The funds collected will be temporarily held by the sales agencies until the time of the draw, to show prudence. The result of the lottery is estimated to contribute 250,000 yuan worth of aircraft and various military supplies to the front lines, plus 300,000 yuan in cash for the Aviation Patriotic Fund, totaling 550,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce Again Requests</p>
<h3 id="e133">Cancellation of Telephone Price Increase <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Cost of New Equipment Cannot Be Passed on to Users</p>
<p>Regarding the telephone price increase, the City Chamber of Commerce sent another letter to the Shanghai Telephone Bureau yesterday, requesting its cancellation. The original text is recorded below: "Respectfully, on the 18th of this month, we received a joint letter from the Soap Industry, Pickled Vegetable Industry, Wax Candle Industry, and Alkali Industry Trade Associations, stating that the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's plan to increase prices for installing automatic telephone machines has been opposed by various trade associations, which requested that the Chamber of Commerce forward their request to the competent authorities to waive the price increase. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has replied, mainly stating that (1) the increased price is to pay for the purchase of equipment, (2) although the price is increased, it is still cheaper than in the concessions, and (3) the cost of calls to the concessions has increased. However, although there are difficulties for the government, the interests of users must also be taken into account to ensure fairness. This is explained below: (1) The cost of equipment is a one-time start-up expense, while telephone fees are a permanent recurring expense. If the government passes on a one-time start-up expense to users as a permanent recurring expense, it is not only inconsistent in nature but also a heavy burden, reducing the number of users, which contradicts the original intention of facilitating communication. This should be addressed by raising funds in another way, and it should not be taken from telephone fees. (2) The market in the concessions is more prosperous than in the Chinese areas. The original market in the Chinese areas is already not as good as in the concessions, and the "January 28th Incident" of last year has further weakened it. Efforts should be made to reduce the burden on citizens to gradually develop the market. If the market can be as prosperous as the concessions, or even surpass them, the benefits will be far more than several million yuan. We should plan for the long term and not just seek immediate gains and solve the current urgent problems. (3) Since there are more calls to the concessions, the fees collected are also higher. Any matter of communication requires both parties, and there can be no one-way communication. Even if income does not cover expenses, the difference must be limited. The focus should be on facilitating communication, not solely on calculating expenses. Furthermore, if telephone fees are too high, citizens will not be able to afford them and will inevitably unite nearby stores and residents to install a telephone together to save money, or borrow other people's telephones. There is already a practice in the concessions of charging a few coppers for each borrowed telephone call, which is very popular. From the perspective of social and economic trends, if the price increases, joint installation and borrowing will naturally become more and more common. Users may not have the convenience of self-installation, but the government's revenue will also decrease as a result. This will defeat the purpose of facilitating communication and repaying the cost of equipment. The above-mentioned matters should be discussed and decided by your Chamber of Commerce, and then forwarded for continued fee collection to maintain commerce, etc." The letter from the Timber Industry Trade Association also stated that "the Nanshi telephone company charges an additional four yuan per month. In this season of economic recession, businesses are unable to afford it. The various trade associations have requested the cancellation of the price increase, and everyone shares the same sentiment." The reasons for this matter are hereby presented in a letter, requesting that the Chamber of Commerce ask the Telephone Bureau to continue to charge the original price, and we are grateful. Although the request for waiving the price increase has been rejected by the Ministry, our Chamber of Commerce is a commercial organization, and the difficulties of merchants cannot be ignored. Although the Bureau is under the jurisdiction of the Ministry and has its own position, it should also plan for its own business from a broader perspective and give its sincere advice to the Ministry of Communications. If telephone fees are too high, several households will install one telephone together to save money, which is an obvious fact. Moreover, logically, the Bureau's installation of new machines is the same as the Wheel Bureau's addition of new wheels and the Road Bureau's addition of new cars. One is to add assets, and the other is to attract customers and expand business. Part of the cost can easily be recovered from this, while the other part should be supplemented by adding capital and shares. This is true of all commercial businesses, and the existing users cannot be forced to share the costs equally. It is appropriate to send a letter to the Bureau, requesting that it adopt the opinions of the public and make gentle representations to the Ministry of Communications, taking into account the difficulties of merchants, which is to promote business."</p>
<h3 id="e134">Japanese Ships Smuggling Refined Salt into Shanghai <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Salt Authority Has Implemented Strict Enforcement</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, reliable sources have reported that recently, Japanese ships at the Yangshupu and Huangpu wharves have been smuggling refined salt into Shanghai from ports such as Dalian, Yingkou, Liaoning, and Qingdao. The salt is hidden in cargo at night and smuggled ashore. Because the smuggled refined salt is being smuggled by the Japanese, the police in charge have never interfered. Japanese soldiers patrol the wharves at night, and even if they see suspicious packages, they cannot go forward to inspect them. The amount smuggled each time is huge. Recently, the market has been flooded with refined salt, and it is often sold in small quantities of several packages, or mixed into table salt for sale, causing the salt tax department in the concessions to not sell even one catty. If this continues, the salt sales in the concessions will be completely taken over by this smuggled salt. If this continues, allowing it to be smuggled and sold privately, the national tax and commercial sales will inevitably be completely destroyed. Therefore, the salt authority has asked the concession and customs authorities to strictly assist in the enforcement and suppression to maintain the salt affairs.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Representative Letter from Sun Dianying Requesting Assistance <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received a letter from Mr. Hu Jiesan and Mr. Lu Hongkui, representatives of the 41st Army's Beijing Office, which stated: "To the esteemed Association, our army engaged in fierce battles immediately upon arriving at Chifeng to resist the Japanese. After the fall of Chengde, we were heavily besieged. We fought for ten days before escaping the perilous situation. However, sacrificing for the nation is a soldier's duty. We are deeply grateful for your Association's encouragement and generous donations. Your sincere dedication to the country inspires our soldiers. We will strengthen our resolve to resist the Japanese and fight to the end, disregarding the potential dangers. Our determination will endure until the end of days. Our army pledges this as our response to your esteemed Association. However, our army is stationed in the remote northern regions, where the weather is unpredictable. Furthermore, transportation is inconvenient and difficult. Soldiers are sleeping in the open and eating in the wind, sometimes even having to carry supplies ourselves. Therefore, the items most needed at the front lines are raincoats, tents, and heavy-duty vehicles. If your esteemed Association could provide assistance in obtaining these items, it would greatly alleviate the soldiers' suffering from rain and wind and significantly aid in the war effort against the Japanese. We respectfully submit this request for your consideration."</p>

<p>Aviation Donations are Increasingly Enthusiastic</p>
<p>The Ningbo Fellow-Townsmen Association in Shanghai Aviation National Salvation Fundraising Committee, since its establishment, has already been three months. The team leaders are persuading and collecting, which has been very hard work, and the results are only half of the target. It has been decided in the nine general meetings that all team leaders must make the final effort to enthusiastically solicit donations in order to reach the full amount. As a result, men and women have been coming to the association to make donations in an endless stream these days. The tenth drawing will be held at 5:00 PM this afternoon, and it is expected that the amount collected and reported at that time will be considerable.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Aviation Donation for Fresh Pork Sales Industry <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Public Association Temporary General Meeting</p>
<p>Collecting Two Cents per Head</p>
<p>Until Two Thousand Yuan is Reached</p>
<p>The Shanghai Fresh Pork Sales Trade Association convened an emergency discussion meeting of all fellow traders on the 14th and decided that aviation donations could not be deducted by other parties. After the decision, the general team leader's office of the Aviation Association's solicitation team convened the association and other related groups at 4:00 PM on the 17th to discuss the donation method, but no satisfactory solution was reached. Mr. Chen Zengguan, chairman of the association, considering the urgency of the foreign invasion and the peril of Tianjin and Beijing, and that all citizens should contribute their wealth to save the country, and that the performance of the 234th team of the solicitation team which he is in charge of is not good, had to seek other appropriate methods. He sent an emergency notice on the 19th to convene a temporary general meeting of all fellow traders in the morning. More than sixty fellow traders attended. Mayor Wu's representative Li Dachao, the Aviation Association office's representative Zhang Yuliang, the chairman Chen Zengguan, and the recorder Shi Yizheng performed the ceremony as usual. The chairman reported the recent situation in Tianjin and Beijing, which is very dangerous. Although the government is determined to resist for a long time, it lacks the weapons and the economy. Although the fellow traders of this association are in the poor class, they should also fulfill their corresponding obligations. If everyone is indifferent, the disaster of aggression will spread to the whole country. It must be known that after the country is destroyed, everyone's life and property will be lost together. If you want to protect the territory of the country, you must first seek the fulfillment of the air force, relying on the people's wealth to supplement the government's financial insufficiency. Now there are several questions for your decision: (1) Although most of the fellow traders in the solicitation team of this association have joined, the amount of donations is very small. Should we seek other methods? Resolved: Seek other methods. (2) The amount of donations and the collection procedures. Resolved: (A) Two thousand yuan. (B) All those who transport fresh pork in this city shall be charged two cents per head for aviation donations. (3) Collection location. Resolved: (A) Minsheng ship to Shanghai in Wusong. (B) Ship to Shanghai at Datong Dada Wharf. (4) Starting and stopping date of collection. Resolved: Starting from June 1st of this year, stop when two thousand yuan is collected. (5) Implementation method. Resolved: Send a letter to the Aviation Association Office to submit to the municipal government, please make a clear announcement, and inform the Seventh District General Office of the Public Security Bureau, the First District General Office, the One District One Branch, the Wusong Water Patrol Team, and Datong Dada Company to assist at any time. (6) The Northeast Refugee Donation collected on behalf of the banking sector. The Northeast Refugee Relief Association has already stated that it will end on April 26 this year and will no longer accept it. The banking sector has not stopped it. How should we negotiate? Resolved: (A) Inform the banking sector of the above in a letter. Stop collecting on the same day. (B) Correct the name of the previous donations. (C) If the banking sector needs to continue, it should be recognized by the banking sector itself. (D) Send a letter to the Aviation Association Office stating the reasons and submit it to the municipal government to order the pig industry association to stop collecting on the same day. (7) Upon receiving the notice from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, it is ready to join the Municipal Chamber of Commerce as a member. How should we handle it? Resolved: After all the membership procedures are completed, apply for joining in June. The meeting adjourned.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Inland River Shipping Labor and Management Request Both Sides to Ban Mechanized Sampans <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Preventing Dangers and Striving for Safety</p>
<p>Since the commencement of operations by the Bianli Shipping Company on various inland river routes, the illegal infringement on their business by mechanized sampans from Shaoxing has persisted for several years, resulting in significant losses. Recently, the Construction Department of the Provincial Government investigated and confirmed that these mechanized sampans violated the province's single-line shipping regulations. They instructed the Songjiang County Government to issue a public notice banning all such sampans operating within the legal steamship routes of legitimate merchants. The remaining sampans were required to register with the County Government and were restricted from further construction, providing a fundamental solution. The Songjiang County Government has already instructed the water and land public security agencies to strictly enforce this ban. Recently, the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Trade Association and the Shanghai Inland River Shipping Labor Union have repeatedly received reports from their members regarding the infringement by these mechanized sampans. Considering the seriousness and widespread impact, the Association and the Union jointly submitted a request to the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department to promptly order strict enforcement to ensure the safety of the shipping industry. This demonstrates that the issue of illegal mechanized sampan operations has aroused opposition from both labor and management in the inland river shipping industry. The original request is excerpted as follows: "We respectfully submit this request regarding the illegal operation of mechanized sampans from Shaoxing, which endanger passengers and disrupt the routes licensed to our members, as well as the livelihoods of the ship's crew. We jointly request a thorough investigation and strict enforcement, without any leniency, in accordance with the provincial shipping regulations, to protect the business of legitimate merchants and the livelihoods of the ship's crew. Our Association and Union have recently received letters from the Shenping (Shanghai to Pinghu) members and ship's crew stating that all ships operated by the members on the Shanghai to Pinghu route, in addition to registering with the Ministry of Communications, have also applied to the Construction Bureau of each county for verification and forwarded to the Construction Department for approval in accordance with the temporary regulations for inland river vessel operating licenses issued by the Jiangsu Provincial Construction Department. It has been observed that on the Shenping route, 70-80% consists of the vast Huangpu River, and 20-30% consists of small inland river ports. Recently, when the ship operators were operating the ships in the Huangpu River within the jurisdiction of Songjiang and Jinshan counties, they often encountered mechanized sampans from Shaoxing operating illegally. These sampans are of a crude construction, not complying with the principles of small steamships. The bow is lower than the stern, and the upper deck is heavier than the hull. Furthermore, they are operated by Shaoxing sampan boatmen who are not familiar with the navigation rules of steamships and lack safety equipment such as whistles. They often obstruct the passage of steamships and sometimes even collide with them. Although the ship operators exercise extreme caution, slowing down or even reversing to avoid collisions, the danger to the lives of the passengers on the mechanized sampans is imaginable. It is no wonder that there are occasional reports of capsizing and burning, resulting in injuries and deaths. If such incidents occur repeatedly, the ship operators will be unable to bear the responsibility that they should not bear. We request that the authorities be asked to ban them in accordance with the law. Furthermore, after the members sent personnel for detailed investigation, the matter is extremely serious. The sampan is simple and light. Even if our ships encounter them and slow down, they cannot resist the slight waves. Once a collision occurs in the Huangpu River, it is even more difficult to withstand. The sampan owners only care about making profits and disregard everything else. Small boats carry many passengers, and they drive recklessly in the Huangpu River. The danger is as reported by the ship operators. Furthermore, the mechanized sampan owners know that the hull does not comply with the principles of steamship construction, so they cannot apply for permits from the Ministry of Communications and the Construction Department. They dare to operate illegally without permits, cheaply infringing on the legitimate business of our members and the livelihoods of the ship's crew. This is extremely illegal. The matter concerns the vital interests of both labor and management. Therefore, we should jointly request the authorities to investigate and order strict enforcement throughout the province, in accordance with Article 7 of the temporary regulations for operating licenses, ordering them to stop operating, without any leniency, in accordance with the provincial shipping regulations, to protect the business of legitimate merchants and the livelihoods of the ship's crew, which is beneficial to both public welfare."</p>
<h3 id="e142">Chen Jizhang Accused of False Accusation Against Ye Liang <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Ye Liang, a native of Nanxiang, the resident director and director of general affairs of the Shanghai National Arts Museum, previously dismissed Chen Jizhang, a native of Zhejiang and a document clerk of the museum, on March 30 for taking away the files and registers in custody without authorization, which was against his duties. Because Chen's address was 507 Racecourse Road in the Public Concession, he reported to the Laozha Police Station on the next day for investigation. On April 6, the museum suddenly sent a letter to the police station stating that the case had been settled through mediation outside the museum and requested that it not be proceeded with. However, Chen suddenly filed a complaint with the board of directors of the National Arts Museum and the municipal government against Ye Liang for various illegal acts, totaling five items and 24 sub-items. The main ones include falsely reporting public funds, forging resolutions, and requesting the municipal government to issue bonuses, etc. Chen also reported to the Bureau of Public Works that Ye Liang also served as an employee of the Finance Department of the Bureau of Public Works, so he repeatedly took the paper and stationery of the Finance Department to the National Arts Museum office in Bo Bo Lane, Luban Road for abuse. In addition, he also filed a statement with the Laozha Police Station stating that Ye's previous accusation that he had taken the documents privately was not true, but a false accusation, and requested that he be investigated according to the law. Such a three-pronged approach shows his psychology towards Ye. However, after the Municipal Government and the Bureau of Public Works separately investigated the accused articles, they did not find any criminal evidence as accused. The Bureau of Public Works also temporarily suspended Ye's position in the Finance Department of the Bureau when it began the investigation. After the investigation, since there was no fraudulent behavior, he was still ordered to resume his position. Ye was unwilling to give up after this blow. He especially requested the police station to indict Chen as a warning to those who falsely accuse him with prejudice. The police station then filed a false accusation against Chen. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court summoned both parties to the court. Qian Hongye, the criminal judge, tried the case. The police station lawyer Ru Baozhen stated the situation and said that the defendant Chen Jizhang had committed the crime of Article 180 of the Criminal Law and should be interrogated. Ye Liang also stated the reason for dismissing the defendant and the beginning and end of the false accusations against him by various agencies. When asked about the defendant's confession, the defendant said that the documents I took were all those that should not have been issued, but Ye forced them to be issued. Now these documents are still in the hands of a certain three directors of the National Arts Museum and can be verified in detail. Judge Qian then instructed the defendant to pay 300 yuan bail and reschedule the hearing in seven days.</p>
<p>Tin Melting Injury Case</p>
<h3 id="e143">Two Apprentices Died of Severe Injuries <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Yiyuan Copper and Tin Shop, No. 51 Tongqing Street, Xiaobeimennei, Min'guo Road, because it received old tin, ordered its partners and apprentices to melt tin in the shop the night before. When the fire was raging, they poured gas on it, causing an explosion that injured six people. It has been found that the injured are Chen Shengfa, 19 years old, from Xiaoshan, Chen Xiangsun, 20 years old, from Shaoxing, who are apprentices, Ding Amao, 25 years old, from Shaoxing, Ding Aming, 25 years old, from Shaoxing, Ding Guozhen, Zhang Minli, etc., six people. Chen Shengfa was sent to Renji Hospital, Chen Xiangsun was sent to Shanghai Hospital, and the rest were sent to Baojiang Hospital. However, the shop owner Ding Zhao Hui returned to his hometown for something and was not in the shop, so no one took care of it for a while. The two, Chen Shengfa and Chen Xiangsun, died immediately after arriving at the hospital because their heads, faces, chests, and abdomens were burned, and all the skin on their bodies was peeled off. The injuries of Ding Amao, Ding Aming, etc. are also very dangerous, and they may also be in danger of life. Yesterday, each hospital reported to the responsible second district one station, and immediately ordered Jiang Pingyang, the head of the ninth shop, to report to the court. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Kong went to each hospital successively to confirm that he was burned to death and ordered to collect the body and wait for investigation.</p>

<p>丨Peacemakers Can Be Disheartened丨</p>
<p>Chen Shunjin from Ningbo, who lives in Ronghua Lane, Tangshan Road, has been working as a shop assistant in the Sanbei Shipping Company. Recently, he has often quarreled with his wife, Ms. Fu, and he does not give her daily expenses. His father-in-law, Fu Along, lives at No. 140 Puanfang, Zhoujiazui Road. The afternoon before yesterday, Chen and his wife had another quarrel. Chen asked Ms. Fu's father to come and mediate. Ms. Fu then went to Ningbo and came with her father. After arguing for a while, Fu Along's son Fu Jinfa and his friends Mao Yongxing, Gan Jinliang, and Wu Huifang also came to visit. Chen Shunjin saw that there were many people and feared that it would be unfavorable to him, so he took the initiative and ran into the kitchen to take a kitchen knife and cut Fu Jinfa and other four people in the head, face, arms, and other parts, falling to the ground and shouting for help. Huishan Police Station was informed and immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to come and arrest Chen Shunjin and take him to the police station. The injured were sent to Tongren Hospital for treatment. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Judge Xiao Xiefen tried the case. Police Station Lawyer Zhang Tianyin said that Wu Huifang, one of the victims, was seriously injured in the head and could not come to court. The rest were all present and requested that the hearing be postponed after questioning. He then presented the murder weapon for inspection. Then the woman, Chen Fu, explained the previous situation. The victims, Fu Jinfa, etc., all said that the defendant cut us indiscriminately with a kitchen knife at that time, but we were all there to persuade and had no other intentions.

<p>Ye Jiwu Carried a Thousand Red Pills</p>
<p>Wang Shunxing Tried to Extort Unsuccessfully</p>
<p>Ye Jiwu, a 22-year-old native of Nanjing, who has been a machine worker at No. 17 Fuqing Lane, Gaochang Temple, yesterday morning at about 6:00, Ye purchased one thousand red pills at a red pill agency at No. 33 Ruihe Lane, Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, put them in a cloth bag, and hid them on his body, and took the French Chamber of Commerce Route 5 tram, intending to take it home immediately. Unexpectedly, he was spotted by hooligans Wang Shunxing and others nearby and immediately followed him. They jumped on the tram, intending to extort money. When the tram arrived at Laoximenkou, Ye got off the tram and was about to transfer to the China Chamber of Commerce Route 4 tram to go to Gaochang Temple. Wang and others followed him off the tram and stopped him, loudly saying to Ye, "Friends, let it go nicely, quickly take out what you have hidden in your bag." Ye then asked, "What do you want?" Wang and others said, "Why are you pretending? Be clear, take it out." Ye knew that these people had bad intentions. However, because he was hiding drugs, he knew that it was difficult to deal with them. At that time, a Route 3 tram came, and Ye jumped on the tram to avoid them. Unexpectedly, Wang still chased him and jumped on the tram. When the tram arrived at Tanjiayingkou, Dadongmen, he grabbed Ye and shouted to the third post guard Wei Jinxiang, and took him to the responsible third station of the first district. When Director Jin interrogated him, Ye complained about the previous situation. When asked, Wang Shunxing confessed that he was 25 years old, a native of Zhenjiang, and lived at No. 176 Sanyuli, Taiping Bridge, French Concession. This morning, he came from the north of the city to the south to visit friends. He met Ye on the tram. At that time, he accidentally bumped into Ye's body, and a cloth bag of red pills fell out of Ye's body and was seen by him. However, Ye was still aggressive and scolded him for not bumping into him, which made him very angry, so he took him to the post police. Because Ye was carrying prohibited items privately, it was a violation of the prohibition, but Wang took the opportunity to extort money and made excuses to evade liability, which was also illegal. He was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the Municipal Public Security Bureau together with the red pills for investigation and punishment.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Autopsy of a Muslim's Tragic Death <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>丨Had Heart Disease and Died of Paralysis after Being Beaten丨</p>
<p>Yang Rongxiang, a Muslim from Zhenjiang, who lived at No. 112 Annakin Road, French Concession, at 3:30 PM the day before yesterday, his son Hua Guan (16 years old) had a quarrel with Ding Genxi from Yancheng, who lived with him and pulled a rickshaw, in front of the door. They fought each other. Yang, who was sleeping at home, ran out when he heard the sound and helped his son beat Ding, causing them to grab and twist each other. Unexpectedly, Yang fell to the ground and died. The police station sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Funeral Parlor for an autopsy. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police station reported to the Second Special District Court to appoint Prosecutor Deng Baozun and forensic doctor to come to the funeral parlor at 10:00 to examine the body. No fatal wounds were found on the surface of the body. The official then sat in court and questioned the deceased's wife, Yang Xu, the defendant Ding Genxi, the witness Xu Lihua, etc. about the circumstances of the fight. According to the deceased's wife, her husband was beaten to death by Ding Genxi's father, son, uncle, and nephews. The defendant confessed that the deceased's son spat cold water on his back first. He told him not to tie a bandage in the heat, but he ignored him and scolded him. He then hit him once, and his father, the deceased, came over and punched him in the right cheek before he could finish two sentences, so he fought back. The witness's confession was the same as the defendant's. The official checked the confession and ordered the forensic doctor to dissect the body again. After detailed examination, the result was that the deceased had heart disease before his death, and he died of paralysis due to insufficient heart strength after being beaten. The body was ordered to be collected by the deceased's brother Yang Rongzong after signing a guarantee. The defendant Ding Genxi was sent to the court by the police station for questioning. After the examination, the deceased's family sent the body to the Qingzhen Temple in accordance with the religious regulations, where the teacher chanted sutras, washed the body, and buried it. The defendant will be sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation today.</p>

<p>Special Request from the First District United Association</p>
<h3 id="e151">Guaranteeing the Housing Lease Rights of Citizens <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Submitted to the Municipal Party Department for Transfer to the Municipal Government for Approval</p>
<p>The First Special District Citizens' United Association of this city believes that the recently promulgated housing lease regulations by the Municipal Government could be exploited by landlords to infringe upon the lease rights of citizens. Therefore, they specially submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department yesterday, asking it to be forwarded to the Municipal Government for review and action. The original request stated: "Respectfully submitted, it has been observed that since the emergence of real estate speculation in the market, increasing rents and forced evictions have become prevalent. Lease rights are disregarded, causing hardship for citizens in both business and residence, and the social economy is declining daily. The customary practice of protecting tenants has not been valued by the courts, leading to declarations of provisional execution and rulings of provisional attachment, which have become weapons for those seeking to harm others. The situation in Shanghai is becoming increasingly precarious. The Municipal Government promulgated housing lease rules on April 21st of this year, which are most easily exploited by landlords, including (1) reclaiming for self-use, (2) property ownership changes, and (3) reconstruction approved by the Public Works Bureau. While reclaiming for self-use to terminate a lease is indeed a custom in Shanghai, it is limited to subletting surplus rooms. Even when approved by the court, a written guarantee must be provided that it will not be rented out again. This shows some protection of the tenant's rights. However, the current rules lack such restrictions, allowing even houses and city apartments specifically for rent to be reclaimed for self-use. The danger to tenants is evident. As for property ownership changes, they are easily fabricated by real estate speculators, given the lack of registration enforcement. Even if genuine, it fundamentally conflicts with Article 425 of the Civil Code, which states, 'Even if the lessor transfers ownership to a third party after delivering the leased property, the lease agreement continues to exist for the transferee.' This is because the rules stipulate that a fixed-term lease agreement, except for rent arrears of three months, only expires when reconstruction is approved by the Public Works Bureau. The Public Works Bureau's approval should have specific conditions, requiring the building to be at least twenty years old. Otherwise, the request for reconstruction cannot be rejected by the Public Works Bureau, even if it clearly knows that it harms public interests, due to the lack of legal basis. Therefore, it is necessary to stipulate in the rules that (1) reclaiming for self-use should be limited to renting out surplus rooms and not applicable to houses and city apartments specifically for rent, (2) Article 425 of the Civil Code should be strictly applied regarding property ownership changes, and (3) only buildings older than twenty years should be allowed to request reconstruction approval from the Public Works Bureau. Only with these stipulations can tenants have any degree of protection. The public should have a comprehensive understanding of the scope of implementation of these rules, and special districts should not be an exception. However, the provisions for the Public Security Bureau and the Public Works Bureau allow real estate speculators to circumvent the rules, which must also be noted. This matter concerns the protection of citizens' housing lease rights and the prosperity of the market. It is appropriate to submit this request for review and to urge the Municipal Government to take action, in accordance with the Party's principle of prioritizing the welfare of the people. This request is submitted to the Shanghai Special Municipal Party Department."</p>

<p>Local News from Hengli</p>
<h3 id="e153">Discovery of Blood Fluke Germs <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>Attention for Those Visiting Qingyang Port</p>
<p>Dr. Zhou Deng, Director of the Health Department of the Municipal Council, received a report from the Lister Institute of Preventive Medicine stating that cattle in the Hengli area have been found to be infected with blood fluke disease (Schistosomiasis). Dr. Zhou Deng believes that, given this discovery, anyone bathing in the waters of Qingyang Port is at risk. Applying a disinfecting cream to the body before bathing can reduce the risk, but it is difficult to completely avoid it. Furthermore, those traveling by boat and staying near Hengli should pay close attention to their water usage. Water used for cooking is relatively safe because the germs are eliminated at higher temperatures. However, washing dishes may involve using river water, which requires special vigilance. The preventive measures are as follows: (1) Store the water collected for two days before use. (2) Add one gram of sodium bisulfate to every quart (one-quarter gallon) of drinking water. (3) Add a ten-thousandth solution of creosol to the water used for washing. Dogs can also contract the disease and transmit it to humans.</p>

<p>| Autopsy of Miao Fengyi's Body |</p>
<p>A young man named Miao Fengyi checked into Room 107 of the Qinghe Hotel at 188 Zhejiang Road the day before yesterday and committed suicide by taking poison. The police from the Light Gate Precinct received a report, dispatched Detective Wang Jiaju to transport the body to the Forensic Examination Office on Fellen Road, and notified the court for an autopsy. These details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. It is now known that the deceased's original name was Miao Xingbao, from Jiangyin. He worked as a tea server at the Huadong Hotel on Shandong Road. His elderly mother and elder brother still reside in his hometown, where they are engaged in farming and live in poverty. His second elder brother, Guixiang, works at the Xinguanghua Light Bulb Factory on Bailebo Road in the French Concession. Miao, although over twenty years old, was still unmarried. Recently, a friend arranged a marriage for him, saying that a woman with a beautiful face could be married for a price of 200 yuan. Miao was very pleased to hear this and wrote a letter to his mother and brother, asking them to raise the money. However, he received a reply a few days ago stating that due to poor farming conditions, it was impossible to raise the money. Miao was very distressed by this news, and this was the reason for his suicide.

<p>▲ The Humanistic Monthly, Volume 4, Issue 4, Published</p>
<p>The Humanistic Monthly, published by the Humanistic Monthly Society on Lafayette Road, Shanghai, is highly respected by the academic community. It is reported that Volume 4, Issue 4 has been printed and released. The contents include Mr. Bai Jiao's "The History of the Student Movement and Student Unrest," which continues in this issue. Based on past facts, it comprehensively narrates the student movement and school unrest in concise language, especially the discussions on the May Fourth Movement, the May Thirtieth Movement, and the March 18th Movement, which are incomparable to superficial discussions. Anyone who wants to understand the causes and consequences of the student movement and school unrest over the past decade and its trends must read it. Mr. Jian Bing's translation of "The Innovation of Armaments" is by Liddell Hart, who experienced the European War, is knowledgeable in military science, and is now a famous military critic. This article describes the trend of modern new armaments. Reading it, one can understand the consumption of huge military expenditures in our country, while those responsible for armaments say that they are only enough to support a few days of combat, which is shameful, and that relying solely on crude and defeated military equipment and swords to kill enemies is insufficient to cope with the situation. Other articles include Mr. Wei Xian's "Miscellaneous Records of Zeng Yun, the Governor of Zhejiang," Yuan Tao Yu's "Records of Events in the Renyin Year," and Mr. Qian Banxiang's notes, which continue from the previous issue. "Reading Digest" and Mr. Hua Dingyi's introduction to "The Social Cultural Foundation" and Mr. Wang Zhaoshi's introduction to "British Political Organization" are all extremely valuable. The "Magazine Index" contains an exceptionally rich collection of materials. In addition to the Society's own sales, it is also available at Lifestyle, Crescent Moon, Modern, Juzi, Guanghua, Great East, Taidong, Author, Nanxin, Suxin, and major bookstores in other cities. It is reported that the annual subscription fee is three yuan domestic and four yuan eight jiao foreign, including postage.

Unfortunately, there has been no special book to provide detailed instructions, so that various libraries have not been able to fully utilize them. Now, Mr. Du Jiayou, a library expert, has edited the book "Library Forms and Supplies," which details the usage and styles of forms and supplies, totaling more than sixty types. It covers all library application forms and usages. It has been published and distributed by the Library Department of the Commercial Press on Niuzhuang Road, Shanghai. The China Library Service Society at No. 20 Museum Road also acts as an agent. Anyone who purchases a copy of the book will also receive a set of card samples.</p>

It was said that they would be handed over to Director Wang for worship and responsible preservation. After investigation, what is said above is completely untrue. I hereby make a responsible statement, respectfully hoping that your newspaper will grant a correction. Sincerely, The Beijing Office of the Palace Museum in Beijing, May 18th.</p>
<h3 id="e174">National Humiliation Week Lecture: Mr. Wang Yunwu Speaks on January 28th <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Speech given at the YMCA on May 13th</p>
<p>Since January 28th, I haven't gone anywhere to give a lecture. Today's lecture here is my first since January 28th. Why haven't I given a single lecture in such a long time? I feel that the decline in the physical development of the Chinese people is truly too severe. Other than a mouth, everything else is useless. The mouth can speak and sing high-sounding tunes, but the hands cannot do anything. Therefore, after January 28th, I have not participated in any lectures, except to make a resolution to do something.</p>
<p>Today, I came to the YMCA to speak because I really had a hard time refusing.</p>
<p>January 28th is not far from us in terms of time, and especially close in terms of space. So, if I tell you some facts, everyone knows them. If I tell you some theories, it will be close to singing high-sounding tunes. I will just talk about my feelings here.</p>
<p>Everyone knows very well that before January 28th, the people of Shanghai were all talking about resistance. But in the week before January 28th, because the disaster was imminent, many people wanted to seek temporary peace. On the night of January 28th, the municipal government finally surrendered to Japan. The Japanese consul expressed satisfaction. Many people simply thought that they could seek temporary peace, which is truly the most heartbreaking and shameful thing. I think it is not a disgrace for others to invade us with force. Our own lack of ambition is the greatest disgrace.</p>
<p>After the January 28th Incident broke out, everyone thought that the 19th Route Army could not resist, but the 19th Route Army was able to resist for more than a month! Also, everyone knows that the sacrifice of the Commercial Press after the outbreak of the January 28th Incident was very great. I think that the Commercial Press's sacrifice for the 19th Route Army, which was able to resist foreign insults, is still worthwhile, even though the loss was very great. The 19th Route Army's active resistance has great significance in national education. The sacrifice of the Commercial Press for this reason is even more effective than publishing 100,000 books to contribute to education and culture.</p>
<p>I often think that Chinese soldiers are the least afraid of death. Because the life of a Chinese person is very hard. Many people's houses are not much higher than graves. These people have no big difference between death and life, so Chinese soldiers are originally the least afraid of death when fighting. But because Chinese generals are too comfortable and too rich, they are reluctant to die. If you happen to encounter a few generals who don't want money and are not afraid of death, his subordinates will become an invincible elite force.</p>
<p>The purpose of the lectures held by the YMCA this week is to make people aware of national humiliation. In fact, we have so many national humiliations, how can we not know them? I think it is more useful to make people aware of their mistakes than to make them aware of shame.</p>
<p>I think our first big mistake is that what we say is too far from what we do. After the January 28th Incident occurred, all the shops in the city went on strike and only reopened after the ceasefire agreement was signed. They all posted a piece of paper at the door of the store, called "Opening for Business with Endured Pain." That's right! We are opening for business with endured pain! But what was the result? Some people changed "Opening for Business with Endured Pain" to "Opening for Business with Endured Happiness," which is very realistic. Most citizens are probably completely forgetting the pain they suffered before! Looking at all the improper pleasures in society after January 28th, how much has it decreased compared to before January 28th?</p>
<p>During the European War, the national lives of the participating countries were very hard. For the sake of long-term combat, not only were all unnecessary expenses eliminated as much as possible, but even two days of food were divided into three days for donation. At that time, Chinese students studying in Europe probably still remember the taste of the few slices of black bread they ate every day. Our country is now in a state of war, and our ability to defend ourselves is far inferior to that of the warring European countries at that time. However, the Chinese people, especially the citizens of Shanghai, have not reduced their enjoyment of peacetime at all. It's really inexplicable. Our country is in such danger. Even if we as citizens cannot actively do the work of saving the country, at least we must passively preserve a little vitality for the country. Unconscious consumption of materials is destroying the country's vitality. In addition, the physical strength of the people is also related to the country's vitality. After the European War, Germany's armaments were restricted by the Allied Powers, but the men, women, and children in their country paid special attention to physical training, preparing that once the country was at war with foreign countries, everyone could be a soldier. But what about us? We make all kinds of unconscious consumption in economic terms, and we only care about wasting our physical and mental strength. It is really heartbreaking and frightening to talk about.</p>
<p>The second mistake we need to know is that we have no direction. After September 18th, the people only knew how to sing high-sounding tunes, and the government only knew how to save face. A few days ago, the Big Evening News had an editorial saying that China now has not only no Yue Fei, but not even Qin Hui. The enemy is united as a nation and treats me according to a fixed direction. Our country wavers between peace and war. Not only is there no nationwide unified direction, but even a small group has divided opinions and conflicts before and after.</p>
<p>We have many mistakes, and these two can be considered the biggest. If we recall, since September 18th, our mistakes are countless.</p>
<p>We should recognize our mistakes and correct them thoroughly. The government and the people should not only care about face. We should determine the direction, unite against foreign countries, and then we can overcome the serious national crisis. Conversely, the darkness is increasing. Talking is also empty.

<p>Japanese Hawkers Selling Counterfeit Powder</p>

<p>Steel Tooth Shop Couple Were Deceived</p>
<p>Police Have Stated They Will Not Prosecute</p>
<p>丨Sheng Xiyuan, Wang Awu, etc. Are Suspicious丨</p>
<p>At the inlaid tooth shop established by Zhang Yingming, a Ningbo native, at No. 110 North Zhejiang Road, this month on the 11th, several Japanese people accompanied by two Chinese people came to Zhang's place to hawk inlaid tooth white powder. After Zhang took it to the French Concession for inspection and found that the powder was actually flour, they took a car back to the shop. Unexpectedly, the Japanese and others had disappeared without a trace, and it was discovered that the iron box in the shop had been pried open, and 420 yuan in banknotes and silver dollars stored in the box had also been robbed. The police were then notified, and detectives Tao Afu and a Western detective were dispatched to investigate. Five bags of white powder were found. Because of its resemblance to morphine, they feared that there was a case of privately selling morphine, so Zhang Yingming, his wife Zhang Zhou, and Li Yutang were all detained and sent to the First Special District Court for interrogation, awaiting verification of whether it was morphine before further investigation. Zhang Yingming and Zhang Zhou each paid a surety to be summoned at any time, and Li was still detained. Later, the police arrested the suspects, Wang Awu and Sheng Xiyuan, both natives of Shaoxing, and sent them to the court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning was the date for the continuation of the interrogation. Zhang Yingming hired lawyer Shen Xingxia to appear in court as his representative. Police lawyer Li Zhishan then stated the case, saying that during the adjournment period, the police had sent the white powder to the Bureau of Public Works' Sanitation Department for testing. The result was that it was identified as flour, not morphine. Therefore, they are now not prosecuting Zhang Yingming, Zhang Zhou, and Li Yutang. However, Wang Awu and Sheng Xiyuan are suspected of colluding with the Japanese Yoshimoto, Nakamura, Nishitani, etc. to rob Zhang Yingming of 420 yuan in silver dollars, and one of the Japanese has been arrested by the police and sent to the Japanese Consulate for investigation. There are still accomplices in this case who have not been apprehended, so they requested a further postponement. Judge Wu Tingqi ordered the Zhang couple and Li Yutang to step down as witnesses. Zhang Yingming testified that on that day, two Japanese people and Sheng Xiyuan and one person who was on the run came to sell five bags of inlaid tooth powder. I took them to the French Concession for inspection and found that they were actually flour. When I returned to the shop, the iron box had been pried open, and 300 yuan in silver and 120 yuan in banknotes had also been robbed. At that time, my wife Zhou saw it with her own eyes, etc. Zhang Zhou and apprentice Zeng Difu also came to the police station to testify, proving that on that day, they saw Sheng Xiyuan and a Japanese person coming to talk in the shop. Not long after, Sheng left first, and the Japanese immediately broke into the back, obtained an iron tool, broke the iron box, and robbed the silver dollars before escaping, etc. When questioned, Sheng Xiyuan confessed that he went with the Japanese Yoshimoto, Nakamura, and Nishitani, etc., but he was not present during the robbery. Afterwards, Yoshimoto distributed 56 yuan to him, and he temporarily stored 23 yuan with Wang Awu, etc. Judge Wu verified the confession and ordered Wang and Sheng to be detained, Li Yutang to pay a surety to be summoned at any time, and Zhang Yingming to remain on his original bail, awaiting a further interrogation on the 26th.</p>

<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>For tuning dials used on broadcasting or transmitting machines, even the slightest movement can prevent a stable oscillation. Therefore, the indicated points on the dial must be very accurate.</p>
<p>The indicator diagram discussed in this article is made using the principle of a vernier scale. Paste a black paper of considerable size on the back of the dial. Use white powder to draw ten grids on the black paper. The size of each grid is one-tenth smaller than the grids on the original dial. The total distance of ten grids is only equal to the position of nine grids on the original dial (as shown in Figure C). When using, pay attention to the small numbers when the upper and lower lines merge, which are the required decimal points. As shown in Figure A, it is 18.7 degrees, and Figure B is 38.8 degrees.</p>

<p>— Kai</p>
<p>AC radios have now replaced DC radios, but in terms of sound clarity, AC radios are ultimately inferior to DC radios, especially in single-tube radios. However, easy management and low cost are the advantages of AC radios. If we combine the advantages of both, we can make a semi-AC radio with very few changes in the DC aspect. Other parts are still powered by batteries, which can have the above-mentioned advantages.</p>
<p>Of the electricity used by DC radios, the A battery is the most expensive, and the B battery is more economical. Therefore, the A battery is first discarded. Now, we use a side-heated vacuum tube and use a doorbell transformer to light the filament, which can save costs. The B battery is still used to maintain the clarity of the sound quality. Doorbell transformers usually output around 10 watts. The secondary coil has different voltages, ranging from 3 volts to 8 volts or 4 volts to 12 volts, with a current of 1 ampere. To meet the needs of the vacuum tube used, the secondary coil can be removed and rewound according to the following method.</p>
<p>Suppose the vacuum tube used is 227, its filament voltage is 2.5 volts, and the current is 1.75 amperes. If the original secondary coil of the transformer has 285 turns and its maximum output voltage is 8 volts, then it should be rewound to 89 turns, as shown in the following formula: 丨</p>
<p>Once the number of turns is obtained, the transformer was originally 1 ampere, so it is advisable to wind two wires in parallel, which can obtain 2 amperes. The circuit can still use the ordinary regenerative force type as shown in the figure.</p>

<p>— Xu Runsen</p>
<p>Summer has arrived, the weather is humid and hot, and there are often thunderstorms. If high antennas are affected by lightning strikes, they will inevitably damage radio components. Therefore, attention should be paid to lightning arresters. The following devices can be installed at very low cost. It is worth trying. (1) This figure only requires a single knife switch. Connect it according to the diagram. During thunderstorms, close it downwards, and the atmospheric electricity will directly enter the ground.</p>
<p>(2) Use a double knife switch. Connect it according to the diagram. During thunderstorms, close it downwards. The antenna is completely grounded and isolated from the radio, which is the safest.</p>
<p>(3) Use a light switch and a plug. Install them according to the above diagram. When listening to the radio, just insert the plug into the plug. During thunderstorms, unplug the plug and close the switch above.</p>
<p>(4) You can use a burnt-out filament vacuum tube or an old light bulb. Solder the ground wire to the two legs of the vacuum tube GP, and then connect it to the radio to form a lightning arrester. The atmospheric electricity voltage is extremely high and can fly through the vacuum, directly connecting to the ground wire.</p>
<h3 id="e181">High-Voltage Vacuum Tube <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>At present, the filament voltage of wireless radio vacuum tubes is mostly from 1 volt to 6 volts, and the filament power is supplied by transformers. However, manufacturing transformers is one of the difficult problems, because if it is too large, it will take up too much space, and if it is too small, it will easily heat up and burn out. This often causes those who purchase wireless radios to pay an unexpected repair fee.</p>
<p>Several years ago, people in Europe thought about manufacturing high-voltage vacuum tubes that do not require transformers. Now it has been successful. Its detection, amplification, oscillation, rectification, and all effects are completely the same as the vacuum tubes currently in use. However, its filament voltage is 110 or 200 volts, which can be directly connected to household power, greatly simplifying the manufacturing of radios.</p>

<h3 id="e182">Double-Screen Rectifier Tube <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Its filament is somewhat like the filament in an electric light bulb, but it doesn't glow white-hot, so the heat is relatively low. Even if there are voltage fluctuations in the circuit, no noise will be generated, the sound will not be affected, and there will be no humming. Its lifespan is also greatly increased because, for those used with 110 volts, the filament temperature is only around 900 degrees Celsius, while ordinary 4-volt ones are around 1200 degrees, making them easily damaged.</p>
<p>The filament is inside a cylinder made of a rare earth material. The outside of the cylinder is coated with a layer of metal oxide. The control grid is a metal wire wound into a spiral shape, and the screen grid is not a sheet but a very fine metal mesh.</p>
<p>The rectifier tube has two or four pairs of rectifiers. Those made into a Wheatstone bridge circuit can output extremely smooth direct current, which can be used to supply vacuum tubes that require higher screen grid voltage. Specially made "high-voltage tubes" can be used. When using 110 volts, the output is above 310 volts. Another advantage of this type of vacuum tube is that it can also use direct current, so the radios made can be used no matter whether the power source is direct current or alternating current. It can be called one of the recent major inventions in the radio industry.</p>
<h3 id="e183">How to Check the Standard Time of the Observatory <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Yunzhen</p>
<p>Now that you have a radio, you certainly want to get the most accurate time. The Xujiahui Observatory broadcasts standard time via telegraph every day at one minute before 11:00 AM and 5:00 PM. Don't think that this telegraph is too fast to listen to, because even if you haven't learned Morse code, you can understand it.</p>
<p>The standard time telegraph broadcast starts every day at 10:55 AM and 4:55 PM.</p>
<p>From 55 minutes to 56 minutes and 50 seconds, send ::丨 once every two seconds. From 57 minutes and 0 seconds, send 丨:丨 once every two seconds. Until 57 minutes and 54 seconds, send ::::. The last dot is exactly 58 minutes and 0 seconds.</p>
<p>After that, you can hear five 丨·. The first 丨· that is heard is 58 minutes and 10 seconds, and the second 丨· is 20 seconds. And so on, until 58 minutes and 54 seconds, send …. The last dot is exactly 59 minutes and 0 seconds.</p>
<p>After that, there are five 丨丨·. When the first 丨丨· is sent, it is exactly 59 minutes and 10 seconds, and the second 丨丨· is 20 seconds. All the way to 59 minutes and 54 seconds, send …. The last dot is exactly 11:00 AM or 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>This telegraph has three wavelengths on a broadcast radio:</p>
<p>One is at 1450 K·C, slightly shorter than R·U·O·K.</p>
<p>One is around 970 K·C, next to the Zhejiang Province broadcasting wave.</p>
<p>One is around 550 K·C, even longer than the Tianjin broadcast wavelength.</p>

<p>(2) Method of Responding to Radio Telegrams</p>
<p>(1) Before communication between stations A and B, the transmitting station A should call the call sign of the receiving and transmitting station B three times, then send the 丨: (DE) signal and the call sign of its own station three times.</p>
<p>(2) Before mutual responses between stations A and B, the wavelengths of the two stations must be those monitored by each other.</p>
<p>(3) When the called station B hears it, it should immediately call the call sign of station A three times, then send the 丨… (DE) signal and the call sign of its own station three times. If station B is ready to receive the telegram, it can send the 丨·丨 (K) or 丨丨:丨 (GS) signal. If an explanation is needed, it should be stated briefly at that time.</p>
<p>(4) If the called station B cannot receive the message, it should send the ·丨… signal instead of the 丨·丨 signal in item 3, and add a number to indicate how long to wait. If it is necessary to wait for more than ten minutes, it should be explained briefly at that time.</p>
<p>(5) If station A needs to send multiple telegrams in succession due to having many reports, it should explain it briefly to station B and obtain its permission.</p>
<p>(6) When station B permits station A's request, it should add a number and the 丨·丨 signal to indicate the number of copies that can be received in succession.</p>
<p>(7) For telegrams with more than 100 characters, it should be limited to one copy, and multiple copies should not be sent in succession.</p>
<p>(8) For telegrams with many characters, they should be divided into paragraphs. Each paragraph should be 50 characters for clear text, and 20 characters for cipher and affixed words. After each paragraph is sent, a :丨: question mark should be added to ask if it has been received correctly. If it is correct, reply with the 丨·丨 signal, and then the sending station can continue to send the next paragraph.</p>
<p>(9) After the telegram has been sent, the ·丨·丨· signal should be sent, and the sending station call sign and the 丨·丨 signal should be added to notify the other party that the station has finished sending.</p>
<p>(10) If the receiving station receives the telegram correctly, it should immediately use the ·丨· (R) signal, followed by the telegram number, the sending station call sign, the 丨… (DE) signal, and its own station call sign to indicate that the telegram has been received correctly.</p>
<p>(11) If the receiving station continues to receive more than two telegrams and verifies that they are correct, it should use the ·丨· signal, followed by the number of telegrams, the numbers of the previous and subsequent copies, the sending station call sign, the 丨… signal, and its own station call sign to indicate that the reception is correct.</p>
<p>(12) If the work of both stations A and B is completed, each station should send the …丨·丨 signal and its own station call sign to declare that their work is completed. (To be continued)</p>

<p>▲ Radio Receivers During the Plum Rain Season. The most vulnerable time for radio receivers is during the plum rain season. Recently, there have been consecutive days of thunderstorms, and the weather has entered the moldy season. Upon inspection of the radio, the circuits are intricate and there are many parts. Once invaded by moisture, they will either mold and rot or fall off. The most important parts are the loop antenna and the frame antenna, which can become moldy, or the resistors and capacitors can corrode. As a result, the radio may make strange noises, or it may be completely silent, and various other inaudible phenomena may occur. Furthermore, being struck by lightning can make the radio sound inferior. The radio repair department of the Yada Company, located at 25 Renji Road in this city, has received a large number of requests for radio repairs due to consecutive days of thunderstorms. They are now hiring more specialists to engage in repairs, ensuring prompt delivery. The company's low prices and excellent repairs are particularly praised by all sectors of society.</p>

<p>Preliminary Election to be Held on the 27th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Track and Field Team Committee held a meeting at the YMCA at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday (the 18th). Rong Qizhao, Shen Guoquan, Wang Fudan, Jiang Xiangqing, Peng Sanmei, Shen Kunnan, and Sun Duoqi attended. Shen Guoquan was elected as chairman. They discussed the preparation for the Chinese team and the selection method. The meeting lasted for two hours before adjourning. The resolutions are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The method of producing representatives of the Chinese team was decided to be based on the results of various sports meets in Shanghai this season, selecting the better and more reliable ones. Those who have been selected will be used first. In addition, due to the lack of performance basis, it is inevitable that some talents will be missed. Therefore, a preliminary election meeting will be held on the afternoon of May 27th (Saturday). Those who reside in Shanghai, are amateur track and field athletes, and are not listed in the table below, and wish to take the test, can register with the YMCA from now on.</p>

Continued discussion of the event: (1) The number of students recommended by each province has exceeded the original quota (300) by a large amount. How to handle the case was discussed by the public. It was believed that it was limited to classrooms and could not accommodate more, so it was resolved to expand to 400 students (an increase of 100 from the original); (2) Teacher appointment letters were resolved to be sent out next week; (3) Student admission notices were resolved to be sent out to remote provinces first; (4) The next meeting date was scheduled to be held at 5:00 PM next Wednesday.</p>

<p>The Bureau of Public Works Girls' Middle School on Medhurst Road in this city, founded by Principal Yang Nielingyu, held a spring frolic at Cheng Yize's private residence playground at 3 PM yesterday, the 19th, to promote physical education and encourage academic pursuits. First was the School Flower celebration ceremony, with high school freshman Cheng Ziwen as the School Flower, chosen as the student with the best physical education, academics, and character in the school. The school's student orchestra played music, making the ceremony quite grand. After the ceremony, physical education director Chen Yongsheng led all the students into the field. A film company filmed the event. After singing a welcome song, there were group exercises, character formation exercises, races, shuttlecock kicking, boxing, umbrella dances, human pyramids, and Scout drills. Despite the rainy and wet conditions, Ms. Chen and all the students were full of energy and marched in orderly fashion, reversing the "delicate and frail" stereotype. Over 800 guests praised them endlessly.</p>
<p>First Day of the Inter-School Athletic Meet</p>
<h3 id="e205">Excellent Performances in 100m and 200m <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>▲200m Preliminary Round Sets New Record of 23.6 Seconds</p>
<p>▲Yesterday, Shanghai Middle School Dominated Field Events, Guanghua Excelled in Track Events</p>
<p>▲Finals to Continue This Afternoon from 1 PM</p>
<p>The Shanghai Inter-School Athletic Federation's 4th Track and Field Meet was held at the China Athletic Field starting at 1:30 PM yesterday. The weather was unfavorable, and the spectators were sparse. It started with drizzle and then turned into heavy rain, greatly diminishing the atmosphere of the meet. The athletes and staff were soaked. The performances were quite outstanding, especially in the 100m and 200m, where there was an abundance of talent and fierce competition. In the 200m preliminary round, Jiang Jiaxian and Dong Chu both set a new meet record of 23.6 seconds, which was not easy. In yesterday's finals, Shanghai Middle School dominated the field events with 10 points, while Guanghua excelled in track events with 7 points. In the women's division, the situation was even between Guanghua, Shanghai Middle School, and Jinan University. Currently, Guanghua leads with 17 points. Details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Miscellaneous Notes on Various Competitions <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>▲Outstanding Sprint Performances: Liu Jiaxian (Minli), Dong Yinchu (Guanghua), and Huang Feilong (Jinan) are outstanding talents in sprinting. In the 100m preliminary round, they all won with 11.8 seconds. Li Songnian of Daxia is also strong. The finals today will surely be a fierce battle, and the outcome is hard to predict. In the 200m preliminary round, Liu Jiaxian and Dong Yinchu both set a new record of 23.6 seconds. Huang Feilong was knocked down by Liu. It's also hard to predict who will win in today's finals.</p>

<p>▲Tense Long Jump Competition: The strength of each competitor in the long jump was quite even. Wang Jusheng of Shanghai Middle School won the championship with 5.59 meters. Lin Shihua was second with 5.55 meters, Gong Hong third with 5.54 meters, and Hu Bao fourth with 5.53 meters. The differences were minimal.</p>
<p>▲Satisfactory Discus Performance: Liu Jiayu's victory in the discus was not unexpected. However, due to the rain and slippery ground, and the discus being contaminated with cement, it was difficult to exert force. The result of 30.39 meters was still somewhat lacking. The results of the second, third, and fourth places were quite far apart.</p>

<p>丨Mass Meeting at the China Baseball Field丨</p>
<p>(1) Times vs. People's Voice...3:15 PM</p>
<p>(2) Morning News vs. News...4:15 PM</p>
<p>(3) Shen Bao vs. Current Affairs...5:15 PM</p>
<p>Since the opening of the Shanghai six major newspaper editorial department inter-departmental football league, three matches have been played, with full spirit and strong interest. The battle between Current Affairs News and People's Voice the other day, fought in mud and water up to the ankles, was especially grand. Today is the third day of the single round-robin schedule. The soldiers and generals of the six newspapers are all out in force, and the battle will surely be even more exciting than before. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>▲Today's Schedule</p>
<p>Competing Teams Start Time Location Referee</p>
<p>(1) Times vs. People's Voice 3:15 PM Baseball Field Shen Huichun</p>
<p>(2) Morning News vs. News 4:15 PM Baseball Field Shen Huichun</p>
<p>(3) Shen Bao vs. Current Affairs 5:15 PM Baseball Field Zhang Yi</p>
<p>The matches will start on time. It is hoped that the team members of each newspaper will arrive at the field in uniform in advance and await orders. It is also hoped that each team will appoint one linesman.</p>
<p>▲Rain or Shine</p>
<p>There were thunderstorms in the past two days, and the ball field was flooded with several inches of water, which goes without saying. Observing the weather, there is still little hope of clearing up today, but in order to express determination and courage, regardless of the situation, it is necessary to kick it out clearly. The words "weak scholar" have always been linked together, which feels uncomfortable, and even has an insulting meaning. Scholars are not necessarily weak, and the weak are not necessarily scholars. No matter if it thunders or rains, today we will definitely not believe in three things and not take four basins, and we must make it clear. As for borrowing the baseball field, we have already made an agreement with Mr. Zhou Jiaqi, so there is no problem.</p>
<p>▲Visitor Information</p>
<p>Today's competition will naturally attract many colleagues and workers from various newspapers to cheer, and even more wives and children will come to comfort and support. In order to maintain order, please take a seat on the grandstand. Non-newspaper fans are also requested to do the same. In short, except for substitutes, no one is allowed to cross the wire fence.</p>
<p>▲Warning to the Cabinet</p>
<p>During the previous two games, the reporter discovered two amusing anecdotes: (1) The cabinet premier of a certain reporter put on a stern face and said to his black lacquer bench, "You already have a group of children, don't follow them and make a fuss. These things are done by young lads." (2) A Suzhou nanny said to his young master, "Young master, the madam told me to tell you not to play football, and to go see a movie together." These were all witnessed by the reporter at the City First Sports Field, and it seems that reporters are only allowed to do "indoor work" and not "outdoor work," which is a great mistake. Considering that this is the first time, we will allow them to make amends for their crimes. Today is the day for self-renewal. If such incidents occur again, the football committee of each newspaper will impeach them and will not tolerate them.</p>

<h3 id="e214">General Overview of Education in Various European Countries (3) <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Recorded by Lu Bingqian</p>
<p>IV. China's Educational Problems (1) "Teacher Training": Germany has very strict qualifications for teachers, requiring a university degree. Previously, graduates of normal schools had to attend university for further study to improve their level, making it difficult to become a teacher. University graduates first work as assistant teachers for three or four years, and even fifteen years, before they can take on a position. China is not like that. University students are unwilling to become primary school teachers, let alone assistant teachers. There is a deep sense of hierarchy. In foreign countries, as long as it is their interest, education is their lifelong career. I used to advocate that primary and secondary school teachers should have the same training, and there should be no distinction in training. At the time, I thought it was a dream, but now Germany is implementing it, and I know that it is not just an ideal. Secondly, teacher experience is also very important. England does not pay much attention to teachers' knowledge, but focuses on practical training. A normal school student usually has practical experience before graduating. In Russia, the number of schools has developed very rapidly in recent years. The number of illiterate people used to be around 85%, but now it is only 11% or 12%. Almost all the people in the country can read, except for some parts of Siberia. Because of the development of schools, there is a shortage of teachers. They first set up schools, and when there are not enough teachers, they appoint those who can read and teach, and then train them while they are teaching, such as organizing research groups, so that everyone has the opportunity to continue their studies during their service. China's current situation requires an emergency solution, and Russia is a good example. Just now, Director Pan said that only 30% of the children in Shanghai are enrolled in schools, while 60% are not. The same is true in Nanjing. There are so few schools, and children naturally do not have many opportunities to go to school. This phenomenon is very dangerous. It is naturally difficult to ask for progress in Chinese education. I think we can set up more schools now, and it is not too late to seek progress when the number of schools has reached a considerable level. (2) "Child Care": European countries pay much attention to child care, probably because after the war, there were too many deaths and the fertility rate decreased. At the same time, children's bodies also degenerated, so they had to pay attention to this point. Vienna, Austria, is even more thorough in its child care. It pays attention before a child is even born. They divide the city into several districts, and each district has several nurses who are responsible for investigating each family or trying to change their environment. When a woman is about to give birth, they notify the factory to approve leave for her.</p>

<h3 id="e215">The Realization of "Short Action Tales" <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>Storytellers refer to stories about "battling rogues," "stealing the alliance book," or "breaking the Copper Net Formation"—the kind of martial arts novels called "short action tales." The meaning of "short action" is different from the elaborate armor and flowing robes of the "Romance of the Three Kingdoms" or "The Story of Yue Fei." These tales are best suited to the working-class, farmer-laborer society. The further one gets from the city, the better the business for short action tales. When someone speaks of a punch or a kick, scaling walls using skill, or the plum blossom stance showing its ability, it's guaranteed that the short-action-clad listeners will have their eyebrows twitching, their faces tensing and relaxing, making all sorts of comical expressions.</p>
<p>Since Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu has issued a document seeking talent, inviting extraordinary individuals from all directions who know how to scale walls, capture, and apply pressure points. I imagine that "under a heavy reward, there must be brave men," and perhaps there are already many strange and bizarre figures on the roads of Shandong coming to be Justice Han's Huang Tianba. However, without a staged battle, without demonstrating their amazing abilities in front of the masses, is there a possibility that the characters in short action tales could actually come to life? That remains a question.</p>
<p>Although Shandong has not set up a fighting stage, one is about to appear in Hong Kong. The former director of the Guangdong-Guangxi National Arts Hall, Cai Yigong, is a renowned disciple of Wang Yinlin. He knows how to wield swords and weapons, and also how to separate hands from body, not to mention techniques like pressure point strikes. Merchants and gentry in Hong Kong admire his martial arts prowess and want to invite him to Hong Kong to promote national martial arts at this time of national crisis. Furthermore, they plan to build an ancient plum blossom pole fighting stage in Shatin, New Territories, to welcome participants from all walks of life. The plum blossom poles will be made purely of large cedar trees, standing twelve feet high. First, 547 large cedar poles will be planted in the ground, each one foot apart, arranged in a plum blossom pattern, with five poles forming a flower, for a total of 108 flowers on the stage. Under the stage, weapons such as knives, spears, swords, and halberds will be displayed. There will be no wooden ladder; one must rely purely on skill to ascend and descend. Without superior national martial arts, one cannot ascend this ancient plum blossom pole fighting stage. Upon seeing this record, all sorts of "Golden Platform Tales" and "Seven Heroes and Five Gallants" short action tales seem to have a greater possibility of becoming reality.</p>
<p>Promoting national martial arts is not to be criticized, but when enemy planes and cannons can do as they please, merely promoting national martial arts may be too slow to be of any use! While promoting the martial arts of the old era, one must also invent the lethal weapons of the new era. If the Big Sword Corps were all-powerful on the battlefield, would the enemy be able to run rampant to this extent? In my opinion, the lethal weapons of the new era are even more necessary and applicable than the martial arts of the old era.</p>
<h3 id="e216">A Shared Biography of "Ah San" and "Ah Si" <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Since Ah Dai and Ah Er went out to sing lotus flower ballads together and never returned, only Ah San and Ah Si remained. Speaking of Ah San's qualifications, he can truly be considered an old Shanghai hand. More than sixty years ago, when Shanghai was still a desolate land, Ah San followed the Westerners to Shanghai to do the work of clearing the wilderness. At that time, Shanghai was certainly not as prosperous and convenient as it is today. After working hard, the Westerners wanted to find a chair to sit on and rest, but they couldn't, so they always shouted "I Say" at the top of their lungs. Ah San would inexplicably run up to them, and they would pat him on the back, meaning they wanted him to face the ground and squat down, and thus a "man-made chair" was successfully created. It is said that Westerners spent most of their time reading newspapers and smoking on this man-made chair.</p>
<p>Since Ah San had made such a contribution, and because he had no home to return to, the Westerners treated him specially. At that time, Ah Si was truly ignorant, daring to make trouble for the Westerners and spout wild talk about killing Westerners. So the Westerners used Ah San to discipline Ah Si. To this day, Ah San still stands at the crossroads with an armed belt, slapping Ah Si in the face a few times to relieve boredom when he is happy, which is really impressive!</p>
<p>It is said that the troubled Ah Si is an unsuccessful descendant of a once-prominent family. His ancestors were hereditary land brokers who specialized in doing business with foreigners. The land they "sold out" in their hands amounted to no less than tens of millions of square miles. However, the Westerners did not particularly favor this dedicated "tiger slayer." On the contrary, they said that he had a cheap bone and no sense of national identity, and was not as favored as Ah San, so his family's situation gradually declined. Until Ah Si's generation, it might be the last generation, the Westerners were so cunning that they could use force to seize land, and they did not need brokers to solicit business, so Ah Si's hereditary title was declared abolished. After this blow, Ah Si became depressed and increasingly gluttonous and lazy, and became wilted. The Westerners originally said that he was a sick man, and their encroachment became even more severe, so he became even more afraid, running away at the sight of the Westerners' shadows. It is a pity that he originally suffered from twenty-three years of pulmonary tuberculosis, and now he is suffering from poverty and disease, both internally and externally, and he is so haggard that he is simply unrecognizable. However, his nature is very proud. He saw that Zhuge was called "Crouching Dragon," so he compared himself to a "Sleeping Lion." Of course, when the lion is sleeping, any animal can bully him, but once he wakes up, no one can be his opponent. Ah Si's ambition is evident here. However, Ah Si himself is probably not sure when this sleeping lion will wake up, so Ah Si is still an Ah Si, until he is eliminated!</p>
<h3 id="e217">Two Interesting Anecdotes of Wang Tieshan <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Wang Hu (Tieshan) was indeed a worthy and honest official of his generation. The people of the country unanimously mourned his death. I heard anecdotes about him from friends at gatherings, and I have selected two of the most interesting to record, perhaps for excellent conversation after tea and wine.</p>
<p>Hu maintained personal frugality. Even after becoming the Governor of Jiangsu Province, he still maintained the original character of a poor scholar, wearing simple cloth clothes without any luxury. He often went out without attendants, walking on foot. Only when his feet were sore and tired did he hire a rickshaw as a substitute. Sometimes, when the rickshaw puller asked for too high a price, he often hesitated to spend a few copper coins and would stagger home. He also adhered to a policy of cost-cutting regarding household expenses, saving to the point where it was impossible to save any further. His wife still personally drew water from the well and raised ducks and chickens, not shirking from hardship. One day, he suddenly returned home and saw his wife feeding white rice to the chicks. He was very unhappy and rebuked his wife, saying, "Why are you feeding the chickens white rice instead of bran?" His wife disagreed, and a quarrel erupted immediately. He carried his remaining anger and went outside to buy bran, but unexpectedly, he could only find white rice and no bran at all. Only then did he realize that he had been rigid and wrong to blame his wife. He quickly apologized to his wife, and she forgave him with a smile.</p>
<p>He did not prepare many dishes for his meals, saying, "Since it is eating, rice should be the main focus, and dishes should be secondary. Wealthy families often have a variety of dishes and delicacies served at every meal, which deviates from the original intention of eating." His favorite dish was steamed crucian carp, with ham, winter mushrooms, scallions, ginger, and lard on top, which he regarded as an unparalleled delicacy. During festivals, he would definitely eat this to comfort himself. Someone advised him that if he liked crucian carp so much, why not cook it often? He replied, "The delicacies of the world should be savored and enjoyed gradually. If you devour them all at once, that is what crude people do. Moreover, killing a life every day for the sake of satisfying one's appetite is not permitted by Confucianism." A certain subordinate knew that he had a fondness for crucian carp and specially bought several large crucian carp to curry favor with him, keeping them in a magnetic pot, where they were still actively swimming. Unexpectedly, when he saw them, he not only did not express welcome but refused to accept them. The subordinate insisted, and he said, "I appreciate your kindness, but it would be impolite to refuse. In that case, I will hang a few of the fish you gave me in the hall so that the guests will know that you gave them." The subordinate was greatly ashamed and hurriedly took the fish and fled.</p>

<p>But he said that he was determined not to talk to you, saying it would be useless because you wouldn't listen to him anyway, so why waste his breath? Because of this, I said to him, let me relay these words to you, so that the two brothers don't lose their harmony over these words. Ji Zhi was speechless after hearing these words and kept his head down in silence. Later, Mrs. Gan said, "You don't have to make things difficult. Once these words are said, they're done. As long as you're willing to break off contact with Miss Lao, your brother won't blame you for the past. Besides, he already asked us to refuse her visits more than a month ago. If you hadn't made an appointment with her at the milk tea shop yesterday, you wouldn't have had any contact. Frankly, isn't this all trouble you brought on yourself? I'm not good at speaking, so I only have these few words. Listen if you want, don't listen if you don't want, this is all I have to say, think about it yourself." With that, she threw away the short cigarette butt in her hand, lit another cigarette, and took a deep puff. She raised her head, leaned back in her chair, with a slight smile. Ji Zhi sat in the hall for a long, long time, and suddenly, as if he had thought of something, he stood up, bowed to Mrs. Gan, and said, "Sister-in-law, please take care of everything. I've realized it now, and I'll do as you say." Mrs. Gan exhaled a puff of smoke and smiled at him. Ji Zhi saw that things were not good and pleaded again and again. Mrs. Gan stared at him for a long time, seeing that he had softened, and then smiled, "If you have indeed realized it, I will naturally help you. Don't worry, I will definitely not make things difficult for you." Ji Zhi saw that his sister-in-law's attitude was very sincere when she said this, and he didn't think she would tease him. Moreover, his sister-in-law could make most of the decisions regarding his brother's affairs. What his sister-in-law said was even more effective than what his brother said, so he could rest assured. However, because of such a serious warning, he softened completely. As soon as he returned from the office, he retreated into his study. For a whole week, he didn't dare to take a step outside. Miss Lao was a little anxious. What had she done to offend him? After their meeting that day, why did he suddenly stop seeing her? Could it be that the words he spoke to her that day were all lies? As he thought about it, this question deepened. He followed his previous routine, going to the street to wait for Ji Zhi at around four o'clock, so that they could talk on the road. (75)</p>

<p>Overseas Silver Market Falls</p>
<h3 id="e221">Gold Price Continues to Rise by Seven Dollars and Three Cents <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>Bad News from Foreign Telegrams Causes Midway Setbacks</p>
<p>Although the gold market continued to rise yesterday, sentiment was not very stable throughout the day, and the process was mediocre. Havas reported that the U.S. and Mexico were in talks to stabilize silver prices, which were very successful. Therefore, although the market rose in the morning, it was difficult to sustain it for long. In the afternoon, Western merchants speculated through Fu Chang, and a telegram from Mumbai reported a drop of six annas, creating the highest gold price (seven dollars and eight cents). However, foreign telegrams said that the U.S. planned to maintain the currency price and stated that if the pound and yen could also stabilize, a tariff war might be terminated, otherwise it would be hopeless. This telegram was related to the future of the gold market but was actually in a neutral position. Therefore, although the gold price turned around, it was still able to pull up, and the trend remained volatile. The price of "Hab Chi" was increased by sixty-one dollars, and the swap spread for May and June rose to about sixteen dollars. The market conditions for the day will now be recorded:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 983 dollars and three cents, an increase of four dollars and eight cents compared to the previous close. Goods opened at three dollars. The foreign exchange market opened with the British currency at par and the U.S. currency tight. The selling price for the near term was 1 shilling, 2 pence, 8125 for British currency and 24 dollars and 125 for U.S. currency. Tianfeng Yong Shangchang immediately sold, and the price retreated from three and a half dollars to one dollar and two cents. Mitsui bought U.S. dollars for August at 5625. Fu Chang, Zhifeng, and Yong all advanced. Hwa Bih also bought July at 375, rising to five dollars and two cents. Banks and brokers entered and exited suddenly, and brokers also came to sell strips. Bingxing, Yuanchun, Dadecheng, Tianfeng, and Yong all came to sell strips. Ruixing also sold. The gold price then fell to within two dollars. Qingfa, Yongfu, Chang, Zhaofeng, and Chang then advanced, with some struggle. When the banks bought August at 4375 and HSBC paid this month at 0625, Daxing, Yongqing, and Yong Xian bought to five dollars. Zhoufeng's listing was announced, with British currency at par and U.S. currency slightly tight at 125. At this time, it was still flat. When HSBC wanted U.S. dollars for June at 125 and July at 25, Dadecheng vigorously bought strips, and the price rose to six dollars and eight cents. Citibank came out with U.S. dollars for August at 375 and July at 1875. Yuanmao and Yong all sold, retreating to four dollars and three cents. Hwa Bih bought August at 4375 and was still able to recover. After hovering, the same traders wanted to fill August at this price but did not succeed. Zhaofeng, Changheng, Yiyifeng, Yongqing, and Yong started to sell off, falling to two dollars and eight cents. Hwa Bih bought August at half a dollar. Mitsui bought September at 625. Hengyu turned around to buy, gradually pulling up. Yuanchun sold strips, and retail investors pressed even harder, falling to two dollars. Hwa Bih bought August at half a dollar. Hengyu, Yiyifeng, Yongshunli advanced again to beyond four dollars, but Hwa Bih came out with August at 4375, and the trend was still down. Datong even filled July at 25. Hongli sold off. The afternoon close was 982 dollars and eight cents. Goods were auctioned at three dollars.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 982 dollars and a half, and goods opened at two dollars and three cents. Hwa Bih lifted U.S. dollars for August at 625, and Shunli came to advance strips to beyond three dollars. Goods were sold to two dollars and three cents. Macgary bought U.S. dollars for September at 6875. Fuyu advanced to beyond four dollars. A telegram from Mumbai reported a drop of six annas. Richang, Hongli, and Daxing Yong all advanced. Fu Chang even vigorously bought on behalf of Western merchants, and U.S. dollars for this month at 0625 were difficult to settle, so they reached seven dollars and eight cents in a rush. Hwa Bih came out with July at 25. Anda and Hwa Bih did a deal for May at 0625. Tianfeng Yong sold strips, retreating further to four dollars and six cents. Goods were lifted, and they rose again, then hovered. However, because Macgary came out with July at 25, and Dadecheng sold to within five dollars, Tianfeng Yong bought again and reached three dollars. Afterwards, the trend was stable, hovering around four dollars. Mitsui bought U.S. dollars for September at 0625. Yuanmao Yong advanced strips and stabilized. Mitsui continued to pay for August at half a dollar. Fu Chang bought again and rose to six dollars and three cents. Shortly after, the close was 985 dollars and eight cents. Goods were auctioned at six dollars. After the close, a telegram from Mumbai reported a recovery of three annas, which was slightly lower. The highest price for the day was 987 dollars and eight cents, and the lowest price was 981 dollars and two cents, a difference of six dollars and six cents. As a result, the close continued to rise by seven dollars and three cents compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price was reduced by 125 due to the HSBC bank's listing of U.S. dollars, amounting to 23 dollars and a half, and the alloy price was over 1021 dollars. Based on the closing price, it was about 35 dollars depressed, slightly less than 2 dollars less than the previous close. The book price for this month was 1015 dollars, for June was 995 dollars, and for July was 983 dollars. The water replenishment was 1015 dollars in the morning and 1018 dollars in the afternoon. The Hab Chi price increased by 60 dollars, but there were no transactions. These were all buying orders from the same industry. For the swap spread, Hengyu gave 140 strips to Dadecheng at 16 dollars for June and July, and Yuanmao Yong gave 35 strips to Dadecheng at 15 dollars and six cents. There were still 2,492 strips left for May and 6,328 strips for June.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still active. In summary, Tianfeng, Yongyuan, Mao, Ruixing, Yifeng, Yongyuanchun, Shunli, Hengxing, Xianghe, etc. were on the selling side, while Fu Chang, Qingfa, Yongda, Decheng, Richang, Hongli, Yuanmao Yong, Hengyu, Daxing Yong, Yuanheng, etc. were advancing. The Dalian gang and the Guangdong gang had no large transactions. As of the previous day, there were a total of 13,398 strips for July.</p>
<h3 id="e222">The Exchange Market: British Currency at Par, U.S. Currency Tight <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>

The far-term silver price decreased by 20%, but the decrease was only 50% for December and January. U.S. cotton decreased by 13 pounds, and private telegrams decreased by only 125. The near-term exchange market opened with British currency at par and U.S. currency slightly tight at 125, equivalent to 1 shilling, 2 pence, 8125 for British currency and 24 dollars 125 for U.S. currency. After the opening, it still showed a fluctuating situation, and banks and gold companies were seen buying and selling at times. HSBC and Mitsui were more active in buying and selling. The afternoon close was slightly tight. In the afternoon market, there were more bank buyers, and the process was slightly harder. The first telegram from Mumbai reported a decrease of six annas, which was the tightest time. Finally, it was still fluctuating. The closing selling price for the near-term was 1 shilling, 28125 pence for British currency, at par with the previous close, and 24 dollars 0625 for U.S. currency, tighter by 1875 than the previous close. Buying and selling in the banking and gold industries were tight. HSBC and Mitsui were more active in buying and selling. Sumitomo and Datong were trending to tighten. The result of the U.S.-Mexico talks on silver prices was satisfactory, resulting in a less tight process throughout the day. The day's bank transaction records will now be listed.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the "Hua Tou" (overnight interbank loan) plus water suddenly fell sharply, only reaching a rate of 1.78 cents, a sharp decrease of more than 2 cents compared to the previous day. The call loan market price remained the same, with a rate of 1 cent. Call loan note transactions were also far less prosperous than in the past.

<p>丨Swap Transactions Also Extremely Active丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Commercial Securities Exchange was buoyed by the trend towards the realization of peace in North China, and the market sentiment was strong. With only two or three days left for trading in this month's contracts, swap transactions in the market were active. Short sellers were squeezed, and few were willing to cut their losses. Large financial players, such as No. 46, still sold in large quantities, but the market price did not weaken, seemingly quenching thirst with poison. In the morning session, general sentiment was wary of continued selling pressure from No. 46 and No. 32 from the previous day, so the various listings were hesitant, rising and falling without consistency. Later, when unified taxes were auctioned, the surge to cover short positions raised prices by 3-4 cents. Although No. 46 sold this month's salt tax contracts, they still rose by 6 cents due to insufficient supply. The disparity between supply and demand for long-term salt tax contracts was absolute, leading to a sudden rebound, with a sharp increase of over 1 dollar, showing a strong trend. The next session saw a consistent increase of several cents. The 20th customs bond uniquely increased by as much as 8 cents. In the afternoon opening, the rising momentum still had remaining force, and the various listings continued to rise by 1 to 4 cents. Starting with the long-term 20th customs bond, a surge of selling suddenly turned the market negative, reversing to fall by 2-3 to 5-6 cents. The close then saw a consistent retreat of 1-2 to 7-8 cents, with only the long-term salt tax still up by 1 cent. The result was that, except for the current-month demobilization bonds, which fell by 1 and a half cents, the rest continued to rise by 1-2 to 8-9 cents, with a trend of large increases and decreases and considerable turbulence. However, No. 46 sold current-month salt tax contracts in significant quantities near the settlement date, indicating that they must have physical goods. Based on this deduction, even if there is a rising momentum in the future, it will be greatly affected. The total transaction volume was 16,600,001 dollars, including 16,000 dollars in spot goods, over 7.2 million in unified futures, 2.66 million in demobilization bonds, 2.02 million in the 19th customs bond, over 3.6 million in the 20th customs bond, and the rest ranged from several tens of thousands to over 600,000. Also, the settlement date for this month is the 26th, and futures trading for May will continue until the 23rd.</p>

<p>The yarn market is very firm, with continuing healthy actual demand. Various factories feel extremely difficult, and some yarn factories have reportedly completely stopped their weaving, causing a shock to market sentiment. There are fewer sellers, and the market situation is even more tense. What the future holds still depends on current yarn consumption.</p>

<p>In the morning opening of Human Trademark Cotton, foreign cotton fell again, with the near month remaining flat. When the far month was auctioned, the atmosphere was tight and brisk. Due to reports that the market sentiment in Tianjin and Beijing was stable and the situation was temporarily quiet, there were especially many new buyers. Each month rose by 1.3, 6, 7, and 9 cents. In the afternoon, it was heard that actual demand was good, and the market situation was still good. Each month rose by 3-4 cents. The total daily transaction volume was 81,850 bales. The following sales were recorded: Jifeng 1,800 bales, Suilong 2,200 bales, Senkang 2,200 bales, Changfeng 3,950 bales, Tonghe 1,250 bales, Gengfeng 1,950 bales, and Lichang 1,800 bales.

<p>The cotton market changes are still fierce. The opening situation in the morning was sharp, with extremely many buyers. However, a certain manufacturer dumped a large amount of 10,000 Dan, leveling the market sentiment. However, according to some, the current cotton inventory is extremely depleted, and the prices in various production areas are higher, so there is a very high expectation of price increases. The sales of current cotton are also gradually becoming active.</p>

<p>(Changzhou) According to news from the surrounding villages, due to economic reasons, ant rearing has decreased. In the Huainan, Daning, and Fengdong villages, the amount of silkworms raised by silkworm farmers is only 40% of last year's amount. Ant rearing is smoother in Yangqi, Daixi, Xueyan Bridge, and Maji Shantou. The weather is mild, and silkworm ants are developing smoothly. The early group has finished the third molt and are ready for leaf feeding, while the next group is feeding leaves during the third molt. The late group has just begun the third molt. In recent days, there have been thunderstorms, wind, hail, and sultry weather, and the silkworm ants have experienced delayed leaf feeding due to sleep deprivation and diarrhea. If the weather turns sunny and smooth in about ten days, a good silkworm harvest can be expected.</p>
<p>(Xinchang) Also a Zhejiang province-owned area for improving silkworm rearing. Many farmers are hatching improved varieties, and the silkworm ants are developing well, with the Huangze area being the best. The early group has already entered the major molt, the next group is also feeding leaves during the third molt, and the late silkworms are also in the third molt. In the recent days, thunderstorms and sultry weather have caused problems. The foreign silkworm varieties only have minor sleep deprivation and lotus leaf symptoms, while the local silkworm varieties have experienced diarrhea, yellow water, rotten bellies, and stiff deaths. Silkworm farmers are deeply worried. Mulberry leaves are sold at 4-5 cents per Dan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the first batch of Qimen black tea officially opened for trading. Top grade was offered at 180 to 200 yuan, middle grade at 140 to 150 yuan, and low grade at 110 yuan, a 70% reduction compared to the opening price last year. Tunxi’s Luzhuang Zhenmei green tea also arrived in Shanghai yesterday, with Tongfu Foreign Firm opening at 170 to 175 yuan, roughly 70% lower than last year as well. However, the new prices for Chouxin Zhenmei have not yet been released. Sales of Su'an Tuzhuang Wenzhou and other regional goods are not very active. The trends in the black and green tea markets are not considered optimistic.</p>

<p>Thirty to forty source locations; market conditions improved due to news of peace talks in the north, boosting confidence, and the bulk market became active. Although the Nanyang route suspended operations due to lack of ships, merchants from the Beiyang Gang (Tianjin, Haiwei, etc.) purchased over 1,000 bags of Bo Dao rice, causing the local market to become tight and prices to rise. Furthermore, due to overcast weather, the market showed further improvement. Higher grades of Su Tong Gang and Nangang Chang Gang Qingjiao Songsi rice were all offered at higher prices. However, middle grades remained stable. Although the overall situation saw a sudden turnaround due to peace talks and overcast weather, concerns remain about the market's prospects due to the approaching holiday season. Du Yangjian also saw a slight increase of a few cents. Weather changes bring neither glory nor shame.</p>
<h3 id="e237">North Shanghai <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>Over twenty source locations from Hexia; Baijing rice sales in Chenghua Xiangdian remained acceptable, with prices expected to remain high. Mid to low grades rose nearly a foot. Early Bojing rice remained stable. Xian rice prices remained steady. Cloudy weather reduced arrivals. Baiyuan rice showed a slightly weaker trend.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Few Foreign Xian Rice Transactions <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Foreign Xian rice from the Min Gang was still active, but the local market focused on Hexia rice and had not inquired about Foreign Xian rice for several days. This was due to ample supply of Hexia rice, and the recent hot weather prompted Hexia middle and low grade rice merchants to sell at reduced prices, fearing spoilage during transport. Foreign Xian rice arrivals continue unabated, especially Xiang rice, with arrivals and sales balanced, keeping the market steady. Foreign rice merchants held firm, causing the market to become bullish. The overall market opened with 406 bags of Jiangxi Wan rice, priced at 8.15 to 7.85 yuan; and 153 bags of Ji Zao rice, priced at 7.65 to 7.3 yuan; 450 bags of Hunan Ji Jing rice, priced at 7.45 yuan; 200 bags of Pi Jing rice, priced at 6.95 yuan; and 200 bags of Pi Jing sub-grade rice, priced at 6.1 yuan; 200 bags of Ji Hong rice, priced at 8.1 yuan; and 400 bags of Xiao Xiao rice, priced at 7.55 yuan. Of these, 100 bags of Pi Jing were purchased from Taizhou, with the rest bought by the Min Gang.</p>

<p>▲Although Foreign Wheat is Slight... Market Still Coarse</p>
<p>After the market opened yesterday morning, prices for all months showed signs of stabilizing. Although foreign wheat prices fell by about four, five, or six cents, some people believed that the Northern issue could be temporarily resolved, so even though overseas prices fell, the market remained stable. Therefore, the price fluctuations for all months were small. By the afternoon session, current month prices remained weak due to sluggish sales and showed little fluctuation. Forward months, however, saw slight buying by small factories and opportunistic buying by speculators, causing the market to become slightly bullish. However, larger factories were secretly selling, preventing the market from rising too much. As a result, the current month improved by 0.25%, June rose by 1%, July rose by 7.5%, August rose by 0.25%, September improved by 0.5%, and October rose by 1%.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Futures Wheat Market Dominated by Short Selling <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>▲August and September Are Best</p>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market showed signs of bullishness after the morning opening. Although foreign wheat prices fell by four, five, or six cents, recent weather has been unstable, with excessive rain affecting wheat harvests, and the possibility of a compromise in the North improved sentiment.  Flour sales may not be too sluggish in the future, so sentiment was good and opening prices were one, two, or three cents higher than the previous day. Later, there were fluctuations. By the afternoon session, all months turned quiet because of weak flour sales in the morning, causing market participants to wait and see. Only August and September contracts saw active trading, while the rest were dominated by short selling. As a result, August improved by 3%, and September gained 4%.</p>

<p>Although the sugar market saw a slight increase in auction prices and a slight decrease in the Dutch exchange rate yesterday, the overall trend was still normal. The Association priced No. 24 coarse granulated white, general, and exchange goods at 20.62 yuan, with some transactions, slightly lower by 0.1 yuan than the previous day. The price of No. 24 coarse granulated white arriving today was more favorable, priced at 20.6 yuan. No. 20 medium granulated white was bid at 20 yuan, and Nos. 8 and 9 Dutch Red were bid at 16.75 yuan, but no deals were made. Chang Yu Hang sold RA refined Dutch white at 21.7 yuan, and offered Guanghua Factory's Lu character at 20.08 yuan, Shou character at 20.02 yuan, and Mo Sha plus Guangbao at 21.1 yuan, with transactions in all grades. Factory prices saw Zhen Ji offer a batch of refined white sugar, with No. 1 at 20.1 yuan, No. 2 at 19.9 yuan, No. 3 at 19.7 yuan, No. 4 at 19.5 yuan, and No. 5 at 19.3 yuan, a decrease of four cents compared to the previous day.

<h3 id="e243">Public Opinion on the Sino-Soviet Railway Issue <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Yi</p>
<p>The rumor that Russia is going to sell the Sino-Soviet Railway has caused an uproar in public opinion. Not only have commentators in newspapers denounced the Russians for being unfriendly, but some "labor unions" and "public organizations" have also issued statements of opposition, as if the fall of the Northeast and the imminent danger to Tianjin and Beiping are of no concern, and only the sale of the Sino-Soviet Railway is more important than a bomb dropping on their heads.</p>
<p>The Sino-Soviet Railway is the best fuse for arguments between the Japanese monkeys and the old bear. We are hoping that they will really start fighting, which will agitate the monkeys. Then we can reach out and conveniently "recover the Northeast". Unexpectedly, this bear is extremely cunning. It doesn't want to argue with anyone. If the monkeys want its Sino-Soviet Railway, it will simply sell it off, leaving the monkeys with nothing to argue about. This has upset us Chinese who are waiting for its forceful intervention, and we are loudly protesting:</p>
<p>"Aren't you, old bear, opposed to imperialism? Why are you compromising with imperialism again!"</p>
<p>Even the words that we once used to scold "red imperialism" are now being denied. Chinese people have this skill.</p>
<p>But even commentators who oppose the sale of the Sino-Soviet Railway say: "Although our Northeast is currently under the control of Japanese imperialism, being trampled by violence, there will eventually be a final reckoning, and one day the property will be returned to its original owner." The evidence is that our government is still "resisting while negotiating." And there is also a "long-term resistance plan." Since the entire Northeast is now merely "lodged outside the home," and the puppet state is coming forward to buy the Sino-Soviet Railway, it will still be ours in the future. So what does it matter whether Russia sells it or not? If it is really sold, it can even save us a sum of "railway redemption funds." Wouldn't that be cheaper? Then isn't it strange that public opinion is so agitated!</p>
<h3 id="e244">Heavenly Secrets <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Jingzi</p>
<p>It is difficult to speak, and even more difficult to listen. Because it is difficult to speak, language becomes more and more obscure day by day, so that it makes you understand and not understand at the same time, just like reading the Tui Bei Tu and Shao Bing Ge, only later can you fully understand. Because it is difficult to listen, most people simply choose not to listen, but only open their eyes wide to look. Because although the Tui Bei Tu and Shao Bing Ge are difficult to understand, there will always be facts to explain them afterward.</p>
<p>Not long ago, someone said: "Because we cannot fight, we must resist; because we cannot make peace, we must negotiate." The words were beautifully spoken, sophisticated, and considerate, satisfying both those who advocate war and those who oppose it, those who advocate peace and those who oppose it. But whether to fight or to make peace makes people more and more confused. Phrases such as "long-term resistance," "negotiate while resisting," or "we will resist when the enemy comes" all contain endless articles in a few simple words. Because there are articles, they are obscure. This is the transformation of language into the Tui Bei Tu.</p>
<p>Recently, someone said again:</p>
<p>"The current situation is like a lane with more than ten houses. The first two have already caught fire, and three or four are about to catch fire. If we do not quickly isolate them, the rest will burn together."</p>
<p>Also said:</p>
<p>"Someone is pressing my neck with a sharp knife, not killing me immediately, but forcing me to fall. Now that I have not fallen, there is still a chance to save the situation. Once I fall, it will be beyond salvation."</p>
<p>This is of course another Tui Bei Tu with a lot of articles. If the words were spoken like this: "The first two houses are on fire, quickly get the fire engine to pump water and put out the fire;" or "Someone is pressing my neck with a sharp knife, and I will return it with a sharp knife. Now that I have not fallen, I will fight to the death," then it would be dull and there would be no articles to write. And if the listeners were to ask: "Why only demolish the walls and not use fire engines to put out the fire?" "Why do I sit and wait for death when someone is pressing me with a sharp knife?" This would naturally be a stupid person who doesn't know how to listen.</p>
<p>The way to read the Tui Bei Tu is not to speculate from the literal meaning itself, but to understand and verify it from the facts outside the words. So, what are the facts outside of demolishing the walls? First, the "traitors" and "rumors" are compromising with Japan; second, "enemy," "rebel," and other overly stimulating words are all being avoided; third, the military situation in North China has temporarily ended, and the entire line has entered a state of truce; fourth, after ××× arrived in Peiping, people's hearts were greatly stabilized, and everyone believed that there must be a proper solution. Enough, just looking at these four points, can't we also glimpse the heavenly secrets of the Tui Bei Tu?</p>
<p>However, glimpsing heavenly secrets is ultimately not an easy task. Most of the ignorant people can only listen to "fate" in the dark until the walls have been demolished before they know. What happens when they know? After all, people cannot pick up stones and break the sky. Naturally, this is precisely the wonderful use of "heavenly secrets"!</p>
<h3 id="e245">Outside the French Park <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Tao</p>
<p>1.  One morning in late spring, the whole city was awakened by the sounds of workers at work. On the sidewalk outside the French Park, two former subjects of the Russian Empire, a woman in her forties with a child of seven or eight, were walking quietly. She was always so calm, as if nothing was worth her attention.</p>
<p>The child walking in front suddenly turned around!</p>
<p>"Mom! Can we take a look at the park before we go?"</p>
<p>She didn't answer him, as if agreeing and not agreeing. But her child couldn't resist, stomping his feet and clinging to the cement railing, looking greedily at the inside of the park like a hungry eagle chasing after food.</p>
<p>"Mom! Deer! Deer!"</p>
<p>She also leaned against the railing and looked inside.</p>
<p>Like the rest of the White Russian women, her face was always stern, without a hint of a smile. She wore a floral cloth on her head, and her wide coat wrapped around two breasts like gourds. She used to be a noblewoman, and few people would believe it if you said it. Her child wore an old peaked cap and a set of clothes made from his father's old clothes, looking very pitiful. But if it weren't for that cursed revolution, he would have been a nobleman, a hereditary title, worthy of respect. But now everything is over, everything has been destroyed by the thugs in their country. ...</p>
<p>Looking inside, two large deer and one small deer were confined inside a wire fence, walking so listlessly. She thought:</p>
<p>"Ah! This is really pitiful!"</p>
<p>She looked again. Under the shade of the trees, a couple was talking softly and walking, the man gently holding the woman's waist, face to face.</p>
<p>"Ah! ......"</p>
<p>The child was watching a girl put a doll on the ground, so he didn't pay attention to his mother's sigh.</p>
<p>She suddenly fell into deep thought.</p>
<p>When she married Dakov in Paris in 1918, the priest who officiated at the wedding also said that this young couple was happy. At that time, she certainly didn't expect to end up in the situation she was in now. At that time, they believed that they would be able to drive the thugs out of the country in a short period of time and return home safely. Who knew that now they were drifting to Shanghai, and the country was still occupied by thugs. ...</p>
<p>"Ah! What can be done? We have drifted to Shanghai." She thought to herself, "Ricky's father, for the sake of life, abandoned the dignity of a prince and carried a grinding machine to sharpen foreign knives for people. Ah! What a shameful thing!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Spring is on them!" She couldn't help sighing.</p>
<p>"Ricky! Go back!"</p>
<p>"Um! ......"</p>
<p>He obviously had his eye on that doll, on that little girl's doll.</p>
<p>She looked at the little girl again:</p>
<p>The little girl was wearing a dress with a large collar, and a butterfly was tied in her hair. She scooped the sand into a tin box, and next to her was a doll, which was exactly what Ricky wanted.</p>
<p>"Bansen! Come!"</p>
<p>"Ah! Louis."</p>
<p>"Did you bring the foreign gun?"</p>
<p>"I brought it."</p>
<p>"......"</p>
<p>"........"</p>
<p>She turned around to look at Ricky, and she sighed again:</p>
<p>"Spring is on them!"</p>
<p>She pulled Ricky forward, but Ricky was still looking inside the park. She suddenly thought of her husband sharpening foreign knives for people, and she sighed again:</p>
<p>"Spring is on the wealthy!"</p>
<p>"Mom! ......" Ricky didn't understand what she meant and stared at her with wide eyes.</p>
<p>"Ah, child," she said, "when you grow up, you must return to the motherland. Even living with those thugs is good!"</p>

<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(30) A Study of Kong Yiji</p>
<p>When I first read Lu Xun's "Kong Yiji," it seemed to depict a "bookish fool" from my hometown. In the local dialect of Hunan, the term "bookish fool" always refers to a clumsy and unsuccessful scholar. This is still a respectful term; with a slight mockery, they are directly called "tung oil can" or "broken chamber pot." When I first started school, I also learned to write "Shang Da Ren Kong Yiji" in my tracing book. The schoolmaster was a type of bookish fool, so he was a bit higher than Kong Yiji. After reading Kong Yiji, I used this nickname to refer to the waste of the eight-legged essayist class, viewing the terms bookish fool, tung oil can, and broken chamber pot as far more vulgar and more brilliant. Recently, I borrowed a note from my friend Mr. Zhigang's reading manual, copying a passage from the Ming Dynasty scholar Ye Sheng's Shui Dong Diary: "Shang Da Ren, Qiu Yiji. Hua San Qian, Qi Shi Er Shi. Er Xiao Sheng, Ba Jiu Zi. Jia Zuo Ren, Ke Zhi Li. Shang Shi You Shan Shui, Zhong Ren Zuo Zhu Lin. Wang Sheng Zi You Xing, Ping Zi Ben Liu Xin. Wang Zi Qu Qiu Xian, Dan Cheng Ru Jiu Tian. Shan Zhong Fang Qi Ri, Shi Shang Yi Qian Nian. The above sentences are what all children in rural schools use when imitating calligraphy. They all start with this, which is called tracing in red. Everyone passes it on and learns it, almost all over the country, but no one knows what it means. Some say that it only takes simple strokes, with no other meaning; others say that the meaning is clear and understandable, and that it has a source." The Qiu Yiji mentioned here is Kong Yiji. Zi's name is Qiu, which needs no explanation. Ming people learned this tracing book from the beginning, but did not know where the language came from. In the Dunhuang anthology, there is a passage in the education category that says: "Shang Da Ren, Qiu Yiji. Hua San Qian, Qi Shi Er. Nv Xiao Sheng, Ba Jiu Zi. Niu Yang Wan, Yue She Tun. (The editor notes in the margin: The following handwriting is blurred and unreadable.)" It can be seen that this tracing formula is very old, probably dating back to before the Tang and Song Dynasties? And Kong Yiji will be immortal.</p>

<p>New Year's Day (continued)</p>
<p>Carrot Top: Just be patient for a moment, Mom will be done soon.</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: It's very literary, but the handwriting is too bad, I can't read it at all.</p>
<p>"Okay, Dad," Carrot Top said quickly, "now it's your turn."</p>
<p>As Carrot Top stood straight, waiting for his answer, Mr. Lepic read the letter over and over again, scrutinizing it for a long time, and making a few "Ah! Ah!" sounds as usual. Then he put the letter on the table.</p>
<p>This letter is now useless, its mission is over. It now belongs to everyone. Anyone can look at it, take it. Sister Ernestine and brother Felix took it in turn, looking for some spelling errors. Carrot Top should use a different pen nib here so that others can see it more clearly. Then they returned the letter to him.</p>
<p>He turned the letter over and over, smiling stupidly, as if asking:</p>
<p>"Does anyone want this letter?"</p>
<p>Finally, he stuffed it back into his hat.</p>
<p>At this time, Mrs. Lepic distributed New Year's gifts to the children. Sister Ernestine got a big doll, and brother Felix got a box of lead soldiers ready to fight.</p>
<p>"I bought you something unexpected," Mrs. Lepic said to Carrot Top.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: Ah, is that so!</p>
<p>Mrs. Lepic: Why do you say: Ah, is that so! Since you knew, then I don't need to give it to you.</p>
<p>Carrot Top: If I knew, then I would never see God.</p>
<p>He raised his hand high and said solemnly. Mrs. Lepic opened the cupboard. Carrot Top gasped. She reached into the top of the cupboard, all the way to her shoulders, slowly and mysteriously, and took out a sugar-glazed pipe made of brown sugar.</p>
<p>Carrot Top's face shone with joy without hesitation. He knew what to do now. Soon, he would be smoking in front of his parents, under the envious eyes of his brother Felix and sister Ernestine (but no one can have everything!). He only pinched the sugar-glazed pipe with two fingers, bent over, and tilted his head to the left a little. He pursed his lips into a circle, tightened his cheeks, sucked hard, and made a sound.</p>
<p>Then, he looked up and pretended to exhale a big mouthful of smoke:</p>
<p>"This pipe is very good," he said, "it's very smooth."</p>
<p>Back and Forth</p>
<p>The two little Lepics and Miss Lepic returned from vacation. When jumping out of the public carriage, when he saw his relatives from afar, Carrot Top thought:</p>
<p>"Should I run to them at this time?"</p>
<p>He hesitated:</p>
<p>"It's still a little early, I'll run out of breath, and I shouldn't show it too much."</p>
<p>He hesitated further:</p>
<p>"I'll start running to them from here............, no, start from there..............."</p>
<p>He asked himself some questions:</p>
<p>"When should I take off my hat? Which of the two should I hug and kiss first?"</p>
<p>But brother Felix and sister Ernestine had already rushed ahead of him to divide up the affectionate caresses. When Carrot Top arrived, there was almost nothing left.</p>
<p>"Why, you're so big, and you still call Mr. Lepic 'Dad'?" Mrs. Lepic said, "You should say 'My Father' to people and shake hands with him, that's how a man should be." (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e248">Tacit Understanding <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Niu</p>
<p>In the past, the format of letters often ended with words such as "tacit understanding," or "clear understanding," etc. At the time, I didn't pay much attention to it, thinking it was just a habit in writing letters. Now, looking at the newspapers, I suddenly realized the wonderful use of tacit understanding.</p>
<p>Tacit understanding means heart-to-heart, which also means mutual understanding. Your heart is known to me, and my difficulties are also understood by you. To go a step further, your heart is not only known, but can also agree to my difficulties; not only understood, but can also be followed. However, for the sake of face, or fear of others gossiping, it is not convenient to show anything clearly. Speaking of men and women, our love has reached full maturity, but because of parental opposition and the ridicule of others, we can live together, but we are embarrassed to officially exchange accessories and hold a wedding ceremony. This is an example of tacit understanding.</p>
<p>I once heard old hands at seduction and theft say that a wife is not as good as a concubine, a concubine is not as good as a prostitute, and a prostitute is not as good as theft. Secret affairs are the most interesting. Therefore, people abandon their wives and specialize in private affairs with other people's adulteresses. The so-called privately sold salt becomes more popular the more it is banned. If you look at the facts, this woman has been raped, her reputation has been ruined, her innocence has been stained. Even if you go to court and file a lawsuit, it will be useless. You might as well marry this rapist. But in fact, it must not be so dirty. She is still a good, pure woman.</p>
<p>Such a shameful thing, if it comes from someone with no personality or no prestige, then we don't need to say anything more. But if it is after all, a young lady from a noble family, raped, and it just ends quietly, then I'm afraid it will be difficult to do.</p>
<p>Now, people who read newspapers are at a very high level. They often don't look at the front, but prefer to find the reverse. They not only want to look at the reverse, but also want to verify it with facts, which is really annoying. In fact, this is just creating trouble for yourself. The best way is to "leave it to fate" and "let people do what they want." The so-called "if you're not foolish and deaf, you won't be a head of household." This is the attitude that we ordinary people should have. If you want to be smart, or pretend to be insightful, and insist on breaking through their back walls, then you can't remedy it, and you can't resist it. You are just asking for trouble.</p>
<p>Enough small talk, national affairs are important. Now that Peiping and Tianjin are so tight, and it is heard that once a certain branch president arrived, the hearts of the people in Peiping and Tianjin were greatly stabilized, and the Japanese offensive was suddenly eased, just like eating a dose of cooling medicine for a fever, making people feel refreshed all over. It really has unexpected effects.</p>
<h3 id="e249">News Brought by the Spring Breeze (Continued) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Ping</p>
<p>Awakened from a daze by the sound of knocking, I opened my eyes to find the sunlight filling the window. A friend burst in, saying, "The dishes at Wanhua Tower will sell out soon, hurry up and let's go have morning tea."</p>
<p>Emerging from Wanhua Tower, we walked to Jinshan. It was nearly noon, the sun beat down, we took off our jackets, wiped our sweat, and strode forward. The new surroundings certainly made me forget the sorrow I left in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Jinshan Temple isn't as magnificent as Lingyin Temple in Hangzhou, probably gaining its name from the story of the White Snake flooding Jinshan. At the foot of the mountain is the Fahai Cave, said to be where Fahai attained enlightenment, likely also a tool for the monks to collect money. The entire Jinshan isn't as joyous as its name suggests. Climbing the Jinshan Pagoda, one can see the white-thread-like Yangtze River. The peak of Jinshan is right here. We sat atop the pagoda, our collars open to the wind, as my friend pointed out Jiaoshan and Ganlu Temple. Our plan was to visit them in the afternoon, but due to the unavailability of boats, we changed our itinerary to the Purple Bamboo Grove and Zhaoging Temple. As for Jiaoshan and Ganlu Temple, one glance from Jinshan Tower was probably the last we’ll see of them.</p>
<p>Proceeding from Jinshan Temple, we passed through a willow-lined path straight to the First Spring Under Heaven. The monks were warm and welcoming, the First Spring Under Heaven was cool, thick, and refreshing. The four of us chatted with the presiding monk in broken Zhenjiang dialect, losing track of time for two hours. It's a pity I can't grow old in this village, sipping tea every day, chatting idly with the old monk.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, we hired rickshaws to visit Purple Bamboo Mountain, a newly built automobile road in Zhenjiang. After leaving the city, the flat road seemed buried in the middle of ten thousand mountains. The rickshaw meandered forward, watching the endless road stretch on, sitting in the rickshaw felt like a vague dream.</p>
<p>The Purple Bamboo Grove is built in a mountain depression. Viewed from the plains, it appears only as towering ancient trees. Ascending the stone steps, the temple foundation gradually rises with the mountain's incline. At the highest point is the Yijiang Pavilion, with a view far surpassing Jinshan Temple, because nearby are countless nameless hills, quietly elegant,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>and far removed from the world, with the faint sound of bells wafting over, we sat in the Yijiang Pavilion, unwilling to leave.</p>
<p>"Ping, this place is great for treating lung ailments. You can borrow a small room from the abbot, and in two months, your wife won't recognize you," my friend said.</p>
<p>I didn't answer, staring ahead, though I didn't actually see anything. Before my eyes was just an impenetrable dark cloud.</p>
<p>Although C was usually joking and carefree, in such situations he was particularly perceptive. Seeing that an awkward atmosphere was about to develop, he grabbed my hand and said, "Let's quickly visit Zhaoging Temple and order some songs at the Pagoda Forest." He even mimicked the pidgin Zhenjiang dialect, and with forced laughter, we continued forward on the avenue.</p>
<p>But my friend's words still resonated in my ears, in rhythm with the cartwheels. People spend exorbitant sums of money to feign illness, some even travel abroad for ailments that Chinese medicine can't cure. On the cart, I recalled my brother's words: "The poor can't afford to be sick, being sick isn't for the poor!"</p>
<p>I am working while ill, my brother is studying while ill. The sorrow I left in Shanghai returned to my memory. As for Zhaoging Temple, I merely climbed up and down the stone steps.</p>

<p>Mr. Jiamenglú, "Four Quatrains on an Rubbing of a Buddhist Association's Bronze Bell Presented to the Japanese Earthquake Memorial Hall." Grief and indignation overflowed in his words. Disregarding my own inadequacy, I respectfully follow his rhymes. My intent is slightly different, hoping that the sound of the bell across the sea, like a lion's roar, can awaken our deeply slumbering compatriots! I do not shy away from the criticism of adding to something already excellent. I leave it to the experts to correct.</p>
<p>The bandits from Jiangnan just ceased their eastward advance, and now the northern gate's lock is opened again: The generations-old feud between Wu and Yue is forged into iron! Hearing the bell's sound, courage collapses.</p>
<p>Bearing the burden of the people and the nation's pain, Half of the land is entrusted to heaven's calamity. A different meaning can be found in rise and fall, The White Horse Temple is rebuilt as a Buddhist field.</p>
<p>Are the standardization of script and vehicles entering Lu a heavenly punishment? The three households that destroyed Qin are shrouded in obscurity. The bell across the sea seems to inquire, When will the sleeping lion unleash its thunder?</p>
<p>The two peaks have exhausted the depiction of monstrous demons, Buddhist rain can hardly quell the rise of evil thoughts; The day will come when the East Sea is turned to dust, And we'll watch the ashes and talk of Kunming! (A Response)</p>
<h3 id="e251">A Small Piece of Land's Dispute <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Bai Fu</p>
<p>Although the island nation's Royal Army has not yet reached Beiping, our Beiping intellectuals and patriots have long transported batches of valuable books, instruments, and specimens to the South. Some schools have even moved entirely to the safer South to study. Relying on heaven and Bodhisattvas, they have safely retreated. I believe that if Beiping could be moved, they would move the entire city to the South.</p>
<p>While these many patriots safely retreated, only the Beiping Library remained unmoved. It is certainly a strong institution. But according to the director, the reasons for not moving are: first, because there are too many books to move; second, because many intellectuals in Beiping rely on the library to make a living. By copying books and writing articles in the library, they can earn a living by submitting them to newspapers and publishing houses. Moving the library would take away these intellectuals' livelihood, causing them to face unemployment. Third, our director believes that even if the island nation's Royal Army reaches Beiping, it is only a political issue, unrelated to culture. The Royal Army won't necessarily destroy his cultural institution—the library that intellectuals rely on for a living. Yes, the fall of a nation is indeed due to political issues. Perhaps when the Royal Army arrives in Beiping, they will not only refrain from destroying his cultural institution but also issue a commendation to our director for diligently preserving culture by not moving the books.</p>
<p>However, the Beiping Library is certainly stronger than those patriots who fled in terror at the sight of the Royal Army. Let's set that aside for now and just talk about those patriots who prepared to retreat safely. According to reports, since the Ministry of Education organized the Labor University Management Committee, there has been no solution for its disposition. National universities in Beiping, fearing the danger to Pingjin, have sent representatives to the capital to request the Ministry of Education to allocate the Labor University site for use in relocating their schools to the South. A national university in the South, seeking to develop its future, has also sent representatives to the Ministry of Education for consultations. The various parties have been arguing for many days… etc. Goodness gracious, this small piece of land has caused our patriotic intellectuals to argue for many days. Although no swords or guns were drawn, the back-and-forth of verbal battles may have led to parched lips and exhausted tongues. But after this long and inconclusive battle of words, the patriots of Beiping, those educators! have failed. Therefore, they returned to Beiping disappointed. It is said that due to the tense situation and the danger to Pingjin, they will advance the start of summer vacation!</p>
<p>That small piece of land finally belongs to So-and-so University and the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College. Apart from the unhappiness of the Beiping patriots, this writer also feels dissatisfied that the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College has been allocated this small piece of land. It is said that the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College's educators, also patriots, were concerned about the fall of the East and West and wanted to develop the Northwest early to strengthen national defense. As the name suggests, the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College, committed to developing the Northwest, should go to the Northwest. However, they insist on competing for land in Shanghai, which is full of foreigners. Shanghai, in addition to being developed by our noble compatriots over thousands of years since opening up to foreign trade, has also undergone painstaking development by foreigners. Now, roads extend in all directions, tall buildings stand in rows, and it has become one of the world's major commercial ports. Does it still need the patriots of the Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College to develop it? Perhaps Shanghai is a place where all types of people gather, a place where Eastern and Western cultures converge. Since its commerce has reached the level of a major international port, its universities and schools, large and small, are the best in the country. This is the center of modern Chinese culture. The Northwest Agricultural and Forestry College is also one of our new and emerging cultural enterprises in China, so naturally, it must be established in the cultural center to promote the glory of Chinese national culture, right?</p>

<p>— Jin Xin</p>
<p>The God of Love, Venus, has been very annoyed recently. She thought, "I am a goddess! How can I work tirelessly like a machine every day?" Her job, of course, is to connect the "golden threads of love" between men and women. But recently, because free love has become so popular in the human world, her work is not as leisurely as it used to be. She wants to lighten her workload, so she pleads with men in the world:</p>
<p>"Men of the world, I beg you! Don't love those demon-like women anymore! They will drain your blood, suck your strength, and consume your great spirit."</p>
<p>She also says to the women of the world:</p>
<p>"Gentle and beautiful women of the whole Earth! I urge you not to love those rogue-like men anymore, okay? They will ruin your beauty, bind your will, and deprive you of your freedom. They are like bird catchers. As soon as you fall in love with one of them, you will be caught in his trap, and you will become his property entirely."</p>
<p>However, the men and women of the world, as if not hearing her advice, are still happily loving each other, pursuing the taste of love. Not only have love affairs not decreased at all, but they are increasing day by day. The God of Love is greatly disappointed; the leisure she hoped for will not materialize. She is both angry and tired. In the end, she decides to go on a passive slowdown.</p>
<p>From then on, although the God of Love, Venus, is still performing her duties, she is not as serious as she used to be. She often connects the threads of love incorrectly or breaks them halfway, causing the young men and women of the world to feel countless sorrows and worries.</p>
<p>Shop Clerk's Communication</p>
<h3 id="e253">Loss of Property <a href="#e253" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c253" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">253</a></h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>I am a newly trained shop assistant in a cigarette shop, only a month out of my apprenticeship. Last week, I encountered an extremely unfortunate incident that I cannot justify. One morning, the shop owner ordered me to exchange one hundred yuan of small silver coins (double dimes). This is a very common occurrence recently. I counted the banknotes, stuffed them into my short-sleeved shirt pocket, and went out. After passing through the Maijiaquan area, I turned towards the Daigou Bridge. When I arrived at my destination, I reached into my pocket for the money. It would have been better if I hadn't touched it. The result of this touch made me cry involuntarily. It turned out that the pocket on my short-sleeved shirt was two-thirds broken. Only two corners of the pocket were still connected to the shirt itself. The bottom part was completely detached. At the time, I didn't know the details, so I put the money inside and walked on the road, causing it to be lost. Seeing that the exchange of small silver coins was impossible, I had to return to the shop crying and explain the situation to the owner. Who knew that the boss, upon hearing this news, showed no sign of forgiving me? He severely scolded me and even asked the guarantor to write a letter to my father, trying to negotiate compensation. My father is a low-ranking clerk in the Hankou Military Medical Office, with a monthly income of only over ten yuan, which is not enough to cover monthly expenses. Where would he get the money to pay this compensation? I really don't know how to solve this matter! So these days, I've been restless and unable to eat or sleep. Sir, what is the proper way to resolve this matter? Please give me a response in a short time. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Zhuang Zipei</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>Editor's note: In theory, Zhuang should be held responsible for</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>compensation for this matter. Because the shop owner hired a clerk, he naturally has the right to ask him to handle business. If a clerk could lose property under his care during his duties and not be held liable for compensation, then the social order would not be able to be maintained. However, according to the letter, Zhuang's shop owner's attitude is good. His "lack of forgiveness" and "severe scolding" are unavoidable for most people. He asked the guarantor to write a letter to your father to "negotiate compensation," which, although aimed at compensation, still leaves room for negotiation in the amount because of the words "negotiate." The words "find a way" suggest that there may be flexibility in the timing and method of payment. We believe that you should also ask your father to come forward and negotiate on the basis of these four words, "negotiate" and "find a way." Request a discount on the amount and ask for a feasible payment schedule. This would already be considered generous by the shop owner. Hoping to avoid compensation altogether is impossible. The future is long, and your future is worth more than just one hundred yuan!</p>
<p>Here, we want to warn all shop clerks to be careful and cautious with the property they handle during their duties. Because once a loss occurs, even if it is known that you did not embezzle it, you cannot escape the responsibility of compensation, whether legally or emotionally.</p>
<p>Finally, we must also say to the public, "You should not keep lost property for yourselves." You should know that for you, it is unexpected wealth that you can live without. But for the loser, it may often lead to despair. Appropriating lost property is legally less severe than theft. However, morally, it is more severe than theft. Because the victims of theft are mostly members of the propertied class, while losers often include poor young men like Zhuang. The responsibility for theft can be avoided with the words "force majeure," but the responsibility for loss is undeniable.</p>

<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Twelve. A fragment of life three</p>
<p>One spring afternoon, the warmth of the sun poured in softly, most easily leaving one with a lazy languor. The concubine Liu, probably because of the excessive heat, finally woke up again. She listlessly moved her body slightly, and felt her entire body to be clammy, covered in sweat. She stretched out her hand and pressed the electric bell a few times, as a gust of cold air rushed into the bedding, followed by a violent fit of coughing, and when the maid He Xiang came in, she noticed fresh streaks of blood in her phlegm.</p>
<p>He Xiang walked to the side of her bed, her eyes filled with passion, tears hanging in the corners of her eyes, as her lips were slightly parted, panting on the pillow. He Xiang really had a good heart, and had been secretly worried for her since the concubine Liu had started coughing up blood a month ago, even more than once. However, she didn't try to dissuade her much now, as she had said a few earnest words a few times before, but the concubine Liu always smiled, clearly not taking her words to heart, and had even replied with a bitter smile once:</p>
<p>"Stop nagging, I know you mean well, but even if I listened to your words, would you be able to live a poor life with me? Silly girl!"</p>
<p>These kinds of words, though not scolding her, always left her feeling a little unappreciated. So now, she simply sighed and went into the bathroom to prepare a bath for the concubine Liu.</p>
<p>The concubine Liu sat in the tub, examining her body, which had indeed become much thinner recently. So she immediately recalled the mad attitude of manager Gu last night, and everything went black before her eyes, but she immediately tried to stop this thought, and began pouring warm water onto her bosom.</p>
<p>He Xiang knocked twice on the door, before lifting the curtain and standing in the room. She said softly:</p>
<p>"Young Master Zhang came once at nine o'clock today, it was really ridiculous, coming so early. Then he came again at eleven o'clock, trying to barge in, saying he had to see you, Miss..."</p>
<p>"Which Young Master Zhang are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"The one who sent a picture once."</p>
<p>"Sent a picture? There are so many pictures, how can I know who you mean?"</p>
<p>"Then should I get it for you to see?" She said, starting to run outside, but the concubine Liu shouted to stop her:</p>
<p>"Who wants to see it? I am asking when Master Gu left?"</p>
<p>"Probably around eleven o'clock. He told me not to disturb you. He was walking to the door when Young Master Zhang came in."</p>
<p>As the concubine Liu sat in front of the vanity table, facing the mirror, she put on the string of pearls manager Gu had recently given her. Frankly, the amount that she was violated last night was indeed more than that string of pearls was worth.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the phone rang, followed by the happy laughter of the maids. Then He Xiang came in and said:</p>
<p>"Miss! That Zhang person called again, saying he will be coming to visit you soon." Then she added quickly: "Men like that are rare. But he really is very handsome. They all say he is both young and good-looking." Soon, she smiled mischievously and went out.</p>

<h3 id="e255">The Private Life of Mae West <a href="#e255" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c255" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">255</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Ying</p>
<p>Paramount's Sex-Symbol Star</p>
<p>Romantic Lead in "She Done Him Wrong"</p>
<p>"She Done Him Wrong," recently screened at the Guanglu and Lanxin theaters, caused a sensation in the United States and led to the "Go West" slogan. Of course, the general public has already been captivated by its star, Mae West. Mae West's style has created a unique niche in the American film industry, enough to alarm moralists and overturn playboys. She completely transcends the abstract realm of sex appeal and specializes in the tangible allure of sex to attract men. And according to the conviction derived from general observation, the target Mae West wants to move is not the soft-skinned, tender young man, but hard-boiled men over middle age who have experienced the vicissitudes of life. She herself is in middle age and her style is extremely hard-boiled. The Lady Lou she plays in "She Done Him Wrong" has large breasts and even fuller hips, which are not what young men truly seek; what they want is just a beautiful face and a slender figure!</p>
<p>What is said here is, of course, not what moralists are willing to discuss, because Mae West and moralists are fundamentally irreconcilable. Mae West has had many encounters with moralists in the United States, but Mae remains true to herself, unwavering and not showing the slightest sign of surrender. Mae West's slogan is "Give him as much sex as possible, and not simple, ordinary sex, but Mae West style sex." So on the stage or on the screen, she puts sex appeal first. Because of performing sex appeal, she was not tolerated by the moralists or church people in small cities, so she was imprisoned for ten days on Blackwell's Island. Many of the political dance dramas she starred in were banned or detained. She had ample opportunities to escape punishment, but she bowed her head obediently and walked through the prison door. Her reason was that imprisonment enhanced her fame. Sure enough, her deeds were widely reported by newspapers across the United States, and her desire for fame was finally fulfilled.</p>
<p>But it is said that Mae West's own nature is not so lewd and romantic. Just as people see her plump body on the screen, weighing a full one hundred and sixty pounds, but in reality, she weighs only one hundred and eighteen pounds, and the rest is dressed up by Paramount costumes. When she leaves the theater and the crowd and returns to her secret private residence, she returns to her original appearance. She is just an ordinary woman! There is nothing too hard-boiled about her. She can also be coquettish or cry, and she is also very emotional, not too eccentric. Her only hobby is diamonds. Her fingers, neck, and chest are often covered with dazzling things, more than the brass studs on the dog collar!</p>
<p>Mae is married. Her husband's name is James Timony, a famous lawyer in New York, full of wit and talent. Timony and Mae West were both born and raised in New York, both from humble backgrounds. Mae first met Timony when she asked Timony to resolve a small case. After they met, they were like magnets and iron filings, firmly attached and inseparable.</p>
<p>In addition to acting, Mae can also write. She often revises or completely changes the screenwriter's script because the script is not sexually suggestive enough to suit her identity. Timony also helps a lot in this regard. And Mae West's success is largely due to Timony's vigorous support.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e256">Review of "Awakening" <a href="#e256" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c256" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">256</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Nan</p>
<p>If the audience is not forgetful, they will surely feel that this film "Awakening" is derived from Jane Eagels' "Father's Sin." The reason why the Central Film Censorship Committee praised it is because every aspect of this film surpasses the records of any small company production. On this point, I do feel that the general trend of the Chinese film industry is moving towards the bright road.</p>
<p>The story is about a village girl who meets a primary school teacher. Later, because of her parents' forced marriage, she disregards everything and runs away with him to Shanghai to live together. Tempted by material things, the young man becomes enamored with a dance star. At the same time, he loses his job, and he goes to Beiping with the dance star. The village girl has given birth to a son but cannot afford to raise him, so she has to become a dance hostess. The young man is abandoned by the dance star in Beiping, and she takes away all his property. Helpless, he can only beg his way back to Shanghai. By then, his wife has been divorced, and only a six-year-old orphan remains at home. Only then does he greatly awaken. He exchanges labor for food and clothing, and he becomes an extremely honest person. His son also receives help and goes abroad to study. The fallen village girl, due to a conflict between dance patrons, is unjustly accused. Because one of her old customers is a major thief, she is sentenced to fifteen years in prison. She is released from prison when her son returns home to marry, during the time the whole family is watching. The young man never forgets the love of the village girl. He learns that she has become a beggar and immediately goes to the snowy ground to bring her back.</p>
<p>Ideologically, this film can indeed serve as a wake-up call for young people, tearing down the modern mask, revealing the intoxication of infatuation, and at the same time promoting ethics and morality. This type of work is rare.</p>
<p>Director Wen Yimin can be said to have improved ten thousand times compared to before. However, it is a very good film, but it does not take a new path. Using a dance hall to describe the city inevitably falls into clichés. Technically, the director has learned the strengths of European and American films, and it is not forced at all. The cinematography is also very good, able to harmonize yin and yang, strength and gentleness. The set is also quite impressive. The flying paper and dancing cloth in the room are because there is no glass greenhouse, which seems excusable, but it can also be said to be negligence. Although the camera lens is good, there is one major flaw in the whole film, which is that the actors move too fast, walking like running. There are not many subtitles, but there are also many aphorisms.</p>
<p>Fan Xuepeng's performance is the best. Her portrayal of the pain suffered by a village girl, her efforts to try to be modern, is very moving. In particular, her repentance after "awakening" is quite subtle. The supporting roles are relatively inferior in comparison, but they are actually all very good.</p>
<p>This film does not fail as a good work because it is able to have the power of satire.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, there are still some small loopholes in ideology and technique. To protect domestic films, especially those produced by small companies, I will not mention them. Generally speaking, those who are interested in domestic films will all find it good.</p>
<h3 id="e257">Review of "Woman and Jewels" JewelRobbery <a href="#e257" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c257" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">257</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Indeed, William Powell's appeal in movies is not insignificant. Yesterday, the audience at the Cathay Theater was noticeably larger than usual. Because of this, we might as well start by examining the actor's performance.</p>
<p>Of course, we must admit that Powell's acting skills are indeed outstanding, and he plays the leading role in the film. Taking "Woman and Jewels" as an example, his performance is truly pleasing. When he leads a group of robbers to loot a jewelry store, he is so alert and agile, and at the same time, elegant and dashing, as if trying to portray the special demeanor of a so-called master thief. We have seen many such master thieves on the screen, but are they exactly as he portrays them? Unfortunately, we do not have that kind of experience, so we cannot rashly judge. However, in Romantic works of art, people are often amazed. Therefore, Powell here gives the audience a relatively deep impression. Later, he courts the woman, showing off a lot of jewelry in front of the Baroness, leading to a tender engagement. Regarding these, we also acknowledge his thorough "craftsmanship." However, those who do not understand the fickle love games of "golden quality" will not be moved by him.</p>
<p>I remember a few years ago in the silent film "Prosperity Dream," he played a very loyal and honest small businessman at a gas station wearing glasses. That kind of loyal and sincere performance is still unforgettable to me. But here, he transforms into an elegant and dashing master thief, but compared to the aforementioned film, it always feels insufficient.</p>
<p>Regarding the supporting roles, I don't think it is necessary to mention them one by one. A good film cannot succeed without good supporting roles.</p>
<p>However, the director's skills are also worth noting. The best scene is the robbery in the jewelry store. He portrays each of the robbers as shrewd and capable, while also not letting go of anyone being robbed. Of course, these scenes are entirely theatrical, without credible reality. However, he is able to pay close attention to the most minute details, which is not easy. Secondly, when the robbers appear at the Baroness's house, he intentionally sets up many doubts to raise the audience's tense mood. Also, disguising a suspect to look similar to the master thief is where the director shows off his cleverness. His ridicule of the Baron and the exposure of luxury also shows that he has quite a bit of artistic cultivation.</p>
<p>As for the story itself, it is clearly entirely fictional, but in its literary position, it has the special characteristic of "satire." However, it is only a well-intentioned "mockery" of real society, which the screenwriter certainly considers necessary. However, "women," "jewels," and "robbery" will naturally not be improved as a result. That's all.</p>

<h3 id="e258">My View on "Rouge Market" <a href="#e258" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c258" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">258</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Bing</p>
<p>Incomplete Awareness, Unstrained Structure</p>
<p>Indeed, recent domestic films have shifted from martial arts and erotic themes to rural and urban aspects. But recently, it is obvious that the issue of women's liberation has become the subject of films, as can be seen in the advertisements of various companies. And "Rouge Market," filmed by the Star Film Company, is one of the best.</p>
<p>Regarding the awareness of the whole film, there are thorough aspects and vague aspects. Li Cuifen is an ordinary woman, so when Li Mingyi dies, her old mother is seriously ill, and there is no rice to cook at home, she resolutely throws herself into the role of a female employee. What is this for? It is only to make a living, and there is no slightest thought of "understanding society." Afterwards, Cuifen is deeply stimulated, so she fights against the evil environment and eventually opens a small shop for the enjoyment of the rich. Regardless of whether it is actually allowed, if women's employment is only this little bit, it is inevitable that there will be a lack of limited understanding.</p>
<p>The structure is also not tense; especially the last scene where Guohua and Cuifen meet again is boring. I suppose the screenwriter still has a trace of the traditional concept of "reunion" in his heart? Also, Cuifen was originally a very self-respecting woman, who resigned voluntarily because she did not want to be bullied and teased by others, which is quite fitting for her identity. But later, because Miss Yang persuaded her to understand society, she went to beg the company again, hoping to be hired. Although she did not succeed, is the only place to understand society a department store? Furthermore, the various types of women's occupations, such as switchboard operators and copyists, are shown one by one, which shows the director's ingenuity; but the insertion points are not as good as expected. I think the ending of the whole play would be best if Cuifen said "We are still friends" and then the black curtain gradually fell. Then, what kind of scene will unfold in the minds of the viewers? It is a pity that the screenwriter also neglected this.</p>

<p>— Zui Ying</p>
<p>Chaplin was very naughty as a child. He didn't care about his homework in class. The teacher shouted himself hoarse on the podium, teaching in many ways, but he was still appreciating the photos of movie stars in his hand. But his pair of flexible eyes constantly looked at the teacher's movements, and when he saw him walking over, he quickly flipped the photo over, like a blank piece of paper, pretending to be recording there. But his kind of hypocritical trick was eventually seen through by the teacher, but he was calm and unhurried, and even said to the teacher with a grin: "Teacher, this is a photo of a certain movie star, very precious, if you love her, I will give it to you."</p>

<p>— Si Ping</p>
<p>A Goldwyn production starring Helen Hayes</p>
<p>Sacrificing Honor and Happiness for Love</p>
<p>"I do not know," Angela lifted her head, meeting passionate, adoring eyes. Her alluring gaze swiftly lowered again.</p>
<p>"I know. He fell madly in love. What is the woman like?"</p>
<p>"What woman?" Angela, with guileless eyes, looked up at him.</p>
<p>"The woman he's in love with." He returned her glance ardently.</p>
<p>"I have not seen her," she murmured, scrutinizing her tea.</p>
<p>"I have seen her." He regarded her steadily. "She is very beautiful丨she has alluring eyes丨her nose is straight丨"</p>
<p>"You must be drunk," Angela said sincerely, but instantly regretted her blunder. "I often say the wrong thing. I often trouble Ernastus."</p>
<p>"Who is Ernastus?" he asked anxiously. The mention of the name seemed to dispel the spell that had enveloped them. They reached out their hands to part. Angela shyly withdrew her hand from his grasp.</p>
<p>"I am engaged to him," she said.</p>
<p>"Oh!" Giovanni exclaimed, as if relieved of a burden. "I thought丨perhaps you loved someone else!"</p>
<p>"Ah丨of course, I love him," Angela said simply. She glanced at the watch on his arm. "Heavens!" she cried, rising and enveloping herself in her shawl. "Where is Mina? I must go."</p>
<p>Giovanni helped Angela into a streetcar.</p>
<p>Mina, agitated, ran frantically back to the palace. She wished Angela had returned safely. But she was not at the palace! Her alarm was great, and she immediately put on a calm face, pacing back and forth in the garden waiting. Prince Schermond wandered to her side and asked if Angela was inside. She answered vaguely, and as she saw the Prince wander off, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Outside the high walls surrounding the garden, far from the large iron gates, she glimpsed a streetcar arriving and stopping. Angela's face looked out anxiously from the car window. Then, the car doors opened, and she slipped out of the car丨Giovanni followed. She paused and extended her hand.</p>
