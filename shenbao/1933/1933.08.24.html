<p>時評</p>
<h3>不必灰心元</h3>
<p>自抗日救國捐之問題起。一時輿論沸騰。人心憤慨。主張清查者之言曰。「國人不惜絞汗血。毁家財竭其所有以紓難救國而乃被經手捐欵之人。中飽濫用。則我國民將聞而灰心。誰肯再熱心救國。」而經手捐欵者之言曰。「我人不避艱難困苦。奔走呼號廣集捐欵。以援助抗日工作。結果非特不諒。反蒙侵呑朋分之嫌。則後之熱心救國者。能不聞而灰心。」兩方皆以灰心爲言皆言之有理。然而吾人以爲我國人殊不能因此灰心。自九一八以後。我國人自動援助抗日軍之熱烈。爲從前無論何種國難所未見之現象。蓋從前之所謂毁家紓難。僅於水旱偏災流行時見之。至於爲國家抗禦外侮而踴躍捐輸。則絶少概見。故今日國民之捐欵抗日一時雖未見有何成效。而已足表現我民族自奮救國之動機吾謂此一線動機。今日正宜培養而擴大之。國家前途之危難甚多。正賴我民衆本此一息之天良。進而發揮我全民族之能力團結我全民族之精神。以荷負此挽回國運之大任。倘此一線動機。而遽爲目前不幸之問題。無端窒塞。其關係寗能目爲細小况乎此所謂目前不幸之問題不過爲一時疑雲所籠罩。一旦查明之後清者自清。濁者自濁濁者自爲國人所棄。而清者則益顯其人格之高尚。而愈爲國人所信仰。世界苟尚有眞是非終必有水落石出之一日。我國人初不必因一時之憤憤而灰心。并隳我全民族救國之勇氣也。</p>
<p>抑我人更有言者。今日之事。非特不可灰心。更當因此而加倍努力。在此社會混淆黑白不分之際。人心又日趨麻木。見義勇爲之人。未必得人信仰。而乘間取巧因利自便之徒反爲衆口所交推。人無論若何公正。而社會對之。必存幾分懷疑之心。無論若何善念。而終必以惡意測之。於此而欲有所作爲。必其人願併名譽犧牲之而後可。否則惟有袖手坐觀而已。此種社會狀態。悠悠忽忽。糊糊塗塗。非一朝一夕所成。實亦無法以糾正之。今者清查救國捐之舉。正一糾正社會人心之好機會也蓋此問題一經澈查之後。眞相可立即明白數日來陰霾晦蒙之現象。即可一掃而空。此後熱心輸財救國之人。可深信所捐之欵有所保障。决不擲諸虚牝。而經手捐欵之人其眞坦白無私者。於個人信用。亦有所保障。决不爲無根浮言所毁損。如此則正可激勵其急公好義之心。奮進於一致救國之路。又安所用其灰心哉。</p>
<p>以故清查會收捐機關與一般國民皆希望中央派員澈查。其關係不僅爲此一次之救國捐。而實關係將來之無數救國事業。中央果能以公正無私之態度。迅速澈底清查。則人民非特不灰心。且可奮起無數之救國人心。倘若視如其他請派大員辦之例案。因循敷衍。或含胡不了了之，則是非終不能明。眞足灰我國人之心矣。</p>

<p>本埠新聞</p>
<h3>海外僑胞最近狀况</h3>
<p>往昔商業多佔勢力</p>
<p>最近則日趨於衰落</p>
<p>中央社云、僑胞在海外貿易、在昔頗佔勢力、年來因各國經濟、多不景氣、僑胞受其影響、失業者萬計、而南洋一帶、橡錫各業衰落、僑胞虧折更甚、相率返國者甚多、又因墨西哥等國厲行排華、致海外僑胞立足地、益形困難、中央社記者昨特訪本埠華僑聯合會總幹事黃建中、詢以關於華僑年來近况、承答詢甚詳、並特該會最近調查海外華僑各種相示、茲分誌</p>
<p>如次、</p>
<p>各地人數　據最近調查、華僑散居於海外者、以南洋羣島爲最多、歐美各地次之、北澳南菲更次之、南洋羣島方面、計越南約四十二萬人、暹羅約二百萬人、緬甸約三十萬人、馬來半島約一百八十萬人、荷屬東印度羣島約一百二十萬人、英屬婆羅　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　波羅洲約十萬人、（以上係根據各該地移民廳調查）南北美洲方面、計美國約八萬人、加拿大約六千人、墨西哥約二萬人、古巴約二萬人、巴拿馬約二萬人、危地馬拉約二萬人、牙馬加約二萬人、檀香山約三萬人、巴西約二萬八千人、秘魯約五萬人、歐洲方面、計居於倫敦·馬賽·海牙·比利時·等地者、共計約三萬人、居於聖路易、及馬達加斯加·羣島者·共計約二萬人·澳洲方面、居於澳大利聯邦者約五萬人、亞洲方面、計日本約四萬人、朝鮮約四萬人、臺灣約三百萬人、印度約三萬人、西伯利亞約二十五萬人、香港約六十萬人、澳門約八萬人、（以上係根據各地海關調查）共計約一千零二十七萬八千人、</p>
<p>商業狀况　華僑在海外營商、亦以在南洋一帶爲最有實力、南洋僑胞所業以橡膠爲主、錫業次之、加菲胡椒等業又次之、橡膠價格、昔日每擔價値二百餘元、現在則低至十餘元一擔、相差達二十倍、損失之大、於此可見、橡僇價賤、橡園遂停止割取、營業無形停頓、致華工失業者以萬計、此不獨橡業爲然、錫業等均受同樣之損失、至華僑能在南洋一帶佔有地位者、因握有經濟實權、現因橡錫各業襄落、損失極鉅、故今後華僑在南洋一帶之經濟地位、勢將因之發生影響、至於在歐美各國之華僑商業、亦因各國經濟之不景象、漸受壓迫、亦年不如年、若不立即挽救、則海外華僑、勢將無立足之地、</p>
<p>受人排斥　年來海外僑胞多被外人賤視、如墨西哥之排斥華僑、暹羅之規定敎育條例、强迫華僑讀暹羅文字、新加坡之限止華僑入口、荷屬東印度之嚴查華人進口手續、并規定貨物附價税、安南之限止移民等、均已一一實行、其他未實行者尚多、故華僑在海外營業益形困難、希望國人注意及之、</p>
<p>團體組織　海外華僑、均極勤苦、於各種</p>
<p>事業、均有相當之進展、即以商業一項而論、亦因善於經營、居然能操南洋一帶經濟之實權、至近來則日見低落、茲據該會最近調查、華僑在各地所組織之中華商會之數目、即可知華僑在該地商務之狀况、計秘魯二十二所·爪哇十七所·菲律濱十二所·馬來聯邦十二所·南北婆羅洲九所·朝鮮六所·蘇門答臘六所·日本四所·智利四所·西里伯島四所·澳洲三所·安南三所·美國三所·加拿大三所·墨西哥三所·緬甸三所·暹羅二所·古巴一所·Z巴拿馬一所·檀香山一所·共計一百十九所、（此外如南菲洲西印度等、均有華商會之組織、未列入）</p>
<p>敎育狀况　至於華僑在海外各地所創立之中華學校、計爪哇二百所·蘇門答臘八十所·馬來聯邦六十所·新加坡五十所·南北婆羅洲三十二所·美國二十所·菲律濱二十八所·安南十八所·西里伯十所·邦加十二所·答里龍同十所·荷屬寥内八所·荷屬勿里洞八所·加拿大八所·秘魯六所·緬甸六所·暹羅十六所·朝鮮六所·丹那底三所·共計五百八十三所、</p>

<h3>東北在滬採辦麵粉</h3>
<p>中國土布亦有運去</p>
<p>九一八以後之創聞</p>
<p>東北自被日本强占後、商貨往來、因僞國强收二重税、故各帮多已停辦、致近來滬上航行營口、安東·各埠之商輪、往來貨運、不過一二成載脚、致華商輪相率改航他處、即英商輪船、亦復减班、詎近一週來、東北方面、忽在滬採辦大宗雜糧、購訂麵粉尤多、中國土布、在九一八後、即斷絶運至東省、刻亦開始來滬購辦、今日太古之安東輪船出口、本埠有運往東北之麵粉四萬五千包、又我國土布一百五十件、洋布三百件、均裝到安東上陸、轉入遼·吉·黑·各省、此項去貨、均繳納兩重税、蓋自九一八發生以來、上海貨物之運入東北者、要以此次爲最多、即輪公司亦認爲特殊情形也、又大連汽社自近一旬以來、東北去之出口營業、頓時激增、但該社所運者、則以滬上日本紡織廠之布疋爲多、</p>

<p>春秋兩椿奇聞  嶦廬　　擁有萬兒的　統　　中國又多一聖人　　世界上擁有多子的元首是誰？以住古而言，當然是周文王的「則百斯男。」以近古而言。明洪武帝，清康熙帝，都是擁有多子　　的；多雖多，不過數十人罷了。至於，擁有萬子的，　的唯一無二，德國現任總統興登堡，可以翘得大拇指的了，這是最近的一椿奇聞。　　中國近來多了一位聖人是誰？這不是康聖人，康聖人已作古了；也不是董聖人胡聖人，董胡兩聖人的尊　，是人家故意弄這玩意兒的，並不是他們自稱爲聖人。現在提起的一位聖人，是他自命爲聖人，而且，見之於公牘　　，鑿鑿可據，自稱爲：「鄙人乃性之聖者也。」這人是誰？昔之性博士，今之性聖人，張競生是也；這也是最近的一椿趣聞。　　興登堡擁有多子，不是他親生兒子，是分的義子。只爲，大戰以來，德國感受人丁减少的痛苦；興登堡提倡着努力製造國民，凡是民間養到第六個兒子，便把這兒子認做總統的義子。這麽一鼓勵，德國人丁就此激增，興登堡的兒子遂漸加多，竟達到萬人以上，都是八十四歲老總統的乾殿下，眞可算得「多福多壽多男子」了。　　詩經上雖有「具日予聖」這一句，但是，自稱爲聖人的究不多見。孔老夫子不敢自居爲聖，孟老夫子聽得門弟子算他爲聖，便道一句：「惡！是何言也？」張競生博士，本係潮州饒平人，近在饒平實業督辦，造林與築路，均收相當的效果。上星期，有人用饒平改進會名義，攻許張防害風俗等十罪狀；張大憤，馳電自白，中有：「競生自糼卽浸在我國好禮數之内，今已四十餘載，意能以禮自持，　居數載，凡一切常人在性上所不能堅持者，本人均能打破此難關，故敢説鄙人乃性之聖者也。」云云。伊尹是任聖，伯夷是　聖，柳下惠是和聖，數千載來，又加上了一位張競生的性聖。古語云：「聖人出而黃河清」，現在多了一位性聖人，黃河之水，怎麽汎濫　江蘇來呢？古語不是信，如是如是。兩性生活的鬥爭  棲鳳樓主　　提高女權，提倡女子職業，要求女子生活獨立，這一類的口號，社會上早已聲斯力竭地狂喊了多時，更不用我再來瞎鬧了。不見嗎？機關裏的女科長，書記，學校中的女校長，敎員，各大公司内的女寫字，女店員，和女律師，女記者，女探員，更推而次之，女理髪師，女侍役，女伶，舞女，按摩女，賣花女···等；一時也説不完，社會上如今已有了這多的女子職業，差不多從前男子所做的工作，現在彷彿都已由女子取而代之，還不是女界的光榮，社會的推進，國家的好現象嗎？　　自從女子職業發展以後，女權自然而然的隨之澎漲起來，但是在生活問題上，却與男子發生了鬥爭，男子原有的地位，就因之而動搖起來，待到最後，畸形的社會往往爲新奇的驅使，崇拜女性，就遺棄了男子的職務，以女子來代替，可憐的男子，就要感到失業的痛苦了！現在我國的失業人數，雖没能詳確的調查，但其數必很驚人！這也是兩性鬥爭結果的原因之一。　　其實：女性辦事成績，是否都駕乎男子之上，固然是個疑問？不過比較上，伊們似乎抓得一個「靜」字吧了。至於「學識」和「經騐」誰勝過誰，須視各個之所近，也不便肯定來下斷語。總之；兩性生活的鬥爭，將來還要劇烈！若然男女雙方，同具相等程度，相仿學術，前去謀一個業務，我相信人家一定歡迎女性而受雇，鄙視男子而遭擯斥呀！我更神經過敏的預測一句：依照現實社會的情况看法，數十年後，男子倘没能特長的技能，和過人的藝術，恐怕難以站到生活台前，與女性一較身手哩。瓔珞隨筆  曾蜀　　沙漠中的清水，是旅客們救命的泉源；潰堤下的洪流，是災民們葬身的壙穴。嚴厲的訓斥，和娓婉的責備，那是你迷惘於黑暗中的燈塔；你切不可誤認爲含有敵意！　　戀愛的滋味是甜的，但在結婚和產生愛的結晶品以後，就自然要感到辛辣和酸涩的味道。　　金錢是萬能的！它能使宇宙的一切，都在它的威力下屈服，膜拜；但有時它又很怯懦地受着人們的支配，驅策，眞令人奇怪！　　人生正好像戲劇，世界就好像舞臺；吾人追逐在人海的浪濤中，祇看你扮演的是悲劇或是喜劇？談「三」  興之　　小子没有專攻過什麽指事，象形形聲，會意，轉注，假借，的六書，不知道這「三」字的造成，但據小子個人的目光看來，這三字的形狀十分整齊，或者因之很能夠討人歡喜，常在口中發現，然而「三」字是好是壞，是凶是吉，自從東三省拱手轉讓之後，小子一直没有想出來，大概道「三」字是有好有不好的字眼罷。　　孫總理發明的三民主義，所用的是個三字，據説外國人都很信仰，這個三字可謂榮耀之極。孔夫子老聖人説：「不孝有三無後爲大」，這三當然不能如三民主義的三稱雄天下，但倒是我國專爲這國民　生　的衣架　　們所　　　科玉　的，並且和三民中的一民民族主義有同一宗旨，增加生殖。所以不孝有三的三，還沾光着三民主義的哩。　　天地人稱做三才，夏商周稱作三代。夏禹商湯周文武稱作三王。伏義神農黃帝稱作三皇，日月星稱爲三光，春秋時孟孫叔孫季孫稱爲三家，父族母族妻族稱爲三族，金人封口愼言謂之三縅。孟母訓子而三遷，他如三字經，三從四德之三從，三生有幸之三生，以及明時，挺擊紅丸移宮之三案，君臣父子夫婦之三綱等，都可以知道古時喜用三字之甚，還有懦釋道的三敎，張良蕭何韓信的三傑（蜀漢諸葛亮關羽張飛亦稱三傑）山農澤農平地農稱三農，周禮禮記儀禮的三禮，左傳公羊傳榖梁傳的三傳，通典，通志，通考。的三通，蘇洵蘇軾蘇　的三蘇，無一不三，三字應用之廣，也可見一斑了。　　宋秦檜誣岳飛有罪，韓世忠問秦檜：「岳飛有什麽罪」？秦檜祇答了「莫須有」三字，致岳飛於死地，後來就拿「莫須有」三字稱爲誣無辜於死罪的三字獄，直到現在仍舊有很多的人引用莫須有三字嘆息岳飛。　　做事模仿謂之三脚猫，歐洲火器印刷器，羅針盤謂之三大發明，羅馬之三頭政治，立法司法行政之三權分立，以至於盛行於現代的三角戀愛，馬路上的印度阿在，流浪漢的尊稱小瘪三等等，都是現代最盛行無一不知的「三」足與古時的三相媲美的。　　以三命名的事物眞可謂不勝枚舉，但我們在今日之下，不可瞎三話四，應當三緘其口才對呢！東北四連長  張恨水　　第十四回　　授室多艱徘徊憂後顧　　邀朋小聚靦覥記前塵　　　趙翁在屋子裏這樣哈哈大笑，那笑聲直達到外面院子裏去。桂枝在他自己屋裏坑上坐着，也不住的微笑。過了一會子，江氏回來了，他一推門進來，見桂枝盤了腿在坑上坐着，昂了頭，微微的發笑，母親進來，他也不曾理會，依然的昂了頭向頂棚望着，不斷現出笑容來。江氏究竟是個守舊的人，看了這種情形，心中很有些不以爲然，就向桂枝正色道，剛才你到後面院子去過了一躺嗎？桂枝紅了臉道：我聽到後面院子裏，笑着説着，非常的高興，我猜不出什麽事，讓你這樣高興的，所以偷了去瞧瞧。怎麽着？這又惹着你什麽不高興了嗎？説畢，就鼓起了自己的臉，埀下眼睛皮來。江氏淡淡的一笑道：這倒好，你是猪八戒倒打一耙，我並没有説你什麽，你倒用話來堵上我了。好！我以後全不管。江氏如此發一頓子急，桂枝倒不再生氣，却噗嗤的一聲笑了。江氏歎了一口氣道：我要説你什麽呢，又怕讓趙家聽了去了，現在年輕的人啦？唉！他重重的歎了一口氣，自坐到一邊，抽他的旱烟袋去了。這一天晚上，桂枝覺得自己總有點不對，也不敢對母親有什麽聲辯，自去睡覺了。到了次日正午，桂枝正由街上買東西回來，却看到關連長臉上帶了沉吟的樣子，一直向家裏來了。他不看見人，桂枝也不去驚動他，趕緊跑回家去，就把裏面屋子的一方破舊門簾埀了下來。天氣已是稍稍暖和了，江氏正在下面屋子裏洗衣服呢。只聽到關耀武在院子裏呌道，大姨在家嗎？（一六七）揮汗隨筆  朱戮　　秋，雖已悄悄的降臨大地，然而纍日的炎威，依然未减；寒暑表常升在八十度以上，人假使動手作事，汗液早從皮膚中分泌出來了。是的，一班胼手胝足的勞工，兀自終日沐在交流的汗液裏，追求生命的糧食。這篇揮汗隨筆，却是我爲糧食掙扎的作品。　　這幾天的果品，西瓜已漸漸成了過時的東西；然而常熟出產的當溝瓜，依然保存着固有的地位。這種瓜，皮是白的，瓤是白的，子也是白的，所以俗名又呌做三白西瓜。那西瓜的　，鬆脆甘美，汁甜於蜜，確是解渴妙品。此外桃子和藕，也是這幾天當令的果品。蘇州的藕，原是很有名的，那種藕出產在葑溪門外十里荷香的荷花蕩裡，肥如腿，白如粉，别有風味。今年農村没落，百物低賤，藕祇賣二百文左右一斤，眞便宜了一班饕餮大家。桃，蘇州也有幾家園圃出品，嫩蜜色的果實上，微微敷着一層臙脂，色彩是這種嬌艷，那甜美的味兒，更使人吃了，甘留齒頰。　　蟠桃，也是桃的一種，形狀圓而扁，好像一隻小小的盤兒，有的核兒還露在外面，聽説瑤池三千年開花三千年結果的桃兒，就是這種蟠桃，吃吃可以使人長生不老。這雖是神話，但蟠桃的味兒，確也不錯，不過出產旣少，價値也昂，比較水蜜桃，就覺物稀爲貴了，花紅，葡萄，棗子，也一起上巿了，鮮艷的顏色，雲蒸霞蔚，堆得像彩錦一般；是的，這是金盤乞巧，雙星渡河的時期了。　　茉莉，粤名暗　，佛經名　華，粒粒白萼中，吐出濃郁醉人的香氣，愈到晚上，香氣也愈見濃烈。那種花最得婦女們的歡心了，用銀絲扞着紮成圓圓的花球，懸掛在輕紗衫子的襟頭。每當月上柳梢，微風薦凉的當兒，那馥郁的花香，和着脂香粉氣，氤氲地暗送過來，此情此景，眞不知醉倒了若干男性，顚倒了多少青年！　　衣服到了熱天，總要取出來曝曬一番；憑藉着驕陽的熱度，將衣服中的濕氣除去，以免霉蒸和蟲蛙。在曝曬衣服的時候，却也有一些小小常識；顏色的衣服，曬時外面須罩一件單衫，以免衣服曬着陽光，發生褪色或變色。皮的衣服，尤忌直接囇在日光裏面，否則皮的光澤，就要逐漸减去，變做枯悴的了。衣服曬好後，尤需先在陰處凉透，然後把包好的樟腦或茶葉，放在衣服裏，一起疊在箱中，才可免去蟲蛀和脱毛之弊。　　通行汽車，已變成蘇州一件熱鬧的時髦的問題，反對贊成，聚訟分紛紜，平心而論，在蘇州狹窄的街衢上，駛行汽車，確乎尚非其時，但蘇州是有名的勝地，不過風景區域，因道路的崎嶇，交通的不便，没有杭州和莫干山的吸引能力。現在由朱夢梅建議在風景區域，建築公路，行駛汽車，據説這項建議，已深得人們贊同，上方山麓，已由石湖整理委員會籌築公路，石湖面上的杏春橋，已在改建水泥鋼骨的新式橋樑，此外胥門外的萬年橋，也在籌備改建計劃了。　　近幾天來，秋風秋雨，天氣已慚感到嫰凉，尤其是早晚的時候。我想在不久的將來，秋氣漸漸地深，凉意漸漸地濃，一般苦工，當不致再嘗汗液交流的苦况了。每當唧唧蟲聲，從窗外度上枕來，想到「蟲聲新透綠窗紗」詩句的當兒，我的心靈上，不禁得到深切的慰安。</p>

<p>申報國貨週刊國貨論壇吳稚暉先生與二百五國貨  仰葊　　慣説俏皮話之吳稚暉老先生，最近正襟危坐，高唱英「摩托救國」之偉論，大言炎炎，小儒爲之咋舌。新中華雜誌且出摩托專號以張之。第一篇即爲吳老先生这傑作，鼓勵摩托救國，無微不至。且謂國人迷戀於此，當如上癮之鴉片，成癖之馬將，男女老幼心有所思，思之，口有言，言之，必望飛機惟中國人最精，能持續此榮譽，亘數百年，萬國百科全書中，一華飛」一名詞，能占累頁。吾讀其文，吾心怦然。惟文中獨於祖國之國貨，詆哄甚至。一則曰及外貨之充溢，經濟瀕於破產，始起爲二百五之國貨以　之。再則曰以習慣製造二百五國貨之民族，陳列巿上之工藝品，粗劣止如冥器店像眞这狀態者，能助飛機之自製，將在何時？　　吳老先生或者近來奔走政治太忙，未暇一究最近國貨界之現狀，與機製工藝品進步之情形。不然，不但其言不合吾國眞相，且蔑視慘濬經營不遺餘力之國貨界太甚矣。最近五六年來我國民旣不甘雌伏爲習慣製造二百五國貨之民族，人人出其心思村力專精致志於機製國貨之創造。犧牲無數之精力，無數之時間，無數之金錢，始將「中國國貨」四字，嶄然露頭角於工業競爭之時代，凡衣食住方面之用品，壹皆自給自足，無待外求，不但粗劣如冥器者之　有，且已有許多出品，早與歐美工藝品相頡頏，且已駕日貨而上之。試舉其例，華生之風扇，其耐　力較之歐美貨何如？較之日貨更何如？試問果眞爲二百五之民族，能製造如此之國貨乎？此種國貨，果爲冥器店中物乎？事實勝於雄辯，吳老先生盍於從政之暇，一爲考究及之乎？吾爲此文，吾恐吾國貨界同人驟聞此説，因而自餒，更恐吳老先生之說，轉輾流傳，足以阻遏國人熱心從事國貨之銳氣，故一爲剖白，以勵國人之熱心國貨者。國貨談話國貨產銷現狀與將來  玄萬　　荆棘重重暗礁時伏的我們國貨界前途，雖然年來辛勤果敢，努力進行，已造成了不少光榮成績，大可自慰，但是，他外來的侵襲，潮流的激盪，總還是一息不停，有加無已的來臨，最近的狀况，我國貨於銷行的前途，忽又深患着阻滯的弊病，而生產過剩的陰影，重複照射到各個國貨工廠的序幕，雖説在一切都不景氣的年頭裏，社會上無論什麽都呈現着衰落，那麽我們國貨又何能獨免，但凡事之欲求其眞相之由來，必先須經過詳密之調查，而然後可着手進行挽救之法。　　明顯的事實，他告訴我們是現下國貨衰落的原因，是由於生產量高過消費力，所謂「供過於求」，產銷雙方不能平衡，而不平衡的原因，却就是我們所急須注意的兩點：　　一，是外貨傾銷，奪去我們國貨巿場，尤其是可惡的仇貨，他竟不惜改面換頭，假冒國貨，偷漏關税，種種不法，但求成本之低廉，實行其傾銷之手腕，據上月份海關報告，仇貨輸入於長江沿岸，較前月陡增兩倍，其影響於我們國貨銷路，自不待言。　　　　二，是農村破產，内地社會經濟崩潰，購買力一蹶不振，致使國貨行銷無從。　　我們根據這兩點，已可深切明瞭，在這種情勢下，國貨工廠祇以「减工」或「跌價」來維持生命，是不對的，現在的治標計劃，却第一先要設法防止外貨傾銷，尤其是要嚴密檢查仇貨情形，增加税收，弗使猖獗，第二是工廠自身問題，將要怎樣地去多採内地原料，力謀成本减輕，價格低廉，迎合國人心理，有了這點應付，然後我們可再等候内地經濟復興，與國人澈底覺悟，不用洋貨等根本問題的解决。　　熟諗現况，希冀未來，這生產與消費，是任何一國社會經濟中的兩個礎柱，我國貨廠商對於增加生產，果是最主要的目的，而關於消費方面，亦切不可忽視，蓋消費增加，就是生產的出路，舉凡一切足以阻碍消費的障碍物，我們自然都要竭力掃除，務使產銷雙方都有進展，絶對平衡，以漸臻「產销合作」之途。國貨調查我國之機製牙刷業  懷成　　牙刷是人人所必需的日用品，其需要之普遍，理應與人口的繁殖成正比例。但是我國的情形，就大體言之，除稍具衛生常識者外，一般内地的人民，往往以爲這是近於奢侈而不甚需要的用品，甚至認爲刷牙是一件麻煩的工作。所以產銷兩方，尚不十分發達。　　我國巿上所銷的牙刷，向分手工與機製兩種。手工牙刷，各地均有，而以廣東佛山爲策源地，機製牙刷，出貨迅速，機造進步。　廠製造，始創於民九，廠名堅志，資本二萬元，以鹿頭爲商標，其創辦人即今心心廠之經理沈天眷君。彼時正當日貨充斥，以初創之工業，受環境之壓迫。自多種種困難，二年後即移歸江灣模範工廠接辦，堅志之後，於民十，有雙　牙刷廠之組織，資本較鉅，規模亦大，迄今雖數經變更，其出品依然行銷巿上。嗣後有素以經營手工牙刷之粤商梁新記，亦繼起改用機器製造。民十四，復有一心牙刷廠崛起。經理常心誠君，原係雙輪廠發起人之一。對於製造方面，有相當經騐。故其出品精良，銷路亦廣。從此歷來傾銷之仇貨「衛生牙刷」，漸見改少。　　國内機製牙刷工廠，據調查的得，上海有八家，天津二家，北平一家。現在把它一一介紹在下面，以覩此項工業之成績：　　（上海八家）一心廠一心牌。雙輪廠雙輪牌。心心廠心心牌。天津廠天輪牌。日光公司第一牌。振宇廠葫蘆牌。家庭廠家庭牌。梁新記雙十牌。　　（天津二家）天生玉廠天壇牌。恒順廠星字牌。　　（北平一家）中國衛生牙刷廠衛字牌。　　估計以上各廠的總產額，每月約有七八十萬支。以與人口數比較相差很遠。但近來各廠鑒於巿塲之下景氣，銷路之呆滯，大都趨向於减少生產之一途。　　至手工牙刷，因具相當之歷史，銷行亦廣，其產量較機製牙刷爲多。而舶來品於巿塲上，仍佔很大的勢力。英美德貨，製造固佳，但售價極昂，較之國貨，奚啻倍蓰。國人亟應打破崇拜洋貨之心理，以改購國貨。若日貨則每以雜牌，冒充我國國貨，混銷巿上。購者易受其欺。尤希愛用國貨者，注意及之。參觀筆記寳山紙廠參觀記  胡叙五　　八字橋之役，爲一二八戰史中重要一頁，其間危墻斷壁，瑟縮於夕陽之下，回首當時，車馬喧　，令人心痛，乃有寳山紙廠者，危巢之一，碩果獨存，董亦牟矣。日昨傍晚，余以黃君佩章之介，倄黃君望平往觀，首謁廠長張君仁壽，張君鄞人，面　　，目炯炯有光，作工人裝，自言廠設於民國十七年，資本僅十餘萬，創建之初，即主廠事，自購置基地，建築廠屋起，至裝置機器，招工開車止，胥爲一手所經辦。數年以前，慘淡經營，所出紙張，頗爲社會所樂用，商務中華等大書局，且訂有長期合同，每日出貨，只感供不應求，不虞銷行疲滯，故從未在報章上登一營業告白。一二八之役，閘北居民，遠颺避禍，予（張君自稱）以本廠締造匪易，廠毁不啻身毁，因潛伏廠内，歷時月餘，厚邀天佑，廠固幸存，余亦無恙。妥恊初定，日軍猶未經盡撤，閘北一帶宛如死巿，予窮一畫夜之力，修葺電機，整理鍋爐，於是晝則突烟繚繞，夜則電炬閃耀，日人爲之驚奇不置，言次導往各部分參觀，若者爲機器間，若者爲電機間，若者爲材料間，井井不紊，張君載行載語，關於機器之改造，材料之配合，批郤導竅，如數家珍，同行黃君望平，固遂於機械學者，至此亦歎服異常。予等以廠基旣固出品亦精，因叩以曷不在滬設立事務所，以謀發展，張君慨然言曰，一二八戰後，不景氣籠罩全巿，本廠素採緊縮政策，即以予個人論，廠内管理，廠外接洽，以及化學上工程上之技術，在他廠非四五人不辦，在本廠則集予一身，故得於巿面蕭條同業傾軋中，勉强支持。今欲謀發展，必須招股，然而滬上金融界，投資地產者有人，投資實業者幾輩，招股旣無把握，則業務無從發展，業務旣無發展，則事務所之設立，徒使廠方加以一重消費耳，爲今之計，只有埋頭苦幹，有無辦法中謀一條出路而已。暢對旣畢，頷首而别，予以寳山紙廠爲「死裏逃生」之一國貨工廠，張君爲「置身死地而後生」之實業家，因記其事，爲之表彰，張君或不視爲佛頭着糞乎。國貨開篇  張夢飛　　今歲欣逢國貨年。國人愛國最爲先。華洋雜處春申地。商埠繁華孰並肩。每到明燈纔上候。街頭熱鬧接連牽。人們多喜外洋貨。弄得來國弱民貧實可憐。多少漏巵難計算。令人浩歎如熬煎。所以是國人提倡中華貨。國貨巿場設立徧。頻將文字去宣傳。最可恨一般人喜用東洋貨。寃仇不記便宜貪。他們是賺我金錢造槍砲。惡人心毒似砒般。望我同胞速警醒。切勿要如痴如醉似睡眠。倘得决心來抵制。臥薪嘗膽學勾踐。包管那倭奴一命赴黃泉。商業競爭今時代。任何花樣貴新鮮。應曉得經濟頻年侵略我。勝比武功幾萬千，從今後切勿用外洋貨。免得漏巵向外捐。勸君莫作口頭禪。　　張君夢飛。善編彈詞。近在大中華無線電台播送時事開　新頴精警。備受社會歡迎。國貨詩歌往國貨總庫購物  宵白　　在年紅燈照耀裏，我踏進了我們偉大的國貨總庫，一抬頭就瞥見可愛的花鳥在歡迎我這對莊嚴的銅獅也像微露着笑容。　　　　○　　○　　○　　　　金碧輝煌的商塲上，是滿佈着新頴的國貨，顧客在擁擠，店員在忙碌，這裏是滿呈着國貨的景氣。　　　　○　　○　　○　　我從北部再到南部，又參觀了一個九九商塲，一切的貨物確是便宜，我選擇了我需要的幾種，十分滿意地從裏面出來。國貨消息談國貨香皂藥皂  小玟　　五洲固本皂廠除主製家用皂外，還製有各種香皂藥皂，因爲這些出品都是採用間接方法製成的，在實用方面，得到很大的效騐！讓我現在把它分述在下面。　　香皂和洗衣皂有粗細的分别，製造的方法也稍有不同，因爲洗衣皂是注重去垢，香皂却是質香並重，巿上有各種的香皂：高價的洋貨，濫造的劣貨，…顧客常便在馬虎的情形下吃了虧，所以選擇香皂的必要條件是：香氣馥郁，質料精細，價値經濟，國貨固本香皂，完全具有上述的條件，它現在出有美女，蘭花玫瑰，檀香，月桂，…等幾十種，都是眞美善的國貨得香皂。　　藥皂和香皂性質又有點兩樣，它是最有益於皮膚的，譬如一個人皮膚有病，就要影響他的美觀，而藥皂却能補人們的這種缺欠。從前藥皂只有舶來品，後來我國人了能自造，而且五洲精製的藥皂，並汪在舶來品之下，固本藥皂計分中華衛生藥皂，蜜蜂鐵盒藥皂，紅色衛生藥皂，綠色克得沙皂，…等幾十種。常用沐浴洗滌，可以免除一切的皮膚病並且可以使皮膚走到康健美的途徑。　　福建省政府爲發展工商提倡國貨起見，特發起國貨展覧會，擇定福州西湖公園爲會址，定期本年雙十節開幕。前日上海巿會商品陳列所接該展覧會來函！請代徴集滬埠出品，運閩陳列，以壯觀瞻。該所現已函復該會籌備處准代徴集云。　　上海四團體，前此舉辦之國產綢緞展覧會，規模偉大，出品富麗，哄傳全國，湖南省國貨陳列館，曾派代表，蒞會參觀，非常滿意，嗣函請上海巿商會陳列所代表向各廠徴集小樣品，運湘陳列，以資提倡。啟事　　本刋以篇幅有限，取稿務求精簡切實之文字，凡超過五百字以外之長稿，苦無發表機會，敬希投稿諸君注意是幸。　　　　　申報國貨週刋部啟</p>

<p>自由談蛀蟲與中國  豈凡　　蛀蟲和我們中國人緣分特别好。一隻鮮紅可愛紅裏泛白同少女嬌艷的臉旦一般的水蜜桃，剝凈了皮，一口咬下，便現出了一個充滿褐沙的窪，其中滿身紅潤，肥碩健美的蛀蟲，像突然爱驚而在扭身打滾。仔細察看，桃子上是有着細小穴道的進路，但粗看外表誰也不會想到這裏面培養着這個寳貨的。　　常言道，十桃九蛀，桃子裏生蛀蟲，至多只能令我不敢吃桃子罷了，恨也没有什麽可恨，怪也没有什麽可怪的。但誰説限於桃了呢？在中國所有的菓物中，都免不出受蛀蟲的侵害，除非像梅子那麽趕早結實，趁氣候還一容蛀蟲誕生，此外如李如杏乃至枇杷楊梅荔枝，一直要到冬天，不容蛀蟲再活時的橘子，才免於難，　　不限於鮮菓，一切乾藏的食物中，蛀蟲都侵害到，南北雜貨舖中去一看，你就可明白我們是怎樣只吃得些蛀餘了。乾藏的菓類，稱爲滋補强身的如荔枝龍眼胡桃棗子之類，都是蛀蟲的大本營，由此出發，把棧房裏所堆存的貨品都蛀到，不論是金華火腿東洋魚翅乃至燕窩海參按時茶食，只要牠爬得到，便是拖安身之所，安身得住，自然因爲可以蛀食。　　　　　不但在南北雜貨舖子裏，我們每家的廚房裏，也有不少蛀蟲。第一，我們日常所食用的大米麵粉中，蛀蟲决不缺少，卽使我們並未發見，但存在是無疑的，不信你到糧食店中去看來，没有一家糧食店不豢養着許多蛀蟲的。　　不必再多舉具體的例了，中國我蛀是確定的事實，而中國的所以多蛀蟲，是中國人愛好蛀蟲之故，至少是和蛀蟲有好緣分。農藝上的除蟲技術，因西方農業科學之發達而竣於完成，他們的蔬菓之類，很少受蟲害的，而我們的青菜葉上一定要留着若干條小青蟲，説起來我們也曾着力考究過西方的農藝之學的了。　　除了我們和蛀蟲有緣分之外，没有方法可以説明的，而我們所以和蛀蟲有緣分，就因爲我們眞像那些蛀蟲，我們多數的中國人，還是崇拜羨慕那些不勞而食撥肥而噬的蛀蟲式的人。我想，倘要中國復興，第一應先去蛀蟲，而把崇拜羨慕的觀念改變過。辭工  老舍　　您是没見過老田，萬幸，他能無緣無故的把人氣死。就拿昨天説吧。昨天是星期六，照例他休息半天。吃過了午飯，刷刷的下起小雨。老田進來了：『先生，打算跟您請長假。』爲什麽呢？『您看，今天該我歇半天，偏偏下雨。』　　『我並没呌誰下雨呀，』我説　　『可是您呌我星期六休息，』他説　　『今天出不去，不會明天再補上嗎？』我説　　『今天是今天，明天是明天：今天我怎辦？』他説。　　『你上吊去。』我説。　　『在哪兒上？』他説。　　幸而二姐來了，把這塲給解説開了，我指給他一條路，呌他去睡覺。　　我不知道他睡着没有，不大一會兒他又進來了：『先生，打算跟您請長假。』　　『又怎麽啦？』我説　　『您看，我剛要睡着，小球過來聞我的鼻子，』他説。　　『我没讓小球聞你的鼻子，』我説　　『可是您呌我睡覺，』他説　　『不愛睡就不用睡呀，』我説。　　『大下雨的天，不睡幹什麽？』他説。　　『我没求龍王爺下雨啊，』我説。　　『可是您呌我星期六休息，』他説　　『好吧，你要走就走吧，給你兩個月的工錢，』我説。　　『您還得多賞點，外邊還有點零碎的賬，』他説。　　『有五塊錢夠不夠？』我説。　　『夠了，』他説。　　他拿着錢出去了。　　雨越下越小了，南邊的天有裂開的樣子。　　老田抱着小球在房簷下站着，站的工夫大了，我始終没答理他。他跟小球説開了：『小乖球，小白球，找先生去吧？』　　我知道他是要進來找我。果然他搭訕着進來了。　　『先生，天快晴了，我還是出去一趟吧，』他説。　　『不請長假了？』我説。　　他假裝没聽見。『先生，那五塊錢我先拿着吧，家裏今年麥秋收的不好。』　　『那天你不是説麥子收得很好嗎？』我説。　　『那，我説的是别人家的麥子，』他説。　　『好吧，去吧：回來的時候給我帶幾個好桃兒來，』我説。　　『這幾天没好桃，』他説。　　『』你假裝的給我找一找，找送著就買，找不到拉倒，』我説。　　『好吧，』他説，走了出去。　　到夜裏十一點，我睡了，他纔回來。　　『先生，給您桃兒，直找了半夜纔找着這麽幾個好的。』　　『先放着吧；我説，蹦蹦戲什麽時候散的？』我問。　　『剛散，』他説。　　『你怎么聽完戲又找了半夜的桃呢？』我説。　　『那，我看見别人剛從戲棚裏出來，』他説。　　今天早晨起來。老田一趟八趟的往外跑，好像等着什麽要緊的信或是消息似的。　　『老田，給我買來的桃呢？』我問。　　『我這不是直給您在外邊看着嗎，等有好的過來給您買幾個，』他説。　　『那麽昨晚上您没買來？』我説。　　『昨晚上您不是睡了嗎？』早晨買剛下樹的多麽好！』他説。　　故事還多着呢，等我有工夫再給您説。一個抗議  曹聚仁　　古來想像力豐富的色情狂文人，女人的乳房最爲生花妙筆所愛點染。雞頭新剝，盈握温韾，於是神魂飛越，想入非非矣！近年來由束胸解放而爲天乳，愈可以助色情文人之想像。而美不雙全，乳房雖足以助商品之推銷，可奈天乳有五種之多，合標準的只有一種，不合標準的只好裝乳托，無從裝乳托的，只好裝假乳。我們看好們孤心苦詣，從乳房上做文章，然爲推銷商品計，亦尚情有可原。　　然而摩登女郎的乳房新論出來了，一位女明星公告同好，説是要保護乳房的美麗，第一要不喂養嬰兒。據説這　新論，極得摩登女郎們的喝彩。我雖不是淑種學專家，這位明星所投的黑影，却令人毛髮竦然！乳房助色情狂文人的想像，替摩登女郎推銷商品，只能説是副作用；其正作用應該是喂養下一代嬰兒。所謂新時代女性，手裏牽着哈巴狗在街上往來，把自己的兒女交托給奶媽：親自替哈吧狗洗澡喂肉，把兒女讓丫頭老媽子去管敎：這種純利己的享樂公式，不知爲社劊造了多少惡因。若再提倡不喂乳的保全乳房美質論，下一代嬰孩將爲這些貓頭鷹所咬盡吃光，將來的社會還堪設想嗎？　　所謂婦女運動，提倡了差不多一二十年，其結果資本主義的一切光明幸福全未得到，資本主義的一應黑暗災禍，都已來臨。上海小巿民中，所謂學校皇后，所謂交際明星，所謂摩登女郎，所謂美趣花瓶，徹頭徹尾都是一種享樂主義者。藉口經濟困難，動輒打胎；而染脚指甲的蔲丹，花一二十金不恤也；兒女敎育費，較量錙銖，而一夜的麻雀，輸三五百金，又滿不在乎；某明星的乳房新論，也不過這種享樂意識無意中流露出來。然而下一代的嬰孩並不是屬於這些享樂主幾的摩登女郎的，我們有權提出抗議；誰要呑没下一代的嬰乳，我們就用最黑最黑的咒語詛她們死亡！　　其實，目前已需要一個更廣大的婦女運動了！天堂與地獄  裘　　「朱門酒肉臭，途有餓死骨」。在這世界上，一部份的人是在天堂裏，天天過着飽食醉酒，奢侈淫樂的生活；百另一部份人却囚在地獄裏，啼飢號寒，輾轉啤吟。這中間，就有着天堂與地獄的分界。|一條不容飛越的鴻溝。那在天堂裏的，他們從不願意去一聽那在自己脚下的地獄裏的哭聲，在地獄裏的，也就不敢想去知道那建築在自己頭上的，　究竟是怎樣一個夢想不到的奢華的天堂。一直，這兩種人把一切都歸之於「命運」，一方面以爲自己是天賦有這權利到天堂來享樂，另一方面也就以爲命中注定該落地獄吃苦。因此，享樂的是任性的享樂，吃苦的却也儘是低着頭吃苦，無論是人上人，或是人下狗，天堂地獄，各不相犯。「命運」這東西潛伏在人們心裏維持了一個長時期的太平。　　但如今，這所謂「命運」已漸漸的在人們心裏動搖了。一樣的「人」爲什麽有些是勞苦終日不得一飽，而另一部份却飽食醉酒，終日無所事事呢？是誰在供養着那些天堂裏的人們呢？那不正是地獄裏的人們嗎？一想到這，地獄裏的人便覺着不平，而從前的低泣和呻吟，漸漸地變成疾呼和怒吼了。　　住在天堂裏的人，對於從地獄發出來的這樣的疾呼怒吼，是不是永遠可以不聞不問呢？生命與機械（七）（完）  孫泱　　誰呌你昨兒衣裏找了一個白虎？」阿發哈哈地笑了。　　金生靜靜地站着抓頭髮，兩隻眼斜視着天，彷彿在打什麽主意。猛一回頭，瞧見阿松和小方正站在後面；便皺皺眉，大聲説：「過來」！　　兩個人便走上前幾步。　　「把他翻過來！」傲然地用手指着躺在那兒的身軀。阿松躊躇着，小方的眼睛裏却含着涙珠，舊的憤怒在他的心底烟一般地散了，新的憤怒却增加起來。　　「快點！」　　阿松彎下腰，把那個身軀一扳，但是攤開的臂膀却阻止了這個舉動。阿松只得用强壯的手腕箍着黑細的腰，把那個身軀舉起來。一股難聞的腥氣突然鑽進了他的鼻孔，連忙雙臂一翻，把它仰擲在地板上，自己形快退後一步，揉鼻子。　　那個身軀一點也没有改變式樣：兩手攤開，左腿筆直，右腿微曲。頭髮蓬亂着，在腦頂心和耳際一樣地全有寸來長。慘黃的臉，一隻眼緊開着，另一隻却是半開的，露出汉有神的瞳人，乾魚似地望着天。一道凝結了的血塊掛在右邊脚角上。　　一個渾身武裝的巡捕，腦門上冒着汗走來，望着死屍瞪瞪眼兒，回頭向四個人望望，説：　　「像煞癆病。」阿發陪着笑臉。　　巡捕從懷裏拿出一本袖袗簿子，一管鉛筆，寫上幾個字，糊塗地去了。　　小方眼裏的涙珠差不多要滾下來了，他拉着阿松走到另一面的欄杆上坐着。他不説話，只是望着睛朗的天。天是蔚藍的，那對大眼珠兒却是血紅的。　　「什麽事？」阿松驚疑地問。　　江面駛大萊公司的紅烟囱小輪。江風帶着汽笛聲飄來，算是回答。　　「什麽事呀？小方！」　　涙珠從孩子的眼裏滾下來，他指着那殭硬的屍體，用哽咽的調子低聲説：　　「昨兒夜裏要欺負我的，就是他。」　　　四　　　　當土紅色的輪船再靠碼頭的時候，大夥兒又像機械似地更在肌肉裏添加着疲勞的毒素。各種病菌大污濁的空氣裏任意侵蝕着大夥兒的肉體。於是，無數的苦力這樣死去。然而大批的生命的機正從鄉村流到都巿來，生命雖泥一般被踐踏着，機械總不會缺乏。</p>

<p>談言難僑呀！到那裏去呢？　　一提起華僑，似乎就很容易聯想到「发洋財」一條路上去；雖然未必個個華僑盡成資本家，也不能一筆抹煞。連鐘牌橡皮鞋，虎標八卦丹之類，誰不是華僑中大公司的出品。　　就是不發洋財，能在外國鬼混，總値得惹人眼紅的。黨國元老中有人從前説過寗到外國去流爲乞丐的話。的確，外國比本國好，否則，要人們下野决不會有一定的公式，出洋游歷的。　　話又説回來了，美中也有不足，就是祖國不掙氣，僑民要坍　，隨即侮辱就跟着來了。來了怎麽辦呢？惟一的辦法，去向居留地的本國公使館或領事署求援。聽説事情不妙，有「求」不「應」，「應」亦不「靈」。「弱國無外交」，還去説牠作甚？額角太低，自認晦氣。　　殺了敎士，鬧成八國聯軍；燒掉鴉片，馬上打到南京；爲了「大佐」「和尚」，不惜興師問罪，侵略四行省，毁滅大上海·····這些窮凶極惡的保僑行動，是外國的覇道，我國禮讓爲國，當然不肯也不屑那樣蠻幹的。就是安分守己，循規蹈矩，好好地住在國内的馴良土著，也還洋兵一到，性命難保，何况遠隔重洋，寄寓在外國的華僑呢？　　不過華僑倒不忘懷祖國，祇看每逢國内有事僑胞踴躍輸將，其愛國熱忱，已可想見。國内有人辦學校，設立孤兒院，及建築紀念物等等，也去向他們募捐；甚至冒牌去騙錢的，也大有其人。　　這個年頭兒，世界大起動搖，各國都大鬧其不景氣，大搶其白麵包；結果，華僑縱能含辱忍垢，也是立足無地，被排斥得失業，流落，儘管洋領事否認，最雄辯的事實，到底層出不窮。　　旅墨難僑第十四批都抵滬了。日本方面也來了好幾批，長崎四鄉，還有許多欲歸不得。上海巿商會的電報上説，挪威僅有華僑半打，也還奈他們不得。倘或各國起而效尤，那末華僑來日大難，如何是好。　　眼看着一批一批的難僑從國外被逼回來；環顧國内呢，又「淞滬戰」，「華北戰區」，「農村破產」，「匪區難民」，一片救濟聲，鬧得頭昏眼暗，「怎麽得了。」　　國外如彼，國内如此，難僑呀！到那裏去呢？熱白菓  笠笠　　「烫手糯米熱白菓，　　香是香來糯是糯；　　　白菓要吃鵝蛋大　　一個銅板買三個　　若要多，二個銅板買七個」。　　這抑揚頓挫歌詞化的呼聲，跟着秋風，驅逐了「要不？西瓜。」「凉陰啊買冰啊！」的呼聲，占領了上海空氣。　　一副簡陋的担子：二只竹簍，一根扁担。前面竹簍上鋪一塊板，板上是一副小風爐鍋子，一把大蛤蜊殼的剷刀，一只微黃的白布袋，滿滿的裝着熱白菓，一股氤氳的熱氣，薰蒸得白布袋灼手可熱。後面竹簍中是十數根指兒粗的木柴，和一面盆生的給水滋潤着的白菓。　　這抑揚頓挫歌詞化的呼聲一起，那副簡陋的担子已平放地上，一陣「嘩啦，嘩啦」蛤唎殼和鐵鍋繫撞聲，和白菓受不住煎熬，而呻吟呼號的剝拍聲，組織成激昂慷慨的交響樂。這充滿誘惑性的呼聲響聲，激發我平靜的心靈，砰然而動，不自主的踏出門口，全罄嚢中銅元，雙手捧了一堆鵝蛋大（？）的熱白菓，入内大嚼。　　據白髮的外祖母説，三十年前的白菓，一錢可買三個，現在十文錢買三個，這相差十倍的價値演進中，包含了多少歷史的變遷！經濟的潰敗，農村的破產，工商業之不發達，天災人禍，外侮内亂，以致百物飛騰，民不聊生····最近三十年來受帝國主義的操縱脅迫而成的不景氣，却在小小的白菓價値演進中表現着。　　平心而論，熱白菓的味兒不十分美，略帶苦味；但清香軟糯，却非膩性的糖炒栗子所可比擬。　　秋的先鋒隊！熱白菓，不但先他物出世，且象徴着秋的一切。秋不是春的穠郁·夏的猛烈，冬的嚴肅，她是清澈的如白菓彀殼之潔白：緩和炎夏的氣候，如白菒肉的軟糯；深秋的肅殺，如白菓的略帶苦味。　　白菓上巿秋風起，這氣候的變遷，給人們多少苦味？荷花大少爲秋風起而感綢衫之寒不勝衣，窮措大爲秋風起而愁寒衣之久困囵圄（當店），失業者爲秋風起而焦灼來日大難，招生開學的旗幟隨秋風而飄，失學諸生憂學費之無着，雁聲高吭隨秋風而鳴，天涯游子感神魂之黯消····這凄凉的白菓苦味的秋，啓示了人生們眞滋味|苦味。游戲文一張旅館的廣告  東林　　昨天經過××路，看見一張新貼旅館的廣告，從頭到尾讀了一遍，覺得好像將旅館應有的一切都包含在内，因此抄錄如下：　　自建房屋　九層洋樓　　摩登設備　迎合潮流　　房屋整潔　無有匹比　　洋磁浴室　格外道地　　特備大湯　任客揀選　　電扇水汀　冷氣熱氣　　中菜西菜　宴會富麗　　無線電話　播佈消遣　　花園舞廳　隨客游憇　　電梯升降　便客上起　　車站輪埠　備車迎接　　茶房侍役　呼應敏捷　　房間價目　特别克己　　各界光顧　五體投地露天旅館顯禮　　離開了白鴿籠，倦着一張舊蓆和爛而骯髒的棉被，走到那露天的旅館去！！馬路旁的行人道。　　這裏不需旅費，只要捷足先登，就可得着極好的地位：可是後來者，只好望洋興嘆！　　没有木虱和蚤：只有微和的晚風。蚊小姐也不常肯來光顧，她們好像體恤</p>

<p>窮人似的。　　在黑暗處。遭夜游的摩登小姐們誤踢了一兩脚。雖然痛了，那敢出聲：隨着還接受淸脆的駡聲：「猪　」。　　　洋大人的火腿，也不時享受的可是日久慣了，也不覺得什麽。　　仰頭望着天空閃閃爍爍的小星，白晃晃的明月，還有倐忽亂竄的流星，多麽清逸快意。　　夜深了，只聽見鼾鼾的鼻聲，和着習習的凉風，晶熒熒的露水，漫慢地落下來，好像喝了杯冰凍汽水，通身凉爽。　　啊！這裏眞是窮人的安樂窟！理髪  一蘋　　早上梳洗時，見鏡子裏的人影頭髪太長了，一個輕輕的念頭在心上滾過去「下午理髪去。」到了下午，並不見得有怎樣忙的事幹，早已把鏡中瞧見的鬆鬆然底頭髪忘了；縱然也有牢記着的時候，自己一定推諉着想「明天去罷，要枯坐一個多鐘頭哩，到明天頭髪也長不了許多。」然而明天還是明天，一天一天挨着。直到自己覺得在人面前太難爲情了，望見人家滑滑的，光光的，尤其怕聽「小張的是藝術家的風度啊！」自己明知不懂藝術，而硬送上一個藝術家的頭銜，顯見他們對我的頭髪説話了，於是悄悄地到理髪館去。　　許多人對於理髪往往認定一家，自己從前也是這樣，後來常常搬家，化了車錢趕到老店去理髪，似乎太不上算，所以一見理髮館的招牌就進去了、倒底吃了一欠虧。　　上星期是我朋友的婚期’吃喜酒雖然比不得做新官人、理一次髮却不能缺少，可是我的頭髮還在明天後天的挨日子。到那天早上。我自以爲不理髮也能去吃喜酒的，就約略將鬆鬆然的頭髮用木梳整理一下，等另一個朋友來一同到××旅館去。朋友的頭髮不但整齊得劃分爲二，還捲曲的像獅子狗的毛，不過比我的「毛」却有「美觀」與「難看」之分。當時除被他駡一句「懶狗」之外，硬推我到附近的理髮館去，還説你没錢我有，在西裝袋裏掏出四毛錢，但是終究仍放進他自己的袋裏，我不禁苦笑着去挨一點鐘的罪。　　那家理髮館規模雖不大，也分了樓上樓下，我進去的時候，下面的五個位子，已被捷「頭」先登了。樓上是女客座，我是個道地的男子，心想今天這顆藝術家的頭，終於要在新倌人面前獻醜了，那個穿白布西裝褲的，我以爲是老闆，灣着腰笑顏逐開的説「先生，樓上請」，一請把我請到樓梯底下，我不得不舉步登梯了。　　樓上的一切，裝置，設備，即使理髮師的臉袋兒，也比樓下漂亮，當然我的理想之中，他們的技術也高人一等。今天的頭，不能與獅子狗一較上下，也可少受幾句「小張的是藝術家的風度啊！」的所謂幽默話。　　比我先在的是兩位光了腿的Ｍｉｓｓ，正前後照着鏡子告訴理髮師怎樣剪裁。我也在第三個位子上安坐下來，一位理髮師過來照例圍上一塊綢，就舉上鉗子剪下許多短髮，叁概最多五分鐘吧？他推過一面到地的長鏡子，給我照照後面的頭髮，我見鬆鬆然的還是一大堆，我想這犧牲太大了，三五天又被駡做藝術家那不是玩的，就吩咐他剪薄一點，他的回答却出我意料之外，「剪薄了要短的啊！」我不信上海時髦長頭髮嗎，又爲什麽我長了頭髮被人家惡意的駡做藝術家？看那理髮師的嘴臉却像我不懂事似的。「短就短啊！」終於想到藝術家三個字的罪　，管他媽的喊他剪短。頭髪是剪短了，不過在後面被人家發現了三處刀痕，這不能怪理髪師，他的技術是那樣地高明竟不及我預料中的一半受罪，從踏進理髮館到回家一共不及二十五分鐘，三處刀痕有什麽關係呢，少坐半點鐘罪哩，然而不識趣的朋友看了我的頭説，「還是不剪的好」我眞不知道他是善意還是惡意。　　寫到這裏，還多二行空紙，我就乘便告訴讀者，那天比我先在的兩位光腿Ｍｉｓｓ，在我付四毛錢的時候，他們還没有動剪刀，這樣坐下去受罪，不要命嗎？想想駡一句藝術家倒不見得是多大的損失。現代名人書畫　　朱鏡波先生松朱鏡波先生吳縣人喜　事爲嵩山草堂入室　高弟寫生頗得生動活潑趣之店員通訊没有愛的結合　　編者先生：　　在報端時見先生爲社會人士，代解疑問，指示大道，精密詳細，深爲欽佩。茲者，鄙人有一難題，懇先生代爲解釋；現將事實略述於後：鄙人年二十三歲，服務商界多年。三年前，在友人家，結識友妹某女士。她今年十九歲；鄙人因店務關係，與她家往返甚密。然她爲人幽默，况處舊家庭中，故鄙人雖屬意於她，而不能出口。去年底返寗地家中，家嚴見我長大成人，逼令與本城某姓女訂婚。鄙人雖不滿意，因嚴命難違，竟亦默許。今春她（指友妹）因年齡關係，與環境感化，竟改去幽默而與余親密：漸生愛苗，邇來竟達極點。在她大有非我莫嫁之勢，在我亦有非她莫娶之意。故愚意欲與某姓女解除婚約，好在尚未結婚，但有疑問數則錄後，乞先生指示，不勝感謝。　　）一）我與對方解除婚約，應用何種理由。　　（二）倘我進行解除婚約，是否有傷人格與名譽？　　（三）對方是否有理由訴法律？　　（四）倘對方堅决不容解約，或謂理由不充足，應用何種步驟，達到目的？如解約旣成，是否有賠對方損失之責？　　（五）因對方乃舊家庭，倘我解除婚約，與彼之家庭以及她的本身，是否有發生重大響影之可能？　　（六）我意命人在寗地僞稱本人在申品行不端，人格墮落等詞，使對方聞之，樂於解約：此計可否可用？再者，此事即須解决，故乞先生拔號先復，如寳貴的篇幅無暇，則請函復。　　周盛華鞠躬　　編者按：男女之間，没有愛的結合，始終是危險的；牠的結果，不是抱恨終天，便是有始無終。當三年前，周君旣鍾情於某女士，那麽最光明最正當的辦法，就是向她求婚；一個求訂婚的青年男子，有權利用正大光明的手段去向任何一個求訂婚的女子求婚。這種大方的求婚，即使在舊社會裏，也不會有人來禁止你，或者説你不對，充其量，不過掽壁而已。所以你當時的「不出口」實在是一種失策，也就是造成你目下困難的最大原因。　　那時你旣經因爲對方的冷淡和她的環境關係，而毅然自克；你就應該向其他方面追求，希中心的愛情，有所寄托。大不該採取消極手段，盲目地答應與另一個彼此毫無愛情的女子訂婚。這種婚約，因爲曾經你自己同意，所以在法律上是成立的。同時因爲彼此之間，根本没有認識，没有情愫，所以很有發生動搖的可能。以致陷於目下的困難。　　我們旣經知道目下的困難，是發生於以前錯誤，那麽現在的問題，就集中在「還是應當將錯就錯呢？還是及早回頭呢？」將錯就錯的結果，不免要弄到抱恨終生，或者説不定以後終究免不了一個决裂。及早回頭，眼前當然要準備受一些物質上的損失，和精神上的不安，但是究屬因爲還没有結婚的緣故，這創痕也許不至於十分的深刻。基上原則，所以我們贊成你現在祇有硬着頭皮，辦理解約的手續。照民法規定，婚約無論如何，不能强迫覆行；換句話説，婚約的雙方當事人，在没有結婚之前，都有提出請求解除的權利，不過同法規定無過失的一方可以向提議解約的一方提出損害賠償而已。在對於你這個問題，有了上面大體上的慨念以後，現在再來答復你的問題罷！　　（一）你向對於提出解約，除了説「我倆旣根本没有愛情，還是乾脆地解了約，比較有利於雙方」以外，絶對没有理由。　　（二）你這種舉動的錯誤，不過可以證明你意志的薄弱；與你的人格和名譽，絶對没有影響。　　（三）對方當然可以向法院自訴，要求一切物質上和精神上的損害賠償。　　（四）你也可以用「彼此根本没有愛情」的簡單理由，申請法院宣告婚約無效；不過你得準備相當的損害賠償而已。　　（五）當然她和她的家屬，會因此而受此劇烈的損害（精神上），但是你一想到不解約的結果，或者會比此更甚的時候，也就可以毅然實行了。　　（六）用手段和作僞是不應該的，何况對於一個我已經良心上對不起她的她呢。這層，你斷乎不可實行。自我職業介紹　　|凡回音欲由本報業餘周刋轉者以後務請開示通信處|　　|上欄來稿，因積存甚多，暫時停收|　　陳女士，二十三歲，某大學文科畢業，對於文學頗感興趣，願任雜誌或兒童讀物編輯，機關圖書館或大學職員，欲聘者請函本埠吳淞路四三八弄克儉里十一號陳素貞女士轉，　　某君，浙江鄞縣人，年二十四歲，擅長化學，初等代數。平面幾何，曾任中學敎員，現願任私家敎師，酬金不計，欲聘者，請逕函貝締鏖路，桃園里五號周炳榮君轉。戲劇戰爭與和平（七）  凌鶴　　第一幕　生與死　　傷兵甲：那怎麽成？誰不是重傷，誰知道還能夠捱過今天晚上麽？　　軍醫：這是什麽話呢？像你就是輕傷的，你就可以等着明天回去。　　傷兵甲：那末軍醫老爺，你可以担保我今天晚上不死麽？　　軍醫：呸！放屁！我担保你今晚不死。我還要担保你今生今世不死哩。　　傷兵甲：我不要你提保我這一世，假如你現在不要我去的話，我祇要你担保今天一晚。　　軍醫：不准説，住口！你再要强辯我打你！　　中年乙：好了，好了，别再説了罷，今夜你就在這破廟裏住一晚罷。　　　傷兵甲：要打嗎？你來打好了，你是長官，是軍醫老爺，我不過是一個小兵，算得什麽呢？反正我現在打傷了，是一個廢人，不能到前綫打仗，對於你們當然没有用了。可是你等着罷，等我病好了以後，看我怕不怕你？　　　傷兵本丁：你媽的，擺什麼架子呀？不過是一個小軍醫官！哼。誰怕你呀？　　軍醫：（怒不可遏的走過去踢他）「造」你媽的，不怕我嗎？（傷兵甲丁實行反抗，以石子擲他。鄕人爭着解勸。但大家都很氣忿。軍醫知道衆怒難犯，且怒且駡的退下。）　　軍醫：（向台下走去！咱們開車去，讓他們在這裏死罷。（引擎聲，車開去，傷兵們的呼喊。）　　傷兵甲：（諸位老鄕！你們看罷。我們當兵的簡直不是人呀！在他們眼中我們都不過是一羣戰馬或者是一些警犬，　死也好，活也好，反正不關他們的事。譬如這次打日本，爲了東北的老鄕，我們誰不是不顧生死的拚命。但是不怕我們怎樣肉搏，終於敵不過飛機，大砲，坦克車，我們早就預料到，我們總有一次會受傷，會蹺辮子。可是我們受傷了會有好好的診治嗎？諸位看得很明白。···（大聲）長官門是不會給我們打算的。我們傷了，我們病死，在他們不是像抛了一隻破草鞋似的將我們丢在這裏不管了嗎？　　傷兵丁：可是他們也有理由說的。他們說後方民衆不援助我們，沒有錢買藥品。所以······　　傷兵甲：這也是騙人的話，我們排長不是説過，南邊的老百姓就捐了不少錢給我們史弟，可是這些錢到那裏去了呢？我們爲什麽連醫藥費也没有了呢？　　老者：我看兩位老總還是到廟裏去休息休息吧。這些話説也無用。自古道：「只有老爺説的，没有小的説的，」所以二位還是放大量一點兒罷。　　老婦：可是像這樣的破廟，怎麽好睡覺呢？床也没有一張的。　　中年甲：我去弄一些稻草來罷，有了稻草在地下也可以將就睡睡的。　　傷兵丁：哦！原來這廟裏没有人的嗎？　　中年乙：這個廟嗎？以前到是挺熱鬧的，自從去年扎過一營兵，一些板壁房門全給那些大爺們燒光了。那個守廟的老和尚也給他們嚇跑了。一直到現在，廟也不能住人，而且也没人住。你看連大門也没有了，敎人怎麽住呢！······</p>

        <h1>1933.08.24</h1>
<h3>Sun Tonggang Inspects Disaster Area by Airplane</h3>
<p>(Jinan) At 9 a.m. this morning, Sun Tonggang, on Han's orders, took a plane to western Shandong to inspect the flood, accompanied by He Siyuan, the head of the Department of Education. They returned to Jinan at 1 p.m. According to their account, after taking off, they flew west along the Yellow River and saw that Shouzhang, Fanxian, and Puxian counties on the north bank were all a vast expanse of water. Villages and fields were completely submerged, with only the tips of trees visible. Flying from Puxian to the south bank of Henan, they saw that Juancheng and Heze were completely submerged. Water was also visible in the southwestern part of Yuncheng, the northern part of Juye, and the western part of Jiaxiang. Boats were navigating on land in Heze and Juancheng. The Jinan-Ning to Heze highway only had the treetops on both sides visible, having become a waterway. The three cities of Ju, He, and Juan were surrounded by water. It is estimated that 5,000 villages and 2 million people are submerged. Heze County alone has 400,000 people. The plane circled Heze several times, dropping leaflets urgently prepared by the provincial government for relief and dike plugging. The people jumped for joy to welcome them. Sun and He decided to fly to Dingtao, Caoxian, Shanxian, and Chengwu again for inspection on the 24th. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Fanxian telegraphed that three-fifths of the county's land, over 3,000 hectares, has been flooded, and the water in Dong'a has reached the city gate. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, Han telegraphed Chiang and Wang, briefly stating that after investigating, over ten counties in western Shandong are entirely a watery realm, continuing to overflow eastward, and the disaster area is expanding daily. Dong'a County also reported flooding, with mournful cries heard everywhere, and no bedding or clothing. Although ordered by the Jun Yuan to allocate surplus funds from the Yangtze River flood control, it has not yet been received. The government is doing its utmost to raise funds, but it's like a drop in the bucket. With the Junzuo suffering from illness, he is implored to consider the starvation and drowning of millions of people, and order the allocation of 2 million yuan from the proceeds of selling American wheat to relieve the flood and save lives. The telegram is filled with urgency and awaits orders. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Sun Tonggang also stated that from the plane, hundreds of miles were connected by water and sky. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Today, the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River are still rising. Luokou rose by two centimeters, with a water level of 31.08 meters. Damajia rose by 4.5 centimeters, with a water level of 15.02 meters. In the Qihe area on the north bank, residents are sleeping in the open every night on the embankment. For dozens of miles along the river, lights illuminate the night, and voices are clamorous. The river channel is too narrow in the lower reaches. If it rises again, Huimin in the north bank, the territory of Lvjia Li, and the territory of Putai on the south bank of Damajia will inevitably be flooded. Currently, straw, stones, willow branches, and sacks are being used to reinforce the low points of the dikes. Subsidiary embankments are being built everywhere. The most worrying thing is that in Qihe and Changqing on the north bank, the water has only risen and not receded for days. Over time, the dikes will be difficult to maintain. Director Zhang Lianjia of the River Bureau left early in the morning to avoid the danger of the dikes collapsing, and went to the lower reaches. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) In the territory of Putai on the south bank of the lower reaches of the Yellow River, four sections of Daoxu Valley are overflowing. In the territory of Lijin, six sections of Damajia Valley on the north bank have the same water level. The water level has dropped in the upstream area of Fanxian. In the middle reaches, Luokou dropped 1.2 meters tonight, with a water level of 21 meters. In the lower reaches, Dama Huanjia rose by four centimeters, with a water level of 15.3 meters. Puxian telegraphed that the Yellow River surrounds the city, civilian houses have collapsed, and food supplies have run out. Dingtao telegraphed that in Caoxian, the Yellow River's floodwaters and heavy rain poured down for six hours on the night of the 18th in the Po River area of the southern district of the county, causing three breaches. Emergency repairs are underway. In Yang, the sixth district is flooded. The Yellow River water in Dong'a and Dongping counties continues to rise. Zhang Yue, Han's representative, returned to Jinan from Nanjing and said that Chiang and Wang are currently preparing relief efforts for the floods in this province. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Wang stated that the section of the Yellow River from the Yellow River Bridge in Henan to Shouzhang is entirely composed of sandy soil dikes that are prone to breaches. He plans to suggest digging a new river along the north bank of that section, straightening the bends. After the new river is dug, water will be diverted into it, constricting the water flow to scour away sediment. The excavated earth will be used to build a long dike, and a light railway can be built on the dike. The old riverbed is fertile and can be cultivated. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The General Staff's plane will return to Jinan today to measure the estuary of the Yellow River in the lower reaches and prepare a 1/10,000-scale map for reference. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Li Shuchun, the Director of the Civil Affairs Department, went to Changqing yesterday to inspect river works. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain Catholic priest in Henan telegraphed the relief association here, stating that 500 villages have been flooded, all crops have been destroyed, and 300,000 people are homeless. They have no food and only the clothes on their backs, urgently needing relief. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Tian Guangbi, the commissioner of the Administrative Commissioner's Office, returned to Xuzhou on the evening of the 22nd from Jiaxiang. According to him, the Yellow River in western Shandong has flooded, especially in Dongming, Heze, Dingtao, Caoxian, Chengwu, Yuncheng, and Juye counties, which are the most severely affected. It is a vast expanse of water, and homes have been completely destroyed. The breach in Dongming cannot be plugged, and the water splits into three streams. One stream heads towards the Canal via Wangke and Jining, one stream heads towards Weishan Lake via the Zhu River, Juye, and Jiaxiang, and one stream heads towards Zhaoyang Lake via the Wanfu River. The amount of water overflowing eastward will eventually converge and flow into Weishan Zhaoyang Lake and the Grand Canal. Once a massive flood merges, there is a risk of overflowing beyond the banks. Northern Jiangsu borders Weishan Lake and runs across the central canal. To avoid the disaster, it is essential that the Yellow River does not rise in the upper reaches, or that flood control is thorough. Otherwise, it is difficult to be optimistic about the future. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The Provincial Government received a telegram from Li Mingyang in Pei County, stating that the water situation in Caozhou is very serious. He is currently going to Zhaoyang Lake and the Dasha River Estuary to inspect the actual situation. The head of Pei County telegraphed that the Yellow River water has entered Zhaoyang Lake and is flowing downstream through Lanjiaba, endangering the counties along the Central Canal. In addition to leading the people to reinforce the dikes, he urgently requests that personnel be dispatched to block and build Lanjiaba. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Xu Kang, the Director of the Jiangbei Canal Works Bureau, went to Qingjiang on the morning of the 23rd to supervise the dike reinforcement works. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Wang Jingguo went to Wuyuan on the 21st to inspect the floods and supervise the work of military reclamation. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Yizhi, the chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, is scheduled to arrive in Nanjing on the 24th. President Wang is scheduled to meet with Li on the 25th to discuss the entire Yellow River project and funding issues. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Kai and others, dispatched by the Huai River Conservancy to Lanfeng to investigate the Yellow River flood, have now completed their task and returned to Nanjing. In addition to reporting the situation of the Yellow River breach, they also suggested to the authorities to quickly plug the breach and pay close attention to the Lianhe River dike works to avoid expanding the disaster area. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Yellow River Conservancy Commission stated that there are many sacks left over from the Yangtze River flood control effort, and telegraphed Zhou Xiangxian in Jiujiang, requesting that the sacks be concentrated in Jiujiang and dispatching staff member Tang Zhongping to transport them. Upon receiving a reply telegram to Nanjing, he will depart to transport the sacks to the various dike plugging projects. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Bridge is Still Not Safe</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A responsible person from the Ministry of Railways discussed the current situation of the Yellow River Railway Bridge, briefly stating that the bridge is a temporary bridge, over 30 years old. It originally had 102 spans, but was later destroyed by military bombings, leaving only 100 spans. Since the insurance period expired in 1920, heavy locomotives have been banned from crossing, and no less than hundreds of thousands of cubic meters of boulders have been dumped into the river every year. This year, the Yellow River has surged violently, and the bridge body is shaking. Within a few hours, the first to fifty-eighth spans have become silted shoals due to the rapid current. The scouring of the rapid current between the fifty-eighth and one hundredth spans has caused the stone embankment on the north bank to collapse completely. The piers of the fifty-eighth to eighty-second spans are all shaking. Fortunately, the water level has receded slightly, and the river channel has not shifted. However, the boulders dumped over the years have all been washed away by the water. With the autumn flood season approaching, it is still not safe. The remedial measure is to continue dumping boulders. Stones are currently being transported from Tangshan, Zhugezhuang, and other places to be thrown into the river. Passenger cars have been pushed across the bridge by manpower since the 20th. After a week, if the water level does not rise, each train can be pulled across the bridge by a small locomotive. The fundamental solution is to build a new bridge. When the bridge was first built, a fixed amount of funds was saved each year. By 1919, there were millions of dollars, plus 5 million US dollars, but it was all withdrawn and used by the Beijing government. Now, railway revenue has decreased significantly, making it impossible to save up. The bridge foundations can only be maintained for three to five years. Currently, the Railway Bureau is only carrying out construction for repairs. In addition, experts are being consulted, and the Ministry of Railways is also planning to raise 5 million to be used for bridge repairs. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Because the Yellow River Railway Bridge was damaged by the flood, with stone embankments collapsing and bridge piers shaking, posing a serious danger, the Ministry of Railways is planning to carry out construction for repairs and is also preparing a reconstruction plan. It plans to raise 5 million to rebuild the bridge. However, everything will have to wait until the water recedes before designs can be made. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>River Dike Collapses in Western Shanxi</h3>
<p>Baode, Liulin Area Becomes a Watery Realm</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the Baode and Liulin areas of western Shanxi in the upper reaches of the Yellow River, the dikes have collapsed, and hundreds of miles have become a watery realm. People have fled to the rooftops, but over 2,000 have been washed away by the turbid currents and drowned. Countless livestock have been lost. (23rd Electric Communications Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Pinghan Railway Resumes Scheduled Service</h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Pinghan train will resume its scheduled service starting on the 24th. It is reported that spans 50 to 90 of the Yellow River Bridge are being pushed by manpower in sections, and the remaining spans are being hauled by small locomotives. The bridge foundation has gradually become less dangerous after 20,000 pounds of stone were dumped. However, it is still difficult to carry heavy loads before repairs are completed. Also, the river water has receded, leaving a lot of silt, rendering cargo barges ineffective, and goods are stranded on both banks. The Railway Bureau's revenue has decreased by three-quarters in the past month compared to before. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Shanxi Circles Welcome Sun Dianying</h3>
<p>(Taiyuan) Various circles of the public held a welcome meeting for Sun Dianying at Zhongshan Park on the morning of the 23rd, with thousands of people attending.

At the end, they also shouted "Long live Sun Dianying's military reclamation starting point," with extremely enthusiastic slogans. After the meeting, they held a public banquet for Sun. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After Sun Dianying concentrated in Baotou, preparations were not properly made, making it difficult to travel west. The funding for his departure and the allowance in lieu of supplies for the 5th time in the ninth and tenth months had been approved by the Military Council and disbursed successively. It is reported that Sun telegraphed Ping from Taiyuan on the 22nd, stating that he still needed over 700,000 in funding and requested payment. However, North China's military expenses are extremely tight and cannot be arranged. The authorities had previously tried their best to accommodate Sun's aspirations to develop the Northwest, repeatedly acceding to his requests. Now, they have reached the end of their rope, and Sun's troops have not yet departed for Qinghai. It is still doubtful whether he will be able to reach his destination.

<h3>Song Zheyuan Sends People to Persuade Fang Ji's Troops</h3>
<p>Ji, Fang, and Other Troops Gather Around Zhangbei</p>
<p>Jiang Bocheng and Xiao Zhenying Will Go to Zhang Today</p>
<p>The 29th Army Headquarters Will Move to Zhangyuan</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed that the post-war arrangements for the various miscellaneous troops in Chahar Province could be decided within three days. There should be no problem with incorporating the troops of Sun Liangcheng and Zhang Yunrong. Of the supplies carried, 10,000 yuan has been issued to Tan Zixin's troops and 3,000 yuan to Li Zhongyi's troops, and 4,000 yuan to Sun Liangcheng's troops. Currently, the troops of Ji Hongchang, Fang Zhenwu, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Mutao, and Liu Guitang are all gathered in the six counties of Zhangbei. The puppet troops that invaded Duolun are still gathered there, showing no signs of advancing west. Jiang Bocheng and Hou Ying, a staff officer of the Military Council, will go to Chahar tomorrow afternoon. The method of reorganizing the miscellaneous troops in Chahar Province and the number of troops are still difficult to determine. In addition to the four troops of Tan Zixin, etc., that have been reorganized, the militias will still be returned to the people, allowing them to return home. Approximately 10,000 remaining troops that cannot be placed can be reorganized. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

In addition to the 100,000 yuan that Song has already taken with him, there is still 50,000 yuan in military expenses for Chahar Province, which is planned to be remitted from Beiping. As for the generals, Ji and Fang have telegraphed strong opposition, but their actual strength is only a few thousand men. After we arrive in Zhangyuan, we will do our best to negotiate. If they do not come to their senses, we will have to find other ways to resolve the situation. The other generals have all sent representatives to Zhang, requesting incorporation or demobilization, which should not be a problem. There are very few Japanese troops in the Duolun area, but quite a few puppet troops. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

Sun Liangcheng, Liu Guitang, and others are more peaceful. It is said that Fang Zhenwu is now raising the flag of Feng Yuxiang, who has already fallen, and calling himself the Acting Commander-in-Chief of the National Anti-Japanese Allied Army. However, Fang has recruited only about 4,000 soldiers, so he is not worth mentioning. (23rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song has sent people to persuade the three division commanders of Ji's troops, Zhang Lisheng, Zhang Lingyun, and Nie Yuling. Ji's troops actually number a little over 1,000 men.

<h3>Yin Tong Discusses the Situation of Taking Over the War Zone</h3>

Today, he received a telegram from Lushan, stating that Yu is scheduled to go down the mountain on the 23rd and take a boat to Nanjing, planning to travel north from Nanjing with Huang. Yu plans to stop briefly in Jinan before returning to Tianjin. The relocation of the Linyu County government back to Yuguan and the defense of the anti-Great Wall will have to wait until Huang returns to Beiping before proceeding with negotiations. Because the Central Government has made new decisions regarding Japan, negotiations have been temporarily suspended. Except for the five major passes along the Great Wall, such as Yuguan, Jielingkou, Lengkou, Xifengkou, and Gubeikou, which are still occupied by the Japanese army, there are still Japanese troops stationed in areas such as Jianchangying and Luoyang City inside Xifengkou, and Miyun and Luanzhou. After negotiations are initiated, there should be no problem with withdrawal. It has been decided that Yin Rugeng and Tao Shangming will serve as the administrative commissioners of the occupied area. Tao is responsible for the area east of Luan, with the commissioner's office located in Tangshan. Yin is responsible for the northern area, with the commissioner's office located in Miyun or Tongzhou. Huang is submitting the names of Yin and Tao to the Central Government for appointment, and an official announcement should be made soon. Yin Rugeng arrived in Tianjin last night and is going to Nanjing tonight. He will stay briefly before returning north.

<h3>The Japanese are Vigorously Implementing Economic Aggression in North China</h3>
<p>Organizing a Chamber of Commerce Federation</p>
<p>With Qingdao as the Headquarters</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the ceasefire in North China, Japanese goods have been actively promoted. Recently, when the issue of technical cooperation between the League of Nations and China arose, the Japanese side vigorously opposed it while actively implementing an economic group invasion of the North China market as the foundation for a concrete Japanese-Manchukuo-North China economic group. The economic group that invades North China is called the North China Chamber of Commerce Federation, which is an organized movement with its headquarters in Qingdao. Its area includes Tianjin, Beiping, Zhangyuan, Yuguan, and Shijiazhuang. Recently, Japan has added a commercial officer's sub-office in Qingdao, which is the initial step for this grand plan. According to the Tianjin Customs report, in terms of yarn, the total amount of Japanese goods imported into North China last month was 55 million tons. The rapid increase of other Japanese goods can be inferred from this. Currently, the most Japanese goods being imported are yarn, woolen textiles, paper, and children's toys. Hebei Province and Shanghai-Hankou goods have been greatly impacted. Japan's trade with China increased by approximately 5 million yuan last month. Currently, the market is flooded with Japanese goods. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Personnel from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Law See Off Luo Wengan</h3>
<p>Luo is Scheduled to Depart Tomorrow</p>

It is reported that Luo's departure preparations are complete. The Eurasia plane will fly from Shanghai to Nanjing on the 24th, and he is scheduled to fly into Xinjiang on the 25th. Luo told a reporter from the Central News Agency on the 23rd that when he returned to Nanjing via Shanghai, a certain reporter asked him whether the Central Government had changed its diplomatic policy. As he was about to go to Xinjiang and had many matters to attend to, he had no opinions on diplomatic policy to discuss with the press, so he did not answer. Now, a certain newspaper believes that his failure to answer means that he has tacitly agreed, which is very far-fetched. (23rd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gong Bicheng said that he has been assigned to go to Xinjiang to investigate the southern border. The area there is vast, transportation is inconvenient, and the government has instructed him to conduct a thorough investigation. Therefore, the time for their investigation will be extended, possibly lasting over a year, including travel time. They are currently preparing their luggage and will depart as soon as everything is ready. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Hong Kong) Since the Communist bandits from Changting and Tingzhou swarmed south, the anti-communist military situation in western Fujian has suddenly become tense. Southern Jiangxi, being adjacent to western Fujian, must also take precautions and intercept them.

The main content emphasizes aircraft reconnaissance and bombing to cover the army's advance and establish air stations in Longyan, Ganzhou, Meixian, and Dayu. Each station will dispatch an air squadron to be stationed, taking on anti-communist missions on each line at any time. Huang has designated the 3rd Squadron under Tao Zuode to be stationed in Dayu, the 2nd Squadron under Ding Jixu to be stationed in Ganzhou, the 4th Squadron under Xie Mang to be stationed in Longyan, and the 5th Squadron to remain stationed in Meixian, each responsible for anti-communist missions in western Fujian and southern Jiangxi. Currently, the 2nd Squadron has returned to the province in triumph from northern Guangdong. After a short rest, they will depart for Ganzhou. The 4th Squadron, originally scheduled to depart for Meixian during the day, will now change its course to Longyan once deployments are complete.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>No Need to Lose Heart</h3>
<p>Since the issue of the National Salvation Donation to Resist Japan arose, public opinion was in an uproar and people were indignant. Those who advocated for investigation said, "The people do not hesitate to shed sweat and blood, destroying their families and exhausting all their resources to relieve the national crisis and save the country, but instead, the people who handle the donations embezzle and misuse them. Then our people will hear about it and lose heart. Who will still be enthusiastic about saving the country?" And those who handled the donations said, "We do not avoid difficulties and hardships, running around and appealing to collect donations to help the anti-Japanese work. As a result, we are not only not understood but are suspected of embezzlement and division. Then, can those who are enthusiastic about saving the country in the future not hear about it and lose heart?" Both sides use losing heart as their argument, and both speak with reason. However, we believe that our people must not lose heart because of this. Since September 18th, the enthusiasm of our people to spontaneously help the anti-Japanese army has been an unprecedented phenomenon in any previous national crisis. Because the so-called destruction of families to relieve the crisis was only seen when floods and droughts were prevalent. As for enthusiastically donating to resist foreign aggression for the country, it is rarely seen in general. Therefore, although the national donation to resist Japan today has not yet seen any results, it is enough to show the motivation of our nation to save the country by itself. We say that this spark of motivation should be cultivated and expanded today. There are many crises and difficulties in the future of the country, and we rely on our people to use this breath of conscience to further develop the ability of our entire nation and unite the spirit of our entire nation to shoulder the great task of reversing the fate of the country. If this spark of motivation is suddenly blocked for no reason by the current unfortunate problems, how can its relationship be regarded as small? Moreover, this so-called current unfortunate problem is only shrouded in temporary clouds of suspicion. Once it is clarified, the innocent will be innocent, and the guilty will be guilty. The guilty will be abandoned by the people, and the innocent will show their noble character and be trusted by the people. If there is still true right and wrong in the world, there will eventually be a day when the truth comes out. Our people do not need to lose heart because of temporary indignation and destroy the courage of our entire nation to save the country.</p>
<p>Moreover, we have more to say. Today's events are not only not a reason to lose heart, but also a reason to redouble our efforts. In this society where confusion reigns and black and white are indistinguishable, people's hearts are becoming increasingly numb. Those who see righteousness and act bravely may not gain the trust of others, while those who take advantage of opportunities and act for their own benefit are praised by everyone. No matter how fair a person is, society will always have some doubts about them. No matter how good their intentions are, they will always be measured with malicious intent. To do something in this situation, the person must be willing to sacrifice their reputation first. Otherwise, they can only sit back and watch. This kind of social state has been formed over a long period of time and cannot be corrected overnight. Now, the investigation of the national salvation donation is a good opportunity to correct social people's hearts. Because once this problem is thoroughly investigated, the truth can be immediately clarified, and the phenomenon of cloudy haze in recent days can be swept away. From then on, those who are enthusiastic about donating wealth to save the country can deeply believe that the donations they make are guaranteed and will never be wasted. And those who handle the donations, if they are truly frank and selfless, will also have their personal credit guaranteed and will not be destroyed by unfounded rumors. In this way, we can encourage their sense of public service and advance on the road to saving the country together. Why would they lose heart?</p>
<p>Therefore, both the investigation committee, the donation receiving organizations, and the general public hope that the central government will send personnel to investigate thoroughly. The relationship is not only for this one-time national salvation donation but also for the countless national salvation undertakings in the future. If the central government can conduct a swift and thorough investigation with a fair and selfless attitude, then the people will not only not lose heart but will also arouse countless national salvation hearts. If they treat it like other cases where senior officials are sent to handle it, procrastinate, or deal with it vaguely, then right and wrong will never be clear, and it will truly discourage the hearts of our people.</p>
<h3>Key to Solving the Cabinet Crisis: Saito and Suzuki Meet for the First Time</h3>
<p>No Specific Discussion of National Policy</p>
<p>Suzuki Advocates Stabilizing Public Sentiment First</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Prime Minister Saito went to Suzuki's residence in Kojimachi at 9:00 a.m. today to meet with President Suzuki. The Prime Minister earnestly requested Suzuki to say that now is a time of great urgency, and there are many facilities that need to be realized in the future. Please assist the government in implementing its administration with a spirit of national unity. Suzuki questioned the Prime Minister about the government's views and then said that it is appropriate for the Seiyukai to agree with the government on national policy and work hard to assist in its realization. However, a response must be given after consultation with the party's organs. The meeting between the two lasted half an hour. Today's talks did not seem to involve specific issues. Suzuki plans to visit the Prime Minister within the day to formally negotiate specific issues. After the meeting, Prime Minister Saito told reporters, "President Suzuki listened to the content of the issues that we hope for and said that he would consult with the party's organs and then give a response. Our meeting was very satisfactory. I believe that the spirit of the two people has been unified. Future meetings will exchange views on various specific issues. Therefore, specific matters were not discussed today. I will meet with President Wakatsuki of the Minseito party tomorrow morning. Mr. Wakatsuki stated that the spirit of national unity in times of great urgency is slightly different from Mr. Suzuki's view. However, what I want to say is the same as today."

<h3>How to Handle Diplomacy and National Defense</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) President Suzuki of the Seiyukai made the following remarks after meeting with Prime Minister Saito this morning: "Prime Minister Saito stated the hope for a union with a very faint spirit of national unity and requested assistance. I replied that my concerns about the current situation are the same as each other. My concerns are related to national policy. As in the case of the Emperor's Rescript, even after Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it must still coordinate with other countries. It cannot be isolated with the temperament of an island nation. However, I do not think that the government is handling diplomatic relations poorly. National defense must be strengthened, but strengthening with the aim of war really needs to be considered. For the sake of peace, national defense is necessary. I asked the Prime Minister about the government's views on this matter. The Prime Minister said that he could not speak specifically. Since the public trial of the defendants in the May 15th Incident, people have felt quite uneasy, and the government must find the root cause of the uneasiness and remove it. I plan to visit the Prime Minister in two or three days to present the policies of our party." (Telegram from the 23rd, Electric Communication)</p>
<h3>Assist the Government in Implementing National Policy</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Seiyukai held a meeting of its executives at 2:00 p.m. today and then opened a general meeting of its members at 3:00 p.m., deciding on the following fundamental attitude: Since the government has recognized the Seiyukai's claims regarding the current situation and requested the implementation of national policy with a spirit of national unity, the Seiyukai will also proceed with the agreement of the essential national policies with a modest and frank mind and actively assist the government in implementing national policy.

<h3>Border Dispute Between Russia and Puppet State</h3>
<p>Russian Citizens Invade Puppet State Territory</p>
<p>Puppet State Lodges Protest with Russia</p>

The puppet state's Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to take decisive measures as a countermeasure. It stated the following today: Recently, Soviet Russian people have invaded the national border, or entered the country without notification. Many acts of infringement of sovereignty have occurred. These acts are committed by Soviet Russian soldiers and officials, which is extremely unlawful. The Soviet Russian response to the "Manchukuo" protest has not been appropriate. "Manchukuo" plans to reiterate the past illegal acts in the protest and seriously urge the Soviet Russian side to reflect. (Telegram from the 22nd, Electric Communication)</p>
<h3>French Occupation of Nine Small Islands: Japanese Protest Contents</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has recently released the full text of its protest to France regarding the prior occupation of nine islands. The main points are as follows: (1) The Japan Lassa Phosphate Mining Company, under the protection and recognition of the government, has continued its business on the islands. Although the business was temporarily suspended, it did not abandon the occupation and use of the islands. This is an important fact and cannot be equated with France's mere establishment of navigational markers in the same year. (2) The French government's prior occupation was not accompanied by the actual occupation deemed necessary under international law. (3) The French government, without considering the above relationship or inquiring about Japan's intentions, hastily announced the possession of the islands, which is highly inappropriate. (4) This issue has created a negative impression on the friendly relations between Japan and France. The Japanese government sincerely hopes that the French government will give it deep and effective consideration. (Twenty-third, Dentsu News Agency)</p>

<p>(Paris) France and Britain are currently considering abolishing import control regulations imposed on Austria to alleviate its distress. Italy is also likely to join. France has proposed that when considering the grand economic rehabilitation plan for Austria-Hungary and the Little Entente, the rates for Austrian imports should be abolished or revised.

<h3>US Government Negotiates Commercial Treaties Separately with South American Countries</h3>
<p>Reciprocity as the Principle</p>
<p>National Gazette, Washington, Twenty-second The US government's plan to conclude reciprocal trade agreements with Latin American countries has begun today. Deputy Secretary of State Philip has begun negotiations with Colombian Minister Lozano and special envoy Guzman. According to the State Department, there may be news of an agreement being reached within this week. It is reported that Colombia hopes to promote the sale of coffee, cocoa, copper, and leather in the United States, while the United States wants to promote the sale of certain manufactured goods. It is likely that tariffs will be mutually reduced or exempted for these exchanged goods to facilitate sales. Once the US-</p>
<p>Colombia reciprocal agreement is reached, negotiations will begin with Argentina to conclude a similar agreement. Latin American diplomatic circles believe that this negotiation is sufficient to give a new importance to the Pan-American movement. The Pan-American movement has mostly been conducted only in cultural aspects so far. If several reciprocal agreements can be concluded before December, then the Pan-American Conference (ie, the Inter-American Conference) to be held in Montevideo at that time can also discuss commercial matters. Also, according to a statement from the State Department, the World Economic Conference has indicated that Western Hemisphere countries will inevitably have to deal with the larger economic and commercial issues that are being affected. It is also said that the US government will adopt a strictly fair policy regarding the new treaty, so that no one will exclusively enjoy the trade preferences allowed therein.</p>

Some well-known figures have secretly instructed cotton brokers to advise customers that the national cotton purchasing power has been exhausted, and there is a great tendency to sell December futures.

<h3>South Irish Government Bans Blue Shirts</h3>
<p>At the Same Time, a Proclamation Establishes Military Tribunal</p>
<p>Severe Laws and Harsh Penalties for Political Prisoners</p>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, Twenty-second The Irish Free State government today announced that the National Guard, commanded by General O'Duffy, namely the Blue Shirts, is an illegal organization. At the same time, it proclaimed the establishment of a military tribunal. This move was decided by the Executive Council of the Free State government, and everyone had long expected that it could not be avoided. Before the government's announcement, the Minister of Defense had issued instructions prohibiting officers and soldiers of the Army Reserve from joining the Blue Shirts or other secret societies. General O'Duffy is very stubborn, and his arrangements to maintain the Blue Shirts are now nearing completion, clearly intending to resist the government. However, he has warned officers and soldiers of the Reserve Army to withdraw from the Blue Shirts.</p>
<p>Reuters, Dublin, Twenty-third The South Irish government's ban on the Blue Shirts has made the atmosphere here even more tense. With the slightest conflict, the government will arrest National Guard personnel and try them by military tribunal. The military tribunal will have the power to impose unlimited punishments on various political prisoners, ranging from light floggings to capital punishment. However, it is generally expected that the government will not immediately arrest people. It is likely that the government will start by confiscating private military equipment. The National Guard is scheduled to hold a meeting in Cottymore today, and General O'Duffy will attend and give a speech. The results of this meeting are now attracting much attention.</p>

<h3>Gran Chaco Dispute: Bolivian-Paraguayan War Unabated</h3>
<p>Mediation by Four South American Countries Ineffective</p>
<p>To Be Referred Back to the League of Nations for Handling</p>
<p>National Gazette, Buenos Aires, Twenty-second The dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay over the Gran Chaco (ie, Chaco), which has been going on for years, will now be returned to the League of Nations for handling. It was heard today that Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Peru have decided that they cannot resolve or achieve a ceasefire. They will soon notify the League of Nations of their inability to assist. The mediation of the Gran Chaco dispute first moved from Argentina to the United States, then entered the League of Nations, and then was transferred from the League of Nations to the four South American countries, which can be said to have gone full circle. The war still flares up from time to time and has not ended. Even from an international law perspective, no one here can determine its true status. All countries and organizations engaged in mediation have spent a lot of brainpower and money, without any results. The efforts of the four South American countries to mediate on behalf of the League of Nations have clearly failed again, because neither Bolivia nor Paraguay is willing to agree to the basic conditions for a ceasefire. Although the two countries have appealed to the League of Nations several times, neither is willing to comply with its advice. According to what was heard today, Paraguay's attitude is that it is unwilling to engage in any peace negotiations until the League of Nations or any other organization has achieved a truce. However, Bolivia's attitude is that it is unwilling to cease fire until the League of Nations or its representatives have resolved the entire issue. According to the opinions of diplomats here, under this situation, the war will continue indefinitely, or it may continue for many years and still not be resolved, because the two countries have been at war over the above issues for fifty years. Recently, Paraguay appealed to the League of Nations, saying that Bolivian troops, under the leadership of Germans, will use poison gas, incendiary bombs, and other new weapons to launch an attack, and the League of Nations should stop it. However, the League of Nations has not yet responded, because this matter cannot be dealt with by empty words. At present, there is much criticism among people in South American countries regarding the League of Nations' Committee for Handling the Gran Chaco Issue not sending its own specialists, but entrusting the four South American countries to mediate on its behalf. Although the diplomats of the four countries organized a committee under the supervision of the League of Nations and, according to the instructions of the Council of the League of Nations to the Committee of the League of Nations, drew up a ceasefire plan and asked Paraguay to cancel the propaganda, Paraguay refused to comply. They also asked the two parties to submit the entire territory of the Gran Chaco to arbitration, but both sides were unwilling to comply. Therefore, the four countries, considering that mediation was hopeless, prepared to ask the League of Nations to handle it itself and send another delegation. South American countries will no longer participate. Even the Neutral Committee, which was originally organized by the United States, is afraid that it will no longer be willing to mediate, because they transferred this issue to the League of Nations because of the failure of mediation.</p>

<p>Colluding with Bandits to Protect Criminals</p>
<p>Havas, New York, Twenty-second Federal Prosecutor Midary today accused five Democratic congressmen and one Republican congressman of colluding with bandits. The political world was shocked by the news. This matter was raised during a secret meeting of jurors in New York. For a week, there have been rumors that criminal groups are being protected by several congressmen. This group not only works for these congressmen politically, but also provides the money needed for election campaigns.</p>
<h3>A Scene of Naval Warfare</h3>
<p>French Striking Sailors Obstruct Traffic</p>
<p>Navy Tugs Use Hoses to Spray Water</p>
<p>Reuters, Paris, Twenty-second The strike by French canal workers demanding shorter working hours and closing the gates at night caused a "naval war" on the Seine River this morning. Last night, sailors rode bicycles to the confluence of the Seine and the Voisne Rivers, using many flat-bottomed heavy boats to block the Seine River, in order to prevent ships from coming and going. The ships were driven by two hundred men, women, and children. The men all held boat hooks. The gendarmes intervened, but were repelled. Then naval tugs arrived and used hoses to spray water to fight. Although the strikers were drenched, they resisted strongly until they were attacked from both sides and surrendered. Fifty strikers have now been detained. The place of the battle is the town of Conflans. Although it is now quiet after the battle, the entire town is under siege, with armed police and marines patrolling the streets in an endless stream. The Seine River is now open to navigation, but the Voisne River is still blocked.</p>
<p>The Minister of Public Works is now trying to mediate in order to get the workers to return to work as soon as possible.</p>

<p>Beiping Correspondence Chahar Chairman Song Zheyuan, Pang Bingxun, Xiong Bin, Qin Dechun, and others left Ping by special train on the twenty-first. They arrived in Zhangjiakou at about 4 pm that afternoon. Pang got off the train in Xuanhua to inspect his troops and will go to Zhangjiakou in two or three days to organize the bandit suppression headquarters. It is said that Song and others had sent a telegram to Tong Linge in Zhangjiakou before leaving Ping, requesting him to invite Sun Liangcheng, Ji Hongchang, Fang Zhenwu, and others in person or to send representatives to Zhangjiakou to meet. When Song and others arrived in Zhangjiakou, Sun Liangcheng had already arrived in Zhangjiakou to wait. The result of the meeting between Song and Sun was very satisfactory. Sun agreed to leave Chahar within days. As for Fang and Ji, Song planned to send people to mediate separately. Last night and this morning, he telegraphed Minister He three times to report on the situation after arriving in Chahar, and urged Jiang Bocheng to go to Zhangjiakou immediately to assist with everything. Jiang was scheduled to go to Zhangjiakou with Xiao Zhenying, Hou Ying, and others by train at 11:50 am on the twenty-third. As for the funds for the rehabilitation of Chahar Province, in addition to the 100,000 yuan of demobilization expenses that Song Zheyuan brought, the 150,000 yuan of living expenses for the reorganized part will be distributed along with the August salary after the central government's Huabei Assistance Funds arrive in Ping. When Song Zheyuan left Ping, he said at the station that he and Minister He and others had agreed on a plan for the rehabilitation of Chahar Province in Ping these days. He will return to Zhangjiakou today and implement it step by step according to the proposed plan. Chahar Province's rehabilitation</p>
<p>The relief fund of 100,000 yuan has been received and brought to Chahar today. The remaining amount will be requested from the military branch to be reissued and given to the mixed troops for food expenses to maintain them for half a month. The number of mixed troops to be reorganized is currently not determined, but the principle is to recruit those who have complete firearms and are disciplined. As for the placement of mixed troops generals, I have telegraphed to invite them to Zhangjiakou to meet. Ji Hongchang sent a telegram to me yesterday expressing his attitude. Others such as Sun Liangcheng, Zhang Renjie, and Ruan Xuanwu can also come to Zhangjiakou. Li Shuping also sent a telegram saying that he may come to Zhangjiakou to meet. The issue of the reorganization of the Chahar Provincial Government, the heads of various departments will be announced in about a day. The position of the head of the education department will be filled by Mr. Lu Fu, who has a good reputation. Lu and I have never met. As for Chahar Province's staffing and administration, the rectification will start from the provincial government and then extend to the counties. However, Chahar Province is barren and the people are poor, and it has been burdened by the stationing of tens of thousands of troops. Regarding Duolun, it is heard that the highest authorities have negotiated with the Japanese side and should abide by the truce agreement and implement the withdrawal. The puppet army of Li Shouxin in that area has not moved westward. I have discussed with Minister He that because the Chahar Province rehabilitation issue is complicated, Minister He should send Jiang Bocheng, Xiong Bin, and Hou Ying, a staff member of the military branch, to Zhangjiakou to assist in handling it. I will report to Minister He in Ping after the rehabilitation of Chahar Province is completed.</p>
<h3>Relief From The Yellow Peril</h3>
<p>Han Fuqu Requests Formation of Downstream Reorganization Committee</p>
<p>Wang Yingyu Arrives in Shandong to Discuss Relief Measures</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: After the breach at Changyuan on the south bank of the Yellow River, the water inundated the areas of Heze and Cao County, and continued to flow eastward. As of around 3:00 PM on the 21st, the floodwaters had reached Jining in western Shandong and were about to pour into the Grand Canal. The entire area of Jinxiang, Jiaxiang, Lutai, Yuncheng, Juye, and Chengwu became a vast expanse of water, with depths of several feet on level ground. Refugees were fleeing in endless streams. The water from the breach at Shitou Village on the north bank of the Yellow River reached Dong'e in Shandong Province and flowed back into the Yellow River, causing the river to rise rapidly for days. The water level in Fan County and Shou Zhang exceeded the dikes, creating an extremely dangerous situation. Houses inside the dikes were washed away, with water depths of four feet on level ground and over ten feet in deeper areas. The disaster area stretched approximately thirty *li* north-south and fifty *li* east-west, encompassing over 340 villages. Over 3,000 *qing* of land were flooded, destroying crops and livestock. The sight of the vast, watery expanse was utterly desolate.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the above report, Shandong Province Chairman Han Fuqu, recognizing the increasing severity of the disaster in western Shandong and the urgent need for relief, convened an emergency meeting on the morning of the 21st with Civil Affairs Director Li Shuchun, Construction Director Zhang Honglie, Education Director He Siyuan, Provincial Committee Member Zhang Weicun, and Secretary-General Zhang Shaotang, among others. They discussed ways to provide relief and assistance to the disaster victims. Regarding the central government's call for a six-province flood conference, it was decided to send Construction Director Zhang Honglie and River Affairs Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia to Beijing to attend the meeting. They resolved to use 310,000 yuan from the Provincial Relief Committee's reserves for emergency relief (the first batch being 48,000 yuan), dispatching Provincial Counselor Li Tianni and Relief Committee members Yan Zijing and Guo Wensheng with 10,000 yuan to the Fan County and Shou Zhang area on the north bank for emergency relief. Counselor Fan Zhuxian and Relief Committee member Wang Peizhang were dispatched with 10,000 yuan to the Heze area on the south bank for emergency relief. Additionally, they planned to save 2 million yuan from other expenses to be used for disaster relief. A telegram was drafted to the central government stating that Shandong was doing its best to prevent the river from overflowing, but that Henan and Hebei had not repaired their river works. The breaches made Shandong a catchment area. They requested the central government to allocate 10 or 20 million yuan to repair this section of the river works. Otherwise, for the sake of self-preservation, Shandong would build a 200-*li*-long dike, one *zhang* wide and five *chi* high, at Heze to ensure safety. The Yellow River's water level continued to rise on the 21st in all areas. At Luokou, it rose a total of 1.8 *cun* morning and evening, reaching a water level of 30.78 meters, only 7.2 *cun* below the top of the levee. The level at Guanzhuang upstream rose 3.7 *cun*, while at Xiezhiwan downstream, it surged by 1.2 *chi*. At Dama Village, it rose 8.7 *cun*. All sections were under extreme pressure, with an extremely dangerous situation. Amidst the urgent calls, another alarming report arrived from Feicheng. According to the Shandong Provincial Government's disaster investigation specialist in Yunxie, from 3:00 AM to 4:00 AM on the 20th, there were heavy rain and wind above Guanzhuang, and the area inside the Shou Zhang dike became a vast expanse of water. In several places, the water level was even with the dike, creating an extremely dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Shandong Province Chairman Han Fuqu, seeing the expansion of the disaster area in western Shandong and its continued rapid rise, felt that for the sake of overall relief, a Yellow River Downstream Reorganization Committee should be formed by the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Hebei, etc., with a senior official specially appointed by the central government as its chairman, to jointly plan everything. He telegraphed this idea to Chairman Lin, President Wang, and Chairman Chiang, and also sent telegrams to Jiangsu Chairman Gu Zhutong, Anhui Chairman Liu Zhenhua, Henan Chairman Liu Zhi, and Hebei Chairman Yu Xuezhong, seeking their agreement. The telegram sent to Wang is recorded as follows: "To President Wang Jingwei of the Executive Yuan, Secret: The serious disaster situation in Shandong Province due to the Yellow River breach has been repeatedly reported by telegram, and we urgently request your prompt allocation of funds for relief. We have recently received a telegram from Henan Chairman Liu Xiao, stating that he has already telegraphed your Yuan to appoint a senior official to reside in Bian Zheng (Kaifeng and Zhengzhou), convene a meeting nearby, and supervise the repair of dikes and the relief of disaster victims. In my opinion, it would be appropriate at this time for the provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Henan, Shandong, and Hebei to form a Yellow River Downstream Reorganization Committee, with the specially appointed senior official as the chairman, and each province along the river sending a member to reside at the committee, to discuss and implement plans as opportunities arise, which would be more convenient. I have already telegraphed Henan Chairman Liu and Jiangsu Chairman Gu, seeking their agreement. This matter concerns the lives and property of the people of several provinces. How should it be handled? I respectfully present this matter by telegram and humbly request your examination and implementation. [Signed] Your subordinate, Han Fuqu, respectfully bows."</p>
<p>Since the Yellow River flood had occurred, the Executive Yuan specially ordered the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to quickly devise relief measures, and allocated 500,000 yuan from the Yangtze River flood prevention funds for the Yellow River Conservancy Commission to use for Yellow River management. Although the Yellow River Committee had been established, its inaugural meeting was originally scheduled for the 25th of next month in Kaifeng. Due to the sudden river change, it had begun operating earlier. Chairman Li Yizhi immediately dispatched Vice Chairman Wang Yingyu, along with committee member and Secretary-General Zhang Hanying, to Henan to meet with Henan Province Chairman Liu Zhi, and to Jinan to meet with Shandong Province Chairman Han Fuqu, to discuss the Yellow River problem. Wang and Zhang took a surveying airplane No. 1 of the Surveying Bureau of the General Staff Headquarters at 9 o'clock in the morning of the 21st, took off from Beijing, and arrived in Jinan at 6:30 in the afternoon. After getting off the plane, they went to the provincial government to meet Han, and reported the situation they saw along the way. Then they went to the Jiaoji Hotel to rest. Today (the 22nd) at 10 am, after the completion of the political meeting, Han hosted a banquet in the provincial government to welcome Wang and Zhang, with the directors and the entire members of the provincial government present. During the banquet, there was a concrete consultation on the downstream flood prevention of the Yellow River, and then dispersed at eleven o'clock. According to Wang and Zhang's main task to Jinan, and the current situation of the disaster area along the way, they said that this trip to Shandong was ordered by Chairman Li Yizhi to discuss the downstream flood prevention measures of the Yellow River and to investigate the disaster area. Yesterday (the 21st) at 9 am, they took off from Beijing, first went to Xuzhou to inspect the disaster situation in Feng County, and saw the water in the Dasha River was very fierce, fortunately, it was still in the river trough and had not overflowed. Then, they flew west along the old course of the Yellow River. When passing Yucheng, they saw the breach of the Yellow River in Lanfeng, and the water flow had stopped, and the situation had eased, which was not as dangerous as a few days ago. However, the breach was not closed. At 1:40 pm, they arrived in Kaifeng, on the one hand, they landed upstream in Kaifeng, on the other hand, they visited Chairman Liu to discuss flood prevention measures and the method of collecting civilian husbands, but due to the time constraints, there was no detailed consultation, and Chairman Liu promised to consider the proposed method slightly and reply in a day or two. At four o'clock, they took a plane to leave Kaifeng again, passing the east of Kaocheng, Dongming into the Heze area of ​​Shandong Province, and near Changyuan of Hebei Province. Due to time constraints, they did not go to the breach of Changyuan to check, but saw the breaches in other places, the water had stopped flowing, but in Dongming, Heze, the whole area was in the water, the traffic was cut off, and the water was shallow and small and could not pass the boats, the food was scarce, it was not easy to replenish, and the situation was even more terrible. The villages and fields were all flooded, the Yellow River was vast and boundless, it was really a huge disaster. Now, they plan to consult the opinions of President Liu of Henan Province and President Han of Shandong Province, and then decide on flood prevention measures. The first step is to treat the symptoms and do their best for flood prevention measures. It is scheduled to hold a flood prevention meeting in Beijing on the 28th of this month. As for the long-term plan, it is necessary to discuss in detail and wait until the Yellow River Conservancy Commission holds a meeting in Kaifeng on the 25th of next month. Before the official meeting, the Yellow River Conservancy Commission is temporarily under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, but because the flood suddenly occurred, it was decided to start working first and then hold the inauguration meeting. In addition to the Chairman Li Yizhi, Vice Chairman Wang Yingyu, Committee member and Secretary Zhang Hanying, Committee members Xu Xinwu, Shen Yi, Chen Panling, and Li Peiji, the rest of the construction halls of the nine provinces of the Yellow River are all natural members, and the heads of the river affairs bureaus of Hebei and Shandong provinces are also invited to participate. The Huai River Commission is also invited to send personnel to attend the meeting at the time to guide everything. The rest of them will not stay in Jinan for long, and they will return to Beijing in two or three days to report and prepare for everything. Wang Yingyu also talked about the Yellow River has been the biggest problem in the past years, the reason is that there is no dam at the mouth of the sea, the water is immersed at will, the soil and sand are silted up, the venting is blocked, and the tail stream is not smooth, which leads to dangerous projects in various tours, and dams should be built at the mouth of the Yellow River to smooth the water flow. The dam of Tongyuanxiang in the old Yellow River of Lanfeng has not been repaired, and the Yellow River breaches and still enters the old course, it will enter the Huai River and then into the Yangtze River, and the Yangtze and Huai Rivers will be flooded, so the Tongyuanxiang dam is the security of the Yangtze and Huai Rivers and needs to be built. The central government is now allocating 500,000 yuan for the Yangtze River flood prevention to govern the Yellow River and handing it over to Yu for distribution. This small amount is far from enough to govern the entire river, so Yu proposed to use this money to build the sea mouth and Tongyuanxiang dams, which will be handled by Shandong and Henan provinces. According to the calculation of the upper Cheng, the dam at the entrance to the sea needs more than one million yuan, and the dam at Tongyuanxiang needs 450,000 yuan, which is still not enough, but if the soldiers work together with the artisans, the money will be half and the work will be doubled. It is planned to hand over 300,000 yuan to Han Chairman of Shandong to be responsible for repairing the dam at the mouth of the sea, and if it is not enough, Shandong will find a way. The remaining 200,000 yuan is used to measure the important places of the Yellow River, about 6,000 cubic kilometers, the area occupies a scale of 25,000 to one, and it needs more than 1,000 yuan, and the remaining money is handed over to Chairman Liu of Henan, and Liu is requested to transfer to the chairmen of Jiangsu and Anhui, and the three provinces will jointly repair the dam of Tongyuanxiang. Yu saw Chairman Han about this matter, and Han expressed his approval. Yu has telegraphed Chairman Chiang, President Wang, and Chairman Lin to report, and notified Chairman Liu of Henan, and asked the central government to transfer to the provinces to find a way to collect money to relieve the disaster victims and block the gap gates.</p>
<h3>The Yellow River Iron Bridge Repair Project is Huge</h3>
<p>The Pinghan Railway Resumed Traffic Again on the 21st</p>
<p>The Estimated Cost of Repairing the Iron Bridge is Approximately Five Million Yuan</p>
<p>It Will Be Handled by the Economic Commission and the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Chiang Orders Xiao Zhichu to Be Fully Responsible for Protecting the Southern Section of the Railway</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The Yellow River Iron Bridge on the Pinghan Railway, which was previously tilted by floods and traffic was interrupted for seven days, during which all southbound vehicles only opened to Xinxiang, and then returned to Beiping, northbound vehicles can only pass to Zhengzhou. The road bureau has suffered a great loss, and travelers are even more afraid of it. He Jingwu, chairman of the road management committee, Xiao Qinan, a member, and Wang Jinzhi, director of the engineering office, all personally visited the work site to supervise the rush repair. On the 16th, traffic was barely opened, and on the 17th, traffic was smooth, but after only one day, it was found that the bridge body was sunken, especially between the 50th and 90th holes, which was very dangerous. North-south traffic was interrupted for the second time. He Jingwu, etc. re-implemented the foundation protection work, paving the bridge foundation with boulders. On the 20th, the project was completed, and on the 21st, the special express train resumed traffic again, but the locomotive was still removed on both sides of the bridge and pushed by manpower when crossing the bridge. Ordinary express trains and ordinary passenger cars still stopped at Xinxiang and Zhengzhou. According to the survey of the bridge by the Engineering Bureau, and the estimated repair cost, it is about 5 million yuan, if it is thoroughly repaired, it will cost more than 20 million yuan, which has been reported to the management committee for verification. According to the news from the association, the project is so huge, and it is also the time when the national treasury is exhausted, and it is really difficult to repair it, but the north-south traffic is important, and it can not be abandoned without repair, and it will be handled by the National Economic Commission and the Ministry of Railways. In addition, the road protection matters of the road, the northern section is not important, the southern section is adjacent to the bandit suppression area, and there is a risk of cutting off the line and disturbing the travelers at any time. Xiao Zhichu, commander of the 26th Army, returned from the Anti-Japanese War, and was ordered to take full responsibility for protecting the southern section of the road. Chiang believed that the army had only the 44th Division, which was probably not enough to allocate, and because the troops stationed along the road could not be unified, the 34th Independent Brigade of Luo Qijiang, the 13th Cavalry Brigade of Liu Fengqi, and the 130th Brigade of the 64th Division of Liu Zhenhua, as well as various teams along the road, were assigned to Xiao to command in one affair. Xiao came to Hankou a few days ago to pay respects to He Chengjun and Xu Yuanquan. He has now completed his official duties and will return to Jigongshan on the 22nd by train. (22nd)</p>
<h3>The Tragedy of the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway Train Derailment and Fall into the Water</h3>
<p>More Than Two Hundred People Were Killed and Injured When the Train Fell into the River</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: On the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway from Nanchang to Jiujiang, a car accident occurred at 2:35 pm on the 20th of this month, killing and injuring more than 200 people. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Roadbed Near Lehua Was Washed Away. At the beginning of last month, the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway was washed away in many places due to continuous rain, mountain torrents, and river floods. The railway bridge of Lehua Xinxizhou section, such as No. 115.126, was also washed away by the water, and the train stopped for nearly a week. Later, Director Fan of the road supervised the staff to repair day and night, and set up a temporary bridge with sandbags and sleepers to barely open the traffic. Since then, when the train passes through the newly repaired road section and the temporary bridge, it is replaced by a small car head to tow it, but it is shaky, and the passengers are panicked when passing by.</p>
<p>The Car Derails and Falls into the River. At 11 am on the 20th, more than 500 officers and soldiers of the security team training in Lushan took 15 extra cars prepared by the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway from Shahe South. At 2:30 pm, they arrived at the Xinxizhou station. Because it was not far from the Lehua temporary bridge, in order to avoid danger, the car head was transferred to the back of the car as usual, so that it could be pushed to the north of the bridge. At that time, the original car head returned to Xunyang, and another small car head was pulled south across the bridge to the province. It was unexpected that when the car was traveling to the temporary bridge of Cigu Temple, the car suddenly derailed and fell into the river, and there was a loud noise like a mountain collapse and ground crack. (According to one theory, this car and a sleeper car could not give way to each other, so it overturned. Another theory said that when the car was pushed to the temporary bridge, it derailed because the track was slightly curved and the driving was not smooth. The road bureau is investigating in detail. Passengers in the car were killed and injured, their heads were broken and their waists were folded, and it was too cruel to bear. After the accident, the car chief Xiong immediately reported to the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway Station by telephone. After receiving the report, Director Fan supervised all the staff and doctors to go to the rescue. Fortunately, Nanchang is only 30 miles away from Lehua, and the Niuxing stationmaster has already invited doctors from Nanchang Hospital to come and carry out emergency rescue work. It is heard that the total number of deaths and injuries is about 100 to 200 people, and dozens of people were killed, most of whom were injured. All of them were rescued and applied medicine by the staff sent by the road. As for how many people died, it was not known for a while. All the bodies are still being cleaned. The overturned car has been moved out of the track by the workers. It is expected that traffic can be restored as usual tomorrow.</p>
<p>Heavily in Debt and Poorly in Business</p>
<p>According to people in the transportation industry, the Nanchang-Xunyang Railway is only a few hundred miles long, and it owes millions of yuan of debt, and the economic situation has been unable to support it for a long time. In recent years, due to the decline in production and the disappearance of freight, the military cars have been non-stop day and night in the six-year period of bandit suppression, and the business is unimaginable. Recently, due to economic relations, various repair projects are extremely difficult, so the temporary bridge cannot be restored to its original state as soon as possible. (August 20)</p>

After receiving the report, the provincial government, in order to preserve the antiquities, has telegraphed the county magistrate of the county to order his subordinates to protect them properly and strictly prohibit ignorant people from mining and profiting. It also ordered the Department of Education to inform the Provincial Library to send people to collect and transport them to the province for display in the museum for exhibition. The museum has sent people there. (August 22)</p>

<h3>Boatmen Urge the Cessation of Levying Stone Tax</h3>
<p>In various districts of Jiangyin Shazhou, there are more than 300 boatmen from Shaoxing, Zhejiang Province, who have been engaged in the business of carrying stones. Since the late Qing Dynasty, Zhang Jianzhi has been handling the Baotan Association in Tong, and hired the boatmen to transport rocks to Changshan and other places for more than 20 years. The purchased rocks have always been purchased directly from the rock owners by the boatmen, and the rock owners deliver the goods and pay the value according to the tonnage. There has never been a stone industry established. In March of this year, Yin and others, who had leased a shop, suddenly set up a stone industry and collected five cents per ton of donation. At that time, the business was stopped and the party and government were urged to stop it. Recently, it has been renamed to collect commissions and value the price. Boatmen Zhang Baowei and others submitted another petition to the party department, urging the county to issue a strict prohibition to prevent the forced coercion and maintain the livelihood of the boatmen.</p>

<h3>Recent Situation of Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>In the Past, They Mostly Dominated Commerce</p>
<p>Recently, There Has Been a Growing Decline</p>
<p>A Central News Agency report stated that overseas Chinese engaged in trade abroad used to hold a significant position. In recent years, due to economic downturns in various countries, many overseas Chinese have been affected, resulting in tens of thousands of unemployed. In the Nanyang region, the rubber and tin industries have declined, leading to even greater losses for overseas Chinese, with many returning to their home country. Furthermore, the implementation of anti-Chinese policies in countries such as Mexico has made it increasingly difficult for overseas Chinese to establish a foothold. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter specifically interviewed Huang Jianzhong, the director-general of the Shanghai Chinese Overseas Association, to inquire about the recent situation of overseas Chinese in recent years. Huang provided a detailed response and shared various aspects of the recent survey conducted by the association on overseas Chinese. These are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Population Distribution: According to the latest survey, the largest number of overseas Chinese reside in the Nanyang Archipelago, followed by Europe and the Americas, then North Australia and South Africa. In the Nanyang Archipelago, there are approximately 420,000 people in Vietnam, about 2,000,000 in Siam (Thailand), about 300,000 in Burma (Myanmar), about 1,800,000 in the Malay Peninsula, about 1,200,000 in the Dutch East Indies, and about 100,000 in British Borneo (all figures based on surveys by local immigration departments). In North and South America, there are approximately 80,000 in the United States, about 6,000 in Canada, about 20,000 in Mexico, about 20,000 in Cuba, about 20,000 in Panama, about 20,000 in Guatemala, about 20,000 in Jamaica, about 30,000 in Honolulu, about 28,000 in Brazil, and about 50,000 in Peru. In Europe, there are approximately 30,000 residing in London, Marseille, The Hague, and Belgium. About 20,000 people reside in Saint Louis and the Madagascar Archipelago. In Australia, approximately 50,000 reside in the Commonwealth of Australia. In Asia, there are approximately 40,000 in Japan, about 40,000 in Korea, about 3,000,000 in Taiwan, about 30,000 in India, about 250,000 in Siberia, about 600,000 in Hong Kong, and about 80,000 in Macau (all figures based on surveys by local customs offices). The total is approximately 10,278,000 people.</p>
<p>Commercial Situation: The overseas Chinese engaged in business also have the strongest presence in the Nanyang region. The Nanyang overseas Chinese mainly deal in rubber, followed by tin, and then gambier and pepper. In the past, the price of rubber was over 200 yuan per picul, but now it has dropped to just over 10 yuan per picul, a difference of twenty times. The extent of the losses can be seen from this. With the price of rubber so low, rubber plantations have stopped tapping, and business has virtually come to a standstill, resulting in tens of thousands of unemployed Chinese workers. This is not only the case for the rubber industry; the tin industry and others have suffered the same losses. The reason why overseas Chinese have been able to gain a foothold in the Nanyang region is because they hold economic power. Now, due to the decline of the rubber and tin industries, they have suffered huge losses. Therefore, the economic position of overseas Chinese in the Nanyang region is bound to be affected. As for the overseas Chinese businesses in Europe and the Americas, they are also gradually being suppressed due to the poor economic situation in various countries, and things are getting worse year by year. If immediate action is not taken to save them, the overseas Chinese will have no place to stand.</p>
<p>Discrimination: In recent years, overseas Chinese have often been looked down upon by foreigners. Examples include Mexico's expulsion of Chinese, Siam's regulations on education requiring Chinese to learn Siamese, Singapore's restrictions on the entry of Chinese, the Dutch East Indies' strict inspection of Chinese import procedures and the imposition of surtaxes on goods, and Annam's restrictions on immigration. All of these have been implemented. There are many others that have not yet been implemented. Therefore, it is becoming increasingly difficult for overseas Chinese to do business overseas. It is hoped that the people of our country will pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Organization of Associations: Overseas Chinese are extremely hardworking and have made considerable progress in various undertakings. Taking commerce as an example, they have been able to take control of the economic power in the Nanyang region because of their good management. However, recently, there has been a decline. According to the latest survey by the association, the number of Chinese Chambers of Commerce organized by overseas Chinese in various places can indicate the state of Chinese business in that area. There are 22 in Peru, 17 in Java, 12 in the Philippines, 12 in the Federated Malay States, 9 in North and South Borneo, 6 in Korea, 6 in Sumatra, 4 in Japan, 4 in Chile, 4 in Celebes, 3 in Australia, 3 in Annam, 3 in the United States, 3 in Canada, 3 in Mexico, 3 in Burma, 2 in Siam, 1 in Cuba, 1 in Panama, and 1 in Honolulu. In total, there are 119 (in addition, there are Chinese Chambers of Commerce in South Africa, the West Indies, etc., which are not listed).</p>
<p>Educational Situation: As for the Chinese schools established by overseas Chinese in various places, there are 200 in Java, 80 in Sumatra, 60 in the Federated Malay States, 50 in Singapore, 32 in North and South Borneo, 20 in the United States, 28 in the Philippines, 18 in Annam, 10 in Celebes, 12 in Bangka, 10 in Tarakan, 8 in the Dutch Riau Islands, 8 in Dutch Belitung, 8 in Canada, 6 in Peru, 6 in Burma, 16 in Siam, 6 in Korea, and 3 in Tanah Datar. In total, there are 583 schools.</p>
<h3>Jiang Zuobin is Still in Jiangxi</h3>
<p>No Definite Date for Return to Shanghai</p>
<p>Most Outside Speculation</p>
<p>It has been rumored that the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Jiang Zuobin, will return to Shanghai from Lushan at the end of this month and go to Japan to resume his post in early next month. This reporter learned from sources close to Jiang yesterday that Ambassador Jiang went to Lushan with his family to escape the summer heat some time ago and has not yet returned to Shanghai. Recently, he received a letter saying that he would return when the autumn deepens. As for returning to Japan to resume his post, there is no news of it. The outside world is probably just speculating.</p>
<h3>Shenxin Factory Sues Dishonest Merchants for Counterfeiting</h3>
<p>"Limax" Brand Altered to "Ren Zhong"</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the "Ren Zhong" brand cotton yarn produced by the Shenxin Textile Factory was counterfeited by ten companies, including the Gongzuo Hosiery Factory and the Yongyuan Mercerizing Factory, who purchased "Limax" brand cotton yarn from the Japanese Daikang Yarn Factory and altered the brand to "Ren Zhong" in an attempt to profit. This is utterly unscrupulous. Shenxin has now obtained evidence, namely that after purchasing the Japanese yarn, these companies altered the old tax bills of Shenxin, changing the character "zhong" (鐘) to "鍾." Shenxin has now photographed all the evidence and submitted it to the United Taxation Bureau of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces for thorough investigation, and has also hired lawyer Sun Zuji to file a lawsuit demanding compensation for losses. Among the defendants are Yu Xifan, Chen Zhongxian, Wang Liwei, Sun Xinzhu, Yu Yuxin, Zhou Songmao, Chai Zhixiang, and the managers of Yongyuan Mercerizing Factory, Yi Yuhao, and Tonghe Dyeing and Weaving Factory. When this reporter met with lawyer Sun yesterday, he said that the complaint was limited by the Ministry's order and could not be disclosed in advance. In short, the complaint was submitted to the court last Tuesday and is expected to be heard soon.</p>
<h3>Compulsory Membership in Trade Associations</h3>
<p>Ministry of Industry Responds to the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Should Await Resolution by the Legislative Yuan</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government recently received a document from the Ministry of Industry, document number 19209, stating: "Your Municipal Government's document number 1492, regarding the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce's forwarding of a petition from 97 trade associations, including the Intestine Industry Association, concerning the issue of compulsory membership in trade associations, has been received. Upon investigation, the phenomenon of companies resisting joining associations and failing to pay membership dues occurs frequently throughout the country. This Ministry has already submitted a request to the Executive Yuan, which has been forwarded to the court for a solution. We should wait for the court's decision. The proposed methods of the trade associations need not be discussed. We hereby inform you of the above and request you to take note."</p>
<h3>Swedish Prince Expected to Arrive in Shanghai</h3>

He is scheduled to leave Kobe on the 27th on the Changxing Company's Empress of Canada and arrive in Shanghai on the 29th. Prince Carl's visit is purely for tourism and has no special mission. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has instructed the Foreign Affairs Office to provide all necessary hospitality. After a brief tour of Shanghai, the Prince plans to travel to the capital with the Swedish Consul-General in Shanghai, Mr. Senque, to meet with Chairman Lin and other important figures in the National Government, and then visit other places.</p>
<h3>Anti-War Conference Chairman Lord Marley to Return to Shanghai from Japan Tomorrow</h3>
<p>British Representative Hamilton Claims</p>
<p>Conference Date Unchanged</p>
<p>The Great American Evening News reported that Lord Marley, the chairman of the Shanghai Anti-War Conference, and Dr. Mardu, the Belgian representative, are returning to Shanghai from Japan on the Blue Funnel Line's Aeneas and will arrive on Friday. It is expected that Lord Marley will meet with Mr. Fessenden, the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council, after returning to Shanghai to frankly exchange views in order to dispel misunderstandings about the Anti-War Conference. A reporter visited the British representative, Mr. Hamilton, today (23rd), who said that the date of the conference has not been changed. Unless the leading representatives make a definite statement of rescheduling, it will still open on September 3rd, as previously announced. Mr. Hamilton declined to comment on current plans before Lord Marley's return to Shanghai but denied that the leaflets seized by the police were related to the activities of the conference.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Interior Sends Officials to Shanghai to Investigate Charitable Organizations</h3>
<p>Yu Qiaqing and Others Hold a Banquet at the Gong De Lin Yesterday</p>
<p>The Ministry of Interior, in order to reorganize international and public charitable organizations, has sent Cao Zhonglin, the section chief of the Fourth Section of the Department of Civil Affairs, to Shanghai. He first went to the Red Cross Society to inspect everything and invited Yu Qiaqing, the president of the society, and standing committee members Wang Xiaoting, Wen Lanting, Huang Hanzhi, Yuan Zhongwei, Yao Yuqin, and others to discuss plans for promoting the society's work. Then, he went to the Social Affairs Bureau to inspect everything. Led by the section chief of the Second Section of the Bureau, he inspected orphanages, vagrant vocational training centers, and other organizations. The president of the Red Cross Society, Yu Qiaqing, and others held a banquet at Gong De Lin at noon yesterday. Cao returned to the capital by night train that evening.</p>
<h3>Two Warships to Be Converted into Merchant Vessels</h3>
<p>Ministry of Navy in Consultation with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company</p>
<p>Jing'an: The Jing'an, a transport ship of the Ministry of Navy, has been deemed unsuitable for military use and a decision has been made to sell it. The Ministry is consulting with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to convert the ship into a merchant vessel for coastal operations, which would be quite suitable. Liu Hongsheng sent Zhou Houkun, the chief of the shipping department, to Beijing to inspect the ship. It was found that the Jing'an has a deadweight of 2,400 tons and more than 30 first, second, and third-class cabins, divided into four decks. The bureau initially planned to deploy it to the Beiyang route. A letter has been sent to the Navy, and experts will be sent to inspect the ship when it arrives in Shanghai from Beijing in the next day or two. If it is suitable for commercial use, the sale or lease will be discussed with the Navy. A decision will be made within a week at the latest.</p>
<p>Pu'an: The Pu'an is a ship operated jointly by the Ministry of Navy and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. Since its launch, it has been welcomed by passengers, especially during the summer season. At its peak, ticket sales on the Qingdao route reached 5,000 to 6,000 yuan. Since its launch, the operating income has exceeded that of other China Merchants Steam Navigation Company ships. According to regulations, there should be a surplus. However, the ship is old and requires frequent repairs. It needs to be repaired every one or two trips, and the cost of repairs is huge. After calculation, there is no profit to be made. Since the cooperation period expires on the 29th of this month, the bureau has notified the Navy to send personnel to Shanghai to discuss whether to continue the cooperation from January.</p>
<h3>Northeast Purchases Flour in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Chinese Native Cloth Also Shipped There</p>
<p>A Strange Story After September 18th</p>
<p>Since the Northeast was forcibly occupied by Japan, trade has been suspended because the puppet state imposes double taxation on goods. As a result, most merchants have stopped operating, and in recent times, the cargo volume of commercial ships sailing to Yingkou, Andong, and other ports in Shanghai has been only 10-20% of their capacity. Chinese commercial ships have therefore changed their routes, and even British commercial ships have reduced their schedules. However, in the past week, the Northeast has suddenly purchased a large quantity of miscellaneous grains in Shanghai, especially ordering a lot of flour. Chinese native cloth, which had been cut off from being transported to the Northeast since September 18th, has also started to be purchased in Shanghai. Today, the Taikoo's Andong ship leaving Shanghai has 45,000 bags of flour and 150 pieces of Chinese native cloth, as well as 300 pieces of foreign cloth, all loaded to be landed in Andong and transferred to Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces. These goods are subject to double taxation. Since the September 18th Incident, this is the largest shipment of goods from Shanghai to the Northeast. Even the shipping companies consider it a special situation. In addition, since the past ten days, the export business to the Northeast by the Dalian Steamship Company has increased sharply, but the company mainly transports cloth from Japanese textile factories in Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Change in Driving Time on the Longhai Railway After the Opening of the Shanghai-Ping Train</h3>
<p>The Longhai Railway Administration in Shanghai issued a notice yesterday, stating: "Now that the Capital Ferry is about to be completed and the Ping-Hu train is about to open, the train times of the Tianjin-Pukou and other lines have been revised. In order to facilitate connections, this line should also revise the train times of each line to facilitate travel. It is scheduled to take effect on September 1st. In addition to publishing the newly revised train timetable separately in the newspaper, this is a special notice."</p>
<h3>Foreign Merchants Suppressing Silk Prices Should Seek Relief from the Court</h3>
<p>The Commodity Inspection Bureau is Only Responsible for Inspection</p>
<p>The Xin Sheng News Agency reported that silk factories in the city often suffer from arbitrary picking by foreign merchants for the payment of futures, forcing manufacturers to deliver goods in pain. The silk industry association had decided a few days ago to ask the government to uphold justice. A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency visited Director Guo of the Silk Inspection Department of the Commodity Inspection Bureau yesterday to ask if there were any remedies for this situation. According to him, this kind of situation is a common dispute between merchants. When market prices fall, buyers often try to suppress prices by being picky in order to reduce losses and pressure the other party. Conversely, this situation would not occur. In theory, it concerns the poor morality of merchants, but the bureau has not yet received any reports of this. The bureau is only responsible for the fair inspection of the quality of the silk itself, and cannot mediate the buying and selling prices between the two parties. Therefore, if silk merchants encounter this situation in the future, the only remedy is to appeal to the court and ask the court to appoint experts to identify and judge right and wrong, so that this malpractice can be avoided. Otherwise, this kind of malpractice is really unavoidable. As for the quality of silk products in our country, it has been rapidly improving in the past two years after being inspected by the bureau. Although there is no proportional table to prove it, those who could not weave thin silk fabrics before have now achieved uniform and strong stripes.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council is Scheduled to Discuss the Budget</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Provisional Municipal Council will hold a meeting immediately to discuss the city's budget for the 22nd year, which has been submitted by the Municipal Government, as well as the land value tax issue and the reconstruction of the disaster area, as they urgently need discussion. Speaker Shi has scheduled the meeting and sent the agenda documents to the councilors.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Will Discuss the Method of Inspecting Factories in the Concession</h3>
<p>It is Not True that the Municipal Government Will Send Personnel to Attend</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that the issue of factory inspection in the Public Concession has reached a preliminary understanding after repeated consultations. However, the Municipal Council must make a decision through the board of directors, and the meeting on August 2nd did not discuss it. Then, it was adjourned for the summer vacation for one month, causing the issue to be postponed. The Municipal Government had to wait for development. It is now learned that the first meeting of the Municipal Council's board of directors after the summer vacation will be on September 6th, when the case will be discussed in detail, with Director-General Fessenden reporting on the consultation process and the agreed-upon methods between the two sides, and then the entire council will vote on whether to approve it. However, a member of the Ministry of Industry in Nanjing said that the Municipal Government will send personnel to attend, but a spokesperson for the Municipal Government clearly stated yesterday that this is not true.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Finance Sends Personnel to Collect Paper Money Tax</h3>
<p>According to banking sources, the Ministry of Finance, in order to increase national treasury revenue, will collect paper money tax according to the precedents of European and American countries. The tax is levied once a year, and the tax revenue from July 1st of last year to the end of June this year totals more than 3 million yuan. The Ministry of Finance sent Director Dai to Shanghai to collect the tax from various banks, including the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, based on their account books, and he returned to the capital yesterday.</p>

<h3>Russian Goods Imported into China Increase Sharply After the Resumption of Diplomatic Relations Between China and Russia</h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the import of Russian goods has become active. According to the data released by the Guidance Department of the International Trade Bureau, the amount of Russian goods imported into China in mid-June was alarming, ranging from one to dozens of times compared to the same period last year. Among them, the largest sales volume was printed foreign cloth, which increased by more than 20 times compared to the same period last year. The three Russian goods with the largest sales in China, namely kerosene, printed foreign cloth, and timber, are listed below. Cement, matches, and other items also had considerable sales.</p>

<h3>County Government Plans to Dredge Rivers Throughout the County</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government considers river water conservancy to be extremely important for farmland irrigation and boat traffic. It has been found that many rivers in various districts are heavily silted and need to be dredged separately. The Technical Office was ordered to draw up a county-wide river dredging plan. However, the county's construction funds are extremely stretched, and it is difficult to carry out the plan without raising additional funds. Therefore, the issue was raised for discussion at the 40th District Chief Meeting. As a result of discussions among the district chiefs, it was decided that the river dredging funds would be raised by levying a five-fen-per-mu tax on all fields in the county for a period of five years. As for the distribution of funds, it was decided to tentatively retain the plans of each district, and the plan was amended and approved. It will be submitted to the province for approval before being implemented. At the 163rd County Government Meeting yesterday, the case was again submitted for discussion. It was immediately discussed and resolved that the proposal and a summary of the plan should be issued to each district chief to be submitted to the district affairs meeting for discussion. The results of the meeting will be submitted for review and action.</p>
<h3>The Aviation Bureau Restricts the Load of Commercial Vessels</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Navigation Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that commercial vessels often face danger when carrying excessive cargo, has long intended to implement restrictions and regulations on load lines. When inspecting and measuring each vessel, the bureau will conduct inspections and strictly limit overloading to avoid danger. However, this matter is new to our country, and there are no precedents to follow. Therefore, based on the laws of various countries and referring to the domestic situation, the bureau is currently drafting regulations.</p>
<h3>The Chu You Warship Has Completed the Installation of New Guns</h3>
<p>Ho Erkun Was Buried Yesterday</p>
<p>Ho Erkun, who died on the spot in the Chu You warship gunnery test accident, was buried yesterday. The ship has also been equipped with new guns. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Burial: Ho's body was buried at 2:00 PM yesterday. All naval units stationed in Shanghai sent representatives to pay their respects. The hearse departed from the Chinese Funeral Home on Haig Road at 3:00 PM and was temporarily placed in the Minqiao Villa west of Xujiahui. The ceremony concluded at about 5:00 PM. Since Ho's family is in Fujian, in addition to the Ordnance Department sending personnel to take care of the funeral arrangements, the personnel of the Shanghai residence of Lin Xianxin, the director of the Ordnance Department of the Navy, also assisted in the arrangements. Minister Chen Shaokuan and Deputy Minister Li Shijia, who also served as the director of the department, sent wreaths.</p>
<p>New Guns Installed: According to a spokesperson for the department, the gun that caused the accident on the Chu You warship has been removed and replaced with a new gun, which has been installed. However, to be cautious, another test firing will be conducted in the next few days. Other guns will also be re-examined.</p>
<h3>Sun Ke Will Return to Guangdong</h3>
<p>Space Booked Yesterday</p>
<p>Sun Ke, the president of the Legislative Yuan, telegraphed Shanghai, reporting that after going to Xunyang and returning to the capital, he will come to Shanghai to escort Madam Lu back to her hometown. Therefore, his staff booked first-class passage on the President Jefferson of the Dollar Steamship Lines yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Xingye Trust Company Postpones Its Establishment</h3>
<p>The Xingye Trust Company, sponsored by the Municipal Government, in addition to allocating funds as a foundation and hiring directors and supervisors separately, was scheduled to be formally established on September 1st. According to Secretary-General Yu, the company decided to postpone the opening due to insufficient preparation. It is expected that it will be formally established in late September.</p>
<h3>Dismissal Measures for Workers at the Ministry of Communications Telegraph Factory</h3>
<p>Based on Years of Service</p>
<p>After the Ministry of Communications Telegraph Machinery Manufacturing Factory was ordered to close, Director Yu ordered subordinates to expedite the handover. Zhang Hongyuan, a technician and custodian of the factory dispatched by the Ministry of Communications, and Zhang Xinsheng, a clerk, have arrived in Shanghai and immediately went to the factory to meet Director Yu to discuss everything. It seems difficult for the Ministry to withdraw the order to dismiss the workers. However, the severance pay can be issued as much as possible. The standard for issuance is: for employees who have worked in the factory for more than one year, half a month's salary will be given as severance pay; for those who have worked for more than 15 years, six months' salary will be given uniformly to show sympathy. These measures are based on the precedent of the dissolution of the Ministry's printing house. The factory is currently busy handling the results, and all reports will be submitted by the end of the month. However, due to the large number of materials, it may be difficult to complete the handover in a short period of time. It is also heard that technicians with excellent performance may still be able to work in the factory when it is restored and expanded in the future.</p>
<h3>Sending Wang Delin's Family Back to Jilin</h3>
<p>The representatives in Shanghai of the former anti-Japanese General Wang Delin, Liang Yuanshan and Zhang Chuyu, stated that Xue Zhang, a section chief of the said army, adjutant Zhao Shen, and Zhao's family members, a total of four people, have been residing in Shanghai for a long time, which is not a good long-term plan. They plan to return to Jilin soon, but are lacking travel funds. Yesterday, they specially sent a letter to the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association for Northeastern Refugees, requesting financial assistance. The letter stated: "Respected Sirs, our unit's family members, including Section Chief Song Yunzhang, Adjutant Zhao Shen, and his aged wife Zhao Huangshi and son Zhao Shusen, a total of four people, have been stranded in Shanghai for a long time and are extremely anxious. We plan to return to Jilin in the coming days, and therefore specifically request your association to investigate and provide financial assistance. We would be extremely grateful." It is heard that the association has already prepared to issue ship tickets to Yingkou and will also allocate a certain amount of travel funds to each person to help with their expenses.</p>
<h3>Request for Temporary Tax Deposit Method for the Western Tobacco Industry</h3>
<p>The Shanghai, Nanjing, and Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Trade Association Joint Committee sent a telegram yesterday to the Jiangsu Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau of the Tax Affairs Department, saying (abbreviated title): "Recently, we received a letter from Yin Hunzhi, the representative of the Shanghai Western Tobacco Trade Association, stating that the new tax is excessively high, and the tobacco industry is suffering and finding it difficult to bear the burden. We requested consideration and assistance to provide relief and submitted a request to the Tax Affairs Department, which has been more than a month without a reply. Later, representatives were sent again to petition the Tax Affairs Department and the Provincial Bureau with the same request. As a result, the Tax Affairs Department and the Provincial Bureau sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations and found that the stone powder and tobacco stems contained in Western tobacco are indeed factual. However, it is necessary to wait for a reply from the Dutch province to examine whether it complies with the regulations and ordered our association that, before the Dutch telegram arrives, if it is necessary to pick up goods for sale, permission is granted to follow the tax deposit method. After the telegram arrives, a method will be formulated. Any surplus from the deposited tax will be refunded, and any shortfall will be collected. Our association believes that this method can barely be supported and immediately proceeded to handle the necessary procedures for tax deposit. After several days of effort, the procedures were finally completed, and funds were prepared for tax deposit. However, the Tax Affairs Department crossed out the words 'tax deposit' on the forms filled out by our association and ordered us to pay taxes according to the regulations, stating that the Dutch telegram had arrived and it was difficult to make concessions. Our representative requested to see the telegram but was refused permission. As small merchants, how could we dare to disobey? It has been found that goods from the producing area are taxed once for passage through seven provinces. If the tobacco merchant still appeals and petitions repeatedly, we are unable to acknowledge it. Our small-scale businesses have already paid the origin tax for Western tobacco, and yet a special tax must be added within the special zone. Compared to the aforementioned, it is like heaven collapsing! If the tax is not reduced and lightened, how can we possibly support it? Furthermore, Shaanxi and Gansu, like the seven provinces, belong to the national territory. Western tobacco merchants and tobacco merchants are both citizens of the country. The tobacco tax in the seven provinces is only levied once, while tobacco from Shaanxi and Gansu must be heavily taxed. Why are the merchants and people of Shaanxi and Gansu treated more favorably than those of the seven provinces? This is truly perplexing. At a time when the national finances are stretched, merchants who can afford to pay taxes will undoubtedly obey and contribute. However, the tax rate is too high and unbearable, not because we dare not comply, but because we lack the strength. Moreover, from the sowing of seeds to the growth of materials, and then to manufacturing, transportation, and sales in the Northwest, no fewer than hundreds of thousands of people directly and indirectly rely on Western tobacco for their livelihood. In recent years, the Northwest region has suffered from war, bandits, and successive droughts and floods. The people are suffering deeply. Western tobacco has already felt a great impact. The business situation is already precarious. If the tax is to the point of being unsustainable, how can the livelihood of hundreds of thousands of people in the Northwest be sustained? As the ancient saying goes, 'Compassion is in everyone's heart.' We hope that the Tax Affairs Department Chief will care for the country and the people, not just consider the interests of small merchants, but also consider the livelihood of the people in the Northwest, and the nation's vitality, adhering to the principle of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People. Our association intends to request your committee to petition the tax authorities to temporarily use the tax deposit method so that we can maintain our business. In this way, our merchants and the people of the Northwest will all benefit from the virtue of the tax authorities." We still beg for a reply, so that we may have something to follow. After the association examined the hardships stated by the members, since your department has already sent personnel to conduct on-site investigations and inquired by telegram to the producing area, the situation of the industry is already well understood. You can naturally approve as requested, temporarily using the tax deposit method, and make the telegram from the Dutch province public, discuss and decide on relief measures to show consideration and resolve disputes. According to the preceding letter, in addition to sending a separate telegram, a quick mail telegram is hereby ordered to be sent to be approved and the reply being sought to be passed on. Joint Chairman Chen Liangyu, Standing Committee Members Zhang Suhou, Qing Xunlu, Shen Xian of the Shanghai Business Association, and Joint Chairman Zhang Da and Standing Committee Members Yun Jiejie, Jin Jiayue, Dai Zhuo, and Chen Weiwen of the Shanghai Alcohol Trade Association kowtow together, and stamped.</p>
<h3>Approximately 21,000 Young Prisoners in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>Border regions are not included.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Judicial Administration previously telegraphed the high courts of various provinces to investigate the number of young adult prisoners sentenced to between three and fifteen years, so as to implement the plan to relocate prisoners to cultivate the border areas. According to news from the judicial circles in this city, except for the border regions, which have not yet submitted their reports, the inland provinces have now investigated and submitted their reports, totaling approximately 21,000 people.</p>
<h3>Reply from Jiangyin Street Merchants and Vegetable Vendors to Charity Organization</h3>
<p>Also, a document was submitted to the Municipal Government to request a halt to construction</p>
<p>Jiangyin Street merchants and vegetable vendors sent a letter to the Shanghai Charity Organization yesterday, stating: "In direct response to your letter, we have learned about your intentions. The construction of a vegetable market on Chezhan Road is your organization's idea because the residents in the Lujiabang area have increased, and the Jiangyin Street vegetable market is crowded, so you began planning. However, you are unaware that once the Jiangyin Street vegetable market is moved, the Jiangyin Street shops will inevitably close down. Does your organization not consider this? It is clear that this is not the original intention of charity. Even more so, Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People are the foundation of everything. Your organization's letter did not mention a single word about the shops. This is even more incomprehensible. The construction of the Chezhan Road vegetable market has a huge impact on the Jiangyin Street shops, and the impact on the shops is even greater than on the vegetable vendors. Therefore, the shops have joined forces with the vegetable vendors to oppose it and jointly elected Du Quan as their representative, repeatedly appealing and petitioning the party and government organizations, requesting the revocation of the order. The documents are still available and can easily be reviewed. The representative also represents the views of the shops and vegetable vendors, and especially the views of the shops, just like the Finance Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, etc., take the views of the Municipal Government as their own. Your letter asks for a registered representative, Du Jin, Sai Yu's fish stall, one vegetable stall, one new vegetable stall, etc. This may be the private action of Du Jin, etc. When registering, they did not use the name of a representative and cannot recognize Du's registration as representing the views of all the merchants and vegetable vendors. (Omission) However, Du Jinbao is not at home today and cannot be asked whether he registered or whether someone else took his place in an attempt to undermine public interests. As for Fan Gongliang, the representative, Fan is a merchant seeking to register a meat stall, but it is definitely someone else impersonating him, and he should be strictly investigated and punished. Even more shocking is what your letter says about Yan Hongxiang's father, Wen Yuan, and his fish stall. Although the representative Yan Hongxiang has an old father, his name is not Wen Yuan. We do not know what your organization is basing this on. However, upon investigation of this case (omission), the Construction Site Committee has not passed any resolutions or rejected it, and the Municipal Government has not approved or rejected it. How can your organization have already started construction? This is not only disrespecting the Municipal Government but also has the suspicion of deceiving oneself and others. Although the Chezhan Road vegetable market is said to be related to local public welfare, in reality, it intends to force all the shops on Jiangyin Street to close down and be in dire straits together. This is not the way of charity. Otherwise, why is your organization only concerned with the shops on Jiangyin Street?" In addition to submitting a report to the Municipal Government, this is a reply to the Shanghai Charity Organization. The merchants and vegetable vendors have also submitted a report to the Municipal Government, requesting a halt to the charity organization's construction.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Reports Assisting in Handling the Box Corpse Case</h3>
<p>The sensational Shanghai Box Corpse Case has been solved by the constabulary arresting the murderers.</p>
<p>Two Portuguese were arrested and sent to the Portuguese Consulate General for two preliminary hearings. The Municipal Government is paying close attention to this because the victim was Chinese. In addition to sending Councilor Luo Panhui to the Portuguese Consulate to observe the trial, the Municipal Government also instructed the Municipal Public Security Bureau to assist the concession police authorities in collecting evidence. It is learned that the Municipal Public Security Bureau submitted a report to the Municipal Government yesterday on the details of the case and important evidence. The Municipal Government authorities have not yet made any statement and will decide based on the outcome of the trial.</p>
<h3>Organizational Changes in the Railway Bureau's Car and Machine Departments</h3>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration Bureau, believing that the current establishment mostly follows the old system and is difficult to adapt to current needs, after consulting the situation, drafted an outline for organizational changes and submitted it to the Ministry of Railways for approval. This year, during the spring, the General Affairs Department was reorganized. Now, the organizational change measures for the Affairs and Mechanical Departments have also been approved. The Railway has issued orders to the two departments to assign duties to the existing staff in order to perfect the organization and ensure that everyone fulfills their responsibilities. The outlines of the organizational changes for the two departments are listed below:</p>
<p>Traffic Department: The internal organization of the Traffic Department was originally divided into three sections: Documentation, Dispatching, and Commerce. Now, the Documentation Section has been renamed the General Affairs Section, and the original four units of Documents, Personnel, General Affairs, and Archives have been changed to three units: Documents, Personnel, and Affairs. The original Archives unit has been merged into the Documents unit, and the General Affairs unit has been changed to the Affairs unit, in order to ensure that the general administrative system is linked to each department. The Dispatching Section is in charge of the traffic and transportation matters of the two railways, which are universally known as the Transportation Section. In order to align with the names of the various railways, it has been renamed the Transportation Section. The original four units of the section: Beijing-Shanghai Dispatching, Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Dispatching, Traffic, and Traffic Statistics have been changed to three units: Documents, Dispatching, and Traffic. The Commerce Section, which is in charge of the business matters of the two railways, has been renamed the Business Section and, based on actual needs, the original four units of Passenger and Freight, Public Transportation, Investigation, and Commercial Statistics, as well as the Catering Business Office, have been changed to six units: Documents, Passenger Transport, Compilation and Investigation, Public Relations, and Catering. The original Passenger and Freight unit and the Public Transportation unit have been merged into two units: Passenger Transport and Freight Transport. The Investigation and Commercial Statistics unit has been merged into the Compilation and Investigation unit. The above-mentioned changes have been approved by the Bureau and issued to the Traffic Department for active preparation in order to implement them when moving into the new building at the North Railway Station.</p>
<p>Mechanical Department: The names of the Mechanical Sections of the Mechanical Department have been redefined. The Beijing-Shanghai Line is divided into three sections: Beijing-Danyang, Danyang-Suzhou, and Suzhou-Songjiang. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Line is divided into three sections: Shanghai-Jiading, Jiading-Zhabei, and Caohejing. A Section Affairs Section is established to manage the mechanical affairs of each section, divided into four units: Documents, Locomotives, Vehicles, and Materials, to specialize in responsibility and facilitate command. The Documentation Section has been renamed the General Affairs Section, with three units: Documents, Personnel, and Affairs, to align with the organization of the Traffic Department. Each has set up one Document unit. The affairs of the machine shop, the affairs department of the electrical factory, etc., have been changed to Document units to facilitate communication. The above-mentioned changes have also been approved by the Ministry for trial implementation. The Bureau has notified the Department to take note.</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road Citizens' Association and New-New Company Investigate the Meisheng Soap Factory</h3>
<p>No inferior raw materials were used.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Nanjing Road Business Association, 1st District Citizens' Branch, after re-organizing the united brand certification to resist inferior goods in early summer, the inferior goods on Nanjing Road have been completely cleared out. Especially the procurement departments of the three major companies are particularly cautious in transferring goods. Yesterday, because the New-New Company sold this brand of high-grade soap, which was custom-made from the Meisheng Factory on Luban Road, but they did not know whether the raw materials used by Meisheng were inferior, they specifically requested the two associations, with their membership status, to investigate the internal situation of the Meisheng Factory on their behalf. The two associations commissioned Jiang Zhonglin of the Jicheng Pharmacy, Zhang of the Huamei Pharmacy, pharmacist Tu Fugui, and Chen Siyu, an employee of the association, to go to the Meisheng Soap Factory on the afternoon of the 22nd to conduct an on-site investigation. After a detailed examination, a report was sent to the association. The investigation revealed that the Meisheng Soap Factory is not large in scope. The raw materials used are from the industrial raw material vendors Dada Wude, Xiangji, etc. The names of the raw materials are as follows: Inner Mongolia caustic soda, Meizuishi blue powder, Tianjin and Huagong's bubble flower alkali, Heyifeng brand coconut oil, and butter, sandalwood, vanilla oil, balefen oil, soap yellow powder, etc. from the above shops. Although the origin of certain products cannot be proven, the situation of the factory suggests that it is a purely Chinese-owned organization and that there is no need to use inferior raw materials. After the Standing Committee of the two associations reviewed it, it has been forwarded to the New-New Company for reference.</p>

<h3>Haigao Road Completed Today</h3>
<p>Haigao Road, from Gaoqiao in Pudong to the seaside, could only accommodate rickshaws in the past. Since the Municipal Government established the seaside bathing beach, the number of tourists has increased daily. Therefore, the Municipal Government considered it necessary to expand it and allow cars to pass, so that tourists in Shanghai can go directly from the wharf to the seaside bathing beach. After construction began, it has been two months. It is heard that it will be completely completed this Saturday.</p>
<h3>British Police Court Heard the Case of a Russian Woman Killing a British Man Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Lefkin couple testified in court</p>
<p>The Dami Evening News reported that, in the case of Mrs. Hartley, a British Russian woman, being accused of murdering the British shipowner Youngers, the British Police Court continued the preliminary hearing today (the 23rd). The Lefkin couple, neighbors across the street, testified in court, explaining what they witnessed on the balcony at the time. The Lefkin couple lived at No. 17, Lane 178, Maohai Road. On the evening of the 16th of this month, they happened to be on the balcony of the second floor and could see the two rooms across the street. One room was dark and without light, and the other room was the back room, brightly lit. A man was sitting facing the balcony, and a woman was sitting to his right. At first, the two seemed to be talking. Then, they saw the woman holding a knife and smashing the porcelain on the table. After that, they saw the woman get up from her seat and stab the man with the knife. The stab was in the upper body. The man stood up from his chair and fell to the ground. Then, the woman buried her head in her hands, rested her elbows on the table, and appeared to be in deep thought. After a minute, she looked around and got up from her chair. She wandered around the room for a while before walking into the dark adjacent room. It seemed that she was still moving around. She had already asked Kreeski, who lived with her, to report it to the police. About two minutes later, they heard the police arrive. She followed them downstairs. Throughout, they did not see a third person in the two rooms across the street.</p>
<h3>Xiang Xiasheng, the Murderer in the Guiyang Road Shooting Case, Was Arrested</h3>
<p>Identified by the victim in person.</p>
<p>Also confessed to four accomplices.</p>
<p>Yu Azhuang, a Ningbo native residing at No. 24, Longshun Lane, Pingliang Road, also known as Yan Azhang, 21 years old, was shot in the back by an enemy near a remote section of Pingliang Road near Guiyang Road and fell to the ground. He was pushed into the river in an attempt to take his life. Later, Chinese Detective Chen Ling of the Yangshupu Police Station and Western Detective heard the alarm and rescued Yan and took him by car to the Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Detective Chen learned that the murderer had escaped to the house at No. 6, Huishan Road, and secretly went to surround it. Seeing that the front and back doors of the house were closed, he broke in. No one was there, thinking that the murderer had escaped over the roof. Later, it was learned that he had jumped out of the kitchen canopy and into the Lushuheng sand workshop next door. He immediately went to the workshop to inspect. A Ningbo native, Xiang Xiasheng, 28 years old, was lying asleep on the ground. There were mud stains on his shoes, which was quite suspicious. He was arrested and questioned, but he denied it. When asked about the workshop owner, he said that he was not a worker in the workshop. So he was taken to the police station. The police chief questioned him, but he resolutely denied it. He was taken to the Sacred Heart Hospital, where the victim identified him as one of the five murderers. He then lowered his head and confessed to the other murderers: Xun A'e, Chen Xi, Shan Biao, and Zhang Quan. The police chief ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police Lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated the course of events, saying that the defendant confessed at the police station that the origin of the case was that the victim had a pistol that he lent to A'e and Chen Xi to do illegal things. Later, when he asked for it back, he was refused. He was lured to that place by those people. A'e fired a shot at Yu's back, and he fell to the ground. Fearing that he would not die, Zhang Quan and Chen Xi pushed him into the river and then fled in a panic. The victim was seriously injured in the hospital. The bullet entered from the back and did not exit in the front chest. His life is in danger. Please detain the defendant temporarily and change the date, etc. When the defendant was questioned, he said, "I was invited by those people, but I did not do anything. I stood nearby as a lookout." His other confessions were evasive. Please consider this. Wu Zehan recommended that he be remanded in custody for a few days so that the victim's injuries could be verified again after he recovered.</p>

<h3>Gao Lansheng Arrested Yesterday</h3>
<p>French Police Announce Arrest</p>
<p>Yesterday, the French police sent a news item, which briefly stated that at noon today, the French police, in cooperation with the Public Concession police, arrested Gao Lansheng (also known as Gao A'gen) at the Cangzhou Hotel. This person was formerly the leader of a flower society, but the organization has now disbanded. Gao Lansheng is very famous in Shanghai. He is wanted by the authorities for a blood case and an assassination case. He often went to places such as Hangzhou, Hankou, and Yichang, so he was not arrested. After returning to Shanghai, someone attempted to assassinate this person a few weeks ago. Last October, someone attempted to assassinate Gao in Taiyuan Lane, Baliao Bridge Street, and Gao was shot in the abdomen. Later, Gao temporarily left Shanghai and then came to Shanghai again. The French police have been searching for Gao A'gen for several days. However, Gao often moved, so he was not arrested. The French police will prosecute Gao A'gen for various crimes in the Second Special District Local Court.</p>
<h3>Correspondence Between the Water Company and the Real Estate Association</h3>
<p>Water Leakage and Increased Water Prices</p>
<p>Requesting Notification to Landlords to Repair</p>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reported that the Shanghai Real Estate Association, for the matter of the statistical water meter prices, previously issued water usage record forms to the members and property owners, asking them to fill them out and report them for verification. Earlier this month, seventeen of these reports had been received, and a letter was immediately prepared and sent to the British Shanghai Waterworks Company for further study. The association has now received a reply from the Water Company. The two letters are recorded below:</p>
<p>Letter from the Real Estate Association to the Water Company: "Respected Sirs, enclosed are seventeen water usage record forms. Please check and receive them so that you can study whether there are any leaks, whether there is any misuse, or whether the limited amount is too low. We hope that you will provide prompt remedies."</p>
<p>Letter from the Water Company to the Real Estate Association: "We have received your letter of the 3rd of this month, along with seventeen statistical tables. We have carefully noted everything. The numbers listed in the table, such as the total number of houses, the amount of rent, and the water limit per house, are mostly consistent with what is recorded in our company's files. If we observe the numbers in the table based on the water volume recorded on July 1, we know that the actual usage generally exceeds the limited amount. However, this is not enough to draw a conclusion. We should first study where the water volume is being wasted. For example, if the limited amount is for household use, then non-household users should not be confused with it. This can be seen in user K-80 on the bill. According to the statistics in the table, the average number of people per house is five, and the average daily water consumption per person is 130.5 gallons. As a result, the monthly water bill reaches 25% of the rent. Upon inspection of the house, it was discovered that there was a large-scale nickel plating project inside. Secondly, the amount of water wasted due to water pipe leaks cannot be regarded as regular water use. This can be seen in user B-305 on the bill. In addition to household use, there is also a hot water stove selling hot water. The last inspection revealed that there were leaks in the faucets, with a total of twelve leaks in the small faucets. Furthermore, the increased water consumption in the summer months should also be considered. Generally, it is about 25% to 33% more than usual. User T-161 on the bill, the only one of the seventeen households listed in the water meter without leaks and who does not use water for non-household purposes, has a yearly usage that is generally not far from the limited amount. Also, five households in the table were stopped from supplying water earlier this year for refusing to pay the water bill. On that day, our company inspected the water facilities of each household and notified the landlords of the repairs that should be made. However, the landlords did not comply. It is our opinion that if your association can do its best to inform the members and ask them to repair the broken water facilities and not mix household water with non-household water, the statistical numbers will be more accurate, and the wasted water can be reduced. If we look at the current results, it is enough to arouse the user that most of the users who exceeded the quota are due to broken water facilities and the use for non-household purposes. Enclosed are seventeen tables. We are currently preparing to copy a copy. As instructed, we will deliver the original copies within the next few days."</p>
<h3>American Soldier Commits Assault, Kicks a Laborer, Who Falls into the River and Drowns</h3>
<p>First, a Kick, Still Not Satisfied</p>
<p>Continued Violent Kicking, Leading to a Fall into the River</p>
<p>|Three Laborers Witnessed the Event and Gave Consistent Testimony|</p>
<p>Chen Fusheng, a 23-year-old from Jiangyin residing at 95 Qianxin Street in the French Concession, worked as a dock laborer. On the morning of the previous day at 11:30 AM, he was hired by the American "Cheat-Shanghai" military camp at Xiaoshadu Road to transport grain to the Bund wharf on Guangdong Road. Chen and other laborers worked together to transport the grain to the No. 26 lighter berthed there. Then, they began to unload it onto the shore. Seeing scattered pieces of rock candy inside the boat, with no one paying attention, Chen couldn't resist temptation and picked them up, putting them into his pocket as his own. Unexpectedly, an American soldier named "Li Bo Si Ke" (transliteration), who was supervising the grain transport, noticed him. As Chen stepped onto the gangplank from the boat, the soldier suddenly searched him for the rock candy and kicked him. Chen immediately tried to dodge, but the gangplank was very narrow, making it difficult to turn around. After the first kick, the American soldier seemed unsatisfied and continued to pursue him. Chen couldn't run fast and was caught up, receiving more violent kicks. Chen couldn't withstand it and fell into the river. The rushing river water was swift and turbulent. Although others immediately tried to rescue him, they failed, and he joined the water spirits. It wasn't until the afternoon that the water police retrieved his body. They notified the general police station, which sent Deputy Detective Lu Dagong, along with detectives Li Wenshu, to the wharf. They questioned Xu Yongmei, Zhang Zhengxi, Gao A'niu, and other laborers who had worked with the deceased, about the circumstances of the American soldier's assault. The body was then taken to the forensic examination office on Fielun Road. Meanwhile, they went to the deceased's residence to investigate his family. According to the landlord, Fan Xiqing, Chen Fusheng lived alone in his house, and all his relatives were in his hometown of Jiangyin. The police reported the case to the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Prosecutor Guo was appointed to conduct the examination. After taking his seat, Deputy Detective Lu reported the investigation's progress and summoned all the witnesses, requesting interrogation. Prosecutor Guo interrogated Xu, Zhang, and Gao one by one. Their testimonies were consistent, all stating that Chen Fusheng had picked up some rock candy, about two or three pieces, inside the boat. The American soldier saw it and immediately took it away, kicking him. Chen was on the gangplank at the time and could only retreat. Unexpectedly, the American soldier chased after him and kicked him again, causing Chen to lose his footing and fall into the river. Although people tried to rescue him, they couldn't. The American soldier who caused the incident was also brought in for questioning. However, he only admitted to taking back the rock candy that Chen had picked up and denied kicking him. He also claimed that he didn't see Chen fall into the river. After questioning, Prosecutor Guo wrote the verdict, stating that the deceased, Chen Fusheng, had indeed drowned. According to the witnesses, the deceased drowned after being kicked by the American soldier, Li Bo Si Ke. The prosecutor had no doubts after the investigation. The police should file a lawsuit against the relevant American military camp according to the law. The body was handed over to Fan Xiqing to claim.</p>
<h3>Reasons for Delay in Construction by Landowners in the Central District</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, news from the Shanghai Central District Landowners Association indicated that the new Shanghai Municipal Government building was nearing completion. The move-in date for the Municipal Government and various bureaus was also approaching. Furthermore, the journey from Dixiwei Road to the central district took only six or seven minutes, making transportation relatively convenient. As a result, there had been a surge in requests for land. However, previous landowners were mostly waiting and reluctant to sell their land permits at the circled price. Therefore, the Land Bureau couldn't rashly issue land ownership certificates to new landowners. Thus, although landowners in the district wanted to start construction immediately, they were unable to due to incomplete procedures.</p>
<h3>Russian Oil Plummets After British and American Oil Price Cuts</h3>
<p>Cooperation Difficult to Achieve, Russian Oil May Fall Further</p>
<p>The major oil companies in China, such as Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, and Texaco, originally had uniform prices for their oil sales. However, after the Guanghua Company, acting as the agent for Russian "Oil Fields" (Oilex) products, implemented a state-run policy of undercutting prices, the business of British and American companies, such as Mobil and Asiatic Petroleum, was significantly affected. Consequently, they engaged in competitive price cuts, especially for gasoline, with prices dropping from $1.10 to $0.80. After July, the four companies seemed to have reached a tacit agreement in secret, ceasing to depreciate prices and engage in competitive sales. They jointly promoted the sale of "Oil Fields" products, but there was no real agreement or sincere cooperation. It was merely a temporary cessation of the business war. Four days ago, Asiatic Petroleum suddenly changed its listed price from $0.80 (per gallon) to $0.75. Initially, the Guanghua Company made no response. However, after its Director Li consulted with "Oil Fields" yesterday, they lowered the price from $0.80 to $0.65 yesterday, restarting the competition with the other companies. The company stated that it would not inquire whether Mobil, Asiatic Petroleum, and other companies would lower their prices further or whether they would negotiate with "Oil Fields." However, within a short period, it might consider reducing prices again within the realm of possibility.</p>
<h3>A Young Girl's Ignorance is Pitiful, a Scoundrel's Villainy Deserves Death</h3>

<p>Huang Qingxiang, a 32-year-old from Chongming, runs the Xinguang Chinese and Western Bookbinding Shop at 213 Changsha Road, employing several male and female workers. Zhu Zhang's daughter, A'e, a 17-year-old woman from Ningbo residing at 484 1/2 Wenzhou Road, also worked at the shop. Huang, seeing that Zhu was approaching womanhood and had attractive features, repeatedly tried to seduce her. However, Zhu knew that Huang was already married and refused. Huang then introduced Gu A'gen to her as a friend in February of this year, falsely claiming that Gu held a well-paying position at a large company and was unmarried. He told her that if she married him, she would have a good future. Zhu, young and naive, believed him. From then on, Gu A'gen often took Zhu out, to movies, or parks. The relationship became quite heated, and by April, Zhu's chastity was violated by Gu at the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Haig. Afterwards, Gu repeatedly invited Zhu to various hotels for intimacy, and they continued to have illicit relations. Unexpectedly, Zhu became pregnant. Fearing that her growing belly would be discovered by her mother, she discussed the matter with Huang Qingxiang. Huang took Zhu to a Chinese medicine doctor on Datong Road in Zhabei for an abortion. The doctor prescribed medicine, and Zhu took it. Two days later, Zhu had an abortion at home, but it was discovered by her mother, who realized that her daughter had been acting inappropriately. She questioned her sternly, and Zhu told her everything. Her mother was extremely angry, but Zhu had already lost her virginity to Gu and insisted on marrying him. Her mother contacted Huang, who then incited Zhu to run away from her mother. On the 17th of last month, Zhu, driven by lust, secretly left her mother and eloped to Avenue Haig, where she met Gu. They stayed at the Hongxiang Hotel temporarily and then moved to the Zhongnan Hotel in the French Concession, where they had illicit relations for several nights. At this time, Gu, for some reason, suddenly had other thoughts and lied to Zhu, claiming that he had been invited by a friend to go to another city on business and would give her $50 for expenses. He then left. Huang Qingxiang then led Zhu to the Yangshupu Jiangqiao Hotel, where they stayed for about seven days. Then they moved to the Hongxiang Hotel on Avenue Haig. That night, Huang forcibly raped her once. However, Zhu Zhang had reported her daughter's disappearance to the police and suspected that Huang was involved. She contacted Huang, but he denied any knowledge of the matter. Lacking evidence, she couldn't pursue the matter and could only search for her daughter. Finally, the previous day, she learned that her daughter was at the Hongxiang Hotel and reported it to the Xinzha Police Station. Detectives Lu Gendi, Bao Tan, Xu Dezhong, and Hang Faling went to find Zhu A'e. Zhu confessed that Huang was involved, so Huang was also arrested and taken into custody. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Huitang explained the situation, stating that he was filing a lawsuit against Huang under Article 257, Section 2 of the Criminal Law. However, the investigation revealed that the defendant may have committed rape and that Gu A'gen was on the run, so he requested a postponement to investigate further. Zhu Zhang and her daughter Zhu A'e then testified about the previous events. When questioned, the defendant Huang Qingxiang gave evasive answers and denied the accusations. Judge Xue verified the testimony and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody. The case was postponed for seven days for further investigation. Zhu A'e was taken back by her mother.</p>
<h3>"Small Coffin" Case Settled</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaomei, the famous Shanghai dance hall queen, filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Zhang Shuliang for damaging her reputation, with lawyer Wu Peng representing her. The defendant also hired lawyers Fan Gang, Chen Deming, and Xie Fanglin to defend him and file a counterclaim. After the case arose, both parties' friends intervened to mediate. The plaintiff and defendant also understood each other, clearing up misunderstandings and wishing to not pursue the matter further. The case has been settled. This afternoon, when the case was scheduled to open, lawyers for both parties prepared to appear in court to request the withdrawal of the lawsuit and counterclaim. A case arising from a small coffin was closed.</p>
<h3>Investigation of Illegal Detention</h3>
<p>Dong Zihua, the general manager of the Xie Da Xing Transportation Company on South Railway Station Road, was slapped and insulted by his neighbor Zhang Chuanqing a few days ago due to a minor matter. Dong filed a complaint with the Second District General Office for investigation. Later, Zhang, knowing he was in the wrong, asked many friends from the same village to mediate. Dong, respecting the mediators' wishes, didn't pursue the matter and Zhang formally sent a letter to Dong expressing his apology, settling the matter peacefully. Unexpectedly, at around 10 AM yesterday, Chen Ruijin, a former partner of Xie Da Xing, had a dispute with Zhang Chuanqing over another matter, which escalated into a fight. Zhang believed that Chen had previously worked for Dong and accused Dong of instigating the fight. He urgently invited his close friend, Han Zhenbang, along with several people resembling police officers, to rush to Xie Da Xing and arrest Dong. As they were being dragged away, Zhen Chengmao, a police officer from the No. 1117 post of the Railway Station Road Police Station of the Second District General Office, noticed them. He stepped forward to inquire and, seeing that the clerk didn't have orders from his superiors, questioned why they were privately arresting a legitimate merchant. He immediately took them to the station for investigation. However, Dong, feeling that he was unjustly detained, hired lawyer Yan to file a complaint against Wang and others for hindering freedom and other crimes, officially suing them in court. It was also heard that when Dong and Zhang first reconciled, Wang also signed the letter of apology from Zhang to Dong as a witness.</p>
<h3>Rickshaw Puller Parades Through the City, Recounting How His Wife Was Occupied by Another Man</h3>
<p>The Matter is Extremely Bizarre, the Situation is Pitiful</p>
<p>The Judge Strives to Uncover the Truth</p>
<p>Covered in White Cloth. Dong Zixing, a Ningbo native and owner of the Zhongmei Clock and Watch Company on Nanjing Road, had a concubine named Chen, with whom he had been involved for many years. This woman, now middle-aged, was previously identified by rickshaw puller Yin Changfa, a Tongzhou native, as his wife, who was occupied by Dong through deception. This led to a previous dispute, which was later dropped. Unexpectedly, the rickshaw puller's desire to find his former love and reunite with his broken mirror was strong. He brought up the old matter again, preparing a wide piece of white cloth, imitating the example of Huang Wushi, who sought justice for his daughter Wenying. He wrote down the entire story of his wife being occupied by Dong and then covered himself in the cloth, parading through the city, going to Dong Zixing's home at 13 Juxing Lane, Baike Road, hoping to see his wife and children. But the gates seemed as deep as the sea, and the room was near but the person was far. Yin's wishes were not fulfilled, and he became even more resentful. He then broke into the Zhongmei Company, causing a disturbance. Yin has now been arrested and taken to court. The matter is bizarre and interesting, truly rare. Yin's reasons for not fearing danger and wanting to fight with Dong for the woman are well-founded. Yin, in his mature years, works as a rickshaw puller. In the second year of the Republic of China, he was sentenced to eight years in prison by the Nanhui County Government for robbery. After entering prison, his wife, then young and deeply in love, visited him during family visitations. She told him that she was pregnant. Each time they met, Yin told her to take care of herself. In the third year of the Republic of China, Yin's wife gave birth to a son, whom she brought to visit him, asking Yin to name the child. Yin named him Mao (also written as Mao Luan). From then on, the family met briefly and separated. Yin always encouraged his wife to raise their son with hardship. Five years passed quickly. The woman never missed a visitation. Unexpectedly, after five years, Yin's wife disappeared from the prison, without any news.</p>
<p>Imprisoned, Yin thought of his wife and children, but was helpless. When his eight-year sentence ended, he discovered that his family was gone. He asked his neighbors, but none knew of his wife's whereabouts. At this time, Yin was destitute and homeless, so he came to Shanghai alone and resumed his rickshaw business. He worked hard until the 19th day of the Republic, when he saw a woman on the road who looked just like his wife. However, she was no longer dressed in simple clothes, but in fine clothes. He dared not recognize her rashly. He looked closely and found that she was indeed</p>
<p>His former wife. He thought he could reunite with her, overjoyed. He told her of his longing, but the woman turned away. It was said that those who were rich could easily change their wives, but now there was a case of changing husbands for wealth. This was unexpected. He followed her and, after discovering her whereabouts, repeatedly tried to communicate with her, but to no avail. The following year, Yin filed a criminal lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Dong Zixing, accusing him of occupying his wife and so on. The court rejected the lawsuit, as it did not meet the proper procedures. Yin, finding no justice in the court, continued to</p>
<p>Negotiate directly, but he could not win back his wife. Recently, he decided to expose the matter to society, seeking public sympathy. He spent his hard-earned money to buy a large piece of white cloth, writing down the details of how his wife and son were taken by Dong Zixing and placing it on his chest and back, parading throughout the city. At 9 AM on the morning of the previous day, he went to the Zhongmei Clock and Watch Company on Nanjing Road to reason with Dong, demanding compensation for his losses, several hundred gold pieces. However, Dong denied the assault and refused to be disturbed by Yin. He reported the matter to the local police station, who arrested Yin. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Special District Court, where Judge Qian Hongye presided over the hearing. Police lawyer Ru Baoyi stated that the defendant was</p>
<p>Causing disturbance and demanding money, which was similar to blackmail. He also accused the plaintiff of defrauding him of $430, requesting punishment according to the law. The plaintiff, Dong Zixing, testified that Chen was taken by him in the second year of the Republic of China, and their son was already 20 years old. Chen also testified, stating that she was 38 years old and had previously been married to Xue Ahua. Later, due to disagreements, they divorced and she remarried Dong. The defendant was her former neighbor and there was no marital relationship between them. She said that he was impersonating her husband. When Yin Changfa was questioned, he testified that the woman was indeed his wife and that Liu Tingrong, the owner of the Hongxing Shoe Store, was their matchmaker. However, Liu was now deceased. Judge Qian felt that the case required further investigation and ordered Yin to be remanded in custody for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Yang Qingxing, the Main Culprit in the Xiafei Road Red Pill Factory, is on the Run</h3>
<p>The Police are Conducting a Thorough Investigation</p>
<p>Three People Have Been Apprehended and are Being Held for Questioning</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the previous day at 2 PM, Jin Jiulin, the Inspector General of the French Police Special Agency, led detectives Zhang Ziying, Zhou Bingcheng, Jiang Changwen, Bao Tan Dai Rongji, Zhu Jutong, Xue Youlin, and others to raid an illegal red pill factory located on the third floor of 166 Xiafei Road. They arrested Chen Yushan (37), Shen Zhiming (22), and Xu Zhaochun (26), all from Guangdong, who were working at the factory. They were taken into custody pending investigation. The news was briefly reported yesterday. At the factory, they found 158 pounds of finished Tiger Brand red pills, 88 pounds of raw white powder, 35 pounds of unfinished gray pill material, six drying ovens, 100 lead boxes, one sieve, one large cloth bag for polishing pills, three ballboards, one set of magnetic grinding tools, half a bottle of chemical solution, two porcelain basins, 888 cloth bags for packing pills, five large and small ladles, 1,000 advertising papers, and 15 seals. According to Chen and others, the head of the factory was Yang Qingxing, a Chaozhou Dabu native, who lived in the lower wing of 3 Ziyang Lane, Geluoke Road. The detectives rushed to the address to arrest him, but he had already fled. In addition to sending detectives to watch, the police sent Chen and the other three to the First Special District Court this morning. Judge Wang Gangxu presided over the hearing. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahan stated that the police had not yet completed their investigation and that the main criminal was on the run. He requested a postponement to arrest Yang Qingxing and clarify the facts before filing charges. He presented the evidence. The court verified the report and questioned the defendants before ordering a postponement to August 30 for further investigation. The defendants were temporarily detained by the police and the evidence (a total of 19 items) was stored in the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Zhao Jinbao Sues Zhao Zhulin and Others for Property Encroachment</h3>
<p>Destroyed Evidence Worth 100,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Her Daughter, He Ying, Died Tragically as a Result</p>
<p>|The Judge Hopes the Two Parties Can Reconcile|</p>
<p>Zhao Jinbao, a woman from Suzhou, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Zhao Zhulin, Zhao Dianchen, Zhao Pingying, Zhao Yinnian, and Zhao Guoping, the five brothers who owned the Ruikang Paint Shop, for destroying evidence and attempting to encroach on her property. The lawsuit stated that the plaintiff's ancestor, Xiangcha, had three sons. The eldest was the plaintiff's uncle, Yuting (the defendants' father), the second was Baoting, who died early, and the youngest was the plaintiff's father, Jufang. During his lifetime, the plaintiff's ancestor had some property and invested in his eldest son to go to Shanghai to do business, opening the Ruikang Paint Shop. At the time, the European War was raging, and the paint business was extremely profitable. Not long after, the plaintiff's ancestor passed away. The family property was never divided and was managed by the plaintiff's uncle. He loved the plaintiff very much. When the plaintiff married into the Cheng family, things were initially prosperous, but later, the tea shop they opened became increasingly strained. In the second month of the lunar calendar in the 16th year of the Republic of China, the plaintiff's uncle returned to Suzhou to pay respects to his ancestors. The plaintiff asked him to help her son-in-law find a job. Her uncle agreed and allocated 100,000 yuan from public funds to help him revive his old business. The plaintiff was very grateful and repeatedly asked him to allocate the funds immediately. Her uncle said that such a large sum of money could not be handled immediately. If she was worried about future changes, he would give her a receipt as a guarantee. He immediately wrote a receipt with the words "allocated 100,000 yuan." The plaintiff cherished it. Unexpectedly, after the plaintiff's uncle returned to Shanghai, he fell ill and was bedridden. After a year of ineffective treatment, he passed away. The plaintiff was very sad and thought that the defendants disregarded family ties. Fortunately, she had the receipt written by her uncle, which they should acknowledge. She sent several letters, but they were ignored. The plaintiff was also ill and unable to come to Shanghai. On the 13th day of the third month of the lunar calendar this year, the defendants sent someone to Suzhou, claiming that if they had the old gentleman's (referring to her uncle) handwritten receipt, they could bring it to Shanghai to redeem the money. The plaintiff was seriously ill and unable to go. Her husband was also trading in other provinces. Therefore, she sent her young daughter, He Ying (just 15 years old), and her aunt, Li, to Shanghai with the receipt. She told them to be careful and, if they could pay some money first, they should ask her uncle (referring to the defendants) to remit the draft. They should return to Suzhou the same day. They arrived in Shanghai before the new year and visited the defendants' residence. However, the clerk firmly refused to let them in, saying that they could not convey any information without a letter. Unable to, they showed him the receipt. The clerk said that since they had</p>
<p>Written proof, he could deliver it for them. He took the receipt inside and did not come out for about an hour. He Ying was very anxious and was about to break into the inner room when two or three male servants came out and drove them away without asking questions. The old and weak women were unable to resist and left in tears, temporarily staying at the Jiang family's residence. He Ying was crying. Li told them about being driven out. The Jiang family repeatedly comforted them. They did not eat or speak and stayed overnight. They took the early train back to Suzhou. The Jiang family sent them to the station and saw that He Ying looked strange. When they checked at home, they found a box of red-headed matches under He Ying's bed. They worried that she had swallowed them. They reported it by letter. Indeed, He Ying could not speak when she arrived home. Her throat was rotten. She was sent to the hospital and died the next day. This was extremely tragic. Upon investigation, the defendants' plan was obvious. Their purpose was to avoid paying the money, so they used such a cruel method. She filed the lawsuit in accordance with Article 356 of the Criminal Law, requesting a judgment according to the law and a supplementary civil claim for 100,000 yuan. Yesterday morning, Judge Qian Chengjun opened the court hearing. The plaintiff's statement was the same as before. The defendants, through their lawyers, stated that they had only received the plaintiff's statement two days ago, so they had not had time to respond and requested a postponement of half a month for questioning. He also said to the defendant's lawyer that the case involved relatives and that He Ying's death was true, so it would be best to reconcile. The lawyer agreed to notify the defendants in order to proceed. The court then adjourned.</p>
<h3>Russian Man Gets Morphine Injection</h3>
<p>More Than Twenty People Arrested Simultaneously</p>
<p>The head of the French Damalu Big Self-Ringing Clock Police Station learned that there was an organization giving morphine injections on the upper floor of the chicken and duck shop at 139 Baoyu Lane, opposite the Cai Shi Street Market. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, he sent the No. 7 Western detective and several Chinese detectives to investigate. They found a Russian man getting an injection and many people inside smoking red pills. They were immediately arrested, totaling more than twenty people. Along with the lamps, guns, red pills, and morphine needles, they were taken to the office for investigation.</p>
<h3>The Entire Story of the Murder of Zhou Lao Wu, the General Newspaper Vendor of Both Routes</h3>
<p>Zhou Zengjia Forged an Enmity with Newspaper Vendors Over Security Deposits</p>
<p>Everyone Convened to Discuss Advocating Poisoning</p>
<p>|Tong Baoxing Released as Irrelevant, Xia Renliang Arrived to Confess|</p>
<p>Zhou Lao Wu, a Nanjing native and the general newspaper vendor for both the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway lines, was assassinated by enemies at 6:15 AM on March 22nd of this year at the entrance of Shanqing Lane on Elgin Road. Subsequently, Chinese and foreign detectives from the Dixwell Road Police Station arrested six suspects: Wang Gengsheng, Xu Abao, Shi Zusheng, Tong Baoxing, Yang Liangrong, and Wu Sibao. They were handed over to the First Special Court, which interrogated them twice. They confessed that Xia Renliang (also known as Chengliang), Pan Hongsheng, Gao Amao, and others were also involved, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Xiao Xiefen continued the trial in the Third Criminal Court. Defendant Xia Renliang, seeing the newspaper reports implicating him, hired lawyer Chen Tingrui to surrender himself and join the defendants. Thereupon, police lawyer Zhang Tianyin stated that investigations during the adjournment period had revealed that defendant Tong Baoxing was not involved and requested his release, which the court approved. It was also stated that defendant Shi Zusheng was acquainted with all the other defendants.</p>
<p>Xia Renliang Was the Former Manager of</p>
<p>All Newspaper Distribution for Both Routes at the Minsheng Society. The deceased Zhou Lao Wu and others were all newspaper vendors for the society, but they were required to obtain licenses with a security deposit of sixty yuan, paid monthly. However, after the January 28th Shanghai Incident, business was slow, and the newspaper vendors were unable to pay on time, resulting in significant losses. Xia then feigned resignation to the Railway Bureau, and Zhou Lao Wu seized the opportunity to take over, renaming it the Daily Newspaper Association, with all newspapers, large and small, distributed by him. However, when Xia was in charge, there were nine licenses, divided into three categories for nine newspaper vendors: A, B, and C. A paid sixty yuan, B paid eighty yuan, and C paid ninety yuan. The previous sixty yuan was already difficult to maintain, and the recent increase meant that all</p>
<p>Newspaper Vendors Made No Profit, Leading to Widespread Unemployment. All harbored resentment towards Zhou. Xia Chengliang regretted resigning. Around February of this year, Shi Zusheng, Yang Liangrong, and Pan Hongsheng were drinking tea at the Laifenglou teahouse on the Boundary Road when Xia suggested murdering Zhou. Shi agreed, saying it required money. Xia offered to find a way. Shi then asked Wu Sibao to find two strong men, who then enlisted Wang Gengsheng and Xu Abao. The second discussion took place in early March, again with Xia and the others</p>
<p>Gathering at Laifenglou. Xia asked Shi if he had found anyone. Shi replied that he had two men. Xia then gave Shi one hundred yuan for expenses and promised a reward of three hundred yuan if the deed was done. Shi first paid Wu Sibao twenty yuan. The next morning, Shi led Wu to Laifenglou to identify Zhou Lao Wu's face, as Zhou went to the teahouse at nine every morning. On March 16th, Wu bought two sharp axes from an iron shop and gave them to Shi to hide at home. Shi then led Wu to Zhou's residence at number two in the fifth lane of Shanqing Lane, telling him to go to Shi's house at five the next morning (the 19th) to get the axes and distribute them to Wang and Xu, each to wield one, and join Shi and Gao Xiaomao</p>
<p>Guarding the Boundary Road. Zhou did not appear. At 5 PM, Shi, Yang, and Xia returned to Laifenglou, where Xia gave Shi the remaining two hundred yuan. The next morning at 6 AM, Shi gave Gao Amao, Wang, Xu, and others five yuan to buy snacks. That evening, Shi and Gao went to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Inn on Huaxing Road in Zhabei to discuss the plan in a room. At 5 AM the next morning, Wu went to Shi's house to get the axes and give them to Wang and Xu, guarding Zhou on the Boundary Road, but they still did not meet. On the morning of the 22nd (the fourth attempt), at around 6 AM, Wang, Xu, Wu, Gao, and others finally encountered Zhou in Shanqing Lane. They went forward and blocked him with wooden clubs. Wang and Xu</p>
<p>Began the Attack. Zhou's copper-basin hat was struck four times, with one blow hitting flesh, causing him to fall to the ground in agony. They continued to strike several more times before fleeing. At 3 PM that afternoon, Shi met Gao and Wu at the Town God Temple in the city and gave Gao one hundred and fifty yuan. On the afternoon of April 4th, Shi and Gao were at the Hongfu Teahouse on Sangyuan Road in the city, where they gave Wang and Xu six yuan each. After Wang, Xu, Shi, and Wu were arrested, police officers escorted them to the scene of the crime to demonstrate how the murder had been carried out. After Zhou's death, Xia, Yang, Pan, and Tong maintained the business, drawing up a contract, which, along with the felt hat and axes used in the attack, were submitted to the authorities. Zhou Lao Wu's wife, Li, complained that since her husband's death, her child was only seven years old and</p>
<p>Could Not Inherit His Father's Business, so she entrusted her son-in-law, Yang Liangrong, to cooperate with Xia and the others, giving her seventy yuan each month. Her husband and Xia had no prior animosity. All funeral arrangements and the reporting of the search for the murderers, including the reward, were handled by Yang, and there were drafts that Xia signed. She also stated that Shi Zusheng had been a newspaper vendor for her husband but was fired for misconduct, accumulating resentment. Since her husband's death, he had never visited. Questioned about this, Xia Chengliang, a 31-year-old Suzhou native residing at number 21 Ningkang Lane, Zhejiang Road North, stated that the Minsheng Society was founded by Chen Keming on January 1, 1911, in collaboration with the Railway Bureau. Both he and Zhou were managers. Zhou profited from the sale of major newspapers on trains, while Chen profited from small newspapers. He was responsible for investigating accounts. Due to the impact of the Shanghai Incident and the expiration of the contract, Zhou took over the business and renamed it the Daily Newspaper Association. After Zhou's death, he helped to maintain the business as a friend of Zhou's and denied any involvement in plotting Zhou's murder. Judge Xiao verified the confessions and ordered the defendants to be detained and remanded for further questioning.</p>

Lumber and other materials were burned, with an estimated loss of several thousand yuan. The fire brigade rushed to the scene and extinguished the fire by 11:05 PM.</p>

<h3>Passenger Commits Suicide by Jumping into Huangpu River from Municipal Ferry</h3>
<p>Yesterday at 4:30 PM, a municipal ferry traveling between the 16th Pier, Dongmen Road, and Pudong had just returned to the east side of the river from Puxi with passengers. When it reached the center of the river, a young man suddenly jumped into the river to commit suicide. The crew of the ferry immediately stopped to try to rescue him, but the man did not resurface and drowned. It was discovered that he had left a suicide note on board. The ferry then sailed to Pudong and handed the letter over to the police officers, who took it to the Third District. The contents of the letter stated: "Since the closing of my shop, I have had bad luck. My wages are not enough to support my elderly mother or my wife and children. The deity I worship cannot help me. It is pointless to live. I hope kind-hearted people will deliver this letter and advise my mother, sisters, and wife not to grieve." The envelope was addressed to Fu Ji Barbershop upstairs at the Wanlichun Teahouse, 16th Pier. Director Zhang immediately dispatched police to Pudong to summon the deceased's brother-in-law, Wang Yongtian. According to him, the deceased was Zheng Entao, 26 years old, from Yangzhou, and worked as a barber. He had likely committed suicide due to economic hardship. The district director ordered the immediate dispatch of people to recover the body and arrange for burial.</p>
<h3>Boy Injured by Freight Truck</h3>
<p>Yesterday at around 5:11 PM, near Xiaoshadu Yaoshui Lane in West Shanghai, a freight truck with concession plate number 9719 and municipal plate number 3717 was speeding south when the driver, due to a moment of carelessness, knocked down a boy, Lu Qiwu, who was standing by the side of the road. The wheels ran over his abdomen, causing the skin to break and bleed, and he immediately fainted. A police officer saw this and immediately rushed forward. Seeing that the injured boy was in critical condition and barely breathing, he immediately took him to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road for treatment. At the same time, the driver, Hu Yingbin, and the truck were detained in the Sixth District for investigation.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau Director and Yu Xunlu, et al., Reach Settlement in Lawsuit</h3>
<p>Yu Xunlu, Huang Wenqing, Jin Yunjie, and others of the Shanghai-Nanjing-Suzhou Tobacco and Alcohol Joint Executive Committee had a proposal at a temporary meeting on July 12th that contained various misunderstandings regarding Huang Yong (号裕明), the director of the Shangbao Tobacco and Alcohol Branch Bureau. Huang believed that this damaged his reputation and filed a private prosecution, which had one hearing. Now, Chen Liangyu, Zhang Dalian, Shen Weiting, and Li Guangzhen acted as mediators. Both sides have reached an understanding. Yu and the others will withdraw the proposal and notify all members to correct it. At the same time, Huang will withdraw the lawsuit to maintain the old friendship. A misunderstanding and dispute has come to an end.</p>
<h3>Dahua Cooperative Society Holds Founding Meeting</h3>
<p>Zhanghuabang is located about three miles south of Wusong Town, where the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Machinery Factory and the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau are based. Two thousand people work at these two major factories, most of whom rent houses in the small villages near the factories. However, the area has no formal businesses, and daily necessities must be obtained from Shanghai and Shanghai, which is very inconvenient. Li Ran, an employee of the Huangpu River Conservancy Bureau, realizing this, contacted twenty-eight like-minded people to initiate the organization of the Dahua Cooperative Society, with the goal of self-solving the needs of life. Since May 28th, they have been working on the organization. As more and more people joined the cooperative, they decided to build a three-room clubhouse on the east side of Zhanghuabang Station, which has recently been completed. On the afternoon of the 20th of this month, the founding meeting was held at the Rotary Elementary School under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Railways. The weather was clear that day, and guests included representatives from the Wusong Municipal Committee, the Seventh District Public Security Bureau, and others who came from Shanghai from afar, making it a grand event. The four walls of the meeting hall were hung with congratulatory messages from various circles, which were dazzling and beautiful. The "Heaven Helps Those Who Help Themselves" brocade from Chen Ya夫 and the "Wisdom, Benevolence, and Courage" silver shield presented by Dr. Shen Sixian to Li were particularly eye-catching. The meeting began at 3 PM as scheduled. Li Ran, Cai Rongfu, and Xin Caiyou were elected as the presidium, and Gao Shuxun was the recorder. Li Ran, the director of the preparatory committee, reported on the preparations. Tong Boya, a representative from the Seventh District Public Security Bureau, delivered a speech, hoping that the employees of the society would organize themselves strictly, pay attention to the interests of the members, and become one of the model cooperative societies in the country. Next, the fifty articles of association were passed (omitted). Next, the staff was elected, and the staff swore an oath of office, with the Public Security Bureau acting as the ballot supervisor and oath administrator. The elected directors included Li Ran, Cai Qinshu, Yang Yunqing, Xin Caiyou, Tang Ren, Zhou Dianliang, and Hu Xiangxian. The supervisors were Zhou Xiongcai, Chen Fuliang, and Gao Shuxun. Next, photos were taken, refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned. The society also distributed towels as souvenirs.</p>
<h3>Municipal News</h3>
<p>Recent News from the China National Products Company.

<h3>Important Proposals at the 18th Annual Meeting of the Chinese Science Society</h3>
<p>Organize a Committee to Investigate and Utilize Sichuan's Resources</p>
<p>Improve National Medicine and Establish an Agricultural Committee</p>
<p>(Chongqing Airmail) This time, members of the Chinese Science Society came to Sichuan to hold the 18th annual meeting. Liu Xiang, the Sichuan Reconstruction and Rehabilitation Supervisor, believes that Sichuan Province urgently needs to develop various mineral deposits and other scientific undertakings, which are extremely numerous. Therefore, he not only expressed a warm welcome to the majority of experts from the society who came to Sichuan for the meeting, but also sent personnel to take care of the scientists' food, lodging, and recreation. On the 17th, all members of the society, in order to express their gratitude for Liu's warm welcome, specially elected the society's directors Bing Nongshan, Yang Yunzhong, Zhou Zijing, and Wang Jiliang as representatives. Accompanied by Yu Zhiheng and He Beiheng, the receptionists designated by the Supervisor's Office, they went to the Supervisor's Office to meet Chief of Staff Guo Wenqin and Chief of Political Affairs Gan Diankui. First, Mr. Guo, representing Supervisor Liu, expressed his welcome, saying that all members are national scholars and experts who have come to Sichuan from afar for the meeting. This coincides with the time when Sichuan's military and political affairs are about to be unified. Although Sichuan is remote, it is rich in natural resources. However, due to unstable political situations and undeveloped human resources, if the political situation can be unified in the future, he hopes that the majority of experts from the society will provide guidance on the overall construction of development, production, and cultural enhancement, such as how to design and implement it. Then, Mr. Bing Nongshan spoke, saying that the society members were very grateful for the grand reception from the Supervisor's Office, which provided many conveniences. Sichuan is vast and its scenery is beautiful. It is hoped that political unity will be achieved and construction will be carried out as much as possible. In the future, the society's members will continuously pay attention to Sichuan's construction and contribute their humble opinions. If specialized talents are needed, they will certainly be introduced to work in Sichuan. Afterwards, the guests and hosts engaged in discussions for about an hour. Mr. Bing and others then returned to Bazhong School. At 4 PM, Mr. Bing gave a lecture at the Sichuan Normal School. At 6 PM, the Supervisor's Office officially hosted a banquet at Taoyuan to welcome the society members. On the 18th, they took a special boat to Beibei, arriving at 11 AM. They rested and bathed at 1 PM, and held a society affairs meeting at the Western Academy of Sciences in Beibei at 4 PM. At the same time, various important proposals were discussed. It is learned that the proposals put forward by Hu Guang, Wu Liande, and others are recorded below.</p>
<p>Investigate Sichuan's Resources. Hu Guang proposed that the Sichuan Provincial Government organize a Sichuan Resource Investigation and Utilization Committee. (Reasons) Sichuan is vast and rich in resources. Its agricultural, forestry, mineral, and water resources are the richest in the country. However, due to years of war, capital outflow, and the inability to carry out various construction projects, the people's livelihood has declined and the economy has collapsed. He spoke with great emotion. In the past, although academic research institutions such as the Geological Survey, the Biological Research Society, the Jing Sheng Biological Investigation Institute, and the newly established Western Academy of Sciences have conducted incidental investigations in purely scientific research, they have not been on a large scale and purely from an economic perspective. This is also due to the unfavorable environment. Now, fortunately, unification is expected, and the people of Sichuan are eager for governance. This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. The members of the society, who have come to Sichuan to hold the annual meeting, should, in order to develop China's industry and to repay the hospitality of the Sichuan government agencies and academic organizations, propose to the Sichuan Provincial Government to organize a Sichuan Resource Investigation and Utilization Committee. The Sichuan Provincial Government should determine the amount of funding to be allocated each year. The society can introduce experts to Sichuan to conduct various investigations, such as mineral, water, soil, agricultural, and forestry resources, over a period of five or three years. The findings of each investigation should be compiled into a report, with detailed designs attached, for the use of the Sichuan Provincial Government and entrepreneurs. In the future, if the various projects are implemented in order, the society can also be responsible for introducing technical personnel. If Sichuan's construction can take this as an arrow, then it will not fail the society's purpose of promoting science. Is this appropriate? Please decide publicly. Co-signers: Yang Jishu, Zeng Shen, Hu Boyuan, Hu Fu, Ma Jiwei, Xu Nanzhao, Lai Shanding, Sheng Zhao Hua, Du Changming, Bing Zhi, Sun Changpei, Li Changpian.</p>
<p>Improve National Medicine. Wu Liande proposed to request the government to improve and reorganize national medicine with pure scientific talent. (Reasons) Since the development of science, the most closely related to social people's livelihood is medicine. Therefore, in the past 100 years, the progress of medicine in various countries has been rapid, all thanks to science. China's social culture is backward, and its thinking is complex. Its understanding of science is particularly weak. This is evident in the current state of medicine. The trust in science will never reach a sincere level if the relationship between one's own life and death is not governed by the pragmatic and fact-seeking science. This is the greatest danger to the future development of science. It is necessary to actively promote it to correct the social direction and enlighten the public. Recently, there has been a desire to have people without scientific training in charge of improvement and reorganization. This is a manifestation of society's disregard for science. Such actions will not produce any results. If this precedent is set, then all scientific undertakings in China can be entrusted to laymen, and the matter can be considered settled by simply adding the four characters of "scientific method." Therefore, it is appropriate to request the government to quickly select medical talents with scientific knowledge, scientific surgery, and scientific cultivation to reorganize the matter, so that the effectiveness can be seen and the national essence can be developed. Co-signers: Ye Shanding, Lu Yutong, Ma Xinyi, Bing Zhi, Zeng Shen, Hu Guangxiao.</p>
<p>Establish an Agricultural Committee. The Chinese Science Society should organize an Agricultural Committee to promote Chinese agriculture using scientific methods. (Reasons) China is an agricultural country. For thousands of years, it has operated agriculture and has considerable experience. However, it does not know how to apply scientific methods, so the effect of improvement is very small. Compared with European and American countries that apply science to improve agriculture, the difference is far greater. Recently, the import of foreign agricultural products to China has increased year by year, and the outflow of resources is huge, which shows the backwardness of Chinese agriculture. Its impact on rural society and the national economy is of great importance. Now, those who talk about saving the country all regard improving agriculture and reviving rural areas as the key to maintaining national survival. The Chinese Science Society has a considerable mission to undertake this task. It should organize an Agricultural Committee within the society to promote the development of Chinese scientific agriculture. Is this appropriate? Please make a public decision.</p>

<p>Two Strange News Items of Spring and Autumn</p>
<p>Zhanlu</p>
<p>The President with Ten Thousand Sons</p>
<p>The Saint of Sex in China</p>
<p>Who is the head of state in the world with the most children? In ancient times, it was of course King Wen of Zhou with his "one hundred sons." In recent history, Emperor Hongwu of the Ming Dynasty and Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty also had many sons; however, they only had a few dozen at most. As for having ten thousand sons, there is only one unique case: the current German President Hindenburg, who deserves a thumbs up. This is a recent strange story.</p>
<p>Who is the new saint in China recently? It's not Saint Kang; he's already passed away. Nor are they Saints Dong or Hu; the titles of Saints Dong and Hu are just something people made up, not self-proclaimed. The saint I'm referring to now is someone who calls himself a saint and has it in official documents, with solid evidence, claiming, "I am a sage by nature." Who is this person? The former Doctor of Sex, now the Saint of Sex, Zhang Jingsheng. This is also a recent amusing story.</p>
<p>Hindenburg's many sons are not his biological sons but adopted sons. Because since the war, Germany has suffered from a decrease in population, Hindenburg advocated for efforts to increase the population. For every family that raises a sixth son, that son is recognized as the President's adopted son. With such encouragement, the German population has increased sharply. Hindenburg's sons have gradually increased, reaching more than ten thousand. They are all the eighty-four-year-old President's godchildren, truly deserving of "many blessings, long life, and many sons."</p>
<p>Although the Book of Odes has the line "All say, 'He is a sage!'" those who call themselves saints are rare. Confucius did not dare to consider himself a saint. When Mencius heard his disciples regard him as a saint, he said, "Alas! What words are these?" Dr. Zhang Jingsheng, originally from Raoping, Chaozhou, is currently the Director of Industry in Raoping, where his afforestation and road construction efforts have achieved considerable results. Last week, someone, using the name of the Raoping Improvement Association, accused Zhang of ten crimes, including harming public morals. Zhang was furious and sent a telegram to defend himself, stating, "Jingsheng has been immersed in the good manners of our country since childhood. Now, after more than forty years, I believe I can maintain self-discipline with propriety. In recent years, I have broken through the difficulties that ordinary people cannot overcome in terms of sexuality. Therefore, I dare to say that I am a sage by nature," and so on. Yi Yin was the Sage of Responsibility, Boyi the Sage of Purity, and Liu Xiahui the Sage of Harmony. After thousands of years, we now have Zhang Jingsheng, the Sage of Sex. As the old saying goes, "When a sage appears, the Yellow River will be clear." Now that there is another Sage of Sex, how could the Yellow River flood into Jiangsu? The old sayings are not credible, so it is.</p>
<p>The Struggle of Two Sexes</p>
<p>Qifeng Louzhu</p>
<p>Improving women's rights, advocating for women's professions, and demanding women's independent living - these kinds of slogans have been shouted loudly in society for a long time, so I don't need to add to the noise. Don't you see? There are female section chiefs and clerks in government offices, female principals and teachers in schools, female typists and shop assistants in large companies, as well as female lawyers, female reporters, female detectives, and, furthermore, female barbers, female waitresses, female actors, dancers, massage girls, flower girls... It's impossible to list them all. There are now so many female professions in society. It seems that almost all the jobs that men used to do have now been replaced by women. Isn't this the glory of the female world, the progress of society, and a good phenomenon for the country?</p>
<p>Since women's professions have developed, women's rights have naturally expanded. However, in terms of livelihood issues, they have clashed with men. Men's original positions have been shaken. In the end, a deformed society is often driven by novelty, worshiping women and abandoning men's jobs, replacing them with women. Poor men will feel the pain of unemployment! Although the number of unemployed people in our country has not been accurately investigated, it must be very alarming! This is also one of the reasons for the struggle between the two sexes.</p>
<p>In fact: whether women's work performance is superior to men's is certainly a question? However, comparatively speaking, they seem to grasp the word "calm." As for "knowledge" and "experience," who is better than whom depends on each individual, and it is not easy to make a definitive judgment. In short, the struggle of two sexes will become more intense in the future! If men and women have equal abilities and similar academic skills to seek a job, I believe people will definitely welcome women and hire them, while despising men and rejecting them! I make a more neurotic prediction: judging from the current social situation, in a few decades, if men do not have special skills and extraordinary talents, they may find it difficult to stand on the stage of life and compete with women.</p>
<p>Random Notes on Trinkets</p>
<p>Zeng Shu</p>
<p>Clear water in the desert is a lifeline for travelers; the flood from a breached dam is a burial pit for disaster victims. A stern scolding and a gentle reprimand are lighthouses in your darkness; you must not mistake them for hostility!</p>
<p>The taste of love is sweet, but after marriage and the creation of love's offspring, you will naturally feel the spicy and astringent taste.</p>
<p>Money is omnipotent! It can make everything in the universe submit and worship under its power; but sometimes it is very timid and subject to people's domination and driving, which is really strange!</p>
<p>Life is just like a drama, and the world is like a stage; we chase in the waves of the sea of people, just see if you are playing a tragedy or a comedy?</p>
<p>Talking about "Three"</p>
<p>Xingzhi</p>
<p>I have not specialized in the six scripts of Chinese characters, such as indicative, pictographic, associative, transferred, or phonetic loan characters. I do not know how the character "three" was created. However, from my personal point of view, the shape of the character "three" is very neat, perhaps because of this, it is very pleasing and often found in speech. However, whether the character "three" is good or bad, auspicious or ominous, I have not figured out since the three northeastern provinces were transferred without a fight. Perhaps the character "three" has both good and bad meanings.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen invented the Three Principles of the People, which uses the character "three." It is said that foreigners have great faith in it. This character "three" can be said to be extremely glorious. Confucius, the old sage, said, "Of the three unfilial acts, the greatest is having no descendants." This "three" certainly cannot dominate the world like the "three" in the Three Principles of the People, but it is made for our country's clothing racks, and shares the same purpose as one of the Three Principles of the People: nationalism, which is to increase procreation. Therefore, the "three" in "three unfilial acts" is still basking in the glory of the Three Principles of the People.</p>
<p>Heaven, earth, and man are called the three powers; Xia, Shang, and Zhou are called the three dynasties. Xia Yu, Shang Tang, Zhou Wenwang, and Zhou Wuwang are called the three kings. Fuxi, Shennong, and Huangdi are called the three emperors; the sun, moon, and stars are called the three lights; in the Spring and Autumn period, Mengsun, Shusun, and Jisun are called the three families; the father's clan, mother's clan, and wife's clan are called the three clans; the Jin people sealing one's mouth and being cautious in speech is called the three silences. Mencius's mother moved three times to educate her son. Other examples include the Three Character Classic, the three obediences of the three obediences and four virtues, the three lives of good fortune, and the three cases of the Ming Dynasty: the Tingji Case, the Red Pill Case, and the Moving Palace Case. The three bonds of ruler and subject, father and son, and husband and wife all show that ancient people liked to use the character "three" very much. There are also the three religions of Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism; the three heroes of Zhang Liang, Xiao He, and Han Xin (Zhuge Liang, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei of Shu Han are also called the three heroes); mountain farmers, marsh farmers, and plain farmers are called the three farmers; the three rites of the Zhou Rituals, the Book of Rites, and the Book of Etiquette; the three commentaries of the Zuo Zhuan, the Gongyang Zhuan, and the Guliang Zhuan; the three Tong of the General Records, the General Records Continued, and the General Examination of Literature; and the three Su of Su Xun, Su Shi, and Su Zhe. All of them have "three" in them. The wide application of the character "three" can be seen.</p>
<p>When Qin Hui of the Song Dynasty falsely accused Yue Fei of a crime, Han Shizhong asked Qin Hui, "What crime did Yue Fei commit?" Qin Hui only replied with the three words "莫须有 (mò xū yǒu)", which means "perhaps there is," leading to Yue Fei's death. Later, the three words "莫须有" were used to describe falsely accusing the innocent of a capital crime, and many people still use "莫须有" to lament Yue Fei.</p>
<p>Doing things poorly by imitating is called "three-legged cat." European firearms, printing presses, and compasses are called the three great inventions. There is also the triumvirate of Rome, the separation of powers of legislature, judiciary, and administration, and the triangular love that is prevalent in modern times. The Indian "阿在 (ā zài)" on the road and the tramp's respectful name "小瘪三 (xiǎo biē sān)," all of which are the most popular "three" in modern times, are comparable to the "three" in ancient times.</p>
<p>The things named with "three" can be said to be countless, but under today's circumstances, we must not speak nonsense and should be cautious in our words!</p>

<p>Zhao Weng laughed heartily in the house, and the laughter reached the courtyard outside. Guizhi sat on the kang in her own room, smiling continuously. After a while, Jiang returned. As she pushed the door open and entered, she saw Guizhi sitting cross-legged on the kang, looking up, smiling slightly. Even when her mother came in, she paid no attention, still looking up at the ceiling, constantly showing a smile. Jiang, after all, was a conservative person, and when she saw this situation, she disapproved somewhat in her heart. She said to Guizhi sternly, "Did you go to the backyard just now?" Guizhi blushed and said, "I heard laughter and talk in the backyard, very happy. I couldn't guess what it was, so I sneaked a peek. What's wrong? Did that make you unhappy?" After speaking, she puffed up her cheeks and lowered her eyelids. Jiang smiled faintly and said, "That's good. You're like Zhu Bajie, blaming me before I blame you. I haven't said anything, but you're blocking me with words. Fine! I won't care about anything anymore." Jiang, in a fit of anger, Guizhi did not get angry again but laughed with a "poof." Jiang sighed and said, "What can I say to you? I'm afraid Zhao's family will hear it. Young people these days? Sigh!" She sighed heavily and sat down to one side, smoking her dry tobacco pipe. That night, Guizhi felt that something was wrong with herself, and she did not dare to argue with her mother. She went to bed herself. At noon the next day, Guizhi was coming back from buying things on the street when she saw Company Commander Guan with a thoughtful look on his face, heading straight for the house. He didn't see her, so Guizhi didn't disturb him. She hurried home and hung down the old curtain in the inner room. The weather was already slightly warmer, and Jiang was washing clothes in the room below. Only Company Commander Guan Yaowu was heard calling in the courtyard, "Is Auntie at home?" (167)</p>
<p>Random Thoughts While Sweating</p>
<p>Zhu Lu</p>
<p>Although autumn has quietly arrived on earth, the heat of the day still has not lessened; the thermometer often rises above eighty degrees. If people move to do something, sweat will have long secreted from the skin. Yes, a group of hard-working laborers are still bathed in the exchange of sweat all day long, pursuing the food of life. This Random Thoughts While Sweating is a work I struggle to obtain for food.</p>
<p>These days, watermelon has gradually become an out-of-season fruit; however, the Dangou melon produced in Changshu still maintains its inherent position. This kind of melon has a white skin, white flesh, and white seeds, so it is also commonly called the Sanbai watermelon. The flesh of the watermelon is crisp, sweet, and juicy, truly a wonderful product for quenching thirst. In addition, peaches and lotus roots are also seasonal fruits these days. The lotus root of Suzhou is originally very famous. This kind of lotus root is produced in the lotus root marshes ten miles outside Fengxi Gate, as thick as a leg and as white as powder, with a unique flavor. This year, the rural areas have declined, and everything is cheap. Lotus roots are only selling for about 200 copper coins per catty, which is really cheap for a group of gourmets. Suzhou also has several gardens that produce peaches. The tender honey-colored fruits are slightly covered with a layer of carmine. The color is so delicate, and the sweet taste makes people's mouths water.</p>
<p>Flat peaches are also a kind of peach, round and flat in shape, like a small plate. Some of the pits are even exposed on the outside. It is said that the peaches that bloom for three thousand years and bear fruit for three thousand years in Yaochi are this kind of flat peaches. Eating them can make people live forever. Although this is a myth, the taste of flat peaches is indeed good. However, because they are produced in small quantities, they are also expensive. Compared with honey peaches, they feel rare and precious. Begonias, grapes, and jujubes have also come to the market together. The bright colors are like colorful clouds and piled up like colorful brocade; yes, this is the season for golden plates for begging for skills and the Cowherd and Weaver Girl crossing the river.</p>
<p>Jasmine, called Anmo in Cantonese and Molihua in Buddhist scriptures, exudes a rich and intoxicating fragrance in its white petals. The fragrance becomes more intense in the evening. This kind of flower is most popular with women. They are tied into round flower balls with silver threads and hung on the lapels of light gauze shirts. Whenever the moon rises over the willow trees and a breeze brings coolness, the rich fragrance of the flowers, mixed with the fragrance of grease and powder, is darkly sent over. In this situation, I really don't know how many men are drunk and how many young people are turned upside down!</p>
<p>When it gets hot, clothes always have to be taken out and exposed to the sun; relying on the heat of the scorching sun, the moisture in the clothes is removed to prevent mold and insects. When exposing clothes to the sun, there are also some small pieces of common knowledge; when drying colored clothes, a single shirt must be covered on the outside to prevent the clothes from fading or changing color when exposed to sunlight. Leather clothes are especially afraid of being directly exposed to the sun; otherwise, the luster of the leather will gradually decrease and become withered. After the clothes are dried, they must first be cooled in a shaded place, and then the wrapped camphor or tea leaves should be placed in the clothes and stacked in a box together to avoid moths and hair loss.</p>
<p>The passage of automobiles has become a hot and fashionable problem in Suzhou. Opposition and support, disputes and disputes. To be fair, driving cars on the narrow streets of Suzhou is indeed not the time. However, Suzhou is a famous scenic spot, but the scenic areas, because of the rugged roads and inconvenient transportation, do not have the attraction of Hangzhou and Mogan Mountain. Now, Zhu Mengmei has suggested building highways and driving cars in scenic areas. It is said that this suggestion has been deeply approved by people. The Shihu Rectification Committee is preparing to build a highway at the foot of Mount Shangfang. The Xingchun Bridge on Shihu Lake is being rebuilt into a new-style bridge with cement and steel frames. In addition, the Wanniang Bridge outside Xu Gate is also preparing for a reconstruction plan.</p>
<p>In recent days, autumn wind and autumn rain have gradually felt tender and cool, especially in the morning and evening. I think that in the near future, the autumn air will gradually deepen and the coolness will gradually thicken. The general coolies will not taste the bitterness of the exchange of sweat again. Whenever the chirping of insects sounds from outside the window onto the pillow, thinking of the poem "The sound of insects newly penetrates the green gauze window," my soul cannot help but receive deep comfort.</p>

<p>Shen Bao National Goods Weekly National Goods Forum Mr. Wu Zhihui and the "Two Hundred and Fifty" National Goods</p>
<p>Yang An</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui, who is used to telling witty remarks, recently sat upright and sang the great theory of "Motorcycle Saving the Country," his words were so grand that the lesser Confucians were speechless. The New China Magazine even published a special issue on motorcycles to promote it. The first article is Mr. Wu's masterpiece, encouraging motorcycle saving the country, with meticulous care. He even said that when Chinese people are fascinated by this, they should be like opium addicts, mahjong habitués, men, women, old, and young, with thoughts in their hearts, speaking of them, and hoping for airplanes. Only Chinese people are the most skilled, and can continue this honor for hundreds of years. In the World Encyclopedia, the term "Chinese Flying" can occupy many pages. When I read his article, my heart pounded. However, in the article, he even ridiculed the national goods of the motherland. He said that when foreign goods are flooding and the economy is on the verge of bankruptcy, we should use the "two hundred and fifty" national goods to counter them. He also said that with a nation accustomed to manufacturing "two hundred and fifty" national goods, and displaying handicrafts in the market that are as crude as the items in a mortuary, when will we be able to help the self-manufacture of airplanes?</p>
<p>Mr. Wu may have been too busy running around in politics recently and has not had time to investigate the current situation of the national goods industry and the progress of machine-made crafts. Otherwise, not only would his words not match the truth of our country, but they would also be too disrespectful to the national goods industry, which has been diligently managed with great effort. In the recent five or six years, our people have not been content to be a nation accustomed to manufacturing "two hundred and fifty" national goods. Everyone has put their minds and efforts into creating machine-made national goods. They have sacrificed countless energy, countless time, and countless money, and finally, the four characters "Chinese National Goods" have begun to emerge in the era of industrial competition. All the products in terms of clothing, food, housing, and transportation are self-sufficient, without the need to seek from abroad. Not only are there no crude items like those in mortuaries, but there are also many products that are already comparable to European and American crafts and have surpassed Japanese goods. For example, what is the durability of the Huasheng fan compared to European and American goods? What about compared to Japanese goods? May I ask, can a nation that is truly "two hundred and fifty" manufacture such national goods? Are these national goods really items in a mortuary? Facts speak louder than words. Mr. Wu, why don't you take some time from your political affairs to investigate them? I wrote this article because I am afraid that the people in our national goods industry will suddenly become discouraged upon hearing this statement, and I am even more afraid that Mr. Wu's words will be spread around, enough to hinder the enthusiasm of the Chinese people to engage in national goods. Therefore, I made an explanation to encourage the Chinese people who are enthusiastic about national goods.</p>
<p>Talking about National Goods</p>
<p>Current Status and Future of National Goods Production and Sales</p>
<p>Xuan Wan</p>
<p>The path ahead for our national goods industry is fraught with thorns and hidden reefs. Although we have been working diligently and courageously over the years and have achieved many glorious results that we can be proud of, foreign intrusions and the impact of trends are still coming without stopping and even intensifying. Recently, our national goods have suddenly suffered from the problem of sluggish sales, and the shadow of overproduction is repeatedly cast on the opening scenes of various national goods factories. Although it is said that in a year of economic downturn, everything in society is declining, so how can our national goods be immune? But to seek the truth of everything, we must first conduct a detailed investigation, and then we can start to implement rescue methods.</p>
<p>The obvious facts tell us that the current reason for the decline of national goods is that production is higher than consumption, the so-called "supply exceeds demand," and production and sales cannot be balanced. The reason for the imbalance is the two points that we urgently need to pay attention to:</p>
<p>1.  Foreign goods are dumped, taking away our national goods market, especially the detestable enemy goods, which do not hesitate to change their appearance, impersonate national goods, evade tariffs, and engage in various illegal activities, only seeking low costs and implementing their dumping tactics. According to the customs report for last month, the import of enemy goods into the Yangtze River coast has suddenly increased two times compared to the previous month, and its impact on the sales of our national goods is self-evident.</p>
<p>2.  Rural areas are bankrupt, and the inland social economy has collapsed, and purchasing power has plummeted, making it impossible to sell national goods.</p>
<p>Based on these two points, we can deeply understand that under this situation, it is wrong for national goods factories to only maintain their lives by "reducing labor" or "lowering prices." The current plan to treat the symptoms is to first find ways to prevent the dumping of foreign goods, especially to strictly inspect the situation of enemy goods, increase tax revenue, and prevent rampant activities. Second, it is the factory's own problem, how to use more inland raw materials, strive to reduce costs, lower prices, and cater to the psychology of the Chinese people. With this response, we can then wait for the inland economic recovery and the thorough awakening of the Chinese people, and the solution to the fundamental problem of not using foreign goods.</p>
<p>Being familiar with the current situation and hoping for the future, production and consumption are the two cornerstones of the social economy of any country. If our national goods manufacturers regard increasing production as the most important goal, then we must not ignore the consumption aspect. Increasing consumption is the way out for production. We must naturally strive to eliminate all obstacles that hinder consumption, so that both production and sales can progress and be absolutely balanced, so as to gradually reach the path of "production and sales cooperation."</p>

<p>My Country's Machine-Made Toothbrush Industry</p>
<p>Huai Cheng</p>
<p>Toothbrushes are daily necessities that everyone needs, and their needs should be directly proportional to the reproduction of the population. But in our country's situation, generally speaking, except for those who have a little common sense of hygiene, most inland people often think that this is a close to a luxury and not a very necessary supplies, and even that brushing their teeth is a troublesome task. So, the two sides of production and sales are not very developed.</p>
<p>The toothbrushes sold on our country's market are divided into handmade and machine-made types. Handmade toothbrushes are available everywhere, and Foshan, Guangdong, is the source. Machine-made toothbrushes are shipped quickly and have advanced machinery. The Jianzhi Factory, established in 1920 with a capital of 20,000 yuan and using a deer's head as a trademark, began manufacturing it in a progress factory. Its founder is Mr. Shen Tianjuan, the current manager of the Xinxin Factory. At that time, Japanese goods were rampant, and the newly established industry was oppressed by the environment. There were many difficulties, and after two years, it was transferred to the Jiangwan Model Factory to take over. After Jianzhi, in 1921, the Shuanglun Toothbrush Factory was organized, with more capital and a larger scale. Although it has undergone several changes, its products are still sold on the market. Later, Liang Xinji, a Cantonese businessman who had always operated handmade toothbrushes, also followed suit and switched to machine manufacturing. In 1925, the Yixin Toothbrush Factory rose up. Manager Chang Xincheng was one of the founders of the Shuanglun Factory. He has considerable experience in manufacturing. Therefore, its products are excellent and widely sold. From then on, the "Sanitary Toothbrush", a notoriously dumped enemy good, gradually became less common.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, there are eight machine-made toothbrush factories in China, two in Shanghai, two in Tianjin, and one in Beijing. Now, I will introduce them one by one below to see the achievements of this industry:</p>
<p>(Eight in Shanghai) Yixin Factory, Yixin Brand. Shuanglun Factory, Shuanglun Brand. Xinxin Factory, Xinxin Brand. Tianjin Factory, Tianlun Brand. Nikko Company, First Brand. Zhenyu Factory, Hulu Brand. Home Factory, Home Brand. Liang Xinji, Shuangshi Brand.</p>
<p>(Two in Tianjin) Tianshengyu Factory, Tiantan Brand. Hengshun Factory, Xingzi Brand.</p>
<p>(One in Beijing) China Sanitary Toothbrush Factory, Wei Zi Brand.</p>
<p>It is estimated that the total output of the above factories is about 700,000 to 800,000 pieces per month. This is far from the population. However, recently, various factories, in view of the downturn in the market and the sluggish sales, have mostly tended to reduce production.</p>
<p>As for handmade toothbrushes, because they have a considerable history, they are also widely sold, and their output is more than machine-made toothbrushes. Imported goods still occupy a large share of the market. British, American, and German goods are well-made, but their prices are very high, more than double the price of domestic goods. Chinese people should break the psychology of worshiping foreign goods and switch to buying domestic goods. Japanese goods often use miscellaneous brands to impersonate our country's national goods and sell them on the market. Buyers are easily deceived by them. Those who love to use domestic goods should pay attention to this.</p>
<p>Observation Notes</p>
<p>Visit to Baoshan Paper Mill</p>
<p>Hu Xuwu</p>
<p>The Battle of Baziqiao is an important page in the history of the January 28th Incident. Among them, the crumbling walls and broken walls shrunk under the setting sun. Looking back at that time, the noise of vehicles and horses is heartbreaking. The Baoshan Paper Mill is one of the dangerous nests, and it is the only remaining large fruit, like Dong Yimou. Yesterday evening, with the introduction of Mr. Huang Peizhang, I went to visit with Mr. Huang Wangping. First, I visited Director Zhang Renshou. Mr. Zhang is from Ningbo, with a square face and bright eyes, dressed as a worker. He said that the factory was established in 1928 with a capital of only more than 100,000 yuan. He was in charge of the factory from the beginning. From the purchase of the site and the construction of the factory to the installation of the machinery and the recruitment of workers, he did everything himself. Years ago, he managed diligently, and the paper produced was well-received by society. Large bookstores such as Commercial Press and Zhonghua Bookstore even had long-term contracts, and every day the supply could not meet the demand, and there was no concern about sluggish sales. Therefore, he had never published a business advertisement in the newspapers. During the January 28th Incident, the residents of Zhabei fled far away to avoid the disaster. I (Mr. Zhang referred to himself) believed that it was not easy to build this factory. Destroying the factory was tantamount to destroying myself. Therefore, I lurked in the factory for more than a month. I was blessed by God, and the factory survived fortunately, and I was also unharmed. After the agreement was initially finalized, the Japanese army had not yet been completely withdrawn, and Zhabei was like a dead city. I spent a day and night repairing the motors and cleaning up the boilers. So, smoke billowed during the day, and electric lights flashed at night. The Japanese were surprised. During the conversation, he led us to visit various parts of the factory, such as the machine room, the electric room, and the material room, which were all well-organized. Mr. Zhang carried out the conversation, explaining the transformation of the machines and the matching of materials, guiding us through the key points, as if counting his treasures. Mr. Huang Wangping, who accompanied us, was a mechanical scholar, and was also very impressed by this. We thought that the factory foundation was solid and the products were excellent, so we asked why he did not set up an office in Shanghai to seek development. Mr. Zhang said with emotion that after the January 28th Incident, a downturn enveloped the whole city. This factory has always adopted a tight policy. Even if I personally consider it, the internal management of the factory, the external contacts, and the chemical and engineering technologies, which would require four or five people to handle in other factories, are all concentrated in myself in this factory. Therefore, it can be supported in the depression of the market and the competition of the same industry. If you want to seek development now, you must raise shares. However, in Shanghai's financial circles, there are people who invest in real estate, but few people invest in industry. Since there is no guarantee of raising shares, the business cannot be developed. Since the business cannot be developed, the establishment of an office will only increase the factory's consumption. The current plan is only to work hard and seek a way out in a difficult situation. After the candid conversation, he nodded and left. I think that the Baoshan Paper Mill is a "saved from death" national goods factory, and Mr. Zhang is an industrialist who "puts himself in a dead place and then lives." Therefore, I wrote down his story to commend him. Mr. Zhang may not regard it as a useless addition.</p>
<p>Opening of National Goods</p>
<p>Zhang Mengfei</p>
<p>This year, we are happy to celebrate the National Goods Year. The people's love for the country is the most important thing. Chinese and foreign people live together in Shanghai. Which commercial port can compare with its prosperity? Every time the lights come on, the streets are lively and connected. People often like foreign goods, which makes the country weak and the people poor, which is really pitiful. It is difficult to calculate how much money is leaked out, which makes people sigh like suffering. Therefore, Chinese people advocate Chinese goods. National goods markets are set up everywhere. They often use words to promote it. What is most hateful is that some people like to use Japanese goods. They do not remember their grievances and are greedy for cheapness. They earn our money and make guns and cannons. Their evil hearts are like arsenic. I hope my compatriots will wake up quickly and not be as infatuated and drunk as if they were sleeping. If you can make up your mind to resist, learn from Goujian who slept on firewood and tasted gall. I guarantee that the Japanese slaves will go to the Yellow Springs to die. Commercial competition is the era. Any style is valuable and new. You should know that the economy has been invading us for years. It is more victorious than martial arts by tens of thousands. From now on, never use foreign goods. Avoid leaking money to the outside. I advise you not to just pay lip service.</p>
<p>Zhang Junmengfei is good at composing storytelling. Recently, when broadcasting current affairs on the Greater China Radio Station, it is new and precise. It is well received by society.</p>
<p>National Goods Poetry</p>
<p>Shopping at the National Goods General Store</p>
<p>Xiaobai</p>
<p>Under the red lights shining in the New Year, I stepped into our great National Goods General Store. As soon as I looked up, I saw lovely flowers and birds welcoming me. The pair of solemn bronze lions also seemed to be showing a slight smile.</p>
<p>○ ○ ○</p>
<p>In the magnificent shopping mall, there are new national goods everywhere. Customers are crowded, and shop assistants are busy. This is full of the prosperity of national goods.</p>

<p>I went from the north to the south, and then visited a 99 shopping mall. Everything was indeed cheap. I chose several kinds that I needed and came out very satisfied.</p>
<p>National Goods News</p>
<p>Talking about National Goods Soap and Medicated Soap</p>
<p>Xiao Min</p>
<p>In addition to producing household soap, Wuzhou Guben Soap Factory also produces various scented soaps and medicated soaps. Because these products are all made using indirect methods, they are very effective in practical use! Let me describe them one by one below.</p>
<p>There is a distinction between coarse and fine for scented soaps and laundry soaps, and the manufacturing methods are also slightly different. Because laundry soap focuses on removing dirt, scented soap focuses on fragrance and quality. There are various scented soaps on the market: high-priced foreign goods, shoddy inferior goods... Customers often suffer losses in careless situations. Therefore, the necessary conditions for choosing scented soap are: rich fragrance, fine material, and economical value. Guben national goods scented soap fully meets the above conditions. It now has dozens of kinds, such as Beauty, Orchid, Rose, Sandalwood, Laurel... all are real, beautiful, and good national goods scented soaps.</p>
<p>Medicated soap is a bit different from scented soap. It is most beneficial to the skin. For example, if a person has skin disease, it will affect his appearance, but medicated soap can make up for this deficiency. In the past, medicated soap was only imported. Later, Chinese people were able to make it themselves, and the medicated soap refined by Wuzhou was not inferior to imported goods. Guben medicated soap is divided into China Sanitary Medicated Soap, Honey Iron Box Medicated Soap, Red Sanitary Medicated Soap, Green Kede Shah Soap, and dozens of other kinds. Regular bathing and washing can eliminate all kinds of skin diseases and can make the skin go to the path of health and beauty.</p>
<p>In order to develop industry and commerce and promote national goods, the Fujian Provincial Government has specially launched a National Goods Exhibition. It has selected Fuzhou West Lake Park as the venue and scheduled it to open on Double Ten Day this year. The Shanghai Municipal Council Commodity Exhibition Center received a letter from the exhibition recently! Please collect products from Shanghai ports on their behalf and transport them to Min to display them to show the grand occasion. It is said that the office has replied to the preparatory office of the association that it will be collected on their behalf.</p>
<p>The Shanghai four groups previously held the National Silk and Satin Exhibition, which was grand in scale, rich in products, and widely publicized throughout the country. The Hunan Provincial National Goods Exhibition Hall sent representatives to visit the meeting, who were very satisfied. Later, they sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce Exhibition Hall requesting representatives to collect small samples from various factories and transport them to Xiang to display them to promote them.</p>

<p>Moths and China</p>
<p>Qifan</p>
<p>Moths have a particularly good relationship with us Chinese people. Peel a fresh, red, and lovely peach, as radiant as a young girl's face. Take a bite, and a pit full of brown sand appears, filled with plump, healthy moths. Upon closer inspection, there are tiny holes in the peach, but at first glance, no one would think that this treasure is cultivated inside.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, nine out of ten peaches have moths. At most, peach moths only make me afraid to eat peaches. There is nothing to hate or blame. But who says it is limited to peaches? Among all the fruits in China, no one can escape the harm of moths, unless they bear fruit early, like plums, taking advantage of the climate where it is not easy for moths to</p>
