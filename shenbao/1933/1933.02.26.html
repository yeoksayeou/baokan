<h3>時評</h3>
<p>四十二對一晦</p>
<p>（一）國聯之威信</p>
<p>日本蠻横。僞國奇醜。凡審知中日衝突之内容者。莫不歎爲歷史的怪劇。而内田康哉以慫動九一八事變之主角。入任外交總長。由和平的橡皮［玩偶］進而爲軍部禦用之鋼鐵傀儡。其强硬無理。眞不愧爲日本軍國主義之忠實代表。其輕蔑公理蹂躪東北三省。以爲現世界皆應日本一國獨步。必殺盡中國人以顧全其所謂生命線。我國雖始終退讓。然而世界各國。已大爲不平。國際形勢。已大轉變。</p>
<p>十九國委員會草竣報告書之後。日本帝國主義進熱河。窺伺灤東。擾亂華北之陰謀。益加顯露。在我國被害已深。萬難再事隱忍。起而爭戰。自在意中。奮力抵抗。尤爲公理中之公理。而英法各國。無論爲國聯之威信。爲國際間之均衡。皆不能再事遷延。任日本鐵蹄踏碎東亞。也是故本月二十四日之國際聯盟大會。經再度審愼考量熟權利害之後。乃不畏日本退出國聯以威脅以四十二票對一票通過十九委員所草擬之報告。與會各國乃。無一人公然贊助日本之主張。亦無一國是認日本之所謂［王道］亡道此次大會。至少爲世界各國明白認識日本之眞面。目同時宣告滿洲傀儡國。確爲日本軍閥所揑造。今後再不得以和平面具。欺騙世界。中國因反抗暴力之蹂躪而對日公然作戰。亦必因全世界道德上之援助。而氣勢爲之一振。</p>
<p>（二）盟約第十六條之運用</p>
<p>日本所以毁棄一切横行到底者。一則欺中國懦弱。勢難抵抗。再則利用英美對立。英蘇不和。必然實力足以制限日本。三則欺國聯僅爲一道德機關。祗憑口説。别無能耐。是故前年十月三十四日十三票對一票之决議。以日本單獨反對。匪特决議未能成立。Ｈ兵依舊盤據遼吉。且事態擴大至於吉黑錦義。近且又占據榆關。飛熱邊矣。</p>
<p>雖然。國聯以和平號召世界。而經濟恐慌。正未得出路。各國爲自身計。爲國際均衡計。皆不能用兵。而日本違約背信。事實昭然今且退出國聯。大舉進攻熱河。則國聯手無寸鐵。鳥足以制止日軍之狂進。何能期其議案之必行。縱令北美合衆國與蘇聯。皆欣然參與談判。恐猶未必能抑制日本之横暴。然非無術也。國聯盟約第十六條明明規定。</p>
<p>［聯合會員如不顧本約第十二條十三條十五條之規定。而從事戰爭］</p>
<p>者。則據此事實。應即視爲對於所有聯盟其他會員國有戰爭行爲。其他各會員國。担任立即與之斷絕各種［商業上］或［財政上］之關係。禁止其人民與破壞盟約國人民往來……。］</p>
<p>［遇此情形。國聯行政院應負責向關係各政府建議……各會員國各］</p>
<p>出海陸空之實力。組成軍隊。以維護國聯盟約之實行。］</p>
<p>此舉是否能見諸實施。固不待智者而後知之也。然實施之權與能不在遠處西歐之國聯本部。而在身受奇禍之中華民國。</p>
<p>（三）公理是否能戰勝强權</p>
<p>我國自瀋變發生以來。即祈求［公理］。現在公理旣已求得。而執行此［公理］之手段。似難責望於國聯。蓋日本退出國聯而後。即不受盟約拘束。更不管國聯裁决。祇憑其陸海軍實力。到處縱横。試看彼國陸軍徴調初年兵上戰塲。海軍則借大演習示威。其欲爆炸滿洲火藥庫。昭然若揭。其有挑動戰爭之意識。亦甚明顯。有人喻我爲歐洲戰初之比利時。其實非也。蓋我國旣得［公理］之扶助。而負有實施此公理之責。以自身利害關係而論。尤應奮其全力。以鐵拳驅逐盜賊。以赤血維護［公理。］</p>
<p>當東北事變之初。日本帝國主義者借口防止赤俄南下。以拉搆英吉利。以鼓惑法蘭西。彼乃坐收實利。席捲三省。着着爲戰爭之準備。至於壓抑换國民族革命運動。亦屬烟幕彈之一。迄今年餘列。國已悟日本之詭詐。察覺其借此</p>

<h3>大會之决議案</h3>
<p>（日内瓦）　今日下午五時、國聯大會續開後、中國代表顧維鈞發言、要求國聯援助中國渡過目前之困難、謂國聯應立即動議援用盟約所規定之制裁、並詳陳熱河危急情形、詢問國聯對此侵熱危機迫在眉睫之時、擬將如何處置、嗣又請國聯授權一特别委員會、以便會員國與非會員國之一致行動、防免遠東戰事之擴大、聲稱目下戰事正在遠東開始、倘各國不能結合、共同扶持國際之安全、則將有被牽入災禍　過之虞、顧氏曾欲駁斥日代表松岡在今晨大會中之演説、當爲主席希孟勸阻、請其發言、以關於主席所提出組織顧問委員會之决議案爲限、顧氏應允、但保留俟後提出書面駁斥松岡聲明之權、嗣國聯大會蔣决議案通過、即於六時二十一分休會、此次日代表未出席、僅有國聯二日籍秘書在會旁聽、至决議案内要點、（一）根據盟約第三欵第三節、國聯對於中日爭執之發展、不能熟視無覩、（二）命秘書長將報告書分送會員會與非會員國、告以國聯大會希望其取一致態度、（三）組織顧問委員會、觀察時局、贊助國聯大會執行盟約第三條第三項之責任、及贊助　以發展［大陸政策。］獨占中國市塲之陰謀。遠甚於其所謂防備［赤化］禦制蘇聯也。且自法蘇互不侵犯條約成立以來。歐洲形勢。大異往昔。東亞風雲。急於星火。此國際聯盟所以全體一致通過否認［滿洲國。］確定日本軍事行動。超出於自衛範圍也。</p>
<p>然而日本居顢頇。一意妄動。絕不能服之以公理。惟有用實力施以鐵血　　之敎訓。方可保持人類和平。全我國民生命安全。而今日世界眞能護持國聯　盟約握敎訓日本之鐵拳者。舍我中國。豈有他哉。</p>
<p>各國採取一致態度、（四）顧問委員會、以十九國委員會委員加入荷蘭加拿大爲委員、並邀美俄參加工作、（三）國聯大會存留不閉、主席得於必要時召集會議、（二十四日國民社電）</p>

<h3>日人進攻中之熱河概觀</h3>
<p>是天富國是處女地</p>
<p>决不容被日人攫去</p>
<p>但日人高呼舉開拓之斧</p>
<p>愈速愈妙以劈進熱河去</p>
<p>自山海關失陷後、熱河問題、便已成爲日本軍閥黷武立足點下之一帖［百尺竿頭］更上一步］的興奮劑、同時亦成爲我國當局［實力禦侮、長期抵抗］的試金石了、爲使國人明瞭熱河問題之眞相起見、茲略述熱河之概况如下、</p>
<h3>地域</h3>
<p>熱河包括東部内蒙古的昭鳥達盟·卓索圖盟·及清代圈作皇帝狩獵地的木蘭圍坊、省界南北自北緯四十度至四十六度、東西自東經百十六度至百二十二度、總面積約五十八萬方哩、北倚大興安嶺山脈、蜿蜒起伏、自東北而西南、西有陰山山脈、該山脈自賀蘭山繞河套北邊、横貫綏察二省至白岔山、分支東北迤者爲熱河與察哈爾之分界線、南迤者盤旋於熱河境内、爲七老圖山及努魯虎兒嶺、更有松嶺山脈、與渤海岸平行、爲熱河東南邊境的屏障、東北與遼寗省接壤、極目千里、成爲極大平原、北部邱陵起伏、東南部爲平原、中部與南部、則有河流與高山錯綜其間、河流有灤河·大凌河·小凌河等、</p>
<h3>人民</h3>
<p>熱河本係内蒙古的一部分、清乾隆年間、山東與直隸（今河北）等省、因人口擁擠、人民無以營生、遂相率移居於此、現在熱河各縣的居民、大都爲山東與直隸等省人民所移殖繁衍、衣食住及日常生活習慣·與關内居民、了無異趣、惟在西部及東北方面荒地上、至今尚有少數蒙古人居住、過着逐水蕌　的游牧生活、熱河人口約有四五百萬、幾完全爲漢人、蒙人與滿人、僅佔極少數、</p>
<h3>氣候</h3>
<p>熱河氣候、因爲境内山水綜錯、頗不一致、大致以距離海洋較遠、故帶有大陸性的特徴、就氣候上區分、每年可分爲四季、春季約有一個月、（自）五月上旬至六月上旬）夏季約有兩個月、（自六月中旬至八月上旬）秋季約有一個月、（自八月上旬至九月上旬）其餘的七八個月則都屬冬季、一年中最熱的爲七月、最高温度達攝氏六十度、最寒的爲一月、最低温度降至零下三十度、惟其氣候屬大陸性、所以雨量極少、通年下雨的日子、不過二十天左右、並且降雨的期間、亦極不平均、一年中雨量最多的爲六月至八月之間、但大都又是驟雨與小雨、少則數小時、多亦不過一二日、且因樹木極少、故河流極容易汜濫、每經降雨一次、交通輒遭阻滯、雪亦很少、每年大約僅四五次、若氣候激變、則五月間亦往往降雪、十月間河流即開始結冰、至翌年四月上旬、纔能融解、但亦因南北氣候之不同、結冰解冰的時期、亦稍有異、北部通年多風、尤以春季與冬季爲甚、風力頗大、五月至九月間、大都是南風·或東南·西南風、十月以降、則風勢凛冽、剌人膚骨、爲西北風、</p>
<h3>物産</h3>
<p>熱河天賦優厚、物質資源、</p>
<p>極爲富饒、以是爲日人埀涎、茲述其物産大概如次、</p>
<p>米約四五·○○○石</p>
<p>小麥　約四○○·○○○石</p>
<p>高梁　約一·五○○·○○○石</p>
<p>羊毛　約二·○○○·○○○石</p>
<p>礦産則新邱·大寗溝·岳家溝·西元寳山·十大分·五家·松樹台等處、均産煤、此外羊毛·甘草·及其他各種藥材、亦爲熱河之特産、每年産額、亦頗可觀、</p>
<p>綜上而觀、可知熱河實爲一天富之國、爲一處女地、無論就政治的或經濟的見地而言、熱河决不容爲日人所攫去、目前日人一致瘋狂地高呼着［趕快舉起開拓之］斧、愈速愈妙、劈進熱河去］、對熱侵略、亦已總動員、那末、我們該怎樣呢、望國人都想想罷、</p>

<h3>陳翰譽被殺與拒李有關李濟深致函各將領關謡</h3>
<p>廣州通信、粤省軍事當局、近忽將前任第四集團軍參謀長之陳翰譽槍决、傳者謂與拒李濟深回粤有關係、綠本月十二日、陳寓居東山、忽爲軍警逮捕而去、十三日、送交第一集團軍總司令部軍法處審訊、十三日下午、即派隊將陳押赴紅花崗槍决、總部并在刑塲附近貼有布告、略謂退伍軍人陳翰譽出没廣州、圖謀不軌、經審訊明確、判處死刑等語、查陳初爲第五軍團長、民國十三年、曾任大本營要職、爲孫中山所賞識、民國二十年、廣州新成立國民政府、組織參謀團、其時李濟深之親信馮祝萬任參謀團主任、馮即以陳翰譽充參謀團副主任、是陳似爲接近李濟深者、顧粤當局對於李濟深感情甚劣、李第一次南下抵港、即爲粤當局擋駕、未幾、李之親信馮祝萬因此而去財廳長之　李最近二次南下、在港、疴、粤當局又有防範、詎不知如何、外間忽有李將任西南國防會主席之謡、粤當局旣正式否認、而防李活動亦益嚴、陳翰譽適於此時被逮處死、故外間疑與防李有關也、陳死後、政府方面反李宣傳愈烈、謂李昔日在粤、卸任時交代不清、最近又函陳伯南（濟棠）請撥活動費云云、李因此即在港致一長函與粤中將領、略謂［弟自任四軍以迄八路、一替一代、接任四軍者爲伯南兄、接任八路者又適爲伯南兄、皆兄輩所能記憶者、然二次皆由馬炳洪移交、陳應麟接收、當日固交收清楚、不然、馬陳二兄今尚在廣州、何難覆按、東北淪喪、將及二紀、稍有天良、無不憤激、故一時徇某某之請、函介張菊池代爲呼籲、請月撥費用、成其壯舉、伯南兄則謂廣東財政公開、不能作主、須提請政務會通過、雖後經否决、即某某諸君未拜嘉惠、然未嘗不欽佩伯南公開態度、何竟以此謂爲弟請伯南撥活動費耶、尚冀明白糾正、俾釋羣欵云云、觀此、可知粤方對李尚多隔膜、又李在港、雖經黄紹竑之勸、仍未允北上、惟聲言日間將返桂一行耳、（十四日）</p>
<h3>藏僧之藏事談</h3>
<h3>較能海法師所談尤詳亦謂達頼對英已變態</h3>
<p>重慶航信、頃據新由西藏返川來重慶之僧人曼陀釋菓玲漫、譚西藏最近情形、較前由藏返川之能海法師、尤爲詳細、特記於後、以告留心西藏情形之國人、</p>
<h3>正治</h3>
<p>西藏在近數年來、所有軍民各政、均操諸達頼一人、初達頼感覺已身勢力薄弱、遂極端親英、以英帝國主義作背境、穩固其自身之地位、近來所系勢力雄厚、全藏入彼一人之手、於是對英人已不如前之獻媚、遇英方對藏有不利之舉動、均極端反對、所以現在的達賴、實不如昔日親英之達賴、</p>
<h3>經濟</h3>
<p>全藏經濟、因近來屢受戰爭影響、政府和人民、益形枯竭、川康藏戰事發生、所耗民財、竟達三百萬盧比、去年五月藏軍敗北、達賴又向英國購價值五十餘萬元之軍械、商民因微税過重、均有坐以待斃之勢、即以拉薩（藏京）一市而言、因受經濟影響而倒閉商店、一月内達五十餘家、西藏出外購物、必須在印度換盧比、從前藏銀四元、可換一盧比、現在藏銀三十元、始換一盧比、達賴爲收羅現銀起見、鑄造銅幣、發行紙幣、迫民使用、現在西藏民間的資産、祇銅和紙而已、</p>
<h3>軍事</h3>
<p>西藏軍隊、現祇有步兵·騎兵·砲兵、步大都由民間抽來、很少訓練、其中有五千餘人、曾受英俄日人的訓練、算是最精鋭的、現駐隆布嶺·卡花園、軍械從印度買來、是印度棄而不用的、最近始由英國購來一批新式步槍·機關槍·過山砲、藏軍所穿制服、都由英國承辦、其式樣及顏色、完全與英兵相同、軍隊所用的旗幟、上面係一隻獅子、其顏色紅黄藍白黑都有、現在所有的軍隊約十萬人左右、兵士年齡、由十六歲至六十歲、官長每年得九百兩蠻銀外、並由達賴賜給田地、如因打仗而死的、田地由子孫承繼、士兵每月除得餉銀四兩外、亦由達賴賜給田地若干、</p>
<h3>社會</h3>
<p>西藏因天冷關係、物産甚少、人民生活、低下不堪、主要食品、不外大麥·小麥·青科等、上流社會、間或食米、大都由印度方面購入、即日用之油鹽、亦均從印度運進、</p>
<h3>民衆</h3>
<p>西藏民衆、可分爲三部份、一部份是擁戴班禪的、一部份是擁護達賴的、還有一份是紅黄兩敎、擁戴班禪的民衆、雖常常盻望班禪回藏、脱離達賴的苛政、可是班禪以勢力不敵、回藏頗爲困難、（二月二十三日）</p>

<h3>讀者顧顧問</h3>
<p>做工私戀愛</p>
<p>丨本埠韋影君來信丨</p>
<p>編者先生：我現在是一個國貨工廠的工人學徒。爲家境清貧，童年讀書，間多輟學，但幸終能小學畢業。於卒業後在内地商店學業，生活當然不足與我以滿意。去年冬，我因種種之環境，而來滬謀業，在意非所思中，就做了一個工人的學徒。工時勞力，工餘勞腦，文武兼之，迄今三月，嘗有人譏我以做連工人還不如之工人奴𨽻，猶自處之安閒，是幾多無聊無謂？�</p>
<p>我認爲這頽與我無關之譏駡，無意識之譏駡，可絕無加以回覆。在家鄉，家庭，朋友，親戚，誰也想不到我會做工來，並且尚多有加我以贊詞的，説：［像你的勤讀，老天不負苦心人，現在你到上海，是幸福了！享福了！］每看到這樣言語、我恨書讀少，不能運用極酸痛的字句，來表白我的生活，以及用心、對於我本人，自誇曾未依賴家庭，親戚，謀生活，而能以堅苦自立，中心原自寛慰：但每忖做工終非長計，非特我家庭聞之傷痛，在我之另一朋友知之，我倆必將傷失終身幸福。每念及此，心殊良痛，此所稱爲另一之朋友，卽我之終身伴侶。男子每於相當年齡，均皆欲愛；我亦當不例外，試述之告先生！在内地商店學業時，店東之女，由日常由我之行動，才能，給伊以考慮；進店後年半，她就與我以愛。我當時很驚喜有這艶遇，因對於她之一切才貌，顧問、均足使我喜悦。半年友誼之愛經過，於去冬，每夜她來告訴我，説她曾與母親商量我倆婚姻問題，却喜老人家並不反對，惟以父親之舊息想，［養女望高門，］倘你或能戰位上找一較好之工作之則此婚姻不難成就，可以握定。她對我是這麽説。本來，我於商店之生活不慣，商人種種舉動，良使我以不滿，在聆她言語後，我隨就告以［我决改變工作。］我説改變工作是極有把握，因預早由朋友推薦，在滬上已找到練習生位置。［人生不如意，十常八九，］爲患病故而僅遲到五日抵滬，至則該練習生位置，已爲該廠股東所薦之人充任；於焉，我毅然改充工人。我對她極端抱歉。她每次來信，都萬分表示情感熱烈，且述父親已充，惟須待升至職員後始可正式訂婚，最遲期限兩年。此信寄來已一禮拜，在本禮拜内來催我回復信凡二次，我躊躇久之，擯棄，除非我終身不娶；否則，再難找到此種合格女子。天下好女子儘多，但怎肯下嫁無才，無財之窮男子？何况她並未負我，而更從未有因清貞而輕賤我，有時尚以經濟帮助我購買書籍；這飄種，擯棄何忍？許她條件，她父親爲人，平日我深知，言行從無絲毫更改，限我須於兩年升至職員，以我才學，僅讀書六年，中國社會之人浮於事，我想達到兩年内升爲職員，除或夢境！且我根本極希研究工業工之　有意味，三月來事實爲我證明。雖然泥灰臉油漬衣，然我並不以此而灰心，反常常自言：［中國人生之典型，果能如是，至少之希望，可以與列强並駕齊驅。］卽就於我個人人生，做職員，練習生，除錢多之外，有何興趣？總此我感到做學徒，除給　又打駡之外，皮肉受損失之外，精神是極端快樂！有時我很想老實告訴我父親，以及她知道，但終無勇氣；今又因她之來信，而使我觸感一切，老年人思想是：工爲卜賤，工爲無知無識！編者先生：當處於道種種復健環境之下，我何以處之？個人方寸腦力，應用殊覺嫌短，請先生有以賜敎，對於她，果如何回復？對於家庭，果如何以應處？復信明日發表　　孫愼方君高誼可風</p>
<p>自本欄披露鎭海吳君［無路可走］一信後，（見本月廿一日本欄）旋接本埠孫愼方君來信，願以個人力量，資助吳君繼續讀書，其熱心盛意，殊足令人敬佩，本欄除轉函吳君囑逕與孫君接洽外，以孫君如此熱忱，不可多得，未容湮没，特在本欄爲之表揚，並代吳君向孫君伸謝。</p>

<p>（丁）在每星期間願辭在每星期紀念週時、全體宣讀、或將辭意編成歌曲吟唱又每星期也可擇定一個適當的德目、特加注重、作爲公共的訓練、但切不所流於呌口號貼標語的形式、</p>
<p>（戊）在每週六十分鐘特定時間把六十分鐘分作三次、間日敎學、或分作六次逐日指導、在每次特定時間、由我員將偶發事項引用條目、加以申説、如舉行訓練週、就應注重和中心德目有關係的條目、</p>
<p>（二）個别的訓練可酌量全校師生的多寡、分成若干組或若干團、每一敎員負一組或一團的個别訓練責任、對本團的兒童、用種種方法督導他實踐條目、自行檢察、並注意考查成績、</p>
<p>二·各校應設一公民訓練委員會、共同議定公民訓練的組織系統和公民訓練的具體方法、全體敎員都須參加、</p>
<p>三·各校在每學期開始時、應將訓練條目、分别階段·成小册或活頁、由各組或各團分發兒童、使兒童明瞭本學期内應該注意的事項、並得反省的機會、</p>

<p>五·兒童每學生做得到的訓練條目、以後仍須繼續訓練相考查、</p>
<p>六·訓練條目、各地方主管敎育行政機關得輔導各校根據事實的需要、酌量壇减或更改階段、七·各校敎員、應利用機會、根據本標準用暗示的方法、和兒童共同擬定條目、並討論實現各種條目的方法、以避免强制的方式、</p>
<p>八·公民訓練考查法、除各敎師平時視察記載外、各組或各團、應每星期或每月定期舉行考查、把訓練條目使兒童自已反省或共同批評、並利用比賽及名譽奬勵等、以增進訓練的效率、九·考者公民訓練的成績、應編制兒童反省記載表、敎部觀察記載表、一組或一團比較表和報告家長用　等、使師生及家長對於公民訓練的成績可以一目了然、</p>

<h3>特載對於浙省敎育的幾種願望</h3>
<p>我對於浙省的敎育界以及於敎育有關的各方、有幾種意見和願望、在此二十二年開始的時候、簡單的陳述一上、</p>
<p>一·我希望本省服務敎育者、時時刻苦、實事節約、天天振作、人人興奮、來實踐敎育救國的忐愿、要知道幾小時的無認游閒、一張紙一枝筆的浪費、在國難嚴重中、都是不可計算的損失、二·我希望敎育者認　我國的國勢、要切實認識我們的責任不僅在造成一個一個的人、而在造成我們國家生存上所需要的國民、凡　於中華民國敎育宗旨及其實施方針、只取形式的默認而不能眞實地履行者、此其人只算作偶爾服務於敎育、而不是國家所需要的敎育者、</p>
<p>三·我希望本省的中小學校敎職員、切實注意於學生的課業、不要表面上應有盡有、装飾得五色繽紛、而使許多家長在考查子弟學業時、縐眉蹙額、有［今不如昔］的嘆聲、現在一般學生（縱然不是全體）程度的低淺、無論其原因如何、總之是欲諱舞、的　實、因此我切望大家莫談高遠莫炫新奇、目眞憑實據的提出　於學生課業交代得過的事實來、</p>
<p>四·我希望本省的主持民衆敎育者、不要徒然憤慨於社會對民敎的淡漠、經費的艱窘和進展的困難、我以爲各縣辦理民衆敎育不要當作奉行功令看、不要當作装點門面看、我們各縣的民衆敎育館要集中注意於一種或幾種的活動、埋頭苦幹起來、引起大家　重視、在敎育落後的地方切不可自暴自棄、成爲只掛一塊招牌的一個無用機關、在經濟人才較有辦法的地方、也不可貪多務博、反致拿不出一件眞實的成績出來、更其不可以手段爲目的、祇做到民衆娛樂的所在、而絕無敎育的意義、</p>
<p>五·我希望各縣縣長對於敎育的熱心和關切、要更進一步、一縣的發達和繁榮、各種縣政的進行、都和敎育消長有密切的關係、所以全縣敎育大計的主持、興敎勸學的提倡、都是賢明的縣長所應引爲已任的、</p>
<p>六·我希望各縣敎育局長要勤奮惕厲、在萬苦千</p>
<h3>陳布雷</h3>
<p>辛中謀地方敎育的鞏固和發展、第一自已的行止要嚴格檢點、第二對人的態度不可太輕率、辦事的手續不可太疏忽、第三要忍得住委屈、經得起緊　、任勞任怨、有條有理、</p>
<p>Ｌ·我希望我們浙江學生的家長、再不可不注意到子女的品性和課業、再不可不預先策劃子女的前途、許多年青的學生們、有家長隨時督促敎導的、總比没有家長管敎的成績要好得多、至對於子女的升學問題、尤其是一個極應嚴重考慮而多數家長都忽略了的問題、許多青年的不得其所、我以爲這是一個大原因、我認爲各個家長當自已的子女在小學異業時、無考慮無計劃無準備地把子女往普通初中一送、不一定是愛子女的方法、在初中畢業時、因爲本來没有整個的計劃、同樣的怱忙而無考慮無準備地姑且普通高中一送、以爲讓他們過了四年再説這尤其有貽害子女的可能、因爲如果家庭不能負擔入學學費時、那其結果必然是悲慘的、非子女與家庭不協、卽是子女因順從家庭强輟學而覓不到相當的職業、唯其我們浙江升學的人數並不算少、我個人感覺到這一個意義更爲深切、我以爲各個家長對子女升學就業都應該仔細考量、預爲規劃、如里家庭的供給和子女個性適於在某階段爲止時、毅然的替他决定輟學、或改入各種職美陶冶的機關爲就業的準備、却是家長最疾愛子女的辦法、</p>
<p>八·我希望我們浙江的父老兄弟、恢復二十餘年前初辦學校時候的精神、來推進我們全省各縣的敎育我們在省費如此艱絀之狀况下、各縣的農村經濟又顯露着崩潰的現象、而我們所應該做的、如興辦各級職業學校、如推行義務敎育、如添設民衆學校……等等、都是刻不容緩而需要有不少的經費的、我們現在没有别的可以勝過困難祗有鼓起一顆顆的熱心、把敎育上的問題解决、若不是各縣各區各鄉鎭的人士、共起明謀、全省的父老兄弟、竭力襄助、則兩浙敎育文化、必至無可進展、爲謀本省同胞的幸福計、不能不懇切祈求於至浙人士的協力了、</p>

<h3>東華六比零大勝蘭開夏</h3>
<p>造成甲組十六次凈勝之紀錄</p>
<p>尚餘二次比賽錦標不成問題</p>
<p>西聯甲組賽中、東華擁健强之實力、挾百勝之威名、昨日大兵臨逸園、又以六對零一致而擒蘭開夏、造成十六次净勝之紀錄、按照秩序尚餘四捕與英軍各一次比賽甲組錦標、早在握中、今後努力之點、卽在保住百戰百勝之偉績耳、</p>
<h3>東華隊勝來甚易</h3>
<p>東華隊昨日全隊表演、尚非書善盡美、但較之蘭開夏、實有天壤之别、乃出以游戲輕敵之舉動、否則或有更佳之紀錄、周賢言穩健如故、堪稱海上第一人、李寗腿傷未愈、遜色良多、關洵安大有進境、前程無限、中衛綫馮運佑吳幼良屠開元、三人如一體、攻守咸佳、陳虚添邇來甚有可觀、萬象華昨日精彩不多、陳家球平平、李義臣賣力、曹秋亭一身是膽、雖難盡如人意、亦覺無愧厥職、一脚成功、頓開本屆個人得分紀錄、宜乎滿面春風也、</p>
<h3>蘭開夏力戰失敗</h3>
<p>蘭開夏並非第一流球隊、戰鬭實力、確係平常、適逢鶇　華處之以安逸態度、乃能起與相抗、中衛綫奮鬭甚力、前鋒亦逢隙卽入、惟前者少接濟工夫面後者乏射擊脚頭、雖時有猛烈之進迫、終無若何效果者此也、内衛處位不當、技藝又疏、守鬥空有其表、毫無實際、每逢緊險、手忙足亂、東華若加之以全力、所失必不至此數、</p>
<h3>四球源源入門來</h3>
<p>開戰未十分鐘、屠開元踢任意球、趨向球門、守者接得、抬頭見對方進撲、回身急向後方踢去、驚慌失惜、令人爲之一笑、繼之左右兩角、俄而、吳幼良又挾球進攻、李義臣隨影疾入、與守者互撲倒地、球還至陳家球身旁、陳氏從容一脚、然人門、李臥地不及起、進球以其越位作罷論、又五五鐘、右内衛史温手胃觸球、罰十二碼、李義臣右脚起處、應聲入門、紀錄一開、源源而來、李氏忽然出以生龍活虎之姿態、單身匹馬、闖入敵關、又五分鐘、曹秋亭一預、陳虞添盤旋進展、乘敵不備、猛力射出、正中右角、三球旣獲、曹氏亦雄心勃發、孤軍暗陣、有志竟成、奪旗而歸、上半四時零對佔先、</p>
<h3>敵壘累破凱旋返</h3>
<p>下半時起、敵假風力、進迫甚厲、在二十分鐘内、敵勢較高、東華三次反攻、均失利而退、其時敵方攻勢雖盛、終環於内衛綫之外、不能登門入室、久而久之、馮運佑奮臂而起、奪球出國、轉交前方、李義臣一聲得令、帶頂帶盤、瞬息之間、打入門内、屠開元在門前雙飛踢球、被罰任意球、雙方在門前列陣對峙、形勢緊張中寓有滑稽趣味、一球離脚、雙方爭奪、最後仍由屠氏救出、將功贖罪、未幾、萬象華左陲興兵、單槍入陣、立功而返、結果不華六對零全勝、裁判派克、</p>

<h3>戰前民衆應有之準備</h3>
<p>— 沛公</p>
<p>丨大刀與防奮面具丨</p>
<p>幾個月前英吉利有一位學者在孟却斯德導報上發表了一篇極精警的　言論，題日：［準備最惡劣的環境之來到］；人意是説第二次世界大戰不久，爆發，世人應有相當之覺悟與準備，英國人尚且有這樣的思想，我們首當其衝的中國人，對於目前立刻就可以發生的禍變，大家究竟打算怎樣應付，怎樣準備呢？</p>
<p>談到準備，照我的毛包脾氣説，大家惟有準備拚命，的確，拚命眞是一個最積極的準備，但是，人家不肯拚命，也不　强迫政府暫守不敎你拚命，也無從反抗，那末，姑且不得已而求其次，我們先做一番保全自已生命的準備吧！</p>
<p>朋以，請你相信我，在戰爭漸趨劇烈之後，以殺人爲國民敎育的日本人，難免要用一番［毒瓦斯］的。所以，我們應該請求科學家，醫生和藥房趕快聯合起來製造多景的防毒面具，讓大家購買。其次，説得不利市一些，也許戰事初期，沿海各地，會有給敵軍蹂躝的可能，民衆説不定就有直接和敵人拚命的機會，那末備一柄大刀，努力的磨礪着，也是至少限度的準備！</p>
<p>朋友，大家認清楚，這一次的戰爭，乃是我們中國人生死關頭，與其退而死，無寗進而死！怕什麽！敵人要我們死，我們也得敎他們死！</p>
<h3>東洋鏡</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>丨拆穿了丨</p>
<p>一件事的門檻，已經晴瞭；一件事　的黑幕，已經揭開；這呌做［拆穿西洋鏡］。大概中國人腦經簡單，目光遲鈍，瞧見了外國人的把戲，奇異得不可思議，如顯微鏡望遠鏡之類，都駭爲神神鬼斧的器物了。還有一班江湖上的朋友，在街上村頭，擺了一隻箱子，用凸鏡來放大裏面的畫片，吸引得街頭的兒童，聚着觀看，風景啦，戲劇啦，戰爭啦，花花綠綠，形形色色，弄得觀衆看了出神。最後，還有神秘的活動春畫，瞥然的映了一刹那，這尤其是使得觀衆神魂飄蕩的；所以這種西洋鏡到如今還是各地都有，成了江湖朋友的一種職業。其實，風景是攝影的；戲劇是紙畫的；至於漢宮春色，凡是人們，各具了拿手的好戲；所以拆穿説，這種西洋鏡一些兒没有觀看的價值。</p>
<p>天下的事，都應該作如是觀：譬如女人，儀態萬方，誰敢動了輕薄的念頭。可是摩登的小姐，也許在舞塲裏擁慣了男子；公館裏的姨太太，櫃檯裏的花瓶，也許便是人肉市塲裏的中堅人物；所以拆穿了西洋鏡，身價一些兒没有華貴。政界學界商界中的偉人，也是一樣的；遠遠地瞧過去，眞令人不敢作劉楨的平視，威風凛凛，架子十足，誰不見了膽落。其實，拆穿了西洋鏡，不但變做了紙糊老虎，也許比狗馬不及，眞亦令人笑落了牙齒。</p>
<p>東洋倭國，原是世界上五大强國之一；併朝鮮，吞台灣，割琉球，敗强俄，他們玩些東洋鏡，眞是熱鬧，一張一張的玩過去，從没有玩過一回悲劇。自從九一八以來，不遺一矢的攫了藩陽，後來完全吞了滿洲，恐怕世界上的觀衆，發生了反感，便在東洋鏡裏玩了一張傀儡戲。現在東洋鏡完全拆穿，世界上的觀衆，都起來喝倒采，可是它老着面皮，依然趕了下去。們中國人自從淞滬一役以後，領過了回敎一，他們玩的東洋鏡，也早已拆穿；換了幾個同令，終不能打敗我們的十九路軍。而且在俘虜身上，搜出［太上老君］，急急如律令，敕！］的護身符，以及非戰怕死的日記，這不是拆穿東洋鏡麽？我們中國人，素來只知道拆穿西洋鏡，現在大家快起來［拆穿東洋鏡］吧！</p>

<h3>街頭藝術者</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>丨揑粉人丨</p>
<p>在低矮的屋檐下，安排着小五車壁　畫的狹弄裏，或工廠區域的冷静地方：我們會發現了街頭藝術者。</p>
<p>你不要以爲宮廷裏的月冠詩人，音樂家，畫師，建築師，以及御用的一切大才，纔得名之爲藝術家。到這時代，老的死去，新的産生，華爾加的勞工的呼吸，便是音樂，鐵匠的對話，便是詩，能作意象畫，夠稱是畫師了，當然，建築家的尊稱，不當由打樣者獨人掠美，而是每一個參加　屋工作的木匠泥水匠都是建築師。因爲藝術家果然應該用腦，但同時必需用力。</p>
<p>並且，你更須知道，所謂藝術品，不單是詩，歌，畫，劇，建築等等，用現代很光來找尋藝術品，應該具這種見解　讓我替你介紹街頭藝術者：</p>
<p>可不是嗎？一個穿着藍布村服的江北老頭兒，鬚和髮都很長，説起來有一點像托爾斯泰：他也不會刷牙齒，衣襟上滿沾着涕痕和齷齪，倒又像是［不脩邊］幅］的王安石或現代國學大師章太炎；他决不是個貪懶的人，他一生使忠誠於自信的技能的修養，從早晨起，離開貧窮的家，掮着擔，走上藝術的征途。在小孩子多處，他便放下這擔子。</p>
<p>一藝術家對於小孩子們純潔的天眞，特别會歌詠贊美，每個人的生活，也惟有在摇籃裏聽母親低唱着眠歌最舒適最恬静的了。而街頭藝術者亦復如此。　　他坐在小孩子面前，便微笑了。打開擔子，拿出粉或糖，用他的手，會提出綠色的鸚鵡，紅臉的關壯繆，以及首纒紅布的印度人的塑象。如果要他手制不倒翁相刀馬武旦之類，也都奕奕如生。這些技能的作品，雖然也有高下，然正與文學著作助音樂曲譜同樣從每一個作家創造出來的有着决難一致的成績。我們總不能因爲由因襲時觀念説這些粉或糖製的模型，不成爲藝術品，正如希臘意大利的雕刻和歐洲著名的剪形（Ｓba）</p>
<p>dow　Figure）不能不承認他是藝術品一樣，同樣理由，而且要表現出現代激進社會生活之活躍的象徴的藝術，不是古典主義的美，而是粗燥的力的美了。對着近代德國野獸派的畫，惡鷹主義的文藝運動，使我更相信我的理論。</p>
<p>這些街頭藝術者把他的作品廉價出售給小孩子們，其待遇在中國，也正如文人賣稿一樣的過着棲慘的生涯。</p>

<h3>田莊主</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>［好］！田莊主像一頭猛虎似的跳將起來，眸子睜得比銅鈴還大　。一老大，老二，……你們帶三十個人先去抵擋一陣！…………］他把刀尖指揮着被點到的人，便馬上提起脚步走了。後面六條純黄色的猛犬，發出虎吼似的咆哮來，尾巴像鐵桿一般的　着，爭先恐後的隨着他們的主人，奮勇赴敵。</p>
<p>人和犬的馳驟的脚步聲，立即激起一重緊張的空氣。</p>
<p>［老五，小鈴，小禾，趕快去準備弓箭！］田莊主又調出了第二批的兵將；這是準備萬，前線支持不下，退回來堅守莊子用的。　　田莊主有兩匹好馬，乃是他在中年時候，親自打北方帶回來的；以前兩次的［斬倭之役］，牠們也曾立下偉大的血汗功勛。這時已有兩個長工把它們牽到了廣塲上來，馬也很懶得主人的意思，知道它們快臨陣了，便一齊揚鬣長嘶起來。</p>
<p>因爲已受過了兩番的訓練，田莊主家裏的長工，每一個人都有一顆斗大的膽。第二批的援兵，便無須田莊主調撥，已簇擁着老三殺出去了。</p>
<p>老三是田莊主七個兒子中最勇猛的一個。他曾經用一匹馬，枝槍，殺退過三百個倭子；還有一次，他前額上中了倭子的箭，鮮血把他的一張淡黄臉染成了深紅色，他還是力戰不退，最後，他用力拔下了那一枝箭來，反射過去，竟利用它射死了一個倭子的隊長。</p>
<p>［莊主！倭子勢大，他們抵擋不了，三十個人已死了一半了！］</p>
<p>田莊主才跨上了馬，準備親出迎戰的時候，第二次的警報又來了　　［倭子已到了那裏？］老人很從容地除下了身上的大褂，又把一支短劍斜挿在背上。</p>

<h3>坐的姿態和心理揣測</h3>
<p>— 婉貞</p>
<p>我和張小組對坐着，我對伊道：我不知道你爲什麽是心不在焉的］</p>
<p>［我很担心呢，但是：］伊説着便對我看了一眼，接着問道。</p>
<p>［你説的有什麽意思呢？］</p>
<p>我告伊道：［我本在注意你坐着的姿態呢。］我知道伊一定要問得明白白的，我便接着簡略信和伊説了：</p>
<p>一我可以猜出你的思潮，從你坐着兩條腿安置的姿勢中推集出來，譬如！你坐着兩條腿分開，脚趾却向裏變着，如第一圖這種姿勢，是表示你無聊得很，要不是你在那裏胡思亂想，就一定是你心不在焉了。</p>
<p>像這種坐法，兩條腿决不是很整齊的排列着，並不是隨意一坐都會有這種姿勢的。祇要留心等那人如此坐的時候，你便追問伊，讓伊説出來是不是如此情形的。（伊聽了就許會跳起）來的）。</p>
<p>有許多人坐着，兩腿並得很着齊。如第二圖這種姿態，似乎太踏重了些，在那時候那人的腦筋，一定是很清楚的，思想也是敏捷的；伊那時，一定很通地規矩，而且似乎是正襟危坐含着一股凛然不可犯的神氣。</p>
<p>有許多人坐着，兩腿一前一後，放着的，如第三圖這種姿態，似乎有所深思，或者是含着詩人幽閒的態度。</p>
<p>有人背靠了椅子，半躺半坐，腿壓着腿，如第四圖這人的姿態，似乎太隨便了。</p>
<p>自然不能説人人准是如此的，這不過是就多數人姿態上加以揣測罷了。</p>

<h3>所謂［解釋］</h3>
<p>— 李水</p>
<p>我不怕大人物隨意殺人，我只怕大人物在殺了人以後再來一個［解釋］！老虎吃羊，吃了就完了；偏是人吃了人以後，還要把自已説得仁至義盡，抱被吃的人説得十惡不赦，永刦不復，這才可怕。</p>
<p>入類，不盡是中國人，都有點崇拜大人物的心理，弱小的説了十聲百聲，不能引人注意；大人物只要放一個屁，就會聳動聽聞。譬如古時，皇帝若做錯了一件事，錯殺了一個人，如时皇帝自已不以爲錯，自然大家都無話可説：如果他説自已做錯了，表示懊悔，則那些大臣學士們便立刻會歌段主上聖明，捧個透屁，對於做錯了的事和殺錯了的人自然是錯也應當，不在話下了，然而這還是只有天子做得到，若在其次的大人物，便必須［解釋］了！</p>
<p>［解釋］的方法不一：做好了手脚，埋下了證贓，直接宣佈何以殺人的［眞相］（？）以求得天下人的諒解一也，指鹿爲馬，顚倒黑白，使世人目迷五色，是非莫辨，二也；若遇形勢險惡，譬如在德謨克拉西氣味很濃重的現代，大人物的行動時常要爲不識事務的年青小子所指摘的現代，大人物爲躱避那些惡毒的視綫起見，可以向比自已更大的大人物［解釋］，再由［大大人物］出來向民衆［解釋］一下，三也。</p>
<p>日人侵占東北，已夠使我們痛心了；但當我們聽了日人在國際聯盟會的那種［替支那人開發東北富源］［替支那人趕走軍閥！消弭内戰］的仁至義盡的［解釋］以後，不呌我們更覺痛心嗎？</p>
<p>ＸＸＸＸＸ在槍殺了一個ＸＸＸＸ以後，受到筆桿兒的聲討，據報載於Ｘ月Ｘ日已向ＸＸ大大人物［解釋］過了，我實在擔心那位大大人物又不知怎樣來替那主席先生在民衆向前［解釋］，想來是：［官兒聖明，奴才咎由自取］吧！</p>
<p>唉，死者已矣，生者呢？［好頭頸，誰當斵之？］望大家摸摸自已的脖子罷！</p>
<h3>黄昏隨筆</h3>
<p>— 錢歌川</p>
<p>我們爲人家忙了一天，在日夜交接的時候，懶洋洋地跑回家裏想睡覺而不睡，却拈起一枝香烟來。香烟是興奮的，誰都知道。在黄昏中憑欄吹一兩口青烟，不是詩人的我，也感着這閒時的可愛。舉首是茫茫的天色，低頭是憧憧的人影。一切幻想都從這半明之中建設起來。我便想利用這個萬有的時候，盡量地思索一回，日間所得不到的東西，統統想到。然而我還没有看到那最幸福的生活的時候，早被理智的明燈照破了。我的目前，没有幸福，只有一個個的人頭，稀疏地走過。我的耳中，彷彿有一個聲音在響：［不要妄想吧！］妄想是自已吃苦的！］這時我完全清醒了。目光到處，是一個没有戴帽的男人的西式頭。他的頭髮，像一塊新裁的黑緞，光滑可以鑒人，我忽然覺悟到，人家都戴着帽，而他獨不戴，一定是不想掩没了他那頭髮的美。中國女人都不戴帽，大約也是這個原因吧。西式頭都是從左邊分的，據説是從拿破侖起。拿破侖因爲右腦壳上有疤痕，所以把頭髮從左邊梳過來蓋住它，世人不知其内幕，都説這樣梳了好看，於是便成了美的標準。</p>
<p>走下樓，到街上逛逛，一出門便看見一些野雞正向過路的男子表示情愛。這是上海晚晚有的活劇，我不要看，仍朝前面走去。後面叱喝地來了一部黄包車，上面坐着一個穿得極闊的女人。它走到我前面，不到三丈遠，驀然哎呀一聲，車夫踏着一塊香蕉皮跌倒在地，闊婦人也由車上翻了下來，綢旗袍被扯破了。女人伏在地上，指着車夫駡了幾句之後，忽然放聲地哭起來。路人都圍攏來了，我也凑上前去看熱鬧。只聽見那女人邊哭邊訴，起初是要車夫給她賠衣後來知道車夫賠不起，便只好怨天：［天呀！你爲什麽一定要把我這一件出外的衣裳扯破呀。敎我明天到工塲裏去穿什麽呢？我做了三年工。纔做了這一件衣裳，我現在一個錢也没有呀！］路上那些服装華麗的人，聽了都同聲嘆息。只有一個穿着布衣的中年婦人，却一聲不響，豪爽地在衣袋裏掏出一張五元的鈔票來遞給她，説：［拿這個去做件布衣］穿穿吧。］</p>
<p>觀衆散了，我仍舊朝前走去。遠遠地看見一家店面，電燈輝煌，走近一看，始知是Ｗ·Ｃ書局正因營業發達，新搬了大店面，在賣着特價呢。店面由大而小，書價由貴而賤，眼前所昭示我們的事實，無論如何是賺了錢。但我心中總有點覺得奇怪，暗想：昨夜徐君所説的話，難道是假的嗎？他明明説Ｗ·Ｃ·書局虧空了好多萬，現在快關門了。爲賺錢反而要賣大廉價，這也許是薄利多賣的商業上的手段；可是　快關門反而要搬大店面，這個我却無論怎麽也不能了解！</p>

<p>是一個晴和的初春傍晚，夕陽臺無氣力地斜映在狄思威路左側的行人道上。我從女青年會出來，拖着瘦長的影子向北四川路的電車停留塲走去。　　我是預備搭電車到海格路肺病療養院去探望一位友的人。等了好久我才跳上一部乘客意外擁擠的一路電車。車中除了我同一位廣東氣味很濃厚的身材短小而且很胖的太太以外，全是男人。　　因爲在三等車中，而且人又這樣的擠，坐位自然是没有希望了，所以就站在車廂外的月臺上，不想進去。車到了靶子路，有幾個人要下去，買票員要我往裏擠，也就往裏擠了。秩序起了絕大的混亂，那些站着的男人，都毫不吝惜的橋過頭來儘是瞪着你看。雖然下去了不少人，但是上來的似乎也不很少。你的身體依然受着嚴重的壓迫。那位胖太太不知擠到那裏去了。</p>
<p>［給你坐罷！］忽然一隻手落在我的臂膀上。是一個靠着價目牌坐的穿西装的少年男子。</p>
<p>［謝謝你！］我毫不遲疑地坐下了。他便在我的跟前站着。膝蓋對着膝藎，時常爲了車身的顚簸，怪癢地在磨擦着，很使人不舒服，可是有什麽法子呢？是他讓給我坐的。漸漸這非常的接觸，成爲經常性了，跟着索性釘住你不動了，隨後竟把你的雙膝夾在堅硬的兩腿之間，使你一動都不能動。</p>
<p>［眞擠死人了！］抽了一抽我的腿，忿忿地説。</p>
<p>［對了，眞討厭，這麽多的人！］夾得稍爲寛些。</p>
<p>車從擺渡橋上溜下去，蘇州河也擠着許多船隻。</p>
<p>一時想到衣袋裏的一本小書，便拿出來看了，翻過一幅一幅的挿畫，最後在看藤田畫伯所作的［江戶川之秋，］心裏漫然的浮起了異國的情懷。忽然展着書的那隻手的指頭上，受到了奇異的感覺，好像觸了電似的，連忙縮了回來。　　［還是請你坐罷！討厭！］我楞着眼睛斷然的在人叢中站起，面上起了陣熱。乘客的視線不期地齊向這年青人投射，有些很爲疑感，有些似乎頗有經騐似的，表示着［這當然是那麽一回事］的態度，裂了裂嘴吧。</p>
<p>到了日新樓，這可憐的東西才從容容地下了車，他是始終保持着坦然的態度的。</p>
<h3>黑女求神記（十一）</h3>
<p>— 蕭伯訥作宜閑譯</p>
<p>她將那杯子還了他，他便好像術士似的使牠不見了，於是她笑了，他也笑了。　［眞巧妙，先生］她説。［你這大麗術家。你大約是指敎着黑女什麽罷。我尋求着神啦。他］在什麽地方呢？］</p>
<p>［在你的内中，］那術士説。［也在我的内中。］</p>
<p>［我也這麽想，］那女孩子説。［但是，他是什麽呢？］</p>
<p>［是我們的父，］那術士説。</p>
<p>黑女孩子做了一個鬼臉，想了一會。於是説道，［怎麽不是我們的母呢？］</p>
<p>於是挨到那術士來做鬼臉了，他便擺了這樣的臉。［我們的母是要我們將她們帶到神的前］面的，］他説。［如果我一向是由我的母指導的，那我大約就會做到富人，不至於做流民，做］浪蕩兒的，然而我却也不會見到神了。］</p>
<p>［我的父從幼小時候就打我，直打到我大得能夠用我的［諾勃凱黎］來抵擋他］黑女孩子説；便是這以後，他也想將我賣給一個别了妻子過海來的白人兵先生。我一向不肯説，我們在天上的父］我總是説［我們的祖父。］我不要有做着我的父的神。</p>
<p>［我們還是應該彼此兄妹般相愛的，］那術士微笑着説；因爲祖父的修正這一回事將他那滑稽的感覺觸動了。而且，他是一個和氣的人，每逢好笑的時候總笑的。</p>
<p>［女人是不愛兄弟的，］黑女孩子説。［女人的心從她的兄弟轉向陌生人，有如我的心轉向］你。］</p>
<p>［哦！我們不談家族罷：這只是隱喻罷了，］那術士説。［我們是同一人類社會的分子，也］</p>
<p>可以説我是你的，你是我的分子。家族呢，我們還是任牠去罷。］</p>
<p>［我不能，先生］她説。［神告訴我啦他不管個體，姊妹，和兄弟等等。］　　［這不過是敎我們彼此相愛的一種説法罷了，］那術士説。［愛那些恨你的人罷。祝福那些］</p>
<p>咀咒你的人罷。切勿忘却兩個黑的變不到一個白的呵。］</p>
<p>［我不要個個人都愛我，］黑女孩子説。［我不能愛個個人。神對我説，我］</p>
<p>不可單因爲我厭惡人們的緣故，用我的［諾勃］凱黎］去打他們，而且，每逢人們厭惡我的時候，他們的厭惡我，不能使他們有打　我的權利。然而神却使我厭惡了許多。有一班人因爲搶奪着，殺害着别人的緣故，是同蛇一樣，必須殺掉的。］</p>
<p>［你還是不要使我想起這班人來罷，］那術士説。［這班人是使我很不愉快的。］</p>
<p>［忘却不愉快的事，這一個辦法固然是使事］事都美妙的，］黑女孩子説。［然而這却没有使］事事都可信；使事事都得當。你可是實在地，眞心地愛我的，先生？</p>
<h3>蘧廬絮語</h3>
<p>— 子展</p>
<p>（九）蕭特與朱臻仕</p>
<p>去年淞滬抗日之戰，日機六架轟炸蘇州，美國飛行家蕭特騰機與戰，不幸孤機被圍，終於被難，事至悲壯，至今國人莫能忘之。孰知三十年前，日俄將近啟釁，中國局勢極危之際，有一德國人朱臻仕者，曾爲激勵中國人而自殺耶？</p>
<p>朱臻仕者，居中國三十年，華語華服，用華文姓名，歷處江寗鎭江江陰吳淞諸地，爲砲臺總敎習，盡心於中國國事。及日俄爭奪東三省事件起，痛中國之不足有爲，居恒鬱鬱不樂，而憤俄人尤深。游滬，遇一俄人，詰以東三省事，且言俄人虐待中國，有背公理。俄人笑而答日：［君以中國事尚可爲乎？何不思之甚也］！］朱聞之愈憤。遇英人囑其調停東三省事，英人答之如俄人。朱憤甚，貌若痴。及回江寗，見中國人，卽握手告以中國前途之苦，及時改革之不可緩。華人漫應之，且有目笑存之者。一日，宴於番菜館，語及東三省事，切齒怒目，碎其杯盤。明日携槍將出，旁觀者止之，遂返，闔戶自戕。將死時，猶大呼［中國不可］救！中國不可救！］者再。侍者啟戶視之，則見其手書一紙置几上，言［朱某自戕，與中國］無涉，德人不得藉口與中國人爲難。］其眷眷於我中國如此也！</p>

<h3>標金盤旋微漲九錢</h3>
<p>金市昨日雖有數度起仆、但結果尚平穩、初因倫敦大條難無動静、但英美美英兩匯　　兑俱告跌下七五及五六二五、紐約銀價縮六二五、銀行私電小八一二五、但遠期銀價三月期雖跌七釐九、而十二月期祇小四釐六、匯市開出雖較前收微緊、但亦極少、金市開盤爲七百七十三兩半、大戶如大興永首來售去、但因人心極佳、銀行内盤亦佳、故雖降至二兩半、仍能逐步升上、大通於此際屢扖美金而漲爲六兩八錢、入後漸低、匯市亦轉平静、匯豐掛牌先令小一二五、美金跌二五、但亦不過一度回升而已、投機家吳某傾售多次、塲内如福餘等均售、更見回落、入後更因某銀行托大德成同豐恒等傾出亦多、更跌至七百七十兩、匯市此時亦較悲觀、六月份美金三七五似乎不易脱手、但人心仍佳、一轉瞬間麥加利來吃三一二五、乃漸漸好至四兩外、趨勢多見盤旋、未幾降至○五錢、恒興於此時曾代中央銀行開現一百四十條、進者似勇、乃見回至七百七十一兩九錢收盤、烚赤賣戶削價而售、遂照加十二兩、三四月掉期亦跌、貼價自三兩四錢至四兩二錢、現貨號均來掉出、蓋存底漸活、今將半日間市况誌之於後、</p>
<p>晨開爲七百七十三兩半、較前收漲起二兩　　半、匯市開出微緊、計英匯近期出價一先令八便士二五、美金二十八元八一二五、亦無十分緊勢、是以大興永上塲卽來猛售、乃自三兩八錢跌至二兩半、然因義豐永福昌兆豐昌俱來爭購、而至四兩外、恒餘更進、而爲五兩、荷囒售予三井四月份美金念八元九三七五、乃退至四兩四錢、然人心極穩、元亨及物品進至六兩、大通求結三月份美金八七五未得、更扖四月份八七五、大德成未進、哄至六兩六錢、匯市四月份美金八七五、花旗亦塞、乃退落一兩、此時盤旋殊多、迨夫升至六兩八錢後、賣戶活動、花旗售予沙遜三月份美金七月、福餘恒餘上塲脱手、爲五兩、更因麥加利塞出三月份六八七五、而降至四兩二錢、匯豐掛牌亦於此時揭曉、計先令縮二五、美金跌二五、此時趨勢盤旋、曾回上兩許、爲五兩半、三月份美金七五可結、大興永連來售條、而降至三兩内、麥加利扖六月份美金二五慶發永志豐永進至三兩外、此時瑞興曾來售、但因人心穩健之故、又見下降、福昌上塲進條、而達四兩三錢、物品套出、而盤至三兩光景、花旗肯售四月份美金九三七五、源茂永售至二兩半、兆豐昌進條、又好至三兩八錢、此後賣風頓起、大德成首先猛售、源康祥元春源新永俱賣至三兩内、福餘同豐恒售至二兩、志豐永大興永更來售條、乃跌至一兩内、六月份美金三七五、亦不易脱售、而抵七十兩、始見回上、恒餘略進、漸漸升至二兩光景、麥加利吃六月份美金三一二五、匯市仍有再佳之可能、然塲内未有多量交易、價乃盤旋而升、逐漸加至四兩四錢、此時六月份美金二五似可賣出也、無何散戶脱手、義豐永亦來賣出、而爲二兩、銀行雖乏進出、但内盤隨之略鬆、丙興猛力脱售、福昌亦出、又破一兩、而爲○五錢、此際恒興曾代中央銀行開現、金價遂不致再跌、後更微見回升、福餘恒餘亦進、乃爲二兩、未幾卽爲收盤七百七十一兩九錢、收市後恒興續代中央開現、曾至二兩外、故物品拍二兩、最後丙興仍售、又退爲一兩六七錢、查半日間最高價七百七十六兩八錢、最低價七百七十兩、有六兩八錢上落、結果較前收微漲九錢、</p>

<p>恒興在收盤時曾受中央銀行之托、前來開現二百十條、計一百四十條、價一兩、七十條二兩二錢、</p>
<p>烚赤續低、昨市開出十三兩、賣戶極多、但無人問津、入後盈豐恒肯照加十二兩售出、乃有正式成交、由大德成納進、成交不滿百兩、</p>
<p>掉期亦低、現貨號如盈豐恒乾昌祥等俱來掉出三四月、初開卽較前日爲低、瑞康貼予盈豐恒五十六條、大德成貼予乾昌祥一百四十條、俱爲四兩二錢、但乾昌祥等續肯掉出、價遂更低、盈豐恒撳價貼進、鴻興卽貼予一百四十條、價三兩六錢、大德成亦貼予盈豐恒七十條、同價、又七十條三兩半、乾昌祥更與瑞康掉七十條、祗貼進三兩四錢、恒興出乾昌祥一百○五條、價七百七十七兩、又出盈豐恒一百○五條、價七兩一錢半、俱爲三月份劃賬交易、</p>
<p>此週中波濤汹湧、轉瞬千變、良以美國銀幣提案消息紛岐、性週初最大價爲七百八十兩○三錢、翌日因有不利市塲之電訊傳來、暴跌二十兩以外、慷風慘雨、卒已打破七百六十兩關、僅計五十七兩五錢、開舊歷新正以來之低價、復後徘徊於七十兩内外、及至結果、比較上週六統核跌去九兩四錢、（全週有二十二兩八錢　）額）殆海外銀市均亦趨升、匯兑則見反動而跌、故本埠先令硬而美金平、</p>

<p>近日通州棉子、到貨尚不湧、散倉及装包兼有計洋子三千三百担、墨子一千一百担、昨已悉數成交、墨子價爲二元四角、洋子（五十斤肉份標）準）價二元六角、市面平平、查新春來自通州子外、（他地棉子、竟無到貨、）</p>
<h3>糧食米市定局景象</h3>
<p>變陰元漲一二角</p>
<p>（滬南）昨來源以攔阻到源稁毫無、零躉胃均呆滯、來源雖無、市仍定局、蘇同帮青角南港等米客寥寥、價無榮辱、杜尖定勢、陰元乏貨胃香、如松江陰元漲起二角之担、變元去路呆滯、價步修角許、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下來源缺乏、河存百三四十艘、白粳店胃續化、市形高定中次緊起近尺、薄粳早初河存無幾、價帶緊象、羊埠尖去路平常、價形定立、杜尖緊起尺許、白元去化甚呆、價又轉疲勢、</p>
<h3>客秈本銷甚旺</h3>
<p>丨南京秈繼續到申丨</p>
<p>昨客秈去化仍以本街爲主、因本街上以河下到頭被船戶中途攔阻、到源不旺、貨品不足揀選、且價格高昂、反比客秈爲昂、因此對客秈胃口、益形濃暢、客秈市面以本街之活潑、市面有上展之必要、但邇日閩化不旺、到頭續有、市面祗得扯平、統市售開江西機晚三百三十七包、又機早一百二十包、湖南機紅米一百包、又紅糙二百包、又砶油米八十二包、南京秈米邇日逐有抵埠、昨開出新到車秈二百八十六包、又糙秈二百包、其中糙米統爲福州帮辦去、其他統爲本街收進、</p>
<h3>本月粉後市軟落</h3>
<p>丨遠月略昂丨</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午各月份平穩、以洋麥報價、好起一角左右、業外人心、因時局步呈嚴重、大小廠家、均無出意、故互擯中微帶穩固、以廠家之套頭、亦防往後洋麥到源、若果發生問題、標準自須受軋、故均愼重從事也、迨至下午開盤、交易仍清、本月份因月底已近、將受交割、廠方籌碼尚多、客帮祇津帮略動、故各盤遂自然軟下、遠期各月份、大致盤旋、業内外均趨觀望、無意出入、惟抛戶甚少、市見略昂、結果本月份較前日跌七厘半、三月份未動、四月份好五厘、五六月份好七厘半、七月份不動、</p>
<h3>期麥空拍多</h3>
<p>丨不過七月期略有交易丨</p>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份呈稀有之蕭瑟景象、本月份已經交割、固無市面、三月至六月份、上下市均完全空拍、一無見交、實因内地客帮、久不問訊、套頭又不敢出籠、所以擯住不動也、祗七月份略有交易、數赤不多、價較前日微好一分、</p>
<h3>荳餅廠貨已出</h3>
<p>惟銷路尚懈</p>
<p>荳飾廠家出數見速、而去胃尚未急切、故廠方難扳善價、市况轉平、黄豆交易亦淡、惟人心甚穩、暫無榮辱、後情變遷、少有把握、昨市浦東杜豆價售開四兩七錢半、成交一百包、此乃揀篩大粒、故能開此大價、崇明沙黄福州帮胃口尚香、來源雖少、然存積尚有五六萬包堆棧貨、致市難發展、</p>
<h3>絲茶華絲運法祗二百餘件</h3>
<p>邇來法國里昂馬賽生絲市塲、因人造絲與日本絲之侵銷、致華絲法銷久無起色、滬埠運法華絲亦難轉暢、昨法郵琴納而梅静號出口、祗信孚逹昌等共有黄白絲經二百三十七件装往馬賽里昂等埠云、</p>
<p>珍眉綠茶市盤又跌</p>
<p>昨洋莊茶市、婺源高莊珍眉綠茶、英法行家、均有零星進胃、全市共計談成二百十箱、中關貨、市盤開出七十兩、較前又跌二三兩、查日來國外來價、因匯率高漲、益形緊縮、華茶商至此時期堅持力又復薄弱、茶市售價、依然有跌無漲、</p>
<h3>油市清油平凡</h3>
<p>清油以連日豆油市面不振、市平凡、本街方面、迄無進意、昨市雖有大批交易、而價則微回、成交額計一千六百八十担、担出價十二兩一錢、係本埠某大皂廠購進云、</p>
<p>五金黑鐵皮現貨軋缺</p>
<p>黑黑皮市面、近因　磁廠收羅、市風甚俏、故標準節節上升、如三張以貨缺關係、飛漲至八兩七錢半、四張八兩五錢、五張六張八兩三錢、七張八張八兩六錢、九張八兩八錢、十張九兩、十一張十二張九兩二錢半、十三張九兩五錢、二尺六尺十八張九兩五錢、惟近來現貨奇少、人心良佳、故行情一節尚再漲、聞海外定價、近甚堅硬、所以本埠行情、恐不易回移、</p>
<p>一分鋼板暴跳六錢餘</p>
<p>英鋼板市間、以到貨少定價高、市面本有向榮可能、惟近來交易蓬勃而起、致市貨青黄不替、標準步高、如二厘半開至八兩五錢、半分七兩、七厘半六兩三錢半、一分六兩三錢半、半分以上均估六兩、惟昨一分花色　形軋缺、標準暴跳有六錢之多、計每擔開六兩八錢半、而喝價七兩者亦大有人在、聞其銷路之主因、則受兵工廠之採辦所致、而客銷興旺、亦不無關係、聞最近海外定價亦要七鎊十五先令、恐本埠標準、一時不是回落</p>

<h3>川河國輪大團結</h3>
<p>抵抗洋商輪之壟斷</p>
<p>上年川戰發生時、重慶溆瀘等埠在滬定購之大批疋頭棉紗、均停止装運、積存滬上、嗣以江水减退、該項貨件、仍未装去、邇日川帮客家因戰事已停、上游水亦漸增、又恐揚子江交通、發生阻碍、遂電滬趕運貨件、因此發生洋商輪競装壟斷國輪團結抵抗之風潮、亟將概况、報告如下</p>
<h3>外輪爭航</h3>
<p>去年四川因戰事積</p>
<p>阻、在上海之貨、最多爲洋布與棉紗、近日川帮迭電上海、將該貨運去、以防長江交通發生阻碍、該項紗布、分兩路商輪運去、一爲上海到重慶直放船、一爲上海到宜昌船、再轉至渝、滬上專營川河航輪之洋商、爲捷江公司共有十二輪行駛、次爲太古怡和、亦有十輪以上、現在直放重慶、貨由捷江競載、將宜昌轉運貨、由太古怡和分運、刻在開始競航中、</p>
<h3>水脚增漲</h3>
<p>川江運費、主要爲</p>
<p>棉紗、歷年外輪爲謀打倒華商輪船、將水脚狂跌、最短時每件减到銀六兩、使川江出雲號、小輪公司、多因而停班輟業、洋商鑒於跌價主張之成功、遂於去年秋冬間、將運費又陸績提高、棉紗水脚自六兩至八兩、由八兩漲至十兩、復自十兩再漲十二兩、加出一倍、淺水時更須納特别水脚、</p>
<h3>華輪團結</h3>
<p>上年川河各小輪局</p>
<p>、受外輪排擠、而倒閉者有七八家、當時有華商民生公司、招集股資、將停航各輪全部收買、以化零爲整之主張、勿使川河航權、盡落外人手中、民生航業公司乃突然崛起、亦開行滬渝班·滬宜班·漢宜班·溆瀘班·等共有民權民主等十餘船行駛、以對抗捷江等各洋商、今次川帮趕装積貨、外輪乘機漲水脚、民生公司乃聯合招商·三北·永興·浹江渝等各華輪局、成立川河國輪大同盟、厚集力量、爭回航權、並以打破外輪之壟斷、並議定將三月一日起、將上海運往四川各地之貨件、一律跌减水脚、一面通告滬上各客家、昨日本埠各外輪公司、已接到宜昌發來急電、報告華輪大團結、已經成立、完全爲抵抗洋商輪者、應速謀挽救云云、各洋商得報、亦在密商對付之策略云、</p>
<h3>日人肇禍日捕行兇</h3>

<h3>東北協會之工作與組織</h3>
<p>二週後徴求會員明日舉行常理會</p>
<p>東北協會爲援救東北研究東北之統一團體、其目的爲援助在東北作戰之將士、調查東三省現在過去之實况、研究東北間題之解决、並聯合全國各團體、以合力協助發揮整個民族之毅力及决心、以謀東北問題之解决、當成立之初、發起人吳鐵城史量才等、已將其目的明白宣示、昨日該會全體理事更聯名宣言、詳述創立之旨趣及所負之重任、以喚醒國人上下團結、作全民族之總動員、以貫澈其目的、中央社記者爲欲明瞭該會籌劃組織之現况、特往訪該會總幹事臧啓芳氏、當得其詳爲解答如次、</p>
<h3>二件重要的工作</h3>
<p>臧氏語記者、東北</p>
<p>協會成立之宗旨、</p>
<p>在昨日發表之宣言</p>
<p>中、已經詳述、國人想已明瞭、現在我人所籌劃者、爲工作之計劃、其最重要者有二端、（一）爲如何使在東北之義勇軍能在統一領導之下、響應國軍同起奮戰、（二）爲調查東三省之近况及僞組織與日本之内情、以研究應付之策略、去歲馬占山馮占海丁超李杜等相繼出國後、東北義勇軍之氣燄、似已消沉、然在實際東北人民之枕戈待命者、尚不下二十萬之數、惟或因缺乏領導、或以給養斷絕、故匿跡深山、以待機會耳、且因日本軍憲之嚴密偵查、國内消息之不能傳達該處、故彼等雖已準備就緒、而尚未知殺敵效國之時機已經成熟也、現在熱邊大戰、已經爆發、故義軍之奮起響應、以攻其後、實爲良好之機會、如熱省國軍、能維持三月、則日本之慘敗、當在意料之中、即不幸熱省失陷、本會對義軍之後援、亦不稍减、蓋義軍在其内部作戰之效力、實較派兵收復失地爲宏大也、故本會一方固須與以領導及援助、一方更將種種消息傳遞該處、俾得應時而起、</p>
<h3>二週後徴求會員</h3>
<p>繼談及徴求會員事</p>
<p>、臧氏謂會務之籌</p>
<p>劃、大約再經二週、</p>
<p>即可就緒、故徴求會員期、亦不過遠、本會旣爲挽救東北解决東北問題之大集團、故希望全國同胞、均爲會員、吳市長曾謂東北問題、須深印全國同胞之腦中、隨時隨地加以警惕、即東北能收復後、亦勿忘東北建設之重大責任、但人壽有限、而東北問題、則恐非短時期間所能解决、故如有東北協會之存在、雖傳至吾子吾孫、亦必不忘東北也、至其組織、更須求普及全國、各地會員均成立分會、其内部組織、將視需要而增設若干特種委員會、上次理事會决定之外交委員會、已在着手進行中、將來對東北之國際問題、詳加調查及研究、以貢獻政府參考、其他如經濟委員會參謀委員會等、亦將次第成立、以研究各種專門問題、</p>
<h3>明日舉行常理會</h3>
<p>臧氏末謂、本會已</p>
<p>定於明日（星期一）</p>
<p>午後四時半、假市</p>
<p>政府召集第一次常務理事會、討論一切進行事宜、至於會址、原擬附設中國航空協會内、現因該會房屋不敷應用故、故已另行覓定、俟修葺後、即可遷入辦公云、</p>
<h3>唐有壬之時局談</h3>
<p>汪返國否無確訊</p>
<p>參政會條例待議</p>
<p>僞組織將起内變</p>
<p>中央政治會議秘書長唐有壬、於昨日八時乘車來滬、記者特往訪於寓邸、叩以下列各事、據氏答復如下、</p>
<h3>國民參政</h3>
<p>國民參政會議原則、已</p>
<p>經中央政治會議通過、</p>
<p>惟其手續尚多、仍將送</p>
<p>交立法院研究、</p>
<h3>汪氏反國</h3>
<p>行政院長汪精衛返國日</p>
<p>期、大約將在三月十五</p>
<p>日前後、因近日尚無電</p>
<p>告、故是否由意大利乘輪及馬賽返國、則不可知、</p>
<h3>僞起内變</h3>
<p>近據華北傳來消息、僞</p>
<p>組織將於三月九日臨時</p>
<p>僞執政就職一週年時、</p>
<p>决定僭號稱帝、惟溥儀左右、如袁金凱·鄭孝胥·等、主張意見頗多不洽、因鄭孝胥近覺日人每每遇事攘奪、在溥儀前進言少用日人、日人因此頗有去鄭之心、察僞組織不久内部或將發生變化云、</p>
<h3>召回公使</h3>
<p>中日關係、在此時成爲</p>
<p>不和不戰、亦和亦戰之</p>
<p>局勢、而完全爲一事實</p>
<p>問題、即彼如來攻我即抵抗、若在此時召回日使、適足以紛亂國聯工作之步驟、故暫時尚未致實現也云云、</p>
<h3>日退國聯</h3>
<p>日本之退出國聯、以國</p>
<p>聯報告書所予日本之迴</p>
<p>旋餘地、及日本内部之</p>
<p>種種問題觀之、日本尚難對國聯毫無顧慮、而即行退出、故日本之是否退出國聯、必須於三月後方能覘其究竟、此時至難斷言也、</p>

<h3>政府决心改革幣制</h3>
<p>準備三月一日起兩元並用</p>
<p>錢業公會昨特開大會討論</p>
<p>廿八日中政會通過後公佈</p>
<p>財政部爲整理幣制實行廢兩改元、自去年組織委員會、專事研究規劃、二月初財長宋子文與銀錢業領袖商定三月一日起兩元並用、至七月一日起、則完全廢去銀兩制、錢業領袖俞佐庭·秦契卿·今晨語新聲社記者、以此次宋財長來滬、曾對錢業領袖談財部對整理幣制之决心、及錢業之準備與意見、與昨日下午三時、錢業開會員代表大會、討論决定各情、茲分誌如下、</p>
<h3>政府决心</h3>
<p>財政部長宋子文在滬</p>
<p>時、二十三日曾與錢業領袖晤談、表示整理幣制、財部具有决心、廢兩改元、必須實行、錢業方面、亦深明政府之苦心孤詣、决如期遵行、兩元並用之期、確定爲三月一日、須經提出本月二十八日中央政治會議通過後、由國府明令公佈、</p>
<h3>生銀借欵</h3>
<p>幣制條例草案、亦經財</p>
<p>政部草擬完竣、將提出二十八日中政會通過、交立法院討論通過公布、財部爲整理幣制鼓鑄新幣、向美國貸生銀五萬萬盎司之幣制借欵、仍在進行中、</p>
<h3>三行調劑</h3>
<p>自下月份起、兩元並用</p>
<p>法價、定爲七一五、以後洋厘、無復每日不同之市價、但外商銀行仍以銀兩爲本位、故對外貿易上、仍須用銀兩、而昔之以因供應多寡而起之洋厘旣廢、將由中央中國交通三銀行負調劑之責、商人之須用銀兩者、可照法價向上列三銀行購買、惟銀元不敷時、可用銀兩鑄造、設銀兩不敷、如以銀元回鑄、則須損失百分之一二、此項虧折之數、財部已準備賠償、</p>
<h3>增加洋拆</h3>
<p>昨日下午三時、錢業公</p>
<p>會開會員代表大會、議决、自三月一日起、除原有銀拆外、增加洋拆、兩洋本位、仍各照舊、同時存在、對實行劃銀洋法價、待政府明令實行而散、至七月一日起、即將廢除銀兩本位、悉改爲銀元云、</p>
<h3>兩業意見</h3>
<p>至銀錢兩業、對廢兩改</p>
<p>元之意見、銀行業方面當然甚表贊同、錢業方面則頗顧慮銀元能否足敷應用、而中央造幣廠鼓鑄能力、是否能應社會金融之需要、須試行若干時期後、始能得實際經騐、倘無甚大窒碍、當亦贊同、</p>
<h3>三新經理盛麐上訴無罪</h3>
<p>酬勞分配經理自有酌定之權</p>
<p>前三新紗廠經理盛玉麐、於該廠出售時、將廢銅等向購定變價三萬元、令總管孫鶴儕分酬各職員、嗣因分配不匀、致發生該廠職員余和聲·余國驤·陳竹·控訴盛侵占於第一特院之案件、審理結果、認盛有背俱嫌疑、判處罰金三百元、盛奉判不服、上訴於高二分院、將原判撤銷、宣告無罪、此案關於商界經理酌分職員酬勞辦法、關係甚巨茲特覓錄高一分院判决理由書、抄錄於下、本案屬三新紡織公司所有之舊鐵與廢銅、爲該廠總管孫鶴儕悉敷售出、及其所得之售價、除朱道記一戶、與賬單中收數相差小洋一角外餘與收賬並支配數目相符、業爲原審會計師核算明確、報告在案、該報告書内、關於支出之部、其付出陳竹亭·余和生·余自省·顧詠蘭·邵長春·孫翌·等各欵雖未取有收據、爲之證實、但經孫鶴儕在原審供明、如何未能取得收據之在原因、卽陳竹亭所收一級洋四十八元、並未否認、余自省亦稱二百元與五百五十元、是拿到的、收據是没有等語、則孫所付之未有收據各欵、已難謂爲虚僞、縱有未實、而出售廢料、收支欵項、旣爲孫一人所經手、與盛玉麐無關、此點又爲俞國驤所明白供認、充其量亦不過盛玉麔未盡監督之能事、何能指爲共同侵占或背信情弊、况上訴人等旣將孫鶴儕自訴部分撤回、不願有所深究、反而對於嫌欵較輕之盛玉麔、始向社會局請求救濟、繼向原審　起自訴、判决後、又因處刑過輕不服而上訴、其居心何在、更難索解、至盛玉麐批給孫鶴儕洋二千元、及分净餘欵八百六十一元一角七分、孫所得之酬金、固較各職員爲獨多、然其居於總管地位、年資亦較各職員爲深、此次能將該廠已出賣之廢料、得收回變價、資助於舊有職員者、均係孫與買主情商所以、有吳昆生之復函可核、盛玉麐身爲經理、自已旣不願有所分潤、將其特殊勞續之孫鶴儕、提給二千元、及所分净之餘欵併而與之以資酬勞、不得謂非事理之平、目據上海市商會調查、商號職員、酬勞之分配、經理自有酌定之權、爲商事上一種普遍之習慣、益無何等刑事嫌疑之可言、原判執此一點爲判處盛玉麐背信罪之論據、殊屬違誤、基上論結、本件被告之上訴爲有理由、自訴人等之上訴雖無理由、而原判亦有一部未當、將該部份予以撤銷、被告盛玉麐應依刑事訴訟法第三百七十九條三百五十七二三百十六條規定諭知無罪、並依同法三百八十五條第一項判决如主文、審判長推事郁華·推事趙鉦鏜·周翰、</p>

<h3>最後的抗爭</h3>
<p>— 鐸非</p>
<p>日本帝國主義者以殘暴的武力，佔領我們的滿洲，轟炸我們的淞滬，窺觎我們的熱河，最近又進兵關内，攻陷我們的山海關九門口，威脅我們的平津；使我們全國人人民深切的感到國亡無日，大家不得不一致投袂奮起，對於我們的强敵，作最後殊死的抗爭。</p>
<p>我們店員在此情勢危急之下，應當怎樣呢？</p>
<p>有人説：一我們店員受着經濟的壓迫，爲個人的生活，尚且苦鬥不遑，誰也理會不到國家興敗存亡的事。］要知道等到眞亡了國實行做亡國奴的那一天·縱然可以含羞忍辱偷生苟活下去，做這樣的人，活着也没有什麽意義，倒不如率性死了還覺痛快些！</p>
<p>有人問：［猶太民族没有國家，還不是一樣的生存在世界上嗎？］要知道，猶太民族是世界上最富於智慧的民族，因爲没有國家，不能得着國家的保護，在世界上到處受人嫉視，受人迫害，現在想謀復國，終於不能。在世界未達到大同的那一天，國家就是我們民族寄托生命的集團，絕對不能容人家來侵害，必須要誓死保全牠。我們中國因爲無組織，不知團結，民族到處尚且受人鄙視，受人虐待，如果連國也亡了，那麽我們中華民族將來所受的慘痛，不知要比猶太民族更甚若干倍呢！現在的高麗人印度人，就是我們中國人的大鏡子。　　有人問：［我們店員無拳無勇，呌我們怎樣去愛國？怎樣去抗日呢？］要知道，所謂抗日，並不是呌全國人都肩着槍到前綫上去厮殺，祇要每一個人就他的能力所能夠做得到的範圍以内，努力去做就成。［排貨］就是我們店員能力可以做得到的戰術，如果大家不購用日貨，不售賣日貨，就可以使日本遧國主義者的商業大受打擊，經濟增加恐慌，促成他們帝國主義的自行崩潰滅亡。</p>
<p>有人問：［不購用日貨，我們本人還可辦到，如果我們店主貪圖利厚，暗］進日貨，我們店員反對不肯售賣，豈不是要被歇掉生意嗎？］要知道［不購用日貨］一句話，不是口頭上説説，便算完事，必須要切切實實的去行！如果我們購用一件日貨，就無異於送給敵人幾個金錢多製幾粒子彈，多殺害我們前線上幾個戰士。店主貪利忘義，暗進日貨，如果没有我們店員助紂爲虐，也不能成功；我們聯合同店的店員大家不帮助他做這亡國的勾當，店主却也奈何我們不得，他也决不敢爲此而歇掉我們的生意；如果我們察出他有這種無恥的行爲暗進日發，我們可以密函負有制裁責任的機關，使他無從施其技倆。這是我們店員愛國抗日的一個最低最低限度的辦法，如果你還説辦不到，那麽祗好請你！準備做亡國奴！準備做日本帝國主義者的亡國奴！準備你的子子孫孫永遠做日本帝國主義者的亡國奴！</p>
<p>工商界生活</p>
<h3>銀行小行員生活　鈔票間</h3>
<p>哼</p>
<p>［點鈔票的時候，］當點心。這不是好玩的，一張就是五塊，十塊，缺了數目没話講，自已掏腰包。初次幹這個玩意兒，格外要仔細。］老吳這樣對他説。</p>
<p>［怕什麽，我居心不偷，怎］麽會缺數？］他昻着頭回答，身子直挺地跟着老吳走進了鈔票間。鈔票間在地下一層，四週是灰白色的水門汀，除去了三四個小鐵窗，一半露在地面上，此外黑黝黝的得不着一線光明。電燈很亮的照耀着。潮濕的地板上，一隻一隻的白木箱，静悄悄地蹲着。紅的，綠的鈔票，渾身被麻繩緊緊的綁着，一束束像草紙捆。堆在桌上，對面看不見人。</p>
<p>［這樣多！］他開始不能忍耐地喊起來。</p>
<p>［這能算多麽。你還没看見庫裏的］鈔票箱，重重疊疊的堆在那裏，在像雜貨舖裏的火柴盒。］老吳帶笑地拍着他的肩膀説。</p>
<p>［他媽的！］他憤憤地低聲説，彷彿在表示極端的不平。［窮人睜大着眼睛］像銅鈴，終年巴不到一張，……］</p>
<p>［少説些！］老吳牽一下他的衣襟，他也就不響了。他們走進了另一間，那裏面縱横的擺着幾張公事桌，他在老吳桌子的對面坐下了。桌子上，東西很簡單，一把剪刀，一個漿糊罐，幾捆麻繩，還有一個養着海綿的綠水盂，和幾十張豆腐塊似的小白紙。據老吳説，這都是點鈔票時用的傢伙。</p>
<p>［當心些點，這是一萬整數。］老吳遞過來一個鈔票，這樣吩咐他，［點好］了，五千一捆疊起來，用麻繩緊緊的捆好，在扣結的地方，貼上方紙塊，簽個名，這捆鈔票的數目就歸你負責了。］　　［我知道。］他回答着，就用剪刀剪開了麻繩，取出來一疊，用兩隻手撩住了钞票邊角，便悉悉索索地點起來。他很小心，因爲硬的鈔票，點起來很滑，點過一百，他疑疑惑惑地彷彿裏面缺了一張，便又取過來重新點過。</p>
<p>［慢慢的，鈔票滑可以薦點水再點］。］老吳抬起頭來説，［這鈔票點起來］是不容易的呀！我們是不要緊的，我們已經點熟了，就是閉上眼睛也能點。少説些，點過的鈔票，何止幾千萬？］説着，臉上浮出了得意的笑容。</p>
<p>［有幾千萬麽？］</p>
<p>［這並不是同你吹牛，幾千萬足有］，但總是人家的，點到現在，我只不過把幾個指頭點得又粗又大，我常想，將來没事做，回去點草紙好了。］老吳有點感慨了。</p>
<p>他點過了四千，桌子上還堆着幾疊没點，不知道還有多少，他只覺得是越點越多了。同時空氣悶人，呼吸有點急促，他不能暢暢快快地吸一口氣。然而那種令人作嘔的霉氣，混雜着漿糊的酵氣，還是不斷地往他算腔裏送。他底心上好像壓着一塊鉛餅，漸漸地沉重了！他底腦子也發漲。他懊悔不該來這裏了。他想男子漢應該站在光明正大的地方，幹一番爽爽快快的事。如今却躱在這不見陽光的鈔票間裏，連一點自由空氣都呼吸不到，未免太悶人了！［他媽的］，誰耐煩幹這没出息的事！］他暗駡着。他很想把鈔票慣下來不幹，但這樣是要打碎飯碗的。坐在前面的老吳，也好像知道了他底心思一般，便嘆息地對他説：［吃這一碗飯，受罪不算，還要成］天的提心弔胆。大點意就賠錢。有時候，自已小心謹愼地點，别人會出你槍花，説是在你經手點的鈔票裏，發現缺了多少多少。賠錢不算，還要落個壞名。但我們明知道這裏的苦情，還是情願幹這件事。我們好像把缺鈔票，賠錢，壞名譽，看得不算什麽一回事了。你在這裏多幹些時候，也會和我一樣的。你們學堂裏畢業的學生，不是很多的來這裏嗎？有的人情願不念書，想跨這道門檻，還跨不進。大家都想到銀行裏來發財……發財……發財的自然也有，不過只是……］</p>
<p>他覺得老吳底話説得很不錯，他自已也抱着這種心思跑來的。他聽見那些</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>在銀行裏賺到幾個錢的人説，銀行是怎樣好的地方，在那裏差不多到處都是洋錢鈔票，在的好，吃的好，年底還有紅，只要誠實實地能夠耐勞苦，一定可以高陞，行員，主任，經理，逐步升上去，會有一個很好的前程的。這樣的傳説，爪住了他底老年的母親的心，於是又説服了他，使他也做着這發財的夢。但别人説的好處，究竟在什麽地方呢？他所幹的職務，只是四塊錢一月的練習生，整天的蹲在這悶人的屋子裏點鈔票，這别人以前並不曾對他説過，他現在開始疑惑起來了。</p>
<p>［怎麽樣？你就點不動了！］老吳很驚異地問他：［馬上就要吃晚飯了，點］快些，不要再躭擱時間。］</p>
<p>聽了老吳的話，他吃了一驚，像剛從夢裏醒過來一般。他並不答話，也不再思想，就繼續地點了。</p>
<p>吃過晚養，他們繼續地點着鈔票，手脚都很快。他明白這是他第一次工作的成績，也就是他前程的開始。他想，要是他的兩隻手，變成一副活機器，那麽一張張的鈔票，便會飛一般的從他底手中點過，十萬，百萬，甚至一箱子，都可以在一天很快的點了，這樣，他底幻夢也就會實現了。加薪水，升主任，升經理，在他眼前，浮起了金色的霞彩。點啊！點啊！不可遏止的慾望，在胸膛裏呌起來了。他覺得他底全身部活動了，他把袖子捲起，一雙手拿了一疊鈔票，便一五一十的點起來。點出汗來了，他還是不住的點。</p>
<p>［慢點罷，快了容易缺數。］老吳在對面呌他。他於是住了手，掉頭看老吳，老吳仍然低着頭。那瘦得看見顴骨的臉上，赤露著一條一條的青筋，都帶了微微的顫動。</p>
<p>［你還剩這一點嗎？點得眞快！］老吳帶笑問他。他含笑地點頭。</p>
<p>［你這樣的出力做事，説不定將來］升得快。不過此地行裏是這樣，來頭大的，馬屁拍得好的，一加薪水就是幾十塊。一聲不響埋頭做事的，加起來頂多四隻洋。我在這裏幹了差不多十年，只有二十多塊錢薪水。請問，生活這樣高，一大家人口，我又常常生病，怎樣能維持？我是没有别的辦法，否則，我是不肯在此地的。］老吳這一番話，簡直是一盆冷水，澆熄了他底慾望的火燄。　　［眞的麽？］他驚懼地問。</p>
<p>［這我有什麽騙你，我告訴你，還］有一件事説起來才傷心呢。這裏從前有個老張，他已經有二十多歲了。進來時，也是四隻洋的練習生，在這裏點鈔票。人倒很老實。有一次大了點意，人家交給他的鈔票，没有點着大數，晚上拚起數來，缺了一千，經理呌他賠，不賠開除他，還要照數拿出錢來。他回家拚命地凑了幾百塊錢，算没有把他開除。他常常對氏説，他眞寃枉死了，有苦説不出來，他很情願把錢賠清，不幹了，討飯也情願的。他後來眞刻苦，拿晚飯錢，不吃飯，啃燒餅，自已洗衣裳。進來的時候，一副笑嬉嬉又白又胖的面孔，後來黄瘦了許多，又得了吐血的毛病。去年錢才賠清，回到家鄉去了。不知道後來怎樣，但有人説他已死了……］　　這時他底心情已經改變了，先前的希望消失了。一方面身體底疲倦，一方面老吳的話語把他底幻想剝奪了。不管老吳是否和他開玩笑，老吳本人就是個例子。他發了財嗎？他升到經理嗎？一點也不對。在十年勞苦地工作了以後，結果，是換到了一個有肺病象徴的身體。難道他將來也會得到像老吳一樣的結果嗎？誰能夠説不會？他想到這裏，愈覺得心内摇摇無主。悲哀與恐怖佔據了他底頭腦，他底頭腦昏亂了，一幕一幕地在映著：［鈔票間……缺鈔票……賠錢……壞］名譽……開除……得肺病……墳墓……他覺得未來的前途，充滿了危險，他在恐怖着。他已没有精神再去點那桌子上面剩餘的幾百鈔票。還是老吳在對面呌他：［不要發呆，時候不早了，我們再來動手罷！］他底頭腦才清醒，他低下頭去了。</p>

<h3>應讀點什麽小説？</h3>
<p>— 神父</p>
<p>抛開［江湖會俠傳］和［啼笑姻緣］，　　讀點［三部曲］［鐵流］一類的書吧！</p>
<p>店員們在有空閒的時候，也常常拿起一本小説來消遣消遣，這消遣的讀物中，據我最近的發現，要算［江湖奇俠］傳］和［啼笑姻緣］流行最廣。</p>
<p>店員們之喜歡讀［江湖奇俠傳］和［啼笑姻緣］是和小市民們愛看帶恐怖性的獸片的電影，有同樣的理由，那就是，［逃避現實］</p>
<p>店員們是屬於社會間的小資産階級的一層，小資産階級根本就是一個摇動，不安的階級，固然，有最少數的可以僥倖的爬上高高的一層，變做了眞正的資産階級，但大多數仍是摇動，不安，苦悶，没有出路，而終於幻滅，没落！　　這摇動，不安，苦悶，没有出路的我們，尤其是生在中國現代的我們，因爲有其他種種的原因，對於現實更是大大的不滿，苦悶而没有辦法的情緒格外高漲，結果，乃在離開實際生活十萬八千里和離開時代不知若干年的書中，去尋找另一個世界，片刻的幻覺和莫明其妙的玫瑰色的迷夢，於是［江湖奇俠傳］和［啼笑姻緣］便在很廣的流行着。</p>
<p>但這些書所給我們的究竟是些什麽？那也不過是些幻覺後的悲酸和迷夢後</p>

<h3>自動機器能代店友乎</h3>
<p>— 祖同</p>
<p>近來自動機器，花樣翻新，有投一錢而出一粒糖者，亦有投銀圓一分而出一分郵票者。醉心機器學者，曾倡議各店装置自動機器，以替代店友，此種偏見，苟店友而僅能做現成之交易，自以採用機器，較之雇用店友，更爲節省，惟交易非盡屬簡單如售糖與郵票之類，則店友固未可全廢，而仍有應行存在之價值也。茲申論其理由於下：</p>
<p>（一）指導顧客顧客對於一店之各貨之應用，不易盡知，非俟店友之反覆陳述，難明底藴。西諺有云：［店夥爲人民之指導者，生活程度，藉以促進。］誠有意味之言也！</p>
<p>（二）根於習慣顧客每入店門，見店友在，與談交易，周旋應對，相習已久，故改用機器代店友，實爲不可能之事。</p>
<p>（三）脱售貨品貨品之不能自賣者極夥，若保險生意，縫衣機器，與音樂器具等等，非經店友兜銷不可。至遇競爭發生時，尤賴店友之售賣能力者居多。有目販賣人爲商業公使者，則店友之關係重要，可想見矣！</p>
<p>（四）提高貨價　貨品之價值，每須由良好之販賣術以提高之，在店友因屬煞費苦心，在顧客亦因用途頗多，貨價加增，不以爲苛。</p>
<p>（五）吸引顧客良好之店友，對於購者有保舊招新之能力，店中營業全賴維持，爲一時不可缺之人才。的凄楚而已，最多的還是［無聊］。</p>
<p>所以，我們要立刻把牠們抛開，去找些可以呌出我們辛酸的，道出我們苦痛的，而又能給我們以辦法的讀物。這裏，我暫且就拿茅盾的［三部曲］和外國貨的［鐵流］來做個代表吧。</p>
<p>茅盾的［三部曲］充分的道出了小資産階級的不安和没落，確能代表我們的呼聲，但可惜牠亦不過［僅此而已］，依舊是没有出路而毫無辦法的。</p>
<p>［鐵流］是一部外國小説，中國也有譯本。這書中是充滿了［力］［動］和［奮］鬥］，牠的啓示是：［奮鬥可以圖存，］　　苟安就是滅亡二，一羣求生的人鐵一般的在向前走着，這正是我們求生的一條大道。</p>
<p>換一換口味吧，我這樣祈求着。</p>

<h3>小船重載</h3>
<p>— 朱曾威</p>
<p>編者先生：自從貴欄出世以來，我常常看到許商店裏的學徒，他們都説老闆或經理只知道呌他們當雜差，對於切身的商業經騐，一點没有機會學習；這當然要使他們失望的。但是我的情形却大不相同了。我今年才十七歲。去年九月，由親友介紹至本埠某紗號習業。半因爲我是一個初中已經畢業的人，對於普通寫算，尚可應付，兼之生性尚不十分愚魯，一切都能一學便會；但一半也爲了我的保證人，非常可靠；所以承老闆的情，逾格重用。進店不到一月，就敎我做帮賬；後來實缺的賬房先生，因爲死了老婆，請假回里，他就老實不客氣的呌我代理。直到大結束的時候，這實缺賬房才來銷假；總計我代理賬席的時間，竟有三個月左右。在這個時期内，一則因爲事事有老闆在旁，同事們也不敢使刁；二則因爲一切事情，有原來的賬房先生，立下規模，蕭規曹隨，當然没有困難；所以没有出過岔子。現在老闆在外埠創設了一爿分店，裏面的職員，新進來的也有，從老店裏派過去的也有；我呢，居然被派爲分店司賬。分店的規模，當然與總店有别，敎我怎樣去辦呢？同事們見我年輕識淺，兼之老闆並不在旁，難保不有意作難。分店的賬房，身分當然很高，全權在握：可是責任也非常鄭重，惟我是問。所以我就向老闆婉辭，俾可在老闆跟前，再學幾年。那知他老人家大不爲然，説我爲着薪水菲薄（每月五元），不肯替他效勞，心存怨望。呀！這眞天曉得了！我是以學徒自居的，每月有五元收入，已經受寵若驚，那裏還敢怨望。不過小船重載，自已實在不能相信自已呀！不去好呢，還是去好呢？請高明的編者先生替我一决罷。（下略）朱曾威謹上</p>
<p>編者按：大才小用，固屬恨事；但小船重載，必致顚覆，危險殊甚。朱君雖説安寫算尚有根底，但商塲閲歷，未免過差。在總店裏，因爲有老闆指導，幸未隕越，現在呌他去獨當一面，那裏可以使得呢？幸喜朱君有自知之明，不爲虚榮所動，這的確是他高人一等之處。希望他能夠審愼到底，好在老闆方面，總不會因此而歇他的生意的。同時希望他的老闆，允許朱君的請求，遴選幹員，去辦這分號的事務。那末非但朱君可以循序漸進，不致有爬得高，跌得重的危險，就是分號的前途，也比較有望。倘使定要逼朱君前去硬幹，那末，朱君不免要受犧牲；雖説保證人確是可靠，但是爲了老闆調度失當，恐怕也能完全負責呢。</p>

<p>每天，每天，我看見有　　許許多多的手在我面前顫動地伸着。</p>
<p>那不是錢來伸手，不勞而獲的安閒的手：也不是捧香檳盃，打高而夫球的游蕩的手；更不是幽居大飯店中；在女人腿上作［夜的巡禮］的淫亂的手；那是，唉！可憐！那是，乾枯的，抖索的，灰白色的，缺乏營養的，懦弱的手！　　［編輯先生，請你把我的稿子在自］我職業介紹欄内發表了罷！我失了業已好久啦！這般手兄手弟們常常對我這麽説，還帶着乞憐的聲口。</p>
<p>但是，請你們恕我，恕我，一切勞苦的手先生們呀！我雖然已經把你們的稿子披露了，但我究竟能帮助你們一些什麽呢？這行將就木的現社會又給你們一些什麽呢，除了把飢餓，痛苦，壓迫，死亡放入你們掌中之外？在這千百隻的手中間，能藉着報紙的力量僥倖地找到工作做的，恐怕還不到百分之一呀！其餘的，還不是依然空閒着，空虚得彷彿失落了一件什麽寳貴的東西似的嗎？　　幸而，我所看得到，接觸得到的，還不過是這千百隻的手：如果再加上全世界三千萬失業工人以及數萬萬其他失業者的手，那我雙目怕要失明了吧！　　每天，每天，我看見有許許多多的手在我面前顫動地幌着。</p>
<p>可憐！牠們只是一天天的瘦小起來，差不多快要爬到飢餓線上去了！有時，我眞想握着。們，灑一把同情的涙，但有時，我却又憤怒起來。</p>
<p>［你們這般愚蠢的手，你們難道没］有翻過地圖，不知道這地球上有一個没有失業的國家，還缺少幾百萬的工人嗎？］我想着，可是偉大的法律與宗敎壓在我的頭上，我怕！我怕！終於没有説出口來。我只能學着帝國主義的口吻，大聲疾呼的説：［蘇聯是一個强迫勞動］的國家，你們不要相信牠！］</p>
<p>全世界善良的［上等人］呀！請你們放出一些慈悲心來，救救這般手君和手女士，援［手］！援［手］！你看，牠們並没有反抗你們；牠們是最馴良不過的，像是從來没有握緊過拳頭，從來不曾以手還手，也從來没有［打倒］過誰；牠們早已把所受的壓迫和痛苦置之一勞，完全忘掉了！一切大砲，飛機，機關槍，流滬彈，對於牠們簡直是毫無用處。牠倔只是哀求！哀求！現在，牠們都安分守已的在我的寫字檯上静伏着不動，牠們不會［反動］，更不會［暴動］。你看，牠們是多麽的温柔，多麽的可愛！可是，牠們又是多麽的瘦小，多麽的可憐！快！快！援［手］！援［手］！把飯碗給牠們！喔，喔，你看，你看，有一個是已經死了！</p>
<p>［編輯先生，鄙人前代敝友志會君寄奉一稿，蒙在自我職業介紹欄内發表，甚感！惟久久未見回音，甚爲焦急。現彼忽於前晚投浦自盡……。］</p>
<p>説也奇怪，這世界似乎只需要那些用黄金鍍成的肥肥的手。</p>

<h3>The Japanese Army Begins a General Offensive on the Hot Border, Fierce Battles in Chaoyang and Lingnan</h3>
<p>Enemy Air Force Fully Deployed</p>
<p>Japanese Army Feints East, Attacks West, Aiming for Chifeng and Lingyuan</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Elite Troops Airlifted into Lingnan</p>
<p>Tang Has Sent Troops to Reinforce and Will Personally Go to the Front Lines</p>
<p>(Beiping) The invading Japanese army in Rehe launched a general offensive on the 25th. Our regular army has dispatched reinforcements from Chifeng to intercept the enemy near Kailu. Fierce battles are raging on the Chaoyang front, and Lingnan is also in the midst of intense fighting. The Japanese troops attacking Lingnan, sent from Suizhong over the mountains and from Guiguan, total more than 20,000, making the situation extremely urgent. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The left-wing Japanese troops and the rebel Cheng Guorui's forces have advanced from Lishuitang to attack Lingnan, and have now made contact with our Lingnan garrison and local militias. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Xing Wu, stationed in Kailu, urgently telegraphed Tang yesterday, reporting that the newly arrived Japanese 3rd and 92nd Divisions from Tongliao, with the rebel Zhang Haipeng as their vanguard, are fiercely attacking us. Kailu and Fuxin are in dire straits. A certain volunteer army unit in western Rehe is marching at full speed to reinforce, boosting morale greatly. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegram: The enemy's land and air forces were fully deployed on the morning of the 25th. Aircraft have reached all along the Rehe border. Three aircraft each arrived in Yebanshou and Lingnan for reconnaissance, each for about an hour. Yebanshou dropped three bombs, and Lingnan dropped more than twenty bombs, damaging many civilian houses. Four aircraft flew over Lingyuan for thirty minutes, dropping more than twenty bombs, injuring more than ten people, and strafing the ground with machine guns, killing seven donkeys. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lingnan telephone: On the morning of the 24th, more than 300 Japanese cavalry were discovered near Yaowangmiao and Qingshanling in the Second District, and were repelled head-on by the local militia led by Commander Dong. The enemy army, numbering more than 3,000, is now advancing towards the Rehe border from Lishugou. Liu Xiangjiu, commander of the 106th Brigade, has established defenses in sections within Lingnan. On the afternoon of the 24th, four Japanese aircraft dropped bombs on Yingliufu and the Lingnan Administrative Bureau. Many civilian houses in Lingnan were destroyed by the bombing, and the situation is serious. We have dispatched two brigades to reinforce and have established defenses between Lingnan and Lingyuan to hold the line. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army, using a feint attack, launched a large-scale offensive on Beipiao and Chaoyang, then suddenly deployed elite troops in sixty armored vehicles, advancing from Chaoyang towards Sanglinzi in Lingnan, intending to attack Lingyuan. These large numbers of Japanese soldiers have now made contact with our army at Dagaokan in Lingnan, and fierce battles are raging. The Japanese 3rd Cavalry Regiment is also attacking Beizhangyingzi from Suizhong, putting Lingyuan under great pressure. At the same time, Japanese aircraft flew from Suizhong to bomb various strategic points in the Lingnan area. Our army is fighting a desperate battle. The fighting in Chaoyang is still intense. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed Ping on the 24th, stating that fighting had broken out on the Lingyuan border, and Lingnan and Kailu were under great tension. The Japanese army is preparing to attack Chifeng from Kailu in the north and Lingyuan from Lingnan in the south. The Japanese army is now using motor vehicles for transportation, abandoning the railway line. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The sixty armored vehicles carrying Japanese soldiers that left Jinzhou yesterday morning advanced towards Lingnan last night. Japanese troops were discovered shelling Lingnan this morning, provoking us. We are fully prepared and vow to fight back fiercely. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Now that the Japanese army has begun its attack on Kailu, the war in Rehe has taken on a clear form. The attack on Kailu seems to be aimed at Chifeng, located one hundred miles northwest of Chengde, while the advance on the Chaoyang area seems to be aimed at Lingyuan, located less than one hundred miles northwest of Shanhaiguan. Chifeng and Lingyuan are two key passes for entering the central part of the province. If the Chinese army wishes to put up effective resistance, it must spare no sacrifice to defend these two mountain passes. The defense of Lingyuan is particularly solid. According to foreign military experts, the Chinese army there is determined to resist the Japanese army for at least several weeks, or even indefinitely. The Japanese advance on Kailu is developing rapidly, but there are volunteer forces guarding the area between Tongliao and Kailu, so they must first fight the volunteer forces before encountering real resistance from the Chinese army. The Japanese offensive on Chaoyang is currently not attracting much attention, so the Japanese are now attempting a large-scale encirclement to the south, to pressure Lingyuan. However, according to official reports, the Japanese efforts have made little progress. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, a report from Tang Yulin was received here, stating that the Japanese and [Manchu] armies are currently actively attacking Rehe, but as of today, the Japanese army has not yet made contact with regular Chinese troops, having only encountered volunteer forces so far. These hardy volunteer forces, in the icy and snowy north, will inflict significant blows on the Japanese army. The Japanese army encountered fierce resistance from the Chinese army when approaching Chaoyang Temple. Due to the strength of the Chinese lines, the Japanese frontal attack has failed. Currently, Japanese troops are attempting to encircle from the south, with Lingyuan as their target. Japanese reinforcements are still moving from Suizhong towards Rehe, clearly also aiming for Lingyuan. The fighting in Kailu is also intensifying. It is estimated that the total number of Japanese troops is at least 60,000 or more. In addition, there are some [Manchu] troops participating in the fighting. The Japanese air force is currently having difficulty deploying due to the bad weather, making it difficult for Japanese aircraft to conduct reconnaissance and bombing operations. The reports of a mutiny by Chinese troops in Rehe, circulated earlier in Tokyo, have been strongly denied here. According to a military expert from a European country who recently returned from Rehe, the Chinese defenses are very well-established, and if they can be well-maintained, the Japanese army would need to increase its forces by more than twice the current total in order to effectively launch an attack. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to official reports, Japanese aircraft again bombed Chaoyang fiercely from the sky, killing many civilians and destroying countless houses. Japanese aircraft are also conducting reconnaissance in the Chifeng area every day, but are afraid to fly low due to heavy anti-aircraft fire. Official reports also state that after the Japanese frontal attack on Chaoyang failed, they have withdrawn and are reorganizing at Chaoyang Temple. Another column from Suizhong is advancing on Lingnan, intending to threaten the rear of the Chinese army in Chaoyang. However, the Lingnan area is mountainous, and the Japanese must advance through narrow mountain valleys. Machine guns are densely placed on the surrounding mountains, firing down from a commanding position, making it impossible for the enemy to overcome this natural barrier. According to news from Linyu, 4,000 [Manchu] soldiers have arrived in the area from Suizhong to aid the Japanese army. The reports of the fall of Kailu have not been verified. Official reports were still being received from there last night, stating that Manchu and Mongolian troops had repeatedly attempted to advance, but were repelled. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Kailu, 7:00 PM on the 24th: Heavy snow has fallen for days, and the weather is at twelve degrees below zero, but the fighting between the two sides is extremely fierce today. This morning, a large number of Mongolian bandit cavalry, under the cover of Japanese artillery fire, launched three fierce attacks on our positions from Bilin Temple. Our Cui Brigade responded appropriately, inflicting heavy casualties on the Mongolian cavalry, but they were ultimately unsuccessful. Later, a large force of Japanese and rebel coalition troops attacked again. Our army adopted a three-sided encirclement formation and held out for three hours near Zhaoge Temple, eventually forcing them to retreat. In this battle, our Cui Brigade captured three machine guns, captured more than one hundred Mongolian bandits, and seized numerous horses. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegram: The entire pseudo-Tongliao police force of the rebel Zhang Haipeng, allied with Mongolian bandits, numbering approximately 5,000, launched a fierce attack on the flanks of Kailu from Xinbanoer League, north of Kailu, under the cover of Japanese aircraft. On the other side, the Japanese Itagi 6th Division and the Motegi Cavalry Brigade, from Maolin Temple and other places, with tanks and aircraft covering their infantry, cavalry, and artillery units, numbering approximately 6,000, launched a fierce frontal attack on Kailu. Our Cui Brigade and volunteer forces resisted valiantly, engaging in fierce battles four times. Due to strategic considerations, our army is holding the line near Fengsanjiazi, southwest of Kailu. (25th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Chengde telegram: The enemy forces that arrived in Tongliao included seventeen armored vehicles, eight cars, eight field guns, twelve mountain guns, twenty machine guns, twelve mortars, 6,500 infantry, seven aircraft, and seven detachments of Zhang Haipeng's forces, which released Kailu and demanded 300 shi of fried rice from the Chamber of Commerce, to be delivered within three days. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Cui Brigade stationed in Kailu telegraphed Tang last night, urgently reporting that the Japanese army's offensive was extremely fierce. After receiving the telegram, Tang dispatched a large force to reinforce. On the afternoon of the 24th, enemy forces on the Jinzhou-Chaoyang road, led by Xiyi, Zhengjia, Kato, and others, along with a large number of armored vehicles, tanks, and aircraft, again attacked our rear positions, engaging in a mixed battle with our Dong Brigade for three hours. In order to defend the Chaoyang positions, our army has concentrated in the Baiyaozi, Fenghuangshan, and Shuangmiao areas. Fierce fighting broke out in Baiyaozi and Shuangmiao on the morning of the 25th. (25th Special Dispatch) (Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed Ping, reporting that on the 20th, the Japanese army in Rehe seized 300 civilians and 800 carts to attack Lingnan from Mingshuitang and Ligoumen. Local militias rose up to resist, and he has urgently dispatched various units to reinforce. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegram: Tang received an urgent report from the front and decided to personally go to the front lines to supervise the troops within days. He telegraphed Meng Zhaotian last night, summoning him back to Rehe. Meng has already departed. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Tang Yulin telegraphed today, stating that according to an urgent telegram from Brigade Commander Dong on the 25th, the enemy forces on the northeast right flank of Chaoyang have been reinforced by three to four thousand, and the enemy forces on the left flank have been reinforced by two thousand, and have begun a general offensive on our defenses. The artillery fire is exceptionally fierce, and fighting is still raging at the time of the telegram. He has ordered the defending troops to hold their ground with all their might. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Fighting occurred in the Chaoyang and Kailu areas on the morning of the 25th. The enemy launched repeated attacks, but were repelled each time. There have been no changes in our positions. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) More than ten enemy aircraft bombed Chaoyang and Lingnan on the morning of the 25th. The enemy and rebels are advancing westward with a large army. The main battle will likely take place in three to five days. Chaoyang and Kailu are both under pressure simultaneously. Our army's morale is high. The enemy is focusing on Chaoyang and Lingnan, so the gains and losses of Beipiao and Nanling are no longer of great importance. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Miyake cavalry, numbering over a thousand, and the Suzuki infantry, numbering over fifteen hundred, carrying more than ten field guns and five mountain guns, pressed towards Lingnan along the Suiling Road on the 24th, engaging in fierce fighting with the volunteer army led by Peng Zhenguo. The enemy also dispatched three aircraft for cover. The situation in Lingnan is urgent. On the morning of the 25th, more than two thousand enemy troops at Jiukoukou also moved towards Lingnan with heavy artillery. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the 21st, the enemy in Tongliao, with over four thousand cavalry, infantry, and artillery, mixed with over three thousand puppet troops and Mongolian bandits, and more than ten aircraft, have launched multi-pronged attacks on our positions in Kailu, Daodeyingzi, and other places, engaging in fierce battles for days with our Cui Brigade and the volunteer forces led by Li Haiqing and Liu Zhendong. Our army is engaging the enemy in close combat with hand grenades and broadswords, inflicting heavy casualties on the enemy. The garrison in Chifeng telegraphed Tang repeatedly yesterday, warning of the situation. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A certain important person stated that the Japanese warlords, due to the failure of the League of Nations and diplomatic isolation, are bound to face major changes within their country. In order to alleviate the opposition at home, they are fiercely attacking Rehe, hoping to occupy it and demonstrate their achievements to the people. Therefore, they are fiercely attacking Kailu and Lingyuan. Even if our army in Kailu is not strong, the key to the overall military situation is not in Kailu. The major battles in the future will be in Chifeng and Lingyuan. We must endure, unite, and fight to the last battle. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chengde telegram: In recent days, the enemy army has sent reinforcements to the Rehe border, reaching forty to fifty thousand, in addition to approximately ten thousand puppet troops and Mongolian bandits, mostly heading towards Lingnan and Kailu, and launching fierce attacks on the Chaoyang line, seemingly feigning east to attack west. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Since the 20th, the enemy army in Kailu has repeatedly attacked our Cui Brigade with heavy artillery covering their infantry, cavalry, and Mongolian bandits, and with air force suppression. The fighting between the two sides has been extremely fierce. Since the 24th, no battle reports have been received from that line in Beiping. The fighting on the Chaoyang line was still intense yesterday and today. When our army recovered Beipiao on the 23rd, they disarmed all the puppet troops, capturing more than five hundred people and seizing a large amount of weapons and ammunition. The two sides are currently still locked in a stalemate at Nanling. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are very few foreigners inside and outside Rehe. There are only two Belgian missionaries in Chengde. There are no Americans or Japanese, and probably no British either. If there are any, they are merely observers and news reporters. According to He Zhuguo's report, the Japanese are currently fiercely attacking Lingyuan from the south. This morning, the Japanese army has ceased attacking Chaoyang. Six trains carrying Japanese soldiers and 5,000 [Manchu] soldiers arrived in Suizhong last night and are now rushing to the front lines to assist the Japanese army attacking in the Lingnan area. The temperature in several places in Rehe is currently twelve degrees below zero, causing machine guns to be unable to fire. (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Under arctic weather conditions and swirling winds, the Japanese and [Manchu] armies launched an attack on Rehe this morning. The Japanese army has been carefully preparing since early February and has taken preliminary military steps in the past few days. Details of today's fighting are still unknown.

<h3>Sudden Increase in Japanese Troops at Shanhaiguan</h3>
<p>The Situation at Shihe is Gradually Becoming Serious</p>
<h3>Japan Still Has Concerns Regarding Plans to Disrupt Luandong; The British are Paying Attention to the Kailuan-Beining Transportation</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Qinhuangdao telegram: Japan has suddenly increased its troops in Shanhaiguan, making the situation tense. It is reported that the British are paying close attention to this due to the Kailuan issue. Japan also recognizes that attacking Luanzhou and Luandong is the most dangerous path internationally, so it is still hesitating. It has now established a tight defense on the west bank of the Youhe River, waiting in full battle array, and dare not rashly attack our army. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japan is actively reinforcing its troops in Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan, seemingly threatening to invade Luandong and threaten Beiping and Tianjin. According to a military expert's observation, Japan has failed this time in the League of Nations, and is internationally isolated. The domestic financial community feels particularly uneasy. At this time, it is feared that it has no determination to cope with a second World War. Moreover, the international relations in Beiping and Tianjin are complex, and our country has a large number of troops stationed in Luandong. When the Japanese army is in danger here, it is feared that it has no courage to expand the Rehe war to Beiping and Tianjin. Therefore, the Japanese army's reinforcement of troops in the Jinzhou and Shanhaiguan area is entirely a show of force, hoping to restrain our Luandong military actions. In reality, the Japanese army's main force is currently most focused on the Kailu and Lingnan roads. The situation there has been extremely tense in recent days. In order to cope with the conspiracy, our army has not paid much attention to Beipiao and Nanling due to strategic considerations. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) British Minister Lampson received instructions from the British government, ordering him to pay attention to the transportation along the Beining Railway and the property of British merchants in the Kailuan mining area. After receiving the telegram, the British Minister, after consultation with American Minister Johnson and others, telegraphed the British and American embassies in Japan this morning, asking them to forward the message to the Japanese Foreign Ministry, requesting attention to the lives and property of British and American civilians and the Kailuan mining industry in North China, and requesting that Beining transportation not be cut off. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The commander of the Japanese garrison in Shanhaiguan received an order from the military headquarters to seize civilian laborers in the city and send them to Suizhong. Two trains carrying Japanese soldiers arrived in Shanhaiguan on the night of the 24th, carrying a large amount of military supplies and artillery shells. The number of Japanese warships in Huludao harbor has increased by five. Four ships are anchored in the waters off Shanhaiguan, and coastal defenses are very tight. An airfield has been built outside the east Luocheng of Shanhaiguan, with a communication aircraft parked there. Japanese troops are being moved around on the east bank of the Shihe River at night. (25th Special Dispatch) (Tianjin) There was a small contact at Jiukoukou and Shimenzhai on the morning of the 25th. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese army sent reinforcements to Shanhaiguan on the 25th, dispatching a certain lieutenant general to command military affairs. As a result, the situation at Shihe has become serious. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Current Affairs Commentary</h3>
<p>Forty-Two to One</p>
<p>(1) The Prestige of the League of Nations</p>
<p>Japan is barbaric. The puppet state is utterly ugly. Anyone who understands the details of the Sino-Japanese conflict cannot help but marvel at it as a historical farce. Uchiya Kōsai, the protagonist who instigated the September 18th Incident, has taken office as Minister of Foreign Affairs, transforming from a peaceful rubber [toy] to a steel puppet used by the military. His toughness and unreasonableness truly befit him as a loyal representative of Japanese militarism. He despises justice and tramples on the three northeastern provinces, believing that the world should be dominated by Japan alone. He is determined to kill all Chinese people to safeguard his so-called lifeline. Although our country has consistently made concessions, countries around the world have become greatly dissatisfied. The international situation has undergone a major transformation.</p>
<p>After the Nineteen-Nation Committee drafted its report, the Japanese imperialist plot to advance into Rehe, peer into Luandong, and disrupt North China became even more apparent. Our country has suffered deeply and can no longer tolerate it. Rising up to fight is inevitable. Striving to resist is the most justifiable action. The countries of Britain and France, for the sake of the League of Nations' prestige and the international balance, can no longer delay and allow Japan's iron heel to crush East Asia. Therefore, on the 24th of this month, the League of Nations General Assembly, after careful consideration of the rights and interests, fearing not Japan's threat to withdraw from the League of Nations, passed the report drafted by the Nineteen-Nation Committee by a vote of forty-two to one. No country openly supported Japan's claims, and no country recognized Japan's so-called "Royal Way." This General Assembly at least made countries around the world clearly recognize Japan's true face. At the same time, it declared that the Manchurian puppet state was indeed fabricated by the Japanese warlords and can no longer deceive the world with a peaceful facade. China is openly at war with Japan to resist the trampling of violence, and its momentum will be boosted by the moral support of the world.</p>
<p>(2) The Application of Article 16 of the Covenant</p>
<p>The reason why Japan discards everything and acts so recklessly is partly because it deceives itself into thinking that China is weak and unable to resist, and partly because it takes advantage of the conflict between Britain and the United States, and the discord between Britain and the Soviet Union, believing that no power will be able to restrain Japan. Thirdly, it deceives itself into thinking that the League of Nations is only a moral organization that relies solely on words and has no ability. Therefore, the resolution of thirteen votes to one on October 34th of the previous year was opposed solely by Japan, and not only was the resolution not established, but the H soldiers continued to occupy Liaoning and Jilin, and the situation expanded to Jilin, Heilongjiang, Jinzhou, and Yi County. Recently, it also occupied Shanhaiguan and flew to the Rehe border.</p>
<p>Although the League of Nations calls on the world for peace, the economic panic has yet to find a way out. Countries, for their own sake and for the sake of international balance, cannot use force. Japan's violation of the treaty and breach of faith are obvious. Now it has withdrawn from the League of Nations and is launching a large-scale attack on Rehe. The League of Nations has no weapons in its hands and is unable to stop the Japanese army's advance. How can it expect its proposals to be implemented? Even if the United States of North America and the Soviet Union both willingly participate in negotiations, it is feared that they may still not be able to restrain Japan's recklessness. But there is a way. Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant clearly stipulates:</p>
<p>[Should any Member of the League resort to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15]</p>
<p>then it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all [trade] or [financial] relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, etc. ]</p>
<p>[In such case the Council shall recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League.]</p>
<p>Whether this measure can be implemented is something that does not require a wise man to know. But the right and ability to implement it are not in the distant headquarters of the League of Nations in Western Europe, but in the Republic of China, which is suffering the most.</p>
<p>(3) Can Justice Triumph Over Power?</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, our country has been seeking [justice]. Now that justice has been obtained, the means to enforce this [justice] cannot be expected from the League of Nations. After Japan withdraws from the League of Nations, it will not be bound by the covenant, and it will no longer care about the League of Nations' decisions. It will rely solely on its army and navy to act recklessly everywhere. Just look at how that country's army is conscripting first-year soldiers onto the battlefield, and its navy is borrowing from large-scale exercises to demonstrate its power. Its desire to explode the Manchurian powder keg is obvious. Its consciousness of provoking war is also very clear. Some people compare us to Belgium at the beginning of the European war. But that is not true. Because our country has the support of [justice] and bears the responsibility of implementing this justice. In terms of our own interests, we should exert all our strength, use iron fists to drive out thieves, and use red blood to defend [justice].</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Northeast Incident, the Japanese imperialists used the excuse of preventing the Red Russians from moving south to win over England and incite France. They reaped the benefits and swept through the three provinces, preparing for war in every step. As for suppressing the national revolutionary movement, it was also one of the smoke bombs. After more than a year, the countries have realized Japan's cunning and realized that it is using this</p>
<h3>League of Nations Advisory Committee Discusses Banning Arms Exports to the Far East</h3>
<p>The British Government is Responsible for Contacting Relevant Countries</p>
<p>The United States and Russia are Actively Considering Participating in the Issue</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Advisory Committee, created by yesterday's League of Nations Assembly to monitor the China Dispute and assist the League of Nations Assembly in fulfilling its functions, held its opening ceremony at 11:00 AM this morning, which lasted for 35 minutes. It decided to instruct the Secretariat to send letters to the United States and Russia inviting them to participate in its work. After the recess, the Secretariat immediately issued the invitations in accordance with the instructions. The Advisory Committee also discussed the arms export ban. British representative Eden asked the members to consider this issue individually. Eden suggested that it would be best to form a subcommittee of countries with special relations to study it. Countries expressed sympathy for this proposal, promising to study the matter immediately so that it could be discussed together at the next meeting.</p>
<h3>The United States and Russia Participate in the Situation</h3>
<p>It is Widely Believed that the United States Will Accept the Invitation</p>
<p>The reply accepting the invitation to participate in the work of the Advisory Committee may be issued soon, and will not be delayed because the new president has not yet taken office. US representative Gilbert has been frequently appearing in the gallery of the League of Nations, and may be the US representative to the Advisory Committee. The reply from Russian Foreign Affairs Official Litvinov may be slightly delayed. Litvinov is currently in Geneva, but is scheduled to return to Moscow tomorrow in order to meet with key Soviet Russian figures to make a concrete decision on assisting the work of the League of Nations and joining the Advisory Committee, which will expand the twenty-one member committee into a twenty-three member committee.</p>
<p>Britain is Contacting to Ban Arms Exports</p>
<p>After the Advisory Committee adjourned, it issued a public statement, which stated, "The Advisory Committee established by yesterday's League of Nations Assembly met this morning, chaired by Hymans. It was decided to invite the United States and Russia to participate in its work in accordance with the resolution of the League of Nations Assembly. The Committee has learned that the British government has contacted other relevant governments regarding the export of arms to the Far East. The Committee asks the British government to inform it of the developments in this matter from time to time, as this matter is closely related to the work of the Committee. Chairman Hymans stated that he was chairing this meeting of the Advisory Committee in his capacity as chairman of the League of Nations Assembly. The Committee decided to temporarily postpone the chairman issue to the next meeting because Hymans expressed an opinion." (25th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Resolutions of the Assembly</h3>
<p>(Geneva) At 5 p.m. today, the League of Nations Assembly resumed its session. Chinese representative Gu Weijun spoke, requesting the League of Nations to help China overcome its current difficulties, stating that the League should immediately initiate sanctions as stipulated in the Covenant, and detailing the perilous situation in Rehe. He inquired how the League of Nations intended to deal with the imminent crisis in Rehe and then requested the League to authorize a special committee to enable unified action by member and non-member states to prevent the expansion of the war in the Far East, claiming that war was beginning in the Far East and that if countries could not unite and jointly uphold international security, there was a risk of being drawn into disaster. Mr. Gu attempted to refute the speech given by Japanese representative Matsuoka at the morning session, but he was dissuaded by Chairman Hymans, who requested that his remarks be limited to the resolution proposed by the Chairman to organize an advisory committee. Mr. Gu agreed but reserved the right to submit a written refutation of Matsuoka's statement later. Subsequently, the League of Nations Assembly passed the resolution and adjourned at 6:21 p.m. The Japanese representative did not attend, with only two Japanese secretaries from the League of Nations present as observers. The key points of the resolution were: (1) Based on Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, the League of Nations cannot ignore the development of the Sino-Japanese conflict. (2) The Secretary-General is instructed to distribute the report to member and non-member states, informing them that the League of Nations Assembly hopes they will take a unified stance. (3) To establish an advisory committee to monitor the situation and assist the League of Nations Assembly in fulfilling its responsibilities under Article 3, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, and to assist in the development of the conspiracy to monopolize the Chinese market. This is far more sinister than its so-called defense against "redification" and resistance to the Soviet Union. Moreover, since the establishment of the Franco-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact, the situation in Europe has greatly changed. The situation in East Asia is extremely urgent. This is why the League of Nations unanimously passed a resolution denying the legitimacy of "Manchukuo" and confirming that Japan's military actions exceeded the scope of self-defense.</p>
<p>However, Japan remains stubborn and acts recklessly, and cannot be persuaded by reason. Only by using force and providing a bloody lesson can we maintain human peace and ensure the safety of our national lives. And today, the only country in the world that can uphold the League of Nations Covenant and wield the iron fist to teach Japan a lesson is China. Who else?</p>
<p>Countries should adopt a unified attitude. (4) The Advisory Committee will include the members of the Committee of Nineteen, with the addition of the Netherlands and Canada, and will invite the United States and Russia to participate in the work. (5) The League of Nations Assembly will remain in session and may be convened by the President when necessary. (National News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Representative Gu Requests the League to Implement Sanctions</h3>
<p>Japan's Note Is Simply a Declaration of War</p>
<p>(Geneva) When the League of Nations Assembly continued its session tonight, Chairman Hymans presented a resolution and invited Chinese representative Gu Weijun to speak, but asked him not to touch on the remarks made by Japanese representative Matsuoka this morning. Therefore, Mr. Gu's remarks were limited to the situation in Rehe, describing the dangerous situation in Rehe, and requesting the Assembly to authorize the committee to take necessary steps before adjourning, so that the effective action of member and non-member states could be realized as soon as possible. Dr. Gu stated that the Chinese delegation was prepared to assist the committee's work in any possible way. The recent note from the Japanese delegation to the League of Nations has proven that Japan has absolutely no reason to carry out its ambitions in Rehe. Tang Yulin never declared Rehe independent, but Japan has raised questions about China's sovereignty over its own territory, which directly denies the right of a nation to exist and destroys the basic principles of international law. The Japanese announcement contains warnings; in fact, what right does Japan have to demand that China withdraw its troops defending its territory? "Manchukuo" is not only a puppet state, but also a mask for Japan's militarism. Judging from the conclusions of the Lytton Commission and the League of Nations Assembly report, the so-called Japan-Manchukuo Protocol is actually Japan's confession of guilt. We should focus all our efforts on resisting aggression. The Japanese spokesperson claimed that it was not necessary, and Japan's statement that it did not want to attack Beiping and Tianjin was Japan's way of foreshadowing its desire to obtain a second object. Yesterday's Japanese note was simply a declaration of war. The Assembly is also requested to pay attention to the system of joint sanctions against recalcitrant aggressor countries as stated in the Covenant. Is there still any doubt that Japan is illegally engaging in war? In the face of this grave situation, only by acting quickly in accordance with the Covenant and implementing sanctions can the world know that the League of Nations values fairness and earnestly fulfills its supreme mission. What is this mission? It is international peace. After Dr. Gu finished speaking, Chairman Hymans asked if anyone else wished to speak. No one responded, so the Chairman announced the end of the discussion. The Chairman also stated that if no one opposed the resolution he had proposed, it would be considered passed. With no dissent, the resolution was declared passed, and the Assembly adjourned. (Reuters telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Statement by the Chinese Embassy in London Regarding the Arms Embargo</h3>
<p>China and Japan Should Not Be Treated Equally</p>
<p>(London) The Chinese Embassy issued the following statement: [In the military actions in Rehe, the Chinese side is engaged in legitimate self-defense, while Japan is engaged in a war of aggression. Therefore, the ban on the transportation of military arms and weapons, if applied equally to China and Japan, is not only unfair to China, but also practically amounts to favoring Japan, since Japan is already fully armed, while China is not.] [Havas telegram, 25th]</p>
<h3>Future Work of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Significance of Representative Yan's Statement</p>
<p>(Nanjing) According to diplomatic sources, the League of Nations passed the report on the 24th, and we also voted in favor. However, Representative Yan stated that if Japan does not accept it, our country will not be affected at all. The meaning of Yan's statement is that in terms of obligations, if Japan does not fulfill the obligations of the proposed portion, we will not fulfill our obligations either. In terms of rights, if we accept the report, we will enjoy the stipulated rights, and other countries will not be allowed to declare war on us. Representative Gu raised the issue of Rehe at the Assembly, which was a preemptive move to leave room for invoking Article 16. The international community hopes that we will resist vigorously in Rehe. Now that the Assembly has passed the report, it will begin to implement the proposed portions one by one. The League of Nations will first establish an advisory committee, with the same tasks as the Special Committee of Nineteen, and will add Canada and the Netherlands, and invite the United States and Russia to strengthen its power. The Negotiation Committee will also be organized as soon as possible to report the results of the negotiations to the Assembly within three months. Therefore, the next three months are extremely important. Whether Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations is still uncertain, but it has no legal impact. The Advisory and Negotiation Committees can still carry out their work. (Central News Agency telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Observations of Our Diplomats</h3>
<p>Japan's Head-on Collision with the League of Nations</p>
<p>The Gains and Losses of Military Affairs Are of Great Importance</p>
<p>If We Can Resist for a Long Time, They Will Inevitably Fall into Chaos</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A key figure in diplomatic circles told reporters today that the spirit of the League of Nations' passage of the report is commendable, and its significance is also significant. Before the report was passed, the Sino-Japanese dispute could only be regarded as a dispute between two countries. After the report was passed, legally speaking, it has become a dispute between Japan and the League of Nations. In the next three months, the situation will become more serious, because Japan is extremely stubborn, and the League of Nations will exert its great power to bring Japan to justice. This is a major key to resolving the dispute. We are neither pessimistic nor disappointed, nor do we feel overjoyed. We only approach it with calmness. The situation in Rehe will expand due to Japan's stubbornness, and the gains and losses of military affairs are of great importance to diplomacy. We hope that the people and soldiers on the front lines will provide assistance in terms of spirit and materials. After the report was passed, Japan's diplomacy has fallen into a desperate situation, and its domestic economy is also in extreme panic. Stock prices have fallen by 900 million in a week. The military controls politics, and the cabinet is in a precarious state. If we can resist for a long time, they will inevitably fall into chaos. The most noteworthy thing is that Japan's aggressive militarism still does not dare to bear the responsibility for starting the war, and it is using all kinds of vicious schemes to shift the blame to us in order to resolve its domestic instability. We hope that the people will pay attention to this. (Central News Agency telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Various Small Countries Support Our Withdrawal of the Envoy to Japan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, a telegram from Geneva relayed that our delegation suggested to the government to withdraw the envoy to Japan. According to reliable sources, the telegram has arrived in Beijing. The content is that the representatives of various small countries support our withdrawal of the envoy to Japan. Our delegation reported this to the government based on this telegram, and it was not a suggestion from the delegation. The diplomatic authorities seem to have considered this, but they refuse to express any opinion before a decision is made. (Central News Agency telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Only Confidant</h3>
<p>The World Is Big, But Only Siam Understands</p>
<p>Japanese Warlords Are Overwhelmed with Gratitude</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of the Army of Japan heard that the Siamese representative abstained from voting at the League of Nations Assembly. The Army believes that Siam is its only confidant in the world. Today, it specially dispatched Colonel Honma, the head of the Army Press Corps, to visit the Siamese Embassy in Tokyo to express gratitude. It is reported that the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has also telegraphed Secretary-General Sawada to thank the Siamese representative in Geneva. (China United Press telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>U.S.-Japan War</h3>
<p>The New York Times Believes It Is Impossible</p>
<p>Samoa Island Remains Under Military Control</p>
<p>(Washington) A Washington correspondent of the New York Times discussed the development of the Far East, saying that he had not met a responsible person who believed that there was a possibility of war between the United States and Japan, even in the distant future. (Reuters telegram, 25th) (Washington) Samoa Island in the South Pacific of the United States has always been under the administration of the Navy Department. The islanders requested to change to a civilian government. After Congress sent personnel to investigate in 1930, the Senate has passed a bill allowing the island to be governed by civilians. Today, it was suddenly rejected in the House of Representatives by a vote of 72 to 26. Although the island is in the Southwest Pacific, far from the islands under Japanese mandate, it is an important coal depot for the Navy. It occupies a strategic position militarily. With the situation in the Pacific becoming increasingly urgent, the U.S. Congress still wants to keep it under military control. (National News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>

<h3>League of Nations Report</h3>
<p>U.S. Government Expresses Satisfaction</p>
<p>New Secretary of State Firmly States Support for Treaties</p>
<p>Hull Consults with Stimson on League of Nations Response</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. government officials, while pleased with the League of Nations Assembly's adoption of the report drafted by the Committee of Nineteen, do not wish to make a public statement expressing their opinions, so as not to improperly increase the reaction of the public in various parts of the Far East. However, it is also being made known that these officials believe that the actions of the League of Nations are tantamount to realizing the United States' advocacy of maintaining treaties and not recognizing land acquired by force, and that it is also clear evidence that world opinion is solidified and supports the principles declared by the United States long ago. However, U.S. government officials feel that the situation is too serious, so they cannot hope that the United States will formally declare its reaction to the actions of the League of Nations early, and that since the change of government is less than two weeks away, any formal comment will have to wait for the new president. This is another reason why the U.S. government is not immediately expressing its opinion on the report. Although, U.S. official circles now expect the League of Nations to formally notify them of its report, at which time the United States will need to respond. It is expected that the U.S. government will express its satisfaction in the reply, because the League of Nations resolution is the same as the U.S. position. If this reply is issued before the change of government on March 4, it will be drafted by the future Secretary of State Hull in consultation with the State Council. It is reported that Hull will meet with Stimson for several hours tomorrow, and the discussion will focus on the entire diplomatic situation, with particular emphasis on the diplomacy of the Far East. Hull has always remained silent on the Manchurian issue, but Democratic leaders believe that he will adhere to the traditional U.S. policy. Furthermore, key Democratic figures say that the U.S. government will wait until the new government takes office before making a formal comment, and that this does not mean that there has been any change in policy, but rather that it is respecting the spirit of the new amendment to the Constitution, which stipulates that the change of the President and Cabinet will be changed from March 4 to early January. (National News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Mr. Hull, who was appointed Secretary of State by Roosevelt a few days ago, explained the future policy of the new U.S. government today. Hull told guests that the United States should pay attention to the words and spirit of any other country's compliance with treaties and international contracts, without allowing any slack. At the same time, there must also be sound and practical international cooperation to help maintain world peace, while not forgetting the habits of the United States and the Constitution of the United States. The success of the new government's foreign policy will depend on the extent to which the United States helps restore world commerce and maintain world peace. (Reuters telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Japan Hesitates on the Issue of Withdrawing from the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Emergency Cabinet Meeting Ends Without Result</p>
<p>Uchida Again Visits the Emperor</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Before the extraordinary cabinet meeting opened at 2:30 p.m. today, Foreign Minister Uchida entered the palace to visit the Emperor, reporting on the proceedings of yesterday's League of Nations Assembly. He left after about half an hour.</p>
<p>(Tokyo) An emergency cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's residence at 4 p.m. today. After Foreign Minister Uchida reported on the League of Nations proceedings, he introduced the situation of various countries toward Japan. Army Minister Araki continued to report on the situation in Rehe. However, regarding the withdrawal from the League of Nations, it was originally scheduled to be decided at today's cabinet meeting, and the procedure for consulting the Privy Council would be taken immediately. Because the official report from the delegation has not yet arrived, only the situation was reported today. After the official report arrives, it will be decided at the extraordinary cabinet meeting on the 27th. (Electric News telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, the Assembly passed a proposed resolution, and the attitude of the League of Nations has reached its final decision. The Japanese government convened an emergency cabinet meeting today to formally decide on the withdrawal policy, and immediately issued a major instruction to the delegation to withdraw. However, the procedures for the abrogation of the Treaty of Versailles require consultation with the Privy Council. After the cabinet meeting, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Bureau of Legislation began to prepare everything. (Electric News Agency telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) With the League of Nations Assembly coming to an end, the Japanese delegation has decided to withdraw from Geneva. Representative Matsuoka is scheduled to leave Geneva for Paris at 2:30 p.m. on the 25th. Representative Nagaoka is scheduled to leave for Paris at 9:40 p.m. on the same day. Representative Sato is scheduled to leave for Brussels on the 28th. (Electric News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to official claims from the Japanese side, Japan will at least temporarily not withdraw its representatives from the Disarmament Conference. Even if the Japanese government is forced to withdraw from the League of Nations, it will continue to cooperate with other major powers so that the disarmament plan can be resolved. (National News Agency telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations has not yet been able to fully believe that Japan will actually withdraw from the League of Nations. It is said that Japan may take the attitude of an outsider, ignoring all League of Nations resolutions, and only send an observer to participate informally, as the United States does, when meetings are held. (National News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<h3>Matsuoka Goes to the Netherlands</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Japanese representative Matsuoka is now going to the Netherlands to initiate negotiations for a Japan-Netherlands non-aggression treaty, which of course refers to the Dutch East Indies. (Reuters telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Sources in The Hague, who are well-informed,</h3>
<p>are greatly surprised by the news from Geneva that Japan intends to negotiate and conclude a non-aggression treaty with the Dutch government, including the Dutch East Indies. According to semi-official sources, the authorities are completely unaware of this, and political circles have not received any news that Matsuoka intends to come here to handle this matter. (National News Agency telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>A Glimpse of Public Opinion in Various Countries</h3>
<p>Banning the Supply of Arms and Money to Japan</p>
<p>The Theory of Taking International Action Is Gaining Strength</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times said that the League of Nations' unanimous resolution against Japan's actions is extremely important. Even if Japan leaves the League of Nations, it will eventually not escape the condemnation of conscience. Whether Japan is in or out of the League, this morally important judgment will eventually make Japan uneasy. The New York World-Telegram said that the League of Nations has been established for fourteen years, and it is only now that it has a clear position. The future of the League of Nations depends on the future of the Far Eastern issue. If moral condemnation and non-recognition are still ineffective, then peace-loving people will inevitably find another way to solve this difficult problem. (Reuters telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Manchester Guardian said in today's society column that the League of Nations Assembly's passage of the report of the Special Committee of Nineteen is a victory over itself, not a victory over Japan. However, it will have to defeat Japan in the future. Any country that accepts the League of Nations' verdict cannot sell arms to Japan, otherwise it will be an accomplice to the barbaric war that violates the treaty. (Reuters telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times published an editorial today, saying that there are various reasons why it is extremely desirable for Japan to maintain its cooperation with the Disarmament Conference. A major power like Japan would never deign to completely refuse to participate in the good work that the League of Nations has painstakingly managed simply because its opinion on a dispute differs from that of the League of Nations. The newspaper continued, saying that Matsuoka's statement that "we are willing to assist China" need not be doubted. It is by no means impossible for Japan to temporarily apply a better administration to Manchuria. Then, the result of its current actions may allow parts of North China to enjoy security and peace. Japan claims that it is now engaged in the work of civilization, and its words are not unreasonable, but its breach of promise and its denial of treaties and various obligations under the League of Nations Covenant are undeniable. Since the methods of the Japanese warlords cannot be compatible with the principles of the League of Nations, the League of Nations has no other way but to refute such methods. Although the League of Nations' position cannot force the implementation of the agreed solution, the member states are responsible for doing their best to achieve the final victory. Their clear responsibility today is not to assist in any way countries that seek to impose their own solutions by force. The Times concluded that, in the months before the dispute, at least export licenses should not be issued for any arms and ammunition shipped to Japan. (Reuters telegram, 25th) (London) Today, all the London morning newspapers used Japan and the League of Nations as the main material for their commentaries. The News Chronicle said that countries should immediately implement international action to ban the supply of arms and money to Japan. The definition of "contraband" by the British Admiralty during World War I can be reinstated. The Daily Express said that any resolution on matters of great importance to Great Britain and the Empire should be issued in London, not in Geneva. The Daily Mirror said urgently that we should be careful to look far ahead, refuse to go to war, and not hold the empty hope of stopping the war others are brewing. The Daily Mail said that from today onwards, the League of Nations or any member state of the League of Nations cannot claim to be completely neutral in honor or responsibility. China should at least receive the spiritual assistance of any country that upholds the League of Nations Covenant. (Reuters telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today, French newspapers thoroughly discussed the dramatic posture of the Japanese representative's work in Geneva yesterday, and what important impact it will have on the League of Nations. The newspapers believe that the Eastern island nation will now withdraw from the League of Nations. The left-wing newspapers still resent Japan, saying that the League of Nations has exhausted its ability to prevent Japan from expanding its imperialism in the war in Rehe. The right-wing newspapers said that Japan has tolled the funeral bell for the League of Nations. The League of Nations can do nothing more than organize a committee to send personnel to monitor developments. It is a big mistake for the League of Nations to exclude Japan. (Reuters telegram, 25th) (Paris) French political circles are paying close attention to the severity of the situation in Geneva and Rehe. The government is closely monitoring current events. It is reported that it is opposed to any form of sanctions against Japan. The Times reported that the real Sino-Japanese war has only just begun, and the only hope is for China and Japan to find a solution before the war extends into North China. The Debats reported that if the Japanese army invades the Chinese mainland, it is feared that there will be a very serious dispute, which will lead to foreign intervention. The Paris Evening Post exclusively urged the League of Nations to implement economic sanctions. The Liberté believes that the League of Nations has intentionally or unintentionally succumbed to the influence of the United States, isolating Japan. (Reuters telegram, 25th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troops in Tianjin Create a Terrifying Situation</h3>
<p>Installing Iron Fences, Laying Electric Nets, Stacking Sandbags</p>
<p>Armed Japanese Soldiers Guarding at the Border</p>

In an emergency, electricity will be turned on to replace the electric nets. On the morning of the 25th, Japanese soldiers installed electric nets and stacked sandbags in the area from the Wall River to the Haiguang Temple Japanese barracks. The electric nets are taller and stronger than those during the Tianjin Incident the year before last. (Special telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The commander of the Japanese troops stationed in Tianjin, Nakamura, held a secret meeting on the evening of the 14th, deciding that whether or not there will be military action in Tianjin will depend on the Rehe military situation.

<p>(Tianjin) Japanese women and children in Tianjin are unwilling to return to their country and are willing to serve the Japanese army, which has been understood by Nakamura. They are now in charge of sewing hemp bags, making electric nets, and stacking sandbags. On the 25th, Japanese women also worked to install iron fences at the Sino-Japanese crossings. Another group of Japanese women were sent to various hospitals to practice nursing and first aid. From 6 p.m. on the evening of the 25th, fully armed Japanese soldiers were stationed at the Sino-Japanese crossings, facing our police posts from a distance. The Japanese consulate, the Japanese police station, and the Japanese barracks are all stocked with sandbags, laid with electric nets, and heavily guarded. (Special telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese Consul-General in Tianjin sent a note to the provincial government on the 25th, requesting that it effectively protect the safety of the lives and property of Japanese residents in Tianjin and the province. (Special telegram, 25th)</p>

<h3>Constitutional Drafting Committee Decides on the Elements of a Nation</h3>
<h3>Appointment of Research Committee Members for Each Group</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Constitutional Draft Committee has tentatively made the following decisions regarding the research on the elements of the state: 1. Territory: Enumeration of provinces and regions; 2. Form of Government: The Republic of China is a Republic based on the Three Principles of the People; 3. Sovereignty: Belongs to the citizens of the Republic of China; 4. Flag Color: Remains the same (i.e., Blue Sky, White Sun, and a Red Earth). These will be submitted to the constitutional draft on March 2nd. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Legislative Yuan has appointed members to the Constitutional Draft Committee to conduct group research. Group 1: Territory, Form of Government, Sovereignty, Flag Color Committee: Wu Jingxiong and six others, convener Zhang Zhiben. Group 2: Rights and Obligations of the People, People's Livelihood Committee: Ma Yinchu and ten others, convener Wu Jingxiong. Group 3: National Diplomacy, Exercise of Four Powers, Committee on Equal Distribution of Power between the Central and Local Governments: Jiao Yitang and ten others, convener Zhang Zhiben. Group 4: Central Government System, Provincial System, County System Committee: Ding Chaowu and ten others, convener Chuan Bingchang. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhang Zhiben, Deputy Chairman of the Constitution Drafting Committee, said: Regarding the territorial issue in the draft constitution, I believe that enumeration is advisable. Because our country is surrounded by powerful nations, border negotiations are sometimes unavoidable. If the territory is not defined by enumeration, it will easily provoke the expansionist ambitions of the other party. This is clearly demonstrated by the various fabrications that the violent Japanese made to the League of Nations when they invaded and occupied the Northeast. Looking at the territorial provisions in the constitutions of modern Austria and Mexico, their intentions are exactly the same. The drafting of a written constitution does not shy away from being detailed. The so-called enumeration is to list the names of each province, as well as Mongolia, Tibet, and various special regions, clearly indicating the scope of the territory, in order to prevent the covetousness of powerful neighbors. Colleagues all agree with this opinion and will draft according to this principle in the future. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Tea Party Held by Members of the Central North China Office</h3>
<h3>Distribution of Work and Preparation for Departure, Wang Faqin Talks About Feng Yuxiang's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Members of the Central North China Office held a tea party at the Central Party Headquarters at 8 p.m. Those present included Director Zhang Ji, Wang Faqin, Chen Lifu, Zhao Pilian, Zhang Lisheng, Huang Musong, Wang Luyi, Liu Shouzhong, Bai Yunti, Ke Xinge, Chuan Rulin, Ji Liang, Miao Peicheng, etc. Zhang Ji chaired the meeting. The discussion focused on the departure points of each committee member to the front and the distribution of work for each person. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 p.m. It is reported that among all the committee members, except for Ding Weifen, who has already gone to Xinxiang to prepare, the remaining committee members will depart north within two days. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Faqin said: The national crisis is so serious that Feng Yuxiang will definitely be asked to take on difficult tasks and serve the country. When Huang Shaogu arrived in Nanjing, Chairman Chiang sent a telegram instructing him to consult with He Yingqin and Zhu Peide nearby. The result of the consultation between Huang, He, and Zhu was that He and Zhu strongly hoped that Huang could go to Jiangxi to meet with Chiang to obtain a concrete decision on Feng's position. Huang has not yet sent a telegram since going to Jiangxi, but it is expected that he will reply soon and that Feng will be able to come to Nanjing for a visit in the near future, before heading north to the front line. All members of the Central North China Office decided to hold a discussion meeting on the evening of the 25th and depart north in the next few days. The temporary expenses are 30,000 yuan, and more will be added if it is not enough. The committee members will go to various places to handle party, government, and military affairs. Except for particularly important matters that need to be reported to the central government at any time, the rest will be executed immediately and reported afterwards. The rules of procedure have also been discussed and decided, and each committee member can handle matters according to the standards. If time permits, I may go north to meet with Feng and then go to the front. To save the country, we must resist Japan and defend against foreign invasion. The principle has been unanimously recognized. However, with the Japanese army so rampant in attacking Rehe, our country must defend Rehe with all our might and must not give up. Moreover, the whole country must have the greatest spirit of sacrifice and resolutely resist Japan. At the very least, we must resist as we did during the Shanghai War. Even if we are forced to retreat, we must still resist. If we win, we will recover the lost territory, and even if we lose, we will have glory. As far as the current situation is concerned, military pay is more important than military equipment. I hope that the people of the country can contribute as much as possible. As for the rumor that I will be appointed as the Vice President of the Legislative Yuan, not only has it not been decided, but even if it is decided, I will not do it. (Special dispatch, 25th)</p>

The temperature gradually increased on February 19th and 20th, reaching 17.3 degrees Celsius on the 21st, which was the highest temperature since the beginning of spring.

<h3>One Wave Subsides, Another Rises: American Financial Turmoil</h3>
<p>Two Hundred and Five Banks in Maryland Suspend Operations</p>
<p>(Reuters, Baltimore, 24th) Today, the Governor of Maryland, Ritchie, ordered all banks within the state to temporarily close until next Wednesday to avoid losses to both banks and depositors after a run on deposits. Currently, a total of 205 banks have suspended operations throughout the state. Over the past week, depositors have been withdrawing funds. Apart from ordinary commercial transactions and ordinary payments, withdrawals throughout the state have exceeded 13 million yuan. This morning, for some unknown reason, there was a large-scale run on banks. Two of them will be unable to open tomorrow. The governor urgently summoned a meeting of the state's six major banks and then issued an order for all of them to suspend operations, shocking the nation. However, according to the governor, all banks in the state have a solid foundation, and only a few cannot cope with the sudden run. Currently, the state legislature is considering a bill to limit the amount of withdrawals that depositors can make without prior notice. Now that a financial crisis has occurred, both houses will quickly pass this bill, and it is expected that the governor will sign it into law on Tuesday.</p>

<h3>Hitler's Dictatorship</h3>
<p>National Socialist Stormtroopers Obtain Police Powers Berlin Dispatch from the 24th: German Chancellor Hitler, in terms of maintaining order, can now practically be called a dictator. This is because the government has granted police powers to the National Socialist Stormtroopers under his command. Meanwhile, Goering, the administrative commissioner in charge of Prussian police affairs, also stated that the Prussian police will fully cooperate with the National Socialist Stormtroopers to maintain local order. Furthermore, strong and sturdy individuals will be selected from the Stormtroopers and the Steel Helmet organization to form police auxiliary teams, wearing special armbands and led by formal police officers. Their main task is to protect election campaigns and public utilities and buildings when disturbances occur during meetings. As for the reason why the government granted police powers to the Stormtroopers, it is said that the current police force is too weak to cope with the increasing number of emergencies and violations of the law, as well as the attacks by the Communist Party. Berlin Dispatch from the 24th: With the date of the German parliamentary re-election approaching, all the people in the country are eager to know the only big question: if this re-election still fails to secure a majority of the pro-government faction in the new parliament, what changes will occur in the situation afterwards? The leaders of the pro-government faction seem to have a clear plan for this question and have revealed it slightly in previous election campaign speeches. Among the most important ones, Chancellor Hitler has clearly stated that March 5th is the only opportunity for the German people to voluntarily entrust the future of the country to the current government. However, if the German people do not release this right path, the current government cannot allow the country to be taken over by the parties that will destroy the nation, and take themselves to destruction. This view is the same as that of Steel Helmet leader and Minister of National Defense Seld. It is said that the life of the current government will definitely not be limited to March 5th, but will be extended for several years until it can successfully guide the people of the whole country and obtain their approval. As for the opposition's arguments, they are still trying their best to oppose the government with a small majority and say that the current government will definitely not have the opportunity to obtain a majority in the next parliament.</p>
<h3>League of Nations Handles Colombian-Peruvian Dispute</h3>
<p>Unusual Negotiation Conditions</p>

This committee, representing the Executive Council, notified the Peruvian government of the basic conditions for beneficial negotiations to resolve the dispute between Peru and Colombia. The conditions are as follows: (1) The negotiations should be based on the recognition of Colombia's sovereignty in Leticia; (2) Leticia should be an international city, administered by the Colombian government under the commission of the International League. Colombia seems to have accepted the internationalization of Leticia, but the Peruvian government is trying to revise the Salomón-Lozano Treaty, because according to that treaty, the disputed area is to be governed by Colombia.</p>

<p>Public Telegram</p>
<h3>Telegram from Rehe to All Newspapers and Compatriots Nationwide:</h3>
<p>Since the Mukden Incident, the three northeastern provinces have fallen, and the ambition of the violent Japanese is expanding. On New Year's Day this year, they occupied our Yuguan again, like a wild boar and a long snake, determined to swallow our entire country and destroy our nation. All those with blood and spirit are heartbroken. Rehe is suffering, and Ning is at the forefront of the invasion. The region is in hardship, suffering from the attacks of a strong enemy, supporting and struggling for over a war. The violent Japanese have recently increased the mobilization of wooden troops to launch a general attack on us. The situation is critical. If Rehe has any mistakes, Tianjin and Beijing will be threatened immediately, not only will North China be shaken, but even affect the whole country. It is true that if North China is weakened, the teeth will feel cold. Fortunately, our Chairman Tang's determination to resist Japan has been thoroughly implemented, and the soldiers at the front are bravely taking the lead. The Japanese pirates' ambition has not been achieved. However, Rehe is barren and the people are poor, ranking first among the provinces. Financial resources are exhausted. The local people usually do not even have time for ordinary wishes, and now they are in even greater hardship. The counties along the border have been repeatedly bombed by enemy planes. Corpses are everywhere, houses have collapsed, and the tragic situation is indescribable. In addition, a large army has gathered, reaching more than 200,000. Local production is limited, and military and civilian food is feared to be in short supply. Households have no savings, and rooms are empty. If methods are not devised early, the old and weak will be displaced and die in ditches, and the young and strong will take risks and go to the enemy for food. The violent Japanese boast of the locust policy, and we are no different from fish in a pond, causing great harm. This is why we urgently request to quickly find ways to provide relief. In short, Rehe is China's territory, and the people are China's nation. Since Rehe must be defended, the local people should be rescued by finding a way to survive. This association is responsible for leading the people, and sincerely appeals on behalf of four million people in the province. It is not a mere formality of writing, but the urgent task of the current situation. We earnestly hope that the central government will continuously provide funds and ammunition for the army, and find ways to maintain the local people. We also hope that all provinces will rise up at the same time, unanimously advocate, enthusiastically transport supplies, and donate according to their ability, and awaken the attention of compatriots. Only by accumulating small contributions can we achieve salvation, and make everyone have the heart to destroy their homes to relieve the difficulties, and each have the meaning of seeing righteousness and acting bravely. Then, huge sums of money will not be difficult to reach immediately. Give priority to buying grain, and spring plowing will arrive in a blink of an eye. Provide relief to the people's food, and rush to relieve the disaster, and help the local people's depression. The army and the people unite and help each other. The army acts as the vanguard of killing the enemy, and uses its life to compete for the first. The people are the backing of the army, and they must not leave to die. Make another effort and fight to the death. At present, the defense is consolidated, and Rehe has not lost an inch of land. In the future, when the army launches a general attack, the three provinces will be defeated in one fell swoop, driving out the Japanese pirates and returning our country. The country is fortunate, and the nation is fortunate. Urgent words, respectfully await your guidance. The Rehe Provincial Party Department kowtows in response,</p>
<h3>Overview of the Japanese Attack on Rehe</h3>
<p>It is a gift from heaven, a virgin land,</p>
<p>And we must not allow it to be seized by the Japanese.</p>
<p>But the Japanese shout to raise the axe of reclamation,</p>
<p>The sooner the better, to hack into Rehe.</p>
<p>Since the fall of Shanhaiguan, the Rehe issue has become a stimulant for Japanese warlords to take another step on the foothold of militarism. At the same time, it has also become a touchstone for our country's authorities to "resist humiliation with strength and resist for a long time." In order to make the people of the country understand the truth about the Rehe issue, the following is a brief description of the general situation of Rehe.</p>
<h3>Territory</h3>
<p>Rehe includes the Zhaowuda League and Zhuosotu League in eastern Inner Mongolia, and the Mulan Paddock, which was a hunting ground for the emperor during the Qing Dynasty. The provincial boundary stretches from 40 degrees to 46 degrees north latitude and from 116 degrees to 122 degrees east longitude, with a total area of approximately 580,000 square miles. It is backed by the Greater Khingan Mountains, which meander from northeast to southwest. To the west is the Yinshan Mountains, which run from the Helan Mountains around the north side of the Hetao area, across the provinces of Suiyuan and Chahar to Baicha Mountain. The northeastern branch is the dividing line between Rehe and Chahar, and the southern branch winds through Rehe, forming the Qilaotu Mountains and the Nuluerhuling Mountains. There are also the Songling Mountains, which run parallel to the Bohai coast and serve as a barrier to the southeastern border of Rehe. The northeast borders Liaoning Province, stretching thousands of miles and forming a very large plain. The northern part is undulating hills, the southeast is a plain, and the central and southern parts have rivers and high mountains intertwined. The rivers include the Luan River, the Daling River, and the Xiaoling River.</p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p>Rehe was originally part of Inner Mongolia. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, Shandong and Zhili (now Hebei) provinces were overcrowded, and the people had no way to make a living, so they moved here in droves. The residents of Rehe counties today are mostly descendants of people who moved from Shandong and Zhili provinces. Their clothing, food, housing, and daily habits are no different from those of residents within the customs. However, there are still a small number of Mongolians living on the wastelands in the western and northeastern parts, living a nomadic life of following the water and grass. Rehe has a population of about four or five million, almost entirely Han Chinese. Mongolians and Manchus account for only a very small number.</p>
<h3>Climate</h3>
<p>The climate of Rehe is quite inconsistent due to the complexity of the mountains and rivers in the territory. Generally, because it is farther away from the ocean, it has the characteristics of a continental climate. In terms of climate, each year can be divided into four seasons. Spring lasts about one month (from early May to early June), summer lasts about two months (from mid-June to early August), autumn lasts about one month (from early August to early September), and the remaining seven or eight months are all winter. The hottest month of the year is July, with a maximum temperature of 60 degrees Celsius, and the coldest month is January, with a minimum temperature dropping to minus 30 degrees Celsius. However, because the climate is continental, the rainfall is extremely low. The number of rainy days throughout the year is only about 20 days, and the rainfall is also very unevenly distributed. The months with the most rainfall in a year are between June and August, but most of them are showers and light rain, lasting only a few hours at a minimum and no more than one or two days at most. Because there are very few trees, the rivers are very prone to flooding. Traffic is often blocked after each rainfall. There is also very little snow, only about four or five times a year. If the climate changes drastically, it often snows in May, and the rivers begin to freeze in October, not melting until early April of the following year. However, due to the different climates in the north and south, the period of freezing and thawing is also slightly different. The north is windy throughout the year, especially in spring and winter. The wind is quite strong. From May to September, the winds are mostly southerly, or southeasterly and southwesterly. From October onwards, the wind is severe, piercing the skin, and is northwesterly.</p>
<h3>Products</h3>
<p>Rehe is endowed with rich natural resources,</p>
<p>Extremely rich, which is coveted by the Japanese. The following is a general description of its products:</p>
<p>Rice: Approximately 45,000 stones</p>
<p>Wheat: Approximately 400,000 stones</p>
<p>Sorghum: Approximately 1,500,000 stones</p>
<p>Wool: Approximately 2,000,000 stones</p>
<p>As for minerals, coal is produced in Xinqiu, Daninggou, Yuejiagou, Xiyuanbaoshan, Shidafen, Wujia, Songshutai, and other places. In addition, wool, licorice, and other various medicinal materials are also special products of Rehe, and the annual output is also quite considerable.</p>
<p>In summary, it can be seen that Rehe is indeed a divinely blessed country, a virgin land. Whether from a political or economic point of view, Rehe must not be seized by the Japanese. Currently, the Japanese are all frantically shouting [Hurry up and raise the axe of reclamation, the sooner the better, to hack into Rehe], and the total mobilization for aggression against us has also begun. Then, what should we do? I hope all the people of the country will think about it.</p>
<h3>The Communist Suppression in Jiangxi Province Is About to Launch a General Attack</h3>
<h3>The Joint Suppression by the Armies of Four Provinces Is Complete; Party and Government Personnel and the Masses Are Mobilized</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: After Chairman Chiang arrived in Jiangxi, he actively deployed the Communist suppression campaign. He considered both military, political, and party affairs, and also made thorough arrangements on the borders of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, Zhejiang, Hunan, and Hubei provinces. It is reported that the date of the general attack is not far away. The following is a record of important news about the Communist suppression:</p>
<h3>Military Affairs</h3>
<p>In the past two large-scale encirclement and suppression campaigns, the military aspect focused solely on Jiangxi, where the Red Army was located. The regions bordering Jiangxi, though nominally involved in the joint suppression, were in fact watching each other from across the border, allowing Zhu De and Mao Zedong to calmly flee to Guangdong and Fujian, nurturing the wound and causing harm, leading to today's mobilization of two or three hundred thousand troops, wasting the anti-Japanese forces. Therefore, before this suppression campaign, Chiang, in addition to sending Huang Shaohong to Guangdong to request that Guangdong and Guangxi send troops to Jiangxi to assist in the suppression, also transferred a certain unit from Zhejiang to Jiangxi, to cooperate with the Guangdong army. At the same time, he ordered the various divisions in western Fujian and the armies on the Fu River in eastern Jiangxi to attack from both sides, so that the Zhu Mao forces in the border areas of Jiangxi, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang could be surrounded on all sides, making it impossible for them to escape. Only in this way can their main force be identified, so as to avoid the situation where the bandits come when the troops leave, and the bandits leave when the troops come. As for the joint suppression by the armies of the four provinces, in addition to gradually taking a defensive posture, the other three provinces all took an offensive posture. (A) Jiangxi is the center of the Communist suppression, with a military force of more than 200,000, of which at least more than 100,000 are assigned to eastern Jiangxi. Chiang has appointed Chen Cheng, the commander of the Fu River front, as the commander-in-chief of the Central Route Army, with three columns under his command. It is said that Chen Cheng, the commander of the 18th Army, Luo Zhuoying, the commander of the 5th Army, and Wu Qiwu, the commander of the 4th Army, will be appointed as the commanders of the first, second, and third columns, respectively. The armies and divisions in eastern Jiangxi all belong to it and are generally controlled by Chen Cheng. They will advance towards the border in three routes, and will recover Jinxi, Zixi, Lichuan, and Guangchang in the shortest possible time, and then join forces with the Guangdong and Fujian armies to attack Ruijin and Ningdu. Chen assumed the position of commander-in-chief of the Central Route on the 12th in the province, and the commanders of each column also reported to the capital to take office. Chen has been discussing military plans with Chiang in the province for days, mobilizing border troops, and distributing forces. As soon as everything is ready, he will rush to the front to issue a general attack order. (B) The northeastern border of Guangdong is intertwined with the borders of Jiangxi and Fujian. It is reported that Chen Jitang sent Yang Dezhao as a representative to Jiangxi to meet Chiang and discuss the issue of Guangdong and Guangxi sending troops. Yang stayed in the province for a week, and a proper plan has been discussed in military terms. Chiang also agreed to provide financial assistance. Yang took the satisfactory contact and left for Xun on the night of the 14th with Li Shangyong, the representative of the 8th Route Army stationed in Jiangxi, and then returned to Guangdong via Shanghai to report to Chen. Recently, the headquarters has received telegrams from Chen Jitang and Li Zongren, expressing their agreement with the military plan brought back by Yang. Chiang also appointed Yu Hanmou as the commander-in-chief of the Left Route Army, leading the Guangdong and Guangxi armies from Ganzhou, Anyuan, and Huichang to Xingguo and Yudu, with the goal of attacking Ruijin, where the false central government is located. (C) On the Fujian side, Chiang appointed Cai Tingkai as the commander-in-chief of the Left Route Army on the 14th, and all units in Fujian were under his control. Cai telegraphed Chiang on the 16th, saying that he had taken office in Fuzhou, and immediately ordered all of them to mobilize and advance towards the Jiangxi border.</p>
<h3>Party and Government</h3>
<p>Chiang considered Communist suppression as treating the symptoms with military force and treating the root cause with party and government affairs. Regarding the aftermath of the bandit areas, the post-disaster committee jointly formed by the military, government, and party was in charge. Chiang also appointed Chen Cheng as the chairman of the committee, with two offices under his command: party affairs and government affairs. Gong Boxun, a member of the provincial government, served as the director of the government affairs office, and Li Zhongxiang, a member of the provincial reorganization committee, served as the director of the party affairs office. They were ordered by the chairman to handle all party and government affairs in the recovered areas, handle the aftermath, and were no different from a battlefield government affairs meeting. Gong Boxun reported to take office on the 17th, organized road construction teams, captured bandit receiving teams, etc., to build roads with the army and take charge of military transportation. In the bandit-occupied counties, Ningdu, Ruijin, Shicheng, Guangchang, Yudu, Huichang, Anyuan, Xunwu, and Lichuan were set up as eight post-disaster groups in order to clean up the remnants, handle rescue and healing, restore order, and recruit refugees when they were captured.</p>
<h3>Masses</h3>
<p>All sectors of the province unanimously participated in the Communist suppression. Therefore, after Chiang's visit to Jiangxi, a mass assistance committee for Communist suppression was established in Nanchang, with branches set up in all counties that had not been captured by the bandits and in all villages and towns near the bandit areas. According to the committee's plan: (1) Organize an economic committee to raise funds to help the army and provide disaster relief. (2) Organize a 15,000-member iron shoulder team to take charge of military transportation. (3) All vocational groups will set up a coordination association to lead their members to do their best in manpower and financial resources to carry out the general mobilization of the Communist suppression work. (4) Make widespread publicity and movement, and strictly implement frugality this year, unite and rise up to help complete the Communist suppression work. The remaining items are all in progress.</p>
<h3>Bandit Situation</h3>
<p>The Red Army in this province originally had Zhu, Mao, Peng, Fang, Shao, Kong Hechong, Li Tianzhu, and other factions. Fang and Shao have already fled from northeastern Jiangxi to southern Xinjiang in eastern Jiangxi and joined forces with Zhu and Mao. Only a part of the remnant bandits are still in the old Guangxin territory north of Xinjiang, including Hengtiao, Yiyang, Wannian, Guixi, and Yujiang. They are now being jointly suppressed by the divisions stationed in Zhejiang, Anhui, and northeastern Jiangxi. Kong Hechong's pseudo-16th Army, except for the 9th Division that fled back to southern Hubei, the pseudo-7th and 8th Divisions, the pseudo-Independent 1st, 2nd, and 3rd Divisions, and the pseudo-Red Police Division, are still scattered in the border area of the three provinces of Xiushui, Ganggu, and Wanzai. They are now being jointly suppressed by the divisions under the command of Zhu Shaoliang. Li Tianzhu's pseudo-8th Army was formed by gathering scattered bandits from western Jiangxi and the Hunan border. Yongxin and Ninggang were used as bases, and they emerged in the areas of Wan'an, Taihe, Suichuan, Lianhua, Anfu, Chongyi, and Shangyou. It is reported that the Hunan army has actually entered Jiangxi and joined forces with the Guangdong army in Chongyou and the certain divisions in Suichuan and Taihe. As for Zhu, Mao, Peng, and others, they are not only the leaders of the bandits, but also the leaders of the largest Red Army in the country. Their pseudo-central government is located in Ruijin, and only a small number of pseudo-student soldiers, guards divisions, and replenishment divisions are stationed there. Their main force is following Zhu and Mao to commit crimes in the border areas of Fujian and Jiangxi. Their pseudo-1st, 3rd, and 5th Army Groups, the pseudo-22nd Army, six pseudo-Independent Divisions, and Fang Shao's pseudo-10th Army, totaling about 40,000 to 50,000 people with 20,000 to 30,000 guns, are entrenched from the Guangdong border in the south, through northwestern Fujian, southeastern Jiangxi, to the border between western Zhejiang and eastern Jiangxi. The main force of this group originally fled to the Zhejiang border, but recently suddenly moved south, concentrating its main force in Lichuan and Zixi. On the one hand, the pseudo-3rd and 5th Army Groups besieged Nanfeng, and on the other hand, the pseudo-1st Army Group fled back to Jinxi from Zixi, and at the same time, the pseudo-4th and 5th Independent Divisions attacked Yihuang, attempting to make a final gamble, but they were all defeated by various armies. Once the general attack of the four provinces' armies is launched, it should not be difficult to completely wipe them out.</p>
<h3>The Rampancy of Local Bandits in Northern Hubei</h3>
<p>The bandits have a total of nine divisions, with a crowd of ten thousand people. The counties of Suizao have been robbed severely. The Luo Brigade is advancing to suppress the bandits in Henan territory. Hankou Correspondence: Since the major groups of Red Army bandits in Hubei Province gradually died out, the survivors in the bandit areas seemed to have hope for recuperation, but the local bandits in various places have not been eliminated, so their power has gradually increased. For example, a large group of local bandits was recently discovered in Sanhe Village, which belongs to Suixian County in northern Hubei, totaling about four or five thousand people, formed by the union of various groups from Henan, Hubei, and Shaanxi. The bandits call the bandit groups "divisions," and the bandit leaders are called "division leaders." For example, the group formed by the Zhang family is called the Zhang Division, and the group formed by the Yang family is called the Yang Division. They used to harass the counties of Sui, Zao, and Zhongxiang. The bandits include the Zhang, Yang, Gu, Ma, Mao, and Liu Divisions, and Zhang and Yang actually hold the key to the whole group, like the alliance leader among the chieftains, because their followers are more numerous and their weapons are more sophisticated. The Zhang bandit's name is Ruiwu, and the Yang bandit's name is unknown. They are rebel soldiers from a certain unit in Shaanxi Province. The banner reads the First Security Regiment. Zhang and Yang both claim to be regimental commanders, with more than two thousand people, complete equipment, and mortars and machine guns. The bandits mostly speak with a Henan and Shaanxi accent. After entering Hubei territory, the leaders of the Gu Desheng, Liu Xinghan, Chen Hanqing, and Mao Xing family's divisions successively joined them. The Gu, Liu, Chen, and Mao Divisions are local bandits in Zao Yang, who disturb the border of Sui Zhong. The number of people varies and the guns and bullets are not very complete. The bandits without guns are replaced by sticks to serve as "guides" and "ticket takers," because they are natives. As for the Ma Regiment, it fled from Yichang Jingmen, with no less than a thousand followers. On New Year's Eve, it fled to Sanhe Village and occupied it as its lair. The two divisions of Ze Tao Yu and Kang Cai Wu, who were originally stationed there, also joined forces, and their power became even greater. Pan's office has been defending the area for many years, and Kang used to be the head of the regiment of Fan Zhongxiu's department. It is incomprehensible that they are willing to join the bandits.</p>
<p>After Zhang and Yang's bandits entered Sui and Zao, every village and town they passed was looted. No less than a thousand people were kidnapped. For example, when the bandits first fled from Suiyang Inn, they fell into Zishan. All four hundred households in the city were looted. A Mr. Sun was brutally killed on the spot. It was in the middle of the night, and the residents were all asleep. The bandits kidnapped everyone, regardless of the poor or the rich, about five hundred people in total. After the bandit leaders interrogated them one by one, if a family was completely kidnapped, one person would be released to raise money to redeem the ticket. Those who were truly impoverished were released. In addition to those who were released, a total of more than two hundred and seventy people were kidnapped. Zishan originally belonged to the eastern second district of Zao. After the bandits robbed it, they went to the Liusong area in the southern third and fifth districts to harass. Then, they fell into the Fule River, which belongs to Zhongxiang, and robbed more than a thousand men and women. Then, they entrenched themselves in the Matou Village and Niutou Village north of the town, waiting for the ticket redemption. When the Ma Division came to meet from Jingyi, they turned north and fled to Bawan Mountain, Liangtan Pan, Shiyan Village, and Majia Village, where they searched and robbed extensively. Finally, they concentrated in Sanhe Village and sent their partisans to burn and kill in all directions. The victims are probably tens of thousands of families.</p>
<h3>Feng's Faction Sends Xu Qian Southward</h3>
<h3>Representatives from Guizhou, Yunnan, and Hunan also Arrive in Guangzhou One After Another</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: Recently, representatives from various parties have been arriving in Guangzhou in a continuous stream. The most notable of these is Xu Qian, representing Feng Yuxiang. It is said that Xu has already arrived in Hong Kong, keeping his movements extremely secret. While in Hong Kong, he met with Hu Hanmin and Li Jishen. Xu's mission is approximately to report on the situation of Feng's old subordinates and to connect with the Southwest. Xu also mentioned that most of Feng Yuxiang's old subordinates are eager to serve the country, but they are facing economic difficulties. If the Southwest could provide assistance, they could rise up and become the vanguard against foreign aggression.</p>
<p>The Southwest Political Affairs Council has recently been focusing on uniting the various provinces in the Southwest. Previously, it dispatched Mai Huanzhang to Guiyang to coordinate everything. Now that the situation in Guizhou has stabilized somewhat, Mai has been further dispatched from Guizhou to Sichuan to contact a certain general in Sichuan. As for Wang Jialie of Guizhou Province, he recently sent Lu Shou to Guangzhou as his plenipotentiary representative and also sent Zhang Yunliang to Guangzhou to organize the Guizhou Army's office in Guangzhou. Wang also sent a telegram to Guangzhou yesterday, reporting that the Guizhou Army's Wu Jianping led the remnants of his troops to retreat to Xingren and requested reorganization. In order to clear the western routes and facilitate trade between Yunnan and Guizhou, Wang has ordered Commander Bai Huizhang to lead his troops across the river. Commander Bai's troops entered Xingren on the 13th, and the two battalions of Wu's troops, Zhou and Song, collapsed. Commander Bai dispatched teams to disarm and reorganize them. It is said that the western defense of Guizhou Province will be completed and stabilized within days. It is rumored that after the defeat of Mao Guangxiang, You Guocai, and others in Guizhou, they either went to Sichuan to request assistance or went to Beijing to ask for instructions. Therefore, the Southwest urgently dispatched Mai Huanzhang from Guizhou to Sichuan to discuss countermeasures with a certain Sichuan army general. Bai Chongxi of Guangxi Province also rushed back to Guangxi from Guangzhou in order to coordinate with Wang of Guizhou. Therefore, the war in Guizhou is not only an internal dispute but also an undercurrent of struggle between two major forces behind it. Regarding Yunnan's attitude, it previously sent representatives Dan Maoxin and Zhang Chong to Guangzhou. Zhang Chong soon left Guangzhou for Shanghai, but Dan remained in the province. According to Dan, this time he was ordered by Long (Yun) of Yunnan to discuss important political matters with the Guangxi authorities because there are many issues to be resolved due to the relationship between neighboring provinces. Therefore, he first went to Guangxi and then came to Guangzhou. It is premature to say that Yunnan has joined the Southwest National Defense Council. According to a message from the Political Affairs Council yesterday, after Dan arrived in Guangzhou and met with various officials, he telegraphed Long Yun on the 18th, reporting the results of the negotiations. Whether Yunnan will join the Southwest National Defense Council or not is still awaiting Long's reply.</p>
<p>He Jian of Hunan Province also sent representative Ling Zhang to the province on the 15th of this month to meet with military, political, and party leaders here. It is said that they are discussing issues such as suppressing the communists and resisting Japan. The Southwest Political Affairs Council also intends to send someone to Hunan in return.

<h3>Guangzhou Authorities Secretly Reject Li</h3>
<h3>Chen Hanyu's Murder is Related to the Rejection of Li; Li Jishen Sends Letters to Various Generals to Clarify Rumors</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: The military authorities in Guangdong Province recently suddenly executed Chen Hanyu, the former chief of staff of the Fourth Army Group. It is rumored that this is related to the rejection of Li Jishen's return to Guangdong. On the 12th of this month, Chen was residing in Dongshan when he was suddenly arrested by military police. On the 13th, he was sent to the military law office of the First Army Group Headquarters for interrogation. On the afternoon of the 13th, a team was sent to escort Chen to Honghuagang for execution. The headquarters also posted a notice near the execution ground, stating that retired soldier Chen Hanyu had been appearing in Guangzhou, plotting wrongdoing. After interrogation, he was found guilty and sentenced to death. Chen was originally the commander of the Fifth Army Corps. In 1924, he served in an important position in the General Headquarters and was appreciated by Sun Yat-sen. In 1931, when the new National Government was established in Guangzhou, a staff group was organized. At that time, Li Jishen's confidant Feng Zhuwan served as the director of the staff group, and Feng appointed Chen Hanyu as the deputy director of the staff group. It seems that Chen was close to Li Jishen. However, the Guangdong authorities have a very poor relationship with Li Jishen. When Li first went south to Hong Kong, the Guangdong authorities blocked him. Before long, Li's confidant Feng Zhuwan lost his position as director of the Department of Finance because of this matter. When Li recently went south to Hong Kong for the second time, the Guangdong authorities were on guard again, and it is not known how. There was suddenly a rumor that Li would be appointed chairman of the Southwest National Defense Council. The Guangdong authorities formally denied this and further tightened their guard against Li's activities. Chen Hanyu was arrested and executed at this time, so it is suspected that it is related to the prevention of Li. After Chen's death, the government's anti-Li propaganda became more intense, saying that Li had not made a clear handover when he left office in Guangdong and had recently sent a letter to Chen Bonan (Jitang), requesting funds for activities. Therefore, Li immediately sent a long letter to the generals in Guangdong from Hong Kong, stating that "Since I took office in the Fourth Army until the Eighth Route Army, one term replaced another. Brother Bonan took over the Fourth Army, and brother Bonan also happened to take over the Eighth Route Army, which your brothers can all remember. However, both times the handover was done by Ma Binghong and received by Chen Yinglin. The handover was clear on that day. Otherwise, brothers Ma and Chen are still in Guangzhou. How difficult is it to verify? The Northeast has been lost for nearly two decades. Anyone with a conscience is indignant. Therefore, I temporarily followed someone's request and introduced Zhang Juchi to appeal for monthly funding to achieve his great cause. Brother Bonan said that Guangdong's finances are public and he cannot make the decision, and it must be submitted to the Political Affairs Council for approval. Although it was later rejected, even though the gentlemen did not receive the benefit, I still admire Bonan's open attitude. How can it be said that I asked Bonan for activity funds? I hope you will clarify this and dispel the doubts of the people." From this, it can be seen that there is still much estrangement between Guangdong and Li. Moreover, Li, while in Hong Kong, did not agree to go north despite Huang Shaohong's persuasion but stated that he would return to Guangxi for a trip during the day. (February 14th)</p>
<h3>Tibetan Monk's Discussion on Tibetan Affairs</h3>
<h3>More Detailed than What Dharma Master Neng Hai Said; Also Said That the Dalai Has Changed His Attitude Towards the British</h3>
<p>Chongqing Dispatch: According to the monk Manduoshi Guolingman, who recently returned to Chongqing from Tibet, the recent situation in Tibet is even more detailed than what Dharma Master Neng Hai, who previously returned to Sichuan from Tibet, said. I am specially recording it below to inform the citizens who are concerned about the situation in Tibet.</p>
<h3>Politics</h3>
<p>In recent years, all military and civilian affairs in Tibet have been controlled by the Dalai Lama alone. Initially, the Dalai Lama felt that his own power was weak, so he was extremely pro-British, using British imperialism as his backing to consolidate his own position. Recently, his own power has become strong, and the entire Tibet is in his hands alone. Therefore, he is no longer as flattering to the British as before. He extremely opposes any unfavorable actions by the British towards Tibet. Therefore, the current Dalai Lama is not as pro-British as the Dalai Lama of the past.</p>
<h3>Economy</h3>
<p>The economy of the entire Tibet has been exhausted due to the repeated impact of wars in recent years on the government and the people. The Sichuan-Kang-Tibet war consumed as much as 3 million rupees of the people's wealth. Last May, when the Tibetan army was defeated, the Dalai Lama purchased more than 500,000 yuan worth of military equipment from Britain. Merchants and civilians are sitting and waiting for death due to excessive taxation. Taking Lhasa (the Tibetan capital) as an example, 50 stores have closed down within a month due to the impact of the economy. To purchase goods outside of Tibet, one must exchange them for rupees in India. In the past, four Tibetan silver dollars could be exchanged for one rupee, but now 30 Tibetan silver dollars can only be exchanged for one rupee. In order to collect cash, the Dalai Lama minted copper coins and issued paper money, forcing the people to use them. Now, the assets of the Tibetan people are only copper and paper.</p>
<h3>Military</h3>
<p>The Tibetan army now only has infantry, cavalry, and artillery. Most of the infantry is drawn from the people and receives very little training. Among them, there are more than 5,000 people who have been trained by the British, Russian, and Japanese, and they are considered the most elite. They are currently stationed in Longbuling and Ka Garden. The military equipment is bought from India and is what India has discarded. Recently, a batch of new-style rifles, machine guns, and mountain guns were purchased from Britain. The uniforms worn by the Tibetan army are all contracted by the British, and their style and color are exactly the same as those of the British soldiers. The flags used by the army have a lion on them, and the colors are red, yellow, blue, white, and black. There are currently about 100,000 soldiers in the army. The soldiers' ages range from 16 to 60. Officers receive 900 liang of barbarian silver per year, in addition to land granted by the Dalai Lama. If they die in battle, the land is inherited by their descendants. In addition to receiving four liang of silver per month, soldiers are also granted some land by the Dalai Lama.</p>
<h3>Society</h3>
<p>Due to the cold weather in Tibet, there are very few products, and the people's lives are extremely poor. The main foods are nothing more than barley, wheat, and highland barley. The upper class occasionally eats rice, mostly purchased from India. Even the oil and salt for daily use are all transported from India.</p>
<h3>People</h3>
<p>The Tibetan people can be divided into three parts. One part supports the Panchen Lama, one part supports the Dalai Lama, and the other part is the Red and Yellow sects. The people who support the Panchen Lama often hope that the Panchen Lama will return to Tibet and get rid of the Dalai Lama's harsh rule, but the Panchen Lama has difficulty returning to Tibet because his power is not as strong.

<h3>Achievements of the Shandong Construction Department's Machinery Factory</h3>
<h3>Long-Distance Telephone and Bucket Dredger</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: The long-distance telephone manufactured by the Shandong Construction Department's Transportation and Water Conservancy Machinery Manufacturing Factory previously had a limited communication distance of only over a hundred li due to the use of excessively thick wire for various wire packages. Last winter, another 100 magneto telephones with four magnetos were manufactured, and the magnetos were replaced with tungsten steel. Various wire packages were replaced with No. 43 coated wire, and other parts were also improved. It is now said that 30 units have been installed and tested in many ways. The power of all the rocking generators, earphones, and electric bells is above 110,000 ohms. In addition to the cost of materials, only labor costs are charged, and each unit is priced at 60 yuan, which is about half the price of imported products. It can be said that the price is low and the quality is good. The factory has sent a letter to Shen, the technician of the Electrical Group of the Construction Department, and Hu, the director of the Long-Distance Telephone Management Office, asking them to come to the site for inspection and also asking them to send letters to the construction agencies and long-distance telephone branch offices in various counties, asking them to purchase them separately. The leakage of Shandong's long-distance telephones can be recovered from now on. In addition, the Jinan dredger manufactured by the factory is scheduled to be launched for dredging in the Shili Gate area of the upper reaches of the Xiaoqing River as early as tomorrow (24th). In addition, there are two mud-carrying boats, each of which can hold five cubic meters of mud. During operation, the mud is dredged by the dredger into the boat, and the boat transports it back and forth. When launching the project, Song Wentian, the director of the Xiaoqing River Engineering Bureau, and Zhong Boren, the director of the Machinery Factory, will all be on site to supervise the work.

<h3>Disaster Relief in the Communist Bandit Areas of Western Anhui</h3>
<h3>The剿匪 Headquarters Allocated 30,000 Yuan</h3>

Recently, the provincial government has re-established a disaster relief association in the bandit areas to actively raise funds. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has allocated 30,000 yuan to handle disaster relief in western Anhui. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government chairman Wu Zhongxin immediately ordered the Secretariat to deliberate on the disaster situation and make overall arrangements.

<p>Local News</p>
<h3>Director-General of the Aviation Association, Wu Tiecheng, Hosted Various Teams Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reported on Solicitation Methods to Encourage the Teams to Proceed</p>
<p>Wang Xiaolai, Dai Ji, and Others All Gave Passionate Speeches</p>
<p>The China Aviation Association, at 4:30 p.m. yesterday, the solicitation director-general Wu Tiecheng, hosted a tea party for the various team leaders at the YMCA in Baxianqiao. Over two hundred people attended, including Shi Liangcai, Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Wang Xiaolai, Lin Kanghou, Du Yuesheng, Chu Huiseng, Qian Xinzhi, Dai Ji, Yu Hongjun, Wen Hongen, Wu Xingya, Pan Gongzhan, and Wang Yunwu. The meeting adjourned at 5:40 p.m. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<h3>Chairman's Speech</h3>
<p>The chairman of the Shanghai Solicitation General Team, Wu Tiecheng, said in his speech, "The aviation-rescue-the-nation movement has become increasingly enthusiastic over the past year. Since the establishment of the Aviation Association and the holding of the Aviation-Rescue-the-Nation Propaganda Week, branches have spread to various cities, and the importance of aviation has also been recognized by the people of the whole country. It has now moved from the propaganda period to the implementation period. The greatest purpose of the aviation movement is to unite the wisdom and financial resources of the 400 million people to build an air force and consolidate national defense. Today, the national crisis is deepening. We are here to repent and give speeches. I don't know how tragic the situation is for the people in the combat zones of the three northeastern provinces and Rehe. We will do our best to engage in the most effective national salvation movement, and justice will not allow us to refuse. As the saying goes, 'When impermanence arrives, all things come to an end.' Since the invention of the air force, humans can encounter danger at any time. Its destructive power is greater than that of the army and navy. The strategy and method are very different from the past. It started with swords and guns and evolved into artillery, and now it has evolved from a plane to a three-dimensional one. In the past, the dangers of war were limited to the front line, but now danger is felt everywhere. Although it seems too late to engage in the aviation movement today, we cannot sit idly by and wait for death, and we have to take action quickly. However, this matter is of great importance and cannot be done by the ability of a few people. Therefore, I ask you to take the position of team leader, and I hope that you and the citizens of the city will push it to the whole country, work together with one heart, and assist the Aviation Association. Then the Aviation Association can assist the government to build a strong air force." Next, Zhu Shaoping, the director of the solicitation department, explained the solicitation methods.</p>
<h3>Summary of Speeches</h3>
<p>(1) Wang Xiaolai said in his speech, "When the people of the country are in danger, they 'always hope for the protection in the air'. In the past, this was superstition, but now it has been seen in fact. When war breaks out, one cannot but hope for protection in the air. The aviation solicitation is also a touchstone of the patriotism of the people." (2) Garrison Commander Dai Ji said in his speech, "I hope that the people of the country should catch up quickly and not just talk about it so that they can see the success as soon as possible." (3) Xu Baoying said, "Aviation thoughts have existed in our country since ancient times. Sun Tzu said, 'Those who are good at fighting move above the nine heavens, and those who are good at defense hide below the nine earths.' The former refers to airplanes, and the latter refers to submarines. Fortunately, the people of the country do not forget their ancestors." (4) Chu Huiseng said, "Assisting the anti-Japanese army and building aviation should be carried out at the same time. Although the establishment of the air force will take at least eight months or a year, the war will certainly not be over in a year. It is not too late to plan for it now. Japan already has more than 70 airplanes donated by the people, but China does not have one. We should catch up quickly." (4) Xie Wugang said, "The people of the country have always been good at writing empty articles and doing little practice. The greatness of Mr. Sun Yat-sen lies in the word 'do'. Mayor Wu can inherit the Prime Minister's ambition and do things practically, which is really admirable. He also cited the Qing Dynasty's use of the funds for building the navy to build the Summer Palace for Empress Dowager Cixi, which led to the decline of the country's power, which can be called a lesson from the past."</p>
<h3>Steps to Proceed</h3>
<p>(10,000 Yuan Per Team) Each solicitation team should solicit at least 5,000 members or membership fees of more than 10,000 yuan. If the team leader can handle the solicitation independently, it is best. Otherwise, the team leader must invite several colleagues, fellow professionals, colleagues, or family members, relatives, and friends to be team members. Each person is responsible for soliciting a number of members and membership fees, which is determined by the team leader. In this way, solicitation is extremely easy to popularize and is also easy to succeed. (Report in Stages) Once the team members are selected, the team leader should urge the team members to work hard every day. It is hoped that each team member will solicit at least ten members or membership fees of more than 20 yuan per day. Five days after the solicitation, the results will be reported to the team leader once. The team leader will collect the solicitation results of the team members and report them to the general team leader. However, each time there must be more than 1,600 yuan in membership fees or more than 800 members. The reporting dates are divided into six times: the first time is March 15th, the second time is March 25th, the third time is April 5th, the fourth time is April 15th, the fifth time is April 25th, and the sixth time is April 30th. Before reporting the results each time, the membership fees must be paid to the designated bank for collection and the receipt must be obtained as proof of the report. (Efforts to Achieve Universality) The team leader and team members must work hard at any time and in any place and must report the solicitation results on time and do their best to persuade compatriots to join enthusiastically so that people from all walks of life, whether farmers, businessmen, students, men, women, old or young, can participate and spread it throughout the city and the country.</p>
<h3>Method of Solicitation</h3>
<p>The chairman then introduced Zhu Shaoping to report the methods for forming a solicitation team. (For families,) when members are recruited, in addition to collecting membership fees and issuing receipts, family members, neighbors, relatives, and friends, regardless of gender, age, or occupation, should all be encouraged to join. If relatives and friends are already members, they should be asked to introduce other relatives and friends to join, and so on, with introductions made through mutual referrals. (For schools,) regarding students, in addition to asking the principal and all faculty and staff to join, all students must also be encouraged to join, and students should introduce their relatives and friends to join, and so on, with introductions made through mutual referrals. If students in schools are economically well-off, the school will be responsible for their membership fees, which will be paid by the students upon joining. If students are economically disadvantaged, the school should be responsible for paying their membership fees on their behalf, in one lump sum.

<p>Jinghu, Huhangyong Railway, at this year's [January 28th] commemorative meeting held by the Party branches of the two railways, unanimously passed a resolution for all employees of the two railways to donate to purchase a Jinghu, Huhangyong aircraft. The resolution was submitted to the Executive Committee of the Party branches of the two railways, which decided to establish the Jinghu, Huhangyong Railway Air Defense Fund-raising Committee, with 11 members. Four members were from the Party branch, including Executive Committee members Chen Chengshi, Li Dasan, Zou Zhengjian, and Supervisory Committee member Chen Fuhai; four members were deputy directors from various departments of the railway, Yuan Boyang, Yuan Shaochang, He Yongyuan, and Zhong Guidan; and three members were from the labor union, council members Min Luobi, Chen Bohua, and Feng Qishu. The first meeting was held yesterday afternoon at the Party branches of the two railways, where the regulations were adopted, and Yuan Boyang, Chen Chengshi, and Li Dasan were elected as standing committee members; He Yongyuan, Chen Fuhai, and Zou Zhengjian were elected as donation custody committee members; Min Luobi and Chen Bohua were elected as directors of the general affairs group; Feng Qishu and Min Luobi were elected as directors of the propaganda group; Zhong Guidan and Chen Fuhai were elected as directors of the design group; and Yuan Shaochang and Zou Zhengjian were elected as directors of the fund-raising group.

It was also resolved that, in addition to the monthly donations for purchasing aircraft stipulated by the central government, another 150,000 yuan would be raised and completed in a short period of time. If necessary, it was also planned to find a way to borrow in advance from the employees of the two railways. The employees were exceptionally enthusiastic about this initiative, and the prospects for fundraising were also very promising.</p>
<h3>Tianchu Aircraft</h3>
<p>Guomin News Agency reports that Wu Yun Chu and Zhang Yi Yun, factory directors of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory, yesterday specially brought a letter to the China Aviation Association, willing to donate 110,000 yuan to purchase the [Tianchu Aircraft]. Secretary-General Lin Wojang of the association received them and expressed a warm welcome. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully, national salvation through aviation has been recognized nationwide as the only path to national salvation. Propaganda has been underway for some time, but fundraising has yet to achieve results. With the enemy deeply entrenched, how can we afford to delay? Our factory recognizes its limited strength, and now we are contributing all our resources, donating all of the factory's operating profits for the 21st year of the Republic, totaling 90,000 yuan, to purchase a fighter aircraft, to be named National Salvation Tianchu Aircraft. The remaining 20,000 yuan will be covered by Yi Yun and Yun Chu, to do our part as ordinary citizens. We dare not claim to be leading the way for the world. We believe that there will be no shortage of generous gentlemen in the world who will come to our aid, just as adding firewood to a fire, later arrivals will surpass those who came before. We eagerly await this. Addressed to the Aviation Association, from Zhang Yi Yun and Wu Yun Chu of Tianchu Monosodium Glutamate Factory."</p>
<h3>Hugong Aircraft</h3>
<p>The General Labor Union has organized a fund-raising committee to raise funds for the Hugong Aircraft and is actively carrying out the work. Draft simplified fund-raising rules and a letter to workers have been distributed to various labor unions. Yesterday, all the staff of Jia Fuji Accounting Office of Pudong China Wharf contributed their spring wine money for this year, totaling 200 yuan, and submitted it to the union, designating 100 yuan to donate to the Hugong Aircraft and 100 yuan to be used to comfort the soldiers at the front. The union was deeply impressed by the workers' patriotic enthusiasm and hopes that workers throughout the city will follow suit.</p>
<h3>Huining Aircraft</h3>
<p>Xu Jiashi, former Criminal Division Chief of the Shanghai First Special District Local Court, yesterday sent a letter to the Huining Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, advocating raising funds to purchase a Huining Aircraft. The original letter states: "I believe that today our country cannot be saved without war, and during wartime, the army cannot fight the enemy without the assistance of the air force. The bitter battles in Songhu, Jilin, and Heilongjiang, which could not be sustained, serve as a lesson. The government usually does not prepare, and although it is now deducting salaries from civil servants to purchase aircraft, the amount is small and insufficient. The Japanese people, I hear, have formed groups and purchased aircraft to help their country. They are the aggressors, yet they are so eager to do so. How can our people remain indifferent and sit idly by as we perish? I believe that our fellow villagers from Huizhou have always been united. With the country in such dire straits, it is time for us Huizhou people to rise up and save the country. I propose that you send separate letters to the fellow villagers from the six counties in Shanghai and to the fellow villagers in other ports, urging them to donate funds to purchase an aircraft, to be named Huining Aircraft. If the amount of funds raised is large, purchase a fighter aircraft; if it is small, purchase a reconnaissance aircraft, and send it to General Weng Zhaoyuan of the Aviation Association to promote this initiative. At this time when the whole country is united in hatred against the enemy, I believe that this fund will not be difficult to raise. Once our Huizhou people take the lead, other provinces and fellow villagers associations will follow suit. Our Huizhou people purchasing one aircraft for the country is equivalent to purchasing hundreds or thousands of aircraft for the country. The benefit to the air force equipment is not small. This is our duty to save the country. I sincerely hope that you will follow my humble opinion and quickly convene a temporary general meeting to discuss and decide on a plan of action. In addition to deducting my salary and remitting it to the central government, I will also donate another 100 yuan to follow the fellow villagers. (Fellow villagers in Yichun will be asked to donate after the donation booklet is received.) Looking east at the clouds, I bow nine times to ask. How about it? Please reply." It is heard that the association has scheduled a special meeting for today (i.e., the 26th) to discuss the implementation plan.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Aircraft</h3>
<p>Since the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association launched the fund-raising committee to purchase the Ningbo Aircraft, people from Ningbo have been generously donating. Wang Shuntai Silk and Woolen Shop on Nanjing Road in this city voluntarily donated 500 yuan, and the colleagues of the shop also voluntarily donated 150 yuan. Cai Lianqing donated 2 yuan, and the Minhua Dyeing and Weaving Factory donated 5 yuan. Dong Zhikang and Zhang Youfa, colleagues of the factory, each donated 2 yuan. Zhang Caixiang, Yang Damao, Wang Xiaoshun, Dai Renzhong, Chen Mingzhang, Zhang Yifa, Zhu Shunfa, and Tang Quanshun each donated 1 yuan. Qian Yunhai donated 20 cents, Shao Yuxian donated 60 cents, Sheng Defang donated 40 cents, and Liu Shunlin donated 30 cents. Ding Delin, Kang Yifa, Wang Changlin, Chen Jialin, Chen Aquan, Gong Hui, 3</p>
<p>Xiang, Ge Peisheng, Wang Yongfu, Tang Yidou, Xue Bingyi, Sun Cairong, Cao Yunqing, Zhang Shigui, Wang Baoyuan, Zheng Changlin, Song Dehua, and Zhang Ziming each donated 20 cents. Zhu Yingkui, Ying Wenjun, and Lang Baoxun jointly donated 6 yuan. Mingji donated 1 yuan, and Jiang Junqing donated 5 yuan. The letter from Wang Shuntai Shop is recorded as follows: "To the Ningbo Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, the Aviation Salvation Fund-raising Committee, Having read in the newspaper yesterday that you have a goal of 200,000 yuan and adhere to the principle of not soliciting donations, we believe that there are many who are enthusiastic and patriotic and voluntarily donate, but the amount is always small. It would be better to try to solicit donations from more reputable and substantial fellow villagers. The result of such fundraising would certainly surpass not soliciting donations. In short, the more fundraising, the better. If you can raise millions or tens of millions, wouldn't that be even better? Why limit yourself to only 200,000? Please consider whether this is appropriate. Our shop and colleagues are all descendants of Yan and Huang, and we dare not fall behind in the effort to save the country. We are now donating 650 yuan, knowing that it is a drop in the bucket, but we are doing our duty. We hope that you will uphold the spirit of perseverance and work hard to save the country. (The rest omitted)"</p>
<h3>Xiong Xiling Discusses the Recent Situation in North China</h3>
<p>Urgently Awaiting Assistance from Shanghai Residents</p>
<p>Acting Premier Song Ziwen recently launched the Northeast and Rehe Support Association in Beiping, appointing Zhu Qinglan and Xiong Xiling as standing directors, and actively preparing for the implementation of measures, aiming to provide strong military support. It is learned that Xiong Xiling is in charge of the relief group. He arrived in Shanghai from Beiping the night before last, reporting on the recent situation in North China to all sectors of society in Shanghai. At the same time, he discussed with various organizations how to assist the Northeast Volunteer Army and the Rehe Anti-Japanese forces with various important issues. Xiong plans to start working within a few days. Yesterday, our reporter paid a special visit to Xiong at his residence to inquire about the various situations in North China. He provided detailed information. The sections of the conversation that can be disclosed are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Rehe Urgently Needs Assistance</h3>
<p>Xiong said, "Rehe is the shield of North China. Therefore, since the Japanese army prepared to invade Rehe, our North China military authorities have also urgently planned to resist. Tang Yulin is in charge of Rehe, and the military and volunteer forces in various parts of Rehe are strong and determined to fight the enemy to the death. However, the rear transportation and supply are more difficult due to the terrain of Rehe. Now that the front line is fiercely resisting, rear assistance is particularly important. Therefore, the Northeast and Rehe Support Association is now actively planning to carry out assistance with the most convenient and efficient specific methods. Although Beiping and Tianjin both have local associations, it seems that both associations have local characteristics and cannot plan as a whole. Therefore, in the name of the Northeast and Rehe Support Association, we plan to discuss in detail with all sectors of Shanghai. The most needed items are funds, food, and heavy-duty vehicles. We hope that all sectors of Shanghai will do their best to help."</p>
<h3>Tight Defense in Beiping and Tianjin</h3>
<p>As for Beiping and Tianjin, our military authorities have been deploying tight defenses since the war broke out in Yuguan. There are considerable forces stationed near Beiping and Tianjin, on high alert.</p>
<h3>Speculation on Japanese Military Action</h3>
<p>Xiong also said that the Japanese army is determined to occupy Rehe. Therefore, before the outbreak of war in Rehe, they mobilized elite troops and prepared for a long time before launching an invasion. If Rehe is occupied, they will not invade Beiping and Tianjin for the time being. Otherwise, not only Beiping and Tianjin, but also the entire coastline of China will be disturbed by them.</p>
<h3>More Than One Hundred and Eighty Trade Associations Send a Joint Telegram Expressing Their Determination to Resist Japan and Defend the Country</h3>
<p>Economic Severance Kills the Enemy</p>
<p>Donate Money and Grain to Boost Morale</p>
<p>To the Nanjing Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Ministries and Commissions of the various Academies, the Party Headquarters of the Provinces and Cities, the Government of the Provinces, the Armies, Divisions, Brigades, Regiments, and the Public Organizations: We note that the violent Japanese troops are trampling the Northeast and occupying Yuguan. In order to respect the Covenant of the League of Nations and maintain world peace, we have not hesitated to endure humiliation and submit to international sanctions, hoping to uphold justice and realize fairness. Unexpectedly, the violent Japanese troops have shown no repentance. On the day when the League of Nations General Assembly openly discussed the Special Committee's report, and when the right and wrong were about to become clear, they disregarded the covenant and faith, and launched a general offensive on Rehe, invading North China with the troops of the entire country. The violent Japanese troops are not only enemies with us, but also enemies with the whole world. Therefore, in order to seek the survival of our nation and to fight for the safety of mankind in the world, we have no choice but to fight back head-on and put out this disturbance. We firmly believe that the world's justice has not been destroyed, and that there will be a day when we will overcome ourselves. Moreover, President Song of the Executive Yuan has taken office, and the government has sworn an oath that it will never give up the Northeast. Committee Chairman Zhang has also led all the generals to express their determination to defend the country by telegram. General Tang Yulin is practicing the vanguard of national defense. We, the people who are residing in the rear, are mindful of the duty that every citizen has to protect the country. At this critical moment when the country is at stake, we must do our best to be the country's support. We must vigorously implement economic severance to kill the enemy's economy, and donate money and grain to boost the morale of our soldiers. This is what our business community should be at the forefront of and cannot shirk. We must sharpen our swords and do our best to strive for the final victory. We are overwhelmed with grief and cannot help but weep. The Shanghai Silk Industry, Cotton Cloth Industry, Sugar Industry, Rice Industry, Coal Industry, Yarn Industry, South Goods Industry, Paper Industry, Ginseng and Bird's Nest Industry, Coal Ash Industry, Mercerized Cotton Weaving Industry, Wood Industry, Flying Flower Industry, North and South Goods, Exchange Industry, Color Printing Industry, Cigarette Factory Industry, Chinese Soap Industry, Western Medicine Industry, Candy Biscuit Canned Food Industry, Fruit and Ground Goods Industry, Medicinal Materials Industry, Sausage Industry, Western Pigment Industry, Advertising Industry, Transportation and Sales of Lime Industry, etc., 183 Trade Associations bowing,</p>
<h3>The Money Industry Convened a Delegates' Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<h3>Donating Funds to Assist the National Salvation Movement</h3>
<p>It Was Resolved That Each Bank Should Donate a Minimum of 500 Yuan</p>
<p>Funds Will Be Collected in Three Days, with Fukang Solely Donating 3,000 Yuan</p>
<p>With the situation in Northeast China becoming increasingly dangerous, the Shanghai money industry's desire to save the country does not lag behind others. Yesterday afternoon at 3 p.m., a meeting of member representatives was convened. It was unanimously agreed that the soldiers at the front were resisting with bloodshed and should be rewarded, that the compatriots in the Northeast were suffering greatly and needed relief, and that the aviation salvation movement was the most urgent task. It was proposed to raise funds to allocate assistance to fulfill the industry's small contribution to national salvation. It was unanimously resolved that each bank, together with the donations from its employees, should donate a minimum of 500 yuan. Those who could generously contribute more were welcome to do so. It is reported that the collection will begin in three days. A member of Fukang Bank donated 3,000 yuan on the spot, excluding the donations from its employees. This shows the money industry's unity against the enemy. The total amount collected in the future is expected to be considerable.</p>
<h3>The Delegation from All Sectors to Comfort the Anti-Japanese Soldiers Will Depart</h3>

<p>Dagon News Agency reports that the Committee of All Sectors in This City to Comfort the Anti-Japanese Soldiers decided that with the outbreak of the war in Rehe and the soldiers fighting bravely against the enemy, the people in the rear should give more comfort to boost morale.

<h3>Wang Yansong Takes Sick Leave</h3>
<p>Wang Yansong, Standing Committee Member of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and Supervisory Committee Member of the Municipal Party Headquarters, was recently elected by the Committee of All Sectors in This City to Comfort the Anti-Japanese Soldiers as the head of the delegation to comfort the soldiers in the Northeast. Wang wished to make the trip to pay his respects on behalf of the people of this city to the soldiers who were killing the enemy in the Northeast. However, due to running around for days and overworking, he was exhausted. In addition, Wang's physical strength was not strong to begin with, so he suddenly felt unwell and suffered from hemoptysis. Therefore, he was unable to make the trip to the north. He has now sent a letter to the committee asking them to elect another person to serve as the head of the delegation. Wang is now following his doctor's advice and has left Shanghai for Hangzhou to recuperate, and has sent letters to the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Municipal Defense Corps Management Committee to request a half-month leave.</p>
<h3>The Central Mint Will Begin Minting on the First of Next Month</h3>
<p>The Opening Ceremony Will Be Held That Afternoon</p>

The opening ceremony will be held from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. that afternoon, and guests from all sectors of society at home and abroad are invited to visit.

After the start of minting, the daily working hours will be tentatively set at ten hours, and it is estimated that 250,000 to 300,000 yuan of new coins will be produced daily. Most of the minting raw materials will be supplied by the Central Bank. In the future, outsiders can also entrust the mint to mint silver on their behalf by paying the prescribed handling fee.</p>
<h3>Wu Chaochu Pays Attention to the Protection of Civil Rights in the Constitution</h3>
<p>Sends a Letter to Sun Ke Suggesting</p>
<p>Special Provisions Should Be Added</p>
<p>Central Committee Member Wu Chaochu fraudulently sent a letter to President Sun Ke of the Legislative Yuan, saying, "Zhesheng, my dear brother, I have received your letter the other day, in which you have invited me to be a consultant to the Constitution Drafting Committee of the Legislative Yuan. In the future, if you have any questions, I will contribute what I know at any time to help you. Now, I would like to tell you about one thing that I have already thought about. The greatest purpose of the constitution is to seek happiness for the people, and the most important thing to seek happiness for the people is to protect the people's freedom and rights, and the most important thing to protect the people's freedom and rights is to protect the people's personal freedom. In our country, warlords are tyrannical and officials are willful. They arbitrarily trample on the people's personal freedom and often detain them without reason. Detention is not done through legal procedures, and after detention, there is no definite date for interrogation, and they are not released. This leads to long imprisonment and no way to appeal. Even if relatives and friends try to rescue them, there is no way to seek help except through requests and bribes. As a result, some are released without announcing the reason, while others are detained without release, and some are even subjected to private torture. Such dark situations only exist in the so-called chaotic times in our country's history and in Europe in the Middle Ages. Under such circumstances, even if the constitution clearly stipulates the protection of civil rights, it is only equal to a dead letter. Recently, scholars who are concerned about the times have organized societies to protect civil rights in order to remedy the situation, but I am afraid that it will be difficult to achieve significant results. In my opinion, it is impossible to achieve success without clearly stipulating a legal procedure for effective relief. The most comprehensive protection of the people's personal freedom in various countries is in the countries of the Anglo-American legal system. The reason why they can achieve this is due to the provision of the Writ</p>
<p>of Habeas Corpus in the law. When a person is detained by an agency, organization, or individual, he may request the senior court to issue this writ, ordering the detaining party to submit the body of the detained person to the court and state the reason for the detention to the court. The court then examines whether the reason for the detention is legal, but does not try the content of the case. Depending on whether the reason for the detention is sufficient, the court may order release, bail, or remand. This is a good and effective method that is best to emulate. Since the Republic of China, the provisional laws and constitutions promulgated have never failed to clearly state the protection of the people's personal freedom, but in reality, the people's personal freedom has not been protected at all. This is all because the protection is just empty talk, without legal procedures. Therefore, Western philosophers have said that procedural law is more important than substantive law. If the procedures for protection and relief are not prepared, empty talk about principles will not be able to be implemented. I believe that this relief method should be clearly stipulated in the constitution so that civil rights can be effectively protected and the law can be implemented. I respectfully submit my humble opinion to the constitution drafting officials for consideration. I wish you all the best."</p>
<h3>Cai Tingkai Replied to the Guangdong Fellow Villagers Association by Telegram</h3>
<p>The Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association sent telegrams to the armies of Guangdong and Guangxi, urging them to rush to the rescue as the Japanese invaded Rehe. Now, a reply telegram has been received from Director Cai Ting of Zhangzhou, which states: "To all gentlemen of the Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association, I have received your telegram. The Japanese invasion of Rehe was expected. We have been preparing for this for a long time. We are determined to sacrifice our patriotic blood again and again. Once the government orders, we will not lag behind. Thank you for your encouragement. Cai Tingkai, with respect."</p>
<h3>Local Association Representative Huang Yanpei and Others Returned to Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Detailed Account of the Strong Anti-Japanese Sentiment of the Northern People</p>

<h3>Huafeng Company Hosted Guests to Promote Kaicheng's Domestic Sulfuric Acid</h3>
<p>Huafeng Company, specializing in industrial raw materials for domestic factories, has been in operation for many years.

First, the host, Xie Xiaochu, gave a report, stating that sulfuric acid is a widely used raw material, essential for textile factories, dyeing and finishing factories, enamel factories, soda factories, and factories of all sizes. Before Kaicheng Company's invention, the sulfuric acid used by factories mostly depended on Japan and Germany. Although Xiangmao Foreign Firm had products, the prices were too high, the cost too expensive, and millions of dollars were drained away annually. Kaicheng Company spent much effort and many years researching the manufacturing method of sulfuric acid raw materials before succeeding, a significant industry beneficial to society. All of you are leaders in the industry and elders in the business community, and you are always enthusiastic about promoting domestic products. We sincerely hope that you will introduce domestic sulfuric acid to various factories. Next, Fang Yexian, manager of Kaicheng Company, reported on the establishment and products of Kaicheng Company. Subsequently, Lin Kanghou, Wang Xiaolai, and Zhu Wenqi gave speeches successively, expressing their admiration for Huafeng Company's enthusiasm for promoting domestic products, and hoping that they would supply various factories with the lowest possible prices and the best quality goods.</p>

<p>The case of acquiring civilian land in the Pengpu District for the construction of the new Shanghai North Railway Station, was submitted by the Executive Yuan to the four ministries of Interior, Railways, Finance, and Industry for deliberation. The original plan was maintained. The residents of the district requested reconsideration, arguing that there were thousands of fruit trees on the land, and the residents' losses were too great. The four ministries held another meeting last week, and representatives from the district were also present to explain the situation. It was decided that the Ministry of Railways would re-survey the land. Personnel have now been sent to Shanghai to conduct an on-site inspection. Furthermore, the Ministry of Railways had previously scheduled a meeting in Shanghai on the 25th to explain the special circumstances of establishing the station to all sectors of society, but this has now been postponed.</p>
<h3>After the Strike, Merchants and the Husi Union Petitioned</h3>
<p>After the rice merchants in this city went on strike, the Hulianyi Association of rice merchants in South Shanghai and various rice merchants jointly formed the Rice Merchant Committee. Yesterday, they also issued a declaration and hosted a press conference. Specifically, at 5:00 PM, they hosted reporters from various newspapers and news agencies at the Taohuagong on Avenue Min-ti-ni in the French Concession to report on everything that had happened, and the long-standing abuses of the Husi using heavy bushels and forcibly collecting bushel fees, the suffering endured by the rice merchants, and the demand for fair bushels. The petition stated: "Petition for a request. It is believed that the cause of this strike dispute is the Husi's heavy bushels, which have been attacked by newspapers in recent days, becoming the target of public criticism. Although the purpose of the strike is said to be to eliminate abuses, it is actually to implement the proposal for fair bushels, creating clever names, which is nothing more than sensationalizing and reversing cause and effect for eliminating abuses, without a thorough solution. If it is implemented according to its proposal, I am afraid that it will only be peaceful for a while, and it will be difficult to seek long-term stability. The Husi deeply fears that the past suffering will be repeated in the future. In order to maintain our inherent livelihood and seek a permanent solution, after the sixth meeting of the council of this association, it was recorded and should be written and submitted. We earnestly request your ministry and bureau to examine and approve, and consider the suffering of the Husi, which has been restricted for a long time. First, allow the Husi to lift the restrictions according to the established mediation principles, and organize the Shanghai Municipal Management Husi Committee by the union, and also request your bureau to send personnel to supervise the handling of the matter (the method will be submitted separately), so as to avoid any obstruction of the Husi's exercise of fair duties, manipulation from the middle, leading to violations of the light bushels, so that the suffering of the Husi can be relieved, the dispute can be easily settled, the bad habit of strikes can also be used as an excuse, people's food is not worried about scarcity, and society is naturally stable. Long-term resistance depends on it. Moreover, in inland areas such as Wuxi, Zhenting, Hangzhou, Hsia Shih, and other rice-producing areas, the Husi are all autonomous, and there is no precedent for being hired. The trading parties can trust and abide by each other. It is not difficult to investigate and imitate, taking the strengths of others to make up for our weaknesses. Why bother with fair bushels? Who believes that all the accumulated abuses can be eliminated and no more serious malpractices will occur than heavy bushels? If we can truly promote benefits and eliminate abuses, how dare the Husi be different? What we do not approve of is the incomprehensive nature. If we do not eliminate evil completely, we will plant evil causes in the future. The Husi will be the first to bear the brunt, not to mention the impact on people's food and security, which is of great importance. Therefore, we have detailed the advantages and disadvantages and submitted a written request, earnestly requesting your ministry and bureau to examine and approve, allow the Husi to lift the restrictions, and manage themselves by the union, so as to cut off the source of disputes and leave a little bit of livelihood, not to wait for orders. Respectfully submitted."</p>

<h3>Yesterday Afternoon, a Shooting Incident Caused by the Vietnamese Police in Xinqiao Street</h3>
<p>Vietnamese Police Arrested Because Two Women Shared a Rickshaw</p>
<p>The Rickshaw License on the Vehicle Was Torn Off</p>
<p>Bystanders Mediated, Feeling Greatly Indignant</p>
<p>The Vietnamese Police Opened Fire, Killing One Person</p>
<p>| The Vietnamese Police Have Been Placed Under Custody |</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at two o'clock, two women were riding in the same rickshaw, traveling north on Minguo Road into Xinqiao Street. When passing the Ningbo Hotel, they were stopped by Annamese police officer No. 427, who claimed that two people could not ride in one rickshaw. At the same time, he tore off the rickshaw's license. The women got out of the car themselves. Because the license was torn off, the rickshaw puller wanted the Annamese police to return it, but the police resolutely refused. He also demanded that the rickshaw puller and the two women be taken to the police station together. The two women claimed they had urgent business and offered to pay a fine of five jiao to settle the matter, but the police officer still refused and blocked and beat the rickshaw puller. This aroused the indignation of bystanders, who gathered to reason and mediate with the police officer. The police officer threatened the crowd with a rifle. Suddenly, there was a loud bang, and a bullet flew out. The crowd scattered in all directions. When the Annamese police officer fired the gun, Zhu Guting, a shop assistant at Renhe Grain Store, No. 61 Shoulu Lane, Xinqiao Street, was the first to be hit. The bullet pierced through his lower abdomen, and fresh blood gushed out. His large intestine also flowed out of his abdomen with the blood, and he died instantly. Behind him, a passerby named Liu Fugao (39 years old), a native of Zhejiang, was also shot in the abdomen. He is now in critical condition at Renji Hospital. After the incident, the French authorities paid close attention to the matter. They believed that it was inappropriate for the Vietnamese police officer to carry firearms while on duty and carelessly injure people, resulting in death. The police officer was ordered to be placed under custody, and the police chief, Mr. Fei Bai, immediately ordered the police officer's immediate superior to conduct a detailed investigation and punish him according to the law, to emphasize the importance of human life.</p>
<p>In another report, Xu Lianzhen and Zhang Fengying, two women from Suzhou, both around 20 years old, lived together at No. 10, Yu Kang Lane, Pi Shaonai Road, outside Xiaobeimen in the French Concession. At 1:30 p.m. yesterday, the two women went out together and wanted to go to the Sincere Company in Beishi. At the entrance of the lane, they hired a rickshaw pulled by a Jiangbei man named Shen Fangrong (who lived on a small boat by the Hebangbian River on Xujiahui Road in the French Concession), which had a three-sided license (i.e., valid in the British, French, and Chinese areas). The two women sat together and traveled east on Minguo Road. When passing the iron gate at the intersection of Dongxinqiao Street and Minguo Road, it was exactly 1:45 p.m. An armed Vietnamese police officer No. 427 from the Mailan Police Station, who was on duty from 12:00 to 4:00, happened to see two women sitting together in the rickshaw, which violated the regulations. The police officer stepped forward to stop them and moved forward to pry off the license nailed to the back of the rickshaw. At that time, the rickshaw puller stopped the rickshaw. The two women in the rickshaw scolded the rickshaw puller for not taking Zilaihuo Street but coming this way. Unexpectedly, it was seen by passersby, who stopped to watch. For a moment, the sound of people arguing became louder and louder, and the number of people gathered increased, and the voices became more and more chaotic. The Vietnamese police officer did not understand Chinese and mistakenly thought that the passersby wanted to make things difficult for him. He wanted to scare away the onlookers with the rifle he was carrying on his shoulder. Unexpectedly, the bullet was loaded and the safety was not closed, causing the trigger to be pulled. The bullet flew out, killing one person and injuring three bystanders. One was Zhu Guting, a 20-year-old Chaozhou man who was the accountant at the Renhe Sugar Food Store opened by Chen Fengyou, a Chaozhou man at No. 134 Dongxinqiao Street. The bullet entered from behind his left shoulder blade and pierced through his chest below his left breast, and he fell to the ground and died instantly. One of the injured was Liu Fugao (a Ningbo man, a friend of a shop assistant at Yuantaiheng Sugar Store on Yangxing Street), who was shot in the abdomen and whose intestines also flowed out. Another was Zhao Changxing (age and origin unknown, living at No. 24, Dawang Temple), who was shot in the left arm. Another was Xu Linsheng (34 years old, a local resident, address unknown), who was shot in the left arm. Because of the extreme pain, they all fell to the ground. At that time, other police officers nearby heard the gunshot and rushed to the scene. They arrested the woman Xu Lianzhen and the rickshaw puller. Zhang fled from the crowd after the incident. Xu and the rickshaw puller, along with the Vietnamese police officer, were taken to the police station for investigation. At the same time, the police station sent an ambulance to take Zhu's body to the Tongren Fuyuan branch mortuary for an autopsy and reported to the court to send someone to examine the body. Liu Fugao, who was injured, was sent to Renji Hospital, and Zhao Changxing was sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Xu Linsheng went to a hospital in Jiumudi for treatment. Afterwards, the deputy chief of the French police station, Pu Nanxuan, and the chief detective went to the scene of the incident to investigate the situation and examine Zhu's body. According to hospital news at 1:00 this morning, Liu Fugao had died of his injuries.</p>
<h3>Snow Fell in This City Last Night</h3>
<p>Lasted About One Hour</p>
<p>In recent days, the weather has been warm and humid. The day before yesterday (the 23rd), it rained all day, and the next morning it cleared up suddenly, but the temperature dropped sharply, and a north wind rose suddenly. Even wearing light fur, one still felt shivering. The wind was still strong yesterday, and the temperature was the same as the day before. At 9:20 p.m., it suddenly snowed, and it stopped after about an hour.</p>
<h3>A Young Man, Concerned About National Affairs, Resolved to Join the Army</h3>
<h3>A Letter to His Father Said</h3>
<p>If the Country Exists, the Home Naturally Exists; If the Country is Destroyed, Where is the Home?</p>
<p>Yu Yinwei (22 years old), a native of Huzhou, used to work at the General Post Office on North Sichuan Road. On the 18th of this month, Yu Jun was scheduled to go to the office, but he never returned. Seven or eight days have passed, and he has neither returned home nor gone to the office. His family was very anxious when they suddenly received a letter from Yu Jun from the front line. Only then did they learn that he had disregarded his own safety and joined the volunteer army to go north to fight the enemy. As he was the only son of his parents, the family grieved and cried after receiving the letter. They asked the postmaster of the General Post Office for instructions. The postmaster, sympathetic to Yinwei's ambition to serve the country, agreed to continue to hold his position. If Tu Jun could return to Shanghai soon, he could still work at the post office, so as to relieve his family's worries. The original letter is as follows:</p>
<p>Respectfully to my uncle,</p>
<p>I have not been able to serve you for several days, and I am very worried. But there is really no other way. It is only because the Japanese invaders are strong, occupying the three northeastern provinces, killing our compatriots, and bombing our houses. All kinds of atrocities are unheard of. Thinking about it makes my heart ache. Recently, the newspapers reported that they have invaded Rehe. If this continues, what will be the outcome? That is why I have joined the volunteer army and gone north. Please don't worry. You must know that if the country exists, the home will naturally exist; if the country is destroyed, where will the home be? Now, my friend, Jun, is a graduate of the Municipal North High School and is very fluent in Chinese and Western languages. Now that he is idle at home, I beg my uncle to find a place for him. Please, please. When I defeat the Japanese army and flatten Fusang, I will see you again. The military bugle is sounding again, so I will end this hastily. (Below omitted)</p>
<h3>Tragedy of a Night Shift Liner Crashing into an Oil Tanker</h3>
<p>Two Crew Members Drowned in Their Sleep The Entire Cargo of Kerosene Floated on the River Surface</p>
<p>Ma Changyuan, a Shaoxing halogen basket boat, loaded 550 barrels of kerosene from the Shanghai Qiaji Kerosene Company, intending to go to Shaoxing for unloading. He arrived at Song at noon the day before yesterday and docked at the Baotaiwan Customs, opposite the Dongpu beach where the ship was stationed. Because of the formalities such as customs declaration and signing, he could not leave the port that day and waited until dawn to set sail. Unexpectedly, before dawn (at 4:00 a.m. on the 24th), a Yangtze River liner leaving Shanghai passed near the place where the sailboat was docked and broke the bow of Ma Changyuan's ship, which sank immediately. As a result, the crew members Zhao Ajiu, 40 years old, and Zhou Erba, 33 years old, both from Shaoxing, who were sleeping in the bow cabin, could not escape and fell into the water with the ship. They have disappeared and are believed to have drowned. The captain, Wang Erlong, and six other crew members were awakened from their sleep and, seeing that they were in danger, cried out for help. They were rescued by nearby boatmen. All the kerosene on board was lost and floated on the river surface, resulting in huge losses. After causing the accident, the ship not only did not stop to rescue but also sped away. After being rescued and reborn, Captain Wang Erlong immediately reported to the Zhanghuabang River Affairs Office. The deputy river affairs officer took a boat to the scene of the accident for a week of investigation before returning to the office. He then reported the situation to the river affairs office to investigate the name of the ship that caused the accident in order to clarify the truth and facilitate negotiations.</p>
<h3>The Chicago Exposition Seeks Famous Paintings by Fang Junbi</h3>
<h3>Eight Recent Works Have Been Sent</h3>
<p>The Chinese Collection Exhibition of the Chicago Exposition in the United States has recently opened in Shanghai and will soon be shipped to the United States for display. He Bingxian, the person in charge of the exhibition, believes that Oriental art is famous in the world, but there are too many oil paintings this time, which is not enough to promote national glory. Therefore, he discussed with Ms. Fang Biju (wife of Tieci Zeng Zhongwu), a famous painter, and obtained her consent to collect her latest masterpieces: [Riding a Donkey in Fine Rain Through Jianmen], [Fishing Alone in the Cold River Snow], [A Child's Sleep], [Chrysanthemum], [Plum Blossom], [Taoist Priest], [Lushan Waterfall], [Still Life]. These eight paintings will add luster to the entire exhibition. Ms. Fang graduated from the French Higher School of Fine Arts and was a disciple of the famous French painters Inbert and Bernard. Her works have been selected for the Paris Art Exhibition several times. Various newspapers have commented that her works have a delicate and profound thought and are free from any artificiality. She can integrate the strengths of the East, West, South, and North and is regarded as an outstanding female painter in the East. After returning to China, National Guangdong University and Zhixin School successively hired her as a professor.</p>
<h3>Zhengtai Rubber Factory Provides Compensation to the Families of Workers Who Died Tragically</h3>
<p>The details of the case of the Zhengtai Rubber Factory No. 1 on Tangshan Road in this city, where more than 80 male and female workers were burned to death in an electrical fire a few days ago, have been recorded in previous issues of this newspaper. It is now known that the shareholders of the factory, in consideration of the fact that the deceased workers suffered a tragic death, which is truly pitiful, have specially given each bereaved family a compensation fee of 300 yuan, and the families have issued receipts to collect the money. It is said that two-thirds of the families have already received the money, and the factory is now notifying the families who have not received the money to go and collect it. As for the workers who were not affected, in addition to the regular monthly salary for one month, those who return home for recuperation will be given some travel expenses. After the repair of the factory building of Factory No. 1 is completed, they will be notified to return to work. In addition, it is reported that the bodies of 81 male and female workers who died in the factory have been placed in silk cotton quilts by Pushan Villa and are temporarily stored in the Xinjiangyin Public Office. After the completion of the factory's own cemetery in the Dachang Township area, they will be moved there for burial. The cemetery covers an area of more than three mu and is surrounded by high walls, which is very spectacular. Special personnel will be sent to pay tribute during the spring and autumn seasons to comfort the spirits.</p>
<h3>The Ford Motor Company in the United States Resumes Normal Operations</h3>
<p>Suspended for Several Days in January Due to External Influences</p>
<p>The car bodies used for passenger vehicles by the Ford Motor Company in the United States are mostly supplied by the Brigg Body Company. In January of this year, some workers at the Brigg factory went on strike. As a result, Ford's source of passenger car bodies was greatly reduced, and this agency did not belong to Ford and could not be controlled. Therefore, it had to be temporarily suspended. For a time, the rumor that Ford factories in various places were on strike was due to this. Fortunately, after a few days, the labor unrest at the Brigg factory subsided, and the supply of passenger car bodies was restored as before. The Ford factories also resumed normal operations. In fact, the Ford Motor Company in the United States has always treated its workers very well, which is well known in the world. There has never been any so-called labor unrest.</p>
<h3>New Train Schedule for the Songhu Branch Line</h3>
<p>Starting March 1st, Two Additional Passenger Trains Will Be Added in Each Direction</p>
<p>In order to facilitate passengers at the Songhu branch line stations of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the Traffic Department of the Railway has decided to add two additional passenger trains in each direction between Baoshan Road and Baotaiwan, starting from March 1st.

<h3>The Appeal of Two Kidnappers Was Rejected</h3>
<p>The Original Sentence of 20 Years Imprisonment Was Upheld</p>
<p>Lu Heshang and Yu Haitao, two kidnappers from Tongzhou, kidnapped Hengfu, the eight-year-old grandson of Zhang Yunji, a Ningbo businessman who lived at No. 59 Ga'en Road in the French Concession, at 4:20 p.m. on November 24th of last year, with the help of their accomplices. The kidnappers escaped in a cargo truck, and the family of the victim hired a rickshaw puller, Mao Xiaotao, to chase them from behind and shout for help. The detectives intercepted the kidnappers at the intersection of Fuli Road and Jufu Road, rescued the victim, and sent Lu and Yu to the Second Special District Court. They were sentenced to 20 years of imprisonment each. Because Lu and Yu felt that the sentence was too heavy, they expressed their dissatisfaction with the original judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Higher Court. The court has already opened a trial and concluded the case, waiting for sentencing. The details have been recorded in previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhou, accompanied by assessors Guo and Fan, and Chief Prosecutor Zhao Shibei, came to the Third Criminal Court at 3:00 to bring in the appellants to pronounce the judgment. The appeal was rejected. They also explained the reasons for the judgment to the appellants, saying that kidnapping cases should be punishable by death. The original sentence of 20 years imprisonment was already a lenient reduction. Your appeals are unreasonable, so the judgment is rejected. After the pronouncement, the appellants were returned to custody to await instructions.</p>
<h3>Cai Shutang, Manager of Biefa Pharmacy, Was Accused of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Ren Chunrong, a native of Shaoxing, opened the Biefa Pharmacy at No. 819 on the corner of Zha Road and Kader Road in August of last year with his own funds, with a capital of more than 40,000 yuan. He hired Cai Shutang, a native of Ningbo, as the manager. After opening for several months, the business was not prosperous, so he announced the liquidation at the end of January of this year. All the account books of the pharmacy were entrusted to accountant Xie Chunpu for liquidation. During the liquidation, accountant Xie discovered that manager Cai Shutang had embezzled a huge sum of 6,792.22 yuan. He reported this to Ren Chunrong, who reported it to the Jing'an Temple Police Station the day before yesterday. The Chinese detective Wang Yongjun was sent to No. 11 Yian Lane, Kader Road, to arrest Cai and take him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The plaintiff, Ren Chunrong, hired lawyers Xie Chunming and Zhang Qingtong to appear in court. Lawyer Wang of the police station stated the case, saying that an important witness in the case, Xu Fushou, the accountant of the pharmacy, had returned to his hometown of Shaoxing and was unable to appear in court today. He requested a postponement. Ren Chunrong also complained that accountant Xie had discovered that the defendant had embezzled the above-mentioned amount, but there were still accounts that could not be clarified for a while. When questioned, the defendant Cai Shutang confessed that since the preparation and opening of Biefa Pharmacy, he had been hired by Ren as the manager, and the accountant Xu Fushou was hired by Ren. The pharmacy's capital was said to be more than 40,000 yuan, but more than 20,000 yuan of it was taken away by Ren for other transactions. The remaining amount was clearly accounted for and signed by him, including more than 4,000 yuan for the purchase of business property and decoration, 1,600 taels for the small house rental, 100 taels per month for rent, 6,000 yuan for medicine dispensing fees, and more than 2,000 yuan for printed materials and bottle materials, all of which can be verified by clear accounts. Therefore, not only did he not embezzle, but there was still a surplus of funds in the pharmacy, because Ren owed him more than 1,000 yuan for room rent and miscellaneous expenses, as the pharmacy's pharmaceutical factory rented his remaining house, with a monthly rent of 70 yuan, which had not been paid for eight months, etc. Finally, the defendant's lawyer requested that the defendant be allowed to be released on bail during the adjournment. Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession and ordered Cai to be released on bail of 3,000 yuan from a shop. The case was adjourned for further hearing.</p>
<h3>The Hearing of the Case of the Gauze Exchange Was Concluded</h3>
<p>During the Japanese invasion of Shanghai on February 9th of last year, the Gauze Exchange closed all transactions of its clients, and the clients, including Sha Weiyi, filed a lawsuit for confirmation. The Exchange lost in the first instance and filed an appeal, adding lawyers Liu Chongyou and Zhang Shizhao. The case was repeatedly tried by Mr. Hu Yigu, the former presiding judge of the Civil Division of the Second Higher Court, and the debate had been concluded. Unexpectedly, before the sentencing date, the case was changed to a re-opening of the debate. After Judge Hu resigned, Judge Li Lian continued to hold several hearings and investigated in detail. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00, the last hearing for the conclusion of the debate was held. The appellant lawyers from both sides were present, and Wu Mo, a lawyer, was added to the side of Sha Weiyi to appear in court. The debate between the two sides was very intense. When the court adjourned, it was already dusk. Judge Wu announced that the case would be sentenced on March 4th at 1:00 p.m.</p>
<h3>The Case Against the Star Daily Was Concluded</h3>
<p>Chen Dieyi Fined 50 Yuan</p>
<p>The Star Daily was accused by the police station of publishing advertisements for Huang Shifeng's medical treatment and Detang Hospital's amenorrhea and menorrhagia medicines on February 9th, which the police station's security department considered to be related to morality. The editor-in-chief of the newspaper, Chen Dieyi, was summoned to the First Special Court on the morning of the 18th for a trial. Huang Shifeng and Shang Daosheng, the manager of Detang Hospital, were summoned to testify, and the trial was adjourned for one week. The trial was continued in the Second Court yesterday morning. First, lawyer Li Zhishan of the police station stated the case, accusing Chen Dieyi of publicly introducing abortion methods in violation of Article 308 of the Criminal Code, Article 44 of assisting the principal offender, and Article 251 of the Publication Law of disseminating or selling obscene texts and pictures. The witness Huang Shifeng did not arrive, and only Shang Daosheng appeared in court, admitting that he had published the advertisement. Next, Chen Dieyi was questioned. Chen confessed that the police station had not taken any action against the medical and pharmaceutical parties who published advertisements in the Star Daily, and the Star Daily had no right to refuse to publish their advertisements. Moreover, publishing advertisements was different from publishing news. If there was any meaning of recommending others in the news, he should be responsible. As for the advantages and disadvantages of medical advertisements, he had not tried them and could not distinguish them, so he could not take the blame for others. Then, Shao Shengzu, the lawyer representing the defendant, stood up to defend, saying that advertising was a business nature. The advertisement belonged to a formal doctor and hospital, and the medicine had been sold for many years. The police station had not investigated and banned it, and there were no words of war or public introduction of abortion methods in the advertisement, so the crime of Article 308 could not be established. As for the article of Article 251, which disseminates or sells obscene texts and pictures, only the names of medicines are found in the advertisement, and there is no obscenity at all, so this crime cannot be established. The clause in Article 14 is [assisting the principal offender is an accomplice]. Now, since there is no principal offender, it is even more ridiculous to add the name of an accomplice to our client. In short, the police station does not ban or sue the abortion of idlers that the police station considers, but accuses our client of having a criminal act, which is a complete abandonment of the root and pursuit of the branch, and should be ordered to be innocent. At this point, Judge Wu declared the debate concluded and sentenced Chen Dieyi to a fine of 50 yuan for the crime of introducing abortion by writing. Chen Dieyi stated in court that he would give up the appeal and then tried other cases.</p>
<h3>Negotiation Between Mei Lanfang to Film Farewell My Concubine</h3>
<p>The Contract Fee Must Be 100,000 Yuan; If Filmed, It Will Not Be Performed Again</p>
<p>After the famous actor Mei Lanfang was hired by the Tianchan Stage at a high price to come to Shanghai to perform, he did not return north after the expiration of his contract and temporarily resided in Shanghai. Recently, a film company in this city hired someone to invite actor Mei to film his signature play, Farewell My Concubine, into a movie with sound effects. After repeated consultations, it was heard that Mei had agreed, but it was required that the contract fee for filming the play should be 100,000 yuan, and the other supporting roles were not included in this number. It was also stipulated that after the sound film of Farewell My Concubine was filmed, actor Mei would no longer sing this play in the future. The company thought that the cost was too high and asked a friend to ask actor Mei to reduce the contract fee.</p>

Unfortunately, she fell onto the tracks and had her legs crushed by the wheels. Her family sent her to the hospital, but treatment was ineffective. She died at three o'clock yesterday morning and was sent to the coroner's office for examination.</p>

<p>Recent News of the Severe Disaster in the Northwest</p>
<p>Demolishing Houses, Selling Materials, Selling Daughters, and Selling Sons</p>
<p>Digging Graves and Opening Coffins in Hopes of a Single Meal</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Disaster Prevention Association on Sixth Avenue in this city received a telegram yesterday from Yang Shuzhi, a representative of the Xiaohui Yizhen Association of Beiping, who went to Shaanxi to investigate the disaster. The telegram stated that Shaanxi has suffered from continuous drought for five years, and the disaster is severe and unprecedented. To this day, the suffering is even more intense. The people of the country are currently struggling with national difficulties and seem to no longer pay attention to these starving compatriots. As a result, those in Shaanxi who are trying to provide relief are shouting and pleading, but with little effect. Yang Shuzhi was entrusted by his association to come to Shaanxi to investigate the disaster. As soon as he arrived in the Tanshibao area of Xi'an, he saw piles of building materials from houses that had been demolished and sold by the disaster victims, stacked like mountains. Tools and belongings were scattered on the ground, and the selling victims were all gaunt and skeletal, with glowing eyes like ghosts. Their eyes were filled with tears, and they wanted to cry out. As soon as a passerby stopped, they would grab at their clothes and beg them to buy something. When asked about their hometowns, most of them were from Fufeng, Wu Gong, Qishan, Mei County, Qian County, and Liquan, with some from Jingyang, Xianyang, Xingping, and Yuan County. Gray-haired old women led their daughters to sell, and young men knelt and called out "Father" to potential buyers, filling the streets, a scene too unbearable to watch. Even more tragic, tombs in the Jingyang area were being dug up, and every temple was being demolished. It is said that the timber from the demolished temples could be sold, and clothes could be obtained from the excavated tombs. Moreover, most of the people digging up the graves were their own children, who were either unwilling to dig but could not avoid it. They exposed the bones of their ancestors and sold the coffins of their deceased to obtain a single meal. Nothing could be more cruel than this. Now, even searching for grass seeds to fill their stomachs or digging up turnips for food is no longer possible. Furthermore, the new wheat seeds were sown after the snow and have not been properly watered, and many have withered and died. If it does not rain again in ten days, the harvest will be hopeless. This kind of situation is heartbreaking to see. Relief can be divided into two types: work relief and emergency relief. The disaster in Shaanxi was caused by, in addition to the opium poppy cultivation, inconvenient transportation, undeveloped water conservancy, and stagnant industry. If we can enthusiastically donate funds and work with Shaanxi to build more car routes to facilitate transportation, complete the Jing River and Wei River diversion projects, dig more self-flowing wells to develop water conservancy, and establish spinning and weaving factories to revitalize industry, then the current disaster victims can avoid death by working, and future disasters can also be prevented. This is the best of the work relief measures. For the widowed, orphaned, old, and weak, who are on the verge of death and cannot benefit from work relief, nothing is better than establishing porridge kitchens and distributing dry food. This is the most urgent form of emergency relief. I implore you to generously assist and do your best to promote it.</p>
<h3>Tracks of Contemporary Figures</h3>

<h3>New Resolution on the French Municipal Council's Cross-Boundary Road Construction and Telephone</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement</p>
<p>The Shanghai Times reported that the French Municipal Council submitted a resolution to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement yesterday regarding the cross-boundary road construction and telephone contract. The content was not disclosed by either party. However, the Shanghai Times reporter learned from reliable sources that the French authorities no longer have any problems with the Shanghai Telephone Company including the extra rental fee for each telephone stipulated in the contract in the company's arrears account and considering it again when adjusting the telephone fee in 1931. However, they believe that the money reported to the Chinese authorities should be borne by the company or the users of the International Settlement, and should not be included in the arrears account, so that all users jointly and indirectly bear the burden, because the cross-boundary road areas are adjacent to the International Settlement and have nothing to do with the French Concession. According to the company's estimate, the extra rental fee will only indirectly cost each user a few cents per quarter. This resolution of the French Municipal Council will cause this long-standing issue to be disputed again.</p>
<h3>Reorganization of Newspaper Sales on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway</h3>
<p>Directly Distributed by the Newspaper Association</p>
<p>All Newspapers Sold at the Listed Price</p>
<p>Newspaper sales on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo railway lines have always been contracted by merchants through bidding by the railway bureau. Occasionally, merchants focus on profit and neglect service. Newspaper prices are not fixed, and private sales are unavoidable. Furthermore, the trains also sell sundries and merchandise, which is noisy and annoying to passengers. Therefore, the railway bureau canceled the sale of sundries last year and only sold books and newspapers. At the end of January this year, when the contract with the contractor for the Beijing-Shanghai line expired, the railway bureau signed a method for distributing books and newspapers on trains with the Shanghai Newspaper Association, while simultaneously canceling merchandise and reducing the bid price (the previous bid was 550 yuan per month, now reduced to 500 yuan). All book and newspaper sales on the trains will be directly distributed by the Shanghai Newspaper Association and sold at the listed price on each newspaper. The association has a price list for compliance, without any private increases. Magazines, pictorials, and Western newspapers will also be sold to serve passengers. All newspaper sellers will be strictly trained by the association, wearing neat uniforms and badges. Furthermore, the railway bureau believes that there are many passengers at the five major stations of Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and Nanjing, and there should also be newspaper sales facilities.</p>
<h3>Reader's Counselor</h3>
<p>Working and Falling in Love</p>
<p>[Letter from Wei Yingjun, this city]</p>
<p>Dear Editor: I am currently an apprentice worker in a national goods factory. Due to my poor family, I often dropped out of school during my childhood, but fortunately, I was able to graduate from elementary school. After graduation, I studied in a mainland store, but the life was certainly not satisfactory to me. Last winter, due to various circumstances, I came to Shanghai to seek employment. Unexpectedly, I became an apprentice worker. I work hard during work hours and think hard during my free time. It has been three months since then. Some people have ridiculed me as a worker who is not even as good as a worker, yet I am still at ease. How boring and meaningless is that?</p>
<p>I think this decadent and irrelevant ridicule is unconscious ridicule, and there is absolutely no need to reply. In my hometown, family, friends, and relatives, no one would have thought that I would become a worker. Many even praised me, saying: "With your diligence in reading, the heavens will not fail those who work hard. Now that you have come to Shanghai, you are happy! You are enjoying life!" Whenever I see such words, I hate that I have read so few books and cannot use extremely painful words to express my life and intentions. For myself, I proudly never relied on family or relatives to make a living and was able to be self-reliant through hard work. I felt comforted in my heart. However, whenever I think that working is not a long-term plan, not only will my family be hurt when they hear about it, but if my other friend knows about it, we will both lose our lifelong happiness. Whenever I think of this, my heart aches. This "other friend" is my lifelong partner. Every man at a certain age wants to love; I am no exception. Let me tell you about it! When I was studying in a mainland store, the store owner's daughter considered me based on my daily actions and abilities. Half a year after I entered the store, she fell in love with me. I was very surprised by this romance because her talent, appearance, and advice were all pleasing to me. After half a year of friendship and love, last winter, she came to tell me every night that she had discussed our marriage with her mother, and to her delight, the old lady did not object. However, her father still thought in the old way, "Raising a daughter is hoping for a high-ranking family." If you can find a better job, this marriage will not be difficult to achieve, and you can be sure of it. That's what she told me. Originally, I was not accustomed to the life in the store, and the various actions of the merchants made me dissatisfied. After hearing her words, I immediately told her, "I will definitely change my job." I said changing jobs was very likely because I had already found a trainee position in Shanghai through a friend's recommendation. "Life is not always as you wish, eight or nine times out of ten." Due to illness, I arrived in Shanghai only five days late. When I arrived, the trainee position had already been filled by someone recommended by the factory's shareholders. Therefore, I resolutely became a worker. I was extremely sorry to her. Every time she writes, she expresses her passionate feelings and says that her father has agreed, but we must wait until I am promoted to a staff member before we can officially get engaged, with a deadline of two years. This letter arrived a week ago, and she has urged me to reply twice this week. I hesitated for a long time. Abandoning her, unless I never marry for the rest of my life, otherwise, it will be difficult to find this kind of qualified woman again. There are many good women in the world, but how can they be willing to marry a poor man without talent or wealth? Besides, she has never let me down, and has never despised me for being poor and chaste. She even helped me economically to buy books. How can I bear to abandon this affection? If I agree to her conditions, I know her father's character well. His words and deeds have never changed in the slightest. He has limited me to being promoted to a staff member within two years. With my talent and learning, having only studied for six years, and the overstaffing in Chinese society, I think reaching promotion to a staff member in two years is only a dream! Moreover, I fundamentally hope to study the meaning of industrial work. The facts of the past three months have proven this to me. Although my face is covered in mud and my clothes are stained with oil, I am not discouraged by this. On the contrary, I often tell myself: "If the typical Chinese life can be like this, at least we can hope to be on par with the great powers." As for my personal life, what is the interest in being a staff member or a trainee, except for more money? In short, I feel that being an apprentice, except for being scolded and beaten, and suffering physical losses, my spirit is extremely happy! Sometimes I really want to honestly tell my father and her, but I never have the courage. Now, because of her letter, I am touched by everything. The thinking of older people is: work is humble, work is ignorant and uneducated! Dear Editor: Being in such a complex environment, how should I deal with it? My personal mind and brainpower feel too short to apply. Please, sir, give me some advice. How should I reply to her? How should I deal with my family? Reply will be published tomorrow. Sun Shenfang's lofty friendship is commendable.</p>
<p>After this column revealed Mr. Wu of Zhenhai's letter "Nowhere to Go" (see this column on the 21st of this month), we immediately received a letter from Mr. Sun Shenfang of this city, willing to use his personal strength to help Mr. Wu continue his studies. His enthusiasm is truly admirable. In addition to forwarding the letter to Mr. Wu and asking him to contact Mr. Sun directly, this column believes that Mr. Sun's enthusiasm is rare and should not be ignored. Therefore, we will commend him in this column and thank Mr. Sun on behalf of Mr. Wu.</p>
<p>In preparation, the association will continue to assign uniformed newspaper sellers to sell various Shanghai newspapers at the five stations. The prices will be the same as those sold on the trains. This is the spirit of pure service of the Newspaper Association. The Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau strives to facilitate passengers, so they cooperate with each other. One reduces the bid amount, and the other sells at the listed price. From then on, the order of the railway will be well-organized, noise can be avoided, and newspaper prices will be uniform, without causing confusion. This is what the authorities and passengers hope for. The above-mentioned measures were implemented on March 1st. From now on, if passengers encounter newspaper sellers with price differences or lack of courtesy, they can point out their badge number, date, and train number at any time and send a letter to the Shanghai Newspaper Association for investigation and improvement.</p>

<h3>Russian Commits Suicide Due to Melancholy</h3>
<p>[Hangs Himself on his Name Day Due to Sentimental Reflections]</p>
<p>Russian Chetinov, 36 years old, worked as a chauffeur at the Asia Petroleum Company and lived in the company's warehouse at 2843 Yangshupu Road. The day before yesterday was his name day. It is unknown what stimulated him, but he suddenly had thoughts of ending his life. He went alone to a bathroom in his residence and hanged himself with a silk scarf on a tap pipe. He was discovered later, already dead. The Yangshupu Police Station was immediately notified and sent detectives to investigate. His body was taken to the Philen Road Coroner's Office. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Local Court was requested to send Prosecutor Guo Wei to the office to examine the body and open a public case. According to the Western detective's report, the deceased had been working as a driver at the Asia Company for seven years. He was usually diligent and thrifty, so he still had a passbook with 800 yuan in savings. Therefore, his sudden suicide was not suspected to be due to economic problems. However, he had a wife and daughter, whom he divorced for some reason 14 years ago, so his wife and daughter are now in his hometown. The day before yesterday was his name day, and according to custom, he was supposed to invite guests to celebrate. Presumably, because his wife had separated from him and was not present, he felt depressed and had thoughts of death. Furthermore, according to Russian Qu Tinav, the deceased was his cousin, and he is now claiming the body. After hearing the confession, Mr. Guo ruled that the deceased Russian Chetinov had hanged himself before death. The body was handed over to Qu Tinav with a guarantee to take it back for coffin and burial.</p>
<h3>Gan Jianxian Passes Away</h3>
<p>Gan Jianxian, brother of Gan Jingxian, lawyer of the Shanghai Municipal Council's legal group, was the beloved son-in-law of Tang Shaoyi, a famous figure in diplomatic circles. He graduated from New York University in the United States and worked in the accounting department of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Bureau for many years. He was always diligent in his work and was highly valued by his superiors. He fell ill due to overwork and took leave to be treated at the Guangci Hospital. However, Heaven did not grant him many years, and he died in the hospital on the 23rd night at the young age of 42. Relatives and friends were deeply saddened by the news. His brother, lawyer Gan Jingxian, was particularly grieved and asked for leave for a few days to assist with the funeral arrangements. Yesterday, those who went to the Gan residence to offer condolences included Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Municipal Government Secretary-General Yu Hongjun, Jianghai Customs Supervisor Tang Haian, and others. The remains have been moved to the Universal Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road in western Shanghai for coffin and burial. The funeral will be held at 1:30 PM on the 27th. At that time, those who go to express their condolences will definitely be a grand procession of plain cars and white horses.</p>

<h3>City News</h3>
<p>The Grand China Ballroom is about to be completed. The location of the Grand China Ballroom is at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Songshan Road.

<p>Mao Quantai Furniture Store General Factory Resumes. Mao Quantai Furniture Store has been in business for more than 30 years and has a good reputation. Not only does it have special influence in the Nanyang Islands and the Guangzhou and Hong Kong areas, but the number of Chinese antique furniture shipped to the United States every year is quite large. It is one of the leading large furniture stores in Shanghai. The issuing office is located on North Sichuan Road, and the general factory is located on Tiyuhui Road. During the January 28th Incident last year, the general factory was hit by artillery fire and suffered heavy losses. After much planning by General Manager Mao Yuxiang, the factory has now been completely restored to its original state. The factory site is larger than before, covering more than 20 acres. The buildings are sturdy and beautiful, and the interior and exterior arrangements are even better than before. There are more than 500 craftsmen. The factory has perfect equipment and adopts scientific management methods. Workers' security is guaranteed, and safety is ensured. Therefore, they all work diligently. There are two large storage rooms that can accommodate more than 300 sets of furniture. The work part is divided into the sawmilling department, the installation department, the carving department, the white body department, the Chinese lacquer department, the foreign paint department, the tailoring department, and the insulation department. The insulation department is particularly unique. Chinese lacquer requires a constant temperature to achieve fine workmanship, and this type of equipment is rare in other furniture stores. As for accessories, such as springs and glass, they are directly ordered from various countries without any borrowing. The various room furniture styles strive for artistic modernization. Specially hired technicians design them, which is praised by all sectors. Introduction of Domestically Produced Electroplating Raw Materials. China has always produced a large quantity of copper and tin utensils. Since the invention of polishing and electroplating, the application of copper utensils has become more widespread. Some are specially polished without electroplating, such as steel signs, copper railings, copper beds, and all kinds of copper, tin, steel, and fine utensils. Others are polished and then nickel-plated, such as flashlights, thermos bottles, and various supplies such as wheels and clocks. As society progresses, the polishing and plating industry becomes more developed. Unfortunately, the raw materials required are all imported, so a huge amount of money is leaked every year. The China North Factory in this city previously produced and sold Shuangjian brand copper polishing oil, which was indeed cheap and of good quality, and was able to sell well throughout the country. The Japanese goods, such as Nissan Brand, etc., which had been on the market have now disappeared. This is also a practical anti-Japanese work. It is heard that the China Factory is not satisfied with this and continues to research diligently. Recently, it has also produced a nickel polishing white oil, the effect of which is the same as the best American goods. A large batch will be shipped next month. Dealers in various ports are very welcome to sign contracts for distribution. The factory's office is located next to the Shen Bao Newspaper Office on Hankou Road.</p>
<p>Recent News from the Renji Hotel in Hongkou. The Renji Hotel in Hongkou, North Sichuan Road, has been closed since the January 28th Incident. Merchants and travelers felt very inconvenienced.

The scale is larger than before, with well-equipped facilities such as dance halls, restaurants, and barber shops. The prices are exceptionally low. It is currently being renovated and will open for business as soon as the work is completed. The interior is exquisitely furnished and the service is attentive. Ou Jun has extensive experience in the hotel industry and will be praised by all sectors at that time.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>To the Esteemed Editor of Shen Bao,</p>
<p>Regarding the report in your newspaper yesterday about the sale of land by Jing'an Temple to support the military, there is a slight error. The land of our temple absolutely cannot be sold. It is only that the land on the left and right sides of the mountain gate was leased to Samsung Company (not Fulushou Company). This company is also enthusiastic about patriotism, so last month they advanced 5,000 yuan in rent to support the Northeast Volunteer Army. There is no other amount, and Zhiba has no involvement whatsoever. Please correct this quickly to avoid misunderstandings from the outside world. I am deeply grateful.</p>
<p>Respectfully,</p>
<p>Zhiba, Abbot of Jing'an Temple</p>
<p>February 25th</p>
<p>Correction - Regarding the news in yesterday's paper about the Second Special District Court's hearing of Lin Yayue's accusation against Guo Weiyi for obscenity, there was a section stating ["Audience Prohibited," "Newspaper Reporters Allowed to Attend Due to Special Treatment"].

<h3>Standards for Civic Training in Elementary Schools (4)</h3>
<p>5.  Key Points of Implementation Plan</p>
<p>I. Civic training should be implemented in two aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Public training</p>
<p>(a) During teaching time for each subject, teachers should indirectly guide children or directly explain based on the outline items.</p>
<p>(b) At any time and place, teachers should pay attention to various activities of children, directly and indirectly cite regulations and various items, and guide children to abide by them.</p>
<p>(c) In a certain period, according to the public needs of children or when public shortcomings of children are discovered, select appropriate virtues as the center of training and use various methods for public training, lasting from one to two weeks.</p>
<p>(d) Every week, on Memorial Week, the entire school should read aloud or compose the meaning of the words into songs to sing. Each week, an appropriate virtue can also be selected for special emphasis and used as public training, but it should not be reduced to shouting slogans or posting slogans.</p>
<p>(e) During the sixty-minute specific time each week, divide the sixty minutes into three times, teaching every other day, or divide it into six times, guiding daily. During each specific time, the teacher should cite items based on occasional events and explain them. If a training week is held, emphasis should be placed on items related to the central virtue.</p>
<p>(2) Individual training can be divided into several groups or several teams, depending on the number of teachers and students in the school. Each teacher is responsible for the individual training of one group or one team, supervising them to practice the items in various ways, conducting self-examination, and paying attention to examining the results.</p>
<p>II. Each school should set up a civic training committee to jointly discuss and determine the organizational system and specific methods of civic training. All teachers must participate.</p>
<p>III. At the beginning of each semester, each school should divide the training items into stages and make small booklets or loose-leaf pages, which should be distributed to children by groups or teams so that children understand the matters that should be paid attention to in this semester and have the opportunity to reflect.</p>
<p>IV. The training items of each stage should be arranged in order by each school and divided into four small stages, evenly distributed to children in each grade for training for the four semesters.</p>
<p>V. Training items that each child can do should continue to be trained and examined later.</p>
<p>VI. Local competent educational administrative authorities may guide each school to appropriately increase or decrease stages or change them according to the actual needs of the training items.</p>
<p>VII. Teachers in each school should take the opportunity to jointly formulate items with children and discuss methods to achieve various items based on this standard using suggestive methods to avoid coercive methods.</p>
<p>VIII. In addition to teachers' usual observation and recording, each group or team should regularly conduct examinations weekly or monthly, make children reflect on or jointly criticize the training items, and use competitions and honorary awards to improve the efficiency of training.</p>
<p>IX. The results of the civic training examination should be compiled into children's reflection record forms, teacher observation record forms, a comparison table for each group or team, and reports to parents, so that teachers, students, and parents can clearly understand the results of civic training.</p>
<p>X. Civic training emphasizes practice and does not use textbooks.</p>
<p>XI. Civic training pays attention to personality influence, and teachers must set an example.</p>
<p>XII. The school environment should be appropriately arranged and equipped according to Chinese civic regulations, such as equipment that meets health principles, so that children can receive good environmental training unconsciously. XIII. Civic training should use more positive activities to subtly influence children and develop various good habits. Avoid using negative methods of suppression to create a hypocritical attitude where children are afraid to do something. XIV. Individual training is more important than public training. Therefore, the personality, ability, physical strength, family situation, and social environment of children related to civic training must be carefully examined and investigated. XV. Civic training must be linked to the family, so that parents report the characteristics of their children to the school, and the school regularly reports the examination results to parents to seek mutual cooperation.</p>
<p>XVI. Group organizations can provide training, such as self-government organizations and other group activities such as academics, health, art, and communication. Sufficient training opportunities should be given at any time.</p>
<p>XVII. Children in each grade should be allowed to participate in social activities at any time to help the progress of social undertakings, such as conducting fly eradication campaigns and household surveys.</p>
<p>XVIII. Higher grades should train children to investigate and judge the advantages and disadvantages of various undertakings in their own organizations and social environment and plan how to improve them. (End)</p>

<h3>Establishment of Curriculum Compilation Committee for Kindergartens and Elementary Schools in This City</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has officially promulgated the new curriculum standards for kindergartens and elementary schools. Recently, it also designated provinces such as Jiangsu and Zhejiang and cities such as Shanghai to organize curriculum compilation committees in accordance with Item 4 of the Implementation Measures for Curriculum Standards. It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau has separately appointed educational experts, bureau staff, and teachers specializing in various subjects in elementary schools in this city to form the Kindergarten and Elementary School Curriculum Compilation Committee and has formulated rules and submitted them to the Municipal Government and the Ministry of Education for record.

<h3>Special Article: Several Hopes for Education in Zhejiang Province</h3>
<p>I have several opinions and wishes for the education sector in Zhejiang Province and all parties related to education. At the beginning of this year, 1933, I will briefly state them.</p>
<p>1.  I hope that those who serve education in this province will work hard at all times, be thrifty, invigorate themselves every day, and be excited to put into practice the wish of saving the country through education. You must know that a few hours of idle leisure and the waste of a piece of paper or a pen are incalculable losses in the midst of serious national crises.</p>
<p>2.  I hope that educators will recognize the national situation of our country and truly recognize that our responsibility is not only to create individuals, but to create the citizens needed for the survival of our country. Anyone who only takes a formal acknowledgment of the purpose of education in the Republic of China and its implementation guidelines and cannot truly fulfill them can only be regarded as occasionally serving education, not the educator needed by the country.</p>
<p>III. I hope that the teachers and staff of middle and primary schools in this province will pay close attention to the students' studies and not make it seem on the surface that everything is available, decorated in colorful ways, while many parents frown when examining their children's studies and sigh, "It's not as good as it used to be." The low level of general students (even if not all) is, whatever the reason, a reality that cannot be avoided. Therefore, I sincerely hope that everyone will not talk about lofty ideals and show off new things, but based on true facts, present the facts that the students' studies can be explained.</p>
<p>IV. I hope that those who preside over mass education in this province will not just resent the indifference of society to mass education, the difficulty of funding, and the difficulty of progress. I believe that each county should not regard mass education as an order to be followed or as a decoration to be seen. Our mass education centers in each county should focus on one or several activities and work hard to attract everyone's attention. In places where education is backward, you must not give up on yourself and become a useless organization that only hangs a sign. In places with better economic and talent resources, you must not be greedy for too much and become too broad, which will result in the inability to produce a real result. You must not take means as the purpose, only to make it a place for public entertainment, but without any educational significance.</p>
<p>V. I hope that the county magistrates of each county will have more enthusiasm and concern for education. The development and prosperity of a county and the progress of various county policies are closely related to the rise and fall of education. Therefore, the leadership of the county's overall education plan and the promotion of education and learning are the responsibilities that enlightened county magistrates should take upon themselves.</p>
<p>VI. I hope that the directors of the Education Bureau in each county will be diligent and alert and seek the consolidation and development of local education amidst thousands of hardships. First, their own behavior must be strictly checked. Second, their attitude towards people must not be too frivolous, and the handling of affairs must not be too careless. Third, they must be able to endure grievances, withstand pressure, work hard and complain little, and be organized and methodical.</p>
<p>L. I hope that the parents of our Zhejiang students will no longer fail to pay attention to their children's character and studies, and no longer fail to plan their children's future in advance. Many young students who have parents who urge and teach them at any time will always achieve better results than those who do not have parents to discipline them. As for the issue of children's further education, it is especially a problem that should be seriously considered but is ignored by most parents. I think this is a big reason for the lack of direction of many young people. I believe that each parent should send their children to ordinary junior high schools without consideration, planning, or preparation when their children graduate from elementary school is not necessarily a way to love their children. At the time of graduation from junior high school, because there was no overall plan, it was the same haste and no consideration and preparation to send them to ordinary high school, thinking that they would let them pass four years and then say that this is especially likely to harm children. Because if the family cannot afford the tuition fees, then the result will inevitably be tragic, either the children and the family are not in harmony, or the children are forced to drop out of school due to family pressure and cannot find a suitable job. Because the number of people in Zhejiang who go to school is not small, I personally feel that this meaning is even more profound. I believe that each parent should carefully consider and plan the further education and employment of their children in advance. If the family's supply and the children's personality are suitable up to a certain stage, resolutely decide to let him drop out of school or change to various vocational and aesthetic training institutions for employment preparation, which is the parents' best way to love their children.</p>
<p>VIII. I hope that our Zhejiang elders and brothers will restore the spirit of the early schools more than 20 years ago to promote education in each county throughout our province. In the situation where the provincial funds are so difficult and the rural economy in each county is showing signs of collapse, what we should do, such as running vocational schools at all levels, promoting compulsory education, adding mass schools... etc., are all imminent and require considerable funding. We now have nothing else that can overcome difficulties, but to raise a heart of enthusiasm and solve the problems in education. If people in each county, each district, and each township do not rise up together to plan, and elders and brothers throughout the province help as much as possible, then the education and culture of Zhejiang will inevitably not progress. In order to seek the happiness of the compatriots in this province, we cannot but sincerely ask for the cooperation of the people in Zhejiang.</p>

<h3>Municipal Education Bureau to Hold Wireless Broadcasting Tutoring Classes</h3>
<p>| Subjects temporarily include Civics, Mandarin, and English |</p>
<p>Starts March 1st, 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM Every Night</p>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau has been paying more attention to the active promotion of social education in the past six months. Recently, it is planning to use radio stations to hold wireless broadcasting tutoring classes so that generally older unemployed or semi-literate workers and apprentices can obtain the opportunity for remedial education. Leisure time will not be wasted, and the law is good and meaningful, which is really groundbreaking. It is learned that the radio tutoring class will start broadcasting programs from 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM every night from March 1 at the Hengsen Radio Station on Nanjing Road, divided into two subjects: [Civics] [Mandarin] [English]. The Bureau has consulted with the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and instructed various factories and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations to inform various shops and companies and quickly equip them with radios and announce to workers and apprentices to abide by and register for learning. All those who wish to learn can directly register with the Municipal Education Bureau.</p>

<h3>International Education Society's Annual Meeting to Be Held at the End of March</h3>
<p>Visited William School Yesterday</p>
<p>1.  The president of the Shanghai International Education Society, Mr. Kang _, has retired and returned to his country. All society affairs are temporarily handled by Mr. Li Zhaohuan, president of Jiaotong University. Yesterday afternoon, Acting President Li led more than 100 members of the society to visit the German William School on Xihui Road. Dr. Weber, Dr. Lanhua, and Dr. Kirk, principals of the school, led the visitors to tour the entire building and student-made specimens and artistic instruments. The achievements were quite remarkable. After the tour, they gathered in the school hall. Dr. Lan gave a speech, first describing the school's operation and student overview, and then lecturing on the German education system. He stated that the German school organization is different from the British one. In British schools, students' reading, games, and other activities are confined to the school, and they live with their student companions. In Germany, in addition to school education, most attention is paid to family education. Therefore, British students are less mentally stable than German students, and their development is also very different. The German education community is currently engaged in planning to produce ideal individuals. Although Germans have continental thinking, they have a very noble significance in education. After Dr. Lan's speech, the school students performed a drama, which was quite moving. Then, Acting President Li gave a thank-you speech. Finally, Mr. Baituolai, Secretary-General of the Society, reported that the annual meeting will be held at the end of March, and they also plan to visit the YMCA Middle School on Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Gongshi Middle School Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Gongshi Middle School officially started classes yesterday and held an opening ceremony at 8:00 AM. Attendees included Principal Cai Guojingya, as well as Guo Yicen, Li Shicen, Zhang Yaoxiang, Liu Bingli, Zhang Haishu, Zhang Liyuan, Sun Boshen, He Jia, Pan Yufeng, Luo Zhongqin, and all the students. After the ceremony, the principal, school board members, and faculty members delivered speeches respectively, reporting on the reform process and future plans, such as focusing on practical knowledge in teaching and setting up special lectures on international economics and politics. In terms of discipline, the focus will be on group-based discipline. Afterwards, a photo was taken and the event concluded.</p>
<h3>Public Works Bureau Builds New Jingzhou Road Primary School</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau has already established four primary schools for Chinese children, namely the West District Primary School on Xinzha Road, the North District Primary School on Arerjin Road, the East District Primary School on Huishan Road, and the Huade Road Primary School on Huade Road. Recently, another new primary school has been built at the corner of Huishan Road and Jingzhou Road. The school building faces south and is a three-story building with steel and concrete beams and columns, and red brick exterior walls. It is more than two hundred feet long. The south side of the building has three floors of classrooms, a total of sixteen rooms, which can accommodate 650 students. The north side of the building is a large auditorium that can accommodate 400 seats. There is a stage and equipment for projecting movies. The north wall of the auditorium is equipped with new-style movable glass windows, and outside of that, there are roll-up and roll-down blinds, all of which can be opened and closed from below with ropes, making them extremely flexible. On the east and west sides of the building, there are student cloakrooms, drinking fountains, restrooms, and classrooms. In addition, there are kindergarten rooms, science labs, art rooms, equipment rooms, kitchens, storage rooms, etc. The principal's office and the teachers' lounges for both men and women are all on the second floor. All the rooms in the building have good lighting and ventilation and are equipped with steam radiators. The school is located south of Nie Zhongcheng Public School. The area between the two schools is a common sports field, with a considerable area. The north of the field is separated by a fence, with a gate on the east and west sides. There is still extra space north of the fence, several feet wide, to be used as a primary school lawn. Swings and other play equipment will be installed on the east side of the building. The school is scheduled to open on March 1. Except for kindergarten students and first-graders, only male students will be admitted. Those who wish to send their children to study can contact Principal Jie Zhi of the Public Works Bureau's Huade Road Primary School at No. 138 Huade Road.

<h3>Badminton Match</h3>
<h3>Lin Baohua Loses in Singles Yesterday</h3>
<p>15 to 0, 15 to 5</p>
<p>Sullivan Wins Right to Replay</p>
<p>In the Shanghai Badminton Championship, the Lin-Qiu pair was eliminated in the first week. Hope was placed on Lin Baohua's singles, but he also lost yesterday. Sullivan won the right to replay with a score of 2-0. The match was held at the bright and magnificent French Chamber of Commerce court. Lin Baohua lost two games in a row, 15-0, 15-5, and was completely outmatched. After Lin completely collapsed in the first game, he hoped to recover in the second game, but after showing some improvement, he failed again. Lin has not been practicing for long, while Sullivan is a veteran from Hong Kong, so the difference in skill was naturally huge. From now on, Chinese players will no longer be able to compete for the badminton championship. It is hoped that more players will emerge next spring.</p>
<h3>Western Youth Volleyball Match: China Youth Defeats Jiangwan Again</h3>
<p>44 to 28</p>
<p>Mai Ling Suddenly Lost to Western Youth</p>

In the third game, Jiangwan worked hard to compete, and China Youth was one point behind, 14-15. Now, the only team left for China Youth is Mai Ling's team. Mai Ling suddenly lost to Western Youth with a score of 27-41 yesterday.</p>
<h3>Donghua Wins Big Against Lancashire 6-0</h3>
<p>Creates a Record of Sixteen Clean Sheets in Division A</p>
<p>Remaining Two Matches Don't Jeopardize Championship</p>
<p>In the Western League Division A, Donghua, with its strong strength and prestigious reputation for a hundred victories, arrived at Yiyuan yesterday and unanimously defeated Lancashire 6-0, creating a record of sixteen clean sheets. According to the schedule, with two more matches each against the Fourth Platoon and the British Army, the Division A championship is already in hand. The point of future effort is to maintain the great record of a hundred victories.</p>
<h3>Donghua Team's Victory Was Very Easy</h3>
<p>The Donghua team gave a full-team performance yesterday, but it was not perfect. However, compared to Lancashire, there was a world of difference. They took a casual and underestimating approach; otherwise, there might have been a better record. Zhou Xianyan was as steady as ever and can be called the number one player in Shanghai. Li Ning's leg injury has not healed, so he was much less impressive. Guan Xun'an has made great progress and has a limitless future. The center back line of Feng Yunyou, Wu Youliang, and Tu Kaiyuan was united as one, and their offense and defense were both excellent. Chen Xutian has been quite impressive recently. Wan Xianghua did not have many highlights yesterday. Chen Jiaqiu was average. Li Yichen worked hard, and Cao Qiuting was full of courage. Although it was difficult to be perfect, he felt worthy of his position. One successful kick opened the individual scoring record for this season, so he deserved to be full of smiles.</p>
<h3>Lancashire Fought Hard and Failed</h3>
<p>Lancashire is not a first-class team, and its fighting strength is indeed ordinary. It just happened that Donghua was in a relaxed mood, so they were able to compete with them. The center back line fought very hard, and the forwards also entered whenever there was an opening. However, the former lacked passing skills, and the latter lacked shooting power. Although there were occasional fierce attacks, they ultimately had no effect. The inside back was not positioned properly and lacked skills. The defense was just for show and had no practical effect. Whenever there was a crisis, they were flustered and panicked. If Donghua had given it their all, the loss would certainly not have been this great.</p>
<h3>Four Goals Flowed Into the Net</h3>
<p>Less than ten minutes into the battle, Tu Kaiyuan kicked a free kick towards the goal. The goalkeeper caught it but looked up and saw the opponent rushing in. He turned around and kicked it back in a hurry, causing everyone to laugh. Then, left and right corners. Soon after, Wu Youliang also took the ball and attacked. Li Yichen followed closely, and both he and the goalkeeper fell to the ground. The ball returned to Chen Jiaqiu's side. Chen calmly kicked it in. However, Li was still lying on the ground and had not gotten up, so the goal was ruled out because of offside. After another fifty-five minutes, the right inside back, Shi Wen, touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick. Li Yichen kicked with his right foot, and the ball went into the net. Once the record was opened, the goals flowed in one after another. Li suddenly displayed the vigor of a dragon and tiger, broke into the enemy territory alone, and scored again within a few minutes. Cao Qiuting scored with a preemptive strike. Chen Yutian circled and advanced, taking advantage of the enemy's unpreparedness and shooting hard, hitting the right corner. After three goals, Cao also became ambitious, and like a lone army, he succeeded in winning the flag. The first half ended with four goals to zero.</p>
<h3>Triumph After Repeatedly Breaching the Enemy's Fortress</h3>
<p>In the second half, the enemy took advantage of the wind and attacked fiercely. Within twenty minutes, the enemy's momentum was high. Donghua's three counterattacks were unsuccessful and they retreated. At that time, although the enemy's offensive was strong, it was ultimately contained outside the inner defense line and could not enter the gate. After a long time, Feng Yunyou raised his arm and stole the ball out of bounds, handing it over to the front. Li Yichen received the order and dribbled the ball straight into the goal. Tu Kaiyuan double kicked the ball in front of the goal and was penalized with a free kick. Both sides lined up in front of the goal, facing each other. The tense situation was filled with comical fun. After the ball left the foot, both sides fought for it. Finally, Tu saved it, redeeming himself. Not long after, Wan Xianghua sent troops to the left flank, entering the battle alone and returning with merit. As a result, Donghua won the game 6-0. The referee was Pike.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Preparations That the Public Should Make Before the War</h3>
<p>— Pei Gong</p>
<p>丨Broadsword and Gas Mask丨</p>
<p>A few months ago, a scholar in England published a very insightful statement in the Manchester Guardian, titled: [Prepare for the Worst-Case Scenario]; the idea is that the Second World War will break out soon, and the world should have considerable awareness and preparation. Even the British have such thoughts. We Chinese, who are at the forefront, how exactly do we intend to deal with and prepare for the disaster that may occur immediately?</p>
<p>Speaking of preparation, according to my impatience, everyone can only prepare to fight desperately. Indeed, fighting desperately is the most active preparation. However, if people are unwilling to fight desperately, and cannot force the government to temporarily protect you from fighting desperately, and cannot resist, then, as a last resort, let's first make some preparations to save our own lives!</p>
<p>Friends, please believe me, after the war becomes more intense, the Japanese, who use killing as national education, will inevitably use [poison gas]. Therefore, we should ask scientists, doctors, and pharmacies to quickly unite to manufacture more gas masks for everyone to purchase. Secondly, to say something unlucky, perhaps in the early stages of the war, coastal areas may be trampled by the enemy, and the people may have the opportunity to fight the enemy directly. Then, preparing a broadsword and sharpening it diligently is also the least amount of preparation!</p>
<p>Friends, everyone should recognize that this war is a matter of life and death for us Chinese. It is better to advance and die than to retreat and die! What are we afraid of! The enemy wants us to die, and we must also teach them to die!</p>
<h3>Eastern Mirror</h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>| Exposed |</p>
<p>The threshold of a matter has already become clear; the darkness of a matter has already been unveiled; this is called [Exposing the Eastern Mirror]. Generally, Chinese people have simple minds and dull eyes. When they see the tricks of foreigners, they find them incredibly strange, like microscopes and telescopes, and are amazed by them as if they were the work of gods and demons. There are also some Jianghu (江湖, itinerant entertainers) friends who set up a box on the streets and in villages, using convex lenses to magnify the pictures inside, attracting children from the streets to gather and watch. The scenery, dramas, wars, and colorful scenes captivate the audience. Finally, there are also mysterious, fleeting glimpses of erotic pictures, which especially make the audience's minds wander. Therefore, this kind of Eastern Mirror still exists everywhere today, becoming a profession for Jianghu friends. In fact, the scenery is photography; the dramas are paper paintings; as for the "Spring in the Han Palace", everyone has their own good performances. So, to expose it, this kind of Eastern Mirror has no viewing value at all.</p>
<p>All things in the world should be viewed in this way: for example, women, with their myriad charms, who dares to have frivolous thoughts? But modern young ladies may be used to being embraced by men on the dance floor; the concubines in mansions and the "vases" in counters may be the backbone of the human flesh market. Therefore, once the Eastern Mirror is exposed, their worth is no longer noble. The great figures in political, academic, and business circles are the same; seen from afar, they are truly awe-inspiring, with imposing airs and full of airs, who doesn't lose courage upon seeing them? In fact, once the Eastern Mirror is exposed, they not only turn into paper tigers, but may even be worse than dogs and horses, truly making people laugh their teeth off.</p>
<p>The Eastern Japanese country was originally one of the world's five major powers; annexing Korea, swallowing Taiwan, ceding Ryukyu, and defeating strong Russia. Their playing of the Eastern Mirror was truly lively, playing one after another, never playing a tragedy. Since the September 18th Incident, they seized Fanyang without leaving a single arrow, and later completely swallowed Manchuria. Fearing that the audience in the world would have a negative reaction, they played a puppet show in the Eastern Mirror. Now that the Eastern Mirror has been completely exposed, the audience in the world is rising up to boo, but it shamelessly continues. Since the Songhu Battle, we Chinese have taken the lead in the first 回敎 (Muslim?) one, and the Eastern Mirror they played has long been exposed; after changing several commanders, they still cannot defeat our 19th Route Army. Moreover, on the bodies of the captured soldiers, they found talismans with [Taishang Laojun, hurry, hurry, as the law commands, decree!], as well as diaries fearing war and death. Isn't this exposing the Eastern Mirror? We Chinese have always only known how to expose Western Mirrors; now, let's all rise up and [Expose the Eastern Mirror]!</p>
<h3>New Spring Outfits</h3>

<h3>Street Artists</h3>
<p>— Huo Xueming</p>
<p>| Clay Figurine Makers |</p>
<p>Under low eaves, in narrow alleys with small painted walls, or in quiet areas of factories: we can find street artists.</p>
<p>Don't think that only the poets, musicians, painters, architects, and all the great talents serving the court are worthy of being called artists. In this era, the old die and the new are born. The breath of the laborers of Wall Street is music, the conversation of blacksmiths is poetry, and those who can create imagist paintings are worthy of being called painters. Of course, the title of architect should not be monopolized by the drafters alone, but every carpenter and mason who participates in the construction of a house is an architect. Because artists should indeed use their brains, but they must also use their strength at the same time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, you must also know that so-called works of art are not just poems, songs, paintings, dramas, architecture, etc. To find works of art with modern light, one should have this kind of understanding. Let me introduce you to street artists:</p>
<p>Isn't that right? An old Jiangbei man wearing a blue cloth village outfit, with a long beard and hair, looks a bit like Tolstoy: he also doesn't brush his teeth, and his clothes are covered with snot and dirt, and also looks like [unruly] Wang Anshi or modern national scholar Zhang Taiyan; he is definitely not a lazy person. He spends his life faithfully cultivating his confident skills. Starting from the morning, he leaves his poor home, carrying a pole, and embarks on the journey of art. Where there are many children, he puts down his pole.</p>
<p>An artist especially sings and praises the pure innocence of children. Everyone's life is most comfortable and peaceful only when listening to their mother's lullaby in the cradle. And so it is with street artists. He smiles when he sits in front of the children. He opens his pole, takes out flour or sugar, and with his hands, he creates green parrots, red-faced Guan Yu, and statues of Indians with red cloth wrapped around their heads. If you ask him to make a tumbler or a swordsman or a martial woman, they are all lifelike. Although these skilled works also have their ups and downs, they have inevitably inconsistent achievements just like literary works and musical scores that are created by each writer. We cannot say that these flour or sugar models are not works of art because of inherited contemporary concepts, just as we cannot deny that Greek and Italian sculptures and famous European shadow figures (Shadow Figure) are works of art. For the same reason, and to express the lively symbols of modern radical social life, it is not the beauty of classicism, but the beauty of rough power. Facing the paintings of the modern German Fauvist school and the Futurist literary movement, I am even more convinced of my theory.</p>
<p>These street artists sell their works cheaply to children, and their treatment in China is just like that of literati selling their manuscripts, living a miserable life.</p>

<h3>The Landlord</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>[Good]! The landlord jumped up like a fierce tiger, his eyes as big as copper bells. [Elder brother, second brother,... you take thirty people to resist for a while!] He pointed the tip of his knife at the people who were called, and they immediately started walking. Behind them, six pure yellow fierce dogs roared like tigers, their tails like iron rods, vying to follow their masters and bravely rush to the enemy.</p>
<p>The sound of people and dogs running immediately stirred up a tense atmosphere.</p>
<p>[Fifth brother, Xiaoling, Xiaohe, hurry up and prepare bows and arrows!] The landlord also dispatched the second batch of soldiers and generals; this was to prepare for the worst, in case the front line could not hold and had to retreat to defend the village. The landlord had two good horses, which he personally brought back from the north in his middle age; in the previous two [wars against the Japanese pirates], they had also made great contributions of blood and sweat. At this time, two long-term workers had already led them to the square. The horses also seemed to understand their master's intentions, knowing that they were about to go into battle, and they all raised their manes and neighed loudly.</p>
<p>Because they had already undergone two training sessions, every long-term worker in the landlord's family had a heart as big as a bucket. The second batch of reinforcements did not need the landlord's deployment, and had already rushed out with the third brother.</p>
<p>The third brother was the most valiant of the landlord's seven sons. He had once used a horse and a spear to repel three hundred Japanese pirates; and once, he was shot in the forehead by a Japanese pirate's arrow, and the blood dyed his pale yellow face a deep red. He still fought bravely and did not retreat. In the end, he forcefully pulled out the arrow and reflected it back, using it to shoot and kill a Japanese pirate captain.</p>
<p>[Landlord! The Japanese pirates are strong, they can't resist them, half of the thirty people are already dead!]</p>
<p>Just as the landlord was about to mount his horse and prepare to personally meet the enemy, the second alarm came. [Where have the Japanese pirates reached?] The old man calmly took off his coat and inserted a short sword diagonally on his back.</p>
<p>[They are about to enter the village!] An unexpected report. (Four)</p>

<h3>Sitting Postures and Psychological Speculation</h3>
<p>— Wanzhen</p>
<p>I was sitting opposite Zhang Xiaozu, and I said to her: "I don't know why you are so absent-minded."</p>
<p>"I'm very worried, but:" she said, looking at me, and then asked.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by what you said?"</p>
<p>I told her: "I was paying attention to your sitting posture." I knew she would definitely want to understand, so I continued to briefly tell her:</p>
<p>I can guess your thoughts from the posture of your legs when you sit. For example! If you sit with your legs apart, but your toes are turned inwards, as in the first picture, it means you are very bored, either you are daydreaming, or you are definitely absent-minded.</p>
<p>Sitting like this, the legs are definitely not arranged very neatly, and not just any sitting will result in this posture. Just pay attention and when that person sits like this, you can ask her, and let her say whether this is the case. (She might jump up after hearing this).</p>
<p>Many people sit with their legs very close together. Like the second picture, this posture seems too heavy. At that time, that person's mind must be very clear, and their thinking is also quick; at that time, they must be very disciplined, and seem to be sitting upright with an inviolable air.</p>
<p>Many people sit with their legs one in front of the other, as in the third picture. This posture seems to be deep in thought, or it implies the leisurely attitude of a poet.</p>
<p>Some people lean back on the chair, half-lying and half-sitting, with one leg over the other, as in the fourth picture. This person's posture seems too casual.</p>
<p>Of course, it cannot be said that everyone is like this, this is just speculation based on the postures of most people.</p>

<h3>The So-called [Explanation]</h3>
<p>— Li Shui</p>
<p>I am not afraid of great figures killing people at will, I am only afraid of great figures coming up with an [explanation] after killing someone! A tiger eats a sheep, and that's the end of it; but people, after eating people, have to make themselves out to be benevolent and righteous, and describe the person being eaten as utterly evil, never to be restored. This is truly terrifying.</p>
<p>Humans, not just Chinese people, all have a bit of a mentality of worshiping great figures. The weak can say ten or a hundred times without attracting attention; a great figure only needs to fart, and it will cause a stir. For example, in ancient times, if the emperor did something wrong, wrongly killed someone, if the emperor himself did not think it was wrong, naturally everyone would have nothing to say; if he said he had done something wrong and expressed remorse, then those ministers and scholars would immediately sing praises to the emperor's sagacity, giving it their all. As for the wrongly done thing and the wrongly killed person, it would naturally be right to be wrong, and there would be nothing more to say. However, this is only something that the emperor can do. If it is a great figure of the second rank, then they must [explain]!</p>
<p>The methods of [explanation] are various: doing a good job of covering up, burying incriminating evidence, and directly announcing the [truth] (?) of why the person was killed in order to gain the understanding of the people of the world, one way; calling a deer a horse, reversing black and white, making the world's eyes dazzled and unable to distinguish right from wrong, a second way; if the situation is dangerous, such as in the modern era with a strong flavor of democracy, where the actions of great figures are often criticized by young people who do not understand affairs, great figures, in order to evade those vicious gazes, can [explain] to even greater great figures, and then have the [great great figures] come out to [explain] to the people, a third way.</p>
<p>The Japanese occupation of the Northeast is already enough to break our hearts; but when we hear the Japanese in the League of Nations speaking of their benevolent and righteous [explanation] of [developing the rich resources of the Northeast for the Chinese people] [driving away the warlords and eliminating internal strife for the Chinese people!], doesn't it make us feel even more heartbroken?</p>
<p>XXXXXXX, after shooting XXXX, was subjected to condemnation by pens. It is reported that on X month X day, he has already [explained] to the XXXX great great figure. I am really worried about how that great great figure will [explain] to the people on behalf of that Chairman, I think it will be: [The official is wise, the slave deserves it]!</p>
<p>Alas, the dead are gone, what about the living? [A good head, who will chop it off?] I hope everyone will feel their own necks!</p>
<h3>Twilight Jottings</h3>
<p>— Qian Gechuan</p>
<p>We work for others for a day, and at the time when day and night intersect, we lazily run home wanting to sleep but not sleeping, and instead pick up a cigarette. Cigarettes are exciting, everyone knows that. In the twilight, leaning on the railing and blowing a couple of puffs of smoke, even I, who am not a poet, feel the loveliness of this leisure time. Raising my head, I see the vast sky, and lowering my head, I see the shadowy figures of people. All fantasies are built up from this half-light. I then want to take advantage of this time of all things to think as much as possible, to think of all the things that I could not get during the day. However, before I could see that happiest of lives, it was already broken by the lamp of reason. My current situation has no happiness, only one human head after another, sparsely walking by. In my ears, it seems as if there is a voice ringing: [Don't fantasize! Fantasizing is suffering for yourself!] At this time, I am completely awake. Wherever my eyes reach, there is a Western-style head of a man without a hat. His hair is like a newly cut piece of black satin, so smooth that it can be used as a mirror. I suddenly realize that everyone else is wearing a hat, but he alone is not wearing one, he must not want to hide the beauty of his hair. Chinese women don't wear hats either, probably for the same reason. Western-style heads are all parted on the left, supposedly starting from Napoleon. Because Napoleon had a scar on his right skull, he combed his hair from the left to cover it. The world did not know the inside story, and all said that it looked good combed this way, so it became the standard of beauty.</p>
<p>Going downstairs and strolling on the street, as soon as I go out, I see some wild chickens expressing their love to the men passing by. This is a live drama that happens every evening in Shanghai. I don't want to watch it, and continue to walk forward. A rickshaw came shouting from behind, with a very wealthy woman sitting on it. It walked in front of me, less than thirty feet away, when suddenly, with an "aiya" sound, the rickshaw puller stepped on a banana peel and fell to the ground, and the wealthy woman also tumbled off the rickshaw, her silk cheongsam torn. The woman lay on the ground, scolded the rickshaw puller a few words, and then suddenly began to cry loudly. The passersby all gathered around, and I also joined in to watch the excitement. I only heard the woman crying and complaining. At first, she wanted the rickshaw puller to compensate her for the clothes. Later, knowing that the rickshaw puller couldn't afford to pay, she could only blame heaven: [Heaven! Why did you have to tear my going-out clothes? What will I wear to the factory tomorrow? I worked for three years to make this one piece of clothing, and I don't have a penny now!] Those people on the road who were wearing gorgeous clothes all sighed in unison. Only a middle-aged woman wearing cloth clothes, without saying a word, generously took out a five-yuan banknote from her pocket and handed it to her, saying: [Take this and make a piece of cloth clothing] to wear.</p>
<p>The audience dispersed, and I still walked forward. In the distance, I saw a store, with bright electric lights. Walking closer, I realized that it was W·C Bookstore. Because its business was thriving, it had just moved to a larger store and was selling at special prices. Stores go from big to small, and book prices go from expensive to cheap. The facts before my eyes show us that they have made money no matter what. But I always feel a little strange in my heart, thinking: Is what Mr. Xu said last night false? He clearly said that W·C Bookstore lost tens of thousands of dollars and is about to close down now. To make money, they have to sell at large discounts, which may be a commercial tactic of small profits but quick turnover; but to move to a big store when they are about to close down, this I can't understand no matter what!</p>
<h3>In the Tram</h3>
<p>— Yuru</p>
<p>It was a clear and peaceful early spring evening, and the setting sun weakly reflected on the sidewalk on the left side of Diksui Road. I came out of the YWCA, dragging my long, thin shadow toward the tram stop on North Sichuan Road. I was planning to take the tram to the Hai Ge Road Sanatorium to visit a friend. After waiting for a long time, I finally jumped onto a tram with an unexpectedly crowded number of passengers. In the car, besides myself and a short and very fat lady with a strong Cantonese accent, there were only men. Because it was in a third-class car, and it was so crowded, there was naturally no hope of a seat, so I stood on the platform outside the car without wanting to go inside. When the car arrived at Bazilu, several people wanted to get off, and the ticket seller asked me to squeeze in, so I squeezed in. Order was greatly disrupted, and the men who were standing all turned their heads to stare at you without hesitation. Although a lot of people got off, it seemed that not a few people got on either. Your body was still under severe pressure. I don't know where that fat lady was squeezed to.</p>
<p>"Let you sit!" Suddenly a hand landed on my arm. It was a young man in a suit sitting next to the price list.</p>
<p>"Thank you!" I sat down without hesitation. He then stood in front of me. Knees against knees, often rubbing uncomfortably due to the swaying of the car, which made people very uncomfortable, but what could I do? He let me sit down. Gradually, this very frequent contact became constant, and then he simply fixed you in place and didn't move, and then sandwiched your knees between his hard legs, so that you couldn't move at all.</p>
<p>"It's really crowded!" I pulled my leg out and said angrily.</p>
<p>"That's right, it's really annoying, so many people!" He widened the gap a little.</p>
<p>The car slid down from the Waibaidu Bridge, and many boats were crowded on the Suzhou River.</p>
<p>At one point, I thought of a small book in my pocket, so I took it out and looked at it, flipping through the illustrations one by one. Finally, when I saw the "Autumn on the Edogawa River" by the painter Fujita, a foreign sentiment floated vaguely in my heart. Suddenly, the fingers of the hand holding the book received a strange sensation, as if they had been electrocuted, and I quickly retracted them. "You can sit, please! Annoying!" I stood up abruptly in the crowd with glaring eyes, and my face turned hot. The passengers' gazes involuntarily turned to the young man at the same time. Some were very suspicious, and some seemed to have quite a bit of experience, expressing an attitude of "of course that's the way it is" and cracking their mouths.</p>
<p>When he reached Rixinlou, the poor thing got off the car leisurely. He maintained a calm attitude throughout.</p>
<h3>The Black Woman's Search for God (XI)</h3>
<p>— Written by Xiao Boner, translated by Yi Xian</p>
<p>She handed the cup back to him, and he made it disappear as if he were a sorcerer, so she laughed, and he laughed too. "It's so clever, sir," she said. "You are a great magician. You are probably instructing the black woman in something. I am looking for God. Where is he?"</p>
<p>"Inside you," the sorcerer said. "And inside me."</p>
<p>"I think so too," the girl said. "But what is he?"</p>
<p>"He is our father," said the sorcerer.</p>
<p>The black girl made a face, thought for a while, and then said, "Why not our mother?"</p>
<p>Then it was the sorcerer's turn to make a face, and he made a face like this. "Our mothers want us to bring them before God," he said. "If I had always been guided by my mother, then I would probably be rich, not a vagrant, a wanderer. But then I would not have seen God either."</p>
<p>"My father beat me from a young age, until I was big enough to resist him with my [Norbo] Kelly]," said the black girl; "Even after that, he wanted to sell me to a white soldier gentleman who had crossed the sea after leaving his wife. I have never said, Our Father who art in heaven,] I always say [Our Grandfather]. I don't want a God who is my father."</p>
<p>"We should still love each other like brothers and sisters," the sorcerer said with a smile; because the amendment of grandfather touched his comical sense. Moreover, he was an amiable person, and always laughed when something was funny.</p>
<p>"Women don't love brothers," said the black girl. "A woman's heart turns from her brothers to strangers, as my heart turns to you."</p>
<p>"Oh! Let's not talk about family: it's just a metaphor," said the sorcerer. "We are members of the same human society, and it can be said that I am your member and you are mine. As for family, let's just leave it be."</p>
<p>"I can't, sir," she said. "God told me that he doesn't care about individuals, sisters, and brothers, etc." "This is just a way of teaching us to love each other," said the sorcerer. "Love those who hate you. Bless those who curse you. Never forget that two blacks cannot become one white."</p>
<p>"I don't want everyone to love me," said the black girl. "I can't love everyone. God told me that I cannot use my [Norbo] Kelly] to beat them simply because I hate people, and that whenever people hate me, their hatred of me cannot give them the right to beat me. But God has made me hate many. There are a group of people who, because they plunder and kill others, are like snakes and must be killed."</p>
<p>"You still shouldn't remind me of this group of people," said the sorcerer. "This group of people makes me very unhappy."</p>
<p>"Forgetting unhappy things is indeed a way to make everything wonderful," said the black girl. "But it doesn't make everything credible; make everything appropriate. But do you really, truly love me, sir?"</p>
<h3>Words from a Thatched Cottage</h3>
<p>— Zizhan</p>
<p>(9) Short and Zhu Zhensheng</p>
<p>During last year's Songhu Anti-Japanese War, six Japanese planes bombed Suzhou. The American aviator Short took off to fight, but unfortunately, his lone plane was surrounded and he was killed. This tragic event is still remembered by the Chinese people. Who knew that thirty years ago, when war between Japan and Russia was imminent and the situation in China was extremely dangerous, a German named Zhu Zhensheng committed suicide to inspire the Chinese?</p>
<p>Zhu Zhensheng lived in China for thirty years, spoke Chinese, wore Chinese clothes, and used a Chinese name. He served as the chief instructor of artillery at Jiangning, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, and Wusong, dedicating himself to Chinese national affairs. When the conflict between Japan and Russia over the three northeastern provinces arose, he was distressed by China's inadequacy and constantly unhappy, especially angry at the Russians. He traveled to Shanghai and met a Russian, questioning him about the three northeastern provinces and accusing the Russians of mistreating China and violating justice. The Russian laughed and replied, "Do you think there's still hope for China? Why worry so much about it?" Zhu became even more angry upon hearing this. He asked an Englishman to mediate the affairs of the three northeastern provinces, but the Englishman gave him the same answer as the Russian. Zhu was furious, appearing almost insane. Upon returning to Jiangning and seeing Chinese people, he would shake their hands and tell them about the suffering of China's future and the urgency of reform. The Chinese responded carelessly, and some even mocked him. One day, at a Western restaurant, he spoke of the three northeastern provinces with clenched teeth and glaring eyes, smashing his cups and plates. The next day, he prepared to leave with a gun, but bystanders stopped him. He returned, closed the door, and committed suicide. As he was dying, he repeatedly shouted, "China cannot be saved! China cannot be saved!" When the servants opened the door to check on him, they found a piece of paper on the table, stating, "Zhu's suicide has nothing to do with China. Germans must not use this as an excuse to make trouble for the Chinese." Such was his concern for our China!</p>

<h3>Gold Price Fluctuates, Slight Increase of Nine Cents</h3>
<p>Although the gold market experienced several ups and downs yesterday, the overall result was stable. Initially, the London exchange rate was unaffected, but the British-American and American-British exchange rates both fell to 75 and 5.625 respectively. The New York silver price decreased by 0.625, and bank private telegrams were at 8.125. However, while the forward silver price for March fell by 7 cents and 9 mills, the December price only decreased by a small amount of 4 cents and 6 mills. The opening exchange rate was slightly tighter than the previous close, but the change was minimal. The opening gold price was 773.5 taels. Major players such as Daxingyong and Shou Lai sold, but due to positive market sentiment and favorable bank internal prices, the price gradually rose despite falling to 2.5 taels. At this point, Datong repeatedly bought US dollars, pushing the price up to 6 taels and 8 cents, but it gradually decreased afterward, and the exchange rate also calmed down. HSBC's listed price initially decreased by 1 cent and 25 mills for sterling and 25 cents for US dollars, but it only rebounded once. Speculator Wu sold several times, and players such as Fuyu also sold, causing a further decline. Later, due to the heavy selling by banks such as Dadecheng, Tongfengheng, and others, the price fell further to 770 taels. At this time, the exchange rate was also more pessimistic, and it seemed difficult to sell US dollars for June at 375. However, market sentiment remained good, and suddenly, Macgarry bought at 3125, gradually improving to over 4 taels. The trend was mostly fluctuating. Before long, it fell to 0.05 cents. At this time, Hengxing opened 140 spot contracts on behalf of the Central Bank, and buyers seemed eager, causing the price to rebound to 771.9 taels at the close. Short sellers reduced prices to sell, increasing by 12 taels accordingly. The swap prices for March and April also fell, with a discount ranging from 3.4 to 4.2 taels. Spot contracts were all being swapped out, indicating that the underlying reserves were gradually becoming more active. The market situation for the first half of the day is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening price was 773.5 taels, an increase of 2.5 taels compared to the previous close. The opening exchange rate was slightly tight, with the current price for sterling at 1 shilling and 8 pence and 25 mills, and US dollars at 28 yuan and 8125. However, the tightness was not significant. Daxingyong immediately started selling aggressively, causing the price to fall from 3 taels and 8 cents to 2.5 taels. However, due to the competitive buying by Yifengyong, Yongfuchang, Zhaofengchang, and others, the price rose to over 4 taels. Hengyu made further purchases, pushing the price to 5 taels. Holland sold US dollars for April to Mitsui at 28 yuan and 9375, causing the price to retreat to 4 taels and 4 cents. However, market sentiment remained very stable. Yuanheng and Wupin advanced to 6 taels. Datong sought to close US dollars for March at 875 but failed, so they bought US dollars for April at 875. Dadecheng did not advance, pushing the price up to 6 taels and 6 cents. The exchange rate for US dollars in April was 875, and Citibank also blocked, causing a drop of 1 tael. There was a lot of fluctuation at this time. After rising to 6 taels and 8 cents, sellers became active. Citibank sold US dollars for March to Sassoon in July, and Fuyu and Hengyu sold on the market for 5 taels. Furthermore, Macgarry sold 6875 for March, causing a fall to 4 taels and 2 cents. HSBC's listed price was also revealed at this time, with sterling decreasing by 25 and US dollars decreasing by 25. The trend was fluctuating, and it once rebounded by around 2 taels, to 5 taels and 5 cents. US dollars for March at 75 could be closed. Daxingyong continuously sold contracts, causing a decline to within 3 taels. Macgarry bought US dollars for June at 25, Qingfayong, Zhifengyong, and Yongjin advanced to over 3 taels. Ruixing sold at this time, but due to stable market sentiment, a further decline was seen. Fuchang advanced contracts on the market, reaching 4 taels and 3 cents. Wupin cashed out, causing the price to fluctuate around 3 taels. Citibank was willing to sell US dollars for April at 9375. Yuanmaoyong sold down to 2 taels and 5 cents. Zhaofengchang advanced contracts, improving again to 3 taels and 8 cents. After this, a selling wave started. Dadecheng first sold aggressively, and Yuankangxiang, Yuanchunyuan, and Xinyong all sold down to within 3 taels. Fuyu, Tongfeng, and Heng sold down to 2 taels. Zhifengyong and Daxingyong sold even more contracts, causing a fall to within 1 tael. US dollars for June at 375 were also difficult to sell, reaching 70 taels before a rebound was seen. Hengyu advanced slightly, gradually rising to around 2 taels. Macgarry bought US dollars for June at 3125. The exchange rate still had the potential to improve further, but there was not much trading in the market, so the price fluctuated and rose, gradually increasing to 4 taels and 4 cents. At this time, US dollars for June at 25 seemed sellable. However, retail investors cashed out, and Yifengyong also sold, bringing the price down to 2 taels. Although there was a lack of trading by banks, the internal prices loosened slightly accordingly. Bingxing sold aggressively, and Fuchang also sold, breaking through 1 tael again, falling to 0.05 cents. At this time, Hengxing opened spot contracts on behalf of the Central Bank, preventing the gold price from falling further. Later, a slight rebound was seen. Fuyu and Hengyu also advanced, reaching 2 taels. Before long, the closing price was 771.9 taels. After the market closed, Hengxing continued to open spot contracts on behalf of the Central Bank, reaching over 2 taels, so Wupin bought at 2 taels. Finally, Bingxing continued to sell, retreating to 1 tael and 67 cents. The highest price during the half-day was 776.8 taels, and the lowest price was 770 taels, a fluctuation of 6.8 taels. The final result was a slight increase of 9 cents compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The listed price shrank by 25 due to HSBC's listed US exchange rate, totaling 28 yuan and 375. The alloy price was 845 taels, 8 cents, and 1 mill. Based on the closing price, approximately 73 taels, 9 cents, and 1 mill were deposited, an increase of over 6 taels compared to the previous close. The registered prices for this month were 781 taels, 777 taels for March, 772 taels for April, and 774 taels for makeup.</p>
<p>There were many eager sellers on the trading floor, but due to good market sentiment, a balance was achieved. Daxingyong, Fuyu, Bingxing, Ruixing, Yuankangxiang, Yuanchunyuan, Xinyong, Tongfeng, Heng, and Dadecheng were all sellers. Hengxing, Fuchang, Zhaofengchang, Yuanheng, Hongxing, Zhifengyong, Qingfayong, Fayong, Yifengyong, Dafayong, and others were all buyers. There was little trading among the Dalian gang. The Guang gang and Hengxing jointly advanced 280 contracts. Shengsheng had limited trading. Speculator Wu sold slightly.</p>
<p>Hengxing was entrusted by the Central Bank at the close to open 210 spot contracts, including 140 contracts priced at 1 tael and 70 contracts at 2 taels and 2 cents.</p>
<p>The price of cooked red continued to fall. The opening price was 13 taels, and there were many sellers, but no one inquired. Later, Yingfenghang was willing to sell with an increase of 12 taels, resulting in a formal transaction. The transaction volume was less than 100 taels, purchased by Dadecheng.</p>
<p>Swap prices were also low. Spot contracts, such as Yingfenghang, Ganchangxiang, etc., were all swapping out March and April contracts. The initial opening was lower than the previous day. Ruikang discounted 56 contracts to Yingfenghang at 4 taels and 2 cents, and Dadecheng discounted 140 contracts to Ganchangxiang at 4 taels and 2 cents. However, Ganchangxiang, etc., continued to swap out, so the price became even lower. Yingfenghang pressed the price to discount, and Hongxing immediately discounted 140 contracts at a price of 3 taels and 6 cents. Dadecheng also discounted 70 contracts to Yingfenghang at the same price, and another 70 contracts at 3 taels and 5 cents. Ganchangxiang swapped 70 contracts with Ruikang, discounting only 3 taels and 4 cents. Hengxing sold 105 contracts from Ganchangxiang at a price of 777 taels and also sold 105 contracts from Yingfenghang at a price of 7 taels and 1 cent and a half, all for March settlement transactions.</p>
<p>There were turbulent waves and rapid changes this week. The news of the US silver coin proposal was mixed. The highest price at the beginning of the week was 780 taels and 3 cents. The next day, due to unfavorable market news, there was a sharp drop of over 20 taels, with strong winds and heavy rain, ultimately breaking through the 760 tael mark, reaching only 57 taels and 5 cents, the lowest price since the lunar new year. Afterward, it hovered around 70 taels. In the end, compared to last Saturday, there was a total decrease of 9 taels and 4 cents (a total of 22 taels and 8 cents for the entire week). Overseas silver markets were also trending upward, while exchange rates saw a counter-reaction and fell. Therefore, sterling in the local market was firm, while the US dollar was stable.</p>
<h3>Foreign Exchange Stable in Sterling, Slightly Tight in US Dollars</h3>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, the London exchange rate for both near and far terms remained unchanged. The British exchange rate against the US dollar fell by 75, and the US exchange rate against sterling decreased by 5.625. The New York silver price decreased by 625. The forward silver price at the gold exchange decreased by 7 cents and 9 mills, but the furthest month only decreased by a small amount of 4 cents and 6 mills.

At the initial opening, Datong was very eager to close US dollars, but it gradually loosened afterward. HSBC's listed price decreased by 125 for sterling and a small 25 for US dollars. The situation was still stable at this time. Later, the gold market trended lower, and the exchange rate also gradually felt sluggish, but there were few transactions. The situation was still stable in the end. Banks such as Huabi, Macgarry, and Korea all bought sterling, while Bombay Datong and Dongyang banks sold.

<h3>Weekend Tael Discount Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Saturday. The foreign tael rate remained steady at 7 cents, 1 cent, and 5 mills throughout the morning and afternoon. Because banks were closed in the afternoon, there was no activity in the buying and selling of foreign currencies. The volume of remittance and bill exchanges in the market was also limited, with only 195,000 in the morning and 308,000 in the afternoon. There was no trading in banknotes in either market. The volume of checks was 85,000 in the morning and 40,000 in the afternoon. The total amount of foreign tael transactions between banks was over 900,000, with no inflow or outflow of banknotes. The tael discount rate was 2 points in both the morning and afternoon, and there were also head-tail rates in three or four markets. Bank tael transactions were generally not accepted on Saturdays, so the market was very quiet. The total volume of bill transactions for Chinese merchants was over 1.1 million, and the total volume for foreign merchants was 800,000 to 900,000. Various commodity exchange taxes and miscellaneous charges totaled over 2 million, and special charges totaled over 1.9 million. The volume of goods entering warehouses was 300,000, and the volume of goods leaving warehouses was 200,000. The total volume of foreign public bills transacted by money shops was over 3.9 million, and the total volume of silver public bills transacted was over 27 million, slightly higher due to the small ratio period. The total volume of foreign head-tail transactions was over 1.1 million, and the total volume of silver head-tail transactions was over 4.4 million. The total volume of remittances from various routes was over 300,000, and the total volume of foreign tael lending was over 1.2 million.

<h3>Conflicting Views on Securities</h3>
<p>Inconsistent Rise and Fall of Public Bonds</p>
<p>丨No Trading on the 27th Due to Settlement丨</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trading of April futures contracts on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange began, but due to it being a Saturday, there were very few participants. Only 5,000 distant-month salt tax contracts were traded throughout the day. Because the financial sector still had needs and rumors spread that there were people mediating and resolving the Sino-Japanese issue, there were still many short positions in the market. There were no transactions in April contracts, so there was no room for maneuver. The opening price of the 18 Customs bonds rose sharply by 6 jiao due to the small exclusive nature of the following day. The price of disarmament bonds also rose by 1 jiao. The prices of the remaining bonds fell by varying amounts of 3 to 5 jiao due to selling of the 11th and 34th bonds. The second session was peaceful, with slight fluctuations of 1 to 2 jiao. The unified salt tax still rose by 5 fen to 2 jiao and 5 fen due to differences in supply and demand. In the afternoon, market sentiment was relatively strong, with a uniform increase of 3 to 5 jiao, likely due to buying of the 5th, 21st, and 32nd bonds. At the close, the 18 Customs bonds, disarmament bonds, and 19 Customs bonds continued to rise by 1 to 2 jiao. The remaining bonds had slight fluctuations of 1 jiao or 1 jiao and 5 fen. The trend was quite stable. Given the current critical situation of the war and the poor diplomatic atmosphere, this phenomenon was considered unexpected by most. However, it is unknown that market viewpoints differ, with benevolent people seeing benevolence and wise people seeing wisdom, and cannot be generalized. Yesterday's market price results showed inconsistent rises and falls. The 18 Customs bonds rose sharply by 1 jiao, while the unified tax remained unchanged. The remaining bonds only had slight fluctuations of 1 jiao or 1 jiao and 5 fen. The situation can be described as peaceful. The total transaction volume was 3,667,000 yuan, with only 7,000 yuan in spot transactions. Distant-month unified salt tax contracts accounted for just over 1.4 million, and aside from the full 635,000 and 55,000 for 18 Customs bonds, the remaining bonds accounted for about 300,000 to 500,000 each. There will be no trading on the 27th due to settlement.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Initially Stable, Then Rises</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Customs reported that the stock market on Friday was initially calm and slightly mixed. Before long, due to the dissipation of selling pressure, the market situation turned upward. US government bonds and bank stocks rebounded strongly. Commodities, except for silver, were also firm. The total transaction volume for the day was 1,070,000 shares. The closing prices of several stocks are listed below (in US dollars): Chemical Paint 76.5, US Foreign Electric Power 5, US Hardware 4, Bethlehem Steel 12, Canadian Railway 8.75, Kodak 53, Electric Bonds 12.5, General Foods 22, General Motors 11.5, Railway Labels 17, Goodyear Rubber Tire 11.5, Roche Films 14.5, Paramount Films 0.75, Pennsylvania Railway 15.5, New Jersey Public Exchange 1.5, Country Combined Radio 3.25, Siemens Bed 6, US Tuotie 26, Texaco Sulfur Mine 17.

<h3>Cotton Yarn Market Continues to Trend Upward</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market continued to rise due to the firmness of raw cotton. Although there have been no large-scale transactions of spot yarn recently, the trend has been relatively active. As a result, there has been more short covering, and the market has been particularly tense. Market sentiment in the afternoon became even stronger. Due to the market being closed on Monday for settlement, most cautious individuals flattened their positions overnight. However, in terms of the overall situation, the situation in Rehe is becoming increasingly serious, and it is difficult for credit to loosen. The future cannot be predicted.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn Rises by 1.1 Taels This Month</h3>
<p>The opening market was strong due to rising US cotton, and market sentiment was calm. Prices for all months rose by 5, 6, and 7 cents. In the afternoon, the raw cotton market was even firmer, causing the cotton yarn market to rise, with prices for all months increasing by 2, 3, and 4 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 24,600 bales. Rongxing sold 1,050 bales, Mingde sold 1,250 bales, Ruidong sold 1,950 bales, Lichang sold 1,200 bales, Chongan sold 1,350 bales, Yichang sold 1,250 bales, and Yongda sold 700 bales.

<p>May 1431 841,300</p>
<h3>896 Bales of Cotton Yarn Sold</h3>

The buying amounts for each gang were as follows: Inland 251, Anqing 30, Yunnan 150, Wuhu 5, Tongxing 35, Ningbo 15, Shantou 50, Sichuan 360, Xiamen 10.</p>
<h3>Cotton Market Rise Strengthens</h3>
<p>The cotton market rise was fierce, and the situation was quite strong. Due to the stability of the gold market and the rebound of US cotton, a squeeze occurred at the Ningbo Yaohua Exchange. A portion came to Shanghai to purchase 20,000 to 30,000 piculs to cover their positions, so the market was dry and short covering was particularly urgent, leading to a sharp rise. However, the trend of foreign cotton remained flat.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Improves by 5 to 6 Cents Again</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard opening market was strong due to rising US cotton. The residual momentum from the previous day had not subsided in the market, and the situation was even tighter. Prices for all months rose by 3 to 4 cents. In the afternoon, there were many short coverings, and prices for all months rose again by 2 to 3 cents. The total transaction volume for the day was 69,400 piculs. Yuanda sold 7,900 piculs, Changfeng sold 3,300 piculs, Suilong sold 2,000 piculs, Jifeng sold 1,500 piculs, Tongfu sold 1,600 piculs, Rongxing sold 1,000 piculs, Tongxing sold 1,700 piculs, Yongda sold 1,100 piculs, and Tonghe sold 1,400 piculs.

<h3>US Cotton Rebounds, British and Indian Cotton Show Fatigue</h3>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton was firm due to a lack of sellers, and Wall Street was strong, with short covering. Futures prices rose by 8 to 12 points, and spot prices rose by 10 points. British cotton futures fell by 45 points, and spot prices fell by 9 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 15 points. The Indian cotton market was stable, with European exporters selling. Pingle and Aumra fell by 0.75 rupee, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.5 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 24th):</p>

<h3>US Cotton Soft Due to Economic Decline</h3>
<p>New York, February 24: A report on the cotton market for the week states that the cotton market price rose this week due to the Smith Cotton Act, which aims to reduce cotton production this year, being passed in the Senate. However, it soon rebounded, and the market has been unsettled recently. The reason for this is the weakness in the securities market, and the financial and economic situation in the United States is also worrying. The first delivery notice for the March contract was for approximately 42,000 bales. The Cotton Exchange Communication Agency estimates that there were 2,863,000 bales of cotton on the cotton market at the end of January this year, compared to 3,919,000 bales at the same time last year and 1,839,000 bales at the same time the year before last. However, those holding spot goods seem quite confident. Sales in the South were very low this week. The regulations issued by the Ministry of Agriculture to manage this year's cotton production loans limit individual loans to 300 yuan, with the condition of reducing cotton fields in three. Some in the industry do not believe that this method will be effective in reducing the total amount of cotton fields. The House of Representatives committee reviewing the Smith Cotton Act was satisfied, but whether it will become law is still questionable, as it is expected that some in the House of Representatives will oppose it. The US cotton weekend statistics are attached on the left (in thousands of bales): 1932 1933</p>

<h3>Tongzhou Cottonseed All Sold</h3>
<p>Recently, the arrival of Tongzhou cottonseed has not been surging. There were a combination of loose warehouses and packaged seeds, totaling 3,300 piculs of foreign seeds and 1,100 piculs of ink seeds. All were sold yesterday. The price of ink seeds was 2 yuan and 4 jiao, and the price of foreign seeds (standard of 50 jin of meat) was 2 yuan and 6 jiao. The market was flat. It has been found that only cottonseed from Tongzhou has arrived since the new year (no cottonseed from other places has arrived).</p>
<h3>Grain and Rice Market Situation</h3>
<p>Yin Yuan Rice Price Rises by 12 Cents</p>
<p>(Shanghai South) Yesterday, the source of rice was blocked, and the supply of early rice was completely absent. Both retail and wholesale markets were sluggish. Although there was no new supply, the market remained stable. Few rice merchants from Suzhou, Tongxiang, Qingjiao, and Nangang were present, and prices did not fluctuate much. The price of Du Jian rice remained stable. Yin Yuan rice was scarce and popular. For example, in Songjiang, the price of Yin Yuan rice rose by 20 cents per dan (unit of weight). The movement of Bian Yuan rice was sluggish, and the price slightly decreased.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, there was a lack of supply from the river. There were only 130 to 140 boats in the river. White粳 rice shops continued to sell, and the market was generally stable, with a slight increase for medium-grade rice. There was very little Bo粳 early rice in the river, and the price showed a tightening trend. The movement of Yangbu Jian rice was normal, and the price remained stable. Du Jian rice rose by about one chi (unit of length, approximately one foot). The sales of Bai Yuan rice were very sluggish, and the price showed a downward trend again.</p>
<h3>Native Xian Rice Sales are Very Strong</h3>
<p>| Nanjing Xian Rice Continues to Arrive in Shanghai |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sales of native Xian rice were still mainly in the local market. Because the supply from the river was intercepted by boatmen midway, the supply was not strong, and there were not enough goods to choose from. Moreover, the price was high, even higher than that of native Xian rice. Therefore, the demand for native Xian rice increased. The native Xian rice market was active in the local market, and there was a need for market expansion. However, the sales of Fujian rice were not strong recently, and there was a continuous supply. The market could only break even. A total of 337 packages of Jiangxi Machine Late rice, 120 packages of Machine Early rice, 100 packages of Hunan Machine Red rice, 200 packages of Red Coarse rice, and 82 packages of Petroleum rice were sold. Nanjing Xian rice has been arriving at the port recently. Yesterday, 286 packages of newly arrived Che Xian rice and 200 packages of Coarse Xian rice were released. Among them, the Coarse rice was all purchased by the Fuzhou merchants, and the rest were purchased by the local market.</p>
<h3>This Month's Flour Market is Soft and Declining</h3>
<p>| Distant Months Slightly Higher |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market was stable in the morning for each month, with the price of foreign wheat rising by about 10 cents. Outsiders were concerned because the situation was becoming more serious. Large and small factories had no intention to sell, so the market was relatively stable amid mutual avoidance. Factories also hedged against the possibility of problems with the supply of foreign wheat in the future, and standards would inevitably be affected. Therefore, everyone acted cautiously. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading was still light. Because the end of the month was approaching, and deliveries were due, factories had plenty of chips. Only the Jin merchants and Tianjin merchants moved slightly, so prices naturally softened. The prices of distant months were generally fluctuating, and both insiders and outsiders adopted a wait-and-see attitude, with no intention to enter or exit the market. However, there were very few sellers, and the market was slightly higher. As a result, this month's price fell by 7.5 li (unit of currency, 1/1000 of a yuan) compared to the previous day, March remained unchanged, April rose by 5 li, May and June rose by 7.5 li, and July remained unchanged.</p>
<h3>Wheat Futures Mostly Unsold</h3>
<p>| Only July Futures Saw Some Trading |</p>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market was very quiet in the morning and afternoon. This month has already been delivered, so there was no market. From March to June, all sessions were completely unsold. This was because inland merchants had not been inquiring for a long time, and hedging traders did not dare to enter the market, so the market remained stagnant. Only July saw a small amount of trading, and the volume was not large. The price was slightly better than the previous day by 1 fen (unit of currency, 1/100 of a yuan).</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Factory Goods Have Been Released</h3>
<p>But Sales Are Still Slow</p>
<p>The number of soybean cake goods released by the factories has increased, but the demand has not been urgent. Therefore, factories have found it difficult to raise prices, and the market situation has turned flat. Yellow soybean trading was also slow, but market sentiment was very stable, with no fluctuations. There was little certainty about future changes. Yesterday, the price of Pudong Du soybeans was 4 liang (unit of weight, approximately 50 grams) and 7 qian (unit of currency, 1/10 of a liang) and 5 fen (unit of currency, 1/10 of a qian). One hundred packages were traded. This was because they were large, screened beans, which commanded a higher price. Chongming Sand Yellow soybeans were still popular with Fuzhou merchants. Although the supply was small, there were still 50,000 to 60,000 packages of goods in storage, making it difficult for the market to develop.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Only Over 200 Pieces of Chinese Silk Were Shipped to France</h3>
<p>Recently, the French Lyon and Marseille raw silk markets have been sluggish due to the encroachment of rayon and Japanese silk, making it difficult for Chinese silk shipments to France to improve. Yesterday, the French mail ship Chinard de Meysencq exported only 237 pieces of yellow and white silk from firms like Sin Fuh Dah Chang to ports like Marseille and Lyon.</p>
<p>Zhen Mei Green Tea Market Price Drops Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign tea market saw sporadic purchases of Wuyuan Gaozhuang Zhen Mei green tea by British and French merchants. A total of 210 boxes were traded in the entire market. The price of Zhongguan goods was 70 taels (unit of weight, approximately 37.5 grams), a decrease of 2 to 3 taels compared to the previous day. It was found that the cost of imported goods has been tightening recently due to rising exchange rates. Chinese tea merchants' ability to persist at this time was weakening again. The selling price of tea continued to decline without any increase.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: Vegetable Oil is Average</h3>
<p>Vegetable oil prices are average due to the sluggish soybean oil market in recent days. Local merchants have not shown any intention to purchase. Although there was a large volume of transactions yesterday, the price slightly rebounded. The transaction volume was 1,680 dan, and the price was 12 taels and 1 qian per dan, which was purchased by a large local soap factory.</p>
<h3>Metal: Black Iron Sheet Spot Goods are Severely Lacking</h3>
<p>The black iron sheet market has been very popular recently due to the purchases of enamel factories. Therefore, standards are rising steadily. For example, the price of three-zhang (unit of thickness) iron sheets has soared to 8 taels and 7 qian 5 fen due to the shortage of goods. Four-zhang iron sheets were 8 taels and 5 qian, five-zhang and six-zhang iron sheets were 8 taels and 3 qian, seven-zhang and eight-zhang iron sheets were 8 taels and 6 qian, nine-zhang iron sheets were 8 taels and 8 qian, ten-zhang iron sheets were 9 taels, eleven-zhang and twelve-zhang iron sheets were 9 taels and 2 qian 5 fen, and thirteen-zhang iron sheets were 9 taels and 5 qian. Two chi (unit of length, approximately one foot) and six chi eighteen-zhang iron sheets were 9 taels and 5 qian. However, the supply of spot goods has been extremely scarce recently, and market sentiment has been good. Therefore, the market is likely to rise further. It is said that overseas prices have been very firm recently, so local prices are unlikely to fall.</p>
<p>One-Fen Steel Plate Jumps Up by More Than 6 Qian</p>
<p>The English steel plate market originally had the potential to improve due to the small amount of goods arriving and the high prices. However, the recent surge in trading has led to a shortage of goods, and standards have been rising steadily. For example, 2.5-li (unit of thickness) steel plate opened at 8 taels and 5 qian, half-fen (unit of thickness) steel plate opened at 7 taels, 7.5-li steel plate opened at 6 taels and 3 qian 5 fen, 1-fen steel plate opened at 6 taels and 3 qian 5 fen, and steel plates thicker than half-fen were generally estimated at 6 taels. However, yesterday, the 1-fen patterned steel plate was severely lacking, and the standard jumped up by more than 6 qian, opening at 6 taels and 8 qian 5 fen per dan. Some were even bidding 7 taels. It is said that the main reason for the strong sales was the purchases by military factories. The strong sales to other areas also played a role. It is also said that overseas prices recently reached 7 pounds and 15 shillings, so local prices are unlikely to fall in the short term.</p>

<p>(Beiping) 10,000 Japanese infantry and 5,000 cavalry are advancing towards Lingnan. The vanguard troops made formal contact with our troops on the evening of the 24th. Because of the flat terrain of Chaoyang and Kailu, which is difficult to defend, we are focusing our efforts on Lingnan, Lingyuan, and northward to Chifeng and Jianping. It is expected that the Japanese troops will advance steadily, and the main battle will be on the Lingyuan-Chifeng line. Our troops are in high spirits and are prepared to fight to the death. However, there is a shortage of food supplies in the area. Tang Yulin has sent a telegram requesting assistance from all parties. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Qinhuangdao at 10:00 AM on the 25th stated that at dawn today, approximately 20,000 Japanese and rebel troops secretly crossed Shaomao Mountain and launched a fierce attack on our positions east of Laoye Temple. Our artillery team set up artillery at Heishan, taking advantage of the high ground. The enemy's aircraft began bombing our positions at noon. The British Consulate was severely bombed, and the casualties among residents were incalculable. At around 3:00 PM, the majority of the Japanese and rebel troops advanced from Baimiao, Yaowangmiao, and Zengjiafen, with the rebel troops acting as the vanguard and traitors as guides. After our troops resisted with all their might, they ultimately failed to succeed. Currently, there are no changes on the Lingnan front. (26th Dispatch) (Tianjin) A telegram from Rehe stated that more than 20 enemy aircraft bombed Chaoyang, Lingnan, and other places on the morning of the 26th.

After being surrounded by Cui's troops on three sides, over 1,000 rebel troops were disarmed by us at Aigen Temple, and a Mongolian staff officer of Zhang Hai peng was captured. According to his confession, the Japanese army planned to advance into the plains and deserts with 300 armored vehicles. We are on strict guard. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to foreign news, after changes in our troop formations in Kailu, our regular army has dispatched reinforcements from Chifeng to intercept and engage them. A fierce battle is underway. Last night, puppet troops were discovered in Beiliang attempting to sneak in across the mountains. They were defeated by Liu's battalion of Tang's troops, with many captured and killed or wounded. Because the Japanese troops attempted to attack from the east of Chaoyang, crossing the mountains, but failed to succeed, they concentrated their forces this morning and attacked Taipingfang from Wujiazi, outflanking Chaoyang. Dong's troops have built strong fortifications in the northwest of Chaoyang. (26th Dispatch)</p>

Zhang Haipeng's advance unit engaged in fierce fighting with Zhang's regiment of our front-line troops. After failing to attack Kailu twice, the enemy, in order to avoid casualties, used Zhang's unit as the vanguard, with only one Japanese artillery team placed at the vanguard and the 39th and 34th Divisions responsible for the left and right flanks. Zhang Haipeng's rebel troops totaled 12,000 men. At 2:00 AM, the artillery fire was intense. Our side replaced the new defensive lines, and the battle had not stopped at the time of the telegram. (25th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) When someone questioned a certain figure in Chinese military circles about the Japanese claim that Japanese troops had occupied Chaoyang, that figure replied that this was a familiar trick of the Japanese to fabricate and exaggerate victories according to their pre-determined plans. Yesterday, we received an official report from Chaoyang dated the morning of the 25th, stating that everything was peaceful and quiet, and there had been no fighting. There have been no subsequent reports since then, probably because there was nothing to report. The Beiping Telegraph Bureau still received a telegram from Chaoyang last night, which included a statement that there was no trace of the enemy at the front, indicating that the area had not been occupied by Japanese troops. He Zhuguo, the commander of the Chinese army in Qinhuangdao, received news from the front last night that there was a fierce battle in Lingnan. Two brigades of the Chinese army were holding key passes in a good defensive position, resisting the attack of 20,000 Japanese and Manchu troops. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Patriotic Young Man Drowns Himself in the Sea</h3>
<p>A Suicide Note with Extremely Tragic Words</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to people from Yangliuqing Town, there was a man named Zhang Enhong in the town, 23 years old, living in Youfang Alley. He was a handsome young man with an extraordinary temperament. Since the September 18th Incident, he had gone to the Northeast twice, but had not fulfilled his ambition to resist Japan and save the country. On January 19th of this year, he went to Qingdao to visit his cousin Dai Ziliang, seeking work to save the country. Dai was the captain of a warship in the Northeast Fleet, but there was no opportunity. Every time they discussed the Northeast Incident, he would regret it all day long. On January 27th, Dai's warship was ordered to leave, and he advised Zhang to return home. Zhang remained silent and immediately went out and drowned himself in the sea. The next day, his body was washed up on the beach by the tide. Four suicide notes were found on his body, wrapped in oiled paper. The words were extremely tragic, roughly stating that China was in danger, Japan was hateful, and he hoped that the Chinese people would unite and quickly save the country.

<h3>Japanese Foreign Ministry Prepares Withdrawal Procedures</h3>
<p>Cabinet Decision Will Be Followed by Consultation with Privy Council</p>
<p>Withdrawal Time Approximately in Mid-March</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry has begun drafting a concrete plan for consulting the Privy Council regarding withdrawal from the League of Nations, divided into four parts: (1) The notice to be submitted to the League of Nations Secretariat regarding the withdrawal; (2) The matter of revising the Treaty of Versailles due to the submission of the notice; (3) The obligations to be borne by the Japanese government for two years after submitting the notice; (4) The handling of the Disarmament Conference, the Labor Conference, and other international conferences hosted by the League of Nations. The above four documents will take several days to complete. Therefore, the Cabinet will decide on this consultation proposal and submit it to the Privy Council, and notification will be given to the League of Nations around March 10th to 15th. In addition, due to the importance of the issues of mandated territories, the Labor Conference, and the Economic Conference, related ministries have been ordered to investigate as soon as possible. Some cabinet members advocate that the Labor Conference and the Disarmament Conference should continue to be attended from a different standpoint. Roughly speaking, among the four disarmament representatives, Ambassador Matsudaira to the UK will remain until the end to observe the trend of the conference. The other three representatives, such as Ambassador Sato, and the military plenipotentiaries Tatekawa and Nagano, will each return to their posts and to their home countries.

Today, the organ of the Fascist Party wrote an article discussing this issue, saying that Japan is currently controlling the entire western Pacific, and its position is sufficient to intercept sea lanes between San Francisco, the Hawaiian Islands, the Philippines, and Shanghai. Therefore, from the perspective of the United States, it would be beneficial for Japan to relinquish the islands. If Japan were to relinquish them, then the islands could be returned to Germany. [The current situation in the Pacific is quite unfavorable to the issue of naval disarmament. If the aforementioned islands were to be restored to German ownership, then a new element would appear in the military position in the Pacific.] (25th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<h3>A Certain Important Official Discusses the League of Nations' Handling of the Sino-Japanese Case</h3>
<p>The Reason for the Sudden Change in Attitude of Britain and France</p>
<p>The Chinese People Should Have an Even Stronger Resolve in the Future</p>
<p>(Geneva) A certain important official of our delegation said that the report of the Nineteen-Member Committee was finally deemed fair and impartial by the General Assembly yesterday and was passed in its entirety. This was something that was unimaginable three months ago. Our side's hard work and patience were not in vain. It is regrettable that the League of Nations failed to take decisive action at the beginning of the Sino-Japanese dispute, leading to the deterioration of the situation and causing huge losses to China. When China submitted the case to the Executive Yuan, the attitude of various countries was mostly noncommittal. Even during the special session of the General Assembly in November, there were great differences in opinions between small and large countries. At that time, the pro-Japanese side, led by Simon, had a bad outlook. However, Japan's obstinacy and hypocrisy aroused dissatisfaction among the Nineteen-Member Committee, and their attitude suddenly turned tough. The League of Nations had no choice but to decide to condemn Japan. In addition to the aforementioned situation, factors that contributed to the passage of this report included the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, the United States' wholehearted cooperation with the League of Nations, and the dangerous development of the European political landscape. For example, the widely publicized secret pact between Germany and Italy made Britain and France feel greatly uneasy and deeply aware of the need to uphold the alliance and strengthen the League of Nations' reputation, which was also a major reason for promoting the League of Nations' determination. Now the whole world is on China's side rather than Japan's. We should also show the world a strongest determination to prove that China can not only resist aggressors but also has the power to drive them out of the country. If we do not work hard, there is little hope of recovering our homeland. The greater the sacrifice, the greater the gain. The opposite is also true. Heaven helps those who help themselves. Japan's abandonment by the whole world is the greatest opportunity for the Chinese people to strive for self-reliance. (Central News Agency dispatch, 25th)</p>

<h3>Soviet Union Eliminates Homeless Children</h3>
<p>(TASS) Moscow - The Soviet Union has recently eliminated homeless children without exception. Previously, there were 100,000 homeless children. They have now been placed in children's homes, and such wandering children are no longer seen on the streets and at doorways. These children were created by imperialist infighting and civil war, and they were homeless, living entirely by begging and stealing. The Soviet government considers these children to be a serious hindrance to society and is therefore striving to eliminate them. In 1919, the People's Committee resolved that the state would provide meals for all children under the age of 14 and built many children's homes to provide them with accommodation. In 1923, the "[Improving Children's Lives Lenin" Fund]] was established, the purpose of which was to reduce homeless children. To date, expenditure on this purpose has reached 137 million rubles, excluding donations from other organizations. Former homeless children have become educated citizens. All children are educated and given occupations. The Vormsok Children's Rehabilitation Center has 40 cattle, 18 horses, 30 sheep, 20 hectares of arable land, and more than a dozen stores. Most children's rehabilitation centers have achieved good results, with the largest producing several thousand rubles annually. The Kharkov Children's Rehabilitation Center can manufacture excellent cameras. The Bosheviki Rehabilitation Center near Moscow has the best results, producing millions of rubles annually. Foreign delegations regard this as a surprising success of the Soviet government. The Soviet Union's achievement in eliminating homeless children is worthy of being the world's first.</p>
<h3>Deng Wen, Commander of the First Army of the Black Army, Telegraphs for Assistance</h3>
<p>Horses Without Saddles, Men Barefoot and Unkempt</p>
<p>Urgently Awaiting Replacements to Fight the Enemy to the Death</p>
<p>Deng Wen, commander of the First Army of Ma Zhanshan's Black Army, telegraphed Ma General's representatives in Shanghai, Duan Zhongfan and Wu Huanzhang, after leading his troops from Heilongjiang to the border of Rehe, as the Japanese again launched a large-scale invasion of Rehe. His army bore the brunt, but the replacements had not yet been completed, and they were extremely distressed. He requested assistance. The original telegram is transcribed below: "Duan Zhongfan and Wu Huanzhang, brothers, to the Northeast Volunteer Army Relief Association, Chu Huiseng, and all directors, may it come to your attention: The Japanese bandits are wreaking havoc and forcibly occupying the Northeast. Chairman Ma Zhanshan led the brave soldiers of our Heilongjiang Province, upholding the banner of righteousness alone and fighting the Japanese enemy to the death, setting an example for the world. However, Heilongjiang Province, a poor and barren land, how can it withstand the wealth of the entire Japanese nation? Its inevitable defeat was expected by Wen and others. When the Soviet army was suddenly defeated and our contact was cut off, Wen followed Chairman Ma's order and transferred to Rehe, fighting thousands of miles for two months. More than a thousand officers and soldiers died under the enemy's gunfire, and six or seven hundred died of cold and starvation. This situation has been reported previously. Now that the brutal Japanese disregard international justice and are not subject to the restraints of justice, and are launching a large-scale attack on Rehe, North China is in turmoil, and the Black Army is once again bearing the brunt. Wen should continue to uphold Chairman Ma's original intention of fighting hard to reverse the decline, and it is his unshirkable responsibility to fight the Japanese to the death. However, our tens of thousands of brave soldiers who have fought for years, traveled thousands of miles, braved death, and sacrificed themselves for the country now have no pay and no clothes to cover their bodies. Moreover, the horses are without saddles and the men are barefoot and unkempt, like prisoners. As a commander, how can Wen drive them to fight? I cannot bear to drive them to their deaths. Those who came earlier have not fully changed their clothes, and those who come later may be even more disheartened. Therefore, I hereby telegraph to you to ask for further assistance, such as military uniforms, shirts, socks, boots, cotton blankets, saddles, large and small radio and telephone equipment, and heavy-duty vehicles, so that the morale of the soldiers can be boosted, our army's punitive power can be increased, the ugly captives can be wiped out, and our homeland can be restored. This will not only be deeply appreciated by all the officers and soldiers of our army, but also benefit the future of the country. The Commander of the First Army of Heilongjiang, Deng Wen, bows in respect."</p>

<p>He Yingqin Will Return to Beijing Soon</p>
<p>Yesterday, He Called a Doctor for Injections to Treat His Old Illness</p>
<p>He Yingqin, Minister of Military Administration, is currently on leave from the central government due to gastrointestinal illness. After a doctor examined him, it was found that there were microorganisms lurking in his liver and intestines, and it would be difficult for him to recover his health unless they were completely eliminated. He then returned to Beijing while ill due to the busy affairs of the ministry. He came to Shanghai yesterday morning to continue to seek medical treatment and examination. According to He's aides, Minister He received an injection from a doctor yesterday and will return to Beijing soon.</p>
<h3>River Shipping Companies Unite</h3>
<p>Resisting the Monopoly of Foreign Merchant Ships</p>
<p>When the Sichuan war occurred last year, large quantities of textiles and cotton yarn ordered by Chongqing, Xupu, and other ports in Shanghai were stopped from being shipped and were stockpiled in Shanghai. Later, as the river water receded, the goods were still not shipped. Recently, as the Sichuan gangs' customers learned that the war had stopped and the upstream water was gradually increasing, they feared that traffic on the Yangtze River would be obstructed, so they telegraphed Shanghai to rush the shipment of goods. This caused a trend of foreign merchant ships competing to load and monopolize, and Chinese ships united to resist. The general situation is reported as follows:</p>
<h3>Foreign Ships Compete for Shipping</h3>
<p>Last year, due to the war in Sichuan, the goods accumulated in Shanghai were mostly foreign cloth and cotton yarn. Recently, Sichuan gangs have repeatedly telegraphed Shanghai to ship the goods to prevent traffic on the Yangtze River from being obstructed. The yarn and cloth are transported by two routes of merchant ships: one is a direct ship from Shanghai to Chongqing, and the other is a ship from Shanghai to Yichang, which is then transferred to Chongqing. The foreign merchants in Shanghai who specialize in Sichuan river shipping, the Jiejiang Company, have a total of twelve ships, followed by Taikoo Jardine, which also has more than ten ships. Now, the Jiejiang Company is competing to carry the cargo directly to Chongqing, and Taikoo Jardine is distributing the cargo to Yichang for transshipment. The competition has now started.</p>
<h3>Increase in Water Rates</h3>
<p>The main cargo for Sichuan river transportation is cotton yarn. Over the years, foreign ships have drastically reduced water rates in order to defeat Chinese merchant ships, reducing them to as low as six taels of silver per piece in the shortest time, causing many Sichuan river shipping companies, such as the Chuyun Company, to suspend operations. Based on the success of the price reduction strategy, foreign merchants gradually increased the freight rates again in the autumn and winter of last year. Cotton yarn water rates rose from six taels to eight taels, then from eight taels to ten taels, and then from ten taels to twelve taels, more than doubling. Special water rates are also required during shallow water.</p>
<h3>Chinese Ships Unite</h3>
<p>Last year, seven or eight small Sichuan river shipping companies were squeezed out by foreign ships and went bankrupt. At that time, the Chinese merchant Minsheng Company raised capital and bought all the suspended ships in order to consolidate the scattered forces and prevent the Sichuan river shipping rights from falling entirely into the hands of foreigners. The Minsheng Shipping Company then suddenly rose up and launched Shanghai-Chongqing, Shanghai-Yichang, Hankou-Yichang, and Xupu routes, with a total of more than ten ships, including the Minquan and Minzhu, to compete with Jiejiang and other foreign merchants. This time, when the Sichuan gangs rushed to load the accumulated goods, foreign ships took the opportunity to raise water rates. The Minsheng Company then united with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Sanbei, Yongxing, and Jiejiyuyu and other Chinese shipping companies to form the Sichuan River Chinese Ship Alliance, gathering strength to regain shipping rights, breaking the monopoly of foreign ships, and agreeing to reduce water rates for goods shipped from Shanghai to various parts of Sichuan from March 1st. The Shanghai branch notified the customer that yesterday, the foreign shipping companies in the city received an urgent telegram from Yichang, reporting that the Chinese ship union had been established and was completely to resist foreign merchant ships, and that they should quickly seek to salvage the situation. Each foreign merchant obtained the report and has been secretly discussing countermeasures.</p>
<h3>Japanese Cause Trouble, Japanese Police Commit Violence</h3>
<p>The Mainland News reports that at 5:50 p.m. yesterday, a Japanese man driving a cargo truck hit a Chinese pedestrian on Dalianwan Road and tried to escape. A Chinese policeman from a certain station saw this and quickly blew his whistle to stop him. Immediately, many Chinese people gathered. A young man described what he had seen of the accident. Suddenly, a Japanese policeman on the scene stepped forward and slapped him on the cheek. The crowd was outraged and surrounded the Japanese policeman and prevented the cargo truck from escaping. Other police officers rushed to the scene and dispersed the crowd. The injured Chinese man was taken to Sacred Heart Hospital by the fire brigade's ambulance. It is reported that he was injured in both legs and abdomen.</p>
<h3>Two Japanese Warships Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>The "Izumo" is Here Again</p>
<p>The North China Daily News reports that two Japanese cruisers sailed into Shanghai yesterday morning and berthed at the seventh, eighth, ninth, and tenth buoys in the middle of the Huangpu River, opposite the Japanese Mail Steamship Company's Huishan Pier and the Osaka Shipping Company's Yangshu Pier. One of them was the ship that was stationed on the side of the Japanese Consulate on Huangpu Road during the Shanghai War last year, attracting much attention.</p>
<h3>The Work and Organization of the Northeast Association</h3>
<p>Soliciting Members in Two Weeks, Regular Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Northeast Association is a unified organization for rescuing the Northeast and studying the Northeast. Its purpose is to assist the soldiers fighting in the Northeast, investigate the current and past situation of the three eastern provinces, study the solution to the Northeast problem, and unite national organizations to jointly assist in exerting the perseverance and determination of the entire nation to solve the Northeast problem. At the beginning of its establishment, initiators Wu Tiecheng, Shi Liangcai, and others had clearly declared its purpose. Yesterday, all the directors of the association jointly declared, detailing the purpose of its establishment and the heavy responsibilities it bears, in order to awaken the people of the country to unite and carry out a total national mobilization to achieve its purpose. A Central News Agency reporter, in order to understand the current status of the association's planning and organization, visited the association's Secretary-General Zang Qifang, who gave him a detailed answer as follows:</p>
<h3>Two Important Tasks</h3>
<p>Zang told the reporter that the purpose of the establishment of the Northeast Association has been detailed in the declaration issued yesterday, and the people of the country should already understand it. What we are planning now is the work plan, the most important of which are two points: (1) How to enable the volunteer armies in the Northeast to fight together under unified leadership to respond to the national army; (2) To investigate the current situation of the three eastern provinces and the internal situation of the puppet organizations and Japan in order to study countermeasures. After Ma Zhanshan, Feng Zhanhai, Ding Chao, Li Du, and others successively left the country last year, the momentum of the Northeast Volunteer Army seemed to have subsided. However, in reality, no fewer than 200,000 people in the Northeast are waiting for orders, but they are hiding in the deep mountains to wait for an opportunity, either due to lack of leadership or because supplies have been cut off. Moreover, due to the strict investigation by the Japanese military police, domestic news cannot be conveyed there, so although they are ready, they do not yet know that the time to kill the enemy and serve the country has matured. Now that the great war on the border of Rehe has broken out, it is a good opportunity for the volunteer army to rise up in response and attack its rear. If the national army in Rehe Province can maintain it for three months, Japan's disastrous defeat will be within expectation. Even if Rehe Province unfortunately falls, the association's support for the volunteer army will not be reduced at all, because the effectiveness of the volunteer army fighting within its territory is greater than sending troops to recover the lost land. Therefore, on the one hand, the association must provide it with leadership and assistance, and on the other hand, it must transmit various messages to it, so that it can rise up in response at the right time.</p>
<h3>Soliciting Members in Two Weeks</h3>
<p>Continuing to talk about soliciting</p>
<p>members, Zang said that the</p>
<p>planning of the association's</p>
<p>affairs will be completed in</p>
<p>about two weeks, so the membership</p>
<p>solicitation period will not be too</p>
<p>far away. Since the association is a large group for rescuing the Northeast and solving the Northeast problem, it hopes that all compatriots in the country will be members. Mayor Wu once said that the Northeast problem must be deeply imprinted in the minds of all compatriots in the country, and vigilance must be maintained at all times, and even after the Northeast can be recovered, the important responsibility of Northeast construction must not be forgotten. However, human life is limited, and the Northeast problem may not be solved in a short period of time, so if the Northeast Association exists, even if it is passed down to our children and grandchildren, we must not forget the Northeast. As for its organization, it must be popularized throughout the country, and branch associations must be established in all places where members are located. Its internal organization will increase some special committees as needed. The Foreign Affairs Committee, which was decided at the last board meeting, has already started to be implemented, and will conduct detailed investigations and studies on international issues in the Northeast to contribute to the government for reference. Other committees, such as the Economic Committee and the General Staff Committee, will also be established in order to study various specialized problems.</p>
<h3>Regular Meeting Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Zang said at the end that the</p>
<p>association has scheduled to</p>
<p>hold its first regular board</p>
<p>meeting tomorrow (Monday)</p>
<p>at 4:30 p.m. at the</p>
<p>Municipal Government to discuss all ongoing matters. As for the address, it was originally planned to be attached to the China Aviation Association, but now because the association's premises are not sufficient, it has been separately located, and will be moved into the office after repairs.</p>
<h3>Tang Youren's Discussion of the Current Situation</h3>
<p>No Confirmation of Wang's Return</p>
<p>Regulations on the Senate to Be Discussed</p>
<p>Puppet Organization to Start Internal Change</p>
<p>Tang Youren, Secretary-General of the Central Political Council, came to Shanghai by car at eight o'clock yesterday. The reporter specially visited his residence and asked about the following matters. According to his reply,</p>
<h3>National Senate</h3>
<p>The principles of the National</p>
<p>Senate have been approved</p>
<p>by the Central Political Council,</p>
<p>but there are still many procedures,</p>
<p>and it will still be sent</p>
<p>to the Legislative Yuan for research.</p>
<h3>Wang's Return</h3>
<p>The date of the return of Premier Wang Jingwei</p>
<p>is expected to be around</p>
<p>March 15th.</p>
<p>Because there has been no telegram</p>
<p>recently, it is unknown</p>
<p>whether he will return by ship from Italy or Marseilles.</p>
<h3>Puppet Starting Internal Change</h3>
<p>According to recent news from</p>
<p>North China, the puppet</p>
<p>organization will temporarily</p>
<p>on March 9th, the first</p>
<p>anniversary of the puppet</p>
<p>ruler's inauguration,</p>
<p>decide to usurp the throne and declare himself emperor.</p>
<p>However, those around Puyi, such as Yuan Jinkai and Zheng Xiaoxu,</p>
<p>have many disagreements.</p>
<p>Because Zheng Xiaoxu recently felt that the Japanese</p>
<p>were seizing things at every turn,</p>
<p>he advised Puyi to use fewer Japanese.</p>
<p>The Japanese are therefore quite intent on removing Zheng.</p>
<p>It is observed that the puppet</p>
<p>organization will soon undergo internal changes.</p>
<h3>Recalling Ambassadors</h3>
<p>At this time, Sino-Japanese relations</p>
<p>have become a state</p>
<p>of neither harmony nor war,</p>
<p>but also both harmony and war.</p>
<p>And completely to a factual</p>
<p>issue, that is, if they come to attack us, we will resist.</p>
<p>If we recall the Japanese ambassador at this time,</p>
<p>it would only disrupt the steps of the League of Nations' work,</p>
<p>so it has not yet been realized.</p>
<h3>Japan Withdraws from League of Nations</h3>
<p>Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations,</p>
<p>in view of the room for maneuver</p>
<p>given to Japan by the League of Nations' report,</p>
<p>and the various internal</p>
<p>problems in Japan,</p>
<p>Japan is still reluctant to be completely unconcerned</p>
<p>about the League of Nations</p>
<p>and withdraw immediately.</p>
<p>Therefore, whether Japan will withdraw from the League of Nations</p>
<p>must be observed after March to see what will happen.</p>
<p>It is extremely difficult to say at this time.</p>
<h3>Ma Kui Telegraphed Wu Tiecheng Yesterday</h3>
<p>Reporting His Appointment as Commander of the Tenth Brigade in Rehe Lingsi</p>
<p>Ma Kui, the son of General Ma Zhanshan, led a team of twenty anti-Japanese personnel from Shanghai to Rehe last month and has now arrived in Lingsi. Due to the death of Han, the commander of the Tenth Brigade of the Black Army, Ma was appointed to succeed him and has already taken office. Yesterday, he telegraphed Wu Huanzhang, the representative of General Ma in Shanghai, from Lingsi to Mayor Wu Tiecheng of this city. The original telegram is transcribed below: "Wu Huanzhang, brother, to Mayor Wu Tiecheng, Mr., and all comrades in Guangdong and Nanyang, may it come to your attention: Kui is indignant that Yuguan was not defended and that the enemy bandits are becoming increasingly deep. He rushed to Lingsi to participate in military affairs. He originally planned to establish a training team from his father's old troops to carry out basic training in order to achieve the initial intention of long-term resistance against Japan. However, due to the death of Han, the commander of the Tenth Brigade, due to overwork, Commander Shao Weicen appointed him, disregarding his inadequacy, and urging him to act with a great sense of saving the country. After the soldiers surrounded him and begged him, and his colleagues encouraged him, Kui could not refuse. Thinking that the country is in distress, modesty and evasion cannot save the situation. The will is to kill the enemy, and only perseverance can succeed. Therefore, on the day of respect, he resolutely took office. However, he is inexperienced and the responsibility is heavy, and he is deeply afraid that he will not be able to overcome. He hopes that you, Mr., will consider the difficulties of the time and give him words of encouragement, and also introduce military and political talents to give Kui spiritual assistance. The telegram is urgent and cannot express all that he wants to say. Ma Kui bows in respect."</p>
<h3>Shao Lizi Leaves Shanghai Tonight to Return to His Hometown</h3>
<p>To Bury His Late Mother and Rest</p>
<p>He Will Come to Shanghai Again to Discuss the Development of the Northwest</p>
<p>Shao Lizi, Chairman of the Gansu Provincial Government, came to Shanghai a few days ago and is scheduled to take a night train to Hangzhou tonight (the 26th) and return to his hometown of Shaoxing to bury his late mother and rest. Shao is scheduled to come to Shanghai as soon as he is in better health to meet with leaders of the financial and industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai, report on the real situation in the Northwest, and ask them to go to the Northwest to promote development.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Railways to Issue Yuehan Railway Bonds</h3>
<p>In order to complete the Yuehan Railway, the Ministry of Railways requested the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee to issue bonds worth 1.2 million pounds. After repeated discussions by the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee and the approval of the guarantee issue, it is now known that it can be implemented soon. This debt will be issued domestically, but before it is issued, it must be discussed by the Boxer Indemnity Committee. The Boxer Indemnity Committee will convene a meeting after receiving a letter from the Railway Department. It will be converted into Chinese currency for issuance in the future.</p>
<h3>Government Determined to Reform the Currency System</h3>
<p>Preparation for Bimetallism to Start on March 1st</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association Specially Held a General Meeting to Discuss It Yesterday</p>
<p>To Be Announced After Passed by the Central Political Council on the 28th</p>
<p>Since last year, the Ministry of Finance has organized a committee to specialize in research and planning for the implementation of currency reform and the abolition of silver and the adoption of the yuan. In early February, Finance Minister Song Ziwen and leaders of the silver and money industry agreed to start bimetallism on March 1st, and to completely abolish the silver system by July 1st. Leaders of the money industry, Yu Zuoting and Qin Qiqing, told a reporter from the New Sound Agency this morning that Finance Minister Song had talked to the leaders of the money industry about the Ministry of Finance's determination to reform the currency system, and the preparations and opinions of the money industry. At 3 p.m. yesterday, the money industry held a meeting of member representatives to discuss and decide on various matters, which are recorded separately below.</p>
<h3>Government Resolution</h3>
<p>Finance Minister Song Ziwen in Shanghai</p>
<p>On the 23rd, he met with leaders of the money industry, expressing the Ministry of Finance's determination to reorganize the currency system. Abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan must be implemented. The money industry also deeply understands the government's painstaking efforts and is determined to comply as scheduled. The period for both taels and yuan to be used concurrently is confirmed as March 1st, which must be submitted for approval at the Central Political Conference on the 28th of this month before being officially announced by the National Government.</p>
<h3>Raw Silver Loan</h3>
<p>The draft currency system regulations has also been</p>
<p>completed by the Ministry of Finance and will be submitted to the Central Political Conference on the 28th for approval and then submitted to the Legislative Yuan for discussion, approval, and promulgation. The Ministry of Finance is still in the process of securing a currency system loan of 500 million ounces of raw silver from the United States to reorganize the currency system and mint new coins.</p>
<h3>Three Banks' Regulation</h3>
<p>Starting next month, the concurrent use of taels and yuan</p>
<p>will be implemented, with the exchange rate set at 71.5. Subsequently, the exchange rate for foreign cents will no longer fluctuate daily. However, foreign banks still use silver taels as their standard, so foreign trade still requires the use of silver taels. The former exchange rate for foreign cents, which fluctuated based on supply and demand, will be abolished, and the Central Bank of China, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications will be responsible for regulation. Merchants who need silver taels can purchase them from the aforementioned three banks at the official exchange rate. However, if silver yuan are insufficient, silver taels can be minted. If silver taels are insufficient and silver yuan are used for reminting, there will be a loss of 1-2%. The Ministry of Finance has prepared to compensate for this loss.</p>
<h3>Increased Foreign Exchange</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the Money Industry</p>
<p>Association held a members' representative meeting and resolved that, starting from March 1st, in addition to the existing silver exchange, a foreign exchange would be added. The silver and foreign currencies will continue to exist concurrently on their respective standards. The implementation of a unified silver-yuan exchange rate will await the government's official announcement before it is dispersed. It is expected that starting from July 1st, the silver tael standard will be abolished, and all will be converted to silver yuan.</p>
<h3>Two Industries' Opinions</h3>
<p>Regarding the opinions of the silver and money industries on abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan,</p>
<p>the banking industry naturally expresses strong support. The money industry is quite concerned about whether silver yuan will be sufficient for application, and whether the minting capacity of the Central Mint can meet the needs of social finance. Actual experience will only be gained after a trial period. If there are no major obstacles, they will also agree.</p>
<h3>Three New Managers Sheng Yun Appeal Acquittal</h3>
<p>Managerial Remuneration Distribution Right to Discretion</p>
<p>Former manager of the Three New Cotton Mill, Sheng Yu Yun, sold scrap copper, etc. when the mill was sold, and instructed the general manager Sun He Cai to distribute 30,000 yuan to various employees as remuneration. Later, due to uneven distribution, a case arose in which the mill's employees Yu He Sheng, Yu Guo Xiang, and Chen Zhu sued Sheng for embezzlement in the First Special Court. The trial result considered Sheng to be suspected of breach of trust and sentenced him to a fine of 300 yuan. Sheng did not accept the judgment and appealed to the Second Branch of the High Court, which overturned the original judgment and declared him not guilty. This case is of great importance regarding the method of managers distributing employee remuneration in the business community. Here, we specially select and record the reasoning for the judgment of the First Branch of the High Court, copied below: The old iron and scrap copper owned by the Three New Textile Company in this case were sold entirely by the mill's general manager, Sun He Cai, and the sales price obtained, except for one account of Zhu Dao Ji, which had a small difference of one cent compared to the amount received in the bill, was consistent with the number of accounts received and distributed, as confirmed by the original auditor. In the report, regarding the expenditure section, although receipts were not obtained for payments to Chen Zhu Ting, Yu He Sheng, Yu Zi Sheng, Gu Yong Lan, Shao Chang Chun, Sun Yi, etc., Sun He Cai explained in the original trial the reasons why receipts could not be obtained. Chen Zhu Ting did not deny that he received 48 yuan of first-class money, and Yu Zi Sheng also stated that he received 200 yuan and 550 yuan, and that there were no receipts. Therefore, it is difficult to say that the various payments made by Sun without receipts were false. Even if there are inaccuracies, the sale of waste materials and the receipt and disbursement of money were handled by Sun alone and have nothing to do with Sheng Yu Yun. This point was also clearly admitted by Yu Guo Xiang. At most, it can only be said that Sheng Yu Yun did not fully exercise his supervisory duties. How can it be considered joint embezzlement or breach of trust? Moreover, since the appellants withdrew the part of the lawsuit against Sun He Cai and did not want to investigate further, they instead requested relief from the Social Affairs Bureau for Sheng Yu Yun, who was suspected of a lesser offense, and then filed a lawsuit with the original trial. After the judgment, they also appealed because the sentence was too light. What is their intention? It is even more difficult to understand. Furthermore, Sheng Yu Yun approved 2,000 yuan of foreign currency to Sun He Cai and distributed the remaining 861 yuan and 17 cents. Sun's remuneration was indeed much higher than that of other employees, but he held the position of general manager, and his seniority was also deeper than that of other employees. This time, he was able to recover the sales price of the waste materials that the mill had already sold, which helped the old employees, all because of Sun's negotiations with the buyer, as evidenced by Wu Kun Sheng's reply letter. Sheng Yu Yun, as the manager, did not want to share in the profits himself and gave 2,000 yuan to Sun He Cai, who had made special contributions, and distributed the remaining money to him as remuneration. It cannot be said that it was not fair and reasonable. According to a survey by the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the manager has the right to discretion in the distribution of employee remuneration, which is a common practice in commercial affairs, and there is no criminal suspicion whatsoever. The original judgment used this point as the basis for convicting Sheng Yu Yun of breach of trust, which is a mistake. Based on the above conclusions, the defendant's appeal in this case is justified, and although the appellants' appeal is not justified, part of the original judgment is also inappropriate. That part is revoked, and the defendant Sheng Yu Yun should be acquitted in accordance with Articles 379, 357, and 316 of the Criminal Procedure Law, and the judgment should be made in accordance with Article 385, Paragraph 1 of the same law. Presiding Judge Yu Hua, Judges Zhao Zheng Tang, Zhou Han.</p>

<h3>The Final Resistance</h3>
<p>— Duo Fei</p>
<p>Japanese imperialists are occupying our Manchuria with brutal force, bombing our Shanghai, coveting our Rehe, and recently advancing into Guannei, capturing our Shanhaiguan and Jiunmenkou, and threatening our Tianjin and Beijing; making all our people deeply feel that national demise is imminent, and everyone must unite and rise up to make a final and desperate resistance against our strong enemy.</p>
<p>What should we shop assistants do in this critical situation?</p>
<p>Some people say: "We shop assistants are suffering from economic oppression, and are struggling hard for our personal lives. No one cares about the rise and fall of the nation." You must know that when the country is truly lost and we become subjugated people, even if we can live in shame and humiliation, such a life is meaningless. It would be better to die happily!</p>
<p>Someone asks: "The Jewish people have no country, but they still live in the world, don't they?" You must know that the Jewish people are the most intelligent people in the world. Because they have no country and cannot get national protection, they are envied and persecuted everywhere in the world. Now they want to restore their country, but they cannot. Before the world reaches the Datong (Great Harmony), the country is the group where our nation entrusts its life, and we must never allow others to infringe upon it, and we must swear to protect it to the death. Because China lacks organization and does not know how to unite, the nation is still despised and abused everywhere. If even the country is lost, then the suffering of our Chinese nation in the future will be many times greater than that of the Jewish people! The Koreans and Indians of today are a great mirror for us Chinese.</p>
<p>Someone asks: "We shop assistants have no strength or courage. How can we love the country? How can we resist Japan?" You must know that resisting Japan does not mean that everyone in the country should carry a gun to the front line to fight. As long as everyone does their best within the scope of their ability, that's enough. "Boycotting Japanese goods" is a tactic that we shop assistants can do. If everyone does not buy or sell Japanese goods, it can greatly打击 Japanese imperialists' commerce and increase economic panic,促成 their imperialism's own collapse and demise.</p>
<p>Someone asks: "We can manage not to buy Japanese goods ourselves, but if our shop owners are greedy for profits and secretly import Japanese goods, and we shop assistants object and refuse to sell them, won't we be fired?" You must know that the phrase "do not buy Japanese goods" is not just a matter of saying it, but must be put into practice! If we buy one piece of Japanese goods, it is tantamount to giving the enemy some money to make more bullets and kill more of our soldiers on the front line. If the shop owner is greedy for profits and forgets morality and secretly imports Japanese goods, it will not succeed without our shop assistants helping him to do evil. If we and our fellow shop assistants do not help him do this treacherous deed, the shop owner can't do anything to us, and he will never dare to fire us for this reason. If we find out that he has this shameless behavior of secretly importing Japanese goods, we can send a secret letter to the organs responsible for sanctions, so that he has no way to use his tricks. This is the lowest minimum method for us shop assistants to love the country and resist Japan. If you still say that you can't do it, then I'm sorry! Prepare to be a subjugated people! Prepare to be a subjugated people of Japanese imperialists! Prepare your children and grandchildren to be subjugated people of Japanese imperialists forever!</p>

<h3>The Life of a Small Bank Clerk Snorting Among Banknotes</h3>
<p>[When counting banknotes,] treat it as a snack. This is not a game. Each bill is five or ten yuan. If the amount is wrong, you have no say, you have to pay out of your own pocket. The first time you do this, you have to be extra careful." Old Wu told him.</p>
<p>"What are you afraid of? I don't intend to steal, how can the number be wrong?" He raised his head and answered, and followed Old Wu into the banknote room with a straight body. The banknote room was on the basement floor, surrounded by gray-white terrazzo. Except for three or four small iron windows, half exposed above the ground, the rest was dark and could not get a ray of light. The electric light shone brightly. On the damp floor, white wooden boxes squatted quietly one by one. Red and green banknotes were tightly bound with hemp rope, bundle after bundle like bundles of straw paper. Stacked on the table, you couldn't see the person opposite.</p>
<p>"So many!" He couldn't help but shout.</p>
<p>"This can be considered a lot. You haven't seen the banknote boxes in the vault, stacked on top of each other, like matchboxes in a杂货舖." Old Wu patted his shoulder with a smile and said.</p>
<p>"Damn it!" He said angrily in a low voice, as if expressing extreme injustice. "Poor people open their eyes wide like copper bells, and can't even get one bill all year round…"</p>
<p>"Say less!" Old Wu pulled his collar, and he didn't speak. They walked into another room, where several desks were placed horizontally and vertically. He sat down opposite Old Wu's desk. The things on the table were very simple: a pair of scissors, a glue jar, a few bundles of hemp rope, a green water pot with a sponge, and dozens of small white papers like tofu cubes. According to Old Wu, these were all the tools used when counting banknotes.</p>
<p>"Be careful when counting, this is 10,000 yuan in full." Old Wu handed over a banknote and instructed him, "After you count it, stack it in bundles of 5,000, tie it tightly with hemp rope, stick a square piece of paper on the knot, sign your name, and you will be responsible for the amount of this bundle of banknotes."</p>
<p>"I know." He answered, then cut the hemp rope with scissors, took out a stack, held the corners of the banknotes with both hands, and counted them rustlingly. He was very careful, because the hard banknotes were slippery to count. After counting one hundred, he wondered if there was one missing, so he took it over and counted it again.</p>
<p>"Slowly, the banknotes are slippery, you can dip some water before counting." Old Wu raised his head and said, "Counting banknotes is not easy! We are fine, we are already skilled at counting, we can count even with our eyes closed. Not to mention, how many tens of millions of banknotes have we counted?" As he said, a smug smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>"Tens of millions?"</p>
<p>"This is not bragging to you, tens of millions are enough, but it's always someone else's. After counting until now, I only made my fingers thick and big. I often think, if I have nothing to do in the future, I'll go back and count straw paper." Old Wu was a little emotional.</p>
<p>He had counted four thousand, and there were still several stacks of uncounted on the table. He didn't know how many more there were. He only felt that there were more and more of them. At the same time, the air was suffocating, and his breathing was a little rapid. He couldn't take a breath of fresh air. However, the nauseating musty smell, mixed with the fermented smell of glue, was still constantly being sent into his nostrils. It was as if a lead cake was pressing on his heart, gradually becoming heavier! His brain was also swelling. He regretted coming here. He thought that a man should stand in a bright and upright place and do something refreshing. But now he was hiding in this dark banknote room, unable to breathe even a little free air, it was too suffocating! "Damn it," who is patient enough to do this unpromising thing! He cursed secretly. He really wanted to drop the banknotes and quit, but that would break his rice bowl. Old Wu, who was sitting in front of him, seemed to know his thoughts, so he sighed and said to him: "Eating this bowl of rice is not just suffering, but also being worried all day long. A little carelessness will cost you money. Sometimes, even if you count carefully yourself, others will accuse you, saying that so and so much is missing from the banknotes you handled. Losing money is nothing, but you will also get a bad name. But we know the suffering here, and we are still willing to do this. It seems that we don't care about missing banknotes, losing money, or bad reputation. You will be the same as me if you work here for a long time. Aren't there many students who graduated from your school who come here? Some people would rather not study, and want to cross this threshold, but can't cross it. Everyone wants to come to the bank to make a fortune... make a fortune... make a fortune... Of course, there are also those who make a fortune, but only…"</p>
<p>He felt that Old Wu's words were very good, and he himself had come with this kind of thinking. He heard those</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>People who have earned some money in the bank say that the bank is such a good place, there are almost 洋錢鈔票 everywhere, you eat well, and there are also bonuses at the end of the year. As long as you are honest and hardworking, you can definitely be promoted to teller, director, and manager step by step, and you will have a very good future. This kind of rumor grabbed the heart of his aging mother, so she persuaded him, and made him also dream of making a fortune. But what exactly is the benefit that others talk about? The job he was doing was only a four-yuan-a-month trainee, squatting in this stuffy room counting banknotes all day long. Others had never told him this before, and he was now starting to doubt it.</p>
<p>"What's wrong? You can't count anymore!" Old Wu asked him in surprise: "Dinner is coming soon, count quickly, don't waste any more time."</p>
<p>Hearing Old Wu's words, he was startled, as if he had just woken up from a dream. He didn't answer, and didn't think anymore, and continued to count.</p>
<p>After dinner, they continued to count banknotes, and their hands and feet were very fast. He understood that this was the result of his first job, and it was also the beginning of his future. He thought, if his two hands turned into a living machine, then banknotes would fly out of his hands like a general, and hundreds of thousands, or even a box, could be counted quickly in a day. In this way, his dream would come true. Raise salary, promote to director, promote to manager, golden rays of light floated before his eyes. Count! Count! An unstoppable desire shouted in his chest. He felt that his whole body was activated. He rolled up his sleeves, took a stack of banknotes in his hands, and counted them one by one. He was sweating from counting, but he still kept counting.</p>
<p>"Count slowly, it's easy to be wrong if you go too fast." Old Wu called to him from across the room. So he stopped and turned to look at Old Wu. Old Wu still had his head down. The thin face where you could see the cheekbones, was covered with blue veins, all trembling slightly.</p>
<p>"You have this little bit left? You count so fast!" Old Wu asked him with a smile. He nodded with a smile.</p>
<p>"If you work so hard, you may be promoted quickly in the future. But that's how it is here, the ones with big backgrounds, the ones who flatter well, get a salary increase of dozens of dollars at once. The ones who bury their heads in their work without saying a word get at most four洋. I have been working here for almost ten years, and I only have twenty-odd yuan in salary. May I ask, how can I maintain such a high cost of living, with a large family and often being sick? I have no other choice, otherwise, I would not be willing to be here." Old Wu's words were simply a basin of cold water, extinguishing the flames of his desire.</p>
<p>"Really?" He asked in fear.</p>
<p>"What am I lying to you for? I'll tell you, there's another thing that's sad to talk about. There used to be an Old Zhang here, who was already in his twenties. When he came, he was also a four-dollar trainee, counting banknotes here. He was very honest. One time, he was careless, and the banknotes he was given didn't add up to the right number. When he counted them at night, he was short a thousand. The manager told him to pay it back, and if he didn't pay it back, he would be fired and he would have to take out the money to pay it back. He desperately scraped together a few hundred yuan at home, so he wasn't fired. He often told people that he had been wronged to death, and he couldn't say anything about it. He was willing to pay off the money and quit, even if he had to beg for a living. He later worked really hard, using his dinner money, not eating, gnawing on sesame cakes, and washing his own clothes. When he came, he had a smiling, white and fat face, but later he became much thinner and yellow, and he got the disease of spitting blood. Last year, he finally paid off the money and returned to his hometown. I don't know what happened to him later, but someone said that he was dead…"</p>
<p>At this time, his mood had changed. The previous hope had disappeared. On the one hand, physical fatigue, and on the other hand, Old Wu's words deprived him of his fantasies. Regardless of whether Old Wu was joking with him, Old Wu himself was an example. Did he make a fortune? Did he get promoted to manager? Not at all. After ten years of hard work, the result was a body with the symptoms of tuberculosis. Would he get the same result as Old Wu in the future? Who can say no? Thinking of this, he felt more and more uneasy in his heart. Sadness and terror occupied his mind, and his mind was confused, reflecting scene after scene: "Banknote room... missing banknotes... losing money... bad reputation... dismissal... getting tuberculosis... grave..." He felt that the future was full of danger, and he was terrified. He had no energy to count the remaining hundreds of banknotes on the table. It was still Old Wu calling to him from across the room: "Don't be in a daze, it's getting late, let's get back to work!" His mind became clear, and he lowered his head.</p>

<h3>What Novels Should You Read?</h3>
<p>— Father</p>
<p>Put aside "Jianghu Knight Errant" and "The Smiling, Proud Wanderer,"</p>
<p>Read books like "The Trilogy" and "The Iron Flood"!</p>
<p>Shop assistants often pick up a novel to pass the time when they are free. Among these recreational readings, according to my recent findings, "Jianghu Knight Errant" and "The Smiling, Proud Wanderer" are the most popular.</p>
<p>The reason why shop assistants like to read "Jianghu Knight Errant" and "The Smiling, Proud Wanderer" is the same reason why petty citizens like to watch horror movies with animal scenes, that is, "escaping reality."</p>
<p>Shop assistants belong to the petty bourgeoisie of society. The petty bourgeoisie is fundamentally a shaky and uneasy class. Of course, there are very few who can be lucky enough to climb to a high level and become a true bourgeoisie, but most are still shaky, uneasy, bitter, and without a way out, and finally disillusioned and declined!</p>
<p>We who are shaky, uneasy, bitter, and without a way out, especially those of us who are born in modern China, because of various other reasons, are even more dissatisfied with reality, and the mood of bitterness and helplessness is particularly high. As a result, we go to books that are 180,000 miles away from actual life and years away from the times to find another world, a moment of illusion and an inexplicable rose-colored dream. Therefore, "Jianghu Knight Errant" and "The Smiling, Proud Wanderer" are very popular.</p>
<p>But what exactly do these books give us? That is nothing more than the sadness after the illusion and the nightmare after the dream.</p>

<h3>Could Automatic Machines Replace Shop Assistants?</h3>
<p>— Zu Tong</p>
<p>Recently, automatic machines have been innovated in many ways. Some dispense a piece of candy for a penny, while others dispense a one-cent postage stamp for a one-cent coin. Scholars who are fascinated by machines have proposed installing automatic machines in various shops to replace shop assistants. This kind of prejudice is understandable if shop assistants can only handle straightforward transactions. In that case, it is more economical to use machines than to hire shop assistants. However, not all transactions are as simple as selling candy and postage stamps, so shop assistants cannot be entirely abolished and still have a value that should be maintained. I will now elaborate on the reasons below:</p>
<p>(1) Guiding Customers: Customers may not fully understand the application of various goods in a shop. It is difficult to understand the underlying meaning without the repeated explanation of shop assistants. There is a Western saying: [Shopkeepers are the guides of the people, and the standard of living is promoted through them.] This is indeed a meaningful statement!</p>
<p>(2) Rooted in Habit: Customers enter the shop and see shop assistants, talk about transactions, and interact with each other. This has been a long-standing habit. Therefore, replacing shop assistants with machines is practically impossible.</p>
<p>(3) Selling Goods: Many goods cannot be sold by themselves. For example, insurance, sewing machines, and musical instruments, etc., cannot be sold without the promotion of shop assistants. When competition arises, it depends even more on the selling ability of shop assistants. Some people regard salesmen as commercial envoys, so the importance of shop assistants can be imagined!</p>
<p>(4) Increasing Prices: The value of goods often needs to be increased through good salesmanship. Shop assistants put in a lot of effort, and customers also find many uses for the goods, so they do not consider the increased price to be excessive.</p>
<p>(5) Attracting Customers: Good shop assistants have the ability to retain old customers and attract new ones. The shop's business depends entirely on maintaining this, making them indispensable talents for the time being. All that is left is despair, and the most is [boredom].</p>
<p>Therefore, we must immediately discard them and find readings that can shout out our bitterness, express our suffering, and provide us with solutions. Here, I will temporarily take Mao Dun's "Trilogy" and the foreign product "The Iron Flood" as representatives.</p>
<p>Mao Dun's "Trilogy" fully expresses the anxiety and decline of the petty bourgeoisie, and can indeed represent our voice, but unfortunately it is only [just that] and still has no way out and no solutions.</p>
<p>"The Iron Flood" is a foreign novel, and there is also a Chinese translation. This book is full of [power], [motion], and [struggle]. Its revelation is: [Struggle can survive,] An complacency is destruction. A group of people seeking survival are moving forward like iron, which is exactly a broad road for our survival.</p>
<p>Let's change the taste, I pray like this.</p>

<h3>Speaking Out Against Injustice</h3>
<p>— HCY</p>
<p>The Ratio of Two and Twenty: Is Justice Just?</p>
<p>I am a person who already has a job! Secretary of the XX Small Newspaper. Originally, in this year of oversupply of manpower, it is already very lucky to have a job; if you want to find another position, it seems inevitable to hope too much! But please forgive me, because the treatment I am receiving now is really too unfair.</p>
<p>I am from Haining, and I didn't know the XX Small Newspaper, but because I repeatedly contributed to the newspaper between last summer and autumn, I later wrote to the museum in a self-recommendation way to seek a position. Mr. Gongzheng, the manager, did not abandon me and ordered me to come to Shanghai, so I came to Shanghai to serve as a secretary. But the monthly salary is only one yuan, I still tolerate it first, thinking that the future may be hopeful; unexpectedly, it was not until this year that it increased by one yuan, and Secretary X, who does less than half of my work, has a monthly salary of twenty yuan, which inevitably makes me very disappointed and I have to make other plans.</p>
<p>I am seventeen years old this year and have a middle school education. My Chinese is still fluent and I can write essays of six or seven hundred words; I can read ordinary books and newspapers in English, and I am currently studying [Rhetoric and Composition] and [Advanced Translation] in the English Department of the Commercial Press Correspondence School. I am physically strong, do not smoke or drink; I can endure hardship and work hard.</p>
<p>The desired job is: a trainee in a company or a clerk in a commercial organization, or temporarily a trainee nature that can be promoted soon. As for the treatment, the minimum requirement must be able to provide food and accommodation and five or six yuan of pocket money per month (this refers to the temporary training period). Please forward correspondence to this publication.</p>
<h3>Please Note, Unemployed Friends</h3>
<p>Mr. Zheng Xingjian wrote a letter saying that he will make a considerable contribution to [general unemployment]. If you want to know the details, please attach two cents of postage and send a letter to No. 103, Lane 546, Tiantong Road to inquire.</p>

<p>Liangchen Hao You She, located at the intersection of Beijing Road and Zhejiang Road in this city, now wants to add five printing workers, paying based on the number of products produced. Any unemployed printing workers who are accustomed to using foot-operated small printing presses, are physically strong and hardworking, and have a certificate of good conduct from the previous employer, or can provide a guarantor from this city, can personally visit the society between 2 pm and 6 pm every day to discuss a trial job.</p>

<h3>A Small Boat Heavily Loaded</h3>
<p>— Zhu Zengwei</p>
<p>Editor: Since your column was born, I have often seen apprentices in many shops saying that the boss or manager only knows how to call them as errand boys, and they have no opportunity to learn any practical business experience; this will of course disappoint them. But my situation is very different. I am only seventeen years old this year. Last September, I was introduced by relatives and friends to work in a yarn shop in this city. Half because I am a person who has already graduated from junior high school, and I can cope with ordinary writing and calculations, and I am not very stupid by nature, and I can learn everything; but half is also because my guarantor is very reliable; therefore, I am grateful to the boss for his excessive reuse. Less than a month after entering the shop, he taught me how to help with the accounts; later, the actual accounting officer, because his wife died, asked for leave to return to his hometown, and he honestly and rudely called me to act as his agent. Until the time of the big settlement, this actual accounting officer came to cancel his leave; in total, I acted as the accounting officer for about three months. During this period, partly because the boss was always by my side, and my colleagues did not dare to make things difficult for me; and partly because everything had the original accounting officer, who set up a scale, and I followed Xiao Gui Cao Sui, so there was no difficulty; so there were no mistakes. Now the boss has established a branch in another city, and the staff inside include newly arrived ones and those sent from the old shop; I, in fact, have been sent to be the accountant of the branch. The scale of the branch is certainly different from the main store, how can I handle it? My colleagues see that I am young and ignorant, and the boss is not by my side, so it is difficult to guarantee that they will not deliberately make things difficult. The accountant of the branch has a very high status and has full power; but the responsibility is also very serious, and I am the only one who will be asked. So I politely declined to the boss, so that I could learn for a few more years in front of the boss. Who knows, the old man did not think so, saying that I was unwilling to serve him because of the meager salary (five yuan per month), and I held a grudge. Ah! This is really unheard of! I am a student, and I am flattered to have five yuan income every month, how dare I complain? But a small boat is heavily loaded, and I really can't believe in myself! Is it better not to go, or is it better to go? Please, enlightened editor, make a decision for me. (To be continued) Zhu Zengwei respectfully submitted</p>
<p>Editor's note: It is certainly regrettable to use great talent for small things; but a small boat heavily loaded will inevitably capsize, which is very dangerous. Although Mr. Zhu said that he has a foundation in safe writing and calculation, his experience in the business world is too poor. In the main store, because there was a boss to guide him, he was fortunate not to fall, but now he is called to stand alone, how can that be possible? Fortunately, Mr. Zhu is self-aware and is not moved by vanity, which is indeed where he is superior. I hope he can be cautious to the end, and the boss will not stop his business because of this. At the same time, I hope his boss will allow Mr. Zhu's request and select capable personnel to handle the affairs of this branch. Then, not only can Mr. Zhu progress step by step and not have the danger of climbing high and falling hard, but the future of the branch is also more promising. If you insist on forcing Mr. Zhu to go and work hard, then Mr. Zhu will inevitably be sacrificed; although the guarantor is indeed reliable, I am afraid that he can be fully responsible for the boss's improper deployment.</p>
<p>Editor's Notes</p>
<h3>The Dancing of Hands</h3>
<p>The era is roaring, the whole world</p>
<p>is in a storm.</p>
<p>Every day, every day, I see many hands trembling and stretching out in front of me.</p>
<p>Those are not hands that stretch out for money and seek leisure without labor; nor are they hands that hold champagne glasses and play golf; nor are they lewd hands that live in grand hotels and make [night pilgrimages] on women's legs; alas! pitiful! Those are dry, trembling, gray-white, malnourished, cowardly hands! [Editor, please publish my manuscript in the self-introduction for job seeking column! I have been unemployed for a long time!] These hand brothers and sisters often say to me, with a pleading tone.</p>
<p>But please forgive me, forgive me, all you hardworking hands! Although I have disclosed your manuscripts, what can I do to help you? What does this dying society give you, except to put hunger, pain, oppression, and death in your hands? Among these hundreds of hands, I am afraid that less than one percent can find a job by luck through the power of newspapers! The rest are still idle, so empty as if they have lost something precious? Fortunately, what I can see and touch is only these hundreds of hands: if I add the hands of 30 million unemployed workers and hundreds of millions of other unemployed people in the world, I am afraid my eyes will be blinded! Every day, every day, I see many hands trembling and waving in front of me.</p>
<p>Pitiful! They are just getting smaller and smaller day by day, and are almost climbing to the hunger line! Sometimes, I really want to hold them and shed a tear of sympathy, but sometimes, I get angry.</p>
<p>[You stupid hands, haven't you turned over the map, don't you know that there is a country on this earth without unemployment, and there is still a shortage of millions of workers?] I think, but the great laws and religions are pressing on my head, I am afraid! I am afraid! Finally, I did not say it. I can only learn from the tone of imperialism and shout loudly: [The Soviet Union is a country of forced labor], don't believe it!]</p>
<p>Good [superiors] of the world! Please release some compassion and save these hands and ladies, help [hands]! Help [hands]! Look, they are not resisting you; they are the most docile, as if they have never clenched their fists, never returned hand for hand, and never [overthrown] anyone; they have long put aside all the oppression and pain they have suffered, and completely forgotten it! All cannons, airplanes, machine guns, and shrapnel are simply useless to them. They are just begging! Begging! Now, they are all quietly lying still on my desk, they will not [rebel], let alone [riot]. Look, how gentle they are, how lovely they are! But they are so small, so pitiful! Quick! Quick! Help [hands]! Help [hands]! Give them rice bowls! Oh, oh, look, look, one is already dead!</p>
<p>[Editor, my friend Mr. Zhihui sent a manuscript, which was published in the self-introduction for job seeking column, I am very grateful! But I have not received a reply for a long time, and I am very anxious. Now he suddenly committed suicide by jumping into the river the night before...]</p>
<p>Strangely enough, this world seems to only need those fat hands plated with gold.</p>
<p>Turn your hands! Turn your hands! Put your hands back! Put your hands back! Connect hands tightly with each other! All hardworking friends, please! please! please!</p>
<p>The era is roaring, the whole world is in a storm. (Editor)</p>
