<h3 id="c21">華盛頓爐邊談話與遠東信 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>英國内閣總理將西渡大西洋。爲白宫上賓。就商世界經濟之如何恢復。間接謀英美兩國之諒解。現在法國前内閣首揆亦將同時赴美。三巨頭將在白宫爐邊。暢論世界問題。希望在世界經濟會議開幕之前。得一較爲具體以解决當前困難之答案。被邀列席者。英法之外。尚有德意中日加拿大等九國。而未邀請者尚有四十餘國。不過此次會議。大槪屬於談話形式而非嚴正的圓桌會議。且會中主角。厥爲英美法意德五國。英美法尤爲其中之主腦。會談結果。吾人不必於事先多所推測。惟據一般情形觀察。不難揣知其内含意義爲何如也。</p>
<p>被邀請國家固已十有一國。現世界主要國家。殆皆羅列。惟缺至今未與美國恢復尋常國交之蘇聯。在歐洲亦未有波蘭以下各小國。則資本主義國與社會主義國之對立。將日益深刻外。大國與小國間。民族同異間。亦將發生巨大裂痕。今後歐洲政局。恐愈將糾纏不淸。國際危機。愈不可彌補。此華府爐邊談話之第一重難關也。</p>
<p>英美兩國。早已形成對立。至少亦可謂爲不調和。就遠東市塲而論。英國對華輸出之半數爲棉毛紡織物品。但多屬於高級物産。故我國紡織業雖漸發達。而現時與英國貨品。却少衝突。（再過一階段則又當别論）其他則爲金屬商品及機械化學工業。此則爲北美合衆國最大之競爭者。欲使調和。殊非易事。此爐邊談話之第二理難關也。</p>
<p>金融資本爲近世支配世界之惟一重心。美國據現世界金融王座。縱因金融恐慌而有動搖之勢。然其天賦甚厚。實力仍强。即戰債一項。已足以壓倒英國而有餘。在南北美洲。北美合。衆國固占優勢。即在遠東。美國勞力。亦將逐漸膨脹。目下誠遠不如英帝國。但計及將來。豈能無所顧忌。此爐邊談話之第三重難關也。</p>
<p>此外更有甚者。在表面上似僅屬於局部問題。而所爭者又爲民族之興衰。於世界經濟。似少直接的明顯的關係。然其實甚爲重要。同時彼侵略者反以爲彼之軍事行動。係謀世界之安全。圖東亞之和平。更明白言之曰防禦蘇聯是也。此種行動。英國固默認之。法國亦具相對諒解。皆以爲日本或可爲資本主義之忠臣。殊不知日本自身。不過借此作面具。其惟一目的。乃在挑動對外戰爭。以軍需工業。剌激其國内産業界之疲敝。且以爲占領吉黑擴大南滿路營業範圍。即足以减輕其經濟恐慌。打破其所謂國難。而事實乃大謬不然。經濟恐慌愈加深刻。日本帝國主義遂奮其蠻力。併吞吉黑。西陷錦州。以爲東北三省旣得。則自鑛藏以至於農産。今後均有確實來源。日本之經濟危機。從此可以消滅。豈知非特不能獲效。且使日本之危機愈見增大。於是更借口國境安全。進攻熱河。今者熱河已陷於日人之手。似乎不犯長城以南之宣言。最少在短時期内可以實踐。然熱河旣得。仍無濟於日本之恐慌。反增加日本軍國主義之熱病。是以林西屯兵以窺伺多倫。冷口襲擊而擾亂灤東。竊恐危機之迫切。尚不止此耳。</p>
<p>遠東燎原之火。已延燒四省。列國縱欲力持鎭靜。否定戰爭。我國雖强自忍耐。勉維和平。其如日本之必欲挑戰何。設使日本更借口進逼。國聯旣不能運用盟約第十六條。加以經濟上之裁制。則遠東市塲。完全破壞。當尤非美國所能甘。但又缺乏能阻止日本之實際勢力。此則華府爐邊談話之第四重難關。亦即英美兩國須求一時諒解之一重要因素也。</p>

<p>前認有罪謂環境所迫</p>
<p>路透十三日莫斯科電　今晨十時六英技師控案復審、有驚人發展、被告麥克唐諾以高大而堅决之聲音、發言曰、余確係無罪、旋完全推翻自承有罪之說、並聲明渠從未諭令顧塞符之助手索科洛夫作怠工行爲、檢察官問曰、然則爾何以當時在供詞中、自承有罪乎、答曰、因爲在一種環境下、余以爲承認有罪爲適宜、故余昨日承認有罪、檢察官又問曰、今日爾承認有罪乎、</p>
<p>答曰、否、　我說我確係無罪、我曾給顧塞符等二千五百盧布、因其過時工作也、此欵半爲公司所付、半係我出、檢察官乃以麥氏自寫供詞交麥閱看、供詞中有曾得索科洛夫秘密消息等語、檢察官間曰、爾今日否認之、何以爾當時自寫之、麥答稱、在當時環境之下、以寫此供詞爲較便也云、法庭旁聽者、因今日爲完全工作之日、故人數不若昨日之多、聞麥氏此言、咸爲震動、同時傳聲機倐然損壞、聽審者更不能了解問答之詞、再麥氏供詞中意義有未明處、屢須傳召譯員解釋、昨日麥氏形容憔悴、面有病色、今日則神想不同、雖左足稍跛、然直立庭前、而以鎭靜堅决之語、否認起訴文中及其自寫供詞中之言論、至是停審休息二十分鐘、</p>
<p>續審時檢察官向被告桑頓盤詰、桑頓否認所控各節、檢察官問曰、爾聞飛機引擎聲乎、桑頓答曰、然、飛機引擎確發聲甚響也、檢察官曰、爾何以前作不正確之供詞乎、桑頓答曰、因余神經錯亂也、控案嚴重、使余神經不寗、推事問曰、爾之神經何時恢復、桑頓答曰、四月四日晚余被釋放時、神經始如常、俄員盤詰麥克唐諾與桑頓係用隔離方法、但麥氏聲稱、渠從不知孟克賀斯與克施尼有間諜行爲、桑頓亦稱渠不知麥氏唐諾有破壞或間諜情事、如知之、則渠早將麥氏革除矣云、此時麥克唐諾怱大呼曰、渠知此間諜行爲、今晨供詞頗多矛盾、蓋麥克唐諾繫歡多時、不知全部情形也、</p>
<p>第二次　休息後、麥克唐諾狀態又變、當檢察官詢以承認間諜與否、麥氏低聲承認之、並謂係桑頓起意而公司其他技師亦有關係、又自認渠自己曾發毁壞機器之命令、法庭旋傳桑頓上堂、此次發言盤詰者、係副檢察官羅金斯基、其主旨欲證明桑頓曾由麥處獲得顧塞符所供給之秘密消息、桑頓答曰、余想余從未囑令任何技師覓取秘密消息、余亦不記得曾令顧塞符覓取之、法庭又召麥氏上堂、</p>
<p>麥直認　渠曾得顧塞符之秘密消息、而轉交桑頓、法庭迭傳麥克唐諾與桑頓二人上堂、輪流訊問、麥對於檢察官所問各節、幾完全承認、而桑頓則始終否認、桑頓聲稱、渠從未接到麥氏關於軍事之消息、渠僅獲有與維克公司有關係之情報、渠前在獄中所具之供詞、内有渠與麥氏曾徽集秘密消息一語、但渠現願將﹁秘密﹂一詞删去之云、堂上旋宣讀其供詞、内有全體英技師皆與聞間諜之意、桑頓聲稱、此文雖渠所寫、但渠欲將此節删除、桑頓曰、余寫此文時、余不知所寫者爲何事、實爲完全</p>
<p>無意識　之文字、余在完全不同之環境中、所見所聞使余惶駭、誘余書此、余今願改正之云、檢察官對此兩被告、復訊及金錢事件、桑頓於此、呈出書面證據、證明渠曾私人以低價購買虚布、並借欵與麥氏、及麥氏償還借欵事、檢察官轉向麥氏詢問經手欵項、是否不止此次、麥氏答稱不止此次、檢察官又問麥氏曰、維克公司旣有一人、經付非法活動經費、則公司他人當亦知之、麥氏答稱、然、桑頓被訊及此時、則否認公司諸人與聞間諜事、謂公司諸人僅徽集無害於人之消息耳、檢察官詢以</p>
<p>﹁間諜﹂　之界說、桑頓答曰、間諜者乃以非法行爲謀取官塲秘密之謂也、又曰、余現可確言者、余所簽字之供詞、實不正確、且係在精神壓力下所寫者、檢察官復發冗長問話、問桑頓是否欲施行破壞及怠工行爲、桑頓答曰、余始終從事建設、而從未破壞、桑頓答始終不屈、麥氏則委頓已極幾不能置答、孟克賀斯於被訊時、</p>
<p>堅决否　認有罪、僅知公司爲增進其利益計、曾贈電器進口公司總理杜爾戈夫三千盧布、孟氏又曰、余所簽字承認向杜爾戈夫行賄之文、非余所寫云、顧塞符與其助手索科洛夫供稱、彼等不識孟克賀斯、從未與之有何往來、最後麥克唐諾聲稱、渠在獄中、曾上書政治偵探局及法院、有所請求、但其内容渠現不願在堂上宣佈之云、法庭至此、宣告退堂、觀審某俄人耳語路透訪員曰、君知蘇俄因此案共用去二千五百萬盧布乎、至於案中牽涉之行賄數目、則僅足購幾架打字機耳云、中國</p>

<p>徐家匯天文臺昨日下午四時三十分氣象豫報云、山東四　天曇、有西南至西北風、揚子江流域中段下段天陰、有局部之雨、漸曇、而將轉霽、西北風頗勁峭、馬鞍島以南海濱一帶天陰、有雨霧、北風與東北風更厲、揚子江與九州間有勁峭之旋風、因低壓經過、向東北東進行所致、又昨日下午三時前、二十四小時内、本埠氣温、最高六四·四、最低五一·三、去年同日最高七二·九、最低四七·五、　　怎樣的情形。在三萬三千六百萬農民中。有一萬八千六百萬爲無土地的農民。有一萬五千萬爲有土地的農民。而其中五千萬的富農。竟佔有百分之七十九的農地。這足以證明中國農村階層的分化。而在無土地農民中。又有佃農及傭農之分。同時我們試一查海關進出口貿易統計中我國出口的貨物。十九是農産的原料。道就是說中國農村生産。大部分已成爲商品生産。卽成爲帝國主義的原料生産地。直接間接　受了國際市塲的支配了。然而我們還要注意。中國是受帝國主義經濟侵略的國家。在他們的經濟支配之下。我們城市的資本主義工業雖已開展。但大部尚在他們的掌握中。民族工業。以資本積累的薄弱。不能和帝國主義分庭對抗於是擁有小數貨幣的資本家商人高利貸者便轉向農村的投資。而其中就有重利盤剥的形成。同時。我們還要注意。中國是有封建軍閥制度的存在的。他們以處在優越的地位。爲飽滿他們的私慾。爲取得他們的財源。爲培植他們的勢力。乃用了苛捐雜稅去壓榨着農村。直接受影響是地主和自耕農。地主又去壓榨佃農。自耕農佃農又去剥削傭農。試看中國的農村有這門一個錯綜複雜的情形。是否能如尤先生的理想。以牧師式的傳敎式敎育方法就可以救濟農村。拯救農民。而能造成一個新式的桃花源麽。這點。我希望尤先生不吝賜敎。但我要聲明。我不反對救濟農村。回轉農村。只不報不像這門簡單罷了。</p>

<h3 id="c219">高聲器之動 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— ＶＴ</p>
<p>有好多人抱着一種缺憾，就是收音機發聲欠響亮，不能使用高聲器。（ＬoudＳpeaker俗稱喇叭）要怎樣才能使用高聲器，實在是一般人所想解决的疑問。對于這個問題，常識的答覆一句，要高聲器能夠動作，必須有適當的電力。這譬如一塊大石要掀動牠，也一定要有相當的力量，如果呌一個力量不大的小孩子去搬動很重的石塊那就没有不失敗的。高聲器的動作電力，自然也有一定的條件。</p>
<p>目前使用的高聲器不外二種：一是電磁的，（ＭagneticＳpeaker）。一是電動的（ＤynamicＳpeaker）。電磁式，又分爲喇叭形（Ｈorn）與圓錐形(Ｃone)二種。喇叭形高聲器所需要的電力，大約爲５－５０mw，至電動式的高聲器，則需要２５０－１２５０mw，至電動式的高聲器，則需要２５０－１２５０mw。爲供給這充分的電力，所以在最後一段放大，必須選擇適當的眞空管。同時要得到這必需的電力，又須有適當的低週率放大。</p>
<p>今負荷電力爲７００mw，其負荷電阻爲４０００歐姆。則因爲一般栅極檢波法所能得到的最大而不致失眞的電壓，只能有０·３弗打。所以低週率放大所需要的電壓放大倍數，可以照下述方法求得。</p>
<p>Ｐ＝７００mw</p>
<p>Ｒ=4000</p>
<p>Ｅl=PR=700×4000</p>
<p>=53Ｖ</p>
<p>Ｅl爲負荷的兩端所需電壓。但實騐上當負荷電阻爲眞空管内部耗阻的二倍時，出力最大。所以電阻的總值，即負荷電阻與眞空管内部耗阻之和，即爲Ｒ＋Ｒ－２＝３－２Ｒ因此眞空管屏極線路所需的全電壓。</p>
<p>Ｅ＝５３Ｖ×３－２＝７９Ｖ</p>
<p>但栅極檢波最大入力電壓爲０·３，故所需要的放大率，</p>
<p>Ａ＝７９－０·３＝２６０</p>
<p>這就是說，對于栅極檢波最大出力，要使高聲器完全動作，需要３００左右的放大率。但通常栅極電路的電壓不大，而且爲避免聲音的失眞栅極的輸入力，常應加相當的制限，結果放大率就須在一千以上了。</p>

<p>— 襄</p>
<p>交流電收音機發生困難時，祇需測量他各路的電阻，數值是否準確，便可在極短的時間裏，找出這困難的所在，</p>
<p>這是歐美各國試騐收音機最新的方法，因此可知測量電阻是件很重要的工作。　　普通測量電阻，少不了一只電表，但是電表的價值很貴，許多的無線電同志不易置辦；所以本篇介紹的方法，都是利用玩好無線電者所常備的零件聽筒，電池，電阻和電位器（Ｐotentiometer），先在電位器上分成相等的度數，然後照下面的圖接好，Ｈ是聽筒，Ｐ是電位器，Ｂ是電池，Ｒ是標準電阻，數值是巳知的，Ｘ就是要測量的電阻。線路接好後，在Ｋ處使聽筒線路一合一</p>
<p>斷，這時聽筒内有的嗒一聲，於是轉動電位器的旋柄使Ｋ斷合時，聽筒内寂無所聞；這時Ｏ點至Ａ點的度數就是Ｒr的數值，Ｏ點至Ｄ點的度數是Ｒ２的數值，依照公式，Ｘ便很容易算出了。</p>
<p>例：已知Ｒ是１０００歐姆，聽筒内没有聲音時，Ｒ，是１０，Ｒ２是９０，Ｘ等於９０００歐姆</p>
<p>若要知道這方法的原理，只要翻一翻韋斯登橋的原理，就很明白了。</p>

<h3 id="c222">天綫之種種（續） <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 金雲樵</p>
<p>（二）螺圈式　螺圈式天線，裝置極便，效果亦佳。（如圖五）可用普通天線一根，長約五十公尺，繞成直徑半呎之螺圈，兩端以絶緣子隔之，中貫以繩，如圖中虚綫所示，懸於室内，接引入綫，即可收音，不用時可收下折疊，殊爲便利。</p>
<p>此外屋外用之單根及多根式天綫亦可移作屋内之用。鐵牀架子，有時亦可收音，如以二十公尺長之十八號皮線，沿室之四週綳緊裝置，與牆壁相距一呎，成績頗佳。總之屋内天線，雖裝置上較屋外者爲便捷，但收音機中如無相當之高週率擴大裝置，則無美滿效果。故天線簡單，收音機必須複雜。單管機在與廣播電站極近之處，亦可應用屋内天線。</p>
<p>其他應注意之點</p>
<p>礦石機及單管機之天線，愈高愈佳，但天線愈高，則感受天空靜電愈多，對於小收音機，尚不顯著，如用有强力高週率擴大之收音機，將靜電同時放大，雜聲紛至，反不若用屋内天線之淸朗。又靈敏之收音機，雖免除天地線，亦可收音。但對於外埠電台，往往不能如願。幸母以無謂之便利，致收音機不能儘量發揮其應有之效率。</p>
<p>天線引入線之接頭，其方向以對發電站爲最佳，如在上海收杭州之播音，須接天線之南端，收北平天津，則接北端，故如發現收音機對於某處電台，應能收聽而反失望時，可將引入線換接試之。</p>

<h3 id="c225">更正 <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>前期﹁關於電源﹂第一篇揷圖中Ｃ１Ｃ２誤爲Ｃ１２。Ｃ２係註釋中間之電容器。又第二篇第二圖中濾波部分於繪圖製版時，亦有錯誤，其接線方法可照第一篇揷圖右方改正。</p>
<p>常識</p>
<p>（六）電量</p>
<p>電流與電壓爲正比，與電阻爲反比，已如上述。不過我們還須注意一件事情，就是電量。今若有木桶一隻，能容水一百加倫，而使其每分鐘流出一加侖，則水之流動必可經過一百分鐘，而始流盡。但若水桶所容之水，不及一加侖，那末决不能得到一加侖的水流，其理甚明。所以講到電流，也要先曉得電量。如果電的來源，爲量很少，那末縱使增加電壓，減低電阻，也不能得到强大的電流。我們所謂電流一安培，就是指的每一秒鐘能有一單位的電量通過導體任何部分。這電量單位名爲庫倫（Ｃoloumb）（參看電之單位），就是６２９×１０１８個電子或電荷數。凡在一個鐘頭内繼續不斷的流出一安培電流，則其總電量名爲安培時（ＡmpereＨour），亦即三千六百庫倫。</p>
<p>（七）電力</p>
<p>水自高處流至低處，其力可以利用以做種種工事。（如轉動輪子）而水力的大小，是要看水壓的高低，和水流的大小而定。電流亦然，電流流動時，可利用以點燈，行車，及其他各種工作。這電力也稱電功率，也要看電壓的高低和電流的大小而定。電力單位爲瓦特（Ｗatt）他和電壓電流的關係如下：電力常以Ｐ字代表之。</p>
<p>電力（瓦特）＝電壓（弗打）×電流（安培）即Ｐ＝Ｅ×Ｉ</p>
<p>但因Ｅ＝ＩＲ所以Ｐ＝Ｅ×Ｉ＝Ｉ２Ｒ</p>
<p>眞空管之能力，亦以屏極電壓與屏路電流之乘積表之。例如ＵＸ２０３Ａ，其屏極電壓爲一○○○弗打，屏路電流爲一二五ＭＡ，故其電力爲１０００×０，１２５＝１２５瓦特。但這是我們所輸入（Ｉnput）的電力，到利用以發生振盪電流以後，因爲有許多損失，其輸出（Ｏutprt）的電力，至多只有五十瓦特了。所以２０３Ａ是出力五十瓦特的眞空管。</p>
<p>電臺的電力，亦用瓦特表示。中央播音臺的電力爲七十五基羅（Ｋilowatt）即七莫五千華脫。上海各電臺的電力，大都在五百華脫以下。</p>

<h3 id="c226">說木鐸少年 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>直率痛快的駡人，原是要有特權的人纔能駡的。從前有一種皇恩欽賜的木鐸老人，穿起黄袍，拿着板子，日日在農村或市鎭上閑行，只敎遇見有不孝的鄉黨子弟，他就可以仗了皇帝的勢力，任意打你駡你，或竟拖你上就近的衙門裏去處你以死罪。現在朝代換了，一批新的皇恩欽賜的木鐸少年，却應天運而生，揭筆桿而起，來演起這把戲來了。</p>
<p>木鐸少年，自然要比木鐸老人强得多。老人們穿的那件有皇恩欽賜四字寫着的黄麻外套，少年們當然不屑穿了，說不定他們還會和叛逆子弟一樣地穿上一套摩登的洋服。這麽一來，第一他們就可以避去爲主公做忠實走狗的嫌疑，而裝作光明正大得同武都頭一樣的一條英雄好漢。他們可以在金鑾殿上放屁，可以在衆人頭上撤尿。但鄉黨的叛逆子弟若見了他們而揑一揑鼻，則他們就會忘記了自身的惡臭，而大聲的駡你是鬼鬼祟祟，十足下流，不敢掀開鼻子和他們較量。</p>
<p>他們還能站在第三者的地位，向主公諷示以如何來處置叛逆，說；﹁某某，某某，不是那麽被做了的麽？你爲什麽不步此後塵呢？﹂他們更會借了光明正大的招牌，公然的來通風報信，說：﹁某某就是某某的化名，住在什麽地方﹂。　　記得左傳裏有一段呌作蹇叔哭帥。秦穆公不聽蹇叔之諫而出師，蹇叔因自己的兒子也在一道，所以哭而送之曰：﹁晉人禦師必於殽，殽有二陵焉，其南陵，夏后皇之墓也，其北陵，文王之所辟風雨也，必死是間，吾收爾骨焉﹂。當時講這一段書的塾師對我們說：﹁蹇叔這老頭兒眞厲害，他在哭聲裏，就告訴了他的兒子以地理和戰略了，這文章眞寫得多麽婉曲！﹂我覺得現代的那些木鐸少年們，却都有蹇叔那麽的本領。</p>

<p>杜葛納夫（Ｉ·Ｔurgenev）用來代表十九世紀四十年代的俄羅斯靑年的羅亭先生，在今日中國社會内我們總會碰見不少吧！譬如你在某一個富麗華貴的Ｓalon或是餐室，咖啡店和一切高雅的集會中，一定有這麽一羣善於談吐的富於睿智和熱情的靑年，在那裏毫無拘束的熱烈的誇張的發揮他的議論，他的興奮得十分紅熱的眸子像兩顆小火球般滑溜溜地看人，他的笑嘴時時震動着張開着吐出洪亮的聲音來，博得在府者的同情和贊美，他有時又挺身而起，高舉着拳頭，就像立刻要到前線去衝鋒的戰士，抱着淸敎徒的犧牲精神，勇敢地堅决地去實行自己偉大的理想，並狂熱地鼓動周遭的聽衆，他的豪情英氣是多麽值得人愛敬！他對於社會觀察得很淸楚，他懂得如何的破壞，如何的建設，他富有科學哲學上的智識，而且繪畫，音樂，文學也同樣的愛好，他會告訴你歌德和沙士比亞的作風如何獨特，但丁的神曲是怎樣的美妙，假如他偶然走到鋼琴旁邊，他也會彈出一節悲多芬的名曲來······總之，他是具着多方面的天才的富於熱情的靑年，他的丰度服飾聲音笑貌不知打動了多少少年的心，活潑而嬌麗的姑娘和年輕而多情的少婦，都在熱烈地偷愛着他，時時想親近他，受他的領導，實現那高大深遠的理想······</p>
<p>誰知道，我們這班令人傾倒的靑年，當香色迷醉了的夜半時分，回到自己的房間來，忽然又變爲别一個人了！</p>
<p>他追想着白天所接近過的女郎是如何的可愛；他想怎樣的誘動她，把她拉過來擁抱在自己的懷中，他知道怎樣的去享樂。﹁愛情便是藝術﹂。﹁没有戀愛的生活算不得人生﹂。這一些話，他以後很夠資格的在什麽茶話會，座談會上帶着驥傲的神氣說出了。最後，他計算着怎樣的賺錢，怎樣的請名流喫飯，譬如罷，什麽次長或甚至部長院長之類，並勾帮結派，組織什麽社，談愛談美，發表些不通的肉麻的文字，互相吹捧的去出名，他恨自己的名字不馬上如Ｇoethe　的飛揚世界······把一枝燃短了的雪茄烟投入痰盂内後，他便倒在床上酣睡了，他這時究竟在追求一些什麽美妙的好夢，誰都没有知道，不過，白天他所熱烈發揮過的宏詞高論是早忘得乾乾凈凈了。</p>
<p>說他忘記，也許不對的。你看，第二天他不是仍舊在稠人廣座中，漲紅着臉，嘻開着嘴，狂揮着拳頭，滔滔不斷地激昻慷慨地在信口亂吹嗎？</p>

<p>一個秋天的下午，王二痴立在門产前，忽然動了到上海的念頭，</p>
<p>他站在門前，橡在凝望着什麽，像在痴想着什麽·</p>
<p>天雖然没有下雨，但老是陰沉沉的，西風　　地吹，幾隻寒鴉在喔喔地呌，　　朝南望，王二看到了羅村的全景，看到抱着這村子的一條死水，像躺着的一條死蛇的白肚皮，他又看到了河上的小橋，橋樁已歪了，欄杆也零零落落，還有那村上殘缺的土牆，那都是棄了佃上江南去的人家的茅屋，再遠處，除了幾家地主的靑色瓦屋之外，只是些高高低低的烟囱，默默的朝着天，並没有炊烟·</p>
<p>他很奇怪，這村子並没有遭到無情的大火，也没有遭受慘酷的戰爭，何以會蕭條得這樣的怕人，幾年前的賣零食的叮噹鑼聲也聽不到了，悠揚的誘惑孩子們的錫篇聲也没有了，在今天，他只聽到一種單調的啞聲的寒鴉在秃枝上討厭地啼着，小巷大巷裏，只有秋風挾着灰塵與落葉奔跑，幾條落了毛的狗，瘦骨稜稜地睡在茅屋角落裏，村子裏面的孩子，也是和狗一般的瘦，總之，滿眼都是蕭條的景象·</p>
<p>他站在門前，像在凝望着什麽，又像在痴想着什麽·</p>
<p>朦朧的夜色，巳漸漸追近，空中滿是蝙蝠來往，三十多歲的倔强的王二，一向不了解什麽呌做惆悵，今天不知不覺的在荒凉的心頭，湧出無數的酸涙了·</p>
<p>他想到自己二十多年的佃農生活，一年年，在省儉，忍耐，飢餓，勞苦裏，不能自拔地墮入了貧窮，誰願離開家鄉，無奈家鄉已變成絶食的囚牢；到上海去吧，可是，去過的人又有幾個討得好呢？</p>

<p>（十八）唐才常之黨籍</p>
<p>在述唐才常黨籍之先，吾人須知黄愛龐人佺之黨籍，至今聚訟未决。其實黄龐之從事勞工運動，但知爲勞工服務而已，但知有湖南勞工會而已，别無所謂黨派也。徒以黄龐爲中國勞工解放運動最先犧牲之人，各派爭爲尸祝，而此二人之黨籍乃生問題矣。正如唐才常在晚淸志士中，爲最先舉兵排滿而死者，保皇黨革命派皆欲私爲一黨之光也。章太炎在革命之道德一文中，略謂庚子保皇之役，康有爲以其事屬唐才常，才常素不習外交，有爲之徒龍澤厚爲示道地。其後才常權日盛，凡事不使澤厚知，又日狎妓飲燕不已。澤厚憤發，爭之不可得，乃導文廷式至武昌發其事。才常死，其軍需在上海，共事者竊之以走。是故庚子之變，庚子黨人之不道德致之也。未幾，民報紀元節慶祝大會，有劉某者出而演說，爲唐才常辯誣。略謂才常起事，憑藉會黨，會黨宗旨爲﹁勦滅韃子﹂，即此一語，已足爲唐才常非保皇之證。所以與康梁交通者，或有所爲而爲之。當時革命志士，往往誤認康梁爲同調，非獨唐才常一人爲然。才常旣死，而康梁利用之，以博勤王之名，而爲愚弄黨人之具，其肉不足食，其言亦不屑辨。惟章太炎先生學界之泰斗，革命之先河，其言爲國人所崇信，而亦言此，則唐才常含寃入地矣。其後章太炎作唐才常畫像贊，而頗惜其革命未成。贊云：﹁夢夢之天，蕩蕩之帝，棄我神州，而眷胡裔。黄鶴夜鳴，殲兹明懿。文昌之馘，赤　猶視。（自註，才常死後，梟首文昌門。又云才常目赤色。）視余無恙，書此罔象。﹂蓋此時章先生已視唐才常爲革命同志，不復以保皇黨少之也。</p>

<p>﹁的確，在中國的領土内，帝國主義者及其走狗可以那樣地横行無忌，最少要給他們以一個警告。這就是剛才示威游行的眞義！﹂</p>
<p>他又想到有一次看見一個中國的小商人在日本的小學校面前走過，幾個小倭奴便檢起小石頭來，打向那個小商人的頭上去。日本巡捕看見只是笑着默認這些小倭奴的行動。看那個中國小商人心裏雖然有氣，但不敢發作，只有忍耐着，涎着笑臉走過去，表示一個雅量。他又看見北四川路的日本巡捕比白人巡捕還要趾高氣揚地對中國人作不必要的檢查，對於通行者任意加以侮辱。那末，對於帝國主義者中以警告正是需要有行動的革命羣衆。</p>
<p>想來想去，到後來，海泉不能不自認是一個怯懦的靑年了，絶無當革命者的資格。</p>
<p>﹁但是那些文壇的先進怎樣呢？不是比自己更不成麽？也虧他們自稱爲馬克斯主義者，自稱爲唯物史觀的信徒。﹂</p>
<p>三十四</p>
<p>海泉走向學校去，轉了一個圈子，看見他們並不十分注意今天的示威游行。只是出來時，在校門首，才聽見一個同學在批評說：</p>
<p>﹁×××，老是這樣閙，有什麽結果呢？﹂</p>
<p>海泉聽見後心裏又不輸服起來了。他覺得這位同學簡直是一個冷血動物，對於那樣熱烈地參加革命運動的靑年，不單不表示同情，反轉來講風凉話，眞是豈有此理！</p>
<p>但他反省了一下，覺得自己又患了一個極大的矛盾了。不獨矛盾，似乎是精神上的不健全。他對於唐耀星這班人的態度之專斷，行事之詭秘，常常抱着反感，有時候竟想發作起來，駡他們是欺騙靑年，陷害靑年到牢獄裏去。結果，他斷定他們是無能獲得革命的成功。但是聽見那些中了科舉毒的靑年們在瞎評革命靑年的行動時，他又要憤慨起來，打抱不平，駡他們是落伍。</p>
<p>海泉感着這個極大的矛盾時，精神上眞有說不出來的痛苦。</p>
<p>回到曹世光家裏來時，是薄暮時分了。他踏上了樓梯，聽不見一點聲息，望了望上面，只是滿樓房的灰闇。他走上來，把秋英的房門推開，他看見秋英仍然是和平時一樣歪倒在床上喂乳給小孩子吃。</p>
<p>海泉一看見她，像發見了一個安慰，把今天下午的事變一起忘掉了，頭腦也不會作痛了。他大膽地走近刀的床邊，就在床沿上坐了下來</p>
<p>﹁老曹没有回來麽？﹂</p>
<p>﹁整天的没有回來。﹂</p>
<p>她的精神似乎很焦燥的，表示不耐煩的神氣。</p>
<p>﹁怎麽不開着電燈？﹂</p>
<p>﹁開關壞了。﹂</p>
<p>﹁那末呌二房東修好。﹂</p>
<p>﹁體面！我們樓上的，他管呢！﹂</p>

<p>— 瞻盧</p>
<p>昔人所說的﹁口之於味，有同嗜焉，﹂不過指着飲食二字罷了；自從有了烟草，飲食以外，還得加上一個吸字。</p>
<p>在十七世紀，烟草已由呂宋國傳入閩省，其時，正在明朝崇禎年間；邊塞軍人犯了寒疾，非此不治。但，價值很是昂貴的，相傳一觔烟可換一匹馬，運烟出關的，便可牽馬入關；所以，種烟草的便漸漸興盛起來。崇禎中葉，曾經下令禁種烟草，違者處徒刑；然而，利重法輕，如何可以廓淸烟害呢？後來，加重罪名，犯者處斬；無如嚴禁以後，軍中犯了寒疾，往往不治。没奈何只得弛禁，聽憑民間栽種；到了崇禎末年，三尺童子，都會吸烟，這便是中國盛行吸烟的最初時代。丨丨﹁註一﹂</p>
<p>至於，捲烟盛行中土，不過在三十年前；而外國人吸捲烟，據人傳說，在一八三二年，經埃及國，軍人所發明。其時，有駄着烟草的大隊駱駝經過非洲，被軍人截獲了；一時没有烟斗，想一個極法子，把紙條捲繫以後，銜着抽吸；後來人人效尤，捲烟的勢力，便普徧了全球。</p>
<p>世界名人嗜吸捲烟的，拿破崙，俾十麥，英王愛德華七世，都是捲烟不離於口。中國名人嗜吸烟草的，現在是不可勝舉了；在滿淸康熙年間，蘇州狀元韓　，是酒杯烟筒不離於手的。王漁洋指着烟酒二物，用着論語的句子間　　：﹁必不得已而去，於斯二者何先？﹂韓公沈吟片晌道：﹁去酒﹂。可見他嗜烟勝於嗜酒了。丨丨﹁註二﹂</p>
<p>飯後的唯一工作，便是急於要吸烟，俗稱：﹁飯後一筒烟，賽過活神仙。﹂我在吸捲烟時代，放下飯碗，便要去做活神仙，稍遲片刻，彷彿舌上生毛。自從因病戒除了捲烟，在先，似乎不便；至今已經五年之久，放下飯碗，絶對不會念及吸烟，這呌做：﹁飯後不吸烟，也是活神仙。﹂</p>

<p>— 徐小庭</p>
<p>夜是黑暗的，是沉悶的，是富於麻醉性的一段空間，在這被人們唾棄的空間裏，它組織的細胞，絲毫没有一點活的動力，冷寂的現象，和死去的靈魂一樣，却没有知覺和性靈可言！</p>
<p>繁華的都市，却不是這樣，一般摩登化的靑年男女，他們偏歡喜拾取這唾棄的空間，銷磨他的意志，麻醉他的性靈。</p>
<p>燈紅酒緑的咖啡館，兩性摟抱的跳　廳，以及熱閙的市街，肉的市塲，這些地方，是從夜的冷窖裏，建築起一層熱的和光明的幻境！蒼蠅般的人類，他們支着昏迷的腦袋，却不知不覺，趨腥附羶似的爭逐在那些地方，他們這時委實像飛蛾喜歡在亮的氛圍裏蠢動着一樣。　　都市的夜，是麻醉人們性靈的利器，他暫時的幻境，是不能永遠存在，過了一定時間，仍然是冷寂，黑暗，却没有一點光明可尋的。</p>
<p>中國人慣會度着夜的生活，慣會麻醉自己的性靈，夜，是他們唯一的消遣時間，但是自從九一八與一二八，强暴的日本，到我們國内，放了幾次喚醒砲以後，沉迷在夜的氛圍裏的國人，到了現在，才漸漸的甦醒。</p>
<p>的確，在夜的冷窖上建築的光明，是暫時的，是虚幻的，是褊窄得不能容積許多人的，我們沉湎在它的懷抱裏，是永遠尋不着眞實的光明，我們要救新鮮的富於活動性的朝氣，還要跳過現實的夜的環境，才可以跑到眞實的光明的坦途！</p>

<p>— 夏螢</p>
<p>春在柳絲尖頭跳躍。我的心，也不知給什麽牽動了。我是滿藴着悲哀的心情，跑到西子湖邊。看着别人都那樣高興。去年今日，滬戰正烈，西子湖上也不時有太陽飛機翺翔，可是今年火線隔我們遠了。</p>
<p>湖濱的旅館都告客滿，好容易在朋友的房間裏住下了。門外走廊上﹁司的克﹂着地的聲響，直打進我悲哀的心的深處！</p>
<p>七天的春假，轉眼就過去了。得到什麽呢？看吧！</p>
<p>第一天，白黑格子的圍巾纏上頸邊。</p>
<p>第二天，纎纎的素手拿着司的克。第三天，長旗袍下露出男子西裝褲，第四天，蓬鬆的　髮，粉紅的臉蛋，花的領帶，米色的男子西服。第五天，長的旗袍，外罩短的西服，戴着田間農夫用的闊邊的軟草帽，襟前掛一串佛珠。第六天，自由車在馬路上撞倒小孩子，香汗涔涔。第七天呢，騎馬在湖濱馳騁了。去了，一切都去了。</p>
<p>在春神的懷抱裏沉醉呵！西子湖改變顔色。河山也變色了！</p>

<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>都會中充滿着旅客，所以都會也充滿着旅館（？）</p>
<p>在上海，沿西藏路南京路一帶的大旅館，蜿蜒着似乎比較萬里長城還要壯觀，每當昏夜降臨的時候，總有許多的人們向那長城中進發着。</p>
<p>旅館在名義上似乎是爲旅客而設的，但事實上旅客住旅館的却佔最少數。原因是一部分的旅客鑒於旅館的取費昻貴，寗肯到自己的親友家裏去借宿一宵，而當地一般有閒階級的公子哥兒們，放下自己家裏華麗的屋子不住，却要到旅館去開房間。據說旅館裏不但設備完全，招待週到，而且無拘無束，可以自由活動！（所謂自由活動，當然是包括烟酒嫖賭之類。）</p>
<p>每當禮拜六的夜晚，或者夜節假日，旅館是照例要宣告客滿的。若是有一個新的旅館開市，那光顧者的擁擠，更非筆管所能形容了！</p>

<h3 id="c237">上海夜話 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 張若谷</p>
<p>波蘭作曲家</p>
<p>這一週間，上海來丁兩位音樂家。一位是小歌劇﹁玫瑰茉莉﹂ＲoeeＭarie的作者佛里曼Ｆrjmel；一位是波蘭現代靑年作曲家湯斯孟Ｔansmano</p>
<p>邵洵美詩人邀我到夏令配克，看阿傷心葛蘭娜桃ＡluncionＧranados女士表演西班牙舞的一夜，在休息時間，我看見一個身材不很高，大鼻子，滿臉皺紋的一個老頭兒，穿了雪白的胸衣，和挺直的黑色夜禮服。邵詩人告訴我，那便是佛里曼。他這一次旅行經過上海，是預備搜集一些關於中國民間音樂的資料。</p>
<p>過了不多幾天，邵詩人打電話給我，說他在杏花樓，招待一個波蘭音樂家，要我做陪客。我赴宴的時候，邵詩人很熱心地給我介紹和那個靑年作曲家湯斯孟握手相見，我們隨便說了幾句話。我問起波蘭前任總理兼世界鋼琴名手巴特萊夫斯基的近况，繼知道那一位波蘭前輩老音樂家，自從脫離了政治生涯後，目下正在美洲作音樂演奏的巡禮。</p>
<p>湯斯孟在現代波蘭音樂界，是有了相當的地位，他雖然没有巴特萊夫斯基那樣地給世界的音樂界所注意，他的作品，我還没有聽過，所以不敢妄加批評。</p>
<p>他這一次來上海，頗感到藝術家的寂寞心情，因爲他在日本，頗受彼邦音樂界的歡迎。他在上海勾留數日，意外地受到一種冷淡的待遇，尤其是在上海執樂壇牛耳的工部局管弦隊樂隊指揮梅伯器，對於他毫没有什麽表示，他似乎很有點難堪。</p>
<p>從湯斯孟的談吐中，可以知道他的音樂傾向，有時憧憬着拉韋爾Ｒavel，有時則夢想着斯德拉文斯基Ｓtravinskyo</p>
<p>拉韋爾是現代法國有名的作曲家，他的作風很受他祖國德比西Ｄebussy的印象，有人說他是法國印象派音樂家的後繼人。他的作品，富於純粹音樂的色彩。</p>
<p>斯德拉文斯基，是現代俄國歌劇界的獨步作家，他的作品，完全是革新的，而且富於東方的色彩，常喜歡大膽地　樂曲中用着不調諧的和聲，能得到很好的成功。他有一首名曲，呌﹁伏爾加船夫歌﹂，（卽﹁黨人魂﹂影片中的船夫曲）旋徑幽鬱，有一種凄悲的曲趣。</p>
<p>湯斯孟有一種特殊的音樂直覺，這種直覺和波蘭向來的音樂道統微有不同。波蘭音樂的道統，可以十九世記浪漫派音樂巨匠蕭邦Ｃhopin爲代表。</p>
<p>蕭邦是一位鋼琴的詩人，也可以稱爲鋼琴的靈魂，他的作風，完全是抒情的，充滿着詩的情趣，而且是一位女性的作曲家兼鋼琴名手。湯斯孟的從事作曲，完全取材：國民音樂，並不常常借重民間歌謠，但他會重新發現民間音樂的精髓，他的代表呌做﹁波蘭樂譜。﹂</p>
<p>便在這一夜，邵詩人陪着湯斯孟到福開森路世界學院，參觀大同樂會的古樂奏演。同座者有李石曾，謝壽康，女詩人方瑋德等。在一間可容百人左右的音樂廳中，只有寥寥十數個人，恭聽着中國古代室内樂會。</p>
<p>臺上，先是一首古琴獨奏，高山流水，琴聲幽輕得幾乎聽不出來。接着是琵琶獨奏﹁平沙落雁，﹂最後髣髴是一曲﹁明江夜月﹂，奏完後，我問湯斯孟對於這次樂會的感想。</p>
<p>他說：我第一次聽﹁中國音樂，似乎比lazz還要摩登得多。﹂</p>
<p>等到我告訴他那是中國碩果僅存的古代音樂，他有些吃驚的樣子，同時臉上現出似乎不相信的表情。</p>

<p>按榨菜爲蔬類植物﹁芥藍菜﹂之莖菜所製，味略鹹而鮮潔；因求其久藏；兼以便遠運，多加以辣椒粉拌和，於是味多辣辛；但仍能保持其鮮味，而色澤且因以紅亮可觀。裝置以磁　，口固封，外套篾籃；每　凈重可四五十斤。其種類等次，以（一）産於渝北（巴縣）洛漬菜最上：色光黄亮，塊子大小適中匀齊；質肥而團，味鮮徵辣久藏不變；（二）來自涪陵之涪陵菜次之：塊子大小不匀，間有皮屑；色亦有參差，肉頭較瘦，味辣微鮮；久藏得法，可以不變；（三）鄷都出産之鄷都菜；色鮮亮，肉頭肥；但味較遜，且不耐久藏，通常一二月卽有變化，色澤由黄而萎，味亦帶酸，優點俱失。商人之狡黠者，乃重加辣粉，使其入口極辣，眞味不辨矣。是故榨菜之鑒别，厥爲色澤黄亮，塊子團肥；味須鮮潔，而帶微辣，斯爲上品，數點少一二，卽爲次貨。</p>

<p>— 天方</p>
<p>咱們中國的人口，雖多到不止如﹁過江之　﹂，但人才却老是數得出的這幾位，只要一翻檢民國二十年來的政治史，就可知道上臺下臺，下臺又上臺，看來似乎很熱閙的，原不過是這十八尊羅漢。﹁才難﹂，不其然乎？</p>
<p>爲着才難，於是不免有破格擢舉與降心相從的事。譬如奉送熱河的湯玉麟，誰也知道是一位誤國的名人吧！自從熱河失守，通緝正法的聲浪，喧傳全國，但道路傳聞，或不盡實，於是中央有派員澈查之舉，大槪是﹁查無實據﹂丨也許是﹁抗日無大將﹂，所以﹁逃將作先鋒﹂，通緝之令雖未見取消，軍長倒已實授。</p>
<p>由失地而澈查，由澈查而重任軍長，這原是一個很巧妙的方式。老湯的流年雖然有些不利，官星却也未墜。失﹁主席﹂丨因已無席可主丨而得﹁軍長﹂，未始不足以自慰，較之　擋出國的張少帥，有幸多多矣。</p>
<p>再查呈文中有所謂﹁繼續抗日﹂字樣，可見前此所傳，﹁見敵百餘人而逃﹂，都非事實。民衆阿斗，軍長聖明，冒犯虎威，死罪死罪，但將來修民國史的由此﹁繼續抗日﹂四字，自可推得﹁曾經抗日﹂，丨抗日的不是被稱爲民族英雄的嗎？其名埀百世無疑。至於月給軍費十萬，倒也不貴，丨雖不夠養活一軍士兵，但於八口丨或是十六口三十二口之家，大可長期抵抗了。張少帥似無此厚幸，丨因在於他想到外國去看看外國女人的大腿，再來幾次跳舞。</p>
<p>總之湯玉麟由主席而失地，由失地而通緝，由通緝而重任軍長，是確定的了，也足見政府﹁集中全國人才禦侮﹂的苦心，但所可慮的是湯軍長﹁繼續抗日﹂的策略，是不是﹁繼續﹂過去的成績，在我們這班小民，雖曰﹁阿斗﹂，却也頗關心。</p>

<p>— 丁崇</p>
<p>近日本報載有兩元換算法數則，查其計算方法，非流於迂廻曲折之弊，即有記誦口訣之繁，想大家必認爲不大妥當，在下現在來說明自己所要採用的法子，和諸位討論，如果認爲﹁最簡捷的兩元換算法﹂的話，還請大家用用，以資記賬便利。</p>
<p>按此次我國廢兩改元，係規定永遠銀子○，七一五兩，合銀洋一元，即每兩銀子，值洋一，三九八六元，比一元四角，僅少一釐四毫，以算學言，爲少千分之一，若每兩銀子，以一，四乘之，其積數中减去千分之一，即可得一，三九八六元，照此類推，無論若干兩銀子，用上方法，一乘一减，即便得到所求之數，試舉例證明之。</p>
<p>問有銀三百五十六兩，共合銀洋若干元。</p>
<p>３５６×１·４＝４９８１４４９８·４－０·４９８４·４９７９０１６元</p>
<p>縮寫之算式爲</p>
<p>（３５６×０，４）－（３５６×０·０１４）＝４９８·４－０·４９８４＝４９７９０１６元</p>
<p>由上題證明，此種簡捷方法，換算兩元，不爽絲毫，且其記憶之數字，僅一個﹁一，四﹂，和所減的﹁千分之一﹂而已，又﹁千分之一﹂一數，單須認淸位置，其數目大小，必與所乘之積爲同數字，最易計算。</p>

<p>— 賢</p>
<p>爲了貪看桃花，我加緊了脚步，同伴都離在後面。這是一個不知名的桃林，每年本季，成羣的人都來觀賞，但是像桃花源一樣，每年有不少人莫明其妙的遺落了。我慢步走去，天色已快黑了；我的同伴還没有趕上來，我怕恐迷路，停着脚等候他們。忽然迎面走來一個瘦弱的中年人，他厲聲的問我：﹁幹什麽？﹂我告訴他看桃花走失了同伴。他就改變了笑容說：﹂你也是迷路的，到我家去坐坐。﹂我毫不思索的跟他走，到一處矮小的屋裏。裏面已有許多人，都驚奇的望着我。瘦小的中年人告訴了緣故，一個孩子跳起來說：﹁這人别是探子，像去年一樣的出了大亂子。﹂中年人和悅的說：﹁先生，讓我們搜一搜。﹂我不知是怎樣的一冋事，被他們搜查過後，中年人告訴我：﹁這裏離你們中國很遠了，我們呌老國，有一個小皇帝，他操縱一切，恐怕人民反抗，時常派探子調查。去年也像你先生一樣的來了個迷路的人，後來出了大亂子；所以對先生　重　　　請先生原諒。﹂</p>
<p>我忘了離在後面同伴；更忘了自身不知怎樣歸去；　於小皇帝我發生了好奇心，如今還有這樣的專制國家，就問那中年人你們的政治情形如何？</p>
<p>﹁還不是由小皇帝一意主宰？﹂他說﹁不問内政，外交，小皇帝怎樣說就是怎樣。﹂</p>
<p>﹁人民不會革命嗎？﹂</p>
<p>﹁什麽？﹂</p>
<p>我知道他不明白﹁革命﹂是什麽意　、，就沿用他自己說過的名字﹁人民不會反抗嗎？﹂</p>
<p>﹁他一面採用暗探調查手段，一面在公共塲所設一架跳高機，憑有本領的人去跳；跳過多少就有官做，跳的愈高，官愈大。於是一般游手好閒之徒；練成這一套本領；讀飽了書的憨大，休想比得過。他搜羅了這一班有本領的人服從他，就没有再敢反抗的了。﹂</p>
<p>﹁這也好！﹂我說：﹁遊手好閒之人都做了官，他們穿好的，吃好的，服從小皇帝的，也不致再蹂躪社會了。﹂</p>
<p>﹁先生，你眞是外國人！只知其一，不知其二，知法犯法的比我們小百姓更厲害，他們表面服從小皇帝，騙小皇帝的錢財，於是他們聯絡起來，魚肉小百姓，小皇帝旣信任他們，我們小百姓向誰去訴怨呢？﹂中年人講到這裏，含飽了眼涙，幾乎哭出來。</p>
<p>忽然門外像被人圍住了似的，﹁捉反黨，捉反黨！﹂一片呼聲，從門外送來，中年人嚇得面如土色。</p>
<p>﹁砰！﹂槍聲在空氣中爆發，我睜開眼來，和衣睡在床上，手中的一册小說掉在地上，時表上指着十一句鐘，窗外風雨交作，没有關好的玻璃窗砰后作響。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個年輕的小孩子，從小就度着困苦的生活。自從家父失業以來，家裏的經濟狀况，非常窘迫。我十四歲的時候，就到某輪船西菜間裏去當學徒。這位代理買辦，人很和善，看見吾在那裏，一輩子没有出息的希望，就承他的情，介紹我到本埠××公司裏去當練習生。這公司實在太大了，所以内中分的部份很多；也算我的命該如此，我的那個部裏的部長，太不成話了。他每日到了公司裏，祇知喝酒抽烟，不管公事。我們練習生的工作，就等於做他個人的雜差；買酒啦，買菜啦，忙個不了。有一天他呌我去買酒，半路上天不做美，下起大雨來了，弄得我一身衣服，上上下下，完全濕透，竟找不出一寸乾的地方。那知福無雙至，禍不單行，一進公司的門，就碰着監察大老爺。我馬上就把酒瓶藏過；不料他見我渾身濕透，認爲我在外游玩，大加訓斥。這樣一來時間不免延擱了許久，所以那位部長，還大動其氣，駡不絶口。我受了這口烏氣，眼涙祇有往肚裏嚥罷了。不料公司方面，對於這種吃糧不管事的部長，竟是視若無覩，獨有我們這些小職員的錯處，却眞考核得厲害：到了月終的時候，我竟被開除了！唉！先生，寫到這裏，或竟欲哭無涙矣，請有以敎我。此請撰安　　沈國利謹上</p>
<p>編者按：做奴隸，當然是很苦的，不過做一方面人的奴隸，總還有方法可以自處。最不幸的是做多方面的奴隸；討好了這方，不免得罪了那方，討好了那方，就不免得罪這方。處在這種境地裏，我們就要自己知道自己危險的地位，死中求生，至少要把其中的一個拘束，設法擺脫。即使事不成而反爲所害，也要明瞭這是遲早要遭到的困難，不容悔恨。向使沈君把部長的情形　據實告訴公司當局，或者可以受他們的嘉許。即使不願開罪於人，那末到了被監察查見呵斥的時候，你總該據直各訴了。現在你始終廻護他，他却對於你的停職，怕不會有甚麽同情呢！沈君現在是木已成舟，無法挽就；我們希望你將來再遇到這種境地時，知所自處。同時我們還希望一般當大權的，對於屬員們的考成，必須從大處落墨：即使眞的一個小職員，偶爾游玩一刻，究不致發生大的應饗；要是一個部長，整天價喝酒抽烟，才是非整頓不可呢！</p>

<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>要如換了别人，當然再不願掛這種大權旁落的空名，伍逸却根本不希望奪取什麽權利，因此他反覺得很自在，每天，老是一個人躱在辦公室裏低斟淺酌，喝得大醉而歸，可是當了校長，就有一班人注意了，不久﹁白蘭地校長﹂的雅號便像﹁基督將軍﹂﹁和尚院長﹂一般的在南京給人們呌響了。</p>
<p>（十三）情人的兒子</p>
<p>整箱用銀紙裏着口，用稻草四圍紮縛着的白蘭地酒，打洋什店裏運進來，過不幾天，便一個一個的空着肚子，讓收舊貨的擔着走了。伍逸的傀儡式的領袖生活，就在這樣極單純的環境裏，夢一般的過去了。</p>
<p>也記不淸是經過了幾個年頭，但知伍逸頂上的短髮，已由一小半白，一大半黑，變爲一大半白，一小半黑了。這一年，中國的政治舞臺上，絶不足怪地照例又換了一班名角；可是這一次的換班子，對於伍逸，却起了一些小小的影響。原來他的老東家丨敎育部長丨雖然在過去的幾年裏，已曾很安穏地度過了四五重難關，始終保持着他原有的地位，不料這一次，竟出乎意外的給×院長送了一個﹁着即停職另候任用﹂的指令給人他，於是他就不得不滾蛋，他這一滾蛋，便把伍逸左右的兩位主任老爺也一併帶走了，他們一走，伍逸也忙端整東西，準備走路，因爲他預料新部長一上臺，他這個神主式的大學校長，少不得也要另讓賢能了。那知這新部長偏是當年在××政治學校裏受過他敎訓的令高足，而且還是新做官的嫩臉兒，瞧在師生分上，竟不好意思呌他走，除掉派了他老弟來當事務主任之外，反把敎務上的一半大權，也歸還給了伍逸，這眞使使逸捧着酒杯，一則以喜，一則以懼了。</p>
<p>以前，如果有人問他：﹁貴校裏大槪有多少同學？﹂或是：問他﹁貴校裏有那幾位學生比較活動些？﹂他的答復一定是搖頭：因爲除掉坐在校長室裏喝酒，别的事情，他多不管，其實也是輪不到他管，所以連本校有幾位敎授，幾百同學，他全不知道了丨自從他令高足賞還了他一半的政權之後，他才漸漸摸到了幾分頭緒，同時，還發現他那位長公子丨伍源丨已是本校三年級的高材生了，同時又是學生會中，一個極活動的中堅份子。</p>
<p>伍逸眞是一個命途多乖的可憐人，當他在做傀儡的時候，×大的校務，一切都極順利，也從不曾發生過什麽不幸的事件：待他坐隠金鑾殿，親臨視朝之後，嚴重的問題，便跟着來了，第一件最辣手的，便是學生的愛國運動。</p>

<p>— 華明</p>
<p>好萊塢影界中第一個身負冒險絶技的是包勃洛斯ＢobＲose在無聲片時代他在﹁雪恥之矢﹂ＡvengingＡrrow和﹁山谷妖魔﹂ＨauntedＶally二片中曾一度轟動世界各國，那時候他是個演員，是在環球公司的，自從這二部影片出世之後，包勃在紐約獻技，偶一不愼，幾乎喪命，身上受了重傷，於是杜門養病，息跡於瘋養院者一年多，他休養之後，好萊塢的技藝影片就一蹶不振，雖有幾部拍成，但都是不足道的。</p>
<p>包勒洛斯傷愈以後，雖没有在好萊塢活動，然年紀祇有三十歲左右的壯年時代，雄心未死，豈肯就此丢手，將一身技藝埋没？所以很躍躍欲試雷電華公司正因爲技藝影片之缺乏，物色這一項的人才，一知道包勃的康健已恢復，立刻派人去請，包勃正中心懷，就答應下來。</p>
<p>雷電華淸包勃洛斯來演的第一部技藝影片名字呌做﹁命運的魔鬼﹂ＬuckyＤevils，演員除包勃之外都是美國武術界身負技藝的知名之士，但是演員定後，導演一職再三找不到，普通的導演是不能勝任的，本領好的導演都没有技藝的經騐才學，最後，雷電華方面派包勃自己擔任，包勃也並不推却，欣然從命。　　﹁命運的魔鬼﹂一片没有可怕的化裝，没有科學的器械布置成可怕的形狀，但是從頭至尾没有一段不使人豎起汗毛管來，從飛機上跳出來，從這隻飛機跳到那隻飛機，火車疾馳的時候從火頂上跳出去，在山中極高的削壁上，從上面滾下來，跌到巨大的瀑布中去，在左右歪一分一寸，就碰在尖的山岩上，立刻可以變成肉醬。</p>
<p>﹁命運的魔鬼﹂告成後，雖不知歷多少的險境，所幸全部的演員祇有受傷，並没犧牲了性命的，包勃在工作中間，也受了輕傷，但没有休息過，有二個演員在幾丈高的狂潮中，幾乎沉溺在河中，是全部工作最險的片刻。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c272">再評﹁大丈夫﹂ <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 李瓊</p>
<p>很顯然的，中國電影爲了要適合一般觀衆之進步的需要，﹁火燒﹂﹁大俠﹂之類的國産影片，已經失了它的誘惑性，而素來努力於﹁關東大俠﹂的月明公司，也不能不轉變方向而從事於戀愛把獻了。</p>
<p>固然我們並不否認，有時戀愛的事也能適合電影之需要，進一步的也可以戀愛爲外衣而充實影片的内容。但是﹁大丈夫﹂的製作者，却完全不能理解這重要的各點，祗企圖在多角戀愛的泥坑中翻觔斗。當然，這是不會有新的花樣發現的。</p>
<p>故事本身，就是非常不通的，所以畫面上的進展，完全是牽强附會。雖然有一部份是描寫督軍之兇暴，然而祇是說明他爲了溺愛兒子而帮助兒子搶女人的一些極不重要而又不近情理的事件上，全不能把握更重大的中心而在反軍閥的主題上發揚光大。即就小節上說；如范通之自稱爲兄，﹁計賺﹂文柏，以及化裝逃遁等等，都是附會得十分可笑的。</p>
<p>在演出上，當然不能就一卑劣的故事而演出完美的影片。導演對於鏡頭的運用，太不　得角度的變換。他對於劇中的脚色，没有相當的理解，以致在表演的指揮上，全使劇中人成爲不倫不類。大部份演員，都過於文明戲化，尤其是王東俠更使人難堪。許多過火的表演不免令人肉麻。鄔麗珠肚皮太大，本來應當休息，旣如此，當然活潑不來了。　　外景内景均不見佳。燈光糢糊，字幕太多而幼稚。</p>
<p>整個的說來，不免說他一聲﹁失敗﹂。不過比較﹁關東大俠﹂之類，總算進步了一些。</p>

<p>— 姚寅仲</p>
<p>希望他能在内地各處放映</p>
<p>我們平常看電影，都不外﹁香艶﹂，﹁肉感﹂，﹁浪漫﹂，﹁神秘﹂······一類的片子。這類片子，充其量，都不過是表現女性的酥胸玉腿，和紳士的禮服高帽而已；都不過是表現濃烈的葡萄酒，和銷魂的歌舞而已！這種片子，我們可算已看得夠膩煩了，何如有和這相反的片子來換換口味也好，像過去在滬所映的﹁生路﹂，﹁重逢﹂，和現在正映演着的﹁亞洲風雲﹂等蘇俄的影片，它們正可供給我們這種需求。</p>
<p>眞的，蘇俄的影片，和我們平常所看的絶對兩樣，不但表演的故事兩樣，即表演的技術也是兩樣的。它們不但可以給我們換口味，而且還可以給予我們以新的，偉大的啓示哩！</p>
<p>﹁亞洲風雲﹂，以我國蒙古爲背景，極寫弱小民族備受强大資本帝國主義的侵略欺壓，及弱小民族起來反抗戰勝資本帝國主義。這委實是一部不可多得的有價值的好片子。我希望這片子能夠繼續地在我國境内各處放映着，在這國難嚴重，强敵侵凌，更爲兇惡之際，至少亦可以驚醒一般國人的迷夢，和振起一般國人的精神。</p>
<p>臨了，我還要附帶說一句話，向來外國人都愛把中國人加以極醜惡的描寫，使人飯都嚥不下去的丨如拖大辫，抽大烟及纏小脚等。而這片恰處處相反。於此，我們也可以瞭解世界上誰是吾友，誰是吾讐了。</p>
<p>還有，此片原名及前名國魂均不甚妥我意不若改爲﹁亞洲民族魂﹂來得較切，不知高明的讀者以爲何如？（却酬）</p>
<h3 id="c274">﹁亞洲風雲﹂槪評誰看了不熱血沸騰呢 <a href="#c274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>整個的片子没有甚麽疵議的地方，但對於結尾我們要問：﹁建築在大風上的勝利是否眞眞的勝利﹂？大槪片子到了這個時候已經不得不結束，展開下去旣不可能，說愛國團被白軍擊敗又令人沮喪，所以纔不得已借取風沙的力量吧？　　導演的手段高妙極了丨幾幕决鬥的塲面非常緊張，尤其是兩個人在危崖上厮打而跌落下的一幕，更加有力。幾幕對照的塲面也給與我們强烈的暗示。鐵木耳被槍决的經過，慢慢地做來，但並不鬆懈，一步緊一步的握住觀衆的情緒，使大家不願意看見鐵木耳死去。一個傀儡轉變成一個戰士，很自然地没有唯心的成分在内，經過銀狐的剌激還嫌不夠，在他面前殺死一個蒙古人，這對他的剌激太大了，纔爆發起瘋猛的抗爭。當鐵木耳衝出來，利用顛倒錯綜的字幕與瘋狂的揮舞的混合，煽動起羣衆反抗的熱情。</p>
<p>恐怕人看了而不覺熱血沸騰的很少吧？　　在此中日國交未斷，東北四省讓人，關外義勇軍疊受壓迫傀儡穏坐長春之際，我們的看客，從這張似乎爲我們攝的片子得到些甚麽感想與暗示呢？</p>

<p>新催眠曲</p>
<p>我的小寶貝，寶貝快快睡！晚上睡得早，天亮早起來，寶貝眞可愛，臉兒像玫瑰，我的好心肝！心肝小寶貝！寶貝迷迷眼，心肝快快睡！我的好心肝！心肝小寶貝！</p>

<p>（二）滴令！滴令！搖搖銅鈴，小寶寶騎馬到遼寗，回來帶隻飛艇，坐着飛艇殺敵兵。</p>
<p>（三）堂陀！堂陀！打打小鑼，小寶寶騎馬到熱河，回來帶隻駱駝，駱駝背上唱戰戨。</p>
<p>（四）噓利！嘘利！吹吹竹笛，小寶寶騎馬到江西，回來帶面國旗，爹娘一見笑嘻嘻，</p>
<p>蝶和蜂</p>
<p>（一）蝴蝶兒，飛飛飛，飛到東，飛到西，飛入花中便著迷！花做枕頭葉做被，多麽快活，多麽適意。呵！冬天到了，葉落花飛，蝴蝶兒失了憑依，忍着凍，耐着飢，好不慘悽？</p>
<p>（二）蜜蜂兒，嗡嗡嗡！飛到西，飛到東，苦苦辛辛做着工，有時備着無時用，營巢釀蜜，忙着勞動。呵！冬天到了，風冷霜濃，蜜蜂兒安住巢中，糧食足，暖烘烘，快樂無窮！</p>

<p>天一消息：天一影片公司的新片﹁生機﹂最近在邵醉翁的監製之下，各部的工作異常緊張，前天拍工廠門口一幕用臨時女演員四十名，某介紹所對於天一的需要，頓感困難，因爲上海的臨時女演員，差不多都習尚時髦，短衣工人模樣的女演員，實在不易多得。其後天一又拍工廠内景，需要那種女演員六十名，這一來又累了介紹所四處奔走着去找了，從早到晚找尋的結果，統共尋了四十八名，最後就實行了拉夫凑數，纔把難關打破，但是這班短衣工人在廠工作的一幕，的確很偉大而逼眞。</p>
<p>曁南消息；曁南公司的﹁爲國爭光﹂，自從去年冬天開拍至今已工作四閱月，可是經濟時遇不濟，所以不能一氣拍完，前天他們在龍華拍攝義勇軍出發的外景，據說是最末的一幕。全劇亦於昨日攝畢，諒放映日必不遠矣。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Fierce Battle at Luan Yang for Two Days and Nights: Our Troops Drive the Enemy to the East of the City <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Stalemate in the Area of Motianling and Liucunzhai</p>
<p>Enemy Planes and Heavy Artillery Fiercely Bomb Various Locations</p>
<p>No Changes on the Xifengkou Front Line</p>
<p>(Beiping) A fierce battle raged in Luanyang City all day yesterday, with the city changing hands several times. Our troops fought desperately in hand-to-hand combat, suffering casualties amounting to three battalions. It is reported that several of our regimental commanders and battalion and company commanders died for the country. The enemy was able to break into our Luanyang City defenses this time because a certain unit of our troops from Dalingkou was transferred a few days ago to reinforce Lengkou, leaving the area thinly defended. The enemy suddenly attacked with an elite infantry force of over two thousand men in a suicide squad formation, taking advantage of the weakness to capture our key passes in succession. Our troops on the Xifengkou front were also affected. Fortunately, our officers and soldiers fought valiantly, finally driving the enemy to the east of Luanyang City. As of last night, the enemy and us are still stalemated in the area of Motianling and Liucunzhai. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zunhua reports that the enemy on the Xifengkou front is still attacking our positions in the area of Mengziling, Laoposhan, and Haierling, bombarding them with heavy artillery all day long. Our troops are still firmly defending the original positions outside Xifengkou. The fighting was very fierce last night. At dawn today, the enemy was repelled by our forces. Last night, over two thousand enemy troops fiercely attacked our Luanyang City, with both sides contesting the city more than seven times. Our troops suffered casualties of □□ hundreds, while the enemy suffered even heavier casualties. The fierceness of the battle was comparable to that at Luo Wen Yu and others. This morning at 5:00 AM, the enemy retreated to Laoheishan, and our troops are currently in pursuit. If Luanyang is lost, Xifengkou will be difficult to defend. We have urgently dispatched reinforcements from the rear to annihilate the enemy forces on this route. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Xifengkou area, after the enemy invaded from Dongjiakou, they used heavy artillery fire to cover large groups of infantry, launching a fierce attack on our Motianling, Xiaying, and Liujiazhai area starting yesterday morning. The fighting was extremely fierce. By evening, our troops had suffered over 800 casualties, while the enemy suffered twice as many. At the same time, several enemy aircraft repeatedly bombed, destroying over a hundred civilian houses in Zunhua. Last night, in the quiet of the night in Ping City, intermittent artillery fire could be heard in the northeast, indicating the intensity of the fighting along the Great Wall line. Over seventy enemy aircraft bombed our various passes along the Great Wall, including Lulong, Funing, and Qian'an, dropping over a thousand bombs. Qian'an City and Luanyang City were among the worst hit, with fires breaking out in several places. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The total number of enemy troops who invaded from Dongjiakou and Lengkou is approximately over three thousand. They assembled in the area of Shangxiaying and Xiaxiaying and launched a general offensive on our Luanyang City Liujiazhai defense line on the morning of the 13th. The Japanese army used aircraft and heavy artillery to provide cover, bombing our trenches outside the city. The artillery fire only stopped last night on the 13th. In total, the Japanese army fired over a thousand shells. Their infantry took advantage of the artillery fire to advance. In the battle of Liujiazhai, our side suffered over 700 casualties, while the enemy suffered twice as many. The enemy’s attacking force this time is the elite of the newly deployed 8th Division under Suzuki, equipped with over thirty heavy artillery pieces. Today, there is no change on the Xifengkou front. The wounded officers and soldiers of our troops at Liujiazhai and Motianling on the 13th have all been transported to field hospitals, and many of them sustained injuries from artillery shells. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Enemy Troops Destroy Our Defensive Works <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding Xifengkou, the enemy and our troops fought fiercely all day from the morning of the 13th, with the positions changing hands several times. Our troops suffered over 500 casualties, and the enemy suffered even heavier casualties due to uphill attacks. The fighting slowed down slightly at night. Starting at 7:00 AM on the morning of the 14th, the enemy resumed concentrated heavy artillery fire. At the same time, eight aircraft bombed our positions, causing significant damage to the constructed defensive works. Currently, our troops are repairing the defensive works while desperately resisting. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Enemy Suicide Squads Also Use Broadswords <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since the enemy started adding reinforcements to Mengziling and Dalingkou outside Xifengkou starting on the 12th, the total number is approximately five to six thousand. The enemy troops attacking Luanyang City and Xifengkou this time are all enemy suicide squads, wearing steel helmets, steel wire neck protectors, and steel wire vests. Our broadsword squads were once at a disadvantage, so they changed their tactics, targeting the enemy's hands and legs. The enemy suicide squads also carried large broadswords, similar to our country's horse-chopping swords, but longer than our broadswords by more than a foot. However, the enemy's use was clumsy, and they were still no match for our broadsword squads. (14th Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Enemy Harasses Our Right Flank Positions <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy attacking our positions in the Haierling and Luanyang City area on the morning of the 12th fought a bloody battle all day, only slowing down slightly at night. On the morning of the 13th, the enemy continued to bombard our positions with artillery and aircraft, almost completely destroying our positions. It only stopped at dusk. On the 13th, our officers and soldiers suffered casualties of eighty or ninety. Over five hundred enemy cavalry infiltrated from Dongjiakou, harassing the vicinity of our right flank Litai Zishan position. They have been repelled. (14th Dispatch)</p>

Our troops pursued and recovered Majiagou, Shangwangzhuang, Xiawangzhuang, and other places. We captured over twenty light machine guns, over a hundred rifles, and several horses, killing forty or fifty enemies. Our side also suffered twenty or thirty casualties. They are currently still in pursuit. Approximately over thirty enemy aircraft continued to reconnoiter and bomb our army positions in the air this morning, causing no major damage.

<h3 id="e14">Public Trial of the Chen Duxiu Case <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>Chen Peng Straightforwardly Admits to Being a Trotskyist Communist</p>
<p>Does Not Admit to Committing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At 9:43 AM on the 14th, the Jiangsu High Court publicly tried the Chen Peng case in the Jiangning District Court. Security was tight, and the audience was crowded. The presiding judge was Hu Shanxuan, with judges Lin Zhemin and Zhang Bingci, clerk Shen Yuren, prosecutor Zhu Xie, and defense attorneys Zhang Shizhao, Wu Zhiping, Peng Wangye, Jiang Haoshi, and Liu Zuwang. Those summoned were Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Pu Yifan, Wang Wu (i.e., Song Fengchun), Wang Ziping, He Afang, Wang Zhaoqun, Guo Jinghao (i.e., Peng Daozhi), Liang Youguang, and Wang Jiantang, totaling ten people. Chen and Peng were calm and self-assured, looking around naturally, and sometimes even cracking jokes that made the audience burst into laughter. After the court opened, the prosecutor first presented the public indictment, recounting the circumstances of the arrest, concluding that Chen and the other ten people had formed an organization or gathering with the aim of endangering the Republic of China, thereby violating Article 6 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Crimes Endangering the Republic of China. Furthermore, Chen and Peng used words to propagate treason, while Wang Ziping and He Afang assisted in the propagation of treason, and there was also a strong suspicion of violating Clause 3 of Article 2 of the same law. The communist books and documents seized were all items used for the crime and in preparation for the crime and should be confiscated together according to Article 10 and Clauses 1 and 2 of Article 6 of the Criminal Law of the same law. He filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 253, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law. The presiding judge then summoned the ten defendants to question them about their names, ages, places of origin, addresses, occupations, etc. Then, they were questioned individually. According to Chen's statement, after being elected as the secretary of the Chinese Communist Party in 1927, he was expelled due to disagreement. "I am a Trotskyist. I am unwilling to say more about the situation within the party. The Spark and School Life publications were both edited by me and have no connection with the Third International. Our faction has very few people and little power. More workers participate. The funding is self-raised. Peng and I are both standing committee members. There are a total of three standing committee members and two alternate members, named Pu Yifang and Luo Yao. I don't know Pu Yifan. Song Fengen is only a party member and not an alternate member of the Standing Committee. Given the current situation in China, it is not yet possible to organize a Red Army. A revolutionary party must seize power and of course wants an insurrection and capitalists must of course be overthrown. We have nothing to do with the red bandits in various provinces such as Hunan, Hubei and Jiangxi, because the time for insurrection has not yet arrived. I admit that I oppose the Kuomintang, but I do not admit that I endanger the Republic of China." Peng stated that he was expelled from the Communist Party at the same time as Chen and served as a standing committee member of the Trotskyist faction at the same time. The rest of his statement was roughly the same as Chen's. Then, Pu Yifan was summoned. He did not admit to being a communist, and he did not know what the standing committee was. At the time of his arrest, he was the editor of the China Merchants Bureau Monthly. Manager Li Weipu wanted to bail me out, but he was not successful due to another case. Colleagues were afraid of being implicated and dared not speak. The boxes found in my residence were deposited by a friend, etc. Then, Wang Wu (i.e., Song Fengchun) was summoned. According to his statement, he had participated in the Trotskyist faction, but after being arrested, he was released on bail due to illness and had no activities. He had only been out of prison for ten days before being arrested again. "I am not a standing committee member. I don't want to be mixed up. Please don't call a deer a horse." It was already 1:30 PM and the court adjourned. The trial will continue at 9:00 AM on the 15th. (14th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since Chen Duxiu was arrested and brought to Nanjing last winter, the Prosecutor's Office of the Supreme Court investigated the results and filed a public prosecution for the crime of endangering the Republic of China. It is now scheduled for a public trial on the 14th. The Jiangsu High Court has specially dispatched Hu Shanxuan, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court, to preside over the trial together with judges Zhang Yuci and clerks.

According to Liu, China's diplomatic policy towards Japan has consistently adhered to a consistent principle since our country accepted the League of Nations' report. The so-called direct negotiations are all a Japanese propaganda tactic to deceive the League of Nations, abandon its responsibility to handle the Sino-Japanese issue, alienate our domestic feelings, and relax the spirit of resistance against Japan. However, these despicable methods have been understood by the world and will not be confused by them. When I met with the ambassadors of various countries in Beiping, they all expressed their sympathy for us. (14th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e21">Washington Fireside Chat and Far East Letter <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>The British Prime Minister will cross the Atlantic Ocean to be a guest in the White House, where he will discuss how to restore the world economy and indirectly seek understanding between the UK and the US. The former French Prime Minister will also go to the US at the same time. The three giants will chat about world problems at the White House fireplace, hoping to get a more concrete answer to solve the current difficulties before the opening of the World Economic Conference. In addition to the UK and France, nine other countries, including Germany, Italy, China, Japan, and Canada, have been invited to attend. More than 40 countries have not been invited. However, this meeting is likely to be a conversational format rather than a formal round table meeting, and the main protagonists will be the five countries of the UK, the US, France, Italy, and Germany. The UK, the US, and France are especially the main leaders. We do not need to speculate too much about the outcome of the meeting beforehand. However, according to the general situation, it is not difficult to figure out its underlying meaning.</p>
<p>Eleven countries have already been invited, and almost all the world's major countries are listed. However, the Soviet Union, which has not yet restored normal diplomatic relations with the United States, is missing. There are also no small countries below Poland in Europe. In addition to the increasingly profound opposition between capitalist and socialist countries, there will also be huge rifts between large and small countries and between different ethnic groups. In the future, the European political situation may become more and more entangled, and the international crisis will be even more irreparable. This is the first major difficulty of the Washington fireside chat.</p>
<p>The UK and the US have long been in opposition, or at least can be said to be unharmonious. As far as the Far East market is concerned, half of the UK's exports to China are cotton and wool textiles, but they mostly belong to high-end products. Therefore, although China's textile industry is gradually developing, there is currently little conflict with British goods. (It will be different again in the next stage.) Others are metal products and mechanized chemical industries, which are the biggest competitors of the United States of America. It is not easy to achieve harmony. This is the second major difficulty of the fireside chat.</p>
<p>Financial capital is the only center that dominates the world in modern times. The United States occupies the current world financial throne. Even if it is shaken by the financial panic, its natural endowments are very strong and its strength is still strong. The war debt alone is enough to overwhelm the UK. The United States is in a dominant position in North and South America. Even in the Far East, American labor will gradually expand. It is certainly far inferior to the British Empire at present, but how can we not worry about the future? This is the third major difficulty of the fireside chat.</p>
<p>What is even more serious is that it seems to be only a local problem on the surface, and what is being fought for is the rise and fall of the nation. It seems to have little direct and obvious relationship with the world economy. However, it is actually very important. At the same time, the aggressor believes that their military actions are to seek world security and plan for peace in East Asia. To put it more clearly, it is to defend against the Soviet Union. The UK has tacitly approved this action, and France has also expressed relative understanding, both believing that Japan may be a loyal subject of capitalism. However, Japan itself is only using this as a mask. Its only purpose is to provoke foreign wars and use military industry to stimulate the exhaustion of its domestic industry. It believes that occupying Heilongjiang and expanding the business scope of the South Manchuria Railway is enough to alleviate its economic panic and break its so-called national crisis. But the fact is far from true. The economic panic is becoming more and more profound. Japanese imperialism is exerting its brute force, annexing Heilongjiang, and invading Jinzhou to the west, believing that once the three northeastern provinces are obtained, there will be a reliable source of everything from minerals to agricultural products in the future. Japan's economic crisis can be eliminated from then on. How can it be known that not only can it not be effective, but it also makes Japan's crisis even greater? Therefore, it takes the pretext of national border security to attack Jehol. Now that Jehol has fallen into the hands of the Japanese, it seems that the declaration of not invading south of the Great Wall can be realized, at least in the short term. However, Jehol's success still does not help Japan's panic, but increases Japan's militaristic fever. Therefore, troops are stationed in Linxi to spy on Dolun, and attacks on Lengkou are disrupting eastern Luan. I fear that the urgency of the crisis is not limited to this.</p>
<p>The fire that is sweeping the Far East has spread to four provinces. Although the nations want to maintain calmness and deny the war, and our country is trying hard to endure and maintain peace, what can be done about Japan's determination to challenge us? If Japan further encroaches with an excuse, and the League of Nations cannot use Article 16 of the Covenant to impose economic sanctions, then the Far East market will be completely destroyed, which the United States will not be able to tolerate. However, it lacks the actual power to stop Japan. This is the fourth major difficulty of the Washington fireside chat, and it is also an important factor for the UK and the US to seek temporary understanding.</p>

<p>(Harbin) The dispute between Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo" over the railway has now entered a new stage. Soviet Russia is willing to return freight cars but not locomotives. Today, the puppet State Department issued a note to the Russian Consul General here, demanding that all locomotives of the Chinese Eastern Railway detained by Russia be returned immediately and unconditionally. According to general opinion, if Soviet Russia incites strikes or hesitates on the return of vehicles, then "Manchukuo" will seize the Chinese Eastern Railway. At the same time, it is heard that Moscow has agreed to withdraw the Soviet Russian customs personnel in Manzhouli and Suifenhe into Russian territory. (13th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Arbitration Treaty Shelved Due to The Hague Tribunal Issue</p>
<p>Japanese News Agency Claims that the Netherlands Recognizes Japan's Special Nature in the Far East</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to the announcement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs today regarding the Japanese-Dutch arbitration treaty negotiations, Japan may withdraw from the Permanent International Court of Justice in The Hague. The reason why the Japanese-Dutch negotiations cannot be completed at present is because the Netherlands wants to stipulate in the treaty that all disputes should be submitted to the World Court, while Japan does not want to have this binding clause, because Japan may withdraw from the League of Nations court. According to a spokesperson for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Japanese-Dutch arbitration treaty seems to be a model for Japan to negotiate similar treaties with the world's major powers, because Japan has withdrawn from the League of Nations and hopes to make up for its isolation by this means. Leaders of the Japanese labor community are also now advocating that Japan should withdraw from the International Labor Bureau in Geneva, because the Bureau is also an organ of the League of Nations. (Tokyo) The Japanese Minister to the Netherlands, Hiroshi Saito, and the Dutch Foreign Minister, Brookland, have made rapid progress in the recently held negotiation on the Japanese-Dutch arbitration treaty. According to Minister Saito's report to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 13th, the Dutch government has recognized the Japanese claim, which is the most difficult point in this negotiation, that Japan should recognize special nature of Japan in major issues in the area north of the Pacific equator and in the Far East. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately decided to submit the original draft of the treaty to the cabinet today and request approval. According to Minister Saito's report, the Dutch Foreign Minister is scheduled to resign on the 20th of this month, so this treaty must be concluded before the 18th. However, due to various preparations and procedures, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs intends to formally sign the treaty after the new Dutch Foreign Minister takes office. The conclusion of this treaty is a concrete result of Japan's implementation of individual and independent diplomacy with various countries based on its new diplomatic policy after withdrawing from the League of Nations, which has attracted attention from all sides.

<p>Japanese Circles Hope for Diplomatic Negotiations to Remedy the Situation</p>
<p>Cotton Textile Industry Association Considers Adaptation Measures</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The British Ambassador to Japan, Sir Lindley, acting on instructions from his home government, met with Japanese Foreign Minister Uchida this morning to inform the Japanese government six months in advance of Britain's decision to abrogate the 1904 India-Japan Commercial Treaty. Asahi Shimbun reports that at a time when the World Economic Conference is about to convene with the aim of dismantling trade barriers and strengthening international economic relations, the Indian government has abrogated a 30-year commercial treaty, which is a major link in the economic and friendly relations between the two countries. This is truly unfortunate. The future relationship between the two countries has become pessimistic due to the drastic measures taken by the Indian government, which is deeply regrettable. However, it is hoped that diplomatic negotiations in the next six months will find the best way to overcome this difficulty. Abe, the president of the Japan Cotton Spinners' Association, told reporters that India's abrogation of the treaty would have adverse economic and political effects on Indo-Japanese relations. He believes that the Indian government's decision was instigated by the Lancashire cotton industry, which is suffering greatly from Japanese competition. The Japan Cotton Textile Industry Association will carefully consider ways to adapt to the new situation. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the issue of the abrogation of the Japan-India Commercial Treaty, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry consulted yesterday afternoon between Minister of Commerce Nakajima and Director of the Trade Bureau Terao. As a result, it was decided to invite general export traders to a joint government-private sector countermeasure conference within the next few days. At the same time, a prompt investigation will be conducted into the state of dumping of export products overseas. (Dentsu, 14th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the British government's sudden notification of the cancellation of the Japan-India Commercial Treaty, the Japan-India Association convened an emergency meeting at 11:00 AM on the 14th to discuss the aftermath. It was decided that although the unilateral cancellation of the treaty was not illegal, such a thing was not expected in terms of international goodwill. Therefore, they will cooperate with related countries to consider countermeasures and petition the government to propose this issue at the Washington Economic Conference to attract the attention of countries around the world. At the same time, they will demand reflection from the British and Indian authorities. (Nichi-Ren, 14th)</p>
<p>Osaka The abrogation of the Japan-India Commercial Agreement has caused a major shock to Indian merchants in Japan. In particular, cotton importers believe that Japan may impose retaliatory tariffs. If so, Indian cotton merchants, both domestic and foreign, will suffer a fatal blow. As the abrogation of the treaty is a sacrifice for the sake of British economic policy, Indian merchants in Osaka, Kobe, and other places gathered at the Kobe Indian Merchants' Trading Association to discuss countermeasures. As a result, Indian people in general feel that it is necessary to incite anti-British sentiment. They will soon send an encouraging telegram to their home country. (Dentsu, 14th)</p>

Some say that the Sino-Japanese dispute is now over and that Japan should be allowed to swallow what it has taken. In this way, Japan may be slightly more peaceful elsewhere in the world. Those who hold this view are making a big mistake. This is not about seizing territory, but about insulting the entire League of Nations. British Prime Minister MacDonald spoke only about the trip to the U.S., denying that there was an agreement on the war debt issue, and said that if most of the obstacles to international trade are not removed, the World Economic Conference will have little hope of success. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department has received a formal response from the French government, expressing its acceptance of the American invitation to participate in the Washington talks. Former French Prime Minister Herriot has also agreed to serve as a representative. The U.S. government is extremely pleased. Herriot is scheduled to depart from Le Havre, France, on the 17th of this month and, after arriving here, will stay at the White House with British Prime Minister MacDonald for two days to formally hold talks between the United Kingdom, France and the United States. The public attaches great importance to these talks. German representative, the new ambassador Dr. Luther, is scheduled to arrive in the U.S. on Friday aboard the Bremen. In addition, China, Italy, and Chile have also accepted the American invitation. Chinese Minister to the U.S. Shih Chao-chi said that the Chinese representatives have not yet been appointed. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's representative is Finance Minister Jung. Those who have not been invited to participate in the talks, Colombia, Czechoslovakia, Romania, have agreed to participate in the talks through their respective envoys to the U.S.. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Former Prime Minister Herriot went to the Presidential Palace at 5:00 PM today to confer with President Lebrun on his mission to the U.S., which lasted more than forty minutes. Herriot declined to issue a statement when he left the Presidential Palace. Herriot also met with the French Ambassador to Germany, Poncet, today for some time. (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) French Ambassador to the U.S. de Laboulaye met with representatives of the American press this afternoon. When asked about the war debt payment that was due on December 15th of last year, the Ambassador stated that in order to change the public opinion of the French people and parliament, a new fact must occur. As for what the new fact is, it is not appropriate for him to explain. He also stated that the war debt issue is only a part of the entire economic and political issue, including commercial issues. It can be seen that the French attitude is in line with the plans repeatedly announced by the U.S. Secretary of State, especially regarding tariffs. France is completely in agreement with the U.S. and supports mutual concessions to form a compromise. As for the naval issue between France and Italy, Ambassador de Laboulaye stated that since Mussolini's Four-Power Pact, there are other issues more important than the naval issue. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Standing Committee of the Economic League held a meeting at the Marunouchi Industrial Club at 4:00 PM yesterday to discuss dispatching representatives to the Economic Conference. The person selected is League President Gō Seinosuke. However, the selection of this economic representative may change depending on the qualifications given by the government. Also, the Economic League will not dispatch representatives to preparatory meetings as there are no problems. Representatives will only be dispatched to the main conference. (Dentsu, 14th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently consulting with the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, and the private sector on the direction of Japanese representatives to the Washington Economic Conference. It is also liaising with the military to study political issues. It is reported that Japan's attitude and direction are generally as follows: (1) The Japanese government believes that there is absolutely no need to discuss the Manchurian issue at this conference. (2) Because Japan is adjacent to China and Russia, when discussing disarmament issues, it will strive to make all countries understand that Japan is actually responsible for maintaining peace in the Far East. (3) Regarding the most important tariff barrier issue in economic issues, Japan cannot discuss this issue on the same basis as other countries due to special circumstances. (4) As for other economic issues such as controlling currency and the movement of capital outflow, Japan will cooperate with all countries. (Nichi-Ren, 14th)</p>

<p>Warsaw The Polish government recently received an invitation from the U.S. to send its ambassador to the U.S. to participate in the Washington talks to exchange views on economic and disarmament issues.

There is a relationship of solidarity among these countries, and the world should also pay attention to it. The Polish government has been in contact with the countries of the Central and Eastern European agricultural group to ensure that their actions are closely coordinated. (Havas, 14th)</p>

<h3 id="e31">U.S. Recognition of Soviet Russia Delayed <a href="#e31" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c31" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">31</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Officials here are paying close attention to the case of British technicians accused in Moscow. The reason is that the Democratic government's platform originally advocated recognizing Soviet Russia. Up to now, Washington has been unable to take this into account due to various important international issues. In addition, if the United Kingdom and Russia break off diplomatic relations due to the case of the accused British technicians, the relationship between the U.K. and the U.S. will also be affected if the U.S. recognizes Soviet Russia at this time. It seems that the U.S. will not recognize Soviet Russia until after the opening of the World Economic Conference. However, if Soviet Russia does not participate in the Washington talks regarding the limitation of millet production, it may be difficult to reach a compromise. Fortunately, other wheat-producing countries may be able to explain on its behalf. For example, France previously acted as an intermediary between the U.S. and Russia when discussing the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and can also communicate opinions this time. (Havas, 14th)</p>

According to him, only the National Government and the other four Yuans have the right to propose laws. As for the Central Political Council's referral for discussion, the original outline did not have this provision, so it is necessary to add that the Central Political Council has the right to refer cases for discussion, and that the proposals of the departments and commissions under the various Yuans should be submitted to the various Yuans for transfer to this Yuan for unified effect. He also said that because the Central Political Council's referral cases, in addition to the principles, often refer all the clauses to this Yuan, resulting in a loss for what to do. Because the principles determined by the Central Political Council cannot be changed, it is hoped that the Central Political Council will only stipulate its general outline and then this Yuan will carefully formulate laws, and invite relevant agencies to send personnel to attend and explain during each review to achieve practical results.

<p>Roosevelt Further Requests Congress to Issue the Same Public Bonds to Rescue Small Families</p>
<p>Inflationary Currency Faction Takes the Opportunity to Propose Silver and Other Bills to Force Congressional Adoption</p>
<p>(National, Washington, 13th) U.S. President Roosevelt's rural relief bill passed the House of Representatives today by a vote of 387 to 12. The bill stipulates the issuance of 2 billion Gold Yuan in public bonds to provide long-term, low-interest loans to farmers whose mortgages have matured, accepting their transferred collateral. When the bill was presented for discussion in the House today, the inflationary currency faction took the opportunity to propose a silver plan as an amendment, advocating the inflation of 8 billion Gold Yuan, part of which would be used to purchase silver. Subsequently, Speaker Rayburn intervened, ruling that the amendment was not in order, and the President's original bill was put to a vote and passed.</p>
<p>Today, the U.S. President also sent a special message to Congress, proposing the issuance of the same public bonds to rescue small family homeowners whose mortgages have matured, providing them with long-term, low-interest loans and accepting their transferred collateral. He also intends to legislate to allow homeowners to temporarily suspend payment of principal and interest under appropriate circumstances.</p>
<p>It appears that the inflationary currency faction in Congress is attempting to take advantage of the review of various important bills to propose silver or other inflationary plans to force congressional adoption. Today, a resolution was also submitted to the Senate Banking and Currency Committee, requesting a swift review of various inflationary currency proposals.</p>

<p>(Reuters, London, 12th) Labour Party members of the House of Commons today raised a motion to impeach the government over the unemployment issue. Secretary of Commerce Runciman defended, saying that commercial treaty negotiations are currently underway, which should bring immediate and practical benefits to some of the British industries currently experiencing the most difficulty. He hoped that the satisfactory results of the Argentine negotiations could be announced soon, and that the commercial treaties established with Norway and Denmark could also expand trade. Negotiations between Britain and Sweden are currently making good progress, and a commercial treaty with Germany has also been established. As a result, the amount of British coal exported to Germany will be more than doubled. Minister of Health Young announced changes to the government's unemployment relief policy, saying that the government would propose a bill to assist all able-bodied unemployed people, including those who should not receive unemployment benefits, with the government bearing the administrative and financial responsibility. This move would alleviate the burden of poverty relief on local governments. The impeachment motion was subsequently defeated by a vote of 384 to 46.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Another Stunning Development in the Moscow Trial <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>MacDonald Reverses His Testimony and Pleads Not Guilty</p>
<p>Claims Previous Guilty Plea Was Due to Compelling Circumstances</p>
<p>(Reuters, Moscow, 13th) At the resumption of the trial of the six British engineers this morning at ten o'clock, there was a stunning development. The defendant MacDonald, in a loud and determined voice, stated, "I am indeed innocent," completely reversing his previous confession of guilt. He also declared that he had never instructed Gussev's assistant, Sokolov, to engage in sabotage. The prosecutor asked, "Then why did you confess guilt in your previous statements?" He replied, "Because under certain circumstances, I believed it was expedient to admit guilt, so I confessed guilt yesterday." The prosecutor asked again, "Do you admit guilt today?"</p>
<p>He replied, "No. I say I am indeed innocent. I gave Gussev and others 2,500 rubles for their overtime work. Half of this money was paid by the company, and half was paid by me." The prosecutor then presented MacDonald with his own written confession, which contained statements about obtaining secret information from Sokolov, among other things. The prosecutor asked, "If you deny it today, why did you write it yourself at the time?" MacDonald replied, "Under the circumstances at the time, it was more convenient to write this confession." The number of people attending the trial was not as large as yesterday, as today was a regular workday. Upon hearing MacDonald's statement, they were all shocked. At the same time, the sound system suddenly broke down, making it even more difficult for listeners to understand the questions and answers. Furthermore, the meaning of MacDonald's statements was unclear in several places, requiring frequent calls for interpreters to explain. Yesterday, MacDonald appeared haggard and unwell, but today his demeanor was different. Although he limped slightly on his left foot, he stood upright before the court and denied the allegations in the indictment and in his own written confession in a calm and determined manner. At this point, the trial was adjourned for twenty minutes.</p>
<p>Upon resumption of the trial, the prosecutor cross-examined the defendant Thornton. Thornton denied all the charges. The prosecutor asked, "Did you hear the sound of the airplane engine?" Thornton replied, "Yes, the airplane engine did make a loud noise." The prosecutor said, "Why did you make incorrect statements before?" Thornton replied, "Because my nerves were disordered. The seriousness of the charges made me uneasy." The judge asked, "When did your nerves recover?" Thornton replied, "My nerves returned to normal on the evening of April 4th when I was released." Russian officials interrogated MacDonald and Thornton separately, but MacDonald claimed that he was unaware of any espionage activities by Monkhouse and Cushing. Thornton also stated that he was unaware of any sabotage or espionage by MacDonald, and if he had known, he would have fired MacDonald long ago. At this point, MacDonald suddenly shouted, "He knows about this espionage activity. His testimony this morning is full of contradictions, because MacDonald has been imprisoned for a long time and does not know the full situation."</p>
<p>After the second recess, MacDonald's condition changed again. When the prosecutor asked him whether he admitted to espionage, MacDonald admitted it in a low voice, saying that Thornton had initiated it and that other engineers in the company were also involved. He also admitted that he himself had issued orders to destroy machinery. The court then summoned Thornton to the stand. This time, the questioning was conducted by Deputy Prosecutor Roginsky, whose main purpose was to prove that Thornton had obtained secret information provided by Gussev through MacDonald. Thornton replied, "I don't think I ever instructed any engineer to seek secret information. I don't remember ordering Gussev to seek it either." The court then summoned MacDonald to the stand.</p>
<p>MacDonald directly admitted that he had obtained secret information from Gussev and passed it on to Thornton. The court repeatedly summoned MacDonald and Thornton to the stand, questioning them in turn. MacDonald admitted almost everything the prosecutor asked, while Thornton denied everything from beginning to end. Thornton claimed that he never received any military information from MacDonald, and that he only obtained information related to the Vickers Company. He had stated in his previous confession in prison that he and MacDonald had collected secret information, but he now wanted to delete the word "secret." The court then read out his confession, which implied that all the British engineers were involved in espionage. Thornton claimed that although he had written the document, he wanted to delete this section. Thornton said, "When I wrote this document, I didn't know what I was writing. It was a completely</p>
<p>unconscious text. What I saw and heard in a completely different environment frightened me and induced me to write this. I now wish to correct it." The prosecutor re-examined the two defendants about the money matters. Thornton presented written evidence proving that he had personally purchased fake cloth at a low price, and had lent money to MacDonald, as well as MacDonald's repayment of the loan. The prosecutor turned to MacDonald and asked if there were more than just this one instance of handling funds. MacDonald replied that there were more than just this one instance. The prosecutor asked MacDonald, "If one person in the Vickers Company had received funds for illegal activities, then others in the company must have known about it." MacDonald replied, "Yes." When Thornton was questioned about this, he denied that anyone in the company was involved in espionage, saying that the people in the company only collected harmless information. The prosecutor asked about the</p>
<p>definition of "espionage." Thornton replied, "Espionage is the act of seeking official secrets through illegal means." He also said, "What I can say with certainty now is that the confession I signed is not accurate and was written under mental pressure." The prosecutor asked lengthy questions again, asking Thornton whether he intended to carry out sabotage and slowdowns. Thornton replied, "I have always been engaged in construction and have never engaged in destruction." Thornton's answers remained unwavering. MacDonald, on the other hand, was extremely exhausted and could barely answer. When Monkhouse was questioned, he</p>
<p>firmly denied that he was guilty, and only knew that the company, in order to increase its profits, had given Durgoff, the general manager of the electrical appliance import company, 3,000 rubles. Monkhouse also said that the document he signed admitting to bribing Durgoff was not written by him. Gussev and his assistant Sokolov testified that they did not know Monkhouse and had never had any dealings with him. Finally, MacDonald stated that in prison, he had written to the Political Detective Bureau and the court with certain requests, but he did not wish to disclose the contents in court at this time. At this point, the court adjourned. A certain Russian observer whispered to the Reuters reporter, "Do you know that Soviet Russia has spent a total of 25 million rubles on this case? As for the amount of bribery involved in the case, it is only enough to buy a few typewriters." Chen Bozhi, the son of Chinese</p>
<p>Chen Youren, also attended the hearing today.</p>

<p>British House of Commons (Reuters, London, 13th) Before the British House of Commons adjourned for the Easter recess today, it discussed diplomatic matters. Foreign Secretary Simon mentioned the case of the six British people accused in Russia, stating that the six Vickers Company technicians had absolutely no contact with the British Detective Bureau. None of these six people were directly or indirectly employed by the British Detective Bureau, nor did they provide any information to the Detective Bureau, nor were they promised any compensation or expense money by the Detective Bureau to seek information, nor did any of these six people report any events to the British government on behalf of the Detective Bureau. The same is true of the Vickers Electrical Company itself. This company has never had any relationship with the Detective Bureau.</p>

<p>British Public Opinion Does Not Support Helping Germany Revise the Treaty of Versailles</p>
<p>Labour Party Leader Criticizes Simon for Ignoring the Sino-Japanese Dispute</p>
<p>(Reuters, London, 13th) The British House of Commons debated diplomatic matters before adjourning for the Easter recess today. Foreign Secretary Simon spoke of the Four-Power Pact, saying that he would soon be able to place documents related to this matter before the House for discussion.</p>
<p>The rumors circulating about this pact do not apply to the Rome talks. Some say that the British Prime Minister and he were induced to support the Italian plan. This is purely castles in the air. The British Prime Minister and he had only carefully studied the Italian plan. The British government is determined not to collude with any other country and impose its own will on others. Foreign Secretary Simon also spoke of the situation in Germany, saying that Britain now has an important concession, allowing German Jews to go to Palestine. The entire House, in view of the situation in Germany, expressed disapproval of the Four-Power Pact. Member of Parliament Attlee stated that he acknowledged that Germany was demanding fair treatment, but if Germany wanted to revise the treaty, it must show that it treated people fairly. Former Foreign Secretary Chamberlain stated that now is not the time to allow a country that claims that those who advocate peace or are Jewish are guilty to revise the treaty or grant concessions. Mrs. Rathbone, a non-partisan member representing British universities, stated that the malignant revival of Germany is not a blessing for world peace and freedom. Labour Party member Wedgwood stated that Germany itself has destroyed attempts to revise the treaty, but he asked Britain to allow victims in Germany to take refuge in Britain, as it has always done. Churchill stated that if Germany obtains complete military equality, the date for the resumption of the European War will not be far off. Foreign Secretary Simon made a reply to the above opinions, saying that Britain has the same feelings for the treatment of minorities in Germany. British officials in Palestine have issued licenses allowing 1,000 German working-class Jews to move to their Jewish homeland before the end of September. In the future, another 200 entry permits will be issued, allowing German Jews with capital of 1,000 pounds to enter. As for those with skills but without such capital, their entry may also be approved at discretion. At the end of the debate, Labour Party leader Lansbury criticized the Foreign Secretary for not saying a word about the Sino-Japanese dispute, and hoped that the Foreign Secretary would handle the matter as soon as possible. The House then adjourned until April 25.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Rome, 13th) Prussian Prime Minister Göring told reporters today that Germany has fully accepted the plan of the Four-Power Pact, saying, "I very much hope that the spirit of the agreement will not be changed.

Göring continued, saying that his intention in coming was to have a formal mission to seek ways to promote air traffic between Italy and Germany. However, according to Prussian Deputy Prime Minister Papen, who is also in Italy, his intention in coming was of a private nature, but he must have discussed the plan of the Four-Power Pact with Mussolini.</p>

<p>(National, Paris, 13th) Professor Einstein, since leaving German citizenship, has had the hope of being appointed professor of mathematical physics at a French university. Former French Prime Minister Paul Painlevé, a famous French mathematician and physicist who knew Einstein very well, specifically suggested to Education Minister Monsi, and Monsi proposed a bill in the Chamber of Deputies to establish a chair of mathematical physics specifically for Einstein and to invite Einstein to preside over it. The Chamber of Deputies has now passed the bill, and Einstein has also expressed his willingness to accept the appointment. The entire French public opinion has expressed satisfaction with the government's move. Only the Figaro newspaper has taken an opposing view, its reason being that Einstein had previously advocated anti-militaryism in Geneva.</p>

<p>(Dentsu, Tokyo, 14th) Finance Minister Takahashi's intention to resign is firm, and Prime Minister Saito's efforts to retain him are unlikely to succeed. Therefore, Prime Minister Saito seems to have resolved to reorganize and replenish the cabinet after the Finance Minister's resignation in order to continue to extend it. Some say that Wakatsuki, the president of the Minseito party, is secretly expected to join the cabinet and succeed him. The Seiyukai has hard-liners who claim that after Finance Minister Takahashi's resignation, cabinet members from the Seiyukai will all retreat, causing the cabinet to resign en masse. However, on the one hand, the Seiyukai seems reluctant to take responsibility for the failure to reorganize the cabinet. However, it seems that the attitude to be taken has not yet been decided. However, in late May, when the May 15th Incident is over, the political situation will be very turbulent due to Finance Minister Takahashi's resignation.</p>
<p>(Nichiren, Tokyo, 14th) The government will hold a local governors' conference on the 17th. Prime Minister Saito's main points of speech at the conference were formally decided after seeking the understanding of the cabinet members at today's cabinet meeting. The content is roughly as follows: (1) The political situation after the closure of the Diet has not yet resolved the state of emergency. The internal and external situation is becoming more serious. The current cabinet is determined to work hard and carefully handle the current situation. (2) Withdrawal from the League of Nations is an unavoidable action for Japan at present. Although Japan's policy towards Manchuria differs from the opinions of various countries, the future diplomatic policy still aims at world peace and remains absolutely unchanged. (3) Although the budget for Showa 8 is an unprecedentedly large budget, the government has established a solid financial plan and will not cause any root of disaster.

<p>On the Surface, It Is a Dispute Between the Puppet State and Soviet Russia</p>
<p>In Reality, It Is a Secret Struggle Between Japan and Russia</p>
<p>Even a Temporary Understanding Is Impossible</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: Recently, the relationship between the puppet state of Manchuria and Soviet Russia has become increasingly tense. This situation, on the surface, is a conflict between the puppet state and Soviet Russia, but in reality, it is a conflict of interests between Japan and Russia. Therefore, this kind of situation cannot be resolved in fact, and even a temporary understanding is difficult to establish. Aggravating each other, resentment is accumulating, and the points of contention are worth mentioning to the people of the country.</p>
<h3 id="e98">National Border Demarcation Issue <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>After the puppet state was established, it immediately planned to demarcate the national border with Soviet Russia. It is undoubtedly due to the instigation of the Japanese side. However, because military affairs were busy at the time, it was inconvenient to negotiate with the Russian side. After the fall of Rehe, the so-called puppet state territory has been completed. The Japanese side then instructed the puppet state to formally propose the issue of border demarcation to Soviet Russia, requesting the Russian side to send representatives to negotiate with the puppet state representatives. The Soviet Russian authorities originally knew the Japanese intention, and refused to discuss it on the grounds that they had not yet recognized the puppet state. The puppet state then sent Xie Bu-liu-bin from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs as a representative to Harbin to negotiate with the Russian side. According to the Russian newspapers here, Xie's visit was entrusted with the mission of promoting a meeting between Soviet Russia and the puppet state. The content was to be discussed by representatives from the three countries of Soviet Russia, the puppet state, and Japan. The scope of the discussion, in addition to the delineation of the borders between the three countries, also included the navigation rights of the Songhua River and the Kerulen River. The puppet state suggested that the meeting be held in Harbin, but the Russian side had neither clearly expressed this nor made any preparations. It is evident that this matter is still far from resolution, and it is unlikely to be realized in the near future.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Su Bingwen Issue <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>After General Su Bingwen retreated from northern Manchuria into Russian territory, the Japanese side instigated the puppet state to demand his extradition, which was rejected by the Russian side. The Japanese were extremely dissatisfied. Recently, the Soviet Russian authorities allowed General Su and about 1,000 of his subordinates to leave Russia and enter Rehe, which was obviously unfavorable to the puppet state. The Japanese believe that this move by Moscow is entirely an unfriendly attitude and suspect that it has a threatening effect. Therefore, they instigated the puppet state's Ministry of Foreign Affairs to order its representative in Harbin to lodge a serious protest with the Soviet Consul General in Harbin, but the Russian Consul Snovaski did not reply, saying that such a note should be submitted to the Soviet central government, and whether to reply should also be considered by Moscow.</p>

<p>Li, a secretary of the puppet state's consulate in Heihe, was arrested and detained for four hours by the local Russian police on March 27. He was released upon the request of Shi Hongchi, the consul of the consulate. The puppets of the puppet state regard this as a great insult and have decided to protest to Moscow. The details of Li's arrest are not yet known. The protest letter is still being studied, and it is difficult to predict how to word it or when to send it.</p>

<p>Koslersov, the Russian Deputy Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau, recently ordered the Russian section chief to detain several train heads and many railway materials that had entered Russian territory and not allow them to be returned. This matter is very serious. The puppet state government has sent the Deputy Minister of Transportation and the Chief of the Fifth Section of the Ministry of Transportation (both Japanese) to Harbin to investigate the truth and negotiate with Russia. The Director of the Chinese Eastern Railway Bureau (now appointed by the puppet state) has already submitted a written question to the Russian section chief of the railway on March 18, requesting a clear reply before noon on March 24, but the Russian section chief believes that there is no need to explain this matter and ignored it. The representatives of the Ministry of Transportation of the puppet state are extremely dissatisfied and have decided to stay for a few more days to negotiate directly with the Deputy Director of the railway. According to sources here, the representatives of the puppet state have already met with the Deputy Director, but have not obtained any key information. The Deputy Minister of the puppet state recently told people that he was very angry about the illegal detention of cars by the Russian side, saying that the arbitrary actions of the Russian section chief are absolutely unforgivable. If, in future negotiations, Russia still does not sincerely consider the legitimate demands of the puppet state, he will report all the facts to the puppet state government and await orders. The representative of the puppet state also solemnly declared that the puppet state government has established an overall plan for the development of Manchuria, and no matter what the attitude of the Russian side is, it will never change its policy. This statement is tantamount to demonstrating to the Russian side, but it is expected that the Russian authorities will not be intimidated by the Japanese, and it is feared that the conflict between Russia and Japan will become more apparent as a result.

<h3 id="e102">After the Loss of Lengkou, Our Army Increased Support and Counterattacked <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Our army temporarily retreated to a new position inside the pass.</p>
<p>Shang Zhen ordered that the lost territory be recovered within a time limit.</p>
<p>Luandong has been affected and has become tense.</p>
<p>A special dispatch from Beiping: After the Japanese army's invasion of Luandong failed, it launched a fierce attack on various passes of the Great Wall, and bombarded Fengfengkou and Gubeikou to contain our army's forces. On the other hand, it used its main forces to attack Lengkou fiercely. Our army's front was too long, and it divided its troops to defend against the enemy. The allocation of troops to various small passes was inevitably slightly thin. The Japanese used the puppet army to copy small roads, sneak into the pass, and disturb our rear. Our garrison in Lengkou fought fiercely with the enemy for three days and nights. Several people on the front were defeated, and Japanese puppet troops had rushed into the small passes on both wings. Our army, fearing encirclement, abandoned the Lengkou Changying area positions at 11:30 AM yesterday (11th) and retreated to Tiger Mountain and Guanyintang, etc., waiting for reinforcements to counterattack. Today (12th), some troops have been ordered to rush to the Lengkou area to reinforce the battle and strive to reverse the situation. Shang Zhen has also ordered his troops to restore Lengkou within a time limit. The course of the Lengkou battle is briefly described as follows:</p>
<p>The Japanese troops attacking Lengkou this time were the Hattori and Suzuki brigades and the Cheng Guorui's puppet army, totaling more than 10,000, with more than 30 aircraft, 40 to 50 artillery pieces, and 30 armored vehicles and tanks. The troops stationed in that area were two brigades of Shang Zhen's troops. The rear reserve team originally had some troops. Because of the emergency in Luandong, they were transferred to increase the force, so the force in that area was relatively thin. Starting on the 9th, the Japanese army began to invade, first using more than 30 aircraft and 40 to 50 mountain and field guns to bombard our outer positions fiercely, non-stop all day long. The fortifications of our outer positions were mostly destroyed by bombing. On the 10th, the Japanese puppet infantry and cavalry charged at our positions under the cover of artillery and aircraft. The two sides engaged in melee combat dozens of times. Our army fought bravely and killed many enemies. The enemy failed to succeed. The Japanese army knew that frontal attacks were not easy to invade, so they changed their strategy and again used aircraft and artillery to continuously bombard and explode our outer positions. The artillery fire and bombs were extremely fierce. The positions we built outside the pass were almost completely destroyed. At the same time, Japanese puppet infantry used smoke bombs to cover their attacks on our two wings, attacking our rear. Our garrison outside the pass, fearing being surrounded, had no choice but to abandon the positions outside the pass, retreat to the Lengkou pass, and set up defenses along the Great Wall. On the night of the 10th, more than 1,000 Japanese puppet troops sneaked into the Great Wall through Chenglingkou and advanced to Tuozitou, while some Japanese troops also broke in on the Dongjiakou side and invaded the Shui Lüezhuang and Xiaying area. By dawn on the 11th, battles had taken place in Taipingzhai, Dalingzhai Kou, and Xinzhuang, etc., in the rear of Lengkou. At the same time, the Japanese army on the Lengkou front fiercely bombarded our Lengkou area troops with aircraft and artillery. There were many casualties in the front and rear battles, totaling three days and nights. The rear troops, because of the interference of enemy aircraft and various difficulties, were not easy to reinforce. In addition, the enemy had penetrated deeply and was attacked from both sides. For the sake of gathering forces, Lengkou was temporarily abandoned and retreated to a certain new position. At 11:30 AM that morning, the troops in front of Lengkou retreated one after another, and Jianchangyingzi was also abandoned at the same time. After our army retreated to a new position, the Japanese army continued to advance, and battles also took place near Qian'an. The authorities here urgently transferred a large army to reinforce the area overnight. Today (12th), the reinforcements have arrived, and Shang Zhen ordered a counterattack in the morning, limiting his troops to recover Lengkou within 24 hours. The two sides are currently in fierce fighting.</p>
<p>Since the 9th at dawn, the Luandong aspect, our army launched a full-line counterattack, recaptured Haiyangzhen, and advanced north along the Liujiang Road. The vanguard troops have advanced to the line of the south bank of the Shihe River and the upper and lower Ping Mountains southwest of Shimen Village, as far as Liujiagou. Originally, it could have besieged Shimen and pursued the remnants of the enemy, but because the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on Lengkou Jieling and other places for several consecutive days, our army stopped chasing and stuck to the Tanghe coast for the sake of responding to each other. Since the fall of Lengkou, the Japanese army has penetrated deeply, and Qian'an and Lulong are in a state of emergency at the same time. The situation in Luandong has suddenly become tense. In case of changes in the rear, the armies on the Luandong front will inevitably be affected. At the same time, the Japanese army in the Shimen Village area has also completed its replenishment and has a tendency to invade again. (April 12)</p>
<h3 id="e103">Zhang Boling Talks About the Current Situation in North China, Special Correspondent Geng Ya <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>After the reporter arrived in Tianjin, he immediately visited Mr. Zhang Boling, the president of the Tianjin Local Association. Mr. Zhang suffered from rheumatism in his right arm, but he still received the reporter and had a long conversation. Mr. Zhang immediately took a map and described it orally, roughly saying, "Japanese soldiers continue to occupy our four northeastern provinces without bloodshed, with their heads held high. They originally wanted to invade the Great Wall, intending to invade Chahar and Sui with great force. However, after the unified and courageous resistance of our Song Zheyuan and Shang Zhen's troops, they recaptured several lost key passes, and thus the morale was greatly boosted, and the enemy was also intimidated. Now the defenses around the Great Wall are roughly Gubeikou for the 部 部 troops, Xifengkou for the 部 troops, Lengkou Luanhe Qian'an area for the 部 troops, Zhangjiakou Duolun area for the 部 troops, and Guyuan for the 部 troops. All are strictly disciplined and have the assistance of the local people. Although Tianjin has Japanese troops stationed there due to the Boxer Protocol, the river channel is shallow and easy to silt, making it difficult for warships to enter. Moreover, Mr. Yu Xuezhong's national army has made preparations. If the enemy troops dare to invade, they will be met with strong resistance. The section of the Beining Railway from Tanggu to Linyu is under the threat of Japanese naval artillery fire. Therefore, He Zhuguo's army withdrew from Shimen Village to Luandong, but not because of defeat. Japan also has the Kailuan Mining Company run by the British in the area, fearing to arouse international resentment, so it completely delegated the responsibility of capturing Luandong to the puppet organization Li Jichun's troops. As for Beiping, with Zhang Xueliang's resignation, it seems relatively eased at the moment. It is expected that the center of the future war will gradually shift to Duolun Dushikou and other places, in order to complete the Japanese invasion policy of instigating the Mongolians to establish a "Ancient Map". However, I am afraid that our army in places such as Xifengkou will cut off their retreat, so the Japanese army may advance westward along the Pingyu Avenue, maneuvering and circling with the defenders of our Great Wall. It is also uncertain. We have only three routes to take in response to this serious situation: one is direct negotiation, the second is to recover the lost territory, and the third is to resist to the death. However, given the current bad international situation, even if the government wants to compromise and negotiate, the people will definitely resolutely oppose it. As for recovering the lost territory, we are not sufficiently prepared militarily or economically, so there is no point in talking about it. It is undeniable, so the only grand avenue is to resist desperately. Resist for self-defense, and fight for justice. There will eventually be a day when we win the final victory. Zhang Xueliang's non-resistance in the past, whether it was a merit or a crime, is clear. There is no need to bother saying anything. Tang Yulin disobeyed the order because Wan Fulin disobeyed the order, did not retreat to Chengde, and retreated to Xifengkou, so he also abandoned Chengde, causing him to become the target of public criticism. In fact, those who should be held responsible for the loss of Rehe are not just Tang alone. There are also many people whose crimes are greater than Tang's. These people use the government's vague attitude towards Japan as an excuse to watch and wait, wanting to preserve their strength, and all have plausible arguments. They do not know that foreign aggression is not like internal strife. Preserving strength in internal strife may be possible, but preserving strength when foreign aggression comes and not hesitating to lead thieves into the house will ultimately be abandoned by everyone. On the contrary, if we can embrace the spirit of sacrifice and resolutely resist Japan, we will surely win the sympathy of the people of the country. This is very similar to the meaning of the New Testament saying that 'he who wants to gain his life must lose it.' Due to special political relations, the government is unable to punish derelict soldiers, resulting in the decline of military discipline like a river flowing downhill. If the government can have clear rewards and punishments, not only will such shameless soldiers not be produced in the first place, but the Japanese army will never dare to be so unscrupulous. Now that the government has no clear rewards and punishments, the responsibility of the people is invisibly increased. In other words, for those officers and soldiers who fight bravely and achieve outstanding results on the front lines, they should be given as much assistance as possible in terms of manpower and material resources. Donating money, no matter one yuan or half a mao, can express a great meaning. That is, the joyful donation of each person and each share is no different from casting a most honorary ballot for the heroic soldiers who are fighting for the survival of the nation on the front lines. On the one hand, it can express the enthusiastic sympathy of the people, and on the other hand, it can encourage the courage of the soldiers to thoroughly recognize the anti-imperialist struggle as a glorious war of great value. Furthermore, the compensation and education of the families of the soldiers should be treated even more preferentially than the families of the victims of the civil war, which is reasonable. If the people can uphold justice in this way and hide the profound meaning of encouragement and punishment in the assistance, I know that the brave soldiers will be encouraged to work harder because of this, and the cowardly ones will also know to be cautious because of this, sweeping away the past decadent atmosphere and revitalizing the morale of the new forces. In addition, there are two things that the military and civilians should thoroughly realize: the army must first seek sincere cooperation with the people before it can win outside the border. Tang Yulin's army usually accumulated resentment among the people through bad governance, leading to the great disaster of losing land and harming the country. This is the recent lesson. Furthermore, the most common problem among Chinese people is that they always pursue false fame and do not seek reality. As a result, they often fail to succeed in anything. I hope that all Chinese people will unite to cure this disease. The future of the country and the nation will be almost certain."</p>

<p>Regarding the review report, it is found that the case of Shao Hongji, a committee member, impeaching Wei Daoming, the former mayor of Nanjing, for bribery, malfeasance, and dereliction of duty, has been reviewed by the committee members. The review concluded that the bribery was indeed established, the facts were obvious, the dereliction of duty was undeniable, and the impeached person Wei Daoming should be transferred to disciplinary action immediately. The criminal part should be handed over to the court for strict investigation and prosecution, and ordered to be responsible for compensating all losses, in order to warn against corruption and clean up officialdom.

<h3 id="e106">Original Proposal Text <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the proposal, it has been found that since the Nanjing Municipal Government of this city discovered that the treasury receipts for collecting housing donations, etc., were forged and there was malfeasance, the entire case has been transferred to the Jiangning District Court for investigation, which has caused considerable suspicion. The capital is located in the capital, and it is urgent to thoroughly investigate it in order to clarify the truth. The committee members immediately went to the Municipal Government, Jiangning District Court, and the citizens to conduct open and secret investigations. It is now found that the Municipal Finance Bureau used three-part receipts to collect various donations in the past. After Mayor Wei Daoming took office, he abolished the three-part receipts and changed to the current two-part treasury receipts of the Municipal Finance Bureau to collect various donations. The receipts were stamped by the Citizen Bank and used to collect housing donations, shop donations, and vehicle donations from the citizens. This was intended to prevent malfeasance by collection personnel, which was indeed a good law and a good intention. Unexpectedly, the opposite was true. Since the use of the two-part treasury receipts, it has indeed been a way to deceive the people of the city with treasury receipts, and to create a large-scale malfeasance case with organization and planning, with those above and below engaging in collusion. If the interior is not leaked, outsiders will never know. Now, if the municipal authorities are willing to collude in malfeasance, this case will never be exposed. Only the details of the forgery of receipts and malfeasance obtained from the investigation are described as follows: (A) Regarding the forgery of treasury receipts, it has been found that the treasury receipts were originally entrusted by the Municipal Government to a printing bureau in Nanjing to be printed in Shanghai, and then sent by the Municipal Government to the Citizen Bank to be stamped, and then used to collect various donations from the citizens. The forged treasury receipts were probably copied and printed by the original printing person who was entrusted. The genuine and fake are slightly different, and it is not easy for outsiders to identify. Moreover, fake bank seals are also forged and stamped on them, or fake seals are used to stamp genuine receipts. On the one hand, fake receipts are used to collect donations, and on the other hand, fake receipts are used to replace genuine receipts. Then, the genuine receipt stubs are used to replace the fake receipt stubs for reporting, or the fake receipt stubs are used to replace the genuine receipt stubs for reporting. There are about a dozen types of malfeasance methods. In short, fake is mixed with genuine, and genuine is mixed with fake, trying to do everything possible to commit malfeasance. The city needs about 60,000 treasury receipts every month. If the number of forgeries is estimated at 20% of the lowest number, about 12,000 fake receipts are used every month. If each receipt is estimated to have a minimum of two yuan of malfeasance, about 28,000 yuan is embezzled every month, which is already alarming, but I am afraid that it is more than this number. This relates to the situation of forgery and malfeasance. (B) Regarding the malfeasance of collection personnel, it has been found that the municipal revenue of this city is mainly from housing donations. There is no proportion of how much is collected every month, and there is no statistics every year. The collection personnel are allowed to fabricate reports at will, as much or as little as they want. With such a large revenue, how could the municipal authorities in the past have been deaf and blind, and turn a deaf ear to it? This can prove the reason for collusion between those above and below. Also, it has been found that there are about 50 collection personnel in the Municipal Finance Bureau, who hold treasury receipts to collect housing donations, shop donations, or vehicle donations from citizens every month. Some give fake receipts, and some give genuine receipts. For example, if the first collector issues a fake receipt to the citizen, the second collector will not collect if he sees a fake receipt, or if the first collector issues a genuine receipt to the citizen, the second collector will not collect if he sees that it has already been collected. Moreover, the receipts are not signed or stamped, which is clear evidence of the collusion of collection personnel. Furthermore, the receipt stubs of the treasury receipts returned by the collection personnel are mixed with genuine and fake ones, the numbers are disordered, and there is no report of the number of receipts received and spent, and the remaining number, nor is there a report form for the amount of money collected. However, the person who issues and receives the receipts and the accountant have never raised any objections. Even the audit department of the Municipal Government has not found a single forged receipt. This receipt has passed through the hands of more than a dozen people from the time it was issued and returned to the time it was audited and filed, for several years, and no one has been heard to know and report it. This is clear evidence of the collusion of those above and below in committing malfeasance, without any doubt. From this, it can be known that it is an organized, planned, and entire large-scale malfeasance case, which is not an exaggeration. Based on the above facts, if the mayors and finance directors in the past were unaware, how could the audit personnel of the municipal government and all the relevant collection staff of the finance bureau dare to commit malfeasance for three years, embezzling public funds of about one million yuan, until it was discovered last month? Although the municipal government has handed over the personnel involved in the collection and use of fake receipts to the court for trial, it has failed to thoroughly investigate the principal offenders, which is not in accordance with the fairness of the law. Also, it has been found that Wei Hanqing, an official in the finance bureau in charge of treasury receipts during Mayor Wei's tenure, reported the loss of 82 waste tickets for 100 yuan shops, 507 waste tickets for 10 yuan shops, 15 waste tickets for 100 yuan households, and 300 waste tickets for 10 yuan households, totaling 904 tickets, with a face value of 17,770 yuan. He did not check the starting and ending numbers of the lost tickets, but vaguely reported them, which was obviously to reserve a place for future malfeasance. The mayor knew this but did not investigate it, nor did he announce it or publish a statement in the newspaper to declare it invalid, but simply approved it in one batch. The hidden situation is self-evident. It has been proven by the court's investigation of this lost ticket that it has now been found on the market collecting donations, which is sufficient to prove that Wei Daoming is undoubtedly the principal offender in condoning malfeasance and forging official documents and seals. All the former mayors Wei Daoming and the former finance directors Qi Xu, Wang Renlin, and Cheng Yuanfan, etc., are not only derelict in their duties, but are in fact colluding in malfeasance, which is unforgivable by law. Therefore, I hereby impeach them in accordance with the law and request that Wei Daoming, Qi Xu, Wang Renlin, Cheng Yuanfan, and Wei Hanqing, etc., be transferred to disciplinary action immediately, and request that the embezzled public funds be strictly recovered, and that the relevant criminal part be immediately handed over to the court for trial, in order to emphasize the rule of law and rectify officialdom. This is presented to the President for review and implementation, Shao Hongji, Supervisor.</p>

<p>Regarding the review report, the case of Committee Member Shao Hongji impeaching Wei Daoming, the former mayor of Nanjing, and the former finance directors Qi Xu, Wang Renlin, Cheng Yuanfan, etc., for forging receipts and embezzling money has been handed over to the committee members for review. The committee members have reviewed it in detail and all agree that the Municipal Government of this city discovered that there were forgeries and malfeasance in the treasury receipts for collecting housing donations, etc. The genuine and fake receipts have been kept in the court for investigation and prosecution. Furthermore, Committee Member Shao personally investigated and found that the number of forgeries has not been determined, but even if calculated at the lowest limit, the amount of floating receipts every month is about 28,000 yuan, and those above and below have been deceiving each other for three years. As the city government agency in the capital, a major malfeasance case has occurred, and it is necessary to investigate its responsibility thoroughly. Although the municipal government has handed over the relevant people involved in the collection of receipts to the court for trial, the people in charge at the time, even if they were the principal offenders in malfeasance and forging official documents and seals, have been allowed to go unpunished, which is not in accordance with the fairness of the law. It is requested that the impeached former mayor Wei Daoming, former finance directors Qi Xu, Wang Renlin, Cheng Yuanfan, and the treasury receipt official Wei Hanqing be handed over to disciplinary action immediately, and that the relevant criminal part be transferred to the court for trial, in order to clear up the accumulated malpractices and warn against future evils.

<p>Zou Xiaogong, the administrative inspector of the Third District of Jiangsu, issued a proclamation on the 14th to Changshu, Kunshan, and Wujiang counties. The main idea of the proclamation is that if there are corrupt local tyrants who disrupt local public security, the people are allowed to accuse them according to law. Once verified, they will be severely punished according to law without pardon. He also instructed the county magistrates not to accept bribes or engage in malfeasance.</p>
<h3 id="e111">Chamber of Commerce Strives for Telephone Deposit Fee <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>The Wuxian Chamber of Commerce considered the additional deposit fee charged by the Suzhou Telephone Bureau to be illegal. It had submitted a request to the Ministry of Communications, requesting the Ministry to order the Suzhou Telephone Bureau to correct it and reduce the burden on merchants. Subsequently, the Ministry approved the request. Yesterday, the Chamber of Commerce submitted the case to a joint executive and supervisory meeting for deliberation. It was decided that the deposit fee should be 20 yuan. Those who have paid will not be increased, and those who have not paid in full will be required to pay the difference. The case will be submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval and implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e112">Villagers Demolish the Defense Corps Headquarters <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Villagers of Gangxia Township, the seventh district under this county, had pooled funds to perform a Tanhuang opera about ten days ago and hired a famous Tanhuang troupe to perform in the village. Having obtained the consent of the township head, who also served as the head of the Defense Corps, they began the performance, which lasted for two days. However, the squad leader of the Defense Corps, believing that it was detrimental to public morals and indirectly involved gambling and harboring bandits, strongly advocated for its prohibition. The head of the corps, feeling constrained by public opinion, had no choice but to order the performance to stop. This caused a group of villagers to resent the Defense Corps squad leader and call for revenge. Soon, over a thousand people gathered within an hour. Among them was Zang Xing, who ran a teahouse, who declared they should take up arms. So, everyone took up hoes, rakes, and clubs as weapons and stormed the Defense Corps. They tore up all the documents, letters, and uniforms, and even seized firearms. Several militiamen were beaten and injured. Afterwards, militiamen from the Defense Corps arrested two villagers, Sun Lvkang and Sun Shunjin, who were involved in the violence, intending to take them to the city for legal proceedings. However, the township head mediated between the two sides, ordering Zang Xing and Sun Lvkang, etc., to raise 328 yuan to compensate the Defense Corps for the losses. The lost firearms were also recovered from the river and returned to the corps headquarters.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Bandits Rob Two Pig Boats in Succession <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Hua Afa, a resident of Liuxiang, Zhangjing Township, the fifth district in the north (Tianshang City) of this county, makes a living by steering pig boats. The other day, at dusk, Liu Afa's pig boat and Wang Laowu's pig boat, from Jiangbei, were both loading pigs in Jiangbei to come to Xixi. They anchored in Zhangjing Creek overnight. Unexpectedly, in the middle of the night, four or five bandit boats suddenly came. More than ten bandits swarmed aboard, tied up the owners and crew of the two pig boats, and robbed them of more than 70 yuan in cash and 38 large pigs. After the bandits had plundered enough, they set sail and fled. Afterwards, Yang Zuxun, the head of the fourth Jia of the Sitou Town Defense Corps in the district, led militiamen and intercepted two bandit boats at the No. 3 Bridge on the Xicheng Road. They found 13 large pigs in the boats and arrested a deaf-mute suspect. They presented these all together to the Fifth District Corps Headquarters and yesterday submitted a written report to the county government for review.</p>

<p>The Zoumatang Defense Corps in the ninth district of Wuyi recently received a tip-off that a large number of bandits were gathering and dispersing irregularly in the vicinity and had committed robberies in several households. They immediately dispatched teams to search in all directions. On the 11th and 12th, they successively captured a number of bandits, including Yang Genfa, Ma Yinpei, Hou Bingli, and Guan A'da, in Pangjia Street and other places, along with two rifles, seven bullets, and five bundles of clothing totaling 118 pieces. Another bandit, Ma Jinlin, drowned while trying to escape by swimming when being captured. The suspects were taken to the corps for preliminary interrogation and all confessed to robbing the families of Wu Guixu and Xu Genmao, etc. The district office then handed over the suspects, stolen goods, and other items to the county on the 13th for interrogation.</p>

<p>Hu Fengshan, the captain of the Zhenjiang County Government Police Brigade, was transferred here from Pi County last spring and has served for more than a year. Now, the Civil Affairs Department has decided that the original police captain of Pi County has been transferred to Jiangdu, and the vacancy should be filled by Captain Hu to make use of his expertise. The vacancy left behind will be filled by Deputy Captain Bu Zhenhai on an acting basis. After receiving the order, the Zhenjiang County Government ordered Captain Hu to complete the handover yesterday, and Captain Bu took over the duties.</p>

<p>The Zhenjiang County Agricultural Experiment Station is handling the planting of roadside trees on the third section of Zhongzheng Road and Jingji Road in the provincial capital. The station specifically selected 400 black locust trees and planted them along the road. The work has now been completed and a request has been submitted to the Zhenjiang County Government to forward it to the Department of Construction for inspection. After receiving the report, the Department of Construction has sent Xie Mingke, a forestry technician from the department, to inspect and accept the work.</p>

<p>The Jiangsu Department of Construction previously received a report from the Provincial Silkworm Industry Regulation Office stating that there have been reports of qualified certificates issued to various seed production sites being misused by others in the past. To prevent problems from arising, it is proposed that the qualified certificates issued this year should not only be printed with the words "Jiangsu Year 22 Spring Stable", but also be printed with separate labels on the qualified certificates for ordinary seeds or original silkworm seeds used by each site, so that each site cannot misuse them to prevent abuses. The Department of Construction now considers the proposed measures to be feasible and has approved them for record.</p>

<p>Fan Hengsheng, a notorious bandit from the northern countryside, has recently led a group to commit robberies in over a hundred cases, killing many victims. Most recently, he robbed the Sun family in Banqiao in the southern countryside and killed three people. The other day, the Suppression Team learned of Fan's whereabouts, rushed to arrest him, and brought him to the county for interrogation. He confessed to leading the gang to commit murder without any denial. The豫鄂皖Tri-Province General Headquarters were telegraphed to approve his execution on the spot. On the 9th, County Magistrate Wang took Fan (nicknamed Mud Loach Head) to parade through the streets as a warning to the public and tied him to the Cai Da Tang execution ground for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>Wang Jingwei Came to Shanghai Yesterday Morning to Persuade Him</p>
<p>Domestic Finance Temporarily Handled by Li Tiao</p>
<p>Wang Talks About No Direct Contact Between China and Japan</p>
<p>Negotiating While Resisting</p>
<p>Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan, together with his wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and the Ministry of Railways</p>
<p>Departed from Beijing by night train and arrived in Shanghai. Mr. Wang visited Song Ziwen twice yesterday to urge him to</p>
<p>Talks. As a result, Song has already agreed in person and will set sail for the United States within the next few days. As for Song's</p>
<p>Financial issues have been largely decided to be handled by Zhang Shuyong, Financial Advisor, and Financial Secretary</p>
<p>The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e121">Visit to Song Ziwen <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Wang Jingwei, President of the Executive Yuan, and his wife, together with Zeng Zhongming, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Railways, arrived in Shanghai from Beijing by overnight express train at about 11:00 p.m. and arrived at Zhenru Station at 7:40 a.m. yesterday. Before leaving Beijing, President Wang had telegraphed Finance Minister Song Ziwen to come to Shanghai to discuss the matter of attending the Washington Economic Conference in person. Therefore, Mr. Song sent Tang Haian, the Jianghai Customs Supervisor, to Zhenru Station to welcome Mr. Wang yesterday morning, and they went to visit Song on Qiqi Road in the same car. Wang's wife, Ms. Chen Bijun, and Mr. Zeng Zhongming took their own cars and returned to Wang's residence on Pushi Road. After Wang and others arrived at Song's residence, they met with Song Ziwen. Wang earnestly requested Mr. Song to serve as our country's representative to attend the Washington Economic Conference. Mr. Song initially declined and suggested Sun Ke instead. After Mr. Wang explained that Sun Min is currently tied up with the work of the Legislative Yuan and cannot leave, and that Mr. Song has been in charge of finance for many years and is more suitable, and that all parties have high expectations for Song, he asked Song to reluctantly take on the difficult task. Soon, Xu Mo, the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, also arrived. The three gentlemen talked for a long time, and Song agreed to consider it before making a decision. At 9:35, Wang and Xu left one after another. By 4:30 yesterday afternoon, Wang borrowed the residence of Li Shizeng, a member of the Central Committee, and visited Song's residence again to continue discussing the issue of attendance. The three gentlemen talked for about two hours, and Song finally agreed to serve as a representative. It was also largely decided that after Song leaves the country, the military expenses and financial issues in North China will be temporarily managed by Zhang Shuyong, a senior advisor to the Ministry of Finance, and Li Tiaosheng and Zou Lin, the financial secretaries. Wang and Li left at 6:20 p.m.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Going Abroad in a Few Days <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>As a result of the consultation between Wang and Song, Mr. Song decided to leave Shanghai to go abroad within the next few days. Those traveling with him will probably be Dr. Yang Ge, the American advisor to the Ministry of Finance, and a few secretaries. Because Mr. Song considered the domestic financial issues to be extremely important after he left Shanghai, he invited Zhang Shuyong to meet at Song's residence at 5:30 yesterday afternoon. The two gentlemen talked until about 7:00 p.m. before leaving.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Wang's Talk <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>At 10:30 yesterday morning, our reporter visited Wang Jingwei at his residence. According to Wang, the purpose of his trip to Shanghai was entirely to urge Minister Song Ziwen to represent our country to go to the United States to attend the Washington Conference, because this Washington Conference is of great importance. All countries in the world have sent first-class figures to participate, such as British Prime Minister MacDonald and French former Prime Minister Herriot. Therefore, the choice of our country's candidates should be particularly careful. The Central Committee originally planned to choose one of the two gentlemen, Finance Minister Song Ziwen and Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, to attend. However, Mr. Sun is the President of the Legislative Yuan, and the organizational law of the Provisional National Congress, the election law of the National Congress, and the draft constitution must be formulated before July 1st. Therefore, no matter what, he cannot get away, let alone go abroad. The Central Committee then decided to invite Song to go, and because Song is our country's financial authority and is familiar with the world's economic situation, this position is even more suitable. However, at this time of national crisis, the raising of military expenses in North China and other financial issues are also extremely important. If Mr. Song can make the trip, he should make considerable preparations before leaving the country. I met with Mr. Song this morning, and I will visit him again in the afternoon. A final decision can be made tonight (that is, last night). I will return to Beijing the same night or tomorrow after Mr. Song agrees in person.</p>
<h3 id="e124">Issue of Political Prisoners <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Wang then talked about the issue of opening up political rights, saying that Ms. Song Qingling, Mrs. Sun, came to Beijing last time as a representative of the China League for Civil Rights to request two points from the government: (1) Release all political prisoners in the country; (2) Abolish the singular law. I met with Mrs. Sun in person at that time, explained in detail, and repeatedly stated in a long letter that the main point is that regarding the first point, the Central Committee convened the Second Plenary Session last year and discussed this issue, and the National Crisis Conference has already gathered people from all walks of life with different political views to participate in the discussion together, and in fact they have all been pardoned. Therefore, there are no so-called political prisoners in prison now. If there are any, they are the communists who have been arrested in the past. The communists are now causing trouble everywhere and plotting to subvert the country, so they cannot be treated the same as ordinary political prisoners. As for what is meant by abolishing the singular law, it refers to the Law on Punishing Crimes Endangering the Republic of China in Emergency Situations. This article is also specifically designed for the communists today. Just look at the countries in Europe and America. Because the communists do not have riots and other situations, there are regulations on freedom of speech and publication. However, the situation of the communists in China today has gone beyond the scope of riots, so how can they be compared with other countries?</p>
<h3 id="e125">Southwest Decides to Send Troops <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then asked President Wang about the issue of sending troops from the Southwest to resist Japan and suppress bandits. According to Wang, I met with Yang Dezhao, the representative of Chen Jitang, yesterday and learned that the Southwest is still proceeding with the original plan to send troops to resist Japan and suppress communists. Some people in Guangdong are opposed to the Provisional National Congress because of misunderstandings, which have been explained by the Central Committee in a telegram. I have not heard of the rumor that the Central Committee will send Minister Huang to Hong Kong to explain the matter. After Chiang, the chairman, personally went to supervise the suppression of bandits in Jiangxi, the bandit forces have been slightly weakened. After Chairman Chiang has properly deployed the military to suppress bandits, he will go north to command the resistance against Japan.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Public Remarks <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Wang also made public remarks at the same time: Question: There have been many rumors about Sino-Japanese compromise recently. What is the truth? Answer: Indeed, there are rumors, but I believe that people with common sense can easily judge what is a rumor and what is a fact. May I ask how China and Japan can compromise? Will Japan abandon its aggressive acts in the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, and abolish the puppet government of Manchuria? Does China recognize Japan's aggressive acts in the three northeastern provinces and Rehe, and recognize the puppet government of Manchuria? Since Japan is unwilling to do the former and China is unwilling to do the latter, may I ask how can they compromise? Question: You advocate that resistance and negotiation should be carried out at the same time. Are you still adhering to this policy now? Answer: I am still adhering to this policy. First, let's talk about resistance. We certainly cannot say that we are sure of victory, but we must do our best to resist. This can be said with certainty. Since Chairman Chiang went north to supervise the military in North China and the generals of all armies are united in resisting the enemy, although we cannot say that there has been great progress, it is stronger than the Battle of Rehe. This is a fact that can be proven. We are determined to resist and do our best to resist. We do not exaggerate small victories and do not become discouraged by temporary failures. Only in this way can we achieve the goal of long-term resistance. Second, let's talk about negotiation. Recently, the League of Nations has made a resolution to impose moral sanctions on Japan. Military sanctions may not be able to be determined for a while in fact, but they are a natural step in principle. If not, moral sanctions will become empty words. Speaking of rumors just now, I am reminded of one thing. Have you seen the recent arguments in Japanese newspapers? They say that China is still actively resisting Japan and that Japan must attack Guan Nei. Comparing this argument with the so-called rumors makes people feel very emotional. I advise the people to pay attention to the arguments in the Japanese media rather than paying attention to rumors, so that they can have a clearer understanding of the other party. I would also like to say that not all Japanese people support the invasion of China. The most correct argument is that if this invasion continues, it will lead to "the common demise of China and Japan." How earnest are their words! I believe that today, in addition to resistance, we must awaken all countries in the world to impose strong sanctions on Japan's aggressive actions, and we must also awaken the powerful forces in Japan to stop their own aggressive actions. This is the effort we should make. Question: Recently, there have been rumors that the government is unwilling to fully accommodate opinions from all parties on the major policies of peace and war, resulting in many misunderstandings. Even the central committee members and military committee members have such arguments. What is the actual situation? Answer: The national crisis is so serious that speaking of war, there is the danger of losing soldiers and land; speaking of peace, there is the danger of losing power and humiliating the country; speaking of neither peace nor war, there is danger in both. Therefore, the people who are currently in Nanjing politics are as anxious as if they are throwing themselves into a fire pit. We are determined to go to the country's difficulties together and jump into the fire pit. At the same time, we are only grateful and motivated when we see people jumping into the fire pit together. There is no reason to reject them. All kinds of conferences are now sincerely inviting people who should attend and attend to come to attend. In other words, we are sincerely inviting comrades to jump into the fire pit together. If some of the comrades cannot come due to job responsibilities, and communication cannot be fully clarified, resulting in misunderstandings, we are very sorry and will only try to remedy these shortcomings. We will never believe that in this time of national peril, there will still be people standing far away outside the fire pit, making sarcastic remarks. If there are, we have no choice, but we must know that if the Nanjing government collapses, it is not the collapse of one person, but the collapse of the entire government. If you think that after the Nanjing government collapses, you can still maintain half of the country in the Northwest, Southwest, and Southeast (not to mention the Northeast because the Northeast is gone), I am afraid there is no such good dream. As far as I am concerned, before the September 18th Incident, I disagreed with many comrades in Nanjing because of the promotion of policies. But after the September 18th Incident, I only buried my head and jumped into the fire pit. I have recently returned, not because I am confident in saving the country, but because I think that at least jumping into the fire pit will allow me to die at ease.</p>

They returned to Shanghai the other day. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency visited Mr. Yang Xingfu yesterday. According to him, the association has sent another letter to Wang and Luo, requesting that they be handled according to the law. The following is a record of Mr. Yang's remarks and the reasons:</p>

<p>According to Mr. Yang Xingfu's talk with the reporter, the process of going to the capital with Mr. Song Qingling the other day to visit President Wang and Director Luo to request various items, and to visit the situation of the Niu Lan couple, Luo Yu, Chen Chen, Huang Ping, and others, has been reported to the league, which has been seen in the newspapers yesterday. After we returned to Shanghai and reported, the league decided to formally write to President Wang and Minister Luo again, requesting that they find a way to transfer the suspects to the formal court for handling according to the law. The original letter is as follows:</p>

<p>Mr. Jingwei, Mr. Junren,鉴, The four persons who were arrested on suspicion of communism and escorted from Shanghai to Beijing, Luo Dengxian, Yu Wenhua, Chen Guang, and Chen Shuying, etc., have recently learned that they are still detained in the Capital Gendarmerie Headquarters. It is heard that they were sent there by the Central Party Headquarters.承先生电允, to be handled according to the law,務盻鼎力, immediately transferred to the formal court for handling according to the law, in order to 重民权而维法治精神, the future of civil rights protection,实深利赖, 專泐,敬颂公安, and 候覆音,</p>

<p>According to Yang, after the National Self-Defense Association's venue was searched by the concession authorities, four of the association's lecturers in Pudong were also arrested. After the China League for Civil Rights received the news of the search and arrests, it held a meeting on April 12 to discuss the matter and appointed Shen Junru, a lawyer, to negotiate with the Chinese Concession authorities. It is also heard that the chairman of the Self-Defense Association was recommended to be Mr. Song Qingling, but Mr. Song declined to take on the position because he could not take care of other work at the same time. As for Mr. Cai Yuanpei, he is neither a founder of the association nor an employee of the association. The rumor that he is a backbone member of the association is probably a misunderstanding.</p>

<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, a gentleman from the Grand Canal Engineering Bureau came to Shanghai yesterday and talked about the Grand Canal flood control and repair matters.

<h3 id="e132">Shanghai Telephone Bureau Will Switch to Automatic Telephones Today <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>And Increase the Number of Concession Lines by Eleven Pairs</p>
<p>Convenient for All City Users, No Increase in Fees</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau's automatic telephone has been installed and will officially start operation at 12:00 midnight on the 15th of this month. Communication lines have been improved and increased for communication between the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Concession areas. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Official Operation <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>The Telephone Bureau announced that the automatic telephone was being upgraded and installed. Three years have passed, and the project has been delayed many times due to various factors. Now, in compliance with the Ministry's order, we have urged the progress and have completed all work in the Nanshi and Zhabei districts. It is scheduled to officially open communication at 12:00 midnight on the 15th of this month. Before 12:00, users must still report their numbers as before. After 12:00, they can use the converter. During the transition between the old and new systems, there may be some obstacles. Please be kind and considerate. In addition, users should prepare a new phone book and bring the notification issued by the bureau with the official seal before 12:00 noon on the 15th to the bureau to collect it. This is to notify you.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Increase in Communication Lines <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency met with Xu Xueyu, the director of the telephone bureau. According to him, the automatic telephone will officially start operation at 12:00 midnight on the 15th. At the same time, communication lines will be increased. For example, from Nanshi to Zhabei, the original 19 pairs of lines were rented from the Concession Telephone Company, with each pair costing 50 taels. In view of the fact that communication was insufficient during communication, for the convenience of citizens, a consultation was held with the Concession Telephone Company, and it was decided that starting from the 15th, the number of lines will be increased to 30 pairs, and the rental fee for each pair will increase from 50 taels to 200 taels. At that time, there will be no sense of insufficient application.</p>
<h3 id="e135">Concession Communication <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>As for communication with the concession, users originally had to notify the Shanghai Telephone Bureau's manual operator, and then the manual operator would notify the Concession Telephone Company's manual operator to transfer to the user. The procedure was cumbersome and would inevitably take a long time. For the sake of speed, it has been decided that when the automatic machine is in communication, users will notify the telephone bureau's manual operator, and the manual operator will directly transfer to the user. At the same time, the original 19 pairs of telephone lines will be increased to 30 pairs. A deposit of 5 yuan will still be required in advance, and the fee will be 5 cents per three minutes.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau has more than 140 male and female switchboard operators. After the automatic machine is used, it is inevitable that the number of operators will be reduced. It has now been decided to re-employ the best operators based on their performance, character, and length of service by means of an examination, about 100 of them. The bureau will be responsible for recommending the rest to telephone bureaus in the interior for employment.</p>

The Canal Engineering Bureau previously sent technician Xu Demao, together with Lu Keming, a technician from the Department of Construction, to re-estimate the urgent and dangerous works (excluding secondary works), which will cost at least 72,000 yuan. Although the government ordered that it be paid from the Mudian fund for governing the canal, the Department of Finance has not yet approved it. There is no room for reduction in the construction cost, and there is still no progress. Thinking back to the breach of the canal two years ago, the future is very worrying. The director of the bureau, Zuo Dingkang, has already politely discussed the matter with Chairman Gu and asked him to quickly find a solution.</p>

<p>Regarding the inspection of foreign ships, according to the person in charge of the Maritime Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, in the past, foreign ships entering the country often failed to obey Chinese laws and regulations for inspection. Later, personnel were sent to explain to various foreign shipping companies and provide guidance, and now more and more ships are obeying the regulations and coming to the bureau for inspection. The inspection procedures are exactly the same as those for domestic ships. After inspection, the bureau will issue a temporary or regular inspection certificate to each ship. After receiving the inspection certificate, each ship can enter the port and pass through.</p>

<p>Chen Taosheng (Taoxin), a technician of the Ministry of Industry and a technical commissioner of the Central Industrial Testing Institute, was dispatched to the United States in January last year to study sugar production and brewing. After arriving in the United States, he entered the Graduate School of Louisiana State University in the southern United States to study sugar production. In his spare time, he also practiced in the private laboratory of Dr. Owen, a brewing professor. The completed theses include "Microbial Research on Chinese Brewing Products" and "Fermentation Experiment of Cuban Molasses," which were published in famous American magazines. In November, after being awarded a master's degree in sugar production by Louisiana State University, he went to the Graduate School of the University of Wisconsin in the northern United States to study fermentation microbiology and fermentation chemistry. In mid-January of this year, he went to Chicago, Washington, and New York to visit government research institutions. In early February, he went to Europe from New York, stayed in Europe for a month, and visited more than 20 academic institutions and famous factories in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and the Netherlands. He visited almost all sugar production and brewing experts in Europe and the United States and brought back many works and publications. Yesterday, he arrived in Shanghai. He told visitors that China is oppressed by world science, which has led to the shrinking of its territory and the poverty of its people. From now on, if we want to consolidate national defense and develop industry, we must promote science. The Ministry of Industry is responsible for developing the national industry and should immediately concentrate national talents in the capital to imitate foreign goods and investigate domestic products in order to study established methods and detailed plans to show the people, and the results will be significant. As for the setting of tariffs, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry should earnestly consult to prevent domestic products from being hit by foreign goods. The Department of Agriculture and the Department of Commerce in the United States are called government offices, but they are actually the most complete research institutions. Our country should take this as a model. The scientific organization of the Ministry of Industry is an imminent task, and the industrial institutions in various provinces should also focus on researching local products and promoting local industries. Everyone should break the idea of being an official and do practical work, so that the country can have hope. It is said that before Mr. Chen went abroad,</p>

Despite only wearing a single layer of clothing after the long flight, she was covered in sweat. After Mr. Mérey and others expressed their welcome, Mr. Zhong Ziliang, our representative, also stepped forward with a bouquet of flowers to pay his respects. Immediately afterward, they went into the airport office, where the lady signed a type of arrival diary and filled out the inspection form of our Public Security Bureau.

<p>After the lady disembarked, she thanked the welcomers and then gave a brief speech to the Chinese and foreign reporters at the airport, saying, "I took off from Hong Kong at 6:30 this morning. Because I encountered strong winds and heavy fog along the way, it took eight hours and thirty minutes to reach Shanghai. I will not stay in Shanghai for long.

Unexpectedly, the Japanese reporters did not listen to the warnings of our soldiers protecting the airport and repeatedly secretly photographed the airport fortress. Our military officers, because they repeatedly warned them without success, recorded their names and detained the photos they had taken.

<p>The Fishery Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industries' Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region Fishery Construction Fee Collection Office issued a notice stating: "Regarding the issuance of a notice, we have received Order No. 1 from the Fishery Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industries' Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region, which states, 'We hereby appoint Committee Member Dai Yongtang concurrently as Director of the Fishery Construction Fee Collection Office, this order,' etc., and a seal is issued. Upon receiving this order, in addition to taking office and using the seal on a selected day and submitting separate letters, we should earnestly comply with the resolutions of the temporary meeting of the Fishery Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industries' Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region, which decided that the Fishery Construction Fee will be collected starting from April 15, and the rate of 1% will be temporarily collected based on 2%, etc." It is hereby announced to make it known. "It has been found that the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces are vast, and in order to avoid being beyond reach, the office has divided the area into ten districts according to regulations. In addition to the Songhu District, which is concurrently managed by the office and no separate branch will be established, nine branches have been designated, including the Ningzhen District, Ding Shen District, Ningxiang South District, Wentai District, Hangjiashao District, Hutaisu District, Chongtong District, Haizhou District, and Jingchang District. All fresh, salted, dried, and shellfish fishery products will be subject to a fishery construction fee of 1% of the value, starting from April 15. Merchants in various places are responsible for collecting the fee on behalf of the office according to the price. It should be known that this fishery construction fee has been approved by the Central Political Council and is purely based on the principle of taking it from fisheries and using it for fisheries. It is completely different in nature from fishery tax. At a time when fisheries are declining, improving fisheries is urgent. All fishery personnel should fulfill their obligation to pay a small fee and give the fisheries a huge construction, and should understand the government's intention to improve fisheries and earnestly comply with the requirements. If there is any deliberate delay or intention to evade, once discovered, they will be punished according to the regulations. The penalties are listed below. It is hereby announced to make it widely known. The penalties are as follows: Article 1. These penalties are formulated in accordance with Article 7 of the Provisional Regulations on the Collection of Fishery Construction Fees by the Fishery Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industries' Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region. Article 2. Anyone who transports fishery products with less reporting or evasion will be ordered to make up the construction fee and will be fined five to fifteen times the amount of the unreported fee. Article 3. Anyone who fails to comply with or refuses the inspection of the inspectors will be ordered to comply with the procedures, and after verification, will be fined 10 to 50 yuan. Article 4. Anyone who forges or alters fishery construction fee receipts will be punished in accordance with the law on forging valuable securities. Article 5. Any fishery personnel who violate more than two articles of these penalties will be punished separately in accordance with the provisions of each article. Article 6. The aforementioned fines shall be filled out by the punishing authority with the actual amount of the penalty on four-part penalty slips, which shall be issued separately and reported to the Ministry. The aforementioned four-part penalty slips shall be printed and issued by the Fishery Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industries' Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region, and the collection agency shall affix a seal. Article 7. Seventy percent of the aforementioned fines shall be confiscated, and thirty percent shall be awarded to the person who discovered and reported the violation. The confiscated funds shall be remitted by the collection agency to the Fishery Improvement Committee of the Ministry of Industries' Jiangsu and Zhejiang Region for safekeeping at the end of each month. Article 8. These penalties shall be implemented from the date of promulgation. April 8, 22nd year of the Republic of China, Director Dai Yongtang.</p>

<p>Foreign Rice and Wheat Flour Dumped Domestically</p>
<p>Requesting the Central Government to Impose Heavy Taxes</p>
<p>The Coarse Grain Industry Association submitted a document to the Municipal Party Department, the Bureau of Social Affairs, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, requesting that it be forwarded to the central government, stating, "Regarding the dumping of imported foreign rice and wheat flour, which harms our country's agricultural products, we request to impose heavy taxes to benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. We respectfully ask for your consideration. Our country is vast and rich in resources, and the food produced is sufficient to feed itself. There is no need for foreign goods. Unfortunately, after the disaster of war, we suffered widespread droughts and floods, and the people's food was occasionally panicked. As a result, foreign rice and wheat flour were imported in a continuous stream, and the outflow of money was countless. Fortunately, last year's harvest in the provinces along the Yangtze River made people happy that both farmers and merchants could recover. Unexpectedly, due to the world's overproduction, rice, wheat, and flour were shipped to our country, competing with each other and dumping at lower prices without limit, causing grain prices to plummet and farmers and merchants to suffer. Take rice as an example. The farmers' hard work all year round is not enough to offset the wages and rent taxes. The association's merchants transport goods from the place of origin to Shanghai, and all of them lose money. The rice from Hunan and Jiangxi to Shanghai relies on the purchase and transportation from Fujian Province to barely make a living, but the supply exceeds the demand and it is difficult to reverse the decline. As of now, the current value in this city is that the highest-grade machine-milled white rice from Hunan and Jiangxi is only 8 yuan, 2 or 3 jiao per stone. All external costs, such as麻袋 packing and transportation from the origin to Shanghai, require 2 yuan to 2 yuan and a half per stone. Based on this, the selling price at the place of origin is only about 6 yuan. Converting paddy rice into machine-milled white rice, the bran and grain are consumed by about half, so the farmer's income is only about 2 yuan, 4 or 5 jiao per stone of rice. The cheap grain hurts the farmers to the extreme. It has been found that the two Guangdong provinces are rice-deficient areas, with an annual shortage of about 10 million stone. In terms of relief, last year the five provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang had enough surplus rice to provide ample relief, but upon closer examination of the amount of rice purchased and sold in the two Guangdong provinces, only Wuhu had a small amount of transportation, and nineteen were seized by foreign rice. At present, the late rice in Shanghai has a thick accumulation, and the market price is as cheap as mentioned above, and the price of foreign rice is falling further, and there are frequent reports of secret orders. Alas, if this continues, the grain price will plummet, and it is impossible to predict the future. As for the domestic production of wheat, new wheat will be available in two months. Even if the flour mills need to order foreign wheat, they should limit the amount to two months' worth, but the reality is not the case. Various foreign wheat manufacturers in Australia, Canada, and Argentina, because of their low prices, are actively ordering from abroad on the one hand and aggressively selling futures in China on the other hand. In the future, when domestic new wheat is launched on the market, both farmers and merchants will be defeated, and there is no need to wait for tortoises to predict the future. In summary, it can be seen that the affairs of the national economy and the people's livelihood are greatly affected. The Shandong provincial government has already proposed a resolution to ban the import of foreign wheat flour, and we are requesting that the central government implement it. We feel the same way. In this time of foreign troubles and domestic worries, when the countryside is on the verge of bankruptcy and commercial transportation is in a desperate situation, if we do not impose heavy taxes on foreign rice and wheat flour and allow them to flood in, then our country will not perish from foreign troubles, but from the bankruptcy of the rural economy. The association's heart feels the danger and it is difficult to remain silent. Leaders of the Shanghai Municipal Council and the Bureau are concerned about the people's suffering and are always ahead of others. Therefore, we are submitting a special request, asking you to examine and forward it to the central government, ordering the Ministry of Finance to earnestly implement it to maintain agricultural production and alleviate the people's suffering. This would be greatly beneficial.</p>

Its original opening is as follows: Young students are the future masters of the country and society. To guide them well and not sow the seeds of moral decay and loss of shame, obscene novels and bad publications have been everywhere in recent years. Uninformed young children, once they read them, will leave a lasting and harmful impression, destroying the people and damaging the youth, which is a major problem for today's society. The enemy's strength is only a material loss, but the spiritual克伐 of these future masters is a fatal wound to the country and the village. The Association, in view of this, has launched a solicitation of moral education novels, appointed members, and raised funds, hoping to obtain good reading materials that meet the needs of the Chinese people. We hope that writers at home and abroad will not spare their treasures and contribute their writings generously. We will be grateful. (Guidelines) (1) Style: Use simple text or vernacular and new punctuation to write a long novel, or a collection of short stories can also be combined into one book. The total length should be at least 50,000 words or more. (2) Subject matter: With the spirit of Christianity as the central idea, and incorporating the old morality of our country and the new civilization of Europe and America, taking the strengths and discarding the weaknesses, both solemn and humorous, using lively and fluent language to describe interesting stories, so that readers can learn the benefits of morality in their leisure time. (3) Remuneration: After the manuscripts are collected, famous figures from the church will be invited to evaluate them and reward them with cash. A special prize of 200 yuan, a first prize of 100 yuan, a second prize of 50 yuan each for two people, and a third prize of 25 yuan each for four people. Other good works will be given book coupons at our discretion. Unselected manuscripts will be returned. (4) Deadline: The deadline for submissions is the end of September of this year. Submissions from outside the city will be based on the date of the postmark. Mailing address: No. 1703 Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai.</p>

<p>无关者二人先摘释</p>
<p>世界银行跑街绍兴人胡鹤年，家住汇山路四百九十三号门牌，本年二月廿四号深夜一时许，突被绑票多名侵入，将胡之二岁子国安绑去，并将值洋数十元之饰物刦去。经胡报告捕房，请为查缉。嗣经总稽查处华总探长陆连奎侦悉是案绑匪匿迹处所，乃督同探长刘绍奎、冯志铭、邵景范、探目周鸿林、孙德福等分别在东西华德路六百三十五号、辣斐德路同裕里八号、霞飞路月华坊二十三号、蒲石路四百零二号，先后拘获绑匪王为生、张颂尧、孙志明、朱忠更（又名更龙）、刘钦、俞季生、钱锡红、陈孚亮（陆军四十七师参议）、妇人余小妹、吴周氏、吴玉春、马阿凤等十二名口，抄获盒子炮一支、子弹二百零六粒。并据朱忠更之供词，在宁波县属马村将肉票救出，带回上海。讵未及一日，胡国安忽满身密布红点，形同天花，由其有属延北福建路痧痘儿科专家徐丽洲医生诊治，据诊断结果，谓系湿瘰。胡家以既属湿气，当无大碍，故处之泰然。乃不料至本月六日突然毙命。昨此案由第一特院刑庭长钱鸿业开庭绩讯，捕房律师钱恂九起称，本案先拘获王为生、张颂尧、孙志明、余小妹等，经王供出须拘捕朱忠更，方知肉票下落，捕房乃设法将朱及其余一干人拘获，抄得朱忠更之图章一枚，该图章即系原告所接勒赎信未署名之图章，经朱之供词，始将肉票在宁波救出，乃未及六日遽而病死，故今日不能到庭。遂将徐医生之药方及肉票之肖影呈案，而陈孚亮、钱锡红，因无证据，故不予起诉，应请先行摘释云云。钱庭长乃谕陈孚亮、钱锡红开释。继由刘绍奎探长投禀拘捕各被告及调查情形一过，并称在朱忠更处抄获奶粉瓶一只、起首图书一个，查该奶瓶系恐肉票尚须吃奶，故而购备，至起首图书上之地点，全属伪造，缘现今租借房屋，均须具保，该图章即用以租屋时盖于保单上用者，亦即呈案。经钱庭长核禀，当向各被告逐一质讯之下，谕令分别还押，改期再讯。</p>

<p>经理陈乾顺受重伤</p>
<p>案情离奇真相未明</p>
<p>昨晚九时四十五分，法租界菜市路口，发生枪杀案，真相未明。兹将调查所得，纪述于下。</p>
<h3 id="e166">汉口分设支号 <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>乾丰泰香烛号，开设法租界东新桥菜市路口第五十号至五十二号，已十有余年。店主为甬人陈庭椿，年四十九岁，妻陈氏，年四十二岁，膝下仅一子，名芝奎，现年二十八岁，娶二妻，均早逝，仅留一子，名毛头，年方五龄。所有店中一切事务，昔日均由陈庭椿管理，历年经营，颇有赢余。庭椿乃于前年往汉口另设丰顺，本人则在汉主持一切，所有沪号事务，另托同乡人陈乾顺为经理，其子芝奎，时常往来沪汉，专事批送货物等。</p>

<p>三日前，芝奎因汉口缺货，乃特乘轮来沪，向沪号取货，包裹妥当，即于昨晚八时许，雇乘人力车数辆，送往停泊在虹口江华轮上寄出，于九时三十分左右，仍乘原车回店，下车后，以颇觉乏力，即直入店旁私弄内进屋登楼安息。讵芝奎方拟进门时，弄内隐处突跃出暴徒二名，各持手枪，一见芝奎，即不问情由，各向其轰击一枪。芝奎受创后，亟反身出弄奔逃，时该号经理陈乾顺正在结算帐目，忽闻隔壁弄内突起枪声，甚为惊诧，以该弄系该号私有出入要道，因何来此枪声，乃亟亟奔出店堂探视。</p>
<h3 id="e168">两人一死一伤 <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>当陈乾顺奔至店门时，但见小老间芝奎，正向爱多亚路直奔，所穿灰色衬绒袍上，血渍斑斑，后面并无追赶者。陈知有意外，乃将其一把拖住，讯问根由，讵话声未绝，陈乾顺身旁枪声又起，身倒地，芝奎亦于斯时创痛加剧，踣倒于地。及附近岗捕闻警赶到，奈凶手已于人丛中逸去，乃亟报告捕房，赶派探捕到来，并用车将受伤二人，车送仁济医院，奈芝奎因受伤过重，竟当场身死，即转送辅元堂，候今晨报请法院检验。</p>
<p>[P捕房侦骑出&gt;</p>
<p>事后调查，得悉芝奎身中二枪，均在重要部位。陈乾顺年三十九岁，身部共中三枪，左肩一枪，子弹直穿而过，臀部中一枪，子弹由右小腹而出，右大腿一枪，伤势至重，恐有性命之忧。法捕房方面对于此案，甚为注意，当晚即侦骑四出，追寻线索，至于是否仇杀，成竟另有隐情，一时未能遽断，据四邻称述，陈氏父子在沪多年，向极和蔼，当不致积有怨仇云。下车，不准上车。松江至上海快车，由上松车站开出，上午第一次七时，第二次九时，第三次十一时，下午第四次一时，第五次三时，第六次五时。到沪乘客，经过卢神庙、竹竿汇、新东门、华阳桥、汇桥、马桥各站祇准上车，不准下车，其票价单程票，每张大洋八角，松沪来回票，每张大洋一元二角，以三日为有效期间。孩童长不满三英尺半者免费，在三英尺半以上者，照章购全票。行李代运，另订规程。</p>

<p>奚本人否认老妇为生母</p>
<p>老妇坐庭隅竟双泪交流</p>
<p>—两造律师在庭上微有争执—</p>
<p>年将六旬之妇人黄周氏，以已故富户奚鹤铭之子奚龙生，系伊所生，昔年伊生此子时，因已有两子，且家道贫寒，无力抚养，遂将此子由李瑞林经手，抱送与人，迄将三十载。初以不知着落，前岁始悉已为奚氏收养。但伊兹既年迈，应受生子赡养，乃往交涉，讵龙生竟不承认该妇为亲生之母，故延吴经熊律师，向第二特区地方法院对龙生提起遗弃之诉，旋经人调解，由龙生给该妇巨款，订立声明书，案遂了结。现黄周氏对于前订之声明书，以签字时并不知道其内容，伊与龙生之母子关系，自不受该声明书之拘束，是以又延律师三数人，具状第一特区地方法院，对奚龙生提起确定母子身份之诉，并将奚鹤铭之妻奚黄氏列为第二被告，业经该院杨鹏推事一再开庭传审。昨晨，又届续讯之期，原被两造及双方律师五人均到案，杨推事先传讯证人李瑞林，由李将昔年以原告所生之子抱送与奚家，暨去岁原告对奚龙生起诉后和解各情，详细陈述毕，原告律师尚欲请传证人黄宝和、吴经熊等到案质证，并以第二被告迄未遵传到庭，亦请补传到案，俾令其证明收养奚龙生之经过，庭上则认所请皆非必要，双方律师旋辩论至声明书一点，原告律师张舍我谓被告律师李祖虞、秦联奎，皆系该声明书中之证人，请求制止该两律师对于声明书部份之辩护权，张律师并称，“律师系雇佣性质，祇要给他钱，是无所不为的。”李秦两律师闻此语，大不满意，谓张律师出言侮辱全体律师人格，请书记官将其所言记录，杨推事当以张所请制止辩护权一点，于法无据，随即裁决不准，并仍命双方律师依法进行辩论，而被告律师终以原告起诉，于法律则无根据，于事实又无证明，要求驳斥，原告律师则以本案系伦理问题，不能以寻常法律之时效束缚之，各持理由，互辩良久，庭上嗣向原被两造询问最后之意见，据黄周氏称，当初李瑞林抱去时，祇言系送与赵家，直至四年之前，方由李说明系在奚家，故我一知此子下落，即要求赡养，务请庭上饬令被告认我为母，俾接续香烟等语。被告奚龙生供此妇实不是我之生母，先父祗云生我者为徐氏，今此妇无非敲诈云云，此时原告黄周氏坐于庭隅，双泪交流，厥状至为可悯，杨推事以本案业已审讯终结，遂谕候四月十八日宣判。</p>
<p>当局又有更进一步之对付办法，兹将昨日各项消息，探录于后。</p>
<p>另订规则　法公董局以此次征收界内各脚踏车行修理特捐，竟遭反对，即停供拒纳捐税各车行水电，以示惩戒，但此项压迫办法，非特不能使各车行屈服，反引起全体车行之团结一致，互相援助，全体停业，闻法当局除饬探捕分赴各车行催领照会费外，因均不愿捐纳，故连日已将停供水电各车行水电表一律拆卸，一面并另订出租车辆规则，凡出租车辆，均须填具法文单据，以便查考，据该业负责人表示，此项单据，除各汽车行已实行外，脚踏行因营业细微，向无此项规定，倘一经实行，则每车行均须雇用法文书记一人，故按月开支，必须更多一成，何能负担，且脚踏车行，何能与汽车行相提并论，决难承认。查汽车行之所以有此规定者，为防止不正当行为人之租车，以便查考，而脚踏车租，向无此等不正当行为，更属不必多此一举，故各同业除一并反对外，此事断难实行。</p>
<p>黨部傳詢　上海特别市党部民训科、于昨日下午·传唤脚踏车行贩制同业公会代表王涤生·王接通知、即偕同各代表前往面洽、由民训科特派朱亚揆接见、详询此次法公董局征收捐照费之过情形、允为据实转咨市政府、向法当局交涉、一面复劝各代表在交涉期内、应静候解决、切勿有越轨行动、各代表均唯唯而退。</p>

<p>Currently, it is the Western Spring Holiday, commonly known as the Foreign Qingming Festival. All Western officials in this city are on leave.

Therefore, during these four days, excluding Sunday's regular holiday, the court will only hear civil and criminal self-accusation cases in the morning and afternoon each day.</p>
<h3 id="e174">Petition from Residents of the Southern City to Add Patrol Posts <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, merchants and residents in the area of the Southern City Local Court, including Xu Weiji Hat Factory, submitted a petition to the Municipal Public Security Bureau stating, "Respectfully submitted, our area, the section of the Southern City Local Court, West Hu Minnan Zhelu, and Shears Bridge Road, has seen increasing prosperity and densely populated residences in recent years. However, no additional patrol posts have been added to date, leading to robberies and injuries during the day and thefts at night, which are frequently heard of. Recently, the shooting of a patrol officer near this area this month, traced back to its cause, is due to the insufficient number of patrol posts and the lack of timely response, resulting in this unexpected disaster. It has also made travelers uneasy and residents restless. However, the residents in our area bear the same tax obligations as other citizens and should receive the same level of protection. Therefore, we especially implore your esteemed office to promptly plan and add patrol posts in our area and implement them as soon as possible to enhance protection and maintain public safety. This would be a great benefit." This is submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau by Xu Weiji Hat Factory, Sanxing Company, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e175">Proposed Method for Emergency Treatment of Schistosomiasis in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>National Physician Tang Liupu wrote to this newspaper, "Having read the April 12th Shanghai Great Evening News, the spring weather in northern Jiangsu is extremely dry, and schistosomiasis has been discovered, spreading throughout Huaiyin, Huaian, Lianshui, Siyang, Muyang, Suqian, and other counties. The symptoms initially involve obstruction of the lower burner and difficulty breathing in the lungs. After three days, the abdomen gradually swells up like an overturned basin, becoming as hard as iron. After this stage, the patient becomes unable to speak and dies within a week at most. Those suffering from this disease are mostly men, with women being extremely rare." According to the classics, "The lower burner is like a ditch," and "The large intestine is the organ of conduction, from which changes arise." This indicates that there is too much dampness, qi, and blood. If people are affected by the dry heat of heaven and earth, bowel movements often become blocked and unsatisfying. After prolonged accumulation, impurities will inevitably overflow into the lower burner. The lungs and large intestine are internally and externally related. If the large intestine is blocked, breathing in the lungs will naturally be difficult. Heat in the qi phase will inevitably extend to the blood phase. Heat in the blood will lead to stasis, and after extreme stasis, worms will be generated. Women have menstrual periods every month to discharge these, so this type of symptom is extremely rare. In my opinion, this disease should be carefully examined through inspection, questioning, listening, and palpation. If the patient is physically strong or even withdrawn, speaks softly but forcefully, and is usually capable of hard work, then a modified Taoren Chengqi Decoction should be used to purge, with small doses of Mangxiao, Dahuang, Gancao, Taoren, Zhishi, Gualouren, Danpi, Laimiaozi, and Guiwei being tested. If this is ineffective, a large dose of Fangfeng Tongsheng Wan can be decocted and taken, treating both the exterior and interior. Even for those with spiritual afflictions, the urgent should be treated symptomatically. After purging, Wumei, Baihe, and Gancao soup can be used to regulate. The physique of northerners is generally stronger than that of southerners. In treating disease, it is only necessary to seek appropriate remedies, without seeking lofty theories. I wonder if this is appropriate, so I am specifically submitting it to various newspapers for publication, hoping to discuss it with knowledgeable physicians from various regions."</p>

<h3 id="e177">Sudden Attack with Three Stabs <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Xu Yonggui Suspects Wife of Being Seduced</p>
<p>Xue Aquan Wrongfully Stabbed</p>
<p>Huang Zigen, a 55-year-old man from Pudong, has been running the Jurulin Vegetarian Restaurant outside Xiaonanmen, Nancang Street. His wife, Zhu, is 56 years old. They have a son named Yinsheng, who married Lin, both of whom have passed away, leaving behind a daughter named Gendi, who is currently 16 years old. Two years ago, in the first month of the lunar year, she was betrothed to Xu Yonggui, son of Xu Shunrong, the owner of the Xutai Hing Bucket Shop on Huayi Street outside Dadongmen, through a matchmaker. Yonggui, also known as Boying, is 23 years old and originally from Chuansha. His father, Shunrong's Xutai Hing Bucket Shop, has a very prosperous business, so he has branches in Xiaonanmen and other places. Yonggui also assists with the store's business. After Gendi married into the family, they initially lived together in the old store on Huayi Street, and the relationship between husband and wife was still harmonious. However, since Gendi became dissatisfied with her father-in-law Shunrong's behavior last year, the couple moved to their old home in Jinjiaqiao, Chuansha, Pudong. Yonggui also stopped working at his store and was subsequently introduced to work at Jiang Shengtai Bucket Shop at No. 36, North Santai Lane, Laozha Bridge. At around 11:00 AM yesterday, Yonggui, carrying a sharp blade, rushed to the Jurulin Vegetarian Restaurant, grabbed his associate Xue Aquan, and asked if he was named Xue Aquan. Xue responded in the affirmative. Yonggui instantly raised his eyebrows, his face turned pale, and he shouted in a murderous tone, "Good!" He immediately raised his hand and slapped Xue in the face. Xue, after being struck, was confused and stood there dumbfounded. Yonggui then pulled out the concealed sharp blade from his side and stabbed Xue repeatedly. Xue raised his hands to resist. At that moment, the other associates in the restaurant were shocked and immediately rushed forward, holding Yonggui down and disarming him. However, Xue had already been stabbed three times, one on each arm and one in the left abdomen, about an inch wide. The internal organs were vaguely visible. If it had been any deeper, the intestines would have protruded. At the time, after Xue was wounded, blood flowed from the wounds, and he collapsed to the ground in extreme pain. Seeing this, the associates immediately reported Xu Yonggui to Xie Chuping, the guard at the 15th post, and took him to the Third Section of the First District. Meanwhile, Xue was taken to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. It is said that if there are no complications, his life will not be in danger. After the hospital doctors bandaged his wounds, he was sent to the Third Section of the First District. During the preliminary trial, Xu Yonggui confessed, "My wife, Gendi, often goes to her mother's house, which is the Jurulin Vegetarian Restaurant. I didn't mind. However, recently, Gendi's temperament has changed drastically, and after going to her mother's house, she must be urged repeatedly before she is willing to return home. I became suspicious and paid attention to her every move. Until the day before yesterday, I suddenly found a note in her jewelry box with the words 'Zhang Xingen of Deyilou in Shanghai City to be delivered to Zhang Bingnan.' I questioned Gendi repeatedly, and she claimed that Zhang Bingnan was one of the associates used by her mother's family and was introduced by Xue Aquan. As for whether or not a physical relationship had occurred, Gendi naturally refused to say so. However, I thought that Xue was seducing my wife and having affairs with others, and this note clearly showed that there must be a secret between Gendi and Bingnan. Therefore, I was greatly angered and could not contain my anger for a moment, so I carried a sharp blade and went to my wife's family today to fight Xue to the death." Xue Aquan confessed that he was 26 years old and from Wuxi. "Although Yonggui often came to the store, I never talked to him and never introduced his wife, Gendi, to Zhang Bingnan, who works in the store. So I really don't understand why Yonggui came today and stabbed me." As the testimonies of both parties differed, and the matter involved injury, a document was prepared and sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for interrogation at around 4:00 PM.</p>

<p>Investigation Reveals Embezzlement of a Considerable Amount of Funds</p>
<p>Each Sentenced to Three Months of Imprisonment</p>
<p>Zhao Zhongwei from Ningbo and Cao Xinren from Zhenjiang, deliverymen at the China Coal Briquette Company at No. 407 Caishi Street, Hongkou, became addicted to prostitution and gambling. Their income could not cover their expenses, making it impossible to cover up the embezzlement of over 700 yuan. Previously, managers Lu Hengtong and Ye Shunyu noticed the sudden change in the two men's appearance and their luxurious clothing. They thoroughly investigated the accounts handled by the two men, confirming that Zhao Zhongwei had embezzled 256.5 yuan and Cao Xinren had embezzled 459.5 yuan. They immediately reported the situation to the Hongkou Police Station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Zhao and Cao and send them to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday, Judge Wu Zehan summoned Chief Prosecutor Wang Zuzhe to court for a continued trial. Zhang Tianyin, the police station's lawyer, presented the previous events, stating that the defendants had admitted to using the funds in the police station and requested the court to conclude the case as soon as possible. The two managers, Lu and Ye, testified about the events, presenting the account books and pointing out the amount embezzled by the two defendants. They also hired a lawyer to request a civil lawsuit, demanding full repayment. When questioned, the two defendants admitted guilt and begged for leniency. Judge Wu sentenced Zhao Zhongwei and Cao Xinren to three months of imprisonment each as a warning. The number of days of detention before the judgment is confirmed will be calculated at two days to one day of imprisonment. Each must return the amount claimed by the plaintiff.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Yan Zhengbao Accused of Seducing a Widow, Abandoning Her After Starting a Relationship <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wang, a 35-year-old woman from Yangzhou residing at No. 96 Dunrang Lane, Rue Amiral Bayle, French Concession, whose husband, Hua Jianzhong, has passed away, has filed a lawsuit with the Second Special District Court, accusing Yan Zhengbao (51 years old), a fellow villager and owner of Tian Shunxing, a wooden rickshaw repair shop at No. 142 Route Hennequin, of seducing a widow and abandoning her after starting a relationship. She requests that the case be thoroughly investigated and prosecuted under Articles 344 and 363 of the Criminal Law, and she also requests incidental civil compensation for living expenses and damages. Her complaint states that after her husband's death, she relied on her own efforts to raise her son and daughter-in-law and to uphold her chastity. The defendant coveted her beauty, repeatedly teased and seduced her with sweet words and financial enticements, giving her clothing and food, causing her to fall into his trap. In the ninth month of the lunar calendar in the 20th year of the Republic (1931), she lived with the defendant and allowed him to have sexual relations with her. At that time, she brought gold and silver jewelry worth over 300 yuan and handed it over to the defendant. She also had a building at No. 13 Yufuli rented out by the defendant. The defendant gradually sold off the jewelry and spent the money. By June of last year, the defendant used trickery to have her move to Yuancheng Lane on Route Lafayette, giving her 15 yuan per month for expenses, but soon after, he abandoned her and ignored her. She requests an investigation and, incidentally, civil compensation for living expenses until she reaches 60 years old, totaling 4,500 yuan, and damages for property loss of 360 yuan. The court, based on the complaint, summoned the defendant. The defendant's lawyer, Wang Shi, presented a defense, stating that the defendant and the plaintiff are relatives by marriage, as the defendant's daughter is married to the plaintiff's son. After the relative Hua Jianzhong passed away, the plaintiff smoked opium and opened a "swallow den" to make a living. In the autumn of the 20th year of the Republic, because the plaintiff and her son were helpless, she begged Chen Yuanliang to ask the defendant for help. The defendant, considering that they were relatives, allowed the plaintiff and her son to stay at his home, and he also ordered her to quit smoking. However, the plaintiff was addicted and, after staying for more than a month, gradually returned to her old ways, secretly going out to smoke and not returning late at night. The defendant's persuasion was ineffective. By the spring of last year, the defendant urged the plaintiff to take her son back to their hometown, but she begged Chen Yuanliang to plead for her, and she and her son sought a house to live in separately. However, after moving out, she still came to borrow money from time to time. The defendant, unable to bear the annoyance, refused her. The plaintiff held a grudge and falsely accused him of seduction and fraud. He requests that witnesses be summoned and questioned to clarify the matter. The court originally scheduled the trial for yesterday afternoon. Both parties and their lawyers reported on time. However, because the presiding judge was on vacation, the hearing was postponed and re-summoned for further verification.</p>

<p>—Taking a Large Dose of Foul-Smelling Disinfectant, Life in Danger—</p>
<p>Mr. Ren, a native of Jiangyin residing at No. 67 Shoupin Lane, Ward Road, is nearly sixty years old. He used to be a coppersmith but has been unemployed for a long time, leading to poverty and destitution. The elderly man, facing such a situation, was extremely depressed and took a heavy dose of foul-smelling disinfectant at 9:00 PM last night. Shortly after, the neighbors noticed and rushed to report to the Fire Brigade, who arrived with an ambulance and transported him to Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. It is said that he took too much poison, and his life is in danger.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Chen Xiaoliu, a Victim of Economic Oppression, Commits Suicide by Drinking Hydrochloric Acid <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Chen Xiaoliu, a 35-year-old man from Changshu, residing in the back three rooms of the living room of Tang Pan, a sub-tenant at No. 1 Zhenghua Lane (south of the railway), Datong Road, Zhabei, used to make a living selling oil bean curd vermicelli. Recently, Chen, under economic pressure, applied for a loan of 20 yuan from the Poverty Alleviation Office on Minli Road, stating that the payment would be made on April 10th. Later, Chen asked a shoe store to guarantee the loan, and the Poverty Alleviation Office sent someone to investigate the guarantor. However, the store happened to be closed for three hours for the Qingming Festival, and the family had gone to sweep the tombs. When the investigator from the Poverty Alleviation Office arrived at the store, he saw that it had closed. Therefore, on the 10th, when Chen went to collect the money, he was refused. After Chen returned home, he was depressed. Yesterday morning, at around 8:00 AM, Chen took a black soy sauce bottle, not knowing where he bought hydrochloric acid, and returned home. The people in the house did not pay attention to it. A short while later, Chen screamed in pain on the bed. After inquiring, it was learned that he had drunk hydrochloric acid. He was immediately sent to Pushan Hospital for treatment. After the doctor used medication to wash out his stomach, the poison was expelled. However, according to the doctor, some of the poison had already spread into the lungs, so he was quickly sent to Baolong Hospital in the concession for treatment. Unexpectedly, when he was sent to Baolong Hospital, Chen was already dying. The doctor, seeing the situation, immediately gave him a strong heart injection. However, the treatment was ineffective, and he died at around 10:00 AM. The body has now been sent to the Hongkou Coroner's Office for examination. The deceased has a wife and a son, Wang, who is 27 years old, and a son named Jinlong, who is three years old. There are no other family members in their hometown.</p>

<p>(8) A Letter from Mr. Xu Xianfu from This Port: Can the Missionary-Style Education Method Save the Countryside?</p>
<p>To the Reporter and Mr. You Huaihao: Regarding the issue of returning to the countryside, Mr. You Huaihao, with his many years of research as a rural expert and practical experience as an agricultural practitioner, advises Mr. Xiongsheng to return to the countryside. However, this provokes a rebuttal from Mr. Liu. I do not want to discuss Mr. Liu's theory. However, regarding Mr. You's opinion (advising Mr. Xiongsheng to return to the countryside), if it is only for personal life, I think it can be said. As for using his own strength, there is a possibility of creating a new-style Peach Blossom Spring. I think there is room for discussion with Mr. You. This may be the opinion of a fool. I hope it is not considered showing off my slight skill before an expert. The state of the Chinese countryside is like this: among the 336 million farmers, 186 million are landless farmers, and 150 million are farmers with land. Among them, 50 million wealthy farmers occupy 79% of the agricultural land. This is enough to prove the differentiation of the class in Chinese rural areas. Among the landless farmers, there are tenants and hired farm hands. At the same time, we tried to investigate China's export commodities in the customs import and export trade statistics. Nineteen is the raw materials of agricultural products. It is said that Chinese rural production has largely become commodity production, that is, it has become the raw material production base of imperialism. Directly and indirectly, it is dominated by the international market. However, we should also pay attention to the fact that China is a country that has been economically invaded by imperialism. Under their economic domination, our urban capitalist industry has been developed, but it is largely in their hands. National industries, with weak capital accumulation, cannot compete with imperialism. Therefore, capitalists, merchants and usurers with a small number of currencies turned to rural investment. Among them, there is the formation of heavy-handed exploitation. At the same time, we should also pay attention to the fact that the feudal warlord system exists in China. They are in a superior position, in order to satisfy their private desires, in order to obtain their financial resources, and in order to cultivate their power, they used exorbitant taxes and levies to oppress the countryside. The direct impact is on the landlords and owner-farmers. The landlords again exploit the tenants. Self-cultivating farmers and tenants exploit the hired farmhands. Seeing that there is such a complex situation in the Chinese countryside, can it be like Mr. You's ideal? Can the missionary-style educational methods save the countryside and save the peasants, and create a new peach blossom source? I hope that Mr. You will not hesitate to teach me on this point. But I want to declare that I am not opposed to saving the countryside and returning to the countryside. It's just not that simple.</p>

<h3 id="e192">The Tragic Case at the Zhongshan Forest Farm <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>All Students Send a Telegram Seeking Aid</p>
<p>Students Remaining in Shanghai Express Indignation</p>
<p>(Hong Kong, 14th) The National Zhongshan University's All-Student Conference for Aiding the Forest Farm Tragedy telegraphs: "To the Shenbao Newspaper Office, for public review by all schools and academic and cultural organizations nationwide: Our school, unfortunately, suddenly experienced an unprecedented tragedy on the 8th of this month. Dean Zou Jiucheng, leveraging the lascivious power of the school president's relatives, indulged police chief Zou Libing to arbitrarily detain professors and brutally assault staff. The authorities, shielding evildoers and acting improperly, allowed the thugs to remain at large. All faculty and students are extremely indignant. The General Assembly has unanimously resolved to strike and seek a just resolution. We hereby announce the details of the tragedy to the nation: The forest police captain of our school, Zou Libing, is the school president's nephew. Because he concurrently served as the captain of President Wu's guard, he entrusted Zhang to act as the forest police. After Zhang assumed office, he privately dismissed five forest police officers. Professor and Forest Farm Director Hou Guo, believing the forest police were innocent, urged Zhang to reinstate them. Zhang, failing to fulfill his personal desires, reported to Zou Libing, who then gathered more than ten members of the school president's guard and went directly to the forest farm. They pointed pistols at Director Hou and forest farm staff members Huang and Lai, threatening them. They then detained Director Hou in the president's office, falsely accusing Huang and Lai of being communists and brutally assaulting them, causing serious injuries. They also used iron chains and large locks to secure them in the school police office. Dean Zou Jiucheng deliberately indulged the evildoers and fostered wickedness. Only after faculty and students signed and submitted a petition did they release the two to seek medical treatment. Later, President Zou not only failed to redress the grievances of these three but also falsely accused the students who upheld justice of being lawless, still protecting the perpetrator and refusing to bring him to justice. Since the incident, the entire school has been under the gunpoint of the president's guard, with no way to appeal. How can we not feel heartbroken? The entire student body, forced to do so, painfully agreed to strike, hoping that the authorities will realize their past mistakes, redress the grievances of the injured, seek guarantees for over four thousand faculty and students, protect the dignity of the sacred institution of learning, and seek the extension of human rights. Therefore, we painfully make this sacrifice and respectfully request that national cultural organizations uphold justice, show sympathy and provide assistance. We are earnestly looking forward to it. The National Zhongshan University's All-Student Conference for Aiding the Forest Farm Tragedy kowtows."</p>
<p>The Zhongshan University Students Remaining in Shanghai held a meeting on the 12th and sent a telegram to the Guangdong Zhongda Farm Tragedy Support Association, stating: "Zou Lu indulges his nephew in beating and detaining faculty and staff, trampling on education. It is truly outrageous. We deeply hope that everyone will rise up together to remove this Qingfu (a symbol of evil), not be intimidated by threats, not be tempted by bribes, not lower one's own standing, not bend one's will, and fight to the end. Our association pledges to be your backing. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Education for strict investigation, we send this telegram to express our condolences and wish you the best in your efforts. The Zhongda Students Remaining in Shanghai kowtows."</p>

<p>Student Representatives from Private Schools Have Been Organized</p>
<p>The principals of thirteen private middle schools in Nanjing City previously requested changes to the entrance exam. Although the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau has now announced the entrance exam measures, the scoring and passing standards (setting 60 points as passing), the question design methods (failing to include more test questions), the lack of consideration for regular grades (regular grades have no points), and the level of subjects tested exceed what ordinary students usually learn. The principals, believing their requests were not met, no longer intervened. Students from each school initiated the organization of a delegation. On the 10th, ten students from each school, totaling one hundred and three students from the senior and junior high school levels of the private schools that have been registered, held a meeting and decided to elect one student from each senior and junior high school, totaling twenty-six students, to form an executive committee. On the 12th, the executive committee held a meeting, elected three standing executive members and other executive members for each department, drafted the articles of association and a petition stating the reasons for requesting changes to the entrance exam, and a declaration. Regarding the entrance exam measures, they do not dare to be unique and hope to follow the measures established by the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai Municipal Education Bureaus.) It was decided to hold a meeting on the 17th to petition the Ministry of Education and the Beijing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. This newspaper reports.</p>

<p>Yesterday a Letter Was Sent to the China Aviation Association</p>
<p>Requesting That Donations from the Education Sector Be Used to Purchase the Aircraft</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Association, in order to actively promote the "Shanghai School No. 1" aircraft, has decided on methods through a representative assembly of various schools. Yesterday, a letter was sent to the China Aviation Association, which reads: "Dear Sirs, Since our association has been actively promoting the idea of saving the country through aviation, we have convened a representative meeting of major primary and secondary schools in this city, and it has been decided to raise donations from the education sector of the entire city to purchase the "Shanghai School No. 1" military aircraft. Significant progress has been made. Recently, your association solicited aviation members and appointed team leaders, many of whom are principals of major primary and secondary schools. At the same time, the Education Bureau also instructed the principals to solicit members and purchase aircraft for your association. At a time when the national crisis is imminent and saving the country cannot be delayed, our association should lead the education sector of the entire city to work harder, so that the "Shanghai School No. 1" aircraft can meet all the people of Shanghai in the near future. However, the amount of donations already raised is still far from the amount needed to purchase the aircraft. We now plan to discuss with your association the possibility of transferring the donations raised by various educational organizations and team leaders in this city to purchase the "Shanghai School No. 1" aircraft as soon as possible, so that we can see its completion soon. We have always admired your association's patriotic enthusiasm and believe that you will deeply sympathize with our cause. We hereby send this letter to you, hoping that you will consider it and reply soon. We will be very grateful."</p>

<p>The Board of Directors of the Hongying Education Foundation held its second meeting on the afternoon of the day before yesterday (the 13th) at the Ye residence on Avenue Joffre.

<h3 id="e198">Ministry of Education to Restrict Studying Abroad <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>—Study Subjects Will Primarily Focus on Science, Medicine, Engineering, and Agriculture—</p>
<p>Must Be Graduates of Domestic Technical Colleges or Higher and Pass an Examination</p>
<p>According to the Regulations for Study Abroad Certificates previously stipulated by our country, anyone who graduated from a secondary school in the country was qualified to apply to the Ministry of Education for a study abroad certificate and go abroad to study at their own expense. Later, because middle schools were divided into junior and senior levels, the current Regulations for Study Abroad Certificates stipulate that senior high school graduates have the right to obtain a study abroad certificate. The Ministry of Education has recently seen that many self-funded students spend huge sums of money to study abroad and only learn some superficial common knowledge from foreign countries. After returning to the country, they are of no benefit to the social economy, which is contrary to the original purpose of studying abroad. If this continues, it will seriously affect the economic capacity of the people. Therefore, there has long been a proposal to revise the Regulations for Study Abroad Certificates. Yesterday (the 13th) afternoon, the Ministry of Education held a ministry affairs meeting, which was attended by all section chiefs and above. It was heard that the main points for revising the Regulations for Study Abroad Certificates have been decided as follows: (1) Study subjects will primarily focus on science, medicine, engineering, and agriculture; (2) Must graduate from a domestic technical college or higher and serve for three years before being able to take the examination for government-funded students; (3) Self-funded students must graduate from a domestic technical college or higher and pass an examination before being issued a study abroad certificate; (4) For the convenience of self-funded students taking the examination, self-funded study abroad examinations will be held in major cities every year, and similar examinations may also be held in inland provinces and cities; (5) Government-funded students who pass the examination in each province and city must pass a re-examination by the Ministry of Education before being issued a government-funded study abroad certificate. Although the above points have been decided, they still need to be revised in detail in terms of the regulations at the ministry affairs meeting on the 14th before being officially announced on a set date.</p>
<p>praises Mr. Ye for donating this huge sum of money to develop education, expressing great admiration. Next, he commends Mr. Ye for focusing on developing education by not running a university but running a library and rural primary schools, not pursuing empty fame but valuing practicality, which is particularly admirable. He then elaborates on the urgent need for libraries and rural primary schools in this city, hoping that those who hear of Mr. Ye's example will follow suit and make great contributions to the future of the country and the nation. Next, the three members of the drafting committee for the detailed rules and documents, Shen Xinqing, Wei Wenhan, and Xu Qiufan, reported on (1) the rules of procedure for the Board of Directors, (2) the rules of procedure for the Standing Committee of Directors, and (3) the rules of procedure for the Custodial Committee. Mr. Wei explained the process item by item, discussed it carefully, and as a result, made some revisions and passed them one by one. Next, the drafters read the documents to be submitted to the Ministry of Education and the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau for filing, which were discussed and passed. The donors and directors then signed the articles of association on the spot, and the meeting adjourned.</p>

<p>Bravely Set Off in the Rain Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Seventeen People Started Off With High Spirits</p>
<p>Chen Xuzhou Arrived in Minhang First</p>
<p>The unprecedented feat organized by the Baihong Athletics Team, the 216-kilometer long-distance Shanghai-Hangzhou race, started yesterday morning after a heavy rain under the Ying Shi Memorial Tower in Old West Gate. There were originally eighteen participants, but Zhou Wangqian was absent due to temporary foot swelling, and Kuang Shihuai withdrew halfway through the Shanghai-Minhang section. Therefore, only seventeen people started, and one less will be able to complete the first day. Minhang was halfway through yesterday's first day's journey, totaling more than 29,000 meters. Chen Xuzhou was the first to reach the Min Du Wharf. The second was Jin Zhongkang, and the time was calculated to be two hours and twenty minutes. After crossing the river, they still had to advance to Caojing. The first day ended there. The results obtained yesterday were limited to Minhang. The reporters were limited by time and could only follow and report this section. It is estimated that they will arrive in Caojing around 3:00 PM.</p>

<p>The night before last was a torrential downpour, and the weather was not favorable. The rain only stopped a few minutes before the race. Although the rain had stopped temporarily, there was still a lot of rain. At 8:30, the roll call started. Zhou Wangqian was absent, for a total of seventeen people. The spirit of struggle was not slightly diminished due to the weather. What was difficult was the slippery road, and with Shen Siliang's command, they mobilized together and began to advance on the long journey of more than 400 li.</p>

<p>The motorcycle of the Municipal Public Security Bureau opened the way in front, and seventeen athletes followed, advancing along the road. They passed through Zhonghua Road, entered Huangjiaque Road, Chezhan Road, and went south on Xietu Road, which is the beginning of the Shanghai-Minhang long-distance bus route. Mud splashed everywhere, and it was difficult to walk. Only then did they enter the Qingliang Avenue, and everyone advanced together as a group, slightly divided before and after. He Dafu and Chai Huanjin were in the front, Jin Zhongkang and Bai Zilong were next, and Xu Yan, Li Yagu, Zhou Ruquan, Lin Quanbo, Huang Sheng, Bai Yibi, and Chen Yuzhou were behind. The last were Zhu Shengyuan and Meng Guangyi.</p>

<p>When Xietu Road ended, they crossed the railway of the Jilu Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, and the asphalt road of Caoxi Road was flat and comfortable. That was the Kangzhuang Avenue, and Shanghai City also went out of bounds at the same time, and people entered the territory of Shanghai County, officially entering the Shanghai-Hangzhou highway. All the way, the rape flowers were yellow and the peach blossoms were red, and the scenery was boundless. At this point, seventeen athletes gradually separated, because it was related to the record. The first three came in a line, namely Li Yagu, Wu Shuying, and Chai Huanjin. Fifty meters behind, there were Jin Zhongkang, Chen Zhou, and Xu Yanbo. They had already accelerated and passed forward.</p>

<p>At 10:50 AM, the first person, Chen Xuzhou, completed the 50+ li and arrived at the ferry terminal of Minhang Pubin. Jin Zhongkang was only five or six meters away. When they arrived at the pier, they were still full of energy and had no fatigue. Three-fifths of the first day's journey was gone. Chen and Jin Zhongkang crossed the river at the same time and continued to advance to Caojing. It took Chen a total of two hours and twenty minutes from Ximen to Minhang. Four minutes after Chen, Bao Yibi arrived, and after another three minutes, Huang Shengbai arrived. Bao and Huang crossed the river together, and the others were about five or six minutes apart. The order is as follows: Li Yagu, Zhou Ruquan, Xu Yanbo, Chai Huanjin, Lin Quanbo, Wu Shuying, Bai Zilong, He Dafu, Wu Xun, and Xie Guolue. As for Zhu Shengyuan and Meng Guangyi, they were still resting halfway. The reporter watched the athletes cross the river and then returned to Shanghai by car, looking at the other side, they were still fighting. Today, they will depart from Caojing, pass through Jinshanwei, Quingongting Town and Zha Pu, and reach Haiyan.</p>

<h3 id="e219">The Movement of Loudspeakers <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— VT</p>
<p>Many people have a regret: that their radios do not produce a loud enough sound to use a loudspeaker. The question of how to use a loudspeaker is a common problem. The common-sense answer to this problem is that a loudspeaker needs adequate power to operate. This is like needing a lot of force to move a large stone; if a weak child tries to move a heavy stone, they will inevitably fail. Naturally, the operating power of a loudspeaker also has certain requirements.</p>
<p>The loudspeakers currently in use are of two types: electromagnetic (Magnetic Speaker) and electrodynamic (Dynamic Speaker). Electromagnetic speakers are further divided into horn-shaped (Horn) and cone-shaped (Cone) types. Horn loudspeakers require approximately 5-50mw of power, while electrodynamic loudspeakers require 250-1250mw. To provide this ample power, an appropriate vacuum tube must be selected for the final stage of amplification. Furthermore, to obtain this necessary power, appropriate low-frequency amplification is also necessary.</p>
<p>For a load power of 700mw and a load resistance of 4000 ohms, since the maximum undistorted voltage obtainable from a typical grid-leak detection method is only 0.3 volts, the required voltage amplification factor for low-frequency amplification can be calculated as follows:</p>
<p>P = 700mw</p>
<p>R = 4000</p>
<p>El = PR = 700 x 4000</p>
<p>= 53V</p>
<p>El is the required voltage across the load. However, in practice, the output is greatest when the load resistance is twice the internal resistance of the vacuum tube. Therefore, the total resistance, i.e., the sum of the load resistance and the internal resistance of the vacuum tube, is R + R = 2 = 3-2R. Therefore, the total voltage required for the vacuum tube plate circuit is:</p>
<p>E = 53V x 3-2 = 79V</p>
<p>However, the maximum input voltage for grid-leak detection is 0.3, so the required amplification factor is:</p>
<p>A = 79 - 0.3 = 260</p>
<p>This means that for the maximum output of grid-leak detection, an amplification factor of around 300 is needed for the loudspeaker to operate fully. However, the voltage in the grid circuit is usually not high, and to avoid sound distortion, the input power to the grid is often restricted, resulting in an amplification factor of over one thousand.</p>

<p>3.  Sound volume fluctuates or cuts in and out intermittently.</p>
<p>This problem is even more annoying than the previous two. It would be better not to hear anything at all. With faint sound, you can at least hear something. But with this problem, the sound is suddenly very loud and clear, then suddenly very faint and muffled, or completely silent. It's extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>The causes and solutions for this problem are listed in the table below:</p>
<p>Phenomenon  Cause  Solution</p>
<p>Periodic weakening of sound (Fading)  Inevitable for non-high-end radios</p>
<p>Sound changes constantly  Poor antenna installation  Carefully inspect and repair</p>
<p>Sound cuts in and out intermittently  Faulty grid leak  Replace with a good one</p>

<h3 id="e221">Simple Method for Measuring Resistance <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang</p>
<p>When problems occur with AC radios, simply measuring the resistance of each circuit to see if the values are accurate can quickly identify the source of the problem.</p>
<p>This is the latest method for testing radios in Europe and America, so it is clear that measuring resistance is a very important task. Ordinary resistance measurement requires a multimeter, but multimeters are very expensive, making it difficult for many radio enthusiasts to acquire one. Therefore, the method introduced in this article uses parts commonly available to radio hobbyists: headphones, batteries, resistors, and potentiometers. First, divide the potentiometer into equal divisions, then connect the components as shown in the diagram below. H is the headphone, P is the potentiometer, B is the battery, R is the standard resistor (value is known), and X is the resistance to be measured. After connecting the circuit, briefly connect and disconnect the headphone circuit at point K. When the circuit is briefly connected and disconnected at K, a "click" sound will be heard in the headphones. Then, turn the potentiometer knob until no sound is heard in the headphones when K is connected and disconnected. At this point, the value of R1 is the reading from point O to point A, and the value of R2 is the reading from point O to point D. Using the formula, X can be easily calculated.</p>
<p>Example: If R is known to be 1000 ohms, and no sound is heard in the headphones when R1 is 10 and R2 is 90, then X equals 9000 ohms.</p>
<p>To understand the principle behind this method, simply review the principle of the Wheatstone bridge.</p>

<h3 id="e222">Various Types of Antennas (Continued) <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Yunqiao</p>
<p>(2) Loop Antenna: Loop antennas are extremely easy to install and provide good results (as shown in Figure 5). A regular antenna wire about 50 meters long can be used, wound into a loop with a diameter of half a foot. Insulators should separate the two ends, and a rope should be threaded through the middle, as shown by the dotted line in the diagram. Hang it indoors, connect the lead-in wire, and you can receive radio broadcasts. When not in use, it can be taken down and folded, making it very convenient.</p>
<p>In addition, single-wire and multi-wire antennas for outdoor use can also be moved indoors. Iron bed frames can sometimes be used to receive radio broadcasts. For example, a 20-meter-long No. 18 insulated wire can be stretched tightly around the perimeter of a room, one foot away from the walls, yielding good results. In general, while indoor antennas are easier to install than outdoor antennas, they will not produce satisfactory results unless the radio has a sufficient high-frequency amplification stage. Therefore, a simple antenna requires a complex radio. Single-tube radios can use indoor antennas if they are very close to the broadcasting station.</p>
<p>Other Points to Note</p>
<p>The higher the antenna, the better for crystal radios and single-tube radios. However, the higher the antenna, the more static electricity it will pick up from the atmosphere. This is not noticeable for small radios, but if you use a radio with powerful high-frequency amplification, the static electricity will be amplified along with the signal, resulting in a lot of noise. In this case, indoor antennas may produce a clearer sound. Furthermore, sensitive radios can receive radio broadcasts even without an antenna or ground wire. However, they may not be able to receive distant stations as well. Do not sacrifice performance for unnecessary convenience; ensure your radio can perform to its full potential.</p>
<p>The direction of the antenna lead-in wire connection should ideally face the broadcasting station. For example, to receive broadcasts from Hangzhou in Shanghai, connect to the southern end of the antenna; to receive broadcasts from Beijing and Tianjin, connect to the northern end. Therefore, if you find that your radio should be able to receive a particular station but is not performing as expected, try switching the antenna lead-in wire connection.</p>

<h3 id="e225">Correction <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>In the first article of the previous issue, "About Power Supplies," C1C2 in the illustration was mistakenly written as C12. C2 is the capacitor in the middle of the annotation. Also, there were errors in the filtering section of the second diagram in the second article during the drafting and plate-making process. The connection method can be corrected according to the right side of the first article's illustration.</p>
<p>Common Sense</p>
<p>(6) Electrical Quantity</p>
<p>As mentioned above, current and voltage are directly proportional, and resistance is inversely proportional. However, we must also pay attention to one thing: electrical quantity. If we have a wooden bucket that can hold one hundred gallons of water, and it flows out at a rate of one gallon per minute, then the water will flow for one hundred minutes until it is empty. But if the bucket holds less than one gallon of water, then we will definitely not be able to get one gallon of water flowing. The principle is very clear. Therefore, when talking about current, we must first understand electrical quantity. If the source of electricity is very small, then even if we increase the voltage and reduce the resistance, we will not be able to obtain a strong current. When we say a current of one ampere, we mean that one unit of electrical quantity can pass through any part of the conductor every second. This unit of electrical quantity is called the coulomb (see Units of Electricity), which is 6.29 x 10^18 electrons or the number of charges. If a current of one ampere flows continuously for one hour, then the total electrical quantity is called the ampere-hour, which is 3,600 coulombs.</p>
<p>(7) Electricity</p>
<p>Water flows from a high place to a low place, and its force can be used to do various kinds of work (such as turning wheels). The magnitude of the water force depends on the water pressure and the amount of water flow. The same is true for electric current. When electric current flows, it can be used to light lamps, drive vehicles, and perform other kinds of work. This electrical power is also called electrical power, and it also depends on the voltage and current. The unit of electrical power is the watt. Its relationship with voltage and current is as follows: Electrical power is often represented by the letter P.</p>
<p>Electrical Power (Watts) = Voltage (Volts) x Current (Amperes) i.e., P = E x I</p>
<p>But since E = IR, P = E x I = I^2R</p>
<p>The capacity of a vacuum tube is also expressed as the product of the plate voltage and the plate current. For example, UX203A has a plate voltage of 1000 volts and a plate current of 125 MA, so its power is 1000 x 0.125 = 125 watts. But this is the power we input (Input). After using it to generate oscillating current, because there are many losses, the output (Output) power is at most only 50 watts. Therefore, 203A is a 50-watt vacuum tube.</p>
<p>The power of radio stations is also expressed in watts. The power of the central broadcasting station is 75 kilowatts (Kilowatt), which is 75,000 watts. The power of each radio station in Shanghai is mostly below 500 watts.</p>

<h3 id="e226">On the Bell-Ringing Youths <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>To scold people straightforwardly and frankly, one must be a person with special privileges. In the past, there were bell-ringing elders, specially appointed by imperial grace, who wore yellow robes and carried boards, strolling idly in rural villages or market towns every day. As long as they encountered disobedient local children, they could rely on the Emperor's power to beat and scold you at will, or even drag you to the nearest yamen to sentence you to death. Now that the dynasty has changed, a new batch of bell-ringing youths specially appointed by imperial grace have been born in response to the times. They have picked up their pens and started to play this game.</p>
<p>Bell-ringing youths are naturally much stronger than bell-ringing elders. The elders wore those yellow linen coats with the four words "Specially Appointed by Imperial Grace" written on them, but the youths certainly disdain to wear them. Maybe they would even wear a set of modern western clothes like rebellious children. This way, firstly, they can avoid the suspicion of being loyal dogs to the master, and pretend to be upright heroes like Wu Song. They can fart in the imperial palace and urinate on people's heads. But if rebellious children of the village pinch their noses when they see them, they will forget their own stench and loudly scold you for being sneaky, downright vulgar, and daring not to show your nose to compare with them.</p>
<p>They can also stand in the position of a third party, hinting to the master how to deal with rebels, saying, "So-and-so, so-and-so, wasn't he done like that? Why don't you follow in his footsteps?" They will even borrow the signboard of uprightness and openly report the news, saying: "So-and-so is an alias of So-and-so, living in such-and-such place." I remember there is a section in the Zuo Zhuan called "Jian Shu Cries for the General." Duke Mu of Qin did not listen to Jian Shu's advice and sent troops. Because Jian Shu's son was also in the team, he cried and sent him off, saying: "The Jin people will meet the army at Xiao, and there are two mausoleums there. The southern mausoleum is the tomb of Xiahou Emperor, and the northern mausoleum is where King Wen avoided the wind and rain. You will surely die in this place, and I will collect your bones there." At that time, the teacher who taught us this passage said: "Jian Shu is really powerful. In his crying, he told his son the geography and strategy. This article is really written so euphemistically!" I think that modern bell-ringing youths all have the skills of Jian Shu.</p>

<p>— Fu Yiye</p>
<p>Mr. Rudin, whom Turgenev used to represent the Russian youth of the 1840s, we must encounter many of them in today's Chinese society! For example, in a magnificent Salon or dining room, cafe, or any elegant gathering, there must be a group of young people who are good at talking, full of wisdom and enthusiasm. There, they freely express their opinions in a heated and exaggerated manner. Their excited, flushed eyes look at people like two small fireballs, and their smiling mouths constantly vibrate, opening and making loud noises, winning the sympathy and praise of those present. Sometimes, they stand up straight, raising their fists, like soldiers who are about to charge to the front line, bravely and resolutely carrying out their great ideals with the spirit of Puritan sacrifice, and passionately mobilizing the surrounding audience. Their heroic spirit is so worthy of love and respect! They observe society very clearly, they know how to destroy and how to build, they are rich in scientific and philosophical knowledge, and they also love painting, music, and literature. They will tell you how unique Goethe and Shakespeare's styles are, and how wonderful Dante's Divine Comedy is. If they accidentally walk to the piano, they will also play a section of Beethoven's famous music... In short, they are young people with multifaceted talents and full of enthusiasm. Their demeanor, clothing, voice, and smile have moved the hearts of many young people. Lively and delicate girls and young and affectionate young women are all passionately loving them, always wanting to get close to them, be led by them, and realize those lofty and far-reaching ideals...</p>
<p>Who knows, when these young people we admire return to their rooms in the middle of the night, intoxicated by incense, they suddenly become different people!</p>
<p>They think about how lovely the girl they approached during the day was; they think about how to seduce her, pull her into their arms, they know how to enjoy themselves. "Love is art." "Life without love is not worth living." These are some of the words that he is later quite qualified to say at some tea parties or seminars with an arrogant expression. Finally, he calculates how to make money, how to invite celebrities to dinner, such as vice ministers or even ministers and deans, and collude to form some societies, talk about love and beauty, publish some nonsensical and cheesy words, and praise each other to become famous. He hates that his name is not immediately as Goethe's flying around the world... After putting a half-burnt cigar into the spittoon, he falls asleep on the bed. No one knows what wonderful dreams he is pursuing at this time, but the grand words and high theories he passionately expressed during the day have long been forgotten.</p>
<p>Saying that he forgot may not be correct. Look, the next day he is still in a crowded place, his face flushed, his mouth grinning, wildly waving his fists, and tirelessly, excitedly and generously talking nonsense, isn't he?</p>
<p>Ah! Mr. Rudin of nineteenth-century Russia, when did he take the train from Siberia to China!</p>

<p>— Zhang Mingchun</p>
<p>One autumn afternoon, Wang Erchi stood in front of his door, and suddenly had the idea of going to Shanghai.</p>
<p>He stood in front of the door, as if gazing at something, as if indulging in something.</p>
<p>Although it wasn't raining, the sky was always gloomy, the west wind was blowing bleakly, a few crows were cawing, looking south, Wang Er saw a panoramic view of Luo Village, saw the white belly of a stagnant water embracing the village, like a dead snake lying there, he also saw the small bridge on the river, the bridge piers were already crooked, the railings were also scattered, and the dilapidated earthen walls of the village, all of which were abandoned thatched houses of people who had left their tenants to go to Jiangnan. Further away, apart from a few landlord's blue-tiled houses, there were only some tall and short chimneys, silently facing the sky, without any smoke.</p>
<p>He was very strange, the village had not suffered a ruthless fire, nor had it suffered a cruel war, why would it be so desolate and frightening, the sound of the ding-dong gong of the snack seller a few years ago could not be heard, the melodious tin whistle sound that tempted the children was gone, today, he only heard a monotonous, hoarse, crow cawing annoyingly on the bare branches, in the small lanes and big lanes, only the autumn wind carried dust and fallen leaves running, a few mangy dogs, thin and bony, slept in the corners of the thatched houses, the children in the village were also as thin as the dogs, in short, the scene was full of desolation.</p>
<p>He stood in front of the door, as if gazing at something, as if indulging in something.</p>
<p>The hazy night was gradually approaching, the air was full of bats coming and going, the stubborn Wang Er, who was in his thirties, had never understood what was called melancholy, and today, countless sour tears welled up in his desolate heart unconsciously.</p>
<p>He thought of his more than twenty years of tenant farmer life, year after year, in frugality, endurance, hunger, and hardship, he fell into poverty inextricably. Who would want to leave their hometown, but the hometown has become a fasting prison; go to Shanghai, but how many people who have been there have had a good time?</p>

<p>(18) Tang Caichang's Party Membership</p>
<p>Before discussing Tang Caichang's party membership, we must know that the party membership of Huang Ai and Pang Renquan is still in dispute. In fact, Huang and Pang were engaged in the labor movement, only knowing to serve the workers, only knowing that there was the Hunan Labor Association, and there was no so-called party affiliation. Simply because Huang and Pang were the first people to sacrifice for the Chinese labor liberation movement, all factions competed to be their ancestral tablets, and the party membership of these two people became a problem. Just as Tang Caichang was the first among the late Qing patriots to raise troops to overthrow the Manchus and die, both the Reform Party and the Revolutionary Party wanted to privately claim him as a light of their party. Zhang Taiyan briefly stated in his article "The Morality of Revolution" that in the Reform movement of the Gengzi year, Kang Youwei said that the matter belonged to Tang Caichang. Caichang was not accustomed to foreign affairs, and Long Zehou, a disciple of Youwei, showed him the way. Later, Caichang's power became increasingly strong, and he did not let Zehou know about anything. He also frequented prostitutes and banquets. Zehou became angry and fought for it but could not get it. Then, he led Wen Tingshi to Wuhan to reveal his affairs. After Caichang died, his military supplies were in Shanghai, and his colleagues stole them and fled. Therefore, the change of the Gengzi year was caused by the immorality of the Gengzi party members. Not long after, at the New Year celebration of the Minbao, a Mr. Liu came out to speak, defending Tang Caichang. He briefly stated that Caichang's uprising relied on secret societies, and the purpose of the secret societies was "to destroy the Manchus." This one sentence was enough to prove that Tang Caichang was not a member of the Reform Party. Those who communicated with Kang and Liang did so for a reason. At that time, revolutionary patriots often mistakenly regarded Kang and Liang as comrades, and Tang Caichang was not the only one. After Caichang died, Kang and Liang used him to gain a reputation for serving the king and to fool party members. His flesh was not worth eating, and his words were not worth arguing. However, Mr. Zhang Taiyan was a leader in academia and a pioneer of the revolution, and his words were respected by the people of the country, and he also said this, so Tang Caichang died with injustice. Later, Zhang Taiyan wrote a portrait of Tang Caichang, and he regretted that his revolution had not succeeded. The praise said: "The dreamy heaven, the vast Emperor, abandoned my divine state, and favored the Hu descendants. The yellow crane cries at night, annihilating this bright beauty. The head of Wenchang, the red eyes still see. (Self-note, Caichang was beheaded at Wenchang Gate after his death. It is also said that Caichang's eyes were red.) See me unharmed, write this phantom." At this time, Mr. Zhang had regarded Tang Caichang as a revolutionary comrade, and no longer belittled him as a member of the Reform Party.</p>

<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Scold me for being cowardly, and I cannot defend myself. But what if I weren't cowardly? Why make such a pointless sacrifice!"</p>
<p>But afterwards, he thought again, if everyone were like him, would the Chinese nation never have a day of liberation? Thinking also of those comrades who had been arrested, he felt infinite sadness, and almost burst into tears.</p>
<p>"Indeed, within Chinese territory, the imperialists and their running dogs can be so unbridled; they must at least be given a warning. This is the true meaning of the demonstration just now!"</p>
<p>He also remembered once seeing a small Chinese merchant walking past a Japanese primary school when several little Japanese brats picked up small stones and hit the merchant on the head. The Japanese police saw it but just smiled and tacitly approved of the little brats' actions. Although the Chinese merchant was angry in his heart, he dared not vent it; he could only endure it, walking past with a fawning smile to show his magnanimity. He also saw that the Japanese police on North Sichuan Road were even more arrogant than the white police in making unnecessary checks on Chinese people, arbitrarily insulting passersby. Therefore, a revolutionary crowd taking action to warn the imperialists was exactly what was needed.</p>
<p>Thinking it over and over, in the end, Haiquan could not help but admit to himself that he was a cowardly youth, utterly unqualified to be a revolutionary.</p>
<p>"But what about those leading figures in literary circles? Aren't they even worse than me? And they have the nerve to call themselves Marxists, to claim to be believers in the materialist conception of history."</p>
<p>Thirty-four</p>
<p>Haiquan walked towards the school, taking a detour, and saw that they were not paying much attention to today's demonstration. Only when he was coming out did he hear a classmate at the school gate criticizing:</p>
<p>"XXX, always making such a fuss, what's the result?"</p>
<p>After hearing this, Haiquan's heart rebelled again. He felt that this classmate was simply a cold-blooded animal; not only did he not show sympathy for those youths who were so enthusiastically participating in the revolutionary movement, but he turned around and made sarcastic remarks. It was simply outrageous!</p>
<p>But after reflecting on it, he felt that he was suffering from a huge contradiction. Not only a contradiction, but seemingly a mental imbalance. He often harbored revulsion towards the dictatorial attitude and secretive behavior of Tang Yaoxing and his group, and sometimes even wanted to explode, scolding them for deceiving the youth and trapping them in prison. As a result, he concluded that they were incapable of achieving revolutionary success. But when he heard those youths poisoned by the imperial examination system making irresponsible comments about the actions of the revolutionary youths, he would again feel indignant, taking up the cudgels on their behalf, and scolding them for being out of touch.</p>
<p>When Haiquan felt this huge contradiction, he experienced a truly indescribable mental anguish.</p>
<p>When he returned to Cao Shiguang's house, it was dusk. He stepped onto the stairs, unable to hear a sound. He looked up and saw only the dimness of the entire building. He went up, pushed open Qiuying's door, and saw that Qiuying was still lying sprawled on the bed as usual, breastfeeding the child.</p>
<p>As soon as Haiquan saw her, he felt as if he had found solace, forgetting all about the events of this afternoon, and his head stopped aching. He boldly walked to the side of the bed and sat down on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>"Has Lao Cao not come back?"</p>
<p>"He hasn't come back all day."</p>
<p>Her spirit seemed very anxious, displaying an impatient expression.</p>
<p>"Why don't you turn on the light?"</p>
<p>"The switch is broken."</p>
<p>"Then ask the landlord on the second floor to fix it."</p>
<p>"Shameless! He wouldn't care about us upstairs!"</p>

<h3 id="e231">Tobacco <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The saying of the ancients, "In matters of taste, mouths have the same preferences," only referred to food and drink; since the advent of tobacco, besides food and drink, we must add smoking.</p>
<p>In the seventeenth century, tobacco was introduced from Luzon to Fujian Province during the reign of Emperor Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty. Soldiers on the frontier suffered from cold ailments, which could not be cured without it. However, it was very expensive; it was said that one catty of tobacco could be exchanged for a horse, and those who transported tobacco out of the pass could lead horses into the pass. Therefore, the cultivation of tobacco gradually flourished. In the mid-Chongzhen period, an order was issued prohibiting the cultivation of tobacco, with violators subject to penal servitude; however, the profits were high and the penalties were light, so how could the harm of tobacco be eradicated? Later, the penalty was increased to death; but after the strict prohibition, soldiers suffering from cold ailments often went untreated. Helplessly, they had to lift the ban and allow the people to plant it. By the end of Chongzhen's reign, even three-foot-tall children were smoking, which was the earliest era of widespread smoking in China. 丨丨 "Note 1"</p>
<p>As for the popularity of cigarettes in China, it has only been about thirty years. It is said that foreigners invented cigarettes in 1832 through Egyptian soldiers. At that time, a large group of camels carrying tobacco was passing through Africa and was intercepted by soldiers. They did not have pipes at the time, so they devised a method of rolling up paper strips and smoking it. Later, everyone followed suit, and the popularity of cigarettes spread throughout the world.</p>
<p>Famous people in the world who enjoyed smoking cigarettes include Napoleon, Bismarck, and King Edward VII of England. There are countless famous Chinese people who enjoy smoking tobacco today. During the reign of Emperor Kangxi of the Qing Dynasty, Han, the top scholar from Suzhou, always had a wine cup and a tobacco pipe in his hand. Wang Yuyang, referring to the two items of wine and tobacco, used a sentence from the Analects to ask: "If you must part with one, which of the two should come first?" Han Gong pondered for a moment and said: "Wine." It can be seen that he loved tobacco more than wine. 丨丨 "Note 2"</p>
<p>The only thing I want to do after a meal is to smoke urgently, as people commonly say: "A pipe of tobacco after a meal is better than being a living god." When I was smoking cigarettes, I would put down my rice bowl and want to become a living god, and if I was even a little late, it felt as if my tongue was growing hair. Since I quit cigarettes due to illness, at first, it seemed inconvenient; but now it has been five years, and after putting down my rice bowl, I absolutely do not think about smoking, which is called: "Not smoking after a meal is also being a living god."</p>

<p>— Xia Tianwu</p>
<p>The salute dedicated to the warriors is the only true affection in the world.</p>
<p>The spirits of children are worn away in playthings, the spirits of women are worn away in adornments, the spirits of officials are worn away in flattery, and the spirits of merchants are worn away in abacuses and money. Only the spirits of warriors are sacrificed to the public, worn away in the trenches of gunfire and bullets.</p>
<p>The only stimulant for warriors is the rumbling of cannons.</p>
<p>Japanese people can kill Chinese people because we can also kill them. Chinese people must not kill Chinese people. The killer is Chinese, and the killed is also Chinese.</p>
<p>A mother's compassionate heart is concerned about the news of the warriors.</p>
<p>Ah! Only a few drops of red blood are left on the battlefield!</p>
<p>This is the greatest tragedy in the world!</p>
<p>The only true tears in the world are those that flow from the eyes of heroic warriors, mourning that great things cannot be done.</p>
<p>Those who are known in the world are not heroes; heroes all sleep in the desolate graves of unnamed warriors.</p>
<h3 id="e233">Night <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Xiaoting</p>
<p>Night is dark, it is dull, it is a space rich in anesthesia. In this space that is spurned by people, the cells it organizes have no living force at all. The cold and lonely phenomenon is the same as a dead soul, yet it has no awareness or spirituality to speak of!</p>
<p>But the prosperous city is not like this. The modern young men and women generally prefer to pick up this spurned space, wearing away their will and anesthetizing their spirits.</p>
<p>The brightly lit cafes, the dance halls where men and women embrace, and the bustling streets, the meat markets, these places are built from the cold cellar of night into a layer of hot and luminous illusory realms! Fly-like humans, propping up their dazed heads, unconsciously, like flies drawn to the stench, compete in those places. At this time, they are indeed like moths that like to stir in the bright atmosphere. The night of the city is a sharp weapon for anesthetizing people's spirits. Its temporary illusion cannot exist forever. After a certain period of time, it is still cold, dark, and there is not a bit of light to be found.</p>
<p>Chinese people are accustomed to living the life of the night, accustomed to anesthetizing their own spirits. Night is their only pastime. But since September 18th and January 28th, the violent Japanese have come to our country and fired several awakening cannons. The countrymen who were indulging in the atmosphere of night have gradually awakened to this day.</p>
<p>Indeed, the light built on the cold cellar of night is temporary, it is illusory, it is too narrow to hold many people. We who are immersed in its embrace will never find true light. We must save the fresh and active vigor, and we must jump over the environmental of the night in order to reach the open road of true light!</p>

<p>— Xia Ying</p>
<p>Spring leaps at the tips of the willow branches. My heart is also pulled by something unknown. I ran to the West Lake with a heart full of sorrow. Seeing that everyone else was so happy. This time last year, the Shanghai war was raging, and there were often solar airplanes soaring over the West Lake, but this year the front line is far away from us.</p>
<p>The lakeside hotels were all full, and I managed to stay in a friend's room. The sound of "stockings" landing on the corridor outside the door pierced deep into my sorrowful heart!</p>
<p>The seven-day spring holiday passed in the blink of an eye. What did I get? Look!</p>
<p>On the first day, a black and white checkered scarf was wrapped around the neck.</p>
<p>On the second day, slender white hands held stockings. On the third day, men's suit pants were revealed under a long cheongsam. On the fourth day, fluffy hair, rosy cheeks, a floral tie, and a beige men's suit. On the fifth day, a long cheongsam, a short suit jacket, a wide-brimmed soft straw hat used by farmers in the fields, and a string of Buddhist beads hanging on the front of the garment. On the sixth day, a bicycle knocked down a child on the road, and sweat dripped down. What about the seventh day? Riding a horse and galloping on the lakeside. Gone, everything is gone.</p>
<p>Intoxicated in the embrace of the god of spring! The West Lake changes color. The rivers and mountains also change color!</p>
<h3 id="e235">Hotel <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Metropolises are filled with travelers, so metropolises are also filled with hotels (?)</p>
<p>In Shanghai, the large hotels along Xizang Road and Nanjing Road meander as spectacularly as the Great Wall. Whenever dusk falls, many people head towards that Great Wall.</p>
<p>Hotels seem to be set up for travelers in name, but in fact, travelers who stay in hotels account for the fewest. The reason is that some travelers, considering the high cost of hotels, would rather stay overnight at their relatives' or friends' homes, while the idle young masters of the local general class leave their own luxurious houses and go to hotels to open rooms. It is said that hotels are not only fully equipped and well-serviced, but also unconstrained and free to move around! (The so-called free activities, of course, include smoking, drinking, whoring, and gambling.)</p>
<p>Every Saturday night, or on holidays, hotels are usually declared full. If a new hotel opens, the crowding of patrons is beyond description!</p>
<p>I think: "The flourishing of the hotel business is one of the reasons for the bankruptcy of the countryside."</p>

<p>Guizhi blushed and said, "Second Master, please don't misunderstand my meaning. To be frank..." Ji Zhi said, "Frankly what?" Guizhi said with a straight face, "Although we are very familiar, Second Master knows that we are girls from old families, and we don't understand those modern things at all." Ji Zhi saw that she had only eaten half of her bowl of lotus root starch and then stopped, so he said, "The lotus root starch is probably not very tasty. Shall I make you a bowl of tea soup?" Guizhi shook her head and said, "You don't have to be so polite. I can't eat anything." Ji Zhi took a packet of sesame candy from the plate, unwrapped it, and handed it to her, smiling: "Eat a little. I know that old maids are not sincere. Although they blame me in their mouths, they don't really blame me." Guizhi smiled with a red face and said in a low voice, "Don't fill me with rice soup!" Ji Zhi smiled and said, "Old maid, you said just now that you don't understand modern things, but the phrase 'filling me with rice soup' is very civilized. You only say it when you are willing." Guizhi smiled again with her head down. Ji Zhi said, "Okay, let's not talk about these nonsense. What else do you want to eat?" Guizhi said, "I don't want to eat anything. My mother doesn't know that I came out. I have to go back." Saying that, she loosened her scarf and was about to wrap it around her neck. Ji Zhi also stood up. Guizhi smiled and said, "You can sit for a while. Let me take the first step alone." Ji Zhi nodded and said, "I know that. I still have one thing to say, that is, ever since we met a year ago..." Guizhi smiled: "You don't have to say it, I understand everything." After saying that, she lifted the curtain and left in a hurry. She went straight home, and Jiang asked, "Running home in such a hurry, where did you come from?" Guizhi said, "The wind is blowing outside again. What else can I do but run?" Jiang said, "You still went out when the wind was blowing?" Guizhi said, "I thought of getting some honey from Old Chen's house, but Old Chen wasn't home, so I came back empty-handed." Jiang said, "Speaking of honey, I remembered something. The New Year is coming soon. Why hasn't Old Chen delivered our secret supply yet? I pay him every month, not a penny short." (42)</p>
<h3 id="e237">Shanghai Night Talk <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Ruogu</p>
<p>Polish Composers</p>
<p>This week, two musicians came to Shanghai. One is Frjmel, the composer of the operetta "Rose Marie"; the other is Tansmano, a modern young Polish composer.</p>
<p>The poet Shao Xunmei invited me to Summer Pike to watch Ms. Aluncion Granados perform Spanish dance one night. During the break, I saw an old man with a not very tall stature, a big nose, and a wrinkled face, wearing a snow-white vest and a straight black evening dress. The poet Shao told me that it was Frjmel. This time, he was traveling through Shanghai to collect information about Chinese folk music.</p>
<p>A few days later, the poet Shao called me, saying that he was hosting a Polish musician at the Xinghualou and wanted me to accompany him. When I arrived at the banquet, the poet Shao enthusiastically introduced me to shake hands with the young composer Tansmano, and we casually said a few words. I asked about the recent situation of the former Polish Prime Minister and world-renowned pianist Paderewski, and learned that the Polish senior musician had been on a musical performance tour in the Americas since leaving his political career.</p>
<p>Tansmano has a considerable position in the modern Polish music scene. Although he is not as well-known as Paderewski in the world of music, I have not heard his works, so I dare not make reckless criticisms.</p>
<p>This time he came to Shanghai, he felt the loneliness of an artist, because he was very popular in the music scene of Japan. He stayed in Shanghai for several days, unexpectedly received a cold reception, especially the conductor of the Shanghai Municipal Council Orchestra, Meiboqi, who was in charge of the music scene in Shanghai, did not express anything to him, and he seemed to be a little embarrassed.</p>
<p>From Tansmano's conversation, we can know his musical tendencies, sometimes dreaming of Ravel, sometimes dreaming of Stravinskyo</p>
<p>Ravel is a famous modern French composer. His style is very much influenced by his compatriot Debussy. Some people say that he is the successor of the French Impressionist musicians. His works are rich in pure musical colors.</p>
<p>Stravinsky is a unique writer in the modern Russian opera world. His works are completely innovative and full of oriental colors. He often likes to boldly use dissonant harmonies in his music and can achieve great success. He has a famous song called "Volga Boatmen's Song" (that is, the boatmen's song in the film "Party Soul"), which has a melancholy and sad flavor.</p>
<p>Tansmano has a special musical intuition, which is slightly different from the traditional Polish music tradition. The Polish music tradition can be represented by Chopin, the giant of the 19th century romantic music.</p>
<p>Chopin is a pianist and poet, and can also be called the soul of the piano. His style is completely lyrical, full of poetic interest, and he is a female composer and pianist. Tansmano's compositions are entirely based on national music, and he does not often rely on folk songs, but he will rediscover the essence of folk music, and his representative is called "Polish Music Score."</p>
<p>On this night, the poet Shao accompanied Tansmano to World College on Fooking Road to visit the ancient music performance of the Datong Music Society. Among those present were Li Shizeng, Xie Shoukang, and the female poet Fang Weide. In a music hall that could accommodate about 100 people, there were only a few dozen people listening to the Chinese ancient chamber music concert.</p>
<p>On the stage, the first was a solo guqin performance, High Mountains and Flowing Water, the sound of the qin was so light that it was almost inaudible. Then came a pipa solo, Wild Geese Descending on the Sandbank, and finally it seemed to be a song Bright Moon over the River, after the performance, I asked Tansmano for his thoughts on the concert.</p>
<p>He said: "This is the first time I've heard Chinese music, and it seems even more modern than jazz."</p>
<p>When I told him that it was the last remaining ancient music in China, he looked a little surprised, and at the same time, a seemingly disbelieving expression appeared on his face.</p>

<p>Cash Export Permit Issued for the First Time</p>
<p>New York, April 13 (Electric). Today, spot silver rose to 625, and forward silver also seemed to rise. The transaction was 4,775,000 ounces. The market situation was due to the Washington Conference and the revival of the theory of commodity inflation, so speculators made strong purchases, which led to this high price.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance received a report from Huan Street that it had issued a cash export permit to a New York general bank for the purpose of Dutch exchange. The cash will be loaded onto the Sdan Teng ship tomorrow, but the amount is unknown. This is the first cash export for exchange purposes since the gold export ban last month.</p>

<p>Bombay, India, April 13 (Electric). The Mauvinqi Company's silver market report stated that at the beginning of last week, speculators were active due to news of the silver issue at the Washington Conference, but later the market calmed down due to profit-taking, and speculative interest gradually faded. The average daily use of silver in the mainland was 20 bars, the same as last week. It is now expected that 6,000 bars of silver will be added to storage for delivery on the 15th. Last week, silver worth 10,000 pounds was shipped from London, and no silver was carried on the mail ship en route.</p>
<p>London, England, April 13 (Electric). The Mogataigos and Smith report on the silver market last week stated that apart from American purchases, no strength has been seen, but it is difficult to maintain success without American participation in order to expand the demand for silver.</p>

<p>Guangbang (Guangdong Banks) Heavily Sells Off</p>
<p>Falling One Yuan to Fifty Cents</p>
<p>Yesterday, the public bond market of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange fluctuated greatly. There were many rumors on the market, and the Guangdong banks sold off very strongly. The reason for the sharp decline had nothing to do with the war in the Northeast, but was actually due to domestic political problems, which were too complicated. At the opening in the morning, No. 54 continued to be sold off, and No. 40 was also sold off strongly. There were few buyers, and the market price uniformly fell by 30 to 40 cents. In the second session, the bulls of No. 38 came out, and continued to fall by 40 to 50 cents. The situation was bad, and people were panicked, which made people more suspicious. Fortunately, Nos. 16, 17, 27 and the North Banks all made purchases, and the decline was not too severe. At the opening in the afternoon, the Guangdong banks still sold off, and the above-mentioned varieties continued to fall by about 50 cents. After entering, there was a slight compensation for temporary short positions starting from 20. The seller has stopped, the enemy is not weak in the purchase, and the market price is slightly doubled to about 20-30 in order to compensate for the drop, after the entry it is still oversupply, re-fatigue appearance, a slight decline of one or two.

The total stock market volume reached 1.66 million shares. All European exchanges were closed from Good Friday to Easter Monday. Concerns about inflation in Wall Street and Washington are substantial. Speculators fear unexpected developments during this period, leading to a sell-off of gold dollars in the foreign exchange market, causing a significant drop in the U.S. dollar and a sharp rise in commodity and stock prices. Additionally, the announced 60-day and 90-day loan interest rate is 1%. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price　　Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks　　62.69　　Up 2.43</p>

<p>The yarn market is weak, with a fierce downturn primarily due to stagnant sales of spot yarn. There is no sign of activity from any quarter, and there is widespread anxiety among holders of large positions. With the end of the month approaching, those delivering yarn have ample supplies. However, some are still buying to speculate upwards. Overall, inventories are too high, domestic consumption is sluggish, and the market cannot sustain itself.</p>
<h3 id="e247">Yarn Price Drops by 2.4 Yuan This Month <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>The pre-market opening at Renbiao saw a slight increase of 0.3 to 0.4 yuan across all months due to rising U.S. cotton prices. However, after the 2nd or 3rd trade, news of stagnant spot yarn sales caused a sudden change in market sentiment, leading to a downward trend. Prices fell by 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 yuan across all months. The afternoon saw a significant shift in market sentiment due to a lack of buyers and stalled sales to customers, causing panic among large holders. Prices fell by 1.6, 1.7 yuan to 2 yuan across all months. Total trading volume for the day was 53,200 bales. Sales included 900 bales of Dafu, 1,450 bales of Chunji, 1,000 bales of Dafeng, 1,000 bales of Xinchang, 1,050 bales of Renfeng, and 2,800 bales of Changfeng. Purchases included 1,000 bales of Jifeng, 1,100 bales of Tongfu, 2,050 bales of Suilong, 2,950 bales of Yichang, and 900 bales of Xiesheng. Closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>The clearance of spot yarn is quite sluggish. Total purchases by various groups for the day are estimated to be only 265 bales, with prices falling by 0.5 yuan. Purchases by each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Anqing　5　North Group　10　Luzhou　10　Inland　42</p>
<p>Ningbo　5　Guangdong　95　Wuhu　33　Dealers　65</p>
<p>The cotton market was firm in the morning, following the trend of imported cotton, with buyers holding tight. However, in the afternoon, with the yarn market in a dire situation, factories were only covering their needs for raw materials and not actively seeking them. Furthermore, a certain factory's purchase of 5,000 dan of Tianjin coarse cotton from the previous month, which was unsuitable for spinning, was resold, causing a sudden drop in the market. However, four brokers held over 100,000 dan purchased previously, refusing to release it, which was pure speculation. In short, with the yarn market depressed, raw materials cannot remain expensive.</p>

<p>The pre-market opening at Zheng Biao saw some buyers in the market due to rising imported cotton prices, with all months rising by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. However, in the afternoon, cotton purchased by a yarn factory for the current month was deemed unsuitable and resold, causing a sharp drop in the market, with prices falling by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan across all months. Total trading volume for the day was 53,700 dan. Sales included 5,500 dan of Xincheng, 2,000 dan of Yuanxingchang, 2,100 dan of Yichang, 1,000 dan of Dafu, 1,000 dan of Tonghe, 1,300 dan of Xinheng, and 1,500 dan of Ruiyuan.

<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton rose sharply due to active buying and reactive purchasing. Wall Street was strong, and the market was firm and active. Futures rose by 17 to 20 points, and spot prices rose by 15 points. British cotton futures rose by 6-7 points, and spot prices rose by 2 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 4 points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to the slight fall in U.S. cotton and selling by Japanese traders and long position closures. However, it recovered due to buying by speculators. Pingguoer fell by 0.05 rupees, Oumula remained unchanged, and Bailuoxi fell by 0.25 rupees. Original telegram records are on the left (dated the 13th):</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, nearly 30 shipments arrived, and business in urban and rural shops was somewhat active, resulting in good market conditions. Sutong and Nangang rice varieties increased by 0.1 yuan, while Nangang rice remained stable. Only 600-700 shi of rice were sold due to limited demand. Fortunately, the supply was not large, and prices remained at previous levels. Duyangjian rice was stable. Yinyuan rice remained popular, with high prices, while Bianyuan rice was nowhere to be found in the market.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) About 20 ships arrived from various areas along the river. Although there was overcast and rainy weather in the morning, retail sales of Baijing rice were still decent. The market price of higher-quality rice remained firm, while mid-range rice was close to the prevailing rate. Early-season rice also sold well, with stable prices. Xian rice and Yinyuan rice remained stable.</p>

<p>--Fujian Merchants Continue Trading--</p>
<p>Yesterday, Hakka Xian and Minhua rice remained active, but local merchants did not engage in trading. The appetite of Fujian merchants was not as strong as last month. However, as the supply has been cut off recently and there is a lack of goods in transit, merchants are unwilling to transport rice to Shanghai due to unprofitable market prices. It is unlikely that any rice will be shipped to Shanghai in the near future. Suppliers remain firm in their positions. Therefore, the market was able to temporarily stabilize yesterday. 1,050 bags of late-season Jiangxi machine-milled rice were sold at prices ranging from 7.9 to 8.1 yuan, with mid-range rice sold at prices ranging from 7.57 to 7.68 yuan. In addition, 163 bags of early-season machine-milled rice were sold at prices ranging from 6.79 to 6.8 yuan, and 137 bags of mixed early-season rice were sold at 7 yuan. It is said that these were purchased by Fujian merchants. Local merchants only traded 200 bags of Saigon rice at 8 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, after the market opened in the morning and afternoon, the flour market showed a consistent steady and slight uptrend. The quoted price of imported wheat increased by approximately 0.235 yuan, which boosted market confidence. Although actual sales of flour for the current month were average, factory inventories were not particularly high, with only small factories having relatively large inventories. The market was steady and hovering. In the forward months, the market was buoyed by strong buying from outside speculators, with approximately 150,000 bags traded, causing the market to gradually rise. It is reported that Fuxin slightly reduced its holdings, and Datong followed suit. Market sentiment remains positive. The future direction of the market will depend on international developments. As a result, the price for the current month increased by 0.75%, the price for May increased by 1.25%, the price for June increased by 2.25%, and the price for July increased by 2.89%, and the price for September increased by 1.5%.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market showed a consistent steady trend. The quoted price of imported wheat increased by 0.235 yuan, which boosted market sentiment. There were offers for spot imported wheat recently, but there was no activity, and no orders were received. Although current inventory levels are high, some traders are unwilling to sell their holdings, so supply remains limited. With the delivery date for the current month approaching, outside parties are covering their positions. Buying activity exceeded selling activity in the forward months, which improved market sentiment. As a result, the price for the current month increased by 0.4 yuan, and the price for July and August increased by 0.4 yuan. There were no other comparable changes.</p>

<p>The sales of raw peanuts are weak, and demand from Guangdong merchants is sluggish. Suppliers are forced to lower prices to liquidate their holdings due to the daily loosening of production prices. The market shows no signs of development. Yesterday, Guangdong merchants purchased over 500 bags of Zhengcheng peanuts at prices ranging from 8.1 to 8 yuan. The sesame seed market, which was once active with trading by foreign firms, has become quiet recently. It is only being supported by a small number of local merchants and export traders, which has led to a gradual decline in the market. Yesterday, local merchant Chengjin Zhang traded 60 bags of Bailing sesame seeds at a price of 10.03 yuan. Business Sutras (20)</p>
<h3 id="e259">Pickled Mustard Tuber is About to be Available <a href="#e259" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c259" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">259</a></h3>
<p>Pickled mustard tuber is a famous product of Sichuan and is produced in large quantities. It has a wide range of uses and can be added to both meat and vegetarian dishes. It is sold in markets all year round. The new crop can be harvested a few days before Grain Rain, and it can be sold in various regions by the end of April. Here is a brief overview:</p>
<p>Pickled mustard tuber is made from the stems of the vegetable "mustard greens." It has a slightly salty and fresh taste. To preserve it for a long time and to facilitate long-distance transportation, it is often mixed with chili powder, which gives it a spicy taste. However, it still retains its fresh taste, and its color becomes bright red, making it visually appealing. It is packaged in ceramic jars, sealed tightly, and placed in bamboo baskets. Each jar has a net weight of 40-50 catties. The varieties and grades are as follows: (1) Lozicai from Yubei (Ba County) is the highest quality. It has a bright yellow color, and the pieces are of moderate and uniform size. It is fleshy and round, with a fresh and slightly spicy taste that does not change over time. (2) Fulingcai from Fuling is the next best. The pieces are of uneven size and may have some skin fragments. The color is also uneven, and the flesh is thinner, with a spicy and slightly fresh taste. With proper storage, it can remain unchanged. (3) Fengducai from Fengdu has a bright color and fleshy flesh, but the taste is inferior and it does not last long. It usually changes within one or two months, with the color turning from yellow to wilted and the taste becoming sour, losing all its advantages. Cunning merchants add a lot of chili powder to make it very spicy, masking the true taste. Therefore, the identification of pickled mustard tuber lies in its bright yellow color, round and fleshy pieces, and fresh and slightly spicy taste. This is the highest quality. Lacking one or two of these qualities indicates an inferior product.</p>

<p>The tea market in this port for foreign firms has become increasingly sluggish recently. European firms have not received any feedback from the telegrams sent out last week and remain unusually quiet. Yesterday, only Qiahe Foreign Firm purchased a total of 52 boxes of Luzhuang and Tuzhuang Zhenmei tea. Jinlong Foreign Firm recently finalized a deal for 370 boxes of Wuyuan Zhenmei tea at a price of 103 yuan. The market price is extremely low. Based on current market conditions, there is a clear trend of falling prices with no signs of recovery.</p>

<h3 id="e264">General Tang Honored as Army Commander <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>— Tianfang</p>
<p>Although China has a population as numerous as "carp crossing the river," the talent pool is always limited to a few individuals. A review of the political history of the past 20 years of the Republic of China reveals that the same 18 Arhats repeatedly take office, step down, and then take office again, creating a seemingly lively but ultimately unchanged situation. Is "talent scarcity" not the case?</p>
<p>Because of the scarcity of talent, there are inevitably cases of unconventional promotion and reluctant acceptance. For example, Tang Yulin, who presented Jehol, is known to all as a notorious person who harmed the country! Since the loss of Jehol, calls for his arrest and punishment have spread throughout the country. However, rumors may not be entirely true, so the central government sent personnel to investigate thoroughly. It is likely that "no evidence was found." Perhaps "there are no great generals to resist Japan," so "a fleeing general is made a vanguard." Although the arrest warrant has not been rescinded, the position of army commander has been effectively bestowed.</p>
<p>From losing territory to investigation, from investigation to reappointing as army commander, this is a very clever approach. Although General Tang's fortune is somewhat unfavorable, his official star has not fallen. Losing the "chairmanship" (because there is no chair to preside over) and gaining the "army commander" is not entirely without consolation. Compared to the young Marshal Zhang who was blocked from going abroad, he is much more fortunate.</p>
<p>Moreover, the memorial contains the phrase "continue to resist Japan," which shows that the previous rumors of "fleeing upon seeing over a hundred enemies" were not true. The public is foolish, but the army commander is wise. Offending the tiger's might is a capital offense. However, future historians of the Republic of China can deduce from the phrase "continue to resist Japan" that he "once resisted Japan." Are those who resisted Japan not called national heroes? His name will undoubtedly be remembered for centuries. As for the monthly military expenditure of 100,000, it is not expensive. Although it is not enough to support an entire army of soldiers, it can sustain a family of eight (or sixteen or thirty-two) for a long time. Young Marshal Zhang does not seem to have such good fortune because he thought of going abroad to see the legs of foreign women and dance a few more times.</p>
<p>In short, Tang Yulin's journey from chairman to losing territory, from losing territory to being wanted, and from being wanted to being reappointed as army commander is now confirmed. It also shows the government's painstaking efforts to "concentrate national talent to resist foreign aggression." But the worrying thing is whether General Tang's strategy of "continue to resist Japan" will "continue" his past performance. Although we, the common people, are called "fools," we are quite concerned.</p>

<p>— Wang Junqing</p>
<p>Living beings are deluded, dreaming of wealth and power, you alone drift away from the emperor's side. Rather imitate the Western Mountain, eating bitter ferns, than bow to the East Sea, reviving withered mulberries. Sovereignty is seized, a weak king is made a pawn, the record of slavery is clear, the Manchu race is disgraced. Cherish the fragrance of late-blooming chrysanthemums, ashamed of Zheng Wu's extravagance.</p>
<p>Worrying about trivial gains and losses like a chicken pecking at insects, I am known as a useless old thing. I mocked politicians for their early betrayal of their times, dared to call revolutionaries treacherous schemers. Seeking help from Shunshui, which country is appropriate? I am ashamed to be like Gu Yanwu, responsible for this body. I laugh at myself for busying myself ten times in autumn, Chang'e has little connection with me.</p>
<h3 id="e266">The Simplest Method for Converting Between Yuan and Liang <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Chong</p>
<p>Recently, several methods for converting between yuan and liang have been published in this newspaper. However, these methods are either circuitous and complicated or require memorizing complicated formulas. I believe everyone considers them inadequate. Now, I will explain the method I want to use and discuss it with everyone. If you think it is the "simplest method for converting between yuan and liang," please use it to facilitate bookkeeping.</p>
<p>According to the current reform of abolishing the tael and adopting the yuan, it is stipulated that 0.715 taels of silver are equivalent to 1 silver yuan, which means that each tael of silver is worth 1.3986 yuan. This is only 0.0014 yuan less than 1.4 yuan. In mathematical terms, this is a difference of one thousandth. If each tael of silver is multiplied by 1.4, subtracting one-thousandth from the product will give 1.3986 yuan. Following this analogy, regardless of how many taels of silver there are, using the above method, one multiplication and one subtraction, will immediately yield the desired result. Let's demonstrate with an example:</p>
<p>Question: There are 356 taels of silver. How many silver yuan is this equivalent to?</p>
<p>356 × 1.4 = 498.4  498.4 - 0.4984 = 497.9016 yuan</p>
<p>The abbreviated calculation is:</p>
<p>(356 × 1.4) - (356 × 0.0014) = 498.4 - 0.4984 = 497.9016 yuan</p>
<p>As demonstrated by the above example, this simple method provides an accurate conversion between yuan and liang. Moreover, only one number needs to be memorized: "1.4" and the subtracted "one-thousandth." Also, with the "one-thousandth," you only need to recognize the position. The size of the number will be the same as the digits in the product, making it very easy to calculate.</p>

<p>The sun shines on the west window of our classroom, and the row of seats next to the wall is bathed in the warm sunlight. The school's disciplinary officers have also taken their posts. I was absorbed in "In Darkness," because the content of this book was truly miserable. So, I took a breath of fresh air by the west window. Suddenly, a classmate wearing glasses, with a Chinese-style top and a Western-style bottom (truly a combination of East and West), and a national salvation aviation badge, a school badge, and a disciplinary officer badge all shining brightly in the white light on his long gown. What a presence! What a debonair!</p>
<p>However, he was holding a large piece of coal ash in his hand and throwing it into the alley. After a while, he turned back and picked up another piece, continuing to throw it into the alley. So, one piece, two pieces, three pieces, four pieces, ... and from the alley, one piece, two pieces, three pieces, four pieces, ... were returned.</p>
<p>A primary school student next to him cried. He -- the classmate -- the brave disciplinary officer seemed to be unaware of this sound and continued his game of throwing.</p>
<p>"Ding-dong! ... Ding-dong! ...!" The preparatory bell rang, and the disciplinary officer's service time was over. -- This is stipulated by the school authorities. When the preparatory bell rings, the disciplinary officers must rest! -- Strange! His work -- his game was also stopped by the ding-dong bell!</p>
<p>Ah! Is that what the responsibility of a disciplinary officer is supposed to be?!</p>

<p>— Xian</p>
<p>To greedily admire the peach blossoms, I quickened my pace, leaving my companions behind. This was an unknown peach grove, which many people come to admire every season, but like the Peach Blossom Spring, not a few people mysteriously get lost here every year. I walked slowly, the sky was already darkening; my companions had not caught up, and fearing I would lose my way, I stopped to wait for them. Suddenly, a thin, middle-aged man walked towards me, asking sternly, "What are you doing?" I told him that I was watching the peach blossoms and had lost my companions. He changed his expression and said with a smile, "You are lost too, come and sit at my house." Without hesitation, I followed him to a small house. Inside were many people, all looking at me with surprise. The thin, middle-aged man told them the reason, and a child jumped up and said, "This person might be a spy, causing big trouble like last year." The middle-aged man said kindly, "Sir, let us search you." I didn't know what was going on, but after they searched me, the middle-aged man told me, "This place is very far from your China. We are called the Old Country, and we have a small emperor who controls everything. Fearing that the people will rebel, he often sends spies to investigate. Last year, someone like you, sir, came here and got lost, and later caused big trouble; so we are very cautious with you, sir. Please forgive us."</p>
<p>I forgot about my companions who were left behind; I forgot how I would return; and I became curious about the little emperor. That there was still such an autocratic country, I asked the middle-aged man what their political situation was like.</p>
<p>"Isn't everything still decided by the little emperor's will?" he said, "Whether it's domestic or foreign affairs, whatever the little emperor says is what goes."</p>
<p>"Won't the people revolt?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>I knew he didn't understand what "revolt" meant, so I used his own words and asked, "Won't the people resist?"</p>
<p>"On the one hand, he uses secret agents to investigate, and on the other hand, he sets up a high jump machine in public places, allowing people with the ability to jump; the higher they jump, the higher the position they get. As a result, a group of idle people have practiced this skill; even scholars who have read many books can't compare. He has gathered this group of capable people to obey him, so no one dares to resist anymore."</p>
<p>"That's good!" I said, "If idle people become officials, they will wear good clothes, eat good food, obey the little emperor, and won't trample on society anymore."</p>
<p>"Sir, you are truly a foreigner! You only know one thing, but not the other. Those who know the law and break it are even worse than us ordinary people. They pretend to obey the little emperor, swindle his money, and then they collude to exploit us ordinary people. The little emperor trusts them, so who can we ordinary people complain to?" The middle-aged man's eyes filled with tears as he spoke, almost crying.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it seemed as if the door was surrounded, and a shout of "Catch the counter-revolutionaries, catch the counter-revolutionaries!" came from outside. The middle-aged man turned pale with fright.</p>
<p>"Bang!" A gunshot exploded in the air, I opened my eyes and found myself sleeping on the bed in my clothes, a novel in my hand fell to the floor, the clock pointed to eleven o'clock, the wind and rain were raging outside the window, and the unclosed glass window was banging.</p>

<p>Editor Sir:</p>
<p>I am a young child who has lived a hard life since I was young. Since my father lost his job, the economic situation at home has been very difficult. When I was fourteen, I went to work as an apprentice in the Western restaurant of a certain steamer. The acting comprador was very kind, and seeing that I had no hope of success there, he was kind enough to introduce me to your company in this port as a trainee. This company is really too big, so it is divided into many parts; it must be my fate, the head of my department is too outrageous. Every day when he comes to the company, he only knows how to drink and smoke, and doesn't care about official business. Our trainees' work is equivalent to doing his personal chores; buying wine, buying food, we are constantly busy. One day he asked me to buy wine, but the weather was not good, and it started to rain heavily, so my clothes were completely soaked from top to bottom, and I couldn't find an inch of dry space. To my misfortune, the supervisor happened to see me. I immediately hid the wine bottle; unexpectedly, he saw that I was soaked and thought I was playing outside, so he reprimanded me severely. This delayed the time for a long time, so the head of my department was also very angry and kept scolding me. I had to swallow this anger and tears. Unexpectedly, the company seems to ignore this kind of department head who gets paid but doesn't do anything, but our small employees' mistakes are severely investigated: by the end of the month, I was fired! Alas! Sir, as I write this, I am almost crying without tears, please advise me. Respectfully, Shen Guoli.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Being a slave is of course very hard, but if you are a slave to one party, there is always a way to deal with it. The most unfortunate thing is to be a slave to many parties; pleasing this party will inevitably offend that party, and pleasing that party will inevitably offend this party. When we are in this situation, we must know our dangerous position, seek survival in death, and at least get rid of one of the constraints. Even if things don't work out and we are harmed, we must understand that this is a difficulty that we will encounter sooner or later, and there is no room for regret. If Mr. Shen had told the company authorities about the head of the department's situation, he might have been praised. Even if you don't want to offend anyone, then when you are seen and scolded by the supervisor, you should have told the truth. Now you have always protected him, but he is afraid that he will not have any sympathy for your dismissal! Mr. Shen's situation is now a foregone conclusion and cannot be saved; we hope that you will know how to deal with yourself when you encounter this situation again in the future. At the same time, we also hope that those in power must focus on the big picture when evaluating the performance of their subordinates: even if a small employee occasionally plays for a moment, it will not cause a big impact; but if a department head drinks and smokes all day long, it must be rectified!</p>

<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>If it were someone else, they would certainly not want to hold this empty title with great power falling by the wayside, but Wu Yi根本 (genben, fundamentally) did not hope to seize any power, so he felt very comfortable. Every day, he would hide in his office alone, drinking a little wine and returning home drunk. However, once he became the principal, a group of people paid attention to him. Before long, the nickname "Brandy Principal" became as well-known as "Christian General" and "Monk Dean" in Nanjing.</p>
<p>(13) The Lover's Son</p>
<p>Boxes of brandy, wrapped in silver paper and tied with straw all around, were transported from the foreign goods store. In a few days, they would all be empty and carried away by the junk collectors. Wu Yi's puppet-like leadership life passed by like a dream in such a simple environment.</p>
<p>I can't remember how many years have passed, but I know that the short hair on Wu Yi's head has changed from a small half white and a large half black to a large half white and a small half black. This year, the political stage in China has, as usual, seen another change of famous actors, which is not surprising at all; but this change of cast had a small impact on Wu Yi. It turned out that his old boss, the Minister of Education, had spent the past few years safely overcoming four or five difficult hurdles and maintaining his original position, but this time, unexpectedly, the President of the Executive Yuan sent him a directive to "immediately suspend his duties and await further appointment." So he had to roll out of office, and his departure also took away the two director-generals around Wu Yi. When they left, Wu Yi also hurriedly packed his things, preparing to leave, because he expected that when the new minister took office, he, the ancestral tablet-like university president, would have to give way to another talent. Who knew that this new minister was precisely a former student of his at the XX Political School, and still a tenderfoot official who had just taken office. Seeing the teacher-student relationship, he was embarrassed to ask him to leave. In addition to sending his younger brother to be the director of general affairs, he also returned half of the power over academic affairs to Wu Yi. This really made Wu Yi both happy and afraid as he held his wine glass.</p>
<p>Before, if someone asked him: "About how many students are there in your school?" Or: "Which students in your school are more active?" his answer would definitely be a shake of his head: because besides sitting in the principal's office drinking, he didn't care about anything else, and actually, it wasn't his turn to care. So he didn't even know how many professors and hundreds of students there were in his school. Since his proud student had returned half of his political power to him, he gradually got a clue, and at the same time, he also discovered that his eldest son, Wu Yuan, was a senior in the third year of the school, and also a very active backbone member of the student union.</p>
<p>Wu Yi was truly a pitiful person with many twists and turns in his fate. When he was a puppet, the school affairs of X University were very smooth, and there were never any unfortunate incidents. After he sat in the golden palace and personally attended court, serious problems followed. The first and most difficult was the students' patriotic movement.</p>

<p>— Hua Ming</p>
<p>The first person in Hollywood to have adventurous stunts was Bob Rose. During the silent film era, he caused a sensation in countries around the world in "Avenging Arrow" and "Haunted Valley." At that time, he was an actor and was with Universal Pictures. After these two films came out, Bob performed in New York and almost lost his life due to carelessness. He was seriously injured and was forced to rest and recuperate in a mental institution for more than a year. After his recovery, stunt films in Hollywood declined. Although a few were made, they were all insignificant.</p>
<p>Although Bob Rose did not work in Hollywood after his recovery, he was only about thirty years old and still had ambitions. How could he give up and bury his skills? So he was eager to try. RKO Pictures was looking for talent in this area due to the lack of stunt films. As soon as they learned that Bob's health had recovered, they immediately sent someone to invite him. Bob agreed, and it was just what he wanted.</p>
<p>The first stunt film that RKO hired Bob Rose to perform in was called "Lucky Devils." In addition to Bob, the actors were all well-known experts in American martial arts. However, after the actors were determined, the director could not be found despite repeated efforts. Ordinary directors were not competent, and good directors had no experience in stunts. In the end, RKO sent Bob to take on the role himself. Bob did not decline and readily accepted. "Lucky Devils" does not have terrible makeup, nor does it use scientific equipment to create terrible shapes, but from beginning to end, there is not a single scene that does not make people's hair stand on end. Jumping out of a plane, jumping from this plane to that plane, jumping off the top of a speeding train, rolling down from the top of a high, steep cliff in the mountains, falling into a huge waterfall. If it were off by a fraction of an inch, it would hit a sharp mountain rock and could immediately turn into meat paste.</p>
<p>After "Lucky Devils" was completed, although it went through many dangerous situations, fortunately, all the actors were only injured and did not sacrifice their lives. Bob was also slightly injured during work, but he did not rest. Two actors almost drowned in the raging tide several feet high, which was the most dangerous moment of the entire work.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e272">Re-Review of "The Great Man" <a href="#e272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— Li Qiong</p>
<p>It is very obvious that in order to meet the progressive needs of the general audience, Chinese films such as "Fire Burning" and "Great Swordsman" have lost their appeal. The Yueming Company, which has always strived for "Great Swordsman of the Guandong", has also had to change direction and engage in love stories.</p>
<p>Of course, we do not deny that love affairs can sometimes meet the needs of movies, and can even enrich the content of the film with love as the outer garment. However, the makers of "The Great Man" completely fail to understand these important points, and only attempt to somersault in the mire of multi-faceted love affairs. Of course, there will be no new tricks discovered.</p>
<p>The story itself is very nonsensical, so the progress on the screen is completely far-fetched. Although some of it depicts the fierceness of the warlord, it only describes some extremely unimportant and unreasonable events in which he helps his son grab a woman out of his doting love for his son, and it fails to grasp a greater center and promote the anti-warlord theme. Even in terms of details, such as Fan Tong calling himself his elder brother, 文柏's (Wen Bo's) "scheming" to earn money, and escaping in disguise, are all very ridiculous.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, of course, a perfect film cannot be performed based on a base story. The director's use of the camera is too unskilled in changing angles. He does not have a proper understanding of the roles in the play, so that the people in the play become nondescript in the direction of the performance. Most of the actors are too civilized and theatrical, especially Wang Dongxia, which makes people embarrassed. Many over-the-top performances inevitably make people cringe. Wu Lizhu's belly is too big, and she should have rested. Since this is the case, of course she cannot be lively. Both exterior and interior scenes are not good. The lighting is blurry, and there are too many and childish subtitles.</p>
<p>Overall, one cannot help but call it a "failure." However, compared to "Great Swordsman of the Guandong" and the like, it is still a step forward.</p>
<p>Audience Opinion</p>
<h3 id="e273">Further Discussion of "Storm Over Asia" <a href="#e273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Yinzhong</p>
<p>Hope it can be shown everywhere in the mainland</p>
<p>The movies we usually watch are nothing more than "glamour," "sensuality," "romance," "mystery," etc. At best, these kinds of movies only show the breasts and jade legs of women, and the suits and top hats of gentlemen; they only show strong wine and intoxicating songs and dances! We can say that we have seen enough of this kind of movie, why not have movies that are the opposite to change our taste, such as "A New Life", "Reunion", which were shown in Shanghai in the past, and "Storm Over Asia", which is currently being shown? These Soviet Russian films can provide us with this kind of demand.</p>
<p>Really, Soviet Russian films are absolutely different from what we usually watch. Not only are the stories performed different, but the performance techniques are also different. They can not only change our taste, but also give us new and great inspirations!</p>
<p>"Storm Over Asia" is set in Mongolia, China, and vividly depicts how weak nations are subjected to the aggression and oppression of powerful capitalist imperialism, and how weak nations rise up to resist and defeat capitalist imperialism. This is indeed a rare and valuable good film. I hope that this film can continue to be shown everywhere in our country. At a time when the national crisis is serious, strong enemies are invading, and even more brutal, it can at least awaken the dreams of the general public and inspire the spirit of the general public.</p>
<p>Finally, I would also like to add a sentence: Foreigners have always liked to portray Chinese people in extremely ugly ways, making it impossible for people to swallow their meals, such as dragging long braids, smoking opium, and binding small feet. This film is the exact opposite everywhere. From this, we can also understand who is our friend in the world and who is our enemy.</p>
<p>Also, the original name of this film and the previous name, National Soul, are not very appropriate to my liking. It would be better to change it to "Asian National Soul." I wonder what the wise readers think? (Answer requested)</p>
<h3 id="e274">A General Review of "Storm Over Asia": Who Doesn't Feel Their Blood Boiling After Watching It? <a href="#e274" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c274" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">274</a></h3>
<p>The whole film does not have any flaws, but for the ending we want to ask: "Is the victory built on the wind really a victory?" The film probably had to end at this point. It was impossible to continue, and it would be depressing to say that the patriotic group was defeated by the White Army, so they had to borrow the power of the wind and sand. The director's means are extremely clever. The few scenes of duels are very tense, especially the scene where two people fight on a dangerous cliff and fall down, which is even more powerful. The few contrasting scenes also give us strong hints. The process of Temujin's execution by shooting is done slowly, but it is not loose. Step by step, it holds the audience's emotions and makes everyone unwilling to see Temujin die. A puppet transformed into a warrior, very naturally without idealistic elements. The stimulation of the Silver Fox is not enough. Killing a Mongolian in front of him is too stimulating for him, and then a crazy resistance breaks out. When Temujin rushes out, the audience's enthusiasm for resisting is stirred up by the mixed use of inverted and intricate subtitles and frantic waving.</p>
<p>I'm afraid there are very few people who don't feel their blood boiling after watching it? At a time when diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not been severed, the four northeastern provinces have been ceded, the volunteer army outside the Guan has been repeatedly oppressed, and the puppet is sitting firmly in Changchun, what kind of feelings and hints do our viewers get from this film that seems to be shot for us?</p>

<p>— Hong Wei</p>
<p>Tianyi Film Company's recent sound film production, "Vitality", is directed by Shao Zuiweng and stars Chen Yumei, Yuan Meiyun, and Zhang Zhenduo. It is a film about women's issues and has now been completed. There are three new songs in the film, all of which are children's songs with educational meaning and love songs that are more meaningful than ya and mei. Now the lyrics are recorded below:</p>
<p>New Lullaby</p>
<p>My little baby, baby go to sleep quickly! Go to bed early at night, get up early at dawn, the baby is so cute, the face is like a rose, my good sweetheart! Sweetheart little baby! Baby sleepy eyes, sweetheart go to sleep quickly! My good sweetheart! Sweetheart little baby!</p>
<p>Little Baby</p>
<p>(1) Ding Dong! Ding Dong! Knock the little clock, the little baby rides a horse to Shandong, brings back a lantern, lights the lantern to charge.</p>
<p>(2) Di Ling! Di Ling! Shake the copper bell, the little baby rides a horse to Liaoning, brings back an airship, sits on the airship to kill the enemy soldiers.</p>
<p>(3) Tang Tuo! Tang Tuo! Beat the small gong, the little baby rides a horse to Rehe, brings back a camel, sings war songs on the camel's back.</p>
<p>(4) Xu Li! Xu Li! Blow the bamboo flute, the little baby rides a horse to Jiangxi, brings back a national flag, parents smile when they see it.</p>
<p>Butterfly and Bee</p>
<p>(1) Butterfly, fly, fly, fly to the east, fly to the west, fly into the flowers and become fascinated! Flowers are pillows and leaves are quilts, how happy, how comfortable. Ah! Winter is coming, the leaves fall and the flowers fly, the butterfly loses its support, endures the cold, endures the hunger, how miserable?</p>
<p>(2) Bee, buzz, buzz! Fly to the west, fly to the east, work hard, preparing for the future, build nests and brew honey, busy working. Ah! Winter is coming, the wind is cold and the frost is thick, the bee lives in the nest, the food is sufficient, warm and comfortable, endless happiness!</p>

<p>Tianyi News: Tianyi Film Company's new film "Vitality" has been working very hard under the supervision of Shao Zuiweng recently. The other day, forty temporary female actors were used for a scene at the factory gate. A certain introduction agency felt it was difficult to meet Tianyi's needs, because almost all the temporary female actors in Shanghai were accustomed to fashion, and it was really not easy to find many female actors in short clothes and worker appearances. Later, Tianyi shot an interior scene of the factory, requiring sixty female actors of that type. This time, the introduction agency was tired from running around to find them. As a result of searching from morning to night, a total of forty-eight people were found. In the end, they had to resort to kidnapping people to make up the numbers, and only then did they break through the difficult situation, but the scene of this group of short-clothed workers working in the factory was indeed great and realistic.</p>
<p>Jinan News: Jinan Company's "Winning Glory for the Country" has been in production for four months since it started filming last winter, but the economic situation has been bad, so it cannot be finished in one go. The other day, they shot the outdoor scene of the Volunteer Army departing in Longhua. It is said to be the last scene. The entire play was also filmed yesterday, and the release date should not be far away.</p>
<p>Mingxing News: A former employee and artist of Tianyi, Hu Zhuoyun, resigned from Tianyi and transferred to Mingxing. He has been promoted from artist to set designer. It is a pity that he has the temperament of an artist, so Zhang Shichuan is very dissatisfied with him. It is said that Hu Zhuoyun has left Mingxing again. His colleagues who entered Mingxing with Tianyi are very sorry for him.</p>

<p>It is said that Harry Banishter, an old star, is now over ninety years old. He still imitates romance, and he and his wife, Ann Harding, are divorcing in preparation to marry another Miss Nancy Lyon. It is said that she is only twenty years old and is a social butterfly. However, Harry Banishter said: "There is no such thing, there is no such thing, can ninety and twenty be in proportion?"</p>

<p>— Luo Xiu</p>
<p>There are really many old stars in the film industry, and the oldest one is the British old man Fred Kerr, who is already seventy-four years old this year. At the age of seventy, he was still able to perform on the screen, playing an old man. The second is C. Aubrey Smith. In the past few months, he has performed in seven films at the same time, although he is now seventy years old.</p>
<p>As for the world-famous Marie Dressler, she is already sixty-four years old this year, and she is still dominating the screen. The male star who can match her is George Arliss, who is also sixty-four years old this year, and his position in the film industry is almost equal.</p>

<p>— Mei Hua</p>
<p>General Grelg and Orlov's warships were anchored near Princess Raknarova's palace, like white geese floating on the water, adding a touch of elegance to the palace. Orlov, mingling with the cheering crowds, encountered Princess Tarakanova! Her alluring eyes reminded him of the Gypsy girl he had met during the Turkish war! At this moment, amidst the cheers and jumps of the crowd, singing Gypsy love songs, she disappeared in a flash, just like on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Orlov, arriving happily and leaving dejectedly, felt as if he had lost his soul. He thought to himself: "How did I meet her again? Isn't she the Gypsy girl I met at the front line that day? Heavens!" He finally exhausted all means to meet this beautiful princess. He poured all his spirit into her eyes. He recognized her, no, she recognized him too! From that moment on, Orlov visited the beautiful Princess Tarakanova every day, their hearts beating as one.</p>
<p>However, General Grelg, who had come with him, did not understand Orlov's feelings and kept urging him to lure Princess Raknarova back to Russia according to the pre-arranged plan! Torn between "love" and "loyalty to duty," Orlov hesitated for a long time. He dared not disobey Catherine, and finally invited Princess Raknarova to his warship. Princess Tarakanova accepted his request, adorned with pearls and emeralds, looking like a celestial being. She stepped onto the warship, laid out like a net of heaven and earth by General Grelg and Orlov. Cannons boomed, the national flag fluttered on the mast, and music drifted in the wind. Princess Raknarova dreamed of returning to Moscow and holding a grand coronation ceremony amidst the cheers of the crowd, with her lover Orlov following her closely!</p>
<p>However, such joyous moments are only a fleeting instant in life! Princess Raknarova only enjoyed this little bit. When the warship sailed into Russian territory, all the hideous and ugly faces broke through the beautiful façade. The lover who had always been considered gentle and kind now transformed into a sinister and treacherous poisonous creature.</p>
<p>Princess Tarakanova was captured. Although captured, she could not abandon her love for Orlov; indeed, Orlov was lovable. His handsome appearance and majestic figure were enough to make Tarakanova infatuated and unforgettable. However, Orlov's heart was also shattered like flower petals. Under Catherine's tyrannical power, he dared not resist her demands, and finally brought his lover, Princess Tarakanova, to meet her.</p>
