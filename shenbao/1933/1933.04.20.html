<p>時評</p>
<h3>民族之前途如何？吾人將何以自處？企·</h3>
<p>我國自民十九以還。水災之後。繼以暴日之侵凌。内亂方殷。復值外侮之日亟。天災人禍。内憂外患。舉人類史上所有之顚危困厄。殆無一而不畢具。更無一而不嚴重。於是憂時之士。率多陸沉之慨。而樂觀者流。轉認爲新時代降臨之象徵。民族之前途如何。吾人將何以自處。此誠當前最嚴重之一問題也。　　民族之出路。見諸史册者。千頭萬緒。然歸而納之。不外二端。由治以求治一也。由亂以求治。又其一也。俾斯麥克之鐵腕政治。明治之維新圖强。以致墨索里尼之反動獨裁。均由治以求治者也。華盛頓之獨立革命。列寗之鏟除階級。以至凱末爾之外抗强權。均由亂以求治者也。要之勞師動衆。流血犧牲。不問其目標爲向外之抗爭。抑爲内部之革命。均不外爲民族之一種變亂。變亂之甚。則因天演淘汰之亢進。不適宜之制度。不適宜之事物。蕩掃廓清。外在内伏之矛盾旣去。厭亂之人心復萌。社會之秩序。自歸安寗。於是從容以言建設。而治致矣。反之倘制度之矛盾未著。社會之病象未深。則立法糾正。尚易爲力。或人心業已厭亂。而破壞之行動未終。則和平建設。必甚易得人信仰。於是一面以政治勞力維持社會之秩序。一面以立法手段緩和制度之矛盾。循序漸進而治致矣。</p>
<p>中國目下種種一切之矛盾。猶爲調和糾正之所能爲功乎。中國目下社會之病態。猶爲頭痛治頭脚痛治脚之方劑所能奏效乎。分析言之。中日間之矛盾。能以敷衍因循之手段解决之乎。因農村破産而起之暴動。能以收撫剿治之方式弭平之乎。青年之憤悶將士之激昻。能以一紙訓令。而令其少安毋躁乎。世界潮流之澎湃。人民思想之轉移。能以半部論語幾句格言。而令其潛移默化乎。凡諸疑問。恐當局者亦大都不能爲肯定之答辭。則中國民族之出路。其必趨向於由亂以求治之一途。或爲已然之大勢。此當局者之所以不能不一再以對日抗爭爲號召也。</p>
<p>言對日之抗爭而限於「敵來即拚」之消極方策。言抗爭而不公然言戰。言抗爭而不即速置全國於戰時狀態之下。言抗爭而祗令人民安於鎭靜。保守秩序。若是。其足以減少現制度之矛盾乎。其足以饜人民之熱望乎。盜匪臨門。而囑子弟之誦讀自若。火焰入室。而望姑嫂之紡織如昔。勢均有所不可。亂之已至。固不能再言治。而由亂以求治。自更須有處亂之方。至平時之法術。固難望其適用於處亂也。</p>
<p>以言抗爭。則安内攘外之先後。復成問題。下絶大之决心以抗日。則士氣振奮。人民歡忭。一轉移間。而民族之生機立見。此主張攘外先於安内之說也。先求腹地之安寧。乃足以言長期之抵抗。清後方之擾亂。乃足以固抗日之軍心。此攘外必先安内之說也。自「夫子道衰。」經書失效。舉一問題。正反均能言之成理。是非之混淆若此。究孰爲可循之途徑乎。則應之曰。世間　事實最爲雄辯。亦唯大勢爲無可違抗。攘外必先安内乎。安内必先攘外乎。吾人依事實加以判斷。就大勢加以推測可矣。</p>

<h3>前綫寄來的信</h3>
<p>士兵充滿愛國觀念</p>
<p>民衆慰勞絡繹不絶</p>
<p>唐山傷兵醫院江文漢君、頃來函報告在戰地工作情形、文云、我們在唐山兵站醫院辦的青年會服務工作、現在算有些頭緒了、青年會室設備許多報紙·畫報·書籍·象棋·跳棋·陸軍棋·陞官　·茶水和留聲機、壁上掛的、是有敎育價值的圖表和戰區地圖等等、我們又替傷兵寫信、預備信紙信幇郵票、在過去的三四天、每天總得寫十多封、有的是寄到家裏去的、有的是寄給各人、也有連排長報告受傷情情的、</p>
<p>一封家書</p>
<p>昨天有一個傷兵接到他母親寄來的信、上面這樣寫着、「明山吾兒、昨接你的來信、才知道你們開到了前方與那慘無人道的日本帝國主義者拚命、槍傷左臂、爲民族爭生存而戰、乃是應分的事、可是不知吾兒受傷輕重、速來信寫明爲要、家中老幼都好、但很想念你、望兒傷愈可回家一望、以安老幼之心、去年收穫很壞、咱家的地、都呌人分種或租種的、租價人家是不給的、分種的地、因爲虫災和水災的關係、也分不到多少糧食、又在這春荒的時候、捐稅疊出、車馬騾夫屢徵、村中人民、莫不低頭嘆氣、甚憂其苦、一家生活很難維持、你大哥今年在山西榆次三育學校敎書、你四弟還在山西交城憲兵第四隊、望吾兒傷愈回家一望爲要、千萬千萬、母字」、這個傷兵不識字、所以他要我讀給他聽、我讀的時候、眞是覺着一字一淚、第一段她母親是勉勵他爲國家拚命、後一段是細述鄉村老百姓的苦楚、這就是我們的中國、這就是我們的同胞、誰無父母、這種母親給她兒子說出這種話、眞是令人感憤百倍、</p>
<p>愛國男兒</p>
<p>現在士兵們的知識、較以前高的多、他們知道要愛國、不願意做亡國奴、一次受了傷、他們還希望早日的好、再回前線與敵人拚命、家不要緊、國家要緊、好些傷兵寫家信時、終不向父母提及受傷的事、怕使他們罣慮、我心在想受了傷還可寫個信兒回家哄着父母、若是在前線陣亡了、連哄父母的音信都没有了、可憐多少男兒、都是這樣無聲無嗅的絶了跡、</p>
<p>醫院概况</p>
<p>此處兵站醫院、係華北軍第　軍團所設立、現有傷兵四百餘人、多屬冷口至石門寨前線運回的、這所兵站醫院、開辦極其怱促、因陋就簡、很算有點規模、院長章飛仙、爲人誠懇、辦事亦極認眞、全院現有九個病室、每病室所容傷兵四五十不等、自開辦以來、各地與各機關前來慰勞的、絡繹不絶、正可以表示軍民一致、共赴國難的精神、軍人們也深深明白這次原是對外作戰、才有許多民衆前來慰勞、要是内戰的話、怕就無人問津了、</p>
<p>非常歡迎</p>
<p>傷兵對於青年會非常歡迎、我們除在醫院設「青年會室」外、每日輪流到各病室慰問、並放留聲機、好些遊戲器具、已經分送到各病室、給那班不能移動的傷兵享受、我們也預備了一點微薄的慰勞品、傷兵每人分得手巾一條、肥皂一塊、我又和此地的交通大學工程學院·第四中學·豐灤中學等聯絡、希望有些學生願意自動的來到各病室替傷兵演講寫信和慰問、現在長川在青年會室主持的、除我以外、還有一位天津的毛鑑庭君、</p>

<h3>公共租界納稅西人</h3>
<p>昨開年會及特别會</p>
<p>通過新預算及修改地産章程</p>
<p>選出地産委員公濟醫院董事</p>
<p>本埠公共租界納稅西人、於昨日下午四時起、假靜安寺路大光明影戲院召開本年度年會及特别會、通過新預算及修改洋涇浜地産章程等、并選出新地産委員與公濟醫院董事、至休士氏所提議之購地設立市政廳案經討論多時、結果仍否决、兹分誌其情形於後、</p>
<p>到會踴躍</p>
<p>本年度公共租界納稅西人年會、業於昨日下午四時、假座大光明影戲院舉行、本届因年會完畢後、將接開特别會議、討論修正附律、加入工廠領照規定、曾由各國商會、先期勸告納稅人到會、滿足法定人數、故到會納稅人、較諸往年、大爲踴躍、工部局特雇汽車、自三時四十五分起至五時止、往來南京路口浦灘與大光明影戲院間、免費載送納稅人到會、公共汽車公司亦於三時三十分、在靜安寺與提籃橋、各開專車、至大光明影戲院前、僅收尋常車資、以便赴會納稅人乘坐、</p>
<p>年會情形</p>
<p>年會於下午四時正開會、由白克氏主席、并推定秘書後、卽開始由總董貝爾演說報告一切、旋將議案一一通過、至四時四十五分、卽開始討論、休十氏所提議之購地設立市政廳案、此案經一小時之爭論、卒因日董岡本與總董貝爾二人之反對、經多時解釋、卒予否决、至五時四十五分始畢、會議程序、第一案推舉主席、第二案推舉書記、第三案通過會塲規則　　次議第四案</p>
<p>工部局總董裴爾報告過去一年之行政及財政狀况云、主席及諸君、鄙人循照前例、不以局中例行公事在此陳說、因年度報告書、業已印送諸君、可備參閱、今僅就值得特别注意之事件言之、上年一年中、政治之情形、日内瓦及華北發生之事故、皆與本租界之情形、不無關係、本租界旣係有國際性質、故無論工部局、抑或任何國在滬僑民、對於現今正在爭持中之兩大民族、皆須極力避免有傷其民族的情感、本租界之處境、其危險實顯而易見、星星之火、可以燎原、不可不愼、對於如此之局面、鄙人不欲加以評論、但上年度之報告中、關於此項政治情形之經過、有一段紀載、可資參閱也、</p>
<p>界外馬路問題</p>
<p>一九三○年七月、工部局得若干國駐滬代表之默許、實行與中國官廳討論界外馬路區域問題、以期求得一種解决之基礎、中國官廳、態度頗好、經過初步接洽若于時之後、雙方决定派出特别代表、商談細目、並隨時報告於雙方之主腦、不期因中日政情之多故、遷延至去年七月、乃能對於主要各點、商得一種辦法、似頗可以中國政府及工部局與納稅公衆之許可、惟以中日之關係、交涉又於此時、發生複雜之情形、日本當道表示、在所擬之辦法中、未將日本利益充分考慮、後此接洽遂行暫停、以便本局以努力消弭此種困難、因此本局遂與日本領館會商、第因事情之性質、致進行頗爲遲緩、此際殊不能預料結果之如何、惟本局對於將來之滿意解决、並未失望也、</p>
<p>特區法院問題</p>
<p>特區法院之三年協定、係於本年三月底滿期、上届年會中、前任總董雖表示、希望此次取得較爲滿意之辦法、不期該協定於今年二月八日又經商定展期三年、故此項希望、未能達到、但此次之換文中、中國當局聲明、對於民事案之上訴及執行等類之延遲、已在計劃改良、甚望此項計畫得以實現、至此次雖未能獲得更爲滿意之辦法、但各國代表、於考慮各種情勢之下、諒已盡其所能爲矣、</p>
<p>各種公用事業</p>
<p>電話·電力·自來水·各公司、在上年皆曾與中國官廳接洽界外區域之供給問題、本局亦盡力協助商談、其中僅電話公司之接洽頗有進步其情形已具見於報告書、至自來水公司、因普裝水表、曾遭嚴重反對、此問題頗複雜、兹不克詳論、請參看報告書、</p>
<p>敎育經費問題</p>
<p>上届總董報告、謂已撥欵十五萬兩、以備輔助界内優良之中外私立學校、此項補助、業已分發、計華人各校得百分之五十五、外童各校得百分之四十五、上年有華童小學兩所、建築完成、另外一校、租屋開辦、西童學校宿舍一處、亦已完成開用、今年（一九三三）華童之敎育費、業已超過外童學校之數、其比例爲五十一對四十九、此係本界歷史上之初次、計一九三三年之敎育費、較一九三二年加多一成、其增多之數、幾全爲華童之需、惟西童之利益、亦未漠視、今年之建築計畫、即有外童新校兩所、至華童小學、本年不擬添造、但華人女子中學之新校舍則在新加坡路、卽將動工、現在敎育之費、約共等於本界捐稅收入之十分之一、將來是否應將稅收之一定成分、指定爲敎育費、殊值得審愼考慮也、</p>
<p>上年賬目報告</p>
<p>上年經常收支、原計當有一萬餘兩之赢餘、但結果虧五三、四八○兩、中日事變、頗影響於稅收、計北區東區減免之捐欵、凡達三十九萬兩、此外收入部分、又短收五六五、八四○兩、幸各處極力緊縮、對於馬路維持費、亦加削減、故結果大概尚屬滿意、敎育費預算、現已單獨開列、以便將此項所需、得以明白表出、至上年敎育費所以虧短五萬六千餘兩、乃因前一年度之一部份補助費、係在上年付出之故、又查上年之臨時預算、收支兩方、皆較預計爲少、一則因償還一九二二公債、已延至本年辦理、一則因擬行出售之某項地皮、尚未脫手、而敎育項下之建築費、未動者約十萬兩之譜、亦已移付本年預算下、鄙人所欲說明者、如此、今提議將截至一九三二年十二月三十一日之年度報告及賬目、予以通過、</p>
<p>接議第五案</p>
<p>總董裴爾提出一九三三年度預算案、加以說明云、一九三三年度之預算書及附帶之說明、已印送諸君、鄙人今僅就財政方針上重大之點、略加說明、</p>
<p>本年度之收入</p>
<p>除彌補上年虧項外</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>、約計有一六、四八四、六二○兩、較上年約加多七十五萬兩、此項增加、大部係在市政總捐及地稅、上海地價、自上　估計後、大致均已高漲、爲稅收之均平計、地價重估、正在進行、今已將竣、自本年七月一日後、地稅卽將依據新估之數徵收、關於市政總捐、房主自居之房、已重加估計、今擬加速辦理、以期此項産業、得以擔任其相當之捐額、此外收入項目、多見增加、此係自然發展之故、惟碼頭捐將較上年所計短少二十六萬、此節已經有說明、收入部分内、撥出一、六二三、四九○兩、歸入敎育費預算、此數約爲金額十分之一、照現有之計畫、將來敎育費將日益加鉅、在最近之將來、或須對於敎育方針及費用、整個的重行考慮也、</p>
<p>經常支出方面</p>
<p>連敎育經常費、共一六、二四七、四○○兩、對於支出之膨漲業已盡力節制、惟上海旣日益發展、則市政設施、自不能不與之俱進、而爲安全及效率計、則設備不得不增、現各行政部分、皆極明瞭緊縮之必要、而對於需有鉅大及按年支出之新計畫、不能不極度愼審從事、諒諸君亦表同情、</p>
<p>經常預算虧短</p>
<p>一、三八六、二七○兩、此約等於二釐之市政捐三季之收數、若在通常狀態之下、只有增捐、以求平衡、第因鑒於現今商業之凋敝、而本埠於上年亂後亦未盡復元、故認爲宜以他法、求得平衡、所幸本局之準備金、尚有相當之數可撥、因乃撥出一百五十萬、以資抵補、惟有不能不特别說明者、卽此項準備金、係近數年由於出售電氣之所積存、非能取之不竭、今年以此策將預算平衡、不過係將市政捐必不可免之增加、予以展緩而已、</p>
<p>論及臨時預算</p>
<p>本年應支之數爲三○、四四八、五七○兩、内有敎育費臨時費五二六、一五○兩、償還公債費二一、五六六、二五○兩、完成業已興工之事業、約需二百七十萬兩、又另外建設事業之費、約四百萬兩、此乃爲公衆利益必不可缺之設施也、</p>
<p>臨時收入方面</p>
<p>電台處售價最後一批、將於本年内付清、擬由此中撥出四百萬兩、歸入減債基金之内、又公家餘地、上年未售脫者、本年可望售出、故列入此項進欵、此外則請納稅人准允另行借債六、五二○、○○○兩、今提議、一九三三年度預算案内所列之支出各欵及附帶之建議、由本年會批准採納、並命令工部局、按照所開捐稅項目、予以徵收、並准董事會斟酌借債、不逾六、五二○、○○○兩、以充臨時預算内之指定用途、</p>
<p>接議第六案</p>
<p>提議修改土地章程第十八欵、改善選舉手續、總董裴爾說明云、查土地章程第十八欵規定、關於選舉董事之手續、此係多年以前所擬定、今已多不適宜、今此所擬之修正、第一·可使將來得酌設若干投票所、以便利投票人、第二·擬删除投票人自行在票上簽名之規定、以期完全簽合現代之秘密投票之理想、第三·現今之規定、投票時間爲上午十時至下午三時、兹擬改爲上午八時至下午六時、以期多數投票人、得以便利第四·對於檢票員、不復限定數目、俾可多派人員、庶投票結果、於截止之日、卽晚可以揭曉、惟此項之修正提議、一設納稅人或不免生一疑問、即第十八欵之外、其他更重要之條欵、何以不提議修改是也、此問題之答案、即係修改土地章程、必須得中國當局之允許、方能生效、第十八欵之修正、完全不影響於中國之主權、故中國當局不致反對、如修改他條、則難免反對耳、今提議、由本會動議修改土地章程第十八欵、並令董事會向有關係之國家接洽、其修改之點、爲一、將「投票處所」改爲「每一投票處所」、二、將投票人「自行簽名」四字删除、三、將「上午十時至下午三時」、改爲「上午八時至下午六時」、四、特派定「二檢票員」之「二」字删去、</p>
<p>討論第九條</p>
<p>稅納人、休士所建議購地設市政廳事件、工部局不甚贊同、總董裴爾演說云、諸君、現在經提出之議案、並未道及大華地皮、只欲令本局購一新地皮、以備建市廳及市中心、但此案之背後、顯然係謀將一九三一年年會大多數否决之議案、重行提起、蓋如此案通過、則本局似不能不將該地皮重爲考慮也、在說明本局反對購該地之理由以前、鄙人願將此事金錢上之關係、略爲提及、據吾人所知、大華地皮、在一九三○年五月購自原主之時、價爲二、七二五、○○○兩、後其中一小部分售出、又一部可動之裝修亦售出、於是地皮實餘五十八畝五分九厘三毫、實費二、四四○○○○兩、一九三一年二月底、據有資格之估價人估計、該産業實值不逾二百七十萬兩、而是月所提出擬售與本局之價、則爲四、一○一、五一○兩、並要求以本局辦公處之地交換、而作價三、八四○、○○○兩、此數據估計又較所值短一、五○一、七○六兩、果爾、則一轉手之間、彼方可得利二、九○三、二一六兩矣、旋於是年三月三日、彼方將第一擬議撤消而由業廣公司出面、將大華地皮議售與本局、作價三百五十萬兩、不再談買本局地基一層、但卽如此、而彼方仍有八十萬之利益、今度向本局提出之售價、爲三、九一○、○○○兩、據合格之人評判、仍較其他所值、高出五十萬兩、故此事實、不必再多加評論、外間滑稽傳言、或指此舉爲誰應負抱孩子」之責任而已、主張購大華地皮之主要理由、係說大華地址宜於設市中心、而現今本局之辦公處、房已陳舊不適用、非卽速改建不可、不知市中心區、按歐美通行之見解、則大華地皮、完全不敷應用、試往江灣一　市政府所經營之市中心計畫、即可明瞭矣、至謂現今辦公處之如何陳舊不適、亦係過甚其詞、蓋其中餘地尚多、可供添建、而中央巡捕房及救火隊新　完成後、足可以其舊址、建一能容二千人之市廳、（情使欲建之）並供其他之用、且現今辦公處、地點便利、在地理亦屬合中、固然局中辦事人遷地亦能一樣辦事、但假令將局所向西移動兩英里、則往局中赴會、或有事接洽者、皆將深爲不便、又或以中央區地價甚高、局所在此、不適於經濟、果爾、則在中區及外灘之房主多矣、何以不謀遷移、現今辦公處地皮、當日係零碎購人、平均每畝不過費二萬八千兩、最多者每畝亦不逾五萬兩、如果建造一宏麗之市廳、究應現在抑將來造之、固爲問題、但普通言之、在大多數大城市中、市廳已爲過時之物、歐美各大城、多不以公欵建公衆集會之所、而聽私人爲之、彼中人士、不以爲羞、奈何上海於此經濟困難之時、獨計及於此乎、</p>
<p>且歐美城市、費欵建築壯麗之市廳、其大部分居民、固皆得而利用之、但上海實乃東方人之城市、外僑僅佔極少數、至大多數居民、所最需者、乃醫院·學校·及空場·而其處要之程度、遠非現今市政收入所能供給、醫務調查委員會所建議之事項、即需二百五十萬兩、如其實行、則居民所得利益、遠勝於費巨額欵項、以謀發展大華地皮也、在主張購買大華地皮之議論中、又有一點、卽係欲有一宏大之市廳、及其他建築、以便旅客得一好印象、藉免其注意本市之不甚美觀之劣點、此種見解、實無需置辯、鄙人深望今日到會諸君、無論個人意見、是否願將來有一新市廳、但對於一切計議欲使本局被牽入購取大華地皮、以致糜費公欵之舉動、斷然反對之也、</p>
<p>特會經過</p>
<p>年會旣畢、遂繼續開特别會、主席仍由白克氏擔任、總董裴爾報告云、本局對於界内工業界情形、關切已有多年、有許多華人或外人廠主、對於工人之幸福、甚見注意、其廠房等設備、尚屬滿意、然而多數之工廠、則對於預防危險毫無準備、故作工之男女及兒童在此等處所、乃冒險求生活、實非近代市政所應納稅西人年會（蔣松齡攝）</p>

<h3>新仁和輪中謀殺案</h3>
<p>五小販被投海中慘死</p>
<p>船上夾帶毒品爲警局查獲</p>
<p>疑小販洩漏秘密謀斃五命</p>
<p>撫卹死者家屬此案始發覺</p>
<p>南京楊家渡街第一零四號裕興輪船公司、總經理顧少卿、協理王冠仙、置有新仁和輪船一艘、平日專事裝運客貨、往來於北沙海門一帶、營業極爲發達、惟本年三月間、該輪上夾帶大批毒品、由海門運到上海、擬行銷售、不料事機不密、爲滬地警局得悉、遂派警前往、檢查之下、即將所藏之大批毒品一併搜出、帶回訊究、</p>
<p>銜恨小販洩漏風聲</p>
<p>事後該輪上人役、遂疑向在輪上呌賣食物之小販馬扣寳·梅老二·周大通·魏金成·孫錫良·等五人所通風、銜恨之下、遂起殺心、乃於本月十二日、乘輪由海門開馳來申之際、中途由輪上水手黄福生等、將馬等五人一併拘住、拳足交加、施以毆打、後即報告船主孫杏生知悉、</p>
<p>毒毆一頓懸吊船頂</p>
<p>其時適協理王冠仙亦在輪上、據報後即與船主孫吉生·買辦郭錫候·副買辦陳葆生·二副王墨清·大領江陳應龍·二領江馮福生等商議之下、即將馬等用繩索綑起、吊於船頂上、用鐵棍等大施毆打、直至馬等遍體受傷、鮮血淋漓、氣息奄奄之時、乃逐一放下、閉入第十一號房艙中、</p>
<p>盛入蔴袋投之海中</p>
<p>未幾内中一人、不知如何所綑繩索突然鬆散、該人忽滾入江中、王等見狀、即令水手放下舢板將其救起後、再用繩索綑起、後復在各人身上繫一巨石、盛諸蔴袋中、迄船經距海門不遠之三台甲附近、即一一投入江中、令之溺斃、事畢、王等以此事一旦洩漏、爲警局所聞、各人恐難逃法網、</p>
<p>全船員役共簽密約</p>
<p>遂由副買辦陳保生起意、由全體人役訂一密約、嗣後對於此事共守秘密、不論何人、如敢洩漏消息者、定當以處置馬等之法加諸其身、當時王等遂一致贊同、乃拉汽笛一聲、召集輪上所有水手茶役工人廚司等一百餘人、訂立此項密約一紙、並各人在約上簽字蓋章、以昭愼重、</p>
<p>撫卹死者洋二百元</p>
<p>一面撥派向在輪上爲保險等事之施萬金來申、與各被害者家屬接洽、公司方面願以洋二百元送於每一死者之家屬、充作撫卹費、以了此事、施聞命即於本月十七日前往斜橋、先至死者周大通之家中、向周妻周馬氏接洽、並告以周被害之情形、周馬氏突聞此項驚耗、一慟幾絶、</p>
<p>被害家屬報告水警</p>
<p>遂由施再三勸說、令其和平了事、惟周馬氏以乃夫慘遭謀害、豈能以金錢了事、當時虚與敷衍、後即邀同馬扣寳之妻馬陳氏·梅老二之妻梅尤氏·魏金成之妻魏朱氏·孫錫良之妻孫周氏·等、投報上海市公安局水巡隊、請求伸雪、該隊總隊長朱海珊聞報後、以事關重要、立即撥派長警前往方浜路東安里十三號施之家中、將施萬金拘住帶隊、後由施供出、彼輪上目睹馬等被害之一切詳情、隊長以該輪適於日前開往海門、須於前日（十八日）返申、乃於前晚十一時許、派副隊長任潤生·督帶偵緝員楊春庭·嚴復海·陳錫卿·江臨泉·唐錫章·鍾義生·高永泉·蔣伯英·吳劍仁·姚克峻·及警長楊炳奎等、馳往南市十六舖五號碼頭、秘密守候、</p>
<p>三十餘人一併拘獲</p>
<p>未幾見該輪由外馳來、任副隊長等遂不待該輪靠岸、立即用二小汽船旁靠新仁和輪、躍上該輪、凡輪上人役一併搜捕、當將船主孫吉生·買辦郭錫侯·二副王墨清·二領江馮福生·及張寳林·劉庭生·吳瑞生·顧有時·劉毛大·黄福生·石國方·高吉臣·王杏江·葉元富·陳鶴生·沈世忠·陸永廣·馮興發·沈辛郎·沈星喬·王明大·劉永慶·張金才·施多郎·高吉餘·高吉星·張星金·張耀祖·沈瑞豐·袁阿大·黄川·徐廷元·顧金庭·徐大五子·費順華·張小張·周旺明·等水手茶房工人共計三十餘人、併予拘獲、</p>
<p>供認殺害協理主謀</p>
<p>惟協理王冠仙·副買辦陳葆生·大領江陳應龍等、因未在輪上、致未拘獲、當將所獲人犯、一併帶回隊中、由朱總隊長會同副隊長李承華·將所獲人犯逐一帶案、預審之下、各犯對於共同謀害馬扣寳等五人之事、大都供認不諱、惟謀殺主謀則推於協理王冠仙一人身上、訂立密約、則供係二買辦陳葆生所起意、朱李兩隊長、以事關駭人聽聞之大謀殺案、即飭屬將各犯供詞詳細錄下、再令各犯在其供詞上簽字後、備具呈文、一併申解市公安局訊究、</p>

<h3>防止日貨傾銷</h3>
<p>財寳兩部特組委員會</p>
<p>日貨實行傾銷政策後、我國工商業所受影響甚鉅、實業財政兩部、特組傾銷委員會、兹分誌如下、</p>
<p>傾銷政策</p>
<p>日貨自九一八後、因受抵貨影響、銷路阻滯、以致生産過剩、損失甚鉅、乘我國社會經濟於戰後疲敝時候、採用傾銷政策、其傾銷辦法、分一分貨、二跌價、三改牌、四包運、其傾銷貨品、以棉織品煤水泥漁産等爲大宗、火柴紙等次之、</p>
<p>實行以後</p>
<p>日貨傾銷我國之原因、以我國關稅較其他各國低、且運輸便利、日貨之銷路、原以我國爲最大、深恐受抵制後、其他各國外貨輸入、同時日本貨品不能與歐美貨品競爭、不能輸往歐美行銷、特由日本政府補助、利用我國奸商爲之兜銷、自實行之後、我國工商、均受影響、</p>
<p>設法防止</p>
<p>日貨之傾銷者、爲長江沿岸各地、以上海漢口兩埠爲中心、今華商紗廠之减工、水泥造紙漁業之營業不振、均受傾銷之故、實　財政兩部爲防止起見、特組傾銷委員會、查明日貨傾銷之情形、設法制止、以維護我國工商業云、</p>

<p>兩輪互撞</p>
<p>聯興輪載重二千二百噸、於昨日上午七時三十分、裝貨約一千六百噸、由浦東陸家嘴隆茂碼頭啓程、駛往烟台龍口、及至上午八時、駛至英商自來水廠江面、適挪商貨輪奥司利卡號載重約五千噸、正在掉頭停靠碼頭時、兩輪突然互撞、</p>
<p>各受損壞</p>
<p>聯興輪與奥司利卡輪互撞後、聯興輪船頭鐵皮毛釘損壞、奥司利卡輪頭艙旁亦受損壞、但均無大礙、經雙方船主查察後聯興輪停止出口、駛回停泊浦東隆茂碼頭、以便修理、奥司利卡輪停泊東洋碼頭、準備修理、</p>
<p>行將公斷</p>
<p>肇興公司得船主報告後、以奥司利卡輪船身太大、掉頭時周轉呆笨、以致不及讓避而肇禍、應由該輪負責、挪商得船主報告後、以聯興輪見奥司利卡輪掉頭不避免、以致互撞、應由該輪負責、今兩輪各持理由、至於責任問題、將由兩公司請公證人依法公斷、</p>

<p>本館同人，竊凜於對民族生命與文化歷史之責任，兢兢業業，從事於申報者，亦旣六十年矣。廻溯創刊之日，猶在前清同治十一年。其時粵捻之亂甫平，關隴及天山南北路，亦復漸告底定，英人美查氏，來滬經營商業，知日報開風氣之先，且有所獲利也，遂設本館，延蔣芷湘何桂笙錢昕伯王紫詮諸君子，爲主筆政。諸君子一時名下，亦知日報之於文化社會，關係綦鉅，則欣然敝屣榮利，維晨與夕，握槧操鉛，以濟其盛。同時又别刊行叢書，自經史至於說部，凡百六十餘種。　幽握奇，津逮後學。自是而後，業務日張，發行益廣。至於庚子戊戌，國紀不張，外患紛起，人民勵其研精政治之心，以言富强，於是申報之勢力，亦與以俱增。蓋諸先達之致力者，至此益著其成效矣。此後黄君式權金君劍華雷君劍曜陳君景韓張君藴和相繼主持筆政。報館亦於光緒季年，由國人收回自辦。辛亥之役，轉移國運，輿論之力，有足多者。同人所盡之力，固至微細，然亦不敢遽自没其功績也。</p>
<p>至於報紙内容之編制，則尤同人黽勉爲之，日圖進步者。大抵初辦時期，萌藥方新，邸鈔論說新聞消息以外，通信亦不多見。治後論說則力求精警，消息則特約訪員，新聞除臨時發生之事實外，更甄采及於長篇，郵函之不足，復繼之以專電，且由本國以推及外國。而標題之務取醒目，内容之務求充實，與日俱進，亦旣彰彰在人耳目。以證諸六十年來所刊行者，國人應知申報息息負歷史文化之責任，又同時力趨於時代以前，應環境之演化，開風氣於方新，所求不負其使命者，固未嘗一日去諸懷抱也居諸易逝，歲月如流，同人繩前賢之往跡，又參之以新知，風雨燈窗，如斯者六十甲子矣。方其由一年而十年，積漸以往，孜孜求是，初未敢有所陳白於當世。迨至五十年，百歲已半，同人始謀有以紀念本館者，於是有「最近之五十年」之刊行，就世界五十年來學術政治之大端，分别標舉，屬諸專家，以事撰述。假此五十年之紀念，以試行更進一步之工作。</p>
<p>自五十年紀念册之刊行，人手一編，不脛而走。同人因以徵知國人之所需要者，日報以外，正復爲此長篇綂系之撰述。申報旣以促進文化之責自勵，又以順時演進自策，則爲讀者之需要計，寗有故步自封於日報之理？於是同人乃益相督責，期復竭其知能，盡其責任於日報之外矣。</p>
<p>荏苒者瞬息十稔。今兹申報，乃已度其六十周年。於此六旬之際，以業務言，繩繩業業，固可舉杯酌以展慶典；就責任言，同人雖晨夕不敢自懈，固尚以日報之外，未能多印旁通之刊物爲憾事。况客年九一八之變，舉世方謀救東北以救國者，國土淪胥之痛，人民流離之慘，弔尚不暇，慶之謂何？申報同人，感觸維殷，激厲以起，乃益謀事業之發展，以紀念此六十之周年。屏除彩觴徵逐之習俗，而加重其自身應盡之責任。本來救國難，策危亡，當自人人能盡其責任始，同人廢虚榮以尚實務，當爲世人所樂聞者歟？外覘時代之需要，内課本身之使命，再接再厲，以從其後，於是本年先有月刊之發行。月刊者，多載有綂系之長篇著作，足以供一般人之研究，蓋幾於文化所包含之科學藝術，無不畢賅。而其記事之部分，亦有類於史部之月表。</p>
<p>自綂計之學昌明，綂計之術精進，人羣進化之事，社會變遷之跡，可藉數字表格，以見其眞實之面目。西諺有云：「數字不造誑語，」綂計之足徵，蓋駕文字紀載而上之也。結集各種綂計，以供按索，爲年鑑之職責。因之，本館於日報月刊之外，乃復有年鑑之編輯。以月刊輔日報，乃又益之以年鑑，俾日報月刊爲經，年鑑爲緯。論時治史者得日報爲之備載無遺，月刊爲之徵引提舉，而年鑑之綂計史表，則又足以包舉日報月刊而增補其未能詳於旦夕經月之間者。合三事錯綜以觀之，庶足無掛漏之虞，繁瑣之患乎？</p>
<p>論時治史，貴聞見之能眞切，考訂之能詳審。夫以一人而窮治現代史，其能力視報館之自通都至於邊鄙，通信網遍布者爲何如？其材料視報館蒐集搜羅之勤至者，又爲何如？固不待詞費而獲解也。今同人從事於日報者六十年，首尾銜替，乃進以求諸旁通之史表紀事，若月刊、若年鑑者，參綜以觀，思過其半。同人固不敢遽以此自滿，然自信其能以一完全之通史，供當世之需要。自今以前，日報負直系通史之任務，固已卓然獨具其價值；自今以往，即旁通者亦計年以授梓。史事史鑑，兼顧並彰，蔚然鉅製，汗簡足徵矣。</p>
<p>同人盡瘁於日報，今又見月刊以至於年鑑之先後刊行告成，理想之實現，已開其端，固足自相慰藉；然同人之所以希望於讀者者，正方興而未艾也。同人深知民族生命之繫於文化，文化之傳後無窮者爲歷史。然撰述歷史爲一事，由歷史以致用爲一事。人類進化，非識其故，曷圖其新？以古爲鑑，俾知得失，此歷史之效用也。同人旣盡其應有之職責，乃不能不進而企諸致用之讀者矣。</p>
<p>方今世變正亟，非獨我中國之日處阽危，急於求治也；卽全世界亦無不在飄搖風雨之中，不遑寗處。夫人羣以求幸福爲歸宿，而今兹大亂方興，去幸福之塗日遠。其政治之不臧歟？其經濟之不節歟？其敎化之失修歟？其制度之不善歟？有志於謀人羣之幸福者，於此急起研索，未可更晚也。求治者以史爲鑑，同人則以史自役，容有貢獻之處，用爲嚆矢之資，則他年以文化之貽留，史事之鑑戒，俾撥亂而返治，　　醫藥界</p>

<h3>申報年鑑序</h3>
<p>張·藴·和·</p>
<p>年鑑占世界各國出版界之重要位置。自世界文明日進而後，事態之變化日繁，一切政敎工商經濟社會種種事業之進展，亦一日千里。非有年鑑，無以資逐年之比較；亦非有年鑑，無以供平常日用之參考；故年鑑爲各界人上所必需，已甚明顯。本館總理史君量才之言曰：「日報者，以一日之所得供給於讀者者也；月刊者，積一月之所得以供給於讀者者也。然一日之所得無幾。卽積至一月，雖較可加以正確之觀察，作有系綂之紀述，但事態之遞邅，瞬息萬變，一月之所得，仍覺其片段不全。人縱有極强之記憶力，亦安能將一年來之千千萬萬事事物物，藏於腦經，貫通融會而永久不忘？年鑑者，卽將此一千之所得，爲之爬梳清理，以代各界人士於腦經中記此不能記之事物，留此不能留之印像者也。然則年鑑之作，又烏能以已？」同人皆曰善。於是乃聘張梓生君經理其事。張君本積學之士，材識精細。又得財政經濟專家孫懷仁，政治法律專家章倬漢諸君襄助之。鳩工庀材，開始於去年七月。經十閱月之黽勉從事，再三審愼，而始底於成。張君梓生之言曰：「此事有數困難：經營草創，難期完備，一也：材料來源不同，每相矛盾，綂計數字，尤難正確，二也；篇幅有限，事態無窮，旣恐過繁，又懼遺漏，三也；世界經濟，浩無涯岸，附帶撮述，抉擇尤難，四也；世事變化，莫可捉摸，朝甫草就，暮成過去，五也。因此數者，是以已調查者每加覆查，已審定者再經改易，此時期之所以不免稍延也」。張君言此，并表示其歉然不自滿足之意，然亦可見其用意之誠，與辦事之劬矣。夫此書之作，非徒以省記憶，便閱覽而已；實與國家社會有絶大之關係。我國之政治軍事工商敎育學術以及交通社會等等，其進步與衰退，固皆與我國人民痛癢相關，而經濟尤爲現代生活之中心。世界列强經濟狀况，更與我國息息相通。張君特别注重於此，勤加搜輯，得使讀者知此中盈虚消長，謀所以生存於此世界之道，進而求所以改進自强之方，則此書之爲人人所需要可知；而於國家社會，亦可謂不無小補矣。故僕樂述其緣起，以誌史總理用意之殷與張君任事之勇。至於本書體例之是否周備，採輯之是否精審，自有讀者諸君批評，可勿贅。是役，負分編及簽校採訪等責者有唐公憲君，陳賡雅君，金澍人君，黄寄萍君，方子川君。而宗幼澤，蔣鎭兩君，未及卒事，卽有他就以去。特約撰稿者，陳文鷺君，吳菱丹君（一年來之國難），蔣堅忍君，郭力三君，張柳雲君（空軍），王德發君，（水産業），劉士木君（僑務），房動安君，王維騏君（勞動），吳覺農君（農村及合作事業），徐壽齡君（南京市），蕭勃君（漢口市），徐調孚君（出版），李繼之君（考古學），唐敬杲君，金仲華君，伍遷耀君，吳杜若君（世界），黄幼雄君（諾貝爾奬金及度量衡幣表）等十九人；黨務建設兩篇，則全採用崔唯吾曾養甫兩君所供給之材料。綜計執筆從事者，凡三十有一人。</p>

<h3>鐵展與國貨</h3>
<p>— 仰菲</p>
<p>鐵道部爲喚起國人注意提倡國貨銷塲，發展國民經濟，增進鐵路運輸，助長農商發達，調劑供求平衡起見。於四月十日起至三十日在上海金神父路南首愛麥虞限路中華學藝社舉行全國鐵路沿線出産貨品展覽會，徵集各路沿線及各大商埠各大都市出産貨品，並繪製各種圖表，表示産銷運輸狀况，蓋欲求鐵路貨運業務之進展，須謀沿線農工商業之發達，而農工商業之發達，亦非賴鐵路運輸之進展不可，當謂農工爲貨物之生産者，商賈爲貨物之貿遷者，鐵路爲貨物之運輸者，之三者皆與物産品質之改良，數量之增加，運轉之靈活，銷路之擴充，有切身之利害，有縝密之關係，顧在平日生産販賣運輸三者，往往無共同探討之方，即無協力改良之法，彼此之困難無由諒解，彼此之合作未能實現，隔閡生而痛苦隨之，實爲國貨事業前途之一大障礙。今鐵道部能集各路沿線佩物産於一地，並集生産販賣運輸三者於一堂，其用意之深，設計之密，至可敬。記者參觀一周，尚病徵集未盡溥遍，出品未盡完備，顧管中窺豹，已可見其一斑。會中所列農産品，似以津浦線爲多，特産品以北寗路居首，工藝品以滬寗滬杭爲著，礦産林木以平綏平漢爲主，隴海猶多未盡開發，膠濟亦覺未盡發揮、所繪各路出産及運輸諸國，已能見其大概，瞭如指掌。惟管見所及，有下列數點，似應切實注意，庶於發展國貨前途，克收實效焉。</p>
<p>一各路沿線原料，極多價值低廉，大可供工業界之需求，乃以運輸機關組織未備，旣無寛大之貨棧，又乏特種之車輛，乃至裝卸之機輛，完備之車塲，以及碼頭輪渡駁船等之大量設備，爲貨運上必要之工具，大都缺如。生産界雖欲以原料運往各地，而有志莫遂，致供者無法供應，求者無從購致，國貨前途，影響甚巨，此則各路非急急改良運輸上之設備不可。</p>
<p>二各路沿線旣富農産，又多工業品，而以前鐵路當局在未有負責運輸以前，對於業務方面，漫不注意，旣無冷藏以儲鮮貨，又無通風保暖之法，一任貨物腐壞，一切貨物，旣不備車接送，又不聯絡運輸，運價之參差不一，寄貨之手續麻煩，站員則重重留難，路工復任意需索，病農病工病商，在在足以阻碍國貨之發展，此則各路非急急改良運輸上之管理，與整頓路上職工之風紀，改革一切服役者之惡習不可。</p>
<p>三各路沿線出産品，精美者固多，而因陋就簡者不少。大都以生産技術之落後，促其衰敗，如生絲品質之不齊，茶葉製法之日窳，浙江蠶種之退化，江西瓷業之凋零，均爲生産界之病徵。欲求發展，一面固須各方努力協助，促其進展。一面全在力求生産方法之技術化，俾能大量生産，抵　舶來。我國貨同業可倖存於外貨充斥之市塲，至販賣方面，因賴運輸之改進，而又須厚集力量，使販賣集中化合作化，集中則能力厚，合作則耗費减，此於國貨進展上大有助力，非賴工商兩界之通力合作不可。</p>
<p>國貨談話</p>
<h3>管理制度與國貨運動（上）</h3>
<p>— 谷園</p>
<p>工業革命後，歐美各國的工業制度，變家庭爲工廠，形式内容，都起了很大的變化。管理方法，由單純而複雜，爲適應環境的需要，經過長期的研求改進，已達到科學化的地步。降至近今，演進而爲産業合理化，凡是工廠的管理，都有縝密的設計和詳細的方法，不論一舉一動，不能離越軌道一步，對於增加生産，提高生活標準，在歐美日本，確具有相當的成效。</p>
<p>我國的國民性，素以保守著稱，處事隨便，遠不及西洋人的緊張周密，數千年來，墨守手工業制度，不思改進，迨至海通以後，受西洋文明的激盪，一切舊法，自難與進步的工業制度相抗衡。稍識時務者，覺悟到非步武歐美，改良制度，不足以國存，於是數年來提倡工商業的結果，管理制度，也漸爲一般人所注意了。最近，更受歐美各國産業合理化運動的影響，國人對於管理制度的研求推進，更是不遺餘力，有工商管理協會等的組織，其他類似的團體，和各商業機關内部的管理研究會等，比比皆是。影響所及，對於生産效能的增進，確有效果，以致工廠商店改用新式管理制度的，日漸衆多，尤其是會計制度的革新，更爲明顯。這種趨勢，只要看年來會計師事業的發達，就可反映出來。</p>
<p>有些人以爲我國工商管理的進步，如歐美日本一樣，除助長失業我們暫作别論外，似乎找不出可以反對的理由。但我們要知道，歐美日本管理方法的進步，各方面都能適應新的環境，每事每物，無不求之自已；所以制度的革新，一切都跟着進步，這樣才能獲得全部的利益，没有絲毫的弊病，回顧我國，社會的底層，尚保持着古代的形態，一方面因爲要仿效西洋化，硬把西洋的管理制度，生吞活剝地搬了過來，在表面上，似乎制度已有相當的革新，但是把制度和社會環境互相對比，就可以顯出很大的不稱，最顯明的現象，即管理制度的洋化，足以增進貿易的入超。</p>
<h3>國貨公司的禮讚</h3>
<p>— 吟閣</p>
<p>吟閣住在内地，聽得上海開了國貨公司，地點在南京路大陸商塲。馬上搭火車到申，專誠前往瞻仰瞻仰。到了公司仔細一看。一切吃的，穿的，用的東西，件件都有。不但是中國的製造事業，覺得顯然有進步。并且在上海純粹出售國貨的百貨商店這個公司的確是第一家，所以一走進公司就覺得非常愉快。　　在民國十九年吟閣在日本東京曾作一個月的勾留，東京幾個百貨商店，如松阪屋，三越吳服店，白木屋等，都去逛逛。覺得他們有一件畏處，就是樓上樓下，各部分所售貨物，綂綂是日本貨。就是他們的國貨。吾們上海的百貨公司規模果然不小，貨物亦極華麗佳妙。所可惜者，不能像東京各店的件件是國貨。</p>
<p>好了。現在竟有件件是國貨的百貨公司。這豈不是上海市塲最值得禮讚的事麽。</p>
<p>國貨討論</p>
<h3>整理各地土産</h3>
<p>— 天然</p>
<p>從這次參加芝博預展會所得的印象，就是土産的質量比新興的工業多，足見中國生産界的前途，并未達到極發達的階段。而且，這所謂參加展覽的土産，仍多是業經改良過的，其餘被人遺忘的尚不知凡幾。於此，我們不得不提出整理各地土産之口號。</p>
<p>我們自然不希望做古董販子，但是中國各地的特産，有許多不獨能在國内市塲佔有地位，且有推廣到世界市塲之可能，却因爲經濟和技術的關係，竟因式微而漸消滅。這許多被人遺忘的國貨，有的很合實用，在式微消滅的時候，我們時常因不知有國貨而用外貨，還以爲没有代用品而自作解釋，這又是如何的傷心！關於技術方面，江西夏布和瓷器都給予我們事實的證明，整理固有的事業，比較創設新事業總要便宜些，我們的企業家，又何必任其利棄於地袖手旁觀呢！</p>
<p>自經濟學上解釋，向内地去整理土産，比在城市開設小規模的工廠還要有把握。房屋生財原料工資一切都比都市便宜，而對於當地經濟的調劑，更有若干的助力。在管理，廠屋建造，衛生設備各方面，比在都市中更有設計研究的機會，不因環境而限制。即是退一步講，於整理的過程中，就是没有明顯的成功和進步，和往昔一般的生産品，仍舊有相當的銷場，所以這不能稱爲冒險事業。</p>
<p>因爲内地農業經濟的破産，關於副業的提倡和金融的調劑有極大的需要，到内地去整理土産，一方面可以容納了都市剩滯的資金，對於内地更有極大的助力。可是，這對於都市不是毫無利益的，增加了内地的購買力，減少了畸形的集中都市之移民趨勢，對於整個的國家經濟且有極大的好處呢！</p>
<p>所以，我們希望有志的生産家，莫忘記了整理各地土産。一般國貨公司更應儘量的利用土産，推銷土産。</p>
<h3>責任</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>許多人在集議着，甲說：「東北現在差不多完全失陷了，在這樣危急存亡之秋，我們一般民衆，應當怎樣纔好！」乙說：「誠然的，這樣的下去，我們不抵抗，他們日日攻，弄倒後來，我們的各要口，都要被他們所蹂躪吃。到那時候，再要想法子，恐怕是萬萬來不及了！」丙說：「二位所說的話，我倒有一個　喻，中國好似一枚橘子，圓圓滿滿，本來生得很好看，無如一旦壞了一點點我們似乎不看見，把它忽略了，後來那一點的壞處，慢慢的延大了，到這時候，已經吃不得了；也就是中國在那小小的被侵略的時候，不知道起來想法子，將來弄到敵跡滿了全國，那纔眞和那壞了的橘子一樣了·」丁說：「丙君的話，說得很透澈但是中國現在和壞橘子的程度比較起來，已達入半壞時期，所以如再不大家起來，亟謀挽救，這大可說一聲（完了）呢！」戊說：一諸君的　論，我已飽聆，我以爲像我們的一班人，旣不能執干拿戈，又不能打槍射箭，却祗可做一些後方的重要工作！」「：：：」</p>
<p>我聽了許多人的集議，大都是很愛國的言論，歸納他們幾個人的話，離不了「責任」二字。我想在世界上做一個人，可說是無論是誰，都離不了「責任」二字。假使有個没有責任的人，那人纔是失去了生命的死人，而不是會說話的活人！</p>
<p>小孩的責任是讀書，婦人的責任是對於家庭内的一切，男人的責任是關於自身的職務：：：，但是當今初要的重大責任，不是無論誰分别負担，却是要全國民衆，一起要把這個重大責任負担起來，這纔能夠完成他的偉大工作。　　「一個國家的生産，是供給一國人民的需求·」這是我老早說過。也祗有我們中國人肯　了自已的精華，而去用外人的　粕。這樣由淺入深，相恃了幾十年，中國人的腦海中，把外貨占據了大部分，而國貨呢？在他們的腦海中，尤其是一般自稱摩登化的中心人物，我想連一些影踪也没有。一天，我在中國國貨公司的電料部，看見一對自以爲摩登的夫婦，那女的指着那掛着的吊燈說：「這明明是外國貨，中國人那裏會做這樣的吊燈呢！那男的笑着說：「中國人如果會做這樣地吊燈，早已强了，也不會給日本這樣侮辱了！那女的嘻開了嘴地走開了！</p>
<p>啊啊！好大胆的一個中國人啊！你竟這樣瞧不起中國人！說那美國的吊燈是外國貨，你從那裏看出它是外國貨。在這裏，我又要提起：「責任」二字來了，這是說話的責任，你說這樣的話，你也曾想到中國的工業，現在雖未能說是勃興時代，然而萌芽是代，是無論誰都承認，在萌芽時代的中國工業，我們中國人，都有園丁的資格，竭力的培護它還來不及，你却要這樣無端地加以摧殘。要知道像你這般地無的放矢，在你自已，不過是一句話；在那出品者聽見了，心裏是如何的悲痛啊！那麽我們可以知道，就是說一句話的微小，也要把責任負起來！</p>
<p>中國人的喜歡用外國貨，在有悠久的歷史下的今日，可說是：「世襲主義，」假使說，以前祖父的一件　綢袍子，穿得不要了，把兒子穿，兒子穿得不要了，改小了把孫子穿；現在是更變了花樣，以前的是中國貨，現在却用外國貨在那裏嬗遞了！</p>
<p>現在的中國人，是應當負起你們自已的責任的時候了！現在不比從前，中國的科學進步了，工業進步了，以至一切，都有長足的進展。人生的衣食住行四大需要，都有國貨可以供給。一般喜歡用外國貨的中國人把你們的責任轉一個向，因爲你們買外國貨化錢，買中國貨也不過是化錢；買外國貨化的錢多，買中國貨化的銀少；買外國貨化了多的錢去孝敬外國人，買中國貨化了少的錢來利濟民生。非但這樣，而且重大的責任，可以完全負起，由近及遠，可以把行將沈淪的整個民族，挽救起來！也就是把前面許多人的集議，得到一個良好的結果。</p>
<p>凡是中國人，亟應明瞭當前的責任，是怎麽一回事！但是再不可在今後把這個重大的責任，棄諸腦後，而依然故我的：「諮批評，不力行！」</p>
<h3>上海之化妝品工業</h3>
<p>— 松廬</p>
<p>時代的鉅輪不住的推進着，社會上的一切事物，都起了突飛孟晋的銳變尤其是工業上的新陳代榭，有顯著的變革，卽以化妝品工業而論，二十年來，因爲外貨在華的傾銷，抵制風潮的迭起，國民愛國思想的膨脹，與夫化學技術的演進，單就上海一埠，化妝品工廠蓬勃興起，先後創立者，不下五六十漲，迄乎最近，化妝品在上海一埠産銷，全年已達八百萬元，那些舊時的臙脂宮粉，固然隨着時代的淘汰，營業一落千丈，而日貨在華的傾銷，終於也給國人的努力和奮鬬，而使它在我國市上，無從立足，據去年上海化妝品同業公會的調查：日貨化妝品在華銷額，僅占我全國銷額百分之一，這一點也聊堪爲提倡國貨所努力的自慰，並愈增我們對於「工業救國」的熱烈期望。</p>
<p>化妝品新工業，在中國是還不到三十年的歷史，最初創設的，是香港廣生行，所出的雙妺嚜花露水，也曾風行過一時；在上海最先創設的，是中國化學工業社，該社所出的三星牌牙膏，年銷數十萬元，不特爲國貨中最優良的潔齒劑，並且也賴此抵制了不少外貨侵略，爲國家挽回一部份權利。家庭工業社以小規模起業，發行無敵牌紙包牙粉，當五四風潮激蕩的時候，該社便利用這個時機，積極宣傳，不數年，便取日貨金剛石獅子牌的地位而代之。永和實業公司，雖没有鉅大的規劃，但因爲出品的衆多，推銷的得法，在國産化妝品工業中，也有了相當的地位。此外以藥房業而兼營化妝品者，如大陸藥房的雅霜，中西藥房的明星花露水，中法藥房的孩兒面，銷暢也都不惡。其餘那些小規模工廠，不下餘數十家，資本自五千元起至二三萬元不等，全年的營業額，約自一萬元起至七八萬元，出品種類，最普銷者，是雪花膏，花露水，生髮水，牙粉，牙膏，及蜜膠，撲粉等。</p>
<p>與化妝品有連帶關係的，尚有香皂，香皂，雖不是化妝品，但也是漱洗必具之物，論起</p>

<p>它的功用，是與牙膏牙粉具有同一意義。所以比較規模較大的化妝品工廠，也都附屬製皂，如：中國化學工業社，廣生行，永和實業公司等，每年香皂的銷額，爲數亦頗可觀。至於專製肥皂的工廠，則有華豐製皂廠，中央香皂廠，愛華香皂廠，中華興記廠等，而華豐中央兩皂廠，營業尤鉅，每年的銷額，總在二三十萬元以上。</p>
<p>近年來，國人的奢侈程度，恰與生活的增高成一正比例，尤其是一般摩登女性們，迷信外貨的心理特深，所以高貴的西洋化妝品，在華銷額爲數着實可驚，國貨商爲謀抵制起見，乃不得不把裝璜力事模仿得與外貨近似，甚至有許多國貨化妝品，將華文完全删除，招貼上滿紙的洋文，有些更將名稱，題得與西洋譯名相似，然而結果，雖可得一部份人的歡迎，而那些窮極奢侈品的摩登女子，則仍非十餘元一瓶的法國香水不辦，「哀莫大於心死」！這樣的媚外心理，又如何使國貨商不感着重大的打擊。</p>
<p>至於日本貨在華的銷額，據上海化妝品同業公會的調查，每年僅有三十四萬元的銷額，其出品以太陽堂的雙美人牌，及由大版運華的七星牌蜜糖膏爲最多，此外小林商店的獅子牌牙粉牙膏，在中國的銷路，也没有完全絶跡。這一點，仍希望國貨廠家的繼續努力！</p>
<h3>消費中的生産</h3>
<p>— 鳴鳳</p>
<p>吾們要盡一分子的責任，對於社會，對於國事，可以問心無愧，至少應當替公衆做一些有益的工作，這所謂有益的工作，果然包括甚廣。然最好的工作，就是生産上的工作。譬如種田製物都是有生産的工作。</p>
<p>上面所說的是「以生産爲生産」現在要講消費中的生産。一個人到消費的時候，還有什麽生産可說。不知消費的時候，無論是吃，是着，是用。但能吃本國貨，着本國貨，用本國貨。那麽本國的生産事業因銷路增廣自然一天天發達起來。如果吃的着的用的都是外國貨，那麽外國的生産事業果然因吾人愛用來頭貨而日益發達，而本國的生産事業則因銷路日少而一天天萎縮起來了。所以消費的時候能消費本國貨。這消費就是生産。</p>
<h3>我與國貨</h3>
<p>— 浦曼彬</p>
<p>送禮問題　吾家最繁複的要算送禮問題，紅白帖子，天天不斷，婚嫁呀，喪葬呀，慶壽呀，生兒滿月呀，周歲呀，喬遷呀，開幕呀，乃至陰壽做功德等，人家恭恭敬敬的發一份帖子來，除掉無心的忘掉以後，那裏可以置之不睬。外子做詩撰聯，也是早上工作之一，「秀才人情紙半張」，所費雖省，但每月對聯立軸，也要費三四十元。當初家庭日新會中，沈信卿黄任之諸位先生，曾提議節省送禮辦法，有除特别交情外，普通至多以一元爲度之議。後來王志莘先生復提議另外專印一種禮劵，爲本會會員使用，都是俗奢示儉之意。現在我想大家正在提倡國貨時代，送禮最好的辦法，無過於贈送國貨。可是國貨種類太多，各人嗜好不一，萬一我虔虔誠誠送人一件禮物，他偏偏没有用處，當然是不惹人家喜歡了。况且糖菓糕餅，容易腐壞，日子久了，便没用處。外子曾與胥仰南先生商量以國貨布疋裝成禮盒，作爲餽贈之品，很有價值。聽說胥君已經實行，可是最適宜的，莫過於國貨禮劵，可以取貨，可以兌銀，任人方便，我們實行以來，覺得於已於人，都感實惠。我上次在家庭日新會中已遍告親友，都來試辦，這也是我婦女們提倡國貨的小責任。</p>
<p>奸商可殺　一天我領了小孩，無意中走過法租界某商店，進去看看，忽然看見某夥友正在把一疋劣貨，用偷天換日的手段，揭去日本牌子，改用國貨牌號，抬頭看見了我，馬上收好，面上似乎有難爲情的樣子，大約是良心發現。我歎了口氣，對他說，我知道了，勸你們激發天良，爲國人稍留人格。　實是對牛彈琴，這種混帳的奸商，那裏談得到愛國不愛國，夥友固不好，實在也可憐，吃老闆飯不得不如此，最可惡而罪該萬死者，是十惡不赦的老闆。</p>
<p>可敬的夥友　吾回到家中，外子說，今天有某洋布店的夥友，特地來說，他店裏專販劣貨，專把劣貨招牌，換那國貨牌子，我今天做這種事，於心不忍，所以忍痛告辭，這夥友頗有餓死事小失節事大的氣慨，我們爲之十分起敬　　小皮球案　我家阿維，他是最喜玩皮球的。一天看見報上有「小皮球是日貨」一則，他馬上寫了一封信給小記者先生，要請這位投稿者把這家市塲，不客氣的檢舉出來，阿銓說她多事，阿維說，這是小朋友在國貨年應有的責任</p>
<h3>國貨家庭</h3>
<p>— 治成</p>
<p>什麽是足以稱揚贊美的模範家庭？</p>
<p>這當然是多方面的，如夫婦和睦，家庭經濟狀况良好，以及清潔識字等等，但是，我們要認定必須是一個國貨家庭。</p>
<p>因爲用舶來品的人家，對於本身最要緊的民族觀念還未　清，對於國民經濟仍是漠不關心，如果竟崇拜外貨而忽視國貨，簡直是可以詬駡的家庭，那裏足以做我們的模範？</p>
<p>所謂舶來品，假如足以代表摩登或是潔亮的話，同時也足以表示奢華的意思；模範家庭必定是要提倡節約的，當然以用國貨爲最宜，當然是國貨公司的老主顧，所以，祇有國貨家庭才配稱模範家庭。</p>
<p>模範家庭的主婦，必是一個賢明而多才的人，事事需有條有理，物物應有相當計算，如果一味的崇拜外貨，如果不明白國貨代用品的處置，如果毫没有對國貨堅强的信仰，那裏能建樹一個足以楷模的模範家庭！</p>
<p>對於模範家庭的兒童，我多希望他們能做新時代的主人翁，爲着他們堅强的自信以及民族意識的覺悟，我們更要建立一個國貨家庭，以作良好的敎育環境。</p>
<p>自然，誰都希望自已樹一個模範家庭，誰都能夠努力建立一個模範家庭，但是，我們認定牠必需還是一個國貨家庭。</p>
<h3>工廠的健全問題</h3>
<p>— 許難公</p>
<p>：：：：：：：：：</p>
<p>當斯國貨運動熱烈聲中，果然需要激勵民衆，一致倡導愛護服用，使國貨普遍市塲，深入内地城鎭。但我們要使用國貨基礎穩固，源源不絶地産生，這有賴於製造工廠本身的健全。健全的工廠，才有優越的出品，精美的貨品，方能廣大的推銷，此爲自然之定理，所以我們要振興國貨須求工廠的健全和穩固。</p>
<p>所謂健全穩固，不僅是資本的大小，産量的多寡爲定例，資本的充裕果爲一廠之首要，但主事者須具運用能力，善爲調度，亦爲成功要素。反是雖擁巨量資金而乏運用能力，也未必定能成功。至於出品方面，徒取量之多而不求質的精，粗製濫造，結果勢必失却受用者的信仰。所以我們謂健全者不限於此，是要組織管理的嚴密，設備計算的週到準確，尤須有深刻的觀察。</p>
<p>凡一廠行政和辦事的便利，須賴於完密的組織，合法的管理，否則工作散漫，毫無頭緒，以致遇事互相推諉，負責乏人，此種情形，豈能有美滿之成績。所以一廠的事務須由工作性質的不同而加以區别，分部設科專司其事，則事無巨細各有專職，因部份之紛繁而尤須有合法的管理，工作的勤惰，出品的優劣，全在於管理的合法而予以奬罰，因此一廠秩序安定，紀律嚴明，事業的發展，也隨之而興。</p>
<p>關於工作效率的增加，須先設備週到，例如清潔衛生，安全設施，以及食宿等等的便利，使職工生活安定，靜心服務工作興奮，效率亦因之增加，成本欲求低輕，則有賴於準確的計算，如原料採購，人工分配等等。某種原料應增應减，某一部份須得若干人工，使一事一物不致頓積缺少，或過忙過閒，興利革弊，分配平均，節制糜費，則成本爲之低廉，出品亦易銷售。</p>
<p>同時一廠的主事者須具靈敏的思想，遠大的眼光，默察社會需要，熟諳市塲情形，則不致眛然將不合社會心理和需要的貨品而製造。因物質的享受隨時代潮流之變遷而異，所以須適合社會心理而加以改進，則貨物不致呆滯而易流動。</p>
<p>以上所述，僅就内部設施的梗概，其他關於出品及業務方面，因篇幅有限，續再討論之。</p>
<h3>女學生與國貨</h3>
<p>— 小娜女士</p>
<p>在學校理，我們可以看到一般的女同學們，她們所穿的，用的，和一切的物品，什麽都是舶來品，不是美國貨，就是法國貨，或許是英國貨，日本貨，總之，找不出本國貨的，</p>
<p>但是話要說回來了，現在已有好幾處學校，是通令禁購舶來品，而須用國貨了！但是始終是不澈底的，是官樣的，不信，在星期日或許是假日，學校區一帶，你照舊可以看到，她們着了喬其紗，印度綢一類的衣服，肉色的絲襪，高跟的皮鞋，臉上還得塗脂抹粉，走起路來，嫋嫋嬝嬝，活像妓女一般，在她們的心理，以爲不是這樣，便引不上人家的注意，不用舶來品便不能顯出學生的高貴！</p>
<p>唉！學生是有智識的階級啊！是將來中國的主人翁啊！女學生未嘗不是呢？她們不知道華北的事麽？不知道國難的日亟麽？不知道帝國主義對我經濟壓迫的危險麽？她們不知道自已應盡的責任麽？我想，總該知道吧！自然，她們應該立即起來執行救國的任務！</p>
<p>救國的任務者何？無他，棄却了舶來品的服飾，抛掉了脂粉等的消耗品，把國貨提倡起來！用智識階級的立塲來勸導一般婦女，購用國貨，一方面仍須致力於學術的精進，那才是女學生應有的表現！</p>
<p>新工業介紹</p>
<h3>值得介紹的一種國貨</h3>
<p>— 懷</p>
<p>憶自民元。政府下令剪髮。迄已二十二載。理髮所用軋刀。素無國産。且歷來行銷於市塲者。悉係漢和洋行出售之日貨。因白色人種髮質較爲細軟。歐美所製軋刀。均有二十五齒。不合於我國人之應用。綂計上年是項進口之日貨。竟達二百四十萬之鉅。兹有利鋒軋髮刀剪廠。費數年之研究。精工製造。已得優良之成績。經各大理髮室試用。均稱滿意。刀爲十五齒。其刀背略成灣形。軋髮長短。能隨心所欲。其售價則較日貨爲廉。業經正式出貨。以利字爲商標。工廠設於本埠勞勃生路致和里。想將來該廠出品。必能暢銷全國。亦提倡國貨聲中之好消息也。</p>
<p>參觀筆記</p>
<h3>交大工展中陳列之國貨</h3>
<p>— 枕木</p>
<p>誠然，在此次的展覽會中，國貨工業的陳列品，没有舶來品那麽的多，那樣的好；但是在國貨質和量方面，也給與了觀衆以相當的認識，曉得許多洋貨的日用品，現在也有國人自製的出産來代替，記者爰爲介紹。</p>
<p>電池之應用也，無論收音發音，以及一切有無線之電報電話電鈴等機件，此物爲必不可少；電池之類别有乾有濕，更有蓄電之池，花式繁多。查電池本爲洋貨，年來國人亦能自製，陳列中有譚泮，勝舶及建華三家之蓄電池，頗爲考究，而所用之鉛版與酸液，配合亦甚精密，較之舶來品，並不差次，據云交通部電局現亦裝製譚泮電池以代外貨矣。</p>
<p>磗瓦爲泥土受熱而成，有紅有青，視其火侯而定，有乳白，有蛋黄，視其質料而異，式樣尺寸則隨模型而不同；陳列廠家，計有泰山的紅青磗瓦，益中的花色磁面磗，此號磁磗之花式圖案，可由用者自已擬定，預爲配製。</p>
<p>油漆入口，年耗數百萬，爲國人應起而謀挽回之急務；其原料以動植物油，石粉，脂肪，爲主，而另加各種金屬粉及顏料，以資配色，會中除該校研究所之油漆廠公開表演外，尚有振華之飛虎牌雙旗牌，元豐之豐字牌等陳列，均屬上選。</p>
<p>圓釘，小物也，然亦來自外洋，年溢現金不少，現有公勤鐵工廠及中國製釘公司兩家，在會塲公開表演製釘技術：其機器，共分三具，爲馬達，盤車及截釘機；盤車上盤置元鐵鐵絲，粗細隨意，馬達扳動，鐵絲前進，入截釘機内，工作三動，而一釘出，計爲一撞成扁圓之頭，一軋成尖銳之尾，一擊而釘與機離。該機工作之速率，以記者估計，吋把小釘，每分鐘可出八九十只。</p>
<p>除上述種種外，尚有中華鐵工廠之離心力抽水機，面盆製肧機，此製肧機之工作，係以圓形鐵皮，衝撞成模式毛肧，據記者憑脈膊計算結果，每分鐘約可壓出毛肧七八具。亞光廠之電木，電木本非木質，實爲有機物質的混合品，其用途以製造電氣用具，兒童玩物，日用品，自來水筆桿等，頗爲廣寛闊。蓋其特點在乎不傳電，不傳熱，敲不碎，跌不破，而其壞處則一遇火星，即被燒化；此物以外貨居多，今有國産，願國人用之。及中新工廠之經濟油爐，小者高五六寸，大者不到一市尺，均分三部，爲脚床，燈帶，及上體，以火油作燃料，不須打氣，一點就着，携帶便利，消耗經濟，據云：火油三兩，可燃燒一小時之久。</p>
<p>此外則震旦之藥沬滅火機。新中工程公司之馬達，發電機，引擎，抽水機。華生電廠之各式電扇；民生工廠之汽車，順昌公司之石粉；中國公司之水泥；標準公司之奬牌；大中華之橡膠用具；三星，華南之化裝品；中華，中一之文具；鑄亞鐵廠之紡織機；利昌工廠之提線羅紋針織機；以及遠大鐵工廠之壓路機，電氣風箱，及交通車輛等。均爲國人之精製，足見吾國現代工業品之一般。</p>

<p>糧食　河下米定中帶軟</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日來源三四十號、但連日天雨、本街作客寥寥、因此初市呈疲、後市雖見帶堅、市况未免垂軟、故經售方扳堅、卒不能挽回頽勢、遂成定中帶軟之象、蘇同粳及南港厚稻價小數分、包胃續爲南洋·汕頭帮辦去千包、北洋·烟台帮採取四五百包、然形勢已不若前日之緊、青角帮松江等薄稻市價仍爲站定、至若西練塘貨以俱屬零胃、價格跟跌角許、杜洋尖平穩、陰元堅定而已、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源念三四號、白粳走化、雖天雨綿綿、胃溶尚稱不惡、市形高定次稍帶緊扣、薄粳早稻到消兩和、價亦挺立、秈米定立、白元緊近角、</p>
<p>西貢米跌價動銷</p>
<p>昨日洋米市况、轉見活動、因漢口退申之小絞、曾以低價售出後、本街頗有辦意、昨日又開一百包、價仍至七元三角半、西貢米之貸主鑒於小絞　價動銷、出意亦爲活動、隨將日前價開八元以上之一號西貢　高貸再爲貶小一角、兩天小去二角、只售七元八角、乃引起本市南北米號與鄉莊之問津、綂市成交三千包、價雖見小、市面則已活潑、閩帮對於客秈去胃、亦甚貪辦、市價似有步砌之望、惟湘贛兩客鑒於滬上閩胃甚旺、紛電該地將以前講存之貨裝申、故販户雖然停止辦裝、到頭反見整數抵埠、昨日又有湘贛米六千包到申、隨市由閩客辦去湘南機油米五百五十包、價八元三角二分至八元二角八分、又糙紅五百四十包、價六元九角至六元八角六分、江西機晚一千包、價八元零四分、七元七角、次至七元三角七分、湖南機紅米四百包、價七元八角六分、盡係閩客一帮辦去、本街則均注意於洋米云、</p>
<p>標粉近平遠穩</p>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份呈近平遠穩之象、以洋麥報價、　漲五角零、坎漲一角左右、故開價後遠期市氣頗見穩俏、業外之買户、稍有活動、較前日似好半分之譜、本月份因實銷帮態度不佳、仍然平平、迨至下午開盤、本月份大致盤旋、上落甚微、遠期各月份因小廠略有出檔、并以外匯變動、人心又鬆、照目前之狀態、必須北方之實銷源源動辦、市氣方有轉機、遠期則須洋麥不再濫兜、方可立足、否則大局面終難看好也、結果本月份較前日無上落、五月份好五厘、六七月份無比價、八月份小二厘半、九月份小五厘云、</p>
<p>期麥大勢安穩</p>
<p>昨期麥市面、上下午開盤後、各月份大致呈穩定之象、因洋麥報價、好起一角或五角不等、市氣遂趨安定、本月份上午見定、下午因多頭回出、小去二分、以洋麥存底甚豐、硬撑不易、七八月份則因浮空略有抵進、市氣轉穩、惟升沉之點、在乎洋麥之來源如何、結果本月份小二分、五六月份不動、七月份好二分、八月份好四分、九月份未開、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥又見暴漲</p>
<p>週二（十八日）芝加哥小麥、因膨脹傳說、大衆作投機買進、漲近二分、又上日成交共四千萬蒲歇爾、兹將行市列左、</p>

<p>糖市　粗砂白市疲再降</p>
<p>昨日糖市、以標金轉跌、人心浮動、况以連日天雨、各路交易岑寂、二四號粗砂雖呌跌至二十一元一角、二十號中砂白呌二十元零五角、仍無成交、太古糖如Ｂ嘜二十二元四角五分、ＣＷ嘜二十二元三角、雖略有劃出、但爲數亦屬零星、國産枝洋近因來源絡繹、市勢趨跌、前昨開出百餘包、價自十八元八角至五角、比前突降五六角有奇、棉湖赤亦爲到多走弱見淡、惟粉白糖如雙蓋開十九元半、單蓋十九元、因來源有限、受手尚活耳、</p>
<p>絲茶　人造絲客銷續暢</p>
<p>近日外匯步縮、人造絲扯價益堅、而内地各綢廠對於近遠期人造絲續有需求、昨晨杭紹蘇帮在公會上抛或四五六月份　雀紅藍金鐘綠金魚雙星等牌五十二箱、價自一百六十四元五角至一百七十八元二角半凈盤云、</p>
<p>五金　搪磁廠搜羅黑鐵皮</p>
<p>黑鐵皮到貨則因天時關係、同業購定者極少、所以目下進口亦有杯水車薪之概、而搪磁廠前受存貨充塞之影響、購辦者甚鮮、因此目下均感缺貨、是以四出搜辦者大有人在、昨本埠市上現貨不多、標準看好、如厚花色估十二元、比前漲起四角半、薄花色售十四元八角七分、比前亦好二角七分、</p>
<p>馬口鐵跟錫市上漲</p>
<p>連日點錫市面、頻頻上漲、致馬口鐵來價亦跟高數辨士至二先令不等、如會司鐵英貨要十六鎊十一先令、九十磅又十八先令、一百磅十九先令二辨士、惟本埠同業則因價太高、故無訂交云</p>

<h3>中國便秘藥之世界的活動</h3>
<p>英日政府藥典熱烈推奬</p>
<p>歐美大學醫院歡迎採用</p>
<p>藥理說明</p>
<p>函索奉贈</p>
<p>「天天通」藥片之主要成分，係國産大黄素，按大黄其性駿快，推陳致新，如戢定禍亂以致太平，所以有「將軍」之號，神農本草，已認爲便秘良藥，金宣宗帝以大黄熬膏和丸，服之有奇騐，勅賜名「保安丸，」此我國數千年來百千萬醫師所屢試屢騐，而未嘗一誤者便秘痔瘡</p>
<p>天天通</p>
<p>根治靈藥</p>
<p>也，故國醫學上大黄地位之重要，幾與人參相　，因有「人參是治世良相，大黄是定世良將」之評語，於是乎中國大黄之聲譽，已傳播國内外矣，迨海禁大開以還，始從上海輸出至歐美諸國，泰西醫界見大黄之兼具健胃與緩下之神功，較諸任何西藥爲卓，遂競相努力研究大黄之移植，期欲化成各自國之特産，然而歐美諸國及日本所移植之大黄，因地質與氣候之殊異，其外形，色澤，香味，效力等，較諸中國大黄，有霄壤之差，故現今日本政府藥典，載有「中國大黄較諸任何國産爲第一理想的便秘藥」之賞讚，英國大黄製品，概以中國大黄粉塗之，以裝璜表面，而發售於歐美市塲，由此觀之，中國大黄於世界之地位尊榮，可以想見，本廠將國産大黄，應用科學的方法，提鍊其精華，以作本劑之主要成分，蓋其性和平，無副作用，對習慣性便秘症，雖繼續使用，能奏持續同一之功效，且患痔瘡者服之，則大便甚軟，並不壓迫其患部，故有助長自然療治之妙功，佛光牌科學國藥天天通定價每管（服十天）洋四角</p>

<h3>抵抗心敵</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>敵分三路進犯深入關内的惡耗，又不幸的一一證實了！要人宣言中總說：「勝不足喜，敗不足憂，」現在國事糟到電般地步，當然又是一個「敗不足憂」了。</p>
<p>我說：誠然敗不足憂。敵會深入，敵也會遠遁，只須國民掙氣，總可以把敵人逐出境外的。但是，倭敵不足懼，心敵大足憂！倭敵深入，可以驅敵出境；心敵深入，却不能驅敵出境；而且，敵分三路，六路，九路，以至無窮路來犯，比着倭宼的陷秦島，據北戴河，破喜峯口，尤其聲勢洶湧而不可抵禦，唉！宼深矣！可奈何？</p>
<p>心敵旣這麽的猖獗，專會伺瑕抵隙向着人家的方寸園地進犯。侵入官僚的園地，便會吸收着民脂民膏，存放到外國銀行裏面。侵入軍人的園地便會把掙獰面目對付商民，把三退三讓的態度對付日軍僞軍。侵入商人的園地，便會用着秘密手段去販運仇貨，而表面上只說愛國之心不敢後人。侵入男女學生的園地，便會陶醉在電影跳舞場中，大有不問國難但問摩登的趨勢。還有其他種種摧毁人格的心敵，專向意志薄弱者的園地進攻，認賊作父也好，引狼入室也好，爲虎作倀也好，唉！我不忍說了。</p>
<p>心敵不除，愛國的陣線便岌岌可危，要挽救這嚴重的國難，須得在人人方寸園地上築着森嚴壁壘，一致抵抗着分爲三路，六路，九路，以致無窮路來犯的心敵，心敵一除，那麽倭敵便不待驅而自退了。</p>
<h3>鑰匙</h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>一個人除了自已生命之外，甚麽東西算最寳貴，最親愛？老婆麽？老婆也許要反目，要離婚：所以不能算最寳貴，最親愛的東西。子女麽？世間上只有父母寳貴子女，疼愛子女：子女對於爸娘，未必個個人曉得孝順親愛；所以想穿了的人，也否認子女是最寳貴，最親愛的東西。講對我們的國家，自有政府，官僚，軍人們，來辦内政外交，國家的休戚榮辱，和我們做小百姓的，有什麽相關。他們官僚軍人，對於失地國恥，尚且老不負責任，何况我們小百姓；所以國家也算不來我們最寳貴，最親愛的東西！要曉得人們最寳貴，最親愛的一件寳貝，不是别的，便是天天寸步不離，高臥在富人褲襠裏的隨身法寳！鑰匙。</p>
<p>這是在下到了今年「不惑」之年，方纔明白起來的。原來在下當了廿多年敎書匠，做人講話，素不曉得關子。一支秃筆，幾本破書，也用不着藏諸金匱石室，當然身上没有鑰匙。目下在機關裏混混，耳濡目染，方纔感到學問無止境到老學勿盡！做人講話，都要像燉煌石室裏的秘笈一般，使人奥妙無窮！一管鑰匙，應該藏在自已肚裏，使人難於開放，方纔見得做人的高明玄妙！</p>
<p>在事實上說來，鑰匙尤是無價之寳，我們因爲向來不在金融機關厮混，所以袋裏空空，無罣無碍，不要擔着兒手光降的憂。甚麽銀行錢莊的存摺，以及一切花花綠綠的鈔票，銀光燿燿的洋鈿，還有契據，借據，公債，庫劵，賬册，首飾，珍物，：：：這些富人都不是藏在銀箱裏的麽？除了富人本人以外，誰得開這銀箱。開銀箱要用鑰匙，所以我們常常見到富人在褲襠裏亂摸，不久的將來，這管銀箱的鑰匙，便要工作了。富人的銀錢進出愈繁，鑰匙的工作愈忙，褲襠裏的摸來摸去，也没有間斷的時間了。從旁觀冷眼瞧過去，這管小小鑰匙，眞是富人最寳貴最親愛的東西了。</p>
<h3>晨的浦濱</h3>
<p>— 柯定盦</p>
<p>這也是不合上海都市人們的壞習慣吧：因爲我一到晚上的十點鐘，無論如何，總要到黑甜鄉去尋快樂；早上的天一放光，就要起來。這種習慣，我自已知道是很不合乎現代人的，可是一方面在我自已的身體上來講，到有說不出的好處，那麽這個壞習慣也許一般人所能同情而贊美的。</p>
<p>深春的氣候，在今年是特異的，竟還會這般的冷，早上起來，房間裏的寒暑表，總在四○度，我雖然不怕冷，但是每天起來呵出的氣能夠看出它的形象來，從知寒氣還充滿在人間。</p>
<p>那天，比較的暖和些了，照常的起身，在聽見海關鐘宏大的聲音打了六下之後，獨自一個兒走到黄浦江濱，來鑒賞晨的異景。</p>
<p>銅人碼頭先去玩，一羣大概從浦東放着小汽船送過來的日本孩子，背上掛了書包，跳跳躍躍的上來，同時管小汽船的機手中國人，得意揚揚地地開着去了　　待渡的人，形色怱怱的走上了渡輪，一個就要臨盆的大肚子婦人，背了一個大包裹，手裏提了一個五斤頭的罎子，還挈了一個嘴裏咬着油條的五六歲的男孩，很蹣跚的上船，同時有個工人模樣的少年，他並不來帮助那婦人，做出油滑的神情，在船上向那婦人竊笑着。</p>
<p>大帆船·小帆船·赤膊船·！是一個光船，有些人呌赤膊船丨舢板船，汽船：：：等，極有圖案意味地點綴在浦江之中，移動得很有情波。</p>
<p>我常常稱道一般苦力，是人間至聖。你想，上海果然是繁華的都市，可是没有一般苦力造成，我想始終是不能成其爲繁華都市吧！在那外灘公園附近的一個碼頭，至聖的苦力，已經開始動作了，在「杭育丨杭育丨」的呼聲中，應躍着至高至上的音調，比了繁呵令的節奏，超出萬倍的動聽，就是少女的珠喉，也及不上他的高妙呢！</p>
<p>回來的時候，那高聳雲霄的沙遜大厦的金頂，已給太陽照射得耀入眼睛了。</p>

<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第四回</p>
<p>情局復開茶寮傾積愫</p>
<p>年關難渡質庫作哀鳴</p>
<p>他看了一看桂枝，問道：要寫多少錢？桂枝道：給我寫三兩銀子罷。伙計將褥子一捲，向外推着道：姑娘，你拿去罷。三兩銀子是多少錢，做也可以做起來了。桂枝道：你不知道年三十夜等着錢使嗎？少寫就少寫一點罷。伙計道：這年三十夜當東西，我們就是帮忙的事，給你寫一兩二錢罷。桂枝道：一兩二錢，還不到兩塊錢呢丨怎麽着，你也得寫二兩四錢。伙計道：那辦不到。說着，他照應别個主顧去了。桂枝也不肯走，跟着他呌道：掌櫃的，掌櫃的丨你說帮忙，再少寫二錢，行不行？伙計道：你這種東西，都不值什麽，給你當一兩二，就算作好事。這一句話，引動了桂枝的氣了，紅着臉道：什麽作好事，我有東西當你的錢，又不呌你白捨。你作好事，可收人家按月三分利呢。你們開當坊發財，是那裏來的，不都是掙的我們窮人頭上的錢嗎？不是今天年三十夜，我可要說出好出來了。伊說話的聲音，非常之大，引出一個有鬍子的老伙計來，向伊搖搖手道：姑娘，有話好商量，别嚷丨你說我們掙三分利，可知道我們由銀行裏借來的錢，也是一分四五厘呢。刨去開銷蝕耗，我們能掙什麽錢，這也無非是與人方便自已方便的一種買賣。他說着話，將褥子打開，又將衣服看了一看，笑道：好罷，我給你寫二兩，實在不能再多了。桂枝覺着錢還是不夠還債，正要爭持呢，忽然後面有人呌了一聲老姑娘，這一呌，呌得適當其分，便種下以後許多事故之因來。</p>

<h3>生意訣</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>一天，在下到邑廟前一家酒店飲酒，遇着一位開素菜館的老闆。在把酒閒話的當兒，當然要談談生意經。在下便問那老闆道：近來你們生意如何？他答道：生意是還好。不過生意要人做的，會做生意與不會做生意，大有分别。講到做生意，進貨一層，很有關係。這不但我們的行業爲然，譬如素菜中的冬菇，需用最廣。國貨每擔售銀一百五六十兩，東貨（即東洋貨）每擔祇售銀七十兩，而且貨色又好，肉質又厚。倘然用東貨，我們門市炒冬菇，每盆售大洋八角。利息就很厚，又討好顧客，都吃得津津有味。反之，若用本貨冬菇，那就無利可圖，說不定還要蝕本，顧客還要嘰哩咕嚕，嫌味道不佳。所以開店的只好向「價廉物美」一方面走，這也是無可奈何的事。再到行裏進貨的時候，要放出眼光，看定貨色，不必問它東貨不東貨，彼此心照不宣就是了。總之，做生意的人，都是將本求利，以賺錢爲宗旨，談不到愛國不愛國。要愛國就難以賺錢，要賺錢就難以愛國，二者不能並顧。倘是有錢不要賺，口裏喊着愛國，眼巴巴看着人家撈錢，這豈不是戇大嗎？你看近年來造洋房，坐汽車，討姨太太的大老闆，若問他生財之道，多數是做東洋貨發財咧丨在下聽他這一席話，嘆了一口氣道：唉丨做生意的秘訣，原來如此，眞正愛國的，纔是傻子。那想發財的，都是聰明人。可惜聰明人太多，國家纔會弄到這般地步丨</p>

<h3>還鄉雜記</h3>
<p>— 天棲</p>
<p>我的故鄉，是紹興城裏，紹興的城，據說還是吳越時越國大夫范蠡所建築，所以紹興城别名「越城」，又號「蠡城」。這「城」雖然有一點歷史的價值，畢竟又古又舊，成爲時代的落伍者，和氣象萬千，繁華富麗的東方第一大都會「上海」相比，自然顯出「文」「野」之别，所以我回到紹興去，朋友們照例說我回到「鄉下頭」去　　故鄉終究是故鄉，被上海人目之爲「鄉下頭」，誰曰不宜？報紙上雖然用挺大的特號字，刊着什麽。危急，什麽。失陷，但上海依然是笙歌遍地，一派昇平景象；紹興和什麽。什麽。距離得更遠些，自然是世外桃源，「不知有漢，無論魏晋」了！</p>
<p>到眞正的鄉下（紹興的鄉下）去了幾天，看到金黄的菜花，碧綠的麥苗，到處滿含「生機」，因此聯想到公司中攝製的「生機」影片，不知攝竣没有？因爲我臨行的時候，「生機」只有一二塲戲，便可完成，而影片完成後的一部份工作，要等我去做。</p>

<p>甲君說：「杭州有一位姓高的，在他財産中提出二萬塊錢，存在銀行裏，訂明他活着的時候，是動息不動本，到了他死後，則連息也不動，經過八十年後，把本息一起充作地方公益之用，他又在官廳方面備了案，防止子孫或地方不肖人士的借端動用。如果到了八十年後，那可了不得，照普通利率計算，經過七年以後，便有加倍的利息，例如：存洋二萬元，經過七年以後，本利共有四萬元。依此累進，二萬元存欵，經過七十七年以後，連本帶利，已達四千零九十六萬元，現在定期八十年，則本利合計，至少在五千萬元以上，如此鉅欵，不但舉辦地方公益，綽有裕餘，卽用以購飛機，造軍艦，也有相當成效哩。」</p>
<p>我說：「這方法果然很好，現在救國的方法，注重「長期」，如「長期抵抗」之類，我的意思，愛國的富人們，不妨仿照那位姓高的辦法，來一下「長期儲金救國」，雖然期限長一些，可是意想不到之效力，就在這「長期」上！」</p>
<p>乙君說：「我現在有四個兒子，一個女兒，眞是太作孽」！</p>
<p>「這話怎講」？我驚異地問。</p>
<p>「在這種時世艱難的年頭兒，生了他們，徒使他們到世上來受罪！」乙君研究佛學，這話頗含哲理。</p>
<p>「這是你和夫人愛情太濃厚了！」我笑道。</p>
<p>「我天天住在校裏，很少回家去。」乙君辯道　　「這所謂寡慾多男！」</p>
<p>「：：：：：：」</p>
<p>丙君道：「民衆敎育館中，本有兩位講演員，每月出發到各鄉去講演，雖然聽衆寥寥，不及賣梨膏糖的小熱昏之有召號力，有時還要受鄉下人的揶揄，責難，但是講演員爲了吃飯問題，只好照例出發，照例講演，後來敎育行政當局，不知是爲了這種講演没有意思，還是爲了節省經費，竟把這講演員裁了，但是講演稿依舊須按月撰就，送呈敎育廳審核，因爲講演稿必須經敎育廳核准後，方可照講。現在講演員裁了，講演稿却照舊送核，這種文章，未免做得太没意識了」！</p>
<p>我道：「此之謂紙上空談的官樣文章！」</p>
<p>一星期的假期，眨眨眼就到了。我對於故鄉，雖然並不憎惡，但也没有什麽留戀，於是在滿滿的春雨中，又到了上海。</p>

<h3>廣告摘要</h3>
<p>— 達伍</p>
<p>看報不看廣告，正像吃蟹不吃蟹脚。有許多從新聞，從時論，或從報屁股上看不到的奇文佳作，却往往從廣告中發現出來。這裏抄一段作例，是某家影戲院的歌舞廣告：</p>
<p>「自有歌舞班以來，能：：：成名者，僅　　歌舞班而已，蓋該班藝員之精彩在：肥臀顫動，變化無窮，能銷柳惠之魂，曲線微呈，已足醉魯男之魄，觀其身，使人目迷神眩，心蕩意消，近其旁，則麝馥蘭芳，更使人筋酥骨軟：：：實有無窮之新奇艷異妖冶神秘之本能存乎其間也。」</p>
<p>不消說，這當然是銷魂奪魄的文章，并不要實地去看歌舞，就已經使人筋酥骨軟。順便一檢查當天所有的電影廣告，其中有八家是加演粉腿酥胸，犧牲色相的肉感歌舞的，一家是表演「新興革命藝術」歌舞。從這些廣告中，再「忍痛」抄下兩則來示例：</p>
<p>「穠歌膩舞，現代的，藝術的，空前的，誘人的，自有眞價，毋待吹嘘。羣雌顏如玉，裸而歌，裸而舞，裸而撩撥人們的青春，妙樂似仙音，蕩人魂，銷人魄，感人的心，醉人的意。」</p>
<p>「同時聘請Ｘ國女子歌舞班全體美貌年輕女子登台表演特種裸體艷舞，美感藝化，達於極點。不僅藝術公開，亦且犧牲色相。幼童不過十六歲恕不招待。</p>
<p>這八家有歌舞表演的戲院中，有七家的歌舞班是從外國來的碧眼女子，一家是「　　團滑稽大家」，國貨也。而且也是「粉腿與酥胸，曲線盡呈現。」再一查這幾家所開映的影片通是舶來片，而且也通是俠盜，色慾，野獸，恐怖之類的片子。從這一個小而又小的綂計，於是乎恍然大悟這舊世界的藝術的崩潰，無力，到了怎樣的程度，至於不能不拿肉體來翻本。我們只要看最近幾張從神怪武俠中解放出來的國産片，賣坐之盛，就可以瞭然於市民們心理的趨向了。這就是有力的反證，而况且，市民們所代表的意識并不是最前線。</p>
<p>至於這些錦繡文章的廣告，實在使人無話可說，索性，再剪一點東西貼在下面：</p>
<p>「諸君閱報至此，請虔誦南無阿彌陀佛，或千遍，或百遍，或十遍，當獲現世十種功德。」</p>
<h3>應用文講話</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>據說，白話文流行以來，辦文書的師爺將要絶種了；現在還有幾個「魯靈光殿」式的老頭子撑塲面，但魯靈光殿馬上就要倒的，豈非有絶種之慮？</p>
<p>文書師爺的佳話裏，有幾個頭兒腦兒的人物：民國初元，替黎元洪做駢儷通電的饒漢祥，光緒年間，替皇帝做罪已詔的樊增祥，都做了些古色古香，情文並我的「典謨訓誥」，大爲師爺們所傾倒。文書聖手的拿手好戲，說是從夾擋裏開出天地，其秘訣從八股文中學來；並不冠冕，偏說得十分堂皇；明明無恥，却喊得非常嚮喨。清初，大家在異族面前磕頭，問心未免有愧；文書師爺搖一搖筆桿，道：「殺吾君者吾仇也，殺吾仇者吾君也。」儘管磕頭，心君爲之泰然。甲子之役，盧永祥打了敗仗，决定下野出洋，臉上未免無光：文書師爺搖一搖筆桿，道：「愛國不敢後人，成功豈必自我！」請將軍體體面面下場。在主子憂心如結的時候，奴才能想法替他分憂，文書師爺之不能讓他絶種，其理甚明。</p>
<p>且擱開文書師爺之善做夾擋中妙文不提，單講善做兩扇妙文之另一種名手。其人是偉人，他是某組織的「上頭」，乃着手做兩扇文章：先把現有勢力分成兩扇，讓牠對壘起來。「甲」與「乙」鬥，看誰勝誰敗，乙失敗了，他就用甲。同時培植另一「丙」的勢力以成兩扇。「甲」與「丙」鬥，「甲」失敗了，他就用「丙」，又立培植另一「丁」的勢力以成兩扇。這樣兩扇兩扇好文章寫下去，而他高高在上。慈禧太后，袁世凱，徐世昌：都以善於做這一種文章名於世。不過高高在上，也能常打如意算盤。有時，兩扇文章正做得意，忽然上頭將他一轉，截然中斷，接不下去，只好扮個鬼臉下塲；如徐世昌一生圓滑，不免於觸一鼻子灰，卽是上頭轉了一轉的原故。近百年來，做來做去，從來不曾脫笱的只有那「上頭」的「上頭」，！呌做「帝國主義」他方是八股文的第一把名手。他就「中國」這個題目先做了兩扇文章：第一扇，帮清庭消滅革命勢力；第二扇，帮革命黨推倒清庭。辛亥革命成功了，又來了兩扇：第一扇：帮袁世凱消滅國民黨；第二扇，帮國民黨推倒袁世凱。袁世凱上天了，又來了兩扇：第一扇，帮北洋軍閥消滅國民黨；第二扇，帮國民黨打倒北洋軍閥。中間還有許多妙文，也是兩扇兩扇地做成：帮直倒皖，帮皖倒直：帮奉倒直，帮直倒奉。只有民國十六年，國民革命到了漢口，眼見得兩扇妙文要脫鼻了，他急得什麽似的；幸而凑搭得快，又搭成了兩扇。以目前現狀觀之，這種兩扇文章，他一時還做不完呢！</p>
<p>或曰：「必先攘外而後可以安内」與「必先安内而後可以攘外」，豈非絶妙兩扇文章乎？作應之曰：我們的「上頭」只能做一扇；惟「上頭的上頭」，方能做成兩扇。你要「而後」嗎？看你「必先」不得！你要「必先」嗎？看你如何「灤</p>
<p>而後」？左右開弓，恰到好處，眞是天下惟一妙文，卽饒漢祥樊增祥都要傾倒不止。宋趙普用半部論語治天下，「上頭」的「上頭」，用兩扇文章「亂」（朱註：亂，治也。）天下，此之謂「文」之「應用」。</p>
<h3>中國民族復興之路</h3>
<p>— 程雲萍</p>
<p>中國政治不上軌道，是不必諱言的事實。那病根，已給到歐洲去考察過的人考察出來了。</p>
<p>第一，據說中國今日不在制度問題，而在人的問題。那就是說，只要有英雄出來，（如莫索里尼，希特勒之流便是丨萍註）中國就可以復興。狄克推多固然好，君主專制也好，即使制度本身有毒質，制度本身有令人作惡的原素，全不成問題。聖人出，黄河之水自然清。　　第二，中國今日究竟有没有那樣的英雄呢？據說英雄是有的，只是國人不一致擁戴，不能做順民。一事發生，便各抒已見，議論紛紜。（如不抵抗，直接交涉，就七嘴八舌，閙得頗利害，丨萍註）使英雄做事礙手。</p>
<p>第三，中國人最大的毛病是只會做文章，講空話，不能切實履行。這見識，自然也是千眞萬確的。譬如國難發生以來，在上者的煌煌文告，我們實在拜讀過不少；但是，「誓死抗敵」「收復失地」的事實在那裏？至於在下的貧苦小民，也只是空言救國。譬如捐欵購飛機，就太不踴躍，至今買得的飛機，還遠不如張少帥那一次被日本搶去的那樣多。這當然又是「罪該萬死」的丨</p>
<p>總之，中國民族復興之路應該是：實行狄克推多制，請「英雄」出臺，小百姓一致擁戴，禁止喧譁。同時，大家該掏荷包救國。就是無荷包可掏，賣兒鬻女也决「義無可辭」。</p>
<h3>回鄉雜記</h3>
<p>— 穆時英</p>
<p>二魚和鹽的城市</p>
<p>寗波眞是座魚和鹽的城市，一走到街上就聽到喊賣黄魚的聲音。我們走過一條街，那眞可以說是鹹魚街了，滿街全是鹹魚行，門口擺着許多竹簍，簍裏邊全是扁平的，有着呆滯的眼珠子的死魚，一點知覺也没有似的疊在那兒。在空氣裏邊醖釀着丨那麽親切可愛的氣味啊丨我覺得這城市裏，連太陽光也帶着鹽味的；因爲這是焦黄的强烈的太陽光，不像上海那麽淡淡的，老在打呵欠，伸懶腰似的。</p>
<p>這小商埠裏的一切都使我們覺得新奇而不近情理。街旁的商店，廣告，車馬行駛的方式，走路的習慣，全和上海的不同。有一張大廉價的廣告那麽寫着：「本店素抱不抵抗大廉價主義，凡有雇客向本店所有貨物進攻者，决廉價接受丨」寗波人眞是滑稽的人，街上的行人走路的方式差一點把我笑壞了。往前去的不一定打左邊走，往這邊來的也不一定打右邊走，每個人都東拐西灣，隨意亂撞，一邊在嘴裏　　喝喝的。我走了一條街給五個人碰了，眞碰得可笑，有一次我在往前走對面來了一個人，嘴裏　　喝喝的，意思是呌我讓開，我便往裏拐一點，他也猛的一拐，拐到你身上。還有一次，也是對面來了人，我在外邊兒，他在裏邊，怎麽也不會碰的，走到跟前，不料他忽然一拐灣撞到我身上，撞了一下，嘴裏還是　　喝喝的，擺着一張無表情的臉横過街去了。他撞我一下，就因爲他要横過街去丨這一下我差一釘點笑彎了腰。</p>
<p>在街上走了不到一個鐘頭，我們三個人眞得把肚子也笑痛了。拉黄包車的那氣勢也和上海不同，愛威風揚揚的從人裏邊穿過去，也不喊一聲讓開，或是打一個招呼。我們三個人是並着走的，老有黄包車冷不防的從你後邊飛來，一聲不響地把我們往兩邊一分硬鑽了過去。坐包車的冷態也有趣得利害：高高的坐在那兒，用大指和食指下死勁拿着烟捲往嘴裏塞，腦袋仰着點兒，嘴撅着點兒，可是還擺着一張悠遊自在得意非常的臉，把脚偷偷地踏底下的鈴，噹噹地閙得人心慌。</p>
<p>這城市還有一點使我們奇怪的地方，我們走了這許多路，没看到一個呌化的。這城市裏的吃着魚和鹽的居民好像全有一張不屑低頭屈腰的倔强臉。</p>
<p>寗波，眞是個又古怪又有味的城市。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>「不要哭了，你的爸爸回來了。」</p>
<p>秋英說了後，在咭咭地笑。海泉知道她是在故意這樣地說笑。</p>
<p>「是我，不是老曹。」</p>
<p>海泉趕忙申明。他一面說，一面除了帽兒走進房裏來了。大概是夜深了，房裏的電光分外的亮。他看見秋英的雙頰，像是喝了酒，紅亮亮的會反照光線的一樣。他覺得她今晚上是特别的美麗。</p>
<p>「就呌林先生做爸爸好了。」</p>
<p>因爲小孩子不肯睡，她又把他抱了起來。她一邊說，一邊走向海泉身邊來。海泉不像上半天那樣的手慌脚亂了。他伸出隻腕加到秋英的肩背上了。他俩又在親吻了。</p>
<p>「老曹還没有回來麽？」</p>
<p>「聖誕節快到了，敎會裏忙吧，不要管他。知道他什麽時候才得回來，我們睡我們的。：：」</p>
<p>「：：：：：：」</p>
<p>海泉不明白她的說話的意思，半响没有回聲。</p>
<p>「等我替你把行軍床擺好。林伯伯，你抱着他。：：：」</p>
<p>此刻她親暱地改稱他做林伯伯了，他又完全忘掉二三小時以前的孤寂和悲哀了。</p>
<p>「不。等老曹回來了再說吧，不然，我們要相對着坐到天亮呢。」</p>
<p>「那末，你坐着等他好了。到了時候，我是非睡不可的。：：：」</p>
<p>他俩說說笑笑，又過了一個多時辰，看看快要響十二點了，小孩子也睡了，她也半坐半臥的靠着床欄打瞌睡。海泉便想，這才　尶，不知道睡好還是不睡好。當他感着一陣從未經騐的誘惑時，他的全身便起了一陣寒顫，於是他又失掉了一切的勇氣了。</p>
<p>她一翻身起來，脫外衣了。</p>
<p>「林先生，我要睡了。你不睡麽？」</p>
<p>她只穿着睡衣了。她走到門首去，把房門扉閂上了。</p>
<p>「老曹還没有回來呢。」</p>
<p>「回來了，再開。」</p>
<p>她揉了揉眼睛，爬上了床，鑽進被窩裏去了。</p>
<p>「那我到外面去走走。」</p>
<p>「到那裏去？」</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>風世歟？警世歟？</h3>
<p>— 祥鼎</p>
<p>我眞不懂，陸根榮是怎樣一位了不起的人物和做了怎樣風光的事，以致于勞動電影院老闆的「重金禮聘」，不顧血本的在報上登了比冷口失守還大的鉛字廣告？而尤不懂者，居然使成千成萬的太太先生們爭先恐後的去「瞻仰顏色」丨　　陸根榮終算是一位幸運兒，初則有黄小姐的垂青，吃了一些官司後，終于又有偌大電影院老闆的「重金禮聘」，更有許多太太小姐們的肯賞臉而來「欣賞」，想來如果黄小姐地下（恐不在地下）有知，也當瞑目無怨矣。</p>
<p>湯玉麟從放棄承德以後，終算倒霉倒透了，在被政府查辦和人民唾駡不算外，現在竟被一個厮養的陸根榮糟蹋起來，所謂「陸根榮活捉湯玉麟」，雖已成爲陸根榮的「不朽之作」而亦某電影院所恃爲「生財之道」，但湯將軍可也就「威風掃地」到極點哩，湯玉麟之被人糟蹋固屬咎由自取，但陸根榮究屬是一位何等樣人物，</p>
<p>我眞佩服，那家電影院老闆的「顧慮周到」，惟恐一個十足道地的眞眞陸根榮，和一齣一九三三年最新式的創作「陸根榮活捉湯玉麟」，尚不能「以廣招徠」，于是又有一齣「壓軸戲」而亦看客所認爲「精采表演」的所謂請本人（即陸概榮本人）報告犯罪與坐牢之經過」，</p>
<p>小子識見淺薄，有生以來，祇聽見過請某某專家「報告赴某國考察之經過」，或某將軍代表來滬「報告抗日經過」之類，至于請一個因偷情而吃過官司的人來「報告犯罪和坐牢之經過」，小子却自愧未之前聞。</p>
<p>在被洋錢眩花了眼睛的人們，他所打算着的，不過是如何增加自已營業的收入，所以不惜請陸根榮這樣一個人來當衆「現身說法」，其餘原可一切不管。</p>
<p>其實，嚴格的說來，僅僅陸根榮的「報告犯罪經過」，還不足以十分的吸引看客，爲那家電影院老闆設想，最好此後到八仙橋去聘一位淌白或野鷄，請她在戲台上公開的「報告ＸＸ之經過」，則風聲所播，說不定「四方來歸」，那時咱敢保險一定「門庭若市」，以至于掛出「客滿」之牌哩。</p>
<p>此外，寄語一般厮養聽着者，望你們趕快努力于勾引你們主人的千金，其結果說不定也有電影院來向你們「重金禮聘」哩。</p>

<h3>談談兩化元算捷法</h3>
<p>— 天鐸</p>
<p>本報四月六日歐陽任賢君兩化元之七一五捷法後先後有蔚君任君丁君永祥君等或則建議宏論或則修改更正然大部可分三種一利用西洋省略捷算法計算二利用分項計算制定口訣後疊加而成三利用我國通行之珠算法制定口訣計算惟以各術數有異同且欠詳細說明學者無從標準爰爲草此篇搜集本刊各家言論而再略加說明俾資讀者玩味</p>
<p>今先言西洋省略捷算法</p>
<p>此法請參閱本月十日十四日十五日本刊蔚君丁崇君所作之「兩化元之又一捷法」「最簡捷的兩元換算法」等今特再爲補充說明理由如下</p>
<p>由兩化元而以一·四法定數乘兩數後再減去其積之千分之一所得即爲本術另列式如下</p>
<p>由兩化元＝（兩數Ｘ１·４）丨（兩數Ｘ１·４Ｘ００１）＝元數　＝兩數Ｘ（１·４）丨（０·００１４）＝兩數Ｘ１·３９８６</p>
<p>而一·三九八六相似○·七一五之倒數１·３９８６０１　８３及r上有·者表示循環　後伤此）○·七一五之倒數謂者即以一爲單位作爲被除數而以○·七一五有除數所得之商之謂也元旣以○·七一五爲法定價則每兩之化元數當然係以○·七一五除一是也今○·七一五除一之商旣如上述則與本法之法定數一·三九八六（即一·四減○·○○一四）相較只差０·０００００１３９８６依據近似算規則當然第六位小數以下無庸計算故本法採取一·四減○·○○一四爲法定數也且一四之爲數因爲二位數而其十位數又爲一在珠算上亦可小施捷法今述其法如下（閱者可自研之）例如四八六七五三乘一四等於六八一四五四二列式如下（式中因恐排板有悮及便在珠算上演習故列有，號以醒目正位）</p>
<p>４８６７５３·　似定如今有銀四八</p>

<p>····２０＝５Ｘ４　爲若干元當然依本</p>

<p>＋１６·····＝４Ｘ４　四二爲六八○七七二·七四五八元</p>
<p>６８１４５４２</p>
<p>此法旣如上述簡捷惟有一缺點即逢十萬兩之大數每與本來眞確數相差一角三分九厘餘且有明係七一五之倍數之兩數而所得之元數每稍缺些微此種情形似乎美中不足耳</p>
<p>二分項計算制定口訣而後疊加法此法請參閱四月十一日任君「兩元換算又一捷法」及十七日永祥君之「更正兩元換算又一捷法」</p>
<p>初任君之法亦具有第一種捷法之缺點後雖有永祥君加以補充後然仍未臻完善且口訣冗長而難憶記牽涉位數亦其多法雖甚捷但亦美中不足者</p>
<p>三我國通行之珠算法</p>
<p>此法爲四月六日歐陽任賢君所作之兩化元之七一五捷法此法只列口訣而不加說明今特稍加修改而制定說明如下口訣）</p>
<p>見一下加二八五</p>
<p>見二下加五七○</p>
<p>見三改作四一四</p>
<p>見四改作五四二五</p>

<p>見六改作八二八</p>
<p>見七改作九五六五</p>
<p>逢七一五進二十</p>
<p>逢十四三進雙十</p>
<p>此口訣與歐陽君之口訣稍有出入計　　加多逢十四三進雙十一句而如一變　　二下除四三類只取「見五作八除七　　二」一句餘均删除</p>
<p>（說明）見一下加二八五者即以○七一五除一得商一而尚餘○·二八五之謂也見三改作四一四者即以○·七一五除三而得商四而尚餘○·一四之謂也（其他仿此）見五作八除七二者即以○·七一五除五若得商八則尚少○·七二故應於石擋除七二之謂也逢七一五進一十者即以○·七一五除七·一五得商十之謂也逢十四三進雙十者即以○·七一五除十四（一擋上）·三得商二十之謂也</p>
<p>（理由）根據吾國珠算口訣如四一改作二十二而爲以○·四除一得商二餘二之謂之口訣而加以變化而成此七一五歸除口訣</p>
<p>（算法）照我國通行之珠算法計算法計算之</p>
<p>（借註）此法根本依據以○·七一五</p>

<p>歸除之原則計算其優點當然能與正確數相等要得幾位小數就可求幾位小數也鐸按此法并不十分快捷只能作七一五歸除捷法算名之</p>

<p>店員通訊</p>
<h3>學問的出路</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>貴報自闢了「店員通訊」欄以來，所解答的問題，都半足供我們的參考和啓示。這種爲社會服務的精神，眞值得我們的欽佩和感戴。現在我有個問題，要費心，先生：請你不吝指敎，賜與解答。特拉雜書之於後：</p>
<p>我是本埠ＸＸ國藥店中一個櫃員，在十六歲那年，因受衣食的驅使，半途輟學：就業在一家滿怖封建色彩的店裏當學徒。彼時很感失學的痛苦，時有圖謀脫離的想念；但是終究因爲生活的威迫，忍受了三年有期徒刑的判决。我曾對自已發誓過，願粉身碎骨，不惜與環境苦鬥。但結果竟使我失望；撫今追昔，不禁使我湧起無限凄愴的回憶，然在此也不用我多嚕囌了。</p>
<p>對於我目前的職業，極感厭棄，再也不願在這樣的處境下屈服。我將出我比較强毅的精神，玄衝破周圍的壓迫。惟一的辦法，祗有脫離現有職業而别就；但我感覺到缺乏商業智識的威脅。在我的腦海中，也曾潛伏，着如何企的求想念。在本埠市商會圖書館訂了送閱辦法，但每閱簿記等類書籍：冥目思索，終不能使我完全了解。我又想入夜校去補習國文英文簿記等基本學識：但是雖有這樣的計劃，妥當與否，復使我裹足不前。我是個封建殘餘勢力下的掙扎者資本主義鐵蹄下的負傷者在呻吟殘喘之餘，深深地示弱，祇有示弱，却不能得一絲半毫舒展的曙光。我的一切理想，都陷落在虚無飄渺間，何處是我的歸宿呢？我本十二萬分的誠意，期待着</p>
<p>先生的指示。臨言不勝盼切待命之至，此請，</p>
<p>撰安　　余宜男謹上</p>
<p>Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ　　Ｘ</p>
<p>編者按：余君的來信，概括的說起來，不外下列兩點：一，對於目前的職業，極感厭棄，想要脫離了另尋别就。二，自已感覺商業知識的缺乏，想學些國文英文簿記等基本學識。查余君現在是一爿國藥店裏的職員，所以在答覆你之前，我們就不能不先把國藥業的地位談一談。我國的醫藥，自有其相當價值，有的地方，或者還比了西醫西藥更高妙：所以晚近幾年來，很有許多醫理藥物，彼西醫採用。可惜一直陳陳相因，没有有學問的人，把他發明整理，所以不能爲世所重。因此我們以爲你因爲學識不足，想找個機會來補這個缺點是對的。這不但要學些基本學識，你還可以進而研究國藥的堂奥。但是你求到了學識，就要想棄舊業而不爲，我們却不能贊同。我們希望一般的店員，在可能範圍裏，都能夠增高他學識：我們却不希望他們一有了少許學識，就去做一般人認爲較舒適的事情。學問是用來改進社會的，决不是用來搶飯碗的。我們求到了較高的學識，不應該就去搶人家現成的飯碗。我們可以運用我們求到的學識，使我目前所有的苦飯碗，漸漸裏變成肥缺，這才是大衆與我咸蒙其利的辦法呢。至於你想學些國文英文簿記等基本學識一層，我們却可以告訴你：本報因爲紀念六十週年起見，决分其餘力，服務社會，創辦了一個業餘補習學校。現在附設在南京路大陸商塲本報流通圖書館的第一校，雖則已經開課，但這幾天還在那裏辦理登記，預備不久就要加以擴充。同時我們還在虹口塘山路澄衷中學，與法租界亞爾培路中山文化敎育館，開了兩個分校，目下正在招生。我們的功課，有國文。英文，俄文，日文，簿記，算學等幾種。要是你有意補習的話，不妨到大陸商塲三四五號來報名。</p>

<h3>夢裏光陰（三十二續）</h3>
<p>— 秦瘦鷗</p>
<p>「開除之前，必須嚴厲處罰」丨劉驥很堅决地補充着。</p>
<p>「開除已經是最嚴厲的處罰了，不必再難爲他了」丨伍逸勉强裝着很鎭定的樣子，和顏悅色地向劉驥請求着。</p>
<p>「不行丨不行丨非嚴辦不可丨」</p>
<p>「請伍校長不要干涉我們的自由丨」</p>
<p>劉驥還不曾表示可否，台下六七百位血氣方剛的青年人，已按捺不住，用一種聲色俱厲的態度，一致站起來，表示反對伍老博士的調解。王國棟瞧校長也不能救護，失望得把整個的身子全軟攤在地上了。</p>
<p>「那末，我有一個主張，無論如何，必須請你們容納」丨伍逸很誠懇地向他的高徒們說道，「在你們没有决定相當的懲罰的方式之前，我爲盡我的責任起見，爲避免王國棟的家屬跟我發生什麽交涉起見，必須要求你們把他暫時交給我看管：同時，我再請訓育主任吳先生，商學院長周博士，代表我跟你們幾個當委員的討論具體的懲罰方法」。</p>
<p>第一，因爲伍逸平時對於學生們的愛國運動，總是很盡力的贊助，第二，因爲誰都不知道王國棟和伍老博士的關係的緣故，他這個提議，居然得到了大多數人的同意。</p>
<p>「但是，伍校長，你必須完全負責，不要讓他走了」！主席劉驥，又很鄭重地聲明着。</p>
<p>「當然」，伍逸打地上扶起了王國棟來，緊緊地牽着他的手，從大講台上通着後台的一面小門裏退出去，數千條驚奇萬狀的視線，齊集中在他們兩人的後影上，連王國棟也不知道這位老校長的葫蘆裏，賣的是什麽藥。</p>

<h3>顯微音器前面的動物</h3>
<p>— 深翁</p>
<p>攝取獸音的幾種妙技</p>
<p>俄國白熊的怒號聲，比任何動物都要洪大·獅子的呵欠聲，比吼聲還要高·你如果要想收取象的呼聲，必須有許多人在旁邊喧嚷着，牠才大聲嘶鳴，海豹須在極靜的環境中·才會狂呌·獅子也有這種習慣，這是派拉蒙公司收音部主任佛蘭克林Franklin　Hansen，從攝製一部獸片King　of　the　Jungle所得的經騐·</p>
<p>通常的顯微音器，用以攝取獸音，有時會失却效用的，像虎豹和其他貓類的一切動物，牠們常常喜歡向着懸在横木上的東西跳躍，就像家庭裏的小貓，喜歡向掛着的皮球跳弄一樣，所以收音的必須利用這一點，再用一種特製的收音器，去攝取牠們的聲音，而這種顯微音器，並且要非常精密，就是再微細的聲音，在五百英尺以外，也能夠收取進去的，</p>
<p>收音的技師，個個都承認俄國白熊最會呌，這種動物，豎立起來差不多有七尺高，重量大都有九百磅，比普通獅子要大一倍，因爲獸類的習性不同，所以攝取獸音的方法也就各異，譬如俄國白熊，遇着檻前有任何東西遮住的時候，就會咆哮起來，如果你要攝取牠的呼聲，祇要先拿一塊東西，在她的檻前一揚就得了，</p>
<p>據收音的技師說，那獅子的怒吼聲，確然是很可怕的；但是牠們的噴嚔聲和呵欠聲，亦復如此，這種動物，你要想呌牠們怒吼，是很不容易的：但是一個對白的命令下來後，在那數分鐘寂靜的當口，倒又好像給了牠們一種重大剌激，忽然的怒吼起來了，</p>
<p>象，本是一種最懶惰最鎭靜的動物，牠們非受到一種極大的戟剌，是决不會鼓噪的，所以只有一個法子對付牠們，祇要收音師在牠們旁邊，發出種種喧閙的聲音，那厚皮動物，就會局促不安起來，再過幾分鐘，就開始呼喊起來了，</p>
<p>當他們攝取海豹呼聲時，雖然用了許多法子，終歸失敗，後來才用對付獅子的法子去對付牠們，牠們果然狂呌了一陣，上面所說的法子，都是屢試屢騐，萬無一失的，凡是要攝取獸音的朋友，何妨依照上面的法子，去試騐一下呢？</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>「評投機夫人」MeineFrau　Lie　Hochstab　Lerin</h3>
<p>— 忠</p>
<p>這張烏發影片在新光的演出，結果也許是呌人失望吧？</p>
<p>牠在德國是很受人們歡迎的喜劇，但是實質上，牠是一張幻想的影片，非常空虚，落了美國或英國的窠臼。</p>
<p>全片失敗之點就在本事上。牠說一位銀行行員收入微薄，不幸娶了一位虚榮奢華的妻子。一天她邂逅着一位臘腸巨商，她用了交際手段，自稱她的丈夫是位銀行經理。那巨商正欲借欵，擴充營業，於是盡力拉攏，爲了商議辦法便利，約定在柏林最華貴的皇家飯店開了大房間。她當去了家中所有值錢的東西，打算在皇家飯店住一星期，以謀投機成功。不料這事尚無眉目，她的丈夫反被銀行辭掉，於是兩手空空，很是困窘。這時候飯店裏來了一位著名歌女，她和丈夫「芥菜巨商」翻了臉，她丈夫說，有人能使他夫婦重諧和好，不惜巨金酬謝。那失業的行員夫人，就特爲開了一個大晏會，從中拉攏，很巧的，歌女竟回心轉意了。歌女的丈夫允許自已的芥菜公司和臘腸公司合作，並任行員爲總理，於是投機乃告成功。</p>
<p>末尾偏呌他們如願，竟成一幕喜劇，實在是畫蛇添足，毫無意義，牠竟在鼓勵人去投機丨去貪戀夢想的安適生活丨實在是太没有價值了。</p>
<p>但是談到技術。却仍有不容湮没的與米高梅的「大飯店」爭長短的福克斯巨片「賽珍會」，内有八大明星，領導者爲惠爾羅吉士，珍妮蓋諾，劉亞理士，莎麗嬡鸞。圖爲珍妮蓋諾，和劉亞理士。</p>
<p>優點。其中唯一的，就是演員的表演，飾投機夫人的Kate　Von　Nagy表情的傳神，極稱佳妙，她絲毫不苟的演來，不見做作，唱的兩段歌，也非常悅耳動聽。她的丈夫（行員）是Heinz　Kuebmann作一個懦弱的男子，出神入化，一搭一　的唱來，也很好。兩人表演細膩，就夠得上影片的藝術價值了。其餘的像Fritz　Grunbaum　Theo　Lingen　HermanVallenlin三個人，都是德國著名優伶，表演固然可觀，但是在這裏並不重要，所以我不說什麽了。</p>
<p>導演盡職而已，見不出特殊精彩。佈景雖然很少，酷似「大飯店」中的（這投機夫人的演出，十分之九的内景，也在皇家飯店裏），尚稱生色。鏡頭運用和光線配置，都可算是難得的成績。</p>
<h3>天一瑣聞</h3>
<p>— 培元</p>
<p>黎小妹妹的第二部影片「黎明」，已定明日開拍，男主角爲新進天一之田方。據親近小妹妹者言，彼近日行動已自浪漫而趨積極。暇時便在家中研究電影藝術，一切追逐之浮滑少年，皆被摒絶，即跳舞塲中，亦不見伊之踪跡矣。</p>
<p>天一公司攝影塲本擬遷移，後邵醉翁因一時覓不到相當場地，故决將攝影塲重行修造，可使外邊各種巨細雜音隔去，現並在附近購得空地多畝，造一較大之完備攝影塲，日來已請工程師設計打樣，預料下月初可以動工。</p>
<p>陳玉梅前因拍「生機」瘁勞致病，病愈後，即與邵醉翁同赴甬鄉掃墓，并週游城内外各名勝古蹟，及新建之中山公園等處，現已回申，聞陳定今日在百代唱片以司播灌唱片，節目爲倚江樓，給摩登小姐，鐘聲，儉約歌，新催眠曲，并悉陳已擔任百代常年灌片云。</p>
<p>为了本事的拘束，全片成了滑稽片段的綜合。暗塲很多，而且很是適當，但是爲喜劇，爲了滑稽，全片就一些不能緊張了。</p>
<p>對白很多，内中有趣而可笑的更不少，但在中國，懂德文的觀衆太少，所以也不免减少了一部份的精彩。牠雖是滑稽片，除去動作以外，對白竟一些不能博到觀衆們的笑聲，可惜之至。</p>
<h3>中宣部編製「還我熱河」</h3>
<p>— 燦爛</p>
<p>日前已在南京公映</p>
<p>自熱河戰開始，以至失守，上海各影片公司，都曾派攝影師去攝了一部份帶回來，但可惜實質極少，所以遲遲未得公映。</p>
<p>消息傳來，在南京中央大禮堂公映了一張一萬餘尺的「還我熱河」，這是中央黨部宣傳部特派專員隨軍攝成的。</p>
<p>中央宣傳部的攝影部，在已往數年中只攝了一些消息照片，供給各報錄用。自從攝製那張一鳴驚人的「國難」以後，雖然曾經攝了十多本南京各種會議和偉人的行蹤等，但是都只能算是短部的新聞片。</p>
<p>這次的「還我熱河」完全中央自攝，由山海關失守，石河之役起始，一直到喜峯口，宋哲元積極抗日，準備反攻爲止。其中包括了古北口，冷口，各處軍情，對於萬福麟，孫展英，各部義勇軍的戰事，（熱河失守以前）都有極詳盡的收集，描寫孤軍作戰，血肉横飛，槍林彈雨的防禦工作，牠的慘酷緊張，當百倍於上次的「國難」。</p>
<p>在這片中雖然看不見大刀隊手刃仇敵使人快意的事，但是他們出發和衝鋒的勇敵，威武，的確能夠「起儒爲勇」，使一般大好男兒振奮不少。</p>
<p>我們對於這世界七大建築之一的萬里長城，不是景仰已久了嗎？而對於那所謂高山峻嶺，「一夫當關萬人難破」的熱河，不是也極願一觀眞象嗎，這張影片對於各險要所在的地勢等等都是瞭如指掌的。</p>
<p>這片子在四月十日曾遍請京中要人參觀，業已於前日運出五個考貝（Copy）大約於二十五日左右在蘇州公映，當然不久，就要到上海來了。</p>
<p>末尾，我希望牠早日在這裏公映，滬上人士都去領略一番，我更希望「還我熱河」，在不久的將來，便能實現。</p>

<h3>希佛萊不願再結婚</h3>
<p>— 聲宏</p>
<p>最近希佛萊和一位新聞記者發表談話。他設：「眞的我已和她離異了。她現在重作舞臺生涯，我祝她成功。也許你早已知道了，她是個歌舞家，她年紀青青，成功是極其容易的。　　「但是結婚，丨我丨不願再結婚了，因爲結婚這個壞東西足以破壞種種事情。你想想：一個男人日間在攝影塲裏拍戲。夜間回到家裏，人是多麽的疲倦，精神是多麽的混亂，這時候男人當然不喜觀說話，也不高興出去。他的妻子整天坐在家裏没事做，閒着打肫吃飯。到了夜間，她精神煥發，不是和男人談話，便是要男人同到外面白相，男人當然不贊成，於是雙方便開始口角了。所以我不願再結婚了丨」</p>

<h3>忠魂錄Cavalcade（二）</h3>
<p>— 訥</p>
<p>「羅伯，南斐洲的荷蘭農民到底關我們什麽事呢？」琪茵慘然地問着。</p>
<p>「不關我們的事嗎？你自已的親兄弟在茂甫根被敵人圍困，還有許多别的人，在那兒等　救兵。」</p>
<p>「我明白。」她勉强地伸直了她的腰肢，裝上了勇敢的氣概。「我的脾氣越變越壞了。我下回再不如此。羅伯，我們何不吩咐愛倫和勃烈吉斯一淘來喝酒，亦就是這一次；他們亦是一對夫婦，亦有一個小孩子；而他亦要去從軍了。」</p>
<p>他吻着她：「寳貝，你眞是一個甜密的寳貝。」他走向門口，喚着他的男女僕人：「愛倫，勃烈吉士，再拿幾只杯子來，帮我們來歡迎那新世紀。」</p>
<p>他們止喝着春酒，樓上的小孩子醒了。嚶嚶啜泣的聲浪傳到樓下。</p>
<p>「這新世紀太不懂禮貌了，怎麽連小孩子都吵醒了呢」？羅伯說着，忽然他腦筋中一亮。「唏，我們連小孩子都抱下來；愛倫，你去弄些牛奶，亦讓他們慶祝慶祝」。</p>
<p>「他們夜裏失了眠，不好吧？」琪茵說：</p>
<p>「那怕什麽丨一百年亦不過一回」，羅伯解釋着。琪茵亦笑了。他們一齊跑上樓，琪茵看了那兩個小寳寳還是好好地睡着，她說著祝福的話，吻着他們，將他們弄醒了。</p>
<p>兩個小寳寳愛德華和喬易，張大了眼睛，莫名其妙的，不知道這是什麽日子。</p>

<h3>Quiet on the Luan River Front</h3>
<p>No Enemy Traces West of Shimen Station</p>
<p>Enemy Applies Fierce Pressure Around Santunying</p>
<p>(Beiping) There are no battles on the west bank of the Luan River in Qian'an and Lulong. A Japanese aircraft carrier has sailed to and anchored near Beidaihe. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) There is still some local fighting at Zhugezhuang, 20 li east of the Luan River. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Enemy planes flew over the Luan River to our positions for reconnaissance four times from morning to noon on the 19th, without dropping any bombs. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Enemy troops on the east bank of the Luan River opened fire twice, morning and evening on the 19th, shelling the west bank.</p>
<p>(Beiping) The enemy, repelled by our forces on the 18th evening in the areas of Nantuanting, Beituanting, and Guanzhuang, suffered heavy losses and did not attack us on the 19th. The enemy opposite Baitazhai added more than ten artillery pieces on the 19th and seemed to be collecting timber there, as if preparing to cross the river. At the same time, the enemy across from Hedongzhai also appeared to be preparing to cross the river. (18th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, a little after 8:00 AM, eight enemy planes flew to Zunhua, Malanguan, Santunying, Luowenyu, Huangyako, and Longji counties for reconnaissance, lasting about an hour. They dropped six bombs at Santunying, injuring one civilian. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, several planes (one plane) and eight enemy planes yesterday morning at 10:00 AM also dropped bombs and conducted reconnaissance over the above locations, and dropped seven bombs at Xinglong, killing or wounding five civilians. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zunhua reports that the enemy is using the Motegi Division as the main force to attack our Saheqiao. Motegi has established his headquarters in Pingquan, and his forward command post is located at the Pingquan airfield. After the enemy attacking Nantuanting, Beituanting, and Guandian yesterday was routed by our forces, they were withdrawn to Pingquan to rest due to heavy losses. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luanzhou) On the 17th and 18th, the enemy pressing toward the east bank of the Luan River was repelled by our armored vehicles in coordination with infantry, and their attempts were unsuccessful. On the 19th, no enemy troops were sighted west of Shimen Station within 30 li east of the river. This morning, an enemy scout entered our sentry line and was driven away. The enemy fired guns and cannons from time to time, all landing on the beach. Our armored vehicles also fired at the enemy from time to time to show our strength and maintain strict vigilance. In recent days, enemy planes have come to Luan City for reconnaissance every day. They bombed north of the Luan River on the 16th, but did not drop any bombs on other days. He Zhuguo is now stationed in Luan, and the future development of the Japanese army depends entirely on the Tianjin-Beiping issue. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After our troops along the Beining Railway successively withdrew to the west bank defense line of the Luan River, no clashes occurred at the front yesterday or today. Both sides are reorganizing. Our armored vehicles and a portion of cavalry are still operating back and forth near the Luan River Bridge this morning, blocking the enemy's advance. The enemy's vanguard is still stopped in an area more than ten li away from Luanzhou. The enemy plans to use a large force to fiercely pressure our Song troops around Santunying in the upper reaches of the Luan River in the short term, and then cross the Luan River with full force to advance westward. Our army, starting from Luanzhou, has established extremely solid defenses along the right bank of the Luan River. If the enemy attacks, we are determined to engage them. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zunhua reports that yesterday afternoon, more than 100 enemy cavalry arrived at Hedongzhai Dongying and captured more than 30 people, apparently to use civilians to guide them across the river. We have taken strict precautions. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Pursue Beining Train</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the morning of the 18th, when the Beining train was coming from Luanzhou, a Japanese plane pursued the train, firing machine guns at it without hitting. It chased the train to Tuozitou, west of Luanzhou, and then flew away. On the east and west banks of the Luan River, both sides engaged in artillery battles throughout the night of the 17th. There were no battles on both banks on the 18th. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Three Japanese planes chased and attacked the 8th passenger train leaving west from the Luan River this morning, returning to the Luan River at Leizhuang. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Our Armored Vehicles Guard the East Bank of the River</p>
<p>(Beiping) On the east bank of the Luan River, our Zhongshan armored vehicle and a portion of cavalry are guarding the area, and are in contact with the enemy from time to time. The enemy is using heavy artillery to shell our positions from Tushanzi in Zhugezhuang. The sound of artillery fire can be heard in Luanzhou. Their infantry has not dared to advance. The headquarters of the puppet army's Li Jichun is located in Liuying. More than 200 enemy troops have arrived at Qinhuangdao, and more than 500 enemy troops are stationed in Beidaihe. Enemy planes are still flying over both banks of our Luan River from time to time this morning for reconnaissance and bombing. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Zhongshan Armored Vehicle Returns to Luanzhou</p>
<p>(Beiping) Last night, the Zhongshan armored vehicle returned to the Luan River, and covered the crossing of various units across the river to the west. (19th Dispatch) The Enemy's Artillery Vehicles Carry Out Long-Range Shooting</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning in Qian'an County, more than 1,000 enemy troops attempted to cross the river but were repelled by our forces. At 4:00 AM this morning, a column of enemy armored vehicles and artillery vehicles drove to Anshan Station and carried out long-range shooting at the Luan River with artillery fire, lasting for two hours before stopping. The enemy troops on the left side of the railway are moving toward a certain location in the upper reaches of the Luan River this morning. Four enemy planes bombed our positions in the Huishan area, dropping a total of more than 20 bombs. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Enemy Planes Fly to the Luan River for Reconnaissance</p>
<p>(Beiping) Luanzhou reports that enemy and our troops are currently in a standoff on the east and west banks of the Luan River. This morning, the enemy fired artillery at our positions on the east bank of the river in a scattered manner, all missing. This morning, another enemy plane came and circled back and forth low over Luan County for reconnaissance four times, without dropping any bombs. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>More Than 30,000 Refugees Reach Tangshan</p>
<p>(Beiping) People from Tangshan say that in the past few days, more than 30,000 refugees have successively fled to Tangshan. Hotels and households are overcrowded, and most are sheltering the old and young, lodging in the open air. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Many Residents of Changli Injured by Bombing</p>

<p>Japanese Army Plans to Cross the Luan River and Invade the West</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to sources, after the Japanese army occupied five counties including Luandong, Linyu, Qian'an, Changli, and Funing, they are preparing to cross the Luan River and invade westward. They are now making comprehensive plans for military, political, and diplomatic aspects, and will take military action after the preparations are complete. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Heavy Casualties on Both Sides</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zunhua reports that at dawn today, 400 to 500 enemy cavalry attempted to cross the Luan River from Dacheng Yu and Sangshuyu, and another 300 or so infantry crossed the river from Changhe Yu, intending to encircle our Nantuanting and Beituanting. Our army fought bravely and engaged the enemy in fierce battles. As of a little after 9:00 AM, they were still attacking fiercely. Since the contact on the 12th, there have been fierce battles every day. Our army has suffered casualties to date, and the enemy's casualties are double that number. In total, the enemy has shelled our positions with more than 5,000 artillery shells in these few days, and the fierceness of the fighting can be imagined. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>More Than 30,000 Refugees in Luanzhou</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 7th and 8th trains on the Beining Railway are still running to Luanzhou. There are approximately more than 30,000 refugees in Luanzhou, and they are currently being transported to Beiping, Tianjin, and other places by trains on the Beining Railway. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Japanese Planes Drop Absurd Leaflets</p>
<p>(Beiping) A Japanese plane flew from Luandong to Tangshan, Kaiping Majiagou, Kailuan mining area, and Qujiazhuang, Zhaojiazhuang, Xiazhuangzi, and other places from a height of 2,000 meters for reconnaissance for about thirty minutes, and scattered thousands of yellow, absurd leaflets. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>He Yingqin Telegraphs Jiang to Go North</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin sent an urgent telegram to Chairman Jiang on the 18th, reporting the situation at the front. It is said that Jiang is preparing to go north again in three to five days, first to Baoding. The Japanese army, seeing that our defense line on the west bank of the Luan River is solid, intends to change its route of attack. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Nantuanting and Beituanting Lost and Regained Twice</p>
<p>(Beiping) Inside Xifengkou, enemy and our forces were still confronting each other between Saheqiao and Santunying on the evening of the 18th at Nantuanting and Beituanting. There were approximately 4,000 to 5,000 enemies there, who crossed the river twice and engaged in hand-to-hand combat with our forces. The Song army used all its strength to resist the enemy. As a result of the fierce fighting on the afternoon of the 18th, they were lost and regained twice. The enemy army was finally repelled to the east of the river, and they are now facing each other across the river. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Miao's Division Safely Reaches the West Bank of the River</p>
<p>(Beiping) Miao's division, withdrawn from Jielingkou, safely arrived on the west bank of the Luan River west of Lulong last night, joining forces with the Shang division. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>Puppet Organization Plans to Take Over Customs</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet organization is preparing to send personnel to take over the Qinhuangdao Customs. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Beiping Military Council Discusses Important Military Cases</h3>
<p>Anti-Japanese Military Supplies to be Shared Equally by All Provinces</p>
<p>Military Pay for All North China Armies to be Paid Once a Month</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Council held a routine meeting at 10:00 AM this morning, chaired by He Yingqin, to discuss plans for military deployments on both sides of the Luan River. The meeting lasted for two hours. Yu Xuezhong came to Beiping this morning to attend the Military Council's routine meeting and is scheduled to return to Tianjin tonight. Pang Bingxun also came to Beiping to attend the Military Council meeting. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong returns to Tianjin this midnight. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In the past, military pay for all armies in North China was calculated at 36 days per month and paid ten times per army each month due to financial difficulties. Because of the difficulty in calculating the dates, at this morning's Military Council meeting, a member proposed that the pay should still be paid according to twelve months, while taking into account the financial situation, that is, dividing the total amount of these ten months into twelve parts and paying them twelve times. After discussion, the principle was approved. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong previously submitted a report to the Military Council, stating that in Ji Province, banditry and disasters have occurred repeatedly. Last year, Liu Guitang's bandit troops fled north, attaching themselves to more than a dozen counties including Pingdeng, causing severe disturbances. The communist activities in the Lixian area were especially unsettling. Since the Rehe War, the counties along the Great Wall and in Luandong have been supplying hundreds of thousands of troops with the resources of only a few counties. From December of the Ji army to the middle of March of this year, the province collected more than 14,500 large carts and more than 4,000 mules and horses, most of which have not been returned. The conscription of laborers has also reached 60,000. The supply funds have exceeded 20 million. The fields are barren, and the supplies are exhausted. Moreover, it is the time of spring plowing, and it is impossible to sow seeds, so the livelihood of the future is even more unimaginable. In accordance with the military supply of anti-Japanese military, the country should cooperate together. Special relief should be requested. The Military Council has decided to forward it to the Military Affairs Committee, requesting that the anti-Japanese military supply be borne equally by all provinces. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Wang Jingwei Talks About Jiang's Current Difficulty in Going North</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain reporter met with President Wang at the Central Party Headquarters on the morning of the 19th and asked whether Chairman Jiang would go north to preside over military affairs. Wang replied that Chairman Jiang's task of suppressing the Communists in Jiangxi is as important as resisting Japan. The gradual elimination of the Jiangxi Communists depends entirely on Chairman Jiang sitting in town and suppressing them with determination, so as not to allow them to spread. Although resisting Japan is the most urgent task at present, if Jiang goes north, the Communists will take the opportunity to invade the provinces along the Yangtze River, resulting in worries about the rear. Therefore, Chairman Jiang will probably find it difficult to go north for the time being. Central Committee member Wang Qi said that since the abolition of the North China Political Affairs Committee, all political issues have been directly instructed by the Central Government, but it is quite inconvenient. This issue has now been handed over to the Central Standing Committee for handling. In the future, it will still be a committee system, or the Central Government will send a special envoy to handle it, which has not yet been decided. (19th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>China Eastern Railway Dispute</h3>
<p>Puppet Organization Acts High-Handed</p>
<p>Unreasonable Reply to Russian Protest</p>
<p>Japanese Puppets Cut Off Eurasian Transportation</p>
<p>Lude Asks the Board of Directors for Instructions</p>
<p>Tokyo Government Takes the Position of a Third Country</p>
<p>Japanese Telegraph Relays that Four Locomotives Have Been Returned to Russia</p>
<p>(Changchun) The puppet Manchukuo, in the name of Li Shaogeng, the director of the China Eastern Railway, issued a rebuttal on the 19th to the Soviet government's protest, with the following main points: 1. The Soviet Union's detention of vehicles is a unilateral illegal act that cannot be tolerated. 2. The interpretation of the regulations of the China Eastern Railway is completely different between the "Manchukuo" and Soviet authorities. 3. The Russian side's detention of vehicles violates the spirit of joint management of the China Eastern Railway. 4. The Soviet government should consider the China Eastern Railway as the highest body jointly managed by "Man" and Russia, and should be managed on an equal footing. 5. In order to establish the above spirit, Manchuria has implemented necessary measures. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Sources in Boriz report that, regarding the issue of "Man" Japanese police officers forcibly cutting off railway traffic between Europe and the Far East, the China Eastern Railway Director Lude has asked the China Eastern Railway Board of Directors for instructions on the measures that the railway should take, as the China Eastern Railway is also a part of the international railway agreement. According to the report, "Man" police and Japanese officials recently forcibly cut off the connection between the China Eastern Railway and the Outer Baikal Railway at Manchuria Li, the western end of the China Eastern Railway, completely blocking European and Asian passenger and freight traffic. This move has aroused inquiries from the Henneberg German Railway Management Office. Lude has asked the China Eastern Railway Board of Directors for instructions on this basis. The "Man"'s forcible obstruction of traffic has become a matter of concern to the China Eastern Railway Board of Directors. (19th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Soviet side later returned 30 to 40 China Eastern Railway freight cars to (puppet) Manchukuo for several consecutive days. On the 17th, four locomotives were returned at the Manchuria Li border. This was a concession by the Soviet side because it perceived the strong attitude of (puppet) Manchukuo and softened its stance. (19th Dentsu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government views the China Eastern Railway dispute as a local incident between Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo" and hopes that it can be resolved locally. However, the Japanese Foreign Ministry spokesman stated this morning that the Army Ministry has ordered the Kwantung Army to monitor the "Manchukuo" authorities to handle the case fairly. As for the note that Soviet Russia sent to Japan, the Japanese government will reply with its opinions. However, this case should be resolved by Soviet Russia and "Manchukuo", so Japan is not in a position to make any guarantees. The spokesman also mentioned Soviet Russia's preparation to sell the China Eastern Railway, saying that when Hirota was the ambassador to Russia, he discussed the matter with Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Karakhan. Hirota made this move without seeking approval from the Japanese government, so the Japanese government did not approve it. Recently, Tokyo received an official report stating that Karakhan has now indicated to Japanese Ambassador Ota that if the Chinese government is willing to purchase the railway, Soviet Russia is prepared to consider selling it.

<p>(Tokyo) According to confidential reports, the Japanese Army Ministry recently telegraphed its garrison troops in China, saying that China is urgently seeking to adopt an offensive posture in diplomacy, which will hinder all actions of the empire.

At present, we can only take advantage of the extreme inconsistencies among their leaders to engage in discord, so that their conflicts are endless, so that the empire can have the opportunity to defeat them one by one.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>What is the Future of Our Nation? How Shall We Conduct Ourselves? Qi.</h3>
<p>Since 1930, our country has been afflicted by floods, followed by the invasion of the violent Japanese. Internal strife is rife, compounded by the increasing foreign aggression. Natural and man-made disasters, internal and external troubles – virtually every perilous and difficult situation in human history is present, and all are serious. As a result, those who worry about the times mostly feel a sense of sinking, while optimists see it as a symbol of the arrival of a new era. What is the future of our nation? How shall we conduct ourselves? This is truly one of the most serious issues facing us today.</p>
<p>The paths to national salvation, as seen in historical records, are numerous. But they can be broadly categorized into two: achieving order through order, and achieving order through chaos. Bismarck's iron-fisted politics, the Meiji Restoration's pursuit of strength, and Mussolini's reactionary dictatorship all represent achieving order through order. Washington's revolutionary independence, Lenin's elimination of classes, and Kemal's resistance against foreign powers all represent achieving order through chaos. In essence, whether it involves mobilizing troops and sacrificing lives for external resistance or internal revolution, it all represents a form of upheaval for the nation. Extreme upheaval leads to accelerated natural selection. Unsuitable systems and things are swept away. Once external and internal contradictions are resolved, a desire for order re-emerges. Social order naturally returns to stability. Then, there is time for measured reconstruction, and order is achieved. Conversely, if systemic contradictions are not obvious and social ills are not deep, legislative correction is still possible. Or, if people are already tired of chaos but destructive actions have not ended, peaceful reconstruction will be more easily accepted. Thus, social order is maintained by political labor, and systemic contradictions are eased by legislative means, leading to order through gradual progress.</p>
<p>Can China's current contradictions still be resolved through reconciliation and correction? Can China's current social ills still be cured with temporary fixes? Specifically, can the conflict between China and Japan be resolved through evasive and temporizing means? Can the uprisings caused by rural bankruptcy be quelled through appeasement and suppression? Can the anger of the youth and the passion of the soldiers be calmed with a single order? Can the surging world tide and the shift in people's thinking be subtly changed with half a book of Analects and a few maxims? Regarding all these questions, it is feared that the authorities cannot give affirmative answers. Therefore, the path to national salvation for the Chinese nation will inevitably tend towards achieving order through chaos. This may already be the dominant trend. This is why the authorities cannot but repeatedly call for resistance against Japan.</p>
<p>If resistance against Japan is limited to the passive tactic of "fighting when the enemy comes," if resistance is spoken of without explicitly declaring war, if resistance is not immediately placing the entire nation in a state of war, and if resistance merely orders people to be calm and maintain order, will this reduce the contradictions of the current system? Will it satisfy the fervent hopes of the people? It is impossible to tell children to continue reading calmly when bandits are at the door, or to expect mothers and sisters-in-law to continue weaving as usual when flames enter the house. Since chaos has already arrived, one cannot speak of order again. To achieve order through chaos requires a way to manage chaos. The methods of peacetime are difficult to apply to managing chaos.</p>
<p>Speaking of resistance, the order of internal stability versus external resistance becomes a problem. If a firm determination to resist Japan is made, morale will be boosted and the people will rejoice. In a single shift, the nation's vitality will be evident. This is the argument for prioritizing external resistance over internal stability. First, internal peace is needed to ensure long-term resistance. Clearing internal disturbances is necessary to solidify the military's resolve to resist Japan. This is the argument that internal stability must precede external resistance. Ever since "the decline of Confucius," the Confucian classics have lost their effectiveness. For every issue, both sides can make a reasonable argument. If the confusion between right and wrong is like this, what is the path to follow? The answer is: worldly facts are most eloquent, and the general trend is irresistible. Must external resistance precede internal stability? Or must internal stability precede external resistance? We should judge based on the facts and deduce based on the general trend.</p>

<h3>British Engineer Espionage Case</h3>
<p>Moscow Court Announces Sentence</p>
<p>MacDonald Sentenced to Two Years, Thornton Three Years</p>
<p>Gregory Acquitted, Remaining Three Deported</p>
<p>Russian Defendants Sentenced to Ten Years to One and a Half Years</p>
<p>Britain to Ban Russian Imports Next Week</p>
<p>Russian Trade Representative Prepares to Leave London</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 18th – The Soviet Russian court tonight released the verdict in the case of seventeen British and Russian employees of Vickers Company accused of espionage, sabotage, and bribery. The verdict was as follows: Mönckton, the Vickers manager in Russia, was deported; Thornton, the deputy manager, was sentenced to three years of imprisonment; MacDonald, a British engineer, was sentenced to two years of imprisonment; British engineers Knische and Nordwall were deported; British engineer Gregory was acquitted; of the eleven Russian defendants, except for Shcherbakov, who was acquitted, the rest were sentenced to imprisonment, with three each sentenced to ten years and eight years respectively, and one each sentenced to five years, three years, two years, and one and a half years.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 19th – Of the six British defendants, only Thornton and MacDonald are currently in detention and will be transferred to Lubyanka Prison today.</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 10th – The judges presiding over the Vickers Company employee case retired from the court at 3:30 PM to deliberate on the verdict. According to Russian custom, the presiding judge must personally write out his opinion and the verdict for the entire case. For over five hours, the judges remained in a private room next to the courtroom in deliberation. Hundreds of spectators wandered about the courthouse, eager to rush into the courtroom at the sound of the bell to hear the outcome of this bizarre seven-day trial. The courthouse refreshment room did brisk business, and nearly all of its stored food was sold out. Many spectators played cards, dice, or read newspapers to pass the time. Meanwhile, the British defendants and British Embassy personnel sat in a special room next to the courtroom. Knische appeared to be the most composed, falling asleep after dinner, confident of his acquittal. Soviet troops were stationed around the courthouse to prevent public gatherings, and armed police carefully checked courtroom entry passes. It was learned tonight that the Soviet authorities had paid the Vickers Company 30,000 pounds for the amount due last Saturday and Sunday. It is generally believed that the payment issue will not be affected by this case, as the Soviet Union has already stated that the accused are employees of Vickers Company, not Vickers Company itself. At 12:55 AM, the judges finally reappeared in court. The presiding judge spoke in a calm tone, reiterating various documents, stating that Thornton was the mastermind, and Mönckton was also involved with Thornton. As the presiding judge was about to finish speaking, the entire court was silent, and all the defendants held their breath. After the verdict was announced, the listeners were surprised by the leniency of the sentences. According to Russian opinion, such sentences often receive clemency in the past.</p>
<h3>Thornton and MacDonald Appeal the Decision</h3>
<p>National News, Moscow, 19th – Of the five Vickers Company British engineers who were sentenced, Thornton, who was originally sentenced to three years of imprisonment, and MacDonald, who was sentenced to two years of imprisonment, have decided to appeal to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Union to request a reduction in their sentences. Whether the remaining three will appeal has not been decided today.</p>
<p>Knische and Others Depart Russia</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 18th – Those who have been ordered to be deported must leave the country within three days, starting from noon today. When Mönckton, Nordwall, and Knische left the courtroom, they were instructed by the court to sign a pledge to comply. These three are scheduled to depart Russia tonight, and Gregory, who was acquitted, will accompany them. Mönckton told Reuters reporters that Thornton and MacDonald did not have a chance to say goodbye to them in the courtroom before they were escorted to prison by bailiffs. Mönckton visited them in prison in the afternoon. They were naturally happy to be free but were saddened by the misfortune of their two colleagues being imprisoned. They had no words for each other except to wish each other well. Vickers Company legal counsel Donner advised those who were released not to criticize the trial, as it would be unwise to express opinions at this time. Those who were released all said that what they needed most was a good 24 hours of sleep. Mönckton said that he did not know who would be the company's representative in Russia after he left but that there was no reason to believe that the company's business in Russia would be affected by this case. There are still nine company employees who are not involved in this case, and they will remain in Russia to await further instructions. The issue of appealing for the Russian employees is currently under consideration and has not been decided. The three deported British citizens and Gregory will arrive in London within three days and will first contact the company upon arrival.</p>
<p>Britain to Implement Ban on Russian Goods</p>
<p>National News, London, 19th – This morning, the British King signed a proclamation placing 80% of Soviet Russian goods under import prohibition, including timber, kerosene, grains, raw cotton, and butter. It will be implemented on the 26th of this month, giving the Soviet Union only a week's advance notice.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – A Privy Council meeting was held at Windsor Palace at 9:30 AM this morning, attended by Lord President of the Council Baldwin and Foreign Secretary Simon, to discuss the declaration of a ban on Russian imports. The meeting was quite short, lasting only fifteen minutes. Baldwin and Simon then returned to London by car. It is now known that the proclamation banning Russian imports has been signed and will be published in the London Gazette tonight.</p>
<p>National News Agency, London, 18th – Since the British Foreign Office announced that the government had scheduled a Privy Council meeting at Windsor Palace on Wednesday morning to discuss issuing a proclamation banning Russian imports, it is heard that the Soviet Russian trade representative has prepared to leave the country. According to a spokesperson for the Soviet Russian Embassy, the British Foreign Office has notified them that the diplomatic immunity enjoyed by the Russian trade representative will end at midnight.</p>
<p>British Government and Public Are Quite Indignant</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 18th – After the verdict in the case of the six British engineers in Russia was announced tonight, there was widespread indignation throughout Britain. In the afternoon, the responsible parties stated in a letter that Britain could not accept any verdict that imprisoned British citizens. Now that the results of Thornton being sentenced to three years and MacDonald to two years have been announced, an official statement has been issued stating that a Privy Council meeting will be convened at Windsor Palace on Wednesday to authorize the government to issue a proclamation regarding the ban on Russian imports. Vickers Company has also formally announced that the company will consider its position in light of the Moscow court's verdict tomorrow, stating that the company has always fully trusted the conduct of its employees in Russia. The company cannot believe the evidence presented by the Russian court, and its sole concern now is the safety of its employees in Russia. Once the company's legal representative returns to Britain from the Russian capital, the company will issue a detailed statement outlining the details of the case from beginning to end. Tonight, British Foreign Secretary Simon and several key officials gathered at the Foreign Office to await the Moscow verdict. Upon receiving the telegram, they immediately notified British Prime Minister MacDonald by radio, who was en route to the United States. London evening newspapers all released special editions carrying Reuters' urgent dispatches to various locations. The Anglo-Russian trade agreement expired yesterday, but the old agreement remains in effect until the government decides to terminate relations between the two countries or reopen negotiations on a new agreement.</p>
<p>Prime Minister MacDonald Does Not Criticize During Journey</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – British Prime Minister MacDonald, en route to the United States by ship, received a wireless report from London regarding the Moscow case and declined to comment on the verdict. When Foreign Secretary Simon left the Foreign Office, he was asked for his opinion on the case, but Simon also declined to make any statement.</p>
<p>British Newspapers Denounce the Unfairness of the Original Verdict</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 19th – London morning newspapers have mostly published editorials or cartoons denouncing the unfairness of the Moscow case. However, The Times and the Daily Express only reported the facts. The Daily Telegraph stated that the British government must do everything in its power to overturn the verdict. If the Soviet Union does not immediately overturn the original verdict, the government must consider adopting any plan it can. The Daily Mail stated that even if Soviet justice were to overturn the deportation verdict, the British government's handling of this matter has been consistently strong, and if further action is necessary, the entire nation will fully support the cabinet. The Liberal Party newspaper News Chronicle stated that the sentences received by MacDonald and Thornton were comparatively lenient, indicating that with appropriate negotiations, the Soviet Union may be willing to overturn them, but intimidation would be useless, and the ban on Russian imports would be not only useless but also harmful. The Daily Mirror advocated a tough response, stating that even the suspension of trade relations would not be enough to appease public anger, but the nation must patiently await the government to explain its policy.</p>
<p>American Newspapers Say the Soviet Union Is Not a Paradise</p>
<p>Reuters, New York, 19th – The New York Evening Post criticized the Moscow trial of British engineers at Vickers Electrical Company, stating that the Russian authorities were able to coerce the Russian managers protected by diplomatic authority of British factories, to satisfy their selfish goals. Russia is truly not a place for Americans to reside.</p>
<h3>American Congress Suspends Debate on Silver Bills</h3>
<p>To Wait for International Financial Agreement to be Established</p>
<p>Then Propose New Ways to Inflate Currency</p>
<p>Silver Movement Has Not Reached Its Final Fate</p>
<p>Roosevelt Announces Restoration of Gold Embargo</p>
<p>Reuters, Washington, 19th – President Roosevelt announced today the restoration of the gold embargo.</p>
<p>National News, Washington, 18th – Today, debate on various silver bills was suddenly abandoned in the American Congress. For example, Senator Long withdrew his bill to issue silver certificates, and Senator Thomas also withdrew a similar amendment. Furthermore, there was no renewed effort to reopen debate on other silver bills providing supplemental rural relief. As for the House of Representatives, the Rules Committee has submitted a report advocating changes to procedures to prevent any silver plan from being considered early. This move is clearly based on President Roosevelt's proposal, but the truth of the matter has not been made public. Although the President opposes discussing the silver bills together with the rural relief bill, he has not publicly opposed the contents of the bills. Therefore, the final fate of the silver movement is still uncertain. After the Senate abandoned debate today, it was heard that the President had planned to meet with several inflationists tonight. It is speculated that the President will postpone any inflation plans in Congress until after he has consulted with the British and French envoys on the financial situation. Meanwhile, the Treasury Department is continuing to revise its gold embargo plan to maintain the international gold price. It has also issued passports authorizing Chase National Bank and Guaranty Trust Company to continue shipping gold abroad. As a result, Guaranty Trust Company shipped another $300,000 in gold today, and Chase National Bank will ship the same amount on Friday.</p>
<p>National News, Washington, 18th – Today, U.S. House Speaker Rayburn stated that if Congress adopts any currency inflation plan, its contents will be significantly different from existing bills and will be supported by the government. Rayburn made this statement after the Senate abandoned debate on various silver bills. Although the White House has not yet made any statement, it is heard that the President is currently studying various currency inflation proposals and discussing them in detail with his economic advisors. Therefore, he can guarantee that there will be some form of currency inflation in the United States, but if it is proposed to Congress, it must be a purely Democratic bill advocated by the government. The issue of currency inflation has become the most notable event in Washington, D.C. It is generally expected that the government will propose a currency inflation method within a month, but its date will be after the President consults with representatives of major European countries. After the President consulted with Senators Thomas and Byrns today, no official news was released. Observers of the situation and representatives of financial institutions remaining in the capital expressed disappointment. There are rumors tonight that the Treasury Department will effectively lift the gold embargo within a few days and that the Treasury Department will no longer issue passports for gold exports. It is also rumored that Britain has purchased 4 million pounds of gold bars, and the gold for which export passports were issued today is intended to be shipped to France. However, apart from these rumors, there is no official news. The Treasury Department has also made no statement regarding the gold export. As for the current attitude of the American public, agricultural organizations and silver-producing states are strongly pushing for currency inflation, while industrial states generally oppose it. Banks and merchants holding U.S. government bonds are strongly opposed. The attitude of the legislators is still unknown.</p>

<h3>Britain and the United States Plan to Unify Currency System</h3>
<p>German Financial Circles Express Doubt</p>
<p>National News, Berlin, 18th – This office has received reports that the United States has a plan to establish a unified currency system between Britain and the United States, that is, to mix the use of the pound sterling and the U.S. dollar. German financial circles have speculated a lot after hearing this news, but regarding this matter, opinions of doubt still exist. Furthermore, this office believes that the United States, in order to allow the United Kingdom to strengthen its pound position, is willing to make huge concessions on tariffs, but London still believes that the consolidation of the gold pound is not yet the time.</p>
<h3>Austrian Prime Minister's Visit to Rome Successful</h3>
<p>National News, Vienna, 19th – Austrian Prime Minister Dollfuss returned here from Italy today and immediately sent a telegram to Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, thanking him for the warm hospitality he received in Italy and saying that Austria is very fortunate to be able to have Italy's friendship and support forever, as in the past. Dollfuss also met with reporters today, and in his conversation, he expressed that this trip to Italy was a complete success. Dollfuss also discussed the treaty of friendship signed between Austria and Italy three years ago. He said that this treaty is not only a formal expression between countries, and based on the impression he received in Italy, Mussolini also attached great importance to the treaty. Therefore, Dollfuss believes that this trip to Italy has found a good friend in Southern Europe who can provide assistance at any time and maintain Austria's independence and neutrality.</p>
<h3>Polish-Danzig Relations Tense</h3>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 18th – Relations between Poland and Danzig have become tense again. It is reported that the Polish diplomatic representative in Danzig directly sent a letter to the League of Nations' office in Danzig, expressing his opinion on the deterioration of Danzig's security situation, stating that the police are currently unable to deal with violence, and certain political groups are acting arbitrarily without fear of punishment.

<p>Reuters Moscow Correspondence – Soviet Russian transportation design committee engineer, Waldler, has recently invented a train that uses electric motors, averaging one hundred and fifty miles per hour. The train runs on a single track, with overhead wires. It is said that the nature of the train is the same as the American elevated railway, but slightly more advanced because it is faster and does not require many building materials. The model has already been tested, and the results are excellent.</p>
<h3>To the Front Lines at Xifengkou</h3>
<p>Special Correspondent Geng Ya of This Newspaper</p>
<p>Zunhua Correspondence, At six o'clock on the morning of the fourteenth, departing from the transportation office of the civilian support association of Liaoning, Jilin, and Heilongjiang provinces stationed in Beiping. The association had four trucks, in addition to carrying a portion of the comfort goods, there were also more than twenty members of the fourth detachment of the propaganda corps of the Military Affairs Commission. A mighty and vigorous expedition, driving out of Chaoyangmen, heading straight northeast, in the rumbling sound of the car and the dusty mist, looking back at the old capital, I could not help but feel a sense of "the wind is rustling, the Yi River is cold." After about twenty miles, the road became rugged, and a strong wind stirred up dust, almost obscuring the sky. Although the drivers used their horns to maintain distance, on a bend by a clear pool, the lead car almost crashed head-on with a military vehicle of the 44th Division. The second car took the opportunity to drive ahead, reaching Baimiao, about sixty miles from Beiping, and waiting for half an hour before the remaining cars arrived. There is a clear stream in this place, with willows swaying by the side, and two or three thatched huts, with proclamations of the 29th Army from January and the 26th Army from April posted on them. They describe the treatment of the civilians sent by the various counties, with provisions of four yuan and five jiao for food per month for each civilian, and six yuan for each animal. A grass bridge (made of wood frames covered with sorghum stalks and then covered with soil) is built over the stream, with a wooden sign planted at the end of the bridge, which reads, "Orderly National Salvation, large vehicles please go to the left." After another few miles, in the clouds and mist of dust, one could vaguely see mule carts and vehicles, intermittently, numbering about two hundred. Mule and camel teams were in the vanguard, with seventy or eighty animals, all loaded with supplies and tools such as baskets and shovels for construction. It was said that they had set out from Beiping in the middle of the night, and the farmers driving the vehicles were all happily and without complaints, so there were few supervising officers or soldiers to be seen. Just as the vehicles were not giving way to each other, two trucks carrying wounded soldiers drove head-on, each carrying seven or eight wounded soldiers. Afterward, more than forty carts continued to arrive, each carrying three or four people, indicating the tension of the recent fighting at the front. Arriving at Sanhe, the "eastern fortress of Jingdong", just as we stopped, we suddenly saw several military officers walking into a school. The one at the head, tall and imposing, looked like Brigade Commander Wang Yizhe, whom the reporter had met when inspecting the Northeast two years ago. Now Wang had been promoted to commander of the 67th Army and was stationed at Gubeikou. How could he be here? Asking his entourage, it was indeed him. I offered my regards, and he insisted on a meeting and introduced Huang Yong'an, the chief of staff, and other personnel one by one. He said that he was here to meet with Weng Zhaoyuan and some important officials, and that his army would also be transferred to a certain place and was currently mobilizing. He asked the reporter for a copy of "Reminiscences of the Bloody Battle of Shanghai". The reporter happened to have one with him for reading on the way, and presented it to him, with the inscription "Wishing the General that his future anti-Japanese history will be even more glorious than this page" on the inner page of "Reminiscences of the Bloody Battle of Shanghai". We said goodbye with "See you at the front" and parted. Around twelve o'clock, we arrived at Jixian. There was a garrison regiment, a wounded soldier comfort group, and a wounded soldier reception center. The Beiping People's Self-Defense Guidance Committee's diagrams for escaping from airplane bombing, Nankai School's comfort team and rescue team slogans, the Jixian County Women's Comfort Group's announcements for raising materials and donations, and the newly posted slogans and leaflets of the accompanying propaganda team, all sorts of things, actually managed to attract the residents to watch. Those who were illiterate asked the literate to read aloud, and after reading and listening, they mostly muttered to themselves, "The southern army still hasn't come, and the planes don't say anything." So they gathered with excitement and dispersed with disappointment. Continuing forward, the grooms delivering grain took off their fur robes and even had to bare their chests to face the wind. There was no other reason, it was because of the strange hot weather on the border in late spring, with cold mornings and evenings and scorching heat near noon. Travelers at this time, with dry mouths and parched tongues, and no hope of plums, could find tea places set up by the YMCA or the villagers along the way, where they could raise a cup to quench their thirst. Although it was only a cup of clear tea, it was enough to express the sincerity of the people's welcome. Drinking it, we could not help but feel ashamed that we had nothing to repay them. Before long, we reached Shimen Town, where the communications team of the 106th Division of the 53rd Army was stationed. There were no guards or flags at the team's station, only a small orderly sweeping horse manure inside the gate. Talking to him, one could see the soldiers lying prostrate in the backyard, basking in the sun, visible through the cracks in the screen. The orderly described the battle of Rehe, how the division had won at first, and then, influenced by the retreat of Ding's brigade, the entire line retreated in disarray, without eating or sleeping, for five days and nights, finally rushing to Xifengkou. His words were filled with pride, boasting of his speed in avoiding the enemy's pursuit. Asking about his army commander, he said it was Wan Fulin, and the reporter only said, "So that's how it is." The soldier also inquired with concern about whether the 19th Route Army was coming. The sun gradually set in the west, gradually losing its light, as white as the moon, large and surpassing it, and as it was about to be swallowed by the vast earth, it presented a unique feature that was unseen in the southern scenery, which could not be described by pen and ink. At that time, covered in dust and fatigue, we finally reached our destination for the day, Zunhua. The county is one hundred and ten miles from Xifengkou, only eighty miles from Sahe, the recent concentration point for attacks and bombings by the Japanese army, and only twenty miles from Luowenyu, which has been captured by the enemy several times, and only three hundred miles from Beiping in the rear, so it is a key location. On the eighth and ninth, enemy planes came several times to drop bombs, and the busy shops and stores in the northern part of the city were mostly hit. At that time, vehicles transporting supplies were crowding here, killing seven people and three mules and horses, and injuring more than ten people. Including other places, more than ten people had died and more than thirty had been injured. The wooden planks of the shops were covered with bomb scars, as dense as a beehive. Passersby often stopped to watch. From then on, the residents of each household dug cellars to avoid airplanes, and before three o'clock every day, they scattered to the countryside, and from four o'clock, they opened the market and operated until eight or nine o'clock in the morning. The headquarters of the 29th Army is located at , but the main people are actually located elsewhere, a different world. The cooperation between the army and the people is like a family, the villagers told each other like this, and the reporter carefully observed that it was indeed the case. Among the villagers, there was a person named Xu Shaomin, who insisted on inviting the reporter to his home, and said that although the 29th Army was brave and good at fighting, if it persisted for a long time, it would inevitably be exhausted. There was no support coming, what could they do? To go to the Xifengkou war zone, one had to travel at night to be able to do so. Permission had been obtained from the military headquarters, and it could be done within a day.</p>

<h3>Shortening the Defense Line in Eastern Luan</h3>
<p>(Special Correspondent) Da.</p>
<p>Changes Also Occurring on the Xifeng Front Line</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: Since the Japanese army's invasion of the various passes of the Great Wall, our army has been fighting with all its might. In the Battle of Xifeng, the enemy's advance was severely thwarted. The enemy, realizing that it was difficult to invade from that direction, switched to attacking the eastern front. After several intense battles at Shimen and Haiyang, the enemy launched another fierce attack on Lengkou. After Lengkou fell, the enemy turned back to attack Xifeng on one side, and pressed towards eastern Luan on the other. Our army's front line wavered and had to reorganize its position in accordance with the changing war situation. The enemy that invaded Lengkou and Jianchang moved west towards Qian'an and Lulong. Since Qian'an county town had no defensible terrain, our troops in that area temporarily withdrew west of the Luan River to defend it. Yesterday, the majority had concentrated in Xujiayuan. Lulong was defended by Weng Zhaoyuan's troops, who have been engaged in fierce battles with the enemy for days, suffering heavy casualties. More than ten Japanese aircraft repeatedly bombed Lulong county town, destroying much of the town's vital sections. Residents fled to Luanzhou and Tangshan. Japanese aircraft have been scouting and bombing Luanzhou daily, destroying many bridges and houses, and the situation is becoming increasingly tense. This morning, three more Japanese aircraft came to Luanzhou to scout and bombed Anshan. With the outbreak of fighting in Qian'an and Lulong, Luanzhou is feeling the threat. Because the front line of the eastern front troops was too long, and there was a risk of the rear lines of communication being cut off, the defense line was shortened the day before yesterday. The troops around Haiyang first withdrew to Liushouying. The troops stationed around Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe are also gradually concentrating in Changli and Luanzhou. Japanese and puppet troops invaded Qinhuangdao the day before yesterday. Qinhuangdao Station and North Street were bombed by Japanese aircraft, resulting in heavy losses. British and American Marines landed to protect foreign nationals. Three Japanese armored trains arrived at Qinhuangdao the day before yesterday (15th) afternoon. Yesterday (16th), two trains entered Beidaihe Station and continued westward. Villages near Qinhuangdao and Beidaihe were looted by Japanese and puppet troops. Yesterday afternoon, the Japanese army arrived at Liushouying and opened fire on our army's positions around Zhangzhuang and Changli, and dispatched many aircraft to bomb along the Beining Line, destroying the tracks east of Changli. Fighting broke out near Changli this morning. The puppet army of Li Jichun, numbering over two thousand, that invaded Funing, also advanced towards Changli. Plainclothes troops were also spotted near Shimen Station, west of Changli. A Japanese armored train has arrived at Changli Station. Changli and Shimen are in the midst of a chaotic battle, and telegraph communications have been disrupted. Trains Nos. 101, 101102, etc. on the Beining Railway only ran to Tangshan today (17th). East of Tangshan, the area is crowded with military vehicles. The situation in eastern Luan has changed greatly. The Japanese army appears to be advancing westward again. Our army is now west of the Luan River, setting up strong defensive positions, preparing to fight the enemy.</p>
<p>On the Xifengkou front, the enemy and our forces were originally facing each other across the mountains at the pass entrance, with the left and right flanks defending Dongjiakou and Panjiakou. Since Dongjiakou was invaded by the enemy, Lengkou fell one after another. The Japanese army concentrated its forces and launched attacks on multiple routes. The front line was subjected to heavy artillery bombardment, and the rear was attacked by Japanese troops. On the 13th, the front line position was abandoned, and the troops were concentrated around Luanyang, holding out against the enemy. The majority have already reached the right bank of the Luan River. Since the 13th, the enemy army has been attempting to cross the river under the cover of heavy artillery fire, but has been repelled each time. There has been fierce fighting near Luanyang for several days and nights, with heavy casualties on both sides. This morning, the Japanese army launched another multi-pronged attack on Luanyang, and the situation is extremely critical. Japanese troops have also been spotted in the Santunying area, and fierce fighting is underway. Zunhua has been repeatedly bombed by Japanese aircraft. Yutian, Jixian, and other places were also scouted by three Japanese aircraft yesterday. According to a message released by a military agency this morning, around 7:00 AM yesterday, approximately five or six hundred enemy troops attempted to cross the river stealthily. They were fiercely attacked by our side while they were halfway across, with over a hundred casualties drifting downstream. At 4:00 PM, over four hundred enemy troops who had crossed the river were surrounded and completely annihilated, with only a few survivors. At 6:00 AM the day before yesterday (15th), the enemy, under the cover of artillery fire and aircraft, forcibly crossed the river from the area to the right of Saheqiao, and the area around Nantuan and Beiting. Our defending soldiers met them head-on with fierce attacks, and the enemy was unable to withstand the attack and retreated to the opposite bank. Then at 9:00 AM, the enemy dispatched reinforcements of about a thousand troops, and launched a fierce attempt to cross the river. Our side resisted desperately, and one battalion commander and two company commanders were wounded, and the soldiers also suffered heavy casualties, causing Nantuan and Beiting to be briefly occupied by the enemy. Immediately, another unit was transferred and strictly ordered to retake them. They charged into the enemy's ranks at dusk last night (16th) and engaged in hand-to-hand combat for three hours, killing many enemies, and retook Nantuan and Beiting. Currently, the enemy on the front line is still continuously bombarding us with artillery fire. Several enemy aircraft are scouting along our position all day long and dropping heavy bombs.

<h3>Letters from the Front Lines</h3>
<p>Soldiers Filled with Patriotic Ideas</p>
<p>Continuous Stream of Public Comfort</p>
<p>Mr. Jiang Wenhan of the Tangshan Wounded Soldiers Hospital recently sent a letter reporting on the work situation on the battlefield. The letter said, "Our youth association service work at the Tangshan Military Hospital is now starting to take shape. The youth association room is equipped with many newspapers, pictorials, books, chess, checkers, military chess, promotion games, tea and phonographs. On the walls are charts and battle zone maps of educational value, etc. We also write letters for the wounded soldiers, prepare stationery and stamps. In the past three or four days, we have written more than a dozen letters every day. Some are sent to their families, some are sent to individuals, and some are reports on the injuries of company and platoon leaders."</p>
<p>A Family Letter</p>
<p>Yesterday, a wounded soldier received a letter from his mother, which read: "My son Mingshan, I only learned from your letter that you have gone to the front to fight against the inhumane Japanese imperialists. It is your duty to fight for the survival of the nation, even with a gun wound in your left arm. But I don't know how serious your injury is. Please write back quickly to let me know. Everyone at home is well, but we miss you very much. I hope you can come home to see us when you recover, to reassure the old and the young. The harvest was very bad last year. Our land is either being shared or rented out to others. The renters are not paying the rent. Because of insect and flood disasters, not much grain is being shared from the shared land. And in this spring famine season, taxes are piling up, and carts and mules are frequently requisitioned. The people in the village are all sighing and suffering. It is very difficult to maintain the family life. Your eldest brother is teaching at the Sanyu School in Yuci, Shanxi this year. Your fourth brother is still in the 4th Corps of Military Police in Jiaocheng, Shanxi. I hope you can come home to see us when you recover. Please, please. Your mother." This wounded soldier could not read, so he asked me to read it to him. As I read, I truly felt that every word was a tear. In the first paragraph, his mother encouraged him to fight for the country. The latter paragraph details the suffering of the villagers. This is our China, this is our compatriot. Who has no parents? It is truly infuriating to hear a mother say such things to her son.</p>
<p>Patriotic Young Men</p>
<p>Now, soldiers are much more knowledgeable than before. They know that they must love their country and do not want to be slaves to a conquered nation. Once injured, they still hope to get well soon and return to the front to fight the enemy. Family is not important, the country is important. When writing letters home, many wounded soldiers never mention their injuries to their parents, fearing that they will worry. I think, even if they are injured, they can still write a letter home to reassure their parents. If they die in battle on the front lines, they won't even have a letter to comfort their parents. How many young men have disappeared like this, silently and scentlessly.</p>
<p>Hospital Overview</p>
<p>This military hospital was established by the 　 Army Corps of North China. There are currently more than 400 wounded soldiers, mostly transported back from the front lines of Lengkou to Shimenzhai. This military hospital was opened very hastily, and is simple, but it is quite a large scale. The director, Zhang Feixian, is sincere and very serious about his work. The entire hospital currently has nine wards, each ward accommodating between forty and fifty wounded soldiers. Since its opening, people and organizations from all over have come to express their condolences, which can truly show the spirit of unity between the military and the people, and jointly overcoming national difficulties. The soldiers also deeply understand that this is a war against a foreign enemy, so many people come to express their condolences. If it were a civil war, I am afraid no one would care.</p>
<p>Very Welcome</p>
<p>The wounded soldiers are very welcome to the youth association. In addition to setting up a "Youth Association Room" in the hospital, we take turns visiting each ward every day to express our condolences and play phonographs. Many game equipment have been distributed to each ward for the enjoyment of those wounded soldiers who cannot move. We have also prepared a little meager condolence gift, and each wounded soldier receives a towel and a piece of soap. I also contacted the Engineering College of Jiaotong University, the Fourth Middle School, and Fengluan Middle School in this area, hoping that some students would be willing to come to each ward voluntarily to give speeches, write letters, and express their condolences to the wounded soldiers. Currently, in addition to me, Mr. Mao Jianting from Tianjin is also in charge of the Youth Association Room.</p>
<p>Showing Movies</p>
<p>Yesterday, Mr. Zhang Shouyi brought a movie projector from the Youth Association in Beiping to Tangshan. Last night and tonight, we showed the Lianhua Company's production "Jointly Overcoming National Difficulties" to the wounded soldiers in the hospital. While it was playing, we also played the phonograph. Sadly, many wounded soldiers have never seen a moving picture since they were born. Therefore, they are very grateful to the Youth Association. I hope that movies will often be shown in the war zone in the future, and be shown in rotation. If the Youth Association can provide the wounded soldiers with a kind of proper entertainment and instill in them a kind of personal education, then that would be our greatest contribution to this service in the war zone. General Shang Zhen.</p>
<p>This morning, I invited Mr. Zhang Shouyi to visit Shang Zhen in Kaiping. Kaiping is only eighteen miles from Tangshan, and it can be reached by train in ten minutes. After we arrived at the headquarters of the Army Corps, Commander Shang treated us very politely and invited us to have a meal. We then reported to him on the situation of the Youth Association at the Tangshan Military Hospital, and expressed our willingness to run youth association work for officers in Kaiping. He agreed very much. Commander Shang is a very energetic person. He has no bad habits and gets up early and goes to bed late every day. He handles all matters, large and small, personally. The officers and soldiers under his direct command are disciplined and are very popular with the people.</p>
<p>Front Line Needs</p>
<p>There are Youth Association war zone service workers on the front lines in six places: Tangshan, Zunhua, Miyun, Jixian, Tianjin, and Beiping. It is said that the wounded soldiers most welcome pictorials, such as Liangyou, Shidai, Zhonghua, etc., and novels.</p>
<h3>Lu Province Seeks Individuals with the Ability to Scale Walls</h3>
<p>Han Fuju Orders the National Arts Hall to Issue a Notice</p>
<p>Treat Them with the Courtesy of Honored Guests and Award Prizes</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The skills of flying over eaves and scaling walls, and striking acupuncture points are often seen in unofficial novels. The records in Tang Dynasty notes are even more miraculous. Han Fuju, Chairman of Lu Province, decided to hold a provincial national arts competition in Lu Province starting on May 14th. In order to seek out talents with the ability to fly over eaves and scale walls, and strike acupuncture points, he specially ordered the Provincial National Arts Examination Preparatory Committee to add a special skills category, and prepare prizes to treat them with the courtesy of honored guests. The Provincial National Arts Hall has issued a notice to solicit widely. It is conceivable that there are no lack of people with unique skills in the north and south of the Yangtze River. At that time, they should come to Jinan to show their skills together. The notice issued by the National Arts Hall is recorded as follows: "The first National Arts Examination in Shandong Province will be held on May 14th. Recently, the Provincial Chairman instructed that the skills of flying over eaves and scaling walls, and striking acupuncture points are inherent skills of our country. As it has been passed down to this day, it is gradually being lost. This provincial examination must add this category to promote lost learning. There are no restrictions on province of origin or qualifications. All are welcome to come to Lu to show their skills. Round-trip travel expenses, food, and lodging expenses will be borne by this museum, and there are also many prizes to be awarded as souvenirs. If you know of anyone with this skill, please introduce them widely. All special skills are welcome to come. Shandong Provincial National Arts Hall."</p>
<h3>National Salvation Movement of the Military and People of Sichuan Province</h3>
<p>Establishment of Provincial Aviation Salvation Associations in All Counties</p>
<p>Various Armies Agree on the Allocation of Troops to Resist Japan</p>
<p>Chongqing Correspondence: After the end of the Sichuan war, the various armies were busy expanding their strength and reorganizing their troops. Therefore, the situation in Sichuan has been slightly calmed down. However, the military and people of Sichuan Province have recently launched an aviation national salvation movement and a plan to send troops to resist Japan for the sake of national salvation, because the national crisis is becoming increasingly urgent. The situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>People Purchase One Hundred Aircraft</p>
<p>The people of Sichuan are inherently rich in patriotic spirit, but their mobilization has been delayed, mainly because they are located in the remote western frontier and transportation is inconvenient. Recently, people from all walks of life in Sichuan have established aviation national salvation associations. Chengdu has the Sichuan Provincial Aviation National Salvation Association, and various cities and counties have aviation national salvation branches. Sichuan has a total of one hundred and fifty-one cities and counties. Each city and county is preparing to raise donations to purchase one hundred new aircraft to use for resistance against Japan. Currently, the amount of funds raised has reached more than 3.5 million. It is heard that the Provincial Aviation National Salvation Association has a pre-determined plan to raise enough funds, up to 10 million yuan, and then send special personnel to foreign merchants to purchase aircraft and hand them over to the anti-Japanese army.</p>
<p>Dispatch 50,000 Troops to Resist Japan</p>
<p>The total number of troops in Sichuan is said to be 400,000, but in reality, it has now reached more than 500,000. Liu Xiang's army has more than 130,000, Liu Wenhui's army has more than 100,000, Tian Songyao's army has more than 70,000, Deng Xihou's army has more than 50,000, Yang Sen's army has more than 40,000, Liu Cunhou's Sichuan-Shaanxi Border Defense Army has more than 40,000, Li Jiayu's New Sixth Division has more than 40,000, and Luo Zezhou's 23rd Division has more than 30,000. Currently, Liu Xiang, Liu Wenhui, Deng Xihou, Tian Songyao, Yang Sen, Liu Cunhou, etc., are concerned that the national crisis is becoming increasingly tense. Various provinces are preparing to send troops to resist Japan, but Sichuan Province is still silent. Therefore, special letters and telegrams have been exchanged to discuss the matter of sending troops. It is heard that it has been determined that all the armies in Sichuan will dispatch a total of 50,000 troops, including 20,000 troops jointly dispatched by Liu Xiang and Liu Wenhui, and 30,000 troops jointly dispatched by Tian Songyao, Deng Xihou, Yang Sen, and Liu Cunhou. They will be dispatched to resist Japan at the appropriate time. As for the detailed rules for dispatching troops, they are being discussed in detail. (April 18th)</p>

<h3>Relief for Native Products in Shandong Province</h3>
<p>A large stockpile is accumulating in Qingdao, unable to be exported.</p>
<p>There are plans to request the Central Government to reduce customs duties.</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie and Jiaoji Railway Chairman Ge Guangting arrived in Jinan early on the 16th via the Jiaoji Railway. After disembarking, they immediately went to the Jiaoji Hotel to rest. According to Shen and Ge, the purpose of their trip is summarized as follows:</p>
<p>Shen Honglie stated:</p>
<p>"This trip to Jinan is specifically to discuss with Chairman Han the issue of relieving the export of native products from our province. The largest export products of our province are peanuts and peanut oil. The export destinations are Hong Kong and Europe. Currently, there are 5 million tons of peanuts and 2 million tons of peanut oil stockpiled in Qingdao, with a total value of 10 million yuan. Most of the merchants' capital is borrowed from banks. Now that the goods are stockpiled and unsold, the cost is accumulating, and bank loan interest is increasing daily. If they are forced to sell, the selling price is even lower than the price mortgaged to the bank, resulting in excessive losses. Therefore, those engaged in this business are constantly complaining. If this continues, not only will the native product industry of our province completely collapse, but also the entire economic livelihood of the province will be affected. The reasons for this are: firstly, Europe did not produce peanuts and peanut oil before, but now India and other places have large-scale production, which is transported to Europe at lower prices due to proximity. As a result, our goods cannot be sold. Oil mills in Hong Kong that manufacture peanut oil have closed down one after another. Therefore, the export of our country's peanuts and peanut oil to Europe and Hong Kong has been cut off, and prices have plummeted. The relief measures must first restore sales in Hong Kong and then restore the European market. Because the price difference in Europe is too great, there are about two ways to do this: first, to contact Chinese shipping companies to reduce freight rates, and to contact the Qingdao Commodity Inspection Bureau to appropriately reduce the inspection fee of two jiao per package. The pier tax, originally seven jiao per ton, will also be greatly reduced. Second, to petition the Central Government to reduce customs duties, because the customs duty on each package of peanuts is five jiao, which is more than ten yuan per ton, which is really too heavy. Not only do the native product merchants, who are on the verge of death, feel unable to bear it, but also at a time when countries around the world are vigorously implementing tariff policies, increasing import taxes and reducing export taxes in fierce competition, China, which has always been backward, will be in a very worrying situation if it does not urgently seek solutions. Currently, Qingdao export merchants are demanding that customs duties be completely exempted, which is difficult to achieve, but a reasonable reduction must be done as soon as possible, because if there is no reduction, exports will be cut off, and customs duties will be even more affected. If the reduction is slight, merchants can reluctantly sell, and customs duties can have a considerable income. Regarding this matter, it is planned to discuss it with Chairman Han. In addition, the export of chicken eggs has also decreased. When the export of draught cattle was booming, Qingdao exported 3,000 heads per day. Last summer, it was almost completely cut off. Although it is slightly better now, it is still only 400 to 500 heads per day, which is much worse than before. This is due to Japan's economic panic and weak purchasing power. Although they are now raising cattle in Kwantung, the taste of the beef is inferior and much worse than that produced in our province. Therefore, they still have to buy our country's goods to some extent. As for coal, Qingdao used to export 500,000 tons per year. Last year, due to the dumping of Fushun coal from Japan, our province only exported more than 30,000 tons per month. The fact that Chinese coal mine owners and exporters have no connection is also a major reason for failure. It is now planned to have them organize a cooperative company to develop exports. Chinese coal is of good quality, and if it is handled properly, there is still hope. It is now decided to first reorganize the Qingdao export industry. As for the coastal areas of our province, they are currently peaceful. There are two small Japanese destroyers stationed in Qingdao. There are no Japanese warships in Yantai, Longkou, and Dagu. Qinhuangdao has two large ships and two destroyers. The rest are all in Lushun. The total number of Japanese warships in North China is still eleven, with no changes. I am scheduled to return to Qingdao tonight and will not go elsewhere," etc.</p>
<p>Ge Guangting stated:</p>
<p>"I came to Jinan with Commander Shen without much of a mission. Currently, because the people across the country are poor and the finances are exhausted, the Jiaoji Railway has decided to reduce fares to alleviate the burden on the people. The third-class fare between Qingdao and Jinan is more than six yuan. In the future, it is planned to open fourth-class trains with fares reduced by half compared to third-class. The train numbers are the 15th and 16th local trains between Qingdao and Weixian, and the 13th and 14th local trains between Jinan and Fangzi. Although there are some delays due to changing trains midway, the poor value economy, not time. This can slightly lighten their burden. Currently, the railway's monthly revenue from passengers and goods is more than 40,000 yuan," etc. (16th)</p>
<p>Nanhui</p>
<p>The new Zhou section of the county road has been approved for exemption from land tax.</p>
<p>The Xinchang to Zhoupu section of the Shangnan Road, a county road in our county, previously requisitioned more than 260 mu of private land for road construction, with an assessed tax of 24 taels, 9 qian and some odd silver and 21 dan and some odd rice. The county government petitioned the provincial government to request the Ministry of Finance to grant exemption from land tax. Yesterday, the county government received an order from the provincial government approving the Ministry of Finance's reply. This land has been verified and confirmed to have been occupied for public purposes. All assessed silver and rice should be exempted from the date of requisition. The county government, upon receiving the order, immediately forwarded it to the Finance Bureau to notify the relevant property owners.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>Water Patrol Team Searches for Kidnappers</p>
<p>The Tang Xianglin family in Xiasantu, Punan, had four family members, male and female, kidnapped on the night of the 3rd of this month. Upon hearing the report, Commissioner Jin immediately ordered Fei Gongxia, the patrol officer of the water patrol team, to supervise four naval ships and rush to search the waterways of Caojing, Shanyang, and Xihutang. It was reported that the kidnappers had fled upon hearing the news. Subsequently, Pan Baozhong, the head of the anti-smuggling zone, was requested to rush to the outer sea to conduct a thorough search, but nothing was found. The patrol officers returned to Song on the 18th to report their mission. The Tang family is originally a rural family with a normal financial situation. Recently, due to the demolition and construction of small houses, rumors spread that they had unearthed hidden silver, which was spread around and attracted the attention of bandits, leading to this kidnapping disaster.</p>

<p>Summary of District Chief Meeting</p>
<p>The county government held the 39th District Chief Meeting at 10:00 AM the day before yesterday. Fifteen district chiefs, including Qian Zhongliang, attended. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu presided over the meeting. The important matters decided are as follows: 1.

<p>Appeal to Reduce License Tax</p>
<p>The county's Cigarette, Wine, Sauce, and other Trade Associations stated that the market has been depressed in recent years. In order to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants, the province has reduced the county's license tax quota by 20%. However, the newly appointed Director of the County Wine and Tobacco License Tax Bureau, Zhu Jian, not only did not grant the reduction, but also arbitrarily increased the tax amount, which violates the province's intention to show consideration for the difficulties of merchants. A joint meeting was convened and it was decided to send a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to forward a letter to the Tax Bureau to reduce the tax. The letter was sent to the County Chamber of Commerce yesterday requesting permission to forward it to the Tax Bureau to reduce the tax.</p>
<p>Drug Investigation Office Abolished</p>
<p>Chen Xisun, the director of the county's Drug Investigation Office, received an instruction yesterday from the Jiangsu Provincial Drug Investigation Office, which stated: "It is reported that Jiang Yong, the director of the Beijing-Shanghai route investigation, has established an office in Wuxi with exaggerated titles and inconsistent authority, which is inconsistent with the original intention of the appointment. It is truly wrong. In addition to ordering immediate abolition, the director is still required to diligently investigate within the territory of Wuxi County and not to indulge." Director Chen has complied with the order and is now implementing it.</p>

<p>Letter to the Editor</p>
<p>To the reporter of Shenbao: I would like to inform you that the newspapers here have reported inaccurately about the sentences in our trial, especially in the political aspect. I recently heard from a friend that your newspaper on the 15th of this month also carried the sentence "We have nothing to do with the red bandits in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces," which I supposedly said. Not only did I not say this, but as far as I remember, the judge even mentioned the name of the Red Army several times. There were no such terms as "red bandits" or "communist bandits," let alone from our mouths. Therefore, I am writing to request a correction and ask you to publish this letter in the "Letters to the Editor" column of your newspaper. With best wishes, Chen Duxiu, April 17th.</p>

<h3>Western Ratepayers in the Public Concession</h3>
<p>Yesterday's Annual and Special Meetings</p>
<p>Approved the New Budget and Amendments to the Land Regulations</p>
<p>Elected Land Committee and General Hospital Board Members</p>
<p>The Western ratepayers of the Shanghai Public Concession held their annual and special meetings yesterday afternoon from 4:00 PM at the Grand Theatre on Nanking Road. They approved the new budget, amendments to the Yangjingbang Land Regulations, and elected new members to the Land Committee and the General Hospital Board. The motion proposed by Mr. Hughes regarding the purchase of land to establish a municipal hall was discussed extensively but ultimately rejected. The details of the proceedings are recorded below:</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Attendance</p>
<p>This year's annual meeting of Western ratepayers in the Public Concession was held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Grand Theatre. Because a special meeting would follow the annual meeting to discuss amendments to the bylaws, including regulations on factory licensing, various chambers of commerce had urged ratepayers to attend in advance to meet the required quorum. As a result, the attendance of ratepayers was significantly higher than in previous years. The Public Works Department (PWD) specially hired cars to shuttle ratepayers free of charge between the Nanjing Road intersection, the Bund, and the Grand Theatre from 3:45 PM to 5:00 PM. The public bus company also ran special buses from Jing'an Temple and Tilanqiao to the Grand Theatre at 3:30 PM, charging only the regular fare for the convenience of ratepayers attending the meeting.</p>
<p>Proceedings of the Annual Meeting</p>
<p>The annual meeting commenced at 4:00 PM sharp. After the election of Mr. Peake as chairman and the appointment of a secretary, Chairman Bell, the Chairman of the Council, delivered a speech and report on all matters. The motions were then passed one by one. At 4:45 PM, the discussion began on Mr. Hughes's proposal to purchase land to establish a municipal hall. After an hour of debate, the proposal was ultimately rejected due to the opposition of Mr. Okamoto, the Japanese Council member, and Mr. Bell, the Chairman of the Council, after lengthy explanations. The meeting concluded at 5:45 PM. The agenda of the meeting was as follows: First, election of the chairman; second, election of the secretary; third, adoption of the meeting rules. The fourth motion was then discussed.</p>
<p>Chairman Bell of the Public Works Department reported on the administrative and financial situation of the past year, stating, "Mr. Chairman and gentlemen, following previous practice, I will not reiterate the routine matters of the Council here, as the annual report has already been printed and distributed for your reference. I will only address events worthy of special attention. Over the past year, the political situation, including the events in Geneva and North China, has had some impact on the situation in this concession. As this concession has an international character, both the Council and any national community in Shanghai must strive to avoid offending the national sentiments of the two major nations currently in contention. The dangerous situation in this concession is evident. A single spark can start a prairie fire, and we must be cautious. I do not wish to comment on this situation, but the annual report contains a section on the course of these political events, which may be consulted for reference."</p>
<p>Extra-Settlement Roads Issue</p>
<p>"In July 1930, the Public Works Department, with the tacit approval of several national representatives stationed in Shanghai, began discussing the issue of extra-settlement roads with the Chinese authorities, hoping to find a basis for resolution. The Chinese authorities were quite receptive. After some initial contact, both sides decided to send special representatives to discuss the details and report to their respective leaders. However, due to the political situation between China and Japan, the matter was delayed until July of last year, when an agreement was reached on key points, which seemed acceptable to the Chinese government, the Public Works Department, and the ratepayers. However, due to the complex situation in Sino-Japanese relations, the negotiations were suspended again when the Japanese authorities indicated that the proposed solution did not adequately consider Japanese interests. Further negotiations were postponed to allow the Council to address these difficulties. The Council has been consulting with the Japanese Consulate, but the nature of the matter has made progress slow. It is impossible to predict the outcome at this time, but the Council has not given up hope for a satisfactory resolution in the future."</p>
<p>Special District Court Issue</p>
<p>"The three-year agreement for the Special District Court expired at the end of March of this year. At the previous annual meeting, the former Chairman of the Council expressed hope for a more satisfactory outcome this time, but the agreement was renegotiated and extended for another three years on February 8th of this year, so this hope was not realized. However, in the exchange of notes this time, the Chinese authorities stated that they were planning to improve the delays in appeals and enforcement in civil cases. It is hoped that this plan will be realized. Although a more satisfactory outcome was not achieved this time, the national representatives have presumably done their best in considering the various circumstances."</p>
<p>Various Public Utilities</p>
<p>"The telephone, electricity, and water companies have all been in contact with the Chinese authorities regarding the issue of supply to the extra-settlement areas. The Council has also made efforts to assist in the discussions. Among them, the telephone company's contact has made some progress, and the details are available in the report. As for the water company, there has been serious opposition to the installation of water meters. This issue is quite complex and cannot be discussed in detail here. Please refer to the report."</p>
<p>Education Funding Issue</p>
<p>"The previous Chairman of the Council reported that 150,000 taels had been allocated to subsidize excellent private schools, both Chinese and foreign, within the concession. This subsidy has already been distributed, with Chinese schools receiving 55% and foreign schools receiving 45%. Last year, two Chinese primary schools were completed, and another was opened in rented premises. A dormitory for foreign schools was also completed and put into use. This year (1933), the education expenditure for Chinese children has exceeded that for foreign schools, with a ratio of 51 to 49. This is the first time in the history of the concession. The education expenditure for 1933 is 10% higher than in 1932, and almost all of the increase is for the needs of Chinese children. However, the interests of foreign children have not been neglected. The construction plan for this year includes two new foreign schools. No new Chinese primary schools are planned for this year, but the new school building for the Chinese girls' middle school on Singapore Road will soon be under construction. The current education expenditure is approximately one-tenth of the concession's tax revenue. Whether a fixed percentage of tax revenue should be designated for education expenditure in the future is worth careful consideration."</p>
<p>Report on Last Year's Accounts</p>
<p>"The regular revenue and expenditure for last year were originally expected to have a surplus of over 10,000 taels, but the result was a deficit of 53,480 taels. The Sino-Japanese Incident had a significant impact on tax revenue, with exemptions and reductions in the Northern and Eastern Districts reaching 390,000 taels. In addition, the revenue fell short by 565,840 taels. Fortunately, efforts were made to tighten expenses in all areas, and the road maintenance expenses were also reduced, so the overall result was still satisfactory. The education expenditure budget has now been listed separately so that the needs can be clearly presented. The reason for the deficit of over 56,000 taels in education expenditure last year was that part of the subsidy from the previous year was paid out last year. In addition, the revenue and expenditure of the provisional budget for last year were both lower than expected. This was partly because the repayment of the 1922 public debt had been delayed until this year, partly because a certain piece of land intended for sale had not yet been sold, and partly because approximately 100,000 taels of building expenses under the education item had been transferred to this year's budget. This is what I want to explain. I now propose that the annual report and accounts up to December 31, 1932, be approved."</p>
<p>Consideration of the Fifth Motion</p>
<p>Chairman Bell presented the 1933 budget proposal, explaining, "The 1933 budget and accompanying explanations have been printed and distributed to you. I will only briefly explain the major points of the financial policy."</p>
<p>This Year's Revenue</p>
<p>"Apart from making up for last year's deficit, the estimated revenue is approximately 16,484,620 taels, an increase of approximately 750,000 taels over last year. Most of this increase is in the general municipal rate and land tax. The land value in Shanghai has generally increased since the last valuation. For the sake of fairness in taxation, a revaluation of land is underway and is nearing completion. From July 1st of this year, the land tax will be levied based on the newly assessed values. Regarding the general municipal rate, the houses occupied by the owners have been re-evaluated, and we plan to expedite the process so that this property can bear its fair share of the rate. In addition, most of the revenue items show an increase, which is due to natural development. However, the wharfage dues will be less than the estimated amount for last year by 260,000 taels, which has already been explained. Of the revenue, 1,623,490 taels is allocated to the education expenditure budget, which is approximately one-tenth of the total amount. According to the current plan, the education expenditure will increase day by day in the future. In the near future, it may be necessary to re-examine the education policy and expenditure in its entirety."</p>
<p>Regular Expenditure</p>
<p>"Including regular education expenditure, the total is 16,247,400 taels. Efforts have been made to restrain the expansion of expenditure. However, as Shanghai continues to develop, municipal facilities must keep pace, and for safety and efficiency, equipment must be increased. All administrative departments are well aware of the need for austerity, and new plans that require significant and annual expenditure must be approached with extreme caution. I believe you will all agree."</p>
<p>Regular Budget Deficit</p>
<p>"1,386,270 taels, which is approximately equal to three seasons' worth of the 2% municipal rate. Under normal circumstances, the rate would have to be increased to achieve balance. However, in view of the current economic downturn and the fact that the port has not fully recovered from last year's turmoil, it is considered appropriate to seek balance by other means. Fortunately, the Council has a considerable amount of reserve funds available, so 1,500,000 taels will be allocated to offset the deficit. However, it must be specifically pointed out that these reserve funds have been accumulated from the sale of electricity in recent years and are not inexhaustible. Using this strategy to balance the budget this year will only delay the inevitable increase in the municipal rate."</p>
<p>On Provisional Budget</p>
<p>"The amount to be spent this year is 30,448,570 taels, including 526,150 taels for provisional education expenses, 21,566,250 taels for debt repayment, approximately 2,700,000 taels to complete projects already under construction, and approximately 4,000,000 taels for other construction projects. This is an indispensable facility for the public good."</p>
<p>Provisional Revenue</p>
<p>"The final installment of the sale price of the radio station will be paid this year, and it is proposed that 4,000,000 taels be allocated from this to the debt reduction fund. In addition, it is hoped that the public land that was not sold last year will be sold this year, so it is included in this item of revenue. In addition, the ratepayers are requested to approve the borrowing of another 6,520,000 taels. I now propose that the expenditures listed in the 1933 budget and the accompanying recommendations be approved and adopted by this meeting, and that the Council be ordered to levy the rates according to the items listed, and that the Board be authorized to borrow up to 6,520,000 taels to fund the designated uses in the provisional budget."</p>
<p>Consideration of the Sixth Motion</p>
<p>Propose amending Article 18 of the Land Regulations to improve election procedures. Chairman Bell explained: "Article 18 of the Land Regulations stipulates the procedures for electing directors, which were drafted many years ago and are now largely unsuitable. The proposed amendments will: First, allow for the establishment of several polling stations in the future to facilitate voters; second, remove the requirement for voters to sign their names on the ballots, in order to fully align with the modern ideal of secret ballots; third, the current provision specifies voting hours from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, which we propose to change to 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM to facilitate more voters; fourth, the number of ballot inspectors is no longer limited, so that more personnel can be assigned, and the voting results can be announced on the evening of the closing date. However, this proposed amendment may raise a question among the ratepayers: Why are other, more important articles not proposed for amendment besides Article 18? The answer to this question is that amendments to the Land Regulations must be approved by the Chinese authorities in order to take effect. The amendment to Article 18 does not affect Chinese sovereignty at all, so the Chinese authorities are unlikely to object. If other articles are amended, objections are unavoidable. I now propose that this meeting move to amend Article 18 of the Land Regulations and instruct the Board to contact the relevant countries. The points of amendment are: First, change "polling place" to "each polling place"; second, delete the words "sign their names"; third, change "10:00 AM to 3:00 PM" to "8:00 AM to 6:00 PM"; fourth, delete the number "two" from "two ballot inspectors".</p>
<p>Discuss Article Nine</p>
<p>Ratepayer Hughes's proposal to purchase land to establish a municipal hall, which the Public Works Department does not fully endorse. Chairman Bell spoke, saying, "Gentlemen, the motion now before us does not mention the Dahua property, but only seeks to have the Council purchase a new piece of land for the purpose of building a city hall and city center. But behind this case, it is clear that the proposal that the majority of the 1931 annual meeting rejected is being retabled, because if this case passes, then it seems that the Board cannot but reconsider that piece of land. Before explaining the reasons for the Board's opposition to purchasing the land, I would like to briefly mention the financial relationship of this matter. As far as we know, when the Dahua property was purchased from the original owner in May 1930, the price was 2,725,000 taels. Later, a small portion of it was sold, and some movable fixtures were also sold. Thus, the land actually remaining was 58 mu, 5 fen, 9 li, and 3 hao, costing 2,440,000 taels. At the end of February 1931, according to the estimation of qualified appraisers, the value of the property did not exceed 2,700,000 taels, but the price proposed to be sold to the Board that month was 4,101,510 taels, and a request was made to exchange it for the land of the Board's office, valued at 3,840,000 taels. This estimated data was 1,501,706 taels less than its value. If so, then the other party could make a profit of 2,903,216 taels in one transaction. Subsequently, on March 3 of that year, the other party withdrew the first proposal, and the Yeguang Company came forward to negotiate the sale of the Dahua property to the Board for 3,500,000 taels, no longer discussing the purchase of the Board's foundation. But even so, the other party still had a profit of 800,000 taels. The selling price now proposed to the Board is 3,910,000 taels, which, according to qualified people, is still 500,000 taels higher than its value. Therefore, this fact does not need to be commented on further. Ridiculous rumors outside may point to this move as the responsibility of whoever should "carry the baby". The main reason for advocating the purchase of the Dahua property is that the Dahua address is suitable for setting up a city center, and the Board's current office is old and not applicable, and must be rebuilt immediately. I don't know that the city center area, according to the prevailing view in Europe and the United States, is completely insufficient for the Dahua property. Try to go to the city center plan operated by the Shanghai Municipal Government in Jiangwan, and you will understand. As for the claim that the current office is old and unsuitable, it is also an exaggeration, because there is still a lot of space in it that can be added to, and after the new central patrol room and fire brigade are completed, there is enough space on its old site to build a city hall that can accommodate 2,000 people (if sentiment wants to build it) and provide other uses. And the current office is conveniently located and geographically in the center. Of course, the people in charge of the bureau can still work the same way if they move, but if the bureau is moved two miles to the west, it will be very inconvenient for those who go to the bureau for meetings or other matters. Or, if the land price in the central district is very high, and the location of the bureau is not suitable for economy, then there are many homeowners in the central district and the Bund. Why not plan to move? The land of the current office was purchased piecemeal in those days, averaging no more than 28,000 taels per mu, and at most no more than 50,000 taels per mu. If a magnificent city hall is to be built, whether it should be built now or in the future is a question. But generally speaking, in most large cities, city halls have become outdated. Major cities in Europe and the United States mostly do not use public funds to build public meeting places, but listen to private individuals to do so. People there are not ashamed of it. How can Shanghai only consider this at this time of economic difficulty?</p>
<p>Moreover, most of the residents of European and American cities, who spend money to build magnificent city halls, can use them, but Shanghai is actually a city of Easterners, and foreigners only account for a very small number. Most of the residents need hospitals, schools, and empty spaces the most, and their level of urgency is far from what the current municipal revenue can provide. The matters recommended by the medical investigation committee require 2,500,000 taels. If it is actually implemented, the benefits to the residents will be far greater than spending huge sums of money to seek the development of the Dahua property. In the arguments for purchasing the Dahua property, there is another point, that is, to have a magnificent city hall and other buildings, so that tourists can have a good impression, so as to avoid their attention to the unsightly shortcomings of the city. There is no need to argue about this kind of view. I deeply hope that the gentlemen who attend today, regardless of their personal opinions, whether they want to have a new city hall in the future, resolutely oppose all plans to make the Board be dragged into purchasing the Dahua property, so as to waste public funds."</p>
<p>Special Meeting Proceedings</p>
<p>After the annual meeting, a special meeting continued. Mr. Peake was still the chairman. Chairman Bell reported that the Board has been concerned about the situation of the industrial community in the concession for many years. Many Chinese or foreign factory owners pay close attention to the happiness of the workers, and their factory equipment is still satisfactory. However, most of the factories are not prepared for preventing dangers, so men, women, and children work in these places at the risk of their lives. This is not allowed by modern municipalities. However, some of the Board's powers in the Land Regulations have not been clearly defined. Although under Bylaws 34 and 35, the Board can order licenses for the listed businesses and places, the existence of this power for those engaged in industry is undoubtedly true, but it has not been clearly stated. The reason why industry is not seen in the original list is that this has a historical reason. The last time the Land Regulations and their bylaws were amended was in 1898. At that time, large-scale modern industry was just emerging in Shanghai. The first yarn factory was established in the concession in 1890. The general large-scale development has been in the past 30 years. At that time, factories were not listed in the licensing list. It is true that general handicraft industry has no special dangers. At that time, the Board did not consider it necessary to license them, and the Chinese officials of that day did not have this intention either. The rise of large-scale industry, with many workers, has caused dangers, just as elsewhere. Try to compare the power transmission components in modern yarn factories with the differences in manual spinning and weaving, and the management methods must be different. Also, in factories with a large number of workers, the use of materials that may burn and explode has already been clearly visible to us. However, the attitude of laissez-faire towards modern industry cannot be maintained for a long time. However, although the Board has long understood these situations, it is not easy to govern before its legal authority has been clearly defined. And before this, the Chinese government had not effectively restrained factories, so the progress of this concession had to be delayed. In 1923, the Beijing government had promulgated a provisional charter, but it has not been implemented. In 1925, the Board cited this intention and planned to ask the ratepayers to authorize the management of the charter labor issue, but due to political and other relations, it seemed difficult to do anything in a part of the Shanghai industrial area. If child labor is not allowed in factories in the concession, the result will only be to drive people to factories in the Chinese concession. This problem cannot be solved. To extrapolate, factory owners can argue everywhere, saying that they are sharing the concession without considering the outside world. It is only creating unfair competition. Fortunately, in recent years, the situation has greatly improved. In 1926, the unified agency of the Shanghai Municipality was established. In the following year, a department on industry was established in the Municipal Government's Bureau of Social Affairs. In 1929, the Chinese government promulgated the Factory Law. In 1930, it successively announced the regulations for its implementation. In 1931, the Factory Law was promulgated and implemented, and the Factory Inspection Law was promulgated at the same time. Therefore, the Board believes that the Chinese concession has made considerable progress, and it is not unfair competition to take action in the concession. The Factory Law was declared to be implemented on August 1. The Board then published a formal declaration in the Gazette on August 7, expressing its support for the principle of industrial management. For the sake of practical progress, it continued to publish a plan in the Gazette on December 9, planning to convene a special meeting of ratepayers in April 1932 to amend Bylaw 34, so that the Board could have the necessary powers to license factories. Unexpectedly, the port was under martial law at the beginning of last year, and this move was postponed until this year. Now the Board will immediately amend the clause with the foreign taxpayers in the concession, so that the factory can be licensed. According to the common practice of licensing, the situation of the place must be satisfactory to the prescribed conditions before the license can be issued. After the license is issued, it must also be handled in accordance with the conditions, otherwise a fine will be imposed or the license will be revoked. The power of the Board officials to carry out inspections arises with the license. As for the conditions proposed by the Board, within the possible scope, it will be consistent with the Factory Law of the Chinese government that has been implemented or will be implemented in the Chinese concession. The Board also believes that it is appropriate to establish an understanding with the Chinese authorities, so that both parties can implement the same charter, so as to avoid bias. At the same time, the Board determined that the possible facilities for health and safety are the most urgent. Public health and public safety are related to the Board in other aspects, and they are also fundamentally important in factories. The Factory Law and the regulations for implementation have stated certain principles of health and safety, but the factory owners lack guidance on how to comply with them. The Board's license charter will clearly stipulate these key points. In order to implement a reasonable and common factory security plan, the Board is willing to cooperate with the Chinese authorities as far as consultation can be achieved, but the Board is unwilling to let the dangerous situation exist for a long time. If an agreement is not reached on the security and health conditions in the Factory Law, then the Board will stipulate scientific and reasonable conditions in the license charter. The Bureau of Social Affairs of the Municipal Government advocates that the power to inspect factories in the concession belongs to the bureau. The Board believes that this claim has no basis. Recent court precedents have made the Board's complete police power under the Land Regulations even more undoubtedly. The Board has been administering according to this charter for many years. The "police power" is indeed not easy to determine its definition, but it is now generally recognized that it includes all major needs of the public. Its scope is quite broad, and it is particularly related to peace, security, health, morality, and the general happiness of the public. The police power of a city must adapt to the changes in the situation and the daily needs of the public for the sake of the public's happiness. What is not considered to be within this power at a certain time may be considered legal to exercise the power at another time due to changes in the situation. According to the modern legal view, the Board's inherent police power actually includes considerable jurisdiction over factories, and the most effective way to do it is to have factories obtain licenses. The Board is prepared to cooperate with the Municipal Government to the extent that it can be done, in order to have a uniform charter in all factories in Shanghai, but the Board is determined to fully retain the integrity of its administrative power in the concession no matter what. If the taxpayers approve, then all factories owned by Chinese and foreigners will be required to obtain licenses. I don't need to tell the taxpayers about the need for reform, because the explosion a few weeks ago was shocking. From now on, preventing danger cannot completely eliminate danger, but it can reduce its degree. The safety in the factory is the responsibility of the factory owner, but the administrative authorities can assist it, instruct it on safety facilities, and guarantee its implementation through appropriate inspections. Now it is proposed to amend Bylaw 34 by adding the words "Anyone who owns, occupies, or operates a factory, workshop, or engages in industry" in the first line. Before formally discussing the amendment to the bylaws of the Land Regulations, someone suddenly stood up and asked why the consent of the consular corps and the diplomatic corps was not sought first. After the Chairman of the Council explained that the special meeting must be passed first, and then the consent of the consular corps and the diplomatic corps must be obtained, he made another speech, and then passed the amendment to Bylaw 34 of the Yangjingbang Land Regulations by raising hands. The meeting adjourned at 6:05.</p>
<p>Resolutions</p>
<p>(A) The decisions made by the annual meeting: 1. The fourth motion on the 1932 annual report and accounts was passed as originally proposed. 2. The fifth motion on the 1933 new budget and requesting the Board to be allowed to borrow up to 6,520,000 taels at its discretion was passed as originally proposed. 3. The sixth motion to amend Article 18 of the Land Regulations was passed as originally proposed. 4. The seventh motion selected S.H. Peake as the land committee member for this year. 5. The eighth motion selected P.W. Massey, F.T. Raven, T.B. Dunn, and A.C. Bryson as the new directors of the General Hospital for this year. 7. The ninth motion, Hughes's proposal to purchase land to establish a municipal hall, was rejected. (B) The decision made by the special meeting: 1. The motion to amend Bylaw 34 of the Land Regulations was passed as originally proposed.</p>
<p>New Directors Take Office</p>
<p>All the newly elected directors of the Public Works Department will have a luncheon this afternoon and take office at the same time, and elect two new directors, chairman and vice chairman, but no ceremony will be held. It is also heard that the new Chinese director, Bei Songsun, has resigned from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association because he is going to the United States with Finance Minister Song Ziwen, but the Taxpayers' Association will grant him leave because the procedure for supplementing the election is not easy.</p>
<h3>Contract for Trans-Boundary Road Telephone Line Signed Formally Yesterday</h3>
<p>Signed yesterday afternoon at the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities by three parties.</p>
<p>Valid for one year, further discussion for permanent solutions.</p>
<p>The issue of the temporary contract for telephone lines on trans-boundary roads has been rumored for a long time and has attracted much attention. It is now known that this contract was formally signed yesterday morning at 11:00 AM at the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities by Xu Peihuang, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, Xu Xueyu, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, and Gail, Vice President of the Shanghai Telephone Company. The long-delayed issue of telephone lines on trans-boundary roads has now come to a temporary end. The details of the process and the original text of the contract are recorded below.</p>
<p>Circumstances at the time of signing the temporary contract for trans-boundary road telephone lines (Photo by Li Zunyong)</p>
<p>Negotiation Process</p>
<p>On December 17th of the 14th year of the Republic of China, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation signed a communication contract with the former Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company, which operated telephone services within the concession. In addition to stipulating the communication methods for users of both parties, the contract also stipulated the handling of telephone installations by the company in the areas of Shanghai South, Zhabei, and Pudong. As for the installation of telephones by the company in trans-boundary road sections, it was stipulated in the annex to the contract. The term of this contract was five years, expiring on December 16th of the 19th year. In August of the 19th year, the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Telephone Company was sold to the American-owned Shanghai Telephone Company. At that time, the municipal authorities and the Ministry of Transportation, after some consideration, believed that telephone communication was of great importance, and that Chinese-concession communication could not be stopped in practice. As for foreign companies installing telephones in trans-boundary road sections, since this was based on a contract, the basis would be lost upon the expiration of the contract, and no further installations should be allowed. However, in fact, residents in these sections had a great need for telephones. Before the lines of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation could reach them, it was necessary to take both into consideration and negotiate appropriate solutions under suitable conditions. In addition, foreign-owned telephones installed in the Chinese area should have been recovered according to the above-mentioned communication contract, either because they had already expired or because the contract stipulated that one party could propose and negotiate their recovery. Now that the contract has expired, it is difficult to allow further installations. As for those already installed, in order to take into account the factual situation, they could be temporarily maintained and recovered by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau at any time in the future. In this way, Chinese-concession communication would not be interrupted, and sovereignty would be maintained. Therefore, on December 17th of the 19th year, the day after the communication contract expired, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, in consultation with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, convened a meeting with the Shanghai Telephone Company, proposing to sign a temporary contract stipulating temporary measures for the above-mentioned matters. They would negotiate long-term solutions during the term of this contract. Both parties expressed their approval. After the Bureau of Public Utilities and the Shanghai Telephone Bureau agreed on the principles, they submitted them to the municipal government and the Ministry of Transportation for approval. The Bureau of Public Utilities then drafted the contract and, after several contacts with the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, formally began negotiations with the Shanghai Telephone Company on May 22nd of the 10th year. After more than a dozen formal and informal meetings, the contract draft was finally signed by the three parties on October 23rd of that year. After the draft was signed, it was said that the formal contract could be signed soon. However, unexpectedly, it was delayed for several months. After repeated inquiries to the company, it was learned that the contract had not yet been approved by the concession authorities, so it could not be formally signed. After further contact between the three parties, the result was that the issue of modification was being discussed. Unfortunately, the January 28th Incident occurred in this city, and the matter was suspended for several months. It was not until October of the 21st year that discussions were resumed. Subsequently, after more than a dozen formal and informal meetings, an agreement was finally reached. The draft was revised and finalized. On the one hand, the Bureau of Public Utilities submitted the draft to the municipal government for record; on the other hand, the Shanghai Telephone Bureau reported it to the Ministry of Transportation. The Shanghai Telephone Company also repeatedly asked the two concession authorities for instructions. Now that all issues have been completely resolved, the formal signing took place at the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities at 11:00 AM yesterday.</p>
<p>Signing Circumstances</p>
<p>At 11:00 AM yesterday, the two parties first held a meeting in the conference room of the Bureau of Public Utilities to discuss the content of the contract. Participants included Xu Peihuang, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, Zheng Baocheng, Head of the Third Section of the Bureau of Public Utilities, Xu Xueyu, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation, Yu Bingjian, Chief Engineer, Liang Miaozhang, Secretary of the Public Works Department Advisory Office, Gail, Vice President of the Shanghai Telephone Company, Frittilan, and Franklin Winter. After discussing each clause and verifying the Chinese and English versions of the original and duplicate copies, they signed the contract. The signatories were Xu Peihuang, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, and Xu Xueyu, Director of the Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation. On the other side was Gail, Vice President of the Shanghai Telephone Company (the highest person in charge in Shanghai is the Vice President). The temporary contract is entirely in Chinese, totaling eight copies. The English version is a duplicate copy, only with the names of the signatories written on it, without signing.</p>

<h3>Murder Case on the Xin Renhe Steamer</h3>
<p>Five peddlers were thrown into the sea and died tragically.</p>
<p>The steamer was carrying drugs and was seized by the police.</p>
<p>Suspected peddlers leaked the secret, resulting in five deaths.</p>
<p>Compensation for the families of the deceased, the case was discovered.</p>
<p>Gu Shaoqing, General Manager, and Wang Guanxian, Associate Manager, of Yuxing Steamer Company at No. 104 Yangjia Ferry Street, Nanjing, owned a steamer called Xin Renhe, which usually transported passengers and goods to and from the Beisha and Haimen areas, with a very developed business. However, in March of this year, the steamer carried a large batch of drugs from Haimen to Shanghai, intending to sell them. Unexpectedly, the matter was not kept secret and was learned by the Shanghai police. They sent police officers to inspect and seized all the drugs hidden on board and brought them back for questioning.</p>
<p>Bearing a Grudge Against the Peddlers for Leaking Information</p>
<p>After the incident, the crew of the steamer suspected that the five peddlers who sold food on the steamer, Ma Koubao, Mei Laoer, Zhou Datong, Wei Jincheng, and Sun Xiliang, had leaked the information. Harboring a grudge, they developed a murderous intent. On the 12th of this month, while the steamer was sailing from Haimen to Shanghai, the sailors, including Huang Fusheng, arrested Ma and the other four, beat them with fists and feet, and then reported the matter to the shipowner, Sun Xingsheng.</p>
<p>Beaten and Hung from the Top of the Ship</p>
<p>At that time, Associate Manager Wang Guanxian was also on board. After being reported, he, along with shipowner Sun Jisheng, compradore Guo Xihou, vice compradore Chen Baosheng, second mate Wang Moqing, chief boatswain Chen Yinglong, and second boatswain Feng Fusheng, discussed the matter. They tied up Ma and the others with ropes, hung them from the top of the ship, and beat them severely with iron bars until Ma and the others were covered in injuries, bleeding profusely, and barely breathing. Then they were lowered one by one and locked in cabin number 11.</p>
<p>Placed in Sacks and Thrown into the Sea</p>
<p>Before long, one of them, for some reason, suddenly loosened the rope. The man suddenly rolled into the river. Wang and the others, seeing this, ordered the sailors to lower a sampan and rescue him. After he was rescued, he was tied up again with ropes. Then a huge stone was tied to each person, and they were placed in sacks. When the ship passed near Santaijia, not far from Haimen, they were thrown into the river one by one, causing them to drown. After the incident, Wang and the others feared that if the matter was leaked and heard by the police, they would not be able to escape the law.</p>
<p>All Crew Members Signed a Secret Pact</p>
<p>Vice Compradore Chen Baosheng then proposed that all crew members sign a secret pact. From then on, they would keep the matter secret, and anyone who dared to leak the news would be dealt with in the same way as Ma and the others. Wang and the others unanimously agreed. They sounded the steam whistle and gathered more than one hundred sailors, tea servers, workers, and cooks on board to sign the secret pact, with each person signing and sealing the pact to show their solemnity.</p>
<p>Compensation of Two Hundred Silver Dollars to the Deceased's Family</p>
<p>They dispatched Shi Wanjin, who was in charge of insurance and other matters on the ship, to Shanghai to contact the families of the victims. The company was willing to send two hundred silver dollars to each deceased's family as compensation to settle the matter. Shi, upon hearing the order, went to Xieqiao on the 17th of this month and first went to the home of Zhou Datong, to contact Zhou's wife, Zhou Ma. Shi informed her of Zhou's death. Zhou Ma was shocked upon hearing this terrible news.</p>
<p>The Victims' Families Reported to the River Police</p>
<p>After Shi repeatedly persuaded her to settle the matter peacefully, Zhou Ma feigned compliance. However, Zhou Ma believed that her husband had been murdered in such a tragic manner and could not be settled with money. She then invited Ma Koubao's wife, Ma Chen; Mei Laoer's wife, Mei You; Wei Jincheng's wife, Wei Zhu; and Sun Xiliang's wife, Sun Zhou, to report to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau's River Patrol Team, requesting redress. Zhu Haishan, the captain of the team, upon hearing the report, realized the importance of the matter and immediately dispatched a senior police officer to Shi's home at No. 13 Dong'an Lane, Fangbang Road, to arrest Shi Wanjin and bring him back to the team. Shi then confessed all the details of the murders of Ma and the others he had witnessed on the ship. The captain, realizing that the ship had sailed to Haimen a few days ago and was scheduled to return to Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 18th), dispatched Deputy Captain Ren Runsheng, along with detectives Yang Chunting, Yan Fuhai, Chen Xiqing, Jiang Linquan, Tang Xizhang, Zhong Yisheng, Gao Yongquan, Jiang Boying, Wu Jianren, Yao Kejun, and Police Chief Yang Bingkui, to secretly wait at Pier No. 5, Shiliupu, Nanshi at around 11:00 PM the night before yesterday.</p>
<p>More Than Thirty People Arrested</p>
<p>Before long, the ship was seen sailing in from outside. Deputy Captain Ren and the others, without waiting for the ship to dock, immediately used two small steamships to approach the Xin Renhe, jumped onto the ship, and arrested all the crew members. Shipowner Sun Jisheng, Compradore Guo Xihou, Second Mate Wang Moqing, Second Boatswain Feng Fusheng, and Zhang Baolin, Liu Tingsheng, Wu Ruisheng, Gu You, Liu Maoda, Huang Fusheng, Shi Guofang, Gao Jichen, Wang Xingjiang, Ye Yuanfu, Chen Hesheng, Shen Shizhong, Lu Yongguang, Feng Xingfa, Shen Xinlang, Shen Xingqiao, Wang Mingda, Liu Yongqing, Zhang Jincai, Shi Duolang, Gao Jiyu, Gao Jixing, Zhang Xingjin, Zhang Yaozu, Shen Ruifeng, Yuan Ada, Huang Chuan, Xu Tingyuan, Gu Jinting, Xu Da Wuzi, Fei Shunhua, Zhang Xiaozhang, Zhou Wangming, and other sailors, tea servers, and workers, totaling more than thirty people, were arrested.</p>
<p>Confessed to the Murder, Associate Manager Was the Mastermind</p>
<p>However, Associate Manager Wang Guanxian, Vice Compradore Chen Baosheng, and Chief Boatswain Chen Yinglong were not on the ship and were not arrested. All the arrested suspects were brought back to the team. Captain Zhu, along with Deputy Captain Li Chenghua, interrogated the suspects one by one. The suspects confessed to the joint murder of Ma Koubao and the other four, but pushed the mastermind of the murder onto Associate Manager Wang Guanxian alone. The suspects confessed that the idea of signing the secret pact originated with the Second Compradore Chen Baosheng. Captains Zhu and Li, realizing that this was a shocking murder case, ordered the officers to record the suspects' confessions in detail, and then had the suspects sign their confessions, preparing a report to be submitted to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Government Decides to Host Philippine Inspection Group</h3>
<p>The Group is Scheduled to Arrive from Japan on the 24th</p>

<h3>Preventing the Dumping of Japanese Goods</h3>
<p>The Ministries of Finance and Industry Establish a Special Committee</p>
<p>Since Japanese goods implemented a dumping policy, Chinese industry and commerce have been greatly affected. The Ministries of Industry and Finance have specially established a dumping committee. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Dumping Policy</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, Japanese goods have faced sluggish sales due to the impact of boycotts, resulting in overproduction and significant losses. Taking advantage of the post-war exhaustion of China's social economy, they adopted a dumping policy. The dumping methods include: 1. Subdividing goods; 2. Reducing prices; 3. Changing brands; 4. Including transportation. The main dumping goods are cotton textiles, coal, cement, and fishery products, followed by matches, paper, etc.</p>
<p>After Implementation</p>
<p>The reasons for Japanese goods being dumped in China are that China's tariffs are lower than other countries, and transportation is convenient. China was originally the largest market for Japanese goods. Fearing that other countries' foreign goods would enter after the boycott, and that Japanese goods could not compete with European and American goods and could not be exported to Europe and America, the Japanese government subsidized and used Chinese traitors to promote sales. Since its implementation, Chinese industry and commerce have been affected.</p>
<p>Measures to Prevent</p>
<p>Japanese goods are dumped along the Yangtze River, with Shanghai and Hankou as the centers. The reduction of work in Chinese yarn factories, the sluggish business of cement, paper, and fishery industries are all due to dumping. In order to prevent this, the Ministries of Industry and Finance have specially established a dumping committee to investigate the situation of Japanese goods dumping and take measures to stop it, in order to protect China's industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Lianxing Vessel and Austriaca Collide in Huangpu River Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Both Sustained Damage, Will Be Adjudicated According to Law</p>
<p>The Lianxing vessel of the Zhaoxing Steamship Company at 13 Guangdong Road collided with the Norwegian vessel Austriaca in the Huangpu River near the Shanghai Waterworks yesterday morning when departing for Longkou, each sustaining damage. The matter will be adjudicated according to law. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Two Vessels Collide</p>
<p>The Lianxing vessel, with a deadweight of 2,200 tons, departed from the Longmao Wharf in Lujiazui, Pudong at 7:30 yesterday morning, loaded with approximately 1,600 tons of cargo, heading for Yantai and Longkou. At 8:00 a.m., when it reached the river surface near the Shanghai Waterworks, the Norwegian cargo vessel Austriaca, with a deadweight of approximately 5,000 tons, was turning around to dock. The two vessels suddenly collided.</p>
<p>Each Sustained Damage</p>
<p>After the collision between the Lianxing vessel and the Austriaca, the iron sheet rivets on the bow of the Lianxing vessel were damaged, and the side of the front hold of the Austriaca was also damaged, but neither was seriously damaged. After inspection by both shipowners, the Lianxing vessel stopped exporting and sailed back to dock at the Longmao Wharf in Pudong for repairs. The Austriaca docked at the Dongyang Wharf, preparing for repairs.</p>
<p>Will Be Adjudicated</p>
<p>After receiving the report from the shipowner, Zhaoxing Company believed that the Austriaca vessel was too large and clumsy in turning around, resulting in a failure to avoid and causing the accident, and therefore the vessel should be held responsible. After receiving the report from the shipowner, the Norwegian side believed that the Lianxing vessel did not avoid seeing the Austriaca vessel turning around, resulting in the collision, and therefore the vessel should be held responsible. Now the two vessels each hold their own reasons. As for the issue of responsibility, the two companies will invite notaries to adjudicate according to law.</p>

The book was originally planned to have 800 pages and about 1.2 million words, and was scheduled to be published in March of this year.

<p>The "Changjiang Hao" Railway Ferry</p>
<p>All Sectors Can Visit</p>
<p>The news that the "Changjiang Hao" ferry, ordered by the Ministry of Railways from the British Swan Hunter &amp; Wigham Richardson shipyard, has arrived in Shanghai was reported yesterday. The ferry is currently berthed near the Meifu Oil Depot.

If people from all walks of life want to visit the new-style ferry, it is said that they can contact the China General Manager of the factory, the MacMillan &amp; Jardine Company, on Sichuan Road.</p>
<h3>Sino-German Jointly Run Steel Plant</h3>
<p>Chinese and German Personnel Departed from Shanghai Together Yesterday</p>
<p>To Survey the Plant Site at Leijiagou, Ma'anshan</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry and Germany jointly run steel, sulfuric acid, and other plants. Due to the central financial relationship, the capital has been reduced to 5 million. At present, a steel plant is being actively planned and carried out. Due to various reasons, the address has not been determined. Since the plant is set up to smelt steel, it must be close to the coal-producing area for convenience. It was previously planned to be in Leijiagou, but the result was that 19 kilns were buried there. If they were to be reorganized, it would inevitably require funding, so it became decided but unresolved. Later, there was a saying that Ma'anshan, Anhui Province, along the Yangtze River, was chosen, but in the end, it was shelved because the plan was not properly arranged. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency went to the International Trade Bureau in Shanghai yesterday to inquire and learned that Mr. Kang Daofu, the Shanghai representative of the German Hope Company, said that the Ministry of Industry had previously set a scope, so yesterday morning, he accompanied Huang Jintao, Director of the Mining Department of the Ministry of Industry, and Chinese and Western mining engineers, and took a boat to Leijiagou and Ma'anshan to measure first. If they think that any place is most suitable, they will return to Beijing and discuss it with Chen Gongbo, Minister of Industry, to decide, so that a steel plant can first choose one as the plant site and start construction.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Aviation Students in America Devote Themselves to the Motherland</h3>
<p>The Dalu Bao reports that a group of overseas Chinese from Oregon, USA, totaling thirteen people, including two young women, indignant at the Japanese airplanes ravaging the motherland, are returning to the country to serve, expressing their patriotic fervor. They arrived in Shanghai aboard the SS President Taft a few days ago. All of them have received aviation training and now plan to join the Chinese Air Force and go to the front lines in North China to resist the violent Japanese. Each of them has a skull-style badge pinned to their chest, indicating their determination to sacrifice themselves for the country. According to reports, the Anti-Japanese Association of Chinese in Portland, Oregon, raised funds to establish the China Aviation Club, opened aviation classes, and hired American instructors to train aviation guards. The people who have arrived in Shanghai are all students of that class. Most of them have been examined by American authorities and issued certificates. Before departing from the United States, the club had prearranged contact with the National Government. According to Mr. Yang, a member of the group, those who came together this time are all graduates of the second class. The first class, also of thirteen people, returned to the country last June to join the Guangzhou Air Force. The China Aviation Club of Oregon was established after the September 18th Incident. The Anti-Japanese Association of Overseas Chinese used more than 20,000 US dollars to purchase two training aircraft and hired five American aviators as instructors. It is reported that there are currently six places where overseas Chinese groups in the United States are teaching aviation, and there are many individuals studying piloting separately. Although they practice separately, their goals are the same, namely, to resolve to resist Japan and not participate in internal wars. Mr. Yang also stated that many American aviators and pilots are willing to come to China to help resist Japan. They only need to be provided with travel expenses, and they will definitely accept with pleasure.</p>

<h3>"A Glimpse of the Northeast," A Detailed Account of the Recent Situation in the Northeast, is Republished and Sold</h3>
<p>More than a year after the loss of the three northeastern provinces, and with the recent loss of Rehe, the people of the country all want to know about the situation in the Northeast after its fall. The author of this book, Mr. Ge Wenlie, is young and handsome. He originally worked in Shanghai. After the September 18th Incident, indignant at the rampant violence of the Japanese, he resolutely abandoned his job and went north to participate in the anti-Japanese work. Last winter, he was ordered to go beyond the border to investigate the situation of the volunteer army and the situation of the Japanese invaders outside the border, to use as military material. Mr. Ge happily accepted the order and ventured out of the border alone. He passed through Andong, Shenyang, Changchun, Harbin, and reached Hailar, then turned back and went to Xinmin, Faku, Tongliao, and other counties, and then inspected various places in Rehe. It took several months, going through all kinds of hardships, repeatedly subjected to interrogation and imprisonment by Japanese slaves, but he was finally able to turn danger into safety and return safely to Peiping, completing his great mission. Mr. Ge also fell ill for several months due to overwork. This book was written by the author while ill, detailing the situation in various places in the Northeast after its fall. It is a book that the people inside the border must read. The first edition of ten thousand copies has been sold out in Peiping and Tianjin. The second edition of five thousand has also sold more than half. Each copy only charges 3 jiao of ocean currency for printing costs, and 1 fen for postage. If you want to register, add 8 fen of ocean currency for registration fees. Stamps can be used instead of cash. The general distribution office is handled by Mr. Liu Hanru, 608 Route Paul Henry, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Mother of Wenying Complains for Her Daughter</h3>
<p>Accusing Cheng Meixian of Rape of Her Daughter</p>
<p>And Instigating Fan Hongsheng to Murder</p>
<p>The female physiognomist Wenying was murdered by Fan Hongsheng last summer. The detective arrested Fan and sent him to the First Special District Court, which sentenced him to fifteen years in prison. After that, the mother of the deceased, Huang Wu, believed that Fan's murder of her daughter was instigated by her daughter's teacher, who was also her daughter's lover, the itinerant physiognomist Diao Ao Ke, whose real name was Cheng Meixian. She had filed a criminal self-accusation against Cheng for the crime of inciting murder, but it was dismissed due to insufficient evidence. However, the woman's heart to avenge her daughter became even more urgent. She specially made a yellow oilcloth vest that reached her knees and a yellow oilcloth rectangular flag, detailing the facts of her daughter's murder. She put one on her body and held the other in her hand, and did not spare herself the trouble of traveling to the capital to appeal to the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Supreme Court, crying and begging for redress. She repeatedly received instructions from the Minister of the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Luo Wengan, "The Ministry has consulted the Ministry of Judicial Administration for handling based on the situation," and "The Ministry has approved the Ministry of Judicial Administration's reply, stating that it has ordered the Jiangsu Higher Second Branch Court to investigate and handle it according to law." Therefore, the woman has now filed a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Cheng Meixian and his wife, Cheng Lingqing, and Feng Mengyun, the editor of the Da Jing Bao, of the crimes of disrupting the family and obstructing freedom. The general content is that her daughter, Wenying, (also known as Wu Yuexian or Yang Wenying), was induced to come to Shanghai from Hangzhou by Cheng Lingqing at the age of thirteen, falsely claiming to learn photography, but in reality, it was for Cheng Meixian to commit obscene acts of adultery for profit. Her daughter, under their lewd power, had no strength to resist, and at that time she was still a minor, so she could only let them do what they wanted. Last year, when she was eighteen years old, she had a little knowledge and could not bear to be adulterated, so she repeatedly tried to escape the tiger's mouth, but unexpectedly angered the defendant and instigated Fan Hongsheng to kill the plaintiff. Her daughter saw and protected her, causing her to be killed. At that time, due to the lease agreement of the court in the concession, the detective could not prosecute and could not convict, so Fan Hongsheng was only sentenced for murder. The defendant Cheng Meixian and others can communicate with gods with money, and they are at large outside the law. After investigation, Cheng Lingqing induced her daughter to come to Shanghai, and Cheng Meixian used Feng Mengyun, a pretty boy from the Da Jing Bao, to seduce her, using unbearable obscene behavior to cause her to become sexually aroused, and then Cheng Meixian took the opportunity to rape her, and then collected yin to replenish yang, and then forced her to secretly prostitute and grind mirrors. The current Hongying, whose name was changed to Hongyun after hearing the news of Jing's death, and the female physiognomists such as Tianzhen, were all abducted and subjected to the same obscene adultery. All the hotels have such bewitching formations, and the defendant reaps the benefits, and countless youths in Shanghai are harmed by their witchcraft. All the defendants have disrupted the plaintiff's family and harmed the morals of Shanghai, poisoning the society and leaving endless harm, which is a crime under Articles 257, 258, and 249 of the Criminal Law. In addition to requesting a summons for a strict trial according to law, there is also an ancillary civil lawsuit, calculated at 100 yuan per month for her daughter's salary, calculated at 30 years, and the defendant should be required to compensate 36,000 yuan, etc. The case was scheduled to open at 2:00 PM yesterday in the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Only Lingqing did not arrive among the defendants. The others, Cheng Meixian and Feng Mengyun, arrived in court one after another with the plaintiff Huang Wu. The woman was still wearing the special vest she needed to express her grievances. Cheng Meixian wanted to understand the words written on it, so he stood behind the woman and looked at it closely. The woman did not notice it at first. Later, when she turned back, the enemies met, and they were particularly clear-sighted. She immediately pointed at Cheng and scolded him painfully. It was not until Judge Wu Zehan opened the court that the evil voice stopped. Judge Wu immediately ordered the woman to state the facts of the self-accusation. According to the testimony, her daughter Wenying was brought to Shanghai from Hangzhou by Diao Ao Ke Lingqing at the age of thirteen, saying that she would learn photography and learn from Diao as a teacher for a period of three years. At the age of fourteen, she was raped by Diao Ao Ke. At the age of sixteen, her daughter explained it to her, but she was afraid of the power of Cheng and others, so she did not dare to say it face-to-face, only secretly. As for going to various hotels to prostitute, it was Lingqing who instructed her. As for Feng Mengyun, he was in league with Cheng and others, helping to prevent her daughter from returning to Hangzhou. Feng had also had a relationship with her daughter, and last year he still asked her for photos and asked her to meet him, etc. When questioned, the defendant Cheng Meixian confessed that he had now divorced Lingqing, that Wenying was brought to Shanghai by the plaintiff, and was initially mortgaged to Lingqing, and that he had redeemed her for 160 yuan. He only had a physical relationship with her at the age of seventeen, and then signed a contract for cooperation in business, but the contract was terminated in less than a year. Lingqing also did not take her to a hotel to prostitute, etc. Feng Mengyun completely denied the accused details, saying that he asked for photos for the purpose of publishing them in the newspaper, etc. Judge Wu then ordered a change of date and summoned Cheng Lingqing to the court for further interrogation.</p>
<h3>Wang Ying Owes More Than 90,000 Gold in Public Funds</h3>
<p>The Former Magistrate of Jiaxing County</p>
<p>Dismissed and Arrested After Coming to Shanghai</p>
<p>Wang Ying, courtesy name Yueyuan, from Anhui, was the magistrate of Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, during the Qi-Lu War. When Lu was defeated, Wang also resigned. At that time, he did not handle the handover. Later, the Zhejiang Provincial Government found out that Wang owed more than 90,000 yuan in public funds during his tenure. Because Wang's whereabouts were unknown, it was impossible to recover the funds. Recently, the detectives of the Public Security Bureau of the Zhejiang Provincial Capital found out that Wang was living at No. 20, Xinjia Garden, Xinzha Road, Public Concession, Shanghai. They reported it to the director, who requested the relevant detectives to be dispatched by the relevant detectives to arrest Wang and hand him over to the First Special District Court. The court ordered him to be detained temporarily, and the procedures for transfer were to be corrected and then reviewed. It has been recorded in the previous newspaper. Now it is known that the Zhejiang Provincial Government has ordered the Finance Department to transfer the case files to the Procuratorate of the Hang County District Court for investigation according to law. The Procuratorate then prepared a formal transfer document and specially sent Secretary Chen Jun to Shanghai to request the First Special Court for transfer. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court and ordered Wang Ying to be brought to court for questioning. First, the Public Security Bureau's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the situation of the Public Security Bureau's assistance. Since there is now a formal letter from the official government requesting transfer, the Public Security Bureau will not object and should request the court to decide. Judge Wu then briefly questioned Wang Ying a few words and then ordered him to be handed over to the personnel from the Procuratorate of the Hang County District Court to be taken away for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Three More Radio Towers Added Outside the Yangtze River Estuary</h3>
<p>A Great Benefit to the Navigation Industry</p>
<p>The Zi Lin Bao reports that the Yangtze River estuary has many shoals, reefs, and whirlpools, and is often foggy, making navigation very dangerous. The port authorities have added three radio towers to assist ships in finding their way. The first tower is located on North Saddle Island (i.e., Hua Island Mountain) and has been in use for two years. The second tower is located on Da Ji Mountain and will be completed and put into use on the first of next month. The third tower is located on Shawei Mountain (also known as Sheshan) and has not yet been completed. The North Saddle Island radio tower has been very effective in the past two years, and ocean-going ships especially rely on it. Now, after the completion of the Da Ji Mountain radio tower, ships can use two types of radio direction finding to correct errors in the navigation route calculation. If the third tower on Shawei Mountain is completed, this type of error can be reduced to a minimum. The motors used in each tower are Marconi automatic equipment, which automatically generates electricity at very precise times. For example, in clear weather, the Da Ji Mountain radio tower will generate electricity at the second and thirty-second minutes of each hour, and the North Saddle Island radio tower will generate electricity at the thirtieth minute of each hour. In foggy weather, Da Ji Mountain will generate electricity every six minutes, starting from the sixth minute of each hour, and the North Saddle Island radio tower will generate electricity every six minutes, starting from the second minute of each hour. Each tower has a power of 500 watts and a wavelength of 1,000 meters. The switches are all automatic, and if there is an obstacle, it can send a warning signal to allow the tower manager to turn off the button, and Shanghai can immediately send experts to repair it when it hears that there is no electricity signal being sent.</p>
<h3>Representatives of the Nanyang Company's Dismissed Workers' Union Petitioned Yesterday</h3>
<p>Stating the Process of Pushing Representatives to Review the Incentive Wage Book</p>
<p>The Nanyang Office of the Fourth District Cigarette Industry Union, because the company's announcement on the 17th dismissed 15 members, Chen Long, Li Gui, Zhou Lian, Zhang Desheng, Li Ajin, Li Xinfa, Zhao Jinchuan, Wang Jiansheng, Zhang Zhang, Wu Shiyuan, Xiao Guangde, Weng Lin, Qian Yonggen, Xu Zhubao, and Yu Xingqing, caused the opposition of the workers.

Wang Xianqing, the director of the Mediation Section, received them and expressed that it was all because the cadres did not return to work after the previous mediation. He promised to investigate thoroughly and handle it.</p>
<h3>Suspect in Kidnapping Case, Song Jiahua, Declared Not Guilty</h3>
<p>丨丨The Case of Being Accused of Robbery Still Needs Investigation丨丨</p>
<p>Xi Lusheng, a compradore of the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation from Dongting Mountain, was kidnapped by bandits at the Yizhixiang Vegetarian Restaurant on Fuzhou Road on December 6, 1929, but the attempt failed. Xi was killed by the bandits on the spot. Later, the detective arrested Shi Jinde and other bandits involved in the case and handed them over to the court, which sentenced them to death. During the court hearing, Shi and others confessed that Song Jiahua, a native of Tongzhou, also known as Song Are, was also a principal offender in the case. Because Song was at large, he could not be arrested. Recently, Pang Ruiqing and Shen Jinwen, Chinese detectives of the General Inspectorate, arrested Song at No. 2, Lane 257, Caishi Road, French Concession, and handed him over to the First Special Court for trial and detention. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the chief criminal judge of the First Special Court, opened the court for further trial. First, Wei Jinfu, the Chinese detective chief of the Hongkou Public Security Bureau, submitted the case to prove that Shi Jinde and others were arrested at that time because Song Jiahua reported to a detective Zhao of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who reported to me. After investigating, Song saw Shi and others using surveying equipment to measure in the road on Daxilu on a certain day. The next day, he saw the newspaper report that Zhang Shouyong's son, Xinglian, Hualian, the former vice-minister of finance, was kidnapped on Daxilu by bandits posing as surveyors. Song immediately knew that it must have been done by Shi and others, so he reported to Zhao, etc. Then, Zhao submitted the case, proving the same circumstances as Wei. When questioned, Song Jiahua confessed that the facts were that Shi and others knew that I had leaked the information, so they intentionally framed me, etc. Then, after the Public Security Bureau's lawyer, Ru Baoqi, and the defendant's lawyer, Fan Gang, debated with each other, Judge Qian declared in court that Song Jiahua was not guilty of the kidnapping and murder of the victim. The Public Security Bureau's lawyer immediately stood up and said that since Song Jiahua had been declared not guilty of the kidnapping part, there was still a case of being accused of stealing 46,000 yuan from the Four Lines Savings Society that had not been tried in the local court, and he should still be allowed to be detained and the trial should be rescheduled. The court approved it and ordered him to be returned to prison.</p>
<h3>The National Music Sound Film of the Datong Music Society Completed</h3>
<p>The Datong Music Society of this port recently cooperated with the Mingxing Company to produce a sound film of all the ancient and modern musical instruments, as well as ancient zithers, pipa, and large musical instruments, and transported it to the Chicago World's Fair in the United States as the first publicity of Eastern culture meeting the world. The association has been actively preparing for this for three months and completed filming last Sunday with excellent results. A test screening will be held in about two or three weeks. The content includes more than 160 kinds of musical instruments. On the committee side, Li Shizeng, Zhang Yuejun, Wang Xiaolai, and others were present. The name of the zither music is "Secluded Traces on a Sea Island," and the nature of the music is secluded and lonely, with a chilling air, which is a new work by Zheng Jun Jinwen, and is far beyond the reach of ordinary hands. The next is Wei Zhongle's pipa music, entitled "Great Han Breaks Chu," which is like an ancient war picture. The next is a nine-person ensemble of scenery, entitled "Spring River Flower Moon Night." Finally, there is a thirty-two-person ensemble of Eastern Music, which is a collection of ancient famous songs, suitable for large-scale banquets. The spirit is vibrant and the atmosphere is magnificent, which is different from the entertainment products in society. As soon as the company's manufacturing procedures are complete, it will be transported to Chicago. From now on, it can be said that my country's music has a considerable foundation and will no longer be ridiculed as a country without music. In total, the preparation fee for this event, in addition to the film and costumes, cost more than 600 yuan, which is not enough. Recently, because there are many people in the society who request to join the learning, buy musical instruments, and ask for works, the association plans to expand greatly in the near future to facilitate the progress.</p>
<h3>Japanese Merchants Dumping Light Bulbs</h3>
<p>In recent months, Japanese merchants have been dumping a large number of groceries and cotton cloths in China. Among them, light bulbs are being dumped most fiercely. The number in this port reached 2,557,600 in mid-March. According to the total amount of imports to China last year, it reached 1,230,000. In terms of price, it is 1.5 million gold units. Now, Japanese-made light bulbs are arbitrarily plummeting in price, even to 8 fen per bulb. Unscrupulous merchants are vying to buy them, change their appearance, and pass them off as domestic goods. Various goods of hatred have not restored their original state, but light bulbs have exceeded the total number of imports to China before the anti-Japanese goods movement began. In 1921, the total number of imports to China was only about 200,000. Until last year, it suddenly increased sharply, and there has been a sudden leap forward since this year. If this continues, it will be difficult for Chinese light bulb merchants to gain a foothold.</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Case of Beating a Worker to Death</h3>
<p>丨丨Defendant Declares Appeal Out of Dissatisfaction丨丨</p>
<p>Small workers at the Hongsheng Wharf in Pudong, for the sake of competing for business, a small worker, Gao Zuoying, was severely beaten and injured by the other party and died shortly thereafter. Later, the family of the deceased accused Wang Delin, Chen Guiqing, Ji Jinkui, Wang Daosheng, Wu Luhou, Liu Ali, and six others of being the murderers, and Wang Delin was accused of being the mastermind. After the local court had the corpse dissected, the investigation was completed and a public prosecution was filed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Guan opened the court to announce the verdict. Wang Delin was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment, and the others were sentenced to five years of imprisonment, and the deceased's brother, Gao Zuo, was compensated 600 yuan for his losses. The defendants all declared that they were not satisfied with the verdict and requested that an appeal be filed according to law. The official ordered that the appeal be allowed according to law and ordered them to be returned to prison.</p>

<p>Special Feature</p>
<h3>The Purpose of Publishing the Sixtieth Anniversary Yearbook of Shen Bao</h3>
<p>Shi Liangcai</p>
<p>A daily newspaper belongs to the history category but transcends it. Historical records document past events, while a daily newspaper changes with the times, doing more than merely recording. It also comments and analyzes, helping readers learn from the past and choose the good to follow. History is essentially a photograph of human evolution, and the daily newspaper is an even more advanced photograph, recording events and leaving examples for future generations, just as historical records do. But where historical records leave the responsibility of research and development to future generations, the daily newspaper does its best to research and develop while recording. Thus, the rise of the daily newspaper makes the record of human evolution more accurate.</p>
<p>The colleagues at our newspaper are keenly aware of our responsibility to the nation's life, cultural history, and have been diligently working on Shen Bao for sixty years. Looking back to the founding day, it was still in the eleventh year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing Dynasty. At that time, the Taiping and Nian rebellions had just been quelled, and Guanzhong, Longyou, and both the north and south routes of Tianshan were gradually settling down. An Englishman, Mr. B.S. Lyman, came to Shanghai to engage in business. Knowing that a daily newspaper could pioneer new trends and be profitable, he established this newspaper, inviting gentlemen such as Jiang Zhixiang, He Guisheng, Qian Xinbo, and Wang Ziquan to be the chief editors. These gentlemen, aware of the crucial relationship between the daily newspaper and culture and society, gladly set aside fame and fortune, working from dawn to dusk to promote its growth. At the same time, they also published a series of books, from classics to novels, totaling more than 160 titles. These books were intended to guide future scholars. Since then, the business has grown daily, and the circulation has expanded. During the Gengzi and Wuxu years, when national discipline was lacking, and foreign troubles arose, the people strengthened their determination to study politics and advocate for wealth and power, and the influence of Shen Bao also increased accordingly. The efforts of the predecessors have now become even more evident. Later, Huang Shiquan, Jin Jianhua, Lei Jianyao, Chen Jinghan, and Zhang Yunhe successively took charge of the editorial department. The newspaper was also taken back and operated by Chinese people in the late Guangxu years. The Revolution of 1911 shifted the nation's destiny, and the power of public opinion was significant. The efforts of our colleagues were minimal, but we do not dare to deny our contributions.</p>
<p>Regarding the composition of the newspaper's content, our colleagues have worked diligently to make progress every day. Generally speaking, in the early days of the newspaper, the format was new, with imperial court dispatches, commentaries, and news reports, but not many correspondences. After governance, the commentaries strived for precision and insight, the news reports specially commissioned reporters, and the news, in addition to temporarily occurring events, also included long articles. The postal correspondences were supplemented by exclusive telegrams, extending from this country to foreign countries. The pursuit of eye-catching headlines and substantial content has been continuously improving, which is already evident to everyone. As evidenced by the publications over the past sixty years, the people of this country should know that Shen Bao is responsible for history and culture and is also striving to stay ahead of the times, responding to the evolution of the environment, and pioneering new trends, seeking to fulfill its mission, which has never been absent from our minds. Time flies, and years pass like flowing water. Our colleagues follow in the footsteps of our predecessors, adding new knowledge, working tirelessly for sixty years. From one year to ten years, accumulating gradually and seeking truth, we did not dare to boast to the contemporary world. Until fifty years, half a century, our colleagues began to plan to commemorate this newspaper. Thus, there was the publication of "The Most Recent Fifty Years," which separately highlighted the major academic and political events of the past fifty years in the world, and commissioned experts to write about them. This fiftieth anniversary was used as an opportunity to try to take a further step in our work.</p>
<p>Since the publication of the fiftieth anniversary book, it has been widely circulated. Our colleagues have realized that what the people of this country need, in addition to the daily newspaper, is a comprehensive and systematic writing. Shen Bao is encouraging itself with the responsibility of promoting culture and is also encouraging itself with adapting to the times, so for the needs of the readers, how can we stick to the old ways in the daily newspaper? Therefore, our colleagues are increasingly supervising each other, hoping to do their best to fulfill their responsibilities outside of the daily newspaper.</p>
<p>Ten years have passed in an instant. Now, Shen Bao has passed its sixtieth anniversary. On this occasion, in terms of business, we can indeed raise a glass to celebrate our achievements. In terms of responsibility, although our colleagues dare not slack off from morning to night, we still regret that, in addition to the daily newspaper, we have not been able to print more publications that are widely accessible. Moreover, last year's September 18th Incident, when the world was planning to save the Northeast to save the country, the pain of the loss of territory and the misery of the displaced people, we did not even have time to mourn, let alone celebrate? The colleagues at Shen Bao, feeling deeply moved, encouraged each other to develop the business further to commemorate this sixtieth anniversary, abandoning the customs of colorful banquets and focusing on their own responsibilities. To save the country from disaster and plan for survival, everyone must fulfill their responsibilities first. Our colleagues' abandonment of vanity to promote practical affairs should be welcomed by the world? Observing the needs of the times and focusing on our own mission, we will continue our efforts. Thus, this year, we first have the publication of a monthly magazine. The monthly magazine contains many systematic and lengthy works that can be used for general research, covering almost all scientific arts included in culture. The news section is also similar to the monthly records of the history department.</p>
<p>Since the science of statistics has become clear and the art of statistics has advanced, the evolution of human groups and the traces of social change can be seen in their true colors through numerical tables. As the Western saying goes, "Numbers do not lie," and the evidence of statistics surpasses written records. Collecting various statistics for easy reference is the responsibility of the yearbook. Therefore, in addition to the daily newspaper and the monthly magazine, this newspaper has also edited a yearbook, using the monthly magazine to assist the daily newspaper and adding the yearbook to make the daily newspaper and monthly magazine the warp and the yearbook the weft. Those who discuss current events and history can use the daily newspaper to record everything without omission, the monthly magazine to cite and summarize, and the statistical history table of the yearbook to encompass the daily newspaper and monthly magazine and supplement what they could not detail in the morning and evening or over the course of a month. Combining these three aspects, we can avoid the risk of omissions and the problem of tediousness.</p>
<p>Discussing current events and history, it is important to have accurate knowledge and detailed research. For one person to exhaustively study modern history, how does their ability compare to that of a newspaper with a communication network that spans from major cities to remote areas? How does their material compare to that of a newspaper that collects and searches diligently? The answer is obvious without further explanation. Now, our colleagues have been working on the daily newspaper for sixty years. With the passing of time, we have sought to compile supplementary historical tables and records, such as the monthly magazine and the yearbook, to comprehensively view and reflect, considering more than half of the past. Our colleagues dare not be complacent, but we are confident that we can provide a complete comprehensive history to meet the needs of the contemporary world. From now on, the daily newspaper will continue to be uniquely valuable in its role as a comprehensive chronological history. From now on, we will also publish supplementary materials on a yearly basis. Historical events and historical lessons will be given equal attention, creating a grand and impressive work.</p>
<p>Our colleagues have devoted themselves to the daily newspaper, and now we have seen the successive publication of the monthly magazine and the yearbook, the realization of our ideals has begun, and we can comfort each other. However, what our colleagues hope for from readers is just beginning. Our colleagues deeply know that the life of the nation depends on culture, and that which is passed down from culture endlessly is history. However, writing history is one thing, and using history is another. Human evolution, if we do not know its past, how can we plan for its future? Taking the past as a mirror, so that we know what to gain and lose, this is the effect of history. Our colleagues have fulfilled their due responsibilities and cannot help but look forward to readers using them.</p>
<p>The world is changing rapidly, and not only is China in a dangerous situation, urgently seeking governance, but the entire world is also in the midst of turmoil, unable to rest peacefully. Human groups seek happiness as their ultimate goal, but now, with the great chaos just beginning, the road to happiness is getting farther and farther away. Is it the fault of the government? Is it the fault of the economy? Is it the fault of the education? Is it the fault of the system? Those who aspire to seek the happiness of human groups must urgently research and explore this, and it cannot be delayed any longer. Those who seek governance take history as a mirror, while our colleagues take history as their task. There may be contributions to make, and we will use them as a starting point, so that in the future, with the legacy of culture and the lessons of history, we can restore order and return to governance.</p>

<p>Our colleagues are eagerly looking forward to and offering incense to celebrate, and the publication of the yearbook cannot be delayed any longer. We dare to cite this to describe the purpose of Shen Bao's publication of the Sixtieth Anniversary Yearbook. December 1932, Republic of China.</p>
<h3>Preface to the Shen Bao Yearbook</h3>
<p>Zhang Yunhe</p>
<p>The yearbook occupies an important position in the publishing world of various countries. Since the world's civilization has progressed day by day, the changes in events have become more and more complex, and the progress of all kinds of political, educational, industrial, commercial, economic, and social undertakings has also been rapid. Without a yearbook, there is no way to make annual comparisons; and without a yearbook, there is no way to provide reference for daily use; therefore, it is very obvious that the yearbook is necessary for people of all walks of life. Mr. Shi Liangcai, General Manager of this newspaper, said: "A daily newspaper provides readers with what it has gained in one day; a monthly magazine provides readers with what it has accumulated in one month. But what is gained in one day is very little. Even if it is accumulated to one month, although it can be observed more accurately and described systematically, the changes in events are instantaneous, and what is gained in one month is still fragmented and incomplete. Even if a person has a very strong memory, how can they store the thousands of things that have happened in a year in their brain, connect them, integrate them, and never forget them? The yearbook is to comb and clean up the gains of this one thousand, to replace people from all walks of life in remembering what cannot be remembered in the brain, and to leave the impression that cannot be left. Then, how can the making of the yearbook be stopped?" All my colleagues said it was good. Therefore, Mr. Zhang Zisheng was hired to manage the matter. Mr. Zhang is a scholar with accumulated learning and meticulous knowledge. He also got the assistance of financial and economic expert Sun Huairen and political and legal expert Zhang Zhuohan. The construction began in July last year. After ten months of hard work and repeated consideration, it was finally completed. Mr. Zhang Zisheng said: "There are several difficulties in this matter: it is difficult to be perfect in the initial stage of operation, one; the sources of materials are different, and they often contradict each other, and the statistics are especially difficult to be accurate, two; the space is limited, and the events are endless, and we are afraid of being too verbose, and we are also afraid of omissions, three; the world economy is vast and boundless, and it is especially difficult to choose to describe it incidentally, four; the changes in the world are unpredictable, and it becomes the past as soon as it is drafted, five. Because of these numbers, the investigators have repeatedly reviewed and re-examined what has been finalized, so the period is inevitably slightly extended." Mr. Zhang said this and expressed his apologies for not being satisfied, but it can also be seen his sincerity and diligence in doing things. The making of this book is not only to save memory and facilitate reading; it is actually closely related to the country and society. The progress and decline of our country's politics, military affairs, industry, commerce, education, academics, transportation, society, etc., are all related to the pain of our people, and the economy is especially the center of modern life. The economic situation of the world's powers is even more closely related to our country. Mr. Zhang paid special attention to this, worked hard to collect information, and enabled readers to know the rise and fall in this, to seek the way to survive in this world, and then to seek the way to improve themselves and strengthen themselves, then the necessity of this book for everyone can be known; and it can be said that it is of some help to the country and society. Therefore, I am happy to describe its origin to mark the eagerness of Manager Shi and the courage of Mr. Zhang in his work. As for whether the style of this book is complete and whether the collection is accurate and detailed, there are readers to criticize, so there is no need to add more. Those who were responsible for sub-editing, signing, checking, and interviewing for this project were Mr. Tang Gongxian, Mr. Chen Gengya, Mr. Jin Shuren, Mr. Huang Jiping, and Mr. Fang Zichuan. Mr. Zong Youze and Mr. Jiang Zhen left before they could finish their work. The specially invited writers were Mr. Chen Wenlu, Mr. Wu Lingdan (the national disaster in the past year), Mr. Jiang Jianren, Mr. Guo Lisan, Mr. Zhang Liuyun (air force), Mr. Wang Defa (fisheries), Mr. Liu Shimu (overseas Chinese affairs), Mr. Fang Dongan, Mr. Wang Weiqi (labor), Mr. Wu Juenong (rural and cooperative undertakings), Mr. Xu Shuling (Nanjing City), Mr. Xiao Bo (Hankou City), Mr. Xu Tiaofu (publishing), Mr. Li Jizhi (archaeology), Mr. Tang Jinggao, Mr. Jin Zhonghua, Mr. Wu Qianyao, Mr. Wu Du Ruo (world), Mr. Huang Youxiong (Nobel Prize and table of weights and measures) and other nineteen people; the two articles on party affairs construction were entirely based on the materials provided by Mr. Cui Weiwu and Mr. Zeng Yangfu. In summary, there were thirty-one people engaged in writing.</p>

<h3>Vocational Schools to be Set Up Independently Starting Next Year</h3>
<p>Encourage Private Organizations to Open Schools</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 19th) The Ministry of Education has prepared measures to rectify vocational schools across the country, stipulating that vocational schools should be set up independently starting next academic year.

<h3>Jiangsu Education Department Implements National Salvation Education</h3>
<p>Promulgates Implementation Guidelines to Inspire the Spirit of National Salvation,</p>
<p>Instills Knowledge of National Salvation, and Cultivates Skills of National Salvation</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang Communication) Zhou Fohai, Director of the Jiangsu Education Department, believes that to save the country from disaster, it is not possible to achieve the ultimate effect unless young people are cultivated, the masses are trained, and talents for national salvation are created from the root. Recently, he specially formulated the "Implementation Guidelines for National Salvation Education" and issued them to all schools and social education institutions under his jurisdiction for compliance, and plans to submit detailed plans to the department for approval and implementation. The guidelines are divided into three parts: secondary education, primary education, and social education, and the content is very practical. This is used to determine the ten-year education policy and prepare for long-term struggle, which is of great significance to the education policy. The following is an excerpt of the full text of his instructions to his subordinates: "The national struggle is based on strength, and the strength of the people is the key to victory or defeat. Today, the enemy is strong and the national crisis is urgent. Lack of preparation is not enough to resist insults, and empty words will only save the country. Moreover, judging the situation is not something that can be decided at one time, and revenge must be achieved with perseverance. Therefore, the current way to protect is to resist, and the merit of revival depends on education. It is the most urgent plan to determine the ten-year education policy and prepare for a long-term struggle. Young students are the treasure of the country and the backbone of national salvation in the future. However, their academic ability is not sufficient, and their blood is strong. Occasionally, they are motivated by righteous indignation and fail to weigh the situation carefully. They inevitably act impulsively. When they encounter resistance, they will give up their ambitions. Disheartened people are everywhere. This not only damages the vitality of the country but also causes hidden worries for the future. Therefore, young students must be able to thoroughly recognize the correct path of national salvation, cultivate the skills of national salvation, and practice hard without懈, so that what is accumulated in the heart is rich and what is displayed outside is great. As for the general public, their knowledge is not yet open, and they do not know the overall situation. Efforts should be made to enlighten them so that they can become aware and act on their own to overcome the crisis together in order to comply with the purpose of the national total mobilization. The department, in view of this, has specially formulated a "Implementation Guidelines for National Salvation Education in Jiangsu Province," which is divided into three parts: secondary education, primary education, and social education. It instructs all county, provincial, county, private secondary education, and social education institutions to comply with it, and also instructs them to formulate detailed implementation plans and report them for the record. It must be known that the implementation of national salvation education has a significant key in the education policy. It is hoped that you will supervise your colleagues and set an example with yourself, implement it practically, and do not regard it as a mere formality and perfunctory performance."</p>
<h3>Telegram from the Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Teachers' Association</h3>
<p>Only Through Struggle with Iron and Blood Can We Seek the Survival of Our Nation</p>
<p>The All-Jiangsu Provincial Middle School Teachers' Association sent a telegram via express mail, which stated: "To the Nanjing National Government and all elders, fathers, brothers, sisters, and compatriots, be advised: Since the loss of the Northeast and the subsequent fall of Jehol, the iron cavalry of the Japanese has been advancing aggressively, threatening to cross the Great Wall and engulf Peiping and Tientsin, and to swallow Shandong and Henan. The survival of the nation is hanging by a thread. The League of Nations has already mediated the September 18th Incident. We must not abandon ourselves today, negotiate with the Japanese, and willingly make a covenant of surrender, which would be ridiculed by the world. Today, we can only strive for the survival of our nation through struggle with iron and blood. Should there be anyone who disregards the will of the people, willingly accepts the Japanese yoke, follows their treacherous schemes, seeks compromise, and fails to rouse themselves to avenge our grievances, they are choosing the path to self-destruction, which we resolutely oppose. We earnestly hope that the government will swiftly recover the lost territories and drive out the Japanese invaders beyond the Yalu River, restoring our homeland and preserving our nation. We are willing to remain vigilant, exert ourselves in our teaching, and be the vanguard of patriotic men and women at the front. With the national crisis worsening daily, we should unite and strive for thorough implementation. We hope that the people of the country will rise up together to plan for this." Jiangsu Provincial United Association of Middle School Teachers and Staff.</p>

<h3>Yu Hongjun Expresses Views on the French Concession Authorities' Interference in Private Schools</h3>
<p>Will Definitely Lodge a Strong Protest</p>
<p>A reporter from the Daba Society interviewed Mr. Yu Hongjun, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, yesterday to discuss the following points: The reporter asked, "Recently, the French Concession authorities have been forcing our schools to suspend classes, which is likely to harm our country's educational administrative power. How will the Municipal Government handle this?" According to Mr. Yu's reply, the Education Bureau has not yet made a formal report on this matter. However, the concession is essentially leased territory, and all sovereignty within its boundaries still belongs to our country. If the French Concession authorities truly interfere with our country's educational administrative power, the Municipal Government must argue on the basis of reason and uphold our sovereignty, and cannot allow others to overstep their bounds.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Orders All Schools to Submit Student Registration Forms</h3>
<p>Including 45 Schools Such As Nanyang Girls' Middle School</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau issued an order yesterday to private schools such as Nanyang Girls' Middle School, stating: "It has been investigated that the method for schools to submit student registration information has been revised starting this semester, and student registration forms are now required. The detailed methods have also been notified and schools were ordered to submit them by a deadline. Now that the deadline has long passed, many have complied and submitted as ordered, but there are still quite a few who have not submitted, or even have not come to the Bureau to purchase the student registration forms. Such negligence is greatly hindering the progress of official business. Therefore, we hereby reissue this order, urging all schools that have not yet purchased student registration forms, or have already received them but have not yet submitted them, to promptly purchase and submit them separately, and to submit them to the Bureau by a specified date. With the implementation of the new methods by your schools, if you can truly abide by the Bureau's orders, the future verification of academic qualifications will undoubtedly be easier than before. Both the Bureau and your schools will benefit from this. We hope that all schools will understand this intention and promptly comply without fail." This order includes a list of schools that have not submitted student registration forms: Nanyang Girls' Middle School, Jianguo Middle School, Zhengfeng Middle School, Bowen Girls' Middle School, McLellan Middle School, Huadong Girls' Middle School, Peiming Girls' Middle School, Hujiang Affiliated Middle School, Datong Affiliated Middle School, Daxia Affiliated Middle School, Sino-German Midwifery School, Shanghai Middle School, Huahua Middle School, Minzhi Middle School, Qianye Middle School, YMCA Middle School, Qingxin Middle School, China Women's Physical Education School, Huiling Middle School, Fudan Experimental Middle School, Minli Middle School, Fudan Affiliated Middle School, Danhua Middle School, Liangjiang Women's Physical Education School, Minshi Middle School, Qingxin Middle School, Youth Middle School, East Asia Physical Education College, Shanghai Normal School for Young Children, Xinmin Middle School, Yucai Middle School, Guangdong Middle School, Yunzhong Girls' Middle School, Chizhi Affiliated Middle School, Aiguo Girls' Middle School, China Vocational School, Zhirenyong Girls' Middle School, Sino-Western Girls' Middle School, Qiaoguang Middle School, Southeast Women's Physical Education School, Nanyang Middle School, Aiqun Girls' Middle School, Shenmei Girls' Middle School, and Guanghua Affiliated Middle School.</p>

Today is the day for our country's two great generals, Shen Lince and Zhang Yingda, to compete for the semi-finals.

<h3>The Iron Exhibition and National Products</h3>
<p>— Yang Fei</p>
<p>The Ministry of Railways, to awaken national awareness, promote the sale of national products, develop the national economy, increase railway transportation, promote agricultural and commercial prosperity, and regulate supply and demand, is holding a National Railway Line Product Exhibition at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on Rue Pere Robert, south of Avenue Foch, Shanghai, from April 10th to 30th. The exhibition will collect products from along various railway lines and from major commercial ports and cities, and will create various charts to show the status of production, sales, and transportation. The intention is that the advancement of railway freight business requires the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce along the lines, and the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce also depends on the progress of railway transportation. Agriculture and industry can be called the producers of goods, merchants the traders of goods, and railways the transporters of goods. All three are closely linked to the improvement of product quality, the increase of quantity, the flexibility of transportation, and the expansion of sales. However, in ordinary times, the three parties of production, sales, and transportation often have no common ground for exploration, no way to cooperate on improvements, no understanding of each other's difficulties, and no realization of mutual cooperation. Barriers arise and suffering follows, which is a major obstacle to the future of the national products business. Now, the Ministry of Railways can gather products from various railway lines in one place, and gather the three parties of production, sales, and transportation in one hall. Its deep intentions and careful design are admirable. The reporter visited for a week and noted that the collection was not yet fully comprehensive, and the products were not yet fully complete. But by glimpsing through a tube, one can already see a glimpse of the whole picture. The agricultural products listed in the exhibition seemed to be mostly from the Jinpu Line, the specialty products were led by the Beining Line, the handicrafts were prominent from the Huning and Huhang Lines, and the mineral and forestry products were mainly from the PingSui and PingHan Lines. The LongHai Line still had much to be developed, and the Jiaoji Line also felt underdeveloped. The various maps of production and transportation of various routes already show a general outline, as clear as one's own palm. However, from my perspective, the following points seem to require serious attention in order to achieve practical results in developing the future of national products.</p>
<p>1.  There are many raw materials along the various railway lines that are of extremely low value, which can be greatly used by the industrial sector. However, because the organization of transportation agencies is not prepared, there are neither wide warehouses nor special vehicles, nor loading and unloading machinery, complete vehicle yards, and large-scale equipment such as docks, ferries, and barges, which are necessary tools for freight transportation. The production sector wants to transport raw materials to various places, but their ambitions cannot be fulfilled. As a result, suppliers have no way to supply, and seekers have no way to purchase. The future of national products is greatly affected. Therefore, various lines must urgently improve transportation facilities.</p>
<p>2.  The various railway lines are rich in agricultural products and many industrial products. However, before the railway authorities were responsible for transportation, they paid no attention to business matters. There was no refrigeration to store fresh goods, nor ventilation and warming methods. Goods were left to rot. All goods were neither picked up and delivered by vehicles nor linked by transportation. Freight rates were inconsistent, consignment procedures were troublesome, station staff created difficulties, and road workers arbitrarily demanded bribes. The suffering of farmers, workers, and merchants is sufficient to hinder the development of national products. Therefore, various lines must urgently improve the management of transportation, rectify the discipline of road workers, and reform all bad habits of service personnel.</p>
<p>3.  The products of various railway lines include many exquisite ones, but also many that are crude and simple. Most of them are driven to decline by the backwardness of production technology. For example, the uneven quality of raw silk, the declining methods of tea making, the degeneration of silkworm breeds in Zhejiang, and the decline of the porcelain industry in Jiangxi are all symptoms of disease in the production sector. To seek development, efforts must be made from all sides to assist and promote its progress. On the one hand, it all depends on striving for the technologicalization of production methods so that large-scale production can be achieved to resist imported goods. Our national product counterparts can survive in the market filled with foreign goods. As for the sales aspect, it depends on the improvement of transportation, and it is necessary to gather strength to make sales centralized and cooperative. Centralization means strong ability, and cooperation means reduced costs. This greatly helps the progress of national products, and it depends on the full cooperation of both industry and commerce.</p>
<p>National Products Talk</p>
<h3>Management Systems and the National Products Movement (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Gu Yuan</p>
<p>After the Industrial Revolution, the industrial systems of Europe and the United States transformed families into factories, and both the form and content underwent significant changes. Management methods evolved from simple to complex. To adapt to the needs of the environment, after long-term research and improvement, they have reached a scientific level. In recent times, this has evolved into industrial rationalization. All factory management involves meticulous design and detailed methods. Whether it's an action or a movement, it cannot deviate from the track. This has indeed been quite effective in increasing production and raising living standards in Europe, America, and Japan.</p>
<p>The national character of our country has always been known for its conservatism. Dealing with things is casual, far less tense and meticulous than Westerners. For thousands of years, we have adhered to the handicraft system without considering improvements. After the opening of the sea, impacted by Western civilization, all old methods naturally cannot compete with advanced industrial systems. Those who are somewhat aware of current affairs realize that national survival requires following the footsteps of Europe and the United States and improving systems. Therefore, as a result of promoting industry and commerce in recent years, management systems have also gradually attracted the attention of the general public. Recently, further influenced by the industrial rationalization movement in various European and American countries, the people of our country are sparing no effort in researching and promoting management systems. There are organizations such as the Industrial and Commercial Management Association, and other similar groups, and management research societies within various commercial institutions are numerous. The impact has indeed had an effect on increasing production efficiency, so that more and more factories and stores are adopting new management systems. In particular, the reform of the accounting system is even more obvious. This trend can be reflected by looking at the development of the accountant profession in recent years.</p>
<p>Some people believe that the progress of industrial and commercial management in our country, like that of Europe, America, and Japan, seems to have no reason to oppose, except for fueling unemployment, which we will discuss separately. But we must know that the progress of management methods in Europe, America, and Japan allows all aspects to adapt to the new environment, and everything is sought from within. Therefore, the reform of the system is accompanied by progress in everything else, so that all the benefits can be obtained without any drawbacks. Looking back at our country, the bottom layer of society still maintains its ancient form. On the one hand, in order to imitate Westernization, Western management systems are forcibly transplanted in a crude manner. On the surface, it seems that the system has undergone considerable reform, but comparing the system and the social environment reveals a great mismatch. The most obvious phenomenon is that the Westernization of the management system is enough to increase trade deficits.</p>
<h3>In Praise of the National Products Company</h3>
<p>— Yin Ge</p>
<p>Yin Ge lives inland and heard that a national products company has opened in Shanghai, located in the Continental Marketplace on Nanjing Road. Immediately took the train to Shanghai, specifically to go and pay respects. Arrived at the company and looked carefully. Everything to eat, wear, and use is available. Not only does it seem that China's manufacturing industry has made obvious progress. Moreover, this company is indeed the first department store in Shanghai that purely sells national products, so I felt very happy as soon as I walked into the company. In 1930, Yin Ge stayed in Tokyo, Japan, for a month, and went to several department stores in Tokyo, such as Matsuzakaya, Mitsukoshi Kimono Store, and Shirokiya. I feel that they have one admirable aspect, which is that the goods sold on all floors are Japanese products. That is, their national products. Our department stores in Shanghai are indeed not small in scale, and the goods are extremely beautiful and exquisite. What is a pity is that they cannot be like the stores in Tokyo, where every item is a national product.</p>
<p>Great. Now there is a department store where every item is a national product. Isn't this the most worthy of praise thing in the Shanghai market?</p>
<p>National Products Discussion</p>
<h3>Organizing Local Specialties</h3>
<p>— Tian Ran</p>
<p>From the impression gained from participating in the Chicago Expo preliminary exhibition, the quality of local specialties is higher than that of emerging industries, which shows that the future of China's production sector has not yet reached an extremely developed stage. Moreover, these so-called local specialties participating in the exhibition are mostly those that have already been improved, and there are countless others that have been forgotten. Therefore, we must propose the slogan of organizing local specialties.</p>
<p>We naturally do not want to be antique dealers, but many of China's local specialties not only have the potential to occupy a position in the domestic market but also to be promoted to the world market. However, due to economic and technical reasons, they are gradually disappearing due to decline. Many of these forgotten national products are very practical. When they are declining and disappearing, we often use foreign goods because we do not know that there are national products, and we even explain ourselves by thinking that there are no substitutes. How heartbreaking is this! Regarding the technical aspect, Jiangxi linen and porcelain have given us factual proof that organizing existing industries is always cheaper than creating new industries. Why do our entrepreneurs let profits be abandoned on the ground and stand by idly?</p>
<p>From an economic point of view, organizing local specialties in the inland is more reliable than opening small-scale factories in the city. Housing, production materials, raw materials, and wages are all cheaper than in the city, and it is even more helpful in regulating the local economy. In terms of management, factory construction, and sanitary equipment, there are more opportunities for design and research than in the city, without being limited by the environment. Even if we take a step back, in the process of organization, even without obvious success and progress, the products produced in the same way as in the past still have a considerable sales market, so this cannot be called a risky business.</p>
<p>Because of the bankruptcy of the inland agricultural economy, there is a great need for the promotion of side businesses and the regulation of finance. Going to the inland to organize local specialties can accommodate the surplus capital of the city on the one hand, and is of great help to the inland on the other hand. However, this is not without benefit to the city. It increases the purchasing power of the inland, reduces the trend of abnormally concentrated urban immigration, and is of great benefit to the entire national economy!</p>
<p>Therefore, we hope that ambitious producers will not forget to organize local specialties. General national product companies should make full use of local specialties and promote local specialties as much as possible.</p>
<h3>Responsibility</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>Many people are gathering and discussing. A says, "The Northeast is now almost completely lost. In this critical autumn of survival, what should we ordinary people do?" B says, "Indeed, if things continue like this, if we don't resist, they will attack every day. If we wait until later, our key points will be trampled and eaten. By that time, trying to find a way will probably be too late!" C says, "I have an analogy for what the two of you said. China is like an orange, round and full, originally growing very well. However, once a little bit is bad, we seem not to see it and ignore it. Later, that little bit of badness slowly expands. By this time, it can no longer be eaten. That is, China did not know to get up and find a way when it was slightly invaded. In the future, when enemy footprints are full of the country, it will be truly like a spoiled orange." D says, "What Mr. C said is very thorough. However, compared with the degree of a spoiled orange, China has now reached the half-spoiled period. So if we don't all get up and urgently seek to save it, we can say (it's over)!" E says, "I have heard all of your arguments. I think that people like us can't hold spears or shoot arrows, but can only do some important work in the rear!" "..."</p>
<p>I listened to the discussions of many people, and they were mostly very patriotic remarks. Summarizing their words, it is inseparable from the word "responsibility." I think that in the world, being a person, it can be said that no matter who, is inseparable from the word "responsibility." If there is a person without responsibility, that person is a dead person who has lost life, not a living person who can speak!</p>
<p>The responsibility of a child is to study, the responsibility of a woman is for everything in the family, the responsibility of a man is for his own duties..., but today's most important responsibility is not to be borne separately by anyone, but for the national people to bear this major responsibility together, so that they can complete their great work.</p>
<p>"The production of a country is to supply the needs of a country's people." This is what I said long ago. Only we Chinese are willing to exhaust our own essence and use the dross of foreigners. In this way, from shallow to deep, relying on each other for decades, the Chinese people's minds have been occupied by foreign goods, and what about national products? In their minds, especially the general self-proclaimed modernizing central figures, I think there is not even a trace. One day, I saw a self-proclaimed modern couple in the electrical department of the China National Products Company. The woman pointed to the hanging chandelier and said, "This is clearly a foreign product. How can Chinese people make such a chandelier!" The man smiled and said, "If Chinese people could make such a chandelier, they would have been strong long ago, and they would not have been so humiliated by Japan!" The woman grinned and walked away!</p>
<p>Ah! What a bold Chinese person! You actually look down on Chinese people like this! You say that the American chandelier is a foreign product. How do you see that it is a foreign product? Here, I want to mention the word "responsibility" again. This is the responsibility of speaking. When you say such a thing, have you ever thought about China's industry? Although it cannot be said to be a prosperous era now, the era of sprouting is recognized by everyone. In the sprouting era of Chinese industry, we Chinese people all have the qualifications of gardeners, and we are too late to do our best to protect it, but you want to destroy it for no reason. You must know that shooting arrows like you is just a word to yourself; how sad is it in the heart of the producer when they hear it! Then we can know that even for the small act of saying a word, we must take responsibility!</p>
<p>The Chinese people's fondness for using foreign goods, in today's long history, can be said to be "hereditary." Suppose that in the past, the grandfather's silk robe was worn out and no longer needed, and the son wore it. The son wore it out and no longer needed it, and it was altered to be worn by the grandson; now the pattern has changed. In the past, it was Chinese goods, but now foreign goods are used to pass it down!</p>
<p>The Chinese people of today should be shouldering your own responsibilities now! Now is not the same as before. China's science has progressed, industry has progressed, and everything has made considerable progress. The four major needs of life, clothing, food, housing, and transportation, can all be supplied by national products. The general Chinese people who like to use foreign goods turn your responsibility around, because you spend money to buy foreign goods, and you spend money to buy Chinese goods; you spend more money to buy foreign goods, and you spend less money to buy Chinese goods; you spend more money to buy foreign goods to show respect to foreigners, and you spend less money to buy Chinese goods to benefit the people's livelihood. Not only that, but the major responsibility can be fully shouldered, from near to far, and the entire nation that is about to sink can be saved! That is, the discussions of many people earlier can get a good result.</p>
<p>All Chinese people should understand what the current responsibility is! But you must never put this major responsibility behind you in the future and continue to be like me: "Advising and criticizing, but not acting!"</p>
<h3>The Cosmetics Industry in Shanghai</h3>
<p>— Song Lu</p>
<p>The giant wheel of the times is constantly advancing, and all things in society have undergone dramatic changes, especially the new and old metabolism in industry, which has significant changes. Taking the cosmetics industry as an example, in the past 20 years, due to the dumping of foreign goods in China, the rise of boycott trends, the expansion of national patriotic thought, and the evolution of chemical technology, as far as the port of Shanghai is concerned, cosmetics factories have sprung up vigorously. No fewer than 50 or 60 have been established successively. Up until recently, the production and sales of cosmetics in the port of Shanghai have reached 8 million yuan annually. The old rouge and face powder have naturally declined with the elimination of the times, and the business has plummeted. The dumping of Japanese goods in China has finally been given to the efforts and struggles of the Chinese people, so that it has no foothold in our country's market. According to the survey of the Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association last year, Japanese cosmetics only account for 1% of our country's sales, which is also enough to be a self-consolation for the efforts to promote national products, and further increases our enthusiastic expectation for "industrial salvation."</p>
<p>The new cosmetics industry has a history of less than 30 years in China. The first one established was Hong Kong's Kwong Sang Hong, and the Two Girls Flower Water it produced was also popular for a while. The first one established in Shanghai was the China Chemical Industry Society. The Three Stars toothpaste produced by the society has annual sales of hundreds of thousands of yuan, which is not only the most excellent toothpaste among national products, but also relies on this to resist the aggression of many foreign goods and recover a part of the rights for the country. The Family Industrial Society started with a small scale and issued Invincible paper-wrapped tooth powder. When the May Fourth Movement was surging, the society took advantage of this opportunity to actively promote it. In a few years, it replaced the Japanese diamond lion brand. Although Yonghe Industrial Company does not have huge planning, it has also gained a considerable position in the domestic cosmetics industry due to the large number of products and the effectiveness of sales. In addition, those who also operate cosmetics in the pharmacy industry, such as the elegant cream of the Mainland Pharmacy, the star flower water of the China-West Pharmacy, and the baby face of the China-France Pharmacy, also sell well. The rest of the small-scale factories are no less than dozens, with capital ranging from 5,000 yuan to 20,000 or 30,000 yuan. The annual turnover ranges from about 10,000 yuan to 70,000 or 80,000 yuan. The most popular products are snow cream, flower water, hair growth water, tooth powder, toothpaste, and honey gum, powder, etc.</p>
<p>There are also soaps that are related to cosmetics. Although soap is not a cosmetic, it is also a necessary item for washing. In terms of its function, it has the same meaning as toothpaste and tooth powder. Therefore, relatively large-scale cosmetics factories also attach soap making, such as: China Chemical Industry Society, Kwong Sang Hong, Yonghe Industrial Company, etc. The annual sales of soap are also quite considerable. As for factories that specialize in soap making, there are Huafeng Soap Factory, Central Soap Factory, Aihua Soap Factory, and China Xingji Factory, etc., and the business of Huafeng and Central Soap Factories is particularly large, with annual sales of more than 200,000 or 300,000 yuan.</p>
<p>In recent years, the degree of extravagance of the Chinese people is directly proportional to the increase in life, especially the general modern women have a particularly deep psychology of superstitious foreign goods, so the sales of noble Western cosmetics in China are really alarming. In order to resist, national product merchants have to imitate the decoration as closely as possible to foreign goods. Even many national cosmetics completely delete Chinese characters, and the posters are full of foreign characters. Some even title the names similar to Western translations. However, as a result, although it can be welcomed by some people, those modern women who are extremely extravagant will still not do without French perfumes worth more than ten yuan a bottle. "There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart!" How can such a pro-foreign psychology prevent national product merchants from feeling a major blow.</p>
<p>As for the sales of Japanese goods in China, according to the survey of the Shanghai Cosmetics Industry Association, the annual sales are only 340,000 yuan. The products are mainly the Twin Beauty brand of Taiyodo and the Seven Star Honey Ointment transported from Osaka. In addition, the lion brand toothpaste and tooth powder of Kobayashi Store have not completely disappeared in China. This point still hopes for the continued efforts of national product manufacturers!</p>
<h3>Production in Consumption</h3>
<p>— Ming Feng</p>
<p>We want to fulfill our responsibility as a member of society and the nation, so that we can have a clear conscience. At the very least, we should do some beneficial work for the public. This so-called beneficial work indeed includes a wide range of things. However, the best work is work in production. For example, farming and manufacturing are all productive work.</p>
<p>The above is what is called "production as production." Now I want to talk about production in consumption. When a person consumes, what production can be said? You don't know that when you consume, whether you eat, wear, or use, if you can eat domestic goods, wear domestic goods, and use domestic goods, then the domestic production industry will naturally develop day by day because of the expansion of sales. If the things you eat, wear, and use are all foreign goods, then the foreign production industry will indeed develop day by day because our people love to use imported goods, while the domestic production industry will shrink day by day because of the decreasing sales. Therefore, if you can consume domestic goods when you consume, this consumption is production.</p>
<h3>Me and National Goods</h3>
<p>— Pu Manbin</p>
<p>The Problem of Gift-Giving: The most complicated issue in my family is gift-giving. Red and white invitations arrive constantly, for weddings, funerals, birthdays, the first month anniversary of a newborn, first birthdays, moving celebrations, opening ceremonies, and even performing meritorious deeds for the deceased. People respectfully send an invitation, and aside from unintentional forgetting, how can one ignore them? My husband composes poems and writes couplets, which is also one of his morning tasks. "A scholar's favor is worth half a sheet of paper," so the cost is low, but even so, couplets and standing scrolls cost thirty to forty yuan per month. In the early days of the Home Improvement Society, Mr. Shen Xinqing, Mr. Huang Renzhi, and others proposed ways to save on gift-giving, suggesting that except for special relationships, the maximum for ordinary gifts should be one yuan. Later, Mr. Wang Zhixin proposed printing a special kind of gift certificate for members of the society to use, all with the intention of showing frugality amidst extravagance. Now, I think we are all advocating for the era of national goods, and the best way to give gifts is to give national goods. However, there are too many types of national goods, and everyone has different tastes. If I sincerely give someone a gift, but they have no use for it, then of course they won't be happy. Moreover, candies and pastries easily spoil and become useless over time. My husband once discussed with Mr. Xu Yangnan about packaging national fabrics into gift boxes as gifts, which would be very valuable. I heard that Mr. Xu has already implemented this. But the most suitable thing is national goods gift certificates, which can be used to redeem goods or cash, making it convenient for everyone. Since we started doing this, we feel that it benefits both ourselves and others. I have already told my relatives and friends about this at the Home Improvement Society, and I hope they will all try it. This is also a small responsibility for us women in promoting national goods.</p>
<p>Killable Scoundrels: One day, I took my child and unintentionally walked into a store in the French Concession. I went inside to take a look and suddenly saw a shop assistant using a trick to remove the Japanese brand from a piece of inferior goods and replace it with a national brand. He looked up and saw me, and immediately put it away, looking embarrassed, as if his conscience had been pricked. I sighed and said to him, "I know what you're doing. I advise you to awaken your conscience and leave some integrity for the sake of the Chinese people." It was like playing the lute to a cow. How could these despicable merchants talk about loving or not loving the country? The shop assistant is not good, but he is also pitiful. He has to do this to keep his job. The most hateful and deserving of death are the unpardonable bosses.</p>
<p>Respectable Shop Assistant: When I returned home, my husband said that a shop assistant from a foreign cloth store had come to tell him that his store specialized in selling inferior goods and replacing the labels with national brands. "I can't bear to do this anymore, so I painfully resigned." This shop assistant had the spirit of "starving to death is a small matter, losing integrity is a big deal." We greatly respect him.</p>
<p>The Small Ball Case: My son, A-Wei, loves to play with balls the most. One day, he saw in the newspaper that "Small balls are Japanese goods," and he immediately wrote a letter to the little reporter, asking him to frankly expose the market that sold them. A-Quan said that he was meddling, but A-Wei said, "This is the responsibility that children should have in the national goods year."</p>
<h3>A National Goods Family</h3>
<p>— Zhicheng</p>
<p>What constitutes an exemplary family worthy of praise and admiration?</p>
<p>Of course, there are many aspects, such as harmony between husband and wife, a good family financial situation, and cleanliness and literacy. However, we must recognize that it must be a national goods family.</p>
<p>Because families that use foreign goods have not yet clarified their most important national concepts, and they remain indifferent to the national economy. If they worship foreign goods and ignore national goods, they are simply families worthy of condemnation. How can they serve as our models?</p>
<p>So-called foreign goods, even if they represent modernity or brightness, also represent luxury. Exemplary families must promote frugality, so using national goods is most appropriate. They are, of course, loyal customers of national goods companies. Therefore, only national goods families are worthy of being called exemplary families.</p>
<p>The mistress of an exemplary family must be wise and talented, handling everything in an organized manner and calculating the value of everything. If she blindly worships foreign goods, if she does not understand the use of national goods substitutes, if she has no strong faith in national goods, how can she build an exemplary family worthy of emulation!</p>
<p>For the children of exemplary families, I hope they can be the masters of the new era. For their strong self-confidence and the awakening of their national consciousness, we must build a national goods family as a good educational environment.</p>
<p>Naturally, everyone hopes to establish an exemplary family, and everyone can work hard to build one, but we believe that it must also be a national goods family.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Factory Health</h3>
<p>— Xu Nangong</p>
<p>:: :: :: :: :: :: :: ::</p>
<p>In the midst of the enthusiastic national goods movement, it is indeed necessary to encourage the public to unanimously advocate for and use national goods, so that national goods can become widespread in the market and penetrate into inland cities and towns. But if we want the foundation of using national goods to be solid and to have a continuous supply of products, it depends on the health of the manufacturing factories themselves. Healthy factories produce superior products, and exquisite goods can be widely promoted. This is a natural principle, so if we want to revitalize national goods, we must seek the health and stability of factories.</p>
<p>So-called health and stability are not only determined by the size of the capital or the amount of production. Abundant capital is indeed the primary requirement of a factory, but the person in charge must have the ability to manage and allocate it well, which is also a key factor for success. On the other hand, even if one has a large amount of capital but lacks the ability to manage it, success is not guaranteed. As for the products, simply pursuing quantity without seeking quality, and producing crude and shoddy goods, will inevitably lose the trust of consumers. Therefore, we say that health is not limited to this. It requires strict organization and management, and thorough and accurate planning of equipment. It also requires keen observation.</p>
<p>The convenience of a factory's administration and operations depends on complete organization and legal management. Otherwise, the work will be scattered and disorganized, leading to mutual evasion of responsibility and a lack of people in charge. How can such a situation achieve satisfactory results? Therefore, a factory's affairs must be differentiated according to the nature of the work, with departments and sections set up to specialize in each task. Then, no matter how big or small the matter, there will be someone specifically responsible for it. Because of the complexity of the departments, there must be legal management to reward or punish the diligence or laziness of the work and the quality of the products. As a result, the factory's order will be stable, the discipline will be strict, and the development of the business will follow.</p>
<p>To increase work efficiency, it is necessary to first have thorough equipment, such as cleanliness, sanitation, safety facilities, and convenient food and lodging. This will stabilize the lives of employees, allow them to focus on their work, and increase their enthusiasm, which in turn will increase efficiency. To reduce costs, it is necessary to have accurate calculations, such as raw material procurement and labor allocation. Determine which raw materials should be increased or decreased, and how much labor is required for each part, so that no item is stockpiled or lacking, or too busy or too idle. Encourage benefits, eliminate malpractices, distribute evenly, and control waste, then costs will be lower and products will be easier to sell.</p>
<p>At the same time, the person in charge of a factory must have keen thinking and a long-term vision, observing social needs and being familiar with market conditions. Then they will not blindly manufacture goods that do not meet social psychology and needs. Because the enjoyment of material goods changes with the trend of the times, it is necessary to adapt to social psychology and make improvements, so that goods will not stagnate and will be easily circulated.</p>
<p>The above is only a general outline of the internal facilities. Other aspects regarding products and business will be discussed later due to limited space.</p>
<h3>Female Students and National Goods</h3>
<p>— Ms. Xiao Na</p>
<p>In schools, we can see that the clothes, items, and everything else used by the general female students are all foreign goods. They are either American goods, French goods, or perhaps British goods, Japanese goods. In short, you can't find any domestic goods.</p>
<p>But having said that, there are already several schools that have issued orders prohibiting the purchase of foreign goods and requiring the use of national goods! But it is never thorough, it is just a formality. If you don't believe me, on Sundays or holidays, you can still see them in the school district, wearing georgette and Indian silk clothes, flesh-colored silk stockings, and high-heeled leather shoes, with makeup on their faces, walking in a swaying manner, just like prostitutes. In their minds, they think that if they don't dress like this, they won't attract people's attention, and they can't show the nobility of students without using foreign goods!</p>
<p>Alas! Students are an educated class! They are the future masters of China! And female students are no exception, aren't they? Don't they know about the situation in North China? Don't they know that the national crisis is becoming more and more urgent? Don't they know the danger of economic oppression by imperialism? Don't they know their own responsibilities? I think they should know! Naturally, they should immediately rise up and carry out the task of saving the country!</p>
<p>What is the task of saving the country? It is nothing more than abandoning foreign clothes and accessories, throwing away cosmetics and other consumables, and promoting national goods! Use the position of the educated class to persuade women to buy and use national goods, and at the same time, continue to devote themselves to the advancement of academics. That is what female students should do!</p>
<p>New Industry Introduction</p>
<h3>A Kind of National Goods Worth Introducing</h3>
<p>— Huai</p>
<p>Since the government ordered haircuts in the Republic of China, twenty-two years have passed. Hair clippers used in barbershops have never been produced domestically. And those that have been sold in the market have all been Japanese goods sold by Han and Yang Trading Company. Because the hair quality of white people is softer, European and American hair clippers all have twenty-five teeth, which are not suitable for the application of Chinese people. According to statistics, the import of this item from Japan last year reached a huge amount of two million four hundred thousand. Now, the Lifeng Hair Clipper Factory has spent several years of research and meticulous manufacturing, and has achieved excellent results. After being tested by major barbershops, they are all satisfied. The knife has fifteen teeth, and its back is slightly curved. The length of the haircut can be adjusted as desired. Its price is cheaper than Japanese goods. It has been officially shipped, with the word "Li" as the trademark. The factory is located in Zhihe Lane, Roberts Road in this city. I think that in the future, the factory's products will surely sell well throughout the country. It is also good news in the voice of advocating national goods.</p>
<p>Visit Notes</p>
<h3>National Goods Displayed in the Jiaotong University Industrial Exhibition</h3>
<p>— Zhenmu</p>
<p>Indeed, in this exhibition, the exhibits of national goods industry are not as many or as good as those of foreign goods; but in terms of the quality and quantity of national goods, they have given the audience a considerable understanding, knowing that many daily necessities of foreign goods can now be replaced by domestic products made by Chinese people themselves. The reporter then introduced them.</p>
<p>The application of batteries is essential for radio reception and transmission, as well as all wired and wireless telegraphs, telephones, bells, and other machines. Batteries are divided into dry and wet types, and there are also storage batteries, with many styles. Batteries were originally foreign goods, but in recent years, Chinese people have also been able to make them themselves. Among the exhibits, the storage batteries of Tanpan, Shengbo, and Jianhua are quite elaborate, and the lead plates and acid solutions used are also very precise. Compared with foreign goods, they are not inferior. It is said that the Electricity Bureau of the Ministry of Communications is now installing Tanpan batteries to replace foreign goods.</p>
<p>Bricks and tiles are made of clay heated, with red and blue depending on the firing temperature, and milky white and egg yolk depending on the material. The style and size vary with the mold. The exhibiting manufacturers include Taishan's red and blue bricks and tiles, and Yizhong's colored magnetic tiles. The patterns of these magnetic tiles can be designed by the user themselves for pre-production.</p>
<p>The import of paint costs millions of dollars a year, which is an urgent task for Chinese people to rise up and seek to recover. The raw materials are mainly vegetable and animal oils, stone powder, and fats, with the addition of various metal powders and pigments for coloring. In addition to the paint factory of the school's research institute giving a public demonstration at the conference, there are also Zhenhua's Flying Tiger brand double flag brand, and Yuanfeng's Fengzi brand, all of which are top choices.</p>
<p>Round nails are small items, but they also come from foreign countries, resulting in a large outflow of cash every year. Now, the Gongqin Iron Factory and the China Nail Manufacturing Company are publicly demonstrating nail-making technology at the conference. The machines are divided into three sets: a motor, a coiling machine, and a nail-cutting machine. The coiling machine is equipped with iron wire of varying thickness. When the motor is turned on, the iron wire advances and enters the nail-cutting machine. After three movements, a nail is produced, consisting of a flattened round head, a sharpened tail, and a separation of the nail from the machine. According to the reporter's estimate, the machine can produce eighty to ninety small nails per minute.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are also the centrifugal water pump and washbasin blank-making machine from the China Iron Factory. The blank-making machine works by using a round iron sheet to stamp out a model blank. According to the reporter's calculation, it can press out about seven or eight blanks per minute. Bakelite from the Yaguang Factory. Bakelite is not wood, but a mixture of organic substances. It is widely used in the manufacture of electrical appliances, children's toys, daily necessities, fountain pen barrels, etc. Its characteristics are that it does not conduct electricity, does not conduct heat, and cannot be broken. Its disadvantage is that it burns when exposed to sparks. Most of these items are foreign goods, but now there are domestic products. I hope Chinese people will use them. And the economic oil stove of the Zhongxin Factory. The small ones are five or six inches high, and the large ones are less than one meter, all divided into three parts: a base, a wick, and an upper body. It uses kerosene as fuel, does not require inflation, and lights with a single spark. It is convenient to carry and economical to use. It is said that three ounces of kerosene can burn for one hour.</p>
<p>In addition, there is also the Zhendan's pharmaceutical foam fire extinguisher, the motor, generator, engine, and water pump of the Xinzhong Engineering Company, all kinds of electric fans of the Huasheng Electric Factory; the automobile of the Minsheng Factory, the stone powder of the Shunchang Company; the cement of the China Company; the prize medals of the Standard Company; the rubber products of the Dachina Company; the cosmetics of Samsung and Huanan; the stationery of Zhonghua and Zhongyi; the textile machine of the Zhuyat Iron Factory; the lift-line ribbed knitting machine of the Lichang Factory; and the road roller, electric bellows, and transportation vehicles of the Yuanda Iron Factory. All of these are exquisitely made by Chinese people, which shows the general level of modern industrial products in our country.</p>

<h3>Tight Foreign Exchange Settlement</h3>
<p>The market remains brisk.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign exchange settlement situation at banks remained cumbersome and relentless. Foreign banks also took in a lot of cash, sparing no effort to absorb cash. Therefore, most of the silver in the market is likely to be gathered into foreign coffers. The discount rate for foreign exchange transactions in the market was slightly lower than before, calculated at four percent. The premium for silver dollars plus water was slightly better by one or two percent, calculated at fifteen or sixteen percent. Although bank notes are used directly in circulation in the market now, there are slight discrepancies when settling with financial institutions. Payments require interest to be calculated one day later. Therefore, most colleagues only use bank notes for direct settlement up to 500 yuan. For larger amounts, silver dollars must be used, or a premium of one or two cents per thousand must be paid. Therefore, banks took in more and issued less. Yesterday, they took in over 700,000 yuan and issued 400,000 to 500,000 yuan. As for silver and foreign exchange settlements by banks, foreign banks settled 5,230,000 yuan in silver and 5,890,000 yuan in foreign exchange, with 1,200,000 yuan in silver and 700,000 yuan in foreign exchange deposited. Chinese banks settled 3,230,000 yuan in notes, and various goods, remittances, taxes, pawn, special taxes, etc., totaled no less than 9,000,000 yuan, with 500,000 yuan deposited. Money shops and foreign public receipts settled over 41,000,000 yuan, and foreign silver dollar premiums settled over 6,500,000 yuan. Various remittance routes totaled over 700,000 yuan, customer sources totaled 200,000 yuan, outflows totaled over 400,000 yuan, and interbank lending transactions, morning market transfers, and transactions totaled over 5,700,000 yuan, with 600,000 yuan in the afternoon market, over 500,000 yuan in the small general warehouse, and 4,000,000 to 5,000,000 yuan in and out of the reserve depot.</p>
<p>Silver Dollars and Foreign Currency Fell, Copper Coins Continued to Rise</p>
<p>Jiangnan small foreign currency suddenly plummeted in the market yesterday. The morning market was 862 yuan, down 4.2 yuan from the previous day. The afternoon market fell another 3 yuan, calculated at 859 yuan. The Nanshi market even fell more than 7 yuan, which can be described as a wild fall. The transaction volume in the morning market was 6,500 corners, and in the afternoon market, it was 4,500 corners. Guangdong small foreign currency also continued to fall after rising, eventually falling back into the 800 yuan range. The morning market was 799.6 yuan, and the afternoon market was 799.3 yuan, resulting in a decrease of 2.7 yuan from the previous day. The transaction volume in the morning market was 75,000 corners, and in the afternoon market, it was 35,000 corners. Copper coins rose by 1,000 cash, to 308,500 cash.</p>
<p>New Sounds of Long-Term Consolidation</p>
<p>Ningbo Banks Send Representatives to Shanghai for Negotiations</p>
<p>The inflow and outflow of long-term (i.e., fixed-term deposits at banks) funds must undergo settlement or renewal, withdrawal, deposit, or lending every year in the first half (end of April) and the second half (end of October). There have always been sporadic transactions and settlement matters before the end of April and October. However, due to many incidents in recent years, the financial community has been cautious in lending. Therefore, although there are maturities, they are not as prosperous as in previous years. According to news from the industry yesterday, although there is demand in this street, silver and money businesses are reluctant to provide it. For maturing funds, they must be withdrawn, which shows the exhaustion of the market. Even the loans from Ningbo banks in Shanghai are not easy to recover this time. In the past few days, Ningbo banks have sent representatives to Shanghai for negotiations. We expect that most will be renewed upon maturity. It is impossible to recover them in this period. As for lending from Shanghai banks, it is even rarer. Perhaps there are a few transactions between old customers, which is unknown.</p>
<p>Essential Totals</p>
<p>The total exchange amount of the Shanghai Clearing House on April 19, 1933, was 4,162,951.39 yuan, including 2,464,204.86 yuan in silver dollars and 1,698,746.53 yuan in exchange of silver dollars.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Public Bonds Fall Sharply Under Environmental Pressure</p>
<p>Bulls Painfully Cut Losses, Speculators Short Selling</p>
<p>Afternoon Recovery, Slight Rebound</p>
<p>Yesterday, April 19th, the market sentiment at the Chinese Securities Exchange was particularly weak. As there are not many days left in this month, most bulls, under the pressure of this environment, had to seek a way out. Many were seen rolling over their positions or cutting losses painfully. In addition, speculators took advantage of the situation to push the market down and engaged in short selling. Market prices had a strong downward trend. In the first session of the morning, the far-term bonds of the Disbandment Loan plummeted by 1.4 yuan, and the rest also fell by more than 0.8 yuan. The second session opened later, and the market price of goods continued to fall. Therefore, when trading opened here, the Reorganization Loan suddenly fell by as much as 1 yuan, and the downward trend was quite drastic. Most of the retail bulls had withdrawn from the front line. The market opened in the afternoon, and it was already past 3 o'clock. Those covering short positions slightly took action, and the market rebounded by 0.2 to 0.3 yuan. The market closed because of news that there was nothing wrong in Tianjin and Beijing, and those covering short positions increased their efforts. Except for one or two types that still showed signs of wavering, most rebounded by 0.3 to 0.4 yuan. The Salt Tax Loan was particularly firm at the close, and the situation after the close was very good, and there may be a rebound within the day. The market price for the whole day fell by 0.7 to 0.8 yuan to more than 1 yuan. The far-term of the Whole Six Loan fell by 2 yuan, which was the market price after many days, and is not a standard. The total transaction volume was 14,193,000 yuan, including 3,000 yuan in spot goods. The futures of the Unified Salt Tax Loan accounted for 5,515,000 yuan, the Disbandment Loan accounted for 2,400,500 yuan, the 1929 Customs Loan accounted for 2,480,000 yuan, the 1920 20 Customs Loan accounted for 2,525,000 yuan, and the rest were several tens of thousands, ninety-odd thousands, and so on.</p>
<p>New York Stocks Remain Strong</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Tuesday (18th), the New York stock market had no ups and downs at first. Until the last hour, because President Roosevelt convened a meeting at the White House to discuss currency issues after the defeat of the inflationists in the Senate, and invited famous inflationist senators Burns and Thomas to attend, people's hearts were cheered, and stock goods rose to a peak. The US dollar was very weak, but because the government issued a note allowing gold to be shipped to France, people's hearts were still good. The Treasury Department has issued this note a total of five times. The Bankers Trust Company shipped a total of 3 million yuan of gold to France on this day, and Chase Bank also announced that it would ship out 3 million yuan on Friday. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 1,430,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>

<p>Yarn and Cotton Under Pressure from the Situation</p>
<p>The Decline of Marked Yarn and Cotton is Rampant</p>
<p>The yarn market was stable for two days, but now it has suddenly plummeted again. This is due to the deteriorating situation and the critical situation in North China. The sales of current yarn are sluggish, causing small bulls to panic. However, very few are selling in large quantities, which shows the weakness of the market. There is too much inventory and consumption is stagnant. In addition, inferior yarn is being dumped everywhere, and local yarn is greatly impacted.</p>
<p>Far-Term Yarn Plummets by 2.6 Yuan</p>
<p>When the Renbiao market opened in the morning, market sentiment was stable due to the rise in American cotton. However, there were few buyers in the market, and each month fell by 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.7, and 0.8 yuan. The market opened normally in the afternoon. In the second and third sessions, there was a sudden sharp drop. Rumors suddenly rose, market sentiment panicked, and the selling trend was strong. Each month fell by 1.8, 1.9, and 2.1 yuan. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 44,100 bales. It was found that Chunji sold 1,500 bales, Deji each 600 bales, Jifeng 1,200 bales, Xiesheng 1,250 bales, Dachang 1,050 bales, and Xincheng 800 bales. Changfeng bought 1,500 bales, Yichang 2,350 bales, Delong 1,000 bales, Dafeng 1,000 bales, and Huachang 1,050 bales. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Renbiao Closing Price Rise and Fall Inventory Number July 1870 Down 2.6 49,100</p>

<p>June 1850 2.6 47,650 Total 220,100</p>
<p>Current Yarn Consumption is Extremely Stagnant</p>
<p>The sales of current yarn are quite sluggish. It was found that all the gangs bought a total of only 551 bales throughout the day. The market fell by more than 1 yuan. The purchase amounts of each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 250 Jiangxi 20 Shantou 27</p>
<p>Colleagues 167 Xiamen 6 Inland 55</p>
<p>Fujian 5 Ningbo 21</p>
<p>The flower market is very weak, and the falling trend is gradually intensifying. Although foreign cotton has risen and the silver market has lengthened, there is a hidden decline. The factories have decided to implement a reduction in work starting on April 22nd. There is no intention to inquire about high-priced raw materials. As a result, the consumption of cotton in various production areas is lacking. There are many people coming to Shanghai to sell short, so the market is becoming more and more difficult to support. However, the large households have not yet settled the 100,000 dan they have absorbed, and the market situation is rising. However, the price difference between yarn and cotton is too far, how can the cotton market be high alone?</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Fell Again by 0.4 to 0.5 Yuan</p>
<p>When the Zheng Biao market opened in the morning, because American cotton rose, but gold prices tended to fall, a certain bull in this month offset the market, so the market sentiment was still firm, with each month up by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. In the afternoon, the market sentiment suddenly fell, and the situation was panic, with each month falling by 0.5 to 0.6 yuan. The total transaction volume for the whole day was 85,300 dan. It was found that Ruiyuan sold 6,100 dan, Yuande 2,300 dan, Xincheng 3,900 dan, Changfeng 1,800 dan, Renfeng 1,600 dan, Lichang 1,400 dan, and Tongxing 1,500 dan. Yuanda bought 6,300 dan, Suilong 4,100 dan, Chunji 2,000 dan, Yuanda 2,400 dan, and Yuchang 1,700 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>

<p>Current Cotton Mill's Intake is Almost Blocked</p>
<p>The current cotton business is still clear, and the intake of each factory is cut off. 50 bales of Yao flowers arrived in Shanghai,</p>
<p>Shandong American Seed Cotton 42.25 Yongan imported 500 pieces, delivered to the factory in three weeks.</p>
<p>Foreign Cotton Rose, British and Indian Fell</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton rose due to the activities of buyers, the strength of Wall Street, and rebound buying. The market was firm, with futures rising by 113 to 16 points and spot goods rising by 15 points. British cotton futures fell by 10 to 11 points, and spot goods fell by 1 point. Egyptian cotton spot goods fell by 4 points. The Indian cotton market was flat and tired, with Pingguoer falling by 2.5 rupees, Aomula falling by 1.5 rupees, and Bairuoxi falling by 2.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 18th):</p>

<p>Grain Lower River Rice Settled with a Soft Tone</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source was thirty to forty numbers. However, due to continuous rain, there were few customers in this street. Therefore, the early market showed fatigue, and although the later market showed a firm tone, the market situation was inevitably soft. Therefore, the seller tried to raise the price, but ultimately failed to reverse the decline, and the image of settling in with a soft tone was formed. The prices of Su Tong japonica and Nangang thick paddy were a few cents less. Nanyang and Shantou gangs continued to purchase a thousand bales, and the Beiyang and Yantai gangs purchased four to five hundred bales. However, the situation was not as tight as the previous day. The market price of Songjiang and other thin paddy from the Qingjiao gang was still standing firm. As for the goods from Xilian Tang, they were all retail purchases, and the price followed the fall by a few cents. Du Yangjian was stable, and Yinyuan was firm.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the source from various routes in the lower river was twenty-three to four numbers. Although it was raining continuously, the intake of white japonica was still not bad. The market shape was high and slightly tight. The early rice of thin japonica arrived and was sold well, and the price was also standing firm. Indica rice was settled, and Baiyuan was tight near the corner.</p>
<p>Saigon Rice Falls in Price and Sales Move</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation turned active. Because the small consignment returned from Hankou was sold at a low price, this street was quite interested. Another 100 bags were opened yesterday, and the price was still 7.35 yuan. The lenders of Saigon rice, in view of the cheap price and active sales of small consignments, also intended to be active, and then depreciated the high consignment of No. 1 Saigon, which was previously priced above 8 yuan, by a small corner. It has fallen by 0.2 yuan in two days, and is only sold at 7.8 yuan, which has attracted inquiries from rice shops in the north and south of the city and rural villages. A total of 3,000 bags were traded. Although the price was small, the market was active. The Min gang was also very keen to purchase guest indica, and the market price seemed to have the hope of climbing. However, the Hunan and Jiangxi guests, in view of the strong Min intake in Shanghai, telegraphed the area to ship the goods that were previously discussed. Therefore, although the vendors stopped loading, they ended up seeing the whole number arriving at the port. Yesterday, another 6,000 bags of Xiang and Jiangxi rice arrived in Shanghai. They were purchased by Min guests along with 550 bags of Xiangnan machine oil rice, priced at 8.32 to 8.28 yuan, and 540 bags of rough red rice, priced at 6.9 to 6.86 yuan. 1,000 bags of Jiangxi machine late rice were priced at 8.04 yuan, 7.7 yuan, and secondly at 7.37 yuan. 400 bags of Hunan machine red rice were priced at 7.86 yuan, all of which were purchased by the Min gang. This street is paying attention to foreign rice, it is said.</p>
<p>Marked Flour is Relatively Stable and Far-Reaching</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the flour market opened in the morning, each month showed a relatively stable and far-reaching image. Because the quotation of foreign wheat rose by 0.5 yuan and the Kan rose by about 0.1 yuan, the market sentiment of the far-term was quite stable after the opening. The buyers outside the industry were slightly active, which seemed to be better than the previous day by 0.5%. Because the attitude of the actual sales gang in this month was not good, it was still average. Until the market opened in the afternoon, this month generally hovered, and the ups and downs were very small. In the far-term months, due to the slightly higher inventory of small factories and changes in foreign exchange, people's hearts were loose again. According to the current situation, the actual sales in the north must be continuously mobilized, and the market will have a turnaround. In the far-term, foreign wheat must not be indiscriminately sold, in order to gain a foothold. Otherwise, the overall situation will be difficult to look good. As a result, this month was unchanged from the previous day, May was good at 0.05, June and July had no parity, August was small at 0.025, and September was small at 0.05, it is said.</p>
<p>Future Wheat is Generally Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, after the future wheat market opened in the morning and afternoon, each month generally showed a stable image. Because the quotation of foreign wheat rose by 0.1 yuan or 0.5 yuan, the market sentiment became stable. This month saw stability in the morning, and in the afternoon, due to the return of bulls, it went down a little by 0.02. Because the bottom of foreign wheat was very rich, it was not easy to hold on hard. The market sentiment in July and August turned stable due to the slightly lower inventory of shorts. However, the point of rising and falling depends on the source of foreign wheat. As a result, this month was small at 0.02, May and June did not move, July was good at 0.02, August was good at 0.04, and September was not opened.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat Sees Another Sharp Rise</p>
<p>On Tuesday (18th), Chicago wheat, due to inflation rumors, the public made speculative purchases, rising nearly 0.02. Also, the transaction volume on the previous day was 40 million bushels. The market is listed on the left:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>May 62.75 Up 1.875</p>
<p>July 64.125 Up 1.875</p>
<p>September 65.5 Up 1.875</p>
<p>Sugar Market Coarse Sand White Market Tired and Lower Again</p>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market, with the decline in marked gold, people's hearts were floating. Moreover, due to continuous rain, the transactions on various roads were quiet. Although No. 24 coarse sand was called down to 21.1 yuan, and No. 20 medium sand white was called 20.05 yuan, there were still no transactions. Taikoo sugar such as B mark 22.45 yuan, CW mark 22.3 yuan, although there was a slight allocation, the number was also sporadic. The domestic Zhiyang has recently been declining due to the continuous source. The market has fallen, and more than a hundred bags were opened yesterday and the previous day, and the price ranged from 18.8 yuan to 0.5 yuan, which was more than 0.5 to 0.6 yuan lower than before. Mianhu red was also weak and faded due to the arrival of more goods. However, powdered white sugar such as double-covered opened at 19.5 yuan, and single-covered opened at 19 yuan. Because the source was limited, the receivers were still active.</p>
<p>Silk Tea Artificial Silk Customer Sales Continue to be Smooth</p>
<p>In recent days, the foreign exchange rate has shrunk, and the price of artificial silk has become more firm. The silk factories in Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Suzhou continue to demand artificial silk in the near and far term. Yesterday morning, the Hangzhou, Shaoxing, and Su gangs threw 52 boxes of Hongque, Lanque, Jinzhong, Lujinyu, Shuangxing and other brands for April, May, and June at the guild, and the price ranged from 164.5 to 178.25 yuan net, it is said.</p>
<p>Hardware Enamel Factory Searches for Black Iron Sheet</p>
<p>Due to the weather conditions, very few people in the industry have purchased black iron sheets, so the current imports are also a drop in the bucket. The enamel factory was affected by the filling of inventory, and there were very few buyers, so there is a shortage of goods at the moment. Therefore, there are many people who are searching for them. There are not many spot goods in this port market yesterday, and the standard is optimistic. For example, thick colored flowers are estimated at 12 yuan, which is 0.45 yuan higher than before. Thin colored flowers are sold at 14.87 yuan, which is also 0.027 yuan better than before.</p>
<p>Tinplate Follows the Rise in the Tin Market</p>
<p>In recent days, the tin market has been rising frequently, which has caused the price of tinplate to rise by several cents to 2 shillings. For example, the price of British goods from the company is 16 pounds and 11 shillings, 90 pounds is 18 shillings, and 100 pounds is 19 shillings and 2 cents. However, the industry in this port has no orders because the price is too high, it is said.</p>

<h3>China's Constipation Medicine's Global Activities</h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Recommendations from British and Japanese Government Pharmacopoeias</p>
<p>Welcome Adoption by European and American University Hospitals</p>
<p>Pharmacological Explanation</p>
<p>Free Upon Request</p>
<p>The main ingredient of "Tiantian Tong" pills is domestic rhubarb. According to rhubarb's nature, it is rapid, promoting the old and bringing forth the new, like suppressing chaos to achieve peace. Therefore, it has the title of "General." Shennong's Materia Medica has recognized it as a good medicine for constipation. Emperor Xuanzong of Jin boiled rhubarb into a paste and made it into pills, which had miraculous effects when taken. He ordered it to be named "Baoan Wan." This is constipation and hemorrhoids, a reliable medicine that has been repeatedly tested and proven by hundreds of thousands of doctors in China for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Tiantian Tong</p>
<p>Radical Cure Panacea</p>
<p>Therefore, the importance of rhubarb in Chinese medicine is almost the same as that of ginseng. Because there is a comment that "ginseng is a good minister for governing the world, and rhubarb is a good general for stabilizing the world." Therefore, the reputation of Chinese rhubarb has spread at home and abroad. Since the opening of the sea ban, it has been exported from Shanghai to European and American countries. The Western medical community sees that rhubarb has both the miraculous functions of strengthening the stomach and slowing down the bowels, which is better than any Western medicine. Therefore, they are competing to study the transplant of rhubarb, hoping to transform it into a special product of their respective countries. However, the rhubarb transplanted by European and American countries and Japan has a world of difference in terms of appearance, color, fragrance, and efficacy compared with Chinese rhubarb due to the differences in geology and climate. Therefore, the current Japanese government pharmacopoeia contains the praise that "Chinese rhubarb is the most ideal constipation medicine compared with any domestic product." British rhubarb products are generally coated with Chinese rhubarb powder to decorate the surface and sold in European and American markets. From this point of view, the honorable position of Chinese rhubarb in the world can be imagined. Our factory applies scientific methods to extract the essence of domestic rhubarb to make the main ingredient of this preparation. Its nature is peaceful, and there are no side effects. For habitual constipation, even if it is used continuously, it can have the same effect. Moreover, those who suffer from hemorrhoids take it, and the stool is very soft and does not oppress the affected area. Therefore, it helps to promote the wonderful function of natural healing. Foguang Brand Scientific National Medicine Tiantian Tong is priced at four corners per tube (ten days of service).</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Resisting Mental Enemies</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The bad news that the enemy has invaded deeply into the customs in three routes has been unfortunately confirmed one by one! The declarations of important people always say: "Victory is not enough to be happy about, and defeat is not enough to be worried about." Now that the national affairs are in such a bad state, of course, it is another "defeat is not enough to be worried about."</p>
<p>I say: It is true that defeat is not enough to be worried about. The enemy will invade deeply, and the enemy will also flee far away. As long as the people strive for success, they can always drive the enemy out of the country. However, the Japanese enemy is not enough to be feared, and the mental enemy is greatly to be worried about! The Japanese enemy invades deeply, and the enemy can be driven out of the country; the mental enemy invades deeply, but the enemy cannot be driven out of the country. Moreover, the enemy comes in three routes, six routes, nine routes, and even infinite routes, which is even more turbulent and unstoppable than the Japanese invading Qinhuangdao, occupying Beidaihe, and breaking Xifengkou. Alas! The enemy is deep! What to do?</p>
<p>The mental enemy is so rampant that it specializes in seizing gaps and attacking people's minds. Invading the garden of officials, it will absorb the people's wealth and deposit it in foreign banks. Invading the garden of soldiers, it will use a fierce face to deal with merchants and civilians, and use the attitude of three retreats and three concessions to deal with the Japanese army and puppet army. Invading the garden of merchants, it will use secret means to traffic in enemy goods, and on the surface, it only says that the heart of patriotism does not dare to lag behind others. Invading the garden of male and female students, it will be intoxicated in cinemas and dance halls, and there is a tendency not to ask about national disasters but to ask about modernity. There are also other mental enemies that destroy personality, specializing in attacking the gardens of those with weak wills, recognizing thieves as fathers, leading wolves into the house, and acting as accomplices to tigers. Alas! I can't bear to say it.</p>
<p>If the mental enemy is not eliminated, the patriotic front will be in jeopardy. To save this serious national crisis, it is necessary to build strict barriers in everyone's mind and jointly resist the mental enemy that invades in three routes, six routes, nine routes, and even infinite routes. Once the mental enemy is eliminated, then the Japanese enemy will retreat without being driven out.</p>
<h3>Key</h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>What is the most precious and dearest thing to a person besides their own life?  Wife?  A wife might turn against you, might divorce you: so she can't be considered the most precious and dearest thing.  Children?  In this world, only parents cherish and love their children: children towards their parents don't necessarily all know how to be filial and loving; so those who think it through also deny that children are the most precious and dearest things.  Speaking of our country, there are governments, officials, and soldiers to handle internal and external affairs. What does the country's joys and sorrows, honor and disgrace, have to do with us common folk?  Those officials and soldiers still don't take responsibility for lost territory and national humiliation, let alone us common folk; so the country can't be considered our most precious and dearest thing either!  You must know that the most precious and dearest treasure people have is nothing else, but that personal treasure that never leaves their side, resting high up in the rich man's crotch!  The key.</p>
<p>This is what I only came to understand in my "unconfused" year.  Originally, I was a teacher for over twenty years, and I never knew how to be secretive when speaking to people.  A worn-out brush and a few tattered books didn't need to be stored in a golden cabinet or stone chamber, so of course I didn't have a key on me.  Now I'm just loafing around in a government office, and I'm realizing through seeing and hearing that there's no end to learning, you can learn until you're old!  Speaking to people should be like the secret scriptures in the Dunhuang stone chamber, making people feel endlessly mysterious!  A key should be hidden in one's own belly, making it difficult for people to open, only then can one be seen as being profound and mysterious in how they conduct themselves!</p>
<p>In reality, the key is a priceless treasure.  Because we've never mingled in financial institutions, our pockets are empty, free from worries, and we don't have to worry about our hands being raided.  Things like bank and money shop passbooks, as well as all sorts of colorful banknotes, shiny silver coins, and also deeds, loan receipts, government bonds, treasury bills, account books, jewelry, precious items...aren't all these things kept in silver boxes?  Who gets to open these silver boxes besides the rich person themselves?  Opening a silver box requires a key, so we often see rich people rummaging around in their crotches. In the near future, the key to this silver box will have to work. The more frequent the rich man's money goes in and out, the busier the key's job becomes, and the rummaging in the crotch has no time to stop.  Looking from the sidelines with a cold eye, this little key is really the rich man's most precious and dearest thing.</p>
<h3>The Bund at Dawn</h3>
<p>— Ke Ding'an</p>
<p>This is probably a bad habit that doesn't fit the people of Shanghai: because once it gets to 10 o'clock at night, no matter what, I always have to go to the land of dreams to seek happiness; and once the sky brightens in the morning, I have to get up.  I know that this habit of mine doesn't fit in with modern people, but on the one hand, it has unspeakable benefits for my own body, so maybe this bad habit can be sympathized with and praised by the general public.</p>
<p>The climate of late spring is peculiar this year, still so cold. When I get up in the morning, the thermometer in the room is always at 40 degrees.  Although I'm not afraid of the cold, I can see the shape of the breath I exhale every morning, knowing that the cold air is still filling the world.</p>
<p>That day, it was comparatively warmer.  As usual, I got up, and after hearing the grand sound of the customs clock striking six times, I walked alone to the Huangpu River to appreciate the unusual scenery of the morning.</p>
<p>I went to play at the Bronze Statue Pier first.  A group of Japanese children, probably brought over from Pudong by small steamboats, with their schoolbags hanging on their backs, jumping and skipping as they came up. At the same time, the Chinese mechanic who controlled the small steamboat triumphantly opened it and left.  People waiting for the ferry hurriedly walked onto the ferry. A pregnant woman about to give birth, carrying a large package on her back, holding a five-pound jar in her hand, and also leading a five- or six-year-old boy who was biting on a fried dough stick, walked very staggeringly onto the boat. At the same time, a young man who looked like a worker didn't come to help the woman, but instead put on a slippery expression and laughed at the woman on the boat.</p>
<p>Large sailboats, small sailboats, naked boats! It was a light boat, some people called it a naked boat. Sampan boats, steamboats:::, etc., are very artistically dotted in the Huangpu River, moving with great affection.</p>
<p>I often praise the general coolies as the most sacred people in the world. Think about it, Shanghai is indeed a prosperous city, but without the creation of the general coolies, I think it will never be able to become a prosperous city! At a pier near the Bund Park, the most sacred coolies had already started working. In the shouts of "Hang Yu! Hang Yu!", the highest and supreme tone responded, surpassing the rhythm of the complicated commands tenfold, and even the pearly throat of a young girl could not match its sublimity!</p>
<p>When I came back, the golden top of the towering Sassoon House was already shining into my eyes from the sun.</p>

<p>He looked at Guizhi and asked, "How much do you want to write?" Guizhi said, "Write three taels of silver for me." The shop assistant rolled up the bedding and pushed it out, saying, "Girl, take it. Three taels of silver is a lot of money; you can make a living with it." Guizhi said, "Don't you know I need money for New Year's Eve?" Write a little less if you have to. The shop assistant said, "We're just helping out on New Year's Eve. I'll write one tael and two qian for you." Guizhi said, "One tael and two qian isn't even two dollars! You have to write two taels and four qian." The shop assistant said, "That's impossible." As he spoke, he attended to other customers. Guizhi refused to leave and called after him, "Shopkeeper, shopkeeper! You said you were helping out; can you write two qian less?" The shop assistant said, "This kind of thing isn't worth much. Giving you one tael and two qian is already doing you a favor." This sentence angered Guizhi. Her face turned red, and she said, "What do you mean, doing me a favor? I'm pawning something for your money; I'm not asking you to give it away for free. You make people pay three fen of interest per month. How did you pawnshops get rich? Isn't it all money squeezed from us poor people? If it weren't New Year's Eve, I'd give you a piece of my mind!" Her voice was very loud, attracting an old shop assistant with a beard. He waved his hand at her and said, "Girl, let's talk it over; don't shout. You say we make three fen of interest, but do you know that the money we borrow from the bank is also one fen, four or five li? After deducting expenses and losses, what money can we make? This is just a business of convenience for both parties." As he spoke, he opened the bedding again, looked at the clothes, and laughed, "Alright, I'll write two taels for you; I really can't give you any more." Guizhi felt that the money was still not enough to pay off her debts and was about to argue when someone suddenly called out "Old girl" from behind. This call was well-timed and planted the seeds for many future events.</p>
<p>(Note: In the northern custom, during the Lunar New Year, one must offer a kind of honey offering to heaven, earth, ancestors. This item is made by frying noodles in oil, coating them with honey, and forming a pagoda shape. It is offered on New Year's Eve and removed on the Lantern Festival. Poor people cannot afford to buy this, so they give money to the cake shop or baker every month from spring and summer. By the end of the year, the amount is just right, and they can get it, which is called "making a honey offering." (See the 15th of this month) (47)</p>
<h3>Business Secrets</h3>
<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>One day, I went to a restaurant in front of the Chenghuang Temple to drink, and I met a vegetarian restaurant owner. While chatting over drinks, we naturally talked about business. I asked the owner, "How's business lately?" He replied, "Business is still good. However, business requires people to do it. There is a big difference between knowing how to do business and not knowing how to do business. When it comes to doing business, the source of goods is very important. This is not only true for our industry. For example, dried mushrooms in vegetarian food are in the greatest demand. Domestic goods sell for 150-160 taels of silver per load, while Dongyang goods (i.e., Japanese goods) only sell for 70 taels of silver per load, and the goods are better and the flesh is thicker. If we use Dongyang goods, we sell stir-fried dried mushrooms for eight jiao per plate. The profit is very high, and it pleases the customers, who eat with relish. On the other hand, if we use local dried mushrooms, there is no profit to be made, and we may even lose money, and the customers will grumble and complain about the taste. So, shopkeepers have no choice but to go for 'cheap and good quality,' which is also a helpless thing. When going to the market to purchase goods, you have to keep your eyes open, look at the goods, and don't ask if they are Dongyang goods or not. Just have a tacit understanding with each other. In short, people who do business are all about seeking profit and making money, and they don't talk about loving the country or not. If you want to love the country, it is difficult to make money. If you want to make money, it is difficult to love the country. The two cannot be taken care of at the same time. If you have money but don't want to earn it, and you shout about loving the country while watching others make money, isn't that being foolish? Look at the big bosses who have been building foreign houses, riding in cars, and taking concubines in recent years. If you ask them how they make money, most of them make their fortunes by selling Dongyang goods!" After hearing what he said, I sighed and said, "Alas! The secret to doing business is like this. Only those who truly love the country are fools. Those who want to make a fortune are all smart people. It's a pity that there are too many smart people, which is why the country has been brought to this state!"</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Talk</p>
<h3>Random Notes on Returning Home</h3>
<p>— Tian Qi</p>
<p>My hometown is in Shaoxing City. Shaoxing City, it is said, was built by Fan Li, a doctor of the Yue Kingdom during the Wu-Yue period. Therefore, Shaoxing City is also known as "Yue City" and "Li City." Although this "city" has some historical value, it is, after all, old and outdated, becoming a laggard of the times. Compared with Shanghai, the magnificent, prosperous, and rich first metropolis of the East, it naturally shows the difference between "civilized" and "uncivilized." So, when I return to Shaoxing, my friends usually say that I have returned to the "countryside." Hometown is, after all, hometown. If Shanghai people regard it as the "countryside," who can say it is not appropriate? Although the newspapers use very large special characters to publish things like danger and loss, Shanghai is still full of songs and dances, a scene of prosperity and peace. Shaoxing is even further away from such things, so naturally it is a paradise, "not knowing there was Han, let alone Wei and Jin!"</p>
<p>I went to the real countryside (the countryside of Shaoxing) for a few days and saw the golden rapeseed flowers and the green wheat seedlings, everywhere full of "vitality." Therefore, I thought of the "Vitality" film produced by the company. I don't know if it has been completed yet? Because when I left, "Vitality" only needed one or two more scenes to be completed, and a part of the work after the film was completed had to wait for me to do.</p>
<p>I talked to several relatives and friends I hadn't seen for a long time. In the conversation, I got some recordable information:</p>
<p>Mr. A said: "There is a Mr. Gao in Hangzhou who took 20,000 yuan from his property and deposited it in the bank, stipulating that during his lifetime, he would only move the interest and not the principal. After his death, even the interest would not be moved. After 80 years, the principal and interest would be used for local public welfare. He also filed a record with the official government to prevent his descendants or local unscrupulous people from using it by borrowing. If it reaches 80 years later, that would be amazing. According to the ordinary interest rate, after seven years, there will be double the interest. For example, if you deposit 20,000 yuan, after seven years, the principal and interest will be a total of 40,000 yuan. Accumulating in this way, 20,000 yuan of deposits, after 77 years, including principal and interest, has reached 40.96 million yuan. Now the fixed term is 80 years, then the total principal and interest will be at least more than 50 million yuan. With such a huge amount of money, it is not only more than enough to hold local public welfare, but also to buy airplanes and build warships, there is also considerable effect."</p>
<p>I said: "This method is really good. Now the method of saving the country focuses on the "long term," such as "long-term resistance." My idea is that patriotic rich people may as well imitate Mr. Gao's method to make a "long-term savings to save the country." Although the time limit is longer, the unexpected effect is on this "long term"!"</p>
<p>Mr. B said: "I now have four sons and one daughter, it's really too sinful!"</p>
<p>"What are you talking about?" I asked in surprise.</p>
<p>"In this difficult year, I gave birth to them, only to make them suffer in this world!" Mr. B studies Buddhism, and this remark is quite philosophical.</p>
<p>"This is because you and your wife's love is too strong!" I laughed.</p>
<p>"I live in the school every day and rarely go home," Mr. B defended. "This is called having few desires and many sons!"</p>
<p>"::::::"</p>
<p>Mr. C said: "There are two lecturers in the People's Education Center who go to various villages every month to give lectures. Although there are few listeners, they are not as attractive as the little peddler who sells pear syrup candy. Sometimes, they are even ridiculed and questioned by the villagers. However, for the sake of eating, the lecturers have no choice but to set out as usual and give lectures as usual. Later, the education authorities, I don't know whether it was because these lectures were meaningless or to save money, actually cut these lecturers, but the lecture drafts still had to be written monthly and sent to the Education Department for review, because the lecture drafts must be approved by the Education Department before they can be lectured. Now that the lecturers have been cut, the lecture drafts are still sent for review. This kind of article is too meaningless!"</p>
<p>I said: "This is called empty talk on paper!"</p>
<p>A week's vacation passed in the blink of an eye. Although I don't hate my hometown, I don't have any nostalgia for it. So, in the heavy spring rain, I came to Shanghai again.</p>

<h3>Advertisement Summary</h3>
<p>— Da Wu</p>
<p>Reading the newspaper without reading the advertisements is like eating crab without eating crab legs. Many wonderful articles that cannot be seen in the news, in the commentary, or on the back page of the newspaper are often found in the advertisements. Here is an excerpt as an example, which is a song and dance advertisement of a certain cinema:</p>
<p>"Since the song and dance troupe came into being, only the Song and Dance Troupe can become famous, because the highlights of the troupe's performers are: the quivering of fat hips, the endless changes, can melt the soul of Liu Hui, the slight presentation of curves, has enough to intoxicate the spirit of Lu Nan, watching its body, makes people dizzy and dizzy, the mind dissipates and disappears, near its side, then the musk orchids are fragrant, making people weak and soft: there is an infinite new wonder exotic enchanting mysterious instinct exists in it."</p>
<p>Needless to say, this is of course a soul-stirring article, and without actually watching the songs and dances, it has already made people soft. By the way, check all the movie advertisements that day, among which eight are adding erotic songs and dances that sacrifice beauty with pink legs and soft breasts, and one is performing "newly emerging revolutionary art" songs and dances. From these advertisements, I will "reluctantly" copy two more examples:</p>
<p>"Rich songs and greasy dances, modern, artistic, unprecedented, tempting, have their own true value, no need to boast. The crowd of females are as beautiful as jade, naked and singing, naked and dancing, naked and teasing people's youth, the wonderful music is like fairy music, stirring the soul, melting the spirit, moving the heart, intoxicating the mind."</p>
<p>"At the same time, we have hired a foreign women's song and dance troupe to perform special nude erotic dances on stage, which are beautiful and artistic, reaching the extreme. Not only is art public, but also sacrifices beauty. Children under the age of sixteen are not admitted."</p>
<p>Among the eight theaters with song and dance performances, the song and dance troupes of seven of them are blue-eyed women from foreign countries, and one is the "Funny Masters Group," which is a domestic product. And it is also "pink legs and soft breasts, the curves are fully presented." If you check again, the films screened in these theaters are all imported films, and they are all films of knights, thieves, lust, beasts, and terror. From this small and small statistics, I suddenly realized to what extent the collapse and weakness of the art of this old world has reached, to the point that it has to use the flesh to turn the tide. We only need to look at the recent few domestic films that have been liberated from the gods and monsters and martial arts films, and the popularity of the films can make us understand the trend of the citizens' psychology. This is a strong counter-evidence, and moreover, the consciousness represented by the citizens is not the front line.</p>
<p>As for these splendid articles of advertisements, it really leaves people speechless, so I might as well cut out some more things and paste them below:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, after reading the newspaper here, please piously recite Namo Amitabha Buddha, either a thousand times, or a hundred times, or ten times, you will get ten kinds of merits in this life."</p>
<h3>Practical Writing Talk</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>It is said that since the popularization of vernacular Chinese, the clerks who handle documents are about to become extinct; now there are still a few "Lu Lingguang Temple" style old men supporting the scene, but the Lu Lingguang Temple is about to fall, so isn't there a danger of extinction?</p>
<p>Among the good stories of the document clerks, there are a few leading figures: Rao Hanxiang, who made parallel telegrams for Li Yuanhong in the early years of the Republic of China, and Fan Zengxiang, who made a guilty edict for the emperor in the Guangxu years, both made some antique, emotional and literary "Dian Mo Xun Gao", which was greatly admired by the clerks. The best trick of the document masters is said to open up the world from the folder, and the secret is learned from the eight-legged essay; it is not official, but it is said to be very dignified; it is clearly shameless, but it is shouted very loudly. In the early Qing Dynasty, everyone kowtowed in front of the foreign race, and they couldn't help but feel ashamed; the document clerk shook his pen and said, "He who kills my lord is my enemy, and he who kills my enemy is my lord." Just kowtow, and the heart is calm. In the Jiazi War, Lu Yongxiang was defeated and decided to retire and go abroad. His face was inevitably dull: the document clerk shook his pen and said, "Loving the country, I dare not lag behind others, and success is not necessarily me!" Please ask the general to end the scene in a dignified manner. When the master is worried, the slave can think of ways to share his worries. The reason why the document clerk cannot be allowed to become extinct is very clear.</p>
<p>Let's put aside the fact that document clerks are good at making wonderful articles in folders, and just talk about another famous hand who is good at making two wonderful articles. This person is a great man, he is the "head" of a certain organization, so he started to make two articles: first divide the existing forces into two, and let them compete against each other. "A" and "B" fight, see who wins and who loses. If B fails, he will use A. At the same time, cultivate another "C" force to form two. "A" and "C" fight, if "A" fails, he will use "C", and then establish and cultivate another "D" force to form two. Write these two two good articles, and he is high above. Empress Dowager Cixi, Yuan Shikai, and Xu Shichang are all famous in the world for being good at writing this kind of article. However, being high above can also often play the wishful thinking. Sometimes, when the two articles are being written happily, suddenly the head turns him around, abruptly interrupts, and can't continue. He has to make a grimace and end the scene; such as Xu Shichang's life is smooth, it is inevitable to touch a nose of ash, that is, the reason why the head turned around. In the past hundred years, only the "head" of the "head" has never escaped, and it is called "imperialism." He is the first famous hand of the eight-legged essay. He first wrote two articles on the topic of "China": the first one, helping the Qing court to eliminate the revolutionary forces; the second one, helping the revolutionary party to overthrow the Qing court. After the success of the Xinhai Revolution, two more articles came: the first one: helping Yuan Shikai to eliminate the Kuomintang; the second one, helping the Kuomintang to overthrow Yuan Shikai. Yuan Shikai went to heaven, and two more articles came: the first one, helping the Beiyang warlords to eliminate the Kuomintang; the second one, helping the Kuomintang to overthrow the Beiyang warlords. There are also many wonderful articles in the middle, which are also made into two two: helping Zhi topple Wan, helping Wan topple Zhi: helping Feng topple Zhi, helping Zhi topple Feng. Only in the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, when the National Revolution reached Hankou, seeing that the two wonderful articles were about to escape, he was so anxious; fortunately, he put them together quickly, and put together two more. Judging from the current situation, this kind of two articles, he can't finish writing for a while!</p>
<p>Or say: "We must first resist foreign aggression before we can pacify the country" and "We must first pacify the country before we can resist foreign aggression", aren't they two excellent articles? The answer is: our "head" can only write one; only the "head of the head" can write two. Do you want "then"? See if you can "must first"! Do you want "must first"? See how you "after"? The left and right bows are just right, it is really the only wonderful article in the world, even Rao Hanxiang and Fan Zengxiang have to admire endlessly. Zhao Pu of the Song Dynasty used half of the Analects to rule the world, and the "head" of the "head" used two articles to "Luan" (Zhu's note: Luan, governing) the world, this is called "text" of "application".</p>
<h3>The Road to the Rejuvenation of the Chinese Nation</h3>
<p>— Cheng Yunping</p>
<p>It is an undeniable fact that Chinese politics is not on the right track. The root cause has been investigated by people who have gone to Europe for investigation.</p>
<p>First, it is said that China today is not a matter of system, but a matter of people. That is to say, as long as a hero comes out, (such as Mussolini, Hitler, etc., are annotated by Ping) China can be rejuvenated. Dictatorship is of course good, and monarchy is also good, even if the system itself has toxic qualities, the system itself has disgusting elements, it is not a problem at all. When the saint comes out, the water of the Yellow River will naturally be clear. Second, does China have such a hero today? It is said that there are heroes, but the Chinese people do not unanimously support them and cannot be obedient people. Once something happens, they express their opinions and argue endlessly. (Such as non-resistance, direct negotiation, they talk too much and make a lot of noise, Ping noted) making it difficult for heroes to do things.</p>
<p>Third, the biggest problem with the Chinese people is that they can only write articles and talk empty words, and they cannot actually implement them. This understanding is naturally also absolutely true. For example, since the outbreak of the national crisis, we have really read a lot of the glorious proclamations of those in power; but, where are the facts of "swearing to resist the enemy to the death" and "recovering lost land"? As for the poor and humble people below, they are just talking empty words about saving the country. For example, donating money to buy airplanes is too unenthusiastic. So far, the airplanes that have been bought are far less than the number that Zhang Shaoshuai was robbed by Japan that time. This is of course "deserving of ten thousand deaths"!</p>
<p>In short, the road to the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation should be: implement a dictatorship, invite "heroes" to the stage, the common people unanimously support them, and prohibit noise. At the same time, everyone should take out their wallets to save the country. Even if there is no wallet to take out, selling children and selling women is definitely "justifiable."</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes from Home</h3>
<p>— Mu Shiying</p>
<p>The City of Fish and Salt</p>
<p>Ningbo is truly a city of fish and salt. The moment you step onto the street, you hear cries of "Yellow croaker for sale!" We walked down a street that could truly be called Salted Fish Street. The entire street was lined with salted fish businesses, their doorways filled with bamboo baskets. Inside the baskets were flat, dead fish with dull eyes, piled up as if devoid of all feeling. The air was permeated with that—oh, so intimate and lovely—odor. I felt that even the sunlight in this city had a salty taste; it was a strong, fiery yellow sunlight, unlike the faint, yawning, stretching sunlight of Shanghai.</p>
<p>Everything in this small trading port struck us as novel and somewhat unreasonable. The shops along the street, the advertisements, the way carriages and horses moved, the walking habits—all were different from Shanghai. One large, bargain-priced advertisement read: "Our shop has always adhered to a non-resistance, big bargain-price principle. Any customer who attacks any goods in our shop will be met with a bargain price!" The people of Ningbo are truly humorous. The way pedestrians walked on the street almost made me laugh. Those going forward didn't necessarily walk on the left, and those coming this way didn't necessarily walk on the right. Everyone weaved east and west, bumping into each other randomly, muttering "heh-heh" in their mouths. I was bumped into by five people on one street. It was truly laughable. Once, as I was walking forward, someone came towards me, muttering "heh-heh," as if telling me to move aside. I edged a little inward, and he abruptly swerved, bumping into me. Another time, someone was coming toward me, I was on the outside, he was on the inside—there was no way we could bump into each other. But as we approached, he suddenly swerved and bumped into me. He bumped into me, still muttering "heh-heh," and strode across the street with a blank expression. He bumped into me just because he wanted to cross the street! I almost doubled over with laughter.</p>
<p>Walking on the street for less than an hour, the three of us really made our stomachs ache from laughing. The rickshaw pullers here have a different flair than in Shanghai. They love to strut proudly through the crowds, without uttering a word to make way or even a greeting. The three of us were walking abreast when a rickshaw suddenly flew up from behind, silently splitting us apart and forcing its way through. The cold demeanor of those riding in the rickshaws was also interestingly intense: sitting up high, using their thumbs and forefingers to forcefully cram cigarettes into their mouths, heads tilted back a bit, lips slightly pouting, yet still wearing a carefree, extremely pleased expression, secretly tapping the bell underfoot, ringing it loudly and unsettlingly.</p>
<p>Another thing that surprised us about this city was that we didn't see a single beggar. The fish-and-salt-eating residents of this city all seemed to have a stubborn face that disdained bowing or bending.</p>
<p>Ningbo is truly a peculiar and flavorful city.</p>

<h3>The Crossroads of the Times and Love</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Don't cry, your daddy is back."</p>
<p>Qiu Ying said, then giggled. Haiquan knew she was deliberately joking like that.</p>
<p>"It's me, not Old Cao."</p>
<p>Haiquan hurriedly clarified. As he spoke, he took off his hat and walked into the room. It was probably late at night; the electric light in the room seemed particularly bright. He saw Qiu Ying's cheeks, as if she had been drinking, red and shiny, reflecting the light. He thought she was especially beautiful tonight.</p>
<p>"Just call Mr. Lin 'Daddy' then."</p>
<p>Because the child wouldn't sleep, she picked him up again. As she spoke, she walked towards Haiquan. Haiquan wasn't as flustered as he had been earlier in the day. He extended an arm and placed it around Qiu Ying's shoulders. The two kissed again.</p>
<p>"Hasn't Old Cao returned yet?"</p>
<p>"Christmas is almost here; the church must be busy. Don't worry about him. Who knows when he'll be back? We'll sleep our own sleep.::"</p>
<p>":::::::"</p>
<p>Haiquan didn't understand what she meant and didn't respond for a long time.</p>
<p>"Wait for me to set up the cot for you. Uncle Lin, you hold him.:::"</p>
<p>At that moment, she intimately changed her address to "Uncle Lin," and he completely forgot the loneliness and sorrow of two or three hours ago.</p>
<p>"No. Let's wait until Old Cao returns. Otherwise, we'll have to sit facing each other until dawn."</p>
<p>"In that case, you can sit and wait for him. When the time comes, I absolutely have to sleep.:::"</p>
<p>The two chatted and laughed for another hour or so. It was almost twelve o'clock, the child had fallen asleep, and she was half-sitting, half-lying, dozing against the headboard. Haiquan thought, *this is awkward*, not knowing whether to sleep or not. When he felt a wave of temptation he had never experienced before, a chill ran through his entire body, and he lost all courage again.</p>
<p>She turned over and started taking off her outer clothing.</p>
<p>"Mr. Lin, I'm going to sleep. Aren't you going to sleep?"</p>
<p>She was only wearing her pajamas. She went to the door and bolted it.</p>
<p>"Old Cao hasn't returned yet."</p>
<p>"When he comes back, we'll open it."</p>
<p>She rubbed her eyes, climbed into bed, and burrowed under the covers.</p>
<p>"Then I'll go take a walk outside."</p>
<p>"Go where?"</p>

<h3>Is it Setting a Trend or Sounding a Warning?</h3>
<p>— Xiang Ding</p>
<p>I really don't understand what kind of extraordinary person Lu Genrong is, or what kind of glorious deeds he has done, that he would warrant the cinema owner's "lavish invitation," recklessly publishing an advertisement in the newspaper with type larger than that used for the fall of Lengkou? And even more incomprehensible is that it actually made tens of thousands of ladies and gentlemen scramble to "behold his countenance"! Lu Genrong is, after all, a lucky man. First, he had the favor of Miss Huang, and after some lawsuits, he finally received a "lavish invitation" from a large cinema owner, and even more ladies and gentlemen were willing to show their faces and come to "appreciate" him. If Miss Huang knew about this in the underworld (though she probably isn't there), she could rest in peace without resentment.</p>
<p>Tang Yulin has been terribly unlucky ever since he abandoned Chengde. In addition to being investigated by the government and scolded by the people, he is now being trampled on by a servant like Lu Genrong. The so-called "Lu Genrong Captures Tang Yulin Alive" has become Lu Genrong's "immortal work" and also the "way to make money" for a certain cinema, but General Tang has "lost face" to the extreme. Tang Yulin's being trampled on is certainly his own fault, but what kind of person is Lu Genrong anyway?</p>
<p>I really admire the "thorough consideration" of that cinema owner. Fearing that a completely authentic, genuine Lu Genrong, and a newly created 1933 play, "Lu Genrong Captures Tang Yulin Alive," would not be enough to "attract a wide audience," they added a "headlining act," which the audience also considered a "brilliant performance," namely inviting the person himself (i.e., Lu Genrong himself) to report on the crime he committed and his time in jail.</p>
<p>My knowledge is shallow, and in my life, I have only heard of inviting some expert to "report on the results of their investigation in a certain country," or a general representing Shanghai to "report on the progress of the war of resistance against Japan." As for inviting someone who has been in court for adultery to "report on the crime and jail time," I am ashamed to admit that I have never heard of it before.</p>
<p>People blinded by foreign money are only thinking about how to increase their own business income, so they don't hesitate to invite someone like Lu Genrong to "tell his story in person" in public. They can ignore everything else.</p>
<p>In fact, strictly speaking, Lu Genrong's "report on the crime he committed" alone is not enough to fully attract the audience. For the sake of that cinema owner, it would be best to hire a prostitute or "wild chicken" from Baxianqiao and have her publicly "report on the process of XX" on stage. If the news spread, perhaps "people from all directions would come." At that time, I dare say, we would definitely "have a bustling crowd" to the point of putting up a "sold out" sign.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I would like to say to all servants listening: I hope you quickly work hard to seduce the daughters of your masters. The result may be that you will also be "lavishly invited" by cinemas!</p>

<h3>Lament for Lengkou</h3>
<p>— Qian Mengshao</p>
<p>To the right stands Jieling, to the left Xifeng,</p>
<p>A dark city stretches in the midst of the sky.</p>
<p>Luan East's lock, Lengkou, is fiercely contested.</p>
<p>The bandit pours in, armored, surrounding and attacking.</p>
<p>Nine attacks, nine rejections, lost to the Di,</p>
<p>At dusk, lightning snakes around, striking.</p>
<p>A killing aura, birds dare not stop,</p>
<p>The Great Wall for ten thousand miles runs away to avoid it.</p>
<p>Ten thousand black clouds fall in Yandu,</p>
<p>Swallowing bandit air, seizing mountains and peaks,</p>
<p>Chopping through formations, drawing swords, standing to devour each other,</p>
<p>Such a valiant army is unmatched in the world.</p>
<p>Dark and yellow dragons battle, bloodying the wilderness,</p>
<p>For ten days, Kunyang, flying roofs and tiles,</p>
<p>One morning, the bandit army steps on backs,</p>
<p>A sigh envelops the East, ten thousand horses flee.</p>

<h3>Talking About the Quick Calculation Method of Two-Item Exchange</h3>
<p>— Tianduo</p>
<p>Since Mr. Ouyang Renxian of this newspaper presented the 715 quick method for two-item exchange on April 6th, Mr. Wei, Mr. Ren, Mr. Ding, Mr. Yongxiang, and others have successively offered suggestions, grandiose arguments, or revisions and corrections. However, most of them can be divided into three types: 1. Using Western simplified quick calculation methods for calculation; 2. Using itemized calculation, formulating mnemonic rhymes, and then superimposing them; 3. Using the abacus method commonly used in our country, formulating mnemonic rhymes for calculation. However, because the various calculation methods have differences and lack detailed explanations, scholars have no standard to follow. Therefore, this article is drafted to collect the opinions of various scholars in this publication and to slightly add explanations to facilitate readers' understanding.</p>
<p>Now, let's first talk about the Western simplified quick calculation method.</p>
<p>Please refer to "Another Quick Method for Two-Item Exchange" and "The Simplest Two-Element Exchange Method" by Mr. Wei and Mr. Ding Chong in this publication on the 10th, 14th, and 15th of this month. Now, I will add more explanations for the following reasons:</p>
<p>The two-item exchange uses 1.4 as a fixed number to multiply the two numbers, and then subtracts one-thousandth of their product, and the result is this method. The formula is as follows:</p>
<p>Two-item exchange = (Two numbers X 1.4) − (Two numbers X 1.4 X 0.001) = Yuan number = Two numbers X (1.4) − (0.0014) = Two numbers X 1.3986</p>
<p>And 1.3986 is similar to the reciprocal of 0.715. 1.39860183, and the bar above indicates a cycle. In subsequent cases), the reciprocal of 0.715 is the quotient obtained by using one as the unit as the dividend and 0.715 as the divisor. Since the yuan uses 0.715 as the fixed price, the number of yuan per two is naturally the result of dividing one by 0.715. Now, the quotient of dividing one by 0.715 is as mentioned above, then compared with the fixed number of this method 1.3986 (that is, 1.4 minus 0.0014), the difference is only 0.0000013986. According to the approximate calculation rules, of course, the sixth decimal place and below do not need to be calculated, so this method adopts 1.4 minus 0.0014 as the fixed number. And the number 14 is because it is a two-digit number, and its tens digit is also one, which can also be used to apply a small quick method on the abacus. Now, I will describe its method as follows (readers can study it themselves). For example, 486753 multiplied by 14 equals 6814542. The formula is as follows (in the formula, in order to prevent errors in typesetting and facilitate practice on the abacus, commas are listed to highlight the correct position):</p>
<p>486753· Like setting now have silver four eight</p>
<p>·····12=3X4 Six seven five three two try to change</p>
<p>····20=5X4 For a certain number of yuan of course according to this</p>
<p>···28··=7X4 Method first multiply by one point four is six</p>
<p>··24···=6X4 Eight one four five four point two again</p>
<p>·32····=8X4 Subtract six eight one point four five</p>
<p>+16·····=4X4 Four two to get six eight zero seven seven two point seven four five eight yuan</p>
<p>6814542</p>
<p>This method is as simple and convenient as mentioned above, but there is one shortcoming, that is, when encountering a large number of 100,000 taels, it differs from the original accurate number by more than one jiao, three fen, and nine li, and there are two numbers that are clearly multiples of 715, but the resulting yuan number is slightly lacking. This situation seems to be a fly in the ointment.</p>
<p>2. The method of formulating mnemonic rhymes through itemized calculation and then superimposing. Please refer to Mr. Ren's "Another Quick Method for Two-Yuan Conversion" on April 11th and Mr. Yongxiang's "Correction of Another Quick Method for Two-Yuan Conversion" on the 17th.</p>
<p>At first, Mr. Ren's method also has the shortcomings of the first quick method. Although Mr. Yongxiang later added to it, it is still not perfect, and the mnemonic rhymes are lengthy and difficult to remember, and it involves many digits. Although the method is very quick, it is also a fly in the ointment.</p>
<p>3. The abacus method commonly used in our country</p>
<p>This method is the 715 quick method for two-item exchange made by Mr. Ouyang Renxian on April 6th. This method only lists mnemonic rhymes without explanation. Now I will slightly modify it and formulate an explanation as follows: (Mnemonic rhymes)</p>
<p>See one add two eight five</p>
<p>See two add five seven zero</p>
<p>See three change to four one four</p>
<p>See four change to five four two five</p>
<p>See five change to six seven one</p>
<p>See five make eight divide by seven two</p>
<p>See six change to eight two eight</p>
<p>See seven change to nine five six five</p>
<p>Meet seven one five advance twenty</p>
<p>Meet fourteen three advance double ten</p>
<p>This mnemonic rhyme is slightly different from Mr. Ouyang's mnemonic rhyme. It adds the sentence "Meet fourteen three advance double eleven," and changes "When one changes, two divide by four three," only taking the sentence "See five make eight divide by seven two," and deleting the rest.</p>
<p>(Explanation) "See one add two eight five" means that dividing one by 0.715 gets a quotient of one and still leaves 0.285. "See three change to four one four" means that dividing three by 0.715 gets a quotient of four and still leaves 0.14 (other cases are similar). "See five make eight divide by seven two" means that dividing five by 0.715, if the quotient is eight, then there is still a shortage of 0.72, so you should remove 72 from the stone bar. "Meet seven one five advance one ten" means that dividing 7.15 by 0.715 gets a quotient of ten. "Meet fourteen three advance double ten" means that dividing fourteen (on the one bar) .3 by 0.715 gets a quotient of twenty.</p>
<p>(Reason) Based on our country's abacus mnemonic rhymes, such as "four one changes to twenty-two," which means that dividing one by 0.4 gets a quotient of two and a remainder of two, this 715 returning division mnemonic rhyme is formed by adding changes.</p>
<p>(Algorithm) Calculate according to the abacus algorithm commonly used in our country.</p>
<p>(Note) The basic basis of this method is based on the principle of returning division by 0.715. Its advantage is of course that it can be equal to the correct number. To get a few decimal places, you can find a few decimal places. According to Duo, this method is not very fast and can only be called a quick 715 returning division method.</p>
<p>Since the three methods are as described above, readers, try one and repeat the experiment. When you can choose a simple 715 quick calculation method and memorize it for use.</p>

<p>Shop Assistants' Correspondence</p>
<h3>The Way Out for Learning</h3>
<p>Dear Editor:</p>
<p>Since your newspaper opened the "Shop Assistants' Correspondence" column, the questions answered have been mostly sufficient for our reference and inspiration. This spirit of serving society is truly worthy of our admiration and gratitude. Now I have a question that I would like to trouble you with. Please do not hesitate to instruct me and provide an answer. I am writing this in a scattered manner below:</p>
<p>I am a clerk in a XX Chinese medicine shop in this port. At the age of sixteen, driven by the need for food and clothing, I dropped out of school halfway through my studies and took a job as an apprentice in a shop filled with feudal colors. At that time, I felt the pain of missing out on education and often had thoughts of trying to escape. But in the end, because of the coercion of life, I endured a three-year term of imprisonment. I had sworn to myself that I was willing to give my all and not be afraid to fight hard against the environment. But the result disappointed me. Looking back on the past, I cannot help but feel endless sadness. However, there is no need for me to ramble on here.</p>
<p>I feel extremely disgusted with my current job and am no longer willing to succumb to this kind of situation. I will use my relatively strong spirit to break through the surrounding oppression. The only way is to leave my existing job and find another one. But I feel the threat of a lack of commercial knowledge. In my mind, there have also been latent thoughts of how to seek something. I subscribed to the delivery method at the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Library, but every time I read books such as bookkeeping, I closed my eyes and thought, and in the end I could not fully understand them. I also thought about going to night school to learn basic knowledge such as Chinese, English, and bookkeeping. But although I have such a plan, I am hesitant to proceed due to whether it is appropriate. I am a struggler under the remaining forces of feudalism, a wounded person under the iron hooves of capitalism. In the aftermath of groaning and panting, I deeply show weakness, only show weakness, but cannot get a glimmer of hope for relief. All my ideals are trapped in emptiness and etherealness. Where is my home? I sincerely look forward to</p>
<p>the instructions of the teacher. Before speaking, I cannot help but look forward to your command. Here, please,</p>
<p>Write in peace, Your sincerely, Yu Yinan</p>
<p>X X X X</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Yu's letter, in summary, is nothing more than the following two points: First, he feels extremely disgusted with his current job and wants to leave and find another one. Second, he feels that he lacks commercial knowledge and wants to learn some basic knowledge such as Chinese, English, and bookkeeping. Checking that Mr. Yu is now an employee in a Chinese medicine shop, so before answering you, we cannot but first talk about the status of the Chinese medicine industry. Our country's medicine has considerable value, and in some places, it may even be more ingenious than Western medicine. Therefore, in recent years, many medical theories and drugs have been adopted by Western medicine. Unfortunately, it has always been passed down unchanged, and no educated person has invented and organized it, so it cannot be valued by the world. Therefore, we believe that you are right to want to find an opportunity to make up for this shortcoming because of insufficient knowledge. This not only requires learning some basic knowledge, you can also go on to study the secrets of Chinese medicine. But you seek knowledge and want to abandon your old business and not do it, but we cannot agree. We hope that shop assistants in general can increase their knowledge within the possible scope. We do not hope that they will do what ordinary people consider more comfortable as soon as they have a little knowledge. Learning is used to improve society, and it is definitely not used to grab jobs. We have obtained higher knowledge and should not go to grab other people's existing jobs. We can use the knowledge we have obtained to gradually turn my current hard job into a lucrative one. This is the way for the public and me to benefit from it. As for your desire to learn some basic knowledge such as Chinese, English, and bookkeeping, we can tell you: In order to commemorate its 60th anniversary, this newspaper decided to spare its remaining energy to serve society and established an amateur cram school. Now, the first school attached to the Nanjing Road Continental Department Store Circulation Library of this newspaper has already started classes, but these days they are still registering there and preparing to expand it soon. At the same time, we have opened two branch schools at Chengzong Middle School on Tangshan Road in Hongkou and Zhongshan Cultural Education Center on Albert Road in the French Concession, and we are currently enrolling students. Our courses include Chinese, English, Russian, Japanese, bookkeeping, and mathematics. If you are interested in taking classes, you may wish to register at No. 345, Continental Department Store.</p>

<h3>Fleeting Moments in a Dream (Continuation 32)</h3>
<p>— Qin Shouou</p>
<p>"Before expulsion, a severe punishment is a must!" Liu Ji added resolutely.</p>
<p>"Expulsion is already the severest punishment; there's no need to make things difficult for him." Wu Yi勉强勉强 pretended to be calm, kindly pleading with Liu Ji.</p>
<p>"No! No! A severe penalty is absolutely necessary!"</p>
<p>"Please, President Wu, do not interfere with our freedom!"</p>
<p>Before Liu Ji could express his approval or disapproval, six or seven hundred spirited young people below the stage, unable to restrain themselves, stood up in unison with a stern and forceful attitude, expressing their opposition to old Doctor Wu's mediation. Wang Guodong, seeing that the principal couldn't save him, collapsed to the ground in despair.</p>
<p>"Well then, I have a proposition that I must ask you to accept," Wu Yi said very sincerely to his esteemed students. "Before you decide on a suitable form of punishment, I, in order to fulfill my responsibility and to avoid any complications with Wang Guodong's family, must request that you temporarily entrust him to my care. At the same time, I will ask the Director of Student Affairs, Mr. Wu, and the Dean of the Business School, Dr. Zhou, to represent me in discussing the specific methods of punishment with those of you on the committee."</p>
<p>Firstly, because Wu Yi usually spared no effort in supporting the students' patriotic movements, and secondly, because no one knew the relationship between Wang Guodong and old Doctor Wu, his proposal surprisingly gained the consent of the majority.</p>
<p>"But, President Wu, you must take full responsibility and not let him escape!" Chairman Liu Ji stated very solemnly again.</p>
<p>"Of course." Wu Yi helped Wang Guodong up from the ground, held his hand tightly, and retreated through a small door leading to the backstage from the main stage. Thousands of astonished gazes were focused on their receding figures. Even Wang Guodong didn't know what kind of trick this old principal was playing.</p>

<h3>Animals in Front of the Microphone</h3>
<p>— Shen Weng</p>
<p>Several Ingenious Techniques for Recording Animal Sounds</p>
<p>The roar of a Russian polar bear is louder than that of any other animal. The yawn of a lion is higher than its roar. If you want to record an elephant's cry, you must have many people making noise around it for it to bray loudly. Seals must be in an extremely quiet environment to bellow. Lions also have this habit. These are experiences that Franklin Hansen, head of the sound department at Paramount, gained from producing a beast film called "King of the Jungle."</p>
<p>Ordinary microphones sometimes fail to capture animal sounds effectively. Animals like tigers, leopards, and all cats often like to jump at things hanging from crossbars, just like kittens at home like to play with hanging balls. Therefore, sound recordists must take advantage of this point and use a specially made recorder to capture their sounds. This type of microphone must also be very precise, so that even the faintest sounds can be picked up from 500 feet away.</p>
<p>Sound technicians all agree that Russian polar bears are the best at yelling. These animals stand nearly seven feet tall and often weigh as much as nine hundred pounds, twice as large as ordinary lions. Because animal habits vary, the methods for recording animal sounds also differ. For example, when a Russian polar bear encounters anything blocking its cage, it will roar. If you want to record its cry, you simply need to hold something up in front of its cage.</p>
<p>According to sound technicians, the lion's roar is indeed terrifying; however, its snorts and yawns are also equally so. It is not easy to get these animals to roar. But when a cue is given, the moment of silence seems to give them a major jolt, and they suddenly roar.</p>
<p>Elephants are inherently lazy and calm animals. They will not make a ruckus unless they receive a very strong stimulus. Therefore, there is only one way to deal with them. Sound technicians simply have to make all sorts of noisy sounds next to them, and the thick-skinned animals will become restless. After a few more minutes, they will begin to cry out.</p>
<p>When they were recording seal calls, they tried many methods but ultimately failed. Later, they used the same method they used for lions to deal with them. They did indeed bellow for a while. The methods mentioned above have been tested repeatedly and are foolproof. Friends who want to record animal sounds may as well follow the methods above to test them out.</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>"Review of 'Madame Speculation'" MeineFrau Lie Hochstab Lerin</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>Perhaps the performance of this Ufa film at the New Shanghai Theater will be disappointing?</p>
<p>It is a very popular comedy in Germany, but in essence, it is a fantasy film, very empty, falling into the clichés of American or British productions.</p>
<p>The failure of the entire film lies in its plot. It tells the story of a bank clerk with a meager income who unfortunately marries a vain and extravagant wife. One day, she meets a wealthy sausage merchant. She uses her social skills to claim that her husband is a bank manager. The merchant is looking to borrow money to expand his business, so he tries his best to ingratiate himself. For the convenience of discussing matters, they arrange to meet in a large room at the most luxurious Royal Hotel in Berlin. She takes all the valuables from her home, planning to stay at the Royal Hotel for a week in order to succeed in her speculation. Unexpectedly, before any progress is made, her husband is fired from the bank, leaving them empty-handed and in a very difficult situation. At this time, a famous singer arrives at the hotel. She has had a falling out with her "mustard king" husband. Her husband says that anyone who can reconcile him with his wife will be rewarded handsomely. The unemployed clerk's wife then throws a grand banquet, pulling strings in the background. Coincidentally, the singer has a change of heart. The singer's husband agrees to have his mustard company cooperate with the sausage company and appoints the clerk as the general manager. Thus, the speculation is successful.</p>
<p>The ending, in which they get their wish, turns into a comedy, is really superfluous and meaningless. It is actually encouraging people to speculate and to greedily crave a comfortable life of dreams. It is really too worthless.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to technique, there are still undeniable strengths. It competes with MGM's "Grand Hotel" and Fox's blockbuster "State Fair." It features eight major stars, led by Will Rogers, Janet Gaynor, Lew Ayres, and Sally Eilers. The image shows Janet Gaynor and Lew Ayres.</p>
<p>The only advantage is the actors' performances. Kate Von Nagy, who plays the speculative wife, gives a vivid and excellent performance. She acts with meticulousness, without any affectation. The two songs she sings are also very pleasant to listen to. Her husband (the clerk), played by Heinz Kuebmann, portrays a cowardly man to perfection. The way they sing in harmony is also very good. Their delicate performances alone are enough to give the film artistic value. The others, such as Fritz Grunbaum, Theo Lingen, and Herman Vallenlin, are all famous German actors. Their performances are certainly commendable, but they are not important here, so I won't say anything about them.</p>
<p>The director has fulfilled his duty, but there is nothing particularly brilliant to be seen. Although there are few sets, they closely resemble those in "Grand Hotel" (nine-tenths of "Madame Speculation" takes place in the Royal Hotel), and they are still quite impressive. The use of camera angles and lighting configurations can both be considered remarkable achievements.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News from Tianyi</h3>
<p>— Peiyuan</p>
<p>Miss Li Xiao's second film, "Dawn," is scheduled to begin filming tomorrow. The male lead will be Tian Fang, a newcomer to Tianyi. According to those close to Miss Li, her recent actions have shifted from romantic to proactive. In her spare time, she studies film art at home. All frivolous young men who chase after her have been rejected. Even in dance halls, she is no longer seen.</p>
<p>Tianyi Company originally planned to relocate its film studio. However, because Shao Zuiweng couldn't find a suitable location for the time being, he decided to renovate the existing studio. This will block out various noises from outside, both loud and soft. He has also purchased several acres of vacant land nearby to build a larger, more complete film studio. He has recently hired engineers to design and draft plans. It is expected that construction can begin early next month.</p>
<p>Chen Yumei previously became ill from overwork while filming "Vitality." After recovering, she went to Ningbo with Shao Zuiweng to sweep tombs and tour various scenic spots and historical sites inside and outside the city, as well as the newly built Zhongshan Park. She has now returned to Shanghai. It is said that Chen is scheduled to record records at Pathé Records today, including "By the River Tower," "For Modern Misses," "The Bell Sound," "The Thrifty Song," and "The New Lullaby." It is also said that Chen has been appointed as a permanent record artist for Pathé.</p>
<p>Due to the constraints of the plot, the entire film has become a compilation of comical fragments. There are many dark scenes, and they are very appropriate. However, because it is a comedy, and for the sake of humor, the entire film cannot be tense.</p>
<p>There is a lot of dialogue, and much of it is interesting and funny. But in China, there are too few viewers who understand German, so some of the brilliance is inevitably diminished. Although it is a comedy, apart from the action, the dialogue does not elicit laughter from the audience at all, which is a great pity.</p>
<h3>The Central Propaganda Department Produces "Give Me Back Jehol"</h3>
<p>— Canlan</p>
<p>Recently Publicly Screened in Nanjing</p>
<p>Since the start of the Battle of Jehol, until its loss, Shanghai film companies had sent photographers to capture some footage to bring back. But unfortunately, there was very little substantive material, so it was delayed in being publicly screened.</p>
<p>News has arrived that a 10,000-foot film, "Give Me Back Jehol," has been publicly screened at the Central Auditorium in Nanjing. It was specially filmed by a commissioner sent by the Propaganda Department of the Central Party Headquarters to accompany the army.</p>
<p>The photography department of the Central Propaganda Department has only taken some news photos in the past few years, which have been used by various newspapers. Since the production of the sensational "National Crisis," although they have shot more than a dozen short newsreels of various conferences and the movements of great figures in Nanjing, they can only be considered short news films.</p>
<p>This time, "Give Me Back Jehol" was entirely self-produced by the Central government. From the loss of Shanhaiguan and the start of the battle at the Shi River, all the way to Xifengkou, Song Zheyuan actively resisted the Japanese and prepared to counterattack. It includes detailed accounts of the military situations at Gubeikou, Lengkou, and various other places. It has very detailed collection and depiction of the battles of Wan Fulin, Sun Dianying, and various volunteer armies (before the loss of Jehol). It describes the defensive work of isolated troops, flesh and blood flying, and a rain of bullets and shells. Its tragedy and tension are a hundred times greater than the previous "National Crisis."</p>
<p>Although this film does not show the satisfying sight of the Big Sword Team slaughtering the enemy, their departure and the bravery and might of their charge are indeed able to "transform scholars into warriors," inspiring many fine young men.</p>
<p>Haven't we long admired the Great Wall, one of the world's seven wonders? And haven't we also wanted to see the reality of Jehol, with its so-called high mountains and steep ridges, where "one man can hold the pass, and ten thousand cannot break through"? This film is very knowledgeable about the terrain of various strategic locations.</p>
<p>This film was shown to important figures in Beijing on April 10. Five copies have already been shipped out two days ago and will be publicly screened in Suzhou around the 25th. Of course, it will soon come to Shanghai.</p>
<p>Finally, I hope it will be publicly screened here soon so that the people of Shanghai can appreciate it. I also hope that "Give Me Back Jehol" will be realized in the near future.</p>
<h3>Xue Juexian's Imminent Return to Guangdong</h3>
<p>— Shumo</p>
<p>After completing the "White Gold Dragon" sound film, Xue Juexian of the Southern Company originally planned to go to the United States to study the film industry. However, due to other matters, it is temporarily difficult to do so. Moreover, the Global Overseas Chinese General Association has hired Xue as its representative in Guangzhou. Xue plans to return to Guangdong to solicit members and organize the Guangzhou branch. It is estimated that all tasks will take about a month to complete before returning to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Chevalier Doesn't Want to Marry Again</h3>
<p>— Sheng Hong</p>
<p>Recently, Chevalier gave an interview to a newspaper reporter. He said: "It's true, I'm already divorced from her. She is now resuming her stage career, and I wish her success. Maybe you already know, she is a singer and dancer. She is young, so success is extremely easy.</p>
<p>"But marriage—I—I don't want to marry again, because marriage, that bad thing, is enough to ruin everything. Think about it: a man spends the day filming in a film studio. When he returns home at night, he is so tired and his mind is so confused. At this time, the man certainly doesn't like to talk and doesn't like to go out. His wife sits at home all day with nothing to do, just eating and sleeping. When night comes, she is full of energy, either talking to the man or wanting the man to go out with her. The man certainly doesn't agree, so the two begin to quarrel. So I don't want to marry again!"</p>

<h3>Cavalcade (II)</h3>
<p>— Ne</p>
<p>"Robert, what does the Dutch farmers in South Africa have to do with us?" Qi Yin asked miserably.</p>
<p>"Doesn't it have anything to do with us? Your own brother is surrounded by the enemy in Mafeking, and there are many others waiting for rescue there."</p>
<p>"I understand." She straightened her back with difficulty, putting on a brave demeanor. "My temper is getting worse and worse. I won't be like this again next time. Robert, why don't we tell Ellen and Bridges to come and have a drink together, just this once? They are also a couple, and they also have a small child, and he is also going to join the army."</p>
<p>He kissed her: "Honey, you are really a sweet baby." He went to the door and called his male and female servants: "Ellen, Bridges, bring a few more glasses to help us welcome the new century."</p>
<p>As they drank spring wine, the children upstairs woke up. The sound of sobbing reached downstairs.</p>
<p>"This new century is too impolite, how can even the children be woken up?" Robert said, suddenly his mind lit up. "Hey, let's bring the children down too. Ellen, go get some milk, let them celebrate too."</p>
<p>"They won't sleep well at night, will they?" Qi Yin said.</p>
<p>"What does that matter? A hundred years only happens once," Robert explained. Qi Yin also laughed. They ran upstairs together. Qi Yin saw that the two little babies were still sleeping soundly. She said words of blessing, kissed them, and woke them up.</p>
<p>The two little babies, Edward and Joey, opened their eyes wide, bewildered, not knowing what day it was.</p>
<p>"Nineteen hundred:: a happy new century!" Robert raised his glass in celebration.</p>
