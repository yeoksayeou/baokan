<h3 id="c27">歐洲政局之一線生機 <a href="#c27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— 愼</p>
<p>德意志退出軍備縮小會議後。整個歐洲。雖未至如何緊張。面國際的僵局。則愈陷愈深。蓋德國堅主軍備平等。近已實行改編國防軍隊。數目超出凡爾賽和約規定一倍半以上。足以証明德國决不肯以躶身當四面之强隣。而法國及其衛星之中歐諸國。則以其全力維護凡爾賽和約。法國尤力持安全保障之主張。於是法德對立之形勢愈顯著。國際政治之危機亦愈積愈多矣。意大利於此。利用其舉足重輕之勢。東聯資本主義國所共畏之蘇聯。北携鬱鬱不得志之德國。以伸張其霸權。發揮其法西斯之運用。自改造國聯之議生。而意大利之國際地位。乃愈見提高。惟此舉爲法國所反對。英國亦難贊同。與法國相提携之中歐諸國。因亦反對意大利蔑視小國之國聯改造案。故國際聯盟改組之說。終將爲一種幻想之議案而已。况美國與蘇聯。皆各自有其獨特之立塲。一則對美洲各地。仍保持其傳統的門羅主義。擬在美洲建立經濟聯盟。對世界其他諸國。則僅謀在商務上之開拓。無論如何。皆不願輕於沾惹歐洲政局之糾紛。至於蘇聯。近來仍盡力維持其所謂國際和平之外交。不與資本主義國輕啓衅端。對於歐洲西部之爭執。更取純粹的旁觀主義。絕不致隨意參加。則意大利所提倡之改造國聯案。勢更不得不長期擱淺矣。</p>
<p>德國固仍持其强硬態度者也。一則彼深悉法國决不能以兵力干涉德國之内政。再則借以激勵德國國内之民衆。使其忘去當前經濟恐慌之痛苦。於是英吉利方面。提倡訂立德國境各國互不侵犯條約之說。遂喧騰一時。英外長西門遊歐。與此不無重大關係。查英國提倡此說之意。旣可以緩和德國之激劇要求。至少德國可再增加國防軍隊若干。又可以使法國對於其所謂之安全。獲得若干之新保障。雖此種條約。事實上未必眞有效用。但於目前僵化之局面。或可稍見轉機。現在法國對德擬增加民兵至三十萬人一事。可承認其增至二十萬。國際管理之四年試行監督期限。又可縮短至二年。德國於此。固未必即行承諾。但已開啓商量之機。法德之間。當不至如前此衝突之尖銳。暫時之和緩。又有增大之可能。</p>
<p>不過當前尙有一極堪顧慮之問題。其事雖小。在其實際性質亦或不至惹起危險。然而禍患之來。常有出乎一般預想之外者。此事爲何。即德國着手整理外債。宣佈外債利息減付現金是也。德意志銀行。頃已公佈一九三四年上半期到期債欵之解付辦法。對於債欵。僅允撥三成。其所借惟一口實。則爲德國輸出貿易衰落。較之一九三一年竟低落至十八億馬克之多。德國遭此損失之後。殊難付債。而債權國如英吉利者。則深以德之賴債爲不然。併指責德國近數月來德意志銀行之準備金。已增加至二千萬磅。每月貿易平衡。亦續有進步。現時而減付債息。實無理由云云。夫資本制度之下。所有權屬於神聖。絕對不可侵犯其意以爲一切法律之訂定。及一般社會之組織。莫不由乎鞏固所有權而防止人之侵越。其於國家民族間。又何莫不然。但自戰債問題發生之後。注一方面觀察。爲歐洲各國與北美合衆國間之對立關係。其實歐洲境内與南美金融凍結者。比比皆是。此雖屬於經濟恐慌之範圍。而債權神聖之動搖。亦已成不可諱言之事實。國家賴債之影響。勢將由小範圍而擴大至於各地可知也。當此世界皆陷於經濟恐慌之狂潮中。以本年十月份世界六十國貿易總額論。較之一九二九年每月平均輸入總値。減少百分之六四。輸出總値減少百之六十三。在最短期内。殊難有好轉之希望。則此綜錯複雜之國際形勢。能保其不因債務關係。而牽起政治上之糾紛乎。所謂緩和云者。特短時期内之緩和而已。</p>

<p>遠東貿易因可大增</p>
<p>倫敦觀察並不樂觀</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美總統今日批准今秋世界經濟會議中締結之倫敦白銀恊定、並准人民以新採白銀送造廠鑄造銀幣、</p>
<p>按照銀恊定　美政府在今後四年内、將以每盎斯六角四分半之價格、每年收購國内新採白銀二千四百萬盎斯、至美總統此次批推一舉、咸認爲政府之安定白銀計劃、冀得白銀派國會議員贊同政府貨幣政策、以分膨脹通貨派勢力、而免國會内發生膨脹通貨戰、</p>
<p>關於鑄造銀幣、總統布告内稱、案照國會法案、今後本國及屬地所採白銀、得送交造幣廠鑄造銀幣、但其送廠白銀、須以半數繳納政府、歸國庫收管、作爲鑄幣稅與手續費、其餘半數、鑄成銀幣後、交還原主、又稱、爲助成國内物價之安定、及保護國外貿易、免受外幣貶價之不利影響計、今見有提高銀價加以安定之必要云云、</p>
<p>美政府每年所擬收購銀數、略等於去年國内所採白銀總額、其價値則爲造幣廠内法定價格之一半、故欲送鑄銀幣者、須以半數繳納政府也、</p>
<p>現信總統此舉、將可綏靖産銀諸州之呼籲、銷納市上過剩之白銀、而同時增進美國在遠東之經濟地位、參議員畢德門前在倫敦會議爲商訂白銀恊定之主動人物、今日聞批准之訊、非常欣慰、謂該恊定諒可提高世界銀價、增加遠東購買力百分之五十、</p>
<p>按照白銀恊定、印度中國西班牙爲最大存銀國、均保證在四年内不以巨額白銀傾銷國外、美國·墨西哥·秘魯·澳大利亞·與加拿大爲最大産銀國、咸允限制産量、及收購所産一部份充鑄幣或通貨凖備之用、並酌定倘至明年四月一日、此恊定猶未完全批准、則存銀國可以不復遵守産銀國仍受拘束云、（二十一日國民電）</p>

<p>根據五月國會法案</p>
<p>總統有權鑄金銀幣</p>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統關於鑄造銀幣之佈告文、原文如下、</p>
<p>查一九三三年五月十二日所通過之國會法案第三章四十三節第二條、總統有權規定九成凈克冷之金元重量、</p>
<p>並規定九成凈克冷之銀元重量、其數量之多寡、如總統在調查後所覺爲穩定國内貨價或保護通貨所秘要者、總統參權照所定比率鑄造無限制之金銀硬幣、</p>
<p>又查依余調查之結果、余覺在助成國内物價穩定之際、並於遵守現所實行爲國會所准的政策與程序之時、爲保護吾人對外貿易以防低賤外幣之不良影響起見、銀價有提高與穩定之必要、</p>
<p>又查美代表團所提出决議案、於一九三三年七月二十七日由世界經濟會議六十六國代表致通過、規定各該政府放棄鎔化或减輕銀幣之政策與晉慣、規定低値銀票應以銀幣代之、規定不得成立可抑低銀價之立法案、</p>
<p>又查用銀國中國印度西班牙與産銀國澳洲加拿大墨西哥秘魯美國雙方所締結之補充恊定、載明中國允不鎔化或減輕銀幣、以售出其銀、印度允從一九三四年一月一日起不在四年内每年出售其銀超過三千五百萬盎斯、而西班牙亦允不在同一時期内每年出售其銀超過五百萬盎斯、印度與西班牙並允此後遵從世界經濟會議所通過之議案、</p>
<p>五産銀國政府顧及上述限制、故允各從其本國礦山收買若干現銀、産銀國所收銀額、每年爲三千五百萬盎斯、從一九三四年一月一日起、以四年爲期、此項收進之銀、由四國各保持四年、用以鑄幣、或充通貨凖備、而不得在四年内售諸市場、並諒解美國在此三千五百萬盎斯之總額中、將每年收進其國内所産之銀至少二四、四二一、四一○盎斯、以四年爲期、</p>
<p>現覺與他國政府合作、旣屬適宜、而提高並穩定國内物價、提高用銀國人民購買力、保護吾人對外商務、以防低値的外國通貨之不佳影響、及實行對於六十六國在上述决議案中之諒解、亦屬必要、余美總統羅斯福根據國會法案及其他志在國家復興的立法案所賦予之權力、並根據總統所具之其他權力、茲特佈告並飭令美國各鑄幣局得收入現銀、以便鑄造標凖銀幣、該局依照財政部長所揭示之規程、須查明其所收入之銀係從本佈告文之日期起、來自美國或美國治權下地方礦山者、</p>
<p>鑄幣局局長得原主　之自願同意後、須將其收入之銀扣留百分之五十爲鑄幣稅、及美政府代其鑄幣與運送銀幣之費用、其餘百分之五十、須鑄成標凖銀幣、悉數交與原主、</p>
<p>扣留之百分五十現銀、由財政部保存之、除鑄造美國銀幣外、不得在一九三七年十二月底以前售出之、</p>
<p>財政部長有權得擬定規程、以實施本佈告文、此項規程應載有前根據四月二十三日國會法案即所謂畢特門案者而製定之條欵、並酌加變更、俾决定方法、如何審查此銀係在本佈告文日期後來自美國或美國治權下地方礦山者、</p>

<p>北平通訊、達賴逝世消息傳到北平後、蒙藏委員會駐平辦事處即到電南京蒙藏委員會詢問眞相、今日（二十一日）尙無復電到平、旅平藏人以喇嘛爲多、對於藏事甚爲關懷、今日（二十一日）孫伯莊女士等赴班禪辦公處有所洽商、據藏人方面傳出確息、達賴代表棍却仲尼、二十日以前來平、曾向人表示、達賴年老、萬一仙遊、承繼者頗爲重要、達賴生平、並不親英、原意要求中央派兵保護西藏、以免一旦有事、又感鞭長莫及之慮、棍却仲尼本擬赴江西晋謁蔣委員長、請示一切、不料達賴已於十七日在拉薩逝世、新達賴之産生甚難、因喇嘛敎禁止結婚、達賴無妻無子、故此刻無承繼者、暫由司倫噶厦及伊蒼代行西藏政治宗敎職務、惟司倫等能否於過渡期間主持一切、尙不敢斷言其勝任、達賴未死以前、對於西藏青年思想之急進者、設法勸導、一部分西藏青年、咸認爲達賴壓迫青年、但亦無特殊之行動、現達賴已死、依宗敎之價例、必須算卦、算出某處嬰兒産生、此嬰兒特别神明、能指出何物何名、於是衆人認爲達賴轉世、遂由司倫噶厦伊蒼等前往迎歸拉薩、行呼畢勒罕典禮、於是此嬰兒不復爲民家子弟、即成爲新達賴活佛、俟成年後、即可繼位、掌握西藏政治宗敎大權、惟新達賴之繼位不知何年何月何是、英人埀涎西藏已久、在青黄不接之過渡時期、如司倫等能服衆望、維持得法、則西藏猶可苟安、否則中央必須派員入藏、恊助司倫等維持治安、因西藏問題較内蒙自治問題尤爲重要也、現西藏民衆分二派、一派擁護達賴、多紅敎徒、前藏人士佔多數、另一派擁護班禪、多黄敎徒、後藏人士佔多數、實際上二派均無嚴明之系統、不問政治、只知念經、但藏人中以擁護達賴者爲較多也、</p>
<p>達賴圓寂後、西藏政敎頓失重心、現在滯留百靈廟之班禪額爾德尼、回藏當可不成問題、緣今夏班禪曾派員入藏接洽、當有三大寺表示歡迎、現達賴旣已圓寂、藏政主持需人、自易早日實現、惟其間尙不無多少阻碍、必須先行疏通、班禪定國歷年後、離廟過平、留二三日即晉京、分謁國府各要人、除報告内蒙自治問題解决經過外、並將請示回藏辦法、據接近班禪之藏人阿善升談稱、班禪對於西藏政治軍事、素不過問、在西藏時亦僅主持宗敎上事宜、此次回藏、以中央之意志爲意志、宣慰藏民、並爲新達賴授以經典云云、</p>

<p>失業驟增六萬生計頓起恐慌</p>

<p>大公社云、本市各繅廠、因受日絲領銷歐美影響、以致絲價暴跌、無法維持、相繼停業、失業工人、驟增六萬餘、生計頓起恐慌、昨日上午、各繅絲工會、聯合各廠工人代表、分向黨政機關請願、要求轉呈中央、予以救濟、茲誌各情如下、</p>

<p>該會常委李升伯談話</p>
<p>大公社云、棉業統制委員會、前以華商紗布交易所存紗過多、影響市場、爲穩定紗價起見、特組織合興公司、收買一部份存紗、以冀流通市面、並呈由實部令交易所、於十月份起、不得再交新紗、以示限制、大公社記者、昨赴棉統會、探詢此事處置經過詳情、及今後正本清源辦法、當由該會常委李升伯接見、承告甚詳、</p>
<h3 id="c119">收買存紗原因 <a href="#c119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>首據李氏稱、當紗價極度不振之時、適値秋銷發動之際、但因市價日短、紗商不敢放手營業、而農民則無紗可織、於是紗布交易所存紗、愈積愈厚、斯時紗交共有存紗三萬六千包、市面愈跌愈烈、棉業統制會、爲穩定市價、設法疏通計、乃商由上海之永安、無錫之慶豐、南通之大生、三紗廠、組織合興公司、出資收去一萬五千包、以爲市價穩定之後、則紗商亦可放膽採購、則其他二萬一千包之存紗、當可逐漸出清、此爲組織公司收買存紗、以穩定市價之最大原因也、</p>
<h3 id="c120">違約續解新紗 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>不意自合興公司收去一萬五千包之後、而申新廠又繼續以次紗解進八千包、紗布交易所、限於所定規章、不加制止、棉統會鑒於此種情况、爲斧底抽薪計、乃呈准實部、令飭交易所、自十月份起之新交易、不許以新紗解所、一方面對於所内、連新解進之次紗八千包、共二萬九千包、由紗廠聯合會等會同設法出清、因紗廠聯合會、於七月間曾有一决議案、限制各廠停解新紗也、</p>
<h3 id="c121">出清存紗辦法 <a href="#c121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>經杭統會與紗廠聯合會及紗布交易所三方面會商之結果、該項存紗、已决定由申新廠收去七千包、交易所收去一萬包、規定價格爲每包一百七十元、此項定價、爲十五年來之最低價格、卽使運往内地銷售、當亦不致折本、合同業已訂就、並已呈請實部備案、統限本年年底内收清、</p>
<h3 id="c122">收買存紗損失 <a href="#c122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>所收之一萬五千包存紗、現已陸續銷注各方面者、計有一萬二千包、尙餘三千包、未獲脫手、但本年年底、亦决定出清、統扯每包約須虧折六七元、共計損失約十餘萬元、棉統會於此事發動之初、本擬要求中央撥欵四百萬、預備將此項次紗、完全收去、嗣因宋去孔來、財長交替、而中間又以閩變突起、政府財政竭蹶、遂被擱置、否則此種困難、已早解决、固毋須大費周章也、</p>
<h3 id="c123">標準分級限制 <a href="#c123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>棉統會爲防止以後再有此種弊病計、對於交易所現定標準、擬以科學方法、重行釐訂、如拉力纖維色光牌等等、均合於百分者、得採取爲標凖、辦法與章程、已在擬訂中、俟擬定再由交易所認爲無訛、然後呈部備案實施、大致以一元爲一級如不滿七十分者、卽屬爲不合等級、交易所當不予收受、棉統會並擬派專家八人、會同在所鑑定云云、</p>

<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>提起了中國，便不期然而然的會聯想到地大物博。雖然東北四省，已非我有，可是提起了中國，依然難都會聯想到地大物博</p>
<p>說起了地大物博，我又覺得是十分矛盾。據海關的報告，自有海關以來，是没有一年出口貨超過進口的。不論是吃的，喝的，穿的，用的，讀的，瞧的，代步用的，以及各種工業原料，無不仰給於舶來品。由此，我們便該自己掌着自己的嘴巴而問題：「物博麽？」</p>
<p>偌大的一個中國，所有運銷外洋的東西，揭開天窗說亮話，就只有「絲」，「茶」。絲茶貿易，這幾年來的衰敗且不說，就以旺銷時期而論，何嘗與各國市場，有過直接的交易。反正是同駐華的進出口洋行，做一些小規模的買賣而已。若是各國洋商不來中國做這販賣的玩意兒，說也可憐，我們中國雖然地大物博，各國市塲上，或許還没發見過中國絲茶呢。</p>
<p>這並不是作者過甚其辭，事實的確是如此。再說得没志氣些，更有不少的例子。若是外洋船不玩帶黄魚的把戲，今日的歐洲大陸上，决不會有這許多青田小販。假使西洋的敎士，不把中國的金蓮，豚尾等東方古國的文明介紹到世界各國去，或許西方人到現在，還不能熟悉中國的情形。大家請想罷，這些，都不能自己直接出口，而不得不求於人，更那裏談得上正式的商品。</p>
<p>但是近來却有「中國水菓，直接運銷外洋」的計劃了。妙，這或許是交進了下元局運，所以才會得這麽地抬頭，開中國出口貨的天字第一號紀錄。這自然是千載難逢的機會，怎得不令我雀躍三千。不過我希望水菓商們，努力地替地大物博的中國，殺開一條直接出口的大路，勿使外國消費者，證實「這是劣等民族的生産品」才好。否則，唉，我不忍說了。</p>

<p>— 徐豪吾</p>
<p>自從歐文ＷashingtonＩrving說過了「節用了棒子，縱壞了兒子」的一句話後，素來主張「棒頭上出孝子」的中國「哲學家」，就可以「引經據典」，傲慢自若地說一聲：「吾道不孤！」</p>
<p>誠然，小兒女們愚昩無知，容易縱性任情：做父母的站在撫養和監督的立場上面，極應該嚴加開導，嚴加約束，以盡做父母的責任，但是事實往往「離題」的。</p>
<p>我親眼看見一個小女兒，伊那襤褸的衣衫，萎黄的皮膚，瘦削的肌肉，浮腫的臉龐，不用說，一望而知，伊生來就没有享富貴爹娘的福氣，常常伊的小腮兒鼓着，小脣兒翕着，小眉毛兒微蹙着；坐在那裏，可以坐上幾個鐘頭，不動聲色丨除非有人問伊，伊纔回答一二句，要是呌伊走動走動吧，我不好說伊没有走動丨嘿丨伊怎好不走動？不過伊脚移，手蕩，總是這樣慢慢的，機械式地，没氣力地，不要說，活潑天眞，就是最低限度的生人活氣，實在竟找不出一點！</p>
<p>人家背地裏對我說：「伊的父母眞厲害丨多說要打；不聽要打；就是一點没有事，發起脾氣來也要打；打！打！打！」</p>
<p>細一思量，伊的母親倒還是生身母親呢；自肉自痛，有時還不免要有懊悔的地方，要是那一班早年失恃，日處在繼母淫威下的苦兒女們，身上穿了一件蘆花墊的襖子，在外人看來，何等輕軟鬆厚，做繼母的何等輕憐密愛；實際呢？含悲茹苦，飲泣吞聲；天下不乏身歷其境者，何必要我這樣没有經歷的人，來「隔靴搔癢呢」？</p>
<p>問題到這裏，已不在乎家境的寛裕不寛裕，事實如此，習俗相沿如此；要不然，不成其爲「聲名顯赫」的「繼母」了哇！</p>
<p>姑且讓我抛開那許多溺愛不明的賢父母不談，就是由「約束」而鞭撻，由鞭撻而葬送兒女的幸福，汨滅兒女的天眞，桎梏兒女的自由，並且在那一塵不染的小心靈上面，深深地鐫刻著人類殘忍，凶暴，刻毒的形像，因而留下厭世嫉俗的禍根的父母們，雖然栽培「孝子」之心可嘉，恐不免有非議的地方；（「天下無不是的父母」，狂言該打！）好在這還有「遺敎」可遵呢！</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>願你晚安！」這雖是一句平常的應酬語，可是對方裝着和善的笑臉；轉着柔婉的聲調，你聽了雖不會遍體舒暢，然而也决不會討厭的。因爲他和你道一聲安，總包含着若干的敬意。</p>
<p>然而在上海居住的人們，還有一種特别的晚安，請你領受。這一種安是猙獰的，粗暴的，也使你有相當的代價，付給他們。</p>
<p>海關上的大鐘，噹噹的打了二下，這時馬路上靜悄悄地，祗有幾輛人力軍，没精打彩地曳着：賣小食的擔子，微閃着燐火般的燈光。那有錢的先生們和太太們，有的醉歌方歇：有的舞倦歸來。你要是坐了摩託卡，或是家居在熱鬧區域，當然歸來的路上，没有甚麽意外發生。倘使你坐了人力車，或徒步走着，而且你的家又在僻野的路上。在這寒風凛烈，燈光黯淡中，橫裏會躍出幾個大漢，攔住你的去路。又把那黑漆生光的手槍，對着你的要部，邊說道：「喂！朋友，識相些，不要響！」</p>
<p>你要是漂亮的朋友，一任他們擺佈，没收了你的錢袋；卸除了你的衣服，任他們揚長而去，只好自認晦氣。你要是不識相而大呼小呌，探捕未曾降臨，倒先請你吃一下苦頭，這未免不値得。所以逢着了向你請特别晚安的人，惟有服服貼貼的接受，爽爽快快的出代價。除此以外，還有甚麽法子想呢？</p>
<p>我的親戚某君，有一天晚上，也逢到了　特别晚安的人。因爲他身邊没帶錢鈔，所以幾位請安的人，十分的懊喪。除了没收衣服以外，還把他一雙精光生亮的皮鞋剥去，害得他光着襪子，走回家裏。</p>
<p>還有一次，有二位女客，坐了人力車回家，半路上也遇見了幾位請晚安的人。他們也知道「男女有别」，不向伊們身上搜查。一位是没帶現錢，所以損失了一件絨線大衣。一位却去掉一隻手提皮篋，内中藏着十幾塊現洋。事後據伊們自述：「要是這幾位請安的人，向伊們身上細細搜查，貼肉的衣袋中，却有好幾十元鈔票咧！」</p>
<p>「剥猪攞」。你想半路上遇見了這種暴客，衣服金錢損失以外，還要遭受惡駡，豈不是兩重損失嗎？所以我提議這「剥猪攞」三字，加以廢除。凡是受過這種寵錫的人，一定大加贊成的咧！</p>

<p>第二十回　卜吉有期老人連日笑剷愁不盡舊雨對門居</p>
<p>是他爲了我犧牲很大，他而且起了誓，不發財不回哥哥家來。現在他不見得發了財，何以又回到哥哥家裏來呢？莫非這也爲的是我？若說這也爲的是我，我却把什麽去安慰人家？見人家一面怪難爲情的。用好話去安慰他幾句，也透着無聊，而且也冒很大的嫌疑。再說，就安慰他一番，讓他不要把我放在心裏。據我看來，没有這番安慰倒也罷了，若有了這番安慰，恐怕更要念我念得厲害呢。桂枝如此一轉念頭，就决計把甘二爺置之不理。到了晚上睡覺的時候，想起枕頭套子裏面，還有積之一張相片，這個東西，放在自己身邊，遲早是惹禍的根苗，而且他也總合作怪，把自己的心事擾亂了，不如收在一個永不見面的地方罷。可是到了母親睡覺以後，自己一摸那相片時，並不在枕頭套子裏，却是在墊褥上面，將枕頭來壓蓋着。自己記得清清楚楚，是塞在枕頭套子裏的，何以會掉換了一個地方？莫非是讓母親看到了嗎？若是果讓母親看到了的話，顯着我還有二心，他是一個守舊的人，那更看我不起了。當時屋子裏無燈，也不敢亮上燈火，摸着黑就把那相片扔在坑夾縫裏，預備等着母親不在家的時候，再找一個妥當的地方來收着。當晚加了這一重心事，翻來覆去，總是睡不着，到了次日，自然起來得更晚了。睜開眼來的時候，早見母親口裏啣了一枝烟捲，斜坐在房門邊方凳子上。母親是個不抽烟的人，自己是知道的，這又是心裏極端的不自在，所以在那裏抽着烟解悶，帶想心事了。這或者與枕頭下那張相片，有點關係吧？（二七五）</p>

<h3 id="c206">調幅的重要性 <a href="#c206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— 石華玉</p>
<p>我們收聽遠地播音台的時候，爲什麽要注意牠的調幅呢？原來收到遠地電台聲音的輕響，和牠的調幅成分有很大的關係的。因爲響度正比例於電場强度之平方與調幅。今以Ｌ表元響度，Ｆ爲電場强度，Ｍ爲調幅，則得公式於下：</p>
<p>Ｆ２×Ｍ＝Ｌ</p>
<p>例如我們收一遠地的電台、牠的調幅假定３３１－３％：弄收一另外的遠地電台，調幅是６６２－３％：如果兩電台的電力相等，那末我們收到前者的聲音祗有後者一半那麽響。所以我們可以從上面的公式裏看出，收遠地電台聲音的輕響和她的電力果然有關係，但調幅也很有關係的，而且調幅比電力更重要些！因爲Ｆ的平方才和Ｌ是正比例的。</p>
<p>現在假定有兩個遠地電台Ａ和Ｂ，Ａ電台的Ｆ是每米突二千分弗打（Ｍ（）illivolt／Ｍeter），調幅５０％·Ｂ電台的Ｆ是每米突一·五千分弗打，Ｍ＝８０％·試問我們收到的聲音響度的比例又怎樣呢？照上面的式子就很容易算出來了。</p>
<p>Ａ電台：２２×０．６＝２．４</p>
<p>Ｂ電台：１．５２×０．８＝１．８</p>
<p>Ｌ的比例是２．４：１．８＝４：３</p>
<p>又如Ｃ電台的Ｆ是每米突○·七千分弗打，調福是１００％；Ｄ電台的Ｅ是每米突○·五千分弗打，調幅５０％·那末，</p>
<p>Ｃ電台：　０．７２×１００＝０．４９</p>
<p>Ｄ電台：　０．５２×０．５＝０．１２５</p>
<p>兩電台Ｆ的比例是７：５，Ｌ的比例是４：１，由上面所得的兩個比例可見調幅比電力更重要的理由了。所以一個强力的電台，如果調幅百分率不夠，雖然電力强，也不會有好成績的。</p>

<h3 id="c208">三極管電力輸出與失眞度之計算 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 一知</p>
<p>三極管的電力團出與失眞度不能超出其特性的固定値，否則放音即致模糊，所以用三極管作放大作用，其輸出的電力與失眞度，應先計及，使不致輸出過度而失眞，現各眞空管製造廠每在出售的眞空管上，附其特性表，以備檢用，可省去計算，然我人應知其計算的方法，設遇該眞空管的電力輸出與失眞度未註明時，則自可計算以求得？</p>
<p>眞空管的柵極，當受輸入訊號的交流超峯電壓激勵時，若爲正半波，則自柵位等於零；若爲負半波激勵，則自柵位變成原來的二倍，因此柵壓激勵，指出最大及最小的電壓與電流·電力輸出即可用下列公式計算　：</p>
<p>電力輸出＝（最大電流－最小電流）×（最大電流－最小電流）－８</p>
<p>二次諧振失眞度百分數，可用下列公式計算之：</p>
<p>二次諧振失眞度＝（最大電流＋最小電流）－負載電流－２－最大電流－最小電流×１００</p>
<p>例如：某三極管屛壓爲２５０弗打，屛流爲３４千分安，柵壓爲５０弗打，負載耗阻爲３９００歐姆，其屛壓與屛流ＥＰＩＰ的特性曲線如圖所示，求其電力輸出與失眞度値。</p>
<p>解：在圖上經Ｐ點（即柵壓５０弗打，屛壓２５０弗打時應有的電流３４千分安交叉點）作直線Ｘy平行ＡＢ·ＡＢ線作在Ｍ與Ｏ兩點間Ｍ點爲屛壓２５０弗打與屛流零安交叉點，Ｑ點爲屛壓零弗打與屛流等其屛壓２５０弗打爲屛極耗阻３９００歐姆除得商數的交叉點，其商數即：２５÷３９０＝６４千分安，乃用上列公式可求得：</p>
<p>電力輸出＝（６６－７）×（３６０－１３０）－８＝１７００千分瓦特</p>
<p>諧振失眞度以公式求得之則：</p>
<p>二次諧振失眞度＝０．０６６＋０．００７－２－０．０６６－０．００７×１００＝４．２％</p>
<p>眞空管的失眞度不得超過５％，其負載耗阻在最佳工作點約爲屛阻的兩倍，此二問題於眞空管上甚爲重要，所以附述之。</p>
<h3 id="c209">電力與音量之比率丨Ｄecibel之意義丨 <a href="#c209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— 李元慶</p>
<p>計算平常二物件的關係，大槪都是很簡單的。譬如電池一瓶，售洋一元，那麽，化了二元錢，便可買到二瓶：五元錢便可買到五瓶；………總之；化了幾元錢，便可買到幾瓶電池。此種有規則的變化，在數學上稱爲直綫的比率。（ＬinearＲatio）</p>
<p>在無綫電内，音量與電力的關係，却並不這樣簡單。譬如將收音機的電力，加多半倍，輸出的音量，在普通人聽來，簡直無甚分别。二倍收音機的電力，音量上也祇能得到些微的變動。實際上四倍收音機的電力，纔能得到二倍的音量。</p>
<p>我們知道聲浪的發生，是由於物體的振動，振動力大，聲浪也大；振動力小，聲浪也小；但是振動力大小與聲浪强弱的變化，是不規則的丨丨不是直線的比率，乃是對數的比率。（ＬogarithmicＲatio）</p>
<p>計算電力與音量的比率，通常使用的方法，是一種倍爾制。（ＢelＳystem）在倍爾制内，十倍電力後，音量方面的收獲，稱爲一倍爾。但是在無綫電工程上，很少有增加一倍百倍電力的情形發生，所以一倍爾在實用上便嫌太大，因此便將倍爾分做十個小倍爾丨丨每一個小倍爾（Ｄecibel）等於倍爾十分之一。</p>
<p>依照普通情形看來，十倍電力能得到十個小倍爾，（即一倍爾）那麽，四倍電力便祗能得到四個小倍爾；二位電力，便祗能得到二個小倍爾了。但是在事實上却並不這樣！</p>
<p>上面已說過，電力與音量的關係，是一種對數的比率，這樣，便知倍爾是依了「電力倍數」的對數而變化的。拿去式來表示，便是：Ｂel　１０gＰ１－Ｐ２</p>
<p>Ｄecibel　１０　１０gＰ１Ｐ２（Ｐ１第一電力）（Ｐ２第二電力）</p>
<p>譬如收音機的輸出力，原來爲二百密立華特，（Ｍilliwatt）（Ｐ１）現在加至四百密立華特（Ｐ２）後，依上述公式，得；</p>
<p>Ｄecibel＝１０　１０g４００－２００＝１０　１０g２＝１０Ｘ．３＝３（待續）</p>

<p>— 熙</p>
<p>中國的萬里長城是和埃及的金字塔一樣爲世界聞名的偉大而又古老的建築之一。最近史家房龍在他的著作裏描寫中國的長城說：「…沿黄海岸的中國肥沃平原，始終是對于中央亞細亞的剛强侵入者開放着。爲要彌補這個缺點，紀元前三世紀時的中國皇帝造了一條巨大的城牆，一千五百哩長，二十呎闊，三十多呎高，從遼東灣起一直到戈壁沙漠邊上意州城西的嘉峪關爲止。這條花崗石的屛障曾經好好的盡過它的職。十七世紀中，滿洲人猛襲而來，它却不能抵擋了。但是，一條維持差不多二千年的防禦物，畢竟是非同小可的，我們如今所造的城牆，過了十年就要無用，又須拿極大的費用去重築了。……」這話是贊美還是嘲笑，我體會不出來。不過長城在漢朝以後滿清以前，的確曾盡過一番保境安民的義務。誰說是從漢朝到現在，凡是讀書人，没有一個不駡秦始皇，可是這一點我們應替秦始皇伸一伸寃，倘使不是這位專制魔王造下這條巨大的城牆，擋住胡人的侵略，也許胡人早已南下牧馬，而我們要有幾千年讀不成四書了。</p>
<p>自從中國的版圖向北擴充到薩彦嶺，長城便成爲祇供遊覽賞玩的東西，雖然在奉直之戰，它也好像爲雙方盡過一點義務，可是這是中國人自己的小事，不足稱道，總之這幾百年來，長城的確是已死去了。</p>
<p>然而天下事竟不可料，死了幾百年的長城，在九一八瀋陽之變以後，接二連三地經過了一些巧妙的變遷，現在居然復活了，牠不單是替我們服務，而且在替我們的侵略者服務。這樣的一番「化腐朽而爲神奇」的奇績，不要說去今二十年的專制暴君秦始皇料不到，即現代的地理家房龍也是料不到的。房龍贊美它是一條維持二千多年的防禦物，而我們現在還不知道它再要維持幾多年！想到這裏，我眞不能不跟着房龍贊美它一聲「畢竟非同小可」！</p>
<h3 id="c242">在雅片小賣所裏 <a href="#c242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>一個朋友領我走進了「滿洲國」的一家雅片小賣所，它的名字是「醉仙居」。</p>
<p>時候是在夜晚，一進屋，就彷彿置身在别一個世界裏。在這個世界裏，没有光明的太陽，没有清新的空氣，它有的是刺激性强烈的異香，和烟霧迷濛中時隱時現的一些晦冥的燈光。大槪這就是仙人們醉臥的福地了。慶賀我自已，也作了一次仙人。</p>
<p>一間大屋子，相對地搭着板炕，兩面炕上全睡滿了人，小的烟燈，香的烟味，「吃啦」「吃啦」的烟嘯聲，驅使着所有的人們走向仙境。</p>
<p>「來麽，你老。」</p>
<p>就像飯館裏的堂官似的，一個手裏端着烟盤子的侍者，向我們打着招呼，然後就往那大炕上僅有的一塊空餘地方上讓着。</p>
<p>虧得他這麽一喊，把我又重呌回人世，而我面前的一切現象，就隨着脫出了仙境。</p>
<p>我的朋友，一個在哈爾濱世面混了好些年的人，對於社會上的事情，是有着相當經騐的，他站在屋地上一動不動，僅只溜着斜視的眼睛。他這麽着是有作用的，不錯，那個侍者改換了話頭：</p>
<p>「啊，你們先生要到雅座麽」？</p>
<p>問這麽一句，還不等我們點一點頭，他就又接着喊：</p>
<p>「雅座，兩客」！</p>
<p>跨出大屋子，跟着我的朋友走到後院，那裏就是雅座，一小間一小間的單間，猛然一看，和飯館的設置没有什麽兩樣。在我，是没有想到小賣所中還分着座次，局面竟有這麽大。</p>
<p>可是，我爲一種女人的怪笑聲弄楞了，就向我的朋友悄悄地問着：</p>
<p>「怎麽，這裏還有女人來麽」？</p>
<p>「不是，一會你就知道的」。</p>
<p>等他說完話，我就陪他躺上雅座的板炕上，一舖小板炕，讓我們兩人躺下身子，中間只能容下那一只烟燈。侍者走過來，拿出兩個烟泡，一面笑着說：</p>
<p>「二位先生，呌一個玩玩吧」？</p>
<p>我的朋友望着我笑，我明白他笑的意思了，他是回答我剛才問他的問題的，我才知道這裏的女人是屬於賣淫一類的</p>
<p>「怎麽樣」？</p>
<p>他徴求我的意見，我搖搖頭。</p>
<p>這一來，可讓他見笑了：</p>
<p>「老朋友，南邊北邊走這些年，還没有學一點乖玩意兒。呌一個，一定要呌一個」。</p>
<p>他打發侍者去了，我也不再多說什麽話，反正我是來觀光的，多看到一點，自然是比看不到要强些的。不過，說句老實話，在這類塲面上，我實在是個低能兒，甚至於一提到就要紅臉的。</p>
<p>我看我的朋友燒烟。因爲事前和他定好，我是絕對不吸一口的，所以他燒好就自已吸起來，再没有向我謙讓。我看他吸着，烟一口一口地噴着，忽然間，我感到這事情很有詩意。從燒烟，到吸在肚子裏，再把餘剩的烟噴出來，這還要有相當的藝術修養才行呢。可是，我一想到這一枝槍，可以毁壞了一個人的一生，以及現在的「滿洲國」，在日本帝國主義者的指使下行使着雅片公賣來消滅滿洲人民反抗的雄心與勇力，就把感到的詩意全驅散了，而那飄散着的烟霧，對於我恰是一層突不破的愁雲。</p>
<p>當那個女人把黄瘦的臉孔露在門口時，我立起身和我的朋友告辭了，我跟他說：</p>
<p>「朋友，不行，我有點不舒服，頭痛呢，讓我先回去罷」。</p>
<h3 id="c243">納蘭成德的詩論（續） <a href="#c243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— 陳梁</p>
<p>六</p>
<p>此外，關於聲韻的研究，詩體的起源，納蘭成德也都有研究，這裏没有一一介紹到的可能了。但從已經論到的看去，我們也可以知道他是怎樣的一個學識淵博，研究精深的學者。他的成功，證以渌水亭雜識，與其說是由於天才，倒不如說來自刻苦的學習，這是非常値得我們注意的，這是讀飲水詩詞不能令我們想到的。而在這書裏，還有一條，雖是論的其他方面事，但他的要批評别人先要去了解别人的精神，是極其可貴。今世學者（？）多不先求了解别人學術而亂駡人的，納蘭成德的意見，我想對於他們也是很有益處。在兩重意義之下，我就節引這一條文字來作爲本文的結論：</p>
<p>若不讀其書，不知其道，惟持一家之說，衝口亂駡，只自見其孤陋耳。…大抵一家人相聚，只說得一家話，自許英傑，不自知孤陋也。讀書多貴細，學問貴廣貴實。開口捉筆，驅馬不及，非易事也</p>

<p>— 殊</p>
<p>十六</p>
<p>放翁「老學庬筆記」載：</p>
<p>劉韶美在都下，累年不以家行，得俸專以傳書，書必三本，雖數百卷爲一部者亦然。出局則杜門校讎，不與客接。旣歸蜀，亦分作三船，以備失壞。已而行至秭歸新灘，一舟爲灘石所敗，餘二舟無他，遂以歸普慈築閣貯之。</p>
<p>劉韶美的愛書，眞可謂保護得異常周至。不過，這種辦法雖好，究竟不是窮小子辦得到的事，正等於望着不折賣的「四庫全書」，除掉讚歎以外，别無辦法。說到「四庫全書」，我想到瀋陽的一部了，當年就爲着預防損失，特地寫了四部，分放在四個地方，等於劉韶美的「三船」計劃。可是劉韶美的書，結果是由三而二，「四庫」也由四而三，在這三之中，且祗有杭州「文瀾閣」的一部最完全。如果「文瀾閣」再…那怎麽辦呢？這個我想是没有什麽問題的，因爲已經又在預備了；還印「四庫全書」的緣起上，說得明明白白，從四部而增多至一千部了；再搬一兩部去，又算得什麽呢？中國有的是地方；有的是書，從來就「樂善好施，來者不拒」的。</p>
<p>十七</p>
<p>文廷式「聞塵偶記」，内收臺灣之役的史料甚多其間有一則說：</p>
<p>「和議成後，有人題城門上一聯云：</p>
<p>萬壽無疆，普天同慶：</p>
<p>三軍敗績，割地求和。</p>
<p>旣而又傳一聯云：</p>
<p>臺灣省已歸日本，</p>
<p>頤和園又搭天棚」。</p>
<p>當時民間憤慨，皇家的歡愉，於此可知。</p>
<h3 id="c245">兩兄弟（六）（七） <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑李維克著譯</p>
<p>他以一種短促的，斬碎的，差不多是不連貫的，一種患有幻覺者的話語說着。</p>
<p>他現在似乎忘記了哲安和那在鄰室的他的母親。他旁若無人地說着，因爲他非說不可，因爲他實在太痛苦了，因爲他把他的創口壓得太厲害了。這創口腫大成了一個瘤，而這瘤穿了，迸射出膿血把所有的人都汚辱了。他像平素一樣來回走着；兩眼直視着前面，指手劃脚地，在一種絕望的瘋癲中說着；他喉嚨裏充滿着嗚咽，一種對他自已的怨恨的反動；他像在告白着他的苦難一般，丨那種家人間的苦難；他像把他的痛苦抛在那飛躍着一些言辭的不聞不見的空氣裏似的。</p>
<p>哲安驚駭萬分，目差不多突然被他哥哥那種盲目的强力所說服，他緊靠着一張門站着，他猜到他們的母親在那張門後聽着他們。</p>
<p>她不能夠出來：她出來非經過客廳不行。而她没有回到客廳過；然則她是不敢進來了。</p>
<p>筆爾突然蹬着脚呌道：</p>
<p>「唉，我眞是豬啊，說出了這番話！」</p>
<p>於是他帽子也没戴便逃下樓去了。</p>
<p>通到街上去的那張大門砰碰的關上，那聲音把深深的沉在昏迷狀態裏的哲安震醒了。比幾點鐘還現得悠長的幾秒鐘過去了，而他的靈魂還没有脫去那種白　的愚昧之境。他狠覺到自已馬上便得考慮，便得有所作爲，可是他等候着，因爲害怕，柔弱，卑怯的緣故，他甚至不願懂得，不願明瞭，不願記起。他是屬於那種把無論什麽事都擱到明天再說的拖延的人一類的，當他非立刻採取一個决斷不行的時候，他也還是本能地在設法展緩一會兒。</p>
<p>可是經過筆爾的一番呌號之後，現在他周圍充滿着深沉的寂靜，這種從牆壁，傢具所反映出來的寂靜，加上十枝燭和兩盞燈的光亮，使得他突然恐怖到連他自己也想逃跑了。</p>
<p>於是他搖動他的思想，搖動他的心，他試着思慮起來。</p>
<p>他有生以來從没有遇到過什麽困難。他是那種隨遇而安，讓自已像水一般流着的人們之一。他在中小學的時候，曾經用心念書，那是爲着免得被罰：他在大學裏循規踏矩地學完了他的法律，那是因爲他的生活平靜。世界上的一切事物在他看來都狠自然，而没有引起他的别種注意。他腦子裏没有一點隱秘的處所，因爲性情的關係，他歡喜秩序和節操：因此他現在對着這慘禍，正像一個從没有游泳過的人落在水裏一樣。</p>
<p>他起始想加以懷疑。他哥哥因爲怨恨和嫉妒的緣故說了謊嗎？</p>
<p>可是假若他自己不曾絕望到了極點，他怎會下賤到說出這番汚辱他們母親的話呢？並且他的耳朶裏，他的眼睛裏，他們神經裏，甚至他的肉裏都保存着筆爾的一部分言詞，一部分痛苦的呌聲，一些和事實一樣不可抗的，不可非議的痛苦的語調和手勢。</p>
<p>他的精神完全清裂了，他簡直不能作一個動作或有一種意志。他困苦到了不能忍受的地步；而他覺到他的母親就在門背後，她什麽都聽到了，她在等待着。</p>
<p>她在幹什麽呢？没有一個動作，一個戰慄，一回呼吸，一聲歎氣，可以使人想到門板後面有着一個人在。她逃走了嗎？但從什麽地方逃走呢？假如她逃了……她雖道從窗戶裏跳到街上去了！</p>

<h3 id="c263">糖市　本廠綿白跌去角半 <a href="#c263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>昨日糖市以關金標金均見回小、趨勢復疲、公會劃盤二四粗砂白普通劃十九元七角、比前日小去七分、轉口貨小五分、劃六元八角半、二十號中砂白轉口貨Ｐ嘜劃六元七角、八九號荷赤轉口劃七元零五分至零七分、市勢頗硬、太古糖Ｂ嘜劃二十元二角、比前日小五分、振記綿白穩定多日、昨以粗砂白見跌關係、降去角半、一號爲十八元七角半、二號五角半、三號三角半、四號一角半、新潮青昨開二百餘包、均屬普通貨、價爲十三元八角至三四角、比前無上落、</p>

<p>四川榨菜、自漲價以來、曾因銷呆、稍見回鬆、但存底終屬不多、而來源亦無續到、故近市復趨堅挺、客貨開過三十一元、行盤高莊售三十二元、普通二十八九元、</p>

<p>素嗶嘰歲暮俱有生意、業中向稱爲繁銷品、素常顔色更爲暢銷、歷年來未見有減衰者、目下元色元常藍灰嗶嘰、趨勢步見下游、尤以三元左右檔子、更覺江河日下、雖明暗俱跌、銷塲尙極鈍滯、考其原緣、多半受日貨旺到之影響、兼之天時寒冷、嗶嘰質薄、買方均改選他種毛織物所致、昨公會上全市開出祇有三四十疋價比上週爲便宜、因離年底不遠、各號均欲脫貨而換財也</p>

<h3 id="c284">纏足談 <a href="#c284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>在民國將要進入二十三年的時候，還來談纏足，似乎有點失時；然而並不，這幾天報上關於「小脚」的功令，正層見疊頒。先有北平軍分會政治訓練處長劉健羣，以外人在張垣附近各鄕村，未經當地政府機關的允許，攝取我國舊或婦女纏足照片，作惡意宣傳，認爲「攸關國體」。因呈准國府，已由文官處通令全國各省主管政府，轉飭各地軍警機關，一體嚴密查禁。（見本月十一日上海某報）又有魯省府視察員李樹春，何思源，赴夏津，武城，高唐，博平一帶視察，因見經過各縣，婦女纏足之風仍盛，特電省府，請通令各縣，轉飭各機關職員，努力宣傳放足，並令學生佩帶「不與纏足女子結婚」的袖章云。（見本月十二日天津某報）「據此」，則「纏足談」之作，似乎還是很新頴的。</p>
<p>本來把一雙好端端的脚，纏成「三寸金蓮」的樣子，走起路來，搖搖擺擺，風吹欲倒的，這原是特種民族所特有的玩好，不足爲訓的。但看到這一班女子毁身傷體，以爲「悅已者容」的苦心，却又是一幅兩性間不平等的絕好圖畫。其所以造成這種不平等的原因，則在於經濟的背境。過去的女子！即現在也是如此！在經濟上，毫無地位可言，這是明顯的事實。本身對經濟旣無支配權，自然連自己也被操有經濟支配權的男子支配了去，這是必然的邏輯。於是她們惟一的任務，便是怎樣去爲悅已者容。於是從色情狂的詩人的集子裏去找題材，毁去了「蓮船」，造出了「金蓮」「新月」等樣子來給統治階級的男子們去作陶情贊歎的玩具。情形原是千分可悲的。這觀念在一部份人腦筋中，彷彿已成了彊石。</p>
<p>自從西洋文化的輸入，於是一般先覺的女子，也起來作男女平等的要求，「天足運動」，也曾風靡了一時。結果除了少數都市裏的婦女解放了之外，一般窮鄕僻壤的婦女！尤其是大江以北一帶！誠如魯省視察員所報告，「纏足之風仍盛。」但都市裏所謂解放了的婦女呢，則不過是由「三寸金蓮」改變而爲「三寸高跟」，走起路來，還是「搖搖擺擺」，「風吹欲倒」的。丨這情形與二十年來的政治改革倒有點相像！故表面上看來似乎是解放了，但不過是扭去了舊的鎖練，換上新的鐐銬罷了，實際上還是在「悅已者容這一信念之下生活着的。以美傲人，正是一般婦女的可憐處，顯示人以自已的弱點。故穿高跟鞋的摩登女子，正不必嘲笑纏足的同儕，事實上正同其命運，丨向男子統治的社會，度其乞憐的生活。關於這一點，魯省視察員的觀察是對的：令學生佩帶「不與纏足女子給婚」的袖章，我想這是有成效的。同樣的，倘頒一個「不得與穿高跟鞋之女子結婚」的命令，我想也可以使高跟鞋絕跡，丨至少要少些。女子的恐怖，不在於刑典，而在於與男子丨不如說經濟的好丨的意增　發生齟齬。但可悲的就在這裏。禁了纏足，改穿高跟鞋；倘禁了高跟鞋，還有新的足以取悅男子的把戲起來代替他。在未能切實改善女子在經濟上的地位以前，這是無法禁絕的，也無從談起「男女平等」的。</p>
<p>這又是「人」的問題了。</p>
<p>至於禁止外人攝取「小脚」照片，這原是家醜不可外揚的意思。但是内未禁絕先要禁外，也是不可能的。滿身的瘡疤，總有一二處袒露出來給人看的一天。「攸關國體」的，又豈止是「小脚」而已哉！</p>

<h3 id="c285">法國小說家「德歌派拉」陶醉中國女子 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>法國的奢侈繁華，是世界聞名的；所以它的首都巴黎，一名呌做「花都。」Ｆrower－Ｃity法國女子的奢華風充，也是世界聞名的；所以電影裏的肉感，押蕩，香艶影片，大多數描寫法國女人的事。我們貴國的留學生，往往喜歡討法國女人做老婆，因爲是陶醉伊們的昳蕩，熱戀伊們的漂亮，那裏喜歡討國貨的「黄臉婆」呢。</p>
<p>豈知事有不然，前幾天，法國小說家德歌派拉先生到北平來，他發表談話，對於我們中國女子，埀涎三尺，批評得眞可笑。新浪漫派作家潘君英女士，聽了表示反對，逐段批駁他，現在把它話記了出來：</p>
<p>德歌派拉道：「余對中國的特殊感想，就是中國的摩登女子，美不可言，穿的衣服，如同裹在身體上。粉臉是平平的。」</p>
<p>潘女士駁道：「其實，法國女子穿的衣服，是裹在身體上的。中國女子，素知禮敎，不能供不知禮敎的人，信口雌黄！」</p>
<p>德歌派拉道：「余理想中的目的人，是幽默而富有「東方美」的中國女子結婚，可以安慰一生。」</p>
<p>潘女士駁道：「此語更不成體統：法國青年談戀愛，中國青年亦談戀愛：豈有不談戀愛，即談結婚之理？」</p>
<p>德歌派拉道：「中國女子，以蘇州爲最美。余在南京夫子廟，聽中國歌曲，有一位蘇州歌女雪艶琴，她在舞臺上的婷婷姿態，我的心靈·被她迷住了幾天。」</p>
<p>潘女士駁道：「德氏游歷中國未久，便荒唐如此，竟認歌女雪艶琴爲蘇州女子的代表。試問德氏見過幾位蘇州女子，亦曾與高尙蘇州女子長談嗎？中國有智識的女子，深知女子係獨立的人；並非專知交際，不務正業，何以德氏不察，誣衊中國女子，譏笑中國女子，中國女子認爲德氏係一「文氓」吧了！」</p>
<p>哈！哈！聽了這位法國小說家德歌派拉先生的談話，不禁令我們笑落了齒牙。潘君英女士的駁斥，可謂幷剪哀梨，當頭棒喝，德歌派拉先生聽了，也可以曉得我們中國女子的「尊嚴」了。德先生說：「中國摩登女子，穿的衣服，如同裹在身體上。一其實，像你們貴國的女子，酥胸畢露，粉腿雙陳，曲綫之美，難以言喻。而屁股的藝術，尤其是我國女子，所不能學涉於萬一，貴國女子，眞是美不可言啊。的確，你們法國女子的鼻，是高高的；髮是黄黄的；眼珠也是黄的：你老人家以爲不是「美的元素一嗎？但，重輕是可以權，長短可以度，多少可以量，都是有一定的器具，一定的標準。只有「美」「醜」兩事，是没有測量器具的。雄狗見了雌狗，越看越可愛；黄牛見了黄牛，越看越美麗；物以類聚，何必瞧了我國女子平平的臉蛋兒，而使你老人家「色情狂」呢。</p>
<p>據說：「西方的標準美人，是高加索；東方的標凖美人，是蘇州。山明水秀，靈氣所鍾，這便是誕育美人的原因嗎？其實，也不盡然。中國的妓女，同分「蘇」「揚」兩帮，蘇爲上，揚爲下。其實蘇州並不是産生妓女的地方。蘇錫交界處，有名「蕩口」的，纔是妓女的特産地：天下人不要寃枉了蘇州人呀。揚帮妓女，因爲口音不及蘇州人的流利溫柔，所以貶了一等。其實，像昔日的西施·艶名千古，不是紹興人嗎？伊未必能操一口「吳儂軟語」呢。德歌派拉先生，見了蘇州歌女雪艶琴，迷住了心靈幾天，不知遇見了赤足畊田的蘇州女子，怎樣的神魂飄蕩咧？</p>
<h3 id="c286">死討好 <a href="#c286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>在中國·凡是一個人死了，他或她的親戚知已或朋友，隨他們和死者生前毫無任何感情可言，或根本不大來往的，總得會多少送些花圈或錫箔或香燭……等，因爲他們覺得這是必不可免的「禮節」，對於死者是否有益，那是另一個問題。</p>
<p>大槪人們都感到這些「禮物」太無意義了，因此有人倡起將這些無謂的「禮物」代以實質的金錢，以爲死者奬學的基金。並且事實上，這種方法已經相當地實行着。這，雖能使死者「名留後世」，然而對於死者自身是否有益，還是一個疑問，得實益的不過是那班清貧的學子而已。</p>
<p>那麽竟究怎樣才能使死者得到實際的利益呢？這是久欲解而不可解的問題（？）</p>
<p>可是咱們老大的中國人，畢竟不如「碧眼黄髮」的洋人，把這嚴重的問題（？）很不費力地解决了！不信且看十六日本報所載的世界社倫敦通訊：</p>
<p>「每日捷報載一奇廣告，署名者爲費爾他姆氏，其文云；「敬告一切我之友及我之敵，登此廣告者願君等於我死後贈我鮮花及花圈等之禮物者，提早的此際折算現錢見貺，蓋此比於死後以枯萎之花供養我者，實惠多多也。倘蒙厚賜，不論多寡，均將感激領受。寓斯脫倫特旅館費爾他姆。」</p>
<p>這是否這位洋大人的幽默，仰係悲哀，我們且不去管牠，然而我們不能不懷疑這種方案（？）有没有實行的可能？一般人對死者贈送那些無謂的「禮物」，還不過是爲那虛僞的禮節所驅使而已，而那位洋大人欲未死而取得現錢，這不免使人懷疑牠的實行的可能性。</p>
<p>那麽這嚴重的問題（？）將永遠没有解决的希望麽？</p>
<h3 id="c287">「老」話 <a href="#c287" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e287" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">287</a></h3>
<p>— 澤卿</p>
<p>一般人的心理，大槪都不肯「老」自居的。有時候問起他們的年齡，起碼總要瞞的三五歲或一二歲。尤其是女子們，簡直不肯把眞實的年齡告訴别人。俗語說。「年年十八歲」。這是很多着女子心理的，幷且人越老，心越花。你看春秋時的老萊子，到了七十歲還要穿着五彩衣，做孩子戲　這雖然爲了娛樂起見，後人稱道他爲孝子的模範。恰也是一個「人老心不老」的例子。又看社會上一般婦女，嬌揉造作所謂「徐娘半老，風韻猶存。」豈不是人老心花的證據嗎？</p>
<p>還有幾種徽號。一般人絕對不肯承受的。例如，稱貪吃的人曰：「老饕」。或「老饞」。稱没用的曰；「老朽」。稱昏憤的人曰：「老誖」。稱吝嗇的人曰「老慳」。稱年老神衰的人曰：「老邁」。「老物」！或「老槍」。稱迂腐的人曰「老頑固」。稱失德的人曰「老而不死」。他們若得到這樣徽號，非但不肯承受，還要拚命地向說的人辦交涉呢。</p>
<p>但是有幾種徽號，無論年老或未老的人，却個個歡喜的。例如：做敎師的人，稱他爲「老夫子」。「老師」。在地方有些名望的人，稱他爲」老先生」。「老丈」。他自已或兒孫做了官，爯他爲「老爺」。「老大人」，「老太爺」。「老封翁」稱他的「老婆」爲「老夫人」。「老太太」年得子的，稱他爲「老蚌珠」。年老有志的，稱他爲「老驜伏櫪」。高年有爲的，稱他爲「老少年」。深於閱歷的，稱他爲「老成練達」。「老馬識途」。熟悉辦事的，稱他爲「斵輪老手」。氣槪不凡的，稱他爲「老氣橫秋」。思慮周詳的，稱他爲「老謀深算」。誠篤眞摯的稱他爲「老實君子」。有時他自已高興起來，居然自稱爲「老夫」，「老漢」。「老手」。謙虛一點，便自稱爲「老拙」，「老朽」。婦人們大都自稱爲「老身」。但也有袒然自稱「老娘」的。和尙自稱爲「老衲」至於尼姑…自稱「老」什麽，我就不得而知了！</p>
<p>做壽的時候，無論三十，四十，五十，六十。……他自己的希望和别人對他的頌揚。總是越「老」越好。例如：祝男壽曰「南極」「老」人」。祝雙壽曰「齊眉偕老」。「白頭偕老」。一般大人先生們的心裏，不但越老越好，並且還希望迎老得快越好。所以年年要做壽。有的一年做一次壽還不算，竟要做上好幾回。可見這個「老」字，也有給人家極意歡越的時候呢！</p>
<p>此外，有大功的宿宦稱「元老」年高有德的稱「耆老」。舊僕稱「老家人」。老婦稱「老太婆」。多年陳酒曰「老酒」。稱表兄弟爲「老表」稱至交曰「老友」。稱平輩「老兄」。稱父執曰「老伯」。稱叔伯祖或年高的曰「老公公」稱店主曰「老閶」。稱同鄕爲「老鄕」。稱娼婦爲「老鴇」。上海土話裏。有「老舉」，「老蟹」，「老牌」，「老前輩」，「老資格」。「大好老」。「大老官」。……再有駡人用的「出老」。過癮用的「老土」。</p>
<p>以上所談的，不過是眼前想得到的。其餘的呢，我一時也「老」是想不出來。我們對人用「老」字的時候。須要斟酌出之。切不可「倚老賣老」「老年工架」。或者「老三老四」。否則很易容使人「老羞成怒向不你飽以「老拳」，還要問你！「老不老」呢！</p>

<h3 id="c289">大廉價 <a href="#c289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— 祖</p>
<p>各大公司，以及各小商店，一到春季就有「春季大廉價」，到了夏季就有「夏季大廉價」秋季同樣地有秋季大廉價，冬季那必然的也有「冬季大廉價」。除了這四季應時的大廉價外，還有所謂「聖誕大廉價」，「特别大廉價」。還有「關店大廉價」等等……這樣好像是非「「廉價」不能增加顧客來買他們的貨品似的。因之，這些公司以及小商店的「大廉價」，不能不使我起了極大的懷疑了；我想：因爲假使他們一年四季的「兼價」，要是眞的在價格方面能有减低的話，那末這些商店至多開了一年，就要關門大吉了呀！否則這就證明他們的所謂「廉價」又是騙人的烟幕了。</p>
<p>媽是最吹喜唸經的，她時常這樣的說：「假使我能有三藏彌陀經，二藏妙法蓮華經，二藏金剛經，那我死也瞑目了。可是要去買這些經，又非幾百元錢不興呀！有天一一個和尙到我家來說，他在「坐關」的時候唸有彌陀經四藏，妙法蓮華經三藏，金剛經三藏，現在因爲要造新寺，所以肯忍痛「廉價」屈售，本來金剛經要六十元一藏，妙法蓮華經要四十元，彌陀經買廿五元一藏，現在都「减價」十元出賣，媽聽了很快樂，就向他各買了幾藏。啊！六根清凈去修行的人也有「大廉價」的日子，那無怪大廉價之普遍了。</p>
<p>某日到一個學校裏去玩玩，看見告白處有一張通告，大意是這樣的：「下星期一起星期六止爲本校註册日期，若在規定日期内註册，則下學期可减去五分之一的學費；若過此期註册，則須照章納付應繳各費。如有同胞姊妹同來者，則學費可打九五折等」云云。這兒所謂「學校」裏也在「大廉價」了！</p>
<p>在我們的故鄕裏，有些人家把自已的女兒當做商品般的，若女兒稍有姿色，那他們眞的會以她是一筆財産了，所以在手飾方面，聘金方面，他們會拿出敲竹扛的手段去向「男家」要求的。但是一到了去年上海發生了戰事，說是鄕下也將波及，這樣他們因擔負不起携帶青年女子的重任，所以在遇着相當的人家時，他們就把自己的「財産」廉價出賣丨許配丨了。「大廉價」居然也輪到婚烟的份兒了。</p>
<p>這個年頭，在這個社會裏，「大廉價」的事情大槪不只這裏所記的一二椿吧，什麽事情都交了「大廉價」的命運：東西是這樣，性命該是這樣，地圖，國土亦是這樣！眞是不足希奇的。</p>
<h3 id="c290">關於「我的××」詞的非議 <a href="#c290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— 鏡心</p>
<p>近來常常看到凡是給孩子用的或吃的東西，都冠以「我的」二字以爲名字。如春店裏的「我的畫報」藥房裏的「我的藥片」等等均是，我看到這些特殊而又時行的名詞的時候，總會兜起一大陣懷疑：「這根據什麽理由？對於兒童是有益還是有害」？一天我將以我的懷疑，詢諸一個朋友，他以爲「那不過是會引起兒童的興趣，或注意起見，說不到益害關係」。這解答不能冰釋我的懷疑，我是覺得這問題雖小，而對於兒童的關係極大。</p>
<p>根據摩爾根的「古代社會」研究，以爲原始人與現在地球上尙存留的野蠻人的語言中，是没有「你」和「我」的存在，只有我們，你們，他們的存在。「我的」觀念的來由，是私有財産制發生以後的事。但一到將來的社會，人與人的關係，必加複雜而密切，團體是增多而占重要，人類的生活逐漸將由個人主義的生活範疇中脫離，擴大進爲集團的生活，社會的生活。「我的」「個人」這類的觀念在中世紀人類被宗敎封建君主等所魔醉所宰割的時代，確是能促進社會的新觀念，初期資本主義世界的繁榮，確是個人主義唯一的傑作。然而現在資本主義已發展到最後的形態，暴露了不可免避的矛盾；社會是恐慌，危機，不景氣，人口過剩，生産過剩等等百病叢生，同資本主義共興亡之個人主義，自然也像傍西山之日一般將終了他的使命。倘若這時候還有人來提倡個人主義（正像提倡封建軍閥），無不嘘之爲開倒車的舉動吧。換言之將「我的」「自已的」等等自私自利的觀念拚命的刻鐫在潔白的嫩弱的孩童的腦上，養成一個僅知有已而不知有人更不知有國家有社會的人，難道是現在或將來的社會所需要的嗎？反之我們應該灌灌兒童以社會，國家，勞動等觀念，造成將有益於社會有用於國家的生産者。</p>
<p>至於「我的」二字，能引起兒童的興趣和注意的話，也不是至理。以我們的平時的觀察，知道兒童的心理與原始人相像，是不分你我的澈底的社會主義者。兒童常常會把自家的東西，毫不顧忌的贈他的小朋友，也常會從别人家裏，取得他自以爲有用的東西而不以爲是偷竊的。我們應該好好地利用兒童這種可敬的根基，而加以適當的修正，如果我們看見孩子憚自攫取别人的東西時，如以偷竊的話來嚇他，不如以「不要隨便拿别人辛苦（勞動）所得的東西，而要自己的辛苦去創製東西，或換得東西」。的話來勸敎他，反會有效而易懂些。</p>
<p>總言之，現在或將來的社會，是决不需要如軍閥奸商之類的人來撇持，希望未來的時代的主人丨丨兒童，少沾染舊時代所遺下的個人主義的病菌。</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（三）（八）陰暗的黄昏</p>
<p>要攫取一個女子的心，是並不怎樣容易的事，但是要挽回一個女子的心是更難，敏姊决意要走，我已没有挽留她的能力。一個陰暗的黄昏，陰暗的情緒爬上各人陰暗的心邊，整個正誼社的空氣，比當初查封的時候更形嚴重。敏姊埋着頭自顧整理物件，對於各人的勸告都没有回答，無數對的眼睛隨着她的雙手上下左右移動，好像各人的命運都被那雙手主宰着。</p>
<p>風在屋頂吹過，室内能夠聽見每個人的呼吸。</p>
<p>「孫小姐」一個粗大的聲音突然打破這陰暗的空氣，小黄不知什麽時候捧了一個包站在門口說話：「依我自己的地位講，如其不能挽留孫小姐，我先離開這裏。」說話的時候再不像銀幕上那個嘻皮笑臉的胖子。</p>
<p>敏姊回顧頭來，每個人回顧頭來瞧着善演喜劇主角的悲劇。</p>
<p>敏姊目光從每個人臉上移過，她明白每個人逼切的情感，像被壓迫的人投降了一樣，把脚邊的盒子之類一陣亂踢，將自己重重地坐到床上，無可奈何的說：「我不走了，不走了。」</p>
<p>「敏眞的？」高飛說。</p>
<p>「你們還不信任我，我不那樣的人，我不會放冷箭，我不會暗算人！」</p>
<p>我知道她心中憤怒得什麽似的，我向高飛使了個眼色。</p>
<p>「敏，我信任你，你是我們社中的靈魂！」</p>
<p>孫小姐，我也信任你！小黄將手中的包投到門口地板上，舉起手來行了個軍禮。</p>
<p>「嗤：」敏姊笑了。</p>
<p>一付千斤的重擔在各人陰暗的心邊推過，在這陰暗的黄昏。</p>
<p>「下去罷，我不走了，待我休息一會。」敏姊身子向床上一倒。顯出十分乏力的樣子。</p>
<p>誰都没有一句話，悄悄的下三層樓。阿福在樓梯口探着頭，見我們下樓來，囁嚅的問：「高先生，要開飯嗎？」那態度好像他也擔着滿腹的心事。</p>
<p>「開來罷，肚子確餓了。」高飛隔衣服捧了捧肚子，長長的嘆一口氣。</p>
<p>小黄在法沙上一坐，始終没有表情。我過去拍拍他的肩頭說：一小黄，你救了我。」</p>
<p>「我救了你？」他張大了眼珠「還是我起的禍殃丨要是孫小姐今天一走，我不知要怎樣對不起你和正誼社。」</p>
<p>我嘆了一口氣，望着壁上的鐘，比平時吃飯時間遲了五刻鐘。</p>

<p>Outbreak Location 30 Li Southwest of Taicheng</p>
<p>Battles Also Commenced Between Pingyang and Fuding</p>
<p>Four Routes of Fujian Troops Invading Zhejiang, Central Army Determined to Counterattack</p>
<p>Navy Fleets Have Been Ordered to Mobilize Fully</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) Yesterday, three aircraft departed for inspection of Taishun, Pingyang, and other locations. It is reported that over 2,000 Fujian soldiers have indeed engaged with our forces on the border of Taishun and Shouning. The location of the outbreak of war is 30 li southwest of Taishun county. Warfare has also commenced between Pingyang and Fuding, and has not stopped to date. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Third Army Heading South Along Coast <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Confirmed news: The Third Army is heading south along the coast and has already moved out. Except for a portion left to guard Wenzhou, the remainder is being transported toward Fuzhou. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">Fujian Side Advancing with Skirmishes <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain military agency received a telegram from Hangzhou stating that the Fujian side is avoiding strength and attacking weakness, advancing towards southern Zhejiang with skirmishes. In recent days, vanguard battles have occurred around Taishun and Qingyuan. A certain unit of the National Army concentrated in eastern Zhejiang is mobilizing. The Hangzhou Air Force is preparing for bombing operations as soon as Chiang's order is received. Currently, they are only flying to the front to scout military intelligence daily. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e7">Bandits on the Border of Tai and Qing Have Been Repelled <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Red bandits on the border of Taishun and Qingyuan have currently been repelled to locations such as Kengdi and Xixi in Shouning jurisdiction. However, the bandits are receiving supplies from the Fujian side and are still actively planning to counterattack Zhejiang, making the situation quite critical. However, the Zhejiang Border Security Regiment is brave and skilled in battle, and is more than capable of dealing with the Red bandits. Local defenses are extremely consolidated. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e8">Fujian Joins Red Bandits to Invade Zhejiang via Four Routes <a href="#e8" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c8" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">8</a></h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) A certain authority told reporters today that after Fujian decided to invade Zhejiang, the harassment has been increasingly urgent in recent days. According to reports, Fujian has joined forces with Red bandits, dividing into four routes to invade Zhejiang: (1) attacking Pingyang from Xiapu and Fuding; (2) attempting to seize Taishun, Qingyuan, and Jingning via Zhenghe and Shouning; (3) attacking Xianxia Pass by attacking Pucheng; (4) instigating Jiangxi bandits to infiltrate the Zhejiang border, attempting to cut off the liaison of the Central Army within Xianxia Pass. However, our army was aware of the enemy's plan early and has taken strict precautions, so there is no cause for concern locally. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Fujian side is invading Zhejiang in three routes. The left route concentrates the main force of the 19th Route Army near Yanping and Jian'ou Jianyang, threatening Liu Heding and his troops. It is heard that our side has temporarily abandoned [illegible], while deploying elite Central Army units [illegible] and other divisions, gathering around Pucheng. If Fujian continues to press on, a full effort will be made to annihilate the rebel army in one fell swoop. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) Announcement: Fujian rebels use bandits as two parts and rebel army as one part to mainly defend against Guangdong; they use bandits and rebels in equal parts to mainly attack Zhejiang. Bandits invade from eastern Jiangxi, rebels come out of northern Fujian. The Central government has made arrangements and will punish them severely. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e9">Enemy Aircraft Reconnoitering National Army Positions <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Hangzhou) Today, enemy aircraft flew again to Pingyang, Taishun, and other counties under Wenzhou jurisdiction to reconnoiter our army positions. Just as the Aviation Administration dispatched several aircraft to fly to the border, the enemy aircraft, seeing the situation and fearing being attacked, fled in disarray. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hangzhou) The Fujian military airfield is originally located in Fuzhou, Quanzhou, Longyan, and Jiangzhou. Now, in order to actively attack Zhejiang, airfields are being hurriedly built in Yanping and Gutian, which will be completed soon. (22nd Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e10">Chen Shaokuan Talks About Navy Mobilization <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Chen Shaokuan returned to Nanjing after visiting Chiang in Jiangxi. According to his talk, he visited Chairman Chiang in Fuzhou specifically to discuss naval deployment against Fujian, and received instructions on strategy. (1) Deployment is complete. A general attack will be ordered within days. The army, navy, and air force will advance simultaneously, hoping for a complete victory. He also said that the Fujian rebel army's cadres and troops only consist of the mixed 19th Route Army, and the strength is not large and not enough for one blow. He personally judged that the rebel army can disintegrate or surrender to the central government in the shortest period of time. Chen, Li and others must end up in disgrace. The navy fleets have already begun full mobilization, deploying defenses at the mouth of Fujian, cutting off the rebel's supplies. Regardless of Chinese or foreign ships, they must be strictly inspected by our navy before being allowed to pass. Once the central government's general attack order is issued, water traffic will be cut off immediately. Currently, the Min River area is commanded by Wang Shouting, commander of the torpedo fleet, and Chen Xunyong, commander of the training fleet, is waiting for orders in Wusong. If necessary, I will personally depart, and if I have no time to leave, I must also select a vice minister to go. A certain newspaper in Beijing reported the day before yesterday how Xiamen changed, which is purely intentional propaganda by the rebels. To this day, the navy is still working normally in Xiamen, and I receive daily telegrams from Chen Wenlin, director of the Xiamen Aviation Office, saying that it is peaceful as usual. Although the office is not far from the puppet government, the rebels dare not attack it. Today's news says that the strategy has been changed to attack Wenzhou first, which is Chen, Li, and others' illusion. Wenzhou is a major trading port, and the ports under Wenzhou jurisdiction are also very important. The navy usually pays attention to it, and now warships are densely deployed along the coast of Wenzhou, and the guards are strict, so it is difficult to succeed. Moreover, the land defense in the Wenzhou area is also very consolidated. Chen said that Chen Mingshu, Cai Tingkai, and Li Jishen are using the name of revolution to practice communism, but they are not really inclined to communism. They are actually plundering the people's wealth to enrich their own pockets. The people of Fujian were slightly stable at first because their policies were unclear, but recently they have seen their true colors exposed and are fleeing in fear. Also, the houses of good people with private property in Fujian Province have been plundered, and the private residences of Central Committee member Yang Shuzhuang and others have also been affected. Because Fujian Province's finances are in dire straits, the central and southwestern subsidies have all been suspended, so they specialize in plundering people's wealth by force to make military pay.

<p>(Hangzhou) After the Red bandits in eastern Jiangxi were severely suppressed by the Central Army, a part fled to Guangfeng and Shangrao. Recently, they have received supplies from the Fujian rebels and have a model of peeking into Zhejiang at Erdu Pass. The National Army's forces in the area are very strong, and the bandits have no way to make progress. The defenses in the Jiang and Chang area of the Zhejiang border are strict, and the local area is safe. (22nd Dispatch)</p>

Over 2,000 bandits are concentrated in Shouning and Fu'an, half of whom have guns. Also, more than 1,000 bandits have gathered in Muhang, Fu'an, and all have a model of peeking into Zhejiang.

<p>(Beiping) Although the Japanese side has repeatedly stated that the Japanese army has not crossed the Rehe-Chahar border and has withdrawn, the Chinese newspapers here still firmly believe that the Japanese army actually wants to control the eastern Chahar border and has no intention of withdrawing. The Japanese army's extension of its influence into Chahar Province is a prelude to war with Soviet Russia. Therefore, the Japanese army, regardless of the opposition of the Mongolian princes, is building a radio station in northeastern Chahar, and Japanese military officers are also actively operating in the border area.

<h3 id="e27">A Glimmer of Hope in the European Political Situation <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Shēn</p>
<p>After Germany withdrew from the disarmament conference, the whole of Europe, while not necessarily tense, has become increasingly mired in an international stalemate. Germany insists on military equality and has recently implemented a reorganization of its national defense forces, with numbers exceeding the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles by more than one and a half times. This is sufficient to prove that Germany is determined not to be a naked body surrounded by strong neighbors. France and its satellite Central European countries are doing everything possible to maintain the Treaty of Versailles. France is particularly insistent on security guarantees. Thus, the confrontational situation between France and Germany is becoming more apparent, and the crisis in international politics is accumulating more and more. Italy, in this situation, is using its pivotal position to ally with the Soviet Union, which is feared by capitalist countries, and to join forces with Germany, which is feeling frustrated, to expand its hegemony and exert its fascist influence. Since the proposal to reform the League of Nations was made, Italy's international standing has become increasingly prominent. However, this move is opposed by France, and the United Kingdom also finds it difficult to agree. The Central European countries, which are aligned with France, also oppose Italy's plan to reform the League of Nations, which disregards small countries. Therefore, the talk of reorganizing the League of Nations will ultimately be just a pipe dream. Moreover, the United States and the Soviet Union each have their own unique positions. The United States maintains its traditional Monroe Doctrine in the Americas, planning to establish an economic alliance in the Americas, and only seeks commercial expansion in other countries of the world. In any case, it is unwilling to easily become involved in the disputes of European politics. As for the Soviet Union, it has recently been making every effort to maintain its so-called international peace diplomacy, not easily provoking capitalist countries. It takes a purely bystander attitude towards the disputes in Western Europe and will never casually participate. Therefore, the League of Nations reform plan promoted by Italy is bound to be shelved for a long time.</p>
<p>Germany is still maintaining its tough stance. On the one hand, it knows very well that France cannot interfere in Germany's internal affairs by military force. On the other hand, it uses this to stimulate the German people and make them forget the pain of the current economic panic. As a result, the proposal from the British side to conclude a non-aggression treaty among the countries bordering Germany has caused a great stir. British Foreign Secretary Simon's visit to Europe is closely related to this. It is believed that the United Kingdom's intention in advocating this is to ease Germany's radical demands, at least to allow Germany to further increase its national defense forces, and also to provide France with some new guarantees for its so-called security. Although this kind of treaty may not be truly effective in practice, it may offer a slight turning point in the current rigid situation. France now admits that it can increase its militia to 200,000, instead of the proposed 300,000 for Germany. The four-year trial supervision period under international management can also be shortened to two years. Germany may not immediately agree to this, but it has opened the door for negotiation. The conflict between France and Germany should not be as sharp as before, and there is a greater possibility of temporary reconciliation.</p>
<p>However, there is still a very concerning problem at present. Although the matter is small, its actual nature may not necessarily cause danger. However, disasters often come unexpectedly. What is this matter? It is that Germany has begun to reorganize its foreign debt and announced a reduction in cash payments for foreign debt interest. The Deutsche Bank has recently announced the payment method for debt due in the first half of 1934. It only allows for 30% of the debt to be allocated. The only excuse it uses is that Germany's export trade has declined, falling to 1.8 billion marks less than in 1931. After suffering this loss, Germany finds it difficult to repay its debts. Creditor countries such as the United Kingdom believe that Germany's debt reliance is not justified. They also point out that the Deutsche Bank's reserves have increased to 20 million pounds in recent months, and the trade balance has continued to improve. There is no reason to reduce debt interest at this time. Under the capitalist system, ownership is sacred and absolutely inviolable. The idea is that all laws and the organization of society in general are based on consolidating ownership and preventing people from infringing upon it. The same is true between countries and nations. However, since the war debt problem arose, one aspect of observation is the opposing relationship between European countries and the United States of America. In fact, financial freezes are common within Europe and South America. Although this belongs to the scope of economic panic, the erosion of the sanctity of debt has become an undeniable fact. The impact of national debt reliance will inevitably expand from a small scope to various regions. At a time when the world is trapped in the frenzy of economic panic, judging by the total trade volume of 60 countries in the world this October, the total average import value has decreased by 64% compared to the monthly average in 1929, and the total export value has decreased by 63%. It is difficult to see hope for improvement in the short term. Can we guarantee that this complex and intricate international situation will not lead to political disputes due to debt relations? The so-called relaxation is only a short-term relaxation.</p>

<p>Government Decides to Prosecute Under Public Safety Act</p>
<p>Dublin - General O'Duffy, leader of the Blue Shirts, was detained for several days. His lawyer was in the process of arranging bail for his attendance when summoned, but today, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court ordered the warden to immediately release O'Duffy and his comrade Sullivan, stating that the two had not committed other crimes and were only detained for wearing blue shirts and attempting to speak to the crowd, which was illegal. The public was greatly surprised. Speculation is now rife regarding the government's next steps. It is rumored that the government intends to transfer O'Duffy and Sullivan to a military court and charge them with suspicion of participating in an illegal organization. However, the government's legal officers will carefully consider this. If the government decides to prosecute under the provisions of the Public Safety Act, then O'Duffy and Sullivan may be re-arrested. When O'Duffy and Sullivan were released from Arbour Hill Military Prison today, former cabinet member Bride's and hundreds of Blue Shirt members cheered them, lifted them onto their shoulders, and put them in a car, which drove to Dublin. General O'Duffy then consulted with Cosgrave Leif. O'Duffy said that he felt extremely energetic and intended to continue fighting until he succeeded. (Reuters dispatch from the 21st)</p>

<p>Commerce Completely Halted</p>
<p>Havana - Political disturbances have resumed in Havana today, and commerce has been halted. Almost all stores have actually closed. The secretary of President San Martin and the Minister of Public Works have resigned. Successors have not yet been announced. There were three train accidents, resulting in a total of two deaths. Bombings are ceaseless. A nationwide reign of terror is brewing. When President San Martin attempted to speak to 1,500 young students, jeers arose. They attempted to storm the presidential palace, demanding the resignation of Army Chief Batista because the body of a disrobed student was found outside the barracks. The opposition is now demanding the president's resignation, a complete reorganization of the army, and the expulsion of Batista from the country, or else his demotion to sergeant. The Cuban government is deeply concerned about the expansion of the revolutionary tide. President San Martin has attempted to compromise with the opposition several times but finds their demands too harsh. Today, military preparations have been made. Security has been increased in front of the presidential palace, and sandbags and wooden fences have been set up. Troops and police have been stationed at major thoroughfares outside the capital to monitor cars entering the capital. In addition, searches for weapons are being conducted throughout the capital.

<h3 id="e61">Roosevelt Approves Silver Agreement World Silver Prices Stabilize <a href="#e61" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c61" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">61</a></h3>
<p>Promulgates Proclamation to Mint Silver Coins</p>
<p>Far East Trade Can Increase Greatly</p>
<p>London Observers Not Optimistic</p>
<p>(Washington) The US President today approved the London Silver Agreement concluded at the World Economic Conference this autumn, and approved people to send newly mined silver to mint silver coins.</p>
<p>According to the Silver Agreement, the US government will purchase 24 million ounces of domestically mined silver annually at a price of 64.5 cents per ounce over the next four years. It is generally believed that the President's approval is aimed at stabilizing the government's silver plan, hoping to gain the support of silver-state congressmen for the government's monetary policy, divide the forces of inflationists, and avoid an inflationary currency war in Congress.</p>
<p>Regarding the minting of silver coins, the President's proclamation stated that, in accordance with the Congressional bill, silver mined in the country and its territories may be sent to the mint for minting silver coins. However, half of the silver sent to the mint must be turned over to the government, collected by the national treasury, and used as seigniorage and handling fees. The remaining half, after being minted into silver coins, will be returned to the original owner. It also stated that, in order to help stabilize domestic prices and protect foreign trade from the adverse effects of foreign currency devaluation, it is now necessary to raise and stabilize silver prices.</p>
<p>The amount of silver that the US government intends to purchase annually is roughly equal to the total amount of silver mined domestically last year, and its value is half of the legal price in the mint. Therefore, those who want to send silver for minting silver coins must turn over half to the government.</p>
<p>It is now believed that the President's move will appease the appeals of silver-producing states, dispose of the surplus silver on the market, and at the same time enhance the economic position of the United States in the Far East. Senator Pittman, who was the initiator of negotiating the Silver Agreement at the London Conference, was very pleased to hear the news of the approval today, saying that the agreement is expected to raise world silver prices and increase the purchasing power of the Far East by 50%.</p>
<p>According to the Silver Agreement, India, China, and Spain, as the largest silver-holding countries, guarantee not to dump large amounts of silver abroad within four years. The United States, Mexico, Peru, Australia, and Canada, as the largest silver-producing countries, have agreed to limit production and purchase a portion of their production for minting coins or currency reserves. It is also stipulated that if this agreement has not been fully approved by April 1 of next year, silver-holding countries may no longer be bound, while silver-producing countries will still be bound. (National News Agency dispatch from the 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e62">Roosevelt's Proclamation <a href="#e62" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c62" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">62</a></h3>
<p>Pursuant to the May Congressional Act</p>
<p>President has the Power to Mint Gold and Silver Coins</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt's proclamation regarding the minting of silver coins; the original text is as follows:</p>
<p>Whereas, Section 2 of Chapter 43 of the Congressional Act passed on May 12, 1933, authorizes the President to prescribe the weight of gold coins that are nine-tenths fine and the weight of silver coins that are nine-tenths fine, in such quantities as the President, after investigation, deems necessary to stabilize domestic commodity prices or protect the currency; the President has the authority to mint an unlimited amount of gold and silver coins at the determined ratio;</p>
<p>And whereas, based on my investigation, I believe that in assisting the stabilization of domestic prices and in adhering to the policies and procedures currently implemented and approved by Congress, it is necessary to raise and stabilize the price of silver in order to protect our foreign trade from the adverse effects of debased foreign currencies;</p>
<p>And whereas, the resolution proposed by the U.S. delegation was adopted by the representatives of sixty-six nations at the World Economic Conference on July 27, 1933, stipulating that each government abandon the policy and practice of melting or reducing silver coins, stipulating that low-value silver certificates should be replaced with silver coins, and stipulating that no legislation should be enacted that could depress the price of silver;</p>
<p>And whereas, the supplementary agreements concluded between the silver-using countries of China, India, Spain, and the silver-producing countries of Australia, Canada, Mexico, Peru, and the United States, state that China agrees not to melt or reduce silver coins for the purpose of selling its silver, India agrees not to sell more than 35 million ounces of its silver annually for four years starting from January 1, 1934, and Spain also agrees not to sell more than 5 million ounces of its silver annually during the same period; India and Spain also agree to abide by the resolutions passed by the World Economic Conference thereafter;</p>
<p>Considering the aforementioned restrictions, the governments of the five silver-producing countries agree to purchase a certain amount of silver from their respective domestic mines; the amount of silver purchased by the silver-producing countries shall be 35 million ounces annually, for a period of four years starting from January 1, 1934; the silver thus acquired shall be retained by the four countries for four years for the purpose of minting coins or as currency reserves, and shall not be sold on the market within the four years; and it is understood that the United States, within this total amount of 35 million ounces, will annually purchase at least 24,421,410 ounces of silver produced in its own country for a period of four years;</p>
<p>Now, therefore, feeling that cooperation with other governments is appropriate, and that raising and stabilizing domestic prices, increasing the purchasing power of the people of silver-using countries, protecting our foreign commerce from the adverse effects of debased foreign currencies, and implementing the understanding reached among the sixty-six nations in the aforementioned resolution are also necessary, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Act of Congress and other legislation aimed at national recovery, and by virtue of other powers vested in the President, do hereby proclaim and direct the mints of the United States to receive silver bullion for the purpose of minting standard silver dollars, provided that the mint shall, in accordance with regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury, ascertain that the silver so received is derived from mines in the United States or its territories from the date of this proclamation;</p>
<p>The director of the mint, with the voluntary consent of the original owner, shall deduct fifty percent of the silver received as seigniorage and for the costs to the U.S. government of minting and transporting the silver coins; the remaining fifty percent shall be minted into standard silver dollars and delivered in full to the original owner;</p>
<p>The fifty percent of silver retained shall be held by the Treasury Department and shall not be sold before the end of December 1937, except for the purpose of minting United States silver coins;</p>
<p>The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized to formulate regulations to implement this proclamation; such regulations shall contain the terms and conditions previously established under the Act of Congress of April 23, known as the Pittman Act, with such modifications as may be necessary to determine the method of verifying that the silver originates from mines in the United States or its territories after the date of this proclamation;</p>
<p>This proclamation shall remain in effect until December 31, 1937, unless repealed or amended by an Act of Congress or by a subsequent proclamation. (Reuter's dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<h3 id="e64">Promoting Recovery Plan <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Pittman Expresses Delight</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Pittman believes that President Roosevelt's proclamation can greatly increase U.S. export trade and promote the stabilization of the world silver price at 64.5 cents per ounce. Pittman is very pleased and is confident that Canada, Australia, Mexico, and Peru will take similar actions. With the increase in the price of silver, the exchange rates and purchasing power of these countries will also increase accordingly. From then on, commodity prices can rise, and the recovery and restoration of normalcy in the United States can be accelerated. (Reuter's dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<p>(Washington) After President Roosevelt held a cabinet meeting and consulted with Morgenthau and Cummings, he issued a proclamation on the minting of silver coins, referring to the Thomas Amendment authorizing the President to change the gold and silver content of the dollar, and stated that after his own investigation, he felt that it was necessary to raise and stabilize the price of silver in order to raise and stabilize domestic commodity prices, increase the purchasing power of silver-using countries, and protect American foreign trade from the adverse effects of the devaluation of foreign currencies. This proclamation will be effective until the end of 1937 unless repealed or amended in the future. The President also mentioned India's ratification of the London Silver Agreement and said that he was aware that other countries would take similar actions, and he believed that complying with this agreement would stabilize the price of silver and subject it to the laws of supply and demand. (Reuter's dispatch on the 21st)</p>
<h3 id="e65">Global Impact <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>London's Observation Is Not Optimistic</p>
<p>(London) London, New York, and Bombay all expect that President Roosevelt's actions may not have much impact on the world silver price. According to news from Bombay, there is replenishment of short positions, but the general market conditions there are now awaiting London's attitude. Wall Street in New York has doubts about the impact on world trade, believing that China wants cheap silver in order to revitalize its export trade. If the price of silver soars, China, with its large silver reserves, will inevitably sell it, which will depress the London silver price. London financial circles say that the United States' purchase of gold has not been able to control world prices, so this time the U.S. silver policy may encounter the same fate. When the silver-using and silver-producing countries announced their agreement to restrict the sale of silver at the World Economic Conference, the price of silver only rose slightly, but soon rebounded, so the situation in the future should be the same. It is found that American speculators have about 150 million ounces of silver in stock, eager to sell it off. Although last year's silver production was only 160 million ounces, a decrease of 80 million ounces compared to the average of the past ten years, the world's accumulated silver reserves are still very large. Public opinion generally believes that only the recovery of world trade can permanently raise the price of silver, and the first key to achieving this goal is for China, the largest silver-using country, to solve its problems of exorbitant taxes, warlords, and redundant troops.

<p>(London) Major brokers here expect the price of silver to rise by 0.25 to 0.5 pence today. Although President Roosevelt's silver decision has caused a reaction in the market here, the public is not optimistic about the effectiveness of stabilization in the near future. It is generally recognized that speculative demand will soon arise, but the current situation is very unstable, fearing that China's silver reserves will be sold off due to high prices. Moreover, the United States' silver production only accounts for one-sixth of the world's total production. The amount of silver that India is allowed to export is set at 35 million ounces, which is far more than its recent total exports. Therefore, the public expects that the impact of President Roosevelt's decision will not be very significant or lasting. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>

<p>Havana The Cuban government is now considering minting an additional 20 million silver pesos to be stored in the national treasury as reserves for issuing silver certificates to alleviate financial difficulties. It is reported that Finance Minister Despaigne is in favor of this measure and has drafted an order for President San Martín to consider. If San Martín agrees, he will sign it into effect. It is rumored that a Cuban bank can lend funds to purchase silver and mint coins. It is said that the government can issue silver certificates to cover the most urgent government expenses and debts. In the future, Cuban taxpayers will be able to pay 70% of their taxes in silver certificates. If this plan becomes a reality, there will be a total of 38 million silver pesos in Cuba.

<p>British Policy Remains Ambiguous</p>
<p>Mediator Position Makes It Difficult</p>
<p>(Paris) Anglo-French disarmament talks began this morning at the Foreign Ministry, but the critical moment will be in the afternoon, as British Foreign Secretary Simon, British Ambassador Tyrrell, French Premier Chautemps, and French Foreign Minister Bonnet will all be present in the afternoon. According to the opinion of French observers, the only possible result is the clarification of French policy. As for British policy, it will remain ambiguous, as Britain's position as a mediator is indeed very difficult. (Reuter's dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Simon Announces British Policy to the House of Commons <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>Multilateral Convention Better Than Unilateral Declaration</p>
<p>League of Nations Should Not Be Allowed to Collapse</p>
<p>(London) Today, Foreign Secretary Simon attended the House of Commons to report on the major trends in international diplomacy. The main points were German Chancellor Hitler's recent proposal to sign non-aggression treaties with neighboring countries, and Britain's efforts to facilitate an agreement between Germany and France. Simon first stated that negotiations parallel and auxiliary to the Disarmament Conference are already underway in various European capitals, so the disarmament issue has not stopped for a moment. He then said that Hitler has repeatedly issued declarations in favor of cooperation between Germany and France, and that the British government has always been extremely concerned about this matter, but at the same time has made it clear that its position is that of an investigator and is not affiliated with any recommendations. Furthermore, the British government has also solemnly stated that it has not shunned the various obligations borne by members of the League of Nations, and that the non-aggression treaty now proposed should also be bounded by these obligations. Simon then described the purpose of his upcoming travels abroad, saying that he would take the opportunity to discuss Germany's proposal with French Foreign Minister Bonnet, as close cooperation between Germany and France is the most important issue today. According to Simon's opinion, he believes that a common agreement between international organizations is better than mutual treaties between two countries, and the League of Nations should not be allowed to collapse but should be allowed to progress slowly. He does not have extreme expectations for the future, but he feels that there is now a widespread exchange of views between governments, so he believes that when the first meeting is convened after Christmas, countries will definitely have a more definitive decision on British policy. At present, because Germany has already agreed to accept the joint management of armaments, with the condition that the armaments of other countries must be subject to the same joint management, the greatest goal in the future will be to make Japan and other countries accept the same conditions. Therefore, in Simon's personal opinion, the final result of this negotiation must not be satisfied with a declaration by one party alone, but must have a convention, signed jointly by all countries, in order to have a great effect.

<p>Italian Influence Extends Eastward</p>
<p>Will Conflict Head-on with Japanese Policy</p>
<p>Rome At the opening ceremony of the Asian Students' Congress here this morning, there was a surge of support for the connection between Italy and the East. The opening ceremony of the Congress was held in the Hall of Mars, the Caesar Augustus Hall in Rome. The venue was decorated with flags and ribbons, and 600 Asian students attended, of whom about 500 were students at major European universities, and about 100 were students at Italian universities. There were many teachers and religious students, as well as Eastern students wearing headscarves, and female students wearing national costumes, which attracted particular attention. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, accompanied by Fascist Party Secretary Starace and Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich, arrived at 11:45 a.m. As he entered the venue, the crowd cheered. Minister of Education Ercole, Director of the Oriental Institute and former Minister of Education Santi, Professor Mabbikate, and Count Ciano, Director of the Information Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and former Minister to China, greeted him at the door. Mussolini then took the stage to deliver a speech, first in Italian and then in English, saying in essence that the ancient Roman Empire, based on the Mediterranean coast, united the East and the West, which was of utmost importance in world history. At that time, Western countries and Syria, Egypt, and Persia were all colonies of the Roman Empire. Rome and these countries knew each other and benefited greatly. This kind of East-West unity is the foundation of our entire history. Today's European civilization originated from this. Now, if we want to avoid extinction, we must make it universal throughout the world. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<p>Rome For some time, Far Eastern affairs have occupied a particularly important position in Italian newspapers. The "Middle East and Far East Institute" was established today, and the Asian University Students' Association took the opportunity to hold a gathering. The public regards this as the most important event, and all believe that this is enough to represent the revival of "ancient Rome and Italy and Latin." The Fascist University Student Group issued a declaration to the Asian students, stating that "Rome is a city that will last forever, and its history is full of glory. Today, the reason for hosting Asian representatives is to complete a new mission, which is to unite the world as one family, and not just confine it to one corner of Europe." The fact that Rome is hosting Asian university students is especially meaningful at a time when Italian newspapers continue to oppose Japanese imperialism. Italian newspapers do not hide their fear of Japanese business policies. "Il Popolo d'Italia" stated that Japan's dumping policies in Australia, India, Africa, and Europe are indeed a very serious sign. When the newspaper published this kind of opinion, the Chinese military observation delegation, led by Yang Jie, President of the Army University, was traveling in various parts of Italy and visiting the demonstrations of assault vehicles and trailers. It is said that in the early spring of this year, chemical factories in northern Italy, especially in Milan, which have equipment for manufacturing explosives and suffocating gases, purchased a large number of raw materials and stepped up their work. It is currently rumored that this manufacturing is for a certain country in the Far East. (Havas dispatch on the 21st)</p>

<p>Countries Worldwide Inclined to Abolish Parliaments</p>
<p>Warsaw Today, the Polish Parliament discussed the new constitution and cited Sun Yat-sen's famous saying that all citizens can be trained to be good citizens, but only a few can exercise governing power, as proof that in the future, the election of senators will be determined only by work performance, and the universal suffrage system will be abolished. At the same time, efforts will be made to prevent the parliament from becoming a purely debating body, because the parliament has members from 35 different political parties, and debates will inevitably be disorderly. Moreover, some political parties lack a solid foundation. In order to promote the improvement of Polish politics, the political tutelage method planned by Sun Yat-sen will be adopted. Other democratic countries also have the same tendency, because many inexperienced democratic groups can only cause factional disputes and hinder the development of government affairs when handling national affairs. Austria decided to exercise supervisory power over the parliament in September last year. The power of the Italian House of Representatives has long been stripped away, and it will soon be dissolved and replaced by the Fascist Grand Council and the National Professional Associations. However, in the recent elections in Spain, 44 political parties competed, and there were 7,000 candidates. Romania had 4,000 candidates, representing 22 political parties. It is still difficult to predict the outcome of Spain and Romania, but it is rumored that there is a movement in Romania against the parliament, believing that the parliament is enough to hinder the king's intention to represent the people's will. Therefore, at present, the rulers of various countries, such as Japan, believe that they can represent the people and that the corruption of the parliamentary system is enough to hinder the true spirit of democracy.

<p>(Tokyo) In order to introduce Japanese culture overseas, Foreign Minister Hirota planned to establish an International Cultural Bureau, but its budget failed to pass the budget cabinet meeting. The Foreign Minister then discussed with representatives from the private sector to establish a cultural organization to replace the Cultural Bureau. As a result, a joint government-private international cultural promotion initiators' meeting was convened on the afternoon of the 21st. From the private sector, well-known figures such as Tokugawa Yorisada, Count Kabayama, Count Kuroda, Viscount Okabe, Baron Gō Seinosuke, Baron Ōkura, Kushida, Fukui, Kodama, and Asaki attended. First, the Foreign Minister explained the purpose of establishing the Cultural Promotion Association and sought everyone's approval for this move. Baron Gō Seinosuke represented everyone in expressing their strong support. After discussion, it was decided that the Foreign Minister would appoint a special committee to carry out preparations. Of the budget of one million yen, 200,000 yen would be paid by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the rest would be raised through donations from various sources.

Those arrested include Russians, French, Romanians, Americans, Canadians, and Yugoslavians. It is reported that these people are dedicated to serving Soviet Russia, but they also spy for the governments of several other countries.

Martin, who is fluent in several languages, was bribed along with a Russian named Steele by a certain country to undertake the task of reorganizing espionage affairs in Finland. Two other female spies, Sulle and Van Lan, cooperated with him. The other spies are responsible for investigating the military organization of France in the East and Southeast.

<p>Pingfang Says Reports of Japanese Troops Returning to Rehe Are Inaccurate</p>
<p>Chahar Provincial Government Orders All Troops to Maintain Strict Vigilance</p>
<p>Zhangjiakou Correspondence The westward invasion of Rehe by Japanese and puppet troops and the tension in eastern Chahar, as well as Tang Yulin's return to the Chahar Provincial Government, have all been noticed by the people of the country. The situation is described below:</p>
<h3 id="e81">The Situation in Eastern Chahar Remains Tense <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Approximately three to four thousand Japanese and puppet troops are stationed in the Rehe-Fengning area, equipped with several cannons and airplanes. On the 11th and 12th of the month, a unit of over a thousand troops, under the guise of suppressing bandits, suddenly advanced westward, reaching Xinyuan County on the Chahar border. Xinyuan County was originally the second and fourth districts of Guyuan, but due to its distance from the county seat, a separate county government was established at Xifengzhai. On the morning of the 13th, the Japanese and puppet troops arrived near Xifengzhai and immediately engaged with the garrison forces of the county, led by Ma Jinliang and Huang Shouzhong. These two units were originally mixed troops, lacking training, and the suddenness of the attack caused them considerable losses. They retreated slightly. Zhang Shusheng, the special commissioner of Xinyuan, then led his team to Longmensuo to set up defenses. After entering Xifengzhai, the Japanese and puppet troops then advanced to Sunjiaying, twelve li from Longmensuo, but did not continue to advance. They posted notices along the way, claiming that the advance was to suppress bandits, and also urged the people to repair roads. On the 16th and 17th, news came from the front that most of the Japanese and puppet troops had withdrawn, but in fact, the Japanese and puppet troops did not move backward, and the situation remained tense. On the 20th, the provincial government received a report and instructed all units in eastern Chahar to pay close attention to defense and to reorganize defenses to prevent oversights. In addition to Guyuan, which is still defended by Zhang Yunrong, the troops of Liu Guitang in Chicheng will be temporarily transferred to □□, and other strong troops will be sent to take over the defense. Song Zheyuan also plans to personally inspect eastern Chahar. According to a responsible person in Chahar Province, who spoke to reporters on the 19th, the Japanese and puppet troops' westward invasion, though under the guise of suppressing bandits and clearing the border, was actually waiting for an opportunity and had ulterior motives. Chahar Province cannot ignore this. Also, at the beginning of the battle at Xifengzhai, it was widely rumored that the Japanese army was invading eastern Chahar in three routes: the northern route attacking Guyuan from Duolun, the central route probing Dushikou from Dage in Rehe, and the southern route attacking Chicheng from Heihe. The garrison troops of Liu Guitang in Chicheng, because the Chicheng area was difficult to control, once moved their headquarters to Yangtianbao, southeast of the county. When they heard that the battle had stopped, they led their troops back into the city to garrison.</p>
<h3 id="e82">Mixed Troops Undergoing Reorganization <a href="#e82" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c82" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">82</a></h3>
<p>Since the incident, the troops in Chahar Province have been complex and varied. After Song Zheyuan returned to Chahar, he actively reorganized them and personally went to various places to review and address the troops. Progress has been made so far, but some units still need thorough reorganization. For example, the Huang Shouzhong unit stationed near Xifengzhai in eastern Chahar was originally a habitual bandit in the Chahar-Rehe border area. After being incorporated, they became a detachment commander, but kidnapping and extortion continued as before. As for the □□□ and other units, their relationship with the Japanese and puppet troops is still entangled. Representatives come to the provincial capital from time to time, either requesting funds or asking for more equipment. The recent incident in eastern Chahar has given these people an opportunity to threaten. Song Zheyuan recently told a representative of a certain unit, "I have three ways of treating the various units: first, if they train hard according to the methods of training troops, I will treat them well; second, if they are neither close nor distant and just perfunctorily go through the motions, I will also treat them perfunctorily; third, if they act like bandits, I will treat them like bandits." These words, both gentle and stern, serve as a warning.</p>
<h3 id="e83">Tang Yulin's Troops Reorganized <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Tang Yulin, the former chairman of Rehe, who once held great power and influence, has, since losing his province, been impoverished and forced to the border of Rehe. Recently, he arrived in Chahar, transferred his troops to Chahar Province, and went to Zhangjiakou alone. Song Zheyuan appointed him as the chief advisor of the 29th Army, and he has taken office. Tang now lives in the house of the cattle and sheep tax investigation office in Xiabao, Zhangjiakou, with more than twenty guards and more than twenty stable servants. He has nothing to do every day except for social engagements. His son, Tang Zuo, and others are in Tianjin and send people to Zhangjiakou from time to time to inquire. Tang Yulin recently intended to leave Zhangjiakou and sent someone to see Song Zheyuan to discuss it. Song asked him to rest in Zhangjiakou because he had been running around for years, so Tang is not going elsewhere for the time being. As for his troops, including one brigade of Dong Futing, one brigade of Zheng Guilin, and Shao's regiment and Cui's regiment, totaling about eight thousand people, equipped with more than twenty cannons, most of them are stationed in Zhangbei. A portion, about a thousand people, were transferred to the outside of the Dajingmen in Zhangjiakou on the 15th and 16th of the month for unarmed training. When they handed in their guns, there was a conflict with the provincial army, which was quickly resolved. Zheng Guilin's unit was originally stationed in southern Tianjin. After a mutiny, they inquired their way to eastern Chahar and joined Tang. Now that Tang has handed over his troops to Chahar Province, Zheng fears for his own safety and has fled without a trace.</p>

<p>Zhangjiakou is peaceful, and the market has returned to its state before the incident. There is no curfew at night. However, since the situation in eastern Chahar has become increasingly tense, the provincial government area has strengthened its defenses. The number of representatives staying in hotels and inns is not as high as it was during the Allied Army era. The weather is cold, and this year it is a little later than usual. According to visitors, heavy snow has fallen early in Zhangduogonghui, Jiabu Temple, and the area north of Zhangjiakou. The cold wind and snow are blowing every day, stinging the face and chilling the bones. Even wearing heavy fur coats is not enough to keep warm. Also, German-owned companies' cars travel between Zhangjiakou and Kulun to transport and sell goods, but due to the restrictions in Kulun, this has little positive impact on the Zhangjiakou market.

<h3 id="e85">Tibetan Residents in Beiping Concerned About the Tibetan Situation <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>The Panchen Lama Will Return to Tibet via Nanjing from Bailing Temple</p>
<p>Li Erbukun Has Gone to Nanjing to Handle Tibetan Affairs</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After the news of the Dalai Lama's death reached Beiping, the Beiping Office of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission immediately sent a telegram to the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission in Nanjing to inquire about the truth. As of today (21st), no reply telegram has arrived in Beiping. There are many lamas among the Tibetan residents in Beiping, who are very concerned about Tibetan affairs. Today (21st), Ms. Sun Bozhuang and others went to the Panchen Lama's office for discussions. According to reliable information from the Tibetan side, the Dalai Lama's representative, Gunqiao Zhongni, came to Beiping before the 20th and told people that the Dalai Lama was old and that the successor was very important in case of his death. The Dalai Lama did not favor the British during his life and originally wanted the central government to send troops to protect Tibet to avoid any incidents, but he was also concerned that his reach was too limited. Gunqiao Zhongni originally planned to go to Jiangxi to meet with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to ask for instructions on everything, but unexpectedly the Dalai Lama passed away in Lhasa on the 17th. It is very difficult to produce a new Dalai Lama, because Lamaism forbids marriage, and the Dalai Lama has no wife or children, so there is no successor at the moment. The Silon Kagsha and Yicang are temporarily acting in charge of Tibetan political and religious affairs. However, it is not yet certain whether the Silon and others can manage everything during the transition period. Before the Dalai Lama died, he tried to persuade those with radical ideas among the Tibetan youth. Some Tibetan youths believed that the Dalai Lama was suppressing the youth, but there were no special actions. Now that the Dalai Lama is dead, according to religious customs, divination must be done to calculate where an infant is born. This infant is particularly divine and can point out what object and what name is. Then, everyone believes that the Dalai Lama has reincarnated, and the Silon Kagsha and Yicang go to welcome him back to Lhasa and perform the Hobilgan ceremony. Then, this infant is no longer a child of the people, but becomes the new Dalai Lama Living Buddha. After reaching adulthood, he can inherit the throne and take control of Tibetan political and religious power. However, it is not known when the new Dalai Lama will succeed to the throne. The British have been coveting Tibet for a long time. During the transition period, if the Silon and others can win the trust of the people and maintain order properly, then Tibet can still survive. Otherwise, the central government must send personnel to Tibet to assist the Silon and others in maintaining law and order, because the Tibetan issue is even more important than the issue of autonomy in Inner Mongolia. Currently, the Tibetan people are divided into two factions: one faction supports the Dalai Lama, mostly Red Sect followers, and most of them are from the former Tibet; the other faction supports the Panchen Lama, mostly Yellow Sect followers, and most of them are from the latter Tibet. In fact, neither faction has a clear system, and they do not care about politics, only knowing how to chant scriptures, but among the Tibetans, those who support the Dalai Lama are more numerous.</p>
<p>After the Dalai Lama's death, the center of gravity of Tibetan politics and religion was lost. Now that the Panchen Erdeni, who is staying in Bailing Temple, should be able to return to Tibet without any problems. This summer, the Panchen Lama sent someone to Tibet to negotiate, and three major temples expressed their welcome. Now that the Dalai Lama has passed away, someone is needed to preside over Tibetan politics, so it will be easier to realize it sooner. However, there are still some obstacles, which must be cleared in advance. The Panchen Lama will pass through Beiping two or three days after leaving the temple and then go to Nanjing to pay respects to the key figures of the National Government. In addition to reporting on the resolution of the Inner Mongolia autonomy issue, he will also ask for instructions on how to return to Tibet. According to A Shansheng, a Tibetan who is close to the Panchen Lama, the Panchen Lama has never interfered in Tibetan political and military affairs and only presided over religious affairs when he was in Tibet. This time when he returns to Tibet, he will take the will of the central government as his will, console the Tibetan people, and teach the new Dalai Lama the classics.</p>
<p>The Tibetan Office in Beiping has matters to discuss with Nanjing due to the Dalai Lama's death, and the Tibetan representative in Nanjing, Awang Zhaba, sent a telegram instructing Deputy Director Li Erbukun to go there. Li told reporters at the station today that after the Dalai Lama Living Buddha passed away, Tibetan political affairs were in charge of the Silon Kagsha.

<p>Military Police Patrol Guangzhou City Day and Night</p>
<p>Personnel Sent to Build Defense Works in the Suburbs</p>
<p>The City of Nanxiong in Northern Guangdong Digs a Moat Around the City</p>
<p>Northeastern Trenches Can Accommodate Cars</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: According to a report, Guangdong Province authorities recently found slogans of the Fujian puppet organization in Jiangmen, and immediately ordered the military and police to take strict precautions. The Guangzhou Public Security Bureau also recently arrested the abbot of the Nengren Temple on Baiyun Mountain, Monk Manshu Jiedi, in the suburbs of Guangzhou. The monk, also known as Wan Quan, has been in the temple for several years. He does not seem like an outsider, has a little talent, and is boastful and impulsive. When Chen Mingshu was in charge of Guangdong's administration years ago, he had close contacts with him. This arrest is said to be related to the Fujian side. Another theory is that the monk has recently recruited many traveling monks, and the authorities fear that he has a political purpose, so they arrested him. After being arrested, he was detained in the Public Security Bureau and is being interrogated strictly. Since these cases occurred, the military and police have been even more strict in carrying out winter defense. Starting on the 16th, the Military Police Headquarters added five patrol teams to each team, with three people in each team, for a total of seventy-five teams, to patrol the city. In addition, five bicycle patrol teams were formed, with five bicycles in each team, patrolling from 10:00 AM every day and resting at 12:00 PM at night. The military police team has recently expanded to a total of fourteen teams, specializing in maintaining law and order in the city and dividing the area for defense. The first team is stationed in Meihua Village, the second team is stationed at the Guangzhou-Kowloon Station and Shenzhen Market, the third team is stationed at the Guangxi Guild Hall and Shiwitang, the fourth team is stationed at the Second Ordnance Factory in the eastern suburbs, the fifth team is stationed at the Pacification Office in the central district, the sixth team is stationed at Shougouling, the seventh team is stationed at the Yingde Mine, the eighth team is stationed at Yongshing Temple, the ninth team is stationed at the Zhaoqing Guild Hall, the tenth team is stationed at the Bayi Guild Hall, the eleventh team is stationed at the Provincial Government and the Southwestern Executive Department of the Party, the twelfth team is stationed at Yantang, the thirteenth team is stationed at the Radio Station in the northern suburbs, and the fourteenth team is stationed at the Headquarters of the First Army Group. As for Yaotou, Geshan, Xiaogang, Shayuan, Erchongkou and other places in the suburbs of Henan, the Public Security Bureau sent two squads of security teams to guard the key points and added detectives to patrol secretly. Panyu County's third and sixth districts, including Huatai, Fangcun, and other twenty-four villages, were also instructed to organize a joint defense to prevent bandits from mixing in. Iron wire nets have recently been added to the waterways of the provincial river by personnel from the Fleet Command and the teaching division of engineers. The defenses are also said to be tight.</p>
<p>Guangdong Province's border defense work has been booming in recent days. It is said that Nanxiong, in the north of the Beijiang River, which is adjacent to southern Jiangxi, began digging trenches at the beginning of this month. The Independent Third Division of the Defense Army, together with various mass organizations, is actively digging trenches and collecting conscripted labor. A total of 20,000 young men were conscripted, and funds were raised from all walks of life. The moat outside the city is being constructed in nine sections. The depth of the moat is over nine feet, the width is seventeen or eight feet, and the length is a circle around the city. In addition, there are many defense works set up in the Dongjiang area, and three lines of defense are arranged. In Fengshun alone, in addition to dangerous trenches, there are more than a hundred gun emplacements. Cars can be used to transport goods inside the trenches. The authorities have purchased a large number of transport vehicles in recent days and handed them over to the transport station for distribution to the front lines. The first batch of sixteen six-wheeled heavy trucks has been transported, and the second batch of twenty has also been. In addition, cannonballs and military supplies are being transported to Shantou by the An An warship for transfer to the front lines for use. As for Humen, which is the gateway to Guangdong by sea, a general curfew has been imposed at night recently. If any suspicious ships pass by, they are ordered to stop and wait for inspection to prevent bandits from transporting them secretly. (December 20th)</p>

<p>Now is the winter defense period, and winter defense offices have been established everywhere. However, robbery cases are still being heard every day. The Wutong Temple in Fengjing was robbed the night before, with losses of over a thousand yuan. The day before yesterday, the family of Xu Fuquan near the Southwest Catholic Church in Caojing Township was suddenly attacked by more than ten bandits in the late evening. They broke into the house and searched everywhere, losing a lot of clothes and other items before leaving with shouts. That night, the family of Shen Yaqing in Qiangmenqiao in the township, Yaqing works in Songcheng, and only his old mother, younger brother and younger sister live at home. The family had already gone to bed when the bandits broke in suddenly, giving them no time to avoid them. They were forced to reveal the location of their hidden silver, but because the family was ordinary, there was nothing to satisfy the bandits' greed. Finally, they stole five chickens and left in a huff.</p>

<p>Ji Guoyong, director of the Fifth Branch of the Beixia Experimental Zone, Magiali, Xicang Town, recently felt that the traffic in Xicang Town was blocked. He specially initiated the construction of a road connecting to Dongting and directly to Wuxi with ten local gentlemen, including Cai Zixing (brother of Cai Ziping) and Sima Nanyun. Each household along the way was required to contribute two workers. Those who did not want to or had no one to work had to pay 4.5 jiao for each worker in lieu of labor. All the procedures and procedures had been submitted to the county government for approval and implementation, and a notice was issued to inform the public. The groundbreaking ceremony was held in the auditorium of Xicang Elementary School the day before. It is expected to be completed and opened to traffic next spring. In the future, it will be possible to visit the ancient sites of Liang Hong and Taibo in Hongshan from the city by bicycle or rickshaw without having to work hard.</p>

<p>Zhu Changhou of No. 33, Chengquan Lane, Wuyi, is engaged in business in Hankou. His wife, Zhu Wang, nicknamed Wang Erjie, has two sons and one daughter who live in Changzhou. In September of this year, Zhu Wang took in a maid named Jinfeng, who was only nine years old. Zhu Wang often beat her violently, leaving her body covered in wounds, which was unbearable to witness. The neighbors who heard the news felt sorry for her. Recently, Jinhong became ill due to injuries, but Zhu Wang still did not treat her and ordered her to work as usual. At night, she slept on the ground with only broken cotton wool to keep her warm. Jinfeng died tragically on the ground yesterday morning (21st). Zhu Wang knew that she had caused a disaster and immediately fled with her daughter without a trace. After the neighbors discovered the incident, they immediately reported it to the Public Security Bureau, asking them to send someone to investigate and to report it to the County Court for autopsy. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent inspector Zhu Jintao to investigate and saw that the corpse had scalds and claw marks. Then, Yang Kongyi, the chief prosecutor of the County Court, led officials to the autopsy, which confirmed that she had died from abuse and injuries. He immediately ordered the local bailiff to inform Jinfeng's family to collect the body and conduct further investigation and handling.</p>

<p>The Wuyi Nanzhai and Jiangyin shipping boats recently heard about Changzhou one after another. Yesterday morning (21st) at about 4:00 a.m., after passengers boarded and goods were loaded, they set sail. When they sailed to the south of Yangtouqiao, the Nanzhai boat was in front and the Jiangyin boat was behind, about a mile apart. Suddenly, five bandits armed with box guns ordered the Nanzhai boat to stop. The bandits boarded the boat and searched before leaving. Just as the Jiangyin shipping boat arrived, the bandits boarded the boat again and searched. None of the boat owners or passengers were spared. Afterwards, the Jiangyin shipping boat returned to Changzhou and reported to the Fourth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, requesting that the stolen goods and bandits be pursued and dealt with according to law.</p>

<p>Wu Luogen, a large farmer in Xitang Township, Fifth District, has quite a lot of savings at home, but he is usually quite frugal. Because he was coveted by bandits, he suddenly received a letter from bandits a few days ago, with many threatening words, demanding 500 yuan. Luogen was extremely panicked, but had no choice but to put it aside and ignore it. Three days later, he received another letter, with even more violent language. Wu was afraid of accidents and went to report to the District Office, requesting an investigation. On the 20th, Wu suddenly received a third letter, which stated that there was no news from the previous two letters. This is the final warning, and he was asked to bring the money to the Ximen Xie Shui Lujiiao within three days to discuss the matter. Otherwise, there will be disadvantages. At this point, Wu gained some insight. He remembered that the monk Zongde of the nearby Guanyin Temple was not pure in his six senses and acted irregularly, and suspected that he was the one who did it. He reported his suspicions to the District Office and forwarded it to the jurisdictional Public Security Bureau. The Public Security Bureau immediately sent police to arrest the suspect monk and take him to the District Office. After detailed questioning and verification of the handwriting, it seemed similar. Just as they were about to send him to the Public Security Bureau, the monk suddenly took advantage of people's lack of preparation and escaped. By the time they noticed, there was no trace of him. Now, Xu Jingyu, the district chief of the district, has presented a request to the county for punishment, and has reported to the authorities requesting a search.</p>

<p>Ma Chaoyuan, director of the regimental affairs of the County Security Committee, checked and arrested the Yanguan of Chen Aisheng's family in the first group of Hucao Port in the Third District last month, which involved a head of the first group, Chen Songshan. The county government's handling was untrue and incomplete, so he applied to resign and accused Magistrate Ruan of appointing private individuals and harboring Zhu Wen, the head of the Third District, and others in six counts to the Provincial Security Committee of the Civil Affairs Department. The Provincial Department, according to the report, ordered the Second District Administrative Inspectorate to thoroughly investigate. Commissioner Cai commissioned investigator Qin Ticheng to come to Cheng on the 20th and first went to the County Government to review the files. He attached great importance to this case and personally went to Hucao Port to investigate, hoping to obtain the truth for verification.</p>

<p>Dinghai Shrimp Isle, separated from Peach Blossom by only a stream, faces Shenjiamen to the east. Small steamboats return every other day. The terrain is dangerous. The residents live closely together, and the Shishi stone pier where the ships dock is especially strategically located, with a shape of one man holds the pass, ten thousand men cannot pass through. Therefore, for more than two hundred years, no robbery cases have occurred. After the Dacheng Grocery Store was robbed this spring, the Taiwanese bandit Xiang Langao's gang, with the cooperation of an insider, learned about the internal situation. At dawn on the 19th, suddenly five or sixty big sea bandits came, each equipped with wooden shell guns, pistols, etc., and looted wantonly. Before leaving, they kidnapped twelve residents, making it an unprecedented major robbery case on the island.</p>

A neighbor, Mr. Jia, immediately reported to the nearby bodyguard team, and the captain led a number of people to rescue him. They happened to meet the bandits, and both sides exchanged gunfire for half an hour. The bandits were finally unable to resist and abandoned the ticket and escaped.</p>

However, Xu Jingsheng was extremely extravagant and spent money wastefully. In recent years, the rural economy has gone bankrupt, and all industries have declined, so life is extremely difficult. Zhou often offered advice, but not only did he not listen, but he was scolded. Recently, he has become even more intense, engaging in gambling, and beating her when he is angry. Zhou has repeatedly considered that there is no way to go but to commit suicide, so she hanged herself in the room the day before (20th). The neighbors all lamented it.</p>

This statement is absolutely untrue, and I have already formally denied it to all parties. Kong went to the Central Bank to work at about 11:00 a.m. and will return to Nanjing next week.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Re-inspection of Foreign Ships Going to Fujian <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Inspected in the Sandu Sea Area</p>
<p>When the British merchant ship Yihe Hengsheng arrived in Fuzhou, it was inspected by the Navy's Yixian ship. The British Consul in Nanjing protested and the inspection was stopped. Afterwards, when the Jiesheng ship entered and exited, the inspection was stopped. Recently, due to the outbreak of war rituals in Fujian, the central government, in order to strictly prevent smuggling on the sea, re-negotiated with the British Consulate to implement inspections on foreign ships traveling between Shanghai and Fujian. The situation is recorded separately as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e105">Customs Inspection of Outbound Goods <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Recently, among goods shipped from Shanghai to Fuzhou, aside from textiles, food is the most prevalent. White rice and flour are shipped in the largest quantities. Traditionally, food exports haven't required customs inspection. However, due to a central government order and deep concerns about the possibility of smuggling military supplies along with rice and flour destined for Fujian Province, customs inspection is now required. Food export inspection has been implemented, and this is the first time. Therefore, for several days, any goods being shipped to Fujian are subject to inspection by customs officers, and the enforcement is quite strict.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Inspection of Merchant Ships <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>Currently, only Jardine Matheson's "Chefoo" vessel operates between Shanghai and Fuzhou. Recently, due to the serious situation, consultations with various shipping companies have resulted in an agreement that both inbound and outbound ships must be inspected at Sandu Ao. Navy personnel will board the ships to conduct thorough searches, especially of passengers and their luggage. However, cargo holds are exempt from inspection. During its recent trip to Shanghai, Jardine Matheson's "Chefoo" was inspected again when passing through Sandu Ao.</p>

<p>According to the "New Voice Society," the Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation reported that since yesterday, official telegrams from rebel forces in the Yanping area have been continuous, causing severe congestion. Consequently, ordinary commercial telegrams to and from Yanping and Fuzhou have been temporarily suspended. However, the telegraph lines remain open. It seems that intense fighting has not yet occurred in areas such as Jian'ou and Jianyang.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Weak Military Strength in Fujian <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Outward Expansion Unlikely</p>
<p>According to the "New Voice Society," a semi-official source reported yesterday morning that the deployments of the 19th Route Army and the Communist bandits in northern Fujian indicate that the 19th Route Army has not yet formally engaged the Central Army. However, a portion of the army is currently advancing from Shuikou along the river towards Nanping (Yanping). But the 19th Route Army does not currently possess sufficient strength to expand outwards. Military observers believe that while outward expansion might significantly benefit the 19th Route Army, it is unlikely to be achieved in reality. Therefore, rumors of engagement with the Central Army and a three-pronged northern offensive are untrue. The current deployments of the 19th Route Army and Communist bandits are as follows: (A) The 19th Route Army has a total strength of 45,000 men, including 15,000 men reorganized from the old units of Zhang Zhen and Chen Guohui. Their recent deployments are: one brigade of Zhang's old units stationed in Yunxiao and Zhao'an in southern Fujian; one division of Gao Yi and Chen Guohui's old units stationed in Xiamen, Dehua, Yongchun, Anxi, and Tong'an; one division of the 19th Route Army stationed in Yanping, Jianning, and Shaowu in northwestern Fujian; one division and one brigade of the 19th Route Army stationed in Fuzhou and Putian; and one division and one brigade of the 19th Route Army stationed in Zhangzhou, Changtai, Huacun, Zhangping, Ningyang, Hexi, and Shizhong in southern Fujian. As for the Communist bandits, remnants have some influence in Zhenghe in northern Fujian and Qingyuan and Longquan near the Zhejiang border. The bandit forces in the Jiangxi area, below Jianchang, along the coast, and along the Yangtze River in western Fujian, are relatively strong. They are currently attempting to advance northward from Jianchang and disturb the Zhejiang border. Therefore, recent rumors of contact between Fujian and Zhejiang actually refer to the Communist bandits' advance into Zhejiang and clashes with the Central Army. It is also reported that the Fujian army, except for the advance in the Yanping and Jian'ou areas and slight contact with Liu Heding's troops within Fujian, has not encountered the Central Army.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Further Efforts to Persuade Workers to Return to Work Failed</p>
<p>Negotiations to Resolve the Issue Scheduled for Today</p>
<p>According to "Dagong News," workers at the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway factory in Zhanghuabang, Wusong, declared a strike on the 18th of this month in protest against the transfer of staff by Chief of General Affairs Mo Heng and the suppression of the labor movement. They demanded Mo Heng's dismissal. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, representatives from the railway administration, the Party branch, and the labor union went to Wusong to persuade the workers to return to work, but to no avail. The Ministry of Railways has dispatched counselors Wang Wenbin and Zhang Weici to conduct a thorough investigation. The details are reported below.</p>

<p>Since the labor dispute broke out at the Wusong factory, the railway administration has consulted with the special Party branches and labor unions of the two railways to find a solution. A decision was made to form an investigation committee to thoroughly investigate the workers' accusations against Mo Heng. The workers were urged to return to work first, and then the investigation would proceed. Yesterday morning at 8:00 AM, Yuan Boyang, Wang Bi, Fan Shouzheng, and Lu Baogan from the railway administration, along with Zou Kexin, Chen Chengshi, and Li Dasan from the Party branches of the two railways, and Liang Luoheng and Chen Bohua from the labor unions of the two railways, traveled to the Zhanghuabang factory. Representatives from the railway administration summoned the foremen of each workshop, while representatives from the Party branch and the labor union summoned all staff of the Wusong office of the railway union, to persuade them to return to work separately. However, the workers insisted that Mo Heng must be dismissed first before they would agree to return to work, so the efforts were unsuccessful. All workers continued their strike.</p>

<p>Railway Minister Gu Mengyu, after receiving reports from the directors of the two railways, Huang Bobiao, and the special Party branches and labor unions of the two railways, regarding the strike at the Wusong factory in protest against the removal of Mo Heng, the Chief of General Affairs and Chief of the Materials Department, immediately telegraphed the railway administration to properly restrain the situation and dispatched counselors Wang Wenbin and Zhang Weici to Shanghai for a thorough investigation. They arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM yesterday. They first went to the railway administration to inquire about the details and then proceeded to the Zhanghuabang factory to investigate the truth of the labor dispute in order to find a solution.</p>

<p>After arriving in Shanghai, the Ministry of Railways' counselors Wang Wenbin and Zhang Weici, in addition to investigating the circumstances of the labor dispute from all parties in order to find a solution, scheduled a meeting for today with representatives from the railway administration, the Party branch, the labor union, and the workers to discuss a resolution. At the same time, they will thoroughly investigate the workers' accusations against Mo Heng in order to clarify the truth.</p>

<p>A reporter from "Dagong News" visited the railway administration yesterday. According to a person in charge, the recent news reports about the labor dispute at the two railways' factory did not reflect the facts. The workers at the Wusong factory and the Materials Department suddenly went on strike to protest the transfer of staff member Cao Wenkui by Chief of General Affairs Mo Heng. The railway administration has the inherent administrative power to transfer staff. If they are dissatisfied with the railway administration's actions, they should make a formal complaint. The workers' sudden strike is unfortunate because they did not follow proper procedures. The claim that Mo Heng purchased inferior materials that could not be used since he also became Chief of the Materials Department is a deliberate slander. The Ministry of Railways has sent personnel to Shanghai to investigate, and the truth will be revealed. However, it would be incorrect to dismiss Mo Heng before the investigation is complete.</p>

<p>Repeated Consultations on Funding Issues</p>
<p>Land in Xuejiabang to Be Auctioned</p>
<p>Due to low grain prices harming farmers, the central government is considering government-run grain stockpiling to provide relief. According to the person in charge of the Municipal Society's Zeng Bureau, the city is also planning to carry out government-run grain stockpiling. Funding has been discussed several times. The city already has grain reserves, funds, and real estate. Before the arrival of the National Revolutionary Army in Shanghai, the funds were misappropriated by former Shanghai-Songhu Defense Commissioner He Fenglin. Only the land west of the Santai Wharf in Xuejiabang remains, valued at approximately 400,000 yuan. This property is jointly owned by the province and the city. The city owns two-thirds of the property, and the province owns one-third. Both parties will auction the land in the future and use two-thirds of the proceeds to purchase rice and build warehouses for stockpiling.</p>

<p>Unemployment Increases by 60,000, Causing Panic About Livelihood</p>
<p>Request to Forward Petition to Central Government for Assistance</p>
<p>According to "Dagong News," Shanghai's silk reeling factories have been affected by the Japanese silk market and exports to Europe and America, leading to a sharp drop in silk prices. As a result, factories are closing one after another, and unemployment has increased by 60,000, causing panic about livelihoods. Yesterday morning, silk reeling unions jointly petitioned Party and government organs, requesting that the central government be informed and assistance be provided. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Joint Petition Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Chen Xiupu, Le Xiaorong, Chen Yundi, Yuan Yunlong, Yang Gengti, and Wu Suzhen, the directors of the silk reeling unions of the third, fourth, and sixth districts of Shanghai, led more than 31 representatives from various factories to petition the municipal Party headquarters. They requested that the central government be promptly notified and assistance be provided to the silk industry, and that the factories be ordered to reopen to maintain the livelihoods of the workers. Zhu Yangwu, a cadre of the Civil Affairs Section, received them and promised to submit the petition to the Executive Committee for consideration. The representatives expressed their satisfaction and then went to the municipal government to petition. Representatives from the Second Section received them and promised to submit the difficulties of the silk industry to the mayor for review and action. The representatives also went to the Social Affairs Bureau to make the same petition.</p>
<p>Request for Relief Yesterday, the Industrial Union of the silk reeling industry of the fourth and sixth districts of Shanghai submitted a document to the municipal Party headquarters, the municipal government, and the Social Affairs Bureau, stating: "Regarding the request for relief for unemployment and the maintenance of workers' livelihoods, the more than 60,000 male members of our union depend on silk factories for a living. In recent years, due to the slump in the silk market, the factories have repeatedly failed. Fortunately, the government has provided assistance twice, allowing them to barely maintain work for more than half of the workers. Tens of thousands of workers rely on this to eke out a living. Since the autumn of this year, silk prices have plummeted, setting a new low. The factories intended to continue to operate, but bankruptcies have followed one another, and closures and shutdowns have occurred one after another. In each district, fewer than ten factories are barely maintaining operations. The situation is precarious and cannot be described in words. If this continues, all factories in the city will shut down completely in the near future. Tens of thousands of workers in our union will all be unemployed, their livelihoods will be without support, and they will all starve to death. All the workers are worried and anxious, and they come to the union to ask for assistance. We are horrified by this situation. If we do not seek relief urgently, it is inevitable that they will take risks, which will affect social stability. Therefore, after a joint meeting, we unanimously decided to request that your departments (government bureaus) telegraph the central government to provide relief to maintain the livelihoods of the workers and ensure social order. We are eagerly awaiting orders."</p>
<h3 id="e118">Cotton Control Committee's Efforts to Stabilize Yarn Prices <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Remarks by Committee Member Li Shengbo</p>
<p>According to "Dagong News," due to the excessive amount of yarn stored in the Hua Shang Yarn and Cloth Exchange, which affected the market, the Cotton Control Committee established the He Xing Company to purchase some of the stored yarn to facilitate circulation. The committee also requested the Ministry of Industry to order the exchange to stop accepting new yarn from October onwards to show restriction. A reporter from "Dagong News" visited the Cotton Control Committee yesterday to inquire about the details of this matter and future solutions. Committee member Li Shengbo received him and provided a detailed explanation.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Reasons for Purchasing Stored Yarn <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Li said that when yarn prices were extremely depressed, it was the beginning of the autumn sales season. However, because market prices were falling daily, yarn merchants were reluctant to operate, and farmers had no yarn to weave. As a result, the yarn stored in the Yarn and Cloth Exchange became increasingly large. At that time, the exchange had 36,000 bales of yarn in storage, and the market was falling more and more sharply. In order to stabilize the market, the Cotton Control Committee decided to negotiate with the Yong'an in Shanghai, the Qingfeng in Wuxi, and the Dasheng in Nantong to organize the He Xing Company. The He Xing company bought 15,000 bales of yarn to stabilize market prices, allowing the yarn merchants to boldly purchase the remaining 21,000 bales of yarn.</p>
<h3 id="e120">Continued Delivery of New Yarn in Violation of the Agreement <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Unexpectedly, after He Xing Company purchased 15,000 bales, Shen Xin Factory continued to deliver 8,000 bales of substandard yarn. The Yarn and Cloth Exchange did not stop it, limited by regulations. In view of this situation, the Cotton Control Committee requested the Ministry of Industry to order the exchange not to accept new yarn for new transactions from October onwards. In addition, the Yarn Manufacturers Association and other associations would work together to clear the newly delivered 8,000 bales of yarn to a total of 29,000 bales, because the Yarn Manufacturers Association passed a resolution in July to restrict factories from delivering new yarn.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Methods for Clearing Stored Yarn <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>After discussions among the Cotton Control Committee, the Yarn Manufacturers Association, and the Yarn and Cloth Exchange, it was decided that the Shen Xin Factory would take 7,000 bales of the yarn, and the exchange would take 10,000 bales. The price was set at 170 yuan per bale. This price is the lowest in 15 years. Even if it were sold in the interior, there would be no loss. The contract has been signed and submitted to the Ministry of Industry for record. It is planned to clear it by the end of this year.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Losses from Purchasing Stored Yarn <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Of the 15,000 bales of yarn purchased, 12,000 bales have been sold in various regions. The remaining 3,000 bales have not been sold, but it has been decided to clear it by the end of this year. On each bale, there will be a loss of six or seven yuan for a total of over 100,000 yuan. At the beginning of the Cotton Control Committee's actions, the committee planned to request a 4 million yuan appropriation from the central government to prepare for the purchase of this inferior yarn. However, due to the change in finance ministers from Song Ziwen to Kong Xiangxi, and the Fujian Incident, the government's finances were exhausted, so the plan was put on hold. Otherwise, this difficulty would have been resolved earlier.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Standard Grading Restrictions <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>In order to prevent such problems in the future, the Cotton Control Committee plans to revise the current standards of the exchange using scientific methods. Requirements such as tensile strength, fiber color, and brand will be combined. The new standards and regulations are being drafted. After being approved by the exchange, they will be submitted to the Ministry of Industry for record and implementation. Generally, one yuan is one level. If the cotton is less than 70 percent, it does not meet the standards, and the exchange will not accept it. The Cotton Control Committee plans to send eight experts to jointly appraise the cotton at the exchange.</p>

<p>Definite Date for Disconnecting and Reconnecting Phones</p>
<p>Separate Letter to Follow</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company issued a notice to Pudong users stating, "We provide services to organizations within the Public and French Concessions. However, for the convenience of users with houses in Pudong, we have also provided telephone services in Pudong for many years. Since April 19, 1933, when we signed a temporary agreement with the Chinese authorities, one of the clauses stated that the Ministry of Communications' Telephone Bureau could request the removal of all Pudong telephones with 30 days' notice. We issued a special notice to all affected users regarding this matter on April 19, 1933. We have now received a notice from the Ministry of Communications' Shanghai Telephone Bureau stating that the Bureau plans to take over our Pudong telephones in early 1934. After the takeover, all Pudong telephones will become part of the Ministry of Communications' Telephone Bureau's mutual communication system with our company. Therefore, the Shanghai Telephone Company is issuing this notice to all users affected by the above actions of the Ministry of Communications' Telephone Bureau. Your contract with our company will also be terminated when this change takes place. Afterwards, if you still require telephone service, please contact the Ministry of Communications' Shanghai Telephone Bureau. We are currently discussing with the Ministry of Communications' Shanghai Telephone Bureau the disconnection from our system and reconnection to the Ministry of Communications' Telephone Bureau's system for all users who will continue to receive service from that Bureau. The disconnection and reconnection will be done at night on the agreed date. We will send you another letter to inform you of the exact date of termination of the contract. Please accept our best wishes." Pan Lai, Director of the Business Department.</p>

<p>Trial Held at the British Police Court Yesterday</p>
<p>According to the "Great American Evening Post," the Indian, Sun Tai Xin, was arrested after distributing anti-British leaflets in Shanghai. He had been sought by the Public Concession Police for two years. The British Consulate Police Court held a trial this morning (the 22nd). Sun Tai Xin distributed seditious printed materials at the corner of Sichuan Road and Qiujiang Road in 1930. He was found guilty, so the court transferred him to the British Assize Court for trial. The date will be determined later. Today, Sun Tai Xin stood in the dock and listened to the testimony of the witnesses. When the royal lawyer asked him questions, he always answered, "No problem." When asked about his crimes, Sun Tai Xin raised his head and replied, "There is nothing in the leaflets that is hostile to the British government. It is the same as the current movement in India. The British government's actions in India and the bloodshed in India are all written in it." The court then warned him that the purpose of the trial was to determine whether he had committed the crimes he was accused of. Sun Tai Xin then said, "I was accused of distributing leaflets, so I must explain the reasons for distributing leaflets. The appeals of the Indian people cannot be heard, so I distributed leaflets to tell the world. There is nothing else to say." The defendant was arrested near Bazhi Road for fighting and committing assault, so the Police Court will also hold a hearing on the illegal assault case next Thursday.</p>

<p>Postal Authorities Request Secret Investigation</p>
<p>According to "New News," since the September 18th and January 28th Incidents, the postal authorities have stopped delivering letters to the three northeastern provinces, and domestic and foreign communication has also been cut off. It is now confirmed that Japanese ronin are taking advantage of the opportunity and secretly establishing agencies in Shanghai, Beijing, Tianjin, and Hankou. They are specializing in selling Japanese stamps and hiring ships of a certain country to privately deliver all letters between the interior and Northeast China, earning huge profits. The Chinese postal authorities have repeatedly received secret reports. This act of the Japanese ronin not only destroys China's entire postal organization but also infringes on China's sovereignty. It is heard that the postal authorities will report to the central government and order the military and police in various places to strictly investigate. Once evidence is obtained, they will file a complaint.</p>

<p>Manufacturers Discussed Exchange Conditions for Tax Exemption Yesterday</p>
<p>Eight Thousand Tons of Imported Wheat Have Already Arrived in Shanghai</p>
<p>Regarding the flour manufacturers' request for tax exemption on purchased imported wheat, Minister Kong Xiangxi has decided to convene the manufacturers' delegation this morning to discuss the tax exemption method. Last night at 6:00 PM, representatives from various flour mills held an emergency meeting to discuss the exchange conditions for tax exemption proposed by the government. Eight thousand tons of imported wheat ordered directly by the manufacturers from foreign companies arrived yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e128">Negotiations on Tax Exemption This Morning <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>After flour manufacturers from Shanghai and various counties in the interior held a joint representative meeting and organized a delegation to petition the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance's Customs Administration, there were some indications of tax exemption. Minister Kong Xiangxi came to Shanghai from Beijing yesterday to contact financial circles about central government finances and to convene the manufacturers' delegation at the Central Bank at 10:00 AM this morning to discuss tax exemption.</p>
<h3 id="e129">Emergency Meeting of Manufacturers <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>Last night at 6:00 PM, the Flour Manufacturers Association convened manufacturers from various counties at the New Opening River Association Hall on the fourth floor to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the conditions for tax exemption proposed by the Ministry of Finance and distribute the meeting's content. The discussions were kept secret. According to reporters from "Dagong News," the so-called exchange conditions are a fixed amount of imported goods worth 4 million US dollars. If the manufacturers fully agree, the tax on the purchased imported wheat can be exempted.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Imported Wheat Arrived Yesterday <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Before the Ministry of Finance officially announced the import tax on American wheat, flour, and flour, the flour manufacturers, in addition to contracting for nine ships of American wheat, ordered 14 ships of imported wheat, totaling 75,000 tons, from foreign companies such as Shunquanlong and Xiangmao in Shanghai. At 4:00 PM yesterday, the Honghai Wheel loaded 8,000 tons of imported wheat and arrived, berthing at buoy number 7 in Yangshupu. The ship is managed by Xiangmao Foreign Company. The manufacturers suspended unloading because the tax exemption had not been satisfactorily resolved. Wheat managed by companies such as Heyi, Xinfu, and Shunquanlong will continue to arrive in the coming days.</p>
<h3 id="e131">Yao Wennan and Others Request That the Municipal Government Issue Land Certificates Locally <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>Recounting the Difficulties Faced by Villagers in Going to Government Offices</p>
<p>Due to the Relocation of the Land Bureau to the City Center</p>
<p>Yao Wennan, the former Chief Director of the Land Survey Bureau, along with directors Qin Xitian, Hu Renfeng, Shen Zhou, Pan Liangshi, Li Hongzhu, Zhang Zongfu, Liu Donghai, and others, submitted a petition to the municipal government requesting that land ownership certificates be issued locally because the Land Bureau has moved to the city center, making it difficult for villagers to obtain their certificates. The original text is as follows: "It is heard that your government has moved to the city center, and all bureaus should follow. The plan for Greater Shanghai is admired by scholars and people. However, it is known that land occupation certificates in various rural areas are gradually completed, and the villagers must all go to the bureau to receive the certificates. The city center area is still remote. For those who are far from the rural areas, it is nearly a hundred miles away. Even for those who are nearby, it is thirty or forty miles away. There are rental boundaries in the middle, the roads are many, and the vehicles are mixed. The villagers who go to the bureau to receive certificates must be guided. They have to run around for a day to arrive. They can not return to the village on the same day, and the cost of food and accommodation is not less than three or four yuan. If the procedures are wrong, it will cost them several days and much more money. At this time of economic panic in the countryside, how can we allow this unexpected loss? According to the political system, it does not seem appropriate. For example, the households in the Caojing area who have not yet received certificates cannot get to the bureau on foot in less than three or four hours. When they get to the bureau gate, the policemen stand there, and they are afraid to look at them. The villagers are illiterate, and they run around blindly. Fortunately, a paper is thrown in, and they spend two or three hours starving and waiting for orders. It can be said that the time of one day's work has been completely consumed. If the grain certificate is incomplete, the contract does not match, or the single land does not match, they will go back and forth four or five times, spending dozens of yuan. By the time a certificate is in hand, the field price has lost seventy or eighty percent of its value. The villagers resent the directors and criticize them for being the culprits of evil. At the beginning of the directors' establishment of the land survey, their goal was to benefit the people, but today it has become a government that harms the people. Good causes lead to evil consequences, which is what the directors are heartbroken day and night. Moreover, the distance from Yangsi and other districts to the city center is several times farther than the distance from Caojing to the South Shanghai District. The people are limited in their strength. How can they bear this? Therefore, we dare to ask the mayor to order the director of the Land Bureau to appoint an appropriate official to meet with the municipal committee members of each district to issue the certificates locally, and properly handle any disputes, to save the villagers' financial resources and to relieve the directors' guilt. The villagers are fortunate, and the directors are also fortunate. After the Land Bureau moves north, please set up an office in the South Shanghai District so that the command can be prompt in the event of measurement and remeasurement. Officials and people will not be isolated, the cost is saved, and the effect is significant, not just to benefit the villagers. These are our humble opinions. We sincerely hope that you will adopt and implement them. We are very grateful."</p>

<p>Joint Promulgation by the Ministries of Finance and Law</p>
<p>The Ministries of Finance and Justice, considering that the current Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations have encountered many obstacles in their enforcement due to Article 4 of the Implementation Rules and Penalty Regulations, which stipulates that judicial organs' rulings regarding stamp tax penalties cannot be appealed, have jointly deliberated and amended the said rules. They have submitted the amendment to the Executive Yuan for forwarding to the National Government for record. The amended text is excerpted below: (Article 1) When judicial authorities discover or receive reports during the trial of lawsuits regarding matters of failure to affix stamps in accordance with the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations, they shall impose fines in accordance with the said regulations. (Article 2) Penalties imposed by judicial authorities under the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations shall be executed by rulings. (Article 3) When judicial authorities encounter violations of the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations by litigants, they shall impose penalties in accordance with the said regulations without delaying the progress of the lawsuit. (Article 4) Appeals against the rulings in Article 2 may be lodged with the competent higher court within five days. No further appeals shall be permitted against the court's ruling. (Article 5) Judicial authorities may stipulate a deadline for the payment of fines imposed under the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations. Failure to pay within the deadline shall result in compulsory execution. (Article 6) Fines imposed under the Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations, except for those reported by informers, who shall receive 40% as a reward, shall have 40% allocated to the judicial organ's operating expenses. The remainder shall be used to purchase judicial stamps and included under judicial revenue, with monthly reports made on the percentages of the aforementioned fines, based on the actual amount received. (Article 7) These rules shall come into effect from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3 id="e135">National Chamber of Commerce Federation Appeals to the Executive Yuan and Ministries to Return Fines Levied on Native Sugar from Qinzhou and Lianzhou <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>The Qinzhou and Lianzhou chambers of commerce in Guangdong province have jointly dispatched representatives, led by Pang Songhui, to petition in Beijing regarding the case of native sugar from Qinzhou and Lianzhou being transported to Shanghai, where the Jianghai Customs deemed it adulterated with foreign sugar and levied fines. Mr. Pang has already arrived in Shanghai and has sought assistance from the National Chamber of Commerce Federation and the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. The National Chamber of Commerce Federation, considering the matter to be of concern to the national sugar industry, has telegraphed the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Customs Administration, requesting them to uphold justice and redress the grievances. The original telegram is recorded below: To the esteemed Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, Ministry of Industry, and Customs Administration in Nanjing: We have recently received a joint letter from the Beihai Municipal Chamber of Commerce in Guangdong and the Hepu County Chamber of Commerce, stating that the Qinzhou and Lianzhou sugar merchant Guangyitang reported receiving letters from their counterparts Heli, Henghelong, Guangchanghe, and Heyi, stating that between July and September of this year, they transported native white sugar from Beihai to Shanghai a total of five times. Each time, they reported the goods to the Beihai Customs for inspection, confirming that it was pure native sugar and paying the transit tax in accordance with regulations before being allowed to proceed. Unexpectedly, upon direct arrival at Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs Tax Office completely detained the goods, claiming they contained 10% to 20% foreign sugar, and levied fines totaling 1,560 yuan and a supplementary tax of 1,957 yuan. The method used to distinguish between native and foreign sugar was without standards and prone to errors. The merchants have jointly submitted appeals and telegrams, but the matter has not been resolved after more than a month. The merchants are innocent and have suffered significant losses, forcing them to temporarily suspend business pending relief. Therefore, they have specially provided a list of fines levied on each merchant and requested verification. They implore you to forward the letter to the Beihai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the various Qinzhou and Lianzhou chambers of commerce, and request them to submit it to the Ministry of Finance and the Customs Administration, ordering the Jianghai Customs Tax Office to return the fines in full to demonstrate fairness. It is noted that Beihai is an important port for the export of Chinese native sugar, and the Beihai Customs is located close to the sugar-producing area. They have a clear understanding of the composition of native sugar and the differences between it and foreign sugar. Therefore, previous declarations of native sugar have always been inspected and released without error or difficulty. Now that the goods have been directly transported to Shanghai, the Jianghai Customs Tax Office claims they contain foreign sugar and levies substantial fines, clearly abusing their authority and undermining domestic products. If this is not stopped according to the law, how can farmers and merchants have peace of mind? Therefore, we have specially recorded the letter and forwarded it to you to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Upon approval, the association investigated and found that since the Jianghai Customs levied fines on native sugar, sugar merchants have suspended transport, incurring significant losses. Furthermore, the farmers and laborers in more than ten counties who rely on the sugar industry for their livelihoods are at risk of unemployment and bankruptcy. Their livelihoods and social order are all seriously affected. Based on the letter, we believe that the matter concerns the livelihoods of farmers and merchants in more than ten counties. Therefore, we have jointly convened the Hepu County Chamber of Commerce, sugar industry guilds, and all sugar merchants to discuss relief measures. A total of four resolutions were reached: (1) Request the Ministry of Finance to correct the erroneous methods used by the Jianghai Customs to distinguish between native and foreign sugar. (2) Request the Ministry of Finance to order the Jianghai Customs to release the native sugar of Beihai sugar merchants and return all past fines and supplementary taxes. (3) Request the Executive Yuan to instruct all customs offices nationwide to ensure the safety of native sugar exports and imports and not to deliberately create difficulties. (4) Request the Central Government to issue a clear order exempting native sugar from export and transit taxes and to establish export incentive measures for native sugar. These resolutions were unanimously passed and, in addition to telegrams and separate submissions, we have specially recorded the case and forwarded it to your association, and dispatched representative Pang Songhui to personally present the case. We implore you to provide effective assistance so that this case can be thoroughly resolved as soon as possible, which would not only benefit the Qinzhou and Lianzhou sugar industries but also the national industry. The representative Pang Songhui has also arrived at the association and provided further details, which have been approved. This case was previously received from the Haikou Municipal Chamber of Commerce in Guangdong, requesting forwarding to the association. The association has repeatedly telegraphed the case to the department without a response. Based on the letter, we hereby re-telegraphically submit it to your esteemed Executive Yuan for review and approval. We implore you to quickly order the Qionghai Customs to release the detained native sugar, return the collected fines, and exempt native sugar from export and transit taxes, in order to encourage domestic products and maintain the people's livelihood. This is our earnest prayer. [Signed] Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the Chamber of Commerce Federation of the Republic of China [Seal]</p>

<p>Surveys in Progress for Banking, Finance, and Other Industries</p>
<p>A Portion Could Be Completed This Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce is conducting commercial statistics in accordance with resolutions passed at past member conferences. The Chamber's Commerce Committee has planned and decided to prioritize ten industries in the first phase: banking and finance, rice, silk mills, coal, cotton cloth, yarn, woolen mills, sugar, and paper. Specialists have been selected to handle the task, aiming to complete the surveys within the year and begin compiling the statistics. According to a New Voice News Agency reporter's interview with the person in charge, survey forms for all ten industries have been distributed to the respective trade guilds for completion. It is reported that surveys for the banking and finance industries (including trust companies), as well as coal, yarn, and silk mill industries, are already underway. It is expected that a portion can be completed within the year. Although the large number of non-member firms in the cotton cloth industry makes it more difficult, the Chamber is making efforts to conduct the survey, with staff dispatched to assist. It is expected to be completed soon. Furthermore, the Chamber has contacted the persons in charge of the rice, sugar, paper, and woolen mill industries and will begin surveys soon.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Villagers of Jiangwan District Request Cessation of Contractor's Unauthorized Dike Demolition During Qiongjiang River Dredging <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Over fifty villagers, including Yin Fugen from Yuansha Lujiage in Jiangwan District, have petitioned the Jiangwan District Municipal Committee to forward their request to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works to cease the unauthorized demolition of dikes and private occupation of farmland by the contractor during the dredging of the river, which is harming farmland. The original text reads: "We, the villagers, have lived along the Qiongjiang River in Jiangwan for generations, earning our livelihoods through farming. All our farmland lies north and south of the Qiongjiang River. The Qiongjiang River connects to the Huangpu River in the south, and the tide ebbs and flows easily. Therefore, high dikes have been built on both banks to prevent flooding. During the two typhoons this autumn, the tide rose high, but our farmland was not flooded, thanks to the protection of the high dikes. Now, the contractor, under the pretext of dredging the Qiongjiang River, is arbitrarily demolishing the dikes and privately transporting the mud, not only damaging our property but also depriving the farmland on both sides of its protection, which is at risk of flooding at any time. The notice from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works states: 'It is noted that the land in the central district of the city is low-lying and in urgent need of soil to raise it for construction. The Yuansha Creek and the Qiongjiang River west of Songhu Road are suitable for dredging and extracting soil. The Bureau has contracted out the project, which will commence soon. Once this river is dredged, it will greatly facilitate transportation and irrigation, which is a win-win situation. The high soil on both sides of the Yuanchang River also needs to be leveled for cultivation. If there are losses to crops, it concerns major construction projects. All residents of both townships must not obstruct the project, lest there be inconvenience. This is hereby announced.' Therefore, the notice from the Bureau of Public Works only mentions dredging and soil extraction and does not mention demolishing the dikes. However, before the contractor has started the dredging project, they have set up tracks and seized the soil on both banks, intending to transport and sell it privately, which is clearly an act of encroaching on private property and harming farmland. Therefore, we appeal to the Municipal Committee to forward this request to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, ordering them to cease the demolition of the dikes and severely punish the foreman, in order to protect private property. This would be a virtuous act." It is reported that the District Municipal Committee has forwarded the above-mentioned dispute to the Municipal Bureau of Public Works for investigation and resolution.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Sudden Tragic Death of He Shiliang, Chief Comprador of Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Telegram Did Not Mention Details, Shanghai Office in Shock</p>
<p>He Shiliang, the chief comprador of Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong, had been in service for decades and was a leading figure among the Chinese merchants in Hong Kong. Yesterday, a sudden telegram from Hong Kong reported He Shiliang's tragic death. The circumstances were bizarre, and the Shanghai office was shocked upon receiving the news. Details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e141">Nephew of He Dong <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., a British firm, has its largest shipping and import-export business in Hong Kong, followed by Shanghai. The Chinese name of Jardine Matheson in Hong Kong is Zha Dian. Its large business and strong influence rank first among British firms. The chief comprador, He Shiliang, is the nephew of Sir He Dong, a wealthy gentleman in Hong Kong. When Jardine Matheson first started its shipping business in China, He Shiliang's grandfather was a partner in the business. He served as the Chinese manager, both as a shareholder and comprador. His descendants have inherited this position to this day. He Shiliang is the nephew of Sir He Dong and comes from a very wealthy family. He also holds a significant position in the Hong Kong commercial community.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Great Enterprise <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Jardine Matheson's granulated sugar is still widely sold in the Yangtze River basin and is very popular. He Shiliang's grandfather founded its sugar factory, which was later merged into Jardine Matheson. He Shiliang's father, He Fu, had a prominent reputation in Hong Kong. He Shiliang succeeded his father's position and expanded the business even further. He was involved in even more commercial activities. He had a relationship with most of the major commercial ventures in Hong Kong. As the chief comprador of Jardine Matheson, he handled his duties very well. Many of the staff working in the company are the children and relatives of the elite who had studied abroad. His brother, He Yuezhou, is in charge of the shipping business. He Shiliang is involved in many other businesses, but he mainly oversees them.</p>
<h3 id="e143">Shocking News <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>He Shiliang was over forty years old and a very handsome man. The Westerners at Jardine Matheson's head office relied on him and regarded him as an important leader in their Chinese operations. All the Chinese staff working on land and sea in the company obeyed and supported He Shiliang because he was always fair and impartial. Yesterday, the Shanghai office suddenly received an urgent telegram in English from Hong Kong. The translation only had a few words: "Hong Kong manager He Shiliang tragically died." No other details were provided. The senior management and compradores in the Shanghai office were saddened and filled with suspicion upon receiving the news.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Telegraphic Inquiry <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the senior management of Jardine Matheson in Shanghai telegraphed the Hong Kong office to inquire about the circumstances of He Shiliang's tragic death. It is still unclear whether his death was due to suicide or homicide. The truth will not be known until the reply telegram arrives in Shanghai. The company's Hong Kong liner will arrive in Shanghai on Sunday, and more information about this matter will be available then.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Various Rumors <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The reporter inquired about the cause of He Shiliang's death from various sources, but no one could confirm the truth of his tragic death. However, according to those who knew He Shiliang well, he had many private businesses in Hong Kong. This year, all industries have been in decline, and all of his businesses have been affected by the situation, suffering significant losses. As the end of the year approaches, He Shiliang's total losses have reached several million dollars, and he was unable to cover them. Therefore, he resorted to tragic death. However, it is difficult to say for sure whether this is the case. The truth will be known in a day or two. He Shiliang's death has also had a significant impact on the Hong Kong market.</p>

<p>There is only one pair of long-distance telephone lines between Beijing and Shanghai. It takes a long time to make calls, and many people are turned away during peak hours. To speed up communication, the Ministry of Transportation has added two pairs of long-distance telephone lines along the Beijing-Shanghai Highway. The project has already begun. It is reported that the lines have been extended to Kunshan, and telephone service is expected to be available in January next year. This will alleviate congestion.</p>

<p>Director of Zhejiang Construction Department Hosted Reporters in Shanghai Yesterday</p>
<p>Invited Them to Participate in the Ceremony and Tour Scenic Spots</p>
<p>The Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway in Zhejiang Province has now been completed, and a ceremony will be held in Jinhua on the 28th of this month. Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department, along with Wang Yingbin, Secretary of the Construction Department, and Du Zhenyuan, Director of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway Bureau, came to Shanghai and hosted a reception for the local press at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road yesterday afternoon. They reported on the construction of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and invited the press to participate in the opening ceremony and tour the scenic spots along the railway.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Guest List <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>The following guests attended: Ma Yinliang, Zhang Shutong, Zhao Junhao, Sun Daosheng, Jin Huating, Gu Angruo, Sun Enlin, Wang Boqi, Wang Zhongwei, Li Boyu, Wang Weizhen, Chen Dazai, Zhang Zhuping, Xiong Shaohao, Pan Gongbi, Xiang Yuancun, Chu Baoheng, Jiang Xiangqing, Liu Tong, Zheng Xitao, Wu Baoji, Dong Xian'guang, Pan Gongzhan, He Xiya, Xu Zhuodai, Guan Jian, Qian Cangshuo, Hu Hanzhu, Jiang Zongdao, Zeng Xubai, Chen Yaozhu, Wang Tiran, Cui Wanqiu, and Wang Zilian, Zheng Yaonan, Lu Meiseng, Yao Junwei and others, more than forty people from advertising industry.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Speeches by Hosts and Guests <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>During the reception, Director Zeng delivered a welcoming speech, stating that the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is 370 kilometers long, with rails weighing 35 pounds per yard and cars weighing 15 and 20 tons. It cost over 12 million yuan. Although the scale is small, the capital and design are all from Chinese sources, which is something to be proud of. The business prospects are also quite promising. Although there may not be immediate profits, it is safe to say that there will be no losses. The cost-effectiveness of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway has changed people's perception of railways. In the past, it was believed that it was difficult to make profits from railways, but now many others are following suit, such as the Wuhu-Zhejiang, Yuping, and Longyan-Zhangzhou railways, as well as the continued completion of the Hangzhou-Ningbo and Guangdong-Hankou railways. The colleagues are unsure whether the management of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway is appropriate and hope that the gentlemen can conduct on-site inspections and provide guidance so that we may follow. Furthermore, Zhejiang Province has magnificent scenery that is worth visiting. The gentlemen should take time out of their busy schedules to express their feelings. After the Fujian Incident, there have been rumors of tensions on the Zhejiang border. In reality, Zhejiang Province has a strict defense system and there is absolutely no cause for concern. The gentlemen will experience the reality of Zhejiang's tranquility and stability. Then, Zhang Zhuping gave a speech on behalf of the press to express his gratitude.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Planned Itinerary <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Finally, Secretary Wang reported on the itinerary for inviting the Shanghai press to participate in the ceremony. It is planned that on the 27th, they will travel by car from Shanghai along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway to Hangzhou and then take the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway to Jinhua to participate in the ceremony. Then, they will travel west by car to tour the entire railway line to Jiangshan. They are scheduled to return to Shanghai on the 31st. Those who cannot be away from Shanghai for a long time can return from Jinhua and arrive in Shanghai on the 29th. Travel, food, and accommodation along the way will be arranged by the Construction Department.</p>

<p>Court Prohibits Public Attendance</p>
<p>Trial Postponed to Next Year</p>
<p>Mrs. Xu Li, accompanied by her daughter Xu Yuying, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Ji Juemi for offenses against public morals. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, Judge Xiao Xiexun of the First Special District District Court held the trial in the Eighth Tribunal. The plaintiffs, mother and daughter, along with their lawyer Cao Yongsheng, and the defendants Ji Juemi and the second defendant, Mrs. Yu Xiaomei, and their lawyers Xue Dubi and Shan Yuhua, all arrived at the court with their respective representatives. The audience also flocked to the courtroom, causing it to be overcrowded. To maintain order, the authorities temporarily dispatched additional law enforcement officers, led by a police officer from the Western District, to the courtroom. They also stationed guards at the entrance to limit the number of people entering the court. Judge Xiao summoned both parties to the stand, separated them into plaintiff and defendant positions, and began the inquiry. After asking for their names, ages, birthplaces, addresses, and occupations, he immediately announced a ban on public attendance. He stated that the case involved public morals and should be closed to the public, including journalists. Therefore, the law enforcement officers and bailiffs maintaining order in the courtroom announced the court's order, requiring all those unrelated to the case to leave the courtroom. The audience withdrew like a tide. It was said that one or two people who intended to stay were persuaded to leave by the police officers. The atmosphere in the courtroom changed from tense to relaxed. However, later, some people took advantage of the judge's focus on questioning and quietly slipped back into the courtroom, standing in a corner and eavesdropping on the proceedings. The trial continued until dusk at 5:00 PM, when Judge Xiao adjourned the trial to continue on the afternoon of January 8th next year. Ji and the others then left in their cars. However, since public attendance was prohibited, the statements made by both the plaintiffs and defendants could not be learned and are omitted for now.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Tonghaili Water Cutoff Resolved <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>After negotiations, the company restored water supply</p>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, after the Tonghaili community on Tongzhou Road in Hongkou District had its main water pipe shut off by the water company on the 19th of this month, the 2,000 households were thrown into a panic. They requested the landlord, the Real Estate Department of the Land Reclamation Bank, to restore the water supply. The landlord, together with representatives of the tenants, petitioned the Public Works Department the day before yesterday. The representative He De Kui met with them and promised to relay the request to Director Zhong Shi for negotiations with the water company. After receiving the request, the water company sent staff to restore the water supply the day before yesterday (the 21st) afternoon. Yesterday's report stated that the tenants restored the water supply themselves, which is inaccurate. Yesterday, the water company sent a letter to the landlord, the Real Estate Department of the Land Reclamation Bank, stating that the water cutoff in the community was due to a misunderstanding and expressing its apologies. The water fees can also be discussed and paid through negotiations. Therefore, the water cutoff dispute in the community has been resolved. The Real Estate Association is now sending letters to its members to discuss digging artesian wells and having the water company collect the water fees directly, without the involvement of a third party, to avoid losses as before. The water fee of 7.5 yuan per 100 yuan of rent attached to the rent receipts can be deducted from the rent.</p>

<p>The Shipping Club at No. 10 Guangdong Road in Shanghai was founded by shipping leaders Yu Qiaqing and Yuan Ludeng. It is luxuriously equipped and has noble goals. It is reported that the newly built Tianjian Building will be inaugurated on the 24th of this month.

There will be gifts and a lucky draw for children, with prizes including various exquisite products from the Hollywood Mayflower Cosmetics Factory in the United States. It is said that the above arrangements were made by club members Chen Bogang and Mao Heyuan, who have been extremely busy recently. As of yesterday, over 200 Christmas dinners have been booked. Prominent figures in the shipping industry, such as Du Yuesheng, Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, and Li Shuxiong, have joined. It is expected that many distinguished guests will attend and make the event a great success.</p>
<h3 id="e156">Chang Yuting Plots to Harm Others <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Handwriting Analysis Reveals Extortion Letter Was Written by Yuting</p>
<p>Swallowing Brother's Property, Occupying Brother's Concubine, and Fabricating Facts to Frame Others</p>
<p>During the January 28th Incident last year, when Japanese invaders attacked Shanghai, there were many who willingly worked for the enemy as traitors. Chang Yuqing, the owner of the Daguan Garden Bathhouse in Beinicheng Bridge, Tianjin, was one of them. After the ceasefire, the government ordered his arrest, and it was difficult for him to stay in Shanghai. Therefore, he and his associates fled overseas. Chang Yuqing hid in Dalian, and his business in Shanghai was managed by his younger brother Yuting. On the 4th of this month, Yuting suddenly received a threatening letter and leaflets demanding 20,000 yuan. The letter stated that if the money was not paid, Yuting's photo would be published on the leaflets. Yuting initially took no action, but then received a second letter with stronger language, threatening that if the money was not paid within five days, he would be</p>
<h3 id="e157">Jade Pavilion Shot Dead <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The words "a letter was received shortly after, claiming that the previous two letters were written by Chang Yuqing's son-in-law, Zhang Xingran, and Luo Guangqi, a partner at the Grand View Garden. Yu Ting immediately reported this to the New Zha police station, which dispatched detectives to arrest Zhang and Luo, and searched their homes, finding draft letters and other items. They were handed over to the First Special District District Court. During the interrogation, both defendants completely denied the accusations, claiming that Chang Yuting was framing them. The court ordered an investigation and verification, as previously reported. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Tingqi opened the court, summoned witnesses, and continued the trial of the two defendants. First, the police lawyer Wang Yaotang detailed the police investigation procedures after the last court interrogation, stating that, in general,</p>
<h3 id="e158">Handwriting Comparison <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The result of the comparison showed that the threatening letters were not written by the defendants. However, the handwriting in the egg-shaped blank circles on the leaflets in the letters resembled that of the victim, Chang Yuting. Regarding the detailed circumstances of the handwriting comparison, it should be requested to question the person in charge, etc. Subsequently, Mei Yu, a handwriting expert from the Public Works Bureau Police Department, testified in court, detailing the appraisal process, stating that neither of the two threatening letters received by Chang Yuting was written by the defendants. However, the handwriting in the report letter received by Chang had many similarities with the threatening letters. The handwriting on the note that Chang submitted last time was the same as the writing in the egg-shaped blank circles on the leaflets attached to the threatening letters, etc. Judge Wu also examined the various</p>
<h3 id="e159">Written Evidence <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>in detail, and deemed Mei's report to be accurate. He then questioned the defendant Zhang Xingran, who testified that after my father-in-law, Chang Yuqing, left Shanghai, the positions in the three yarn factories, Fengtian, Dakang, and Tongxing, as well as the business of the Grand View Garden Bathhouse, were all handed over to Chang Yuting to manage on his behalf. However, Yuting harbored ulterior motives, not only plotting to seize the property but also engaging in adultery with my father-in-law's concubine, which was discovered by his own concubine, Wu Suqing. As a result, Wu divorced him. Unexpectedly, Yuting did not feel guilty but suspected that I was instigating it. Now, the positions in the three factories have been taken back by my mother-in-law, and he also suspects me of instigating this. Therefore, he</p>
<h3 id="e160">Schemed to Harm <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>Because Yuting has always been poor, and now the positions in the three factories have been taken back, and the Grand View Garden is heavily indebted and on the verge of bankruptcy, why would I demand extortion from him? This is a fabrication of the facts, and the circumstances are obvious. I request a clear investigation, etc. Luo Guangqi's testimony was roughly the same. At the end of the debate by the defense lawyers Fan Gang, Fan Qisheng, and Xuan Zhendong, Judge Wu acquitted the two defendants. The police lawyer Wang Yaotang stated that Chang Yuting should be held responsible for falsely accusing others and requested the court to allow the police to investigate according to law. The court held that this was within the police's authority and should be handled freely. It is said that the police will take action against Chang Yuting.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Convened a General Assembly for Public Lecture on Improving Chinese Bookkeeping <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>4 PM on the 24th</p>
<p>Location: Chamber of Commerce Meeting Hall</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce believes that accountant Xu Yongzuo's improved Chinese bookkeeping is a major contribution to accounting affairs in industry and commerce. It is specifically scheduled to hold a lecture on improved Chinese bookkeeping at 4 PM on the 24th of this month (i.e., Sunday) in the meeting hall, inviting accountant Xu to attend the lecture. The Chamber of Commerce has notified all trade associations in the city to inform their members of the improvements. The following is the correspondence between accountant Xu and the Chamber of Commerce:</p>
<p>Xu Yongzuo's letter to the Chamber of Commerce: Respected Sirs, the current bookkeeping methods in our country are broadly divided into Chinese and Western styles. Western bookkeeping, also known as new-style bookkeeping, uses horizontal writing, and relies on imported paper and ink. The accounting principles and methods are mostly confined to Western customs. Although Chinese characters can be used, numbers must be recorded in Arabic numerals. Its system and technology are too far from China's inherent habits. Not only is it difficult to imitate, but it may also make things more chaotic, and the costs are huge, neglecting the fundamentals for the sake of the trivial. Chinese bookkeeping, also known as old-style bookkeeping, uses vertical ledgers, and domestic paper and ink. The accounting principles and methods have been used for a long time, but unfortunately, the system and organization are generally lacking standards, resulting in frequent inversions and chaos. Although the cost is lower, it lacks a scientific spirit. Neither is suitable for general business circles. This accountant has served the community for many years and, lamenting the inadequacy of the current bookkeeping system, initiated a movement to improve Chinese bookkeeping. I have lectured at various universities and written articles in various journals, advocating improving Chinese bookkeeping based on our country's inherent system, adopting the latest theories in the world, and using the most economical and effective methods. The news has aroused sympathy from academic and business circles. In recent years, invitations from various schools to lecture have often been on the topic of improving Chinese bookkeeping, and commissions from various companies to design accounting systems have also been mostly on the topic of improving Chinese bookkeeping. It can be seen that improving Chinese bookkeeping has gradually moved from advocacy to implementation. Therefore, starting this year, I have devoted my spare time to designing improved Chinese bookkeeping schemes suitable for various industries and businesses. I have completed the planning and design of more than thirty types of improved Chinese accounting ledger forms, each with detailed explanations. I have also compiled a book entitled "Overview of Improved Chinese Bookkeeping" as a general explanation of the entire scheme, which has been handed over to the Standard Accounting Forms and Documents Sales Office for public sale to spread the word. Any new or old accounting staff can understand it after browsing. If there are any doubts, this office can also provide explanations. The paper is all domestic, and the records are all in Chinese characters. The savings in cost and convenience of procedures are not only far superior to Western styles but also exceed old-style bookkeeping. The detail and appropriateness of the accounting principles and methods, and the neatness and beauty of the accounting ledgers and forms, are especially unmatched by Western-style bookkeeping and old-style bookkeeping. In the contemporary accounting world, it seems to be the most economical and effective bookkeeping method. I have long admired your Chamber's leadership of the business community, and your words carry great weight. I would like to ask you to send a letter to all members, advocating its promotion, and asking various trade associations to inform various companies and firms to adopt and implement it to seek innovation in accounting matters. If you would invite me to give a public lecture at your Chamber at a set time, so that I can seek advice from experts, I would be especially grateful.</p>
<p>The Chamber of Commerce's reply to Xu Yongzuo: I have received your letter, stating that your book "Overview of Improved Chinese Bookkeeping" is beneficial to commercial accounting, with attached samples, and requesting that we introduce it to various industries for adoption. The Chamber has reviewed the contents of your letter. The style is detailed and practical, and it can be regarded as a major contribution to accounting. We will naturally promote it. We have scheduled an improved Chinese bookkeeping lecture at 4 PM on the 24th of this month in the meeting hall of this Chamber. At that time, we plan to invite you to attend the lecture and send additional samples of the book to the Chamber so that they can be publicly displayed for the public to browse on that day. In addition to notifying the shop members, association members, and commercial night schools in this city to inform their members to come to the meeting to listen to the lecture, we hereby reply accordingly. Please note, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e162">New Pharmaceutical Association Requests the Issuance of Flexible Certificates for Pharmacists <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>The China New Pharmaceutical Association submitted a document to the Department of Technical Health of the Ministry of Interior yesterday, stating that Article 2 of the Provisional Regulations for Pharmacists states in the second half, "Pharmacists, in addition to dispensing prescriptions from physicians, may manufacture, sell, or manage drugs." The words clearly indicate that dispensing prescriptions from physicians is the main task of pharmacists. Furthermore, Articles 11 to 16 of the same regulations provide detailed regulations for prescriptions, further proving that the previous statement is not speculation. Then the mission they bear is not as important as that of physicians. However, the qualifications stipulated in Article 3 are the same as those in Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Physicians. Moreover, physicians have the "Physician Flexible Certificate Issuance Measures" promulgated by the Ministry of Interior in 1932, which can be used to flexibly issue certificates, while pharmacists with a lighter mission cannot enjoy the same preferential treatment. If it is said that pharmacists have the right to manufacture prepared medicines, they can also directly put people to death. Leaving aside whether the manufacture of prepared medicines is the main task of pharmacists, even the production of a prepared medicine must comply with the provisions of Article 2 of the Regulations for the Management of Prepared Medicines, and may be sold only after submitting an application for inspection. It is far less risky than a physician who holds human life in their hands. There are only two pharmaceutical schools in the country, the private Sino-French University Pharmacy Department and the provincial Zhejiang Medical College Pharmacy Department. Each year, they train no more than 20 talents. There are also very few who study pharmacy abroad. For a country with such a vast territory as ours, it is indeed insufficient to allocate. (Omission) The Association believes that the matter concerns itself and cannot remain silent. Therefore, it has made the above statements to reach your ears. We sincerely request that you quickly issue measures for flexible certification for pharmacists.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Two Railways Improve Ticket Purchase and Luggage Transportation Procedures <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>North Station Ticket Office Open All Day for Ticket Sales</p>
<p>Luggage Transportation Procedures Also Improved</p>
<p>In order to facilitate passengers, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have decided to open the Shanghai North Station ticket office all day starting from New Year's Day next year to sell tickets for all trains and classes on the same day, so as to avoid crowding. They will also improve luggage transportation procedures. They have ordered the Transportation and Engineering Departments to make arrangements to implement this before the fifteenth day of the first month of the lunar year. The details are recorded below:</p>
<h3 id="e164">Ticket Office Changed to Open All Day <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai North Station ticket office of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways has a total of 22 ticket windows. The previous regulations stipulated that certain windows were dedicated to selling tickets between certain stations. This did not cause much difficulty for literate passengers, but for illiterate passengers, these 22 windows were like looking at the ocean and sighing, unable to choose. They often did not know which stations their desired station was between, and they felt particularly distressed when asking back and forth. In order to facilitate travel, the Railway Administration has decided to adopt the following principles and measures: (1) All ticket windows at all stations on the two lines will not be limited to selling tickets for certain stations. That is, passengers can purchase tickets to any station at any window. (2) All windows will be open for ticket sales all day and night, allowing passengers to purchase tickets for any class, any train, and any station at any time. (3) Tickets sold on the same day can be used on any equivalent train on the same day. (4) Stations with more windows are allowed to differentiate sales locations by ticket class. However, in any case, the number of windows selling third and fourth-class tickets cannot be less than eight-tenths of the total. (5) Ticket sellers will not be differentiated from each other. However, for the convenience of work, they can also be handled separately according to the specific circumstances of each station. The above items have been carefully planned by the Bureau and will be implemented from January 1, 1934.</p>
<h3 id="e165">Improved Luggage Ticket Procedures <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>In addition, the procedures for handling luggage transportation at the station are not very cumbersome, but the distance between the weighing area and the ticketing area is too far, and the communication in the work is not close enough, so it takes more time, which passengers often find inconvenient. The Railway Administration plans to reorganize the luggage room at the North Station, connecting the weighing area, accounting area, ticket writing area, and ticket issuing area together. When luggage enters the station, it will be picked up by porters and taken to the weighing area for weighing. Weighing will be done immediately, regardless of whether the passenger has purchased a passenger ticket. The luggage weighing ticket will be filled out immediately after weighing. After the luggage of a passenger is weighed, the passenger will be asked which class and how many passenger tickets they have, and this information will be filled out on the ticket. The person will then sign and be responsible for the ticket. The right-hand number strip of the ticket will be torn off and given to the passenger, and the left-hand side of the ticket will be thrown to the accounting area to calculate the price. It will then be handed over to the ticket writing area to fill out the luggage ticket, and the ticket will be issued at the window based on the passenger's number strip, and the fee will be collected. The Bureau has also ordered the Transportation and Engineering Departments to quickly make arrangements to implement this before January 15, 1934.</p>

(2) The water supply for the Sanli Houses costs 2,500 yuan per month and 30,000 yuan per year. It has been heard that various places are automatically drilling wells, each well costing about 10,000 yuan, and three wells costing a total of 30,000 yuan. This will be tried out in the Sanli Houses first. (3) In the future, when tenants move in, they will pay a deposit of two months' rent, which will be refunded after they move out.

<h3 id="e172">National Cotton Cloth Market Specifically Establishes Auction Venue <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Business Starts Today</p>
<p>The China National Cotton Cloth Market on Nanjing Road, Guizhou Road in this port is jointly organized by prominent figures in the business community of this port, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, Du Yuesheng, Hu Juewen, Zhang Zilian, etc. Since the start of business, business has been very developed. Recently, in order to enable the general public of direct consumers to enjoy universal benefits, the market has specifically established a national cotton cloth auction venue near the original site jointly by representatives of machine households. It is heard that it has now been organized and will start business on the 23rd of this month. All machine households that manufacture cotton cloth with pure national yarn can join the auction. It is heard that there are many kinds of cotton cloth that have joined, and the prices are especially low. In the past, shops and firms in this port and other ports used teahouses as collection points, the shares were complicated, and the order was very chaotic. Purchasing goods at the auction venue can eliminate the above-mentioned malpractices. Various cotton cloth shops and firms should be happy to hear this news.</p>

<p>Preventing Cutthroat Competition and Maintaining National Products</p>
<p>The Clock and Watch Industry Association sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating that the Association previously found that the prices of national clocks were inconsistent, leading to increasingly fierce cutthroat competition.

Therefore, it convened the Shanghai wholesale outlets of Yantai Deshunxing, Yongye, and Yongkang, and the Shanghai factories of Dean, Changming, Shanghai, etc., and delegated representatives to form a national clock pricing committee to set prices for various clocks. Subsequently, the committee replied that the prices of national clocks had been drafted and requested a review and approval, along with a price list. The 57th meeting of the Executive Committee reviewed the price list and resolved to print and distribute it to various factories and require compliance from this month onwards. Otherwise, it will be handled in accordance with the Association's regulations. In addition to submitting it to the Social Affairs Bureau for record, we enclose a copy of the clock price list for your Chamber's reference. The price list is as follows: A.

<h3 id="e176">Appeals from the Leather Tobacco Industry Association <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Leather Tobacco Industry Association submitted a document to the Ministry of Finance, stating that it was submitting a report regarding the illegal collection of taxes on shredded tobacco produced from Fujian native tobacco leaves within the seven special zones. They earnestly requested a swift cessation of this practice to resolve disputes and stabilize commerce. It was found that Article 7 of the Provisional Regulations for the Collection of Special Tax on Native Tobacco, as approved by the National Government, stipulated that shredded tobacco made from native tobacco leaves for smoking would be temporarily exempt from tobacco tax. Furthermore, Article 5 of the Rules for the Inspection and Collection of Native Tobacco Leaves also stipulated that tobacco shreds were temporarily exempt from taxation in the special zones. Therefore, the association's tobacco shreds, originating from Fujian, should not be subject to taxation, regardless of whether they were imported via Xiamen or Shantou. However, the Tax Administration and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol violated the regulations by demanding supplementary tax collection on the processed tobacco shreds, citing the lack of new tax implementation and insufficient old tax payments in Fujian Province. They did not seek tax collection at the fundamental level of native tobacco leaves. Instead, they enforced supplementary taxes on the processed shredded tobacco, establishing four provisional supplementary and refund tax measures: (1) Fujian leather tobacco shreds shipped to Shanghai between July 1, 1933, and October 31, 1933, would be subject to a special tobacco leaf tax of four yuan, one jiao, and five fen per hundred market catties, but each package (equivalent to 67 market catties) would be eligible for a two-yuan refund of the old tax. (2) Starting from November 1st of this year until the date of the special tax implementation in Fujian or the implementation of supplementary taxes in Minhou, Fujian leather tobacco shreds shipped from Shantou to Shanghai must have proof of old tax payment, and those verified would still be eligible for the tax refund under the first measure. Without proof, the new regulations for special tobacco leaf tax, charging four yuan, one jiao, and five fen per hundred market catties, would apply. (3) Shanghai was designated as the general supplementary tax zone. After supplementary tax payments in Shanghai, the goods could be transported to the mainland for retail without further inspection. In other locations, Fujian leather tobacco shreds sent via postal parcels should be subject to supplementary and refund tax payments by the local tobacco and alcohol special tax sub-bureaus based on the previous measures. (4) A tax payment certificate should be issued for both supplementary taxes paid in Shanghai and elsewhere, and the certificate should be stamped with the phrase "Tax Supplemented, Certificate Canceled" for separate filing and verification. The tobacco merchants reluctantly complied with these temporary measures. Subsequently, Zhangzhou, Fujian, implemented the special tax, and the association was preparing to request the Tax Administration to strictly implement the seventh article regarding tobacco shred tax exemption. Unexpectedly, the Tax Administration intensified its actions, using the excuse that the special tax on native tobacco leaves in Fujian Province had not yet been implemented. From December 7th, regardless of whether the goods came from Xiamen or Shantou, and whether they had new or old tax certificates, they would be treated as goods entering the special zone from non-special zones, requiring another payment of special tax. This intransigence, contradictory wording, and inconsistency made it difficult for merchants to accept. According to Article 5 of the Special Tax Regulations, Fujian Province was designated as a special tax zone. How could it be compared to non-special tax zones? Moreover, Fujian Province has already implemented the special tax, with special tax payment certificates to prove it (attached). It should not be dismissed entirely. As for the recent lack of tax revenue in Fujian Province, that is a matter of government administration and unrelated to the merchants. Furthermore, the industry has been affected by frequent banditry for years, and foreign cigarettes have severely impacted the market. The small domestic businesses are on the verge of bankruptcy, and hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in the bandit-stricken areas are about to die. If taxes are repeatedly imposed, it would be equivalent to draining the pond to catch the fish. In this time of internal and external difficulties, when the government is trying to remedy the people's livelihood, how should it alleviate the suffering of merchants, support domestic goods, and preserve them? Instead, the Tax Administration is acting in reverse, arbitrarily destroying the industry. Even if they are not considering the merchants, they should protect the tax regulations approved by the National Government. How can they act arbitrarily, disregarding the lives and deaths of merchants and treating the national tax laws as trifles? The entire association of merchants believes that this matter is critical. They cannot accept the illegal collection of tobacco shred tax. They hereby submit a report, earnestly requesting your ministry to swiftly order the Tax Administration and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax Bureau for Tobacco and Alcohol to cease the collection of taxes on Fujian tobacco shreds within the special zones to resolve disputes and stabilize commerce. We await your urgent order. Respectfully submitted to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance. (Attached: Special Tax Payment Certificate for Native Tobacco Leaves from Zhangzhou, Fujian). Respectfully submitted by Lai Zhenhuan, Lu Yunwu, and Jiang Buyun of the Shanghai Leather Tobacco Industry Association.</p>

It is reported that the revised automobile donation rates have been approved by the Municipal Government and will be implemented on January 1, 1934. (Attached table)</p>

<p>Only After Cohabitation Does She Discover Her Husband Has a Wife</p>
<p>Now Being Prosecuted for Bigamy and Assault</p>
<p>Wu Dai, an elderly woman from Changzhou, is 72 years old and lives in the countryside. She has a son and a daughter. Her son, Jingxiu, is a businessman in Shanghai. Her daughter, Suzhen, is 32 years old and of modest beauty. She married Chen Zicheng, a fellow villager. In the autumn of this year, she came to Shanghai to find work as a factory worker and stayed with Shen Meiying, a fellow villager, in the French Concession. Shen is living with Zhang Huaifu, also known as Zhang Laoer, a local man. Zhang works in a flower shop and is friends with Chen Jinding (44 years old), who is in the same industry. Chen operates his own Yunlong Flower Shop at No. 45, the intersection of Avenue du Père Froc and Route de Say Zoong in the French Concession. He has a wife and family in the countryside who take care of the farmland. Because Chen lives alone in Shanghai, he is looking for a companion to alleviate his loneliness as a traveler. He often visits Zhang's house and becomes acquainted with Suzhen. On the afternoon of September 6, Shen Meiying and Zhang Huaifu invited Suzhen to watch a movie at the Empire Theater on Avenue Joffre. Chen was also at the theater and met Shen, Zhang, and Suzhen. Chen thought Suzhen was attractive and developed affection for her. After the movie, Chen invited Shen, Zhang, Suzhen, and others to a friend's house nearby for a rest. They went to the Tiansheng Hotel in Baixianqiao. They entered through the back door, booked a room, and colluded with Shen and Zhang to order wine and dishes to entertain Suzhen. Suzhen was unsuspecting and fell into their trap. After getting her drunk, Shen and Zhang left together. Chen then had sexual intercourse with Suzhen overnight. Afterward, Chen told Suzhen that he had no wife and asked her to marry him and live together. He also wrote a note for Suzhen, stating that if he abandoned her or committed bigamy, he would be responsible for her support. Suzhen was still hesitating when her husband learned of the matter in Shanghai and immediately wrote an agreement to divorce Suzhen. At this point, Suzhen had nowhere to go, and what was done was done, so she accepted Chen's proposal. On October 28, the two held a wedding ceremony at the Hexinglou Restaurant on Chongqing Road, with Wang Changfa as the witness. After the marriage and cohabitation began, Chen often told Suzhen that he had a wife in Shanghai and a concubine at home. Suzhen thought he was joking, but she recently learned that Chen did indeed have a wife at home. She confronted Chen, but he beat her. He then abandoned her and did not provide for her daily expenses. Suzhen believed that Chen's behavior was so violent and that he had colluded to deceive her into marriage. She could not live with him and grow old together. She informed her brother, Jingxiu, who sent for their elderly mother, Dai, to come to Shanghai. They hired lawyers Xu Wu and Zhang Deyou to file a criminal complaint against Chen and Shen Meiying and Zhang Huaifu in the Second Special District Court for fraud, bigamy, and assault, requesting imprisonment, and also filed a civil suit to recover 10,140 yuan in alimony, calculated at 30 yuan per month for 28 years and two months. Wang Zuifa was called as a witness. After the court received the complaint and served it, the defendant, Chen Jinding, hired lawyer Shen Yiqian to defend him. He submitted a response and filed a counterclaim against Wu Suzhen, Wu Jingxiu, and Wu Dai for colluding to frame him. He stated that in July of this year, the defendant hosted a Mid-Autumn Festival banquet at home and invited guests. Suzhen and Zhang Huaifu came to eat and became acquainted. Suzhen knew that the defendant had a wife. Suzhen's brother, Jingxiu, said that Suzhen was having difficulty with food and clothing and was willing to be the defendant's concubine. After Jingxiu discussed the matter at the hotel, they rented No. 102 Pushi Road and lived together. Jingxiu also said that they had to hold a banquet to save face. Jingxiu wrote a draft invitation and printed it, but the defendant could not read and did not understand that he had written "remarriage" on the invitation, intending to blackmail him. No wedding ceremony was held at Hexinglou. After cohabitation, he bought Suzhen clothes and accessories worth more than 180 yuan. Jingxiu also borrowed 60 yuan. On October 7, Suzhen took the clothes and left without saying goodbye. She came back on the 9th. After the defendant scolded Suzhen, she reported him to the police for assault. The police did not accept the case. She also colluded with her mother to file a complaint. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Fanglian summoned both parties and witnesses to the Criminal Court No. 2 for questioning and instructed them to wait for a later date for further questioning.</p>

<p>The Soybean and Rice Industry Association stated that in the past two years, the amount of rice shipped from various producing areas to Shanghai has been extremely prosperous. The rice all comes from boatmen, and the arriving rice boats dock at the association's own wharf to unload. The wharf was originally intended for rice boats to dock and unload, but in recent years, boats carrying miscellaneous grains and oil cakes have also docked there because the loading and unloading is convenient, resulting in a lack of docking space on the wharf. Disputes often occur as boats compete to unload. The association stated that the miscellaneous grains and oil cake boats also belong to the association's members, so they have added a wharf to the north of the original Xuejiajia wharf and have built a three-story steel-concrete warehouse along the bank, specifically to store soybeans, rice, and miscellaneous grains, so that the cargo ships can unload as soon as they arrive, avoiding congestion. The added wharf is currently being designed and implemented. The warehouse was contracted by the Jiuji Construction Company this spring and is being built day and night. It has now been completed. The opening ceremony was held the other day.

<h3 id="e201">Export <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Ling</p>
<p>When China is mentioned, one invariably and naturally thinks of its vast territory and abundant resources. Although the four northeastern provinces are no longer ours, when China is mentioned, one still inevitably thinks of its vast territory and abundant resources.</p>
<p>Speaking of vast territory and abundant resources, I find it very contradictory. According to customs reports, since the establishment of customs, there has not been a single year in which exports exceeded imports. Whether it is food, drink, clothing, daily necessities, reading materials, viewing materials, transportation, or various industrial raw materials, we all rely on imported goods. From this, we should slap ourselves in the face and ask: "Are resources abundant?"</p>
<p>In such a large China, the only things that are shipped overseas, to put it bluntly, are "silk" and "tea." Let's not even talk about the decline of the silk and tea trade in recent years. Even during the peak sales period, there was never any direct trade with foreign markets. It was just doing some small-scale business with the import and export foreign firms stationed in China. If foreign merchants did not come to China to do this trading business, it would be pitiful. Although China has a vast territory and abundant resources, the world markets might not have discovered Chinese silk and tea.</p>
<p>This is not the author exaggerating; it is indeed the case. To put it more bluntly, there are many more examples. If foreign ships did not play the trick of bringing in yellow croaker, there would definitely not be so many Qingtian peddlers in Europe today. If Western missionaries had not introduced the Chinese golden lotus and pigtails, etc., the civilization of the ancient oriental country to the world, perhaps Westerners would still not be familiar with the situation in China. Everyone, please think about it. These things cannot be directly exported by ourselves and have to rely on others. How can we talk about formal commodities?</p>
<p>However, recently there is a plan for "Chinese fruits to be directly shipped overseas." Wonderful! This may be due to entering the next Yuan cycle, so we can finally raise our heads and start the first record of Chinese exports. This is naturally a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. How can I not be overjoyed? However, I hope that the fruit merchants will work hard to open up a direct export route for China, with its vast territory and abundant resources, and not allow foreign consumers to confirm that "these are products of an inferior nation." Otherwise, alas, I can't bear to say it.</p>
<h3 id="e202">"Filial Sons Come from Under the Stick" <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Haowu</p>
<p>Ever since Washington Irving said, "Spare the rod and spoil the child," the Chinese "philosophers" who have always advocated "filial sons come from under the stick" can "quote the classics" and say arrogantly: "I am not alone!"</p>
<p>Indeed, young children are ignorant and easily indulge their emotions. As parents, standing in the position of nurturing and supervising, they should strictly guide and restrain them to fulfill their responsibilities as parents. However, the reality is often "off-topic."</p>
<p>I have personally seen a little girl. Her tattered clothes, sallow skin, thin muscles, and swollen face, needless to say, at a glance, one knows that she was not born to enjoy the blessings of wealthy parents. Often her little cheeks are puffed up, her little lips are closed, and her little eyebrows are slightly furrowed. She can sit there for several hours without moving or making a sound. Unless someone asks her, she will answer a word or two. If you ask her to move around, I can't say she doesn't move. Hey! How can she not move? However, her feet move and her hands sway, always slowly, mechanically, and weakly. Don't say lively and innocent, even the minimum of liveliness is really hard to find!</p>
<p>People say to me behind my back: "Her parents are really fierce! Saying too much will get you beaten; not listening will get you beaten; even if nothing is wrong, they will lose their temper and beat her! Beat! Beat! Beat!"</p>
<p>Thinking carefully, her mother is still her biological mother. Feeling pain for her own flesh, she may sometimes have regrets. What about those poor children who lost their mothers early and live under the tyrannical power of their stepmothers all day long? Wearing a reed flower padded jacket, which seems so light, soft, and thick to outsiders, and the stepmother seems so gentle and loving; in reality? Enduring sorrow and bitterness, swallowing tears. There is no shortage of people who have experienced it firsthand, so why should I, who have not experienced it, "scratch the itch from outside the boot?"</p>
<p>The problem here is no longer whether the family circumstances are spacious or not. The reality is like this, and the customs have continued like this. Otherwise, it would not be a "famous" "stepmother"!</p>
<p>Let me put aside those virtuous parents who are ignorant of indulgence. Even those parents who use "restraint" to whip and beat, and use whipping and beating to bury their children's happiness, extinguish their children's innocence, shackle their children's freedom, and deeply engrave the images of human cruelty, violence, and viciousness on their pure little hearts, thus leaving the root of misanthropy, although their heart of cultivating "filial sons" is commendable, I am afraid there will be some criticism ("There are no wrong parents in the world," crazy words deserve a beating!). Fortunately, there is still "legacy" to follow!</p>
<h3 id="e203">Friends! Remember <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— One</p>
<p>Friends! Remember: When you read domestic current affairs and see the word "have," you should read it as the word "none." It is best to look at the newspaper upside down. Otherwise, prepare tiger balm in advance; be careful of your stomach.</p>
<p>Friends, remember: Crying is something that belongs to the poor, and laughing is something that belongs to the rich.</p>
<p>Friends! Remember: Today's panacea for a prosperous world is "flattery" and "experience."</p>
<p>Friends! Remember: With money, there is power. So all the rich are "benevolent and righteous."</p>
<p>Friends, remember: The future is even more vague than looking at the vast sea where the water connects to the sky and the sky connects to the water.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Special Goodnight <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Rong Yu</p>
<p>"Wish you a good night!" Although this is a common polite greeting, when the other person puts on a kind smile and speaks in a gentle tone, you will not feel completely comfortable, but you will certainly not be disgusted. Because when he says good night to you, it always contains some respect.</p>
<p>However, people who live in Shanghai have another special goodnight, please accept it. This kind of goodnight is hideous, rude, and also requires you to pay a considerable price to them.</p>
<p>The big clock at the customs struck two o'clock. At this time, the road was quiet, with only a few rickshaws dragging along listlessly, and the food stalls flickering with phosphorescent lights. The wealthy gentlemen and ladies were either just finishing their drunken songs or returning from dancing. If you took a motorcycle or lived in a lively area, of course, there would be no accidents on the way back. But if you took a rickshaw or walked, and your home was on a remote road, in this cold wind and dim light, a few burly men would jump out from the side and block your way. They would point a shiny black pistol at your vitals and say, "Hey! Friend, be sensible, don't make a sound!"</p>
<p>If you are a beautiful friend, let them do as they please, confiscate your purse, and take off your clothes. Let them leave triumphantly, and you can only admit your bad luck. If you are not sensible and shout loudly, before the detectives arrive, you will be beaten, which is not worth it. So, when you meet someone who says a special goodnight to you, you can only accept it obediently and pay the price quickly. Other than that, what other way is there to think of?</p>
<p>One day, my relative, Mr. So-and-so, also encountered someone saying a special goodnight. Because he didn't have any money with him, the few people who said goodnight were very frustrated. In addition to confiscating his clothes, they also stripped off his shiny leather shoes, forcing him to walk home in his socks.</p>
<p>Another time, two female guests were taking a rickshaw home when they also encountered a few people saying goodnight on the way. They also knew that "men and women are different" and did not search them. One didn't have any cash, so she lost a wool coat. The other lost a handbag containing a dozen silver dollars. Afterwards, they said, "If these people who said goodnight had searched them carefully, they would have found dozens of yuan in banknotes in their tight-fitting pockets!"</p>
<p>"Stripping the pig." Imagine encountering such thugs on the road. In addition to losing clothes and money, you also have to endure abuse. Isn't that a double loss? So I propose that the phrase "stripping the pig" be abolished. Anyone who has received this kind of blessing will definitely agree!</p>

<p>Chapter 20: The Old Man Smiles for Days at a Fortunate Date, The Old Friends Live Across the Street and Their Worries are Endless</p>
<p>He sacrificed a lot for me, and he even swore that he would not return to his brother's house until he made a fortune. Now that he hasn't made a fortune, why has he returned to his brother's house? Could it be that this is also for my sake? If this is also for my sake, what can I use to comfort him? It's so embarrassing to see him. It would be boring to comfort him with a few nice words, and it would also raise a lot of suspicion. Furthermore, even if I comfort him, telling him not to take me to heart, it seems to me that it would be better not to comfort him at all. If I did comfort him, I'm afraid he would miss me even more. With this thought, Guizhi decided to ignore Second Master Gan. When it was time to sleep at night, she remembered that there was a photo of Ji Zhi in her pillowcase. This thing, keeping it by her side, would cause trouble sooner or later, and it would always cause trouble, disturbing her thoughts. It would be better to put it in a place where she would never see it. But after her mother fell asleep, when she touched the photo, it was not in the pillowcase, but on the mattress, covered by the pillow. She remembered clearly that she had put it in the pillowcase, so why had it changed places? Could it be that her mother had seen it? If her mother had seen it, it would show that she still had divided loyalties. Her mother was a conservative person, so she would look down on her even more. At that time, there were no lights in the room, and she didn't dare to light a fire. In the dark, she threw the photo into the crack in the kang, planning to wait until her mother was not at home to find a proper place to store it. That night, with this heavy thought added to her mind, she tossed and turned and couldn't sleep. Naturally, she woke up even later the next day. When she opened her eyes, she saw her mother with a cigarette in her mouth, sitting diagonally on a square stool by the door. Her mother was a non-smoker, which she knew. This was also extremely uncomfortable in her heart, so she was smoking there to relieve boredom and think about things. This might have something to do with the photo under the pillow? (275)</p>

<h3 id="e206">The Importance of Modulation <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Huayu</p>
<p>Why do we need to pay attention to the modulation when listening to distant broadcasting stations? It turns out that the loudness of the sound received from distant radio stations is greatly related to the modulation component. Because the loudness is directly proportional to the square of the electric field strength and the modulation. Now let L represent the original loudness, F be the electric field strength, and M be the modulation, then the formula is as follows:</p>
<p>F² × M = L</p>
<p>For example, when we receive a distant radio station, its modulation is assumed to be 33⅓%. When receiving another distant radio station, the modulation is 66⅔%. If the power of the two radio stations is equal, then the sound we receive from the former is only half as loud as the latter. Therefore, we can see from the above formula that the loudness of the sound received from distant radio stations is indeed related to its power, but the modulation is also very important, and modulation is even more important than power! Because only the square of F is directly proportional to L.</p>
<p>Now suppose there are two distant radio stations A and B. The F of radio station A is 0.002 volts per meter (Millivolt/Meter), and the modulation is 50%. The F of radio station B is 0.0015 volts per meter, and M = 80%. What is the ratio of the sound loudness we receive? It is very easy to calculate according to the above formula.</p>
<p>Radio Station A: 0.002² × 0.5 = 0.000002</p>
<p>Radio Station B: 0.0015² × 0.8 = 0.0000018</p>
<p>The ratio of L is 0.0000024 : 0.0000018 = 4 : 3</p>
<p>For example, the F of radio station C is 0.0007 volts per meter, and the modulation is 100%; the E of radio station D is 0.0005 volts per meter, and the modulation is 50%. Then,</p>
<p>Radio Station C: 0.0007² × 1.0 = 0.00000049</p>
<p>Radio Station D: 0.0005² × 0.5 = 0.000000125</p>
<p>The ratio of F of the two radio stations is 7:5, and the ratio of L is 4:1. The two ratios obtained above show the reason why modulation is more important than power. Therefore, if the modulation percentage of a powerful radio station is not enough, although the power is strong, it will not have good results.</p>

<p>The circuit on the left is a transceiver. The circuit adopts magnetic feedback. The power is taken from AC. The high voltage must be wound with 180 volts and 90 volts</p>
<p>(First picture) at both ends (see Figure 1). Use 90 volts for receiving</p>
<p>and 180 volts for transmitting, because there is still considerable loss after rectification and filtering. According to the author's actual experiment, the machine can be used to receive extremely loud sounds with a single-tube machine more than ten houses away when transmitting at midnight. If you want to know whether the oscillation and sensitivity are good, you can connect a small 2.5-volt bulb in series in the antenna circuit L (as shown in Figure ×). When the feedback force is adjusted to the optimum, the bulb will emit a slightly red and pulsating light pressure when speaking into the microphone. T in the figure is a dual-purpose transformer. Take a low-tone transformer (three to one). First, take out its iron core, and add 400 turns of No. 30 enameled wire on the (original coil PBGF) as the primary of the microphone transformer. The PB ends are used as the primary of the pickup (as shown in Figure 2). Oscillation</p>

<h3 id="e208">Calculation of Triode Power Output and Distortion <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Yizhi</p>
<p>The power output and distortion of a triode cannot exceed its characteristic fixed value, otherwise the sound reproduction will be blurred. Therefore, when using a triode for amplification, its output power and distortion should be calculated first to avoid excessive output and distortion. Now, each vacuum tube manufacturer attaches its characteristic table to the vacuum tube sold for inspection, which can save calculation. However, we should know its calculation method. If the power output and distortion of the vacuum tube are not noted, we can calculate to obtain it.</p>
<p>When the gate of the vacuum tube is stimulated by the AC peak voltage of the input signal, if it is a positive half-wave, it will be equal to zero from the gate position; if it is stimulated by a negative half-wave, it will become twice the original value from the gate position. Therefore, gate voltage stimulation indicates the maximum and minimum voltages and currents. The power output can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p>Power Output = (Maximum Current - Minimum Current) × (Maximum Current - Minimum Current) ÷ 8</p>
<p>The percentage of second harmonic distortion can be calculated using the following formula:</p>
<p>Second Harmonic Distortion = (Maximum Current + Minimum Current - Load Current) ÷ 2 ÷ (Maximum Current - Minimum Current) × 100</p>
<p>For example: The screen voltage of a certain triode is 250 volts, the screen current is 34 milliamps, the gate voltage is 50 volts, and the load resistance is 3900 ohms. The characteristic curve of its screen voltage and screen current EP IP is shown in the figure. Find its power output and distortion value.</p>
<p>Solution: Draw a straight line Xy parallel to AB through point P in the figure (that is, the intersection of the gate voltage 50 volts and the screen voltage 250 volts should have a current of 34 milliamps). The AB line is drawn between points M and O. Point M is the intersection of the screen voltage 250 volts and the screen current zero amps. Point Q is the intersection of the screen voltage zero volts and the screen current is equal to the quotient obtained by dividing the screen voltage 250 volts by the screen resistance of 3900 ohms. The quotient is: 25 ÷ 390 = 0.064 amps, which can be used to calculate the following formula:</p>
<p>Power Output = (0.066 - 0.007) × (0.066 - 0.007) ÷ 8 = 0.000434925 Watts</p>
<p>The harmonic distortion can be obtained by the formula:</p>
<p>Second Harmonic Distortion = (0.066 + 0.007 - (2 ÷ 0.066 - 0.007)) × 100 = 4.2%</p>
<p>The distortion of the vacuum tube must not exceed 5%, and its load resistance at the best operating point is about twice the screen resistance. These two problems are very important on the vacuum tube, so they are attached.</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Ratio of Electricity to Volume丨The Meaning of Decibel丨 <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Li Yuanqing</p>
<p>Calculating the relationship between two ordinary objects is generally very simple. For example, if one battery costs one yuan, then two yuan can buy two batteries, and five yuan can buy five batteries… In short, spending a certain amount of money buys the same amount of batteries. This kind of regular change is called a linear ratio in mathematics.</p>
<p>However, in radio, the relationship between volume and electricity is not so simple. For example, if the power of a radio is increased by half, the change in output volume is almost imperceptible to the average person. Doubling the power of a radio only results in a slight change in volume. In fact, it takes four times the power of a radio to achieve twice the volume.</p>
<p>We know that sound waves are produced by the vibration of objects. A larger vibration force results in larger sound waves, and a smaller vibration force results in smaller sound waves. However, the change in the magnitude of the vibration force and the strength of the sound waves is irregular — it is not a linear ratio, but a logarithmic ratio.</p>
<p>The method commonly used to calculate the ratio of electricity to volume is the Bel system. In the Bel system, a tenfold increase in electricity corresponds to a one Bel increase in volume. However, in radio engineering, it is rare to increase electricity by a factor of ten or a hundred, so one Bel is too large for practical use. Therefore, one Bel is divided into ten smaller Bels — each smaller Bel (Decibel) is equal to one-tenth of a Bel.</p>
<p>According to the ordinary situation, ten times the electricity can get ten decibels (that is, one Bel), then, four times the electricity can only get four decibels; two times the electricity, can only get two decibels. But in fact, it is not like this!</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the relationship between electricity and volume is a logarithmic ratio. Thus, it is known that the Bel changes according to the logarithm of the "power multiple." Expressed as a formula, it is: Bel 10gP1 - P2</p>
<p>Decibel 10 10gP1P2 (P1 first power) (P2 second power)</p>
<p>For example, if the output power of a radio is originally 200 milliwatts (P1), and is now increased to 400 milliwatts (P2), according to the above formula, we get:</p>
<p>Decibel = 10 10g400 - 200 = 10 10g2 = 10X.3 = 3 (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Zhu Ziyuan</p>
<p>I once assembled a three-circuit single-tube radio, using an R.C.A.-30 tube, a B battery of 45 volts, and adjusting the feedback force with a variable feedback coil. Because I felt the effect was already good, I did not install a bypass capacitor. Unexpectedly, when listening with headphones, touching the headphone wires would cause a loud squeal, and the same problem would occur when a person approached. Later, I had to connect a 0.002 fixed capacitor between the headphone end of the feedback coil and A-B, and connect A-B to ground. This problem was completely resolved, the feedback force was greatly strengthened, and the sound quality was clearer. If the adjustment of the feedback force is not stable when using the feedback coil, then the 0.002 fixed capacitor can be replaced with a 0.00025 variable capacitor, and the problem can be avoided. The adjustment of regeneration will be much smoother.</p>

<p>If you don't use specially made silicon steel sheets with high permeability to make a power transformer, you can use good, flat wrought iron sheets (because wrought iron also has very high permeability). Cut them into a 日 shape, and then coat them with shellac (i.e., shellac dissolved in alcohol, which is sold in paint stores or instrument shops). This thinned solution reduces eddy current loss and can be used as the core, with very good results.</p>

<p>▲Discussion Content Includes Service, Training, and Examination of Normal School Students (Jinan Express) The Shandong Department of Education was ordered to handle the Normal School Society Examination matters and decided to convene a conference of principals of normal schools throughout the province to discuss issues such as examinations and service of graduating students.

The principals attending included Chang Zizhong (Sixth Rural Normal), Sun Dongge (Linqing Six County Joint Normal), Zhang Shujiao (Teng County County Normal), Wang Zhiheng (Gaoyuan Five County Joint Normal), Chen Jie (Cao County County Normal), Li Jingtang (Dingtao County Normal), Yang Weikun (Jining Four County Joint Normal), Wang Guanying (Eighth Rural Normal), Cao Lanzhen (Third Rural Normal), Xiong Xiushan (Fifth Rural Normal), Sheng Zhendong (First</p>

After the opening ceremony,</p>
<p>▲He Siyuan delivered a speech, roughly saying that the discussion at today's conference of principals will focus on the following three points: first, how normal school students can serve; second, how to train them; and third, how to examine them. We know that in the past, service was limited to schools, because in the past (Qing Dynasty), there were limited numbers of Xiucai and Juren, which restricted education. Now the purpose of education is universal education. However, although the current system has changed, the students' mentality of seeking education and making a fortune still exists, and society's expectations have not changed, still clinging to the gentry concept. In today's society, we should especially move towards productive education and survival education. All of this should start with normal school education. The old concept of simply eliminating illiteracy is not a fundamental solution, because literacy is only a tool, not the goal. Having knowledge does not necessarily mean being literate. Primary school teachers should first understand the students' families and second, implement adult education (not necessarily literacy). Third, according to Professor Buck's investigation of Chinese farmers, they have eight months of slack time each year, so the mission of rural primary school teachers should be to enable farmers to engage in handicrafts as a side business, encourage farmers to weave cloth and make hand-rolled cigarettes, etc., and order each county to restrict the sale of paper cigarettes (except for self-made ones). Other various cooperative methods can be used to induce them to do so. For example, teach weaving and then recognize the character "cloth," teach cigarette making and then recognize the character "cigarette," etc. In this way, we can start from the economic aspect and literacy, so that they know that education is life, not just literacy. If the above three methods are followed, how should we train normal school students to make them suitable? Only with this condition can we have universal education, not restricted education. However, this matter does not necessarily have to be done throughout the province, starting with one county or one school is also possible. Therefore, normal school students should be issued a temporary certificate in addition to the courses that can be examined. After they work, their work performance should be evaluated before they are given a graduation certificate. Therefore, we should decide how to train normal school students in order to decide how to examine them. I hope everyone will come up with a concrete plan.</p>
<p>▲Discussion by Principals After the speech, the principals expressed their opinions and discussed together in order to first formulate a concrete plan regarding the service, training, and examination of normal school students, and then discuss the examination issues. After a long discussion, because there were too many people and the speeches filled the hall, it was difficult to come up with a unified outline. Therefore, it was decided to switch to group discussions, and the chairman appointed five people to serve as group leaders, each leading a discussion. Those designated were Cai Fuyuan, principal of the First Normal School, Yang Shutian, principal of the Second Normal School, Qian Zhendong, principal of the First Rural Normal School, Zhao Derou, principal of the Fourth Rural Normal School, and Wang Xuxing, principal of Qihe County Normal School. Group discussions were conducted at 2:00 PM and ended at 5:00 PM. The results of each group's discussion varied. It was decided to continue the plenary meeting at 9:00 AM tomorrow (21st) for joint discussion and to make a final decision.</p>
<p>▲Chairman Han's Instructions on the Second Day At 9:00 AM on the 21st, the principals continued to meet in the Department of Education's library. Lai Zhizhong chaired the meeting and continued to discuss the five-day group proposals on service, training, and examination issues. Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han Fuju attached great importance to this meeting. At 10:00 AM, he and Director of Education He Liyuan arrived to give instructions, which ended at 11:00 AM. Another meeting was held in the afternoon. Because the discussion of the proposals was not finished, the meeting continued the next day. Han's instructions included the points that the constraints on students must be strict, the progress of the people depends entirely on education, and the education of talents should meet the needs.</p>

<p>▲ No Games from Tonight Until the 25th</p>
<p>The Xi Qing Basketball League will cease games to celebrate Christmas from tonight until the evening of the 25th. Yesterday evening's three games concluded as follows:</p>
<p>▲ Ming Qiang Defeats Mai Ling: Although Ming Qiang players are not as tall as those of Mai Ling, their skills are superior, but progress was still difficult. Ming Qiang won most points in the first half, 15 to 14. In the second half, Ming Qiang understood their opponents well and used their own strengths to exploit the weaknesses of others. As a result, the situation changed and they achieved a great victory, resulting in 47 to 22.</p>

<p>▲ Qing Guang defeats Ye Shi: Qing Guang's Lu Dazhen opened the scoring by raising his arms and throwing the ball into the basket. Ye Shi did not want to fall behind and launched a counterattack, but their repeated attempts were unsuccessful, leading to a disorganized line. Qing Guang's Chen Baoqiu and Tan Dahua continued to score, resulting in a large point difference. Qing Guang led 38 to 9 in the first half. In the second half, Ye Shi seemed to awaken from a slumber and were incredibly brave, scoring eight points in a row. Qing Guang was like Ye Shi in the first half, dominated by the opponent, losing ground rapidly. From a lead of 40 to 17, the score narrowed to 40 to 27. Fortunately, they turned things around in time and managed to hold on, creating a confrontational situation. At that time, Ye Shi had a good chance of recovering, but time was running out. The game ended, and Ye Shi lost by six points, resulting in a 57 to 51 victory for Qing Guang.</p>

<p>▲ Yue Zhong Defeats French Army: At the beginning of the game, Yue Zhong underestimated their opponents, resulting in a chaotic and disorganized battle. Yue Zhong took the lead in the first half, 18 to 16. In the second half, Yue Zhong revealed their true colors, with excellent attacks and defense. They scored forty-two points in one breath, while the French Army only managed to get one point. The difference in skill was obvious. As a result, Yue Zhong won a great victory, 78 to 23.</p>

Since its opening two months ago, there have been no fewer than hundreds of participants every day. The water temperature is suitable, the facilities are complete, the interest is high, and the benefits are significant. The association plans to increase the interest of the public in this sport and has decided to hold a performance on the 30th of this month. There are ten programs, all of which are very interesting. Registration is now open at the sports department of the association on Sichuan Road (registration fee: four dimes). Members and non-members are welcome. The two items are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) 20-yard freestyle (any style), (2) Floating competition (complete standstill), (3) Underwater needle search (three-minute limit), (4) Bound-foot swimming (20-yard race), (5) Treading water endurance (using both hands and feet), (6) Underwater diving (20-yard race), (7) Relay race (two people per team), (8) Fancy diving (free choice), (9) Lifesaving competition (two people per team), (10) 60-yard three-style competition (freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke)</p>
<h3 id="e238">Municipal Stadium Decided to be Built in the City Center <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>Occupying an Area of Approximately 300 Mu</p>
<p>Construction Cost: 1 Million Yuan</p>
<p>Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng previously convened prominent figures from Shanghai's elite circles and the business community to discuss the city's library, museum, and stadium. Preparatory meetings have been held repeatedly. According to city government sources, the locations of the museum and library have not yet been determined. However, the stadium has been decided to be built in the city center, utilizing existing parkland within the area, expanding and transforming it. It will occupy an area of approximately 300 mu, with a construction cost of 1 million yuan. The mayor has hired several experts to handle the planning. Once the city government has completely moved to the city center, construction will begin. It is hoped that the Second National Games of the Republic of China in 1935 and the next Far Eastern Games can be held in the new stadium, it is said.</p>

<p>The final of the 6th Xiangbin Cup table tennis tournament was held as scheduled at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association the night before. The strength of the Jian De and Ze Xin teams was considered to be equal. Unexpectedly, the result of the competition was that Ze Xin was miserably defeated by a score of 1 to 6. Looking back on the competition, Ze Xin's defeat was truly due to a lack of spirit and courage. The loss of the third group by a score of 1 to 3 was the most fatal blow. Afterwards, the team's morale was greatly disrupted, and they had no fighting spirit at all. Jian De, on the other hand, was filled with heroic spirit, and the soldiers gave their all. As a result, they won three more groups. Ze Xin was miserably defeated. In the final group, the Jian De team members forfeited. The audience suddenly began to criticize. For a moment, the order was slightly disrupted. Fortunately, the officials of the cup tournament invited Jian De's Lu Xiulu and Ze Xin's Deng Guofu to give a demonstration match to calm things down.</p>
<p>With the outcome decided, the association invited Ms. Li Hong to present the prizes. Finally, a celebratory banquet was held, and the event ended. Referees: Ming Binqi and Lu Tangjun. Recorders: Jia Qinchang. Linesmen: Liu Keren and Shen Dingyi.</p>

<h3 id="e241">The Great Wall <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>China’s Great Wall is, like the Egyptian pyramids, one of the world's famous, great, and ancient structures. Recently, the historian Hendrik Willem van Loon described the Great Wall of China in his works, saying: "... along the Yellow Sea coast, the fertile plains of China were always open to the strong invaders of Central Asia. To compensate for this shortcoming, the Chinese emperors of the third century BC built a huge city wall, 1,500 miles long, 20 feet wide, and more than 30 feet high, from Liaodong Bay all the way to the Jiayu Pass west of Yizhou City on the edge of the Gobi Desert. This granite barrier has served its purpose well. In the middle of the seventeenth century, the Manchus attacked fiercely, but it could not resist. However, a defense that has lasted for nearly two thousand years is, after all, no small matter. The walls we build today will be useless after ten years, and we will have to spend a great deal of money to rebuild them. ..." I can't tell if this is praise or mockery. However, the Great Wall did its duty in protecting the territory and ensuring the safety of the people from the Han Dynasty to before the Qing Dynasty. Who says that from the Han Dynasty to now, every scholar has scolded Qin Shihuang? But we should speak up for Qin Shihuang on this point. If it weren’t for this autocratic tyrant building this huge city wall to block the invasion of the Huns, perhaps the Huns would have already moved south to graze their horses, and we would not have been able to study the Four Books for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Since China’s territory expanded north to the Sayan Mountains, the Great Wall has become something only for sightseeing and appreciation. Although it seemed to have done a little duty for both sides in the Zhili-Fengtian War, this was a small matter for the Chinese themselves and not worth mentioning. In short, the Great Wall has indeed been dead for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>However, things in the world are unpredictable. The Great Wall, which had been dead for hundreds of years, has been resurrected after some ingenious changes one after another since the September 18th Incident in Shenyang. Not only is it serving us, but it is also serving our invaders. This kind of miracle of "turning decay into magic" is something that not even the autocratic tyrant Qin Shihuang, who lived twenty years ago, could have foreseen, nor could the modern geographer Hendrik Willem van Loon have foreseen. Van Loon praised it as a defense that has lasted for more than two thousand years, but we still don’t know how many more years it will last! Thinking of this, I really can't help but join Van Loon in praising it as "no small matter after all"!</p>
<h3 id="e242">In a Small Opium Shop <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>A friend led me into a small opium shop in "Manchukuo." Its name was "Drunken Immortals Abode."</p>
<p>The time was at night. As soon as I entered, I felt as if I had entered another world. In this world, there is no bright sun, no fresh air. What it has is a strong, stimulating fragrance, and some dim lights that appear and disappear in the hazy smoke. This is probably the blessed land where the immortals lie drunk. I congratulated myself for also becoming an immortal once.</p>
<p>A large room with plank beds built facing each other. The beds on both sides were full of people. Small opium lamps, fragrant smoke, and the "che la," "che la" sound of smoking drove all the people toward the land of immortals.</p>
<p>"Come on, old man."</p>
<p>Like a waiter in a restaurant, a waiter with a smoke tray in his hand greeted us and then pointed to one of the few remaining empty spaces on the big bed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he called me back to the human world, and all the phenomena in front of me escaped from the land of immortals.</p>
<p>My friend, a man who had been mixing in the world of Harbin for many years, had considerable experience in social matters. He stood motionless on the floor, only glancing sideways with his eyes. This had an effect. Sure enough, the waiter changed his tune:</p>
<p>"Ah, do you gentlemen want to go to a private room?"</p>
<p>After asking this question, before we could even nod our heads, he shouted:</p>
<p>"A private room for two!"</p>
<p>Stepping out of the big room, I followed my friend to the backyard, where the private rooms were located. Each one was a small, single room. At first glance, it was no different from the setup of a restaurant. I never thought that a small shop would have different seating arrangements and such a large scale.</p>
<p>However, I was startled by a strange laughter from a woman, and I quietly asked my friend:</p>
<p>"What? Are there women here?"</p>
<p>"No, you'll find out in a while."</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, I accompanied him to lie down on the plank bed in the private room. The small plank bed could only accommodate the two of us, with only room for the opium lamp in the middle. The waiter came over, took out two opium bubbles, and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Gentlemen, would you like to call one to play?"</p>
<p>My friend looked at me and smiled. I understood what his smile meant. He was answering the question I had just asked him. I realized that the women here were prostitutes.</p>
<p>"What do you think?"</p>
<p>He asked for my opinion, and I shook my head.</p>
<p>This made him laugh:</p>
<p>"Old friend, you've been traveling south and north for so many years, and you haven't learned any good tricks. You have to call one, you absolutely have to call one."</p>
<p>He sent the waiter away. I didn't say anything more. Anyway, I was here for sightseeing. Seeing more is naturally better than seeing nothing. However, to be honest, I am really incompetent in these kinds of situations, and I even blush at the mention of them.</p>
<p>I watched my friend smoke. Because I had agreed with him beforehand that I would absolutely not take a single puff, he lit the opium and smoked it himself, without offering it to me. I watched him smoke, the smoke puffing out one puff at a time. Suddenly, I felt that this matter was very poetic. From burning the opium, to inhaling it into the stomach, and then exhaling the remaining smoke, this requires considerable artistic cultivation. However, when I thought of how this one gun could ruin a person’s life, and how the current "Manchukuo," under the direction of Japanese imperialism, was using the public sale of opium to eliminate the Manchurian people's ambition and courage to resist, all the poetry I felt was dispelled, and the drifting smoke was like a layer of impenetrable clouds of sorrow for me.</p>
<p>When the woman revealed her sallow face at the door, I stood up and said goodbye to my friend. I said to him:</p>
<p>"Friend, I can't do it. I'm feeling a little unwell, I have a headache, let me go back first."</p>
<h3 id="e243">Nalan Chengde's Poetic Theory (Continued) <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Liang</p>

<p>In addition, Nalan Chengde also studied phonetics, the origins of poetry, and other topics, which cannot all be introduced here. However, from what has already been discussed, we can know that he was a scholar with broad knowledge and in-depth research. His success, as evidenced by "Lushui Ting Miscellaneous Records," comes more from diligent learning than from genius. This is something very worthy of our attention, something that we cannot think of simply by reading his poems. In this book, there is also a point that, although it discusses other matters, his view that one must first understand the spirit of others before criticizing them is extremely valuable. Many scholars today (?) often criticize people without first trying to understand their scholarship. I think Nalan Chengde's opinion is also very beneficial for them. In these two senses, I will quote this passage as the conclusion of this article:</p>
<p>If you do not read their books and do not know their ways, but only hold onto your own opinions and scold them recklessly, you will only reveal your own ignorance... Generally speaking, when people of the same school gather together, they can only talk about the things of their own school. They consider themselves outstanding, but they do not realize their own ignorance. In reading, it is important to be meticulous; in learning, it is important to be broad and practical. Speaking and writing, galloping a horse cannot catch up. It is not an easy task.</p>
<h3 id="e244">Small Notes from a Traveler's Window <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Shu</p>

<p>Lu You's "Lao Xue An Notes" records:</p>
<p>When Liu Shaomei was in the capital, he did not travel with his family for many years. He used his salary exclusively to copy books. He would copy each book three times, even if it was a work of hundreds of volumes. When he was not working, he would close his door and proofread the books, not receiving guests. After returning to Sichuan, he divided the books into three boats to guard against loss. Later, when traveling to Zigui Xintan, one boat was destroyed by the rocks of the rapids. The other two boats were unharmed, so he returned to Puci and built a pavilion to store them.</p>
<p>Liu Shaomei's love for books can be said to be extraordinarily thorough in its protection. However, this method, while good, is not something that a poor young man can do. It is like looking at the "Siku Quanshu" that is not for sale, with nothing to do but admire it. Speaking of the "Siku Quanshu," I think of the copy in Shenyang. In order to prevent loss, four copies were specifically written and placed in four different places, equivalent to Liu Shaomei's "three boats" plan. However, Liu Shaomei's books eventually went from three to two, and among the "Siku Quanshu," only the "Wenlan Pavilion" copy in Hangzhou is the most complete. If the "Wenlan Pavilion" copy were to... what would happen? I think there is no problem, because it is already being prepared again. The "Siku Quanshu" is being reprinted, and it is clearly stated in the origin of the printing that the number of copies will be increased from four to one thousand. What does it matter if one or two more copies are moved away? China has plenty of places and plenty of books. It has always been "happy to do good and not refuse anyone."</p>
<p>Seventeen</p>
<p>Wen Ting Shi’s “Wen Chen Ou Ji” contains many historical materials about the Taiwan campaign. Among them is a saying:</p>
<p>"After the peace talks were concluded, someone wrote a couplet on the city gate:</p>
<p>May the Emperor live ten thousand years without end, may all under heaven rejoice:</p>
<p>The three armies were defeated, the land was ceded to sue for peace.</p>
<p>Then another couplet was spread:</p>
<p>Taiwan Province has returned to Japan,</p>
<p>Yiheyuan is erecting stages once again."</p>
<p>The indignation of the people at that time and the imperial family's joy are evident here.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Two Brothers (6)(7) <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Written by Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>He spoke in a short, choppy, almost incoherent way, like someone suffering from hallucinations.</p>
<p>He seemed to have forgotten Jean and his mother in the next room. He spoke as if no one else was there, because he had to speak, because he was in so much pain, because he had pressed too hard on his wound. The wound swelled into a tumor, and the tumor burst, spewing pus that defiled everyone. He paced back and forth as usual, staring straight ahead, gesticulating, speaking in a kind of desperate madness; his throat was filled with sobs, a reaction of resentment towards himself; he confessed his suffering, that kind of family suffering, as if throwing his pain into the unheeding air filled with leaping words.</p>
<p>Jean was horrified, his eyes almost suddenly persuaded by his brother's blind force, he stood close to a door, guessing that their mother was listening behind that door.</p>
<p>She couldn't come out: she had to go through the living room to come out. But she hadn't returned to the living room; yet she didn't dare come in.</p>
<p>Pierre suddenly stamped his foot and shouted:</p>
<p>"Ah, I'm really a pig for saying these things!"</p>
<p>Then he ran downstairs without even putting on his hat.</p>
<p>The big door leading to the street slammed shut, the sound shocking Jean out of his deep stupor. Several seconds, which seemed longer than a few hours, passed, and his soul had not yet escaped from that state of blank foolishness. He felt that he had to consider things immediately, that he had to do something, but he waited, because of fear, weakness, and cowardice, he didn't even want to understand, to comprehend, to remember. He belonged to that kind of procrastinator who puts everything off until tomorrow, and even when he had to make a decision immediately, he still instinctively tried to delay for a while.</p>
<p>But after Pierre's shout, now the deep silence around him, the silence reflected from the walls and furniture, combined with the light of ten candles and two lamps, made him suddenly so terrified that he wanted to run away himself.</p>
<p>So he shook his thoughts, shook his heart, and tried to think.</p>
<p>He had never encountered any difficulties in his life. He was one of those people who drifted along, letting himself flow like water. He had studied diligently in elementary and secondary school to avoid being punished. He had completed his law studies at university in a regular and orderly manner, because his life was peaceful. Everything in the world seemed very natural to him, and did not attract his special attention. There was not a single secret place in his mind, because, due to his nature, he liked order and integrity. Therefore, he now faced this tragedy like someone who had never swam falling into the water.</p>
<p>He began to try to doubt. Had his brother lied because of resentment and jealousy?</p>
<p>But if he hadn't been desperate to the extreme, how could he have stooped to saying those insulting words about their mother? And in his ears, in his eyes, in their nerves, even in his flesh, there remained a part of Pierre's words, a part of the painful cries, some tones and gestures of pain that were as irresistible and undeniable as facts.</p>
<p>His spirit was completely shattered, he simply couldn't make a movement or have a will. He was in unbearable distress; and he felt that his mother was right behind the door, she had heard everything, she was waiting.</p>
<p>What was she doing? Not a single movement, a single tremor, a single breath, a single sigh, could make one think that there was a person behind the door panel. Had she run away? But where could she run away from? What if she had run away... what if she had jumped from the window to the street!</p>

<h3 id="e246">Finance: US President Approves London Silver Agreement, Margin Plummets 31.3 Yuan <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>Government Sets Silver Buying Price at 64.5 Cents, Mint to Begin Stamping Standard Silver Coins</p>
<p>US Silver Night Market Jumps 300 Points, Further Declines Expected with New Low of 671 Yuan</p>
<p>Winter Solstice Holiday on Monday and Tuesday, Long Positions Panic, One-Sided Situation</p>
<p>The gold market suffered a severe crash. Overseas telegrams frequently reported bad news. Moreover, with the Western winter solstice falling on Monday and Tuesday next week, most long positions suddenly panicked, resulting in a one-sided situation for the day. The market broke through three major levels: 700 yuan, 690 yuan, and 680 yuan. The market nearly broke through the 670 yuan level again (the lowest price reached 670 yuan), reaching a new low of 671 yuan. Initially, overseas silver markets slightly declined, exchange rates also fell, the US official gold buying price remained unchanged, US wheat decreased by one cent, US cotton experienced greater losses, and stocks also declined. The opening price of raw silk was relatively stable at around 0.08 yuan, and the situation was fairly calm. Subsequently, a Reuters dispatch from Washington reported that the US President had approved the London Silver Agreement and had ordered the government to purchase silver at 64.5 cents per ounce, causing a wave of declines that broke the 700 yuan level. Although the market stabilized due to bank support after the opening, it was difficult to exceed the 700 yuan level. Reuters also reported that the US Mint would mint standard silver coins and that the President had issued a thousand-word proclamation to purchase silver at 64.5 cents, issuing an order to the Mint to convert half of the 24 million ounces of silver produced annually by the US and its territories into silver coins as reserves. This caused the market to break the 690 yuan level. Senator Pittman stated that the President's move could increase US exports and stabilize silver prices and increase commodity prices. Furthermore, a private telegram from a Western merchant claimed that a message had been received that the US silver night market exchange had soared by 300 points, causing the market to break the 680 yuan level. At noon, the market rebounded due to bank support, but news spread that the US President, Morganthau, and Cummings had met and declared that India had also approved the London Silver Agreement and that other countries around the world would take similar actions, causing the market to struggle around 680 yuan. The afternoon market was relatively calm at the opening, but a Reuters dispatch claimed that the US would propose cooperation at the World Economic Conference, again pushing the market close to the 670 yuan level. Finally, exchange market buyers, Western merchants, speculators like Xiang Meng, and major players like Wu XX covered short positions and the market stabilized again. The premium price was 1075 yuan. The day's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 697.3 yuan, a decrease of 10 yuan compared to the previous close. Commodities: XX yuan and a half.

Subsequently, because there were very few sellers, and factories made slight purchases for the current month, sentiment turned for the better, rebounding by one or two fen compared to the opening. When the afternoon market opened, the current month continued to rise due to slight purchases from factories, and the market was firm. Trading volume was low for all distant months, and the market was hovering. However, the Hakka buyers were weak, and bullish positions in the current month were closed out, causing prices to soften again. It is heard that another shipment of foreign wheat has arrived for factories, but sales are not picking up, and inventories are increasing, making it difficult to be optimistic about future prospects. As a result, the current month improved slightly by 2.5 li, January improved by 7.5 li, February remained unchanged, March improved by 2.5 li, April improved by 5 li, and May improved by 2.5 li.</p>
<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, prices for all months continued to show a slight decline. Because the quoted price of foreign wheat from Chicago fell by a small two or three jiao, and from Canada by a small four fen, and the market had very few buyers, with no activity from outside customers, prices for January and February once entered customs at 4 yuan, January falling to 3 yuan 9 jiao 7 fen, and February falling to 3 yuan 9 jiao 9 fen. Subsequently, due to urgent short covering, prices rebounded slightly. When the afternoon market opened, prices were slightly better due to the steady trend in the flour market, but soon turned weak again. As a result, only March and April improved by 1 fen each, with no changes for the rest. In the current wheat market, due to the sharp drop in standards and the import of foreign wheat, it is difficult for merchants to reject the goods. Prices have fallen by five fen to one jiao. Yao Bay wheat is quoted at 4 yuan 5 fen, and Bengbu wheat at 3 yuan 9 jiao 7 fen, totaling 1,200 bags, handled by Huafeng Xinda.</p>
<h3 id="e260">He Xia Rice Rushed in, Prices Fell <a href="#e260" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c260" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">260</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from all regions surged, with over fifty varieties of thick japonica and various types (over 7,000 shi), and about twenty varieties of late rice (over 3,000 shi). After the late rice market showed signs of softening in the previous market, it remained sluggish at the opening yesterday. Although regions such as Tianjin and Yantai resumed buying, the demand was very harsh, and sellers were willing to loosen their grip due to continuous sales and the inevitable gradual increase in inventory in Pudong. As a result, prices fell by a small chi. At this point, Hakka merchants showed slightly more interest, buying over 2,000 bags. The inventories of thick japonica from various regions were still acceptable, but the surge in supply led to insufficient absorption, resulting in a weakening market. Market prices fell by about a jiao. Du Yang's sharp goods were generally lacking and flat, and the path for Yin Bian Yuan became slightly sluggish, leading to a stabilizing trend.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Sixty ships arrived from various regions. Sales of all goods in the market were slow. The market shape of white flour changed, the price of Yin Yuan Yang Du埠 sharp goods was weak by several fen. Early Bo rice from Hakka merchants in the north was similar to yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e261">Hakka Xian Rice Sales in Fujian Lagging <a href="#e261" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c261" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">261</a></h3>
<p>The market remains weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, after Hakka Xian rice's price reduction and strong sales the day before, sentiment stabilized slightly, and the market was also active. Some customers, due to the activity in the market, were unwilling to sell at low prices, and insisted on limited prices yesterday, refusing to sell at lower prices. However, sales in the local street were sluggish due to the sluggish sales of Hakka rice, and they also remained on the sidelines. Fujian merchants, due to the serious situation, the economy was not loose, and temporarily there were no ship berths available, so they stopped continuing purchases. The cessation of sales in Fujian caused both sentiment and the market to trend downward. Yesterday, the entire city only sold 163 bags of Wuhu Ji Yuan rice at 7 yuan 5 jiao 8 fen and 300 bags of Hunan Ji Bo rice at 7 yuan 2 jiao to 7 yuan 1 jiao 2 fen. The prices were similar to the previous market, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e262">Soybeans Fell Another Four or Five Fen <a href="#e262" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c262" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">262</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, although the outflow of soybeans was slightly more active, prices were declining. High-quality soybeans were flat due to scarcity, but medium-quality soybeans were subject to cheap sales. Factories adhered to the principle of only buying cheap goods. Seeing that merchants were willing to sell cheaply, they also took the opportunity to buy small quantities, leading to a continued decline of four or five fen in the market. Fortunately, the supply was not surging, so the decline was relatively moderate. Yesterday, the total market transaction volume for various soybeans was about eight or nine cartloads, it is said.</p>
<h3 id="e263">Sugar Market: Local Refined White Sugar Fell by One and a Half Jiao <a href="#e263" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c263" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">263</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a slight rebound in customs gold and the gold standard, and the trend weakened again. The association's price for 24 raw sugar white common grade was 19 yuan 7 jiao, down 7 fen from the previous day. Transshipment goods were down 5 fen, priced at 6 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen. The transshipment price for 20 medium sand white sugar P mark was 6 yuan 7 jiao. The transshipment price for 89 Dutch red sugar was 7 yuan 5 fen to 7 fen. The market trend was quite firm. Taikoo Sugar B mark was priced at 20 yuan 2 jiao, down 5 fen from the previous day. Zhenji refined white sugar, which had been stable for many days, fell by one and a half jiao due to the decline in raw sugar white. Grade 1 was 18 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen, Grade 2 was 5 jiao 5 fen, Grade 3 was 3 jiao 5 fen, and Grade 4 was 1 jiao 5 fen. The new tide green sugar opened at over 200 bags yesterday, all of which were common goods, priced at 13 yuan 8 jiao to 34 jiao, with no change from before.</p>

<p>Sichuan pickled mustard tuber, since the price increase, had slightly softened due to sluggish sales, but the remaining inventory was still not large, and no further supply arrived. Therefore, the recent market has become firmer again. Hakka goods opened at 31 yuan, and the top grade was sold at 32 yuan by the merchants. Common grades were 28-29 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Piece Goods: Plain Serge Sales Decline <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Plain serge always has business at the end of the year, and it is known as a popular item in the industry. Regular colors are even more popular, and there has been no decline in recent years. Currently, the trend of serge in the original color, regular blue, gray, and gray is seen to be downstream, especially the 3 yuan grade, which is even more in decline. Although both overt and covert prices have fallen, sales are still extremely sluggish. The reason is mostly due to the influence of the strong arrival of Japanese goods, coupled with the cold weather, the thin quality of serge, and buyers choosing other types of wool fabrics instead. Yesterday, only thirty to forty pieces were opened in the city at the association, and the price was cheaper than last week. Because it is not far from the end of the year, each store wants to sell goods and exchange them for cash.</p>

<h3 id="e284">On Foot Binding <a href="#e284" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c284" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">284</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>As the Republic of China is about to enter its 23rd year, discussing foot binding seems somewhat outdated; however, it is not. In recent days, orders concerning "small feet" have been repeatedly issued in the newspapers. First, Liu Jianqun, Director of the Political Training Department of the Peiping Military Branch, stated that foreigners were taking pictures of foot-bound women in villages near Zhangjiakou without the permission of the local government, creating malicious propaganda that "concerns the national image." This was submitted to the National Government and has been communicated to the主管 governments of all provinces by the Civil Service Department, instructing military and police agencies in all localities to strictly investigate and prohibit this practice. (See a Shanghai newspaper from the 11th of this month.) Furthermore, Li Shuchun and He Siyuan, inspectors from the Shandong Provincial Government, inspected Xiajin, Wucheng, Gaotang, Boping, and surrounding areas. They observed that the practice of foot binding among women was still prevalent in the counties they passed through. They sent a telegram to the provincial government requesting that all counties be notified to instruct officials of all agencies to actively promote foot release and to order students to wear armbands stating "Do not marry women with bound feet." (See a Tianjin newspaper from the 12th of this month.) "Based on this," the writing of "On Foot Binding" still seems quite novel.</p>
<p>Originally, binding a perfectly good pair of feet into "three-inch golden lotuses," causing women to sway and stagger while walking as if about to fall in the wind, was a unique indulgence of a particular ethnic group and not worthy of emulation. However, seeing these women ruin their bodies and injure themselves in the bitter effort to "please their admirers" paints a perfect picture of inequality between the sexes. The reason for this inequality lies in the economic background. Women in the past! Even now! Clearly, they have no economic standing. Since they have no control over the economy, they are naturally controlled by men who have economic power—this is an inevitable logic. Therefore, their only task is to please their admirers. They search through the collections of erotic poets for inspiration, destroying their "lotus boats" and creating "golden lotuses" and "crescent moons" for the ruling-class men to enjoy and praise as toys. The situation is truly pathetic. This concept seems to have become deeply ingrained in the minds of some.</p>
<p>Since the introduction of Western culture, enlightened women have risen to demand gender equality, and the "natural foot movement" was once all the rage. However, the result has been that, except for a few emancipated women in the cities, women in poor and remote areas—especially those north of the Yangtze River!—are, as the Shandong provincial inspectors reported, still widely practicing "foot binding." But what about the so-called emancipated women in the cities? They have merely changed from "three-inch golden lotuses" to "three-inch high heels," still "swaying and staggering" as they walk, "as if about to fall in the wind." This situation is somewhat similar to the political reforms of the past twenty years! Thus, although it appears on the surface that they have been liberated, they have merely replaced the old chains with new shackles. In reality, they are still living under the belief of "pleasing their admirers." Using beauty to flaunt oneself is the pitiable state of most women, displaying their weaknesses to others. Therefore, fashionable women who wear high heels should not mock their foot-bound peers, as they are essentially in the same situation, living a life of begging for mercy in a male-dominated society. In this regard, the Shandong provincial inspectors' observation is correct: ordering students to wear armbands stating "Do not marry women with bound feet" will, I believe, be effective. Similarly, if an order were issued stating "Do not marry women who wear high heels," I believe it could also make high heels disappear—or at least reduce their prevalence. Women's fear lies not in the criminal code, but in disagreements with men—or rather, with economic power. But that is where the tragedy lies. Banning foot binding leads to wearing high heels; if high heels are banned, new tricks to please men will arise to replace them. Until the economic status of women is effectively improved, this cannot be stopped, and there is no way to talk about "gender equality."</p>
<p>This is again a question of "human nature."</p>
<p>As for prohibiting foreigners from taking "small feet" pictures, this is originally intended to prevent washing dirty linen in public. However, it is impossible to prohibit outsiders before prohibiting insiders. A body full of sores will always have one or two exposed for others to see. What "concerns the national image" is surely not just "small feet"!</p>

<h3 id="e285">French Novelist "De Gopailla" Enamored with Chinese Women <a href="#e285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>French luxury and prosperity are world-renowned; hence, its capital, Paris, is also called the "City of Flowers." The extravagance and flirtatiousness of French women are also world-renowned; therefore, most of the sensual, debauched, and erotic films depict French women. Students from our country often like to marry French women because they are intoxicated by their coquettishness and infatuated with their beauty. Who would want a "yellow-faced woman" who is made in China?</p>
<p>Little did we know that things would be different. A few days ago, the French novelist Mr. De Gopailla came to Peiping. He made a statement expressing great admiration for Chinese women, which was truly laughable. Ms. Pan Junying, a writer of the New Romantic School, expressed her opposition and refuted him point by point. Here is a record of what they said:</p>
<p>De Gopailla said: "My special impression of China is that the modern Chinese women are indescribably beautiful. The clothes they wear seem to be wrapped around their bodies, and their faces are flat."</p>
<p>Ms. Pan retorted: "In fact, French women wear clothes that are wrapped around their bodies. Chinese women are known for their propriety and cannot be subjected to the irresponsible slander of those who do not understand propriety!"</p>
<p>De Gopailla said: "My ideal person to marry is a humorous Chinese woman with 'Oriental beauty,' which would be a comfort for life."</p>
<p>Ms. Pan retorted: "This statement is even more outrageous: French youths fall in love, and Chinese youths also fall in love. How can one talk about marriage without falling in love?"</p>
<p>De Gopailla said: "The most beautiful Chinese women are in Suzhou. When I listened to Chinese songs at the Confucius Temple in Nanjing, there was a Suzhou singer named Xue Yanqin. Her graceful posture on stage captivated my soul for days."</p>
<p>Ms. Pan retorted: "Mr. De has not traveled in China for long, but he is already so absurd as to regard the singer Xue Yanqin as the representative of Suzhou women. May I ask how many Suzhou women Mr. De has seen and whether he has had long conversations with noble Suzhou women? Educated women in China deeply know that women are independent individuals; they are not exclusively engaged in social interactions and neglect their proper occupations. Why does Mr. De not observe this and instead slander and ridicule Chinese women? Chinese women consider Mr. De a 'literary rogue'!"</p>
<p>Haha! Hearing the words of this French novelist, Mr. De Gopailla, I couldn't help but laugh so hard that my teeth fell out. Ms. Pan Junying's rebuttal can be described as incisive and enlightening. After hearing it, Mr. De Gopailla can also understand the "dignity" of Chinese women. Mr. De said, "The clothes worn by modern Chinese women seem to be wrapped around their bodies." In fact, women in your country expose their breasts and show off their legs, and the beauty of their curves is indescribable. The art of the buttocks, in particular, is something that our country's women cannot learn even a fraction of. Women in your country are truly indescribably beautiful啊. Indeed, your French women have high noses, yellow hair, and yellow eyes: doesn't your old sir think that these are "beautiful elements"? However, weight can be measured, length can be determined, and quantity can be counted—all with specific tools and standards. Only "beauty" and "ugliness" lack measuring tools. A male dog finds a female dog more and more adorable the more he looks at her; a yellow bull finds another yellow bull more and more beautiful the more he looks at him. Birds of a feather flock together, so why should you look at the flat faces of our country's women and become a "lecher"?</p>
<p>It is said that "the standard beauty in the West is Caucasian; the standard beauty in the East is Suzhou." Beautiful mountains and rivers, the concentration of spiritual energy—is this the reason for the birth of beauties? In fact, it is not entirely so. Chinese prostitutes are divided into two gangs, "Suzhou" and "Yangzhou," with Suzhou being superior and Yangzhou being inferior. In fact, Suzhou is not a place that produces prostitutes. The area at the junction of Suzhou and Wuxi, called "Dangkou," is the special origin of prostitutes: people of the world should not wrong the people of Suzhou ah. Yangzhou prostitutes are ranked lower because their accent is not as fluent and gentle as that of Suzhou people. In fact, was not Xi Shi, whose beauty has been famous for thousands of years, from Shaoxing? She probably couldn't speak "Wu soft words." Mr. De Gopailla, seeing the Suzhou singer Xue Yanqin, was captivated for days. I wonder what his soul would be like if he met a Suzhou woman plowing the fields barefoot?</p>

<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>In China, when a person dies, his or her relatives, acquaintances, or friends, regardless of whether they had any feelings for the deceased during his or her lifetime or even interacted much with him or her, always send some wreaths, tin foil, or incense candles...etc., because they feel that this is an unavoidable "etiquette." Whether it is beneficial to the deceased is another question.</p>
<p>Generally, people feel that these "gifts" are too meaningless, so some have advocated replacing these pointless "gifts" with tangible money to be used as a scholarship fund for the deceased. And in fact, this method has been implemented to a considerable extent. This, although it can make the deceased "leave a name for posterity," is still questionable whether it is beneficial to the deceased himself. The only ones who benefit are those poor students.</p>
<p>So how can the deceased actually benefit? This is a question that has long wanted to be solved but cannot be solved (?)</p>
<p>But we great Chinese, after all, are not as good as the "blue-eyed, blond-haired" foreigners, who solved this serious question (?) without much effort! If you don't believe it, look at the London correspondence of the World Society published in this newspaper on the 16th:</p>
<p>"The Daily Express published a strange advertisement, signed by Mr. Fairtham, which reads; 'To all my friends and enemies, the advertiser wishes that those who would give me gifts of fresh flowers and wreaths after my death would convert them into cash now, because this is much more beneficial than offering me withered flowers after death. Whether the donation is large or small, I will gratefully accept it. Fairtham, at the Storent Hotel.'"</p>
<p>Whether this foreign man is humorous or sad, we will not go into it, but we cannot help but wonder whether this plan (?) has any possibility of being implemented. Most people send those pointless "gifts" to the deceased merely driven by false etiquette, while that foreign man wants to obtain cash before his death, which inevitably makes one doubt its feasibility.</p>
<p>So, will this serious question (?) forever have no hope of being solved?</p>

<p>— Ze Qing</p>
<p>Generally, people are reluctant to consider themselves "old." Sometimes, when asked about their age, they always conceal at least three to five years or one to two years. Especially women, simply refuse to tell others their true age. As the saying goes, "Eighteen years old every year." This captures the psychology of many women, and the older people get, the more flirtatious they become. Look at Lao Lai Zi in the Spring and Autumn period, who still wore colorful clothes and played children's games even at the age of seventy. Although this was for entertainment purposes, later generations praised him as a model of filial piety. It is also an example of "old people not having old hearts." And look at the general women in society, pretending to be delicate and artificial, so-called "Xu Niang half-old, charm still remains." Isn't this evidence that old people have flirtatious hearts?</p>
<p>There are also several epithets that people absolutely refuse to accept. For example, calling a gluttonous person "old glutton" or "old greedy." Calling a useless person "old朽." Calling a confused person "old悖." Calling a stingy person "old慳." Calling an old and weak person "old邁," "old物!" or "old槍." Calling a pedantic person "old顽固." Calling a person who has lost virtue "old but not dead." If they receive such epithets, they not only refuse to accept them, but also desperately negotiate with the person who said them.</p>
<p>However, there are several epithets that both old and young people are happy to receive. For example, calling a teacher "old scholar" or "teacher." Calling a person with some reputation in the local area "old gentleman" or "old丈." If he himself or his children and grandchildren become officials, calling him "old爺," "old大人," "old太爺," or "old封翁," and calling his "wife" "old夫人" or "old太太." If he has a child at an old age, calling him "old蚌珠." Calling a person with ambitions at an old age "old骥伏枥." Calling a person with accomplishments at an old age "old少年." Calling a person with deep experience "old成练达," "old马识途." Calling a person who is familiar with handling affairs "old手." Calling a person with extraordinary air "old气横秋." Calling a person who is thoughtful "old谋深算." Calling a person who is sincere "old实君子." Sometimes he himself is happy and actually calls himself "old夫," "old汉," or "old手." If he is humble, he calls himself "old拙" or "old朽." Women mostly call themselves "old身." But there are also those who frankly call themselves "old娘." Monks call themselves "old衲." As for nuns... I don't know what they call themselves "old"!</p>
<p>When celebrating a birthday, whether it is thirty, forty, fifty, sixty... his own hopes and the praises of others are always the "older" the better. For example: wishing a man a long life "南極" "old"人." Wishing a couple a long life "齊眉偕老" "白頭偕老." In general, the hearts of adults and gentlemen not only want to be "older" but also hope to welcome old age as soon as possible. Therefore, they celebrate their birthdays every year. Some even celebrate their birthdays several times a year. It can be seen that the word "old" also gives people extremely joyful moments!</p>
<p>In addition, meritorious veterans are called "founding elders," and virtuous elders are called "耆老." Old servants are called "old家人." Old women are called "old太婆." Long-aged wine is called "old酒." Calling male cousins "old表." Calling close friends "old友." Calling elders "old伯." Calling paternal grand-uncles or elders "old公公." Calling shopkeepers "old闆." Calling fellow villagers "old乡." Calling prostitutes "old鸨." In Shanghai dialect, there are "old举," "old蟹," "old牌," "old前辈," "old资格," "大好old," "大老官"... There is also "出old" for scolding people, and "old土" for addiction.</p>
<p>The above is just what I can think of at the moment. As for the rest, I am too "old" to think of it all at once. When we use the word "old" for people, we need to consider it carefully. Never "rely on the old to sell the old" or "old三old四." Otherwise, it is easy to make people "old羞成怒" and give you a "old拳" while asking you, "Are you old or not"!</p>

<p>— Chuan Shaoyan, courtesy name Meigen, pseudonym Dongchi Jushi from Hunan</p>
<p>In the Yu Gong, Qingzhou is said to have strange rocks that resemble aluminum. One calls them "strange stones," and those that resemble jade are now often found on the Qi'an River. These beautiful stones are indistinguishable from jade, and are mostly red, yellow, and white in color. Their patterns resemble the whorls on human fingers, being exquisitely clear and lovable. Even the most skilled artists cannot match them in their deliberate paintings. Could this be what the ancients referred to as "strange stones?" The beauty and ugliness of all things arise from comparison. I do not know where the truth lies. Written before the winter solstice of Guiyou year. Dongchi Yan</p>

<h3 id="e289">Big Sale <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Zu</p>
<p>All the major companies, as well as the small shops, have "Spring Big Sales" in spring, "Summer Big Sales" in summer, autumn similarly has autumn big sales, and inevitably "Winter Big Sales" in winter. Besides these seasonal big sales, there are also so-called "Christmas Big Sales," "Special Big Sales," and "Closing Down Big Sales," etc. It seems that they cannot increase customers to buy their goods without "sales." Because of this, the "big sales" of these companies and small shops cannot help but arouse my great suspicion. I think: if their "sales" throughout the year really reduced prices, then these stores would close down at most after a year! Otherwise, this proves that their so-called "sales" are just a deceptive smokescreen.</p>
<p>My mother is most fond of chanting scriptures. She often says: "If I could have three copies of the Amitabha Sutra, two copies of the Lotus Sutra, and two copies of the Diamond Sutra, then I would die content. But to buy these sutras would cost several hundred yuan! "One day, a monk came to my house and said that when he was "in seclusion," he had chanted four copies of the Amitabha Sutra, three copies of the Lotus Sutra, and three copies of the Diamond Sutra. Now, because he wants to build a new temple, he is willing to bear the pain of "selling at a reduced price." Originally, the Diamond Sutra cost sixty yuan per copy, the Lotus Sutra forty yuan, and the Amitabha Sutra twenty-five yuan. Now they are all "discounted" by ten yuan. My mother was very happy to hear this and bought several copies of each from him. Ah! Even those who cultivate themselves with pure hearts have "big sale" days, so no wonder big sales are so common.</p>
<p>One day, I went to a school to play and saw a notice that said something like this: "From next week to Saturday will be the registration date for this school. If you register within the specified date, you can get a reduction of one-fifth of the tuition fee for the next semester. If you register after this period, you must pay all fees according to the regulations. If there are sisters registering together, the tuition fee can be discounted by 5%," and so on. This so-called "school" is also having a "big sale"!</p>
<p>In our hometown, some families treat their daughters like commodities. If the daughter is even slightly beautiful, they really treat her as a piece of property. Therefore, in terms of jewelry and betrothal gifts, they will use exploitative means to make demands on the "groom's family." But when the war broke out in Shanghai last year, and it was said that the countryside would also be affected, they couldn't afford the heavy burden of carrying young women, so when they met a suitable family, they sold their "property" at a discount丨betrothed丨them. "Big sales" have even come to marriage.</p>
<p>In this day and age, in this society, the "big sales" are probably not just the one or two things recorded here. Everything is subject to the fate of "big sales": things are like this, lives are like this, maps and territories are also like this! It's really not surprising.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Controversy Regarding the Term "My ××" <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Jingxin</p>
<p>Recently, I often see that anything used or eaten by children is prefixed with the word "my" as a name. For example, "My Pictorial" in a spring store, "My Pills" in a pharmacy, and so on. When I see these special and fashionable terms, I always have a big doubt: "What is this based on? Is it beneficial or harmful to children?" One day I questioned a friend about my doubts. He thought that "It only arouses children's interest or attention, and there is no question of benefit or harm." This answer cannot dispel my doubts. I feel that this question is small, but it has a great relationship with children.</p>
<p>According to Morgan's research on "Ancient Society," in the languages of primitive people and the barbarians still remaining on earth, there is no existence of "you" and "I," only "we," "you," and "them." The concept of "mine" came about after the emergence of the private property system. But when it comes to the future society, the relationship between people will inevitably become more complex and closer, groups will increase and occupy importance, and human life will gradually break away from the category of individualistic life and expand into collective life and social life. The concepts of "mine" and "individual" in the Middle Ages, when human beings were intoxicated and dominated by religion, feudal lords, and monarchs, did promote new social concepts. The prosperity of the early capitalist world was indeed the sole masterpiece of individualism. However, now that capitalism has developed to its final form, exposing unavoidable contradictions, society is suffering from panic, crisis, recession, overpopulation, overproduction, and other diseases. Individualism, which rose and fell with capitalism, will naturally end its mission like the setting sun near the Western Hills. If at this time someone still promotes individualism (just like advocating feudal warlords), everyone will boo it as an act of turning back the clock. In other words, desperately engraving the selfish concepts of "mine" and "own" on the pure and tender minds of children, and cultivating a person who only knows about himself and does not know about others, let alone the country or society, is this what society needs now or in the future? On the contrary, we should instill in children the concepts of society, country, and labor, and create producers who will be beneficial to society and useful to the country.</p>
<p>As for the word "mine," if it can arouse children's interest and attention, it is not the ultimate truth. Based on our usual observations, we know that children's psychology is similar to that of primitive people. They are thorough socialists who do not distinguish between you and me. Children often give their own things to their little friends without hesitation, and often take things from other people's homes that they think are useful without thinking it is stealing. We should make good use of this respectable foundation of children and make appropriate corrections. If we see a child grabbing other people's things without permission, instead of scaring him with the word "stealing," it would be better to persuade him with "Don't take things that others have worked hard to obtain, but create or exchange for things with your own hard work." This would be more effective and easier to understand.</p>
<p>In short, the current or future society definitely does not need people like warlords and treacherous merchants to dominate. I hope that the masters of the future - children - will be less infected with the germs of individualism left over from the old era.</p>

<p>▲ Invention of Skin-Moisturizing "Smooth" Water Dr. Xi Shitai has recently invented a skin-moisturizing water called "Smooth." It is a liquid, does not contain powder, and is non-sticky. It dries immediately upon application and has no pungent fragrance. When applied to the face, hands, and feet, it can make dry, rough, and chapped skin smooth and glossy. It can also eliminate frostbite before it ulcerates and reduce redness and itching. Men can apply it before and after shaving to prevent the occurrence of small rashes and eliminate the unpleasantness of the blade. Women can apply it before applying powder to make the powder extra smooth and delicate. Therefore, it can be used by men, women, and children of all ages, and is better than cold cream and honey. It is currently entrusted to the French Pharmacy as the general agent, with large bottles selling for five jiao and small bottles for three jiao.</p>

<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>(III) (8) Gloomy Dusk</p>
<p>To capture a woman's heart is not an easy task, but to win back a woman's heart is even more difficult. Sister Min is determined to leave, and I no longer have the ability to keep her. In a gloomy dusk, gloomy emotions climbed onto everyone's gloomy hearts. The entire Zhengyi Society's atmosphere was even more serious than when it was first sealed. Sister Min buried her head and took care of packing her belongings, not answering everyone's advice. Countless pairs of eyes moved up and down, left and right, following her hands, as if everyone's fate was controlled by those hands.</p>
<p>The wind blew across the roof, and everyone's breathing could be heard in the room.</p>
<p>"Miss Sun," a rough voice suddenly broke the gloomy atmosphere. Xiao Huang did not know when he was holding a package and standing at the door, saying: "From my own position, if I can't keep Miss Sun, I will leave here first." When he spoke, he no longer resembled the smiling fat man on the screen.</p>
<p>Sister Min looked back, and everyone looked back to watch the tragedy of the actor who was good at playing comedy leads.</p>
<p>Sister Min's eyes moved across everyone's faces. She understood everyone's urgent feelings. Like an oppressed person surrendering, she kicked the boxes and other things at her feet and sat heavily on the bed, saying helplessly, "I'm not leaving, I'm not leaving."</p>
<p>"Min, really?" Gao Fei said.</p>
<p>"You still don't trust me? I'm not that kind of person. I won't stab you in the back. I won't plot against anyone!"</p>
<p>I knew she was angry. I winked at Gao Fei.</p>
<p>"Min, I trust you. You are the soul of our society!"</p>
<p>"Miss Sun, I also trust you!" Xiao Huang threw the package in his hand on the floor at the door and raised his hand to give a military salute.</p>
<p>"Pfft:" Sister Min laughed.</p>
<p>A weight of a thousand catties was pushed away from everyone's gloomy hearts in this gloomy dusk.</p>
<p>"Go down, I'm not leaving. Let me rest for a while." Sister Min fell onto the bed, looking very tired.</p>
<p>No one said a word, and they quietly went down the three floors. A'Fu was poking his head at the stairs, and when he saw us coming downstairs, he asked stammeringly, "Mr. Gao, is it time for dinner?" His attitude was as if he was also carrying a bellyful of worries.</p>
<p>"Let's start. I'm really hungry." Gao Fei patted his belly through his clothes and sighed a long breath.</p>
<p>Xiao Huang sat on the sofa, still expressionless. I went over and patted him on the shoulder and said, "Xiao Huang, you saved me."</p>
<p>"I saved you?" He opened his eyes wide. "Or did I cause the disaster? If Miss Sun leaves today, I don't know how I would be able to face you and the Zhengyi Society."</p>
<p>I sighed and looked at the clock on the wall. It was five quarters of an hour later than the usual dinner time.</p>
