<p>時評</p>
<h3>軍備競爭之再度緊張（愼）</h3>
<p>瑞士爲歐洲和平之聖地。亦世界民主國家之所宗仰者也。近以世界經濟恐慌深化之故。彼著名世界公園之瑞士。已無昔日之繁榮。向來羣鼓游興以從事於山明水秀之流連者。亦隨經濟之衰落而減少其興趣。不謂至於今日。此世人公認之樂土。且以擴張軍備聞。蓋自軍備縮小會議發生裂痕。德國退出國聯。意大利發生異議以後。歐洲諸國。愈感不安若德若法以至中國諸小國身當其衝者。固皆已盡力擴張軍備。並積極提倡軍需工業。以剌激一般經濟市圍。圖有以超越當前之難關。即如瑞士者。地域不過四萬一千方公里。人口不過四百十萬。常備兵力亦僅兩萬五千。目今鑒於歐洲形勢之緊張。又畏德法再度激戰。恐有殃及之虞。乃亦不惜以八千萬瑞士法郎之巨資。從事於充實軍備。其軍用之坦克車步兵砲。輕重機關槍。均分别增加對曾經服兵役已受訓練之人民。亦重新加以高深之訓練。吾人以瑞士例歐洲其餘諸國。即可以測知今日歐洲形勢。其緊急之程度爲何如矣。</p>
<p>夫人類社會。自初民時代以迄於近今。競爭之痕跡。固多過於其他和平之運動。且自國家組織形成之後。個人與個人間之競爭。乃轉化而爲國與國間或民族與民族間之對立。而人類社會之經濟、政治、文化、之推進。尤多賴此競爭對立之矛盾中繼續發展。迨一九一八年世界大戰終了。各國皆以損傷過重羣思休息。是以和平呼聲。始爲世界一般所接受。然而現在先進各國製造力極度發展。國内消費市塲。不能容納過剩之商品。海外殖民地及後進國家之市場。因競爭傾消而愈見縮小。市場愈小。則競爭愈烈。各强國爲保持其舊市場。開拓新市塲。及分割未確定範圍之市場起見。羣相以武力爲後盾。就全體觀察。其情勢固與一九一四年以前所謂武裝和平頗相類也。</p>
<p>武力競爭起。於是乎陸軍軍備縮小會議。遂不得不陷於停頓。即謂爲失敗。亦無不可。蓋列强經濟利害終不可調和。法國之安全保障。德國之軍備平等。意大利之改造國聯。英吉利之傳統外交。在在有互相衝突之勢。是陸軍軍縮。無法以謀適當解决。已甚顯然。而海軍則又何如。現在有財力擴大海軍。并有海軍力基礎者。僅英美日法意等五國。而此五國中海軍勢力較强者。又祇英美日三國。則海軍恊約。似較易成立。然海上爭覇運動。其中心在太平洋海上。此正屬於英美日三國競賽之範圍。各欲維持其軍事上之絶對優勢。華盛頓條約二年之後。即届滿期。一九三五年之海軍會議。又將何如。海軍軍艦比率。將因不平而至增加軍備乎。抑竟觸機即發而至於比武乎。此種極悲觀之觀察。吾人姑置不論。試祇就現狀分析。假定第二次華盛頓會議可召集。英美日諸國。即能略顧和平之需要。表示一切問題。可有討議餘地。則至少有以下之難題。第一、爲領導權問題。英美在以往華盛頓會議。曾支配一時。今後日本必將奮其全力以爭奪遠東之霸者地位。第二、艦型問題。在英國各殖民海軍要港遍世界。隨處可以上油加煤。故主張小型艦艇。日本壞地相接。攻守目標。均不在遠。亦可贊同小型。美國則不然。大西洋與太平洋相距太遠。菲列濱尤遠在六千浬外。即令採取極端守勢。亦須艦型較大。乃敷應用。此種主張。勢難相讓。第三、潛水艇之噸數。飛行母艦之制限。亦各執所見絶無合作之可能。陸海兩軍競賽之情形如此。則世界和平前途能有希望乎。</p>

<p>刦後六安施政概况</p>
<p>昔年赤化滿目瘡痍</p>
<p>六安通信、皖西素稱富饒、毘連豫鄂、山多竹木、尤富茶麻、祇以交通梗塞、輸出維艱、巨量貨藏、旣未得盡其材用、而政治文化之輸入、亦感困難、民性不失於浮誇、即失於偷惰、過去官紳、復施高壓手段、恣意剥削、桀傲詭譎之徒、又徒而播弄鼓惑之、民怨鑫深、遂爲赤匪所乘、演成皖西之浩刧、年來國軍圍勦、大獲勝利、裨河流域、城市村鎭、均已克復、史河西岸赤匪僞二十五·二十八兩軍、亦經各個擊破、多數消滅、少數三百五百之殘匪、則逃入深山大谷、以留苟延殘喘、但經加緊封鎖、致彼油鹽糧食、日感缺乏、倘不投誠自新、亦將自行消滅也、</p>
<p>第三區行政督察專員兼六安縣長秦振夫、自到任以來、對於安撫流亡、保衛地方、修築道路、增加生產、實施强迫敎育、檢舉土豪劣紳諸端、均極努力推行、據當地人士所述、區内被赤匪蹂躪各縣、國軍次第克復、爲時雖已年餘、然對於散匪之肅清、邪說之闢除、善後之舉辦、農村之興復、以及自治·自衛·建設·等新頒要政、尙未根本收效、推其原因、實由於民衆不明政府施政方法、未能恊助進行、有以致之、現公署特成立宣傳股、制定宣傳大綱及各項宣傳品、分組出發各縣、深入鄉村、講解新政舉辦方法、曉諭恊助勦匪事宜、并藉考察各縣施政情形、民衆痛苦、地方需要、亟待應興應革者、無不分令各縣、迅速遵辦、</p>
<p>去年專員秦振夫初到六安、乍見城内外市民、黃昏納凉、多用凉床隴設烟具、當街吸食鴉片、嗣經嚴厲禁止、始漸消聲歛跡、烟館烟捐、向充公安局及偵探隊之經費、今年七月、亦改由商號負担、而查封烟館、焚燬烟具、警察法警、舊有百餘名、多爲無薪職、全賴出票、酌收外水、每票至少十餘元、若遇刑事、勒索尤甚、今已澈底整頓、裁減人數大半、每月經費、除收娱樂捐及商號捐外、聞尙不敷三百元、官塲中尙時有「大人」「老爺」「師爺」種種舊稱、殊帶封建社會專制政體之臭味、亦經該專員下令廢除、</p>

<p>過去赤匪佔領時代之情形、據縣府及當地人士目擊者談、農田管業契據、大都燬滅無餘、阡陌則以六安係靠山縣份、田土高低不一、無法歸併、仍如舊觀、農場耕作、全未荒蕪、惟西南茶山竹木、多被砍伐、蔴樹產區、因受封鎖影響、無銷售市場、出產大减、住宅在戰爭交通地帶者、燒燬不少、而公所豪紳之屋宇、多收作縣區鄉蘇府之用、農民夷亡成分、以態度灰色、雙方受敵、及被逼充當匪軍戰亡者爲最多、分田以村爲單位、人以三斗田爲標凖、每斗田約可收穀二石餘、但以中小工農爲限、至富農被没收財產後、僅能分得瘠田壞地、分田以後、工作亦相隨而來、如任偵探·守衛·挖壕·洗衣·縫紉·摸瓜（殺人）·等是、并有擁護經濟義務、照納各項累進稅、入出兩抵、縱有餘、亦不多、并不得買賣或佃人耕作、若當赤匪或從事僞府工作者、則另組代耕隊、代其耕種、分後若有多餘者、劃爲公有、亦由代耕隊經營之、吸收現金與婦女首飾等、改鑄銀幣、强民使用、且有僞豫鄂皖邊省蘇維埃農民銀行、濫發紙票、所產竹木茶蔴等物、雖經僞合作社、力想偷銷匪區以外、究以封鎖嚴密、無法辦到、物價逐漸低落、金融日見枯竭、可想而知、各鄉村普設列寗小學、宣傳赤化、且由僞蘇府派員任敎、無須物殊經費、推廣甚易、如有互相攻詰、或被秘密告發者、則召全鄉大會公决、除普通罪過着罰役與禁閉外、倘被判爲反動、立即殘殺、雖骨肉至親、亦不得稍存袒卹之念、總計農民從匪之數、約有一萬五千、中多貧農雇農及工匠、工匠中又以剃頭匠爲最、收復後自首新自者、約一萬二千餘人、老弱幼稚、占大多數、蓋壯丁多被迫當匪軍、或從事僞蘇府工作、不死於迭次之園剿戰爭、即死於匪之自相殘殺、（如檢舉ＡＢ團·改組派·以恐怖政策、鎭壓反叛分子）、至今仍流竄他處者、爲數亦極有限矣、</p>
<p>至收復土地之處理法、係據三省剿匪總部所頒剿匪區内土地處理條例十三十五兩條之規定、由縣府佈告登記、由業主領取管業證書、按照田地原界、恢復原有地權、各自耕作、匪化時、曾做重要工作、或腦筋敏活者、尤其識字青年、則調入公署所辦之感化院、施以特殊敎育、三月畢業、得返原鄉、</p>

<h3>兩無線電臺事務員昨因不滿待遇罷工</h3>
<p>交通部令限即返臺服務</p>
<p>逾期不到一律除名解僱</p>
<p>交通部所屬之國際無線電臺、及上海無線電總臺事務部職員、因不滿交部規定之待遇、於昨晨零點五分宣告罷工業誌昨報、交部昨令兩臺登報、限期飭各員返臺服務、否則一律解僱、茲誌詳情如下</p>
<p>電員優遇　電臺職員、計分技術（卽工程師等）報務（卽發電等）事務、（卽櫃上收報送報收賬會計庶務等）三部、技術員待遇每月至少七十元、最多爲三百六十元、報務員自三十二元至三百元、事務員由三十二元至一百六十元、薪俸在四十元以下者、每晋一級加薪三元、四十元以上者每晋一級加四元、最多晋一級加十元、</p>
<p>考績晉級　交通部新近頒布業務章程内載考績晋級辦法、每六個月舉行考績一次、分特優（三分）優良（二分）平常（一分）三等、考績每滿六分者晋一級、卽可按照原薪增加、同時并規定每一電臺、人數總數三分之一、可享受特優等、故每年須有二次特優、方能晋一級、如每次均爲平常、須三年晋一級、</p>
<p>要求改良　事務員之職務、因較其他二部人員爲輕易、故每次考績、特優等鮮得享受、至少須一年半方能晋一級、交部對於技術員每月并津貼十二元至五十元、報務員每月津貼八元至三十五元、事務員則獨付缺如、故曾要求依例津貼、每月至少十六元、并更請求改革考績制度、</p>
<p>宣告罷工　兩電臺共有事務員一百五十四名、曾於本月二十六日、聯名呈請各該臺長官、對於津貼考績二點、請求轉呈文部改革、然呈上後、迄未奉批答、各員認爲部内不允所請、故於今晨零點五分、掉班時期、全體離局、宣告罷工、</p>
<p>報務無礙　兩臺以各事務員事前雖有要求改良之舉動、然未有限期答復之消息、故均未有任何準備、惟事務員之職務、究屬不甚重要、昨晨七時前、卽由技術報務人員暫時兼代、并急電交部請示、一面并向各分局臺及大北大東太平洋三水電公司抽調人員應付、故報務并不因此發生障礙、</p>
<p>部主嚴辦　國際無線電臺及上海各線電總臺、於昨晨零點十五分、電部請示後、於下午四時零五分、得部内復電、略謂事務員罷工而去、可卽日刊登申新兩報、限各員返臺繼續服務、如過期不到、一律除名解僱、兩臺奉令後、已定今日登報召集云、</p>
<p>員工態度　又據罷工人員方面云、爲局方無負責切實之答覆、所以態度非常堅决、日經全體簽字、一致要求五項條件、並無若何背景、該點早爲兩台主管人員所深切了解、但事件倘遷延擴大、其責任當由當局獨負云、</p>

<p>試飛計劃　中航公司自完成滬平·滬渝·滬粤·三大幹線後、即着手籌備開闢西南航線、並於本年十月間、由渝試飛二次、均因天氣惡劣、飛至桂陽中止、故此次改變計劃、由漢口起飛、經長沙至廣州、停息一宵後、再飛至梧州南寗而至龍州度夜、次日再經過昆明、而直達重慶、届時如天氣良好、或將繞道桂陽一行、蓋全線氣候、以桂陽爲最惡劣、故預定如天氣不良、則直飛重慶云、</p>

<p>因霧順延　該機定昨（二十八日）晨由漢起飛、旋因漢口至長沙、發現大霧、該公司爲愼重安全計、遂中止起飛、目下西南之氣候、頗爲晴朗、一俟長沙霧止、即將開始試飛云、</p>

<h3>鐵道業務與聯運之來年計劃（續）</h3>
<p>鐵道部業務司司長兼聯運處處長俞棪</p>
<p>（戊）增加運輸能力　鐵路必先有充分之設備、始能供給充分之運輸、而在最重要之各項設備中、車輛實佔居其一、現在吾國各路大半均感車輛缺乏、固因根本上車輛卽不充足而運用時車輛虚糜甚多、尤足以以使缺乏程度、益形深刻、處此情况之中、欲使各路得有充分之車輛、一面固應儘量利用已有之車輛、使達其最高效能、一面亦應設法新添車輛、以圖根本上之救濟、關於前者、棪自到職以來、曾按照十九及二十年份各路貨物延噸里及貨車噸數之統計、表顯各路車輛運用效率之程度、藉以隨時稽核車輛運用成績之需、現復從事訂定改善車輛支配辦法、來年内當可見諸實施、此外則隨時注决設法縮短各路車輛之裝卸運得時間、趕修損壞之車輛、及了取締軍人之扣留車輛等、以期增進車輛之週轉效能、關於後者、計劃略如下述、竊嘗研究添置車輛之方法、暫可分爲四種、一則租用、此法自能救濟一時之緊急、但車輛是否隨時可以租得以應急需、不無問題、二則自製、此法勢難實現、緣鐵路機廠多僅具修理之設備、若擴大機廠組織、製造車輛、則非短速時間所能成、亦非現在財力所能辦、三則欠欵購買、與售主訂立條件、規定付欵手續、而以所購之車輛爲抵押、四則現欵購買、此法如能籌集現欵、最爲簡捷、茲詳細斟酌部路情形、擬先授用最後之法、由本部籌劃欵項、代各路定購輛車、俟車輛到後、分租各路使用、核收相當租金、以作存償車輛本息之用、此事現正在計劃中、以上所述、關於增加運輸能力之意見、係僅就車輛而言、欲增加運輸能力、自不止限於車輛問題、其他設備如各站岔道之應如何添置、調車場之應如何擴充、以利車輛之週轉等、於可能範圍以内、亦擬設法改進也、</p>
<p>（己）改善鐵路貨物運價　凡一國鐵路所訂運價適當與否、不惟影響其本身營業至鉅、卽對於物價之昂賤、貨品之流滯、地方之榮枯、人民之文野、以及各種實業之盛衰、全國人民生活之優劣、在在均有密切之關係、其應精密研究、審愼規定、自不待言、吾國剏辦鐵路之初、規定運價權操外人、對於吾國情形、旣多隔閡、關於運價原理、復欠研究、任意厘定、漫無標準、甚或以外商之利益爲前提、置國貨之運費負担力於不顧、繼修之路、又皆不加考核、茫然抄龔、以致各種貨物運動、多欠允當非失之太高、卽失之不平、實有整個整理之必要、况近因辦理負責運輸、各貨運價加收一成、加價後之運價是否適當、影響如何、亦須加以審核與改善、故擬就核成貨物運價之各項要素、分特根本整理、（一）現在貨物等級分六等、擬詳加研究、酌量增爲十等（二）基本運價各路懸殊甚鉅、擬設法計算各路之運輸成本、再根據運輸成本而厘定之、（三）在可能範圍内、使各路盡一遞遠遞减構成方法、先從里程略等之路盡一之、（四）各等間運價高低之比例、各路之間參差不齊、卽同一路綫亦不一致、擬互相比較詳細研究後分别整理之、（五）整車運價與不滿整車運價相差之比例、有爲百分之三十者、胡爲百分之五十者、尙有其他比例數者、擬切實研究後整理之、（六）整車貨物起碼重、量吾國各路迄無規定、以致對於鬆笨貨物之運價、每苦無妥善之計算方法、現正從事於各種貨物對於各種車輛起碼重量之規定、一俟規定就緒、公布施行、不惟可解决鬆笨貨物之重量問題、而整車運價與不滿整車運價相差之比例、亦可藉以謀妥當之决定也、總之、吾國鐵路貨物運價多欠妥善與公平、要當本一面發展鐵路營業、一面振興國内產業之精神、以爲根本整理之計、雖呈體重大、或非短時期以内所可成事、然固不敢不竭其所能以謀整飭也、</p>

<h3>平民的慈母</h3>
<p>— 瞻廬</p>
<p>南檐納日冬天暖，冬天的日光，有說是黃棉襖子，有說是天然火爐，這都是局部的比喻，說一句概括的話，簡直是平民的慈母。</p>
<p>平民止步的熱水汀房間，當然是有產階級的快樂之宮。要是生就了一副苦命的骨頭，只配在風雪中奔走，冰霜裏討尋生活；偶然想在快樂之宮的門前休息一下子，不是受那豪奴的呵𠮟，定是遭那瞧人不起的鬆毛獅子狗大聲狂吠。幸而，只有勢利的人，勢利的狗，却没有勢利的陽光，凡是茅屋菩檐，一切資產階級走不到的地方，這位平民的慈母也會光臨，也會擁護着許多凍手僵足渾身顫動的窮苦百姓，而給予以相當的慰藉。</p>
<p>每逢朝暉透露的時候，酣眠在銷金帳中的有福之人，都是籐模沉沉</p>
<p>地不放這光線透入，因爲他們不需要這陽光耀眼的緣故。惟有凍的鼻涕垂垂的一般貧民，望見朝暉，便投入大自然的慈母懷抱裏面，條條光線都是他們的生命線；縱使衝着寒冷做他們的勞苦生涯，但在慈母擁護之下，多少總可以减除他們的苦痛。忽的，一片彤雲，罩住了平民的慈母的臉，銷金帳中的人，十分高興地起來預備着開筵賞雪的請柬，可憐一般平民，失却了慈母的擁護，又是鼻涕垂垂的度那可憐的寒宵。</p>
<p>記得有一位經學大師，記他的幼年貧苦史，爲着破被褥内抵禦不住長宵的苦寒，他和他的　母親背貼着背坐着，以待天明；直到朝暉破露，方才欣欣然有生意。可見徹貧的人，便有慈母擁護着貼背而坐，依舊解不得寒冷，一定要這位高高在上的慈母在雲端裡露臉，才有死裏逃生的希望；從來的詩人，只把慈母比春暉，其實不是春晖。，平民的慈母，只有這暖如挾纊的冬暉。</p>
<h3>清季外交史料評述</h3>
<p>— 達</p>
<p>研究清季外交史之原則有三：一曰信而有徴，二曰詳實淵博，三曰有新文件。蓋民國外交，大率肇端於清季，其時重要文件，例不宣洩。編輯史籍者，或根據國人之著述，或採錄外人之記載，一麟半爪，無由窺見全豹，誠爲憾事。余讀王弢夫氏及其哲嗣希隱所輯之清季外交史料一書，覺於此三項原則，確有新買獻，略述如次：</p>
<p>一，清制以親王領袖軍機，兼管總署。凡重要文件，雖未鈔發，百軍機處則無所不備。清季外交史料，係弢夫氏供職樞密時所搜集。此中文件，關於不平等條約，領事裁判權，關稅不自主等成立之程序，及外部與各使會議語錄，悉屬搜羅靡遺，可謂信而有徴矣。</p>
<p>二，清季外交，最稱繁重。烟臺條約，西藏交涉，佔據缅甸，並片馬香港威海九龍等案。如中美交涉之保護華僑，公斷專約，退還賠欵等案。如中法交涉之法越搆爨，中法戰爭，粤滇桂界務，並廣州灣四明公所等案。如中日交涉之中日戰爭，割讓琉球臺灣，日韓合併，歸還遼旅，並沙市長崎二辰丸延吉東沙島旅大天寳山木植漁業及東三省等案。如中德交涉之出兵山東，租借膠澳等案。如中俄交涉之歸還伊犂，租借旅大，中俄密約，日俄戰爭，交還東三省，及松黑兩江行船等案。如中意交涉之三門灣天津鹽垞等案。凡此各種外交詳情，在普通史書中所未備載者，皆可於是編徴之。甚爲詳實淵博。</p>
<p>三，在此書中，載有未經出版之新文件頗多，如光緒六年摠署因中俄伊犂問題，與日本恊訂之約。如中法安南問題交涉之往來文件。如甲午中日戰爭將起之時，李鴻章翁同龢　人會議和戰奏摺。如中日戰後，李私請赴俄與訂密約之經過文件。如拳匪變時，李由粤至滬，請朝廷自行引過之文件。其尤可珍貴者莫如宣統朝之外交史料，今日坊刊極少，可謂全部皆係吾人所未經見之文件。今日東北四省之亡，實皆基於此項文件之中。茲并略舉其大者數項：如中日會議東省各案之文件。中韓爭界各案之文件。俄侵東三省及新疆邊界之往來文件。駐外各使，對俄日秘密恊約之報告文件。凡此種種，皆係歷來從未公佈者也。</p>
<h3>男女</h3>
<p>— 斌</p>
<p>阿寳姐從上海回到楊村，早已是金裝玉鏤，一個二十九歲的人，在楊村人看起來，還不同十六七歲的大姑娘一樣妖艷嗎？</p>
<p>阿炳哥眼看着阿寳姐闊綽得熱鬧，好不眼紅，也定了個黃道吉日，向上海一溜，隔了三年，阿炳哥回來了，依舊是一個衣衫襤褸的窮措大！</p>
<p>上海是一樣一個的上海，楊村是一樣的一個楊村，不過改竇姐是個女子，阿炳哥始終是個男子罷了！</p>
<h3>混血兒</h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>我在本刊發表過的幾篇文字中，似乎常常帶到中國人怎樣怎樣的廢話，或許有人會懷疑我不是中國人。</p>
<p>這點，我也覺得很内疚。但想來想去，　要我們中國人身上似乎又找不出良好的印象。這點，凡是智識階級的中國人，都能感到。那末，我能說什麽呢！</p>
<p>我之所以糾纒着中國人嘰咕，雖不敢懷有「針砭世俗」的宏願，但希望「中國人好」的熱情，自信是不落人後的！不過中國人能不能好，那是另一件事。如果以爲嘰咕，而没有成效，就放棄嘰咕，這是錯誤的！</p>
<p>誠如本刊編者所說：「中國的希望，在於今日一般兒童」，我也曾找出許多機會和他們談話，不過他們所能給我的，多少總有些「失望」！尤其是「混血兒」使我覺得特别傷心！</p>
<p>我曾找到個父親是華人母親是美國人所產生的約有七八歲年紀的兒童。他和我厮混得很熟，常常拿着面青天白日旗來我處玩。我指着他手中的小旗用英語—因爲他不能操國語—問他：「這是什麽」？他回答我：「這是一面國旗」。</p>
<p>我說：「這是美國的國旗麽」？回答是：「不，這不是「我們」的國旗，這是「你們」中國的國旗」！</p>
<p>啊！你想，他腦海裏居然早就深印着「你們」「我們」的稱謂了！這小東西！</p>
<p>我再問他：「你爸爸拼命敎你寫中國字，說中國話，看中國書，你不是一個中國人麽？你願否做個中國人中呢」？他回答我：「不，我願意是個日本人」！我問他爲什麽？他說日本飛機比中國的厲害，同時他做着手勢，鼓着小嘴，很有節奏的「嗚……砰……砰……」地在喊。似乎在指示我炸彈掉下來的情形」！</p>
<p>這當然難怪我光火。我就大聲地喊出句“Shut　up”！底下句，“Get　out”還没有出口，他早就溜掉了！」</p>
<p>此後他就没有敢見我的面，這點，我倒覺得很痛快的！</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第二十一回　絮語燈前苦心訓弱息　杖游山下冷眼看英雄</p>
<p>桂枝往日對於母親說話，必是說一句頂撞一句。可是到了今天，不知是何原故，母親這樣說着，好像話裏有話，自己也不敢多言，低了頭走進自己臥室去了。他越是這樣，江氏倒偏是起了疑心，在屋子裏坐了一會，推開屋門來，向天上望着，一個人自言自語道：喝！一會兒工夫，陰雲佈滿了，今天晚上，也許又要下雨了，到外面瞧瞧天色去，不下就好，明天我還要拆蓋被褥子洗呢。他口裏說着，人就果然走出去了。到了大門外，街坊兩個小孩子，還在路邊玩，自己正想打聽呢，一個小孩子就迎上前來問道：楊家媽，你家大姐丢的鑰匙尋着了嗎？江氏道，你怎麽知道他丢了鑰匙呢，小孩向前面地上一指道：楊大姐，先在那裏發楞，尋了許久呢。江氏道：他不大向那邊走的，怎麽會走到那邊去呢？小孩道：你說我是寃枉你的嗎？不信，你回頭問問甘三爺，就知道了，他站在這裏，可和甘二爺說了好久的話呢，江氏聽了此言，不由得週身毫毛孔裏，出了一身冷汗，就瞪了小孩子一眼道：是我呌他和甘二爺討舊賬呢，他們有什麽話可說呢。口裏這樣的和桂枝解釋着，心裏却砰磁亂跳，想着桂枝這孩子，近來果然有些不對了。只看他，睡覺的時候，將甘二爺一張相片藏在枕頭下，就知道他和甘二爺話，那不是平常的約會談話了。當時把這事放在心裏，就有點行止不安。到了晚上，桂枝不知是故作鎭靜呢？還是無聊已極，他拿了幾張小報，在燈下來看。江氏也捧了一件新裁的布料，在燈下縫紉短褂子。母女兩個人，共抱了一隻桌子角坐着（二八０）</p>
<p>術跦听平</p>
<h3>閩游追憶（上）</h3>
<p>我在數月之前，曾經兩度到過閩省的省會福州。滄海凌波，生平還算第一遭，如此壯游，似乎不可無紀，但是懶蟲一般的我，拿起筆來寫字，實在覺得是一件很怕的事，因此因循許久，隻字未寫。近來見報載，十九路軍統治下的福建，又起風雲，時隔僅三月，情恍惚依希，拉雜寫來，總算是留着一點雪泥鴻爪罷了。</p>
<p>福州在我國南部，從上海去，大約舟行四十七八小時可到。據老於航海的人說：「南洋浪是軟性，此洋浪是硬性，硬浪好受，軟浪難當。」所以到福州去一路的浪，非常難受，但賦性倔强的我，無論什麽事，有些不買賬，以爲在上海黃浦江裡，乘着小舢板，儘是風狂浪大，從來不曾暈過船，難道在輪船中地位旣寛，就會暈船？豈知等到開出吳淞口，到寗波洋面時，頭裏早已靠不住起來，後來索性連坐都不能坐，飯也不能吃，只吃得一點粥，這一路的海程中，等於過了幾天病，直到輪船將抵馬江，船身漸穩，心裡才如醉後方醒，慢慢地覺得清爽起來，</p>
<p>馬江是福州一個咽喉，一名馬尾，又有馬凟江·馬頭江兩個名稱。那地方，山嶺重疊，港水頗深，可泊巨艦，輪船進口之後，紆迴曲折而行，但見四面皆山，等到山窮山盡，一個轉灣，又是綠波粼粼，青山重疊，别有天地。「山重水複疑無路，柳暗花明又一村。」此種境界，眞有令人說不出的愉快，福州之繫我夢魂者，馬江其一也。但是我兩到福州，經過馬江凡四次，每過一次，聽着嗚咽的流水，心頭總有一次不快，因爲這馬江在五十年前，大約是前清光緒十年間，法國艦隊擾我福建，馬江一役，便也是我國恥史上最傷心的一頁。所以每過一次，總是不勝欷歔憑弔。記得我曾經有兩句詩道；「流水應知亡國恨，怒濤吼作大獅聲。」便是在馬江道中做的。</p>
<p>馬江的形勢，的確非常險要，所以也是我國重要軍港之一。那裏有船廠，船塢，海軍醫院，海軍學校等等，可惜船過一霎，没有機會去一一參觀。</p>
<p>輪船在馬江抛錨後，便有許多人跳上來，問開龍洋要不要，起初聽得莫名其妙，後來才知開龍洋就是小汽油船，大概每艘在七八元左右，約莫兩個鐘點，可到福州城外的南台。</p>
<p>南台是鴉片戰後，五口通商時開闢的商埠，所以是城外一個最熱鬧的地方，基督敎青年會也在這裡，還有許多窰子和大旅館，市面是很興的。南台的前面，是閩江，流水湯了，晝夜不息，江中有小島，際一大橋爲兩，南橋曰江南，北橋曰萬壽，合計有一百四十丈長，工程很偉大的。橋下的流水，非常湍急，在漲潮的時候，尤其奔騰澎湃，勢如千軍萬馬。</p>
<p>福州的街道建築得很好，路也很寛，市政還算不錯。不過那裡的黃包車，搆造得實在不高明，坐在上面，一些都不舒服。福州特多一種榕樹，這種樹旣在幹上生枝，枝上又生出根夾，一直下垂至地，又變成幹，所以其蔭極大，它的葉子，是榕圓形而平滑，我們在路上走，處處可見。在厦天時候，濃蔭蔽日，却暑招風，榕樹是很有用的。講到它的產地，本來閩廣都有，不過福州尤其著名。所以福州還有一個别名，就呌做榕城。這是我的朋友Ｗ先生告訴我的。</p>

<h3>敎費獨立聲中蘇浙贛豫閩敎費已獨立</h3>
<p>但政府無此項主張更難籌基金</p>
<p>敎育部此次派大批視察各省市敎育人員十二人、已先後回部、關於視察之詳細報告、各員都在分别編製中、非年内所可發表、茲徧訪各員、將已到之各省市（計二十省市）省市敎育經費總數、及已否敎費獨立情形、探錄於下、</p>
<p>（一）江蘇省敎育經費完全獨立、設有江蘇敎育經費管理處、直接向江蘇各縣催征敎育專欵、按月分配各省各校及省敎育機關本年度實支經費約四百萬元、其中田賦與屠牙稅三百八十萬元學校行政收入二十萬元、（預算本列四百三十萬元、而實際上學校行政收入一項、因廳令不收學宿費、此二十萬元取消、財廳之補助費三十萬元、年來未付、本年因取消學宿費、在財廳所收漕米每石劃歸敎育兩角、折成實收數約二十萬抵補學宿費、則財廳所謂補助三十萬更不易付、故只得四百萬元、）</p>
<p>（二）浙江省敎育經費最近已獨立、省府議决浙省敎育專欵及支付辦法已照實行、浙省敎費共二百十萬六千餘元、其中箔類營業稅一百二十萬元、菸酒附稅二十萬元、屠宰營業稅六十萬元、</p>
<p>（三）南京市敎充經費、正在計劃準備獨立中、全市（社會局部屬各市校及市敎機關）敎費六十萬元</p>
<p>（四）上海市敎育經費、尙未獨立、全市敎費一百二十二萬餘元、</p>
<p>（五）安徽省敎育經費尙未獨立、全省敎費二百六十餘萬元其中一百二十萬由中央補助、餘爲省庫支給、</p>
<p>（六）江西省敎育經費、已經獨立、設有保管委員會監督用途、有敎費管理處按月將所向西岸榷運局領來之鹽附稅、分配各校及省敎機關、省敎費共二百萬元、</p>
<p>（七）湖南省敎育經費正在設法獨立中、據該省張財廳長對敎部科長吳研因談、明年下學期每月可劃八萬元、敎費可獨立、全省敎費一百九十二萬元、每月有中央鹽附稅十萬八千元、餘五萬二千元由省庫支給、中央補助不差、省費現領七折、下學期、恐將六折、故湖南省敎育、現感困難</p>
<p>（八）湖北省敎育經費、正在設法想獨立中、全省敎費二百四十萬元、</p>
<p>（九）廣東省敎育經費因制度方面無問題、故無獨立之必要、省敎費概算三百二十一萬零八千一百二十一元、（地方敎育經費在外）</p>
<p>（十）廣西省敎育經費、向不欠費、亦不謀獨立、省敎費三百四十三萬四千六百八十元、（地方敎育經費在内）、</p>

<p>（十六）察哈爾敎育經費亦難獨立、爲數二十四萬元、</p>
<p>（十七）山東省敎育經費、尙未獨立、省敎費三百零三萬一千三百九十九元、又地方敎育經費四百三十六萬五千一百四十三元、</p>
<p>（十八）青島市敎育經費尙未獨立、市敎費約五十三萬元、（記者因在半小時内、徧訪本届視察之、此一市因記不準確、故約略記之、）</p>
<p>（十九）河北省敎育經費、尙未獨立、省敎費三百四十萬元、</p>
<p>（二十）北平市敎育經費尙未獨立、全年市敎費九十六萬元、每月八萬元、其中有中央恊欵每月二萬五千元、</p>
<p>政府對敎費獨立之態度　日日社云、自九一八國難發生後、因國庫空虚、各省市敎育經費、更形艱窘、致有欠薪數月之久、茲爲推進敎育行政、力求整頓經費起見、各省市敎育當局、僉有經費獨立之主張、日日社京社記者、特以此事詢諸敎部負責人、據談我國自民十六迄今、連年戰爭、民窮財盡、以致敎育經費、不能按期撥發、實爲憾事、今各省要求經費獨立、似屬正當、第實行必須有相當之收入作固定經費、否則仍徒成盡餅、今集全國稅收以充國家軍政各費、尙不能彌補於萬一、遑論撥欵爲固定之敎育經費耶、至蘇閩兩省之敎育費、原已獨立、除閩省卒因某事已告失敗外、蘇省本有江蘇敎育經費保管會之設立、但最近該欵亦被挪用、致亦有拖欠情事、目前各國立大學、除淸華有中美庚欵作基金外、其餘均未獨立、若欲其實現、借政府仍無準備金、本部環顧時艱、在敎育經費未獨立以前、當謀全部敎育經費之平均云、</p>

<p>—踢來異常客氣—</p>
<p>江大體恊會足球錦標賽、已於昨日結束、暨南繼續覇權、昨對復旦一戰、在中華棒球塲舉行、雙方動作異常客氣、結果各一和局、眞眞和氣、</p>
<p>上半時兩無所獲　但因爲過份客氣、遂使局勢轉爲平淡、上半時互來互往、各無所獲、球到門前、如無機會、决不强求、雙方是乎有約在先、互不侵犯、如一切球賽、均能如此、則情感當然融洽、爭執不消而滅矣、</p>
<p>下半時各進一球　下半時賽約一刻鐘許、暨南由羅海光攻入復旦一球、但不三分鐘、復旦由陸秀文還中一球、結果遂成一比一和局、暨南遂以五勝一和之成績、連得錦標、陣線與各隊成績如下、</p>

<h3>之江籃球隊昨敗於西青乙</h3>
<p>今日下午戰交通</p>
<p>西青籃球暨南勝南星</p>
<p>昨晚西青籃球、除乙組比賽、明强以三十九比十八勝翼隊、甲組比賽暨南以四十比三十勝南星外、尙有一塲友誼比賽、卽來滬觀光之之江隊與西青乙隊、結果三十五比十八之江負、</p>
<p>明强勝翼隊</p>
<p>明强全隊頗有連絡、前鋒亦較活躍、翼隊後衛馬燦峯、極爲驍勇、平添全隊力量不少、戰幕初啟、翼隊領前、不久卽爲明强追出、一度相差有十一分之多、上半時十七比十一明强勝、下半時中翼隊槍法、益趨紊亂、遂一蹶不振、總結果三十九比十八、</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>論沉默</h3>
<p>— 吳溪</p>
<p>一九二四年，周作人先生曾經用三張紙來提倡「沈默」，但他並不是反對「噪聒」，而是由於「不得已」，說「這是對於現在中國的適當辦法。」周先生終於用了「三張紙」，可見得「沈默」究竟是辦不到的事。</p>
<p>杜衡先生說，在這個時代裏，只有聰明人是「沈默」的，可是聰明人到底少得很。</p>
<p>「沉默」唯大聖大賢能之，世間多的是好說話的傻子；我如此想。</p>
<p>其實「沉默」究竟有什麽苦痛呢？很具體的，我到也說不出。王統照先生，在他的詩集「這時代」的序裏，他說過，「越是感觸多越寫不出，不能爬梳的心緒，不容易襯托出的時代的劇動，便甘心沈默，這眞有一種深重的苦悶！我以爲能夠哭，能夠喊呌，能夠唱，大笑，甚至於能以說幾句俏皮話，或者是無次序的亂吵，一個人的苦悶倒有所舒發，這彷彿重霍亂病中的嘔吐與排洩，即使身體上覺得空虚，至少他的精神上可得到暫時的快慰。」我想這是可以借來作解釋的。「沉默」之風的不振，由此觀之，其由來蓋已久矣。</p>
<p>於此，我想到林語堂先生的折中其事，提倡「幽默」，是不爲無因了。</p>
<h3>談寫實的小說與第一人稱寫法</h3>
<p>— 穆木天</p>
<p>現在，我們的青年們已經没有法子在象牙之塔中找安慰了。環境使他們的眼睛轉向現實，使他們注意到大衆的痛苦。在文藝的領域中，他們是要現實主義地表現出大衆飢寒凍餒的生活的。</p>
<p>近幾天來，在病中走馬觀花地翻讀了一些青年的小說作品。因之，更深切地感到這一種現象。這種現實主義的傾向，確是一個時代的象徴。</p>
<p>不過有一點使我深深的感到不滿：就是有些青年作家，在本心上是要現實主義描寫社會的，但因爲他們用第一人稱的寫法，便减少了那些小說作品的眞實味。</p>
<p>中國現在的小說的樣式旣還没有眞正地被建立起來，那些青年作家犯了這種毛病，自然是情有可原。遇着好多的材料，而同時找不到表現這種材料的至好的形式，把它合適地裝起來，於是盲目地利用舊的形式。而浪漫主義者所慣用的第一人稱的寫法，也被他們利用了。這種第一人稱的寫法，對於現代的寫實主義的小說，是否適用呢？這似乎還没有人討論過。這也許證明那些青年作家們，直至某種程度，還是浪漫諦克罷。</p>
<p>然而，這一種傾向，是極須糾正的。這一種傾向，是會把小說中的有生命的現實化成爲機械的公式。</p>
<p>這種傾向的作品是相當地多的。現在，只取草明女士的「傾跌」（文藝二期）作例罷。自然，從那篇「傾跌」看，草明女士是一位很有希望的青年作家。然而，正是爲她的前途遠大，所以她的缺點更大有矯正的必要。自然，從那篇「傾跌」看，草明女士是想盡力地去把握現實。然而，正因爲那種原故，越法暴露了她那種第一人稱的寫法同題材之不相適合，而減少了作品的眞實性。</p>
<p>偉大的寫實主義作家，如斯丹達爾（Ｓtendhal）巴爾扎克（Balzac），福羅貝爾（Flaubert），左拉（Zola），諸人，在作品中，是很少或者是没有用過第一人稱的。那種第一人稱的自白式的手法，是不能表現客觀的複雜的現實的。如果把繆塞（Musset），喬治，桑（GeorgeSand）的小說，同福羅貝爾，左拉的小說比較一下即可知其異同。</p>
<p>寫工人寫農民用第一人稱，是很難以使文章丨丨那文章是人物的自白丨丨與主人公丨丨自白者丨丨的身分相適合。譬如「楊媽的日記」·一見就知道是虚構的。楊媽的生活是可以客觀持描寫的。可是，呌楊媽寫出那一段漂亮日記來，則是滑稽了。那是作者的觀念的虚構而不是現實的。而且，一個主人公，也是不容易看到一個故事中的各方面的。</p>
<p>這種第一人稱的寫法，很容易使作者把他的人物理想化，而甚至過分地理想化。譬如，在「傾跌」裏，女人公是一個小老媽，而作者却把她寫成爲一個詩人了：「我在閒着的三個月裏，不絶地生出許多希望，和美麗的幻影，可是都一個個地跟大海裏觸着暗礁的船一樣地沉到那陰森而蒼鬱的魔窟樣的海底里」，「蘇七起了像沙漠上的，孤島底寂寞而貧乏的悲哀」等等很多的話語，恐怕不但一個女工說不出，想像不出，就是文科大學生也不一定人人能說出這一類有聲有色的話語。這一種美化，理想化，是有害於藝術的眞實性的。</p>
<p>現在，是不是在好些作品中有一種形式與内容不調和呢？如有的話，是急須克服的。</p>
<h3>書話（續）</h3>
<p>— 俊之</p>
<p>（五）</p>
<p>所以，愛書狂者，不僅愛書，也歡喜把讀書生活美化起來，如眉公詞所說的書屋的位置。李日華「紫桃軒雜綴」裏，曾有一個關於書屋的設計，其文曰：</p>
<p>書屋擇溪山紆曲處，結搆止於三間，上加層樓，以觀雲物。四旁修竹百箇，以招清風。南面長松一株，掛我明月。老悔偃蹇，低枝入窗；芳草褥苔，周於砌下。東屋置道釋二家書，西置儒籍，中横几榻之外，雜置法書名繪。朝夕白飯魚羹，名酒精茗。一健丁守閣，拒絶俗間往來。如此十年，鍾王顧陸則不可知，斷不在虞褚摩詰營丘華源下矣</p>
<p>書狂的意想，於此可見一斑。不過，「如此十年」的結果，所達到的，是否如他所期，則殊是一個問題也，一笑。</p>
<h3>「蒹葭蒼蒼白露爲霜」</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>丨丨在上海大夏大學講演</p>
<p>「蒹葭蒼蒼」·詩，秦風的一篇。那是一首戀歌，依我推測：當那個男人送他的愛人歸去的時候，兩人沿着河邊走了一陣，手攀了蒹葭的長葉相對站了一回；那女的終於過河去了，他倆是分别了。隔了許久時日，那女的並不曾回來，也許連一點音信也没有。那男的孤獨地在河邊來來去去，心中煩燥不安；忽然看見蒹葭的長葉，葉上鋪着一層浮霜；那長葉剌進了他的心，於是他低聲唱道</p>
<p>「蒹葭蒼蒼，白露爲霜。</p>
<p>所謂伊人，在水一方；</p>
<p>遡洄從之，道阻且長；</p>
<p>遡游從之，宛在水中央！」</p>
<p>假使有人發個呆問：「那男的爲什麽不過河去看他的愛人呢？」那也許女的父親是一位道學先生，不許他倆自由戀愛，連窗外都不許他徘徊，只索在河邊害相思病了。</p>
<p>相戀相愛，相思相慕，那是每個人極普通極平凡易得的經騐，所以寫愛情入詩篇，在文學題材中所佔成分最多。青年男女初入文學門阈的，也以看這種題材的爲多，上海就有許多文學家專靠寫這類作品過活的。旣是這樣普通平凡人人所易知的題材，寫起來應該十分容易；爲何蒹葭蒼蒼這一首無名作家的情詩，讓他獨步千古呢？又爲何三千年前這一位相思病患的情歌，在千百年後讀之，還是「先得我心」呢？這便是我今天所要談一談的。</p>
<p>要在愛人面前，展開我們的心囊，使她了解我們的狂熱，那是一件極艱難的工作。你將寫千言萬言的情書嗎？或是百行千行的詩歌嗎？也許你會失敗，全然失敗。表現情愛的最好方法，莫如一個字也不寫，一句話也不說；默默地兩人偎倚着在草地走，一句新月跟在後面，金銀花送過暗香來；這時，彼此的心房在躍動，雙頰在潮熱，眼皮在流注，還有比這更完滿的表現法嗎？</p>
<p>然而「不着一字，自得風流」的表現法，大家覺得不痛快似的；必得跪在地下說：「我愛你」，或是在信箋上寫「我是悄屬於你的」，這樣才算痛快。周作人先生說過：「我們在門外草地上翻幾個觔斗，想象那面高樓上的美人看著，很是高興，是一種辦法；反正她不會看見，不翻觔斗了，且臥在草地上看雲罷，這也是一種辦法。」我們常人大概是採取前一種辦法的。（不翻觔斗而着雲的方爲聖人。）</p>
<p>旣要翻觔斗才痛快，則觔斗之花樣出焉。詩人抒情，有賦比興三種花樣，蒹葭蒼蒼這首詩，用的是「興」的花樣。前人箋釋「興」義，說是「借物起興」；（劉額云：「文已盡而意有餘，興也，」李育云：「觸物以起情，謂之興，情附物也。」）那蒹葭的長葉，在送别時原是無意中各攀一葉；在河邊徘徊時，這長葉倒是第一個闖進心境的剌激，他就從牠寫起，用牠來表現這一番相思的情緒了。譬如這一張圓凳，太平淡無奇了；但若是我的愛人從前時常坐在這里，現在她已經死了，我一看見這張圓凳，便不禁愴然淚下，口裏哀吟道：「凳子呀！凳子呀！」好像我心頭的悲痛都寄託在這平淡無奇的圓凳上，又好像千頭萬緒的悲痛非得從圓凳子說起不可。因此「蒹葭蒼蒼白露爲霜」和「所謂伊人，在水一方」這兩件絶不相干的事，詩人把牠結連在一起，我們一點也不以爲異的。（鄭漁仲謂：「關關睢鳩，作詩者一時之興，所見在是，不謀而感於心者也。」就是這個意思。）</p>
<h3>兩兄弟（七三）</h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>（八）</p>
<p>哲安回到他自己家裏的時候，便倒在一張沙發上，因爲那使得他哥哥想像一隻被追逐着的獸類一樣跑且逃的悲哀與掛慮，在他那懶惰性情上却發生了另一種影響，彷彿把他的　和臂都折斷了。他覺得自己軟弱到不能再動一動，不能走上床去了，他的身子和靈魂一樣軟弱，疲倦，煩悶。他並不像筆爾一樣，在那種親子之愛的純潔上，在這包藏着驕傲之心的秘密的尊嚴上，受着了打擊，而是被那同時使他最寳貴的利益感着威脅的運命的一拳所壓服。</p>
<p>當他的靈魂終於寗靜了的時候，當他的思想終於像被人打着攬着的水一樣仍復明澈了的時候，他便審視着人家給他啟示了的那事態。假使他是從别的完全不同的方法，聽到了他的身世的秘密時，那他一定會憤怒，會感着深沉的悲哀；可是在和他的哥哥爭吵了一番之後，在有着這番震撼他的神經的猛烈而粗野的告發之後，他母親的自白的傷心的情緒，使得他再没有氣力反抗了。那給予他的惻隱之情的衝擊，竟厲害到使他在一種不可抗的感動之下，戰勝了一切先入見和一切自然道德的神聖的感受性。並且，他本來不是一個富於抵抗力的男子。他不喜歡和任何人鬥爭，尤其不喜歡和自己鬥爭；於是他放任了，並且由一種本能的趨向，由一種天生對於安寗，對於温柔且平靜的生活的愛好，他便立卽掛盧到那些將要在他周圍發生並將同時打擊他的混亂。他預料到這些混亂是不可避免的，爲着打破這些混亂，他决定以充滿精力與活動的超人的努力來應付。這困難問頭非是立刻，非是明天就把牠解决不行，因爲他有時也有着那立刻决定的强烈的需要，這需要組成那些不能持久的弱者所有的氣力。他那種慣於處理並研究複雜境况和發生糾紛的家庭内部問題的律師頭腦，卽刻發現了他哥哥的靈魂狀况將要發生的一切影響。他不由自主地，差不多以一種職業的見地來考盧這事的下文，他像受着一種精神方面的打擊之後，清算顧客們將來的關係似的。當然，繼續和筆爾接觸在他是不可能的。他留在家裏狠容易避免他，可是還有他們的母親也是不能再和她的長子住在一個屋裏的。</p>
<p>於是他一動也不動的睡在椅墊上，考盧了狠久，他想到一些計劃隨着又抛棄了，他没有得到一個滿意的。</p>
<p>可是他突然受着一個思想的剌激：他所收下的這筆財產，一個愛惜名譽的人會保留着嗎？</p>
<p>他起初回答：「不」，隨着便决定把它捐給窮人。這雖是狠可惜的事，也祇得罷了。他可把他的傢具賣掉，像别人一樣工作，像一切初出茅廬的人一樣工作。這雄壯且痛苦的决定鞭策着他，他立起身把額角靠緊玻窗，瞧着外面。他本來是没有錢的，他再回復成爲没有錢的。無論如何，他不會餓死。他的兩眼望着對面街上的煤氣燈。恰好這時有個歸家遲了的女人從行人道上走過，他便突然想到了陸醉米太太，他受到我們從一個殘酷的思想所發生的深沉的搖動。他的决定將發生的一切絶望的影響都同時在他面前出現了。他得放棄這個女人，放棄他的幸福，放棄他的一切。他能夠這樣嗎？現在他旣已和她許婚了？她應許了他的時候是知道他有錢的。他没有錢，她也許還會應許他；可是他有權要求她，强迫她以這個犧牲嗎？暫時留着這筆財產像一種抵押一樣，日後再還給窮人，那不比較好嗎？</p>

<h3>日用品商場的概述（二）</h3>
<p>（溪南）</p>
<p>蔬食，近來也隨信佛之風僵面行了。蔬食的菜館，如城隍廟，大新街東新橋及三馬路相近一帶都有。但是比較考究的菜館，當然要推功德林及覺林了。功德林本在北京路，自從該處房子改建湖社，乃遷居於派克路，覺林本在望平街，但以該處爲新聞業集中之所，故亦并而至霞飛路嵩山路口。吃素，在學佛的一方面，固然是戒殺，免得學報循環，輪廻往復。但如歐西之盛唱保護動物，其結果亦必歸於蔬食之一途。否則口頭祇管唱保護，而不惜屠宰以恣吾口腹，是豈保護動物之道，故欲澈底做到保護動物，自非素食不可。姑且置戒殺與保護動物於不論，卽如個人衛生起見，亦多蔬食爲是。魚易綏，肉易敗，故夏天的吃素，比較的爲多數，正是這個道理。古人力勸少食薰灸烤灼之物，謂其有傷腸胃，易生癰疽之症，此其言非從科學中研空出來乃從經騐中結晶而出，當然有一部分道理。然說者以外國人多薰烤之食，不聞其多患癰疽，是豈古人之言爲不可信。我非外國人，無由知外匣人肚腹中之情形，但從自己體騐及觀察所得，深覺古人之言仍不膠。何則？假使我們多食肉類之物，腹中恒覺不舒服，除非腸胃强健者，可是終究也要成病。這是甚麽緣故，因爲這類食物，不易消化，積滯腸胃中，自會發生毒質，入於血液，散佈周身，名曰自毒，非生内病，卽患外症，你看，外國人多服通便潤腸之藥，以及每飯之後，必食水菓，正爲欲藉藥品水菓之力，疏通積滯，但是終非治本辦法。因爲藥力，久之發生惰性，能消化之自然力，反而减弱；水菓於飯食之，並非完全相宜，其在我國，頗有飯後食水菓相戒，以爲驟熱驟寒，實非相宜，正見東西洋啫好之不同，亦以見吾國飲食，重五穀蔬菜，略參肉食正是最合於衛生的辦法，非西洋所能及。一則各種滋養料得以綢和，兼收並蓄，二則蔬食之中，大部分爲植物，富於葉綠素，有自然的潤腸通腸之功，不信，可以試騐，如久於肉食之後，而作一二次素食，其次立見，則蔬食在衛生上確占重要位置了。（待續）</p>

<p>（滬北）各路到船四十餘艘、市上各貨銷路仍不暢、白粳白元羊杜埠秈挺立、早薄稻陰元平定、</p>
<h3>客秈到銷兩淡</h3>
<p>—甬帮略有問津—</p>
<p>昨客秈市况、到煩甚微、去化亦呆、本街有河下米廳市、絶少問訊於客秈、客帮則閩省各帮一律停辦、北帮亦無進胃、惟昨有寗波帮趁小略辦、計辦成江西機晚一百二十包、價七元三角、湖南機油一百包、價七元一角半、其他均無交易、行情亦與前市相似、因近日市價已經跌到底碼、到頭亦乏、貨主不願再爲贬價售出、</p>
<h3>本月期粉交割八千包</h3>
<p>昨期粉停拍交割、期現粉均無交易、本月份標粉昨已經完全交割了結、共計交解棧八千包、計麥根七千包、祥新亦有一千包、均係回籠棧單、由北帮及囤户收去、</p>
<h3>黃豆下檔貨轉升二三分</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆氣象轉平、上中貨仍明平而暗鬆、惟下檔貨廠家辦胃稍動、故市轉砌二三分、昨共成交各豆六七車、内地帮辦一車、本街交易三四車、出口厦門帮問訊一二百包、計開正陽關豆三車、價爲三元五角至四角四分、歸德豆二車、價三元四角半、穎州豆三車、價三元三角半、至二角六分、濉溪口豆三車、價三元三角至二角七分、蚌埠豆四車價三元二角三至一角七分、</p>
<h3>糖市國產青糖開價續鬆</h3>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢仍無起色、分會劃盤二四粗砂白普通劃十九元半、又小一角、轉口貨呌六元七角半、原價但乏成交、亦看再小、二十號中砂白無成交約十九元四角、八九號荷赤劃十五元七角、無上落、太古糖平定、Ｂ嘜二十元一角半、ＣＷ嘜二十元、振記棉白開原價、一號爲十八元五角半、餘照退、片青開價亦降、昨成交二百餘箱、價九元六角、比前跌去四角、潮青又開一百餘件、小去一角光景、爲十三元三角至十二元七角、新刁青續到二百八十件、尙在報關中、大約明日可以出貨開價有續鬆之可能、</p>
<h3>南北貨興泉桂圓水脚漲價</h3>
<p>成本勢將隨昂</p>
<p>興化泉川桂圓、自閩變以來、因輸運不便、進出久無續到、茲有某公司租得外輪一艘、名曰神佑、已開往興泉兩處承裝桂圓、據昨日電訊、不日將有運下、但水脚照前加起十分之五、故成本隨增、後市或有轉好希望、</p>
<h3>疋頭呢羢祇有零星去化</h3>
<p>時届年底、各業均謀結果、呢羢交易、因之自有一番寂况、昨公會上市氣平疲、貨價復現混沌交易以零星爲多西裝套謂花呢·大衣呢·平厚呢·麥爾登·馬褲呢等、交易較爲繁盛、毡呢鞋作塲購力甚健、惜祇屬零星、售價因時日關係、未能趨高、國產寛緊駱駝羢一元六角檔子、本街門市尙有零疋添購、二元餘之美術素駝羢、亦徴有成交、</p>
<h3>絲茶海外絲電昨仍不轉</h3>
<p>紐約白廠經有行無市　紐約生絲市場、近因年期近、世界經濟恐慌、一般進口商手中存絲積極抛售、更兼日絲濫跌傾銷、致華絲無人問訊、昨據本埠美絲商乾利等傳出消息、紐約華絲現存達三千七八百包、Ｂ級白廠經八十三分匀度每磅開價美金一元四角强、較標準日絲價高八九分、扯合華幣每包價不過五百元左右、依然有行無市云、</p>
<p>雙宮絲印銷不寂　邇來雙宮絲印銷尙不寂、本埠單宮絲廠雖均停工、而福綸雙宮絲廠尙在工作、上週中大英郵船出口計有雙宮絲四十包、運英轉運印度、</p>
<p>人造絲滬存三千箱　歐美人造絲、邇來進口不暢、滬存稀薄、茲查各經售洋行存底共祇三千箱左右、均因繳稅關係、分存滬東等海關棧房、至現市客銷、則因年關已届、銀根日緊、各客幫均暫停抛購、市氣沈靜云、</p>
<p>黃白廠經綢銷寥落　耶誕節甫過、海外絲電昨仍不轉、横濱日絲市價看漲、滬埠歐美各莊昨晨雖有廠經電報發出、崦各廠商索價較昂、電難轉期、市氣依然疲靜、昨祇内地綢門進黃白廠經八包、價仍不振、</p>
<h3>針秀眉略有走銷</h3>
<p>昨日洋莊茶市、土莊針眉·秀眉等綠茶、英商同孚、怡和等行、因補充缺額、略有進胃、全市共計談成七十五箱、售盤三十二元、市面較前見跌二三元、珍眉珠茶等項、依然無人問及、一般土莊廠家、鑒於洋莊銷路不振、紛紛停工歇業、市情至爲寥落云、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>人類的惰性</h3>
<p>— 韋拔</p>
<p>走在馬路上，聽到小販喊賣舊曆新曆本，不禁發生一種感想：人眞是惰性的動物。</p>
<p>曆本的作用，原爲騐取彼此間的時日，但取其通行，無所謂國界。那末，旣有了陽曆，爲便利計，自不必保守着那古志而又不通行的「陰曆」，而沾沾自喜。然而有一般人却寗願捨棄了「方便」，而選取「不便」的，這又有什麽理由可以解釋呢？除了說是人類的惰性生成以外。</p>
<p>人類的惰性，又並不止此。除去遺老遺少的拖髮辫，題「春王正月」的不算，在社會上日常生活中所看到的，如結婚時，仍有用大紅花轎，鼓樂吹打，滿街迎走，保持着古代掠奪婚烟的遺跡。出喪時由許多小童，穿了古代袍褂（結婚時也用），打着「誥封」「清贈」一類的硬牌。訃文上仍刻着「清封ＸＸ」等字樣。恢復讀經。放棄通行的白話文，大做其古色香的唐宋八家的文章。與才造共和，又想到專制等等都是。</p>
<p>人類對於過去的依戀，就證明他是對於創造力的薄弱。而問題的解决，則在於前進，創造，而不在於回憶，復古。人類只有在永遠不息的前進中，得到解放，回憶，依戀是無補於事實的。</p>
<p>譬如没飯吃，我們可以想方法使有飯吃；没衣穿，我們可以想方法使有衣穿；没工做，我們可以想方法使有工做；一切問題，除了你自己不想解决以外，並不是全没有辦法的。而人類却安於簡陋，安於貧困，安於飢寒，一任一二野心者的支配，而又不能不呌「窮」，呌「苦」，喊天。放棄了自己的努力，而怪社會不凑合自己，這事又何從說起呢？</p>
<p>啊，人類原是這樣的習於懶惰啊！</p>
<h3>現代的文人</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>在新文壇上很有地位的詩人朱湘先生，最近投水自殺了。這年頭，死人本來就不算一回事，何况是一個與財，勢，權三字絶不相干的文人！所以我揣想想朱湘先生之死，除了在少數對人生意味有深刻而沉鬰之體騐的知識分子之間，能引起若干的感歎和同情而外，在輕裘煖帶，正當紅運的人物中，是不會有同情之淚，來爲這不幸的詩人「糟蹋」的。</p>
<p>因爲詩人朱湘之死，使我想起三年前自殺的小說家顧仲起和前不久被貧病交攻而死的作家彭家煌。這三人的死難有自殺與病故的不同，但爲現實社會所扼，潦倒焦瘁，以致賷志而殁的凄情慘遇，却是如出一轍。</p>
<p>用「文人薄命」這一句陳爛調來悼惜以上各位人生旅途中的戰敗者，是最空而庸俗不過的。本來，從古代以迄現在，文人或詩人之中，原是幸運者絶少而不幸者最多；爲了說話的便利起見，也未嘗不可以「命」之一字來籠而統之。但同同時必須認清：文人的「有命」或「薄命」，並不是决定於天，實在還是决定於人：一半决定於帝王，貴族，富豪，要人，名流的好尙和需要，一半决定於文人自己的自處。像大詩人李白，也曾有一個醉臥長安，睥睨公卿的時候，却並不是因爲他在那時是「文星高照」，而是因爲適逢歌舞承平，鼙鼓未動之際，在君王貴妃的宴權雰圍中，需要像李白這樣一個不加藻飾，濃艷天成的詩人點綴其間。然而李白後來，却仍然免不了淪落江湖，頽廢而死；因爲他終於生「壞」了幾根崚　的傲骨，在廟堂宮闈之羣的心目中，不能成爲一個永遠可喜的裝飾品。此外，在歷代的文人中，被贬謫，放逐，殺戮或困頓而死的，不知凡幾，而走時運或有「命」的，確是非常之少。</p>
<p>到了現代，人類的生活方式雖然是已極聲光化電，變化離奇之妙，但是文人或詩人之必須從「配合社會統治展之精神需要」的原則中去找「一登龍門」之道，却不因「革」了不止一次的「命」而稍有轉變。這社會當然還是需要文人的，不過所需要的，絶不是像朱湘一類很忠實的謳歌自然或人生，從自己感覺的透視中抒寫意境的詩人，而是另外的兩種：一種是長於筆墨的「技人」或「文匠」，能夠替「要人」「偉人」「聞人」一類的人物寫通電，八行，絶句，對聯和一切應酬文字，如四六文電專家的饒漢祥，專做反安福系反親日賣國電報的白堅武等是。還有一種是長於投擲某種恰到好處之諂媚文字的詩人，如工於頌聖的鄭蘇戡，在「九一八」兩年前就獻「張上將軍弭兵頌」，因而獲得萬金之報的樊山老人等是。可是，像詩人朱湘所寫的那一類意境淡遠，運筆輕逸的新詩，却完全不同於現在上層人物所需要的文藝格調，只可爲知者道，不能對「要人」言，旣不能當作「雷厲風行」的檄文，也不能作爲粉飾太平的文告，同時又不能贬價到兩塊一千字出賣，以便替書賈資本家們造財產。然則除了受到社會的漠視，受到一般人的冷遇而外，這冷酷的社會何曾爲詩人留着「出路」！所以，詩人的焦瘁，詩人的幻滅以至詩人的自殺，差不多已是事實所預定的結論。</p>
<p>處在這樣一個混亂到無以復加的年頭和國度，文人的出路原來就有類於「老鼠挖牛角，越挖越緊」。瞻前顧後，認肖現實，只有三條出路：其一，是站在舊社會勢力的對敵方面，絞自己的腦汁去爲被壓迫者，掙扎反抗的遭際呼號，其二，貼在舊社會勢力的尾巴上硬爬，那些「曾左哀榮錄」以及「我公不出，如蒼生何」的「敲門磚」或肉麻歌訣，讀得瓜滾爛熟，靠自己的筆鋒和面孔，去侍候一切「生張熟魏」的權要。其三，認清自己的潦倒不遇爲「理之當然」，旣不標榜「安貧」也莫認眞「憎命」暫時渾渾噩噩的過日子。</p>
<p>不幸詩人朱湘，竟走了第三條路而又不能泯滅自己的智慧，結果就成爲「無路」，他終於戰勝不過現實，竟至自殺了！</p>
<p>致無限的悼意於朱湘先生，同時希望潦倒作家之羣若竟讀吾文者，亦將有所動於中而檢查一番自己所走的路！</p>
<h3>瘋了</h3>
<p>— 詩農</p>
<p>「張阿虎，明年的田不給你種了！」田主老爺嚴厲的說着。兩隻眼睛射住一個中年的農夫。</p>
<p>「老爺……實在……」呌張阿虎的即中年農夫流着淚哀求着。「實在老天不生眼，大的兒子給拉夫拉了去，生死不知，二兒子又染着病……今年收成又不好，米價又賤，一共種十二畝田，糶得米來，還牛錢，餅錢，贖當頭，吃藥還不夠，現在勉强凑弄了這幾元，讓我還了一點舊欠吧！這一熟欠到明年，春花時一定還你，明年的田，仍舊讓我種。田主老爺，你看我一家老小面上，行行好事吧！田主老爺，我是十幾年的老佃户了，年成好，一向没有欠過的，……田主老爺……田主老爺……」</p>
<p>「不要　囌！」田主老爺不耐煩起來了。「今年的你還了，明年的田我已呌彭阿虎種的了！」說着便走了進去。</p>
<p>張阿虎流着淚痛心地走出了田主李鄉紳家生漆的大門。</p>
<p>「媽，痛呀！痛呀！」病着的孩子在黑暗的床上哼着呌痛。</p>
<p>農婦縐着眉，哭泣着安慰她唯一的剩下的兒子阿牛。</p>
<p>「好兒子，靜靜的吧，不要緊的，等一會兒，你父親買了藥還來，吃了就會好的。」</p>
<p>「痛呀，痛呀！」孩子還是哭着哼。</p>
<p>農婦心痛地去開了門，等丈夫還來。</p>
<p>天慢慢地黑下去了，孩子的哭聲也漸漸啞了。遠遠的一個黑影顚顚倒倒的走來，農婦趕了過去。</p>
<p>「阿牛的爸！怎樣了？」</p>
<p>「他媽的！那田主……可惡……來年的田已給彭阿虎種了……該死的，那傢伙！……」</p>
<p>「你又喝了酒，是不是？」</p>
<p>「管他娘！白干兩斤，吃了再講！管他娘！……那田主……那彭阿虎的賊……該死的！……」</p>
<p>「阿牛的爸，藥呢？」農婦問他正經事。</p>
<p>「錢都喝了酒了！」</p>
<p>「你這個殺千刀啊！放着兒子病得這樣兇也不管，只曉得喝酒，我與你併了命吧！」農婦哭着撲去。</p>
<p>忽然，那張阿虎圓睜着兩眼，握起拳頭對凖了妻子腦門打去，嘴裏說：</p>
<p>「你這忘八：你好！……打死你這彭老虎！」</p>
<p>農婦嚇得逃進門去，張阿虎也跳了進去。</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>門裏孩子的聲音在呌着「痛呀，痛呀！」</p>
<p>一星期後，全村都知道張阿虎這人是瘋了。田横頭又多了一個小棺材。（完）</p>
<h3>妻</h3>
<p>— 郝求</p>
<p>自我高舉了「反叛」的旗幟以來，曾遭着家庭歌酷的「圍剿」，好在還得到了頭腦清醒的弟妹們的同情與伸援，於極度的高熱的火併裏突圍而出，然而，這時節就已纒有了一個名義上的妻子丢在家中，並因家庭矛盾的繼續擴大與深入，弟弟亦起而要求婚烟自由，就這樣大大的揭啓了反封建式統治　　的序幕。現在，爲時已逾七八載了，弟弟的舊婚約早已婚前解除，只是本身事件不獲約束，大約是要嚴懲我這「戎首」，「反叛」　午？但我遠遠不屬於他們的了。</p>
<p>弟弟妹妹都各自有了他或她的結晶品，妻簡直僅會信我一定不得生長一根「尾巴」以外，丨知道我傲骨的丨如有人說我還是個「孤人」流浪着總是不相信的。但到了無法解悶時節，會去呌僕人找瞎子來算算命的，她。</p>
<p>本來，她的命運就是「瞎子」一眼看到透了注定的，母親知道了這個三媳婦要是將來的家中頂能幹的人物，所以才多多賞了瞎子的錢，便走書報喜，早點接來受她底敎育，以好大展鴻才的。如今，母親逝世了，可商量的當然只有母親的顧問丨瞎先生。丨就這樣的，她度過了六年又是第七年。</p>
<p>聽說這次算命先生作了切實的結論：［一定還有兩位「相公」添，只要過了這一年」，然而大的前提，當然是「破　　　］，過了這一年就是　年之所設，但據我所知道的，「兩位相公」的　添，該是換掉這原先的大前提，才有點可能性。</p>
<p>又聽說，這次算命先生受賞超過了母親的多少倍。並且自那一日起，毒的憔悴的顏容上時而有從心的深處出發的微笑輕輕地侵過。</p>
<p>大約是黃昏已經擴散浸潤着大地的昨天將晚吧！來了位初交而似老友的一位同學；稍憇之後，若有大的新發現般驚呌了一聲，凝視着我！「蜜司特郝，完婚了？」因初見乃用蜜「特發向也。我不自然的說「對」後，連接的來了一句你「尅妻」，我没有了笑容，「你看你的兩眼角多高」，來了他「科學的」論據，彷彿怕我不相信的，我搖搖我的頭，輕輕地，「我的話靈騐，你底老婆壽不大；上月某公務人員之「遭兇」，就是先說過不久……」又這樣似乎所謂客觀的，而同道來者也：「有這樣地事」的響應着：陰影襲上我的面孔，心裏想像有話說。一晌，他又進逼向前了：「你底妻，明年就要死去！」我的口没有多說話都渴了！「一定的」說了之後，似乎怕我焦心吧，「相，頂難看的，最好的或是最壞的相看來倒一點不差！」</p>
<p>我默念着我的相與妻的命，妻的明年，兩個「明年」，假若說有兩個「明年」就該是多活兩歲，一加一，實在是等於二！旣不如瞎先生的「明年」也不騐友人的「明年」我倒覺得有點靈了！現在不是說有了所謂折衷主義這個東西可存在世界上了嗎？</p>
<h3>生死之際</h3>
<p>— 立齋</p>
<p>最近有一位名呌費爾·達姆的英國人在倫敦每日捷報上登載一個奇異的廣告，向一切親戚友好表示「與其死後贈我花圈。不如活時叨光現錢！」我讀了這一切奇怪的新聞以後，不禁掩報歎曰：「如費爾達姆其人者，憤世疾俗，頗能俏皮則有之，然於人生眞意義之理解，則尙有未足也！」何以言之？請觀下文！</p>
<p>在往古來今，任一時代社會中，向棺材流淚的「同情者，」滔滔者皆是，而「扶危濟困」的好人，原來就非常之少。這並不是由於一般人的厚死薄生，而是在無形的處世哲學中，許多人對於禮尙往來的應酬，都加以有深意存焉的利用，把婚喪慶弔等事，都當作是人的「戰術」之一種。大家都習於幹「錦上添花」的捧場而視濟人急難爲畏途。逐漸推演，結果當然是「盛時則車水馬龍，衰敗則門可羅雀了」。至若對於死人加以諛詞或悼誄，則無論那死者爲闊公之老太爺抑或爲窮途之他鄉客，都是樂得予以哀悼，有益無損的。因爲，如果死者本人或其令郎的地位高出自己之上，則詞以輓之，　證明自己的交際是並不「推板」，所謂在場面上「兜得轉」是也。如果死者的地位在自己之下，則拿自己的大名綴在輓聯上，也大可藉以證明自己是雖然貴顯，但却「不忘故人。」如果死者是自己的政敵，甚至對於他的死，自己「帮過大忙」的，則更須輓他一輓，一則表示自己對於公怨私情，並不混淆，再者表示自己之「我不殺伯仁」的隱痛所謂「貓哭老鼠」者是也。有此三端，所以活着向朋友借錢，往往四處碰壁，但死了用訃文去向交淺的人討花圈輓聯，却又常是白無一失。不但如此，悼死和憐生，還有一個很大的不同，就是借十塊五塊給朋友，他在事實上不會對你「登報嗚謝」的，而且難免一回「得意」，二回再來麻煩；送輓聯花圈給死人就不然，在花圈或輓聯上，旣當然把「大名」高標着，同時那死鬼也絶對不會向你麻煩第二次。所以，向着已經蓋棺的死人揮「一掬同情之淚」的「仁人君子」們，比比皆是，而爲饑寒交迫的朋友解囊濟困的，則數不一覩！</p>
<p>以上所談，是對於一般向死人送禮的「同情者」們之心理的剖析，同時還要戳穿一點，就是一般扛了死人來廣收人情的「孝子賢孫」們的心理。在升沉都有竅妙的宦海之中，死了父母不簡單是一個丁艱（或憂）守制的問題，同時爲了顯視尤其是揚名起見，必須要乘機用直接或間接的方法，把所有主席，院長，委員長，部長和各名流老爺們的像讚題詞弄來，釘成很厚的一本，使那死去的男人，成爲「德在鄉黨」的聖賢，女的成爲敎子有方的今之「孟陶」，這樣，不但死者要含笑九泉（？），就是生者的「此馬來頭大」，也盡在不言中了。所以，小之如拉矢吃飯，大之如娶親死人，在中國的上層社會中，都是「有術存焉」的。</p>
<p>諛鬼的「仁人」太多，而救人的善士太少，此中國之所以糟糕到不到收拾也！</p>
<h3>希望之門</h3>
<p>— 雯</p>
<p>那是今年六月間的事。一位姓張的朋友因爲省政府的「緊縮政策」而將對於他所辦的通信社的津貼裁去，弄得飯碗跳舞。他當然是另起爐灶地再度掙扎，不過南京是有路子可鑽，故鄉也還有辦法可想，究竟重回故鄉呢，還是入京營謀呢？這「？」號竟在他腦海裏打起架來，弄得猶預莫决。最第後，他來找我。</p>
<p>「老陳！無聊死了！我對於自己的行止，想了又想，還是决定不下來，如果你没有别的事的話，我們一同出去跑跑，找人拆字或卜課……那自然是迷信，但是要把這樣的寃錢用去兩枚，我才痛快！横直悶在家裏是心如亂麻，想不出一個道理來……一那朋友的來意没有表白完，我就站起身來？</p>
<p>「好罷！陪你去玩玩，順便也領敎領敎海上的預言家……」話說完了，我就披了長衫，同他一道出去。</p>
<p>我們在新世界下車，首先就到西藏路一家旅館去找一位很有名的拆字先生。走上三樓，我們的預言家還没有來，據看場子的一個半大的孩子說：「請坐一坐，有半點鐘就可以來了……」筆潤是兩塊二毛，照例付過，聽那孩子的指使，點了一根香，插在香爐裏，又從那特製的「工具」内搖出了兩個字珠。</p>
<p>預言家老是不來，我和那朋友脫去了長衫，一面揮汗，一面觀察那房屋四壁所懸測字，批命，撰文的定價和「至親好友，賜敎求現」的標語。張君一向是心細如髮的，爲了避免談話時語言的隔膜起見，把拆字質疑的原由，寫了一個節略，以便一目了然。一直等了個半鐘頭，繼續來請求指迷」的顧客又加了兩個，那預言家纔施施然而來，一面脫長衫，一面打招呼，頻說「失陪失陪！對不起得很」！</p>
<p>照例的「請敎尊姓，府上是……」客套過後，那先生一面揩抹寫字台上的玻璃，從一塊有些像「漢磚」的大硯池中澆着筆，一面把字珠上的字，照樣放大了轉錄在玻璃上面。</p>
<p>是一個「忠」字和一個「羊」字。預言家開始「言歸正傳」了丨丨</p>
<p>「照這兩個字來斷，我肯定你先生的事業，必須從南京一方面進行，纔有希望！因爲「忠」字拆開，「心」字加一撇，是「必」字，合攏來就是「必中」，可是要交七月辛酉的月令，不過半月以後，必有佳音……回安徽是没有希望的。「回」字是兩個「口」字，「忠」添一「口」，就成爲「患」，所以，回鄉進行，恐怕不妥，結果只有望「洋」（羊字加三點水）興歎了！……拆字，只是一點靈機，兄弟大膽說一句，靈不靈只在七月，便見分曉，那時恐怕要叨光一餐喜酒呢……」</p>
<p>「高明之至！費心費心！」</p>
<p>「好說！好說！破費你先生了！」</p>
<p>走出旅館大門之後，我笑着說：「鬼话也要有聰明才會說呢」！</p>
<p>「很有道理，因爲我根本不想回安徽！」</p>
<p>「一顆定心丸，值得兩塊二！」</p>
<p>我們在南京路一家館子裏吃了曉飯，那朋友錢袋裏還有兩枚「孫中山」他竟是餘興不盡，「索性都報効了罷，去找小糊塗」！</p>
<p>小糊塗也不失爲海上的「聞人」之一，所以從廣西路一家煙紙店，就問到他的地方。</p>
<p>我們繞了一個大灣，轉到大慶里。在一個兩樓兩底的住宅的樓下廂房裏，我們覲見了頽頂駝背，年過花甲的小糊塗先生。房屋的四週，滿列着銀牌銀盾和危道豐，屈映光之流所贈的横　對聯之類。張君從棹上一大堆字捲内摸出了「爲」，「短」兩字。說明了來意之後，那位老預言家拿筆就「斷」：</p>
<p>「照字來看，先生的事無論在京在皖，都不能成功！因爲「爲」字上面是有「爪」無「瓜」，就是没有結果，而且下面又是「似馬非馬」，「鳥不能飛」，乃是像有希望，終不能成之兆，而且「短」字的半邊，是「矢」字，「矢」字加「走」，是「迭」字，失敗屢屢之謂！所以，現在只好靜待機會，眼前希望呢，太少！太少！……」</p>
<p>神話說完，孫頭掏出，一塊二毛。</p>
<p>「小糊塗把我越說越糊塗！那幾十個字好像背得爛熟了似的。何以「似馬非馬」？何以「鳥不能飛」？矢字加走爲迭，「迭次失敗」，不會「迭次成功」嗎？呵，「矢」字加走「走」，不是一個字呀！狗屁不通！晤！」那朋友出得門來，像唸咒似的一路唸了回去。</p>
<h3>新生意經</h3>
<p>— 劍仁</p>
<p>近來商業競爭眞是愈出愈奇了。以前，雖然也有「大廉價」之類的競賣，可是一年不過兩三回；也有頗熟閙的點綴與裝璜，却總無今日的豪奢與鬥巧，生存競爭之烈於此可見一般，但在此互相爭消費者的戰鬥中，自然，要生出許多天才，創造者，及「新生意經」的篇幅。</p>
<p>在這一年都是廉價的競賣中，欲爭取顧客誠不是件容易的事。裝璜雖盡奢靡之能事，可只能吸住看熱閙的閑人，要使顧客打開荷包，讓光燦燦的金圓流出，是要另尋法門的。於是，今年的生意經　非有以下各種法寳：設廉價部；買一送一；兩點鐘的廉賣；贈錦　，禮劵，遊藝塲門票，照像館寫眞劵；最後，還有送航空救國彩票頭彩五十萬元，憑運氣照兌……等等。啊啊！眞是說不盡的上海景氣；商人智謀也。</p>
<p>然而，此還不過生意經之平庸者也，還未脫買賣人的氣分。致若一九三三年生意經上别開生面之一頁，吾不能不推某商號之贈「經書」，此誠出一般常人意表之外，而風雅，衛道，適時，賺錢四者皆備者也。這確是一件新發明，是值得商界及商界以外的人士注意的。而某商號之有遠見，又令我們常人，偑服得五體投地。阜寗縣長令董某持誦「孝經」，一時傳爲佳話，今則不能專美於前矣。「經書之珍貴，由此可想見」斑」。有理有理！一贈又是一萬部，眞是老闆慷慨！小子無話可說。</p>
<p>然而，由此我不能不想到，有了陸麻子後，說不定會生出黃麻子來；此一生意經之展開，前途正是非常廣大。不過，法寳雖同是一個，也因玩法不同，手術的高低，會生出不同的結果的。有人愛讀四書，却也有人喜看性史，人的　　　與　相　　不同的，却不相　　的死用。茲將這一經典推而廣之，可贈的「聖書」，「名册」尙有以下的多種。</p>
<p>我想：女子書店，化裝品公司，女子英文補習夜校，女青年會，最好是購貨一元；或加入補習或作會員者送「女兒經」一部，以二萬萬册爲限。</p>
<p>兒童書店，玩具店，可贈「孝經」一部，册數愈多愈好。</p>
<p>旅館，輪船，火車，長途汽車，最宜送「旅行指南」，浴堂，按摩院最宜贈裸體畫一劵；長三堂子，私門頭則以贈新六零六說明書一本或張競生博士性史一册爲宜；跳舞塲，影戲館則以送張資平氏三角戀愛小說一卷爲最有趣，以外，按照「生意」的性質而分贈「聖書」「名册」，均可以此類推，運用無窮。</p>
<p>以外，還可按顧主的年齡，性别，地位而給以更適合其人需要的贈品。譬如老太婆可贈以「玉匣記」一部，老爺可獻「太上感應籍」一篇；少奶奶需要「達生篇」；大公子要讀「致富術」均可按其需要，代爲配合，生意興隆，在下可爲擔保。至若摩登男女，「時代青年」如果他們不要讀「經」，一概可贈以「情書一束」或「二束」，「美容術」一厚册，御妻或御夫術一薄本，包你受者笑嬉嬉，雪花花的洋錢從他或她的皮包内水似的放出來。於是乎，新生意經之「道」遂矣。牠不能推銷了自己的買不出去的貨物，又替古書店做了一椿夢也想不到的買賣。還博得「衛道」「風雅」之美名，許多遺老遺少的感激的眼淚；天下事其有利於此乎？此「新生意經」之揟以值得大提倡而特提倡也。於是乎作「新生意經」。</p>

<h3>上海（三十）</h3>
<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（四十三）上海的天空</p>
<p>陰沉的天氣，烏雲像壓在頭頂似的，使人感到一種說不出話不出的窒息的苦悶。慧姊走了之後，整個下午，我們社中陰沉沉的坐着我馨弟和小黃，對於今天報章登載的無一條件，小黃憤憤不平的說：「這簡直是胡鬧，要是我做了市長，無論如何不答應，我寗願將上海化爲五十年前的荒野墟墳，瞧咱們民衆的力量！」蒲扇大的拳頭老是一伸一伸。</p>
<p>「弱國無外交，不過這一回也有拚一拚的可能……」</p>
<p>一聲像劃破玻璃似的呼聲「號外，號外，」在門外飛過，我們一如專等候着牠似的不約而同的向外飛奔。在這一條平時清靜的咯班路，却東一團西一堆的人羣，每人的臉上劃着疑問的符號。你買了一張號外如其想隨路站定脚跟細瞧，那很快的就會圍上一大堆人來；而且愈圍愈衆。東一圈西一堆的人羣就是這樣聚集攏來的。</p>
<p>小黃買到一張號外丨或者毋寗說是搶，銅元放給賣報孩子的手中，他早飛奔前了。「號外，號外，」那顫動的呼聲在陰沉的空氣中激盪，更使人感覺驚人的恐怕就要到來似的丨我的頭顱剛凑前去，兩位搶不到號外的就圍了上來。</p>
<p>「怎樣？要打嗎？」一個問。</p>
<p>「聴說條件答應了！」那個答，然而說話的口氣也不大信任似的。</p>
<p>「答應了。」小黃想將報紙授給我，却被那個問的人捷足了。</p>
<p>回進社來，旋亮了電燃，兩個人沉默着不說話，當然對於答應了的事件同樣不信任。晚上，笑風和重變都没有歸來，聲弟說他們到閘北接親戚去的。</p>
<p>心中車輪似的盤旋着，轉側不能入睡，夜半時分四周寂寞得和死一樣，似乎隱隱的聽見槍聲。小黃從床上跳起來說一定閘北開火了，忙着起床推了窗子向遠處觀望，對過的窗子中也探着人頭，高高的問一聲聽見什麽没有？</p>
<p>「槍聲！」小黃回答。</p>
<p>說話的時候那聲音又響了起來，一夜騷擾到天明，天空中軋軋的飛機聲證實一切了，外面紛紛鬧着日本人吃敗仗。</p>
<p>「到閘北去」小黃洋洋然笑着，瞧咱們民衆的力量。</p>
<p>我將馨第託付了阿福送到高飛家中去，說我們走了，請高飛到社中來結束。</p>
<p>「我要姐姐家去。」馨弟說。</p>
<p>「好。姐姐今天一定來的，你到舅舅那裏去住着罷。」我們就這樣走了。</p>
<p>表姊到社裏在我們走後的幾分鐘，馨弟告訴她我們說的話，她到我臥室中搜尋了半嚮，見没有什麽字條之類，她獨自靠到窗前流淚。</p>
<p>「姐姐。」馨弟依到慧姊的身旁。</p>
<p>「弟弟……」她撫愛着弟弟的頭髮。</p>
<p>軋軋的飛機聲充滿着上海的天空。</p>

<h3>中國電影藝人訪問記（三十）（續十二月十九日）</h3>
<p>— 沙基</p>
<p>（十三）「風」導演吳村（上）</p>
<p>對於這一位新人物，我想讀者諸君一定是相當覺得生疎的吧？雖然你們很少有機會在他過去的作品上同他認識，但在不久的將來，你們一定可以在他的「風」中，來鑒賞他的藝術作風的。</p>
<p>爲了使讀者諸君易於了解他起見，我先行一般的給你們介紹一下。</p>
<p>他是福建厦門人氏，現年才二十九歲。當十四年中國大騷動的時候，他在厦門某報編緝副刊。這一報紙，在中國革命史上應當有其光榮的地位和歷史，但因爲黑夜的巨浪之打擊，被近停刊。從此，他在血腥中離開了故鄉，開始踏進上海的電影園地。</p>
<p>還在十五歲的學生時代，他便努力於話劇運動。這因爲當時厦門的敎育界和商界，在每年的年假，暑假，都極力維持新劇的公演，繼續二個月之久。所以當時演劇的機會極多，這對於他個人戲劇上的修養，不能不是最值得記憶的時代。</p>
<p>自一九二五年加入電影界以後，自寫塲記以至於助理導演，繼續了六年之久，直至一九三一年，他攝製了他的處女作，題爲「血花淚影」，這是復旦影片公司出品的。今年七月他進了聯華二廠，第二次作品便是這一部「風」了。</p>
<p>以下我便要記錄他的談話了。</p>
<p>冬至後三日的早晨；天氣還是那般温暖，眞是很奇怪的天氣。在延平路旁邊的石子路上走着，右旁的青菜園地，吹來微薄的菜香。久居都市的人們，在這種新鮮的氣氛中，總不免要深深的呼吸幾下的。</p>
<p>快到聯華二廠門口的時候，我趕上了一位穿西裝的青年，他雙手插在大衣口袋裏，每一個脅下，都挾着一個柚子。因爲他和我的朋友戴君頗有相像之處，我很仔細的對他看了幾眼，因爲戴君和我，已是幾年不見面了的原故。後來我到底跑在他的前面，到了二廠門口。我問門房說：</p>
<p>「喂，吳村先生在裏面麽？」　（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「虚榮誤」</h3>
<p>— 逸羣</p>
<p>Walls　of　Gold</p>
<p>丨福斯公司出品，大上海映丨</p>
<p>這是一段家庭醜惡史，它所描寫的是：叔叔搶姪兒的情侶，妹妹奪姊姊的愛人，主旨似乎是暴露金錢的勢力，到底敵不過眞正的愛情，世間惟有能用眞正愛情者，乃能持久，乃能有情人成眷屬，利用金錢來作惡的，結果，終歸要報應昭彰。故事平淡，無甚特異，老調而已。</p>
<p>現在且來談其他。</p>
<p>首先，關於編劇者的中心意識問題；我覺得，劇的主旨，旣是暴露以黃金買愛情之惡果，而提倡眞正愛情，那末，除了描寫金錢勢力的醜惡以外，對於愛情應有明確的指示，方不致顧此失彼，然而可惜得很，在這劇中，我們除了只看到那銅鐵巨商高同，利用其金錢勢力到處作惡以外，並没有看到ＪeanieanieSattelea或Honey　Satterl與BarnesRitchie之間的眞愛情，到底建築在什麽地方。兩姊妹之對於Barnes間的愛，一個個，都似乎很偶然，好像「天作之合」，又好像「一見傾心」。究竟彼此爲什麽會相愛？什麽是彼此間眞正的而并不建築在金錢上面的愛情，表現得非常不夠。而且在Barnes之與HonetJeanie之與銅鐵巨商的結合，都給以一種，因忿而勉强的凑成，這種氣忿主義的結合，是否說得上愛情，不用說，自然是玩笑之至！說到這兒，我憶起這原是美國人的見解，我也就無話可說。</p>
<p>其次，關於導演者的手法，我覺得倒很不差，分幕很乾凈，鏡頭很靈活，幾段小小的滑稽，順手拈來，很自然得體，但可惜對於銅鐵巨商之遭搶殺，處置得太不得當。</p>
<p>至於表演方面，我覺得SallyEilers並不怎樣超特，不過堪稱稱職而已。成功的還是Ralph　Morgen，他表現出社會中有閒而又有錢者之醜惡狀態，一舉一動，都很夠味，大有令人見了他，就會想起自己日常所見所聞的這類典型人物來。</p>
<p>總之，這劇雖不是怎樣成功的作品，但在暴露金錢的醜惡這一點，是差可盡它的任務。</p>
<p>末了，關亽譯名爲「虚榮誤」，實在太不切合了，尤其是Jdanie不譯爲珍妮，而譯爲琴綺，Honey不譯爲紅妮，而譯爲紅綺，也以爲不妥。希望大上海的主持者，加以注意纔好。</p>
<h3>銀幕情人的苦悶</h3>
<p>— 華明</p>
<p>這是一九三三年份中好萊塢影界之中最不幸的消息。好萊塢一對著名的銀幕情人，現在已經彼此分裂而成爲影界中之離恨天中可憐人了。這件事或許能在影界歷史上占據着一頁，而使後來的一般人興不少感念的。</p>
<p>最初在珍妮蓋諾同却爾福雷二人合演「情潮」一片的時候，好萊塢有許多的謠傳，稱却爾福雷同福克斯公司的合同已滿期，待「情潮」一片完成之後，將退休家居，不再爲影界工作，這件消息的產生之後，不久果眞成爲事實，却爾福雷竟同珍妮蓋諾訣别，斷絶上銀幕上的情人關係，這件事故的發生，引起了好萊塢及其他各處對於他們二人，在影界中的地位及歷史所素知的人物都十二分的嘆息。</p>
<p>接着就是希佛萊和琴妮麥唐納二人的不幸事情了。他們二人在好萊塢的影界之中，同却爾福雷和珍妮蓋諾同樣有銀幕情人的稱呼，但是他們二人亦正如却爾福雷珍妮蓋諾般的不幸而訣别了。當希佛萊同琴妮麥唐納二人在影界中最親近的時候，是何等的受人羨慕。但是現在他們亦已經分散了，好萊塢的人亦不再認他們爲銀幕上的情人了。誠然他們同却爾福雷及珍妮蓋諾享受了同樣的幸運榮耀，亦同時有不堪回首之感。</p>
<p>很奇怪的，却爾福雷同珍妮蓋諾二人的離别，却爾福雷同他的夫人仍舊很快樂的渡日，享受家庭之幸福，而珍妮蓋諾却同她的丈夫李杜爾貝克離了婚，而希佛萊同珍妮麥唐納的離别，恰巧相反，珍妮麥唐納同她的丈夫仍舊在法國很安樂，而希佛萊却同他的夫人扶妮范麗離了婚，這兩對銀幕情人的結局恰巧成爲天然的反比例。</p>
<h3>英國影業的新企圖</h3>
<p>— 黃影呆</p>
<p>與好萊塢爭覇天下</p>
<p>范朋克已加入合作</p>
<p>在英國的電影事業上，這眞是一個重要的進展。據最近所得到的消息，倫敦影片公司，已和范朋克，互相結合，組織了一家大規模的影片公司。英國方面，處在領導地位的藝術家，技術家，和好萊塢的美國第一流藝術家，都將設法羅致。這個新的組織，將使普世的人民，改換目光，因爲在最近的三年之中，英國已拆去一重深深的壁壘，漸漸的脫離美國電影業的壓迫，而眼前除了美國出品之外，各國所需要的影片，英國的出品，已高占第一位了。</p>
<p>范朋克的眼光是很遠的。他所着手進行的事，在不久的將來，美國的一般企業家都將羣起而倣效的。范朋克在英國的第一片，將由倫敦影片公司亞力山大高爾泰導演，片名DonJuan。接着將把他成功的默片Zero，重攝聲片。他的兒子，在這張影片中將和他配角。第一片開始拍攝的是CatherineTheGreatofRussia，小范飾年輕的俄皇，伊利莎保保爾格納飾Catherne。</p>
<p>其他新演員的名字雖然並未發表，但一般的人，都相信有五個著名的英國演員，會加入這個組織之中的。他們便是萊斯李好華德，却雨蘭登，黑勃馬賽爾，柯靈克利扶。在可能範圍之内，鮑里斯卡洛夫也許將加入的。將來這個集團，或許將自建攝影場，但現在就在帝國攝影場拍攝影片。</p>
<p>三年之前，英國片在世界上佔不到什麽地位，但現在英國的影片，已和别國的影片同樣的公映於世界各國了。在未來的企圖中，英國的電影企業，已抱了打倒美國，把好萊塢的電影事業，完全奪到英國手裏的决心。</p>
<h3>「飛花村」爲四部戲之第一砲</h3>
<p>— 芻</p>
<p>在明年一月中，藝華公司規定四部戲先後開拍，一部是卜萬蒼導演的「黃金時代」，一部是史東山導演的「女人」，一部是鄭應時導演的「飛花村」，一部是應雲衛導演的「愛的成年」。但是他們昨天一個劇務會議的决定，鄭應時的「飛花村」已排爲第一砲。這個星期内要實行開拍了。</p>
<p>「飛花村」寫一個開火車的阿華和他的美妻在現社會强暴勢力下的一個慘痛的故事，因爲側重暴露，這戲一定熱鬧而剌激的，劇本會議諸人都認爲這種戲頗有價值。</p>
<h3>俱樂部中舉行慶年會</h3>
<p>金燄是個最熱腸的漢子，他雖然在中國影界佔有最高的地位，但是他待人接物都是非常謙恭，對於同人就是一個茶房工匠都是像自己手足般地親切。聯華同人聯歡會上，他曾離開座位給同人們送菜，這雖然不算是一件什麽大不了的事，然而這總該說是他的一種熱誠的表現。</p>
<p>新年將届了，金燄同費穆他們在聯華一廠俱樂部發起了新年大慶祝，預備着新年大家歡聚一下。費穆供給多種食品，金燄供給酒一大箱，廠長黎民偉和梁伯慈邢少梅等均有物品的供用。現在，其他同人也都踴躍參加了一般預料，新年一定夠熱鬧的吧。</p>
<h3>兩江女校羣星亂飛</h3>
<p>聯華二廠導演孫瑜繼「小玩意」作再進一步努力的「體育皇后」，十九日借兩江體育師範學校拍學校外景，因天氣不佳没有一點收穫，但是第二天就陽光照耀而一切進行都非常如意了。參加拍戲的女星有黎莉莉，王默秋，王掞，和新進的白鷺，客串的殷虚，男星有張翼，尙冠武，韓蘭根，殷秀岑，李君磬等。這般電影明星在兩江和她們的髈能明星混在一起馳騁於運動塲上，便眞的有點像羣星亂飛令人看了眼花繚亂呢。這天，整天的拍了幾十個鏡頭，祇完成學校生活那塲戲的一半，所以第三天又去拍了整天纔把這塲戲拍完了。</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>青春之火（二）</h3>
<p>— 侯楓</p>
<p>「青春之火」在胡師長的公館裏，燃燒着。大雄的秘書張季森，早就對着愛蓮垂涎三丈了。可是愛蓮的心目中，早已有了何孟先。因此，她對於張季森，祇有感到厭惡。</p>
<p>這是一個晚上，孟先已穿上睡衣，預備要睡的時候，愛蓮潛至他的房中，看見上面寫着「孟先吻存」的一張徐蘭芬的半身像，使她感到無限的悲哀。她竟把那照片取下來，把個「吻」字揩掉了。大雄回到家裏來，在孟先的房子裏面，看見愛蓮對孟先那麽親暱的樣子，不禁妒火中燒，愛蓮却先發制人，拿着蘭芬的照片，笑着走過去，對大雄說：</p>
<p>「你看，我們將來的表弟婦多麽漂亮啊！」使得大雄又是啞口無言。</p>
<p>大雄離家赴省謝委了。愛蓮更百般地鈎引孟先。又是一個晚上：愛蓮把孟先呌到自己的房裏來，說是替她寫一封信給師長。這時的孟先，雖然自知使君有婦，然而他不是柳下惠，對於這深重的誘惑，怎能不爲所動呢？因此，在這種自然法則的發展下，孟先是漸漸地在愛蓮的厚待底下，和蘭芬漸形疎遠了。一日，蘭芬上胡公館來找孟先生，眼見得孟先和愛蓮對坐着用早餐，而愛蓮却使其丫頭瞞着孟先，回絶蘭芬，說是「何先生不在家」呢！</p>
<p>這青春之火正在日趨嚴重。張季森極力地設法離間孟先和愛蓮的關係，而使之就蘭芬。到徐家去看蘭芬，被蘭芬嚴詞讉責了一番，後來她姐姐蕙芬給他說明，並且要他搬出胡公館，離開愛蓮。於是他在兩種情感的衝擊間，他是答應了蕙芬的要求，——搬出胡公館，給蘭芬一個事實上的解釋。但是等到孟先回到胡公館，要想搬出的時候，愛蓮却不答應。她說：「你這樣急急地搬走，師長回來，呌我怎麽對他說？他一定要怪我得罪了你，或者，他竟會疑心到我同你……這呌我怎麽做人呢？後來孟先决計搬出胡公館了。他還直了回絶愛蓮的一封信。但那封信却被張季森用計取去。在這愛的圈裏，造成了變動後的一個舊局面。（未完）</p>

However, the Central Army is facing them with twice their strength, and the army, navy, and air force are acting simultaneously to use more against less and strength against weakness. Currently, the deployments of the army and navy on all fronts have been arranged. (28th dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) At the closing of the Central Standing Committee meeting on the 28th, Zhang Ji reported on the progress of the southern trip, which lasted a long time. The original words of his report are recorded as follows: This member and members Ma Chaojun, Chen Zhaoying, and Wang Luyi were entrusted by the Central Standing Committee on the 7th of this month to go south to liaise with central comrades in the south and exchange views on unity and national salvation. We departed from Shanghai on the 9th, arrived in Hong Kong on the 11th, and met with Committee Member Hu Hanmin. At the same time, Committee Member Lin Yizhong and Committee Member Liu Jiwen came from Guangzhou and were also met with. On the 13th, we arrived in Guangzhou and visited Xiao Focheng, Deng Zheru, Chen Jitang, Lin Yungai, Zou Lu, and other committee members in the province. We then explained the intentions of the Central Government in detail, and the comrades also inquired about the situation of the Central Party and Government. On the 15th, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Huang Xuchu and other committee members of Guangxi replied by telegram, inviting us to make a trip to Nanning, so we set off and went via Wuzhou, arriving on the 17th and meeting with Committee Members Li, Bai, and Huang to exchange views on the current situation. On the 19th, we left Nanning and returned to Guangzhou on the 21st, discussing in detail with various committee members again. On the 22nd, we met with Committee Member Hu Hanmin again in Hong Kong, totaling four discussions. We also met with Committee Member Wu Chaochu and Committee Member Tang Shaoyi in Hong Kong. At that time, Committee Member Sun Ke passed through Hong Kong on his way south and we had a brief discussion. That evening, we set off and returned to Nanjing, arriving on the 26th. This is the situation of our southern trip. The main points of contact are roughly as follows: (1) The opinions of various central comrades in the south are detailed in the various meetings. In summary, the comrades believe that the country is experiencing many misfortunes, and that domestic and foreign affairs and bandit suppression all need to be rectified and promoted. Currently, the rebellion in Fujian is also occurring, and the country faces the fear of disintegration. The comrades' intentions are sincere, and even if there is blame, they have not forgotten to make suggestions. What is different is appropriate to complement each other, and those who blame are loving each other. The Central Government originally wanted to listen to and accept all opinions and seek to supplement national affairs, so the blame and encouragement from the comrades in the south can be regarded as a sincere warning. (2) Regarding the brewing of a government in the southwest, opinions from all parties were collected. The southwest has already declared its firm opposition to the Fujian rebellion. On the one hand, it argues in detail that the Central Party and Government measures should be reformed to seek progress, but it still resolutely avoids any actions that could divide the entire party and government. The fact that Guangdong and Guangxi show no opposition to the Central Government indicates that the situation in Guangdong and Guangxi is completely different from that in 1931 and is actually better than before. (3) The comrades in the south have a very clear understanding of the Fujian rebellion, and their position is also very clear. They believe that the rebellion is actually colluding with the communist bandits and will bring an irreparable crisis to the country, and it should be strongly opposed. As for how the Central Government should severely sanction it, the Southwest has expressed its approval and is willing to quickly correct it. (4) Regarding the attendance of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee by the members in the Southwest, Zou Lu told us on the 14th that the result of the contact with Hu Hanmin was that the members in the Southwest should send those who are not bound by duties to attend at that time. This was before receiving the notice of the rescheduling of the plenary session. Now that the time is more relaxed, the members in the Southwest who can come to Beijing when the Central Government holds a meeting will definitely be able to come to Beijing to attend. (5) During our journey, we observed that the government and people in Guangxi are able to work hard to build from difficulties and hardships, which is much progress than before. Now the transportation has reached considerable convenience, and because the civil defense corps are handled very widely, the local order is very stable, and the people have been able to live and work in peace. There has been an achievement in its psychological construction before this was achieved. The advantage is that the government can support the people's strength and develop the people's organization and training, so that the government measures at this time can achieve twice the result with half the effort. In Guangdong, the local situation has become peaceful, and many people have moved from the metropolis to the countryside, and industry and commerce have also made progress. The cement, silk, linen, sugar, and sulfuric acid factories run by the government have been very successful in their operation and planning. We believe that the comrades of the Central Government can work hard separately in various places, which is to work hard for the Central Government. (6) Regarding the construction funds for National Sun Yat-sen University, and the strengthening of the Central Executive Committee's connection with the Southwest, and the exchange of party certificates for party members in the Southwest, we will submit details separately to the Standing Committee. In short, we have respectfully upheld the will of the Central Government this time, and the mission has been largely achieved. Other details have been briefly mentioned in the conversations during the journey and will not be repeated. After Committee Member Zhang Ji's report, Committee Member Chen Zhaoying made a supplementary report, which was very detailed. (28th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Chaojun returned to Beijing on the morning of the 28th and said that during this southern trip, he met with comrades in Hong Kong, Guangdong, and Guangxi to discuss all major plans for the party, the country, and domestic and foreign affairs, and the results were very satisfactory. Hu Hanmin, Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and Bai Chongxi have a great understanding of the Central Government and are extremely indignant about Fujian Province. However, it is uncertain whether Hu can come north. The rest of the Central Committee members in the Southwest, except for those who cannot leave in fact, can probably come to Beijing to attend the Fourth Plenary Session. As for Sun Ke's southern trip, he accompanied his wife, Chen Shuying, on a sea trip. When he passed through Hong Kong, he could not help but visit his old friend Hu Hanmin in a private capacity. Sun will return to the north at the beginning of next month. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain Central Committee member said that there is no precedent for holding a preparatory meeting before the opening of the plenary session. Last time, the Southwest side requested that a preparatory meeting be held in Shanghai before the Fourth Plenary Session to exchange opinions, but this proposal has now been dismissed. However, a preparatory meeting may be held at the opening of the official meeting to exchange opinions on the proposals of the various committees and to elect secretaries and other staff, as well as various important cases in the conference, so that there is room for harmony. After the four members Zhang, Wang, Chen, and Ma went south to explain, most of the Central Committee members in the Southwest are expected to attend. However, it is reported that the Southwest members will submit proposals to the conference based on Hu's declaration, and it is expected that there will not be excessive conflicts with the Central Government's propositions. (28th dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Chaojun arrived in Beijing at 7:00 AM on the 28th. According to the talk, during this southern trip, he issued a written statement in Shanghai, which will not be repeated. The construction of Guangxi Province has shown a rapid progress. The civil servants are quite hardworking, their clothes are simple, and they are no different from ordinary people. The schools are well-run, the local defense corps have achieved remarkable results, the social order is very good, and the roads are accessible, making transportation convenient. If they continue to work hard, the results will be even more impressive. (28th Central News Agency dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Renewed Tension in the Arms Race (Cautious)</h3>
<p>Switzerland is a sacred haven of peace in Europe and a model for democratic countries worldwide. Recently, due to the deepening global economic crisis, even this renowned "world park," Switzerland, has lost its former prosperity. Those who once flocked to its picturesque landscapes for leisurely pursuits have also seen their interest wane with the economic downturn. Unexpectedly, today, this universally recognized paradise is known for expanding its military. Since the arms reduction conference broke down, Germany withdrew from the League of Nations, and Italy expressed dissent, European countries have felt increasingly uneasy. Nations directly in the line of fire, such as Germany, France, and even smaller countries like China, have all been striving to expand their military and actively promote the military-industrial complex to stimulate the general economic climate and overcome the current difficulties. Even Switzerland, with an area of only 41,000 square kilometers and a population of only 4.1 million, with a standing army of only 25,000, is now, in light of the tense European situation and fearing a renewed conflict between Germany and France, sparing no expense in allocating 80 million Swiss francs to enhance its military. Its military tanks, infantry artillery, and light and heavy machine guns have all been increased. People who have served in the military and received training are also undergoing advanced retraining. From Switzerland, we can gauge the current state of Europe and the degree of urgency.</p>
<p>Since the early days of human society, competition has been more prevalent than peaceful movements. After the formation of national organizations, competition between individuals transformed into antagonism between countries or ethnic groups. The advancement of human society's economy, politics, and culture has largely depended on the continued development in this contradictory state of competition and opposition. After the end of World War I in 1918, all countries, suffering heavy losses, desired rest. Therefore, the call for peace began to be generally accepted worldwide. However, now that advanced countries have developed extreme manufacturing capabilities, domestic consumer markets cannot accommodate the surplus goods. Overseas colonies and markets in underdeveloped countries are shrinking due to competitive dumping. The smaller the market, the fiercer the competition. To maintain old markets, open up new markets, and divide markets with undefined boundaries, powerful countries are all using force as a backing. Overall, the situation is quite similar to the so-called "armed peace" before 1914.</p>
<p>With the rise of military competition, the Army Disarmament Conference inevitably came to a standstill, or even failure. The irreconcilable economic interests of the major powers, France's security guarantees, Germany's military equality, Italy's reform of the League of Nations, and England's traditional diplomacy all clashed with each other. It is very clear that army disarmament cannot find a suitable solution. What about the navy? Currently, only five countries—England, America, Japan, France, and Italy—have the financial resources to expand their navies and a naval power base. Among these five countries, England, America, and Japan have stronger naval forces, making naval agreements seemingly easier to reach. However, the center of the maritime competition for supremacy is in the Pacific Ocean, which falls within the competitive scope of England, America, and Japan. Each wants to maintain its absolute military advantage. The Washington Treaty will expire two years from now. What will the 1935 naval conference be like? Will the naval warship ratio lead to an increase in armaments due to inequality, or will it trigger an armed conflict? We will set aside such a pessimistic outlook for now. Let's analyze the current situation. Assuming that the Second Washington Conference can be convened and that England, America, and Japan can consider the needs of peace and express that all issues are open for discussion, there will still be at least the following difficulties. First, the leadership issue. England and America dominated the previous Washington Conference. In the future, Japan will strive with all its might to seize the hegemony of the Far East. Second, the ship type issue. England has naval ports in colonies all over the world where it can refuel, so it advocates for small ships. Japan's islands are adjacent, and its offensive and defensive targets are not far away, so it can also agree to small ships. America is different. The Atlantic and Pacific Oceans are too far apart, and the Philippines are even 6,000 nautical miles away. Even if it adopts an extremely defensive posture, it needs larger ships to be able to apply them. This argument is difficult to concede. Third, the tonnage of submarines and the limitations of aircraft carriers are also based on different opinions, with no possibility of cooperation. With such a situation in the army and navy competition, can there be hope for world peace?</p>
<h3>Demand for Re-armament</h3>
<p>France drafts a reply to Germany, rejecting direct negotiations outside the scope of the League of Nations. France and Belgium reach complete understanding.</p>
<p>Germany agrees to compromise on expanding its standing army.</p>
<p>But must sign non-aggression pacts with its neighbors as a condition.</p>
<p>The trial period for supervision is reduced from four years to two years.</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government's memorandum in response to the German government's demand for military equipment was drafted today at a cabinet meeting and will be delivered to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs by Ambassador Ponsot to Germany within a few days. It is reported that the content indicates that France is willing to continue exchanging opinions through ordinary diplomatic channels, but disarmament negotiations must be conducted in Geneva within the scope of the League of Nations, so that all relevant countries can participate. According to reports, French Prime Minister Doumergue met with the ministers of foreign affairs, army, navy, and air force yesterday to discuss this matter. The cabinet today finalized the results of yesterday's discussion. According to well-informed sources, France is now willing to compromise on the German demand to expand its standing army by 100,000 and its militia by 300,000, agreeing to increase it to 200,000, but on the condition that Germany sign non-aggression treaties with its neighbors. It is also willing to shorten the four-year trial period for monitoring disarmament by two years. It is reported that France's attitude in this memorandum is in accordance with the methods agreed upon in the previous talks between British and French diplomatic authorities. At that time, both parties strictly stipulated that all disarmament discussions must be held within the League of Nations. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<h3>British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, Meets with Simon</h3>
<p>Reports Mussolini's opinions</p>
<p>(London) Today, the British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, went to Capri to arrange a meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Foreign Secretary Simon in the future. Drummond traveled by car from Rome to Naples today and took an Italian torpedo boat to the island of Capri. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Rome British Ambassador to Italy Sir Drummond's meeting with British Foreign Secretary Simon in Capri is intended to report to Simon Italy's views on reforming the League of Nations and disarmament issues. Regarding the first point, the Roman government is expressing the reactions of several countries. Foreign Vice Minister Suvich's trip to Berlin recently revealed that even if the League of Nations is reorganized, it will not be enough to induce Germany to participate in Geneva again. On the other hand, France clearly advocates reorganizing the League of Nations and consolidating its strength, and the United Kingdom has also expressed its support. In view of this, the Roman government may no longer overthrow the current organization of the League of Nations and reorganize it from scratch. Regarding the issue of armaments, it is known here that the United Kingdom supports Germany's partial rearmament and believes that France can also acknowledge it. What we should pay attention to is that the number of troops demanded by Germany is 300,000, while the UK's disarmament plan stipulates only 200,000. In summary, Simon and Mussolini may seek a compromise basis that is roughly close to British opinion, allowing Germany to rearm to a small extent on the one hand, and requiring France to partially disarm on the other, in order to seek mutual rapprochement between Paris and Berlin.

<h3>French Ambassador to Germany Summoned Home</h3>
<p>(Paris) French Ambassador to Germany Ponsot arrived in Paris at 11:00 this morning. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Yesterday, the ministers of the army, navy, and air force held a meeting to discuss Franco-German relations, especially the issue of Germany's request to rearm. The Council of State continued to discuss this matter today. After the ministers of the army, navy, and air force presented their opinions, the Council of State decided to send new instructions to French Ambassador to Germany Ponsot, which may be delivered tomorrow or Friday. After the meeting, reporters asked Prime Minister Doumergue for his opinion. Doumergue replied, "As a rule, diplomatic documents cannot be published before they are sent to foreign countries, and the government should strictly maintain secrecy. I hope you can understand that what I can say is only the following: negotiations with various countries are the methods determined by the presidium of the Disarmament Conference. France is willing to negotiate with any relevant country. However, France ultimately believes that disarmament should be carried out within the scope of the League of Nations in order to seek general security. France has put forward various concrete suggestions in this regard, and its attitude has always been the same. Everyone must be able to understand its sincere desire for peace." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>France and Germany Still Disagree on Military Security</h3>
<p>(London) The Paris correspondent of The Times exclusively stated that the French government's attitude does not imply that continued talks in any form are impossible after exchanging opinions with Germany without any results, nor does it imply that the French government opposes direct Franco-German talks in principle. However, because France and Germany differ too much in their views on military security and the League of Nations, it is believed that negotiations should still be conducted through ordinary diplomatic channels. This will indeed make it difficult to make any progress before the meeting of the Executive Council of the League of Nations in mid-January next year, and it will force the meeting of the Main Committee of the Disarmament Conference to continue to be postponed. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<h3>France's Answer is Tantamount to Shifting Responsibility for the Breakup</h3>
<p>(London) The British newspapers deeply regretted the French cabinet's rejection of Germany's proposal on disarmament, saying that France's answer was equal to France shifting the responsibility for the breakup of the talks. The Morning Post stated that France is currently unable to solve any diplomatic or political problems. The only hope now lies in the talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Foreign Secretary Simon, which can provide a new impetus for discussions between Germany and France. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<h3>Franco-Belgian Talks Involve Both Politics and Economy</h3>
<p>(Paris) France's attitude towards disarmament and the future of the League of Nations has continued to gain support. Today it was heard that French Foreign Minister Poncet and Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans had reached a complete understanding on the two points that Germany must not rearm and the League of Nations must not be fundamentally reorganized. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The issues discussed by Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans and the French authorities are roughly divided into two types: one is political issues and the other is economic issues. France and Belgium have close relations and common interests, and there will be no differences of opinion during the consultations. Regarding diplomatic issues, both countries regard Germany's military expansion as a danger and do not ignore it. Hymans will probably discuss national defense issues with the Army Chief. Regarding the League of Nations, both France and Belgium believe that the rights of small countries cannot be harmed by anyone. Regarding economic issues, Hymans will explain the following views to Minister of Commerce Laurent-Eynac: since the economic organizations of France and Belgium are the same and both strictly adhere to the gold standard, the two countries should mutually combine on monetary issues to express their economic interdependence. In addition, the issue of France's import restrictions is also on the agenda. Finally, Hymans will discuss issues related to workers on the border between the two countries with former Budget Minister Lamoureux. In other words, the issue of Belgian workers working in France and French workers working in Belgium. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Greek Foreign Minister Runs for Peace in the Balkans</h3>
<p>(Paris) Greek Foreign Minister Maximos plans to travel to Rome from abroad on January 2 next year for a short stay, and then go directly to London, and then return to Paris from London. This morning, Mr. Maximos made a statement to our reporter, saying, "We have achieved a very important result in building peace in the Balkan Peninsula, namely the Treaty of Friendship signed between Greece and Turkey. Greece and Turkey are now closely cooperating to achieve this great cause. In the spirit of Balkan peace, I will go to Zagreb, Yugoslavia, to meet with King Alexander of Yugoslavia. When I met with Foreign Minister Poncet yesterday, Poncet deeply agreed with this policy, saying that it was in line with France's efforts for Europe. I will visit the British and Italian authorities in the near future. I know that the governments of the two countries will definitely express their approval of our efforts for peace." (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>German Newspaper Ridicules the League of Nations for Incompetence</h3>
<p>(London) According to news from Berlin, the organ newspaper of the National Socialist Party stated that the League of Nations itself has proven to be a failure. In general, the League of Nations has no result-oriented ability and is not in line with the trend. It also stated that the belief in international conferences was created by the effect of the Lausanne Conference in 1932 and has been destroyed by subsequent conferences. Since the failure of the London Economic Conference, there has been no hope of international solutions in the near future. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Ambassador to France Sato Presents Credentials</h3>
<p>(Paris) President Lebrun officially received Sato, the new Japanese ambassador to France, at 11 o'clock this morning and held a ceremony for presenting his credentials. Foreign Minister Poncet and civil and military officials from the presidential palace were in attendance. After the ceremony, Sato gave a speech, first saying that the friendly relations between France and Japan have lasted for a long time. Recently, France and Japan have been able to work together to seek the general happiness of mankind in all aspects. The Japanese ambassador then briefly outlined his past experience, saying that he was fortunate to be able to return to this capital with valuable friendships in Paris in the past, and he dared to assure the President that his purpose in serving here was to consolidate and develop the existing good relations between the two countries, and to further enhance this good relationship to the greatest extent possible, and to do his best to consolidate world peace. President Lebrun replied, first praising the achievements of the previous Japanese ambassador to France, and then saying that he was very pleased to see His Excellency return to this country, because his country has always been highly respectful of His Excellency. His Excellency came to his country the other day and worked hard for peace and international cooperation. His ambition, courage, and perseverance will never be forgotten by the people of his country. Now that His Excellency has returned to this land, he will be able to make France and Japan more united, and will receive the most sincere support from his government. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>British Overseas Trade Department Strongly Advocates Sino-British Cooperation</h3>
<p>Seeking to promote British goods in the Chinese market</p>
<p>British newspapers praise our fulfillment of obligations</p>
<p>(London) The Overseas Trade Department today released a report on trade conditions from 1931 to 1933, strongly advocating that Chinese and British merchants cooperate in China to develop manufacturing, saying that if sufficient security can be obtained and a larger market for British goods is to be opened up in China, there is a fundamental principle that must be recognized, namely, that cooperation with Chinese merchants is necessary. The success of Japanese manufacturing may be matched by China in the future, which is very achievable. China's domestic cotton production is increasing day by day. Last year's imports of cotton goods were only 42 percent of the total in 1929. Therefore, it is expected that the imported goods will become less and less hot goods and more and more machinery and equipment. The United Kingdom can make up for its losses in cooked goods with machinery and other items.

<h3>India's Increased Tariffs Cause Great Panic Among Japanese Merchants</h3>
<p>Requesting government to fight for it</p>
<p>(Tokyo) All Japanese people are actively opposing India's new tariff system, believing that it has the nature of prohibiting the import of foreign goods. The government has received petitions from all parties requesting that the New Delhi meeting not continue. The government has also expressed great surprise at this matter, as the new tariffs also apply to goods that have already been shipped. Today, the Kobe Chamber of Commerce passed a resolution requesting the government to recall the Japanese representative in New Delhi and stop the progress of the Japanese-Indian meeting. The textile industry also petitioned the authorities to suspend the Japanese-Indian negotiations. It is said that unless the Indian side agrees not to increase tariffs on various goods, they can recognize the conditions of the Japanese concessions in the New Delhi meeting. At the same time, merchants in Kobe and Osaka have sent examples of the new Indian tax regulations to the government. According to reports, the new tax regulations increase the tax on tea sets by 550 percent, and the tax regulations for woven fabrics increase by 50 to 230 percent.

One investigator even said that there were only 1,000 steel trains. It is expected that when Congress reconvenes in the future, it will discuss the issue of forcing railway companies to switch to steel trains. (Reuters, 27th)</p>

<h3>Closing of the Asian Student Congress</h3>

<p>Rome: The Asian Student Congress, held here, has now concluded. The University of Rome hosted a reception where representatives from various countries delivered speeches expressing their gratitude for the warm hospitality. The chairman of the Congress announced the intention to establish a "Permanent International Association of Students from the Near East, Middle East, and Far East." The Asian students were then received by the Undersecretary of the Italian Ministry of Corporations, Mr. Lusano, who gave a speech on the current state of the Italian corporatist system, stating that the "super-capitalism" adopted by Italy is a form of internationalism. He further stated, "It is not true culture to regulate the relationship between humans and machines. Only by regulating the relationship between humans with wisdom and justice can we call it true culture. Fascists are revolutionaries, and industrialists cannot consider themselves conservatives, because industrialists must use machines, and machines have a revolutionary nature. If industrialists are conservative, they will inevitably conflict with the machines they use. Those who destroy property are not revolutionaries. What we should abolish is ignorance and poverty." In conclusion, addressing the Asian students specifically, he said, "You are young and promising, and the responsibility for creating a new history for humanity rests on you. But since you bear the responsibility of creating history, you must first know what you desire is achievable. As for what we Italians desire, it is to work with the people of all countries with good intentions, friendship, and harmony to create a more just and humane social order." (Havas Dispatch, 28th)</p>
<h3>US Actively Expanding Navy</h3>
<p>Navy Department to Submit Proposal to Congress</p>
<p>To Seize Hegemony in the Pacific Ocean</p>
<p>(Washington) The US Navy Department disclosed today that it will request the next Congress to (1) authorize the President to maintain the Navy to the limits permitted by the treaties, and to replace warships that are too old when necessary; (2) In addition, it will also request a new shipbuilding fund of 100 million yuan in the 1934 naval budget to build two large destroyers, twelve light destroyers, six submarines, and to fund the construction expenses required for one battlecruiser and two light cruisers approved by the previous Congress; (3) It also intends to request Congress to increase the number of naval personnel from 79,500 to 82,500 next year. According to the US Navy's plan, it now intends to build 102 new ships at a cost of 560 million yuan by 1939, so that the US Navy can be equal to the British Navy, and in terms of quantity, exceed Japan according to the 5:5:3 ratio of the London Treaty. Building 32 ships using public works funds this year and 5 ships using the Navy's regular expenses is the first step in its shipbuilding program, and building 20 ships next year is the second step. According to people in the Navy Department, the shipbuilding program at this time will first pay attention to destroyers, submarines, and aircraft carriers, because they are the most urgently needed at present. If Congress can pass this proposal, the number of new ships built by the United States each year can be reduced to 13 in 1953. According to people in the Navy Department, the United States must now build one aircraft carrier, one heavy cruiser, five light cruisers, sixty-five destroyers, and thirty submarines to reach the strength permitted by the Washington Naval Treaty. Conversely, Japan has already built the full amount, and the United Kingdom is only 61 ships short of the strength permitted by the treaty. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>

<h3>Roosevelt Hosts Banquet for Philippine Independence Delegation</h3>
<p>Instructs Quezon to Prepare a Memorandum</p>
<p>Willing to Give Careful Consideration</p>
<p>(Washington) A White House spokesman announced today that President Roosevelt has ordered Philippine Senate President Quezon to submit a concrete proposal for resolving the Philippine independence issue.

However, the President does not bear any other responsibility other than guaranteeing that the submitted proposal will be given careful consideration. According to members of the independence delegation, Quezon is currently preparing a memorandum within one week. His proposal generally requests that the United States allow the Philippines to be independent in the near future based on economic conditions that are more favorable to the Filipinos than the original Philippine Independence Act. During yesterday's banquet, Quezon took the opportunity to present to the President that the sugar agreement rejected by Agriculture Secretary Wallace some time ago would greatly help the Philippines' finances, and requested that the President visit Manila after touring Puerto Rico and Hawaii in the future.

<h3>US Mint Receives Silver to Mint Coins</h3>
<p>Canadian Mining Resurrects Vitality</p>
<p>(Washington) The US National Government Mint announced today that it is ready to receive silver and mint silver coins in accordance with the proclamation issued by the President. (National Telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>Ottawa: Canadian silver mines produced 26 million ounces of silver in 1930. However, due to the sluggish silver price, production gradually decreased, and only 18 million ounces were produced in 1932. Now that US President Roosevelt has a policy of raising the silver price, and Canada also has the hope of ratifying the London Silver Agreement during this session of Congress, it is expected that Canadian silver mines will resume their activities. There are already important arrangements for preparing to mine silver on the east coast of Great Slave Lake. London financiers believe that President Roosevelt's silver policy will create a surplus of silver production, unless another method is found. The way to remedy this seems to be to implement the bimetallic system advocated by American silver-producing countries, or to restore the pre-war fineness of European silver coins.

President Roosevelt convened his advisors today to prepare the budget, and at the same time, the Ministry of Commerce reported that the foreign trade surplus in November was 56 million yuan. Cumming, the General Manager of the Deposit Insurance Corporation, stated today that the temporary guarantee fund that will begin next week can fully guarantee 97% of bank deposits, and the amount of insurance is limited to a maximum of 2,500 yuan per household.

<h3>Li Yangjing Inspects the Border Between Guangdong, Fujian, and Jiangxi</h3>
<p>Li is Responsible for the Defense of the Fujian-Jiangxi Border</p>
<p>Huge Defensive Works Have Been Completed</p>
<p>Shantou correspondence: Li Yangjing, the commander of the 3rd Army of Guangdong, toured the East River this month. On the 4th, he convened a military conference at the Meixian military headquarters. Huang Renhuan, commander of the Independent 1st Division, Huang Yanzhen of the 7th Division, Huang Zhiwen of the 8th Division, Ouyang Xin, chief of staff of the 3rd Army, Yang Youmin, chief of staff of the Eastern District Command, Li Hua, director of the Highway Department, and Lu Zuoxin, director of the station, were all present. After the meeting, Li and Huang Renhuan went to Jiaoling to inspect the trenches along the Wuping border area. On the 11th, he and Ouyang Xin went from Jiaoling to Pingyuan. On the 13th, he arrived at Liuche, at the junction of Xunping, and immediately entered Xunwu, Chengjiang, and Jitan in Jiangxi to inspect the front line. In Xunwu City, he summoned the troops of the 8th Division to give a speech, roughly stating that the People's Government is now organizing in Fujian, and the Communist bandits in the border area between Fujian and Jiangxi are taking the opportunity to operate. The Red disaster has a tendency to rise again. Our army is responsible for the defense of Eastern Guangdong and should be on strict alert to maintain security. The current border deployment has been consolidated and there is no other danger in the area. The people in various sectors have been helping the government build roads and dig trenches, which is admirable. There is no need to suspect anything else. Our army vows to do its best to protect the territory and keep the people safe, so that all sectors can live and work in peace and the financial situation will not be adversely affected. On the 16th, Li returned to the Meixian military headquarters by car. The commanders of the 7th and 8th divisions went to Xingning to inspect the defenses. Xingning is currently guarded by Li Zhenliang's division. The two division commanders also went to Fengshun from Xingning to inspect the city defenses, because the city's huge defensive works have been completed and are used for the storage of firearms, ammunition, and food. There are four new trenches outside the city. On the 17th, Li inspected Dabu and the Chaozhou area via the Mei-Song road. He is expected to arrive in Shantou in about a day. Currently, Zhang Ruigui's division is responsible for the Chaozhou area, and Li is responsible for the Fujian-Jiangxi border. Li's visit to Shantou is to inspect the affairs of the Eastern District Pacification Commissioner's Office. The local areas of the counties on the Fujian border are becoming increasingly chaotic, and many people are fleeing into Guangdong territory. (22nd)</p>
<h3>Hubei Army Encirclement and Suppression of Bandit Gangs in Southern Hubei</h3>
<p>—Navy and Air Force Mobilized in Concert—</p>
<p>Wuchang Correspondence: The counties of Tongcheng, Chongyang, Tongshan, Yangxin, and Xianning in Southern Hubei have been plunged into a state of terror since the bandits from Jiangxi invaded. The bandits are the false 16th and 17th Armies, and have begun to take active action since the 20th. The false 17th Army is attacking Jinniu Town in Echeng County, and the false 16th Army is advancing towards Yangludong near Puchi in the south. The false 3rd and 7th Divisions are occupying Datian Mountain in Echeng and Yangxin, using it as a lair. Jinniu Town is only 120 miles from Wuchang and is an important location in southern Hubei. Yangludong also controls the hub of the Xiang-E Road. The authorities attach great importance to these two locations and have sent reinforcements, who will join forces to launch a major suppression campaign immediately. Zeng Yiding, commander of the Second Fleet, also boarded a warship from Hankou and went west along the Yangtze River to consolidate the river defenses. The task of protecting the Xiang-E Road, north of Puchi, is undertaken by Feng Xingxian's troops, and south of Linxiang, it is undertaken by Li Jue's division of the Hunan Army. There are also the 6th Railway Artillery Team and armored vehicles patrolling back and forth, which should be sufficient to ensure safety. According to foreign estimates, the bandits currently have no intention of attacking Wuhan. Their targets are no more than the following two routes: (1) Break through the Yangtze River bank and go to Xindi or Luoshan to enter Honghu; (2) Cross the river from Bailuoji and drive straight into Wufeng and Hefeng in Western Hubei, and join forces with the He bandits. However, the national army has a tight defense and their attempts will definitely be difficult to realize. (27th)</p>
<h3>Red Bandits in the Border Area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Provinces Almost Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>Bandit Leader Wu Huanxian's Whereabouts Unknown</p>
<p>Thorough Follow-Up is Urgently Needed</p>
<p>Kaifeng correspondence: The red bandits in the border area of Henan, Hubei, and Anhui provinces were completely defeated by the national army in October. The remnants initially fled from Huang'an and Jingfu to the east, then to Shangcheng and Lihuang. Then, some of them returned to harass Huang'an and Jingfu. The commander was Wu Huanxian, commander of the false 25th Army (Wu is from Zhengjiabian in Jingfu, with 3,000 shi of rice at home, a graduate of the Wuhan Military and Political School, and the leader of the Huang'an faction among the false red bandits). Some retreated to poor valleys, relying on their location for self-preservation. A month ago, taking advantage of the troop deployments, the Communist bandits suddenly occupied Huangbeizhan, which belonged to Huang'an County, and were soon defeated. They fled north to the Dai Shiying and Zheng Bi Gao area. On the 10th of this month, they suddenly arrived at Daijia Village, a few miles from Jingfu City. The security squadron stationed there was completely sacrificed due to the disparity in numbers. The whereabouts of the captain Xu is unknown, and the two platoon leaders were abducted by the bandits. Liang Guanying, the commander-in-chief of the 25th Route Army, upon hearing the alarm, flew in reinforcements and captured a large number of people and guns. The bandits then retreated to Pengjia Dawang, 30 miles southeast of Jingfu, and held the dangerous pass to the death. After another four or five days of fierce fighting, they looted the cotton clothes and food of the refugees along Baishi'an and retreated to Yangsizhai. After another fierce attack, they collapsed in all directions. Wu's bandits' whereabouts are unknown. The bandit suppression headquarters in the border area is now offering a reward for his arrest. In Lihuang, which was originally the defense area of the 12th Division, the division was ordered to relocate on the 4th of this month, and the Zheng Regiment of Liang Guanying's troops took over. The red bandits hiding in the deep mountains then crept to the river bank two miles from the city and attacked the city with gunfire, creating an extremely critical situation. Fortunately, the Zheng Regiment calmly came out of the city to fight back, and the 54th Division of Hao Mengling's troops and the 64th Division of Wu Tinglin's Brigade flew to their aid and attacked the bandits' rear. On the 18th, they occupied Xuanjianshan and Daijiahe, and the bandits fled towards the Shi River. The leader of this group was Zhang, the chairman of the false Southeast Henan Soviet, who gathered 1,000 remnants of the false 82nd and 84th Divisions. After being severely wounded, the losses were almost complete. Currently, the indigenous bandits have all been pacified, but it is impossible for the foreign bandits to escape privately. Those who are to be pacified lack guarantors and have no choice but to put their lives at risk. However, the number is limited, so the bandits' power has been greatly reduced. The former nest of the bandits, Chengmagang in Macheng, has a people's defense team stationed there and is as peaceful as ever. There is no trace of bandits. In the Huang'an and Lishan areas, there are only small groups of kidnappers, which is not a cause for concern. However, there are no less than 30,000 guns hidden in the border area, and the refugees have no clothes or food. If remittances are sent, there is no grain available for purchase locally. If grain is transported, the mountain roads are rugged and difficult to travel. Liu Zhenju now plans to send the refugees to Liu'an, Huoqiu, Qianshan, Taihe, and Hefei for temporary food relief. If the follow-up is not thorough, it is absolutely impossible to avoid a resurgence. (26th)</p>
<h3>Inspection Tour of Gan, Anhui, Xiang, and Hubei (Special Correspondent for this Newspaper, Ren An)</h3>
<p>General Situation of Liu'an Governance After the Disaster</p>
<p>Past Redification Full of Scars</p>
<p>Liu'an Correspondence: Western Anhui has always been known for its richness, bordering Henan and Hubei, with abundant mountains, bamboo, and wood, especially rich in tea and hemp. However, due to traffic congestion, exports are difficult, and a large amount of goods are stored. Not only has its material potential not been fully realized, but the import of politics and culture is also difficult. The people's nature, if not frivolous, is lazy. In the past, officials and gentry used high-pressure tactics to exploit arbitrarily, and arrogant and cunning people incited and bewitched them, leading to deep public resentment, which was seized by the Red Bandits, resulting in the great disaster of Western Anhui. In recent years, the National Army has achieved great victories in encirclement and suppression. The urban and rural towns along the Pi River have been recovered. The Red Bandit pseudo-armies 25 and 28 on the west bank of the Shi River have also been defeated one by one, and most of them have been annihilated. A small number of the remaining bandits, three to five hundred, have fled into the deep mountains and valleys to survive. However, with intensified blockades, they are increasingly lacking oil, salt, and food. If they do not surrender and rehabilitate, they will also perish on their own.</p>
<p>Since taking office, Qin Zhenfu, the Administrative Inspector of the Third District and concurrently the Magistrate of Liu'an County, has made great efforts to promote the pacification of refugees, the protection of the locality, the construction of roads, the increase in production, the implementation of compulsory education, and the exposure of local tyrants and evil gentry. According to local sources, although it has been more than a year since the National Army recovered the counties in the district ravaged by the Red Bandits, the clearing of scattered bandits, the elimination of heresies, the handling of aftermath, the restoration of rural areas, and the newly promulgated important policies such as autonomy, self-defense, and construction have not yet fundamentally taken effect. The reason for this is that the people do not understand the government's administrative methods and have not been able to cooperate in the implementation. Now, the government has established a propaganda section to formulate a propaganda outline and various propaganda materials, which are sent to various counties in groups to go deep into the countryside to explain the methods of implementing new policies, to inform about the need to cooperate in suppressing bandits, and to examine the administrative situation of each county, the suffering of the people, and the urgent needs of the locality, so that nothing can be ordered to each county to be implemented quickly.</p>
<p>When Commissioner Qin Zhenfu first arrived in Liu'an last year, he saw citizens inside and outside the city enjoying the cool in the evening, mostly using cool beds and smoking opium in the streets. After strict prohibition, they gradually disappeared. Opium dens and opium donations were used to fund the Public Security Bureau and the detective team. This July, it was also changed to be borne by the commercial firms. The opium dens were sealed, and the opium equipment was burned. The police and bailiffs, who used to number over a hundred, were mostly unpaid and relied entirely on issuing tickets and collecting extra money. Each ticket was at least ten yuan or more, and extortion was even worse in criminal cases. Now, they have been thoroughly reorganized, and the number of people has been reduced by more than half. The monthly expenses, in addition to the collection of entertainment donations and commercial firm donations, are said to be still less than three hundred yuan. In the officialdom, there are still old titles such as "Your Excellency," "Master," and "Advisor," which carry the stench of the autocratic political system of feudal society. The commissioner has also ordered their abolition.</p>
<p>After the county was recovered, in terms of facilities, more than 100 rural cooperative preparatory societies have been established to relieve rural finance, with loans of more than 39,000 yuan to purchase seeds and plowing cattle to relieve the spring famine. Education is handled in accordance with the outline of educational facilities for the people in the recovered bandit areas, unifying the income and expenditure of educational funds, abolishing the double landlords of school fields, and stipulating the restoration methods of various schools, such as organizing short-term primary schools, investigating out-of-school children, improving private schools, promoting ancestral halls, setting up private schools in guild halls, setting up people's education halls in schools in urban and suburban areas, and especially running teacher training courses to widely train teachers to promote education. Farmers in each village have organizations such as the militia team and the anti-communist volunteer team to take on the responsibility of investigating bandits and protecting public security. The only requirement of the farmers at present is to hope that the scattered bandits will be cleared, the taxes will be reduced, so that they can live and work in peace and contentment.</p>
<p>The Rural Financial Relief Office of the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the three provinces of Henan, Hubei and Anhui has established a county branch in Liu'an, established a rural cooperative preparatory society, and implemented loans. According to the method, farmers in the newly recovered areas who are over 20 years old, have independent living qualifications, and can gather nine people to form a group, and submit it to the county branch for approval, may establish a rural cooperative preparatory society, and borrow money for proper purposes according to the prescribed procedures. After one year, the preparatory society may be changed to a formal "rural credit cooperative". This year, all members of the preparatory society borrow money from the preparatory society, the annual interest rate is one cent. When the preparatory society borrows from the county branch, the annual interest rate is eight li. Each member is jointly and severally liable for the repayment of the debt. Currently, 112 preparatory societies have been established in Liu'an County, with a total of 5,065 members and a total loan amount of 39.490 yuan. Each person averages over seven yuan. The categories of funds used are eight items such as purchasing seeds, food, feed, fertilizer, farm tools, livestock, repairing houses, and others. The largest percentage is the purchase of food, accounting for a little less than 38% of the total, followed by seeds accounting for a little less than 17%, and repairing houses accounting for a little more than 13%.</p>
<p>According to the eyewitness accounts of the county government and local people about the situation during the Red Bandit occupation in the past, most of the title deeds of farmland have been destroyed. Because Liu'an is a county close to the mountains, the fields are uneven in height, so it is impossible to merge them, and they remain as they were. Farming has not been abandoned at all. However, tea mountains and bamboos and trees in the southwest have been cut down a lot. Due to the impact of the blockade, the hemp producing area has no sales market, and the output has been greatly reduced. Many houses in the war traffic zone have been burned. The houses of public offices and wealthy gentry are mostly used as county, district and township Soviet governments. Among the farmers who died, the largest number were those who were gray in attitude, were attacked by both sides, and were forced to serve as bandits and died in battle. Land was distributed in units of villages, and three dou of land per person was the standard. Each dou of land could harvest more than two shi of grain. However, it was limited to small and medium-sized workers and farmers. After the wealthy farmers' properties were confiscated, they could only get barren land. After the land was distributed, work also followed, such as being a detective, guarding, digging trenches, washing clothes, sewing, touching melons (killing people), etc., and there were economic obligations to pay various progressive taxes. Even if there was a surplus after the income and expenditure were equal, it was not much, and they were not allowed to buy or sell or hire people to cultivate. If they were Red Bandits or engaged in pseudo-government work, a substitute farming team would be formed to cultivate for them. If there was a surplus after the distribution, it would be allocated to the public and operated by the substitute farming team. Cash and women's jewelry were absorbed and recast into silver coins, which the people were forced to use. There was also the Pseudo-Henan, Hubei, and Anhui Border Province Soviet Farmers Bank, which indiscriminately issued paper money. Although pseudo-cooperatives tried hard to steal and sell bamboo, wood, tea, hemp, and other items outside the bandit area, they could not do it due to the strict blockade. Prices gradually fell, and finance became increasingly depleted, which can be imagined. Lenin Primary Schools were set up in various villages to promote redification, and personnel were sent by the Pseudo-Soviet government to teach without special funding, which was easy to promote. If there were mutual attacks or secret accusations, a general meeting of the whole township would be called to make a public decision. In addition to ordinary crimes, they would be punished with corvée and imprisonment. If they were convicted of being reactionary, they would be immediately brutally killed. Even the closest relatives were not allowed to have any pity. In total, the number of farmers who joined the bandits was about 15,000, mostly poor farmers, hired farmers, and craftsmen. Among the craftsmen, barbers were the most. After the recovery, about 12,000 people surrendered themselves, mostly the old, weak, and young. Most of the able-bodied men were forced to serve as bandits or engaged in pseudo-Soviet government work, and died in the repeated encirclement and suppression wars or in the bandits' mutual killings (such as exposing AB groups, reorganization factions, and using terrorist policies to suppress rebellious elements). Only a very limited number of people are still fleeing elsewhere.</p>
<p>As for the method of handling the recovered land, it is based on Articles 13 and 15 of the Regulations on Land Handling in Bandit Suppression Areas promulgated by the Bandit Suppression Headquarters of the Three Provinces. The county government announces registration, and the owners receive management certificates, restore the original land rights according to the original boundaries of the land, and cultivate their own land. Those who have done important work during the banditization, or are quick-witted, especially literate youths, are transferred to the reformatories run by the government to receive special education. They graduate in March and return to their hometowns.</p>

<h3>Suspicious Person Found in Inn</h3>
<p>Xu Jinsheng from Fengjing was lodging at the Xie Sheng Inn last night when he was encountered by a police inspection. At that time, Xu Jinsheng was holding banknotes in his hand and looked flustered. When questioned, he claimed to be a painter in a lacquer shop on Foch Road in Shanghai, and came to Songjiang to open a lacquer shop, and then claimed to be traveling. His words were contradictory. When asked about the amount of banknotes, he stared blankly and did not know the number. Therefore, an inspection was carried out, and a leather suitcase and rattan suitcase were found, with a camel's hair robe and 71 yuan in silver inside the suitcase. He also claimed that he would go to Pudong, then Songjiang was not a necessary place to pass, which was quite suspicious. Fearing that it was related to a theft case, Xu Jinsheng, the banknotes, suitcases, etc. were sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>A Minor Quarrel Leads to Murder</h3>
<p>Li Dai, a young woman at No. 32 Guan Alley, Sibaidu, outside Changmen, quarreled with her neighbor Pan Li a few nights ago over a minor matter. The next day, Li Dai suddenly swallowed opium and still went to Pan Li's house to talk. At that time, Pan Li saw that her expression had changed, asked about the situation, and immediately sent her to Gengsheng Hospital for treatment. However, due to excessive poisoning, she died at 10 pm. The police station in charge sent Pan Li to the station for interrogation, and at the same time reported to the District Procuratorate to send someone to inspect.</p>
<h3>Famous Lawyer Accused of Libel</h3>
<p>Lu Hongyi, a famous lawyer in Suzhou, pointed out two weeks ago at a banquet hosted by Lin Biao, the President of the High Court, for the Minister of Justice, that the Judicial Investigation Committee had committed dereliction of duty and malpractice. The next day, President Lin suspended Zhu Zhongqi, a member of the Judicial Investigation Committee. Zhu believed that Lu Hongyi deliberately set out to damage the reputation of others, so he filed a self-complaint with the Wuxian District Court on the charge of libel. After the court accepted the case, it scheduled a hearing on January 10. At that time, there will be a grand debate between the two parties.</p>

<h3>Apprentice Murders Master</h3>
<p>Tang Minggen, a villager in Yangming Township, Beiqiao Street, Third District of the county bureau, 38 years old, opened a bamboo shop in the street. There was one customer master in the shop, named Shen Rongbo, and three apprentices. The eldest apprentice was named Ji Chulin, 19 years old, from Yangzhou. On the 25th of this month, Ji returned to his hometown from Ximen in the city and brought back eight glutinous rice balls. He asked Tang Minggen if he was hungry. Tang ate three of them because he had not eaten dinner. When he ate the fourth one, he took a bite and suddenly felt that the taste was different, so he immediately threw it to the ground. At that time, his youngest apprentice, Wang Mingzhuang, was holding one next to him, also took a bite, felt a different taste, and threw it away. Unexpectedly, after a short while, both of them felt upset and vomited non-stop. By midnight, customer master Shen Rongbo returned. Tang told him what had happened, and knew that there was something wrong. He repeatedly questioned Ji, and finally got the truth. Ji said that he had used the excuse of using medicine for sores in Ximen and bought arsenic at a certain drugstore, mixed it into the glutinous rice balls, and lied to the master to eat it, in order to murder him, etc. After hearing this, Shen immediately used egg white salt soup to irrigate the two of them. Wang Mingzhuang has recovered because of the lighter poisoning. Tang Minggen is still out of danger, in a coma. After this incident happened, the First Resident Office of the Eighth Branch of the Public Security Bureau in charge arrested Ji Chulin that night. According to the confession, the poisoning was instigated by Tang Minggen's brother, Mingda. The office sent a police officer to summon Tang Mingda. Because Mingda was also seriously ill in bed, he could not be brought to justice. Someone temporarily guaranteed him. Ji Chulin was temporarily detained in the bureau. Tang Minggen sent someone to Yangzhou to invite his father to Wuxi to negotiate.</p>

<h3>Wage Dispute Resolved at Qingfeng Factory</h3>
<p>Workers from the Qingfeng Silk Factory in Wuxi came to Changzhou to ask Wanfengtai Tobacco Shop for their wages. The matter was delayed for two days and could not be resolved.

Yan Zhichen, the assistant manager of the Qingfeng Silk Factory, came to the county to receive the money. The factory will be responsible for raising and distributing another 1,800 yuan and dismissing the workers in the factory. All account books and ledgers of the Qingfeng Factory are limited to the responsibility of Hui and Yan to be handed over to the Wuxi County Chamber of Commerce within three days for regular liquidation. The workers' representatives were satisfied. At about 6 pm, Hui and Yan arrived at the county and received the 2,500 yuan of workers' wages. At about 8 pm, they led the workers back to Wuxi by car.</p>

<h3>Donglai Town Robbed by Bandits</h3>
<p>Donglai Town, in the Fourth District of this county, has convenient transportation and a flourishing market. It is the leading town in the northwest of Changshu. The residents of the area are very simple and most of them are well-off. At about 7 pm on the night of the 27th of this month, suddenly 70 to 80 sea bandits came from the northeast riverbank, all armed with guns, and robbed the town. When they arrived in the town, they first confiscated all the guns and weapons of the patrol boats of the Third District Water Police stationed in the town, and cut off the telephone lines before starting the robbery. All households and shops were spared. The area has Shanghai branch-set-up Xin Xin, Zhen Xin and other yarn factories flower collection offices, and Shen Yantai rice mills, Shunfeng flower trade, suffered heavy losses. At the time of the robbery, traffic was cut off and order was disrupted. Fortunately, the mayor Fan Dongsheng urgently sent a special messenger to Lu Yuan Town (about six or seven li away) to report to various places by telephone. After the Xigang District Office and the Xitangqiao Public Security Bureau learned about it, it was already around 9:30. When the team was sent, the thieves had gone far away. The thieves also robbed when they passed through Black Star Port. According to statistics, the losses in the two towns are about tens of thousands of gold.</p>

<h3>Fairness Project Bridge Completed</h3>
<p>The Gongdao Bridge in the northern township of Jiangdu is no less in length than the Wanfu Bridge in the eastern township. The bridge was completely washed away after the great flood in the autumn of the 20th year. For a time, traffic was blocked. Local gentry Wang Shaohe and others raised funds to rebuild it, and the bridge embankment was built with soil and trees were planted to consolidate the embankment. The project area lasted for two years, and it was recently completed, and traffic has been completely restored. Yesterday (26th), in order to prevent tree felling and damage to the embankment, the association publicly submitted the case to the Ninth District Office and forwarded it to the county government for announcement and protection.</p>

<h3>Capital Film Inspection Committee Works Tensely</h3>
<p>Since Li Jiaxiang took over as the Standing Committee Member of the Capital Film Inspection Committee, the handling of all committee affairs has been even more strict than before. At the beginning of his tenure, Li convened a meeting with all the inspection agents stationed in Beijing to inquire whether there were any difficulties or negligence on the part of the staff in the meeting, so that the staff could be ordered to reform to avoid difficulties for the agents. Recently, as the end of the year is approaching, the film companies have been very crowded to send their films to the committee for inspection. In order to take care of the film merchants, the committee inspects them day and night, inspecting about five feature films and ten short films every day. Moreover, after each day's inspection, those who are approved for screening, Li will personally urge the responsible staff to issue licenses on schedule, so the working hours of the staff in the committee are increased by two hours to seven sentences before they stop working. It is also heard that because the committee is required to take three days off for the New Year as usual, the films to be inspected on New Year's Eve, if approved for screening, will also be issued licenses within the year, so as not to be delayed in the committee for a long time.</p>

<h3>The Chance of War in Fujian is Imminent</h3>
<p>Fujian Redification Shops Closed</p>
<p>Air Force is Weak, Less Than Twenty Aircraft</p>
<p>Certain Army Advances, Foreigners Safely Relocated</p>
<p>Great War Within Ten Days - Shanghai Shishi News Agency: The situation on the Zhejiang-Fujian border has become quite tense in recent days. There have been occasional contacts on the front line. The Shishi News Agency reporter met a certain member of the Central Committee staying in Shanghai yesterday. According to the talk, according to recent news from a certain source, the Fujian side has decided to concentrate its efforts to fight the Central Army. Now, due to the terrain, there is no room for development in all directions, and the economy is tight and the military strength is weak. It is really impossible to conduct large-scale operations. Because the current operations of the Fujian side are purely defensive, there will never be a direct conflict for a while. As for the plan adopted, it is quite similar to that of the Red Bandits against the Central Army. Judging from the current situation, the main force of the Central Army's current operations is still the army and air force, which have been largely arranged. According to the observation of the current situation, the war is imminent, about no later than one week after New Year's Day. At that time, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee will be opened, and the political situation will have a considerable impact on this.</p>
<p>Fujian Guests Talked About Redification - Ouyashe News Agency said: According to a certain gentleman from Fujian Province in Shanghai yesterday, a large number of fellow villagers from various parts of Fujian have fled to Shanghai recently. Every ship arriving in Shanghai is full of these people. What the newspaper reported yesterday that those who fled from Fujian Province to Shanghai were mostly to avoid the war. In fact, this is just a part of the reason. However, there are other reasons. Since the Fujian side has moved from a tacit military understanding with the Communist Party to a political fusion, the two sides have demarcated areas of defense and made a covenant of offensive and defensive alliance. Now Changting, Yongding, Longyan and other counties have been officially handed over to the Communist Army by the pseudo-government to be stationed and governed. The local wealth and upright gentry have fled and are completely in a state of redification. If the Central authorities do not actively suppress the Fujian rebellion, it is feared that Fujian Province will follow the example of the counties in the Jiangxi bandit area and become an irrecoverable situation.</p>
<p>Yanping Recovered Confirmed - Huadong News Agency said: Regarding the news that Yanping has been recovered by the Central Army, the Huadong News Agency reporter specifically inquired from the Telegraph Bureau of the Ministry of Communications in this city. According to the bureau, the commercial telegraph line from Shanghai to Yanping has been able to reach Yanping via Pucheng since yesterday. Therefore, the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau has resumed receiving telegrams to Yanping as usual yesterday. This is a definite proof that Yanping has been recovered. In addition, the information received by the local authorities from the front said that the Central Army had indeed left the south side of Jian'ou a few days ago and arrived in Nanping. Nanping belongs to the first county of Yanping and is not far from Yanping. Therefore, it is indeed possible for the Central Army to reach Yanping.</p>
<p>Limit the Chamber of Commerce to Pay Huge Sum of Money - Xinxin News Agency said: According to the Fujian merchants in Shanghai who received a telegram from Xiamen yesterday, the telegram roughly stated that the Fujian government has been extremely financially strained since it announced its establishment. Now, in order to prepare for the invasion of Zhejiang, the military expenses required are very large. A special envoy has been sent to the Chamber of Commerce to declare that it is limited to paying 500,000 yuan immediately and must not delay military affairs. It is learned that most of the shops in Fuzhou, Zhangzhou and other cities have now unanimously closed and temporarily suspended business.</p>
<p>Fujian Air Force is Weak - Dabai News Agency said: The air force strength of the Fujian side is very weak. It is found that the Fujian side has planes, in addition to the four captured from the former reorganized Zhang Zhen troops, the four or five detained from the reorganized Chen Guohui troops, and the few owned by the Communist Party and the Social Democratic Party. In addition to the original several aircraft, 12 new aircraft were ordered from abroad, but only six have been shipped, totaling less than 20. Most of them are reconnaissance aircraft, and only two or three are bombers. Moreover, there is no aviation talent and no combat effectiveness, so the aircraft have been hidden in remote places.</p>
<p>Surrendered Army Has Advanced - Riri News Agency said: It has just been reported from a certain military agency in this city that after the 19th Route Army Independent Regiment surrendered to the Central Government, they supported Qian Yuguang as the regiment commander. The troops have established contact with the Central Army and have now crossed Pucheng and are advancing towards Nanya from Jian'ou. The vanguard battalion □ had a brief contact there last night. The other party is in an encircled situation, and there will be a fierce battle within a few days.</p>
<p>Foreigners Safely Relocated - Ouyashe News Agency said: According to news from the foreign community in this city, after the Central Government notified all foreigners to relocate to safe areas as soon as possible, the consuls of various countries in Fuzhou and other places immediately ordered them to relocate. Japanese citizens had already moved to Cangqianshan on the 24th, and other British, American and French nationals also evacuated one after another. When necessary, they will board the warships of their respective countries stationed in Fujian. Yesterday, Mr. Moriya, the Japanese Consul General in Fuzhou, sent a telegram to the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai to report the safety of the country's citizens.</p>
<h3>Establishment of the Association of Fujian West Shanghai Groups to Save Hometown</h3>
<p>The Association of Fujian West Shanghai Groups to Save Hometown was established at the Weiya Restaurant on Sima Road at 3 pm yesterday afternoon. More than ten representatives including Wu Yuwen and Su Qi attended the meeting. Wu Yuwen was elected chairman and Chen Huimin was the recorder. First, the chairman reported that Western Fujian is a densely populated and resource-rich area of Fujian. Since the Communist bandits occupied Changting and captured Yan Yong in the 20th year of the Republic of China, most of our fellow villagers have been displaced and have taken refuge in foreign lands. There are also tens of thousands in Shanghai alone. Although there were organizations of various township associations before, there was no overall contact. In order to concentrate the strength of the groups and seek the welfare of the homeland together, this association was specially organized. Then, the proposals were discussed and it was decided that (1) the declaration proposal will be handed over to the Executive Committee for handling, and (2) the amendment of the articles of association will be passed. Then, the executive committee was elected. As a result, Wu Yuwen, Su Qi, Lai Xueping, Chen Huimin, Fan Jianqiu, and others were elected as executive committee members. They had a dinner and dispersed.</p>
<h3>Minhou County Chamber of Commerce Reports Business Conditions</h3>
<p>Since Fujian formed its own government and separated from the Central Government, the news has been spread, and everyone has different opinions. Yesterday, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce received a reply from the Minhou County Chamber of Commerce in Fujian. The business community seems to have undergone abnormal changes. The letter is recorded as follows: After receiving the letter, it was immediately forwarded to Guangjitang Western Medicine Store. According to Lin Qinghan, the representative of the store, because the store owed the 56th Division more than 20,000 yuan, all the Guangji, Youji, and Jihua stores, Su Guang western medicine and various goods were moved by the division to the Yangkou branch. First, they were occupied by the Communists, and the remaining goods were also moved to be auctioned off. Now there are only remnants left.</p>
<h3>Bao Wenwei and Rong Zhen Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Decided to Go to Hong Kong Tomorrow to Welcome Zhang Xueliang</p>
<p>Zhang to Arrive in Shanghai on the 8th Aboard the Conte Rosso Liner</p>
<p>Summoned Back to China by Chiang Kai-shek, the Central Government Will Grant Him a Title</p>
<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Bao Wenwei, Director of the Beiping Military Branch Office, Rong Zhen, Counselor, and Tang Guozhen, Mi Chunlin, and others, have arrived in Shanghai one after another in preparation to go to Hong Kong to welcome Mr. Zhang Xueliang, former Chairman of the Beiping Military Branch Office, who is about to return to China. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Former Subordinates of Zhang Arrive in Shanghai: Northeast Army Generals Arrive in Shanghai en Route to Hong Kong to Welcome Zhang Xueliang. In addition to Mr. Tang Guozhen, who arrived in Shanghai several days ago, Rong Zhen, Counselor of the Beiping Military Branch Office, Mi Chunlin, Gao Jiyi, former Director of the Beining Railway Bureau, Liu Mingjiu, former Director of the Liaoning Industry Department, and Zhang Hengyue, the current Director of the Shijiazhuang Jingjing Mining Bureau, also arrived in Shanghai the morning before last on the Beijing-Shanghai overnight express train. Mayor Wu Tiecheng hosted a dinner at the Shanghai Municipal Government Reception Center on Xiafei Road at 7 p.m. the night before last to welcome everyone. However, Gao Jiyi was unable to attend due to illness. Bao Wenwei, Director of the Beiping Branch Office, also arrived in Shanghai the night before last from Beijing by train, accompanied by his wife and staff.</p>
<p>Decision to Go to Hong Kong the Day After Tomorrow: It is now reported that Rong Zhen and others have purchased tickets for the French邮船宝岛斯（Bǎodǎo sī - transliterated name） liner and are scheduled to leave Shanghai for Hong Kong tomorrow (30th) to welcome Mr. Zhang Xueliang. The liner is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Japan today and berth at the north wharf of the China Merchants Bureau. At that time, Endanna will also go to Hong Kong and stay there for a few days. He is scheduled to accompany Zhang Xueliang on the Italian liner Conte Rosso to Shanghai on the 6th of next month, arriving here around the 8th. Bao Wenwei and others are scheduled to leave Shanghai for the south on New Year's Day.</p>
<p>Rong Zhen's Remarks During the Trip: According to Mr. Rong Zhen, in an interview with a reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency, Zhang's return to China this time is indeed in response to a telegram from Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Affairs Commission. He will stay in Shanghai temporarily after his arrival, and a residence has not yet been found. He will first meet with Chairman Chiang. Rumors that the central government will appoint him as Minister of Aviation or invite Zhang to go to the Northwest are not true. However, the central government will grant Zhang a considerable title for this visit. Only bodyguards and attendants will accompany Zhang. Zhang's wife and younger brother, Xueming, are still in England for the education of their children and did not come with him. The situation in North China is very good, and the market is quite stable. After the reorganization of the Northeast Army, there are still about 30 divisions, including about 16 infantry divisions, 5 cavalry divisions, 3 artillery brigades, and 5 other divisions. Military pay has been issued seven times this year. Due to economic difficulties, the pay is often issued at a discount of 60%, 70%, or 80%. In the future, we plan to find an appropriate solution to this problem. Xue Zhong and Wan Fulin are both unable to go south to welcome Zhang due to official duties.</p>
<h3>Fuzhou Authorities Take Over the China Merchants Bureau Branch Office Buildings</h3>
<p>Troops from the Anti-Smuggling Bureau Stationed There</p>
<p>Fuzhou News: The local government has dispatched personnel to take over the buildings of the Fujian branch of the state-run China Merchants Bureau and has stationed troops there. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Anti-Smuggling Team Takes Over: At the beginning of the Fujian Incident, the People's Government did not take over the buildings of the Fuzhou branch of the China Merchants Bureau. Recently, the Anti-Smuggling Team of the Ministry of Finance of the People's Government, due to the lack of accommodation for its soldiers, sent personnel to investigate. The conclusion was that the China Merchants Bureau was a state-run organization and that its Fuzhou branch should be taken over for official use. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance first sent a representative to the bureau to explain the purpose to the director of the Fuzhou branch of the China Merchants Bureau and then dispatched troops to station there.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Inspects: At the same time, the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau sent Section Chief Lei Yulin, along with personnel from the Anti-Smuggling Team of the Ministry of Finance, to the branch office and ordered the director to vacate all the buildings in the bureau for the receiving personnel. Lei Yulin of the Public Security Bureau was also dispatched to the bureau to supervise the inspection. At that time, the personnel in the branch office did not dare to resist due to the pressure of force and had to agree to move out.</p>
<p>Troops Have Moved In: After the Anti-Smuggling Bureau of the Ministry of Finance took over, the soldiers of the Anti-Smuggling Bureau immediately moved into the bureau. It is now reported that all the buildings of the branch office have been occupied by the anti-smuggling soldiers, and the devastation is indescribable. It is also said that the warehouses of the branch office have not yet been occupied by the People's Government.</p>
<p>Encourage the Operation of Liners: The members of the receiving committee of the China Merchants Bureau's Fujian branch, such as Lei Yulin, did not take over the small steamships owned by the bureau when they took over the buildings. According to Lei and others, although the China Merchants Bureau is a state-run organization, the People's Government is actively protecting the traffic of commercial ships and will not allow accidents to happen. Why has your bureau's Fuzhou liners stopped sailing? You can continue to operate as usual. We guarantee that there will be no unexpected dangers.</p>
<p>Report to the Shanghai Head Office: After the branch office was taken over by the People's Government, the director of the Fujian branch has already found ways to move and store all the business accounts and official documents to avoid loss. At the same time, he has submitted a report to the general manager of the Shanghai head office, Liu Hongsheng, for verification. It is reported that the address and buildings of the branch office were previously mortgaged to a certain bank, and there is a creditor-debtor relationship. Now that they have been taken over by the Fujian authorities, a letter should be sent to the creditor to inform them.</p>

<h3>Sanbei's Shanghai-Jiang Liner Hongli Runs Aground in Jianli</h3>
<p>Following the loss of Sanbei Company's Qingpu steamer, disasters continued with Wanxiang and Hengshan's collision. Now, the Yangtze River upstream liner Hongli has run aground in Jianli. Misfortunes have been accumulating. The situation is described in detail below.</p>
<p>Grounding in Jianli: Recently, the water level in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River has been receding very quickly. The water level at Chenglingji is only zero inches, making navigation very difficult. In the past week, the Changsha liners of various companies have been blocked in that area. This time, the Sanbei Company's Hongli steamer, sailing from Changsha, Hunan, back to Shanghai, ran aground on the Jianli River on the morning of the 27th of this month due to the sharp drop in the river water. When the Shashi Sanbei branch received the news, it immediately tried to send a ship to rescue it.</p>
<p>Hongzhen Damages Blades: Sanbei has four ships operating on the Hunan-Changsha route. After Hongli ran aground, the Shashi branch originally planned to send Hongzhen, which was on the upper river, to rescue it. Unexpectedly, Hongzhen's propeller blades were damaged and it could not sail to Jianli for a while. Therefore, another ship could only be sent to tow Hongli. The Shashi branch has telegraphed the Shanghai head office.</p>
<p>Hongheng Goes to Rescue: The company's Hongheng steamer is currently sailing upstream from downstream to Hunan. The Shashi branch has ordered the ship to sail to Jianli to try to tow Hongli out of the shallows. Rescue is currently underway. Details are still awaiting further reports. Also, the case of the company's Hengshan steamer colliding with and sinking a sand barge in Zhenjiang is being handled by the Zhenjiang Customs. The contents of this matter can only be fully understood after Hengshan returns to Shanghai and the shipowner is questioned. Hengshan, which ran aground on the riverbank in Nanjing, has been towed out and is now loading cargo and will be able to sail to Shanghai soon.</p>
<h3>Temporary Market for the National Goods Movement of the Special District to Open Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Opening Ceremony to be Held at 11 AM on the 30th</p>

The letter to the Taxpayers Association said, "To whom it may concern, our association's temporary market is scheduled to open on the 30th of this month.

<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders China Merchants Bureau to Stop Hiring Foreign Seafarers</h3>
<p>No Renewal of Employment After Expiration of Term</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Merchants Bureau recently received an instruction from the Ministry of Communications that the general manager's office of the China Merchants Bureau stop hiring foreign captains, and that foreign captains and crew members not be rehired after the expiration of their terms. Chinese crew members should be promoted according to their qualifications in order to safeguard navigation rights. The original text recorded by the Daily News reporter is as follows: "According to the China Merchant Seafarers' and Drivers' Association, 'When the China Merchants Bureau was first established, most of the crew members at all levels were foreigners. This was because Chinese people lacked nautical talents and had to borrow talents from foreign countries, resulting in the loss of sovereignty, which is deeply regrettable. Fortunately, in recent years, Chinese people have worked hard and are gradually becoming more proficient in nautical knowledge. Crew members at all levels in the bureau have begun to be filled by Chinese people. After the bureau was placed under the management of the National Government, the principle was that crew members at all levels would be filled by Chinese people, and vacant positions would be filled by promotion according to qualifications. Therefore, the number of Chinese people serving as crew members in the bureau has gradually increased, and there are also many Chinese people who have been promoted to captain. It is fortunate that nautical sovereignty is gradually being recovered, which is a glory for the country. Since Chinese people have served as captains, they have been careful and cautious, and their achievements have been excellent. In the past, when foreigners served as captains, accidents occurred frequently, such as the confiscation of the Xinhua, Xinji, Xinchang, and Xinkang steamers, which is clear evidence. Furthermore, according to the laws of various countries, for the sake of sovereignty, captains are mostly filled by their own nationals. Moreover, the high salaries of foreign captains are a waste of the national treasury, which is a minor matter. We have now heard that the bureau has the motivation to re-employ foreign captains, such as recently hiring a foreigner to serve as the captain of the Xinfeng steamer. This not only violates the inherent principle, but also fears that nautical sovereignty will be lost again. This is a matter of heartbreak. We do not know what General Manager Liu of the bureau is thinking, putting the country's navigation rights aside? The association, seeing this situation, cannot remain silent and hereby submits a report to your department, ordering the general manager that foreign captains who are in office not be re-employed after the expiration of their terms, and that when there is a vacancy for a captain, Chinese crew members should be promoted according to their qualifications, and no more foreigners should be hired, so as to safeguard navigation rights, which would be fortunate for the country.'" Based on this, in addition to the instructions, it is hereby ordered that the bureau investigate and submit its opinions for verification. This order."</p>
<h3>Clerks of Two Radio Stations Strike Yesterday Due to Dissatisfaction with Treatment</h3>
<p>Ministry of Communications Orders Immediate Return to Service</p>
<p>Removal and Dismissal for All Who Fail to Report by Deadline</p>
<p>The clerical staff of the International Radio Station and the Shanghai Wireless Telegraph Office, both under the Ministry of Communications, went on strike at 0:05 yesterday morning due to dissatisfaction with the treatment stipulated by the Ministry. The Ministry of Communications ordered the two stations to publish a notice in the newspapers, ordering all personnel to return to their posts by the deadline, otherwise they would be dismissed. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preferential Treatment for Radio Operators: The staff of the radio stations are divided into three departments: technical (i.e., engineers, etc.), telegraphic (i.e., sending telegrams, etc.), and clerical (i.e., receiving and sending telegrams, collecting payments, accounting, general affairs, etc.). The treatment for technicians is at least 70 yuan per month and at most 360 yuan. The treatment for telegraphers ranges from 32 yuan to 300 yuan. The treatment for clerical staff ranges from 32 yuan to 160 yuan. Those whose salaries are below 40 yuan will receive an increase of 3 yuan for each grade promotion. Those whose salaries are above 40 yuan will receive an increase of 4 yuan for each grade promotion. The maximum increase for each grade promotion is 10 yuan.</p>
<p>Performance Evaluation and Promotion: The Ministry of Communications recently promulgated the "Rules of Operation," which contains measures for performance evaluation and promotion. Performance evaluations are conducted every six months and are divided into three grades: excellent (3 points), good (2 points), and average (1 point). Those who have accumulated 6 points in performance evaluation will be promoted by one grade, which will increase their original salary. At the same time, it is stipulated that one-third of the total number of employees in each radio station can enjoy the excellent grade. Therefore, there must be two excellent grades each year in order to be promoted by one grade. If each performance evaluation is average, it will take three years to be promoted by one grade.</p>
<p>Requests for Improvement: Because the duties of the clerical staff are easier than those of the other two departments, they rarely enjoy the excellent grade in each performance evaluation and must take at least one and a half years to be promoted by one grade. The Ministry of Communications also subsidizes technicians 12 to 50 yuan per month, and telegraphers 8 to 35 yuan per month, but clerical staff receive nothing. Therefore, they requested to be subsidized as well, at least 16 yuan per month, and also requested to reform the performance evaluation system.</p>
<p>Declaration of Strike: There are a total of 154 clerical staff in the two radio stations. On the 26th of this month, they jointly submitted a request to the heads of each station to forward the request for reform of the subsidy and performance evaluation to the Ministry. However, no reply has been received since the submission. The staff believe that the Ministry does not agree to their request, so they left the office at 0:05 this morning during the shift change and declared a strike.</p>
<p>Telegraph Service Unaffected: Although the staff of the two stations had previously requested improvement, they had not received a message with a deadline for a reply, so they were not prepared in any way. However, the duties of the clerical staff are not very important. Before 7:00 AM yesterday morning, the technical and telegraphic staff temporarily took over their duties and urgently telegraphed the Ministry for instructions. Personnel were also drawn from the branch stations and the Da Bei, Da Dong, and Pacific Sanshui Electric Companies to cope with the situation. Therefore, the telegraph service was not affected.</p>
<p>Ministry Orders Strict Handling: The International Radio Station and the Shanghai Wireless Telegraph Office, after telegraphed to the Ministry for instructions at 0:15 AM yesterday morning, received a reply from the Ministry at 4:05 PM, which stated that the staff had gone on strike and that a notice should be published in the Shen Bao and Xin Bao newspapers on the same day, ordering the staff to return to their posts and continue to serve. If they fail to report by the deadline, they will all be removed and dismissed. After receiving the order, the two stations have decided to publish a notice today to summon them.</p>
<p>Employees' Attitude: According to the striking personnel, because the bureau did not give a responsible and concrete reply, their attitude is very firm. They have all signed their names, unanimously demanding five conditions. There is no background to the demands. The responsible personnel of the two stations are deeply aware of this, but if the incident is prolonged and expanded, the responsibility will be borne solely by the authorities.</p>

<h3>Naval Veteran Du Xigui Dies of Illness in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Remains Moved to International Funeral Parlor Yesterday</p>
<p>Funeral the Day After Tomorrow, Condolences from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>Admiral Du Xigui, after the outbreak of the Fujian Incident, led the students of the Mawei Naval Academy to Beijing, and then returned to Shanghai. He died of pneumonia in his Shanghai residence at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. Those who heard the news mourned his death. Yesterday morning, his family had moved his remains to the International Funeral Parlor, and the funeral is scheduled for the day after tomorrow. Condolences have been received from all walks of life. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>After Arriving in Shanghai: Du Xigui, principal of the Mawei Naval Academy in Fujian, left Fujian on the Sanbei Shipping Company's Wanxiang ship on the 25th of last month with all the students of the Naval Academy and the naval training camp soldiers. He arrived in Shanghai on the 27th and took the original ship to Beijing again on the evening of the 28th, placing all the students in the Naval Torpedo School to study, so that their studies would not be interrupted. After Du had settled the students, he arrived in Shanghai from Beijing by train on the 2nd of this month, residing in his private residence at No. 146, Lane 146, Fuli Road, French Concession.</p>
<p>Sixtieth Birthday Celebration: Du Xigui was 60 years old. He held his sixtieth birthday celebration in Shanghai on the 20th of this month. Naval units stationed in Shanghai and the generals of the ships stationed in Shanghai went to congratulate him because Du was a veteran of the Navy, such as Chen Jiliang, commander of the First Fleet of the Navy. The occasion was very lively that day. Du personally greeted the guests and his spirit was still strong. He was planning to return to Beijing to preside over the affairs of the Naval Academy after his birthday, but unexpectedly he fell ill, which is very sad.</p>
<p>Dies in Shanghai Residence: Although Du was old, his health was good. On the morning of the 25th of this month, he felt slightly unwell and had a severe cough. His sons immediately hired a doctor to treat him. He was diagnosed with pneumonia. His condition suddenly worsened on the 26th. Despite treatment by famous Chinese and Western doctors, he passed away at 2:00 PM on the 27th due to his old age, leaving behind one concubine and two sons. His eldest son and wife and concubines are all in Shanghai. His second son is in the Naval Academy in Beijing and immediately came to Shanghai to mourn upon receiving the telegram.</p>
<p>Funeral the Day After Tomorrow: After Du's death, his remains were transported to the International Funeral Parlor at No. 207 Jiaozhou Road yesterday morning. The funeral is scheduled to be held at 3:00 PM on the 31st of this month. The Xin Sheng News Agency reporter went to the International Funeral Parlor yesterday and learned that Du's remains had been transported to the parl</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sanctions Yongyichang Customs Broker for Reporting Substandard Newspaper Cargo</h3>
<p>Shipped to Chongqing via Datong Steamer</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce received a report yesterday from the Paper Trade Association, stating that ten packages of Japanese newspaper, bearing the name "Meihua Trading Company of China," were declared by Yongyichang Customs Broker, located at Fushen Lane, Zhengjia Bridge, for shipment via the Datong steamer to Hankou, Yichang, and onward to Chongqing. The report requested that the Chamber of Commerce inform the Customs Broker Association to thoroughly investigate the consignor and strictly punish them as a warning. The Chamber of Commerce forwarded the letter to the Customs Broker Association for investigation, but the Association replied that Yongyichang Customs Broker was not a member of their association, and thus they were unable to conduct a thorough investigation into the declaration of substandard paper. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce responded with a stern letter, stating, "Although the firm is not a member, it is still in the same trade. It is difficult for it to escape the notice of the paper industry, and even more difficult to escape your Association's discerning eyes. While a thorough investigation may be difficult, a discreet inquiry is easier to undertake. As for punishing members, the most severe measures are fines or expulsion, all of which are sanctions on reputation. Yongyichang Customs Broker is in the same trade, and there must be business dealings between firms in the same trade. If you can admonish your members to regard them as public enemies in terms of morality and righteousness, cutting off dealings and stopping mutual assistance, the effect may surpass sanctions on reputation. Your Association's patriotism should be second to none, so there is no need to fear difficulty and shirk responsibility."</p>

<h3>China National Aviation Corporation's Southwest Route Test Flight Canceled Yesterday Due to Fog</h3>
<p>Test Flight to Begin Once Fog Clears in Changsha</p>
<p>In order to facilitate southwest transportation and meet the needs of Guangxi and Yunnan provinces, China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) is planning to open a southwest route from Hankou via Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan, to Chongqing. The test flight, originally scheduled to depart from Hankou yesterday morning, was canceled due to fog. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Test Flight Plan: After completing the Shanghai-Peiping, Shanghai-Chongqing, and Shanghai-Guangdong trunk lines, CNAC began preparing to open the southwest route. In October of this year, two test flights were conducted from Chongqing, but both were aborted in Guiyang due to poor weather. Therefore, the plan was changed, with the flight departing from Hankou, flying to Changsha and then to Guangzhou, stopping overnight before flying to Wuzhou, Nanning, and then to Longzhou overnight. The next day, it would pass through Kunming and fly directly to Chongqing. If the weather is good, it may detour via Guiyang, as the climate along the entire route is most unfavorable in Guiyang. Therefore, it is planned that if the weather is bad, it will fly directly to Chongqing.</p>
<p>Test Flight Personnel: A Stinson aircraft will be used for the test flight, piloted by Chief Pilot Ericson. Accompanying him will be Mr. Nie Kaiyi, Deputy Director of the Aviation Department, and Mr. Huang Baoxian, Business Manager. It is said that Mr. Huang will remain in Guangzhou to investigate business conditions there. After the test flight is successful, the company will begin preparing for the opening of the route and plans to purchase new twin-engine aircraft for the line.</p>
<p>Postponed Due to Fog: The plane was scheduled to depart from Hankou yesterday (the 28th) morning, but due to heavy fog between Hankou and Changsha, the company decided to postpone the flight for safety reasons. The weather in the southwest is currently quite clear, and the test flight will begin as soon as the fog clears in Changsha.</p>
<h3>China National Aviation Corporation to Increase Flights on Chongqing-Chengdu Section on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Four Times a Week on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays</p>
<p>After the completion of the Shanghai-Chengdu route by China National Aviation Corporation, the Chongqing-Chengdu section was scheduled for flights from Chongqing to Chengdu on Tuesdays, Thursdays, Saturdays, and Sundays, once a day. A Heping News Agency reporter learned from the company yesterday that due to the increasing volume of mail transport on that section, the frequency of flights will be increased to four times a week, on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays, starting on New Year's Day. The post office has been officially notified accordingly.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance to Advance Payment of Government Bond Principal and Interest</h3>
<p>To Be Paid by Designated Banks Starting on the 30th</p>
<p>The 31st of this month is the date on which the Ministry of Finance will begin repaying the principal and paying interest on various bonds. However, that day falls on a Sunday, and January 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of next year are New Year's holidays, during which banks will be closed for three days as usual. A Shenshi News Agency reporter learned yesterday that, in order to protect the interests of bondholders, the Ministry of Finance will advance the payment by one day to December 30th. A letter has been sent to the Government Bond Fund Management Committee for verification. The Committee, upon receiving the letter, has issued a public notice stating that the advance payment will be made on the 30th by the designated banks.</p>

<p>At the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association Central Auditorium and Lake Society</p>
<p>The War Zone Disaster Relief Association, in view of the suffering of the disaster-stricken people in the Northeast war zone, who are displaced, starving, and freezing, with the old and weak crying out in misery, which is unbearable to witness, has received repeated letters from the Northeast requesting relief. Monk Xuhui and others recently gathered colleagues to prepare relief. At this time of financial exhaustion, there is no good method. After discussion, it was decided to hold a variety show to raise funds for relief. It will be held during the year-end and new year holiday season when people from all walks of life are celebrating. It is learned that the association has made thorough preparations and will hold the show for four days, from the 31st to the 3rd, at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association and the Central Auditorium and Lake Society. Invitations have been sent to various performing arts circles, all of whom have agreed to participate. The programs are all wonderfully exciting. Ticket prices are one yuan, two yuan, and five yuan.

It is expected that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically participate.</p>
<h3>Poorhouse Sheltering Over a Thousand Destitute People</h3>
<p>Borrowing Wood Planks to Build Additional Sheds</p>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organizations United Association's temporary poorhouse in southern Shanghai, established on the 24th of this month, has sheltered general poor people and unemployed laborers. As of yesterday, the first location housed 269 people, the second location housed 516 people, and the third location housed 327 people, totaling 1,112 people. Shanghai gentlemen and merchants, such as Mr. Zhang Xiaoliang, mindful of the bankruptcy of the countryside and the decline of industry and commerce this year, with more unemployed people than in previous years, felt that the current location was insufficient. Yesterday, he borrowed a large number of wood planks from the Jiuji Lumber Company and the Zhenchang and Zhensheng Lumber Yards and sent them to the poorhouse to hire workers to build additional sheds, so as to maximize accommodation. Mr. Wang Yiting and Mr. Huang Hanzhi have raised funds from enthusiastic donors, including Mr. Pang Yitai, a benefactor, who donated 500 yuan, and the Pushan Villa, which donated 300 yuan. Mr. Lu Bohong has agreed with the Zhabei Water and Electricity Company to donate 200 yuan, which have all been sent to the association for the relief of poor people in the poorhouse.

<h3>Military Officer Becomes a Thief After Losing His Job</h3>
<p>Robbery of Shanghai Bank Employee's Home for Jewelry</p>
<p>The Thief Studied Aviation Skills in Germany</p>
<p>Huang Shaoling, a 26-year-old Cantonese man residing at No. 33 Huaneng Road in the French Concession garden villa, a senior employee of two Shanghai commercial banks, was quite wealthy and newly married, possessing many precious items, thus arousing the covetousness of thieves. On September 22nd of this year, at around 10:00 AM, Huang went to work, and his wife also went out, leaving only his elderly mother and several maids at home. Suddenly, three thieves in Western suits, speaking with a Cantonese accent, rushed in through the back door under the pretext of delivering a letter. One thief held a handgun, and the other two held a long and short knife each. One thief monitored the homeowner's family and servants, while the other two went upstairs, looting cash, diamonds, jadeite, jade, gold ingots, and other various ornaments, totaling 10,000 yuan. After Huang found out upon returning home, he provided a list of the lost items, drew images of each item, and reported it to the police, requesting an arrest. Initially, the detective secretly investigated the maid Deng Er'a's whereabouts, but found nothing unusual. The detectives then sought external leads for the arrest. On the morning of the 22nd of this month, Chief Inspector Jin Jiulin of the special agency, leading detectives in conjunction with the Public Concession Police, arrested a Cantonese thief named Xu Shude (also known as Yin Jia), age 30, at Tianfu Lane on Laobazi Road. He was taken back to the police station, and the next day, he was escorted to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. After a detailed investigation by the police, Xu confessed that he had studied in Germany, where he attended the Berlin Aviation School. After graduating, he returned to China and served as an aviation combatant in the Army Department of Shanxi Province. In the 16th year of the Republic, he served as the commander and staff officer of the vanguard detachment. In the 19th year of the Republic, he left the military and came to Shanghai, where he worked as an actor for the Youlian Film Company. He was unemployed in July of this year and lived at No. 5 Funing Lane, Jiujiang Road. On the morning of September 15th, at 10:00 AM, a fellow villager friend, Wang Jing, came to visit and chat. I initiated the plan to rob the Huang family, and Wang agreed. Thus, on the morning of the 22nd of that month, at 8:00 AM, we opened a room at the Nanjing Hotel on Sanma Road to meet. Wang came with his friends Mai and Yazhu. Wang gave me a knife. Wang waited at the hotel, and I went to Huang's house with Mai and Ya to commit the robbery. I monitored the homeowner's family, and Mai and Ya committed the robbery. After returning to the Nanjing Hotel, we divided the loot. Wang made the assignments, and I received 300 yuan in cash, a pearl ring, a diamond ring, a gold hairpin, a gold cross, and other items, totaling 19 items. I then scattered and pawned them, using the money for expenses. When I returned from Nanjing, on the morning of the 22nd of this month, I went to the home of my friend Huang Zongru at No. 25 Tianfu Lane, Laobazi Road, to borrow travel expenses and was arrested when I arrived at the alley entrance. Based on his confession, the detective went to the Zikang Pawnshop at No. 553 North Sichuan Road, the Yuefeng Pawnshop on North Henan Road, and the Xiankang Pawnshop at the Eight Immortals Bridge, as well as the Dacheng Jewelry Store in Xiaguan, Nanjing, to retrieve the original stolen ornaments. Yesterday morning, Judge Li Changnian of the Second Special District Court interrogated him in the Criminal Court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the facts of the case and the police's investigation process and filed a public prosecution under Article 348 of the Criminal Law for robbery committed by a group of three. He also submitted the defendant's confession to the police station as evidence. Furthermore, Huang Shaoling's wife and her aunt arrived to testify about the robbery and requested severe punishment of the defendant and the recovery of the remaining stolen goods. When questioned, the defendant Xu Shude's testimony was the same as his confession to the police. He also stated that he lost his job due to the outbreak of the Shanghai Incident and, being troubled by food and clothing, was forced to take a risk and commit the crime. He requested lenient punishment so that he could still serve the country after being released from prison after serving his term. He referred to himself as a sinner and expressed deep hatred for the Japanese for invading Shanghai and causing him to lose his job and commit crimes. After reviewing the confession, the court appointed lawyer Wang Shizong to defend the defendant and then declared the debate closed. The sentencing was scheduled for the morning of the 30th, and the defendant was returned to custody to await instructions.</p>
<h3>Dispute Over the Admission of Substandard Goods at the Yarn and Cloth Exchange</h3>
<p>Not Meeting Appraisal Standards</p>
<p>Willing to Compensate Customers for Losses</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Yarn and Cloth Exchange previously admitted substandard goods in October, disregarding the appraisal of the appraisers and damaging customers, causing customers to rise up in opposition, which caused a great storm and led to the resignation of all appraisers under their joint names, which caused the May floral auctions to not be held. And the customers had a meeting to vote to pursue them in court for fraud and breach of trust. It was previously reported. It is learned that the institution knew it was wrong, so it asked people to mediate and was willing to apologize to the customers and compensate them for more than 40,000 yuan to make up for their losses, so as not to cause a bigger storm. The organization also invited all the appraisers to dinner the night before to apologize and to discuss the resumption of the floral auctions in May. The results are unknown and will be tracked in the future. However, it is learned that some of the customers were able to accept the case because the end of the year was approaching, and they were afraid that their finances would be stranded. But some customers believed that the fraud and breach of trust by the organization was not appropriate, so they expressed their willingness to bear the losses and pursue the case in court to maintain the future of the customers and to warn others in the future.</p>

<h3>Shooting on Shanhai Pass Road to Arrest Thieves, Stray Bullet Kills Driver</h3>
<p>Two More Thieves Arrested at the Andong Hotel</p>
<p>Driver's Body Examined Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>At 11:30 AM the previous morning, three thieves from Suzhou, Zhou Yingen, Xu A'gen, and Qian A'mu, each carrying weapons, went out to rob. They first rented car No. 17708 from the Yitai Automobile Company on Hubei Road, driven by the driver Pan Lanfang. When they arrived at Shanhai Pass Road, they ordered the car to stop. Zhou and Xu got out of the car one after another and went to Wanchun Sauce Garden at No. 301 Shanhai Pass Road. Xu held a gun at the entrance to keep watch, and Zhou also held a gun and broke into the store, threatening everyone to remain silent. He robbed the shop of twenty-one yuan and thirty cents in large and small silver coins from the counter, as well as a gold ring from the finger of a woman, Wang Chenshi. He and Xu exited the shop, boarded the car, and tried to escape. At that time, Wang Chenshi's son, Wang Muxian, was also present. After the thieves left, he blew the whistle frantically and followed behind, reporting to the nearby station post Hua police No. 2976. After the police received the report and saw the car pass by, he immediately pulled out his gun and fired five shots. At this time, two other Hua police, No. 2763 and No. 882, hearing the gunfire, also assisted in the pursuit and fired two shots. The car's driver, Pan Lanfang, suddenly heard the whistle and gunfire and realized that the people in the car were thieves. Fearing harm from the thieves if he stopped the car, he unexpectedly jumped out of the car, but the car continued to move forward without a driver, crashing into a utility pole. The Hua police behind him were already following and boarded the car, arresting Zhou on the spot. The other two thieves escaped in the meantime. All of the stolen goods were found on Zhou, and a pistol was seized, with eight bullets inside. However, when the Hua police fired their guns, a cart driver from the Sanyou Company at No. 201 Shanhai Pass Road, Shen Yuxi, age 30, from Jiangbei, was passing by and was hit in the intestines by a stray bullet, damaging the large intestine. He fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. After the Xinza Police Station was notified, detective Ma Derong and a Western detective arrived and took the injured man to the hospital, but due to the severity of his injuries, he died at 1:30 PM. The body was sent to the Feilun Road coroner's office. Zhou Yingen was taken to the police station for questioning. Under interrogation, he admitted that he and the escaped Qian and Xu had committed the robbery and confessed that Xu and the others were hiding in Room 129 of the Andong Hotel on Hubei Road. Chinese and Western detectives went to arrest them, but Xu and the others had been there after the robbery, but had escaped five minutes earlier. So, detectives were stationed there. In the evening, two men from Anhui, Wang Chunfang, and a man from Zhejiang, Hong Yangbao, went to Andong 129 and were arrested by the detectives and taken to the police station for custody. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Criminal Court No. 8 of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated the previous situation and requested a postponement. Then, the Chinese and Western detectives and the victims Wang Chenshi and the witness Wang Muxian successively filed cases to prove everything. After Judge Xue Lanru briefly interrogated Zhou, Wang, and Hong, he ordered them to be detained for later questioning. Soon after, Prosecutor Diao Chengtang, appointed by the prosecutor's office of the Special Court, went to the office to examine the body of Shen Yuxi. After ascending to his seat, he interrogated again. Since he could not find any records of the body, he ordered Pushan Villa to collect the body on his behalf.</p>
<h3>Xu Shiying, Relief Commissioner for Henan and Hebei, Will Return to Shanghai</h3>
<p>A Drop in the Bucket, Difficult to Provide Universal Relief</p>
<p>The Yellow River Flood Relief Group had previously sent personnel with funds to Shandong, Henan, and Hebei to provide relief separately. According to Mr. Xu Shiying, speaking to a reporter from the Eurasia News Agency, the Shandong relief commissioner has completed the relief work and returned to Shanghai. The Relief Commissioner to the Huaxian area of Henan, the Buddhist monk Hongshan, and the Relief Commissioner to the Chang, Pu, and Dong three counties of Hebei, Mr. Ma Zuwu, have recently reported that the disaster situation there is extremely serious, with too many monks and too little porridge, making it difficult to provide universal and generous relief. The association is also well aware that it is a drop in the bucket, and feels deeply regretful that its heart is willing but its strength is insufficient. It is now that the relief work of these Relief Commissioners is about to be completed, and they will return to Shanghai one after another next month.</p>

<h3>Opposition to Provincial Tax on Woodworking in the French Concession</h3>
<p>Chen Juchang Would Rather Sacrifice Business</p>
<p>Small woodworking shops in the French Concession have never been subject to sanitation or business taxes. According to the regulations of the Public Works Department, only small industrial workshops with five or more employees are subject to taxation. However, this time, Chen Juchang's small woodworking workshop in Shenjiaqiao on West Pubuh Stone Road, which employs only three workers, unexpectedly received a notice from the Health Department last month, introducing a sanitation tax of two yuan per year. The workshop owner refused to pay the tax, as there had never been such a tax before, and was fined five yuan by the French police. However, he still refused to acknowledge the tax. Unexpectedly, he was summoned to the police station again and fined ten yuan. The workshop owner refused to comply and was prosecuted by the French police in the Eighth Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court. At the first trial, he was ordered to pay a fine of two yuan and obtain a permit from the Health Department of the French Municipal Council. The workshop owner argued that there was no such tax among his peers and that he should not be the first to acknowledge it, thereby disrupting industry regulations. He refused to accept the original judgment. Yesterday was the date for the second trial, and the Eighth Criminal Division again ruled that he must pay a fine of five yuan and apply for a permit from the Health Department of the French Municipal Council within ten days. The workshop owner still refused to comply and refused to sign the penalty. He then left the court and was given ten days to appeal. In order to fight for the interests of his fellow tradesmen, the workshop owner went to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the French Concession to report the circumstances of the court trial and his refusal to accept the penalty. After mediation by the association, it was found that the regulations of the Health and Business Tax of the French Municipal Council stipulated that, in addition to the previous court confirmation that those with five or more employees were subject to taxation and those with fewer than five were exempt, further reasons would be detailed and a request would be made to the court on his behalf for tax exemption. However, Mr. Chen Juchang, the workshop owner, is sixty years old and makes a living from this small woodworking business. If forced to comply, he would rather stop business operations and avoid the pain of excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies from his fellow tradesmen. The association specially offered comfort and encouragement, and Mr. Chen expressed his gratitude and said,</p>

<h3>Further News on the Rejection of Workers' Return to Work by the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory</h3>
<p>The Factory Denies Falsely Reporting Robbery</p>
<p>The Industrial Society stated that yesterday's incident at the Da Zhonghua Rubber Factory in the city, where workers were rejected from returning to work and a conflict ensued, has been reported in various newspapers. Yesterday, the reporter from the Industrial Society specially drove to Xujiahui to visit the factory负责人 and the work foreman. According to them, the factory has been operating for a long time and has always adopted a recommendation and guarantee system for employees, which is different from recruitment. Both quality and quantity are emphasized, and their treatment is excellent, which is well known in society. Therefore, both labor and capital are in harmony and have never had any disputes. This time, seven workers who were dismissed earlier for incompetence initiated the preparation of a trade union and, at the same time, took the opportunity to demand reinstatement. The factory stated that reinstatement would be considered only after both parties had negotiated and agreed. However, these dismissed workers went to the factory yesterday while the factory manager was away on business, making a loud commotion and tearing the clothes of the staff. They also tore up the party documents they brought with them, intending to frame the factory. The factory, as it was during working hours and feared disrupting order, especially telegraphed the police station to send police to maintain order. The report that the factory falsely reported that the workers had stolen is not true.</p>

<h3>Sixth District, Second Precinct Arrests Extortionist</h3>
<p>Formerly a Student in the Nineteenth Route Army</p>
<p>Passed Through Hangzhou and Borrowed Travel Expenses</p>
<p>Yin Qicheng (also known as Luo Lin), a local resident living at No. 155 Huixi Street, Xujiahui Town, Shanghai West, formerly a member of the International Volunteer Corps, is now 40 years old. He built a new-style house in the past, so his family is quite well-off. Recently, he was coveted by bandits and received a threatening letter, causing great worry to his family. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 am yesterday, two men in old military uniforms and Zhongshan suits, holding letters, asked to see the owner to borrow travel expenses. Yin's concubine, Tan (from Baoshan, 30 years old), seeing that the men were unfamiliar and definitely not good people, politely refused and secretly followed them to observe their movements. When they walked to the Yang Baolian rice store, Tan reported to police Fan Junjun, who was on duty at the second post there. He and Acting Police Chief Li Yun jointly stepped forward to arrest them. Seeing that the situation was not good, the two bandits fled towards the French Concession. They were later arrested by French police No. 455 and taken back to the Béthune Road Police Station. Bi Zhenhua, the director of the Sixth District, Second Precinct, ordered the detective Yang Zhongjin to bring the two bandits back to the precinct for interrogation. According to the man in military uniform, he was Wu Xin, 25 years old, from Hunan. Because of the Fujian Incident, he and Wang Zhigang, who was in custody, came to Shanghai by boat from Xiamen on the 19th of this month. During the January 28th Incident in the year before last, he was a student in the Nineteenth Route Army. He now plans to go to Hangzhou to find a job. Because he lacked travel expenses, he passed by Huixi Street, saw the Yin surname boundary stone erected under the wall, so he bought stationery at the cigarette paper store, wrote a letter, and pleaded with the person in charge to borrow travel expenses. A copy of the original letter and a certificate of the Nineteenth Route Army Volunteer Corps were found on Wu's body. One named Wang Zhigang, 26 years old, from Wuxing, gave a similar confession to Wu. According to the confession, Director Bi considered the case to be related to sending threatening letters and had already prepared a document to send to the bureau for investigation yesterday.</p>

<h3>Robber Who Shot a Guard on Duty Tried and Concluded</h3>
<p>Found in a Yilinchun Teahouse</p>
<p>Stolen Goods and Guns and Bullets Seized</p>
<p>Patrol Leader Identifies and Sets a Date for Sentencing</p>
<p>Robbers Zhou Maoxian, Lin Xiaogui, and Wang Weichun from Jiangbei, along with a gang, robbed Zhou Bocheng's home at No. 4 Huatongfang, North Xizang Road, Yangzhou, on the morning of the 3rd of this month at 7:40 am, taking cash worth 43 yuan, gold rings, and other items. They fled after pushing open the door. When the Chinese and Western detectives from the Hongkou Police Station heard the alarm, they rushed to chase. The robbers fled wildly from Manzhou Road and Kulun Road in Zhabei. They were stopped by Zhang Liankui, Zhou Peixin, and Liu Qingxin, the police officers on duty in the fourth district. They opened fire and resisted arrest, and the three police officers were all shot and fell to the ground, taking the opportunity to escape without a trace. Afterwards, Patrol Leader Wu from the fourth district arrived and sent Zhang Liankui and others to Baolong Hospital. Police Officer Zhang suffered the most severe injuries and died at 1:00 am on the 8th. The three robbers, Zhou, Lin, and Wang, were arrested by Chinese Detective Chief Shi Sijian and Detective Bao Shuji from the Hongkou Police Station in the Yilinchun Teahouse on Jiujiang Road. A Mauser pistol used by Zhou to resist arrest, containing three bullets, and stolen goods, including two gold rings, were seized. They were sent to the First Special District Court for detailed interrogation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan presided over the criminal court to investigate. The police lawyer Zhang Dayin stated that witnesses Zhou Shengpei and Patrol Leader Wu had arrived in court and requested questioning. According to Zhou, he was setting up a zifantuan stall in front of a coal store on Manzhou Road in Zhabei. At that time, he suddenly heard a police whistle and saw a police officer chasing a robber from Guoqing Road. He heard two gunshots. The police officer was shot in a vital part by the second shot and fell to the ground. He could not see the faces and figures of the robbers clearly. Patrol Leader Wu then testified that Police Officer Zhang Liankui said in the hospital that he was shot by a robber wearing a blue cotton robe and about 40 years old, which matched the defendant Zhou Maoxian. When questioned, the defendants' confessions were still the same as in the previous court hearing. Judge Wu ordered them to be returned to custody and set a date for sentencing.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, Having read the news item titled "Tenants of Hexing Lane Oppose Rent Increase" in the local news section of your newspaper on the 28th of this month, we find it is inconsistent with the facts. Our accounting office proposed a rent increase this time to compensate for the sharp increase in donations, taxes, and water fees. This matter has been agreed upon with Xu Zhenya and Yin Changhuan, the fully authorized representatives of all the tenants in Hexing Lane, to increase the water fee, etc., by 20% of the original rent to show consideration. Unexpectedly, the news item stated that our accounting office colluded with the representatives using monetary means and that our agent, Lawyer Zhang Deqin, threatened Zhang Jinkui and Chen Ruzhang to withdraw from the agency relationship. Not only are the facts completely fabricated, but they are also deliberately damaging our reputation. Also, the news report on the mediation court situation changed the judge's in-court advice of "increasing the water fee, etc., by 20%" to "it is impossible to increase the rent." This is a distortion of the court record. In addition to Zhang Jinkui and Chen Ruzhang withdrawing from the representative relationship, there is an announcement on the cover of the Xinwen Daily, etc., on the 17th of this month, which can prove the truth. In addition to taking legal action on the part that damages the reputation of our accounting office, we are concerned about confusing the truth. Therefore, we have sent this special letter to you, hoping that your newspaper will correct it immediately to avoid confusion. Thank you very much. Sincerely, Deji Accounting Office, on behalf of the landlord. December 28, 1933.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment - We would like to thank the Commercial Press for the gift of one copy of the English Weekly, No. 63, and two copies of the Children's Pictorial, Nos. 26 and 27. Thank you.</p>

<h3>Next Year's Plan for Railway Business and Joint Transportation (Continued)</h3>
<p>Yu Yan, Director of the Business Department of the Ministry of Railways and Director of the Joint Transportation Office</p>
<p>(E) Increasing Transport Capacity - Railways must first have sufficient equipment to provide sufficient transport. Among the most important equipment, vehicles are the most important. Most of the roads in our country now feel that vehicles are in short supply. The fundamental reason is that vehicles are not sufficient in the first place, and there are many cases of vehicle inefficiency in operation, which makes the degree of shortage even more profound. In this situation, in order to enable the roads to have sufficient vehicles, on the one hand, we should try our best to use the existing vehicles to achieve their maximum effectiveness. On the other hand, we should also find ways to add new vehicles in order to fundamentally remedy the situation. Regarding the former, since taking office, I have followed the statistics of cargo ton-miles and freight car tonnage of the roads in 1919 and 1920 to show the degree of efficiency of vehicle use on the roads, so as to check the performance of vehicle use at any time. I am now engaged in formulating methods to improve vehicle distribution, which will be implemented in the coming year. In addition, we will take measures to shorten the loading, unloading, and transportation time of vehicles on the roads at any time, rush to repair damaged vehicles, and ban the detention of vehicles by the military, so as to increase the efficiency of vehicle turnover. Regarding the latter, the plan is roughly as follows: I have studied the methods of adding vehicles, which can be temporarily divided into four types: first, renting. This method can relieve the emergency for a while, but it is questionable whether vehicles can be rented at any time to meet the urgent needs. Second, self-manufacturing. This method is difficult to implement because railway machine factories mostly only have repair equipment. If the organization of machine factories is expanded to manufacture vehicles, it cannot be completed in a short period of time, nor can it be done with the current financial resources. Third, buying on credit. Conditions are agreed with the seller, and payment procedures are stipulated, and the purchased vehicles are used as collateral. Fourth, buying with cash. If cash can be raised, this method is the simplest and most direct. After careful consideration of the situation of the ministry and the roads, it is proposed to first use the last method. The ministry plans to raise funds to order vehicles for the roads, and after the vehicles arrive, they will be rented to the roads for use, and a corresponding rent will be collected to be used to repay the principal and interest of the vehicles. This matter is currently being planned. The above-mentioned opinions on increasing transport capacity are only in terms of vehicles. To increase transport capacity, it is naturally not limited to the issue of vehicles. Other equipment, such as how to add turnouts at each station and how to expand marshalling yards, to facilitate vehicle turnover, etc., will also be improved as far as possible.</p>
<p>(F) Improving Railway Freight Rates - Whether the freight rates set by a country's railways are appropriate affects not only its own business greatly, but also the price of goods, the stagnation of goods, the prosperity of the region, the civilization of the people, the prosperity and decline of various industries, and the quality of life of the people throughout the country, all of which are closely related. It goes without saying that it should be studied carefully and regulated carefully. At the beginning of the establishment of railways in our country, the right to set freight rates was controlled by foreigners. They were mostly isolated from the situation in our country and lacked research on the principles of freight rates. They arbitrarily set prices without standards, or even took the interests of foreign merchants as a prerequisite, ignoring the affordability of freight for domestic goods. The roads that were repaired later were not examined, and they were blindly copied, so that the movement of various goods was mostly inappropriate, either too high or unfair. There is a need for a complete reorganization. Moreover, since the implementation of responsible transportation, a 10% surcharge has been added to each freight rate. Whether the freight rate after the price increase is appropriate and what the impact is must also be reviewed and improved. Therefore, it is proposed to thoroughly reorganize the various factors that make up the approved freight rate: (1) The current freight grades are divided into six grades. It is proposed to study them in detail and appropriately increase them to ten grades. (2) The basic freight rates vary greatly from road to road. It is proposed to find ways to calculate the transportation costs of each road and then set them based on the transportation costs. (3) As far as possible, each road should try to use the method of gradual distance reduction, starting from roads with roughly equal mileage. (4) The proportion of freight rates between each grade varies from road to road, and even on the same route it is inconsistent. It is proposed to compare them with each other, study them in detail, and then reorganize them separately. (5) The proportion of the difference between the full car freight rate and the less-than-full car freight rate is 30% in some cases, 50% in some cases, and other proportions in some cases. It is proposed to conduct thorough research before reorganizing them. (6) The minimum weight of full car cargo. Our country's roads have no regulations to date, so the freight rates for loose and bulky goods are often difficult to calculate properly. We are now working on regulations for the minimum weight of various goods for various vehicles. Once the regulations are completed, they will be announced and implemented. Not only will the weight problem of loose and bulky goods be solved, but the proportion of the difference between the full car freight rate and the less-than-full car freight rate can also be used to make appropriate decisions. In short, the freight rates of railways in our country are mostly inappropriate and unfair. We must adhere to the spirit of developing railway business and revitalizing domestic industries as a fundamental reorganization plan. Although it is a major issue and may not be accomplished in a short period of time, we dare not fail to do our best to seek reorganization.</p>
<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>A Commoner's Loving Mother</h3>
<p>— Zhan Lu</p>
<p>The south eaves receive the sun, making winter warm. It is said that the winter sunlight is a yellow cotton coat or a natural stove, but these are only partial metaphors. To put it succinctly, it is simply a commoner's loving mother.</p>
<p>The warm room where commoners stop is, of course, the pleasure palace of the propertied class. If you are born with a bitter fate, you are only fit to run in the wind and snow and seek a living in the ice and frost. If you accidentally want to rest for a while in front of the door of the pleasure palace, you will either be scolded by the arrogant servant or barked loudly by the pretentious Pekingese dog. Fortunately, there are only snobbish people and snobbish dogs, but no snobbish sunlight. Wherever the thatched cottage and the sloping eaves are, where the bourgeoisie cannot reach, this commoner's loving mother will also come, embracing many poor people with frozen hands and feet, trembling all over, and giving them considerable comfort.</p>
<p>Every time the morning light is revealed, the blessed people who are sleeping soundly in the gold-decorated tents are reluctant to let the light in, because they do not need the dazzling sunlight. Only the poor people with runny noses, seeing the morning light, throw themselves into the embrace of nature's loving mother. Every ray of light is their lifeline. Even if they face the cold and do their hard work, under the protection of the loving mother, they can always reduce their pain. Suddenly, a patch of red clouds covered the face of the commoner's loving mother. The people in the gold-decorated tents happily got up to prepare invitations to open a banquet and enjoy the snow. Poor commoners, having lost the protection of their loving mother, had to spend another miserable cold night with runny noses.</p>
<p>I remember a great scholar who wrote about his childhood poverty, saying that in order to resist the bitter cold of the long night in the tattered quilt, he and his mother sat back to back, waiting for dawn. Only when the morning light broke through did they happily feel alive. It can be seen that even with the loving mother embracing them closely, the extremely poor people still cannot get rid of the cold. Only when this loving mother high in the clouds shows her face can there be hope of escaping death. Poets have always compared the loving mother to the spring sunshine, but it is not the spring sunshine. The commoner's loving mother is only this winter sunshine, which is as warm as embracing cotton.</p>
<h3>A Review of Historical Materials on Diplomacy in the Late Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Da</p>
<p>There are three principles for studying the history of diplomacy in the late Qing Dynasty: first, credibility with evidence; second, detailed, substantial, and profound; and third, new documents. In general, the diplomacy of the Republic of China began in the late Qing Dynasty. Important documents at that time were not disclosed as a rule. Those who compiled historical books either relied on the writings of Chinese people or recorded the records of foreigners. It is a pity that it is not possible to get a glimpse of the whole picture from a few fragments. After reading the book "Historical Materials on Diplomacy in the Late Qing Dynasty" compiled by Mr. Wang Taofu and his son Wang Xiyin, I felt that it has made new contributions to these three principles. Here is a brief description:</p>
<p>First, according to the Qing system, princes led the Grand Council and concurrently managed the Zongli Yamen (Foreign Affairs Office). All important documents, even if they were not copied and distributed, were fully available to the Grand Council. The historical materials on diplomacy in the late Qing Dynasty were collected by Mr. Taofu when he worked in the Grand Council. The documents in this collection, regarding the process of establishing unequal treaties, consular jurisdiction, and the loss of tariff autonomy, as well as the meeting minutes of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and various envoys, are all collected without omission, which can be said to be credible and well-documented.</p>
<p>Second, diplomacy in the late Qing Dynasty was the most onerous. The details of various diplomatic issues such as the Yantai Treaty, the Tibet negotiations, the occupation of Myanmar, and the cases of Pianma, Hong Kong, Weihai, and Kowloon, etc.; the cases of Sino-American negotiations such as the protection of overseas Chinese, the General Arbitration Treaty, and the refund of indemnities, etc.; the cases of Sino-French negotiations such as the Franco-Vietnamese collusion, the Sino-French War, the border affairs of Guangdong, Yunnan, and Guangxi, and the Guangzhou Bay and Siming Guild Hall cases, etc.; the cases of Sino-Japanese negotiations such as the Sino-Japanese War, the cession of Ryukyu and Taiwan, the annexation of Japan and Korea, the return of Liaodong and Lushun, and the Shazipu, Nagasaki, Ershinmaru, Yanji, Dongsha Island, Luda Tianbaoshan logging, fishing, and the three northeastern provinces cases, etc.; the cases of Sino-German negotiations such as the dispatch of troops to Shandong and the leasing of Jiaozhou Bay, etc.; the cases of Sino-Russian negotiations such as the return of Yili, the leasing of Lushun, the Sino-Russian Secret Treaty, the Russo-Japanese War, the return of the three northeastern provinces, and the navigation of the Songhua and Heilongjiang rivers, etc.; and the cases of Sino-Italian negotiations such as the Sanmen Bay and Tianjin Yancha cases, etc., all of which are not available in ordinary history books, can be found in this compilation. It is very detailed, substantial, and profound.</p>
<p>Third, in this book, there are many new unpublished documents, such as the treaty agreed upon by the Zongli Yamen and Japan in the sixth year of Guangxu due to the Sino-Russian Yili issue; the correspondence files of the Sino-French negotiations on the Annam issue; Li Hongzhang and Weng Tonghe's memorials on peace and war when the Sino-Japanese War of Jiawu was about to break out; the documents on the private request of Li to go to Russia to make a secret treaty after the Sino-Japanese War; and the documents on Li's request to the court to take the blame for his actions when he went from Guangdong to Shanghai during the Boxer Rebellion. What is particularly valuable is the diplomatic history of the Xuantong Dynasty, which is extremely rare in today's publications. It can be said that all of them are documents that we have never seen before. Today, the loss of the four northeastern provinces is actually based on these documents. Here is a brief list of the major ones: the documents on the Sino-Japanese conference on various cases in the eastern provinces; the documents on the Sino-Korean border dispute cases; the correspondence files on Russia's invasion of the three northeastern provinces and the Xinjiang border; and the reports of envoys stationed abroad on the secret agreements between Russia and Japan. All of these have never been publicly announced in the past.</p>
<h3>Men and Women</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>Sister A'bao returned to Yang Village from Shanghai, dressed in gold and jade. At the age of twenty-nine, wouldn't she look as glamorous as a sixteen or seventeen-year-old girl in the eyes of the people of Yang Village?</p>
<p>Brother A'bing, seeing Sister A'bao's extravagance and liveliness, was very jealous and also set an auspicious day to go to Shanghai. Three years later, Brother A'bing returned, still a poorly dressed poor scholar!</p>
<p>Shanghai is the same Shanghai, and Yang Village is the same Yang Village, but Sister A'bao is a woman, and Brother A'bing is always a man!</p>
<h3>Mixed-Blood Child</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>In several articles I have published in this journal, I seem to have frequently brought up the useless topic of how Chinese people are. Perhaps some may suspect that I am not Chinese.</p>
<p>On this point, I also feel very guilty. But after thinking it over, it seems that we cannot find a good impression on Chinese people. All Chinese people in the intellectual class can feel this. So, what can I say!</p>
<p>The reason why I keep harping on about Chinese people is that, although I dare not harbor the grand ambition of "criticizing the world," I am confident that my enthusiasm for "Chinese people to be good" is second to none! However, whether Chinese people can be good is another matter. It is a mistake to give up grumbling just because grumbling is ineffective!</p>
<p>As the editor of this journal said: "The hope of China lies in the general children of today." I have also found many opportunities to talk to them, but what they can give me is always somewhat "disappointing"! Especially "mixed-blood children" make me feel particularly sad!</p>
<p>I found a child of about seven or eight years old, born to a Chinese father and an American mother. He was very familiar with me and often brought the Blue Sky with a White Sun flag to my place to play. I pointed to the small flag in his hand and asked him in English—because he couldn't speak Mandarin—"What is this?" He replied, "This is a national flag."</p>
<p>I said, "Is this the flag of the United States?" The answer was: "No, this is not 'our' flag, this is 'your' Chinese flag!"</p>
<p>Ah! Think about it, the terms "you" and "we" were already deeply imprinted in his mind! This little thing!</p>
<p>I asked him again: "Your father desperately teaches you to write Chinese characters, speak Chinese, and read Chinese books. Aren't you a Chinese? Do you want to be a Chinese?" He replied, "No, I want to be Japanese!" I asked him why? He said Japanese planes are more powerful than Chinese planes. At the same time, he made gestures, pursed his little mouth, and rhythmically shouted "Ooh... bang... bang..." as if instructing me on the situation of the bombs falling!</p>
<p>Of course, it's no wonder I got angry. I shouted loudly, "Shut up!" Before the next sentence, "Get out," could be uttered, he had already slipped away!</p>
<p>Since then, he has not dared to meet me. On this point, I feel very happy!</p>

<h3>Chapter 21:  Whispered Advice Under the Lamp, Exhorting the Weakling, Coldly Watching Heroes From The Foot of the Mountain</h3>
<p>In the past, Gui Zhi would always retort every sentence her mother said. But today, for some unknown reason, her mother's words seemed to have a deeper meaning, and she dared not say much, lowered her head, and walked into her bedroom. The more she was like this, the more suspicious Madam Jiang became. She sat in the room for a while, pushed open the door, and looked at the sky, muttering to herself: "Oh! In a little while, the dark clouds are all over the sky. It may rain again tonight. I'll go outside to check the weather. It's better if it doesn't rain, because I still need to take apart the quilts and wash them tomorrow." As she said this, she walked out. Outside the gate, two children from the neighborhood were still playing by the road. Just as she was about to inquire, one of the children came up and asked: "Madam Yang, did your eldest daughter find the key she lost?" Madam Jiang said, "How do you know she lost her key?" The child pointed to the ground in front of him and said: "Eldest Daughter Yang was dazed there for a long time, looking for it for a long time." Madam Jiang said: "She doesn't usually walk that way, how could she have gone there?" The child said: "Are you saying I'm accusing you wrongly? If you don't believe me, go back and ask Grandpa Gan San, and you'll know. He was standing there, talking to Grandpa Gan Er for a long time." When Madam Jiang heard this, she couldn't help but feel a cold sweat from every pore on her body. She glared at the child and said: "I told him to collect old debts from Grandpa Gan Er. What could they have to say?" She explained to Gui Zhi in this way, but her heart was pounding, thinking that Gui Zhi, this child, was indeed acting strangely lately. Just seeing her hide a photo of Grandpa Gan Er under her pillow when she sleeps, she knew that her talk with Grandpa Gan Er was not an ordinary appointment. She kept this matter in her heart and felt uneasy. In the evening, Gui Zhi, whether she was deliberately pretending to be calm or extremely bored, took a few small newspapers and read them by the lamp. Madam Jiang also held a newly cut piece of fabric and sewed a short coat under the lamp. The mother and daughter sat together, sharing one corner of the table. (280)</p>

<h3>Recollections of a Trip to Min (Part 1)</h3>
<p>A few months ago, I had the opportunity to visit Fuzhou, the capital of Fujian Province, twice. Traveling across the vast ocean was a first for me in my life. Such a grand tour should be recorded, but I, being a lazy person, find it very difficult to pick up a pen and write. Therefore, I procrastinated for a long time and didn't write a single word. Recently, I saw in the newspaper that the Fujian under the rule of the 19th Route Army is in turmoil again. Only three months have passed, but the situation is hazy. Writing down these random thoughts can be considered as leaving a trace of my experiences.</p>
<p>Fuzhou is located in the southern part of our country. From Shanghai, it takes about forty-seven or forty-eight hours by boat to reach. According to experienced sailors: "The waves in the South Seas are soft, while the waves in this ocean are hard. Hard waves are easier to bear, while soft waves are difficult to endure." Therefore, the waves on the way to Fuzhou are very difficult to bear. However, being stubborn by nature, I don't buy into anything easily. I thought that in the Huangpu River in Shanghai, I had been on small sampans with raging winds and waves, and had never been seasick. How could I get seasick in a ship with a wider area? Little did I know that by the time we left the Wusongkou and reached the waters of Ningbo, my head was already unstable. Later, I couldn't even sit, and couldn't eat. I only ate some porridge. This sea journey was like spending a few days sick. It wasn't until the ship was approaching the Mawei that the ship became stable, and my heart felt like waking up after being drunk, and I slowly felt refreshed.</p>
<p>Mawei is a strategic point of Fuzhou, also known as Mawei, and also has the names of Madu River and Matou River. That place has overlapping mountains and deep harbor waters that can accommodate large ships. After the ship enters the port, it twists and turns. All around are mountains. When the mountains end, a turn reveals green waves and overlapping green hills, which is a whole new world. "When the mountains and rivers are exhausted, one doubts there is no road ahead, but a village appears with willows and flowers in bloom." This kind of realm is truly indescribably pleasant. Mawei is one of the reasons why Fuzhou haunts my dreams. However, I went to Fuzhou twice and passed through Mawei four times. Every time I passed through, listening to the weeping water, my heart was always unhappy, because Mawei fifty years ago, around the tenth year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, the French fleet harassed Fujian, and the Battle of Mawei was the most heartbreaking page in our country's history of shame. So every time I passed through, I couldn't help but sigh and pay tribute. I remember I once had two lines of poetry: "The flowing water should know the hatred of the fallen country, and the raging waves roar like the voice of a great lion." I wrote this while on the way to Mawei.</p>
<p>The terrain of Mawei is indeed very dangerous, so it is also one of the important military ports of our country. There are shipyards, docks, naval hospitals, naval schools, etc. there. Unfortunately, the ship passed by in a flash, and I didn't have the opportunity to visit them one by one.</p>
<p>After the ship anchored in Mawei, many people jumped up and asked if anyone wanted to hire a "kailongyang". At first, I was confused, but later I learned that "kailongyang" is a small gasoline boat, probably about seven or eight yuan per boat, and it takes about two hours to reach Nantai outside Fuzhou city.</p>
<p>Nantai was a trading port opened up during the Opium War when five ports were opened for trade, so it is the most lively place outside the city. The YMCA is also here, as well as many brothels and large hotels. The market is very prosperous. In front of Nantai is the Min River, with flowing water, never stopping day and night. There is a small island in the river, with a large bridge connecting the two. The south bridge is called Jiangnan, and the north bridge is called Wanshou, totaling 140 zhang in length. The engineering is very grand. The water under the bridge is very turbulent, especially when the tide rises, it is even more surging and powerful, like a thousand troops and ten thousand horses.</p>
<p>The streets of Fuzhou are well-built, the roads are also wide, and the municipal administration is pretty good. However, the rickshaws there are not well-constructed, and it is not comfortable to sit on. Fuzhou has a special kind of banyan tree. This kind of tree grows branches on the trunk, and roots grow out of the branches, hanging down to the ground, and then becoming trunks again. Therefore, its shade is very large. Its leaves are round and smooth. We can see them everywhere on the road. In summer, the dense shade blocks the sun and attracts wind. Banyan trees are very useful. Speaking of its origin, it is found in both Fujian and Guangdong, but Fuzhou is especially famous. So Fuzhou also has another name, called Banyan City. This is what my friend Mr. W told me.</p>

<h3>Second Annual Meeting of the Chinese Testing Society</h3>
<p>Held in Beijing Today</p>
<p>The second annual meeting of the Chinese Testing Society is scheduled to be held in the Zhizhi Hall of the Central University in the capital at 9:00 AM today. The history of the society, recent research work, and papers of this session are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Brief History  In the autumn of the 19th year, Dai Jitao, the president of the Examination Yuan, believed that the examination system was established by the late Dr. Sun Yat-sen and that testing was a method of the examination system. Therefore, he had the intention to initiate the organization of this society. At that time, the Central Party Headquarters had a testing section, which was headed by Mr. Wu Nanxuan. Mr. Wu, together with Mr. Shi Weihuan and Mr. Lai Lian, began preliminary preparations. The staff of the testing section drafted the organization and work plan, and a draft of the regulations. The first draft was completed on October 14, and initiators were solicited. By December 15, a total of 57 people agreed. According to the law, a statement of reasons was prepared and submitted to the Nanjing Special City Party Headquarters for permission to organize. On January 20 of the 20th year, permission to organize was granted and a permit was issued. Subsequently, a communication election was held using the named joint and several voting method. As a result, Wu Nanxuan, Ai Wei, Yi Kechun, Chen Heqin, Shi Weihuan, Gu Kebin, Zhuang Zexuan, Liao Maoru, and Yu Shuangqiu were elected as preparatory members. Chen Xuan, Shan Lu Zhiwei, Guo Yicen, Wang Shulin, and Peng Baichuan were elected as alternate preparatory members. Wu Nanxuan was designated to be responsible for convening preparatory meetings, establishing a preparatory committee, and electing Wu Nanxuan, Peng Baichuan, and Yi Kechun as executive committee members. Membership was also solicited. By June 21, the inaugural meeting and the first member meeting were held in the Zhizhi Hall of the Central University. The articles of association and work plan were approved, and Ai Wei, Yi Kechun, Heqin Gu Kebin, Peng Baichuan, Liao Shicheng, and Shi Weihuan were elected as directors. Wu Nanxuan, Wang Shulin, and Lu Zhiwei were elected as alternate directors. On July 17 of the 21st year, the first annual meeting was held at Yenching University in Beijing, lasting four days. A total of eleven papers were read, all of which were the results of the members' daily research. In August, the second board of directors was established, and No. 13 Langbei Street, Nanjing was rented as the address of the society. The members worked very hard at this time and did not slacken due to financial difficulties during the national crisis. Many books and instruments were also purchased at this time. This annual meeting was originally scheduled to be held during the summer of this year, but due to insufficient preparation, it was postponed to the present time. Prior to the meeting, the board of directors elected seven members of the annual meeting preparation committee, divided into four committees for papers, reception, document affairs, and separately prepared. Dai Jitao was appointed as honorary director, and Xiao Xiaorong and Wu Nanxuan were appointed as director and deputy director, respectively. Liu Naijing, Tong Runzhi, Huang Longxian, and Yi Kechun were responsible for the affairs of each committee. The preparation committee held four meetings. This is a rough outline of the evolution of the society since its establishment.</p>
<p>Research Work  The research work of this society is undertaken by each member independently. For research problems that are too large, the association will provide research subsidies. The results are either published in the association's magazine ("Testing") or printed into separate publications.

<h3>Amidst Calls for Independent Education Funding, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Henan, and Fujian Provinces Have Achieved Education Funding Independence</h3>
<p>But the government has no such proposition, making it even more difficult to raise funds</p>
<p>The twelve education personnel dispatched by the Ministry of Education to inspect various provinces and cities have returned to the Ministry one after another. Detailed reports on the inspections are being compiled separately by each member and will not be released within the year. We have interviewed various members to gather information on the total education funding and the status of education funding independence in the provinces and cities they visited (a total of twenty provinces and cities), which is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Jiangsu Province's education funding is completely independent, with the establishment of the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Office, which directly collects special education funds from various counties in Jiangsu. The actual expenditure for the current year for various provinces, schools, and provincial education institutions is approximately four million yuan per month, of which 3.8 million yuan comes from land tax and slaughter and tooth tax, and 200,000 yuan from school administrative income. (The budget originally listed 4.3 million yuan, but in reality, the item of school administrative income was canceled due to the provincial order not to collect tuition and accommodation fees, and the subsidy of 300,000 yuan from the finance department has not been paid in recent years. This year, due to the cancellation of tuition and accommodation fees, the finance department allocated two jiao per shi of transported grain collected to education, which translates to an actual revenue of approximately 200,000 yuan to offset the tuition and accommodation fees. Therefore, the so-called subsidy of 300,000 yuan from the finance department is even more difficult to pay, so only 4 million yuan is available.)</p>
<p>(2) Zhejiang Province's education funding has recently become independent. The provincial government has resolved to implement the special education funds and payment methods for Zhejiang Province. The total education funding for Zhejiang Province is over 2.106 million yuan, of which 1.2 million yuan comes from foil business tax, 200,000 yuan from tobacco and alcohol surtax, and 600,000 yuan from slaughter business tax.</p>
<p>(3) Nanjing City's education funding is in the planning and preparation stage for independence. The total education funding for the city (including various city schools and municipal education institutions under the social affairs bureau) is 600,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(4) Shanghai City's education funding is not yet independent. The total education funding for the city is over 1.22 million yuan.</p>
<p>(5) Anhui Province's education funding is not yet independent. The total education funding for the province is over 2.6 million yuan, of which 1.2 million yuan is subsidized by the central government, and the remainder is provided by the provincial treasury.</p>
<p>(6) Jiangxi Province's education funding is already independent, with a management committee overseeing its use. The Education Funding Management Office distributes the salt surtax received from the West Bank Tax Collection Bureau to various schools and provincial education institutions on a monthly basis. The total education funding for the province is 2 million yuan.</p>
<p>(7) Hunan Province is in the process of seeking education funding independence. According to Director Zhang of the provincial finance department in a conversation with Section Chief Wu of the Ministry of Education, 80,000 yuan can be allocated monthly starting from the next semester, and education funding can be independent. The total education funding for the province is 1.92 million yuan, with 108,000 yuan per month from the central salt surtax, and the remaining 52,000 yuan provided by the provincial treasury. The central government subsidy is not in arrears, but the provincial funds are currently received at 70% of the full amount, and it is feared that it will be 60% in the next semester. Therefore, education in Hunan Province is currently facing difficulties.</p>
<p>(8) Hubei Province is in the process of seeking education funding independence. The total education funding for the province is 2.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>(9) Guangdong Province's education funding does not have any problems in terms of the system, so there is no need for independence. The estimated education funding for the province is 3,210,821 yuan (excluding local education funding).</p>
<p>(10) Guangxi Province's education funding has never been in arrears and does not seek independence. The education funding for the province is 3,434,680 yuan (including local education funding).</p>
<p>(11) Henan Province's education funding is already independent, with the establishment of an Education Funding and Property Management Office. The education funding for the province is 2,375,192 yuan.</p>
<p>(12) Shaanxi Province's education funding is not yet independent in terms of revenue sources, with only a management office responsible for payment. The education funding for the province is 921,378 yuan.</p>
<p>(13) Fujian Province's education funding, according to the Ministry of Education inspector who returned from inspection last month, is already independent, with the establishment of an Education Funding Management Committee. The education funding for the province is 1,633,368 yuan, of which the central government allocates 110,000 yuan per month from the salt tax, and the remainder is provided by the provincial treasury. In addition, the local education funding belonging to various counties totals over 1.71 million yuan.</p>
<p>(14) Shanxi Province's education funding is not easy to become independent. The education funding for the province is over 1.9 million yuan.</p>
<p>(15) Suiyuan's education funding is also not easy to become independent, amounting to 280,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(16) Chahar's education funding is also difficult to become independent, amounting to 240,000 yuan.</p>
<p>(17) Shandong Province's education funding is not yet independent. The education funding for the province is 3,031,399 yuan, and the local education funding is 4,365,143 yuan.</p>
<p>(18) Qingdao City's education funding is not yet independent. The education funding for the city is approximately 530,000 yuan. (The reporter interviewed the current inspectors within half an hour, so the record for this city is approximate due to inaccurate information.)</p>
<p>(19) Hebei Province's education funding is not yet independent. The education funding for the province is 3.4 million yuan.</p>
<p>(20) Beiping City's education funding is not yet independent. The total education funding for the city is 960,000 yuan per year, or 80,000 yuan per month, of which 25,000 yuan per month is from the central government subsidy.</p>
<p>The Government's Attitude Towards Independent Education Funding: According to the Riri News Agency, since the outbreak of the September 18th Incident, due to the empty national treasury, the education funding of various provinces and cities has become even more strained, resulting in salary arrears for several months. In order to promote education administration and strive to rectify funding, the education authorities of various provinces and cities have generally advocated for independent funding. The Riri News Agency's Beijing correspondent specifically inquired about this matter with the person in charge of the Ministry of Education, who stated that since the 16th year of the Republic of China (1927), the country has been in continuous warfare, and the people are impoverished, resulting in the failure to allocate education funding on schedule, which is regrettable. Now, the provinces' request for independent funding seems justified, but implementation must have a corresponding income as fixed funding, otherwise it will still be a pie in the sky. Even collecting national taxes to cover national military and political expenses is not enough to make up for even a fraction of the needs, let alone allocating funds as fixed education funding. As for the education funding of Jiangsu and Fujian provinces, it was originally independent. Except for Fujian Province, which ultimately failed due to a certain matter, Jiangsu Province originally had the establishment of the Jiangsu Education Funding Management Committee, but recently the funds have also been misappropriated, resulting in arrears. Currently, all national universities, except for Tsinghua University, which has the Sino-American Boxer Indemnity as a foundation, are not independent. If they want to achieve it, the government still has no reserve funds. Considering the current difficulties, the Ministry believes that before education funding becomes independent, it should strive for the average allocation of all education funding.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Approves Exam Dates for Middle Schools in the Capital</h3>
<p>January 15th to 17th</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education, based on the Nanjing Municipal Social Affairs Bureau's report clarifying the measures for the upper semester graduation examinations for middle school students in the city in the 22nd year of the Republic of China (1933), made appropriate changes based on the Ministry's regulations and requested that points not yet stipulated be recorded and requested clarification of Article 10 of the regulations regarding the number of times a student can repeat a grade. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education instructed the bureau to explain each article as follows: (1) The city's middle school entrance examinations are approved to be postponed to January 15th to 17th. (2) The section on recruiting new students with the same academic ability as junior high school graduates in senior high school entrance examinations has already been clearly stipulated by the Ministry in the middle school regulations. Therefore, no additional regulations have been added in the entrance examination regulations. The bureau may issue certificates for students who fail one or two subjects in the junior high school entrance examinations to apply for further education. (3) The entrance examination pass certificate is originally intended for students to apply for further education. If the schools under the bureau can issue the graduated certificates that have been verified according to the time stipulated in Article 11 of the entrance examination regulations, the bureau does not need to issue this certificate separately. (4) Junior high school graduates who take vocational subjects in the entrance examination do not need to take foreign languages again. (5) Students who failed the natural science subject in the previous junior high school entrance examination should be allowed to retake the two subjects of physics, chemistry, and biology. Those who failed history or geography should be allowed to retake the failed part of the history and geography subject. (6) If a student cannot participate in the entrance examination due to illness or other reasons and requests a makeup exam afterwards, it should be decided by the city's Middle School Student Graduation Entrance Examination Committee whether to allow the makeup exam or only allow the makeup exam in the next entrance examination. (7) Article 64 of the Middle School Regulations states that "repeating a grade is limited to once," which refers to repeating a grade for one academic year. However, since many middle schools in various provinces and cities have classes that start in the spring, it is necessary to hold two entrance examinations. Students who fail three subjects in the entrance examination and repeat a grade can participate in the entrance examination twice. These students are nominally repeating a grade twice, but in fact, they are only repeating a grade for one academic year. The provisions of Article 10 of the entrance examination regulations are not inconsistent with the provisions of Article 64 of the Middle School Regulations. You should be informed of this. This order.</p>

<h3>The Affiliated Middle School of Jinan University Has Returned to Normal</h3>
<p>The two directors of education and training are temporarily replaced by Yuan Yeyu and Tang Tonghou</p>
<p>Yesterday, the senior high school continued to have classes, and the junior high school Boy Scouts held an inspection and camping event</p>
<p>According to Shanghai News, the students of the Affiliated Middle School of National Jinan University were dissatisfied with the director of the affiliated middle school, Kuang Songling, which led to a wave of expulsions of faculty and staff. The details have been reported in previous news. Yesterday, the school order was as usual, and the students attended classes with peace of mind. The junior high school Boy Scouts held an inspection and camping event. The details are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>School Situation: Yesterday, the entire affiliated middle school had returned to normal, and the students attended classes with peace of mind. Director Kuang did not come to school, and his duties were temporarily assumed by Principal Zheng. Dean of Academic Affairs Zhang Daoshen and Dean of Student Affairs Guan Kebui have also left the school. All Dean of Academic Affairs duties are temporarily assumed by teacher Yuan Yeyu, and the Student Affairs Director duties are temporarily assumed by full-time teacher Tang Tonghou. Most of the faculty and staff have returned to school to perform their duties.</p>
<p>Student Statement: Student representative He Guozhang of the school told the Shanghai News reporter yesterday, "The turmoil in our school this time was purely due to Director Kuang's lack of teaching and management skills. Since taking office, he has forced more than 100 overseas Chinese students to leave the school. The students have expressed their dissatisfaction, which has been brewing until now, leading to the outbreak. Now that Director Kuang has left, there should be no other problems. We are still attending classes as usual every day."</p>
<p>Boy Scout Inspection: Yesterday was the sixth anniversary of the establishment of the 64th Boy Scout Troop of the junior high school department. At the same time, the Rover Scouts and Boy Scouts of the university and senior high school departments resumed their activities. An inspection was held in the morning, and camping was held near the school in the afternoon. A bonfire was held in the evening, which was entirely organized by the students themselves. The order was quite good.</p>
<p>Statement from the Shanghai Alumni Association of Jinan University: Since the turmoil occurred in the Affiliated Middle School of National Jinan University, the Shanghai Alumni Association of Jinan University has repeatedly convened joint meetings of executive and supervisory committee members, and unanimously resolved to safeguard the alma mater, support Principal Zheng, and telegraph the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Education, and the school's trustees, etc., to quickly order the situation to be stopped in order to quell the turmoil. Although the turmoil in the affiliated middle school has eased, the association is still concerned that the students of the affiliated middle school may be used by others to create further incidents, so it has organized a special committee to deal with all contingencies. The association's express mail telegram to the Central Party Headquarters, the Ministry of Education, and the school's trustees, etc., is recorded as follows: (Omitted above) Extremely Urgent. Students in the middle school department of Jinan University suddenly went on strike at 9:00 AM on the 20th of this month (December), although it was very brief and classes were resumed immediately. However, the actions of the students in the middle school department were kept secret beforehand and strictly silent afterwards. Only at 9:00 AM on the morning of this day did a portion of the students in the middle school department order the faculty and staff of the middle school office to cease operations and teaching. At that time, because the incident happened suddenly, the school authorities were unable to stop it until 7:00 PM when the students automatically attended self-study classes. This morning, they arrived on time for classes and lectures. The course of events, from the outside, seems very mild and has come to an end. But in reality, it is not. According to a thorough investigation after the adjournment, the students in the middle school department have excessive demands on the school authorities. If this is the case, then although classes have resumed in name, it will be extremely difficult to deal with the aftermath. Currently, Principal Zheng can only concurrently serve as the director of the department to maintain the situation before Director Kuang returns to the school. However, at this time of instability and rumors, it is appropriate to use the sound of reading to capture the floating of society. My colleagues are deeply concerned about the current situation and are especially unwilling for more incidents to occur as the semester is about to end. Therefore, we earnestly request that your department (your leader) take appropriate measures to quickly deal with the situation and strictly order the students in the middle school department to restore the school's normal state, concentrate on their studies, and not make any further demands. If the school spirit is not rectified from the root, the victims will not only be Jinan University alone, and I am afraid that the students of various schools in Shanghai will unfortunately be drawn into the vortex and used by conspirators, and the impact is unimaginable. I am terrified and unable to express my expectations for orders and instructions. Respectfully, the Shanghai Alumni Association of National Jinan University.</p>

<h3>Jinan University Wins Soccer Championship, Retaining the Title</h3>
<p>Ties Fudan 1-1 Yesterday</p>
<p>—An Exceptionally Polite Game—</p>
<p>The Jiangnan University Sports Association Soccer Championship concluded yesterday, with Jinan University continuing its hegemony. Yesterday's match against Fudan was held at the China Baseball Field. Both sides played exceptionally politely, resulting in a 1-1 draw. A truly harmonious result.</p>
<p>No Scores in the First Half: But because of excessive politeness, the situation turned dull. In the first half, both sides went back and forth without scoring. If there were no opportunities, they would never force the ball when it reached the goal. It seemed that both sides had an agreement in advance not to infringe on each other. If all soccer games could be like this, then emotions would naturally be harmonious, and disputes would disappear.</p>
<p>Each Side Scores a Goal in the Second Half: About a quarter of an hour into the second half, Luo Haiguang of Jinan University scored a goal against Fudan, but in less than three minutes, Lu Xiuwen of Fudan returned a goal, resulting in a 1-1 draw. Jinan University thus won the championship with a record of five wins and one draw. The lineup and results of each team are as follows:</p>
<p>Jinan University</p>
<p>Ye Peichu, Gu Shang, Deng Hanjie, Wang Nanzhen</p>
<p>Lai Zuorong, Chen Zhenxiang, Yin Guiyi, Xu Yahui</p>

<h3>Fudan Star Absent Due to Injury, National Martial Arts School Basketball Team Wins</h3>
<p>—42-21—</p>
<p>Today Afternoon Game Against Jinan</p>
<p>Last night at 7:00 PM, the Nanjing National Martial Arts School basketball team and the Fudan University basketball team played a friendly match at the Fudan Gymnasium. The players of the National Martial Arts School are all strong athletes from the north, and their fighting skills are quite skilled. Fudan's strength is not inferior, but because Zhao Butian injured his foot and was unable to play, and Chen Zongqi was also absent due to illness, Fudan felt doubly strenuous in the game. In the first half, the National Martial Arts School took the lead with a score of 20 to 8. As a result, Fudan was defeated with a score of 42 to 21.</p>

<h3>Shen Huichun Incident of Being Beaten Up Has Been Entrusted to a Lawyer for Litigation</h3>
<p>To Uphold the Law and Manifest Human Rights</p>
<p>To Serve as a Warning to Others and Prevent Future Problems</p>
<p>Jiangnan University Suspends Jiaotong University from Competition for One Year</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Sports Referees Association held a temporary meeting on the 25th at Taihe Enclosure to discuss how to deal with the case of its member Shen Huichun being beaten by Jiaotong University students at the Jiaotong University stadium while officiating the Jiangnan University vs. Jiaotong University soccer game. At the same time, the Jiangnan University Sports Association also had five resolutions and informed the Referees Association by letter. The details are explored below.</p>
<p>Resorting to Law to Manifest Human Rights: When the Referees Association convened, all members were extremely indignant, believing that the Jiaotong University authorities had not given the offending students severe punishment, which was deeply regrettable. Since the school authorities had no solution, they had no choice but to resort to law to manifest human rights. Three members were immediately elected to form a special committee to take full responsibility for dealing with this extraordinary incident. The special committee has entrusted lawyer E Sen to handle the case. After discussing the matter with lawyer E for several days, it was decided to file a lawsuit in two parts, criminal and civil. The criminal part will directly sue the perpetrators, and the civil part will sue the president of Jiaotong University. As for who the perpetrators are, it is said that the association does not need Jiaotong University to hand them over, as they have already been witnessed by many people, and they will not be allowed to escape the law. Witnesses and material evidence are all ready. Furthermore, according to a spokesperson for the association, the association originally intended to settle the matter peacefully and did not want to expand the incident, but after waiting quietly for many days, they only heard the sound of "investigation" but did not see the reality of "punishment," so they felt that they could no longer tolerate it and were willing to make the greatest determination to seek the upholding of the law and can also use this to deal with and prevent future problems. In addition, the association felt that member Shen Guoquan could not prevent the incident from happening and was not responsible during the incident. After the incident, according to reports from many members of the association, he remained indifferent, without any spirit of seeing justice and acting bravely or helping each other in times of trouble. In view of Mr. Shen's two positions, they felt that he was not in line with the spirit of the association. Furthermore, they felt that Mr. Shen's letter to the Referees Association lacked the true spirit of sports. Although it was called an apology, it was mostly a defense, with the entire text mentioning nothing more than how Jinan University was stealing the ball and why the referee was beaten, as if Shen Huichun's beating was caused by the stealing of the ball. Although the words "apology" were uttered at the end, it was very reluctant. Carefully considering the meaning of the full text, it was no different from a statement of reasons for Shen Huichun's beating. The members of the association saw this situation and felt that he was no longer a comrade, so they also resolved to give him severe punishment. First, the association will send a letter to Mr. Shen, reporting the content of the resolution. If Mr. Shen believes that he is not satisfied within ten days after receiving the letter, he can be given the opportunity to respond, and then the special committee will review the matter. Otherwise, it will be executed upon expiration of the time limit.</p>
<p>Jiangnan University Sports Association Resolves on Five Items: After the unfortunate incident occurred, the Jiangnan University Sports Association also convened an executive meeting and resolved on five measures, and informed the China Sports Referees Association by letter: "Dear Sirs, Jiaotong University and Jinan University competed in the Jiangnan University soccer championship at the Jiaotong University stadium on the 16th of this month. Mr. Shen Huichun of your association was invited to officiate. Unfortunately, a dispute occurred at the end of the game. We convened an executive meeting on the 24th of this month (Sunday) and resolved on the following measures to resolve the matter: (1) A letter will be sent to Jiaotong University requesting reimbursement of medical expenses. (2) A letter will be sent to Jiaotong University to apologize to the Referees Association and Mr. Shen Huichun. (3) Jiaotong University will be suspended from participating in various competitions of the association for one year (from January 1, 1934). (4) A letter will be sent to the Jiaotong University authorities to severely punish the perpetrators. (5) A letter will be sent to the Referees Association to apologize and report the measures decided by the association. Furthermore, we intend to formulate permanent measures regarding the punishment of those who beat referees, but due to time constraints, we were unable to do so. We will make a final decision after the spring semester begins next year. This is specially reported to you, and we hope that your association will give us assistance in the future. Sincerely, the Jiangnan University Sports Association, December 26th."</p>
<h3>The Zhijiang Basketball Team Lost to Xiqing B Yesterday</h3>

<p>Last night, in addition to the Xiqing basketball team's B-team match, where Mingqiang defeated Yi Team 39-18, and the A-team match where Jinan defeated Nanxing 40-30, there was also a friendly match between the visiting Zhijiang Team and Xiqing's B-Team. The result was a 35-18 loss for Zhijiang.</p>
<h3>Mingqiang Defeats Yi Team</h3>
<p>The Mingqiang team had good coordination, and their forwards were also more active. Yi Team's guard, Ma Canfeng, was extremely brave, adding considerable strength to the entire team. At the start of the game, Yi Team took the lead, but Mingqiang soon caught up, at one point leading by as many as eleven points. The first half ended with Mingqiang winning 17-11. In the second half, Yi Team's shooting became increasingly chaotic, leading to a complete collapse. The final result was 39-18.</p>

<h3>Xiqing Defeats Zhijiang</h3>
<p>The Zhijiang team's teamwork seemed somewhat lacking, and their offense was often slow, resulting in few achievements. Although Xiqing's B-Team consisted of ordinary players, their offense and defense were consistent, and their forwards shot accurately. In the first half, after Zhijiang initially gained a slight advantage, they gradually lost ground, losing 13-6. In the second half, Zhijiang's play remained sluggish, and Xiqing did not put on any special performance. Under these circumstances, the game passed uneventfully, with the final result being 35-18.</p>

<h3>Jinan Defeats Nanxing</h3>
<p>In the last match, Jinan and Nanxing faced off. At the start, Nanxing had a slight advantage, but Jinan was unwilling to be outdone and pressed closely, resulting in three ties. Finally, Nanxing's Bao Xindi scored a free throw, taking the lead at 12-11. As the game continued, the situation was extremely balanced, with each team scoring alternately, resulting in frequent ties. Later, Jinan finally gained the upper hand as their lineup became more complete, and Nanxing committed frequent fouls, allowing Jinan to surge ahead. After several intense contests, Nanxing was once again pushing, but three players were fouled out in succession, leaving no replacements and only four players on the court, leading to despair. The final result was 40-30.</p>

<h3>Pucheng Leaves a Stain</h3>
<p>—Lost to Mailing Last Night—</p>
<p>Players Punch Referee</p>
<p>Write Letter of Repentance and Apology</p>
<p>The Korean Pucheng University basketball team played its final game in Shanghai last night against Mailing at the China Basketball Hall. Although Pucheng lost, their performance was better than in previous games, with Mailing winning 42-33. However, after the game ended, player number eight (this player never appeared in the game, so his name is unknown) punched referee Shu Hong for no reason. Shu was furious and demanded that the team hand over player number eight. The team was adamant and initially refused, but Association executives and Referee Association President Yue Xiurong, etc., believed this was a deliberate insult and insisted that player number eight be handed over. At that time, Shen Guoquan intervened and eventually handed over player number eight. Negotiations took place in the Association's writing room for a long time. Association leaders Shen Siliang and Shu Le decided on two possible solutions: player number eight must write a letter of repentance, one copy to be kept by the Association and one copy to be sent to the president of Pucheng University. If this solution was not accepted, then player number eight would be handed over to the police. The team initially refused both options. After more than an hour of negotiation, Shen Siliang drafted a letter of repentance and had player number eight sign it under the name "Rong Jin." However, it was found that there was no such name on the team, clearly indicating that he had changed his name to deceive. The team's spirit in the first three games was exhausted. Unexpectedly, this farewell game last night left a stain, which is truly despised. In recent weeks, large and small disputes have arisen in the sports world, truly a troublesome time.</p>

<p>(Beijing News) The Nanjing Lizhi Society's Zhongzheng Cup Football Tournament has held more than 30 round-robin matches. The scores of each team fluctuate, and they are currently competing fiercely. It is still unknown who will ultimately win the championship. A total of sixteen teams are participating in this competition, adopting a two-part single round-robin system.

<h3>Letter from Qixing Sports Association</h3>
<p>Dear Sir, I was greatly surprised to read in the sports news of the 27th in your newspaper, in the article "Guanglu Cup Small Football Championship, Yellow Black Wins Qiqiao A," the following passage: "Qiqiao A is a disguised version of the Qixing team, the Shanghai West Small Ball Competition champion." The small football team of our association has not participated in any competition this year other than the two championships held in Shanghai West and the Sports Ground. We hereby send a letter to clarify this. I hope you can publish it in the letter column. Sincerely, Wang Mingchuan, President of Qixing Sports Association, to the Sports Editor of Shen Bao.</p>

<p>Free Talk</p>
<h3>On Silence</h3>
<p>— Wu Xi</p>
<p>In 1924, Mr. Zhou Zuoren once used three sheets of paper to advocate "silence," but he was not opposed to "noise," but because of "helplessness," saying "this is the appropriate method for China now." Mr. Zhou finally used "three sheets of paper," which shows that "silence" is ultimately an impossible thing.</p>
<p>Mr. Du Heng said that in this era, only clever people are "silent," but clever people are very few after all.</p>
<p>"Silence" can only be achieved by great sages and great men. The world is full of talkative fools; that's what I think.</p>
<p>In fact, what kind of pain is there in "silence"? Concretely, I can't really say. Mr. Wang Tongzhao, in the preface to his poetry collection "This Era," said, "The more feelings one has, the less one can write, the emotions that cannot be sorted out, the dramatic movements of the era that are not easy to set off, so one is willing to be silent, and this is truly a kind of deep depression! I think being able to cry, being able to shout, being able to sing, laugh loudly, or even being able to say a few witty remarks, or even chaotic吵, one's depression can be relieved somewhat. This is like vomiting and excretion in severe cholera, even if the body feels empty, at least the spirit can get temporary comfort." I think this can be borrowed for explanation. The lack of promotion of the "silence" style, viewed from this, has a long history.</p>
<p>Here, I think of Mr. Lin Yutang's compromise on the matter, advocating "humor," which is not without reason.</p>
<h3>On Realistic Novels and the First-Person Writing Style</h3>
<p>— Mu Mutian</p>
<p>Now, our young people can no longer find comfort in the ivory tower. The environment turns their eyes to reality, making them pay attention to the suffering of the masses. In the field of literature and art, they want to realistically express the life of hunger and cold of the masses.</p>
<p>In recent days, while sick, I have superficially read some young people's novels. As a result, I feel this phenomenon more deeply. This realistic tendency is indeed a symbol of an era.</p>
<p>However, one thing makes me deeply dissatisfied: that is, some young writers, in their hearts, want to realistically depict society, but because they use the first-person writing style, they reduce the truthfulness of those novels.</p>
<p>Since the style of Chinese novels has not yet been truly established, it is naturally excusable that those young writers make this mistake. When encountering a lot of material, and at the same time not finding the best form to express this material, to properly装装, they blindly use the old form. And the first-person writing style commonly used by romanticists is also used by them. Is this first-person writing style suitable for modern realistic novels? It seems that no one has discussed this yet. This may prove that those young writers are still romantic to some extent.</p>
<p>However, this tendency must be corrected. This tendency will turn the living reality in the novel into a mechanical formula.</p>
<p>There are quite a lot of works with this tendency. Now, let's just take Ms. Cao Ming's "Tilted" (Literary and Art Period 2) as an example. Naturally, judging from that "Tilted," Ms. Cao Ming is a very promising young writer. However, precisely because her future is bright, her shortcomings need to be corrected even more. Naturally, judging from that "Tilted," Ms. Cao Ming wants to try her best to grasp reality. However, precisely because of that reason, it exposed even more that her first-person writing style is not suitable for the subject matter, and reduced the truthfulness of the work.</p>
<p>Great realistic writers, such as Stendhal, Balzac, Flaubert, Zola, etc., rarely or never used the first person in their works. That kind of first-person confessional technique cannot express the objective complex reality. If you compare the novels of Musset, George Sand, with the novels of Flaubert and Zola, you can know the similarities and differences.</p>
<p>Writing about workers and farmers in the first person is very difficult to make the article 丨丨that article is the character's confession丨丨suitable for the identity of the protagonist 丨丨confessor丨丨. For example, "Yang Ma's Diary," you can tell at a glance that it is fictional. Yang Ma's life can be objectively described. However, to ask Yang Ma to write that beautiful diary is comical. That is the author's conceptual fiction, not reality. Moreover, it is not easy for a protagonist to see all aspects of a story.</p>
<p>This kind of first-person writing style easily makes the author idealize his characters, and even idealize them excessively. For example, in "Tilted," the heroine is a maid, but the author wrote her as a poet: "In the three months I was idle, I constantly produced many hopes and beautiful illusions, but they all sank into the gloomy and verdant 魔窟-like seabed like ships hitting reefs in the sea," "Su Qi felt the lonely and poor sorrow of the desert island," and so on. Many of these words, I am afraid that not only a female worker cannot say or imagine, but even liberal arts students may not be able to say this kind of vivid and colorful words. This kind of beautification and idealization is harmful to the truthfulness of art.</p>
<p>Now, isn't there a kind of disharmony between form and content in many works? If so, it needs to be overcome urgently.</p>
<h3>Book Talk (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Junzhi</p>
<p>(V)</p>
<p>Therefore, book lovers not only love books, but also like to beautify their reading life, such as the location of the study mentioned in Mei Gong's words. Li Rihua, in "Miscellaneous Notes from the Purple Peach Pavilion," once had a design for a study, which read:</p>
<p>The study should be located in a winding place in the stream and mountains. The structure should be limited to three rooms, with an upper floor to view the clouds. A hundred bamboos should be planted on all sides to attract the clear wind. A pine tree should be planted on the south side to hang my moon. An old regret is slumped, with low branches entering the window; fragrant grass and moss cover the bottom of the steps. Taoist and Buddhist books should be placed in the east room, Confucian books in the west room. In the center, in addition to the horizontal table, famous calligraphy and paintings should be placed. White rice and fish soup should be served for breakfast and dinner, famous wines and fine teas. A strong man should guard the pavilion, rejecting worldly interactions. If this continues for ten years, Zhong Yao, Wang Xizhi, Gu Kaizhi, and Lu Tanwei will be unknowable, but they will certainly not be inferior to Yu Shinan, Chu Suiliang, Wang Wei, Hua Yuan, and others.</p>
<p>The fantasies of a book madman can be seen here. However, whether the results of "ten years like this" will achieve what he expects is a question, with a smile.</p>
<h3>"Reeds are green, white dew turns to frost"</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>丨丨Lecture at Shanghai Daxia University</p>
<p>"Reeds are green," a poem from Qin Feng. That is a love song. According to my speculation: When that man sent his lover back, the two walked along the river for a while, holding the long leaves of the reeds and standing facing each other for a while; the woman finally crossed the river, and they parted. After a long time, the woman never came back, maybe not even a single message. The man walked back and forth alone by the river, feeling restless in his heart; suddenly he saw the long leaves of the reeds, covered with a layer of frost; those long leaves pierced his heart, so he sang in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Reeds are green, white dew turns to frost.</p>
<p>The so-called beloved, is on the other side of the water;</p>
<p>Going upstream to follow her, the road is difficult and long;</p>
<p>Going downstream to follow her, she seems to be in the middle of the water!"</p>
<p>Suppose someone asked in a daze: "Why didn't the man cross the river to see his lover?" Maybe the woman's father was a moralistic gentleman who didn't allow them to love freely, not even to徘徊 outside the window, so he had to suffer from lovesickness by the river.</p>
<p>Falling in love, loving each other, missing each other, is a very ordinary and easily obtained experience for everyone, so writing love into poems occupies the most component in literary themes. Young men and women who are just entering the door of literature also prefer to read these kinds of themes, and there are many writers in Shanghai who make a living by writing these kinds of works. Since it is such a common and easily known theme for everyone, it should be very easy to write; why does this love poem by an unknown writer, "Reeds are green," let him walk alone through the ages? And why, three thousand years later, this lovesick patient's love song, when read after thousands of years, still "first gets my heart"? This is what I want to talk about today.</p>
<p>To open our heart bags in front of our lover, so that she understands our enthusiasm, is an extremely difficult task. Will you write thousands of words of love letters? Or hundreds of lines of poems? Maybe you will fail, completely fail. The best way to express love is not to write a word, not to say a word; silently the two lean on each other and walk on the grass, a crescent moon follows behind, honeysuckle sends a dark fragrance; at this time, each other's hearts are beating, cheeks are hot, eyelids are flowing, is there a more complete way to express it than this?</p>
<p>However, the expression of "not using a word, but naturally elegant" makes everyone feel unhappy; they must kneel on the ground and say: "I love you," or write on the stationery "I quietly belong to you," only then is it considered happy. Mr. Zhou Zuoren once said: "We somersault several times on the grass outside the door, imagining that the beauty on the high building is watching, which is very happy, is a method; anyway, she will not see it, so stop somersaulting, and lie on the grass to watch the clouds, this is also a method." Most of us ordinary people probably take the former method. (Those who do not somersault but 着 clouds are saints.)</p>
<p>Since you have to somersault to be happy, then the pattern of somersaulting appears. Poets express emotions, there are three patterns of赋比兴, this poem "Reeds are green" uses the pattern of "兴". The former people explained the meaning of "兴", saying that it is "borrowing things to evoke兴"; (Liu Eyun: "The text is exhausted but the meaning has餘, it is 兴," Li Yuyun: "Touching things to evoke feelings is called 兴, feelings are attached to things.") The long leaves of the reeds were originally unintentionally picked by each other at the time of farewell; when徘徊 by the river, these long leaves were the first stimulus to break into the mood, so he started writing from them, using them to express this emotion of lovesickness. For example, this round stool is too plain and unremarkable; but if my lover used to sit here often, but now she is dead, as soon as I see this round stool, I can't help but feel sad and shed tears, and mournfully chant: "Stool! Stool!" It seems that all the pain in my heart is entrusted to this plain and unremarkable round stool, and it seems that thousands of strands of pain must start from the round stool. Therefore, "Reeds are green, white dew turns to frost" and "The so-called beloved, is on the other side of the water" these two completely unrelated things, the poet connects them together, and we don't find it strange at all. (Zheng Yuzhong said: "The call of the osprey, is a temporary兴 for the poet, what he sees is here, and he feels it in his heart without planning it," which is what it means.)</p>
<h3>Two Brothers (73)</h3>
<p>— Authored by Maupassant, Translated by Li Weike</p>
<p>(8)</p>
<p>When Zhe'an returned to his own home, he collapsed onto a sofa. The sorrow and anxiety that made his brother imagine himself as a hunted beast, running and escaping, had a different effect on his lazy nature. It was as if his hands and arms were broken. He felt so weak that he couldn't move another inch, couldn't even go to bed. His body was as weak, tired, and bored as his soul. Unlike Bi'er, he was not struck by the purity of parental love, by the secret dignity that harbored a proud heart. Instead, he was overwhelmed by the blow of fate, which simultaneously threatened his most cherished interests.</p>
<p>When his soul finally calmed down, when his thoughts finally became clear again like water that had been stirred and then settled, he examined the situation that had been revealed to him. If he had heard the secret of his origins in a completely different way, he would have been angry and deeply saddened. But after arguing with his brother, after the violent and crude accusation that had shaken his nerves, his mother's sad confession left him with no strength to resist. The shock of compassion that was given to him was so severe that, under an irresistible emotion, he conquered all prejudices and all the sacred sensibilities of natural morality. Moreover, he was not a man of great resistance. He didn't like to fight with anyone, especially not with himself. So he let go, and driven by an instinctive tendency, by a natural love for peace, for a gentle and tranquil life, he immediately worried about the chaos that would occur around him and strike him at the same time. He foresaw that these upheavals were inevitable. In order to break these upheavals, he decided to meet them with superhuman efforts full of energy and activity. This difficult question must be resolved immediately, not tomorrow, because he sometimes had that strong need for immediate decision, a need that formed all the strength of those who cannot persevere. His lawyer's mind, accustomed to handling and studying complex situations and internal family problems that cause disputes, immediately discovered all the influences that were about to occur in his brother's soul condition. He involuntarily, almost from a professional point of view, considered the sequel to this matter, as if he were settling accounts with customers regarding future relationships after suffering a mental blow. Of course, continuing to have contact with Bi'er was impossible for him. It was very easy for him to avoid his brother by staying at home, but their mother could no longer live in the same house as her eldest son either.</p>
<p>So he lay motionless on the cushion, thinking for a long time. He thought of some plans and then abandoned them, without finding a satisfactory one.</p>
<p>But he was suddenly stimulated by a thought: Would a person who cherished his reputation keep the property he had received?</p>
<p>He initially answered, "No," and then decided to donate it to the poor. Although it was a very regrettable thing, he had no choice but to do it. He could sell his furniture, work like others, work like all newcomers. This majestic and painful decision spurred him on. He stood up and pressed his forehead against the glass window, looking outside. He originally had no money, and he was becoming moneyless again. In any case, he wouldn't starve. His eyes gazed at the gas lamp across the street. Just then, a woman returning home late walked by on the sidewalk, and he suddenly thought of Mrs. Lu Zuimi. He was deeply shaken by the cruel thought that arose. All the desperate effects that his decision would have appeared before him at the same time. He had to give up this woman, give up his happiness, give up everything. Could he do that? Now that he had promised to marry her? She had agreed to his proposal when she knew he was rich. Even if he had no money, she might still agree to him; but did he have the right to ask her, to force her to make this sacrifice? Wouldn't it be better to keep the property temporarily as a pledge, and then return it to the poor in the future?</p>

<h3>Though Financial Exchange Rates Fall, Silver Prices Rise</h3>
<p>Gold Price Drops Slightly by 3 Yuan 1</p>
<p>People's Hearts Seem Disoriented, Situation Mostly Hesitant</p>
<p>The gold market declined slightly yesterday. The market was stable throughout the day. People's hearts were disoriented. The situation was mostly fluctuating. The market is expected to remain weak. In the morning, overseas silver markets experienced a decrease in the UK and an increase in the US. The forward silver price on the Precious Metals Exchange rose by 4.5%. Exchange rates have begun to shrink. London raw gold rose by 1 penny. The US government's buying price for gold remained unchanged. US cotton rose by 16 points. US wheat rose by 2 points. Stocks rose by half a yuan. According to reports, the US Treasury Department initially announced government domestic silver purchase regulations. The quantity will be 10 million ounces more than the 24 million ounces stated in the President's proclamation. Although the opening gross price was called at 84.5 yuan, it fell due to strong selling pressure. This was because people's hearts were weak, and speculator Mr. Wu was selling heavily. After the opening, it was average. Then, as banks tended to pick up, the Hang Seng Bank's listing shrank by 125, reaching a high. However, due to people's uncertain hearts, banks took advantage of the high price to sell, causing a downstream trend. The market broke the 80 yuan mark, because Chinese merchants continued to sell, and the banks' appetite was not strong. It was reported that the US Bank had a rise of 100 points in the night market. The market turned weak. Banks took advantage of the low price to continue picking up, hedging activities occurred, and Guangdong merchants picked up silver bars, causing the price to rise to over 80 yuan, and finally fluctuated. Although Reuters reported activity in Canadian silver mines in the morning, causing a slight drop, London financiers expressed doubts about the US President's silver policy, which stabilized the price. In reality, there was a lack of deep influence. The break-even price was 1,065 yuan. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 682.3 yuan, a decrease of 2 yuan compared to the previous closing. The object price opened at 2.5 yuan. The exchange market opened with recent selling prices of British exchange at 1 shilling 3 pence 875 and US exchange at 33.9375 yuan. Da Decheng and Hui Xiang sold silver bars, causing the price to drop to 1.5 yuan. Hengyu and Yuanmao Yong retreated. Macquarie picked up April at 35 yuan. Although Hengxing sold, it still rose to around 4 yuan. It was expected that HSBC's listing would remain unchanged. Hengxing, Hengchang, Yongyuan, Chun Zhaofeng, Chang, etc. had entries and exits from time to time. At this time, there was a lot of struggle. After entering, it was learned that HSBC's listing was flat for British exchange and a decrease of 115 for US exchange. Fuyu, Zhaofengchang, Hengyu, Hengxing, etc. picked up silver bars. Citibank and Macquarie took in April US dollars at 9375, causing the price to rise to 4 yuan 40 cents. HSBC sold March US dollars at 625. Hengyu, Fuchang, Zhifeng, Yongda Decheng, etc. sold silver bars, causing the price to drop to 1 yuan 70 cents. Hengxing took advantage of the low price to buy, temporarily improving. However, because the internal market was loose and overflowing, Zhengjin sold March US dollars at 6875. Soon, there were no buyers for April US dollars at 0625. Yuanchun, Fuyu, Yuanmao Yong, etc. sold at 010 cents. Hengxing, etc. still bought. The internal market was also average, gradually rising to 1 yuan 90 cents. Objects came to supply repeatedly, and the situation still declined. The noon closing was 681.2 yuan, and the object price was 1.2 yuan.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 681.7 yuan, and the object price opened at 1.2 yuan. Da Xing, Yongyuan Sheng, Yongyuan Chun, Hengxing, Yongfeng, etc. all sold, and gradually retreated from 1 yuan 80 cents, breaking the 80 yuan mark. Zhengjin picked up April US dollars at 125. Zhaofengchang, Dalian Gang, Hengxing, etc. bought. However, because Qianchangxiang Daxing Yong sold again, the price dropped to 78 yuan 20 cents. Huabi and Macquarie jointly picked up April US dollars at 125. Hengxing, Yifeng Yong took advantage of the low price to buy silver bars, stabilizing the price. Retail investors strongly supplied, causing the price to rise again to 80 yuan 05 cents. Huixiang sold hard, causing the price to retreat to 79 yuan 20 cents. Zhengjin ate April US dollars at 125. North Korea took in the same month at 0625. Hengxing and Dadecheng entered the market to pick up silver bars, causing the price to rise to 81 yuan 60 cents. After fluctuating, the closing price was 681.2 yuan, and the object price was 0.8 yuan, slightly decreasing. The highest price during the day was 684.4 yuan, and the lowest price was 678.2 yuan, a difference of 6.2 yuan. As a result, it decreased by 3 yuan 10 cents compared to the previous closing.</p>
<p>The quoted price was 721 yuan due to HSBC Bank's US exchange rate shrinking by 125 to 33.25 yuan. According to the closing price, about 40 yuan was squeezed, 5 yuan more than the previous closing. The registration price for this month was 696 yuan. The registration price for January was 690 yuan. The registration price for February was 681 yuan. The morning make-up water was 696 yuan. The afternoon make-up water was 696 yuan. The break-even price was 1,065 yuan. Tianjin merchants still had a strong intention to sell, and the central government's appetite was also strong. The official transaction price ranged from 1,062 yuan to 63 yuan. Tianjin merchants sold about 4,000 taels to Yingfeng Henggong. There are currently 4,368 silver bars for this month and 1,842 silver bars for January.</p>
<p>The in-market transaction was quite active. In total, Hengxing, Yifeng Yong, Zhaofengchang, Fuyu, Hengchang, Yongyichengsen, Changyong, Yongfeng Hengxingyuan, Wanxing, etc. were on the buying side. Huixiang Yuanmao, Yongdachangxiang, Bingxingchang, Shengyongdadecheng, Xianghefutai, Hengyuanshengyong, Shunli, etc. were on the selling side. Hengyu, Zhifeng Yong, Qianchangxiang, Daxing Yong, etc. advanced first and then exited. Hengtaiyuanmao, Dafayong Yuanchun, etc. exited first and then entered. Dalian Gang Shunli made a total of more than 2,100 silver bars, squeezing out about 100 silver bars. Wanxing made a total of more than 1,400 silver bars, squeezing in more than 500 silver bars. Guangdong Gang Hengxing entered about 1,500 silver bars and exited more than 400 silver bars. In total, there were 37,170 chips for February.</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchants Sold 600,000 US Dollars</h3>

<h3>Overview of the Daily Necessities Market (2)</h3>
<p>(Xinan)</p>
<p>Vegetarian food has recently become popular, following the trend of believing in Buddhism. Vegetarian restaurants can be found in places like Chenghuang Temple, Daxin Street, Dongxin Bridge, and the vicinity of Sanma Road. However, the more exquisite vegetarian restaurants are undoubtedly Gongdelin and Jue Lin. Gongdelin was originally on Beijing Road, but since the houses there were converted into the Lake Society, it moved to Park Road. Jue Lin was originally on Wangping Street, but since that area became the center of the news industry, it also moved to the intersection of Xihui Road and Songshan Road. Eating vegetarian food, in terms of learning Buddhism, is of course to refrain from killing, so as to avoid the cycle of cause and effect and repeated reincarnation. However, like the Western advocacy of animal protection, the result must also lead to vegetarian food. Otherwise, if you only advocate protection verbally, and do not hesitate to slaughter animals to satisfy your appetite, how can this be the way to protect animals? Therefore, if you want to thoroughly protect animals, you must be vegetarian. For the time being, let's put aside refraining from killing and protecting animals. Even from the perspective of personal hygiene, it is better to eat more vegetarian food. Fish is easy to spoil, and meat is easy to spoil, so more people eat vegetarian food in the summer, which is precisely the reason. Ancient people strongly advised against eating foods that were smoked, roasted, or burned, saying that they could damage the stomach and intestines and easily cause carbuncles and boils. These words were not researched from science, but crystallized from experience, so of course they have some truth. However, some people say that foreigners eat a lot of smoked and roasted food, but they are not often seen suffering from carbuncles and boils. Does this mean that the words of the ancients are not credible? I am not a foreigner, so I have no way of knowing the situation in the abdomens of foreigners, but from my own experience and observations, I deeply feel that the words of the ancients are still not obsolete. Why is this? If we eat a lot of meat, we always feel uncomfortable in our abdomen, unless we have a strong stomach and intestines, but eventually we will get sick. What is the reason for this? Because this kind of food is not easy to digest and accumulates in the stomach and intestines, it will naturally produce toxins that enter the blood and spread throughout the body, which is called autotoxicity. If you don't get internal diseases, you will suffer from external symptoms. You see, foreigners often take laxatives and intestinal lubricants, and they must eat fruit after every meal, precisely to use the power of medicines and fruits to clear stagnation, but this is not a fundamental solution. Because the power of the medicine will cause inertia over time, and the natural ability to digest will weaken; fruit is not entirely suitable to be eaten with meals. In our country, there is a prohibition against eating fruit after meals, believing that sudden heat and sudden cold are not suitable. This shows the difference in preferences between the East and the West. It also shows that our country's diet, which emphasizes grains and vegetables and slightly includes meat, is the most hygienic method, which the West cannot match. First, various nutrients can be blended and absorbed comprehensively; second, most of the vegetarian food is plants, which are rich in chlorophyll and have the natural function of lubricating and unblocking the intestines. If you don't believe it, you can try it. If you eat vegetarian food once or twice after eating meat for a long time, the effect will be immediate. Therefore, vegetarian food does occupy an important position in hygiene. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Large Securities and Government Bond Investors Still Buying</h3>
<p>—Market Sentiment Remains Strong—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange remained very strong. Large investors were still buying. The reduction of troops was the most needed, and the increase in market price was also the most intense, rising by 70 cents throughout the day. However, the same government bonds, such as Jin Duan, fell by 60 cents. The difference between high and low was 1.5 yuan. The surface seemed unfair, but the total amount of Jin Duan was 80 million, with only a few missing. The total amount of troop reductions was only more than 30 million, and the lack of chips was an undeniable fact. Moreover, there was still a surplus of 10 million from the reduction of troops in January. If the situation was slightly better, the short squeeze would be particularly severe. In the morning opening, the prices of most stocks from the previous day were too high, and the bulls released them slightly. The market price, except for the compilation and deployment, rose slightly by 20 to 30 cents, and the rest uniformly returned by 30 to 40 cents to 1.2 yuan. In the second session, retail investors were still selling the previous types, but No. 4 and No. 16 were still buying. Although the price continued to weaken by 30 to 40 cents, since 1920, due to the strong needs of large investors, the market turned upward again, improving by 30 to 50 cents. In the afternoon opening, No. 4, No. 16, and No. 33 were all in demand, and the troop reductions returned by as much as 90 cents. The rest also improved by 30 to 60 cents. The trend was still very strong. Before the closing, the previous types continued to rise by 20 to 30 cents. Unified salt tax and unified tax fell by 10 to 20 cents because No. 54 had a lot of selling. Jin Duan Zheng Liu was slightly weak. As a result, the market price completely diverged between the front and back. The front, from the compilation and deployment to the 1920 Guan, rose by 30 to 90 cents. The 1918 Guan rose by 1.3 yuan because it had not been traded for many days. The unified tax had no changes. From the salt tax onwards, they all fell, by 20 to 60 cents. In this situation, it was heard that large investors sold unified salt tax and Jin Duan Zheng Liu and exchanged them for troop reductions. The total transaction volume was 18.31 million yuan. There were no spot transactions. The total number of salt tax futures was 5.88 million yuan. Troop reductions accounted for 4.675 million yuan. 1919 Guan Shan accounted for a total of 1.745 million yuan. 1920 Guan Twenty Guan accounted for a total of 2.635 million yuan. Jin Duan Zheng Liu accounted for a total of 2.07 million yuan. The rest ranged from tens of thousands to more than 800,000. The market will be closed today to handle the delivery of December futures.</p>
<h3>New York Stock Market Transaction is Very Active</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Firm reported on the 27th that the New York stock market was firm, and the transaction was as smooth as it has not been since August. The selling party had no pressure, and the price of Baisu rose. At the same time, commercial news was also very good, including the increase in railway profits. Cotton, silver, leather, copper, rubber, and raw silk rose slightly. Bonds remained strong. The full-day turnover was 3.08 million shares. According to the Iron and Steel Century report, the amount of steel work is now 37%. It did not decrease due to the Christmas holiday. Steel exports in mid-December will exceed November, October and December of last year. Only when approaching the end of the year, it may shrink to 34% to 35%. In the first quarter of the following year, the automotive industry, public construction, and railways were predicted to have strong needs. Therefore, the situation is unusually optimistic. (Wheat) Speculators turned from short to long and rose. The climate in the Northwest is cold, which is good for the long side. (Cotton) More and more people have a smooth concept of the cotton field reduction plan. At the same time, it is also expected that the US dollar will continue to depreciate, so the market is firm. The price of gold purchased by the Financial Reconstruction Agency was 34.06 yuan per tael, unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Grain: River Rice Market Dull, Sales Stagnant</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the supply showed a slight increase, with over 50 boats (over 7,000 shi) arriving at various wharves. Due to the approaching Lunar New Year, finance and shipping companies declared a suspension of business, including rice dealers, grain shops, and upper-level wholesalers. Consequently, only small-scale transactions occurred, resulting in a very quiet market situation. The market presented a stagnant picture. It is heard that the Shanghai market will be closed for two days during the Lunar New Year, leaving little hope for any turnaround in the coming days. The market for thick japonica and Duyang pointed rice remained similar to before, with prices unchanged. Yinbian rice also remained stable.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Over 40 boats arrived. Sales of various types of rice remained sluggish. White japonica, white yuan, Yangdu, Bujiang, and Xian rice remained firm. Early thin rice and Yin yuan remained stable.</p>
<h3>Customer Xian Rice: Supply and Sales Both Slow</h3>
<p>—Ningbo Merchants Inquire Slightly—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the customer Xian rice market experienced minimal arrivals and sluggish sales. Local rice dealers rarely inquired about customer Xian rice. Dealers from Fujian province uniformly suspended operations, and those from the north made no purchases. However, Ningbo merchants took the opportunity to make small purchases, including 120 bags of Jiangxi machine-processed late rice at 7.30 yuan and 100 bags of Hunan machine-pressed oil rice at 7.15 yuan. There were no other transactions. The market price was similar to the previous day. As the recent market price had already reached the bottom, and supplies were scarce, cargo owners were unwilling to sell at lower prices.</p>
<h3>8,000 Bags of Future Flour Delivered This Month</h3>
<p>Yesterday, futures flour trading was suspended for delivery. There were no transactions for either futures or spot flour. The delivery of this month’s futures flour has been fully completed, with a total of 8,000 bags delivered to the warehouse, including 7,000 bags of Maigen flour and 1,000 bags of Xiangxin flour. All were warehouse warrants recovered by northern merchants and hoarders.</p>
<h3>Lower-Grade Yellow Beans Rise by Two or Three Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the yellow bean market was stable. Upper and middle-grade beans remained ostensibly stable but subtly weakened. However, there was slightly more activity in the purchase of lower-grade beans by factories, causing the market to rise by two or three cents. A total of six or seven cars of various beans were traded. Inland merchants purchased one car. Local trading amounted to three or four cars. Merchants from Xiamen inquired about 100-200 bags for export, including three cars of Zhengyangguan beans priced at 3.50-3.44 yuan, two cars of Guide beans priced at 3.45 yuan, and three cars of Yingzhou beans priced at 3.35-3.26 yuan. Three cars of Suixikou beans were priced at 3.30-3.27 yuan, and four cars of Bengbu beans were priced at 3.23-3.17 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Domestic Green Sugar Opening Prices Continue to Ease</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market still showed no sign of improvement. The Sugar Association quoted 24 for raw coarse white sugar at 19.50 yuan, down another 0.1 jiao. Re-exported goods were quoted at 6.75 yuan, at the original price, but without transactions, and further declines were expected. No. 20 medium coarse white sugar had no transactions, quoted at around 19.4 yuan. Nos. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar were quoted at 15.7 yuan, unchanged. Taikoo sugar remained stable, with B mark at 20.15 yuan and CW mark at 20 yuan. Zhenji cotton white was quoted at the original price, with No. 1 at 18.55 yuan, and the rest discounted. The opening price of sliced green sugar also decreased. Over 200 boxes were traded yesterday, priced at 9.6 yuan, down 0.4 yuan from before. Over 100 pieces of Chaozhou green sugar were also offered, slightly down about 0.1 yuan, at 13.3-12.7 yuan. Another 280 pieces of new Diao green sugar arrived and were still being declared, and it is expected they can be cleared and offered tomorrow, with the possibility of further easing prices.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: Xingquan Longan Water Freight Increases</h3>
<p>Cost Pressure Will Increase Accordingly</p>
<p>Xinghua Quanchuan longan has seen no continuous arrivals due to transport difficulties since the Fujian unrest. A certain company has chartered a foreign ship named "Shenyou," which has sailed to Xingquan to load longan. According to yesterday's telegram, it will be transported down soon, but the water freight has increased by 50% compared to before, thus increasing the cost. There is hope for improvement in the market later on.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: Only Sporadic Sales of Woolen Fabrics</h3>
<p>As the end of the year approaches, all industries are looking to finalize their accounts. Woolen fabric trading is therefore quiet. Yesterday, the market at the guild was sluggish, and prices were chaotic. Transactions were mostly sporadic. Western-style suits, including fancy woolens, overcoat woolens, plain thick woolens, Melton cloth, and riding breeches woolens, saw relatively more active trading. Felt and shoe factories showed strong purchasing power, but only for sporadic amounts. Prices failed to rise due to the current period. There were still sporadic purchases of domestic wide and narrow camel hair at 1.6 yuan, and also some transactions of artistic plain camel hair at over 2 yuan.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Overseas Silk News Still Unchanged Yesterday</h3>
<p>New York White Filature Has Prices But No Market. The New York raw silk market has recently seen active selling of silk holdings by general importers due to the approaching year-end and fears of global economic panic. Furthermore, excessive dumping of Japanese silk has led to no inquiries for Chinese silk. According to news from local American silk merchants such as Qianli, the current inventory of Chinese silk in New York reaches 3,700-3,800 bales. Grade B white filature is quoted at a strong US$1.4 per pound for a 83% evenness, which is 8-9 cents higher than the standard Japanese silk price. Converted to Chinese currency, the price per bale is only around 500 yuan, but there is still price but no market.</p>
<p>Douppion Silk Sales Not Quiet. Douppion silk sales have not been quiet recently. Although local single cocoon silk factories have all suspended operations, the Fulun Douppion Silk Factory is still working. Last week, the British mail steamer transported 40 bales of douppion silk for export to England for transshipment to India.</p>
<p>Rayon Inventory in Shanghai: 3,000 Cases. Imports of European and American rayon have not been smooth recently, and the inventory in Shanghai is sparse. According to checks, the total inventory of various sales agents is only about 3,000 cases, all stored in customs warehouses in Pudong due to tax payment issues. As for current spot sales, due to the approaching year-end and tight credit, various merchants have temporarily suspended purchasing, and the market is quiet.</p>
<p>Yellow and White Filature Silk Sales Desolate. The Christmas holiday has just passed, and overseas silk news remained unchanged yesterday. Yokohama Japanese silk prices were expected to rise. Although various European and American firms in Shanghai sent out filature telegrams yesterday morning, the prices demanded by various manufacturers were too high, making it difficult to extend the contract period. The market remained quiet. Only eight bales of yellow and white filature silk were purchased by inland silk shops yesterday, and prices remained weak.</p>
<h3>Needle and Xiu Mei Teas See Slight Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the foreign merchants’ tea market, English firms such as Tongfu and Yihuo slightly increased their purchases of domestic Needle, Xiu Mei, and other green teas to replenish their stocks. A total of 75 cases were negotiated city-wide, sold for 32 yuan, a decrease of 2-3 yuan compared to before. There were still no inquiries for Zhen Mei and Pearl Tea. Due to poor sales to foreign merchants, domestic factories have been suspending operations one after another, and the market situation is desolate.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Human Inertia</h3>
<p>— Wei Ba</p>
<p>Walking on the street, I heard vendors shouting about selling both the old lunar calendar and the new solar calendar. This couldn't help but evoke a feeling: humans are truly creatures of inertia.</p>
<p>The purpose of a calendar is originally to verify the dates between each other, but it is taken for its universality, regardless of national boundaries. So, since there is already a solar calendar, for the sake of convenience, there is no need to preserve that ancient and unpopular "lunar calendar" and be complacent about it. However, some people would rather abandon "convenience" and choose "inconvenience." What reason can explain this? Other than saying it is due to the inherent inertia of humans.</p>
<p>Human inertia is not limited to this. Apart from the old conservatives who keep their braids and inscribe "Spring King First Month," what is seen in daily life in society, such as weddings, still uses large red sedan chairs, drums, and music, parading down the street, preserving the relics of ancient predatory marriages. During funerals, many children wear ancient robes and gowns (also used at weddings), carrying hard plaques with inscriptions such as "Imperial Grant" and "Qing Gift." Funeral notices still have inscriptions like "Qing Feng XX." Resuming the reading of classics. Abandoning the universal vernacular Chinese and writing ancient and elegant essays in the style of the Tang and Song Dynasties. Recreating a republic, but then thinking of autocracy, etc., are all examples.</p>
<p>Human attachment to the past proves his weak creativity. The solution to problems lies in progress and creation, not in recollection and restoration. Humans can only find liberation in constant progress; recollection and attachment do not help the reality.</p>
<p>For example, if there is no food to eat, we can think of ways to make sure there is food to eat; if there are no clothes to wear, we can think of ways to make sure there are clothes to wear; if there is no work to do, we can think of ways to make sure there is work to do; all problems, except if you yourself do not want to solve them, are not entirely without solutions. But humans are content with simplicity, content with poverty, content with hunger and cold, allowing themselves to be dominated by one or two ambitious people, and then cannot help but shout "poor," shout "suffering," and cry to heaven. Abandoning one's own efforts and blaming society for not conforming to oneself, how can this be justified?</p>
<p>Ah, humans are originally so accustomed to laziness!</p>
<h3>Modern Literati</h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu Xiang, a poet with a high status in the new literary world, recently committed suicide by drowning. In this day and age, death is not a big deal, let alone the death of a literati who has nothing to do with wealth, power, and influence! So, I imagine that the death of Mr. Zhu Xiang, apart from evoking some sighs and sympathy among a few intellectuals who have a deep and melancholy experience of the meaning of life, will not bring tears of sympathy from those who wear light fur coats and warm belts and are at the height of their careers to "waste" on this unfortunate poet.</p>
<p>Because the death of the poet Zhu Xiang reminded me of the novelist Gu Zhongqi, who committed suicide three years ago, and the writer Peng Jiahhuang, who died of poverty and illness not long ago. The deaths of these three people have the difference between suicide and death from illness, but the sad plight of being strangled by the real society, haggard and exhausted, and dying with their aspirations unfulfilled is the same.</p>
<p>Using the clichéd phrase "literati are ill-fated" to mourn the defeated in the above-mentioned journeys of life is the most empty and vulgar thing to do. Originally, from ancient times to the present, among literati or poets, the lucky ones are few and the unfortunate ones are many; for the sake of convenience in speaking, it is not impossible to encompass and generalize it with the word "fate." But at the same time, it must be recognized that the "fate" or "ill-fate" of literati is not determined by heaven, but in reality is determined by people: half is determined by the preferences and needs of emperors, nobles, the rich, important people, and celebrities, and half is determined by the literati's own self-treatment. The great poet Li Bai also had a time when he was drunk in Chang'an and looked down upon the ministers, but it was not because he was "born under a lucky star" at that time, but because it happened to be a time of peace and prosperity, when drums of war were not sounding, and in the banquet atmosphere of kings and noble concubines, a poet like Li Bai, who was unadorned and naturally magnificent, was needed to embellish the occasion. However, Li Bai later could not avoid falling into obscurity and dying in decline; because he finally grew a few stubborn and proud bones, and in the eyes of the court and palace, he could not become a permanently pleasing decoration. In addition, among the literati of all dynasties, there were countless who were demoted, exiled, killed, or impoverished, while those who had good luck or "fate" were indeed very few.</p>
<p>In modern times, although the lifestyle of human beings has reached the ultimate in sound, light, electricity, and wondrous changes, the fact that literati or poets must find a way to "ascend the dragon gate" from the principle of "cooperating with the spiritual needs of the social ruling exhibition" has not changed slightly because of the "revolutions" that have been carried out more than once. This society, of course, still needs literati, but what it needs is definitely not poets like Zhu Xiang who faithfully sing the praises of nature or life, and express their artistic conception from their own perspective, but two other kinds: one is "skilled people" or "craftsmen" who are good at writing, who can write circular telegrams, eight-line poems, quatrains, couplets, and all kinds of social writings for people like "important people," "great men," and "celebrities," such as Rao Hanxiang, a specialist in four-six essay telegrams, and Bai Jianwu, who specializes in writing anti-Anfu clique and anti-Japanese traitorous telegrams. The other is a poet who is good at throwing out certain well-placed flattering words, such as Zheng Sujian, who is good at praising the saints, and the old man Fan Shan, who offered "General Zhang's Song of Pacifying Soldiers" two years before the "September 18th Incident" and thus received a reward of ten thousand gold. However, the kind of new poems written by the poet Zhu Xiang, with their light and ethereal artistic conception and light brushstrokes, are completely different from the literary and artistic style needed by the upper echelons of today. They can only be spoken to those who know, and cannot be spoken to "important people." They cannot be used as a "thunderous" manifesto, nor can they be used as a whitewash for peace. At the same time, they cannot be devalued to two yuan per thousand words to create wealth for booksellers and capitalists. Then, apart from being ignored by society and coldly treated by the general public, what "way out" has this cold society left for poets! Therefore, the poet's exhaustion, the poet's disillusionment, and even the poet's suicide are almost a predetermined conclusion of the facts.</p>
<p>Living in such a chaotic year and country, the way out for literati is originally like "a rat digging into a bull's horn, the more it digs, the tighter it gets." Looking forward and backward, recognizing the reality, there are only three ways out: one is to stand on the opposite side of the old social forces, racking one's brains to shout out for the oppressed and the circumstances of their struggles and resistance; the second is to stick to the tail of the old social forces and climb hard, reading those "Records of Mourning for Zeng and Zuo" and "What will happen to the people if my lord does not come out?" "Knocking bricks" or nauseating songs until they are memorized, relying on one's own writing and face to serve all the "raw and cooked Wei" powerful people. The third is to recognize one's own frustration as "the matter of course," neither advocating "contentment with poverty" nor seriously "hating life," and temporarily living a muddled life.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the poet Zhu Xiang actually took the third path but could not extinguish his own wisdom. As a result, he became "without a way out." He finally could not overcome reality and committed suicide!</p>
<p>Expressing infinite condolences to Mr. Zhu Xiang, and at the same time hoping that if there are any frustrated writers among those who read my article, they will also be moved in their hearts and examine the path they have taken!</p>
<h3>Gone Mad</h3>
<p>— Shi Nong</p>
<p>"Zhang A'hu, I won't let you farm my land next year!" the landlord said sternly. Two eyes stared at a middle-aged farmer.</p>
<p>"Landlord... really..." The middle-aged farmer called Zhang A'hu pleaded in tears. "Really, God doesn't have eyes, my eldest son was taken away to be a soldier, and his life or death is unknown, my second son is sick... the harvest this year is bad, and the price of rice is cheap. I farmed twelve mu of land in total, and the rice I sold is not enough to pay back the money, the pancake money, redeem the pawn, and buy medicine. Now I barely managed to put together these few yuan, let me pay back some of the old debts! If I owe this until next year, I will definitely pay you back in the spring, let me still farm the land next year. Landlord, please have mercy on my whole family, I have been a tenant for more than ten years, and I have never owed you before when the harvest was good... Landlord... Landlord..."</p>
<p>"Don't be so long-winded!" The landlord became impatient. "I have already asked Peng A'hu to farm the land next year!" Saying that, he walked inside.</p>
<p>Zhang A'hu walked out of the landlord Li Squire's lacquered gate painfully in tears.</p>
<p>"Mom, it hurts! It hurts!" The sick child moaned in pain in the dark bed.</p>
<p>The peasant woman frowned and comforted her only remaining son A'Niu while crying.</p>
<p>"Good son, be quiet, it's okay, wait a while, your father will come back with the medicine, and you will be better after you take it."</p>
<p>"It hurts, it hurts!" The child still cried and moaned.</p>
<p>The peasant woman went to open the door painfully, waiting for her husband to come back.</p>
<p>The sky slowly darkened, and the child's crying gradually subsided. A black figure walked from afar, staggering. The peasant woman hurried over.</p>
<p>"A'Niu's dad! What happened?"</p>
<p>"Damn it! That landlord... hateful... the land for next year has been given to Peng A'hu to farm... damn it, that guy!..."</p>
<p>"You drank alcohol again, didn't you?"</p>
<p>"To hell with it! I'll drink two catties for nothing, and then we'll talk! To hell with it!... That landlord... that Peng A'hu thief... damn it!..."</p>
<p>"A'Niu's dad, what about the medicine?" The peasant woman asked him about the important matter.</p>
<p>"All the money was spent on alcohol!"</p>
<p>"You damn killer! You don't care that your son is so sick, you only know how to drink alcohol, I'll fight you to the death!" The peasant woman cried and pounced.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhang A'hu opened his eyes wide, clenched his fists, and punched his wife's forehead, saying in his mouth:</p>
<p>"You son of a bitch: You're good! ... I'll kill you, Peng A'hu!"</p>
<p>The peasant woman was so frightened that she ran into the door. Zhang A'hu also jumped in.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Inside the door, the child's voice was calling "It hurts, it hurts!"</p>
<p>A week later, the whole village knew that Zhang A'hu had gone mad. There was one more small coffin in Tian Hengtou. (The End)</p>
<h3>Wife</h3>
<p>— Hao Qiu</p>
<p>Since I raised the banner of "rebellion," I have suffered the family's cruel "encirclement and suppression." Fortunately, I have received the sympathy and support of my sober-minded younger siblings, and I have broken through the extremely hot fire fight. However, at this time, I already have a nominal wife left at home, and because of the continued expansion and deepening of family conflicts, my younger brother has also risen up to demand freedom of marriage. In this way, the anti-feudal rule has been greatly revealed. Now, it has been seven or eight years, and my younger brother's old marriage contract has been cancelled before marriage, but the incident itself has not been restrained. Is it about severely punishing me, the "chief of the Rong," the "rebel"? But I am far from belonging to them.</p>
<p>My younger brother and sister each have their own crystallization products. My wife simply believes that I will definitely not grow a "tail," and that I am so proud that some people say that I am still a "loner" and that I always don't believe it. But when I can't get rid of my boredom, I will ask the servant to find a blind man to tell my fortune. She.</p>
<p>Originally, her fate was destined to be seen through at a glance by the "blind man." My mother knew that this third daughter-in-law would be the most capable person in the family in the future, so she gave the blind man a lot of money, and then sent a letter to report the good news and take her over early to receive her education, so as to show her great talents. Now, my mother has passed away, so of course only my mother's consultant - the blind man - can be consulted. In this way, she has spent six years and is now in her seventh year.</p>
<p>It is said that this time the fortune teller made a concrete conclusion: [There will definitely be two more "husbands" added, as long as this year passes]. However, the big premise, of course, is [breaking away from the disaster]. Passing this year is the goal set for [blank], but as far as I know, the addition of "two husbands" should be to change this original big premise to make it a bit possible.</p>
<p>It is also said that this time the fortune teller received a reward that exceeded my mother's by many times. And since that day, the poisonous and haggard face has occasionally had a faint smile from the depths of the heart pass over it.</p>
<p>It was about yesterday evening when the dusk had already spread and infiltrated the earth! A classmate came who was a new acquaintance but seemed like an old friend; after a short rest, he exclaimed as if he had made a big new discovery and stared at me! "Mr. Hao, are you married?" Because it was the first time we met, he used "Mr. Fa Xiang also." I said "yes" unnaturally, and then he came with a sentence, "You are a wife-killer." I lost my smile. "Look how high the corners of your eyes are," he came up with his "scientific" argument, as if he was afraid that I wouldn't believe him. I shook my head and said softly, "My words are accurate, your wife will not live long; last month, a certain civil servant's 'disaster' was said not long ago..." Again, he seemed to be so-called objective, and those who came with him also responded: "There is such a thing." Shadows fell on my face, and I imagined that I had something to say in my heart. After a while, he pressed forward again: "Your wife will die next year!" My mouth was dry from not saying much! After saying "definitely," he seemed to be afraid that I was anxious, "Fortune-telling is extremely difficult to see, the best or the worst fortunes seem to be not bad at all!"</p>
<p>I silently recited my fortune and my wife's fate, my wife's next year, two "next years," if there are two "next years" then she should live two more years, one plus one, is really equal to two! Since it is neither like the blind man's "next year" nor like the friend's "next year," I think it is a bit accurate! Isn't it said that there is such a thing as so-called eclecticism that can exist in the world now?</p>
<h3>Between Life and Death</h3>
<p>— Li Zhai</p>
<p>Recently, an Englishman named Phil Dam published a strange advertisement in the London Daily Express, expressing to all relatives and friends, "Instead of giving me wreaths after my death, it is better to take advantage of the present and give me cash!" After reading all this strange news, I couldn't help but close the newspaper and sigh, "As for Phil Dam, he is cynical and quite witty, but his understanding of the true meaning of life is still insufficient!" Why do I say this? Please see below!</p>
<p>In all ages and societies, the "sympathizers" who shed tears for the coffin are countless, while the good people who "help the poor and relieve difficulties" are originally very few. This is not because most people value death over life, but in the intangible philosophy of life, many people use the etiquette of reciprocity with deep meaning, and regard weddings, funerals, and celebrations as one of the "tactics" of people. Everyone is accustomed to doing the "icing on the cake" and regards helping people in need as a dangerous path. Gradually deduced, the result is of course "in prosperous times, there is a constant stream of traffic, and in times of decline, the door can be set up to catch sparrows." As for adding flattery or eulogy to the dead, whether the deceased is the old grandfather of a wealthy man or a traveler from a poor road, they are happy to give condolences, which is beneficial and harmless. Because, if the deceased himself or his son is of a higher status than oneself, then the words to mourn him prove that one's own communication is not "stiff," that one can "handle things" in public. If the deceased's status is below oneself, then putting one's own name on the eulogy can also prove that one is noble and prominent, but "does not forget old friends." If the deceased is one's own political enemy, or even if one has "helped a lot" in his death, then it is even more necessary to mourn him, first to show that one does not confuse public grievances with private feelings, and second to show one's own hidden pain of "I did not kill Bo Ren," which is the so-called "crocodile tears." Because of these three points, borrowing money from friends while alive often runs into walls everywhere, but sending funeral notices to collect wreaths and eulogies from people who are not close friends is often foolproof. Not only that, mourning death and pitying life have a big difference. Borrowing ten or five yuan from a friend, he will not "thank you in the newspaper" in fact, and it is inevitable that he will be "proud" once and come back to bother you a second time. Sending eulogies and wreaths to the dead is not the case. The "big name" is naturally marked high on the wreath or eulogy, and at the same time, the dead ghost will never bother you a second time. Therefore, there are many "benevolent gentlemen" who wave "a handful of tears of sympathy" to the dead who have already been buried, while those who open their wallets to help friends in need of food and clothing are few and far between!</p>
<p>What has been discussed above is the analysis of the psychology of the "sympathizers" who generally give gifts to the dead. At the same time, I want to expose one point, which is the psychology of the "filial sons and virtuous grandsons" who generally carry the dead to widely collect favors. In the sea of officialdom, where promotion and demotion are all ingenious, the death of parents is not simply a matter of mourning (or worry) and observing mourning customs. At the same time, in order to show off, especially to become famous, one must take the opportunity to use direct or indirect methods to get all the portraits, praises, inscriptions of the chairman, president, committee chairman, minister, and various celebrities and old masters, nail them into a very thick book, so that the dead man becomes a saint who "has virtue in his hometown," and the woman becomes a modern "Meng Tao" who is good at educating her children. In this way, not only will the dead smile in the nine springs (?), but the living will also have their "background" implied. Therefore, small things like defecating and eating, and big things like getting married and dying, are all "ingenious" in the upper class society of China.</p>
<p>There are too many "benevolent people" who flatter ghosts, and too few good people who save people. This is why China is in such a terrible state that it cannot be cleaned up!</p>
<h3>Gate of Hope</h3>
<p>— Wen</p>
<p>That was in June of this year. A friend named Zhang had his subsidy for the news agency he was running cut off due to the provincial government's "austerity policy," which put his livelihood in jeopardy. Naturally, he was struggling to start anew, but there were connections to exploit in Nanjing, and ways to consider back home. Should he return to his hometown, or seek opportunities in Beijing? This question mark kept battling in his mind, leaving him hesitant and indecisive. Finally, he came to me.</p>
<p>"Old Chen! I'm so bored! I've thought and thought about what I should do, but I still can't decide. If you have nothing else to do, let's go out and find someone to analyze characters or do divination... Of course, it's superstition, but it would make me feel better to waste two dollars on it! I'm just a mess at home, unable to figure out what to do..." Before my friend could finish explaining his intention, I stood up.</p>
<p>"Alright! I'll go with you. I might as well learn something from the fortune-tellers of Shanghai..." With that said, I put on my long gown and went out with him.</p>
<p>We got off at the New World and first went to a hotel on Tibet Road to find a very famous character analyst. Walking up to the third floor, our fortune-teller hadn't arrived yet. According to a teenage boy looking after the place, "Please have a seat, he'll be here in half an hour..." The fee was two dollars and twenty cents, which we paid as usual. Following the boy's instructions, we lit an incense stick and stuck it in the incense burner, and then shook out two character beads from the specially made "tool."</p>
<p>The fortune-teller was still not coming, so my friend and I took off our long gowns, wiping away sweat while observing the prices for character analysis, fortune-telling, and writing services hanging on the walls, as well as the slogan "Close friends and relatives, cash only." Mr. Zhang, always meticulous, had written a summary of the reasons for seeking character analysis to avoid any language barriers during the conversation, so that it would be clear at a glance. After waiting for half an hour, and with two more customers arriving to "seek guidance," the fortune-teller finally arrived leisurely. While taking off his long gown, he greeted us, repeatedly saying, "Sorry for the wait! I'm very sorry!"</p>
<p>After the usual pleasantries of "May I ask your name, and where is your esteemed residence..." the gentleman wiped the glass on the writing desk and poured water onto the brush from a large inkstone that looked somewhat like a "Han brick." He then enlarged and copied the characters on the character beads onto the glass.</p>
<p>The characters were "忠" (zhong, loyalty) and "羊" (yang, sheep). The fortune-teller began to "get down to business."</p>
<p>"Based on these two characters, I can say with certainty that your business must be pursued from Nanjing to have any hope! Because if you break down the character '忠' (zhong), the '心' (xin, heart) plus a stroke becomes '必' (bi, must), which together means 'must succeed.' But it must be during the Xin You month of July, in just over half a month, there will definitely be good news... Returning to Anhui is hopeless. The character '回' (hui, return) is two '口' (kou, mouth) characters, and adding a '口' (kou) to '忠' (zhong) becomes '患' (huan, trouble), so pursuing things back home is probably not a good idea. The result will only be sighing at the 'ocean' (the character '羊' (yang) plus three drops of water, which forms the character for ocean). Character analysis is just a bit of inspiration. I'll be bold and say that whether it's accurate or not will be clear in July. At that time, I'm afraid I'll be treated to a celebratory feast..."</p>
<p>"Extremely insightful! Thank you for your trouble!"</p>
<p>"It's nothing! It's nothing! You're too kind!"</p>
<p>After walking out of the hotel, I said with a smile, "You have to be clever to tell such nonsense!"</p>
<p>"It makes a lot of sense because I don't want to go back to Anhui at all!"</p>
<p>"A reassurance worth two dollars and twenty cents!"</p>
<p>We had breakfast at a restaurant on Nanjing Road. My friend still had two "Sun Yat-sens" (silver dollars) in his pocket, and he was still in high spirits. "Let's spend it all and go find 'Little Confused'!"</p>
<p>"Little Confused" was also one of Shanghai's "famous people," so we asked for directions to his place at a cigarette and paper shop on Guangxi Road.</p>
<p>We took a big detour and turned into Daqing Lane. In a downstairs room of a two-story building, we met Mr. Little Confused, who was hunched over, in his sixties, and balding. The room was filled with silver plaques and shields, and horizontal scrolls and couplets presented by figures like Wei Daofeng and Qu Yingguang. Mr. Zhang picked out the characters "爲" (wei, for) and "短" (duan, short) from a large pile of scrolls on the table. After explaining his intention, the old fortune-teller picked up his pen and "pronounced":</p>
<p>"Looking at these characters, your affairs will not succeed whether in Beijing or Anhui! Because the character '爲' (wei) has '爪' (zhua, claw) on top but no '瓜' (gua, melon), meaning there will be no results. And the bottom part is '似馬非馬' (si ma fei ma, like a horse but not a horse), '鳥不能飛' (niao bu neng fei, a bird cannot fly), which indicates a semblance of hope but ultimately no success. Moreover, half of the character '短' (duan) is '矢' (shi, arrow), and '矢' (shi) plus '走' (zou, walk) is '迭' (die, repeatedly), meaning repeated failures! So, now you can only wait quietly for an opportunity. There is too little hope at the moment! Too little!..."</p>
<p>After finishing his myth, the silver dollar was taken out and paid - one dollar and twenty cents.</p>
<p>"Little Confused made me even more confused! It's like he's memorized those dozens of words. Why 'like a horse but not a horse'? Why 'a bird cannot fly'? '矢' (shi) plus '走' (zou) is '迭' (die), 'repeated failures' - why not 'repeated successes'? Heh, '矢' (shi) plus '走 走' (zou zou), isn't that a character at all! Nonsense! Ugh!" My friend, upon leaving the door, recited this like a mantra all the way back.</p>
<h3>New Business Sutras</h3>
<p>— Jianren</p>
<p>Recently, commercial competition has become increasingly bizarre. In the past, there were "big sales" and the like, but only two or three times a year. There was also quite a bit of lively decoration, but never with the extravagance and cleverness of today. The intensity of the struggle for survival is evident, but in this battle to win over consumers, many geniuses, creators, and "new business sutras" are naturally emerging.</p>
<p>In this year of constant sales, it is not easy to win over customers. Even if the decorations are as lavish as possible, they can only attract idle onlookers. To make customers open their wallets and let the shiny gold coins flow out, you need to find another way. Therefore, this year's business sutras must have the following magic weapons: setting up a discount department; buy one get one free; two-hour sales; giving away brocade pennants, gift certificates, amusement park tickets, photography vouchers; and finally, giving away national salvation lottery tickets with a first prize of 500,000 yuan, redeemable by luck... Ah ah! Truly endless Shanghai prosperity and merchant ingenuity.</p>
<p>However, these are still ordinary business practices, and have not yet shed the airs of being a businessman. As for a groundbreaking page in the 1933 business sutras, I must recommend a certain merchant's gift of "classic books." This is truly beyond the expectations of ordinary people, and is elegant, morally upright, timely, and profitable all at the same time. This is indeed a new invention, worthy of the attention of the business community and those outside it. And the foresight of a certain merchant makes us ordinary people admire them to the point of prostration. Magistrate Dong of Funing County ordered the recitation of the "Classic of Filial Piety," which was once praised as a good story. Now, it cannot be exclusively beautiful. "The preciousness of the classics can be imagined from this." Logical! Logical! Another gift of 10,000 copies is truly generous of the boss! I have nothing to say.</p>
<p>However, from this, I can't help but think that after there is a Master Lu with pockmarks, there might be a Master Huang with pockmarks. The development of this business sutra has a very broad future. However, although the magic weapon is the same, different methods and skill levels will produce different results. Some people like to read the Four Books, but others like to read the history of sex. People's [gap] [gap] and [gap] [gap] are different, but they should not be [gap] [gap] used rigidly. Now, I will promote and expand this classic, and the "holy books" and "registers" that can be given away are as follows:</p>
<p>I think: Women's bookstores, cosmetics companies, women's English tutoring night schools, and the YWCA should give away a copy of the "Daughter Classic" for every one yuan spent, or for joining a tutoring class or becoming a member, limited to 20 million copies.</p>
<p>Children's bookstores and toy stores can give away a copy of the "Classic of Filial Piety," the more copies the better.</p>
<p>Hotels, ships, trains, and long-distance buses should give away "Travel Guides." Bathhouses and massage parlors should give away nude painting vouchers. Brothels and private houses should give away a copy of the New 606 Instructions or Dr. Zhang Jingsheng's History of Sex. Dance halls and movie theaters should give away a volume of Zhang Ziping's Triangular Love Novel as the most interesting. In addition, "holy books" and "registers" can be given away according to the nature of the "business," and the application is infinite.</p>
<p>In addition, gifts can be given to customers according to their age, gender, and status, to better suit their needs. For example, old women can be given a copy of the "Jade Box Record," old men can be presented with a chapter of the "Book of Supreme Induction"; young mistresses need the "Treatise on Safe Childbirth"; and young masters need to read the "Art of Getting Rich." All can be matched according to their needs, and I can guarantee that business will flourish. As for modern men and women, "modern youths," if they do not want to read the "classics," they can be given "a bunch of love letters" or "two bunches," a thick book of "beauty techniques," and a thin book on the art of controlling your wife or husband. I guarantee you will receive smiling faces and shiny foreign coins flowing out of their purses like water. Thus, the "way" of the new business sutras is complete. It not only promotes its own unsellable goods, but also does a business that second-hand bookstores could not have dreamed of. It also earns the beautiful names of "upholding morality" and "elegance," and the grateful tears of many old-fashioned people. Is there anything more beneficial in the world? This "new business sutra" is worthy of being greatly promoted and specially promoted. Therefore, I wrote "New Business Sutras."</p>

<h3>Shanghai (30)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>(43) The Sky of Shanghai</p>
<p>The gloomy weather, with clouds like a weight pressing down on one's head, gave people an unspeakable feeling of suffocation and depression. After Sister Hui left, the entire afternoon was spent in the office, with Xin Di, Little Huang and I sitting silently. Little Huang was indignant at the unconditional terms published in today's newspapers, saying, "This is simply outrageous! If I were the mayor, I would never agree! I would rather turn Shanghai into the desolate wilderness of fifty years ago! Look at the power of our people!" He kept extending his fan-sized fist.</p>
<p>"A weak country has no diplomacy, but there is still a chance to fight this time..."</p>
<p>A voice like breaking glass, "Extra! Extra!" flew past the door. As if we had been waiting for it, we all rushed out at the same time. On this usually quiet Rue de Bannes, there were clusters of people, each face marked with a question mark. If you bought an extra and tried to stand still on the street to read it, a crowd would quickly gather around you, and the crowd would grow larger and larger. This is how the clusters of people gathered.</p>
<p>Little Huang bought an extra—or rather, snatched it. He put the copper coin in the newsboy's hand and ran off. "Extra! Extra!" The trembling cry vibrated in the gloomy air, making people feel as if something terrifying was about to happen. As soon as I leaned forward, two people who hadn't managed to get an extra surrounded me.</p>
<p>"What? Are we going to fight?" one asked.</p>
<p>"I heard the conditions were agreed to!" the other replied, but the tone of his voice was not very trusting.</p>
<p>"Agreed to." Little Huang wanted to hand the newspaper to me, but the person who had asked intercepted it.</p>
<p>Back in the office, we turned on the electric light, and the two of us remained silent, of course, with the same distrust of the agreement. In the evening, Xiaofeng and Chongbian did not return. Sheng Di said they had gone to Zhabei to pick up relatives.</p>
<p>My heart was spinning like a wheel, and I couldn't fall asleep. In the middle of the night, the surroundings were as silent as death. I seemed to faintly hear gunfire. Little Huang jumped out of bed and said that Zhabei must have opened fire. He hurriedly got up, pushed open the window, and looked into the distance. A head poked out of the window across the street and asked loudly if we had heard anything.</p>
<p>"Gunfire!" Little Huang replied.</p>
<p>As he spoke, the sound rang out again. The disturbance lasted all night until dawn. The rattling sound of airplanes in the sky confirmed everything. Outside, there was a lot of talk about the Japanese suffering a defeat.</p>
<p>"Go to Zhabei!" Little Huang laughed triumphantly, "Look at the power of our people!"</p>
<p>I entrusted Xin Di to Afu and sent him to Gao Fei's house, telling him that we were leaving and asking Gao Fei to come to the office to settle things.</p>
<p>"I want to go to my sister's house," Xin Di said.</p>
<p>"Okay. Your sister will definitely come today. You can stay with your uncle." We left.</p>
<p>My cousin arrived at the office a few minutes after we left. Xin Di told her what we had said. She searched my bedroom for a while, and seeing that there was no note or anything, she leaned against the window and wept.</p>
<p>"Sister," Xin Di leaned against Sister Hui's side.</p>
<p>"Brother..." She stroked her brother's hair.</p>
<p>The rattling sound of airplanes filled the sky of Shanghai.</p>

<p>Film Special</p>
<h3>Interview with Chinese Film Artists (30) (Continued from December 19th)</h3>
<p>— Sha Ji</p>
<p>(13) Wu Cun, Director of "Wind" (Part 1)</p>
<p>I believe that readers are quite unfamiliar with this new figure. Although you have rarely had the opportunity to get to know him through his past works, in the near future, you will definitely be able to appreciate his artistic style in his "Wind."</p>
<p>In order to make it easier for readers to understand him, I will first give you a general introduction.</p>
<p>He is from Xiamen, Fujian, and is only twenty-nine years old this year. During the great Chinese turmoil of 1925, he edited the supplement of a newspaper in Xiamen. This newspaper should have a glorious place and history in the history of the Chinese revolution, but it was shut down due to the impact of the waves of darkness. From then on, he left his hometown in bloodshed and began to step into the Shanghai film industry.</p>
<p>As early as the age of fifteen, he devoted himself to the spoken drama movement. This was because the educational and business circles in Xiamen at that time vigorously maintained the public performance of new dramas every year during the annual and summer vacations, which lasted for two months. Therefore, there were many opportunities to perform at that time, which cannot but be the most memorable era for his personal drama cultivation.</p>
<p>Since joining the film industry in 1925, he continued for six years, from writing scene notes to assistant director. It was not until 1931 that he produced his maiden work, entitled "Blood Flower and Tears," which was produced by Fudan Film Company. In July of this year, he joined Lianhua No. 2 Factory, and his second work was this "Wind."</p>
<p>The following is a record of his conversation.</p>
<p>The morning of the third day after the winter solstice; the weather was still so warm, it was really strange weather. Walking on the pebble road next to Yanping Road, the faint fragrance of vegetables came from the vegetable garden on the right. People who have lived in the city for a long time cannot help but take a deep breath in this fresh atmosphere.</p>
<p>When I was about to reach the gate of Lianhua No. 2 Factory, I caught up with a young man in a suit. He had his hands in the pockets of his overcoat, and each of his armpits was carrying a grapefruit. Because he looked quite like my friend Dai Jun, I looked at him carefully, because Dai Jun and I had not met for several years. In the end, I ran ahead of him and reached the gate of the Second Factory. I asked the gatekeeper:</p>
<p>"Hey, is Mr. Wu Cun inside?" (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Vanity Misled"</h3>
<p>— Yiqun</p>
<p>Walls of Gold</p>
<p>丨 Produced by Fox Company, screening at Great Shanghai 丨</p>
<p>This is an ugly history of a family, depicting an uncle snatching his nephew's lover, and a younger sister taking her older sister's lover. The main theme seems to be to expose the power of money, which ultimately cannot defeat true love. In the world, only those who can use true love can last, and only then can lovers be united. Those who use money for evil will ultimately be punished. The story is bland and unremarkable, just an old tune.</p>
<p>Now let's talk about other things.</p>
<p>First of all, regarding the central consciousness of the screenwriter; I think that the main theme of the play is to expose the evil consequences of buying love with gold, and to promote true love. Therefore, in addition to depicting the ugliness of the power of money, there should be a clear indication of love, so as not to focus on one thing and lose sight of the other. However, it is a pity that in this play, we only see that the copper and iron tycoon Gao Tong uses his power of money to do evil everywhere. We do not see where the true love between JeanieanieSattelea or Honey Satterl and BarnesRitchie is built. The love between the two sisters for Barnes, one by one, all seems very accidental, like "made in heaven," and like "love at first sight." After all, why do they love each other? What is the true love between them that is not built on money, and it is not expressed enough. Moreover, the combination of Barnes and Honey, and Jeanie and the copper and iron tycoon, are all given in a kind of forced coming together because of anger. Whether this combination of angry doctrine can be said to be love is, of course, the ultimate joke! Speaking of this, I recall that this is the opinion of the Americans, and I have nothing to say.</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the director's technique, I think it is not bad. The division of scenes is very clean, the camera is very flexible, and several small comic scenes are readily available and very natural and appropriate. But it is a pity that the handling of the copper and iron tycoon's robbery and murder is too improper.</p>
<p>As for the performance, I don't think Sally Eilers is very special, but she can be called qualified. Ralph Morgen is still successful. He shows the ugly state of the idle and wealthy in society. Every move is very tasteful, and it makes people think of the typical characters they see and hear in their daily lives.</p>
<p>In short, although this play is not a successful work, it can still complete its task in exposing the ugliness of money.</p>
<p>Finally, Guan's translation of the name as "Vanity Misled" is really not appropriate, especially Jdanie is not translated as Jenny, but as Qin Qi, and Honey is not translated as Hong Ni, but as Hong Qi, which is also thought to be inappropriate. I hope that the organizers of Great Shanghai will pay attention to it.</p>
<h3>The Boredom of Screen Lovers</h3>
<p>— Huaming</p>
<p>This is the most unfortunate news in Hollywood in 1933. A famous Hollywood screen lover has now split up from each other and become a pitiful person in the sky of hatred in the film industry. This matter may occupy a page in the history of the film industry, causing future generations to feel a lot of emotion.</p>
<p>At first, when Janet Gaynor and Charles Farrell co-starred in "The Tide of Love," there were many rumors in Hollywood that Charles Farrell's contract with Fox had expired, and after "The Tide of Love" was completed, he would retire and live at home, and would no longer work for the film industry. Soon after this news was produced, it became a fact. Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor broke up and ended their relationship as lovers on the screen. The occurrence of this accident caused people in Hollywood and other places who knew their status and history in the film industry to sigh very much.</p>
<p>Then there was the unfortunate thing between Jeanette MacDonald and Maurice Chevalier. The two of them in the Hollywood film industry, like Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor, were called screen lovers, but they, like Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor, unfortunately broke up. When Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald were closest in the film industry, how envious they were. But now they are also separated, and people in Hollywood no longer recognize them as screen lovers. Indeed, they enjoyed the same luck and glory as Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor, and at the same time have feelings that they cannot bear to look back on.</p>
<p>Strangely, although Charles Farrell and Janet Gaynor separated, Charles Farrell and his wife still lived happily and enjoyed family happiness, while Janet Gaynor divorced her husband, Liddell Beck. The separation of Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette MacDonald was just the opposite. Jeanette MacDonald and her husband were still happy in France, while Maurice Chevalier divorced his wife, Pony Fan Li. The endings of these two screen lovers happened to become a natural inverse proportion.</p>
<h3>New Attempts in the British Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Compete with Hollywood for the World</p>
<p>Fairbanks has Joined the Cooperation</p>
<p>This is truly an important development in the British film industry. According to the latest news, London Films has joined forces with Fairbanks to organize a large-scale film company. British artists, technicians, and first-class American artists from Hollywood who are in leading positions will be recruited. This new organization will change the eyes of people all over the world, because in the past three years, Britain has removed a deep barrier and gradually broken away from the oppression of the American film industry. At present, British products have become the first in the world in terms of films needed by various countries other than American products.</p>
<p>Fairbanks' vision is very long-term. The things he is starting to do will soon be imitated by general entrepreneurs in the United States. Fairbanks' first film in England will be directed by Alexander Korda of London Films, and the film is titled Don Juan. Then he will re-shoot his successful silent film Zero as a sound film. His son will play a supporting role with him in this film. The first film to be shot is Catherine The Great of Russia, with Fairbanks Jr. playing the young Russian emperor and Elizabeth Paul Wagner playing Catherine.</p>
<p>Although the names of other new actors have not been announced, it is generally believed that five famous British actors will join this organization. They are Leslie Howard, Charles Laughton, Herbert Marshall, and Clifton Webb. Within the realm of possibility, Boris Karloff may also join. In the future, this group may build its own studio, but now it is shooting films at the Empire Studio.</p>
<p>Three years ago, British films did not occupy any position in the world, but now British films are being shown in all countries around the world like films from other countries. In future attempts, the British film industry has resolved to defeat the United States and completely take the Hollywood film industry into British hands.</p>
<h3>"Flying Flower Village" is the First Shot of Four Plays</h3>
<p>— Chu</p>
<p>In mid-January next year, Yihua Company stipulated that four plays should be filmed one after another. One is "Golden Age" directed by Bu Wancang, one is "Woman" directed by Shi Dongshan, one is "Flying Flower Village" directed by Zheng Yingshi, and one is "Love's Adulthood" directed by Ying Yunwei. But according to the decision of a crew meeting yesterday, Zheng Yingshi's "Flying Flower Village" has been ranked as the first shot. It will be put into production this week.</p>
<p>"Flying Flower Village" tells a tragic story about a train driver A Hua and his beautiful wife under the brutal forces of the current society. Because it focuses on exposure, this play is bound to be lively and stimulating. Everyone at the script meeting believed that this kind of play was quite valuable.</p>
<h3>Anniversary Celebration Held in the Club</h3>
<p>Jin Yan is a very warm-hearted man. Although he occupies the highest position in the Chinese film industry, he is very humble in his dealings with people. He is as kind and affectionate to his colleagues, even a tea house worker, as he is to his own brothers. At the Lianhua colleagues' party, he left his seat to serve dishes to his colleagues. Although this is not a big deal, it should be said to be an expression of his enthusiasm.</p>
<p>The New Year is approaching, and Jin Yan and Fei Mu have launched a New Year celebration in the Lianhua No. 1 Factory Club, preparing for everyone to gather together during the New Year. Fei Mu supplied various foods, Jin Yan supplied a large box of wine, and factory director Li Minwei and Liang Bocixing Shaomei and others also supplied items. Now, other colleagues are also enthusiastically participating. It is generally expected that the New Year will be lively enough.</p>
<h3>The Two Rivers Women's School A Galaxy of Stars</h3>
<p>Sun Yu, director of Lianhua Film Company's No. 2 Studio, is making further efforts after "Little Toys" with his film "The Athletic Queen." On the 19th, he borrowed the Two Rivers Normal School of Physical Education to film outdoor school scenes. Due to bad weather, there were no gains, but the next day the sun shone and everything went very smoothly. The actresses participating in the filming include Li Lili, Wang Moqiu, Wang Yan, and the newcomer Bai Lu, with Yin Xu making a guest appearance. The male actors include Zhang Yi, Shang Guanwu, Han Langan, Yin Xiucen, and Li Junqing, etc. These movie stars mingling with their "athletic queen" counterparts and galloping on the sports field truly create a dazzling spectacle like a galaxy of stars. On this day, dozens of shots were filmed throughout the entire day, only completing half of the school life scene. Therefore, they went again on the third day and filmed all day to finish this scene.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>The Fire of Youth (2)</h3>
<p>— Hou Feng</p>
<p>"The Fire of Youth" is burning in Commander Hu's mansion. Zhang Jisen, Da Xiong's secretary, has long been drooling over Ailian. However, Ailian already has He Mengxian in her heart. Therefore, she only feels disgust for Zhang Jisen.</p>
<p>One evening, when Mengxian had already put on his pajamas and was preparing to sleep, Ailian sneaked into his room and saw a half-length portrait of Xu Lanfen with the words "Mengxian's Kiss" written on it, which made her feel infinitely sad. She actually took down the photo and erased the word "kiss." Da Xiong returned home and saw Ailian being so affectionate with Mengxian in Mengxian's room, and couldn't help but be consumed by jealousy. Ailian took the initiative and walked over with Lanfen's photo, smiling and saying to Da Xiong:</p>
<p>"Look, isn't our future cousin-in-law beautiful!" leaving Da Xiong speechless again.</p>
<p>Da Xiong left home to go to the province to thank the commissioner. Ailian tried even more to seduce Mengxian. Another evening: Ailian called Mengxian to her room, saying that she wanted him to write a letter to the commander for her. At this time, Mengxian, although he knew that the magistrate had a wife, was not Liu Xiahui. How could he not be moved by this profound temptation? Therefore, under the development of this natural law, Mengxian gradually became estranged from Lanfen under Ailian's generous treatment. One day, Lanfen came to Hu's mansion to look for Mengxian, only to see Mengxian and Ailian sitting together having breakfast, but Ailian had her maid hide it from Mengxian and refused to see Lanfen, saying "Mr. He is not at home!"</p>
<p>This fire of youth is becoming increasingly serious. Zhang Jisen tried his best to alienate Mengxian and Ailian's relationship, and to make him reconcile with Lanfen. He went to Xu's house to see Lanfen, and was severely reprimanded by Lanfen. Later, her sister Huifen explained it to him and asked him to move out of Hu's mansion and leave Ailian. So, amidst the conflict of these two emotions, he agreed to Huifen's request—to move out of Hu's mansion, giving Lanfen a factual explanation. But when Mengxian returned to Hu's mansion and wanted to move out, Ailian refused. She said: "If you move out so hastily, how can I explain it to the commander when he comes back? He will definitely blame me for offending you, or even suspect that I am with you... How can I live like this?" Later, Mengxian decided to move out of Hu's mansion. He even wrote a letter of refusal to Ailian. But that letter was taken away by Zhang Jisen using a trick. In this circle of love, a new situation was created after the change. (To be continued)</p>
