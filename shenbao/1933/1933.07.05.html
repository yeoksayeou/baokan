<p>中東路買賣交涉</p>
<h3 id="c16">蘇俄索價甚昂路價二萬一千萬盧布 <a href="#c16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>日本以不積極斡旋要挾</p>
<p>（東京）今晚蘇俄大使署發、表關於出售中東鐵路談判之詳細說帖、内開蘇俄願以二一○、○○○○○○金盧布出售所有中東鐵路之權利云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）昨日舉行之俄滿會議歷時逾五小時據今日發表之公報稱、俄滿代表提出關於中東鐵路之建議與自已方面之意見、而將於星期三日全體會議中討論之聞雙方提出之條件相去甚遠、但非不可轉　、蘇俄現索價鐵路本身爲二一○、○○○、○○○金盧布、另加與該路有關之北滿蘇俄木塲等讓與權四○、○○○、○○○金盧布、「滿洲國」給價日金五千萬元屬於該路之產業在外、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）俄代表在中東路賣買第三次會議提議與「滿洲國」大相懸殊、即俄方要求之中東路及其一切附帶事業代價、比「滿洲國」所豫想之額多十倍、因此四日兩方研究各自要求之是否正當、以備下次會議重行商議、（四日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）中東路賣買會議於三日下午三時半開其第三次會議、日本鈴木中佐及西歐美第一課長傍聽、今日由俄大使由禮尼夫任主席、蘇俄代表先述出賣中東路原則的方針、其次「滿洲國」代表亦披瀝收買鐵路之根本原則、其後兩方商議種種問題至晚九時始散會、同時發表如下公報、「本日會議俄滿兩方均有提出關於東路問題之提議及見解此項提議、將於下次會議審理、下次會議定於五日下午二時半開會、」會議又决定每於會議散後發表公報、（四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）中東路賣買會議第三日、俄滿兩方提出具體事項、發表鐵路價格、因此會議頗爲緊張、俄主席代表由禮尼夫大使及其他代表等迭次發言說明俄方提案之合理的根據、「滿洲國」代表丁士源及大橋外次亦說明滿洲方面見解、俄方昨日提案多含政治的意義之成分、且兩方主張之東路價格大有懸隔、前途尙有曲折、（四日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）中東路買賣交涉、昨日第三次會議之結果、俄滿間意見大相懸殊、豫料前途必有糾紛、即（一）對於讓渡之對照物件、滿洲方面欲將蘇俄所有之中東路合辦權及中東路附帶事業、一併包括、蘇俄則主張中東路所有權、主張附帶事業分别估價、（二）關於估價之基準、滿洲方面欲以「滿洲國」獨立後之經濟價値爲準據、蘇俄方面則欲凖據帝政時代之投資條件、及千九百廿四五年之覺書趣旨即對於將來之估價、蘇俄方面欲積極的承認價値、滿洲方面則消極的、（三）賣却價格、雖未具體决定、然雙方主張已有鉅額之懸殊、蘇俄方面索價甚昻、苟不虚心怛懷、從事折衝、前途曲折正多、（四日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）聞俄代表昨日在會議提議之内容如下、㈠俄方出賣中東路、滿洲里至哈爾濱間西段、哈爾濱至綏芬間東段及哈爾濱至寛城子間南段各路、（俄方表明價格、但現不能公表）、㈡中東路之附帶事業如煤礦·森林·發電所·及其他各種附屬事業、亦與鐵路合併出賣㈢關於中東路之所謂法國僨權及中國政府之抗議等、不成問題、（四日聯電）</p>
<p>（南京）昨日之中東鐵道交涉、尙未有何項具體的審議、因兩國主張相距頗遠、且於金額一點、雙方所言價値、亦相距十餘億、故前途早有難關今後俄方若無妥恊態度、而評議决裂外務當局謂、日方不積極的斡旋、（四日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）據日外務省所宣傳、謂昨日之中東路交涉席上、俄方提起僞滿截斷綏芬河轉接點之問題、並謂「滿洲國」應負賠償其損失之責、僞滿對此點甚不滿意、擬於明日會議席上、將舉六項理由駁斥俄方之主張云、（四日華聯電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）今晨經濟大會主幹部指導委員會集議、决定主幹部應於星期四日召集全體大會、宣佈休會、又决定凡能工作之各股員會應照常進行、至星期四日爲止、休會之議、係荷相柯里恩所提出比代表希孟法代表龐萊附議、美代表考克斯則未投票贊成、聞美方將反對休會、英首相麥唐納與商相任錫曼旣不贊成此議亦未反對之但謂專家現尙有時間就美總統宣言之新根據討論大會問題云、主幹部全體大會定午後四時舉行、延會提議現似必被通過、果爾則主幹部將仍存在、以維持大會機關、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）世界經濟大會已在黃金礁石上擱淺、羅斯福總統宣言所造成之僵局、居然莫可打開、今尙待决定者、爲延會之條件耳、今日午後之會議、殆有三種辦法、㈠大會之完全廢棄、㈡保存大會辦事之機關、㈢以將來獲级穏定時重行召集會議之權授與主席後延會、說者認第三辦法爲最善、休會旣直接由於穏定幣價之問題、故衆料重開會議之正式日期、必不能預定、（四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）歐洲維持金本位之法·意·比·荷蘭·瑞士·五國簽發共同宣言云、</p>
<p>「簽署本宣言各政府、深信維持其幣價在世界經濟復興上在恢復信用活動上俱屬根本要圖、且爲各國所造成之社會進步之保障、因此重行申明任各該本國照現行黃金比價於現行貨幣法律之結構内、維持一自由運用的金本位之堅决志願、並請各該中央銀行保持密切合作、俾予此項宣言最大之效能、」</p>
<p>此項宣言係在法代表所寓薩伏愛旅館會議時簽定、用以答復美總統所發表之美國貨幣政策、</p>
<p>英代表圑料亦將發一單獨宣言、但迄今尙未發出、據聞各英領土至少在目下不發正式宣言、（三日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）自美國反對臨時安定方案後、法代表即拒絶出席下午之治本小組委員會、而與荷比瑞士波蘭意大利代表會商草擬重申維持金本位宣言、</p>
<p>謂將令各中央銀行合作、維持各該貨幣對黃金現有比價、此種宣言不啻對美宣告貨幣戰爭、會議定將因此而决裂、故大多數代表現皆主張立即休會、（三日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）美代表圑今晨集議時、國務卿赫爾聲稱、經濟大會之工作必須進行、此後工作必注重提高世界物價云、（四日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美代表圑之各份子對於羅斯福總統之宣言、認爲大不幸事、雖美代表圑將反對延會、但若果通過延會、則美代表將贊成第二項或第三項辦法、聞美代表對此兩種辦法意見刻未一致、現悉美代表數人覺目今地位至爲複雜、不能有何進行、因美總統之言論已引起劇烈的仇美情事、致使無事可成也、（四日路透電）（倫敦）美代表圑不滿意於經濟大會延會責在羅斯福總統之說、現擬在今日午後主幹部會議中作驚人行動、衆料美代表將向大會提出具體辦法、以示美國有合作之意、又有人謂美代表之提議、將與提高世界物價有關、（四日路透電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）法國在倫敦經濟會議代表圑之態度、今已明白表示毫無疑義、法財長龐萊曾于星期日與總理達拉第午餐、雙方接談甚久、事後復與法國銀行總裁穆萊氏磋、商同日下午法總統勒勃倫氏復在倍桑崗地方發表重要演說稱、「通貨若繼續漲落、則法國對於將來之加入任何有效條約永久恊定等、俱屬子之談」云虚、龐萊氏已於星期日晚間返倫敦、據官方所表示、法國代表此後之態度、爲聯合各大陸金本位集圑之國家無條件遵守現在之策略、以求通貨之穏定、（三日國民電）（巴黎）因倫敦經濟會議形勢不甚順利法國政府感覺有提高關關稅率之可能故于今晨向國會要求畀予非常權力、達拉第總理並于事後向社會黨代表圑說明、謂政府所要求之非常權力、並無傾向於全權之意、自不至减損國會主權云、（四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國政府已開始籌備防止美國貨品侵入法國市塲之工作、并據可靠方面消息、法國内閣已豫擬决定現行關稅休戰於七月三十一日滿期後、即不再加以繼續、并將增加美國貨品之入口稅以謀保護本國市塲、（三日國民電）</p>

<p>三日哈瓦斯社日内瓦電述宋子文向國聯行政院陳述技術合作計劃請。求指派聯絡員並稱國聯行政院已準備組織特别委員會令採有益措置此。事件之足以引起國人注意較之棉麥借欵當有過之無不及也且棉麥借欵爲突來之消息中國與國聯之技術合作則有三年以上之史跡可尋今請先述此事之歷史。</p>
<p>當二十年春間國聯之勞工局長衛生部長及水利專員旣先後來華考察。宋子文即以國民政府財政部長資格向國聯致合作請求書同時設置全國經濟委員會以樹合作之基礎未幾宋氏之「十年建設大計劃」與國聯勞工局及行政院之「發展中國十年計劃」更先後發表國聯之發展中國十年計劃係以蘇俄五年計劃爲藍本其要點爲㈠開墾三萬英畝之中國荒地㈡擴充全中國之鐵路公路空中航線及其他交通事業㈢沿中國海岸建築若干海港㈣建造商輪八百萬噸供海上及内河商運之用㈤建造大工廠以製造供給華人所需要之物件此計劃公表後日人即高嚷國聯準備共管中國九一八事變起後之三月日本論客鈴江言一在其論文中指宋氏與國聯之合作實激起反對派與日本共謀抵制之運動以造成瀋陽之突擊鈴江。之言雖不足盡信惟此兩事之非毫無關係則有識者所共了解也國難起後。國聯敎育專家尙於一二八滬戰以前來華考察至最近國聯法制專家亦至。南京而代我國整理行政法令中國與國聯合作之事並不因抗日而停止亦。昭昭可見。</p>
<p>今在塘沽恊定簽字逾一月大連會議作中日重要恊商之日宋氏更向國聯行政院報告「中國决定在若干省區加緊建設工作使成爲模範區域」之計劃請指定技術員一名作較爲密切之聯絡吾人在國内未獲快讀宋氏建設若干模範省區之文件對於此事不能取得討論之適當材料惟以前之「十年建設大計劃」及「發展中國十年計劃」中似無成立模範省區之一項今此新計劃是否因在華國際勢力之改變而遷就現實改整個中國之建設爲若干省小範圍之建設乎。</p>
<p>利用外國資本與外國技術均非純粹有利或純粹有害之事要視利用者之能力如何耳以前之美日兩國均以利用外資而興國但剛果埃及則不可。同日言矣蘇俄現方利用美國技師美國機械以進行其五年計劃建設成績。驚動世界今中國之與國聯技術合作能追踪蘇俄造成驚人之建設成績乎。抑將爲所控制如日人所詛咒之釀成共管局面乎此吾人聞合作之聲而不能不惴惴危懼者也。</p>

<p>自由談專家之形成  林微音要是你有恒心，就是說要是你肯把同一件事說了又說的話，你要成爲一個專家並不是很困難的事。比如說你想成爲一個吃酒專家，那未你可今天寫一篇文章說酒吃了有怎樣的用處，明天寫一篇文章說不吃酒的人怎樣沒有詩意，或者沒有英雄氣，隨便說一個什麽都行，只要得說。你還可從中外的歷史上，不，只要從文學史上（這樣還可附帶地證明你是一個文學家，因爲你旣然那麽熟悉文學史上的掌故，使人不相信你是個文學家是不可能的）去找出例證來，說那個詩人能一口氣喝三斗，那個小說家能繼着不停地連喝七天。或者拉扯地說誰因爲多喝酒的緣故，生出來的兒子才是天才；或者誰的所以寫不出好文章，就是爲了不喝酒。或者甚至編一個故事說，那無法得到酒喝的人怎樣以置了一些鹽的茶來代它，這就更可證明人在無論什麽環境中，酒總是無可或缺。而且你要說得像煞有介事，彷彿人家是都不喝酒，或者不懂　喝酒的，要是有，那是受了你的文章的影響。於是你的吃酒專家無疑地是形成了，以後有人要提到酒的就不能不先提到你，以及你的關於酒的文章。同時還有一樣好處；··要是你的太太不許你喝酒，你可振振有詞了；或者你自已以爲喝酒於身體有害，又不肯不喝，也可稍稍以此自解了。還有，你不要以爲自已不大會喝酒，就不能宣說以上的一切；正相反，要不大會的才會宣說得津津有味。比如你說某種菜息樣怎樣好，也許正是爲了你不常吃到那種菜的緣故。見人就稱讚雅片烟的是一個沒有上癮的人，至多只是證明他抽過雅片烟，上了癮的人就不會到處稱讚它了。所以母須疑慮，吃酒專家是你的。談「文人無行」  谷春帆雖說自已也忝列於所謂「文人」之「林」，但近來對於「文人無行」這句話，却頗表示幾分同意，而對於「人心不古」，「世風日下」的感喟，也不完全視爲「道學先生」的偏激之言。實在，今日「人心」險毒得太令人可怕了，尤其是所謂「文人」，想得出，做得到，種種卑劣行爲如陰謀中傷，造謠誣蔑，公開告密，賣友求榮賣身投靠的勾當，舉不勝舉。而在另一方面自吹自擂，　然以「天才」與「作家」自命，偷竊他人唾餘，還沾沾自喜的種種怪象，也是「無醜不備有惡皆臻」對着這些痛心的事實，我們還能夠否認「文人無行」這句話的相當眞實嗎？（自然，我也並不是說凡文人皆無行。）我們能不興起「世道人心」的感喟嗎？自然，我這樣的感觸並不是毫沒來由的。舉實事來說，過去有曾某其人者，硬以「管他娘」與「打打麻將」等屁話來實行其所謂「詞的解放」，被人斥爲「輕薄少年」與「色情狂的急色兒」，曾某却嘮嘮叨叨辯個不休，現在呢，新的事實又證明了曾某不僅是一個輕薄少年，而且是陰毒可憎的蛇蝎，他可以借崔萬秋的名字爲自已吹牛（見二月崔在本報所登廣告）甚至硬把日本一個打字女和一個中學敎員派做「女詩人」和「大學敎授」把自已吹捧得無微不至；他可以用最卑劣的手段投稿於小報，指他的朋友爲ＸＸＸ，並公佈其住址，把朋友公開出賣。（見第五號中外書報新聞）這樣的大胆，這樣的陰毒，這樣的無聊，實在使我不能相信這是一個有廉恥有人格的「人」丨尤其是「文人」，所能做出。然而曾某却眞想得到，眞做得出，我想任何人當不能不佩服曾某的大無畏的精神。聽說曾某年紀還不大，也並不是沒有讀書的機會，我想假如曾某能把那種吹牛拍馬的精力和那種陰毒機巧的心思用到求實學一點上，所得不是要更多些嗎？然而曾某却偏要日以吹拍爲事，日以造謠中傷爲事，這，一方面固愈足以顯曾某之可怕，另一方面亦正見靑年自誤之可惜。不過，話說回頭，就是受過高等敎育的也未必一定能束身自好，比如以專寫三角戀愛小說出名，並發財了的張ＸＸ，彼固動輒以日本某校出身自炫者，然而他最近也會在一些小報上潑辣呌嘷，完全一副滿懷毒恨的「棄婦」的臉孔，他會陰謀中傷，造謠挑撥，他會硬派人像布哈林或列寗，簡直想要置你於死地，其人格之卑汚，手段之惡辣，可說空前絶後，這樣看來，高等敎育又有何用？還有新出版之某無聊刋物上有署名「白羽遐」者作「内山書店小坐記」一文，公然說某人常到内山書店，曾請内山書店救過命保過險。我想，這種公開告密的勾當，大槪也就是一流人化名玩出的花樣。然而無論他們怎樣造謠中傷，怎樣陰謀陷害，明眼人一見便知，害人不着不過徒然暴露他們自已的卑汚與無人格而已。但，我想，「有行」的「文人」，對於這班醜類，實在不應當像現在一樣，始終置之不理，而應當振臂奮起，把　們驅逐於文壇以外，應當在汚穢不堪的中國文壇，做一番掃除的工作！巧女和獃娘的故事  趙景深在林蘭搜集了呆女婿故事以後，現在又有婁子匡巧女和同獃娘故事的搜集。此書編制甚佳，文字雖係　集，亦多加修飾；書後附編者對此類故事的探討一篇，給了民間故事研究者不少的方便。獃娘之部裏的麵人篇，在我們四川也有這樣的故事。我的祖母常向我擺這個龍門陣。只記得最後是獃娘的哭訴：「你今朝也要我做人，明朝也要我做人，做出人來人打人！」巧女之部裏的付酒錢篇和兩句口頭禪篇都是屬於「代解圍式」的，不知何故要把這兩篇隔得這樣遠，而其他知諱九和解難題等却又放在一起。一百兩銀子和三月裏回家這兩篇也是同式的，也應放在一起；論文中本是將這兩篇都歸入明圖信式的。與這一式相反的故事，我在蕪湖時曾見太平府的一個老婆婆說起過，大意謂一巧女寫信給她的丈夫，不能書，便以圖代之，上繪龜三隻，鵝一隻，鵝口中書線三條，三又而引長之，意思是：」歸不歸？不歸我就要「嫁，嫁，嫁」！」付酒錢和兩句口頭禪在笑林廣記卷二上已有著錄，題作口頭語：一把弟兄都有口頭語，把兄愛說「豈有此理，」把弟愛說「那有這麽件事」。把兄與把弟曰：「我兩人這口頭語應該改一改。自今日爲始，如果誰說，罰錢兩串米二斗。」把弟說：「很好」。第二日，把兄來找把弟，一見面，把兄說：「了不得，昨晚失了盜。」·把弟說：「失了何物？」答曰：「被賊把後院井偷去了」。把弟說：「那有這麽件事。」把兄說：「口頭語。罰你罰你。明日一早來取錢米」。把弟懊悔而回，見了婦人，愁眉不展。婦人問曰：「你今日回家，如何這樣愁煩？」丈夫說：「我犯了口頭語，輪給把兄錢二千，米二斗。明日就要來取，因此愁煩」。婦人說：「我到有一個主意。你明日一早裝死。我把你停在門板上，用紙蓋好。把兄來了，我有道理」。丈夫應允。次日如法裝死。把兄一早就來呌門。婦人開門，將兄讓進，掩面假哭。把兄看見房中停屍，弟婦在旁啼哭，忙問：「把弟在那裏？婦人說：「昨日回家，走至院中，被鴨子一脚踼死人」。把兄說：「豈有此理！」把弟在紙裡翻身爬起，大聲呼曰：「不該，不該！」」金絲貓的故事我在紹興布業會館看過嵊縣」的篤班」的演唱。那末，其流傳區域嵊縣也可以列在表内了。巧女和獃娘的故事，在商務文言本的格林童話集時諧裡頗有不少，希望子匡暇時能夠翻檢一下。失望  任本源陽光漸漸爬過屋簷，照到坐在堦石上的四福的臉上，暖和而發癢的；究屬初夏時節了，穿着夾襖有點嫌熱。今天他兒子小寳上城去賣絲，他呆呆的在等着他回來。五月賣新絲，本是非常吃虧的事，在經騐豐富的四福心中，何嘗會不曉得，可是葉行的葉賬，倘不如期歸淸，來年賒葉，便不能得到人家的信任，事實逼迫，不得已要『挖肉補　』！好在四福的　還好，每十斤繭能做十四兩絲，在　年稅荒得狠的當中，有這樣的成績，可算十分徼倖而可欣喜的想到由蟻　到上簇的辛勤；天保佑地能平順的繅絲去賣，佈滿皺紋的臉上，不覺露出一絲快樂的微笑。今年想來會寛裕點了。小寳可來了，埀頭喪氣的，背上包裹依舊背着，眞使四福十分詫異。『怎的，仍舊背轉家來，難道絲行還沒開秤嗎？』『不』，小寳搖了搖頭將包裹輕輕的放在堦　石上，『因爲粗細不匀，不要！』『那麽價錢可再賤一點，這是他們殺窮漢的時節，你不要板住不賣啊，倘如往年，這樣的絲那會······』『我沒板價錢，他們只說現在不要，等到下半年再說。』『呵！下半年，那等得到啊。』四福眉頭緊皺在一起，發呆的望着那包絲，一想到葉行收賬先生的嚴厲面孔，便不禁悠然的嘆了口氣：『明天讓我自已去懇懇情看。』但明天的結果能會比今天好嗎？創作小說平凡的事  𣽃果孫不久，他認爲自已已經看明了塲上的風向，於是從衣裝裏面從從容容掏出錢來下注了······忽然桌上那隻呌人鐘樣的鈴子狄伶地響了，末了，那個坐在桌子中段邊的做手」，把那隻鑲在桌子中央的黑色圓盤裏面的輪形短柱，用手忒侖地一旋，立刻就看見了一粒來踪不明的象牙珠子，在圓盤裏面滴溜溜地跑起來了。約莫經過了十多秒鐘，這粒珠子才在那個早由財神或者窮神所預先在盤裡派定的號碼格子裡面停住不動，於是牠就以雙料的代表資格來支配大衆的輸贏了。豋時，這條長桌的綠呢桌衣上面，發生一陣由木材或者由金屬所生的摩擦或撞擊的輕微聲浪，於是這粒珠子，算是向當塲的男男女女，盡了一幕的使命，一幕由財神或者窮神所定派定的使命，兩三分鐘之後，第二幕又開始來了，於是前一幕裡所現過的那些必然動作，又一步一步跟着再現一回············這樣後一幕跟着前一幕不住而來的現象，在雍孫的眼眶裏面眞不曉得過了幾千百回了，他却曉得這是一個强而頑的魔力圈，跳到了圈子裏面誰也打牠不破，然而他又曉得這個勢力圈之那些跳進去了的人是有擒有縱地恩威並用的，於是他心裏就慢慢地發生一種自信力，以爲自已很有把握去趨恩避威。但是，結果，他的財產和光陰，已經在這個比較新的魔力圈裏很消耗了一大部分子。他固然也明白這種消耗的趨勢於他並沒有何等進益，但是他却有相當的理由呌他不想跳出這個圈子他常常說：『錢和光陰，究竟是小事；要緊的，就是要能　常常有許多朋友來安慰我，除了「二百八十一號」那類的地方，我眞沒有機會可以找朋友，沒有機會可以撞見新朋友！所以我非常常去走走不行！』在事實上，雍孫的生活裏的枯燥孤寂的成分本來很多：以家庭方面而論，元配成夫人早已去世，自已和一個抓着他不肯放手的外室同居，那外室不僅是一個三十多歲的人，並且還一天到晚閙着要扶歪扶正；兒子呢，大的就是伯唐，出繼長房，久已獨立門户，以營造工程師的身分，設了一家名呌長興的大規模營造公司，在上海很有一點名氣，小的是呌叔晉，是個還未成家的大學生，他自從喪母以來就住伯唐家裏。像這樣一個内部的新舊高低很不調和的畸形家庭，雍孫當然是無從享受。至於社交方面，他當然也有過很多的知交，不過回爲他的財產過豐，秉性厚，目光過近，所以那些知交完全是上海式的。他們遇着要沾雍孫的光的時候就是朋友，若是偶爾受到時代輪子的推移，得了意外的進展，就把雍孫丢在腦後，或者遭了意外的失敗，也就不敢上門。這樣，就是說雍孫的知交們儘管有一個時代一個時代的不同，而其在物質上不能和雍孫長期保存水平則一：他們非進卽退非升卽降的事實是顯然的，而雍孫却始終勉强站在那塊慢慢　耗慢慢陸沉的面積廣大的粘土上面。所以倘若他把三五個月不到上海的各處公共塲所裏面去頑頑，他一定很容易失掉他心裏的那些知交，變成一個有子孫有姬妾並且有黑牌汽車可坐的孤零零的中年人了。</p>

<p>春秋福氣人  花鈴　　自古道，「上有天堂，下有蘇杭」，直把蘇杭抬上三十三天。其實蘇州就不過出幾節「嫩塘藕」，杭州就不過生幾條「黃瓜兒」，希甚麽罕。惟有「不耕而食，不織而衣」的上海，才可算得天堂而無愧。上海，沒有一畦水田，一方耕地，但特别頭號「機器上白米」，却從沒打過饖荒。不栽一根麥桿子，而雪白的麵粉，供給山東老　做「麵條兒」，綽有餘裕。　　沒有「桑田」，但「巴黎緞」，「印度綢」，「杭縐」，「盛紡」，式式都有。沒有「瓜田」，而一年四季，「東瓜」，「西瓜」，「北瓜」，都會應時上市、。　　不只衣食受用，「住」，也是獨步中華。守古派，可住太陽廟的「茅屋」，維新派，可住霞飛路的「洋房」，從水國來的，可住「　艄船」，從高原來的，可住「三層攔」。　　說起了行，更是有福。紅毛鬼造「汽車」，「電車」，倒給上海人受用。若不愛這一手，那麽，還有駕着人拉的黃包車。高興起來說這太不人道，跴開兩腿在大馬路，四馬路上踱，碰來碰去，都是「肉感富豐」的好嬌娘。衣食住行，色色都好，提到「女人」，更是　福不淺。「蘇州頭，揚州脚」，自然是遐邇馳名的，在上海，「俚倷俚倷」的「蘇州小娘俉」。「拉塊垃塊」的「揚州大姑娘」，應有盡有。紅衣綠袴的北方　女，袒胸露足的南國佳人，更無一或缺。　　若愛異國情調，那麽，從「地中海」來的，從「新大陸」來的，從印度來的，從俄國來的，從「歐州大陸來的，從」「扶桑三島」來的，村村俏俏，都說一個「戀愛自由」，好在上海人，又是實際上沒有國籍的，所以儘「檢愛的抓」，不會鬧亂子。　　這些福氣，是走遍天下，都找不到的，所以每個「上海人」，都有鵝蛋大的一個星宿。笑！  錢澐　　不交朋友，只是可恨的朋友太多了；我想你有幾個的，在恨他，氣他，惜乎不曾實行打他，愈是沒有打過，愈覺這股氣好悶，滿肚腹轉！幸得有時向下面的洩出，實在當你未能下洩，正不妨上宣，不管他人感覺行這如下洩一般的臭，且駡他一個天翻地覆；然後才屬衛生之道！　　是的，你見了朋友太酒肉化，你知道這些朋友無所謂帮助；更談不到熱心，他們告訴你的不過祇給你一支紙烟，你就恨吧？你或者恨到想去打他，可憐呀！你。　　他們老是這樣會和了你一陣子笑，他們會把你肩上灰屑除掉，甚至他們會給蓋糞；但你不能不給與酒和肉，不給與嗎？······他把灰屑吹進你的眼睛，把蓋着的糞塞到你嘴裏，他們還是笑，笑得聲音低，笑得聲音斷斷續續，如病人臨死的囑咐。　　於時··你的臉現悲哀，你的訴苦開始，你太嘮叨吧？那個朋友知道後獰笑說··倒你媽一百年霉，接着把雪茄烟灰一彈，兩隻肥肉的肩頭一聳，似乎還痰嗽一聲丨嚯丨搭。　　那時無疑地你一生給你這位朋友看到透底了，·········就是··從此你的說話聽不到，你的人影他看不見，更不論肩上有灰屑，說什麽打他，即如撞死在面前，他管你咧！倒是暗地駡他，還是你的衛生，得以苟延了一生！滅臭蟲的靈方  茸餘　　都市沒有昔草地，沒有水潭，所以也沒有蚊蟲。不過臭蟲的攻擊，也夠你受用。　　臭蟲的抵抗力眞大，冷熱不怕；熏澆不斃；餓不死；撲不凈。它的蕃殖力，好像孫行者拔一撮毫毛，變成了千百小猴子。三天不捉，天花板内，地板縫裏，床·凳·桌·椅，滿是它們的世界。現在出售的撲滅臭蟲藥，靈麽？比江湖出賣的跳虱藥，當然靈一些。因爲跳虱藥的功効，只有幽默的意味，沒有實際的本領，不信！你看下列一段話··　　有出賣跳虱藥的，人問他靈不靈？他說··怎麽不靈，祇要把跳虱捉住，張開它的嘴巴，把藥灌進走，它會不死的麽？　　你想一個跳虱給你捉住，它還有活的道理麽？何况還要灌些藥進去，當然是必死無疑，那末他的藥不靈而靈了。　　臭蟲藥只有麻醉的功効，沒有撲殺的能力，那是美中不足。我從前住在上海的亭子間裏，在臨睡的時候，把藥粉在蓆底下洒上一大圈，果然一夜安眠，么魔不擾。明天你不洒藥粉，仍是要跋扈跳梁，吮吸你的脂膏。我一想那不得了，一瓶藥粉要幾毛錢，洒不上二三天便完了，一個月下來，豈不是比房錢還貴麽。於是天天搜捉，隔上二三天，把火油開水，澆抺一遍。眞靈！一枕高眠，非到天亮不醒，後來那亭子間裏，臭蟲竟然絶跡。　　來！革命的同志擁擠，時代反而開起倒車來了！不過關於醫療人體病的方法，現在總算已有進步，關於醫療社會病的方法，幾時才能希望它有進步呢？　　從前有一個愛賭的人，　　士以常賭常勝的方法。術士寫上一個密封給他，呌他拿回去看。他回家去拆開一看，原來是「不賭在　　我可不賣這個關子，拿最靈的方法公布出來，便是「勤捉」二字。怕臭蟲咬的人，不妨試他一下，决不上當！密蜂的剌  醉痴生　　胸前雙峯，是女子美妙的寶藏，莫怪要引起男子們的覬觎。夏令，爲女子表演「曲線美」最興奮的時期。從前男妇多以女子爲玩物，現在女子往往以男女爲玩物，這大約也是「物極必反」的緣故。　　文明極了，反要趨於野　，有等新人物，提倡「男女裸體運動，」就是文明太過的毛病。　　摩登女子，最講「儉德。」有時會把褲子和襪，都省去不用。　　摩登女子，又好似「預言家」。伊們曉得今年將有「水災」發生，所以都預先赤了脚等待着。病  閻重樓　　病對於人，也是一椿重大而痛苦的事。　　由於飲食的不愼，思想的不安，行動的反常，構成各式各樣的病。有些人患病幸而很輕，經過醫生的療治得以痊愈。有些人染病不幸很重，百藥妄效就此長眠。　　「病」是有階級性的，富人生病，只望病好，醫藥費的多寡是絶不計較的。窮人生病，不但起碼的醫藥費要發生問題，恐怕因病者失業廢時，還會使他的一家人都餓起肚皮來呢。所以「起死回生」雖是迷信欺人之談，但可說「病」到富人的身上，總是比較容易痊愈！　　　　生理上會發生各種的病態，社會上也會發生各種的病態，請看沉淪，掙扎，爭鬥，流血······一切的罪惡在現代的社會上進展着，其猛烈實不下於生理上病態的流行。　　都市的醫生過剩，病者倒反而增加起東北四連長  張恨水第十回　　聞語警芳心封侯願渺　　聽　現羨色報國身　　　他們坐的三輛人力車子，正拉不上前，這後面却來了一輛汽車，按着喇叭嗚嗚亂響。黃曼英呌道··得了得了，我們下來罷，别爲了省兩步路，讓汽車撞死。三個人在汽車疑縫裏跳下車來時，後面那汽車上的人，也下車了。下來的是一男一女，年歲都不大。那個女的，忽然呌起來道··密斯黃。曼英回頭看到了，笑道··原來是密斯柳。你是聽戲來着，我們也是來聽戲的呀。密斯枊道··戲館子裏見罷。說話時，他已經生進戲館子裏去了。曼英三人跟着進去，找到了座位，抬起頭來看時，却向西樓頭級包廂裏的人，點了幾點頭。桂枝看時，便是那個密斯枊。他穿了一件杏黃色的綢料旗袍，在灰鼠大衣裏面，微微的露出一些衣襟來。頭上的頭髮，　着蓬得高高的，兩個耳朶下亮晶晶的有兩粒珠子大的東西，在那裏搖擺不定。這樣東西，一猜就着，知道是鑽石耳墜子。同時他抬起一隻手來摸頭髮，又露出手指上一粒亮晶晶的戒指來。那個男人坐在他身邊，也就不過三十上下，西裝平平直直的穿在身上，一點皺紋沒有。只是有一層和别的摩登少年不同，頭上的頭髮，却剪得光秃秃的露了頂。他們那個包廂的欄干上，吃的喝的，烟捲筒子，水果碟子，茶壼茶杯，襬了一大長行。身後有兩個穿軍衣的，直挺挺的站着。桂枝料着那個女子，並不是女學生，不然，何以滿臉都擦的胭脂粉。可是黃曼英又呌密斯枊是什麽原故呢？他們女學生互相稱呼，不都是呌着密斯嗎？那末，他一個人爲什麽獨穿得這樣闊？（一二○）短篇小說嘔（下）  天恨生　　「我我曉得這房子不能住，你一定要租，不是有意要我的命麽？我現在是每天要嘔好幾次，嗅着了也是嘔，想着了也是嘔，把心肝五臟都嘔出來了！，你也吃這個自來水管裡的水呢，水與小便幾乎混和在一起，能吃不能吃？」　　程先生正想阻止伊要說這個話，忽聽得「噁噁噁」之聲，伊竟又噁起來要嘔了。伊實在不能想，也實在是每天總要嘔好幾次，伊一說到「水與小便混和在一起，」就彷彿鼻子裏嗅着了惡臭，眼睛襄看見水與小便混和在一起，同時渾身的寒毛一竪，打個寒噤，似乎心裏就泛起了水與小便，胃子反過來，止不住大嘔，嘔得已隻眼睛變爲赤紅。程先生趕忙站起來扶着伊，等伊嘔過了，扶上床睡下，也沒有别的話安慰伊，只是說：　　「趕緊搬罷！」　　」搬！」程夫人好似因嘔更加重了怒：「今天晚上就搬都嫌遲，你還要等到住滿了這個月　搬呢！横竪我已在這個房子裡弄成這樣，霍亂是免不了有我的份；你歡喜住這房子，就永遠住下去罷！」　　「你也說得奇！不找定新房子，如何好搬呢？我勸你以後不要想着水就聯帶想着小便，自然便不不嘔。」　　程先生雖這樣勸，程夫人終不能想到水不聯帶想到小便，還是一天嘔上好幾次。程先生沒法，而且自已也忍受不住這惡臭，便出去找房子，决定再過五天就搬塲。那知在未搬前又竟應了程夫人的話，患了霍亂；同屋的房客先後被傳染了兩男一婦。二房東的第二個兒子也在程夫人患病的第三天上患了同樣的病。　　程夫人與同病的兩男一婦都曾注射過預防針，一發作，就抬到醫院裡求治。據醫生診視結果：程夫人竟是假霍亂；兩男一婦也有兩人不是眞霍亂；而且也都注射過預防針，都在醫院裡治愈了。　　二房東夫婦都不停仰醫院，自然更不信打針就可以預防。兒子病了，他也曉得是時症，但絶不肯送往醫院求治。醫院在他們夫婦的腦筋裡，彷彿是一座可怕的惡獸，人從醫院的大門抬進去，就彷彿被恶獃吃進了肚裡去一般。他們只信任挑痧的老李。　　於是他們就手忙脚亂的去尋老李。他們倒還有點相信痧藥水，在老李未到前，臨時救急的辦法就是給痧藥水病兒；他們以爲痧藥水吃下去就會止嘔止瀉的，吃下去不止，就繼續再吃，在老李挾了一個小包兒進來時，痧藥水已吃掉一瓶了。　　老李雖不穿長衫，但行路的姿勢，很有穿着長衫，並且加穿了一件馬褂的神氣。他走上樓梯，突然有一股惡臭，觸入鼻觀，也不禁打了一個噁心，縐了一縐眉頭。　　二房東太太一看見老李，就說：「好了！老李來了！請你趕快挑一針罷！痧藥水不行。」　　老李仍從容不迫的走。但在看見阿土仍在嘔瀉，和兩個眼睛已經陷下去，又見指螺都已　下去的時候，却也暗吃一驚。不過再一想到阿水也病得這般模樣，結果仍活在世上時，膽就大了許多。　　站在一旁的二房東忽然問道「阿土怎麽會得這個病的呢？老李！可要緊麽？」　　「這個麽？唔！」老李支吾着。但他不能不答出一種「所以得這個病」的原因來，維持他的地位。他靈機一動，想起那一股惡臭便說：　　「夏天要潔凈，你們樓梯旁的自來水怎麽會有那樣臭呢？吃了不潔凈的水，就會生病」。　　「唔！」二房東也支吾起來了！</p>

<p>談言現代靑年應有的責任  厚英　　最近有一個消息，尙可以安慰我這個幾乎沒有完全死去的心，我們大槪還沒有忘記最近幾星期來，報紙上所載的二個靑年因愛國而至跳海自殺的新聞吧？雖氏這並不像東北義勇軍那樣使我們心中痛快，雖然他們跳海自殺的動機，或者也不是完全出於「愛國」，但是這樣一來，能夠令我們相信中國靑年的熱血還沒有到個個人冰冷的程度，總是眞的了，然而我對於他們的愛國熱忱，雖然是非常的欽佩，可是他們的「投海救國」方法，我却不敢贊同，須知現代的靑年，尤其是像這種有愛國心兼且受過敎育的靑年，更應當切切實實地替國家替人民做一番事業，我們中國目前是苦命的了，但是我們可不能任他永遠的苦命過去，以至滅亡，我們的靑年丨中國的主人翁丨他們應該揮發出少壯的精神來，共同恊力負起這個「千斤重擔」，他們旣然是主人翁，他們應該要知道一個主人翁有什麽責任，他們對於怎樣履行他們的責任，必須時時加以積極的練習，正如一個游泳家，練習他的游泳技術一樣，雖然他已經輸給人家幾次了，但是决賽尙沒有臨到，他能夠拚命練習，安知不能打敗人家呢？近來似乎提倡「國貨救國」以及「航空救國」的聲浪很高，這當然也是一種救國的準備，但是我以爲這並不是從根本上做起的準備，所以我們不妨在「航空救國」和「國貨救國」之餘，同時也可以試試看進行下面這二個「基本的救國準備」，我相信這不僅對於一般慒懂的靑年們是有莫大的效果，便是對於沉淪在「迷惑」裏面的靑年們，也可說是一個有統系的貢獻，祇要他們能「實行，」　　㈠應該有强健的體格雖然現在是物質文明的世界了，任你有何等强健的身體，我只要一柄小小的手槍，便能置你死命，但是，這究竟是偏於一方面的話，須知我們必定要先有强健的體格，方才能有精神辦理各種偉人的事業，方始能終日勞碌而不至疲倦，我們「應該有一個强健的體格」，在參加一切救國工作之前，他非但能夠增加你的智慧，他並且還能給你「百折不回」的精神，「耐苦堅持」的毅力，你有沒有聽見過，一個病夫曾經作出什麽大事業來，我可以說「沒有」，因爲他的精神不容許他，　　㈡應該有一切普通的學識孫總理說道：「革命的基礎在有高深的學問」，我們中國目前，當然不能個個人都有高深的學問，而且我們大約也不希望在短時間内有如許良好的成績，我以爲我們中國現在只要每個公民，每個靑年，都能有一切普通的學識，國事就决不會弄得如此糟糕了，試觀，奸商，漢奸，僞軍，他們差不多都是沒有一些學問的，他們因爲沒有學問，就不知道國家，而只認得金錢，所以我們第二個問題，「應該每個人都有一切普通的學識」，　　㈢應該有完美的道德我們中國從前據說是最注重道德的，但是近年來，却一敗塗地，不要說一切游民的堕落是日甚一日，便是大都市中有正當職業（？）的靑年們，也都大多數缺少道德觀念，他們以爲「道德」兩字已是十八世紀的名詞了，誠不知「道德」乃是人生最重要的一件，當我們獲得了「强健的體格」與「一切普通學識」之後，倘使我們忘記了「道德」，我相信這個國家是會比沒有「啓發民智」以前亡得快的，因爲他們學了一些較高深的本領，而並不走上正當的軌道，那麽，一旦作起惡來比沒有本領的人更加厲害，所以我們一面敎育他們的智識，一面更需加倍的養成他們的「完美的道德」像，戒除一切不良的習慣，修養光明正大的心地，不要有自私自利的念頭，努力走上正義的大路，在這時候，他們當然不會再貪圖金錢而致背棄祖國作出不道德的事情來，便是社會上，盜賊游民等也必定要少得多了，　　㈣應該每日閱報我想你假使是一個有思想的靑年，你必然不會因别的不要緊的娛樂而擔誤你閱報的時間的，而且你要做一個摩登的，現代的靑年，你也必須閱報，在報章裏，牠能告訴你國内大事，時事新聞，國際現狀，以及目前的商業等市面，和靑年堕落的原因，這許多都是一個現代靑年所應有的智識，你不要誤會注重「道德」的人是十八世紀的頭腦，惟有不知道現代時勢的方才是已經過去的靑年，我們要做一個站在時代前面的靑年，我們要做一個領導羣衆的靑年，我們「應該每日閱報」，藝文寄東北義勇軍  尹澄宇　　東北羣雄死不休，揭竿紛起殺邦　，磨刀陷陣斬千敵，怒喊衝鋒動六洲，黑水怎悲嗚流血海，遼山慘暗積屍邱，何愁未捷身先沒，長使芳名百民留，　　又鐵爲肌骨石爲肝，知死無生赴國難，刀劍夜光邊月白，旌旗盡重朔風寒，烟塵北地呼相助，歌無南京樂苟安，願與九州同濟客，中流共起救狂瀾，店員通訊傅宗接代　　編輯先生：　　我是一個剛從紹興來滬的人，沒有親戚，也沒有好友，简直是人地生疏，舉目無親。現在雖在一個錢莊裏做了一個店員，可是同事們都自以爲是一個一老上海」，對於一個鄕下人，看輕得什麽似的；所以非但不能將我胸中的疑難的問題，與他們的商量，就是平日之間的談話，亦不過大家敷衍一下子罷了。每天看見貴報通信欄，承編輯先生婉言答覆，不禁使我感到諸位編輯先生好似恩人似的，所以我才敢拿起筆來，將我所謂一個難題，傾吐於貴編輯先生面前，同時希望貴編輯先生指敎答覆。　　在十六歲那年，我在一個故鄕的縣立初中畢了業，自幼就喜歡求學的我，一意便再想升學。可是我的父親，是個舊禮敎的信徒，他以爲兒子若讀書讀得高了，便會忘記父母，便會家庭革命，這個念頭緊緊地纒着他的腦海，所以决計呌我輟學，送我到一個錢莊裏去學生意，並在次年强逼我同一個同鄕女子結了婚。雖然我們是素不相識，幸而是情投意合，一直到了現在，已是六年了。在這六年中，我們並沒有生育一次；而望孫心切，染着家族觀念的父母，便要我討小老婆。我覺得我們夫婦倆的感情旣投合，而且在這樣年輕的我，並且還沒有充分能分，來維持家庭的我，沒有兒子生，是幸福，更談不到討小婆？可是父母親生，太不諒解，生太固執，說是我不討小老婆，便是不聽父母的命令；不聽父母命令，便是大逆不道，於是就把我和我的妻趕出了。我們在親戚家裏住幾天，幸而承友人的介紹，我才有今日的一個區區的職使，然而我的妻子還依舊住在親戚家裏，因爲終究是經濟的關係，不能接她到上海來。而且岳家本是貧寒，平是之間，常賴我的父親去供給，現在，我們尙且不能得到父親的供給，更何况岳家呢？所以我爲萬全計，不得不想個辦法，就是想到育嬰堂去抱一個；假說是我們自已生出來的。這樣我們旣可得一份家產，而岳家亦得以救濟，同時我們夫婦亦得以住在一處，一舉三得，實是美事所難者，即育嬰堂，未知在何處？這點希望編輯先生告知，同時更希望貢獻些意見，關於我這個辦法對否？陳昌年拜啓　　ＸＸＸＸ　　編者按：令尊的這種過份重視宗祧的觀念，在理論上，不免有說不過去的地方；因爲要孫子的緣故，連兒子都可以不要；皮之不存，毛將安附呢！不過反轉來一想，這也是人情之常；就是賢伉儷之間，在不久的將來，恐怕也也感到要有兒女的必要。一個人在三十四五歲以前，似乎以爲有了夫婦之愛，一切都不成問題；但是一到四十以外，便誰都會需要兒了。等到五十以外，單有子媳，又會感到不能滿足，而想要有孫子了。這種觀念，雖說不合情理，但是這種老年人，定見頗深，你想用言語去勸解，是不中用的。你現在想將錯就錯，未始不可。子女之於父母，不過似芝蘭玉樹，生於庭階，正不必爭其誰人所出也。至於育嬰堂，據我們所知，上海小南門内有一所；此外在北火車站北首，也有一所；好在這種慈善機關，到那裏便一問就着的。自我職業介紹　　丨此欄來稿請逕寄本報業餘周刋收丨　　蔣君，現肄業交通在學，願於課餘，擔任家庭敎師或他職，薪資不計，如合需求，請投函徐家滙海格路海格里五十五號葉周城君收轉，如有暑假期間工作，更願効力。　　朱君，國立交通大學肄業，能敎授高級數學及理化，願任暑期家庭補習敎師，志在利用暑假，謀中學生之幸福，通信處本報業餘周刋轉。　　某君，年三十歲，商科大學畢業，曾任公司助理員，機關書記，對於英文打字，中西簿記，均極熟嫻，現欲服務社會，或個人秘書，薪金四十元，需供宿膳，來信寄愚園路，四明别墅二十三號，沈湯姆轉。　　石季春君，廣東人，年二十四歲，通中英文，畢業香港聖保羅書院，曾任中學英文敎員，及報館編輯，現願任初中英文敎員，公館英文敎師，或報館雜誌助理編輯，月薪三十元，欲聘者請投函本報業餘周刋社轉。　　張君，大學畢業，願任高中程度國英文公館敎授，通訊處本報業餘周刋轉。　　故慧女士，江蘇上海人，二十六歲，大學畢業，擅長英國算，現願任銀行，洋行，報館，學校，或公館敎授，薪金不計，通訊處，本報業餘周刋轉。　　張宏德君，上海人，年二十八歲，粗通文字，熟悉租界内路徑，有殷實舗保，願任勞動職務，或助手均可，住宿自備，薪資不計，通信處美租界天潼路一九三弄十八號楊順興行轉。　　瑪美女士，粤人，在　程度，能操英語國語滬語，精英文打字及簿記，願任家庭敎師，洋行，公司，報館等之打字員及抄寫員，通訊處本報業餘周刋轉。　　可聿　君　年十九歲，浙江鄞縣人，肄業於滬江大學醫學院，因日間　事，願任公司職員，或初中及高級小學英算等科敎員，薪金不計，通訊處本埠北山　路康樂里六號。　　施雪誼君，浙江湖州人，年二十二，擅長中文及華文打字，茲願任報館書局校對，私人書記，或公館庶務員，薪金不計，通訊處法租界西門路二百號大亞　報轉。</p>

<h3 id="e2">Denying Rumors of a Stalled Conference <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the disposition of the puppet troops in eastern Luan, Xue Zhiheng and others went to Dalian to discuss the matter with the Kwantung Army and Li Jichun, among others. However, due to the cunning attitude of the Japanese side, two demands were suddenly raised: (1) Each county in eastern Luan, as well as Zunhua County, Miyun, and Suyi, must be equipped with 500 Japanese troops to monitor our actions. The majority of these troops would then be withdrawn to the vicinity of the Great Wall, and the security of the war zone would be entirely maintained by Li Jichun's forces. Our police are not allowed to enter. (2) The section of the Beining Railway from Lutai to Shanhaiguan will be managed by a joint Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo committee. After receiving a report from our representatives yesterday, the Beiping authorities have forwarded it to Nanjing and Jiangxi for instructions on how to respond and telegraphed Xue and others to remain in Dalian for nearby negotiations. However, due to this setback, all war zone takeover plans must be temporarily suspended. All pre-arranged measures cannot be implemented until the Japanese side shows sincerity. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese demand to station a portion of their troops in the war zone to monitor troops is a clear violation of the Tanggu Truce Agreement, which our side finds difficult to accept. The establishment of a joint Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo committee to manage the Beining Railway is tantamount to a disguised recognition of the puppet state, which is even more impossible. Therefore, the takeover of the war zone and the resolution of the puppet troop issue have been temporarily stalled. It is speculated that the Japanese are using the pretext of maintaining the security of the puppet state to deploy troops within the Great Wall line, with the aim of further invading North China.</p>
<p>(4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Affairs Commission issued a correction on the 4th, stating that the rumors of a stalled Dalian conference were incorrect. It was confirmed that on the 4th, representatives from both sides in Dalian were further studying the drafted outline for resolving the puppet troop issue. Our representatives did not respond at the time to the Japanese proposal to set up monitoring troops and for the three parties to manage the Beining Railway, promising to request instructions from the authorities. It is heard that the two matters will be decided at the Tanggu conference. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Dalian) The Chinese side has rejected the participation of "Manchukuo" in discussions on the policing of the Beining Railway after the withdrawal of Japanese troops, as the Chinese side fundamentally refuses to recognize the existence of "Manchukuo". Currently, the conference is discussing the issue of incorporating the volunteer army within the non-formal combat areas, as well as the restoration of traffic on the Beining Railway. The Kwantung Army has indicated that the progress of the conference is quite smooth, and Okamura has also stated that the Japanese army is currently withdrawing from the Beining Railway. The progress of the conference is quite secret, and news reporters are generally not allowed to enter. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Tongzhou states that in the counties east of Ping, with the exception of a small number of Japanese troops stationed in areas such as Jixian, Shangcang, and Xiacang, the majority of the Japanese and puppet troops have now been transferred to the east of the Luan River. The magistrate of Jixian County has not yet returned to his post. Currently, a committee member appointed by Li Jichun is stationed in the city, instigating merchants and civilians to establish an autonomous association. Due to the rampant bandits within the territory, the people are living in misery. Although the committee member is making every effort to instigate them, most people are ignoring him.

<p>(Beiping) A dispatch from Lutai states that the puppet troops in eastern Lutai have not yet withdrawn. Li Jichun's headquarters is located in the elementary school at the East Tangshan Station. Zhao Lei is stationed in Tangshan City, and his troops are also stationed near Tangshan. The Third Brigade of the puppet army in Ninghe, led by Cheng Guofeng, is stationed in the city. The Fourth Brigade of the puppet army, originally stationed in the city and led by Zhang Hanchen, has been transferred to Fengtai Town, northeast of Ninghe. Zheng Yanhou, the deputy commander of the puppet army, led more than 50 of his troops from Tangshan to the Changli area to suppress bandits. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Today, the House of Commons discussed the activities of puppet troops in the neutral zone of North China. Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Eden stated that he now knows that the railway between Tangshan and Lutai is an area occupied by puppet troops. The current authorities have taken the necessary steps to deal with this matter. There is no danger to British expatriates in the areas of Beidaihe, Qinhuangdao, and Shanhaiguan, so no special protective measures have been taken for them. (3rd Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Unifying the Telecommunications Industry in the Northeast</p>
<p>Establishing a Joint Japanese-Manchukuo Communications Company</p>
<p>(Beiping) In order to unify the telecommunications industry in the entire Northeast and facilitate control and command, the Japanese side has decided to organize a joint Japanese-Manchukuo communications company. Committees will be appointed by the Kwantung Army, the Kwantung Government General Telecommunications Bureau, and the South Manchuria Railway. Lieutenant General Shizutomo Yamauchi will be appointed as the chairman of the committee. The total capital is set at 50 million Japanese yen, with the telecommunications equipment of the Kwantung Government General valued at 16.5 million yen and the equipment of the puppet state of Manchukuo valued at 6 million yen. The remainder will be raised separately. The outline of the business is to include all wired and wireless communications, telephone, photography, broadcasting, and all ancillary businesses in the Kwantung Leased Territory, the South Manchuria Railway's affiliated areas, and throughout Manchukuo. The agreement to establish the company has been approved. On May 15th, Xie Jieshi and Mutō Nobuyoshi exchanged documents at the Manchukuo Administrative Council to establish the committee. The committee has a total of 15 members, with the Japanese accounting for the majority. After the full committee convenes in June, it will begin to carry out the company's business. Japan now has another institution for invading the Northeast. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

Because the 100,000 yuan departure fee promised by Chiang is far from sufficient, he specifically telegraphed the Beiping authorities to prepare two months' worth of military pay and provisions, totaling approximately 440,000 yuan. Sun's 120th Brigade recently defeated over 700 bandits in Kangzhuang, who have fled towards Dolon. After being reorganized by Sun, Liu's 4,000-plus troops are currently stationed in Yan County, intensifying training. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>Liu Sheng Cables the Central Government Requesting the Dispatch of Personnel to Xinjiang for Investigation</p>
<p>(Nanjing) This area has received a telegram from Dihua stating that Xinjiang Provincial Government Secretary-General Tao Mingyue, Frontier Defense Headquarters Chief of Staff Chen Zhong, and Aviation Department Director Li Xiaotian, in liaison with a certain high-ranking official, intended to overthrow the current situation of Liu Wenlong and Sheng Shicai and reorganize the provincial government, supporting a certain high-ranking official as chairman and abolishing the Frontier Defense Headquarters to establish a military commission. After Liu Sheng discovered evidence of this and believed it was disrupting the frontier situation, he arrested and executed Tao and the other two by firing squad, and telegraphed the Central Government requesting the dispatch of Chen Lifu, Liu Guang, Peng Zhaoxian, Zhang Fengjiu, and the other four to Xinjiang to investigate the truth of the Xinjiang incident in order to clarify the facts. The relevant parties have forwarded the original telegram to the Central National Government's Executive Yuan, and Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang has requested instructions on how to handle it. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Before departing, Xinjiang Envoy Huang Musong originally only took on the role of envoy and was unwilling to preside over Xinjiang. With the incident of the execution of three key figures in Xinjiang, Huang, in order to show his frankness and to consolidate border defense, telegraphed Chairman Lin, President Wang, and Chairman Chiang, recommending Liu Wenlong as the chairman of Xinjiang Province and Sheng Shicai as the border defense commissioner of Xinjiang. Wang has telegraphed Chiang to discuss this and will submit it to the next Executive Yuan meeting. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Xinjiang Border Defense Commissioner's Office issued a circular stating that Ma Zhongying disturbed the Hui region last year, and the entire region was devastated. He recklessly wreaked havoc in southern Xinjiang, and recently occupied our Taicheng Fuhuan. After the envoy repeatedly conveyed the central government's peaceful intentions, the rebel resisted and advanced towards Dihua, fiercely attacking our troops. Shicai is duty-bound to defend the territory and resist the enemy, and has ordered an expedition. He subsequently engaged Ma in Kouzi and Hunquan, where Ma was injured and defeated, with hundreds killed or wounded and thousands captured, along with a large number of weapons. Liu Bin, Lieutenant General and Chief of Staff of the Xinjiang Border Defense Commissioner's Office, kowtows. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the incident in Xinjiang, Ma Zhongying took advantage of the emptiness in the rear and led his troops to occupy Hami. He was recently defeated by troops dispatched by Liu Wenlong, the acting chairman of Xinjiang, and Ma's troops have fled into the mountains. Liu telegraphed Wang Zhongying, the newly stationed representative in Beiping, to report. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, He Yingqin invited Song Zheyuan to meet at Jurentang to discuss the situation in Chahar at length, still hoping for a peaceful mediation and seeking another way to resolve it. Tonight, Song summoned Li Xin to his private residence to discuss a final effort regarding the Chahar situation. Ma Boyuan spoke to people about Feng's two points: (1) He hopes that all parties will be candid with each other and hopes for a concrete expression. (2) He has always advocated maintaining Chahar Province.</p>

<p>(Beiping) Efforts are still being made to mediate the Chahar situation. After Li Qi returned to Beiping to report on his negotiations with Feng, the authorities here have telegraphed Nanjing and Jiangxi for instructions. At the same time, they are waiting for Kong Xiangxi to come north. Deng Zhexi, because mediation has not yet been abandoned, is scheduled to come to Beiping from Tianjin tonight to continue mediation. The central government hopes that Yan will engage in mediation.

<p>Rumor Has It That Three Warships Have Defected to Guangdong</p>
<p>But Guangdong Still Denies It</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is generally speculated that the Haiqi and other three warships are likely to defect to Guangdong. It is also heard that Fang Nianzu, the captain of the Haichen warship who previously detained Shen Honglie in Laoshan, acted as an intermediary. The Military Affairs Commission has sent three counselors, Ling Xiao, Liu Tianfu, and Zhang Pengxiao, to Beiping to discuss and mediate with the authorities here and try to summon the three warships back. Zeng Yiding, the commander of the Second Fleet of the Navy, also came to Beiping from Nanjing last night, which is also related to mediating this matter. Chiang is paying close attention to the actions of the defecting warships and has telegraphed various coastal areas to inquire about the whereabouts of the defecting warships. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) More than 20 representatives of the Joint Association to Retain Shen paid a visit to Shen at the municipal government at 10:00 AM on the 4th. As a result, Shen stated that unless the central government has appropriate methods to deal with the situation, he will still find it difficult to withdraw his resignation. Because the representatives' goal was not achieved, they decided to hold another meeting at 7:00 PM. In addition to telegraphing the authorities in Jiangxi, Nanjing, and Beiping, requesting that Shen's resignation not be approved, they sent four representatives to travel west to Nanjing tonight to present everything in person. As for the Haiqi and other warships, according to a report from Jardine Matheson's merchant ship, they passed Wenzhou at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 1st. Based on the mileage, they have reached Guangdong. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Political Council Secretary Xie stated that they have not received a telegram about the Haiqi and other warships coming to Guangdong. If the central government cannot resolve it, it is not certain whether they will come to Guangdong. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Guangdong Navy reports that almost all the personnel on the three warships from Guangdong have been laid off and have no connection with Guangdong. It is unlikely that they will defect to Guangdong in the near future. It is even more inaccurate to say that they have arrived at Dongsha Island, which belongs to Qiongzhou. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) There are also reports that the three warships have arrived in the Rizhao area. The Navy sent Staff Officer Xu to Shidao to comfort them, but he never met them. There has also been no reply to the telegram regarding the mediation with Korea. A telegram from Weihai at 6:00 PM states that the three warships have not arrived in Weihai. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han stated that there is still no confirmed location of the three warships. Yesterday, there were reports that they were on an island 30 miles north of Weihai. He has telegraphed the Yantai Public Security Bureau to investigate and reply. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the three warships of the Bohai Fleet, the Haiqi, Haichen, and Zhaohua, the Executive Yuan received a telegram from the Taikoo Steam Navigation Company stating that the three warships sailed south in succession on the 3rd. Whether they are going to Guangdong is unknown. The government is now trying to persuade them to return to the fleet. It is heard that a wireless message has been sent, persuading them to sail back to Weihai and await disposal. Naval Chief Chen Shaokuan also said that the whereabouts of the Haiqi and other warships have now been discovered, which can prove that they are sailing south and have not defected. However, it seems difficult to calm the situation before the three warships return to the fleet. In order to seek an early resolution, they are currently discussing methods with the Beiping Military Affairs Commission to resolve the matter. According to the British Jardine Matheson steamship company, the three warships were discovered on the waters off Wenzhou and seem to be heading southwest. After receiving the news, the central authorities believe that since the three warships have not defected, they should be treated favorably and have ordered the naval authorities to find ways to intercept them and persuade them to return. However, the central authorities are now quite concerned because the navy south of Wenzhou only has a few warships stationed in Fujian, which are far inferior to the three warships, and it is feared that they may not be able to bring them to submission. Shen believes that the masterminds behind this incident are his students whom he personally trained and taught. The people's hearts are so abnormal that he has sincerely resigned from his current and concurrent positions. The central government has decided to maintain the status quo and telegraphed to retain him before the three warships are intercepted. Chiang Kai-shek also sent a telegram to firmly retain him, but Shen is extremely disheartened and it is feared that it will not be effective. The Executive Yuan will put forward a discussion on the southward sailing of the three warships on the 5th. (4th Special Dispatch)</p>

(4th) (Beiping) The Luan River Bridge was washed away by the water and is currently being repaired. Therefore, many puppet Fengshan Railway vehicles are parked at Tangshan Station. The puppet troops in Tangshan City are all raising the banners of the National Salvation Army.

<p>Negotiations on the Sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<h3 id="e16">Soviet Russia Demands a High Price: The Railway is Priced at 210 Million Rubles <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>Japan Uses Non-Aggressive Mediation as a Threat</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Russian Embassy issued a detailed statement tonight regarding the negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, stating that Soviet Russia is willing to sell all rights to the Chinese Eastern Railway for 210,000,000 gold rubles. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Russo-Manchu conference held yesterday lasted more than five hours. According to a statement released today, the Russian and Manchu representatives presented proposals and their own views on the Chinese Eastern Railway and will discuss them at the plenary meeting on Wednesday. It is heard that the conditions put forward by both sides are far apart, but not irreconcilable. Soviet Russia is now asking for 210,000,000 gold rubles for the railway itself, plus 40,000,000 gold rubles for the transfer of rights to the North Manchurian Soviet Russian timber yards and other facilities related to the railway. "Manchukuo" is giving 50 million Japanese yen, excluding the assets belonging to the railway. (4th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The proposals made by the Russian representatives at the third meeting on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway differed greatly from those of "Manchukuo", namely that the price demanded by the Russian side for the Chinese Eastern Railway and all its ancillary businesses was ten times more than the amount expected by "Manchukuo". Therefore, on the 4th, the two sides studied whether their respective demands were justified in preparation for renegotiation at the next meeting. (4th Joint Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The third meeting on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway opened at 3:30 PM on the 3rd. Lieutenant Colonel Suzuki of Japan and the Director of the First Division of Western Europe and America were present. Today, the Russian Ambassador, Yurenev, chaired the meeting. The Soviet Russian representatives first stated the principled direction of the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, followed by the "Manchukuo" representatives, who also expounded the fundamental principles of purchasing the railway. Afterwards, the two sides discussed various issues until 9:00 PM, when the meeting adjourned. At the same time, the following press release was issued: "At today's meeting, both the Russian and Manchu sides presented proposals and views on the Chinese Eastern Railway issue. These proposals will be reviewed at the next meeting. The next meeting is scheduled to open at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 5th." The meeting also decided to issue a press release after each meeting. (4th Japan Union Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) On the third day of the meeting on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the Russian and Manchu sides presented specific matters and announced the railway prices. Therefore, the meeting was quite tense. Russian Chairman Representative Ambassador Yurenev and other representatives repeatedly spoke to explain the reasonable basis for the Russian proposal. The Manchukuo representatives, Ding Shiyuan and Vice Minister Ōhashi, also explained the Manchurian point of view. The Russian proposal yesterday contained many political elements, and there was a huge disparity in the price of the Eastern Railway claimed by both sides. There are still many twists and turns ahead. (4th Japan Union Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) In the negotiations on the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, the results of the third meeting yesterday showed that there was a large disparity between the opinions of Russia and Manchu. It is expected that there will inevitably be disputes in the future, namely (1) Regarding the counterpart objects of the transfer, the Manchurian side wanted to include the Soviet Russian co-management rights of the Chinese Eastern Railway and the ancillary businesses of the Chinese Eastern Railway, while the Soviet Russian side insisted on the ownership of the Chinese Eastern Railway and proposed to value the ancillary businesses separately. (2) Regarding the basis for valuation, the Manchurian side wanted to base it on the economic value after the independence of "Manchukuo", while the Soviet Russian side wanted to base it on the investment conditions during the imperial era and the purport of the 1924-1925 memorandum, namely that the Soviet Russian side wanted to actively acknowledge the value for future valuation, while the Manchurian side was passive. (3) Although the selling price has not been specifically determined, there is already a huge gap between the claims of both sides. The Soviet Russian side is asking for a very high price. If they do not humbly and calmly deal with the situation and engage in compromises, there will be many twists and turns ahead. (4th Electric Communication Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that the content of the Russian representative's proposal at yesterday's meeting is as follows: (1) The Russian side will sell the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway from Manchuria Station to Harbin, the eastern section from Harbin to Suifenhe, and the southern section from Harbin to Kuanchengzi (the Russian side stated the price, but it cannot be made public now). (2) The ancillary businesses of the Chinese Eastern Railway, such as coal mines, forests, power plants, and other various affiliated businesses, will also be sold together with the railway. (3) The so-called French debt and the protests of the Chinese government regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway are not an issue. (4th Joint Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) In yesterday's negotiations on the Chinese Eastern Railway, there was no specific deliberation on any item because the claims of the two countries were quite far apart, and in terms of the amount of money, the values stated by both sides were also more than one billion apart. Therefore, there were difficulties early on. If the Russian side does not have a compromise attitude in the future and the negotiations break down, the foreign affairs authorities said that the Japanese side is not actively mediating. (4th Electric Communication Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to a publicity by the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Russian side raised the issue of the puppet Manchu severing the Suifenhe transfer point at yesterday's Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations and said that "Manchukuo" should be responsible for compensating its losses. Puppet Manchu is very dissatisfied with this point and plans to cite six reasons to refute the Russian claim at tomorrow's meeting. (4th China United Electric Dispatch)</p>

<p>European Countries Issue a Joint Declaration on Gold</p>
<p>Explaining the Need to Maintain Currency Prices</p>
<p>Almost Officially Declaring a Currency War on the United States</p>
<p>(London) The core leadership committee of the Economic Conference met this morning and decided that the core leadership should convene a plenary meeting on Thursday to announce a recess. It was also decided that the various working committees that can work should proceed as usual until Thursday. The proposal for a recess was put forward by the Dutch Ambassador, Kurrien, and seconded by the British representative, Simon, and the French representative, Bonnet. The US representative, Cox, did not vote in favor. It is heard that the US will oppose the recess. British Prime Minister MacDonald and Commercial Secretary Runciman neither approved nor opposed the proposal, but said that experts still have time to discuss the conference issues on the new basis of the US President's declaration. The core leadership plenary meeting is scheduled to be held at 4:00 PM this afternoon. The postponement proposal now seems certain to be passed. If so, the core leadership will still exist to maintain the conference mechanism. (4th Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The World Economic Conference has run aground on the reefs of gold. The stalemate caused by President Roosevelt's declaration cannot be broken. What remains to be decided is the conditions for the postponement. Today's afternoon meeting has almost three ways: (1) Complete abandonment of the conference; (2) Preservation of the conference's operating mechanism; (3) Postponement of the meeting after granting the chairman the power to reconvene the meeting when stability is obtained in the future. It is said that the third method is the best. Since the recess is directly due to the issue of stabilizing currency prices, it is expected that the official date for reopening the meeting cannot be predetermined. (4th Reuters News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The five European countries that maintain the gold standard, France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, issued a joint declaration, saying:</p>
<p>"The governments signing this declaration are convinced that maintaining their currency prices is a fundamental plan for the world economic recovery and for restoring credit activities, and it is a guarantee of the social progress created by the countries. Therefore, they reaffirm their firm will to maintain a freely operating gold standard within the current monetary law structure at the current gold parity in each country, and request each central bank to maintain close cooperation to give this declaration the greatest effectiveness."</p>
<p>This declaration was signed at a meeting at the Savoy Hotel, where the French representative was staying, in response to the US President's statement on US monetary policy.</p>
<p>The British delegation is expected to issue a separate declaration, but it has not yet been issued. It is heard that at least for the moment, the British territories will not issue an official declaration. (3rd National Electric Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Since the United States opposed the temporary stabilization plan, the French representatives refused to attend the afternoon meeting of the core group committee and consulted with the representatives of the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, Poland, and Italy to draft a declaration reaffirming the maintenance of the gold standard.</p>
<p>It is said that the central banks will be instructed to cooperate to maintain the current parity of their respective currencies with gold. This declaration is tantamount to declaring a currency war on the United States. The meeting is expected to break down as a result, so most representatives now advocate an immediate recess.

Although the American delegation will oppose extending the conference, if an extension is passed, the American delegation will support the second or third options. It is reported that the American representatives are currently divided on these two options. It is understood that several American representatives feel that their current position is extremely complex and that no progress can be made, because the American president's remarks have caused intense anti-American sentiment, making it impossible to achieve anything. (Reuters dispatch, 4th) (London) The American delegation is dissatisfied with the idea that the responsibility for extending the Economic Conference lies with President Roosevelt and is planning to take surprising action at the main steering committee meeting this afternoon. It is expected that the American delegation will present a concrete plan to the conference to show that the United States is willing to cooperate. Some say that the American proposal will be related to raising world prices. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(New York) Today's newspapers report that there is disagreement between the American president and the American representatives regarding the atmosphere of the World Economic Conference. A dispatch from Annapolis to the New York Tribune states that Roosevelt's cabinet held a meeting today on the cruiser Indianapolis, deciding that the Economic Conference should continue, and should not be terminated due to the gold bloc's dissatisfaction with American policy. However, a dispatch from London to the same newspaper states that the American delegation now holds the view that continuing the meeting is essentially useless, and that even if an effort is made to reduce tariffs, no assistance will be obtained. The newspaper also states that the American cabinet is eager to avoid responsibility for disrupting the conference. The New York Times reports that if blame is attributed to the American attitude, President Roosevelt is willing to take responsibility for the conference's failure, but official opinion is that foreign countries cannot gracefully withdraw from the conference.

<p>(Paris) Before departing for England, French Finance Minister Bonnet made a statement to reporters, reiterating that the French government has no intention of abandoning the gold standard, as France's view has not changed. Bonnet stated, "The various facts we see at present not only do not weaken France's view, but can further strengthen it, as it is in accordance with the facts." Regarding domestic issues, Bonnet stated that the treasury's situation is extremely satisfactory and that it is appropriate to issue another batch of public bonds at this time to prepare for the future. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Paris) The attitude of the French delegation to the London Economic Conference has now been clearly expressed without any doubt. French Finance Minister Bonnet had lunch with Prime Minister Daladier on Sunday, and the two had a long conversation. Afterwards, he consulted with Moret, the governor of the Bank of France. On the same afternoon, French President Lebrun delivered an important speech in Besancon, stating, "If currency continues to fluctuate, then any effective treaties or permanent agreements that France might join in the future are merely empty talk." Bonnet returned to London on Sunday evening. According to official statements, the French representatives' attitude from now on is to unconditionally abide by the current strategy of the countries in the continental gold standard bloc in order to seek currency stability. (National Telegraph, 3rd) (Paris) Because the situation at the London Economic Conference is not very smooth, the French government feels that it is possible to raise tariff rates, so this morning it requested extraordinary powers from the parliament. Prime Minister Daladier also explained to the Socialist Party delegation afterwards that the extraordinary powers requested by the government do not tend towards absolute power, and will not diminish the sovereignty of the parliament. (Havas dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government has begun preparations to prevent American goods from entering the French market.

The most promising committees, such as the currency group, the silver group, and the commercial group, have all stalled directly or indirectly due to the American attitude. The wheat group and the production and marketing group among the various committees may be expected to proceed as usual.

The absence of the French representatives has given rise to all sorts of unfounded rumors. Although America's refusal to participate in the currency stabilization plan has forced the work of the Economic Conference to be temporarily suspended, France does not disregard the work of the various committees because of this, and it does not take the future of the Economic Conference lightly. At this time, there are indeed those who advocate extending the Economic Conference, but France has never made such a proposal. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>(London) The World Economic Conference's currency committee, the subcommittee dealing with the silver issue, met this morning, chaired by American representative Pittman. Opinions were exchanged on whether a compromise could be reached between silver-producing and silver-storing countries. It was decided to continue private talks, and to report to the subcommittee once a satisfactory result has been achieved. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(London) The Economic Committee's subcommittee discussing the organization of production and sales issues discussed the timber issue today, deciding to organize a special subcommittee to conduct a review. During the meeting, the Canadian representative launched a fierce attack on the Soviet Union. In his view, the Soviet Union was disrupting the world timber market with unfair competition. The Soviet representative stood up to defend, saying that the Soviet Union's foreign trade monopoly policy could at least guarantee that Russia would abide by the various agreements signed in the future.

<p>(London) Gold bloc countries are considering raising the issue of adjourning the World Economic Conference, but British Prime Minister MacDonald and his cabinet members held meetings with representatives of British dominions repeatedly in the morning and afternoon. The situation is tense, but the British Prime Minister still does not admit defeat. (Reuters dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(London) It is reported that MacDonald is currently striving to maintain the survival of the conference, at least to reach a temporary agreement on economic issues before adjourning. However, European representatives believe that President Roosevelt's rejection is so firm that continuing the meeting is a waste of effort. These people also expressed deep shock at the American declaration. (National Telegraph, 3rd)</p>

<p>(London) The British government today reiterated in the House of Commons that Britain's ultimate goal is to restore the gold standard when stable conditions can be guaranteed. Treasury representative Hall-Billyshaw declared that we must retain complete freedom to choose the timing of equalization. He has given due consideration to the point raised by the questioner that many British merchants believe that attempting to stabilize the exchange market without first ensuring a sufficient amount of trade is inconsistent with proper procedures and is detrimental to British commerce.

<p>(London) The American declaration on monetary policy was changed again by a telegram from the American president before it was released, making it far more firm and vehement than the summary that Hull had previously distributed to the representatives for their review. Even the American delegation was as surprised by it as the European representatives. As a result, the situation at the meetings yesterday and today has been fluctuating, and the attitude of the leaders of the gold standard countries has also changed from soft to hard.

<p>(London) Now that Europe recognizes that stabilizing currency is necessary for economic and financial recovery, it is expected that a currency war will occur in the future.

The American delegation cannot agree on whether to withdraw the Pittman proposal of June 19.

<p>(London) With the stabilization of currency now hopeless, the main steering committee's convocation of the full conference to announce the decision to adjourn did not affect the foreign exchange market. The market situation today remains the same as yesterday. The US dollar is still under attack. The US dollar opened at 4.485 today, and soon fell to 4.53, a new low since Britain abandoned the gold standard. It later rose to 4.475 due to purchases from continental Europe. The market is filled with pessimism, and fluctuations are too drastic, making it very difficult to trade US dollars. (Reuters dispatch, 4th)</p>
<p>(New York) After President Roosevelt's declaration refusing to stabilize currency was released, Wall Street rallied, with a vehemence not seen since 1929. The US dollar exchange rate fell sharply, and the number of shares traded in various securities reached 7 million, mostly up by about one and a quarter points. (Havas dispatch, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) According to news from Japanese financial circles, the meeting has reached a stalemate because the American president refused to address the issue of stabilizing exchange rates proposed by European gold standard countries. Japan is taking the same action as the United States, standing on the side of non-gold standard countries. (China United Press, 4th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Economic Conference has been completely pessimistic due to the United States' declaration opposing exchange agreements, and the world's economic war is increasingly intensifying. It is impossible to predict how far the American expansion panic will cause the US dollar to fall, which is extremely worthy of attention. If the trend continues, the British-American exchange rate will inevitably reach 50 cents per US dollar, and the Japanese-American exchange rate will inevitably reach 28 cents per US dollar. Although the rising prices of American cotton, silk, wheat, etc., do not affect Japan above the exchange rate decline, it is worthy of attention whether it will continue in the future.

<h3 id="e35">China's Technical Cooperation with the League of Nations <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Zi</p>
<p>A Havas dispatch from Geneva on the 3rd stated that Song Ziwen presented a technical cooperation plan to the League of Nations Administrative Council, requesting the appointment of a liaison officer, and stated that the League of Nations Administrative Council was prepared to organize a special committee to take beneficial measures. This event should attract more attention from the Chinese people than the cotton and wheat loan, and the cotton and wheat loan was a sudden piece of news, while China's technical cooperation with the League of Nations has a history of more than three years to trace. Now, let us first describe the history of this matter.</p>
<p>During the spring of the 20th year, the director of the League of Nations Labor Bureau, the Minister of Health, and the water conservancy commissioner came to China to investigate. Song Ziwen, in his capacity as Minister of Finance of the National Government, sent a letter of cooperation request to the League of Nations, and at the same time established the National Economic Committee to establish a foundation for cooperation. Soon after, Song's "Ten-Year Construction Plan" and the League of Nations Labor Bureau and the Administrative Council's "Ten-Year Plan for the Development of China" were published successively. The League of Nations' Ten-Year Plan for the Development of China was based on the Soviet Union's Five-Year Plan, and its main points were: (1) to open up 30,000 acres of Chinese wasteland, (2) to expand China's railways, highways, air routes, and other transportation businesses, (3) to build several seaports along the Chinese coast, (4) to build 8 million tons of merchant ships for sea and inland river commercial transportation, and (5) to build large factories to manufacture objects needed by the Chinese people. After this plan was made public, the Japanese immediately clamored that the League of Nations was preparing to co-manage China. Three months after the September 18th Incident, Japanese commentator Reietsu Ienaga pointed out in his essay that Song's cooperation with the League of Nations had aroused the opposition and conspired with Japan to resist the movement, causing the surprise attack in Shenyang. Although Ienaga's words are not entirely credible, there is a common understanding among informed people that these two events are not without any relationship. After the national crisis, the League of Nations educational experts came to China to investigate before the January 28th Shanghai War. Recently, League of Nations legal experts also came to Nanjing to reorganize our country's administrative laws and regulations. The matter of cooperation between China and the League of Nations did not stop due to the resistance to Japan, which is also obvious.</p>
<p>Now that the Tanggu Truce has been signed for more than a month, and the Dalian Conference is the day for important Sino-Japanese consultations, Song reported to the League of Nations Administrative Council the plan that "China has decided to step up construction work in several provinces and regions to make them model areas," requesting the designation of a technician to act as a closer liaison. We have not been able to read Song's documents on building several model provinces and regions in China, and we have not been able to obtain appropriate materials for discussion on this matter. However, there seems to be no item in the previous "Ten-Year Construction Plan" and "Ten-Year Plan for the Development of China" to establish model provinces and regions. Is this new plan being adjusted to reality due to the change in international forces in China, changing the construction of the entire China to the construction of several provinces with small scopes?</p>
<p>The use of foreign capital and foreign technology is neither purely beneficial nor purely harmful. It depends on the ability of the user. In the past, both the United States and Japan used foreign investment to build their countries, but the Congo and Egypt cannot be mentioned on the same day. The Soviet Union is now using American technicians and American machinery to carry out its five-year construction plan, and the construction results have shocked the world. Can China's technical cooperation with the League of Nations follow the Soviet Union and create amazing construction results? Or will it be controlled, as the Japanese cursed, leading to a co-management situation? This is why we cannot help but be fearful when we hear the sound of cooperation.</p>

<h3 id="e38">The Budgets of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces are Severely Deficient <a href="#e38" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c38" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">38</a></h3>
<p>Gu Zhutong and Lu Diping Have Both Left Beijing</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan has not yet come up with a concrete solution for the budget proposals of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in the 22nd year. Regarding the construction expenditure in Zhejiang province, the actual difference is more than 5 million, of which local construction expenditure accounts for about 2 million. The Zhejiang Provincial Government firmly requests the Central Government to restore the monthly subsidy of 150,000 yuan to complete local construction. More than 3 million are border road construction costs related to national defense that the Central Government has set a deadline for completion, and it is hoped that the Central Government will provide subsidies. The financial situation in Jiangsu is even more complicated, and the Central Government's current strength is really helpless. The authorities of the two provinces now hope that if the salt tax increase can achieve its goal, Zhejiang can increase its annual income by more than 1.4 million, and Jiangsu can also increase its revenue by more than 2.6 million. The Central Government did not immediately approve it. President Wang said that it could be discussed at length. On the 4th, Chairman Gu Zhutong of Jiangsu and Hall Chief Shu Shiyou returned to Zhenjiang, and Chairman Lu Diping of Zhejiang and Hall Chief Zhou Junyan returned to Hangzhou. The financial problems of the two provinces can only be fully resolved after Song Ziwen returns to the country. According to Zhou Junyan, Zhejiang's financial start-up methods are not without hope. For example, clearing the land throughout the province, reorganizing lost grain land, and reorganizing taxes to be paid can increase the field tax by 60% without increasing the burden on the people. However, the cost of clearing the land during the event is almost 20 to 30 million, and Zhejiang province does not have this financial capacity at this time. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Panchen's representatives, Anqin Wang Luojie, etc., telegraphed from Tibet to Beijing, saying that after arriving in Tibet to visit the Dalai Lama, the Dalai Lama's intentions were very good, and he repeatedly expressed his welcome for Panchen to return to Tibet. The time is up to him, but he has not mentioned the arrangements after returning to Tibet. According to those familiar with the situation in Tibet, Panchen intends to restore the management power of Tsang, while the Dalai Lama is still unwilling to give up the power of Tsang. Therefore, it is difficult to determine when Panchen's return to Tibet can be realized. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>A Decision Can Only Be Made After Song Returns to the Country</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister Chen Gongbo of the Ministry of Industry, Mining Division Chief Huang Jintao, and the Ministry of Finance discussed the 20 million coal industry bond case. The Ministry of Industry's opinion is that the issuance of this bond does not conflict with the existing bonds, and all repayment of principal and interest will be borne by the miners themselves, and it will be issued soon. However, the Ministry of Finance's opinion is that although this coal industry bond is borne by the miners themselves for the repayment of principal and interest, it is considered a formal national bond after passing through the Ministry, and the government has a corresponding responsibility. If merchants issue it themselves, it is called a corporate bond, and the government may not intervene. Therefore, the Ministry should carefully consider whether or not to issue coal bonds to avoid future worries. Even if miners guarantee the stability of the principal and interest, a decision will only be made after Minister Song returns to the country. (Special dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>(Changchun) According to the Kanto Army's newspaper, the Japanese military has restricted the total number of puppet army troops to 108,000, with a total expenditure of 46.69 million yuan, an increase of 3.19 million yuan compared with the previous year. It also drafted the expenditure for suppressing the volunteer army in 1934 as follows: (1) 1.385 million yuan for the puppet military and political department's temporary expenditure for suppressing the volunteer army, (2) 4 million yuan for the security maintenance association's expenditure for suppressing the volunteer army, (3) 7 million yuan for the expenditure for suppressing the volunteer army under the pretext of opening up roads. The total expenditure for dealing with the volunteer army other than military expenditure is 12.385 million yuan. The financial resources are based on the basic policy of raising tariffs and levying import taxes on goods imported from our mainland. By means of this policy, Japan can not only obtain funds to massacre the Chinese people, but also hinder our country's trade with the four eastern provinces. (China United Press dispatch, 4th)</p>

<p>Soviet Russia Apologizes to Japan and Promises to Punish Those Responsible for the Death of Japanese Fishermen</p>
<p>Reuters, Moscow, 3rd – The Soviet Deputy Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Sokolnikov, told Japanese Ambassador Ota today that the incident of three Japanese fishermen being shot dead in Kamchatka has been investigated and confirmed to be true. He expressed apologies on behalf of the Soviet government and guaranteed that the Soviet government would punish the Soviet personnel involved in the incident.</p>
<p>TASS, Moscow, 3rd – The Acting Soviet Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Sakolnikov, reported to Japanese Ambassador Ota yesterday on the results of the investigation into the incident of Soviet guards shooting three Japanese fishermen on the coast of Kamchatka. The investigation was conducted by Soviet officials in Kamchatka under the supervision of representatives of the Foreign Affairs Committee. He informed Ota that although the investigation was not yet complete, certain facts had been fully confirmed. It was reported that a conflict occurred between Soviet coast guards and three Japanese fishermen on June 15 in the Olka Cape area on the east coast of Kamchatka (it was previously reported that the incident occurred at Kronotsky Cape, where there were no Soviet coast guards, which was incorrect). After the conflict, the coast guards at Olka Cape disappeared, and their whereabouts are still unknown but are being searched for. Documents found in the office of the coast guard station confirm that the incident of the three Japanese fishermen being shot dead was indeed true and that the fishermen were shot for not allowing the coast guards to use weapons. Sakolnikov also informed Ota that the Soviet government would severely punish those directly or indirectly responsible for the case and would also compensate the families of the murdered fishermen for the losses they suffered due to the improper actions of the coast guards.</p>
<p>Dentsu, Tokyo, 4th – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram stating that the Soviet government's apology regarding the Tomi Maru incident had been delivered to Ambassador Ota by Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Sokolnikov.

Justice Minister Oyama reported on the incident of Japanese people committing violence against Soviet trade representatives, stating that the perpetrators had no ideological background and that the violence was caused by resentment over the murder of the Japanese fishermen. Education Minister Hatoyama reported on the Kyoto University issue, and the meeting adjourned at noon.</p>

<p>The Success of Soviet Diplomacy: Security Pacts Signed with Various Countries in Eastern Europe and the Near East; Similar Treaties to be Concluded with the Little Entente; "Aggressor" Defined in Treaties</p>
<p>Le Matin, London, 3rd – Today, Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov and representatives of Persia, Afghanistan, Turkey, Poland, Romania, Latvia, and Estonia signed an unprecedented security pact containing a definition of "aggressor." He then made a brief speech, stating that all countries would be invited to join the pact. Finland is about to join, and China is expected to join in the future. Today, Lithuania did not join the pact due to Poland's opposition to Lithuania signing because of the dispute over the Vilnius region. However, Litvinov has stated that the Soviet Union will conclude a treaty of the same nature with Lithuania separately.</p>
<p>Le Matin, Berlin, 4th – News from various parts of Europe indicates that the governments and newspapers of the countries that signed the multilateral non-aggression pact in London are extremely excited about the new treaty. Litvinov declared in London that the signatory countries have a total population of 265 million people and that peace is guaranteed by this new treaty. News from the Romanian capital states that Romania views this new treaty as a new guarantee of non-aggression against Bessarabia. Semi-official news from Prague states that Czechoslovakia and Yugoslavia will soon join the new treaty. News from the Polish capital states that the Polish Foreign Minister declared that the new treaty is of utmost importance and that Poland is particularly satisfied. Furthermore, according to a detailed analysis by the Polish Telegraph Agency, Poland is even more pleased that Turkey has signed the new treaty because it allows Poland to maintain its traditional friendship with Turkey.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd – Today, the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, Lithuania, Estonia, Persia, Poland, Romania, and Turkey signed an important non-aggression treaty here. The treaty is divided into five sections and one appendix, which defines an aggressor as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The first to declare war;</p>
<p>(2) Occupying the territory of another country without declaring war;</p>
<p>(3) Attacking the land, sea, or air forces of the other party with land, sea, or air forces;</p>
<p>(4) Blockading the coast and seaports of another country;</p>
<p>(5) Supporting, within its own territory, gangs that invade the territory of another country and refusing the request of the invaded country to take appropriate steps to stop such gangs within its territory.</p>
<p>The appendix declares that the signatory countries shall not use any event as a pretext for aggression.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 3rd – At the signing of the non-aggression treaty today, Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov issued a statement saying that the definition of aggressor had been proposed in Geneva, but it was considered inconvenient for certain countries. Therefore, he now wishes to include this definition in a treaty only between a limited number of countries. This treaty is a new link in strengthening peaceful relations between the Soviet Union and its neighboring countries. The Soviet government is now prepared to sign similar treaties with countries around the world.</p>
<p>Havas, London, 3rd – It is reported that the Soviet Union will soon sign a treaty with the countries of the Little Entente (Romania has already signed this treaty with the Soviet Union) that defines an aggressor. It is also reported that similar negotiations will be conducted between the Soviet Union and Italy.</p>
<p>Reuters, London, 4th – The conclusion of the non-aggression pact between the Soviet Union and Afghanistan, Estonia, Latvia, Persia, Poland, Romania, and Turkey has been widely discussed in the lounges of the People's Economic Conference today, and has been described as Litvinov's strategy. Someone asked a Soviet official, "Why are China, Japan, and Manchukuo not included?" The official replied, "Oh, our work is not yet finished."</p>
<p>Danzig Suddenly Pro-Polish</p>
<p>Havas, Warsaw, 3rd – The Mayor of Danzig, Lu Zhenning, and the Deputy Mayor, Glasser, arrived here together this morning. President Moscicki and Foreign Minister Beck personally welcomed them. Lu declared that the Polish authorities had treated them very well, for which he was extremely grateful. He also stated emphatically that the new government of Danzig wishes to cooperate with Poland. He hopes that representatives of the Polish government will also visit Danzig soon.</p>
<p>Germany and the Holy See Reach an Agreement</p>
<p>Havas, Vatican City, Rome, 3rd – According to well-informed sources, the religious treaty negotiated between the Holy See and Germany may be initialed tomorrow. However, German sources only say that the conclusion of the treaty will not be delayed.</p>
<p>Havas, Vatican City, Rome, 4th – Negotiations for a religious treaty between Germany and the Holy See have ended. German Deputy Chancellor von Papen has telegraphed the results of the negotiations to Berlin. A reply is expected this afternoon. Vatican sources say that the Pope wants to obtain full guarantees for the activities of the Catholic Church in Germany.</p>
<p>Higher Court's Response to the Chen Peng Appeal (Prosecutor Asks to Uphold the Original Sentence)</p>
<p>The case of Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, and other leaders of the Trotskyist faction of the Communist Party has been separately sentenced by the Suzhou Higher Court. Chen Duxiu, Peng Shuzhi, Pu Yifan, Guo Jinghao, Wang Wu, Wang Zhaoqun, Wang Ziping, and He Afang have been sentenced to imprisonment. Wang Jiantang and Liang Youguang were found innocent. They are being held at the Jiangning District Court Detention Center. Wang Jiantang and Liang Youguang have already been released. Wang Ziping and He Afang have waived their right to appeal. The Central Committee of the Kuomintang believed that Wang Ziping should be dealt with according to party discipline, and has transferred the matter to the Suzhou Higher Court. The Central Committee has prepared a document to the detention center to take him away. The remaining seven people are still in custody. Chen Duxiu and the other six people have appealed to the Supreme Court in accordance with the law. On the 2nd, the prosecutor of the Suzhou Higher Court (acting as the plaintiff) also filed a response to the Supreme Court to appeal against Chen and others, asking the court to reject the defendants' appeals. The full response of the prosecutor of the Higher Court is recorded below.</p>
<p>(Response to Chen Peng's Appeal)</p>
<p>The defendants in this case, Chen Duxiu and Peng Shuzhi, organized the Left Opposition faction of the Chinese Communist Party and used words to promote class struggle by inciting workers and poor peasants to revolt, to organize the Soviet Union, to overthrow the National Government of the Kuomintang, and to establish a dictatorship of the proletariat, engaging in treasonous propaganda. The defendants themselves have admitted this without denial, and there is also documentary evidence. The facts of their endangering the Republic of China are extremely clear. The original judgment, based on Article 2, Section 2 and Articles 6 and 74 of the Emergency Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic of China, imposes a just sentence and is entirely appropriate.</p>
<p>Reviewing the appeal, it states that countries such as the United Kingdom and the United States do not consider the actions of the Communist Party to be harmful to the state, so why is China different? It should be known that each country has its own political system, and no strong comparisons can be made. The Republic of China has already formulated the Law for the Punishment of Acts Endangering the Republic of China. Since the defendants have violated this law, they should be punished in accordance with the law. The intent of the appeal, which refers to the political systems of other countries, is an attempt to evade responsibility, and its reasoning is therefore not valid.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the appeal states that the National Government is not the state and that overthrowing the government cannot be considered harmful to the Republic of China. The Three Principles of the People are the foundation for the construction of the Republic of China, and the Kuomintang and the National Government are both leading organizations engaged in the construction of the Republic of China. The original judgment has already explained this point in great detail. The Central Opposition faction organized by the defendants aims to overthrow the Three Principles of the People and the National Government of the Kuomintang, which is clearly an act of endangering the Republic of China. The defendants' treasonous propaganda is even more explicit. The intent of the appeal is to deliberately distort the facts, which is difficult to consider reasonable. It is hoped that the original judgment will be upheld and the appeal rejected.</p>
<p>Zhu, Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Higher Court.</p>
<p>(Response to Pu Yifan and Others' Appeal)</p>
<p>Reviewing the appellants' arguments, it is stated that the basis of the judgment is entirely based on speculation and that there is no specific evidence or favorable evidence, and that no investigation has been conducted. On October 15, 1932, Wang Wu (Song Fengchun), Pu Yifan, and Wang Zhaoqun attended a regular weekly meeting of the Communist Party at Xie Shaoshan's home. Xie Shaoshan stated in the Shanghai Public Concession Police Station and the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court that "they were holding their regular weekly meeting when we were arrested." Therefore, the original judgment's recognition of organizing gatherings is not without basis. Wang Wu and Pu Yifan are also candidates for the Central Standing Committee of the Left Opposition faction of the Chinese Communist Party, which has also been clearly stated in separate statements by Xie Shaoshan, Chen Duxiu, and Peng Shuzhi. These statements are all on file and can be reviewed. Guo Jinghao (Peng Daozhi) joined the Communist Party's Opposition faction and engaged in student movements and organizational work. The school registration form (i.e., the Communist Party registration form) seized by the Public Security Bureau contains very detailed records, which are also supported by evidence. The original judgment's basis for conviction is indeed appropriate. The intent of the appeal, which is full of evasive statements, is not reasonable. It is requested that the original judgment be upheld and the appeal rejected.</p>
<p>Zhu, Prosecutor of the Jiangsu Higher Court.</p>
<p>Newspaper Reports on the So-Called Secret Agreement Between the Late Qing Dynasty and Imperial Russia Regarding the Construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>Since the dispute between the Manchu puppet state and Soviet Russia over the seizure of trains in northern Manchuria in March, Soviet Russia, under pressure from Japan and in order to thoroughly complete the second five-year plan and avoid foreign wars, has disregarded China's sovereignty over the Chinese Eastern Railway and proposed to Japan to sell the railway. Envoys have traveled back and forth for several months, and formal negotiations for the sale finally began in Tokyo on the 27th of last month. Unexpectedly, at this time, the Dongbao newspaper suddenly spread rumors that foreign reporters had discovered a secret agreement between China and Russia when the railway was built. On the same day that the Russo-Japanese-Manchu meeting was held in Tokyo, the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun published a lengthy article by Janice Ward, a Tokyo correspondent for the Chicago Daily News, stating that Russia signed a secret treaty with the Qing government when it built the railway. The purpose was to prevent Japanese attacks and involved France. The original text of Ward's article and the so-called text of the Russo-Chinese secret agreement are translated and await verification by historians. If they are purely fictional, they are enough to expose one aspect of international conspiratorial diplomacy. Based on this, we can further understand the national position of Soviet Russia in selling the railway this time, and the intention of Chicago Daily News reporter Ward in writing the article.</p>
<p>The following is the original text written by Ward.</p>
<p>Historical Recollections: Just Like the Ghost of Long Gone Politicians from Past History, a Secret Sino-Russian Treaty from 1896 Has Been Discovered Today, Causing Trouble for the Current Issue of Selling the North Manchurian Railway.</p>
<p>The outstanding Li Hongzhang and Count Witte have both become people of the underworld. In today's world where Tsarist Russia and the Imperial Qing Dynasty have both disappeared, these recollections of past treaties awaken a kind of evil taint and have become a mockery of current facts. All of this is especially distressing for China and France.</p>
<p>The Sino-Russian-French Alliance</p>
<p>The obvious intention behind this secret treaty is that the railway was built with the purpose of challenging Japan. Therefore, Japan or "Manchukuo," which is a country aided by Japan, would have difficulty demanding the rights and claims of transfer from either France or China. France invested in the railway and was therefore able to obtain a claim to the railway. Similarly, China or "Manchukuo" also has a claim to half of the rights. However, "the loser loses everything" is the natural result of war. Russia was defeated in the Russo-Japanese War, so in terms of the constraints of the treaty, China and France, which formed a secret alliance with Russia, should also be considered to have suffered losses.</p>
<p>The secret treaty was discovered in Moscow. There are legal technical differences. The Russo-Japanese War was resolved by the Treaty of Portsmouth in 1905. If the existence of this secret treaty had been known at that time, the result would likely have been different. Japan could have seized Manchuria as early as 1905, without waiting for September 18, 1931. It would also have acquired the railway earlier than today, as early as 1905.</p>
<p>The Treaty of Portsmouth completed the settlement between Japan and Russia, postponing the determination of the decision between Japan and China and France to a later date. Now, this treaty has been brought out of the ancient chamber, and what is most strange is that the only written copy of the recognized treaty formula is kept in the U.S. State Department in Washington. The original of the Washington Conference Treaty should have been a treasure in the archives of the Soviet and Republic of China governments, but the successive governments in both countries have never published it. The official written copy in the U.S. State Department was acquired after the Washington Conference. At that conference on February 22, 1922, U.S. Secretary of State Hughes recited an abstract of the treaty received from the Chinese representatives, and stated that a full text would be obtained at a later date. The so-called later date means several years after the occasion. It was certainly not included in the report of the conference. The abstract and the full text were finally shelved, so the secret treaty still exists in the archives of the U.S. State Department. The full text is only 400 words, so the Chinese representatives in Washington at the time were able to use the abstract to prevent the Japanese representatives from understanding the true content of the treaty. This is the current speculative observation. The abstract in the telegram at the time and the text of the treaty are identical except for the title, "Sino-Russian Alliance Treaty of 1896." The content is completely different. The abstract in the telegram completely conceals the core of the treaty. For example, the abstract of its first article states, "If Japan attempts any aggression in East Asia against the territories of Russia and China, the two contracting parties will provide appropriate support with all their naval and land forces." However, the first article of the text states, "In East Asia, any aggression by Japan against the territories of Russia, China, or Korea shall be deemed inevitable and shall immediately invoke the application of this treaty. In such circumstances, the two contracting parties shall mutually support each other with all naval and land forces available at the time, and shall agree to provide the greatest possible assistance in supplying food to the forces of each contracting party." The military intention is clear.</p>
<p>As for Article 4, which refers to the Chinese Eastern Railway, the abstract of this article states, "The Chinese government agrees to build a railway line across Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province in the direction of Unachosk. The Qing Russia Bank (i.e., the Sino-Russian Dao Sheng Bank) is allowed to build and operate the railway line. The contract will be concluded between the Chinese Minister in St. Petersburg and the Qing Russia Bank." This article does not express the military purpose of the railway. However, Article 4 of the text states, "The Chinese government, in order to ensure the means for its troops to easily receive a certain location when the Russian army is invaded, agrees to build a railway line across Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province in the direction of Unachosk."</p>
<p>Li Hongzhang's Son</p>
<p>The then-Chinese Minister in London was Li Hongzhang's son, who criticized his father's diplomacy. He published his own opinion in the London Daily Review, detailing the beginning and end of the negotiations in 1896 when his father attended the coronation of the Russian Tsar Nicholas. At the time, this article did not attract much attention. It was generally speculated that Russia must have bribed important Chinese officials with large sums of money for the signing of the treaty. The article did not mention this. Only four years later, the former French ambassador to Russia, M. Sernard, published a memoir, which made the treaty document even clearer. Later, at the Versailles Peace Conference in 1919, Chiron also mentioned the treaty in his book on Russia. The official recognition of the treaty was 26 years after the treaty was signed. It expired 11 years later. The publication of the abstract of the telegram at the Washington Conference was later followed by the full text. China also formally recognized it recently. George P. Leesh asked the U.S. State Department to read the written copy of the treaty for Far Eastern affairs. However, the State Department replied that the full text in the MacMurray Treaties was no different from the "unofficial written copy of the French text." Only the U.S. State Department, which holds the French text, knows the truth.</p>
<p>The Full Text of the So-Called Secret Qing-Russian Treaty at the Time of the Construction of the Chinese Eastern Railway</p>
<p>The next day after the above article was published (June 28), the Asahi Shimbun published the full text of the secret treaty, stating that the construction cost of the Chinese Eastern Railway was actually paid by France. At the time, China and Russia concluded a secret treaty, which was unknown to outsiders for 23 years. The text of the secret treaty is now revealed as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1: In East Asia, any aggression by Japan against the territories of Russia, China, or Korea shall be deemed inevitable and shall immediately invoke the application of this treaty. In such circumstances, the two contracting parties shall mutually support each other with all naval and land forces available at the time, and shall agree to provide the greatest possible assistance in supplying food to the forces of each contracting party.</p>
<p>Article 2: After the two contracting parties begin joint activities, neither contracting party may conclude a peace treaty with the enemy without the consent of the other party.</p>
<p>Article 3: In the event of war, all ports of Qing China shall, if necessary, be used by Russian warships, and the Qing government authorities shall provide all necessary assistance.</p>
<p>Article 4: The Chinese government, fearing that Russian troops would be vulnerable to invasion and in order to ensure the means for its troops to easily reach a certain location, agrees to build a railway line across Heilongjiang Province and Jilin Province in the direction of Unachosk. The connection of the railway with the Russian railway shall not be used as a pretext to infringe upon the territory of Qing China and the sovereignty of the Qing Emperor. The terms for concluding a contract for the construction and operation of the railway by the Qing Russia Bank shall be formally discussed between the Qing Minister in St. Petersburg and the Qing Russia Bank.</p>
<p>Article 5: In the event of war, Russia may freely use the railway described in Article 4 for the transportation of troops and the supply of food, as described in Article 1. In peacetime, Russia shall retain the same rights for the transportation of troops and goods, but shall not be allowed to stop except when necessary for transportation.</p>
<p>Article 6: The terms of Article 4 of this treaty shall come into effect when the Qing Emperor approves it. This treaty shall be valid for fifteen years from that time. Six months before the expiration of the term, the two contracting parties may consider extending its duration.</p>
<p>Songjiang Asks the Ministry of Finance to Stop the New Liquor Tax</p>
<p>The Sijing Township Chamber of Commerce believes that the newly established liquor tax is harassing merchants and petitions the Ministry of Finance to stop it. The text of the petition is recorded below.</p>
<p>Petition: Regarding the New Liquor Tax Regulations Harassing Merchants, We Urgently Request a Stop.</p>
<p>According to a letter from the Jiangzao Industry Association of our township, domestic liquors have been subject to the public sales tax. Recently, the Tax Administration has drastically changed the original public sales tax, implementing a fixed-amount tax on domestic liquors, which will be implemented on July 1. The tax rate regulations are complex and severe, and the penalties are heavy. Once implemented, not only will merchants be unable to bear the burden, but even minor oversights in the procedures will lead to legal trouble. This is tantamount to destroying domestic liquors, while imported foreign liquors can be sold unhindered. The future of the industry is unimaginable. We urge your association to forward this petition to stop this tax in order to leave a ray of hope for domestic goods and to prevent endless suffering for the industry.</p>
<p>We have investigated and found that commerce is failing at an alarming rate. Now, the liquor merchants are burdened with a harassing fixed-amount tax, which is unbearable. Therefore, we have prepared this petition and sincerely request the Minister to quickly stop this tax.</p>

<p>A small monk named Abao was irrigating birds at the Third Spring under the Iron Flower Rock of the Stone Guanyin Hall on Tiger Hill yesterday (early morning of the 4th). Suddenly, he discovered a white silk shirt next to the Third Spring Pavilion. He looked into the Third Spring and was shocked to see the body of a young man. He went down the hill to report to the responsible Public Security Branch, which sent the officer in charge with personnel to retrieve the body of the young man. The corpse was about 20 years old, with delicate features and glasses on his nose. He was wearing a undershirt and black silk pants, resembling a student.

<h3 id="e56">Suspect Arrested in Major Robbery on Nanjing Road <a href="#e56" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c56" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">56</a></h3>
<p>The Siberia Jewelry Company at No. 82 Nanjing Road was robbed between midnight on the 2nd of this month and the following morning. The thieves dug through the wall from the adjacent building, used electricity to open the safe containing valuable jewelry, and stole diamond jewelry and other items worth more than 100,000 taels of gold. After the company discovered the theft, it immediately reported it to the police, who dispatched detectives to investigate. The police believed that the thieves were likely not Chinese but possibly Russians. A large number of Russian and Western detectives were dispatched to investigate. The day before yesterday afternoon, Russian Detective Aoxueni Kefulov of the General Police Station discovered a Polish man named Sidan Nie Sila Tingqifu on Foch Road who appeared suspicious. He was searched and found to be carrying two keys, which were highly versatile and could open any lock. The Russian detective believed that he was a major suspect in the robbery and immediately arrested him. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, where Judge Qian Hongye interrogated him. Police Lawyer Ru Baozhen stated that the case was currently under investigation and requested a postponement for further interrogation. However, he pointed out that the defendant had been arrested by the Hongkou Police in 1918 for a theft case and sentenced to five years in prison by the court. The severity of the case, which resulted in a five-year sentence, was evident. The fact that he was found with these strange keys made him a major suspect. The defendant completely denied the charges. Judge Qian ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the interrogation after further investigation.</p>
<p>Sun Jun Guanghua Passes Away</p>
<p>Sun Jun Guanghua, who previously studied in the United States, worked as an attaché at the Chinese Embassy in the United Kingdom after graduating. He returned to China last year and worked for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government. On the 21st of last month, he suddenly contracted typhoid fever and was admitted to Baolong Hospital in Shanghai for treatment. Unfortunately, his condition worsened, and both Chinese and Western doctors were unable to cure him. He passed away on the afternoon of July 3rd. The hospital has scheduled the funeral for 1:30 PM on the 5th at the International Funeral Home on Jiaozhou Road. Those who had a close friendship with Sun Jun will undoubtedly be deeply saddened to hear of his passing.</p>
<p>Authorities Discuss Revising Train Schedules</p>
<p>For the convenience of passengers, the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways have revised their train schedules, reducing the travel time of the Beijing-Shanghai express train to within seven hours. The travel time of other passenger trains has also been reduced accordingly. In addition, the operating intervals of local trains have been extended, and more stations have been added. Since the implementation on June 1st, passengers have found it convenient. Recently, due to environmental needs, further revisions have been made. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited Mr. Si, the person in charge, yesterday to inquire about the reasons for these revisions. Mr. Si provided a detailed explanation, which is summarized below.</p>
<p>Early Departure of Upbound Connecting Train</p>
<p>The upbound Domestic Joint Transportation Special Train No. 302, which was previously scheduled to depart from the North Station at 1 AM, has been rescheduled to depart at 9:50 PM. Since the preparation for the Capital Ferry began, the Railway Department ordered the planning of a direct train between Ping and Shanghai. Representatives from the Beijing-Ning, Tianjin-Pukou, and Beijing-Shanghai Railways held a meeting in Beijing, where the three railways agreed that the upbound train would depart from Pukou every morning. The Tianjin-Pukou Railway planned to implement the newly revised schedule for the connecting train starting on July 1st. At that time, this railway scheduled the train to depart from Shanghai at 1 AM every day in order to ensure that passengers would not have to wait too long after arriving at Beijing Station. Therefore, passengers traveling between Ping and Shanghai on the connecting train would continue to be transported by the existing Train No. 301 (the original Train No. 4) for the downbound journey, while the upbound journey would be temporarily transported by the existing Train No. 4 express train. However, it was recently learned that the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's newly revised schedule could not be implemented as scheduled due to various reasons. In order to facilitate passengers and avoid overcrowding on the original night express train, this railway decided to advance the departure time of the connecting train to 9:50 PM from the North Station, arriving in Nanjing at 6:10 AM the next morning, before the connecting train truly reaches the Tianjin-Pukou Railway. This new schedule has been implemented since June 22nd.</p>
<p>Later Arrival of Wuxi-Shanghai Local Train</p>
<p>The first Wuxi-Shanghai local train still departs from Wuxi Station at 6 AM and has not been changed. However, after the train arrives at Suzhou Station, it must wait 13 minutes to meet Train No. 14, wait 8 minutes at Weiting Station to meet Train No. 12, wait 22 minutes at Zhengyi Station to meet Train No. 8, wait 28 minutes at Kunshan Station to meet Train No. 16, and wait 9 minutes at Huangdu Station to meet Train No. 4. In total, the waiting time at the stations, in addition to the scheduled stops, takes nearly an hour. Since Trains No. 4, 8, and 12 are all direct trains to Shanghai and Beijing, they should be given priority. Even Trains No. 14 and 16, which are also local trains, are affected by the issue of meeting other trains, making it inevitable to delay the early Wuxi-Shanghai local train. As a result, the arrival time of the local train in Shanghai is 35 minutes later than before. This is due to the difficulties of meeting trains along the single-track line, making it practically unavoidable. This delay can be reduced after the implementation of future route improvement plans.</p>
<p>Reasons for Delayed Departure of Downbound Connecting Train</p>
<p>The newly added Train No. 301, a downbound domestic connecting express train, is the original Beijing-Shanghai downbound Train No. 4 special express train. After the ferry between Beijing and Pukou begins, the departure time from Beijing must be delayed in order to connect with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway's train schedule. In addition, Train No. 9, a medium-speed train between Beijing and Shanghai, is designed to facilitate passengers traveling from Nanjing to Shanghai at noon, and its departure time cannot be too early. Therefore, the arrival time in Shanghai cannot be advanced.</p>
<p>Cancellation of Noon Express After Adding Connecting Train</p>
<p>After adding upbound and downbound domestic connecting express trains on the Beijing-Shanghai Line, the downbound train is operated by the original Beijing-Shanghai Train No. 4 express train. The upbound train, because it must arrive at Beijing Station every morning to connect with the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, an additional upbound train (No. 302) must be added every night. However, due to a shortage of locomotives, the original Shanghai-Beijing noon express train was canceled, and the saved locomotive power was used for the connecting train. After the cancellation of the Shanghai-Beijing noon express train, passengers traveling from Shanghai to stations within the Zhenjiang section can take the newly revised Shanghai-Zhenjiang local train (formerly the Shanghai-Changzhou local train, now extended to Zhenjiang). Passengers traveling from Shanghai to Beijing can take the upbound Train No. 2 Zha Jing express train, which departs from the North Station at 3:10 PM. The travel time has been shortened, and the arrival time in Beijing is similar to the original noon express train, which is still convenient for passengers.</p>
<p>Earlier Departure of Beijing-Xuzhou Local Train</p>
<p>The Beijing-Xuzhou local train was originally scheduled to depart at 5 PM, but it has been advanced to 2 PM. There are three reasons for the earlier departure: 1. After the original Train No. 4 special express train was changed to Train No. 301 domestic connecting train, the departure time was delayed to 5:25 PM. If the local train still departs from Beijing around 5 PM, the two trains would be too close together, and the local train would likely be overtaken by Train No. 301 along the way. 2. After the noon express train departs from Beijing Station at 12:40 PM, downbound passengers must wait until 5:25 PM for the next train, which is too long and inconvenient. Therefore, the local train was advanced to the scheduled time to facilitate passengers. 3. The arrival time of the local train in Xuzhou was too late, which was also inconvenient for passengers. Therefore, the departure time from Beijing was advanced to allow passengers traveling to Xuzhou to arrive earlier.</p>
<p>Beijing-Zhenjiang Local Train to Be Launched Soon</p>
<p>The Railway Bureau revised the schedule to facilitate passengers traveling between Nanjing, the capital, and Zhenjiang, the provincial capital, by adding a local train between Beijing and Zhenjiang in both directions. However, the Zhenjiang Station's facilities, such as the locomotive turntable and passenger car depot, have not yet been completed, so it has not been possible to start operations. The Railway Bureau is making every effort to expedite its completion to facilitate passengers.</p>
<p>Shanghai-Changzhou Local Train Extended to Zhenjiang</p>
<p>To facilitate passengers traveling between Shanghai and Zhenjiang, the Railway Bureau extended the original Shanghai-Changzhou local train to Zhenjiang, renaming it the Shanghai-Zhenjiang Train No. 22. At the same time, the original Changzhou-Shanghai local train was renamed the Zhenjiang-Shanghai Train No. 21 and started operating from Zhenjiang. Starting on June 22nd, the upbound Train No. 22 will make additional stops at Xinzha Zhen, Lucheng, Lingkou, and the South Gate of Zhenjiang. The downbound Train No. 21 will make an additional stop at Luoshe Station. Tickets will be sold to and from these stations to facilitate passengers.</p>
<p>Criminal Wu Bangyin Dies of Injuries Sustained While Resisting Arrest</p>
<p>On the afternoon of December 19th of last year, at 7 PM, Chinese Constables No. 3120 and 3137 of the Gordon Road Police Station encountered four pedestrians on Singapore Road who were acting suspiciously. The constables immediately ordered them to stop for questioning. Unexpectedly, one of them drew a pistol, intending to open fire on the constables. However, the gun was damaged, so although the trigger was pulled, no bullets were fired. The constables, seeing the situation as extremely dangerous, also drew their pistols and fired several shots at him, hitting him in the legs and other areas. After being wounded, the man fell to the ground and was arrested. The other three took the opportunity to escape. The constables transported the injured man to the Gongbu Hospital for treatment and reported the incident to the police station. After further investigation, it was learned that the man was named Wu Bangyin, 30 years old. It was suspected that he and the other fugitives intended to rob a cigarette paper store on Connaught Road that day, but they were caught on the way. Wu died of his injuries the day before yesterday. His body was taken to the Xielun Road morgue. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court dispatched Prosecutor Guo Wei to the morgue to examine the body. After questioning Constables No. 3120 and 3137, and presenting the pistol for inspection, Mr. Guo ruled that the deceased, Wu Bangyin, died from gunshot wounds sustained while resisting arrest. The body was handed over to the Pushan Cemetery for burial. The deceased was found to be carrying a pistol, seven bullets, and one spent shell, which were temporarily handed over to the police station's gun room for safekeeping.</p>
<p>Two Corpses (Headless Girl)</p>
<p>The South Wharf Rescue Bureau's patrol boat recovered a child's body in the Huangpu River the day before yesterday. The child was about six or seven years old and was wearing a calico dress. The child was female, but her head was missing, apparently having been cut off. It is unknown whose child has suffered this tragic fate. The incident was immediately reported to the court, which dispatched a prosecutor to examine the body. The body was ordered to be taken to the morgue to await identification by family members. After questioning, further investigation will be conducted.</p>
<p>(Nie A'mei Dies)</p>
<p>Nie A'mei, a 40-year-old boat dweller from Ningbo, was working on barge No. 222. The day before yesterday, while traveling to the Taikoo Wharf, Nie lost his footing while punting the boat and fell into the river, drowning instantly. The boat owner reported the incident to the water police station, which contacted the Rescue Bureau. Yesterday, the body was recovered and taken to the South Wharf riverside. The incident was reported to the local court, and the prosecutor arrived to examine the body, confirming that the cause of death was drowning. The body was ordered to be taken to the morgue to await instructions.</p>

<p>Wang Zhiqing, the owner of the Banyongtai Bamboo Ware Store at No. 30 Meizhou Road, Yangshupu, had a wife who suffered from true cholera two years ago.

He immediately took her to the Hongkou Infectious Disease Hospital, run by Zhu Jing'an and others on Yucai Road, north of the Hujia Muqiao Bridge. Doctors Lin Chunshan and Li Xiaofang and others carefully examined her and injected saline solution, and she was fortunately brought back from the brink of death. Wang Zhiji was overjoyed and eager to repay the hospital. He invented a specially made plaque with the four characters "Creating Blessings for Society," which was exquisitely crafted and inlaid with bamboo patterns. It was intended to express his gratitude. Yesterday was the day to respectfully deliver the plaque. A military band and a colorful pavilion personally escorted it to the hospital for hanging. Nearby residents came to watch and praised it.

<p>Publishing Industry Author Bookstore Latest News</p>
<p>In recent years, the number of Chinese-language works by Chinese authors has been increasing. However, due to a lack of promotion methods, sales have been sluggish. As a result, authors must still rely on bookstores for consignment sales. However, each bookstore has its own books to publish and distribute, so they cannot focus on promoting other authors' works. Last autumn, a new force emerged: the Author Bookstore, which specializes in consignment sales of works by individuals and academic organizations. This type of independent consignment business has thin profits, which has long been recognized by both the writing and reading communities. Given the high cost of rent and other expenses in Shanghai, it is admirable that the bookstore's manager, Mr. Huang Buxiang, pays authors promptly for their actual sales and never defaults. The bookstore also adheres to the principle of small profits and quick turnover for readers and does not charge high prices. With such determination and spirit, authors across the country are happy to cooperate and entrust the bookstore to distribute their works. The bookstore has recently become the center for the distribution of individual works. It is also offering discount coupons for purchasing books, which can be obtained by mail or in person.</p>

<p>Free Talk The Formation of Experts - Lin Weiyin</p>
<p>If you have perseverance, that is, if you are willing to say the same thing over and over again, it is not difficult for you to become an expert. For example, if you want to become a wine-tasting expert, then you can write an article today saying what are the uses of drinking wine, and write an article tomorrow saying how people who do not drink wine are not poetic or heroic, or say anything, as long as you say it. You can also find examples from Chinese and foreign history, no, just from literary history (this can also incidentally prove that you are a literary figure, because you are so familiar with anecdotes in literary history, it is impossible for people not to believe that you are a literary figure) to say that poet so-and-so could drink three dou in one breath, and novelist so-and-so could drink continuously for seven days without stopping. Or you can far-fetchedly say that whoever drinks more wine has a son who is a genius; or whoever cannot write good articles is because they do not drink wine. Or you can even make up a story saying how those who cannot get wine to drink substitute it with tea with some salt, which can further prove that wine is always indispensable in any environment. And you have to say it as if it were true, as if people don't drink wine or don't know how to drink wine. If they do, it is because of your articles. Then your wine-tasting expert is undoubtedly formed, and later when someone mentions wine, they must mention you and your articles about wine. At the same time, there is another benefit; if your wife does not allow you to drink, you can speak with confidence; or if you yourself think that drinking wine is harmful to your health, but you are unwilling not to drink it, you can also slightly justify yourself with this. Also, you should not think that because you are not good at drinking, you cannot proclaim all of the above; on the contrary, those who are not good at it will proclaim it with great relish. For example, if you say how good a certain dish is, perhaps it is precisely because you do not often eat that dish. Someone who praises opium is someone who is not addicted, at most it only proves that he has smoked opium, and someone who is addicted will not praise it everywhere. So don't worry, the wine-tasting expert is yours.</p>
<p>On "Scholars Without Morals" - Gu Chunfan</p>
<p>Although I myself am also a member of the so-called "scholarly" "forest," I have recently expressed some agreement with the saying "scholars without morals," and I do not completely regard the lamentations of "people's hearts are not as good as they used to be" and "the world is going downhill" as the extreme words of "moralistic gentlemen." Indeed, today's "human hearts" are too terribly treacherous, especially the so-called "scholars," who can come up with and do all kinds of despicable behaviors such as scheming and slandering, spreading rumors and defaming, publicly informing, and selling friends for glory or selling themselves for refuge, the list is endless. And on the other hand, self-promotion, shamelessly claiming to be a "genius" or "writer," and stealing the leftovers of others' saliva, while still feeling pleased with themselves, are also all kinds of strange phenomena of "nothing ugly is missing, and all evils are reached." Facing these heartbreaking facts, can we still deny the considerable truth of the saying "scholars without morals"? (Of course, I am not saying that all scholars are without morals.) Can we not feel the lamentations of "the way of the world and people's hearts"? Of course, my feelings are not without reason. To give a real example, there was someone named Zeng, who insisted on using nonsense like "who cares" and "playing mahjong" to practice his so-called "liberation of lyrics," and was rebuked as a "frivolous youth" and a "lustful eager of sex." Zeng babbled on and on, defending himself endlessly. Now, new facts have again proved that Zeng is not only a frivolous youth, but also a venomous and hateful snake. He can use Cui Wanqiu's name to brag about himself (see Cui's advertisement in this newspaper in February), and even forcibly assign a Japanese typist and a middle school teacher to be "female poets" and "university professors," praising himself meticulously; he can use the most despicable means to submit articles to tabloids, pointing out his friends as XXX and publishing their addresses, publicly selling his friends (see the 5th issue of Sino-Foreign Books and Newspapers News). Such boldness, such venom, such boredom, really makes me unable to believe that this is something that a "person" with a sense of shame and personality, especially a "scholar," can do. However, Zeng really can come up with it and really can do it. I think anyone cannot but admire Zeng's fearless spirit. I heard that Zeng is not very old and has not had the opportunity to study. I think if Zeng could put that kind of energy in bragging and flattering and that kind of venomous and ingenious mind into seeking real knowledge, wouldn't he gain more? However, Zeng insists on spending his days bragging and flattering, and spending his days creating rumors and slandering. This, on the one hand, makes Zeng's terribleness even more apparent, and on the other hand, it also shows the pity of youth being misled. However, to go back to the main point, even those who have received higher education may not necessarily be able to restrain themselves. For example, Zhang XX, who is famous for writing stories of triangular love and has made a fortune, often boasts of being from a certain school in Japan. However, he has also recently been yelling and cursing in some tabloids, with the face of a "rejected woman" full of hatred. He will scheme and slander, create rumors and provoke, and he will forcibly assign people to be like Bukharin or Lenin, simply wanting to put you to death. His despicable personality and vicious means can be said to be unprecedented. In this light, what is the use of higher education? There is also an article in a newly published boring publication signed "Bai Yuxia," entitled "Sitting in Uchiyama Bookstore," which openly says that someone often goes to Uchiyama Bookstore and has asked Uchiyama Bookstore to save their life and provide insurance. I think this kind of public informing is probably a trick played by second-rate people using pseudonyms. However, no matter how they spread rumors and slander, and no matter how they scheme and frame, discerning people will know at a glance that harming others will not work, but will only expose their own baseness and lack of personality. But, I think that "scholars" "with morals" really should not continue to ignore these ugly types as they do now, but should rise up and drive them out of the literary world. They should do a cleaning</p>

<p>Commercial News, Finance, Exchange Rates: Silver Prices and Commodity Prices Soar; Margin Trading Plummets to $1.30; Another New Low Price of $847.00</p>
<p>Since the gold market closure, overseas silver markets in the UK and US have generally risen. Exchange rates continue to surge. Forward silver prices on the metal exchange have also increased by 0.95 to 1.13 cents. American cotton has risen by over 20 points, and American wheat is up approximately 8 cents. Stocks are also up significantly. Private telegrams have risen by 1 cent. The United States has not agreed to stabilize currency. Raw silk prices initially opened around $50 (some offered within $40 but it was difficult to obtain, as $50 was immediately accepted on the 17th). Large firms such as Rui Xing and Fen Shou Wan Xing etc. were calming investors and eagerly covering short positions, so the situation stabilized after the opening. HSBC quoted British pounds up 1.25 and US dollars up 1.25. Although banks were resisting, the gold market mostly fluctuated. Additionally, the US market is closed tomorrow (the 5th), so there are no telegrams for silver prices and US/UK exchange rates, which many found comforting, believing the surge in US/UK exchange rates might not be as strong as that between the US and the UK. The after-market saw Bombay rise by one anna, with rumors of unfavorable conditions. The exchange market hardened, and speculator Mr. Wu came to supply, but his efforts were weak, and a new low price of $48.70 appeared. Later, Bombay's decline of one anna allowed it to rally. The day's process was mediocre. Jewish merchants and speculator Mr. Wu supplied more forcefully. Rumors of worsening Russo-Japanese relations were unconfirmed. Red prices increased by $1.25 to $25.00. The day's market conditions are detailed below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was $854.80, a sharp drop of $20 from before the closure. Commodities opened at $4.20. Wan Xing, Heng Yu, and Heng Xing all made purchases, and prices gradually rose from $4.00. The initial selling price in the exchange market was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 0.1875 for immediate UK exchanges and $28 for US exchanges, at which point it suddenly became difficult to settle, rising to $7.00. Chartered Bank and Wayfoong continued to sell October US dollars at 5.625, but this price again proved difficult to sell, and the trend became uncertain. Rui Xing, Shun Li, Fu Yu, and Heng Tai all came to sell, and the price fell to $2.50. Chartered Bank offered October US dollars at 6.25, and the decline was halted, gradually rebounding. Banks emerged with September US dollars at 4.375 and 3.75, seemingly rising, but in an instant, 3.125 was hard to settle. Yuan Chun, Wan Xing, Yuan Heng, Zhao Feng, Chang Yong Feng, and others bought strongly, raising the price to $8.00. Chartered Bank sold September US dollars at 2.5, plus advance knowledge of a US dollar increase of $1.25 and a UK increase of 1.25, so it retreated within $5.00. When the quotes were announced, prices hovered between $6.00 and $7.00 for a long time, calming the market. Chartered Bank bought October US dollars at 4.375, and Fu Chang and others bought up to $7.80. Heng Xing and Heng Yu supplied at a reduced price of $5.80, with limited trading. Shun Li, Da Xing, and Yong also came to sell September US dollars at 2.5 and October US dollars at 4.375, both proving difficult to settle and rising to $7.50. Wayfoong sold September US dollars at 1.875. The noon close was $856.40. Commodities closed at $6.50.</p>
<p>The after-market opened at $855.80, and commodities opened at the same price, because Wan Xing sold at the quoted price before opening, causing retail investors to reduce their bids. Later, Hong Li and Shun Li jointly sold, and Wayfoong released September US dollars at 2.5, and Bank of China offered October at 4.375, causing the price to fall from $6.50 to within $5.00. Although banks took in small amounts of October half-dollars, peers wanted to sell but couldn't. Yuan Sheng, Yong Qian, Chang Xiang, and Rui Kang sold at $3.00, and short-sellers covered, pushing it up by more than one dollar. But Bombay reported a rise of one anna, with unfavorable rumors, causing selling to surge. Zhi Feng Yong, Tian Feng Yong, Shun Li, Da De Cheng, Yuan Mao, Chang Sheng Yong, sold down to $0.05. Heng Yu bought slightly, pushing it back up to over $2.00, but large firms seemed to be forceful in supplying. Chartered Bank wanted 6.875 for October US dollars, but it was difficult. Qian Chang Xiang, Heng Yu Qing Fa, and Yong Fen sold, breaking through the $50 barrier to $48.70. Yuan Mao and Yong bought commodities while they were low. Zhi Feng Yong also bought. At this time, Chun Yuan Yong, Run Chang Yu, offered limited supplies, struggling around $50 for a time. Finally, Bombay returned to a small one anna decline. Joseon took in October US dollars at 6.25, gradually rising. Yuan Heng also entered, reaching $54. The closing price was $853.50. After the market closed, commodities rose sharply, closing at $6.00. Dealers from Dalian and Heng Yu Qian Chang Xiang sold, and even $5.50 was difficult to sell. The highest price for the day was $858, and the lowest was $848.70, a fluctuation of $9.30. The result was a close down $21.30 from before the closure.</p>
<p>Quoted prices increased because HSBC increased the US dollar exchange rate by $1.25 to $27.625, equating to a margin price of $868.78. Based on the closing price, this was approximately $15 over, less than $12 over from before the closure. This month's booked price was $866, and August's was $856. The morning top-up water price was $866, and the afternoon price was $864. The red price increased by $125 to $130. There were buyers but a lack of supply in the market, and swapping was quiet (commodities were discounted $9.40 from the 93rd to the 17th of July/August). 2,597 forward contracts remained this month.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal. In total, Rui Xing (Jewish merchant George Joe) sold nearly 1,000 contracts. Shun Li Bing, Rui Kang Heng Tai, Hong Li, Qian Chang Xiang, Hong Li Chang, Sheng Yong Qing Fa Yong, Yuan Mao, Da De Cheng, Zhi Feng Yong, Chun Yuan Yong, etc., all sold. Wan Xing Yuan Heng, Yong Feng, Zhao Feng Chang, Da Xing Yong, Yi Feng, Yong Fu Chang, etc., all bought. Commodity hedging also heavily favored the buy side. Dalian bought 560 contracts in the morning session, with little change in the afternoon. Shun Li took a slight deposit in the morning session and sold over 500 contracts in the afternoon session. Guang bought and sold over 400 contracts in the morning session, with very little in the afternoon. In August, a total of 20,713 chips were counted.</p>
<p>The numbers of contracts that had been concluded by each firm up to the close of the market showed that Dalian and Shunli Wanxing were together holding over 8,484 contracts. In addition to that, Yuanheng held over 2,300, Yifeng Yongyuansheng and Run Changyu were all over 1,000, and Hongxing Run Changyong also had over 500 contracts. Ruixing Bingxing Changshengyong Yuanmaoyong and Huixiang were each short by over 1,000 contracts, Qian Changxiang by over 800, Taifengcheng by over 900, and Sen Changyong Tong Dazhengyong Tongfengheng were each short by over 700 contracts. The number of chips seems to be decreasing. New York Silver Prices Soar; Foreign Exchange: British Flat, American Firm</p>
<p>Since the market closure, London's near and far terms have risen by 0.1875, American silver by 0.01125, British relative to American by 0.1325, and American relative to British has increased by 0.22. Forward silver prices have also risen by 0.95 to 1.13 cents. The morning opening price for near-term sales was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 0.1875 or 0.25 for British exchanges and $28 for US exchanges, making British flat and American firm by 0.08125 compared to before the market closure. The post-opening situation fluctuated. HSBC quoted British pounds up 1.25 and US dollars up 1.25. The subsequent process was extremely smooth, with a slightly tighter underlying trend. Subsequent market transactions were still weak, and banks continued to resist. The first telegram from Bombay reported a rise of one anna and rumors of deteriorated Japanese-Russian relations, making it extremely hard for a time. Speculator Mr. Wu also resisted selling. Subsequently, the telegram from Bombay reported a drop of one anna, and the market stabilized again. The closing selling price for near-term sales was 1 shilling, 3 pence, 0.25 for British exchanges and $27.9375 for US exchanges, making British flat and American firm by 0.075 compared to before the market closure. The banking sector, including Bank of China, Chartered Bank, Wayfoong, and Chartered Bank, were all resisting. Transactions were not strong, and small amounts were plentiful. The gold industry occasionally saw scraping and resisting, with an estimated scrape of 400,000 to 500,000. Before the market, Wayfoong took in September at 0.558. The day's transactions are recorded below.</p>

<p>For days, banks have been closing for the half-year settlement period, according to custom, for three days, which has caused the market to be particularly desolate. It was not until yesterday that all businesses reopened, so all Chinese and foreign banks and money shops were busy processing uncompleted procedures and new receipts. The atmosphere was invigorated. Looking at the business aspect, the trade in goods was also more active than last week. It is said that the Yangtze River water level is gradually returning to normal, and there is a large amount of activity in shipping. The inflow and outflow of funds will inevitably increase. As for the market's trading conditions yesterday, call money was done at 7%, slightly better than the previous day's 3%. Early and late prices were the same. For clearing house transactions, early market transfers totaled over 5.1 million, with new transactions of 1.3 to 1.4 million. Afternoon market transactions totaled over 300,000, and transactions in the small general association totaled over 600,000. There was initially a market of 2-3% for adding water to head office checks, but due to the abundant supply and insufficient demand for head office support, the result was still white checks, and no one was interested. Most of the silver dollar pledge transactions for the end of the month and the half-year period have been completed, so there were many supplementary procedures yesterday. As a result, there were a total of over 3.4 million in returns and new transactions. The inflow and outflow of banknotes, both recalled and issued, totaled 2.8 to 2.9 million. Bank receipts were even busier. Foreign firms received 3.7 to 3.8 million in silver for receipt tickets, 4.4 to 4.5 million in silver dollars, and over 2 million in silver and 3.1 million in silver dollars for settlement procedures. Special receipts totaled 3.5 million in silver. Various goods, remittances, pledges, telegraphic transfers, and other receipts totaled between 5.9 million and 6 million in silver and 4.8 to 4.9 million in silver dollars. 500,000 in silver and 400,000 in silver dollars went into storage. Chinese banks received 5.6 to 5.7 million in receipt tickets, over 4 million in settlement procedures, and over 7 million in various tax pledges, remittances, goods pledges, and other receipts. Special receipts totaled 4.8 to 4.9 million. 600,000 went out of storage. Japanese banks had 300,000 in silver and 800,000 in silver dollars go out of storage. Money shops received over 48 million in public dollar receipts, over 13 million in head office check receipts, over 800,000 in various remittances, and 700,000 to 800,000 in cash receipts. Customer routes went down by 150,000, while sources went up by 400,000. Also, the Shanghai Joint Reserve Committee's clearing house exchanged a total of 12,923,213.91 silver dollars on the 4th, including 10,190,219.78 silver dollars and 2,732,994.13 silver dollars in remittance transfers. New Currency Gradually Flows into the Market</p>
<p>The new national currency, minted by the Central Mint, has already been minted in the amount of 3,100,050 yuan and has been successively delivered to the Central Bank for counting, from the day before yesterday, for distribution to various banks to circulate in the market. Yesterday, various people in the industry rushed to banks and money shops to exchange it, and trading has already begun in the market. Yesterday afternoon, the transaction volume was about 50,000 to 60,000 yuan, with transactions of several thousand yuan being common, and no huge amounts of millions of yuan being involved. Subsidiary Coins Stagnant, Slightly More Expensive</p>
<p>Yesterday, the price of small Jiangnan silver coins was 847.5 yuan in the morning market and 847 yuan in the afternoon market, resulting in an improvement of 2 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions totaled 9,500 jiao in the morning market and 5,000 jiao in the afternoon market. The price of small Guangdong silver coins was the same in the morning and afternoon markets, at 773.7 yuan, a decrease of 1.1 yuan compared to the previous day. Transactions totaled 115,000 jiao in the morning market and 45,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were short at 500 wen, for a total of 317,500 wen. Transactions totaled over 41,000 strings of wen. Securities and Bond Markets Shift to Stability</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the Chinese Securities Exchange gradually became peaceful. Sudden increases and decreases only followed the difference in the supply of chips to determine the market price's ups and downs. The 96 Public Bond also showed a sign of stability as trading gradually decreased. In the current environment shortly after the delivery and settlement, with no significant changes, the market price prospects may be turbulent for a while. The 96 bond may be an exception, as most speculators tend to focus on it because its fluctuations are frequent and more interesting. When the market opened yesterday morning, the atmosphere was chaotic, and trading was not much. The market price was slightly lower by one or two jiao. The 19 Rehabilitation Bond was slightly up by 0.15 jiao, and the 96 bond was down by 0.4 jiao. The lowest price reached 8.4 yuan, but the trend was rising from the low point and still showed signs of being lifted. In the second session, the bond market still saw an oversupply, and the price for bonds from the 11th of the month declined more sharply, falling by 0.1 to 0.4 jiao. The 96 bond had already stabilized. When the market opened in the afternoon, with few spot transactions, although there were not many buyers, the number of sellers suddenly decreased. From the 20th, there was a consistent return of one or two jiao to about half a yuan. The 96 bond also shifted to an upward trend due to this, suddenly rising by 0.75 jiao. Before closing, various bonds listed made up for the deficiencies of the upper session, rising by 0.3 to 0.4 jiao. Afterward, things also felt calmer, and the 96 bond also seemed to be stabilizing. As a result, except for gold long and gold short bonds, which fell slightly by 0.1 to 0.35 jiao, the rest rose slightly by 0.1 to 0.35 jiao. The 96 bond also only returned to a rise of 0.35 jiao. The total transaction volume was 9,800,050 yuan, including 10,000 yuan in spot transactions. Futures were still led by the 96 bond, totaling 2,785,000, followed by the Unified Salt Tax bond totaling 2,715,000, the Disarmament bond at 1,100,000, the 19 Customs Duty bond at 860,000, and the 20th issue and the Customs Duty bond at 1,395,000. The rest ranged from 10,000 to 200,000 or 300,000. New York Stock Market Gains Momentum</p>
<p>Sinfeng Foreign Firm reported that on Monday (the 3rd), New York stocks, wheat, and cotton gained momentum as President Roosevelt rejected currency stabilization and the US dollar weakened. Buying sentiment was strong and permeated the entire country. Telegram transmission was once 12 minutes behind. The total daily transaction volume was 6.72 million shares. The 4th was American Independence Day, and exchanges were closed for one day. The market conditions were at their highest at the close, so it is expected that the momentum from today will continue into Wednesday. The US Cotton Exchange reported that world cotton consumption in May totaled 2,212,000,000 bales, the highest peak since January 1930. In April, 2,032,000,000 bales were sold, and in May of last year, only 1,854,000,000 bales were sold. According to private reports from Washington, the success of reducing cotton fields is said to be inaccurate, so there is a possibility of a drop in American cotton. However, according to the common opinion of brokers, it will continue to rise. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks: 103.77, up 2.85</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks: 53.38, up 4.60</p>
<p>20 Utility Stocks: 36.45, up 1.51</p>
<p>40 Bonds: 86.74, up 0.33 Yarn and Cotton Margins: Yarn and Cotton Market Atmosphere Diffuse</p>
<p>The yarn market is calm, and the situation is again scattered. First, although factories have taken actions to suspend work, according to some sources, several factories have no intention of suspending work. Second, the actual demand is still sluggish, and all parties are still affected by the economic recession, so there is still no significant development in transactions. However, buyers rely on yarn factories suspending work to buy in, so the market is still firm. In short, the poor sales are inevitable and somewhat regrettable.</p>
<p>Cotton Margins Soften: When the cotton margin market opened in the morning, the market conditions were still good due to the rebound in American cotton, but the gold market was weak again, so the market sentiment was calm. Prices for each month fell by 1.2, 3, or 5 jiao. The afternoon was still weak, and prices for each month fell by 1.25 jiao. The total daily transaction volume was 28,100 bales. Hengchang sold 1,900 bales, Dachang 800 bales, Zhenda 700 bales, and Dafeng 850 bales. Chunji bought 850 bales, Mingde 750 bales, Yuanda 750 bales, and Rongxing 650 bales. The closing prices are as follows. Cotton Margin Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Account Balances October: 19.83, down 0.27, 272,100 July: 19.07, down 0.04, 383,300 November: 19.83, up 0.06, 105,050 August: 19.38, up 0.07, 646,600 December: 19.96, up 0.04, 78,850 September: 19.68, up 0.03, 758,850 Total: 3,197,750</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Stagnate: Current yarn sales are mediocre. The statistics of purchases by all groups for the day show that 780 bales were purchased. The market conditions were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Sichuan: 20, Mainland: 30, Ningbo: 10, Peers: 45</p>
<p>Guangdong: 630, Shantou: 15, Xiamen: 10, Nanjing: 10</p>
<p>The cotton market is calm, but although American cotton continues to rise, and the gold market is falling sharply, the calculations have not changed much. Market sentiment is still weak. However, there are many bullish investors. The current situation is still brewing. The market atmosphere is extremely diffuse.</p>
<p>Zheng Cotton Margins Calm: When the Zheng Cotton Margin market opened in the morning, the market atmosphere softened. Old cotton fell by 0.1 jiao, and distant cotton rose by 0.05 jiao. In the afternoon, prices for each month rose or fell by 0.05 to 0.1 jiao. The total daily transaction volume was 55,400 dan. Chunji sold 4,200 dan, Tongji 2,500 dan, and Suilong 1,000 dan. Yuanda bought 4,100 dan, Dafu 1,200 dan, Yuanxingchang 1,300 dan, and Yifeng 1,100 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Cotton Margin Closing Prices, Gains/Losses, Account Balances, Account Balances July: 47.5, down 0.02, 3523,500 November: 45.35, up 0.05, 138,500 August: 47.40, up 0.01, 768,800 December: 45.35, no change, 19,500 October: 45.50, no change, 152,700 Total: 601,000</p>
<p>Factory Demand Continuous: Demand for current cotton is still good. The source is estimated to be 50 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Lingbao Cotton 53.00 to 55.00</p>
<p>Yongan Factory took in 1,050 pieces of spot goods to be sent to the factory. American Cotton Suffers Drought</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton was initially active due to a lack of rain in the drought areas. The market was lively and firm. Later, it softened due to some bulls closing out their positions. As a result, spot prices rose by 0.10 points, and futures prices rose by 0.11 to 0.23 points. Liverpool cotton spot prices rose by 3 points, and futures prices rose by 6 points.

<p>Yesterday, the wheat market saw a trend of near-term weakness and distant-term stability in both the morning and afternoon after opening. Although the quoted price of foreign wheat saw a large increase, rising by 1.458 to 2.23 yuan, most people are concerned that the current stock of wheat is very large, and factories are rarely consuming large quantities. This kind of pressure is inevitable, so there was no movement in the near-term after opening, and the distant-term sentiment was slightly better, leading to a slight increase. In the afternoon, the spot market saw further short selling, making the near-term even weaker, and the distant-term also saw a softening. As a result, this month fell by 0.02 yuan compared to the previous day, August and September fell by 0.01 yuan, and October and November improved by 0.02 yuan. In the spot wheat market, medium and low-quality goods were further reduced by a huge amount of 0.1 to 0.15 yuan. A total of 30,000 bags of wheat arrived by truck and boat during the day. Factories responded slightly, allocating only about 10,000 bags. The trend is still unstable. The opening price for Tang wheat was 3.55 yuan, with lower grades down to 0.50 yuan. The Tang city wheat was 3.60 yuan, with lower grades down to 0.54 yuan. Straight Tang wheat was 3.55 yuan, with lower grades down to 0.40 yuan. Shuangfeng wheat was 3.40 yuan, and Kunshan wheat was 3.65 yuan, with lower grades down to 0.55 yuan. Standard Flour Stable</p>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market saw a generally stable trend in the morning after opening. The quoted price of foreign wheat again saw a large increase of 1.458 to 2.23 yuan. At a time when domestic and foreign grain prices continue to rise, the local market should naturally follow, but the situation is different, and the demand is also different, which has attracted some attention. Because it is currently the peak season for new wheat, and the previous foreign wheat inventory is very large, coupled with limited sales to customers, the goods have expanded and cannot rise. The trading in each session in the morning was not smooth, and the price was only slightly better. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, although there was a slight trend from July to November, there was a return to the major Dalian Yingkou and Andong groups, with slightly better business, and the market sentiment was brought up, better than the initial opening by nearly 0.01 yuan. Under the current circumstances, the market must be active in actual sales before there is hope for a stable turn. As a result, July and August improved by 0.015 yuan compared to the previous day, September improved by 0.0075 yuan, October improved by 0.01 yuan, November improved by 0.0175 yuan, and December improved by 0.015 yuan. Foreign Rice Falls in Price, Sells Well in Fujian and Zhejiang</p>
<p>New Imported Rice Samples Don't Match, Not Yet Opened</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market was slightly active, with sales in both Fujian and Zhejiang, but the market's activity was due to price cuts by the cargo owners. Xiaojiao and Saigon each decreased by 0.05 yuan, and then the Min and Wen groups purchased 1,000 bags each of Xiaojiao old rice and high-quality goods. The Yong group purchased 500 bags, and the local market purchased 200 bags. The price was reduced from 7.55 yuan to 7.5 yuan. The local market purchased 300 bags of No. 1 Saigon high-quality old rice, which was also sold by Anli and Lixing foreign firms. The price was 8.1 yuan and 8.05 yuan. After the price fell, the market was slightly active, and it is not yet known whether there will be further purchases today and tomorrow. As for the 60,000 bags of new Xiaojiao rice recently imported by Fojia Foreign Firm, the returned goods did not match the samples, and subscribers raised objections. The market also thought the price was not worth it, and it has not yet been sold. After the price cut the day before yesterday, Fujian and Zhejiang gradually made purchases. Yesterday, Wen and Tai went to Jiangxi for Wanjing and Nanjing for Xian rice, each purchasing over 400 bags. Lanzhou went to Hunan for Jing rice, 900 bags. High-quality Xiang and Gan rice were scarce. Only low-quality goods were sold. Wanjing was 7.65 to 7.4 yuan, Jing was 6.66 to 6.55 yuan, and Jingxian was still 7.2 yuan. The market is currently stable. North and South Goods: New Haikou Branches Already Opened</p>
<p>The new Haikou branches that arrived a few days ago have not been selling well, and the firms' prices are too far apart, resulting in multiple days of rejection. Yesterday, an agreement was reached. The price for Shuidong branches was 25 yuan, and the price for Jianzhuang branches was 16 yuan, with lower grades reduced accordingly. However, the current sales have not started, and the market is still weak. Sugar Market: Chaoqing Sugar Firms' Stockpiles Are Running Low</p>
<p>High Quality Qing Called 14 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, although the margin trading in the sugar market saw a weakening, the customs duty still needed about 1.9 yuan, so the trend was still flat. The Public Association's closing price for 24 coarse sand, white, and ordinary goods was 20.15 yuan, with some transactions. Holland's Red KNG also remained unchanged at 16.05 yuan. Factory prices were slightly tight. Zhenji's crepe white No. 1 was called at 19.5 yuan, China Goods No. 1 at 19.4 yuan, No. 2 at 2.2 jiao, No. 3 at 19 yuan, and No. 4 at 18.8 jiao. Firms in the Chaozhou and Guangdong regions released over a hundred bags of Hainan Red at prices of 13.7 to 13.62 yuan. Several thousand bags of Cambodian Red were continuously released at 16.3 yuan. Because the stockpiles of Chaoqing were running low, the firms were increasingly determined to defend prices. The asking price for high-quality Zhuang Qing was 14 yuan, but no agreement had yet been reached. Silk and Tea: Russian Firms Begin to Handle Gongxi Tea</p>
