<h3 id="c32">時評　徐埠金融恐慌感言仁 <a href="#c32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>徐州金融風潮發生以來。瞬着二週目前雖已有漸趨平復之象。然而社會經此浩刦以後。其元氣之必遭鉅創。殆爲吾人意料中事。</p>
<p>顧此次風潮之發生。實緣於近年以來。天災迭降。人禍相繼。以致内地商况市面。蕭條凋敝。金融周轉。早感不靈。最近徐埠南貨一業。以滬債之嚴厲催索。相率倒賬。於是雪上加霜。向之周轉不靈之金融。至是遂益覺無法調度。而金融業之内部。更感空虚。於是公裕銀號等七家私人紙幣擠兌之風。遂一發而莫可制矣。</p>
<p>據報載公裕銀號等七家所發行之私人紙幣。約共二百零八萬串。以每五串合一元計。則當在四十二萬元之譜。然而以上述七家之財産與賬目而合計之。則僅三十餘萬元。以之抵押。尤須折扣。放實核恐尚不及三十萬。較之發行票額。不足將達十餘萬元也。此種空頭錢票之收受者。大部分爲一般鄕農與小市民階級。平日以汗血之勞。換得些微收入。以維持一家數口之生計。一旦恐慌襲來。發生擠兌。大店拒用於前。小店倣行於後。市面流通。頓生阻滯。而票號當局。又無即時兌清之能力。試觀徐州兩週以來風潮洶湧之情形。則此二週内一般小民所受心身上之困。苦已可不言而喻。</p>
<p>考我國各地私家錢票之發行。最初原爲便利商賈。而亦皆具有確實之凖備。以故市面流通。信用卓著其後一般專圖自利之商人。以爲錢票在市上旣有堅强之信用。遂認錢票爲巨大利源之所在。而相率發行。此種錢票發行額旣無限制。而現金凖備又不充足。在發行之初。藉舊錢票之信用。而得暫爲維持。乃至破綻一出。即釀成極大之禍變。十餘年來。有職者輙大聲疾呼而思有以整理之。無如事實上每每官與紳商互相結合。以盡力維持其發行之檔。故十餘年來。明知此種私票。終必有釀成巨變之一日。但爲事實環境所限。而錢票之發行如放。即以此次徐州之錢票而。論曩日曾已有數度金融整理委員會之組織。然而仍不能除此積弊。可知今日徐埠風潮之造成。固非一偶然突發之現象也。</p>
<p>最近徐州風潮。雖已漸告平復。然而市上殘餘之紙幣。恐尚不在少數。奮發有爲之徐州行政當局。正將藉此大好時機。限令全數掃清。不使此土劣剥削之工具。再留人間。以維持大多數貧苦小民之利益。則今日風潮之發。生可成爲極有意義之歷史矣。且今後年調將臨。結賬期近。市上金融。必將更形緊張。目前擠兌之銀號。焉知其不將再整旗鼓。捲土重來。以備繼續保持其舊日之權利。此時之行政當局。尤須堅持態度。嚴防其再事發行。不然。前車覆轍。恐將再蹈。</p>
<p>最後吾人尤有一言爲地方當局告。今日市上私票之充斥。實不僅爲徐州一隅獨有之現象。大江南北。何處無之。在目前未發生恐慌之各地。實不能不有所預防。至少在可能範圍以内。發行應求愼重。準備應須充實。有備無患。庶不致恐慌來襲。而使徐州同樣之風潮。重見於他地也。</p>

<p>本屆上海女子籃球會、經三星期每晚之逐鹿、已於昨晚圓滿結束、甲組錦標爲兩江保持、東南仍居亞軍、乙組盟主、亦與往年無異、冠軍若强東、亞軍屬兩兩、昨晚最後兩組比賽、强南以二十九比九勝華東、美專以二十九比二十二勝江江、</p>

<p>此番參加者甲組六隊、乙組八隊、惟東南兩江兩體育師範則佔去六隊之多（每校三隊）、足兒滬上女校雖多、猶　能普及發達、但加入各隊、精神殊佳、自始至終、進行順利、一燕支節、棄權之事、更若絶無僅有、乙組中兩兩雖曾棄權一次、因路途遥遠、車行遲緩、加以馬路紅燈阻梗、至遲到一刻鏡而作棄權、實出於不得已耳、</p>

<p>生産敎育思想中國在歷史上、只有治術敎育、雖然「新敎育」的娘家、是注重生産的、但移植到中國來、所有理化工農等等、也都變成所謂「洋八股」、而成功治術的工具、但十七年而後因爲世界經濟的嚴慌、中國的市塲、固然爲列强所必爭、而國内的産業、又因列强經濟侵略的壓迫、而日襄落、國際貿易上的借貸表、更無法平衡、治術敎育的無裨國是、差不多是人人所能感到、於是敎育思想、乃由治術方面轉變到生産方面、生産敎育由以大倡、</p>
<p>鄕村敎育思想五四運動以後、各種政治上經濟上的學說主義輸入、激動了國人注意實際的社會問題、鄕村敎育亦漸爲敎育界人所重視、十二年後、江蘇省立各師範、及河南省立師範、都没有農村分校、逐漸人於實際的運動、十六年、南京曉莊學校成立、在鄕村敎育史上、開一新的紀元、十七年、各大學敎育學院、多設鄕村敎育課程、十九年、山東鄕村建設研究院成立、鄕村敎育於此更增一生力軍、在思想方面、數年來、雖有不少的主張、但歸納起來、只有二說、（甲）鄕村生活改造說、（乙）鄕村建設說、都各有其充分的新見解、但目的是在共促鄕村敎育之發達、毫無異樣、實地「幹」的精神、都堪佩服、</p>
<p>民衆敎育思想十六年、國民政府統一中國、根據中山先生喚起民衆的遺言、於是民衆敎育逐漸成爲黨化敎育内容之一、理論方面、固然鼓吹得很熱閙、實施方面、也都有相當的成績、我們認爲最有成效的、要莫中華平民敎育促進會、在河北定縣的平民敎育、和江蘇省立敎育學院、在無錫的民衆敎育、在敎育思想上亦可以這二處當做代表、但他們都是敎育者、認民衆敎育是改進鄕村的方法、對於它的效用、也極其重視以爲它其「超階級的、澈底的、根本的、小之可以解决個人的生活問題、大之可以正人心、易風俗、减少内亂、恊和萬帮、</p>
<p>民族復興敎育思想九一八而後、因外患的逼迫、國人對於民族主義的認許、乃更進一步、學術界討論、民族復興問題的人、也日見多起來、理論上比較有系統的、有羅家倫朱家驊兩氏、羅氏倡創造有機體的民族文化、以挽救中國現在的危亡、所謂有機體的民族文化、它最重要的含義有二、（一）必須大家具有復興中國民族的共同意許、第二、必須使各部份文化的努力、在這個意理下成爲互相恊調的、其方法、爲誠樸雄偉四字、次述朱氏之說、朱氏時任敎育部長、在九一八之後、對所民族復興的感覺、比他人尤切、七月公佈短期小學課程標準、就注重恢復民族精神、部編課本、且能實際上作到、十二月一日、發表敎育部人同來整理全國發育的說明、更詳申民族復興敎育的宗旨、他說、「中國現在、就整個民族言必須在敎育上注意民族復興、而後中國民族、才能自由、中國民族復興、必須有待於敎育者有二、（一）養成國民的民族觀念、（二）恢復國民的民族自信、只可惜尚未見有實施上的具體方案罷了、</p>

<p>—</p>
<p>文思是什麽東西，誰也没有看見過，但是每一個常在事文章的人，每論他們文章寫得好不好，總會感覺到世界上確是有這麽一樣東西，而且是一樣極神秘的東西，雖然有錢的人，有閑的人永遠是不會需要它的，可是對於寒士，牠却眞是一件不可少的寶貝。</p>
<p>古人嘗說：「文思大至，猶如泉湧。」把泉水來璧方文思，實在再確切不過了！牠是一件取用不絶的東西，有時候，興會淋漓，眞像山洪暴發一般的猝然而至，使你一提起筆桿，絲毫無阻滯的直瀉下去了。所謂倚馬萬言的好身手，眞是極可能的事。但是有時候，天旱地燥，水源忽竭，雖把一枝毛錐兒夾到了手裡，並已把上她的松烟墨磨得香噴噴地安在前面了，或者還坐着一張極舒服的摇椅，更把書室的門也關上了，無奈文思不至，任你怎樣搜索枯腸，怎樣冥思默想，眼前終於還是攤着一張白紙，到這個時候，眞和没有泉水的時候，硬要鑿山求飲一般的爲難。就是你把捲烟狂吸，糖菓濫嚼，也祇是徒然便宜了你的口舌而已。要想使文思因此而勃發，敢說是絶對不可能的！</p>
<p>我還有一層感覺。（也許别人並不這樣感覺，或竟和我的感覺截然相反，那我也就不能干涉了，不過我自已總是那樣感覺着罷了。）文思之有無，作文的人本身也是不能做主的：在歡樂愉快的當兒，照理說，文思似乎必能大暢而特暢了，然而往往顚倒没有；在悲鬱憂憤的當兒，照理說，文章是决計做不成的了，然而事實上每因此而激發你的文思，使你在自已也不防備着的時候，寫出了極好的文章來。從前人常說：「做詩作文，窮而後工。」確是不錯的話！又有人說文書的是否暢達，應以其人的學識爲標準，這是尚未瞭解或認識文思究竟是怎樣的一件東西的緣故。我們要知道文思决不是跟金錢相同的，有了錢儘可以買醉買笑，任所欲爲，有了文思，却不能隨你支配，它是絶對自動的，絶對神秘的，牠不湧上來時，你縱有滿腹珠璣也不行！</p>

<p>— 君惕</p>
<p>上海是摩登的發祥地，又是摩登的集中點。你狞到馬路上，處處可以看見動物和靜物的摩登美。當然，只有動物的摩登美，可以震動你的心絃，勾引你的魂魄；但是也有一種摩登動物，使你得到異樣的感覺。</p>
<p>你常常看到一種女人，剪了髮，搽上脂粉，戴上眼鏡，穿上旗袍，着上皮鞋，這的確伊是摩登了。但你先鎭壓着心靈，再仔細一看，便知到伊頭髮已經花白了，臉皮已經起縐了，眼睛已經乾枯了，腰幹已經彎曲了。而伊的一雙脚呢，還是三寸金蓮，一鈎斜月。再看伊走路呢，那更妙了，不是嬝嬝婷婷，竟是摇摇擺擺。眞的，伊並不願摇摇擺擺，而要學嬝嬝婷婷，無奈伊因爲小脚所累，力不從心，就不得不摇，不得不，擺伊的確是老太了。</p>
<p>當我看到這一種摩登動物時，不由的打個寒噤，可不知到别人怎樣？伊自已又怎樣？但無論如何，伊是摩登，而又是老太；我不敢淹滅事實，所以替伊上一尊號摩登老太。</p>
<p>不過你放眼一看，摩登老太，不但馬路上有，世界上也有。伊丨世界上的丨已經實行民主了，而王公還存着；伊已開辦學校了，而私塾還存着；伊已努力建設了，而草棚也還存着……還有的說不盡了。伊這種形像，與你在馬路上所見的，眞有異曲同工之妙。唉？這是摩登嗎？簡直是矛盾！</p>
<p>唉！摩登老太們！你剪了髮，還得要塗些烏油；你搽上脂粉，還得要醫好縐紋；你戴上眼鏡，還得要添些秋水；你穿上旗袍，還要伸得直駝背；你着上皮鞋，還得要放大小脚。不要只顧現代的摩登，忘記自已的老太，使看見你的人們，打個寒噤，那就强似吃齋念佛了。</p>
<h3 id="c233">禁準美人 <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 俞人偉</p>
<p>在美國好萊塢的電影界裏，有一種專門人員，他們别的一些不管，只在女明星的身上用功夫。據說：他們費了一年多的光隂，研究出一種理想的美女標凖；如果有誰合着這種評定的標凖的，就可稱爲世界的標凖美人。這一種嚴格的標凖，是包括着一定的身材的長短，腰圍的粗細，大腿的肥瘠，臂部的大小，體重的份量，與膚色的深淺。可是，直到現在，好萊塢并不曾找到他們所謂理想中的標凖美人。</p>
<p>我說這種人眞是吃了飯没事做，才會這樣無意識地優幹。慢說美國好萊塢一隅的地方不會找到，就是踏遍了全世界找一輩子也是枉然。况且美的標凖，只好意像，不可確定；我的心目中的理想美人，未必就是你的心目中的理想美人；在菲洲熱帶地方知識未開的黑人，他們的女子，在我們的眼中看來，慢說談不上美，簡直醜的有些可怕，但是在菲洲土人的男子的心目中，伊們未嘗不是他們理想中的標凖美人。</p>
<p>且說咱們中國的美人，自古迄今，着實産生了不少。不過因爲時代的變遷，美人的標凖，也跟着轉變。在古人眼光中的標凖美人，是一個弱不勝衣，多憂善感的林黛玉式折肺病美人；在現今二十世紀的中國，因着歐化東漸，摩登男女，樣樣式式，多要學點洋派。在古時肺癆式的病態美人，很顯著地已經跟着潮流而淘汰，而野玫瑰式的赤脚女子，乃乘時崛起。雖然，有的婦女，根本没有强健的體格，好在現在科學發達，可以拿人工來改造，况且化裝物品，樣樣齊備，伊們髮的美，不用說，理髮師是可以包辦的：臀部的美，可以穿高跟鞋造成的；乳房的美，可以用橡皮假乳房來裝成的；其餘如蛇一般的扭動，可以在十分鐘之内畢業的，所以現在都市裏面，簡直滿街都是標凖美人，我們的詩人，大概不着「生的曼托」了　！</p>

<p>桂枝却把臉繃得很緊，向他道：二爺，這過去了的事，還提他作什麽？人只有向前着，那有向後看之理？積之聽了他這話，臉上不免紅了一陣，於是乎彼此都默然了。在這默然的時候，乘長途汽車的客人，已經紛紛的走入候車室裏來。兩個人又是隔了屋子中間，很大的空當，對面對坐了說話的，當然不像是有什麽關係的人。一男一女，在没有關係的情形之下，不便怎樣的說話了。坐了約莫有十分鐘之久，外面有人摇鈴賣票，桂枝正待起身，積之就搶着站起來道：賣票的地方亂着啦，讓我去買票罷。他說着話，人已經是走出候車室去了。他已經走出去了，桂枝當然不能上前攔阻。可是當積之掏錢買票的時候，心裏這就想着，買一張票呢？買兩張票呢？自已說要到海甸去，那是一句假話。到海甸去作什麽？看望哥嫂嗎？自已還没有發財呢？送桂枝回家去馮？交情又夠不上了。但是旣然答應他是到海甸去的，這當然不能不去。要不然顯着自已是有心撒謊了。於是也就買了兩張車票，引了桂枝一同去，汽車。這長途汽車的車身，是非常之高的，必定要在車邊放着一條小凳子，然後才可以踏住車凳子，鑽進車門子裏去。積之踏上凳子，一脚就登上了汽車。可是桂枝也來登上車門的時候，他身體矮小一點，試了兩試，還不曾上去，積之還在車門口呢，情不自禁的就一伸手，把他拉上了車子來。當時桂枝不曾考量得，就抓着他的手上來了。（二五一）</p>

<h3 id="c236">巴黎發明唇相 <a href="#c236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>我們平常祗知道看相的人，以骨相手相兩種方法，判斷人的善惡禍福。最近巴黎心靈學者，發明了嘴唇相法，他們對於嘴唇的形狀，分爲六種：第一種爲圓形的唇，是表現傲慢自尊心很强的，第二種爲半圓形的唇，是證明空想優柔不斷的，第三種爲平形的唇，是富於感情最貪色慾的，第四種爲尖角的唇，是表現各種慾望很深的，第五種爲卵形的唇，是富於冒險性與懶惰近于藝術家的。我們不妨用鏡照照自已的唇，究竟屬於那一種，是否與上面所說的話相合？</p>

<p>德相希特勒爲鼓吹德國的精神，下令婦女不准化妝，倘若婦女燙髮畫眉塗脂抹粉，就不認其爲族類。他說：婦女的美，美在天然，假使用人工妝飾得妖艶，就可表現婦女們不正當的心理，吾黨集會時，如看出婦女中有化妝的，應當立卽鳴鼓而攻之。因此德國婦女們都不敢妝飾，全國的化妝品店，都要關門了。</p>

<p>土耳其的阿大那市，組織了美男子比賽會，與賽者的資格，以未婚的爲第一條件，審判員，爲年輕的女子，審定的方法，由各審判員把比賽人的眉目鼻口耳等五官的優美點，記出分數，投票公開評定，若是得了第一名，除了可得二萬元的奬賞外，還把阿大那市中第一名美人嫁給這人。聽說前次比賽時，第一名美男子，是一個小學敎育還未畢業的理髮匠，而第一名美女子是一位著名文學家美術家，其父爲大官的。</p>

<p>最近匈牙利首都布達佩斯某病院，死了一位患奇病的人，名呌史變開里，他在世界大戰時，任陸軍上尉，非常勇敢，他因在戰場飽受了敵彈的驚嚇，精神上大起變化，不能睡眠，雖則服了强烈的催眠藥，總不能一睡，傳說到了現在已有十六年不眠了。那病院自從他死後，把他的腦神經解剖，仔細研究其不眠的原因。</p>

<p>最近統計歐羅巴各國首都中，女性的人數大概比男性爲多。計柏林市男子一千人，女子有一千一百七十七人，倫敦市男子一千，女子有一千一百四十九人，維也納市男子一千，女子有一千一百六十九人，巴黎市男子一千，女子有一千一百九十五人，華沙市男子一千，女子有一千一百八十五人，布達佩斯市男子一千，女子有一千一百九十二人。惟法西斯蒂國意大利首都羅馬市，男性一千，女性爲九百七十一人，布加利亞的沙非耶市，男性一千，女性祇有八百九十四人。他如紐約市男子一千女子爲九百九十九人，芝加哥爲九百七十二人。所以歐羅巴已成爲女性的天下了。這是世界大戰時，男子多在戰場死亡的結果。</p>

<p>法國有一位青年，名呌納士比德與華那姑娘結婚後，不到二年，因華那姑娘中途變心，提出離婚，可是華那姑娘向法庭要求贍養金五萬元，而納士比德雖是議員的兒子，富有財産，因爲與華那姑娘結婚時，講明何人變心，由何人每天給罰金一分，所以法庭照結婚條件，判决納士比德每天給與一分的贍養費了。</p>

<h3 id="c269">袁中郎的紀遊文 <a href="#c269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>— 朱霞</p>
<p>遊記的寫作雖無「定法」，實際上，可說是有一種「死法」的。這「死法」是什麽呢？就是抱住了景物去寫實，加上若干的抒情的感想，而且要有起有訖，使成爲完整的大文章。古往今來，寫遊記的人，無形中被這個「死法」所束縳，竟少有新的發展。然而，中郎的紀游文，却不能不說是便外。全集中的雜文一卷，收的全是紀游的文章，而這些文章，都是另有一種精神，另有一種體制的。有時，他也寫寫當前的景物，有時對於題目所限定的景物，是一個字也不寫，只記下他在這裏的感想。有時，一個大題目，他却寫上幾句話，而小題目，他反而長篇闊論。這樣獨特的精神，我覺得是每一個紀游文的作者，應該很好的學習的。死抱住題目兜圈子，無論如何，不能不說是最笨拙的方法。</p>
<p>譬如中郎紀游文之最爲人所傳誦的「虎邱」吧。在一般的作家，當然是以叙述虎邱的景物爲主，而中郎則恰恰相反，關於景物，祇用很少的字略略的點到而已。他的重心，却放在游人的游興上，寫游人的盛裝，寫游客的「置酒交衢間」，寫「檀板垢積，樽罍雲瀉」，寫歌唱，寫動作，寫石光明，寫筆管。這麽一來，不僅是愈見虎邱之勝，也把「死」虎邱寫成「活生生地」了。雖不正面寫虎邱的景色，而無往不是寫虎邱，它的景物，它的日景和夜色，它的活躍的生命。紀游文，和其他的文字一樣，能夠抓住它的重心，側面寫，有時比正面來得更有力量。再如他的「百花洲」一文，他一點也不正面的寫「百花洲」，他只用一個對話來說明它。我可以引用它的全文：</p>
<p>百花洲在胥盤二門之間。余一夕從盤門出，道逢江進之。問百花洲花盛開否，蓋往觀之？余曰：「無他物，惟有二三十糞艘鱗次綺錯，氤氛數里而已矣」。進之大笑而别。</p>
<p>這種寫法，我認爲是最有生命的，是記遊文中足以表現作者自已的。雖不正面的寫「百花洲」，但在如此美妙的名字下面的醜惡實况，是會使人得到深刻的印象的。又如他寫西湖，所應用的寫作方法，也是如此，他並没有寫有系統的西湖遊記，祇是斷片的寫，而每一斷片，却有它不同於一般的獨立存在的地方。如「西湖一」起始一段：「從武林門而西，望保叔塔，突兀層崖中，則已心飛湖上也」，一起就有了特殊的精神。如「孤山」一題；</p>
<p>孤山處士，妻梅子鶴，是世間第一種便宜人。我輩只爲有了妻子，便惹許多閒事，撇之不得，傍了可厭，如衣敗絮，行荆棘中，步步牽掛。近日雷峰下有虞僧儒，亦無妻室，殆是孤山後身。所著溪上落花詩，雖不知于和靖如何，然一夜得百五十首，可謂迅捷之極。至於食淡參禪，則又加孤山一等矣。何代無奇人哉！</p>
<p>簡直是丢開孤山，而寫孤獨的人。其他類此的正多。如「龍井」一題，他所寫的重心却是茶。但中郎，也並非絶對的不寫風景，在很多的地方，對於景物，也很用力量。不過，他是完全根據必要；不必要的地方，他是放棄的。這原則，我們應該注意。西湖諸文之中，有一篇「湖上雜叙」，我覺得是最好的，在短短的文字之内，冩盡了四個月，三次的遊踪，殊非易事。然而他仍舊是倒重着生活寫。事物，在必要的地方，他也用力描摹。有一篇「湘湖」，就是寫蒓菜的。再看他的「釣臺」篇：</p>
<p>釣臺兩石相對，高不餘丈。不知當時用幾許竿，釣得幾斤魚也。嚴翁無用，與此臺何異？然其壁立千仞，傲倪人主，不顧峻絶，亦與石頭等矣！</p>
<p>這簡直是一篇諷剌的議論文了。中郎的文章，很多的地方，是這樣獨抒已見的。他的記遊文，其主要的特點，也就在此。我所以提出來的原因，並非是根本上反對記遊文中叙述景物，而是主張記遊文應具有更豐富的生命，若果單單的叙述景物，無論怎樣的佳妙，是算不得有生命的文章的。</p>
<h3 id="c270">老祖母的癟奶頭 <a href="#c270" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e270" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">270</a></h3>
<p>— 何家槐</p>
<p>在熱天，祖母老是掛着一雙癟奶頭，把一件衣服褪在背後。她袒露着胸膛，一面用口哨呼風，一面拚命地摇着麥桿扇子，把光隂消磨在菜園，弄堂，以及附近一帶所有的風頭口。但大部分時間，她却還是喜歡坐在那條靠近大門的石凳上面，剥一點荳芽，或者撚一點棉線。「有客，有客！」</p>
<p>我時常這樣頑皮地騙她。</p>
<p>「别說謊，嚇我不壞的，客來又有什麽關係呢？」</p>
<p>「他們會笑你赤膊呀！」</p>
<p>「老人家赤膊没有妨礙。」</p>
<p>看見我儘是蹦蹦跳跳，彷佛很使她快活，因爲她時常出其不意的拖住我，親我的臉，搔我的手心，笑着說：</p>
<p>「嘗嘗你祖母的奶吧。」</p>
<p>「不要，不要，我要吃姆媽的媽！」</p>
<p>我固執地摇頭，這樣乾癟的一雙奶頭，那裏來的奶？母親的奶才多哩，像噴水似的，簡直一射出就不容易止住。</p>
<p>「小畜生，你總有一天吃我的奶！」</p>
<p>「爲什麽？」</p>
<p>「現在不要問，你等着看好了。」</p>
<p>「讓爸爸吃吧。」</p>
<p>「偏偏要你吃！」</p>
<p>我從没有把這事放在心上，孫子吃祖母的奶，究竟是少有的事。</p>
<p>可是她竟說中了。在一個鬱熱的午後，母親忽然對我說：</p>
<p>「寶寶，你要戒奶了。」</p>
<p>「我要吃！」</p>
<p>「站起來這麽高了，還吃奶，不要羞死人？」</p>
<p>「可是我要吃，媽媽！」</p>
<p>「人家嘲笑怕不怕？」</p>
<p>「躱在房裏吃，人家不會看見的。」</p>
<p>我絶不聽話，以爲她騙我她玩，所以不但不答應戒奶，而且要她馬上解衣服，馬上給我吃一頓。</p>
<p>「眞的不能再吃了，你看丨」</p>
<p>母親笑着解開了鈕扣，露出了兩隻奶頭，竟是血紅的。</p>
<p>「是什麽東西？」</p>
<p>我哭着問，感到很大的失望。</p>
<p>「辣醬。如果你不怕嘴巴辣破，儘管來吃！」我放聲大哭，幾次想去吃，可是那辣醬眞是怕人！</p>
<p>「今天塗辣醬，明天我還要貼上膏藥，你不怕嘴巴黏住也可以來吃。」</p>
<p>從此我竟不敢再去糾纒母親，老祖母的那雙癟奶頭，却成爲我的Ｆavorite了。因爲這時母親回娘家去住，我惟一的伴侣，就是祖母。雖則我知道她的癟奶頭没有一點奶水，我却成天摸它們，而且很有滋味似的，嘖嘖有聲地吮吸；晚上跟她睡，也像以前每晚都要捧住母親的奶頭一樣，一定要含着這雙癟奶頭才能睡覺。彷彿這樣才能夠過癮。</p>
<p>「有没有奶，寶寶？」</p>
<p>「一點也没有！」</p>
<p>開始我的確感到啜乾奶頭的乏味，可是以後也漸漸習慣，而且似乎非常滿足了。</p>
<p>人類原是從小就能「將就」的。</p>
<h3 id="c271">關於「現實的認識」（續） <a href="#c271" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e271" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">271</a></h3>
<p>— 徐懋庸</p>
<p>至於這一回的「現實的認識二文的論旨，簡直使我莫明其妙。首先，侍桁先生說我和他的意見的殊異在乎：我是「把藝術的機能看成爲攝影機」而他是「把藝術看成「畫家的筆，顔料以及畫布」。但我的看法是機械的。我的看法到底是否如侍桁先生所說的那樣，且不說。且看他自已的罷；「如果畫家的腦裏發生了一個意象，雖然面前並無實際的摸特兒，他的人物的製造仍然可以是同樣地眞實的」。這固然不錯，但是我們的高明的畫家腦中的意象，到底自何而生的呢？倘若說，這個意象，是根據曾經見過的實際的摸特兒的記憶而構成的，那麽，畫具和照相機實際還是一樣，總得有一個實物作對象，不過畫家作畫時，僅憑記憶也可能，不必把摸特兒擺在眼前，而攝影之際，即非把對象放在面前不可。然而，要是根本上没有一個實際的東西，則影固無從攝，但畫師的意象也不是無從發生麽？就以沙寗來說罷，若社會上本有這樣的人，則無論是攝影機或畫具，都能作出他的肖像來。但是實際上這樣的人竟是没有，所以縱有高明的攝影師和畫家，也不能作出一個正確的肖像。所以我說：「道與藝術製作力無多大關係」。侍桁先生反對我的話，難道他以爲阿爾志跋綏夫的藝術製作力再高明點，就可把沙寗變無爲有麽？在後面，侍桁先生把「預言家」這個頭銜，加到屠格湼夫頭上去，且引「父與子」的事實作例。我以爲是可笑的。我相信存在先於思維。屠格湼夫「從現實中捉取」巴札洛夫的「雛型」時，巴札洛夫的「雛型」實已在現實中存在，别的人看不到，是别的人的眼光不及屠格湼夫「深䆳」之故。屠格湼夫眼光「深䆳」，比衆人先看到這個雛型，於是說了出來。他若不說，這個雛型仍然要長成的，但這長面，是社會的客觀條件使然，並非屠格湼夫的藝術製作力使然，侍桁先生說屠氏「以其藝術的表現的正確、使這種雛型漸地成長着，俄羅斯的社會終歸出現了巴札洛夫的類型的人」，這簡直把屠格湼夫說成一個上帝，是他的藝術製作力使俄羅斯社會出現巴札洛夫！據此以論，阿爾志跋綏夫不能繪俄羅斯社會創造現實的沙寗型的人，則其藝術製作力，誠可謂薄弱矣！</p>
<p>我對於文藝，太少研究，從文藝的立塲來和侍桁先生討論，眞是班門弄斧，豈敢豈敢！我所把持的是一點平常的道理，這道理使我相信，藝術家不能憑幻想的「意象」造出一個「歷史上的典型人物」，不管他的藝術製作力怎樣高妙。我相信對於一個作家現實的正確的認識比藝術的正確的表現更其重要。因爲，有正確的認識而無正確的表現，其「毁壞」也猶如刻鵠不成而類鶩，若認識不正確而藝術製作力太高妙，其失敗也，則如畫狗不成而類虎矣。</p>
<p>何况，根本不會現實，故存在的事物，認識將何從？表現又將何從？</p>
<h3 id="c272">兩兄弟（四十二） <a href="#c272" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e272" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">272</a></h3>
<p>— 莫泊桑著　李維克譯</p>
<p>「從那一國來的？」</p>
<p>「意大利。」</p>
<p>「從那個口岸來的？」</p>
<p>「那卜勒斯。」</p>
<p>於是筆爾彷彿覺得他那迷亂的眼前現出了維沮微（Ｖesuve意大利火山）的羽飾似的噴火，同時在這火山脚下，在梭郎特或加斯特拉瑪的橙樹林中，飛翔着許多螢虫！他曾夢想過多少次這些熟悉的名字啊，好像他就認識這些地方的風景似的！啊！他眞恨不得卽刻動身，不論到什麽地方，並且永不回來，永不寫信，永不讓人知道自已的狀况！不行，他得回去，回到父親的屋裡，睡在自已的牀上。</p>
<p>罷了，他不回去，他要等到天亮。他覺得汽笛的呌聲頗爲悅耳。他又站起身，開始走着。好像一個輪着夜班的船員在甲板上走着一樣。</p>
<p>另一隻輪船緊接着第一隻船進來了，這船現着偉大和神秘的樣子。這是一隻從印度開來的英國船。</p>
<p>他還看見好幾隻船進來，一隻一隻地從那濃黑的隂影中走了出來。隨後，因爲受不住霧的濕氣，筆爾便往城裡走。他冷得不能不走進一家水手們坐的咖啡店去喝一杯格洛格（Ｇrog熱的糖水，燒酒，檸檬等合成的飲料）；當那辣且熱的燒酒燙着他的喉嚨時，他覺得自已又有了一個希望。</p>
<p>他也許猜錯了罷？他狠懂得自已那種無理的空想的！他一定猜錯了？他像人家編製一個公訴狀控告一個「欲加之罪不患無辭」的無辜者一樣積了許多證據。等到他睡着了，他便不會這樣想的。</p>
<p>於是他回家去睡，並且因爲他决欲入眠，他終於假寐了。</p>
<p>五</p>
<p>可是醫生的身體僅祇在一個非常不安的睡眠裡得到一兩個鐘頭的麻痺。當他在那暖熱的，閉得緊緊的，闇黑的房間裡醒轉來時，連他的思想還没有開始活動，他便感到了那痛苦的壓迫，那在睡夢中暫時忘却的，悲哀過後所感着的不快。在當晚還祇和我們撞了一下的災難，彷彿在我們睡着的時候，溜進了我們的肉裡似的，像一種熱病一樣把人毁壞，使人困倦。突然他又回憶起來了，他坐起在床上。</p>

<h3 id="c273">命運 <a href="#c273" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e273" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">273</a></h3>
<p>— 琴</p>
<p>爲着航空公路奬劵的二次開出，於是「命運」之說又到處可以聽到了。</p>
<p>張家媽媽說：「他有福氣，所以着了一個頭奬。」</p>
<p>李家嫂嫂說：「這是前世命裏註定的，勉强不得來。」</p>
<p>不差，五十萬分中掏一個希望，的確要靠些「碰」。</p>
<p>關於「命運」的話，記得曾在某一部筆記中見到一則故事，大意是這樣的！有夫婦二人，種田爲業，其夫極信命運，相士多說他命有天財，彼亦深喜不疑。一日從田間還來，告其妻謂適在田畔發現金元寶一甏，妻問爲何不取，彼答相士算其命有「天財」，此係「地財」，非所應有。其妻嗤之。二人爭吵之言，適爲鄰居所聞，急至田畔覓視，則所謂甏固在焉，揭視其中，盡屬小蛇，大恚，以爲彼夫妻實有意戲已，乃携至家中，乘夜揭彼夫婦所居之屋瓦，將蛇傾入，口呼：「天財來了，」思有以報之。詎蛇初傾下，彼夫婦在床聞聲驚起，亦大呼「天財來了」不止。鄰人在屋上，聞蛇傾下有叮噹聲，亦不自解，急急留住，甏内祇賸得金元寶一枚，不覺大笑，下巴因以脫落，及至醫好下巴，元寶適亦用完。這故事就在說明一切皆有「命」。鄕人信命該得天財，不取地財，終於假手他人，仍歸其所有，鄰人命中本無財，故元寶變而爲蛇，最後留得一只，終吃下巴脫落之苦，以懲一般人妄求福祿之罪。這故事流傳得非常之廣，而且這種說法也深入人心，大概可作「命運說」的具體的說明。</p>
<p>本來「靠天吃飯」，是中國人的人生哲學。升空不會想到坐飛機，只希望天上降下一朶彩雲；入水不會創造濳水艇，但願四海龍王來邀請，天旱則拜龍王，水漲則朝烏龜磕頭（最近黃河水漲，有大龜出現，河工人員爲之磕頭，見論語半月刊）祈禱禦外侮，禮懺可救國，一切刀兵水旱之災，統統委之天命，希望上帝搭救，而完全放棄了自已的努力，於是人也者，也就變做了一種不能創造或改變環境的動物了。這是誰的罪過？</p>
<p>但近年流年，大爲不利，直到今年「中國人的苦命是早已注定了的」之論出，於是人心更爲悽惶。幸而天運宏開，有航空奬劵之發行，使一般失望的人們，稍挽回一些希望。着上頭奬，便可面團團作富家翁，即不着頭奬而撈到一個二奬，也有坐汽車資格，而一跳跳出「苦命」之外。這樣三月一次（現在則二月），每次十數人以至數十人，一年之内怕不度得白十人以至數百人逃出此「苦命」之關。這眞是莫大的恩惠。雖然苦的將因此而更苦，而好的總也是有的。「碰」吧一這年頭，本來什麽都是碰着玩的！</p>

<p>— 小彭</p>
<p>經過一夜的劇戰，我軍終於勝利地前進了。據報敵人已經逃得遠遠的，後方的行李隊，也奉令緊隨着向前推進；有的用特口䭾，有的用牛車運，有的便是人挑，這是費了很大的氣力取用拉夫的方式抓來的。陽春三月的北地天氣，走起路來，熱烘烘的，荒凉的原野，漫山徧地，怖滿了行軍的箱篋舖蓋，更其是軍人的呌駡奔號，還夾雜着挑夫被鞭撻後拚命前去的「杭育」聲，以及狼突豕奔的牲口的喘氣哀鳴，浩浩蕩蕩，活像錢塘江中的一片努潮。約摸行了十來里地，便已到達先夜激戰的所在了。</p>
<p>因爲先夜不曾闔上眼，當天又趕了一段行程，大家肚子也還那麽空洞洞的，實在迫切需要着一個適當的休息了。這荒凉頽敗的村落裏，一會兒變成了整個的灰色世界，老白姓的東西，只要是可以下咽的，早已一掃而光。娘兒們眼巴巴地望着，成年以上的男子，鬼也見不到他們的踪影，這許是已經拜受過革命軍不拉夫的恩賜了。</p>
<p>一會，一間小茅舍的一個角落裏，簇擁着一大隊的各種兵士，層層包圍得水洩不通。「臊你奶奶，　死這些老文人，……」這一遍尖銳的呌駡聲，滙漫了這村莊的大地。我湊近去一瞧，啊，一具没頭没腦血跡斑斑的死屍横臥地上，狼藉的一些碎肉點綴着這室僅方丈的小屋，散出一股腥臭。另有兩個着灰軍裝的斜躺在兩勞，恰成了一個品字形，面色慘白，嘴裏泛出白沬，迸發着一些斷續的凄厲的哀音：「救命呀，老……老爺們丨」我當時便直覺地感覺這無疑是敗北不及逃退的敵兵了。</p>
<p>「我原在Ｘ總司令部下當兵，這次被圍在此地，來不及退出，我們山西人啦。最後那厮（血肉狼藉的死兵）心急了，便建議不如先行自殺，呌我們集聚一蜼，他把炸彈當頭一擊，他自已果眞揍死了，可憐我倆僅各自傷了一個腿子，路却不會走了，臊他祖宗，眞糟糕，……老爺，請救了我們呀丨　接着另一個帶着悲苦哀求的音調，使盡他平生之力氣，如怨如泣地顫聲訴說他們這次的遭遇，這　然是呌我們不要仇視敵人，别把那兩條喘的生命結束了。</p>
<p>可是，人類華竟是缺乏同情心的。這兩個同階級的傷殘了的弟兄，却仍不能燃起他們相憐的熱情，硬套上一副敵我的着色眼鏡，惡心的便想去揍，有些擎舉手裏的槍，殺氣騰地凖備實彈射擊，有的更提議用火油燒，經過我一度苦口婆心的解釋，也很難打破他們那仇視敵人的觀念，這最後的一幕悲劇，終於在「劈拍！劈拍！」的兩聲下出演着，而那兩條帶傷了的生命，畢竟不幸在敵人的罪名下被犧牲了。</p>
<p>這是三年以前的舊事了。</p>

<p>至於訪間女友吧，也是一件很疑難的事情呢？現在的女子們，雖然是已經自由了，解放了，男女平等了！可是吾們貴國的管仲之器的男子們，却仍是頑固不化的，大都未免二十一日酉時的作用，所以往往要閙出酸溜溜的風波來丨你如果到女學校裏去訪女友，或是到什麽機關公司裏去訪花瓶的話，那專司訪問之職的僕役，他們劈頭一句問你姓　，訪那個：第二句聞你啥稱呼！那時：你就覺着難於對答了。你說明友好呢？還是說表妹好？若是你吱唔其辭，對你不住，他們對你白了一眼，惡很很地說：正在上課，或是正在辦公的話來對付</p>

<p>— 孟遠</p>
<p>近來我常常受妻的敎訓。</p>
<p>例如我的晏起，吃酒，都成爲敎訓的資科；訓話的開始，總是輕淡描寫地一句，又由這一句而引起了别一句，及後又連帶地引起來一個問題，牽絲板藤的說個不了！最後的結果，不是哭便是笑，看我的如何對付而定。</p>
<p>有一次我偶然談起我那過去的情人翠，無意中我讚美了她幾句，但當時妻不作聲；停了一回，似乎又有訓話來了！因爲我讚美了翠的幾句話來作題材，在妻認爲不君子的，虧她借題發揮，於是輕淡描寫的訓話，便又開始：</p>
<p>「我看你近來學時髦，會得吸紙烟了！」</p>
<p>在我，照例是默不作聲，洗耳恭聽的，於是，下文接着又來。</p>
<p>「我眞不懂，把這樣辣辛辛的東西，吸吸進，噴噴出，到底有什麽意味？又不會飽，倒不如吃些點心來得强。而且……」</p>
<p>這「而且」二字，我知道她又纒到另一問題去了！那下文：</p>
<p>「而且，翠也吸香烟，女人吸香烟，我最不贊成；說起你又以爲得在誹謗她，不過她有時做的事，確也……」</p>
<p>這一頓，又轉到另一問題：</p>
<p>「你近來心機也太重了！吸烟罷了！還要想另外的事，也不正經地做文章，開口是女人，閉口是女人，心裏也整天想着女人。」</p>
<p>「想誰？」我忍不住了：「想你啊！」</p>
<p>「誰要你想？」妻本着正氣說：「我可不是同你開玩笑，我在替你發悉！」</p>
<p>「這不勞費心！你是在愁翠。」</p>
<p>「誰愁她？翠干我甚事？」</p>
<p>「翠和你你關係大咧！」</p>
<p>「得啦！不同你說，你這人現在變了！勸你也不聽；說你也不聽，」於是哭了！</p>
<p>訓話畢，我默然，在暗暗地低着頭咀嚼着妻方才的幾句話。</p>

<p>— 晋晋</p>
<p>住在二十二號裏的張老爺，聽說以前做過什麽知府官的，現在退隱家居，安享清福。家裏佈置得富麗堂皇，彷彿皇宫一般，充滿了富庶的氣象。張老爺除了這所大公館之外，還在别處打了好幾處小公館，一大半日子都流連在千嬌百美的姨太太處。這當然引起了大太太無限的憤恨和妒忌，但他自已的年齡已是不小色也衰了，實際上，再也難得維繫老爺一顆動盪的心。大太太也知曉到這一點，現在居然給他想到，一條對付的方策。</p>
<p>差不多每天早晨，我們都可以見到張公館裏的娘姨，出來到老虎灶裏去泡水，但這幾天却不見他出來了，另外一個很嫖緻的十三四歲小姑娘替代了娘姨的職務。她身材生得很苗條而阿婀娜雖還祇十三四歲，却也已很夠迷人了。衣服也穿得很新頴而華麗。這使我們很奇怪，始終猜想不出他究竟是誰來。說他是新來的丫頭吧，决不會穿　得這般齊整的，說他是他們的視省吧！更决不會呌他到老虎灶去泡水，介使我們如墮五里露中，尤其是喜管問事的妻，更急於知曉一個究竟，昨天午後，他在門外看見娘姨跑遇，便向她探詢消息，娘姨輕輕地告訴了她，這個悶葫蘆才打破。</p>
<p>大太太爲着自已年老色衰，難以維繫老爺的心，早就想自已去買一個美貌的女子來，給老爺做姨太太，這樣一來，自已將來對於這個姨太太，可以操縱自如，大權不致旁落，祇要得到老爺的歡心和寵愛，外面這些「野貨」處便不再會去了。但要買一個合意的美貌女子，煞是非易，年齡大些的美貌女子，往往自抬身價，非有一大筆金錢，難以買到，這當然是大太太所捨不得的，價錢便宜些的，面貌總是不嫖緻，難得老爺的歡心，這眞是大太太的一椿難題。這次恰有個姓趙的窮人，給債主逼得没法，祇得把女兒賣掉，那女子年齡雖還少些，可是生得千嬌百美，的確是一個尤物，價錢又很便宜，祇要五十元錢，所以大太太把他買來了，預備把他養上二三年之後，就要和老爺圓房，正式做姨太太了。</p>
<p>妻像獲得什麽秘密似的，很愉快地告訴了我之後，我們不禁發出一聲同樣的慨歎：</p>
<p>「呵！　來那是個候補姨太太啊！」</p>
<p>Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ　Ｘ</p>
<p>李小姐每天的生活是有一定的公式的，午前非到十一點鐘　例不起來　　來後洗臉撲粉，至少要一小時，午後不是玩麻雀，便是去看電影，夜聞照例是在跳舞塲裏，非至深夜是不歸的。</p>
<p>她今年十九歲了，美麗得彷彿天上豐下來的安琪兒一般，聽說曾在一家中學裏畢過業，會得寫幾封熱烈多情的情書，唱幾首情歌丨丨的是一個十足的摩登姑娘，震於她的美貌而拜倒於她的石榴裙下和高跟鞋前的青年不知多少，她也很願意和他們去敷衍，能度似乎很誠懇，使每一個進攻的青年，都得到相當的滿足。但很奇怪的是：任何人都不能獲得最後的勝利，這些青年都是初出茅蘆的小後生，還没有社會上的地位和百萬的家財，一個物質享受慾極濃厚的李小姐，自然不願和這些窮光蛋去做永久的伴侣的，有一次在一個知心的女友前，很坦白地說：「這些人都是賴蝦蟆想喫天鵝肉啊，誰願意嫁給這些窮措大受苦呢？我願意嫁一個富翁去做小老婆，但决不願意嫁給這些窮措大做妻的。</p>
<p>誰能在事實上否認李小姐不是一個候補姨太太呢？</p>

<p>— 張老三</p>
<p>（九）多末儍的念頭</p>
<p>在凉台上站了一會，還思忖着這問題，不留意的當兒，一枝僅吸了二口的紙烟從我的手指間滑出。望望隔壁的房裏也没有熄燈，玲瓏的窗帘上，印着敏姊的影子，似乎觀看什麽雜誌之類。我從地上拾了一粒沙子向窗上投去，窗帘的影子漸漸放大，一陣瑣動之後，她探出頭來，</p>
<p>「睡不熟？到這邊來坐坐。」</p>
<p>投沙子是無聊的舉動，旣在無聊的時候，自已毫不思索地走過去了。敏姊穿着睡衣，露了脚踝，坐在沙發裏，一本書還平放在側裏的小茶几上。我走近一看，是本日記，隱約間好像有我的名字。她拍着沙發的另一端「坐吧，别亂瞧！」她說着站起身把睡衣緊了緊，我知道她誤會了。</p>
<p>「那是本什麽書？」</p>
<p>像解釋似的問。</p>
<p>「日記。好久不寫了」</p>
<p>她從小茶几上抽出兩枝烟，授給我一枝，燃了火，相對的一笑，已無話可說。我左腿架上右腿，努力抽着烟，經騐告訴我，在這樣的塲合，不能長時間的沉默。敏姊隨手掩上她的日記後，也没有一句開端的對話。於是我想隨便的亂說，但是每一句話都梗住在喉頭；譬如說「没有睡啊？」明明是坐在沙發上，正如踏進影戲院遇見朋友問「看影戲」？同樣的滑稽；「明天進幼稚園去？」又是她自已說過的話。甬道中送來了高跟鞋的聲音，上海之夜正從這時候開始，我呆呆的望着天花板，敏姊也默䭾的蕩洩着赤了的脚踝。</p>
<p>「戀愛的時候，或者有這樣的情形」，我的心馳上青春的軌道，妄想起從小說上看來的一幕，「爲什麽沉默着不說話呢？」自已問着自已，無意的笑了起來。</p>
<p>「笑什麽？」</p>
<p>她以爲我發現了她本身可以發笑的地方，受驚的問。我忖着微笑。</p>
<p>「一個多末儍的念頭！」</p>
<p>（十）永遠瞧不起種田的農夫</p>
<p>起來已日影滿窗，茶房授給我一張日歷反面鉛筆草寫着的便條：</p>
<p>「晨起，弟甜夢方濃，未敢驚擾，先行矣。前途着落後，請來書告我。敏」兒父是資本家，他永遠瞧不起我們種田的農夫；聽說母親出嫁的時候，舅父堅决反對。外祖母因爲母親懦弱賢淑，終於嫁給鄕下人的父親，現在母親死了，外祖母死了，正如敏姊的話，我們的關係隨着兩位老人家的死亡而敗産。我不願冒極大的危險丨恥辱丨去見舅父；雖然舅父近來的情形，報上常登載他研究佛學的消息，研究佛學是否懺悔從前的刻薄待人還是個疑問。舅父祗生一個女兒，四五房姨太太也一無所出，白了頭髮，没有一個兒子承歡膝下是他的缺憾；研究佛學想靠「天」賜給他一個寗馨兒，所謂「人之將死，其言也善」。佛經如其眞是神聖的東西，你像「自由」一樣，天下諸多罪惡，假汝以行。敏姊對於「前途」抱着十二分的希望，大概也爲了這個緣故吧？</p>
<p>我愁思了半天，似乎爲了敏姊的熱望，也應該到舅父家裏去一次，他永遠瞧不起種田的農夫不是我的恥辱。</p>
<p>午後，踏上徐家匯電車，佔了車廂一角，展開今天的報紙，本埠新聞欄觸目的一條「慈善家徐炳南發起講經大會」，小標題「今日在方外别墅舉行「，我何不幸，躬逢斯會！</p>
<p>徐炳南是我的舅父，去年新建築了方外别墅之後，更騙來一個慈善家的頭銜。慈善家發起的講經大會，當然有擁護之必要；以結善緣！何怪我等了幾輛徐家匯電車，都是蓋冠往來，摩士如雲，别問慈善家發起講經大會有何價值，這許多摩登人物又怎樣與講經大會發生重大的興趣呢？</p>

<h3 id="c280">影評的基準 <a href="#c280" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e280" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">280</a></h3>
<p>— 李馥</p>
<p>近來因爲電影界的客觀情勢和一般人對於過去影評公式化的反撥，一時提倡建設的影評和專談技巧之風，甚囂塵上。的確，中國的電影批評，現在確已走到了一個非常嚴重的時機，這時候龍夠好好的振作，不入歧途，那麽當然是中國電影文化前途之福，萬一不看清這種迫在目前的危機，在再出發的第一步走錯了路，那也許會將整個影評送上破滅的道路去的。</p>
<p>提倡建設的影評，和影評者應該更豐富地再敎育自已，這當然是目前最切要的工作，但是在這些口號之下，我們千萬莫要幻想，以爲過去我們在意識上的批評，已經獲得了已可告一段落的成功。祇因爲過去的影評没有走上正路，有時候姑容，有時候偏激，最大部分的是用公式來簡單地一套，所以影評纔會失掉觀衆和從業者的信用。自有電影批評以來以至今日，「電影不單是娱樂的東西！而該有些社會的意羲」，這一步基礎的工作，還不曾完全地做到，所以，所謂建設的批評，我們决不能簡單地解釋作專對電影作一些技術上的匡正和指導，我們還要很快地確立批評的原則，和加强一切影片的意識的檢討。</p>
<p>我以爲過去影評的最大的缺點，是在没有一定的標凖。對於我們在一種畸形發展之下産生出來的中國影片，用過於奢望的的尺度來批評，這固然是一種錯誤；反之，用啓迪大衆智識，提高文化水凖……等等原則來向金元帝國的影片商人要求，也未始不是一椿滑稽。我們在批評一張影片之先，一定要先認明這張影片是在如何的條件之下生産出來的。譬如說，「鐵蹄紅滬」，這一張影片是一九三一年的蘇聯的蘇維基諾的出品，所以我們有權利可以嚴厲地批評他對於戀愛問題，對於經濟制度等等的分析的模糊。因爲，這是「一九三一年」的「蘇聯」的作品。再譬如說，昨天在國泰開映的「四十二號街」。這無疑的是一張用風流肉感來號召的美國式的影片。但是，當我們更進一步地檢討一下的時候，我們可以發現，這片子和其他的歌舞片有些不同，這兒不單是歌舞，不單是愛慾紛糾，他描寫了歌無團的裏面，描寫了所謂明星的内容，暴露了歡樂背後的悲哀。在這兒，我們就不能不將這些進步的特徵和從前的那些作品分别出來，而給以公正的批評。再舉個例，譬如在德國那企司的鐵拳政治之下，一切的藝術家失掉了自由。於是，對於在那種環境之下産生出來的作品，甚至對於藝術至上主義的「夢裏香唇」，我們也要對於這些製作者們不爲强暴所屈的對藝術的良心的態度，表示若干的好感。</p>
<p>我們需要的是正確的批評標凖，要把握這種標凖，影評家應該努力地去認識現在的世界和社會。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3 id="c281">「香草美人」觀感 <a href="#c281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— 寅仲</p>
<p>「香草美人」的内容意義，叙寫着我國實業工廠因受外國的經濟侵略而破産，以致一般靠着血汗勞力爲生活的工人遭遇到失業的慘狀，尤其是一個「小家碧玉」式的女工匹生活的壓迫，不得已而賣自已。</p>
<p>這樣一個故事的内容，實在可說是現實社會的寫眞。至少它這個劇本的結構，也要比以前同類的片子進步些。而這個片子的表現方式是用的「回憶式」，這倒也是一種新頴的方法；記得「春潮」裏也有這種方法的，但没有像這兒的「具體化」。這也許能給予觀衆以新的印象。但有一部份的觀衆。却未免感到沉悶，如一個因失業而犯罪的木匠在法庭上一幕又一幕的向法官歷歷供述，似乎過於冗長，過於累贅。但鏡頭角度的配置，却是精確的，旋轉也很靈敏而活潑</p>
<p>說起演出，我們不能不承認那飾工人王阿大和他的兄弟的演員確是非常成功的。阿大之胆怯神情，和他兄弟之崛强氣概，各有不同之個性，一强一怯，眞可說是「相映成趣」。</p>
<p>總之，這片子比以前所有國片的成績，已經可觀多了。</p>
<h3 id="c282">評「香草美人」 <a href="#c282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— 敷禮</p>
<p>這部「香草美人」的演出，揭露着經濟侵略的可怕，無形中一個工廠因受不住它的壓迫，而倒閉，致使大批的工人失了業，影響到社會的不安，多量的産生出許多悲慘墮落的罪惡。</p>
<p>關於這種題材的取用，只要正確而嚴密的去處理它，未始不可成爲一部很深刻而爲觀衆所同情的作品。但作者在演出方面，把整個的故事，片斷的用回憶來寫出，不免使觀衆不能連串地看到緊張的表演，還有每一幕的變動，都用總說明的字幕，也覺得太多而太刻板了。</p>
<p>一幕櫉窗裏陳列的外國香烟，拿「卡通」畫來反映出金錢外漏，倒是很有意思的。</p>
<p>飾王阿大的謝雲卿，很能盡職劇中人的身份，面部的表情，也很入微，雖然他還是改變作風的第一次。夏佩珍，同王徵的表情也還自然，都使人感到滿意。</p>
<h3 id="c283">演員的選擇及其化妝　談談富翁與工頭 <a href="#c283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— 嚴肅</p>
<p>導演者存接到一部劇本要開拍的時候，對於應該選擇怎樣的演員才合劇中人的身份性格，這是第一個要義。其次還有要那演員怎樣的化妝才能適合劇中人亦是應該十分注意的。這是最淺薄的常識，誰都不能否認的。可是咱們中國影片，不知怎樣常當呌與劇中人身份不合的演員去表演。這或者一則他們公司裏頭所有的演員中只有那一位演員可將就合格。其次就是側重明星中心主義。只要他或她是一位已經成名的明星，就可以號召而賣錢。而對於藝術的眞實性，就可以不管。國産影片中凡是富翁地主之流多是面團團的角色，大概是只知道凡是富翁地主之流，一定是面團團的吧。其次，國産影片中凡是工頭等輩，多是狀貌兇惡滿臉横肉的，這大概是只知道做到工頭等輩一定要兇惡的吧。就富翁這一角色來說，不久以前我們在「金山」裏頭所看見的富翁廠主以及「四十二號街」裏頭的富翁歌舞班主，都是怎樣的成功的「金山」裏頭的富翁廠主，表演出一種衰弱的身體，慘白的容貌，象徵着資産階級在富的努力中的精疲力竭的樣子，可是同時又是表演出他的作威作福尊嚴無比的神態來。「四十二號街」裏頭的富翁歌舞班主，丨爲了一個歌女而出資贊助歌舞班的班主丨表演出一種「金牛」的儍相，但也有他的尊嚴。再說工頭，在「金山」裏頭的工頭，表演出一種奸險狡猾，謟媚卑鄙給人一種心惡的深刻印象，比較表面的兇惡的淺薄感覺眞是天壞之别也。</p>

<p>毛國的電影事業，近來正在狂奔直上，而就現在的情狀看來，本年度顯然已有成功的徵象了。自八月一日起，各影片公司，關於出品方面，租片方面，都有滿意的結果。出品方面，信用已日見增加而且另外有電影業信用借欵的銀行，也創設了。影片的爲各戲院所租映的，也紀錄日高，這種情狀，一方雖因從事電影業者努力所致，一方却因德國的經濟狀况，近來已有轉機的緣故。各影片公司的製片計畫，據說直至現在，所有的出品，已足够未來的一季丨冬季丨中國映的。自七月至九月，電影檢查會所通過的影片，一共是六十六張，可是一九三一年同一時期，祗有五十四張，而一九三一年同時期是六十一張。出口的德國影片，一九三三年一月至八月，八個月的中間，一共有一五·九○○·○○○米突·但一九三十二年同期的八個月中·却有一七，九○○，○○○米突。德國的影片，運到海外各國的，其中操德語的邦國，占總數百分之四十二。就上文所述，我們也不難知道德國的電影業正在很神速的發展呢。</p>
<h3 id="c285">禁苑春濃的劇本　  馨甫　與福斯出品「閬苑琴心」相同　珍妮蓋諾掉換了麗琳哈蕙 <a href="#c285" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e285" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">285</a></h3>
<p>大約是在七月裡吧？本刊曾經登過一篇電影小說，原名是Ａdorable，譯名是一間苑琴心一，福斯公司出品，珍妮蓋諾主演，起初我很奇怪，爲什麽這個片子，到現在還没有運到中國來開映，現在却明白了。</p>
<p>原來福斯公司攝製這個片子的劇本，是向德國烏發公司購來的，去年盛傳烏發和福斯合作，這也是一個原因，不過福斯所有的版權，僅限於美國；所以「間苑琴心」一片，祇好在美國開映，而烏發公司，同時却用了這個劇本，拍成了一都影片呌ＨerHighnessCommands，譯名是「禁苑春濃」，内容一切，都和「間苑琴心」相同；不過片名換了一個，演員變了一下。麗琳哈蕙在這部片子裡，以一位金枝玉葉的公主，同時喬裝一位嬌小玲瓏的侍女，能够把兩個不同人物的身份，做得十分相像，確是不易，這一個非常幽默的宫闌羅曼斯，無疑的，又是一部新形式的歌舞片子了。左面就是「禁苑春濃一中的一幕。</p>

<p>— 謝月笙</p>
<p>雪芳和蘇容倆正在談着閒話，忽見紅玉天雄進來，她連忙起來招待，順便給紅玉天雄介紹。紅玉因見蘇容才貌出衆，而且舉止風流，她的芳心裏早已向他表示無限的熱意。</p>
<p>成蔭的柳樹下，坐着一對青年的情侣，綠油油的碧波裏，倒映着他倆的倩影。雪芳偎在蘇容的懷裏，互相陶醉在深淵的愛河裏。</p>
<p>突然地蘇容犯了某種政治的嫌疑，一五警十，把蘇容拖到警察局去了。這一來把雪芳驚嚇得魂飛九霄，她急忙地去請求天雄，替蘇容搭救出獄。灰色籠罩了大地的晚上，程天雄探到一個靜寂的秘窟出的這個使人驚訝的ＸＸ疑案，却在這裏發現了。他聽見裏面是曹懷仁同餘黨在設法陷害蘇容著隂謀。他迅速地去偵緝隊報告，但機警的曹懷仁已在他們羽黨逮捕之前漏網了。梅雪芳爲感激天雄救出了蘇容，特地舉行了一個同樂會以表慶祝。</p>
<p>時間一天一天的過去，蘇梅倆的感情却一天一天的增高。在富有財勢的曹懷仁，當然不能使他心平氣服。他事前在鄕間造了一所密室，等候着雪芳和蘇容出來游玩，刦來幽禁在機關裏，以報前次失敗之仇。</p>
<p>梅母因雪芳蘇容同時失蹤，惶然地請了天雄來家商議。天雄很了解道件疑案的原由，憑着他神秘的手腕，探得了曹懷仁的機關。他一面安慰梅母，一面請了父妹同去營救蘇梅。一你不是喜歡姓蘇的嗎？曹懷仁用着畏迫的手段向雪芳說。他喝着黨徒鞭韃着蘇容，從他可怖的面具上，浮起一層隂險的矜美來。這不由雪芳不驚訝得狂喊出來。接着乒乓一陣槍聲和嘈雜聲，把曹懷仁打倒在地上了。天雄紅玉同着他父親程大鵬把蘇容雪芳救出來了。</p>
<p>雪芳感激着天雄的營救，欽佩他的勇敢，重燃起了愛的火弦來。一程先生，承你幾次地搭救我，使我感激得將來怎樣地報答你纔好呢」。她很羞澀地，向着天雄含笑慢慢地把頭低了下去。「不，雪芳：我不要你感謝，我覺着我要……一天雄自知這話大唐突了，他全身的血液緊漲得似乎要崩潰了，「雪芳我愛……」這一句含有硫磺性的話彈，終於在天雄的火般的情感裏爆發了。（未完）</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Fujian provincial rebellion, led by Chen Youren, has established a stance of breaking away from the central government, arbitrarily establishing foreign policies and brewing plans to borrow money from Japan. The government authorities regard the Fujian provincial matter as an internal political issue of our country. Foreigners should quietly observe the central government's measures and allow it to self-destruct. All actions of the fake foreign affairs department naturally cannot obtain a legal basis. During this period, if any negotiations or loan agreements occur with foreigners, the central government will absolutely and strictly deny them. If necessary, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue a statement explaining the intention. (27th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Nanchang) Yang Dezhao met with Chairman Chiang today to report on Guangdong's arrangements regarding Fujian, discuss the acceptance and assistance of those opposing the rebellion, and urge central committee members such as Hu Hanmin to come to the capital.

However, the personnel have not yet been decided. Miao Peicheng said that the central government has decided to send special commissioners south.

Chairman Zhou Bomin reported on the significance of holding the enlarged memorial week, stating that at this time of strong neighbors pressing in and serious national crisis, Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others dared to betray the party and harm the country, organizing a reactionary government in Fujian and accommodating the Communist Party to undermine the bandit suppression work. He requested that the Central Government issue a clear order to suppress them in order to curb the chaos and protect the party and save the country. Ye Chucang then delivered a speech, saying that the Fujian Incident was caused by a group of rebellious elements with ulterior motives, intending to fulfill their own selfish desires, and did not represent the entire Fujian province. Moreover, the members of the pseudo-government organization are extremely complex, and the organization's absurdity is particularly unreasonable. Based on past examples, all illegal organizations will inevitably come to an end. Therefore, the Fujian rebellion is not worth worrying about. Given a little time, it will perish without our attack. Huang Jie delivered a speech, first describing the anti-Japanese battle at Nantianmen, and then briefly expressing his feelings about the Fujian Incident. As a soldier, he only knows how to seek the welfare of the country and the survival of the nation, and to support the government that resists Japan and suppresses bandits. If ordered, he will surely go forward with his spear to eliminate harm for the country, regardless of any sacrifice. He hopes that all compatriots in the country will also adopt this attitude and support the central government. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>"In order to maintain a glorious history and avoid shameful sacrifices, the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army should make plans as early as possible and strive to extricate themselves."</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Propaganda Committee recently issued an open letter to the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army. The original text is quoted as follows: "Since Chen Mingshu, Li Jishen, and others, under the guise of the 19th Route Army, initiated a rebellion in Fujian, there have been rumors at home and abroad that Chen, Li, and others' rebellious actions are actually secretly supported by the 19th Route Army. The people of the country are familiar with the past history of the 19th Route Army and deeply believe in its loyalty to the party and the country. However, if you allow the rebels to take you hostage and do not try to clarify your position, then the suspicions of the masses will not be entirely unwarranted. Therefore, we sincerely address all the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army: The state raises troops to defend the country and protect the people. The military creed lies in observing discipline and following the law. This has been consistent throughout history and across the world. Moreover, the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army are soldiers of the National Revolutionary Army, deeply influenced by the Three Principles of the People and have a long history with the party. You should hold fast and unswervingly. Therefore, since the Eastern Expedition, the Northern Expedition, the suppression of bandits, and the resistance against Japan, all the officers and soldiers have followed orders, fought tirelessly, risked their lives in danger, and achieved success wherever they went. The annihilation of bandits in southern Jiangxi and the fierce battle in Shanghai have won the praise of the people of the country and the admiration of people around the world. All these glorious and brilliant histories, the reputation of loyalty, bravery, and struggle, are what all our officers and soldiers should cherish, maintain, and carry forward. Now, Chen, Li, and other rebels, under the guise of the 19th Route Army, have colluded with reactionary elements from the Social Democratic Party, the Third Party, the Communist Party, and the Nationalist Party, all with their own backgrounds, privately established a name, united with the Communists and attached themselves to the enemy, betraying the party and the country, welcoming bandit leaders, representatives in Fuzhou, and supplying the remnants of bandits with military equipment and grain, endangering the party and the country, and hastening their own demise, reaching this extreme of madness. Chen, Li, and other rebels are prone to chaos and cannot be deeply blamed. It is a pity that the officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army have been taken hostage, willingly driven, and obeyed by the rebels, associating themselves with bandits and suffering sacrifices, which is regrettable. I still remember when the officers and soldiers entered Fujian to suppress bandits, they declared that they would be committed to resisting Japan and suppressing bandits, and would not participate in any civil wars. How long ago was it that those words were still ringing in our ears, but the so-called commitment to suppressing bandits is now uniting with the Communist bandits and becoming their tools. The so-called non-participation in civil war is now becoming the prime culprit of civil war. Officers and soldiers, please think about it, how will you explain yourselves, and how will you face the people of the country? Moreover, what Chen, Li, and other rebels use to deceive our officers and soldiers and appeal to the people of the country is resistance against Japan. Resistance against Japan and saving the country, restoring lost territories and wiping out shame, are the responsibilities of all citizens and the goals of the government's efforts. If not a national traitor or a Han traitor, who would dare to disagree or dissent? However, to resist Japan and betray the party and the country, to resist Japan and unite with the Communist bandits, this is what the people of the country strongly denounce, and the intentions of Chen and Li can be known. Proven by the fact that Chen Youren, Han Binli, and other pro-Japanese traitors have gathered under the banner of rebellion, either presiding over government diplomacy or crossing the sea to collude with Japanese factions, it is known that those who claim to resist Japan are actually uniting with and attaching themselves to Japan. During the Battle of Shanghai, our officers and soldiers fought bloody battles for three weeks and did not fail to defend the people of the country, winning the reputation of national heroes. If you were to stoop to follow the rebels, turn your face against the enemy, and use the vanguard of resisting Japan and saving the country as the pioneer of surrendering to the enemy, then for thousands of years, what kind of people will the officers and soldiers be considered? Even if the officers and soldiers do not love themselves, if the anti-Japanese martyrs in the nine heavens know, how can they not be heartbroken and cry bitterly? Furthermore, Chen, Li, and other rebels are destroying the party and harming the country, uniting with bandits and attaching themselves to the enemy, reversing their course, and are destined to fail. Therefore, as soon as the banner of rebellion is raised, the calls for condemnation are flying everywhere. Pointed at by thousands of people, it will end without disease. Even with the dependence of the 19th Route Army, it is difficult to escape the sanctions of the people of the whole country. The ringleaders and prime culprits can flee to other places, laughing and cursing as they please, but the officers and soldiers of our 19th Route Army have not only suffered real disaster, but also been shamed and污名,親厚痛心,仇讐快意,亲朋痛心,仇人快意。 This is not what the people of the country expect from the officers and soldiers, nor is it the way for the officers and soldiers to seek their own welfare. In order to maintain a glorious history and avoid shameful sacrifices, you should make plans as early as possible and strive to extricate yourselves. The judgment of obedience and rebellion, success and failure are clearly distinguished. The opportunity of confusion and awakening is related to fortune and misfortune. Officers and soldiers of the 19th Route Army, if you can repent and resolutely stand out, you are fortunate to do so, and there is great hope." (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e32">Current Affairs Commentary: Reflections on the Financial Panic in Xuzhou <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>Since the outbreak of the financial crisis in Xuzhou, two weeks have passed in an instant. Although there are signs of gradual recovery at present, it is expected that the vitality of society will be severely damaged after this catastrophe.</p>
<p>The occurrence of this crisis is actually due to the continuous natural disasters and successive man-made disasters in recent years, which have led to the desolation and decline of commerce and markets in the interior. The financial turnover has long felt inflexible. Recently, the Southern goods industry in Xuzhou has been collectively bankrupted due to the strict demands for repayment of debts in Shanghai. As a result, things have gone from bad to worse. The previously inflexible finance has become even more difficult to manage. Moreover, the finance industry's internals feel even more empty. Therefore, the run on private banknotes issued by seven private banks, including Gongyu Bank, has begun and cannot be stopped.</p>
<p>According to reports, the private banknotes issued by seven banks, including Gongyu Bank, total about 2.08 million strings. At a rate of five strings per yuan, it should be about 420,000 yuan. However, the total assets and accounts of the above seven banks are only more than 300,000 yuan. Even with collateral, it must be discounted. In fact, the actual value is probably less than 300,000 yuan, which is more than 100,000 yuan less than the amount of banknotes issued. Most of the recipients of this kind of empty money are general farmers and the petty bourgeoisie. They usually earn a small income from hard work to maintain the livelihoods of several family members. Once panic strikes and a run occurs, large shops refuse to use them first, and small shops imitate them afterward. The market circulation is suddenly obstructed, and the physical and mental suffering of the general public in the surging tide in Xuzhou over the past two weeks is self-evident.</p>
<p>The issuance of private banknotes in various parts of our country was originally intended to facilitate merchants and had a solid reserve. Therefore, the market circulated well and had strong credit. Later, businessmen who only sought self-interest believed that banknotes had a strong credit in the market, so they regarded banknotes as a huge source of profit and issued them one after another. The amount of banknotes issued was not limited, and the cash reserve was insufficient. In the beginning, it was temporarily maintained by the credit of the old banknotes. However, once the flaw was revealed, it would lead to a huge disaster. For more than ten years, those with positions have repeatedly called for and thought of ways to rectify it. However, in fact, officials and merchants often collude with each other to maintain the issuance as much as possible. Therefore, for more than ten years, it has been known that this kind of private banknote will eventually cause a huge change. However, due to factual environment restrictions, the issuance of banknotes is like a free ride. The Xuzhou banknotes, for example, have had several financial reorganization committees. However, they still cannot eliminate this long-standing problem. It can be seen that the current crisis in Xuzhou is not an accidental and sudden phenomenon.</p>
<p>Recently, the Xuzhou crisis has gradually come to an end. However, there are probably still a considerable number of residual banknotes on the market. The enterprising and promising Xuzhou administrative authorities are now going to take advantage of this great opportunity to order the total elimination of this soil of inferior exploitation to prevent it from remaining in the world and maintain the interests of the majority of poor people. Then, the outbreak of today's crisis can become a very meaningful history. Moreover, the year-end settlement is approaching, and the market finance will be more tense. Who knows whether the banks currently experiencing runs will re-emerge and make a comeback to continue to maintain their old rights. At this time, the administrative authorities must adhere to their attitude and strictly prevent them from issuing again. Otherwise, the mistakes of the past may be repeated.</p>
<p>Finally, the author also has a word for the local authorities. The current abundance of private banknotes in the market is not unique to Xuzhou. There are private banknotes everywhere, north and south of the Yangtze River. In areas where panic has not yet occurred, there must be some precautions. At least within the possible scope, the issuance should be cautious, and the reserves should be sufficient. Preparedness averts peril, so that the same crisis in Xuzhou will not be seen in other places.</p>
<h3 id="e33">Speaking of the Fujian Incident and National Salvation, President Wang Reported at the Executive Yuan Memorial Week Yesterday <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) President Wang reported on the memorial week at the Executive Yuan on the 27th, saying that the biggest event this week was the rebellion of Chen Mingshu and others in Fujian. Since the founding of the Republic of China, although many political disputes have occurred, there have only been a few rebellions that changed the national flag. Yuan Shikai's Hongxian in the fifth year of the Republic of China was eliminated in eighty days, and Zhang Xun's restoration in the sixth year of the Republic of China was eliminated in more than ten days. Since then, no one dared to try rebellions that changed the national flag because they would never succeed. However, after the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, the Communist Party established the Chinese Soviet in the bandit areas, changing the foundation of the Republic of China. In the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the puppet established the puppet Manchukuo in the three northeastern provinces, alienating itself from the Republic of China. In the twenty-second year of the Republic of China, there have only been these four rebellions that changed the form of government. Because changing the form of government is to be an enemy of the people of the whole country, no one dares to try it lightly. Unexpectedly, Chen Mingshu and others actually did this, which is extremely heartbreaking. On November 22, Mingshu and others issued a declaration as members of the so-called People's Revolutionary Government, using the term "Year One of the Chinese Republic." There is no difference in meaning between "Republic of China" and "Republic" on the surface. The reason why they changed the Republic of China to the Republic can only be understood by looking at the content of their declaration. It turns out that their declaration cancels the fundamental provisions of equality for all citizens of the Republic of China and encourages a part of the people to arbitrarily rob and kill other parts of the people. Their change of the foundation of the Republic of China is no different from the organization of the bandit areas, and their alienation from the Republic of China is no different from the organization of the puppet regime. This is the fifth rebellion to change the form of government. Moreover, the term "Year One" lightly wipes out the history of the twenty-two years of the Republic of China. The history of the pioneers who created and supported the Republic of China, the Chinese Kuomintang, which took the construction of the Republic of China as its responsibility and struggled arduously, and the Three Principles of the People, which built the Republic of China, have also been wiped out. This is not only an irreconcilable hatred for comrades of the Kuomintang standing on the party's position, but also an irreconcilable hatred for the people standing on the position of the Republic of China. Some people say that this rebellion may disrupt the central government's policy direction. I dare to say responsibly that the central government's policy direction will never be disrupted, and it cannot be disrupted. On July 28, I jointly issued a telegram with Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, saying that the methods to save the nation and survive are (treating the symptoms is no more urgent than suppressing the Communist bandits, and treating the root cause is no more urgent than production and construction, so as to develop the people's strength and enrich the national strength). Until now, we believe that there is no other way to save the nation and survive. Speaking of suppressing the bandits, the Communist Party's actions in the bandit areas are not only something that the Communist parties in Europe, America, and Japan would not do, but even the Soviet Russian Communist Party would probably not do. They directly inherited the actions of Li Zicheng and Zhang Xianzhong. The reason why they have come to this point is the result of their own creation and the result of their intensification. Because the economic situation in China is most clearly understood in the Principle of People's Livelihood, to achieve the completion of the Principle of People's Livelihood, peaceful means must be used, and violent means cannot be used. Therefore, although the Premier advocated revolutionary means for politics, he advocated peaceful improvement for economics. The Communist Party did not understand China's social and economic situation, and thus used the theory of class struggle to create the fact of social melee, forcibly dividing the people of society into classes, taking murder and arson as a code, and opening the door to shooting and killing. In the beginning, they robbed and killed people, and in the end, they would rob and kill themselves. These are all actual situations in the bandit areas. The sixth meeting report of the Rural Reconstruction Committee has a detailed investigation report. There were more than 26 million people in the Gan region, but now there are less than 20 million left. The number of deaths is unprecedented in decades. Today, there are so-called "mass graves" in the bandit areas, where men, women, the strong, and the weak die together, and the situation is more tragic than that of birds and animals. The disaster in the bandit areas is really unbearable to think about. Therefore, suppressing the bandits is the most important of all work today, and it is also the prerequisite for all work. If the Communist bandits are not eliminated, then everything else cannot be started. Clearing the Communist bandits requires military measures as a temporary solution, and political and economic efforts in production and construction as a fundamental solution. The bandit disaster is so tragic, yet some people want to turn Fujian into a bandit area and turn the whole country into a bandit area. This is not just the demise of the country, but the extermination of the race, and there is nothing more painful than this. Recently, there have been rumors that the military suppression of the bandits has been unsuccessful. I have telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek to inquire about it. I received a reply saying that since the military suppression of the bandits began last month, the first battle of Xiaoshi Zixi Town, the second battle of Huwan, the third battle of Tengtian, the fourth battle of Daxiongguan, and the fifth battle of Shengang Dangkou were all major victories for our army. The first, third, fifth, and seventh legions of the bandit army have all been in contact one after another and suffered many casualties. The three battles of Huwan, Daxiongguan, and Shengangkou captured even more prisoners. According to the personal confession of Le Nuzhang, the deputy division commander of the sixth division of the captured bandits, after this great setback, the bandit army has suffered a loss of more than one-third. Because our army has adopted the bunker policy, it is truly "solid fortifications and hard battles." We can fight when advancing and defend when retreating. The hope of recovering the bandit areas is getting closer and closer. We must first recognize the necessity of suppressing the Communists, and second, we must recognize the possibility of suppressing the Communists. All the rumors are rumors fabricated by the bandits and are absolutely unreliable. We can only intensify the work of suppressing the bandits, and we must never allow the Jiangxi Communist bandits to linger on, and we must never allow Fujian to become a bandit area like Jiangxi, and even more so we must not allow the whole country to become a bandit area. This is the responsibility we bear to the country and the nation, and we must never relax. The major plans for treating the symptoms by suppressing the bandits and treating the root cause by construction have been determined, and the diplomatic policy has also been established accordingly. Some people think that the diplomatic policy is weak and is used as an excuse by those who oppose the central government. I think that the diplomatic policy must recognize oneself, recognize the environment, and then make a decision. After the decision is made, it must not be easily shaken, so as to plunge the country into danger. After the September 18th Incident, I criticized the authorities in North China for non-resistance, and some people thought it was too tough. In late May, I was responsible for the ceasefire agreement in North China, and some people thought it was too weak. These are not true. After the September 18th Incident, the authorities in North China consistently held the principle of non-resistance, so I opposed them. After the loss of Rehe, the North China army fought hard at various passes of the Great Wall for three months, and when their strength was exhausted and there were no reinforcements, they retreated. The loss of Beiping and Tianjin was imminent, so I was responsible for the ceasefire. Today, I am responsible for the ceasefire in Shanghai and oppose the ceasefire in North China. This is tantamount to hoping that the government will be responsible for the ceasefire when one's own army is defeated, and hoping that the government will drive the defeated army of others to their death. I do not recognize the claim that advocating resistance is tough and advocating ceasefire is weak. If the diplomatic policy is shaken because of fear of excuses from opponents, the result will only be the demise of the country. In the Chongzhen era of the late Ming Dynasty, there was Manchukuo outside the Pass and bandits inside, so it was impossible to take care of both. Yuan Chonghuan, who was in charge of the war and defense matters outside the Pass at that time, said, "Defense is the right strategy, attack is the unusual strategy, and peace is the side strategy," and also said, "It is gradual, not sudden, and it is real, not false." He negotiated peace with Manchukuo, one to arrange the war and defense outside the Pass, and the other to quickly sweep away the bandits with all his strength. However, at that time, the scholar-officials did not consider how the emerging forces of Manchukuo were, how the trend of the bandits was, and how much strength they had to deal with them. They only advocated war in high tones, saying that those who advocated defense against Manchukuo were cowardly, and those who advocated peace were traitors. Yuan Chonghuan could only be heartbroken and unable to speak. Chongzhen was hijacked by public opinion, hesitant and at a loss. Yuan Chonghuan was eventually executed for advocating peace without authorization, and the Ming Dynasty also perished. The demise of the Ming Dynasty was not so much due to Manchukuo and the bandits as it was due to the false and pretentious mentality of the scholar-officials. The situation is even more different now. In the past fifty or sixty years, our country has fallen behind in politics, economy, military, and culture due to various reasons. Assessing one's own strength is not the same as Manchukuo and China at that time. I say this not to retreat blindly. When necessary, we must sacrifice for the sake of national personality even if we do not assess our strength. But if there is a glimmer of hope for us to do the work of saving the nation and surviving, then we must do our best to find it. The ancients said, "Seeking help from others is not as good as seeking help from oneself." I would like to add another sentence, "Blaming others is not as good as blaming oneself." Now we can only severely criticize ourselves and urge ourselves on. Why have politics, economy, military, and culture all fallen behind? Why can't we compete with others? If the country has not perished for a day, then we must work hard for a day. Today's international world is that one can only exist with strength. One can only be friends with others if one can be enemies with others, and one can only be enemies with others if one can be friends with others. Then, if there is a glimmer of hope to do one's best in the work of treating the symptoms by suppressing the bandits and treating the root cause by production and construction, it is of course within the scope of domestic affairs, but is it not also within the scope of diplomacy? Compared with the false and pretentious mentality and wishful thinking, it is always more useful. Then why be afraid of excuses from opponents and easily shake the policy direction of saving the nation and surviving? In other words, for the sake of the country, one's personal life and reputation are not worth anything. Let the opponents make excuses. The above is an elaboration from the Fujian Incident to the issue of saving the nation and surviving. I will work hard, and I hope my comrades will work hard together.

<p>(Harbin) The international train that departed from Harbin on the 26th derailed and overturned suddenly between Lama Dianzi and Xiao Songzi on the western section of the line. The train accident on the Chinese Eastern Railway is the most recent incident. The reason for this is the conspiracy plan of the Anti-Manchu Army, that is, a dozen soldiers of the Anti-Manchu Army opened fire and attacked when they saw the train overturn. The soldiers of the Air Force Squadron in the train fought back. Two Japanese soldiers were killed and one was injured. The casualties of other passengers and attendants are unknown. (Japanese United News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Yesterday at 3 PM, the international train from Harbin to Manzhouli was traveling on the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway between Xiao Haozi and Lama Dianzi Station, when the track was destroyed by bandits, and the train derailed and overturned. Commander Takabo, the chief of the Public Security Bureau's police affairs section, Kotaro Takamizu, and five or six executives from the Manchukuo Telegraph and Telephone Company, as well as more than 30 Japanese soldiers, were all on the train. Their whereabouts are unknown, and their safety is a concern. It is reported that when the international train overturned, five or six members of the Air Force Squadron on the train immediately came out to fight. Two people were killed in battle and two were seriously injured. A rescue train has been sent from Harbin to the scene. (Dentsu telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Commander Takabo, who was involved in the train derailment between Xiao Haozi and Lama Dianzi on the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway, was escorted to Qiqihar by a rescue armored train at 8 AM today. Of the 50 Japanese passengers who suffered losses due to the derailment, only nine were injured and none were killed. (Dentsu telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) The Siberian Express, carrying 600 passengers, was traveling at a speed of 50 miles per hour last night when it reached a point 40 miles east of Qiqihar between Lama Dianzi and Shagouzi on the western section of the Chinese Eastern Railway. Unexpectedly, the track was dismantled by bandits, causing the train to jump up and fall off the embankment. When the passengers tried to climb out of the train, the "bandits" opened fire on them. Fortunately, a detachment of Japanese soldiers was traveling on the train and fought with the bandits. After the bandits were repelled, they fled with several passengers. Two Japanese soldiers were killed and one was seriously injured. It is now believed that there must be many deaths and injuries in the wrecked train. The situation of foreign passengers in the train has not yet been heard. According to Japanese sources, there were 50 Japanese people on the train, and nine were injured. The commander of the 1st Cavalry Brigade was also on the train, but was not injured. Continued telegram: It is now known that an Englishman named Fulham, who was traveling from Kobe to London, was also one of the passengers. His life and death are unknown. According to the time of the train accident, the weather was extremely cold, and the temperature was below zero. (Reuters telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>(Shenyang) At 11 AM yesterday, 200 "bandits" appeared in Yandi, west of Taipingchuan Station on the Siping-Taonan Railway. The Taipingchuan garrison dispatched more than 100 soldiers to fight. As a result, the enemy army scattered despite suffering heavy losses, and the Japanese army also killed nine soldiers and wounded eleven. (Dentsu telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Shenyang) According to Japanese military sources, the Kwantung Army heard that the Volunteer Army was about to attack the Siping-Taonan Railway and actively dismantled the track, so it mobilized a large detachment of garrison soldiers to suppress them. At about 1 AM last night, more than 200 members of the Volunteer Army were discovered not far from Taonan, and a fierce battle began. The Volunteer Army fought bravely, killing nine Japanese soldiers and wounding dozens. When the Japanese soldiers in Taonan heard the news, they urgently sent reinforcements to the front.

<p>(Changchun) Lieutenant General Hirose Juju, commander of the 10th Division of the Japanese Army, has led his troops to encircle and suppress the Volunteer Army in the eastern border area of Jilin Province since July of this year, conducting the operation in three phases. The third phase of the operation took Dunhua and Yanji as the battlefields. The 19th Division of the Korean Army also opened the front to assist in the battle. After running around for about five months, due to the inconvenience of marching in winter, they packed up today and returned to their original defense. Lieutenant General Hirose and his staff arrived here. After five months of encirclement and suppression, they only forced the Volunteer Army to change their defense. They attacked the east and ran to the west, and attacked the south and ran to the north. Both sides suffered losses. It is reported that the Volunteer Army is also temporarily entering the mountains to wait for an opportunity, focusing on political work in winter, promoting nationalism, and publicizing the overthrow of Japanese imperialism, so as to encourage farmers to participate in the anti-Japanese work.

<p>Mr. Sugimura Yotaro, who has visited China before, traveled extensively to the north and south, spending about 80 days. He arrived in Moji on the Fusang Maru on the 27th. According to his speech to the reporters who greeted him, the land of China is fertile and rich in products. Once peace is restored, its people's strength will soon come to the Soviet Union, which can be expected. The anti-Japanese movement in China has gradually subsided, and the relationship between China and Japan is gradually improving.

He believed that reiterating the provisions of this report to China and Japan might not be beneficial. Simon also replied to another question that Simpson, the editor of the English newspaper in Harbin, had been accused by the Harbin authorities of propagating communist and anti-Manchu texts and requested to be deported.

<p>(Tokyo) Regarding the composition of the independent government of Fujian, according to the latest information received by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is said that the new government is roughly a collaboration between a certain faction and the right wing of the Communist Party, and its proclaimed political program is also quite similar to communism on the surface. It is still difficult to determine how it will develop in the future. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now decided on the attitude it should take towards the new government as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The trend of the Fujian independence movement is not yet convenient to judge hastily, and in practice, it is necessary to respect the local regime and its power.</p>
<p>(2) In order to protect its own interests, Japan feels that it is necessary to be prepared to conduct negotiations with the local regime.</p>
<p>(3) However, regardless of any regime, if there is resistance that conflicts with Japan's interests, necessary measures will be taken to deal with it in order to eliminate it. This determination is held. (Japanese United News Agency telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>[P&gt;The Audan Cabinet is Established, Almost All Cabinet Members Belong to the Radical Socialist Party, Pangol is Re-elected as Foreign Minister and the Rest Remain the Same</p>
<p>(Paris) Audan, the leader of the French Radical Socialist Party in parliament, formed a new cabinet today, serving as Prime Minister and Minister of the Interior himself. Pangol will continue to serve as Foreign Minister, Darade will continue to serve as Minister of the Army, and Pont Lei will continue to serve as Minister of Finance. The rest of the cabinet members are mostly from the Salo cabinet. (National Telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The list of the new cabinet is as follows: Prime Minister Audan concurrently serves as Minister of the Interior, Pangol serves as Minister of Foreign Affairs, Reinaudi serves as Minister of Justice, Pon Lei serves as Minister of Finance, Daradi serves as Minister of the Army, Salo serves as Minister of the Navy, Gutt serves as Minister of Aviation, Darimier serves as Minister of Colonies, Mashando serves as Minister of Budget, Termonci serves as Minister of Education, Bagano serves as Minister of Public Works, Roland Einack serves as Minister of Commerce and Industry, Ge Yi serves as Minister of Agriculture, Raimore serves as Minister of Labor, Jin Dugas serves as Minister of Pensions, Mistler serves as Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, Israel serves as Minister of Public Health, and Float serves as Minister of Merchant Marine. Except for Mashando and Reinardi, the new cabinet members are all members of the old cabinet. Mr. Lai served as a member of the Hario cabinet in 1924. (Reuters telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Taidan was ordered to form a new cabinet, he contacted his intended new cabinet members all day today. Although Hario declined the position of Prime Minister, the new cabinet may feel its great power. Although Audan decided to abolish many unimportant positions and most of the vice ministers in order to reduce government spending, many personnel from the Salo cabinet will still have positions in the new cabinet. Before Lai, the President of the Bank of France, detailed the French financial position to Audan, Audan has vaguely implied that Pon Lei will be the Minister of Finance. Daladi has agreed to do his best to assist Audan. It is expected that the list of the new cabinet will be announced tonight or tomorrow morning. Salo will resume his position as Minister of the Navy, and Pangol will continue to serve as his Minister of Foreign Affairs. (Reuters telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The candidates for the Audan cabinet are almost all members of the Radical Socialist Party. Mr. Audan originally intended to invite the New Socialist Party and the left-wing Republicans to participate in the formation of the cabinet, but because some members of the New Socialist Party were unwilling to participate directly, he decided to establish a new cabinet in accordance with the cooperation between the various Republican parties advocated by the Radical Socialist Party. In addition, former Prime Minister Helio could not participate in the formation of the cabinet because he was ill and needed rest. Now, in order to show his support for the Audan cabinet, he has agreed to serve as France's representative to the League of Nations and will also undertake other diplomatic missions when necessary. (Havas telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The new Prime Minister Audan led all the cabinet members to pay their respects to President Lebreton. After the President introduced them for an hour, Audan Mountain announced that the purpose of the new government was nothing more than (1) consolidating finances and (2) maintaining national security. He and his colleagues would immediately start working. The date of the new cabinet's first attendance in parliament has not yet been determined. (Havas telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to the "Morning Post", the new government intends to make great efforts to tighten the budget. As for the treatment of civil servants, which has been a thorny issue for previous cabinets, the new government now intends to first require a reduction of 120 million francs in government subsidies, followed by a gradual reform of internal affairs. (Havas telegram on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Audan cabinet has been established this morning, and everyone sees it as similar to the Radical Party cabinet. The important positions are all occupied by the Radical Party. Audan has worked hard to attract the New Socialist Party and the left-wing Republican Party, hoping to expand the parliamentary base of his cabinet, but he failed because the left-wing Republican Party opposed joining. For example, Bitri of the party declined the position of Minister of Finance. Former Prime Minister Tedio has begun to criticize the new cabinet and is taking an offensive against the Radical Party. It is said that the main reason for the current difficult situation is that Marxist materialism has gained influence in French politics. (National Telegram on the 27th)</p>

<p>Vienna, Today. Prime Minister Dollfuss stated in a speech that the tense situation between Germany and Austria has eased. He also denied rumors that Germany had sent a special envoy to Austria to negotiate a solution to Austro-German relations. As for the imminent cabinet reshuffle and the re-entry of farmers' party members into the cabinet, it has been confirmed that Dollfuss has already invited former Deputy Prime Minister Winkler to Vienna. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Vienna. Former Deputy Prime Minister Winkler, leader of the Farmers' Party and the Corporate Front, delivered a speech in Villach, Carinthia, commenting on Austro-German relations. He stated that the Corporate Front is prepared to establish peaceful relations with neighboring countries, especially Germany. He also said that regardless of Germany's situation, the Austrian Farmers' Party has always advocated uniting with Germany. Austria should maintain complete independence, but Austro-German relations should also be improved. The time for improving Austro-German relations is closer than most people imagine, he said. Winkler also stated, "We are not disguised National Socialists, because we oppose illusions, especially the methods used by the National Socialists. We also absolutely advocate freedom of belief. Therefore, we should not exclude ourselves from the political situation but should demonstrate our strength so that the whole country knows it." (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) The Times today carried dispatches from Berlin and Paris, stating that the French Ambassador to Berlin and the German Prime Minister, and the German Ambassador to Paris and the French Foreign Minister, had spoken twice. It is believed that this is a serious and hopeful step towards direct Franco-German discussions. People in Berlin believe that the actions of French Ambassador Ponsot are a sign that France is accommodating Germany's advocacy of direct negotiations, hoping to establish a simple and categorized convention to deal with security and arms limitation issues. People in Paris are treating this matter with caution, believing that there must be clearly defined conditions. However, the current meeting can at least be regarded as a prelude to direct talks, so it is generally considered extremely important. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) After French Ambassador Ponsot's visit to German Prime Minister Hitler a few days ago, the French newspapers have paid much attention to this matter. Many of the newspapers' commentaries have been reprinted by German newspapers. For example, the "Völkischer Beobachter" and "Deutsche Tageszeitung" in Berlin even published them on the first page in large characters to show their importance. The headlines, such as "French Public Opinion Welcomes Hitler-Ponsot Talks" and "The First Step in Direct Franco-German Negotiations," were eye-catching. Some even changed their attitude and agreed with the views of "Le Temps", not relying on Britain as an intermediary. (National News Agency, 26th)</p>
<p>Rome. The talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov are expected to focus on the issue of disarmament. Mussolini may persuade the Russian government to cooperate with Italy in using the Four-Power Pact to resolve disarmament disputes and reorganize the League of Nations so that it can include Japan, the United States, Russia, and Germany. Current affairs commentators here believe that the Russian government will support Italy's initiation of this movement. (National News Agency, 27th)</p>
<p>Belgrade, the capital of Yugoslavia. For the sake of consolidating Balkan unity, the Turkish Foreign Minister, Rushdi, arrived here today to sign a treaty of non-aggression and arbitration with the Yugoslav authorities. An agreement between Turkey, Yugoslavia, and Greece is about to be established. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>Belgrade. When Turkish Foreign Minister Rushdi arrived here, he was warmly welcomed. All newspapers said that this trip had special political significance. The treaty of friendship and non-aggression, recently concluded in Geneva, will be formally signed by the Turkish Foreign Minister and the Yugoslav Foreign Minister this afternoon. The newspapers also said that the Turkish Foreign Minister's stay here will involve a fundamental discussion of the overall Balkan situation, which may lead to a more far-reaching treaty. The Turkish Foreign Minister once said that he personally opposed revising the peace treaty and advocated maintaining the status quo. This statement has attracted much attention.

<p>(Washington) U.S. Army Chief of Staff, Major General MacArthur, urgently recommended in his annual report to Army Chief of Staff Dunn today that the Army's strength and effectiveness were far below the danger line, advocating that the regular army should have at least 165,000 soldiers and 12,000 officers, supplemented by an organized reserve force. He stated that the budgets for 1932 and previous years were insufficient to maintain an appropriate army. Now that there are discussions on limiting land armaments internationally, the Army should be trained into an elite force. However, today's Army has not been able to become an important part of national defense. In terms of military strength, except for certain special weapons, such as mobile artillery and bomber aircraft, it is still far behind to a considerable extent. This spring, the Army Department recruited destitute young men and youths, paying them one dollar a day and forming them into security teams. In terms of rapid mobilization effectiveness and economy, it has been better than those recruited in 1917. In addition, the General Staff has prepared a plan to divide the country into four major military districts, bounded by natural defense lines, to facilitate mobilization in the event of an emergency.

<p>(Berlin) Recently, there have been widespread rumors outside Germany that Germany has begun to rearm and educate young children with militarism, etc. However, people in the German government have solemnly declared that Germany still does not have a single tank or a flight squadron, and that the military organizations still do not have heavy artillery and other armaments prohibited by the Treaty of Versailles. Therefore, the various rumors abroad are either based on false reports or deliberately fabricated to re-ignite anti-German sentiments. Although successive German governments have tried to expand the country's defense strategy as much as possible within the scope of the treaty to resist the growing military strength of its powerful neighbors, they have never gone beyond the constraints of the treaty. As for the claim that Germany is engaging in educating children with revenge and humiliation as the foundation, the German authorities cited Hitler's recent conversation with Bellinon, in which Hitler said, "There are no warmongers in Germany, but the people of all countries have the duty to defend their motherland." It can be seen that patriotism and aggression cannot be confused. (National News Agency, 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) A dispute between military police and police occurred at Xiaguan Station on the 27th. This morning at 7:00, more than 200 armed police officers, led by Zhang Lie, entered the city. The small train at the Xiaguan riverside was just starting to fire up and waiting to depart. A man in plain clothes was sitting in a corner of the carriage. Because there were few carriages and many people, the police ordered him to get off the train. The man claimed to be a soldier from the Postal and Telegraph Inspection Office of the Military Police Headquarters, sending official documents, and refused to get off the train for fear of delaying official business. Seeing his stubbornness, the police forcibly pushed him off the train, causing the soldier to injure his wrist bone, bleed and swell his left eye, and injure his waist with a rifle butt. At that time, the Director of the First Bureau, Zhang Lie, saw that an incident had occurred, so he ordered the police to send the soldier to the Xiaguan Military Police Team, saying that it was a conflict between military police and police. The commander of the military police team, Wei Zhihuai, asked about the soldier's name, Li Yongfu, and found that he was indeed the one sending official business, so he sent him to the inspection office for processing. The inspection office was very regretful that the soldier sending the letter was beaten by armed police officers, and that the director of the police station, Zhang Lie, did not stop it. In addition to sending Li Yongfu to the military medical office of the headquarters to get a medical certificate for the injuries, he also reported to the Commander of the Military Police, Gu Zhenglun, for verification.

<p>(Nanjing) Liu Wenhui, the Commander-in-Chief of the Sichuan-Xikang Border Defense, telegraphed the following: (1) Tibetan troops are fully equipped and attempting to cross the river for a fierce attack, and preparations have been completed and war is imminent; (2) Qingke and Zhonggu, two buffer zones, are clearly stated in the treaty, but now the Tibetan-appointed Qingzeng Lama is leading more than 100 cavalry soldiers and horses to reside there without authorization, intending to provoke; (3) the return of the secret investigation sent to Tibet reports that the Tibetan side had prepared three months of bread and stored military food two months ago; (4) many Tibetan soldiers and civilians have been mobilized to Lower Pass from various places, and Tibetan soldiers and local militia have been moving around. It is found that the deadline for the Tibetan side to reply is from November 5 to December 2, which is approaching. If there is no satisfactory reply, judging from the various circumstances, the war will be inevitable. In addition to flying to inform the officers and soldiers at the front line to remain calm and vigilant, Huang is also sending appropriate personnel to conduct serious negotiations in accordance with the treaty to urge them to wake up and maintain peace. However, the outcome is still difficult to predict, and the front line has inconvenient transportation, no telecommunications, and extremely difficult winter ice transport.

<p>(Nanjing) Gao Dengting, of the Fujian Provincial Committee, because he refused to echo the reactionary organization, came to Nanjing on the evening of the 26th. He went to Shibanqiao to meet Chairman Lin and report on the Fujian situation. He also met with Wang Jingwei at noon on the 27th. Within a few days, he will leave Nanjing to go to Jiangxi to see Chiang, reporting everything. Gao said that the brewing of the Fujian incident had been going on for months, but he did not expect it to advocate alliance with Russia and accommodation of the Communists. When the incident of the 19th was about to occur, because he did not casually support it, he avoided it by staying in a residence in Cangshan, across from Fujian, for several days and was monitored and searched. In order to avoid the dangerous situation, at dawn on the 23rd of this month, he climbed over the wall, injured himself, and took the China Aviation Company's Shanghai-Guangdong plane to Shanghai, arriving at noon that day. He has been recuperating and resting in Shanghai for several days and only took a train to Nanjing last night. It is now scheduled to meet with Wang Jingwei at noon on the 28th to report the entire course of the Fujian Incident in detail. After the meeting, he will leave Nanjing to go to Nanchang to see Chiang. Gao also said that because he did not join the actions of the people in Fujian, he felt unfree. He knew nothing else, but he once saw the design of their so-called People's Government's abolition of the party-state and the new national emblem, which was half red and half green, with a horizontal black line in the middle, and a yellow five-pointed star inlaid in the center of the flag. It is said that the five-pointed star represents the Social Democratic Party, the red symbolizes revolution, and the blue represents peace. A certain Shanghai newspaper reported the other day that their new national emblem was a right half red above and blue below, and a left half red, yellow, blue, white, and black five colors, which is inaccurate, because I personally saw the former. Gao also said that although the reactionary organization in Fujian Province has been established, its members are complex and there are too many internal contradictions. Although they are temporarily united at this time, he believes that they will eventually disintegrate. It is reported that the 19th Route Army has begun to differentiate internally. He personally speculates that it may be a rumor because the 19th Route Army previously had two factions, the Chiang faction and the Cai faction. However, it has only just been launched and will certainly not differentiate so quickly. Therefore, the rumor that Qu Shou-nian has led senior military officers to leave Fujian Province must be as unreliable as the previous saying that Cai Tingkai does not approve of the reactionary organization. The 19th Route Army originally had six divisions, which had not yet been replenished after suffering losses during the suppression of bandits, so they are short of their full complement. In addition, Weng Zhaoyuan's recruited bandits and Chen Guohui's old troops number no more than a few thousand. Their only attempt now is to peep into Zhejiang because they think Guangdong is not easy to attack, while Zhejiang is easier to capture. However, it is heard that the central government has heavily fortified the border between Zhejiang and Fujian and will definitely not allow it to be invaded. (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) At the memorial week of Central University, President Luo Jialun reported on the problem of the Fujian Incident. Standing on the perspective of a Central Committee member, his observation on the Fujian situation roughly meant that Chen Mingshu's temperament is different from others and he likes impulsive words and deeds. We can prove the cause of this Fujian Incident entirely by Chen Mingshu's impulsive instigation, not a purposeful move, based on his past behavior and words. Therefore, we can get three results when we speculate on the future trend of the Fujian situation today: (1) Because Fujian is adjacent to Japanese-occupied Taiwan, Japan will inevitably occupy eastern Fujian. (2) Because Fujian is adjacent to Jiangxi, the Communist Party will inevitably occupy western Fujian. (3) If the pseudo-government attacks Zhejiang to the north, the Communist Party will definitely enter southern Fujian; if it attacks Guangdong to the south, the Communist Party will inevitably enter northern Fujian. It will gain nothing from the occupation, and the 19th Route Army will be completely sacrificed, which is a pity. Finally, Luo also said that political changes in our country have always been related to a certain country. This Fujian Incident is certainly no exception. Before the Fujian Incident, there was Yano active in the north, and there was Yamamura active in Fujian. Therefore, the behavior of Li Jishen, Chen Mingshu, Chen Youren, and others is enough to destroy the country and more. (27th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 106th Memorial Week at 9:00 a.m. on the 27th. Dai Chuanxian, Chen Lifu, Li Ciwen, Li Zonghuang, Li Jingzhai, and other staff members, totaling more than 400 people, attended. Yi Chuanxian chaired the meeting and made a report, stating that after the Fujian Incident occurred, he felt that it was due to the lack of strong will and firm belief among the comrades of the party. Because of the lack of strong will, they are often instigated by others, and because of the lack of firm belief, they are tired of the revolution and the doctrine. If we want to save the country, we must eliminate this kind of mentality and take the legacy of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, trustworthiness, righteousness, harmony, and peace as the principles of self-cultivation and dealing with others. If comrades do so, the party will be united, and if the people of the country do so, the foundation of the country will be consolidated, and there will be no false clouds of rebellion and national subjugation. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a Memorial Week on the morning of the 27th. Lin Sen, Shao Yuanchong, Zhu Jiahua, Chen Gongbo, Chen Shaokuan, He Yaozu, Wei Huai, Lu Chao, Li Yuanding, Zhang Ji, Lin Xiang, Niu Yongjian, and more than 400 staff members of the National Government attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Shao Yuanchong reported on the Fujian Incident, stating that this Fujian Incident is very serious. The most serious of the anti-revolutionary acts that have occurred in the past were Yuan Shikai's proclamation as emperor and Chen Jiongming's betrayal of the Premier. However, they did not go so far as to sacrifice the interests of the entire country to foreign countries. This time, Chen Mingshu and others advocated rebellion, not only betraying the party and betraying the Premier, but also selling out the entire Chinese nation. The seriousness of the situation cannot be compared with the past rebellions. Therefore, this kind of traitorous behavior will inevitably be opposed by the people of the whole country. Moreover, the members of the pseudo-Fujian government are complex, with no definite doctrine, no strict organization, and no leader to lead the masses. Recently, they have been closely linked with the Red bandits, providing the bandits with weapons and food. Peng Dehuai, the leader of the Red bandits, has already gone to Fuzhou to participate. In addition, they are colluding with Japanese imperialism, which is extremely sinful and the evidence of their treacherous acts is obvious. The Red bandits' acts of killing, arson, rape, and plunder are factual and absolutely unsuitable for our country's national conditions. Only the Three People's Principles created by our Premier, integrating Europe and the United States, and in accordance with the characteristics required by our country's national conditions, such as striving to realize them, can save the country. This rebellion will enable the people to more deeply understand the doctrine of the Kuomintang and increase the unity of the party's strength. He hopes that comrades will work hard and be determined to quell this Fujian Incident. (27th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<p>Suiyuan Correspondence, Huang Shaohong, Zhao Pilian, and others returned to Suiyuan from Bailingmiao at 4:00 p.m. on the 19th. In advance, the Chairman of the Suiyuan Provincial Government, Fu Zuoyi, the Commander of the 70th Division, Wang Jingguo, the Directors of various Departments, and representatives of various agencies all went to the Beisha Liang suburbs to welcome them. The army, military police, police, and military band all lined up to greet them. When Zhao Pilian's car arrived first, Huang Shaohong, Xu Tingyao, and others also arrived soon. They got out of the car at Beisha Liang, exchanged greetings with Chuan Zuoyi and others, and then took a car straight to the Suiyuan Hotel. The street was heavily guarded. Many people came to the province with Huang and Zhao, including the Zhasak and Shabazi of the Siziwang Banner. After Huang got out of the car and rested for a while, he met with newspaper reporters at the Suiyuan Hotel. In the evening, Fu Zuoyi set up a banquet at his private residence to welcome Huang and others. Xu Tingyao, having lived in Mongolia for a long time, went to Datong that night, and after visiting Yungang on the 20th, he returned to Beiping. The Mongolian-Han Joint Celebration Conference will be held within a few days.</p>
<p>Huang Shaohong's remarks roughly stated: "We waited in Bailingmiao and talked for a long time, conveying the Central Government's intentions one by one. We did not recognize any of their requests for a unified organization. The matter of dividing a province into autonomous regions has been accepted, with Suiyuan as the first autonomous government and Chahar as the second autonomous government. In accepting the principle, we must take into account the issue of the Central Government's authority. This proposition is still not affirmative and must be carefully considered by the Central Government and the Legislative Yuan before a detailed decision can be made. There will be no changes in the county governance problem. The defense problem has been studied based on economic principles, with the overall goal of not harming the interests of the Mongolians. We have sent personnel to various leagues and banners to conduct a detailed investigation of the animal husbandry industry, and there are no results yet. The Central Government intends to establish state-run pastures and private pastures to jointly seek improvement, which can also increase national income. All tax revenues that should be managed by the leagues and banners will be clearly divided to avoid confusion. The organization and expenses of the autonomous region government will be allocated by the Central Government. The location of its establishment has not yet been determined, etc."</p>
<p>According to Zhao Pilian's remarks, De Wang and Yun Wang canceled the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Government plan and proposed to establish autonomous governments in separate districts. A written report was submitted to your department. This is only a general decision and does not violate the plan set by the Central Government. According to the Central Government's plan, the Suiyuan and Wuyi League governments would establish Mongolian Political Affairs Committees in addition to the various departments. Now, De Wang and others have a new plan with different names, establishing the first and second autonomous region governments. The Chahar Mongolian banners will follow this example. De Wang and others' opinions will be conveyed to the Central Government, and there are many places that need to be specified in detail, etc. Zhao also said that Bailingmiao has hundreds of miles of uninhabited land. In such a vast area with so few people, everything is not easy to carry out. From Bailingmiao to Wuchuan, I felt like I was entering a prosperous area from a desolate place. Wuchuan is like Shanghai to the inland compared to Bailingmiao. Returning to Suiyuan is like walking into Paris! He couldn't help but laugh. (19th)</p>
<h3 id="e86">Guizhou Province's Attitude Towards the Fujian Incident丨Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi Have No Temporary Expression丨 <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication, since the Fujian incident occurred, Guangdong has decided to take the main purpose of securing peace and democracy. However, the attitude of Guizhou Province is extremely noteworthy to the general public. The southwest five provinces included in the Fujian situation, Guizhou Province actually occupies one of them, and Li Jishen is the chairman of the new situation in Fujian, which vaguely has the appearance of summoning the two Guangdong provinces. However, Bai Chongxi is relatively down-to-earth, first consolidating the internal affairs of Guizhou Province, and then linking with Guizhou, Yunnan, and other provinces to consolidate the foundation before developing northward. Now, the Fujian situation suddenly organizes a people's government, advocating equalization of land rights and realizing the acceptance of the Communists. Whether this kind of political program is approved by Bai is a major issue for Guizhou Province to develop northward. Moreover, since Guangdong has now expressed that it will not participate in the Fujian incident, the geographical situation of Guizhou and Fujian is blocked by Guangdong Province, which is also a barrier to the union of Fujian and Guizhou. Therefore, the timing of Guizhou Province joining the Fujian situation may not have arrived yet. Therefore, in recent days, those in Guangdong in the military and political circles of Guizhou Province have made explanations on the attitude temporarily adopted by Guizhou Province. According to Huang Heling, the former division commander and current Wuzhou Customs Superintendent of Guizhou Province, Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi, the deputy commander-in-chief of the Fourth Group Army, are still in Nanning. Other rumors are not true. The Guizhou provincial defense army, the three divisions of the current Seventh Army, are stationed in Guilin, Qingyuan, and Liuzhou, and the Fifteenth Army is in Youjiang, Nanning, and Pingdong. There has been no movement for several months, etc. In addition, Zhang Renmin, chief of staff of the headquarters of the Fourth Group Army, made a statement yesterday, saying that Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren has only returned to Guizhou for more than a month. Because he stayed in Guangdong for a long time last time, he has many things to deal with after returning to Guizhou. Moreover, Bai Chongxi was ill two weeks ago and is still recuperating. Most of the affairs are handled by Li. Recently, he planned to go to various places in the province to inspect the army, but he has not had time to go. Since the changes in the Fujian situation, Li may come to Guangdong in the near future. The saying that Chen Mingshu is the commander of the five provinces of Fujian, Jiangxi, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Guizhou is very bizarre. The recent Fujian incident has been made public, and Guizhou Province has not participated, which shows that the rumors some time ago were inaccurate. In short, Guizhou Province is now under the leadership of the Southwest Executive Department and the Political Committee in terms of politics and party affairs, and should take the propositions of these two agencies as its propositions, and there is no special expression. The interests of the two Guangdong provinces are closely related. At this time of changing situation, we can only unite and go to the national crisis together, and take bandit suppression and resistance to foreign invasion as our duties, and there is nothing else to talk about, etc. Zhang's remarks are like this, but it is not yet known whether he can represent the true attitude of Guizhou Province.

<h3 id="e87">Recent Developments Between Fujian and Guangdong After the Fujian Incident, Guangdong Troops Entering Jiangxi to Suppress Bandits Have Stopped Advancing, Troops Stationed in Chaozhou and Meizhou Are Building Large Trenches <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence, the Fujian political change, Guangdong Province is adjacent to it, and the news has greatly affected the market. The economy has shaken as a result. Chaoshan is particularly close to Fujian Province. Silver firms have already started manipulating the market, rising and falling several times a day. Therefore, various rumors also arise as a result. The various troops that previously entered Jiangxi to suppress bandits have stopped advancing in Guangdong and Jiangxi. The so-called plan to attack Huichang and Junmenling is no longer discussed. The Third Army Headquarters moved to Meixian, which was originally convenient for taking into account the Fujian and Jiangxi borders. Such as Jiaoling, Dapu, Raoping and other counties adjacent to the Fujian border, and Pingyuan, Xingning, Heping, Lianping and other counties adjacent to the Jiangxi border, have all added large troops stationed, taking defensive measures against incoming invasions. The officers of various armies pay great attention to the development of highway transportation. For example, Huang Renhuan's plan for nine highways connecting Shanghang, Wuping to Songkou, Jiaoling, Pingyuan and Xingning has already started surveying. All residents within ten miles of the highway, regardless of male or female, have an obligation to be conscripted. Those who are conscripted receive a tea and meal fee of one dime and a half per day. The SanNan Road highway on the Jiangxi border has also been greatly developed recently, but there are very few vehicles. It takes about two days to arrive at Chaoshan from the Jiangxi border via Xingning and Fengshun. Shantou to Huizhou also officially opened on the 22nd. Due to the development of highways, military mobilization is very flexible. After the Third Army Headquarters moved to Meicheng, all the equipment was quite complete. The military medical office and the health team are located in the Zhendong Weaving Factory in Shuinanpu across the river. Shuinanpu is adjacent to Fengshun. Matoushan, Tongguzhang, and Yetian in Fengshun are all adjacent to Meixian. The mountains, ridges, cliffs, and rocks in the area are extremely rugged. The Guangdong army started to equip the defensive works a few months ago and spent hundreds of thousands of yuan, but they have not yet been completed. Now they are also conscripting civilians to rush to build them, and they must be completed by the end of this month. There are also considerable defensive works in Baxiang Mountain bordering Wuhua, Pantian Jiuhua Tian Dong bordering Chaoan, Tangkeng Luojiayu, Huizhai, and Wujingfu bordering Jieyang, and Shuikou, Baiye, Jingxin, Jiulongzhang, Douxi, and Ganxi bordering Xingning. The Guangdong army's deployment in the two counties of Mei and Feng is obviously targeting Fujian.</p>
<p>After the Third Army moved to Mei, Commander Li Yangjing was in the province due to business and did not follow the army. All the important duties of the army headquarters were performed by Chief of Staff Zhou Zhi. The two divisions of the army were assigned to the command of the Second Column, with Huang Renhuan responsible for the command. Chief of Staff Zhou has now been transferred to the province for another mission. Chen Jitang has separately appointed Ouyang Xin, deputy commander of the Eighth Division, to succeed Zhou as chief of staff and act on behalf of the Third Army. The Third Army has also established a rear office in Shantou to handle rear transportation and supply matters. Zhang Ruigui is responsible for maintaining law and order in all parts of Chaoshan.</p>
<p>The situation on the Fujian-Guangdong border is that due to the Guangdong army's strict suppression of bandits, most of the bandits and Communists have fled to Fujian and are hiding in various places. Only one regiment of the 19th Route Army is stationed in Zhaoan, Yunxiao, and Zhangpu counties, and the local militia has weak self-defense capabilities. For example, last month, the county seat of Zhaoan County was counterattacked by the Wushan Shen Donghai bandit gang, and the shops in the county seat suffered great losses. Party and government agencies and personnel of militia autonomous organizations all fled, and order gradually recovered after more than ten days. The mountains on the Fujian-Guangdong border stretch for hundreds of miles, and it is easiest to hide and gather bandits in the caves. Moreover, all bandit gangs contain Communist elements, and they must distribute leaflets and paste slogans whenever they cause disturbances, claiming to fight local tyrants. The 19th Route Army is stationed between Longyan, Zhangping, and Zhangzhou, and is unable to take care of everything. The Guangdong army stationed in Dapu is also inconvenient to intervene. Even if the two sides simultaneously attack, it is not easy in the thousands of layers of mountains. According to returnees from western Fujian, the 19th Route Army is stationed in Longyan, Shizhong, Hexi, Nanjing, and Zhangping, with three armies of Zhang Yan, Qu Shounian, and Shen Guanghan. Huang Renhuan's Guangdong army has entered Wuping, Shanghang, and Yongding with six regiments, but they are all like crossbows shooting tigers, and they will not fire easily unless the tiger comes. Longyan, above Liancheng and Shanghang, are bandit areas, or places where red and white intersect. Even the bandit areas that have been recovered have not been able to restore their original state to this day, because the original land contracts have been burned, the land slopes have been plowed, and the area of land has been allocated. Various people have been divided, and the control of physical labor, mental labor, and agricultural economy has become habitual, and it is impossible to restore the original state in any case. The output of rice and grain in the bandit area has greatly increased after the land was divided, and the output of bamboo paper in Changting has also sharply increased, but it has been blockaded by the national army and cannot be transported out. The bandit area lacks only salt, medicinal materials, ammunition, kerosene, and coal, etc. (22nd)</p>

<p>Yesterday (26th) at about 5:00 p.m., a Hanglai train heading to Shanghai entered Songjiang Station. Two modern women wearing gorgeous cheongsams and leather shoes got off the train, followed closely by two burly men. After inquiries, it was found that the women were carrying handguns and their intentions were unknown. The followers were detectives from Hangzhou who had learned of the matter in the train. When the train heading to Shanghai passed Songjiang, the two modern women, with their brows furrowed, were escorted by the followers onto the train and returned to Hangzhou to be handed over to the authorities for investigation.</p>

<p>A net boat moored in Xidu, Huangpu River, was found to have been robbed of more than 400 yuan last night. The owner of the net boat went forward to try to seize the robber, but was beaten and injured. The net boat had a deposit of more than 100 yuan and recently received a payment of 300 yuan, which was coveted by the bandits. So they quietly gathered many people and went to Xidu. Taking advantage of the unpreparedness, they boarded the boat and robbed it. The banknotes and foreign currency were hidden in the stove by the owner of the net boat, but they were also robbed. It is difficult to believe that there was no prior clue.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Vegetable Vendors on Daoqian Street in Suzhou Oppose Moving Into the Vegetable Market <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Daoqian Street and Yuyuxiang near Xumen are busy commercial areas, especially the vegetable market in the morning. Recently, the county government built a small vegetable market in Xiliku and ordered the vegetable vendors there to move in together. The monthly donations are contracted by recognized merchants and levied on the vegetable vendors. However, the general vegetable vendors have never paid donations for business, and the business community there also believes that if the vegetable market is moved away, the business of oil, rice, wine, meat, southern goods, groceries and other stores will inevitably be greatly affected, so they immediately helped the vegetable vendors and opposed moving into the vegetable market. After repeated attempts to persuade them to no avail, yesterday (27th) Patrol Officer Li Yin of the 25th Precinct, under orders, persuaded the vegetable vendors to move into the vegetable market and at the same time prohibited street stalls. The shops along Daoqian Street immediately recruited general vegetable vendors to move into the shops to do business to show their resistance. Patrol Officer Li failed to exhaust his plans, so he prohibited the shops from setting up vegetable stalls and ordered them to move into the vegetable market to do business. Therefore, the merchants were furious and went on strike at 7:30, with signs on the doors saying that business was not free and they could only suspend business. The patrol officer had no choice but to report to the Public Security Bureau for instructions. The Inspector General Xu Jiarui arrived at the scene and mediated at the Daoyang Fire Brigade. He temporarily allowed the vegetable vendors to do business in the shops and persuaded them to open the market. The shops then opened the market at 9:00, but the vegetable vendors in the Yuyuxiang area who had moved into the vegetable market on the previous (26th) also moved out of the vegetable market and continued to do business in Yuyuxiang after hearing the news. There was no one in the vegetable market. The recognized merchant of the vegetable market felt that his rights were involved and would lose his capital, so he applied to the county government for relief.</p>

<p>In the fifth district of the county (Tianshang City), at Gaoxiang Lane in Xiwan, Chang'an Bridge, a villager named Gao Pan'gen, 41 years old, who works as a farmer, lives in poverty. Around 2 AM yesterday morning, six bandits suddenly arrived, each wielding knives and wooden sticks. They pried open the door and dragged Pan'gen from his bed, demanding he reveal the location of his hidden silver. Pan'gen replied that he had no money, which angered the bandits. They then pulled out knives and stabbed Pan'gen's right foot three times in quick succession. Blood flowed profusely, and he collapsed in extreme pain. Not satisfied, the bandits then broke into Gao Xi'gen's house, threatening him into silence. They also stabbed Gao's grandmother on her right wrist and other parts of her body. Subsequently, they rummaged through chests and cabinets, searching and looting at will. They stole over 200 yuan in silver that had been collected. After obtaining the loot, the bandits fled with loud shouts.</p>

<p>Chen Jintang, a villager in the sixth village of Beixin Gate, Dongzhang City, in the tenth district of this county, is currently over 40 years old. He married a woman named Wang, who is over middle age but of a fierce disposition. Jintang is henpecked and fears his wife like a tiger. Besides farming, Chen also works as a cook. Whenever there are events nearby, Chen is hired to cook. The other day (the 25th) at night, Chen returned from cooking for a certain family, feeling a slight stomach ache, resembling sha. He immediately collapsed on the bed. Unexpectedly, his wife, for some unknown reason, flew into a rage, first scolding her husband severely, then conceiving a murderous intent. She went outside and grabbed a bamboo dustpan. Re-entering the room and seeing no one around, she seized the opportunity while Jintang was unprepared, slamming the dustpan on Jintang's neck and forcefully pressing down, killing him. Jintang screamed for help, but the event happened quickly. By the time his younger brother entered to rescue him, he had already died. The assailant, Chen Wang, was immediately apprehended. At dawn, the incident was reported to the Ninth Sub-Station of the Public Security Bureau, and the murderer was taken into custody. The district chief, Gui Shutang, personally reported the matter to the county. The county government will now dispatch an investigating officer to the village for an autopsy.</p>

<p>Citizens of Jiangyin, including Feng Yuanzhang and Chen Tianjue, along with 128 others, have jointly telegraphed the Provincial Government's Department of Education, stating that since the establishment of the Jiangyin Education Bureau, it has wasted over ten thousand yuan annually, while educational funding has increased. Education is deteriorating daily, with the bureau serving as a superfluous and flawed entity, giving rise to numerous abuses. In terms of financial matters, the bureau has yet to submit its 1921 fiscal year report, while owing rural schools eight months' worth of fees. The Department of Education, to protect Jiangyin's education, dispatched four provincial supervisors, Yi Feng, Ruan Liu, and others, to Cheng to conduct a special inspection lasting three months. Their inability to promptly depart further proves the superfluous nature of the Jiangyin Education Bureau. Therefore, they earnestly request that the Jiangyin Education Bureau be promptly abolished and its functions be managed by a county-level department, thereby streamlining the system and facilitating supervision. The remaining bureau funds can then be redirected to educational initiatives, offering a glimmer of hope for Jiangyin's education.</p>

<h3 id="e103">Local News: Naval Students from the Mawei Naval Academy Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday, Led by Du Xigui. A Total of 151 Students. Chen Zaofan, Yu Qiaqing, and Others Greeted Them. This Morning, They Will Sail to Beijing on the Wanxiang Yuan Steamer <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Following the Fujian political upheaval, all naval-affiliated institutions in Fujian were taken over by the Nineteenth Route Army. However, the Mawei Naval Academy, although also occupied as a garrison, allowed the students to leave Fujian safely. Currently, over a hundred students and faculty members of the academy, led by Principal Du Xigui, arrived safely in Shanghai on the Wanxiang steamer yesterday afternoon. They are scheduled to be transported to Beijing this morning on the same steamer to temporarily study at the Torpedo School. The details of their arrival are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e104">The Wanxiang Arrives in Shanghai and Sails to Beijing This Morning <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>The Wanxiang steamer set sail from Mawei on the afternoon of the 25th and arrived in Shanghai at 1:30 PM yesterday, docking at Pier No. 2 of the Ning Shao Terminal at the Sixteenth Bund. Prior to the arrival, the Shanghai naval authorities, having received word of the Wanxiang's imminent arrival, dispatched two platoons of soldiers from the Naval Guard Battalion, accompanied by the Jiangnan and Jiang'an small steamers from the Jiangnan Shipyard, to protect the pier. The First District Office of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, along with the Criminal Investigation Team and the Water Police Bureau, also sent small steamers and detectives to the pier to provide security. Among the welcoming personnel were Chen Maoxian, adjutant of the First Fleet of the Navy; Ren Guanghai, Navy Staff; Chen Yongqin, captain of the Tongji warship; Chen Zaofan, deputy director of the Jiangnan Shipyard; Yu Qiaqing, manager of the Sanbei Company; Guo Yongrong, former director of the Fuzhou Public Security Bureau; and several dozen family members and friends of the students. At 2 PM, after the Wanxiang steamer docked, the welcoming personnel met Principal Du Xigui in the main cabin. Subsequently, Du disembarked and was transported by a Navy car to his brother Shenchen's residence on Fulu Li Road. The students remained on board, preparing to be transported to Nanjing this morning on the same steamer to study at the Capital Naval Torpedo Camp. Du will also escort them to Beijing this morning to report everything to the Ministry of the Navy.</p>
<h3 id="e105">Du Xigui Discusses the Current Situation in Fujian <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>This reporter met with Du Xigui, principal of the Naval Academy, aboard the ship and inquired about the situation in Fuzhou and his departure from Fujian. He provided a detailed account, stating, "We boarded the ship on the afternoon of the 24th and departed from Fujian on the afternoon of the 25th, arriving in Shanghai at this moment. The entire contingent consisted of 132 students and 21 faculty members. Upon departure, one student fell ill and was unable to travel, so he was advised to stay behind temporarily. Therefore, only 131 students came along. All school assets remaining in Fujian are currently being safeguarded by the garrison troops. In short, the Fujian authorities treated the academy very well this time. This was the result of my joint appeal with veteran naval elder Sa Zhenbing to Cai (Tingkai). Cai's original intention was that even the students' luggage and books could not be taken out. From now on, all faculty and students will only go to Beijing to study temporarily at the Torpedo School. The situation in Fuzhou remains normal. Naval institutions in the Mawei area can be said to be completely taken over, so there is inevitably a slight atmosphere of fear there. Governor He Gonggan has taken office. Mr. Sa (Zhenbing) is only presiding over local affairs in the capacity of a guest. Any external rumors of high-ranking positions are completely inaccurate. Currently, among the people of Fujian in Fujian, only Mr. Sa can speak with authority. The naval training camp has been completely disbanded, and most of the marines have been taken over. Those who have not been taken over are now moving towards the areas of Changle and Lianjiang. Commander Lin Bingzhou is currently in Sandu. When we passed the Changmen Fortress from Mawei, we did not see any Japanese warships stationed there. Huang Qixiang is indeed in Fuzhou, but I do not know the details of other important figures in Fujian because I have not met them." At that time, the reporter asked again if Fujian had communist leanings. Du said, "This is probably just talk. There are no real communists in China at all." After the conversation, he said goodbye.</p>
<h3 id="e106">Students Say the Navy Was Greatly Deceived <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The reporter then selected one of the older students and inquired about the recent situation in Fujian. According to him, the entire student body of our school in Mawei is 132 students. Today, only one person did not come due to illness. The school was originally divided into four classes, two navigation classes and two engineering classes. The students came from all provinces, not just Fujian. For example, I graduated from the first class of the Nanjing Naval Training Camp and transferred to Mawei for further studies. Starting from the 22nd, troops were dispatched to guard the front and rear gates of our school, and no one was allowed to enter or exit. Later, after the principal negotiated with the authorities, Cai Tingkai issued a handwritten order allowing them to leave the school. Therefore, from the 24th, when we boarded the Wanxiang steamer, when students left the school, in addition to books, any slightly bulky luggage had to be inspected by the guards before they could be released. Therefore, from 1 PM until about 7 PM in the evening, the entire contingent completed boarding the ship. On the afternoon of the 25th, we left Mawei and passed the Changmen Fortress without being inspected. The commander of the Changmen Fortress is currently Yun Yinglin, but the gun levers of the fort had already been taken away by the Navy. Yang Tingying did have an appointment as Naval Commander, but he was only utilized by the Fujian authorities for one day. Yang then avoided the position and did not take it. The situation in the provincial capital is still normal, but the common people are not allowed to casually discuss politics. Anyone who does so will be arrested. The flags issued are red on top and blue on the bottom, with a yellow circle in the middle. They are mostly forced on merchants and civilians to hang. Today, on the same ship to Shanghai, in addition to our school's faculty and students, there are also about forty or fifty soldiers from the training camp and marines from other provinces. Because the soldiers of the training camp were disbanded by the Fujian army and had no place to stand, and a small number of marines, because they were registered in other provinces, were unwilling to be transferred to the Fujian army, so they changed their uniforms and secretly fled to Shanghai. In short, the Changmen Fortress, the Mawei training camp, and the marine corps were greatly deceived by the Fujian authorities this time. Because when the Fujian coup first occurred, the Fujian authorities declared that all naval institutions would not be touched. Later, as the Nineteenth Route Army gradually advanced, the various institutions in Mawei saw that the situation was not right and prepared to withdraw, but it was already too late. Fortress Commander Li Mengbin, at this tense moment, boarded the Jiangyuan warship and went to Sandu. Among the Fujian newspapers, only the Minbao, because it was run by the Japanese, slightly expressed central government opinions. All others were taken over by the Nineteenth Route Army, so their opinions are completely biased towards the Fujian authorities, etc.</p>

Li Liejun's Mediation is Unlikely to Succeed Due to the Lack of Expression from Both Sides and Can Only Be Left to its Natural Course. <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xin Xin News Agency, sources close to Central Committee member Li Liejun told reporters from the Xin Xin News Agency yesterday that Li was deeply saddened by the Fujian coup and had sent a special representative to Fujian to investigate the truth. He also sent a letter to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang, offering his opinions and proposing mediation. However, as of yesterday, the representative sent to Fujian had not yet returned to Shanghai, and Chiang Kai-shek's reply had not been received. The Fujian coup is deteriorating daily, so Li's mediation, based on the current situation, is unlikely to succeed and can only be left to its natural course. Although the Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai have met frequently in recent days, they have not discussed the mediation of the Fujian coup because neither the central government nor the Fujian authorities have expressed any concrete opinions.</p>

The Remaining Central Committee Members in Shanghai are in the Process of Contacting Each Other for a Joint Meeting. <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, a reporter from the Guowen News Agency met with Central Committee member Xue Dubi and asked about Feng Yuxiang's attitude after being appointed chairman of the Fujian Provincial Economic Committee, and the attendance of the Central Committee members in Shanghai at the upcoming Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee. Xue's response is recorded below.</p>
<p>Feng Does Not Leave Shandong: Recently, I have still had frequent correspondence with Mr. Feng, inquiring about his recent situation. I learned that he is devoted to studying in Tai'an, not asking about external affairs, and has no intention of leaving Shandong. Since the Fujian coup, although rumors have been rampant and he has recently been appointed under false pretenses, Feng has not expressed any opinions on their actions, so there is no need to deny the rumors.</p>
<p>Fourth Plenary Session: The notice for the convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee has been received. I am currently busy with legal affairs in Shanghai and have no spare time, so I am afraid it will be difficult to attend and I am not prepared to submit any proposals. Mr. Feng also has no intention of participating. As for the claim that the Central Committee members remaining in Shanghai plan to hold a joint meeting in Shanghai before the session, it has not yet been realized. Generally speaking, they are still in the process of contacting each other.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Guangdong line of the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) carried passengers for the first time on the 24th. The details of the accident and rescue have been reported in previous newspapers. Today is the southbound flight date, and it will continue to operate as usual. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Replacement Aircraft Flight <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>After the No. 16 aircraft, originally scheduled to fly the route, was damaged in the accident, the No. 17 aircraft was specially transferred to fly the route. Although the original pilot, Lumiere, has been discharged from the hospital, he still needs to rest. The co-pilot, Amor, was seriously injured and is still being treated at the Hongen Hospital, so the flight will be piloted by pilot Gast and co-pilot Wood.</p>

<h3 id="e117">After the Fujian Coup, Foreign Ships Dominate Freight Transportation. China Merchants and Ning Shao Ships Have All Been Suspended. Passenger Trains Operate as Usual, but Freight Trains Are Reduced. <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Since the Fujian coup occurred, all Chinese ships operating on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line have been suspended and have stopped calling at Xiamen. Only foreign merchants continue to operate as usual, so they have monopolized freight transportation. The freight transportation of other ships and trains in various places has also been affected. The details are recorded below.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Chinese Merchants Suspend Service on the Shanghai-Fujian Route <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese merchant ships operating on the Shanghai-Fuzhou route include the state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Qinshun, the privately-owned Sanbei Company's Wanxiang, and the Chang'an Company's Hua'an. The foreign merchant ship is the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Jiesheng. A total of four ships. Today, China Merchants Bureau's Taishun has stopped operating on the Shanghai-Fuzhou and Shanghai-Xiamen lines. Hua'an is now operating on the Shanghai-Tianjin line. The Sanbei Company's Wanxiang, after arriving in Shanghai from Fuzhou yesterday, decided to switch to the Shanghai-Hankou line.</p>
<h3 id="e119">Foreign Merchants Continue as Usual, Dominating Freight Transportation <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Jardine Matheson &amp; Co.'s Jiesheng, which operates on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line, departed from Fuzhou the other day and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai today. Due to foreign relations, it has been decided to operate as usual and is scheduled to depart from Shanghai on the first day of next month. As for the South China-bound ships of China Merchants, Sanbei, and other Chinese merchants, they have stopped calling at Xiamen. However, the South China-bound ships of foreign merchants such as Nissin, Jardine Matheson, and Taikoo continue as usual, so foreign merchants monopolize the freight transportation on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line and the Shanghai-Xiamen line. Chinese merchant shipping companies are therefore suffering significant losses.</p>

<p>After the Fujian coup, the China Merchants Bureau's Xinming ship operating on the Shanghai-Tianjin line, the Jiangyu and Jiangtian ships operating on the Shanghai-Hankou line, the Guangli ship operating on the Shanghai-Wenzhou line, and the Taishun ship operating on the Shanghai-Fuzhou line, a total of five ships, as well as the Ning Shao ship operating on the Shanghai-Hankou line, have all suspended their original routes due to busy transportation. As for the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo lines, in addition to the usual passenger services operating as usual, freight trains have also been reduced. Therefore, the freight transportation of both ships and trains has been affected.</p>

<p>The Executive Yuan issued an order to the Municipal Government to properly handle the relief of stagnant domestic wheat sales, stating, "The Secretariat of this Yuan forwarded public letters from the Nanjing Municipal Government and the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Finance, and the Rural Rehabilitation Committee, etc., regarding the investigation of stagnant sales of domestic products and ways to relieve the situation. Based on the reports of various investigation teams, as well as the reports investigated by the Ministry of Railways' telegraphs to various railways, and referring to the reports investigated by the Ministry of Industry's telegraphs to various construction and industrial departments, as well as customs trade statistics, the overall situation is divided into investigation items, reasons for stagnant sales, and suggested solutions for submission to the authorities for review, etc. After being submitted to the 132nd Yuan meeting, it was resolved to be sent to the National Economic Council for reference, and to be sent separately to the Rural Rehabilitation Committee and the relevant responsible or related agencies for separate verification and handling. With regard to the increase in taxes on imported foreign wheat and flour, the Legislative Yuan was consulted, and with regard to the second recommendation, the Ministry of Finance and the provincial governments should be instructed to implement it properly, and the Ministry of Industry should dispatch special commissioners to investigate and contact the provincial governments at any time. The Rural Rehabilitation Committee will also telegraph various provincial people's organizations to report on excessive taxes and levies, in addition to sending separate letters of inquiry and orders. This order is issued for compliance with instructions and reporting."</p>
<h3 id="e126">Gasoline and Other Dangerous Goods: Transportation Temporarily Not Accepted; Railway Ministry Instructs Railway Bureaus to Comply <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus received Instruction No. 7411 from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, which stated: "Upon investigation, gasoline is a highly flammable liquid with varying flash points, ranging from approximately 55 to 100 degrees Fahrenheit. Its hazardous nature is significant. Therefore, the Ministry's list of general goods includes gasoline in the classification table for explosive and dangerous goods, accompanied by detailed provisions for special packaging and marking. Furthermore, Article 40, Item 5, of the General Rules for Freight Car Responsible Transportation also stipulates that explosives and dangerous goods are not included in the categories for which responsible transportation is undertaken. Now, based on a letter from the Nanjing Mobil Oil Company to the Ministry's Freight Responsible Transportation Committee stating that the Jinpu Railway does not handle responsible transportation for gasoline, while the Pinghan and Zhengtai Railways require billing as responsible goods and charge an additional 10% for freight, which seems inconsistent with the regulations, it is proposed to explicitly stipulate that gasoline is not subject to responsible transportation and to issue a notice to all railways to comply."</p>
<p>The approval from the North likely stems from the provisions of Article 40, Item 5, of the General Rules for Freight Car Responsible Transportation, which allows responsible transportation for kerosene and oil products. However, gasoline and kerosene originate from the same source, petroleum. Furthermore, the term "oil products" originally refers to various oily substances listed in Categories E, 7th, 8th, and 29th of the Classification Table for Explosive and Dangerous Goods. Therefore, the Pinghan and Zhengtai Railways may have mistakenly assumed that gasoline can be treated like kerosene or as oil products subject to responsible transportation. To resolve this misunderstanding and prevent divergent practices, the railways should temporarily cease handling responsible transportation for dangerous goods such as gasoline, motor spirit, and benzine, and no responsible fees should be collected. In addition to separate orders, you are hereby instructed to comply with this order." The bureau has already forwarded this instruction to the Traffic Department for compliance.</p>

<p>The first shipment of American wheat has been jointly chartered by the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and Fearnley &amp; Eger. The chartered ships have arrived at Portland to commence loading. As of the 17th of this month, the ships were fully loaded with wheat, totaling over 7,000 tons, and directly set sail for Shanghai. The journey across the Pacific is expected to take 24 to 25 days. According to a telegram from the ship, it is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai no later than December 12th and is planned to berth at the Pudong China Merchants Warehouse for unloading.</p>
<p>Regarding unloading procedures, all matters concerning the arrival of American wheat in Shanghai will be handled by the China Merchants' Pudong Warehouse. To prevent any unforeseen damage, the office in charge of cotton and wheat transportation stationed in Shanghai is drafting open bidding procedures for various expenses such as cabin opening and warehousing. This process is currently underway, and a public announcement will be made once a decision is reached.</p>
<p>More American Cotton to Come: The second batch of American cotton is also being shipped by Fearnley &amp; Eger's vessels. One ship has already been fully loaded in New Orleans, with a quantity of over 10,000 bales. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai before the 15th of next month.</p>

<p>Xinsheng News reported that after the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company began handling national water and land intermodal transport, various private shipping companies strongly advocated for participation. Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, went to Beijing the night before to discuss the matter. The details are as follows:</p>

<p>After negotiations, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ministry of Railways reached an agreement on the general contract for national water and land intermodal transport. The draft contract has been signed by Yu Yan, Director of the Intermodal Transport Department, and Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, and has been approved by the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company and the Ministries of Transport and Railways, respectively. The formal contract is about to be signed. In response to the strong demands from various private shipping companies to join the intermodal transport, the Ministry of Railways telegraphed the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, requesting them to send representatives to Beijing to discuss the implementation plan. Liu Hongsheng, General Manager of the company, accompanied by Wu Delin from the Business Department, traveled to Beijing on the Shanghai-Nanjing overnight express train the night before.</p>

<p>Since the implementation of intermodal transport between the Longhai Railway and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company on the 20th of this month, the "Tonghua" ship loaded the first batch of intermodal transport cargo at the temporary wharf in Laoyao Sunjiashan, Haizhou, and returned to Shanghai at 3:00 AM the day before yesterday. Yesterday, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's radio station received a telegram from the "Tonghua" informing them that it is expected to arrive in Shanghai this morning, carrying 1,000 tons of cargo including peanuts, soybeans, melon seeds, and golden needles. The "Yushun" ship encountered dangerous winds and waves when it arrived at the temporary wharf in Laoyao Sunjiashan, making loading difficult, so the date of its return to Shanghai will inevitably be postponed. The Longhai Railway Administration has made great improvements to the temporary wharf in Sunjiashan to expedite intermodal transport.</p>

<p>Swire Shipping Company's South China route has a total of thirteen regular merchant ships operating from Shanghai. Since the Guangzhou seamen's strike, the company's Shanghai-Guangdong liners have suspended service for nearly half a year, resulting in significant business losses. This reporter learned about the resolution of the strike last Tuesday. However, it was not reported because the conditions had not yet been signed by both parties. The following details are provided regarding the company's resumption of the Shanghai-Guangdong service and discussions on post-strike matters with the Hakka community:</p>
<h3 id="e133">Compensation for Losses <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>It has been learned that the Swire Shipping Company and the Guangzhou Seamen's Union signed an agreement to resolve the strike, with the company agreeing to pay the Seamen's Union 179,000 silver dollars. This compensation is solely for the Seamen's Union and covers various living expenses incurred by dockworkers during the strike. Workers on the "Wusong" and "Foshan" ships will be re-employed, but they must comply with the company's established rules. The strike officially ended on the 25th.</p>
<h3 id="e134">Resumption of Guangdong Service <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The Guangzhou route, which had been suspended due to the strike, has caused immeasurable business losses for the company's thirteen vessels on the South China line for nearly half a year. Upon receiving notification of the strike's resolution, the Shanghai office immediately resumed the Shanghai-Guangdong route. The Guangzhou warehouses reopened yesterday, and dockworkers and barges resumed work as usual. Therefore, the Shanghai office ordered the "Xinjiang" to depart today on the first resumed Guangzhou service, carrying over 2,200 pieces of miscellaneous goods loaded by the Shanghai Guangdong community. The "Jinan" and "Zhoushan" ships have also been scheduled to continue to Guangzhou in the coming days, and the Guangdong community has been notified to resume loading as usual.</p>

<p>During the strike, the most significant losses were incurred not only by the company but also by the Guangdong food, grain, medicinal material, and cotton cloth guilds. Goods had been locked in warehouses for a long time, preventing unloading, leading to economic stagnation and severe damage to the goods. Therefore, the merchants requested Swire Shipping to compensate for the losses incurred during the strike. Swire Shipping was unable to accept this request, so the grain guild convened a meeting at the Shenxiutang in this city the night before to discuss the matter. The decisions made on the spot were: (1) If Swire Shipping does not compensate the merchants' losses, the grain guild will not load Swire Shipping ships. (2) Any Guangdong goods transported by Swire Shipping ships will not be purchased. This intention has been telegraphed to various guilds in Guangdong. Anyone who privately loads goods with the company will be fined 5,000 to 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, the cotton cloth and silk guilds also joined the boycott and telegraphed various Guangdong communities in the Yangtze River ports, Qingdao, Tianjin, and other places for unified action. Therefore, the issue is very tense.</p>
<h3 id="e136">Chamber of Commerce Appeals on Behalf of Sanyou Industrial Company; Crippling Industry Will Inevitably Lead to More Unemployment <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce sent telegrams to the Executive Yuan, Judicial Yuan, Ministry of Industry, Shanghai District Court, and Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court of the National Government in Nanjing regarding the Sanyou Industrial Company's Yinxian Plant shutdown case, which has many practical difficulties after being ordered to be enforced by the court. Since its establishment, Sanyou Industrial Company has been engaged in the cotton weaving industry for more than 20 years. Unfortunately, its Yinxian Port Plant was destroyed by fire during the January 28 Incident in 1932, resulting in significant losses and making it impossible to reopen. At the request of the original workers, the case was submitted for arbitration, which has a mandatory nature. In terms of law, the effect of the arbitration is equivalent to a final judgment of the court, and there should be no room for change even if recourse is sought from the court. All three trials were rejected. However, the content of the arbitration reportedly requires the company to resume part of its operations within three months, with a minimum capacity to accommodate one-fifth of the original workforce. Before resuming operations, the company must pay the workers a pro-rata living allowance based on their original salaries. This decision is difficult to implement. First, capital is needed to start operations. Second, even if operations are started, operating at only one-fifth capacity is considered impermissible by those with factory management experience. Without capital to start operations, the one-fifth of workers must be maintained indefinitely with living expenses, even until old age. Even with common sense, it is known that this is not possible. The credibility of the law must be upheld, but it is also difficult to implement in practice. Therefore, those responsible for nurturing the people, protecting their livelihoods, and managing the national economy cannot stand idly by. Fortunately, most of the one-fifth of workers have voluntarily abandoned the rights stipulated in the arbitration, so the method of mediation does not require other solutions. It is only necessary to extend this to the entire one-fifth of workers with the same will. The arbitration also states that the remaining workers may be dismissed according to the original agreement, but when the Shanghai and Hangzhou plants hire new workers, they should give priority to hiring the dismissed workers. From a practical perspective, the company's Shanghai plant lacks capital and cannot start operations, and the Hangzhou plant is also owned by the company, so expansion is not easy. Therefore, the above proviso can be considered a formality in practice. Thus, the only means of executing the arbitration is dismissal. The arbitration states that the conditions of dismissal should be in accordance with the original agreement, so the provisions of the original agreement must be fully understood, and it is difficult to take them out of context. The agreement has an addendum stating that all articles must comply with the government's promulgated regulations, and if the government modifies them in the future, they must still be implemented according to the modifications. Therefore, since the implementation of the Factory Law and the abolition of the Shanghai Special Municipality's Workers' Retirement Treatment Method, the provisions for executing the arbitration dismissal should be based on the Factory Law. The purpose of the execution of the Factory Law should be to simplify things. The targets that the court should give to the dismissed workers are not problematic, and the court should base the method of calculating these targets on the overall consistent spirit of the Factory Law. Even for the sake of prudence, it should be submitted for interpretation once, or at least be determined by a trial judgment before being executed. If the number of these target properties and the content of the arbitration are clearly stated, then Sanyou Company would have no right to claim or litigate according to the law. However, in fact, it is not. Without removing the facts in dispute, the court hastily issued an order stating that from the day after receipt, the Yinxian Port Factory should resume part of its operations within 20 days, based on the notice to select workers to report to the factory on time, and entrusted the Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Court to assist in the execution, ordering the company to pay more than 75,000 yuan according to the amount opened by the workers within 10 days, otherwise, the factory would be seized and auctioned for compensation. The maintenance of the credibility of the factory opening arbitration has room for mediation, but the credibility of a court order cannot be fully achieved. The severance pay in dispute has not yet been determined by trial judgment, and the court hastily executed it without considering the company's financial capacity to bear it or whether it contains prevarication, and only based on one party's claim, without trial judgment, which is not considered in the interpretation of the law. In short, national laws are originally intended to protect the interests of the people. If only the employer is protected, the employees, although harmful, can still survive. Conversely, if only the employees are protected, the employer, although harmful, how can the employees survive? Who does not sympathize with the unemployment of the Yinxian Port workers? Therefore, the legal provisions and interpretations may not be appropriate. If the Sanyou Industrial Company is sealed and auctioned, all of the company's operations will be shut down, and the number of unemployed workers will increase even more. The credibility of the court will be compromised, and the original intention of the law to protect the interests of the people will be fundamentally eliminated, which will have a significant impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood, directly and indirectly. Our association dare not remain silent. We hereby submit this telegram to your government's Executive Yuan and Ministry for review, (1) to find a way to make all one-fifth of the workers abandon the rights to restore the ministry permitted by arbitration, (2) the relevant court should legally try the decision of the Shanghai Special Municipality Labor-Capital Mediation Committee on March 14, 1929, and the subject of the dismissal grant in dispute, begging you to consider the fact that our country's industry cannot be crippled again, so that the number of unemployed people will increase even more, and the national economy and the people's livelihood will be fortunate, Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, feels deeply grateful for the telegram.

<h3 id="e137">The Two Railways Promote Domestic Tobacco; Reduced Freight for Lanzhou Water Tobacco; Hemp Packaging Charged at Third-Class Rate <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>The Two Railways Administration previously stipulated by the Ministry of Railways that boxed tobacco leaves should be charged at the second-class rate, and packaged tobacco leaves should be charged at the third-class rate. The North Ning Railway and other railways have generally charged the second-class freight rate for Lanzhou water tobacco due to its being boxed. The tobacco merchants complained that they could not afford the burden and requested a reduction or exemption. The Ministry of Railways then instructed the railways to investigate the packaging method of the water tobacco and whether it was charged at the third-class rate. The bureau now reports that, after investigation by the Business Department, Lanzhou water tobacco is a thick tobacco produced in Lanzhou, transported to Shanghai in boxes. Although the tobacco is coarsely processed, it is still raw goods, and most of the shippers are merchants who sell it. Each batch is only 300-400 kilograms and is packaged with hemp, so it is charged at the third-class rate according to the Ministry's regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e138">Sharp Drop in Cotton Yarn Prices; The Future Crisis of the Yarn Industry Intensifies; The Yarn Association to Hold Emergency Meeting Tomorrow to Discuss Measures to Save the Current Situation <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Xinsheng News reported that after the Chinese Cotton Mill Association reduced its work hours, there was still a large amount of yarn in stock, and sales remained sluggish. The crisis in the yarn industry has not been reversed. Therefore, in order to jointly discuss ways to save the decline, it has been decided to convene a meeting of representatives from cotton mills across the country tomorrow afternoon to discuss the matter. Since the Fujian Incident, yarn sales have further decreased, and yesterday's market price drop was very severe, unprecedented. The findings are divided into the following sections:</p>
<p>General Meeting Tomorrow; In view of the intensifying crisis of the yarn industry and the urgent need to save itself, the Executive Committee of the Yarn Association decided a week ago to notify cotton mills across the country that an emergency meeting of cotton mills across the country would be held in Shanghai on the 29th and 30th to discuss rescue measures. Factories were requested to send representatives to Shanghai to participate in the deliberations. Representatives from various places have been arriving in Shanghai one after another since yesterday and are scheduled to hold a meeting at the Yarn Association at 2:00 PM tomorrow, and continue the discussion on the 30th.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Plummets Yesterday; According to a person in charge of the yarn exchange yesterday, the Chinese yarn market has been in a downturn since the "September 18 Incident," and the phenomenon has been deepening in recent days. The North China cotton yarn market has been gradually seized by the Japanese, and the Yangtze River area has suffered from natural and man-made disasters. The only areas that can be active are the Guangdong and Shantou Xiamen regions. Now that the Fujian Incident has occurred, once the situation expands, it will inevitably affect Guangxi and Guangdong, so the crisis will intensify. In recent months, the daily trading volume has been at most 400-500 bales, and in recent days, it has only been around 300 bales. Today (the 27th), the near-term and long-term market has been declining very sharply. The near-term November last price yesterday (the 26th) and today's (the 27th) final settlement fell to six yuan and nine jiao, and December also fell four yuan and eight jiao. The futures prices for January, February, March, and April all fell by two yuan and three jiao. As for the reason for the sharp drop, on the one hand, it was affected by the current situation. At the same time, in order to stabilize cotton yarn prices, the Cotton Industry Control Association sent people to take in more than 10,000 bales on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday of last week, so the near-term market price rose to 188 yuan, which was 6 yuan higher than before the purchase. Unexpectedly, today, 5,000 bales were suddenly released, causing panic in the market, and the decline was also straight down. It is said that there are currently more than 100,000 bales in stock in various factories.</p>

<p>The Municipal Government established the Slaughterhouse Improvement Expense Management Committee to improve slaughtering. The annual income is only around 30,000 yuan. Recently, merchants from the slaughtering industry have transferred these funds to the Aviation Association for the purchase of aircraft. The committee has nothing to do, so all members of the committee have repeatedly submitted their resignations. The Municipal Government has instructed the Finance Bureau to take over. The original text of the Municipal Government's order to the Finance Bureau is as follows: "According to the report submitted by Huang Yexin, Chairman of the Municipal Slaughterhouse Improvement Expense Management Committee, and all members of the committee, the members have been entrusted by the Municipal Government, and have served as members of the committee for two years. All income and expenditure have been approved by the Municipal Government in advance, and verified afterward. However, due to the large number of colleagues and diverse opinions, it is difficult to handle. Now, these funds are to be expanded for use by the Aviation Association for the purchase of aircraft. The committee has nothing to do, and the members should submit their resignations as a whole." (Three more submissions, the original text is roughly the same, omitted) Based on this, in addition to the instructions, all submissions are known. The Municipal Government approves the resignation request of all members of the committee and orders the Finance Bureau to take over and report the handover situation. This order is issued in addition to being printed and sent. The Bureau must immediately comply and report on the progress of the takeover. This order.</p>

<p>Recently, there is a lack of air in Nanyang (Southeast Asia), and there are many Hainanese Overseas Chinese who have lost their jobs and returned to the country. Some wealthy merchants still bring back some residual capital, hoping to invest in industries in their hometown to solve future problems. For ordinary workers, there are still many unemployed after returning home, and they are very dependent on government relief. Those in Qiongshan rely on the support of relatives and friends, and many of them are engaged in growing sugarcane and producing sugar to maintain their clothing and food. Since Qiongzhou Customs detained export of native sugar, merchants have been wary and dare not sell native white sugar for export, causing sugarcane farmers to be unable to sell sugar after it is produced, and they are unemployed. The situation for Overseas Chinese is very difficult. Even Overseas Chinese businessmen who want to invest in the sugar industry are very wary of this. Therefore, the Hainan sugar merchants sent a representative, Xing Juefei, to the north to ask the authorities for instructions and took a petition to the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission to meet with Chairman Chen Shuren to describe the suffering of the Hainanese Overseas Chinese who have lost their jobs, hoping to provide assistance. Chen agreed to ask the Ministry of Finance and Industry to resolve the problem quickly, and planned to provide relief to the entire area. Please ask the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds, and the Association will send people to investigate barren land in various provinces in advance to prepare for the future resettlement of Overseas Chinese, so that they can all engage in agriculture.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association wrote to the Director-General of the Public Works Department of the Shanghai International Settlement yesterday, stating: "We are writing to you regarding the letter from taxpayer Dai Shengding, which states that the Donation Department of the Shanghai International Settlement Public Works Department forcibly assessed high rents and coerced harsh taxes for his residence. Your association has already protested to the bureau, and he is awaiting a resolution. The Public Works Department's Donation Department ignored this, and suddenly sent donation collectors to his residence this morning. They went even further, removing their official status and relying on barbarism to shout and coerce 12 yuan and 6 jiao. They refused to stop until they succeeded. If he tried to reason with them, they threatened to harm his family. His family could not bear the harassment and could hardly live. This situation is disruptive and disorderly. If the household did not comply, they could resort to the courts in order to maintain the dignity of the public institution, and to avoid public unrest. The petitioner has no choice but to beg you to immediately and urgently protest to the Public Works Department, and to protect security and maintain life, and will be extremely grateful." The association is again writing to your department to stop the illegal actions of the donation collectors and to avoid bringing shame on the rule of law.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Zhou Xiangxian Discusses the Recent Situation of the Yellow River Closure Project; The First and Third Districts Can Be Completed Within the Year; The Changyuan Breach is Currently Undergoing Diversion and River Dredging; Hope to Raise Cotton Clothing and Coal for Relief <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Xiangxian, Director of the Engineering Team of the Yellow River Flood Relief Association of the National Government, came to Shanghai from Nanjing on the 25th to handle important matters and went to Beijing last night. A reporter from Xinsheng News visited Zhou at the Association's office yesterday and inquired about the recent situation of the Yellow River closure project. Zhou's replies are divided into the following sections:</p>
<h3 id="e146">Changyuan Breach <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Zhou first said that the Yellow River breach closure project is divided into three districts. The first district, Henan Province, and the third district, Dongming County, Hebei Province, are both dry breaches (meaning there is no water at the breach), and the project is relatively easy to implement and can be completed within the year. The project in the second district, Changyuan County, with the 27th and 30th breaches, is very difficult to implement, and all efforts are being concentrated there. During the conversation, an aerial view of the Yellow River in Changyuan County, measured by the city's aircraft, showed that there was a lot of sediment accumulated at the turning point of the old riverbank south of the Changyuan County city. The water flowed straight north, forming two huge pools, and then rushed north to the Jin Causeway, forming the 27th and 30th breaches. The downstream river and the new river formed by the breach each formed a 90-degree angle, while the breach and the upstream river formed a straight line, which will inevitably change the course.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Closing the Channel and Opening the River <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>In order to close the mouth of the Jin Causeway, it is necessary to first cut off the water channels at the diversion point. There are four water channels. The first channel flows to the 27th breach, which has now been cut off. The second, third, and fourth channels flow to the 30th breach, and the second and fourth channels on both sides have now been blocked. Currently, efforts are being made to block the third channel in the middle. Some people say that the river is still horizontally overflowing and difficult to block, and that the slow progress of the project is not clear. In addition to cutting off the flow, two canals are also being dug in the newly flooded river channel turning point where sediment has accumulated, diverting the water from the two breaches, so that the sediment can be washed away.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Smooth Progress of Work <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Currently, there are over ten thousand workers in various districts engaged in disaster relief work. They are paid wages for digging and filling earth for several days. Approximately three thousand workers are working in Changyuan. Engineering technicians are mostly concentrated in the Fengbao area, east and west of the breach. The progress of work in each district is very smooth. However, the diversion project must be completed before the ground freezes, as work will be difficult and may come to a standstill after freezing. Moreover, after the spring thaw, the water level will rise, hindering the work. Therefore, the work in the area has become very urgent recently.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Donation and Transport of Cotton-Padded Clothing <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Furthermore, the disaster relief group of the association received a report from the Hebei Investigation and Relief Office stating that the office had raised 10,000 sets of cotton-padded clothing donated by the Beiping Xiao Hui School, as well as 1,000 sets of miscellaneous donations of cotton-padded clothing. In addition, General Zhu Ziqiao and others raised 500 tons of coal donated by the Zhongyuan Company for use by various weaving factories. The group immediately sent a letter to the Ministry of Railways requesting the Railway Bureau to promptly transport the relief supplies upon arrival at the station, recording the rice price as a precedent.</p>
<h3 id="e150">County Agricultural Education Center Actively Promotes Native Cloth Industry; Sales Greatly Reduced Due to Fujian Incident; Joint Research Association Formed by All Sectors <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Zhang, the curator of the Shanghai Hemp Farmers' Education Center, recognizing the dumping of foreign goods, the bankruptcy of the rural economy, and the gradual decline of the native cloth sideline industry, which farmers have historically relied upon for their livelihood, has vigorously advocated for it for several years. The latest development plan for the native cloth industry is detailed as follows:</p>
<p>Expansion of Factories The center, in conjunction with various sectors, has established two native cloth factories in Touqiao on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway. Since their establishment, they have been producing dozens of bolts of cloth daily, and dozens more are woven by contracted farmers. However, to improve the quality of the products, they will be expanded and new machines will be replaced, which is scheduled to begin next year.</p>
<p>Promotion of Sales The large quantities of native cloth produced by the factories are sold by the native cloth store on Fenghua Road. The store's business relies on schools making uniforms and people from all walks of life making purchases to sustain itself. However, since the entry of foreign goods, monthly sales have decreased. Also, many schools still do not use native cloth for uniforms, and the Fujian Incident has impacted major sales in Fujian and Guangdong. It is planned to discuss and decide on a plan to promote sales in order to seek relief.</p>
<p>Establishment of a Research Association To improve the quality of native cloth, the center plans to form a native cloth research association in conjunction with native cloth comrades from all sectors, to engage in design. Preparations have been completed, and the inaugural meeting will be held within the next month.</p>
<p>Spring Exhibition The center's native cloth exhibition has been held in Shanghai several times. This year's exhibition at the Municipal People's Education Center attracted attention from all sectors. It is planned to hold a large-scale native cloth movement next year, with the exhibition to be moved to Zhabei.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Reduced Imports of Artificial Silk <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, the sales of artificial silk have almost replaced natural silk. China's industry and commerce are lagging behind, and there are no domestic manufacturers yet, resulting in annual imports of more than 10 million taels. According to the recent four-year import statistics released by the International Trade Bureau, there is a gradual decline. The reasons are the daily drop in the price of raw silk and the increase in import tariffs on artificial silk. In terms of import volume, Italy ranks first, followed by Germany and Japan. In 1930, the total import was 127,091 dan, valued at 15,279,857 taels. In 1931, it was 133,491 dan, valued at 19,059,675 taels. In 1932, it was 103,388 dan, valued at 11,404,630 taels. From January to June this year, it was 46,234 dan, valued at 4,289,878 taels.</p>

<p>Regarding the execution case of Sanyou Society and the Seventh District Labor Union of the Cotton Weaving Industry for the dismissal of workers from the Sanyou Factory, the First Special District Court opened an execution court yesterday at 10:00 AM. The labor representative lawyer Wei Wenhan and the factory representative lawyers Tan Yigong and Zhang Shizhao attended. Representatives from the Nanjing Road Cloth Merchants Association also attended as observers. The execution magistrate announced in court that the court had received a letter from the Shanghai Local Court stating that the factory had filed an appeal in this case, and all files had been sent to the higher court for review and requested the court to temporarily suspend execution. It was also reported that the factory had calculated the dismissed workers' wages according to the Factory Law and submitted them to the Shanghai Local Court. Lawyer Wei stood up and stated that there was mediation underway outside the court that was very close to a resolution and requested a temporary suspension of execution. Lawyers Tan and Zhang stated that since the Shanghai Local Court had issued a letter requesting a suspension of execution, the factory had no objection, but requested a copy of the Shanghai Local Court's letter of entrustment for assistance in execution and the attached list of dismissed workers, as well as the amount of dismissed wages listed. The magistrate approved the copying.</p>

<p>The International Trade Bureau, in order to promote the sales of domestic fruits abroad, has repeatedly discussed methods with the local fruit industry. It has been decided to first try selling chestnuts, pears, ginkgo nuts, etc., to Liverpool, Southeast Asia, and other places this year, and to publish explanatory brochures to promote them. After this news spread, fruit industries in Liverpool and the Netherlands sent letters to the National Trade Bureau to inquire. However, since the local fruit industry was still in the preparation stage, there was no definite reply. Yesterday, Dutch Consul Gromen again sent a letter to the National Trade Bureau to inquire in detail about: (1) the types of fruits to be sold, (2) the provinces and regions where the fruits are produced, (3) the final loading point, (4) the time required for transportation, (5) the type of transportation, (6) whether the goods are handled by the exporter or the agent of the client, and (7) the location and style of packaging. After receiving the letter, the bureau's guidance department specialist Zhang Qingsun went to inquire with the Fruit Industry Association's committee Xie Maoheng's manager Zhu Qifeng. It is understood that the association has now raised several thousand yuan for expenses. Because it is currently the peak sales season for pears, chestnuts, ginkgo nuts, etc., it has been decided that the first batch will first pack one ton each of Shandong's goose pears, long-handled pears, Tianjin's Liangxiang chestnuts, Zhejiang's red chestnuts, and Jiangsu's ginkgo nuts for trial sales to Liverpool. However, because the explanatory brochure has not yet been printed, it cannot be loaded and shipped immediately. It is expected to be exported no later than the beginning of next month. The bureau immediately replied to the Dutch Consul according to the situation. As for the costs of fruit loading and shipping, according to Mr. Zhang, the freight from Shanghai to Liverpool, excluding import and export taxes in both places, also requires 120 yuan per ton.</p>

<p>The Songhu Garrison Headquarters, based on a tip, dispatched an investigation team on October 8 to crack down on a morphine manufacturing facility in the Liuhe countryside. The incident was reported in various newspapers. However, because the raid occurred at dawn, the main culprits were not at the factory. Only manufacturing workers Wang Agen, Bao Jitang, Chen Awu, Zhang Afu, and farmer Gu Fushi and others were apprehended. It is now learned that the Garrison Headquarters, considering that the suspects dared to set up a factory to manufacture drugs within the garrison area, which seriously disrupted public order, has not only strictly ordered the investigation team to apprehend and interrogate the main culprits within a time limit, but also released the arrested Gu Fushi and others after interrogation. In accordance with the Anti-Smoking Law, Wang Agen, Bao Jitang, Chen Awu, Zhang Afu, and other four persons were sentenced to imprisonment. The main text is recorded as follows: Wang Agen, Bao Jitang, Chen Awu, Chen Afu are all found guilty of manufacturing opium substitutes, each sentenced to five months of imprisonment and fined 300 yuan each. The number of days of detention before the judgment is determined shall be deducted from the term of imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day of imprisonment. If the fine cannot be paid, it shall be converted to imprisonment at a rate of one yuan per day. The raw materials and manufacturing equipment for opium substitutes, as well as transportation vehicles, shall be confiscated according to the list. The remaining perpetrators will be sentenced separately upon arrest. Gu Fushi, Yin Amo, Zhang Abao, and Wang Youwei are all found not guilty.</p>

<p>Morrison, an employee of the Soviet Aid Association, encountered obstacles in completing a certain political mission entrusted to him by his government and feared being reprimanded upon his return to his country. He suddenly abandoned his post and fled in May of this year. After Morrison disappeared, the chairman of the association, Mackev, discovered that Morrison had stolen a large sum of money from the association. In addition to filing a lawsuit with the First Special District Court, he also ordered five or six male and female Russian employees under his command, including Yazhimen, to rush to Morrison's residence, arbitrarily search it, and detain Morrison's wife. Later, Morrison was in Hankou.</p>

<p>Tang Jiapeng, also known as A Yu, the former manager of Rongji at the Great World, from Ningbo, was shot and killed in front of the Great World at around 2:00 AM on June 18 of this year. The case was investigated by the special agency inspector Jin Jiulin and the patrol detectives of the French Concession, who successively arrested the assassins Zhang Tinggui, also known as Xiao Sizi (age 26), from Funing, and Zhao Guangfu (age 28), from Yangzhou, and sent them to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. As previously reported, the police have completed a detailed investigation. Yesterday at 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang Chaozuo presided over the criminal court and interrogated them. First, the police lawyer Fei Xizhen stated the investigation process, and Zhang Tinggui confessed that he had previously served in the Changzhou Garrison for about three months and then came to Shanghai to work as a rickshaw puller for seven years, living in the upstairs room of the overpass in Zhiheli, Hengfeng Road, Zhabei. On June 3 of this year, while I was pulling a rickshaw passing by the New Bridge, I met</p>
<h3 id="e159">Old Acquaintance Wang Jinkui <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>He asked me to go to Room 208 of the Asia Hotel at 135 Avenue Edward VII at 8:00 AM the next morning to discuss something. When I went there, Wang said to me that a friend of his had a feud with Tang A Yu, the manager of the Great World, and wanted to kill him. He asked me to find two people to help, and promised to give me a reward of 400 yuan. I agreed and went home. That afternoon, I went to the Hengfeng Road stove shop to find Zhou Er, a carpenter from my hometown who also pulled a rickshaw. After meeting, I told Zhou what Wang had said, and Zhou immediately agreed and said that he had a good friend, Zhao Guangfu, who is now in court. At 10:00 AM on the 5th, I went to the Asia Hotel again to report to Wang. At that time, there were five or six people in the room that I did not recognize. Wang asked me to wait at the corner of Avenue Edward VII and Rue Belles at 11:00 PM the next night, and then took me to Tang's residence on Rue Luzon</p>

<p>He inspected it once and instructed me to go to the entrance of Wufuli at 12:00 to scout Tang's return time in preparation for attacking him there, and gave me 12 yuan for expenses. At noon on the 7th, I met Gu Dunyang, a rickshaw puller from my hometown, at the intersection of Hengfeng Road and Chang'an Road in Zhabei. I told him about this matter and invited him to participate. Gu also agreed and asked Gu to gather at my home in the evening. At about 1:00 AM, I went with Gu to the entrance of Wufuli on Rue Luzon to scout Tang's whereabouts. I did not see him for three consecutive nights. Later, Wang Jinkui asked to scout at the entrance of the Great World every night at 12:00, so I went with Gu. Wang pointed out Tang's appearance from the side. After going for three consecutive days, I saw Tang going home by car at about 1:00 every night. I immediately told Wang. Wang asked us to go to the Asia Hotel to</p>

<p>Later, at 9:00 AM on June 15, I met Zhao Guangfu through Zhou Er's introduction at the Hengfeng Road tea house. Gu Dunyang was also present, and we agreed that Zhao and Gu would be responsible for killing Tang. I went to Wang's place every day to get three yuan for food. At 12:00 on the night of the 16th, I met Wang under the big clock opposite the Great World. At that time, Wang's accomplice, Sun Er, brought two pistols and distributed them to Zhao and Gu. We waited until after 12:00, but Tang was not seen. We returned the pistols to Sun Er and agreed to meet at the tea house at the corner of Longmen Road at 10:00 the next night. When the time came, I went to the Great World at 11:00. Sun Er still brought the pistols and handed them to Zhao and Gu. I stood at the entrance of the Great World as a lookout. Wang Jinkui and his friend Li Buwu stood opposite the Great World to watch. At about 1:00, Tang A Yu came out of the Great World and got into the car. Just as he was about to drive away, Zhao and Gu rushed up and aimed at the car. Zhao fired six shots and Gu fired three shots. When we saw that the purpose had been achieved, we fled to a tea house on Rue Beke that had been arranged in advance.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Wang Jinkui Was Already There <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>I returned one pistol, but Zhao did not arrive. Wang asked to meet again at the tea house the next morning. At that time, Wang paid 350 yuan, saying that because Zhao had not returned the pistol, 50 yuan was deducted. At 4:00 that afternoon, I invited Zhou Er to my home to distribute the money. Zhou received 85 yuan, Gu received 150 yuan, Sun Er received 40 yuan, and I received 60 yuan. I fled. Later, on October 27, I was arrested in Room 648, Haifang Road, and so on. Zhao Guangfu confessed that he lived in a thatched shed on Pu Road and had been in Shanghai for six years as a carpenter. At 2:00 PM on June 14 of this year, my old acquaintance Zhou Er came to my house and said that someone had asked him to kill Tang Jiapeng and invited me to participate. He promised to give me a reward after the matter was completed. I agreed and asked me to go to the Hengfeng Road tea house at 8:00 AM the next morning to talk. When the time came, I went and Zhou introduced me to Gu Jiaoyang and Zhang Xiaosizi, who are now in court. We</p>

<p>Zhao and Gu Dunyang took responsibility for shooting Tang. On the 16th night at 11:00, I went to the front of the Great World to meet Xiaosizi as Zhou instructed. I also saw a rickshaw pull up to the clock on the opposite side, took out a pistol and handed it to me and Gu to hold. We waited at the entrance of the Great World until after 2:00, but we did not see Tang. We returned the gun to the rickshaw puller and agreed to meet at the tea house at the corner of Longmen Road at 10:00 the next night. On the 17th night, I went as agreed. At 11:00, we arrived at the front of the Great World together. Before long, Sun Er still brought the gun and handed it to me and Gu to each hold one. We waited until after 1:00 and saw Tang coming out. Just as he was about to get into the car, Gu rushed close and fired six shots. I also stepped forward and fired three shots. The pedestrian who was killed was actually injured by stray bullets. After achieving our goal, we fled. The next morning, I went to Zhou Er to ask for a reward. Zhou said that I had to return the gun to get the reward. I refused and never saw Zhou again. On the 24th of the same month at 8:00 PM, I led people with guns and robbed them on Gordon Road. I was arrested by detectives and sentenced to three and a half years. Now I have been transferred to the case. The interrogation has come to a close, and the court has announced that it will be retried on December 4. The defendants will be returned to custody separately.</p>
<p>Upon learning of the indictment, he rushed back to Shanghai to turn himself in. After being acquitted, he also filed a lawsuit against Mackev and others for robbery, claiming that there were 11,175 US dollars, 722 British pounds, a bank passbook, and a check in his residence, all of which were robbed. Mackev and others denied it completely, so they filed a counterclaim against Morrison for false accusation. After repeated trials and investigations by the First Special District Court, it was ruled that both parties were innocent. The detailed process has been reported in previous newspapers. However, Morrison was not satisfied with the first-instance judgment and still hired a lawyer to appeal to the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, stating various reasons and requesting that the original judgment be abandoned and that the defendants be punished according to law. Yesterday morning, the Second Branch of the High Court specially opened an investigation court to summon both parties for investigation. Mackev and others also hired lawyers to appear in court to defend themselves. Accordingly, both sides presented evidence and stated the facts of the case separately, and their words were mostly the same as in the first instance. The court then stated that the circumstances of the case were complicated and ordered an adjournment for further hearing.</p>

<p>Zhu Baoyuan, the owner of Zhenhe Tea Shop from Haining, passed away in April of this year, leaving an inheritance of more than 2.7 million, which was entirely controlled by his two sons, Zhu Yanqing and Zhu Shunqing. Initially, they refused to give any share to his two daughters who had married, Zhu Jun and others, and his stepmother and younger sister. When Zhu Jun and others filed a lawsuit, they were persuaded to mediate and each received 80,000 yuan. Because Zhu Jun and others' husbands were wealthy, they did not push the matter further and accepted the settlement conditions and withdrew the lawsuit. His stepmother, Ms. Xi, recently complained to the First Special Court through lawyer Chen Ying that Yanqing and others not only did not give her a share of the inheritance, but also stopped paying her monthly living expenses, which was disrespectful to elders. She accused the two sons of seizing the inheritance. However, since the first court session last month to resolve the issue of litigation costs, there has been no news. There are rumors that the case has been settled peacefully. Yesterday, I met the plaintiff's lawyer, who said that the plaintiff had repeatedly requested to check the accounts to understand the types and amounts of property, but the two defendants repeatedly delayed and did not disclose the accounts, so reconciliation was not easy. They can only wait for the court to adjudicate.</p>

<p>Guangdong Brothers Rubber Factory, located at No. 470 Peikai'er Road, specializes in manufacturing rubber overshoes, running shoes, and other products, so the factory is quite large and employs hundreds of workers. However, at approximately 5:25 PM yesterday, the Yangshupu Fire Department suddenly received a telephone report from the outside claiming that a fire had broken out inside the factory and requested assistance. Upon receiving the report, the fire department immediately dispatched several fire trucks to Peikai'er Road. When they arrived at the factory gate, the firefighters rushed into the factory to check and inquire about where the fire had broken out. At that time, the workers were working. Upon hearing this, fearing disaster, they were greatly disturbed and desperately rushed out. However, there were too many people and the door was too narrow, so they were blocked. Pushing and shoving, more than ten weak workers were pushed to the ground and trampled, crying out in alarm, and the order was in chaos. Fortunately, the firefighters and factory personnel had already checked all the places and found no fire. They immediately reported to the workers, and order was restored. However, the workers who were trampled were too seriously injured to stand up and were rescued by</p>

<p>Residents near the old Xidu Pier in the northern part of Yangjing Town, Pudong, have recently petitioned the Pudong Fellow Association to negotiate earnestly about the closure of the pier by the British-owned Asiatic Petroleum Company in order to facilitate transportation. The petition states: "We have learned that the issue of the municipal ferry moving the Xidu Pier, which hinders the transportation and water access of residents, has been repeatedly appealed to your association by fair-minded people near the ferry crossing to request assistance. The Asiatic Petroleum Company ignores the public opinion of the people and implements coercive measures in the style of imperialism, hiring workers to forcibly close the old Xidu Pier. The people were filled with hatred and wanted to prevent any future damage. The municipal authorities are planning to build a public pier next to the new ferry crossing in Xidu to provide water and goods for the public, but what is gained is not yet complete, and what is lost comes first. It should be known that the distance between the old pier and the new pier is not short. If a new road is not built between the old pier and the Hefeng Factory, the distance from the new pier eastward to the Meifu Pier ferry is six miles. Businesses located at the old pier must travel back and forth, exhausted. Therefore, even if the public pier is built, it will only benefit ferry transportation, but what method will be used to relieve the inconvenience of land transportation? The representatives, entrusted by all residents near the old Xidu Pier, dare to submit a petition humbly requesting your association to approve and respect public opinion and to negotiate with the municipal authorities on reasonable grounds. In addition to the municipal authorities building a public pier next to the new ferry crossing in Xidu, a new road must be built between the old Xidu Pier and the Hefeng Factory to facilitate transportation and benefit industry and commerce."

<p>On the night of the 10th of this month, a well-organized assassination occurred in Nanchang, the capital of Jiangxi Province. The victim was Zhang Tan, the local "King of the Terrace Foundation." After an investigation by the military and police, Wu Zuyin, a wealthy merchant in Jiangxi, was suspected. Because Wu had come to Shanghai, the director of the Public Security Bureau, Zhang Shouchun, tracked him to Shanghai and, together with police detectives, arrested Wu in Room 229 of the Yangtze Hotel and detained him in the First Special District Court pending investigation. As previously reported, after hearing the news of Wu's arrest in Shanghai, the prosecutor's office of the Nanchang District Court prepared a document requesting the First Special Court to hand over Wu Zuyin to Director Zhang Shouchun for interrogation in Jiangxi. Yesterday morning, Presiding Judge Qian Hongye brought Wu to court. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that since the Jiangxi Provincial Court had sent a document requesting the transfer, the police had no objection and requested the presiding judge to handle the matter according to law. Wu's lawyer wanted to make a favorable defense for Wu. Presiding Judge Qian stated that since a formal court had requested the transfer, it should be approved and there was no need to present any further evidence. Then, Wu Zuyin was handed over to Director Zhang of the Public Security Bureau in court to be taken to Nanchang for trial.</p>

<p>The wife of a Mr. Hong, a villager living near the Hujiazhai Bridge in Gaolang, became pregnant for seven or eight months. Suddenly, a few days ago, the fetus could not be delivered. The midwife was at a loss. Then, female doctors Qian and Yuan from the Hongkou People's Obstetrics Hospital diagnosed that she was having twins and that it was a difficult birth. Because the house was small and lacked electricity, making surgery inconvenient, she was sent to the hospital for surgery, and a deformed monster with two heads and four arms was removed. The family considered it unlucky, and the doctors lamented that it was rare. It is believed that the woman was carrying twins, but due to congenital insufficiency and incomplete development, the two bodies merged into one. The specimen of the monster child is still on display in the new hospital address behind the Tilanqiao Police Station for physiological researchers.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhu Chengye, an editor at the Correspondence School of the National Electrical Industries Association, departed for England on the 27th of this month to study. The association and its Zhejiang Provincial Branch, including Li Yanshi, Shen Sifang, Ye Yangwu, and Gao Shu'an, believe that Mr. Zhu's trip to England is specifically for studying the manufacture of electrical products so that he can apply his knowledge after returning to the country and contribute to the association. They hold boundless expectations and hosted a farewell banquet for Mr. Zhu at the Xinya Restaurant last night to wish him well. More than one hundred attendees included members of the association, representatives from domestic goods manufacturers, and guests from various circles. During the banquet, Mr. Li, Mr. Zhu, and others gave speeches to each other, and then took a photograph to commemorate the occasion. It is said that the Electrical Industries Association has also entrusted Mr. Zhu to investigate the latest developments in British power plants after his arrival in England and report back to the association for reference.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from the Jiangjiu (soy sauce wine) Guild stating that the tax exemption period for stored wine had expired, and the tax bureau was about to conduct inspections, causing difficulties. They requested a telegram to the Ministry of Finance to exempt tax payments and refunds, etc. The Ministry of Finance replied, "Received the telegram. Regarding this case, the Ministry's Tax Affairs Department received a telegram from the Joint Association of Shanghai, Ningbo, and Jiangsu Wine Industries, relaying the same request from the Soy Sauce Wine Industry Guild. The Tax Affairs Department considered that tax payment and refunds for wine stored before the implementation of the new regulations were intended to clearly delineate boundaries and facilitate verification. Those that have already been opened, mixed, and sold in bulk are naturally exempt from tax payment. However, for those stored or sold in whole jars or transported, how can new and old be distinguished without tax-paid certificates? Therefore, tax payment and refunds should be uniformly applied according to the regulations to ensure consistency and avoid disputes. The department instructed the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau to thoroughly inform the association and instruct all merchants to comply. All provinces are now following this procedure. How can Shanghai be an exception? In summary, the tax payment and refund for stored wine must be handled accordingly. If there are indeed difficulties in the procedures, the soy sauce wine merchants should report to the Tax Affairs Department and the Jiangsu Stamp Tax and Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau the total number of bottled wine, that has been bottled that paid old taxes in Shanghai that has not been sold, the number with public sale permits, and the number without permits, and the amount planned to be transported to other ports and the amount planned to be sold in this city. This is to determine the tax payment and refund methods for the benefit of both tax authorities and merchants. The request for exemption from tax payment and refund should not be discussed. You must immediately inform the guild to comply and avoid further delays. This is of utmost importance." This is the reply.</p>

<p>The rickshaw company opened by Mao Guibao, a native of Taizhou, at No. 20 Haiyu Lane, Ouyang Road, Zhabei, was robbed at 7:40 the day before yesterday. Six robbers, speaking with a Jiangbei accent, wearing blue cloth short shirts and trousers and black long robes, held three pistols. One robber acted as a lookout, while the other five broke into the rickshaw company and threatened the owners and others to remain silent. They were robbed of more than 1,000 small silver coins and clothing. After the robbery, they fled north towards the target range of the park.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Telephone Bureau Responds to Wu Song District Municipal Committee Regarding Plans to Improve Telephone Service, but Time Is Needed <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The Qihai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications replied to the Wu Song District Municipal Committee, stating: "Received your letter of November 23, stating that the telephones are dilapidated and waiting is required to speak with Shanghai. You requested that five more pairs of telephone lines be added between Song and Shanghai in the shortest possible time, and that all the old telephones currently in use be replaced with automatic ones. This is approved. Before January 28, the telephone in your town was originally commercially run and was an old magnet-type machine. Later, it was damaged in the war, and no one was running it. Our bureau took over to facilitate transportation, using copper wires to connect to Zhabei and establishing a branch bureau in your location. To date, there are only thirty-two subscribers. It would be uneconomical to convert to automatic machines. However, our bureau is currently designing and installing a 300-line automatic machine in the new city center area, which may be extended to your town in the future. The existing telephones are magnet-type, and although the components are old, the sound seems clear. However, the existing lines are insufficient, and to call the concession telephones, you must go through Zhabei and then to Nanshi to transfer, so the routes along the way are all related. Our bureau is now expanding the Nanshi and Zhabei relay lines from thirty pairs to fifty pairs, which will be completed in about two weeks. However, the lines to the concession are limited. In the past, the Chinese area called the concession telephones an average of about 3,000 times a day. Since our bureau included the Chinese-concession call fee in the monthly rent, the number of Chinese calls to the concession has increased to 11,000 to 12,000, which is three times more than before the merger, resulting in congestion at the '0' manual switchboard and inability to answer calls in time. Although we have notified all subscribers not to abuse the concession telephones unless there is an emergency to avoid hindering the calls of other subscribers, it is still ineffective. To improve telephone service, we have already ordered an expansion of equipment costing more than 100,000 yuan, but it will not arrive until next spring. The relay lines between Jiangwan and Zhabei have already been purchased and are being installed. However, the telephone lines between Zhabei and Wusong are often cut and stolen, several times a month. This year, there have been more than fifty cases. Our bureau has repeatedly sent letters to the Public Security Bureau and offered rewards for the arrest, but it has not stopped. Our bureau's loss is a small matter, but it is very laborious to send workers back and forth for repairs. The obstruction of traffic and the impact on the sensitivity of telephone service is one aspect. Regarding the relay lines between Song and Shanghai, our bureau is reporting to the ministry to find ways to increase them, that is, to transfer them from Jiangwan. In response to the letter, we hereby send a reply for your information."</p>

Judging from the enthusiastic ticket sales in recent days, there will be a grand occasion at that time. The chief of publicity stated that the proceeds from the ticket sales, excluding all expenses, will be donated to the special fund for unemployment relief. The two performances donated to Chinese charitable organizations the day before yesterday were well-received by the citizens of this city. This unemployment performance is also expected to be generously supported. Tickets are sold at the circus's ticket office on Jing'an Temple Road and at the Moutrie Department Store on Nanjing Road. The ticket prices range from one yuan to five yuan. According to the current plan, tomorrow (Wednesday) is the last day for the circus's performance in Shanghai. However, many requests have been made to extend the departure, so the circus's performance may be extended for one day, which is also unknown. After that, they will depart for India. Also, at the beginning of each performance, the interior is heated with a stove, so it is very comfortable.</p>

It is scheduled to begin construction next spring and will be completed by the autumn of next year. A beautiful art village will be seen decorating the refined and secluded countryside. The society's pursuit of new village construction is to standardize living standards and rationalize consumption, not just to solve the housing problem. Therefore, in addition to the Rose Garden New Village, other new villages will continue to be built. The Rose New Village will have a total of fifty households, and most of them have been pre-ordered. The remaining households will be solicited publicly to show equal opportunities so that ordinary people can own a house with small financial resources. Also, the society's current office at No. 20 Museum Road is not sufficient and may be expanded.</p>

<p>In recent days, the weather has been dry, so fires have been frequent, especially in the Zhabei slum. A group of disaster victims are haggard and have nowhere to stay, which is pitiful. However, at 1:15 a.m. yesterday, a fire broke out again near Qiwu Road, West Baoxing Road, Zhabei. The houses there were all thatched, and the residents inside were all coolies and rickshaw pullers. Shen Chen, a native of Jiangbei, was a widow and lived there. She relied entirely on her own labor for her livelihood. After she fell asleep the night before, she forgot to turn off the kerosene lamp. During a turn, she knocked the lamp over, and the kerosene spilled on the straw, causing the fire to ignite. It immediately spread to the whole house. She woke up in a dream and realized that it was too late to save the situation, so she ran out and shouted for help. The neighbors nearby also woke up from their dreams and scrambled for their lives. The order was in chaos for a while. The fifth district's police station was reported and immediately dispatched police officers to suppress the situation. At the same time, they notified the Zhabei fire brigades to rush fire trucks to the scene to put out the fire. However, the wind was strong, and the flames were soaring, making it difficult to start for a while. At the same time, the fire spread rapidly, and the thatched houses around became fire pits. Later, after the firefighters bravely rescued the situation, the fire was slightly reduced at about 2:30 a.m. It was not until about 3:00 a.m. that all the fires were extinguished. After the investigation, a total of more than forty thatched houses were burned down. Shen Chen, the person who started the fire, was taken to the ninth district police station for questioning and temporarily detained for further investigation.</p>

For a time, the flames soared and could not be contained. The fire brigades from all sections received the news and rushed to rescue the situation. At this time, the fire had spread to the neighbors on the left and right. The firefighters tried to prevent the spread while vigorously spraying water. It was extinguished at about 6:00 a.m. After the investigation, it was found that one building at No. 13 and three buildings at Nos. 11, 12, and 14 on the left and right were destroyed, resulting in significant losses.</p>

<p>A fire broke out suddenly under the stairs of the Dongxin Barber Shop at the intersection of Zhenxin South Lane, Dongxin Bridge Street, Avenue Edward VII, in the French Concession, at 4:00 a.m. yesterday. The barbers woke up from their dreams and ran out the door naked. Later, because the fire was fierce, the stairs had already been burned. The old woman surnamed Qin (tenant) and a man living upstairs were unable to escape and had to jump out of the window along the street, resulting in serious injuries. The fire brigade heard the alarm and drove a belt car to rescue the situation. It took about half an hour to extinguish the fire. As a result, several houses, including the overpass in the alley and the Dongxing Shoe and Hat Shop at the north entrance, were burned. After the incident, in addition to sending detectives to send the injured to the hospital for treatment, the police also summoned the owner of the barber shop to the police station for questioning.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Counterfeit Coin Operation Broken Up on Republic Road <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Chen Alin, a 22-year-old Ningbo native and former cook living at No. 3 Xinyi Village, Pushi Road, in the French Concession, has been unemployed recently. On the evening of the 10th of this month, he bought a loaf of bread for one cent at the Speer's food store at No. 688 Avenue Joffre. Chen paid a dollar and the Russian gave him five 20-cent coins and a 10-cent paper note as change. Chen took advantage of the Russian's turning around to switch to the counterfeit coins he was carrying and told the Russian that the change was counterfeit and insisted on exchanging it. The Russian refused and called the police from No. 687 Avenue Joffre. The police arrested Chen and took him to the police station. Chen was nervous and threw the five 20-cent coins given to him by the Russian into an alley on the side of the road in an attempt to absolve himself of guilt. The police found four of them and took them to the police station. Later, Chen confessed that the counterfeit location was in the pavilion room at No. 551 Republic Road. Detective Liu Kunbao immediately took Chen to No. 551 Republic Road and arrested Gu Rongqing (33 years old), a native of Huzhou, and his concubine Du Chen (35 years old, native of Qingpu) on the third floor. They also seized three sets of the latest new Sun Yat-sen model and one set of the old Yuan Shikai model, one set of the 20-cent model, batteries, files, pliers, and other tools for manufacturing counterfeit coins, as well as counterfeit dollars (six new versions and four Yuan Shikai), seventy-six counterfeit 20-cent coins, and a piece of raw lead in the pavilion room on the second floor. They also arrested six men and women in total, including Cao Yixin (44 years old, native of Nanxun), Hu Baolang (35 years old, native of Chongming), and Zhang Linjiang (51 years old), and took them to the police station for interrogation and investigation by the Second Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Chaozuo continued the trial in Criminal Court One. First, Attorney Fei Xizhen of the police station explained the police investigation process and prosecuted the defendants for manufacturing and using counterfeit coins in accordance with Articles 211 and 212 of the Criminal Law. Then, the Russian Speer testified about Chen Alin's exchange. Gu Rongqing admitted that he had been making counterfeit coins for several months. Chen Cao Hu and Zhang confessed that they had been selling and using counterfeit coins. Du Chen confessed that she had known Gu for only a month and did not know about the counterfeit coin manufacturing. After verifying the confessions, the court ordered the defendants to be remanded in custody and scheduled a verdict for the 30th.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Plot to Defraud American Oranges Exposed <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>The Fusheng Fruit Shop at No. 8 Wuchang Road had twenty boxes of American oranges worth 160 yuan stored in the Maocheng Cold Storage Company's refrigerator at No. 40 Huangpu Road to prevent damage. Recently, Jiang Zhongming, an apprentice from Anhui, who had resigned from the same industry, learned of this and came up with an idea to forge a Fusheng letter and seal at an engraving shop. At 2:30 p.m. on the 25th of this month, he wrote a delivery note, stamped it, and hired Shen Sanbao, a rickshaw puller from Tongzhou, on Wusong Road to deliver the note to the company to pick up the goods. Lu Zhengsheng, the bookkeeper from Ningbo, noticed that the seal on the note did not match and called Li Qikang, the manager of the Fusheng Fruit Shop from Ningbo, and found out that there was no such thing. He detained the rickshaw puller Shen Sanbao and learned that a young man surnamed Jiang had hired him to wait near the Great World on Avenue Edward VII. After a while, Li Qikang, the agent of Fusheng, arrived with Detective Zhang Guisheng of the Hongkou police station. They loaded the 20 boxes of American oranges onto the car according to the note and asked Shen Sanbao to push them to a parking lot near the Great World. Jiang Zhongming arrived happily and was arrested by Detective Zhang and taken to the police station. He was sent to the Third Court of the First Special District Court yesterday morning. Attorney Zhang Tianyin of the police station stated the situation and said that the defendant claimed at the police station that the matter was instigated by Xu Abao, who was at large, and that he was told to transfer the American oranges to the Ximolu vegetable market for sale. The note was presented for inspection, followed by testimonies from Li Qikang, the head of the cold storage company, Lu Zhengfu, and the rickshaw puller Shen Sanbao. When questioned, the defendant gave vague answers. Judge Xiao Xiefen ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the trial to investigate and verify the matter.</p>

<p>The Shen Chang Fresh Meat Shop, located at No. 1252 Lujiabang Triangle Street, South City, is opened by Lin Caifa from Ningbo. It has been in business for several years and has a flourishing business. At about 10:00 a.m. yesterday, a customer came to the shop to buy several pounds of fresh pork. Li Axiao, a shop assistant, cut it, weighed it, and handed it to the customer. The customer felt that the pork he bought today was different from the pork Lin Caifa usually bought, and he complained that it was not worth the price. At first, he negotiated with Li Axiao for a long time, and even wanted to return it, saying that the pork was too expensive and demanding the money back. While the two were negotiating, Lin Caifa arrived and persuaded the customer. He also added a little fresh pork, and the customer was happy and left the shop. After the transaction was completed, Li was angry with Lin because the boss did not care about the shop assistant's face and only knew how to please the customer. So the two argued again. After people persuaded them, Li suddenly wanted to resign, and the conflict broke out again. Li was so angry that he slashed Lin's head with a meat cleaver. Lin was injured and fell to the ground with blood all over his head. Dong Shidong, the guard of the 24th post there, heard about it and rushed to the scene. He arrested Li Axiao and took him back to the first precinct, first station. Yi, the police chief, ordered Li Axiao to be interrogated and ordered him to be detained temporarily, pending investigation of Lin's injuries, so that he could be sent to the police station for interrogation. It is reported that Lin Caifa's injuries are serious and may be life-threatening.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Liang Shaojiu Industry Guild held its 16th executive committee meeting yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. The following matters were resolved: (1) The procedures for registering and renovating rejected alcohol are complicated, and transportation in this street is often mistakenly detained by the police. A summary was drafted and submitted to the Shangbao Branch for a request. However, there has been no practical approval to date. It is now decided that the previous four representatives will go to the inspection office on the 27th to discuss simplified methods. (2) To rectify the industry regulations, we should join the various alcohol industry groups and jointly submit a request to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to convene a temporary representative meeting of various industries in order to achieve it. The industry's account放賬should be sorted out first. For example, if someone owes money to Jia Hang for a long time, the guild should be notified and all members should be notified not to do business with them until they have paid off their debts in order to protect their capital and avoid indiscriminate 放賬. However, those who pay now are not subject to this rule. (3) Alcohol shops have permits, annual taxes, and permit taxes, so they only need to pay a retail license for tobacco and alcohol license taxes. Now, the tax collection office has repeatedly increased the taxes and harassed them. It is planned to submit a request to the competent authority for explanation to avoid duplication and ease the burden. At the same time, all businesses should be notified to exchange the receipts printed by the tax collection office for formal licenses as soon as possible to avoid being suspected of colluding when checked by other agencies and being punished for no reason.</p>

<p>China's construction industry has progressed from wood and stone to reinforced concrete. The composition of reinforced concrete depends entirely on yellow sand and gravel. Therefore, for solid construction, one must first seek firm yellow sand and gravel. The gravel produced by the Songjiang Hongcheng Crushed Stone Factory has been certified by the Engineering Bureau to be firm. Compared with other gravel that is manually mined, loose in texture, and contains mud, it is vastly different. General draftsmen, engineers, and construction companies who seek solid and perfect construction in large-scale projects will find that the factory's products can fulfill their wishes. ▲ Welfare Company Men's Winter Coats at Bargain Prices The Welfare Company on Nanjing Road and Sichuan Road is now entrusted by a certain bank to sell European-made, finely crafted winter coats.

Therefore, the prices are definitely less than 60% of the usual selling price. These coats are finely crafted, made of expensive materials, light, warm, and beautiful, and come in all sizes. The special prices are $18.50, $22.50, and $29.50 each. It is said that those who go to buy them are very crowded.</p>

Because of their exquisite art and beautiful looks, they have a reputation for being contemporary. Every performance draws crowds. In the summer, they travel with song and dance, their route being Tokyo, Japan, Shanghai, China, then south along the sea, from Siam to the East Indies, and then back to the United States. They have been performing in Tokyo for more than three months. According to reliable sources, they will arrive in Shanghai today and will perform at the New Light Theater in this city on the 30th. The program is very precious, and the songs and dances are all new works by famous artists, not the common tunes heard on the street. They will perform at the New Light Theater in this city, limited to one week due to travel arrangements. After the week is over, they will leave Shanghai. Moreover, because the songs and dances they perform require a lot of energy, they are inevitably tired. Therefore, they will only perform one show at 9:15 p.m. every evening.</p>

<p>On March 3rd of this year, Mr. Xu Beihong and his wife, Ms. Jiang Biwei, brought their works to France to prepare for the opening. However, due to a lack of funds, all progress was met with unlimited difficulties. Fortunately, Beiping Sino-French University wired two thousand yuan, and Minister Gu and his wife each donated one thousand yuan, which allowed them to barely arrange everything and keep their promise to the French, which was also a fortunate event.</p>
<p>The Baomu Art Museum is divided into two floors, the lower floor being too dark and the space being very narrow, while the upper floor is the opposite. Our Chinese art exhibition was held on the upper floor. The arrangement was divided into ancient and modern sections. The two rooms on the left were for very ancient paintings, the central room was for near-ancient paintings, and the three large rooms on the right were for contemporary paintings. There were a total of 180 contemporary paintings and calligraphy, by 71 artists, as mentioned earlier. Now, the situation of modern and ancient paintings is briefly described below:</p>
<p>The so-called near-ancient paintings are the works of Ren Bonian, Shen Nanpin, Yu Zhiding, Qian Zai, Zhang Xi'an, Ji Gu, and Xu Dazhang, brought to France by Mr. Xu Beihong, totaling eleven paintings, which were displayed in a special room as representatives of the transition of ancient and modern art. The ancient paintings were works from the Tang Dynasty to the late Ming Dynasty. This part was entirely managed by the French, so the works of the Qing Dynasty were also included, which was quite mixed.

<h3 id="e208">Reorganization of the Anhui Education Department <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>(Anhui News) The internal organization of the Anhui Education Department still follows the old system of the 17th year of the Republic of China, divided into three sections and a secretariat, with a property management office set up outside. The responsibilities of the sections and shares reorganized by the fourth share of the first section are completely divided by business category. Therefore, the first section is in charge of funding and appointments, regardless of the funding and appointments of middle schools and social education institutions. However, other matters of secondary schools and other matters of social education are handled by the second and third sections. Although there is a division of labor, there is ultimately a lack of connection. Now, the department plans to change the method and plans to use the enterprise as the standard for dividing sections. For example, if the second section is in charge of secondary education, then all funding, appointments, and other matters related to secondary education will be managed by the second section, and so on for the other sections. Whether this kind of organization is convenient to implement remains to be seen after implementation.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Education Association moved its office to the China Arts and Crafts Society on Rue Amiral de Mer, it has been quite inconvenient due to the remote location.

The new building has now been completed, and the Shanghai Bank will also move in to conduct business.

<h3 id="e214">Sports Jiangda Football: Jinan Defeated Central Yesterday 丨Two to Zero丨 A Small Disturbance Occurred in the First Half: Luo and Li Collided and Were Sent Off: Jinling Defeated Daxia Six to Zero <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 27th) In the Jiangda Football Championship, Jinan and Central played at Zhongda at 2:30 p.m. on the 27th, with Yu Jie as the referee. Jinan is the holder of the Jiangda football championship, and it was expected that Zhongda would not be its strong opponent. After the start of the game, Jinan's offensive was very fierce within 35 minutes. Zhongda took a defensive stance. Although dangerous balls were frequently seen in front of Zhongda's goal, they were able to turn danger into safety due to their effective resistance. Unexpectedly, while they were competing with each other, Li Disheng was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty. Jiang Lianggui was unable to defend, and Nandong opened the scoring. Not long after the restart, Li Disheng and Luo Taoguang kicked Li's chest with one foot because of mutual competition for the ball. Fortunately, Li changed his hand and held his thigh, like a wrestling match. Li pounced directly at Luo, and the audience shouted in unison. The order was in chaos. After a few minutes, the referee sent Li and Luo off the field together, and the game continued. At the end of the first half, Jinan led by one to zero. After the break, they changed sides to fight, and both sides had ten players on the field. Although the Jinan team drove all their troops to the front line to attack fiercely, the Central University's defense was even stronger. After a long stalemate, Xu Yahui shot a goal two minutes before the end of the game. The momentum was very weak. It happened that Jiang Lianggui was leaving the goal to catch the ball, and the ball rolled into the goal in a smooth way, so Jinan took the lead again by one to zero in the second half. As a result, Jinan defeated Central by two to zero.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Jinling Defeated Daxia Six to Zero <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Jinling played against Daxia at 3 p.m. on the 27th in Jinling, with Zhang Xinfu as the referee. Because of the previous day's battle with Zhongda, several players of Daxia were injured. They took a defensive stance when they came on the field, while Jinling was full of killing intent and attacked fiercely. Daxia repeatedly encountered difficulties, but they were all passed through by Guan Anqiu's goal efforts. However, about twenty minutes into the game, Daxia was penalized with a twelve-yard penalty, and Jinling's Liu Zuxiu kicked in a goal. The first half became a ratio of one to zero. After the break, they changed sides to fight. Jinling attacked even more fiercely due to the favorable wind. Therefore, Chen Shangkai and He Xueyao each scored a goal one after another. After that, Daxia had no fighting spirit, and He Xueyao and Lin Xue each kicked in to the ball. The next half became a ratio of five to zero. As a result, Jin Lu defeated Daxia by six to zero.</p>

<h3 id="e217">The Chinese Team in the International Race Walking Event Abandoned Team Participation: Only Ten Individuals Will Participate This Year 丨Resolved by the Race Walking Committee Yesterday丨 <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Race Walking Association held a committee meeting at Murhall last night. Six committee members, including Shi Youhui, Yu Zichen, Zhou Yuyu, Zhang Zaojiu, and Lu Yutian, attended. More than 20 people attended, including Zhang Zhihe, Lü Chongyi, Ai Jieke, Zhang Xianlun, and Xu Aichen. After discussion, the following was unanimously resolved. The Race Walking Association has followed the National Sports Association and is actively preparing for the 50,000-meter race walking event at the 1936 World Games, without any slackening. It has been actively practicing since September of this year, and will practice the entire 50,000-meter course in 1935. This month happens to be 17 miles, so regardless of any changes or shortening of the course, those who have joined the practice are all advanced. Zhou Yuyu, Shi Jinsheng, Zhou Ruquan, etc., who have represented the Chinese team, have completely different steps from the 17-mile race, hoping to develop strong leg strength in order to seek further training. The performance of the newcomers is also remarkable, but they inevitably lack experience and are not very stable. Moreover, our Chinese team has won the championship for five consecutive sessions since 1928, which is a rare achievement and one of the most glorious events in the history of international sports. They are unwilling to lose it rashly. Moreover, the experience encountered during last year's competition is heartbreaking to talk about. Foreigners seem to be jealous of our Chinese team's continuous championship wins. Every athlete is strictly monitored from beginning to end, and they almost suffered a setback, but outsiders do not know it. Today, the racecourse refuses to lend to us Chinese because we are orderly, and their contempt for the Chinese has reached its limit. Therefore, in view of various relationships, our Chinese team seems to be able to abandon team participation in this session and only join individuals, limited to ten people. Because Mr. Beesliy, the general manager of the International Race Walking Association last year, restricted the participation of our Chinese, the ten people selected have correct postures and there is no need to be nitpicky, such as Lü Chongyi, Zhang Zaojiu, Xu Aichen, Chen Liwen, Lin Qiu, Yao Yaying, Lü Wenxia, Zhang Xianlun, Zheng Chengshan, and Cai Zhengyi. The registration fee will be paid by the team. As for the introduction staff, they have been changed to promotion staff in this session. Being behind the athletes is useless, and our Chinese do not need it, so we will not invite the so-called promotion staff.</p>

<p>The Xiqing basketball competition opened last night at 7 PM, with a total of two Group A matches and one Group B match. The confrontation between Youbang and Mailing was the fiercest. Xiaguang defeating Chizhi seemed like an easy task. Evening Star overcoming Tongwen was as easy as flipping a hand. Tonight at 7:30 PM, Dongwu vs. Junior (B1); at 8:20 PM, John vs. Nanxing (Group A).</p>
<p>Xiaguang Defeats Chizhi (Group A): Xiaguang and Chizhi are no longer what they used to be. Many famous players have bid farewell. Although there are new capable individuals, they are ultimately not as good compared to the past. Last night, Xiaguang's lineup was well-organized, and their victory over Chizhi was relatively smooth. Chizhi scoring two points was unexpectedly delightful. Who knew that Xiaguang would advance again and again, ultimately dominating the game until the end. In the first half, Xiaguang led 19 to 10. In the second half, Xiaguang's momentum increased even further, resulting in a final score of 46 to 22.</p>

<p>Mailing Wins Against Youbang (Group A): Youbang gathers famous individuals from all fields, and talent abounds. In their debut match yesterday, they lacked coordination and were immediately pressured by Mailing. Under their power, they sought a way out. However, with Mailing's strong offense and defense, superior skills, and excellent throwing and guarding, it was truly difficult to reverse the defeat. In the first half, Mailing scored 25 points, and Youbang scored 15 points. In the second half, Youbang put on a spectacular performance, creating a confrontational situation with Mailing. Both sides had ups and downs, making it difficult to distinguish between them, each scoring 15 points, which was exciting to watch. As a result, Mailing won 40 to 30.</p>

<p>The third International Handball Competition, the Public Exhibition Cup, is scheduled to begin today at 6 PM at the handball court of the West Shanghai YMCA on Jing'an Temple Road. Both the Chinese and Western YMCA teams have made thorough preparations in advance. The Western team has added several skilled players from Mailing, making their strength quite formidable. The Chinese team has been preparing diligently and has many experienced players, making their strength quite strong. Therefore, this year's competition can be described as having well-prepared teams on both sides with equal strength. The intensity of the battle can be imagined. In addition to the official lineup, the Chinese team also has new recruits, including Hua Fenggang, Cai Tongsou, Yan Peiqiu, Xia Zeren, Yu Guanghan, and Yuan Zongji, who are also quite capable and promising.

<h3 id="e223">The Women's Basketball Association Closes: Two Championships Return to Their Former Owners. Commendable Spirit. <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>This year's Shanghai Women's Basketball Association, after three weeks of competition every night, concluded successfully last night. The Group A championship was retained by Liangjiang, with Southeast remaining as the runner-up. The Group B champion was also the same as in previous years, with Champion Ruoqiangdong and runner-up Liangliang. In the last two Group B matches last night, Qiangnan defeated Huadong 29 to 9, and Meizhuan defeated Jiangjiang 29 to 22.</p>
<h3 id="e224">Excellent Spirit <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>Six teams participated in Group A and eight teams participated in Group B. However, Southeast, Liangjiang, and the two physical education normal schools accounted for six of the teams (three teams from each school). Although there are many girls' schools in Shanghai, they are still able to popularize and develop. However, the spirit of the teams that joined was excellent. From beginning to end, the event proceeded smoothly. No team forfeited at any stage, which was extremely rare. Liangliang in Group B did forfeit once, but it was due to the long distance, slow traffic, and traffic lights, resulting in a one-moment delay, which forced them to forfeit. This was truly unavoidable.</p>
<h3 id="e225">Each Team's Results <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>As for the strength of each team, except for Liangliang, which was the same team as in previous years, the rest were emerging talents. However, the results were quite remarkable. Southeast, in particular, made the most progress. Group A was still able to dominate for a time and compete for the championship with Liangjiang, and although they lost, they were not weak. For example, the school's branch teams, Qiangdong and Qiangnan, were like flowers in the spring, thriving. Qiangdong retained the Group B championship, and Qiangnan tied with Liangliang for the runner-up position. Their widespread popularity and development are commendable. The students of Chongde are formidable, and Huadong has many talents. If they are well-trained, they will surely achieve great things. What is particularly evident is that the teams' skills were mediocre at the beginning of the competition, but they made much progress by the end. Therefore, the last few matches were often full of unexpected twists.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Last Night's Two Matches <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>The match between Qiangnan and Huadong was very one-sided. However, Huadong often displayed wonderful performances as the weaker side. Unfortunately, their formation was disorganized, and their passing and shooting seemed somewhat illegal. Qiangnan's star player, Xu Wen, did not play, which undoubtedly affected their strength. The match between Meizhuan and Jiangjiang was a hard-fought battle. Meizhuan was strong in terms of average ability, while Jiangjiang was uneven in strength, and the outcome depended on this.</p>

It is reported that the two teams previously had an unofficial match, and the New Starlet team lost 2 to 3. The report of 3 to 6 was actually a mistake.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Special Article China: An Overview of Modern Educational Thought (8) Lecture by Shu Xincheng, Notes by Sun Yucai <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>The thought of Production Education: In Chinese history, there was only the education of governance. Although the "New Education" originated with an emphasis on production, when transplanted to China, all science, engineering, agriculture, etc., became the so-called "foreign eight-legged essays" (a derogatory term for rote learning), and were used as tools for successful governance. However, after seventeen years, due to the severe panic of the world economy, China's market was naturally contested by the great powers, and the domestic industry was increasingly declining due to the economic aggression of the great powers. The international trade lending tables could not be balanced, and almost everyone could feel that the education of governance was of no benefit to the country. Thus, educational thought shifted from governance to production, and the advocacy of production education greatly increased.</p>
<p>The thought of Rural Education: After the May Fourth Movement, various political and economic theories and doctrines were imported, stimulating the Chinese people to pay attention to practical social problems. Rural education was gradually valued by educators. After twelve years, the Jiangsu Provincial Normal Schools and the Henan Provincial Normal School established rural branch schools, gradually engaging in practical movements. In 1927, Xiaozhuang School in Nanjing was established, opening a new era in the history of rural education. In 1930, many university education colleges established rural education courses. In 1931, the Shandong Rural Construction Research Institute was established, further increasing the strength of rural education. In terms of thought, although there have been many proposals in recent years, they can be summarized into only two theories: (A) the theory of rural life transformation and (B) the theory of rural construction. Each has its own sufficient new insights, but the goal is to jointly promote the development of rural education, with no differences. The spirit of practical "doing" is admirable.</p>
<p>The thought of Mass Education: In 1927, the National Government unified China. According to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy of awakening the masses, mass education gradually became one of the contents of party-based education. In theory, it was vigorously promoted, and in practice, considerable achievements were made. We believe that the most effective were the China Association for the Promotion of Mass Education, which promoted mass education in Dingxian, Hebei, and the Jiangsu Provincial College of Education, which promoted mass education in Wuxi. These two places can also be regarded as representatives of educational thought. However, they were all educators who believed that mass education was a way to improve rural areas, and they attached great importance to its effectiveness, believing that it was "transcendent, thorough, fundamental, capable of solving personal life problems on a small scale, and capable of correcting people's hearts, changing customs, reducing internal strife, and harmonizing all nations on a large scale."</p>
<p>The thought of National Rejuvenation Education: After September 18th, due to the pressure of foreign invasion, the Chinese people's recognition of nationalism further increased. Academics discussing the issue of national rejuvenation also increased daily. Theoretically, the more systematic ones are Luo Jialun and Zhu Jiahua. Luo advocated creating an organic national culture to save China's current crisis. The most important meanings of the so-called organic national culture are two: (1) everyone must have a common intention to revive the Chinese nation; second, the efforts of various parts of the culture must become mutually coordinated under this intention. The method is the four words of sincerity, simplicity, heroism, and grandeur. Next, Zhu's theory is described. Zhu was the Minister of Education at the time. After September 18th, his sense of national rejuvenation was particularly keen compared to others. In July, he announced the short-term elementary school curriculum standards, which focused on restoring the national spirit. The Ministry-compiled textbooks could also be practically achieved. On December 1st, he issued an explanation from the Ministry of Education to come and reorganize the country's development together, further detailing the purpose of national rejuvenation education. He said, "China now, as a whole nation, must pay attention to national rejuvenation in education, and then the Chinese nation can be free. The Chinese national rejuvenation must depend on educators having two things: (1) cultivating the national concept of the people, (2) restoring the national self-confidence of the people." It is a pity that there is still no concrete plan for implementation.</p>

<h3 id="e239">Literary Inspiration <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>—</p>
<p>What is literary inspiration? No one has ever seen it, but everyone who is often engaged in writing always feels that there is such a thing in the world, and it is an extremely mysterious thing. Although wealthy and idle people will never need it, for the poor scholar, it is truly an indispensable treasure.</p>
<p>The ancients once said: "Literary inspiration comes mightily, like a gushing spring." Using spring water to compare literary inspiration is truly accurate! It is something that can be used endlessly. Sometimes, when excitement and joy reach their peak, it is like a sudden mountain torrent that arrives unexpectedly, allowing you to pick up your pen and write straight down without any obstruction. The good skills of writing ten thousand words while leaning on a horse are truly possible. But sometimes, when the weather is dry and the land parched, and the water source suddenly dries up, even if you hold a writing brush in your hand, and have ground the pine soot ink until it is fragrant and placed it in front of you, or even sit in a very comfortable rocking chair, and close the door of your study, you are still unable to find literary inspiration. No matter how much you rack your brains and ponder, you are still faced with a blank sheet of paper. At this time, it is as difficult as having to chisel a mountain to find water when there is no spring. Even if you smoke cigarettes like crazy and chew candy indiscriminately, it will only be for the benefit of your mouth and tongue. To think that literary inspiration can be ignited by this means is absolutely impossible!</p>
<p>I have another feeling. (Perhaps others do not feel this way, or even feel the opposite of me, then I cannot interfere, but I always feel that way myself.) The presence or absence of literary inspiration is not something that the writer themselves can control. In moments of joy and happiness, it seems that literary inspiration should be at its most uninhibited and flourishing, but often the opposite is true. In moments of sadness and anger, it seems that writing is impossible, but in reality, it often stimulates your literary inspiration, allowing you to write extremely good articles when you are not expecting it. The ancients often said: "Writing poetry and prose becomes skillful after hardship." This is truly correct! Others say that whether writing is smooth or not should be based on the person's knowledge, but this is because they do not understand or recognize what literary inspiration actually is. We must know that literary inspiration is definitely not the same as money. With money, you can buy drunkenness and laughter and do whatever you want. With literary inspiration, you cannot control it. It is absolutely automatic and absolutely mysterious. When it does not gush out, it does not matter how much knowledge you have!</p>
<h3 id="e240">The Modern Old Woman <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Ti</p>
<p>Shanghai is the birthplace of modernity, and also its concentration point. You walk onto the street, and you can see the modern beauty of animate and inanimate objects everywhere. Of course, only the modern beauty of animate beings can stir your heartstrings and captivate your soul; but there is also a type of modern animal that gives you a strange feeling.</p>
<p>You often see a kind of woman, who has cut her hair, put on makeup, wears glasses, puts on a cheongsam, and wears leather shoes. This is indeed modern. But you first suppress your feelings, and then take a closer look, and you know that her hair is already gray, her skin is already wrinkled, her eyes are already dry, and her waist is already bent. And her feet are still three-inch golden lotuses, like a crescent moon. Looking at the way she walks, it's even more wonderful, not swaying gracefully, but staggering. Really, she doesn't want to stagger, but wants to learn to sway gracefully, but because she is burdened by her small feet, she is unable to do what she wants, so she has to stagger, and has to sway. She is indeed an old woman.</p>
<p>When I see this kind of modern animal, I can't help but shudder. I don't know what others think? What about herself? But in any case, she is modern, and yet an old woman; I dare not ignore the facts, so I give her a noble title: Modern Old Woman.</p>
<p>But if you look around, modern old women are not only on the streets, but also in the world. It (the world) has already implemented democracy, but kings and dukes still exist; it has already opened schools, but private schools still exist; it has already worked hard on construction, but thatched sheds still exist... There are still endless things to say. Her image is very similar to what you see on the streets, with different tunes playing the same melody. Alas? Is this modern? It's simply a contradiction!</p>
<p>Alas! Modern old women! If you cut your hair, you still have to apply some black oil; if you put on makeup, you still have to heal the wrinkles; if you wear glasses, you still have to add some sparkle to your eyes; if you wear a cheongsam, you still have to straighten your hunched back; if you wear leather shoes, you still have to enlarge your small feet. Don't just focus on modern trends, and forget that you are old, so that people who see you shudder, that would be stronger than eating vegetarian food and chanting Buddhist scriptures.</p>
<h3 id="e241">The Forbidden Standard of Beauty <a href="#e241" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c241" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">241</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Renwei</p>
<p>In the film industry of Hollywood in the United States, there is a special group of people who don't care about anything else, but only work on the female stars. It is said that they spent more than a year studying an ideal standard of beauty; if anyone meets this evaluation standard, she can be called the world's standard beauty. This strict standard includes a certain height, waist circumference, thigh thickness, buttock size, weight, and skin tone. However, until now, Hollywood has not found their so-called ideal standard beauty.</p>
<p>I say that these people are really idle and have nothing to do, so they do such meaningless things. Not to mention that it won't be found in a corner of Hollywood in the United States, even if you search all over the world for a lifetime, it will be in vain. Moreover, the standard of beauty can only be imagined, not determined; the ideal beauty in my mind may not be the ideal beauty in your mind; in the tropical regions of Africa, the uneducated black people, their women, in our eyes, not to mention being beautiful, are simply ugly and somewhat frightening, but in the minds of African natives, they may not be their ideal standard of beauty.</p>
<p>Let's talk about the beauties of our China. From ancient times to the present, quite a few have been produced. However, because of the changes of the times, the standard of beauty has also changed. The standard beauty in the eyes of the ancients was a frail, melancholic, and sentimental Lin Daiyu-style consumptive beauty; in today's 20th century China, due to the gradual influence of Western culture, modern men and women want to learn some foreign styles in everything. The consumptive beauty of ancient times has obviously been eliminated with the trend, and the barefoot girl of the wild rose type is rising in due course. Although some women do not have a strong physique at all, it is good that science is now developed, and they can be transformed artificially. Moreover, makeup items are readily available. The beauty of their hair, needless to say, can be taken care of by the barber; the beauty of the buttocks can be created by wearing high heels; the beauty of the breasts can be decorated with rubber fake breasts; the rest, such as the snake-like twisting, can be graduated within ten minutes, so now there are simply standard beauties all over the streets in the city, our poets probably won't write about "the mantle of birth" anymore!</p>
<h3 id="e242">A Visit to Xu Yang's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition <a href="#e242" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c242" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">242</a></h3>
<p>— Tian Shoucheng</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Shiqi and Ms. Yang Manhua held an exhibition of calligraphy and painting works at the Youth Association on the second floor of Eight Immortals Bridge yesterday. Mr. Xu is good at painting, and Ms. Yang is good at calligraphy. They are a loving couple, which can be said to be the beauty of both, and it is difficult to combine both, so their collaborative works are truly precious. I took a car to watch yesterday afternoon and saw the walls filled with beautiful things, which were overwhelming. At that time, Mr. Ye Gongchuo was also there, and after browsing, he sighed and admired it. There were also many viewers who made purchases on the spot, and Mr. and Mrs. Xu treated them with great care and humility. I still remember that I met the loving couple in Lai'ai, Belgium, when our country participated in the Belgian Exposition three years ago. At that time, the two gentlemen each used their strengths to help the work of our country's representative office a lot, and we expressed our deep gratitude, and we especially admired the spirit of cooperation between the two gentlemen. Later, I returned to China, and Mr. Xu went to Germany to study modeling, while Ms. Yang studied in Paris. Each of them made achievements and returned with satisfaction. Now Mr. Xu works in the Health Department. In addition to his busy official duties, he must pick up his pen every night. I heard that most of his works are completed under the lamp. Not to mention his hard-working spirit, but I see his works, and he is good at both Chinese painting and Western painting. The flowers, plants, figures, birds, and animals he paints are all reaching the realm of perfection. And his wife is proficient in all styles of calligraphy, including regular script, cursive script, clerical script, and seal script. Each is extremely wonderful, and the brushstrokes are vigorous and not like those of a woman in her boudoir, which is very rare. Is this what is called a genius?</p>

<p>Chapter 19: Desiring to Be Together Yet Wanting to Part, Remembering Past Events in the Same Car; Half-Crying, Half-Smiling, Leaning on a Pillow, Sick in the Lingering Autumn</p>
<p>Gui Zhi tightened her face and said to him: Second Master, why mention the past? People can only look forward, there is no reason to look back. When Ji Zhi heard this, his face couldn't help but turn red, so they were both silent. During this silence, the passengers on the long-distance bus had already entered the waiting room one after another. The two people were sitting facing each other across a large space in the middle of the room, and of course they didn't look like they had any relationship. A man and a woman, under the condition of having no relationship, it was not convenient to say anything. After sitting for about ten minutes, someone outside rang the bell to sell tickets. Gui Zhi was about to get up, but Ji Zhi quickly stood up and said: The place to sell tickets is chaotic, let me go buy the tickets. As he spoke, he had already walked out of the waiting room. He had already walked out, and Gui Zhi certainly couldn't stop him. But when Ji Zhi took out the money to buy the tickets, he was thinking in his heart, should I buy one ticket? Or should I buy two tickets? He said he was going to Haidian, that was a lie. What would he do in Haidian? Visit his brother and sister-in-law? He hadn't made a fortune yet. Send Gui Zhi home? Their relationship wasn't good enough yet. But since he had promised to go to Haidian, he certainly couldn't not go. Otherwise, it would appear that he was deliberately lying. So he bought two tickets and took Gui Zhi to the bus together. The body of this long-distance bus was very high. A small stool had to be placed next to the bus before one could step on the stool and get into the bus door. Ji Zhi stepped on the stool and stepped onto the bus with one foot. But when Gui Zhi came to step on the bus door, she was a little short, and after trying twice, she still didn't get on. Ji Zhi was still at the bus door, and couldn't help but reach out and pull her onto the bus. At that time, Gui Zhi didn't think about it and grabbed his hand. (251)</p>

<h3 id="e244">Lip Reading Invented in Paris <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>We usually only know that fortune tellers use bone reading and palm reading to judge a person's good or bad fortune. Recently, spiritual scholars in Paris have invented lip reading. They divide the shape of the lips into six types: the first type is round lips, which expresses arrogance and a strong sense of self-esteem; the second type is semi-circular lips, which proves to be fanciful and indecisive; the third type is flat lips, which is full of emotion and most greedy for lust; the fourth type is pointed lips, which expresses various deep desires; the fifth type is oval lips, which is full of adventurousness and laziness and close to artists. We may as well use a mirror to look at our own lips to see which type they belong to and whether they match what is said above.</p>

<p>German Chancellor Hitler, in order to promote the spirit of Germany, ordered women not to wear makeup. If women perm their hair, draw their eyebrows, and apply rouge, they will not be recognized as part of the race. He said: The beauty of women lies in their naturalness. If they are artificially decorated to be charming, it can express the improper psychology of women. When our party gathers, if we see women wearing makeup, we should immediately beat the drums and attack them. Therefore, German women dare not decorate themselves, and cosmetics stores across the country will have to close.</p>

<p>Recently, a person suffering from a strange disease died in a hospital in Budapest, the capital of Hungary. His name was Shi Bian Kaili. During the World War, he served as an army captain and was very brave. Because he was frightened by enemy bullets on the battlefield, his spirit changed greatly and he could not sleep. Although he took strong sleeping pills, he could never fall asleep. It is said that he has not slept for sixteen years. After he died, the hospital dissected his brain nerves and carefully studied the cause of his insomnia.</p>

<p>According to recent statistics, the number of women in the capitals of European countries is generally greater than the number of men. In Berlin, there are 1,177 women for every 1,000 men; in London, there are 1,149 women for every 1,000 men; in Vienna, there are 1,169 women for every 1,000 men; in Paris, there are 1,195 women for every 1,000 men; in Warsaw, there are 1,185 women for every 1,000 men; and in Budapest, there are 1,192 women for every 1,000 men. Only in Rome, the capital of fascist Italy, there are 971 women for every 1,000 men; and in Sofia, Bulgaria, there are only 894 women for every 1,000 men. In other cities, such as New York City, there are 999 women for every 1,000 men, and in Chicago, there are 972. Therefore, Europe has become a women's world. This is the result of many men dying on the battlefield during the World War.</p>

<p>The gold market fell slightly yesterday, but the range of ups and downs was extremely random. The market once rose in the afternoon. In the early morning, overseas telegrams reported that the British and American silver markets both fell. The forward silver price on the gold and silver exchange fell by more than two li, the exchange rate rose slightly, the London raw gold rose by five pence, and the American new ore gold price remained unchanged at 33 yuan and 7 jiao 6 fen. American cotton fell by two pounds, and stock prices rose and fell slightly. American wheat shrank by 6.75 fen. It was reported that the American Chamber of Commerce replied to the former New York Governor's attack on the President's monetary policy, expressing opposition, and that they supported the President's monetary policy, etc. People's minds were not firm, and the rough market opened with a slight decline. Although the foreign exchange market was loose after opening, large households such as Guang Bang Heng Xing and Hong Xing rose, and banks took the opportunity to sell at high prices, and the gold market still fell. However, later trading was not smooth, and the situation was boring. Yu Feng Yong entrusted other companies to sell bars, which extended to the noon closing without any change. The afternoon market was extremely quiet, and the market was like death. Only the difference of a few jiao was quite long. Finally, due to the tightening and then loosening of the foreign exchange market, speculator Wu bought and sold again, and the gold price once rose, but it was a flash in the pan, and it fell even more after the closing. It was found that the situation was uncertain throughout the day, with only 3 yuan and 3 jiao of ups and downs. As a result, it fell slightly by 3 yuan and 2 jiao. The mediocrity of the market can be imagined. The clamshell price was 1,108 yuan. Now I will record the market situation of the day.</p>

Jiao Tong pulled the US dollar for March at 4375, and Zheng Jin turned in the US dollar for April at 5625. Heng Xing, Da Xing Yong, Da De Cheng, Tong Yi, Ri Chang, etc. continued to buy, and it rose to 8 yuan and 6 jiao. Da Fa Yong sold out, but because Heng Xing was still buying in, it struggled around 8 yuan for a while. Mei Feng stuffed the US dollar for March at 375, and Yi Feng Yong tried to sell it off. Zheng Jin also stuffed the US dollar for February at 125. It was rumored that HSBC's listed British and American prices had not moved, and it retreated to within 7 yuan. People's minds were still calm, and the goods also paid in, returning to 1 yuan. Tong Tai Chang sold out, and the situation still fell. Shen Kang, Tong Tai Chang, Zheng Chang, Yuan Sheng Yong, etc. sold bars together, falling to 6 yuan. Yuan Mao Yong, Rui Xing, Zhao Feng Chang, Heng Xing took the opportunity to buy in at low prices, and rebounded to 7 yuan, but because Chun Yuan Yong tried hard to sell at a limited price, it was difficult to rise again, and there were few transactions. After hovering, the noon closing was 706 yuan and 7 jiao, and the goods were auctioned at 6 yuan and a half.</p>
<p>The afternoon market opened at 706 yuan and 2 jiao, and the goods opened at 6 yuan and a half. There were very few transactions when the market opened, and it was calm and boring for a long time. Although Ri Chang went up to 7 yuan, Zheng Jin stuffed the US dollar for March at 375, and Tong Tai Chang, Yuan Sheng Yong, Da Chang Xiang, and the Dalian Bang all sold, and it was still difficult to rise. The internal market was also flat, only hovering a few jiao. Rui Kang bought in, but it had little impact. Shun Mao tried hard to buy in, and then there was an improvement. Heng Yu, Yi Feng Yong, Qian Chang Xiang, Zhao Feng Chang, Yi Da Yong, etc. followed suit, and it rose to 9 yuan and 3 jiao. It was Zheng Jin and Hua Bi who ate the US dollar for March at 375. Then Zheng Jin stuffed the same month at 3125, Bing Xing, Shun Li, Da Sheng Yong, Zhao Feng Chang, and Hui Xiang sold one after another, gradually falling to 6 yuan and 3 jiao. By the time the closing was 706 yuan and 8 jiao, after the closing, Zheng Duo stuffed the US dollar for February at 125, and the US dollar for March at 375. Yuan Mao Yong, Heng Xing, Da De Cheng, and Da Fa Yong sold out together, and finally retreated to 5 yuan and a half. The internal goods have been auctioned at 6 yuan and 1 jiao.

HSBC's listed prices were announced, and the shilling and US dollar had no rise or fall. After entering the market, only Zheng Jin and Qiao Zhibu did swap transactions. The market was still dull in the afternoon, and there were few transactions. The Central Exchange Bureau slightly paid in, and it once became tight after entering the market, but because Zheng Jin tried hard to stuff it in, it was flat again before closing.

<p>Yesterday's foreign call loan market price, although the morning and afternoon markets were still the same as before, calculated as one jiao, the flat fee plus water was very strong, exceeding the one jiao threshold and reaching one jiao two or three fen. People's minds were also very firm, and the situation seemed to be turning around compared to the previous few days. The transaction of call loan tickets was more than 5.2 million in the morning market for transfer, and more than 300,000 for new transactions. The transaction in the afternoon market was more than 400,000. The transaction in the small general association was more than 700,000. Bank collections and settlements: foreign banks collected and settled more than 2.0 million in ticket funds, 2.7 million to 2.8 million in foreign currency, and various goods, foreign exchange, mortgage cushions, and miscellaneous funds collected and settled more than 5.0 million in silver and 6.8 million to 6.9 million in foreign currency.

Withdrawals were 200,000. Banknotes collected and issued were 2.7 million to 2.8 million. Looking at the market situation yesterday, banks and money shops were greatly affected by the situation in Fujian, and most of them came and went. Chinese banks urged for payment, so the funds would inevitably appear to be excessive, and the market regulation would inevitably appear to be more dry. It is still difficult to predict what level it will reach in the future, but the dangerous situation seems to be worry-free. Also, the total number of exchanges in the local clearing house on the 27th was 7,381,213 yuan and 4 jiao 4 fen in silver dollars, including 3,631,734 yuan and 06 fen in silver dollars and 3,749,479 yuan and 3 jiao 8 fen in remittances.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the November futures of the Chinese Securities Exchange had been stopped, waiting for settlement on the 29th, so the market only did one month of December futures. The news of the Fujian situation was dull, and the central government still had peace negotiations, so both the bulls and the bears were watching, and the transaction suddenly became light. The market price was also temporarily stable. It was already closed at 3 pm, which was a rare situation recently. At the opening in the morning, retail investors sold a little, and the market price was slightly small by about 1 jiao to 3 jiao. It was quite stable after entering the market. Gold short whole six rose by 3 jiao to 4 jiao. The secondary market was particularly stable. Only disarmament and 19 openings were slightly small by 1 jiao to 1 jiao and a half.

A few sellers came in after entering the market. Salt tax, gold short, and whole six were slightly small by 2 jiao to 3 jiao. The results of the market price throughout the day showed that the ups and downs were mixed, with a difference of 5 fen to 2 jiao and a half. Only gold long rose by 5 jiao and a half, which was more. The trend was slightly hovering and waiting to see. January futures will be listed on the 30th and will start trading. The situation of the current situation will be more significantly expressed, so the future of the market price will not be so stable. The total number of transactions was 7,481,100 yuan, 1,000 yuan in spot goods, and a total of 3,220,000 yuan for salt tax and futures, 1,135,500 yuan for disarmament, 760,000 yuan for 19 customs good deeds, 1,355,500 yuan for 20 volumes and 20 customs, 610,000 yuan for gold short whole six, and the rest ranged from tens of thousands to one or two hundred thousand.</p>

<p>New Feng Foreign Firm reports that on the 25th, New York stocks saw light trading, with the market still firm. This was because the US dollar was stable, US government bonds continued to be strong, and commercial news was also very good. Firstly, the steel production capacity in the Youngstown area is expected to increase to 35% next week. Secondly, October export trade was the largest since October 1931. Thirdly, according to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, farm product prices and purchasing power increased in the second week of November, with mixed rises and falls in commodities. Roosevelt's speech did not touch on the economy and had no impact on various markets. However, silver speculators who had expected good news in his speech were inevitably disappointed, so silver prices weakened slightly. Half-day stock trading volume was 478,000 shares. (Wheat) Buyers lacked courage, and bulls continued to close out positions, but the market was particularly resilient during the reaction. If monetary news is favorable, it will rise. (Cotton) The market was unaffected by currency fluctuations and can be considered good. The Financial Rehabilitation Bureau's purchase price of gold was $33.76 per tael, unchanged. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>

<p>The yarn market is very weak, and the decline is intensifying. This situation was entirely caused by a certain bull. The yarn market should have shown signs of instability early on because inventories were too high and consumption was decreasing daily due to environmental factors. Therefore, stockpiling gradually increased, making it fundamentally difficult to consolidate. This month is the last day, and a certain association's affiliated bull with 5,000 pieces had no intention of taking delivery and settled at the current market price. As a result, people's hearts wavered, and the price plummeted by $6.90, compared to $6.50 in October.</p>

<p>At the start of the pre-market trading session, due to unfavorable news, a certain bull sold off in large quantities, and the market suddenly loosened. This month's contract fell by $3.70, and the distant month contract fell by $1.50. In the afternoon, sellers of this month's contract swarmed in, causing another drop of $3.20 for this month and $4.96 for the distant month. Total daily trading volume was 76,100 bales. It was found that Changfeng sold 3,600 bales, Tongji 2,300 bales, Hengchang 1,800 bales, Xincheng 3,600 bales, and Ruida 1,250 bales.

<p>The cotton market's decline is intensifying. Due to the sluggish yarn market and cheaper foreign cotton, sales in all areas are lagging, and people's hearts are weakening. Selling pressure is very strong, but some cotton merchants are still in a bullish position, holding on tightly, and the market is still high. However, based on the overall situation, the future is still difficult to be optimistic about.</p>

<p>At the opening of the pre-market Zheng Biao (cotton futures) session, due to the weak US and Indian cotton markets and the lack of hope for sales, coupled with the increasing accumulation of goods in the producing areas, this situation has been brewing for a long time. Once it breaks out, it will be difficult to reverse. Prices for all months suddenly fell by 6-7 cents. In the afternoon, prices for all months fell by another 0.5 to 1 cent. Total daily trading volume was 186,400 dan (a unit of weight). It was found that Xincheng sold 20,500 dan, Chungi 7,200 dan, Tongfu 3,700 dan, Gengfeng 4,000 dan, Ruida 5,000 dan, Yichang 3,500 dan, Yuanxingchang 6,300 dan, Yuanda 5,900 dan, Changhe 3,100 dan, and Senkang 2,100 dan.

<p>The Indian cotton market was calm, with occasional arbitrage sales. Export inquiries were very scarce due to disappointment with the Indo-Japanese conference and fears of rising exchange rates. On the spot side, outbound shipments were not heavy. At the same time, changes in the rupee and silver coin rates made speculators hesitant. Chinese transactions were rare, and European transactions were almost non-existent. On the factory side, there were slight purchases due to small sales of cloth, but actual demand still needs to expand in the future.

<h3 id="e264">Grain Market: Wheat Futures Weak, Spot Firm: Approximately 50+ Truckloads Delivered This Month <a href="#e264" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c264" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">264</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's wheat futures market showed a pattern of initial stability followed by a decline in prices for all months, both in the morning and afternoon. Imported wheat quotations fell sharply by 20-30 cents to as much as 80-90 cents. Therefore, at the beginning, people's hearts were still able to hold up. Later, due to limited buying interest and the government's continued sales, it was unavoidable. Therefore, the thoughts of outside investors were no longer firm. In the afternoon, the sharp decline in the flour market further shortened the opening prices for all months. Although selling was not very smooth, the market atmosphere was uniformly depressed. Observing the subsequent situation, it is feared that after continuous rises, there will be a temporary period of weakness. Spot trading has stopped for this month, and the number of deliveries is about 50+ truckloads. As a result, December and January contracts fell by 2 cents, and February and March contracts fell by 5 cents. The spot wheat market is still trending high and firm. Especially high-quality goods are increasingly popular. Kai Yao Bay wheat is quoted at $4.25, and Liuhe wheat is quoted at $4.00, with an estimated 1,000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e265">Flour Falls Sharply by Around 4 Cents <a href="#e265" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c265" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">265</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market showed a pattern of initial stability followed by a gradual and sharp decline in prices for all months. Imported wheat quotations from Chicago fell by 80-90 cents, and Canadian wheat fell by 20-30 cents. At the beginning, people's hearts were still calm, but due to the unstable situation, financial conditions in the local and external ports inevitably tightened. Moreover, the rumors of increased taxes on imported wheat flour had been around for some time. However, since the beginning of this month, prices have risen steadily and seriously, with the difference from the lowest price in the previous month reaching as much as 20-30 cents. Therefore, customers all thought of selling back, and bullish investors both inside and outside the industry took advantage of the situation to close out their positions. Because the market had reached a point where it could no longer rise, it was very easy to reverse and fall when the environment changed. As a result, the current month fell by 4.5 cents, December fell by 3.75 cents, January fell by 3 cents, February fell by 3.5 cents, March fell by 3.25 cents, and April fell by 3.5 cents.</p>
<h3 id="e266">Medium and Secondary Indica Rice Showing Signs of Loosening <a href="#e266" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c266" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">266</a></h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals totaled 60-70 loads, of which late-season rice still accounted for 40+ loads, with the remainder being thick japonica rice and fancy late-season rice. The amount of rice sold was similar to before, about 4-5,000 bags. The market situation has clearly distinguished between medium and secondary grades. Higher grades remain stable, while medium and secondary grades continue to soften by several cents. The remaining common grades of Jiangsu-Tongnan Port japonica rice are selling slightly less in this street. Medium and secondary grades are also clearly distinguished. Higher grades are stable, while medium and secondary grades are soft. Du Yang tip rice is mediocre. Yin Bian Yuan alcohol households are becoming less interested, and the market is continuing to fall by a few cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Arrivals from various routes totaled 34-35 loads. Sales of various types of rice on the market are sluggish. High-grade japonica rice on platforms and Bai Yuan alcohol households are moving slightly. Market conditions show that the price of new japonica Bai Yuan rice has fallen by 10-20 cents, and the price of Yang Du Port customer tip rice has fallen by a small amount, a few cents. The price of early thin rice has fallen by a small amount, a few cents. Yin Yuan is stable, and customer tip rice shows signs of fatigue.</p>
<h3 id="e267">Customer Indica Rice Prices Increased, Leading to No Sales <a href="#e267" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c267" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">267</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's customer indica rice market situation was such that because customer sales were active last weekend, people's hearts were hopeful, and customer appetite was also active. However, because the goods owners quoted high prices, traders felt that the prices were too high to achieve smooth sales and therefore adhered to their positions and did not trade. There was a need to ship goods to Quanzhou, Fuzhou, Xinghua, and Xiamen from all routes, because the grain reserves in those areas were not abundant and the need was very urgent. However, the collapse of the Fuzhou bank affected the economy, and those with sufficient financial strength adopted a wait-and-see attitude, while those with weak financial strength had difficulty with turnover. Therefore, the Fuzhou sales route could not be activated immediately. In addition, traders who purchased from native sources saw that the Minbang (Fujianese) merchants were adhering to their positions and also took the opportunity to wait and see. Therefore, the entire city did not have a single bag traded.</p>
<h3 id="e268">Soybean Arrivals and Inventories are Both High | Prices Fall by a Few Cents | <a href="#e268" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c268" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">268</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the total soybean market traded only 700 bags. Factories and exporters were completely helpless. Except for 200 bags of Guidetou beans purchased by domestic merchants, the rest were all purchased by local traders. Therefore, under conditions of high arrivals and high inventories, the market fell again by a few cents. People's hearts are unstable in the near term, and it would not be surprising if prices gradually decline. Du beans, sandy yellow, and Carved beans have not seen a surge in arrivals, and the sales route is also not very urgent. The market remains stable.</p>
<h3 id="e269">Oil Market: Zhejiang Camellia Oil Loosens After Rising <a href="#e269" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c269" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">269</a></h3>
<p>Due to new goods not arriving in the Han camellia oil market and sluggish sales of old oil, the market is also depressed. Chongjing oil is slightly above 18 yuan, Pingjing oil is 17.20-17.30 yuan, and Macheng oil is 16.50-16.60 yuan. There is almost no profit to speak of. However, it is heard that a small amount of new oil will arrive soon, but the price is feared to be more expensive than old oil, making sales very difficult. Local industry players have thin inventories, but sales have not been activated, so they all hold a quiet, conservative attitude. Zhejiang's price previously rose over the past two weeks due to increased seed prices, and oil prices followed suit. Jiaxing's own truck came to Shanghai and only sold at 20.02 yuan delivered, and then quickly rose to 22 yuan. Recently, however, due to the impact of the situation and the tight money supply, it has loosened slightly, hovering between 21.50-21.60 yuan. However, the Shanghai market has decent sales and has not urgently increased purchases. But now that the market has loosened slightly, it should stabilize. Those who need goods should take advantage of this opportunity, because once the situation recovers, it will have to turn upwards again.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market showed a soft trend again. The association's listed price for ordinary grade 24 coarse sand white dropped slightly by 5 cents to 20.15 yuan. The listed prices for grade 20 medium sand white and grades 8-9 Dutch red remained unchanged, and no transactions were made. Taikoo Sugar's B mark was 20.40 yuan, and Zhenji's No. 1 line white was still listed at 19 yuan. The remaining grades 2-4 were discounted. Chao Gang listed dozens of bags of new Chao Qing, priced at 15.20-15.00 yuan, and also listed more than a hundred bags of old goods, priced at 15.10-14.89 yuan. Jian Gang listed more than a hundred boxes of high-grade, each valued at 17.20 yuan.</p>

<p>Orchid bamboo twigs have not been listed for a long time due to slow sales, but land prices have not changed much, so it is difficult to pass the hair (profit). Recently, sales in Zhejiang have moved slightly, and industry players have slightly exchanged, but the listed prices have not changed. We must wait until the stomach (appetite) of the market turns strong before they can approach (transaction). At present, the top-grade materials have been listed sporadically, and the price is slightly reduced by 1-2 yuan compared to before.</p>

<p>Since Dong Galvanized Iron Sheets became active, various counterparts in the market (except for those with larger scopes and foreign customers) have been vying to purchase them. Therefore, their transaction prices have surpassed those of English and American goods, and the sales of English goods have been greatly affected, and the prices have fallen sharply. For example, the price of 7-foot Red Bird brand is 1.32 yuan per sheet, down 2 cents from before; the Little Bird brand is 1.29 yuan per sheet, also down 2 cents; the Red Ocean Letter brand is 1.30 yuan, down only 1 cent from before. In addition, the Wei brand is only listed at 1.28 yuan, but the recent incoming goods are only selling for 1.18 yuan, a difference of more than 10 cents. As for 6-foot English galvanized iron sheets, the Red Bird brand is estimated at 1.15 yuan per sheet, the Little Bird brand is 1.13 yuan per sheet, the Red Ocean Letter brand is 1.135 yuan per sheet, and miscellaneous brands are 1.10 yuan, also down 2-3 cents compared to the previous standard. The Dong goods are priced at 0.98 yuan per sheet, which greatly impacts the sales of English goods.</p>

<p>Since the changes in Fujian Province, military supplies of garden lead wire have been traded every day, with more than 400-500 dan listed. The price is 4.5 yuan per dan, but the inventory of this product on the market is not abundant, so it is very popular, and the standard has been raised. The current market price is also wanting 5 yuan per dan. Although there are no transactions in the current market, its market atmosphere is already feared to be solid.</p>

<p>(Genuine Horsehair Sleeves) Prices have risen sharply yesterday. Domestic Daohua goods are sold at 1.40 yuan, and auction goods are sold at 1.80 yuan. Western-style tailors' appetite for purchases is strong. The inventory of foreign firms is already insufficient, and it is anticipated that prices must rise soon. Following the popularity of riding breeches and coats, the use of this genuine product for sleeve linings has increased by 1-2 times compared to previous years.</p>
<p>(Fake Horsehair Sleeves) The sales volume in previous years was higher than that of genuine products, but this year it has plummeted. Most Chinese-style coats have been changed to riding breeches, and the business of selling heavy, low-grade overcoats is very rare, resulting in sluggish sales of fake goods. Except for slight purchases by domestic overcoat factories, market sales are very slow. Sellers have no choice but to sell at low prices. Yesterday, the ordinary brand was uniformly priced at 54-55 cents.</p>

<p>Yesterday's tea market was still deserted. There were no transactions for Zhenmei, Zhenmei, Xiumei, Gongmei, etc. Only Duder Fuchang Jinlong and other firms purchased a total of more than 120 boxes of local produce B-grade pearl tea. High-grade was sold at 73-75 yuan, and low-grade was sold at 45 yuan, unchanged from before. In addition, due to demand from London, the British firm Jinlong Foreign Firm also moved to purchase Qimen black tea.</p>

<p>Ge Xian rice is produced in Henan and Sichuan, and is a type of fungal plant. It is divided into two types: Xianmi flakes and Xianmi seeds. The texture is similar to that of wood ear, but this one is planted in the soil. Here is a brief description of the goods from Henan and Sichuan for distinction:</p>
<p>Sichuan Xianmi is of better quality. The seeds and flakes are not separated, and the texture is pure and clean, without the problem of sizing. Therefore, it is called "clean water goods". The color is black, like small ears, the flakes are round and flat, and the seeds are rice-shaped. Lower grades are gray in color, but otherwise similar.</p>
<p>Henan Xianmi is of lower quality. The seeds and flakes are packaged separately. Good ones are black in color, while lower grades are green. This is because this product is sized with green vitriol, so the heavier the sizing, the greener the color. Otherwise, they are similar.</p>
<p>For consumption, soak thoroughly in water. It is mostly used for hot stir-fries at banquets, either sweet or savory, plain stir-fried or with a little starch, as desired.</p>

<h3 id="e277">Yuan Zhonglang's Travelogue <a href="#e277" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c277" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">277</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Xia</p>
<p>Although there is no "fixed method" for writing travelogues, in reality, it can be said that there is a kind of "dead method." What is this "dead method"? It is clinging to scenery to write realistically, adding some lyrical feelings, and it must have a beginning and an end, making it a complete article. Throughout the ages, people who write travelogues have been bound by this "dead method" without realizing it, and there have been few new developments. However, Zhonglang's travelogues cannot but be said to be exceptions. The miscellaneous essays in the complete works are all travelogues, and these articles all have a different spirit and a different system. Sometimes, he writes about the current scenery, and sometimes, he does not write a single word about the scenery limited by the topic, only recording his feelings in that place. Sometimes, he writes a few words on a big topic, but he talks at length on a small topic. I think this unique spirit is something that every travelogue writer should learn well. Sticking to the topic and circling around it is, without a doubt, the clumsiest method.</p>
<p>For example, the most widely circulated of Zhonglang's travelogues, "Tiger Hill". For a general writer, of course, the main focus is on narrating the scenery of Tiger Hill, but Zhonglang does just the opposite, using very few words to briefly touch upon the scenery. His focus is on the tourists' mood, writing about the tourists' grand attire, writing about the tourists "setting up wine in the middle of the road", writing about "the accumulation of dirt on the sandalwood clappers, the pouring of wine vessels like clouds", writing about singing, writing about actions, writing about the brightness of the stone, writing about the pens. In this way, not only is the beauty of Tiger Hill more evident, but the "dead" Tiger Hill is also written as "vividly alive". Although he does not write about the scenery of Tiger Hill directly, everything he writes is about Tiger Hill, its scenery, its daytime and nighttime views, its vibrant life. A travelogue, like other writings, can be more powerful if it grasps its center of gravity and writes from the side, sometimes even more so than writing directly. Another example is his "Hundred Flowers Islet" article. He does not write about "Hundred Flowers Islet" directly at all. He only uses a dialogue to explain it. I can quote its full text:</p>
<p>Hundred Flowers Islet is between the Xu and Pan gates. One evening, I went out from Panmen and met Jiang Jinzhi on the road. I asked if the flowers on Hundred Flowers Islet were in full bloom and whether I should go to see them. I said: "There is nothing else, only twenty or thirty dung boats lined up and staggered, the stench is several miles long." Jinzhi laughed and left.</p>
<p>I believe this writing method is the most vibrant, and it is enough to express the author himself in a travelogue. Although he does not write about "Hundred Flowers Islet" directly, the ugly reality under such a beautiful name will give people a deep impression. For example, when he writes about West Lake, the writing method he applies is also the same. He does not write a systematic travelogue of West Lake, but only writes in fragments, and each fragment has its own independent existence that is different from the general. For example, the opening section of "West Lake One": "From Wulin Gate to the west, looking at Baoshu Pagoda, standing out in the middle of the cliffs, my heart has already flown to the lake." From the beginning, it has a special spirit. For example, the topic "Gushan":</p>
<p>The recluse of Gushan, with his plum trees and cranes, is the most convenient person in the world. We are only troubled by so many trivial matters because we have wives. We can't get rid of them, we hate to be near them, like clothes that are worn out and tattered, walking in thorns, worrying about every step. Recently, there is a monk Yu Ru under Leifeng Pagoda who also has no wife. He is probably the reincarnation of Gushan. Although I don't know how his Streamside Falling Flower Poems compare to Lin Hejing, it is said that he can write one hundred and fifty poems in one night, which can be said to be extremely fast. As for eating bland food and practicing Zen, he is even one level higher than Gushan. What era is without extraordinary people!</p>
<p>He simply abandons Gushan and writes about lonely people. There are many other similar examples. For example, the topic "Dragon Well", the focus of his writing is tea. However, Zhonglang is not absolutely opposed to writing about scenery. In many places, he also puts a lot of effort into the scenery. However, he is completely based on necessity; he abandons unnecessary places. We should pay attention to this principle. Among the West Lake articles, there is an article called "Miscellaneous Notes on the Lake", which I think is the best. In the short text, it captures the traces of four months and three trips, which is not easy. However, he still emphasizes writing about life. He also puts effort into depicting things and objects where necessary. There is an article called "Xiang Lake", which is about water shield. Let's look at his "Fishing Terrace" article:</p>
<p>The Fishing Terrace has two stones facing each other, no more than a zhang (unit of length) high. I don't know how many rods he used at that time, or how many pounds of fish he caught. Old Yan is useless, what is the difference between him and this terrace? However, his standing like a wall, looking down on the ruler of men, disregarding the steepness, is also equal to a stone!</p>
<p>This is simply a satirical argumentative essay. In many places, Zhonglang's articles express his own opinions in this way. This is the main feature of his travelogues. The reason why I bring it up is not because I fundamentally oppose narrating scenery in travelogues, but because I advocate that travelogues should have a richer life. If you simply narrate scenery, no matter how wonderful it is, it cannot be considered a living article.</p>
<h3 id="e278">Grandmother's Shriveled Nipples <a href="#e278" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c278" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">278</a></h3>
<p>— He Jiahai</p>
<p>In hot weather, Grandmother always wore a pair of shriveled nipples, with one piece of clothing slipped down her back. She bared her chest, blowing wind through her lips while desperately fanning with a wheat stalk fan, dissipating the time in the vegetable garden, the lane, and all the breezy spots nearby. But most of the time, she still liked to sit on that stone bench near the gate, peeling some bean sprouts or twirling some cotton thread. "A guest, a guest!"</p>
<p>I often teased her mischievously like this.</p>
<p>"Don't lie, you won't scare me. What does it matter if a guest comes?"</p>
<p>"They'll laugh at you for being bare-chested!"</p>
<p>"It doesn't matter if an old person is bare-chested."</p>
<p>Seeing me jumping around, she seemed to be very happy, because she often unexpectedly grabbed me, kissed my face, tickled the palm of my hand, and said with a smile:</p>
<p>"Try your grandmother's milk."</p>
<p>"No, no, I want to eat Mum's milk!"</p>
<p>I stubbornly shook my head. Where did milk come from in these shriveled nipples? Mother's milk was plentiful, like a sprinkler, it was not easy to stop once it squirted out.</p>
<p>"Little beast, you will eat my milk one day!"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Don't ask now, you wait and see."</p>
<p>"Let Dad eat it."</p>
<p>"I want you to eat it!"</p>
<p>I never took this to heart. It was rare for a grandson to eat his grandmother's milk.</p>
<p>But she actually guessed it. One sultry afternoon, Mother suddenly said to me:</p>
<p>"Baby, you have to stop breastfeeding."</p>
<p>"I want to eat!"</p>
<p>"You're standing up so tall now, still eating milk, aren't you ashamed?"</p>
<p>"But I want to eat, Mom!"</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid people will laugh at you?"</p>
<p>"Eat in the room, people won't see."</p>
<p>I refused to listen, thinking she was teasing me, so not only did I not agree to stop breastfeeding, but I also wanted her to take off her clothes right away and give me a meal right away.</p>
<p>"You really can't eat anymore, look—"</p>
<p>Mother smiled and unbuttoned her clothes, revealing two nipples, which were blood red.</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>I asked crying, feeling very disappointed.</p>
<p>"Chili sauce. If you're not afraid of your mouth getting broken from the spice, go ahead and eat!" I cried loudly, wanting to eat several times, but the chili sauce was really scary!</p>
<p>"I'll put chili sauce on it today, and tomorrow I'll put plaster on it. You can eat it if you're not afraid of your mouth getting stuck."</p>
<p>From then on, I didn't dare to bother Mother anymore, and Grandmother's shriveled nipples became my favorite. Because at this time Mother went back to her parents' house to live, my only companion was Grandmother. Although I knew that her shriveled nipples had no milk at all, I touched them all day long, and sucked on them with relish, making clicking sounds; at night, I slept with her, just like I used to hold Mother's nipples every night, I had to hold these shriveled nipples to fall asleep. It seemed that only in this way could I feel satisfied.</p>
<p>"Is there any milk, baby?"</p>
<p>"Not a bit!"</p>
<p>At first, I really felt the boredom of sucking dry nipples, but later I gradually got used to it, and seemed very satisfied.</p>
<p>Human beings are able to "make do" from a young age.</p>
<h3 id="e279">Regarding "Understanding Reality" (Continued) <a href="#e279" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c279" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">279</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Maoyong</p>
<p>As for the "Understanding Reality II" essay's argument, I simply find it utterly incomprehensible. First, Mr. Shiheng says the difference between his and my views lies in: I "see the function of art as a camera," while he "sees art as 'the painter's brush, paint, and canvas.'" But he believes my view is mechanical. Let's not discuss whether my view is really as Mr. Shiheng says. Let's look at his own argument: "If an image arises in the painter's mind, even if there is no actual model in front of him, his creation of the character can still be equally real." This is certainly true, but where do the images in the minds of our brilliant painters ultimately come from? If we say that the image is formed based on the memory of an actual model that has been seen, then painting tools and cameras are actually the same. There must be a real object as the subject, but the painter can rely solely on memory when painting and does not need to put the model in front of him. However, when taking a photograph, the object must be in front of you. However, if there is fundamentally no actual thing, then there is no way to take a photo, but is it impossible for a painter's image to arise? Take Sanine, for example. If there were such people in society, then whether it is a camera or painting tools, it can create a portrait of him. But in reality, there is no such person, so even the most skilled photographers and painters cannot create an accurate portrait. So I say: "Tao [the Way] has little to do with artistic creative power." Mr. Shiheng opposes my words. Does he think that if Arzybashev's artistic creative power were higher, he could turn Sanine from nothing into something? Later, Mr. Shiheng added the title of "prophet" to Turgenev, and cited the facts of "Fathers and Sons" as an example. I think it is ridiculous. I believe existence precedes thought. When Turgenev "grasped from reality" the "prototype" of Bazarov, the "prototype" of Bazarov already existed in reality. Others couldn't see it because others' vision was not as "penetrating" as Turgenev's. Turgenev's vision was "penetrating" and saw this prototype before everyone else, so he said it. If he didn't say it, this prototype would still grow, but this growth is due to objective social conditions, not Turgenev's artistic creative power. Mr. Shiheng said that Turgenev "with his artistic expression's accuracy, made this prototype gradually grow, and Russian society eventually produced the type of person that is Bazarov." This simply turns Turgenev into a God whose artistic creative power made Russian society produce Bazarov! Based on this, if Arzybashev cannot create a realistic Sanine type of person for Russian society, then his artistic creative power can be said to be weak!</p>
<p>I have done too little research on literature and art, and it is really presumptuous for me to discuss it with Mr. Shiheng from the standpoint of literature and art. What I hold onto is a little common sense. This common sense makes me believe that artists cannot create a "historical typical figure" with illusory "images," no matter how exquisite their artistic creative power is. I believe that a writer's correct understanding of reality is more important than the correct expression of art. Because, if there is a correct understanding but no correct expression, the "destruction" is like trying to carve a swan but ending up resembling a duck. If the understanding is incorrect but the artistic creative power is too exquisite, then the failure is like trying to draw a dog but ending up resembling a tiger.</p>
<p>Moreover, if something does not exist in reality, where will understanding come from? Where will expression come from?</p>

<p>"Naples."</p>
<p>Then Pierre seemed to see the fiery plume of Vesuvius in his bewildered eyes, and at the foot of the volcano, in the orange groves of Sorrento or Castellammare, many fireflies flew! How many times had he dreamed of these familiar names, as if he knew the scenery of these places! Ah! He really wanted to leave immediately, no matter where he went, and never come back, never write letters, never let anyone know his situation! No, he had to go back, back to his father's house, to sleep in his own bed.</p>
<p>Forget it, he wouldn't go back; he would wait until dawn. He found the sound of the whistle quite pleasant. He stood up again and began to walk, like a sailor on the night shift walking on the deck.</p>
<p>Another ship followed closely behind the first ship, appearing grand and mysterious. It was an English ship from India.</p>
<p>He also saw several ships coming in, one by one emerging from the deep darkness. Afterward, unable to bear the dampness of the fog, Pierre walked towards the city. He was so cold that he had to go into a coffee shop frequented by sailors to drink a grog (a drink made of hot sugar water, brandy, lemon, etc.); when the spicy and hot brandy burned his throat, he felt a hope again.</p>
<p>Maybe he was wrong? He knew his absurd fantasies very well! He must be wrong? He had accumulated a lot of evidence like someone compiling an indictment to accuse an innocent person of "wanting to add a crime without grounds." When he fell asleep, he would not think like this.</p>
<p>So he went home to sleep, and because he was determined to fall asleep, he finally dozed off.</p>
<p>Five</p>
<p>But the doctor's body only got a couple of hours of paralysis in a very restless sleep. When he woke up in that warm, tightly closed, dark room, before his thoughts even began to move, he felt that painful oppression, that unpleasant feeling after sorrow, which had been temporarily forgotten in his sleep. The disaster that had only bumped into us that night seemed to have slipped into our flesh while we were sleeping, destroying and exhausting us like a fever. Suddenly he remembered again, and he sat up in bed.</p>

<h3 id="e281">Fate <a href="#e281" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c281" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">281</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>Because of the second lottery drawing for the aviation highway, the saying of "fate" can be heard everywhere again.</p>
<p>Mother Zhang said: "He is lucky, so he won the first prize."</p>
<p>Sister-in-law Li said: "This was predestined in the previous life, it cannot be forced."</p>
<p>It's true, taking one hope out of five hundred thousand relies on "luck."</p>
<p>Regarding the words "fate," I remember seeing a story in a notebook, the gist of which is this! There was a couple who farmed for a living. The husband strongly believed in fate, and many fortune-tellers said that he was destined to have heavenly wealth, which he also greatly rejoiced in and did not doubt. One day, when he returned from the field, he told his wife that he had discovered a pot of gold ingots on the edge of the field. His wife asked why he didn't take it, and he replied that the fortune-teller had calculated that his fate had "heavenly wealth," and this was "earthly wealth," which he should not have. His wife scoffed at him. Their quarreling words happened to be heard by a neighbor, who rushed to the field to look for it. The so-called pot was indeed there. When he opened it, it was full of small snakes. He was furious, thinking that the couple really intended to make fun of him. So he carried it to their house and, taking advantage of the night, removed the roof tiles of the couple's house and poured the snakes in, shouting, "Heavenly wealth is here!" thinking of repaying them. Unexpectedly, as soon as the snakes were poured down, the couple in bed heard the sound and woke up in surprise, also shouting "Heavenly wealth is here" incessantly. The neighbor on the roof heard a clanging sound when the snakes were poured down, and he was also puzzled. He hurriedly stayed, and only one gold ingot remained in the pot. He couldn't help but laugh, and his chin dislocated as a result. By the time his chin was healed, the ingot was also used up. This story illustrates that everything has "fate." The villager believed that he was destined to get heavenly wealth and did not take earthly wealth, and eventually it was returned to him through the hands of others. The neighbor was not destined to have wealth, so the ingot turned into a snake. In the end, he kept only one, and suffered the pain of a dislocated chin, to punish ordinary people for vainly seeking blessings. This story has spread very widely, and this statement is deeply rooted in people's hearts, and can probably be used as a concrete explanation of the "theory of fate."</p>
<p>Originally, "relying on heaven for food" is the Chinese people's philosophy of life. When rising into the sky, they don't think of taking an airplane, but only hope that a colorful cloud will descend from the sky; when entering the water, they don't create submarines, but only hope that the Dragon King of the Four Seas will invite them; in times of drought, they worship the Dragon King, and in times of flood, they kowtow to the tortoise (recently, the Yellow River flooded, and a large tortoise appeared, and the river workers kowtowed to it, see the Lunyu Half-Monthly). Praying to resist foreign insults, reciting repentance can save the country, all disasters of war, floods, and droughts are all entrusted to fate, hoping that God will save them, and completely abandoning their own efforts. Thus, humans have also become a kind of animal that cannot create or change the environment. Whose fault is this?</p>
<p>But in recent years, the annual fortunes have been very unfavorable. Until this year, the theory that "the Chinese people's bitter fate is already destined" came out, and people's hearts became even more distressed. Fortunately, heaven opened up greatly, and the aviation lottery was issued, allowing the generally disappointed people to slightly recover some hope. Winning the first prize allows one to become a wealthy man with a round face, and even if one does not win the first prize but gets a second prize, one also has the qualification to ride in a car, and jumps out of the "bitter fate." In this way, once every three months (now every two months), each time ten to dozens of people, within a year, I'm afraid hundreds or even hundreds of people escape this "bitter fate" barrier. This is truly a great favor. Although the bitter will become even more bitter because of this, there are always good things. "Try your luck!" This year, everything is originally for fun!</p>
<h3 id="e282">Battlefield Sketch 1 <a href="#e282" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c282" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">282</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Peng</p>
<p>After a night of fierce fighting, our army finally advanced victoriously. It was reported that the enemy had fled far away, and the rear baggage team was ordered to follow closely and move forward; some used pack animals, some used ox carts, and some were carried by people. This took a lot of effort to grab using the forced labor method. In the northern weather of the third month of the lunar year, walking is very hot. The desolate wilderness, mountains, and land are covered with military boxes and bedding, especially the soldiers' shouts and roars, also mixed with the "Hangyu" sound of the porters desperately moving forward after being whipped, and the gasping and wailing of the animals rushing around like wild boars. The mighty scene is like a tidal bore in the Qiantang River. After walking about ten miles, we arrived at the place where the fierce battle had taken place the previous night.</p>
<p>Because we hadn't closed our eyes the previous night, and we had rushed on a journey that day, and everyone's stomachs were still so empty, we really needed a proper rest. In this desolate and dilapidated village, in a short while, it turned into a whole gray world. The old folks' things, as long as they could be swallowed, had already been swept away. The women looked on with wide eyes, and men above adulthood couldn't be seen anywhere. Perhaps they had already received the grace of the revolutionary army not forcing labor.</p>
<p>After a while, in a corner of a small thatched hut, a large group of various soldiers crowded together, surrounded layer upon layer, with no water escaping. "Damn your grandmother, death to these old literati..." This sharp scolding sound spread throughout the village. I went closer to take a look. Ah, a headless corpse covered in blood was lying on the ground. Some scattered pieces of flesh adorned this small room, emitting a foul odor. There were also two people in gray military uniforms lying diagonally on both sides, forming a "character 品" shape, their faces pale, white foam coming out of their mouths, bursting with some intermittent and miserable wails: "Help, old... gentlemen!" I immediately felt that these were undoubtedly enemy soldiers who had lost and were unable to retreat.</p>
<p>"I was originally a soldier under Commander-in-Chief X. This time, I was trapped here and didn't have time to withdraw. We are from Shanxi. In the end, that guy (the dead soldier with flesh and blood) became anxious and suggested that we might as well commit suicide first. He called us to gather together, and he detonated the bomb on our heads. He really killed himself, but unfortunately, we only each injured a leg, but we can't walk. Damn him, it's really terrible... Sir, please save us!" Then another tone, with a sad and pleading tone, used all his strength to tremble and complain about their experience in a mournful voice, which of course called us not to hate the enemy and not to end the lives of the two breathing ones.</p>
<p>However, mankind is indeed lacking in compassion. These two wounded brothers of the same class could not ignite their sympathy and warmth, and stubbornly put on a pair of enemy-self colored glasses, disgustingly wanting to beat them. Some raised the guns in their hands, murderously prepared to fire live ammunition, and some even suggested burning them with kerosene. After my painstaking explanation, it was also difficult to break their concept of hating the enemy. The last tragedy was finally staged under the two sounds of "Crack! Crack!" And those two wounded lives were ultimately unfortunately sacrificed under the name of the enemy.</p>
<p>This was an old story from three years ago.</p>
<h3 id="e283">Things to Know When Visiting Friends <a href="#e283" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c283" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">283</a></h3>
<p>— Shen Min</p>
<p>If you want to visit a friend; before you set off, you must carefully examine the status and wealth of the friend you want to visit. If that friend's status is higher than yours, you should prepare an attitude of twelve points of respect, and also put on a ninety-eight-degree smile to see him. Especially in conversation, you must pay attention and never reveal a poor state. If you reveal a poor state, then they will suspect that you are asking him for loans. You must know: "Friend" is the transliteration of "碰有" (pèng yǒu), which means "encountering someone who has." If you "have," that's fine. If you don't "have," then how will they treat you as a friend? If you are currently unemployed and want to ask him to arrange a position, or ask him to find a place to eat: then sorry, one hundred and twenty points of sorry! You'd better not open your mouth. Because the important affairs of the general dignitaries and Mr. Tycoons are very busy: their status is very noble: and you are not the brother of their concubine, so how can they arrange a position for you and find a place to eat? If you say the words you want to seek help, not only will they immediately show a very awkward look on their face, but they will immediately be cold to you and hate you. They will go to handle their official business early and not bother you. To put it nicely, they are respectfully declining: to be honest, they are giving you the cold shoulder, so you should ask someone else! You must also keep in mind that when visiting a "noble friend," you must not despise the gatekeeper, because the power to receive guests of his master is all in the hands of the gatekeeper! After you hand over a business card, his honorable eyes will first see what the status of the visitor is, and then he can determine the direction of the reception. If you are an unknown person, they will definitely not immediately convey it to the manager's office. You must not be impatient, patiently, calmly, and respectfully stand aside and wait: after he sends your business card in, he will come out and answer you with a sentence: "The manager is not free." If you are observant and sensible when you are about to leave the office, you should come back early tomorrow! If you are still unlucky tomorrow, you may visit the day after tomorrow. If you are still unlucky the day after tomorrow, you can visit day after day. Anyway, you have nothing to do? You have a lot of time? As for visiting female friends, it is also a very difficult thing? Although women are already free, liberated, and equal between men and women! But the men of our noble country are still stubborn and unchangeable, and most of them are inevitably affected by the Twenty-First Hour of the Western Calendar [a reference to antiquated thinking]. Therefore, sour storms often arise! If you go to a girls' school to visit a female friend, or to some agency or company to visit a beauty, then the servant who specializes in visiting will ask you your last name at the beginning, and who you are visiting: and the second sentence will ask you what you call her! At that time, you will feel difficult to answer. Should you say you are a friend? Or should you say you are a cousin? If you hesitate, sorry, they will give you a cold look and say very angrily: that she is in class or is working.</p>

<p>— Meng Yuan</p>
<p>Lately, I have often been taught by my wife.</p>
<p>For example, my getting up late and drinking alcohol have all become the materials for teachings; the beginning of the lecture is always a lightly described sentence, and then this sentence leads to another sentence, and then a problem is brought up in connection, saying endlessly! The final result is either crying or laughing, depending on how I deal with it.</p>
<p>Once, I accidentally talked about my past lover Cui, and inadvertently praised her a few times, but my wife did not say anything at the time; after a while, it seemed that another lecture was coming! Because I praised Cui's few words as a topic, my wife considered it ungentlemanly. Thanks to her for making use of the topic, the lightly described lecture began again:</p>
<p>"I see that you have recently learned to be fashionable and know how to smoke cigarettes!"</p>
<p>For me, it is customary to remain silent and listen attentively. Then, the following comes:</p>
<p>"I really don't understand, taking such spicy things, sucking them in and spraying them out, what does it mean? It won't make you full, so it's better to eat some snacks. And..."</p>
<p>I know that this word "and" means that she is entangled in another problem! So the following:</p>
<p>"Moreover, Cui also smokes, and I don't approve of women smoking the most; if I talk about you, you think I'm slandering her, but sometimes what she does is indeed..."</p>
<p>This pause turns to another question:</p>
<p>"You've been too scheming lately! Smoking is enough! You also want to do other things, and you don't write articles properly. You talk about women and close your mouth about women, and you think about women all day long in your heart."</p>
<p>"Who are you thinking about?" I couldn't help it: "Thinking about you!"</p>
<p>"Who wants you to think about me?" My wife said with righteousness: "I'm not kidding you, I'm worried about you!"</p>
<p>"Don't bother! You are worried about Cui."</p>
<p>"Who is worried about her? What does Cui have to do with me?"</p>
<p>"Cui and you have a big relationship!"</p>
<p>"Okay! I won't talk to you. You have changed now! I advise you and you don't listen; I tell you and you don't listen," so she cried!</p>
<p>After the lecture, I was silent, lowering my head in the dark and chewing on my wife's few words just now.</p>
<h3 id="e286">Waiting to be a Concubine <a href="#e286" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c286" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">286</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Jin</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang, who lives at number twenty-two, I heard that he used to be some kind of prefect, and now he has retired to live at home, enjoying a comfortable life. The house is decorated luxuriously, like a palace, full of prosperity. In addition to this mansion, Mr. Zhang also has several small mansions elsewhere, and he spends most of his time lingering in the beautiful concubines' places. This naturally aroused the infinite anger and jealousy of the first wife, but her own age is not young and her beauty has faded. In fact, it is difficult to maintain Mr. Zhang's restless heart. The first wife also knows this, and now she has come up with a strategy to deal with it.</p>
<p>Almost every morning, we can see the maid in Mr. Zhang's mansion coming out to the stove to fetch water, but we haven't seen her come out these past few days. A very pretty girl of thirteen or fourteen has replaced the maid's job. She is very slender and graceful. Although she is only thirteen or fourteen years old, she is already quite charming. Her clothes are also very novel and gorgeous. This makes us very strange, and we can't figure out who she is. If you say she is a newly arrived maid, she would definitely not dress so neatly. If you say she is one of their relatives, you would never ask her to fetch water from the stove. This makes us feel as if we have fallen into a fog, especially my wife, who likes to ask questions, is even more anxious to know the truth. Yesterday afternoon, she saw the maid running into the door, and asked her for news. The maid gently told her, and the mystery was solved.</p>
<p>Because the first wife is old and her beauty has faded, it is difficult to maintain Mr. Zhang's heart. She had long</p>

<p>— Zhang Laosan</p>
<p>(9) Such a Foolish Thought</p>
<p>After standing on the balcony for a while, still pondering this question, I inadvertently let a cigarette, barely two puffs taken, slip from my fingers. I glanced at the room next door, where the light was still on. On the delicate window curtain, the shadow of Sister Min was cast, seemingly watching some magazine or something. I picked up a grain of sand from the ground and threw it at the window. The shadow on the curtain gradually enlarged, and after a rustling sound, she poked her head out,</p>
<p>"Can't sleep? Come sit here."</p>
<p>Throwing sand was a mindless act. Since I was bored, I walked over without thinking. Sister Min was wearing a nightgown, revealing her ankles, and sitting on the sofa. A book was lying flat on the small coffee table beside her. I walked closer and saw it was a diary. I vaguely thought I saw my name on it. She patted the other end of the sofa. "Sit down, and don't peek!" she said, standing up and tightening her nightgown. I knew she had misunderstood.</p>
<p>"What's that book?"</p>
<p>I asked, as if explaining.</p>
<p>"A diary. I haven't written in it for a long time."</p>
<p>She took two cigarettes from the small coffee table, handed me one, lit them, and we smiled at each other, already speechless. I crossed my left leg over my right and tried to smoke, experience telling me that in such situations, one cannot remain silent for too long. Sister Min casually closed her diary, but didn't say a word to start a conversation. So I thought of saying something random, but every word stuck in my throat. For example, saying "Aren't you asleep?" when she was clearly sitting on the sofa, was as ridiculous as running into a friend at the cinema and asking "Watching a movie?" The same was true for "Going to kindergarten tomorrow?" since she herself had said that before. The sound of high heels came from the hallway. The Shanghai night was just beginning. I stared blankly at the ceiling, and Sister Min silently swung her bare ankles.</p>
<p>"When you're in love, you might have this kind of feeling," my mind raced onto the track of youth, fantasizing about a scene from a novel. "Why are you silent?" I asked myself, and smiled unconsciously.</p>
<p>"What are you smiling at?"</p>
<p>She thought I had found something laughable about her and asked, startled. I pondered with a smile.</p>
<p>"Such a foolish thought!"</p>
<p>(10) Always Looking Down on Farmers</p>
<p>When I woke up, the sunlight filled the window. The tea boy handed me a note scribbled in pencil on the back of a calendar:</p>
<p>"I rose early, and you were still deep in sweet dreams, so I dared not disturb you. I have gone ahead. Please write to me when you have found a place to settle down. Min."</p>
<p>Her father is a capitalist. He always looks down on us farmers. I heard that when my mother got married, my uncle was firmly opposed. My maternal grandmother, because my mother was meek and virtuous, finally allowed her to marry my father, who was a farmer. Now my mother is dead, and my grandmother is dead. Just like Sister Min said, our relationship has dissipated with the passing of the two elders. I am unwilling to risk great danger and humiliation to see my uncle. Although the newspaper often publishes news about him studying Buddhism recently, it is questionable whether studying Buddhism is to repent for his previous harsh treatment of others. My uncle only has one daughter, and none of his four or five concubines have produced any offspring. His regret is that he has white hair and no son to cherish him. He studies Buddhism hoping that "Heaven" will grant him a precious child. As they say, "When a man is about to die, his words are kind." If the Buddhist scriptures are truly sacred, then like "freedom," many evils in the world are committed in your name. Sister Min holds a great hope for the "future," probably for this reason?</p>
<p>I worried for a long time. It seemed that for Sister Min's fervent hope, I should go to my uncle's house once. It is not my shame that he always looks down on farmers.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, I boarded the Xujiahui tram and took a corner seat. Opening today's newspaper, a headline in the local news column caught my eye: "Philanthropist Xu Bingnan Initiates Buddhist Lecture." Subheading: "Held Today at Fangwai Villa." How unlucky I am to have encountered this event!</p>
<p>Xu Bingnan is my uncle. After building Fangwai Villa last year, he further tricked his way into the title of philanthropist. A Buddhist lecture initiated by a philanthropist naturally needs support, to form good karma! No wonder I waited for several Xujiahui trams, all crowded with people coming and going, like clouds. Never mind what value a Buddhist lecture initiated by a philanthropist has, how do these modern figures have such a strong interest in the Buddhist lecture?</p>
<p>Shanghai, this is how Shanghai has become today!</p>

<h3 id="e288">The Basis of Film Criticism <a href="#e288" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c288" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">288</a></h3>
<p>— Li Fu</p>
<p>Recently, due to the objective situation in the film industry and the general public's rejection of the formulaic film reviews of the past, there has been a surge in the promotion of constructive film reviews and the exclusive discussion of techniques. Indeed, Chinese film criticism has now reached a very critical moment. If it can rally well at this time and not go astray, then it will certainly be a blessing for the future of Chinese film culture. If we fail to see this imminent crisis clearly and take the wrong path in the first step of re-departure, it may lead the entire film criticism to ruin.</p>
<p>Promoting constructive film reviews and encouraging film critics to further educate themselves more richly are certainly the most crucial tasks at present. However, under these slogans, we must never fantasize that our past ideological criticisms have achieved a successful conclusion. Only because the past film reviews did not follow the right path, being sometimes accommodating, sometimes extreme, and mostly simply using formulas, film criticism lost the trust of the audience and practitioners. From the beginning of film criticism to the present day, the fundamental work of "films are not merely for entertainment! They should have some social significance" has not been fully achieved. Therefore, we must not simply interpret so-called constructive criticism as focusing solely on technical corrections and guidance for films. We must also quickly establish the principles of criticism and strengthen the ideological review of all films.</p>
<p>I believe that the biggest shortcoming of past film criticism was the lack of a definite standard. It is certainly a mistake to criticize Chinese films, which were produced under a distorted development, with overly extravagant standards. Conversely, it is also somewhat comical to demand from the film merchants of the gold-dollar empire principles such as enlightening the public's knowledge and raising cultural standards. Before we criticize a film, we must first recognize under what conditions it was produced. For example, "Iron Heel in Red Shanghai" is a production of the Soviet Union's Sovkino from 1931. Therefore, we have the right to severely criticize its vague analysis of love issues and economic systems. Because it is a work from "1931" in the "Soviet Union." Another example is "42nd Street," which premiered at the Cathay yesterday. This is undoubtedly an American-style film that uses romance and sensuality to attract audiences. However, when we examine it further, we can find that this film is somewhat different from other musicals. Here, there is not only song and dance, not only love entanglements, but it also depicts the inside of a dance troupe, describes the content of so-called stars, and exposes the sorrow behind the joy. Here, we cannot but distinguish these progressive features from the previous works and give a fair critique. To give another example, under the Nazi's iron-fisted politics in Germany, all artists lost their freedom. Therefore, for the works produced under such circumstances, even for the artistic "Dream Lips," we must also express some goodwill towards the artistic conscience of these producers who were not subdued by violence.</p>
<p>What we need is accurate critical standards. To grasp these standards, film critics should strive to understand the current world and society.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3 id="e289">Impressions of "Scent of Grass Beauty" <a href="#e289" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c289" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">289</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Zhong</p>
<p>The content and meaning of "Scent of Grass Beauty" narrates the bankruptcy of our country's industrial factories due to foreign economic aggression, which led to the tragic unemployment of workers who rely on their blood and sweat for a living. In particular, it tells the story of a "young lady" type female worker who, under the pressure of life, had no choice but to sell herself.</p>
<p>The content of such a story can be said to be a true portrayal of real society. At least the structure of this script is more progressive than similar films in the past. The film's presentation is in a "reminiscent" style, which is also a novel method. I remember "Spring Tide" also used this method, but not as "concrete" as here. This may give the audience a new impression. However, some audiences may feel bored, such as the scene where a carpenter who committed a crime due to unemployment narrates the details to the judge in court, which seems too long and too cumbersome. However, the configuration of camera angles is precise, and the rotation is also sensitive and lively.</p>
<p>Speaking of the performances, we must admit that the actors who played the worker Wang Ada and his brother were indeed very successful. Ada's timid expression and his brother's strong character each have different personalities. One is strong and one is timid, which can be said to be "mutually interesting."</p>
<p>In short, this film is already much more impressive than all previous domestic films.</p>
<h3 id="e290">Review of "Scent of Grass Beauty" <a href="#e290" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c290" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">290</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Li</p>
<p>The performance of "Scent of Grass Beauty" reveals the terror of economic aggression. Invisibly, a factory could not withstand its pressure and went bankrupt, causing a large number of workers to lose their jobs, affecting social unrest, and producing many tragic and depraved sins.</p>
<p>Regarding the use of this kind of subject matter, as long as it is handled correctly and strictly, it may become a very profound work that is sympathetic to the audience. However, in terms of the performance, the author writes out the entire story in fragments using memories, which inevitably makes the audience unable to see the tense performance in a series. Also, the subtitles with general descriptions are used for every scene change, which also feels too much and too rigid.</p>
<p>The foreign cigarettes displayed in a scene in the window, using "cartoon" paintings to reflect the outflow of money, is very interesting.</p>
<p>Xie Yunqing, who played Wang Ada, was able to fulfill his duties as a character in the play. His facial expressions are also very subtle, even though it was his first time changing his style. Xia Peizhen and Wang Zheng's expressions are also natural, which makes people feel satisfied.</p>
<h3 id="e291">Actor Selection and Makeup – Talking About the Rich and the Foremen <a href="#e291" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c291" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">291</a></h3>
<p>— Yan Su</p>
<p>When a director receives a script and wants to start filming, the first important thing is to choose actors that fit the identity and personality of the characters in the play. Secondly, it is also important to pay close attention to how the actors should be made up to suit the characters in the play. This is the most superficial common sense, and no one can deny it. However, I don't know why our Chinese films often use actors who do not fit the identity of the characters in the play to perform. This may be because among all the actors in their company, only that one actor is passable. The second is to focus on star-centrism. As long as he or she is a celebrity who has already become famous, they can attract attention and make money. As for the authenticity of art, it can be ignored. In domestic films, all the rich and landlords are mostly round-faced characters. They probably only know that all the rich and landlords must be round-faced. Secondly, in domestic films, all the foremen and the like are mostly fierce-looking with cross-flesh on their faces. They probably only know that to be a foreman, one must be fierce. Taking the role of the rich man as an example, not long ago, the rich factory owner we saw in "Gold Mountain" and the rich dance troupe boss in "42nd Street" were both successful. The rich factory owner in "Gold Mountain" expressed a kind of weak body and pale appearance, symbolizing the exhaustion of the bourgeoisie in the effort to get rich, but at the same time, he also expressed his domineering and incomparably dignified demeanor. The rich dance troupe boss in "42nd Street," who sponsored the dance troupe for a dancer, expressed a kind of "golden bull" silliness, but he also had his dignity. Speaking of the foreman, the foreman in "Gold Mountain" expressed a kind of treacherousness, cunning, flattery, and meanness, giving people a deep impression of evil-heartedness. Compared with the superficial feeling of fierceness, it is really the difference between heaven and earth.</p>
<h3 id="e292">The Progress of the German Film Industry This Year <a href="#e292" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c292" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">292</a></h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>The film industry in Germany has been on the rise recently, and judging from the current situation, there are obvious signs of success this year. Since August 1, the film companies have had satisfactory results in terms of production and film rental. In terms of production, credit has been increasing day by day, and a bank for film industry credit loans has also been established. The number of films rented and shown by theaters is also recording new highs. This situation is partly due to the efforts of those engaged in the film industry, but also because Germany's economic situation has recently turned around. The film production plans of the film companies, it is said that until now, all the productions are enough for the next quarter (winter) of Chinese screening. From July to September, the Film Censorship Board passed a total of 66 films, but in the same period in 1931, there were only 54 films, and in the same period in 1931, there were 61 films. The export of German films, from January to August 1933, in the middle of eight months, there were a total of 15,900,000 meters, but in the same period of eight months in 1932, there were 17,900,000 meters. Among the German films transported to various overseas countries, those in German-speaking countries accounted for 42% of the total. From the above, we can easily know that the German film industry is developing very rapidly.</p>
<h3 id="e293">The Script of "Forbidden Garden Spring" is the Same as Fox's Production of "Enchanted Garden" - Janet Gaynor Replaced Lilian Harvey <a href="#e293" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c293" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">293</a></h3>
<p>It was probably in July, right? This magazine once published a film novel, originally named Adorable, translated as "Enchanted Garden," produced by Fox and starring Janet Gaynor. At first, I was very surprised why this film has not yet been transported to China for premiere, but now I understand.</p>
<p>It turns out that the script for this film produced by Fox was purchased from the German Ufa company. It was rumored last year that Ufa and Fox were cooperating, which is also one reason. However, all the copyrights owned by Fox are limited to the United States. Therefore, the film "Enchanted Garden" can only be premiered in the United States, while Ufa company simultaneously used this script to film a film called Her Highness Commands, translated as "Forbidden Garden Spring." The content is all the same as "Enchanted Garden," but the title has been changed, and the actors have been changed. In this film, Lilian Harvey plays a princess of noble descent, while also disguising herself as a petite and exquisite maid. It is not easy to make the identities of the two different characters so similar. This is undoubtedly another new type of musical film with a very humorous court romance. The left is a scene from "Forbidden Garden Spring."</p>

<p>— Xie Yuesheng</p>
<p>Xuefang and Surong were chatting idly when they suddenly saw Hongyu Tianxiong come in. She quickly got up to greet him and introduced Surong to him. Hongyu, seeing Surong's outstanding talent and appearance, and his graceful demeanor, had already expressed her infinite enthusiasm to him in her heart.</p>
<p>Under the shady willow trees, sat a pair of young lovers. In the green and oily waves, reflected their beautiful figures. Xuefang nestled in Surong's arms, mutually intoxicated in the deep abyss of love.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Surong was suspected of some political offense. One-five-ten, they dragged Surong to the police station. This surprised Xuefang so much that her soul flew to the ninth heaven. She hurriedly begged Tianxiong to help Surong get out of prison. On a night when gray shrouded the earth, Cheng Tianxiong discovered this surprising XX mystery case from a quiet secret cave. He heard Cao Huairen and his accomplices plotting to frame Surong. He quickly reported to the detective team, but the alert Cao Huairen escaped before their partisans were arrested. Mei Xuefang, to thank Tianxiong for rescuing Surong, specially held a celebration party.</p>
<p>Time passed day by day, and the feelings between Su and Mei grew day by day. Cao Huairen, who was wealthy and powerful, of course could not make him feel peaceful and submissive. He had previously built a secret room in the countryside, waiting for Xuefang and Surong to come out to play, intending to imprison them in the mechanism, to avenge the previous failure.</p>
<p>Mei's mother, because Xuefang and Surong were missing at the same time, hurriedly invited Tianxiong to come home to discuss. Tianxiong understood the cause of the mystery case and, relying on his mysterious means, discovered Cao Huairen's mechanism. He comforted Mei's mother while inviting his father and sister to rescue Su and Mei. "Don't you like the surname Su?" Cao Huairen said to Xuefang in a threatening manner. He shouted as the henchmen whipped Surong, and a sinister beauty floated on his frightening mask. This could not help but surprise Xuefang and make her scream. Then, there was a burst of gunfire and noise, and Cao Huairen was knocked to the ground. Tianxiong and Hongyu, along with his father, Cheng Dapeng, rescued Surong and Xuefang.</p>
<p>Xuefang was grateful for Tianxiong's rescue and admired his courage, rekindling the fire of love. "Mr. Cheng, thank you for saving me several times, I am so grateful, how can I repay you in the future?" She said shyly, with a smile, slowly lowering her head towards Tianxiong. "No, Xuefang: I don't want you to thank me, I feel that I want to..." Tianxiong knew that these words were too abrupt, and the blood in his whole body was so tense that it seemed about to collapse. "Xuefang, I love..." This sentence containing sulfurous words finally exploded in Tianxiong's fiery emotions. (To be continued)</p>
