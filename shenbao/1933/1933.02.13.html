<h3>結論全文</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）九人小組委員會報告之結論全文、共分十節如下、</p>
<p>㈠提交國聯大會之中日爭議、起於滿洲、滿洲者、乃中國亦外國所認爲中國之一部、在中政府主權之下者也、</p>
<p>日政府在其對於調查團報告書之意見書中、提出爭點、以爲中國前給予俄國後由日本所得之權利、在極有限制之區域、即所謂南滿鐵路區域內者、實與中國主權抵觸、</p>
<p>實則此項權利、由於中國權而產生、中國前給予俄國後給予日本之權利、在事實上產生於中國之主權、</p>
<p>中政府在一九○五年北京條約下、依允俄國根據樸資茅條約將各種權利給予日本之轉讓、一九○五年日本逕向中國請求其在滿權利之擴張、並於一九一五年五月二十五日與中政府締結關於南滿與東內蒙之條約、</p>
<p>日本在華府會議中放棄其在南滿與東內蒙若干主要權利、聲明其所以有此决議、實爲公允與溫和之觀念所遵成、日本固始終顧及中國之主權與均等機會之原則也、</p>
<p>九國公約適用於滿洲、與適用於中國他處同、</p>
<p>最後在目前爭議之初幕中、日本從未辯稱滿洲不是中國整個的一部分、日本甚至主張應由有關係之兩造即中日兩國解决此項爭議、</p>
<p>㈡國聯大會於紀錄此種事實時、未嘗忘却滿洲自治之習慣、在一極端事件之習慣、已使自治爲可能、例如張作霖以中國自治東三省之名義、於一九二四年九月二十日與俄國締結關於中東鐵路·航務·及邊疆劃界等之協定是也、</p>
<p>但就此協定之條文觀之、願見東三省之政府、並未自視爲中國關係的之一政府、但自信其可與及應與俄國談判關係中國在東三省內的利益之問題、藎鑒於中央政府會於數月前亦與俄國締結關於上述某種間題之協定也、</p>
<p>滿洲此項自治權、又可於行政中見之、張作霖歷次宣布之獨立、從未作渠自己或滿洲人民願與中國分離之解、</p>
<p>滿洲雖經過歷次戰事及獨立時代、而始終爲中國整個的一部分、且自一九二八年起、張學良亦承認中華國民政府之權力、</p>
<p>㈢在一九三一年九月以前之二十五年中、滿洲與中國之政治及經濟的維檕、愈臻堅固、而日人在滿洲之利益亦繼續發展、東三省在中華民國之下、門戶大開、以容納各省之華人、而華人因置有土地、乃以許多方法使滿洲成爲長城以南的中國一種簡單的開拓、</p>
<p>在數約三千萬之人民中、估計華人或同化的滿人佔二千八百萬人、</p>
<p>在張作霖與張學良治權之下、中國人民與利益、在發展滿洲經濟利源中、較前更爲重要、</p>
<p>㈣日本在此時期內、亦取得或要求滿洲境內之權利、此種權利以非常之狀態與非常之程度、限制中國主權之實施、因關東政府在實際上所行施者、等於完全的主權也、</p>
<p>日本沿南滿鐵路管理鐵路區域、中有數鎭、及如瀋陽与長春繁庶城邑之重要部分、</p>
<p>日本在此種地方管轄警務·捐稅·教育·與公用事業、</p>
<p>日本在東三省若干部分、駐有武裝軍隊、租借地有關東軍、鐵路區域有護路隊、各處尙有領署警察隊、</p>
<p>如雙方皆自願有之或接受之、而有密切經濟與政治合作的政策、則此種事態未嘗不可賡續、而不釀成糾紛及無窮之爭議、否則勢必釀成相互誤會與衝突也、</p>
<p>雙方權利之互相連接、法律地位之不定、及日人之所抱特殊地位的觀念、與華人所抱民族主義的主張之日臻抵觸、復爲各種事端與爭議之源、</p>
<p>在一九三一年九月十八日前、雙方皆有合法的不滿意、日本利用其有疑問的權利、中國阻撓無疑問的權利之實施、</p>
<p>在九一八事變方作以前、曾作以外交和平方法解决懸案之努力、而此努力猶未窮盡、但緊張增甚、日本主張如有必要、作武力之解决、</p>
<p>㈤目前爲中國之過度與國家建設的時期、雖有一中央政府、及不少的進步但勢難免引起政治波瀾、而需國際合作政策之採用、</p>
<p>此種政策結果之一、將爲國聯繼續以中國所將請求之技術上的輔助給予中國、以革新其制度、偉國人改造與鞏固其國家、</p>
<p>華府會所發起之國際合作政策、遲遲未得充分之晾解、其所以致此者、尤爲中國隨時所施排外宣傳暴烈、而經濟排斥之需用、與學校中排外之教育、亦助成目前爭議發生之空氣、願華府會議之指導的原則、在今日仍屬必要也、</p>
<p>㈥九一八以前之抵制、以表示對於某種事件之憤懣、或援助某種要求者、亦不免增重業已緊張之時局、</p>
<p>九一八以後之抵制、歸於報復之一類、尙有不得不言者、就國際關係上之一般的觀察而言、暴烈之計畫、勢必引起對抗的暴烈計畫、</p>
<p>㈦國聯盟約關於解决爭議之條文、其正確目的、在阻止國際間之緊張、不使之變爲似不可免之决裂、</p>
<p>調查委員團查覺每項爭端、皆可以公斷解决之、因爭端積壓愈多、則緊張愈甚、是以自以爲受損害之國遇外交談判延宕過久之時、其責任在促請國聯注意於此種局勢、國聯盟約第十二條固載有關於和平解决爭議之正式義務也、</p>
<p>㈧包括九一八夜日本軍官或自信其所行動係合法的防衛之可能性在內、是夜瀋陽與滿洲他處之日軍所採行之軍事行動、終不能認爲自衛之計畫、即在爭議進程中所發展之整個的日本軍事的計畫、亦不能視爲出於自衛也、尤有進者、合法自衛計畫之採行、並不使一國免除盟約第十二條下之義務、</p>
<p>㈨九一八以後日本軍事當局在民政軍政事件上之活動、乃爲眞正政治理由所策動、</p>
<p>逐步的軍事佔領、已使所有重要城邑脫離中國管轄、而民政即於佔據後加以改組、</p>
<p>日本文武官員之集團計畫·組織·並在滿洲實施一種獨立運動、以此爲九一八事變後所有滿洲時局之解决方法、職是之故、乃利用若干有名華人</p>
<p>·少數人民·及當地不滿意於中國行政的團體之名義與活動、</p>
<p>此項運動由日本陸軍參謀部輔助而指導之、僅因日軍之在場而得實現、不能視爲自然產生與其眞正獨立運動也、</p>
<p>㈩因上述運動而產生之滿洲國政府、其所有之主要政權、現皆操於日本官員與顧問之掌握中、彼等處處可切實支配行政之地位、</p>
<p>以一般言、滿洲華人佔滿洲人民之絕大多數、並不擁護此種政府、而視之爲日人掌握中之傀儡、自調查委員團完成其報告書後、滿洲國雖爲日本所承認、然未爲任何他國所承認、此當注意者也、（十二日路透社電）</p>
<h3>建議案內容</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）據非式方面而可相信之消息、九人起草委員會所制定之建議書草案、共有三章、</p>
<p>第一章第一節申述國聯盟約·非戰公約·及華盛頓九國條約·關於中國領土完整之條文、並謂凡此原則均當遵守、第二節申述一九三二年三月十一日、國聯會特別大會之决議案、並謂此項决議案、亦應遵守、第三節申述李頓報告書第九章十項原則、此項原則、業經大會予以通過、認爲滿意解决之必要條件、</p>
<p>第二章第一節建議設立一「談判委員會」、俾按照中國在滿洲之主權、設立一自治政府、維持秩序、并保障日本之合法利益、第二節建議該委員會應首先處理日本軍隊撤退至南滿鐵路區域以內事宜、第三節建議實施李頓報告書第九章其他各項原則、第四節規定談判委員會應促進中日兩國直接談判、至遇有困難時、該委員會應即報告大會、决定辦法、至該委員會之職權·組織·及管轄范圍一問題、曾由起草委員會熱烈辯論、最后决定、賦以解决中日關係整個問題之職權、規定談判委員會應由非常大會指派之各國代表組織成之、並主張向大會建議、就華盛頓九國條約簽字各國、暨十九國委員會會員中、指定代表、又决定邀請蘇聯政府參加、談判委員會如是組成之後、尙須加入中日兩國代表、于以見該委員會并無仲裁之權力、該委員會之使命、何時完成、并定有期限、其職務直至向大會提出報告書時、始乃完畢、</p>
<p>第三章　向國聯會全體會員國建議、請匆承認「滿洲國」、並勿出以妨害談判委員會工作之行動、即非國聯會會員國、亦將請其採取同一態度云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）十九特委會之九人小組會十一日集議三小時、以滿場一致之同意、完成其重要之報告書、此乃數月前人所未能輕信者也、其猶待最後修飾者、　關于談判委員會之數點耳、起草委員會午後三時半開會、歷三小時　會、建議案亦已完成、將於星期一日提交十九特委會之全體會議、</p>
<p>〓建議案根據盟約精神〓建議案所採用之根據、爲國聯盟約·非戰公約·九國公約·一九三一年十二月十日已故法總理白里安之宣言·一九三二</p>
<p>年三月十一日國聯大會之决議案·及李頓報告書、建議案特別言及李頓報告書第九章第七項原則、即滿洲新民政制度應適合中國行政與土地主權、及日本在該處特殊利益而組織之是也、</p>
<p>〓組織委員會督促談判〓建議案勸兩造開始談判、以期以國聯大會所指定委員會之協助襄助、謀取爭議之解决、而在此委員會中、非會員國·及非戰公約與九國公約簽字國·（即美俄兩國）亦可被請加入談判、委員會如過僵局、得向國聯大會報告之、國聯會員國依允不作與此建議案不相適合之行動、並依允須繼續不承認滿洲現有之制度、談判委員會在此報告書通過後一個月內、由國聯秘書長組織之、以上爲建議案之要點、</p>
<p>〓製裁條欵獲一般了解〓但九人小組會亦已討論其他許多各點、而尤注意於如任何一造拒絕建議案、則將如何應付之一點、聞小組會已議定國</p>
<p>國聯盟約、規定三個月之猶豫期、應從聯大會通過此報告書之日算起、瑞士代表犘太博士提出强迫公斷之問題、但未有决議、而十九特委會賡斷與否之問題、亦未有决定、談判委員會人數幾何、將由國聯决定之、但預料未必多逾十二人、參加者爲在遠東最有關係之國、大約將以各國駐華代表充之、雖一般人雅不願言及採用國聯盟約第十六章制裁條文之可能性、然了解未可將此問題置之不顧、蓋防談裝之失敗也、報告書其餘各點、與已見電傳者相同、</p>
<p>〓報告書全部共分四段〓報書首爲序文、述調解失敗、不得不愋用國聯盟約第十五條第四節繕具報告書之經過情形、第一段追述遠東所發生之往事、並引用李頓報告書首八章之全文、指此爲中日爭議背景之公允的完全的紀載、第二段言日內瓦事、及其餘遠東之歷史上的關係、以便說明行政院與大會屢次通過决議案之理由、並徵引關於上海事件之領署報告、補叙李頓報告書編成後所發生之事件、而對於山海關之事件、及日本擬佔熱河之消息、亦略有陳述、第三段爲結論文、第四段爲建議案、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>[P日本决與國聯作戰</p>
<p>表示寗不顧代價</p>
<p>對僞滿堅不放棄</p>
<p>覆文十三日晚發出</p>
<p>（東京）據今日此間可恃消息、日本答覆十九特委會詢問之文、將以嚴峻明白之詞句、向全世界宣布其不顧代價、必維持「滿洲國」獨立之决心、又聞日本將豫先聲明不顧因國聯建議案而受束縛、或改變其此種政策云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日外部下午召開陸軍與外交部連席會議、决定覆文原則、由谷亞洲司長負責起草、明晨再開部會修改、然後提出臨時閣議取决、經日皇批准、預定十三日傍晚發出訓電、其所傳之大綱如次、㈠日新提案並不是接受李頓報告書第九章之各原則、僅同意以該報告爲參考、㈡日本正式承認「滿洲國」之獨立、爲旣成之事實、日政府决不能撤消此種事實、或取消「滿洲國」、故李頓報告書第九章十原則中之第七項不能承認、㈢承認「滿洲國」爲獨立國家、係日本之國策、在此三個月來日代表累次聲明在前、各國當已了解、不用多說、㈣十九國之質問書、其宗旨在使日本國策發生動搖、日本斷不能承認、</p>
<p>故其責任由國聯負擔、（十二日華聯電）</p>
<h3>日人震驚不寗</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）衆認起草委員會所草建議、無異明白斥責日本在滿侵略政策、此次十九國委員會具有堅决主張、及起草委員會內各列强連英法在內、顯似贊成國聯對日取較强態度、已使此間日人爲之驚震不寗、照目前形勢大會似可接受委員會之建議、果爾則料日本將不免立即退出國聯、即至少亦將撤回其出席國聯與軍縮會議之代表、（十九日國民社電）</p>
<h3>日本欲顧全面子國聯豈願丟臉</h3>
<p>英政論家發表言論</p>
<p>（倫敦）著名政治著述家史梯德今日在星期泰晤士報發表其言論、謂國聯小組會關於中日爭議之建議案論調、乃過去數星期中某某數大國態度變更之顯明表示、此種變更已在東京發生影響、該處退出國聯之恫嚇聲、近已不復如從前之堅强、東京政界在過去一月中、已深知日本與世界爲敵之危險、故日本之不拒絕小組會建議案、雖不能斷其必然、殆亦爲意中事、國聯方面苟繼續其全體一致之意見、則當可造成堪以容受之解决也、日政府或覺「滿洲國」承認之取消、未免過於丟臉、此種考豦固　要緊、伹國聯本身宜須考慮、如承認自己無促成一種解决之能力、或繼續承認蔑視其權威之一大國爲其行政院之一份子、不將在世界各處丟臉乎云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>日本脫退問題</h3>
<p>民政黨反對由國會議决</p>
<p>主張聽任政府善自處理</p>
<p>（東京）國聯形勢喫緊以來、政友會內之軍閥派議員倡在國會議决退出國聯、因事關外交策略、政友會領袖均不敢表示輕舉、民政黨方面則絕對反對、其理由謂若一旦在國會議决、則政府失其自由、退出國聯之言辭、已失其恫嚇作用、政府如遵守院議、及時不能退出、又將發生國會威嚴問題、故不如一任政府完善處理、以免生出其他矛盾、（十二日華聯電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>𤍠河問題與最後决心</h3>
<p>乃</p>
<p>就大勢言中日紛爭最後解决之途徑。不外二端。不計利害。不䘏犧牲。破釜沉舟。以圖一戰。此其一也。割讓東北。偏安關內。含垢忍辱。屈膝求和。此又其一也。然而和既不和。戰又不戰。觀望趦趄。遂成今日之局勢。</p>
<p>國家大事。誠未可鹵莽滅裂。以圖取快於一時。觀望趦趄。或亦有其深遠之意義。然其意義。果何在乎。逆來順受。以冀强敵之覺悟乎。則始之以不抵抗而坐失三省者。繼復不發一彈而棄錦州。最近榆關之役。至敵兵爬城而始加拒抗。忍耐亦可謂至矣。然榆關失陷之後。繼又有九門口之襲擊。日來復有堅决攻𤍠之準備。得寸進尺。我示弱則彼愈肆橫。其勢亦已明甚矣。將欲引濟案滬案之先例。謂敵兵終可退出我土地乎。則須知日人心目中之東三省。逈非濟滬所可比擬。而濟案滬案之成因。與所造成之局勢。亦遠不如瀋案之嚴重也。將徐待國際間公理之制裁乎。則一年餘呼號於日內瓦。奔走於歐美都會之結果。內則失地愈多。外則國際間輿論。轉過淡漠。國聯之對日手腕。亦日超越軟弱。遷延不决。徒胎日人以勾結列强之機耳。將坐待世界大戰之爆發。以收漁人之利乎。則守株待兔。期以何年。蘇俄對日。既以容忍爲得訃。美國之遠東政策。恐亦止於文字之抗爭。遠東之戰。非至中國沿海沿江一帶。悉入於戰爭狀態。恐决無第三國之參加。吾人欲希冀任何國家作仗義興師之豪舉。將等於望梅以止渴。而戰爭之對。象既爲中國。所謂漁人之利者。要亦有待於我之能發奮以圖强。否則一國蹂躪之不足。將轉爲列國角逐之疆場耳。將謂準備未充。佈置未善。不得不期以時日乎。則自九一八事變至於今日。已幾及一年五個月。當已有相當之布置。謂必布置至若何計出萬全。而後始與一戰。則世界决無此戰事也。</p>
<p>中日糾紛。至今日而達圖窮匕見之階段、外則國聯之形勢已不能再作進一步之敷衍搪塞。內則民情對日之憤慨。已非復徒託空言所能爲功。戰歟和歟。至今日而不能再容我觀望再任我趦趄。孰取孰舍。至今日而不能不有最後之决心。然吾人審察年來中日糾紛演變之歷史。不能不認今日之局勢已無和之可能。則所謂最後之决心者。亦日戰而已矣。</p>
<p>今日國人所願慮於戰者。究何在乎。謂恐引起世界之大戰乎。則世界之大戰。强國如日本。或其渝於敗亡。次殖民地之中國。固已無復衰落之可能。素封之家。尋隙滋事。赤貧之戶。反禮讓自持。以大局爲已任。則其不倫。孰有逾於此者乎。謂恐不戰僅失三。省戰或須失六省乎。則須知惟在此不死不活的妥治局面之下。日人乃能安然逐歩以囊括全國。鬥爭之高潮既起。則竭日本全國之兵力。恐未見其能敷六省之佈防。幣原所謂呑滿洲如呑炸彈。者正謂我之能起而鬥爭也。謂恐內之不安無以攘外乎。則須知內之不安正。因外之未攘。目下喧呶之政見。非有一對外之鬥爭决不能加以調和。致其團結。農村破產下之民衆。非有一對外之鬥爭。决不能冀其安於貧困。而不挺而走險。歷史之所昭示於吾人者。則沉悶之後。必生劇變。抑　之民氣。如不引入於外爭以求宣泄。則必激成內亂。要之凡諸願慮。盡爲一部分自私自利卑怯心理之表現。吾知政府今日决不再爲此種心理所左右也。</p>
<p>近來事實所給與吾人之教訓。其一·則日內瓦我方甫表示較强硬之主張。國聯已略變其一味遷就日人之態度。其二·則𤍠河將領方作拒敵之準備。日人即暫延其取𤍠之野心。於此吾人當可知引起中國全民族之鬥爭、不特爲列强所不願。抑亦爲日人之所不敢。破壞整個中國之市場。於列强固爲重大之損失。而日本實爲主要之損失者。敵人之弱點既明。自處之　自易。吾人有須公然昭告於世界者。則當此忍無可忍之際。吾人爲圖存計。非引起全國對日之抗爭。實不足以救中國之危亡與崩潰。惟我有沉舟破釜之决心。乃能冀日人之悟、其非計。乃能冀列强之加以援手。對外之鬥爭既起。民族之威力自張。貪廉懦立。全國之財力物力。可悉供國家之徵取。疑釋嫌消。全國之兵力人力。可盡集於抗日之戰線。貧困艱苦。在戰時將視爲當然。游勇閑民在戰時皆可供驅使老大之民族。非此無以振奮。混亂之社會。非此無以澄清。中華民國一線之生機。即在於此。時乎不再。國人其圖之。</p>

<h3>美國海軍總長反對減少軍費</h3>
<p>全體海軍軍官擁護</p>
<p>國民十一日華盛頓電　今日美參衆兩院海軍委員會委員、皆謂達東之紛擾狀况、顯爲促成海軍總長亞丹士向國會急迫提議不能削弱美國作戰力量之動機、亞丹士今日致函參議員平漢與白林士、聲稱倘現方提出參衆兩院之撙節方案爲國會所通過、則美海軍實力將減至成爲全部出勤之日本海軍實力百方之五六、英海軍實力百分之六十六、</p>
<p>按參院近已通過撙節法修正案、規定政府各部院連海陸兩部在内、核減原預算日分之五、亞丹士聲稱、此案將迫海軍停閉東海岩若干船塢、滯緩造船工程、並使造艦所雇職工解僱多人、苟各院不重行考慮、則廢閒軍艦將達八十二艘、</p>
<p>此外結果則將使海軍後備隊之活動大受限制、海軍新兵停止招募、海軍常備兵額减少九千人、廢閒戰鬥船三艘、航空母艦二艘·重巡洋艦四艘·輕巡洋艦二艘·驅逐艦十三艘·潛艇六艘·輕埋雷艦二艘、即新造之大飛船、或者亦需於編入隊伍之後、立即擱置不用、目下美國廢閒之艦、因撙節結果、已達四十九艘、渠信現有編隊各艦不能再令廢閒云云、</p>
<p>據稱、亞丹士此舉得全體海軍軍官之擁護、而海軍上級官長與若干國會議員、皆信欲保國家之安全、不能再行撙節海軍經費、</p>
<p>至亞丹士此案、因撙節法修正案、僅在參議院通過、希望阻止國會加以最後通過、惟亞氏之意、祇須將海軍經費作爲例外、不受滅削可矣、但上星期四參院內會有此種企圖、未獲通過云、</p>
<h3>黷武主義不回頭！世界大戰不可免乎</h3>
<p>日本軍閥决定擴充海陸軍計劃</p>
<p>荒木欲使日軍戰鬥力等於西方</p>
<p>摩根促美國注意遠東危機</p>
<p>國民十一日派恩赫斯特電　美國前駐土爾其大使摩根、爲紐約著名實業與金融領袖、今夜在此間演說、謂牽涉東方與西方之世界大戰、顯似無可避免、此種戰機目下正在醖釀之中、此時全世界最大之潛藏危機、美國亟應注意、法德緊張情緒、或將引起重大衝突、希特勒總理前進過猛、隨時可以蹴及法人之趾、日本已在滿洲火藥箱內燃一火柴、隨時足以牽動全世界作一血戰、國家野心含有擴張領土成分在內、固是危險之事、但昔日強大之國家、企圖復興、亦未嘗不含危機、日本人在遠東欲與英國比賽、成一世界帝國、其侵犯中國領土、乃欲比擬英國擁有印度之志願所促成云云、至摩根對於目下解决滿案之努力、雖告加以藐視、但謂一俟公衆覺安全可期輿論冷淡之後、大衝突易於復啟、故此時對於滿洲與遠東之事、應加以研究與密切注意云、</p>
<p>（東京通訊）陸相荒木近於答覆衆院某議員問話時、作甚可注意之言論、謂其政策、在使日本陸軍效率不遜於西方國任何陸軍　欲達此目的、渠擬用全國實業能力、以完全其設備云、同時又謂原定陸軍補充計劃、需費五萬三千萬元、嗣循政府之志願、此數减爲四萬一千萬元、分一九三三與一九三四年及一九三四與三五年之兩個年度中籌付云、</p>
<p>荒木所稱欲使日本陸軍效率等於西方任何軍隊一禹、似有特殊意味、當此財政顧慮未許軍費稍增之時、而有實行補充陸軍之决議、其怵於蘇俄二次五年計劃中所定之軍事效率也、當無疑義、</p>
<p>以西方陸軍標準察之、日本陸軍在器械的設備上尚覺落後、因器械之不充分、而訓練遂亦瞠乎人後、雖體力軍紀與士氣、皆不遜於他國軍隊、但日本參謀部現覺情勢今漸迅變、蓋在一九三一年九月間滿洲事變以前、日本以爲日軍所須對抗者、非爲訓練不精·紀律不良·供給不全之中國陸軍、即爲戰力亦不良好之俄軍、故日本軍事當局、不願過於模仿西方陸軍之最新訓練與設備、但在滿洲事變及蘇俄製定二次五年計劃後、日本軍事當道不能不慮及將來在交通逐漸發達之區域、與最新式陸軍對敵之可能性矣、此非謂將來日俄戰爭必不可免、但日本參謀部不得不預防及此、以備萬一、此日本之所以有實施擴充陸軍計劃之决議也、（路透）</p>

<h3>主席報告</h3>
<p>主席馬良致開會詞云、諸位同志、諸位同胞、諸位敎胞、本日滬上敎胞、及各界、舉行追悼安營長德馨、及全營殉難烈士大會、追想榆城之役、安營長指揮全營官兵、以步兵一營、力抗强敵兩旅、並重砲空軍、誓死不屈之忠義、慷慨之氣、可與上海大戰蔡將軍以次諸位將領軍士名揚於天下矣、此就是給後來救國同胞作一相當模範、當此國難嚴重時期、於此追悼大會席上、愈覺得吾們中華民族、有特殊愛國精神、有自强自决力爭自由平等本能、救國决心、前有十九路軍及第五軍、後有安營長全營官長軍士愛國犧牲、我們當自信有這樣壯氣、收復失地、保我國土、發場國光、亦甚易易、據由榆城來魯避難人民詳述當時榆城作戰情形云、安營長當開戰時、誥誡部下曰、吾人旣作軍人、</p>
<p>即是以身許國的人、吾們軍人的前程、要在死路上求遠大、吾們軍人到戰場上、希望生還、算不了軍人、死在戰場上、要想留下整屍首、算不了軍人、我們軍人、能不畏犧牲性命、這才呌以身許國、盡軍人天職、才不負人民血汗餉需、國家的委任、吾們這次防守榆關縣城、敵人妄想進占縣城、除非吾們全部戰死、由我屍首上走進來、要不然、即剩下一官一卒、亦不能讓他進來、云云、以此種種觀之、安營長之勇敢犧牲、守土報國忠心、實在令人可敬、又據避難人民云、榆城敵人數倍於我、連戰數日、終以衆寡懸殊、敵人飛機炸破城牆、大砲轟毀城門、以致敵人衝入城內、發生巷戰、安營長命令官兵、以武術技能、刀槍並用、與敵人打成一團、四面受敵、飲食全無、遂致全營死難、其時榆城回民、知安營長戰死、多奮不顧身、奔入火線、在戰場內、將安營長屍首搶出、觀安營長榆城之役、全營官兵、同時死難、戰死之後、榆城回民、搶出屍首、於此可見其報國愛民良好表徵也、廻憶日本大地震後、吾全國上下、爭相救濟、不遺餘力、不料我國適値大災之時、日本竟忘却同文同種唇齒相依之誼、不但不行救災䘏鄰之道、反而乘我之危、强佔東北、進犯淞滬、又破榆關、看其侵略情形、大有不可理喻、無所底止之勢、將來非但中日兩國痛受凶殘戰禍、日本若不趕快覺悟、必致引起世界大戰、使全球人類同受殘殺之苦、其險惡有不堪言喻者、不然、日本若眞不顧世界人道公理、侵略我中華、我華人人均有拚死救國之决心、豈能作高麗台灣之繼、如去年一二八日軍欲佔領上海、擾亂長江、因蔡廷鍇將軍及第十九路軍第五軍諸將校軍士之奮勇抗戰、竟以一當百、拚戰月餘、此一月間之戰事、我軍將士、均奮不顧身、决心殺敵、日軍幾乎無法進攻、全軍覆沒、日軍器械雖利、而我能摧堅破壘、百戰百勝、全由我軍訓練有方、愛國熱血所激動、所謂完全以决死精神勝敵也、今者安營長死難榆關之慘烈、亦何嘗不是訓練有素、激於義憤、愛國熱血所激動呢、安營長戰死、固然爲國家人才可惜、不過他之死、乃久經訓練出來的、况回敎民族、因篤信宗敎、對於與敵人作戰、均是以死爲榮、視死如歸的、如以前有甲午之役、左老將軍在平壤與日軍抗戰殉難、亦是寡不敵衆戰死、係全局皆破、今安營長與之前後媲美、精神一貫、鄙人致力武術敎育四十餘年、所有一般生徒部下、遍滿全國、能如安營長之高尚品格、武術精强、犧牲愛國、不畏强敵者、尙不知有多少也、當此嚴重國難之秋、我全國同志同胞、旣有滬戰蔡將軍、與第五軍將校軍士、榆戰安營長官長士兵、給我們作下抗敵模範、全國同志同胞具必死之决心、誓與强敵抵抗到底、認定迫於死地而後生的原則、作繼續滬戰榆戰將領官兵前進、恢愎我們國家版圖的完整、保障我們建國的三民主義、實有無限之厚望也、</p>

<h3>張之江詞</h3>
<p>中央國術館長張之江演詞、略云、安營長殉國矣、今日吾人在此開會追悼、抑僅出於崇拜之心理歟、抑亦於崇拜之外、另發生一種後死之責之感想歟、國難當頭、吾人惟有拼死、始足以挽救、安營長爲國死、吾人亦當爲國死、惟當研究死者之法而已、如自衛而死、則死眞其所矣、總理有言、有自衛能力方能生存、故無論男女老幼、均當奮鬥自衛、以圖生存、抗日戰死、死重泰山、國難紓解、國恥灡洗、不在國聯而在自己自衛、不圖自衛而聞國聯形勢轉佳、即喜自滿、此種依賴之心、終必至於自誤云云、</p>

<h3>全浙公會主張中日關稅恊定期滿失效</h3>
<p>不必宣告取銷更無修正必要</p>
<p>亦且不可續訂平等互惠約定</p>
<p>上海全浙公會昨致外財兩部電云、南京國民政府行政院外交部財政部均鑒、報載中日關稅協定、中央已令外財兩部會同研究該協定不平等各點、向日方提出修正等語、查中日關稅協定不平等各點、在換文附件、不在協定正文、各商業團體、紛請取銷者、即該協定附件所載之互惠條欵、按附表所列輕稅商品、我方所占數量不及日方百分之一、名爲互惠、實則日掌其利、我蒙其害、當時外財兩部、欲求關稅自主、不惜犧牲鉅利、以爲交換、原具不得已之苦衷、幸而有效其間、祇限三年、今屆期滿、當然失其效力、無宣告取銷之必要、更無修正之理由、蓋關稅互惠協定、歐美國際間彼此親善之國、嘗有此舉、然在日人武力侵略狀態之下、一方請國聯對之、加以制裁、一方自身與其重訂關稅互惠協定、表示親善態度、此種矛盾政策、不特貽笑世界、且淆國際心理、是故不平等協定、國宜拒絕、即平等之互惠、</p>

<h3>榮宗敬談購美澳麥原因</h3>
<p>云係不得已之故</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨爲美麥來華一事、特往訪麵粉業領袖榮宗敬氏、據談、此次南美洲阿根廷之麥來華、係由於澳麥在華傾銷、美麥大受影響、故不惜貶價出售、出與競爭、本市購進者、據報載係二萬二千噸、實係三萬噸、採購外麥之動機、完全因我國去年麥產太少、較之往年、不足十分之三、實不足以供需要、若不購進外麥、全市粉廠、必將無工可做、現該三萬噸麥、預期五月左右、可以到滬、但抵華以後、照本市市場銷路、最多應付三個月、價格係三兩三錢半、至於美麥之優點、一·係乾燥耐久、一·係酵性較足、故此種情形、並非商人貪小、實出於不得已、中國生產品之不好、亦屬無可諱言、是以本人曾一再向宋子文部長建議、盡力設法改革、俾使出品優良、生產加增、若長此以往、必將益見慘落、僅就本年華北而言、所用麥粉、皆屬日貨、若一旦平津情形突變、不再購外麥預爲接濟、則華北糧食、必生問題、故此次採購美澳麥、其原因亦即在此、至於美麥賒借停止原因、係由美國農民、亦不充裕、故美政府雖願賒於我國、乃以此故、必須現金購買、我國無此財力、祇得停止云云、</p>

<h3>出家與還俗</h3>
<p>│復昨日姜信女士來信│</p>
<p>答：來信所問各條略復如左！㈠『出家人是有益於國家社會的,抑是有損於國家社會的呢?』這一問題應該這樣地提出;宗敎是有益於國家社會的.抑是有損於國家社會的呢?因爲所謂出家人,在中國就是和尙道士和尼姑,就是佛敎和道敎的信徒。要想知道這種信徒是否有益於國家社會，那就不得不先問這種宗敎本身有益抑有害。我們的答復是！有百害而無一利，也可以說，於少數人有利，於多數人有害：於壓迫者有利，於被壓迫者有害　于剝削者有利，于被剝削者有害。我們在這裏極力避免宗敎的發生及其理論問題之繁複的討論，只從歷史的研究上抽出如下的結論·（一）宗敎是不平等社會中的少數統治者利用之以麻醉大多數被統治者的意識的鴆毒或鴉片　（二）宗敎是剝削與壓迫者用以緩和被剝削和被壓迫者之反抗的，敵視的心情的工具：（三）宗敎是一般有閒階級的消遣品：（四）宗敎是掛着普渡衆生的慈悲的面孔，實則是人類之萬惡的淵藪；（五）宗敎是戕賊人性，達反自然法則的東西。由此，可知出家人是害於國家社會的而不是有益於國家社會的。㈡出家人之出家也，大半爲的是沒有飯吃或因爲父母所施捨，這兩種皆是生活問題而不是什麼名譽問題。你出家的時候，並非爲名譽而來；這還俗的時候。也並非爲什麼名譽而去。不但普通所謂和尙尼姑一類出家人之一出一入，無關什麼名譽，即中國士大夫之以居士自號者，其對於所持戒律，亦皆視若敝屣。合肥蒯若木是以精通內典，淨修居士業著名者，然而其罷官而居也則講佛以要譽，一朝官運亨通，則又將佛典置諸高閣，亡友某君曾以詩謔之曰；『身無餘地是長安，萬事如灰正寒；車耳黃塵深一尺，入門作佛出門官！』這一首詩眞洞澈了　國的佛敎居士（等而下之，出家人亦在內）的骨髓！我們現正式答復你第二問題：『出家人還俗』絕不是一件不名譽的事，不但不是一件不名譽的事，並且是一件極名譽的事。爲什麼呢？和尙道士尼姑在社會的事業上，只是一種贅疣，好吃懶做，奘勵人類惰性，人之可恥，孰逾于是。現在你脫離了這種消極的空門而重新走到積極的人生之路，這就是表現你有一種積極的奮鬬精神，便是極名譽的事。㈢出家人還俗絕不要先得師父的同意，應當自由决定：因爲師父總是把徒弟視若自己的私有物！壓迫和剝削的對像，絕不會同意，徒弟脫離他的羈絆去還俗的；若果要得師父同意，那就萬達不到還俗的目的。㈣師徒之間，在徒弟的自由還俗這一點上，我們敢說是絕無法律的關係。㈤『師父不願徒弟還俗，因而尋死，』那只怪　自己願死，</p>
<p>與徒弟何干？我想民國絕不會有這種滑稽的法律，來以師父此等死法，周納徒弟的罪名，科徒弟以不該自由還俗致逼殺師父的刑罰。㈥你要還俗只須正式通知師父一聲或在律師處存案，便不是私逃，至於師父許可與否，那簡直不成問題。㈦你自由還俗，是你的自由權。你家庭父兄是　負責任的，你師父去向你父兄要人，讓他要去，管　則甚！</p>

<h3>仁義與律法</h3>
<p>— 元慶</p>
<p>在表面上看來「仁義與律法」似乎是屬馬牛不相及吧？其實；仁義與律法同樣是一種道德，同樣的可以範　人心。然而仁義是用以「化民」的，律法是用以「畏民」的，兩者雖則是同一種的道德，而「化民」與「畏民」便判若　　！　　假如我們以律法去治理人民的話，那末：毫無煩疑的│人民祇曉得自己　於罪惡的深淵裏，却終究不知道悔過遷善，而踏到「棄暗就明」的康荘大道上去，祇是挖苦了一般罪而受刑，刑而重罪的芸芸衆生而已，祇是　啟了一般人民的怨忿，釀成了國家的後患而已！</p>
<p>我們再把古代的歷史打開來看：就可以曉得秦朝的敗亡，是敗於律法的　峻同時也可以知道夏禹的善於治國，便是拿仁義去範　人心的原因！現在│在這二十世紀新潮流正在澎湃，舊道德止在淪亡的時代，│人心早已澆薄，早就不知道仁義爲何物？於是乎一般貪婪無厭的强盜土匪，流氓癟三，都置仁義於不顧，到處擄掠財帛，到處殺人放火，律法的威嚴給毀滅了，世道從此衰微了！</p>
<p>所以；現在一般熟諳政治的當道諸公，都要拿嚴　刑法去治他們的罪，都希望他們快些脫離罪惡而來歸。</p>
<p>殊不如律法愈加嚴厲，人心便愈變愈毒，因此：人民祇曉得５於律法，却不能拿仁義來自治，還有甚麼希望？</p>
<p>假如我們拿仁義的道德云感化他，敎導他，那末；老實說了吧！││人心都是肉做的，一旦仁義的感化力，深入人心！那一個不會幡然改過？那一個不會踏５「葉暗就明」的康荘大道上去？雖然說：律法與仁義同樣是一種不可偏廢的道德。</p>
<h3>趕快捉拿捲逃</h3>
<p>— 庸子</p>
<p>│務要人贓並獲│</p>
<p>除了社會主義的國家，一切私有財產，沒收充公之外，帝國，王國，民主國，共和國，不拘怎一種制度的國，總不能取締伊的人民擁有家產。因了這一種關係，於是每一個國家，都訂有一種法律，呌做所有權。譬如說，我有一個祖傳的乾隆窰便壺，是一件希世之寶，特地配着一個紅木座子，供在天然儿上，當做一種擺設。這一個便壺，雖然在祖宗的遺囑上，沒有明白註明，在當地政府，也沒有具呈備過案，但是這便壺是我家傳家之寶，是任何人都不反對的。一旦這個希世之寶的乾隆窰便壺，被聶手聶脚的賊伯伯偷了去，或是被明火執仗的强盜搶了去，或是被小老婆跟着東隔壁的矮子拆白捲逃了去，那麼，祇須到公安局報告一聲。終有一日人贓並獲，把乾隆窰便壺，物歸原主的。這就是證明這便壺的所有權是屬於我，他人不能佔有，除非是我不肖，立一張賣杜絕的契據，把所有權讓人　　關於東北的三省，或是日本人所說的滿蒙不成問題，是我們整個中國的一部，從沒有人道遇半個不字，就是不遠千里而來的李頓老先生，也有一句，說一句的承認東北與中國，在歷史上，地理上，都是不能脫離關係的，這就十足道地的證明了東北的所有權，是屬於中國的。在目前，這一塊寶藏，極富的土地，雖給小老婆捲逃了去，總有一天要人贓並獲，物歸原主的。但是所怕的，就是日子一躭擱，一切東西，已給拆白變</p>
<p>錢花用完了，雖然捉到了人，無法吊贓，那幾是糟糕呢。</p>
<h3>廢物利用</h3>
<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>│可作侵略的工具│</p>
<p>自從不知道那一位先生，發明了「廢物」可以「利用」以來，天地間便無所謂「廢物」了。</p>
<p>本來「廢物利用，」原是一種最妙的經濟辦法。不過·自己有了「廢物，」既不知利用，又不知棄去，卻把它留下來，給人家攫去利用，這是最冤枉，而且是最可嘆的事情！現在我覺得不僅「物，」是這樣。就是「人，」也何嘗不是這樣？</p>
<p>我們知道，一個人五官百體俱全，飯既吃得下，屎也拉得出·自然，是一個康健有用的人、然而·又安知世間有種人，表面上，五官白體，並無殘缺，似乎可以說是康健有用的人了。但是，實際上，做出來的事情·却毫無心肝！試想一個人，沒有了心肝，如何還可說是康健有用的人？既不能說是康健有用的人·自然，不是「廢物」是什麼？</p>
<p>雖然，「廢物」可以「利用，」這種「廢物」似的人，也何嘗不可以利用？所以，我們見了這種「廢物似的人，雖則氣惱，然而，人家却在那裏求之不得，不勝歡迎！</p>
<p>現在別的不去說他，就拿東北的「漢奸」來說羅：他們的五官百體，一樣俱全，每天吃飯拉屎，也一樣「靈光，」表面上，似乎都是康健有用的人。然而，實際上他們都是沒有心肝的「廢物！」　　唉！這許多「廢物，」只爲我們自己既不能利用，又不知棄去，留到如今，却給人家在那裏利用了來，作侵略的工具，豈不冤枉？豈不可欸？</p>

<p>— 郭長溥</p>
<p>摩登女士們的經濟學真高妙，試看伊們在嚴寒的冬季，仍舊穿着單的綢旗袍，便可以知道一斑了。　　友人某說，他在電車上所以不離坐於女人的原故，是因爲中國女人們的體格太弱，使伊們立着，或可轉弱爲强。</p>

<h3>混江龍的奇遇</h3>
<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>沒有女人，也沒有孩子：好！自己賣得魚市，買一壺酒，像在楊家灣那時多麼好！偏鬼魔，姘了這潑寡婦，要買胭脂，搽香粉對別人作俏。呸！妖怪！老子算瞎了眼，撞見這臭貨！」這夜深人靜的時候，他是帶了被酒精燒旺了的憤怒，走出來扠些魚，預備明天上巿集去的。可是一想到今天那婦人帶了孩子逃到不知去向，而自己才安靜的喝一點酒，這是意事情倒不覺破。狠罵之後，心情很恬靜很舒快了。以後應該過一個自在自由的像從前一樣的獨個生活，他想。</p>
<p>於是嘲笑自己去年的某一個春天的深夜偷偷地躲進寡婦的臥房去用怎樣的金錢買得了伊的溫柔的媚笑……。然而這使他的平靜的心暫時又波起熱暖的印象。不過爲了恨那婦人的固執的心理太深，正像湖水一樣，風過後馬上又靜止了。</p>
<p>他這醉飽了的身軀，終於給帶到凌家浜的大榆樹下來了。這榆樹的禿枝上，幾點黑，是烏雅的宿巢，月光裏可以看得很淸楚。凌家浜的水啞默着，亮得像銀子。　　照例先放下手裏的魚叉，然後魚網。他又抬起頭來，本能地看了一眼天，「好月色，發個利巿，給老子多扠幾條大魚來，」他心裏神秘地祈禱著。又咂咂留賸在唇上的酒瀝。暫時遺棄了一切痛苦的思想。</p>
<p>然而夜是那樣靜，只有風刮着偃息的水草，凄凄密密地微響，凌家浜附近的村荘，都被埋在水一樣的月光裏，夢一樣的灰黑。他偶然打一個乾咳，響得激動了浜底下的凉魚，在水裏輕輕地游。水面上也連起了渾圓或鯉魚斑的銀波。</p>
<p>這是他睜大醉眼來探覓『魚之巢穴』的機會了。他很迅捷的重復挪起白鐵魚叉，魚叉的白鐵發出幾縷搖曳不定的亮光。他走近浜岸，幽手幽脚地；潛伏在臨岸的蘆花５裏，像５狗一樣的尖起了耳，鶴一樣的伸長了頸，鷹眼也同時加倍的發着嚴重注視的光㈡</p>
<h3>潮流中</h3>
<p>— 女杰</p>
<p>│只有游魚最善應付潮流│</p>
<p>今天的江水，真是清明得異乎尋常，碧綠得像橄欖油似的。上游的潮流，源源的自東而向西，一條條的水紋，好像是抽不完的綠色絲線，偶而碰着了江中的暗礁，發出了一二聲二三聲斷斷續續的５５的音波，這是大自然在奏着音樂，這是昏天黑地伸手不見五指的社會中所特有的一片純潔光明的世外桃源。</p>
<p>你看！粉紅色的桃花瓣，平鋪在水面，還有紫綠色的浮萍，也站在那裏，伊們者是含着嬌羞，跟着那潮流走，一點也不快，一點也不慢，恰恰和那潮流一般的快慢，寸步不離，緊緊跟隨。</p>
<p>無疑地，跟着這樣美麗無比的潮流走是世界上最幸福不過的人了，無疑地，跟着潮流走是世界上最穩健不過的勾當了。所以，今天，那聰明的游魚，也趨向着潮流的方向，上前推進着。</p>
<p>今天的江水，是這樣的汚濁不淸，５５得令人可厭，一絲絲水紋中，有幾瓣毫無主見的桃花和那幾張身不由主的浮萍，很不自然隨着那潮流走着，但是，不見了那聰明的魚游。</p>
<p>今天的潮流是這樣的急迫，好像飛一般的流下去，可憐那桃花瓣被捲在漩渦過來。</p>
<p>你看暗礁來了，桃花瓣和浮萍碰將下去，有的是碰得粉身碎骨，有的是碰得頭破血流，也有的被僥倖流過，……只有，那游魚，那聰明的游魚，在從容小迫中慢慢行來。</p>
<h3>婦女在婚姻上的樂觀</h3>
<p>— 慧珠女士</p>
<p>俗語道得好：「家和萬事興」這話最有道理。我不喜歡聽人家說，一個家庭會有什麼不和眭的事，但是世界之大，社會之衆，其中就有多少怨偶演出許多薄倖的故事，和離婚的悲劇！</p>
<p>所謂「前車之覆」，「後車之鑒」；社會上充滿了「郎是薄倖」，「夫也不良」的論調。在小說上深刻的描寫，舞台上動情的表演，竟使一般女子視婚姻爲畏途，嫁人好像是一椿很不幸的事；你傳我，我傳伊，直到現在，各人的腦子裏，都充滿種種恐怖的現象。</p>
<p>要是女子都能明白一切，夫婦間便决不會變成怨偶了。</p>
<p>確賞是世界上决沒有一對夫妻不喜歡家庭和睦的，自然是不應當有尊夫卑妻的制度，更不必反的過來有什麼河東獅吼。無論如何，夫妻間凡事切不可認真，做妻子的不必見了丈夫的影子。就會駭怕，做妻子的也不可對於丈夫無竭的猜疑是非。</p>
<p>結婚確實是件樂事，你若是踏進了戀愛的途徑中，你看男人們便會發狂似的愛着你，慇懃地待着你，很愼重地雙方訂婚，結婚，神仙一般，是多們甜蜜，多們快樂，你們想寵，在蜜月中的幸福，　是眞幸福呢！</p>
<p>枕邊細語，寒暖溫存，眞是天上人間，無雙　樂的快事！試看一對新夫婦，比肩並坐，情話喁喁，羨煞了旁觀的人衆，在你們呢，祗順着山誓海盟，同枝連理，這個時候，也許是目空一切，旁若無人的了。</p>
<p>結婚之愛，這愛情固然算是快樂，但是結了婚，便算是得了一個忠實的終身伴侶。患難相從，知已知彼，但是同時雙方在愛情之外，仍要「相敬如賓，相愛如友」。你們看見過沒有？許多和睦恩愛的老夫妻們，他們是如何荘重的態度！所謂同心同情。也並不是單單注意在風情之間，「忠實誠懇」倒是不可缺少的態度。</p>
<p>夫婦的前途，廣遠得很，結婚僅僅是人生的初步，要是凡事能在事後迴想起來，很有許多事會使你自己啞然失笑的。這確確實實我可以說，婚姻是人生的大快事，尤其是我們女子！</p>
<p>有許多盼望着生孩子的，見着人家爹爹抱着，媽媽提着，滿口的毛病着：「壁人佳兒，可　雙福」！羨慕不止！</p>
<p>那麼社會上傳說的，小說裏描寫的，舞台上表演的，這許多許多「人間怨偶」，「家庭悲劇」，未必盡是事實罷。</p>

<h3>上海巿近十年來醫藥鳥瞰（續）</h3>
<p>— 龐京周</p>
<p>中國的慈善家，假使出資辦院，很少肯不問信的，並且於用人方面，不能確守「用者莫疑，疑者莫用」的態度，甚而至於拿醫院當作官廳一般看待，往往由董事硬交八行書給醫務主任，今天介紹一個練習看護，明天介紹一個掛號先生，就是茶役廚司，也有從院長董事方面來的，結果則董事自己看看，說我們這醫院，爲什麼不如外國人的醫院？終覺得不愜意，要知道眞正合格的醫院裏·應該上自醫師，下至院役，皆有另一種醫的訓練，試看他們醫院內的問訊處都是饒有訓練的看護當的，北平協和醫院內，連文牘主任，也用醫師中文筆好的人去當，自然沒有不相宜的地方了。假如我們辦一個草創的醫院，而出次最多的院董，是一個前淸候補道等等，難免有厘卡上扞手，來當掛號先生，於是他那副尊容，對待病家，就不甚好看，而醫院的名譽，在這些小节　也受了影響。</p>
<p>我這許多議論，未免明於責人，昧於責已，所以反過來要說，我們醫界裏對於辦理醫院的人材，也實在不多。推原其故，凡是習醫的人，因爲對於將來的出處，大都以個人開業，或研究專鬥基本科學爲目標，所以祇在各科學理，和技術上用功夫，决不肯於醫院的設備與管理方面，另留番心，即使有在外國多年，經許多醫院實習，而隨時留意的，究竟極少數。若在本國習醫的，更因自己所處的地方，已經不是一個大規模而井井有條的醫院，而愈覺沒有師承了。就是那少數抱有管理醫院有天才的和少數平日對於辦醫院有志願而留心研究的，或是醫家而富有幹才的幾位，亦必然消納到以下幾處去：㈠自己私辦的療養院；㈡小規模私立醫院；㈢絕對有條理而整潔的診所。而以上三項，又往往在社會上佔着優勝，於是辦理公立醫院的人材，乃覺得愈乏，所以我們在上海，可以看見較好的私立醫院，而缺乏較好的公立醫院，並且有時公立醫院的主持者，還要抱着舊商人或官廳的腦筋，用人每取薄薪主義，寧可讓聯員另行作弊的。但是醫院豈是有弊可作的地方？醫師豈是准許作弊的人物？於是公立醫院的醫務主任，便隨着這種習慣，而成爲淸苦差缺，有幹才而富學問的人，旣有私立醫院可辦，又有好好的診所可以開業，誰復在薪水薄而責任重大之下，來當　苦差呢？鄙人經手辦過醫院，在自己義務指導之下，用個人的交誼，請來月薪二百元的醫務主任，還是個外國大學畢業而得博士學位的，可以算得價廉物美了。然而到醫院經費缺乏的時候，董事的口吻。似乎尙嫌醫薪太貴，而我則一方面要顧慮醫師的生活，一方面要仰體董事的心理而勉强維持他們的興趣，又一方面要加重我自己的義務責任，而不使醫務的效能減少，夾在中間做煞難人，不過爲了公立醫院爲巿上所需要，不惜委曲求全，勉强賣力而已。</p>

<h3>（九）妊娠時的衛生</h3>
<p>— 兪松筠</p>
<p>妊娠最初的三個月，及最後的三個月，是爲自覺痛苦最多顯明的兩個時期，在妊娠初期，每於早晨，感有不快，且患噁心，嘔吐，食慾不振，流涎，咽酸，尿意頻仍，神經等痛。</p>
<p>妊娠末期，因子宮擴大，每起器械的障碍，例如：運動障碍，失眠，腹壁緊張，下肢浮腫，静脈瘤，胃障碍等。</p>
<p>凡遇痛苦厲害時，固不可不施相當之處理，但不甚劇烈時，切不可妄投藥劑，因妊娠本屬生理的作用，所以妊婦最好不要變更平常的生活，而且妊娠衛生第一要點，就是無論何事，不可過度，應行注意各點，分述如下：</p>
<p>㈠禁忌…過度運動，小腹凍冷，腹壓，傷風，腸胃障碍等，乘人力車馬車汽車火車汽船等長途旅行，階梯昇降，騎馬舉重，伸手高處，冷水浴，海水浴，脚浴，坐浴，舞蹈，坐立過久，長時洗濯等等，以上均在禁忌之列。</p>
<p>㈡飲食…飲食物宜擇其易於消化而富於滋養的東西，各物均須適度，雖不必强改平常的習慣，但對於不易消化，平常不慣，以及含有烈性的食物，例如：芥辣胡椒山芋等，切不可濫用，又如含有剌激性的酒類濃茶咖啡等，亦須忌用爲妥，更要注意的，在妊娠後半期，切不可飽食。</p>
<p>㈢衣服…衣服因氣候而異，但以寬大，不碍胸腹，且適於保溫者，最爲相宜，另用廣闊的棉布或絨布，輕輕包紮腹部，其目的是保持溫度，固定胎位，切不可緊縛。</p>
<p>㈣運動…妊婦不可不有適宜的運動，譬如：戶外散步，　　新鮮空氣，仰望天空，在日光下洗浴，可使精神爽快，若在家庭照料家務，亦未始不可，但亦須適可而止，嚴禁舞蹈騎馬舉重長途旅行激烈運動等事。</p>
<p>㈤通便…若患便秘，宜速整調，并宜適度運動，每晨稍飲冷水或冷牛乳，每天在一定時間，必須通便一次，使成習慣，每飯後稍進水果，如仍無效，再用肥皂水或甘油灌腸法，或給以緩下劑，但切不可用劇烈的瀉藥，以免流產之患。</p>
<p>㈥小便…小便一事，亦須常常注意，并須時時檢查，對於蛋白尿，更須格外注意，在妊娠初期，就該預防蛋白質的潴積，因此往往易罹妊娠子宮向後屈曲之患故也。</p>
<p>㈦淸潔…妊娠須隨時入浴，因外陰部分泌過多，以致汚穢不潔，最好用溫水，時常洗滌，但不可坐浴洗脚，恐有流產之患。</p>
<p>㈧乳房…乳頭發育不良，或陷沒者，宜常以淸潔的指頭，設法舉出，每日必須用淸水或酒精，輕拭乳頭。</p>
<p>㈨精神…妊婦必須安靜，初妊婦或曾經難產而有恐怖之念者，最好時時安慰，以免精神受若，一切激動情感之事，以及小說戲劇等等，皆不可近身親歷，睡眠必須充分，心神不可太勞。</p>
<p>㈩房事…自受胎後，槪宜限制房事，在妊娠後半期，更須嚴禁。</p>
<p>總之，妊娠中的衛生，須從日常習慣之無碍於妊娠經過者做去，雖無更改的必要，但是精神及身體的激烈變調，當然是極力避免的好，尤其是日常飲食通便睡眠等事，都應注意而調節之。</p>
<h3>藥物作用說（下）</h3>
<p>— 愚公</p>
<p>不特此也。舊時醫者。往往因藥物之形狀。顏色。及氣味之不同。而妄猜其功用。在中國以人參爲百病靈藥。然人參種類頗多。形態不一。據云。以類似人形者爲貴。五參五色即配五臟。故人參入脾曰黃參。沙參入肺曰白參。玄參入腎曰黑參。牡蒙入肝曰紫參。丹參入心曰赤參。顏色不同。功用即異。充類至盡。不一而足。無怪牛溲馬勃。敗鼓之皮。可以兼收並蓄。而中國本草。乃成爲洋洋巨著矣。</p>
<p>上述種種。非獨中國爲然。即在歐西亦屬如此。在第二世紀加倫（Ｇａｌｅｎ）時代。藥物之多。已足驚人。關於製藥之書計三十卷。治療之書計十四卷。至十六及十七世紀。藥物種類。更形繁夥。分載于藥制。製藥書。及方書者。不下六千餘種。當時給藥方法。一如中國之今日。每劑中含有十餘種不同之品。非獨醫師對於各藥混和後之作用。莫明其妙。即各藥之單獨效能。亦屬全然不曉。直至十八世紀末葉。及十九世紀之初。醫學進步。始有長足之進展。培養細菌。乃知傳染病之媒介。病理解剖。乃知臨床診斷之是否確切。診斷治療方法。日加精密。已往迷信。一掃而空。嚮之以六千餘藥治療者。今乃視爲野蠻舉動。而各種藥品。先在動物體中。如狗。如貓。如兔。如嗬囒猪。試其功效。騐其毒性。然後再施于人類。試舉最普通用藥如洋毛地黃以例證之。距今約一百五十年前。英國式老式地方（ｓｈｒｏｐｓｈｉｅｏ）有一老嫗。藏有秘方。內含數種藥品。可治水腫。其功效在當時爲任何藥物所不及。該方展轉流傳。至英國醫師威靈威斯令之手。經其考察。發現該方中各樣藥品。惟有一種爲治水腫之特效者。而此一種。即爲毛地黃。於是威靈費十年之力。凡病人患水腫者。悉以毛地黃治之。積十年經騐。著成專書。對於毛地黃之效能。及給予病人之劑量。作有系統之記載。然後毛地黃爲治水腫有效藥。乃能確定。然威氏仍如藏方之嫗。明用而不明其體。知其然而不知其所以然。其原因爲威氏所得之結果。僅由經騐。而不由學理。故亦未能澈底。其從經多數科學家。作動物試騐後。個中疑團。始能打破。于是知毛地黃所以能治水腫者。乃由于間接使心臟跳躍緩而且强也。</p>
<p>此種發明。可云經騐開其始。實騐促其成。於是藥理學尙已。醫生而不明藥理。是無異以病人爲試騐之具。荒謬孰甚。然洞明藥理。談何容易。請仍以毛地黃譬之。苟曰病人之患脚腫者。宜服毛地黃浸酒二竓。以半杯水稀釋之。每隔六小時服一次。即此單簡之藥方。已引起若干問題。其問題爲何以毛地黃能治脚腫。毛地黃之一般作用爲何。毛地黃在身體何種組織上起何種作用。毛地黃對於各種脚腫皆有效乎。何以口服而不注射之。何故稀釋之。何以每六小時而不曰每二小時或三小時乎。欲能一一解答。非認識藥理不可。生理不可。病理不可。于生理病理及藥理有相當之認識。始能用得其當。非然者。乃十八世紀以前之醫生。不足語于現代之醫藥也。</p>

<h3>談遺精</h3>
<p>成熟的男子，在兩性性交快感達到最高度的時候，發生著射精的一回事，這是人類繁殖上一個最重要的工作，但是沒有性交，在睡夢中發起陰莖勃起和射精，這就呌做遺精。遺精的回數是沒有一定的，有的一週一回或二回，有的二週一回，有的四週一回，總之或多或少，是隨著各人的體質和生活的狀況，是極不一定的。如果是已經結婚的男子，長久沒有性交，因爲精液的充滿，反射的在夜間引起射精，並　這樣的遺精，夜間多有猥褻的夢，翌日精神上和肉體上，均不感覺到任何樣的痛苦，或者反而覺到精神上的平靜。而且遺精的間隔，至少在一週以上，這樣的遺精，從醫學上的眼光看起來，實在不能當作病理的現象看，就是可　作爲生理的射精，所以肉體和精神健全的靑年男子，往往有遺精的一回事。</p>
<p>至於病理的遺精呢，那就不同了，第一是他發生的回數瀕繁，一週間發生幾回，甚至不但每夜遺精，就是在白晝也　時覺著陰莖的勃起，大便或小便的時候，運動步行的時候，舟車動搖的時候，衣服被褥接觸的時候，都發生精液的漏洩，更甚的時候，見着美貌的婦女和驚愕悲哀的時候，精神上受著感動，也可以發生遺精。這樣的重症遺精，病人的疲勞，可謂達到極點，就使不是這樣重的遺精，如果是多回反復的時候，病人也覺到倦怠而沒有氣力，記憶力和思考力都减退，發生頭痛頭重，耳鳴心悸，四肢怠倦和振顫，背部疼痛，精神朦朧，作事厭惡，憂鬰等種種症狀。</p>
<p>講到遺精的原因，除　面所講生理的遺精以外，發生病理遺精的原因很多；第一種是因神經衰弱而來的，譬如因房事過多，手淫，或因避孕的目的，在射精前中止交接，履次施行之後，引起性神經衰弱，更因性神經衰弱，引起遺經：第二是因泌尿器生殖器及其他隣近器管的疾病而發生遺精，譬如包莖，攝護　炎，攝護　肥大，慢性淋病，糖尿病，膀胱炎，膀胱結石，尿道狹窄，尿道炎等，種種疾病；第三是同爲神經系統的疾病，譬如脊髓病，脊髓炎，腦腫瘍等症病，此外一切的心身過勞，環境不良，生活不攝生等，都是發生遺精的原因。</p>
<p>遺精的治療和方法，遺精的原因，旣然有上面所講的幾種，所以如果要醫治遺精，第一要除去原因，這　要請醫師診斷和治療的，但　病　個人可行的方法和注意的地方也頗多，茲逐條的寫在下面，請大家注意罷。</p>
<p>㈠病人有手淫，房事過度和中止交接等事情的，應當翻然改悔，努力除去。</p>
<p>㈡避免心身的過勞，給以相當的休息，就須要有正規的生活方法才好。</p>
<p>㈢用毛巾濕冷水絞乾後，摩擦陰部和大腿的內面，逐日行之，倘不間斷的時候，往往有奇効。</p>
<p>㈣臨睡前應當節制飲料，因爲膀胱的充滿，是能夠引起遺精的。</p>
<p>㈤遺精最多的時候，要算在午夜後晨間四五分鐘，大多這個時候，膀胱充滿，要免却因爲膀胱充滿的遺精，不要貪睡，即刻起來小便一次，再行入睡。</p>
<p>㈥睡眠的時候，最好是屈着足側身而睡，因爲遺精的時候，多陰莖是勃起的，勃起的陰莖，一觸着褲子或被褥，就引起了射精。</p>
<p>㈦被褥不可太暖，尤以足部爲要，過暖了引起下半身的充血，是要發生遺精的。</p>
<p>㈧大便的閉結，能夠使生殖器充血，也要引起遺精，　以大便應當　日通順，</p>
<p>㈨誨淫的書籍圖書和電影，自然不應當看，</p>
<p>㈩刺戟性的飲食物，譬如酒，濃茶，咖啡等，均應當禁止才好，攝取淡泊的食物。</p>
<p>㈩㈠患遺精的人，還要有一種勇氣，不要過於害怕，想着今夜　是</p>
<p>要遺精的，這樣的思想，往往引起了幻夢，果然引起了遺精，所以要安然入睡，不要胡思亂想恐懼才好。</p>
<h3>肺病雜談（續）</h3>
<p>— 侯光迪</p>
<p>啖生牛肉。及生牛肉汁可治肺癆之說。發明於德國何烈二氏。而爲依丁堡城斐立魄氏所贊許。其原理謂肌肉組織。其其漿汁。能發生免癆性。遏止癆菌之在長。且　質輸入人體之增加與儲藏。足以催促織維質之化成。試之於犬。陡見奇效。但勃郎氏試之則犬反斃。後有專家拿立勃來司氏。詳細分晰斐氏學說。而其結論謂在初期肺癆啖之。確有特效。遲則稍遜。食者體重增加。脈搏和緩。而血壓見佳。肌肉較堅。體溫漸平。血色素加增。消化轉佳。漸愈患處。總之不論何種滋養。全以消化爲依歸。醫者切勿拘於成見。滅菌療法。分藥物的與注射鐵勃苦林兩種。第一種首推幾阿蘇之內服。此藥功效。或謂殺菌。或言助消化者。各持一說。故用頗廣。此藥亦可作蒸氣吸入。乾嗆多痰者。頗見功效。由幾阿蘇而產生之新藥甚多。如克利唵蘇它爾Creossotaic第安它爾Suotal其阿沙脫。Geossot古阿苦爾。Gualacol知阿苦爾。Tｈｉｏｃｏｌ雪羅林。Sｉｒｏｂｉｎ不下數十種。但效用均相類。餘者　劑砒劑。尿素劑。碘劑。安息香劑。等療法。曾見用一時。終致放棄。第二種療法開始於谷克氏。係將癆菌培養之毒液濾出。製成溶液。名鐵勃苦林。注射人體。去可增加原質內之抗毒體。而消滅癆菌與菌毒。共有三樣。用法。一脫洛第氏緩進法。由極微之注射量。而每隔三四日漸漸增加。以免去反動爲主觀。二反動法。注射一次之量。激起輕度之反動。使產生最大限度之抗毒體。三拉脫氏食菌指數法。（Ｏｐｓｃｎｉｃ　Iｎｄｅｘ　Mｅｈｏｄ）其用法照而液之食菌指數而注射之。三法中以緩進爲最佳。</p>
<p>注射鐵勃苦林。患者必具幾分之抵抗力。全身狀况尙佳者。爲合宣。凡肺部患處輕微。或病雖深入。因衛生療養。而不在進行期內。或病離遍佈。而全身狀况尙佳者。均可用鐵勃苦林治之。如體溫已高。逾一百度者。則不宜注射矣</p>
<h3>醫師的社會任務（一）</h3>
<p>— 范守淵</p>
<p>雖然未曾提過筆撕過稿，可是這麼一點意思，這樣一個概念，在我的腦海中來回的環繞着，已經很久了：然而終於沒有把他寫出來的原因，一則因爲想不出一個適當恰合的標題，二則因本文寫出來，恐怕太長了一點，不大適合報紙體裁，因而就擱置至今，終於未去動筆頭，最近申報醫藥週刊，已出版好幾期了；不但篇幅宏大，內容文字，都非常的精采名貴，新醫界增加了這樣一個有力的醫藥刊物，宣傳科學新醫，使新醫社會化，民衆化，這不能不說是「申報一的厚意，豈只我們醫界同人應表示歡迎，凡申報的閱者，全體的民衆，都應來表無限的同情與歡迎！</p>
<p>文章的標題是定爲「醫師的社會任務」。雖然還是覺得不大合意，可是沒有更好的題目，也可不去管他了。至於文字的長短，我想也不成爲問題的；最近的幾期申報醫藥週刊中，就有好多篇精采優美的醫論長文。在　固然知道寫不出精采和優美的文字，可是只要不以文字的長短，限制我腦子裏思維，就是夠了。</p>
<p>恕我說了一些與正文不關痛癢的閒話；現在來寫「言歸正傳」的本文吧。</p>
<p>要說醫師的社會任務，我們就先要發問，醫師與人類社會的關係了。人類的生活，難免無疾病臨身的苦痛；解除這疾病的苦痛。就是醫藥。執行解除這人類病痛的執務的人，就是醫師。所以醫師即是解除人類病痛的執行者。沒有醫藥，人類的意外病痛，就不容易解除，而且往往因而喪失生命；可是有了醫藥，　無應用醫藥的人，也還是徒然。所以醫師與人類社會的關係，是有這樣的深切，人類社會是一天也少不了醫師的存在。因此就很明白的知道了。醫師的最大而唯一的任務，就是應用醫藥以救治並預防人類所發生的疾病痛苦，以維康樂生活的目的。這種不幸的疾苦，意外的病痛，又處處與社會的生活環境，以及個人的智識程度，有密切的關係。坐汽車住洋房的有產者，他們對疼病的感染，當然比起住在貧民窟裏的無產貧民要減少得多。具備醫藥常識而使日常的生活，合乎衛生化的人們，和一般不明衛生爲何物的民衆和，相比起來，不消說感染疾病的機會，也自然的減少得多了。在我們中國這麼糟的　會環境，這樣惡劣的生活形態之下的民衆，他們疾病的增加，是必然的現象，可是救治病痛疾苦的醫療的缺乏，又是不能否認的事實，中國社會這般的糟糕，這麼的破碎，我們却是中華民國的國民，我們是在中國社會底下執行醫務的中國醫師：凡屬做醫師的我們，都應具深切的同情，明瞭做醫師的任務，來加緊努力於救治疾苦病痛的中國民衆的工作。我們千萬不要把賺錢營業甚而至於發財的念頭，作爲醫師的唯一目的；更不可以民衆的無知，作爲欺蒙詐財的良好機緣。把醫藥當作營業致富甚至欺蒙詐財的工具，便失了醫師的眞下任務，宣布醫師人格道德的破產。只有應用醫藥來救治民衆的病痛疾苦，才是醫師的最大而唯一的任務！</p>

<h3>所謂推克諾克拉西Ｔｅｃｈｎｏｃｉａｃｙ</h3>
<p>— 蔭</p>
<p>││一個經濟的政治的最新怪物││</p>
<p>歐洲大戰的結果，把整個的世界，攪得落花流水。舉凡社會的經濟的政治的組織，起了絕大的變動，而尤其經濟的騷擾，使一切都陷於萬刦不復的深淵中；甚至以「萬世榮華」自居的美利堅聯邦，自一九二九年股票暴落風潮發生後，也是滿目瘡痍，慘不忍睹：許多大銀行倒閉了，許多大公司破產了，失業的人數由三百萬而五百萬一千萬一千三百萬！物價如此的低落，自殺的人是這樣的衆多，這種種現象，沒有一件不是暴露資本主義社會「日薄崎嵫」的眞面目。雖則還許多僞善的近視的政治家實業家以及那班落伍的經濟學者，用盡心力，要想把資本主義的形骸，從垂死的境地中拯救過來，但「病入膏盲，」已沒有醫治的希望了，這險惡的病象，非但不能减輕，反而一大深似一天！因此產生許多不同的主義，希望來一下澈底的變動，以代替現存的一切不良制度。</p>
<p>推克諾克拉西（Tｅｃｈｎｏｃｒａｃｙ）便是還許多主義中最新的一個。他究竟是什麼東西？產生在什麼地方？對於我們有什麼關係？關於這些，我們都應該加以一番研究，爰在這裏首先作一個簡單的介紹。</p>
<p>這個嶄新的主義不要說在中國沒有露過面，就是在外國轟動還不過四個月，字典上還趕不上編排進去，所以一定的定義是很難下的。照字面來說，“Tｅｃｈｎｏ＂卽是技術（Tｅｃｈｎｏｌｏｇｙ）“Cｒａｃｙ”卽是政治，併起來，便名「技術政治」。這個「技術政治」的怪物，是在去年十一月由美國的一個工程師集團所倡說的，而其中一個哈瓦特史各脫（Hｋｗａｒｄ　ｓｃｏｔｔ）就是這怪物的發明者。所謂「技術政治」簡單的說來便是：「具體的闡明機械與人的關係，而用這關係來管理政治，統制經濟」。其主要的原則爲：㈠儘量利用機械，减少人類勞動的時間，務使每個人有勞動的機會，不使失業的恐慌再見於人間，而以餘下的勞力，轉向到促進人類的文化方面去；㈡廢止貨幣制度，另以「能力」（Eｎｅｒｇ）來代替這單位，務使做到各盡所能，各取所需的地步；㈢因爲一切政治的社會的制度，都是隨經濟而轉移，所以應該由負責改善經濟的技術家來管理政治。這樣便具體的產生了所謂「技術政治」的怪物。</p>
<p>有人以爲這樣的論調，有什麼新奇？其實與其他各種的主義，確乎頗有出入之處。其最易分別的一點，就是歷來的主義，都是從政治學經濟學等社會科學的立場做出發點，所加以研究的結果。而「技術政治」，却是從技術家以及實騐科學者的立場，做出發點，所加以研究的結果：前者是理論的，而後者却是實騐的，這是顯然的不同。「科學管理法」，「產業合理化」，甚至日人所謂「經濟統制」，雖則也是研究機械與人的關係，提倡儘量利用機械去生產，或者集中經濟組織，設法改善經濟的制度，但是這種種方法，都是以「經濟」爲始，也以「經濟」爲終的、而「技術政治」，却兼及「政治」的作用，說牠依美國社會背景而產生的一種新社會主義也未始不可，因爲美國的資本帝國主義的崩潰，在吃「機械生產」的虧，實際這樣的生產方法，並沒有錯誤，祇是在政治上根本有了缺陷的緣故，因而流弊叢生。這「技術政治」，原來想利用固有的「機械生產」特點，以和平的方法，主張以技術家來改善政治的經濟的制度。所以卽使呌牠是新的社會主義，與蘇俄的社會主義也有些不同。甚至與我國胡適之等所提倡的「專家政治」也兩樣。「專家政治」也者「就是說各該行政官吏者應該讓對於各該行政學識有專門研究的人來充任。譬如外交部長，應該讓對於外交有專門研究的人充任。各巿的巿長，應該讓對於巿政有專門研究的人充任。而「技術政治」，却認爲經濟有了辦法，一切都有辦法，經濟的改善，卽主張儘量利用機械由技術家的力量來負責辦理，所以「政治」也應該一樣的主張站在機械的立場由技術家來管理。</p>
<p>這怪物的作用，大槪是如此。可是能不能實現？有沒有流弊？對於人類究有若何影響？以這樣單純的原則來統馭如此複雜的人　，是不是行得通的事情？這種種都有待於讀者深切的研究，這裏，作者祇介紹這個怪物給諸位見面而已。　　　│一九三三，二，十二，晨│</p>
<h3>儲蓄銀行與調劑平民金融</h3>
<p>— 馮振玉</p>
<p>年來社會經濟，益形衰弱，固由天災人禍之所侵逼，而比較佔多數中產以下之平民感於經濟困難，致生產能力减少，未始無因。故如何謂劑平民金融，乃當前亟待解决之問題也。</p>
<p>嘗考吾國銀行，非不發達。但其運用資金，恒避却需要緊迫之方面，而趨向需要不緊迫之方面，風氣相沿，幾成通弊。凡屬有產階級，資力殷實者，雖無所需要，銀行亦爭相投資；反是者雖有緊急用途亦不易得其援助。此類銀行，其爲有產階級之金融機關，而與平民關係隔絕，無可諱言。雖然，吾人亦不可盡加資雖；蓋平民放欵，利息微薄，手續繁重，爲公認之事實。且銀行本有相異之性質，并顧兼籌，力或不逮，吾於此不得不希望於今之儲蓄銀行。</p>
<p>儲蓄銀行者，以吸收零星存欵爲目的，其原則上本爲一般平民之金融機關，但目前事實所昭示於吾人者，祇得謂之爲片面平民金融機關而已。蓋平民僅得零星儲蓄之便，而有不獲通融資金之苦，於此環境，適予鑽營謀利者以重利盤剝之機會，求之者明知不勝負擔，但旣告貸無門，亦惟飲酖止渴，事之痛心，寗甚於此。補救之道。惟改善儲蓄銀行營業政策，注意調劑不民金融是已。時賢有主張仿辦馬立斯制銀行者，其爲調劑平民金融，同出一轍，但吾國類此組織尙未前見，將來能否辦理得宜，亦不敢必。爲今之計不如仍由各儲蓄銀行參酌馬氏制度，舉行平民借欵，比較事半而功倍。良經儲蓄銀行與平民往來，較爲接近，其經濟狀況，信用能力，自亦易爲調查也。至貸欵制度，應以信用能力爲基礎，按期儲蓄爲條件，是卽馬立斯制之特質，亦爲吾國所應借鏡者。舉辦之後，試爲統計，以今日社會情形，敢信借欵用途屬於維持生活者，至少佔十分之五，投資經營事業者，亦必佔十分之三以上，其與地方治安，社會經濟之關係，蓋可想見。願當局諸公，亟起圖之，固平民之幸，亦社會之福也。</p>
<p>前者寗波交通銀行與上海商業儲蓄銀行均已定有平民借欵辦法，雖以事屬初創，尙未聞有顯著之成績。但平民金融前途已現曙光。該兩行不避艱難爲衆服務之精神，亦堪欽佩，如果續加努力，將來定有以副吾人之希望，可預卜也。（却）</p>
<h3>日滙低落與我國貿易之影響</h3>
<p>— 茅震初</p>
<p>一國對外匯價之升降，無不直接影響及於對外貿易之消長，若對外匯兌價格昂升，則貨幣購貿力爲之提高，此其時也，外貨之輪人亦必隨之倶增，往往造成輸入超於輸出之現象；反之，如對外匯兌價格低落，則貨幣購貿力必爲之下降，此其時也，一方外貨輸入减少，一方又可利用外國對已購貿力增高之機會，儘量輸出，往往進入出超佳境。日本自政府决定再度實行金輸出禁止以後，對外匯兌頓生動搖，匯兌價格之低落，僅及解禁時半價以下，以目前言之，雖稍稍上漲，然上下甚微，無關大勢。此種匯兌下落之結果，雖對於其國內物價不無相當　貴，（據最近日本物價統計約增二倍左右）而因其能善自利用此低落機會，大量輸出，奪取國外巿場故，在國際收支方面，有益無損，同時收入激增，國內物價所　貴之兩倍左右，亦得有所補償，卽使未能達到出超境地，要　未足以影響其國民生計也。</p>
<p>惟是此大宗輸出貨品，向外傾銷，自當遍及國際巿場，不至僅以中國爲其惟一之尾　，况中國方屬行低制，又爲用銀國家，自金貴銀賤風潮發生以遠，購買能力减退，傾銷之途，打開匪易，孰知有大　不然者在　蓋國際各國，均採用關稅保護政策，競謀阻擋外貨進路，關稅壁壘，重重疊疊，不容輕易破陣而入？甚至如向予日貨自由進出之美國及南洋羣島諸殖民地政府，最近亦以日貨之源源輸入，急謀抵制之道。日貨卽到處被阻，其惟一出路捨中國外，庸有他過？緣中國之處境，實予日貨進攻以莫大便利：㈠中國關稅不能自由主，非但無自由增稅限制日貨傾銷之能力，抑且有片面的中日關稅互惠協定之產製；㈡中國以對外購買力雖與日本同處低落地位，惟以本國產業不發達故，一切日用必需之品，十九仰給於外洋，卽便意識的立志不買日貨，亦必雖抑其物質的享用，又無力改購高倘的美貨英貨等其他各國貨品，而日貨現在匯價低落之候，自絕易取英美等貨在中國之地位而代之，不難獲得暢銷機會也。此則證之我國以及日本去年貿易狀况而益信：我國去年貿易狀况，可謂悲慘已極，一方出口達最低程度，爲　戰以後所絕　僅有，一方入超登峯造極，開六十餘年來未有之新紀錄，同時日本去年自四月以後，因得匯兌下落之賜，對外貿易　　順利，全年總計出口額一，三七○，○○○，○○○進口額爲一，二九三，○○○，○○○已步入出超之佳境矣。</p>
<p>我國最近以外交上對俄復交之關係，所需一部份之外貨，已改向俄國購取，計自宣佈復交迄今，爲時不及兩月，而輸入俄貨，已達一百四十餘萬兩之钜。不買日貨，換購俄貨，在國富方面，同一　　，何况日貨輸入，並不因俄貨之輸入而减少？若任令此兩大外貨爭霸我國巿場，結果總是精盡血竭，經濟破產，是以本年內因日匯低落之故，預斷日貨之輸入當更甚於　，中國巿場實雖有拒日貨於千里之外之能力，對於國貨前途，尤多一層暗影。吾人决不能離開經濟的原理而從以爲依靠意識的抵制，空口動人販賣日貨，不購用日貨，便可奏效，吾人應站於經濟的立場考慮如何方可以振興國產之實力的方法　澈底的抵制也。</p>
<h3>中俄通商幾個時期</h3>
<p>— 仲</p>
<p>啟蒙時期　中俄兩國，因爲國境的昆連，所以無諭就政治上，經濟上，都有密切的關係，尤其商業的關係，發軔最早。當西歷紀元前一三七年（漢建元二年，）漢武帝命張騫出使西域。騫通西域之後，於是諸國，始通於漢。到了後漢和帝時，又遣班超遠征西域諸國，以後西域五十多個國家，都納貢歸附中國，而中國與西域的貿易關係，亦漸漸密切起來。當時西域的範圍很廣，實際上包括現在中國的新疆，及今俄屬的吉利吉思（Kirgiz)，俄屬土耳斯坦，及阿富汗等地方。可知中俄貿易，起於漢代，直到現在，已經有二千多年了。</p>
<p>發展時期　魏晋以降，直到隋代，可以說是古代中俄貿易的發展時期。因爲到了魏晋時候，西域的範圍擴大，從漢代五十多國併成十六國，其葱嶺以西地域，伸展至俄屬裏海，及黑海地方。到了隋焬帝時，中國對西域諸國的貿易，極爲繁盛，當時並指定張掖，武威二郡，作爲東西兩個互巿，西域的商人，來往經商的，非常之多。　　閉關時期　自從明代中葉以降，直到淸代鴉片戰役（卽西歴一五一六年│一八四二年），可以說是中國對外貿易的閉關主義時期　因不當時葡，西，英，法，美，各國人民，紛紛到中國來，要求通商，而我國都抱拒絕的態度，俄國亦乘機要求陸路通商。中國方面，於康熙二十八年，與俄訂立尼布楚條約，許其通商。到了康熙三十二年，淸聖祖又規定「俄國商隊，三年得至北京一次，每隊以二百人爲限，得在俄羅斯館，留住八十日，貿易免稅。」到了雍正五年（西歴一七二七年）與俄訂立恰克圖條約，其內容亦無非俄國要求邊境通商吧了。</p>
<p>大戰以前　根據中國海關統計，對俄貿易的數字，以一八六七年（淸同治六年）爲始，當時對俄西伯利亞陸路貿易，已很發達，値百餘萬關兩。以後二十年中，對俄輸出數額，按年增進，在一八九○年，對俄輸出，達一千萬關兩，但是對俄輸入，絲毫沒有進步，每年祇維持三四十萬關兩的紀錄。中俄貿易，大戰以前很盛，在一九一六年其時對俄太平洋各港貿易非常發達，所以輸出總値，達六千五百萬關兩，同時輸入，亦增至二千萬關兩之钜。</p>
<p>大戰以後　大戰期間，在一九一七年，俄國革命燭發，以後二三年中，它對東方各國貿易封鎖，中國對俄進出口貿易，祇値一二千萬關兩。自從一九二○年，因歐洲大戰，及俄國革命，都告一段落，中俄的貿易亦愎蘇了。尤其在一九二八年，運往俄國的黃豆，豆餅，等貨品甚多，輸出總額達八千八百萬關兩之钜，輸入亦達二千萬關兩。是爲中俄貿易之全盛時期。講到最近二三年中，蘇俄的煤油，木材，大批傾銷到中國巿場上來。尤因它的國外貿易是國營的，有計劃的，中國巿場，祇有儘量容納之一法。至於中國的貨品，能否早暢銷俄國呢？那麼東北　，大荳產量减少，至於紅綠磚茶，近年銷俄不多，所以未來的中俄貿易，也許是一個入超時期，亦難以抱樂觀呢！</p>

<p>（三）接觸殺虫劑　倉房內部之罅隙</p>
<p>、有虫間藏其間、薰蒸之力、不易達到人工　　亦不易肅淸、如此則利用片油、或偏蘇爾、以筆滴、或器噴注入罅隙、不久則虫死矣、過後打開門窗以通空氣、</p>
<p>（四）日光爭離法　直射之陽光、下鋪二寸厚之草木灰一層、堆糧食於其上、使陽光照射、虫感此光熱、卽往向下移動、約僅一小時、則移去表面一層、約一寸許之糧、而令其下層、再感光受熱、而虫漸次下降、最後則虫藏於灰下矣、</p>
<p>以上所言皆爲除蟲方面、實際則食房之建築、與食糧貯藏之久暫、及虫害鼠患、與食糧之物理化學變化俱有關係、</p>
<h3>昌化鷄血石</h3>
<p>— 何冰</p>
<p>由杭州乘長途汽車一直前行，沿着彎彎曲曲的山道，經過餘杭，臨安，及於　三縣，　到了昌化。昌化和安徽接壤，繁山環繞、除爲皖浙交通的要道外，是一個不關重要的小縣。並沒有什麼著名的物產，也沒有興盛的商業。所以，那裏有一句俗話，上句是「富不上萬」但同時人口不多，地力並不怎樣瘠薄，卽使沒有專做，也可到山上去打一担野柴來賣，因之下句是「貧不計飯」。</p>
<p>但是，昌化却有一種物產，使它的名聲不但四達國內，而且還佈外洋。那便是昌化的鷄血石。</p>
<p>鷄血石，是一種礦石的名稱，用作雕刻，尤其是刻圖章，別處不產，僅昌化有之。昌化全縣也不是各處皆產，僅離縣城二百里外之十二都地方產之，十二都有個玉石洞，祇有這個洞裏是產鷄血石。洞絕黑暗。鷄血石任人開採，但開採一次，至少須用五十元代價的炸藥。炸下來的大塊粗石，其中未必含有鷄血石，有十分之七八是完全失望的。萬幸含有多少鷄血石，則尙須　煉的工作，在在須時須費，卽使製造成功，因其並非爲必　品，很難立卽售出，所以，一般經濟不裕的小農，對於這種取之不禁的天賜，也祇有望洋興嘆。當地開採鷄血石的，莫非是些地主富農及商人。他們用五六十元的資本，開採一次，幸而中的，售出不雖得一二千元。</p>
<p>鷄血石，是個總名，隨其式樣的不同，還有鷄血凍，　色等名稱。最上乘的，是石上帶紅色如鷄血，實際上好壞全由購者鑒別，和古玩一樣，並無一定標準。價格自數分數角起，以至數千元　不等。購者當然是些國內好書　，雕刻，古玩，的所謂文人雅士，運輸外中的也廣，尤以日本人收實的爲多。昌化母年採出，總數亦有近十萬元之巨。在以前，鷄血石還可作貢物，給滿洲的王公大臣們使用，現在這筹生意是斷絕了。</p>

<h3>流浪漢（三）</h3>
<p>— 伽</p>
<p>媽的！咱就恨這老天，儘愛磨折咱們窮人！刮了半天大風，刮得人皮兒全生痛不算，又飄飘蕩蕩的落起雪花兒來啦。咱一勁兒朝前跑，雪花兒也一勁兒的朝咱追，咱跑得沒多遠路，身上的貼血义兒就全給堆上了棉花絮。可是這棉花絮兒跟旁的不同，不但沒得一釘點兒暖氣，還呌咱抖抖慄慄的直打哆嗦。咱巴不得早一些跑到窩裏去買夜茶，這天氣，可眞呌咱不受用！</p>
<p>迎面跑來一個人，氣呼呼的朝咱身上撞，差點沒把咱撞了個元寶翻身。咱剛想衝他罵，沒想到他竟跟咱打起招呼來啦。</p>
<p>「嘻！三牛子，這麼大雪天，你跑出來幹嗎」？</p>
<p>咱一瞧，原來那個人是王小六子，跟咱一塊兒在老虎灶裏買夜茶的。咱擱不住撮着半截笑勁兒回答他說：「難不成咱就不許出來發利巿嗎？」</p>
<p>王小六子的身上也跟咱一樣，堆滿了雪棉絮，就只腦杓兒上揷着的頂工，却是嶄新的兔毛片兒，瞧光景至少値得一二寸水頭，也不知他怎麼股勁兒從哪兒弄來的。咱瞧着瞧着，可就瞧得　啦。</p>
<p>王小六子早就瞧料破了咱的心事，一起手，便把頂工扯下來跟咱說：「這是拋頂工拋來的，你瞧，摸樣兒可興嗎？」</p>
<p>咱沒得話說，一隻手，不知不覺的就往上伸，摸着了腦杓兒，摸着了一手雪。嘿！了不得！咱也得去弄　頂工來揮揮，這麼大雪天，雪落在髮根兒上，再給風吹成冰，可不是活受罪哇！咱撤開了王小六子就跑。</p>
<p>雪還在落着，咱可縮到一條暗弄裏來啦。弄外邊，就是電車站，電車輪子叮叮叮的，叮到這兒，就停　了下來。咱推了許久，想捉個空兒下手，可不知怎麼着，那夥琉璃窗兒全關得緊騰腾的，沒得咱發利巿。好容易捱到一部開着窗兒的，一個赤老伸着腦杓兒朝外瞧，腦杓兒上，一雙頂工。咱一瞧見，心窩裏邊的小鹿兒就歡蹦亂跳起來，也顧不到這隻頂工的好歹，一個箭步　出弄去，跑到車跟前，一起手，就把頂工從那赤老的腦杓兒上給扯了下來。　　那赤老僅是在車廂裏讓，電車可叮叮叮的開遠啦。咱差一點沒把下巴　兒全笑落了下來。試着把那隻頂工往腦門上一插，剛剛合式。咱仍舊縮到那條暗弄裏去，弄裏邊，不知什麼時候來了個曲死，拉開了义兒在撒鳥，脚跟前，放着一隻蒲包，一條火腿，瞧模樣準是送年禮的。嚇！你送年禮，不如送給咱來得見情。咱老實不客氣，順手牽羊的，上前一把提了就走。那曲死，嘴裏邊「哎│而！哎！而」的，不知嚷的什麼。多謝他的尿頭子，把他給絆住，咱可生受他的啦。</p>
<p>咱今兒可眞走運哩！到處都碰得見財香，到處都有利巿發。咱一隻手提着蒲包火腿，一隻手摸着貼血袋裏的五隻小立司馬，嘴裏邊，不知不覺的就哼起「哭七七」來。</p>
<p>「頭七到哭哀哀，手拿紅被蓋上來。…」（完）</p>
<h3>戰略關係</h3>
<p>— 何家幹</p>
<p>首都救國日報上有句名言：</p>
<p>「浸使爲戰略關係，須暫時放棄北平，以便引敵深入…應嚴厲責成張學良，以武力制止反對運動，雖流血亦所不辭」。（見上海日報二月九日轉載）。</p>
<p>雖流亦所不辭！勇敢哉戰略大家也！</p>
<p>血的確流過不少，正在流的更不少，將要流的還不知道有多多少少。這都是反對運動者的血。爲着什麼？爲着戰略關係。</p>
<p>戰略家在去處上海打仗的時候，曾經說：『爲戰略關係，退守第二道防線』，這樣就退兵：過了兩天又說，爲戰略關係，『如日軍不向我軍射擊，則我軍不得開槍，着士兵一體遵照』，這樣就停戰。此後，『第二道線』消失，上海和議開始，談判，簽字，完結。那時候，大槪爲着戰略關係也曾經見過血？這是軍機大事，小民不得而知｜｜至於　自流過血的雖然知道，他們又已經沒有了舌頭。究竟那時候的敵人爲什麼沒有『被誘深入』？</p>
<p>現在我們知道了：那次敵人所以沒有『被誘深入者』，决不是當時戰略家的手段太不高明，也不是完全由於反對運動者的血流得『太少』；而另外還有個原因：原來英國從中調停｜｜暗地裏和日本有了諒解，說是日本呀，你們的軍隊暫時退出上海，我們英國更進一步來帮你的忙，使滿洲國不致於被國聯否認，｜｜這就是現在國聯的什麼什麼草案，什麼什麼委員的態度。這其實是說，你不要在這裏深入，｜｜這裏是有贓大家分，｜｜你先到北方去深入再說。深入還是要深入，不過地點暫時不同。</p>
<p>因此，『誘敵深入北平』的戰略目前就需要了。流血自然又要多流幾次。</p>
<p>其實，現在一切準備停當，行都陪都色色俱全，文化古物，和大學生，也已經各自喬遷。無論是黃面孔，白面孔，新大陸，舊大陸的敵人，無論這些敵人要深入到什麼地方，都請深入羅。至於怕有什麼反對運動，那我們的戰略家…『雖流血亦所不辭！』放心，放心。</p>
<h3>希望眞命天子降臨的人們</h3>
<p>— 豈凡</p>
<p>倘使我說你在希望着眞命天子的出現，你一定不承認，要當我侮蔑你。你自以爲這種封建思想，已經掃除淨盡了，你還敢擔保現在沒有人會希望有皇帝出現的。</p>
<p>但是事實是這樣的嗎？在中國的許多地方，確有許多人仍還眷念着眞命天子。兩個月之前，山東的公安局不是捉着了皇帝皇后嗎？而且眞有不少的人望着眞命天子出來了天下可以太平，把現世的所以如此擾亂，都歸罪於少了一個眞命天子。在他們的心目中，眞命天子是救人民於水火之中的恩神，一切困難苦厄，都可以解除，只要眞命天子一來，全民衆立卽可以幸福了，所以在這禍亂頻仍有年頭，這樣要有個眞命天子的思想，益加雖以消除了。</p>
<p>那麼希望天下太平社會安寗民衆和樂等等念頭，你也有的吧。希望生活安定事業發達等等念頭你也有的吧。還有希望沒有貪官汚吏沒有苛捐雜稅你也表同情的吧。法益法權的不受侵害生命財產的正當保衛你也希望有的吧。那是一定的，你也希望這片國土這個民族這個社會的進展向上繁榮發達的。</p>
<p>不過，請問，你爲了這個目的，曾經怎樣奮鬬過嗎？你曾經有什麼努力可以述說嗎？</p>
<p>抱歉得很，那不曾有。那麼你實在比希望眞命天子降臨的人們還不如。沒有努力沒有奮鬬，你想得到一切的安福，那不是和他們想靠了眞命天子的出現而得着一切安福一樣嗎？他們還不曾知道怎樣可以求得幸福，並且只當有了眞命天子才能得福，而你却是知道眞命天子是不可靠的。</p>
<p>不曾知道除了眞命天子以外須由別路以達到幸福的人們，還有幾分可恕；知道眞命天子的靠不住，但也不肯自已去努力求出路尊正道，坐着等幸福從天上掉下來，這豈不太蠢太懶。幸福不會平空從天上掉下來是很明白的，不會從抓着的人的掌中溜出來也是顯然的，那麼茫然地坐着等什麼？結果，你還不是和他們一樣在等着眞命天子民族英雄天才大師出來，爲他們努力奮鬬，殺開一條血路，把人民從水深火熱中救出來，給他們以幸福。</p>
<p>不肯自己動，希望別人做，自然是頂敏的人。等着眞命天子民族英雄天才大師來替代我們吃苦努力，固然是很好的辦法，但是倘使他們不來呢？况且他們來了之後，果眞能給我們以滿足嗎？這是誰也不敢保障的。一切的眞命天子民族英雄天才大師都一樣，等他們有了地位之後，人民你還要求着第二批的眞命天子民族英雄天才大師的。</p>
<p>希望眞命天子降臨的人。應該拋棄這個希望了。知道不能有眞命天子出現的人，也應該不要再等英雄和天才的崛起，而要想出可以自己努力的辦法。要眞命天子，想英雄想天才來救度我們，爲我們努力開闊大路，是偷懶的念頭。要把這懶惰從我們的生活中除去，才有出路。你是不想眞命天子會降臨的，這是不會錯的，你也要有自己的努力，並且要啟發別的人不要再云希望眞命天子或英雄和天才。</p>

<h3>時代與愛的歧路（續稿二十六）</h3>
<p>— 張資平</p>
<p>「此刻到底往那裏去好呢？」</p>
<p>他看見電車來了，才想到自己的目的地還沒有决定。到學校去當然是不可能的了，因爲一本書，一冊抄本都沒有帶來。到任碩士家中去，時候太早了，並且也不是妥當的地方，因爲他此刻的精神還有幾分興奮着，不能鎭靜，氣喘喘的走到任家去，多難爲情呢。</p>
<p>他正在思想，電車又開走了。</p>
<p>「對了，有路走了，到老曹家裏去吧。…………」</p>
<p>他决意搭了電車，再朝東多走三分之一里的路，到Z路口去搭公共汽車。他走到Z路口，看見一輛公共汽車剛剛開去走了，只好站在電柱下，候第二輛的公共汽車。</p>
<p>「啊呀！朱先生！」</p>
<p>他忽然看見學校的文科敎授朱渭道先生靠着電柱打瞌睡，便呌了一聲。朱先生本不是他級裏的頂台敎員，只是担了兩鐘頭的英文，在他們，是隨意選修的功課。</p>
<p>「啊，密司脫林！」</p>
<p>朱先生穿着雙行大扣的黑呢大衣，肩脇下挾着一個黑漆皮包，聽見有人呌他同，忙睜開他的一雙倦眼來，望了望海泉。</p>
<p>「朱先生，上課去麼？」</p>
<p>「唉，眞討厭！…………」</p>
<p>朱先生說了半句話，就咳嗽了一陣。他不忙說話，伸手進大衣袋裏去取了一包橡膠糖出來</p>
<p>抽出一片送進嘴裏去了。</p>
<p>「你要不要？」朱先生含着橡膠糖，把那個糖包送到海泉嘴邊來。</p>
<p>「什麼糖？」</p>
<p>海泉從朱先生手裏也抽了一片出來，但不忙送進口裏去。</p>
<p>「Cｈｅｗｉｎｇ　Gｕｍｇ」</p>
<p>「Cｈｅｗｉｎｇ　Gｕｍ」</p>
<p>因爲他沒有吃過這種橡膠精，他臉上表示了一下懷疑的神氣。</p>
<p>「橡皮糖，香口的，」</p>
<p>海泉嘗了一下，覺得有趣。</p>
<p>「在那裏有得賣，朱先生？」</p>
<p>「………………」</p>
<p>朱先生撈着嘴，向對過伸了一伸他的下顎。海泉看見對過有一家日俄開的糖菓店。他想，曹世光是有小孩子的，就買幾包橡皮糖帶去給他們作禮物吧。公共汽車還沒有來，他走過去買了六包，又回來電桿下，和朱先生談天。</p>
<p>「朱先生，這早就有課？」</p>
<h3>奇文共賞</h3>
<p>— 周敬儕</p>
<p>大人先生們把「故宮古物」看得和命（當然不是小百姓的命）一般堅决南遷，無非因爲「古物」價值不止「連城」，並且容易搬動，容易變錢的原故，這也値得你們大驚小怪，冷嘲熱諷！我正這樣想着的時候，居然從首都一家報紙上見到贊成「古物南遷」的社論；並且建議「武力制上反對」，「流血在所不辭」，請求政府「保持威信」，「貫澈政策」！這樣的宏詞高論，我實在不忍使牠湮沒無聞，因特不辭辛苦，抄錄出來獻給大衆。</p>
<p>「……北平各團體之反對古物南遷，爲有害北平將來之繁榮，此種自私自利完全蔑視國家利益之理由，北平各團體竟敢說說出，吾人以服其厚顏恥，彼等只爲北平之繁榮，必須以見未免太小，使政府爲戰略關係，須暫時放棄北平，以便引敵深入，聚而殲之，則古物必被敵人刦奪而去，試問將來北平之繁榮何由維持，故不如先行遷移，俟打倒日本，北平安如泰山後，再行遷回，北平各團體自私自利，固可惡可恥，其無遠慮，亦可憐也，其反對遷移之又一理由，則謂政府應先顧全土地，其言似是而實非，蓋放棄一部份土地供敵人一進之佔領，以殲滅敵人，然後再行恢復，古今中外，其例甚多，如一八一二年之役，俄人不但放棄莫斯科，且將莫斯科燒毀，以困拿破崙，歐戰時，比利時，塞爾維亞，皆放棄全部領土，供敵人蹂躪，座將强德擊破，蓋領土被佔，只須不與敵人媾和，簽字於割讓條約，則敵人固無如該土何，至於故宮古物，若不遷移，設不幸北平被敵人佔領，將古物刦奪而去，試問中國將何法以恢復之，行見中國文明結晶，供敵人戰利品，可恥孰甚，……最後吾人奉告政府，政府遷移古物之政策，旣已决定，則不論遇如何阻礙，應求其貫澈，若一經無見識無遠慮之羣愚反對，卽行中止，政府威信何在，故吾主張嚴責張學良，使以武力制止反對運動，若不得已，雖流血亦所不辭……」</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>觀火及其他</h3>
<p>— 吾</p>
<p>中國人常有一種欣災樂禍的心理，這可以得到許多證明，即如去年大馬路某某銀樓失火，在當事者當然有說不出的悲哀，但是在觀火的人們，却有一種無可形容的快樂，理由很簡單，因爲燒的是別人的房屋。，損失的是別人的財產。，所以。，這大可以不關痛瘙。，樂得。「隔路觀火。」，於是大家呼孥喚子。：</p>
<p>「大家來呀，多麼好看哦，火燒大馬路！」</p>
<p>不管這火災是否會燒遍大馬路，不管它是否會蔓延到自己家裏來，但是在火勢正猛烈好看的時候，總還得樂一樂，因爲這是不可多得的大好機會，値得樂，値得笑。</p>
<p>其次就拿看殺人而說，阿大聽着了某地要處决犯人，以上想到，「殺人？呀！這該是一種怎樣好看的情景喲！嚓│對準５子一刀，於是血，血，鮮紅的血迸出來，好看好看！」馬上完全盡義務的各處報信。。</p>
<p>「去呀，去呀，看殺人去，多麼好看哦，嚓……」</p>
<p>於是阿二曉得了，要去看，阿三阿四也曉得了，也要去看，大家都去看爲的是看殺別人，殺自己不相干的人，不管日後自己的頸𩓐上會不會也要照樣嚓的一刀。</p>
<p>再其次如過去不久的山東的「秋操，」四川「新取城都」的全武行，在我們看來，也是滿有趣的，雖然遠方的人不一定可以親眼看見，如看「火燒大馬路」那般淸楚明瞭，但是就在報紙上讀讀某軍三次衝鋒，死傷無算，某軍又大舉包抄，繳械數千，也不是毫無趣味的，當然，他們打仗。，他們死人。，干我甚事。？天然用不着反對。。萬一這邊也打起來了。，到那時再逃。，並不爲遲。，何况已經有人在高唱廢止。，不是一會兒就要天下太平的嗎。？</p>
<p>又其次。，日帝國主義打到瀋陽了，不要緊。，好在是關外。，對於我們南方人。，毫無關係。。日本兵血洗閘北了，不要緊。，好在是華界。，對於我們信在租界上的人。，毫無關係。。現在又佔領榆關，打到平津來了，不要。緊，好在是北方。，對於我們住在上海的人。，毫無關係。。於是大家都心境平和。，反正死的是他們。，燒的是他們的房子。，姦的是他們的妻女。，干我甚麼？何况帶發明了最有意義的。「長期抵抗。」四字。，更足以怡然自得。。於是茶舞幾回。。，遊藝幾次。，萬救國於娛樂之中。，一舉兩得，既救國又開心。，何樂而不爲。？萬一覺得有點過意不去。，不妨多打幾個電報給國聯。，以正視聽。，而彰公理。。少不了忙煞外國的尖頭們。（Genetleman），一次「理事。」，兩番。「小組。」，於是我們更加有了信心。，既經有人出力。，何必自己勞神？即使有人一定要自己動手。，我們也不妨盡力的使其鎭靜。或是老實不客氣的賞他兩記耳光。，待那時再說。，萬一强盜們結做一團，也必須先「安內」而後攘外，何况，難道中國眞的就會瓜分。</p>
<p>隔江觀火。，何等開心。，中國人常有一種欣災樂禍的心理。</p>

<h3>恐怖的回憶</h3>
<p>— 阿奎</p>
<p>近來航空救國的呼聲鬧得烟霧騰騰，不由得使我憶起了去年的恐怖！</p>
<p>「自己睏不起，大淸早的又來噪人了？」老王聽見了「蓬蓬」之聲；以爲又是體育指導用籃球來打門，所以高聲的喊着，但是外面沒有回答，聲音也停了·</p>
<p>「今天怎麼飛機聲特別響？」又是老王說·</p>
<p>我們校後面是航空學校，每天早上他們得早操·但是今天聲音却是特別響，而且是由遠而近，愈響愈密·</p>
<p>「蓬蓬」之聲又來了，老王以爲又是體育指導了？於是氣狠狠地走出開門，外面是沒有人，突然的老王喊着說·　　「快來看呀！今天他們大操飛機排列得很好看·」</p>
<p>我們霞，方，三人連忙從被窠裏跳出來到門口看，眼尖的霞早哎呀一聲說·</p>
<p>「這是日本飛機呀！翼上不是紅色的太陽嗎？」</p>
<p>膽小的我連忙提議走進臥室，別被敵人看見吃炸彈·大家縮進了臥室，門緊閉着，從玻璃窗裏望出去；飛機祇是圍着我校，但，忽然的又向後去了，原來他們發覺了目標錯誤，同時後面也有一二步槍聲發現·</p>
<p>敎務處曉得了，連忙命令學生逃走·於是各自拿着現洋，女學生慌得都哭了，先生只是喊着快走，好似立刻我們校裏就會被炸般的，</p>
<p>飛機愈飛愈低，連上面坐的人都看得很淸，這樣低，怎麼辦呢、不逃，也得炸死，於是不管一切，一窠蜂的向西山逃去·</p>
<p>航空校裏的哨兵在高喊「分開！」於是大家憶起了集合着一大羣的危險，却然，说也可笑，受了二年的軍訓，在慌亂中竟然連這一點軍事學識都忘掉了？　　航空校裏的飛機已來不及飛起，所以給炸彈毀了，後來航空校裏人說，幸虧敵人發覺目標錯誤。否則我們蠶校準得吃炸彈呢。</p>
<p>這雖是去年底事，但，現在熱河等處也正在受這樣的慘殺，轟炸，不過上海人終究是福氣？（至少在一般人看起來）飛機來向租界上跑，但，哼！觀於列强的態度，終有一天在租界裏也得嚐這滋味呢？有那一國是眞在帮忙呢，</p>
<h3>踏進城隍廟的影像</h3>
<p>— 羣</p>
<p>│求人不如求已</p>
<p>並不是鄕下人初次到上海，也不是小孩子要買走馬燈來鬧元宵，僅爲了到新北門看一個朋友，我取了這城隍廟的便道。</p>
<p>南京路上的虹廟，許多人認爲英租界的遺憾，理由是有碍布爾喬亞的瞻觀，但是我們的城隍廟漂亮得多了。牠有宏大的寶殿，水門汀的建築，祝融後的改觀，使人想起像西子湖畔的洋建築有同樣的概感。城隍廟的改裝門面，在本身上却有買一送一意想不到的營業鼎盛　　掛著黃布袋朝山進香的老太太，高跟鞋長旗袍的摩登小姐，瓜皮馬褂的好好先生，……在我進廟門的時候，各式不同的人類，擁擠在香燭攤旁，乖乖的孝敬幾文錢，乞丐們也可不費事的伸着手，銅元像天上掉下來般的從手裏溜進袋裏。</p>
<p>經過露天大菜間，　上大雄寶殿。香伙把接來的香燭元寶裝進他們的竹絲籃，於是老太太，摩登小姐，好好先生，不惜他們的尊膝，跪，叩首……老太太的癟嘴念念有詞，希望自己常命百歲，兒子升官發財，媳婦賢淑尊敬，百白胖胖的孫兒關煞開通，摩登小姐先紅着臉，微微一笑，兩個海上馳名的酒渦也使誠則靈的老爺恐怕被誘惑了似的低下頭去，小姐悠然微動櫻唇，暗祝我的他不討婊子女人，不租小房子，不軋姘頭的三不主義。好好先生更整襟危跪，店中年有盈餘，小開浪蕩不知店事，他可以上下其手，來年娶妻造屋之後，爲老爺開光。……</p>
<p>幾枚銅元的小事，就抱着偌大的希望。人生在世，本不外名利。但諺云，求名求利，求人不如求已。求人尙且不如求已，現在竟化了香燭元寶去求木刊泥塑的偶像，這種一本萬利的僥倖，完全暴露國人的弱點。</p>
<p>再大而言之，推廣到國家大事，你看九一八瀋陽事變之後，上海閘北的慘劇，再在恭禧聲中奪去了天下第一關。一方着着進逼，一方仰求於像木刊泥塑一樣的國聯木偶。牠的結果如何，無非和化了香燭元寶後歸去一樣要生病死人</p>
<p>布爾喬亞的人們以爲虹廟是英租界的遺憾，我們被壓迫的人們也應該警醒城隍廟是我們的弱點；用我們的拳頭給帝國主義一個警告。</p>
<p>我們的口號：「求人不如求已」。</p>
<h3>一個問題黃包車夫的兒子</h3>
<p>— 毓</p>
<p>我有幾個喜歡跑上茶樓去吃茶的朋友，問他們爲什麼不買了茶葉到家裏吃呢？他們的理由是：「茶樓一如社會的雛型，研究社會學的學者，大可以　而不費去跑跑茶樓：說什麼聽三海經，那是沒有得吃茶之個中三味了。」被他們這滑稽的答案，我也跑了幾天茶樓，居然耳聞了許多勝如目覩，値得討論的問題：黃包車夫的兒子，其一也。</p>
<p>有一位戴眼鏡的老者，每天滔滔不絕的和認識的茶客閒談，據朋友說，他從前做過律師的。那一天他講：他在陸家浜附近，有一所小房子，借給一個拉黃包車的江北人居住。他們共夫妻及兒子三人。男的天天拉車子，女的在門口擺了一個賣小孩子糖食和玩具的攤頭，生活到也安閒的過去。他們的兒子，生得聰明異常，做天下父母的，心都是一樣，不是希望兒子升官發財，榮宗耀祖；便是娶妻生子，成家立業。他們見兒子天資聰慧，想拉黃包車倒底不是好的職業，所以自小就將兒子送進學校讀書。他們的本意，讀書後可以改何種行業，當然根本沒有想到。不過以爲識了幾個字，多少將來可以比拉黃包車的苦事好點，就這樣，也想不到把兒子培植到初中畢業，老夫妻的意思，還想高中讀完，但是學費書費一切都太大，就作罷論。於是困難的問題，放展在他們面前的是找行業。在他們拉黃包車的看來，</p>
<p>讀到初中已是學富五車，（老律師說到這裏，不禁感慨係之），其實中學畢業生，坐在亭子間內等硬麺包的，不知有多少！老夫妻倆又沒有提携的親戚，無可奈何，想請自己的初中兒子屈居自家的貴攤頭。不料裝了一點洋氣的兒子，以爲這種事，有礙他中學生的面子。父親說他幾句，反偷了家裏的錢洋衣服，一走了之。……</p>
<p>故事記述到這里，可以不必再繼續。「天下何如吃飯難」，作者自己從畢業後，已深深的感到了。拉黃包車，當然沒有做官……以及拉包車好，但是人的慾望是沒有止境的，夫妻兩個見生活安閒，就把辛苦的錢培值兒子讀書，（　者不要誤會作者反對讀書）而所得的結果，却有意想不到之效力。我認爲這是一個很嚴重的問題，不知編者和讀者，以爲如何？</p>

<h3>法律的權威</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>敝友程君，前年因情面難却，加入四川路×呢絨雜貨商店爲股東。照該營業狀况看來，即在臨摹平時期也不過可以支持罷了·不料去年滬戰突起，影響所及，竟有四個多月，不能正式營業；而每天五十餘元的開支，却分文不能節省。坐是年終結帳，竟虧蝕至五千餘金。經理顧君，乃於今春召集股東會議，議决每股再各墊一千金，繼續維持；如有不允墊欵者，則將其股權作廢，際此社會經濟，水盡山窮的時候，程君在事業上，再沒有墊欵的能力了；但不墊欵，則以前所繳的半股股本，計洋一千元，又要受「作廢」的處分。終日長吁短嘆，終想不出一個妙法，來應付牠。昨天承他不棄，來問計於我：但是腹儉的我，也覺一籌莫展。用敢函請</p>
<p>先生代爲解答。倘因此而獲得良好的効果，則豈獨程君之幸，鄙人也感同身受矣。專肅即請</p>
<p>撰安　林賢釗謹上</p>
<p>×　　×　　×</p>
<p>編者按：現在有一班人，襲用了「少數服從多數」的一名口號，不顧法律的權威，動不動妄作妄爲的，實在非常之多。所以我們特地把「決議案的効力」與「法律的權威」在下面公開地討論一下：希望有這種不準確觀念的人們·趕快警醒。</p>
<p>我們要知道，任何一種會議的決議案，在法律範圍之內當然有絕大的自由權：但是一旦牠的性質，抵觸了「法律」，那末這種决議案，就不能發生効力。所以即使國家最高的國會，他的决議案，一旦違背了憲法精神，這决議就不生効力。何況區區的一個股東會議呢？由此我們可以知道，林君來信所問的問題，可以不顧股東會的决議案，而專就法律研究了。</p>
<p>這爿呢絨雜貨店，開設迄今，不過兩年。第一年滬戰尚未發生，當然不致有多大虧折：第二年據來信所說，虧蝕了五千餘金。可惜因爲來信沒有將股本總數說明，我們不能推定程君應該負責的確數；但也可知其决不會超過一千金之數。換一句話說。程君對於該店的賸餘資財，當然還有一分子的權利。現在店既虧本，除非原股單另有規定，「在幾年之內，不准折股，」程君當然可以提議退股。至退股以後，程君所有的一份賸餘資本，自可要求返還。經理或其他股東，萬一竟根據議决案，實行沒收，這是他們的侵權行爲。程君可以依法告爭，法院决不會因爲股東會的議决案，不顧程君法益的。</p>
<p>至於計算賸餘資本的辦法，可根據去年的「紅賬。」但是萬一他們預留地步，過意將生財貨物作賤，或有其他不盡不實的地方，程君還可以主張淸查呢？法律上的利益，决不因他們的决議案，而有所搖動的。</p>

<h3>詩禮人家（十八續）</h3>
<p>— 汪仲賢</p>
<p>「太太，你今天又有應酬嗎？」</p>
<p>「都是爲了要救你出來，才去結交了許多闊人的太太，今天是莫太太請客，莫老爺就是打電報去保你出來的人，我能不去應酬嗎？」</p>
<p>「我不是不許你出去，不過你也要可憐我一點！我現在是一個殘廢的人了，事事都要人侍候帮忙·丫頭們作事都不大貼心，我不願意差她們；小姐雖肯貼心服侍我，只是她年紀大了，總有許多不便，我又不敢多差遣她，你最好是少出去應酬幾次，留在家裏陪陪我吧，你把這困苦情形，說給人家聽了，人家也會原諒你的，」</p>
<p>若華太太將眼睛一翻，說道：「你瘋癱在床上！敎別人也陪你瘋癱嗎？眞是氣數！」</p>
<p>「我同你是夫妻呵……」</p>
<p>她急忙搶着說道：「你是老頭兒，我是老太婆了，還肉麻個什麼勁兒呢？你有病，不是我害你的，我願意替你害病，你把病移到我身上來吧，我願意天天躺着，决不要你來服侍我，由你天天出去，吃花酒也罷，逛鹹肉莊也罷，我决不來干涉你，一個人總要放得漂亮些，爲什麼這樣想不開呢？你又不是吃奶的小孩子，時進刻刻吊着我不放幹什麼？」</p>
<p>仲南再要與她說話時，她已經翩若驚鴻地走了，仲南只望着她歎了一口長氣，恰巧幼中來了，見哥哥眉頭緊蹙，險上十分不快，問他爲了何事，仲南連連搖頭歎息道：</p>
<p>「家門不幸！」</p>
<p>幼中又追問他什麼不幸，他便問道：</p>
<p>「我與你嫂子分開了一年多，近來她的態度大變，我猜她也許有了不端的行爲，你是常常到我家裏來的，可聽見什麼風聲沒有？」</p>
<p>幼中聽了不禁將臉脹得通紅，囁嚅答道：</p>
<p>「大概不致於吧！」</p>
<p>「你脹紅了臉，怔了半天，才答應一句話出來，」大概你總知道，不願意說出來罷了，其實你儘管告訴我　，常言道，　兄弟如手足，妻子如衣服，我同你是手足，難道你還帮着她蒙蔽我嗎？」</p>
<p>幼中心裏眞是萬分慚愧，低着頭不敢抬起來望哥哥的臉，仲南看了，心裏越發疑惑，逼着問道：</p>
<p>「我知道，你是怕我們夫婦傷和氣，所以不肯實說出來，其實，你即使告訴了我，我也不會去難爲她，我是一個極愛面子的人，斷不會把這不名譽事張楊出去，况且我是一個半死的人了，我還能與她分離嗎？你若告訴我啊了我也不過警戒她一番，敎她赶緊改過，不要再與人往來，也就完了，你說吧！」</p>
<p>幼中此時恨不得有一個地洞鑽了進去，低了頭只在想圓成一個謊，架不住仲南一再催問，逼得無法可想，只得說道：</p>
<p>「別人我都不疑心，只是那個姓鄭的小夥子，據嫂子說是她的姨姪，常常在此地穿房入室的走動，別的人我可不知道，」</p>
<p>「那是鄭濟平，我知道的確是她姊姊的兒子，他今年才十七歲，决不會是他·他常來我家，我也常見着他，他有意要娶黛秋做妻子若華同我商量過，若華也肯了，只是黛秋本人還不大願意，這個小孩子很規矩，你疑惑錯了！」　　幼中聽了心裏突的一跳，他還沒有知道這姓鄭的小孩子是來追逐黛秋的，仲南沒有探訪得情敵是誰，幼中倒打聽得一個情敵出來了，此時黛秋嫋嫋婷婷的走了進來，幼中有了脫身的機會，推說有事，告辭出來，一脚到小房子裏去見若華·（未完）</p>

<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評生路（原名人生大道Road　to　Life）</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>蘇聯的生路昨天在上海大戲院，試映了，因爲是執行新聞記者，所以我也榮幸的得去觀光。當我走出戲院來，我深深感覺到一種新的啟示。　　這劇本的故事，是如何的生動而有力啊！沒有戀愛，沒有女人的大腿各紳士的高帽或夜禮服，反之，它有的是强壯而歡樂的人羣，有的燦爛面光輝的靑春之力的活躍。</p>
<p>這片中的主題是如此偉大。一羣因第一次世界大戰的摧殘而流離失所的流浪的兒童們，爲了要在飢寒中掙扎着·爲了要生活下去，於是不得不從事偷竊，搶劫，以至於殺人。無疑義的這不是良心或道德的問題，面昌一個嚴重的經濟問題，於是在五年計劃的努力建設中，這一羣流浪兒也在循循善誘的敎育之下而成爲社會主義的建設者。但是在他們努力的進程中遇着許多嚴重的阻礙，然而因爲他們有着堅決果敢的精神與明瞭的認識終於在幾次的犧牲之後而達成功。</p>
<p>當然，這是一部負有偉大的敎育使命的影片，是一部大衆自己的作品。</p>
<p>至於在演出的技巧方面，也有着最大的成功。導演在這中間顯着一種强有力的而又不失之精細的手腕。他指揮着廣大的羣衆，幾乎每一場都是羣衆的動作。我們知道，這的確不是一椿容易的工作，假如想運用人羣而又使每個羣衆都充分的表現出來。</p>
<p>這中間沒有一個自頭至尾獨當一面的主角，當然這是歐美的電影所不能做到的。其中那個流浪兒的領袖雖然是鏡頭較多，然而决不是許多人都爲他而表演以致他成爲一個英雄，他不過是本片中比較重要的罷了。關於演員們個別的表演，都可以說是恰到好處。他們在建設工作中表現出歡樂而壯健的精神，他們在困難中也表現出大無畏而有信心。</p>
<p>至於其他方面，有好些鏡頭都是適合於美的條件的。如黑夜荒郊的搏鬥，如火車之斜面奔來等。收音淸脆瞭朗，特別是那黑夜的搖車上的歌聲，流浪兒的合唱，以及淸晨絕早的鳥啼（取景亦美）。燈光能夠極其靈活的運用，雖然很少有柔和的光線，正相反，却多是統一的力的照射。至於少年們在樹巔上嬉遊，工廠中的騷動，會食時的拋擲盆碗，築鐵路時一面歌唱一面流汗的情形，都是頂好的場面。</p>
<p>在中俄復交之後，我們能夠多看這種民衆敎育的影片，乃是値得我們歡喜的，中國的電影藝術家可以在這中間學習新的技巧，觀衆更可知道除了好萊無塢的歌舞瘋狂之外還有這種含有重大意義的影片存在。</p>

<h3>談談「慾潮」</h3>
<p>— 蔣靑</p>
<p>當我們看過那兩部眞正道地的德國烏發公司的片子「霓裳仙子」「龍翔鳳舞」時，我們感覺到那種維也納氣派底音樂歌舞的浪漫喜劇，的確是富麗堂皇得堪稱烏發公司的傑搆。我們現在，竟又能欣賞那烏發第三部曲，同時，又是依密爾雅寗斯的新作——「慾潮」，這怎能說不是我們的眼福。</p>
<p>在「慾潮」裏我們看到的是另一種風味。是在下級社會中的大衆，無論男和女，所具有的一種狂放的肉慾與痴愛。這裏面絕對談不到什麼公子哥兒的風流艷事。</p>
<p>這部片子的情節富有刺激性，緊張非常。當你看見那竊犯出獄親眼看見他的愛人和別人親暱的表情，你定可受不少重大的刺激。那女人的濫施愛情爲的是求肉慾的滿足。他們所處的社會是極卑陋黑暗的，可是你看完了所受到的感慨，恐怕亦不免要一掬同情之淚吧。</p>
<p>說到各人的表情。雅寗斯在各幕中的動作都非常有力，尤其是出獄後啼笑皆非的表情，同和情敵搏鬥諸幕，又緊張，又刺激，這種爲了高漲的慾潮，忘記了理智的控制的內心表現，使你非常興奮。那配角安娜史坦在我們雖覺很面生，但她那熱烈的表情，是這片中重大的帮助。攝影的光度配置得宜，使這貧民窟式的影片增加了不少的美化。</p>
<h3>評「如此英雄」</h3>
<p>— 玉虹</p>
<p>中國人根據着祖傳的「摹仿」天性，也應時的產生出一對的東方勞力哈台，而接着演出了這一部滑稽的「如此英雄」。</p>
<p>這片的劇情是很簡單的。述兩個窮光蛋因尋狗而尋人，在這狗與人的中間，造成了他們倆的英名，同時產生了許多的笑料。在表情與動作方面劉繼羣是完全失敗的。原因都發生在「硬作」兩個字上。韓蘭根本來是舞台上的一個滑稽家，在這片裏有很大的供獻，雖然有些地方未免做作點，但站在滑稽的立場上，不能不說他是一個好脚色。其次說到談瑛在這片內，除了描了兩個可怕的黑眼圈外，並未見得有如何高明的表情。再則全劇中不合理情的地方也很不少。但結總言之，在中國滑稽人才高眠未起的時候，有這一部差强人意的作品，也足以滿足觀衆的慾望了！</p>
<h3>琪恩哈羅將染髮</h3>
<p>— 羅芬</p>
<p>金髮女郎琪恩哈羅自從她的丈夫保羅博恩自殺慘死之後，想不出保羅畢竟爲了什麼要自殺的緣故，外界雖然有各種猜想，並且以爲琪恩自己肚裏終明白，但是琪恩實在不知道保羅的心理。近來琪恩忽然遷怒於自己黃金色的頭髮要想拿金色染成深褐色。據她自己對人說，保羅會在生前說黃色的頭髮是不祥的，或者保羅的慘死是和金髮有關係的，所以她决定染去黃金色。</p>
<h3>電影與文學趣味</h3>
<p>— 黃震遐</p>
<p>㈥慾潮</p>
<p>這是一張烏發描寫柏林「地下層」生活的力作，愛密耳雅寗斯是飾着壮年人，作風和他從前與莉亞特普地合演的Vaudeville(風流女伶）差不多，很有世界性，凡是生活在大都巿裏的人們都很容易感到共鳴。</p>
<p>故事展開的程序是如此：一個柏林的天才的竊賊（愛密耳雅寗斯），和一個來自俄國的小女人安娜（安娜斯坦）姘在一起，過着家庭式的生活。但安娜因爲年輕貌美，故對於物質的要求是有着很大的慾念，同時又以竊賊爲討其歡心起見，常常瞞着她去偷竊美麗的物品，以致多次入獄。拋冷靜的她被慾潮所驅使，就屢屢地演出了軋姘頭的把戲，最後連自己男人的徒弟都偷了，竊賊發現這種事，而且也感到了生的厭倦，就乖乖地自投法網，從事「休養」</p>
<p>故事的梗概是這樣，愛密耳雅寗斯烘托着暴風雨般的人之情緒，以及最後的幻滅，深刻極了。安娜斯坦聽說本來是蘇聯國籍，但在這片裏却澈底的變成了一位典型的德國少婦，一舉一動竟全是柏林式的靈巧，頑皮，也是柏林式的愛嬌與時髦。唱的那首流行小曲：「我不屬於任何男子，也許任何男子都佔有我一點」，也祇是用德國式比較溫和的旋律哼出。</p>
<p>對白是用德語，當然以缺乏語言常識的我們是聽不懂，然而因此却可以留心到德國人，尤其是柏林「地下層」階級</p>
<p>的風俗舉動習慣，以及一切日常起居生活的態度，增進不少對於異國情調的了解。最高興的，就是我們又發現了烏發的一位天才，那就是：蘇俄的安娜斯坦</p>
<h3>看影戲常識</h3>
<p>— 歐陽錦屏</p>
<p>在十分無聊的時候，我們或許會踏到影院裏消遣消遣。下面的幾項事情，大家可有注意沒有？</p>
<p>㈠領了小兒女到影院內，切不可讓他站在椅上。因爲有礙後一排看客的視線，而惹別人的討厭。</p>
<p>㈡影戲在開映了。高聲談話，應絕對停止。否則有聲片的對白，等於沒用。</p>
<p>㈢在影院裏，最好不吃甚麼零食。否則瓜菓殻狼藉滿地，看客有時踏着而致傾跌。所以要零食時，最好吃些易於消化的糖果。</p>
<p>㈣狂呼捲烟，有碍娛樂場所的公共衛生；更令不吸烟的人們難過。</p>
<p>㈤隨地吐涶，高聲咳嗽，也是不衛生的動作。</p>
<p>㈥看到出神的時候，切勿跳呌狂呼。</p>
<p>㈦遇到片中的字幕，祇可心裏默誦，切勿視作學校功課一般，琅琅讀出。不十分懂英文的，尤不可操生硬的語音。</p>

<h3>League of Nations Report Draft Completed</h3>
<p>To be Submitted to the Special Committee for Review Today</p>
<p>General Assembly Scheduled for the 20th</p>
<p>Recommendations Explicitly Deny the Puppet State and Invite the US and Russia to Participate; Japan Shows No Remorse, Firm on Recognizing "Manchukuo"</p>
<p>(Geneva) The drafting committee of nine has completed its work. The report has been finalized and is scheduled to be submitted to the Committee of Nineteen on Monday. It will be submitted to the Extraordinary Assembly at the end of next week. It has also been decided to recommend to the Assembly that the United States and Soviet Russia send representatives to participate. It is expected that the meeting of the Committee of Nineteen will last for two days, and the Extraordinary Assembly will also require three or four days of discussion. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The drafting committee of nine completed the entire draft of the report on the evening of the 11th, and it will be submitted to the Special Committee of Nineteen for review on Monday (the 13th), and then submitted to the General Assembly for approval. The General Assembly will be held on the 20th of this month. The main points of the draft recommendations are as follows: ㈠ The League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, and the resolutions of the League of Nations must be strictly observed. ㈡ The ten principles in Chapter IX of the Lytton Report should be regarded as principles established by the League of Nations itself. ㈢ A negotiating committee should be established to mediate. If negotiations fail, the disputed issues should be submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly for public judgment, which can be decided without the participation of both parties. ㈣ The most important task of the negotiating committee is negotiation, including (A) establishing a new governing body and returning sovereignty over Manchuria to China, and (B) withdrawing Japanese troops to the railway zone. ㈤ The negotiating committee will be organized by the four major powers, four minor powers, the United States, Russia, and the two parties involved. (Central News Agency Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Conclusion in Full</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The full text of the conclusion of the report by the nine-member subcommittee is divided into ten sections as follows:</p>
<p>㈠ The Sino-Japanese dispute submitted to the League of Nations General Assembly originated in Manchuria. Manchuria is considered by both China and foreign countries as part of China, under the sovereignty of the Chinese government.</p>
<p>In its written opinion on the report of the Commission of Inquiry, the Japanese government raised a point of contention, arguing that the rights previously granted by China to Russia and subsequently obtained by Japan, within a very limited area, namely the so-called South Manchurian Railway Zone, actually conflicted with Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<p>In fact, these rights arose from Chinese authority. The rights China previously granted to Russia and subsequently to Japan, in fact, arose from Chinese sovereignty.</p>
<p>Under the 1905 Treaty of Beijing, the Chinese government agreed to Russia's transfer of various rights to Japan in accordance with the Treaty of Portsmouth. In 1905, Japan directly requested China to expand its rights in Manchuria and concluded a treaty with the Chinese government on May 25, 1915, regarding South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia.</p>
<p>Japan relinquished some major rights in South Manchuria and Eastern Inner Mongolia at the Washington Conference, stating that its decision was based on the concepts of fairness and moderation. Japan consistently considered China's sovereignty and the principle of equal opportunity.</p>
<p>The Nine-Power Treaty applies to Manchuria as it applies to other parts of China.</p>
<p>Finally, in the early stages of the current dispute, Japan never argued that Manchuria was not an integral part of China. Japan even advocated that the dispute should be resolved by the two parties concerned, namely China and Japan.</p>
<p>㈡ In recording these facts, the League of Nations General Assembly has not forgotten the custom of Manchurian autonomy. In an extreme case, this custom has made autonomy possible. For example, Zhang Zuolin, in the name of China's autonomous three eastern provinces, concluded an agreement with Russia on September 20, 1924, regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway, navigation, and border demarcation.</p>
<p>However, judging from the provisions of this agreement, it is clear that the government of the three eastern provinces did not regard itself as a subordinate government of China, but believed that it could and should negotiate with Russia on issues related to China's interests in the three eastern provinces, considering that the central government had also concluded an agreement with Russia on certain issues months before.</p>
<p>This Manchurian autonomy can also be seen in administration. Zhang Zuolin's successive declarations of independence were never interpreted as his own or the Manchurian people's desire to separate from China.</p>
<p>Although Manchuria has gone through successive wars and periods of independence, it has always been an integral part of China. Since 1928, Zhang Xueliang has also recognized the authority of the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>㈢ In the twenty-five years before September 1931, the political and economic ties between Manchuria and China became increasingly strong, and Japanese interests in Manchuria continued to develop. Under the Republic of China, the three eastern provinces opened their doors to people from all provinces, and Chinese people, owning land, made Manchuria a simple extension of China south of the Great Wall in many ways.</p>
<p>Among the approximately 30 million people, it is estimated that Chinese or assimilated Manchus account for 28 million.</p>
<p>Under the rule of Zhang Zuolin and Zhang Xueliang, the Chinese people and their interests became more important in developing Manchuria's economic resources than before.</p>
<p>㈣ During this period, Japan also acquired or demanded rights within Manchuria, which restricted the implementation of Chinese sovereignty to an extraordinary degree, as the actions of the Kwantung Government in practice amounted to complete sovereignty.</p>
<p>Japan managed the railway zone along the South Manchurian Railway, including several towns, and important parts of prosperous cities such as Shenyang and Changchun.</p>
<p>In these places, Japan exercised jurisdiction over police affairs, taxes, education, and public utilities.</p>
<p>Japan stationed armed forces in some parts of the three eastern provinces, with the Kwantung Army in the leased territory, railway guards in the railway zone, and consular police teams in various places.</p>
<p>If both sides were willing to have and accept a policy of close economic and political cooperation, then this situation could continue without leading to disputes and endless controversies. Otherwise, it would inevitably lead to mutual misunderstandings and conflicts.</p>
<p>The interconnection of rights between the two sides, the ambiguity of legal status, and the increasingly conflicting ideas of the Japanese regarding their special status and the Chinese regarding their nationalistic claims became the source of various incidents and disputes.</p>
<p>Before September 18, 1931, both sides had legitimate grievances. Japan took advantage of its questionable rights, and China obstructed the implementation of its unquestionable rights.</p>
<p>Before the September 18 Incident, efforts were made to resolve the outstanding issues through diplomatic and peaceful means, but these efforts were not exhausted. However, tensions increased, and Japan asserted that it would resort to force if necessary.</p>
<p>㈤ The current period is one of transition and national construction for China. Although there is a central government and considerable progress, political turmoil is unavoidable, and a policy of international cooperation needs to be adopted.</p>
<p>One of the results of this policy will be the continued provision of technical assistance by the League of Nations to China at its request, to reform its systems and enable the Chinese people to transform and consolidate their country.</p>
<p>The policy of international cooperation initiated by the Washington Conference has been slow to be fully understood. This is especially due to the frequent and violent anti-foreign propaganda and the economic exclusion practiced by China, as well as the anti-foreign education in schools, which have also contributed to the atmosphere in which the current dispute arose. The guiding principles of the Washington Conference are still necessary today.</p>
<p>㈥ The boycotts before September 18, expressing resentment over certain events or supporting certain demands, inevitably increased the already tense situation.</p>
<p>The boycotts after September 18 were a form of retaliation. It must be said that, from a general observation of international relations, violent plans inevitably lead to opposing violent plans.</p>
<p>㈦ The provisions of the League of Nations Covenant regarding the resolution of disputes are intended to prevent international tensions from escalating into what seems to be an inevitable rupture.</p>
<p>The Commission of Inquiry found that every dispute can be resolved through arbitration. The more disputes that accumulate, the greater the tension. Therefore, when a country that considers itself harmed experiences prolonged diplomatic negotiations, its responsibility is to call the League of Nations' attention to the situation. Article 12 of the League of Nations Covenant does contain a formal obligation regarding the peaceful resolution of disputes.</p>
<p>㈧ Including the possibility that Japanese military officers on the night of September 18 believed that their actions were lawful self-defense, the military actions taken by Japanese troops in Shenyang and elsewhere in Manchuria on that night cannot be considered a plan of self-defense. Even the entire Japanese military plan that developed in the course of the dispute cannot be regarded as stemming from self-defense. Furthermore, the adoption of a lawful self-defense plan does not exempt a country from its obligations under Article 12 of the Covenant.</p>
<p>㈨ After September 18, the activities of the Japanese military authorities in civil and military affairs were motivated by genuine political reasons.</p>
<p>Gradual military occupation has removed all important cities from Chinese jurisdiction, and civil administration has been reorganized immediately after occupation.</p>
<p>Groups of Japanese civil and military officials planned, organized, and implemented an independence movement in Manchuria as a solution to the situation in Manchuria after the September 18 Incident. For this reason, they used the names and activities of some well-known Chinese, a small number of people, and local groups dissatisfied with Chinese administration.</p>
<p>This movement was assisted and guided by the Japanese Army General Staff and was only realized due to the presence of Japanese troops. It cannot be regarded as a naturally occurring and genuine independent movement.</p>
<p>㈩ The government of Manchukuo, which was created by the above-mentioned movement, now has all its main powers in the hands of Japanese officials and advisors, who effectively control administrative positions everywhere.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the Chinese people of Manchuria, who constitute the vast majority of the population, do not support this government and regard it as a puppet in the hands of the Japanese. Although Manchukuo has been recognized by Japan since the Commission of Inquiry completed its report, it has not been recognized by any other country. This should be noted. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Contents of the Recommendations</h3>
<p>(Geneva) According to reliable sources from the French side, the draft recommendations prepared by the nine-member drafting committee consists of three chapters.</p>
<p>The first section of the first chapter states the provisions of the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, and the Washington Nine-Power Treaty regarding the territorial integrity of China, and states that all these principles should be observed. The second section states the resolution of the Special General Assembly of the League of Nations on March 11, 1932, and states that this resolution should also be observed. The third section states the ten principles in Chapter IX of the Lytton Report, which have been adopted by the General Assembly as necessary conditions for a satisfactory solution.</p>
<p>The first section of the second chapter recommends the establishment of a "Negotiating Committee" to establish an autonomous government in accordance with China's sovereignty over Manchuria, maintain order, and safeguard Japan's legitimate interests. The second section recommends that the committee should first deal with the withdrawal of Japanese troops to within the South Manchurian Railway Zone. The third section recommends the implementation of the other principles in Chapter IX of the Lytton Report. The fourth section stipulates that the negotiating committee should promote direct negotiations between China and Japan. In case of difficulties, the committee should immediately report to the General Assembly for a decision. The issue of the committee's powers, organization, and jurisdiction was hotly debated by the drafting committee. Finally, it was decided to give it the power to resolve the entire Sino-Japanese relationship. It was stipulated that the negotiating committee should be composed of representatives of various countries appointed by the Extraordinary Assembly, and it was proposed to the General Assembly that representatives be designated from the countries that signed the Washington Nine-Power Treaty and the members of the Committee of Nineteen. It was also decided to invite the Soviet government to participate. After the negotiating committee is so formed, representatives from China and Japan must also be added, so that the committee does not have the power of arbitration. A deadline is set for when the committee's mission is completed, and its duties are only completed when it submits a report to the General Assembly.</p>
<p>The third chapter recommends to all member states of the League of Nations that they not recognize "Manchukuo" and take no action that would hinder the work of the negotiating committee. Non-member states of the League of Nations will also be asked to adopt the same attitude. (Havas Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The nine-member subcommittee of the Committee of Nineteen met for three hours on the 11th and completed its important report with unanimous consent, which was something that few people could have believed possible months ago. The points that still need final revision are a few points concerning the negotiating committee. The drafting committee met at 3:30 p.m. and held a three-hour meeting. The recommendations have also been completed and will be submitted to the plenary meeting of the Committee of Nineteen on Sunday.</p>
<p>〓Recommendations Based on the Spirit of the Covenant〓 The basis adopted by the recommendations is the League of Nations Covenant, the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the Nine-Power Treaty, the declaration of the late French Prime Minister Briand on December 10, 1931, the resolution of the League of Nations General Assembly on March 11, 1932, and the Lytton Report. The recommendations specifically mention Principle VII of Chapter IX of the Lytton Report, namely that the new civil administration system in Manchuria should be organized to suit Chinese administration and land sovereignty, and Japan's special interests there.</p>
<p>〓Organize a Committee to Urge Negotiations〓 The recommendations urge both parties to begin negotiations with the assistance of the committee designated by the League of Nations General Assembly to seek a resolution of the dispute. Non-member states and non-signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact and the Nine-Power Treaty (i.e., the United States and Russia) may also be invited to join the negotiations in this committee. If the committee reaches a deadlock, it may report it to the League of Nations General Assembly. Member states of the League of Nations agree not to take actions inconsistent with these recommendations, and agree to continue not recognizing the existing system in Manchuria. The negotiating committee will be organized by the Secretary-General of the League of Nations within one month after the passage of this report. The above is the gist of the recommendations.</p>
<p>〓Sanction Clauses Generally Understood〓 However, the nine-member subcommittee also discussed many other points, and paid particular attention to how to deal with the situation if either party rejects the recommendations. It is reported that the subcommittee has agreed that the League of Nations Covenant stipulates a three-month period of hesitation, which should be counted from the date of the League of Nations General Assembly's adoption of this report. Dr. Motta, the Swiss representative, raised the issue of compulsory arbitration, but no decision was made, and the question of whether the Committee of Nineteen should continue to consider it was also not decided. The number of members of the negotiating committee will be determined by the League of Nations, but it is expected that it will not exceed twelve. The participants will be the countries most concerned about the Far East, and will probably be filled by the representatives of various countries stationed in China. Although people generally do not want to mention the possibility of adopting the sanctions clauses of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, it is understood that this issue cannot be ignored, lest the negotiations fail. The remaining points of the report are the same as those already seen in the telegrams.</p>
<p>〓The Report is Divided into Four Sections in Total〓 The report begins with a preface, stating the process of failing to mediate and having to use Section 4 of Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant to prepare the report. The first section traces the past events in the Far East and cites the full text of the first eight chapters of the Lytton Report, pointing out that this is a fair and complete record of the background of the Sino-Japanese dispute. The second section discusses the events in Geneva and the historical relations in the rest of the Far East in order to explain the reasons why the Executive Yuan and the General Assembly have repeatedly passed resolutions, and cites the consular report on the Shanghai Incident to supplement the events that occurred after the Lytton Report was compiled. There is also a brief account of the Shanhaiguan Incident and the news that Japan intends to occupy Jehol. The third section is the conclusion, and the fourth section is the recommendations. (Reuters Dispatch, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japan Decides to Fight the League of Nations</h3>
<p>Expressing Willingness to Bear Any Cost</p>
<p>Firm on Not Abandoning "Manchukuo"</p>
<p>Reply to be Issued on the Evening of the 13th</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to reliable sources here today, Japan's reply to the inquiry from the Committee of Nineteen will announce to the world in stern and clear terms its determination to maintain the independence of "Manchukuo" at any cost. It is also heard that Japan will declare in advance that it will not be bound by the recommendations of the League of Nations or change its policy in this regard. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a joint meeting of the Army and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in the afternoon to decide on the principles of the reply. Director of the Asian Bureau Tani is responsible for drafting it. The ministerial meeting will be held again tomorrow morning to revise it, and then it will be submitted to the Provisional Cabinet Meeting for a decision. After being approved by the Emperor of Japan, it is scheduled to be issued as a telegram in the evening of the 13th. The outline of the telegram is as follows: ㈠ Japan's new proposal is not to accept the principles of Chapter IX of the Lytton Report, but only agrees to use the report as a reference. ㈡ Japan formally recognizes the independence of "Manchukuo" as an accomplished fact. The Japanese government cannot revoke this fact or abolish "Manchukuo." Therefore, Principle VII of the ten principles in Chapter IX of the Lytton Report cannot be recognized. ㈢ Recognizing "Manchukuo" as an independent country is Japan's national policy. The Japanese representatives have repeatedly stated this in the past three months. All countries should have understood this, so there is no need to say more. ㈣ The purpose of the questionnaire from the Committee of Nineteen is to shake Japan's national policy. Japan cannot recognize this.</p>
<p>Therefore, the responsibility lies with the League of Nations. (China United Press Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japanese People Shocked and Uneasy</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is generally believed that the recommendations drafted by the drafting committee are tantamount to a clear rebuke of Japan's policy of aggression in Manchuria. The fact that the Committee of Nineteen has strong opinions and that the major powers in the drafting committee, including Britain and France, seem to favor a stronger attitude of the League of Nations towards Japan has shocked the Japanese people here. According to the current situation, the General Assembly seems likely to accept the committee's recommendations. If so, it is expected that Japan will immediately withdraw from the League of Nations, or at least withdraw its representatives attending the League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference. (National News Agency Dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Japan Wants to Save Face, But Is the League of Nations Willing to Lose Face?</h3>
<p>British Political Commentator Publishes His Views</p>
<p>(London) Famous political writer Stead published his views in the Sunday Times today, saying that the tone of the recommendations of the League of Nations subcommittee on the Sino-Japanese dispute is a clear indication of a change in the attitude of certain major powers in the past few weeks. This change has had an impact in Tokyo, where threats of withdrawal from the League of Nations have recently become less strong than before. Political circles in Tokyo have deeply realized the danger of Japan being at odds with the world in the past month. Therefore, it is not possible to say that Japan will inevitably reject the subcommittee's recommendations, but it is highly likely. If the League of Nations continues to maintain its unanimous opinion, it should be able to create an acceptable solution. The Japanese government may feel that the cancellation of the recognition of "Manchukuo" is too much of a loss of face. This consideration is certainly important, but the League of Nations itself should consider whether it will lose face throughout the world if it admits its inability to promote a solution or continues to recognize a major power that disregards its authority as a member of its Executive Council. (Reuters Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>The Issue of Japan's Withdrawal</h3>
<p>The Minseito Party Opposes a Decision by the Diet</p>
<p>Advocating That the Government Be Allowed to Handle It Properly</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the situation in the League of Nations became tense, the militarist members of the Seiyukai Party have advocated that the Diet should decide on the withdrawal from the League of Nations. As this concerns diplomatic strategy, the leaders of the Seiyukai Party have not dared to express their opinions lightly. The Minseito Party is absolutely opposed to this, on the grounds that if the Diet makes a decision, the government will lose its freedom, and the threat of withdrawing from the League of Nations will lose its deterrent effect. If the government complies with the resolution of the Diet and cannot withdraw in time, it will also raise the issue of the Diet's authority. Therefore, it is better to let the government handle it properly, so as not to create other contradictions. (China United Press Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>US Fleet Remains in the Pacific, Japan Deliberately Shows Composure</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The US government has decided to keep the Atlantic Fleet stationed in the Atlantic Ocean until July 1 of next year. Regarding this matter, the Japanese naval authorities stated that no one in the world believes that the US Navy is keeping the Atlantic Fleet stationed in the Pacific in order to save a mere 400,000 yuan. The US is announcing this plan at a time when relations between Japan and the League of Nations are tense, which is of great significance. However, the Japanese authorities will not be embarrassed or indignant by this, and will continue to pay attention to the attitude of the League of Nations. (Japan United Press Dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>US Government Hinders the Shipment of Arms to China and Japan</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Stimson has decided to detain arms shipments to belligerent countries and has prepared a memorandum on this matter, which has recently been revealed by the New York "Public Opinion Forum." The belligerent countries referred to by Stimson are an allusion to Manchuria and the dispute between Peru and Colombia over Leticia. Stimson said that international events rely on the dissemination of newspapers, and the world knows who the aggressor is, so it is easier to determine. Regarding this matter, the League of Nations General Assembly's judgment is something that can be fully realized. Stimson also said that the old concept of strict neutrality is no longer feasible, because any blockade of seaports in international wars is sufficient to threaten the commerce of neutral countries. Stimson's opinion is supported by Hoover, but there are still opponents. (Havas Dispatch, 11th)</p>

<h3>The Jehol Problem and the Final Resolution</h3>
<p>Therefore,</p>
<p>Speaking of the overall situation, there are only two paths for the final resolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute. Disregarding gains and losses, unafraid of sacrifice, breaking the cauldrons and sinking the boats, to seek a battle. This is one. Ceding the Northeast, securing a partial peace within the Pass, bearing humiliation, and kneeling to seek peace. This is another. However, neither making peace nor waging war, watching and hesitating, has led to today's situation.</p>
<p>National affairs should not be rashly and carelessly handled to seek temporary relief. Watching and hesitating may also have its profound significance. But what is its significance? Enduring passively, hoping for the awakening of the powerful enemy? Then, starting with non-resistance and losing the three provinces, followed by not firing a single shot and abandoning Jinzhou. Recently, in the Battle of Yuguan, resistance was only added when enemy soldiers climbed the city walls. Patience can be said to have reached its limit. However, after the fall of Yuguan, there was the attack on Jiukou. Recently, there have been determined preparations to attack Jehol. Gaining an inch and advancing a foot, the more we show weakness, the more rampant they become. Their intentions are already very clear. Are we going to use the precedents of the Jinan Incident and the Shanghai Incident, saying that enemy troops will eventually withdraw from our territory? Then, one must know that the three northeastern provinces in the minds of the Japanese people are completely incomparable to Jinan and Shanghai. And the causes of the Jinan Incident and the Shanghai Incident, and the resulting situation, are also far less serious than the Mukden Incident. Are we going to wait for international justice to impose sanctions? Then, after more than a year of appeals in Geneva and running around in European and American metropolises, internally, we have lost more and more land; externally, international public opinion has turned indifferent. The League of Nations' handling of Japan is also becoming increasingly weak. Procrastination only breeds opportunities for the Japanese to collude with the great powers. Are we going to wait for the outbreak of a world war to reap the benefits? Then, waiting for rabbits to crash into trees, for what year will we wait? Soviet Russia's policy towards Japan is to consider tolerance as a blessing. America's Far East policy will probably be limited to verbal protests. The war in the Far East will not see the participation of a third country until the coastal and river areas of China are entirely in a state of war. Our desire to hope that any country will take the heroic action of starting a war for righteousness is tantamount to quenching thirst with plums. And since the object of war is China, the so-called benefit of the fisherman also depends on our ability to strive for strength. Otherwise, the trampling of one country is not enough, and it will turn into a battleground for the great powers to compete. Are we going to say that preparations are insufficient and arrangements are not perfect, and we have to set a time limit? Then, from the September 18th Incident to today, it has been almost one year and five months. There should already be considerable arrangements. To say that we must arrange everything to be foolproof before starting a war, then the world will never have this war.</p>
<p>The Sino-Japanese dispute has reached the stage where the dagger is revealed. Externally, the League of Nations' situation can no longer be used for further perfunctory excuses. Internally, the people's anger towards Japan can no longer be appeased by empty words. To fight or to make peace? Today, we can no longer afford to watch and hesitate. What to choose and what to discard? Today, we must have a final resolution. However, examining the history of the evolution of the Sino-Japanese dispute over the years, one cannot but recognize that today's situation has no possibility of peace. Then, the so-called final resolution is also war.</p>
<p>What are the concerns of the people of the country about war today? Are they afraid of causing a world war? Then, in a world war, a strong country like Japan may perish. China, as a semi-colony, can no longer decline further. Wealthy families seek quarrels and cause trouble, while impoverished households are polite and self-restrained. Taking the overall situation as their responsibility, what could be more incongruous than this? Are they afraid that not fighting will only lose three provinces, and fighting may lose six provinces? Then, one must know that only under this half-dead, half-alive compromising situation can the Japanese safely and gradually encompass the entire country. Once the climax of struggle arises, it is unlikely that all of Japan's military strength will be able to cover the defenses of six provinces. Shidehara said that swallowing Manchuria is like swallowing a bomb, precisely because we can rise up and struggle. Are they afraid that internal unrest will make it impossible to resist foreign aggression? Then, one must know that internal unrest is precisely because foreign aggression has not been resisted. The current clamorous political opinions cannot be reconciled and united without a struggle against foreign aggression. The people under the bankrupt villages cannot hope to be content with poverty without a struggle against foreign aggression and not taking risks. What history shows us is that after depression, there must be drastic changes. Repressed public sentiment, if not channeled into foreign conflicts to seek catharsis, will inevitably lead to internal strife. In short, all the concerns are manifestations of a selfish, self-interested, and cowardly mentality. I know that the government will no longer be swayed by this kind of mentality today.</p>
<p>The lessons that recent facts have given us: First, as soon as our side in Geneva expressed a stronger stance, the League of Nations slightly changed its attitude of accommodating the Japanese in every way. Second, as soon as the Jehol generals made preparations to resist the enemy, the Japanese temporarily postponed their ambition to take Jehol. From this, we should know that inciting the struggle of the entire Chinese nation is not only something that the great powers do not want, but also something that the Japanese do not dare to do. Destroying the entire Chinese market is a significant loss for the great powers, and Japan is the main loser. With the enemy's weaknesses clear, our own situation is naturally easy to handle. What we must publicly announce to the world is that at this time of unbearable endurance, in order to survive, it is not enough to save China from danger and collapse unless we incite a nationwide resistance against Japan. Only with our determination to break the cauldrons and sink the boats can we hope that the Japanese will realize that it is not a good plan, and can we hope that the great powers will lend a helping hand. Once the struggle against foreign aggression arises, the power of the nation will naturally be displayed. Corrupt and incompetent officials will stand upright. The nation's financial and material resources can all be used for national requisition. Doubts are dispelled, and suspicions are eliminated. The nation's military and human resources can all be gathered on the anti-Japanese front. Poverty and hardship will be regarded as natural during wartime. Vagrants and idlers can all be driven during wartime. An old nation cannot be revitalized without this. A chaotic society cannot be clarified without this. The ray of hope for the Republic of China lies in this. The time is now. Compatriots, consider it carefully.</p>

<h3>U.S. Naval Chief Opposes Military Spending Cuts</h3>
<p>Supported by all naval officers</p>
<p>National News Service, Washington, 11th - Members of both the U.S. Senate and House Naval Affairs Committees today said that the turbulent situation in the Far East clearly prompted Naval Chief Adams to urgently propose to Congress that the United States' combat strength not be weakened. Adams today wrote to Senators Bingham and Baylin stating that if the austerity plan currently proposed by both the Senate and House is passed by Congress, the United States' naval strength will be reduced to only 56% of the total operational strength of the Japanese navy, and 66% of the British navy.</p>
<p>The Senate recently passed an amendment to the austerity law, stipulating that all government departments and agencies, including the Army and Navy, reduce their original budgets by 5%. Adams stated that this case will force the Navy to close some docks in the East China Sea, delay shipbuilding projects, and cause the layoffs of many shipbuilding employees. If the two houses do not reconsider, the number of idle warships will reach 82.</p>
<p>In addition, the result will severely restrict the activities of the Naval Reserve, halt the recruitment of new naval recruits, reduce the number of regular naval soldiers by 9,000, idle three battleships, two aircraft carriers, four heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, thirteen destroyers, six submarines, and two light mine-laying ships. Even the newly built large airships may need to be shelved immediately after being incorporated into the fleet. Currently, the number of idle U.S. ships has reached 49 as a result of austerity. He believes that the existing ships in the fleet cannot be idled again.</p>
<p>It is said that Adams' move has the support of all naval officers, and senior naval officers and some members of Congress believe that in order to protect national security, naval expenditures cannot be reduced any further.</p>
<p>As for Adams' case, because the amendment to the austerity law has only been passed in the Senate, there is hope of preventing Congress from finally passing it. However, Adams only intends to make naval expenditures an exception and not subject to any cuts. However, an attempt to do so in the Senate last Thursday failed.</p>
<h3>Militarism Will Not Stop! Is a World War Inevitable?</h3>
<p>Japanese Military Clique Decides to Expand Army and Navy Plans</p>
<p>Araki Wants to Make Japanese Army Combat Power Equal to the West</p>
<p>Morgan Urges the United States to Pay Attention to the Far East Crisis</p>
<p>National News Service, Pinehurst, 11th - Morgan, former U.S. Ambassador to Turkey and a prominent business and financial leader in New York, said in a speech here tonight that a world war involving the East and the West seems inevitable. This kind of war opportunity is currently brewing. The largest potential crisis in the world today, the United States should pay close attention to. The tense emotions between France and Germany may cause a major conflict. Prime Minister Hitler's advance is too rapid and he can step on the French toe at any time. Japan has lit a match in the Manchurian powder keg, which can set off a bloody battle around the world at any time. National ambition contains the element of territorial expansion, which is a dangerous thing, but a once-powerful country trying to revive also contains a crisis. The Japanese want to compete with Britain in the Far East and become a world empire. Its invasion of Chinese territory is prompted by the desire to imitate Britain's possession of India. Although Morgan dismissed the efforts to resolve the Manchurian case, he said that once the public feels that security is promising and public opinion cools down, major conflicts will easily restart. Therefore, at this time, the Manchurian and Far East affairs should be studied and closely watched.</p>
<p>(Tokyo dispatch) Army Minister Araki recently made very noteworthy remarks when answering questions from a member of the House of Representatives, saying that his policy is to make the efficiency of the Japanese army no less than that of any Western army. To achieve this goal, he intends to use the national industrial capacity to fully equip it. At the same time, he also said that the original army replenishment plan required 530 million yuan, but following the government's wishes, this number was reduced to 410 million yuan, to be funded in two fiscal years, 1933-1934 and 1934-35.</p>
<p>Araki's statement that he wants to make the efficiency of the Japanese army equal to any Western army seems to have special significance. At a time when financial concerns do not allow for any increase in military spending, there is a resolution to implement the army replenishment, which is undoubtedly due to the military efficiency set in the Soviet Union's Second Five-Year Plan.</p>
<p>Judging by the standards of Western armies, the Japanese army is still backward in terms of equipment. Due to the inadequacy of equipment, training is also behind. Although physical strength, military discipline, and morale are no less than those of other countries' armies, the Japanese General Staff now feels that the situation is changing rapidly. Before the Manchurian Incident in September 1931, Japan believed that the Japanese army only needed to confront the Chinese army, which was not well-trained, disciplined, and supplied, or the Russian army, which was also not good in combat power. Therefore, the Japanese military authorities were unwilling to excessively imitate the latest training and equipment of Western armies. However, after the Manchurian Incident and the Soviet Union's formulation of the Second Five-Year Plan, the Japanese military authorities had to consider the possibility of confronting the most modern army in areas where transportation is gradually developing in the future. This does not mean that a future Russo-Japanese war is inevitable, but the Japanese General Staff has to anticipate and prepare for it, just in case. This is why Japan has a resolution to implement an army expansion plan. (Reuters)</p>
<p>(Tokyo dispatch) According to the explanation given by the Japanese Ministry of Finance at the New Factory Expenses Committee of the Mint Bureau of the House of Representatives on the 7th, regarding the 1933 fiscal year and the necessary military expenditures for the coming year of 1934 required by the Army and Navy, the necessary expenditures for the 1934 fiscal year are as follows (unit: 1,000 yuan):</p>

<h3>Germany Flies Flags at Half-Mast to Mourn the Saar Mine Explosion Tragedy</h3>
<p>Reuters, Korrey, 11th—The massive fire caused by the explosion at the gas plant in the town of Rounkochen is now weakening and no longer spreading. However, the embers are still smoldering, and the work of excavating the victims continues. It will take several weeks to clean the streets in the vicinity of the shattered glass, rubble, tree trunks, and broken furniture.</p>
<p>Words Cannot Describe the Horror—After the initial shock, residents are now venturing out of their homes to look for their relatives. The situation is extremely tragic. Some have recounted horrific stories. One family of eight was reportedly having dinner when the disaster struck. Their house collapsed and was buried in rubble. Only an elderly grandmother was rescued alive. Before she died, she reportedly said, "We were just drinking coffee." A female teacher was hurled over several houses by the blast. Another woman, bedridden with the flu, was thrown eighty yards from her window by the force of the explosion. A tram full of passengers happened to be passing the plant when it exploded. Only the vehicle remained; all the passengers perished. The roof of a cinema was blown off, killing three people. Someone was dug out of the rubble, but he was insane and fought with his rescuers. Sixty-six bodies have now been recovered, and it is estimated that at least fifty more are buried in the rubble. A row of houses near the plant, a thousand feet long, has been completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Conflicting Rumors About the Cause—There are conflicting reports about the cause of the disaster. Some say it was caused by a carelessly handled gasoline tank that ignited a gas storage tank. Others say it was caused by recent earthquakes in southern Germany that damaged the storage tank. It is feared that those who could clarify the situation have all perished. This disaster is the worst Germany has suffered since 1921. In that year, an explosion of storage tanks killed 350 people.</p>
<p>Hindenburg Launches Relief Donation—The whole country has now lowered flags to half-mast to express mourning. President Hindenburg has launched a relief donation and has donated 100,000 marks himself. The Saar Commission has allocated 500,000 francs for relief. Families with one person killed or seriously injured will receive 1,500 francs. The town of Rounkochen has a population of 40,000 and is now extremely desolate. Police, doctors, nurses, and relatives of the victims are exhausted from rescuing the injured all night. Now, another group of people is replacing them. The entire Upper Rhine region, from Korrey to the Swiss border, felt the explosion. Almost all the glass windows in the area were shattered, which shows the magnitude of the blast.</p>
<p>French Foreign Minister Pongut Also Sends Condolences—Havas, Paris, 11th—After the explosion in the gas storage room of the Nine-Temple Steel Plant in the Saar mining area of Germany, French Foreign Minister Pongut sent a telegram of condolences to the mayor of Nine-Temple City. The French Minister of Public Works, Baka Nong, ordered the National Mining Authority of the Saar region to give 100,000 francs to the mayor of Nine-Temple City to rescue the families of the victims. As of 3 p.m., a total of 64 bodies have been found. The search is still ongoing.</p>
<h3>Hitler's Forces Control All German Administration</h3>
<p>Havas, Berlin, 11th—In the German states, only Hesse still has a premier and minister of internal affairs who are members of the Socialist Party. The federal government's intention to interfere in the state is becoming increasingly evident. The federal government is now demanding that the Hesse government grant greater freedom to right-wing groups. If the state government does not comply, Hitler may appoint an administrative chief with extensive powers in the name of the federal government to be stationed in the capital of Hesse.</p>
<p>Reuters, Berlin, 12th—The famous Communist Party organ, Red Flag Newspaper, has been suspended for two weeks by the authorities because its remarks were deemed unsatisfactory by the authorities after Hitler came to power. The reason for the suspension is that the newspaper incited the national workers to implement a general strike in order to overthrow the National Socialist Party government.</p>

<h3>A Record of the Volunteer Army's Wang and Zheng Divisions Attacking Kouwai (Nine Gates)</h3>
<p>Twice Entering the City and Ten Days of Bloody Battles, With Heavy Casualties on Both Sides</p>
<p>Special News from Xiangshui: The Northeast Volunteer Army’s Independent 8th Brigade, led by Wang Shenlu, and the 5th Route Army, led by Zheng Guilin, believed that Kouwai’s position was dangerous and should not be lost for long. They specially pledged to advance their troops to jointly attack. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>The Terrain of Kouwai: Kouwai is 30 miles northwest of Yu Pass, flat on the east and open on the west. It is surrounded by steep mountains on the west, south, and north sides, as high as thousands of feet. The peaks on the north and south sides have fortress cities facing each other. Each city has several turrets. It has the momentum of one man guarding the pass against ten thousand. The gap between the two peaks is the so-called Kouwai. There is a city on the left side of the entrance, leaning against the mountain in an oval shape, with only two gates in the east and west for access. On the right side of the entrance, there is a shallow stream like a belt, meandering eastward, swelling in summer and drying up in winter, making transportation difficult. The county chronicle calls this the Kouwai water, and the terrain is dangerous, making it a must-contested place for military strategists of past dynasties. In the 11th and 13th years of the Republic, during the conflict between Feng and Zhi, there was a bloody battle at Kouwai for ten days and nights. Finally, the Feng army occupied Kouwai, with one route entering Guan and heading east to break the Zhi army's front line, and another route advancing west to pacify Tianjin and Beijing.</p>
<p>Surprise Attack on the First Night: The Northeast Volunteer Army’s Independent 8th Brigade, originally reorganized from the Iron-Blooded Army that fought bravely with the Japanese army in Wusong with Brigade Commander Weng Zhaoyuan of the 19th Route Army, the Shanghai Citizen Volunteer Army, the Shanghai Student Volunteer Army Northeast Volunteer Group, and other units, consists of soldiers who are intellectuals with a great spirit of sacrifice and enthusiasm for anti-Japanese work. Since the signing of the Shanghai Armistice Agreement last year, they have led the way out of Guan to kill the enemy, and have made repeated achievements in battles with the Japanese army in Jinxi, Suizhong, and Qian So City. At the beginning of January, there was an incident of raiding the pass beyond the Great Wall. Commander Li rushed to reinforce. On the 25th, the army arrived at Chengzilue. Upon hearing that Kouwai was lost, the soldiers were extremely indignant, crying and pounding their chests, weeping uncontrollably. The captains of each team publicly requested Commander to lead them to Kouwai to destroy the enemy's morning meal. The Commander appreciated their ambition and invited Commander Zheng Guilin of the Volunteer Army's 5th Route Army to advance and attack together. At dusk, Commander Wang first selected 200 elite soldiers from his unit, led by Chief of Staff Yu Yizhong. At 7 p.m., they set out from Zhuanghe, traversing deep forests and steep mountains for over 50 miles. It was midnight when they arrived at Xiyangkou. They divided their troops into two routes, each attacking the east and west gates. Righteous soldiers, Shen Yingzhou on the left and Ling Yazhao on the right, bravely crossed the wall, killed several enemy sentries, seized their guns, and bravely entered the city. Their shouts shook the heavens. The Japanese army was fast asleep and unprepared. Hearing the alarm, they woke up in panic. Our army took the opportunity to pursue and attack fiercely with hand grenades and pistols. The sound of explosions filled the air, and flesh and blood flew everywhere. After an hour of fierce fighting, a regiment of the Japanese army guarding Kouwai suffered 20 to 30 casualties. Our army suffered several serious injuries. Until dawn, the 8th Division of the Japanese army in Yu Pass heard the emergency and urgently sent a reinforcement of one regiment of infantry and artillery, traveling by vehicles and horses, directly towards Kouwai, and also sent two aircraft to drop dozens of bombs on our army. Our army, lacking modern equipment, had no choice but to retreat to the nearby mountains to await reinforcements.</p>
<p>The Volunteer Army's Shen Yingzhou and Ling Yazhao Enter Kouwai after Acquiring the Fake National Flag and Japanese Military Slogans</p>
<p>Zheng's Troops Come to Aid—The next day, Commander Zheng Guilin of the Northeast Volunteer Army’s 5th Route Army urgently summoned the 3rd Brigade and 8th Brigade of his unit, originally stationed in the areas of Dadianzi, Caojiafangzi, and Huahuzhuang outside the pass, to enter the pass for aid. On the afternoon of the 28th, they arrived at Huangtuling, awaiting orders to attack Kouwai. He also ordered Deputy Commander Wu Jinzhuo of the same route to gather elite troops at Loujiagou, awaiting orders. At 11 p.m. that night, they divided their troops into two routes to attack Kouwai from both sides. Earlier, the Japanese army, having heard the news, had fortified the city walls with three layers of barbed wire, and reinforced the collapsed sections of the city walls with wood and mud. The east and west gates were tightly closed, with sandbags piled high inside to strengthen the defense. They also placed four machine guns on the city walls, and five field guns on the high ground outside the city and on the turrets of the north and south walls to defend against our army. Our army rushed down from the mountain path behind the city. Upon reaching the foot of the city, they first used axes to destroy the defensive structures, then bravely climbed the city with ladders. The Japanese army urgently swept with machine guns, but our army fought even more courageously, immediately firing hand grenades back at the city, demonstrating their power. Soldiers climbed up together, rolled in, and swung their swords. Over 20 enemies were killed, and several of our soldiers also died in battle. The enemy used searchlights to observe the surroundings and fired dozens of artillery shells at our army's positions to prevent our army from advancing. The two sides were locked in a stalemate for more than two hours. Enemy reinforcements arrived from Yu Pass, and our army met them outside the city. At dawn, they retreated to Huangtuling to rest. At around 9 p.m. on the 29th, Commander Zheng again gathered his troops at Huangtuling and advanced towards Kouwai. At midnight, the two sides began to attack. The enemy relied on heavy artillery and sharp weapons to suppress our army. The sound of artillery shook the heavens and did not stop all night. Commander Wang urgently ordered a team of elite soldiers to bypass the mountains and detour dozens of miles to the Zhantai to attack the enemy's artillery positions. Commander Zheng also ordered his unit to disperse and harass various locations, and gradually concentrate towards Xiyangkou, Tiezhangpu, and Menggong. The enemy never dared to recklessly come out of the city to meet the attack. The casualties on both sides were equal that night, but regrettably, a victory could not be achieved.</p>
<p>Continue Jointly Attacking—At noon on the 30th, Commander Wang of the Independent 8th Brigade and Commander Zheng Guilin of the 5th Route Army agreed in Xiangshui that the two armies would continue to attack Kouwai that night. In the afternoon, Commander Wang believed that to repel the enemy, it was necessary to first seize their artillery positions, so that the enemy would have nothing to rely on, and our army could enter the city and engage the enemy in close combat. He ordered two staff officers to lead the captains of each battalion to reconnoiter the enemy's artillery positions near Kouwai in order to determine the attack strategy. At around 9 p.m. that night, over a hundred elite soldiers were selected from each of the four battalions of the 8th Brigade to attack the designated enemy artillery positions in separate routes. At around 10 p.m., a portion of the 5th Route Army gathered at Majiawan and attacked Kouwai from the southeast. Unexpectedly, the enemy had long foreseen our intentions and had already moved their established positions. The enemy reinforced with 300 soldiers and fired over a dozen flares, immediately bombarding our army's positions with heavy artillery. Our army also returned fire with mortars. Throughout the night, neither side was able to get close, and there were casualties on both sides. At dawn the next day, the 8th Division of the enemy army came from Yu Pass with four armored vehicles, followed by more than four hundred cavalry and infantry. Our soldiers were extremely brave and fought fiercely at the narrow passes. All of the armored vehicles were destroyed, and over ten enemy guns were captured, and over twenty enemies were killed. Our army retreated into the mountains to its original defense.</p>
<p>Final Bloody Battle—On February 1st, the 5th Route Army, led by Zheng Guilin, changed its strategy because the defenses of Kouwai were solid and they had not succeeded in several days. They gathered their troops and left the border city from the Da Mao Shan Pass, intending to harass the rear of the Japanese army in the Xingcheng and Suizhong areas. The 8th Brigade was ordered to harass the vicinity of Kouwai that night, while the rest of the troops rested in the Tianjiagang, Zhuxiongyu, and Cuiyuyu areas to prepare for a major offensive the next day. On the 2nd, Commander Wang of the Independent 8th Brigade decided to launch a major offensive on Kouwai that night, dividing his troops into three routes. One route departed from Xiangshui at 4 p.m., detouring through deep forests and cliffs, crossing the border city, and traveling 60 miles to counterattack the Xintaiyu stronghold in the enemy's left rear. Another route detoured around Yushan to attack the enemy's artillery positions at the Donglaoye Temple on the left side of Kouwai. The remaining route detoured around Xinzhuang to attack the artillery positions on the right side, and planted explosives to blow up the west gate. Each route was required to reach its destination before 10 p.m., first seizing Xintaiyu as a signal by setting it on fire, then blowing up the west gate and charging in. Fires broke out in the city, bullets rained down, and the sounds of battle shook the sky. Flesh and blood flew everywhere, and over a hundred enemies were killed. Many weapons were captured. The enemy resisted stubbornly, but our army fought even more bravely. Finally, the enemy's artillery fired wildly, and our army calmly responded. The two sides were locked in a stalemate until dawn when enemy reinforcements arrived and attempted to counterattack. Our army was unable to hold its ground and retreated in separate routes. That night, the battle was intense. Half of the returning soldiers were injured, their socks and shoes were worn out, their clothes were soaked in blood, and they were hungry, thirsty, and exhausted. It was truly something that only patriotic youths with the greatest spirit of sacrifice could endure. On the 3rd and 4th, our army temporarily retired because the soldiers had been fighting fiercely for days, were excessively exhausted, and lacked food, ammunition, and clothing. They awaited supplies from the rear before planning another attack. On the 5th, our army learned that the Japanese army had launched attacks against the volunteer armies in the Chaoyang, Beipiao, Suizhong, and Xingcheng areas, so they had transferred the Japanese army from Yu Pass and Kouwai the night before to provide reinforcements. The remaining Japanese army and puppet police at Kouwai totaled less than a hundred people. Our army had just been reinforced with a new force, and morale was high. Commander Wang urgently summoned the captains of each team to discuss the final attack on Kouwai. At 7:30 p.m. that evening, the commander ordered each team to lead their troops to depart without firing a shot. First, a team climbed the city in the dark, and then a team waited outside the east and west gates, waiting for the fire on the city to serve as a signal to attack. A team climbed the mountain to seize the enemy's artillery positions. After our army entered the city, they engaged the enemy in close combat, killing over 30 enemies and capturing over 10 guns. The enemy was terrified and fled out of the gate, retreating into the mountains. The next day at noon, the enemy sent armored vehicles to lead a large group of cavalry and infantry to reinforce. Our army retreated outside the city and fought them head-on. Both sides suffered casualties. After a while, our army retreated to its original defense. (7th)</p>
<h3>Progress of the Southwest National Defense Council</h3>
<p>Inviting Qian and Dian Provinces to Join, Cai and Bai to Hong Kong to Meet Li, Hu, and Huang Shaohong Returning to Guangzhou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since the establishment of the Southwest National Defense Council, it is now heard that it is planned to further expand, taking the three provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Fujian as the base and soliciting the participation of Qian and Dian provinces. If the two provinces participate, the number of council members will also increase, approximately one or two military and political leaders from each province as members of the National Defense Council. When necessary, the National Defense Council will set up special committees or specialized committees. At present, the General Affairs and Staff departments will be set up first. The office has been selected at the old site of the former Military Affairs Committee, and an office director has been appointed to handle the daily affairs of the National Defense Council. On the morning of the 3rd, the council held its first meeting, attended by Li Zongren, Chen Jitang, Bai Chongxi, Lin Yunhai, etc., to discuss various cases. Military plans cannot be disclosed. Regarding the national defense fortresses on the South Road of Guangdong Province, it was decided that the headquarters of the First Army Group would be responsible for preparing the matter and send personnel to inspect the South Road area. The National Defense Council plans to form a national defense construction inspection team in the short term, collecting specialized talents in the fields of sea, land, and air, as well as surveyors and construction technicians to become members of the team for design and construction after inspection. The organization law and inspection regulations of the inspection team have been drafted and will be carried out once approved at the meeting. Council members Cai Tingkai and Bai Chongxi went to Hong Kong on the 3rd to meet with Li Jishen and Hu Hanmin, and returned to Guangzhou on the 5th. They visited Xiang Shuiping and Li Zongren, and in the afternoon, they went to Dongshan Model Village to meet Chen Jitang, and held a temporary meeting at Chen's residence. It was heard that they were discussing the issue of suppressing the Communists externally, increasing the number of members of the National Defense Council, distributing important personnel, designing national defense construction, and drafting the regulations and rules of the National Defense Council. According to Cai Tingkai, Hu Hanmin's position on the current situation is as before, but it was not mentioned whether he would come to Guangdong. The Southwest National Defense Council is related to external defense, and the Dian and Qian provinces are also expected to participate. Council member Jiang Guangnai was unable to come to Guangdong due to the affairs of Fujian and will send a representative to attend in the future. After the meeting at Chen's residence, Cai returned to Hong Kong that afternoon to board a ship back to Fujian. Bai Chongxi is still in Guangdong, assisting in the affairs of the National Defense Council. Huang Shaohong left Guangdong for Hong Kong a few days ago. Yesterday, he received a telegram from the central government with instructions, so he took the Guangzhou-Kowloon Express to Guangdong on the afternoon of the 6th and immediately consulted with the authorities on various important matters, so the date of his return to Nanjing has been postponed. (February 7th)</p>
<h3>Chen Wenlin Arrives in Beijing from Fujian</h3>
<p>Beijing News: Fujian aviator Chen Wenlin was summoned to Beijing by Naval Minister Chen Shaokuan some days ago to discuss the establishment of naval aviation in Xiamen. After completing his official duties, he will return to Xiamen. According to Chen, naval aviation, protecting warships, is essential in wartime, as important as army aviation, but few Chinese people pay attention to it. The outside world does not understand the current situation of the Chinese navy, such as the shortage of funds, which makes it impossible to expand. It is limited by economic ability. Now, the Japanese bandits rely on their strong naval and land forces, disregard international law and justice, and invade us more and more urgently. The government and the people should understand each other, work together with one heart and one mind, and jointly defend the sea and land. Although the Japanese are strong and violent, we can still stand by in strict array.</p>
<h3>Songjiang</h3>
<p>The Prison Association Retains Warden Hu</p>

After the news spread, all believed that Warden Hu had eliminated malpractices and benefited the prisoners since taking office, which was by no means insignificant. Therefore, yesterday, they jointly telegraphed the Jiangsu High Court to retain him.</p>
<p>Liquidation After the Collapse of Yonghengmao</p>
<p>Last year, the city's commerce was in decline, and losses were common. Yonghengmao Clothing Store, which had been open for many years, and whose owner, Zhou Yongqing, was quite good at management, was affected by the collapse of the cotton mill, which caused Yonghengmao to become financially strained, losing more than 22,100 yuan, and declared liquidation. On the 10th, a meeting of creditors was convened, chaired by Hu Shiying, the representative of Xieshi Weicheng New Cloth Store. All debts were registered, totaling more than 60 large and small households, with Weicheng New having the largest amount. An inventory revealed that existing goods and assets were worth more than 2,000 yuan. The eventual reimbursement rate will be less than one percent.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>Chairman Ma Liang delivered the opening remarks, saying: "Fellow comrades, fellow compatriots, fellow Muslims, today, Muslims and people from all walks of life in Shanghai are holding a memorial service for Battalion Commander An Dexin and all the martyrs who died in his battalion. Recalling the Battle of Yuguan, Battalion Commander An commanded the officers and soldiers of the entire battalion, using one infantry battalion to resist two brigades of a strong enemy, along with heavy artillery and air force, displaying loyalty and righteousness with a determination to die without surrender. His heroic spirit can be compared to that of General Cai and other generals and soldiers in the Battle of Shanghai, and his name will be famous throughout the world. This provides a considerable model for later compatriots who save the country. At this time of severe national crisis, at this memorial meeting, we feel even more that our Chinese nation has a special patriotic spirit, a spirit of self-improvement and self-determination to strive for freedom and equality, and a determination to save the country. Before us, there was the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, and after them, there was Battalion Commander An and all the officers and soldiers of his battalion who sacrificed themselves for the love of their country. We should be confident that we have such courage to recover lost territory, protect our land, and promote national glory, which is very easy to do. According to the detailed descriptions of the situation in Yuguan at the time of the battle by people who fled from Yuguan to Shandong to take refuge, when the war began, Battalion Commander An warned his subordinates, saying, 'Since we are soldiers,</p>
<p>we are people who have pledged ourselves to the country. The future of us soldiers lies in seeking greatness on the path of death. For us soldiers to hope to return alive from the battlefield does not count as being a soldier. To want to leave a whole corpse on the battlefield does not count as being a soldier. Only when we soldiers are not afraid to sacrifice our lives can we be called as having pledged ourselves to the country and fulfilling our duties as soldiers, and only then will we not fail the people's blood and sweat of salaries and the country's entrustment. This time, we are defending Yuguan County. The enemy vainly hopes to occupy the county seat. Unless we all die in battle and they walk in over our corpses, otherwise, even if there is only one officer and one soldier left, we cannot let them enter.' From all these things, we can see that Battalion Commander An's bravery and sacrifice, his loyalty to defending the land and serving the country, are truly admirable. According to the refugees, the enemy at Yuguan outnumbered us several times. After several days of continuous fighting, due to the disparity in numbers, the enemy's planes bombed and broke the city walls, and the artillery destroyed the city gates, causing the enemy to rush into the city and start street fighting. Battalion Commander An ordered the officers and soldiers to use martial arts skills, with knives and guns, to fight the enemy in a melee. Surrounded on all sides, without food or drink, the entire battalion died in battle. At that time, the Muslims of Yuguan, knowing that Battalion Commander An had died in battle, risked their lives to rush into the line of fire and snatched Battalion Commander An's body from the battlefield. Observing Battalion Commander An's battle in Yuguan, the officers and soldiers of the entire battalion died at the same time. After the battle, the Muslims of Yuguan snatched his body. From this, we can see their good character of serving the country and loving the people. Recalling after the great earthquake in Japan, our entire country, from top to bottom, competed to provide relief, sparing no effort. Unexpectedly, when our country was in the midst of a great disaster, Japan forgot the friendship of being of the same culture and dependent on each other, and not only did not carry out disaster relief and neighborhood care, but instead took advantage of our crisis to forcibly occupy the Northeast, invade Shanghai, and break through Yuguan. Looking at their aggressive situation, it seems that there is no reason and no end in sight. In the future, not only China and Japan will suffer from cruel war, but if Japan does not quickly realize it, it will inevitably cause a world war, making all mankind suffer from the pain of killing. The danger is indescribable. Otherwise, if Japan truly disregards world humanitarianism and justice and invades China, we Chinese will all have the determination to risk our lives to save the country. How can we be successors to Korea and Taiwan? As last year, on January 28th, the Japanese army wanted to occupy Shanghai and disturb the Yangtze River. Because of the brave resistance of General Cai Tingkai and the generals, officers, and soldiers of the 19th Route Army and the 5th Army, they fought one against a hundred, fighting for more than a month. During this month of fighting, our army's generals and soldiers all risked their lives and were determined to kill the enemy. The Japanese army was almost unable to attack and was completely annihilated. Although the Japanese army's weapons were sharp, we were able to destroy strongholds and win every battle. It was all due to our army's well-trained and patriotic blood. The so-called complete victory over the enemy with a spirit of death. Today, the tragic death of Battalion Commander An in Yuguan, is it not also due to being well-trained, motivated by righteous indignation, and patriotic blood? Battalion Commander An's death is indeed a pity for the country's talent, but his death was the result of long-term training. Moreover, the Muslim people, because of their firm belief in religion, all regard fighting the enemy as an honor and regard death as returning home. As before, there was the Sino-Japanese War, when General Zuo fought against the Japanese army in Pyongyang and died in battle. It was also a defeat due to being outnumbered. The entire situation was broken. Today, Battalion Commander An is comparable to those before and after, with a consistent spirit. I have been devoted to martial arts education for more than forty years. All my students and subordinates are all over the country. I do not know how many people can have the noble character, strong martial arts skills, sacrifice for patriotism, and fearlessness of the enemy like Battalion Commander An. In this autumn of serious national crisis, our comrades and compatriots across the country already have General Cai in the Battle of Shanghai and the generals, officers, and soldiers of the 5th Army, and Battalion Commander An, the officers and soldiers in the Battle of Yuguan, who have set an example for us in resisting the enemy. Comrades and compatriots across the country must have the determination to die and vow to resist the strong enemy to the end, recognize the principle of being born out of desperation, continue the advance of the generals, officers, and soldiers in the Battles of Shanghai and Yuguan, restore the integrity of our country's territory, and protect the Three Principles of the People of our founding. There is an infinite amount of hope."</p>
<h3>Brief Report</h3>
<p>Wang Huishan reported the brief deeds of the martyred soldiers. Battalion Commander An was a prominent Muslim family in Baoding. After graduating from middle school, he was admitted to the Shandong Martial Arts Training Institute to study. After graduation, General Ma Zizhen assigned him to serve as the Quartermaster of the 5th Company of the 2nd Battalion of the 3rd Brigade of the Former War Participation Army, and then promoted to Platoon and Company Commander. At that time, although Battalion Commander An's rank was small, he was extremely loyal, diligent, and had an indomitable spirit. Since 1920, when the War Participation Army was reorganized, he entered the Northeast Jiangwutang to study. After graduation, he served as Deputy Battalion Commander and was ordered to guard Yuguan. People all know Battalion Commander An's oath that Yuguan exists with him and perishes with him, but they do not know that if the person does not perish, the pass will never be lost. Therefore, the person first died in battle, and the pass began to fall. Otherwise, if An were healthy, I know that Yuguan would still be ours and would not have been lost. The Muslim generals who are worthy of being recorded are Zuo Baogui in the Sino-Japanese War and Ma Fulu in the Boxer Rebellion. Today, Mr. An is worthy of being one of the three, which can also prove our Muslim's vow to protect the country to the death, and will never change. It is not like the Manchus who flattered Japan, the Tibetans who attached to England, and Outer Mongolia who belonged to Russia, etc.</p>

<h3>Wu Tiecheng's Speech</h3>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng said in his speech, "The situation of Battalion Commander An and others who died in Yuguan has been published in various newspapers. Now, after listening to General Ma's report, it seems that there is no need to repeat it. The death of Battalion Commander An and his soldiers, their great spirit, is truly admirable. The country is in a crisis that has never been seen in history. If we want to save the country from danger, we must all have the great sacrifice of Battalion Commander An and his soldiers. Looking at history, whenever the country is in a time of crisis, there will be loyal and brave people who stand up to relieve the difficulties. Now the national crisis is imminent. If we do not sacrifice for the country, I am afraid that we will not be able to sacrifice in the future. Therefore, today we commemorate Martyr An and others, we should strive to follow in the footsteps of Battalion Commander An, in order to save the country's declining fate and fulfill the duty of citizens."</p>
<h3>Zhang Zhijiang's Speech</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhijiang, the Director of the Central National Martial Arts Academy, said in his speech, "Battalion Commander An has died for the country. Today, we are holding a meeting here to commemorate him. Is it just out of a sense of admiration? Or, in addition to admiration, do we have a sense of responsibility for those who die later? When the country is in trouble, we can only save it by risking our lives. Battalion Commander An died for the country, and we should also die for the country. However, we should study the way to die. If we die for self-defense, then death is truly worthwhile. Premier Sun Yat-sen said that we can only survive if we have the ability to defend ourselves. Therefore, regardless of men, women, old, or young, we should all strive to defend ourselves in order to survive. Dying in the war against Japan is heavier than Mount Tai. The national crisis will be resolved, and the national shame will be washed away, not in the League of Nations but in our own self-defense. If we do not try to defend ourselves and hear that the situation in the League of Nations is getting better, we will be complacent. This kind of dependent heart will eventually lead to self-destruction."</p>
<h3>Wang Xiaolai's Speech</h3>
<p>Wang Xiaolai said in his speech, "Everyone, today last year, our 19th Route Army and the 5th Army were under the bombs and artillery fire of the enemy in Shanghai, resisting for our country's survival. Today, Battalion Commander An continues the anti-Japanese army in Shanghai and sacrifices himself for the country. It is not only the glory of the Muslim community, but also the glory of the Republic of China. Compared with the current Manchus who are puppets of the Japanese, it can be said that one is to be infamous for ten thousand years, and the other is to be famous for hundreds of generations. Now that Battalion Commander An has sacrificed himself for the country, the memorial service is temporary. We must continue the immortal spirit of Battalion Commander An and his subordinates who died in battle: 1. Promote domestic goods, revitalize industry, and recover rights. 2. The importance of national defense should be awakened in all walks of life, raising funds to purchase aircraft and train the air force."</p>
<h3>Discussion of Proposals</h3>
<p>During the meeting, Wang Zengshan and Ma Tianying respectively proposed proposals. The chairman summarized six articles and passed them one by one as follows: 1. Please the conference to posthumously award Martyr An the title of Ghazi (a term in Arabic meaning a brave and loyal soul) in accordance with the teachings. Resolved and passed. 2. Mr. Ma Zizhen reported the situation (photo by China East News Agency).</p>
<p>In the name of the conference, submit a request to the Central Government to posthumously award Martyr An the rank of Lieutenant General and Company Commanders Wang and Lan the rank of Colonel. Resolved and passed. 3. Submit a request to the Central Government to provide preferential treatment in accordance with the above-mentioned ranks of generals and colonels. Resolved and passed. 4. Advise the Muslim community to donate money to purchase airplanes and name them An Dexin. Resolved and passed in principle. Ma Liang also plans to use the One Yuan to Save the Country donation as a method of implementation and form another committee to handle it. 5. Organize a Muslim Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army and ask General Ma Zizhen to lead it. Resolved in principle by public vote. 6. Submit a request to the Shanghai Municipal Government to rename Fangbang Road in the city to Andexin Road as a permanent memorial. Resolved and passed by public vote.</p>
<h3>All Zhejiang Association Advocated That the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement Should Expire Upon Completion</h3>
<p>No need to announce cancellation, no need for amendments.</p>
<p>Moreover, it is not possible to renew an agreement based on equality and reciprocity.</p>
<p>The Shanghai All Zhejiang Association sent a telegram to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: "To the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Finance: According to reports, the Central Government has ordered the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance to jointly study the unequal points of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement and submit them to the Japanese side for amendment. After investigation, the unequal points of the Sino-Japanese Tariff Agreement are in the exchange of notes and attachments, not in the main text of the agreement. Various commercial organizations have requested cancellation, which is the reciprocal clause in the agreement's attachments. According to the attached table, the quantity of light-taxed goods occupied by our side is less than one percent of that of Japan. It is called reciprocity, but in reality, Japan controls its benefits and we suffer its harm. At that time, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Finance wanted to seek tariff autonomy and did not hesitate to sacrifice huge benefits in exchange. It was originally a last resort. Fortunately, the effective period is limited to three years. Now that the term has expired, it will naturally lose its effect. There is no need to announce the cancellation, and there is no reason to amend it. Generally speaking, tariff reciprocity agreements are common among friendly countries in Europe and the United States. However, under the state of Japanese military aggression, on the one hand, we ask the League of Nations to impose sanctions on it, and on the other hand, we ourselves re-sign a tariff reciprocity agreement with it, expressing a friendly attitude. This kind of contradictory policy will not only make the world laugh, but also confuse international psychology. Therefore, unequal treaties should be rejected by the country, and even equal reciprocity,</p>
<p>should not be renewed. I implore you to quickly determine the policy and not make a big mistake. The country is fortunate, the All Zhejiang Association kowtows."</p>

<h3>Rong Zongjing Discusses the Reasons for Purchasing American and Australian Wheat</h3>
<p>Said it was a last resort</p>
<p>A reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency interviewed Rong Zongjing, a leader in the flour industry, yesterday about the arrival of American wheat in China. According to him, the arrival of South American Argentine wheat in China this time is due to the dumping of Australian wheat in China, which has greatly affected American wheat. Therefore, they do not hesitate to depreciate the price for sale and compete. According to reports, the amount purchased by Shanghai is 22,000 tons, but in reality, it is 30,000 tons. The motivation for purchasing foreign wheat is entirely because China's wheat production last year was too small, less than three-tenths of the previous years. It is really not enough to meet the needs. If we do not purchase foreign wheat, all the flour mills in the city will have no work to do. Now, the 30,000 tons of wheat are expected to arrive in Shanghai around May. However, after arriving in China, according to the sales in the local market, it can only cope with three months at most. The price is 3 taels and 3 mace and a half. As for the advantages of American wheat, 1. it is dry and durable, 2. it has sufficient fermentation. Therefore, this situation is not entirely due to merchants being greedy for small profits, but out of necessity. The poor quality of Chinese products is also undeniable. Therefore, I have repeatedly suggested to Minister Song Ziwen to try to reform it as much as possible so that the products are of excellent quality and the production is increased. If this continues, it will only become more miserable. Just in terms of North China this year, the wheat flour used is all Japanese goods. If the situation in Tianjin and Hebei suddenly changes and we no longer purchase foreign wheat for emergency relief, there will be problems with the food supply in North China. Therefore, the reason for purchasing American and Australian wheat this time is also here. As for the reason for stopping the American wheat loan, it is because the American farmers are also not well-off. Therefore, although the American government is willing to lend to our country, it must be purchased with cash for this reason. Our country does not have this financial capacity, so we have to stop, etc.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Journalists' Association Petitions the Central Government to Remove Gu Zhutong from Office</h3>
<p>Violating the Provisional Constitution and Undermining the Five-Power Constitution</p>
<p>Deliberately Distorting Texts, Committing Countless Crimes</p>
<p>Demanding Strict Punishment to Genuinely Protect Human Rights</p>
<p>Following Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Gu Zhutong's illegal execution of Liu Yusheng, manager and editor of the Zhenjiang Jiangsheng Daily, and the closure of the newspaper, various provincial and municipal organizations have risen in opposition. The Shanghai Journalists' Association has formed a special committee for the Liu case, dispatching members to Zhenjiang on the second of this month to investigate the facts and collect the manuscripts from the "Iron Plough" supplement of the Jiangsheng Daily, which the Jiangsu Provincial Government deemed to be communist propaganda. After returning to Shanghai on the fourth, the Liu case special committee immediately began drafting a petition and declaration, which were passed by the executive committee on the eighth. The petition was sent to Nanjing by express mail the night before last, requesting the Central Party Headquarters and the National Government to remove Gu Zhutong from office and severely punish him, and for the Control Yuan to continue its impeachment. The petition and the two articles "Voices from the Border" and "The Era is Not the Era" are reproduced below.</p>
<p>Petition to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Control Yuan, stating that Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Gu Zhutong illegally executed Liu Yusheng, manager and editor of the Zhenjiang Jiangsheng Daily, requesting his removal from office and investigation (continued impeachment) and strict punishment according to law. It is reported that Gu Zhutong violated the provisions of the Publication Law, encroached upon the powers of the Ministry of the Interior, closed the Zhenjiang Jiangsheng Daily, and arrested Liu Yusheng, the newspaper's manager and editor, on July 26th. He also violated Article 8 of the Provisional Constitution of the Republic of China during the period of political tutelage by not transferring him to a judicial organ within 24 hours of his arrest, delaying for three days before taking him to the Jiangsu Provincial Capital Garrison Headquarters for interrogation on July 30th. After six months of detention, and while the Control Yuan (your esteemed Yuan) was conducting a thorough investigation following its impeachment, he escalated the situation and ordered his execution, undermining the rule of law and trampling on human rights, which has caused deep indignation among all citizens. Furthermore, upon examining the texts cited by Gu Zhutong in his document to the Executive Yuan, taken from the "Iron Plough" supplement of the Jiangsheng Daily, they have been deliberately distorted and countless errors made. For example, the cited passage, "Our country's soldiers retreat to the left, and naturally the enemy comes up on the right, the ground rising in a red tide," is actually from the "Voices from the Border" article and entirely describes the valiant resistance of border guards against the enemy. The original section reads: "A team of our... country's soldiers retreats to the left, and naturally the enemy comes up on the right. Japanese soldiers are in pursuit, the national flag with a white sun on a blue sky over a red ground is tilted on the earthwork, and a large flag with a white day and red sun is raised upright." Another section reads: "Amid the rumbling of gunfire and cannons, the soldiers on the earthwork gradually dwindle to a few, and finally, they all fall around the national flag, collapsing in a pool of blood. The national flag, snatched back from the pool of blood, still accompanies them as they fall on a field of red tide and snowy ground..." The meaning is clear, yet patriotic words are labeled as inciting red terror, causing a sense of injustice. As for the remaining five articles, "When," "The Next Sentence Must Know," "Our Hope," "The Era is Not the Era," and "Dragon Boat Festival," they either depict rural hardship, narrate the lives of laborers, are seasonal travelogues, or are editor's prefaces, precisely the kind of works that the Control Yuan (your esteemed Yuan) has described as merely depicting the state of our country's social life, with absolutely no reactionary content. Moreover, the Jiangsu Provincial Party Headquarters also resolved at a meeting on July 28th to instruct the Jiangsu Provincial Government to allow the Jiangsheng Daily to resume publication and to release Liu Yusheng on bail. This provides strong evidence that Liu Yusheng had no reactionary behavior and that the Jiangsheng Daily had no reactionary content. Yet Gu Zhutong, under the rule of the Party, disregarded the resolution of the highest provincial Party Headquarters; under the five-power constitutional system, disregarded the impeachment of the highest supervisory organ of the country; acted arbitrarily, denying Liu Yusheng any opportunity for reflection and repentance, and insisting on putting him to death. Such trampling on human rights and disregard for human life was rare even in the warlord era, yet Gu Zhutong dared to brazenly do it. His destruction of the law and violation of discipline is evident. Protecting human rights was specifically stated in a clear order by your government (the National Government) on April 22nd, 1929, and the promotion of the news industry was resolved by the National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party. If Gu Zhutong's actions are not severely punished, how can the observance of the Provisional Constitution be demonstrated and the people be given a guarantee of survival? Therefore, we have specially checked various attachments and respectfully submit this document to your departments (your government) (your esteemed Yuan) for review and verification, requesting the removal of Jiangsu Provincial Government Chairman Gu Zhutong from office and punishment according to law (continued impeachment, requesting the National Government to immediately remove him from office) in order to uphold the law and value human rights. We dare not delay in awaiting your urgent command. Respectfully submitted to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, and the Control Yuan, with six articles from the "Iron Plough" supplement and a letter of repentance from Liu Yusheng to the Provincial Government from prison attached. Shanghai Journalists' Association.</p>
<p>(Voices from the Border) (Copied from the "Iron Plough" supplement of the Jiangsheng Daily) (Chang Pu) There is no sun in the sky, and a gloomy curtain of haze hangs low over the sky. The snow has stopped falling. Several sparse, bare trees stand under the gray sky, wearing pure white clothes. The rough north wind howls, running around their fingers, arms, and ears, shaking them back and forth, occasionally knocking the powder off their faces. The snow on the ground is knee-deep. The wind blowing on the face feels like peeling skin. The snow is frozen deep. The flat sands beyond the Great Wall have become a silver sea. The earthworks stand tall like rolled-up waves. There are no travelers, no flying birds, no walking beasts. The wind beyond the Great Wall is as cold and sharp as a knife. The surroundings are as quiet as the dead of night. Suddenly, there is a change in front of the distant earthworks. Puffs of smoke, bursts of fire. Although far away, they are distinct under the reflection of the snow. "Pa pa pa..." "Boom boom boom..." The sound of gunfire and cannons grows louder and louder, sweeping away the wilderness's silence. "A team of our country's soldiers retreats to the left, and naturally the enemy comes up on the right." Japanese soldiers are in pursuit. The national flag with a white sun on a blue sky over a red ground is tilted on the earthwork, and a large flag with a white day and red sun is raised upright. As the retreating men on the left slowly dwindle, reinforcements come up on the left, and the sound of gunfire and cannons grows louder, fiercer, and denser. They turn back, the wind blowing on their faces feels like peeling skin, the snow is knee-deep, and the deep parts are frozen. People charge forward in the cold wind and ice and snow. "Di da da di da da da..." The bugle of the charge wails. Boom! A sound, a burst of sparks. Several people fall, heads exploding, bellies splitting, arms breaking, legs shattering, a field of red tide rising on the ground. Pa! A sound, a person falls, a black shadow lying across the snow, adding a patch of red. "Di da da di da da..." The bugle of the charge wails, the wind blowing on their faces feels like peeling skin, the snow is knee-deep, and the deep parts are frozen. People charge forward in the cold wind and ice and snow. The enemy slowly dwindles and retreats, and our soldiers gradually dwindle and advance. They do not know the terror of death, nor do they feel the cold. They only know to win glory for the nation, to snatch back the flag of the motherland from the pool of blood, and to snatch back the earthwork of the motherland from the corpses of their own brothers. They see their older brothers and younger brothers killed on the earthwork, and they want to find their older brothers and younger brothers to go and see their parents underground. Their parents will welcome them back in this way with joy. Their faces are full of smiles, not knowing the terror of death, nor knowing the cold of the icy and snowy border. Finally, the flag with a white sun on a blue sky over a red ground is raised upright on the earthwork, and the large flag with a white day and red sun falls. The earthwork is snatched back. Those seeking their older brothers and younger brothers to go and see their parents return with laughter. Half an hour later, the enemy's rear flank approaches before their own rear flank arrives. There are only a few, twenty or thirty, soldiers of the motherland defending, defending to the death. Amid the rumbling of gunfire and cannons, the soldiers on the earthwork gradually dwindle to a few, and finally, they all collapse around the national flag, collapsing in a pool of blood. "The national flag, snatched back from the pool of blood, still accompanies them as they fall on a field of red tide and snowy ground." The surroundings slowly return to silence. The wind wails in the woods, and a mass of large snow falls again in the gloomy sky. "The Era is Not the Era" "JiangSheng Daily Iron Plough Supplement" "Juzi" "The Era is Not the Era." Grandmother often sighed like this. "420 for Xian rice, 380 for rough rice." When her son came back and talked to his wife about how expensive rice prices have become recently, implying that a few wages are not enough to buy rice to eat, the grandmother was shocked. She asked, "Are the people rioting? Will the county magistrate lose his head?" She recalled when rice prices reached thirty-odd coins per liter, the county magistrate was so anxious to find ways to stabilize prices. If it got any more expensive, the county magistrate would not only be dismissed but also investigated, and if things went wrong, his life would not be guaranteed. This was because the emperor was afraid that the people would suffer from famine. Her son told her that the streets were as quiet as usual, and the county magistrate was still the county magistrate. She was surprised, she was too..."The Era is Not the Era." Her little grandson, only three years old, snatched sesame cakes when he saw them. Her five-year-old grandson wouldn't let go, and the little grandson cried, "Hungry!" She felt that the era was really not the era, even children as young as that knew they were hungry and knew to snatch sesame cakes to eat. She sighed, she heard her son reading the newspaper that in Shanghai alone, five or six cases of robbery and kidnapping occurred every day. She had never heard of such cases occurring in cities in the early years. "The Era is Not the Era." June 15th, 3 a.m.</p>

The association has been established for over a year, and although we have not achieved much, we have followed our original intention and strived to seek welfare for the workers. In the past year, labor-management disputes have occurred frequently, and the association has spared no effort in guiding and mediating, which is somewhat gratifying. During the January 28th Incident in Shanghai, the association embraced the duty of every citizen and led the workers to perform tasks such as transportation and rescue for our loyal and brave soldiers, which was witnessed by the people of Shanghai. After the second session of the executive and supervisory committee members take office, they should accept the will of the workers and work diligently, strive for labor-management cooperation, develop industries, and jointly strive for the survival of the nation in order to save the current disaster."

<h3>The Support Association Provides Medicine to Ma Zhanshan's Troops</h3>
<p>The Northeast Volunteer Army Support Association received letters from Wu Huanzhang, Yin Zhongfan, and Jiang Songnian, representatives of Ma Zhanshan stationed in Shanghai, requesting the purchase of needed medical equipment and medicine. The association agreed to do so and sent a reply yesterday, saying, "In reply, we received your letter of February 6th, listing the needed military medical equipment and medicine, requesting the allocation of funds for purchase and delivery for emergency use. We approve this request. Recently, Yang, director of the medical department of Feng Zhanhai's troops, came to Shanghai from Zhitong to purchase medical supplies. After listing the items, Representative Pang Yue Dong sent a letter to our association requesting an introduction and allocation of funds for purchase. We have already purchased the items from Jicheng Pharmacy, totaling 2,072.13 yuan, which our association has paid, plus an additional 200 yuan for shipping costs. We approve the previous request and have resolved to purchase the same set of medical supplies as those purchased for Feng's troops and allocate the same amount for shipping costs. In addition to sending members of the association to inspect the goods, verify them, and pack them, we ask that you provide a receipt for the goods and funds for each, and come to the association to collect them for use by Deng Wen and Li Haiqing's troops stationed in Rehe who retreated from Heilongjiang. We are hereby replying to you, hoping that you will take note and handle it accordingly. Respectfully to Mr. Wu Huanzhang, Yin Zhongfan, and Jiang Songnian, representatives of General Ma Zhanshan.

<h3>Guizhou's Military Situation Comes to an End, Wang Jialie Cables Inviting He and Deng to Return to Guizhou</h3>
<p>Wang Jialie of Guizhou cabled to Shanghai yesterday, asking He Jiwu and Deng Mingjie, who are traveling in Shanghai, to return to Guizhou and serve their hometown. Yesterday, He and Deng replied to Commander Wang. The original texts of the two telegrams are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Jialie's Telegram: "To Mr. Deng Mingjie and Mr. He Jiwu, Since the turmoil in Guizhou, I have felt deeply ashamed and remorseful. I originally intended to resign and step down after returning to the province and the military situation ended, so as to fulfill my original intention. Now, I have been ordered by the central government to resume my duties and to prepare for the aftermath. I am unable to relinquish my responsibilities rashly and can only strive to be diligent and cautious. However, the aftermath of the situation in Guizhou is complicated and requires the joint efforts of many capable people. Your concern for your hometown has always been admired, and I sincerely hope that you will come to Guiyang to assist in managing it, so that the disaster in our hometown can be alleviated as soon as possible. Your help is deeply relied upon. I also hope to receive a reply. Wang Jialie respectfully."</p>
<p>He and Deng's Reply: "To Commander Wang Shaowu of Guiyang, We have received your telegram and are grateful for your kind intentions. We have been away for many years and are confident that we can establish ourselves anywhere. We have seen more of the outside world, and although we feel various inconveniences, we have become accustomed to them. Now that the military situation in our hometown has come to an end, all aftermath work should be started. Taking this opportunity for unification, it is appropriate to reduce the number of troops, make finances public, care for the people's livelihood, and concentrate on construction, so that politics can be brought back on track, and our fathers and brothers who are suffering can have some respite and gradually have a chance to survive. Although we are insignificant, our love for our hometown is no less than others. If those in power are beneficial to Guizhou, we are willing to do our best to assist from the outside at any time. If not, and they cultivate their power, harm the people, are untrustworthy to the outside world, and unjust internally, we cannot stand idly by and watch as if it were a fire on the other shore. This is our straightforward nature, not understanding changes in the times. We are grateful for your concern and are sending this message to you. He Jiwu and Deng Hanxiang, respectfully."</p>
<h3>British Troops Arrive in Shanghai Yesterday for Rotation</h3>
<p>The 2nd Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, the 2nd Battalion of the East Lancashire Regiment of the British Army arrived in Shanghai yesterday (11th) on the transport ship Neuralia. This morning (12th) at 9:30 a.m., they landed at the Huangpu Wharf, passed through Yangshupu Road, Broadway Road, the Bund, and Nanjing Road, and arrived at the racecourse for a half-hour rest. They met with the soldiers of the 1st Battalion. It is reported that since the regiment was reorganized and established, it has been stationed in various places, and the 1st and 2nd Battalions have never met before. This is the first time they have seen each other, so both sides greeted each other according to military salutes. They then proceeded along Jing'an Temple Road to their residence on Jiaozhou Road. Eighty men from the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders, who arrived with them, landed earlier yesterday afternoon and proceeded to the barracks on Great West Road. The 1st Battalion of the regiment, which was originally stationed in Shanghai, is being rotated with the 2nd Battalion and is currently stationed in the racecourse. They will board a transport ship on Friday and set sail from Shanghai early Saturday morning to be stationed in Crete. However, 350 soldiers and one officer from the battalion will remain in Shanghai and be merged into the 2nd Battalion.</p>
<h3>The Sugar Industry and Other Industries Begin Negotiations with the Southern Goods Industry Last Night</h3>
<p>All Goods Except Southern Goods on the Market Conduct Business as Usual</p>
<p>The Shanghai Sugar, Seafood, Northern and Southern Sundries Trade Union Market of Shanghai decided to implement new weights and measures, and the sugar and northern goods industries demanded the use of bank drafts for settlement, which led to opposition from the southern goods industry, which decided to suspend business on the market and buy goods from dealers. Last night, the sugar and southern goods industries began negotiations to resolve the issue. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Course of the Dispute: The Shanghai Sugar, Seafood, Northern and Southern Sundries Trade Union Market is organized by seven trade associations: the Sugar Industry Association, the Seafood Industry Association, the Southern Goods Industry Association, the Northern Goods Industry Association, the Northern and Southern Goods Exchange Association, the Longan Industry Association, and the Cooked Goods Industry Association. Regarding the issue of new weights and measures, the highest organ of the Union Market, the Executive-Evaluation Joint Conference, was convened on October 29th to discuss the procedures for adopting new weights and measures. Nine executive committee members and twelve evaluation committee members attended, but the Southern Goods Industry Association was absent. After a long discussion, it was resolved that the matter concerned a government order and should be followed. It was approved that the new weights and measures would be implemented on January 1st, 1933, and it was stipulated that from the date of adoption, those who sold at 90% of the original price would change to 88%, and those who sold at 87% would change to 85%, as the practical standard for the new system. The members of each association were notified and instructed to comply as scheduled. Currently, the sugar and northern goods industries require all settlements to be made by bank draft, refusing to accept checks, which has led to opposition from the southern goods industry.</p>
<p>Market Situation: After the Southern Goods Industry Association decided to suspend business on the market and privately buy goods from dealers before a resolution was reached, the United Market, except for the Southern Goods Industry, including the Sugar Industry, Northern Goods Industry, Northern and Southern Goods Exchange Industry, Cooked Goods Industry, Longan Industry, and Seafood Industry, all conducted business as usual yesterday. A notice was posted at the entrance of the market, stating, "Notice: The market is a place for members to conduct public trade. All those who enter must strictly abide by the order and regulations. We hereby reiterate this notice and urge everyone to pay attention and be self-respecting."</p>
<p>Negotiations Last Night: At 6 p.m. yesterday, the Southern Goods Industry and the Sugar Industry discussed solutions at the Hongyun Restaurant in order to resolve the issue as soon as possible. Zheng Zenan, Jiang Zhenbang, Xu Jingfu, Yang Wen, and Zhang Zuwang attended from the Sugar Industry Association. Jing Yan, Ni Fu, Cheng Dongping, Xu Kesun, and Shen Yiqiu attended from the Southern Goods Industry Association. After a long discussion, it is said that no decision has been made yet, and it is also said that the Southern Goods Industry will negotiate with the Northern Goods Industry.</p>
<p>Market Meeting: The Shanghai Sugar, Seafood, Northern and Southern Sundries Trade Union Market convened an Executive-Evaluation Joint Conference the day before yesterday (10th). Thirteen executive committee members and fifteen evaluation committee members attended, with Qiu Yangzhi as chairman. The following resolutions were made for each industry: 1. Executive Committee Member Zheng Zenan proposed that each executive and evaluation committee member of the market should be given an admission pass. Resolved: When issuing new admission passes this year, each member will be allowed to distribute one pass. 2. Letters from the Northern Goods Industry Association and the Seafood Industry Association requested action against the Southern Goods Industry's refusal to implement the new scale method in the market. Resolved: The standard for the new scale was publicly resolved by the Executive-Evaluation Joint Conference of this market on October 29th of last year and should be implemented accordingly to comply with the original plan. If there is any pretense of compliance, each industry association should be notified to investigate. If there is evidence, the admission pass should be revoked. 3. If the amount paid by [blank] Street is insufficient, how should it be handled? Resolved: If the amount paid for goods is not handled according to the new regulations, or there is a shortage, the silver paid should be received first, and the amount that is insufficient should be reported to the relevant industry association, and efforts should be made to actively pursue the matter. Before the full amount is paid, trade should be temporarily suspended to facilitate mutual assistance and achieve results. 4. The Sesame Oil Industry and Asphalt White [blank] Industry want to join this market as basic members. Resolved: It will be temporarily reserved. Committee Member Zheng Zenan will contact the Social Affairs Bureau and then make a resolution. 5. If committee members from each industry increase their business in other industries' goods, they should join the relevant industry association. Resolved: The original plan was passed and each industry association was notified to implement it. 6. Executive Committee Member Xu Jingfu proposed that inland guest gangs join this market as members. Resolved: New guests entering the association should be introduced by two members of the guest gang association and must have the seal of the store they are running to be allowed to join. Old guests and the Shanghai-Hong Kong Yangtze River gangs are not subject to this rule. 7.</p>
<p>How should the bankruptcy of a guest gang be handled? Resolved: If a guest fails, in addition to pursuing the debt from them, other guests will not be allowed to take over the store number they are running until the debt is fully paid off.</p>
<h3>Ningbo and Taiping Steamers Both Found Damaged Yesterday After Inspection</h3>
<p>Ship inspectors have separately reported to the companies</p>
<p>No further bodies of victims have been found</p>
<p>Following the collision between the Taikoo Company's Ningbo Steamer and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Taiping Steamer, the two companies dispatched ship inspectors yesterday to conduct a joint inspection. The losses incurred by the affected sand boats will be subject to negotiated settlements. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Inspection Results: Yesterday at 10:00 AM, the Taikoo Company sent Deputy Chief Engineer Pei Er, and the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent ship inspector En Ga Si, to conduct a joint inspection. They first went to the China Wharf to inspect the Taiping Steamer, and then to the Jiangnan Shipyard to inspect the Ningbo Steamer. The inspection results are as follows: 1) Damages to the Taiping Steamer: three steel plates on the bow, the anchor chain hole, the bow cabin, one piece of angle iron on the side of the ship, the steel waist of the lamp room, one supporting lamp, one red melon lamp, one hand-held lamp, one front and rear mast lamp, and one anchor lamp. 2) Damages to the Ningbo Steamer: one steel anchor at the anchor chain hole, and one anchor chain. Both ship inspectors have now reported the results of the ship inspection to their respective companies.</p>
<p>Unable to Salvage Bodies: Following the collision between the two steamers, various sand boats affected and damaged have already submitted claims for compensation. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has notified the Taikoo Company to negotiate a settlement. As for the sunken vessel and the drowning passengers, a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency inquired again at the South City Life-Saving Bureau yesterday. According to them, as of the evening of the 12th, apart from Zhang A Wu, who was rescued at the time, the rest could not be salvaged. It will be necessary to wait until one or two months later, when the weather is warmer, for the bodies to gradually float to the surface before salvage can be carried out.</p>

<h3>Kidnappers Active Again: Huang Baohua Abducted</h3>
<p>Met bandits at the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Ghisi</p>
<p>Bandits pointed a pistol at the head of the hired carriage driver</p>
<p>The driver was extremely frightened and unable to help his master</p>
<p>The hostage was put in a car and sped off westward</p>
<h3>Ghisi Road Mansion</h3>
<p>A kidnapping occurred at the intersection of Route Ghisi (now Songshan Road) and Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession at approximately 7:00 PM last night. Details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Huang Baohua, a native of Jiangyin, 50 years old, has been working as a bookkeeper at the Ruikang Paint Shop on Shandong Road in the International Settlement. He is known for his diligence and competence and is highly trusted by his boss. He resides in a mansion at No. 25 Route Ghisi, at the corner of Rue Wagner in the French Concession. He has a wife, a son, and a daughter. His son is twenty years old and has been sickly since childhood. His daughter is of marriageable age and is currently studying at a school.</p>
<h3>Kidnappers Suddenly Jumped Out</h3>
<p>Yesterday evening, Huang took his hired carriage to a spring banquet hosted by a friend. Around 7:00 PM, Huang finished the banquet and started heading home. The carriage driver, a man from Jiangbei named A Si, proceeded along the road. Before long, they reached the intersection of Avenue Edward VII and Route Ghisi. Just as they turned south and had not gone more than a few steps, near the Xu Zifeng dentist's office at No. 10, three or four kidnappers suddenly jumped out from the roadside, blocking their way.</p>
<h3>Dragged into the Car</h3>
<p>The bandits stepped forward, each wielding a pistol. They first surrounded the carriage. One bandit pinned the carriage driver, A Si, to the ground, pointing a gun at his head and warning him not to make a sound. The remaining bandits took the opportunity to drag Huang from the carriage and force him into a car parked nearby. At the same time, the bandit monitoring A Si, seeing that the hostage had been successfully taken, pushed A Si to the ground, ordering him to quickly take the carriage back home and report to Huang's family.</p>
<h3>Police Investigation</h3>
<p>A Si was stunned. He watched the bandits jump into the car, which sped off westward along Avenue Edward VII. He immediately took the carriage to Huang's residence to report to the police and Huang's family. The police chief immediately dispatched the officer on duty to investigate, and used the telephone to notify all police stations in the International Settlement and all district branches of the Public Safety Bureau in the Chinese area to be on the lookout.</p>
<h3>Family's Account</h3>
<p>When the reporter arrived, Huang's family was very secretive. At first, they firmly denied the incident, and then claimed that Huang had long since left Ruikang and that in recent years, he had incurred significant losses in some business ventures. Currently, to make a living, he only runs a foreign goods store in Wuxi to support his family. The reporter then asked when the carriage driver had been hired. They replied that the carriage driver, A Si, had been hired for many years. Initially, it was his brother, A San, who held the position, and later A Si. He is usually extremely loyal.</p>
<h3>Zheng Xitang's Condition Has Not Worsened</h3>
<p>Life can be saved if there are no changes in three days</p>
<p>Officer Zhang's left arm must be amputated, inevitably becoming disabled</p>
<p>Zheng Xitang, a leading figure in the shipping industry, was kidnapped by three armed bandits with pistols and Mauser pistols just after leaving the Ping An Shipping Company in Dongjiadu, South City, at around 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. The bandits shot and killed Zheng's bodyguard, a Russian named Sadive, and Zheng was also shot in the head. Stray bullets also wounded two police officers and a passerby who were trying to apprehend the bandits. As a result, the bandits all escaped. Zheng was taken to Shanghai Hospital and, after bandaging, transferred to Tongren Hospital for treatment. According to reports yesterday, the bullet that injured Zheng Xitang entered through the back of his head and exited above his left ear, only damaging a corner of the skull and not affecting the brain. Therefore, after entering Tongren Hospital and being examined and treated by Western doctors, he was quite conscious. His fever has not increased, and his condition has not changed. If there are no changes in the next three days, his life can hopefully be saved. Yesterday, prominent businessmen such as Yu Qiaqing and Fang Jiaobo went to the hospital to visit, and were received by Xu Wanli and Chen Yisheng. However, Lu Bohong, as a director of Tongren Hospital, was granted special permission by the doctors to speak a few words with Zheng, and his condition is quite good. The body of Zheng's bodyguard, the Russian Sadive, has been examined by the court. Because the Russian's mother and son are in Harbin, and only a nephew is currently in Shanghai, the funeral expenses provided by Zheng will be issued only after the Russian's close friend, who is now a police chief in the Hongkou police station of the International Settlement, provides proof and signs the receipt for the coffin and burial. Of the police officers Zhang Dianrong and Yang Zhanbiao who were injured on the scene during the pursuit of the kidnappers, Zhang was also transferred to Tongren Hospital yesterday after being examined by a Western doctor. According to reports, Officer Zhang's left arm must be amputated, and he will likely become disabled. Yang Police sustained minor injuries and remained at Shanghai Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3>Feng Zhongqing Speaks on Commercial Ethics</h3>
<p>Speech at the Silk Industry Bank yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday was the first board meeting of the Shanghai Silk Industry Commercial Savings Bank since the New Year. Feng Zhongqing, Deputy Manager of the Bank of China and Director of the Silk Industry Bank, gave a speech on the issue of merchant ethics in the bank's meeting room. The gist of his speech was that the establishment of the Shanghai market and the customs of various industries have been followed for a long time, but from my observations over the past year, I feel that there are two major shortcomings: the first is the lack of merchant ethics, and the second is the deep-rooted pursuit of personal enjoyment. We engage in the financial industry, with credit as our mainstay. Currently, merchants disregard ethics and often use the good name of ethics as a mask, so credit is almost completely destroyed. Today's merchants have become aristocratic, completely the opposite of the diligent, thrifty, conservative, and creditworthy commoners of the past. Leaders are also becoming increasingly extravagant, entirely based on personal enjoyment. In the banking industry, which is based on credit and ethics, this causes a great deal of pain. Therefore, in the current situation, we should emulate European merchants by implementing "law," "investigation," and "intelligence." By regulating various businesses entirely by law, so that they do not overstep their bounds, we can remedy the lack of commercial ethics and break down the false merchants who wear the mask of pseudo-ethics. Investigation is especially important. Detailed investigations of the operation, technology, methods, and credit of industries and businesses will allow the banking industry to solidify its foundation. Although this may not be achievable in the short term, it is the path we must take. I hope that my colleagues at the bank will pay attention to this. Finally, General Manager Wang Yansong of the bank elaborated on the necessity of merchant ethics and the bank's attention to cultivating the ethics of its employees to promote merchant ethics.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Bank Facilitates Communication Between Shareholders</h3>
<p>Giving Each Shareholder a Copy of the Haiguang Monthly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bank, for the purpose of increasing the knowledge and connecting the feelings of its employees, has specially published a monthly magazine called "Haiguang," which has been in existence for five years. Since the end of last year, it has been edited by Mr. Song Chunfang. Mr. Song previously served as a consultant to the Qingdao Municipal Government and has long been renowned in the art world. Last year, he was invited to Shanghai by General Manager Chen Guangfu of the bank to compile the bank's history. Mr. Song also used his spare time to preside over "Haiguang," greatly reforming its content and changing the format to the most lively and up-to-date. The publication widely compiles articles on the world economic situation, domestic financial conditions, the bank's business policies, as well as the way to refine virtue and cultivate career, and after-dinner conversations. All of these are designed to increase the knowledge and expand the horizons of the bank's employees and enrich their lives. In order to communicate between shareholders and the bank, General Manager Chen added "Haiguang" to each shareholder's name starting in March of this year. Thus the shareholders knew everything big and small that was going on in the bank. If the shareholders have an idea, it can also be published in this magazine. It is a very meaningful move. If domestic publications wish to exchange publications, they may do so. Letters can be sent to the Haiguang Editorial Department of the Shanghai Bank on Ningbo Road, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Private Electricity Association Holds Executive and Supervisory Committee Meeting</h3>
<p>The fourth session of the third Executive and Supervisory Committee of the Zhejiang Private Electricity Association was held at 25 Central Road yesterday. More than ten representatives from companies in Shaoxing, Wuxing, Jiaxing, Lanxi, Wenzhou, Pinghu, Xiashi, Jiashan, and other places attended. Li Yanshi chaired the meeting. Formal greetings were given and the following items were reported: 1) Report on the investigation by the first Zhejiang East Investigation Group; 2) The association previously presented a request to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, Construction Department, and Finance Department to strictly prohibit the arbitrary reduction or default of electricity payments by local agencies and organizations. The Construction and Finance Departments have successively issued instructions and the Provincial Government has circulated them to all local agencies and organizations and their personnel throughout the province, requiring them to follow the regulations of each company when using electricity in the future, and to pay off all previous arrears in order to protect private electricity enterprises. The following items were discussed: 1) Investigate the fifth and sixth articles of the Electrical Franchise Agreement signed by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Qixin Syndicate, which infringe upon the rights of members in Shaoxing, Wuxing, Jiaxing, Changxing and other places. At the same time, according to reports, the Construction Department is urging the syndicate to implement the planned power transmission line and force members to sell electricity according to the company's plan, which would damage the rights of the members. How should the association respond to this and submit to the Department for payment? It was resolved that the association will submit a separate report to the competent authorities to argue the case regarding the infringement of the rights of members in the agreement. 2) It was resolved that the draft articles of association of the consumer cooperative will be revised by the investors after negotiation. 3) The Hangzhou Electric Power Co., Ltd. sent a letter requesting membership, which was submitted for public decision. It was resolved that it would be temporarily reserved until the fifth and sixth articles of the agreement signed by the Zhejiang Provincial Government and the Qixin Syndicate were clearly resolved. 4) The proposal to organize the second Zhejiang East Investigation Group was approved. 5) Since the outbreak of the artificial petroleum oil boom, various members have repeatedly reported that they have been arbitrarily hampered in the delivery of diesel contracts signed with Asia Petroleum and Mobil, causing them great hardship. It is proposed that the association find ways to provide relief. It was resolved that during the period when the Meiya Oil Co. is suppressing member companies, each member company may as well sign a new contract with Texaco to provide relief. 6) Omitted.</p>
<h3>New Measuring Instruments for Rice Exports to be Separately Determined</h3>
<p>Changed to a system of one stone, one dou, and eight sheng</p>
<p>The Social Affairs Bureau has approved the manufacturing</p>
<p>Since the rice industry colleagues in this city changed to the new measuring instrument of eight dou and five sheng, all colleagues in the market trade are in accordance with this regulation. However, the rice shops that are engaged in export, find that the sales of loading and exporting after changing to the new instrument suffer great secret losses, and all expenses and losses are even greater, and the procedures are very complicated. They have successively requested the Bean and Rice Industry Association to change the rice husk used for loading and exporting to one stone, one dou and eight sheng, and the sales of this street still use the new measuring instrument of eight five for trading. The Bean and Rice Industry Association once convened a joint meeting of various rice industry organizations in Shanghai, and it was resolved that the rice husk for export should be changed to one stone, one dou and eight sheng, and submitted to the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau for permission, and then hired craftsmen to manufacture it. From the previous day, the rice loaded for export was already using its husk.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jifang's Defamation Case Against Zhang Jinyuan Reaches Settlement</h3>
<p>Zhu Has Withdrawn the Private Prosecution and Accompanying Civil Lawsuit</p>
<p>Zhu Jifang, a native of Dongting Mountain at No. 31 Chengdu Road, previously filed a criminal charge in the First Special District Court against his elder brother Zhu Bohua for sending Ye et al., because his late father Zhu Songpu's concubine, You, accused him of sending Ye et al. Zhang Jinyuan, residing at No. 5 Sanfeng Lane, the same road, published a defamation in the newspaper for not repaying a loan of 1,000 taels of silver, damaging his reputation. Previously, Zhu Jifang engaged Lawyer Lin Yongqing to file a complaint, criminally suing Zhang Jinyuan for publishing a defamation and requesting compensation for losses. The complaint stated that the defendant published articles in newspapers on October 23 of last year, respectively, stating that he was legally summoned to testify in the Zhu You case against Zhu Bohua for sending Ye et al., and that his testimony was false. On October 20 of the same year, he published a newspaper article, without cause, stating that the plaintiff borrowed 1,000 taels of silver from him and had not repaid it after the due date, and made the comment that the world's customs are declining and people's hearts are not as they used to be. The accusations made by the plaintiff were sufficient to damage the plaintiff's reputation and constitute the crime of defamation under Article 325, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. This should be subject to punishment according to law. Furthermore, since the publication of the newspaper article, the plaintiff's credit and reputation have suffered great losses, and friends and relatives are suspicious and do not trust him. As a result, his position and business have been affected. This should be approved as an accompanying civil suit, ordering compensation for the equivalent losses and publishing an apology to restore his reputation, among other things. A few days ago, in the afternoon, Presiding Judge Liu from the Ninth Criminal Division of the First Special District Court tried the case. The defendant himself did not arrive, but his agent, Lawyer Yu Chengxiu, appeared in court and stated that his client was willing to publish an apology in the newspaper and write a letter to the plaintiff stating that there was a misunderstanding. The plaintiff then withdrew the private prosecution and the accompanying civil lawsuit.</p>
<h3>Pawning Mahjong Tiles, Speaking Harsh Words; Store Owner Angered, Stabs with a Candle Sign</h3>
<p>Both Sides Were at Fault</p>
<p>Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment, Suspended</p>
<p>Qian Youji, a Jiangyin native, residing on Temple Street in the city, sold mahjong tiles. On the 10th of this month, around 3 PM, he brought four sets of bone tiles to Cai Decheng's used goods store at 889 East Seward Road in Hongkou, run by a Chaozhou native. He asked for six yuan per set, but Cai only offered three and a half yuan. Qian then spoke rudely, saying that at such a price, even getting your wife down here wouldn't make it happen, and repeatedly poked Cai's forehead with his finger, saying "Cold!" Cai, burning with anger, became furious. He grabbed a white copper candle holder from the store and stabbed Qian in the chest with the sharp end of the candle. Fortunately, Qian was wearing a cotton-padded jacket and robe, so he only suffered minor injuries and fell to the ground calling for help. Chinese Detective Zhao Ruisheng arrived after hearing the alarm, arrested Cai, and took him to the Hongshan Police Station. He reported the situation to the head detective, who ordered Cai to be detained. The detective also sent the injured Qian to Tongren Hospital for treatment. The next morning, the police station sent Cai Decheng to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. Police lawyer Zhang Tianyin recounted the events, and Detective Zhao explained the situation. The candle holder was presented as evidence. Qian Youji's injuries were minor; he was bandaged by the doctor and released from the hospital immediately. In his statement, Qian claimed that the defendant disliked the price of the tiles and threw them to the ground, causing an argument. Without asking why, Cai took a candle sign and stabbed him in the chest, causing injury. Cai, when questioned, admitted knowing Qian and recounted the events of the day, saying that he had spoken harshly due to the low price offered for the bone tiles. He pleaded for leniency, saying that he had been insulted during the New Year and was driven to anger. Judge Fen sentenced Cai Decheng to three months imprisonment, suspended for three years. The police lawyer abandoned the appeal and released him.</p>
<h3>Wusong Gambling Bust, Police Officer Accidentally Killed; Case Sent to Court</h3>
<p>In the barracks of Wusong, there was a large gambling den. Patrol Captain Dong Jingyun from the First Precinct of the Seventh District led officers to arrest the gamblers. The gamblers resisted arrest, and Dong fired a warning shot, accidentally killing police officer Hu Changxi. This incident has been reported before. Now, the First Precinct of the Seventh District has sent the patrol captain and gambling ringleaders, along with nineteen gamblers, including Yuan Da Mao, Gu Haolin, Shen Fusheng, Jin Yunqing, and Pan Kang, to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Municipal Committee member Tang Chengshu submitted a report stating that the patrol captain had been a patrolman in the First Precinct of the Seventh District. Last year, during the January 28th Incident, he participated in the resistance against the enemy, risking his life. Due to this meritorious service, he was promoted to patrol captain. This accidental killing of a police officer was excusable, so he specially pleaded for the brave officer to be treated leniently. The Public Security Bureau handed the case over to the Third Section for review. Because it involved a life, the police captain and nineteen gamblers were sent to the local court for interrogation yesterday.</p>

<h3>County Agricultural Education Center Requests Mandatory Reading for Autonomous Personnel</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Farmers' Education Center, recognizing that 60% of the county's population is illiterate, and that some township chiefs and deputy chiefs, as well as chief and deputy leaders, are also illiterate, believes that these leaders, who guide the villages and influence the people, should first practice what they preach and stimulate interest in learning. This would gradually reduce the number of illiterate people in the county. With the opening of various district people's schools, the Center has submitted a request to the County Education Bureau, asking it to forward the request to the County Government, ordering all illiterate township chiefs and deputy chiefs, as well as leaders, to enroll in schools nearby.</p>

<h3>Becoming a Monk and Returning to Lay Life</h3>
<p>│Reply to Yesterday's Letter from Ms. Jiang Xin│</p>
<p>Answer: A brief reply to the questions in your letter is as follows! ㈠ "Are monks beneficial to the country and society, or are they detrimental to the country and society?" This question should be posed as follows: Is religion beneficial to the country and society, or is it detrimental to the country and society? Because so-called monks, in China, are Buddhist monks, Daoist priests, and nuns, that is, followers of Buddhism and Taoism. To know whether such followers are beneficial to the country and society, one must first ask whether the religion itself is beneficial or harmful. Our answer is! There are a hundred harms and not a single benefit. Or, one could say it benefits a few but harms many; it benefits the oppressors but harms the oppressed; it benefits the exploiters but harms the exploited. Here, we strongly avoid the complex discussion of the origin of religion and its theories, and only draw the following conclusions from historical research: (1) Religion is the poison or opium used by the ruling minority in an unequal society to numb the consciousness of the majority of the ruled; (2) Religion is a tool used by exploiters and oppressors to alleviate the rebellious and hostile feelings of the exploited and oppressed; (3) Religion is the pastime of the leisured class; (4) Religion wears the compassionate face of universal salvation, but is in reality the abyss of all human evils; (5) Religion is something that injures human nature and goes against the laws of nature. From this, it can be seen that monks are harmful to the country and society, and not beneficial. ㈡ Monks become monks mostly because they have no food to eat or because their parents donated them. Both of these are issues of livelihood, not issues of reputation. When you became a monk, it was not for reputation; so when you return to lay life, it is not for reputation either. Not only is the coming and going of ordinary monks and nuns unrelated to reputation, but even Chinese scholar-officials who call themselves lay Buddhists regard their precepts as worthless. He Fei, who was famous for his mastery of Buddhist scriptures and his pure lay Buddhist practice, would expound on Buddhism to gain fame when he retired from office. Once his official career prospered, he would put the Buddhist scriptures on the shelf. A late friend of mine once mocked him in a poem, saying, "There is no room left on his body for Chang'an, all things are like ashes, just winter cold; the cart wheel is covered in yellow dust one foot deep; he enters the door as a Buddha, and exits as an official!" This poem truly penetrates the essence of Chinese Buddhist laymen (and, to a lesser extent, monks)! We now formally answer your second question: "A monk returning to lay life" is by no means a disgraceful thing. Not only is it not a disgraceful thing, but it is an extremely honorable thing. Why? Monks, Taoist priests, and nuns are nothing but excrescences in society. They are lazy and encourage human indolence. What is more shameful than this? Now that you have left this passive empty door and returned to the path of active life, this shows that you have a positive and striving spirit, which is extremely honorable. ㈢ A monk returning to lay life should never have to obtain the consent of his master. He should decide freely. Because the master always regards his disciple as his own private property! As an object of oppression and exploitation, he will never agree to the disciple leaving his bondage to return to lay life. If you were to seek the master's consent, you would never achieve the goal of returning to lay life. ㈣ We dare say that there is absolutely no legal relationship between master and disciple on the point of the disciple's free return to lay life. ㈤ "If the master does not want the disciple to return to lay life and therefore seeks death," that is only the master's own desire to die.</p>
<p>What does it have to do with the disciple? I think that the Republic of China will never have such a ridiculous law that uses the master's death as a way to ensnare the disciple, and sentence the disciple to the crime of not being allowed to freely return to lay life, thereby forcing the master to commit suicide. ㈥ If you want to return to lay life, you only need to formally notify the master or file it with a lawyer. It is not a private escape. As for whether the master permits it or not, that is simply not a problem. ㈦ Your free return to lay life is your right to freedom. Your family, father, and brothers are responsible for you. If your master goes to your father and brothers to demand you back, let him go, what does it matter to you!</p>

<h3>Business School Benefits Employed, Out-of-School Youth</h3>
<p>▲Expanding specialized night school</p>
<p>▲Opening a journalism department</p>
<p>The Business School of National Central University has been operating for many years with remarkable results. The talents it has cultivated have occupied important positions in the business world, and its service to society has earned it a great reputation. President Xu Peikun, noting the large number of out-of-school youth in Shanghai, has paid more attention to specialized vocational courses. Therefore, accounting, statistics, banking, and other courses were made available as night classes to allow employed youth to study in their spare time. The excellent results of each session are comparable to urban night schools in Europe and America. In recent years, many universities in Shanghai have also added night schools in the central urban area, benefiting the educated, which is largely due to the Business School's promotion. This semester, the college originally did not plan to enroll new students for the specialized night school, but due to the large number of applicants requesting to join the classes, they made special arrangements to expand accounting, statistics, banking, and other important subjects, enrolling new students to provide relief and prevent those out of school from lamenting their isolation. The number of applicants has been extremely enthusiastic in recent days, which is also a good social phenomenon. In addition to the courses mentioned above, the college has also added a journalism specialization this semester, inviting experts to serve as professors, focusing on practice and avoiding empty theories, so that they can develop China's journalism industry in the future and plant the foundation for journalistic talent. The study period for all courses is limited to two years. After graduation, students will be awarded a specialist certificate. If they transfer to the college, the credits they have already earned will be recognized. There is no shortage of ambitious youth in Shanghai who should know to use their spare time to pursue academic excellence. It is reported that the college is scheduled to hold an examination on the 15th of this month, and you can go to report and ask for the prospectus on the same day.</p>
<h3>Huiling Middle School Starts Classes</h3>

However, the liberal arts department of the senior high school has hired Lian Xiangcheng, a literature graduate of St. John's University, to teach courses in the general theory of education and history, making the curriculum more complete. It is also reported that the school plans to move the junior high school department to Shanghai starting from the autumn semester of the 22nd year to facilitate the enrollment of young students. The senior high school department is planning to expand its business courses and add agricultural courses. The school is surrounded by rural areas, so running agricultural courses is very suitable.</p>

<h3>Agaar Wins the Scott Cup</h3>
<p>Defeats Lancashire 8-0</p>
<p>The Western Union Football Club's Scott Cup final was held yesterday at the Recreation Ground, with Agaar defeating Lancashire 8-0. The cheers and shouts were all from the world of blue-eyed "Qiu Ba" (a derogatory term for foreigners). Many Chinese went to watch to appreciate Agaar's skills. The score was 3-0 at halftime and 8-0 at the end. The referee was Marshall.</p>
<p>▲Lancashire utterly defeated. The strength was too different. From the beginning to the end of the competition, only Agaar attacked. They scored twice in the first five minutes, once again in the first half, and once again repeatedly in the second half, resulting in an 8-0 score. Even when Lancashire had opportunities, they were too slow. The scoring record is as follows: (1) Leet, (2) Leet, (3) Whalley, (4) McTavish, (5) Leet, (6) Willey, (7) Leet, (8) Lamond.</p>
<p>▲Agaar is indeed formidable. Agaar's performance truly proves that they are a first-class team. The agility, speed, and skill of the forwards in connecting passes, and the strength of their kicks, are truly impressive. The center-back line is also strong. Even the previously weak backline was free of ailments yesterday. The goalkeeper also made several brilliant saves. This Saturday, Donghua will once again face Agaar at the Recreation Ground. The outcome is difficult to predict.</p>
<p>▲Grimshaw Presents Silver Cup. After the match, Western Union President Grimshaw gave a speech in public, praising Agaar's excellent performance and encouraging Lancashire. Finally, four ladies presented the silver cup to Agaar captain Hayes, which Agaar will keep for one year.</p>

<h3>The Opinion of Mayor Wu Regarding the Far East Tour of the Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team to Wu City</h3>

<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng expressed his opinion yesterday regarding the Liangjiang basketball team's tour of Europe and the United States, stating that the ambition of the Liangjiang basketball team's trip to Europe and America, and the importance of its mission, are sufficient to represent the spirit of China's new women and the signs of the revival of the entire Chinese nation.

The plan is also meticulous and comprehensive, and has been reviewed and practically assisted by various experts, which shows the team's seriousness. There is no need to worry about failure. The future achievements can promote the development of China. How can it be lost here? Tiecheng is fortunate to be an official and has been nominated to prepare.

<p>Furthermore, Ms. Lu Lihua, the principal of Liangjiang, stated that the selection of personnel for the team must be officially announced after the committee meeting is held and reviewed by the chairman and director.

<h3>Benevolence and Righteousness versus Law</h3>
<p>— Yuanqing</p>
<p>On the surface, "benevolence and righteousness versus law" may seem unrelated, but in reality, both benevolence and righteousness and law are a kind of morality, and both can regulate people's hearts. However, benevolence and righteousness are used to "transform the people," while law is used to "awe the people." Although the two are the same kind of morality, "transforming the people" and "awing the people" are completely different! If we use law to govern the people, then without a doubt, the people will only know that they are in the abyss of sin, but will never know how to repent and do good, and step onto the broad road of "abandoning darkness and embracing the light." It will only be hard on the common people who are guilty and punished, and then guilty again, and it will only arouse the resentment of the people, leading to future troubles for the country!</p>
<p>If we look at ancient history, we can know that the Qin Dynasty's downfall was due to the severity of the law, and we can also know that Xia Yu's success in governing the country was due to using benevolence and righteousness to regulate people's hearts! Now, in this era when the new trend of the 20th century is surging and old morality is declining, people's hearts have long been depraved, and they no longer know what benevolence and righteousness are. As a result, greedy and insatiable robbers, bandits, and hooligans disregard benevolence and righteousness, plundering wealth and arson everywhere. The authority of the law has been destroyed, and the world has declined since then!</p>
<p>Therefore, the officials in power who are familiar with politics today use strict criminal law to punish their crimes, hoping that they will quickly abandon their sins and return to good.</p>
<p>However, the stricter the law becomes, the more poisonous people's hearts become. Therefore, the people only know how to be afraid of the law, but cannot use benevolence and righteousness to govern themselves. What hope is there?</p>
<p>If we use the morality of benevolence and righteousness to influence and teach them, then, to be honest, people's hearts are made of flesh. Once the influence of benevolence and righteousness penetrates people's hearts, who will not repent? Who will not step onto the broad road of "abandoning darkness and embracing the light"? Although it is said that law and benevolence and righteousness are both indispensable virtues.</p>
<h3>Quickly Arrest the Runaway</h3>
<p>— Yongzi</p>
<p>│Be Sure to Catch Both the Person and the Stolen Goods│</p>
<p>Apart from socialist countries, where all private property is confiscated and nationalized, empires, kingdoms, democracies, and republics, no matter what kind of system a country is, cannot ban its people from owning property. Because of this, every country has a law called property rights. For example, I have an ancestral Qianlong porcelain pot, which is a rare treasure. It is specially equipped with a mahogany base and placed in the natural hall as a decoration. Although this pot is not explicitly stated in the ancestor's will, nor has it been filed with the local government, this pot is my family's heirloom, and no one objects to it. Once this rare treasure, the Qianlong porcelain pot, is stolen by a sneaky thief, or robbed by a brigand with open fire, or run away by the mistress following the short man next door, then, just report it to the Public Security Bureau. One day, the person and the stolen goods will be caught together, and the Qianlong porcelain pot will be returned to the original owner. This proves that the ownership of this pot belongs to me, and no one else can occupy it, unless I am unfilial and make a deed of sale, transferring the ownership to others. The issue of the three northeastern provinces, or what the Japanese call Manchuria and Mongolia, is not a problem. It is a part of our entire China, and no one has ever said a single word against it. Even Mr. Lytton, who came from afar, admitted that the Northeast and China are historically and geographically inseparable. This fully proves that the ownership of the Northeast belongs to China. At present, although this treasure-rich land has been run away with by the mistress, one day the person and the stolen goods will be caught together, and the original owner will be returned to. But what is feared is that if the days are delayed, everything will be demolished and turned into</p>
<p>Money is spent, and although the person is caught, there is no way to hang the stolen goods, which is terrible.</p>
<h3>Waste Utilization</h3>
<p>— Master Yiyiguan</p>
<p>│Can be Used as a Tool of Aggression│</p>
<p>Ever since some gentleman invented the idea that "waste" can be "utilized," there has been no so-called "waste" in the world.</p>
<p>Originally, "waste utilization" was a very good economic method. However, if you have "waste" but don't know how to use it or throw it away, but leave it there for others to grab and use, this is the most wronged and regrettable thing! Now I feel that not only "things" are like this, but also "people." Isn't it the same?</p>
<p>We know that a person has all the five senses and hundreds of bodies, can eat and excrete, and is naturally a healthy and useful person. However, who knows that there is a kind of person in the world who, on the surface, has all the five senses and white bodies, and seems to be a healthy and useful person. But in reality, what they do has no conscience! Just imagine, if a person has no conscience, how can they still be called a healthy and useful person? Since they cannot be called a healthy and useful person, what else is it if not "waste"?</p>
<p>Although "waste" can be "utilized," can't this kind of "waste-like" person also be utilized? Therefore, when we see this kind of "waste-like person, although we are annoyed, others are eagerly seeking it and are very welcome!</p>
<p>Now, let's not talk about other things, let's just take the "traitors" in the Northeast as an example: their five senses and hundreds of bodies are all complete, they eat and excrete every day, and they are also "smart" on the surface. They seem to be healthy and useful people. However, in reality, they are all "waste" without a conscience! Alas! We cannot utilize these many "waste" ourselves, nor do we know how to throw them away. Leaving them until now, they are being utilized by others as tools of aggression. Isn't it wronged? Isn't it regrettable?</p>

<p>The economics of modern ladies are truly brilliant. Just look at the fact that they still wear thin silk cheongsams in the cold winter, and you can see a glimpse of it. A friend of mine said that the reason why he doesn't leave the seat of women on the tram is because the physique of Chinese women is too weak, so that making them stand might turn weakness into strength.</p>
<p>The fair and just law also knows inequality, because it does not have an explicit provision for women to repay inherited debts. The manuscripts written by women are always signed as Ms. ××, but why are the manuscripts written by men not signed as Mr. ××?</p>

<h3>The Adventures of the Hunjiang Dragon</h3>
<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>No woman, no children: good! I can sell fish at the market myself, and buy a pot of wine, just like in Yangjiawan! But the ghosts and demons, I got involved with this widow, wanting to buy rouge and apply fragrant powder to flirt with others. Bah! Monster! I'm blind, running into this stinky thing!" At this late hour, he was filled with anger, fueled by alcohol, and went out to spear some fish, preparing to go to the market tomorrow. But when he thought that the woman had taken the child and fled to an unknown place today, and he could only drink a little wine quietly, he didn't feel broken. After scolding fiercely, his mood was very calm and comfortable. In the future, he should live a free and unrestrained life like before, he thought.</p>
<p>Then he ridiculed himself for secretly sneaking into the widow's bedroom one spring night last year and using money to buy her gentle flattery.... However, this temporarily stirred up warm impressions in his peaceful heart. But because he hated the woman's stubborn mind too deeply, just like the lake water, it immediately calmed down after the wind passed.</p>
<p>His drunken body was finally brought to the old elm tree in Lingjiawan. On the bare branches of this elm tree, a few black spots were the nests of crows. They could be seen clearly in the moonlight. The water of Lingjiawan was silent, shining like silver. As usual, he put down the harpoon first, and then the fishing net. He raised his head again, instinctively glanced at the sky, "Good moonlight, give me a profit, let me spear a few more big fish," he prayed mysteriously in his heart. He also smacked the remaining wine dregs on his lips. He temporarily abandoned all painful thoughts.</p>
<p>But the night was so quiet, only the wind blew the withered water plants, rustling softly and densely. The villages near Lingjiawan were buried in the water-like moonlight, dream-like gray and black. He accidentally coughed dryly, which stirred up the 凉fish at the bottom of the bay, swimming gently in the water. The surface of the water also connected to form rounded or carp-patterned silver waves.</p>
<p>This was his opportunity to widen his drunken eyes to find the 'fish's nest'. He quickly repeated the process of picking up the white iron harpoon, and the white iron of the harpoon emitted a few swaying rays of light. He approached the shore, quietly and secretly; lurking in the reed flowers near the shore, like a dog pricking up its ears, stretching its neck like a crane, and the eagle's eyes also emitted serious and attentive light at the same time.</p>
<h3>In the Tide</h3>
<p>— Female Hero</p>
<p>│Only Swimming Fish Can Best Cope with the Tide│</p>
<p>The river water today is exceptionally clear, green like olive oil. The tide from the upper reaches flows from east to west, and the water patterns are like endless green silk threads. Occasionally, when it hits the reefs in the river, it emits one or two or three intermittent sound waves, which is nature playing music. This is a pure and bright paradise unique to the society where the sky is dark and you can't see your fingers.</p>
<p>Look! Pink peach petals are spread flat on the water, and there are also purple-green duckweeds standing there. They are all shy, following the tide, neither fast nor slow, just like the speed of the tide, inseparable, closely following.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, following such a beautiful tide is the happiest thing in the world, and undoubtedly, following the tide is the most stable thing in the world. Therefore, today, the clever swimming fish are also heading in the direction of the tide, advancing forward.</p>
<p>Today's river water is so turbid and unclear, 55 is so disgusting, and in the strands of water, there are a few peach blossoms and a few duckweeds that have no opinion of their own, walking unnaturally with the tide, but the clever fish are not seen swimming.</p>
<p>Today's tide is so urgent, flowing down as if flying, it is a pity that the peach petals are rolled over in the vortex.</p>
<p>Look, the reef is coming, the peach petals and duckweed are about to hit it, some are crushed to pieces, some are bleeding, and some are lucky enough to flow through, … only, that swimming fish, that clever swimming fish, is slowly coming in a calm and unhurried manner.</p>
<h3>Women's Optimism in Marriage</h3>
<p>— Ms. Huizhu</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "Harmony in the family brings prosperity in everything." This saying is most reasonable. I don't like to hear people say that there will be any disharmony in a family, but the world is so big, and the society is so crowded, that there are many disgruntled couples who play out many unfaithful stories and the tragedy of divorce!</p>
<p>The so-called "lesson from the past," "warning for the future"; society is full of the argument that "the man is unfaithful" and "the husband is not good." The deep descriptions in novels and the emotional performances on stage have made ordinary women see marriage as a dreaded path, and marrying someone seems to be a very unfortunate thing; you pass it to me, and I pass it to her, until now, everyone's mind is full of various terrifying phenomena.</p>
<p>If women could understand everything, couples would never become disgruntled couples.</p>
<p>It is indeed true that there is no couple in the world who does not like family harmony. Naturally, there should not be a system of respecting husbands and belittling wives, and there is no need to reverse it and have a "lioness of Hedong." In any case, couples must not be serious about everything. Wives do not have to be frightened when they see their husband's shadow, and wives should not have endless suspicions about their husbands.</p>
<p>Marriage is indeed a happy event. If you step into the path of love, you will see men loving you like crazy, treating you intimately, and solemnly getting engaged and married, like gods, how sweet and happy, you want to spoil, the happiness in the honeymoon is true happiness!</p>
<p>Whispers in the pillow, warmth and care, it is truly heaven and earth, unparalleled happy event! Just look at a pair of new couples, sitting side by side, whispering sweet words, envying the bystanders, and you, just following the mountain vows and sea alliances, with the same branch connected, at this time, maybe you are ignoring everything and acting as if no one else is around.</p>
<p>The love of marriage, this love is of course considered happy, but getting married means getting a faithful lifelong partner. Suffering together, knowing each other, but at the same time, both parties must still "respect each other like guests and love each other like friends" outside of love. Have you ever seen it? Many harmonious and loving old couples, how dignified is their attitude! The so-called same heart and same feelings. It is not just paying attention to the romance, but "loyalty and sincerity" are indispensable attitudes.</p>
<p>The future of couples is very broad, and marriage is only the initial step in life. If you can recall everything afterwards, there are many things that will make you laugh to yourself. I can definitely say that marriage is a great happiness in life, especially for us women!</p>
<p>There are many people who are looking forward to having children. Seeing other people's fathers holding and mothers carrying, they are full of problems: "Good people and beautiful children are a blessing"! Envy is endless!</p>
<p>Then the social rumors, the descriptions in novels, and the performances on stage, these many "disgruntled couples" and "family tragedies" are not necessarily all facts.</p>

<h3>Shanghai City Medicine in the Last Ten Years (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Pang Jingzhou</p>
<p>Chinese philanthropists, if they invest in establishing hospitals, rarely refrain from asking about their faith, and in terms of personnel management, they cannot adhere to the attitude of "those employed should not be doubted, and those doubted should not be employed." Furthermore, they even treat hospitals like government offices, with board members often forcing 'eight-legged essays' (referring to standard essays required for civil service exams) on medical directors, introducing a trainee nurse today and a registration clerk tomorrow. Even tea servers and cooks come from the hospital director or board members. As a result, the board members themselves look and say, "Why is our hospital not as good as foreign hospitals?" They ultimately feel dissatisfied. They must understand that in a truly qualified hospital, from the doctors to the hospital attendants, all have a different kind of medical training. Look at how the information desks in their hospitals are staffed by well-trained nurses. Even the head of documentation at Peking Union Medical College Hospital is a doctor with good Chinese writing skills. Naturally, there is no inappropriateness. If we were to establish a rudimentary hospital, and the board member who contributes the most is a former Qing dynasty candidate official, it is inevitable that a 'likin' (a form of internal customs tax) grabber will come to be a registration clerk. Therefore, his demeanor towards patients will not be very pleasant, and the hospital's reputation will be affected by these small details.</p>
<p>My many arguments may be more adept at criticizing others than at criticizing myself. So, in reverse, I must say that there is also a real lack of talent in our medical field for managing hospitals. Tracing the cause, those who study medicine mostly aim to open their own practice or research basic science as their future career path. Therefore, they only focus on the principles and techniques of each discipline and never spare any thought for hospital equipment and management. Even those who have been abroad for many years, interned in many hospitals, and paid attention all the time are ultimately very few. Those who study medicine in China feel even more that there is no one to learn from because the place where they are located is already not a large-scale and well-organized hospital. Even those few who have a natural talent for hospital management and a small number who have aspirations to run a hospital and pay attention to research, or those physicians who are rich in talent, are bound to be absorbed into the following places: ㈠ private sanatoriums they run themselves; ㈡ small-scale private hospitals; ㈢ absolutely orderly and clean clinics. And the above three items often occupy a superior position in society. Thus, the talent for managing public hospitals becomes increasingly scarce. Therefore, in Shanghai, we can see better private hospitals but lack better public hospitals. Furthermore, sometimes the leaders of public hospitals still hold old merchant or government office mindsets, using personnel often based on the principle of low wages, preferring to let the staff cheat on the side. But how can a hospital be a place where cheating can be done? Are doctors people who are allowed to cheat? Thus, the medical director of a public hospital follows this custom and becomes a poorly paid position. Talented and knowledgeable people already have private hospitals they can run and good clinics they can open. Who would still want to be a drudge under low salaries and heavy responsibilities? I have personally handled hospitals. Under my own voluntary guidance, using my personal connections, I hired a medical director with a monthly salary of 200 yuan, who was a foreign university graduate with a doctorate. It can be considered cheap and of good quality. However, when the hospital was short of funds, the board's tone seemed to suggest that the medical staff's salary was still too expensive. On the one hand, I had to consider the doctors' lives, on the other hand, I had to understand the board's psychology and reluctantly maintain their interest, and on the other hand, I had to increase my own voluntary responsibility without reducing the effectiveness of medical services. Caught in the middle, it was very difficult. However, because public hospitals are needed by the city, I did not hesitate to compromise and reluctantly exert myself.</p>
<p>Scientific Ways to Achieve Longevity (6)</p>
<h3>(9) Hygiene During Pregnancy</h3>
<p>— Yu Songyun</p>
<p>The first three months and the last three months of pregnancy are the two periods when the most obvious subjective pain is felt. In the early stages of pregnancy, one often feels unwell in the morning and suffers from nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, salivation, acid reflux, frequent urination, and nerve pain.</p>
<p>In the late stages of pregnancy, the enlargement of the uterus often causes mechanical obstacles, such as: movement disorders, insomnia, abdominal wall tension, lower limb edema, varicose veins, and stomach disorders.</p>
<p>Whenever severe pain is encountered, it is certainly necessary to apply appropriate treatment, but when it is not very severe, one must not arbitrarily take medication, because pregnancy is a physiological function. Therefore, it is best for pregnant women not to change their normal life. Moreover, the first key point of hygiene during pregnancy is that whatever is done, it must not be excessive. The following points should be noted, and are described separately below:</p>
<p>㈠ Prohibitions… Excessive exercise, cold lower abdomen, abdominal pressure, colds, gastrointestinal disorders, long-distance travel by rickshaw, horse-drawn carriage, car, train, steamship, etc., going up and down stairs, horseback riding, weightlifting, reaching high places, cold water baths, sea baths, foot baths, sitz baths, dancing, sitting or standing for too long, long-time washing, etc., are all prohibited.</p>
<p>㈡ Diet… Food and drink should be chosen that are easily digestible and nutritious. All things should be moderate. Although it is not necessary to force a change in normal habits, one must not abuse foods that are difficult to digest, unfamiliar, or contain strong ingredients, such as mustard, pepper, yams, etc. Furthermore, stimulants such as alcoholic beverages, strong tea, and coffee must also be avoided for the sake of caution. What is even more important is that in the second half of pregnancy, one must not eat too much.</p>
<p>㈢ Clothing… Clothing varies with the climate, but it is best to be loose, not hindering the chest and abdomen, and suitable for warmth. Also, use a wide cotton or flannel cloth to gently wrap the abdomen. The purpose is to maintain temperature and fix the fetal position, but it must not be tightly bound.</p>
<p>㈣ Exercise… Pregnant women must have appropriate exercise, such as: outdoor walks, fresh air, looking up at the sky, and bathing in the sunlight, which can make the spirit refreshed. If taking care of housework at home, it is not impossible, but it must also be done in moderation. Dancing, horseback riding, weightlifting, long-distance travel, and strenuous exercise are strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>㈤ Bowel Movements… If suffering from constipation, it should be adjusted quickly and moderate exercise should be done. Drink a little cold water or cold milk every morning. A bowel movement must be done once a day at a fixed time to make it a habit. Eat some fruit after each meal. If it is still ineffective, use a soap water or glycerin enema, or give a mild laxative, but never use a drastic laxative to avoid miscarriage.</p>
<p>㈥ Urination… The matter of urination must also be paid attention to often and must be checked from time to time. Extra attention must be paid to protein in the urine. In the early stages of pregnancy, one should prevent the accumulation of protein, because this often makes it easy to suffer from retroversion of the pregnant uterus.</p>
<p>㈦ Cleaning… One must bathe at any time during pregnancy, because the external genital area secretes too much, resulting in dirtiness and uncleanness. It is best to use warm water and wash it often, but do not take sitz baths or foot baths, for fear of miscarriage.</p>
<p>㈧ Breasts… For those with poorly developed or sunken nipples, it is advisable to often use clean fingers to try to lift them out, and the nipples must be wiped lightly with clean water or alcohol every day.</p>
<p>㈨ Spirit… Pregnant women must be quiet. For first-time pregnant women or those who have had difficult births and have fearful thoughts, it is best to comfort them at all times to avoid mental distress. All exciting emotional matters, as well as novels, dramas, etc., must not be approached or experienced firsthand. Sleep must be sufficient, and the mind must not be overworked.</p>
<p>㈩ Sexual Activity… After conception, it is advisable to limit sexual activity in general. In the second half of pregnancy, it must be strictly prohibited.</p>
<p>In short, hygiene during pregnancy must be done from the daily habits that do not hinder the progress of pregnancy. Although there is no need to change, drastic changes in mental and physical states should of course be avoided as much as possible. In particular, attention should be paid to daily diet, bowel movements, and sleep, and they should be regulated.</p>
<h3>On the Theory of Drug Action (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Yugong</p>
<p>Not only that. In the past, doctors often made wild guesses about the efficacy of drugs based on their shape, color, and smell. In China, ginseng is regarded as a panacea for all diseases. However, there are many types of ginseng, and their forms vary. It is said that the most valuable are those that resemble the human form. The five ginsengs and five colors are matched to the five internal organs. Therefore, ginseng entering the spleen is called yellow ginseng; sand ginseng entering the lungs is called white ginseng; black ginseng entering the kidneys is called mysterious ginseng; dogbane ginseng entering the liver is called purple ginseng; and red ginseng entering the heart is called red ginseng. Different colors indicate different efficacies. To the fullest extent, there are countless examples. No wonder cow urine and horse manure, and broken drum skins can be comprehensively included, and the Chinese Materia Medica has become a vast and voluminous work.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned phenomena are not unique to China. They also existed in Europe and the West. In the time of Galen in the second century, the abundance of drugs was already astonishing. There were thirty volumes on the preparation of drugs and fourteen volumes on treatment. By the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, the types of drugs became even more numerous, numbering no fewer than six thousand types in formularies, pharmaceutical books, and prescription books. The method of administering drugs at that time was just like China's today. Each dose contained more than ten different ingredients. Not only did physicians not understand the effects of mixing various drugs, but they also did not understand the individual efficacy of each drug. It was not until the late eighteenth century and the early nineteenth century that medicine made great strides. Cultivating bacteria made it known that they were the medium of infectious diseases. Pathological anatomy made it known whether clinical diagnoses were accurate. Diagnostic and therapeutic methods became increasingly precise. Past superstitions were swept away. What was once treated with more than six thousand drugs is now regarded as a barbaric act. Various drugs are first tested on animals, such as dogs, cats, rabbits, and guinea pigs, to test their efficacy and verify their toxicity, and then they are applied to humans. To take the most commonly used drug, digitalis, as an example, about one hundred and fifty years ago, an old woman in Shropshire, England, had a secret recipe containing several drugs that could treat edema. Its efficacy was unmatched by any drug at the time. The recipe was passed around until it reached the hands of English physician William Withering. After his investigation, he discovered that of the various drugs in the recipe, only one was effective for treating edema, and that was digitalis. Therefore, Withering spent ten years treating all patients with edema with digitalis. After ten years of experience, he wrote a monograph systematically recording the efficacy of digitalis and the dosage given to patients. Only then was it determined that digitalis was an effective drug for treating edema. However, Withering was still like the old woman with the secret recipe, knowing the use but not knowing the principle, knowing that it worked but not knowing why. The reason was that Withering's results were based solely on experience and not on theory. Therefore, he was unable to fully understand it. After numerous scientists conducted animal experiments, the mysteries were finally broken. It was then known that the reason why digitalis could treat edema was because it indirectly made the heart beat slower and stronger.</p>
<p>This kind of invention can be said to have begun with experience and been promoted to success by experimentation. Therefore, if one knows nothing of pharmacology, using medicine is no different from using patients as experimental tools. What could be more absurd? But how easy is it to fully understand pharmacology? Please continue to use digitalis as an example. Suppose it is said that a patient with swollen feet should take two milliliters of digitalis tincture diluted in half a cup of water every six hours. Even this simple prescription raises several questions. The questions are, why can digitalis treat swollen feet? What is the general effect of digitalis? On what tissues in the body does digitalis have what effect? Is digitalis effective for all types of swollen feet? Why is it taken orally instead of injected? Why is it diluted? Why every six hours instead of every two or three hours? To be able to answer each question, one must know pharmacology, physiology, and pathology. Only with a considerable understanding of physiology, pathology, and pharmacology can one use it properly. Otherwise, one is no different from a doctor before the eighteenth century and cannot be considered a modern medical practitioner.</p>

<h3>Using Chinese Medicine in the West (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Zhou Mengbai</p>
<p>Source　㈥ Bitter Almond Armenica Amara</p>
<p>This product is the mature seed of the Rosaceae Prunus Armenica Linn'e var. Amara. It can completely replace European bitter almonds. Therefore, the Chinese Pharmacopoeia lists this product instead of bitter almonds.</p>
<p>Shape　This product is heart-shaped, about fifteen millimeters long, twelve millimeters wide, and seven millimeters thick, with one end pointed and one end rounded. The seed coat is brown and thin, with a scaly appearance. The seed is non-endospermic and has two large oily cotyledons. It tastes bitter. When ground with cold water, it emulsifies and emits a unique odor.</p>
<p>Composition　This product contains fatty oil, namely bitter almond oil, which accounts for more than half of the total. If this product is crushed, mixed with water, and distilled, one can obtain benzaldehyde because the amygdalin glycoside contained in this product is broken down into benzaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and glucose by the enzyme emulsin.</p>
<p>Test　If this product is added to a dilute solution of ferrous chloride, it should show a deep yellow color. If this product is added to a silver nitrate solution and shaken, although it will combine with benzaldehyde and precipitate, it should still retain the aroma of volatile bitter almond oil. If two milliliters of bitter almond water made from it is added to one milliliter of a hydrochloric acid test solution, turbidity should occur within ten minutes, and obvious turbidity should occur within twenty minutes. Otherwise, it is an artificial product.</p>
<p>Efficacy　This product is often made into bitter almond water for application, but it is rarely used alone because it is difficult to achieve antitussive and sedative effects on its own. Therefore, it is often used in combination with other drugs for respiratory inflammation. Not only is the efficacy obvious, but it also has the power to correct the taste. It is commonly used for expectoration, bronchitis, and asthma.</p>
<p>Storage　The water solution of this product is easily deteriorated by the action of air and sunlight. Therefore, it should be filled in glass bottles and placed in a cool, dark place.</p>
<p>(Appendix Old Saying)　Bitter, pungent, sweet, warm and mild, drains the lungs, relieves the muscles, can induce sweating, dispel wind, dispel cold, lower qi, resolve phlegm, moisten dryness, and eliminate accumulation. It makes wheat flour and bean flour rot when near it. It is slightly toxic and can kill insects, treat sores, and counteract dog poison and tin poison. It should not be used by those with lung deficiency and cough. Almonds with two kernels are deadly because the flower has six petals, which is abnormal.</p>
<h3>Talking About Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>Mature men experience ejaculation when sexual intercourse reaches its peak, which is a very important task in human reproduction, but without sexual intercourse, when the penis erects and ejaculates in a dream, it is called nocturnal emission. The frequency of nocturnal emission is not fixed. Some have one or two emissions per week, some have one every two weeks, and some have one every four weeks. In short, the frequency varies greatly depending on each person's constitution and life situation. If a married man has not had sexual intercourse for a long time, the accumulation of semen may reflexively cause ejaculation at night. Such nocturnal emissions are often accompanied by obscene dreams. The next day, the man does not feel any kind of pain mentally or physically, or may even feel mental peace. Moreover, the interval between nocturnal emissions is at least one week. From a medical point of view, such nocturnal emissions should not be regarded as a pathological phenomenon, but rather as physiological ejaculation. Therefore, healthy young men, both physically and mentally, often experience nocturnal emissions.</p>
<p>As for pathological nocturnal emissions, they are different. First, they occur frequently, several times a week, or even not only every night, but also during the day. The man often feels the penis erect. Leakage of semen occurs during bowel movements or urination, during exercise and walking, during travel in vehicles, and when clothing and bedding come into contact. In more severe cases, nocturnal emissions can occur when seeing beautiful women, or during moments of shock and grief, when the man is emotionally moved. With such severe nocturnal emissions, the patient's fatigue can be said to reach its extreme. Even if the nocturnal emissions are not so severe, if they occur repeatedly, the patient also feels tired and without strength. Memory and thinking power are reduced, and symptoms such as headache, head heaviness, tinnitus, palpitations, fatigue and tremors in the limbs, back pain, mental haze, aversion to work, and depression occur.</p>
<p>Speaking of the causes of nocturnal emission, apart from the physiological nocturnal emissions mentioned above, there are many causes of pathological nocturnal emissions. The first cause is neurasthenia. For example, excessive sexual activity, masturbation, or stopping intercourse before ejaculation for the purpose of contraception, can cause sexual neurasthenia after repeated performance, and sexual neurasthenia can cause nocturnal emission. The second cause is diseases of the urinary and reproductive organs and other nearby organs, such as phimosis, prostatitis, prostatic hypertrophy, chronic gonorrhea, diabetes, cystitis, bladder stones, urethral stricture, urethritis, and other diseases. The third cause is diseases of the nervous system, such as spinal cord disease, myelitis, and brain tumors. In addition, all kinds of overwork, poor environment, and unhealthy lifestyle are causes of nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>Regarding the treatment and methods of nocturnal emission, since the causes of nocturnal emission are as mentioned above, if you want to treat nocturnal emission, the first thing to do is to eliminate the cause. This requires a doctor's diagnosis and treatment, but there are also many methods and things that the patient can do and pay attention to. They are written below one by one, so please pay attention.</p>
<p>㈠ Patients who have a history of masturbation, excessive sexual activity, and stopping intercourse before ejaculation should repent and strive to eliminate these habits.</p>
<p>㈡ Avoid overwork, give adequate rest, and have a regular lifestyle.</p>
<p>㈢ After wetting a towel with cold water and wringing it out, rub the genitals and the inner surface of the thighs every day. If you do it without interruption, it often has miraculous effects.</p>
<p>㈣ You should restrict your drinking before going to bed, because a full bladder can cause nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>㈤ The time when nocturnal emission occurs most often is four to five minutes after midnight in the morning. Most of the time, the bladder is full. To avoid nocturnal emission caused by a full bladder, do not oversleep. Get up immediately to urinate once and then go back to sleep.</p>
<p>㈥ When sleeping, it is best to sleep on your side with your legs bent, because during nocturnal emission, the penis is mostly erect. When the erect penis touches the pants or bedding, it triggers ejaculation.</p>
<p>㈦ The bedding should not be too warm, especially the feet. Overheating can cause hyperemia in the lower body, which will cause nocturnal emission.</p>
<p>㈧ Constipation can cause the genitals to become congested, which can also cause nocturnal emission. Therefore, bowel movements should be smooth every day.</p>
<p>㈨ Pornographic books, illustrations, and movies should naturally not be watched.</p>

<h3>Random Talk About Lung Disease (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hou Guangdi</p>
<p>The theory that eating raw beef and raw beef juice can cure tuberculosis was invented by two gentlemen named Hoel in Germany and was endorsed by Philip of Edinburgh City. The principle is that muscle tissue and its plasma can generate anti-tuberculosis properties, prevent the growth of tuberculosis bacteria, and the increase and storage of protein input into the human body is sufficient to promote the formation of fibrous tissue. When tested on dogs, it suddenly saw miraculous effects, but when Brown tested it, the dogs died instead. Later, an expert named Lipbrais thoroughly analyzed Phil's theory, and his conclusion was that eating it during the early stages of tuberculosis is indeed very effective, but it is slightly less effective in later stages. The weight of the eater increases, the pulse slows down, and the blood pressure improves. The muscles are firmer, the body temperature gradually stabilizes, the hemoglobin increases, the digestion improves, and the affected area gradually heals. In short, all kinds of nutrition rely on digestion. Doctors should not be bound by preconceived notions. Sterilization therapy is divided into drug therapy and injection of tuberculin. The first type is mainly Kiasu for internal use. The efficacy of this drug is said to be bactericidal or digestive. Each has its own saying. Therefore, it is widely used. This drug can also be used for steam inhalation. It is quite effective for those with dry coughs and excessive phlegm. Many new drugs have been produced from Kiasu, such as Creossotaic, Suotal, Geossot, Gualacol, Tｈｉｏｃｏｌ, and Sｉｒｏｂｉｎ, numbering no less than dozens, but their effects are similar. The remaining therapies include arsenic agents, urea agents, iodine agents, and benzoin agents. They were once used for a while but were eventually abandoned. The second type of therapy was started by Koch. It involves filtering out the toxic fluid from cultured tuberculosis bacteria and making it into a solution called tuberculin. Injecting it into the human body can increase antitoxins in the body and eliminate tuberculosis bacteria and bacterial toxins. There are three types in total. The usage: 1. The gradual progression method of Trolot, which starts with a very small injection dose and gradually increases it every three or four days to avoid the main objective of reaction. 2. The reaction method, which uses an injection dose to stimulate a mild reaction to produce the maximum amount of antitoxins. 3. The opsonin index method of Rato (Ｏｐｓｃｎｉｃ Ｉｎｄｅｘ Ｍｅｈｏｄ). Its usage is based on the opsonin index of Erlich's fluid for injection. Among the three methods, gradual progression is the best.</p>
<p>Patients who are injected with tuberculin must have some resistance and be in generally good condition. It is suitable for cases where the affected area of the lungs is mild, or where the disease is deep-seated but not in the active stage due to hygienic recuperation, or where the disease is widespread but the general condition is good. If the body temperature is already high and exceeds 100 degrees, it is not suitable for injection.</p>
<h3>The Social Mission of Doctors (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Fan Shouyuan</p>
<p>Although I have never put pen to paper to tear up a draft, this little idea, this concept, has been swirling around in my mind for a long time. The reasons why I haven't written it down are twofold: first, I couldn't think of a suitable and appropriate title; second, I feared that the article would be too long and unsuitable for the newspaper format. Therefore, I have put it aside until now, never having started writing. Recently, the "Shenbao Medical Weekly" has been published for several issues. Not only is it extensive in scope, but its content and writing are also very excellent and valuable. The medical community has gained such a powerful medical publication that promotes new scientific medicine, socializes new medicine, and makes it accessible to the public. It cannot be said that this is not a great kindness from the "Shenbao." Not only should we in the medical profession welcome it, but all readers of the "Shenbao" and the entire public should express their infinite sympathy and welcome!</p>
<p>The title of the article is set as "The Social Mission of Doctors." Although I still feel it is not entirely satisfactory, since there is no better title, I can ignore it. As for the length of the text, I don't think it will be a problem. In recent issues of the "Shenbao Medical Weekly," there have been many excellent and beautiful medical essays. Although I certainly know that I cannot write excellent and beautiful prose, as long as the length of the text does not limit the thoughts in my mind, that is enough.</p>
<p>Forgive me for saying some idle words that are not relevant to the main text. Now let's write the main text, "to get back to the point."</p>
<p>To talk about the social mission of doctors, we must first ask about the relationship between doctors and human society. Human life inevitably involves the pain and suffering of illness. Relieving this pain and suffering of illness is medicine. The person who performs the duty of relieving this human suffering is the doctor. Therefore, the doctor is the executor of relieving human suffering. Without medicine, unexpected pain and suffering of humans would not be easily relieved, and often lead to the loss of life. But even with medicine, if there are no people to apply it, it is still in vain. Therefore, the relationship between doctors and human society is so profound that human society cannot do without the existence of doctors for a single day. Therefore, it is very clear that the greatest and only mission of doctors is to apply medicine to treat and prevent diseases and sufferings that occur in humans, in order to maintain the goal of a healthy and happy life. Such unfortunate suffering and unexpected pain are closely related to the social living environment and the level of individual knowledge. The propertied people who drive cars and live in Western-style houses are certainly less susceptible to the infection of pain and disease than the propertyless poor who live in slums. Compared to the general public who do not know what hygiene is, people who have medical knowledge and make their daily lives hygienic naturally have fewer opportunities to contract diseases. In China, with such a terrible social environment and such a poor lifestyle, the increase in diseases among the people is inevitable, but the lack of medical care to treat pain and suffering is an undeniable fact. Chinese society is so terrible and so fragmented, but we are citizens of the Republic of China, and we are Chinese doctors who practice medicine in Chinese society. All of us who are doctors should have deep sympathy, understand the mission of being a doctor, and intensify our efforts to treat the suffering and pain of the Chinese people. We must never take the idea of making money, doing business, or even getting rich as the only purpose of a doctor; nor should we take the ignorance of the public as a good opportunity to deceive and defraud money. Treating medicine as a tool for business, wealth, or even deception and fraud loses the true mission of a doctor and declares the bankruptcy of the doctor's personality and morality. Only by applying medicine to treat the pain and suffering of the people is the greatest and only mission of a doctor!</p>

<h3>The So-Called Technocracy</h3>
<p>— Yin</p>
<p>││The Newest Economic and Political Monster││</p>
<p>The result of the European War threw the whole world into disarray. Tremendous changes have taken place in the social, economic, and political organizations. In particular, the economic disturbances have plunged everything into an abyss of utter destruction. Even the United States of America, which prides itself on "everlasting glory," has been devastated since the stock market crash of 1929. Many large banks have collapsed, many large companies have gone bankrupt, and the number of unemployed has risen from 3 million to 5 million to 10 million to 13 million! Prices are so low, and so many people are committing suicide. All of these phenomena expose the true face of capitalist society as "approaching its end." Although many hypocritical, short-sighted politicians, industrialists, and those backward economists have tried their best to save the form of capitalism from its dying state, the "disease has penetrated the bone marrow" and there is no hope of a cure. This dangerous disease is not only not being alleviated, but is getting worse every day! As a result, many different ideologies have emerged, hoping to bring about a thorough change to replace all the existing bad systems.</p>
<p>Technocracy is the newest of these many ideologies. What exactly is it? Where did it originate? What is its relationship to us? We should study these questions in detail. Here, I will first give a brief introduction.</p>
<p>This brand-new ideology has not only not appeared in China, but has only been a sensation abroad for four months. Dictionaries have not yet had time to include it, so it is very difficult to give a definite definition. Literally, "Techno" means technology and "Cracy" means politics. Combined, it is called "Technical Politics." This "Technical Politics" monster was advocated by a group of engineers in the United States last November, and one of them, Howard Scott, is the inventor of this monster. The so-called "Technical Politics" can be simply explained as: "Specifically clarifying the relationship between machines and people, and using this relationship to manage politics and control the economy." Its main principles are: ㈠ Use machines as much as possible to reduce human labor time, so that everyone has the opportunity to work, and the fear of unemployment will no longer be seen in the world, and the remaining labor will be turned to promoting human culture; ㈡ Abolish the monetary system and replace this unit with "energy," so as to achieve the point where everyone does their best and takes what they need; ㈢ Because all political and social systems change with the economy, politics should be managed by technicians responsible for improving the economy. In this way, the so-called "Technical Politics" monster is specifically produced.</p>
<p>Some people think that there is nothing new in this argument. In fact, it is quite different from other ideologies. The easiest point to distinguish is that all past ideologies have started from the standpoint of social sciences such as political science and economics, and the results have been studied. "Technical Politics," however, starts from the standpoint of technicians and experimental scientists, and the results have been studied. The former is theoretical, while the latter is experimental. This is an obvious difference. "Scientific management," "industrial rationalization," and even what the Japanese call "economic control" also study the relationship between machines and people, advocate maximizing the use of machines to produce, or centralizing economic organizations, and try to improve the economic system. However, all these methods start with "economy" and end with "economy." "Technical Politics," however, also includes the role of "politics." It can be said that it is a new kind of socialism that originated in the American social background. Because the collapse of American capitalist imperialism is suffering from "mechanical production," this production method is actually not wrong. It is only because there are fundamental defects in politics that many malpractices have arisen. This "Technical Politics" originally wanted to use the inherent characteristics of "mechanical production" to advocate the use of technicians to improve the political and economic system in a peaceful way. Therefore, even if it is called a new socialism, it is somewhat different from the socialism of Soviet Russia. It is even different from the "expert politics" advocated by Hu Shih and others in our country. "Expert politics" means that "administrative officials should be filled by people who have specialized research in the respective administrative knowledge. For example, the Minister of Foreign Affairs should be filled by people who have specialized research in foreign affairs. The mayors of each city should be filled by people who have specialized research in municipal administration." However, "Technical Politics" believes that if the economy is managed, everything will be managed. The improvement of the economy means advocating the use of machines as much as possible, and the power of technicians is responsible for handling it. Therefore, "politics" should also advocate standing on the standpoint of machines and being managed by technicians.</p>
<p>This is roughly the function of this monster. But can it be realized? Are there any malpractices? What impact does it have on humanity? Is it feasible to use such a simple principle to govern such a complex people? All of these need to be deeply studied by the readers. Here, the author is only introducing this monster to you. │Morning, February 12, 1933│</p>
<h3>Savings Banks and Regulating Civilian Finance</h3>
<p>— Feng Zhenyu</p>
<p>In recent years, the social economy has become increasingly weak. This is due to the encroachment of natural and man-made disasters. However, the fact that the majority of the middle class and lower civilians feel economic difficulties, resulting in reduced productivity, may not be without cause. Therefore, how to regulate civilian finance is a problem that needs to be solved urgently at present.</p>
<p>I have observed that banks in our country are not undeveloped. However, their use of funds always avoids the urgent needs and tends towards the non-urgent needs. This trend has become a common malpractice. For the propertied class, those with solid financial resources, even if they have no needs, banks will compete to invest. On the contrary, those who have urgent needs find it difficult to get their assistance. It is undeniable that such banks are financial institutions for the propertied class and are isolated from the civilians. However, we cannot completely blame them. It is a recognized fact that civilian loans have low interest rates and cumbersome procedures. Moreover, banks have different characteristics, and it may be difficult to consider both. Therefore, I have to place my hopes on today's savings banks.</p>
<p>Savings banks aim to absorb scattered deposits. In principle, they are financial institutions for the general public. However, what the current situation shows us can only be called one-sided civilian financial institutions. Civilians only have the convenience of scattered savings, but suffer from the inability to raise funds. In this environment, those who are keen on seeking profits are given the opportunity to exploit them with high interest rates. Those who seek loans know that they cannot afford them, but since they have no other way to borrow, they can only drink poison to quench their thirst. What is more heartbreaking than this? The way to remedy this is to improve the business policies of savings banks and pay attention to regulating non-civilian finance. Some contemporary scholars advocate imitating the Morris Plan Bank. Their purpose is the same as regulating civilian finance. However, such organizations have not been seen in our country before. I am not sure whether they can be managed properly in the future. The best plan at present is for each savings bank to refer to the Morris system and implement civilian loans, which is more efficient and effective. After all, savings banks have closer contact with civilians, and their economic situation and creditworthiness are easier to investigate. As for the loan system, it should be based on creditworthiness and conditioned on regular savings. This is the characteristic of the Morris system, and it is also what our country should learn from. After the implementation, try to make statistics. Given today's social situation, I dare to believe that at least 50% of the loan uses are for maintaining life, and more than 30% are for investment and business. The relationship between them and local security and social economy can be imagined. I hope that the authorities will take action as soon as possible. It is the good fortune of the civilians and the blessing of society.</p>
<p>Previously, Ningbo Jiaotong Bank and Shanghai Commercial Savings Bank have both established civilian loan methods. Although the matter is just beginning, I have not heard of any significant results. However, the future of civilian finance has already seen the dawn. The spirit of these two banks to serve the public despite difficulties is also admirable. If they continue to work hard, they will surely live up to our expectations in the future, which can be predicted. (But)</p>
<h3>The Impact of the Decline of the Japanese Exchange Rate on Our Country's Trade</h3>
<p>— Mao Zhenchu</p>
<p>The rise and fall of a country's foreign exchange rate directly affects the growth and decline of its foreign trade. If the foreign exchange rate rises, the purchasing power of the currency will increase. At this time, the influx of foreign goods will inevitably increase, often causing imports to exceed exports. Conversely, if the foreign exchange rate falls, the purchasing power of the currency will inevitably decrease. At this time, on the one hand, the import of foreign goods will decrease, and on the other hand, the opportunity of foreign countries' increased purchasing power can be used to export as much as possible, often entering a favorable situation of trade surplus. Since the Japanese government decided to reimplement the gold export ban, the foreign exchange rate has fluctuated sharply. The decline in the exchange rate is only less than half of the price at the time of the ban lift. As far as the current situation is concerned, although it has risen slightly, the fluctuations are very small and do not affect the overall situation. Although the result of this exchange rate decline will inevitably lead to a considerable increase in domestic prices (according to recent Japanese price statistics, it has increased by about two times), because it can make good use of this decline opportunity to export a large amount and seize foreign markets, there is no harm in terms of international balance of payments. At the same time, the income has increased sharply, and the domestic prices that are about twice as expensive can also be compensated to some extent. Even if it fails to reach the state of trade surplus, it is not enough to affect the livelihood of its people.</p>
<p>However, this large amount of exported goods, sold abroad, should be spread all over the international market, and not just take China as its only outlet. Moreover, China is in a state of low exchange rate and is a silver-using country. Since the trend of expensive gold and cheap silver, the purchasing power has declined, and it is not easy to open up the route of selling at low prices. Who knows that there is a big difference? Because all international countries have adopted tariff protection policies and competed to block the entry of foreign goods. Tariff barriers are layered upon layer, and it is not easy to break through. Even the governments of the United States and the colonies of the South Seas Islands, which used to allow Japanese goods to enter and exit freely, have recently sought ways to resist the continuous import of Japanese goods. Since Japanese goods are blocked everywhere, where is the only way out other than China? The situation in China actually provides great convenience for the entry of Japanese goods: ㈠ China's tariffs cannot be freely determined. Not only does it not have the ability to freely increase taxes to restrict the selling of Japanese goods at low prices, but it also has the product of the one-sided Sino-Japanese tariff reciprocity agreement; ㈡ Although China and Japan are in the same low purchasing power position, because the national industry is not developed, nineteen out of ten daily necessities rely on foreign countries. Even if they consciously vow not to buy Japanese goods, they must suppress their material enjoyment and have no power to change to buy more expensive American goods, British goods, and other goods from other countries. And at the time when the Japanese exchange rate is now low, it is naturally easy to take the place of British and American goods in China and replace them, and it is not difficult to obtain the opportunity to sell well. This is confirmed by the trade situation between China and Japan last year: The trade situation in our country last year can be said to be extremely tragic. On the one hand, exports reached the lowest level, which was the only one after the war, and on the other hand, imports reached the peak, opening up a new record that has not been seen in more than sixty years. At the same time, since April last year, Japan has been blessed by the decline in the exchange rate, and its foreign trade has been smooth. The total export volume for the whole year was 1,370,000,000 and the import volume was 1,293,000,000, which has entered a favorable situation of trade surplus.</p>
<p>Recently, due to the resumption of diplomatic relations with Russia, a part of the foreign goods required in our country has been changed to be purchased from Russia. It has been less than two months since the announcement of the resumption of diplomatic relations, and the import of Russian goods has reached more than 1.4 million taels. Not buying Japanese goods and buying Russian goods is the same in terms of national wealth. What's more, the import of Japanese goods does not decrease due to the import of Russian goods? If these two major foreign goods are allowed to compete for our country's market, the result will always be exhaustion and economic bankruptcy. Therefore, it is predicted that due to the low Japanese exchange rate this year, the import of Japanese goods will be even greater than. The Chinese market really has the ability to reject Japanese goods thousands of miles away, and there is even a shadow over the future of domestic goods. We must not leave the economic principles and think that relying on conscious resistance, empty talk to sell Japanese goods, and not buying Japanese goods can be effective. We should stand on the economic standpoint and consider how to revitalize the strength of national products and thoroughly resist them.</p>
<h3>Several Periods of Sino-Russian Trade</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>Enlightenment Period Since China and Russia are adjacent countries, they have close relations in politics and economics, especially in commerce, which started the earliest. In 137 BC (the second year of Emperor Wu of Han's reign), Emperor Wu of Han ordered Zhang Qian to be sent to the Western Regions. After Zhang Qian opened up the Western Regions, the countries began to communicate with Han. During the reign of Emperor He of the Later Han Dynasty, Ban Chao was sent to conquer the countries of the Western Regions. Later, more than fifty countries in the Western Regions paid tribute and became attached to China, and the trade relationship between China and the Western Regions gradually became closer. At that time, the scope of the Western Regions was very broad, actually including present-day Xinjiang of China, and Kirgiz, Russian Turkestan, and Afghanistan, which now belong to Russia. It can be seen that Sino-Russian trade started in the Han Dynasty and has been more than two thousand years now.</p>
<p>Development Period From the Wei and Jin dynasties to the Sui Dynasty, it can be said that it was the development period of ancient Sino-Russian trade. Because by the Wei and Jin Dynasties, the scope of the Western Regions expanded, merging more than fifty countries in the Han Dynasty into sixteen countries, and its area west of the Pamir Mountains extended to the Russian Caspian Sea and the Black Sea. During the reign of Emperor Yang of the Sui Dynasty, trade between China and the countries of the Western Regions was extremely prosperous. At that time, Zhangye and Wuwei were designated as two inter-markets between the East and the West. There were many merchants from the Western Regions who came and went for business. Closed-Door Period From the middle of the Ming Dynasty to the Opium War of the Qing Dynasty (i.e., 1516-1842), it can be said that it was the period of China's closed-door policy towards foreign trade. Because at that time, the people of Portugal, Spain, Britain, France, and the United States came to China one after another and demanded trade, but our country refused. Russia also took the opportunity to demand land trade. The Chinese side signed the Treaty of Nerchinsk with Russia in the 28th year of Kangxi's reign, allowing it to trade. In the 32nd year of Kangxi's reign, Emperor Shengzu of Qing also stipulated that "Russian merchants can go to Beijing once every three years. Each team is limited to 200 people. They can stay in the Russian Pavilion for 80 days, and trade is tax-free." In the fifth year of Yongzheng's reign (1727), the Treaty of Kyakhta was signed with Russia, and its content was nothing more than Russia's demand for border trade.</p>
<p>Before the War According to the statistics of the Chinese Customs, the number of trade with Russia began in 1867 (the sixth year of Tongzhi's reign). At that time, land trade with Russian Siberia was very developed, worth more than one million customs taels. In the next 20 years, the amount of exports to Russia increased year by year. In 1890, exports to Russia reached 10 million customs taels, but imports from Russia did not improve at all, maintaining a record of 300,000 to 400,000 customs taels per year. Sino-Russian trade was very prosperous before the war. In 1916, trade with Russian Pacific ports was very developed, so the total export value reached 65 million customs taels, while imports also increased to 20 million customs taels.</p>
<p>After the War During the war, the Russian Revolution broke out in 1917. In the next two or three years, it blocked trade with Eastern countries, and China's import and export trade with Russia was only worth 10 to 20 million customs taels. Since 1920, the European War and the Russian Revolution have come to an end, and Sino-Russian trade has also been restored. Especially in 1928, many soybeans, soybean cakes, and other goods were shipped to Russia, and the total export volume reached 88 million customs taels, and imports also reached 20 million customs taels. This was the golden age of Sino-Russian trade. In the recent two or three years, Soviet Russian kerosene and wood have been sold to the Chinese market in large quantities. Especially because its foreign trade is state-owned and planned, the Chinese market has only one way to accommodate it as much as possible. As for whether Chinese goods can be sold well in Russia? The output of soybeans in the Northeast has decreased, and the sales of red and green brick tea to Russia have not been many in recent years. Therefore, the future Sino-Russian trade may be a period of import surplus, and it is difficult to be optimistic!</p>
<h3>Methods for Eliminating Insects in Granaries</h3>
<p>— Song Fu</p>
<p>│Key Points of Granary Construction│</p>
<p>"Accumulate and kill to prevent," were the most important matters in ancient China. However, in modern times, granaries have long been neglected, leading to empty reserves. When sudden disasters occur, people starve and flee, leaving no means of addressing the situation. Hence, there are proposals to restore granaries. Although this matter has not been fully implemented, it is good news for the future of the people's food supply. However, there are many types of edible crops, some of which can be stored for a long time without spoilage, while others are prone to insect infestations after a certain period. Moreover, certain types of insects specifically damage certain crops, sometimes up to thirty or so different kinds. Grain stores, once infested, lose their ability to alleviate famine. Therefore, how to prevent the occurrence of insect pests in granaries, or how to eliminate them, is something that those managing grain storage should pay close attention to. Here, I will describe the methods, also offering them as a reference for the grain industry.</p>
<p>A. Prevention Methods</p>
<p>(1) After the grains are ripe, thresh them immediately, and do not pile them up for too long.</p>
<p>(2) The granary must be very clean. If there is any sign of disease or pests, sulfur must be used to fumigate it. To prevent and kill cicadas, the room must be airtight. All windows and small holes should be sealed with paper strips and kept dry and cool.</p>
<p>(3) Before storage, heat the grains artificially to 125 degrees Fahrenheit for about four to five hours. This will kill all pests. Combined with cleanliness inside the granary, there will be no chance of insect infestation.</p>
<p>(4) Ensure the grain is dry before storing it, to prevent fermentation and deter pests.</p>
<p>B. Elimination Methods</p>
<p>The reproductive capacity of pests is great and rapid. Once they occur, if they are not quickly eliminated, the damage can be unexpectedly severe. (1) Fumigation is the most common method, using chemicals such as hydrocyanic gas, carbon disulfide, and creosote. The procedures to follow before fumigation are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Seal the windows and all openings in the fumigation room with newspaper to prevent air leakage. (2) Measure the length, width, and height of the room to calculate its cubic volume, in order to determine the amount of chemicals to use.</p>
<p>1. Hydrocyanic Gas Fumigation: A. The mixing ratio is as follows: (1) 1 pound of sodium cyanide, (2) 2 pounds of sulfuric acid (concentrated), (3) 2 pounds of water. This formula is suitable for a 1,000 cubic foot room. Adjust the amounts according to the size of the room. B. Procedure: (1) Place several earthenware basins or spittoons in the room, each suitable for holding 1 pound of sodium cyanide. It is better to have too many than too few. Pad the bottom of the basins with newspaper (not necessary for earthen or brick floors). (2) First pour water into the basin, then slowly pour sulfuric acid into it, and stir with a stick (preferably glass). (3) Wrap the sodium cyanide in newspaper (to prevent the poisonous gas from releasing too quickly, endangering people). Place it into the sulfuric acid water. (4) Quickly exit and close the door, sealing the door gaps as well. (5) After three to four hours, or up to five to six hours, open the windows and doors to ventilate the room. Bury the residue in the basins in a place seldom visited. C. Notes: (1) Choose a windless day for fumigation. (2) Choose a day when the temperature is above 70 degrees Fahrenheit for fumigation. (3) Those performing the fumigation must not inhale the poisonous gas. (4) The seeds must be thoroughly dry before fumigation.</p>
<p>2. Carbon Disulfide Fumigation: A. Dosage: For every 1,000 cubic feet of room space, use 10 pounds of carbon disulfide or 10 pounds of sulfur. B. Procedure: (1) When using sulfur, put the sulfur in a smaller basin. (2) Place the sulfur in a large water basin (to prevent the burning sulfur from falling to the ground and causing danger). (3) Place this basin in the room to be fumigated and quickly ignite the sulfur. (4) The person igniting the sulfur should leave immediately. (5) Close the door and seal the external openings of the door. (6) After two to three hours, open the doors and windows to ventilate the room. D. Notes: (1) Remove woolen fabrics and metal objects from the room in advance before fumigating. (2) Be careful of the sulfur sparks igniting other objects and the explosion of carbon disulfide in the air. (3) The sulfur or carbon disulfide basin should be placed high up so that the gas descends. (4) This gas is toxic and should not be inhaled.</p>
<p>3. Poison Gas Fumigation: Poison gas, also known as creosote, is a newly used fumigant. It is superior to carbon disulfide and hydrocyanic gas. A. Dosage: Half a pound of the liquid is sufficient for 1,000 cubic feet of room space. B. Procedure and Usage: There are three uses for this medicine. (1) The "drip-down" method is suitable for large warehouses. First, in a suitable place inside the warehouse, use five or six-foot-long round wood or two or three bamboo poles, angled at 50 degrees, stacked two or three branches on top. Near the top, install a horizontal wooden receiver, which consists of two wooden boards, four or five inches wide and two feet four or five inches long, nailed together. Nail a triangular piece of wood at one end. Drill a small hole every inch on one side of the board. Pour the liquid medicine into this trough. The liquid will flow out of the trough holes, spread down the herbs, and fumigate and kill the pests. The size of the trough depends on the amount of liquid medicine used. (2) Spraying with a sprayer is used for smaller warehouses. (3) Using a flat dish, pour the liquid medicine into a wooden, ceramic, or metal dish, allowing it to gradually evaporate. However, the evaporation power is not strong. A pound of the medicine requires a container with a surface area of more than two square feet to avoid residue. C. Notes: (1) The action time of the liquid medicine is 70 hours, but a little more is harmless. (2) In addition to grains, it can also be used as a fumigant for wild vegetables and fresh fruits. (3) It is harmless to woolen fabrics and metal objects.</p>
<p>(2) Cold and Heat Method: (1) Rapid Cold-Heat Change Method: Make the temperature of the warehouse rapidly rise from 0 degrees Fahrenheit to 50 to 60 degrees Fahrenheit, and then rapidly rise again to a temperature above 100 degrees Fahrenheit. In this way, all the insects in the warehouse will be exterminated. This method is very good for rural areas in winter. (2) High Heat Method: Maintain the warehouse temperature at 125 degrees Fahrenheit to 130 degrees Fahrenheit for a few hours, which also has a great insect-killing power. (3) Low Temperature Method: In severe winter, open the windows wide to allow cold air to enter, which is also effective in killing insects.</p>
<p>(3) Contact Insecticides: The crevices inside the granary harbor insects. The power of fumigation is difficult to reach, and manual cleaning is also difficult. In this case, use camphor oil or phenol, and inject it into the crevices with a brush or sprayer. The insects will die soon after. Afterward, open the doors and windows to ventilate the room.</p>
<p>(4) Sunlight Displacement Method: Lay a two-inch-thick layer of grass and wood ash under direct sunlight. Pile the grain on top of it and expose it to sunlight. The insects will sense the light and heat and move downwards. After about only one hour, remove the top layer, about one inch of grain, and expose the layer below to light and heat, so that the insects gradually descend. Finally, the insects will hide under the ash.</p>
<p>All the above are about insect elimination. In reality, the construction of the food storage building, the duration of food storage, insect and rodent infestations, and the physical and chemical changes of the food are all related.</p>
<h3>Changhua Chicken Blood Stone</h3>
<p>— He Bing</p>
<p>Take a long-distance bus from Hangzhou, and continue along the winding mountain road, passing through Yuhang, Lin'an, and Yuqian counties, to reach Changhua. Changhua borders Anhui and is surrounded by lush mountains. Besides being an important route for transportation between Anhui and Zhejiang, it is an insignificant small county. It has no famous products, nor thriving commerce. Therefore, there is a local saying: the first part is "Wealth doesn't exceed ten thousand," but at the same time, the population is not large, and the land is not very barren. Even without special work, one can go to the mountains to collect a load of wild firewood to sell, hence the second part of the saying is "Poverty doesn't calculate rice."</p>
<p>However, Changhua has one product that makes its name known not only throughout the country, but also overseas. That is Changhua chicken blood stone.</p>
<p>Chicken blood stone is the name of a type of mineral, used for carving, especially for carving seals. It is not produced elsewhere, only in Changhua. Not all places in Changhua County produce it, only the Twelve Capital region, two hundred li away from the county seat, produces it. There is a jade stone cave in Twelve Capital, and only this cave produces chicken blood stone. The cave is completely dark. Anyone can mine chicken blood stone, but each mining operation requires at least fifty yuan worth of dynamite. In the large pieces of raw stone blasted down, it is not certain that any chicken blood stone will be found; there is a 70-80% chance of complete disappointment. If, by good fortune, some chicken blood stone is found, refining work is still required, all of which takes time and money. Even if successfully produced, it is difficult to sell immediately because it is not an essential item. Therefore, small farmers with limited financial resources can only sigh in vain at this Heaven-sent gift that is not forbidden to take. Those who mine chicken blood stone locally are mostly landlords, rich farmers, and merchants. They use fifty or sixty yuan of capital to mine once. If they are lucky, they can earn one or two thousand yuan when they sell it.</p>
<p>"Chicken blood stone" is a general name. Depending on the style, there are also names such as "chicken blood jelly" and "di-color." The best quality stone has red streaks like chicken blood. In reality, the quality is entirely determined by the buyer, and like antiques, there is no fixed standard. The price ranges from a few fen or jiao to several thousand yuan. The buyers are naturally some domestic enthusiasts of books, carvings, and antiques, the so-called literati and refined scholars. The transportation to foreign countries is also extensive, especially to Japanese buyers. The total amount mined in Changhua each year is close to 100,000 yuan. In the past, chicken blood stone could also be used as tribute, for the use of Manchu princes and ministers. Now that business has ended.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>Bond Market Rose Initially, Then Fell Last Week</p>
<p>From February 6th to 11th last week, the public bond market at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was not as active as in the previous week. The environment was dull, and the market gradually entered a peaceful state. Major players, having absorbed enough in the previous week, rarely entered or exited the market last week. Diplomatic issues were still brewing. However, Japan initially advocated peace with the League of Nations, but then, due to clear questioning by the League, disputes arose again. Therefore, the diplomatic situation had become increasingly acute. Before these serious issues were resolved, both buyers and sellers at the exchange were generally cautious. Major players were particularly waiting for the right opportunity, so trading volume was much lower than in the previous week. Market prices were also sluggish as a result. Wednesday and Thursday were the most sluggish days of the week, with the lowest trading volume. On Tuesday and Friday, prices rose and fell, resulting in a draw. On Monday, following the sharp drop on the previous Saturday, prices continued to fall by several jiao to one yuan. However, by the end of last week, market prices had risen by more than one yuan. The results for the week showed inconsistencies compared to the previous week, with some rises and some falls. The range of highs and lows was mostly within half a yuan, which can be described as a peaceful trend. As for trading, scattered transactions by retail investors were more active. Brokers numbered 4, 5, 38, and 40 were among the buyers, while 11, 14, 20, and 32 were among the sellers, but there were no large-scale transactions. Most buying and selling involved swaps. The total turnover for the week was 31,835,000 yuan, including 48,500 yuan in spot transactions. Futures trading was dominated by stamp tax at over 7.75 million yuan, followed by consolidated tax at over 5.5 million yuan, while other transactions were less significant.</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>Overseas Cotton Market Flat and Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was mixed. Prices were initially firm due to optimism about the political situation, but later weakened due to profit-taking by bulls. Futures fell by 4 to 7 points, and spot prices fell by 5 points. UK cotton futures fell by 6 points, and spot prices fell by 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices fell by 11 points. Indian cotton lacked buyers, and bulls took profits. Both Pingguermu, La and Bairoxi fell by one rupee, according to original telegram record (dated 11th).</p>

<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>River Downstream Stagnant Sales, Prices Down 1-2 Jiao</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Sources from the 20th to 30th of the month, about 100 shipments accumulated in Pudong. Urban and rural transactions are quiet, so the market is depressed. Prices of Suzhou, Tongxiang, and Nangang Qingjiao rice are slightly lowered by 1-2 jiao. Only Bo Dao Bao Jie (thin rice bags) slightly moved, still able to hold steady. Du Yangjian rice has some arrivals, affected by Ke Jian (customer-selected rice), and due to the sluggishness of japonica rice, the price followed down by 2 jiao. Yin Bian Yuan rice remains in poor condition. Chang Bang rice has no market for days, reportedly due to boatmen fearing the 6-dou market. Since Shanghai implemented the 5-dou market, local rice coming to Shanghai has been mostly calculated based on the 5-dou market by local merchants. Now, suddenly using the 6-dou market, the local merchants refuse to recognize the loss. Therefore, the boatmen refused to ship causing no market, and the factory goods have not been sold.</p>

The source of Bo Jing Early Rice (thin japonica early rice) was not strong, and sales were average, with prices slightly lowered by one jiao. There were some arrivals of Du Jian rice, but sales were sluggish, and prices fell slightly by nearly a chi. Yang Jian rice had limited arrivals, retail sales were slow, and prices declined slightly by 2 jiao. Ke Jian rice was also weak, declining by nearly a chi. Yin Yuan rice fell by 2-3 jiao, and Bai Bian Yuan rice fell by another 3 jiao.</p>

<h3>Hardware</h3>
<p>The Military Procured Hardware Yesterday</p>
<p>Although hardware trading was not very active yesterday, the military procured a large batch of hardware, totaling over 4,000 dan. For example, 400-500 barrels of #2 white lead skin were purchased, over 1,000 dan of new lead wire, 500 dan of thick tinplate, and other items like black iron sheet, green lead, and red copper were also traded. After the military procurement, the market for various items improved significantly, and prices showed an upward trend. For example, #2 lead skin can be valued at 27 taels, new lead wire at 11 taels 2 qian 5 fen, tinplate at 26 taels, black iron sheet at 8 taels 5 qian, green lead at 12 taels, and red copper at 35 taels.</p>
<p>It was widely rumored in the market yesterday that a large batch of hardware would arrive in Shanghai today or tomorrow, to be unloaded at the New Taikoo and Gonghexiang wharves and warehouses.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea</h3>
<p>No Sign of a Turnaround in the Silk Market Last Week</p>
<p>European and American Silk Prices are Low, Chinese Silk Bears Heavy Losses.</p>
<p>Current Silk Sales are Sluggish, Few Silk Factories Have Resumed Production.</p>
<p>The local foreign silk market showed no progress last week. Overseas markets are flooded with Japanese silk, and Japanese merchants continue to offer low prices, making it difficult for Chinese silk prices to rise. Last week, New York quotes for newly spun Japanese silk for delivery in May and June were still only $1.13-1.14 per pound in gold. Sales of Bai Chang Jing and other factories were sluggish. Silk weaving factories in Lyon, in view of the changing silk market, are following a "buy as needed" policy, and the silk market has not seen new developments. Shanghai Chinese silk merchants, having received news from overseas that silk prices are too low and incurring heavy losses, are holding firm and not making any moves. Only five or six silk factories in Shanghai, including Jardine Matheson, have resumed production, and the prospects for the silk market are increasingly pessimistic. Although overseas Chinese silk prices rose due to exchange rate fluctuations last week, adjusted for the actual price, prices are still falling rather than rising. As a result, only over 100 bales of current silk were traded during the week, and over 300 bales were exported. The following is a table of Chinese silk prices in European and American markets at the end of last week (New York prices per pound in gold dollars, Lyon prices per hectogram in francs):</p>

<h3>Vagrant (3)</h3>
<p>— Jia</p>
<p>Damn it! I hate this heaven, it always torments us poor people! It blew a strong wind for half a day, which made people's skin ache all over, and then it started to snow. I kept running forward, and the snowflakes kept chasing me. I didn't run far before my blood-soaked sackcloth was covered with cotton wool. But this cotton wool is different from others, it doesn't have a bit of warmth, but it makes me shiver. I can't wait to get to the teahouse to buy some evening tea. This weather is really unbearable!</p>
<p>A person came running towards me, bumping into me breathlessly, almost knocking me head over heels. I was about to scold him when he greeted me.</p>
<p>"Hey! Sanniu, what are you doing out here in this snow?"</p>
<p>I looked and saw that it was Wang Xiaoliuzi, who buys evening tea with me at the stove. I couldn't help but force out a smile and replied, "Am I not allowed to come out to make some money?"</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoliuzi was covered in snow wool like me, except for the fur patch stuck on his head, which was a brand-new rabbit fur piece, looking like it was worth at least one or two inches of silver. I don't know where he got it. As I looked at it, I became envious.</p>
<p>Wang Xiaoliuzi had already seen through my thoughts. He reached out and tore off the fur patch and said to me, "I got this from the pawnshop. Look, is it any good?"</p>
<p>I had nothing to say. My hand unconsciously reached up and touched the back of my head, touching a handful of snow. Hey! That's terrible! I have to get a fur patch to wave around too. In this snowy weather, the snow falls on the roots of the hair and is blown into ice by the wind, which is really suffering! I pushed Wang Xiaoliuzi away and ran.</p>
<p>The snow was still falling, and I had shrunk into a dark alley. Outside the alley was the tram stop. The tram wheels dinged and stopped there. I pushed for a long time, wanting to find an opportunity to strike, but somehow, all the glass windows were tightly closed, and I couldn't make any money. Finally, I waited for one with open windows. A local was sticking his head out, and on his head was a fur patch. As soon as I saw it, the little deer in my heart jumped with joy. Not caring about the quality of the fur patch, I ran out of the alley in one stride, ran to the tram, and with one hand, tore the fur patch off the local's head. The local only shouted inside the carriage, and the tram dinged and drove away. I almost laughed my chin off. I tried to stick the fur patch on my forehead, and it fit perfectly. I shrank back into the dark alley. In the alley, I don't know when a beggar came, unbuttoning his pants to pee. At his feet was a reed mat, a ham, looking like he was delivering New Year's gifts. Ha! You're sending New Year's gifts, but it would be better to give them to me. I was honest and didn't stand on ceremony. I reached out and grabbed it and left. The beggar shouted, "Hey! Hey!" I don't know what he was saying. Thanks to his pee, he tripped and I got away with it.</p>
<p>I'm really lucky today! Everywhere I go, I find money. Everywhere I go, I can make money. With one hand carrying the reed mat and ham, and the other hand touching the five silver coins in my blood-soaked sackcloth, I couldn't help but hum "Crying Seven Sevens."</p>
<p>"The first seven days have arrived, crying sadly, holding a red quilt to cover it up..." (The End)</p>
<h3>Strategic Relationship</h3>
<p>— He Jiagan</p>
<p>The National Salvation Daily of the capital has a famous saying:</p>
<p>"Even if it is for a strategic relationship, we must temporarily abandon Beiping in order to lure the enemy deep... Zhang Xueliang should be severely ordered to use force to stop the opposition movement, even if it means bloodshed." (See Shanghai Daily, February 9th reprint).</p>
<p>Even if it means bloodshed! How brave, strategic masters!</p>
<p>Indeed, a lot of blood has been shed, even more is being shed, and no one knows how much more will be shed. All this is the blood of the opposition movement. Why? For the sake of strategic relations.</p>
<p>When the strategists were fighting in Shanghai, they said, 'For the sake of strategic relations, retreat to the second line of defense.' And so they retreated. Two days later, they said, 'For the sake of strategic relations, if the Japanese army does not shoot at our army, then our army must not open fire, and the soldiers must all obey.' And so they ceased fire. After that, the 'second line of defense' disappeared, the Shanghai peace talks began, negotiations, signing, conclusion. At that time, presumably for the sake of strategic relations, blood was also seen? This is a military secret, which ordinary people cannot know—as for those who have bled themselves, although they know, they no longer have tongues. After all, why didn't the enemy 'be lured deep' at that time?</p>
<p>Now we know: the reason why the enemy was not 'lured deep' that time was definitely not because the strategist's means were too clumsy, nor was it entirely due to the 'too little' blood shed by the opposition movement; but there was another reason: Britain mediated—secretly reaching an understanding with Japan, saying, Japan, your troops should temporarily withdraw from Shanghai, and we Britain will further help you so that Manchuguo will not be denied by the League of Nations—this is now the League of Nations' so-and-so draft, the attitude of the so-and-so committee. In fact, this is saying, you should not go deep here—there are spoils to be divided—you should first go deep to the north. Going deep is still going to be deep, but the location is temporarily different.</p>
<p>Therefore, the strategy of 'luring the enemy deep into Beiping' is now needed. Naturally, blood will have to be shed a few more times.</p>
<p>In fact, everything is now ready, the capital and the auxiliary capital are complete in every respect, and cultural relics, and college students, have also moved. Whether it is yellow-faced, white-faced, New World, or Old World enemies, no matter where these enemies want to go deep, please go deep. As for fearing any opposition movement, our strategists...'even if it means bloodshed!' Rest assured, rest assured.</p>
<h3>People Who Hope for the Arrival of the True Son of Heaven</h3>
<p>— Qifan</p>
<p>If I say that you are hoping for the appearance of the true son of heaven, you will definitely not admit it and will consider me to be insulting you. You believe that this feudal thought has been completely swept away, and you can still guarantee that no one now hopes for the appearance of an emperor.</p>
<p>But is that the case? In many parts of China, there are indeed many people who still long for the true son of heaven. Didn't the Public Security Bureau of Shandong arrest an emperor and empress two months ago? And there are indeed many people who hope that when the true son of heaven comes out, the world will be peaceful, and they blame the current chaos on the lack of a true son of heaven. In their minds, the true son of heaven is a benefactor who saves the people from fire and water, and all difficulties and hardships can be resolved. As long as the true son of heaven comes, all the people can immediately be happy, so in this year of frequent disasters, the idea of having a true son of heaven has become more difficult to eliminate.</p>
<p>So, you also have the idea of hoping for world peace, social stability, and people's harmony, right? You also have the idea of hoping for a stable life and career development, right? And you also sympathize with the hope of having no corrupt officials and no exorbitant taxes, right? You also hope to have legal rights that are not violated and the proper protection of life and property, right? That's for sure, you also hope for the progress, upward development, prosperity, and development of this country, this nation, and this society.</p>
<p>However, may I ask, for this purpose, how have you ever struggled? What efforts have you ever made that you can talk about?</p>
<p>I'm very sorry, you haven't. Then you are really not as good as the people who hope for the arrival of the true son of heaven. Without effort or struggle, you want to get all the peace and happiness. Isn't that the same as them wanting to rely on the appearance of the true son of heaven to get all the peace and happiness? They still don't know how to seek happiness, and only think that they can get happiness if there is a true son of heaven, but you know that the true son of heaven is unreliable.</p>
<p>It is somewhat excusable for people who do not know that they must take another path besides the true son of heaven to achieve happiness; but those who know that the true son of heaven is unreliable, but are unwilling to make their own efforts to find a way out and follow the right path, and sit and wait for happiness to fall from the sky, is that not too stupid and too lazy? It is very clear that happiness will not fall from the sky for no reason, and it is also obvious that it will not slip out of the hands of those who grasp it, so what are you waiting for blankly? In the end, aren't you still like them, waiting for the true son of heaven, national hero, genius, and master to come out, work hard for them, fight their way through a bloody path, save the people from the depths of misery, and give them happiness.</p>
<p>It is naturally the peak of laziness to not want to move yourself and hope that others will do it. It is certainly a good way to wait for the true son of heaven, national hero, genius, and master to replace us in suffering and working hard, but what if they don't come? Moreover, after they come, will they really be able to satisfy us? No one can guarantee this. All the true sons of heaven, national heroes, geniuses, and masters are the same. After they have gained a position, the people will still have to ask for a second batch of true sons of heaven, national heroes, geniuses, and masters.</p>
<p>People who hope for the arrival of the true son of heaven should abandon this hope. People who know that there cannot be a true son of heaven should also stop waiting for the rise of heroes and geniuses, and should think of ways to make their own efforts. It is a lazy idea to want the true son of heaven, to think of heroes and geniuses to save us and work hard to open up a broad road for us. We must remove this laziness from our lives in order to find a way out. You don't want the true son of heaven to come, that's for sure. You must also make your own efforts and inspire others to stop hoping for the true son of heaven or heroes and geniuses.</p>

<h3>Crossroads of the Times and Love (Continued Draft 26)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Ziping</p>
<p>"Where should I go at this moment?"</p>
<p>He saw a streetcar coming and realized that he had not yet decided on his destination. Going to school was of course impossible, because he had not brought a book or a notebook. Going to Ren Shuo's house was too early, and it was not an appropriate place, because his spirit was still somewhat excited at the moment, and he could not calm down. Walking to Ren's house panting was too embarrassing.</p>
<p>He was thinking, and the streetcar drove away again.</p>
<p>"That's right, there's a way to go, go to Old Cao's house..."</p>
<p>He decided to take the streetcar and then walk another third of a mile east to Z intersection to take a public bus. He walked to Z intersection and saw a public bus just leaving, so he had to stand under the utility pole and wait for the second public bus.</p>
<p>"Ah! Mr. Zhu!"</p>
<p>He suddenly saw Zhu Weidao, a professor of arts at the school, dozing off against the utility pole, and called out. Mr. Zhu was not the top teacher in his class, he only taught two hours of English, which was an elective course for them.</p>
<p>"Ah, Mr. Lin!"</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu was wearing a double-breasted black wool coat, with a black leather bag under his arm. Hearing someone call him, he quickly opened his tired eyes and looked at Haiquan.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu, are you going to class?"</p>
<p>"Sigh, it's really annoying!..."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu said half a sentence and then coughed for a while. He did not rush to speak, but reached into his coat pocket and took out a pack of chewing gum.</p>
<p>He pulled out a piece and put it in his mouth.</p>
<p>"Do you want one?" Mr. Zhu, with the chewing gum in his mouth, brought the pack to Haiquan's mouth.</p>
<p>"What kind of candy?"</p>
<p>Haiquan also pulled out a piece from Mr. Zhu's hand, but did not rush to put it in his mouth.</p>
<p>"Chewing Gum"</p>
<p>"Chewing Gum"</p>
<p>Because he had never eaten this kind of chewing gum, he showed a suspicious look on his face.</p>
<p>"Chewing gum, good for freshening your breath,"</p>
<p>Haiquan tasted it and found it interesting.</p>
<p>"Where can I buy it, Mr. Zhu?"</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu grabbed his mouth and stretched his chin to the opposite side. Haiquan saw a candy store run by the Japanese and Russians across the street. He thought, Cao Shiguang has children, I should buy a few packs of chewing gum to take to them as gifts. The public bus had not yet arrived, so he went over and bought six packs, then returned to the utility pole and chatted with Mr. Zhu.</p>
<p>"Mr. Zhu, do you have class so early?"</p>
<h3>Bizarre Articles for Shared Appreciation</h3>
<p>— Zhou Jingchai</p>
<p>The great men and gentlemen regard the "ancient relics of the Forbidden City" as precious as their lives (of course, not the lives of ordinary people), and are determined to move them south, simply because the value of the "ancient relics" is more than "priceless", and they are easy to move and easy to turn into money. Is it worth it for you to be so surprised and make sarcastic remarks! Just as I was thinking this, I actually saw an editorial in a capital newspaper supporting the "southward relocation of ancient relics"; and suggesting "stopping the opposition with force" and "not hesitating to shed blood", requesting the government to "maintain its prestige" and "implement its policies"! I really couldn't bear to let such grand words and lofty arguments be lost and unknown, so I took the trouble to transcribe them and offer them to the public.</p>
<p>"...The opposition of various organizations in Beiping to the southward relocation of ancient relics is harmful to the future prosperity of Beiping. The reason for this selfish and self-serving complete disregard for national interests is actually said by various organizations in Beiping. We admire their thick-skinned shamelessness. They only care about the prosperity of Beiping. It is inevitable that they are too narrow-minded. If the government, for the sake of strategic relations, must temporarily abandon Beiping in order to lure the enemy deep and encircle and annihilate them, then the ancient relics will inevitably be plundered by the enemy. May I ask, how can the future prosperity of Beiping be maintained? Therefore, it is better to relocate them first. After defeating Japan and Beiping is as safe as Mount Tai, then relocate them back. The selfishness and self-interest of various organizations in Beiping is certainly hateful and shameful. Their lack of foresight is also pitiful. Another reason for their opposition to the relocation is that the government should first take care of the land. Their words seem right but are actually wrong. Abandoning a part of the land for the enemy to occupy in order to annihilate the enemy and then recover it is a very common example throughout history, both in ancient and modern times, both in China and abroad. Such as in the campaign of 1812, the Russians not only abandoned Moscow, but also burned Moscow to trap Napoleon. During the European War, Belgium and Serbia both abandoned their entire territories for the enemy to trample on, and then defeated the strong Germany. Land that is occupied only needs to not negotiate with the enemy and sign a treaty of cession, then the enemy will have no way to deal with the land. As for the ancient relics of the Forbidden City, if they are not relocated and Beiping is unfortunately occupied by the enemy, the ancient relics will be plundered and taken away. May I ask, what method will China use to recover them? It will be seen that the crystallization of Chinese civilization will be used as the enemy's spoils of war. What could be more shameful?...Finally, we would like to tell the government that the government's policy of relocating ancient relics has already been decided, so no matter what obstacles are encountered, it should seek to implement it. If it is stopped because of the opposition of a group of ignorant and shortsighted fools, where will the government's prestige be? Therefore, we advocate severely ordering Zhang Xueliang to use force to stop the opposition movement. If necessary, we will not hesitate to shed blood..."</p>

<h3>Watching a Fire and Other Things</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>The Chinese often have a kind of schadenfreude mentality. This can be proven by many things. For example, when a certain jewelry store on Great Horse Road caught fire last year, the parties involved certainly had unspeakable sadness, but the people watching the fire had a kind of indescribable happiness. The reason is very simple, because it was someone else's house that was burning, and it was someone else's property that was being lost. Therefore, it doesn't matter. I am happy to "watch the fire from across the street." So everyone shouted to their children:</p>
<p>"Everyone come and see, it's so beautiful, the Great Horse Road is on fire!"</p>
<p>Regardless of whether the fire would spread throughout Great Horse Road, regardless of whether it would spread to their own homes, they still had to enjoy themselves when the fire was at its fiercest and most beautiful, because this was a rare opportunity, worth enjoying, worth laughing at.</p>
<p>Secondly, let's talk about watching people being killed. Ada heard that criminals were going to be executed in a certain place, and thought, "Killing people? Ah! What a beautiful scene that must be! A knife aimed at the neck, and then blood, blood, bright red blood spurting out, beautiful, beautiful!" Immediately, he fully and dutifully spread the word everywhere.</p>
<p>"Go, go, go watch the killing, it's so beautiful, smack..."</p>
<p>So A-Er knew and wanted to go watch, and A-San and A-Si also knew and wanted to go watch. Everyone went to watch in order to watch others being killed, people who were not related to them, regardless of whether their own necks would be slashed in the same way in the future.</p>
<p>Thirdly, like the "autumn maneuvers" in Shandong and the all-out martial arts performance of "taking Chengdu" in Sichuan not long ago, in our opinion, they were also quite interesting. Although people from afar might not be able to see them with their own eyes as clearly as watching "the fire on Great Horse Road", reading in the newspaper that a certain army charged three times, with countless casualties, and that a certain army made a large encirclement and captured thousands of weapons, was not without interest. Of course, they are fighting, they are dying, what does it have to do with me? Naturally, there is no need to oppose it. If a fight breaks out here too, it won't be too late to escape then. Besides, someone is already advocating abolition, and isn't the world going to be peaceful soon?</p>
<p>Also, Japan's imperialism has attacked Shenyang, but it doesn't matter, because it's outside the pass, and it has nothing to do with us southerners. The Japanese soldiers bloodbathed Zhabei, but it doesn't matter, because it's in the Chinese area, and it has nothing to do with us who live in the concession. Now they have occupied Yuguan and are attacking Pingjin, but it doesn't matter, because it's in the north, and it has nothing to do with us who live in Shanghai. So everyone is at peace of mind. Anyway, it's them who are dying, it's their houses that are burning, and it's their wives and daughters who are being raped, what does it have to do with me? Besides, they have invented the most meaningful "long-term resistance," which is even more self-satisfying. So tea dances are held several times, entertainment is done several times, saving the country through entertainment, killing two birds with one stone, both saving the country and having fun. What could be better? If you feel a little guilty, you might as well send a few more telegrams to the League of Nations to correct the record and uphold justice. The foreign gentlemen (Gentlemen) are bound to be busy, once with a "council" and twice with a "group." So we have even more confidence. Since someone is making an effort, why should we bother ourselves? Even if someone insists on doing it themselves, we might as well try our best to calm them down or slap them in the face without ceremony, and talk about it later. If the robbers form a gang, we must first "pacify the interior" before resisting foreign aggression, besides, is China really going to be divided?</p>
<p>Watching the fire from across the river, how happy. The Chinese often have a kind of schadenfreude mentality.</p>

<h3>Terror Memories</h3>
<p>— A Kui</p>
<p>Recently, the call to save the country through aviation has become increasingly loud, which can't help but remind me of the terror of last year!</p>
<p>"Can't sleep yourself, and you're making noise early in the morning?" Old Wang heard the "boom boom" sound; thinking that it was the physical education instructor using a basketball to hit the door again, so he shouted loudly, but there was no reply from outside, and the sound stopped.</p>
<p>"Why is the sound of the plane so loud today?" Old Wang said again.</p>
<p>Behind our school is an aviation school, and they have to do morning exercises every morning. But today the sound was particularly loud, and it was coming from far away, getting louder and denser.</p>
<p>The "boom boom" sound came again, and Old Wang thought it was the physical education instructor again? So he walked out angrily to open the door. There was no one outside. Suddenly, Old Wang shouted, "Come and see! Today they are doing big maneuvers, the planes are lined up very beautifully."</p>
<p>We Xia, Fang, and I jumped out of the quilt and went to the door to see. The sharp-eyed Xia shouted early, "This is a Japanese plane! Isn't there a red sun on the wing?"</p>
<p>Cowardly me immediately suggested going into the bedroom, so as not to be seen by the enemy and get bombed. Everyone shrank into the bedroom, the door closed tightly, looking out from the glass window; the plane was just circling around our school, but suddenly it went backwards again. It turned out that they had discovered the wrong target, and at the same time, one or two rifle shots were heard behind.</p>
<p>The academic affairs office knew and immediately ordered the students to escape. So everyone took their cash, the female students cried in panic, and the teacher just shouted to leave quickly, as if our school would be bombed immediately.</p>
<p>The plane was flying lower and lower, and even the people sitting on it could be seen very clearly. So low, what should we do? If we don't escape, we will be bombed to death. So regardless of everything, we ran towards West Mountain like a swarm of bees.</p>
<p>The sentry in the aviation school shouted loudly, "Disperse!" So everyone remembered the danger of gathering in a large group. It was ridiculous to say that after two years of military training, they had forgotten even this bit of military knowledge in the panic? The planes in the aviation school did not have time to take off, so they were destroyed by the bombs. Later, the people in the aviation school said that fortunately the enemy discovered the wrong target. Otherwise, our silkworm school would have been bombed.</p>
<p>Although this happened at the end of last year, now Rehe and other places are also suffering such slaughter and bombing. But, after all, the people of Shanghai are blessed? (At least in the eyes of most people) If a plane comes, run to the concession. But, hum! Looking at the attitude of the great powers, one day we will taste this taste in the concession too? Which country is really helping?</p>
<h3>Images Entering the City God Temple</h3>
<p>— Qun</p>
<p>│Seeking Help From Others is Not as Good as Seeking It From Yourself</p>
<p>It's not that I'm a country bumpkin coming to Shanghai for the first time, nor is it that a child wants to buy a carousel lantern for the Lantern Festival; it's just that I took the convenient route through the City God Temple to see a friend in Ximen (New North Gate).</p>
<p>The Rainbow Temple on Nanjing Road, many people consider a regret of the British Concession, the reason being that it obstructs the view of the bourgeoisie, but our City God Temple is much more beautiful. It has a grand main hall, cement architecture, and a post-fire renovation that evokes a similar feeling to the Western architecture by West Lake. The renovated facade of the City God Temple has unexpectedly led to a booming business, like getting one free with a purchase. Old women with yellow cloth bags going on pilgrimages, fashionable young ladies in high heels and long cheongsams, well-behaved gentlemen in melon-cap and mandarin jackets... as I entered the temple gate, all kinds of different people crowded around the incense and candle stalls, obediently offering a few pennies, and the beggars could effortlessly stretch out their hands, as copper coins seemed to fall from the sky into their bags.</p>
<p>Passing through the open-air food stalls, I ascended to the Grand Hall. The incense workers put the received incense, candles, and silver ingots into their bamboo baskets, and then the old women, fashionable young ladies, and well-behaved gentlemen, disregarding their noble knees, knelt and kowtowed... The old women mumbled incantations, hoping for a long life of a hundred years, their sons' promotion and fortune, their daughters-in-law to be virtuous and respectful, and their chubby grandchildren to overcome obstacles. The fashionable young ladies blushed first, smiled slightly, and the two famous dimples on the sea also made the sincerely efficacious deity lower its head as if afraid of being seduced. The young ladies gracefully moved their cherry lips, secretly praying that "my beloved won't patronize prostitutes, won't rent small houses, and won't have affairs," adhering to the Three No's principle. The well-behaved gentlemen carefully straightened their robes and knelt, hoping for a surplus in the store's annual income, for the young masters to be dissolute and ignorant of the store's affairs, so they could manipulate things as they pleased, and after marrying a wife and building a house in the coming year, they would consecrate the deity...</p>
<p>A few copper coins, holding such great hopes. Life in this world is nothing more than fame and fortune. But as the saying goes, "For fame and fortune, seeking help from others is not as good as seeking it from yourself." Seeking help from others is already not as good as seeking it from yourself, and now they are even using incense, candles, and silver ingots to seek help from wooden and clay idols. This kind of one-capital, ten-thousand-profit gamble completely exposes the weaknesses of the Chinese people.</p>
<p>On a larger scale, extending to national affairs, look at the Mukden Incident of September 18th, the tragic events in Zhabei, Shanghai, and then the loss of the First Pass Under Heaven amidst congratulatory sounds. One side is advancing step by step, while the other relies on the League of Nations puppets, which are like wooden and clay idols. The result is no different from going home after burning incense, candles, and silver ingots, still facing illness and death.</p>
<p>The bourgeois people think the Rainbow Temple is a regret of the British Concession, and we, the oppressed people, should also be alert that the City God Temple is our weakness; let us use our fists to give imperialism a warning.</p>
<p>Our slogan: "Seeking help from others is not as good as seeking it from yourself."</p>
<h3>The Son of a Rickshaw Puller: A Question</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>I have some friends who like to go to teahouses for tea. When I ask them why they don't buy tea leaves and drink at home, their reason is: "The teahouse is like a miniature society. Scholars who study sociology can easily frequent teahouses without having to run around. As for listening to tall tales, that's missing the real flavor of drinking tea." Persuaded by their humorous answer, I also went to teahouses for a few days and surprisingly heard many things that were better than seeing with my own eyes, questions worth discussing: the son of a rickshaw puller is one of them.</p>
<p>There was an old man wearing glasses who chatted endlessly with familiar tea drinkers every day. According to my friend, he used to be a lawyer. One day, he said: He has a small house near Lujiabang, which he rented to a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei. There were three people in their family: the husband, the wife, and their son. The man pulled the rickshaw every day, and the woman set up a stall at the door selling sweets and toys for children. They lived a peaceful life. Their son was exceptionally clever. Parents all over the world have the same heart; they either hope their son will be promoted and become wealthy, bringing honor to their ancestors, or they hope he will marry, have children, and establish a career. Seeing their son's intelligence, they thought pulling a rickshaw was not a good profession after all, so they sent their son to school to study from a young age. They never thought about what kind of profession he could change to after studying. They simply thought that knowing a few words would at least be better than the hard work of pulling a rickshaw. In this way, they unexpectedly nurtured their son until he graduated from junior high school. The old couple wanted him to finish high school, but the tuition and book fees were too high, so they gave up. Thus, the difficult question of finding a profession was placed before them. From the perspective of rickshaw pullers,</p>
<p>graduating from junior high school meant having abundant knowledge (the old lawyer said here, unable to suppress his emotions), but in reality, there were countless middle school graduates sitting in small rooms waiting for hard bread! The old couple had no relatives to rely on, so they had no choice but to ask their junior high school son to condescend to their humble stall. Unexpectedly, their son, who had acquired a bit of foreign airs, thought that this kind of thing would embarrass him as a middle school student. His father said a few words to him, and he stole money from home, bought foreign clothes, and ran away...</p>
<p>The story need not be continued here. "Nothing in the world is as difficult as eating," the author himself has deeply felt since graduation. Pulling a rickshaw, of course, is not as good as being an official... as well as pulling a rickshaw, but people's desires are endless. Seeing that their life was peaceful, the couple used their hard-earned money to educate their son (the author does not want readers to misunderstand that he is against studying), but the result had an unexpected effect. I think this is a very serious problem. I wonder what the editor and readers think?</p>

<h3>The Authority of Law</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Cheng, joined the Sichuan Road × Woolen and Sundries Store as a shareholder the year before last out of consideration for relationships. Judging from the business situation, it could barely sustain itself even during peacetime. Unexpectedly, the Shanghai War broke out last year, and as a result, it could not officially operate for more than four months; and the daily expenses of more than fifty yuan could not be reduced by even a penny. As a result, at the end of the year, the account showed a loss of more than five thousand yuan. The manager, Mr. Gu, then convened a shareholders' meeting this spring, resolving that each share would be padded with another one thousand yuan to continue maintaining the business; if anyone refused to pad the money, their shares would be forfeited. At this time of social and economic exhaustion, Mr. Cheng no longer has the ability to pad the money in his business; but if he does not pad the money, then the half-share capital he previously paid, totaling one thousand yuan, will be subject to the "forfeiture" punishment. He sighs all day long and cannot think of a good way to deal with it. Yesterday, he came to me, not abandoning me, to ask for advice: but I, with my meager knowledge, also feel helpless. I dare to write a letter to</p>
<p>you, sir, to ask you to answer this question. If this leads to a good result, then it would not only be Mr. Cheng's good fortune, but I would also feel the same way. Respectfully, I wish you</p>
<p>peace. Sincerely, Lin Xianzhao</p>
<p>× × ×</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Nowadays, there is a group of people who have adopted the slogan "the minority obeys the majority," disregarding the authority of the law and acting recklessly at every turn. This is indeed very common. Therefore, we are specifically discussing "the effectiveness of resolutions" and "the authority of the law" publicly below: hoping that people with this inaccurate concept will quickly wake up.</p>
<p>We must know that any resolution of a meeting naturally has great freedom within the scope of the law: but once its nature conflicts with the "law," then this resolution cannot take effect. Therefore, even the highest national parliament, if its resolution violates the spirit of the constitution, then this resolution is not effective. How much less a mere shareholders' meeting? From this, we can know that the question asked in Mr. Lin's letter can disregard the resolution of the shareholders' meeting and focus on the law.</p>
<p>This woolen and sundries store has only been open for two years. In the first year, the Shanghai War had not yet broken out, so there would naturally not be much loss: in the second year, according to the letter, it lost more than five thousand yuan. Unfortunately, because the letter did not specify the total amount of capital, we cannot estimate the exact amount that Mr. Cheng should be responsible for; but it can also be known that it will certainly not exceed one thousand yuan. In other words, Mr. Cheng naturally still has a share of the store's remaining assets. Now that the store is losing money, unless the original share certificate stipulates otherwise, "shares are not allowed to be converted into cash within a few years," Mr. Cheng can naturally propose to withdraw his shares. After withdrawing his shares, Mr. Cheng's share of the remaining capital can naturally be demanded for return. If the manager or other shareholders actually confiscate it according to the resolution, this is their infringement of rights. Mr. Cheng can sue according to the law, and the court will certainly not disregard Mr. Cheng's legal interests because of the shareholders' meeting resolution.</p>
<p>As for the method of calculating the remaining capital, it can be based on last year's "red ledger." But if they deliberately leave room for maneuver, deliberately devaluing the productive goods, or there are other untrue places, Mr. Cheng can still claim a review? Legal interests will never be shaken by their resolutions.</p>

<h3>A Family of Scholars (Continuation 18)</h3>
<p>— Wang Zhongxian</p>
<p>"Wife, do you have social engagements again today?"</p>
<p>"It's all to save you that I made acquaintances with many wealthy people's wives. Today, Mrs. Mo is hosting a dinner party. Mr. Mo is the one who telegraphed to bail you out. How can I not attend?"</p>
<p>"It's not that I don't allow you to go out, but you should also pity me a little! I am now a disabled person. Everything requires someone to serve and help. The maids are not very considerate in their work. I don't want to order them around; although Miss (Daughter) is willing to serve me considerately, she is getting old, and there are many inconveniences. I don't dare to order her around too much. It's best if you go out to social events less often and stay at home to keep me company. If you tell people about this difficult situation, they will forgive you."</p>
<p>Mrs. Ruohua rolled her eyes and said, "You're paralyzed in bed! Do you want others to be paralyzed with you? That's really bad luck!"</p>
<p>"You and I are husband and wife..."</p>
<p>She hurriedly interrupted, saying, "You are an old man, and I am an old woman. What's with all the mushy talk? You are sick, it's not my fault. I'm willing to be sick for you. Transfer the sickness to me, and I'm willing to lie down every day. I definitely don't want you to serve me. I'll let you go out every day, whether it's to drink with prostitutes or visit meat shops. I definitely won't interfere with you. One should always live freely and beautifully. Why are you so narrow-minded? You're not a breastfeeding child, clinging to me every moment, what for?"</p>
<p>Just as Zhongnan was about to say something to her, she had already flown away like a startled swan. Zhongnan could only sigh and watch her leave. Coincidentally, Youzhong arrived and saw his brother's brows furrowed, looking very unhappy. He asked him what was wrong, and Zhongnan shook his head and sighed repeatedly, saying:</p>
<p>"Misfortune in the family!"</p>
<p>Youzhong pressed him to tell him what misfortune, so he asked:</p>
<p>"Your sister-in-law and I have been separated for more than a year. Recently, her attitude has changed greatly. I suspect she may have engaged in improper behavior. You often come to my house, have you heard any rumors?"</p>
<p>Hearing this, Youzhong couldn't help but turn red in the face, stammering and answering:</p>
<p>"Probably not!"</p>
<p>"Your face is flushed, and you hesitated for a long time before answering a single sentence," probably you know something but are unwilling to say it. In fact, you can tell me everything. As the saying goes, "Brothers are like hands and feet, wives are like clothes." You and I are hands and feet, would you still help her deceive me?"</p>
<p>Youzhong was truly ashamed in his heart, lowering his head and not daring to look at his brother's face. Zhongnan saw this and became even more suspicious, pressing him to ask:</p>
<p>"I know, you are afraid of hurting the harmony between us husband and wife, so you are unwilling to tell the truth. In fact, even if you tell me, I won't make things difficult for her. I am a person who cares very much about face, and I would never publicize this dishonorable matter. Moreover, I am half-dead already, can I still separate from her? If you tell me, I will only warn her to quickly change her ways and stop associating with people, and that will be the end of it. Tell me!"</p>
<p>At this time, Youzhong wished he could find a hole in the ground to crawl into. He lowered his head and was only thinking about making up a lie. Unable to withstand Zhongnan's repeated urging, he was forced to say:</p>
<p>"I don't suspect anyone else, it's just that young man named Zheng. According to your sister-in-law, he is her nephew, and he often moves in and out of the house. I don't know about other people."</p>
<p>"That's Zheng Jiping, I know he is indeed her sister's son. He's only seventeen years old this year, it can't be him. He often comes to my house, and I often see him. He intends to marry Daiqiu as his wife. Ruohua and I have discussed it, and Ruohua is willing, but Daiqiu herself is still not very willing. This child is very well-behaved, you are mistaken!" Youzhong's heart skipped a beat upon hearing this. He didn't yet know that this young man named Zheng was pursuing Daiqiu. Zhongnan didn't find out who his rival in love was, but Youzhong found out a rival in love for himself. At this time, Daiqiu gracefully walked in. Youzhong had a chance to escape, claiming he had something to do and excused himself. He went straight to the small house to see Ruohua. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Road to Life" (Original Title: Road to Life)</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>The Soviet film "Road to Life" was screened yesterday at the Shanghai Grand Theater. Because I am an executive news reporter, I was also fortunate enough to be able to visit. As I walked out of the theater, I deeply felt a new revelation. How vivid and powerful the story of this script is! There is no romance, no women's legs, and no gentlemen's top hats or evening dresses. On the contrary, it has strong and joyful crowds, and the radiant and brilliant vitality of youth.</p>
<p>The theme of this film is so great. A group of homeless children who were displaced by the devastation of the First World War, in order to struggle in hunger and cold, in order to live, had to engage in theft, robbery, and even murder. Undoubtedly, this is not a question of conscience or morality, but a serious economic problem. Thus, in the hard work of the Five-Year Plan, this group of homeless children also became socialist builders under the guidance of patient and well-intentioned education. But in the process of their efforts, they encountered many serious obstacles, but because they had a firm and decisive spirit and a clear understanding, they finally achieved success after several sacrifices.</p>
<p>Of course, this is a film with a great educational mission, a work of the masses themselves.</p>
<p>As for the performance techniques, there is also the greatest success. The director shows a strong and yet delicate skill in the middle. He commands a large crowd, and almost every scene is a mass action. We know that this is indeed not an easy task, if you want to use a crowd and also make each crowd fully express themselves.</p>
<p>There is no protagonist in this who takes sole charge from beginning to end, of course this is what European and American movies cannot do. Although the leader of the homeless children has more shots, it is definitely not that many people perform for him, so that he becomes a hero. He is just more important in this film. Regarding the individual performances of the actors, it can be said that they are all just right. They show joy and a robust spirit in construction work, and they also show fearlessness and confidence in difficulties.</p>
<p>As for other aspects, there are many shots that are suitable for the conditions of beauty. Such as the fight in the wilderness at night, such as the train rushing diagonally, etc. The sound is clear and crisp, especially the singing on the swaying cart at night, the chorus of homeless children, and the early morning birdsong (the scenery is also beautiful). The lighting can be used extremely flexibly, although there are few soft lights, on the contrary, there are many uniform force illuminations. As for the teenagers playing on the treetops, the riot in the factory, the throwing of basins and bowls during meals, and the singing and sweating while building the railway, these are all excellent scenes.</p>
<p>After the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, it is a joy for us to be able to see more of this kind of popular educational films. Chinese film artists can learn new techniques from this, and the audience can know that in addition to Hollywood's song and dance craze, there are also films with great significance.</p>

<p>When we saw those two truly authentic German UFA films, "The Merry Widow" and "The Last Waltz," we felt that kind of Viennese-style musical and dance romantic comedy was indeed magnificent enough to be called a masterpiece of UFA. Now, we can actually appreciate the third UFA film, and at the same time, Emil Jannings' new work - "Tide of Desire," how can we not say that this is a feast for our eyes.</p>
<p>In "Tide of Desire," we see another kind of flavor. It is the unbridled lust and infatuation that the masses in the lower society, whether male or female, possess. There is absolutely no talk of any playboy's romantic affairs here.</p>
<p>The plot of this film is full of excitement and very tense. When you see the thief being released from prison and seeing his lover being intimate with others with your own eyes, you will definitely receive a lot of major stimulation. The woman's indiscriminate love is for the sake of seeking carnal satisfaction. The society they are in is extremely humble and dark, but after you finish watching it, the emotion you receive, I am afraid, will also be a handful of tears of sympathy.</p>
<p>Speaking of everyone's expressions. Jannings' movements in each scene are very powerful, especially his expressions of laughter and tears after being released from prison, and the scenes of fighting with his rival, are both tense and exciting. This kind of inner expression of forgetting the control of reason for the sake of the rising tide of desire makes you very excited. Although we find the supporting actress Anna Sten very unfamiliar, her passionate expressions are a major help in this film. The lighting of the photography is well-placed, which adds a lot of beautification to this slum-style film.</p>
<h3>Review of "Such a Hero"</h3>
<p>— Yu Hong</p>
<p>Based on the ancestral "imitation" nature, the Chinese also produced a pair of oriental Laurel and Hardy in time, and then performed this hilarious "Such a Hero."</p>
<p>The plot of this film is very simple. It tells the story of two poor bums who look for people by looking for a dog. In the middle of this dog and people, they created their heroic name, and at the same time produced many jokes. Liu Jiqun completely failed in terms of expression and action. The reasons all lie in the words "making it hard." Han Lanben was originally a comedian on the stage, and he has made great contributions in this film. Although some places are inevitably a bit contrived, from the standpoint of comedy, it cannot be said that he is a good role. Secondly, talking about Tan Ying, in this film, in addition to drawing two terrible dark circles, it is not seen that she has any brilliant expressions. Furthermore, there are also many places in the whole play that are unreasonable. But in conclusion, when Chinese comedy talents are sleeping soundly, having this barely satisfactory work is enough to satisfy the audience's desires!</p>
<h3>Jean Harlow Will Dye Her Hair</h3>
<p>— Luo Fen</p>
<p>Since her husband Paul Bern's tragic suicide, blonde Jean Harlow has been unable to figure out why Paul committed suicide after all. Although there are various speculations from the outside world, and it is believed that Jean herself finally understands in her heart, Jean really does not know Paul's psychology. Recently, Jean suddenly took her anger out on her golden hair and wanted to dye her blonde hair dark brown. According to what she herself said to people, Paul said before his death that yellow hair was unlucky, or Paul's tragic death was related to blonde hair, so she decided to dye away her blonde hair.</p>
<h3>Film and Literary Taste</h3>
<p>— Huang Zhenxia</p>
<p>(6) Tide of Desire</p>
<p>This is a powerful work by UFA describing the life of Berlin's "underground layer." Emil Jannings plays a middle-aged man. The style is similar to the Vaudeville (Merry Widow) that he co-starred with Lya de Putti before. It is very international. People who live in big cities are very easy to feel resonance.</p>
<p>The program of the story unfolds like this: A talented thief in Berlin (Emil Jannings) is living together with Anna (Anna Sten), a young woman from Russia, and living a family life. However, because Anna is young and beautiful, she has a great desire for material things. At the same time, in order to please her, the thief often steals beautiful things behind her back, resulting in repeated imprisonments. Driven by the tide of desire, she repeatedly performed the trick of having affairs, and finally even stole her man's apprentice. The thief discovered this kind of thing, and also felt tired of living, so he obediently surrendered to the law, and engaged in "recuperation"</p>
<p>The outline of the story is like this. Emil Jannings set off the storm-like human emotions, and the final disillusionment, is extremely profound. It is said that Anna Sten was originally of Soviet nationality, but in this film she has completely transformed into a typical German young woman. Every move is entirely Berlin-style agility, playfulness, and also Berlin-style coquettishness and fashion. The popular ditty she sings: "I don't belong to any man, maybe any man owns a little bit of me," is also hummed out with a relatively gentle German-style melody.</p>
<p>The dialogue is in German. Of course, we lack the common sense of language and cannot understand it. However, for this reason, we can pay attention to the customs, actions, habits, and attitudes of all daily life of the Germans, especially the Berlin "underground layer" class, and increase a lot of understanding of foreign customs. What I am most happy about is that we have discovered another genius of UFA, that is: Anna Sten of Soviet Russia</p>
<h3>Common Sense of Watching Movies</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Jinping</p>
<p>When we are extremely bored, we may step into the cinema for a pastime. Have you paid attention to the following things?</p>
<p>(1) When taking young children to the cinema, never let them stand on the chair. Because it obstructs the view of the audience in the back row and annoys others.</p>
<p>(2) When the movie is playing, loud conversations should be absolutely stopped. Otherwise, the dialogue of the sound film is useless.</p>
<p>(3) It is best not to eat any snacks in the cinema. Otherwise, the melon and fruit shells will be littered all over the ground, and the audience may stumble and fall. Therefore, when you want snacks, it is best to eat some easily digestible candies.</p>
<p>(4) Frantically calling for cigarettes is harmful to the public health of entertainment venues; it also makes people who do not smoke sad.</p>
<p>(5) Spitting anywhere and coughing loudly are also unsanitary actions.</p>
<p>(6) When you are seeing something with great absorption, do not jump, shout, or yell wildly.</p>
<p>(7) When you encounter subtitles in the film, you can only silently recite them in your heart, and do not treat them like school homework, reading them aloud. Those who do not fully understand English should especially not use stiff pronunciation.</p>

<h3>A Section of Lyrics from "Spring Breeze, Willow Branches"</h3>
<p>— Xia</p>
<p>The other day, Mr. Wang Fuqing presented me with the lyrics from "Spring Breeze, Willow Branches," so I have specially recorded them here on the left, so that everyone will not be at a loss when they go to see the film; however, due to space limitations, the later part, which is Yang Naimei's "Qin Ge Yin," as well as Xia Peizhen's "Luan Feng Yin" and Hu Jia's "Fei Yan Yin," are all omitted.</p>
<p>1.  "Green grass has covered the soft branches, in the blink of an eye, youth is easily gone; the wind is blowing, the rain is drizzling, making my heart quietly sorrowful. Youth is infinitely good, may the moon always be full; may the flowers always be beautiful. Let the years flow like water, endlessly, why bother with spring flowers and autumn moons? Youth is infinitely good, may the birds pair, may people grow old together; why bother with seas drying up and rocks decaying! The wind and rain are blowing, let not the youthful years idly pass. The wind is blowing, stirring the tender buds of love; the rain is drizzling, moistening the flower buds of romance. My heart was originally lonely, but I didn't realize that love was disturbed by deep affection." 2. "The road of love is full of dangers, the realm of love is boundless, wipe away the tears from my brow; the wind is blowing, the rain is drizzling, stirring up ripples in my heart. A new song is played, like a phoenix seeking a mate, like a luan seeking a companion; it's hard to tell the difference between heaven and earth, intertwined in the same way, the love of high mountains and flowing water is hard to hide. A new song is played, the willow breeze blows, the flowing spring gargles the stones; harmonizing the melody revolving in the mouth and on the fingers; the secret meaning is filled with deep affection, the meaning of the song is filled with the man's affection; conveyed on the fine strings of the qin; my intention is continuous, stirring the trembling heartstrings, the qin song is like a thread, pulling together two hearts that are in harmony and connected."</p>

<h3>Abandoned Husband Bill of Divorce (Part 10.5)</h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>He walked slowly to the front of the music room, where there was also light inside. Peeking through the window, he saw Shirley lying on the sofa. He thought: She will marry that young Cade, and he, Hillary himself, will be lonely and helpless, with no relatives to turn to. Won't he be lonely? Isn't Mary willing to leave? No, he can't! He should give her up. She doesn't love him - hasn't he heard her say it herself? He should give her up! But what way can he make her feel at ease to leave? ... He thought of it! Only this method, pretending to go crazy again because he saw Gray and her together.</p>
<p>He tore the soft hat in his hand and suddenly ran to Shirley and shouted frantically. "Get them out! Quickly! I'm going to kill him! I'm going to kill him!"</p>
<p>Shirley, who was determined to stick to her current environment, wanted to comfort him. "Ah, Father. What are you saying? Calm down, don't be anxious!"</p>
<p>He continued to pretend to be crazy, "Over there," he shouted, "Mary and that man! Tell them to get out together! I don't want any of them in this house!"</p>
<p>Shirley tried to persuade him and then went out. She was confident that she could make Mary and Gray leave the house. When she came to the two sad lovers; Margaret was still weakly resisting Gray's pleading.</p>
<p>"Mother and Mr. Gray, please forgive me for having to say this." The sad couple listened in silence. "Please leave here together immediately. Nothing can stop you from having the happiness you deserve."</p>
<p>"How can I go and let your father suffer alone?" Margaret protested.</p>
<p>"He won't suffer alone, Mother. I will accompany him."</p>
<p>"You? ... What about Cade?"</p>
<p>"That matter was settled long ago, Mother. I will never marry - I can't marry. Now that you have regained your freedom, go, we will find happiness ourselves, don't worry." She turned to Gray, "Please take mother away, Gray."</p>
<p>Shirley looked at Margaret, very relieved, because her mother would finally get happiness. After she kissed Margaret goodbye, she turned back to Hillary in the music room. (To be continued)</p>
