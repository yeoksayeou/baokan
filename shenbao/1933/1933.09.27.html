<h3>美棉與國棉</h3>
<p>此次五千萬美金棉麥大借欵。規定。以五分之四購棉。五分之一購麥。此棉與麥。爲中國今日正感價格日落之農產品。其中之棉。更爲中國民族工業紗廠之唯一原料品。故其影響所及。當然與國民生計問題有甚大之關係。</p>
<p>最近一年來美棉之價格。曾下落至四分左右。開近百年來之最新低價記錄。此次借欵之初。在當局原意。或即欲乘此低價之際。吸收大量之原料。以發展我國之棉業。然而徵之於今日之事實。則絶非如當局者之所料。　羅斯福自登臺後。對外則拒絶貨幣之恊定。對內則實施通貨之澎脹。轉瞬數月。一般物價。已上昇至一倍有餘。即以最近美棉價格而論。已逹一角左右。而美國南部農民。又尙在要求抬高棉價。故昔日四五分之棉價。恐今已不可復得矣。其次。我國賒借棉麥之用意。或因鑒於前年棉麥之大量進口。遂推定今後亦將有同量之輸入。故以爲與其購以現金。不如暫行賒借。意非不是。然而實際上之情形。則又不然。蓋前年之棉麥大量進口。爲中國大水災後之特有現象。且每年輸入美棉之數雖不少。其大部分爲在華外廠所消費。就中尤以日廠之消費爲最多。綜此事實而觀。此五千萬美金棉麥借欵。於我中國本身之利益上至堪研究。</p>
<p>第一批之棉花。不久將自太平洋西岸連載以來。當局於茲第一批棉花行將到埠之時。爲國家利益及爲人民生計起見。自必預定有支配統制之方法。而吾人尤希望此支配統制之方法。能切實適宜而有益於民生。</p>
<p>在今日一般稍具見解者。莫不知美棉到埠之日。即國棉價格暴落之時。此就經濟學上供求之原理言。亦可謂爲今後必然之現象。中國國棉暴落以後。其直接受不利之影響者。當爲大部分之棉農。去年穀賤傷農之不幸。即其例證。其次。國棉暴落以後。日人必將起而大量吸收華棉。以補償其日印通商條約破棄後抵制印棉之損失。又以爲將來操縱華棉價格之工具。而在我國紗廠方面。旣受國棉暴落之影響。紗價目必愈趨愈下。則我紗廠之根基。亦將　形動搖。蓋以實際情形論。此四千萬美金之棉花。决難爲華廠所消容。結果大部分必將入於在華个廠之手中。而無形中加强其對我紗廠之競爭力。</p>
<p>故在此美棉尙未到埠之時。不能不先籌有適宜之統制方法。政府與紗廠金融界。應及早通力合作。以挽救紗廠前途之危機。而免增加將來民生之困苦。吾人借箸以籌。第一步應由紗廠與政府。出而維持中國國棉之棉價。不使因美棉到埠而下落。夫然後中國棉農或能稍免於無辜之災。而更藉以减少外商覬覦之心。第二步應由政府與金融界集資屯積美棉。一方面不使美棉擾亂中國國棉之市塲。一方面亦藉以削减外廠操縱壓迫之力。總之。此問題在今日甚爲重要。亡羊補牢。或非無策。吾人敢貢其一得之見。倘有關係方面果能予以注意。則不僅棉農與紗廠之幸也。</p>

<h3>金融市塲合併問題兩交易所糾紛解决</h3>
<p>杜月笙張嘯林從中調解</p>
<p>另籌兩百萬組織新市場</p>
<p>華東社云、關於本埠兩金業市塲合併問題、前者實部體恤商艱、於本年五月三十一日限期届滿之後、因雙方磋商、尙無眉目、故特再行展期三月、至八月三十一日爲止、期滿不得再展、以示政府態度、乃兩所當局、各因權利關係、期滿仍未合併、實部當局乃有强制停業之表示、幸本部商界聞人杜月笙·張嘯林·兩君、慨然出任調停、迄至本月二十四日遂正式解决、華東社記者、昨向兩所當局探詢、茲分詳如後、</p>
<p>（電請展期）實部當局、對於兩所合併依照功令、本須在本年五月三十一日以前解决、但當時物品交易所方面、祗將證劵部份與華商證劵交易所合併、金葉部份、則仍未能與金業交易所磋商解决、於是實部當局、乃准予再展三月、以便從容討論、並示以期滿不得再展、乃八月三十一日旣届、兩所態度、仍難接近、於是實部有强制停業、另行改組之表示、事爲杜月笙張嘯林兩氏所聞乃慨然出任調解、一面並電請竇部、在調解期內准予繼續營業、竇部允之、於是調解工作、前開始進行、</p>
<p>（調解成功）兩所交涉、迄未解决之原因、乃在雙方權利問題如經紀人之支配、以及市塲之選擇、最初物品方面之理事長虞洽卿·金業方面之理事長徐譜笙·數經討論、終難接近、中間曾提出另組金業第一及第二兩市塲、使名目統一營業亦可一律、乃又未能接近、杜張兩氏出任調解後、乃召集虞徐兩氏、開誠商洽、各以平均互惠爲原則、進行磋商、并提出辦法、雙方認爲滿意遂於本月二十四日、由杜張兩氏柬請物品虞洽卿聞蘭亭等、金業徐譜笙等在杭州飯莊繼續商洽、並當塲簽訂合約、正式解决</p>
<p>（另行組織）此項調解成立後、雙方决將原有之兩交易所名義取銷而另行合組一新交易所爲上海唯一金融市塲資本額定二百萬、名稱地址及如何組織等項、則先行組織一籌備委員會、由虞洽卿徐譜笙等爲籌備委員杜張兩氏亦均加入、以期雙方進行、不致再生扦格、</p>
<p>（兩月成立）該所名稱與地點、據兩所當局表示、現下尙未確立、惟地址是否在兩所中擇取其一或另行購置、大槪須視交通是否便利爲定、新市塲所在籌備期間、兩交易所市塲、仍照常營業、已由兩所當局及調人杜張兩君、分别電請實部查照、至於新市塲何日可以成立、則據物品交易所盛不華君語記者、大約在一二月之內、决不致於曠日持久也、</p>
<p>（全市統一）查實部當局所以命令合併、蓋因交易所法規定、同一區域、不得有同一性質之兩市塲、以免市情混淆、今兩所合併問題已告解决、在新市塲合組就緒後、則本埠方面、再無此項糾紛發生、而金業行市、亦可統一矣、又當兩所糾紛未解决時、本埠商人張澹如等、曾呈請社會局、轉呈市府、擬組金銀交易所、俾兩所交涉、一旦决裂、實部實行强制停業時、使金融市塲、不致中斷、今合併問題、旣告解决、正在籌備中之金銀交易所、可無另組之必要矣、</p>

<p>（運美貨亦遲誤）另有運往美國紐約、　貨二百餘噸、亦因已裝該行駁船內而爲罷工所阻、輪公司欲謀得該貨派工往起、被罷工者拒絶、此外更有大批猪鬃並絲頭一批、係裝至法國馬賽者、亦一併擱住、無法上輪、客家祇得延期運出、將該項擱阻各貨、統改十月三日裝船、但届時能否解决、猶未可知、</p>
<p>（客家損失交涉）各客家以罷工期內、爲會德豐駁船阻誤之絲茶等項、均關係各貨到逹歐美時市面有行情上落、而且出口貨均預計到逹日期、匪特銀行押匯及海程保險咸有關係、且受貨者因市上需要、更覺關係巨大、因之貴重貨物、必裝正班郵船、即係有一定到逹之時日、今各貨被駁船罷工擱延至十四天以上、種種問題、全行牽動、各客家損失頗重、現均函致會德豐交涉、要求負擔各貨誤期出口之全部損失、</p>

<h3>曁南連勝江大游泳錦標三年</h3>
<p>交通第二復旦第三大夏第四光華第五</p>
<p>交通無長程人才失敗女子臨時改表演</p>
<p>交通余榮邦破江大五十米自由式紀錄</p>
<p>第三届江大游泳大會、昨日結束、曁南又連得第三年之錦標、共計二十五分、交通十八分第二、復旦十四分第三、大夏八分第四、光華一分第五、交大余榮邦於五十米自由式中、以三十秒二之成績、打破曁南練顯南所保持之三十秒九江大紀錄、爲大會最生色之一項、其餘各項俱未見進步、女子組則因參加者僅一二人、改爲表演、茲錄各校得分、及决賽成績於下、</p>
<p>五校得分（一）曁南大學、二十五分、（二）交通大學、十八分、（三）復旦大學、十四分、（四）大夏大學、八分、（五）大光華學、一分、</p>
<p>曁南勝因曁南唯一之勁敵爲交通、其在短程及仰游泳中、成績皆不如交通、屈居其下、勝負之判决、全在四百米千五百米長程兩項、而曁南人才之平均、尤佔先着、無一項無人才、無一項不得分、此其所以勝也、</p>
<p>交通之敗交通殊有打倒曁南、奪取冠軍之聲勢、在短程五十米百米二項中、皆壓倒曁南、陳春秀之五十米、尤稱特色、陳湖之仰游及俯泳、亦爲曁南所不及、何奈四百米千五百米二項、無一個人才、不得不讓人高座矣、</p>
<p>形勢緊張曁南交通兩校競爭最烈、分數之相差甚微、百米仰游後、各得十八分、最後一項之千五百米、將决錦標、然回顧交通、在决賽名單中、無一個人才、於是曁南唾手可得、</p>
<p>一新紀錄昨日產生新紀錄一項、交通余榮邦以三十秒二打破曁南練顯南保持之五十米自由式江大紀錄、</p>

<h3>世界長跑名家納米之業餘資格問題</h3>
<p>國際體恊取消其資格</p>
<p>芬蘭體恊稱並未犯規</p>
<p>（倫敦通訊）世界運動界、因納米之地位、已發生一極有味之問題、去年國際業餘體育恊會、認爲納米違犯業餘規則、不准其參加亞林比克、但可異之事、爲納米最近已得又　芬蘭之錦標、據芬蘭體育恊會稱、納米並未犯規、非特納米個人認其爲業餘、芬蘭體育恊會亦然、故允許在芬蘭比賽、納米並未脫離業餘運動、亦未有如此擬議仍繼續努力破世界紀錄、並稱非爲金錢而賽跑、結果乃發生如此之特異情形、芬蘭稱之爲業餘國際體恊則取消之、據國際業餘規則之規定、凡業餘選手、不得在取消納米資格後、與之比賽、亦不得與曾與納米比　之運動員比賽、</p>
<h3>陳寶球應改參加十項王復旦</h3>

<h3>聰明</h3>
<p>— 思素</p>
<p>現代的人，到底不像古代人那樣優，說話不敢離事實過遠，聰明的了不得：而且彼此心照，不謀而合，只在是個聰明的法子，誰都無師自通，本能地會得幹，倒不可說它仿效，實在是現代人都具有聰明頭腦的緣故。就像不宣而戰，日本人是最擅勝塲的了，對帝俄如此，｜日俄宣戰之期，是一九零四年十二月二十四日，其實在二十二日，日本已開始軍事行動，出俄人不意，攻擊旅順，而將其封鎖，挫了俄軍的銳氣。同時更以聯合艦隊攻擊俄國泊於朝鮮仁川的艦隊，也得到大勝利，俄艦全覆。日本先在兩方面都打了勝仗，然後方於二十四日正式宣戰。俄海軍旣覆於仁川澳，幾不能海戰，只得路遠迢迢地從八千里外發艦隊來戰，又被日海軍以逸待勞，要擊於日本海而大敗，勝負之局遂判。記得俄國曾向國際呼籲不平，但勝利者終於勝利，誰肯在日本勝利後責備它不光明呢！！對我亦如此，｜這，倒並不全指九一八及一二八之不宣而戰，甲午中日之戰，日本也先戰而後宣，與對俄同。｜因而無役不勝。但是這種聰明法子，並不單是日本人纔擅勝塲，玻璃維亞巴拉圭也同樣地會幹。這是一。又像宣傳戰報，也不僅單是某，國最擅勝塲了，玻巴兩國也深得其中三味，所以玻巴戰事，自發生以來，到今已一年多，而誰勝誰負，却無人能知。近日國民社又有一電，謂據玻璃維亞消息稱：玻軍在德將毘德指揮之下，已擊退進攻之巴軍；而同日巴政府戰報，又稱：殲滅玻璃維亞精兵四團。國民社只好轉錄兩方戰報，究竟誰勝誰負，並不能置一詞。新聞記者尙不明實際戰况，普通人自更茫然了。打敗仗，原是當事者認爲最失面子的，有了這個法子，打敗仗之恥，便永遠在掩蔽之中，而反換了個最光榮的「擊退」敵方，或「殲滅」敵方。此所以謂之聰明，只怕古代人連做夢都想不到呢！</p>
<h3>石子仗</h3>
<p>— 蘭茜</p>
<p>一到秋天，又想起故鄉居民們的惡習慣來。－－打「石子仗」。</p>
<p>所謂「石子仗」者，意思表明此種戰爭，不用槍砲武器，完全採用石頭塊。雙方參加作戰的，當然是一般頭腦簡單而頑固的壯年和青年。他們在鄉間居住，家族之觀念至深，聚族而居，通力合作。如有侵吞及他們的田轩的，辱及他們的「自己人」的，其解决之法，便非一戰不可。於是他們便舉行「石子仗」了。他們不懂得什麽「哀的美敦」書，但「戰書」却也要互遞一下。約定地點與日期，摩拳擦掌的要給對方一頓好打。</p>
<p>他們的戰塲，多在山頭之處，雙方分佔了山之一半，各自佈置好進攻與埋伏的妥當地點。各方用大的筐籮載了無其數的大小石頭，旣尖銳而且堅硬，敎人看了要打寒噤的。而更有趣的是，他們更預備了許多「熟烟」，——廣東下等朋友們所常吸的一種，粗的烟葉，味濃，臨時捲在紙上吸的——預備石子打穿了頭，用來敷上以止血的。</p>
<p>石子仗多在秋天舉行，——取其凉快罷？</p>
<p>在鄉間時，我不大被允許去參觀石戰，一因年幼，二因家法嚴，——老祖母不許你染得惡印象。但最後的一年，我是十五歲了，偷着和同學們，走了很遠的路，到山上看去。情形是緊張的，你不能不掩頭而看。大小的石子在山頭之東西兩面如穿梭般的往來，雙方喊殺連天，如臨大敵。時有受傷而致死者。｜——其時的我，心恒惴惴焉。</p>
<p>然而我到上海已有九年了，不知道「石子仗」已經被禁也未？南方的人們是有血氣的，動不動以一戰見高下，然而也未免太過野蠻。</p>
<h3>騙術的一幕</h3>
<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>賊倒有笨賊。騙子，却非聰明人不能辦。因爲騙子要有縝密的心思，巧妙的手段。纔能使人看不出他的破綻，會進了他的圈套，騙到人家的財物。所以騙子的技術，是値得人們嘖嘖稱奇。可惜聰明誤用，「舍正路而弗由」，究成了個社會中的墮落者。</p>
<p>烟紙店，最容易受騙子們的欺詐。像前幾天，本埠南市某烟紙店，被兜售銅元的法子，騙去鈔票約六十。最近，在下所居的附近衖口一家小烟紙店，也受一個騙子的光顧。損失雖不多，但騙子也不過小施其技。現在記了出來，使一榖開設烟紙店的，可以見而留意。</p>
<p>一位衣冠楚楚的某甲，踏上那烟紙店，對着櫃內的人道：「我要買六塊錢××牌香烟。」那老板接了這筆大生意，連忙把烟包紥起來，交給他。甲便掏出一隻皮夾，正要付錢。忽然現着驚異色道：「咦·這裏錢不夠了。我是住在這衖內××號門牌，×姓。因爲明日家中有事，所以辦這許多烟。我來寫個住址字條給你，你派人將貨送來，付錢就是了。」老板道：「大家都是鄰舍。那末，我現在就呌人跟你去也好。」便命一個十幾歲的學徒，帶了香烟跟他走。進了衖，轉了一個灣，就到了。甲跨進××號門牌的大門，忽對那學徒道：「你把這東西交給我，你再去拿兩塊錢的肥皂來，快去快來，一同付錢。」學徒把烟交給過，還對裏面望了望，瞧甲很自然的進去。便奉命維謹，回到店裏，取了一大包的肥皂來。到了那家，却不見甲。放着喉嚨喊道：噲，肥皂送來了。」那樓窗上伸了一個婦人的頭來，答道：「誰要肥皂，你送錯了」。學徒楞了一楞，說明所以。婦人又道：「這裏是規規矩矩的人家，並没有這樣的人。」學徒纔知遇騙，急得流下淚來。後來老板也聞訊到來，問明了前情，也無法可想。祇狠狠的，駡了一聲「碰着個赤老」。學徒仍舊帶了肥皂，悄悄地回去！</p>
<h3>個摩登小姐天的生活</h3>
<p>— 波臣</p>
<p>是寫字間裏上半天停止辦公的時候，某公館的Ｃ小姐剛剛起身啦，懶懶地，疲倦地。</p>
<p>輕輕地走到無綫電機前，開在外國電台的號碼上，頓時奏起幽幽動人的西方歌調。伊坐在柔軟的沙發上，抽着「茄立克」，跟着片裏的歌聲，低低地喝着。</p>
<p>不經意的翻開了報紙，幾個帶有誘惑性的廣告跳進伊的眼簾，××公司１９３３年最「摩登」服裝大减價。跟着「阿二」預備好了汽車，伊跳上去後，汽車便在柏油路上滾動。</p>
<p>從××公司回來，會客室坐着蜜司特張。啊，伊勇敢地和他偎抱着，一個深長的甜蜜的Ｋiss。</p>
<p>『午後請你去看「鳳求凰，」我的寶貝一定要賞臉的。』</p>
<p>『啊：：：：』</p>
<p>吃中飯的時候，是在三點鐘。忙着在臉上化了半天美容術。愉快地，在人語衣香中踏進影戲院，情語：：：伊心裏滿蕩着春意。</p>
<p>帶有輕快的笑意走出了影戲院。</p>
<p>「維也納，」阿二問了伊以後的答復，汽車又在柏油路上滾動。｜夜深。</p>
<p>是天纔破曉，工人們上工的時候，某公館的Ｃ小姐剛剛睡啦，懶懶地，疲倦地。</p>
<h3>東北四連長</h3>
<p>— 張恨水</p>
<p>第十六回　　酸楚襟懷當前還祝福　　倥偬戎馬暗裏突移軍</p>
<p>積之雖然是對了這張三的背坐着的，可是聽了他這話，也不由得臉上紅了一陣。默然了一會，然後問道：你們拉車的人，停在什麽地方，就喜歡道論這個地方住家的人，你信口胡謅的吧？張三聽了這話，有些不服氣，就站住了脚，回轉頭來向他望着道：二爺，你不信，咱們繞着一點兒灣子走，在海甸街上走過去，稱許咱們碰着那個好機會，就瞧見他倆在街上挽着手胳臂走路。積之猛然的答道：那也好，於是兩個人都不說話，車子拉着飛跑，奔向海甸大街而去。積之坐在車上，眼見海甸的街市，快到眼前了，忽然用脚在車踏板上連連頓了幾下道：别向前拉，我不到海甸去。張三道：拉到了這裏，不走海甸，可没有路走。他口裏如此說着，車子是照樣的向前拉。積之不能攔住他，又不好意思跳下車來，就在車子上嘆了兩口氣。張三心裏，倒有些奇怪，把他拉上海甸走一趟，這也是很平常的事，爲什麽倒要心裏這樣不痛快。因之他將車子拉一截路，少不得又回頭向積之看上兩眼。積之深怕讓他看出了　，自己有什麽吃醋的意味。於是笑道：你要拉我到海甸去，我就讓你拉去罷。張三笑道：眞的，我不寃你，他們兩個人要好着啦，常是手牽手的上乳茶舖子裏去談心。不信，你到乳茶舖裏去打聽打聽。積之笑趙：我有那樣喜歡管閑事嗎？張三笑着，也就把車子拉了飛跑到海甸街上來。積之自己心裏想着，總是曾在這海甸街上住過的人，就是坐了車子，在街上經過一趟，這也是極平常的事，又何必自難爲情。就扳住了面孔，由張三拉着。（一九八）</p>

<h3>法國人眼中的中國民族</h3>
<p>— 朱梅自法國寄</p>
<p>法國之所以値得被人稱作文明國家，是因爲他的國家的一切設施走上了軌道，法國人不多受過敎育，而且他們的觀念並不存着要害人的，他們絶對地愛他們的權利，但他們之愛義務是完全與愛權利的心同。以此種心性的人民來看中國民族，到底會是什麽，這是不難想到的。尤其是我們從事實所給與他們的，這就是中國人來法國和他們接觸後所給與他們的印象，而其次則是他們的敎育給與他們的影響。在歐洲說起來，法國比較是待中國人算好的，雖然他們是很不歡喜中國人，因爲他們所接近的差不多都是小商販，提着一個小皮箱，法文也講不來，人的面孔黃黑而瘦小，衣服也不整潔，這類中國人不但羣居巴黎，而且散佈全法國所有的城鄉僻野。而有智識的中國學生，他們當然很難接近，他們都在大城市的大學裡唸書，不能夠無事到小地方去跑。因此，只要是看見過中國人的他們，一談起來總是要加上許多不好的譏笑的形容辭，倘若是偶然的碰見了整潔有禮貌的中國學生，常常是當作日本人的。說起他們的敎育，法國中學敎育對於中國是最腐敗的。我曾調查他們的歷史與地理敎科書，親自檢閱過他們的地圖，發現了許多可驚異的事。他們的世界歷史對於中國的叙述完全是一世紀以前的事，面孔不但黃而已，而且頭上還有一條尾巴。更可怪的是把一個女人的小脚特别解放在桌上照一個像，關於此事我曾和我所認識的法國人解釋，我說這已經是歷史上的遺跡了，法國從前不是也有許多可怕的壞習慣麽？但是，他們的確曾於一九三三年還在巴黎看見過這種小脚女人，當時我以爲那些法國人造謠，或者是中國的老太太也不定；後來經我調查，巴黎不但有許多小脚女人，伊們還是做小販，背上背一個小娃兒，不但不是老太婆而且還是很年青的。如果以這樣的女人來指定說中國女人都是如此，不但太寃枉了麽？但如此一來他們把百多年前歷史上的事做敎科書而現在彷彿還認爲是新鮮的呢。其次說到地理，我想法國人的地理恐怕是請是本人編的。這是怎麽說起呢？就是以舊的中國說，也有不折不扣的二十二行省，但他們對於中國的叙述只是注重南方，不提中國有幾多省，故他們問我是那一省人？我說是四川，他們再也懂不得中國會有一個四川。而地圖更荒唐，世界無論那一國，都有一張特别的地圖，小如日本也有一張與英國相等的，中國僅僅是在一個亞細亞的地圖之上，而整個中國只有四省，江蘇，浙江，雲南，廣東，其餘四川，湖南等絶對没有，有西藏省，而西藏省的顏色與英國及英國殖民地的顏色完全相同，滿洲里與日本的顏色相同。當時我曾問一個在中學當地理敎員的朋友，那地圖是最近出版的麽？他說已經二十多年了。另外我還看見一張世界地圖，每一個國家以顏色區别，而同時每一個國家用一個人描寫出那國家特有的精神。比如美國是一位穿得極講究的紳士，他手裡拿着一本簿記，表示這是理商業的國家，德，英，波蘭，俄國，日本等：：：應有盡有，而日本人是赤手赤脚勞苦的樣子，獨於世界全圖上没有中國這國家！這是一張世界地圖，是全法國各低級學校的敎本。我們想一想，法國人是從如此的敎育中培養出來的，他們對於中國民族的印象是怎樣？</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>杭州的八月</h3>
<p>— 郁達夫</p>
<p>杭州的廢曆八月，也是一個極熱鬧的月份。自七月半起，就有桂花栗子上市了，一入八月，栗子更多，而滿覺隴南高峯翁家山一帶的桂花，更開得來香氣醉人。八月之名桂月，要身入到滿覺隴去過一次後，纔領會得到這名字的相稱。</p>
<p>除了這八月裏的桂花，和中國一般的八月半的中秋佳節之外，在杭州還有一個八月十八的錢塘江的潮汛。</p>
<p>錢塘的秋潮，老早就有名了，傳說就以爲是吳王夫差殺伍子胥沈之於江，子胥不平，鬼在作怪之故。論衡裏有一段文章，駁斥這事，說得很有理由；『儒書言，「吳王夫差殺伍子胥，煑之於鑊，盛於囊，投之於江，子胥恚情，臨水爲濤，溺殺人。」夫言吳王殺伍子胥，投之於江，實也，言其恨恚，臨水爲濤者，虛也。且衛葅子路，而漢烹彭越，子胥勇猛，不過子路彭越，然二子不能發怒於鼎鑊之中，子胥亦然，自先入鼎鑊，後乃入江，在鑊之時其神豈怯而勇於江水哉？何其怒氣前後不相副也？』可是論衡的理由雖則充充足，但傳說的力量，究竟十分偉大，至今不但是錢塘江頭，就是廬州城內淝河岸邊以及江蘇福建等濱海傍湖之處，仍舊還看得見塑着白馬素車的伍大夫廟。</p>
<p>錢塘江的潮，在古代一定比現時還要來得大。這從高僧傳唐靈隱寺釋寶逹，</p>
<p>誦咒咒之，江潮方不至激射湖上諸山的一點，以及南宋高宗看潮，只在江干候潮門外塔高臺的一點看來，就可以明白。現在則非要東去海寗，或五堡八堡，纔看得見銀海潮頭一綫來了。這事情從阮元的揅經室集浙江圖考裏，也可以看得到一些理由，而江身沙漲，總之是潮不遠上的一個最大原因。</p>
<p>還有梁開平四年，錢武肅王爲築捍海塘，而命强弩數百射濤頭，也只在候潮通江門外。至今海寗江邊一帶的鐵牛鎭鑄，顯然是師武肅王的遺意，後人造作的東西。（我記得鐵牛鑄成的年分，是在清順治年間，牛身上印在那裏的文字，還隱約辨得出來。）</p>
<p>滄桑的變革，實在厲害得很，可是杭州的住民，直到現在，在靠這一次秋潮而發點小財，做此賣賣的，爲數却還不少哩！</p>
<h3>文統之夢</h3>
<p>— 逹一</p>
<p>予旣爲道統之夢一文，刊諸自由談矣。或謂儒林傳中人物好爭道統，固已：文苑傳中人物亦爭文統，子有言之乎？予曰，爭文統者，自唐宋以來古文家皆優爲之，降至有清，駢文復振，阮元汪中之流，又幾爲駢文爭得正統矣。倘語其朔，道統適與文統同源，孔聖人兩肩，一肩道統，一肩文統，道之未喪，斯文之未喪，繫於一人之身，所謂自生民以來，未有如我夫子者也。</p>
<p>文統之夢，蓋南北朝文人恒有之。劉勰作文心雕龍，其序略云：予齒在逾立，嘗夜夢執丹漆之禮器，隨仲尼而南行，寤而喜曰，大哉聖人之難見也，迺小子之埀夢歟？敷讚聖旨，莫若注經，而馬鄭諸儒，弘之已精，就有深解，未足立家。唯文章之用，實經典技條，五禮資之以成，六典因之致用。於是搦筆和墨，乃始論文。可知劉勰夢見孔子，隱然以文統自肩，而以道統讓之經生腐儒。微惜其攻乎異端，皈依佛氏，正與今之妄以道統自肩者同病，貽羞往聖而不自知也。</p>
<p>江淹少以文章顯，晚節才思微退。嘗夜夢張景陽謂曰，前以一匹錦相寄，今可見還，淹探懷中，得數尺與之。張大恚曰，那得割截得盡！又嘗夢見郭璞謂曰，吾有筆在卿處多年，可以見還。淹乃探懷中，得五色律一以授之。江郎僅謂夢得晋詩人張景陽郭璞之傳，而不敢遠承孔聖人之文統，殆晚年才盡，乃肯爲此格外克己之言歟？</p>
<p>紀少瑜幼時，嘗夢陸倕，以一束青鏤管筆授之云，我以此筆猶可用，卿自擇其善者，其文因此遒進。鄭灼少時，嘗夢與皇侃遇於途，侃謂曰，鄭郎開口，侃因唾灼口中，自後義理益進。李廣博涉羣書，有才思，邢魏之亞。嘗欲早朝，假寐，忽驚覺，謂其妻曰，吾向似睡非睡，忽見一人出吾身中，語云，君用心過苦，非精神所堪，今辭君去。因而恍忽不樂，數日便遇疾，積年不起。夢詩魂出體而詩人死，夢文豪授筆而文思進，夢哲人與唾而義理精，何以此一時代文人輒有奇夢，而夢竟可徵乎？蓋當時文士，好自誇大，結習已深；託夢表異，以爲繼承古人或先輩之文統，亦其誇大之一術也。其在未足齒數之文人，亦有妄爲誇大者：吳邁遠好自高，而蚩鄙他人。每作詩得稱意語，輙擲地呼曰，曹子建何足數哉？擅超聞而笑曰，昔劉季緒才不逮於作者，而好抵訶人文章，季緒瑣瑣，焉足道哉！至於邁遠，何爲者乎？又陳郡袁嘏，自重其文，謂人云，我詩應須大材迮之，不爾飛去。此等妄人，非以近代心理學家所謂誇大狂當之，殆無從解釋矣。</p>
<h3>旅途雜筆（續）</h3>
<p>— 天馬</p>
<p>「把他的包裹拿進來！一柄陽傘，一領被頭也可以！」賬房先生又發命令。</p>
<p>於是哭聲起了，求老爺開恩，而浮在哭聲和乞憐聲上面的，則是怒叱，辱駡，以及拳頭挨着肉體的悲鳴與「唉喲」的呌喊，這樣，混成一片。</p>
<p>每次逢着這樣的悲劇，我總是不忍看，又不忍不看。這悲劇，可就正是農村破產的象徵，</p>
<p>可憐的農夫農婦們懷着金色的幻夢來到城市，又懷着失望的悲哀回轉農村。這樣流離着，輾轉着。</p>
<p>三孤山</p>
<p>船過孤山，正是在一個美麗的黃昏時候，夕陽入水，彩霞幻變，風景如畫。站在船的最高層，遠遠地我便望見了那蒼翠一點，在洶湧的江流中，好像是要隨水東流一樣，船越走越近，孤山却依然是那樣峭拔地屹立在江心，脚跟站得像鐵一般的堅牢，輕蔑地睨視着足下的濁流。洶湧咆哮着的江水迎面撲來，但一到它的脚前，便終於只有無可奈何地拖着失敗的嘆息　着它身邊逃過去。</p>
<p>看見孤山，我又想起了故鄉的君山。可是君山比孤山大，而湖水也没有江流那樣湍急，我們當然用不着担心它一朝會被驚濤駭浪捲去。到於孤山呢，只是青螺般大，而又是立脚在激湍的江流中，但它却像是比泰岱還要穩重，還要嚴肅，任是狂風暴雨，任是排天倒海的怒潮，都不能動搖它的脚跟，這眞令我由衷地興起敬意。</p>
<p>陶知行先生過孤山曾有詩：</p>
<p>「誰說孤山小？脚跟立定；號令長江水，现北兩邊繞。」另一首是：</p>
<p>「誰說孤山小？孤山年紀老：東西往來舟，浮沉知多少？」</p>
<p>兩首中我最喜歡脚跟立定了一句，我覺得只有那一句最有力，最感人，也只有那一句纔眞夠讚誦孤山。</p>
<h3>三等車中</h3>
<p>— 巴金</p>
<p>－旅途隨筆之一</p>
<p>坐火車似乎不是一件愉快的事情，三等車裏更不是舒適的地方，但這一兩年來我的一部分的時間就在三等車裏面花費去了。彷彿有好些人說過羡慕我所過的生活的話，這些情形他們是不會知道的。</p>
<p>說要走，說了一兩個星期了。一些朋友在路上遇見我就會問：『怎麽還在上海？』我除了『明天走』一句簡短的答語外就找不出第二句。的確我每一天都是預備着『明天走』的，但出乎我的意料之外，結果這『明天』却捱到一兩個星期以後了。寃枉的是有些人會疑心我在故意欺騙他們。</p>
<p>在一個黃昏裏送了Ｗ夫婦上車回來，我同着Ｍ走着到中國旅行社去的路。我們兩個都不熟習上海的道路，當時我並没有决定這晚就走，也没有决定就到中國旅行社去買車票，我們不過在那些比較平坦的馬路散步，談談那些這許多時候以來折磨着我們的青年的心的問題。周圍的景色我們是看不見的。Ｍ和我一樣，我們的心中都刻印着一幅未來的圖畫，這圖畫上所展示的，我們相信，是人類社社進化途中所必定經過的一個階段。然而别的人不承認，他們說我們是拿了幻想來欺騙了自己。我們不覺得我們的錯。那圖畫是洗滌不去的，當初牠被刻印在我們的心上的時候，那也曾費過不少的工匠的力量，而且也經過長久的時間。對於我們牠永遠是鼓舞的泉源，牠不斷地給我們帶來希望，尤其是前幾天朋友Ｘ從遠迢迢的地中海畔帶了另一個古國的好消息回來以後。雖然我和Ｍ心裏都充滿着離别的情緒，但我們並不曾感到悲哀。我們那時的談話都是關於未來的，那些都是美麗的話語。</p>
<p>天色逐漸陰沈起來，我們却不覺得；燈火亮了，我們也不覺得。在我們的眼前隱約地現着那光明美麗的遠景。無意間走到了四川路的中國旅行社，我們進去買了票。</p>
<p>『那天走？』</p>
<p>『今天晚上』。</p>
<p>我没有躊躇地回答着。出了門，我纔想起：今晚上就要走了。這時候我突然感到了把時間浪費在火車上輪船裏是一件怎樣不幸的事情。</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>行李是臨時收拾的，那也花不了許多時間。Ｖ夫婦送我到車站時，不過十點多鐘，而火車要到十二點鐘纔開駛。我本來用不着人送我到車站，但Ｖ夫人說，『一個人走，冷清清的，没有人送，很可憐。』我也不能夠拒絶他們。</p>
<p>在月台上我們找着了Ｍ，他在那裏等我們。現在誰也不會覺得寂寞了。Ｖ提着我的籐包，我們上了車。</p>
<p>車廂裏客人很少，有許多空地方。我從籐包裏取出了被褥在長凳上攤開來，心裏想今晚上一定可以暢快地睡一夜了。（未完）</p>
<h3>文盲撲滅所（四）</h3>
<p>— 康司坦丁·斐爾作林翼之譯</p>
<p>「可是你說，鎔鐵爐工塲跟你没有關係，那你却錯誤了，這决不是跟你無關的事。」</p>
<p>「我不知道呀。」馬麗亞福特洛芙娜怯生生地說着，便問了：「報紙上寫着的，你全部都知道麽？」</p>
<p>「那有不知道的事，」丁加苦笑着說：「當然，全都知道。」</p>
<p>「你希望在五月十五日開工麽？」</p>
<p>丁加笑了：</p>
<p>「當然希望。」沉默了一下，突然堅决的說：「全國都在希望的呀，所以我這樣希望，你也」</p>
<p>這樣······」</p>
<p>「什麽，我？」她吃驚地說。</p>
<p>「你當然也希望。」丁加决斷地說：「當然，你也希望，你不是一個正同我們一起進地的智識工人麽，我們豈有不明白之理？」</p>
<p>「我却不大明白呢。」她說。</p>
<p>「說不定會這樣的，」丁加同意地說：「這樣的事常常有的，我自己，在從前也是不明白地。我今年六十歲了，可是直到現在還剛剛明白。我六十歲，你怕還不到四十歲吧。」</p>
<p>「我三十七歲，」她紅着臉說。</p>
<p>「對啦，是年齡關係吧，我今年雖已六十，可是我還不老。」他臉色異常嚴肅，她似正在說大道理。</p>
<p>「你以爲我是怎樣的人？」他儼然地問。</p>
<p>「我不知道。」</p>
<p>「我是墮落者，一個流氓階級。」</p>
<p>「什麽？」馬嚴亞福特洛芙娜想不到丁加這農民般的樣子，會說出這樣的話，着實吃了一驚。</p>
<p>「一個流氓階級呀。」丁加重覆說一句。</p>
<p>「流浪的酒鬼，但現在，我是一個突擊隊的隊員，一個無產階級，我一生祇跑了獨脚路，」</p>
<p>可是現在，却變了兩隻脚，脚脚踏了實地呢，在我的四周圍，包圍着我的，是工廠，是建設事業。」</p>
<p>他跟馬麗亞告了别，向對面大踏步走去了。（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談希望游怡</h3>
<p>現在的人說；「我們不要悲懷過去，我們亦不要憧憬未來，我們祗須抓住現實，現實。」</p>
<p>所謂「憧憬未來」啊，就是「希望」。</p>
<p>「希望」之於人，有時能使人燃燒出向上的熱情，然有時也能使人由失望而灰心。</p>
<p>「希望」本來没有止境，而目的也很不容易逹到。</p>
<p>其實，「希望」究竟與人們脫不了關係的，譬如我在寫這一篇東西時候的「希望」，便是希望可以寫得充實一點，像伶人在戲檯上演戲一樣，可以博得比較多一點的彩聲。而待到這篇東西寫好後送到報館裏時，又希望早一天發表起來了。</p>
<p>然而「希望」畢竟是渺芒的多，我在小學裏的時候，那時不過十齡左右吧，我們的國文老師出了一個作文題目，呌做「我的志願」的，於是許多的天眞未泯的小學生，大家運用他們的簡單的腦經起來了，伸紙吮毫，心不旁鶩，有的說將來要做一個大政治家，像諸葛亮一樣的：有的說要做一個大發明家，像瓦特一樣的：也有的說要做一個戰無不勝攻無不克的大將軍像孫武子一樣的，也有想做大實業家的，也有想做開發礦產的，我在那時，也何嘗不是以濟世安民自任，而意氣不可一世。可是十餘年來，東西奔波，飽經所謂「世故」，雖然壯志未盡消沉，也無復當年夢幻了。</p>
<p>但是「希望」究竟仍是有的，我的所以仍舊能夠拖着受過創傷的身子在人生道上奮鬥，便是「希望」在後面鼓勵着我，督促着我；我不但「希望」並且相信，我認爲現在的中國未嘗没有救。同時我更相信光明之終久會到來。</p>
<p>固然，「希望」有點近於自欺，然而合理的希望是對的。而逹到「目的」也比較容易一些。</p>
<p>我幹的時候是抓住現實，而我却不是一味悶幹的，我一方面也在瞻顧「未來」我看看距離我的「希望」究竟還有多少路？而我有時候也回過頭來看看「過去」，不過我却不是「悲懷」，而是「溫故知新」。</p>
<p>然而另一方面的「希望」却有點不敢恭維，好比××獎劵的票價是一元，而頭獎確有五萬元，誰不願意化一隻老洋去碰一碰運氣，碰上了便是五萬倍的利息登時平步青雲，面團團成爲富家翁，是多麽幸運的事！然而，然而究竟祗有五十萬人當中的一個人碰到這個所謂「運氣」，有四十九萬九千九百九十九人要失望的！</p>
<p>畢竟「希望」是渺茫的多。</p>
<p>然而以「切實的目標」來代替「合理的希望」時，那就非有不可了。</p>
<h3>「生產」與「消費」關係爾礎</h3>
<p>時常，我們很知道社會的進化是基於人類的不斷的「生產」與不斷的「消費」的。因爲消費是求滿足人類普遍的慾望的，－而人類的慾望是着時代的需要以而遞遷加增的－所謂普遍的慾望者，即生活之要素衣食住行等而。人類所已通早晚不息的忙着「生產」，無非是爲的「消費」。換言之，便是欲滿足一己之慾望。那麽，爲「消費」而「生產」這句話，該是没有異議的吧？</p>
<p>高出水平線的慾望，便是奢望了。</p>
<p>爲滿足某一種奢望而「消費」的，那便該稱爲是「糜費」了。</p>
<p>中國是一個「生產」落後的國家，這該是無可諱言的事吧？中國人除了僅有的農民－如今農村也崩潰了，還有什麽可說。－在大清早做到天黑，一年做到頭的努力「生產」外，其他多半是祗會「消費」－，甚至糜費的人，尤其是都市裏的一般老爺，先生，太太，小姐，他們，她們，是在洋人的驅使下做着所謂「高等華人」的，這般「主子的奴才」懂得些什麽「生產」，也許是懂得的，能「生產」的，那便是替洋人「生產」了，住洋房，坐馬托車，提倡洋貨，···差一點連中國的飯也不要吃，而去吃洋麫包了。－事實上已很多－呵！農村崩潰，生產落後！</p>
<p>於是，「消費」過於「生產」的畸形現象必然的呈現了。洋貨乘機充斥市塲，以形成今日被稱爲「國際市塲」的中國！言之殊堪痛心！</p>
<p>這種現象的展露，便是「生產」與「消費」相互超越所致。因爲「生產」是支配「消費」的，「消費」是支配慾望的，慾望是支配「生產」的。如果，某一種超越或落後這互相爲關的循環的定例後，必然的要顯露某一種相當的恐怖。這種恐怖，便是社會之不安寗與個人生活之不安定。假使，「生產」超越了「消費」，當然要爲「生產」過剩而擔憂。（現在的歐美各國正是處於這種情况之下）「消費」超越了「生產」，便感及經濟的恐慌。咱們中國正是適當其口的喧鬭着「生產」落後經濟恐慌的亂子，搆成了社會的不安寗與個人生活之不安定，祗管受着歐美「消費」的誘惑，而亟求摹倣。於是，自動離間了「國家觀念」與「自救的途徑」什麽消費都傾向歐化，爲洋人「生產」爲洋貨推銷，救濟了生產過剩的歐美。然而對於歐美的「生產」，却擱置腦後，而依舊於十八世紀手工業與十九世紀鐵工業的交叉時期中，和歐美的「生產」相差遠哩！</p>
<p>總之，「生產」與「消費」，必須有平等的發展，方可以漸求進步。這句幾何定例，反正像　一般的告訴了我們。有誰敢否認呢？</p>

<h3>暴風雨的夜裏人</h3>
<p>這是一個狂風暴雨的夜裏。珠般大的雨點兒急驟地加緊地傾瀉着；怒吼着的狂風，差不多要把撑了傘的路人騰空起來！我在十點鐘的時候，就上福煦路的九路公共汽車站，一等等到十點半還不曾看見過車子的影子，我想一定是因爲這暴風雨的緣故，而不會再有車子在開駛了吧！於是轉變了方向，跑到西摩路去搭電車。</p>
<p>我搭上了一路電車，車裏盡是濕的滴着水珠，我的衣服全都潮透了，怪覺得寒意而在顫抖着。隔着掛滿汗珠的玻窗，望望車廂的外面，非但行人已絶了踪跡，就是各色各樣的車輛，也是希少得如晨星了。其實這時才祇十點三刻呀，在都市裏應當正是熱鬧的時候呢。車廂裏有幾個着黃色　服的，大約是電車公司裏的職員，他們在說：「還有二輛七路電車，」無意中這給我的該是怎樣的欣慰啊｜因爲我需要七路電車，送我回家去呢。</p>
<p>在外灘下了車。風更加緊了，雨像傾盆的水向大地上狂瀉着｜手裏雖然拿了一把小傘，可是它已經失却了它的效用，傘柄已被狂風吹折斷了｜冰冷的雨水浸濕了我的全身，不多一會，駛來了一輛裝滿着落水鷄般的車輛，我没命地也向車子裏擠進去，似乎獲得了一個庇護所，而頓時心裏感着尋到生路一樣的快愉。這時候，江水向岸上倒瀉着，馬路已成一條條的小河，四五寸高的街沿，都浸没在流動着的水裏了！馬路！不應當說，小河的中心，汽車一輛一輛的駛過去，也不能像平時那般瘋狂威武底迅速了，它的浸没了一大半的車輪在水中駛進，眞活像汽油船的行動。</p>
<p>我們的電車停在百老匯路和西華德路交叉的地方徬徨着。乘客的意思說走華德的，因爲百老匯路地勢低，預料水是很深的。可是那開車者没有聲明理由的說：「洋大班已有命令要走百老匯路」。於是他冒了雨下車去鑿路，鑿了足足十五分鐘，我們實在等到不耐煩了，一方面又看見路上的水在漸漸地漲着。結果仍走華德路，而我們也并不曾應騐他的洋大班的話「有不測之危險」。十一點半，我安然的到了家。</p>
<p>現在！就是我提筆寫這篇記事的時候，風已經停了，雨已經住了，小河已經恢復成了馬路，我的潮濕的衣服，已經乾燥了；天空的嬌陽，也已經揚眉吐氣的施展着它的偉大的「力」了······一切，都與平日没有絲毫異樣，只有我們的身心感到非常適意和輕鬆｜因此，我得了一個啓示：</p>
<p>天氣到了某一個時間，必然地是要來一個驚人的狂風暴雨的。但一件事，我們應當明白的，就是在這個狂風暴雨的過程中，無疑的，每一個路人都要遭遇相當的困難，這時，我們是需要不驚駭，不逃避，忍耐奮鬥！因爲，不久的將來，就是我們的適意輕鬆，太陽重揚眉吐氣地施展它的偉大的「力」的晴天了！</p>
<h3>府上那裏？劍屏</h3>
<p>大約在前星期六的下午五點鐘的光景吧！我所座的這部逢碼頭開喪的鎭滬車，總算有氣没力的停靠在眞茹車站了，我正想整理一下在這長途裏翻亂的書籍和報紙，以免到了上海，再覊留我這厭倦的身子。</p>
<p>忽然有一種雜亂的革履聲，和「現世惡來」的英語聲，打破了車廂，暫時的沉寂，我迴頭一看，却是剛上來兩個我們中國未來的闊客－大學生－於是不由我不向他們行了個注目禮，但是像我這樣的蹩脚文人，簡直他們見都未見。</p>
<p>車又蠕蠕的動了，一車的乘客，都不約而同的伸了一個懶腰，這自然是期望着的目的地將到的快示；可是宛比生力軍的兩位大學生，却正在滔滔不絶的講他們的英語，什麽「却而司登」，又什麽「密史密史」的簡直没停過嘴，當然，三等車裏的乘客，是工商界居多，所以對於這一對鶴立鷄羣的大學生，都不免有些仰慕和崇拜，於是他們更加得意了。</p>
<p>「請敎二位先生！府上那裏？」忽然半夜裏殺出個程咬金似的一個布衣老者，和顏悅色的這樣問他們：</p>
<p>「唔！廣東香山，我們是同鄉，」他們不禁有些懷疑而這樣的回答他：</p>
<p>「廣東香山，好像是還在我國版圖之內，何以二位所講的都是外國話呢？」老者更進一步的這樣追問：</p>
<p>「這······」·大學生躊躇了半嚮，還没有回答，恰巧這時車已到站，這才無形的解除了他們的窘迫。</p>
<p>餘業信箱</p>
<h3>力不足</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個未滿二十歲的貧寒青年，現在一家小商店內做一個小職員；所入很微，而且微得很可憐。我的家庭，又異常迫於經濟；有信來呌我寄錢回去。可是我又没有能力，因此想另謀比較高尙一些的職業。却又心有餘而力不足，於是我日坐愁城，受着這惡毒環境壓迫，眞的一籌莫展。試問我對這樣的環境，怎樣辦法？請先生在貴刊上圓滿答覆，不勝感激之至。敬頌</p>
<p>撰安顧耀華謹上</p>
<p>編者按：顧君因爲要照顧他貧寒的家庭，想另謀一個高尙些的位置；這是現社會一般人所同具的願望。「人望高山水望低，」誰不想多弄幾個錢，去奉其父母，贍其妻子呢？不過顧君没有再往下想一想。你爲何「力不足」呢？「力不足」怎樣可以補救？那末你就知道你必須加倍努力地去修養你自己了。學問也，經騐也，世故也，在在有修養之必要。倘使因爲要供給貧寒家庭用途起見，你祗知道想謀一個高尙些的位置：這是鏡花水月，一輩子不會如願的。你必得更進一步想如何去修養你自己。這樣成効雖不能期於旦夕，但久而久之，自有逹到目的的一天。願世之「力不足」者，急起直追，培養其實力；毋務爲「怨天尤人」或「畫餅充飢」之勾當，斯可矣。我們接到許多來信，說的話雖各各不同，但都半祗希望於收入之增加，不能兼顧能力之修養。這種舍本求末的觀念，或亦爲現社會不安狀態重要原因之一。特乘顧君詢問之便，申論如上。</p>
<p>編者於此，更有一言，爲天下爲父母者告。夫人本有敎育兒女之義務，今以自身經濟困難關係，不能充份盡此義務，原屬不可避免之憾事；但至少限度，在其「力不足」之前，切不可責之太嚴。每見許多很有希望的青年，因爲家長督責太嚴，因而流於冐險及僥倖之一途，甚或出於作弊之下策，終至志氣全消者，實屬可惜。天下無不愛子女之父母，幸注意焉。</p>

<h3>戰爭與和平（三四）（四幕劇）凌鶴</h3>
<p>第三幕和平禮讚</p>
<p>校長：哼，可不是。所以現在我們唯一的康莊大道，便只有拚命抵抗。我們應當爲自衛而抵抗，我們應當爲義而戰爭。（此時軍事當局已經走到了樓梯）祇要我們不斷的抵抗，最後的勝利，到底是屬於公理這方面的。</p>
<p>機要秘書：對了，你所說的，正是政府長期抵抗的意思。現在的進行停戰，也無失是進一步的長期抵抗。</p>
<p>校長：（見軍事當局起立。）對不起，躭擱你的要公了。</p>
<p>軍事當局：没有什麽，請坐。···有什麽事？</p>
<p>校長：就是關於停戰的事，我要請敎請敎。近來，一般的學生對於這次停戰，非常抱憤。說是這樣的直接交涉，未免太示弱了。他們都是年輕的人，不懂得國家大勢，處處總是對政府責難。所以我想在這裏知道一些關於停戰的重大意義，以便回去開　　們。</p>
<p>軍事當局：關於這次停戰的意義，我想每一個中國國民都應該明白；中國現在這樣民窮財盡，還能禁得起長年戰爭嗎？這是第一點。第二，江西湖南······等地，共匪猖獗，擾害國家，簡直是政府的心腹之患，所以我們估計輕重，非先安內不足以攘外。第三，中國的兵器戰具，過於落後，這是非常主要的。難道大刀隊可以擋得住飛機大砲嗎？你不知道戰塲上的情形，據說是坦克車排山倒海似的滾過來，我們的陣地，就完全失了作用。第四點，大槪我不說你也知道。就是說我們的作戰力量不能平衡。因爲他們都要保全實力。譬如說上月敵人將攻南天門，事先便爲我軍所覺察，於是特令某部進攻沽源，向灤平大道方面，鈔襲敵人右翼，誰知那部隊的將領却違抗命令，托辭不進，到後來南天門，晝夜大戰，犧牲得一塌糊塗。不獨是這樣，有些步隊簡直是藉抗日爲名，實際上是要擴充兵力。譬如西北軍某部，並没有奉着中央的命，便知動，從晋南開來。這是什麽用意呢？誰也知道是爲了奪地盤。旣然來了，那末中央從來是寬大爲懷，當然不不便擱阻。現在駐紥定州，號稱兩師，實際上祗有四千餘人，二千八百來枝雜槍。於是我們將他改編補充，命令他開往灤東參戰。可是他們却藉此機會要脅軍餉。本來當改編的時候，只說月餉三萬三千，到後來却說要十六萬元一月，否則便按兵不動。你看，這樣的情形，敎我們中央軍多少爲難？難是我們就全是傻瓜嗎？這樣的事，給敵人知道，眞是連肚皮也要笑痛了。</p>
<p>校長：是呀，有多少老百姓就爲了這種情形氣死了。</p>
<p>軍事當局：所以呀，我們爲了給百姓打算，也就不能不停戰了。這些苦衷，這要請先生轉告國人。</p>

<h3>珂玲穆亞的重返銀幕</h3>
<p>— 赫爾</p>
<p>默片時代的第一號紅星</p>
<p>四年遊蕩之後再求工作</p>
<p>珂玲穆亞Colleen　Moore的名字，大慨我們都不容易忘記的吧。雖然她已離開了影界好幾年了，但是我們的聽見了她的名字，還覺得非常的興奮。她非但是默片時代的最紅的明星，她特别緊繫在我們中國人心弦的地方，就是因爲她那瓜子式的臉形，配上烏黑光潤的頭髮，齊眉一剪，宛如一位時髦的中國小姑娘，所以中國的觀衆，爲她所傾倒的，當然不在少數了。</p>
<p>在默片時代，珂玲穆亞，是薪水最大的一位明星。在一九二九年她自影界告退的時候，她已積聚了百萬的家私，有人說不止一百萬，有三百萬之多。那時她祇有二十七歲。她因爲她腰纏的富足，於是就想享受一下子自由的生活，她就各處遊蕩了四年。在這四年之中，她想盡各種方法，去消磨她的光陰，尋求那除了電影之外，别的表現她的天才的門徑。她請了名師學了油畫和彫刻。不成功，又去學音樂。因爲她從前未進影界的時候，曾經學過鋼琴，她以爲這次必定可以成功了。但是結果她還是不能安定她的心。結果她明白了，除了影戲之外，她没有别的出路；除了工作之外，亦没有别的求快樂的方法。於是她就毅然决然回好萊塢了。這是去年的事。</p>
<p>米高梅公司，聽見珂玲穆亞回來，就和她訂了長期合同。但是一年以來，討論過多少脚本，都没有與她身份適合的，所以遲遲没有工作。這在米高梅方面，雖然審愼將事，不得不如此，但珂玲穆亞是抱了一肚皮的熱望而來的，並且她所需要的是工作，不是金錢，所以一年以來的閑置，使她精神上，受了莫大的痛苦。幸虧後來福斯公司看她没有事做，將她借了去，演了一齣戲，呌做The　Power　and　the　Glory　o自從這張片子成功了之後，好萊塢已曉得珂玲穆亞的表演才能，並没有因爲四年的閑散而退步；次之，她現在已是三十以外的婦人，她的作品改變了，很適合於扮演中年婦人的身份。</p>
<p>珂玲穆亞表演的才能，是無可疑異的，那種輕倩生動的姿勢，和細膩熨貼的表情，在默片時代，可以說是出神入化的了，可惜的是，她和曼利璧克福，李玲吉舒等等，一樣遭受聲片突然分侵襲的打擊，而使她不得不自己放自己的假。凡看過她「丁香處處開」Lilac　Time，裘暖花香Orchids　and　Ermine等片的，都替她抱無窮的遺憾，祇看她表演的神情，多末細緻，而一到開口歌唱的時候，又多末使人失望。當然在聲片初期時代，一切收音的技巧，有許多缺陷。現在一切都進步了，可以彌補這種發音上的缺憾。但是，我們又想到那頭髮烏黑光潤，面龐圓圓的小姑娘，已經不可復見了；四年工夫的變遷，令人興多少滄桑之感呀！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「海角佳偶」“Her　First　Mate”</h3>
<p>— 白</p>
<p>－國泰映－</p>
<p>假使我們確切的認定了電影是敎育民衆的工具之一的話，那末，這劇的演出，我個人認爲它不但没有相當的盡了它的使命，而且是浪費的。</p>
<p>事實上歐美的電影界，也眞臨到了没落的前夜。由於劇本的缺乏，處處東拉西凑的只拿些迎合某部份低級心理的題材來充數。不是用女人的「色」「肉」來麻醉欺騙，就是什麽滑稽啦！奇險啦！這一類來博觀衆的一粲。現在這「海角佳耦」一片，無疑的，就是在這種紊亂和濫製的狀態中產生的，雖然它裏面不是像往常一般的那樣萬花撩亂！</p>
<p>在這兒！我們得首先說明這故事的内容，它是描寫着一個航海家之子約翰好納，被環境所迫，不能承繼父業。因此歷盡艱險，後得其妻的資助，纔得爲一渡輪之主。編劇者的主旨，很明顯的，他是想描寫夫妻的愛共同生活的眞實的愛，所以故事的結束，用了一個喜劇的形式。但是，反正，我認爲這一點，也正是這個戲的錯誤所在。我們得知道，在這個社會裏頭，像故事中的主人翁那樣行爲是儘多着，電影編劇者不嚴格地去糾正，而加以可喜的贊揚，是很不該的。從畫面中告訴我們的那個約翰好納，雖然編劇者想把他寫成一個富有上進思想的人物，但實際上，他僅是一個實足道地的庸人，他爲誇耀於他的妻子，竟欺騙地自稱爲大副。自想買帆船，又硬要妻子的錢，這不是很明白地昭示了我們一個無用的男子是什麽？而結果竟來上這麽幾個塲面，我想，這種觀念，實在有些不敢接受｜至少這對於社會是不會有良好貢獻的。</p>
<p>演出方面，也没有多大成績。導演者的手術平平。不過這個戲，前面說過，他不是像一般的那樣萬花撩亂，而用幽默的方法來演出，這該是可喜的。演員都很忠實。女主角Zasu　Pitts是可說成功的。其餘的實在這種劇情的支配之下，很少發展的機會。</p>
<p>所以這個片子，除了取材，比較有些眞實性以外，大體上說，是很平凡的。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>明日黃花評「母性之光」</h3>
<p>— 莫奈何</p>
<p>「母性之光」雖己明日黃花，可仍有一評的價値。爲了該作品的藝術價値的高深，故不嫌煩屑，寫點意見出來。</p>
<p>大體上，這是篇價値高昻的作品。因筆者對於該作品太欽佩了，因是找出兩點，供獻出來：</p>
<p>第一點，即是家瑚的從南洋歸來，遇見前妻慧英，稱呼她爲「林太太」，似乎有點兒酸味作用。一個胸前背後受到了礦主的皮鞭賜與，而同時更明白點兒關於這個社會，且以前有過實際的革命工作，這酸味作用該没有的。當家瑚稱呼她「林太太」時，觀衆們有的發出一種嘲諷的笑聲，這笑聲，損害了這位母親之「光」了。</p>
<p>再一點：當母親正在悲哀之際，三位滑稽明星的驟然出現，觀衆們見他們活稽，便哄然了。這一點是分散了觀衆正在被組織成了的情緒。</p>
<p>末了，見到慧英跟家瑚在外邊兒散步，被小梅見了，而小梅跟書麟正在熱情興奮中被母親呌了去責備她時，她說出「娘爲什麽跟鄒先生來往」時，一班觀衆們笑了出來，認爲這句話說得很好。我感到咱們中國的文化水準畢竟還很低落，因以感到電影在這個時代，該多麽地重要，要負起一種提倡大衆文化水準的担子來呢。</p>
<p>所感如此，便塗了下來。</p>

<h3>鏡花水月Three-Cornered　Moon（三）</h3>
<p>— 波倫</p>
<p>林柏加太太擺出了她因親的架子道：「孩子們，你們不要興奮得太過份了，不然是要得神經錯亂的毛病的。還有一樣，你們要坐下來，因爲坐着的思想總比站着的思想好得多。」伊麗莎白歎了一口長氣。肯納聽說他是學法律的，他應當對他母親查問一下。「母親，那些股票，你是什麽時候買的？」林柏加太太將她肥笨的身體坐直了，她說：「這事說來怪長的。剩了我一個人，照顧你們這許多孩子，我想着要設法多弄些錢，使你們將來快樂些，所以我就拿了七萬五千塊錢去買了些股票。」伊麗莎白橋舌驚喊“「七萬五十塊錢。」林柏加太太又繼續着說道：「後來又添了五萬。我並不傻，因爲有人告訴我，那是一位很好的好人，他說水月公司的股票最好。一肯納斯道：「什麽水月公司？」林柏加太太摸着她的頭道：「讓我想想看······那大槪係個鑛公司，或是一種金屬的鑛······我想那個人是很漂亮的，嘴唇上有些小鬍子。他告訴我水月公司的股票很有希望的。」伊麗莎白插嘴問道：「那個人的名字呌什麽？」林柏加太太道：「讓我想想看，這個名字剛才還在我舌尖上的，怎麽一時就忘了。他的第一個名字是Ｓ起頭的，唔，Ｓilver，不對，不是的。」肯納斯着急道「不管他什麽名字吧。以後怎麽樣呢？」林柏加太太道：「起初是很好的。後來慢慢地跌下去了。我想她會起來的。後來果然起來了，不過後來又跌了，後來又起來了。我想這回不會再跌了。誰知我想的對，她又跌了，跌了就再不爬起來了。一直到一個禮拜之前，勃立治先生······現在想起來了，他的名字呌勃立治先生，他呌我再放些錢進去。我又給了他些錢，好些錢。今天早晨他又呌我放錢進去，但是銀行裏的錢，已經支空了。」四個孩子一齊問道「那就怎麽樣的呢？」林柏加太太道：「那還怎麽樣呢？」我又不是一個小孩子，所以我就呌了一輛汽車，回到家裡來洗頭了。」</p>
<p>伊麗莎白歎了一口氣，坐在沙發上，兩隻手捧了她的頭。三個孩子一個一個的，都坐了下來。大家默然無聲。林柏加太太很安閑地煽着扇子，樓梯儘上層龍那德的房裡，打字機的逹的逹地響着。伊麗莎白忽然想起了斯提芬醫生，他是一位足智多謀的人，他着於替人家出主意。凡遇見了意外的人，祇要有他在旁邊，天大的事都不怕了。「你没有錢之後，怎樣辦呢？」這是她想請問斯提芬的問題。多末省事呀，請都不用請，他自己來了。伊麗莎白很清楚地已聽見了他的脚步聲。肯納斯第一個開口道：「醫生，我們的錢全完了。母親聽了一個不相識的人的話，把錢完全喪失了！」伊麗莎白聽見了，勃然地跳了起來道：「你說這種話，難道這是母親一個人的錯嗎？我們不是全都是成人嗎，爲什麽我們不早知道母親的脾氣而防她一步呢？」（未完）</p>

<h3>Japanese Army Warning Deadline Expires, Fang and Ji's Troops Move South</h3>
<p>One Route Towards Sanhe, Another Towards Gaoliying</p>
<p>May Flee into Luandong and Join Bandits</p>
<p>Japanese Sources Report Contact North of Gaoliying</p>
<p>Colonel Yoshida Meets with Ji Hongchang et al. in Miyun</p>
<p>(Beiping) Military News, Shunyi Telegram, Fang's troops stationed at Niulanshan departed in two directions at 2:00 AM this morning, one eastward and one southward. The eastern contingent is heading towards Sanhe County, while the southern contingent is heading towards Gaoliyingzi. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The 32nd Regiment of the Japanese Army in Miyun is scheduled to move towards Huairou tomorrow morning. Today, the Japanese field warehouse was moved from Gubeikou to Miyun. Ji's troops are concentrated outside Huairou City. Gaoliying was originally garrisoned by Zhao Xizeng's company of the 32nd Army. Yesterday, Zhao's troops were ordered to change defense, and Zhao Jingmin's regiment of the Zhou Division was transferred to fill the position. Fang Zhenwu sent spies to Gaoliying for reconnaissance. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Kwantung Army previously warned Fang Zhenwu to withdraw all troops from the demilitarized zone by the 26th. The deadline expired tonight. Fang replied to the Kwantung Army with some explanations, but the Japanese side insisted on its original grounds. The Chief of Staff of the 8th Division telegraphed Fang's original telegram to the Japanese Embassy in Peiping, stating that it was impossible to tolerate the other party's violation of the truce agreement and decided to expel them upon the expiration of the deadline. This has been conveyed to our side by Shibayama. However, our side expressed its inability to accept the Japanese military's method of sending troops to the war zone again to drive out Fang and Ji's troops. A portion of the Japanese army has arrived in Miyun. In addition to ordering the frontline troops to strictly guard the border of the demilitarized zone against Fang's troops, the authorities and all parties are quite calm. It is expected that the resolution of Fang and Ji's troops will not develop into a major problem. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) At 10:30 AM this morning, three Japanese planes flew over Gaoliying, circling low. The people in Gaoliying fled. The 4th Division of Ji's troops in Huairou is also moving towards Gaoliying, and the situation is quite tense. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Fang and Ji's troops moved in two directions, southeast, this morning. Because we have strict precautions, it is extremely difficult to flee south. As a result, they will flee east along the so-called demilitarized zone boundary, in order to unite with the bandit gangs in Luandong, such as Lao Haozi, to carry out some major conspiracy. However, the Japanese side repeatedly stated that they have absolutely no relationship with Fang and Ji's troops. This afternoon, Japanese planes came to Peiping again, scattering leaflets addressed to the Chinese military authorities, officials, and civilians, warning Fang's troops to withdraw as scheduled, or they would be attacked. The authorities are optimistic about this issue, believing that Fang's strength is weak. If there is no other background, it will not be difficult to resolve. The key to all problems in northern Peiping and Luandong still lies in a diplomatic solution. After Huang Fu returns to Peiping and someone is responsible, he can contact the Japanese side, and it should not be expanded too much. The Japanese warning deadline for Ji's troops to withdraw expires tonight, and the true attitude of the Japanese side will be revealed. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Fang and Ji Actively Prepare to Flee South</h3>

Wang Zhongfu's troops moved towards Zhanggezhuang and Yanggezhuang, southeast of Huairou, intending to spy on Sanhe. Fang's plainclothes troops burned, killed, and looted more than ten miles outside Shunyi City.

<h3>Japanese Side Transmits Report of Outpost Clashes</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Fang Zhenwu's Allied Army continued to move south today before the deadline for withdrawal from the demilitarized zone, gradually approaching the Central Army centered on Shunyi. Outpost clashes occurred north of Gaoliying last night. Because of the urgent situation, He Yingqin urgently transferred about two regiments of the 130th Division of Wan Fulin's troops stationed in Shahe on the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway to reinforce and guard north of Shunyi and south of Shijiazhuang. (26th Dentsu Telegram)</p>

(26th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>Fang and Ji Seem to Lack Any Long-Term Plans</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain important person observed that Fang and Ji's recent actions are a kind of short-sighted political maneuver, lacking any long-term plans. Their intention seems to be to use the protection of the Tanggu Truce to extend their precarious existence and further coerce the central government to give them a more favorable position. It seems that they have no collusion with the Japanese side. As for the Japanese side, they naturally welcome this opportunity, which can create a serious situation so that they can induce our country to begin political negotiations with them. The central government believes that this is a local incident and ordered the Peiping Military Branch to resolve it with political means based on the central government's established policy. If Fang and Ji can submit, then the Japanese side will lose the pretext upon which to rely. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Army Decides to Bomb Fang and Ji</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) Fang and Ji's army's offensive and the Eastern Asia Allied Army in Luandong have begun to operate, thus disrupting the security within the scope of the ceasefire agreement.

On the one hand, regarding the situation in Luandong, the Japanese army stationed in Peiping will protect everything. If traffic on the Peiping-Shenyang Railway is hindered, and the lives and property of Japanese residents are endangered, they will also take decisive action, otherwise, they will temporarily adopt an attitude of bystanders and watch the development of the situation. (26th Domei News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Discusses the Fang and Ji Incident</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Shaoxiong said, "The Fang and Ji incident in North China had not yet occurred when I left Peiping. I have not received any telegrams from anywhere after arriving in Nanjing, so I have not been able to understand the inside story. As of now, the central government has not received a report from Minister He, so it is impossible to determine the handling methods. Generally, Minister He will handle it as he sees fit. As for the Japanese side's request to send troops to encircle and suppress them, it has now been rejected to avoid misunderstandings. However, the question of which side will send troops to suppress them in the future is still being discussed. Chairman Huang Fu will return to Peiping in one or two days to preside over the affairs of the committee." (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japan Publicly Proclaims Strict Adherence to Truce Agreement to the International Community</h3>
<p>Foreign Ministry Telegram to Overseas Ambassadors</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Fang Zhenwu and other armies of the Feng Yuxiang faction, using the pretext of opposing Japan and resisting Japan, have begun military operations in North China. Because the Chinese side is carrying out anti-Japanese propaganda at the current League of Nations General Assembly and to the United Kingdom and the United States, there is a fear of falsely accusing the Japanese army. Therefore, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically telegraphed Matsudaira, the ambassador to the United Kingdom, major ambassadors stationed abroad, and Ito, the Deputy Director of the Imperial Affairs Bureau in Geneva, to express the following imperial attitude in order to prevent misunderstandings in various countries:</p>
<p>1. Japan's attitude toward Fang Zhenwu's army and other miscellaneous armies is to strictly abide by the truce agreement. If the miscellaneous Chinese armies invade the agreement area, Japan will certainly repel them.</p>
<p>2. Fang Zhenwu's army of the Feng faction, since Feng stepped down, has roamed in the Zhangjiakou and Chahar areas. During the Rehe War, they contacted the armies of Tang Yulin, Liu Guitang, and Li Shouxin, etc., who were expelled from Hebei and Rehe, and called themselves the East Asia Republican Army. On the surface, they loudly advocated opposition to Japan and moved south along the Peiping-Suiyuan Railway from the Rehe Province border. Their number is only a small unit of 2,000.</p>
<p>3. These troops appeared in Huairou on the 20th of this month and have a gradual tendency to move south.</p>
<p>4. He Yingqin intends to suppress these types of troops and has ordered the Central Army in Hebei Province to defend them. (26th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<h3>He Jian Orders General Suppression</h3>
<p>Wang and Peng's Divisions Report Victory</p>
<p>(Hankou) After He Jian arrived in Pingxiang, he ordered a general suppression of the Red bandits. Wang Dongyuan and Peng Weiren's divisions fought bloody battles with the bandit army for two days and nights in Lianhua Dongmapu on the 23rd and 24th, killing 2,500 bandits and seizing more than 1,000 guns. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>

(26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(Nanchang) After He Jian, Commander-in-Chief of the Western Route, arrived in Pingxiang, he instructed his subordinates to pay attention to the following points during the suppression of the remaining bandits: (1) Diligently seek the people's concerns; (2) Promote public administration; (3) Practice frugality; (4) Protect good officials; (5) Be realistic and pragmatic. (26th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japanese Soldiers Run Amok in Tanggu</h3>
<p>Opening Fire in the Streets to Drive Away Police Officers</p>
<p>Japanese Soldiers Returned to Camp Only After Negotiations</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Three Japanese soldiers stationed in Tanggu created trouble in the streets on the 26th night. When the police tried to stop them, they refused to obey and summoned a large number of Japanese soldiers who beat and drove away the police officers. The matter was resolved through mediation. At 5:00 PM on the 26th, a large group of Japanese soldiers opened fire in the streets to drive away the police officers. Japanese soldiers stood guard, which was resolved through negotiation. At 8:00 PM, the Japanese soldiers returned to camp. The people were greatly frightened. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army in Tanggu suddenly notified our side's railway protection team stationed at Tanggu Station at 5:00 AM this morning, saying that Tanggu's security did not need to be maintained by our side and forced our railway protection team to withdraw. They were forced to withdraw from Tanggu at 7:00 AM this morning. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhongdian Has Been Recovered</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Long Yun's representative Li Peitian officially stated, "Received a telegram from Yunnan stating that Zhongdian was recovered on the 24th night. More than 3,000 bandits were killed, over 900 were killed, and over 500 were captured alive. More than 600 guns and horses were seized. Our army also suffered more than 400 casualties due to the lack of artillery. Except for several dozen ringleaders, the rest of those captured alive were released leniently."

<h3>Japanese Planes Demonstrate Again in Peiping</h3>
<p>Passing Through Huairou, Shunyi, and Other Places</p>
<p>Distributing Leaflets Warning Residents</p>
<p>Expressing the Determination to Expel Fang's Army</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese planes reconnoitered over Peiping again this afternoon. There were a total of four, all large, gray, two-winged aircraft. They circled over Peiping for about ten minutes and scattered many leaflets. The original text read: "We have recently heard that a Chinese named Fang Zhenwu, harboring異志 (dissident ambitions), led a large army into the demilitarized zone that Chinese troops are not allowed to enter and is inflicting pain on the local people. We are also considering attacking them, which our Japanese army deeply believes is correct. Because the area entered by Fang's army is located north of the southern line of the truce agreement, our Great Japanese Army is willing to take the trouble to expel them. Now, this method of ours is entirely to respect the truce agreement, and there is not the slightest other intention involved. We hereby solemnly declare that if our army engages Fang's army in battle, the local people will suffer. Although our Great Japanese Commander will never interfere in the mutual conflicts of the Chinese people, our army, with a just and upright position, respects the truce agreement and now demands that Fang's army, which is in an area that Chinese troops are not allowed to enter, withdraw. If they refuse to withdraw, our army will resolutely attack them and now has the determination and preparation. We find that Fang is resisting the national government, and the Chinese army is suffering considerable damage because of this behavior. The commanders of this force think of this and are 心如熱水煎 (as if their hearts are boiled in hot water) and 苦楚萬狀 (filled with suffering). If local officials and civilians unite and expel Fang Zhenwu to the south of the demilitarized agreement zone, that would be extremely fortunate. The fact that our small army unit is stationed in Miyun County City and that area is spared from this disaster is especially gratifying. You must know that the speed of our army's combat preparation is so fast that everything can be completed immediately with the transportation of everything by many cars. We are afraid that you are not fully aware of this. Cut, cut, this announcement, Commander of the Great Japanese Army, September, Showa 8 (1933)". (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Three Japanese planes reconnoitered the movements of Fang and other Allied armies in Shunyi this morning. At noon, they flew to the skies above Peiping, dropped a communication tube, and then flew north after circling for about twenty minutes. (26th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The deadline for the Japanese army to order Fang Zhenwu to withdraw is approaching this evening.

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>American Cotton and National Cotton</h3>
<p>This time, the US$50 million American cotton and wheat loan stipulates that four-fifths will be used to purchase cotton and one-fifth to purchase wheat. This cotton and wheat are agricultural products for which China is currently experiencing a price drop. Among them, cotton is the only raw material for China's national industry yarn factories. Therefore, the impact will naturally have a great relationship with the national livelihood issue.</p>
<p>In the past year, the price of American cotton has fallen to around four cents, setting a new low record in nearly a hundred years. At the beginning of this loan, the authorities originally intended to take advantage of this low price to absorb a large amount of raw materials to develop China's cotton industry. However, based on the facts of today, it is definitely not what the authorities expected. Since Roosevelt took office, he has refused monetary agreements externally and implemented currency inflation internally. In just a few months, general prices have risen by more than double. Even considering the recent price of American cotton, it has reached about one dime. And American farmers in the South are still demanding higher cotton prices. Therefore, the former cotton price of four or five cents is probably no longer available today. Secondly, the intention of China to borrow cotton and wheat may be due to the large amount of cotton and wheat imported in the previous year. It is assumed that there will be the same amount of imports in the future. Therefore, it is thought that it is better to borrow on credit than to buy with cash. The intention is not wrong. However, the actual situation is different. The large import of cotton and wheat in the previous year was a unique phenomenon after China's great flood. And although the number of American cotton imported each year is quite large, most of it is consumed by foreign-owned factories in China. Among them, Japanese factories consume the most. Looking at these facts, this US$50 million cotton and wheat loan is worthy of research on the interests of China itself.</p>
<p>The first batch of cotton will soon be shipped from the west coast of the Pacific. When this first batch of cotton is about to arrive in port, the authorities must have pre-determined methods of control and management for the sake of national interest and the people's livelihood. And we especially hope that this method of control and management can be practical, appropriate, and beneficial to the people's livelihood.</p>
<p>Today, anyone with a little insight knows that the day American cotton arrives in port is the time when the price of national cotton will plummet. This can also be said to be an inevitable phenomenon in the future based on the principle of supply and demand in economics. After the price of Chinese national cotton plummets, the cotton farmers who will be directly and adversely affected will be most of them. The misfortune of harming farmers due to cheap grain last year is an example. Secondly, after the national cotton price plummets, the Japanese will definitely rise up and absorb a large amount of Chinese cotton to compensate for the loss of resisting Indian cotton after the abrogation of the Japan-India trade treaty and to use it as a tool to manipulate the price of Chinese cotton in the future. On the yarn factory side in our country, after being affected by the plummeting of national cotton, the yarn price must become lower and lower, then the foundation of our yarn factories will also 形搖動 (be shaken). Based on the actual situation, it is difficult for Hua factories to consume this US$40 million of cotton. As a result, most of it will fall into the hands of foreign factories in China and strengthen their competitiveness against our yarn factories invisibly.</p>
<p>Therefore, before this American cotton arrives in port, appropriate control methods must be planned in advance. The government, yarn factories, and financial circles should work together as soon as possible to save the crisis of the yarn factories' future and avoid increasing the suffering of the people in the future. We borrow chopsticks to plan, the first step should be taken by the yarn factories and the government to maintain the price of Chinese national cotton, so as not to fall due to the arrival of American cotton. Only then can Chinese cotton farmers be slightly spared from innocent disasters and reduce the covetous hearts of foreign merchants. The second step should be taken by the government and the financial community to raise funds to stockpile American cotton, on the one hand, so that American cotton will not disrupt the market of Chinese national cotton, and on the other hand, to reduce the power of foreign factories to manipulate and oppress. In short, this issue is very important today. It is not too late to mend the fold after a sheep has been lost. We dare to contribute our own views. If the parties concerned can pay attention to it, it will not only be the fortune of cotton farmers and yarn factories.</p>
<h3>The Hopei Peace Preservation Corps Prepares to Counterattack Funing</h3>
<p>Su Yukun Ordered to Proceed to Yuguan</p>
<p>Negotiating with the Japanese Regarding Bandit Suppression Matters</p>
<p>Changli Under Strict Guard</p>
<p>Liu Xingpei Arrives in Tianjin to Report the Loss of the City</p>
<p>(Beiping) The notorious bandit leader of Luandong, "Old Mouse," led his forces to besiege Funing County. On the 24th, they bombarded the city, causing severe damage to civilian houses. Our Peace Preservation Corps resisted. Suddenly, a Japanese man named Kunihiro Ryokichi, claiming to be the captain of the "Manchukuo" border police, led cavalry to demand entry into the city to protect County Magistrate Liu Xingpei. The city gates were opened, and bandit troops gradually entered the city, occupied civilian residences, and engaged in rampant looting. Liu and Public Security Bureau Chief Wu Jinrong retreated to Changli Railway Station that night. Refugees fled in droves. Liu, Wu, and other county government officials arrived in Tianjin last night to report the fall of the county to Yu Xuezhong. Yu telegraphed He Yingqin and Yin Tong in Beiping yesterday afternoon, and stated that it had been determined that the "Manchukuo" police captain who demanded entry into the city was not Japanese. Yin Tong, acting on He's orders, telegraphed Su Yukun, the special commissioner stationed in Tianjin for negotiations, to meet with Yu this afternoon. Our side has decided to dispatch the Peace Preservation Corps to counterattack, and ordered Su Yukun to proceed to Yuguan immediately to negotiate with the Japanese regarding our bandit suppression efforts. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A person from Yuguan reported that the "Old Mouse" bandit gang is entrenched in Liushouying, Qinhuangdao, Beidaihe, and other places, looting and harassing the population. They extorted a large sum of money from the Qinhuangdao Chamber of Commerce. The Chamber of Commerce raised and handed over 30,000 yuan, but the bandits continued their disturbances. Many civilians fled to Tianjin for refuge. Bandits were rampant near Yuguan. A small number even infiltrated the city and carried out looting, but were driven out by the local self-defense corps. Rumors were rampant in Yuguan, and people were restless. The "Old Mouse" bandit leader has led the majority of his forces across Yutian, heading towards Sanhe, attempting to move west to Shunyi and join forces with Fang Jun. The people of Changli, Funing, Sanhe, and other counties are living in misery. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>In Changli, there was heavy rain on the night of the 25th, and the situation eased slightly. It became slightly tense again after 8:00 AM on the 26th, but then returned to normal. It is reported that the vanguard of the bandit forces is stationed in the area near Liushouying. Our police force is guarding along the Changli border. However, a detachment of about 200 scattered bandits has already circled to the northwest of Changli, in the area east of Lulong, observing the bandit situation and still attempting to connect with Yutian. However, the source of the trouble is definitely in Qinhuangdao, so the situation is not optimistic, but there is no need to be pessimistic in the face of events, because the Second Peace Preservation Corps will arrive in Changli to reinforce us, so morale is very high, and we will take the opportunity to take Funing city in one fell swoop. Currently, since the city was lost, half of the civilians have not been able to escape, and the bandit forces are committing adultery, looting, and all kinds of atrocities everywhere, so cases of hanging and drowning are endless. The puppet County Magistrate Zu Guoqin has been actively recruiting local ruffians since Liu left the city. After County Magistrate Liu arrived in Changli, he was at headquarters for a time, but did not return on the night of the 25th for some reason. On the 26th, he received an order from the province to be transferred back to Tianjin. Changli has been quite panicked for days due to the loss of Funing City. Unscrupulous elements took the opportunity to spread rumors, so the situation in the streets is bleak, with few businesses open. In the afternoon, the county government convened a joint meeting of local gentry, and Corps Commander Dou made a special trip to participate, clearly stating his position on the spot and expressing his determination to absolutely maintain Changli, hoping that all sectors would live in peace and not disturb each other. Therefore, people's hearts have gradually settled down. Many people have visited Dou in recent days. An American pastor visited on the 25th, and Dou explained that he was determined to maintain order with all his strength, ensuring that there would be no danger. On the morning of the 26th, Kawai, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Luanzhou, also came to Changli to inspect the streets and four gates, and then asked Dou many questions. He reported to Qin Fang based on what he was told. In the afternoon, Li Jichun sent personnel to Changli to inquire about the bandit suppression situation. As of midnight, there were no major changes in any direction, but the dangerous situation remained. The refugees who came to Changli have been taken in by all sectors in the newly established Women and Children Relief Association. It is heard that more than thirty infants have drowned along the way. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Su Yuqi, the representative sent by Yin Tong to Changchun for negotiations, arrived in Tianjin from Beiping at 7:30 PM on the 15th. He first met with Nakamura, the Japanese commander stationed in Tianjin, and then went to Yuguan to meet with Ochi-gawa, the garrison commander, to ask them not to interfere in the bandit suppression. If successful, Yu Xuezhong will increase the number of Peace Preservation Corps by 2,000 to vigorously suppress bandits in Luandong. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Funing County Magistrate Liu Xingpei, along with Public Security Bureau Chief Wu Jinrong, Education Bureau Chief Zheng Buyuan, Finance Bureau Chief Zhao Xingren, Construction Bureau Chief Sun Xuewen, and the seals and important files, arrived in Tianjin on the morning of the 26th and set up a temporary office at the Qiyun Hotel. At 10:00 AM, Liu and the four bureau chiefs visited Provincial Chairman Yu Xuezhong to report on the loss of the city and asked to be punished. Liu told reporters that the bandits who attacked Funing numbered only one or two thousand. Japanese and Korean ruffians secretly provided military fire. If it were not for the restraint of harming valued objects, they would be easily defeated. He is quietly awaiting Chairman Yu's orders. If he can send police to suppress bandits, he is willing to volunteer. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Bandits were discovered outside Changli City on the evening of the 26th, and the situation is serious. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The traitor Hao Peng was protected by the Japanese some days ago and went to Changchun via Dalian to engage in activities. Qinhuangdao, Liushouying, Haiyangzhen, Yuguanzhen, Taitouying, and other places are filled with bandits, and the people are suffering. The situation in Changli is critical, and a special curfew was imposed on the 25th. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Sources in the transportation sector report that it is not that the Luandong Peace Preservation Corps and the defense corps are incapable of suppressing bandits, but that every time they encircle and suppress them, just when they are about to succeed, they are constrained by the fear of harming valued objects, so there is no way to do it. The bandits are therefore gathering more and more. This time, more than twenty heavy trucks loaded military fire from Shijiazhuang to Funing to supply the bandits. After County Magistrate Liu Xingpei received assistance from the Tangshan Peace Preservation Corps, he repelled the bandits besieging the east, south, and west sides of the city on the evening of the 22nd. The bandits on the north side were also about to be captured, but the bandits obtained powerful reinforcements and returned on the morning of the 24th, reoccupying Zijin Mountain and firing more than fifty cannons into the city. The firing was extremely accurate. County Magistrate Liu Xingpei retreated to Changli at 10:00 PM on the 24th, along with Peace Preservation Corps Commander Dou Xizhe, Public Security Bureau Chief Wu Jinrong, and others. The bandits then entered Funing, burning, looting, and raping, a truly unprecedented disaster. About 10,000 people risked their lives to escape to Changli, and more than 20,000 were unable to escape. On the 25th, local bullies and traitors organized an autonomous association and elected a puppet county magistrate. The bandit forces were divided into two routes and attacked Changli and Lulong. A thousand men from Shi Yousan's unit stationed in Yutian, a military headquarters, has dispatched Staff Officer Li to take roll call of them. It is heard that the unit is unstable and will respond to the "Old Mouse". According to an investigation by a certain party, Shi Yousan has not arrived in Tianjin, but only his partisans are unusually active in the Japanese concession, secretly organizing the East Asia Allied Army.

<h3>Huang Fu Will Soon Go North</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu telegraphed the Political Reorganization Committee, stating that he would leave Shanghai on the 28th to return north, stay in Nanjing briefly to visit Wang and ask for instructions on North China's diplomatic policy, and arrive in Beiping around the beginning of October.

<h3>North China's Finances Will Be Under the Direct Jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance</h3>
<p>The Finance Department of the Political Reorganization Committee Will Be Abolished</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Finance Department of the Political Reorganization Committee will be abolished, and North China's finances will be under the direct jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance. (25th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Guo Zhihan came to Beiping to meet with Wang Kemin to discuss the reorganization of North China's finances, and left Beiping this afternoon to return to Chahar. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Li Jichun Secretly Arrives in Beiping</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Li Jichun secretly arrived in Beiping last night from Luandong in disguise. He claimed to people that he was handling personal matters, and there is no fixed date for his departure from Beiping. However, it is generally speculated that Li's arrival may have other tasks.

<h3>Xiao Zhenying and Yue Jingtao Go from Zhangjiakou to Pangjiang</h3>
<p>To Console the Mongolian Banners</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from Zhangjiakou reports that Xiao Zhenying and Yue Jingtao, accompanied by more than ten guards, left for Pangjiang by car on the morning of the 26th to console the Mongolian banners. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Fu Zuoyi sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan, reporting in detail on the situation of the Mongolian princes holding a meeting at the Beile Temple. He also gave a detailed account of the Mongolian princes' plan to form an autonomous government, and requested instructions on how to eliminate the problem. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Bulian of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission and Mongolian personnel are studying the issue of Inner Mongolian autonomy. They all said that Gu Wang and the league leaders of the western leagues telegraphed to solicit the opinions of Mongolian personnel in Beiping and hoped that they would go to participate in the meeting. This is enough to show that their motives are purely open and there is no secret behavior. Furthermore, before the Mongolian princes announced Inner Mongolian autonomy, they reported to the central government and requested guidance. This shows that although the Mongolian princes announced autonomy, they still obeyed the central government. Under these circumstances, the central authorities must understand the intentions of the Mongolian princes, seek to adapt to the needs of the environment, and quickly send personnel to Inner Mongolia to convey their intentions. Some advocated that Bai Yunti should go first, but the result has not been decided. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>The Hopei Provincial Government Requests Allocation of Cotton and Wheat Loans</h3>

<h3>The Japanese Claim to Be Rotating Troops, But Secretly Reinforce Troops in Tianjin and Beiping</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The Japanese claimed to be rotating troops, but secretly reinforced troops in Tianjin and Beiping. At 3:00 PM on the 25th, a company from the Asahikawa Division arrived in Tianjin, bringing 400-500 large wooden boxes, which will be transferred to Beiping within a few days.

<h3>Chaisaki Visits He to Express the Japanese Attitude</h3>
<p>Denies Collusion with Fang Jixiang</p>
<p>The Japanese Army Prepares to Drive Out Fang's Troops</p>
<p>Preventing Fang Ji from Fleeing to Luandong</p>
<p>(Beiping) Chaisaki met with He Yingqin and stated that the Japanese army had not colluded with Fang Jixiang's army. The Japanese Kwantung Army will begin operations against Fang Jixiang's army entrenched in the Niulanshan area from the 27th, and will accommodate China's request to prevent them from fleeing to Luandong. The Kwantung Army will dispatch a large number of air squadrons to monitor the movements of Fang Jixiang's army in the Niulanshan and east of Huairou areas, and will use infantry to suppress and drive Fang Jixiang's army to attack in the southwest direction of the war zone, in order to seek a quick solution. The bandit army in Funing broke into the county seat, or posing as Japanese troops, to disturb the county seat. Chaisaki also guaranteed that no Japanese troops would enter the war zone. In the future, Chinese bandit suppression peace preservation teams may freely deal with bandit armies posing as Japanese troops. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese Embassy Chargé d'Affaires Nakayama visited He Yingqin this morning for half an hour. Li Zeyi hosted a banquet for Nakayama and Military Attaché Chaisaki this afternoon. He hosted a banquet for Japanese General Sakata and Chaisaki, Nakayama, and others tonight, inviting Lei Shourong, Yin Tong, Li Zeyi, and others to accompany them. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin replied to reporters in writing that Military Attaché Chaisaki came to see him some days ago and relayed the Kwantung Army's opinion, saying that the Kwantung Army's reply telegram had arrived in Beiping and fully understood the disposition of Fang's troops. However, if Fang's troops still raised the anti-Japanese banner and did not withdraw from the demilitarized zone within the time limit, the Kwantung Army would still attack them. However, our side cannot accept this approach because Huairou is Chinese territory, and we still ask Chaisaki to relay to the Kwantung Army that our side will handle the matter. If Fang flees to Tianjin and Beiping, we will of course resolve it. The bandit suppression in Luandong has been handed over to the War Zone Receiving Committee and the Hopei Provincial Government to be responsible for. There are rumors that Fang's troops are advancing into Shunyi and Tang's troops are advancing into Changping, but this is not true. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong said that he met with Chaisaki this afternoon. He received a telegram from the Kwantung Army expressing its acceptance of preventing Fang Jixiang's army from fleeing east, and will begin operations tomorrow to seek a quick solution to Fang Jixiang's army.</p>
<p>The Japanese army and Fang Jixiang's army have repeatedly stated that there is no collusion. A unit of the Japanese army has arrived in Miyun and will be transported by car. (26th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Chinese side of the North China regime claims that the current state of chaos is slanderous propaganda, saying that the recent disturbances in North China by the Japanese army instigating Fang Zhenwu, Ji Hongchang, and other bandits in North China is the first step in aggression. Military Attaché Chaisaki visited He Yingqin today and, based on the will of the Kwantung Army, said that this kind of slanderous propaganda insults the imperial army and has already been severe. Please seriously ban it, otherwise it will only make the situation in North China more chaotic. He immediately promised. (26th Den-tsu News Agency Telegram)</p>
<h3>Yan Huiqing Departs from Moscow</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Chinese Ambassador Yan Huiqing departed from Moscow tonight to Tashkent in Central Asia, and then to Xinjiang, to meet with Luo Wengan. Yan did not make a formal statement before his departure, but diplomatic circles here all believe that Luo and Yan will discuss all aspects of Sino-Russian relations, especially those related to Xinjiang.

<p>(Nanchang) Today, another spy of the bandit army was captured in Dujiapu. It turned out that a sentinel of the local defense corps saw a man dressed as a farmer and shouted for the password. The man turned around and fled, and jumped into the river to escape, but was still arrested on the opposite bank and immediately escorted to Nanchang for interrogation. Dujiapu is located on the only way to Nanchang-Xun Railway, with six railway bridges and one frame, so its position is very important. This is the second time a spy has been discovered.

<h3>League of Nations Assembly and Disarmament Talks</h3>
<p>Politicians from Various Countries Working on Two Fronts</p>
<p>Japan Dispatches Sato to Geneva</p>
<p>(Geneva) While the League of Nations Assembly is in session, politicians from various countries are discussing disarmament matters. British Foreign Secretary Simon visited Aloisi (Italy), Paul-Boncour (France), and Neurath (Germany) today. Disarmament issues were discussed during these meetings. French and German representatives have not yet engaged in direct talks. The Italian side seems willing to act as an intermediary. British circles hope that progress made in the next few days will allow concrete proposals to be submitted to the main body of the Disarmament Conference on October 15th. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Davis, the American representative to the Disarmament Conference, met with German Foreign Minister Neurath at dinner. Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Suvich and the country's representative to the League of Nations, Aloisi, also met with Neurath. The League of Nations Assembly held its second meeting in the afternoon and elected vice presidents. French Premier Daladier received 42 votes, with six votes mistakenly cast for French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour (as Paul-Boncour was not a candidate for re-election), which were also attributed to Daladier. German Foreign Minister Neurath received 40 votes, British Foreign Secretary Simon received 41 votes, and Persian Prince Foroughi received 39 votes. France's victory is considered settled. Committees were then organized. The German delegation requested that the issue of minority rights, listed on the agenda, be transferred to the Political Committee for consideration. This case will be discussed tomorrow. Germany has made it a habit to demand prompt public discussion of minority rights issues whenever the League of Nations convenes. The Chairman of the League of Nations Executive Council, Mowinckel, hosted a luncheon for his colleagues, but Paul-Boncour did not attend and was represented by Bérenger, the Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the French Senate. Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss met today with the Belgian Foreign Minister Hymans and the Dutch Foreign Minister de Graeff, and also arranged to meet with French Foreign Minister Paul-Boncour tomorrow. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Italian figures have already explored the German viewpoint on the principles proposed in the recent tripartite talks among Britain, France, and the United States in Paris. The intentions of Germany on this matter will soon be known to the governments of Britain, France, the United States, and Italy. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The non-permanent representatives of the League of Nations Executive Council from Guatemala, Ireland, and Norway are about to be re-elected. The Austrian government has probed the intentions of major European capitals, seemingly seeking to secure a seat. It is now heard that member states of the League of Nations have suggested to Britain that Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss be elected as one of the non-permanent representatives. Regarding the three vacancies for non-permanent representatives of the Executive Council, apart from Guatemala, which has been reserved for Latin American countries, Britain intends to propose Portugal and Australia as candidates for the other two seats. Although some have suggested to Britain that Portugal yield to Austrian Chancellor Dollfuss, Britain believes that if Dollfuss cannot remain in power for long, and Austrian politics fall into the hands of the National Socialist Party or a government based on National Socialism is established, this position of non-permanent representative will inevitably be transferred to a pro-German politician, resulting in a self-defeating outcome. Therefore, it does not support replacing Portugal with Austria. Thus, it is unlikely that the suggestion of Dollfuss as a candidate will be raised again in the near future. (Havas, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Japan is not sending a representative to the current session of the League of Nations Council in Geneva, adhering to its policy of withdrawing from the League and maintaining political isolation. However, since the current League of Nations meeting appointed a committee for technical cooperation with China, and the Chinese delegation intends to use this opportunity to request a report on the handling of Sino-Japanese issues, Japan feels the need for caution. It has decided to dispatch Ito Jushi, the Vice-Director of the Japanese League of Nations Bureau, and Yokoyama Masayuki, a Counselor at the Embassy in Belgium, to Geneva. The Japanese government has recently decided to additionally dispatch Ambassador Sato, the Japanese Plenipotentiary to the Disarmament Conference, to Geneva to monitor the situation from the sidelines. Sato departed from Brussels, Belgium, on the 24th and is expected to arrive in Geneva on the 26th. (Nichi-Ren, 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The warning issued by Norwegian Prime Minister Mowinckel about the pervasive possibility of war shocked the League of Nations Assembly, which opened today. Mowinckel, newly elected as Chairman of the League of Nations Executive Council, continued after issuing his warning, stating that the Four-Power Pact recently signed by Germany, Italy, France, and Britain could greatly contribute to the maintenance of order in Europe, but that freedom of thought and individual liberty were not sufficiently protected in various parts of Europe. (Reuters, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Assembly traditionally establishes six committees: (1) the Organization and Legal Matters Committee, (2) the Finance and Economics Committee, (3) the Disarmament Committee, (4) the Budget and Administration Committee, (5) the Humanitarian and Social Issues Committee, and (6) the Political Issues Committee. This year's Assembly, due to the ongoing Disarmament Conference, did not establish the third committee. Among the remaining five committees, two have already decided on their agendas today. The second committee, namely the Finance and Economics Committee, has elected the Belgian representative, Viénot, as Chairman and the Venezuelan representative, Parra, as Vice Chairman and has decided that the various issues related to the committee should be reviewed in the following order: (1) the work of industrial organization, (2) the work of transportation and transit organization, and (3) economic and financial work. In addition, the sixth committee, namely the Political Issues Committee, chaired by the Spanish representative, Madariaga, passed the following agenda: (1) the Nansen International Refugee Office, (2) the issue of slavery, (3) cooperation between newspapers and peace organizations, and (4) international intellectual cooperation. Apart from the meetings of the above committees, the representatives of the signatory countries of the Four-Power Pact engaged in extensive activities this morning, with Davis, the American representative to the Disarmament Conference, and Henderson, the Chairman of the Disarmament Conference, participating. Henderson plans to leave Geneva for a few days tomorrow and intends to facilitate informal meetings among the representatives of the countries most relevant to the disarmament issue before his departure, so that countries can reach a consensus on principles based on the draft disarmament treaty. However, it is reported that no concrete results have yet been achieved in this regard. (Havas, 26th)</p>

<h3>National Government Hires American Engineer to Assist in Road Construction Planning</h3>
<p>Glenn from New York State</p>
<p>A newspaper here in Albany reports reliable sources stating that the Chinese government has invited Glenn, a member of the New York State Public Works Commission, to China to oversee road construction. It is said that the Chinese government has raised substantial funds and plans to build 22,000 miles of new-style roads, hiring renowned road construction engineer Glenn to assist in road construction planning and oversee the works. When asked about this news today, Glenn declined to comment, leading many to believe that Glenn has indeed received an invitation from the Chinese government. Glenn first served as a member of the New York State Road Commission in 1919 and is currently engaged in a $40 million road construction project in this state. According to sources within the New York State Governor's office, if China does invite Glenn, he will be granted leave to go to China. However, sources within the office declined to confirm the authenticity of this news. Other sources have also stated that building 22,000 miles of roads would require hiring engineers for several years. (National News Agency, 25th)</p>

<p>Illegal Buying and Selling Negotiations Stalled</p>
<h3>Japanese Puppets Deliberately Disrupting the Administration of the Chinese Eastern Railway</h3>
<p>Key Russian Officials Continue to Be Arrested</p>
<p>Russian Consul-General in Harbin Lodges Another Protest</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Illegal negotiations regarding the Chinese Eastern Railway have completely stalled due to the puppet regime's large-scale arrest of Russian railway staff and key administrative personnel.

The international train departing from the station on the morning of the 24th was delayed for several hours because there was no departure order from the station master. (Dentsu, 26th)</p>
<p>(Harbin) Several more people related to the Chinese Eastern Railway have now been arrested. Rumors circulating about the arrest of Chinese Eastern Railway employees Garina, Raflov, Kubeli, and Abalov on the 24th of this month, claiming that their arrest was the first step in the "Manchu" side's occupation of the Chinese Eastern Railway, have been officially denied by the authorities here. The "Manchu" authorities stated that their detention was related to the matter of withdrawing 79 locomotives into Russia, so they were temporarily detained. Yesterday, the Suifenhe station master, the freight depot director, the Manchouli station master, the owner of the Nikitinsky Hotel, and several others were arrested and will be sent to Harbin. In addition, an accountant, whose name has not been announced, was also detained for illegal expenditures. The Russian Consul-General here, Slavutsky, lodged a protest today. Shiruben replied that the arrest of the Russian personnel of the Chinese Eastern Railway was not because they were Soviet Russian citizens, but because they were criminal employees, hence the arrest. At present, railway operations have been suspended. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Russian Ambassador to Japan has protested to the Japanese government regarding the arrest of several Chinese Eastern Railway employees.

<h3>Russian Newspaper Warns Japan</h3>
<p>Deceptive Tricks to Cover Up the Truth</p>
<p>Japan Should Be Responsible for the Puppet State's Actions</p>
<p>If Japan Does Not Cease Provocative Attitude</p>
<p>Soviet Russia Will Only Be Able to Exercise Its Self-Defense Forces</p>
<p>(Moscow) Today, the organ of the Soviet Russian Communist Party, Pravda, published an article giving Japan a "final warning" in very strong terms, stating that Japan can no longer hide behind the so-called independent puppet state of Manchukuo, as this so-called independent "Manchukuo" cannot bear any responsibility for any incidents that occur within its borders. Therefore, all actions that infringe upon the Russian interests of the Chinese Eastern Railway should be borne by the true ruler of "Manchukuo," which is the Japanese government. The newspaper continued, "It would be greatly beneficial if Japan could consider the warning of the Soviet Russian government. We do not wish to have a conflict with Japan, but if Japan persists in its provocative attitude, then it will certainly receive a just reply. At present, Soviet Russia only has the strength to defend its interests. This fact should be known not only to our friendly nations but also to our enemies." The semi-official newspaper of the Soviet Russian government, Izvestia, also published a similar new commentary, stating that according to recent reports, the puppet Manchu government has active plans in preparation, fearing that it will cause a major conflict.

<h3>Germany Arrests Russian Reporters, Russia Retaliates Against Germany</h3>
<p>German Reporters Ordered to Leave the Country Within Three Days</p>
<p>And All Russian Newspaper Representatives in Germany Recalled</p>
<p>(Berlin) Recently, Mrs. Katz, a reporter for the Soviet government newspaper Izvestia, and Mr. Pesparov, a reporter for TASS, were arrested by the Chief of Police of Leipzig while reporting on the fire incident at the German Parliament Building. They were released after the intervention of the secretary of the Soviet Embassy. The governments of Russia and Germany have now had a disagreement over this matter. The Soviet government has recalled all Russian newspaper representatives stationed in Germany and ordered German journalists within its borders to leave Russian territory within three days, no later than the 29th of this month. This decision was communicated to the German authorities today. According to the Soviet side, the attitude adopted by the German National Socialist government towards the representatives of Soviet Russian newspapers, especially the arrest of Mrs. Katz and Mr. Pesparov, and the prohibition of other Soviet journalists from entering the court to listen to the proceedings, are the reasons for the Soviet government's decision. The Soviet Embassy in Germany lodged an oral protest with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Saturday and Sunday of last week and indicated that the Soviet government intended to take retaliatory measures if necessary, but as of now, the German government believes that a response is unnecessary.

A government spokesman declared that any acts of assault against foreigners will be severely punished and that although there are still several uprisings in the interior, the number of people involved is small and not worth worrying about.

<h3>Executive Yuan's Extra Expenditure Approved by the Directorate of Budget</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan's budget for this year is 840,000 yuan, which is considered insufficient. It has requested to use 3,000 yuan per month from the first reserve fund of the state affairs expenses, amounting to 36,000 yuan for the whole year, and to prepare a separate budget. After review by the Directorate of Budget, it was determined that the Executive Yuan's affairs have recently expanded, and the number of personnel has increased, making 840,000 yuan truly insufficient. The request to use 36,000 yuan for the whole year from the first reserve fund of the state affairs expenses seems reasonable and should be approved immediately. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Guangzhou) According to news from the Pioneer News Agency, District Finance Director Qu Fangpu declared at this morning's memorial week event that the collection of the new foreign rice tax aims to protect farmers from competition and enable farmers to improve their lives. Farmers in Guangdong Province have suffered greatly in recent years due to foreign rice competition. Although rice prices have been lowered, imports cannot be stopped. China spends huge sums of money each year to purchase foreign grain, and if this continues, the nation's wealth will be exhausted. The revenue from the foreign rice tax will be used entirely to improve agricultural affairs and the living conditions of farmers. The Chairman of Guangxi Province has telegraphed the Guangdong authorities, expressing support for the collection of the foreign rice tax and stating that Guangxi Province plans to transport grain to aid Guangdong Province to avoid food shortages for the people, and finally urged rice merchants to awaken quickly and not oppose the tax. The Guangdong Engineering Union has also expressed support for the authorities to implement this tax in order to stop foreign goods competition. The Finance Department will meet with representatives of the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce tomorrow to explain the reasons for collecting this new tax. (26th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Western Shandong Flood Relief Association Sends Telegram to Beijing Questioning Four Matters</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Western Shandong Flood Relief Association sent a telegram to Wang Jingwei, Song Ziwen, Liu Ruiheng, Li Yizhi, and Wang Yingyu, questioning four matters: (1) The Political Council had previously approved a relief fund of 4 million yuan for Shandong, Henan, and Hebei and a work-relief river management fund of 10 million yuan. Why was the allocation method changed, with the emergency relief and work-relief funds reduced to 1.5 million yuan each, while 1 million yuan was allocated for medical and miscellaneous expenses? (2) How can 1.5 million yuan for work-relief manage the Yellow River? (3) The central government stipulates that expenses for relief funds shall not exceed 0.2% of the relief funds. Therefore, the expenses for 4 million yuan of relief funds should not exceed 8,000 yuan. Is it not excessive that the medical expenses amount to 992,000 yuan? (4) American cotton and wheat should account for 30% of the funds used for construction and rural relief. However, no construction is more important than managing the Yellow River. Throughout history, only managing the Yellow River has been mentioned, not managing the Yangtze River. Over 60 million yuan has been spent on managing the Yangtze River in 20 years. Now, 10 million yuan is allocated for managing the Yellow River, but there is no guarantee. Several dozens of counties in the three provinces have been flooded. Rural relief should prioritize the three provinces. (26th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Dalian Corpse Box Case</h3>

Whether the two met at the Kodama's house by chance or by premeditation cannot be determined. The two were competing for Dr. Kodama's wife. The wife initially had an affair with the murderer, then abandoned him and fell in love with the deceased, which led to this love murder case. Mr. and Mrs. Kodama witnessed the event at the time. After the incident, the wife left for Japan. The police have telegraphed Japan to request her arrest.

<p>Earthquake on the Adriatic Coast</p>
<p>Italy and Serbia Simultaneously Suffer Disasters</p>
<p>Mexico City The famous Mexican oil port of Tampico has been directly hit by hurricanes twice within ten days. Three-quarters of the port has been reduced to rubble. According to statistics from the Ministry of Interior, the death toll is close to 300, with more than 2,000 injured. Streets are still flooded, and losses are estimated to be in the millions. Upon receiving the report, the government immediately dispatched army planes to investigate. It is reported that the entire port is half-submerged, and traffic is cut off. A plane rescue team is being organized to transport food and medicine for relief. The hurricane suddenly broke out in the Gulf of Mexico, with the rain changing direction and hitting Tampico directly with winds of 100 miles per hour. There was no preparation beforehand, so a torrential rain poured down, and the tide rose on the shore. Houses that were not firmly built collapsed or were washed away by the flood, resulting in many deaths and injuries. More small boats were lost. As the hurricane blew inland, mountain torrents poured down, many fields and houses were washed away, railroads were interrupted, and oil fields were submerged. The scale of the disaster is unprecedented in the history of the port. The local authorities have announced martial law to prevent looting after the flood recedes. (25th Kuomintang News)</p>

<h3>Puppet Organization Sacrifices Northeast Railway Rights</h3>
<p>- Puppet Ministry of Transportation Signs Secret Agreement with Japan -</p>
<p>South Manchuria Railway Company Seizes Operating Rights on All Lines</p>
<p>Totaling Seventeen Lines, 3,495 Kilometers in Length</p>
<p>It has been over two years since the Northeast fell. Not only have the lands of the four provinces been occupied by the violent Japanese, but also the state-owned railways in the Northeast have been sold by the puppet organization to the Japanese South Manchuria Railway Company. We have obtained various documents related to the puppet organization's sale of state-owned railways in the Northeast, statistics on the railways seized, the secret agreement signed by Japan and the puppet organization, and the recent status of the puppet organization's construction of over 40,000 li of highways in the Northeast, which are compiled below to inform our compatriots who are concerned about the Northeast's railway administration.</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Puppet Organization's Sale of Railway Rights</h3>
<p>On March 1 of this year (i.e., the second year of the puppet Datong), which is also the anniversary of the complete occupation of our Northeast state-owned railways, Ding Jianshou, the puppet Minister of Transportation, issued an order to announce the transfer of the Northeast railways (listed below) to the South Manchuria Railway Company, owned by Japan, for management and operation. The instructions and announcements are as follows: (1) Instruction No. 44: "To comply with the order, it is hereby ordered that the railways (railway names listed below) and their affiliated businesses in Announcement No. 7 of the Ministry of Transportation, have been entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway Company for operation since February 9 of the second year of Datong (i.e., 1933). You must comply with this order." (2) Announcement No. 7: "For the purpose of announcement, this Ministry has entrusted the state-owned railways and various affiliated businesses to the South Manchuria Railway Company for operation since February 9 of the second year of Datong. This is hereby announced." (3) The puppet Ministry of Transportation issued a document to various railway bureaus stating, "In compliance with the puppet order, the government and the South Manchuria Railway Company have signed an agreement for the entrusted operation of state-owned railways and associated businesses (including the Songhua River waterway business). All staff members of the relevant bureaus must be subordinate to the Railway General Bureau and continue to serve in their positions from February 9 of the second year of Datong. All rights and obligations previously held by the staff members for their respective railways shall be inherited and handled by the Railway General Bureau. You are hereby informed and instructed to inform."</p>
<h3>Full Text of the Japan-Puppet Organization Agreement</h3>
<p>Article 1: The government of Manchukuo owes the South Manchuria Railway Company a total of approximately 130 million gold yuan in loans. To guarantee this total amount, the already completed railways of Jichang, Jidun, Jihai, Siping-Taonan, Taonan-Angangxi, Taonan-Suosuo, Qiqihar-Koshi, Hulan-Hailun (including a part of the Songhua River waterway business), Shenyang-Hailong, Fengshan (including the Datong Line and affiliated ports), and all assets and income associated with these railways are entrusted to the South Manchuria Railway Company for operation. Article 2: In the event of existing debt relationships between the government of Manchukuo and third parties other than the South Manchuria Railway Company, the South Manchuria Railway Company shall handle them after consultation between the government and the South Manchuria Railway Company. The necessary payments and the repayment funds for the loans of the "Fengshan Line" to the British-Chinese Company shall be paid from the income earned by the South Manchuria Railway Company after the entrusted operation. Also, the "Fengshan" Railway, related to the British-Chinese Company loan, shall not be used as a guarantee for this loan until the loan is resolved. Article 3: The government of Manchukuo shall separately contract the South Manchuria Railway Company to construct the Dunhua-Tumen River Railway, the Lafa-Harbin Railway, and the Taidong-Harbin Railway. The construction cost of these three routes is approximately 100 million gold yuan in total. Furthermore, regarding the aforementioned construction of the Dunhua-Tumen River Railway, Manchukuo should acquire the Tumen River Railway, and Manchukuo shall borrow approximately 6 million gold yuan from the South Manchuria Railway Company as acquisition funds, and also entrust the South Manchuria Railway Company with the operation of this light railway. Article 4: On the same day as the signing of the agreement, the Manchukuo side must publish the Railway Law. The main purpose of this Railway Law is to establish the principle of state-owned railways. The Railway Appropriation Law adopts the principle that all railways belong to the state. According to this law, the Shenyang-Hailong, Hulan-Hailun, and Qiqihar-Koshi lines are nationalized to unify the situation for the South Manchuria Railway Company to operate them. The above four articles shall be observed by both the Japanese and Manchu governments. The effective period is set at twenty years.</p>
<p>After the puppet Ministry of Transportation sold the railways to the South Manchuria Railway Company and signed an agreement with Japan, fearing public opposition, it specifically announced the reasons for the so-called entrusted operation as follows: First, Manchukuo, in order to ensure its security and develop its transportation business, especially regarding the national railway business, is an urgent task that cannot be delayed. Second, the current small railways in Manchukuo are independent and their operations are different, which is not conducive to substantial benefits and is not a unified transportation method. Moreover, before the national railway network plan is fully implemented, the current railways should be unified to seek reasonable operation and achieve economic, technical, and efficient goals. Third, Manchukuo's entrustment of the national railways to the South Manchuria Railway Company for unified operation is based on technical considerations, as the South Manchuria Railway Company has many years of experience and is most suitable. Fourth, the government of Manchukuo owes the South Manchuria Railway Company a huge debt of 130 million yuan. Based on the convenience of both parties, it is appropriate for the creditor to entrust the operation.</p>
<h3>The Railway Law Announced by the Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>The puppet organization's Railway Law was announced by the puppet Minister of Transportation Ding Jianshou in early July of this year with a ministerial order as follows: (1) Railways are state-owned, but railways for general transportation purposes, mainly for local transportation, and railways that are not for general transportation may not be state-owned. (2) To achieve the purpose of state ownership, all necessary railways may be appropriated. The railways to be appropriated, the date of appropriation, compensation, and other matters shall be determined separately. (3) The provisions of the preceding article shall apply to the appropriation of businesses associated with railways. (4) The gauge of state-owned railways shall be 1 meter, 4 decimeters, 3 centimeters, and 5 millimeters wide. However, railways that are not for general transportation may not comply with this dimension. (5) Regarding Article 1, the provisions that railways that are not state-owned shall be determined separately. (6) This law shall be implemented from the date of promulgation.</p>
<h3>Methods of Utilizing Railways by the Puppet Organization</h3>
<p>The following are the methods by which Ding Jianxiu, the puppet Minister of Transportation, simultaneously took over the Shenhai, Huhai, and Qike railways: (1) The government, in accordance with Articles 2 and 3 of the Railway Law, shall take over the railways belonging to the Shenhai Railway Company, the Huhai Railway Company, and the Qike Railway Engineering Bureau, and all related businesses; (2) The date of taking over the railways and related businesses in the preceding article shall be designated by the government; (3) The determination of the compensation price shall be negotiated with each company, and the organization of the review committee shall be determined separately; (4) On the date of the takeover, the government shall inherit the rights and obligations of the company's existing railways and related businesses, but the rights and obligations of borrowed funds shall not be limited; if the borrowed funds in the preceding paragraph are secured by the railway or its related businesses, the government shall inherit the rights and obligations of the borrowed funds; (5) The compensation for the takeover shall be delivered in the form of 6% national bonds to be repaid within 50 years, based on the price determined in Article 3, with any fraction less than 50 yuan calculated as 50 yuan; (6) From the date of the takeover to the date of delivery of the national bonds, the government shall pay the company an equivalent amount at the rate of 6% per annum on the takeover compensation; (7) The government may issue public bonds to the extent necessary for the execution of the takeover; (8) This law shall come into effect from the date of its promulgation.</p>

<h3>More Than 40,000 Li of Highways Constructed</h3>

A total of 45 routes have been surveyed and constructed by the National Highway Construction Bureau of the puppet organization, of which 18,677 kilometers are assigned to the Liaoning Construction Office for construction, 12,979 kilometers to the Changchun Construction Office, and 12,326 kilometers to the Qiqihar Construction Office.

The Changchun and Qiqihar areas are still actively surveying and constructing, and the highways between Nanji Mu, Xinbin, Beipiao, Chaoyang, Lingyuan, Pingquan, Fengtian, and Shunfu are expected to be completed and open to traffic within this year. Moreover, the above-mentioned highways are all interconnected, which is of great importance to military transportation and product dumping.

<h3>Jiaxing</h3>
<p>Burning Rice Stem Borer Eggs and Dead Seedlings</p>
<p>This year's rice stem borer in Jiaxing has spread quite severely, and many rice seedlings have dead hearts. The Rice Stem Borer Control Office has specially prepared and distributed bonuses to the villagers to encourage them to remove the dead-hearted seedlings and collect the rice stem borer eggs. As of now, more than 16,180,000 egg masses and dead-hearted seedlings have been sent from Xinfeng, Qihuang, Xinzha, Fengshi, Wangdian, Zhongdai, Hantang, Tanghui, Chengzhou and other districts, and more than 5,200 yuan in bonuses have been issued. The collected egg masses and seedlings were burned at the Children's Amusement Park on the 25th. Xu Guodong, the promotion director of the Provincial Entomology Bureau, and Zhu Jieshan, the instructor, came to He to supervise. Representatives from various agencies also attended the event.</p>
<h3>Ningbo</h3>
<p>Arresting Armed Bandits on the Chaoyang Ship</p>
<p>The Ningbo Detective Team received a secret report from an informant stating that an armed bandit named Zhang was hiding in the port, plotting illegal activities. After receiving the report, the team ordered detectives to investigate secretly. Sure enough, at 8:00 AM on the 23rd, on the Chaoyang ship off the Jiangbei Bund, the informant pointed out Zhang, and he was arrested. A six-inch Browning pistol with live ammunition was found next to him. After the team arrested Zhang, they also captured a suspect named Wang, who was serving as a militiaman, at the headquarters of the Fifth District Defense Corps of Yin County in Yangshan Hall on the Jiangbei Bund. In Dingxin Street in the city, they captured Chen Yangshi, the mistress of the bandit Zhang. Zhang confessed in the team that he had repeatedly committed kidnapping cases and also confessed that there were still four hostages hidden somewhere. Captain Yu Kangshu, considering the seriousness of the case, again requested the joint trial of the criminal by Administrative Commissioner Zhao Ci Sheng, Yin County Magistrate Chen Doulin, and Ningbo Public Security Bureau Chief Yu Jimin yesterday (the 24th). He then confessed the exact location where the hostages were hidden. After obtaining the confession, Commissioner Zhao personally led a squadron of the Police Brigade of the Public Security Bureau to the countryside to rescue the hostages and arrest the remaining bandits.</p>

Huang has been delayed in Shanghai due to other negotiations. Recently, key Japanese figures have repeatedly visited Huang to inquire about our diplomatic attitude. At about 9:00 AM yesterday morning, Huang drove to Bixun Road to visit Japanese Minister Arima Akira and talked until 9:40 before leaving.

<h3>The Three Directors of the Disaster Relief Group of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Association Departed Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yang Zigong, Tang Mufen, and Cheng Jingsheng</p>
<p>According to Guowen News Agency, the National Government's Yellow River Flood Relief Committee has decided to form disaster relief, work relief, and health groups to carry out disaster relief. Xi Dejiong, the director of the disaster relief group, has decided to establish one investigation and release office each in Kaifeng, Henan, Daming, Hebei, and Jinan, Shandong, to first investigate the disaster situation and then handle the relief. Yesterday, the three directors of the investigation and release offices departed from Shanghai with their staff. Yang Zigong of Henan, Tang Mufen of Hebei, and Cheng Jingsheng of Shandong were originally work relief personnel from Shandong Province and have a lot of experience in river management. Yesterday, the reporter went to visit Mr. Xi Tongqing, an office worker of the association. According to him, the directors of the investigation and release offices have already departed. As for establishing branch offices in each disaster-stricken county, this will be done after the investigation and release offices are established and the situation is clarified. One branch office may be set up in one county, or two counties may jointly set up one branch office. No decision has been made yet. The budget for the disaster relief group is fixed at 1.5 million yuan, but matters such as purchasing relief supplies, setting up porridge kitchens, and accommodating refugees cannot be used to allocate funds, but rather funds must be raised based on the matter. Although the association has slightly fixed the allocation, it is only an approximate number. The continuous rain in Shanghai has nothing to do with the Yellow River, and recent telegrams have confirmed that the water level of the Yellow River is gradually receding. In short, disaster relief cannot be delayed, but the most important thing is for work relief to first block the breaches so that the people can live in peace and work can replace relief. However, at this time, the disaster relief, work relief, and health groups are all actively proceeding.</p>
<p>Zhou Xiangxian, the director of the work relief group of the association, believes that the breaches are waiting to be repaired and the victims are waiting for relief, and it is urgent to start work to block the breaches so that the people can live in peace and work can replace relief. He left Shanghai the night before last with Secretary Luo Dongli to go to Nanjing and, together with Song Xishang, the director of the engineering group, went to Shandong and Henan yesterday to conduct on-the-spot investigations and measurements. The internal organization of the work relief group consists only of administrative and engineering groups. Zhou himself serves as the director of the administrative group, and Song Xishang, the chief engineer of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, concurrently serves as the director of the engineering group. Since Zhou Xiangxian is the chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission, most of the personnel of the Yellow River Flood Relief Association's work relief group are transferred from the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission on a concurrent basis, so as to save expenses and rescue more victims.</p>
<h3>Commander Imamura of the Japanese Third Fleet Visited the Municipal Authorities Yesterday Morning</h3>

The mayor and Commissioner Wang Changchun went down the steps to greet them and invited them into the mayor's reception room. They exchanged words of admiration and exchanged pleasantries. Then they each drank a glass of champagne. They left at 11:00 and went to the Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement for a formal visit. They were received by Chairman Bell and others, and 30 members of the Russian team of the Shanghai Volunteer Corps were sent to stand in formation and salute to show solemnity. At 3:00 in the afternoon, Chairman Bell and Director-General Zhong Sijun returned to visit the commander on the flagship Izumo.</p>
<h3>Miss William's Letter to Wu Dingchang Praising China's Anti-War Movement</h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Anti-Civil War League, not only the Chinese people have unanimously supported it, but also people from friendly countries have sincerely assisted it. Recently, Miss William from the United States sent a letter to Chairman Wu of the Anti-War League, saying, "Mr. Wu Dingchang, I have received your letter of July 5 with respect. At that time, Mr. Davis happened to be in this country, so I immediately sent a copy of your esteemed letter to Mr. Davis. I am delighted to know that your country's Anti-Civil War League believes that our country's Goodwill Committee can be expected to help it proceed in the future. We sincerely hope that you all also know that we deeply admire the organization and nature of your association. Our country's Goodwill Committee is extremely honored to be able to fully cooperate with China's patriotic groups. I am also pleased to read that your association's work is progressing day by day. Your association's slogan is 'China must not have another civil war,' which is not only a blessing for China but also a blessing for the whole world. Today's scholars all know that the key to the peace and prosperity of the world today lies entirely in China. To seek China's unification, peace, and stability, there must be a national construction plan, and the success of this plan depends heavily on the assistance of industrialized countries. Therefore, countries that cooperate with China will share the benefits of its revitalization with China. Therefore, the American Goodwill Committee deeply hopes that after coming to China, it can further express the American people's desire for your association's success and enhance the relationship between China and the United States. Moreover, China and the United States must have a closer economic relationship for their own benefit. China's great mass consumption capacity and the United States' great mass production capacity are naturally matched. Based on the experience of the past four years, our country knows that mass production without corresponding mass consumption is more dangerous than mass consumption without corresponding mass production. This shows that our desire for Sino-American cooperation is truly for the common political and economic interests of both countries. Therefore, your association's ability to bring peace and unification to China is equally beneficial to both China and the United States and can serve as a preliminary step for international cooperation. I am pleased to hear that President Liu Zhan'en of Shanghai University will soon come to the United States and represent your association to discuss progress with the American Goodwill Committee. We deeply know that Mr. Liu will definitely cooperate successfully with our association. We look forward to his arrival with great joy. I know that you will send me your esteemed book 'Commentary on the Three Principles of the People.' When I have the opportunity to read it, I will definitely gain a lot. I hereby respectfully wish you success in your patriotic efforts and look forward to cooperating with you with great pleasure. Sincerely, William, August 14, 1933, from New York."</p>
<h3>Du Yuesheng and Others Initiate the Pudong Wind Disaster Relief Association Established Yesterday</h3>
<p>－Scheduled to Petition Finance Minister Song and the Jiangsu Provincial Government－</p>
<p>The recent hurricane that swept through Shanghai caused particularly severe damage in Pudong, Chuansha, Nanhui, and other areas. The disaster-stricken people are in urgent need of help. Gentry and merchants from these areas asked Mr. Du Yuesheng and other prominent figures in Shanghai to find ways to provide relief. Mr. Du and others specially formed the "Shanghai Pudong Wind and Tide Disaster Relief Committee," which was officially established yesterday. They are scheduled to petition Finance Minister Song for funds and the Jiangsu Provincial Government. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(Representatives Present) Those present yesterday included Xu Shiying (represented by Huang Bodu), Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng, Wang Yiting (represented by Huang Hanzhi), Lu Wenshao, Li Zicai, Yu Zuoting (represented by Gao Jijing), Zou Bingwen, Wen Lanting, Wang Yansong, Yang Qingyuan, Pang Hanzhi, Chen Songyuan, Hu Bijang (represented by Xu Jianwu), Chen Zixin, Gu Wensheng, Xu Xinliu, Shi Liangcai, Zhang Bochou, Feng Bingnan, Lu Bohong, Huang Renzhi, Yuan Ludeng, Yuan Xiluo, Gui Yanfang, Guan Jiongzhi, Lin Kanghou, Zheng Hongnian, Wu Yunzhai, and over a hundred others, chaired by Du Yuesheng.</p>
<p>(Chairman's Report) After the meeting opened with formalities, Chairman Du Yuesheng first reported on the disaster situation, saying, "On the evenings of the 2nd and 18th of this month, two major wind and tide disasters occurred. In Pudong and other areas, countless people, livestock, fields, and houses were submerged and washed away. Hengsha, Gaodunsha, Yuanyuan, and other three sandbars in Chuansha are isolated in the sea, and the situation is particularly severe. It is now found that apart from the disaster victims who have relatives and friends to turn to and those who have died, there are countless people without food, clothing, or shelter. There are more than 25,000 people in Chuansha, Nanhui, and other areas. The area is barren and the people are poor, and there is no way to provide relief. Therefore, the county magistrates and gentry and merchants of the two counties came to Shanghai for help. We have established this association to ask all sectors to generously donate to accomplish this charitable cause." Next, Wang Xiaolai, Shi Liangcai, and Li Leng, the magistrate of Chuansha County, gave reports in succession (details omitted).</p>
<p>(Dike Collapse) Subsequently, Yuan Xiluo, the magistrate of Nanhui County, reported on the disaster situation, saying, "In the first district of Nanhui County, 3,300 zhang of dikes collapsed. 1,094 zhang of dikes were breached, 592 zhang collapsed, and the remaining 1,600 zhang were also damaged. The second district had 4,300 zhang of dikes, with 1,310 zhang breached and 2,990 zhang collapsed. The rest were also badly damaged. The fourth district had 3,200 zhang of dikes, with 156 zhang breached and 167 zhang collapsed. The rest were also damaged. In total, 2,560 zhang of dikes were breached and 3,749 zhang collapsed."</p>
<p>(Overview of Disaster) The Pudong Fellow Villagers Association's investigation report stated, "The disaster area in the first district of Nanhui is 80,000 mu, affecting 12 townships with a total of 968 households and 4,519 disaster victims. 356 houses collapsed, 12 people died, and 86 people were injured. 37,590 jin of accumulated grain have been distributed.

<p>(Telegrams Sent) To the National Government of Nanjing, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Interior, the Zhenjiang Provincial Government, the Department of Civil Affairs, and the Department of Finance, greetings. Pudong is unfortunate. Two major wind and tide disasters occurred in winter and late evening, causing dikes and embankments in Chuansha, Nanhui, and coastal areas to collapse. Countless people, livestock, fields, and houses were submerged, especially the three sands of Hengsha, Gaodun, and Yuanyuan in Chuansha, which were completely submerged. Apart from those who have died, there are currently more than 25,000 people in the two counties who have no clothing, food, or shelter and cannot live from day to day. Now, our association is trying its best to provide urgent relief, but our efforts are too weak to be of much help. These disaster victims are all good people. Please quickly allocate funds to save their lives and restore their vitality. Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Shanghai Pudong Wind and Tide Disaster Relief Association,</p>
<p>Du Yuesheng, and others respectfully kowtow.</p>
<p>(Fundraising Appeal) Crossing the Huangpu River to the east, going beyond the Shanghai city area, Chuansha is to the north, and Nanhui is to the south. Villages and hamlets face each other, and the sounds of chickens and dogs can be heard. Wheat is suitable for spring, and cotton and rice are suitable for autumn. Every year, there is a considerable output to supply the food needs of the entire society. In Chuansha County, there are three relatively large sandbars: Hengsha, Gaodunsha, and Yuanyuan. Over the past forty years, dikes have been built to create fields, the population has grown daily, and productivity has advanced daily. On the night of September 2nd this year, a hurricane struck violently, and the tide rose sharply. The residents of the three sandbars were awakened from their sleep by the roaring flood. They climbed onto their roofs, but the roofs collapsed. They climbed the trees, but the trees broke. Men, women, old, and young cried out in the wilderness. In an instant, some families did not know where to go, some elders over ninety years old were on the verge of death but did not die, some three- or four-year-old children cried and searched for their mothers. One farm woman climbed onto the roof but could not hold on, so she grabbed a piece of wood and held it tightly, drifting with the raging current for a day and a night until she reached the coast of Ningbo, where she was rescued and sent back home. In addition, countless families were destroyed and died. Among the reeds and debris, dead people and livestock were piled up, and the stench was overwhelming, making it impossible to pass by without covering one's nose. It is estimated that over eight thousand people were affected by the disaster. On the mainland coast, the dikes in the first, second, and fourth districts of Nanhui collapsed, submerging over 30,000 mu of fertile land. Over two hundred houses were blown down or washed away, and over two thousand shi of grain were flooded. Over a thousand people climbed onto roofs to escape the water. The situation in the fourth and fifth districts of Chuansha to the north was largely similar. At that time, Magistrate Yuan of Nanhui and Magistrate Li of Chuansha, together with enthusiastic locals, personally visited the disaster areas and urgently collected relief funds and supplies, which were distributed quickly. Just as they were gathering, the second hurricane arrived on September 18th. There was a storm all day, and at night, it brought a large sea tide. The dikes of the three sandbars that had not been destroyed were completely breached, and the coastal mainland, east of the third regiment and Laogang in Nanhui, became a vast expanse of water, completely transformed into a swamp. Sixty li of dikes from north to south were all washed into sawtooth shapes. In Chuansha, the Penggong and Huanggong dikes in the eighth and ninth regiments, which had just been hastily repaired, were breached again, and the flood directly approached the Qin Gong dike, eight or nine li from the sea. A family surnamed Cao, with five members, were all swept into the sea. A person surnamed X, an elderly man of seventy-eight years old, was submerged by the flood. Members of the Pudong Fellow Villagers Association who went to inspect and special commissioners from the Chinese Jishi Society who went to distribute relief all said that such a tragic situation was unprecedented in previous years. A person who is injured once and then injured again is called "severely injured." Ancient benevolent people were saddened and prohibited it. A place that experiences one disaster and then another is called "repeated disasters." Ancient historical records recorded and lamented it. Now, those who are lying dead or barely surviving in the bitter wind and rain among the reeds and broken ports are not those whom we call "compatriots"? Are they not the purest and most law-abiding good people of the Republic of China, who repay the country with their blood and sweat? The clothes we wear and the food we eat, if we trace their origins, all come from the hard work of these people throughout the year. Now, those who usually clothe and feed us to live are dead. Those who survived one disaster die in the second. Even if they have not died, they are not far from death. And we who wear their clothes and eat their food, are we to turn a blind eye to their misery as if we do not see it? Are we to turn a deaf ear to the sounds of sorrow that fill our ears as if we do not hear them? Our government and caring people in our society are vigorously advocating "revitalizing the countryside" and "relieving farmers." If we abandon these farmers in the most productive countryside, who have suffered the most severe disasters once and twice, and who are in the most urgent need of relief, and do not plan for relief, it is a loss of conscience in terms of virtue and a misjudgment in terms of politics. Officials of the two counties and local public organizations have gathered all their strength to investigate and provide relief. Nanhui has a larger area and more victims, while Chuansha has a smaller area but has suffered even more severely. The population seeking food is estimated at 10,000 in Chuansha and 15,000 in Nanhui. If each person eats two yuan per month, and only counting four months, 200,000 yuan is needed. There are 3,000 households in Chuansha and 4,000 households in Nanhui without homes. If each household is assisted with 10 yuan for building a house, 70,000 yuan is needed. Each set of winter clothing costs one yuan, requiring 25,000 yuan. This is the current emergency need, totaling no less than 300,000 yuan. The cost of repairing dikes and embankments and the funds for plowing and stabilizing the land next spring are not included in this. The members of this association, remembering that Shanghai is the hub of land and sea transportation, and that the people of Shanghai have always done their best when there are disasters in various places, and have participated in every effort. Now, within a few tens of li of our Shanghai, within one or two weeks, we have encountered major disasters, once and twice, with the loss of hundreds of lives and tens of thousands of people without clothing, food, or homes. "If people want to do good, who is not like me?" We dare not ask for repayment, but we cannot but call on you. We only hope that benevolent people, righteous people, public and private legal entities of the present time will generously assist us with a constant stream. What can be predicted is that the relief funds will not be wasted, and the relief efforts will all be practical. All income and expenditure will be publicly reported. We only seek to save one more disaster victim, to preserve one more good farmer's life, and thus to maintain one more source of production. The vast flood, the floating white bones, living as hardworking farmers in summer fields, dying as floating corpses in autumn tides, we dare to wipe away our tears and beg for your generous donations.</p>

<h3>The Municipal Government's Opinion on the Factory Inspection Case</h3>
<p>The Bureau of Public Works Has No Right to Formulate Labor Regulations</p>
<p>Still Hoping to Maintain the Spirit of Cooperation as Always</p>
<p>Do Not Persist in Unreasonable Claims</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports that regarding the negotiation on the factory inspection case in the Concession, because the Municipal Government representative refused the Bureau of Public Works' proposal that the inspection team formed by both parties should be supervised by the Bureau, similar to the method of collecting stamp tax and special cigarette tax, the situation has reached a stalemate. As reported in the previous news, the reporter, after seeing the propaganda published by the North-China Daily News yesterday, in order to understand our side's attitude, specially visited a municipal official, who made the following remarks:</p>
<p>The Chinese government, in view of the fact that factories in Shanghai have repeatedly caused disasters due to poor equipment or management, resulting in numerous deaths and injuries, and in order to protect the safety of workers, improve the conditions of workers, and promote harmonious labor-capital relations, believes that factory inspection is a matter of urgency. Since factories in the Concession account for two-thirds of the city's factories, if it is not implemented simultaneously, the handling will inevitably encounter many obstacles, so officials were sent to consult with the Concession authorities. For half a year, the representatives of both parties repeatedly studied and drafted a compromise plan. It was heard that after the plan was submitted to the board meeting of the Bureau, the other party suddenly proposed that the inspection team should be supervised by them, which greatly affected the progress of the case, which is deeply regrettable. The Bureau of Public Works, knowing that it is not allowed to formulate labor regulations in the Concession to be followed by taxpayers, initially wanted to obtain a legal basis for managing factories by revising Article 34 of the Yangjingbang Regulations Annex. Then, it considered citing the provisions of Article 35 of the Annex, which deal with the prohibition of dangerous businesses, to expand its powers and achieve the purpose of managing factories. Regarding the former, the Bureau of Public Works cannot seize our country's administrative power by revising the annex, because the territorial rights in the Concession still belong to our country, and the Chinese people in the Concession do not sever their natural and legal relationship with our government simply because they reside in the Concession. Regarding the latter, the so-called dangerous businesses should have a clear interpretation and a reasonable scope. If they are forcibly attached and arbitrarily prohibited, Chinese merchants in the Concession will be unable to operate happily. Foreigners often think that the Chinese authorities are being troublesome by insisting on sovereignty, but anyone who understands the history of the Shanghai Concession knows that the Bureau of Public Works cannot be compared to ordinary municipal agencies. Its legal status and powers are clearly limited, and its encroachments on its authority should not be ignored. Factory inspection cannot be delayed any longer. The Chinese government sincerely hopes that the Concession authorities will consider the seriousness of this issue, maintain the spirit of cooperation as always, and not persist in claims that are unreasonable in law and reason, so that this case can be resolved as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Mrs. Tang Haian Donates Money to Relieve Refugees</h3>
<p>Mrs. Tang Haian, wife of Tang Haian, Superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, deeply saddened by the severity of the Yellow River flood, with wailing cries of disaster victims everywhere, and people starving and waiting to be fed, specially donated 500 yuan yesterday for the purpose of relieving the refugees. The original letter from Mrs. Tang to the Urgent Relief Association is recorded below: "Dear Sir, I am enclosing a check for 500 yuan as Mrs. Tang Haian's donation for the Yellow River flood refugees. Please check and acknowledge receipt. Sincerely, Tang Haian. To the United Association for Raising Funds for Urgent Relief of the Yellow River Flood."</p>

<h3>Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association Holds Annual General Meeting Today</h3>
<p>Re-election of Executives and Supervisors, and Welcome New Members</p>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' National Products Promotion Association was established in 1920. Over the past 13 years, it has worked diligently, and its affairs have prospered, attracting the belief of the national populace and being recognized as a group promoting national product production and sales cooperation. This spring, Executive Committee member Sun Daosheng designed and held the second membership recruitment drive, with Mayor Wu serving as the general captain, Education Director Pan as the chief of staff, and Wang Xiaolai and others as squad leaders, leading the promotion and enthusiastically recruiting. National product factories and mayors from all walks of life heard the news and participated, and the number of members increased sharply, with factory members reaching over 320 and individual members reaching 1,500.

<h3>Sharp Decline in Cotton Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>Statement by the Yarn Factory Federation Regarding the 20 Million Loan</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, it was reported that cotton yarn manufacturers requested a loan of 20 million from the Ministry of Finance to help the yarn factories. The reporter went to the Yarn Factory Federation to inquire about the matter. According to them, the current situation of the yarn factories is extremely difficult. In the previous reduction of working hours, there was already a request for government assistance. Now, the National Economic Commission, in view of the sharp decline in cotton yarn prices and the huge losses of yarn factories, plans to set up a Cotton Industry Control Committee to study fundamental and symptomatic solutions, and to allocate a large sum of money from the US cotton sales to regulate finance and promote cotton yarn sales.</p>
<h3>Xu Peihuang, Director of the Bureau of Public Utilities, Officially Takes Office</h3>
<p>After Huang Boqiao, Director of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities, was transferred to the position of Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways, the vacancy was temporarily filled by Xu Peihuang, a specialist appointed by the Municipal Government. Subsequently, the Ministry of Railways, recognizing Director Huang's outstanding performance in office, consulted with the Municipal Government and agreed to relieve Huang of his duties at the Bureau of Public Utilities so that Huang could focus on serving the two railways. At the same time, the Municipal Government submitted a request to the National Government to appoint Xu to succeed him, and he officially took office at the Bureau a few days ago.</p>
<h3>Jiangwan Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument</h3>
<p>In front of the Jiangwan Labor University, on the open space next to the Songhu Railway Station, the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Monument, which was previously funded and built by various circles in Jiangwan and inscribed with calligraphy by Tan Yankai, Cai Yuanpei, Yi Peiji, and others, stands tall and is quite magnificent. Unfortunately, it was damaged by artillery fire during the January 28th Incident, which is detrimental to the local landscape. The Seventh District Party Headquarters in the area, in view of this, launched a reconstruction project. The estimated repair cost has been determined, and it is planned to raise funds from various institutions, organizations, gentry, and wealthy people in the town in order to build the monument. According to the resolution of the 50th Executive Committee meeting of the Party Headquarters, Li Xiamin, Zhong Yibo, Wu Yigeng, Dai Hongen, Chen Baotai, Diao Qingen, Gu Shanzhang, and others were appointed as fundraising committee members, and a meeting will be held at the headquarters at 3:00 PM on the 30th of this month to discuss the implementation plan.</p>
<h3>The Account Records of the Righteous Army Support Association Are Sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Again for Safekeeping and Verification</h3>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is responsible for the general affairs and safekeeping of the verification committee</p>
<p>The Northeast Righteous Army Support Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating: "Dear Sirs, on September 23rd, we received your letter stating that this case was initially instructed by the Municipal Government to be investigated and handled by the Social Affairs Bureau. Today, we also saw the Municipal Party Headquarters' 92nd notice, stating that all national salvation organizations should send the account records of donations they have handled to the Shanghai All Circles Verification of National Salvation Committee for review within one week. This plan has been approved, and the deadline is limited. Therefore, after discussion at the 50th Standing Committee meeting of our association, it was decided that the sent receipts should be returned to the various national salvation organizations, asking them to handle it themselves, without the need for our association to forward them. Our association then submitted it to the 181st Standing Committee meeting for discussion, which unanimously agreed that the account records of donations handled should have been submitted to the Verification of National Salvation Donations Committee for review long ago. The reason for sending the account books and receipts to your association for safekeeping, pending verification, was not to entrust you to forward them, as the committee is a temporary gathering and may be disbanded at any time. If there are no widely trusted members responsible for safekeeping, and the account records are slightly lost, who will be asked in the future? Your association has a long history and the highest public trust. The committee is attached to your association, and your association is the leading member of the committee and holds the position of general affairs. You should be responsible for safekeeping all important files. Therefore, submitting them to your association is no different from submitting them directly to the committee. The decision was made to send the account books and receipts to your association for inventory and safekeeping, and to provide them for review when the verification committee meets. In accordance with the case, the corresponding list of receipts and payments books and receipts is sent together with a letter. Please check and acknowledge receipt. Enclosed is a list of the items, including 20 volumes of the donor registration book, 2 volumes of the collection book, 1 volume of the payment book, 1 volume of the collection and payment general book, 1 volume of the bank deposit and withdrawal book, 144 copies of the recipient's receipts, and 2 copies of the general report of donation receipts and expenditures."</p>
<h3>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association Recently Received a Report from a Disaster Investigation Specialist</h3>
<p>The Sino-Foreign Relief Association received reports and telegrams about the flood disasters in the North and South, indicating the extreme seriousness of the situation. For Chongming and other areas, it specially dispatched specialist Chai Yeyu to investigate. Zheng Shouchun had already been dispatched to Luyu and other provinces to conduct an on-the-ground survey. The reports received from Chai and Zheng on the same day yesterday are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Chongming Chai Yeyu's report: "I arrived in Chongming yesterday and first rushed to the most severely affected Fifth District. This district is located in the west of Chongming, bordering the sea and the river. In past years, it has always been the first to bear the brunt of disasters. This time, it was just hit by the Jiangye catastrophe, and by chance, it was hit by a second hurricane the next night, the scope of which was even larger than before. All the dikes were destroyed for 30 miles, and countless fields were submerged. More than 2,000 households inside the head dike were completely washed away. In addition to the disaster victims who can be taken in by relatives or scattered in all directions, there are still more than 10,000 people in urgent need of relief. Yeyu then went with the food relief boat of the district office. Everywhere he passed, it was a vast expanse of water. It was very difficult for the disaster victims to go to the town to seek food because they were surrounded by deep water and had no strength to swim, and many starved to death. When they heard that the food relief boat had arrived, they cried out in sorrow, which could be heard for several miles. The situation was extremely tragic. Many old and weak people, because they were in pain because they had no clothes, no food, and no home to return to, were willing to sit and wait for death and did not want to survive. Because they had not eaten for many days, they lay in the holes in the embankment, with faint voices and no strength to move. According to the villagers, this time the fields were filled with salt water, and it will be difficult to plant in the spring next year. The dikes must be repaired urgently, or there may be hope. If this continues, the fields will forever turn into lakes and ponds. According to reports, after the two hurricanes in Chongming, except for the Sixth District, which was relatively less affected, all the other districts were severely affected, especially the Fifth and Third Districts."</p>
<p>Chengwu Zheng Shouchun's report: "I have arrived in Chengwu County, Shandong, and traveled throughout the area. The water in the east and west districts has not receded to this day. The old Yellow River area is still one or two feet deep. Only half of the land can be used to grow grain. Most of the salt-producing areas have been submerged. A total of 360 villages have been flooded, and more than 4,100 hectares of farmland have been submerged. There are more than 60,000 disaster victims, and the losses are estimated at more than 1.8 million yuan." The association believes that the waters from the breaches of the Yellow River have not yet receded, and Chongming and other counties have been hit by two hurricanes. The weather has turned cold in autumn, and the disaster victims in various places are starving and freezing, waiting for relief. However, it is difficult to raise relief funds, and it is difficult to provide universal relief. The association is deeply worried and hopes that all sectors will quickly lend a helping hand to save the survivors of this water disaster.</p>
<h3>Baoshan Seawall Needs Funds for Emergency Repair</h3>
<p>Yan Fenglou and others telegraphed the Jiangsu Provincial Government: "To Chairman Gu and Director Dong of the Construction Department of the Jiangsu Provincial Government, After the danger occurred in the Baoyi Seawall on the 2nd of this month, Zhang, a technician dispatched by you, inspected and estimated the damage section by section, and approved an emergency repair fee of 60,000 yuan. However, just after construction started, it was hit by a hurricane again on the 18th, and thousands of feet of damage occurred again, with seven or eight breaches. The newly built emergency repair project was completely washed away. The dispatched engineer re-estimated the damage and reported all the dangers. Considering the local situation, you had already approved the construction of the North Shidong South Yanchi breach in the Fifth District and the North Yanchi 125 zhang. However, before the main project could be completed, it was hit by two typhoons. The embankment surface at the three-zhang-odd breach in that section was almost completely destroyed. The dangerous situation is indescribable. If the wind had not changed direction at the time, it would have become a continuation of the counties in western Shandong. The thought of it is terrifying. The engineer who came to inspect this time probably did not inspect the dangerous situation in that section because the embankment line was long. Fenglou and others are deeply frightened. We implore you to consider that the more than 1.2 million mu of tax revenue along the embankment is at stake, and the economic center of Shanghai relies on this line of embankment. Please quickly transfer 25,000 yuan from the 60,000 yuan estimated by Zhang, a technician, and the expenses to be increased estimated by the engineer, together with the emergency repair fee for the 125 zhang that has not been estimated, in one week, so that the emergency repair project can be completed before the 18th day of the lunar calendar in August to protect the lives and property of the people. Fenglou and others are in public office in the area, and the people are constantly blaming us. The public is panicked and cannot live in peace. We dare to make the sixth plea. Time is pressing, please quickly allocate funds for emergency repairs, without any responsibility for waiting. Yan Fenglou and Zhang Wenxiong, the township chiefs and embankment directors of Shizi Township, Huiyuan Township, Fifth District, Baoshan County, and all the villagers kowtow."</p>
<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway Announces the Content of Central Loan "Surplus Profit Certificates"</h3>
<p>A total of 580,000 pounds were issued, limited to 50 years for repayment.</p>
<p>The total amount of surplus profits paid is more than 2.8 million yuan.</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai Railway was built with a loan from the Chinese and British Bank. Among them, there is a type of "surplus profit certificate," with a total amount of 500,000 gold pounds. The total amount of surplus profits over the years has reached more than 3.37 million yuan. The content of the certificate is mostly unknown to the outside world. Now the Railway Bureau specially announces its content and process as follows:</p>
<p>(Issuance Process) According to Article 12 of the railway loan contract, one-fifth of the surplus profits of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway should belong to the Chinese and British Bank. Therefore, "surplus profit certificates" were issued at one-fifth of the total cost value of the railway, with a face value of 200 English pounds per certificate, and issued in installments at the same time as the loan notes. The amount of each time depends on the amount of loan notes issued, up to one-fifth of the total amount. The annual income of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, in addition to the payment of various expenses, road maintenance, station repairs, addition and replacement of locomotives, and office expenses, as well as the annual interest rate of 5% for the loan notes and the annual interest rate of 6% for the land price purchased by the China Railway Corporation itself or borrowed from other silver companies, is all surplus profit. One-fifth of the surplus profit is submitted to the silver company for distribution to the holders of the surplus profit certificates.</p>
<p>(Total Amount and Time Limit) The "surplus profit certificates" are issued at one-fifth of the actual loan amount of 2.9 million pounds for the railway, for a total of 580,000 pounds, with a term of 50 years. However, within the 50-year period, China can redeem them at any time at the original face value. The certificates will be invalidated after the expiration date, without the need for redemption. However, before redemption or before the expiration date, the surplus profits that the railway should distribute according to the regulations must still be distributed before they can be cancelled.</p>
<p>(Surplus Profits Paid) The Sino-British loan contract states that "surplus profit certificates" do not pay interest. The actual amount of the surplus profit issued and not issued over the years since 1921 (previous years had no surplus) is shown in the following table:</p>
<p>1921: 361,346.10 yuan, paid in full in September 1922</p>
<p>1922: 345,669.63 yuan, paid in full in September 1923</p>
<p>1923: 45,661.63 yuan, paid in full in September 1924</p>
<p>1924: 343,861.29 yuan, paid in full in September 1927</p>
<p>1925: 201,373.79 yuan, paid in full in September 1928</p>
<p>1926: 176,336.81 yuan</p>
<p>1927: 105,437.00 yuan, paid in full in September 1929</p>
<p>1928: 392,940.46 yuan</p>
<p>1929: 498,839.20 yuan, paid in installments in August 1930</p>
<p>1930: 241,020.97 yuan, unpaid</p>
<p>1931: 293,249.59 yuan, unpaid</p>
<p>Total: 3,375,736.47 yuan</p>
<p>According to the above table, as of the end of 1931, the total amount of surplus profits was 3,375,736.47 yuan, of which 2,841,465.91 yuan had been paid, and 534,270.56 yuan had not been paid.</p>

<h3>Resolution of Disputes Between the Two Exchanges Regarding the Merger of Financial Markets</h3>
<p>Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin mediate</p>
<p>Plan to raise 2 million to organize a new market</p>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, regarding the merger of the two gold markets in Shanghai, the Ministry of Industry, considering the difficulties of the merchants, granted an extension of three months after the expiration date of May 31 of this year, as the two parties had not yet reached an agreement. The extension was until August 31, and no further extensions were allowed, to show the government's attitude. However, the authorities of the two exchanges still failed to merge due to their respective rights and interests. The Ministry of Industry then indicated that they would forcibly close the exchanges. Fortunately, Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin, prominent figures in the business community, took the initiative to mediate, and a formal resolution was reached on the 24th of this month. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency inquired with the authorities of the two exchanges yesterday, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Telegram Requesting Extension) According to the law, the Ministry of Industry originally required the merger of the two exchanges to be resolved before May 31 of this year. However, at that time, the Goods Exchange only merged the securities part with the Huashang Securities Exchange, while the gold part still failed to negotiate a resolution with the Gold Exchange. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry granted a further extension of three months to allow for a more leisurely discussion and indicated that no further extensions would be allowed after the expiration date. However, as of August 31, the attitudes of the two exchanges were still difficult to reconcile. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry indicated that it would forcibly close the exchanges and reorganize them separately. Du Yuesheng and Zhang Xiaolin heard about this and took the initiative to mediate. They also telegraphed the Ministry of Industry to allow continued operations during the mediation period. The Ministry of Industry agreed, and the mediation work began.</p>
<p>(Successful Mediation) The reason why the negotiations between the two exchanges had not been resolved was the issue of the rights of both parties, such as the control of brokers and the selection of the market. Initially, Yu Qiaqing, the chairman of the Goods Exchange, and Xu Pusheng, the chairman of the Gold Exchange, had several discussions, but they could not reach an agreement. At one point, it was proposed to set up two separate gold markets, Gold Market No. 1 and No. 2, so that the names would be unified and the operations could be the same, but this also failed to reach an agreement. After Du and Zhang took the initiative to mediate, they summoned Yu and Xu to have an open and honest discussion, proceeding on the principle of equality and mutual benefit, and put forward a plan. Both parties were satisfied and signed a contract on the spot on the 24th of this month at the Hangzhou Restaurant, formally resolving the dispute.</p>
<p>(Separate Organization) After this mediation was established, both parties decided to abolish the original names of the two exchanges and jointly form a new exchange as the only financial market in Shanghai. The capital was set at 2 million yuan. The name, address, and how to organize the exchange will be determined by first organizing a preparatory committee, with Yu Qiaqing and Xu Pusheng as members of the preparatory committee. Du and Zhang will also join to ensure that the progress of both parties does not give rise to any further disagreements.</p>
<p>(Establishment in Two Months) According to the authorities of the two exchanges, the name and location of the exchange have not yet been determined. Whether the address will be selected from one of the two exchanges or purchased separately will depend on whether the transportation is convenient. During the preparation period for the new market, the two exchanges will continue to operate as usual. The authorities of the two exchanges and the mediators Du and Zhang have telegraphed the Ministry of Industry separately for verification. As for when the new market will be established, Sheng Buhua of the Goods Exchange told reporters that it would probably be within one or two months and would not be protracted.</p>
<p>(Citywide Unity) The reason why the Ministry of Industry ordered the merger was that the Exchange Law stipulates that there should not be two markets of the same nature in the same area, to avoid confusion in the market situation. Now that the merger of the two exchanges has been resolved, there will be no further disputes in Shanghai after the new market is organized. The gold market can also be unified. Also, when the dispute between the two exchanges was unresolved, merchants in Shanghai, such as Zhang Danru, submitted a request to the Social Affairs Bureau, which was forwarded to the Municipal Government, proposing to set up a Gold and Silver Exchange so that the financial market would not be interrupted if the negotiations between the two exchanges broke down and the Ministry of Industry forcibly closed the exchanges. Now that the merger issue has been resolved, there is no need to set up a separate Gold and Silver Exchange that is in preparation.</p>
<h3>Wharf Strike Disrupts Silk and Tea Export Delays</h3>
<p>Numerous European and American Goods Obstructed in Huangpu River</p>
<p>Merchants Negotiating with Wheelock Marden for Losses</p>
<p>Wheelock Marden's barge transportation services play a crucial role in Shanghai's foreign export trade. The company owns over 150 barges of various sizes and employs more than 400 barge workers. The recent strike caused by worker layoffs has lasted for nearly twenty days. Although a settlement was initially reached a few days ago, with workers agreeing to return to work, negotiations subsequently broke down again, and the strikers have not resumed work. This has had a significant impact on Shanghai's exports. Merchants, concerned about the obstruction of goods, have been questioning Wheelock Marden and demanding compensation for their losses. The recent situation is detailed below:</p>
<p>(Large Quantities of Chinese Tea Blocked) When ships depart from Shanghai, merchants entrust the valuable goods to Wheelock Marden's barges for transportation, as they are considered more reliable. On the 19th of this month, the British mail steamer "Ellora" was scheduled to sail to England, carrying 700 chests of high-quality Chinese tea from Shanghai to London. The merchants entrusted the tea to Wheelock Marden's barges for transfer. However, a strike suddenly broke out while the tea was loaded onto the barges, resulting in all the tea being blocked on the barges and unable to be transferred to the mail steamer. Despite repeated negotiations between the merchants and Wheelock Marden, no solution has been found. The goods remain on the barges in the Huangpu River as of yesterday.</p>
<p>(Shipment of Goods to America Also Delayed) Furthermore, over 200 tons of goods destined for New York, USA, have also been blocked by the strike after being loaded onto Wheelock Marden's barges. The shipping company's attempt to send workers to unload the goods was rejected by the strikers. In addition, a large quantity of pig bristles and silk waste, destined for Marseille, France, has also been held up and cannot be loaded onto the ship. The merchants have had to postpone the shipment, rescheduling the loading of these blocked goods for October 3rd. However, it remains uncertain whether the situation will be resolved by then.</p>
<p>(Merchants Negotiating for Losses) The merchants argue that the delays caused by the Wheelock Marden barge strike for items such as silk and tea affect the market prices when the goods arrive in Europe and America. Furthermore, the export of goods is based on estimated arrival dates, which are related to bank financing and marine insurance. The recipients of the goods also suffer significantly due to market demand. Therefore, valuable goods must be loaded onto regular mail steamers, which have fixed arrival times. The current delay of over fourteen days caused by the barge strike has had a ripple effect on all aspects of the trade. The merchants have suffered substantial losses and are now sending letters to Wheelock Marden, demanding that the company bear the full cost of the delayed exports.</p>

<p>Wang Heqing, a small carpentry foreman from Ningbo, 33 years old, residing in a shack at 8 Feihong Road, Zhabei, recently developed an irreconcilable feud with Mao Laosan, a small painting foreman. The conflict arose when Wang contracted for a construction job, which Mao allegedly seized by force. Wang confronted Mao, who brandished a pistol and threatened to kill Wang. Filled with anger, Wang secretly commissioned someone to buy a five-shot pistol from a foreign ship, intending to retaliate and assassinate Mao Laosan. Mao learned of this and secretly reported it to the Hongkou Police Station. Western Detective C. S. Goodworth and Chinese Detective Zhang Bingchen intercepted Wang Heqing. During questioning, Wang confessed to hiding the pistol at home. He was escorted to the Fifth District, Third Precinct, requesting police assistance in searching his house. Precinct Chief Wen dispatched police officer Zhan Chuan, who accompanied them to Wang's house and found a five-shot pistol and five bullets. The items were taken to the police station for verification. Precinct Chief Wen, considering Wang Heqing's audacity in possessing a gun for revenge, a violation of criminal law, handed the defendant over to the detectives for further investigation. However, the pistol and bullets, having been seized in the interior, were kept in accordance with regulations. Yesterday, a formal report was submitted to the General Bureau for review. Furthermore, it was discovered that Mao Laosan, residing on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, within the jurisdiction of the Fourth District, was also not a good person, engaging in aggressive behavior with weapons in a business dispute. It is requested that all district police stations and detective teams be instructed to jointly apprehend him and severely punish him as a warning to others.</p>
<h3>Two Unusual Birds Suddenly Appear at the National Products Exhibition</h3>
<p>Feathers of Mottled Colors Resembling Phoenixes</p>
<p>They Immediately Flapped Their Wings and Flew South</p>
<p>Around 7:00 AM on the previous morning, amidst a light drizzle, two large birds suddenly flew into the National Products Exhibition Hall in the Penglai Market, Xiaoximen. They perched on the square pavilion of the Yabu Er Electric Factory's booth, standing motionless and appearing very tame. The birds' feathers were mottled with five colors, and their necks were particularly long, resembling the phoenixes seen in paintings. Their size was comparable to that of peacocks. When a staff member from the Dalong Woolen Mill discovered them, a commotion arose as all the exhibition staff rushed to observe. The two birds soon flapped their wings and flew north, perching on the roof of the northern commercial area of the exhibition hall. After about half an hour, they flew swiftly south and disappeared, leaving the onlookers marveling at the sight.</p>

<h3>Installation of Traffic Lights at Laoximen</h3>
<p>Three Bureaus to Jointly Draft a Plan</p>
<p>Requesting Funding from the Municipal Government</p>
<p>Since the widening of Zhaojia Road, Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Fangxie Road, and other roads at the West Gate (Laoximen) of this city, and the opening of Heping Road to connect to Lafayette Road, traffic has become increasingly complex. Therefore, the Public Works Bureau, Public Utilities Bureau, and Public Security Bureau have jointly discussed a plan to install traffic lights and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. Installation will begin soon. The original submission is copied below: "Submission regarding the joint proposal for the installation of traffic lights at Laoximen, including the attached budget, requesting review and approval for temporary funding. Laoximen is a critical transportation hub, and with the opening of Heping Road, traffic has become increasingly complex. Without proper management, not only will traffic control be difficult, but the congested and disordered traffic will also negatively impact the city's appearance and the safety of travelers. Therefore, the Public Utilities Bureau has developed a detailed plan for the installation of traffic lights, which has been approved by the Public Works Bureau and Public Security Bureau. It has been agreed that the Public Utilities Bureau will maintain the traffic lights, and the Public Security Bureau will assign police officers to direct traffic after training by the Public Utilities Bureau. The Public Works Bureau and Public Utilities Bureau have separately estimated the costs of the control tower, traffic lights, switches, and other equipment, totaling 2,180 yuan. With the completion of the Laoximen tram track laying and the upcoming operation of the new route, the need for these traffic lights has become urgent. Therefore, we respectfully submit the plan, control tower design, and budget, requesting that you consider the vital importance of this project for municipal administration and approve the temporary allocation of 2,180 yuan to facilitate its implementation and await your instructions."</p>
<h3>Chinese Textile Factories Massively Purchasing Japanese Looms</h3>
<p>Already Seven or Eight Hundred Looms</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language "Shanghai Daily News" reported that Chinese textile factories in Shanghai, Wuhu, Hankou, and other places, since the implementation of the new tariff rates on May 22nd, believe that the prices of cotton yarn and cotton cloth will inevitably rise. Therefore, they are planning to expand their factories. Recently, the import of looms from Japan has been continuous. According to a survey by a certain organization in this city, the import of looms since the tariff increase has reached 700 to 800 looms. These looms are mostly semi-new, with each priced around 30 yuan. There is even more enthusiasm for placing orders with Japan in the future.</p>

<h3>Italian Envoy Liu Wendao's Grandmother Passes Away</h3>
<p>At the Age of Ninety</p>
<p>Liu Zhangshi, grandmother of Liu Wendao, the current Alternate Member of the Central Committee and Chinese Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to Italy, was born at Chenshi (7-9 AM) on the 19th day of the second month of the 24th year of the Daoguang Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, and was ninety years old. Her family enjoyed five generations under one roof, in great harmony. Recently, she fell ill, and her family sought medical treatment, but her condition did not improve. She passed away suddenly at Chenshi (7-9 AM) on the 23rd of this month at her private residence in Wuxue, Hubei. Her family in Shanghai was deeply saddened upon receiving news of her death. It is reported that they telegraphed Envoy Liu and his family yesterday.</p>
<h3>New Developments in the European Steel Industry</h3>
<p>Belgian Sales Office Establishes Branch in Shanghai</p>
<p>Since the European steel industry has been affected by intense competition and economic downturn, it has made every effort to reorganize. In May of this year, steel manufacturers in Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, and other countries formed an agreement to limit the total annual steel production of the four countries to 6.8 million tons. The distribution is as follows: Belgium 29%, Germany 29%, France 21%, and Luxembourg 21%. Historically, the sale of Belgian steel has largely relied on export companies in London, Hamburg, Antwerp, and Saarlouis, resulting in price discrepancies and making unified management difficult. Various plans have been proposed to remedy this, but none have fully satisfied all parties. Belgian manufacturers lack a centralized sales organization, so most have established their own export companies to sell their products. Among these, the United Sales Office of Belgian Steel Factories is the most well-known. Its export volume accounts for nearly 60% of Belgium's total production, and its affiliated factories are all the most complete and modern steel mills in Belgium. Belgian steel products sold in China amount to over 100,000 tons annually, accounting for over 32% of imports, making it an important market. It is reported that the office has established a branch in Shanghai to facilitate direct transactions with Chinese merchants and enable them to obtain goods at prices set by the original factories. The branch is managed by the Banque Belge Pour L'Etranger at 6 Jiujiang Road.</p>
<h3>Manager of a South Goods Store Commits Suicide by Hanging Due to Poor Business</h3>
<p>Yuan Yugen, Young and Ambitious</p>
<p>Commits Suicide by Hanging Due to Minor Losses</p>
<p>Yitai Shun South Goods and Seafood Store, located at 72 Zhaojia Road, Dadongmen, Nanshi, was reopened in mid-March of this year by Ningbo native Yuan Yugen (23 years old, from Zhenhai) and his fellow townsman Wang Shanqing, with a total share capital of 6,000 yuan. Wang served as the manager, and Yuan as the assistant manager. However, since taking over the business, the store's operations have remained sluggish. With the Mid-Autumn Festival approaching, a recent accounting revealed minor losses. Yuan became deeply troubled, feeling ashamed towards the shareholders, and expressing a pessimistic attitude. Unexpectedly, around 4:00 PM the day before, the store's employee Shi Liqing, along with the cook Wu Haijiang and apprentice Xu Jiankun, went upstairs and noticed that Yuan's door was tightly closed and there was no sound inside. They knocked on the door but received no response. Sensing something amiss, they quickly informed the accountant, who forced the door open. They found Yuan had hanged himself. They immediately took him down and felt that his body was still slightly warm. They rushed him to the nearby Qu Zhibu Hospital for treatment, but it was too late. He had already died. They immediately reported the incident to the Second Precinct of the First District. Chief Liu immediately sent a patrol officer to investigate. The deceased's elder brother, accompanied by the local security officer Pan Baorong, reported the incident to the Local Court for inspection. It was also reported that the deceased had sent a letter to his hometown of Ningbo the day before his death, presumably a suicide note. It is said that Yuan had been engaged to be married in his hometown in March of this year.</p>
<h3>Promoting Fruit Exports to Foreign Countries</h3>
<p>The Guild Has Drafted a Brochure</p>
<p>Pilot Sales of Chestnuts and Ginkgo Nuts</p>
<p>The Ministry of Industry's Bureau of International Trade previously convened an informal discussion with fruit merchants to plan the export of domestic fruits to countries such as England and the United States. It was originally planned to commence when apples came on the market, but due to excessive wormholes in this year's domestic apple crop, the plan was not implemented to maintain credibility. According to Zhang Pansun, Director of the Guidance Department of the Bureau, the plan is to proceed when oranges come on the market. The Bureau and the Fruit Industry Guild have drafted a brochure for chestnuts and ginkgo nuts and requested the Bureau to translate it into English to promote a portion of the products abroad first.</p>
<h3>State-Owned and Private Shipping Companies Competing for Shanghai Sea Route Combined Transportation</h3>
<p>After China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Signed Contract with Longhai Railway</p>
<p>Both Sides Issue Opinions Citing Japanese Examples</p>
<p>The Longhai Railway, in order to develop Northwest transportation and open the new port of Lianyungang, is implementing combined water and land transportation and has signed a contract with China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to implement it from October. China Merchants Steam Navigation Company holds an exclusive advantage in the freight transportation between Haizhou and Shanghai. The operations of private shipping companies operating on the Shanghai sea route, such as Sanbei, Dazhen, and Hezong, will inevitably be affected, so they have all expressed opposition. Therefore, state-owned and private shipping companies are competing for combined transportation. On the first day of the report, a person in charge of China Merchants Steam Navigation Company stated that only state-owned shipping companies are qualified for combined transportation with state-owned railways, citing the Manchuria Railway and Dalian Steamship and Japanese post as precedents to prove this. The private shipping companies specifically refuted this, giving the reasons that (1) Dalian Steamship Company and Japan Mail Steamship Company are not state-owned enterprises and therefore receive subsidies from the government every year, and (2) the above-mentioned combined transportation is all outside of Japan's borders, and those who embrace aggression naturally do not allow profits to flow outward. If it is in the country, with private commercial shipping being much more numerous than state-owned shipping, it does not seem appropriate to cite it as an example.</p>

National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Seal."</p>
<h3>Mechanical Engineering Association Cables Request that Examinations Emphasize Experience</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Mechanical Engineering Association submitted a report to the Minister of Communications, stating: "Regarding the newly promulgated Provisional Regulations for the Examination and Determination of Seafarers, the examination subjects emphasize academics, which should be amended to benefit the shipping industry and encourage mechanical engineering talent. The Department of Navigation under the Ministry issued a letter on September 8, promulgating regulations and implementation rules such as the Provisional Regulations for the Examination and Determination of Seafarers, stipulating that all deck officers or marine engineers on domestic ships must be certified as qualified by the Ministry and issued certificates before they can serve. We see that the Ministry attaches importance to the shipping industry and identifying marine engineering talent, which coincides with the Association's aim to strictly prevent unqualified seafarers. Although the provisions are quite comprehensive, there are still some areas that are somewhat lacking in terms of foresight. We humbly submit this to the Ministry. Since the signing of the Treaty of Nanjing by the Qing Court, foreigners have controlled the customs and shipping rights have been lost. All important seafarers, such as chief engineers, have been foreigners. The government at the time was accustomed to it for a long time and there was no way to remedy it. Those who have a glimmer of light rely on our Chinese seafarers to work hard in the shipping industry and seek to become skilled and experienced, so that foreigners believe that the service ability and efficiency of Chinese officers are not inferior to those of foreign officers. It was not until 1914, when the European War broke out and marine engineers from various countries returned home to serve, that foreigners felt the need and recognized that the Chinese who were practicing marine engineering had the ability to serve as chief engineers. The Marine Department of the Customs then allowed Chinese officers with rich marine engineering experience who passed the oral examination to serve as chief engineers, etc. There are now many Chinese officers serving in this position. But tracing back to the past, all of our Chinese officers relied on rich experience and skilled skills to fight for this right through long-term struggles in difficult and arduous conditions. It was not merely that possessing a diploma and book qualification could bring good fortune. The Ministry's examination of seafarers emphasizes examinations, which is truly in line with the need to select specialized talents. The Association also hopes that the implementation of the examination can create a long-term strategy for traffic safety and eliminate the unqualified. However, there is still a need to consider the examination methods. According to Article 16, Item B of the Implementation Rules of the Provisional Regulations for the Examination and Determination of Seafarers, the written examination subjects for marine engineers include Chinese, English or other foreign languages, general knowledge of mechanics, including mathematics, mechanics, physics, etc., and marine engineering and drawing. A score of 50% or more in each written examination subject is required to pass. According to the marine engineers' operating business, they use marine engines day and night to break through thousands of miles, and they are more than capable of using marine engines. In terms of their rich experience, they certainly have the strengths in the application of the above-mentioned subjects. However, if they are required to present the mathematical formulas or principle diagrams of what they have experienced in order to meet the qualifications for the examination, it is truly not a good way to cultivate marine engineering talent. This is the first reason why the examination should emphasize the results of work experience and not emphasize academics. After 1914, the Customs examination and selection of chief engineers emphasized oral examinations, focusing on the marine engineers' daily marine engineering practice experience and their actual work, without emphasizing books and theories as the criteria for admission. Those who were admitted were all able to perform their duties well, because their experience was rich and their work was detailed. Although they did not thoroughly study books and theories, it was not difficult for them to use their experience to deal with their business. This is the second reason that should be considered. Furthermore, according to Articles 3, Items 5-8 and Article 4 of the above-mentioned regulations, the service years from two to eight years are used as the standard for original-level examination and promotion examination, respectively. It is clear that work experience is not inferior to academic subjects, but the examination focuses solely on academic subjects as the criteria for admission, which is inconsistent with the original purpose. The Association believes that the examination of marine engineers cannot be delayed, but the scores for the oral examination subjects should be set at 50% for marine engineering management application cabin operation experience work performance, etc., 20% for general subjects, and 30% for marine engineering subjects. This matter is related to the good strategy of the shipping industry and the maintenance of marine engineering talent. It is necessary to consider all aspects and not make marine engineers who have been struggling in China's shipping industry feel regret because the examination regulations are not comprehensive enough and place too much emphasis on academic subjects. It is reasonable to submit this to the Ministry of Communications and request that the Provisional Regulations for the Examination and Determination of Seafarers be amended as appropriate and then re-examined, which will be beneficial. This report is submitted to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications."</p>
<h3>Sichuan Disaster Relief Petition Group Appeals for Urgent Relief to Refugees</h3>
<p>He Baoheng, Li Shenpei, and Liu Zizhong, representatives of the Sichuan disaster relief petition group, were entrusted by refugees in northwestern Sichuan last month to go to Beijing to petition the government. After completing their mission, they came to Shanghai to appeal to various charitable organizations, requesting relief so that millions of refugees could have a chance to survive. They have been greatly supported by the Shanghai Sichuan Fellow Townsmen Association and the generosity of various charitable organizations. Recently, the representatives of the group have repeatedly received news from Sichuan that the south has fallen and Guangyuan is in danger. Considering the dire situation, the refugees will have no hope of returning to their former homes. In addition, as autumn deepens, the refugees' current situation is becoming increasingly desperate due to hunger and cold. Therefore, in order to save this urgent situation, the representatives of the group have divided their work. Liu Zizhong has taken the first step to return to Sichuan to report on the petition and appeal situation, and to urge Liu Xiang to immediately release emergency relief to save these survivors. He and Li will remain here for the time being to appeal for relief. Some days ago, Representative He and others went to Beijing again to urge the National Relief Committee of the National Government's Executive Yuan to allocate relief funds immediately and invite Dai Jitao, Shi Qingyang, Lu Hanqun, Sun Yuanliang, and other Sichuanese figures in Beijing to come to Shanghai to assist the Sichuanese in Shanghai in thanking various charitable organizations. He and Li returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to them, the trip was successful and the National Relief Committee agreed to issue the Sichuan relief funds after the Executive Yuan allocates them. Dai, Shi, Lu, Sun, and other gentlemen expressed their support for assisting the Sichuanese in Shanghai in entertaining various charitable organizations and instructed them to ask the Red Disaster Relief Committee of the Fellow Townsmen Association to determine the date as soon as possible and notify them so that Dai, Shi, Lu, Sun, and other gentlemen could come to Shanghai together. It is heard that the Association will hold a standing committee meeting today (the 27th) to decide all matters.</p>
<h3>Fire Insurance Claim Group Continued to Seek Compensation from Jardine Matheson Yesterday</h3>
<p>Detectives on Alert in Advance</p>
<p>No Incident Occurred</p>
<p>The fire insurance claim association of the Zhabei disaster area negotiated with various foreign firms for compensation, resulting in the injury of representatives. As reported in yesterday's newspaper, representatives from the association continued to seek compensation from Jardine Matheson yesterday morning. The police had dispatched a large number of detectives in advance to prevent the crowd from entering. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>(Second Claim) The fire insurance claim association of the Zhabei disaster area, due to the assault on the 25th of its representatives by Western police officers at the Jardine Matheson foreign firm on Guangdong Road, resulting in injuries to policyholder Feng Qibiao and others, resolved to seek compensation from Jardine Matheson for the second time yesterday. Anticipating further assault and detention by the police, the association's chairman, Wang Zhixiang, led over a hundred representatives and policyholders to No. 1 Guangdong Road to demand fire insurance compensation.</p>
<p>(Detectives on Guard) The police, having learned that the policyholders would return for a second claim on yesterday morning, dispatched a large contingent of Chinese and Western detectives to No. 1 Guangdong Road at nine o'clock, stationed at the main entrance downstairs to prevent further disturbances. The situation was very tense. As expected, around ten o'clock, a large group of claimants, representatives, and policyholders arrived, intending to enter the firm to demand compensation. However, upon reaching the entrance, they were stopped by Western police officers and were not allowed to enter. After a long standoff, the claimants requested to send representatives inside to negotiate with the insurance department of Jardine Matheson, which was agreed to by the Western police officers.</p>
<p>(Representatives Negotiate) With the permission of the Western police officers to allow a few representatives to enter, representatives from the claimants, Wang Zhixiang and Zheng Shaokui, went upstairs to meet with Chen Songyuan, the compradore of Jardine Matheson. The crowd waited outside. The representatives negotiated with Chen, requesting the payment of fire insurance money to aid the policyholders in the disaster area. Chen then conveyed this request to the Western insurance department officials. The Western officials stated that this matter was not a problem solely for Jardine Matheson, but a matter concerning all insurance firms. Jardine Matheson could not take unilateral action. The matter of fire insurance payment in Zhabei had been submitted to the insurance association for discussion. Once a resolution was reached, they would all comply. The representatives were asked to negotiate with the insurance association. Upon hearing this, the representatives had no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>(Letter of Inquiry) After the representatives left, they made a statement to the public and returned to the association on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. As for Butterfield &amp; Swire, the association, having not received any response, would send representatives to inquire. Regarding the compensation issue with Jardine Matheson, they were instructed to negotiate with the insurance association. The association immediately resolved to first send a written letter to the insurance association to urge a resolution and provide a definitive response, and then decide on a course of action after receiving a reply.</p>
<h3>Lawyers' Association Sends Letter Requesting the Court to Strictly Enforce Bail</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers' Association sent a letter to the Shanghai District Court and the First and Second Special District Courts, stating in brief: According to member Chen Zhigao's report, it was reported that the 369th meeting of the Central Political Conference discussed Commissioner Ju Zheng's proposal that the government should issue a clear order to all provinces regarding criminal offenders who have been detained in various prisons and detention centers but whose cases have not been decided, to strictly enforce bail for those detained pending trial and to reduce sentences for those convicted. It was resolved that those detained pending trial should have bail strictly enforced according to law, and the National Government should issue a clear order to this effect; and that convicted prisoners should have their sentences reduced as appropriate, and the Executive Yuan should order the Ministry of Judicial Administration to draft detailed measures for review. Therefore, the courts should comply with the order to strictly enforce bail according to law for those detained pending trial in order to alleviate prison overcrowding. However, in fact, the courts do not strictly enforce bail according to law for those detained pending trial. The courts should be notified to pay attention to the strict enforcement of bail for those detained pending trial in order to comply with the Central Government's intention to alleviate the suffering of the people and issue a general order to strictly enforce bail. This matter was submitted to a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members, which resolved to forward a letter to the courts to pay attention to strictly enforcing bail according to law for those detained pending trial. The corresponding letter is hereby delivered, hoping that your court will investigate and implement it accordingly, truly cherishing public friendship.</p>

<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Cables Request to Lift the Ban on Setting Off Firecrackers</h3>
<p>Safeguarding the Livelihood of the Firecracker Industry Workers</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Nanjing Executive Yuan and the Zhenjiang Provincial Government yesterday, stating: (Omitted titles) On the 11th and 14th of this month, according to a letter from the Firecracker Industry Association, it was reported that on August 29th, it was reported that the Songjiang County Government, upon order of the Provincial Government, determined that the sound of firecrackers and guns was easily confused, and that in the event of a bandit alarm in the future, it was especially feared, so it decided to take measures to ban them, and immediately ordered the town and village chiefs to order the town and village police to use gongs to announce that from September 3rd, it would be strictly prohibited. The sound of firecrackers rings twice in succession, unlike the sound of guns, which rings once or up to five or six times, and the sound it emits, although difficult to describe in words, is clearly and obviously different. Even ignorant men and women know this. Moreover, in recent years, thieves have risen everywhere in our country. The reason for this is that there are too many people and too little gruel, resulting in many unemployed people in society who cannot make a living. As a result, they disregard their lives, take risks, and become thieves. As the saying goes, people are driven by hunger and cold, and have no sense of shame. This is not false. Speaking of those who work in the firecracker industry, there are statistics everywhere, and there are tens of thousands in each place. The number of their families who depend on them for support is even unknown. If a strict ban is imposed, those who directly and indirectly depend on them for a living will inevitably have nowhere to turn and become thieves, and social order will inevitably become more chaotic. If this is the case, it will not only fail to appease the people, but will harm them. It is truly feared that it will backfire. The Chamber of Commerce, in view of this, for the sake of the livelihood of the industry and the country and society, dares to offend your esteemed council and requests that you forward a letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Government to take into account both the livelihood of the firecracker industry people and local security, and to deliberate on a flexible approach, and to instruct all subordinate county governments to strictly comply. We will be deeply grateful. It has always been the case that the order to ban the setting off of firecrackers is only issued when martial law is enforced in the locality. There is currently no military activity in the province of Su, and the locality is peaceful, which is not comparable to the time of martial law. Guns have been popular in China and have been used by the army for a long time, but firecrackers have an even older origin, and have been commonly used in civilian celebrations and mourning ceremonies for a long time. In times of order and tranquility, there have never been any misunderstandings or panics. If they are banned regardless of whether martial law is in effect, it is tantamount to exterminating the firecracker industry, which will cause hundreds of thousands of shopkeepers who sell firecrackers and workers who make firecrackers in various provinces to lose their jobs, which will not help to maintain order and tranquility, but will only increase unemployment and panic, leading to hidden dangers in the locality. From ancient times, governing is about nurturing the people first, and enabling them to support themselves second. Today, the country's financial resources are not able to carry out large-scale operations to enable the unemployed to cultivate the land, but the policies issued are to deprive the people of their self-sufficiency. It is believed that this is not permissible. Recently, the Dutch East Indies, Batavia, also issued an order prohibiting overseas Chinese from setting off firecrackers. The overseas Chinese protested against this, saying that the government should not interfere in religious rituals. Now, a similar ban is being issued in the country, which makes it even more difficult for overseas Chinese to negotiate with foreign countries. The firecracker industry is under internal and external pressure, and can only tend towards extinction. Therefore, we dare not avoid offending you and sincerely request that your esteemed council review and approve the lifting of the aforementioned ban in order to maintain the livelihood of the firecracker industry. This will be in the public interest. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce kowtows.</p>
<h3>Reconciliation in the Case of Feng Qiwen Being Sued by Xiao Lin Daiyu</h3>
<p>Feng Qiwen, a Ningbo native residing at No. 12, Dapu Lane, Jin Shenfu Road, French Concession, formerly employed at the Guangdong Bank, now forty-one years old, previously, due to having no sons, married the prostitute Zhu Mao Yuan (age twenty this year, also known as Xiao Lin Daiyu A Yuan), a Zhenjiang native, as a concubine at the end of the twentieth year, and rented a house to live together. In the fourth month of the old calendar this year, she gave birth to a girl, and suddenly a difference of opinion arose, and he abandoned the girl and the child. Mao Yuan and her mother, Zhu Li, hired lawyers such as Tu Zhenhu to act as agents, and filed a criminal self-accusation with the First Special District Court, accusing Feng of seduction and abandonment, and also filed a civil lawsuit, requesting a judgment to pay for living expenses. Feng also hired a lawyer to defend himself. The details of the interrogation have been reported in previous newspapers. The case was repeatedly summoned to court, and the parties were ordered to reconcile out of court, but the two sides could not resolve the matter due to the large difference in the amount of the civil lawsuit.

The robbers drove four men and ten women in the room into a corner under surveillance, and then went upstairs to search the Lin's and several tenants' homes for gold and silver jewelry, clothes, and silver dollars, valued at 1,163 yuan. They carried the stolen goods and fled. Afterwards, Lin Zhang and others reported this to the Huisi Police Station, requesting an investigation, but it has been three years and the case has not been solved. Until 10:30 am the day before yesterday, Cui Shunk, Ma Derong, and others from the Xinzha Police Station learned that Wang A'gen, a Shaoxing native and a robber in this case, was hiding at No. 23, Xinkaihe, French Concession. They then went with the French Police Station detectives to arrest Wang and brought him back to the police station. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the First Special District Court. Yao Tang, a lawyer from the police station, stated the case, saying that several tenants lived at No. 1685, Haining Road, and were all robbed. Today, only Lin Zhang is present, so he requested a postponement for further questioning. Lin Zhang also testified about the robbery, but could not remember the faces of the robbers because three years had passed. When asked, the defendant Wang A'gen confessed that three years ago, when I went to Bao Yu Lane, No. 12, Yanzi Nest, French Concession to smoke opium, I met a friend, Su A'san, who said that Xiao Guangdong had reported that a certain family on Haining Road, Hongkou, was hiding opium, and asked if we wanted to rob it together. We then discussed it there. At that time, Xiao Guangdong and A'qing each held a handgun, and A'san and I went empty-handed. When we arrived, I only stood outside the door. The three of them went inside. After a while, they came out and met at Baoyu Lane to divide the spoils. Later, according to Xiao Guangdong and others, they robbed a total of 20 liang of opium, sold it for 30 yuan, so I was given 5 yuan, etc. After Judge Wu Tingqi verified the confession, he ordered Wang to be detained and to be questioned again in seven days.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To whom it may concern, I recently read a news item in your newspaper on the 25th of this month that the police at the South Station were inspecting items and detaining those without invoices, causing merchants to complain. This is not in accordance with the facts. It was found that on the 22nd of this month, when police officer Dai Shangxian was inspecting goods at the South Railway Station, he saw Wang Malin carrying cloth and looking flustered. When asked if he had an invoice for the cloth and where he bought it, he was dumbfounded and could not answer. He also offered four jiao of small foreign money to bribe the officer to let him go. Afterwards, our district chief ordered him to present solid evidence or a reliable guarantor. Wang Malin then claimed that the cloth was bought from a teahouse and that the seller could not be found, and that he did not know any stores in Shanghai. Because the circumstances were suspicious, the witness was sent to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. On the 24th, Shou Kanghua shipped many rubber overshoes without invoices. When the police officers inquired, Shou attempted to escape, so he was taken to the district. Afterwards, the Ximeihua Clothing Store provided proof, and he was released. There was no "detention of goods carried by passengers without invoices."</p>
<p>The facts are as stated above. Please investigate, correct, and disclose the truth. To the Shenbao. Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, Second District Office. September 26.</p>

<h3>American Professional Tennis Player Tilden Defeats Cochet</h3>
<p>The United States Wins the Championship in Straight Sets</p>
<p>-The Old General Still as Powerful as Ever-</p>
<p>(Paris Dispatch, 25th, Havas) The professional tennis match between France and the United States continued today. American player Tilden defeated French player Cochet with scores of 6-3, 6-4, and 6-2. Although Tilden is already 40 years old, his skills shown today are still worthy of being the world's number one tennis player. Tilden's techniques and strategies were sufficient to control the opponent everywhere. Cochet, on the other hand, showed some fatigue today, and the balls he hit were not as accurate as before. Next January, American player Barnes will give up his amateur status and become a professional player. At that time, Cochet will travel west to New York with Pallaya to compete with Tilden and Barnes. In the doubles match, Tilden and Pence defeated Cochet and Pallaya with scores of 6-2, 4-6, 6-1, and 6-4. In total, the United States won with four matches.</p>

<h3>Jinan Continues to Win the Jiangda Swimming Championship for Three Years</h3>
<p>Jiaotong Second, Fudan Third, Daxia Fourth, Guanghua Fifth</p>
<p>Jiaotong Lacks Long-Distance Talent, Women's Competition Temporarily Changed to Performance</p>
<p>Jiaotong Yu Rongbang Breaks Jiangda 50-Meter Freestyle Record</p>
<p>The third Jiangda Swimming Competition concluded yesterday. Jinan won the championship for the third consecutive year with a total of 25 points. Jiaotong came in second with 18 points, Fudan third with 14 points, Daxia fourth with 8 points, and Guanghua fifth with 1 point. Yu Rongbang of Jiaotong broke the Jiangda record of 30.9 seconds held by Lian Xiannan of Jinan in the 50-meter freestyle with a time of 30.2 seconds, making it one of the most exciting events of the competition. The other events did not show any progress. The women's group was changed to a performance due to only one or two participants. The scores of each school and the results of the finals are recorded below.</p>
<p>School Scores (1) Jinan University, 25 points, (2) Jiaotong University, 18 points, (3) Fudan University, 14 points, (4) Daxia University, 8 points, (5) Daguanghua University, 1 point,</p>
<p>Reasons for Jinan's Victory: Jinan's only strong opponent is Jiaotong. Their results in short-distance and backstroke are not as good as Jiaotong, ranking below them. The decision of victory or defeat lies entirely in the two long-distance events of 400 meters and 1500 meters, and Jinan's average talent takes the lead. There is talent in every event, and they score in every event. This is why they win.</p>
<p>Reasons for Jiaotong's Defeat: Jiaotong had a strong momentum to defeat Jinan and win the championship. They overwhelmed Jinan in the two short-distance events of 50 meters and 100 meters. Chen Chunxiu's 50 meters was particularly distinctive. Chen Hu's backstroke and breaststroke were also better than Jinan's. Unfortunately, they lack talent in the two events of 400 meters and 1500 meters, and have to let others take the high seat.</p>
<p>Tense Situation: The competition between Jinan and Jiaotong was the fiercest, with a very small difference in scores. After the 100-meter backstroke, each had 18 points. The last event, the 1500 meters, will decide the championship. However, looking back at Jiaotong, there is no talent in the final list. Therefore, Jinan can easily win.</p>
<p>A New Record: A new record was created yesterday. Yu Rongbang of Jiaotong broke the Jiangda record of 30.9 seconds held by Lian Xiannan of Jinan in the 50-meter freestyle with a time of 30.2 seconds.</p>
<p>Diving Performance: Results of the diving performance competition: (1) Chen Jiazhen of Jinan, (2) Bao Xindi of Jiaotong, (3) Pan Baozhen of Guanghua, (4) Li Linyan of Fudan.</p>
<p>Women's Performance: Because there was only one participant in the women's group, Liu Mali, it was changed to a performance. Ms. Liu Mali and Gong Xiji performed the 100-meter backstroke.</p>

<h3>World Long-Distance Running Expert Nurmi's Amateur Status Question</h3>
<p>International Athletic Association Cancels His Qualification</p>
<p>Finnish Athletic Association Claims No Violation</p>
<p>(London Dispatch) A very interesting question has arisen in the world of sports regarding Nurmi's status. Last year, the International Amateur Athletic Federation believed that Nurmi had violated amateur rules and was not allowed to participate in the Olympics. However, the strange thing is that Nurmi recently won the Finnish championship again. According to the Finnish Athletic Association, Nurmi has not violated any rules. Not only Nurmi personally believes that he is an amateur, but the Finnish Athletic Association also believes so. Therefore, he is allowed to compete in Finland. Nurmi has not left amateur sports, nor does he have any such intention. He continues to work hard to break world records and says that he does not run for money. As a result, such a special situation has arisen. Finland calls him an amateur, but the International Athletic Association cancels his qualification. According to the rules of the International Amateur Association, no amateur athletes may compete with him after Nurmi's qualification is canceled, nor may they compete with athletes who have competed with Nurmi.</p>
<h3>Chen Baoqiu Should Change to Participate in the Decathlon, Wang Fudan</h3>
<p>Since Chen Baoqiu created a new record of 2880.24 points in the five-event competition at the Jiangda Games, there has been a lot of discussion, believing that this gentleman will surely win the five-event championship in the upcoming National Games. I alone believe that Chen's five-event record, without waiting for the National Games, will be broken by others at the Shanghai City Games and encounter a strong opponent. Because calculating Chen's scores in each event, four of them are not as good as Wang Jihuai, only the discus throw is better. However, Chen's performance in the discus throw fluctuates, with no certainty. Therefore, when everyone praised Chen's five events, I alone held a different opinion, believing that it would be better for Chen to participate in the decathlon than in the five events. Before the City Games, I had talked to Chen's coach and Chen himself several times, advising Chen to change to participate in the decathlon. Because I had made precise calculations, Chen's decathlon score is not only invincible in the city, but also has few opponents in the National Games. However, Chen and Chen's coach, because Chen is not good at pole vaulting, and there were several other people at the time, without careful examination, believed that my advice to Chen to change to participate in the decathlon was for other purposes, completely for my younger brother Wang Jihuai to win the city's five-event championship, using a strategy of diverting the tiger from the mountain. Therefore, I dared not mention the matter of Chen changing to participate in the decathlon again. Now that the city games are over, the right and wrong can be known without debate. Now, I will list the minimum possible scores for Chen in the ten events:</p>
<p>Event Score Points</p>
<p>100 meters 12.6 seconds 66.80</p>
<p>Long Jump 6.15 meters 644.75</p>
<p>Shot Put 12.66 meters 6.00</p>
<p>High Jump 1.60 meters 538.00</p>
<p>400 meters 58.6 seconds 31.52</p>
<p>High Hurdles 19.6 seconds 20.00</p>
<p>Discus Throw 32.4 meters 498.02</p>
<p>Javelin Throw 41 meters 450.00</p>
<p>1500 meters 5 minutes 20 seconds 500.80</p>
<p>Pole Vault 00</p>
<p>If Chen can maintain his usual performance in each event, it is not difficult to get 57-800 points, not counting the pole vault. I wonder if Chen thinks so?</p>

<h3>Zhang Yuanruo's Constitutional Theory</h3>
<p>The entire book of 200,000 words will be published by the China Book Company-</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Yuanruo, an expert in public law, has served as a law professor and dean of various universities. He has written extensively and is enthusiastic about academics. Recently, he has written a book on Chinese constitutionalism, totaling 200,000 words, which is broad and profound. It is divided into two parts, the first part is a general discussion of the characteristics of China's constitutionalism, the crux of constitutionalism, and the basic principles and special problems of future constitutional making. The second part discusses the latest principles of modern constitutional transformation and the latest trends in the evolution of modern constitutions. The second part is the main discussion, first discussing the general principles of constitutional making, and then discussing the basic principles of the rights and obligations of the people. The theory is detached from the traditional legal framework, and is especially aimed at the special circumstances of our country's plans. Then it discusses the central political system and the local system.

<h3>Dawn of Production Education</h3>
<p>Huangdu Chicken Farm to Expand</p>
<p>The China Education Construction Society and the Provincial Huangdu Rural Normal School jointly established the Huangdu Chicken Farm to promote education. It is located in Huangdu Town on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. It is learned that it has been in operation for more than half a year. The farm completely adopts scientific methods to hatch chicks. Great attention is paid to the air and temperature of the chicken house, the distribution and nutrition of feed, and the research and treatment of chicken diseases. On the one hand, it provides practical training for students of Huangdu Rural Normal School, and on the other hand, it recruits worker students in order to combine production and education. There are currently about 300 laying hens and dozens of breeding chickens. It is heard that the board of directors was held at the Li Da Academy in Jiangwan the other day. Directors Teng Songshi, Sun Yuanshu, Zhang Zhonghuan, Wu Zhiqian, Chen Ruiwen, and supervisors Zhou Linwu and Zhang Shiqiao attended. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to increase the capital in the spring of next year and expand the farm again. A report will be compiled and published to the society around Double Ten Day. It is also planned to borrow the New Bao Vocational School on Parker Road as a temporary liaison office in Shanghai. There are currently fat and tender roosters and large eggs for sale. It is heard that the Education Construction Society also plans to hold a general meeting of members in Huangdu after the Mid-Autumn Festival. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion at that time, and the farm will definitely make a great contribution to the future of production education.</p>

<h3>Cleverness</h3>
<p>— Si Su</p>
<p>Modern people, after all, are not as good as ancient people, daring not to stray too far from the facts when speaking, are extremely clever: moreover, they understand each other tacitly, agreeing without prior consultation, only in being a clever method, everyone is self-taught, able to do it instinctively, it cannot be said that they are imitating, it is really because modern people all possess clever minds. Just like undeclared war, the Japanese are the most skilled at winning battles, as they did against Imperial Russia, ｜The date of the Russo-Japanese War was December 24, 1904, but in fact, on the 22nd, Japan had already begun military action, unexpectedly attacking Lushun and blockading it, thwarting the spirit of the Russian army. At the same time, the Combined Fleet attacked the Russian fleet anchored in Incheon, Korea, and also achieved a great victory, with the Russian ships completely destroyed. Japan first won victories on both sides, and then officially declared war on the 24th. The Russian Navy was defeated in Incheon Bay, and could hardly engage in naval warfare. It had to send a fleet from 8,000 miles away to fight, but it was defeated by the Japanese Navy, which waited leisurely, ambushing it in the Sea of Japan, resulting in a great defeat, and the outcome was decided. I remember that Russia once appealed to the international community for injustice, but the victor ultimately wins, who would blame Japan for not being honorable after its victory!! So too with us, ｜This does not only refer to the undeclared war of September 18th and January 28th. In the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, Japan also fought first and then declared war, the same as against Russia. ｜Thus, it won every battle. But this clever method is not only the forte of the Japanese, Bolivia and Paraguay are equally good at it. This is one. Another example is the propaganda of war reports, which is not only the forte of a certain country. Both Bolivia and Paraguay have deeply understood the essence of it, so the Bolivian-Paraguayan War, since it began more than a year ago, no one knows who is winning or losing. Recently, the National News Agency has another telegram, saying that according to Bolivian sources: the Bolivian army, under the command of German General Bidet, has repelled the attacking Paraguayan army; and on the same day, the Paraguayan government's war report also claimed: to have annihilated four regiments of Bolivian elite troops. The National News Agency can only transcribe the war reports of both sides, and cannot express an opinion on who is winning or losing. Journalists are still unclear about the actual war situation, and ordinary people are even more at a loss. Losing a battle is originally considered the most embarrassing thing by those involved. With this method, the shame of losing a battle is forever concealed, and instead, it is transformed into the most glorious "repelling" of the enemy, or "annihilating" the enemy. This is why it is called cleverness, I am afraid that even ancient people could not have dreamed of it!</p>
<h3>Stone Fight</h3>
<p>— Lanxi</p>
<p>When autumn arrives, I think again of the bad habits of the residents of my hometown. －－ Fighting "stone fights."</p>
<p>The so-called "stone fight" means that this kind of war does not use guns and artillery weapons, but completely uses stone blocks. The participants in the war are, of course, ordinary simple-minded and stubborn adults and youths. They live in the countryside, and the concept of family is very deep, living together as a family, and working together. If there is encroachment on their fields, or insults to their "own people," the solution is a battle. So they hold a "stone fight." They do not understand what "the sorrowful beauty" is, but "letters of challenge" must be exchanged. The place and date are agreed, and they are eager to give the other party a good beating.</p>
<p>Their battlefield is mostly on the top of the mountain, with both sides occupying half of the mountain, and each side arranging the proper places for attack and ambush. Each side uses large baskets to carry countless large and small stones, which are sharp and hard, causing people to shudder. And what is more interesting is that they also prepare a lot of "cooked tobacco," - a kind of cheap tobacco often smoked by friends in Guangdong, coarse tobacco leaves, strong in taste, temporarily rolled up in paper to smoke - prepared to apply to the head after it has been pierced by stones to stop the bleeding.</p>
<p>Stone fights are mostly held in autumn - perhaps to take advantage of the coolness?</p>
<p>When I was in the countryside, I was not allowed to watch the stone fights much, partly because I was young, and partly because the family rules were strict - my grandmother did not allow me to be infected with bad impressions. But in the last year, I was fifteen years old, and I secretly went with my classmates, walked a long way, and went to the mountain to watch. The situation was tense, and you couldn't help but cover your head to watch. Large and small stones flew back and forth like shuttles on the east and west sides of the mountain, and both sides shouted and killed, as if facing a great enemy. There were deaths and injuries from time to time. ｜——At that time, my heart was always uneasy.</p>
<p>However, I have been in Shanghai for nine years, and I don't know if "stone fights" have been banned or not? People in the south are bloody, and often use a battle to see who is superior, but it is also too barbaric.</p>
<h3>A Scene of Swindling</h3>
<p>— Drunken Fool</p>
<p>Thieves can be stupid thieves. But swindlers cannot be made without clever people. Because swindlers must have meticulous minds and clever means, in order to prevent people from seeing through their flaws, get into their traps, and swindle people's property. Therefore, the skills of swindlers are worthy of people's exclamations. It is a pity that cleverness is misused, "abandoning the right path and not following it," and ultimately becomes a degenerate person in society.</p>
<p>Tobacco and paper shops are the easiest to be cheated by swindlers. Like a few days ago, a tobacco and paper shop in Nanshi, this city, was cheated out of about sixty dollars by the method of peddling copper coins. Recently, a small tobacco and paper shop near the alley where I live was also visited by a swindler. Although the loss was not much, the swindler only used a small trick. Now I am writing it out, so that those who open tobacco and paper shops can see it and pay attention.</p>
<p>A well-dressed Mr. A stepped into the tobacco and paper shop and said to the person inside the counter: "I want to buy six dollars worth of ×× brand cigarettes." The boss accepted this big business and hurriedly packed the cigarettes and handed them to him. A then took out a wallet and was about to pay. Suddenly, he showed a surprised expression and said: "Oh, I don't have enough money here. I live at number ×× in this alley, surnamed ×. Because there is something going on at home tomorrow, I am buying so many cigarettes. I will write you a note with my address, and you send someone to deliver the goods and pay the money." The boss said: "Everyone is a neighbor. In that case, I will have someone go with you now." So he ordered an apprentice in his teens to take the cigarettes and follow him. He entered the alley, turned a corner, and arrived. A stepped into the gate of number ××, and suddenly said to the apprentice: "Give me this thing, and then go get two dollars worth of soap, hurry up and come back, and I will pay you together." The apprentice handed over the cigarettes, and even looked inside, seeing A naturally go in. He obeyed the order meticulously and returned to the shop to get a big bag of soap. When he arrived at the house, he could not see A. He shouted at the top of his lungs: "Hey, the soap is here." A woman's head stretched out from the window upstairs and replied: "Who wants soap, you sent it to the wrong place." The apprentice was stunned for a moment and explained the reason. The woman also said: "This is a respectable family, there is no such person." The apprentice then realized that he had been cheated and burst into tears. Later, the boss also came upon hearing the news, asked about the situation, and could do nothing. He just cursed angrily, "Met a damn cheat". The apprentice still took the soap and went back quietly!</p>
<h3>A MODERN MISS'S DAY</h3>
<p>— Bo Chen</p>
<p>When the first half of the day in the office comes to a halt, Miss C from a certain mansion just gets up, lazily, and wearily.</p>
<p>She walks gently to the wireless radio, tunes it to a foreign radio station, and immediately, a quiet and moving Western melody begins to play. She sits on the soft sofa, smoking a "cigarette," humming along with the song on the record.</p>
<p>Casually flipping open the newspaper, several seductive advertisements jump into her eyes: ×× Company's 1933 most "modern" clothing grand sale. Then, "A-Er" has the car ready, she jumps in, and the car rolls down the asphalt road.</p>
<p>Returning from ×× Company, Mr. Zhang is sitting in the reception room. Ah, she bravely embraces him, a deep and sweet kiss.</p>
<p>"I'm taking you to see 'Feng Qiu Huang' this afternoon, my darling must do me the honor."</p>
<p>"Ah::::"</p>
<p>Lunch is at three o'clock. She busies herself with a half-day beauty treatment. Happily, amidst the sounds of voices and rustling clothes, she steps into the cinema, whispering sweet nothings::: Her heart is filled with the joy of spring.</p>
<p>She walks out of the cinema with a light smile.</p>
<p>"Vienna," A-Er asked her, and after her reply, the car rolls down the asphalt road again. | Late at night.</p>
<p>When dawn is just breaking and the workers are going to work, Miss C from a certain mansion has just gone to sleep, lazily, and wearily.</p>
<h3>FOURTH COMPANY COMMANDER OF THE NORTHEAST</h3>
<p>— Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: Aching Heart Still Sends Blessings, Hasty Military Affairs Secretly Shift Troops</p>
<p>Even though Ji Zhi was facing away from this Zhang San, he couldn't help but blush when he heard these words. He was silent for a moment, and then asked: You rickshaw pullers, whenever you stop at a place, you like to talk about the people who live there, are you just making things up? Zhang San was a little unconvinced when he heard this, so he stopped, turned his head, and looked at him, saying: Second Master, if you don't believe me, let's take a little detour, and walk along Haidian Street, if we're lucky, we'll see them walking down the street arm in arm. Ji Zhi suddenly replied: That's fine, so the two of them didn't say anything, the rickshaw pulled away quickly, heading towards Haidian Street. Ji Zhi sat in the rickshaw, seeing the Haidian market street getting closer and closer, he suddenly stomped his foot on the footrest several times and said: Don't pull forward, I'm not going to Haidian. Zhang San said: Now that we're here, there's no other way to go except through Haidian. As he said this, the rickshaw continued to pull forward as usual. Ji Zhi couldn't stop him, and he was too embarrassed to jump out of the rickshaw, so he sighed twice in the rickshaw. Zhang San was a little strange in his heart, taking him to Haidian was a very normal thing, why did he seem so unhappy. So he pulled the rickshaw for a while, and couldn't help but turn his head to look at Ji Zhi a couple of times. Ji Zhi was very afraid that he would see that he was jealous. So he smiled and said: If you want to take me to Haidian, then I'll let you take me. Zhang San laughed and said: Really, I'm not wronging you, they're very close, they often go to the milk tea shop hand in hand to talk. If you don't believe me, go to the milk tea shop and ask around. Ji Zhi smiled and said: Do I look like someone who likes to meddle in other people's business? Zhang San laughed, and pulled the rickshaw quickly to Haidian Street. Ji Zhi thought to himself, he had lived on Haidian Street before, so even if he took a rickshaw and passed through the street, it was a very normal thing, so why make things difficult for himself. So he kept a straight face and let Zhang San pull him along. (198)</p>
<p>World Oddities</p>
<h3>THE CHINESE NATION IN THE EYES OF THE FRENCH</h3>
<p>— Zhu Mei, from France</p>
<p>France is worthy of being called a civilized country because all its facilities are on track. Not many French people are well-educated, and they do not have the idea of harming others. They absolutely love their rights, but their love for obligations is exactly the same as their love for rights. It is not difficult to imagine what kind of people they would think the Chinese nation is with this kind of mindset. Especially what we give them from the facts, that is, the impression that the Chinese give them after coming to France and contacting them, and secondly, the influence that their education gives them. In Europe, France is considered to be better to the Chinese, although they do not like the Chinese very much, because almost all the people they approach are small vendors, carrying a small suitcase, unable to speak French, with yellow, dark, thin, and small faces, and untidy clothes. These Chinese not only live in Paris, but also scattered throughout all the cities and remote fields of France. And Chinese students with knowledge, they are of course difficult to approach, they are all studying in universities in big cities, and cannot run to small places for no reason. Therefore, as long as they have seen the Chinese, they always add many bad mocking adjectives when they talk about them. If they accidentally meet a clean and polite Chinese student, they often regard them as Japanese. Speaking of their education, French secondary education is the most corrupt for China. I have investigated their history and geography textbooks, and personally reviewed their maps, and found many surprising things. Their world history's description of China is entirely a century ago, with faces not only yellow, but also with a tail on their heads. Even more strange is that a woman's bound feet are specially placed on the table and photographed. Regarding this matter, I explained to the French people I knew, I said that this is already a historical relic. Didn't France also have many terrible bad habits in the past? However, they did see these kind of small-footed women in Paris in 1933. At that time, I thought those French people were spreading rumors, or maybe they were Chinese old ladies; later, after my investigation, there are not only many small-footed women in Paris, they are still peddlers, carrying a small baby on their backs, not only not old women but also very young. If such women are used to specify that all Chinese women are like this, isn't it too wronged? But in this way, they use historical events from more than a hundred years ago as textbooks, and now they still seem to think it is fresh. Secondly, speaking of geography, I think the French geography books are probably written by the Japanese themselves. How do you say that? That is, even with the old China, there are twenty-two provinces without any discount, but their descriptions of China only focus on the south, without mentioning how many provinces China has. So they ask me which province I am from? I said Sichuan, they can't understand that China has a Sichuan. And the map is even more absurd. No matter which country in the world, there is a special map. Even a small country like Japan has one equal to the size of England. China is only on a map of Asia, and the entire China only has four provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Yunnan, and Guangdong. The remaining provinces, such as Sichuan and Hunan, are absolutely not there. There is a Tibet province, and the color of Tibet province is exactly the same as the color of England and the British colonies, and the color of Manchuria is the same as Japan. At that time, I asked a friend who was a geography teacher in a middle school, is that map recently published? He said it has been more than twenty years. In addition, I also saw a world map, each country distinguished by color, and at the same time, each country used a person to describe the unique spirit of that country. For example, the United States is a very well-dressed gentleman, holding a bookkeeping book in his hand, indicating that this is a country that manages commerce, Germany, England, Poland, Russia, Japan, etc.::: everything that should be there, and the Japanese are barefoot and hard-working, but there is no China on the entire world map! This is a world map, and it is a textbook for all low-level schools in France. Let us think, what is the impression of the Chinese nation that the French are cultivated from such education?</p>

Observing the situation of this past three-quarters, there has hardly been a single day with good signs entering our eyes. Tracing back to after January 28th, vitality has not recovered, and various industries have suddenly entered a bleak state. Starting from the beginning of the week yesterday, with the facts of the American cotton and wheat loans completed, and the spot goods coming to China in a steady stream, the turnover in the economy seems to have the possibility of circulating, and it will not be as stretched as before.

<h3>COPPER COIN SHORTAGE, LARGE MARKET IS ALSO SHORT</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan silver dollars remained unchanged, with both the morning and afternoon markets at 834 yuan and 5 jiao, with no rise or fall from the previous day. The transactions made were 4,500 jiao in the morning market and 3,000 jiao in the afternoon. The Guangdong silver dollars were 786 yuan in the morning market, and the afternoon market rose by another 3 jiao, to 786 yuan and 3 jiao. The result was a rise of 5 jiao compared to the afternoon market on the previous day. The transactions made were 85,000 jiao in the morning market and 40,000 jiao in the afternoon. The shortage of spot goods in the copper coin market was particularly severe, and the demand for square-holed coins was high. Therefore, it continued to contract every day, and yesterday, it showed a new low price of 310,000, which was 500 wen shorter than the previous day. 31,930 strings were traded, with a total value of 10,300 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<h3>FLUCTUATIONS IN THE SECURITIES AND PUBLIC BOND MARKET</h3>
<p>The situation in North China is serious... Many [sellers] flocked to market.</p>
<p>Military cuts fell 2.6 yuan... Much like a limit down situation.</p>
<p>Trading was extremely lively... Future prospects are still cloudy.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced huge changes in various bond markets. The situation in North China became increasingly serious, and the market was timely at the last day of the September futures, and the bulls panicked greatly. The long position of a certain silver company of two to three million surged into the market. The initial situation at the opening of the morning market was extremely bad, and there was a limit down situation. Because the military cuts fell by 1.5 yuan, the military cuts fell sharply by 2.65 yuan this month due to the frantic selling on the 21st. Long-dated futures were immediately bought in, so the market price of long-dated futures exceeded that of the near-dated ones. This abnormal situation was completely forced by the short squeeze. Thereafter, the situation gradually entered a normal path, but the decline did not diminish, and gradually became peaceful, with limited falls, such as only a small four-jiao decrease in long-dated salt tax. This kind of wave, one is that the September futures were only on this day, one is that the environment was unfavorable to the long position, and even more because it had been brewing for more than a month, once it fell sharply, it would also be fierce. Trading was extremely active, and the second session was not opened until 2 p.m. The market price was relatively stable due to some of the short positions taking advantage of the situation, but it was still mixed and chaotic, with highs and lows alternating, and people's hearts were extremely flustered. The afternoon opening did not take place until 5 p.m., but the shorts had a lot of offsetting, the trading surged, and the prices returned to 35 jiao or so, depending on the stock. The closing was approaching 9 p.m., the market was still a short squeeze, near soft and far strong, and the prices were slightly better by 34 jiao. As a result, those whose market prices fell, such as military cuts, and those who did poorly lost five jiao to over one and a half yuan, and also fell more and rose less. The long-dated unified salt tax and gold shorts all rose well, by two or three jiao to over four jiao. Today there is only one month of October futures, and its volatility will be no small matter, and the price may not be able to return to strength immediately. The future prospects are still cloudy. The total volume traded was approximately 25 million or so.</p>
<h3>NEW YORK STOCK MARKET DECLINED UNIFORMLY</h3>
<p>New China Trading Company reported on the 25th that the New York stock market declined throughout the day because the government did not approve of the tendency of inflation and the gold dollar rose. At the close, because the French franc trended strongly, the market outlook was again good. Although there was speculative selling, the market was not greatly affected, and the temporary market situation seemed to be uncertain. The "wheat" market price fell, and brokers were quite eager to buy. Manufacturers also bought December futures, and the well-known local speculators bought at the close. With few harvests, the market situation was firm. The "cotton" market situation was stable, and the direct inflation method was at least temporarily shelved. The suggestion that each pound of cotton can receive a government loan of 1 jiao in public bonds is now quite powerful, but if the cotton is still in the hands of the farmers, then the cotton price will also be difficult to determine. There were a few hedge selling in the South, quietly waiting for the development of the future. The "silver" market situation was uncertain, and the close was quite stable. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 1,310,000. The Dow Jones Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Compared to the Previous Day</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 98.03 down 1.75 20 Railroad Stocks 43.51 down 1.08 20 Utility Stocks 26.25 down 0.61 40 Bond Stocks 84.55</p>
<h3>COTTON YARN RELIEF EFFORTS WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ACHIEVE</h3>
<p>The Yarn Price Decline Strengthens</p>
<p>The yarn market is trending down, and the decline is quite strong because of the rumor the day before that the government would allocate 20 million yuan to relieve the cotton industry. It is deeply feared that it will be difficult to achieve, and the situation in North China is still serious. The situation in Beijing and Tianjin has again given rise to fear, so the selling has risen sharply. Although a certain factory has tried its best to buy, the trend is unstoppable, and a single tree cannot support a collapsing building.</p>
<h3>THE HUMAN YARN STANDARD DROPPED SHARPLY BY TWO YUAN</h3>
<p>The human yarn standard opened on the forward market, and the market sentiment was very weak due to the lack of buyers in the market. Prices for each month fell by 0.9 jiao to 1.457 yuan. In the afternoon, the current month was especially weak, and there was a rumor that a certain factory would receive 8,000 bales of yarn, but the market sentiment was still soft, and prices fell another 1.1 yuan, with the remaining months falling 34 jiao. The total volume traded for the day was 42,500 bales. The statistics of sales showed that Dafeng sold 3,900 bales, Changfeng sold 3,950 bales, Yuanda sold 1,300 bales, and Xincheng sold 1,450 bales. The purchases made were Ruida buying 1,600 bales, Yuanda buying 1,700 bales, Yichang buying 2,000 bales, Renfeng buying 1,000 bales, Dachang buying 1,350 bales, and Tonghe buying 1,450 bales. The closing prices are as follows, with the rise and fall in the human yarn standard shown below:</p>
<p>Closing Price Rise/Fall Balance 12th month 1838 down 1866 300 9th month 1798 down 2022 400 1st month 1848 1873 200 10th month 1814 1963 800 2nd month 1855 1840 600 11th month 1828 1872 300 Total 338 300</p>
<h3>SPOT YARN CONSUMPTION IS WEAK</h3>
<p>The movement of spot yarn is relatively flat. The statistics of purchases made by various groups throughout the day were 1,117 bales. Prices fell by 5 jiao. The purchase amounts of each group are as follows: Guangdong 130 Datong 10 Zhenjiang 5 Yunnan 760 Inland 85 Shantou 45 Industry Peers 60 Changsha 20</p>
<h3>American Cotton and Standard Yarn Both Fall, Standard Flower Turns Towards a Weary Path</h3>
<p>After rising for three consecutive days, the cotton market suddenly plummeted today, and the downward trend is still strong. This is due to two reasons: first, the weakening of American cotton; second, the sluggishness of the yarn market. Although the Ningbo merchants sold off slightly, buyers are still relying on adverse weather conditions, the delayed arrival of cotton on the market, which hinders cotton picking, and although Yao cotton arrives daily, sales are still smooth, and the selling price is 1.8 yuan higher than before. Therefore, the amount absorbed is still not relaxed. In October, both the bulls and bears have considerable fighting power, and the amount of contracts is accumulating more and more, making the future difficult to predict.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Falls by Fifty or Sixty Cents</h3>
<p>The Zheng Standard market opened in the morning, and due to continuous light rain and a slight drop in American cotton prices, market sentiment was still good. However, after two or three rounds of trading, the yarn market was sluggish, and the cotton market suddenly fell. Each month fell by forty or fifty cents. In the afternoon, each month fell by another five cents to one and a half cents. The total volume of transactions for the whole day was 100,860 dan, Chunji 3,400 dan, Dafeng 2,500 dan, Taixing 3,000 dan, Maijin Yuanda 14,100 dan, Tongfu 4,000 dan, Gengfeng 6,100 dan, Tonghe 2,300 dan, and Yichang 2,000 dan. The closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Closing Price Changes Account Balance January 4080 Down 199,500 October 4175 Down 60 241,400 February 4090 60 149,500 November 4095 55 224,400 Total 1,036,100 December 4080 45 232,300</p>
<h3>Raw Cotton Factories Still Operating Flexibly</h3>
<p>The demand for spot cotton is not weak. The source is estimated to be 3,600 bales of Yao cotton and 1,809 bales of Tongzhou cotton. The opening prices for spot cotton are listed on the left:</p>
<p>Chen Ling sells cotton for 46.00, Hengfeng Factory purchases 256 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory. Tianjin fine velvet 44.50, Yufeng Factory purchases 300 pieces for delivery in October and November. Shaanxi cotton 42.00, Hongzhang Factory purchases 100 pieces of spot goods for delivery to the factory. Xiasha cotton 40.25, Shenxin Factory purchases 500 bales of spot goods for delivery to the factory. Huoji cotton 39.00, Dafeng Factory purchases 2,000 bales for delivery in October and November. Yuyao cotton 37.60, Guangdong merchants purchase 550 bales of spot goods for delivery at the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Overseas Cotton Markets Show Mixed Trends</h3>
<p>Yesterday's American cotton market conditions initially fell due to Southern arbitrage sales, then rose due to purchases by industry peers, and finally weakened again due to long position liquidation. As a result, spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 2 to 9 points. The Liverpool cotton market saw spot prices rise by 8 points and futures prices rise by 3 to 8 points. Egyptian cotton spot prices rose by 5 points. The Bombay cotton market weakened along with securities. As a result, Pingar rose by 2 rupees, and Omra and White Broach both rose by 1 rupee and 2.5 points. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated 25th):</p>
<p>Cotton America Compared to Previous Day US Currency English Cotton Compared to Previous Day US Currency</p>

<h3>Rice Experiences Price Fluctuations, Imported Currency Scarce and Stands Out</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the River Below source number 356, after rising all the way in recent days, the trend was quite stable. However, as the day became drizzly, sales first decreased. Fortunately, not much arrived, and people's hearts were still firm, and the market remained strong. Moreover, the situation in North China was serious, and the Northern merchants' contracts were greatly affected, resulting in few transactions, shifting downstream. Statistics show that there were few scattered contracts, and only about 600 contract bags. Therefore, the prices of various types of rice from different merchants, including thin rice, thick rice, aged new Du Yangjian, River Below new japonica rice, etc., all fell by a few cents. The thin rice market is also inevitably at risk of falling back. Due to the scarcity of goods, imported currency is uniquely popular, and prices continue to rise by one or two cents.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 25 or 26 ships arrived from various routes downstream of the river. Various contracts on the market were sluggish, and the market was broken: japonica rice was high and stable, and medium-grade and lower grades were weak. New and aged Yang Du Jian, Tuan Jian, Jiaobai Jian, Xinbu Jian, West New Japonica, thin rice, and new and aged guest Jian were all flat and weak. The price of white currency was tight by several cents.</p>
<h3>Ke Xian Rice and Fujian-Guangdong Rice Sell Well</h3>
<p>- Prices Continue to Rise by Nearly a Dime -</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Ke Xian rice market saw brisk arrivals and sales. At the point of origin, due to the good market conditions in recent weeks, vendors were active, and there were many new arrivals and goods in transit. Fujian and Guangdong were particularly eager because rice merchants in Hong Kong and Guangdong were entangled in tax disputes over foreign rice, and they all paid attention to products from the Yangtze River region. The Fujian merchants were originally active in contracting, and their interest has intensified in recent days. Yesterday, merchants from Shantou and Guangzhou also contracted for shipments, and the market sentiment was very good. Fortunately, the origin market was also strong, and prices began to rise by nearly a dime. In the future, the Fujian and Guangdong merchants can continue to contract, and the sources can also be active. The Ke Xian rice market is gradually gaining a foothold. If the foreign rice tax is implemented nationwide in the future, the rural economy of rice production in the five provinces of Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang can be revived. Yesterday, due to unresolved price negotiations, there were no transactions of foreign rice. Ke Xian rice sold included 200 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice, 700 bags of Hunan machine-milled Jing rice, 2,000 bags of brown rice, 2,000 bags of Nanjing car Xian rice, 3,500 bags of factory Xian rice, 200 bags of Wuxi machine-milled rice, and 400 bags of brown rice. The main destination was Quanzhou in Fujian Province, followed by Fuzhou, Shantou was also active, Guangzhou was still in the trial loading stage, and the Ningbo merchants only contracted for 200 bags of Jiangxi machine-milled late rice.</p>
<h3>Flour Turns Upward Due to Offsetting</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market initially showed flatness and then turned upward. The quoted prices for foreign wheat, in both Chicago and Canada, were only favorable by four points. Therefore, at the opening, people's hearts were weak, and the current month opened at 1.875 cents. However, in subsequent rounds, because manufacturers had no intention of selling off and some even made offsetting purchases, market sentiment gradually improved. By the time the market opened in the afternoon, transactions in each month were quiet. Because the situation in the north was turbulent, real sales merchants were naturally watching. The lack of trading was due to this reason. Although the current month is approaching delivery, there are many non-industry long positions who are unwilling to close out immediately, and manufacturers are also unwilling to lower prices to buy in, resulting in a stalemate. However, as the day is approaching, the future is bound to change. As a result, the current month was only better by 2.5 cents, October was better by 1 cent, November was better by 1.25 cents, December was better by 1.5 cents, January was better by 1.75 cents, and February was better by 1.25 cents.</p>
<h3>Period Wheat Steady Before Delivery</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market, after opening in the morning and afternoon, showed an initial flatness followed by a continued upward trend. The quoted price for foreign wheat fluctuated very little, and people's hearts had little basis for judgment. The current month was the last day, and both long and short positions had to close out unless they had actual goods for delivery. Therefore, the current month had been as low as 3.8 yuan on the 4th, but then short covering led to a gradual rebound. However, there were actually quite a few with goods, so the price rebounded to 8.8 cents in the afternoon, and then loosened again. It was heard that the goods awaiting delivery were about 30+ cars, which were still bought in by the trade, while transactions in other months were very few, and prices were stable. As a result, the current month was better by 4 cents, October was better by 1 cent, November and December were better by 2 cents, and January was better by 3 cents. The spot wheat market was quiet, and prices varied. Wuhu wheat opened at 3.93 yuan, Pudong wheat at 3.65 yuan, Hezhou wheat at 3.73 yuan, Gaoyou wheat at 3.77 yuan, Nanjing wheat at 3.6 yuan, and Wuxi wheat at 3.54 yuan, for a total of 2,300 bags.</p>
<h3>Jiujiang Rapeseed Opens Down Seven Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, 500 bags of Jiujiang rapeseed were sold at a price of 6.8 yuan, which was contracted by the Dong merchants. This was because the goods had been in port for a long time, and the merchants were unwilling to sell them cheaply and kept them in storage. However, the market situation has remained depressed so far, so it is difficult to keep them for long. Yesterday, they began to sell them off at a reduced price. It is noted that the goods were previously offered for sale at 7.5 yuan, and yesterday's price fell by 7 cents.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Locally Produced Refined White Sugar Rises by Five Cents</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a rebound in both customs gold and standard gold, and the trend was stable. The association set the price of 24 coarse sand white ordinary goods at 21.8 yuan, and there were transactions. There were still no transactions of 20 medium sand white sugar. The original prices for new and aged Dutch red sugar were quoted but no sales were made. Taikoo Sugar B Mark was 21.7 yuan, and W Mark was 21.55 yuan, unchanged. The prices of locally produced refined white sugar rose by 5 cents each. China National and Guohua No. 1 was 20.75 yuan, No. 2 was 55 cents, No. 3 was 35 cents, No. 4 was 15 cents, Top Grade was 20.95 yuan, Zhenji No. 1 was 20.75 yuan, and Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 declined. Chaoqing opened with more than 100 bags at a price of 15.9 yuan.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods: The First Batch of New Xinghua Round Longan Debuts</h3>
<p>- Jiecun Zheng Er Approximately 140 Yuan -</p>
<p>The harvest of new Xinghua dried longan this year is also poor, and large grains are particularly scarce. It is learned that the first batch of goods arrived yesterday, totaling about 2,000+ pieces. The approximate standard asking price for Jiecun Zheng Er should be around 140 yuan. The previous rumor of a sell-off is clearly a fabrication.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: European and American Silk Sales are Declining</h3>
<p>(British White Factory Yarn Price Drops Dramatically) In the London market, due to the dumping of Japanese silk fabrics, the demand for raw silk from various silk mills is sluggish. In addition, Japanese silk is sold cheaply, and the price of Chinese silk has plummeted. Grade A white factory yarn is only offered at 8 shillings and 1 penny per pound, and Grade B is 7 shillings and 10 pence, each down 1-2 pence. Tug silk is only 731-760 yuan per bale in domestic currency.</p>
<p>(Jiaxing Autumn Cocoons Shipped to Shanghai) The autumn cocoon markets in both North and South Jiaxing have ended, and autumn dry cocoons are now being shipped to Shanghai in batches. In recent days, more than 900 bags have been loaded onto Shanghai-Hangzhou trains from Jiaxing Station.</p>
<p>(Artificial Silk Sales are Not Smooth) Yesterday, only the Sichuan-Hubei merchants submitted 26 boxes of futures for September and October of Shuang Liu Hai, Lan Ning Zi, Samsung, etc. brands at the association, with prices ranging from 179.5 yuan to 157.25 yuan net.</p>
<p>(Foreign Merchant Silk Sales are Quiet) Yesterday, the overseas silk telegrams sent to Shanghai offered extremely small prices. Various European merchants suppressed prices, and Chinese silk merchants were unable to sell at a loss. The market atmosphere was increasingly quiet. Yesterday, only Liena and others sent telegrams for more than 100 bales of factory yarn. Assurance must await the telegram transfer. There were no reports of current silk transactions.</p>
<h3>Luzhuang Zhenmei Tea Sales to Europe Continue Smoothly</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Zhenmei green tea from Lvzhuang in Wuyuan and Tunxi was strongly favored by the British merchants Xiehe Foreign Firm. Other firms such as Jinlong, Tongfu, and Fushi also searched for it. The market was smooth and the selling prices rose. However, the prices of Zhenmei and Xiumei and other types of tea have fallen by 4-5 yuan because there are many teas of inferior quality on the market. Gongxi green tea was also relatively weak. The remaining stock of Qimen black tea was only a thousand boxes. Yesterday, the Russian merchants' Xiezhuhui purchased 300 boxes at prices ranging from 67 yuan to 90 yuan. The market was also quite good.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods and Woolen Cloth: Prices Rise, Sales Decrease Sharply</h3>
<p>The trade in woolen cloth has recently been somewhat sluggish. The enthusiasm of buyers has turned sluggish due to the price increases by industry peers. However, most of the goods sold in the industry are at a loss because increased tariffs have sharply increased costs. The price increases are to maintain capital. Yesterday, Degi Fengshenbang Huate woolen cloth increased to 5.5 yuan, Sishitutu Zhigong woolen cloth to 6 yuan, 1339 Dafacai plain serge to 4.25 yuan, and Wulu Jindouhua foreign cloth to 6 cents. Buyers disliked the prices and stopped buying, resulting in a stalemate between the two parties and a sharp decrease in transactions.</p>

<h3>August in Hangzhou</h3>
<p>— Yu Dafu</p>
<p>August in the lunar calendar in Hangzhou is also a very lively month. Starting from the fifteenth day of the seventh month, osmanthus and chestnuts are on the market. Entering August, there are even more chestnuts, and the osmanthus flowers in the Manjuelong, Nan Gaofeng, and Wengjiashan areas are even more fragrant and intoxicating. The name "Osmanthus Month" for August can only be truly understood after personally visiting Manjuelong.</p>
<p>In addition to the osmanthus flowers in August and the Mid-Autumn Festival on the fifteenth day of the eighth month, which is common in China, Hangzhou also has the Qiantang River tide on the eighteenth day of the eighth month.</p>
<p>The autumn tide of the Qiantang River has been famous for a long time. Legend has it that it is because King Fucha of Wu killed Wu Zixu and sank him in the river. Wu Zixu was dissatisfied, and his ghost was causing trouble. There is a passage in Lunheng that refutes this matter, and it is said with good reason: "The Confucian book says, 'King Fucha of Wu killed Wu Zixu, cooked him in a cauldron, put him in a bag, and threw him into the river. Wu Zixu was angry and made waves by the water, drowning people.' The statement that King Wu killed Wu Zixu and threw him into the river is true, but the statement that he was resentful and made waves by the water is false. Moreover, Wei chopped Zilu, and Han cooked Peng Yue. Wu Zixu was brave, but no more than Zilu and Peng Yue, but the two men could not become angry in the cauldron. Wu Zixu was also the same. He first entered the cauldron and then entered the river. Why was his spirit timid in the cauldron and brave in the river? Why is his anger inconsistent before and after?" However, although the reasoning of Lunheng is sufficient, the power of legend is ultimately very great. To this day, not only at the head of the Qiantang River, but also on the banks of the Fei River in Luzhou City and in coastal areas around lakes in Jiangsu and Fujian, one can still see the temple of Grand Master Wu with a white horse and a plain carriage.</p>
<p>The tide of the Qiantang River must have been even larger in ancient times than it is now. This can be understood from the fact that the eminent monk Shi Baoda of Lingyin Temple in the Tang Dynasty recited spells to prevent the river tide from hitting the mountains on the lake, and that Emperor Gaozong of the Southern Song Dynasty watched the tide only at the Gao Tai of the pagoda outside the Hou Chao Gate in Jianggan. Now, one must go east to Haining or Wubao or Babao to see the line of silver sea tide crest. This can also be seen in Ruan Yuan's Yan Jing Shi Ji Zhejiang Tu Kao, and the sand swelling in the river is the biggest reason why the tide does not come far.</p>
<p>Also, in the fourth year of the Kai Ping era of the Liang Dynasty, King Qian Musu of Wu built a sea embankment and ordered hundreds of strong crossbows to shoot at the tide head, only outside the Hou Chao Tongjiang Gate. To this day, the iron cow town castings along the Haining River are clearly the relics of King Wusu, things made by later generations. (I remember the year of the iron cow casting was in the Shunzhi era of the Qing Dynasty, and the words printed on the cow's body were still faintly discernible.)</p>
<p>The changes in the world are truly terrible, but even now, there are still quite a few residents of Hangzhou who make a small fortune by relying on this autumn tide and doing this business!</p>
<h3>The Dream of the Literary Canon</h3>
<p>— Da Yi</p>
<p>I have already published an article entitled "The Dream of the Taoist Canon" in Free Talk. Someone asked, "It is already the case that the characters in The Scholars are good at arguing over the Taoist canon: do you have anything to say about the characters in The Writers also arguing over the literary canon?" I said, "Those who argue over the literary canon have been favored by the ancient prose writers since the Tang and Song dynasties. By the time of the Qing Dynasty, parallel prose revived, and the likes of Ruan Yuan and Wang Zhong almost won the orthodox position for parallel prose. If one speaks of its origin, the Taoist canon is the same source as the literary canon. The Sage Confucius bears two shoulders, one shoulder of the Taoist canon and one shoulder of the literary canon. When the Tao is not lost, the culture is not lost. It is tied to one person, the so-called since the birth of the people, there has never been someone like my Master."</p>
<p>The dream of the literary canon has always been held by the writers of the Southern and Northern Dynasties. Liu Xie wrote The Literary Mind and the Carving of Dragons, and its preface roughly says: "When I was over thirty, I once dreamed at night of holding a ceremonial vessel painted with red lacquer and following Confucius south. When I awoke, I was happy and said, 'Great is the difficulty of seeing a sage. Could it be a dream bestowed on me, a small child?' To praise the sacred will, nothing is better than annotating the classics, but the scholars of Ma Zheng have already elaborated on them with precision, and even with profound interpretations, it is not enough to establish a school. Only the use of literature is actually the technique of the classics. The five rites rely on it to be completed, and the six codes use it to be effective." Therefore, I picked up a pen and mixed ink, and then began to write about literature. It can be seen that Liu Xie dreamed of Confucius and implicitly shouldered the literary canon himself, while letting the Taoist canon go to the pedantic scholars of the classics. It is a pity that he attacked heterodoxy and converted to Buddhism, which is the same disease as those who vainly shoulder the Taoist canon today, bringing shame to the past sages without knowing it.</p>
<p>Jiang Yan was famous for his writing when he was young, but his talent and thoughts declined slightly in his later years. He once dreamed at night that Zhang Jingyang said to him, "I sent you a bolt of brocade before, now you can return it to me." Jiang Yan searched in his arms and got a few feet to give to him. Zhang was greatly angered and said, "How can you cut it all up!" He also dreamed of seeing Guo Pu, who said, "I have a pen in your place for many years, you can return it to me." Jiang Yan searched in his arms and got a five-colored law to give to him. Jiang Lang only said that he dreamed of inheriting the traditions of the Jin poets Zhang Jingyang and Guo Pu, and dared not remotely inherit the literary canon of the Sage Confucius. Could it be that he was exhausted in his later years that he was willing to make this particularly self-denying statement?</p>
<p>When Ji Shaoyu was young, he once dreamed that Lu Chui gave him a bundle of blue carved brushes and said, "I can still use this pen. You choose the best one for yourself." His writing became more powerful because of this. When Zheng Zhuo was young, he once dreamed of meeting Huang Kan on the road. Kan said, "Zheng Lang, open your mouth." Kan then spat into Zheng Zhuo's mouth, and his understanding of principles improved. Li Guang extensively read books and had talent and thought, comparable to Xing and Wei. He once wanted to go to court early, took a nap, and suddenly woke up, saying to his wife, "I seemed to be sleeping but not sleeping just now. Suddenly I saw a person come out of my body and say, 'You are working too hard, and your spirit cannot bear it. Now I am leaving you.'" He was dazed and unhappy because of this, and fell ill after a few days and never recovered. Dreaming of the poetic soul leaving the body and the poet dying, dreaming of the literary giants giving pens and the literary thoughts advancing, dreaming of the philosophers giving saliva and the principles becoming refined - why did the literati of this era often have strange dreams, and could dreams actually be verified? In those days, writers were fond of boasting, and the habit was deeply rooted. Entrusting dreams to show differences was one of their techniques for exaggerating that they were inheriting the literary canon of the ancients or their predecessors. Even writers who were not worth mentioning would also engage in vain exaggeration: Wu Maiyuan liked to elevate himself and despise others. Whenever he wrote a poem and got a satisfying phrase, he would throw it to the ground and shout, "What is Cao Zijian worth mentioning!" Shan Chao heard and laughed, saying, "In the past, Liu Jixu's talent was not as good as the author, but he liked to criticize people's articles. Jixu is trivial, how can he be worth talking about!" As for Maiyuan, what is he doing? Also, Yuan Gu of Chen County valued his writing and said to people, "My poems should be blocked by great talents, otherwise they will fly away." These kinds of arrogant people can hardly be explained except by what modern psychologists call megalomania.</p>
<h3>Travel Notes (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Tianma</p>
<p>"Bring his baggage in! An umbrella and a quilt are also okay!" The accountant ordered again.</p>
<p>Then the crying started, begging the master for mercy, and floating above the crying and begging sounds were scoldings, insults, and the cries of pain from being hit. It was all mixed together.</p>
<p>Every time I encountered such a tragedy, I couldn't bear to watch it, but I couldn't bear not to watch it. This tragedy is precisely a symbol of rural bankruptcy.</p>
<p>The poor farmers came to the city with golden dreams, and then returned to the countryside with the sadness of disappointment. They were wandering and displaced.</p>
<p>Three Lonely Hills</p>
<p>The boat passed Lonely Hill, just at a beautiful sunset, the setting sun sinking into the water, the colors of the clouds changing, the scenery like a painting. Standing on the highest deck of the boat, I saw from afar that verdant spot, as if it were going to flow eastward with the water in the surging river. The closer the boat got, the more Lonely Hill stood tall and upright in the heart of the river, its feet standing as firm as iron, scornfully glaring at the turbid flow under its feet. The surging and roaring river water rushed head-on, but when it reached its feet, it could only helplessly drag the sighs of defeat and escape past its side.</p>
<p>Seeing Lonely Hill, I thought of Jun Mountain in my hometown again. But Jun Mountain is bigger than Lonely Hill, and the lake water is not as turbulent as the river flow. We certainly don't have to worry that it will be swept away by the stormy waves one day. As for Lonely Hill, it is only the size of a green snail, and it is standing in the turbulent river, but it seems to be more stable and serious than Mount Tai. No matter the wind and rain, no matter the angry tide that overwhelms the sky and the sea, it cannot shake its feet. This really makes me sincerely feel respect.</p>
<p>Mr. Tao Xingzhi once had a poem about Lonely Hill:</p>
<p>"Who says Lonely Hill is small? Its feet are firmly planted; it commands the waters of the Yangtze River, winding around it on both sides." Another poem is:</p>
<p>"Who says Lonely Hill is small? Lonely Hill is old; East and West going ships, how much do they know about floating and sinking?"</p>
<p>Of the two poems, I like the phrase "feet firmly planted" the most. I feel that only that sentence is the most powerful, the most touching, and only that sentence is truly worthy of praising Lonely Hill.</p>
<h3>In a Third-Class Carriage</h3>
<p>— Ba Jin</p>
<p>－One of the Travel Essays</p>
<p>Sitting on a train doesn't seem like a pleasant thing, and a third-class carriage is certainly not a comfortable place, but I have spent part of my time in a third-class carriage in the past year or two. It seems that some people have said that they envy the life I live. They would not know these situations.</p>
<p>I had been saying I was going to leave for a week or two. Some friends would meet me on the road and ask, "Why are you still in Shanghai?" I couldn't find a second sentence except for the short reply, "I'm leaving tomorrow." Indeed, I was preparing to "leave tomorrow" every day, but unexpectedly, this "tomorrow" dragged on for a week or two. The injustice is that some people suspected that I was deliberately deceiving them.</p>
<p>One evening, after seeing Mr. and Mrs. W off on the train, I walked to the China Travel Service with M. Neither of us was familiar with the roads in Shanghai. At that time, I had not decided to leave that night, nor had I decided to go to the China Travel Service to buy tickets. We were just walking on those relatively flat roads, talking about the problems that had been tormenting our young hearts for so long. We could not see the surrounding scenery. M and I, like each other, had a picture of the future engraved in our hearts. We believed that this picture showed a stage that human society must go through in the process of evolution. However, others did not acknowledge it. They said we were deceiving ourselves with fantasies. We did not feel that we were wrong. The picture could not be washed away. When it was first engraved in our hearts, it had taken a lot of the craftsman's effort and a long time. For us, it would always be a source of inspiration, constantly bringing us hope, especially after our friend X brought good news from a distant Mediterranean ancient country a few days ago. Although M and I were both filled with emotions of parting, we did not feel sad. Our conversation at that time was all about the future, and those were beautiful words.</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, but we didn't notice it; the lights came on, and we didn't notice it either. The bright and beautiful prospects loomed vaguely before our eyes. Unintentionally, we walked to the China Travel Service on Sichuan Road, and we went in to buy tickets.</p>
<p>"When are you leaving?"</p>
<p>"Tonight."</p>
<p>I answered without hesitation. When I got out the door, I realized: I'm leaving tonight. At this moment, I suddenly felt how unfortunate it was to waste time on trains and ships.</p>
<p>×××</p>
<p>The luggage was packed temporarily, which didn't take much time. When Mr. and Mrs. V saw me off at the station, it was only a little after ten o'clock, and the train was not scheduled to depart until twelve o'clock. I didn't need anyone to see me off at the station, but Mrs. V said, "Walking alone is lonely, and it's pitiful not to have anyone to see you off." I couldn't refuse them either.</p>
<p>On the platform, we found M. He was waiting for us there. Now no one would feel lonely anymore. V was carrying my rattan bag, and we got on the train.</p>
<p>There were few passengers in the carriage, and there were many empty seats. I took out the bedding from the rattan bag and spread it on the long bench, thinking that I would definitely be able to sleep comfortably tonight. (To be continued)</p>

<p>"But you say the iron smelter factory has nothing to do with you, then you are mistaken, this is definitely not unrelated to you."</p>
<p>"I don't know," Maria Fortovna said timidly, and then asked: "Do you know everything that is written in the newspaper?"</p>
<p>"Is there anything I don't know," Dingjia said with a wry smile: "Of course, I know everything."</p>
<p>"Do you hope to start work on May 15th?"</p>
<p>Dingjia smiled:</p>
<p>"Of course, I hope so." After a moment of silence, he said firmly: "The whole country hopes so, so I hope so, and you..."</p>
<p>Like this······"</p>
<p>"What, me?" she said in surprise.</p>
<p>"Of course, you also hope so." Dingjia said decisively: "Of course, you also hope so, aren't you an intellectual worker who is advancing with us, how can we not understand this?"</p>
<p>"But I don't quite understand." she said.</p>
<p>"Maybe that's how it will be," Dingjia agreed: "This kind of thing often happens, I myself didn't understand it in the past. I am sixty years old this year, but I have only just understood it now. I am sixty years old, but you are probably not even forty years old."</p>
<p>"I'm thirty-seven," she said, blushing.</p>
<p>"That's right, it must be because of age, although I am sixty this year, I am not old yet." His expression was unusually serious, as if he was talking about a great principle.</p>
<p>"What kind of person do you think I am?" he asked solemnly.</p>
<p>"I don't know."</p>
<p>"I am a degenerate, a rogue class."</p>
<p>"What?" Maria Fortovna never expected that Dingjia, who looked like a farmer, would say such a thing, and was really taken aback.</p>
<p>"A rogue class." Dingjia repeated.</p>
<p>"A wandering drunkard, but now, I am a member of the shock troops, a proletariat, I have only walked a single path in my life,"</p>
<p>"But now, it has turned into two feet, and every step is firmly on the ground, surrounded by factories and construction projects."</p>
<p>He said goodbye to Maria and strode off to the opposite side. (The End)</p>

<p>Informal Essay</p>
<h3>On Hope by You Yi</h3>
<p>People nowadays say; "Let us not grieve over the past, nor should we yearn for the future, we must grasp the present, the present."</p>
<p>What is called "yearning for the future" is "hope."</p>
<p>"Hope" for people can sometimes ignite an upward passion, but sometimes it can also lead to discouragement due to disappointment.</p>
<p>"Hope" originally has no limit, and the goal is not easy to achieve.</p>
<p>In fact, "hope" is ultimately inseparable from people, for example, my "hope" when writing this piece is that I can write it more substantively, like an actor performing on stage, and be able to win a little more applause. And when this piece is written and sent to the newspaper office, I hope it will be published sooner.</p>
<p>However, "hope" is, after all, mostly elusive. When I was in elementary school, at about ten years old, our Chinese teacher gave us a composition topic called "My Ambition," so many innocent elementary school students used their simple brains, stretching out paper and sucking on brushes, with undivided attention. Some said they wanted to be great politicians like Zhuge Liang: some said they wanted to be great inventors like Watt: some also said they wanted to be invincible generals like Sun Tzu, and some wanted to be great industrialists, and some wanted to develop mineral resources. At that time, didn't I also take it upon myself to help the world and the people, and my ambition was unmatched? But for more than ten years, I have been running around and experienced what is called "worldliness," and although my lofty aspirations have not completely faded, I have no longer the dreams of those years.</p>
<p>But "hope" still exists after all. The reason why I can still drag my wounded body and struggle on the road of life is because "hope" is encouraging me and urging me from behind; I not only "hope" but also believe that I think there is still hope for China now. At the same time, I believe even more that the light will eventually come.</p>
<p>Of course, "hope" is a bit close to self-deception, but rational hope is right. And achieving the "goal" is also easier.</p>
<p>When I work, I grasp the reality, but I am not just working hard in silence, I am also looking to the "future" on the one hand, I am looking at how much road is left to my "hope"? And sometimes I also look back at the "past," but I am not "grieving," but "reviewing the old to learn the new."</p>
<p>However, the "hope" on the other hand is a bit unflattering, just like the ticket price of the ×× lottery is one yuan, and the first prize is indeed 50,000 yuan, who would not want to spend an old silver dollar to try their luck, and if they hit it, it would be 50,000 times the interest, and they would immediately rise to the top and become a wealthy man, what a lucky thing! However, however, after all, only one person out of 500,000 people hits this so-called "luck," and 499,999 people will be disappointed!</p>
<p>After all, "hope" is mostly elusive.</p>
<p>However, when "realistic goals" are used to replace "rational hope," then it is indispensable.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between "Production" and "Consumption" by Er Chu</h3>
<p>Often, we know very well that the evolution of society is based on mankind's continuous "production" and continuous "consumption." Because consumption seeks to satisfy the universal desires of mankind, - and the desires of mankind increase with the needs of the times - the so-called universal desires are the essential elements of life, such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Mankind has been busy with "production" morning and night, without rest, all for the sake of "consumption." In other words, it is to satisfy one's own desires. Then, there should be no objection to the saying "production" for "consumption," right?</p>
<p>Desires that are above the waterline are extravagant hopes.</p>
<p>To "consume" in order to satisfy a certain extravagant hope, that should be called "waste."</p>
<p>China is a country with backward "production," this should be an undeniable fact, right? Chinese people, except for the only farmers - and now the countryside has collapsed, what else can be said - work hard from early morning to dark, year after year "producing," most of the others only know how to "consume" - even waste, especially the general masters, gentlemen, wives, and young ladies in the city, they, they are doing the so-called "higher Chinese" under the command of foreigners, what do these "slaves of the masters" know about "production," maybe they do know, can "produce," that is to "produce" for foreigners, living in foreign houses, riding in motorcycles, promoting foreign goods,··· almost not even eating Chinese rice, but eating foreign bread. - In fact, there are many - alas! Rural collapse, backward production!</p>
<p>Therefore, the abnormal phenomenon of "consumption" exceeding "production" is bound to appear. Foreign goods take the opportunity to flood the market, forming what is now called China as an "international market"! It is very heartbreaking to say!</p>
<p>The exhibition of this phenomenon is caused by the mutual surpassing of "production" and "consumption." Because "production" dominates "consumption," "consumption" dominates desire, and desire dominates "production." If a certain transcendence or lag breaks the interrelated cycle, a considerable horror is bound to be revealed. This kind of horror is the social unrest and the instability of personal life. If "production" surpasses "consumption," of course, there will be worries about overproduction. (The current European and American countries are in this situation.) "Consumption" surpasses "production," and it affects economic panic. Our China is properly shouting and clamoring about the chaos of backward "production" and economic panic, which constitutes social unrest and the instability of personal life, only being tempted by the "consumption" of Europe and the United States, and eagerly seeking to imitate. Thus, it automatically alienated the "national concept" and the "path of self-salvation," and all consumption tends to be Europeanized, "producing" for foreigners and promoting foreign goods, rescuing overproduced Europe and the United States. However, the "production" of Europe and the United States is put aside, and it is still in the intersection of the 18th century handicraft industry and the 19th century iron industry, far from the "production" of Europe and the United States!</p>
<p>In short, "production" and "consumption" must have equal development in order to gradually seek progress. This geometric rule, in any case, tells us like the "ㄧ." Who dares to deny it?</p>

<h3>A Person in a Stormy Night by Jian Ping</h3>
<p>It was a stormy night. Pearl-like raindrops were pouring down rapidly and intensively; the roaring wind almost lifted the umbrella-holding pedestrians into the air! At ten o'clock, I went to the No. 9 bus station on Avenue Foch, and waited until half past ten without seeing the shadow of the bus. I thought it must be because of the storm, and there would be no more buses running! So I changed direction and ran to Route Westmore to take the tram.</p>
<p>I got on the No. 1 tram, and the car was full of wet drops, and my clothes were all soaked, and I felt strangely cold and shivering. Looking out of the car window through the glass covered with sweat, not only were there no pedestrians, but even all kinds of vehicles were as rare as morning stars. In fact, it was only ten forty-five at this time, which should be the lively time in the city. There were several people in yellow uniforms in the car, probably employees of the tram company, who were saying, "There are two more No. 7 trams." This should be a great comfort to me, because I need the No. 7 tram to take me home.</p>
<p>Got off the bus at the Bund. The wind was even stronger, and the rain poured down on the earth like a torrent of water - although I had a small umbrella in my hand, it had lost its effect, and the handle had been broken by the wind - the cold rain soaked my whole body, and soon a car full of drowned chickens came, and I desperately squeezed into the car, seeming to have found a shelter, and suddenly felt the joy of finding a way out. At this time, the river water was pouring onto the shore, and the road had become small rivers, and the four- or five-inch-high street edges were submerged in the flowing water! On the road! It shouldn't be said that in the center of the small river, cars were driving past one by one, and they couldn't be as crazy and mighty as usual. Its half-submerged wheels were driving in the water, like the action of a motorboat.</p>
<p>Our tram was hesitating at the intersection of Broadway Road and Seward Road. The passengers meant to go to Seward Road, because Broadway Road was low-lying, and it was expected that the water would be very deep. But the driver, without stating the reason, said, "The foreign foreman has ordered to go to Broadway Road." So he braved the rain to get out of the car and chisel the road, chiseling for a full fifteen minutes. We really couldn't wait any longer, and on the one hand, we saw the water on the road gradually rising. As a result, we still took Seward Road, and we didn't verify the words of his foreign foreman "there is unexpected danger." At half past eleven, I arrived home safely.</p>
<p>Now! It is when I pick up my pen to write this news, the wind has stopped, the rain has stopped, the small river has been restored to a road, my wet clothes have dried; the lovely sun in the sky has also proudly displayed its great "power" ······ Everything is no different from usual, only our body and mind feel very comfortable and relaxed - therefore, I got an inspiration:</p>
<p>When the weather reaches a certain time, there will inevitably be an amazing storm. But one thing, we should understand that in the process of this storm, undoubtedly, every passerby will encounter considerable difficulties. At this time, we need not be alarmed, not escape, but endure and struggle! Because, in the near future, it will be our comfort and relaxation, the sunny day when the sun re-displays its great "power" proudly!</p>
<h3>Where is Your Home? By Jian Ping</h3>
<p>It was about five o'clock in the afternoon on the Saturday before last! The Zhenhu train, which I was sitting on from the pier, finally parked weakly at Zhenru Station. I was just trying to tidy up the books and newspapers that had been turned upside down on this long journey, so as not to imprison my tired body again when I arrived in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a chaotic sound of leather shoes and the English sound of "incarnate evil" broke the temporary silence in the carriage. I turned around and saw two wealthy customers of our Chinese future - college students - coming up, so I couldn't help but pay attention to them, but they simply didn't see a poor writer like me.</p>
<p>The car moved slowly again, and a carload of passengers stretched lazily in unison, which was naturally a quick indication that the destination was about to arrive; but the two college students, like fresh troops, were talking endlessly in their English, what "Churchill Sten," and what "Smith Smith" simply didn't stop talking. Of course, most of the passengers in the third-class car were from the business community, so they couldn't help but admire and worship this pair of outstanding college students, so they became even more proud.</p>
<p>"May I ask you two gentlemen! Where is your home?" Suddenly, an old man in cloth, like Cheng Yaojin who was killed halfway, asked them kindly:</p>
<p>"Well! Guangdong Xiangshan, we are from the same hometown," they couldn't help but answer him with some suspicion:</p>
<p>"Guangdong Xiangshan seems to be still within our country's territory, why do you two speak foreign languages?" the old man asked further:</p>
<p>"This ······" The college students hesitated for a long time, but still didn't answer. It just so happened that the car had arrived at the station at this time, which invisibly relieved their embarrassment.</p>

<h3>Not Enough Strength</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a poor young man under the age of twenty, and I am now a small employee in a small shop; my income is very meager, and very pitiful. My family is also extremely burdened by the economy; I have received letters asking me to send money back. But I have no ability, so I want to find a more noble occupation. But I have more than enough heart but not enough strength, so I sit in a city of sorrow every day, and I am oppressed by this vicious environment. I am really at a loss. May I ask what I should do with such an environment? Please give me a satisfactory answer in your publication. Thank you very much. Sincerely,</p>
<p>Respectfully, Gu Yaohua</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. Gu wants to find a more noble position in order to take care of his poor family; this is the common wish of people in the current society. "People want high mountains and water want low, " who doesn't want to earn more money to serve their parents and support their wives? However, Mr. Gu didn't think about it any further. Why do you "not have enough strength"? How can you remedy "not enough strength"? Then you will know that you must work harder to cultivate yourself. Knowledge, experience, and worldliness are all necessary for cultivation. If, because you want to provide for a poor family, you only know that you want to find a more noble position: this is a mirage, and you will never get your wish in your life. You must think further about how to cultivate yourself. Although this kind of success cannot be expected overnight, it will naturally reach the goal one day in the long run. I hope that those in the world who "do not have enough strength" will rise up and catch up and cultivate their strength; do not engage in the business of "blaming God and complaining about others" or "drawing cakes to satisfy hunger," this is feasible. We have received many letters, and although what they say is different, they all only hope for an increase in income, and cannot take into account the cultivation of ability. This kind of thinking of abandoning the root and pursuing the branch, or it is one of the important reasons for the current state of unrest in society. I will take advantage of Mr. Gu's inquiry to elaborate as above.</p>
<p>Here, the editor has one more word to tell the world for the sake of parents. People originally have the obligation to educate their children, but now because of their own economic difficulties, they cannot fully fulfill this obligation, which is a regrettable thing that cannot be avoided; but at least to the limit, before they "do not have enough strength," they must not blame them too severely. I often see many promising young people, because their parents supervise them too strictly, and thus flow into the path of recklessness and luck, or even resort to cheating, and finally their ambition is completely dispelled, which is really a pity. There are no parents in the world who do not love their children, please pay attention.</p>

<h3>War and Peace (34) (Four-Act Play) Ling He</h3>
<p>Act III Praise of Peace</p>
<p>Principal: Humph, isn't it? So now our only avenue is to resist desperately. We should resist for self-defense, we should fight for righteousness. (At this time, the military authorities have already reached the stairs.) As long as we continue to resist, the final victory will belong to the side of justice.</p>
<p>Confidential Secretary: That's right, what you said is the meaning of the government's long-term resistance. The current ceasefire is also a further step in long-term resistance.</p>
<p>Principal: (Seeing the military authorities stand up.) Sorry, I have delayed your official duties.</p>
<p>Military Authorities: It's nothing, please sit down. What's the matter?</p>
<p>Principal: It's about the ceasefire, I want to ask for advice. Recently, the general students are very resentful about this ceasefire. They say that such direct negotiations are too weak. They are all young people and do not understand the general situation of the country, and they always blame the government everywhere. So I want to know some important meanings about the ceasefire here, so that I can go back and enlighten them.</p>
<p>Military Authorities: Regarding the significance of this ceasefire, I think every Chinese citizen should understand; China is now so poor and exhausted, can it still withstand years of war? This is the first point. Second, the communists are rampant in Jiangxi, Hunan, and other places, disturbing the country, which is simply a hidden danger for the government, so we weigh the importance, and we must first settle the internal before we can resist the external. Third, China's weapons and equipment are too backward, which is very important. Can the broadsword team block airplanes and artillery? You don't know the situation on the battlefield, it is said that the tanks rolled over like a landslide, and our position was completely lost. The fourth point, I guess you know even if I don't say it. That is to say, our combat power cannot be balanced. Because they all want to preserve their strength. For example, last month the enemy was about to attack Nantianmen, and our army detected it in advance, so it specifically ordered a certain unit to attack Guyuan, towards the Luanping Avenue, to attack the enemy's right wing, but who knew that the commander of that unit disobeyed the order, made excuses and did not advance, and later Nantianmen, fought day and night, and sacrificed a mess. Not only that, some infantry teams are simply using the name of resisting Japan to actually expand their military strength. For example, a certain unit of the Northwest Army, without obeying the central government's order, knew how to move and came from southern Jin. What is the intention of this? Everyone knows that it is to seize territory. Since they have come, then the central government has always been generous, and of course it is not convenient to stop them. Now stationed in Dingzhou, claiming to be two divisions, but in fact there are only more than 4,000 people and more than 2,800 miscellaneous guns. So we reorganized and supplemented him, and ordered him to go to Luandong to participate in the war. But they took this opportunity to threaten military pay. Originally, when the reorganization was done, it was only said that the monthly pay was 33,000, but later they said that it would be 160,000 yuan a month, otherwise they would stay put. Look, in this situation, how embarrassed are our central troops? Is it difficult for us to be all fools? If the enemy knows about this kind of thing, they will really laugh until their stomachs hurt.</p>
<p>Principal: Yes, how many common people are angered to death by this situation.</p>
<p>Military Authorities: So, we can't stop the war for the sake of the common people. These grievances, please ask the gentleman to tell the people of the country.</p>

<h3>Colleen Moore's Return to the Silver Screen</h3>
<p>— by Her</p>
<p>The Number One Star of the Silent Era</p>
<p>Seeking Work Again After Four Years of Wandering</p>
<p>Colleen Moore's name, I guess it's not easy for us to forget. Although she has been away from the film industry for several years, we still feel very excited when we hear her name. She is not only the most popular star of the silent era, but what especially ties her to the hearts of Chinese people is that her oval face, matched with dark and shiny hair, cut straight across the eyebrows, is like a fashionable little Chinese girl, so Chinese audiences are of course not a few who are infatuated with her.</p>
<p>In the silent era, Colleen Moore was the highest-paid star. When she retired from the film industry in 1929, she had accumulated millions of fortunes. Some people say it was more than one million, as many as three million. At that time, she was only twenty-seven years old. Because she was rich, she wanted to enjoy a free life for a while, so she wandered around for four years. In these four years, she tried all kinds of ways to spend her time and seek other ways to express her talent besides movies. She hired famous teachers to study oil painting and sculpture. Without success, she went to study music. Because she had studied piano before entering the film industry, she thought she would definitely succeed this time. But in the end, she still couldn't calm her heart. As a result, she understood that besides movies, she had no other way out; besides work, there was no other way to find happiness. So she resolutely returned to Hollywood. This was last year.</p>
<p>MGM heard that Colleen Moore was back and signed a long-term contract with her. But for a year, no matter how many scripts were discussed, none were suitable for her status, so there was no work for a long time. Although MGM was cautious in handling things, it had to be so, but Colleen Moore came with a stomach full of enthusiasm, and what she needed was work, not money, so a year of idleness caused her great mental pain. Fortunately, Fox Company later saw that she had nothing to do and borrowed her to perform in a play called The Power and the Glory o. Since this film was successful, Hollywood has known that Colleen Moore's acting talent has not regressed because of four years of leisure; secondly, she is now a woman over thirty, her works have changed, and she is very suitable for playing the role of middle-aged women.</p>
<p>Colleen Moore's acting talent is beyond doubt. That kind of light and lively posture and delicate and appropriate expression can be said to be superb in the silent era. Unfortunately, she, like Manly Bickford, Li Ling Jishu, etc., suffered the sudden blow of the voice film invasion, which made her have to take a vacation herself. Anyone who has seen her films such as Lilac Time and Orchids and Ermine will feel endless regret for her. Just looking at her performing expression is so delicate, but how disappointing it is when she opens her mouth to sing. Of course, in the early days of sound films, there were many defects in all sound recording techniques. Now everything has improved, and it can make up for this defect in pronunciation. However, we also thought that the little girl with dark and shiny hair and a round face is no longer visible; the changes in four years make people feel a lot of vicissitudes!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Her First Mate"</h3>
<p>— Bai</p>
<p>— Cathay Film —</p>
<p>If we definitively acknowledge that movies are one of the tools for educating the public, then in my personal opinion, the performance of this film not only fails to adequately fulfill its mission, but is also wasteful.</p>
<p>In fact, the American and European film industries are truly nearing the eve of decline. Due to a lack of scripts, they are piecing together material from various sources, only to use topics that cater to the base desires of some people. They either use women's "sex appeal" to numb and deceive, or rely on slapstick comedy or thrilling adventures to elicit a brief laugh from the audience. This film, "Her First Mate," undoubtedly arose from this chaotic and poorly produced state, even though it is not as dazzling as usual!</p>
<p>Here! We must first explain the content of the story. It depicts John Honor, the son of a seafarer, who is forced by circumstances to not inherit his father's profession. Therefore, he goes through many hardships and later gets assistance from his wife to become the owner of a ferry. The screenwriter's main purpose is clearly to depict the true love of a couple sharing their lives, so the story ends in a comedic way. However, anyway, I think this point is precisely where the play's mistake lies. We must know that in this society, there are many people who behave like the protagonist in the story. It is inappropriate for the screenwriter not to strictly correct this, but to give it a gratifying praise. From what John Honor tells us on screen, although the screenwriter wants to portray him as a person with ambitious thoughts, in reality, he is just a complete mediocrity. To boast to his wife, he deceitfully claims to be a first mate. He wants to buy a sailboat, but insists on using his wife's money. Doesn't this clearly show us what a useless man is? And the result is these scenes. I think this kind of concept is really unacceptable - at least it will not make a good contribution to society.</p>
<p>In terms of performance, there is not much achievement. The director's skills are mediocre. However, as mentioned earlier, this play is not as dazzling as usual, but uses a humorous method to perform, which should be commendable. The actors are very faithful. The female lead Zasu Pitts can be said to be successful. The rest have very little room for development under the control of this kind of plot.</p>
<p>So, apart from the selection of material, which is somewhat realistic, this film is generally very ordinary.</p>
<p>Audience opinions</p>
<h3>Yesterday's Flowers: Review of "The Light of Motherhood"</h3>
<p>— Mo Naihe</p>
<p>Although "The Light of Motherhood" is already yesterday's flowers, it still has value for review. Because of the high artistic value of the work, I do not mind the details, and write some opinions.</p>
<p>In general, this is a valuable work. Because the writer admires the work too much, therefore, he finds two points to offer:</p>
<p>The first point is that when Jiahuan returns from Nanyang and meets his ex-wife Huiying, calling her "Mrs. Lin" seems to have a bit of a sour taste. A person who has been whipped in front and behind by the mine owner, and at the same time understands a little more about this society, and who has done practical revolutionary work before, should not have this sour taste. When Jiahuan called her "Mrs. Lin," some of the audience made mocking laughter, which damaged the "light" of this mother.</p>
<p>Another point: when the mother is grieving, the sudden appearance of the three comedic stars caused the audience to roar with laughter when they saw their comedy. This point distracted the audience's emotions that were being organized.</p>
<p>Finally, when Huiying and Jiahuan are seen walking outside by Xiaomei, and Xiaomei and Shulin are in the midst of passion and excitement and are called away by their mother to be rebuked, she says, "Why is mother going out with Mr. Zou?" A group of audience laughed, thinking that this sentence was well said. I feel that our Chinese cultural level is still very low, and therefore I feel that movies are so important in this era, and should bear the responsibility of promoting the cultural level of the masses.</p>
<p>That's what I felt, so I scribbled it down.</p>
<h3>Marlene's Lonely Residence</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>When Marlene Dietrich first ran from Germany to California, the Hollywood newspapers published Marlene's address and published photos of the houses in her home. Since then, her home has often been visited by uninvited guests, because Marlene Dietrich is inherently hospitable, and she welcomes and entertains all visitors, so her home is like an embassy, ​​with cars like flowing water and horses like dragons in front of the door. One day, a group of guests came to Marlene Dietrich's house, including old and young, a whole family group. When they arrived at Marlene's house, they gathered in the square in the garden, the young ones brought wine and food, and arranged them on the grass; a group of people sat on the grass and picnicked, the children sat on the ground singing, and the older ones drank wine. Marlene's garden was actually used as a picnic place, but Marlene was very polite to them. Since then, Marlene Dietrich's hospitality has been talked about for a while in Hollywood. Many nosy people in Hollywood had to go to Marlene Dietrich's home every day for a visit, but now Marlene Dietrich has left Paramount, and the gate of her former residence is tightly closed, and no one can enter and play at will, which makes people feel a lot of vicissitudes.</p>
<h3>Shen Xiling Receives Great Attention</h3>
<p>Shen Xiling, the director of "A Woman's Cry," has decided to continue his directing work after three months of in-depth research. He has now selected a new script, "Shanghai Twenty-Four Hours," and will start filming immediately. The film is written by Cai Shusheng, and it depicts the general life of Shanghai society. It is very lively and profound. The female lead in the film has been decided to be Ms. Zhu Qiuhen, and Zhou Boxun, who starred in "Spring Dream of the Old Capital" at Lianhua, is said to play an important role in the film.</p>
<h3>Zhang Shichuan Returns with a Full Load</h3>
<p>Zhang Shichuan and Cheng Bugao, who have been running around in North China, Central China, and West China to film new films, have returned to Shanghai with their team last night because a part of their work has been completed. According to Ms. Xu Lai, a standard beauty, they have made nine films on this trip. Although they have tasted the hardships of long journeys, the results are very satisfactory, which can be said to be a worthwhile trip. According to the plan for the interior scenes of the film, it will be screened one after another within the year, so the Mingxing studio has been in a state of tension again in recent days.</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Mirage Three-Cornered Moon (3)</h3>
<p>— Bolun</p>
<p>Mrs. Linbaga put on the airs of her in-laws and said, "Children, don't get too excited, or you will get nervous. And one thing, you have to sit down, because thinking while sitting is always better than thinking while standing." Elizabeth sighed. Kenna heard that he was studying law, and he should ask his mother about it. "Mother, when did you buy those stocks?" Mrs. Linbaga straightened her heavy body and said, "This is a long story. I'm left alone to take care of so many children. I was thinking of finding a way to get more money so that you can be happy in the future, so I took seventy-five thousand yuan to buy some stocks." Elizabeth screamed in shock, "Seventy-five thousand yuan." Mrs. Linbaga continued, "Later I added another fifty thousand. I'm not stupid, because someone told me that he was a very good person, and he said that Shuiyue Company's stock was the best." Kennas said, "What Shuiyue Company?" Mrs. Linbaga touched her head and said, "Let me think about it... it's probably a mine company, or a kind of metal mine... I think that person is very handsome, with a small mustache on his lips. He told me that Shuiyue Company's stock is very promising." Elizabeth interjected and asked, "What's that person's name?" Mrs. Linbaga said, "Let me think about it, this name was just on the tip of my tongue, how did I forget it for a while. His first name starts with S, um, Silver, no, it's not." Kennas said anxiously, "No matter what his name is. What happened after that?" Mrs. Linbaga said, "It was very good at first. Later it slowly fell. I thought it would rise. Later it really rose, but later it fell again, and later it rose again. I thought it wouldn't fall again this time. Who knew what I thought was right, it fell again, and it never climbed up again. Until a week ago, Mr. Bulizhi... now I remember, his name is Mr. Bulizhi, he told me to put some more money in. I gave him some more money, a lot of money. This morning he asked me to put money in again, but the money in the bank has been emptied." The four children asked together, "Then what happens?" Mrs. Linbaga said, "Then what happens?" I'm not a child, so I called a car and went home to wash my hair."</p>
<p>Elizabeth sighed, sat on the sofa, and held her head with both hands. The three children sat down one by one. Everyone was silent. Mrs. Linbaga was leisurely fanning herself, and in Lonad's room upstairs, the typewriter was making a da-da-da sound. Elizabeth suddenly thought of Dr. Stephen, who was a resourceful person and was good at giving people ideas. Whenever she met an accident, as long as he was by her side, she was not afraid of anything. "What do you do after you have no money?" This was the question she wanted to ask Stephen. How convenient, there was no need to ask, he came himself. Elizabeth had clearly heard his footsteps. Kennas was the first to speak, "Doctor, all our money is gone. Mother listened to a stranger and lost all the money!" Elizabeth heard this and jumped up angrily and said, "Are you saying this is all mother's fault? Aren't we all adults? Why didn't we know mother's temper earlier and take precautions?" (To be continued)</p>
